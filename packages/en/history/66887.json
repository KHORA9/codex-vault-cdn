The Trade Union Movement, which\r\nthen included scarcely 20 per cent of the adult male manual-working\r\nwage-earners, now includes over 60 per cent. Its legal and\r\nconstitutional status, which was then indefinite and precarious, has\r\nnow been explicitly defined and embodied in precise and absolutely\r\nexpressed statutes. Its internal organisation has been, in many cases,\r\nofficially adopted as part of the machinery of public administration.\r\nMost important of all, it has equipped itself with an entirely new\r\npolitical organisation, extending throughout the whole of Great\r\nBritain, inspired by large ideas embodied in a comprehensive programme\r\nof Social Reconstruction, which has already achieved the position\r\nof “His Majesty’s Opposition,” and now makes a bid for that of “His\r\nMajesty’s Government.” So great an advance within a single generation\r\nmakes the historical account of Trade Union development down to 1920\r\nequivalent to a new book.\r\n\r\nWe have taken the opportunity to revise, and at some points to amplify,\r\nour description of the origin and early struggles of Trade Unionism\r\nin this country. We have naturally examined the new material that has\r\nbeen made accessible during the past quarter of a century, in order\r\nto incorporate in our work whatever has thus been added to public\r\nknowledge. But we have not found it necessary to make any but trifling\r\nchanges in our original interpretation of the historical development.\r\nThe Home Office papers are now available in the Public Record Office\r\nfor the troubled period at the beginning of the nineteenth century;\r\nand these, together with the researches of Professor George Unwin, Mr.\r\nand Mrs. Hammond, Professor Graham Wallas, Mr. Mark Hovell, and Mr.\r\nM. Beer, have enabled us both to verify and to amplify our statements\r\nat certain points. For the recent history of Trade Unionism we have\r\nfound most useful the collections and knowledge of the Labour Research\r\nDepartment, established in 1913; and we gratefully acknowledge the\r\nassistance in facts, suggestions, and criticisms that we have had from\r\nMr. G. D. H. Cole and Mr. R. Page Arnot. We owe thanks, also, to Miss\r\nIvy Schmidt for unwearied assistance in research.\r\n\r\nThe reader must not expect to find, in this historical volume, either\r\nan analysis of Trade Union organisation, policy, and methods, or\r\nany judgement upon the validity of its assumptions, its economic\r\nachievements, or its limitations. On these things we have written at\r\ngreat length, and very explicitly, in our _Industrial Democracy_,\r\nand in other books described in the pages at the end of this volume,\r\nto which we must refer those desirous of knowing whether the Trade\r\nUnionism of which we now write merely the story is a good or a bad\r\nelement in industry and in the State.\r\n\r\n                                               SIDNEY and BEATRICE WEBB.\r\n\r\n 41 Grosvenor Road,\r\n Westminster,\r\n _January 1920_.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE TO THE ORIGINAL EDITION OF 1894\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is not our intention to delay the reader here by a conventional\r\npreface. As every one knows, the preface is never written until the\r\nstory is finished; and this story will not be finished in our time, or\r\nfor many generations after us. A word or two as to our method of work\r\nand its results is all that we need say before getting to our main\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThough we undertook the study of the Trade Union movement, not to\r\nprove any proposition of our own, but to discover what problems it had\r\nto present to us, our minds were not so blank on the subject that we\r\nhad no preconception of the character of these problems. We thought\r\nthey would almost certainly be economic, pointing a common economic\r\nmoral; and that expectation still seems to us so natural, that if it\r\nhad been fulfilled we should have accepted its fulfilment without\r\ncomment. But it was not so. Our researches were no sooner fairly in\r\nhand than we began to discover that the effects of Trade Unionism\r\nupon the conditions of labour, and upon industrial organisation and\r\nprogress, are so governed by the infinite technical variety of our\r\nproductive processes, that they vary from industry to industry and\r\neven from trade to trade; and the economic moral varies with them.\r\nWhere we expected to find an economic thread for a treatise, we found\r\na spider’s web; and from that moment we recognised that what we had\r\nfirst to write was not a treatise, but a history. And we saw that\r\neven a history would be impossible to follow unless we separated the\r\ngeneral history of the whole movement from the particular histories\r\nof thousands of trade societies, some of which have maintained a\r\ncontinuous existence from the last century, whilst others have cropped\r\nup, run their brief course, and disappeared. Thus, when we had finished\r\nour labour of investigating the records of practically every important\r\ntrade society from one end of the kingdom to the other, and accumulated\r\npiles of extracts, classified under endless trades and subdivisions\r\nof trades, we found that we must exclude from the first volume all\r\nbut a small selection from those documents which appeared to us most\r\nsignificant with regard to the development of the general movement.\r\nMany famous strikes and lock-outs, many interesting trade disputes,\r\nmany sensational prosecutions, and some furious outbursts of riot and\r\ncrime, together with many drier matters relating to particular trades,\r\nhave had either to be altogether omitted from our narrative, or else\r\naccorded a strictly subordinate reference in their relation to the\r\nhistory of Trade Unionism as a whole. All analysis of the economic\r\neffects of Trade Union action we reserve for a subsequent volume on the\r\nProblems of Trade Unionism, for which we shall draw more fully from the\r\nannals of the separate unions. And in that volume the most exacting\r\nseeker for economic morals will be more than satisfied; for there will\r\nbe almost as many economic morals drawn as societies described.\r\n\r\nThat history of the general movement, to which we have confined\r\nourselves here, will be found to be part of the political history\r\nof England. In spite of all the pleas of modern historians for less\r\nhistory of the actions of governments, and more descriptions of the\r\nmanners and customs of the governed, it remains true that history,\r\nhowever it may relieve and enliven itself with descriptions of the\r\nmanners and morals of the people, must, if it is to be history at\r\nall, follow the course of continuous organisations. The history\r\nof a perfectly democratic State would be at once the history of a\r\ngovernment and of a people. The history of Trade Unionism is the\r\nhistory of a State within our State, and one so jealously democratic\r\nthat to know it well is to know the English working man as no reader\r\nof middle-class histories can know him. From the early years of the\r\neighteenth century down to the present day, Democracy, Freedom of\r\nAssociation, _Laisser-faire_, Regulation of the Hours and Wages of\r\nLabour, Co-operative Production, Free Trade, Protection, and many other\r\ndistinct and often contradictory political ideals, have from time to\r\ntime seized the imagination of the organised wage-earners and made\r\ntheir mark on the course of the Trade Union movement. And, since 1867\r\nat least, wherever the ideals have left their mark on Trade Unionism,\r\nTrade Unionism has left its mark on politics. We shall be able to show\r\nthat some of those overthrows of our party governments which have\r\ncaused most surprise in the middle and upper classes, and for which the\r\nmost far-fetched reasons have been given by them and their journalists\r\nand historians after the event, carry their explanation on the surface\r\nfor any one who knows what the Trade Unionists of the period were\r\nthinking. Such demonstrations, however, will be purely incidental, as\r\nwe have written throughout of Trade Unionism for its own sake, and\r\nnot for that of the innumerable sidelights which it throws on party\r\npolitics.\r\n\r\nIn our concluding chapter, which we should perhaps offer as an appendix\r\nrather than as part of the regular plan of the volume, we have\r\nattempted to give a bird’s-eye view of the Trade Union world of to-day,\r\nwith its unequal distribution, its strong sectional organisation\r\nand defective political machinery, its new governing class of trade\r\nofficials--above all, its present state of transition in methods, aims,\r\nand policy, in the face of the multitude of unsettled constitutional,\r\neconomic, and political problems with which it stands confronted.\r\n\r\nA few words upon the work of collecting materials for our work may\r\nprove useful to those who may hereafter come to reap in the same field.\r\nIn the absence of any exhaustive treatment of any period of Trade\r\nUnion history we have to rely mainly upon our own investigations.\r\nBut every student of the subject must acknowledge the value of Dr.\r\nBrentano’s fertile researches into English working-class history, and\r\nof Mr. George Howell’s thoroughly practical exposition of the Trade\r\nUnionism of his own school and his own time. Perhaps the most important\r\npublished material on the subject is the _Report on Trade Societies and\r\nStrikes_ issued by the Social Science Association in 1860, a compact\r\nstorehouse of carefully sifted facts which compares favourably with the\r\nenormous bulk of scrappy and unverified information collected by the\r\nfive historic official inquiries into Trade Unionism between 1824 and\r\n1894. We have, moreover, found a great many miscellaneous facts about\r\nTrade Unions in periodical literature and ephemeral pamphlets in the\r\nvarious public libraries all over the country. To facilitate the work\r\nof future students we append to this volume a complete list of such\r\npublished materials as we have been able to discover. For the early\r\nhistory of combinations we have had to rely upon the public records,\r\nold newspapers, and miscellaneous contemporary pamphlets. Thus, our\r\nfirst two chapters are principally based upon the journals of the House\r\nof Commons, the minutes of the Privy Council, the publications of the\r\nRecord Office, and the innumerable broadsheet petitions to Parliament\r\nand old tracts relating to Trade which have been preserved in the\r\nBritish Museum, the Guildhall Library, and the invaluable collection\r\nof economic literature made by Professor H. S. Foxwell, St. John’s\r\nCollege, Cambridge.[1] Most important of all, for the period prior\r\nto 1835, are the many volumes of manuscript commentaries, newspaper\r\ncuttings, rules, reports, pamphlets, etc., left by Francis Place,\r\nand now in the British Museum. This unique collection, formed by the\r\nbusiest politician of his time, is indispensable, not only to the\r\nstudent of working-class movements, but also to any historian of\r\nEnglish political or social life during the first forty years of the\r\ncentury.[2]\r\n\r\nBut the greater part of our material, especially that relating to\r\nthe present century, has come from the Trade Unionists themselves.\r\nThe offices of the older unions contain interesting archives,\r\nsometimes reaching back to the eighteenth century--minute-books\r\nin which generations of diligent, if unlettered, secretaries, the\r\ntrue historians of a great movement, have struggled to record the\r\ndoings of their committees, and files of Trade Union periodicals,\r\nignored even by the British Museum, through which the plans and\r\naspirations of ardent working-class politicians and administrators\r\nhave been expounded month by month to the scattered branches of their\r\norganisations. We were assured at the outset of our investigation that\r\nno outsider would be allowed access to the inner history of some of the\r\nold-fashioned societies. But we have found this prevalent impression\r\nas to the jealous secrecy of the Trade Unions without justification.\r\nThe secretaries of old branches or ancient local societies have\r\nrummaged for us their archaic chests with three locks, dating from the\r\neighteenth century. The surviving leaders of a bygone Trade Unionism\r\nhave ransacked their drawers to find for our use the rules and minutes\r\nof their long-forgotten societies. In many a working man’s home in\r\nLondon and Liverpool, Newcastle and Dublin--above all, in Glasgow and\r\nManchester--the descendants of the old skilled handicraftsmen have\r\nunearthed “grandfather’s indentures,” or “father’s old card,” or a\r\ntattered set of rules, to help forward the investigation of a stranger\r\nwhom they dimly recognised as striving to record the annals of their\r\nclass. The whole of the documents in the offices of the great National\r\nand County Unions have been most generously placed at our disposal,\r\nfrom the printed reports and sets of rules to the private cash accounts\r\nand executive minute-books. In only one case has a General Secretary\r\nrefused us access to the old books of his society, and then simply on\r\nthe ground that he was himself proposing to write its history, and\r\nregarded us as rivals in the literary field.\r\n\r\nNor has this generous confidence been confined to the musty records\r\nof the past. In the long sojourns at the various industrial centres\r\nwhich this examination of local archives has necessitated, every\r\nfacility has been afforded to us for studying the actual working of\r\nthe Trade Union organisation of to-day. We have attended the sittings\r\nof the Trades Councils in most of the large towns; we have sat through\r\nnumerous branch and members’ meetings all over the country; and one of\r\nus has even enjoyed the exceptional privilege of being present at the\r\nprivate deliberations of the Executive Committees of various national\r\nsocieties, as well as at the special delegate meetings summoned by\r\nthe great federal Unions of Cotton-spinners, Cotton-weavers, and\r\nCoal-miners for the settlement of momentous issues of trade policy, and\r\nat the six weeks’ sessions in 1892 in which sixty chosen delegates of\r\nthe Amalgamated Society of Engineers overhauled the trade policy and\r\ninternal administration of that world-wide organisation.\r\n\r\nWe have naturally not confined ourselves to the workmen’s side of\r\nthe case. In almost every industrial centre we have sought out\r\nrepresentative employers in the different industries. From them we\r\nhave received many useful hints and criticisms. But, as might have\r\nbeen expected, the great captains of industry are, for the most part,\r\nabsorbed in the commercial side of their business, and are seldom\r\naccurately acquainted with the details of the past, or even of the\r\npresent, organisation of their workmen. Of more assistance in our task\r\nhave been the secretaries of the various employers’ associations.\r\nEspecially in the ship-building ports have these gentlemen placed\r\nat our disposal their experience in collective negotiation with the\r\ndifferent sections of labour, and the private statistics compiled\r\nby their associations. But of all the employing class we have found\r\nthe working managers and foremen, who have themselves often been\r\nworkmen, the best informed and most suggestive critics of Trade Union\r\norganisation and methods. We have often regretted that precisely this\r\nclass is the most difficult of access to the investigator of industrial\r\nproblems, and the least often called as witnesses before Royal\r\nCommissions.\r\n\r\nThe difficulty of welding into narrative form the innumerable details\r\nof the thousands of distinct organisations, and of constructing out\r\nof their separate chronicles anything like a history of the general\r\nmovement, has, we need hardly say, been very great. We are painfully\r\naware of the shortcomings of our work, both from a literary and from\r\na historical point of view. We have been encouraged in our task by\r\nthe conviction--strengthened as our investigation proceeded--that\r\nthe Trade Union records contain material of the utmost value to the\r\nfuture historian of industrial and political organisation, and that\r\nthese records are fast disappearing. Many of the older archives are\r\nin the possession of individual workmen, who are insensible of their\r\nhistorical value. Among the larger societies it is not uncommon to find\r\nonly one complete set of rules, reports, circulars, etc., in existence.\r\nA fire, a removal to new premises, or the death of an old secretary\r\nfrequently results in the disappearance of everything not actually in\r\ndaily office use. The keen investigator or collector will appreciate\r\nthe extremity of the vexation with which we have learnt on arriving at\r\nan ancient Trade Union centre that the “old rubbish” of the office had\r\nbeen “cleared out” six months before. The local public libraries, and\r\neven the British Museum, seldom contain any of the internal Trade Union\r\nrecords new or old. We have therefore not only collected every Trade\r\nUnion document that we could acquire, but we have made lengthy extracts\r\nfrom, and abstracts of, the piles of minute-books, reports, rules,\r\ncirculars, pamphlets, working-class newspapers, etc., which have been\r\nlent to us.\r\n\r\nThis collection of material, and, indeed, the wide scope of the\r\ninvestigation itself, would have been impossible if we had not had\r\nthe good fortune to secure the help of a colleague exceptionally well\r\nqualified for the work. In Mr. F. W. Galton we have found a devoted\r\nassistant, to whose unwearied labours we owe the extensive range of our\r\nmaterial and our statistics. Himself a skilled handicraftsman, and for\r\nsome time secretary to his Trade Union, he has brought to the task not\r\nonly keen intelligence and unremitting industry, but also a personal\r\nacquaintance with the details of Trade Union life and organisation\r\nwhich has rendered his co-operation of inestimable value. We have\r\nincorporated in our last chapter a graphic sketch from his pen of the\r\ninner life of a Trade Union.\r\n\r\nWe have, moreover, received the most cordial assistance from all\r\nquarters. If we were to acknowledge by name all those to whom our\r\nthanks are due, we should set forth a list of nearly all the Trade\r\nUnion officials in the kingdom. Individual acknowledgement is in their\r\ncase the less necessary, in that many of them are our valued personal\r\nfriends. Only second to this is our indebtedness to many of the great\r\n“captains of industry,” notably to Mr. Hugh Bell, of Middlesboro’,\r\nand Colonel Dyer, of Elswick, and the secretaries of employers’\r\nassociations, whose time has been freely placed at our disposal. To\r\nProfessor H. S. Foxwell, Mr. Frederic Harrison, Professor E. S. Beesly,\r\nMr. Robert Applegarth, and Mr. John Burns, M.P., we are especially\r\nindebted for the loan of many scarce pamphlets and working-class\r\njournals, whilst Mr. John Burnett and Mr. Henry Crompton have been\r\ngood enough to go through one or more of our chapters in proof, and to\r\nimprove them by numerous suggestions. And there are two dear comrades\r\nand friends to whose repeated revision of every line of our manuscript\r\nthe volume owes whatever approach to literary merit it may possess.\r\n\r\nThe bibliography has been prepared from our material by Mr. R. A.\r\nPeddie, to whom, as well as to Miss Apple-yard for the laborious task\r\nof verifying nearly all the quotations, our thanks are due.\r\n\r\n                                               SIDNEY and BEATRICE WEBB.\r\n\r\n 41 Grosvenor Road,\r\n Westminster,\r\n _April 1894_.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] Now in the Goldsmiths’ Library at the University of London.\r\n\r\n[2] Place’s _Letter Books_, together with an unpublished autobiography,\r\npreserved by his family, are now in the custody of Mr. Graham Wallas,\r\nwho is preparing a critical biography of this great reformer, which\r\nwill throw much new light on all the social and political events of\r\nEnglish history between 1798 and 1840 [published, 1st edition, 1898;\r\n2nd edition, 1918].\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS\r\n\r\n\r\n CHAP.

But\r\nalthough we shall briefly discuss the institutions which have sometimes\r\nbeen described as the forerunners of Trade Unionism, our narrative will\r\ncommence only from the latter part of the seventeenth century, before\r\nwhich date we have been unable to discover the existence in the British\r\nIsles of anything falling within our definition. Moreover, although\r\nit is suggested that analogous associations may have existed during\r\nthe Middle Ages in various parts of the Continent of Europe, we have\r\nno reason to suppose that such institutions exercised any influence\r\nwhatever upon the rise and development of the Trade Union Movement in\r\nthis country. We feel ourselves, therefore, warranted, as we are indeed\r\ncompelled, to limit our history exclusively to the Trade Unions of the\r\nUnited Kingdom.\r\n\r\nWe have, by our definition, expressly excluded from our history any\r\naccount of the innumerable instances in which the manual workers have\r\nformed ephemeral combinations against their social superiors. Strikes\r\nare as old as history itself. The ingenious seeker of historical\r\nparallels might, for instance, find in the revolt, 1490 B.C., of the\r\nHebrew brickmakers in Egypt against being required to make bricks\r\nwithout straw, a curious precedent for the strike of the Stalybridge\r\ncotton-spinners, A.D. 1892, against the supply of bad material for\r\ntheir work. But we cannot seriously regard, as in any way analogous\r\nto the Trade Union Movement of to-day, the innumerable rebellions of\r\nsubject races, the slave insurrections, and the semi-servile peasant\r\nrevolts of which the annals of history are full. These forms of the\r\n“labour war” fall outside our subject, not only because they in no case\r\nresulted in permanent associations, but because the “strikers” were not\r\nseeking to improve the conditions of a contract of service into which\r\nthey voluntarily entered.\r\n\r\nWhen, however, we pass from the annals of slavery or serfdom to those\r\nof the nominally free citizenship of the mediæval town, we are on\r\nmore debatable ground. We make no pretence to a thorough knowledge of\r\nEnglish town-life in the Middle Ages. But it is clear that there were\r\nat times, alongside of the independent master craftsmen, a number of\r\nhired journeymen and labourers, who are known to have occasionally\r\ncombined against their rulers and governors. These combinations are\r\nstated sometimes to have lasted for months, and even for years. As\r\nearly as 1383 we find the Corporation of the City of London prohibiting\r\nall “congregations, covins, and conspiracies of workmen.” In 1387\r\nthe serving-men of the London cordwainers, in rebellion against the\r\n“overseers of the trade,”[4] are reported to be aiming at making a\r\npermanent fraternity. Nine years later the serving-men of the saddlers,\r\n“called yeomen,” assert that they have had a fraternity of their\r\nown, “time out of mind,” with a livery and appointed governors. The\r\nmasters declared, however, that the association was only thirteen years\r\nold, and that its object was to raise wages.[5] In 1417 the tailors’\r\n“serving men and journeymen” in London have to be forbidden to dwell\r\napart from their masters as they hold assemblies and have formed a kind\r\nof association.[6] Nor were these fraternities confined to London. In\r\n1538 the Bishop of Ely reports to Cromwell that twenty-one journeymen\r\nshoemakers of Wisbech have assembled on a hill without the town, and\r\nsent three of their number to summon all the master shoemakers to meet\r\nthem, in order to insist upon an advance in their wages, threatening\r\nthat “there shall none come into the town to serve for that wages\r\nwithin a twelve month and a day, but we woll have an harme or a legge\r\nof hym, except they woll take an othe as we have doon.”[7]\r\n\r\nThese instances derived from the very fragmentary materials as yet\r\nprinted, suggest that a more complete examination of the unpublished\r\narchives might possibly disclose a whole series of journeymen\r\nfraternities, and enable us to determine the exact constitution of\r\nthese associations. It is, for instance, by no means clear whether the\r\ninstances cited were strikes against employers, or revolts against\r\nthe authority of the gild. Our impression is that the case of the\r\nWisbech shoemakers, and possibly some of the others, represent the\r\nembryo stage of a Trade Union. Supposing, therefore, that further\r\ninvestigation were to prove that such ephemeral combinations by hired\r\njourneymen against their employers did actually pass into durable\r\nassociations of like character, we should be constrained to begin our\r\nhistory with the fourteenth or fifteenth century. But, after detailed\r\nconsideration of every published instance of a journeyman’s fraternity\r\nin England, we are fully convinced that there is as yet no evidence\r\nof the existence of any such durable and independent combination of\r\nwage-earners against their employers during the Middle Ages.\r\n\r\nThere are certain other cases in which associations during the\r\nfifteenth and sixteenth centuries, which are sometimes assumed to have\r\nbeen composed of journeymen,[8] maintained a continuous existence. But\r\nin all these cases, so far as we have been able to investigate them,\r\nthe “Bachelors’ Company,” presumed to be a journeymen’s fraternity,\r\nformed a subordinate department of the masters’ gild, by the rulers\r\nof which it was governed. It will be obvious that associations in\r\nwhich the employers dispensed the funds and appointed the officers\r\ncan bear no analogy to modern Trade Unions. Moreover, these “yeoman”\r\norganisations or “Bachelors’ Companies” do not appear to have long\r\nsurvived the sixteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe explanation of the tardy growth of stable independent combination\r\namong hired journeymen is, we believe, to be found in the prospects of\r\neconomic advancement which the skilled handicraftsman still possessed.\r\nWe do not wish to suggest the existence of any Golden Age in which each\r\nskilled workman was his own master, and the wage system was unknown.\r\nThe earliest records of English town history imply the presence of\r\nhired journeymen, who were not always contented with their wages. But\r\nthe apprenticed journeyman in the skilled handicrafts belonged, until\r\ncomparatively modern times, to the same social grade as his employer,\r\nand was indeed usually the son of a master in the same or an analogous\r\ntrade. So long as industry was carried on mainly by small masters,\r\neach employing but one or two journeymen, the period of any energetic\r\nman’s service as a hired wage-earner cannot normally have exceeded\r\na few years, and the industrious apprentice might reasonably hope,\r\nif not always to marry his master’s daughter, at any rate to set up\r\nin business for himself. Any incipient organisation would always be\r\nlosing its oldest and most capable members, and would of necessity\r\nbe confined, like the Coventry journeymen’s Gild of St. George, to\r\n“the young people,”[9] or like the ephemeral fraternity of journeymen\r\ntailors of 1415-17, to “a race at once youthful and unstable,”[10] from\r\nwhose inexperienced ranks it would be hard to draw a supply of good\r\nTrade Union leaders. We are therefore able to understand how it is\r\nthat, whilst industrial oppression belongs to all ages, it is not until\r\nthe changing conditions of industry had reduced to an infinitesimal\r\nchance the journeyman’s prospect of becoming himself a master, that\r\nwe find the passage of ephemeral combinations into permanent trade\r\nsocieties. This inference is supported by the experience of an\r\nanalogous case in the Lancashire of to-day. The “piecers,” who assist\r\nat the “mules,” are employed and paid by the operative cotton-spinners\r\nunder whom they work. The “big piecer” is often an adult man, quite\r\nas skilled as the spinner himself, from whom, however, he receives\r\nvery inferior wages. But although the cotton operatives display a\r\nremarkable aptitude for Trade Unionism, attempts to form an independent\r\norganisation among the piecers have invariably failed. The energetic\r\nand competent piecer is always looking forward to becoming a spinner,\r\ninterested rather in reducing than in raising piecers’ wages. The\r\nleaders of any incipient movement among the piecers have necessarily\r\nfallen away from it on becoming themselves employers of the class\r\nfrom which they have been promoted. But though the Lancashire piecers\r\nhave always failed to form an independent Trade Union, they are not\r\nwithout their associations, in the constitution of which we may find\r\nsome hint of the relation between the gild of the master craftsmen\r\nand the Bachelors’ Company or other subordinate association in which\r\njourneymen may possibly have been included. The spinners have, for\r\ntheir own purposes, brigaded the piecers into piecers’ associations.\r\nThese associations, membership of which is usually compulsory, form a\r\nsubordinate part of the spinners’ Trade Union, the officers of which\r\nfix and collect the contributions, draw up the rules, dispense the\r\nfunds, and in every way manage the affairs, without in the slightest\r\ndegree consulting the piecers themselves. It is not difficult to\r\nunderstand that the master craftsmen who formed the court of a mediæval\r\ngild might, in a similar way, have found it convenient to brigade the\r\njourneymen or other inferior members of the trade into a subordinate\r\nfraternity, for which they fixed the quarterly dues, appointed the\r\n“wardens” or “wardens’ substitutes,” administered the funds, and in\r\nevery way controlled the affairs, without admitting the journeymen to\r\nany voice in the proceedings.[11]\r\n\r\nIf further proof were needed that it was the prospect of economic\r\nadvancement that hindered the formation of permanent combinations\r\namong the hired journeymen of the Middle Ages, we might adduce\r\nthe fact that certain classes of skilled manual workers, who had\r\nno chance of becoming employers, do appear to have succeeded in\r\nestablishing long-lived combinations which had to be put down by law.\r\nThe masons, for instance, had long had their “yearly congregations\r\nand confederacies made in their general chapiters assembled,” which\r\nwere expressly prohibited by Act of Parliament in 1425.[12] And the\r\ntilers of Worcester are ordered by the Corporation in 1467 to “sett\r\nno parliament amonge them.”[13] It appears probable, indeed, that\r\nthe masons, wandering over the country from one job to another, were\r\nunited, not in any local gild, but in a trade fraternity of national\r\nextent. Such an association may, if further researches throw light upon\r\nits constitution and working, not improbably be found to possess some\r\npoints of resemblance to the Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons\r\nof the present day, which was established in 1832. But, unlike the\r\noperative in the modern building trades, the mason of the Middle\r\nAges served, not a master _entrepreneur_, but the customer himself,\r\nwho provided the materials, supervised the work, and engaged, at\r\nspecified daily rates, both the skilled mechanics and their labourers\r\nor apprentices.[14] In contrast with the handicraftsmen of the towns,\r\nthe masons, tilers, etc. remained, from the completion of their\r\napprenticeship to the end of their working lives, in one and the same\r\neconomic position, a position which appears to have been intermediate\r\nbetween those of the master craftsman and the journeyman of the other\r\ntrades. Like the jobbing carpenter of the country village of to-day,\r\nthey were independent producers, each controlling the processes of\r\nhis own craft, and dealing directly with the customer. But unlike the\r\ntypical master craftsman of the handicraft trades they sold nothing but\r\nlabour, and their own labour only, at regulated customary rates, and\r\nwere unconcerned, therefore, with the making of profit, whether upon\r\nthe purchase and sale of materials or upon the hiring of subordinate\r\nworkers.[15] The stability of their combinations was accordingly not\r\nprevented by those influences which, as we have suggested, proved fatal\r\nin England to the corresponding attempts of the hired journeymen of the\r\nhandicrafts.\r\n\r\nBut if the example of the building trades in the Middle Ages supports\r\nour inference as to the cause of the tardy growth of combination\r\namong the journeymen in other trades, the “yearly congregations and\r\nconfederacies” of the masons might themselves demand our attention as\r\ninstances of early Trade Unionism. Of the constitution, function, or\r\nultimate development of these mediæval associations in the building\r\ntrades we know unfortunately next to nothing.[16] It is remarkable\r\nthat there is, so far as we are aware, no trace of their existence in\r\nGreat Britain later than the fifteenth century. During the eighteenth\r\ncentury there is, as we shall see, no lack of information as to\r\ncombinations of workmen in nearly every other skilled trade. The\r\nemployers appear to have been perpetually running to Parliament to\r\ncomplain of the misdeeds of their workmen. But of combinations in the\r\nbuilding trades we have found scarcely a trace until the very end of\r\nthat century. If, therefore, adhering strictly to the letter of our\r\ndefinition, we accepted the masons’ confederacy as a Trade Union,\r\nwe should be compelled to regard the building trades as presenting\r\nthe unique instance of an industry which had a period of Trade\r\nUnionism in the fifteenth century, then passed for several centuries\r\ninto a condition in which Trade Unionism was impossible, and finally\r\nchanged once more to a state in which Trade Unions flourished. Our\r\nown impression is however that the “congregations and confederacies”\r\nof the masons are more justly to be considered the embryonic stage\r\nof a gild of master craftsmen than of a Trade Union. There appears\r\nto us to be a subtle distinction between the economic position of\r\nworkers who hire themselves out to the individual consumer direct,\r\nand those who, like the typical Trade Unionist of to-day, serve an\r\nemployer who stands between them and the actual consumers, and who\r\nhires their labour in order to make out of it such a profit as will\r\nprovide him with his interest on capital and “wages of management.” We\r\nsuggest that, with the growing elaboration of domestic architecture,\r\nthe superior craftsmen tended more and more to become employers,\r\nand any organisations of such craftsmen to pass insensibly into the\r\nordinary type of masters’ gild.[17] Under such a system of industry the\r\njourneymen would possess the same prospects of economic advancement\r\nthat hindered the growth of stable combinations in the ordinary\r\nhandicrafts, and in this fact may lie the explanation of the striking\r\nabsence of evidence of any Trade Unionism in the building trades right\r\ndown to the eighteenth century.[18] When, however, the capitalist\r\nbuilder or contractor began to supersede the master mason, master\r\nplasterer, etc., and this class of small _entrepreneurs_ had again to\r\ngive place to a hierarchy of hired workers, Trade Unions, in the modern\r\nsense, began, as we shall see, to arise. “Just as we found the small\r\nmaster in the sixteenth century struggling to adapt and appropriate the\r\ntraditions of the superseded handicraft organisation, so we shall find\r\nthe journeyman at the close of the seventeenth century [in some trades\r\nand at the close of the eighteenth century in others] endeavouring to\r\nbuild up a new status out of the ruins of the small master.”[19]\r\n\r\nWe have dwelt at some length upon these ephemeral associations of\r\nwage-earners and on the journeymen fraternities of the Middle Ages,\r\nbecause it might plausibly be argued that they were in some sense\r\nthe predecessors of the Trade Union. But strangely enough it is not\r\nin these institutions that the origin of Trade Unionism has usually\r\nbeen sought. For the predecessor of the modern Trade Union, men have\r\nturned, not to the mediæval associations of the wage-earners, but to\r\nthose of their employers--that is to say, the Craft Gilds.[20] The\r\noutward resemblance of the Trade Union to the Craft Gild had long\r\nattracted the attention, both of the friends and the enemies of Trade\r\nUnionism; but it was the publication in 1870 of Professor Brentano’s\r\nbrilliant study on the “Origin of Trades Unions” that gave form to the\r\npopular idea.[21] Without in the least implying that any connection\r\ncould be traced between the mediæval gild and the modern Trade Union,\r\nDr. Brentano suggested that the one was in so far the successor of the\r\nother, that both institutions had arisen “under the breaking up of an\r\nold system, and among the men suffering from this disorganisation, in\r\norder that they might maintain independence and order.”[22] And when\r\nGeorge Howell prefixed to his history of Trade Unionism a paraphrase\r\nof Dr. Brentano’s account of the gilds, it became commonly accepted\r\nthat the Trade Union had, in some undefined way, really originated from\r\nthe Craft Gild.[23] We are therefore under the obligation of digressing\r\nto examine the relation between the mediæval gild and the modern Trade\r\nUnion. If it could be shown that the Trade Unions were, in any way, the\r\ndescendants of the old gilds, it would clearly be the origin of the\r\nlatter that we should have to trace.\r\n\r\nThe supposed descent in this country of the Trade Unions from the\r\nmediæval Craft Gilds rests, as far as we have been able to discover,\r\nupon no evidence whatsoever. The historical proof is all the other\r\nway. In London, for instance, more than one Trade Union has preserved\r\nan unbroken existence from the eighteenth century. The Craft Gilds\r\nstill exist in the City Companies, and at no point in their history\r\ndo we find the slightest evidence of the branching off from them of\r\nindependent journeymen’s societies. By the eighteenth century the\r\nLondon journeymen had in nearly all cases lost whatever participation\r\nthey may possibly once have possessed in the Companies, which had for\r\nthe most part already ceased to have any connection with the trades\r\nof which they bore the names.[24] It is sometimes suggested that the\r\nLondon Companies have had an exceptional history, and that in towns\r\nin which the gilds underwent a more normal development they may have\r\ngiven rise to the modern trade society. So far as Great Britain is\r\nconcerned we have satisfied ourselves that this suggestion rests on no\r\nbetter foundation than the other. Neither in Bristol nor in Preston,\r\nneither in Newcastle nor in Glasgow, have we been able to trace the\r\nslightest connection between the slowly dying gilds and the upstarting\r\nTrade Unions. At Sheffield J. M. Ludlow, basing himself on an account\r\nby Frank Hill, once expressly declared[25] that direct affiliation\r\ncould be proved. Diligent inquiry into the character and history of the\r\nstill flourishing Cutlers’ Company demonstrates that this exclusively\r\nmasters’ association at no time originated or engendered any of the\r\nnumerous Trade Unions with which Sheffield abounds. There remains the\r\ncase of Dublin, where some of the older unions themselves claim descent\r\nfrom the gilds. Here, too, careful search reveals, not only the absence\r\nof any affiliation or direct descent, but also the impossibility of\r\nany organic connection between the exclusively Protestant gilds which\r\nwere not abolished until 1842, and the mainly Roman Catholic Trade\r\nUnions which attained their greatest influence many years before.[26]\r\nWe assert, indeed, with some confidence, that in no case did any Trade\r\nUnion in the United Kingdom arise, either directly or indirectly, by\r\ndescent, from a Craft Gild.\r\n\r\nIt is often taken for granted that the Trade Union, whatever may have\r\nbeen its origin, represents the same elements, and plays the same part\r\nin the industrial system of the nineteenth century, as the Craft Gild\r\ndid in that of the Middle Ages. A brief analysis of what is known of\r\nthe gilds will be sufficient to show that these organisations were\r\neven in their purest days essentially different, both in structure and\r\nfunction, from the modern trade society.\r\n\r\nFor the purpose of this comparison it will be unnecessary for us to\r\ndiscuss the rival theories of historians as to the nature and origin of\r\nthe Craft Gilds. We may agree, on the one hand, with Dr. Brentano[27]\r\nin maintaining that the free craftsmen associated in order to stop\r\nthe deterioration of their condition and encroachments on their\r\nearnings, and to protect themselves against “the abuse of power on the\r\npart of the lords of the town, who tried to reduce the free to the\r\ndependence of the unfree.” On the other hand, we may believe with Dr.\r\nCunningham[28] that the Craft Gilds were “called into being, not out of\r\nantagonism to existing authorities, but as new institutions, to which\r\nspecial parts of their own duties were delegated by the burgh officers\r\nor the local Gild Merchant,” as a kind of “police system,” in fact, by\r\nwhich the community controlled the local industries in the interest\r\nof the consumer. Or again, we may accept the middle view advanced by\r\nSir William Ashley,[29] that the gilds were self-governing bodies of\r\ncraftsmen, initiating their own trade regulations, the magistrates or\r\ntown council having a real, if somewhat vague, authority to sanction or\r\nveto these ordinances for the good of the citizens. Each of these three\r\nviews is supported by numerous instances, and to determine which theory\r\nrepresents the rule and which the exception would involve a statistical\r\nknowledge of Craft Gilds for which the material has not yet been\r\ncollected. It will be evident that, if Dr. Cunningham’s theory of the\r\nCraft Gild is the correct one, there can be no essential resemblance\r\nbetween these semi-municipal bodies and the Trade Unions of to-day.\r\nDr. Brentano, however, produces ample evidence that, in some cases\r\nat any rate, the gilds acted, not with any view to the protection of\r\nthe consumer, but, like the Trade Unions, for the furtherance of the\r\ninterests of their own members--that is, of one class of producers.\r\nAccepting for the moment the view that the Craft Gild, like the\r\nTrade Union, or the Employers’ Association, belonged to the genus of\r\n“associations of producers,” let us examine briefly how far the gild\r\nwas similar to modern combinations of wage-earners.\r\n\r\nNow, the central figure of the gild organisation, in all instances, and\r\nat all periods of its development, was the master craftsman, owning\r\nthe instruments of production, and selling the product. Opinions may\r\ndiffer as to the position of the journeymen in the gild or to the\r\nextent of the prevalence of subordinate or semi-servile labour outside\r\nit. Different views may be entertained as to the reality of that\r\nregard for the interests of the consumer which forms the ostensible\r\nobject of many gild ordinances. But throughout the whole range of gild\r\nhistory the master craftsman, controlling the processes and selling\r\nthe products of the labour of his little industrial group, was the\r\npractical administrator of, and the dominant influence in, the gild\r\nsystem.[30] In short, the typical gild member was not wholly, or even\r\nchiefly, a manual worker. From the first he supplied not only whatever\r\ncapital was needed in his industry, but also that knowledge of the\r\nmarkets for both raw material and product, and that direction and\r\ncontrol which are the special functions of the _entrepreneur_. The\r\neconomic functions and political authority of the gild rested, not upon\r\nits assumed inclusion of practically the whole body of manual workers,\r\nbut upon the presence within it of the real directors of industry of\r\nthe time. In the modern Trade Union, on the contrary, we find, not an\r\nassociation of _entrepreneurs_, themselves controlling the processes\r\nof their industry, and selling its products, but a combination of\r\nhired wage-workers, serving under the direction of industrial captains\r\nwho are outside the organisation. The separation into distinct social\r\nclasses of the capitalist and the brainworker on the one hand, and the\r\nmanual workers on the other--the substitution, in fact, of a horizontal\r\nfor a vertical cleavage of society--vitiates any treatment of the Trade\r\nUnion as the analogue of the Craft Gild.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, to regard the typical Craft Gild as the predecessor\r\nof the modern Employers’ Association or capitalist syndicate would,\r\nin our opinion, be as great a mistake as to believe, with George\r\nHowell, that it was the “early prototype” of the Trade Union. Dr.\r\nBrentano himself laid stress on the fact, afterwards brought into\r\nspecial prominence by Dr. Cunningham, that the Craft Gild was looked\r\nupon as the representative of the interests, not of any one class\r\nalone, but of the three distinct and somewhat antagonistic elements\r\nof modern society, the capitalist _entrepreneur_, the manual worker,\r\nand the consumer at large. We do not need to discuss the soundness of\r\nthe mediæval lack of faith in unfettered competition as a guarantee\r\nof the genuineness and good quality of wares. Nor are we concerned\r\nwith their assumption of the identity of interest between all classes\r\nof the community. It seemed a matter of course to the statesman, no\r\nless than to the public, that the leading master craftsmen of the\r\ntown should be entrusted with the power and the duty of seeing that\r\nneither themselves nor their competitors were permitted to lower the\r\nstandard of production. “The Fundamental Ground,” says the petition\r\nof the Carpenters’ Company in 1681, “of Incorporating Handicraft\r\nTrades and Manual Occupations into distinct Companies was to the\r\nend that all Persons using such Trades should be brought into one\r\nUniform Government and Corrected and Regulated by Expert and Skilful\r\nGovernors, under certain Rules and Ordinances appointed to that\r\npurpose.”[31] The leading men of the gild became, in effect, officers\r\nof the municipality, charged with the protection of the public from\r\nadulteration and fraud. When, therefore, we remember that the Craft\r\nGild was assumed to represent, not only all the grades of producers\r\nin a particular industry, but also the consumers of the product,\r\nand the community at large, the impossibility of finding, in modern\r\nsociety, any single inheritor of its multifarious functions will\r\nbecome apparent. The powers and duties of the mediæval gild have, in\r\nfact, been broken up and dispersed. The friendly society and the\r\nTrade Union, the capitalist syndicate and the employers’ association,\r\nthe factory inspector and the Poor Law relieving officer, the School\r\nAttendance officer, and the municipal officers who look after\r\nadulteration and inspect our weights and measures--all these persons\r\nand institutions might, with equal justice, be put forward as the\r\nsuccessors of the Craft Gild.[32]\r\n\r\nAlthough there is an essential difference in the composition of the\r\ntwo organisations, the popular theory of their resemblance is easily\r\naccounted for. First, there are the picturesque likenesses which Dr.\r\nBrentano discovered--the regulations for admission, the box with its\r\nthree locks, the common meal, the titles of the officers, and so forth.\r\nBut these are to be found in all kinds of association in England.\r\nThe Trade Union organisations share them with the local friendly\r\nsocieties, or sick clubs, which have existed all over England for the\r\nlast two centuries. Whether these features were originally derived\r\nfrom the Craft Gilds or not, it is practically certain that the early\r\nTrade Unions took them, in the vast majority of cases, not from the\r\ntraditions of any fifteenth-century organisation, but from the existing\r\nlittle friendly societies around them. In some cases the parentage of\r\nthese forms and ceremonies might be ascribed with as much justice to\r\nthe mystic rites of the Freemasons as to the ordinances of the Craft\r\nGilds. The fantastic ritual peculiar to the Trade Unionism of 1829-34,\r\nwhich we shall describe in a subsequent chapter, was, as we shall see,\r\ntaken from the ceremonies of the Friendly Society of Oddfellows. But\r\nwe are informed that it bears traces of being an illiterate copy of a\r\nmasonic ritual. In our own times the “Free Colliers of Scotland,” an\r\nearly attempt at a national miners’ union, were organised into “Lodges”\r\nunder a “Grand Master,” with much of the terminology and some of the\r\ncharacteristic forms of Freemasonry. No one would, however, assert\r\nany essential resemblance between the village sick club and the trade\r\nsociety, still less between Freemasonry and Trade Unionism. The only\r\ncommon feature between all these is the spirit of association, clothing\r\nitself in more or less similar picturesque forms.\r\n\r\nBut other resemblances between the gild and the union brought out\r\nby Dr. Brentano are more to the point. The fundamental purpose of\r\nthe Trade Union is the protection of the Standard of Life--that is\r\nto say, the organised resistance to any innovation likely to tend\r\nto the degradation of the wage-earners as a class. That some social\r\norganisation for the protection of the Standard of Life was necessary\r\nwas a leading principle of the Craft Gild, as it was, in fact, of the\r\nwhole mediæval order. “Our forefathers,” wrote the Emperor Sigismund\r\nin 1434, “have not been fools. The crafts have been devised for this\r\npurpose: that everybody by them should earn his daily bread, and nobody\r\nshall interfere with the craft of another. By this the world gets rid\r\nof its misery, and every one may find his livelihood.”[33] But in this\r\nrespect the Trade Union does not so much resemble the Craft Gild, as\r\nreassert what was once the accepted principle of mediæval society,\r\nof which the gild policy was only one manifestation. We do not wish,\r\nin our historical survey of the Trade Union Movement, to enter into\r\nthe far-reaching controversy as to the political validity either of\r\nthe mediæval theory of the compulsory maintenance of the Standard of\r\nLife, or of such analogous modern expedients as Collective Bargaining\r\non the one hand, or Factory Legislation on the other. Nor do we wish\r\nto imply that the mediæval theory was at any time so effectively and\r\nso sincerely carried out as really to secure to every manual worker a\r\ncomfortable maintenance. We are concerned only with the historical fact\r\nthat, as we shall see, the artisans of the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\ncenturies sought to perpetuate those legal or customary regulations of\r\ntheir trade which, as they believed, protected their own interests.\r\nWhen these regulations fell into disuse the workers combined to secure\r\ntheir enforcement. When legal redress was denied, the operatives, in\r\nmany instances, took the matter into their own hands, and endeavoured\r\nto maintain, by Trade Union regulations, what had once been prescribed\r\nby law. In this respect, and practically in this respect only, do we\r\nfind any trace of the gild in the Trade Union.\r\n\r\nLet us now turn from the hypothetical origin of Trade Unionism to the\r\nrecorded facts. We have failed to discover in the manuscript records of\r\ncompanies or municipal corporations, in the innumerable trade pamphlets\r\nand broadsheets of the time, or in the Journals of the House of\r\nCommons, any evidence of the existence, prior to the latter half of the\r\nseventeenth century,[34] or indeed much before the very close of that\r\ncentury, of continuous associations of wage-earners for maintaining\r\nor improving the conditions of their working lives. And when we\r\nremember that during the latter decades of the seventeenth century\r\nthe employers of labour, and especially the industrial “companies” or\r\ncorporations, memorialised the House of Commons on every conceivable\r\ngrievance which affected their particular trade, the absence of all\r\ncomplaints of workmen’s combinations suggests to us that few, if any,\r\nsuch combinations existed.[35] We do, however, discover in the latter\r\nhalf of the seventeenth century various traces of sporadic combinations\r\nand associations, some of which appear to have maintained in obscurity\r\na continuous existence. In the early years of the eighteenth century\r\nwe find isolated complaints of combinations “lately entered into”\r\nby the skilled workers in certain trades. As the century progresses\r\nwe watch the gradual multiplication of these complaints, met by\r\ncounter-accusations presented by organised bodies of workmen. From the\r\nmiddle of the century the Journals of the House of Commons abound in\r\npetitions and counter-petitions revealing the existence of journeymen’s\r\nassociations in most of the skilled trades. And finally, we may infer\r\nthe wide extension of the movement from the steady multiplication of\r\nthe Acts against combinations in particular industries, and their\r\nculmination in the comprehensive statute of 1799 forbidding all\r\ncombinations whatsoever.\r\n\r\nIf we examine the evidence of the rise of combinations in particular\r\ntrades, we see the Trade Union springing, not from any particular\r\ninstitution, but from every opportunity for the meeting together\r\nof wage-earners of the same occupation. Adam Smith remarked that\r\n“people of the same trade seldom meet together, even for merriment\r\nand diversion, but the conversation ends in a conspiracy against the\r\npublic, or in some contrivance to raise prices.”[36] And there is\r\nactual evidence of the rise of one of the oldest of the existing Trade\r\nUnions out of a gathering of the journeymen “to take a social pint of\r\nporter together.”[37] More often it is a tumultuous strike, out of\r\nwhich grows a permanent organisation. Elsewhere, as we shall see, the\r\nworkers meet to petition the House of Commons, and reassemble from\r\ntime to time to carry on their agitation for the enactment of some new\r\nregulation, or the enforcement of an existing law. In other instances\r\nwe shall find the journeymen of a particular trade frequenting\r\ncertain public-houses, at which they hear of situations vacant, and\r\nthe “house of call” becomes thus the nucleus of an organisation. Or\r\nwe watch the journeymen in a particular trade declaring that “it has\r\nbeen an ancient custom in the kingdom of Great Britain for divers\r\nArtists to meet together and unite themselves in societies to\r\npromote Amity and true Christian Charity,” and establishing a sick\r\nand funeral club, which invariably proceeds to discuss the rates of\r\nwages offered by the employers, and insensibly passes into a Trade\r\nUnion with friendly benefits.[38] And if the trade is one in which\r\nthe journeymen frequently travel in search of work, we note the slow\r\nelaboration of systematic arrangements for the relief of these “tramps”\r\nby their fellow-workers in each town through which they pass, and\r\nthe inevitable passage of this far-extending tramping society into a\r\nnational Trade Union.[39]\r\n\r\nAll these, however, are but opportunities for the meeting of journeymen\r\nof the same trade. They do not explain the establishment of continuous\r\norganisations of the wage-earners in the seventeenth and eighteenth\r\nrather than in the fifteenth or sixteenth centuries. The essential\r\ncause of the growth of durable associations of wage-earners must\r\nlie in something peculiar to the later centuries. This fundamental\r\ncondition of Trade Unionism we discover in the economic revolution\r\nthrough which certain industries were passing. In all cases in which\r\nTrade Unions arose, the great bulk of the workers had ceased to be\r\nindependent producers, themselves controlling the processes, and\r\nowning the materials and the product of their labour, and had passed\r\ninto the condition of lifelong wage-earners, possessing neither the\r\ninstruments of production nor the commodity in its finished state.\r\n“From the moment that to establish a given business more capital is\r\nrequired than a journeyman can easily accumulate within a few years,\r\ngild mastership--the mastership of the masterpiece--becomes little more\r\nthan a name.... Skill alone is valueless, and is soon compelled to hire\r\nitself out to capital.... Now begins the opposition of interest between\r\nemployers and employed, now the latter begin to group themselves\r\ntogether; now rises the trade society.”[40] Or, to express this\r\nIndustrial Revolution in more abstract terms, we may say, in the words\r\nof Dr. Ingram, that “the whole modern organisation of labour in its\r\nadvanced forms rests on a fundamental fact which has spontaneously and\r\nincreasingly developed itself--namely, the definite separation between\r\nthe functions of the capitalist and the workman, or, in other words,\r\nbetween the direction of industrial operations and their execution in\r\ndetail.”[41]\r\n\r\nIt is often assumed that the divorce of the manual worker from the\r\nownership of the means of production resulted from the introduction\r\nof machinery, the use of power, and the factory system. Had this been\r\nthe case we should not, upon our hypothesis, have expected to find\r\nTrade Unions at an earlier date than factories, or in industries\r\nuntransformed by machinery. The fact that the earliest durable\r\ncombinations of wage-earners in England precede the factory system\r\nby a whole century, and occur in trades carried on exclusively by\r\nhand labour, reminds us that the creation of a class of lifelong\r\nwage-servants came about in more than one way.\r\n\r\nWe may note, to begin with, the very old institution of the printers’\r\n“chapel,” with its “father” and “clerk,” an informal association among\r\nthe compositors of a particular establishment for the discussion and\r\nregulation, not only of their own workshop conditions, but also of\r\ntheir relations with the employer, who must, in early days, have been a\r\nman of superior education, with an outlook much wider than that of his\r\njourneymen.\r\n\r\nThe “chapel” may possibly be nearly as old as the introduction of\r\nprinting into this country.[42] We have no evidence as to the date\r\nat which the “chapels” of different printing offices entered into\r\ncommunication with each other in London, so as to form a Trade\r\nUnion. But already in 1666 we have _The Case and Proposals of\r\nthe Free Journeymen Printers in and about London_, in which they\r\ncomplain of the multiplication of apprentices and the prevalence of\r\n“turnovers”--grievances which vexed every compositors’ Trade Union\r\nthroughout the nineteenth century.[43] Whether the “Free Journeymen\r\nPrinters” managed to continue in existence as a Trade Union is\r\nuncertain. We have found no actual evidence of any other combination\r\namong compositors than the “chapel” earlier than the eighteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nOne of the earliest proven cases of continuous association\r\namong journeymen is that of the hatters (or feltmakers), whose\r\ncombination--now the Journeymen Hatters’ Trade Union of Great Britain\r\nand Ireland--may perhaps claim to trace its ancestry from 1667, the\r\nvery year in which the Feltmakers’ Company, consisting of their\r\nemployers, obtained a charter from Charles II. Within a few months\r\nthe journeymen in the various London workshops--each of which had\r\napparently a workshop organisation somewhat resembling the printers’\r\n“chapel”--had combined to present a petition to the Court of Aldermen\r\nagainst the Master, Wardens and Assistants of the Company. The Court\r\nof Aldermen decided that, in order “that the journeymen may not by\r\ncombination or otherwise excessively at their pleasure raise their\r\nwages,” a piecework list is to be annually settled and presented\r\nfor enactment by the Court of Aldermen. The journeymen seem to\r\nhave co-operated with the employers in presenting this list, and\r\nin preventing the employment of non-freemen. The rates fixed did\r\nnot, however, always satisfy the journeymen, especially when the\r\nemployers were successful in getting them lowered; and in 1696 we\r\nread of a deputation appearing before the Court to declare that they\r\nhad resolved among themselves not to accept any less wages than they\r\nhad formerly received, and to ask for a revision of the order. They\r\nhad, according to the masters’ statement, not confined themselves to\r\npeaceful resolutions, but had made an example of a journeyman who had\r\nremained at work at the reduced rates. “They stirred up the apprentices\r\nto seize upon him as he was working, to tie him in a wheelbarrow,\r\nand in a tumultuous and riotous manner to drive him through all the\r\nconsiderable places in London and Southwark.” It was alleged that the\r\nmen were organised in “clubs,” which “raised several sums of money\r\nfor the abetting and supporting such of them who should desert their\r\nmasters’ service.” In 1697 the employers introduced the “character\r\nnote” or “leaving certificate,” the Company enacting that no master\r\nshould employ a journeyman who did not bring with him a certificate\r\nfrom his previous employer. Successive prosecutions of journeymen took\r\nplace for refusing to work at the lawful rates, but the workmen seem\r\nto have had good legal advice, and to have defended themselves with\r\nskill. On one occasion they pleaded guilty, and promised amendment\r\nand the abandonment of their combination, whereupon the prosecution\r\nwas withdrawn. On another occasion they got the case removed by writ\r\nof _certiorari_ from the Lord Mayor’s session to the Assizes, where\r\nLord Chief Justice Holt referred the dispute to arbitration. The\r\naward of June 1699 was a virtual victory for the journeymen, after a\r\nthree years’ struggle, as it gave them an increase of rates, with a\r\nstoppage of all legal proceedings.[44] That the London Trade Clubs\r\nof the journeymen hatters, or at any rate their several workshop\r\norganisations, maintained a continuous existence we need not doubt;\r\nthough we do not hear of them again until 1771, when they seem to have\r\nestablished a national federation of the local trade clubs existing\r\nin more than a dozen provincial towns with those of Southwark and\r\nthe West End of London, very largely for the purpose of maintaining\r\nand enforcing the statutory limitation of apprentices. In 1775 this\r\nfederation appears to have been strong enough, not only to obtain\r\nincreased rates of wages, but also the exclusive employment of\r\n“clubmen.” There were “congresses” of the hatters in 1772, 1775,\r\nand 1777, held in London for the adoption of “bye-laws” for the\r\nwhole trade; but we believe that these “congresses” were attended by\r\ndelegates from the workshops in and near London only. It is clear\r\nthat similar organisations existed in the other towns in which the\r\ntrade was carried on. The members who were unemployed “tramped” from\r\ntown to town, and regulations for their relief were framed. A weekly\r\ncontribution of 2d. appears to have been paid by each member. The\r\nemployers successfully petitioned Parliament in 1777 for a repeal\r\nof the old limitation of apprentices and a renewed prohibition of\r\ncombination.[45]\r\n\r\nMore definite evidence is afforded by the development of the tailoring\r\ntrade. In tailoring for rich customers the master craftsmen appear at\r\nthe very beginning of the eighteenth century to have been recruited\r\nfrom the comparatively small number of journeymen who acquired the\r\nspecially skilled part of the business--namely, the cutting-out.[46]\r\n“The tailor,” says an eighteenth-century manual for the young\r\ntradesman, “ought to have a quick eye to steal the cut of a sleeve,\r\nthe pattern of a flap, or the shape of a good trimming at a glance,\r\n... in the passing of a chariot, or in the space between the door and\r\na coach.” There grew up accordingly a class of mere sewers, “not one\r\nin ten” knowing “how to cut out a pair of breeches: they are employed\r\nonly to sew the seam, to cast the buttonholes, and prepare the work\r\nfor the finisher.... Generally as poor as rats, the House of Call runs\r\naway with all their earnings, and keeps them constantly in debt and\r\nwant.”[47]\r\n\r\nThis differentiation was promoted by the increasing need of capital\r\nfor successfully beginning business in the better quarters of the\r\nmetropolis. Already in 1681 the “shop-keeping tailor” was deplored as\r\na new and objectionable feature, “for many remember when there were\r\nno new garments sold in London (in shops) as now there are.”[48] The\r\n“accustomed tailor,” or working craftsman, making up the customer’s\r\nown cloth, objected to “taylers being sales-men,” paying high rents\r\nfor shops in fashionable neighbourhoods, giving long credit to their\r\naristocratic clients, and each employing, in his own workshops, dozens\r\nor even scores of journeymen, who were recruited from the houses of\r\ncall in times of pressure, and ruthlessly turned adrift when the season\r\nwas over. And although it remained possible in the reign of King\r\nWilliam the Third, as it still is in that of King George the Fifth, to\r\nstart business in a back street as an independent master tailor with\r\nno more capital or skill than the average journeyman could command,\r\nyet the making of the fine clothes worn by the Court and the gentry\r\ndemanded, then as now, a capital and a skill which put this extensive\r\nand lucrative trade altogether out of the reach of the thousands of\r\njourneymen whom it employed. Thus we find that at the very beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century the typical journeyman tailor in London and\r\nWestminster had become a lifelong wage-earner. It is not surprising,\r\ntherefore, that one of the earliest instances of permanent Trade\r\nUnionism that we have been able to discover occurs in this trade. The\r\nmaster tailors in 1720 complain to Parliament that “the Journeymen\r\nTaylors in and about the Cities of London and Westminster, to the\r\nnumber of seven thousand and upwards, have lately entered into a\r\ncombination to raise their wages and leave off working an hour sooner\r\nthan they used to do; and for the better carrying on their design\r\nhave subscribed their respective names in books prepared for that\r\npurpose, at the several houses of call or resort (being publick-houses\r\nin and about London and Westminster) which they use; and collect\r\nseveral considerable sums of money to defend any prosecutions against\r\nthem.”[49] Parliament listened to the masters’ complaint, and passed\r\nthe Act 7, Geo. I. st. 1, c. 13, restraining both the giving and the\r\ntaking of wages in excess of a stated maximum, all combinations being\r\nprohibited. From that time forth the journeymen tailors of London\r\nand Westminster have remained in effective though sometimes informal\r\ncombination, the organisation centring round the fifteen or twenty\r\n“houses of call,” being the public-houses to which it was customary for\r\nthe workmen to resort, and at which the employers sought any additional\r\nmen whom they wished to engage. In 1744 the Privy Council was set in\r\nmotion against their refusal to obey the Act of 1720.[50] In 1750-51\r\nthey invoked the assistance of the Middlesex Justices, and obtained\r\nan order requiring the masters to pay certain rates. In 1767 further\r\nlegislation was, in spite of their eloquent protests, obtained against\r\nthem.[51] In 1810 a master declared before a Select Committee that\r\ntheir combination had existed for over a century.[52]\r\n\r\nAn equally early instance of permanent trade combination is the\r\nwoollen manufacture of the West of England. Here the rise of a class\r\nof lifelong wage-earners took a form altogether different from that\r\nin the London tailoring trade, but it produced the same result of\r\ncombinations among the workers. The “wealthy clothiers” of Somerset,\r\nGloucestershire, and Devon, who during the sixteenth century had\r\n“mightily increased in fame and riches, their houses frequented like\r\nkings’ courts,”[53] provided and owned the material of the industry\r\nthroughout the whole manufacturing process, but employed a separate\r\nclass of operatives at each stage. Buying the wool at one of the market\r\ntowns, the capitalist clothier gave this to one set of hand-workers to\r\nbe carded and spun into yarn in the village households. The yarn was\r\npassed on to another set--the handloom weavers--to be made into cloth\r\nin their cottages. The cloth was then “fulled” at the capitalist’s own\r\nmill (usually a water-mill) and again given out to be “dressed” by a\r\nnew set of hand-workers, after which it was ready to be packed in the\r\nwarehouse, and dispatched to Bristol or London for shipment or sale.\r\nIn this case, as in that of the tailors, the operatives still retained\r\nthe ownership of the tools of their particular processes, but it was\r\npractically impossible for them to acquire either the capital or the\r\ncommercial knowledge necessary for the success of so highly organised\r\nan industry, and we accordingly find them entering into extensive\r\ncombinations from the closing years of the seventeenth century. Already\r\nin 1675 the journeymen clothworkers of London combined to petition the\r\nCourt of the Clothworkers’ Company against the engagement of workmen\r\nfrom the country. In 1682 we hear of them taking advantage of an\r\nextensive shipping order to refuse, in concert, to work under 12s.\r\nper week. But it is not clear whether any lasting association then\r\nresulted.[54] In the West of England the ephemeral revolts of the early\r\npart of the seventeenth century seem to have developed into lasting\r\ncombinations by the end of that century. We hear of them at Tiverton\r\nas early as 1700.[55] In 1717 the Journals of the House of Commons\r\ncontain evidence of the existence of a widespread combination of the\r\nwoollen-workers in Devonshire and Somerset. The Mayor and Corporation\r\nof Bradninch complain “that for some years past the woolcombers and\r\nweavers in those parts have been confederating how to incorporate\r\nthemselves into a club: and have to the number of some thousands in\r\nthis county, in a very riotous and tumultuous manner, exacted tribute\r\nfrom many.”[56] The House of Commons apparently thought the evil\r\ncould be met by Royal Authority and requested the King to issue a\r\nProclamation. Accordingly on February 4, 1718, a Royal Proclamation was\r\nissued against these “lawless clubs and societies which had illegally\r\npresumed to use a common seal, and to act as Bodies Corporate, by\r\nmaking and unlawfully conspiring to execute certain By-laws or Orders,\r\nwhereby they pretend to determine who had a right to the Trade, what\r\nand how many Apprentices and Journeymen each man should keep at once,\r\ntogether with the prices of all their manufactures, and the manner\r\nand materials of which they should be wrought.”[57] This kingly\r\nfulmination, which was read at the Royal Exchange, failed to effect its\r\npurpose, for the Journals of the House of Commons for 1723 and 1725\r\ncontain frequent complaints of the continuance of the combinations,[58]\r\nwhich are constantly heard of throughout the whole of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, dying away only on the supersession of the male by the\r\nfemale weaver at the beginning of the nineteenth century, not to be\r\neffectively revived until the beginning of the twentieth.\r\n\r\nThis early development of trade combinations in the West of England\r\nstands in striking contrast with their absence in the same industry\r\nwhere pursued, as in Yorkshire, on the so-called “Domestic System.”\r\nThe Yorkshire weaver was a small master craftsman of the old type,\r\nhimself buying and owning the raw material, and once or twice a week\r\nselling his cloth in the markets of Leeds or Wakefield, to which, we\r\nare told by Defoe in 1724, “few clothiers bring more than one piece.”\r\n“Almost at every house,” he writes of the country near Halifax, “there\r\nwas a Tenter, and almost on every Tenter a piece of cloth, or kersey,\r\nor shalloon, ... at every considerable house was a manufactory; ...\r\nthen, as every clothier must keep a horse, perhaps two, to fetch and\r\ncarry for the use of his manufacture, viz., to fetch home his wool and\r\nhis provisions from the market, to carry his yarn to the spinners,\r\nhis manufacture to the fulling mill, and when finished, to the market\r\nto be sold, and the like; so every manufacturer generally keeps a cow\r\nor two or more, for his family, and this employs the two or three or\r\nfour pieces of enclosed land about his house, for they scarce sow corn\r\nenough for their cocks and hens.”[59] Not until the Yorkshire cloth\r\ndealers began, about 1794, to establish factories on a large scale\r\ndo we find any Trade Unions, and then journeymen and small masters\r\nstruggled with one accord to resist the new form of capitalist industry\r\nwhich was beginning to deprive them of their control over the product\r\nof their labour.\r\n\r\nThe worsted industry appears everywhere to have been carried on rather\r\nlike the woollen manufactures of the West of England than the same\r\nindustry in Yorkshire. The woolcomber frequently owned the inexpensive\r\nhand-combs and pots with which he worked. But the woolcombers, like\r\nthe weavers of the West of England, formed but one of several classes\r\nof workers for whose employment both capital and commercial knowledge\r\nwas indispensable. We hear, already in 1674, of an attempt by the\r\nLeicester woolcombers to “form a company,”[60] though with what success\r\nwe know not. In 1741 it was remarked that the woolcombers had “for a\r\nnumber of years past erected themselves into a sort of corporation\r\n(though without a charter); their first pretence was to take care\r\nof their poor brethren that should fall sick, or be out of work;\r\nand this was done by meeting once or twice a week, and each of them\r\ncontributing 2d. or 3d. towards the box to make a bank, and when they\r\nbecame a little formidable they gave laws to their masters, as also to\r\nthemselves--viz., That no man should comb wool under 2s. per dozen;\r\nthat no master should employ any comber that was not of their club:\r\nif he did they agreed one and all not to work for him; and if he had\r\nemployed twenty they all of them turned out, and oftentimes were not\r\nsatisfied with that, but would abuse the honest man that would labour,\r\nand in a riotous manner beat him, break his comb-pots, and destroy his\r\nworking tools; they further support one another in so much that they\r\nare become one society throughout the kingdom. And that they may keep\r\nup their price to encourage idleness rather than labour, if any one of\r\ntheir club is out of work, they give him a ticket and money to seek for\r\nwork at the next town where a box club is, where he is also subsisted,\r\nsuffered to live a certain time with them, and then used as before; by\r\nwhich means he can travel the kingdom round, be caressed at each club,\r\nand not spend a farthing of his own or strike one stroke of work. This\r\nhath been imitated by the weavers also, though not carried through the\r\nkingdom, but confined to the places where they work.”[61] The surviving\r\nmembers of the Old Amicable Society of Woolstaplers retain a tradition\r\nof local trade clubs dating from the very beginning of the eighteenth\r\ncentury, and of their forming a federal union in 1785. Old members\r\nof the United Journeymen Curriers’ Society have seen circulars and\r\ntramping cards, showing that a similar tramping federation existed in\r\ntheir trade from the middle of the century.[62]\r\n\r\nIn other cases the expensive nature of the raw material or the tools\r\naided the creation of a separate class. The Spitalfields silk-weavers,\r\nwhom we find forming a permanent organisation in 1773, could never have\r\nowned the costly silks they wove.[63] The gold-beaters, whose union\r\ndates at any rate from 1777, were similarly debarred from owning the\r\nmaterial.\r\n\r\nAnother remarkable instance of combination prior to the introduction of\r\nmechanical power and the factory system is that of the “stockingers,”\r\nthe hosiery workers, or framework knitters, described by Dr. Brentano.\r\nFrom the very beginning of the use of the stocking-frame, in the\r\nearly part of the seventeenth century, servants appear to have been\r\nset to work upon frames owned by capitalists, though the bulk of the\r\ntrade was in the hands of men who worked upon their own frames as\r\nindependent producers. The competition of these embryo factories was\r\nseverely felt by the domestic framework knitter, and on the final\r\nbreakdown, in 1753, of the legal limitation of apprentices, it became\r\ndisastrous. There grew up a “ruinous practice of parishes giving\r\npremiums to manufacturers for employing their poor,” and this flooding\r\nof the labour market with subsidised child labour reduced the typical\r\nframework knitter to a state of destitution. Though he continued to\r\nwork in his cottage, he rapidly lost the ownership of his frame, and a\r\nsystem arose under which the frames were hired at a rent, either from\r\na small capitalist frame-owner, or from the manufacturer by whom the\r\nwork was given out. The operative was thus deprived, not only of the\r\nownership of the product, but also of the instruments of his labour.\r\nHence, although from the very beginning of the eighteenth century\r\nthere were ephemeral combinations among the framework knitters, in\r\nwhich masters and men often joined, it was not until 1780, when the\r\nrenting of frames had become general, that a durable Trade Union of\r\nwage-earners arose.[64]\r\n\r\nThe development of the industrial organisation of the cutlery\r\ntrades affords another example of this evolution. At the date of\r\nthe establishment in Sheffield of the Cutlers’ Company (1624) the\r\ntypical craftsman was himself the owner of his “wheel” and other\r\ninstruments, and a strict limitation of apprentices was maintained. By\r\n1791, when the masters obtained from Parliament a formal ratification\r\nof the prevalent relaxation in the customary restrictions as to\r\napprentices, we find this system largely replaced by something very\r\nlike the present order of things, in which the typical Sheffield\r\noperative works with material given out by the manufacturer, upon\r\nwheels rented either from the latter or from a landlord supplying\r\npower. It is no mere coincidence that in the year 1790 the Sheffield\r\nemployers found themselves obliged to take concerted action against\r\nthe “scissor-grinders and other workmen who have entered into unlawful\r\ncombinations to raise the price of labour.”[65]\r\n\r\nThe shipwrights of Liverpool, and probably those of other shipbuilding\r\nports, were combined in trade benefit clubs early in the eighteenth\r\ncentury. At Liverpool, where this society had very successfully\r\nmaintained the customary limitation of apprentices, the members were\r\nall freemen of the municipal corporation, and as such entitled to the\r\nParliamentary franchise. As a result the shipwrights’ organisation\r\nbecame intensely political, by which was meant chiefly the negotiation\r\nof the sale of its members’ votes. At the election of 1790, when Whigs\r\nand Tories compromised in order to avoid the expense of a contest, it\r\nwas the Shipwrights’ Society, then at the zenith of its power, which\r\ninsisted on forcing a contest by nominating its own candidate, and, in\r\nthe end, actually put him at the head of the poll. The society, which\r\nhad a contribution in 1824 of fifteen pence per month, and had built\r\nalmshouses for its old members, is reputed to have been at one time\r\nso powerful that any employer who refused to obey its rules found his\r\nbusiness absolutely brought to a standstill.[66]\r\n\r\nBut the cardinal example of the conception of Trade Unionism with\r\nthe divorce of the worker from the instruments of production is seen\r\nin the rapid rise of trade combinations on the introduction of the\r\nfactory system. We have already noticed that Trade Unions in Yorkshire\r\nbegan with the erection of factories and the use of power. When, in\r\n1794, the clothiers of the West Riding failed to prevent the Leeds\r\nmerchants from establishing large factories, “wherein it is intended\r\nto employ a great number of persons now working at their own homes,”\r\nthe journeymen took the matter into their own hands, and founded “the\r\nClothiers’ Community,” or “Brief Institution,” professedly to gather\r\n“briefs” or levies for the relief of the sick, and to carry on a\r\nParliamentary agitation for hampering the factory owners by a legal\r\nlimitation of apprentices. “It appears,” reports the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee of 1806, “that there has existed for some time an institution\r\nor society among the woollen manufacturers, consisting chiefly of\r\nclothworkers. In each of the principal manufacturing towns there\r\nappears to be a society, composed of deputies chosen from the several\r\nshops of workmen, from each of which town societies one or more\r\ndeputies are chosen to form what is called the central committee,\r\nwhich meets, as occasion requires, at some place suitable to the local\r\nconvenience of all parties. The powers of the central committee appear\r\nto pervade the whole institution; and any determination or measure\r\nwhich it may adopt may be communicated with ease throughout the whole\r\nbody of manufacturers. Every workman, on his becoming a member of the\r\nsociety, receives a certain card or ticket, on which is an emblematical\r\nengraving--the same, the Committee are assured, both in the North\r\nand the West of England--that by producing his ticket he may at once\r\nshow he belongs to the society. The same rules and regulations appear\r\nto be in force throughout the whole district, and there is the utmost\r\nreason to believe that no clothworker would be suffered to carry on\r\nhis trade, otherwise than in solitude, who should refuse to submit\r\nto the obligations and rules of the society.”[67] The transformation\r\nof cotton-spinning into a factory industry, which may be said to\r\nhave taken place round about the year 1780, was equally accompanied\r\nby the growth of Trade Unionism. The so-called benefit clubs of the\r\nOldham operatives, which we know to have existed from 1792, and those\r\nof Stockport, of which we hear in 1796, were the forerunners of that\r\nnetwork of spinners’ societies throughout the northern counties and\r\nScotland which rose into notoriety in the great strikes of the next\r\nthirty years.[68]\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand how the massing together in factories of\r\nregiments of men all engaged in the same trade facilitated and\r\npromoted the formation of journeymen’s trade societies. But with the\r\ncotton-spinners, as with the tailors, the rise of permanent trade\r\ncombinations is to be ascribed, in a final analysis, to the definite\r\nseparation between the functions of the capitalist _entrepreneur_ and\r\nthe manual worker--between, that is to say, the direction of industrial\r\noperations and their execution. It has, indeed, become a commonplace of\r\nmodern Trade Unionism that only in those industries in which the worker\r\nhas ceased to be concerned in the profits of buying and selling--that\r\ninseparable characteristic of the ownership and management of the\r\nmeans of production--can effective and stable trade organisations be\r\nestablished.\r\n\r\nThe positive proofs of this historical dependence of Trade Unionism\r\nupon the divorce of the worker from the ownership of the means of\r\nproduction are complemented by the absence of any permanent trade\r\ncombinations in industries in which the divorce had not taken place.\r\nThe degradation of the Standard of Life of the skilled manual worker on\r\nthe break-up of the mediæval system occurred in all sorts of trades,\r\nwhether the operative retained his ownership of the means of production\r\nor not, but Trade Unionism followed only where the change took the form\r\nof a divorce between capital and labour. The Corporation of Pinmakers\r\nof London are found petitioning Parliament towards the end of the\r\nseventeenth century or beginning of the eighteenth, as follows:\r\n\r\n“This company consists for the most part of poor and indigent people,\r\nwho have neither credit nor mony to purchase wyre of the merchant\r\nat the best hand, but are forced for want thereof to buy only small\r\nparcels of the second or third buyer as they have occasion to use it,\r\nand to sell off the pins they make of the same from week to week,\r\nas soon as they are made, for ready money to feed themselves, their\r\nwives and children, whom they are constrained to imploy to go up and\r\ndown every Saturday night from shop to shop to offer their pins to\r\nsale, otherwise cannot have money to buy bread. And these are daily so\r\nexceedingly multiplyed and encreased by reason of the unlimited number\r\nof apprentices that some few covetous-minded members of the company\r\n(who have considerable stocks) do constantly imploy and keep....\r\nThe persons that buy the pins from the maker to sell again to other\r\nretailing shopkeepers, taking advantage of this necessity of the poor\r\nworkmen (who are always forced to sell for ready mony, or otherwise\r\ncannot subsist), have by degrees so beaten down the price of pins that\r\nthe workman is not able to live of his work, ... and betake themselves\r\nto be porters, tankard bearers, and other day labourers, ... and many\r\nof their children do daily become parish charges.”[69] And the glovers\r\ncomplain at the same period that “they are generally so poor that they\r\nare supplied with leather upon credit, not being able to pay for that\r\nor their work-folk’s wages till they have sold the gloves.”[70]\r\n\r\nNow, although these pinmakers and glovers, and other trades in like\r\ncondition, fully recognised the need for some protection of their\r\nStandard of Life, we do not find any trace of Trade Unionism among\r\nthem. Selling as they did, not their labour alone, but also its\r\nproduct, their only resource was legislative protection of the price of\r\ntheir wares.[71] In short, in those industries in which the cleavage\r\nbetween capitalist and artisan, manager and manual labourer, was not\r\nyet complete, the old gild policy of commercial monopoly was resorted\r\nto as the only expedient for protecting the Standard of Life of the\r\nproducer.\r\n\r\nWe do not contend that the divorce supplies, in itself, a complete\r\nexplanation of the origin of Trade Unions. At all times in the\r\nhistory of English industry there have existed large classes of\r\nworkers as much debarred from becoming the directors of their own\r\nindustry as the eighteenth-century tailor or woolcomber, or as the\r\nmodern cotton-spinner or miner. Besides the semi-servile workers on\r\nthe land or in the mines, it is certain that there were in the towns\r\na considerable class of unskilled labourers, excluded, through lack\r\nof apprenticeship, from any participation in the gild.[72] By the\r\neighteenth century, at any rate, the numbers of this class must\r\nhave been largely swollen, by the increased demand for common labour\r\ninvolved in the growth of the transport trade, the extensive building\r\noperations, etc. But it is not among the farm servants, miners, or\r\ngeneral labourers, ill-paid and ill-treated as these often were,\r\nthat the early Trade Unions arose. We do not even hear of ephemeral\r\ncombinations among them, and only very occasionally of transient\r\nstrikes.[73] The formation of independent associations to resist the\r\nwill of employers requires the possession of a certain degree of\r\npersonal independence and strength of character. Thus we find the\r\nearliest Trade Unions arising among journeymen whose skill and Standard\r\nof Life had been for centuries encouraged and protected by legal or\r\ncustomary regulations as to apprenticeship, and by the limitation\r\nof their numbers which the high premiums and other conditions must\r\nhave involved. It is often assumed that Trade Unionism arose as a\r\nprotest against intolerable industrial oppression. This was not so.\r\nThe first half of the eighteenth century was certainly not a period of\r\nexceptional distress. For fifty years from 1710 there was an almost\r\nconstant succession of good harvests, the price of wheat remaining\r\nunusually low. The tailors of London and Westminster united, at the\r\nvery beginning of the eighteenth century, not to resist any reduction\r\nof their customary earnings, but to wring from their employers better\r\nwages and shorter hours of labour. The few survivors of the hand\r\nwoolcombers still cherish the tradition of the eighteenth century,\r\nwhen they styled themselves “gentlemen woolcombers,” refused to\r\ndrink with other operatives, and were strong enough, as we have seen,\r\nto give “laws to their masters.”[74] The very superior millwrights,\r\nwhose exclusive trade clubs preceded any general organisation of the\r\nengineering trade, had for “their everyday garb” a “long frock coat and\r\ntall hat.”[75] And the curriers, hatters, woolstaplers, shipwrights,\r\nbrush-makers, basketmakers, and calico-printers, who furnish prominent\r\ninstances of eighteenth-century Trade Unionism, all earned relatively\r\nhigh wages, and long maintained a very effectual resistance to the\r\nencroachments of their employers.\r\n\r\nIt appears to us from these facts that Trade Unionism would have been\r\na feature of English industry, even without the steam-engine and the\r\nfactory system. Whether the association of superior workmen which arose\r\nin the early part of the century would, in such an event, ever have\r\ndeveloped into a Trade Union Movement is another matter. The typical\r\n“trade club” of the town artisan of this time was an isolated “ring”\r\nof highly skilled journeymen, who were even more decisively marked\r\noff from the mass of the manual workers than from the small class of\r\ncapitalist employers. The customary enforcement of the apprenticeship\r\nprescribed by the Elizabethan statutes, and the high premiums often\r\nexacted from parents not belonging to the trade, long maintained a\r\nvirtual monopoly of the better-paid handicrafts in the hands of an\r\nalmost hereditary caste of “tradesmen” in whose ranks the employers\r\nthemselves had for the most part served their apprenticeship. Enjoying,\r\nas they did, this legal or customary protection, they found their\r\ntrade clubs of use mainly for the provision of friendly benefits, and\r\nfor “higgling” with their masters for better terms. We find little\r\ntrace among such trade clubs of that sense of solidarity between the\r\nmanual workers of different trades which afterwards became so marked\r\na feature of the Trade Union Movement. Their occasional disputes with\r\ntheir employers resembled rather family differences than conflicts\r\nbetween distinct social classes. They exhibit more tendency to “stand\r\nin” with their masters against the community, or to back them against\r\nrivals or interlopers, than to join their fellow-workers of other\r\ntrades in an attack upon the capitalist class. In short, we have\r\nindustrial society still divided vertically trade by trade, instead of\r\nhorizontally between employers and wage-earners. This latter cleavage\r\nit is which has transformed the Trade Unionism of petty groups of\r\nskilled workmen into the modern Trade Union Movement.[76]\r\n\r\nThe pioneers of the Trade Union Movement were not the trade clubs\r\nof the town artisans, but the extensive combinations of the West of\r\nEngland woollen-workers and the Midland framework knitters. It was\r\nthese associations that initiated what afterwards became the common\r\npurpose of nearly all eighteenth-century combinations--the appeal to\r\nthe Government and the House of Commons to save the wage-earners from\r\nthe new policy of buying labour, like the raw material of manufacture,\r\nin the cheapest market. The rapidly changing processes and widening\r\nmarkets of English industry seemed to demand the sweeping away of\r\nall restrictions on the supply and employment of labour, a process\r\nwhich involved the levelling of all classes of wage-earners to their\r\n“natural wages.” The first to feel the encroachment on their customary\r\nearnings were the woollen-workers employed by the capitalist clothiers\r\nof the Western counties. As the century advances we find trade after\r\ntrade taking up the agitation against the new conditions, and such\r\nold-established clubs as the hatters and the woolcombers joining the\r\ngeneral movement as soon as their own industries are menaced. To the\r\nskilled craftsman in the towns the new policy was brought home by the\r\nrepeal of the regulations which protected his trade against an influx\r\nof pauper labour. His defence was to ask for the enforcement of the\r\nlaw relating to apprenticeship.[77] This would not have helped the\r\noperative in the staple textile industries. To him the new order took\r\nthe form of constantly declining piecework rates. What he demanded,\r\ntherefore, was the fixing of the “convenient proportion of wages”\r\ncontemplated by Elizabethan legislation. But, whether craftsmen or\r\nfactory operatives, the wage-earners turned, for the maintenance of\r\ntheir Standard of Life, to that protection by the law upon which they\r\nhad been taught to rely. So long as each section of workers believed in\r\nthe intention of the governing class to protect their trade from the\r\nresults of unrestricted competition no community of interest arose. It\r\nwas a change of industrial policy on the part of the Government that\r\nbrought all trades into line, and for the first time produced what can\r\nproperly be called a Trade Union Movement. In order, therefore, to make\r\nthis movement fully intelligible, we must now retrace our steps, and\r\nfollow the political history of industry in the eighteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe dominant industrial policy of the sixteenth century was the\r\nestablishment of some regulating authority to perform, for the trade\r\nof the time, the services formerly rendered by the Craft Gilds.\r\nWhen, for instance, in the middle of the century the weavers found\r\ntheir customary earnings dwindling, they managed so far to combine\r\nas to make their voice heard at Westminster. In 1555 we find them\r\ncomplaining “that the rich and wealthy clothiers do many ways oppress\r\nthem” by putting unapprenticed men to work on the capitalists’ own\r\nlooms, by letting out looms at rents, and “some also by giving much\r\nless wages and hire for the weaving and workmanship of clothes than\r\nin times past they did.”[78] To the Parliament of these days it\r\nseemed right and natural that the oppressed wage-earners should turn\r\nto the legislature to protect them against the cutting down of their\r\nearnings by the competing capitalists. The statutes of 1552 and 1555\r\nforbid the use of the gig-mill, restrict the number of looms that one\r\nperson may own to two in towns and one in the country, and absolutely\r\nprohibit the letting-out of looms for hire or rent. In 1563, indeed,\r\nParliament expressly charged itself with securing to all wage-earners\r\na “convenient” livelihood. The old laws fixing a maximum wage could\r\nnot, in face of the enormous rise of prices, be put in force “without\r\nthe great grief and burden of the poor labourer and hired man.”\r\nCircumstances were changing too fast for any rigid rule. But by the\r\ncelebrated “Statute of Apprentices” the statesmen of the time contrived\r\narrangements which would, as they hoped, “yield unto the hired person,\r\nboth in the time of scarcity and in the time of plenty, a convenient\r\nproportion of wages.” Every year the justices of each locality were\r\nto meet, “and calling unto them such discreet and grave persons ...\r\nas they shall think meet, and conferring together respecting the\r\nplenty or scarcity of the time,” were to fix the wages of practically\r\nevery kind of labour,[79] their decisions being enforceable by heavy\r\npenalties. Stringent regulations as to the necessity of apprenticeship,\r\nthe length of its term, and the number of apprentices to be taken by\r\neach employer, received the confirmation of law. The typical ordinances\r\nof the mediæval gild were, in fact, enacted in minute detail in a\r\ncomprehensive general statute applying to the greater part of the\r\nindustry of the period.\r\n\r\nWe need not discuss the very debatable question whether this celebrated\r\nlaw was or was not advantageous to the labouring folk of the time,\r\nor whether and to what extent its provisions were actually put in\r\nforce.[80] But codifying and enacting as it did the fundamental\r\nprinciples of the mediæval social order, we can scarcely be surprised\r\nthat its adoption by Parliament confirmed the working man in the once\r\nuniversal belief in the essential justice and good policy securing by\r\nappropriate legislation “the getting of a competent livelihood” by\r\nall those concerned in industry.[81] Exactly the same view prevailed\r\nat the beginning of the eighteenth century. We again find the newly\r\nestablished associations of the operatives appealing to the King,\r\nto the House of Commons, or to Quarter Sessions against the beating\r\ndown of their wages by their employers. For the first half of the\r\ncentury the governing classes continued to act on the assumption that\r\nthe industrious mechanic had a right to the customary earnings of\r\nhis trade. Thus in 1726 the weavers of Wilts and Somerset combine to\r\npetition the King against the harshness and fraud of their employers\r\nthe clothiers, with the result that a Committee of the Privy Council\r\ninvestigates their grievances, and draws up “Articles of Agreement”\r\nfor the settlement of the matters in dispute,[82] admonishing the\r\nweavers “for the future” not to attempt to help themselves by unlawful\r\ncombinations, but always “to lay their grievances in a regular way\r\nbefore His Majesty, who would be always ready to grant them relief\r\nsuitable to the justice of their case.”[83] More often the operatives\r\nappealed to the House of Commons. In 1719 the “broad and narrow\r\nweavers” of Stroud and places round, petitioned Parliament to put down\r\nthe tyrannical capitalist clothiers by enforcing the “Act touching\r\nWeavers” of 1555.[84] In 1728 the Gloucestershire operatives appealed\r\nto the local justices of the peace, and induced them, in spite of\r\nprotests from the master clothiers, and apparently for the first time,\r\nto fix a liberal scale of wages for the weavers of the country.[85]\r\nTwenty years later the operatives obtained from Parliament a special\r\nprohibition of truck.[86] Finally, in 1756 they persuaded the House of\r\nCommons to pass an Act[87] providing for the fixing of piecework prices\r\nby the justices, in order that the practice of cutting down rates and\r\nunderselling might be stopped. “A Table or Scheme for Rates of Wages”\r\nwas accordingly settled at Quarter Sessions, November 6, 1756, with\r\nwhich the operatives were fairly contented.[88]\r\n\r\nThe next few years saw a revolutionary change in the industrial\r\npolicy of the legislature which must have utterly bewildered the\r\noperatives. Within a generation the House of Commons exchanged its\r\npolicy of mediæval protection for one of “Administrative Nihilism.” The\r\nWoollen Cloth Weavers’ Act of 1756 had not been one year in force when\r\nParliament was assailed by numerous petitions and counter petitions.\r\nThe employers declared that the rates fixed by the justices were, in\r\nface of the growing competition of Yorkshire, absolutely impracticable.\r\nThe operatives, on the other hand, asked that the Act might be\r\nstrengthened in their favour. The clothiers asserted the advantages of\r\nfreedom of contract and unrestrained competition. The weavers received\r\nthe support of the landowners and gentry in claiming the maintenance by\r\nlaw of their customary earnings. The perplexed House of Commons wavered\r\nbetween the two. At first a Bill was ordered to be drawn strengthening\r\nthe existing law; but ultimately the clothiers were held to have proved\r\ntheir case.[89] The Act of 1756 was, in 1757, unconditionally repealed;\r\nand Parliament was now heading straight for _laisser-faire_.\r\n\r\nThe struggle over this Woollen Cloth Weavers’ Act of 1756 marks the\r\npassage from the old ideas to the new. When, in 1776, the weavers,\r\nspinners, scribblers, and other woollen operatives of Somerset\r\npetitioned against the evil that was being done to their accustomed\r\nlivelihood by the introduction of the spinning-jenny into Shepton\r\nMallet, the House of Commons, which had two centuries before absolutely\r\nprohibited the gig-mill, refused even to allow the petition to be\r\nreceived.[90]\r\n\r\nThe change of policy had already affected another trade. The London\r\nFramework Knitters’ Company, which had been incorporated in 1663 for\r\nthe express purpose of regulating the trade, found itself during\r\nthe first half of the eighteenth century in continual conflict with\r\nrecalcitrant masters who set its bye-laws at defiance. This long\r\nstruggle, in which the journeymen took vigorous action in support\r\nof the Company, was brought to an end in 1753 by an exhaustive\r\nParliamentary inquiry. The bye-laws of the Company, upon the\r\nenforcement of which the journeymen had rested all their hopes, were\r\nsolemnly declared to be “injurious and vexatious to the manufacturers,”\r\nwhilst the Company’s authority was pronounced to be “hurtful to the\r\ntrade.”[91] The total abandonment of all legal regulation of the trade\r\nled, after numerous transitory revolts, to the establishment in 1778\r\nof “The Stocking Makers’ Association for the Mutual Protection in the\r\nMidland Counties of England,” having for its objects the limitation of\r\napprentices, and the enactment of a fixed rate of wages. Dr. Brentano\r\nhas summarised the various attempts made by the operatives during the\r\nnext two years to secure the protection of the legislature.[92] Through\r\nthe influence of their Union a sympathetic member was returned for the\r\nborough of Nottingham. Investigation by a committee brought to light\r\na degree of “sweating” scarcely paralleled even by the worst modern\r\ninstances. A Bill for the fixing of wages had actually passed its\r\nsecond reading when the employers, whipping up all their friends in\r\nthe House, defeated it on the third reading--a rebuff to the workmen\r\nwhich led to serious riots at Nottingham, and thrust the unfortunate\r\nframework knitters back into despairing poverty.[93]\r\n\r\nBy this time the town craftsmen were also beginning to be menaced\r\nby the revolutionary proposals of their employers. The hatters, for\r\nexample, whose early combination we have already mentioned, had\r\nhitherto been protected by the strict limitation of the number of\r\napprentices prescribed by the Acts of 1566 and 1603, and enforced by\r\nthe Feltmakers’ Company. We gather from the employers’ complaints that\r\nthe journeymen’s organisation, which by this time extended to most of\r\nthe provincial towns in which hats were made, was aiming at a strict\r\nenforcement of the law limiting the number of apprentices which each\r\nmaster might take. This caused the leading master hatters to promote,\r\nin 1777, a Bill to remove the limitation. Against them was marshalled\r\nthe whole strength of the journeymen’s organisation. Petitions poured\r\nin from London, Burton, Bristol, Chester, Liverpool, Hexham, Derby, and\r\nother places, the “piecemaster hat or feltmakers and finishers” usually\r\njoining with the journeymen against the demand of the capitalist\r\nemployers. The men asserted that, even with the limitation, “except\r\nat brisk times many hundreds are obliged to go travelling up and down\r\nthe kingdom in search of employ.” But the House was impressed with the\r\nevidence and arguments of the large employers, and their Bill passed\r\ninto law.[94]\r\n\r\nThe action of the House of Commons on occasions like these was not\r\nas yet influenced by any conscious theory of freedom of contract.\r\nWhat happened was that, as each trade in turn felt the effect of\r\nthe new capitalist competition, the journeymen, and often also the\r\nsmaller employers, would petition for redress, usually demanding the\r\nprohibition of the new machines, the enforcement of a seven years’\r\napprenticeship, or the maintenance of the old limitation of the\r\nnumber of boys to be taught by each employer. The House would as\r\na rule appoint a Committee to investigate the complaint, with the\r\nfull intention of redressing the alleged grievance. But the large\r\nemployers would produce before that Committee an overwhelming array\r\nof evidence proving that without the new machinery the growing export\r\ntrade must be arrested; that the new processes could be learnt in a\r\nfew months instead of seven years; and that the restriction of the old\r\nmaster craftsmen to two or three apprentices apiece was out of the\r\nquestion with the new buyers of labour on a large scale. Confronted\r\nwith such a case as this for the masters even the most sympathetic\r\ncommittee seldom found it possible to endorse the proposals of the\r\nartisans. In fact, these proposals were impossible. The artisans had a\r\ngrievance--perhaps the worst that any class can have--the degradation\r\nof their standard of livelihood by circumstances which enormously\r\nincreased the productivity of their labour. But they mistook the\r\nremedy; and Parliament, though it saw the mistake, could devise nothing\r\nbetter. Common sense forced the Government to take the easy and\r\nobvious step of abolishing the mediæval regulations which industry had\r\noutgrown. But the problem of protecting the workers’ Standard of Life\r\nunder the new conditions was neither easy nor obvious, and it remained\r\nunsolved until the nineteenth century discovered the expedients of\r\nCollective Bargaining and Factory Legislation, developing, in the\r\ntwentieth century, into the fixing by law of a Minimum Wage. In the\r\nmeantime the workers were left to shift for themselves, the attitude\r\nof Parliament towards them being for the first years one of pure\r\nperplexity, quite untouched by the doctrine of freedom of contract.\r\n\r\nThat the House of Commons remained innocent of any general theory\r\nagainst legislative interference long after it had begun the work of\r\nsweeping away the mediæval regulations is proved by the famous case of\r\nthe Spitalfields silk-weavers, in which the old policy of industrial\r\nregulation was reverted to. In 1765 the Spitalfields weavers protested\r\nthat they were without employment, owing to the importation of foreign\r\nsilk. Assembling in crowds, they marched in processions to Westminster,\r\nheaded by bands and banners, and demanded the prohibition of the import\r\nof the foreign product. Riots occurred sufficiently serious to induce\r\nParliament to pass an Act in the terms desired;[95] but this experiment\r\nin Protection failed to maintain wages, and the riots were renewed\r\nin 1769. Finally Sir John Fielding, the well-known London police\r\nmagistrate, suggested to the London silkweavers that they should\r\nsecure their earnings by an Act.[96] Under the pressure of another\r\noutbreak of rioting in 1773, Parliament adopted this proposal, and\r\nempowered the justices to fix the rates of wages and to enforce their\r\nmaintenance. The effect of this enactment upon the men’s combination\r\nis significant. “A great man” had told the weavers, as one of them\r\nrelates, that the governing class “made laws, and we, the people,\r\nmust make legs to them.”[97] The ephemeral combination to obtain the\r\nAct became accordingly a permanent union to enforce it. From this\r\ntime forth we hear no more of strikes or riots among the Spitalfields\r\nweavers. Instead, we see arising a permanent machinery, designated the\r\n“Union,” for the representation, before the justices, of both masters\r\nand men, upon whose evidence the complicated lists of piecework rates\r\nare periodically settled. Clearly the Parliaments which passed the\r\nSpitalfields Acts of 1765 and 1773 had no conception of the political\r\nphilosophy of Adam Smith, whose _Wealth of Nations_, afterwards to be\r\naccepted as the English gospel of freedom of contract and “natural\r\nliberty,” was published in 1776. At the same time, so exceptional had\r\nsuch acts become, that when Adam Smith’s masterpiece came into the\r\nhands of the statesmen of the time, it must have seemed not so much a\r\nnovel view of industrial economics as the explicit generalisation of\r\npractical conclusions to which experience had already repeatedly driven\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of the century the governing classes, who had found\r\nin the new industrial policy a source of enormous pecuniary profit,\r\neagerly seized on the new economic theory as an intellectual and\r\nmoral justification of that policy. The abandonment of the operatives\r\nby the law, previously resorted to under pressure of circumstances,\r\nand, as we gather, not without some remorse, was now carried out on\r\nprinciple, with unflinching determination. When the handloom-weavers,\r\nearning little more than a third of the livelihood they had gained\r\nten years before, and unable to realise that the factory system would\r\nbe deliberately allowed to ruin them, made themselves heard in the\r\nHouse of Commons in 1808, a Committee reported against their proposal\r\nto fix a minimum rate of wages on the ground that it was “wholly\r\ninadmissible in principle, incapable of being reduced to practice by\r\nany means which can possibly be devised, and, if practicable, would be\r\nproductive of the most fatal consequences”; and “that the proposition\r\nrelative to the limiting the number of apprentices is also entirely\r\ninadmissible, and would, if adopted by the House, be attended with the\r\ngreatest injustice to the manufacturer as well as to the labourer.”[98]\r\nHere we have _laisser-faire_ fully established in Parliament as an\r\nauthoritative industrial doctrine of political economy, able to\r\novercome the great bulk of the evidence given before this Committee,\r\nwhich was decidedly in favour of the minimum wage. The House of Commons\r\nhad no lack of opportunities for educating itself on the question. The\r\nspecial misery caused by bad harvests and the prolonged war between\r\n1793 and 1815[99] brought a rush of appeals, especially from the newly\r\nestablished associations of cotton operatives. In the early years of\r\nthe present century petition after petition poured in from Lancashire\r\nand Glasgow, showing that the rates for weaving had steadily declined,\r\nand reiterating the old demands for a legally fixed scale of piecework\r\nrates and the limitation of apprentices. In 1795, and again in 1800,\r\nand once more in 1808, Bills fixing a minimum rate were introduced into\r\nthe House of Commons, sometimes meeting with considerable favour. The\r\nreport of the Committee of 1808, which took voluminous evidence on the\r\nsubject, has already been quoted. Petitions from the calico-printers\r\nfor a legal limitation of the number of apprentices, although warmly\r\nsupported by the Select Committee to which they were referred, met with\r\nthe same fate. Sheridan, indeed, was not convinced, and brought in a\r\nBill proposing, among other things, to limit the number of apprentices.\r\nBut Sir Robert Peel (the elder), whose own factories swarmed with boys,\r\nopposed it in the name of industrial freedom, and carried the House of\r\nCommons with him.[100]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the despairing operatives, baffled in their attempts to\r\nprocure fresh legislation, turned for aid to the existing law.\r\nUnrepealed statutes still enabled the justices in some trades to fix\r\nthe rate of wages, limited in others the number of apprentices; in\r\nothers, again, prohibited certain kinds of machinery, and forbade\r\nany but apprenticed men to exercise the trade. So completely had\r\nthese statutes fallen into disuse that their very existence was in\r\nmany instances unknown to the artisans. The West of England weavers,\r\nhowever, combined with those of Yorkshire in 1802 to employ an\r\nattorney, who took proceedings against employers for infringing the old\r\nlaws. The result was that Parliament hastily passed an Act suspending\r\nthese statutes, in order to put a stop to the prosecutions.[101] “At\r\na numerous meeting of the cordwainers of the City of New Sarum in\r\n1784,” says an old circular that we have seen, “it was unanimously\r\nresolved ... that a subscription be entered into for putting the law\r\nin force against infringements on the Trade,” but apparently without\r\nresult.[102] The Edinburgh compositors were more successful; on\r\nbeing refused an advance of wages, to correspond with the rise in the\r\ncost of living, they presented, February 28, 1804, a memorial to the\r\nCourt of Session, and obtained the celebrated “Interlocutor” of 1805,\r\nwhich fixed a scale of piecework prices for the Edinburgh printing\r\ntrade.[103] But the chief event of this campaign for the enforcement\r\nof the old laws began in Glasgow. The cotton-weavers of that city,\r\nafter four or five years of Parliamentary agitation for additional\r\nlegislation, resorted to the law empowering the justices to fix the\r\nrates of wages. After an unsuccessful attempt to fix a standard rate by\r\nagreement with a committee of employers, the men’s association which\r\nnow extended throughout the whole of the cotton-weaving districts in\r\nthe United Kingdom commenced legal proceedings at the Lanarkshire\r\nQuarter Sessions. The employers in 1812 disputed the competence of\r\nthe magistrates, and appealed to the Court of Sessions at Edinburgh.\r\nThe Court held that the magistrates were competent to fix a scale of\r\nwages, and a table of piecework rates was accordingly drawn up. The\r\nemployers immediately withdrew from the proceedings; but the operatives\r\nwere nevertheless compelled, at great expense, to produce witnesses\r\nto testify to every one of the numerous rates proposed. After one\r\nhundred and thirty witnesses had been heard, the magistrates at length\r\ndeclared the rates to be reasonable, but made no actual order enforcing\r\nthem. The employers, with few exceptions, refused to accept the table,\r\nwhich it had cost the operatives £3000 to obtain. The result was the\r\nmost extensive strike the trade has ever known. From Carlisle to\r\nAberdeen every loom stopped, forty thousand weavers ceasing work almost\r\nsimultaneously. After three weeks’ strike the employers were preparing\r\nto meet the operatives, when the whole Strike Committee was suddenly\r\narrested by the police, and held to bail under the common law for the\r\ncrime of combination, of which the authorities, in that revolutionary\r\nperiod, were very jealous on purely political grounds. The five\r\nleaders were sentenced to terms of imprisonment varying from four to\r\neighteen months; and this blow broke up the combination, defeated the\r\nstrike, and put an end to the struggles of the operatives against the\r\nprogressive degradation of their wages.[104]\r\n\r\nThe London artisans, though they were not put down by prosecution and\r\nimprisonment, met with no greater success than their Glasgow brethren.\r\nBetween 1810 and 1812 a number of trade societies combined to engage\r\nthe services of a solicitor, who prosecuted masters for employing\r\n“illegal men,” that is to say, men who had not by apprenticeship\r\ngained a right to follow the trade. The original “case” which the\r\njourneymen curriers submitted to counsel in 1810 (fee two guineas),\r\nwith a view to putting in force the Statute of Apprentices, was in\r\nour possession, together with the somewhat hesitating opinion of the\r\nlegal adviser.[105] In a few cases proceedings were even taken against\r\nemployers for having set up in trades to which they had not themselves\r\nserved their time. Convictions were obtained in some instances; but no\r\ncosts were allowed to the prosecutors, who were, on the other hand,\r\ncondemned to pay heavy costs when they failed. Lord Ellenborough,\r\nmoreover, held on appeal that new trades, such as those of engineer\r\nand lockmaker, were not included within the Elizabethan Act. In 1811\r\ncertain journeymen millers of Kent petitioned the justices to fix a\r\nrate of wages under the Elizabethan Act. When the justices refused\r\nto hear the petition a writ of mandamus was applied for. Lord\r\nEllenborough granted the writ to compel them to hear the petition, but\r\nsaid they were to exercise their own discretion as to whether they\r\nwould fix any rate. The justices, on this hint, declined to fix the\r\nwages.[106] It soon became apparent that legal proceedings under these\r\nobsolete statutes were, in face of the adverse bias of the courts,\r\nas futile as they were costly. There was nothing for it then but\r\neither to abandon the line of attack or to petition Parliament to make\r\neffective the still unrepealed laws. This they accordingly did, with\r\nthe unexpected result that the “pernicious” law empowering justices to\r\nfix wages was in 1813 peremptorily repealed.[107]\r\n\r\nThe law thus swept away was but one section of the great Elizabethan\r\nstatute, and its repeal left the other clauses untouched. A Select\r\nCommittee had already, in 1811, reported that “no interference of the\r\nlegislature with the freedom of trade, or with the perfect liberty\r\nof every individual to dispose of his time and of his labour in the\r\nway and on the terms which he may judge most conducive to his own\r\ninterest, can take place without violating general principles of the\r\nfirst importance to the prosperity and happiness of the community;\r\nwithout establishing the most pernicious precedent, or even without\r\naggravating, after a very short time, the pressure of the general\r\ndistress, and imposing obstacles against that distress being ever\r\nremoved.” The repeal of the wages clauses of the statute made this\r\nemphatic declaration of the new doctrine law as far as the fixing of\r\nwages was concerned; but there remained the apprenticeship clauses.\r\nPetitions for the enforcement of these, and their extension to the new\r\ntrades, kept pouring in. They were finally referred to a large and\r\ninfluential committee which included Canning, Huskisson, Sir Robert\r\nPeel, and Sir James Graham among its members. The witnesses examined\r\nwere strongly in favour of the retention of the laws, with amendments\r\nbringing them up to date. The chairman (George Rose) was apparently\r\nconverted to the view of the operatives by the evidence. The committee,\r\nwhich had undoubtedly been appointed to formulate the complete\r\nabolition of the apprenticeship clauses, found itself unable to fulfil\r\nits virtual mandate. Not venturing, in the teeth of the manufacturers\r\nand economists, to recommend the House to comply with the operatives’\r\ndemands, it got out of the difficulty by making no recommendation at\r\nall. Hundreds of petitions in favour of the laws continued to pour in\r\nfrom all parts of the country, 300,000 signatures being for retention\r\nagainst 2000 for repeal, masters often joining in the journeymen’s\r\nprayer. A public meeting of the “Master Manufacturers and Tradesmen\r\nof the Cities of London and Westminster,” at the Freemasons’ Tavern,\r\npassed resolutions strongly supporting the amendment and enforcement\r\nof the existing law. On the other hand, a committee on which the\r\nmaster engineers Maudsley and Galloway were prominent members, argued\r\nforcibly in favour of freedom and against “the monstrous and alarming\r\nbut misguided association.” In 1814 Mr. Serjeant Onslow, who had not\r\nserved on the committee of the previous session, introduced a Bill to\r\nrepeal the whole apprenticeship law. The “Masters and Journeymen of\r\nWestminster” were heard by counsel against this measure, but the House\r\nhad made up its mind in favour of the manufacturers, and by the Act\r\nof 54 Geo. III. c. 96 swept away the apprenticeship clauses of the\r\nstatute, and with them practically the last remnant of that legislative\r\nprotection of the Standard of Life which survived from the Middle\r\nAges.[108] The triumphant manufacturers presented Serjeant Onslow with\r\nseveral pieces of plate for his championship of commercial liberty.[109]\r\n\r\nSo thoroughly had the new doctrine by this time driven out the very\r\nrecollection of the old ideals from the mind of the governing class\r\nthat it was now the operatives who were regarded as innovators, and\r\nwe are hardly surprised to find another committee gravely declaring\r\nthat “the right of every man to employ the capital he inherits, or\r\nhas acquired, according to his own discretion, without molestation\r\nor obstruction, so long as he does not infringe on the rights or\r\nproperty of others, is one of those privileges which the free and\r\nhappy constitution of this country has long accustomed every Briton\r\nto consider as his birthright.”[110] But it must be added that the\r\ngoverning class was by no means impartial in the application of its\r\nnew doctrine. Mediæval regulation acted not only in restriction of\r\nfree competition in the labour market to the pecuniary loss of the\r\nemployers, but also in restriction of free contract to the loss\r\nof the employees, who could only obtain the best terms for their\r\nlabour by collective instead of individual bargaining. Consequently\r\nthe operatives, if they had clearly understood the situation, would\r\nhave been as anxious to abolish the laws against combination as to\r\nmaintain those fixing wages and limiting apprenticeship; just as the\r\ncapitalists, better informed, were no less resolute in maintaining the\r\nanti-combination laws than in repealing the others. We shall presently\r\nsee how slow the workers were to realise this, in spite of the fact\r\nthat the laws against combinations of workmen were maintained in force,\r\nand even increased in severity. Strikes, and any organised resistance\r\nto the employers’ demands, were put down with a high hand. The first\r\ntwenty years of the nineteenth century witnessed a legal persecution\r\nof Trade Unionists as rebels and revolutionists. This persecution,\r\nthwarting the healthy growth of the Unions, and driving their members\r\ninto violence and sedition, but finally leading to the repeal of the\r\nCombination Laws and the birth of the modern Trade Union Movement, will\r\nbe the subject of the next chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] In the first edition we said “of their employment.” This has been\r\nobjected to as implying that Trade Unions have always contemplated\r\na perpetual continuance of the capitalist or wage-system. No such\r\nimplication was intended. Trade Unions have, at various dates during\r\nthe past century at any rate, frequently had aspirations towards a\r\nrevolutionary change in social and economic relations.\r\n\r\n[4] Riley’s _Memorials of London and London Life in the Thirteenth,\r\nFourteenth, and Fifteenth Centuries_ (1888), p. 495 (partly cited in\r\n_Trade Unions_, by William Trant, 1884).\r\n\r\n[5] _Ibid._ pp. 542-3.\r\n\r\n[6] _Ibid._ p. 609; Clode’s _Early History of the Merchant Taylors’\r\nCompany_, vol. i. p. 63.\r\n\r\n[7] _Calendars of State Papers: Letters and Papers, Foreign and\r\nDomestic, Henry VIII._ vol. xiii. part i., 1538, No. 1454, p. 537.\r\nCompare the ephemeral combinations cited by Fagniez, _Études sur\r\nl’industrie et la classe industrielle à Paris_ (Paris, 1877), pp. 76,\r\n82, etc.\r\n\r\n[8] It has been assumed that, in the company of “Bachelors” or “Yeomen\r\nTailors” connected with the Merchant Taylors’ Company of London\r\nbetween 1446 and 1661, we have “for the first time revealed to us the\r\nexistence, and something of the constitution, of a journeyman’s society\r\nwhich succeeded in maintaining itself for a prolonged period.” More\r\ncareful examination of the materials from which this vivid picture of\r\nthis supposed journeyman’s society has been drawn leads us to believe\r\nthat it was not composed of journeymen at all, but of masters. This\r\nmight, in the first place, have been inferred from the fact that in\r\nthe ranks of the supposed journeymen were to be found opulent leaders\r\nlike Richard Hilles, the friend of Cranmer and Bullinger, who “became\r\na Bachelor in Budge of the Yeoman Company” in 1535 (Clode, _Early\r\nHistory of the Merchant Taylors’ Company_, vol. ii. p. 64), and Sir\r\nLeonard Halliday, afterwards Lord Mayor, who was in the Bachelors’\r\nCompany from 1572 to 1594, when “he was elected a member of the\r\nhigher hierarchy of the Corporation” (_ibid._ p. 237). The Bachelors’\r\nCompany, indeed, far from being composed of needy wage-earners, bore\r\nthe greater part of the expense of the pageant in connection with the\r\nmayoralty, and managed the whole proceedings. The Bachelors “in Foynes”\r\nand those “in Budge” are all named as marching in the procession in\r\n“gownes to be welted with velvet, and there jackyttes, cassockes, and\r\ndoublettes to be either of satten damaske, taffataye” (_ibid._ pp.\r\n262-6). And when, in 1609, the Company was assessed to contribute to\r\nthe Plantation of Ulster, the Bachelors contributed nearly as much as\r\nthe merchants (£155, 10s. from ten members as compared with £187, 10s.\r\nfrom nine members (_ibid._ vol. i. pp. 327-9)). Whether the Bachelors’\r\nCompany ever included any large proportion of hired journeymen appears\r\nextremely doubtful, though its object was clearly the regulation of\r\nthe trade. The members, according to the Ordinance of 1613, paid a\r\ncontribution of 2s. 2d. a quarter “for the poor of the fraternity.”\r\nThis may be contrasted with the quarterage of 8d. a year or 2d. per\r\nquarter, levied, according to order of August 1578, on every servant or\r\njourneyman free of the City. The funds of the two companies were kept\r\ndistinct, but frequent donations were made from one to the other, and\r\nnot only from the inferior to the superior (_ibid._ vol. i. pp. 67-9).\r\nThat the Bachelors’ Company was by no means confined to journeymen\r\nis clear. Sir Leonard Halliday, for instance, became a freeman in\r\nApril 1564 on completing his apprenticeship, and at once set up in\r\nbusiness for himself, obtaining a charitable loan for the purpose.\r\nYet, although he prospered in business, “in 1572 we find him assessed\r\nas in the Bachelors’ Company,” and he was not elected to the superior\r\ncompany until 1594 (_ibid._ vol. ii. p. 237). And in the Ordinance of\r\n1507, “for all those persons that shall be abled by the maister and\r\nWardeins to holde hous or shop open,” it is provided that the person\r\ndesiring to set up shop shall not only pay a licence fee, but also “for\r\nhis incomyng to the bachelers’ Company and to be broder with theym\r\niij^s iii^d” (Clode, _Memorials of the Merchant Taylors’ Company_, p.\r\n209). Nor do the instances of its action imply that it had at heart\r\nthe interest of the wage-earners, as distinguished from that of the\r\nemployers. The hostility to foreigners, the desire to secure government\r\nclothing contracts, and the preference for a limitation of apprentices\r\nto two for each employer are all consistent with the theory that\r\nthe Bachelors’ Company was, like its superior, composed of masters,\r\nprobably less opulent than the governing clique, and perhaps occupied\r\nin tailoring rather than in the business of a clothier or merchant. It\r\nis not until 1675 and 1682 that can be traced in the MS. records of\r\nthe Clothworkers’ Company the existence of distinctively journeymen’s\r\ncombinations (_Industrial Organisation in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth\r\nCenturies_, by George Unwin, 1904, p. 199). The other instances of\r\nidentification of “Bachelors’ Companies” or “Yeomen” organisation with\r\njourneymen’s societies are no more convincing than that of the Merchant\r\nTaylors. That the “valets,” serving-men, or journeymen in many trades\r\npossessed some kind of “almsbox,” or charitable funds of their own\r\nis indeed clear, but that this was ever used in trade disputes, or\r\nwas independent of the masters’ control, must at present be regarded\r\nas highly improbable. The strongest instance of independence is\r\nthat of the Oxford cordwainers (_Selections from the Records of the\r\nCity of Oxford_, by William H. Turner, Oxford, 1880). See, on the\r\nwhole subject, the chapter on “Mediæval Journeymen’s Clubs,” in Sir\r\nWilliam Ashley’s _Surveys: Historic and Economic_, 1900; _Industrial\r\nOrganisation in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth Centuries_, by Professor\r\nGeorge Unwin, 1904; and an article on “The Origin of Trade Unionism,”\r\nby Mr. W. A. S. Hewins, in the _Economic Review_, April 1895 (vol. v.).\r\n\r\n[9] Dugdale’s _Antiquities of Warwickshire_ (1656), p. 125.\r\n\r\n[10] Riley’s _Memorials_, p. 653; Clode, _Early History of Merchant\r\nTaylors’ Company_, vol. i. p. 63.\r\n\r\n[11] Compare Fagniez, _Études sur l’industrie et la classe industrielle\r\nà Paris_ (Paris, 1877), p. 123.\r\n\r\n[12] 3 Henry VI. c. 1; see also 34 Edward III. c. 9.\r\n\r\n[13] “Ordinances of Worcester,” Art. lvii. in Toulmin Smith’s _English\r\nGilds_, p. 399.\r\n\r\n[14] Compare the analogous instances given by Fagniez, _Études sur\r\nl’industrie et la classe industrielle à Paris_, p. 203 (Paris, 1877).\r\n\r\n[15] Dr. Brentano has noticed (p. 81) that the great majority of\r\nthe legal regulations of wages in the Middle Ages relate (if not to\r\nagriculture) to the building trades; and it may be that these were,\r\nlike modern cab-fare regulations, intended more for the protection of\r\nthe customer than for that of the capitalist.\r\n\r\n[16] See “Notes on the Organisation of the Mason’s Craft in England,”\r\nby Dr. William Cunningham (_British Academy Proceedings_).\r\n\r\n[17] Such a master craftsmen’s society we see in the Masons’ “Lodge of\r\nAtchison’s Haven,” which, on December 27, 1735, passed the following\r\nresolution: “The Company of Atchison’s Haven being mett together, have\r\nfound Andrew Kinghorn guilty of a most atrocious crime against the\r\nwhole Trade of Masonry, and he not submitting himself to the Company\r\nfor taking his work so cheap that no man could have his bread of it.\r\nTherefore in not submitting himself he has excluded himself from the\r\nsaid Company; and therefore the Company doth hereby enact that no man,\r\nneither fellow craft nor enter’d prentice after this shall work as\r\njourneyman under the said Andrew Kinghorn, under the penalty of being\r\ncut off as well as he. Likewise if any man shall follow the example of\r\nthe said Andrew Kinghorn in taking work at eight pounds Scots per rood\r\nthe walls being twenty feet high, and rebates at eighteen pennies Scots\r\nper foot, that they shall be cut off in the same manner” (_Sketch of\r\nthe Incorporation of Masons_, by James Cruikshank, Glasgow, 1879, pp.\r\n131, 132).\r\n\r\n[18] Thorold Rogers points out that the Merton College bell-tower was\r\nbuilt in 1448-50 by direct employment at wages. The new quadrangle,\r\nearly in the seventeenth century, was put out to contract with a master\r\nmason and a master carpenter respectively, but the college still\r\nsupplied all the material (_History of Agriculture and Prices_, vol. i.\r\npp. 258-60; iii. pp. 720-37; v. pp. 478, 503, 629).\r\n\r\n[19] _Industrial Organisation in the Sixteenth and Seventeenth\r\nCenturies_, by George Unwin, 1904, p. 201. In this connection may\r\nbe mentioned the London watermen, who have always dealt directly\r\nwith their customers, and who possess a tradition of having been\r\ncontinuously organised since 1350. Power to regulate the trade of\r\nwatermen was, in 1555, conferred by Act of Parliament upon the\r\nthen incorporated Thames Watermen and Lightermen’s Company, the\r\nadministration of which appears to have been, from the first,\r\nentirely in the hands of the master lightermen. The watermen, who\r\nhad no masters, were compelled to take out the freedom of this\r\nCompany, and the existing Trade Union, the Amalgamated Society of\r\nWatermen and Lightermen, was established in 1872 for the express\r\npurpose of obtaining some representation of the working watermen\r\nand the journeymen lightermen on the Court of the Company. Previous\r\nassociations of working watermen for trade purposes seem to have been\r\nin existence in 1789 (a Rotherhithe Society of Watermen) and in 1799\r\n(Friendly Society of Watermen usually plying at the Hermitage Stairs,\r\nin the parish of St. John, Wapping); and Mayhew describes, in 1850,\r\nlocal “turnway societies,” regulating the sharing of custom, and a\r\nWatermen’s Protective Society, to resist non-freemen (_London Labour\r\nand the London Poor_, 1851).\r\n\r\n[20] Schanz, however, in his _Zur Geschichte der deutschen\r\nGesellenverbände_ (Leipzig, 1877), suggests that the associations of\r\njourneymen which flourished in Germany side by side with the Craft\r\nGilds prior to the Thirty Years’ War (1618) were, in fact, virtually\r\nTrade Unions. Compare Schmoller’s _Strassburger Tucher-und Weberzunft_\r\n(Strassburg, 1879). Professor G. Des Marez, the learned archivist\r\nof Brussels, supplies evidence of the persistence of journeymen’s\r\norganisations in Belgium, resembling those of Germany, down to the\r\nbeginning of the sixteenth century; and of the rise of new ones towards\r\nthe end of the seventeenth century, without trace of continuity (in\r\n_Le Compagnonnage des chapeliers bruxellois_, Brussels, 1909.) See\r\nProfessor Unwin’s article in _English Historical Review_ (October\r\n1910); and compare _Les Compagnonnages des arts et métiers à Dijon aux\r\nxvii^e et xviii^e siècles_, by H. House, 1909, and _Enquêtes sur les\r\nassociations professionnelles d’artisans et ouvriers en Belgique_, by\r\nE. Vandervelde, 1891.\r\n\r\n[21] Dr. Brentano’s essay was originally prefixed to Toulmin Smith’s\r\n_English Gilds_, published by the Early English Text Society in 1870.\r\nIt was republished separately as _The History and Development of Gilds\r\nand the Origin of Trades Unions_ (135 pp., 1870), and it is to this\r\nedition that we refer. Dr. Brentano’s larger work, _Die Arbeitergilden\r\nder Gegenwart_ (Leipzig, 2 vols., 1871-72), includes this essay, and\r\nalso his article in the _North British Review_ for October 1870 on\r\n“The Growth of a Trades Union.” It is only fair to say that in this,\r\nthe ablest study of English Trade Union history down to that time, Dr.\r\nBrentano lent no support to the popular idea of any actual descent\r\nof the Trade Unions from the gilds. The _Cobden Club Essays_ (1872)\r\ncontain a good article on Trade Unions, by Joseph Gostick, in which it\r\nis argued that these associations were, in England, unknown before the\r\neighteenth century, and had no connection with the gilds.\r\n\r\n[22] Page 102.\r\n\r\n[23] The first hundred pages of George Howell’s _Conflicts of Capital\r\nand Labour_ (first edition, 1877; second edition, 1890) are a close\r\nparaphrase of Dr. Brentano’s essay, practically the whole of which\r\nappears, often in the same words, as Howell’s own. But already in 1871\r\nDr. Brentano, in his _Arbeitergilden der Gegenwart_ (vol. i. ch. iii.\r\np. 83), expressly connected the Trade Unions, like Schanz, not with the\r\ngilds, but with the Journeymen Fraternities, which he suggests may have\r\n“awaked under changed circumstances to new strength and life, and to a\r\nnew policy.” We gather that Sir William Ashley inclines to this view.\r\n“My own impression,” he says, “is that we shall by and by find that,\r\nlike the usages of the German journeymen in the eighteenth century\r\nthat centred into Herbergen, the trade clubs of eighteenth century\r\nEngland were broken-down survivals from an earlier period, undergoing,\r\nwith the advent of the married journeyman and other causes, the slow\r\ntransformation from which they emerged in the nineteenth century as the\r\nnuclei of the modern Trade Union.” Sir William Ashley does not assert\r\nthat any continuity of organisation can be proved. “What is suggested\r\nis only that the habit of acting together in certain ways, which we\r\nfind to characterise the journeymen of the eighteenth century, had been\r\nformed in a much earlier period” (_Surveys: Historic and Economic_, by\r\nSir William Ashley, 1900).\r\n\r\n[24] So long as the Companies continued to exercise any jurisdiction\r\nover their trades, we find them (as in the cases of the London\r\nFramework-knitters and the Dublin Silkweavers) supported by any\r\nworkmen’s combinations that existed. In exceptional instances, such\r\nas the London Brushmakers, Basketmakers, and Watermen, we find this\r\nalliance for the exclusion of “illegal men” continuing into the\r\nnineteenth century, and (as regards the Watermen) down to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n[25] _Macmillan’s Magazine_ (February 1861), relying on the Social\r\nScience _Report on Trade Societies and Strikes_ (1860), p. 521.\r\n\r\n[26] See Appendix _On the Assumed Connection between the Trade Unions\r\nand the Gilds in Dublin_.\r\n\r\n[27] _Gilds and Trade Unions_ (1870), p. 54.\r\n\r\n[28] _History of Industry and Commerce_, vol. i. p. 310. Dr. Gross, in\r\nhis _Gild Merchant_, apparently takes a similar view.\r\n\r\n[29] See his _Introduction to Economic History and Theory_, vol. i.\r\n(1891); vol. ii. (1893); see also his _Surveys: Historic and Economic_\r\n(1900).\r\n\r\n[30] Dr. Brentano himself makes this clear. “We must not forget that\r\nthese gilds were not unions of labourers in the present sense of the\r\nword, but of persons who, with the help of some stock, carried on their\r\ncraft on their own account. The gild contests were, consequently, not\r\ncontests for acquiring political equality for labour and property,\r\nbut for the recognition of political equality of trade stock and real\r\nproperty in the towns” (_Gilds and Trade Unions_, p. 73).\r\n\r\n[31] Jupp’s _History of the Carpenters’ Company_, p. 313, second\r\nedition, 1848. In certain cases we see the workmen seeking\r\nincorporation as a gild or company, in order that they might themselves\r\nlawfully regulate their trades. Thus, in 1670 the wage-earning\r\nwoodsawyers of the City of London, who were employed by the members of\r\nthe Carpenters’, Joiners’ and Shipwrights’ Companies, formally applied\r\nto the Corporation to be made a Company. Their employers strongly\r\nobjected, alleging that they had already by combination raised their\r\nwages during the past quarter of a century from 5s. to nearly 10s.\r\nper load; that they were only day labourers who worked on material\r\nprovided by their employers, and consequently not entitled to rank as\r\nmasters; and that if their combination were recognised by incorporation\r\nthey would be able to bring the whole building trade to a standstill,\r\nas experience had already demonstrated even without incorporation.\r\nMoreover, their main object, it was alleged, was to exclude from\r\nemployment “all that sort of labourers who daily resort to the City\r\nof London and parts adjacent, and by that means keep the wages and\r\nprices of these sorts of labourers at an equal and indifferent rate;\r\nand then success would be an evil precedent, all other labourers, the\r\nmasons, bricklayers, plasterers, etc., having the same reason to allege\r\nfor incorporation” (_Ibid._ p. 307). The London coal-porters in 1699\r\nunsuccessfully petitioned the House of Commons that a Bill might be\r\npassed to establish them as “a Fellowship in such government and rules\r\nas shall be thought meet” (House of Commons Journals, vol. xiii. p.\r\n69). Professor Unwin suggests that it was “by its failure along these\r\ntraditional lines” that “the wage-earning class was driven into secret\r\ncombinations, from the obscurity of which the Trade Union did not\r\nemerge till the 19th century” (_Industrial Organisation in the 16th and\r\n17th Centuries_, 1904).\r\n\r\n[32] “The Trade Union of to-day is often spoken of as the lineal\r\ndescendant of the ancient Craft Gilds. There is, however, no direct\r\nor indirect connection between the ancient and modern forms of trade\r\ncombination. Beyond the fact that they each had for their objects\r\nthe establishment of certain trade regulations, and the provision of\r\ncertain similar benefits, they had nothing in common.” “Trade Unions\r\nas a Means of Improving the Conditions of Labour,” by John Burnett;\r\npublished in _The Claims of Labour_ (Edinburgh, 1886).\r\n\r\n“To attempt to find an immediate connection between the Gild and\r\nthe Trade Union is like attempting to derive the English House of\r\nCommons from the Saxon Witanagemot. In the one case as in the other\r\nthe two institutions were separated by centuries of development, and\r\nthe earlier one was dead before the later one was born” (_Industrial\r\nOrganisation in the 16th and 17th Centuries_, by Professor George\r\nUnwin, 1904, p. 8).\r\n\r\n[33] Goldasti’s _Constitutiones Imperiales_, tom. iv. p. 189, quoted by\r\nDr. Brentano, p. 60.\r\n\r\n[34] A pamphlet of 1669 contains what appears at first sight to be a\r\nmention of Trade Unionism. “The general conspiracy amongst artificers\r\nand labourers is so apparent that within these twenty-five years the\r\nwages of joiners, bricklayers, carpenters, etc., are increased, I mean\r\nwithin 40 miles of London (against all reason and good government),\r\nfrom eighteen and twenty pence a day, to 2/6 and 3/-, and mere\r\nlabourers from 10 and 12 pence a day unto 16 and 20 pence, and this\r\nnot since the dreadful fire of London only, but some time before. A\r\njourneyman shoemaker has now in London (and proportionately in the\r\ncountry) 14 pence for making that pair of shoes, which within these\r\n12 years he made for 10 pence.... Nor has the increase of wages\r\namongst us been occasioned by quickness of trade and want of hands (as\r\nsome do suppose) which are indeed justifiable reasons, but through\r\nan exacting humour and evil disposition in our people (like our\r\nGravesend watermen, who by some temporary and mean pretences of the\r\nlate Dutch war, have raised their ferry double to what it was, and\r\nfinding the sweet thereof, keep it up still), that so they may live\r\nthe better above their station, and work so much the fewer days by\r\nhow much the more they exact in their wages” (_Usury at Six Per Cent.\r\nExamined_, by Thomas Manley, London, 1669). But we cannot infer from\r\nthis unique and ambiguous passage anything more than the possibility\r\nof ephemeral combinations. It is significant that Defoe, with all his\r\ndetailed description of English industry in 1724, does not mention any\r\ncombinations of workmen.\r\n\r\n[35] In an able pamphlet dated 1681, entitled _The Trade of England\r\nRevived_, it is stated that “we cannot make our English cloth so\r\ncheap as they do in other countries, because of the strange idleness\r\nand stubbornness of our poor,” who insist on excessive wages. But\r\nthe author attributes this state of things, not to the existence of\r\ncombinations, of which he seems never to have heard, but to the Poor\r\nLaw and the prevalence of almsgiving.\r\n\r\n[36] _Wealth of Nations_, bk. i. ch. x. p. 59 of McCulloch’s edition,\r\n1863. In an operative’s description, dated 1809, of the gatherings\r\nof the Paisley weavers, we see the Trade Union in the making. “The\r\nPaisley operatives are of a free, communicative disposition. They\r\nare fond to inform one another in anything respecting trade, and in\r\norder to receive information in a collective capacity they have, for\r\na long course of years, associated in a friendly manner in societies\r\ndenominated clubs.... When met the first hour is devoted to reading\r\nthe daily newspapers out aloud.... At nine o’clock the chairman calls\r\nsilence; then the report of trade is heard. The chairman reports first\r\nwhat he knows or what he has heard of such a manufacturing house or\r\nhouses, as wishing to engage operatives for such fabric or fabrics;\r\nlikewise the price, the number of the yarn, etc. Then each reports\r\nas he is seated; so in the period of an hour not only the state of\r\nthe trade is known, but any difference that has taken place between\r\nmanufacturers and operatives” (_An Answer to Mr. Carlile’s Sketches of\r\nPaisley_, by William Taylor, Paisley, 1809, pp. 15-17).\r\n\r\n[37] See Dunning’s account of the origin of the Consolidated Society\r\nof Bookbinders in 1779-80, in the Social Science Association’s _Report\r\non Trade Societies_, 1860, p. 93; also _Workers on their Industries_,\r\nedited by F.

Local friendly societies\r\ngiving sick pay and providing for funeral expenses had sprung up all\r\nover England during the eighteenth century. Towards its close their\r\nnumber seems to have rapidly increased until, in some parts at any\r\nrate, every village ale-house became a centre for one or more of\r\nthese humble and spontaneous organisations. The rules of upwards of\r\na hundred of these societies, dating between 1750 and 1820, and all\r\ncentred round Newcastle-on-Tyne, are preserved in the British Museum.\r\nAt Nottingham, in 1794, fifty-six of these clubs joined in the annual\r\nprocession (_Nottingham Journal_, June 14, 1794). So long as they were\r\ncomposed indiscriminately of men of all trades, it is probable that\r\nno distinctively Trade Union action could arise from their meetings.\r\nBut in some cases, for various reasons, such as high contributions,\r\nmigratory habits, or the danger of the calling, the sick and burial\r\nclub was confined to men of a particular trade. This kind of friendly\r\nsociety frequently became a Trade Union. Some societies of this type\r\ncan trace their existence for nearly a century and a half. The Glasgow\r\ncoopers, for instance, have had a local trade friendly society,\r\nconfined to journeymen coopers, ever since 1752. The London Sailmakers\r\nBurial Society dates from 1740. The Newcastle shoemakers established a\r\nsimilar society as early as 1719 (_Observations upon the Report from\r\nthe Select Committee of the House of Commons on the laws respecting\r\nFriendly Societies_, by the Rev. J. T. Becher, Prebendary of Southwell,\r\n1826). On the occurrence of any dispute with the employers their funds,\r\nas this contemporary observer in another pamphlet deplores, “have also\r\ntoo frequently been converted into engines of abuse by paying weekly\r\nsums to artisans out of work, and have thereby encouraged combinations\r\namong workmen not less injurious to the misguided members than to\r\nthe Public Weal” (_Observations on the Rise and Progress of Friendly\r\nSocieties_, 1824, p. 55). Similar friendly societies among workmen of\r\nparticular trades appear to have existed in the Netherlands in the\r\nseventeenth and eighteenth centuries, where they perhaps bridged the\r\ngap between the mediæval fraternities and the modern Trade Unions (see\r\nreview in the _English Historical Review_, October 1918, of P. J.\r\nBlok’s _Geschiedenes einer Hollandischen Stad_).\r\n\r\n[39] Schanz (_Gesellenverbände_, p. 25) follows Brentano (p. 94) in\r\nattributing the formation of journeymen’s fraternities in the Middle\r\nAges mainly to a desire to provide for the wandering craftsmen.\r\nThe connection between the “Herbergen” or “Schenken,” designed to\r\nfind lodging and employment, with the journeymen’s associations was\r\ncertainly close. (See Dr. Bruno Schoenlank’s article in 1894, quoted in\r\nSir William Ashley’s _Surveys: Historic and Economic_, 1900.) It may be\r\nsuggested that the contrast between the absence or scanty existence of\r\nsuch fraternities in England and their spread in Germany is, perhaps,\r\nto be ascribed in some measure to the fact that English journeymen seem\r\nnever to have adopted the German custom of “Wanderjahre,” or regular\r\nhabit of spending, on completing their apprenticeship, a few years in\r\ntravelling about the country to complete their training. When the local\r\nprivileges of the old gilds had fallen somewhat into abeyance, the\r\nrestrictions of the successive Settlement Acts must in England, to some\r\nextent, have checked the mobility of labour. But, from the beginning of\r\nthe eighteenth century at any rate, we find it customary for journeymen\r\nof certain trades--it is to be noticed that these are relatively new\r\ntrades in England--to “tramp” from town to town in search of work,\r\nand the description, subsequently quoted, of the organisations of the\r\nwoolcombers and worsted weavers in 1741, shows that the relief of these\r\ntravelling journeymen was a prominent object of the early unions.\r\nThe hatters in the middle of the eighteenth century had a regular\r\narrangement for such relief. The compositors at the very beginning\r\nof the nineteenth century had already covered the country with a\r\nnetwork of local clubs, the chief function of which appears to have\r\nbeen the facilitation of this wandering in search of work. And the\r\ncalico-printers had a systematic way of issuing a ticket which entitled\r\nthe tramp to collect from each journeyman, in any “print-field” that he\r\nvisited, at first a voluntary contribution, and latterly a fixed relief\r\nof a halfpenny per head in England, and a penny per head in Scotland\r\n(_Minutes of evidence taken before the Committee to whom the petition\r\nof the several journeymen Calico-printers and others working in that\r\ntrade, etc., was referred_, July 4, 1804, and the _Report_ from that\r\nCommittee, July 17, 1806).\r\n\r\n[40] J. M. Ludlow, in article in _Macmillan’s Magazine_, February 1861.\r\n\r\n[41] _Work and the Workman_, by Dr. J. K. Ingram (Address to the Trades\r\nUnion Congress at Dublin, 1880).\r\n\r\n[42] Benjamin Franklin mentions the “chapel” and its regulations in\r\n1725. A copy, dated 1734, of the _Rules and Orders to be observed by\r\nthe Members of this Chapel: by Compositors, by Pressmen, by Both_, is\r\npreserved in the Place MSS. 27799--88.\r\n\r\n[43] This petition (in the British Museum) is printed in Brentano’s\r\n_Gilds and Trade Unions_, p. 97. Benjamin Franklin, who worked in\r\nLondon printing offices in 1725, makes no mention of Trade Unionism.\r\nThe Stationers’ Company continued, so far as the City of London was\r\nconcerned, to regulate apprenticeship; and we see it, in 1775, taking\r\nsteps to prevent employers having an undue number. Regulations agreed\r\nto by the employers and the compositors, as to the rates of pay for\r\ndifferent kinds of work, can be traced back to 1785, at least. A copy\r\nof the rules of “The Phœnix, or Society of Compositors” meeting at “The\r\nHole in the Wall” tavern, Fleet Street, shows that this organisation\r\nwas “instituted March 12th, 1792.” In 1798 five members of the\r\n“Pressmen’s Friendly Society” were indicted for conspiracy in meeting\r\nfor the purpose of restricting the number of apprentices (they sought\r\nto limit them to three for seven presses). Although the secretary to\r\nthe “Society of Master Printers” had requested these men to attend\r\nthe meeting, in order to get settled the pending dispute, they were\r\nconvicted and sentenced to two years’ imprisonment (_Conflicts of\r\nCapital and Labour_, by George Howell, 1890, p. 92).\r\n\r\n[44] For this interesting case we are indebted to Professor George\r\nUnwin’s researches in the records of the Feltmakers’ Company, whose\r\n“Court Book” contains the record. See _Industrial Organisation in the\r\n16th and 17th Centuries_, by George Unwin, 1904; “A Seventeenth-Century\r\nTrade Union,” by the same, in _Economic Journal_, 1910, pp. 394-403;\r\nthe chapter “Mediæval Journeymen’s Clubs” in Sir William Ashley’s\r\n_Surveys, Historic and Economic_, 1900.\r\n\r\n[45] House of Commons Journals, vol. xxxvi.; 8 Eliz. c. 11; 1 James\r\nI. c. 14; and 17 George III. c. 55; Place MSS. 27799--68; Committee\r\non Artisans and Machinery, 1824; _Industrial Democracy_, p. 11;\r\n“A Seventeenth Century Trade Union,” by Professor George Unwin,\r\nin _Economic Journal_, 1910, pp. 394-403; _Conflicts of Capital\r\nand Labour_, by G.

The organisation evidently\r\ncontinued in existence, at least in its local form; but the existing\r\nnational “Journeymen Hatters’ Trade Union of Great Britain and Ireland”\r\nclaims to date only from 1798. In 1806 the Macclesfield hatters were\r\nindicted for conspiracy in striking for higher wages, and sentenced to\r\ntwelve months’ imprisonment. Particulars of this organisation will be\r\nfound in _The Trial of W. Davenport ... Hatters of Macclesfield for a\r\nConspiracy against their Masters_ ... by Thomas Mulineaux, 1806.\r\n\r\n[46] For the whole history of this industry, see _The Tailoring Trade_,\r\nby F. W.

There is\r\nevidence of very similar organisation in other towns. At Birmingham,\r\nfor instance, there was a systematically organised strike in 1777\r\nagainst a reduction of wages, which lasted for some months (Langford’s\r\n_Century of Birmingham Life_, pp. 225, etc.; _The Tailoring Trade_, by\r\nF.

Already in 1622, a year of\r\ndepression of trade, we hear of numerous riots and tumults among the\r\nweavers of the West of England, notably those of certain Devonshire\r\ntowns, who paraded the streets demanding work or food (_Quarter\r\nSessions from Elizabeth to Anne_, by A.

In 1729 the\r\nBristol weavers, “while the corporation was at church,” riotously\r\nattacked the house of an obnoxious employer, and had to be repulsed by\r\nthe troops (_History of Bristol_, p. 261, by J. Evans; Bristol, 1824).\r\nIn 1738 they forced the clothiers to sign a bond that they would “for\r\never forward” give fifteen pence a yard for weaving, under penalty of\r\n£1000 (_Gentlemen’s Magazine_, 1738, p. 658; see also “An Essay on\r\nRiots, their Causes and Cure,” published in the _Gloucester Journal_,\r\nand reprinted in the _Gentlemen’s Magazine_, 1739, pp. 7-10). In 1756\r\nthere was an extensive and serious uprising (see _A State of the Case\r\nand Narrative of Facts relating to the late Commotion and Rising of the\r\nWeavers in the County of Gloucester_, in the Gough Collection, Bodleian\r\nLibrary).\r\n\r\n[59] Defoe’s _Tour_, vol. iii. pp. 97-101, 116 (1724).

The gild system at no time extended to any but the\r\nskilled handicraftsmen, alongside of whom must always have worked a\r\nlarge number of unapprenticed labourers, who received less than half\r\nthe wages of the craftsmen. We venture to suggest that it is doubtful\r\nwhether the Craft Gilds at any time numbered as large a proportion of\r\nthe working population as the Trade Unions of the present day. See\r\n_Industrial Democracy_, p. 480.\r\n\r\n[73] “Tumults,” or strikes, among the coal-miners are occasionally\r\nmentioned during the eighteenth century, but no lasting combinations.\r\nSee, for those in Somerset, Carmarthenshire, etc., in 1757,\r\n_Gentlemen’s Magazine_, 1757, pp. 90, 185, 285, etc. In 1765 there\r\nwas a prolonged strike against the “yearly bond” by the Durham miners\r\n(_Calendar of Home Office Papers_, 1765; Sykes’ _Local Records_, vol.\r\ni, p. 254). The Keelmen, who loaded coals on the Tyne, “mutinied”\r\nin 1654 and 1671 “for the increase of wages”; and there were fierce\r\nstrikes in 1710, 1744, 1750, 1771, and 1794. We have, however, no\r\nparticulars as to their associations, which were probably ephemeral\r\n(Sykes’ _Local Records_; Richardson’s _Local Historian’s Table Book_;\r\n_Gentlemen’s Magazine_, 1750).\r\n\r\n[74] Many instances of insolence and aggression by the woolcombers are\r\non record; the employers’ advertisements in the _Nottingham Journal_,\r\nAugust 31, 1795, and the _Leicester Herald_ of June 1792, are only two\r\nout of many similar recitals.\r\n\r\n[75] _Jubilee Souvenir History of the Amalgamated Society of\r\nEngineers_, 1901, p. 12.\r\n\r\n[76] That such clubs were common in the handicraft trades in London as\r\nearly as 1720 appears from the following extract from _The Case of the\r\nMaster Taylors residing within the Cities of London and Westminster_,\r\na petition which led to the Act of 1720: “This combination of the\r\nJourneymen Taylors ... is of very ill example to Journeymen in all\r\nother trades; as is sufficiently seen in the Journeymen Curriers,\r\nSmiths, Farriers, Sailmakers, Coachmakers, and artificers of divers\r\nother arts and mysteries, who have actually entered into Confederacies\r\nof the like nature; and the Journeymen Carpenters, Bricklayers, and\r\nJoyners have taken some steps for that purpose, and only wait to see\r\nthe event of others.” And the Journeymen Tailors in their petition of\r\n1745 allude to the large number of “Monthly Clubs” among the London\r\nhandicraftsmen. With regard to the curriers at this date, see Place\r\nMSS, 27801--246, 247.\r\n\r\nIt may be conveniently noticed here that, although strikes are, as we\r\nhave seen, as old as the fourteenth century at least, the word “strike”\r\nwas not commonly used in this sense until the latter part of the\r\neighteenth century. The Oxford Dictionary gives the first instance of\r\nits use as in 1768, when the _Annual Register_ refers to the hatters\r\nhaving “struck” for a rise in wages. The derivation appears to be from\r\nthe sailors’ term of “striking” the mast, thus bringing the movement to\r\na stop.\r\n\r\n[77] So much is this the case that Dr. Brentano asserts that “Trade\r\nUnions originated with the non-observance of” the Elizabethan Statute\r\nof Apprentices (p. 104), and that their primary object was, in all\r\ncases, the enforcement of the law on the subject.\r\n\r\n[78] Preamble to “An Act touching Weavers” (2 and 3 Philip and Mary, c.\r\nxi.); see Froude’s _History of England_, vol. i. pp. 57-9; and W.

Every Union that can nowadays claim an existence of\r\nover a century possesses a romantic legend of its early years. The\r\nmidnight meeting of patriots in the corner of a field, the buried box\r\nof records, the secret oath, the terms of imprisonment of the leading\r\nofficials--all these are in the sagas of the older Unions, and form\r\nmaterial out of which, in an age untroubled by historical criticism, a\r\nsemi-mythical origin might easily have been created. That the legend is\r\nnot without a basis of fact, we shall see in tracing the actual effect\r\nupon the Trade Union Movement of the legal prohibitions of combinations\r\nof wage-earners which prevailed throughout the United Kingdom up\r\nto 1824. But we shall find that some combinations of journeymen\r\nwere at all times recognised by the law, that many others were only\r\nspasmodically interfered with, and that the utmost rigour of the\r\nCombination Laws was not felt until the far-reaching change of policy\r\nmarked by the severe Acts of 1799-1800, which applied to all industries\r\nwhatsoever. This will lead us naturally to the story of the repeal of\r\nthe whole series of Combination Laws in 1824-5, the most impressive\r\nevent in the early history of the movement.\r\n\r\nThere is a clear distinction--at any rate, as regards England--between\r\nthe various statutes which forbade combination prior to the end of the\r\neighteenth century, and the general Combination Acts of 1799-1800. In\r\nthe numerous earlier Acts recited and repealed in 1824 the prohibition\r\nof combination was in all cases incidental to the regulation of the\r\nindustry. It was assumed to be the business of Parliament and the law\r\ncourts to regulate the conditions of labour; and combinations could,\r\nno more than individuals, be permitted to interfere in disputes for\r\nwhich a legal remedy was provided. The object primarily aimed at by\r\nthe statutes was not the prohibition of combinations, but the fixing\r\nof wages, the prevention of embezzlement or damage, the enforcement of\r\nthe contract of service or the proper arrangements for apprenticeship.\r\nAnd although combinations to interfere with these statutory aims were\r\nobviously illegal, and were usually expressly prohibited, it was an\r\nincidental result that combinations formed to promote the objects of\r\nthe legislation, however objectionable they might be to employers, were\r\napparently not regarded as unlawful.[111]\r\n\r\nThus one of the earliest types of combination among journeymen--the\r\nsociety to enforce the law--seems always to have been tacitly accepted\r\nas permissible. Although it is probable that such associations came\r\ntechnically within the definitions of combination and conspiracy,\r\nwhether under the common law or the early statutes, we know of\r\nno case in which they were indicted as illegal. We have already\r\ndescribed, for instance, how, in 1726, the woollen weavers of\r\nWiltshire and Somersetshire openly combined to present a petition to\r\nthe King in Council against their masters, the broad clothiers. The\r\nPrivy Council, far from deeming the action of the weavers illegal,\r\nconsidered and dealt with their complaint. And when the employers\r\npersisted in disobeying the law, we have seen how, in 1756, the\r\nFraternity of Woollen Clothweavers petitioned the House of Commons\r\nto make more effectual the power of the justices to fix wages, and\r\nobtained a new Act of Parliament in accordance with their desires.\r\nThe almost perpetual combinations of the framework knitters between\r\n1710 and 1800 were never made the subject of legal proceedings. The\r\ncombinations of the London silkweavers obtained a virtual sanction\r\nby the Spitalfields Acts, under which the delegates of the workmen’s\r\norganisations regularly appeared before the justices, who fixed and\r\nrevised the piecework prices. Even in 1808, after the stringency of\r\nthe law against combinations had been greatly increased, the Glasgow\r\nand Lancashire cotton-weavers were permitted openly to combine for the\r\npurpose of seeking a legal fixing of wages, with the results already\r\ndescribed. Nor was it only the combination to obtain a legally fixed\r\nrate of wages that was left unmolested by the law. Combinations to\r\nput in force the sections of the Statute of Apprentices (5 Eliz. c.\r\n4), or other prohibitions of the employment of “illegal workmen,”\r\noccurred at intervals down to 1813. In 1749 a club of journeymen\r\npainters of the City of London proceeded against a master painter\r\nfor employing a non-freeman; and the proceedings led, in 1750, to\r\na conference of thirty journeymen and thirty masters with the City\r\nCorporation, at which the regulations were altered.[112] No one seems\r\nto have questioned the legality of the 1811-13 outburst of combinations\r\nto prosecute masters who had not served an apprenticeship, or who\r\nwere employing unapprenticed workmen. One reason, doubtless, for the\r\nimmunity of combinations to enforce the law was that they included\r\nemployers and sympathisers of all ranks. For instance, the combinations\r\nin 1811-13 to enforce the apprenticeship laws comprised both masters\r\nand journeymen, who were equally aggrieved by the competition of the\r\nnew capitalist and his “hirelings.”[113] The Yorkshire Clothiers’\r\nCommunity, or “Brief Institution,” to which reference has already been\r\nmade, included, in some of its ramifications, the “domestic” master\r\nmanufacturers, who fought side by side with the journeymen against the\r\nnew factory system.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, combinations of journeymen to regulate for\r\nthemselves their wages and conditions of employment stood, from\r\nthe first, on a different footing. The common law doctrine of the\r\nillegality of proceedings “in restraint of trade,” as subsequently\r\ninterpreted by the judges, of itself made illegal all combinations\r\nwhatsoever of journeymen to regulate the conditions of their work.\r\nMoreover, with the regulation by law of wages and the conditions of\r\nemployment, any combination to resist the order of the justices on\r\nthese matters was obviously of the nature of rebellion, and was, in\r\nfact, put down like any individual disobedience of the law. Nor was\r\nexpress statute law against combinations wanting. The statute of 1305,\r\nentitled, “Who be Conspirators and who be Champertors” (33 Edw. I.\r\nst. 2), was in 1818 held to apply to a combination to raise wages\r\namong cotton-spinners, whose leaders were sentenced to two years’\r\nimprisonment under this Act. The “Bill of Conspiracies of Victuallers\r\nand Craftsmen” of 1549 (2 and 3 Edw. VI. c. 15), though aimed primarily\r\nat combinations to keep up the prices charged to consumers, clearly\r\nincludes within its prohibitions any combinations of journeymen\r\ncraftsmen to keep up wages or reduce hours.\r\n\r\nIt is some proof of the novelty of the workmen’s combinations in the\r\nearly part of the eighteenth century, that neither the employers nor\r\nthe authorities thought at first of resorting to the very sufficient\r\npowers of the existing law against them. When, in 1720, the master\r\ntailors of London found themselves confronted with an organised\r\nbody of journeymen claiming to make a collective bargain, seriously\r\n“in restraint of trade,” they turned, not to the law courts, but to\r\nParliament for protection, and obtained, as we have seen, the Act “for\r\nregulating the Journeymen Tailors within the bills of mortality” (7\r\nGeo. I. st. 1, c. 13, amended by 8 Geo. III. c. 17).[114] Similarly,\r\nwhen the clothiers of the West of England began between 1717 and\r\n1725 to be inconvenienced by the “riotous and tumultuous clubs and\r\nsocieties” of woolcombers and weavers, who made bye-laws and maintained\r\na Standard Rate,[115] they did not put in force the existing law, but\r\nsuccessfully petitioned Parliament for the Act “to prevent unlawful\r\ncombinations of workmen employed in the Woollen Manufactures” (12 Geo.\r\nI. c. 34). Indeed, prior to the general Acts of 1799 and 1800 against\r\nall combinations of journeymen, Parliament was, from the beginning\r\nof the eighteenth century, perpetually enacting statutes forbidding\r\ncombinations in particular trades.[116]\r\n\r\nIn the English statutes this prohibition of combination was, as we have\r\nseen, only a secondary feature, incidental to the main purpose of the\r\nlaw. The case is different with regard to the early Irish Acts, the\r\nterms of which point to a much sharper cleavage between masters and\r\nmen, due, perhaps, to difference of religion and race. The very first\r\nstatute against combinations which was passed by the Irish Parliament,\r\nthe Act of 1729 (3 Geo. II. c. 14), contained no provisions protecting\r\nthe wage-earner, and prohibited combinations in all trades whatsoever.\r\nThe Act of 1743 (17 Geo. II. c. 8), called forth by the failure of\r\nthe previous prohibition, equally confined itself to drastic penal\r\nmeasures, including the punishment of the keepers of the public-houses\r\nwhich were used for meetings. But in later years the English practice\r\nseems to have been followed; for the laws of 1758 (31 Geo. II. c.\r\n17), 1763 (3 Geo. III. 34, sec. 23), 1771 (11 and 12 Geo. III. c. 18,\r\nsec. 40, and c. 33), and 1779 (19 and 20 Geo. III. c. 19, c. 24, and\r\nc. 36) provide for the fixing of wages, and contain other regulations\r\nof industry, amongst which the prohibition of combinations comes as a\r\nmatter of course.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the century, at any rate, the common law, both in England\r\nand in Ireland, had been brought to the aid of the special statutes,\r\nand the judges were ruling that any conspiracy to do an act which\r\nthey considered unlawful in a combination, even if not criminal in an\r\nindividual, was against the common law. Soon the legislature followed\r\nsuit. In 1799 the Act 39 Geo. III. c. 81 expressly penalised all\r\ncombinations whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe grounds for this drastic measure appear to have been found in the\r\nmarked increase of Trade Unionism among workers of various kinds. The\r\noperatives’ combinations were regarded as being in the nature of mutiny\r\nagainst their employers and masters; destructive of the “discipline”\r\nnecessary to the expansion of trade; and interfering with the right of\r\nthe employer to “do what he liked with his own.” The immediate occasion\r\nwas a petition from London engineering employers, complaining of an\r\nalarming strike of the millwrights. This led to a Bill suppressing\r\ncombination in the engineering trade, which was passed by the House of\r\nCommons, in spite of the protests of Sir Francis Burdett and Benjamin\r\nHobhouse. The measure was, however, dropped in the House of Lords in\r\nfavour of a more comprehensive Bill, applicable to all trades, which\r\nWhitbread had suggested. This was introduced on June 17, 1799, by\r\nWilliam Pitt himself, then Chancellor of the Exchequer, who referred\r\nto the alarming growth of combination, not merely in the Metropolis but\r\nalso in the north of England. Subsequent stages of the Bill were moved\r\nby George Rose, another member of the Administration; and the measure\r\nwas hurried through all its stages in both Houses with great rapidity,\r\nreceiving the Royal Assent only twenty-four days after its introduction\r\ninto the House of Commons. There was therefore little opportunity for\r\nany effective demonstration against its provisions, but the Journeymen\r\nCalico-printers’ Society of London petitioned against the measure, and\r\ninstructed counsel to put forward their objections. They represented\r\nthat, although the Bill professed merely “to prevent unlawful\r\ncombinations,” it created “new crimes of so indefinite a nature that no\r\none journeyman or workman will be safe in holding any conversation with\r\nanother on the subject of his trade or employment.” Only a few other\r\npetitions were presented, and, though Benjamin Hobhouse opposed it in\r\nthe Commons and Lord Holland in the Lords, the Bill passed unaltered\r\ninto law.[117]\r\n\r\nBut the struggle was not yet over. The employers were not satisfied\r\nwith the 1799 Act; and _The Times_ announced in January 1800 that “one\r\nof the first Acts of the Imperial Parliament [of the United Kingdom]\r\nwill be for the prevention of conspiracies among journeymen tradesmen\r\nto raise their wages. All benefit clubs and societies are to be\r\nimmediately suppressed.”[118] On the other hand, the trade clubs in\r\nall parts of the country poured in petitions of protest; and the Whig\r\nand Tory members for Liverpool, General Tarleton and Colonel Gascoyne,\r\namong whose constituents were the strongly combined shipwrights, who\r\nwere freemen and Parliamentary electors, united to bring in an amending\r\nBill. This was supported in a series of brilliant speeches by Sheridan,\r\nwhose attempts to reduce to a minimum the mischief of the 1799 Act were\r\nstrenuously resisted by Pitt and the Law Officers of the Crown. The\r\npetitions were considered by a Committee, which recommended certain\r\namendments. Two justices were substituted for one as the tribunal;\r\nno justice engaged in the same trade as the defendant could act;\r\nthe qualifying words “wilfully and maliciously” were introduced in\r\nthe description of the offences. A clause protecting trade friendly\r\nsocieties was proposed but eventually rejected. A particularly odious\r\nfeature of the 1799 Act, under which defendants were required to give\r\nevidence against themselves under severe penalties for refusal, was\r\nleft unaltered. A series of interesting clauses providing for the\r\nreference of wage disputes to arbitration--copied from the contemporary\r\nAct relating to the cotton trade[119]--aroused great opposition, as\r\ntending “to fix wages” and as involving the recognition of the Trade\r\nUnion representative, but they were finally adopted; without, so far as\r\nwe are aware, ever being put in force.[120]\r\n\r\nThe general Combination Act of 1800 was not merely the codification\r\nof existing laws, or their extension from particular trades to the\r\nwhole field of industry. It represented a new and momentous departure.\r\nHitherto the central or local authority had acted as a court of appeal\r\non all questions affecting the work and wages of the citizen. If the\r\nmaster and journeyman failed to agree as to what constituted a fair\r\nday’s wage for a fair day’s work, the higgling of the market was\r\nperemptorily superseded by the authoritative determination, presumably\r\non grounds of social expediency, of the standard of remuneration.\r\nProbably the actual fixing of wages by justices of the peace fell very\r\nrapidly into disuse as regards the majority of industries, although\r\nformal orders are found in the minutes of Quarter Sessions during\r\nthe first quarter of the nineteenth century, and deep traces of the\r\npractice long survived in the customary rates of hiring. Towards the\r\nend of the eighteenth century, at any rate, free bargaining between the\r\ncapitalist and his workmen became practically the sole method of fixing\r\nwages. Then it was that the gross injustice of prohibiting combinations\r\nof journeymen became apparent. “A single master,” said Lord Jeffrey,\r\n“was at liberty at any time to turn off the whole of his workmen at\r\nonce--100 or 1000 in number--if they would not accept of the wages he\r\nchose to offer. But it was made an offence for the whole of the workmen\r\nto leave that master at once if he refused to give the wages they\r\nchose to require.”[121] What was even more oppressive in practice was\r\nthe employers’ use of the threat of prosecution to prevent even the\r\nbeginnings of resistance among the workmen to any reduction of wages or\r\nworsening of conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is true that the law forbade combinations of employers as well as\r\ncombinations of journeymen. Even if it had been impartially carried\r\nout, there would still have remained the inequality due to the fact\r\nthat, in the new system of industry, a single employer was himself\r\nequivalent to a very numerous combination. But the hand of justice\r\nwas not impartial. The “tacit, but constant” combination of employers\r\nto depress wages, to which Adam Smith refers, could not be reached by\r\nthe law. Nor was there any disposition on the part of the magistrates\r\nor the judges to find the masters guilty, even in cases of flagrant or\r\navowed combination. No one prosecuted the master cutlers who, in 1814,\r\nopenly formed the Sheffield Mercantile and Manufacturing Union, having\r\nfor its main rule that no merchant or manufacturer should pay higher\r\nprices for any article of Sheffield make than were current in the\r\npreceding year, with a penalty of £100 for each contravention of this\r\nillegal agreement.[122] During the whole epoch of repression, whilst\r\nthousands of journeymen suffered for the crime of combination, there\r\nis no case on record in which an employer was punished for the same\r\noffence.\r\n\r\nTo the ordinary politician a combination of employers and a combination\r\nof workmen seemed in no way comparable. The former was, at most, an\r\nindustrial misdemeanour: the latter was in all cases a political crime.\r\nUnder the shadow of the French Revolution, the English governing\r\nclasses regarded all associations of the common people with the utmost\r\nalarm. In this general terror lest insubordination should develop into\r\nrebellion were merged both the capitalist’s objection to high wages and\r\nthe politician’s dislike of Democratic institutions. The Combination\r\nLaws, as Francis Place tells us, “were considered as absolutely\r\nnecessary to prevent ruinous extortions of workmen, which, if not\r\nthus restrained, would destroy the whole of the Trade, Manufactures,\r\nCommerce, and Agriculture of the nation.... This led to the conclusion\r\nthat the workmen were the most unprincipled of mankind. Hence the\r\ncontinued ill-will, suspicion, and in almost every possible way the\r\nbad conduct of workmen and their employers towards one another. So\r\nthoroughly was this false notion entertained that whenever men were\r\nprosecuted to conviction for having combined to regulate their wages\r\nor the hours of working, however heavy the sentence passed on them was,\r\nand however rigorously it was inflicted, not the slightest feeling of\r\ncompassion was manifested by anybody for the unfortunate sufferers.\r\nJustice was entirely out of the question: they could seldom obtain a\r\nhearing before a magistrate, never without impatience or insult; and\r\nnever could they calculate on even an approximation to a rational\r\nconclusion.... Could an accurate account be given of proceedings, of\r\nhearings before magistrates, trials at sessions and in the Court of\r\nKing’s Bench, the gross injustice, the foul invective, and terrible\r\npunishments inflicted would not, after a few years have passed away, be\r\ncredited on any but the best evidence.”[123]\r\n\r\nIt must not, however, be supposed that every combination was made the\r\nsubject of prosecution, or that the Trade Union leader of the period\r\npassed his whole life in gaol. Owing to the extremely inefficient\r\norganisation of the English police, and the absence of any public\r\nprosecutor, a combination was usually let alone until some employer\r\nwas sufficiently inconvenienced by its operations to be willing\r\nhimself to set the law in motion. In many cases we find employers\r\napparently accepting or conniving at their men’s combinations.[124]\r\nThe master printers in London not only recognised the very ancient\r\ninstitution of the “chapel,” but evidently found it convenient, at\r\nany rate from 1785 onwards, to receive and consider proposals from\r\nthe journeymen as an organised body. In 1804 we even hear of a joint\r\ncommittee consisting of an equal number of masters and journeymen,\r\nauthorised by their respective bodies to frame regulations for the\r\nfuture payment of labour, and resulting in the elaborate “scale” of\r\n1805, signed by both masters and men.[125] The London coopers had\r\na recognised organisation in 1813, in which year a list of prices\r\nwas agreed upon by representatives of the masters and men. This\r\nlist was revised in 1816 and 1819, without any one thinking of a\r\nprosecution.[126] The Trade Union was openly reformed in 1821 as the\r\nPhilanthropic Society of Coopers. The London brushmakers in 1805 had “A\r\nList of Prices agreed upon between the Masters and Journeymen,” which\r\nis still extant. The framework knitters, and also the tailors of the\r\nvarious villages in Nottinghamshire, were, from 1794 to 1810, in the\r\nhabit of freely meeting together, both masters and men, “to consider\r\nof matters relative to the trade,” the conferences being convened by\r\npublic advertisement.[127] The minute books of the local Trade Union\r\nof the carpenters of Preston for the years 1807 to 1824 chronicle an\r\napparently unconcealed and unmolested existence, in correspondence\r\nwith other carpenters’ societies throughout Lancashire. The accounts\r\ncontain no items for the expense of defending their officers against\r\nprosecutions, whereas there are several payments for advertisements\r\nand public meetings, and, be it added, a very large expenditure in\r\nbeer. And there is a lively tradition among the aged block printers\r\nof Glasgow that, in their fathers’ time, when their very active Trade\r\nUnion exacted a fee of seven guineas from each new apprentice, this\r\nmoney was always straightway drunk by the men of the print-field, the\r\nemployer taking his seat at the head of the table, and no work being\r\ndone by any one until the fund was exhausted. The calico-printers’\r\norganisation appears, at the early part of the nineteenth century, to\r\nhave been one of the strongest and most complete of the Unions. In\r\nan impressive pamphlet of 1815 the men are thus appealed to by the\r\nemployers: “We have by turns conceded what we ought all manfully to\r\nhave resisted, and you, elated with success, have been led on from\r\none extravagant demand to another, till the burden is become too\r\nintolerable to be borne. You fix the number of our apprentices, and\r\noftentimes even the number of our journeymen. You dismiss certain\r\nproportions of our hands, and will not allow others to come in their\r\nstead. You stop all Surface Machines, and go the length even to destroy\r\nthe rollers before our face. You restrict the Cylinder Machine, and\r\neven dictate the kind of pattern it is to print. You refuse, on urgent\r\noccasions, to work by candlelight, and even compel our apprentices\r\nto do the same. You dismiss our overlookers when they don’t suit\r\nyou; and force obnoxious servants into our employ. Lastly, you set\r\nall subordination and good order at defiance, and instead of showing\r\ndeference and respect to your employers, treat them with personal\r\ninsult and contempt.”[128] Notwithstanding all this, no systematic\r\nattempt appears to have been made to put down the calico-printers’\r\ncombination, and only one or two isolated prosecutions can be traced.\r\nIn Dublin, too, the cabinetmakers in the early part of the present\r\ncentury were combined in a strong union called the Samaritan Society,\r\nexclusively for trade purposes; “but though illegal, the employers\r\ndo not seem to have looked upon it with any great aversion; and when\r\non one occasion the chief constable had the men attending a meeting\r\narrested, the employers came forward to bail them. Indeed, they\r\nprofessed that their object, though primarily to defend their own\r\ninterests against the masters, was also to defend the interests of\r\nthe masters against unprincipled journeymen. Many of the masters on\r\nreceiving the bill of a journeyman were in the habit of sending it\r\nto the trades’ society committee to be taxed, after which the word\r\nCommittee was stamped upon it. One case was mentioned, when between\r\ntwo and three pounds were knocked off a bill of about eight pounds\r\nby the trade committee.”[129] And both in London and Edinburgh the\r\njourneymen openly published, without fear of prosecution, elaborate\r\nprinted lists of piecework prices, compiled sometimes by a committee\r\nof the men’s Trade Union, sometimes by a joint committee of employers\r\nand employed.[130] “The London Cabinetmakers’ Union Book of Prices,”\r\nof which editions were published in 1811 and 1824, was a costly\r\nand elaborate work, with many plates, published “by a Committee of\r\nMasters and Journeymen ... to prevent those litigations which have too\r\nfrequently existed in the trade.” Various supplements and “index keys”\r\nto this work were published; and other similar lists exist. So lax was\r\nthe administration of the law that George White, the energetic clerk to\r\nHume’s Committee, asserted that the Act of 1800 had “been in general a\r\ndead letter upon those artisans upon whom it was intended to have an\r\neffect--namely, the shoemakers, printers, papermakers, shipbuilders,\r\ntailors, etc., who have had their regular societies and houses of call,\r\nas though no such Act was in existence; and in fact it would be almost\r\nimpossible for many of those trades to be carried on without such\r\nsocieties, who are in general sick and travelling relief societies; and\r\nthe roads and parishes would be much pestered with these travelling\r\ntrades, who travel from want of employment, were it not for their\r\nsocieties who relieve what they call tramps.”[131]\r\n\r\nBut although clubs of journeymen might be allowed to take, like the\r\nLondon bookbinders, “a social pint of porter together,” and even, in\r\ntimes of industrial peace, to provide for their tramps and perform all\r\nthe functions of a Trade Union, the employers had always the power of\r\nmeeting any demands by a prosecution. Even those trades in which we\r\nhave discovered evidence of the unmolested existence of combinations\r\nfurnish examples of the rigorous application of the law. In 1819 we\r\nread of numerous prosecutions of cabinetmakers, hatters, ironfounders,\r\nand other journeymen, nominally for leaving their work unfinished,\r\nbut really for the crime of combination.[132] In 1798 five journeymen\r\nprinters were indicted at the Old Bailey for conspiracy. The employers\r\nhad sent for the men’s leaders to discuss their proposals, when, as\r\nit was complained, “the five defendants came, clothed as delegates,\r\nrepresenting themselves as the head of a Parliament as we may call it.”\r\nThe men were in fact members of a trade friendly society of pressmen\r\n“held at the Crown, near St. Dunstan’s Church, Fleet Street,” which, as\r\nthe prosecuting counsel declared, “from its appearance certainly bore\r\nno reproachable mark upon it. It was called a friendly society, but\r\nby means of some wicked men among them this society degenerated into\r\na most abominable meeting for the purpose of a conspiracy; those of\r\nthe trade who did not join their society were summoned, and even the\r\napprentices, and were told unless they conformed to the practices of\r\nthese journeymen, when they came out of their times they should not be\r\nemployed.” Notwithstanding the fact that the employers had themselves\r\nrecognised and negotiated with the society, the Recorder sentenced all\r\nthe defendants to two years’ imprisonment.[133]\r\n\r\nTwelve years later it was the brutality of another prosecution of\r\nthe compositors that impressed Francis Place with the necessity of\r\nan alteration in the law. “The cruel persecutions,” he writes, “of\r\nthe Journeymen Printers employed in _The Times_ newspaper in 1810\r\nwere carried to an almost incredible extent. The judge who tried and\r\nsentenced some of them was the Common Sergeant of London, Sir John\r\nSylvester, commonly known by the cognomen of ‘Bloody Black Jack.’... No\r\njudge took more pains than did this judge on the unfortunate printers,\r\nto make it appear that their offence was one of great enormity, to\r\nbeat down and alarm the really respectable men who had fallen into his\r\nclutches, and on whom he inflicted scandalously severe sentences.”[134]\r\nNor did prosecution always depend on the caprice of an employer. In\r\nDecember 1817 the Bolton constables, accidentally getting to know\r\nthat ten delegates of the calico-printers from the various districts\r\nof the kingdom were to meet on New Year’s Day, arranged to arrest the\r\nwhole body and seize all their papers. The ten delegates suffered\r\nthree months’ imprisonment, although no dispute with their employers\r\nwas in progress.[135] But the main use of the law to the employers\r\nwas to checkmate strikes, and ward off demands for better conditions\r\nof labour. Already, in 1786, the law of conspiracy had been strained\r\nto convict, and punish with two years’ imprisonment, the five London\r\nbookbinders who were leading a strike to reduce hours from twelve to\r\neleven.[136] When, at the Aberdeen Master Tailors’ Gild, in 1797, “it\r\nwas represented to the trade that their journeymen had entered into\r\nan illegal combination for the purpose of raising their wages,” the\r\nmasters unanimously “agreed not to give any additional wages to their\r\nservants,” and backed up this resolution of their own combination\r\nby getting twelve journeymen prosecuted and fined for the crime of\r\ncombining.[137] In 1799 the success of the London shoemakers in\r\npicketing obnoxious employers led to the prosecution of two of them,\r\nwhich was made the means of inducing the men to consent to dissolve\r\ntheir society, then seven years old, and return to work at once.[138]\r\nTwo other shoemakers of York were convicted in the same year for the\r\ncrime of “combining to raise the price of their labour in making\r\nshoes, and refusing to make shoes under a certain price,” and counsel\r\nsaid that “in every great town in the North combinations of this sort\r\nexisted.”[139] The coach-makers’ strike of 1819 was similarly stopped,\r\nand the “Benevolent Society of Coachmakers” broken up by the conviction\r\nof the general secretary and twenty other members, who were, upon\r\nthis condition, released on their own recognisances.[140] In 1819\r\nsome calico-engravers in the service of a Manchester firm protested\r\nagainst the undue multiplication of apprentices by their employers,\r\nand enforced their protest by declining to work. For this “conspiracy”\r\nthey were fined and imprisoned.[141] And though the master cutlers\r\nwere allowed, with impunity, to subscribe to the Sheffield Mercantile\r\nand Manufacturing Union, which fixed the rates of wages, and brought\r\npressure to bear on recalcitrant employers, the numerous trade clubs of\r\nthe operatives were not left unmolested. In 1816 seven scissor-grinders\r\nwere sentenced to three months’ imprisonment for belonging to what\r\nthey called the “Misfortune Club,” which paid out-of-work benefit, and\r\nsought to maintain the customary rates.[142]\r\n\r\nBut it was in the new textile industries that the weight of the\r\nCombination Laws was chiefly felt. White and Henson describe the Act of\r\n1800 as being in these trades “a tremendous millstone round the neck of\r\nthe local artisan, which has depressed and debased him to the earth:\r\nevery act which he has attempted, every measure that he has devised to\r\nkeep up or raise his wages, he has been told was illegal: the whole\r\nforce of the civil power and influence of the district has been exerted\r\nagainst him because he was acting illegally: the magistrates, acting,\r\nas they believed, in unison with the views of the legislature, to\r\ncheck and keep down wages and combination, regarded, in almost every\r\ninstance, every attempt on the part of the artisan to ameliorate his\r\nsituation or support his station in society as a species of sedition\r\nand resistance of the Government: every committee or active man among\r\nthem was regarded as a turbulent, dangerous instigator, whom it was\r\nnecessary to watch and crush if possible.”[143] To cite one only of\r\nthe instances, it was given in evidence before Hume’s Committee that\r\nin 1818 certain Bolton millowners suggested to the operative weavers\r\nthat they should concert together to leave the employment of those who\r\npaid below the current rate. Acting on this hint a meeting of forty\r\ndelegates took place, at which it was resolved to ask for the advance\r\nagreed to by the good employers. A fortnight later the president\r\nand the two secretaries were arrested, convicted of conspiracy,\r\nand imprisoned for one and two years respectively, although their\r\nemployers gave evidence on the prisoners’ behalf to the effect that\r\nthey had themselves requested the men to attend the meeting, and had\r\napproved the resolutions passed.[144] In the following year fifteen\r\ncotton-spinners of Manchester, who had met “to receive contributions to\r\nbury their dead,” under “Articles” sanctioned by Quarter Sessions in\r\n1795, were seized in the committee-room by the police, and committed to\r\ntrial for conspiracy, bail being refused. After three or four months’\r\nimprisonment they were brought to trial, the whole local bar--seven in\r\nnumber--being briefed against them. Collections were made in London and\r\nelsewhere (including the town of Lynn in Norfolk) for their defence.\r\nThe enrolment of their club as a friendly society availed little. It\r\nwas urged in court that “all societies, whether benefit societies or\r\notherwise, were only cloaks for the people of England to conspire\r\nagainst the State,” and most of the defendants were sentenced to\r\nvarying terms of imprisonment.[145]\r\n\r\nBut the Scottish Weavers’ Strike of 1812, described in the preceding\r\nchapter, is the most striking case of all. In the previous year certain\r\ncotton-spinners had been convicted of combination and imprisoned,\r\nthe judge observing that there was a clear remedy in law, as the\r\nmagistrates had full power and authority to fix rates of wages or\r\nsettle disputes. In 1812 many of the employers refused to accept the\r\nrates which the justices had declared as fair for weaving; and all\r\nthe weavers at the forty thousand looms between Aberdeen and Carlisle\r\nstruck to enforce the justices’ rates. The employers had already\r\nmade overtures through the sheriff of the county for a satisfactory\r\nsettlement when the Government arrested the central committee of\r\nfive, who were directing the proceedings. These men were sentenced\r\nto periods of imprisonment varying from four to eighteen months; the\r\nstrike failed, and the association broke up.[146] The student of the\r\nnewspapers between 1800 and 1824 will find abundant record of judicial\r\nbarbarities, of which the cases cited above may be taken as samples.\r\nNo statistics exist as to the frequency of the prosecutions or the\r\nseverity of the sentences; but it is easy to understand, from such\r\nreports as are available, the sullen resentment which the working class\r\nsuffered under these laws. Their repeal was a necessary preliminary\r\nto the growth among the most oppressed sections of the workers of any\r\nreal power of protecting themselves, by Trade Union effort, against the\r\ndegradation of their Standard of Life.\r\n\r\nThe failure of the Combination Laws to suppress the somewhat\r\ndictatorial Trade Unionism of the skilled handicraftsmen, and their\r\nefficacy in preventing the growth of permanent Unions among other\r\nsections of the workers, is explained by class distinctions, now\r\npassed away or greatly modified, which prevailed at the beginning of\r\nthe present century. To-day, when we speak of “the aristocracy of\r\nlabour” we include under that heading the organised miners and factory\r\noperatives of the North on the same superior footing as the skilled\r\nhandicraftsman. In 1800 they were at opposite extremes of the social\r\nscale in the wage-earning class, the weaver and the miner being then\r\nfurther removed from the handicraftsman than the docker or general\r\nlabourer is from the Lancashire cotton-spinner or Northumberland\r\nhewer of to-day. The skilled artisans formed, at any rate in London,\r\nan intermediate class between the shopkeeper and the great mass of\r\nunorganised labourers or operatives in the new machine industries.\r\nThe substantial fees demanded all through the eighteenth century for\r\napprenticeship to the “crafts” had secured to the members and their\r\neldest sons a virtual monopoly.[147] Even after the repeal of the laws\r\nrequiring a formal apprenticeship some time had to elapse before the\r\nsupply of this class of handicraftsmen overtook the growing demand.\r\nThus we gather from the surviving records that these trades have\r\nnever been more completely organised in London than between 1800 and\r\n1820.[148] We find the London hatters, coopers, curriers, compositors,\r\nmillwrights, and shipwrights maintaining earnings which, upon their\r\nown showing, amounted to the comparatively large sum of thirty to\r\nfifty shillings per week. At the same period the Lancashire weaver\r\nor the Leicester hosier, in full competition with steam-power and\r\nits accompaniment of female and child labour, could, even when fully\r\nemployed, earn barely ten shillings. We see this difference in the\r\nStandard of Life reflected in the characters of the combinations formed\r\nby the two classes.\r\n\r\nIn the skilled handicrafts, long accustomed to corporate government,\r\nwe find, even under repressive laws, no unlawful oaths, seditious\r\nemblems, or other common paraphernalia of secret societies. The\r\nLondon Brushmakers, whose Union apparently dates from the early\r\npart of the eighteenth century, expressly insisted “that no person\r\nshall be admitted a member who is not well affected to his present\r\nMajesty and the Protestant Succession, and in good health and of a\r\nrespectable character.” But this loyalty was not inconsistent with\r\ntheir subscribing to the funds of the 1831 agitation for the Reform\r\nBill.[149] The prevailing tone of the superior workmen down to 1848\r\nwas, in fact, strongly Radical; and their leaders took a prominent part\r\nin all the working-class politics of the time. From their ranks came\r\nsuch organisers as Place, Lovett, and Gast.[150] But wherever we have\r\nbeen able to gain any idea of their proceedings, their trade clubs were\r\nfree from anything that could now be conceived as political sedition.\r\nIt was these clubs of handicraftsmen that formed the backbone of the\r\nvarious “central committees” which dealt with the main topics of Trade\r\nUnionism during the next thirty years. They it was who furnished such\r\nassistance as was given by working men to the movement for the repeal\r\nof the Combination Laws. And their influence gave a certain dignity and\r\nstability to the Trade Union Movement, without which, under hostile\r\ngovernments, it could never have emerged from the petulant rebellions\r\nof hunger-strikes and machine-breaking.\r\n\r\nThe principal effect of the Combination Laws on these well-organised\r\nhandicrafts in London, Liverpool, Dublin, and perhaps other towns,\r\nwas to make the internal discipline more rigid and the treatment of\r\nnon-unionists more arbitrary. Place describes how “in these societies\r\nthere are some few individuals who possess the confidence of their\r\nfellows, and when any matter relating to the trade has been talked\r\nover, either at the club or in a separate room, or in a workshop or a\r\nyard, and the matter has become notorious, these men are expected to\r\ndirect what shall be done, and they do direct--simply by a hint. On\r\nthis the men act; and one and all support those who may be thrown out\r\nof work or otherwise inconvenienced. If matters were to be discussed\r\nas gentlemen seem to suppose they must be, no resolution would ever be\r\ncome to. The influence of the men alluded to would soon cease if the\r\nlaw were repealed. It is the law and the law alone which causes the\r\nconfidence of the men to be given to their leaders. Those who direct\r\nare not known to the body, and not one man in twenty, perhaps, knows\r\nthe person of any one who directs. It is a rule among them to ask no\r\nquestions, and another rule among them who know most, either to give no\r\nanswer if questioned, or an answer to mislead.”[151]\r\n\r\nIn the new machine industries, on the other hand, the repeated\r\nreductions of wages, the rapid alterations of processes, and the\r\nsubstitution of women and children for adult male workers, had\r\ngradually reduced the workers to a condition of miserable poverty.\r\nThe reports of Parliamentary committees, from 1800 onward, contain a\r\ndreary record of the steady degradation of the Standard of Life in the\r\ntextile industries. “The sufferings of persons employed in the cotton\r\nmanufacture,” Place writes of this period, “were beyond credibility:\r\nthey were drawn into combinations, betrayed, prosecuted, convicted,\r\nsentenced, and monstrously severe punishments inflicted on them: they\r\nwere reduced to and kept in the most wretched state of existence.”[152]\r\nTheir employers, instead of being, as in the older handicrafts, little\r\nmore than master workmen, recognising the customary Standard of Life\r\nof their journeymen, were often capitalist _entrepreneurs_, devoting\r\ntheir whole energies to the commercial side of the business, and\r\nleaving their managers to buy labour in the market at the cheapest\r\npossible rate. This labour was recruited from all localities and many\r\ndifferent occupations. It was brigaded and controlled by despotic\r\nlaws, enforced by numerous fines and disciplinary deductions. Cases of\r\ngross tyranny and heartless cruelty are not wanting. Without a common\r\nstandard, a common tradition, or mutual confidence, the workers in\r\nthe new mills were helpless against their masters. Their ephemeral\r\ncombinations and frequent strikes were, as a rule, only passionate\r\nstruggles to maintain a bare subsistence wage. In place of the steady\r\norganised resistance to encroachments maintained by the handicraftsmen,\r\nwe watch, in the machine industries, the alternation of outbursts of\r\nmachine-breaking and outrages, with intervals of abject submission and\r\nreckless competition with each other for employment. In the conduct\r\nof such organisation as there was, repressive laws had, with the\r\noperatives as with the London artisans, the effect of throwing great\r\npower into the hands of a few men. These leaders were implicitly obeyed\r\nin times of industrial conflict, but the repeated defeats which they\r\nwere unable to avert prevented that growth of confidence which is\r\nindispensable for permanent organisation.[153] Both leaders and rank\r\nand file, too, were largely implicated in political seditions, and were\r\nthe victims of spies and Ministerial emissaries of all sorts. All these\r\ncircumstances led to the prevalence among them of fearful oaths, mystic\r\ninitiation rites, and other manifestations of a sensationalism which\r\nwas sometimes puerile and sometimes criminal.\r\n\r\nThe most notorious of these “seditions,” about which little is really\r\nknown, was the “Luddite” upheaval of 1811-12, when riotous mobs of\r\nmanual workers, acting under some sort of organisation, went about\r\ndestroying textile machinery and sometimes wrecking factories. To what\r\nextent this had any direct connection with the Trade Union Movement\r\nseems to us, pending more penetrating investigation of the unpublished\r\nevidence, somewhat uncertain. That the operatives very generally\r\nsympathised with the most violent protest against the displacement\r\nof hand labour by machinery, and the extreme distress which it was\r\ncausing, is clear. The Luddite movement apparently began among the\r\nFramework-knitters, who had long been organised in local clubs, with\r\nsome rudimentary federal bond; and the whole direction of the Luddites\r\nwas often ascribed, as by the Mayor of Leicester in 1812, to “the\r\nCommittee of Framework-knitters, who have as complete an organisation\r\nof the whole body as you could have of a regiment.”[154] But money\r\nwas collected from men of other trades, notably bricklayers, masons,\r\nspinners, weavers, and colliers, as well as from the soldiers in some\r\nof the regiments stationed at provincial centres; and such evidence\r\nas we have found points rather to a widespread secret oath-bound\r\nconspiracy, not of the men of any one trade, but of wage-earners of all\r\nkinds. We find an informer stating (June 22, 1812), with what truth\r\nwe know not, “that the Union extends from London to Nottingham, and\r\nfrom thence to Manchester and Carlisle. Small towns lying between the\r\nprincipal places are not yet organised, such as Garstang and Burton.\r\nOnly some of the trades have taken the first oath. He says there is a\r\nsecond oath taken by suspicious persons.”[155] On the other hand, it\r\nlooks as if the various local Trade Clubs were made use of, in some\r\ncases informally, as agents or branches of the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nGeneral Maitland, writing from Buxton (June 22, 1812) to the Home\r\nSecretary, says that, in his opinion, “the whole of this business ...\r\noriginated in those constant efforts made by these associations for\r\nmany years past to keep up the price of the manufacturers’ wages; that\r\nfinding their efforts for this unavailing, both from the circumstances\r\nof the trade and the high price of provisions, they in a moment of\r\nirritation, for which it is but just to say they had considerable\r\nground from the real state of distress in which they were placed ...\r\nbegan to think of effecting that by force which they had ever been\r\ntrying to do by other means; and that in this state the oath was\r\nintroduced.... I believe the whole to be, certainly a most mischievous,\r\nbut undefined and indistinct attempt to be in a state of preparation to\r\ndo that by force which they had not succeeded in carrying into effect\r\nas they usually did by other means.” The whole episode has been too\r\nmuch ignored, even by social historians; and “Byron’s famous speech and\r\nCharlotte Brontë’s more famous novel give to most people their idea\r\nof the misery of the time, and of its cause, the displacement of hand\r\nlabour by machinery.”[156]\r\n\r\nThe coal-miners were in many respects even worse off than the hosiery\r\nworkers and the cotton weavers. In Scotland they had been but lately\r\nfreed from actual serfdom, the final act of emancipation not having\r\nbeen passed until 1799. In Monmouthshire and South Wales the oppression\r\nof the “tommy shops” of the small employers was extreme. In the North\r\nof England the “yearly bond,” the truck system, and the arbitrary\r\nfines kept the underground workers in complete subjection. The result\r\nis seen in the turbulence of their frequent “sticks” or strikes, during\r\nwhich troops were often required to quell their violence. The great\r\nstrike of 1810 was carried on by an oath-bound confederacy recruited\r\nby the practice of “brothering,” “so named because the members of the\r\nunion bound themselves by a most solemn oath to obey the orders of the\r\nbrotherhood, under the penalty of being stabbed through the heart or of\r\nhaving their bowels ripped up.”[157]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these differences between various classes of workers,\r\nthe growing sense of solidarity among the whole body of wage-earners\r\nrises into special prominence during this period of tyranny and\r\nrepression. The trades in which it was usual for men to tramp from\r\nplace to place in search of employment had long possessed, as we have\r\nseen, some kind of loose federal organisation extending throughout\r\nthe country. In spite of the law of 1797 forbidding the existence\r\nof “corresponding societies,” the various federal organisations of\r\nCurriers, Hatters, Calico-printers, Woolcombers, Woolstaplers, and\r\nother handicraftsmen kept up constant correspondence on trade matters,\r\nand raised money for common trade purposes. In some cases there existed\r\nan elaborate national organisation, with geographical districts\r\nand annual delegate meetings; like that of the Calico-printers who\r\nwere arrested by the Bolton constables in 1818. The rules of the\r\nPapermakers,[158] which certainly date from 1803, provide for the\r\ndivision of England into five districts, with detailed arrangements\r\nfor representation and collective action. This national organisation\r\nwas, notwithstanding repressive laws, occasionally very effective. We\r\nneed cite only one instance, furnished by the Liverpool Ropemakers in\r\n1823. When a certain firm attempted to put labourers to the work, the\r\nlocal society of ropespinners informed it that this was “contrary to\r\nthe regulations of the trade,” and withdrew all their members. The\r\nemployers, failing to get men in Liverpool, sent to Hull and Newcastle,\r\nbut found that the Ropespinners’ Society had already apprised the local\r\ntrade clubs at those towns. The firm then imported “blacklegs” from\r\nGlasgow, who were met on arrival by the local unionists, inveigled\r\nto a “trade club-house,” and alternately threatened and cajoled out\r\nof their engagements. Finally the head of the firm went to London to\r\npurchase yarn; but the London workmen, finding that the yarn was for\r\na “struck shop,” refused to complete the order. The last resource of\r\nthe employers was an indictment at the Sessions for combination, but a\r\nLiverpool jury, in the teeth of the evidence and the judge’s summing\r\nup, gave a verdict of acquittal.[159]\r\n\r\nThis solidarity was not confined to the members of a particular\r\ntrade. The masters are always complaining that one trade supports\r\nanother, and old account books of Trade Unions for this period abound\r\nwith entries of sums contributed in aid of disputes in other trades,\r\neither in the same town or elsewhere. Thus the small society of London\r\nGoldbeaters, during the three years 1810-12, lent or gave substantial\r\nsums, amounting in all to £200, to fourteen other trades.[160] The Home\r\nSecretary was informed in 1823 that a combination of cotton-spinners\r\nat Bolton, whose books had been seized, had received donations,\r\nnot only from twenty-eight cotton-spinners’ committees in as many\r\nLancashire towns, but also from fourteen other trades, from coal-miners\r\nto butchers.[161] A picturesque illustration of this brotherly help\r\nin need occurs in the account of an appeal to the Pontefract Quarter\r\nSessions by certain Sheffield cutlers against their conviction for\r\ncombination: “The appellants were in court, but hour after hour passed,\r\nand no counsel moved the case. The reason was a want of funds for the\r\npurpose. At last, whilst in court, a remittance from the clubs in\r\nManchester, to the amount of one hundred pounds, arrived, and then the\r\ncounsel was fee’d, and the case, which, but for the arrival of the\r\nmoney from this town, must have dropped in that stage, was proceeded\r\nwith.”[162] And although the day of Trades Councils had not yet come,\r\nit was a common thing for the various trade societies of a particular\r\ntown to unite in sending witnesses to Parliamentary Committees,\r\npreparing petitions to the House of Commons and paying counsel to\r\nsupport their case, engaging solicitors to prosecute offending\r\nemployers, and collecting subscriptions for strikes.[163] This tendency\r\nto form joint committees of local trades was, as we shall see, greatly\r\nstrengthened in the agitation against the Combination Laws from\r\n1823-25. With the final abandonment of all legislative protection of\r\nthe Standard of Life, and the complete divorce of the worker from the\r\ninstruments of production, the wage-earners in the various industrial\r\ncentres became indeed ever more conscious of the widening of the old\r\nseparate trade disputes into “the class war” which has characterised\r\nthe past century.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to-day to realise the naïve surprise with which\r\nthe employers of that time regarded the practical development of\r\nworking-class solidarity. The master witnesses before Parliamentary\r\nCommittees, and the judges in sentencing workmen for combination,\r\nare constantly found reciting instances of mutual help to prove the\r\nexistence of a widespread “conspiracy” against the dominant classes.\r\nThat the London Tailors should send money to the Glasgow Weavers, or\r\nthe Goldbeaters to the Ropespinners, seemed to the middle and upper\r\nclasses little short of a crime.\r\n\r\nThe movement for a repeal of the Combination Laws began in a period of\r\nindustrial dislocation and severe political repression. The economic\r\nresults of the long war, culminating in the comparatively low prices\r\nof the peace for most manufactured products, though not for wheat,\r\nled in 1816 to an almost universal reduction of wages throughout the\r\ncountry. In open defiance of the law the masters, in many instances,\r\ndeliberately combined in agreements to pay lower rates. This agreement\r\nwas not confined to the employers in a particular trade, who may have\r\nbeen confronted by organised bodies of journeymen, but extended, in\r\nsome cases, to all employers of labour in a particular locality. The\r\nlandowners and farmers of Tiverton, for instance, at a “numerous and\r\nrespectable meeting at the Town Hall” in 1816, resolved “that, in\r\nconsequence of the low price of provisions,” not more than certain\r\nspecified wages should be given to smiths, carpenters, masons,\r\nthatchers, or masons’ labourers.[164] The Compositors, Coopers,\r\nShoemakers, Carpenters, and many other trades record serious reductions\r\nof wages at this period. In these cases the masters justified their\r\naction on the ground that, owing to the fall of prices, the Standard\r\nof Life of the journeymen would not be depressed. But in the great\r\nstaple industries there ensued a cutting competition between employers\r\nto secure orders in a falling market, their method being to undersell\r\neach other by beating down wages below subsistence level--an operation\r\noften aided by the practice, then common, of supplementing insufficient\r\nearnings out of the Poor Rate. This produced such ruinous results that\r\nlocal protests were soon made. At Leicester the authorities decided\r\nto maintain the men’s “Statement Price” by agreeing to wholly support\r\nout of a voluntary fund those who could not get work at the full\r\nrates. This was bitterly resented by the neighbouring employers, who\r\nseriously contemplated indicting the lord-lieutenant, mayor, alder-men,\r\nclergy, and other subscribers for criminal conspiracy to keep up\r\nwages.[165] And in 1820 a public meeting of the ratepayers of Sheffield\r\nprotested against the “evil of parish pay to supplement earnings,” and\r\nrecommended employers to revert to the uniform price list which the\r\nmen had gained in 1810.[166] Finally we have the employers themselves\r\npublicly denouncing the ruinous extent to which the cutting of wages\r\nhad been carried. A declaration dated June 16, 1819, and signed by\r\nfourteen Lancashire manufacturers, regrets that they have been\r\ncompelled by the action of a few competitors to lower wages to the\r\npresent rates, and strongly condemns any further reduction; whilst\r\ntwenty-five of the most eminent calico-printing firms append an\r\nemphatic approval of the protest, and state “that the system of paying\r\nsuch extremely low wages for manufacturing labour is injurious to the\r\ntrade at large.”[167] At Coventry the ribbon manufacturers combined\r\nwith the Weavers’ Provident Union to maintain a general adherence to\r\nthe agreed list of prices, and in 1819 subscribed together no less\r\nthan £16,000 to cover the cost of proceedings with this object. This\r\ncombination formed the subject of an indictment at Warwick Assizes,\r\nwhich put an end to the association, the remaining funds being handed\r\nover to the local “Streets Commissioners” for paving the city. These\r\nprotests and struggles of the better employers were in vain. Rates\r\nwere reduced and strikes occurred all over the country, and were met,\r\nnot by redress or sympathy, but by an outburst of prosecutions and\r\nsentences of more than the usual ferocity. The common law and ancient\r\nstatutes were ruthlessly used to supplement the Combination Acts,\r\noften by strained constructions. The Scotch judges in particular, as\r\nan eminent Scotch jurist declared to the Parliamentary Committee in\r\n1824, applied the criminal procedure of Scotland to cases of simple\r\ncombination, from 1813-19, in a way that he, on becoming Lord Advocate,\r\nrefused to countenance.[168] The workers, on attempting some spasmodic\r\npreparations for organised political agitation, were further coerced,\r\nin 1819, by the infamous “Six Acts,” which at one blow suppressed\r\npractically all public meetings, enabled the magistrate to search\r\nfor arms, subjected all working-class publications to the crushing\r\nstamp duty, and rendered more stringent the law relating to seditious\r\nlibels. The whole system of repression which had characterised the\r\nstatesmanship of the Regency culminated at this period in a tyranny\r\nnot exceeded by any of the monarchs of the “Holy Alliance.” The effect\r\nof this tyranny was actually to shield the Combination Laws by turning\r\nthe more energetic and enlightened working-class leaders away from\r\nall specific reforms to a thorough revolution of the whole system of\r\nParliamentary representation. Hence there was no popular movement\r\nwhatever for the repeal of the Combination Laws. If we were writing\r\nthe history of the English working class instead of that of the Trade\r\nUnion Movement, we should find in William Cobbett or “Orator” Hunt, in\r\nSamuel Bamford or William Lovett, a truer representative of the current\r\naspirations of the English artisan at this time than in the man who\r\nnow came unexpectedly on the scene to devise and carry into effect the\r\nTrade Union Emancipation of 1824.\r\n\r\nFrancis Place was a master tailor who had created a successful business\r\nin a shop at Charing Cross. Before setting up for himself he had worked\r\nas a journeyman breeches-maker, and had organised combinations in his\r\nown and other trades. After 1818 he left the conduct of the business to\r\nhis son, and devoted his keenly practical intellect and extraordinary\r\npersistency first to the repeal of the Combination Laws, and next to\r\nthe Reform Movement. In social theory he was a pupil of Bentham and\r\nJames Mill, and his ideal may be summed up as political Democracy\r\nwith industrial liberty, or, as we should now say, thoroughgoing\r\nRadical Individualism. No one who has closely studied his life and\r\nwork will doubt that, within the narrow sphere to which his unswerving\r\npracticality confined him, he was the most remarkable politician of\r\nhis age. His chief merit lay in his thorough understanding of the\r\nart of getting things done. In agitation, permeation, wire-pulling,\r\nParliamentary lobbying, the drafting of resolutions, petitions, and\r\nbills--in short, of all those artifices by which a popular movement is\r\nfirst created and then made effective on the Parliamentary system--he\r\nwas an inventor and tactician of the first order. Above all, he\r\npossessed in perfection the rare quality of permitting other people to\r\ncarry off the credit of his work, and thus secured for his proposals\r\nwilling promoters and supporters, some of the leading Parliamentary\r\nfigures of the time owing all their knowledge on his questions to\r\nthe briefs with which he supplied them. The invaluable collection of\r\nmanuscript records left by him, now in the British Museum, prove that\r\nmodesty had nothing to do with his contemptuous readiness to leave the\r\ntrophies of victory to his pawns provided his end was attained. He was\r\nthoroughly appreciative of the fact that in every progressive movement\r\nhis shop at Charing Cross was the real centre of power when the\r\nParliamentary stage of a progressive movement was reached. It remained,\r\nfrom 1807 down to about 1834, the recognised meeting-place of all the\r\nagitators of the time.[169]\r\n\r\nIt was in watching the effect of the Combination Laws in his own\r\ntrade that Place became converted to their repeal. The special laws\r\nof 1720 and 1767, fixing the wages of journeymen tailors, as well\r\nas the general law of 1800 against all combinations, had failed to\r\nregulate wages, to prevent strikes, or to hinder those masters who\r\nwished in times of pressure to engage skilled men, from offering the\r\nbribe of high piecework rates, or even time wages in excess of the\r\nlegal limit. Place gave evidence as a master tailor before the Select\r\nCommittee of the House of Commons which inquired into the subject in\r\n1810; and it was chiefly his weighty testimony in favour of freedom of\r\ncontract that averted the fresh legal restrictions which a combination\r\nof employers was then openly promoting.[170] This experience of the\r\npractical freedom of employers to combine intensified Place’s sense\r\nof the injustice of denying a like freedom to the journeymen, whilst\r\nthe brutal prosecution of the compositors of the _Times_ in the same\r\nyear brought home to his mind the severity of the law. Four years\r\nlater (1814), as he himself tells us, he “began to work seriously to\r\nprocure a repeal of the laws against combinations of workmen, but\r\nfor a long time made no visible progress.” The employers were firmly\r\nconvinced that combinations of wage-earners would succeed in securing\r\na great rise of wages, to the serious detriment of profits. Far from\r\ncontemplating a repeal of the Act of 1800, they were in 1814 and 1816\r\npestering the Home Secretary for legislation of greater stringency\r\nas the only safeguard for their “freedom of enterprise.”[171] The\r\npoliticians were equally certain that Trade Union action would\r\nraise prices, and thus undermine the foreign trade upon which the\r\nprosperity and international influence of England depended. The\r\nworking men themselves afforded in the first instance no assistance.\r\nThose who had suffered legal prosecution were hopeless of redress\r\nfrom an unreformed Parliament, and offered no support. One trade,\r\nthe Spitalfields silk-weavers, supported the Government because they\r\nenjoyed what they deemed to be the advantage of legal protection from\r\nthe lowering of wages by competition.[172] Others were suspicious of\r\nthe intervention of one who was himself an employer, and who had not\r\nyet gained recognition as a friend to labour. But Place was undismayed\r\nby hostility and indifference. Knowing that with an English public\r\nthe strength of his cause would lie, not in any abstract reasoning\r\nor appeal to natural rights, but in an enumeration of actual cases\r\nof injustice, he made a point of obtaining the particulars of every\r\ntrade dispute. He intervened, as he says, in every strike, sometimes\r\nas a mediator, sometimes as an ally of the journeymen. He opened up a\r\nvoluminous correspondence with Trade Unions throughout the kingdom,\r\nand wrote innumerable letters to the newspapers. In 1818 he secured a\r\nuseful medium in the _Gorgon_,[173] a little working-class political\r\nnewspaper, started by one Wade, a woolcomber, and subsidised by Bentham\r\nand Place himself. This gained him his two most important disciples,\r\neventually the chief instruments of his work, J. R. McCulloch and\r\nJoseph Hume. McCulloch, afterwards to gain fame as an economist, was\r\nat that time the editor of the _Scotsman_, perhaps the most important\r\nof the provincial newspapers. A powerful article based on Place’s\r\nfacts which he contributed to the _Edinburgh Review_ in 1823 secured\r\nmany converts; and his constant advocacy gave Place’s idea a weight\r\nand notoriety which it had hitherto lacked. Joseph Hume was an even\r\nmore important ally. His acknowledged position in the House of Commons\r\nas one of the leaders of the growing party of Philosophic Radicalism\r\ngained for the repeal movement a steadily increasing support with\r\nadvanced members of Parliament. Among a certain section in the House\r\nthe desirability of freedom of combination began to be discussed;\r\npresently it was considered practicable; and soon many came to regard\r\nit as an inevitable outcome of their political creed. In 1822 Place\r\nthought the time ripe for action; and Hume accordingly gave notice\r\nof his intention to bring in a Bill to repeal all the laws against\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nPlace’s manuscripts and letters contain a graphic account of the\r\nwire-pullings and manipulations of the next two years.[174] In these\r\ncontemporary pictures of the inner workings of the Parliamentary\r\nsystem we watch Hume cajoling Huskisson and Peel into granting him a\r\nSelect Committee, staving off the less tactful proposals of a rival\r\nM.P.,[175] and finally, in February 1824, packing the Committee of\r\nInquiry at length appointed. Hume, with some art, had included in\r\nhis motion three distinct subjects--the emigration of artisans, the\r\nexportation of machinery and combinations of workmen, all of which were\r\nforbidden by law. To Place and Hume the repeal of the Combination Laws\r\nwas the main object; but Huskisson and his colleagues regarded the\r\nCommittee as primarily charged with an inquiry into the possibility of\r\nencouraging the rising manufacture of machinery, which was seriously\r\nhampered by the prohibition of sales to foreign countries. Huskisson\r\ntried to induce Hume to omit from the Committee’s reference all mention\r\nof the Combination Laws, evidently regarding them as only a minor and\r\nunimportant part of the inquiry. But Place and Hume were now masters\r\nof the situation; and for the next few months they devoted their whole\r\ntime to the management of the Committee. At first no one seems to have\r\nhad any idea that its proceedings were going to be of any moment; and\r\nno trouble was taken by the Ministry with regard to its composition.\r\n“It was with difficulty,” writes Place, “that Mr. Hume could obtain\r\nthe names of twenty-one members to compose the Committee; but when it\r\nhad sat three days, and had become both popular and amusing, members\r\ncontrived to be put upon it; and at length it consisted of forty-eight\r\nmembers.”[176] Hume, who was appointed chairman, appears to have\r\ntaken into his own hands the entire management of the proceedings. A\r\ncircular explaining the objects of the inquiry was sent to the mayor\r\nor other public officer of forty provincial towns, and appeared in the\r\nprincipal local newspapers. Public meetings were held at Stockport\r\nand other towns to depute witnesses to attend the Committee.[177]\r\nMeanwhile Place, who had by this time acquired the confidence of the\r\nchief leaders of the working class, secured the attendance of artisan\r\nwitnesses from all parts of the kingdom. Read in the light of Place’s\r\nprivate records and daily correspondence with Hume, the proceedings of\r\nthis “Committee on Artisans and Machinery” reveal an almost perfect\r\nexample of political manipulation. Although no hostile witness was\r\ndenied a hearing, it was evidently arranged that the employers who\r\nwere favourable to repeal should be examined first, and that the\r\npreponderance of evidence should be on their side. And whilst those\r\ninterests which would have been antagonistic to the repeal were neither\r\nprofessionally represented nor deliberately organised, the men’s case\r\nwas marshalled with admirable skill by Place, and fully brought out\r\nby Hume’s examination. Thus the one acted as the Trade Unionists’\r\nParliamentary solicitor, and the other as their unpaid counsel.[178]\r\n\r\nPlace himself tells us how he proceeded: “The delegates from the\r\nworking people had reference to me, and I opened my house to them.\r\nThus I had all the town and country delegates under my care. I heard\r\nthe story which every one of these men had to tell, I examined and\r\ncross-examined them, took down the leading particulars of each case,\r\nand then arranged the matter as briefs for Mr. Hume, and as a rule, for\r\nthe guidance of the witnesses, a copy was given to each.... Each brief\r\ncontained the principal questions and answers.... That for Mr. Hume was\r\ngenerally accompanied by an appendix of documents arranged in order,\r\nwith a short account of such proceedings as were necessary to put Mr.\r\nHume in possession of the whole case. Thus he was enabled to go on with\r\nconsiderable ease, and to anticipate or rebut objections.”[179]\r\n\r\nThe Committee sat in private; but Hume’s numerous letters to Place show\r\nhow carefully the latter was kept posted up in all the proceedings:\r\n“As the proceedings of the Committee were printed from day to day\r\nfor the use of the members, I had a copy sent to me by Mr. Hume,\r\nwhich I indexed on paper ruled in many columns, each column having an\r\nappropriate head or number. I also wrote remarks on the margins of the\r\nprinted evidence; this was copied daily by Mr. Hume’s secretary, and\r\nthen returned to me. This consumed much time, but enabled Mr. Hume to\r\nhave the whole mass constantly under his view; and I am very certain\r\nthat less pains and care would not have been sufficient to have carried\r\nthe business through.”[180]\r\n\r\nFrom Westminster Hall we are transported, by these private notes for\r\nHume’s use, all now preserved in the British Museum, into the back\r\nparlour of the Charing Cross shop, where the London and provincial\r\nartisan witnesses came for their instructions. “The workmen,” as\r\nPlace tells us, “were not easily managed. It required great care and\r\npains not to shock their prejudices so as to prevent them doing\r\ntheir duty before the Committee. They were filled with false notions,\r\nall attributing their distresses to wrong causes, which I, in this\r\nstate of the business, dared not attempt to remove. Taxes, machinery,\r\nlaws against combinations, the will of the masters, the conduct of\r\nmagistrates--these were the fundamental causes of all their sorrows and\r\nprivations.... I had to discuss everything with them most carefully,\r\nto arrange and prepare everything, and so completely did these things\r\noccupy my time that for more than three months I had hardly any\r\nrest.”[181]\r\n\r\nThe result of the inquiry was as Hume and Place had ordained. A series\r\nof resolutions in favour of complete freedom of combination and liberty\r\nof emigration was adopted by the Committee, apparently without dissent.\r\nA Bill to repeal all the Combination Laws and to legalise trade\r\nsocieties was passed through both Houses, within less than a week, at\r\nthe close of the session, without either debate or division. Place and\r\nHume contrived privately to talk over and to silence the few members\r\nwho were alive to the situation; and the measure passed, as Place\r\nremarks, “almost without the notice of members within or newspapers\r\nwithout.”[182] So quietly was the Bill smuggled through Parliament that\r\nthe magistrates at a Lancashire town unwittingly sentenced certain\r\ncotton-weavers to imprisonment for combination some weeks after the\r\nlaws against that crime had been repealed.[183]\r\n\r\nPlace and Hume had, however, been rather too clever. Whilst the\r\ngoverning classes were quite unconscious that any important alteration\r\nof law or policy had taken place, the unlooked-for success of Place’s\r\nagitation produced, as Nassau Senior describes, “a great moral effect”\r\nin all the industrial centres. “It confirmed in the minds of the\r\noperatives the conviction of the justice of their cause, tardily and\r\nreluctantly, but at last fully, conceded by the Legislature. That\r\nwhich was morally right in 1824 must have been so, they would reason,\r\nfor fifty years before.... They conceived that they had extorted from\r\nthe Legislature an admission that their masters must always be their\r\nrivals, and had hitherto been their oppressors, and that combinations\r\nto raise wages, and shorten the time or diminish the severity of\r\nlabour, were not only innocent, but meritorious.”[184] Trade Societies\r\naccordingly sprang into existence or emerged into aggressive publicity\r\non all sides. A period of trade inflation, together with a rapid rise\r\nin the price of provisions, favoured a general increase of wages. For\r\nthe next six months the newspapers are full of strikes and rumours of\r\nstrikes. Serious disturbances occurred at Glasgow, where the employers\r\nhad been exceptionally oppressive, where the cotton operatives\r\ncommitted several outrages, and where a general lock-out took place.\r\nThe cotton-spinners were once more striking in the Manchester district.\r\nThe shipping trade of the North-East Coast was temporarily paralysed by\r\na strong combination of the seamen on the Tyne and Wear, who refused\r\nto sail except with Unionist seamen and Unionist officers. The Dublin\r\ntrades, then the best organised in the kingdom, ruthlessly enforced\r\ntheir bye-laws for the regulation of their respective industries, and\r\nformed a joint committee, the so-called “Board of Green Cloth,” whose\r\ndictates became the terror of the employers. The Sheffield operatives\r\nhave to be warned that, if they persist in demanding double the former\r\nwages for only three days a week work, the whole industry of the town\r\nwill be ruined.[185] The London shipwrights insisted on what their\r\nemployers considered the preposterous demand for a “book of rates”\r\nfor piecework. The London coopers demanded a revision of their wages,\r\nwhich led to a long-sustained conflict. In fact, as a provincial\r\nnewspaper remarked a little later, “it is no longer a particular class\r\nof journeymen at some single point that have been induced to commence\r\na strike for an advance of wages, but almost the whole body of the\r\nmechanics in the kingdom are combined in the general resolution to\r\nimpose terms on their employers.”[186]\r\n\r\nThe opening of the session of 1825 found the employers throughout\r\nthe country thoroughly aroused. Hume and Place had in vain preached\r\nmoderation, and warned the Unions of the danger of a reaction. The\r\ngreat shipowning and shipbuilding interest, which had throughout the\r\ncentury preserved intact its reputation for unswerving hostility to\r\nTrade Unionism, had possession of the ear of Huskisson, then President\r\nof the Board of Trade and member for Liverpool. Early in the session he\r\nmoved for a committee of inquiry into the conduct of the workmen and\r\nthe effect of the recent Act, which, he complained, had been smuggled\r\nthrough the House without his attention having been called to the fact\r\nthat it went far beyond the mere repeal of the special statutes against\r\ncombinations.[187] This time the composition of the committee was not\r\nleft to chance, or to Hume’s manipulation. The members were, as Place\r\ncomplains, selected almost exclusively from the Ministerial benches,\r\ntwelve out of the thirty being placemen, and many being representatives\r\nof rotten boroughs. Huskisson,[188] Peel, and the Attorney-General\r\nthemselves took part in its proceedings; Wallace, the Master of the\r\nMint, was made chairman, and Hume alone represented the workmen.\r\nHuskisson regarded the Committee as merely a formal preliminary to the\r\nintroduction of the Bill which the shipping interest had drafted,[189]\r\nunder which Trade Unions, and even Friendly Societies, would have been\r\nimpossible. For the inner history of this Committee we have to rely on\r\nPlace’s voluminous memoranda, and Hume’s brief notes to him. According\r\nto these, the original intention was to call only a few employers as\r\nwitnesses, to exclude all testimony on the other side, and promptly to\r\nreport in favour of the repressive measure already prepared. Place,\r\nhimself an expert in such tactics, met them by again supplying Hume\r\ndaily with detailed information which enabled him to cross-examine the\r\nmasters and expose their exaggerations. And, if Place’s account of the\r\nanimus of the Committee and the Ministers against himself be somewhat\r\nhighly coloured, we have ample evidence of the success with which he\r\nguided the alarmed Trade Unions to take effectual action in their own\r\ndefence. His friend John Gast, secretary to the London Shipwrights,\r\ncalled for two delegates from each trade in the metropolis, and\r\nformed a committee which kept up a persistent agitation against any\r\nre-enactment of the Combination Laws. Similar committees were formed\r\nat Manchester and Glasgow by the cotton operatives, at Sheffield\r\nby the cutlers, and at Newcastle by the seamen and shipwrights.\r\nPetitions, the draft of which appears in Place’s manuscripts, poured\r\nin to the Select Committee and to both Houses. If we are to believe\r\nPlace, the passages leading to the committee-room were carefully kept\r\nthronged by crowds of workmen insisting on being examined to rebut the\r\naccusations of the employers, and waylaying individual members to whom\r\nthey explained their grievances. All this energy on the part of the\r\nUnions was, as Place observes, in marked contrast with their apathy\r\nthe year before. The workmen, though they had done nothing to gain\r\ntheir freedom of association, were determined to maintain it. Doherty,\r\nthe leader of the Lancashire Cotton-spinners, writing to Place in the\r\nheat of the agitation, declared that any attempt at a re-enactment\r\nof the Combination Laws would result in a widespread revolutionary\r\nmovement.[190] The net result of the inquiry was, on the whole,\r\nsatisfactory. The Select Committee found themselves compelled to hear\r\na certain number of workmen witnesses, who testified to the good\r\nresults of the Act of the previous year. The ship-owners’ Bill was\r\nabandoned, and the House of Commons was recommended to pass a measure\r\nwhich nominally re-established the general common-law prohibition of\r\ncombinations, but specifically excepted from prosecution associations\r\nfor the purpose of regulating wages or hours of labour. The master\r\nshipbuilders were furious at this virtual defeat. The handbill is still\r\nextant which they distributed at the doors of the House of Commons\r\non the day of the second reading of the emasculated Bill.[191] They\r\ndeclared that its provisions were quite insufficient to save their\r\nindustry from destruction. If Trade Unions were to be allowed to exist\r\nat all, they demanded that these bodies should be compelled to render\r\nfull accounts of their expenditure to the justices in Quarter Sessions,\r\nand that any diversion of monies raised for friendly society purposes\r\nshould be severely punished. They pleaded, moreover, that at any rate\r\nall federal or combined action among trade clubs should be prohibited.\r\nPlace and Hume, on the other hand, were afraid, and subsequent events\r\nproved with what good grounds, that the narrow limits of the trade\r\ncombinations allowed by the Bill, and still more the vague terms\r\n“molest” and “obstruct,” which it contained, would be used as weapons\r\nagainst Trade Unionism. The Government, however, held to the draft\r\nof the Committee. The shipbuilders secured nothing. Hume induced\r\nMinisters to give way on some verbal points, and took three divisions\r\nin vain protest against the measure. Place carried on the agitation to\r\nthe House of Lords, where Lord Rosslyn extracted the concession of a\r\nright of appeal to Quarter Sessions, which was afterwards to prove of\r\nsome practical value.\r\n\r\nThe Act of 1825 (6 Geo. IV. c. 129)[192]--which became known among the\r\nmanufacturers as “Peel’s Act”--though it fell short of the measure\r\nwhich Place and Hume had so skilfully piloted through Parliament the\r\nyear before, effected a real emancipation. The right of collective\r\nbargaining, involving the power to withhold labour from the market by\r\nconcerted action, was for the first time expressly established. And\r\nalthough many struggles remained to be fought before the legal freedom\r\nof Trade Unionism was fully secured, no overt attempt has since been\r\nmade to render illegal this first condition of Trade Union action.[193]\r\n\r\nIt is a suggestive feature of this, as of other great reforms, that\r\nthe men whose faith in its principle, and whose indefatigable industry\r\nand resolution carried it through, were the only ones who proved\r\naltogether mistaken as to its practical consequences. If we read the\r\nlesson of the century aright, the manufacturer was not wholly wrong\r\nwhen he protested that liberty of combination must make the workers\r\nthe ultimate authority in industry, although his narrow fear as to the\r\ndriving away of capital and commercial skill and the reduction of the\r\nnation to a dead level of anarchic pauperism were entirely contradicted\r\nby subsequent developments. And the workman, to whom liberty to combine\r\nopened up vistas of indefinite advancement of his class at the expense\r\nof his oppressors, was, we now see, looking rightly forward, though he,\r\ntoo, greatly miscalculated the distance before him, and overlooked many\r\narduous stages of the journey. But what is to be said of the forecasts\r\nof Place and the Philosophic Radicals? “Combinations,” writes Place to\r\nSir Francis Burdett in 1825, “will soon cease to exist. Men have been\r\nkept together for long periods only by the oppressions of the laws;\r\nthese being repealed, combinations will lose the matter which cements\r\nthem into masses, and they will fall to pieces. All will be as orderly\r\nas even a Quaker could desire.... He knows nothing of the working\r\npeople who can suppose that, when left at liberty to act for themselves\r\nwithout being driven into permanent associations by the oppression\r\nof the laws, they will continue to contribute money for distant and\r\ndoubtful experiments, for uncertain and precarious benefits. If let\r\nalone, combinations--excepting now and then, and for particular\r\npurposes under peculiar circumstances--will cease to exist.”[194]\r\n\r\nIt is pleasant to feel that Place was right in regarding the repeal as\r\nbeneficial and worthy of his best efforts in its support; but in every\r\nless general respect he and his allies were as wrong as it was possible\r\nfor them to be. The first disappointment, however, came to the workmen.\r\nOver and over again they had found their demands for higher wages\r\nparried only by the employers’ resort to the law, and they now saw\r\nthe way clear before them for an organised attack upon their masters’\r\nprofits. Trades which had not yet enjoyed permanent combinations began\r\nto organise in the expectation of raising their wages to the level of\r\nthose of their more fortunate brethren. The Sheffield shop-assistants\r\ncombined to petition for early closing.[195] The cotton-weavers of\r\nLancashire met in delegate meeting at Manchester in August 1824 to\r\nestablish a permanent organisation to prevent reductions in prices\r\nand to secure a uniform wage, the notice stating that it was by\r\ntheir secret combinations that the tailors, joiners, and spinners had\r\nsucceeded in keeping up wages.[196] In the same month the Manchester\r\ndyers turned out for an advance, and paraded the streets, which they\r\nhad placarded with their proposals.[197] The Glasgow calender-men\r\nstruck for a regular twelve hours’ day, and carried their point. The\r\nsuccess of the shipwrights on the north-east coast[198] induced the\r\nLondon shipwrights to convert their “Committee for conducting the\r\nBusiness in the North” into the “Shipwrights’ Provident Union of the\r\nPort of London,” which existed continuously until its absorption in the\r\ntwentieth century by the national society dominating the trade.\r\n\r\n“Such is the rage for union societies,” reports the _Sheffield Iris_ of\r\nJuly 12, 1825, “that the sea apprentices in Sunderland have actually\r\nhad regular meetings every day last week on the moor, and have\r\nresolved not to go on board their ships unless the owners will allow\r\nthem tea and sugar.” Local trade clubs expanded, like the Manchester\r\nSteam-Engine Makers’ Society, into national organisations. In other\r\ncases corresponding clubs developed into federal bodies. The object in\r\nall these cases was the same. The preamble to the first rules of the\r\nFriendly Society of Operative House Carpenters and Joiners of Great\r\nBritain, which was established by a delegate meeting in London in\r\n1827, states that, “for the amelioration of the evils attendant on our\r\ntrade, and the advancement of the rights and privileges of labour,” it\r\nwas considered “absolutely necessary that a firm compact of interests\r\nshould exist between the whole of the operative carpenters and joiners\r\nthroughout the United Kingdom of Great Britain.”[199]\r\n\r\nNor was it only in the multiplication of trade societies that the\r\nexpansion showed itself. A committee of delegates from the London\r\ntrades meeting during the summer of 1825 set on foot the _Trades\r\nNewspaper and Mechanics’ Weekly Journal_, a sevenpenny stamped paper,\r\nwith the motto, “They helped every one his neighbour, and every one\r\nsaid to his brother, ‘Be of good cheer.’”[200] A vigorous attempt\r\nwas made to promote Trade Union organisation in all industries, and\r\nto bring to bear a body of instructed working-class opinion upon the\r\npolitical situation of the day.[201]\r\n\r\nThe high hopes of which all this exultant activity was the symptom\r\nwere soon rudely dashed. The year 1825 closed with a financial panic\r\nand widespread commercial disaster. The four years that followed were\r\nyears of contraction and distress. Hundreds of thousands of workmen in\r\nall trades lost their employment, and wages were reduced all round. In\r\nmany manufacturing districts the operatives were kept from starvation\r\nonly by public subscriptions.[202] Strikes under these circumstances\r\nended invariably in disaster. A notable stand made by the Bradford\r\nwoolcombers and weavers in 1825 resulted in complete defeat and the\r\nbreak-up of the Union.[203]\r\n\r\nDuring the greater part of the following year all Lancashire was\r\nconvulsed by incessant strikes of coal-miners and textile workers\r\nagainst the repeated reductions of wages to which the employers\r\nresorted--strikes which were marred by serious disorder, the\r\ndestruction of many hundreds of looms, and severe repression by the\r\ntroops.[204]\r\n\r\nAt Kidderminster, three years later, practically the whole trade\r\nof the town was brought to a standstill by the carpet-weavers’ six\r\nmonths’ resistance to a reduction of 17 per cent in their wages[205]--a\r\nresistance in which the operatives received the sympathy and support\r\nof many who did not belong to their class. In the same year the\r\nsilk-weavers of London and other towns maintained an embittered\r\nresistance to a further cut at wages.[206] The emancipated combinations\r\nwere no more able to resist reductions than the secret ones had been,\r\nand in some instances the workmen again resorted to violence and\r\nmachine-breaking.\r\n\r\nFor a moment the repeal seemed, after all, to have done nothing but\r\nprove the futility of mere sectional combination, and the working men\r\nturned back again from Trade Union action to the larger aims and wider\r\ncharacter of the Radical and Socialistic agitations of the time, with\r\nwhich, from 1829 to 1842, the Trade Union Movement became inextricably\r\nentangled. This is the phase which furnishes the theme of the following\r\nchapter.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[111] An elaborate account of this legislation will be found in _Labour\r\nLegislation, Labour Movements, and Labour Leaders_, by G.

There is evidence of at least one other club of painters in\r\nLondon dating back to the eighteenth century, the “Original Society of\r\nPainters and Glaziers” existing in 1779, which afterwards became the\r\nSt. Martin’s Society of Painters and Glaziers (_Beehive_, October 24,\r\n1863).\r\n\r\n[113] This term was used to denote men who had not served a legal\r\napprenticeship.

For other\r\nboys, especially for the sons of parents not belonging to the trade, a\r\nfee of £5 to £20 was exacted by the employer. The secretary of the Old\r\nAmicable Society of Woolstaplers thirty years ago informed us that, as\r\nhis brother had already entered the trade, his father had to pay £100\r\nfor his indentures.\r\n\r\n[148] To take, for instance, the cabinetmakers and millwrights. When\r\nLovett came to London in 1819 he found that he could not get employment\r\nwithout joining the Union (_Life of William Lovett_, by himself).\r\nThe millwrights at the beginning of the century were so strongly\r\norganised--this probably led to the engineering employers’ petition\r\nin 1799 out of which the Combination Acts sprang--that when Fairbairn\r\n(after being actually engaged at Rennie’s works) was refused admission\r\ninto their society, he was driven to tramp out of London in search\r\nof work in a non-union district (_Life of Sir William Fairbairn_, by\r\nhimself, 1877, pp. 89, 92). For the last three-quarters of the century\r\na considerable proportion of the cabinetmakers and engineers employed\r\nin London have been outside the Trade Union ranks.\r\n\r\n[149] _Articles of the Society of Journeymen Brushmakers, held at the\r\nsign of the Craven Head, Drury Lane_, 1806; Minutes, April 27, 1831.\r\n\r\n[150] John Gast, a shipwright of Deptford, was evidently one of the\r\nablest Trade Unionists of his time. We first hear of him in 1802, when\r\nthere was a serious strike in London that attracted the attention\r\nof the Government (Home Office Papers in Record Office, 65--1, July\r\nand August 1802), as the author of a striking pamphlet entitled _A\r\nVindication of the Conduct of the Shipwrights during the late disputes\r\nwith their Employers_ (1802, 38 pp.). In 1818 he is found advocating\r\nthe first recorded proposal for a general workmen’s organisation,\r\nas distinguished from separate trade clubs--to be described in our\r\nnext chapter; and his _Articles of the Philanthropic Hercules for\r\nthe Mutual Support of the Labouring Mechanics_, which were printed\r\nin the _Gorgon_, attracted the attention of Francis Place, who\r\ndescribed him (Place MSS, 27819--23) as having “long been secretary\r\nto the Shipwrights’ Club: he was a steady, respectable man. He had\r\nformed several associations of working men, but had been unable\r\nto keep up any one of them.” He became one of Place’s most useful\r\nallies in the agitation for a repeal of the Combination Laws, and\r\nwhen, in 1825, their re-enactment was threatened, his “committee of\r\ntrades delegates” was Place’s strongest support. Gast was the leading\r\nspirit in the establishment of the _Trades Newspaper_ in July 1825,\r\nand became chairman of the committee of management, as well as a\r\nfrequent contributor. In the same year he was actively engaged in\r\nthe shipwrights’ struggle for a “Book of Rates,” or definite list of\r\npiecework prices, and the energy with which he counteracted the design\r\nof the Board of Admiralty, of allowing the London shipbuilders to\r\nborrow men from the Portsmouth Navy Yard, contributed mainly to the\r\nsuccess of the fight.\r\n\r\n[151] Place MSS. 27800--195.\r\n\r\n[152] Place MSS. 27798--11; and _The Town Labourer, 1760-1832_, by J.\r\nL. and B.

Between 1798-1803 and 1804-16 the piecework\r\nwages for handloom cotton weaving were reduced in some cases by 80 per\r\ncent at a time of war prices (_Geschichte der englischen Lohnarbeit_,\r\nby Gustav Steffen, Stuttgart, 1900, vol. ii. pp. 19-20).

Howell, 1902,\r\npp. 43-57.\r\n\r\n[175] In 1823 George White, a “clerk of committees” of the House\r\nof Commons, had formed an alliance with Gravener Henson, the\r\nbobbin-net maker of Nottingham, who had long been a leader of the\r\nframework-knitters’ combinations, to whom reference has been made in\r\npreceding pages. Together they prepared an elaborate Bill repealing\r\nall the Combination Acts, and substituting a complicated machinery\r\nfor regulating piecework and settling industrial disputes. Some of\r\nthese proposals were meritorious anticipations of subsequent factory\r\nlegislation; but the time was not ripe for such measures. This Bill,\r\npromptly introduced by Peter Moore, the member for Coventry, had the\r\neffect of scaring some timid legislators, and especially alarming the\r\nFront Bench. Hume was at a loss to know how to act; but Place, in\r\na letter displaying great political sagacity, advised him to baulk\r\nthe rival Bill by putting its author on the Committee of Inquiry,\r\nexplaining that “Moore is not a man to be put aside. The only way to\r\nput him down is to let him talk his nonsense in the Committee, where,\r\nbeing outvoted, he will be less of an annoyance in the House.” See\r\nPlace MSS. 27798--12.\r\n\r\n[176] Place MSS. 27798--30.\r\n\r\n[177] This attracted the attention of the Home Secretary (Home Office\r\nPapers, 40--18).\r\n\r\n[178] Place offered to act as Hume’s “assistant”; but the members of\r\nthe Committee, whose suspicions had been aroused, refused to permit him\r\nto remain in the room, on the double ground that he was not a member of\r\nthe House, nor even a gentleman!\r\n\r\n[179] Place MSS. 27798--22.\r\n\r\n[180] _Ibid._ 27798--23.\r\n\r\n[181] Place MS. 27798--22.\r\n\r\n[182] The Act was 5 George IV. c. 95.

We have by anticipation applied the term\r\nTrade Union to them in its modern sense; but in no case that we have\r\ndiscovered did they call themselves so. It is in the leading articles\r\nof the newspapers of 1830-4 that we first come upon references to\r\nsome great Power of Darkness vaguely described as “the Trades Union.”\r\nWe find, moreover, that there was in that day, as there has been\r\nrepeatedly since, an Old Unionism and a New Unionism, and that “the\r\nTrades Union” represented the New Unionism, and the trade club, or\r\nTrade Union, as we have called it, the Old. The distinction between a\r\nTrade Union and a Trades Union is exactly that which the names imply.\r\nA Trade Union is a combination of the members of one trade; a Trades\r\nUnion is a combination of different trades. “_The_ Trades Union,” the\r\nbugbear of the _Times_ in 1834, means the ideal at which the Trades\r\nUnionists aimed: that is, a complete union of all the workers in the\r\ncountry in a single national Trades Union. The peculiar significance\r\nof Trades Union as distinguished from Trade Union must be carefully\r\nborne in mind throughout this chapter, as it has passed out of use and\r\noccurs now only as a literary blunder. Our present unions of workers\r\nin different though related trades are usually called Amalgamations or\r\nFederations. But both Amalgamations and Federations, being definitely\r\nlimited to similar or related and interdependent trades, are in idea\r\nessentially Trade Unions. The distinctive connotation of the term\r\nTrades Union was the ideal of complete solidarity of all wage-workers\r\nin “One Big Union”--that is to say, a single “universal” organisation.\r\nIt is the attempt, on the part of the Trade Union leaders, to form not\r\nonly national societies of particular trades, but also to include all\r\nmanual workers in one comprehensive organisation, that constitutes the\r\nNew Unionism of 1829-34.[207]\r\n\r\nWe are not altogether without information as to the genesis of the\r\nidea. The first attempt at a General Trades Union of which we have\r\nany record is that of the “Philanthropic Society” or “Philanthropic\r\nHercules” of 1818. This we hear of almost simultaneously in Manchester,\r\nthe Potteries and London, though it seems to have originated in\r\nfirst-named town. A meeting of workmen of various trades, held at\r\nManchester in August 1818, convinced of the impotence of isolated\r\nTrade Clubs, sought to establish a society on a federal basis, each\r\nconstituent trade raising its own funds and separately moving for\r\nadvances or resisting reductions; but pledged first to consult the\r\ncommittee and the other trades, and promised the support of all,\r\nboth in approved trade movements and in case of legal prosecution or\r\noppression. A committee of eleven was to be chosen by ballot, one-third\r\nretiring monthly by rotation; and was to be assisted by a similar local\r\norganisation in each town.[208] How far the “General Union,” as the\r\n“Philanthropic Society” seems also to have been called, got under way\r\nin Lancashire or Staffordshire remains uncertain; but in London the\r\nidea was taken up by one of the ablest Trade Unionists of the time--the\r\nshipwright John Gast, whom we have already mentioned as an ally of\r\nFrancis Place, who became president and called upon “the general body\r\nof mechanics” to subscribe a penny per week to a central fund for the\r\ndefence of their common interests.[209]\r\n\r\nWhether anything came of the attempts at a General Union in 1818-19 we\r\nhave not discovered, but in all probability the project immediately\r\nfailed. Seven years later a similar effort met with no greater\r\nsuccess. “In 1826,” as we incidentally learn from a subsequent Labour\r\njournal,[210] “a Trades Union was formed in Manchester, which extended\r\nslightly to some of the surrounding districts, and embraced several\r\ntrades in each; but it expired before it was so much as known a large\r\nmajority of the operatives in the neighbourhood.”\r\n\r\nWhat was aimed at is clear enough. It was being recommended to the\r\nworkmen by some of their intellectual advisers. An able pamphlet of\r\n1827 tells them that “Against the competition of the underpaid of\r\nsurrounding trades, the ready remedy is a central union of all the\r\ngeneral unions of all the trades of the country. The remuneration of\r\nall the different branches of artisans and mechanics in the country\r\nmight then be fixed at those rates which would leave such an equalised\r\nremuneration to all as would take away any temptation from those in one\r\nbranch to transfer their skill in order to undersell the labour of the\r\nwell-remunerated in another branch: the Central Union fund being always\r\nready to assist the unemployed in any particular branch, when their own\r\nlocal and general funds were exhausted; provided always their claims to\r\nsupport were by the Central Union deemed to be just.”[211]\r\n\r\nExperience seems to show that national organisation of particular\r\ntrades must precede the formation of any General Trades Union; and\r\nit was in this way that the project now took form. In 1829 we see\r\nrenewed attempts at national organisation, in which the Lancashire\r\nand Yorkshire textile and building operatives were pioneers. The year\r\n1829, closing the long depression of trade which began in the autumn\r\nof 1825, after the repeal of the Combination Laws, witnessed the\r\nestablishment of important national Unions in both industries, but that\r\nof the Cotton-spinners claims precedence in respect of its more rapid\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe Cotton-spinners’ trade clubs of Lancashire date apparently from\r\n1792, and they spread, within a generation, to thirty or forty towns,\r\nremaining always strictly local organisations. In the early years of\r\nthe nineteenth century attempts had been made by the Glasgow Spinners\r\nto unite the Lancashire and Scottish organisations in a national\r\nassociation; but these attempts had not resulted in more than temporary\r\nalliances in particular emergencies. The rapid improvement of spinning\r\nmachinery, and the enterprise of the Lancashire millowners, were, at\r\nthe date of the repeal of the Combination Laws, shifting the centre\r\nof the trade from Glasgow to Manchester; and it was the Lancashire\r\nCotton-spinners who now took the lead in trade matters. The failure\r\nof a disastrous six months’ strike in 1829 at Hyde, near Manchester,\r\nled to the conviction that no local Union could succeed against a\r\ncombination of employers; and the spinners’ societies of England,\r\nScotland, and Ireland were therefore invited to send delegates to a\r\nconference to be held at Ramsay, in the Isle of Man, in the month of\r\nDecember 1829.\r\n\r\nThis delegate meeting, of which there is an excellent report,[212]\r\nlasted for nearly a week. The proceedings were of a remarkably\r\ntemperate character, the discussions turning chiefly on the relative\r\nadvantages of one supreme executive to be established at Manchester,\r\nand three co-equal national executives for England, Scotland, and\r\nIreland. No secrecy was attempted. John Doherty,[213] secretary\r\nand leader of the Manchester Cotton-spinners, advocated a central\r\nexecutive; while Thomas Foster (a man of independent means who\r\nattended the conference at his own expense) favoured a scheme of home\r\nrule. Eventually a “Grand General Union of the United Kingdom” was\r\nestablished, subject to an annual delegate meeting and three national\r\ncommittees. The union was to include all male spinners and piecers, the\r\nwomen and girls being urged to form separate organisations, which were\r\nto receive all the aid of the whole confederation in supporting them\r\nto obtain “men’s prices.” The union was to promote local action for a\r\nfurther legislative restriction of the hours of labour, to apply to all\r\npersons under 21 years of age. Its income consisted of a contribution\r\nof a penny per week per member, to be levied in addition to the\r\ncontribution to the local society. Doherty was general secretary, and\r\nFoster and a certain Patrick McGowan were appointed to organise the\r\nspinners throughout the United Kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Boroughreeve and Constables of Manchester, on May 26, 1830,\r\nwrote in alarm to Sir Robert Peel: “The combination of workmen, long\r\nacknowledged a great evil, and one most difficult to counteract, has\r\nrecently assumed so formidable and systematic a shape in this district\r\nthat we feel it our duty to lay before you some of its most alarming\r\nfeatures.... A committee of delegates from the operative spinners of\r\nthe three Kingdoms have established an annual assembly in the Isle\r\nof Man to direct the proceedings of the general body towards their\r\nemployers, the orders for which they promulgate to their respective\r\ndistricts and subcommittees. To these orders the most implicit\r\ndeference is shown; and a weekly levy or rent of one penny per head\r\non each operative is cheerfully paid. This produces a large sum,\r\nand is a powerful engine, and principally to support those who have\r\nturned out against their employers, agreeable to the orders of the\r\ncommittee, at the rate of ten shillings per week for each person. The\r\nplan of a general turnout having been found to be impolitic, they have\r\nemployed it in detail, against particular individuals or districts,\r\nwho, attacked thus singly, are frequently compelled to submit to their\r\nterms rather than to the ruin which would ensue to many by allowing\r\ntheir machinery (in which their whole capital is invested) to stand\r\nidle.”[214]\r\n\r\nWhether this Cotton-spinners’ Federation, as we should call it, became\r\nreally representative of the three kingdoms does not appear. A second\r\ngeneral delegate meeting was held at Manchester in December 1830,\r\nwhich intervened in the great spinners’ strike then in progress at\r\nAshton-under-Lyne. At this conference the constitution of 1829 was\r\nre-enacted with some alterations. The three national executives were\r\napparently replaced by an executive council of three members elected\r\nby the Manchester Society, to be reinforced at its monthly meetings by\r\ntwo delegates chosen in turn by each of the neighbouring districts.\r\nA general delegate meeting seems also to have been held, attended by\r\none delegate from each of the couple of scores of towns in which there\r\nwere local clubs.[215] Foster was appointed general secretary; and a\r\ncommittee was ordered to draw up a general list of prices, for which\r\npurpose one member in each mill was directed to send up a copy of the\r\nlist by which he was paid. Although another delegate meeting of this\r\n“Grand General Union” was fixed for Whit Monday 1831 at Liverpool, no\r\nfurther record of its existence can be traced. It is probable that the\r\nattempt to include Scotland and Ireland proved a failure, and that the\r\nunion had dwindled into a federation of Lancashire societies, mainly\r\npreoccupied in securing a legislative restriction of the hours of\r\nlabour.[216]\r\n\r\nBut the National Union of Cotton-spinners prepared the way for the\r\nmore ambitious project of the Trades Union. Doherty, who seems to have\r\nresigned his official connection with the Cotton-spinners’ Union,\r\nconceived the idea of a National Association, not of one trade alone,\r\nbut of all classes of wage-earners. Already in May 1829 we find him,\r\nas Secretary of the Manchester Cotton-spinners, writing to acknowledge\r\na gift of ten pounds from the Liverpool Sailmakers, and expressing “a\r\nhope that our joint efforts may eventually lead to a Grand General\r\nUnion of all trades throughout the United Kingdom.”[217] At his\r\ninstigation a meeting of delegates from twenty organised trades was\r\nheld at Manchester in February 1830, which ended in the establishment,\r\nfive months later, of the National Association for the Protection of\r\nLabour. The express object of this society was to resist reductions,\r\nbut not to strike for advances. In an eloquent address to working\r\nmen of all trades, the new Association appealed to them to unite for\r\ntheir own protection and in order to maintain “the harmony of society”\r\nwhich is destroyed by their subjection. How is it, the Association\r\nasks, that whilst everything else increases--knowledge, wealth,\r\ncivil and religious liberty, churches, madhouses, and prisons--the\r\ncircumstances of the working man become ever worse? “He, the sole\r\nproducer of food and raiment, is, it appears, destined to sink whilst\r\nothers rise.” To prevent this evil the Association is formed.[218]\r\nIts constitution appears to have been largely borrowed from that\r\nof the contemporary Cotton-spinners, which it resembled in being a\r\ncombination, not of directly enlisted individuals, but of existing\r\nseparate societies, each of which paid an entrance fee of a pound,\r\ntogether with a shilling for each of its members, and contributed at\r\nthe rate of a penny per week per head of its membership. Doherty was\r\nthe first secretary, and the Association appears very soon to have\r\nenrolled about 150 separate Unions, mostly in Lancashire, Cheshire,\r\nDerby, Nottingham, and Leicester. The trades which joined were mainly\r\nconnected with the various textile industries--the cotton-spinners,\r\nhosiery-workers, calico-printers, and silk-weavers taking a leading\r\npart. The Association also included numerous societies of mechanics,\r\nmoulders, black-smiths, and many miscellaneous trades. The building\r\ntrades were scarcely represented--a fact to be accounted for by the\r\ncontemporary existence of the Builders’ Union hereafter described.\r\nThe list[219] of the receipts of the Association for the first nine\r\nmonths of its existence includes payments amounting to £1866, a sum\r\nwhich indicates a membership of between 10,000 and 20,000, spread over\r\nthe five counties already mentioned. A vigorous propaganda was carried\r\non throughout the northern and midland counties by its officials,\r\nwho succeeded in establishing a weekly paper, the _United Trades\r\nCo-operative Journal_, which was presently brought to an end by the\r\nintervention of the Commissioners of Stamps, who insisted on each\r\nnumber bearing a fourpenny stamp.[220] Undeterred by this failure, the\r\ncommittee undertook the more serious task of starting a sevenpenny\r\nstamped weekly, and requested Francis Place to become the treasurer\r\nof an accumulated fund. “The subscription,” writes Place to John Cam\r\nHobhouse, December 5, 1830, “extends from Birmingham to the Clyde; the\r\ncommittee sits at Manchester; and the money collected amounts to about\r\n£3000, and will, they tell me, shortly be as much as £5000, with which\r\nsum, when raised, they propose to commence a weekly newspaper to be\r\ncalled the _Voice of the People_.” Accordingly in January 1831 appeared\r\nthe first number of what proved to be an excellent weekly journal, the\r\nobject of which was declared to be “to unite the productive classes of\r\nthe community in one common bond of union.” Besides full weekly reports\r\nof the committee meetings of the National Association at Manchester and\r\nNottingham, this newspaper, ably edited by John Doherty, gave great\r\nattention to Radical politics, including the Repeal of the Union with\r\nIreland, and the progress of revolution on the Continent.[221]\r\n\r\nFrom the reports published in the _Voice of the People_ we gather\r\nthat the first important action of the Association was in connection\r\nwith the almost continuous strikes of the cotton-spinners at\r\nAshton-under-Lyne, which flamed up into a sustained conflict on a large\r\nscale, during which Ashton, a young millowner, was murdered by some\r\nunknown person in the winter of 1830-31, in resistance to a new list\r\nof prices arbitrarily imposed by the Association of Master Spinners in\r\nAshton, Dukinfield, and Stalybridge.[222] Considerable sums were raised\r\nby way of levy for the support of the strike, the Nottingham trades\r\nsubscribing liberally. But the Association soon experienced a check. In\r\nFebruary 1831 a new secretary decamped with £100. This led a delegate\r\nmeeting at Nottingham, in April 1831, to decree that each Union should\r\nretain in hand the money contributed by its own members. But the usual\r\nfailings of unions of various trades quickly showed themselves. The\r\nrefusal of the Lancashire branches to support the great Nottingham\r\nstrike which immediately ensued led to the defection of the Nottingham\r\nmembers. Nevertheless the Association was spreading over new ground.\r\nWe hear of delegates from Lancashire inducing thousands of colliers\r\nin Derbyshire to join, whilst other trades, and even the agricultural\r\nlabourers, were talking about it.[223] At the end of April a\r\ndelegate meeting at Bolton, representing nine thousand coalminers\r\nof Staffordshire, Yorkshire, Cheshire, and Wales, resolved to join.\r\nThe Belfast trades applied for affiliation. In Leeds nine thousand\r\nmembers were enrolled, chiefly among the woollen-workers. Missionaries\r\nwere sent to organise the Staffordshire potters; and a National\r\nPotters’ Union, extending throughout the country, was established\r\nand affiliated. All this activity lends a certain credibility to the\r\nassertion, made in various quarters, that the Association numbered one\r\nhundred thousand members, and that the _Voice of the People_, published\r\nat 7d. weekly, enjoyed the then enormous circulation of thirty thousand.\r\n\r\nHere at last we have substance given to the formidable idea of “the\r\nTrades Union.” It was soon worked up by the newspapers to a pitch at\r\nwhich it alarmed the employers, dismally excited the imaginations of\r\nthe middle class, and compelled the attention of the Government. But\r\nthere was no cause for apprehension. Lack of funds made the Association\r\nlittle more than a name. Practically no trade action is reported in\r\nsuch numbers of its organ as are still extant. The business of the\r\nManchester Committee seems to have been confined to the promotion of\r\nthe “Short Time Bill.” On April 23, 1831, at the general meeting of\r\nthe Association, then designated the Lancashire Trades Unions, it was\r\nresolved to prepare petitions in favour of extending this measure to\r\nall trades and all classes of workers. Active support was given in\r\nthe meantime to Mr. Sadler’s Factory Bill. Towards the end of the\r\nyear we suddenly lose all trace of the National Association for the\r\nProtection of Labour, as far as Manchester is concerned. “After it had\r\nextended about a hundred miles round this town,” writes a working-class\r\nnewspaper of 1832, “a fatality came upon it that almost threatened\r\nits extinction.... But though it declined in Manchester it spread and\r\nflourished in other places; and we rejoice to say that the resolute\r\nexample set by Yorkshire and other places is likely once more to revive\r\nthe drooping energies of those trades who had the honour of originating\r\nand establishing the Association.”[224]\r\n\r\nWhat the fatality was that extinguished the Association in Manchester\r\nis not stated; but Doherty, to whose organising ability its initial\r\nsuccess had been due, evidently quarrelled with the executive\r\ncommittee, and the _Voice of the People_ ceased to appear. In its place\r\nwe find Doherty issuing, from January 1832, the _Poor Man’s Advocate_,\r\nand vainly striving, in face of the “spirit” of “jealousy and faction,”\r\nto build up the Yorkshire branches of the Association into a national\r\norganisation, with its headquarters in London. After the middle of 1832\r\nwe hear no more, either of the Association itself or of Doherty’s more\r\nambitious projects concerning it.[225]\r\n\r\nThe place of the National Association was soon filled by other\r\ncontemporary general trade societies, of which the first and most\r\nimportant was the Builders’ Union, or the General Trades Union, as it\r\nwas sometimes termed. It consisted of the separate organisations of the\r\nseven building trades, viz. joiners, masons, bricklayers, plasterers,\r\nplumbers, painters, and builders’ labourers, and is, so far as we know,\r\nthe solitary example, prior to the present century, in the history\r\nof those trades of a federal union embracing all classes of building\r\noperatives, and purporting to extend over the whole country.[226]\r\n\r\nThe Grand Rules of the Builders’ Union set forth an elaborate\r\nconstitution in which it was attempted to combine a local and trade\r\nautonomy of separate lodges with a centralised authority for defensive\r\nand aggressive purposes. The rules inform us that “the object of this\r\nsociety shall be to advance and equalise the price of labour in every\r\nbranch of the trade we admit into this society.” Each lodge shall be\r\n“governed by its own password and sign, masons to themselves, and\r\njoiners to themselves, and so on;” and it is ordered that “no lodge be\r\nopened by any other lodge that is not the same trade of that lodge\r\nthat, opens them, that masons open masons, and joiners open joiners,\r\nand so on;” moreover, “no other member [is] to visit a lodge that is\r\nnot the same trade unless he is particularly requested.” Each trade had\r\nits own bye-laws; but these were subject to the general rules adopted\r\nat an annual delegate meeting. This annual conference of the “Grand\r\nLodge Delegates,” better known as the “Builders’ Parliament,” consisted\r\nof one representative of each lodge, and was the supreme legislative\r\nauthority, altering rules, deciding on general questions of policy, and\r\nelecting the president and other officials. The local lodges, though\r\ndirectly represented at the annual meetings, had had apparently little\r\nconnection in the interim with the seat of government. The society\r\nwas divided into geographical districts, the lodges in each district\r\nsending delegates to quarterly district meetings, which elected a\r\ngrand master, deputy grand master, and corresponding secretary for\r\nthe district, and decided which should be the “divisional lodge,”\r\nor district executive centre. These divisional lodges or provincial\r\ncentres were, according to the rules, to serve in turn as the grand\r\nlodge or executive centre for the whole society. Whether the members\r\nof the general committee were chosen by the general lodge or by the\r\nwhole society is not clear; but they formed, with the president and\r\ngeneral corresponding secretary, the national executive. The expenses\r\nof this executive and of the annual delegate meeting were levied on\r\nthe whole society, each lodge sending monthly returns of its members\r\nand a summary of its finances to the general secretary. The main\r\nbusiness of the national executive was to determine the trade policy\r\nof the Associations, and to grant or withhold permission to strike.\r\nAs no mention is made of friendly benefits, we may conclude that the\r\nBuilders’ Union, like most of the national or general Unions of this\r\nmilitant time, confined itself exclusively to defending its members\r\nagainst their employers.\r\n\r\nThe operative builders did not rest content with an elaborate\r\nconstitution and code. There was also a ritual. The Stonemasons’\r\nSociety has preserved among its records a MS. copy of a “Making Parts\r\nBook,” ordered to be used by all lodges of the Builders’ Union on the\r\nadmission of members. Under the Combination Laws oaths of secrecy and\r\nobedience were customary in the more secret and turbulent Trade Unions,\r\nnotably that of the Glasgow Cotton-spinners and the Northumberland\r\nMiners. The custom survived the repeal; and admission to the Builders’\r\nUnion involved a lengthy ceremony conducted by the officers of the\r\nlodge--the “outside and inside tylers,” the “warden,” the “president,”\r\n“secretary,” and “principal conductor”--and taken part in by the\r\ncandidates and the members of the lodge. Besides the opening prayer,\r\nand religious hymns sung at intervals, these “initiation parts”\r\nconsisted of questions and responses by the _dramatis personæ_ in\r\nquaint doggerel, and were brought to a close by the new members taking\r\na solemn oath of loyalty and secrecy. Officers clothed in surplices,\r\ninner chambers into which the candidates were admitted blindfolded,\r\na skeleton, drawn sword, battle-axes, and other mystic “properties”\r\nenhanced the sensational solemnity of this fantastic performance.[227]\r\nCeremonies of this kind, including what were described to the Home\r\nOffice as “oaths of a most execrable nature,”[228] were adopted by\r\nall the national and general Unions of the time: thus we find items\r\nfor “washing surplices” appearing in the accounts of various lodges\r\nof contemporary societies. Although in the majority of cases the\r\nritual was no doubt as harmless as that of the Freemasons or the\r\nOddfellows, yet the excitement and sensation of the proceedings may\r\nhave predisposed lightheaded fanatical members, in times of industrial\r\nconflict, to violent acts in the interest of the Association. At all\r\nevents, the references to its mock terrors in the capitalist press seem\r\nto have effectually scared the governing classes.\r\n\r\nThe first years of the Builders’ Union, apparently, were devoted to\r\norganisation. During 1832 it rapidly spread through the Lancashire and\r\nMidland towns; and at the beginning of the following year a combined\r\nattack was made upon the Liverpool employers. The ostensible grievance\r\nof the men was the interference of the “contractor,” who, supplanting\r\nthe master mason, master carpenter, etc., undertook the management of\r\nall building operations. A placard issued by the Liverpool Painters\r\nannounces that they have joined “the General Union of the Artisans\r\nemployed in the process of building,” in order to put down “that\r\nbaneful, unjust, and ruinous system of monopolising the hard-earned\r\nprofits of another man’s business, called ‘contracting,’” Naturally,\r\nthe little masters were not friendly to the contracting system; and\r\nmost of them agreed with the men’s demand that its introduction should\r\nbe resisted. Encouraged by this support, the several branches of the\r\nbuilding trade in Liverpool simultaneously sent in identical claims\r\nfor a uniform rate of wages for each class of operatives, a limitation\r\nof apprentices, the prohibition of machinery and piecework, and other\r\nrequirements special to each branch of the trade. These demands were\r\ncommunicated to the employers in letters couched in dictatorial and\r\neven insulting terms, and were coupled with a claim to be paid wages\r\nfor any time they might lose by striking to enforce their orders. “We\r\nconsider,” said one of these letters, “that as you have not treated\r\nour rules with that deference you ought to have done, we consider\r\nyou highly culpable and deserving of being severely chastised.” And\r\n“further,” says another, “that each and every one in such strike shall\r\nbe paid by you the sum of four shillings per day for every day you\r\nrefuse to comply.”[229]\r\n\r\nThis sort of language brought the employers of all classes into line.\r\nAt a meeting held in June 1833 they decided not only to refuse all\r\nthe men’s demands, but to make a deliberate attempt to extinguish\r\nthe Union. For this purpose they publicly declared that henceforth\r\nno man need apply for work unless he was prepared to sign a formal\r\nrenunciation of the Trades Union and all its works. The insistence\r\non this formal renunciation, henceforth to be famous in Trade Union\r\nrecords as the “presentation of the document,” exasperated the\r\nBuilders’ Union. The Liverpool demands were repeated in Manchester,\r\nwhere the employers adopted the same tactics as at Liverpool.[230]\r\n\r\nIn the very heat of the battle (September 1833) the Builders’ Union\r\nheld its annual delegate meeting at Manchester. It lasted six days;\r\ncost, it is said, over £3000; and was attended by two hundred and\r\nseventy delegates, representing thirty thousand operatives. This\r\nsession of the “Builders’ Parliament” attracted universal attention.\r\nRobert Owen addressed the Conference at great length, confiding to it\r\nhis “great secret” “that labour is the source of all wealth,” and that\r\nwealth can be retained in the hands of the producers by a universal\r\ncompact among the productive classes. It was decided, perhaps under his\r\ninfluence, to build central offices at Birmingham, which should also\r\nserve as an educational establishment. The design for this “Builders’\r\nGild Hall,” as it was termed, was made by Hansom, an architect who,\r\nas an enthusiastic disciple of Owen, threw himself heartily into the\r\nstrike that was proceeding also in this town. It included, on paper,\r\na lecture-hall and various schoolrooms for the children of members.\r\nThe foundation-stone was laid with great ceremony on December 5, 1833,\r\nwhen the Birmingham trades marched in procession to the site, and\r\nenthusiastic speeches were made.[231]\r\n\r\nWe learn from the _Pioneer, or Trades Union Magazine_ (an unstamped\r\npenny weekly newspaper published at first at Birmingham, at that time\r\nthe organ of the Builders’ Union[232]), the ardent faith and the vast\r\npretensions of these New Unionists. “A union founded on right and just\r\nprinciples,” wrote the editor in the first number, “is all that is now\r\nrequired to put poverty and the fear of it for ever out of society.”\r\n“The vaunted power of capital will now be put to the test: we shall\r\nsoon discover its worthlessness when deprived of your labour. Labour\r\nprolific of wealth will readily command the purchase of the soil; and\r\nat a very early period we shall find the idle possessor compelled to\r\nask of you to release him from his worthless holding.” Elaborate plans\r\nwere propounded for the undertaking of all the building of the country\r\nby a Grand National Gild of Builders: each lodge to elect a foreman;\r\nand the foremen to elect a general superintendent. The disappointment\r\nof these high hopes was rude and rapid. The Lancashire societies\r\ndemurred to the centralisation which had been voted by the delegate\r\nmeeting in September at the instigation of the Midland societies. Two\r\ngreat strikes at Liverpool and Manchester ended towards the close of\r\nthe year in total failure. The Builders’ Gild Hall was abandoned;[233]\r\nand the _Pioneer_ moved to London, where it became the organ of another\r\nbody, the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union, with which the\r\nsouth country and metropolitan branches of the building trade had\r\nalready preferred to affiliate themselves. Nevertheless the Builders’\r\nUnion retained its hold upon the northern counties during the early\r\nmonths of 1834, and held another “parliament” at Birmingham in April,\r\nat which Scotch and Irish representatives were present.[234]\r\n\r\nThe aggressive activity and rapid growth of the Builders’ Union\r\nduring 1832-33 had been only a part of a general upheaval in labour\r\norganisation. The Cotton-spinners had recovered from the failure of the\r\nAshton strike (1830-31) by the autumn of 1833, when we find Doherty\r\nprosecuting with his usual vigour the agitation for an eight hours day\r\nwhich had been set on foot by his Society for National Regeneration.\r\n“The plan is,” writes J. Fielden (M.P. for Oldham) to William Cobbett,\r\n“that about the 1st March next, the day the said Bill (now Act) limits\r\nthe time of work for children under eleven years of age to eight hours\r\na day, those above that age, both grown persons and adults, should\r\ninsist on eight hours a day being the maximum of time for them to\r\nlabour; and their present weekly wages for sixty-nine hours a week\r\nto be the minimum weekly wages for forty-eight hours a week after\r\nthat time”; and he proceeds to explain that the Cotton-spinners had\r\nadopted this idea of securing shorter hours by a strike rather than\r\nby legislation on Lord Althorpe’s suggestion that they should “make a\r\nshort-time bill for themselves.”[235] Fielden and Robert Owen served,\r\nwith Doherty, on the committee of this society, which included a few\r\nemployers. The Lancashire textile trades followed the lead of the\r\nCotton-spinners, and prepared for a “universal” strike. Meanwhile\r\ntheir Yorkshire brethren were already engaged in an embittered struggle\r\nwith their employers. The Leeds Clothiers’ Union, established about\r\n1831, and apparently one of the constituent societies of the National\r\nAssociation for the Protection of Labour, bore a striking resemblance\r\nto the Builders’ Union, not only in ceremonial and constitution, but\r\nalso in its policy and history.[236] In the spring of 1833 it made a\r\nseries of attacks on particular establishments with the double aim of\r\nforcing all the workers to join the Union and of obtaining a uniform\r\nscale of prices. These demands were met with the usual weapon. The\r\nemployers entered into what was called “the Manufacturers’ Bond,” by\r\nwhich they bound themselves under penalty to refuse employment to\r\nall members of the Union. The men indignantly refused to abandon the\r\nsociety; and a lock-out ensued which lasted some months, and was the\r\noccasion of repeated leading articles in the _Times_.[237]\r\n\r\nThe Potters’ Union (also established by Doherty in 1830) numbered,\r\nin the autumn of 1833, eight thousand members, of whom six thousand\r\nbelonged to Staffordshire and the remainder to the lodges at\r\nNewcastle-on-Tyne, Derby, Bristol, and Swinton[238]--another instance\r\nof the extraordinary growth of Trade Unions during these years.\r\n\r\nHow far these and other societies were joined together in any federal\r\nbody is not clear. The panic-stricken references in the capitalist\r\npress to “the Trades Union,” and the vague mention in working-class\r\nnewspapers of the affiliation of particular societies to larger\r\norganisations, lead us to believe that during the year 1833 there was\r\nmore than one attempt to form a “General Union of All Trades.” The\r\nOwenite newspapers, towards the end of 1833, are full of references\r\nto the formation of a “General Union of the Productive Classes.” What\r\nmanner of association Owen himself contemplated may be learnt from his\r\nspeech to the Congress of Owenite Societies in London on the 6th of\r\nOctober. “I will now give you,” said he, “a short outline of the great\r\nchanges which are in contemplation, and which shall come suddenly upon\r\nsociety like a thief in the night.... It is intended that national\r\narrangements shall be formed to include all the working classes in the\r\ngreat organisation, and that each department shall become acquainted\r\nwith what is going on in other departments; that all individual\r\ncompetition is to cease; that all manufactures are to be carried on\r\nby National Companies.... All trades shall first form Associations of\r\nlodges to consist of a convenient number for carrying on the business:\r\n... all individuals of the specific craft shall become members.”[239]\r\nImmediately after this we find in existence a “Grand National\r\nConsolidated Trades Union,” in the establishment and extraordinary\r\ngrowth of which the project of “the Trades Union” may be said to have\r\nculminated. This organisation seems to have actually started in January\r\n1834. Owen was its chief recruiter and propagandist. During the next\r\nfew months his activity was incessant; and lodges were affiliated all\r\nover the country. Innumerable local trade clubs were absorbed. Early\r\nin February 1834 a special delegate meeting was held at Owen’s London\r\nInstitute in Charlotte Street, Fitzroy Square, at which it was resolved\r\nthat the new body should take the form of a federation of separate\r\ntrade lodges, each lodge to be composed usually of members of one\r\ntrade, but with provision for “miscellaneous lodges” in places where\r\nthe numbers were small, and even for “female miscellaneous lodges.”\r\nEach lodge retained its own funds, levies being made throughout the\r\nwhole order for strike purposes. The Conference urged each lodge\r\nto provide sick, funeral, and superannuation benefits for its own\r\nmembers; and proposals were adopted to lease land on which to employ\r\n“turn-outs,” and to set up co-operative workshops. The initiation\r\nrites and solemn oath, common to all the Unions of the period, were\r\napparently adopted.\r\n\r\nNothing in the annals of Unionism in this country at all approached\r\nthe rapidity of the growth which ensued.[240] Within a few weeks\r\nthe Union appears to have been joined by at least half a million\r\nmembers, including tens of thousands of farm labourers and women.\r\nThis must have been in great measure due to the fact that, as no\r\ndiscoverable regular contribution was exacted for central expenses,\r\nthe affiliation or absorption of existing organisations was very\r\neasy. Still, the extension of new lodges in previously unorganised\r\ntrades and districts was enormous. Numerous missionary delegates,\r\nduly equipped with all the paraphernalia required for the mystic\r\ninitiation rites, perambulated the country; and a positive mania for\r\nTrade Unionism set in. In December 1833 we are told that “scarcely a\r\nbranch of trade exists in the West of Scotland that is not now in a\r\nstate of Union.”[241] The _Times_ reports that two delegates who went\r\nto Hull enrolled in one evening a thousand men of various trades.[242]\r\nAt Exeter the two delegates were seized by the police, and found to\r\nbe furnished with “two wooden axes, two large cutlasses, two masks,\r\nand two white garments or robes, a large figure of Death with the dart\r\nand hourglass, a Bible and Testament.”[243] Shop-assistants on the one\r\nhand, and journeymen chimney-sweeps on the other, were swept into the\r\nvortex. The cabinetmakers of Belfast insisted on joining “the Trades\r\nUnion, or Friendly Society, which had for its object the unity of all\r\ncabinetmakers in the three kingdoms.”[244] We hear of “Ploughmen’s\r\nUnions” as far off as Perthshire,[245] and of a “Shearman’s Union”\r\nat Dundee. And the then rural character of the Metropolitan suburbs\r\nis quaintly brought home to us by the announcement of a union of the\r\n“agricultural and other labourers” of Kensington, Walham Green, Fulham,\r\nand Hammersmith. Nor were the women neglected. The “Grand Lodge of\r\nOperative Bonnet Makers” vies in activity with the miscellaneous “Grand\r\nLodge of the Women of Great Britain and Ireland”; and the “Lodge of\r\nFemale Tailors” asks indignantly whether the “Tailors’ Order” is really\r\ngoing to prohibit women from making waistcoats. Whether the Grand\r\nNational Consolidated Trades Union was responsible for the lodges of\r\n“Female Gardeners” and “Ancient Virgins,” who afterwards distinguished\r\nthemselves in the riotous demand for an eight hours day at Oldham,[246]\r\nis not clear.\r\n\r\nHow the business of this colossal federation was actually managed\r\nwe do not know.[247] Some kind of executive committee sat in London,\r\nwith four paid officers. The need for statesmanlike administration was\r\ncertainly great. The avowed policy of the federation was to inaugurate\r\na general expropriatory strike of all wage-earners throughout the\r\ncountry, not “to condition with the master-producers of wealth and\r\nknowledge for some paltry advance in the artificial money price in\r\nexchange for their labour, health, liberty, natural enjoyment, and\r\nlife; but to ensure to every one the best cultivation of all their\r\nfaculties and the most advantageous exercise of all their powers.”\r\nBut from the very beginning of its career it found itself incessantly\r\ninvolved in sectional disputes for small advances of wages and\r\nreduction of hours. The mere joining of “the Trades Union” was often\r\nmade the occasion of the dismissal by the employers of all those who\r\nwould not sign the “document” abjuring all combinations. Thus the\r\naccession of the Leicester Hosiers in November 1833 led to a disastrous\r\ndispute, in which over 1300 men had to be supported. In Glasgow a\r\nserious strike broke out among the building trades at a time when the\r\nCalico-printers, Engineers, and Cabinetmakers were already struggling\r\nwith their employers. The most costly conflict, however, which the\r\nGrand National found on its hands during the winter was that which\r\nraged at Derby, where fifteen hundred men, women, and children had been\r\nlocked out by their employers for refusing to abandon the Union. The\r\n“Derby turn-outs” were at first supported, like their fellow-victims\r\nelsewhere, by contributions sent from the trade organisations in\r\nvarious parts of the kingdom; but it soon became evident that without\r\nsystematic aid they would be compelled to give way. A levy of a\r\nshilling per member was accordingly decreed by the Grand National\r\nExecutive in February 1834. Arrangements were made for obtaining\r\npremises and machinery upon which to set a few of the strikers to work\r\non their own account. The struggle ended, after four months, in the\r\ncomplete triumph of the employers, and the return of the operatives to\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe “Derby turn-out” was widely advertised by the newspapers, and\r\nbrought much odium on the Grand National. But the denunciation of\r\n“the Trades Union” greatly increased when part of London was laid\r\nin darkness by a strike of the gas-stokers. The men employed by\r\nthe different gas companies in the metropolis had been quietly\r\norganising during the winter, with the intention of simultaneously\r\nwithdrawing from work if their demands were not acceded to. The\r\nplot was discovered, and the companies succeeded in replacing their\r\nUnion workmen by others. But weeks elapsed before the new hands were\r\nable completely to perform their work,[248] and early in March 1834\r\nWestminster was for some days in partial darkness. Amid the storm of\r\nobloquy caused by these disputes the Grand National suddenly found\r\nitself in conflict with the law. The conviction of six Dorchester\r\nlabourers in March 1834 for the mere act of administering an oath, and\r\ntheir sentence to seven years’ transportation, came like a thunderbolt\r\non the Trade Union world.\r\n\r\nTo understand such a barbarous sentence we must picture to ourselves\r\nthe effect on the minds of the Government and the propertied classes\r\nof the menacing ideal of “the Trades Union,” brought home by the\r\naggressive policy of the Unions during the last four years. Already\r\nin 1830 the formation of national and General Unions had excited\r\nthe attention of the Government. “When we first came into office in\r\nNovember last,” writes Lord Melbourne, the Whig Home Secretary, to Sir\r\nHerbert Taylor, “the Unions of trades in the North of England and in\r\nother parts of the country for the purpose of raising wages, etc., and\r\nthe General Union for the same purpose, were pointed out to me by Sir\r\nRobert Peel [the outgoing Tory Home Secretary] in a conversation I had\r\nwith him upon the then state of the country, as the most formidable\r\ndifficulty and danger with which we had to contend; and it struck me as\r\nwell as the rest of His Majesty’s servants in the same light.”[249]\r\n\r\nTo advise the Cabinet in this difficulty Lord Melbourne called in\r\nNassau Senior, who had just completed his first term of five years\r\nas Professor of Political Economy at Oxford, and directed him to\r\nprepare, in conjunction with a legal expert named Tomlinson, a report\r\non the situation and a plan of remedial legislation. This document\r\nthrows light both on the state of mind and on the practical judgement\r\nof the trusted economist. The two commissioners appear to have made\r\nno inquiries among workmen, and to have accepted implicitly every\r\nstatement, including hearsay gossip, offered by employers. The evidence\r\nthus collected naturally led to a very unfavourable conclusion. It\r\nproduced, as the commissioners recite, “upon our minds the conviction\r\nthat if the innocent and laborious workman and his family are to be\r\nleft without protection against the cowardly ferocity by which he\r\nis now assailed; if the manufacturer is to employ his capital and\r\nthe mechanist or chemist his ingenuity, only under the dictation of\r\nhis short-sighted and rapacious workmen, or his equally ignorant\r\nand avaricious rivals; if a few agitators are to be allowed to\r\ncommand a strike which first paralyses the industry of the peculiar\r\nclass of workpeople over whom they tyrannise, and then extends\r\nitself in an increasing circle over the many thousands and tens of\r\nthousands to whose labour the assistance of that peculiar class of\r\nworkpeople is essential;--that if all this is to be unpunished, and\r\nto be almost sanctioned by the repeal of the laws by which it was\r\nformerly punishable;--it is in vain to hope that we shall long retain\r\nthe industry, the skill, or the capital on which our manufacturing\r\nsuperiority, and with that superiority our power and almost our\r\nexistence as a nation, depends.” They accordingly conclude with a\r\nseries of astounding proposals for the amendment of the law. The Act\r\nof 1825 could not conveniently be openly repealed; but its mischievous\r\nresults were to be counteracted by drastic legislation. They\r\nrecommend that a law should be passed clearly reciting the common law\r\nprohibitions of conspiracy and restraint of trade. The law should go\r\non to forbid, under severe penalties, “all attempts or solicitations,\r\ncombinations, subscriptions, and solicitations to combinations”\r\nto threaten masters, to persuade blacklegs, or even simply to ask\r\nworkmen to join the Union.[250] Picketing, however peaceful, was to be\r\ncomprehensively forbidden and ruthlessly punished. Employers or their\r\nassistants were to be authorised themselves to arrest men without\r\nsummons or warrant, and hale them before any justice of the peace. The\r\nencouragement of combinations by masters was to be punished by heavy\r\npecuniary penalties, to be recovered by any common informer. “This,”\r\nsay the commissioners, “is as much as we should recommend in the first\r\ninstance. But if it should be proved that the evil of the combination\r\nsystem cannot be subdued at a less price, ... _we must recommend the\r\nexperiment of confiscation_,”--confiscation, that is, of the “funds\r\nsubscribed for purposes of combination and deposited in Savings Banks\r\nor otherwise.”[251]\r\n\r\nThe Whig Government dared not submit either the report or the\r\nproposals to a House of Commons pledged to the doctrines of Philosophic\r\nRadicalism. “We considered much ourselves,” writes Lord Melbourne,[252]\r\n“and we consulted much with others as to whether the arrangements of\r\nthese unions, their meetings, their communications, or their pecuniary\r\nfunds could be reached or in any way prevented by any new legal\r\nprovisions; but it appeared upon the whole impossible to do anything\r\neffectual unless we proposed such measures as would have been a serious\r\ninfringement upon the constitutional liberties of the country, and to\r\nwhich it would have been impossible to have obtained the consent of\r\nParliament.”\r\n\r\nThe King, however, had been greatly alarmed at the meeting of the\r\n“Builders’ Parliament,” and pressed the Cabinet to take strong\r\nmeasures.[253] Rotch, the member for Knaresborough, gave notice in\r\nApril 1834 of his intention to bring in a Bill designed to make\r\ncombinations of trades impossible--a measure which would have obtained\r\na large amount of support from the manufacturers.[254] The coal-owners\r\nand ship-owners, the ironmasters, had all been pressing the Home\r\nSecretary for legislation of this kind.\r\n\r\nBut although Lord Melbourne’s prudent caution saved the Unions from\r\ndrastic prohibitory laws, the Government lost no opportunity of showing\r\nits hostility to the workmen’s combinations. When in August 1833 the\r\nYorkshire manufacturers presented a memorial on the subject of “the\r\nTrades Union,” Lord Melbourne directed the answer to be returned that\r\n“he considers it unnecessary to repeat the strong opinion entertained\r\nby His Majesty’s Ministers of the criminal character and the evil\r\neffects of the unions described in the Memorial,” adding that “no\r\ndoubt can be entertained that combinations for the purposes enumerated\r\nare illegal conspiracies, and liable to be prosecuted as such at\r\ncommon law.”[255] The employers scarcely needed this hint. Although\r\ncombination for the sole purpose of fixing hours or wages had ceased\r\nto be illegal, it was possible to prosecute the workmen upon various\r\nother pretexts. Sometimes, as in the case of some Lancashire miners in\r\n1832, the Trade Unionists were indicted for illegal combination for\r\nmerely writing to their employers that a strike would take place.[256]\r\nSometimes the “molestation or obstruction” prohibited in the Act of\r\n1825 was made to include the mere intimation of the men’s intention\r\nto strike against the employment of non-unionists. In a remarkable\r\ncase at Wolverhampton in August 1835, four potters were imprisoned\r\nfor intimidation, solely upon evidence by the employers that they\r\nhad “advanced their prices in consequence of the interference of the\r\ndefendants, who acted as plenipotentiaries for the men,” without, as\r\nwas admitted, the use of even the mildest threat.[257] Picketing, even\r\nof the most peaceful kind, was frequently severely punished under this\r\nhead, as four Southwark shoemakers found in 1832 to their cost.[258]\r\nMore generally the men on strike were proceeded against under the laws\r\nrelating to masters and servants, as in the case of seventeen tanners\r\nat Bermondsey in February 1834, who were sentenced to imprisonment for\r\nthe offence of leaving their work unfinished.[259]\r\n\r\nWith the authorities in this temper, their alarm at the growth of the\r\nGrand National Consolidated Trades Union may be imagined. A new legal\r\nweapon was soon discovered. At the time of the mutiny at the Nore in\r\n1797 an Act had been passed (37 Geo. III. c. 123) severely penalising\r\nthe administering of an oath by an unlawful society. In 1819, when\r\npolitical sedition was rife, a measure prohibiting unlawful oaths had\r\nformed one of the notorious “Six Acts.” In neither case were trade\r\ncombinations aimed at, though Lord Ellenborough, in an isolated\r\nprosecution in 1802,[260] had held that an oath administered by a\r\ncommittee of journeymen shearmen in Wiltshire came within the terms\r\nof the earlier statute. It does not seem to have occurred to any one\r\nto put the law in force against Trade Unions until the oath-bound\r\nconfederacy of the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union began to\r\nmake headway even in the rural villages of the South of England.\r\n\r\nThe story of the trial and transportation of the Dorchester labourers\r\nis the best-known episode of early Trade Union history.[261] The\r\nagricultural labourers of the southern counties, oppressed by the\r\ntacit combinations of the farmers and by the operation of the Corn\r\nLaws, as well as exceptionally demoralised by the Old Poor Law, had\r\nlong been in a state of sullen despair. The specially hard times of\r\n1829 had resulted in outbursts of machine-breaking, rick-burning, and\r\nhunger riots, which had been put down in 1830 by the movement of troops\r\nthrough the disturbed districts, and the appointment of a Special\r\nCommission of Assize to try over 1000 prisoners, several of whom were\r\nhung and hundreds transported. The whole wage-earning population of\r\nthese rural districts was effectually cowed.[262] With the improvement\r\nof trade a general movement for higher wages seems to have been set\r\non foot. In 1832 we find the Duke of Wellington, as Lord-Lieutenant\r\nof Hampshire, reporting to Lord Melbourne that more than half the\r\nlabourers in his county were contributing a penny per week to a network\r\nof local societies affiliated, as he thought, to some National Union.\r\n“The labourers said that they had received directions from the Union\r\nnot to take less than ten shillings, and that the Union would stand by\r\nthem.”[263] These societies, whatever may have been their constitution,\r\nhad apparently the effect of raising wages not only in Hampshire, but\r\nalso in the neighbouring counties. In the village of Tolpuddle, in\r\nDorsetshire, as George Loveless tells us, an agreement was made between\r\nthe farmers and the men, in the presence of the village parson, that\r\nthe wages should be those paid in other districts. This involved a rise\r\nto ten shillings a week. In the following year the farmers repented of\r\ntheir decision, and successively reduced wages shilling by shilling\r\nuntil they were paying only seven shillings a week. In this strait\r\nthe men made inquiries about “the Trades Union,” and two delegates\r\nfrom the Grand National visited the village. Upon their information\r\nthe Lovelesses established “the Friendly Society of Agricultural\r\nLabourers,” having its “Grand Lodge” at Tolpuddle. For this village\r\nclub the elaborate ritual and code of rules of one of the national\r\norders of the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union were adopted. No\r\nsecrecy seems to have been observed, for John Loveless openly ordered\r\nof the village painter a figure of “Death painted six feet high for a\r\nsociety of his own,”[264] with which to perform the initiation rites.\r\nThe farmers took alarm, and induced the local magistrates, on February\r\n21, 1834, to issue placards warning the labourers that any one joining\r\nthe Union would be sentenced to seven years’ transportation. This was\r\nno idle threat. Within three days of the publication of the notice the\r\nLovelesses and four other members were arrested and lodged in gaol.\r\n\r\nThe trial of these unfortunate labourers was a scandalous perversion\r\nof the law. The Lovelesses and their friends seem to have been\r\nsimple-minded Methodists, two of them being itinerant preachers.\r\nNo accusation was made, and no evidence preferred against them, of\r\nanything worse than the playing with oaths, which, as we have seen,\r\nformed a part of the initiation ceremony of the Grand National and\r\nother Unions of the time, with evidently no consciousness of their\r\nstatutory illegality. Not only were they guiltless of any intimidation\r\nor outrage, but they had not even struck or presented any application\r\nfor higher wages. Yet the judge (John Williams), who had only recently\r\nbeen raised to the bench, charged the grand jury on the case at\r\nportentous length, as if the prisoners had committed murder or treason,\r\nand inflicted on them, after the briefest of trials, the monstrous\r\nsentence of seven years’ transportation.\r\n\r\nThe action of the Government shows how eagerly the Home Secretary\r\naccepted the blunder of an inexperienced judge as part of his policy of\r\nrepression. Lord Melbourne expressed his opinion that “the law has in\r\nthis case been most properly applied”;[265] and the sentence, far from\r\nexciting criticism in the Whig Cabinet, was carried out with special\r\ncelerity. The case was tried on March 18, 1834; before the 30th the\r\nprisoners were in the hulks; and by the 15th of the next month Lord\r\nHowick was able to say in the House of Commons that their ship had\r\nalready sailed for Botany Bay.[266]\r\n\r\nThe Grand National Consolidated Trades Union proved to have a wider\r\ninfluence than the Government expected. The whole machinery of the\r\norganisation was turned to the preparation of petitions and the\r\nholding of public meetings, and a wave of sympathy rallied, for a\r\nfew weeks, the drooping energies of the members. Cordial relations\r\nwere established with the five great Unions which remained outside\r\nthe ranks, for the northern counties were mainly organised by the\r\nBuilders’ Union, the Leeds, Huddersfield and Bradford District Union,\r\nthe Clothiers’ Union, the Cotton-spinners’ Union, and the Potters’\r\nUnion, which on this occasion sent delegates to London to assist the\r\nexecutive of the Grand National. The agitation culminated in a monster\r\nprocession of Trade Unionists to the Home Office to present a petition\r\nto Lord Melbourne--the first of the great “demonstrations” which have\r\nsince become a regular part of the machinery of London politics. The\r\nproposal to hold this procession had excited the utmost alarm, both\r\nin friends and to foes. The _Times_, with the Parisian events of 1830\r\nstill in its memory, wrote leader after leader condemning the project,\r\nand Lord Melbourne let it be known that he would refuse to receive\r\nany deputation or petition from a procession. Special constables were\r\nsworn in, and troops brought into London to prevent a rising. At\r\nlength the great day arrived (April 21, 1834). Owen and his friends\r\nmanaged the occasion with much skill. In order to avoid interference\r\nby the new police, the vacant ground at Copenhagen Fields, on which\r\nthe processionists assembled, was formally hired from the owner. The\r\ntrades were regularly marshalled behind thirty-three banners, each man\r\ndecorated by a red ribbon. At the head of the procession rode, in full\r\ncanonicals and the scarlet hood of a Doctor of Divinity, the corpulent\r\n“chaplain to the Metropolitan Trades Unions,” Dr. Arthur S. Wade.[267]\r\nThe demonstration, in point of numbers, was undoubtedly a success. We\r\nlearn, for instance, that the tailors alone paraded from 5000 to 7000\r\nstrong, and the master builders subsequently complained that their\r\nworks had been entirely suspended through their men’s participation.\r\nOver a quarter of a million signatures had been obtained to the\r\npetition, and, even on the admission of the _Times_, 30,000 persons\r\ntook part in the procession, representing a proportion of the London of\r\nthat time equivalent to 100,000 to-day.[268]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Radicals of all shades hastened to the rescue. A public\r\nmeeting was held at the Crown and Anchor Tavern at which Roebuck,\r\nColonel Perronet Thompson, and, Daniel O’Connell spoke; and a debate\r\ntook place in the House of Commons in which the ferocious sentence\r\nwas strongly attacked by Joseph Hume.[269] But the Government, far\r\nfrom remitting the punishment, refused even to recognise that it was\r\nexcessive; and the unfortunate labourers were allowed to proceed to\r\ntheir penal exile.[270]\r\n\r\nThe Dorchester conviction had the effect of causing the oath to\r\nbe ostensibly dropped out of Trade Union ceremonies, although in\r\nparticular trades and districts it lingered a few years longer.[271]\r\nAt their “parliament” in April 1834 the Builders’ Union formally\r\nabolished the oath. The Grand National quickly adopted the same\r\ncourse; and the Leeds and other Unions followed suit. But the judge’s\r\nsentence was of no avail to check the aggressive policy of the Unions.\r\nImmediately after the excitement of the procession had subsided, one\r\nof the most important branches of the Grand National precipitated a\r\nserious conflict with its employers. The London tailors, hitherto\r\ndivided among themselves, formed in December 1833 the “First Grand\r\nLodge of Operative Tailors,” and resolved to demand a shortening of the\r\nhours of labour. The state of mind of the men is significantly shown\r\nby the language of their peremptory notice to the masters. “In order,”\r\nthey write, “to stay the ruinous effects which a destructive commercial\r\ncompetition has so long been inflicting on the trade, they have\r\nresolved to introduce certain new regulations of labour into the trade,\r\nwhich regulations they intend shall come into force on Monday next.” A\r\ngeneral strike ensued, in which 20,000 persons are said to have been\r\nthrown out of work, the whole burden of their maintenance being cast on\r\nthe Grand National funds. A levy of eighteenpence per member throughout\r\nthe country was made in May 1834, which caused some dissatisfaction;\r\nand the proceeds were insufficient to prevent the tailors’ strike\r\npay falling to four shillings a week. The result was that the men\r\ngradually returned to work on the employers’ terms.[272]\r\n\r\nThese disasters, together with innumerable smaller strikes in various\r\nparts, all of which were unsuccessful, shook the credit of the Grand\r\nNational. The executive attempted in vain to stem the torrent of\r\nstrikes by publishing a “Declaration of the Views and Objects of Trades\r\nUnions,” in which they deprecated disputes and advocated what would now\r\nbe called Co-operative Production by Associations of Producers.[273]\r\nThey gave effect to this declaration by refusing to sanction the London\r\nshoemakers’ demand for increased wages, on the ground that a conflict\r\nso soon after the tailors’ defeat was inopportune. The result was\r\nmerely that a general meeting of the London shoemakers voted, by 782\r\nto 506, for secession from the federation, and struck on their own\r\naccount.[274]\r\n\r\nAn even more serious blow was the lock-out of the London building\r\ntrades in July 1834. These trades in London had joined the Grand\r\nConsolidated rather than the Builders’ Union; and in the summer of\r\n1834 an act of petty tyranny on the part of a single firm brought\r\nabout a general conflict. The workmen employed by Messrs. Cubitt\r\nhad resolved not to drink any beer supplied by Combe, Delafield &\r\nCo., in retaliation for the refusal of that firm to employ Trade\r\nUnionists. Messrs. Cubitt thereupon refused to allow any other beer\r\nto be drunk on their premises, and locked out their workmen. The\r\nemployers throughout London, angered by the Union’s resistance to\r\nsub-contract and piecework, embraced this opportunity to insist that\r\nall their employees should sign the hated “document.” The heads of the\r\nGovernment departments in which building operatives were employed\r\nplaced themselves in line with private employers by making the same\r\ndemands.[275] The struggle dragged on until November 1834, when the\r\ndocument seems to have been tacitly withdrawn, and the men returned to\r\nwork, accepting the employers’ terms on the other points at issue.[276]\r\nWe learn from the correspondence of the Stonemasons’ Society that this\r\ndefeat--for such it virtually was--completely broke up the organisation\r\nin the London building trade. What was happening to the Builders’ Union\r\nduring these months is not clear. The federal organisation apparently\r\nbroke up at about this time; and the several trades fell back upon\r\ntheir local clubs and national societies.\r\n\r\nWhilst the London builders were thus engaged, similar struggles were\r\ngoing on in the other leading industries. At Leeds, for instance, in\r\nMay 1834 the masters were again presenting the “document”; and the men,\r\nafter much resistance and angry denunciation, were compelled to abandon\r\nthe Clothiers’ Union. The Cotton-spinners, whom we left preparing to\r\ncarry out Fielden’s idea of a general strike for an eight hours day\r\nwith undiminished wages for all cotton operatives, resolved to demand\r\nthe reduction of hours from the 1st of March 1834, the day appointed\r\nfor the operation of the new Factory Act of 1833 limiting the hours\r\nof children to eight per day. The operatives in many mills sent in\r\nnotices, which were simply ignored by the employers. In this they seem\r\nto have estimated the weakness of the men correctly; for the expected\r\ngeneral strike was deferred by a delegate meeting until the 2nd of\r\nJune. That date found the men still unprepared for action, and the\r\nstrike was further postponed until the 1st of September. After that we\r\nhear no more of it.\r\n\r\nThe Oldham operatives did indeed in April 1834 make an unpremeditated\r\nattempt to secure eight hours. It happened that the local constables\r\nbroke up a Trade Union meeting. A rescue took place, followed by an\r\nattack on an obnoxious mill, and the shooting of one of the rioters\r\nby a “Knobstick.” The affray provoked the Oldham working class into\r\na spasm of insurrection. The workers in all trades, both male and\r\nfemale, ceased work, and held huge meetings on the Moor, where they\r\nwere addressed by Doherty and others from Manchester, and demanded the\r\neight hours day. Within a week the excitement subsided, and work was\r\nresumed.[277]\r\n\r\nBy the end of the summer it was obvious that the ambitious projects\r\nof the Grand National Consolidated and other “Trades Unions” had\r\nended in invariable and complete failure. In spite of the rising\r\nprosperity of trade, the strikes for better conditions of labour had\r\nbeen uniformly unsuccessful. In July 1834 the federal organisations\r\nall over the country were breaking up. The great association of half a\r\nmillion members had been completely routed by the employers’ vigorous\r\npresentation of the “document.” Of the actual dissolution of the\r\norganisation we have no contemporary record, but the impression which\r\nit made on the more sober Trade Unionists may be gathered from the\r\nfollowing description, which appeared in a working-class journal seven\r\nyears afterwards. “We were present,” says the editor of the _Trades\r\nJournal_, “at many of the meetings of the Grand National Consolidated\r\nTrades Union, and have a distinct recollection of the excitement that\r\nprevailed in them--of the apparent determination to carry out its\r\nprinciples in opposition to every obstacle--of the enthusiasm exhibited\r\nby some of the speakers--of the noisy approbation of the meeting--the\r\nloud cries of ‘hear hear,’ ‘bravo,’ ‘hurra,’ ‘union for ever,’ etc. It\r\nwas the opinion of many at that time that little real benefit would be\r\neffected by this union, as their proceedings were indicative, not of a\r\ncalm and dispassionate investigation of the causes of existing evils,\r\nbut of an over-excited state of mind which would speedily evaporate,\r\nand leave them in the same condition as before. The event proved that\r\nthis opinion was not ill-founded. A little mole-hill obstructed their\r\nonward progress; and rather than commence the labour of removing so\r\npuny an obstacle, they chose to turn back, each taking his own path,\r\nregardless of the safety or the interests of his neighbour. It was\r\npainful to see the deep mortification of the generals and leaders of\r\nthis quickly inflated army, when left deserted and alone upon the\r\nfield.”[278]\r\n\r\nA period of general apathy in the Trade Union world ensued. The\r\n“London Dorchester Committee” continued with indomitable perseverance\r\nto collect subscriptions and present petitions for the return of the\r\nsix exiled labourers; but “the Trades Union,” together with the ideal\r\nfrom which it sprang, vanished in discredit. The hundreds of thousands\r\nof recruits from the new industries or unskilled occupations rapidly\r\nreverted to a state of disorganisation. The national “orders” of\r\nTailors and Shoemakers, the extended organisations of Cotton-spinners\r\nand Woollen-workers, split up into fragmentary societies. Throughout\r\nthe country the organised constituents of the Grand National fell back\r\nupon their local trade clubs.\r\n\r\nThe records of the rise and fall of the “New Unionism” of 1830-4\r\nleave us conscious of a vast enlargement in the ideas of the workers,\r\nwithout any corresponding alteration in their tactics in the field. In\r\ncouncil they are idealists, dreaming of a new heaven and a new earth;\r\nhumanitarians, educationalists, socialists, moralists: in battle they\r\nare still the struggling, half-emancipated serfs of 1825, armed only\r\nwith the rude weapons of the strike and boycott; sometimes feared and\r\nhated by the propertied classes; sometimes merely despised; always\r\noppressed, and miserably poor. We find, too, that they are actually\r\nless successful with the old weapons now that they wield them with new\r\nand wider ideas. They get beaten in a rising market instead of, as\r\nhitherto, only in a falling one. And we shall soon see that they did\r\nnot recover their lost advantage until they again concentrated their\r\nefforts on narrower and more manageable aims. But we have first to\r\ninquire how they came by the new ideas.\r\n\r\nIn the bad times which followed the peace of 1815 the writings of\r\nCobbett had attained an extraordinary influence and authority over the\r\nwhole of that generation of working men. His trenchant denunciation of\r\nthe governing classes, and his incessant appeals to the wage-earners\r\nto assert their right to the whole administration of affairs, were\r\ninspired by the political tyranny of the anti-Jacobin reaction, the\r\nhigh prices and heavy taxes, and the apparent creation by “the Funding\r\nSystem” of an upstart class of non-producers living on the interest\r\nof the huge debt contracted by the nation during the war--evils the\r\nleast of which was enough to stimulate an eager politician like Cobbett\r\nto the utmost exercise of his unrivalled power of invective. But the\r\nworking classes were suffering, in addition, from a calamity which\r\nno mere politician of that time grasped, in the effects of the new\r\nmachine and factory industry, which was blindly crushing out the old\r\nmethods by the mere brute force of competition instead of replacing\r\nit with due order and adjustment to the human interests involved.\r\nThis phenomenon was beyond the comprehension of its victims. Each of\r\nthem knew what was happening to himself as an individual; but only\r\none man--a manufacturer--seems to have understood what was happening\r\nto the entire industry of the country. This man was Robert Owen. To\r\nhim, therefore, political Democracy, which was all-in-all to Cobbett\r\nand his readers, appeared quite secondary to industrial Democracy,\r\nor the co-operative ownership and control of industry answerable to\r\nthe economic co-operation in all industrial processes which had\r\nbeen brought about by machinery and factory organisation, and which\r\nhad removed manufacture irrevocably from the separate firesides of\r\nindependent individual producers. With Cobbett and his followers the\r\nfirst thing to be done was to pass a great Reform Bill, behind which,\r\nin their minds, lay only a vague conception of social change. Owen and\r\nhis more enthusiastic disciples, on the other hand, were persuaded that\r\na universal voluntary association of workers for productive purposes on\r\nhis principles would render the political organisation of society of\r\ncomparatively trivial account.\r\n\r\nThe disillusionment of the newly emancipated Trade Clubs in the\r\ncollapse of 1825 left the working-class organisations prepared for\r\nthese wider gospels. Social reform was in the air. “Concerning the\r\nmisery and degradation of the bulk of the people of England,” writes\r\na contemporary observer, “men of every order, as well as every party,\r\nunite and speak continually; farmers, parish officers, clergymen,\r\nmagistrates, judges on the bench, members on either side of both Houses\r\nof Parliament, the King in his addresses to the nation, moralists,\r\nstatesmen, philosophers; and finally the poor creatures themselves,\r\nwhose complaints are loud and incessant.”[279] Cobbett and the\r\nReformers had the first turn. The chief political organisation of the\r\nworking classes during the Reform Bill agitation began as a trade\r\nclub. In 1831 a few carpenters met at their house of call in Argyle\r\nStreet, Oxford Street, to form a “Metropolitan Trades Union,” which\r\nwas to include all trades, and to undertake, besides its Trade Union\r\nfunctions, a vague scheme of co-operative production and a political\r\nagitation for the franchise.[280] But under the influence of William\r\nLovett the last object soon thrust aside all the rest. The purely\r\nTrade Union aims were dropped; the Owenite aspirations sank into the\r\nbackground; and under the title of the “National Union of the Working\r\nClasses” the humble carpenters’ society expanded into a national\r\norganisation for obtaining Manhood Suffrage. As such it occupies,\r\nduring the political turmoil of 1831-2, by far the largest place in the\r\nhistory of working-class organisation, and was largely implicated in\r\nthe agitation and disturbances connected with the Reform Bill.[281]\r\n\r\nThe Reform Bill came and passed, but no Manhood Suffrage. The effect\r\nof this disappointment at the hands of the most advanced political\r\nparty in the country is thus described by Francis Place, now become an\r\noutside observer of the Trade Union Movement. “The year (1833) ended\r\nleaving the (National) Union (of the Working Classes) in a state of\r\nmuch depression. The nonsensical doctrines preached by Robert Owen\r\nand others respecting communities and goods in common; abundance of\r\neverything man ought to desire, and all for four hours’ labour out of\r\nevery twenty-four; the right of every man to his share of the earth in\r\ncommon, and his right to whatever his hands had been employed upon; the\r\npower of masters under the present system to give just what wages they\r\npleased; the right of the labourer to such wages as would maintain him\r\nand his in comfort for eight or ten hours’ labour; the right of every\r\nman who was unemployed to employment and to such an amount of wages as\r\nhave been indicated--and other matters of a similar kind which were\r\ncontinually inculcated by the working men’s political unions, by many\r\nsmall knots of persons, printed in small pamphlets and handbills which\r\nwere sold twelve for a penny and distributed to a great extent--had\r\npushed politics aside ... among the working people. These pamphlets\r\nwere written almost wholly by men of talent and of some standing in\r\nthe world, professional men, gentlemen, manufacturers, tradesmen, and\r\nmen called literary. The consequence was that a very large proportion\r\nof the working people in England and Scotland became persuaded that\r\nthey had only to combine, as it was concluded they might easily do,\r\nto compel not only a considerable advance in wages all round, but\r\nemployment for every one, man and woman, who needed it, at short hours.\r\nThis notion induced them to form themselves into Trades Unions in a\r\nmanner and to an extent never before known.”[282]\r\n\r\nThis jumble of ordinary Trade Union aims and communist aspirations,\r\ndescribed from the hostile point of view of a fanatical Malthusian and\r\nstaunch believer in the “Wage Fund,” probably fairly represents the\r\ncharacter of the Owenite propaganda. It made an ineradicable impression\r\non the working-class leaders of that generation, and inspired the great\r\nsurge of solidarity which rendered possible the gigantic enlistments of\r\nthe Grand National, with its unprecedented regiments of agricultural\r\nlabourers and women. Its enlargement of consciousness of the working\r\nclass was no doubt a good in itself which no mistakes in practical\r\npolicy could wholly cancel.[283] But Owen did mischief as well as\r\ngood; and as both the evil and the good live after him--for nothing\r\nthat Owen did can yet be said to be interred with his bones--it is\r\nnecessary to examine his Trade Union doctrine in some detail. He was\r\nat his best when, as the experienced captain of industry, he denounced\r\nwith fervent emphasis that lowering of the Standard of Life which was\r\nthe result of the creed of universal competition. It was to combat\r\nthis that he advocated Factory Legislation, and promoted combinations\r\n“to fix a maximum time and a minimum wages”; and it was by thus\r\nattempting to secure the workers’ Standard of Life by legislation and\r\nTrade Union action that he gained the influential support, not only\r\nof philanthropists, but also of certain high-minded manufacturers,\r\nwith whose aid he formed in December 1833 the “Society for National\r\nRegeneration,”[284] to which we have already referred. The most\r\ndefinite proposal of this society, the shortening of the hours of\r\nlabour to eight per day, was what led to that suggestion of Fielden’s\r\non which the Lancashire cotton operatives acted in their abortive\r\ngeneral strike for an eight hours day. It also produced the long series\r\nof “Short Time Committees” in the textile towns whose persistent\r\nagitation eventually secured the passing of the Ten Hours Bill, itself\r\nonly an instalment of our great Factory Code. History has emphatically\r\njustified Owen on this side of his labour policy.\r\n\r\nBut there was a Utopian side to it which acted more questionably.\r\nThe working-class world became, under his influence, inflated with a\r\npremature conception and committed to an impracticable working scheme\r\nof social organisation. He proved himself an able thinker and seer\r\nwhen he pointed out that the horrible poverty of the time was a new\r\neconomic phenomenon, the inevitable result of unfettered competition\r\nand irresponsible individual ownership of the means of production\r\nnow that those means had become enormously expensive and yet compact\r\nenough to employ hundreds of men under the orders of a few, besides\r\nbeing so prodigiously efficient as to drive the older methods quite\r\nout of the market. But from the point of view of the practical\r\nstatesman, it must be confessed that he also showed himself something\r\nof a simpleton in supposing, or at least assuming, that competition\r\ncould be abolished and ownership socialised by organising voluntary\r\nassociations to supersede both the millowners and the State. He had\r\ntried the experiment in America with the famous community of New\r\nHarmony, and its failure had for the time thoroughly disgusted him\r\nwith communities. But his disgust was not disillusion, for its only\r\npractical effect was to set him to repeat the experiment with the Trade\r\nUnions. Under his teaching the Trade Unionists came to believe that it\r\nwas possible, by a universal non-political compact of the wage-earners,\r\napparently through a universal expropriatory strike, to raise wages and\r\nshorten the hours of labour “to an extent,” as Place puts it, “which,\r\nat no very distant time, would give them the whole proceeds of their\r\nlabour.” The function of the brain-worker as the director of industry\r\nwas disregarded, possibly because in the cotton industry (in which Owen\r\nhad made a fortune) it plays but an insignificant part in the actual\r\nproductive processes, and is mainly concerned with that pursuit of\r\ncheap markets to buy in and dear markets to sell in which formed no\r\npart of the Utopian commonwealth at which “the Trades Union” aimed. The\r\nexisting capitalists and managers were therefore considered as usurpers\r\nto be as soon as possible superseded by the elected representatives\r\nof voluntary and sectional associations of producers, in which it\r\nseems to have been assumed all the brain-working technicians would be\r\nincluded. The modern Socialist proposal to substitute the officials\r\nof the Municipality or State was unthinkable at a period when all\r\nlocal governing bodies were notoriously inefficient and corrupt and\r\nParliament practically an oligarchy. Under the system proposed by Owen\r\nthe instruments of production were to become the property, not of the\r\nwhole community, but of the particular set of workers who used them.\r\n“There is no other alternative,” he said, “than National Companies for\r\neach trade.... Thus all those trades which relate to clothing shall\r\nform a company--such as tailors, shoemakers, hatters, milliners, and\r\nmantua-makers; and all the different manufacturers [_i.e._ operatives]\r\nshall be arranged in a similar way; communications shall pass from the\r\nvarious departments to the Grand National establishment in London.” In\r\nfact, the Trade Unions were to be transformed into “national companies”\r\nto carry on all the manufactures.[285] The Agricultural Union was\r\nto take possession of the land, the Miners’ Union of the mines, the\r\nTextile Unions of the factories. Each trade was to be carried on by its\r\nparticular Trade Union, centralised in one “Grand Lodge.”\r\n\r\nOf all Owen’s attempts to reduce his Socialism to practice this was\r\ncertainly the very worst. For his short-lived communities there was at\r\nleast this excuse: that within their own area they were to be perfectly\r\nhomogeneous little Communist States. There were to be no conflicting\r\nsections; and profit-making and competition were to be effectually\r\neliminated. But in “the Trades Union,” as he conceived it, the mere\r\ncombination of all the workmen in a trade as co-operative producers no\r\nmore abolished commercial competition than a combination of all the\r\nemployers in it as a Joint Stock Company. In effect his Grand Lodges\r\nwould have been simply the head offices of huge Joint Stock Companies\r\nowning the entire means of production in their industry, and subject\r\nto no control by the community as a whole. They would therefore have\r\nbeen in a position at any moment to close their ranks and admit fresh\r\ngenerations of workers only as employees at competitive wages instead\r\nof as shareholders, thus creating at one stroke a new capitalist class\r\nand a new proletariat. Further, the improvident shareholders would soon\r\nhave begun to sell their shares in order to spend their capital, and\r\nthus to drop with their children into the new proletariat; whilst the\r\nenterprising and capable shareholders would equally have sold their\r\nshares to buy into other and momentarily more profitable trades. Thus\r\nthere would have been not only a capitalist class and proletariat, but\r\na speculative stock market. Finally there would have come a competitive\r\nstruggle between the Joint Stock Unions to supplant one another in\r\nthe various departments of industry. Thus the shipwrights, making\r\nwooden ships, would have found the boilermakers competing for their\r\nbusiness by making iron ships, and would have had either to succumb\r\nor to transform their wooden ship capital into iron ship capital and\r\nenter into competition with the boilermakers as commercial rivals in\r\nthe same trade. This difficulty was staring Owen in the face when he\r\nentered the Trade Union Movement; for the trades, then as now, were\r\nin continual perplexity as to the exact boundaries between them; for\r\nexample, the minute-books of the newly formed Joiners’ Society in\r\nGlasgow (whose secretary was a leading Owenite) show that its great\r\ndifficulty was the demarcation of its trade against the cabinetmaker\r\nand the engineer-patternmaker, each of whom claimed certain technical\r\noperations as proper to himself alone. In short, the Socialism of Owen\r\nled him to propose a practical scheme which was not even socialistic,\r\nand which, if it could possibly have been carried out, would have\r\nsimply arbitrarily redistributed the capital of the country without\r\naltering or superseding the capitalist system in the least.\r\n\r\nAll this will be so obvious to those who comprehend our capitalist\r\nsystem that they will have some difficulty in believing that it could\r\nhave escaped so clever a man and so experienced and successful a\r\ncapitalist as Owen. How far he made it a rule to deliberately shut\r\nhis eyes to the difficulties that met him, from a burning conviction\r\nthat any change was better than leaving matters entirely alone, cannot\r\neven be guessed; but it is quite certain that he acted in perfect\r\ngood faith, simply not knowing thoroughly what he was about. He had\r\na boundless belief in the power of education to form character; and\r\nif any scheme promised just sufficient respite from poverty and\r\ndegradation to enable him and his disciples to educate one generation\r\nof the country’s children, he was ready to leave all economic\r\nconsequences to be dealt with by “the New Moral World” which that\r\ngeneration’s Owenite schooling would have created. Doubtless he thought\r\nthat “the Trades Union” promised him this much; and besides, he did not\r\nforesee its economic consequences. He was disabled by that confident\r\nsciolism and prejudice which has led generations of Socialists to\r\nborrow from Adam Smith and the “classic” economists the erroneous\r\ntheory that labour is by itself the creator of value, without going\r\non to master that impregnable and more difficult law of economic rent\r\nwhich is the very corner-stone of collectivist economy. He took his\r\neconomics from his friend William Thompson,[286] who, like Hodgskin and\r\nHodgskin’s illustrious disciple, Karl Marx, ignored the law of rent in\r\nhis calculations, and taught that all exchange values could be measured\r\nin terms of “labour time” alone. Part of the Owenite activity of the\r\ntime actually resulted in the opening of labour bazaars, in which\r\nthe prices were fixed in minutes. The fact that it is the consumer’s\r\ndemand which gives to the product of labour any exchange-value at\r\nall, and that the extent and elasticity of this demand determines\r\nhow much has to be produced; and the other governing consideration,\r\nnamely, that the expenditure of labour required to bring articles of\r\nthe same desirability to market varies enormously according to natural\r\ndifferences in fertility of soil, distance to be traversed, proximity\r\nto good highways, waterways, or ports, accessibility of water-power or\r\nsteam fuel, and a hundred other circumstances, including the organising\r\nability and executive dexterity of the producer, found themselves left\r\nentirely out of account. Owen assumed that the labour of the miner\r\nand that of the agricultural labourer, whatever the amount and nature\r\nof the product of each of them, would spontaneously and continuously\r\nexchange with each other equitably at par of hours and minutes when the\r\nminers had received a monopoly of the bowels of the country, and the\r\nagricultural labourers of its skin. He did not even foresee that the\r\nMiners’ Union might be inclined to close its ranks against newcomers\r\nfrom the farm labourers, or that the Agricultural Union might refuse\r\nto cede sites for the Builders’ Union to work upon. In short, the\r\ndifficult economic problem of the equitable sharing of the advantages\r\nof superior sites and opportunities never so much as occurred to the\r\nenthusiastic Owenite economists of this period.\r\n\r\nOne question, and that the most immediately important of all, was\r\nnever seriously faced: How was the transfer of the industries from the\r\ncapitalists to the Unions to be effected in the teeth of a hostile and\r\nwell-armed Government? The answer must have been that the overwhelming\r\nnumbers of “the Trades Union” would render conflict impossible. His\r\nenthusiastic disciple, William Benbow, successively a shoemaker,\r\nbookseller, and coffee-house keeper, invented the instrument of the\r\nGeneral Strike--a sacred “holiday month” prepared for and participated\r\nin by the entire wage-earning class, the mere “passive resistance” of\r\nwhich would, without violence or conflict, bring down all existing\r\ninstitutions. Whether this was in Owen’s mind in 1834, as it was, in\r\n1839, avowedly in those of the Chartists, is uncertain.[287] At all\r\nevents, Owen, like the early Christians, habitually spoke as if the Day\r\nof Judgment of the existing order of society was at hand. The next six\r\nmonths, in his view, were always going to see the “New Moral World”\r\nreally established. The change from the capitalist system to a complete\r\norganisation of industry under voluntary associations of producers was\r\nto “come suddenly upon society like a thief in the night.” “One year,”\r\ncomments his disciple, “may disorganise the whole fabric of the old\r\nworld, and transfer, by a sudden spring, the whole political government\r\nof the country from the master to the servant.”[288] It is impossible\r\nnot to regret that the first introduction of the English Trade Unionist\r\nto Socialism should have been effected by a foredoomed scheme which\r\nviolated every economic principle of Collectivism, and left the\r\nindispensable political preliminaries to pure chance.\r\n\r\nIt was under the influence of these large plans and confident hopes\r\nthat the Trade Unions were emboldened to adopt the haughty attitude and\r\ncontemptuous language towards the masters which provoked Manchester and\r\nLiverpool employers to meet the challenge of the Builders’ Union by\r\n“the Document.” The “intolerable tyranny” of the Unions, so much harped\r\non by contemporary writers, represents, to a large extent, nothing more\r\nthan the rather bumptious expression of the Trade Unionists’ feeling\r\nthat they were the rightful directors of industry, entitled to choose\r\nthe processes, and select their fellow-workers, and even their managers\r\nand foremen. And it must be remembered that this occurred at a period\r\nwhen class prejudice was so strong that any attempt at a parley made\r\nby the workers, however respectfully, was regarded as presumptuous\r\nand unbecoming. Hence the working class had always too much reason to\r\nbelieve that civility on their part would be thrown away. It is certain\r\nthat during the Owenite intoxication the impracticable expectations\r\nof national dominion on the part of the wage-earners were met with an\r\nequally unreasonable determination by the governing classes to keep\r\nthe working men in a state not merely of subjection, but of abject\r\nsubmission. The continued exclusion of the workmen from the franchise\r\nmade constitutional action on their side impossible. The employers,\r\non the other hand, used their political and magisterial power against\r\nthe men without scruple, inciting a willing Government to attack the\r\nworkmen’s combinations by every possible perversion of the law, and\r\npartiality in its administration. Regarding absolute control over\r\nthe conduct of their workpeople as a _sine qua non_ of industrial\r\norganisation, even the genuine philanthropists among them insisted\r\non despotic authority in the factory or workshop. Against the abuse\r\nof this authority there was practically no guarantee. On the other\r\nside it can be shown that large sections of the wage-earners were not\r\nonly moderate in their demands, but submissive in their behaviour. As\r\na rule, wherever we find exceptional aggression and violence on the\r\npart of the operatives, we discover exceptional tyranny on the side\r\nof the employers. To give an example or two, the continual outrages\r\nwhich disgrace the annals of Glasgow Trade Unionism for the first\r\nforty years of this century are accounted for by the reports of the\r\nvarious Parliamentary Inquiries which mark out the Glasgow millowners\r\nas extraordinarily autocratic in their views and tyrannous in their\r\nconduct. Again, the aggressive conduct of certain sections of the\r\nbuilding trades is frequently complained of in the capitalist press\r\nbetween 1830-40. But the agreements which the large contractors of\r\nthat time required “all those to sign who enter into their employ,”\r\nprinted copies of which are still extant, show that the demands of\r\nthe employers were intolerably arbitrary.[289] Then there is the\r\ncase of the miners of Great Britain, who were in very ill repute for\r\nriotous proceedings from 1837-44. The provocation they received may\r\nbe judged from a manifesto issued by Lord Londonderry in his dual\r\ncapacity as mine-owner and Lord-Lieutenant of Durham County during\r\nthe great strike of the miners in 1844 for fairer terms of hiring.\r\nHe not only superintends, as Lord-Lieutenant, the wholesale eviction\r\nof the strikers from their homes, and their supersession by Irishmen\r\nspecially imported from his Irish estates, but he peremptorily orders\r\nthe resident traders in “his town of Seaham,” on pain of forfeiting his\r\ncustom and protection, to refuse to supply provisions to the workmen\r\nengaged in what he deems “an unjust and senseless warfare _against\r\ntheir proprietors and masters_.”[290] The same intolerance marks\r\nthe magazines and journals of the dominant classes of the period. It\r\nseems to have been habitually taken for granted that the workman had\r\nnot merely to fulfil his contract of service, but to yield implicit\r\nobedience in the details of his working life to the will of his\r\nmaster. Combinations and strikes on the part of the “lower orders”\r\nwere regarded as futile and disorderly attempts to escape from their\r\nnatural position of social subservience. In short, the majority of\r\nemployers, even in this time of negro emancipation, seem to have been\r\nunconsciously acting upon the dictum subsequently attributed to J. C.\r\nCalhoun, the defender of American slavery, that “the true solution of\r\nthe contest of all time between labour and capital is that capital\r\nshould own the labourer whether white or black.”\r\n\r\nThe closing scene of Owen’s first and last attempt at “the Trades\r\nUnion” shows how ephemeral had been his participation in the real life\r\nof the Trade Union Movement. In August 1834 he called together one of\r\nhis usual miscellaneous congresses, consisting of delegates from all\r\nkinds of Owenite societies, with a few from the Grand National and\r\nother Trade Unions. At this congress the “Grand National Consolidated\r\nTrades Union,” which was to have brought to its feet Government,\r\nlandlords, and employers, was formally converted into the “British and\r\nForeign Consolidated Association of Industry, Humanity, and Knowledge,”\r\nhaving for its aim the establishment of a “New Moral World” by the\r\nreconciliation of all classes. Beyond one or two small and futile\r\nexperiments in co-operative production, it had attempted nothing to\r\nrealise Owen’s Utopia. Its whole powers had been spent, seemingly\r\nwith his own consent, in a series of aggressive strikes. For all\r\nthat, Owen’s meteoric appearance in the Trade Union World left a deep\r\nimpression on the movement. The minute-books and other contemporary\r\nrecords of the Trade Unions of the next decade abound in Owenite\r\nphraseology, such as the classification of Society into the “idle” and\r\nthe “industrious” classes, the latter apparently meaning--and being\r\ncertainly understood to mean--only the manual workers. More important\r\nis the persistence of the idea that the Trade Unions, as Associations\r\nof Producers, should recover control of the instruments of production.\r\nFrom this time forth innumerable attempts were made, by one Trade Union\r\nor another, to employ its own members in Productive Co-operation. A\r\nlong series of industrial disasters, culminating in the great losses of\r\n1874, has, even now, scarcely eradicated the last remnant of this Joint\r\nStock Individualism from the idealists of the Trade Union Movement; or\r\ntaught them to distinguish accurately between it and the demonstrably\r\nsuccessful Co-operative Production of the Associations of Consumers\r\nwhich constitute the Co-operative Movement of to-day. Outside the\r\norganised ranks his effect upon general working-class opinion was,\r\nas Place remarks, enormous, as we could abundantly show were we here\r\nconcerned with the “Union Shops,” “Equitable Labour Exchanges,” and\r\nindustrial communities which may be considered the most direct result\r\nof the Owenite propaganda, or with the fortunes of the innumerable\r\nco-operative associations of producers, whose delegates formed the\r\nbackbone of the Owenite congresses of these years.[291]\r\n\r\nThe Trade Union Movement was not absolutely left for dead when\r\nOwen quitted the field. The skilled mechanics of the printing and\r\nengineering trades had, as we shall presently see, held aloof from\r\nthe general movement, and their trade clubs were unaffected either by\r\nthe Owenite boom or its subsequent collapse. In some other trades the\r\ninflation of 1830-4 spread itself over a few more years. The Potters’\r\nUnion went on increasing in strength, and in 1835 gained a notable\r\nvictory over the employers, when a “Green Book of Prices” was agreed\r\nto, which long remained famous in the trade. Renewed demands led to\r\nthe formation by the employers of a Chamber of Commerce to resist the\r\nmen’s aggression. The “yearly bond” was rigidly insisted upon, and a\r\ngreat strike ensued, which ended in 1837 in the complete collapse of\r\nthe Union.[292] In 1836 the Scottish compositors formed the General\r\nTypographical Association of Scotland, which for a few years exercised\r\nan effective control over the trade. The same year saw a notable\r\nstrike by the Preston Cotton-spinners, from which is dated the general\r\nadoption of the self-acting mule.[293] But the most permanent effect\r\nis seen in the building trades. The national Unions of Plumbers and\r\nCarpenters have preserved an unbroken existence down to the present\r\nday,[294] whilst the Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons\r\nremained for nearly another half century one of the most powerful of\r\nEnglish Unions. The fortnightly circulars of the English Stonemasons\r\nreveal, for a few years, not only a vigorous life and quick growth,\r\nbut also many successful short strikes to secure Working Rules and to\r\nmaintain Time Wages. The Scottish Stonemasons are referred to as being\r\neven more active and influential in trade regulation, and as having\r\nincluded practically all the Scottish masons. There is evidence, too,\r\nof informal federal action between the National Unions of Stonemasons,\r\nCarpenters, and Bricklayers. Unfortunately the absence of such modern\r\nmachinery of organisation as Trades Councils, Trade Union Congresses,\r\nand standing joint committees prevented the scattered sectional\r\norganisations from forming any general movement. This state of things\r\nwas broken into during the year 1837 by the sensational strikes in\r\nGlasgow, the prolonged legal prosecution and severe punishment of their\r\nleaders, and the appointment of a Parliamentary Committee of Inquiry\r\ninto the results of the repeal of the Combination Laws.\r\n\r\nWe do not propose to enter here into the details of the famous\r\ntrial of the five Glasgow cotton-spinners for conspiracy, violent\r\nintimidation, and for the murder of fellow-workers. But it is one of\r\nthe “leading cases” of Trade Union history, and the manifestations\r\nof feeling which it provoked show to the depths the state of mind of\r\nthe working classes.[295] The evidence given in court, and repeated\r\nbefore the Select Committee of 1838, leaves no reasonable doubt that\r\nthe Cotton-Spinners’ Union in its corporate capacity had initiated\r\na reign of terror extending over twenty years, and that some of the\r\nincriminated members had been personally guilty not of instigation\r\nalone, but of actual violence, if not of murder. In spite of this,\r\nthe whole body of working-class opinion was on their side, and the\r\nsentence of seven years’ transportation was received with as much\r\nindignation as that upon the Dorchester labourers four years before.\r\nThis was one of the natural effects of the class despotism and scarcely\r\nveiled rebellion which we have already described. The use of violence\r\nby working men, either against obnoxious employers or against traitors\r\nin their own ranks, was regarded in much the same way as the political\r\noffences of a subject race under foreign dominion. Such deeds did\r\nnot, in fact, necessarily indicate any moral turpitude on the part of\r\nthe perpetrators. No one accused the five Glasgow cotton-spinners of\r\nbad private character or conduct, and at least four out of the five\r\nwere men of acknowledged integrity and devotedness.[296] Their unjust\r\ntreatment whilst awaiting trial, and still more their sentence to\r\ntransportation, enlisted the sympathy of the Parliamentary Radicals,\r\nand Wakley, the member for Finsbury, did not hesitate to bring their\r\ncase before the House of Commons as one of legal persecution and\r\ninjustice.\r\n\r\nAt this time the trade societies of Dublin and Cork had caused serious\r\ncomplaint by attempting to establish, and not without violence, an\r\neffective monopoly in certain skilled industries. Their action had been\r\nreproved by Daniel O’Connell, whom they, in their turn, had repudiated\r\nand denounced. O’Connell defeated Wakley’s friendly motion for an\r\ninquiry into the cotton-spinners’ case by a serious indictment of Trade\r\nUnionism. By a clever analysis of the rules of the Irish societies,\r\nwhich he made out to be purely obstructive and selfish, he condemned,\r\nin a speech of great power, all attempts on the part of trade\r\ncombinations to regulate the conditions of labour. The well-established\r\nmethods of modern Trade Unionism, such as the maintenance of a minimum\r\nrate, received from him the same condemnation as the unsocial and\r\noppressive monopolies for which the Irish trades had long been\r\nnotorious. The Government met this speech by granting a Select\r\nCommittee under Sir Henry Parnell to inquire into the whole question;\r\nand Trade Unionism accordingly found itself once more on its defence\r\nas a permanent element in social organisation. The case of the Glasgow\r\ncotton-spinners and the appointment of this Parliamentary Committee\r\nfor the moment revived the sentiment of solidarity in the Trade Union\r\nworld. A joint committee of the Glasgow trades was formed to collect\r\nsubscriptions for the defence of the prisoners; and communications for\r\nthis purpose were made to all the known Trade Unions. Considerable\r\nfunds were subscribed, as the trial was repeatedly postponed at great\r\nexpense to the prisoners; and when at last, in January, 1838, they were\r\nconvicted and sentenced, a combined agitation for some mitigation of\r\ntheir punishment was begun. By this time it had become known that some\r\nkind of inquiry into Trade Unionism was in contemplation. The Unions\r\nat once set their house in order. The Stonemasons, who had already\r\ngiven up the administration of oaths, resolved, for greater security\r\nagainst illegal practices, “that all forms of regalia, initiation, and\r\npasswords be dispensed with and entirely abolished.”[297] The Dublin\r\nPlasterers formally suspended their exclusive rules, and deferred\r\nthe issue of a new edition until after the inquiry.[298] In Glasgow,\r\nthe chief seat of the disorder, many societies--among others, the\r\nlocal Carpenters--deliberately burned their minute-books and archives\r\nfor the past year. The London societies appointed a committee, “The\r\nLondon Trades Combination Committee,” to conduct the Unionist case\r\nin the Parliamentary inquiry. Lovett, then well known as a Radical\r\npolitician, became secretary, and issued a stirring address to the\r\nTrade Unions throughout the country, asking for subscriptions and\r\nevidence.[299] But the Parliamentary Committee proved both perfunctory\r\nand inconclusive. The Government, which had conceded it merely to rid\r\nitself of the importunity of Wakley on the one hand and O’Connell on\r\nthe other, had evidently no intention of taking any action on the\r\nsubject; and the Committee, always thinly attended, made no attempt\r\nat a general inquiry, and confined itself practically to Dublin and\r\nGlasgow. O’Connell got the opportunity he desired of demonstrating,\r\nthrough selected witnesses, the violent and exclusive spirit which\r\nanimated the Irish Unions. With regard to Glasgow, the chief witness\r\nwas Sheriff, afterwards Sir Archibald, Alison, whose vigorous action\r\nhad quelled the cotton-spinners in that city. It was scarcely necessary\r\nto call witnesses on behalf of the Unions; but John Doherty, then\r\nbecome a master-printer and bookseller, was allowed to describe the\r\nManchester spinners’ organisation and the ill-fated associations of\r\n1829-31. The inquiry resulted in nothing but the presentation to the\r\nHouse of two volumes of evidence, without even so much as a report. It\r\nseems to have been expected that the Committee would be reappointed\r\nto complete its task; but when the next session came the matter was\r\nquietly dropped.[300]\r\n\r\nThe temporary fillip given by the cotton-spinners’ trial and the\r\nParliamentary Committee did not stop the steady decline of Trade\r\nUnionism throughout the country. Trade, which had been on the wane\r\nsince 1836, grew suddenly worse. The decade closed with three of the\r\nleanest years ever known; and widespread distress prevailed. The\r\nmembership of the surviving Trade Unions rapidly decreased. The English\r\nStonemasons, perhaps the strongest of the contemporary societies,\r\nreduced themselves, in 1841, temporarily, to absolute bankruptcy by\r\ntheir disastrous strike against an obnoxious foreman on the rebuilding\r\nof the Houses of Parliament. The Scottish Stonemasons’ Society, of\r\nequal or greater strength, collapsed at about the same time, from\r\ncauses not known to us. The Glasgow trades had been completely\r\ndisorganised by the disasters of 1837. The Lancashire textile\r\noperatives showed no sign of life; whilst such growing societies as\r\nthe Ironfounders, the Journeymen Steam-Engine Makers and Millwrights,\r\nand the Boilermakers were crippled by the heavy drafts made upon their\r\nfunds by unemployed members. The state of mind of the working classes\r\nwas no more propitious than the state of trade. Fierce discontent\r\nand sullen anger are the characteristics of this period. Hatred of\r\nthe New Poor Law, of the iniquitous taxes on food, of the general\r\noppression by the dominant classes, blazes out in the Trade Union\r\nrecords of the time. The agitation for the “Six Points,” set on foot\r\nby Lovett and others in the Working Men’s Association of 1836, became\r\nthe centre of working-class aspiration. The _Northern Star_, started\r\nat the end of 1837, rapidly distanced all other provincial journals in\r\ncirculation. The lecturers of the Anti-Corn Law League increased the\r\npopular discontent, even when their own particular panacea failed to\r\nfind acceptance. A general despair of constitutional reform led to the\r\ngrowing supremacy of the “Physical Force” section of the Chartists, and\r\nto the insurrectionism of 1839-42.\r\n\r\nThe political developments of these years are outside the scope of\r\nthis work. The Chartist Movement plays the most important part in\r\nworking-class annals from 1837 to 1842, and does not quit the stage\r\nuntil 1848. Made respectable by sincerity, devotion, and even heroism\r\nin the rank and file, it was disgraced by the fustian of many of its\r\norators and the political and economic quackery of its pretentious and\r\nincompetent leaders whose jealousies and intrigues, by successively\r\nexcluding all the nobler elements, finally brought it to nought.\r\nAn adequate history of it would be of extreme value to our young\r\nDemocracy.[301] Here it is only necessary to say that whilst the\r\nChartist Movement commanded the support of the vast majority of the\r\nmanual-working wage-earners, outside the ranks of those who were\r\ndeeply religious, there is no reason to believe that the Trade Unions\r\nat any time became part and parcel of the Movement, as they had,\r\nduring 1833-4, of the Owenite agitation, though some of their members\r\nfurnished the most ardent supporters of the Charter. Individual trades,\r\nsuch as the shoemakers, seem to have been thoroughly permeated with\r\nChartism, and were always attempting to rally other trade societies to\r\nthe cause. The angry strikes of 1842 in Lancashire and the Midlands,\r\nfostered, as some said, by the Anti-Corn Law League, were “captured”\r\nby the Chartists, and almost converted into political rebellions. The\r\ndelegate meeting of the Lancashire and Yorkshire trade clubs, which\r\nwas conducting the “general strike” then in progress “for the wages\r\nof 1840,” resolved in August 1842 to recommend all wage-earners “to\r\ncease work until the Charter becomes the law of the land.”[302] For a\r\nfew weeks, indeed, it looked as if the Trade Union Movement, such as\r\nit was, would become merged in the political current. But the manifest\r\nabsurdity of persuading starving men to remain on strike until the\r\nwhole political machinery of the country had been altered, must have\r\nquickly become apparent to the shrewder Trade Unionists. When Chartist\r\nmeetings at Sheffield were calling for a “general strike” to obtain the\r\nCharter, the secretaries of seven local Unions wrote to the newspapers\r\nexplaining that their trades had nothing to do with the meetings\r\nor the resolutions.[303] It must be remembered in this connection\r\nthat the number of Trade Unionists was, in these years, relatively\r\nsmall--probably not so great as a hundred thousand in the whole\r\nkingdom--so that they could not have formed any appreciable proportion\r\nof the two, three or four million adherents that the Chartist leaders\r\nwere in the habit of claiming. And it may be doubted whether in\r\nany case a Trade Union itself, as distinguished from particular\r\nmembers who happened to be delegates, made any formal profession of\r\nadherence to Chartism. In the contemporary Trade Union records that\r\nare still extant, such as those of the Bookbinders, Compositors,\r\nIronfounders, Cotton-spinners, Steam-engine makers, and Stonemasons,\r\nthere are no traces of Chartist resolutions; although denunciations\r\nof the “Notorious New Poor Law oppression” abound in the _Fortnightly\r\nCircular_ of the Stonemasons;[304] whilst the Ironfounders,\r\nCompositors, and Cotton-spinners pass resolutions in favour of Free\r\nTrade. A partial explanation of this reticence on the more exciting\r\ntopic of the Charter is doubtless to be found in the frequently adopted\r\nrule excluding politics and religion from Trade Union discussions--a\r\nrule which was, in 1842, protested against by an enthusiastic Chartist\r\ndelegate from the Bookbinders at the Manchester Conference.[305] There\r\nmust, however, have been something more than mere obedience to the rule\r\nin the unwillingness of the trade societies to be mixed up with the\r\nChartist agitation. The rule had not prevented the organised trades of\r\n1831-2 from taking a prominent part in the Reform Bill Movement. The\r\nbanners of the Edinburgh trade clubs were conspicuous in the public\r\ndemonstration on the rejection of the Bill of 1831. When the House\r\nof Lords gave way, the Birmingham Trade Unions themselves organised\r\na triumphal procession, which was discountenanced by the middle\r\nclass.[306] The records of the London Brushmakers show that they\r\neven subscribed from the Union funds to Reform associations. But we\r\nnever find the trade societies of 1839-42 contributing to Chartist\r\nfunds, or even collecting money for Chartist victims. The cases of\r\nFrost, Williams, and Jones, the Newport rebels of 1839, were least\r\nas deserving of the working-class sympathy as those of the Glasgow\r\ncotton-spinners. But the Trade Unions showed no inclination to\r\nsubscribe money or get up petitions in aid of them. “Never,” writes\r\nFergus O’Connor, in 1846, “was there more criminal apathy than that\r\nmanifested by the trades of Great Britain to the sufferings of those\r\nmen;” and he adds, “that if one half that was done for the Dorchester\r\nlabourers or the Glasgow cotton-spinners had been done for Frost,\r\nWilliams, and Jones, they would long since have been restored.”[307]\r\n\r\nInsurrectionism, whether Owenite or Chartist, was, in fact, losing its\r\nattraction for the working-class mind. Robert Owen’s economic axioms of\r\nthe extinction of profit and the elimination of the profit-maker were,\r\nduring these very years, passing into the new Co-operative Movement,\r\ninaugurated in 1844 by the Rochdale Pioneers. The believers in a\r\n“new system of society,” to be brought about by universal agreement,\r\nwere henceforth to be found in the ranks of the commercial-minded\r\nCo-operators rather than in those of the militant Trade Unionists.\r\nChartism, meanwhile, had degenerated from Lovett’s high ideal of a\r\ncomplete political democracy to an ignoble scramble for the ownership\r\nof small plots of land. The example of the French Revolution of 1848\r\nfanned the dying embers for a few weeks into a new flame; and many of\r\nthe London trades swung into the somewhat theatrical fête of April 10,\r\n1848, swelling the procession against which the Duke of Wellington\r\nhad marshalled the London middle class. But the danger of revolution\r\nhad passed away. A new generation of workmen was growing up, to whom\r\nthe worst of the old oppression was unknown, and who had imbibed the\r\neconomic and political philosophy of the middle-class reformers.\r\nBentham, Ricardo, and Grote were read only by a few; but the activity\r\nof such popular educationalists as Lord Brougham and Charles Knight\r\npropagated “useful knowledge” to all the members of the Mechanics’\r\nInstitutes and the readers of the _Penny Magazine_. The middle-class\r\nideas of “free enterprise” and “unrestricted competition” which\r\nwere thus diffused received a great impetus from the extraordinary\r\npropaganda of the Anti-Corn Law League, and the general progress of\r\nFree Trade. Fergus O’Connor and Bronterre O’Brien struggled in vain\r\nagainst the growing dominance of Cobden and Bright as leaders of\r\nworking-class opinion. And so we find in the Trade Union records of\r\n1847-8, that vigorous resistance begins to be made to any movement in\r\nsupport of the old ideals. The Steam-Engine Makers’ Society suspended\r\nsome of their branches for depositing the branch funds in Fergus\r\nO’Connor’s Land Bank. When two branches of the Stonemasons’ Society\r\npropose the same investment, the others indignantly protest against\r\nit as an absurd political speculation. And it is significant that\r\nthese protests came, not from the cautious elders whose enthusiasm had\r\noutlived many failures, but from those who had never shared the old\r\nfaith. When in 1848 the Yorkshire Woolstaplers proposed to take a farm\r\nupon which to set to work their unemployed men, it was the younger\r\nmembers, as we are expressly told, who strenuously but vainly resisted\r\nthis action, which resulted ruinously for the society.\r\n\r\nAll this makes the close of the “revolutionary” period of the Trade\r\nUnion Movement. For the next quarter of a century we shall watch the\r\ndevelopment of the new ideas and the gradual building up of the great\r\n“amalgamated” societies of skilled artisans, with their centralised\r\nadministration, friendly society benefits, and the substitution,\r\nwherever possible, of Industrial Diplomacy for the ruder methods of the\r\nClass War.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[207] In a manuscript essay on the different forms of association,\r\nentitled “Trades Unions condemned, Trade Clubs justified,” Place gives\r\nus the distinction between the two. “A trade society,” he says, “that\r\nis, a club consisting of the journeymen in any one trade which does\r\nnot form part of a union of several trades, which does not appoint\r\ndelegates to meet other delegates, is a very different thing from a\r\nTrades Union, even though it may call itself a union. Trades Unions\r\nare those in which several trades, or portions of several trades, in\r\nthe same line of business or in different callings, are confederated\r\nby means of delegates.” Place often refers to this distinction between\r\nthe Trade Clubs, which were, according to his view, “very valuable\r\ninstitutions,” and the “Trades Unions,” or “associations of several or\r\nmany trades in one combination,” which he regarded as “very mischievous\r\nassociations.” William Lovett, too, watching the same transformation,\r\nmakes, in a letter published in the _Poor Man’s Guardian_ of August 30,\r\n1834, exactly the same distinction.\r\n\r\n[208] See the reports to the Home Secretary (Home Office Papers,\r\n42--179, 180, 181, 182); _The Town Labourer_ (by J.

Antrim, at the age of ten. In\r\n1816 he migrated to Manchester, where he quickly became one of the\r\nleading Trade Unionists, and secretary to the local Cotton-spinners’\r\nSociety. We find him, for instance, taking a prominent part in the\r\nagitation against the proposed re-enactment of the Combination Laws\r\nin 1825. Whether he was concerned in the Philanthropic Society or\r\nGeneral Union of 1818 or 1826 we do not know. In 1829 he organised the\r\ngreat strike of the Hyde spinners against a reduction of rates, and\r\nbecame, as described in the text, successively General Secretary to\r\nthe Federation of Spinners’ Societies, and to the National Association\r\nfor the Protection of Labour, in which office he is reported, probably\r\ninaccurately, to have received the then enormous salary of £600 a year.\r\nWe naturally find him the object of great suspicion by the Government,\r\nbut no charge seems ever to have been brought against him (Home Office\r\nPapers, 40--26, 27). The articles in the _Voice of the People_ and\r\nthe _Poor Man’s Advocate_, which are evidently from his pen, show him\r\nto have been a man of wide information, great natural shrewdness,\r\nand far-reaching aims. His idea was that all the local and district\r\nUnions were to be federated in a national organisation for the sole\r\npurpose of dealing with trade matters, and that they should also be\r\nfederated in a National Association for obtaining political reforms.\r\nIn 1832, during the Reform crisis, Place describes him as advising\r\nthe working classes to use the occasion for a social revolution. He\r\nsubsequently acted as secretary to an association of operatives and\r\nmasters established to enforce the Factory Acts, and was one of Lord\r\nShaftesbury’s most strenuous supporters. In 1838, when he had become\r\na printer and bookseller in Manchester, he gave evidence before the\r\nSelect Committee on Combinations of Workmen, in which he described the\r\nspinners’ organisations and strikes. There is a pamphlet by him in the\r\nGoldsmiths’ Library at the University of London, entitled _A Letter to\r\nthe Members of the National Association for the Protection of Labour_\r\n(Manchester, 1831).\r\n\r\n[214] Home Office Papers, 40--27.\r\n\r\n[215] _Ibid._, December 3, 1830, 40--26.\r\n\r\n[216] Foster died in 1831, and McGowan settled at Glasgow. “Almost\r\nevery spinning district,” writes the _Poor Man’s Advocate_ of June\r\n23, 1832, “of any consequence, was enrolled in the Union. The power\r\nof the Union, of course, increased with its members, and a number of\r\nthe worst-paying employers were compelled to advance the wages of the\r\nspinners to something like the standard rate.... The Union, however,\r\nwhich Mr. McGowan had mainly contributed to mature, has since, from\r\ndistrust or weariness, sunk into comparative insignificance.”\r\n\r\n[217] The letter is preserved in the MS. “Contribution Book” of the\r\nLiverpool Sailmakers’ Friendly Association, established 1817.\r\n\r\n[218] _Address of the National Association for the Protection of Labour\r\nto the Workmen of the United Kingdom_ (4 pp. 1830), in Home Office\r\nPapers, 40--27.\r\n\r\n[219] Given as Appendix to the pamphlet _On Combination of Trades_\r\n(1830).

Strikes and riotings in 1831\r\nand 1832 caused the troops to be called out: marines were sent from\r\nPortsmouth, and squadrons of cavalry scoured the country. After six\r\nmonths’ struggle in 1832 the Union collapsed, and the men submitted.\r\nSee Home Office Papers for these years, 40--31, 32, &c.; Sykes’ _Local\r\nRecords of Northumberland_, &c., vol. ii. pp. 293, 353; Fynes’ _Miners\r\nof Northumberland and Durham_ (Blyth, 1873), chaps, iv. v. vi.; _An\r\nEarnest Address and Urgent Appeal to the People of England in behalf of\r\nthe Oppressed and Suffering Pitmen of the Counties of Northumberland\r\nand Durham_ (by W. Scott, Newcastle, 1831); _History and Description of\r\nFossil Fuel_, etc. (by John Holland, 1835), pp. 298-304.\r\n\r\n[226] It is not clear whether this scheme was initiated by carpenters\r\nor masons. The carpenters and joiners are distinguished among the\r\nbuilding trades for the antiquity of their local trade clubs, which\r\nare known to have existed in London as far back as 1799. A national\r\norganisation was established in London in July 1827, called the\r\nFriendly Society of Operative Carpenters and Joiners, which still\r\nsurvives under the title of the “General Union.” MS. records in\r\nthe office of the latter show that this federation had 938 members\r\nin 1832, rising to 3691 in 1833, and to 6774 in 1834, a total not\r\nparalleled until 1865. This rapid increase marks the general upheaval\r\nof these years. But this Society did not throw in its lot with the\r\nBuilders’ Union until 1833. On the other hand, the existing Operative\r\nStonemasons’ Friendly Society, which dates its separate existence from\r\n1834, but which certainly existed in some form from 1832, has among\r\nits archives what appear to be the original MS. rules and initiation\r\nrites of its predecessor, the Builders’ Union; and in these documents\r\nthe masons figure as the foremost members. Moreover, these rules and\r\nrites closely resemble those of contemporary unions among the Yorkshire\r\nwoollen-workers; and an independent tradition fixes the parent lodge\r\nof the Masons’ Society at the great woollen centre of Huddersfield,\r\nwhereas the Friendly Society of Carpenters and Joiners, founded in\r\nLondon, had its headquarters at Leicester. But however this may be,\r\nthe constitution and ceremonies described in these documents owe their\r\nsignificance to the fact that they are nearly identical with those\r\nadopted by many of the national Unions of the period, and were largely\r\nadopted by the Grand National Consolidated Trades Union of 1834.\r\n\r\n[227] A similar ritual is printed in _Character, Objects, and\r\nEffects of Trades Unions_ (1834), as used by the Woolcombers’ Union.\r\nProbably the Builders’ Union copied their ritual from some union of\r\nwoollen-workers. The Stonemasons’ MS. contains, like the copy printed\r\nin this pamphlet, a solemn reference to “King Edward the Third,” who\r\nwas regarded as the great benefactor of the English wool trade, but\r\nwhose connection with the building trade is not obvious. In a later\r\nprinted edition of _The Initiating Parts of the Friendly Society of\r\nOperative Masons_, dated Birmingham, 1834, his name is omitted, and\r\nthat of Solomon substituted, apparently in memory of the Freemasons’\r\nassumed origin at the building of the Temple at Jerusalem.\r\n\r\nThe actual origin of this initiation ceremony is not certainly known\r\nJohn Tester, who had been a leader of the Bradford Woolcombers in 1825,\r\nafterwards turned against the Unions, and published, in the _Leeds\r\nMercury_ of June and July 1834, a series of letters denouncing the\r\nLeeds Clothiers’ Union. In these he states that “the mode of initiation\r\nwas the same as practised for years before by the flannel-weavers\r\nof Rochdale, with a party of whom the thing, in the shape it then\r\nwore, had at first originated.... A great part of the ceremony, ...\r\nparticularly the death scene, was taken from the ceremonial of one\r\ndivision of the Oddfellows, ... who were flannel-weavers at Rochdale,\r\nin Lancashire; and all that could be well turned from the rules and\r\nlectures of one society into the regulations of the others was so\r\nturned, with some trifling verbal alterations.” In another letter he\r\nsays that the writer of the “lecture book” was one Mark Warde. Tester\r\nis not implicitly to be believed, but it seems probable that the\r\nregalia, doggerel rhymes, and mystic rites of the unions of this time\r\nwere copied from those of an Oddfellows’ Lodge, with some recollections\r\nof Freemasonry. In his _Mutual Thrift_ (1891), the Rev. J. Frome\r\nWilkinson describes (p. 14) the initiation ceremony of the “Patriotic\r\nOddfellows,” a society which merged in the present “Grand United\r\nOrder of Oddfellows” before the close of the century. The ceremony so\r\ndescribed corresponds in many characteristic details with that of the\r\nTrades Unions. All the older friendly society “Orders” imposed an oath,\r\nand were consequently unlawful.\r\n\r\n[228] Home Office Papers, December 29, 1832, 40--31.\r\n\r\n[229] At Birmingham, when the builders’ strike presently extended to\r\nthat town, the following was the manifesto drawn up for adoption by the\r\nBuilders’ Union, for presentation to the leading building contractor\r\nwho had just undertaken to erect the new grammar-school. (No record of\r\nits adoption and presentation has been found.) “We, the delegates of\r\nthe several Lodges of the Building Trades, elected for the purpose of\r\ncorrecting the abuses which have crept into the modes of undertaking\r\nand transacting business, do hereby give you notice that you will\r\nreceive no assistance from the working-men in any of our bodies to\r\nenable you to fulfil an engagement which we understand you have entered\r\ninto with the Governors of the Free Grammar School to erect a new\r\nschool in New Street, unless you comply with the following conditions:\r\n\r\n“Aware that it is our labour alone that can carry into effect what\r\nyou have undertaken, we cannot but view ourselves as parties to your\r\nengagement, if that engagement is ever fulfilled; and as you had\r\nno authority from us to make such an engagement, nor had you any\r\nlegitimate right to barter our labour at prices fixed by yourself, we\r\ncall upon you to exhibit to our several bodies your detailed estimates\r\nof quantities and prices at which you have taken the work; and we call\r\nupon you to arrange with us a fixed percentage of profit for your own\r\nservices in conducting the building, and in finding the material on\r\nwhich our labour is to be applied.\r\n\r\n“Should we find upon examination that you have fixed equitable prices\r\nwhich will not only remunerate you for your superintendence but us for\r\nour toil, we have no objections upon a clear understanding to become\r\npartners to the contract, and will see you through it, after your\r\nhaving entered yourself a member of our body, and after your having\r\nbeen duly elected to occupy the office you have assumed” (_Robert Owen:\r\nA Biography_, by Frank Podmore, 1906, vol. ii. p. 442-4).\r\n\r\n[230] _An Impartial Statement of the Proceedings of the Members of the\r\nTrades Union Societies, and of the Steps taken in consequence by the\r\nMaster Traders of Liverpool_ (Liverpool, 1833); _Remarks on the Nature\r\nand Probable Termination of the Struggle now existing between the\r\nMaster and Journeyman Builders_ (Manchester, 1833); _Times_, June 27,\r\n1833.\r\n\r\n[231] _Pioneer_, December 7, 1833; _History of Birmingham_, by W.\r\nHutton (Birmingham, 1835), p. 87.\r\n\r\n[232] It was edited by James Morrison, an enthusiastic Owenite, who\r\ndied, worn out, in 1835 (_Beer’s History of British Socialism_, 1919,\r\np. 328).\r\n\r\n[233] It was eventually finished by the landlord, and still exists as a\r\nmetal warehouse in Shadwell Street.\r\n\r\n[234] In May 1834 an informer offered to supply the Home Secretary\r\nWith full particulars of its organisation, leading members and their\r\nactivities, for two sums of £50 each (Home Office Papers, 40--32).\r\n\r\n[235] Letters to Cobbett’s _Weekly Register_, reprinted in the\r\n_Pioneer_, December 21, 1833.

The employers seem to have regarded\r\nall the demands of the men as equally unreasonable, even the request\r\nfor a list of piecework prices. See _Times_, October 2, 1833. A printed\r\naddress _To the Flax and Hemp Trade of Great Britain_, issued by the\r\nflaxworkers of Leeds, November 30, 1832, refers with admiration to\r\nthe effectiveness of this Union (Home Office Papers, 40--31; see also\r\n41--11).\r\n\r\n[237] _Times_, October 28, 1833.\r\n\r\n[238] _Crisis_, October 19, 1833.\r\n\r\n[239] _Crisis_, October 12, 1833. The history of the General Trades\r\nUnions from 1832 to 1834 is mainly to be gathered from the files of\r\nthe Owenite press, the _Crisis_, the _Pioneer_, and the _Herald of the\r\nRights of Industry_, with frequent ambiguous references in the Home\r\nOffice Papers for these years. The _Poor Man’s Guardian_ and the _Man_\r\nalso contain occasional references. The _Official Gazette_, issued by\r\nthe Grand National Consolidated Trades Union itself in June 1834, has\r\nunfortunately not been preserved. We have also been unable to discover\r\nany copy of the Glasgow Owenite journals, the _Tradesman_, _Trades\r\nAdvocate_, _Liberator_, etc., mostly edited or written by Owen’s\r\ndisciple, Alexander Campbell, the secretary of the local joiners’ Trade\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\n[240] It is interesting to notice how closely this organisation\r\nresembles, in its Trade Union features, the well-known “Knights of\r\nLabour” of the United States, established in 1869, and for some years\r\none of the most powerful labour organisations in the world (“Historical\r\nSketch of the Knights of Labour,” by Carroll D. Wright, _Quarterly\r\nJournal of Economics_, January, 1887). Its place was taken by the\r\nAmerican Federation of Labour, with exclusively Trade Union objects.\r\n\r\n[241] _Glasgow Argus_, quoted in _People’s Conservative_, December 28,\r\n1833.\r\n\r\n[242] May 5, 1834.\r\n\r\n[243] _Times_, January 23 and 30, 1834.\r\n\r\n[244] _Kerr’s Exposition of Legislative Tyranny and Defence of the\r\nTrades Union_ (Belfast, 1834), vol. 1611 of the Halliday Tracts in the\r\nRoyal Irish Academy, Dublin; see _The Irish Labour Movement_, by W.

A “Memorial from the Grand National\r\nConsolidated Trades Union of Great Britain and Ireland to the Producers\r\nand Non-Producers of Wealth and Knowledge” is printed in the _Crisis_,\r\nMay 17, 1834; another, “to the Shopmen, Clerks, Porters and other\r\nindustrious non-producers,” in the issue for April 26, 1834.\r\n\r\n[248] See the London newspapers for March 1834; a good summary is given\r\nin the _Companion to the Newspaper_ for that month (p. 71).\r\n\r\n[249] September 26, 1831: _Lord Melbourne’s Papers_ (1889), ch. v. p.\r\n130. The note he left on leaving the Home Office was as follows: “I\r\ntake the liberty of recommending the whole of this correspondence _re_\r\nthe Union to the immediate and serious consideration of my successor\r\nat the Home Department” (Home Office Papers, 40--27). See also the\r\nstatements in the House of Lords debate, _Times_, April 29, 1834; and\r\nthe comments in _Labour Legislation, Labour Movements, and Labour\r\nLeaders_, by George Howell, 1902, p. 23.\r\n\r\n[250] “We recommend that the soliciting of any person to join in\r\ncombinations, or to subscribe to the like purposes, should be\r\npunishable on summary conviction by imprisonment for a shorter period,\r\nsay not exceeding two months.”\r\n\r\n[251] The report was never published, and lies in MS. in the Home\r\nOffice library. Ten years later, when Nassau Senior was acting as\r\nCommissioner to report on the condition of the handloom weavers,\r\nhe revived a good deal of his 1830 Report, but not the astonishing\r\nproposals quoted in the text. The portion thus revived appears in\r\nhis _Historical and Philosophical Essays_ (1865), vol. ii. We had\r\nplaced in our hands, through the kindness of Mrs. Simpson, daughter\r\nof Nassau Senior, the original answers and letters upon which his\r\nreport was based. This correspondence shows that the leading Manchester\r\nmanufacturers were not agreed upon the desirability of re-enacting the\r\nCombination Laws, though they, with one accord, advocated stringent\r\nrepression of picketing. Nor were they clear that combinations had, on\r\nthe whole, hindered the introduction of new machinery, one employer\r\neven maintaining that the Unions indirectly promoted its adoption.\r\nBut the most interesting feature of the correspondence is the extent\r\nto which the employers complained of the manner in which their rivals\r\nincited, and even subsidised, strikes against attempted reductions of\r\nrates. The millowner, whose improved processes gave him an advantage\r\nin the market, found any corresponding reduction of piecework rates\r\nresisted, not only by his own operatives, but by all the other\r\nmanufacturers in the district, who sometimes went so far as to publish\r\na joint declaration that any such reduction was ‘highly inexpedient.’\r\nThe evidence, in fact, from Nassau Senior’s point of view, justified\r\nhis somewhat remarkable proposal to punish employers for conniving at\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\n[252] Lord Melbourne to Sir Herbert Taylor, September 26, 1831\r\n(_Papers_, chap. v. p. 131). The workmen’s combinations began at\r\nthis time to attract more serious attention from capable students\r\nthan they had hitherto received. Two able pamphlets, published\r\nanonymously--there is reason to believe at the instance and at the\r\ncost of the Whig Government--_On Combinations of Trades_ (1830), and\r\n_Character, Objects, and Effects of Trades Unions_ (1834), set forth\r\nthe constitution and proceedings of the new unions, and criticise\r\ntheir pretensions in a manner which has not since been surpassed. The\r\nsecond of these was by Edward Carlton Tufnell, one of the factory\r\ncommissioners, and remains perhaps the best statement of the case\r\nagainst Trades Unionism. Tufnell also wrote a pamphlet, entitled\r\n_Trades Unionism and Strikes_ (1834; 12mo); and Harriet Martineau one\r\n_On the Tendency of Strikes and Sticks to produce Low Wages_ (Durham,\r\n1834; 12mo), neither of which we have seen. A well-informed but hostile\r\narticle, founded on these materials, appeared in the _Edinburgh Review_\r\nfor July 1834. Charles Knight published in the same year a sixpenny\r\npamphlet, _Trades Unions and Strikes_ (1834, 99 pp.), which took the\r\nform of a bitter denunciation of the whole movement.\r\n\r\n[253] See his letter of March 30, 1834, in _Lord Melbourne’s Papers_,\r\nchap. v.\r\n\r\n[254] _Leeds Mercury_, April 26, 1834.

An able article in the\r\n_Law Magazine_, vol xi. pp. 460-72, discusses the law of the case.\r\nThe defendants subsequently published two statements for popular\r\ncirculation, viz. _Victims of Whiggery, a statement of the persecution\r\nexperienced by the Dorchester Labourers_, by George Loveless (1837),\r\nand _A narrative of the sufferings of James Loveless, etc._ (1838),\r\nwhich are in the British Museum.

Through official blundering it\r\nwas two years later (April 1838) before five out of the six prisoners\r\nreturned home. The sixth, as we learn from a circular of the Committee,\r\ndated August 20, 1838, had even then not arrived. “Great and lasting\r\nhonour,” writes a well-informed contemporary, “is due to this body of\r\nworkmen (the London Dorchester Committee), about sixteen in number, by\r\nwhose indefatigable exertions, extending over a period of five years,\r\nand the valuable assistance of Thomas Wakley, M.P. for Finsbury, the\r\nsame Government who banished the men were compelled to pardon them\r\nand bring them home free of expense. From the subscriptions raised\r\nby the working classes during this period, amounting to about £1300,\r\nthe Committee, on the return of the men, were enabled to place five\r\nof them, with their families, in small farms in Essex, the sixth\r\npreferring (with his share of the fund) to return to his native place.”\r\n(Article in the _British Statesman_, April 9, 1842, preserved in Place\r\nMSS. 27820--320.)

We have first the old MS. doggerel already described, dating\r\nprobably from 1832. The first print of 1834, whilst retaining a good\r\ndeal of the ceremonial, turns the liturgy into prose and the oath into\r\nan almost identical “declaration,” invoking the “dire displeasure” of\r\nthe Society in case of treachery. The second print, which bears no\r\ndate, is much shorter; and the declaration becomes a mere affirmation\r\nof adhesion. The Society’s circulars of 1838 record the abolition,\r\nby vote of the members, of all initiation ceremonies, in view of the\r\nParliamentary Inquiry about to be held into Trade Unionism. But even\r\nthe simplified form of 1838 retains, in its reference to the workmen\r\nas “the real producers of _all_ wealth,” an unmistakable trace of the\r\nOwenite spirit of the Builders’ Union of 1832.\r\n\r\n[272] _Times_, April 30 to June 10; House of Lords debate, April 28;\r\n_Globe_, May 21, 1834; Home Office Papers, May 10, 1834, 40--32; _The\r\nTailoring Trade_, by F.

James Mill writes to Lord Brougham\r\non September 3, 1832, as follows: “Nothing can be conceived more\r\nmischievous than the doctrines which have been preached to the common\r\npeople.... The nonsense to which your lordship alludes about the right\r\nof the labourer to the whole produce of the country, wages, profits,\r\nand rent all included, is the mad nonsense of our friend Hodgskin,\r\nwhich he has published as a system, and propagates with the zeal of\r\nperfect fanaticism.... The illicit cheap publications, in which the\r\ndoctrine of the right of the labouring people, who they say are the\r\nonly producers, to all that is produced, is very generally preached,\r\n... are superseding the Sunday newspapers and every other channel\r\nthrough which the people might get better information” (Bain’s _James\r\nMill_, p. 363, 1882). The series of Socialist authors of these years,\r\nusually ignored, have been well described by Prof. Foxwell in his\r\nIntroduction to the English translation of Menger’s _Right to the Whole\r\nProduce of Labour_, 1899; and more fully and philosophically in M.\r\nBeer’s _History of British Socialism_, 1919, vol. i.\r\n\r\n[283] “Owen’s chief merit was that he filled the working classes with\r\nrenewed hope at a time when the pessimism, both of orthodox economists\r\nand of their unorthodox opponents, had condemned labour to be an\r\nappendage of machinery, a mere commodity whose value, like that of\r\nall commodities, was determined by the bare cost of keeping up the\r\nnecessary supply. Owen laid stress upon the human side of economics.\r\nThe object of industry was to produce happier and more contented men\r\nand women” (_The Chartist Movement_, by Mark Hovell, 1918, p. 45).\r\n\r\n[284] The prospectus of this Society is in the British Library of\r\nPolitical Science at the London School of Economics.

Mark Hovell (_The Chartist Movement_, 1918, p. 91) thinks\r\nhe was the same William Benbow whom Bamford mentions as a delegate\r\nfrom Manchester in 1817 (_Life of a Radical_, p. 8), and whom Henry\r\nHunt describes as of the Manchester Hampden Club, and as having been\r\nreported by a Government spy to be manufacturing pikes in 1816 (_The\r\nGreen Bag Plot_, 1918).\r\n\r\n[288] Leading article in the _Crisis_, October 12, 1833.\r\n\r\n[289] A specimen dated 1837 is preserved by the Stonemasons’ Society,\r\naccording to which a Liverpool contractor bound all his employees to\r\nserve him at a fixed wage for a long term of years, any time lost by\r\nsickness or otherwise not to be paid for and to be added to the term;\r\nall “lawful commands” to be obeyed; and no present or future club or\r\nother society to be joined without the employer’s consent.\r\n\r\n[290] See his manifestoes reprinted in _Northern Star_, July 6 and\r\nJuly 27, 1844. “Lord Londonderry again warns all the shopkeepers and\r\ntradesmen in his town of Seaham that if they still give credit to\r\npitmen who hold off work, and continue in the Union, such men will be\r\nmarked by his agents and overmen, and will never be employed in his\r\ncollieries again, and the shopkeepers may be assured that they will\r\nnever have any custom or dealings with them from Lord Londonderry’s\r\nlarge concerns that he can in any manner prevent.\r\n\r\n“Lord Londonderry further informs the traders and shopkeepers, that\r\nhaving by his measures increased very largely the last year’s trade\r\nto Seaham, and if credit is so improperly and so fatally given to his\r\nunreasonable pitmen, thereby prolonging the injurious strike, it is his\r\nfirm determination to carry back all the outlay of his concerns even to\r\nNewcastle.\r\n\r\n“Because it is neither fair, just, or equitable that the resident\r\ntraders in his own town should combine and assist the infatuated\r\nworkmen and pitmen in prolonging their own miseries by continuing\r\nan insane strike, and an unjust and senseless warfare against their\r\nproprietors and masters.”\r\n\r\n[291] Some account of these developments will be found in _The\r\nCo-operative Movement in Great Britain_, by Beatrice Potter (Mrs.\r\nSidney Webb).\r\n\r\n[292] The collapse was duly reported to the Home Secretary (Home Office\r\nPapers, 40--33, 34, 35).\r\n\r\n[293] See Ashworth’s paper before British Association, 1837; _Remarks\r\nupon the Importance of an Inquiry into the Amount and Appropriation\r\nof Wages by the Working Classes_, by W. Felkin, 1837; _Appeal to the\r\nPublic from the United Trades of Preston_, February 14, 1837 (in Home\r\nOffice Papers, 40--35).\r\n\r\n[294] The United Society of Operative Plumbers (reorganised 1848)\r\nstill dominates its branch of the trade, and retains traces of the\r\nfederal constitution of the Builders’ Union. The sister organisation\r\nof carpenters (now styled the General Union of Carpenters and Joiners)\r\nhas been overtaken and overshadowed by the newer Amalgamated Society of\r\nCarpenters and Joiners; whilst the Operative Bricklayers’ Society has\r\nabsorbed practically all the older societies in its own branch of the\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n[295] Glasgow was still the principal centre of the cotton industry,\r\nespecially in weaving. In 1838 there were in the Glasgow area about\r\n36,000 handlooms devoted mainly to cotton, with two persons to a\r\nloom, whilst in all Lancashire there were only 25,000 (Parliamentary\r\nPapers, xlii. of 1849 and xxiv. of 1840; _The Chartist Movement_, by\r\nMark Hovell, 1918, p. 14). Combination among the cotton operatives of\r\nGlasgow was of old standing. After the strike of 1812, already referred\r\nto, trouble broke out again in 1820 and 1822, when outrages were\r\ncommitted (_Arts and Artisans_, by J. G. Symons, 1839, p. 137).\r\n\r\nBesides securing full reports in the newspapers, the Trade Union\r\ncommittee conducting the case published at a low price an account of\r\nthe trial in parts, which has not been preserved. Two other exhaustive\r\nreports were issued, and may still be consulted, viz. _Report of\r\nthe trial of Thomas Hunter and other operative cotton-spinners in\r\nGlasgow in 1838_, by Archibald Swinton (Edinburgh, 1838), and _The\r\ntrial of Thomas Hunter, etc., the Glasgow Cotton-spinners_, by James\r\nMarshall (Glasgow, 1838).

This success we attribute mainly to the spread\r\nof education among the rank and file, and the more practical counsels\r\nwhich began, after 1842, to influence the Trade Union world. But we\r\nmust not overlook the effect of economic changes. The period between\r\n1825 and 1848 was remarkable for the frequency and acuteness of its\r\ncommercial depressions. From 1850 industrial expansion was for many\r\nyears both greater and steadier than in any previous period.[308] It is\r\nno mere coincidence that these years of prosperity saw the adoption\r\nby the Trade Union world of a “New Model” of organisation, under which\r\nTrade Unionism obtained a financial strength, a trained staff of\r\nsalaried officers, and a permanence of membership hitherto unknown.\r\n\r\nThe predominance of Chartism over Trade Unionism was confined to the\r\nbad times of 1837-42. Under the influence of the rapid improvement\r\nand comparative prosperity which followed, the Chartist agitation\r\ndwindled away; and a marked revival in Trade Unionism took effect in\r\nthe re-establishment, about 1843, of the Potters’ Union, and of an\r\nactive Cotton-spinners’ Association, and, in 1845, by the amalgamation\r\nof the metropolitan and provincial societies of compositors into\r\nthe National Typographical Society.[309] The powerful United Flint\r\nGlass Makers’ Society (reorganised in 1849 as the Flint Glass Makers’\r\nFriendly Society of Great Britain and Ireland) dates from the same\r\nyear. Delegate meetings of other trades were held; and national\r\nsocieties of tailors and shoemakers were set on foot. A national\r\nconference of curriers in 1845 established a federal union of all the\r\nlocal clubs in the trade. But the most important of the new bodies\r\nwas the Miners’ Association of Great Britain and Ireland, formed at\r\nWakefield in 1841.[310] Up to this period the miners, held in virtual\r\nserfage by the truck system and the custom of yearly hirings, had not\r\ngot beyond ephemeral strike organisations. Strong county Unions now\r\ngrew up in Northumberland and Durham on the one hand, and Lancashire\r\nand Yorkshire on the other; and the new body was a federation of these.\r\nUnder the leadership of Martin Jude, it developed an extraordinary\r\npropagandist activity, at one time paying no fewer than fifty-three\r\nmissionary organisers, who visited every coalpit in the kingdom. The\r\ndelegate meetings at Manchester and Glasgow in the year 1844 soon came\r\nto represent practically the whole of the mining districts of Great\r\nBritain; and the membership rose, it is said, to at least 100,000.[311]\r\n\r\nA leading feature of this Trade Unionist revival was a dogged\r\nresistance to legal oppression. Although the more sensational\r\nprosecutions of Trade Union leaders had ceased with the abandonment of\r\nunlawful oaths, there was still going on, up and down the kingdom, an\r\nalmost continuous persecution of the rank and file, by the magistrates’\r\ninterpretation of the law relating to masters and servants. The miners,\r\nin particular, were hampered by lengthy hirings, during which they were\r\ncompelled to serve if required, but were not guaranteed employment.\r\nUnskilled in legal subtleties, and not yet served by an experienced\r\nclass of Trade Union secretaries, they were made the victims of a\r\nthousand and one quibbles and technicalities. The Northumberland and\r\nDurham Miners’ Union grappled with the difficulty in a thoroughly\r\npractical spirit. They engaged W. P. Roberts,[312] an able and\r\nenergetic solicitor, with strong labour sympathies, to light every\r\ncase in the local courts. In 1844 the Miners’ Association of Great\r\nBritain and Ireland followed this excellent example by appointing\r\nRoberts their standing legal adviser at a salary of £1000 a year. When\r\nthe Durham miners had to relinquish his services at the end of 1844,\r\nhe was taken over by the newly formed Lancashire Miners’ Union. The\r\n“miners’ attorney-general,” as he was called, showed an indefatigable\r\nactivity in the defence of his clients, and was soon retained in\r\nall Trade Union cases. The magistrates throughout the country found\r\nthemselves for the first time confronted by a pertinacious legal\r\nexpert, who, far more ingenious than the employers, was not less\r\nunscrupulous in taking advantage of every technicality of the law.\r\n\r\nIn a letter written to the Flint Glass Makers’ Friendly Society in\r\n1851, Roberts himself gives a vivid picture of the difficulties\r\nagainst which the Unions had to contend. After explaining the law,\r\nas he understood it, he proceeds as follows: “But it is exceedingly\r\ndifficult to induce those of the class opposed to you to take this\r\nview of things. I do not say this sarcastically, but as a fact learnt\r\nby long and observant experience. There are indeed men on the bench\r\nwho are honest enough, and desirous of doing their duty. But all their\r\ntendencies and circumstances are against you. They listen to your\r\nopponents, not only often, but cheerfully--so they know more fully the\r\ncase against you than in your favour. To you they listen too--but in a\r\nsort of temper of ‘Prisoner at the Bar, you are entitled to make any\r\nstatement you think fit, and the Court is bound to hear you; but mind,\r\nwhatever you say,’ etc. In the one case you observe the hearty smile\r\nof goodwill; in the other the derisive sneer, though sometimes with a\r\nghastly sort of kindliness in it. Then there is the knowledge of your\r\noverwhelming power when acting unitedly, and this begets naturally\r\na corresponding desire to resist you at all hazards. And there are\r\nhundreds of other considerations all acting the same way--meetings,\r\npolitical councils, intermarriages, hopes from wills, etc. I do not say\r\nthat all occupants of the bench are thus influenced, nor to the same\r\nextent; but it certainly is at the best an uphill game to contend in\r\nfavour of a working man in a question which admits of any doubt against\r\nhim. It never happened to me to meet a magistrate who considered that\r\nan agreement among masters not to employ any particular ‘troublesome\r\nfellow’ was an unlawful act; reverse the case, however, and it\r\nimmediately becomes a formidable conspiracy, which must be put down by\r\nthe strong arm of the law, etc.... When I was acting for the Colliers’\r\nUnion in the North we resisted every individual act of oppression, even\r\nin cases where we were sure of losing; and the result was that in a\r\nshort time there was no oppression to resist. For it is to be observed\r\nthat oppression like that we are speaking of--which after all is merely\r\na more genteel and cowardly mode of thieving--shrinks at once from a\r\ndetermined and decided opposition. In the North we should have tried\r\nthis case, first in the County Court, then at the Assizes, and then\r\nperhaps in the Queen’s Bench.”[313]\r\n\r\nOne result of Roberts’ successful advocacy is perhaps to be seen in\r\nthe introduction, during the Parliamentary session of 1844, of a Bill\r\n“for enlarging the powers of justices in determining complaints between\r\nmasters, servants, and artificers,” which the Government got referred\r\nto a committee, by which various extraordinary interpolations were made\r\nin what was at first a harmless measure.[314] Not only was any J.P. to\r\nbe authorised to issue a warrant for the summary arrest of any workman\r\ncomplained of by his employer, but “any misbehaviour concerning such\r\nservice or employment” was to be punished by two months’ imprisonment,\r\nat the discretion of a single justice. It is easy to see what a wide\r\ninterpretation would have been given by many a justice of the peace to\r\nthis vague phrase; and Roberts was not slow to point out the danger to\r\nhis clients. Upon his incitement the delegate meeting of coal-miners\r\nat Sheffield set on foot a vigorous agitation against the Bill, which\r\nhad already slipped through second reading and committee without a\r\ndivision. The Potters’ Union took the matter up with special vigour,\r\nand circulated draft petitions throughout the Midlands.[315] A friendly\r\nmember, Thomas Slingsby Duncombe, obstructed its further progress, and\r\ngot it postponed until after the Easter recess. Meanwhile petitions\r\npoured in upon the astonished House, amounting, it was said, to a\r\ntotal of two hundred, and representing two millions of workmen. When\r\nthe Bill came on again all the Radicals and the “Young England” Tories\r\nwere marshalled against it. Sir James Graham in vain protested that the\r\nGovernment meant nothing more than a consolidation of the existing law,\r\nand led into the lobby all his colleagues who were present, including\r\nMr. Gladstone. But the combination on the other side of Duncombe,\r\nWakley, Hume, and Ferrand, with Tories like Lord John Manners, and a\r\nfew enlightened Whigs such as C. P. Villiers, settled the fate of this\r\nattempt on the part of the employers to sharpen the blunted weapon of\r\nthe law against the hated Trade Unions.[316]\r\n\r\nThe miners were less successful in their strikes than in their legal\r\nand political business. In 1844 their National Conference at Glasgow,\r\nrepresenting 70,000 men, voted, by 28,042 to 23,357, in favour of\r\nstriking against their grievances, and the Durham men, numbering some\r\n30,000, engaged in that prolonged struggle with Lord Londonderry\r\nand their other employers for more equitable terms of hiring and\r\npayment, to which we have already alluded.[317] After many months’\r\nembittered strife the strike failed disastrously; and the great\r\nMiners’ Association, whose proceedings form so important a feature of\r\nthe _Northern Star_ for 1844 and 1845, gradually disappears from its\r\npages, and in the general collapse of the coal trade in 1847-8 it came\r\ncompletely to an end.\r\n\r\nBut the culminating point in this revival of Trade Union activity was\r\nthe formation, at Easter, 1845, of the National Association of United\r\nTrades for the Protection of Labour, an organisation which resuscitated\r\nand combined some of the ideas both of Owen and of Doherty. This\r\nAssociation was explicitly based, as its rules inform us, “upon two\r\ngreat facts: first, that the industrious classes do not receive a\r\nfair day’s wage for a fair day’s labour; and, secondly, that for some\r\nyears past their endeavours to obtain this have, with few exceptions,\r\nbeen unsuccessful. The main causes of this state of things are to\r\nbe found in the isolation of the different sections of working men,\r\nand the absence of a generally recognised and admitted authority\r\nfrom the trades themselves.” But, unlike the Owenite movement of\r\n1833-4, the National Association of United Trades was from the first\r\ndistinguished by the moderation of its aims and the prudence of its\r\nadministration--qualities to which we may attribute its comparatively\r\nlengthy survival for fifteen years. No attempt was made to supersede\r\nexisting organisations of particular trades by a “General Trades\r\nUnion.” “The peculiar local internal and technical circumstances of\r\neach trade,” say the rules, “render it necessary that for all purposes\r\nof efficient internal government its affairs should be administered by\r\npersons possessing a practical knowledge of them. For this reason it\r\nis not intended to interfere with the organisation of existing Trade\r\nUnions.” Moreover, the promoters evidently intended the Association\r\nto become more of a Parliamentary Committee than a federation for\r\ntrade purposes. Its purpose and duty was declared to be “to protect\r\nthe interests and promote the well-being of the associated trades” by\r\nmediation, arbitration, and legal proceedings, and by promoting “all\r\nmeasures, political and social and educational, which are intended to\r\nimprove the condition of the labouring classes.”[318]\r\n\r\nThis new attempt to form a National Federation originated in a\r\nsuggestion from the “United Trades” of Sheffield, embodied in an\r\nable letter written to Duncombe[319] by their secretary, John Drury.\r\nDuncombe had become widely known to the Trade Unionists, not only\r\nthrough his friendship with Fergus O’Connor, and his outspoken support\r\nof Chartism in the House of Commons, but also by his successful\r\nobstruction and defeat of the Masters and Servants Bill of the previous\r\nSession. He appears to have laid Drury’s proposals before the leading\r\nmen in the London Unions, who agreed to form a committee to report on\r\nthe scheme, and to summon a conference of Trade Union delegates from\r\nall parts of the country. At Easter, 1845, 110 delegates, representing\r\nnot only the London trades, but also the Lancashire miners and textile\r\noperatives, the hosiery and woollen-workers of Yorkshire and the\r\nMidlands, and the “United Trades” of Manchester, Sheffield, Norwich,\r\nHull, Bristol, Rochdale, and Yarmouth, met together in London.\r\n\r\nThe preliminary report made to the Conference by the London\r\nCommittee of Trade Delegates is practically the first manifestation\r\nof that spirit of cautious if somewhat limited statesmanship which\r\ncharacterised the Trade Union leaders of the next thirty years.[320]\r\nThe Committee, whilst recommending the immediate formation of a\r\nnational organisation, “to vindicate the rights of labour,” and “to\r\noppose the tyranny of any legislative enactments to coerce trade\r\nsocieties, or of a similar character to the Masters and Servants Bill\r\nof last session, were deeply impressed with the importance of, and\r\nbeneficial tendency arising from, a good understanding between the\r\nemployer and the employed; seeing that their interests are mutual,\r\nand that neither can injure the other without the wrong perpetrated\r\nrecoiling upon the party who inflicts it. They would therefore suggest\r\nit to be one of the principal objects of this Conference to cultivate\r\na good understanding with the employer, and thereby remove those\r\nprejudices which exist against trade combinations, by showing upon\r\nall occasions that they only seek by combination to place themselves\r\nupon equal terms as disposers of their labour with those who purchase\r\nit; to secure themselves from injury, but by no means to inflict it\r\nupon others. Although the Committee are anxious that this desirable\r\nand important organisation should be carried out to the fullest\r\npossible extent, they feel that great caution must be observed in\r\nthe formation of its laws and regulations, in order that the evils\r\nwhich existed and eventually destroyed the Consolidated Union of 1833\r\nshall be carefully avoided. The Committee conceive it necessary to\r\ncall the attention of those trades who are comparatively disunited,\r\nand whose men are consequently working for different rates of wages,\r\nto the great necessity that exists, that those who are receiving the\r\nhighest wages should use every effort within their power to secure to\r\ntheir fellow-workmen a fair remuneration for their labour; and that\r\nevery inducement should be held out by the several trade societies\r\nto their separated brethren to join them, in order that they may be\r\nthe better enabled to make common cause in cases of aggression, which\r\nwould be the certain result if each trade were to form itself into one\r\nwell-regulated society for their mutual interests.... And, finally, the\r\nCommittee would earnestly recommend to this Conference, in order that\r\nthese important points may be considered and dispassionately argued,\r\nthat no proposition of a political nature, beyond what has been already\r\nalluded to, should be introduced, or occupy its attention; convinced\r\nas they are that the only way to carry out these desirable objects\r\nsatisfactorily, and with a due consideration to the best interests of\r\nall those who are concerned, is to consider and dispose of but one\r\nquestion at a time: and, moreover, to keep trade matters and politics\r\nas separate and distinct as circumstances will justify.”[321]\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of this Conference show that the change of front on\r\nthe part of the Trade Union leaders was reflected in the attitude of\r\nthe rank and file. The surviving influence of Owenism is to be traced\r\nin the frequent recurrence of the idea of co-operative production, the\r\ndesire to establish agricultural communities, and the proposal for a\r\nlegislative shortening of the hours of labour. But of the aggressive\r\npolicy and ambitious aims of 1830-34 scarcely a vestige remains.\r\nStrikes were deprecated, and the idea of a general cessation of work\r\nwas entirely abandoned. The projects of co-operative production were\r\non an altogether different plane from Owen’s grand schemes. The Trade\r\nUnionists of the National Conference of 1845 had apparently no vision\r\nof a general transfer of the instruments of production from the\r\ncapitalists to the Trade Unions; co-operative production was regarded\r\nsimply as an auxiliary to Trade Union action, the union workshop\r\nfurnishing a cheap alternative to unproductive strike pay. Besides thus\r\nformally abandoning the methods and pretensions of 1834, the Conference\r\ndeclared its allegiance to a new method of Trade Union activity--the\r\npolicy of conciliation and arbitration. In the demand for “local Boards\r\nof Trade,” a phrase borrowed apparently from the silk-weavers, we\r\nsee the beginning of that system of authoritative mutual negotiation\r\nbetween the representatives of capital and labour which became a very\r\ndistinctive feature of British Trade Unionism in the last half of the\r\nnineteenth century.\r\n\r\nBut the shadow of the failure of 1834 still hung over projects of\r\nuniversal Trade Unions. Although nearly all trades had been represented\r\nat the first conference, most of the larger organisations decided, on\r\nconsideration, to hold aloof from the new body. We find, for instance,\r\nthe Manchester Lodge of the Stonemasons’ Society promptly protesting\r\nagainst the adherence of the society’s delegate, and expressing their\r\nemphatic opinion “that past experience has taught us that we have had\r\ngeneral union enough.” This view was endorsed by the Central Committee,\r\nwhich, in submitting the matter to the votes of the members, observes\r\nthat “there are several trade societies in England as perfectly\r\norganised as ourselves, although their machinery may be somewhat\r\nvarious; but we can hear of none of these societies being desirous to\r\njoin this national movement.... It may be very well for trades who\r\nare divided into sections and have no national organisation amongst\r\nthemselves to join such an association--they have nothing to lose; but\r\nit is a question for serious reflection whether a general union of each\r\ntrade separately would not be far more effective than the heterogeneous\r\nassociation in question.”[322] A similar view seems to have been taken\r\nby the Coal-miners, whose national federation was still in existence. A\r\ndelegate meeting of the newly formed National Typographical Association\r\ndecided by a large majority to remain outside. The Lancashire\r\nCotton-spinners sent a delegate to the adjourned conference, and even\r\nproposed to have perambulating lecturers to explain the advantages of\r\nthe new organisation, but never actually decided to join.[323]\r\n\r\nThe adjourned conference on July 28, 1845, was therefore composed, in\r\nthe main, of the delegates of the smaller or less organised trades.\r\nAbout fifty delegates took part in the proceedings, which extended\r\nover six days. It was eventually decided to separate the Trade Union\r\nfrom the co-operative aims, and to form two distinct but mutually\r\nhelpful associations. The “National Association of United Trades for\r\nthe Protection of Labour” undertook to deal with disputes between\r\nmasters and men, and look after the interests of labour in the House\r\nof Commons. The “National United Trades Association for the Employment\r\nof Labour” proposed to raise capital with which to employ men who\r\nwere on strike under circumstances approved by its twin brother. At\r\nthe second conference, held at Manchester in June 1846, when 126\r\ndelegates, representing, it was said, 40,000 members, were present,\r\nthe contribution to the Trade Association was fixed at twopence in\r\nthe pound of weekly earnings; and it was decided that the strike\r\nallowance should vary from nine shillings up to fourteen shillings per\r\nweek, the latter sum being the wages agreed on for men employed in\r\nthe association’s own workshops. Up to this date no strike had been\r\nsupported, as it was desired to avoid the premature action which had,\r\nit was held, destroyed the Grand National Consolidated Union. A number\r\nof paid organisers were engaged. The Association, which hitherto had\r\nconsisted of woollen and hosiery-workers and of the Midland hardware\r\ntrades, spread in various new directions. The executive of the Friendly\r\nSociety of Operative Carpenters and Joiners--the association that had\r\nplayed so important a part in the movement of 1830--issued a manifesto\r\nto its members in favour of joining, and the general secretary became\r\nan active member of the Executive of the National Association. The\r\nManchester Section of the National Cordwainers’ Society urged all\r\nits members and all societies of boot and shoemakers to join. The\r\nPotters of Staffordshire, the Miners of Scotland, the new-born\r\nNational Association of Tailors, as well as the Metropolitan branches\r\nof the Boilermakers’ and Masons’ Societies came in. The Association,\r\nin fact, became reputed a power in the land, and drew down upon\r\nitself the abusive censure of the _Times_.[324] But in spite of the\r\nwise intentions of its founders, it soon began to suffer from the\r\ncharacteristic complaints of general unions. The depression of trade\r\nwhich began in 1845 brought about during the next two years reductions\r\nof wages, followed by strikes and turn-outs in almost every branch of\r\nindustry. The local committees of the National Association, frequently\r\ncomposed of the officials of the trades concerned, promised their\r\nmembers the support of the national funds, and took umbrage when the\r\nExecutive sitting in London reversed their decisions. Each constituent\r\ntrade felt that its interests were misunderstood, or its grievances\r\nneglected. A prolonged strike of the Manchester building trades in\r\n1846, begun without sanction, failed miserably, the local committee of\r\nthe National Association declaring that the collapse was due to lack of\r\nthe financial support which had been promised on behalf of the central\r\nbody. The coal and iron miners at Holytown in Lanarkshire engaged\r\nin a struggle against their employers which excited the sympathy of\r\nthe Trade Union world, but which ended in failure. An equally severe\r\nconflict by the calico-printers at Crayford in Kent met with no better\r\nsuccess. The Scottish miners complained that they had been inadequately\r\nsupported by the association; and the Lancashire miners made this the\r\npretext for continued abstention.\r\n\r\nThough Duncombe’s association had discouraged strikes, and acted\r\nprincipally as a mediating body, the employers throughout the country\r\nshowed themselves uniformly hostile. The “document” which had figured\r\nso prominently in 1833-4 reappeared in a slightly altered form. The\r\nemployers signified their toleration if not their approval of local\r\ntrade clubs, but condemned with equal acrimony national unions of\r\nparticular trades, or general unions of all trades. Affecting a sudden\r\nconcern for the independence of character of their workmen, they\r\ninsisted that the existence of any kind of central committee, however\r\nrepresentative it might be, prevented the men from being free agents,\r\nand exposed them to the arbitrary commands of an irresponsible body.\r\nIn face of this attitude, the efforts of the National Association to\r\nbring about peaceful settlements met with only qualified success. The\r\nLondon Executive, unable to cope with the applications for assistance\r\nthat poured in daily from all parts of the country, issued strong\r\nadmonitions against unauthorised strikes, but had eventually to\r\ngive or withhold support without sufficient knowledge of the local\r\ncircumstances. Duncombe was principally occupied in drawing up and\r\npresenting petitions in favour of the legislative shortening of the\r\nhours of labour, and in this direction he rendered valuable assistance\r\nto the Lancashire cotton-spinners’ “Short Time Committee,” which\r\nsecured the Ten Hours Act of 1847. The Central Executive was, indeed,\r\nduring these years, more a Parliamentary Committee for the whole\r\nmovement than a federation of Trade Unions. The plan of co-operative\r\nworkshops, from which so much had been expected, proved entirely\r\nfutile in the prolonged contests of the staple trades. One flourishing\r\nboot workshop was started; and the 1847 conference found, in all, one\r\nhundred and twenty-three men at work, the enterprises being confined to\r\nthose trades carried on by hand labour in a small way. In 1848 it was\r\ndecided to merge the two associations in one, and to set about raising\r\n£50,000 in order to start on a larger scale. But before this could\r\nbe attempted the association suffered a double reverse from which it\r\nnever recovered. Duncombe was compelled, by failing health, to withdraw\r\nduring 1848 from active participation in its work. And at the end of\r\nthe following year a strike of the Wolverhampton tinplate-workers\r\ninvolved the National Association in a struggle with employers and with\r\nthe law which drained its funds and destroyed its credit.[325]\r\n\r\nThe later history of the association is obscure.[326] It lingered on\r\nfor many years in a small way, its paid officers serving as advisers\r\nand representatives to a number of minor Trade Unions. Its principal\r\nwork in later years was the promotion and support of bills for the\r\nestablishment of councils of conciliation, and its persistent efforts\r\ncertainly paved the way for the Joint Boards subsequently set on\r\nfoot. But it ceases after 1851 to exercise any influence or play any\r\nimportant part in the Trade Union Movement.\r\n\r\nThe National Association of United Trades stands, in constitution and\r\nobjects, half-way between the revolutionary voluntaryism of 1830-4\r\nand the Parliamentary action of 1863-75. It may, in fact, be regarded\r\neither as a belated “General Trades Union” of an improved type, or as\r\na premature and imperfect Parliamentary Committee of the Trade Union\r\nworld. And although the great national Unions of the time took no\r\npart in its proceedings, its moderate and unaggressive policy was\r\nonly one manifestation of the new spirit which now prevailed in Trade\r\nUnion councils. We see rising up in the Unions of the better-paid\r\nartisans a keen desire to get at the facts of their industrial and\r\nsocial condition. This new feeling for exact knowledge may to some\r\nextent be attributed to the increasing share which the printing trades\r\nwere now beginning to take in the Trade Union Movement. The student\r\nof the reports of the larger compositors’ societies, from the very\r\nbeginning of the century, will be struck, not only by the moderation,\r\nbut also by the elaborate Parliamentary formality--one might almost\r\nsay the stateliness of their proceedings. Instead of rhetorical abuse\r\nof all employers as “the unproductive classes,” and total abstinence\r\nfrom investigation of the details of disputes, we find the compositors\r\ndealing only with concrete instances of hardship, and referring every\r\nimportant question to a “Select Committee” for inquiry and report.\r\nIn 1848 the London Consolidated Society of Bookbinders, established\r\nin 1786, used part of its funds to form a library for the benefit\r\nof its members. By 1851 a reading-room furnished with daily and\r\nweekly newspapers had been opened. Four years later a similar library\r\nwas established by the London Society of Compositors. In 1842, the\r\nJourneymen Steam-Engine and Machine Makers’ Friendly Society started\r\na Mutual Improvement Class at Manchester. Even the Stonemasons, at\r\nthat time a rough and somewhat turbulent body, were reached by the new\r\ndesire for self-improvement. The Glasgow branch of the Scottish United\r\nOperative Masons report with pride, in 1845, that they have “formed a\r\nclass for mutual instruction ... an association for moral, physical,\r\nand intellectual improvement” which was setting itself to investigate\r\nthe question--“Is the present improved condition of machinery\r\nbeneficial to the working classes, or is it hurtful?”[327] But the\r\nmost effective outcome of this desire for information was the starting\r\nby the Unions of special trade journals. The United Branches of the\r\nOperative Potters set on foot in 1843 the _Potters’ Examiner_, a weekly\r\nnewspaper which dealt with the trade interests and technical processes\r\nof their industry.[328] The Journeymen Steam-Engine and Machine Makers’\r\nFriendly Society issued the _Mechanics’ Magazine_ between 1841 and\r\n1847. In November 1850 Dunning persuaded the London Consolidated\r\nSociety of Bookbinders to publish the _Bookbinders’ Trade Circular_,\r\nin the pages of which he promulgated a theory of Trade Unionism, from\r\nwhich McCulloch himself would scarcely have dissented,[329] and made\r\nthat humble organ of his society into a monthly magazine of useful\r\ninformation on all matters connected with books and their manufacture.\r\nBut the best of these trade publications, and the only one which\r\nhas enjoyed a continuous existence down to the present day, was the\r\n_Flint Glass Makers’ Magazine_, an octavo monthly of ninety-six pages,\r\nestablished at Birmingham in 1850 by the Flint Glass Makers’ Friendly\r\nSociety,[330] which advocated “the education of every man in our trade,\r\nbeginning at the oldest and coming down to the youngest.... If you do\r\nnot wish to stand as you are and suffer more oppression,” it enjoined\r\nits readers, “we say to you get knowledge, and in getting knowledge you\r\nget power.... Let us earnestly advise you to educate; get intelligence\r\ninstead of alcohol--it is sweeter and more lasting.”[331]\r\n\r\nWith increased acquaintance with industrial conditions came a reaction\r\nagainst the policy of reckless aggression which marked the Owenite\r\ninflation. Here again we find the printing trades taking the lead.\r\nAlready in 1835, when the London Compositors were reorganising their\r\nsociety, the committee went out of their way to denounce the great\r\ngeneral Unions. “Unfortunately almost all Trades Unions hitherto\r\nformed,” they report to their members, “have relied for success upon\r\nextorted oaths and physical force.... The fault and the destruction\r\nof all Trades Unions has hitherto been that they have copied the\r\nvices which they professed to condemn. While disunited and powerless\r\nthey have stigmatised their employers as grasping taskmasters; but as\r\nsoon as they (the workmen) were united and powerful, then they became\r\ntyrants in their turn, and unreasonably endeavoured to exact more\r\nthan the nature of their employment demanded, or than their employers\r\ncould afford to give. Hence their failure was inevitable.... Let the\r\nCompositors of London show the Artisans of England a brighter and\r\nbetter example; and casting away the aid to be derived from cunning\r\nand brute strength, let us, when we contend with our opponents, employ\r\nonly the irresistible weapons of truth and reason.”[332] The disasters\r\nof 1837-42 caused this spirit to spread to other trades. From this\r\ntime forth the minutes and circulars of the larger Unions abound in\r\nimpressive warnings against aggressive action. “Strikes are prolific,”\r\nsay the delegates of the Ironmoulders in council assembled; “in certain\r\ncases they beget others.... How often have disputes been averted by\r\na few timely words with employers! It is surely no dishonour to\r\nexplain to your employer the nature and extent of your grievance.”[333]\r\nThe Stonemasons’ Central Committee repeatedly caution their members\r\n“against the dangerous practice of striking.... Keep from it,” they\r\nurge, “as you would from a ferocious animal that you know would destroy\r\nyou.... Remember what it was that made us so insignificant in 1842....\r\nWe implore you, brethren, as you value your own existence, to avoid, in\r\nevery way possible, those useless strikes. Let us have another year of\r\nearnest and attentive organisation; and, if that does not perfect us,\r\nwe must have another; for it is a knowledge of the disorganised state\r\nof working men generally that stimulates the tyrant and the taskmaster\r\nto oppress them.”[334] A few years later the Liverpool lodge invites\r\nthe support of all the members for the proposition “that our society\r\nno longer recognise strikes, either as a means to be adopted for\r\nimproving our condition, or as a scheme to be resorted to in resisting\r\ninfringements,”[335] and suggests, as an alternative, the formation\r\nof an Emigration Fund. The Portsmouth lodge caps this proposal by\r\ninsisting not only that strikes should cease, but also that the word\r\n“strike” be abolished! The _Flint Glass Makers’ Magazine_, between\r\n1850 and 1855, is full of similar denunciations. “We believe,” writes\r\nthe editor, “that strikes have been the bane of Trades Unions.”[336]\r\nIn 1854 the Flint Glass Makers, on the proposition of the Central\r\nCommittee, abolished the allowance of “strike-money” by a vote of the\r\nwhole of the members. As an alternative it was often suggested that a\r\nbad employer should be defeated by quietly withdrawing the men one by\r\none, as situations could be found for them elsewhere. “As man after\r\nman leaves, and no one [comes] to supply their place, then it is that\r\nthe proud and haughty spirit of the oppressor is brought down, and he\r\nfeels the power he cannot see.”[337]\r\n\r\nIt was part of the same policy of restricting the use of the weapon\r\nof the strike that the power of declaring war on the employers was,\r\nduring these years, taken away from the local branches. In the two\r\ngreat societies of which we have complete records--the Ironmoulders\r\nand the Stonemasons--we see a gradual tightening up of the control\r\nof the central executive. The Delegate Meeting of the Ironmoulders\r\nin 1846 vested the entire authority in the Executive Committee. “The\r\nsystem,” they report, “of allowing disputes to be sanctioned by\r\nmeetings of our members, generally labouring under some excitement or\r\nother, or misled by a plausible letter from the scene of the dispute,\r\nis decidedly bad. Our members do not feel that responsibility on these\r\noccasions which they ought. They are liable to be misled. A clever\r\nspeech, party feeling, a misrepresentation, or a specious letter--all\r\nor any of these may involve a shop, or a whole branch, in a dispute,\r\nunjustly and possibly without the least chance of obtaining their\r\nobject.... Impressed with the truth of these opinions, we have handed\r\nover for the future the power of sanctioning disputes to the Executive\r\nCommittee alone.”[338] The Stonemasons’ Central Committee, after 1843,\r\nperemptorily forbid lodges to strike shops, even if they do not mean\r\nto charge the society’s funds with strike-pay. And though in this\r\nUnion, unlike the Ironmoulders, the decision to strike or not to strike\r\nwas not vested in the Executive, any lodge had to submit its demand,\r\nthrough the _Fortnightly Circular_, to the vote of the whole body of\r\nmembers throughout the kingdom--a procedure which involved delay and\r\ngave the Central Committee an opportunity of using its influence in\r\nfavour of peace.\r\n\r\nThe fact that most of the Executive Committees were, from 1845 onward,\r\nsetting their face against strikes, did not imply the abandonment of\r\nan energetic trade policy. The leaders of the better educated trades\r\nhad accepted the economic axiom that wages must inevitably depend\r\nupon the relation of Supply and Demand in each particular class of\r\nlabour. It seemed an obvious inference that the only means in their\r\npower to maintain or improve their condition was to diminish the\r\nsupply. “All men of experience agree,” affirms the Delegate Meeting\r\nof the Ironmoulders in 1847, “that wages are to be best raised by\r\nthe demand for labour.” Hence we find the denunciations of strikes\r\naccompanied by an insistence on the limitation of apprentices, the\r\nabolition of overtime, and the provision of an Emigration Fund. The\r\nFlint Glass Makers declare that “the scarcity of labour was one of\r\nthe fundamental principles laid down at our first conference held in\r\nManchester in 1849.” “It is simply a question of supply and demand, and\r\nwe all know that if we supply a greater quantity of an article than\r\nwhat is actually demanded that the cheapening of that article, whether\r\nit be labour or any other commodity, is a natural result.”[339] In\r\nthis application of the doctrine of Supply and Demand the Flint Glass\r\nMakers were joined by the Compositors, Bookbinders, Ironmoulders,\r\nPotters, and, as we shall presently see, the Engineers.[340] For the\r\nnext ten years an Emigration Fund becomes a constant feature of many\r\nof the large societies, to be abandoned only when it was discovered\r\nthat the few thousands of pounds which could be afforded for this\r\npurpose produced no visible effect in diminishing the surplus labour.\r\nMoreover, it was the vigorous and energetic member who applied for\r\nhis passage-money, whilst the chronically unemployed, if he could be\r\npersuaded to go at all, frequently reappeared at the clubhouse after a\r\nbrief trip at the society’s expense.[341]\r\n\r\nThe harmless but ineffective expedient of emigration was accompanied\r\nby the more equivocal plan of closing the trade to new-comers. The\r\nFlint Glass Makers, like the other sections of the glass trade, have\r\nalways been notorious for their strict limitation of the number of\r\napprentices. The constant refrain of their trade organ is “Look to the\r\nrule and keep boys back; for this is the foundation of the evil, the\r\nsecret of our progress, the dial on which our society works, and the\r\nhope of future generations.”[342] The printing trades were equally\r\nactive. Select Committees of the London Society of Compositors were\r\nconstantly inquiring into the most effective way of checking boy-labour\r\nand regulating “turnover” apprentices. And the engineering trades,\r\nat this time entering the Trade Union world, were basing their whole\r\npolicy on the assumption that the duly apprenticed mechanic, like the\r\ndoctor or the solicitor, had a right to exclude “illegal men” from his\r\noccupation.\r\n\r\nSuch was the “New Spirit” which, by 1850, was dominating the Trade\r\nUnion world. Meanwhile the steady growth of national Unions, each with\r\nthree to five thousand members, ever-increasing friendly benefits, and\r\na weekly contribution per member which sometimes exceeded a shilling,\r\ninvolved a considerable development of Trade Union structure. The\r\nlittle clubs and local societies had been managed, in the main, by men\r\nworking at their trades, and attending to their secretarial duties\r\nin the evening. With the growth of such national organisations as\r\nthe Stonemasons, the Ironmoulders, and the Steam-Engine Makers, the\r\nmere volume of business necessitated the appointment of one of the\r\nmembers to devote his whole time to the correspondence and accounts.\r\nBut the new official, however industrious and well-meaning, found upon\r\nhis hands a task for which neither his education nor his temperament\r\nhad fitted him. The archives of these societies reveal the pathetic\r\nstruggles of inexperienced workmen to cope with the difficulties\r\npresented by the combination of branch management and centralised\r\nfinance. The disbursement of friendly benefits by branch meetings, the\r\ncustody and remittance of the funds, the charges for local expenses\r\n(including “committee liquor”),[343] the mysteries of bookkeeping, and\r\nthe intricacies of audit all demanded a new body of officers specially\r\nselected for and exclusively engaged in this work. During these years\r\nwe watch a shifting of leadership in the Trade Union world from the\r\ncasual enthusiast and irresponsible agitator to a class of permanent\r\nsalaried officers expressly chosen from out of the rank and file of\r\nTrade Unionists for their superior business capacity. But besides\r\nthe daily work of administration, the expansion of local societies\r\ninto organisations of national extent, and the transformation of\r\nloose federations into consolidated unions, involved the difficult\r\nprocess of constitution-making. The records of the Ironmoulders and\r\nthe Stonemasons show with what anxious solicitude successive Delegate\r\nMeetings were groping after a set of rules that would work smoothly\r\nand efficiently. One Union, however, the Journeymen Steam-Engine\r\nand Machine Makers and Millwrights’ Friendly Society, tackled the\r\nproblems of internal organisation with peculiar ability, and eventually\r\nproduced, in the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, a “New Model” of the\r\nutmost importance to Trade Union history.\r\n\r\nTo understand the rise of this remarkable society, we must revert\r\nto the earlier history of combinations which have hitherto scarcely\r\nclaimed attention in our account of the general movement. The origin\r\nof Trade Unionism in the engineering trades is obscure. We learn\r\nthat at the close of the last century the then dominant class of\r\nmillwrights possessed strong, exclusive, and even tyrannical trade\r\nsocieties, the chief of them being the “London Fellowship,” meeting at\r\nthe Bell Inn, Old Bailey.[344] The millwrights, who were originally\r\nconstructors of mill-work of every kind, both wood and iron, were,\r\non the introduction of the steam-engine, gradually superseded by\r\nspecialised workers in particular sections of their trade. The\r\nintroduction of what was termed “the engineer’s economy,” that is to\r\nsay, the parcelling out of the trade of the millwright among distinct\r\nclasses of workmen, and the substitution of “payment according to\r\nmerit” for the millwrights’ Standard Rate, completely disorganised\r\nthe skilled mechanics of the engineering trade. This condition was\r\nnot materially improved by the establishment, from 1822 onward, of\r\nnumerous competing Trade Friendly Societies. The Ironmoulders alone\r\nconcentrated their efforts upon maintaining one national society.\r\nThe millwrights, smiths, pattern-makers, and other skilled mechanics\r\nengaged in engine and machine making had societies in London,\r\nManchester, Newcastle, Bradford, Derby, and other engineering centres.\r\nOf these the Steam-Engine Makers (established 1824); the Journeymen\r\nSteam-Engine and Machine Makers and Millwrights (established 1826); the\r\nAssociated Fraternity of Iron Forgers, usually called the “Old Smiths”\r\n(established 1830); and the Boilermakers (established 1832) are known\r\nto have been organisations of national extent, with branches in all\r\nparts of the country, competing, not only with each other, but with\r\nthe Metropolitan and other local societies of Millwrights, Smiths,\r\nPatternmakers, and General Engineers. This anarchic rivalry prevented\r\nany effectual trade action, and tempted employers to give the work to\r\nthe lowest bidder, and to introduce the worst features of competitive\r\npiecework and sub-contract.\r\n\r\nWe are, therefore, not surprised to find that the engineers’ societies\r\ntook little part in the great upheaval of 1830-4. But the wave of\r\nsolidarity which then swept over the labour world seems to have had\r\nconsiderable, though tardy, effect even in this trade. The chief\r\ndistricts affected were London and Lancashire. In 1836 a London\r\njoint committee of several of the sectional societies successfully\r\nconducted an eight months’ strike for a shortening of the hours of\r\nlabour to sixty per week, and for extra payment for overtime. Again,\r\nin 1844 a joint committee obtained from the London employers a further\r\nreduction of hours. Encouraged by these successes, the members of the\r\nMetropolitan societies and branches began to discuss the possibility\r\nof a national amalgamation. The most prominent personality in this\r\nmovement was that of William Newton,[345] a leading member of the\r\nJourneymen Steam-Engine and Machine Makers and Millwrights’ Friendly\r\nSociety, the association which afterwards became, as we shall see, the\r\nparent of the amalgamation.\r\n\r\nWilliam Newton had exactly the qualities needed for his task. Gifted\r\nwith remarkable eloquence, astute and conciliatory in his methods,\r\nhe was equally successful in inspiring masses of men with a large\r\nidea, and in persuading the representatives and officials of rival\r\nsocieties to agree with the details of his scheme. His influence\r\nwas augmented by his tried devotion to the cause of Trade Unionism.\r\nIn 1848 he was dismissed from a first-rate position as foreman in a\r\nlarge establishment owing to his activity in trade matters, and in the\r\nfollowing years his business as a publican was seriously damaged by his\r\nconstant absence on society business. But though from the first he had\r\nbeen an active member of his Union, and was for many years a Branch\r\nSecretary, he was, so far as we know, at no time its full-time salaried\r\nofficial. He stands, therefore, midway between the casual and amateur\r\nleaders of the old Trade Unionism and the new class of permanent\r\nofficials, sticking closely to office work, and acquiring a detailed\r\nexperience in Trade Union organisation.\r\n\r\nWhilst Newton was bringing the London societies into line, the\r\nLancashire engineers were moving in the same direction. Already in\r\n1839 a “committee of the engineering trades” at Bolton urged upon\r\ntheir comrades the establishment of “one concentrated union”; and in\r\nthe following year, through the energy of Alexander Hutchinson, the\r\nsecretary of the Friendly United Smiths of Great Britain and Ireland,\r\na United Trades Association was set on foot in Lancashire, to comprise\r\nthe “Five Trades of Mechanism, viz. Mechanics, Smiths, Moulders,\r\nEngineers, and Millwrights.” The objects of this association were\r\nably represented and promoted by its organ, the _Trades Journal_,\r\nestablished to extend and “improve Trades Unions generally in Great\r\nBritain and Ireland,”[346] The attempt proved, however, premature,\r\nand it was not until the year 1844 that the Bolton men, under the\r\nleadership of John Rowlinson, succeeded in establishing a permanent\r\n“Protection Society,” composed of delegates from the Societies of\r\nSmiths, Millwrights, Ironmoulders, Engineers, and Boilermakers.\r\nInspirited by the success of the Bolton society, which successfully\r\nmaintained a nine months’ strike (costing it £9,000) against the\r\n“Quittance Paper” (character note, or leaving certificate) which the\r\nemployers eventually agreed to abandon, joint committees of engineering\r\noperatives were formed between 1844 and 1850 in all the principal\r\nLancashire centres. These were repeatedly addressed by Rowlinson and\r\nHutchinson, and the ground was prepared for a systematic attempt at\r\nnational amalgamation.\r\n\r\nThe leading part in the amalgamation was taken by the society to which\r\nNewton belonged. The Journeymen Steam-Engine and Machine Makers and\r\nMillwrights’ Friendly Society, with its headquarters at Manchester,\r\nat this time far exceeded any other trade society in membership and\r\nwealth. Established in 1826 as the Friendly Union of Mechanics, it\r\nhad absorbed in 1837 a strong Yorkshire society dating from 1822 (the\r\nMechanics’ Friendly Union Institution), and by 1848 it numbered seven\r\nthousand members organised in branches all over the kingdom, and\r\npossessed an accumulated reserve fund of £25,000. The silent growth\r\nof this Union, the slow perfecting of its constitution by repeated\r\ndelegate meetings held at intervals during the preceding twenty years,\r\nstand in marked contrast with the dramatic advent of the ephemeral\r\norganisations of 1830-34. But this task of internal organisation, with\r\nits gradual working out of the elaborate financial and administrative\r\nsystem which afterwards became celebrated in the constitution of the\r\nAmalgamated Engineers, seems to have absorbed, during the first fifteen\r\nyears of its existence, all the energy of its members. In none of the\r\nworking-class movements of this period did the society play any part,\r\nnor do we find that it, as a whole, engaged in any important conflicts\r\nwith its members’ employers. At last, in 1843, a delegate meeting urged\r\nthe members to oppose systematic overtime, and in 1844 the society,\r\nas we have seen, took part in the London movement for the shortening\r\nof the hours of labour. By 1845 it seems to have felt itself strong\r\nenough to undertake aggressive trade action by itself, and a delegate\r\nmeeting in that year attacked the employment of labourers on machines,\r\n“the piece master system,” and systematic overtime, by stringent\r\nresolutions upon which the Executive Committee sitting at Manchester\r\nwere directed to take early action.[347] During the following year\r\naccordingly a simultaneous attempt appears to have been made by many\r\nof the branches to enforce these rules. This action led, at Belfast,\r\nRochdale, and Newton-le-Willows, to legal proceedings by the employers,\r\nand the officers of the society, together with over a score of its\r\nmembers, found themselves in the dock indicted for conspiracy and\r\nillegal combination.[348] The trial of the twenty-six engineers of\r\nNewton-le-Willows, and the conviction of nine of them, including\r\nSelsby, the General Secretary of the great mechanics’ Union, caused a\r\nsensation in the Trade Union world, and tended to draw closer together\r\nthe rival societies in the engineering trade.\r\n\r\nThe progressive trade policy of the Journeymen Steam-Engine and\r\nMachine Makers’ Society greatly increased the ascendency which its\r\nsuperiority in wealth and numbers gave it over the numerous other\r\ntrade friendly societies in the engineering trades. William Allan,\r\na young Scotchman, succeeded Selsby in the salaried post of general\r\nsecretary when the latter obtained a commercial post in 1848. A close\r\nfriend and ardent disciple of William Newton, he quickly manifested,\r\nin the administration of his own society, the capacity and energy\r\nwhich enabled him in future years to play so important a part in the\r\ngeneral history of the Labour Movement. The cause of amalgamation was\r\nwell served by the indefatigable missionary efforts of these two men.\r\nThe anniversary dinners and friendly social meetings of the joint\r\ncommittees of the societies in the Lancashire iron trades were, as\r\nwe know from contemporary records, made the occasion of propagandist\r\nspeeches, and were doubtless used also by these astute organisers\r\nto talk over the leading men to agreement with their proposals. The\r\nnatural jealousy felt by the great provincial centre of Trade Unionism\r\nof the interference of the Metropolis in its concerns was allayed\r\nby Allan’s suggestion that the Lancashire societies should call a\r\nconference of delegates at Warrington in March 1850, for the purpose\r\nof consultation and discussion only. At this meeting, which was\r\nattended only by the representatives of three of the larger societies\r\n(including the Steam-Engine Makers established at Liverpool in 1824,\r\nand the Smiths’ Benevolent, Friendly, Sick and Burial Society,\r\nestablished in 1830), Newton and Allan succeeded in getting through\r\nthe outlines of their scheme of amalgamation. During the next six\r\nmonths these proposals were the subject of exhaustive discussion at\r\nevery joint committee and branch meeting. Meanwhile the leaders had\r\nestablished in Manchester a weekly journal for the express purpose of\r\npromoting amalgamation, engaging as editor, under a written contract,\r\nDr. John Watts, afterwards well known as one of the ablest advocates\r\nof co-operation. This journal, the _Trades Advocate and Herald of\r\nProgress_, stated to be “established by the Iron Trades,” discussed\r\nthe advantages of union, and incidentally taught the doctrines of Free\r\nTrade and Co-operative Production.[349]\r\n\r\nLancashire converted and conciliated, London could now go ahead.\r\nUnder Newton’s influence the London joint committee summoned a second\r\ndelegate meeting at Birmingham in September 1850, which was attended\r\nby representatives of seven engineering societies. At this conference\r\nthe scheme of amalgamation was definitely adopted; and the Metropolitan\r\n“Central Committee” was charged, as a “Provisional Committee,” to\r\ncomplete the details of the transfer of the old organisation to the new\r\nbody. The tact and skill with which Allan and Newton carried out their\r\nproject are conspicuously shown by the way in which the act of union\r\nwas regarded by all concerned. There is no trace of suspicion on the\r\npart of the minor societies that they were taking part in anything but\r\nan amalgamation on equal terms. The whole Trade Union world, including\r\nthe Amalgamated Society of Engineers itself, has retained the tradition\r\nthat this great organisation was the outcome of a genuine amalgamation\r\nof societies of fairly equivalent standing. What happened, as a\r\nmatter of fact, was that the society led by Allan and Newton absorbed\r\nits rivals.[350] The new body took over, in its entirety, the\r\nelaborate constitution, the scheme of benefits (with the addition\r\nof Sick Benefit and the adoption of the innovation of an Emigration\r\nBenefit of £6), the trade policy, and even the official staff of the\r\nJourneymen Steam-Engine and Machine Makers and Millwrights’ Society,\r\nwhich contributed more than three-fourths of the membership with which\r\nthe amalgamation started, and found itself continued, down to the\r\nminutest details, in the rules and regulations of the new association.\r\nAn important addition was, however, the adoption of a definite\r\ntrade policy of restricting overtime and preventing piecework; the\r\ninstitution of District Committees charged to carry out that policy;\r\nand the establishment of a new Strike Pay of 15s. per week.\r\n\r\nThe conclusions of the Birmingham delegates were not accepted without\r\ndemur. Many of the branches in Lancashire and elsewhere objected to\r\nthe position obtained by the London Committee, and stood aloof from\r\nthe amalgamation. The Manchester Committee showed signs of jealousy at\r\nthe transfer of the seat of government to the Metropolis. But the most\r\nimportant defection was that of the rank and file of the members of the\r\nSteam-Engine Makers’ Society, an association which stood in membership\r\nand funds second only to the Journeymen Steam-Engine Makers and Machine\r\nMakers’ Society. Newton and Allan had succeeded in persuading the whole\r\nof the Executive to throw in their lot with the amalgamation, but the\r\nbulk of the members revolted, and the society maintained a separate\r\nexistence down to the end of 1919, when it joined the other societies\r\nin the creation of the Amalgamated Engineering Union. Even in Newton’s\r\nown society, in which the main principles of the amalgamation had been\r\ncarried by large majorities, a considerable number of the provincial\r\nbranches remained hostile. On January 6, 1851, when the Provisional\r\nCommittee formally assumed office as the Executive Committee of the\r\n“Amalgamated Society of Engineers, Machinists, Smiths, Millwrights and\r\nPatternmakers,” scarcely 5000 members out of the 10,500 represented at\r\nthe Birmingham Conference were paying to the amalgamated funds.[351]\r\nFor some months, indeed, the success of Newton’s ambitious scheme\r\nlooked doubtful. Though London had rallied to his help, only one small\r\nsociety standing aloof, the provincial branches came in very slowly.\r\nIt took three months’ persuasion to raise the membership of the\r\namalgamation up to the level of the parent society. Delegate meetings\r\nof the Steam-Engine Makers and the Smiths’ Societies decided against\r\namalgamation, though many of their branches broke away and joined the\r\nnew society. But towards the end of May the tide turned. The remaining\r\nbranches of the Journeymen Steam-Engine and Machine Makers and\r\nMillwrights’ Society held a delegate meeting, at which it was decided\r\nno longer to oppose the amalgamation; the Smiths’ Society of London and\r\nseveral other small societies came in; and by October Newton and Allan\r\nwere at the head of a united society of 11,000 members paying 1s. per\r\nweek each, the largest and most powerful Union that had ever existed in\r\nthe engineering trades, and far exceeding in membership, and still more\r\nin annual income, any other trade society of the time.[352]\r\n\r\nThe successful accomplishment of the amalgamation was followed by a\r\nconflict with the employers, which riveted the attention of the whole\r\nTrade Union world upon the new body. The aggressive trade policy\r\ninitiated by Selsby and Allan in Lancashire and Newton in London\r\nhad been repeatedly confirmed by the delegate meetings of their\r\nsociety, and was formally incorporated in the basis of the larger\r\norganisation.[353] The more energetic branches were not slow in acting\r\nupon it. In 1851 the men at Messrs. Hibbert & Platt’s extensive works\r\nat Oldham made a series of demands, not only for the abolition of\r\novertime, but also for the exclusion of “labourers and other ‘illegal’\r\nmen” from the machines. With these demands Messrs. Hibbert & Platt\r\nand other employers had to comply. The private minutes of the London\r\nExecutive prove conclusively that the strike to oust labourers from\r\nmachines was not authorised by the central body;[354] but as William\r\nNewton, now a member of the Executive, acted as the representative\r\nof the Oldham men in submitting these demands to Messrs. Hibbert &\r\nPlatt, the employers, naturally inferring that his action was the\r\ndirect outcome of the amalgamation, formed in December 1851 the Central\r\nAssociation of Employers of Operative Engineers to resist the men’s\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the London Executive had been consulting the whole of\r\nthe members on the proposal to abolish systematic overtime and\r\npiecework, and had obtained an almost unanimous vote in favour of\r\nimmediate action. A manifesto was issued to the employers, in which\r\nthe Executive announced the intention of the society to put an end\r\nto piecework and systematic overtime after December 31, 1851. The\r\nemployers replied by an imperious declaration in the _Times_ that a\r\nstrike at any one establishment would be met seven days later by a\r\ngeneral lock-out of the whole engineering trade. The men thereupon\r\noffered to submit the question to arbitration, a proposal which the\r\nemployers ignored. On January 1, 1852, the members of the Amalgamated\r\nSociety refused to work overtime, and on the 10th the masters closed,\r\nas they had threatened, every important engineering establishment in\r\nLancashire and the Metropolis.\r\n\r\nThe three months’ struggle that followed interested the general public\r\nmore than any previous conflict. The details were described, and the\r\naction of the employers and the policy of the Union was discussed in\r\nevery newspaper. The men found unexpected friends in the little group\r\nof “Christian Socialists,” who threw themselves heartily into the fray,\r\nand rendered excellent service, not only by liberal subscriptions,[355]\r\nbut also by letters to the newspapers, public lectures, and other\r\nexplanations of the men’s position. The masters remained obdurate,\r\ninsisting not only upon the unconditional withdrawal of the men’s\r\ndemands, but also upon their signing the well-known “document”\r\nforswearing Trade Union membership. The capitalists, in fact, took\r\nup the old line of absolute supremacy in their establishments, and\r\nexpressly denied the men’s right to take any collective action\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the subscription of £4000 by the public and £5000 by\r\nother trade societies, the funds at the disposal of the Union soon\r\nbegan to run short. The Executive had undertaken to support not only\r\nthe 3500 of its own members and the 1500 mechanics who were out, but\r\nalso the 10,000 labourers who had been made idle. Altogether over\r\n£43,000 was dispensed during the six months in out-of-work pay. Early\r\nin February the masters opened their workshops. By the middle of March\r\nthe issue of the struggle was plain, and during April the men resumed\r\nwork on the employers’ terms. Almost all the masters insisted on the\r\nactual signature of the “document” by their men, and most of these,\r\nunder pressure of imminent destitution, reluctantly submitted, without,\r\nhowever, carrying out their promise by abandoning the Union. Judge\r\nHughes, writing in 1860, describes this act of bad faith by the men as\r\n“inexcusable,” but there is much to be said for the view taken by the\r\nAmalgamation Executive, who declared that they held themselves “and\r\nevery man who unwillingly puts his hand to that detestable document\r\nwhich is forced upon us to be as much destitute of that power of choice\r\nwhich should precede a contract as if a pistol were at his head and he\r\nhad to choose between death and degradation.”[356] A promise extorted\r\nunder “duress” carries with it little legal and still less moral\r\nobligation, and whatever discredit attaches to the transaction must be\r\nascribed at least as much to the masters who made the demand as to the\r\nunfortunate victims of the labour war who unwillingly complied with\r\nit.[357]\r\n\r\nIt was the dramatic events of 1852 which made the establishment of the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Engineers a turning-point in the history of the\r\nTrade Union Movement. The complete victory gained by the employers did\r\nnot, as they had hoped, destroy the Engineers’ Union. The membership\r\nof the society was, in fact, never seriously shaken.[358] On the other\r\nhand, the publicity which it gained in the conflict gave it a position\r\nof unrivalled prominence in the Trade Union world. From 1852 to 1889\r\nthe elaborate constitution of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers\r\nserved as the model for all new national trade societies, whilst old\r\norganisations found themselves gradually incorporating its leading\r\nfeatures. The place occupied in 1830-34 by the cotton-spinners and the\r\nbuilders was, in fact, now taken by the iron trades.\r\n\r\nThe “New Model” thus introduced differed, both for good and evil, from\r\nthe typical Trade Unionism of the preceding generation. The engineering\r\nsocieties had to some extent inherited the exclusive policy of the\r\norganisations of the skilled handicraftsmen of the beginning of the\r\ncentury. Unlike the General Trades Unions of 1830-34 they restricted\r\ntheir membership to legally apprenticed workmen. Their records bear\r\ntraces of the old idea of the legal incorporation of separate trades,\r\nrather than of any general union of “the productive classes.” The\r\ngenerous but impracticable “universalism” of the Owenite and Chartist\r\norganisations was replaced by the principle of the protection of the\r\nvested interests of the craftsman in his occupation. The preface to the\r\nrules of the parent society expresses this dominant idea by a forcible\r\nanalogy:\r\n\r\n“The youth who has the good fortune and inclination for preparing\r\nhimself as a useful member of society by the study of physic, and who\r\nstudies that profession with success so as to obtain his diploma from\r\nthe Surgeons’ Hall or College of Surgeons, naturally expects, in some\r\nmeasure, that he is entitled to privileges to which the pretending\r\nquack can lay no claim; and if in the practice of that useful\r\nprofession he finds himself injured by such a pretender, he has the\r\npower of instituting a course of law against him. Such are the benefits\r\nconnected with the learned professions. But the mechanic, though he may\r\nexpend nearly an equal fortune and sacrifice an equal proportion of\r\nhis life in becoming acquainted with the different branches of useful\r\nmechanism, has no law to protect his privileges.”[359] He is therefore\r\nurged to join the society, which aims at securing the same protection\r\nof his trade against interlopers as is enjoyed by the learned\r\nprofessions.\r\n\r\nThis spirit of exclusiveness has had, as we shall hereafter discern,\r\nan equivocal effect, not only on the history of the society itself,\r\nbut on that of the Trade Union Movement. But the contemporary trade\r\nmovements either did not observe or failed to realise the tendency\r\nof this attempt to retain or reconstruct an aristocracy of skilled\r\nworkmen. What impressed the working men was not the trade policy which\r\nhad brought about the defeat of 1852, but the admirably thought-out\r\nfinancial and administrative system, which enabled the Union to combine\r\nthe functions of a trade protection society with those of a permanent\r\ninsurance company, and thus attain a financial stability hitherto\r\nundreamt of. Time proved that this constitution had its peculiar\r\ndefects. But for over twenty years no Trade Unionist questioned its\r\nexcellence, and the minute criticism and heated abuse which it evoked\r\nfrom employers and their advocates seemed only another testimony to\r\nits effectiveness. We think it worth while, therefore, at the risk of\r\nintroducing tedious detail, to describe the main features of this “New\r\nModel.”\r\n\r\nIn striking contrast with the Cotton-spinners’ and Builders’ Unions\r\nof 1830-34, with their exclusively trade purposes, the societies\r\nin the engineering trades had, like the trade organisations of the\r\nhandicraftsmen of the last century, originated as local benefit clubs.\r\nThe Journeymen Steam-Engine Makers’ Society, for instance, had from\r\nthe first provided its members with out-of-work pay, a travelling\r\nallowance, a funeral benefit, and a lump sum in case of accidental\r\ndisablement. In 1846 it added to these benefits a small sick allowance,\r\nand shortly afterwards an old age pension to superannuated members.\r\nThe administration of these friendly benefits was from the outset the\r\nprimary object of the organisation. As the local benefit club expanded\r\ninto a national society by the migration of its members from town to\r\ntown, the extreme difficulty of combining local autonomy with a just\r\nand economical administration of extensive benefits became apparent.\r\nFor the society, it must be remembered, was not a federation of\r\nindependent bodies, each having its own exchequer and contributing to\r\nthe central fund its determinate quota of the expenses of the central\r\noffice: it was from the first a single association with a common\r\npurse, into which all contributions were paid, and out of which all\r\nexpenditure, down to the stationery and ink used by a branch secretary,\r\nwas defrayed. This concentration of funds carried with it the practical\r\nadvantage of forming a considerable reserve at the disposal of the\r\nExecutive. But so long as it was combined with local autonomy, it was\r\nopen to the obvious objection that a branch might dispense benefits to\r\nits own members with undue liberality, and thus absorb an unfair amount\r\nof the moneys of the whole society. And hence we find that in 1838 an\r\nattempt was made to centralise the administration, by transforming the\r\nlocal officials from the servants of the branches into agents of the\r\ncentral authority. The inherent love of self-government of the British\r\nartisan defeated this proposal, which would inevitably have led to\r\nlocal apathy and suspicion, if not to grosser evils. Some other method\r\nof harmonising local autonomy with centralised finance had therefore to\r\nbe invented.\r\n\r\nUnder the constitution which the Amalgamated Society took over from the\r\nJourneymen Steam-Engine and Machine Makers and Millwrights, we find\r\nthis problem solved with considerable astuteness. The branch elects and\r\ncontrols its own local officers, but acts in all cases within rules\r\nwhich provide explicitly for every detail. Each branch retains its own\r\nfunds and administers the friendly benefits payable to its own members,\r\nincluding the allowance to men out of work. The financial autonomy\r\nof the branch is, however, more apparent than real. No penny must be\r\nexpended except in accordance with precise rules. The branch retains\r\nits own funds, but these are the property of the whole society, and\r\nat the end of each year the balances are “equalised” by a complicated\r\nsystem of remittances from branch to branch, ordered by the Central\r\nExecutive in such a way that each branch starts the year with the same\r\namount of capital per member. The cumbrous plan of annual equalisation\r\nis a device adopted in order to maintain the feeling of local\r\nself-government under a strictly centralised financial system.[360]\r\nFrom the decision of the branch any member may appeal to the Central\r\nExecutive Council. The decisions of this Council on all questions of\r\nfriendly benefits are, however, strictly limited to the interpretation\r\nof the existing laws of the society. These rules, which include in\r\nequal detail both the constitutional and the financial code, cannot be\r\naltered or modified except by a specially convened meeting of delegates\r\nfrom every district. Careful provision is, moreover, made against the\r\ndanger of hasty or ill-considered legislation even by this supreme\r\nauthority. No amendment may be so much as considered without having\r\nbeen circulated to all the branches six weeks prior to the delegate\r\nmeeting, and having thereupon been discussed and re-discussed by the\r\nmembers at two successive general meetings convened for the purpose.\r\nThus every delegate comes to his legislative duties charged with a\r\ndirect and even detailed mandate from his constituents. Moreover, it is\r\nexpressly provided that no friendly benefit shall be abrogated unless\r\nthe decision of the delegate meeting to that effect is ratified by a\r\nmajority of two-thirds on a vote of the members of the whole society.\r\nAs a friendly society, therefore, the Association consists of a number\r\nof self-governing branches acting according to the provisions of a\r\ndetailed code, and amenable, in respect of its interpretation, to a\r\nCentral Executive.\r\n\r\nAs a Trade Union, on the contrary, the Association has been from the\r\nfirst a highly centralised body. The great object of the amalgamation\r\nwas to secure uniformity in trade policy, and to promote the\r\nequalisation of what the economists call “real wages”[361] throughout\r\nthe whole country. With this view the Central Executive has always\r\nretained the absolute power of granting or withholding strike pay.\r\nNo individual can receive strike allowance from his branch except\r\nupon an express order of the Executive. Local knowledge, however, is\r\nclearly needed for the decision in matters of trade policy, and on the\r\namalgamation “district” committees were established, consisting of the\r\nrepresentatives of neighbouring branches. These committees have no\r\nconcern with the administration of friendly benefits, which, as we have\r\nseen, is the business of each branch. Their function is to guard the\r\nlocal interests of the trade, to watch for encroachments, and to advise\r\nthe Executive Council in the administration of strike pay. Unlike the\r\nbranches, they possess no independent authority, and are required to\r\nact strictly under the orders of headquarters, to which the minutes of\r\ntheir proceedings are regularly sent for confirmation.\r\n\r\nNot less impressive than this elaborate constitution, with its system\r\nof checks and counter-checks, was the magnitude of the financial\r\ntransactions of the new society. The high contribution of a shilling a\r\nweek, paid with unexampled regularity by a constantly increasing body\r\nof members, provided an income which surpassed the wildest dreams of\r\nprevious Trade Union organisations, and enabled the society to meet any\r\nlocal emergency without serious effort. A large portion of this income\r\nwas absorbed by the expensive friendly benefits, which were on a scale\r\nat that time unfamiliar to the societies in other trades. And when it\r\nwas found that the contribution of a shilling a week not only met all\r\nthese requirements, but also provided an accumulating balance, which\r\ncould be drawn upon for strike pay, the indignation of the employers\r\nknew no bounds. For many years the union of friendly benefits with\r\ntrade protection funds, now considered as the guarantee of a peaceful\r\nTrade Union policy, was denounced as a dishonest attempt to subsidise\r\nstrikes at the expense of the innocent subscriber to a friendly society\r\ninsurance against sickness, accident, and old age.[362]\r\n\r\nIn scarcely less marked contrast with the current tradition of Trade\r\nUnionism was the publicity which the Amalgamated Engineers from the\r\nfirst courted. Powerful societies, such as the existing Union of\r\nStonemasons, had between 1834 and 1850 elaborated a constitution which\r\nproved as durable as that of the Amalgamated Engineers, though of a\r\nslightly different type. But the old feeling of secretiveness still\r\ndominated both the leaders and the rank and file. The _Stonemasons’\r\nFortnightly Circular_, which, regularly appearing as it has done since\r\n1834, constitutes perhaps the most valuable single record of the Trade\r\nUnion Movement, was never seen outside the branch meeting-place.[363]\r\nAt the Royal Commission of 1867-8 the employers’ witnesses bitterly\r\ncomplained of their inability to get copies of this publication and of\r\na similar periodical circular of the Bricklayers’ Society.[364] As late\r\nas 1871 we find the liability to publicity adduced by some Unions as an\r\nargument against seeking recognition by the law.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the Engineers believed, on the contrary, in the power of\r\nadvertisement. We have already noticed the two short-lived newspapers\r\nwhich Newton and Allan published in 1850 and 1851-2, for the express\r\npurpose of making known the society and its objects. For many years\r\nafter the amalgamation it was a regular practice to forward to the\r\npress, for publication or review, all the monthly, quarterly, and\r\nannual reports, as well as the more important of the circulars issued\r\nto the members. Representatives were sent to the Conference on Capital\r\nand Labour held by the Society of Arts in 1854, and to the congresses\r\nof the Social Science Association from 1859 onward. Newton and Allan\r\nappear, indeed, to have eagerly seized every opportunity of writing\r\nletters to the newspapers, reading papers, and delivering lectures\r\nabout the organisation which they had established.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand the great influence which, during the next\r\ntwenty years, this “New Model” exercised upon the Trade Union world.\r\nIts most important imitator was the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters,\r\nwhich, as we shall see, arose out of the great London strike of\r\n1859-60. The tailors in 1866 drew together into an amalgamated society,\r\nwhich adopted, almost without alteration, the whole code of the\r\nengineers, and in 1869 the London Society of Compositors appointed a\r\nspecial committee to report upon “the constitution and working of the\r\nAmalgamated Trades,” with a view to their imitation in the printing\r\nindustry--an intention which, in spite of the favourable character of\r\nthe report, was not carried out.[365] Scarcely a trade exists which\r\ndid not, between 1852 and 1875, either attempt to imitate the whole\r\nconstitution of the Amalgamated Engineers, or incorporate one or other\r\nof its characteristic features.\r\n\r\nThe five or six years following the collapse of the great lock-out of\r\n1852, though constituting a period of quiet progress in particular\r\nsocieties, are for the historian of the general Trade Union Movement,\r\nalmost a blank. The severe commercial depression of 1846-49 was\r\nsucceeded by seven years of steadily expanding trade, which furnished\r\nno occasion for general reduction of wages. The reaction against the\r\nambitious projects of the Trade Union of 1834 continued to discourage\r\neven federal action;[366] whilst the complete failure of the struggle\r\nof the engineers, followed as it was in 1853 by the disastrous strike\r\nof the Preston cotton-spinners for a ten per cent advance, by an\r\nequally unsuccessful struggle of the Kidderminster carpet-weavers,\r\nand by a fierce and futile conflict by the Dowlais ironworkers,[367]\r\nincreased the disinclination of the Unions to aggressive trade action\r\non a large scale. The disrepute into which strikes had fallen was\r\nintensified by the spread among the more thoughtful working men of\r\nthe principles of Industrial Co-operation. This new development of\r\nOwen’s teaching took two forms, both, it need hardly be said, differing\r\nfundamentally from the Owenism of 1834. In Lancashire the success of\r\nthe “Rochdale Pioneers,” established in 1844, had led to the rapid\r\nextension of the Co-operative Store, the association of consumers for\r\nthe supply of their own wants. To some extent the stalwart leaders\r\nof the Lancashire and Yorkshire working men were diverted from the\r\norganisation of trade combinations to the establishment of co-operative\r\nshops and corn-mills. Meanwhile the “Christian Socialists” of London\r\nhad caught up the idea of Buchez and the Parisian projects of 1848,\r\nand were advocating with an almost apostolic fervour the formation\r\nof associations of producers, in which groups of working men were to\r\nbecome their own employers.[368]\r\n\r\nThe generous enthusiasm with which the “Christian Socialists”\r\nhad thrown themselves into the Engineers’ struggle, and their\r\nobvious devotion to the interests of Labour, gave their schemes\r\nof “Self-governing Workshops” a great vogue. Numberless small\r\nundertakings were started by operative engineers, cabinetmakers,\r\ntailors, bootmakers, and hatters in the Metropolis and in other large\r\nindustrial centres, and for a few years the Executives and Committees\r\nof the various Unions vied with each other in recommending co-operative\r\nproduction to their members. But it soon became apparent that this new\r\nform of co-operation was intended, not as an adjunct or a development\r\nof the Trade Union, but as an alternative form of industrial\r\norganisation. For, unlike the Owenites of 1834, the Christian\r\nSocialists had no conception of the substitution of profit-making\r\nenterprise by the whole body of wage-earners, organised either in a\r\nself-contained community or in a complete Trades Union. They sought\r\nonly to replace the individual capitalist by self-governing bodies of\r\nprofit-making workmen. A certain number of the ardent spirits among the\r\nLondon and north country workmen became the managers and secretaries\r\nof these undertakings, and ceased to be energetic members of their\r\nrespective Unions. “We have found,” say the Engineers’ Executive in\r\ntheir annual report of 1855, “that when a few of our own members have\r\ncommenced business hitherto they have abandoned the society, and\r\nconducted the workshops even worse than other employers.” Fortunately\r\nfor the Trade Union Movement the uniform commercial failure of these\r\nexperiments, so long, at any rate, as they retained their original\r\nform of the self-governing workshop, soon became obvious to those\r\nconcerned. The idea of “Co-operative Production” constantly reappears\r\nin contemporary Trade Union records, but after the failure of the\r\nco-operative establishments of 1848-52 it ceases, for nearly twenty\r\nyears, to be a question of “practical politics” in the Trade Union\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIn spite of this intellectual diversion the work of Trade Union\r\nconsolidation was being steadily carried on. The Amalgamated Engineers\r\ndoubled their numbers in the ten years that followed their strike,\r\nand by 1861 their Union had accumulated the unprecedented balance\r\nof £73,398. The National Societies of Ironfounders and Stonemasons\r\ngrew in a similar proportion. A revival of Trade Unionism took place\r\namong the textile operatives. The present association of Lancashire\r\ncotton-spinners began its career in 1853, whilst the cotton-weavers\r\nsecured in the same year what has been fitly termed their Magna Charta,\r\nthe “Blackburn List” of piecework rates. But with the exception of\r\nthe building trades, Trade Unionism assumed, during these years,\r\na peaceful attitude. The leaders no longer declaimed against “the\r\nidle classes,” but sought to justify the Trade Union position with\r\narguments based on middle-class economics. The contributions of the\r\nAmalgamated Engineers are described “as a general voluntary rate in\r\naid of the Poor’s Rate.”[369] The Executive Council cannot doubt\r\nthat employers will not “regard a society like ours with disfavour.\r\nThey will begin to understand that it is not intended, nor adapted,\r\nto damage their interests, but rather to advance them, by elevating\r\nthe character of their workmen, and proportionately lessening their\r\nown responsibilities.” The project of substituting “Councils of\r\nConciliation” for strikes and lock-outs grew in favour with Trade\r\nUnion leaders. Hundreds of petitions in favour of their establishment\r\nwere got up by the National Association of United Trades, then on its\r\nlast legs. The House of Commons Committees in 1856 and 1860 found the\r\noperatives in all trades disposed to support the principle of voluntary\r\nsubmission to arbitration. For a brief period it seemed as if peace was\r\nhenceforth to prevail over the industrial world.\r\n\r\nThe era of strikes which set in with the contraction of trade in 1857\r\nproved how fallacious had been these hopes. The building trades, in\r\nparticular, had remained less affected than the Engineers or the\r\nCotton Operatives by the change of tone. The local branches of the\r\nStonemasons, Bricklayers, and other building trade operatives, often\r\nagainst the wish of their Central Committees, were engaged between\r\n1853 and 1859 in an almost constant succession of little strikes\r\nagainst separate firms, in which the men were generally successful in\r\ngaining advances of wages.[370] These years were, moreover, notable\r\nfor the recognition in the provincial building trades of “working\r\nrules,” or signed agreements between employers and workmen (usually\r\nbetween the local Masters’ Associations and the Trade Unions),\r\nspecifying in minute detail the conditions of the collective bargain.\r\nWithout doubt the adoption of these rules was a step forward in the\r\ndirection of industrial peace; but, like international treaties, they\r\nwere frequently preceded by desperate conflicts in which both sides\r\nexhausted their resources, and learnt to respect the strength of the\r\nother party. With the depression of trade more important disputes\r\noccurred. During 1858 fierce conflicts arose between masters and men\r\nin the flint glass industry and in the West Yorkshire coalfield.\r\nThe introduction of the sewing-machine into the boot and shoemaking\r\nvillages of Northamptonshire led to a series of angry struggles. But\r\nof the great disputes of 1858 to 1861, the builders’ strike in the\r\nMetropolis in 1859-60 was by far the most important in its effect upon\r\nthe Trade Union Movement.\r\n\r\nThe dispute of 1859 originated in the growing movement for a shortening\r\nof the hours of labour.[371] The demand for a Nine Hours Day in the\r\nBuilding Trades was first made by the Liverpool Stonemasons in 1846,\r\nand renewed by the London Stonemasons in 1853. In neither case,\r\nhowever, was the claim persisted in. Four years later the movement was\r\nrevived by the London Carpenters, whose memorial to their employers was\r\nmet, after a joint conference, by a decisive refusal. Meanwhile the\r\nStonemasons were seeking to obtain the Saturday half-holiday, which\r\nthe employers equally refused. This led, in the autumn of 1858, to the\r\nformation of a Joint Committee of Carpenters, Masons, and Bricklayers,\r\nwhich, on November 18, 1858, addressed a dignified memorial to the\r\nmaster builders, urging that the hours of labour should be shortened\r\nby one per day, and that future building contracts should be accepted\r\non this basis. At first ignored by the employers, this request was\r\neventually refused as decidedly as it had been in 1853 and 1857. The\r\nJoint Committee thereupon made a renewed attempt by petitioning four\r\nfirms selected by ballot. Among these was that of Messrs. Trollope,\r\nwho promptly dismissed one of the men who had presented the memorial.\r\nThis action led to an immediate strike against Messrs. Trollope.\r\nWithin a fortnight every master builder in London employing over fifty\r\nmen had closed his establishment, and twenty-four thousand men were\r\nperemptorily deprived of their employment. The controversy which raged\r\nin the columns of contemporary newspapers during this pitched battle\r\nbetween Capital and Labour brought out in strong relief the state of\r\nmind of the Metropolitan employers. Uninfluenced by the progress of\r\npublic opinion, or by the new tone of respect and moderation adopted by\r\nTrade Union leaders, the London employers took up the position of their\r\npredecessors of 1834. They absolutely refused to recognise the claim of\r\nthe representatives of the men even to discuss with them the conditions\r\nof employment. This attitude was combined with a determined attempt to\r\ndestroy all combination, the instrument adopted being the well-worn\r\nDocument. The Central Association of Master Builders resolved, in terms\r\nalmost identical with its predecessor of 1834, that “no member of this\r\nAssociation shall engage or continue in his employment any contributor\r\nto the funds of any Trades Union or Trades Society which practises\r\ninterference with the regulation of any establishment, the hours or\r\nterms of labour, the contracts or agreements of employers or employed,\r\nor the qualification or terms of service.”\r\n\r\nThis declaration of war on Trade Unionism gained for the men on strike\r\nthe support of the whole Trade Union world. The Central Committee\r\nof the great society of Stonemasons, which had hitherto discouraged\r\nthe Metropolitan Nine Hours Movement as premature, took up the\r\nstruggle against the Document as one of vital importance. Meetings of\r\ndelegates from the organised Metropolitan trades were held in order\r\nto rally the forces of Trade Unionism to the cause of the builders.\r\nThe subscriptions which poured in from all parts of the kingdom\r\ndemonstrated the possession, in the hands of trade societies, of heavy\r\nand hitherto unsuspected reserves of financial strength. The London\r\nPianoforte Makers contributed £300. The Flint Glass Makers, who had\r\njust emerged from a prolonged struggle on their own account, sent a\r\nsimilar sum. “Trades Committees” were formed in all the industrial\r\ncentres, and remitted large amounts. Glasgow and Manchester sent over\r\n£800 each, and Liverpool over £500. The newly formed Yorkshire Miners’\r\nAssociation forwarded £230. The Boilermakers, Coopers, and Coachmakers’\r\nSocieties were especially liberal in their gifts. But the sensation of\r\nthe subscription list was the grant by the Amalgamated Engineers of\r\nthree successive weekly donations of £1000 each--an event long recalled\r\nwith emotion by the survivors of the struggle. Altogether some £23,000\r\nwere subscribed (exclusive of the payments by the societies directly\r\nconcerned), an amount far in excess of any previous strike subsidy.\r\n\r\nSuch abundant support enabled the men to defeat the employers’ aims,\r\nthough not to secure their own demands. The Central Association of\r\nMaster Builders clung desperately to the Document, but failed to\r\nobtain an adequate number of men willing to subscribe to its terms.\r\nIn December 1859 a suggestion was made by Lord St. Leonards that\r\nthe Document be withdrawn, a lengthy statement of the law relating\r\nto trade combinations being hung up in all the establishments as a\r\nsubstitute. The employers’ obstinacy held out for two months longer,\r\nbut finally succumbed in February 1860, when the Platonic suggestion of\r\nLord St. Leonards was adopted, and the embittered dispute was brought\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nThis drawn battle between the forces of Capital and Labour ranks as a\r\nleading event in Trade Union history, not only because it revived the\r\nfeeling of solidarity between different trades, but also on account\r\nof the importance of two consolidating organisations to which it gave\r\nbirth. Out of the Building Trades Strike of 1859-60 arose the London\r\nTrades Council (to be described in the following chapter) and the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Carpenters, the most notable adoption by another\r\ntrade of the “New Model” introduced by Newton and Allan.\r\n\r\nThe strike had revealed to the London carpenters the complete state of\r\ndisorganisation into which their industry had fallen. It was they, it\r\nis true, who had initiated the Nine Hours Movement in the Metropolis,\r\nbut the committee which memorialised the employers had represented no\r\nbody of organised workmen. George Potter, who was the leader of this\r\nmovement, could draw around him only a group of delegates elected\r\nby the men in each shop. There were, indeed, not more than about a\r\nthousand carpenters in London who were members of any trade society\r\nwhatsoever, and these were scattered among numerous tiny benefit clubs.\r\nThe Friendly Society of Operative Carpenters, which, as we have seen,\r\nwas a militant branch of the Builders’ Union of 1830-34, had, like the\r\nStonemasons’ Society, maintained a continuous existence. Unlike that\r\nsociety, however, it had kept the old character of a loose federation\r\nfor trade purposes only, depending for its finances upon occasional\r\nlevies. Perhaps for this reason it had lost its exclusive hold upon\r\nthe provinces, and had gained no footing in London. As a competent\r\nobserver remarks: “At the time of the 1859-60 strikes the masons alone\r\nof the building trades were organised into a single society extending\r\nthroughout England, and providing not only for trade purposes, but for\r\nthe ordinary benefits.... The London masons locked out were supported\r\nregularly and punctually by their society, and could have continued the\r\nstruggle for an indefinite time; but the other trades, split up into\r\nnumerous local societies, were soon reduced to extremities.”[372] The\r\nCarpenters’ Committee saw with envy the capacity of the Stonemasons’\r\nSociety to provide long-continued strike pay for its members, and\r\nwere profoundly impressed by the successive donations of £1000 each\r\nmade by the Amalgamated Engineers. Directly the strike was over, the\r\nleading members of the little benefit clubs met together to discuss\r\nthe formation of a national organisation on the Engineers’ model.\r\nWilliam Allan lent them every assistance in adapting the rules of his\r\nown society to the carpenters’ trade, and watched over the preliminary\r\nproceedings. The new society started on June 4, 1860, with a few\r\nhundred members. For the first two years its progress was slow; but in\r\nOctober 1862 it had the good fortune to elect as its general secretary\r\na man whose ability and cautious sagacity promptly raised it to a\r\nposition of influence in the Trade Union world. Robert Applegarth,\r\nsecretary of a local Carpenters’ Union at Sheffield, had been quick to\r\nperceive the advantages of amalgamation, and had brought his society\r\nover with him. Under his administration the new Union advanced by leaps\r\nand bounds, and in a few years it stood, in magnitude of financial\r\ntransactions and accumulated funds, second only to the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Engineers itself. Moreover, Applegarth’s capacity brought\r\nhim at once into that little circle of Trade Union leaders whose\r\nactivity forms during the next ten years the central point of Trade\r\nUnion history.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[308] Between 1850 and 1874 there was (except, perhaps, during the\r\nAmerican Civil War) no falling off in the value of our export trade\r\ncomparable to the serious declines of 1826, 1829, 1837, 1842, and\r\n1848. We do not pretend to account for this difference, but may remind\r\nthe reader of the coincident increase in the production of gold, the\r\ninfluence of Free Trade and railways, and, as the bimetallists would\r\ntell us, the currency arrangements which were brought to an end in 1873.\r\n\r\n[309] This was an elaborate national organisation with 60 branches,\r\ngrouped under five District Boards. But it enrolled only 4320 members,\r\nand broke up in 1847, after numerous local strikes. In June 1849 most\r\nof the provincial branches joined in the Typographical Association,\r\nfrom which for some time the strong Manchester and Birmingham societies\r\nstood aloof; whilst the London men formed the London Society of\r\nCompositors.\r\n\r\n[310] _The Colliers’ Guide, showing the Necessity of the Colliers\r\nUniting to Protect their Labour from the Iron Hand of Oppression_,\r\netc., by J.

Thomas\r\nRoberts, of Chelmsford, was born in 1806, and became a solicitor at\r\nManchester. He was an enthusiastic Chartist, and friend of Fergus\r\nO’Connor, to whose Land Bank he acted as legal adviser. From 1843\r\nonwards his name appears in nearly all the legal business of the\r\nTrade Unions. The collapse of 1848 somewhat damaged his reputation,\r\nbut he continued to be frequently retained for many years. In 1867\r\nhe organised the defence of Allen, Larking, and O’Brien, the Irish\r\n“Manchester Martyrs,” who were hanged for the rescue of Fenian\r\nprisoners and the murder of a policeman. In later years Roberts retired\r\nto a country house in the neighbourhood of “O’Connorville,” near\r\nRickmansworth, the scene of one of O’Connor’s colonies, where he died\r\non September 7, 1871. A pamphlet on the Trade Union Bill of 1871 is the\r\nonly publication of his that we have discovered, but he appears also to\r\nhave edited a report of the engineers’ trial in 1847, and reports of\r\nsome other legal proceedings.\r\n\r\n[313] _Flint Glass Makers’ Magazine_, October 1851. The years 1847-8\r\nhad witnessed many strikingly vindictive prosecutions of Trade\r\nUnionists. Besides the case of the engineers, to which we shall refer\r\nhereafter, twenty-one stonemasons of London were indicted in 1848 for\r\nconspiracy, but, after repeated postponements, the prosecuting employer\r\nfailed to proceed with the case. The Sheffield razor-grinders stood\r\nin greater jeopardy. John Drury, and three other members of their\r\nsociety, were tried and sentenced to ten years’ transportation at the\r\ninstance of the Sheffield Manufacturers’ Protection Association on the\r\nrandom accusations of two dissolute convicts that they had incited them\r\nto destroy machinery. This monstrous perversion of justice aroused\r\nthe greatest indignation. Public meetings were held by the National\r\nAssociation of United Trades. The indictment was quashed on a technical\r\npoint, but a new one was immediately preferred against the defendants.\r\nThe local feeling was, however, so great that they were finally, after\r\na year’s suspense, released on their own recognisances (July 12, 1849).\r\nA Sheffield Trade Unionist declared that “the tyranny of the employers\r\nhad been so great,” in perverting the local administration of the\r\nlaw, “that the men laid their grievances before the Government. Sir\r\nGeorge Grey ordered an inquiry.... Twenty cases of parties who had been\r\nconvicted by the magistrates were brought before a Board of Inquiry,\r\nseventeen of which were quashed” (_Stonemasons’ Fortnightly Circular_,\r\nNovember 23, 1848).\r\n\r\n[314] Bill No. 58 of 1844, introduced by William Miles, M.P.

An accomplished man of the world, with the habits of a dandy,\r\nhe nevertheless devoted himself with remarkable assiduity not only to\r\nthe Parliamentary business of the Chartists and Trade Unionists, but\r\nalso to the dry details of the committee work of the association of\r\nwhich he became president. The _Life and Correspondence_ of Duncombe,\r\nwhich his son published in 1868, describes him almost exclusively as\r\na fashionable man of the world and House of Commons politician, and\r\nentirely ignores his more solid work for Trade Unionism during the\r\nyears 1845-8.\r\n\r\n[320] In this document we may perhaps trace the hand of T. J. Dunning,\r\none of the ablest Trade Unionists of his time. Born in 1799, he became\r\nSecretary of the Consolidated Society of Bookbinders in 1843. In 1845\r\nhe joined the National Association of United Trades, but left that\r\nbody after a few years. The _Bookbinders’ Circular_, which he started\r\nin 1850, was, during the rest of his life, largely written by himself,\r\nand contains many well-reasoned articles on Trade Union matters. In\r\n1858 Dunning joined the celebrated Committee of Inquiry into Trade\r\nSocieties which was appointed by the Social Science Association. He\r\ncontributed a history of his own society to the Report, and frequently\r\ntook part in the subsequent annual congresses. His chief literary\r\nproduction is the essay entitled, _Trades Unions and Strikes; their\r\nphilosophy and intention_ (1860, 50 pp.), which he wrote for the prize\r\ninstituted by his own Union for the best defence of the workmen’s\r\norganisation. This essay, which no publisher would accept, and which\r\nwas printed by his society, remains, perhaps--apart from George\r\nHowell’s historical researches in _Conflicts of Capital and Labour_,\r\nand _Labour Legislation, Labour Movements and Labour Leaders_--the\r\nbest presentation of the Trade Union case which any manual worker has\r\nproduced. He died in harness on the 23rd of December 1873.\r\n\r\n[321] Report of London Committee of Trades Delegates to the National\r\nConference of Trades Delegates, Easter, 1845; preserved in the archives\r\nof the Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons.\r\n\r\n[322] _Stonemasons’ Fortnightly Circular_, May 14, 1846.\r\n\r\n[323] Minutes of delegate meetings of the “Operative Cotton-spinners,\r\nSelf-acting Minders, Twiners, and Rovers,” held every other Sunday.

By the influence of the National Association,\r\nsuch a list was agreed to during 1849 by all the employers except\r\ntwo. One of these treated the men with exceptional duplicity. Having,\r\nas he thought, adequately prepared himself; he threw off the mask\r\nin July 1850, and flatly refused to continue the negotiations. The\r\nfierce industrial and legal conflict which ensued attracted general\r\nattention. Many of the strikers were imprisoned for breach of contract;\r\nand the struggle culminated in the prosecution of three members of\r\nthe committee of the National Association, together with several of\r\nthe local Unionists, for conspiracy to molest and intimidate the\r\nemployer by inducing men to leave his employment. Owing to legal\r\nquibbles, raised first on behalf of the Crown, and then on behalf of\r\nthe defendants, the case was tried no fewer than three times, the\r\nfinal judgment not being delivered until November 1851, when five of\r\nthe prisoners were sentenced to three months’, and one to one month’s\r\nimprisonment.

In 1856 its\r\nsecretary, Thomas Winters, gave evidence in favour of conciliation\r\nbefore the Select Committee on Masters and Operatives (Equitable\r\nCouncils, etc.). He stated that the membership then numbered between\r\n5,000 and 6,000, and that the central committee consisted of three\r\nsalaried members, who gave up their whole time to the work. A\r\nsubsequent secretary (E. Humphries) appeared before a similar committee\r\nfour years later, his evidence showing that the association, though\r\nit was still in existence, had taken no part in any of the important\r\nlabour struggles of the past seven or eight years. Mr. George Howell\r\nincidentally puts the date of its dissolution at 1860 or 1861 (see\r\nhis article “Trades Union Congresses and Social legislation” in\r\n_Contemporary Review_ for September 1889).\r\n\r\n[327] _English Stonemasons’ Fortnightly Circular_, December 25, 1845.\r\n\r\n[328] The _Potters’ Examiner_, started December 1843, was converted,\r\nin July 1848, into the _Potters’ Examiner and Emigrants’ Advocate_,\r\npublished at Liverpool and concerned chiefly with emigration.

For thirty years the accounts of\r\nthe larger societies include, off and on, considerable appropriations\r\nfor the emigration of members. The tabular statement of expenditure\r\npublished in the Ironmoulders’ Annual Report shows, for instance, that\r\n£4,712 was spent in this way between 1855 and 1874. In the Amalgamated\r\nCarpenters an Emigration Benefit lingered until 1886, when it was\r\nfinally abolished by the General Council; the members resident in the\r\nUnited States and Colonies strongly objecting to this use of the funds.\r\nBut it was between 1850 and 1860 that emigration found most favour as\r\nan integral part of Trade Union policy. The Trade Unions of the United\r\nStates and the Australian Colonies addressed vigorous protests to the\r\nofficials of the English societies (see, for example, the _Stonemasons’\r\nFortnightly Circular_, June 1856), a fact which co-operated with the\r\ndying away of the “gold rush,” and the change of Trade Union opinion,\r\nto cause the abandonment of the policy, until it was revived in 1872\r\nfor a decade or so, by the Agricultural Labourers’ Unions.\r\n\r\n[342] _Flint Glass Makers’ Magazine_, September 1857.\r\n\r\n[343] During these years the Executive Committees of the larger\r\nsocieties were waging war on the “liquor allowance.” In the reports and\r\nfinancial statements of the Unions for the first half of the century,\r\ndrink was one of the largest items of expenditure, express provision\r\nbeing made by the rules for the refreshment of the officers and members\r\nat all meetings. The rules of the London Society of Woolstaplers (1813)\r\nstate that “the President shall be accommodated with his own choice\r\nof liquors, wine only excepted.” The Friendly Society of Ironmoulders\r\n(1809) ordains that the Marshal shall distribute the beer round the\r\nmeeting impartially, members being forbidden to drink out of turn\r\n“except the officers at the table or a member on his first coming to\r\nthe town.” Even as late as 1837 the rules of the Steam-Engine Makers’\r\nSociety direct one-third of the weekly contribution to be spent in\r\nthe refreshment of the members, a provision which drops out in the\r\nrevision of 1846. In that year the Delegate Meeting of the Ironmoulders\r\nprohibited drinking and smoking at its own sittings, and followed up\r\nthis self-denying ordinance by altering the rules of the society so as\r\nto change the allowance of beer at branch meetings to its equivalent in\r\nmoney. “We believe,” they remark in their address to the members, “the\r\nbusiness of the society would be much better done were there no liquor\r\nallowance. Interruption, confusion, and scenes of violence and disorder\r\nare often the characteristic of meetings where order, calmness, and\r\nimpartiality should prevail.” By 1860 most of the larger societies\r\nhad abolished all allowance for liquor, and some had even prohibited\r\nits consumption during business meetings. It is to be remembered that\r\nthe Unions had, at first, no other meeting place than the club-room\r\nfreely placed at their disposal by the publican, and that their\r\npayment for drink was of the nature of rent. Meanwhile the Compositors\r\nand Bookbinders were removing their headquarters from public-houses\r\nto offices of their own, and the Steam-Engine Makers were allowing\r\nbranches to hire rooms for meetings so as to avoid temptation. In 1850\r\nthe Ironmoulders report that some publicans were refusing to lend rooms\r\nfor meetings, owing to the growth of Temperance.\r\n\r\n[344] It was the strength of their organisation in London in 1799,\r\nas we have seen, that led to the employers’ petition to the House of\r\nCommons, out of which sprang the Combination Acts of 1799 and 1800. See\r\nalso the evidence given by Galloway and other employers before the 1824\r\nSelect Committee on Artisans and Machinery; also incidental references\r\nin the _Life of Sir William Fairbairn_, 1877, and other works. We\r\nhave been unable to discover any documents of engineering societies\r\nprior to 1822. Sir William Fairbairn, in the preface to his _Mills and\r\nMill-work_, 1861, attributes the supersession of the millwright to the\r\nchanges consequent on the introduction of the steam-engine.\r\n\r\n[345] William Newton was born at Congleton in 1822, his father, who had\r\nonce occupied a superior position, being then a journeyman machinist.\r\nThe boy went to work in engine shops at the age of fourteen, joined the\r\nHanley Branch of the Journeymen Steam-Engine Makers’ Society in 1842,\r\nsoon afterwards moving to London (where he worked in the same shop\r\nas Henry James, afterwards Lord James of Hereford, then an engineer\r\npupil, and later noted for his knowledge of Trade Unionism), and rose\r\nto be foreman. After his dismissal in 1848 for his Trade Union activity\r\nhe took a public-house at Ratcliffe, and devoted himself largely to\r\nthe promotion of the amalgamation of the engineering societies. In\r\n1852 he became, for a short period, secretary to a small insurance\r\ncompany. At the General Election of 1852 he became a candidate for the\r\nTower Hamlets. He was opposed by both the great political parties,\r\nbut the show of hands at the hustings was in his favour. At the poll\r\nhe was unsuccessful, receiving, however, 1,095 votes. In 1860 he was\r\npresented with a testimonial (including a sum of £300) from his A.S.E.\r\nfellow-members. In later years he became the proprietor of a prosperous\r\nlocal newspaper and was elected by the Stepney Vestry as its chairman\r\nand also as its representative on the Metropolitan Board of Works. He\r\nbecame one of the leading members of that body, on which he served\r\nfrom 1862 to 1876, filling the important office of deputy chairman to\r\nthe Parliamentary, Fire Brigade, and other influential committees. In\r\n1868 he again contested the Tower Hamlets against both Liberals and\r\nConservatives, receiving 2,890 votes; and in 1875 he unsuccessfully\r\nfought a bye-election at Ipswich. He died March 9, 1876, when his\r\nfuneral, in which the Metropolitan Board of Works took part, assumed a\r\npublic character.\r\n\r\n[346] This journal is preserved in the Manchester Public Library (341,\r\nP. 37).

An\r\nadmirable account of this society, founded on documents no longer\r\nextant, is given in an article by Professor Brentano in the _North\r\nBritish Review_, October 1870, entitled “The Growth of a Trades Union,”\r\nFor some other particulars see the _Jubilee Souvenir History of the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Engineers_, 1901.\r\n\r\n[348] Executive Circular, 1846, cited in proceedings in _R._ v.\r\n_Selsby_. Two full accounts of the trial were published, viz. a\r\n_Verbatim Report of the Trial for Conspiracy in R._ v. _Selsby and\r\nothers_ (Liverpool, 1847, 66 pp.), published under the “authority of\r\nthe Executive of the Steam-Engine Makers’ Society,” and a _Narrative,\r\netc., of the Trial, R._ v. _Selsby_ (London, 1847, 68 pp.). Both\r\nare preserved in the Manchester Public Library, P. 2198. The legal\r\nreport is in Cox’s _Crown Cases_, vol. v. p. 496, etc. Contemporary\r\nTrade Union reports contain many references to the proceedings. It\r\nwas noticed as an instance of the animus of the prosecution that the\r\nindictment contained 4914 counts, and measured fifty-seven yards in\r\nlength. W. P. Roberts organised the defence, which cost the Union\r\n£1800. The firm in whose works the dispute arose became bankrupt within\r\na few years. See the _Jubilee Souvenir History of the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Engineers_, 1901.\r\n\r\n[349] _The Trades Advocate and Herald of Progress_ was an 8 pp. quarto\r\nweekly, price 1d., No. 1 being dated June 1850. The volume from June\r\nto December 1850 is preserved in the Manchester Public Library (401\r\nE, 18). An able article by John Burnett in the _Newcastle Weekly\r\nChronicle_, July 3, 1875, gives a vivid picture of the struggle for\r\namalgamation.\r\n\r\n[350] This was pointed out in Professor Brentano’s article in the\r\n_North British Review_, already quoted.\r\n\r\n[351] The organ of the Executive Council was the _Operative_, a\r\nwell-written weekly journal, which was set on foot by Newton in January\r\n1851. The price was at first 1½d., and afterwards 1d. per number. The\r\nissues from the beginning down to July 1852, probably all that were\r\npublished, are preserved in the British Museum (P. P. 1424, a.m.).\r\nNewton acted as editor, and contributed nearly all the articles\r\nrelating to the engineers and Trade Unions generally.\r\n\r\n[352] The largest and most powerful of the other Unions in 1851 were\r\nthose of the Ironfounders and the Stonemasons, which numbered between\r\nfour and five thousand members each. It must be remembered that the\r\nprevious ephemeral associations of the cotton-spinners and miners,\r\nwhich often for a time counted their tens of thousands of members, were\r\nexclusively strike organisations, with contributions of 1d. or 2d. per\r\nweek only. The huge associations of 1830-34 had usually no regular\r\nsubscription at all, and depended on irregularly paid levies. A trade\r\nsociety which, like the Amalgamated Engineers, could count on a regular\r\nincome of £500 a week was without precedent.\r\n\r\n[353] See the resolutions of the Birmingham Delegate Meeting of the\r\nIron Trades, September 28, 1850, in the _Trades Union Advocate_,\r\nNovember 1850.\r\n\r\n[354] It was resolved: “That we are prepared to assist the workmen at\r\nMessrs. Platt to the utmost of our power, but cannot consent to the men\r\nleaving their situations, because they may not at present be able to\r\nobtain the working of the machines.” The best account of the struggle\r\nis to be found in the _Jubilee Souvenir History of the A.S.E._ (1901),\r\npp. 34-41.\r\n\r\n[355] Lord Goderich, afterwards the Marquis of Ripon, gave the\r\nExecutive a cheque for £500 to enable the strike pay to be kept up on\r\na temporary emergency; one of many generous efforts, during a long\r\nlifetime, to assist the wage-earning class.\r\n\r\n[356] Executive Circular of April 26, 1852, in _Operative_, May 1,\r\n1852. A number of the men refused to sign, and many emigrated. E.\r\nVansittart Neale advanced £1030 to members for this purpose, the whole\r\nof which was repaid by the borrowers.\r\n\r\n[357] Among the abundant literature on this great struggle may be\r\nmentioned the _Account_, by Thomas (afterwards Judge) Hughes, in the\r\n_Report on Trade Societies_, by the Social Science Association, 1860;\r\nJ. M. Ludlow’s lectures, entitled _The Master Engineers and their\r\nWorkmen_, 1852; a pamphlet, _May I not do what I will with my own?_ by\r\nE. Vansittart Neale; _Jubilee Souvenir History of the A.S.E._, 1901;\r\nand the evidence given by William Newton (for the men) and Sidney\r\nSmith (for the employers) before the Select Committee on Masters\r\nand Operatives (Equitable Councils, etc.) in 1856. The employers’\r\nmanifestoes will be found in the _Times_ from December 1851 to April\r\n1852; the men’s documents and reports of their meetings in the\r\n_Operative_ (edited by Newton), and in the _Northern Star_, then at its\r\nlast gasp.\r\n\r\n[358] It ended the struggle with £700 in hand. Its membership at the\r\nend of 1852 had fallen from 11,829 to 9737, but even then it had a\r\nbalance in hand of £5382, and within three years the members had\r\nincreased to 12,553, and the accumulated funds to the unprecedented\r\ntotal of £35,695. And unlike all previous trade societies, its record\r\nfrom 1852 down to the present time has been one of continued growth\r\nand prosperity, the membership at the end of 1919 being 320,000, with\r\naccumulated funds not far short of three million pounds, being greater\r\nin aggregate amount than the possessions of any other Trade Union\r\norganisation of this or any other country.\r\n\r\n[359] Preface to Rules of the Journeymen Steam-Engine, Machine Makers,\r\nand Millwrights’ Friendly Society, edition of 1845.\r\n\r\n[360] This plan of “equalisation” is, so far as we know, peculiar to\r\nTrade Unions, though we understand from Dr. Baernreither’s _English\r\nAssociations of Working Men_, pp. 283-84, that a few branches of some\r\nof the Friendly Societies adopted a somewhat similar system. Its origin\r\nis unknown to us, but the device is traditionally ascribed to the\r\nJourneymen Steam-Engine and Machine Makers and Millwrights’ Society,\r\nestablished in 1826. It was also in early use by the Steam-Engine\r\nMakers’ Society, established in 1824. Until the Trade Union Act of 1871\r\nit had a positive use. Depending, as Trade Unions were obliged to do,\r\nupon the integrity of their officers, there were great advantages in\r\nthe wide distribution of the funds and the local responsibility of each\r\nbranch for the safe keeping of its share.\r\n\r\n[361] That is to say, local differences in the cost of living have\r\nalways been taken into account.\r\n\r\n[362] Such protests were frequent in the evidence before the Royal\r\nCommission of 1867-68, and form the staple of the innumerable\r\ncriticisms on Trade Unionism between 1852 and 1879. A good vindication\r\nof the Trade Union position is contained in Professor Beesly’s article\r\nin the _Fortnightly Review_, 1867, which was republished as a pamphlet,\r\n_The Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners_, 1867, 20 pp.\r\n\r\n[363] The unique collection of these circulars, containing not only\r\nstatistical and other information of the society, but also frequent\r\nreferences to the building trades and the general movement, was\r\ngenerously placed at our disposal for the purpose of this work, and we\r\nhave found it of the utmost value.\r\n\r\n[364] See, for instance, the evidence of Mault, Questions 3980 in\r\nSecond Report and 4086 in Third Report.\r\n\r\n[365] Report of Special Committee, 1869.\r\n\r\n[366] The National Association of United Trades continued, as we have\r\nalready seen, in nominal existence until 1860 or 1861, but after 1852\r\nit sank to a membership of a few thousands, and played practically no\r\npart in the Trade Union world.\r\n\r\n[367] _Times_, June to December 1853.\r\n\r\n[368] A more detailed account of these developments will be found\r\nin _The Co-operative Movement in Great Britain_ (1891; second\r\nedition, 1893), by Beatrice Potter (Mrs. Sidney Webb); _Co-operative\r\nProduction_, by Benjamin Jones, 1894; and in the Report of the Fabian\r\nResearch Department on Co-operative Production, published as a\r\nsupplement to _The New Statesman_, February 14, 1914.\r\n\r\n[369] _Address of the Executive Council of the Amalgamated Society of\r\nEngineers to their Fellow-Workmen_, 1855.\r\n\r\n[370] See _The Strikes, their Extent, Evils, and Remedy, being a\r\nDescription of the General Movement of the Mass of the Building\r\nOperatives throughout the United Kingdom_, by Vindex (1853), 56 pp. One\r\nconsequence of this renewed outburst of strikes was the appointment\r\nin 1858 by the newly formed National Association for the Promotion\r\nof Social Science of a Committee to inquire into trade societies and\r\ndisputes. This inquiry, conducted by able and zealous investigators,\r\nresulted in 1860 in the publication of a volume which contains the\r\nbest collection of Trade Union material and the most impartial account\r\nof Trade Union action that has ever been issued. As a source of\r\nhistory and economic illustration this _Report on Trade Societies and\r\nStrikes_ (1860, 651 pp.) is far superior to the Parliamentary Blue\r\nBooks of 1824, 1825, 1838, and 1867-68. Among the contributors were\r\nGodfrey Lushington (afterwards Under-Secretary of State for the Home\r\nDepartment), J. M. Ludlow (afterwards Registrar of Friendly Societies),\r\nThomas (afterwards Judge) Hughes, Q.C., Mr. G. Shaw-Lefevre (afterwards\r\nLord Eversley), F. D. Longe, and Frank Hill. The Committee was presided\r\nover by the late Sir James Kay-Shuttleworth, and amongst its other\r\nmembers may be mentioned W. E. Forster, Henry Fawcett, R. H. Hutton,\r\nRev. F. D. Maurice, Dr. William Farr, and one Trade Union secretary, T.\r\nJ. Dunning, of the London Bookbinders.\r\n\r\n[371] See the account of it in _Labour Legislation, Labour Movements,\r\nand Labour Leaders_, by G. Howell, 1902.\r\n\r\n[372] Prof. E. S. Beesly, _Fortnightly Review_, 1867.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nTHE JUNTA AND THEIR ALLIES\r\n\r\n\r\nMany influences had during the preceding years been co-operating to\r\nform what may almost be described as a cabinet of the Trade Union\r\nMovement. The establishment of such great trade friendly societies as\r\nthe Amalgamated Engineers had created, in some sense, a new school\r\nof Trade Union officials, face to face with intricate problems of\r\nadministration and finance. The presence in London of the headquarters\r\nof these societies brought their salaried officers into close personal\r\nintimacy with each other. And it so happened that during these years\r\nthe little circle of secretaries included men of marked character and\r\nability, who were, both by experience and by temperament, admirably\r\nfitted to guide the movement through the acute crisis which we shall\r\npresently describe.\r\n\r\nForemost in this little group--which we shall hereafter call the\r\nJunta--were the general secretaries of the two amalgamated societies\r\nof Engineers and Carpenters, William Allan and Robert Applegarth,\r\nwhose success in building up these powerful organisations had given\r\nthem great influence in Trade Union councils. Bound to these in close\r\npersonal friendship were Daniel Guile, the general secretary of the old\r\nand important national society of Ironfounders, Edwin Coulson, general\r\nsecretary of the “London Order” of Bricklayers, and George Odger, a\r\nprominent member of a small union of highly skilled makers of ladies’\r\nshoes, and an influential leader of London working-class Radicalism.\r\n\r\nWilliam Allan was the originator of the “New Unionism” of his\r\ntime.[373] We have already described how, with the aid of William\r\nNewton, he had gathered up the scattered fragments of organisation in\r\nthe engineering trade, and had adapted the elaborate constitution and\r\nfinancial system of an old-established society to the needs of a great\r\nnational amalgamation. In long hours of patient labour in the office\r\nhe had built up an extremely methodical, if somewhat cumbrous, system\r\nof financial checks and trade reports, by which the exact position of\r\neach of his tens of thousands of members was at all times recorded in\r\nhis official pigeonholes. The permanence of his system is the best\r\ntestimony to its worth. Even to-day the Engineers’ head office retains\r\nthroughout the impress of Allan’s tireless and methodical industry.\r\nExcessive caution, red-tape precision, an almost miserly solicitude\r\nfor the increase of the society’s funds, were among Allan’s defects.\r\nBut at a time when working men “agitators” were universally credited\r\nwith looseness in money matters and incapacity for strenuous and\r\nregular mental effort, these defects, however equivocal may have been\r\ntheir ultimate effect on the policy and development of the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Engineers, produced a favourable impression on the public.\r\nAllan, moreover, though not a brilliant speaker, or a man of wide\r\ngeneral interests, was a keen working-class politician, whose temper\r\nand judgement could always be depended on. And he has left behind him\r\nthe tradition, not only of absolute integrity and abnormal industry,\r\nbut also of a singular freedom from personal vanity or ambition.\r\n\r\nWhilst Allan aimed at transforming the “paid agitator” into the\r\ntrusted officer of a great financial corporation, Robert Applegarth\r\nsought to win for the Trade Union organisation a recognised social\r\nand political status. Astute and lawyer-like in temperament, he\r\ninstinctively made use of those arguments which were best fitted to\r\novercome the prejudices and disarm the criticisms of middle-class\r\nopponents. Nor did he limit himself to justifying the ways of Trade\r\nUnionists to the world at large. He made persistent attempts to enlarge\r\nthe mental horizon of the rank and file of his own movement, opening\r\nout to those whose vision had hitherto been limited to the strike\r\nand the tap-room, whole vistas of social and political problems in\r\nwhich they as working men were primarily concerned. Hence we find\r\nhim, during his career as general secretary, a leading member of the\r\nfamous “International,”[374] and an energetic promoter of the Labour\r\nRepresentation League, the National Education League, and various\r\nphilanthropic and political associations. Political reformers became\r\neager to secure his adhesion to their projects: he was, for instance,\r\nspecially invited to attend the important conferences of the National\r\nEducation League at Birmingham as the special representative of the\r\nworking classes; and it was owing to his reputation as a social\r\nreformer that he was in 1870 selected to sit on the Royal Commission\r\nupon the Contagious Diseases Acts, thus becoming the first working\r\nman to be styled by his Sovereign “Our Trusty and Well-beloved.”\r\nOpen-minded, alert, and conciliatory, he formed an ideal representative\r\nof the English Labour Movement in the political world.[375]\r\n\r\nThe permanent officials of the Ironfounders and the London Bricklayers\r\nwere men of less originality than Allan or Applegarth. Guile was a man\r\nof attractive personality and winning manner, gifted with a certain\r\nrugged eloquence. Coulson is described by an opponent as being “stolid\r\nand obstinate,” and again as “bricky and stodgy”; but the expansion,\r\nunder his influence, of the little London Society of Bricklayers into\r\na powerful Union of national scope, proves him to have possessed\r\nadministrative ability of no mean order. The special distinction of\r\nall four alike was their business capacity, shown by the persistency\r\nand success with which they pursued, each in his own trade, the policy\r\noriginated by Newton and Allan, of basing Trade Union organisation\r\nupon an insurance company of national extent. George Odger brought to\r\nthe Junta quite other qualities than the cautious industry of Allan\r\nor the lawyer-like capacity of Applegarth. Of the five men we have\r\nmentioned he was the only one who continued to work at his trade, and\r\nwho retained to the last the full flavour of a working-class leader. An\r\norator of remarkable power, he swayed popular meetings at his will, and\r\nwas the idol of Metropolitan Radicalism. But he was no mere demagogue.\r\nBeneath his brilliant rhetoric and emotional fervour there lay a large\r\nmeasure of political shrewdness, and he shared with his colleagues the\r\ncapacity for deliberately concerted action and personal subordination.\r\nHis dilatory and unbusinesslike habits made him incapable of building\r\nup a great organisation. Had he stood alone, he would have added little\r\nto the strength of Trade Unionism; as the loyal adherent of the great\r\nofficials and their popular mouth-piece to the working-class world,\r\nUnionist and non-Unionist alike, he gave the movement a wider basis,\r\nand attracted into its ranks every ardent reformer belonging to the\r\nartisan class.[376]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to-day to convey any adequate idea of the extraordinary\r\npersonal influence exercised by these five men, not only on their\r\nimmediate associates, but also as interpreters of the Trade Union\r\nMovement, upon the public and the governing classes. For the first time\r\nin the century the working-class movement came under the direction,\r\nnot of middle and upper class sympathisers like Place, Owen, Roberts,\r\nO’Connor, or Duncombe, but of genuine workmen specially trained for the\r\nposition. For the first time, moreover, the leaders of working-class\r\npolitics stood together in a compact group, united by a close personal\r\nfriendship, and absolutely free from any trace of that suspiciousness\r\nor disloyalty which have so often marred popular movements. They\r\nbrought to their task, it is true, no consistent economic theory or\r\npolitical philosophy. They subscribed with equal satisfaction to the\r\ncrude Collectivism of the “International,” and the dogmatic industrial\r\nIndividualism of the English Radicals. This absence of a definite basis\r\nto their political activity accounts, we think, for the drying up of\r\nTrade Union politics after their withdrawal. We shall have occasion\r\nhereafter to notice other “defects of their qualities,” and the way in\r\nwhich these subsequently stunted the further development of their own\r\nmovement. But it was largely their very limitations which made them,\r\nat this particular crisis, such valuable representatives of the Trade\r\nUnion Movement. They accepted, with perfect good faith, the economic\r\nIndividualism of their middle-class opponents, and claimed only that\r\nfreedom to combine which the more enlightened members of that class\r\nwere willing to concede to them. Their genuine if somewhat restrained\r\nenthusiasm for political and industrial freedom gave them a persistency\r\nand determination which no check could discourage. Their understanding\r\nof the middle-class point of view, and their appreciation of the\r\npractical difficulties of the situation, saved them from being mere\r\ndemagogues. For the next ten years, when it was all-important to obtain\r\na legal status for trade societies and to obliterate the unfortunate\r\nimpression created by the Sheffield outrages, their qualities exactly\r\nsuited the emergency. The possession of good manners, though it\r\nmay seem a trivial detail, was not the least of their advantages.\r\nTo perfect self-respect and integrity they added correctness of\r\nexpression, habits of personal propriety, and a remarkable freedom\r\nfrom all that savoured of the tap-room. In Allan and Applegarth, Guile,\r\nCoulson, and Odger, the traducers of Trade Unionism found themselves\r\nconfronted with a combination of high personal character, exceptional\r\nbusiness capacity, and a large share of that official decorum which the\r\nEnglish middle class find so impressive.\r\n\r\nRound these central personalities grouped themselves in London a number\r\nof men of like temperament and aims. We have already had occasion to\r\nmention T. J. Dunning, of the Bookbinders, grown old in the service of\r\nTrade Unionism. The building trades contributed a younger generation,\r\nJohn Prior, George Howell, Henry Broadhurst, and George Shipton. The\r\nwhole group were in touch with certain provincial leaders, who adhered\r\nto the new views, and acted in close concert with the Junta. Of these,\r\nthe most noteworthy were Alexander Macdonald, then busily organising\r\nthe Miners’ National Union, John Kane,[377] of the North of England\r\nIronworkers, William Dronfield, the Sheffield compositor, and Alexander\r\nCampbell, the leading spirit of the Glasgow Trades Council.\r\n\r\nThe distinctive policy of the Junta was the combination of extreme\r\ncaution in trade matters and energetic agitation for political\r\nreforms. It is indeed somewhat doubtful how far Allan and Applegarth,\r\nCoulson and Guile shared the popular belief that trade combinations\r\ncould effect a general rise of wages or resist a general reduction\r\nin a falling market. They had more faith in the moral force of great\r\nreserve funds, by the aid of which, dispensed in liberal out-of-work\r\ndonations, one capitalist, or even a whole group of capitalists, might\r\nbe effectually prevented from obtaining labour at anything but the\r\nstandard conditions. Their trade policy was, in fact, restricted to\r\nsecuring for every workman those terms which the best employers were\r\nwilling voluntarily to grant. For this reason they were constantly\r\naccused of apathy by those hotter spirits whose idea of successful\r\nTrade Unionism was a series of general strikes for advances or against\r\nreductions. The Junta were really looking in another direction for the\r\nemancipation of the worker. They believed that a levelling down of all\r\npolitical privileges, and the opening out of educational and social\r\nopportunities to all classes of the community, would bring in its train\r\na large measure of economic equality. Under the influence of these\r\nleaders the London Unions, and eventually those of the provinces, were\r\ndrawn into a whole series of political agitations, for the Franchise,\r\nfor amendment of the Master and Servant law, for new Mines Regulation\r\nActs, for National Education, and finally for the full legalisation of\r\nTrade Unions themselves.\r\n\r\nPractical difficulties hampered the complete execution of the Junta’s\r\npolicy. The use of the Trade Union organisation for Parliamentary\r\nagitation, on which Macdonald, Applegarth, and Odger based all their\r\nexpectations of progress, came as a new idea to the Trade Union\r\nworld. The rank and file of Trade Unionists, still excluded from the\r\nfranchise, took practically no interest in any social or political\r\nreform, and regarded their trade combinations exclusively as means of\r\nextorting a rise of wages or of compelling their fellow-workmen to\r\njoin their clubs. This was especially the case with the provincial\r\norganisations, where the officials usually shared the obscurantism\r\nof their members. The “Manchester Order” of Bricklayers and the\r\nGeneral Union of Carpenters (headquarters, Manchester) were, like the\r\nMidland Brickmakers and the Sheffield Cutlers, still wedded to the\r\nold ideas of secrecy and coercion, whilst the powerful society of\r\nMasons, then centred at Leeds, held aloof from the general movement.\r\nBut this resistance was not confined to the older societies, nor to\r\nthose of any particular locality. All the Unions of that time, even\r\nthose of the Metropolis, retained a strong traditional repugnance to\r\npolitical action. In many cases the rules expressly forbade all mention\r\nof politics in their meetings. And although the societies could be\r\noccasionally induced to take joint action of a political character\r\nin defence of Trade Unionism itself, not even the great influence of\r\nthe Junta upon their own Unions sufficed to persuade the members to\r\nturn their organisations to account for legislative reform. The Junta\r\nturned, therefore, to the newly established Trades Councils and made\r\nthese the political organs of the Trade Union world.\r\n\r\nThe formation between 1858 and 1867 of permanent Trades Councils in the\r\nleading industrial centres was an important step in the consolidation\r\nof the Trade Union Movement. Local delegate meetings, summoned to\r\ndeal with particular emergencies, had been a feature of Trade Union\r\norganisation, at any rate since the beginning of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. In early times every important strike had its committee of\r\nsympathisers from other trade societies, who collected subscriptions\r\nand rendered what personal aid they could. But the most notable of\r\nthese committees were those which started up in all the centres of\r\nTrade Unionism when the movement was threatened by some particular\r\nlegal or Parliamentary danger. Such joint committees had in 1825\r\ncontributed powerfully to defeat the re-enactment of the Combination\r\nLaws, in 1834 to arouse public feeling in the case of the Dorchester\r\nlabourers, and in 1838 to conduct the Trade Union case before the\r\nParliamentary Committee of that year. But these earlier committees were\r\nformed only for particular emergencies, and had, so far as we know, no\r\ncontinuous existence. By 1860 permanent councils were in existence in\r\nGlasgow, Sheffield, Liverpool, and Edinburgh, and their example was, in\r\n1861, followed by the London trades.[378]\r\n\r\nLike many provincial organisations, the London Trades Council\r\noriginated in a “Strike Committee.” During the winter of 1859-60\r\nweekly meetings of delegates from the Metropolitan trades had been\r\nheld to support the Building Operatives in their resistance to the\r\n“document.” “At the termination of that memorable struggle,” states the\r\nSecond Annual Report of the London Trades Council, “it was felt that\r\nsomething should be done to establish a general trades committee so\r\nas to be able on emergency to call the trades together with despatch\r\nfor the purpose of rendering each other advice or assistance as the\r\ncircumstances required.”[379] In March 1860 the provisional committee\r\nformed with this object issued an “Address” to the trades, which\r\nresulted, on July 10, 1860, in the first meeting of the present London\r\nTrades Council.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice that the Council, at the outset, was\r\ncomposed mainly of the representatives of the smaller societies. The\r\nExecutive Committee elected at its first meeting included no delegates\r\nfrom the engineers, compositors, masons, bricklayers, or ironfounders,\r\nwho were then the most influential of the London Trade Societies. The\r\nfirst action of the young Council affords a significant indication\r\nof the feeling of isolation which led to its formation. In order to\r\nfacilitate communications with other trade societies throughout the\r\nkingdom it resolved to compile a _General Trades Union Directory_,\r\ncontaining the names and addresses of all Trade Union secretaries.\r\nThis praiseworthy enterprise took up all the attention of the new\r\nbody for the first year, and the printing of two thousand copies of\r\nthe result of its work crippled its finances for long afterwards. For,\r\nunfortunately, the _General Trades Union Directory_, published at one\r\nshilling per copy, did not sell and was, we fear, soon consigned to\r\nthe pulping mill, as we have, after exhaustive search, been able to\r\ndiscover only two copies in existence.[380]\r\n\r\nBut the direction of the Council was falling into abler hands. In 1861\r\nGeorge Howell became secretary, to be succeeded in the following year\r\nby George Odger, who for the next ten years remained its most prominent\r\nmember. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers joined in 1861, and the\r\nveteran Dunning brought over the old-established Union of Bookbinders.\r\nBy 1864, at any rate, the new organisation was entirely dominated by\r\nthe Junta. The two “amalgamated” societies of Engineers and Carpenters\r\nsupplied, in some years, half its income. The great trade friendly\r\nsociety of Ironfounders and the growing “London Order” of Bricklayers\r\nsent their general secretaries to its meetings. The Council became,\r\nin effect, a joint committee of the officers of the large national\r\nsocieties. In the meetings at the old Bell Inn, under the shadow of\r\nNewgate, we have the beginnings of an informal cabinet of the Trade\r\nUnion world.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile war had again broken out between the master builders and\r\ntheir operatives, caused partly by a renewed agitation for the Nine\r\nHours Day, and partly by the employers’ desire to substitute payment\r\nby the hour for the previous custom of payment by the day.[381] For\r\nthe historian of the general movement the dispute is chiefly important\r\nas furnishing the occasion of the first intervention of the talented\r\ngroup of young barristers and literary men who, from this time forth,\r\nbecame the trusted legal experts and political advisers of the leaders\r\nof the Trade Union Movement. The workmen had totally failed to make\r\nclear their objection to the Hour System, or even to obtain a hearing\r\nof their case. Their position was, for the first time, intelligibly\r\nexplained in two brilliant letters addressed to the newspapers by eight\r\nPositivists and Christian Socialists, which did much to bring about the\r\ntacit compromise in which the struggle ended.[382]\r\n\r\nOf more immediate interest to us is the action taken by the newly\r\nformed London Trades Council. Among the building operations suspended\r\nby the dispute was the construction, by a large contractor, of the\r\nnew Chelsea barracks. The War Department saw no harm in permitting him\r\nto engage the sappers of the Royal Engineers to take the place of the\r\nmen on strike. A similar course had been taken by the Government in\r\nstrikes of 1825 and 1834. But the Trade Unions were now too powerful\r\nto allow of any such interference in their battles. A delegate meeting\r\nof the London trades, comprising representatives of fifty industries\r\nand fifty thousand operatives, sent a deputation to the War Office.\r\nSir George Cornwall Lewis returned at first an equivocal answer, but\r\nthe new Trades Council proved the efficacy of Parliamentary agitation\r\nby getting questions put to the Minister in the House of Commons, and\r\nstirring up enough feeling to compel him to withdraw the troops.\r\n\r\nThe minute-books of the London Trades Council from 1860 to 1867 present\r\na mirror of the Trade Union history of this period. Odger had the fare\r\ngift of making his minutes interesting, and he describes, in his terse\r\nbut graphic English, all the varied events of the Labour Movement as\r\nthey were brought before the Council. In 1861-62, for instance, we see\r\nthe Council trying vainly to settle the difficult problem of “overlap”\r\nbetween the trades of the shipwrights and the iron-shipbuilders; we\r\nnotice the shadow cast by the Lancashire cotton famine, and we read\r\nindignant resolutions condemning the Sheffield outrages of those years.\r\nBut the special interest of these minutes lies in their unconscious\r\nrevelation of the way in which the Council became the instrument of\r\nthe new policy of participation in general politics. Under Odger’s\r\ninfluence the Council took a prominent part in organising the popular\r\nwelcome to Garibaldi, and in 1862 it held a great meeting in St.\r\nJames’s Hall in support of the struggle of the Northern States against\r\nnegro slavery, at which John Bright was the principal speaker. In\r\n1864 the Junta placed itself definitely in opposition to the “Old\r\nUnionists,” who objected to all connection between the Government and\r\nthe concerns of working men. W. E. Gladstone, who was then Chancellor\r\nof the Exchequer, had introduced a Bill enabling the Post Office to\r\nsell Government Annuities for small amounts. Against this harmless\r\nproject George Potter, the leading opponent of the Junta, summoned\r\ngreat public meetings of the London trades, enlisted on his side\r\nthe Operative Stonemasons and other provincial organisations, and\r\nvehemently denounced the Bill as an insidious attempt to divert the\r\nsavings of working men from their Trade Unions and benefit societies\r\ninto an exchequer controlled by the governing classes. The London\r\nTrades Council sent an influential deputation to Gladstone publicly\r\nto disavow the action of Potter, and to welcome the proposal of the\r\nGovernment to utilise the administrative organisation for the advantage\r\nof the working class. Of more significance was the alteration of the\r\nCouncil’s policy with regard to political reform. The early members\r\nhad set themselves against the introduction of politics in any guise\r\nwhatsoever, and during the years 1861-62 Howell and Odger strove in\r\nvain to enlist the Council in the agitation for a new Reform Bill.\r\nBut in 1866, under the influence of Odger and Applegarth, Allan\r\nand Coulson, the Council enthusiastically threw itself into the\r\ndemonstration in favour of the Reform Bill brought in by the Liberal\r\nGovernment, and took a leading part in the agitation which resulted\r\nin the enfranchisement of the town artisan.[383] In the same year the\r\nCouncil agreed to co-operate with the “International” in demanding\r\nDemocratic Reform from all European Governments.\r\n\r\nThe widely advertised public action of the London Trades Council\r\nexcited considerable interest in provincial centres of Trade Unionism.\r\nWe see the Council in frequent correspondence with similar bodies at\r\nGlasgow, Nottingham, Sheffield, and other provincial towns, and often\r\nexercising a kind of informal leadership in general movements. But it\r\nwould be unfair to ascribe the whole initiative in legislative reform\r\nto the London officials. Under the brilliant leadership of Alexander\r\nMacdonald, whose work we shall hereafter describe, the force of the\r\ncoal-miners was being marshalled for Parliamentary agitation; and\r\nMacdonald’s friend, Alexander Campbell, was bringing the Glasgow Trades\r\nCouncil round to the new policy. And it was Campbell and Macdonald,\r\nworking through these organisations, who carried through the most\r\nimportant Trade Union achievement of the next few years, the amendment\r\nof the law relating to master and servant.\r\n\r\nIt is difficult in these days, when equality of treatment before the\r\nlaw has become an axiom, to understand how the flagrant injustice\r\nof the old Master and Servant Acts seemed justifiable even to a\r\nmiddle-class Parliament. If an employer broke a contract of service,\r\neven wilfully and without excuse, he was liable only to be sued for\r\ndamages, or, in the case of wages under £10, to be summoned before a\r\ncourt of summary jurisdiction, which could order payment of the amount\r\ndue. The workman, on the other hand, who wilfully broke his contract\r\nof service, either by absenting himself from his employment, or by\r\nleaving his work, was liable to be proceeded against for a criminal\r\noffence, and punished by three months’ imprisonment. This inequality\r\nof treatment was, moreover, aggravated by various other anomalies. It\r\nfollowed by the general law of evidence that, whilst a master sued by\r\na servant could be witness in his own favour, the servant prosecuted\r\nby his employer could not give evidence on his own behalf; and it\r\nfrequently happened that no other evidence than the employer’s could\r\nbe produced. It was in the power of a single justice of the peace, on\r\nan information on oath, to issue a warrant for the summary arrest of\r\nthe workman, who thus found himself, when a dispute occurred, suddenly\r\nseized, even in his bed,[384] and haled to prison at the discretion of\r\na magistrate, who was in many cases himself an employer of labour. The\r\ncase was heard before a single justice of the peace, and the hearing\r\nmight take place at his private house. The only punishment that could\r\nbe inflicted was imprisonment, the law not allowing the alternative of\r\na fine or the payment of damages. From the decision of the justice,\r\nhowever arbitrary, there was no appeal. Finally, it must be added, the\r\nsentence of imprisonment was no discharge for a debt, so that a workman\r\nwas liable to be imprisoned over and over again for the same breach of\r\ncontract.[385]\r\n\r\nEarly in 1863 Alexander Campbell[386] brought the Master and Servant\r\nLaw under the notice of the Glasgow Trades Council. A Parliamentary\r\nReturn was obtained showing that the enormous number of 10,339 cases\r\nof breach of contract of service came before the courts in a single\r\nyear. A committee was formed to agitate for the amendment of the law,\r\nand communication was opened up, not only with the London leaders, but\r\nalso with sympathisers in other provincial towns. The Trades Councils\r\nof London, Bristol, Sheffield, Nottingham, Newcastle, and Edinburgh\r\nwere formally invited to unite in a combined movement. In Leeds and\r\nelsewhere local Trades Councils were established for the express\r\npurpose of forwarding the agitation; and 15,000 copies of a “Memorial\r\nof Information intended for the use of such workmen as fall under\r\nthe provisions of the Statute 4 Geo. IV. c. 34”[387] were circulated\r\nto all the leading workmen throughout the country. At the instance\r\nof Campbell and Macdonald, the Glasgow Trades Council convened a\r\nconference of Trade Union representatives to consider how the object of\r\nthe agitation could best be secured. This Conference, which was held\r\nin London during four days of May 1864, marks an epoch in Trade Union\r\nhistory. For the first time a national meeting of Trade Union delegates\r\nwas spontaneously convened by a Trade Union organisation to discuss\r\na purely workman’s question, in the presence of working men alone.\r\nThe number of delegates did not exceed twenty, but these included the\r\nleading officials of all the great national and amalgamated Unions.[388]\r\n\r\nThe transactions of the Conference were thoroughly businesslike.\r\nThree members of the Government were asked to receive deputations; a\r\nlarge number of members of Parliament were “lobbied” on the subject\r\nof an immediate amending Bill; and finally a successful meeting of\r\nlegislators was held in the “tea-room” of the House of Commons itself,\r\nat which the delegates impressed their desires upon all the friendly\r\nmembers. The terms of the draft Bill were settled; Cobbett agreed to\r\nintroduce it in the House of Commons, and the Glasgow Trades’ Committee\r\nwas authorised to support it by an agitation on behalf of all the Trade\r\nUnions of the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Bill introduced by Cobbett never became law; but a vigorous\r\nagitation kept the matter under the notice of Parliament, and in 1866\r\na Select Committee was appointed to inquire into the subject. Upon\r\nits report Lord Elcho[389] succeeded, in 1867, in carrying through\r\nParliament a Bill which remedied the grossest injustice of the law.\r\nThe Master and Servant Act of 1867 (30 & 31 Vic. c. 141), the first\r\npositive success of the Trade Unions in the legislative field, did much\r\nto increase their confidence in Parliamentary agitation.\r\n\r\nBut whilst the Junta and their allies were, by the capture of the\r\nTrades Councils, using the Trade Union organisation for an active\r\npolitical campaign, their steady discouragement of aggressive strikes\r\nwas bringing down upon them the wrath of the “Old Unionists” of the\r\ntime. It was one of the principal functions of the London Trades\r\nCouncil to grant “credentials” to trade societies having disputes on\r\nhand, recommending them for the support of workmen in other trades.\r\nAs these credentials were not confined to London disputes, the custom\r\nplaced the Council under the invidious necessity of either giving\r\nits sanction to, or withholding approval from, practically every\r\nimportant strike in the kingdom--an arrangement which quickly brought\r\nthe Council into conflict with the more aggressive societies. In two\r\ncases especially the divergence of policy raised serious and heated\r\ndiscussions. A building trades strike had broken out in the Midlands\r\nat the beginning of 1864, initiated by the old Friendly Society (now\r\nstyled the General Union) of Operative Carpenters. The men’s action was\r\nstrongly disapproved by Applegarth and the Executive of the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Carpenters. The London Trades Council unhesitatingly took\r\nApplegarth’s view, thereby alienating whole sections of the building\r\ntrades, whose local trade clubs and provincial societies had retained\r\nmuch of the spirit of the Builders’ Union of 1834. But the internal\r\ndissension arising from the carpenters’ dispute fell far short of\r\nthat brought about by the strike of the Staffordshire puddlers. It is\r\nunnecessary to go into the details of this angry struggle against a 10\r\nper cent reduction. The conduct of the men in refusing the arbitration\r\noffered by the Earl of Lichfield met with the disapproval of the\r\nLondon Trades Council. The hotter spirits were greatly incensed at\r\nthe Council’s moderation. George Potter, in particular, distinguished\r\nhimself by addressing excited meetings of the men on strike, advising\r\nthem to stand firm.\r\n\r\nPotter, who figures largely in the newspapers of this time, was in\r\nfact endeavouring to work up a formidable opposition to the policy of\r\nthe Junta. After the building trades disputes of 1859-60, in which\r\nhe had taken a leading part, he had started the _Beehive_, a weekly\r\norgan of the Trade Union world. Himself a member of a tiny trade club\r\nof London carpenters, he was bitterly opposed to Applegarth and the\r\nAmalgamated Society, and from 1864 onward we find him at the head of\r\nevery outbreak of disaffection. An expert in the arts of agitation\r\nand of advertisement, Potter occasionally cut a remarkable figure, so\r\nthat the unwary reader, not of the _Beehive_ only, but also of the\r\n_Times_, might easily believe him to have been the most influential\r\nleader of the working-class movement. As a matter of fact, he at no\r\ntime represented any genuine trade organisation, the “Working Men’s\r\nAssociation,” of which he was president, being an unimportant society\r\nof nondescript persons. However, from 1864 to 1867 we find him calling\r\nfrequent meetings of delegates of the London trades to denounce the\r\nJunta, and their instrument, the London Trades Council. The minutes of\r\nthe latter body contain abundant evidence of the bitter feelings caused\r\nby these attacks, and make clear the essential difference between\r\nthe two policies. At a special meeting called to condemn Potter’s\r\naction, Howell, Allan, Coulson, and Applegarth enlarged upon the evil\r\nconsequences of irresponsible agitation in trade disputes; and Danter,\r\nthe outspoken president of the Amalgamated Engineers, emphatically\r\ndeclared that Potter “had become the aider and abettor of strikes. He\r\nthought of nothing else; he followed no other business; strikes were\r\nhis bread-and-cheese; in short, he was a strike-jobber, and he made\r\nthe _Beehive_ newspaper his instrument for pushing his nose into every\r\nunfortunate dispute that sprang up.”[390]\r\n\r\nResponsible and cautious leadership of the Trade Union Movement was\r\nbecoming increasingly necessary. The growth of the great national\r\nUnions, alike in wealth and in membership, and the manner in which\r\nthey subscribed in aid of each other’s battles, had aroused the active\r\nenmity of the employers. To counteract the men’s renewed strength, the\r\nemployers once more banded themselves into powerful associations, and\r\nmade use of a new weapon. The old expedient of the “document” had,\r\nsince its failure to break down the Amalgamated Engineers in 1852,\r\nand to subdue the building operatives in 1859, fallen somewhat into\r\ndiscredit. It was now reinforced by the general “lock-out” of all the\r\nmen in a particular industry, even those who accepted the employer’s\r\nterms, in order to reduce to subjection the recalcitrant employees of\r\none or two firms only.[391] The South Yorkshire coal-owners especially\r\ndistinguished themselves during those years by their frequent use of\r\nthe “lock-out.” One Yorkshire miner complained in 1866 that he had been\r\n“locked out about twenty-four months in six years.”[392] During the\r\nyear 1865 it seemed as if the lock-outs were about to become a feature\r\nof every large industry, the most notable instances being those of\r\nthe Staffordshire ironworkers, to which we have already alluded, and\r\nthe shipbuilding operatives on the Clyde. In both these cases large\r\nsections of the men were willing to work at the employers’ terms, but\r\nwere either known to belong to a Union or suspected of contributing to\r\nthe men on strike. But though this practice of “locking out” created\r\ngreat excitement among working men, it did not achieve the employers’\r\naim of breaking up the Unions. Nothing but absolute suppression by law\r\nappeared open to those who regarded trade combinations as “a poisonous\r\nplant” and an “anomalous anachronism,” and who were vainly looking\r\nto “the happy period,” both for masters and men, when the questions,\r\n“What is the price of a quarter of wheat?” and “What is the price of a\r\nworkman’s day wage?” shall be settled on the same principles.[393]\r\n\r\nNor were the employers the only people who began to talk once more of\r\nputting down Trade Unions by law. The industrial dislocation which the\r\nlock-outs, far more than the strikes, produced occasioned widespread\r\nloss and public inconvenience. The quarrels of employer and employed\r\ncame to be vaguely regarded as matters of more than private concern.\r\nUnfortunately a handle was given to the enemies of Trade Unionism by\r\nthe continuance of outrages, committed in the interest of Trade Unions,\r\nwhich began to be widely advertised by the press. Isolated cases of\r\nviolence and intimidation, restricted, as we shall hereafter see, to\r\ncertain trades and localities, were magnified by press rumours into a\r\nsystematic attempt on the part of the Trade Unions generally to obtain\r\ntheir ends by deliberate physical violence. In the general fear and\r\ndisapproval the public failed to discriminate between the petty trade\r\nclubs of Sheffield and such great associations as the Amalgamated\r\nEngineers and Carpenters. The commercial objection to industrial\r\ndisputes became confused with the feeling of abhorrence created by\r\nthe idea of vast combinations of men sticking at neither violence\r\nnor murder to achieve their ends. The “terrorism of Trade Unions”\r\nbecame a nightmare. “On one side,” says a writer who represents the\r\npublic feeling of the time, “is arrayed the great mass of the talent,\r\nknowledge, virtue, and wealth of the country, and, on the other, a\r\nnumber of unscrupulous men, leading a half-idle life, and feeding on\r\nthe contributions of their dupes, and on a tax levied on such of the\r\nintelligent artisans as are forced into their ranks, but who would be\r\nonly too happy to throw off their thraldom and join the supporters of\r\nlaw and justice, did these but offer them adequate protection.”[394]\r\n\r\nThe Trade Unions world seems to have been quite unconscious of the\r\ngathering storm. In June 1866 138 delegates, representing all the great\r\nUnions, and a total membership of about 200,000, met at Sheffield to\r\ndevise some defence against the constant use of the lock-out. The\r\nstudent of the proceedings of this conference will contrast with wonder\r\nthe actual conduct of the Trade Union leaders with the denunciations\r\nto which these “few unscrupulous men” were at this time exposed.\r\nNothing could be more worthy, even from the middle-class point of\r\nview, than the discussions of these representative workmen, who\r\ndenounced with equal energy the readiness with which their impetuous\r\nfollowers came out on strike and the arbitrary lock-out of the masters,\r\nand whose resolutions express their desire for the establishment\r\nof Councils of Conciliation and the general resort to arbitration\r\nin industrial disputes.[395] Meanwhile, in order to meet the great\r\nfederations of employers, they formed “The United Kingdom Alliance\r\nof Organised Trades,” to support the members of any trade who should\r\nfind themselves “locked out” by their employers.[396] Unfortunately\r\nthe conference utterly failed to decide what constituted a “lock-out,”\r\nas distinguished from a strike; and the “Judicial Council” of the\r\nAlliance, consisting of one delegate from each of the nine districts\r\ninto which the kingdom was divided, found itself continually at\r\nissue with its constituents as to the disputes to be supported. This\r\nfriction co-operated with the increasing depression of trade in causing\r\nthe calls for funds to be very unwillingly responded to; and the\r\nExecutive Committee, sitting at Sheffield, had seldom any cash at its\r\ncommand. The Alliance lingered on until about the end of 1870, when\r\nthe defection of its last important Unions brought it absolutely to\r\nan end.[397] In 1866, however, the Alliance was young and hopeful.\r\nIt received its first blow in October of this year, when it and the\r\nTrade Union Conference were forgotten in the sensation produced by the\r\nexplosion of a can of gunpowder in a workman’s house in New Hereford\r\nStreet, Sheffield.\r\n\r\nThis outrage was only one of a class of crimes for which Sheffield was\r\nalready notorious. But in the state of public irritation against Trade\r\nUnionism, which had been growing during the past few years of lock-outs\r\nand strikes, the news served to precipitate events. On all sides\r\nthere arose a cry for a searching investigation into Trade Unionism.\r\nThe Trade Unions themselves joined in the demand. As no clue to the\r\nperpetrators of the last crime could be discovered by the local police,\r\nthe leaders of the Sheffield trade clubs united with the Town Council\r\nand the local Employers’ Association in pressing for a Government\r\ninquiry. The London Trades Council and the Executive of the Amalgamated\r\nEngineers sent a joint deputation to Sheffield to investigate the case.\r\nThe deputation discovered no more than the local police had done about\r\nthe perpetrators of the crime, and therefore innocently reported that\r\nthere was no evidence of Trade Union complicity; but they accompanied\r\nthis report by a strong condemnation of “the abominable practice of\r\nrattening, which is calculated to demoralise those who are concerned\r\nin it, and to bring disgrace on all trade combinations.”[398] Public\r\nmeetings of Trade Unionists were held throughout the country, at\r\nwhich the leaders expressed their indignation both at the outrage\r\nitself and at the common assumption that it was a usual and necessary\r\nincident of Trade Unionism. These meetings invariably concluded with a\r\ndemand on behalf of the Trade Unionists to be allowed an opportunity\r\nof refuting the accusations of the enemies of the movement. Robert\r\nApplegarth saw the Home Secretary on the subject, and suggested a\r\nCommission of Inquiry. The appointment of a Royal Commission of Inquiry\r\nwas officially announced in the Queen’s Speech of February 1867. That\r\nthe Government meant business was proved by the prompt introduction\r\nof a Bill empowering the Commission to pursue its investigations by\r\nexceptional means. The inquiry was to extend to all outrages during\r\nthe past ten years, whether in Sheffield or elsewhere. Not only were\r\naccomplices in criminal acts promised an indemnity, provided that\r\nthey gave evidence, but the same privilege was extended to the\r\nactual perpetrators of the crimes. The investigation, moreover, was\r\nnot restricted to the supposed criminal practices of particular trade\r\nclubs, but was to embrace the whole subject of Trade Unionism and its\r\neffects.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Union movement thus found itself for the third time at the\r\nbar of a Parliamentary inquiry at a moment when public opinion, as\r\nwell as the enmity of employers, had been strongly excited against it.\r\nAt the very height of this crisis, which had been brought about by\r\nthe violence of some of the old-fashioned Unions, the new Amalgamated\r\nSocieties themselves received a serious check from a decision of the\r\nCourt of Queen’s Bench.\r\n\r\nThe formation of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, with its large\r\naccumulated funds, had renewed the anxiety of the Trade Union officials\r\nas to the extent to which a trade society enjoyed the protection of the\r\nlaw. Although the Act of 1825 had made trade societies, as such, no\r\nlonger unlawful, nothing had been done to give them any legal status,\r\nor to enable them to take proceedings as corporate entities. But in\r\n1855 a “Metropolitan Trades Committee” succeeded in getting a clause\r\nintended to relate to Trade Unions inserted in the Friendly Societies\r\nAct of that year. By the 44th section of this Act it was provided\r\nthat a society established for any purpose not illegal might, by\r\ndepositing its rules with the Registrar of Friendly Societies, enjoy\r\nthe privilege of having disputes among its own members summarily dealt\r\nwith by the magistrates. Under this provision several of the larger\r\nsocieties had deposited their rules, believing, with the concurrence\r\nof the Registrar, that this secured to them the power to proceed\r\nsummarily against any member who should, in his capacity of secretary\r\nor treasurer, detain or make away with the society’s funds.[399] So\r\nthoroughly has the legality of their position been accepted by all\r\nconcerned, that on the establishment by Gladstone of the Post Office\r\nSavings Banks in 1861, he had, at the request of the Trade Union\r\nleaders, expressly conceded to the Unions, equally with the Friendly\r\nSocieties, the privilege of making use of the new banks.\r\n\r\nThis feeling of security was, in 1867, completely shattered. The\r\nBoilermakers’ Society had occasion to proceed against the treasurer\r\nof their Bradford branch for wrongfully withholding the sum of £24;\r\nbut the magistrates, to the general surprise of all concerned, held\r\nthat the society could not proceed under the Friendly Societies Act,\r\nbeing, as a Trade Union, outside the scope of that measure. The case\r\nwas thereupon carried to the Court of Queen’s Bench, where four judges,\r\nheaded by the Lord Chief Justice, confirmed the decision, giving the\r\nadditional reason that the objects of the Union, if not, since 1825,\r\nactually criminal, were yet so far in restraint of trade as to render\r\nthe society an illegal association. Thus the officers of the great\r\nnational Trade Unions found their societies deprived of the legal\r\nstatus which they imagined they had acquired, and saw themselves once\r\nmore destitute of any legal protection for their accumulated funds.\r\n\r\nThe grounds of the decision went a great deal further than the decision\r\nitself. As was pointed out to the workmen by Frederic Harrison, “the\r\njudgement lays down not merely that certain societies have failed\r\nto bring themselves within the letter of a certain Act, but that\r\nTrade Unions, of whatever sort, are in their nature contrary to\r\npublic policy, and that their object in itself will vitiate every\r\nassociation and every transaction into which it enters.... In a word,\r\nUnionism becomes (if not according to the suggestion of the learned\r\njudge--criminal) at any rate something like betting and gambling,\r\npublic nuisances and immoral considerations--things condemned and\r\nsuppressed by the law.”[400]\r\n\r\nTrade Unionism was now at bay, assailed on both sides. It was easy to\r\nforesee that the employers and their allies would make a determined\r\nattempt to use the Royal Commission and the Sheffield outrages to\r\nsuppress Trade Unionism by the criminal law. On the other hand, the\r\nhard-earned accumulations of the larger societies, by this time\r\namounting to an aggregate of over a quarter of a million sterling, were\r\nat the mercy of their whole army of branch secretaries and treasurers,\r\nany one of whom might embezzle the funds with impunity.\r\n\r\nThe crisis was too serious to be dealt with by the excited delegate\r\nmeetings of the London Trades Council. For over four years we hear of\r\nonly occasional and purely formal meetings of this body. Immediately\r\non the publication of the decision of the judges in January 1867\r\nApplegarth convened what was called a “Conference of Amalgamated\r\nTrades,” but what consisted in reality of weekly private meetings\r\nof the five leaders and a few other friends. From 1867 to 1871 this\r\n“conference” acted as the effective cabinet of the Trade Union\r\nMovement. Its private minute-book, kept by Applegarth, reveals to the\r\nstudent the whole political life of the Trade Union world.\r\n\r\nThe first action of the Junta was to call to their councils those\r\nmiddle-class allies upon whose assistance and advice they had learned\r\nto rely. We have already noticed the adhesion of the “Christian\r\nSocialists” to the Amalgamated Engineers in 1852, and the intervention\r\nof the Positivists in the Building Trades disputes of 1859-61. Frederic\r\nHarrison and E. S. Beesly were now rendering specially valuable\r\nservices as the apologists for Trade Unionism in the public press.\r\n“Tom Hughes” was in Parliament, almost the only spokesman of the men’s\r\nwhole claim. Henry Crompton was bringing his acute judgement and his\r\ndetailed experience of the actual working of the law to bear upon the\r\ndangers which beset the Unions in the Courts of Justice. Applegarth’s\r\nminutes show how frequently all four were ready to spend hours in\r\nprivate conference at the Engineers’ office in Stamford Street, and how\r\nunreservedly they, in this crisis, placed their professional skill\r\nat the disposal of the Trade Union leaders. It would be difficult to\r\nexaggerate the zeal and patient devotion of these friends of Trade\r\nUnionism, or the service which they rendered to the cause in its hour\r\nof trial.[401]\r\n\r\nIt is obvious from the private transactions of the conference that the\r\nmain object of the Junta was to gain for Trade Unionism that legal\r\nstatus which was necessary alike to the security of the funds and\r\nto the recognition of the Trade Union organisation as a constituent\r\npart of the State. But the first thing to be done was to defeat\r\nthe employers in their endeavour to use the Royal Commission as an\r\ninstrument for suppressing Trade Unionism by direct penal enactment.\r\nThe Junta had therefore not only to dissociate themselves from the\r\nignorant turbulence of the old-fashioned Unions, but also to prove that\r\nthe bulk of their own members were enlightened and respectable. It was,\r\nmoreover, of the utmost importance to persuade the public that the\r\nJunta and their friends, not the strike-jobbers or the outrage-mongers,\r\nwere the authorised and typical representatives of the Trade Union\r\nMovement. All this it was necessary to bring out in the inquiry by the\r\nRoyal Commission before which Trade Unionism was presently to stand on\r\nits defence. The composition of the Commission was accordingly a matter\r\nof the greatest concern for the Junta. The Government had resolved\r\nto select, as Commissioners, not representatives of each view, but\r\npersons presumably impartial, with Sir William Erle, who had lately\r\nretired from the Lord Chief Justiceship of the Common Pleas, as their\r\nchairman. In this arrangement representatives of the employers were to\r\nbe excluded; and the appointment of working men was not dreamed of. The\r\nCommission was to be made up chiefly from the ranks of high officials,\r\nwith four members from the two Houses of Parliament, and the chairman\r\nof a great industrial undertaking. The active part which Thomas Hughes\r\nhad taken in the debates secured him a seat on the Commission, though\r\nhe felt that single-handed he could do little for his friends. All\r\npossible pressure was accordingly brought to bear on the Government\r\nwith a view to the appointment of a Trade Unionist member; but the idea\r\nof a working-man Royal Commissioner was inconsistent with official\r\ntraditions. The utmost that could be obtained was that the workmen and\r\nthe employers should each suggest a special representative to be added.\r\nFor the workmen a wise and extremely fortunate choice was made in the\r\nperson of Frederic Harrison, the Junta obtaining also permission for\r\nrepresentative Trade Unionists to be present during the examination of\r\nthe witnesses.[402]\r\n\r\nThe actual conduct of the Trade Unionist case was undertaken by\r\nHarrison and Hughes, in consultation with Applegarth, whom the Junta\r\ndeputed to attend the sittings on their behalf. The ground of defence\r\nwas chosen with considerable shrewdness. The policy of the Junta and\r\ntheir allies was to focus the attention of the Commissioners upon the\r\ngreat trade friendly societies in contradistinction to the innumerable\r\nlittle local trade clubs of the old type. The evidence of Applegarth,\r\nwho was the first witness examined, did much to dispel the grosser\r\nprejudices against the Unions. The General Secretary of the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Carpenters was able to show that his society, then standing\r\nthird in financial magnitude in the Trade Union world, far from\r\nfomenting strikes, was mainly occupied in the work of an insurance\r\ncompany. He was in a position to lay effective stress on the total\r\nabsence of secrecy or coercion in its proceedings. He disclaimed, on\r\nbehalf of its members, all objection to machinery, foreign imports,\r\npiecework, overtime, or the free employment of apprentices. The\r\nfundamental position upon which he entrenched his Trade Unionism was\r\nthe maintenance, at all hazards, of the Standard Rate of Wages and the\r\nStandard Hours of Labour, to be secured by the accumulation of such a\r\nfund as would enable every member of the Union effectually to set a\r\nreserve-price on his labour. William Allan, who came up on the third\r\nday, followed Applegarth’s lead, though with some reservations; and the\r\nevidence of these two officers of what were primarily national friendly\r\nsocieties made a marked impression on the Commission.\r\n\r\nThe employers were not as well served as the men. It is true that\r\nthey succeeded, in spite of Applegarth’s disclaimers, in persuading\r\nthe Commission that some of the most powerful Unions strenuously\r\nobjected to piecework and sub-contract in any form whatsoever, and\r\nin some instances even to machinery. In other cases it was proved\r\nthat attempts were made to enforce a rigid limitation of apprentices.\r\nOwing to the energy of the Central Association of Master Builders,\r\nthe restrictive policy of the older Unions in the building trades was\r\nbrought well to the front; and this fact accounts, even to-day, for\r\nmost of the current impression of Trade Unionism among the middle\r\nand upper classes. But the employers did not discriminate in their\r\nattack. Almost with one accord they objected to the whole principle\r\nof Trade Unionism. They reiterated with a curious impenetrability the\r\nold argument of the “individual bargain,” and protested against any\r\nkind of industrial organisation on the part of their employees. All\r\nattempts by the men to claim collectively any share in regulating the\r\nconditions of labour were denounced as “unwarrantable encroachments on\r\ntheir rights as employers.” The number of apprentices, like indeed\r\nthe whole administration of industry, was claimed as of private\r\nconcern, the settlement of which “exclusively belongs to the employer\r\nhimself; a matter in which no other party, much less the operatives,\r\nhave got anything to do.” And they objected even more to the centrally\r\nadministered national society with extensive reserve funds than to the\r\nisolated local clubs whose spasmodic outbursts they could afford to\r\ndisregard. But the confusion between the small local bodies with their\r\nnarrow policy of outrage and violence, and the amalgamated societies\r\nwith their far-reaching power and accumulated wealth, effective as it\r\nhad been in alarming the public, proved disastrous to the employers\r\nwhen their case was subjected to the acute cross-examination of\r\nFrederic Harrison. The masters, by directing their attack mainly on the\r\ngreat Amalgamated Societies and the newly-formed local Trades Councils,\r\nplayed, in fact, directly into the hands of the Junta. It was easy for\r\nAllan and Applegarth to show that the influence of central Executive\r\nCouncils and the formation of a public opinion among trade societies\r\ntended to restrain the more aggressive action of men embittered by a\r\nlocal quarrel. The combination of friendly benefits with trade objects\r\nwas destined to be hotly attacked twenty years later by the more ardent\r\nspirits in the Trade Union world, as leading to inertia and supineness\r\nin respect of wages, hours, and conditions of labour. The evidence\r\nadduced in 1867-8, read in the light of later events, reveals that this\r\ntendency had already begun; and it was impossible for the Commissioners\r\nto resist the conclusion that they had, in the Amalgamated Engineers\r\nand Carpenters, types of a far less aggressive Trade Unionism than\r\nsuch survivals as the purely trade societies of the brickmakers or the\r\nSheffield industries.\r\n\r\nFoiled in this attempt the employers fell back upon an indictment of\r\nthe Amalgamated Unions considered as friendly societies. The leading\r\nactuaries were called to prove that neither the Amalgamated Engineers\r\nnor the Amalgamated Carpenters could possibly meet their accumulating\r\nliabilities, and that these must, in a few years, inevitably bring\r\nboth societies to bankruptcy. The whole of this evidence is a striking\r\ninstance of the untrustworthiness of expert witnesses off their own\r\nground. Neither Finlaison nor Tucker, who were called as actuaries\r\non behalf of the employers, ever realised that a Trade Union, unlike\r\na Friendly Society, possesses and constantly exercises an unlimited\r\npower to raise funds by special levies, or by increased contributions,\r\nwhenever it may seem good to the majority of the members. But even had\r\nthe actuarial indictment been completely warranted, it was a mistake\r\nin tactics on the part of the employers. The Commissioners found\r\nthemselves shunted into an inquiry, not into the results of Trade\r\nUnionism upon the common weal, but into the arithmetical soundness of\r\nthe financial arrangements which particular groups of workmen chose to\r\nmake among themselves.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the primary business of the Commission, the investigation\r\ninto the Sheffield outrages, had been remitted to special “examiners,”\r\nwhose local inquiry attracted far less attention than the proceedings\r\nof the main body. At first the investigation elicited little that was\r\nnew; but in June 1867 the country was startled by dramatic confessions\r\non the part of Broadhead and other members of the grinders’ trade\r\nclubs, unravelling a series of savage crimes instigated by them, and\r\npaid for out of Club funds. For a short time it looked as if all the\r\nvague accusations hurled at Trade Unionism at large were about to be\r\njustified; but the examiners reported that four-fifths of the societies\r\neven of the Sheffield trades were free from outrages, and that these\r\nhad been most prevalent from 1839 to 1861, and had since declined. The\r\nonly other place in which the Commissioners thought it necessary to\r\nmake inquiry into outrages was Manchester, where the Brickmakers’ Union\r\nhad committed many crimes, but where no complicity on the part of other\r\ntrades was shown. It was made evident to all candid students that\r\nthese criminal acts were not chargeable to Trade Unionism as a whole.\r\nThey represented, in fact, the survival among such rough and isolated\r\ntrades as the brickmakers and grinders of the barbarous usages of a\r\ntime when working men felt themselves outside the law, and oppressed by\r\ntyranny.[403]\r\n\r\nThe success with which the case of the Trade Unionists had been\r\npresented to the Commission was reflected in a changed attitude on\r\nthe part of the governing class, a change expressly attributed to\r\nthe “greater knowledge and wider experience” of Trade Unions which\r\nhad been gained through the Royal Commission. “True statesmanship,”\r\ndeclared the _Times_, “will seek neither to augment nor to reduce\r\ntheir influence, but, accepting it as a fact, will give it free scope\r\nfor legitimate development.”[404] Thus the official report of the\r\nCommission, from which the enemies of Trade Unionism had hoped so much,\r\ncontained no recommendation which would have made the position of any\r\nsingle Union worse than it was before. An inconclusive and somewhat\r\ninconsistent document, it argued that trade combination could be of no\r\nreal economic advantage to the workman, but nevertheless recommended\r\nthe legalisation of the Unions under certain conditions. Whereas the\r\nAct of 1825 had excepted from the common illegality only combinations\r\nin respect of wages or hours of labour, the Commissioners recommended\r\nthat no combination should henceforth be liable to prosecution for\r\nrestraint of trade, except those formed “to do acts which involved\r\nbreach of contract,” and to refuse to work with any particular person.\r\nBut the privilege of registration, carrying with it the power to obtain\r\nlegal protection for the society’s funds, was to be conferred only on\r\nUnions whose rules were free from certain restrictive clauses, such\r\nas the limitation of apprentices or of the use of machinery, and the\r\nprohibition of piecework and sub-contract. The employers’ influence on\r\nthe Commission was further shown in a special refusal of the privilege\r\nof registration to societies whose rules authorised the support of the\r\ndisputes of other trades.\r\n\r\nSo far the result of the Commission was purely negative. No hostile\r\nlegislation was even suggested. On the other hand, it was obvious that\r\nno Trade Union would accept “legalisation” on the proposed conditions.\r\nBut Harrison and Hughes had not restricted themselves to casting out\r\nall dangerous proposals from the majority report. Their minority\r\nreport, which was signed also by the Earl of Lichfield, exposed in\r\nterse paragraphs the futility of the suggestions made by the majority,\r\nand laid down in general terms the principles upon which all future\r\nlegislation should proceed. It advocated the removal of all special\r\nlegislation relating to labour contracts, on the principle, first,\r\nthat no act should be illegal if committed by a workman unless it was\r\nequally illegal if committed by any other person; and secondly, that\r\nno act by a combination of men should be regarded as criminal if it\r\nwould not have been criminal in a single person. To this was appended\r\na detailed statement, drafted by Frederic Harrison, in which the\r\ncharacter and objects of Trade Unionism, as revealed in the voluminous\r\nevidence taken by the Commission, were explained and defended with\r\nconsummate skill. What was perhaps of even greater service to the\r\nTrade Union world was a precise and detailed exposition of the various\r\namendments required to bring the law into accordance with the general\r\nprinciples referred to. We have here a striking instance of the\r\nadvantage to a Labour Movement of expert professional advice. The Junta\r\nhad been demanding the complete legalisation of their Unions in the\r\nsame manner as ordinary Friendly Societies. They had failed to realise\r\nthat such a legalisation would have exposed the Amalgamated Society of\r\nEngineers to be sued by one of its members who might be excluded for\r\n“blacklegging,” or otherwise working contrary to the interests of the\r\ntrade. The whole efficacy, from a Trade Union point of view, of the\r\namalgamation of trade and friendly benefits would have been destroyed.\r\nThe bare legalisation would have brought the Trades Unions under the\r\ngeneral law, and subjected them to constant and harassing interference\r\nby Courts of Justice. They had grown up in despite of the law and the\r\nlawyers; which as regards the spirit of the one and the prejudices of\r\nthe other were, and still are, alien and hostile to the purposes and\r\ncollective action of the Trades Societies. The danger of any member\r\nhaving power to take legal proceedings, to worry them by litigation and\r\ncripple them by legal expenses, or to bring a society within the scope\r\nof the insolvency and bankruptcy law, became very apparent. The Junta\r\neasily realised, when their advisers explained the position, that mere\r\nlegalisation would place the most formidable weapon in the hands of\r\nunscrupulous employers. To avoid this difficulty Harrison proposed the\r\ningenious plan of bringing the Trade Union under the Friendly Societies\r\nActs, so far as regards the protection of its funds against theft or\r\nfraud, whilst retaining to the full the exceptional legal privilege\r\nof being incapable of being sued or otherwise proceeded against as\r\na corporate entity. Had a Trade Union official been selected as the\r\nsole representative of the Unions on the Commission, such detailed and\r\ningenious amendments of the law would not have been devised and made\r\npart of an authoritative official report. The complete charter of Trade\r\nUnion liberty, which Harrison and his friends had elaborated, became\r\nfor seven years the political programme of the Trade Unionists. And it\r\nis a part of the curious irony of English party politics that whilst\r\nthe formation of this programme, and the agitation by which it was\r\npressed on successive Parliaments, were both of them exclusively the\r\nwork of a group of Radicals it was, as we shall see, a Conservative\r\nCabinet which eventually passed it into law.[405]\r\n\r\nThe effective though informal leadership of the movement which the\r\nJunta had assumed during the sittings of the Royal Commission had\r\nnot gone entirely unquestioned. Those who are interested in the\r\ncross-currents of personal intrigues and jealousies which detract from\r\nthe force of popular movements can read in the pages of the _Beehive_\r\nfull accounts of the machinations of George Potter. The _Beehive_\r\nsummoned a Trade Union Conference at St. Martin’s Hall in March 1867,\r\nwhich was attended by over one hundred delegates from provincial\r\nsocieties, Trades Councils, and the minor London clubs.[406] The Junta,\r\nperhaps rather unwisely, refused to have anything to do with a meeting\r\nheld under Potter’s auspices. But many of their provincial allies came\r\nup without any suspicion of the sectional character of the conference,\r\nand found themselves in the anomalous position of countenancing\r\nwhat was really an attempt to seduce the London Trades from their\r\nallegiance to the Junta and the London Trades Council. The Conference\r\nsat for four days, and made, owing to Potter’s energy, no little stir.\r\nA committee was appointed to conduct the Trade Union case before the\r\nCommission, and Conolly, the President of the Operative Stonemasons,\r\nwas deputed to attend the sittings. But although special prominence\r\nwas given by the _Beehive_ to all the proceedings of this committee,\r\nwe have failed to discover with what it actually concerned itself. An\r\nindiscreet speech by Conolly quickly led to his exclusion from the\r\nsittings of the Commission; and the management of the Trade Union case\r\nremained in the hands of Applegarth and the Junta.\r\n\r\nApart, however, from jealousy and personal intrigue, there was some\r\ngenuine opposition to the policy of the Junta. The great mass of\r\nTrade Unionists were not yet converted to the necessity of obtaining\r\nfor their societies a recognised legal status. There were even many\r\nexperienced officials, especially in the provincial organisations\r\nof the older type, who deprecated the action that was being taken\r\nby the London leaders, on the express ground that they objected to\r\nlegalisation. “The less working men have to do with the law in any\r\nshape the better,” was the constant note of the old Unionists. This\r\nview found abundant expression at the Congresses convened in 1868 by\r\nthe Manchester Trades Council, and in 1869 by that of Birmingham. But\r\nin spite of the absence of the Junta from the Manchester Congress,\r\ntheir friend, John Kane, of the North of England Ironworkers’\r\nAssociation, succeeded in inducing the delegates to pass a resolution\r\nexpressing full confidence in the policy and action of the Conference\r\nof Amalgamated Trades.[407] And at the Congress of 1869, Odger and\r\nHowell, as representatives of the Junta, managed to get adopted a\r\nseries of resolutions embodying Frederic Harrison’s proposals.[408]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile a change had come over the political situation. At the\r\noutset of the crisis Frederic Harrison had urged upon the Trade Union\r\nworld the necessity of turning to the polling booth for redress.\r\n“Nothing,” he writes in January, 1867, “will force the governing\r\nclasses to recognise [the workmen’s] claims and judge them fairly,\r\nuntil they find them wresting into their own hands real political\r\npower. Unionists who, till now, have been content with their Unions,\r\nand have shrunk from political action, may see the pass to which this\r\nabstinence from political movements has brought them.”[409] Within a\r\nfew months of this advice the Reform Bill of 1867 had enfranchised the\r\nworking man in the boroughs. The Trade Union leaders were not slow to\r\nuse the advantage thus given to them. The Junta, under the convenient\r\ncloak of the Conference of Amalgamated Trades, issued, in July, 1868,\r\na circular urging upon Trade Unionists the importance of registering\r\ntheir names as electors, and of pressing on every candidate the\r\nquestion in which they were primarily interested. The Trades Councils\r\nthroughout the country followed suit; and we find the Junta’s electoral\r\ntactics adopted even by societies which were traditionally opposed to\r\nall political action. The Central Committee of the Stonemasons, for\r\ninstance, strongly urged their members to vote at the ensuing election\r\nonly for candidates who would support Trade Union demands.[410]\r\n\r\nBy the beginning of 1869 Frederic Harrison had drafted a comprehensive\r\nBill, embodying all the legislative proposals of his minority report.\r\nThis was introduced by Mundella and Hughes, and although its provisions\r\nwere received with denunciations by the employers,[411] it gained some\r\nsupport among the newly elected members, and was strongly backed up\r\noutside the House. The Liberal Government of that day, and nearly all\r\nthe members of the House of Commons, were still covertly hostile to\r\nthe very principles of Trade Unionism, and every attempt was made to\r\nburke the measure.[412] But the Junta were determined to make felt\r\ntheir new political power. From every part of the country pressure\r\nwas put upon members of Parliament. A great demonstration of workmen\r\nwas held at Exeter Hall, at which Mundella and Hughes declared their\r\nintention of forcing the House and the Ministry to vote upon the hated\r\nmeasure. Finding evasion no longer possible, the Government abandoned\r\nits attitude of hostility and agreed to a formal second reading, upon\r\nthe understanding that the Cabinet would next year bring in a Bill of\r\nits own. A provisional measure giving temporary protection to Trade\r\nUnion funds was accordingly hurried through Parliament at the end of\r\nthe session pending the introduction of a complete Bill.[413] The Junta\r\nhad gained the first victory of their political campaign.\r\n\r\nThe next session found the Government reluctant to fulfil its promise\r\nin the matter. But the Trade Unionists were not disposed to let the\r\nquestion sleep, and after much pressure Henry Bruce (afterwards Lord\r\nAberdare), who was then Home Secretary, produced, in 1871, a Bill which\r\nwas eagerly scanned by the Trade Union world. The Government proposed\r\nto concede all the points on which it had been specially pressed by the\r\nJunta. No Trade Union, however wide its objects, was henceforth to be\r\nillegal merely because it was “in restraint of trade.” Every Union was\r\nto be entitled to be registered, if its rules were not expressly in\r\ncontravention of the criminal law. And, finally, the registration which\r\ngave the Unions complete protection for their funds was so devised as\r\nto leave untouched their internal organisation and arrangements, and to\r\nprevent their being sued or proceeded against in a court of law.\r\n\r\nThe employers vehemently attacked the Government for conceding, as\r\nthey said, practically all the Trade Union demands.[414] But from the\r\nmen’s point of view this “complete charter legalising Unions” had a\r\nserious drawback. The Bill, as was complained, “while repealing the\r\nCombination Laws, substituted another penal law against workmen” as\r\nsuch. A lengthy clause provided that any violent threat or molestation\r\nfor the purpose of coercing either employers or employed should be\r\nseverely punished. All the terms of the old Combination Laws, “molest,”\r\n“obstruct,” “threaten,” “intimidate,” and so forth, were used without\r\nany definition or limitation, and picketing, moreover, was expressly\r\nincluded in molestation or obstruction by a comprehensive prohibition\r\nof “persistently following” any person, or “watching or besetting” the\r\npremises in which he was, or the approach to such premises. The Act\r\nof 1859, which had expressly legalised peaceful persuasion to join\r\nlegal combinations, was repealed.[415] It seemed only too probable\r\nthat the Government measure would make it a criminal offence for two\r\nTrade Unionists to stand quietly in the street opposite the works of\r\nan employer against whom they had struck, in order to communicate\r\npeacefully the fact of the strike to any workmen who might be ignorant\r\nof it.\r\n\r\nIt does not appear that Bruce’s fiercely resented “Third Clause”\r\nwas intended to effect any alteration in the law. Its comprehensive\r\nprohibition of violence, threats, intimidation, molestation, and\r\nobstruction did no more than sum up and codify the various judicial\r\ndecisions of past years under which the Trade Unionists had suffered.\r\nBut the law had hitherto been obscure and conflicting; both the\r\nstatutes and the judicial decisions had proceeded largely from a\r\npresumption against the very existence of Trade Unionism which was\r\nnow passing away; and the workmen and their advisers not unreasonably\r\nfeared the consequences of an explicit re-enactment of provisions which\r\npractically made criminal all the usual methods of trade combination. A\r\nrecent decision had brought the danger home to the minds of the Trade\r\nUnion leaders and their legal friends. In July 1867 a great strike had\r\nbroken out among the London tailors, in which the masters’ shops had\r\nbeen carefully “picketed.”[416] Druitt, Shorrocks, and other officers\r\nof the Union were thereupon indicted, not for personal violence or\r\nactual molestation, but for the vague crime of conspiracy. The Judge\r\n(Baron, afterwards Lord, Bramwell) held that pickets, if acting in\r\ncombination, were guilty of “molestation” if they gave annoyance only\r\nby black looks, or even by their presence in large numbers, without any\r\nacts or gestures of violence, and that if two or more persons combined\r\nto do anything unpleasant and annoying to another person they were\r\nguilty of a common law offence. The Tailors’ officers and committeemen\r\nwere found guilty merely of organising peaceful picketing, and it\r\nbecame evident that, if the elastic law of conspiracy could thus be\r\nbrought to bear on Trade Union disputes, practically every incident\r\nof strike management might become a crime.[417] Nor did Druitt’s case\r\nstand alone. Within the memory of the Junta men had been sent to prison\r\nfor the simple act of striking, or even for a simple agreement to\r\nstrike.[418] Indeed, merely giving notice of a projected strike, even\r\nin the most courteous and peaceful manner, had frequently been held\r\nto be an act of intimidation punishable as a crime.[419] In 1851 the\r\nposting up of placards announcing a strike was held to be intimidation\r\nof the employers.[420] The Government Bill, far from accepting Frederic\r\nHarrison’s proposed repeal of all criminal legislation specially\r\napplying to workmen, left these judicial decisions untouched, and,\r\nby re-enacting them in a codified form, proposed even to make their\r\noperation more uniform and effectual.\r\n\r\nThere was, accordingly, some ground for the assertion of the Trade\r\nUnionists that the Government was withdrawing with one hand what it was\r\ngiving with the other. It seemed of little use to declare the existence\r\nof trade societies to be legal if the criminal law was so stretched\r\nas to include the ordinary peaceful methods by which these societies\r\nattained their ends. Above all, the Trade Unionists angrily resented\r\nthe idea that any act should be made criminal if done by them, or in\r\nfurtherance of their Unions, that was not equally a crime if committed\r\nby any other person, or in pursuance of the objects of any other kind\r\nof association.\r\n\r\nA storm of indignation arose in the Trade Union world. The Junta sat\r\nin anxious consultation with their legal advisers, who all counselled\r\nthe utmost resistance to this most dangerous re-enactment of the law. A\r\ndelegate meeting of the London trades was summoned to protest against\r\nthe criminal clauses of Bruce’s Bill. But it was necessary to attack\r\nthe House of Commons from a wider area than the Metropolis. With this\r\nview the Junta determined to follow the example set by the Manchester\r\nand Birmingham Trades Councils in 1868 and 1869 by calling together a\r\nnational Trade Union Congress.[421]\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the Congress was fixed for March 1871, by which time\r\nit was rightly calculated that the obnoxious Bill would be actually\r\nunder discussion in the House of Commons. The delegates spent most of\r\ntheir time in denouncing the criminal clauses of the Bill, and came\r\nvery near to opposing the whole measure. But it was ultimately agreed\r\nto accept the legalising part of the Bill, whilst using every effort\r\nto throw out the Third Section. A deputation was sent to the Home\r\nSecretary. Protest after protest was despatched to the legislators, and\r\nthe Congress adjourned at half-past four each day, in order, as it was\r\nexpressly declared, that delegates might “devote the evening to waiting\r\nupon Members of Parliament.” But neither the Government nor the House\r\nof Commons was disposed to show any favour to Trade Union action in\r\nrestraint of that “free competition” and individual bargaining which\r\nhad so long been the creed of the employers. The utmost concession that\r\ncould be obtained was that the Bill should be divided into two, so\r\nthat the law legalising the existence of trade societies might stand\r\nby itself, whilst the criminal clauses restraining their action were\r\nembodied in a separate “Criminal Law Amendment Bill.” This illusory\r\nconcession sufficed to detach from the opposition many of those who had\r\nat the General Election professed friendship to the Unions. In the main\r\ndebate Thomas Hughes and A. J. Mundella stood almost alone in pressing\r\nthe Trade Unionists’ full demands; and though a few other members were\r\ninclined to help to some extent, the second reading was agreed to\r\nwithout a division. The other stages were rapidly run through without\r\nserious opposition. In the House of Lords the provisions against\r\npicketing were made even more stringent, “watching and besetting” by a\r\nsingle individual being made as criminal as “watching and besetting”\r\nby a multitude. In this unsatisfactory shape the two Bills passed\r\ninto law.[422] Trade Societies became, for the first time, legally\r\nrecognised and fully protected associations; whilst, on the other\r\nhand, the legislative prohibition of Trade Union action was expressly\r\nreaffirmed, and even increased in stringency.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of the Trade Unions this result amounted to a defeat; and\r\nthe conduct of the Government caused the bitterest resentment.[423]\r\nThe Secretaries of the Amalgamated Societies, especially Allan and\r\nApplegarth, had, indeed, attained the object which they personally had\r\nmost at heart. The great organisations for mutual succour, which had\r\nbeen built up by their patient sagacity, were now, for the first time,\r\nassured of complete legal protection. A number of the larger societies\r\npromptly availed themselves of the Trade Union Act, by registering\r\ntheir rules in accordance with its provisions;[424] and in September\r\n1871 the Conference of Amalgamated Trades “having,” as its final\r\nminutes declared, “discharged the duties for which it was organised,”\r\nformally dissolved itself.\r\n\r\nThe wider issue which remained to be fought required a more\r\nrepresentative organisation. In struggling for legal recognition\r\nthe Junta had, as we have seen, represented the more enlightened\r\nof the Trade Unionists rather than the whole movement. But, by the\r\nCriminal Law Amendment Act, the Government had deliberately struck\r\na blow against the methods of all trade societies at all periods.\r\nThe growing strength of the organisations of the coalminers and\r\ncotton-spinners, and the rapid expansion of Trade Unionism which marked\r\nthis period of commercial prosperity, had for some time been tending\r\ntowards the development of the informal meetings of the Junta into a\r\nmore representative executive. The dissolution of the Conference of\r\nAmalgamated Trades left the field open; and the leadership of the Trade\r\nUnion Movement was assumed by the Parliamentary Committee which had\r\nbeen appointed at the Trades Union Congress in the previous March, and\r\nwhich included all the principal leaders of the chief metropolitan and\r\nprovincial societies of the time.\r\n\r\nThe agitation which was immediately begun to secure the repeal of\r\nthe Criminal Law Amendment Act became during the next four years the\r\nmost significant feature of the Trade Union world. Throughout all\r\nthe various struggles of these years the Trade Union leaders kept\r\nsteadily in view the definite aim of getting rid of a law which they\r\nregarded, not only as hampering their efforts for better conditions\r\nof employment, but also as an indignity and an insult to the hundreds\r\nof thousands of intelligent artisans whom they represented. The\r\nwhole history of this agitation proves how completely the governing\r\nclasses were out of touch with the recently enfranchised artisans. The\r\nlegislation of 1871 was regarded by the Government and the House of\r\nCommons as the full and final solution of a long-standing problem. “The\r\njudges, however, declared,” as Henry Crompton points out, “that the\r\nonly effect of the legislation of 1871 was to make the trade object\r\nof the strike not illegal. A strike was perfectly legal; but if the\r\nmeans employed were calculated to coerce the employer they were illegal\r\nmeans, and a combination to do a legal act by illegal means was a\r\ncriminal conspiracy. In other words, a strike was lawful, but anything\r\ndone in pursuance of a strike was criminal. Thus the judges tore up the\r\nremedial statute, and each fresh decision went further and developed\r\nnew dangers.”[425] But Gladstone’s Cabinet steadfastly refused, right\r\ndown to its fall in 1874, even to consider the possibility of altering\r\nthe Criminal Law Amendment Act. It was in vain that deputation after\r\ndeputation pointed out that men were being sent to prison under this\r\nlaw for such acts as peacefully accosting a workman in the street.\r\nIn 1871 seven women were imprisoned in South Wales merely for saying\r\n“Bah” to one blackleg. Innumerable convictions took place for the\r\nuse of bad language. Almost any action taken by Trade Unionists to\r\ninduce a man not to accept employment at a struck shop resulted,\r\nunder the new Act, in imprisonment with hard labour. The intolerable\r\ninjustice of this state of things was made more glaring by the freedom\r\nallowed to the employers to make all possible use of “black-lists” and\r\n“character notes,” by which obnoxious men were prevented from getting\r\nwork. No prosecution ever took place for this form of molestation or\r\nobstruction. No employer was ever placed in the dock under the law\r\nwhich professedly applied to both parties. In short, boycotting by the\r\nemployers was freely permitted; boycotting by the men was put down by\r\nthe police.\r\n\r\nThe irritation caused by these petty prosecutions was, in December\r\n1872, deepened into anger by the sentence of twelve months’\r\nimprisonment passed upon the London gas-stokers. These men were found\r\nguilty of “conspiracy” to coerce or molest their employers by merely\r\npreparing for a simultaneous withdrawal of their labour. The vindictive\r\nsentence inflicted by Lord Justice Brett was justified by the governing\r\nclasses on the ground of the danger to the community which a strike of\r\ngas-stokers might involve; and the Home Secretary refused to listen\r\nto any appeal on behalf of the men.[426] The Trade Union leaders did\r\nnot fail to perceive that no legal distinction could, under the law as\r\nit then stood, be drawn between a gas-stoker and any other workmen.\r\nIf preparing for a strike was punishable, under “the elastic and\r\ninexplicable law of conspiracy,” by twelve months’ imprisonment, it was\r\nobvious that the whole fabric of Trade Unionism might be overthrown by\r\nany band of employers who chose to put the law in force. The London\r\nTrades Council accordingly summoned a delegate meeting “to consider\r\nthe critical legal position of all trade societies and their officers\r\nconsequent upon the recent conviction of the London gas-stokers.”\r\nRepresentation after representation was made to the Government and to\r\nmembers of Parliament; and the movement for the repeal of the Criminal\r\nLaw Amendment Act of 1871 was widened into a determined attempt to get\r\nrid of all penal legislation bearing on trade disputes.[427]\r\n\r\nRarely has political agitation been begun in such apparently\r\nunpromising circumstances, and carried so rapidly to a triumphant\r\nissue. The Liberal administration of these years, like the majority\r\nof both parties in the House of Commons, was entirely dominated by\r\nthe antagonism felt by the manufacturers to any effective collective\r\nbargaining on the part of the men. The representations of the\r\nParliamentary Committee found no sympathy either with Henry Bruce or\r\nwith Robert Lowe, who succeeded him as Home Secretary. Gladstone, as\r\nPrime Minister, refused in 1872 to admit that there was any necessity\r\nfor further legislation, and utterly declined to take the matter\r\nup;[428] and during that session the Parliamentary Committee were\r\nunable to find any member willing to introduce a Bill for the repeal of\r\nthe Criminal Law Amendment Act.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Union leaders, however, did not relax their efforts.\r\nAllan, Guile, Odger, and Howell were strongly reinforced by the\r\nrepresentatives of the miners, cotton-spinners, and ironworkers.\r\nAlexander Macdonald and John Kane, themselves men of remarkable\r\nability, had behind them thousands of sturdy politicians in all the\r\nindustrial centres. The agitation was fanned by the publication of\r\ndetails of the prosecutions under the new Act. Effective _Tracts for\r\nTrade Unionists_ were written by Henry Crompton and Frederic Harrison.\r\nCongresses at Nottingham in 1872, at Leeds in 1873, at Sheffield\r\nin 1874 kept up the fire, and passed judgment on those members of\r\nParliament who treated the Parliamentary Committee with contumely. As\r\nthe time of the General Election drew near, the pressure on the two\r\ngreat political parties was increased. Lists of questions to candidates\r\nwere prepared embodying the legislative claims of labour; and it was\r\nmade clear that no candidate would receive Trade Union support unless\r\nhis answers were satisfactory.\r\n\r\nIt will be a question for the historian of English politics whether\r\nthe unexpected rout of the Liberal party at the election of 1874 was\r\nnot due more to the active hostility of the Trade Unionists than to\r\nthe sullen abstention of the Nonconformists. The time happened to be a\r\nhigh-water mark of Trade Unionism. In these years of good trade every\r\nsociety had been rapidly increasing its membership. The miners, the\r\nagricultural labourers, and the textile operatives in particular had\r\nswarmed into organisation in a manner which recalls the rush of 1834.\r\nThe Trades Union Congress at Sheffield, held just before the General\r\nElection of 1874, claimed to represent over 1,100,000 organised\r\nworkmen, including a quarter of a million of coal-miners, as many\r\ncotton operatives, and a hundred thousand agricultural labourers.\r\nThe proceedings of this Congress reveal the feeling of bitter anger\r\nwhich had been created by the obtuseness to the claims of labour of\r\nthe Liberal leaders of that day. Not content with turning a deaf ear\r\nto all the representatives of the workmen, they had, with blundering\r\nignorance, retained as Secretary of the Liberal Association of the City\r\nof London the Sidney Smith who had, since 1851, been the principal\r\nofficer of the various associations of employers in the engineering and\r\niron trades.[429] As such he had proved himself a bitter and implacable\r\nenemy of Trade Unionism. We may imagine what would be the result to-day\r\nif either political party were to face a General Election with Mr.\r\nLaws, the organiser of the Shipping Federation, as its chief of the\r\nstaff. And whilst the Liberal party was treating the new electorate\r\nwith contumely, the Conservative candidates were listening blandly to\r\nthe workmen’s claims, and pledging themselves to repeal the obnoxious\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is not surprising that the old idea of\r\nTrade Union abstention from politics gave way to a determined attempt\r\nat organised political action. Nor were the Trade Unionists content\r\nwith merely pressing the organised political parties in the House of\r\nCommons. The running of independent Labour candidates against both\r\nparties alike was a most significant symptom of the new feeling in\r\nLabour politics. The Labour Representation League, composed mainly\r\nof prominent Trade Unionists, had for some years been endeavouring\r\nto secure the election of working men to the House of Commons; and\r\nthe independent candidatures of George Odger during 1869 and 1870 had\r\nprovoked considerable feeling.[430] At a bye-election at Greenwich\r\nin 1873, a third candidate was run with working-class support against\r\nboth the great parties, with the result that Boord, the Conservative,\r\ngained the seat. In what spirit this was regarded by the organised\r\nworkmen and their trusted advisers may be judged from the following\r\nleading article which Professor E. S. Beesly wrote for the _Beehive_,\r\nthen at the height of its influence: “The result of the Greenwich\r\nelection is highly satisfactory.... The workman has at length come to\r\nthe conclusion that the difference between Liberal and Tory is pretty\r\nmuch that between upper and nether millstone. The quality of the two is\r\nessentially the same. They are sections of the wealth-possessing class,\r\nand on all Parliamentary questions affecting the interests of labour\r\nthey play into one another’s hands so systematically and imperturbably\r\nthat one would suppose they thought workmen never read a newspaper or\r\nhear a speech.... The last hours of the Session were marked by the\r\nfailure of two Bills about which workmen cared infinitely more than\r\nabout all the measures put together for which Mr. Gladstone takes\r\ncredit since his accession to office--I mean Mr. Harcourt’s Conspiracy\r\nBill and Mr. Mundella’s Nine Hours Bill. As for Mr. Mundella’s Bill\r\nfor repealing the Criminal Law Amendment Act, it has never had a\r\nchance. For the failure of all these Bills the Ministry must be held\r\nresponsible....\r\n\r\n“This being the case, it is simply silly for Liberal newspapers to\r\nmourn over the Greenwich Election as an unfortunate mistake.... There\r\nwas no mistake at all at Greenwich. There was a ‘third party’ in the\r\nfield knowing perfectly well what it wanted, and regarding Mr. Boord\r\nand Mr. Angerstein with impartial hostility. I trust that such a third\r\nparty will appear in every large town in England at the next General\r\nElection, even though the result should be a Parliament of six hundred\r\nand fifty Boords. Everything must have a beginning, and workmen have\r\nwaited so long for justice that seven years of Tory government will\r\nseem a trifling addition to the sum total of their endurance if it is a\r\nnecessary preliminary to an enforcement of their claims.”[431]\r\n\r\nThe movement for direct electoral action remained without official\r\nsupport from Trade Unions as such until at the 1874 Congress Broadhurst\r\nwas able to report that the miners, ironworkers, and some other\r\nsocieties had actually voted money for Parliamentary candidatures.\r\nAt the General Election which ensued no fewer than thirteen “Labour\r\ncandidates” went to the poll. In most cases both Liberal and\r\nConservative candidates were run against them, with the result that\r\nthe Conservatives gained the seats.[432] But at Stafford and Morpeth\r\nthe official Liberals accepted what they were powerless to prevent;\r\nand Alexander Macdonald and Thomas Burt, the two leading officials of\r\nthe National Union of Miners, became the first “Labour members” of the\r\nHouse of Commons.\r\n\r\nIt is significant of the electioneering attitude of the Conservative\r\nleaders that, with the advent of the new Conservative Government,\r\nthe Trade Unionists appear to have assumed that the Criminal Law\r\nAmendment Act would be instantly repealed. Great was the disappointment\r\nwhen it was announced that a Royal Commission was to be appointed\r\nto inquire into the operation of the whole of the so-called “Labour\r\nLaws.” This was regarded as nothing more than a device for shelving\r\nthe question, and the Trade Union leaders refused either to become\r\nmembers of the Commission or to give evidence before it. Thomas Burt\r\nabsolutely refused a seat on the Commission. It needed the most\r\nspecific assurances by the Home Secretary that the Government really\r\nintended the earliest possible legislation to induce any working man\r\nto have anything to do with the Commission. Ultimately Alexander\r\nMacdonald, M.P., allowed himself to be persuaded to serve, together\r\nwith Tom Hughes; and George Shipton, the Secretary of the London Trades\r\nCouncil, Andrew Boa, the Secretary of the Glasgow Trades Council, and\r\na prominent Birmingham Trade Unionist gave evidence. The investigation\r\nof the Commission was perfunctory, and the report inconclusive. But\r\nthe Government were too fully alive to the new-found political power\r\nof the Unions to attempt to play with the question. At the beginning\r\nof 1875 the imprisonment of five cabinetmakers employed at Messrs.\r\nJackson & Graham, a well-known London firm, roused considerable\r\npublic feeling, and led to many questions in Parliament.[433] In\r\nJune the Home Secretary, in an appreciative and conciliatory speech,\r\nintroduced two Bills for altering respectively the civil and criminal\r\nlaw. As amended in Committee by the efforts of Mundella and others,\r\nthese measures resulted in Acts which completely satisfied the Trade\r\nUnion demands. The Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1871 was formally\r\nand unconditionally repealed. By the Conspiracy and Protection of\r\nProperty Act (38 and 39 Vic. c. 86), definite and reasonable limits\r\nwere set to the application of the law of conspiracy to trade disputes.\r\nThe Master and Servant Act of 1867 was replaced by an Employers and\r\nWorkmen Act (38 and 39 Vic. c. 90), a change of nomenclature which\r\nexpressed a fundamental revolution in the law. Henceforth master and\r\nservant became, as employer and employee, two equal parties to a civil\r\ncontract. Imprisonment for breach of engagement was abolished. The\r\nlegalisation of Trade Unions was completed by the legal recognition\r\nof their methods. Peaceful picketing was expressly permitted. The old\r\nwords “coerce” and “molest,” which had, in the hands of prejudiced\r\nmagistrates, proved such instruments of oppression, were omitted from\r\nthe new law, and violence and intimidation were dealt with as part of\r\nthe general criminal code. No act committed by a group of workmen was\r\nhenceforth to be punishable unless the same act by an individual was\r\nitself a criminal offence. Collective bargaining, in short, with all\r\nits necessary accompaniments, was, after fifty years of legislative\r\nstruggle, finally recognised by the law of the land.[434]\r\n\r\nThe paramount importance of the legal and Parliamentary struggle\r\nfrom 1867 to 1875 has compelled us to relegate to the next chapter\r\nall mention of striking contemporary events in Trade Union history.\r\nThe sustained efforts of this decade, too often ignored by a younger\r\ngeneration of Trade Unionists, are even now referred to by the\r\nsurvivors as constituting the finest period of Trade Union activity.\r\nFor over eight years the Unions had been subjected to the strain of a\r\nprolonged and acute crisis, during which their very existence was at\r\nstake. Out of this crisis they emerged, as we have seen, triumphantly\r\nsuccessful, “liberated,” to use George Howell’s words, “from the last\r\nvestige of the criminal laws specially appertaining to labour.”[435]\r\n\r\nThis tangible victory was not the only result of the struggle. In order\r\nto gain their immediate end the Trade Union leaders had adopted the\r\narguments of their opponents, and had been led to take up a position\r\nwhich, whilst it departed from the Trade Union traditions of the past,\r\nproved in the future a serious impediment to their further theoretic\r\nprogress. To understand the intellectual attitude of the Junta and\r\ntheir friends, we must consider in some detail the position which they\r\nhad to attack. From the very beginning of the century the employers\r\nhad persistently asserted their right to make any kind of bargain with\r\nthe individual workman, irrespective of its effect on the Standard of\r\nLife. They had, accordingly, adopted the principle, as against both\r\nthe Trade Unionists and the Factory Act philanthropists, of perfect\r\nfreedom of contract and complete competition between both workers and\r\nemployers. In order to secure absolute freedom of competition between\r\nindividuals it was necessary to penalise any attempt on the part of the\r\nworkmen to regulate, by combination, the conditions of the bargain.\r\nBut this involved, in reality, a departure from the principle of legal\r\nfreedom of contract. One form of contract, that of the collective\r\nbargain, was, in effect, made a criminal offence, on the plea that,\r\nhowever beneficial it might seem to the workmen, it cut at the root of\r\nnational prosperity. It will be obvious that in urging this contention\r\nthe employers were taking up an inconsistent position. Their pecuniary\r\ninterest in complete competition outweighed, in fact, their faith in\r\nfreedom of contract.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the astute workmen who led the movement were gradually\r\nconcentrating their forces upon the only position from which they\r\ncould hope to be victorious. They had, it must be remembered, no means\r\nof imposing their own view upon the community. Even after 1867 their\r\nfollowers formed but a small minority of the electorate, whilst the\r\nwhole machinery of politics was in the hands of the middle class.\r\nPowerless to coerce or even to intimidate the governing classes, they\r\ncould win only by persuasion. It was, however, hopeless to dream\r\nof converting the middle class to the essential principle of Trade\r\nUnionism, the compulsory maintenance of the Standard of Life. In the\r\nthen state of Political Economy the Trade Unionists saw against them,\r\non this point, the whole mass of educated opinion in the country.\r\nJohn Bright, for instance, did but express the common view of the\r\nprogressive party of that time when he solemnly assured the working man\r\nthat “combinations, in the long run, must be as injurious to himself as\r\nto the employer against whom he is contending.”[436] Lord Shaftesbury,\r\nthe lifelong advocate of factory legislation, was praying that “the\r\nworking people may be emancipated from the tightest thraldom they have\r\never yet endured. All the single despots, and all the aristocracies\r\nthat ever were or ever will be, are as puffs of wind compared with\r\nthese tornadoes, the Trade Unions.”[437] The Sheffield and other\r\noutrages, the rumours of constant persecution of non-Unionists, the\r\nhand-workers’ perpetual objection to machinery, the restrictions on\r\npiecework and apprenticeship--all these real and fancied crimes had\r\ncreated a mass of prejudice against which it was hopeless for the Trade\r\nUnionists to struggle.\r\n\r\nThe Union leaders, therefore, wisely left this part of their case\r\nin the background. They avoided arguing whether Trade Unionism was,\r\nin principle, useful or detrimental, right or wrong. They insisted\r\nonly on the right of every Englishman to bargain for the sale of his\r\nlabour in the manner he thought most conducive to his own interests.\r\nWhat they demanded was perfect freedom for a workman to substitute\r\ncollective for individual bargaining, if he imagined such a course to\r\nbe for his own advantage. Freedom of association in matters of contract\r\nbecame, therefore, their rejoinder to the employers’ cry of freedom of\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nIt is clear that the Trade Unionists had the best of the argument.\r\nIt was manifestly unreasonable for the employers to insist on the\r\nprinciple of non-interference of the State in industry whenever they\r\nwere pushed by the advocates of factory legislation, and at the same\r\ntime to clamour for the assistance of the police to put down peaceful\r\nand voluntary combinations of their workmen. The capitalists were, in\r\nshort, committed to the principle of _laissez-faire_ in every phase\r\nof industrial life, from “Free Trade in Corn” to the unlimited use of\r\nlabour of either sex at any age and under any conditions; and what the\r\nworkmen demanded was only the application of this principle to the wage\r\ncontract. “The Trade Union question,” writes, in 1869, their chosen\r\nrepresentative and most powerful advocate, “is another and the latest\r\nexample of the truth, that the sphere of legislation is strictly and\r\ncuriously limited. After legislating about labour for centuries, each\r\nchange producing its own evils, we have slowly come to see the truth,\r\nthat we must cease to legislate for it at all. The public mind has been\r\nof late conscious of serious embarrassment, and eagerly expecting some\r\nlegislative solution, some heaven-born discoverer to arise, with a new\r\nParliamentary nostrum. As usual in such cases, it now turns out that\r\nthere is no legislative solution at all; and that the true solution\r\nrequires, as its condition, the removal of the mischievous meddling\r\nof the past.”[438] This doctrine “that all men may lawfully agree to\r\nwork or not to work, to employ or not to employ, on any terms that\r\nthey think fit,” forms the whole burden of the speeches and petitions\r\nof the Trade Union leaders throughout this controversy. “We do not,”\r\nsay the official representatives of Trade Unionism in their memorial\r\nto the Home Secretary in April 1875, “seek to interfere with the free\r\ncompetition of the individual in the exercise of his craft in his own\r\nway; but we reserve to ourselves the right either to work for, or to\r\nrefuse to work for, an employer according to the circumstances of the\r\ncase, just as the master has the right to discharge a workman, or\r\nworkmen; and we deny that the individual right is in any way interfered\r\nwith when it is done in concert.”\r\n\r\nThe working men had, in fact, picked up the weapon of their opponents\r\nand left these without defence. But in so doing the leading Trade\r\nUnionists of the time drifted into a position no less inconsistent than\r\nthat of the employers. When they contended that the Union should be as\r\nfree to bargain as the individual, they had not the slightest intention\r\nof permitting the individual to bargain freely if they could prevent\r\nhim. Though Allan and Applegarth were able conscientiously to inform\r\nthe Royal Commission that the members of their societies did not refuse\r\nto work with non-society men, they must have been perfectly aware\r\nthat this convenient fact was only true in those places and at those\r\nperiods in which society men were not in a sufficiently large majority\r\nto do otherwise. The trades to which Henry Broadhurst and George\r\nHowell belonged were notorious for the success with which the Unions\r\nhad maintained their practice of excluding non-society men from their\r\njobs. The coal-miners of Northumberland and Durham habitually refused\r\nto descend the shaft in company with a non-Unionist.[439]\r\n\r\nWe have shown, in our _Industrial Democracy_, that this universal\r\naspiration of Trade Unionism--the enforcement of membership--stands,\r\nin our opinion, on the same footing as the enforcement of citizenship.\r\nBut, however this may be, it is evident that the refusal of the\r\nNorthumberland miners to “ride” with non-society men is, in effect,\r\nas coercive on the dissentient minority as the Mines Regulation Act\r\nor an Eight Hours Bill. The insistence upon the Englishman’s right\r\nto freedom of contract was, in fact, in the mouths of staunch Trade\r\nUnionists, perilously near cant; and we find Frederic Harrison himself,\r\nwhen dealing with other legislation, warning them that it would be\r\nsuicidal for working men to adopt as their own the capitalist cry of\r\n“non-interference.”[440] The force of this caution must have been\r\nevident to the Junta, who had had too much experience of the workings\r\nof modern industry not to realise the need for a compulsory maintenance\r\nof the Standard of Life. No Trade Unionist can deny that, without some\r\nmethod of enforcing the decision of the majority, effective trade\r\ncombination is impossible.\r\n\r\nIt must not be inferred from the above criticism of the theoretic\r\nposition taken by the men who steered the Trade Union Movement through\r\nits great crisis that they were conscious of their inconsistency with\r\nregard to State intervention, or that they deliberately set to work to\r\nwin their case upon false premises. No one can study the history of\r\ntheir leadership without being impressed by their devotion, sagacity,\r\nand high personal worth. We must regard their inconsistency as a\r\nstriking instance of the danger which besets a party formed without any\r\nclear idea of the social state at which it is aiming. In the struggle\r\nof these years we watch the English Trade Unionists driven from their\r\nUtopian aspirations into an inconsistent opportunism, from which they\r\ndrifted during the next generation into the crude “self-help” of\r\nan “aristocracy of labour.” During the whole of this process there\r\nwas no moment at which the incompatibility of their Individualist\r\nand Collectivist views was perceived. Applegarth and Odger, for\r\ninstance, saw no inconsistency in becoming leading officials of the\r\n“International” on a programme drafted by Karl Marx, and at the same\r\ntime supporting the current Radical demand for a widespread peasant\r\nproprietorship. But it was inevitable that the exclusive insistence\r\nupon the Individualist arguments, through which alone the victory of\r\n1875 could be won, should impress the Individualist ideal upon the\r\nminds of those who stood round the leaders. Other influences, moreover,\r\npromoted the acceptance by the Trade Unionists of the economic\r\nshibboleths of the middle class. The failure of the crude experiments\r\nof Owen and O’Connor, the striking success of the policy of Free Trade,\r\nthe growing participation of working men in the Liberal politics of the\r\ntime, and, above all, the close intimacy which many of them enjoyed\r\nwith able and fertile thinkers of the middle class, all tended to\r\ncreate a new school of Trade Unionists. In a subsequent chapter we\r\nshall describe the results of this intellectual conversion upon the\r\nTrade Union Movement. First, however, we must turn to the internal\r\ndevelopment of these years, which our description of the Parliamentary\r\nstruggles of 1867-75 has forced us temporarily to ignore.[441]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[373] William Allan was born of Scotch parents at Carrickfergus,\r\nUlster, in 1813. His father, who was manager of a cotton-spinning mill,\r\nremoved to a mill near Glasgow, and William became in 1825 a piecer in\r\na cotton factory at Gateside. Three years later he left the mill to be\r\nbound apprentice to Messrs. Holdsworth, a large engineering firm at\r\nAnderston, Glasgow. At the age of nineteen, before his apprenticeship\r\nwas completed, he married the niece of one of the partners. In 1835 he\r\nwent to work as a journeyman engineer at Liverpool, moving thence, with\r\nthe railway works, to their new centre at Crewe, where he joined his\r\nUnion. On the imprisonment of Selsby, in 1847, he became its general\r\nsecretary, retaining this office when, in 1851, the society became\r\nmerged in the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. For over twenty years\r\nhe was annually re-elected secretary of this vast organisation, dying\r\nat last in office in 1874.\r\n\r\n[374] The celebrated “International Association of Working Men,” which\r\nloomed so large in the eyes of Governments and the governing classes\r\nabout 1869-70, had arisen out of the visit of two French delegates to\r\nLondon in 1863, to concert joint action on behalf of Poland. It was\r\nformally established at a meeting in London on September 28, 1864, at\r\nwhich an address prepared by Karl Marx was read. Its fundamental aim\r\nwas the union of working men of all countries for the emancipation of\r\nlabour; and its principles went on to declare that “the subjection\r\nof the man of labour to the man of capital lies at the bottom of all\r\nservitude, all social misery, and all political dependence.” Between\r\n1864 and 1870, branches were established in nearly all European\r\ncountries, as well as in the United States, the majority of trade\r\nsocieties in some European countries joining in a body. The central\r\nadministration was entrusted to a General Council of fifty-five\r\nmembers sitting in London, which was composed of London residents of\r\nvarious nationalities, elected by the branches in the countries to\r\nwhich they belonged. The General Council had, however, no legislative\r\nor other control over the branches, and in practice served as little\r\nmore than a means of communication between them, each country managing\r\nits own affairs in its own way. The principles and programme of the\r\nAssociation underwent a steady development in the succession of annual\r\ninternational congresses attended by delegates from the various\r\nbranches. The extent to which English working men really participated\r\nin its fundamental objects is not clear. In 1870 Odger was president\r\nand Applegarth chairman of the General Council, which included Benjamin\r\nLucraft, afterwards a member of the London School Board, and other\r\nwell-known working-men politicians. But few English Trade Unions (among\r\nthem being the Bootmakers and Curriers) joined in their corporate\r\ncapacity; and when, in October 1866, the General Council invited the\r\nLondon Trades Council to join, or, that failing, to give permission\r\nfor a representative of the International to attend its meetings, with\r\na view of promptly reporting all Continental strikes, the Council’s\r\nminutes show that both requests were refused. The London Trades Council\r\ndeclined indeed to recognise the International even as the authorised\r\nmedium of communication with trade societies abroad, and decided to\r\ncommunicate with these directly. Applegarth attended several of the\r\nContinental congresses as a delegate from England, and elaborately\r\nexplained the aims and principles of the Association in an interview\r\npublished in the _New York World_ of May 21 1870. After the suppression\r\nof the Commune the branches in France were crushed out of existence;\r\nand the membership in England and other countries fell away. The annual\r\nCongress held in 1872 at The Hague decided to transfer the General\r\nCouncil to New York, and the “International” ceased to play any part\r\nin the English Labour Movement. An interesting account of its Trade\r\nUnionist action appeared in the _Fortnightly Review_ for November 1870,\r\nby Professor E. S. Beesly.\r\n\r\n[375] Robert Applegarth, the son of a quartermaster in the Royal Navy,\r\nwas born at Hull on January 23, 1833. At the age of eleven he went to\r\nwork as errand boy, eventually drifting into the shop of a joiner and\r\ncabinetmaker, where, unapprenticed, he picked up the trade as best he\r\ncould. In 1852 he moved to Sheffield; but in 1855, on the death of his\r\nparents, he emigrated to the United States, returning to Sheffield\r\nin the following year, as the health of his wife did not allow her\r\nto follow him to the land of promise. Joining the local Carpenters’\r\nUnion, he quickly became its most prominent member, and brought it\r\nover in a body when the formation in 1861 of the Amalgamated Society\r\nof Carpenters and Joiners offered a prospect of more efficient trade\r\naction. Elected general secretary in 1862, he retained the office\r\nuntil 1871, when, in consequence of various personal disputes in the\r\nsociety, he voluntarily resigned. In 1870, on the formation of the\r\nLondon School Board, he stood as a candidate for the Lambeth division,\r\nbut was unsuccessful, though he received 7600 votes. In the same year\r\nhe was invited to become a candidate for Parliament for the borough of\r\nMaidstone, but he retired in favour of Sir John Lubbock. In 1871 he was\r\nappointed a member of the Royal Commission on the Contagious Diseases\r\nAct. On resigning his secretaryship he turned for a time to journalism,\r\nand acted as war correspondent in France for an American newspaper.\r\nShortly afterwards he became foreman to a firm of manufacturers of\r\nengineering and diving apparatus, eventually becoming the proprietor\r\nof this flourishing business and retiring with a small competence.\r\nMr. Applegarth, who is (1920) the sole survivor of the “Junta” of\r\n1867-71, still retains his membership of the Amalgamated Society of\r\nCarpenters and his interest in Trade Unionism, about which he has\r\ngiven us valuable documents and reminiscences. See _The Life of Robert\r\nApplegarth_, by A. W. Humphrey, 1915.\r\n\r\n[376] Daniel Guile was born at Liverpool, October 21, 1814, the son of\r\na shoemaker. Bound apprentice to an ironfounder in 1827, he joined the\r\nUnion in June 1834. In 1863 he became its corresponding secretary, a\r\nposition he retained until his retirement at the end of 1881. He was\r\na member of the Parliamentary Committee, 1871-5, and died December 7,\r\n1883.\r\n\r\nGeorge Odger, the son of a Cornish miner, was born in 1820, at\r\nRouborough, near Tavistock, South Devon, and became a shoemaker at\r\nan early age. Tramping about the country, as was then customary, he\r\neventually settled in London, becoming a prominent member of the\r\nLadies’ Shoemakers’ Society. His first important public action was\r\nin connection with the meetings of delegates of London trades on the\r\nbuilding trades lock-out in 1859. On the formation of the London\r\nTrades Council in 1860 he became one of its leading members, and from\r\n1862 until the reconstruction of the Council in 1872 he acted as its\r\nsecretary. As one of the leaders of London working-class Radicalism he\r\nmade five attempts to get into Parliament, but was each time baulked by\r\nthe opposition of the official Liberal party. At Chelsea in 1868, at\r\nStratford in 1869, and at Bristol in 1870 he retired rather than split\r\nthe vote, but at Southwark in 1870 he went to the poll, and failed of\r\nsuccess only by 304 votes, the official Liberal, Sir Sidney Waterlow,\r\nbeing at the bottom with 2966 votes as against 4382 given for Odger. At\r\nthe General Election of 1874 he again stood, to be once more opposed\r\nby both Liberals and Conservatives with the same result as before. He\r\ndied in 1877, his funeral, which was attended by Professor E. Beesly,\r\nProfessor Fawcett, and Sir Charles Dilke, being made the occasion of a\r\nremarkable demonstration by the London working men. An eulogy of him\r\nby Professor Beesly appeared in the _Weekly Despatch_, March 11, 1877.\r\nA brief biographical sketch was published under the title of _The Life\r\nand Labour of George Odger_, 1877.\r\n\r\n[377] John Kane was born at Alnwick, Northumberland, in 1819. Sent\r\nto work at seven, he served in various capacities until the age of\r\nfifteen, when he moved to Newcastle-on-Tyne, and entered the ironworks\r\nof Messrs. Hawke at Gateshead. Here he took part in the Chartist and\r\nother progressive movements, making a vain attempt in 1842 to form a\r\nUnion in his trade. Not until 1863 was a durable society established,\r\nand when in 1868 the Amalgamated Ironworkers’ Association was formed\r\non a national basis, John Kane became general secretary, a position he\r\nretained until his death in March 1876.\r\n\r\n[378] The first permanent committee of the nature of a Trades Council\r\nappears to have been, according to our information, the Liverpool\r\n“Trades Guardian Association,” which was established in 1848 with the\r\nobject of protecting Trade Unions from suppression by the employers’\r\nuse of the criminal law. From its printed report and balance sheet\r\nfor 1848, and the references in the _Fortnightly Circular_ of the\r\nStonemasons’ Society for November 23, 1848, we gather that it took\r\nvigorous action to protect the Sheffield razor-grinders from malicious\r\nprosecution, and to help the Liverpool masons who had been indicted\r\nfor conspiracy. Of its activity from 1850 to 1857 we possess no\r\nrecords, but in August 1857 it subscribed £400 in aid of the Liverpool\r\ncabinetmakers, and in 1861 it was assisting the London bricklayers’\r\nstrike. In July of that year it was merged in a “United Trades\r\nProtection Association,” formed upon the model of the newly established\r\nLondon Trades Council. In Glasgow there appears to have been, since\r\n1825, an almost continuous series of joint committees of delegates for\r\nparticular purposes. An attempt was made in 1851 to place these on a\r\npermanent footing, but the trades soon ceased to send delegates. A\r\nrenewed attempt in 1858, made at the instance of Alexander Campbell,\r\nmet with greater success; and the Council then established, composed\r\nprincipally of the building trades, was in 1860 enjoying a vigorous\r\nlife. Sheffield, too, had long had ephemeral federations of the local\r\ntrades, which came near having a continuous existence. One of these,\r\nthe “Association of Organised Trades,” established in 1857 with the\r\nspecial object of assisting the Sheffield Typographical Society in\r\ndefending a libel action, became the permanent Trades Council. Other\r\ntowns, such as Dublin and Bristol, had almost constantly some kind of\r\nCouncil of the local trades. An appeal of the Trade Defence Association\r\nof Manchester, signed by representatives of nine thousand operatives on\r\nbehalf of the dyers’ strike, occurs in the _Stonemasons’ Fortnightly\r\nCircular_ for 1854. In London, as may be gathered from George Odger’s\r\nevidence before the Master and Servant Law Committee in 1867, the\r\nmeetings of “Metropolitan Trades Delegates” had been particularly\r\nfrequent since 1848. In 1852, for instance, as we discover from the\r\n_Bookbinders’ Trade Circular_ (November 1853), a committee of the\r\nLondon trades took the case of the Wolverhampton tinplate workers out\r\nof the hands of the somewhat decrepit National Association of United\r\nTrades, and bore the whole cost of these expensive legal proceedings.\r\nNo sooner had the task of this committee been completed, when another\r\ncommitted was formed to assist the strike of the Preston cotton\r\noperatives. It was to this committee, sitting at the Bell Inn, Old\r\nBailey, the historic meeting-place of London Trade Unionism, that Lloyd\r\nJones, in March 1855, communicated his fears that a certain Friendly\r\nSocieties’ Bill, then before the House of Commons, would make the legal\r\nposition of trade societies even more equivocal than it then was. A\r\n“Metropolitan Trades Committee on the Friendly Societies’ Bill” was\r\naccordingly formed, the printed report of which is reviewed by Dunning\r\nin his _Circular_ for December 1855. From this we learn that it was\r\npresided over by William Allan, and that it included his old friend\r\nWilliam Newton, as well as the general secretaries of the Stonemasons’\r\nand Bricklayers’ Societies, and representatives of the Compositors and\r\nBookbinders. It was supported by eighty-seven different Trade Unions\r\nwith forty-eight thousand members, who contributed a halfpenny per\r\nmember to cover the expenses. Its Parliamentary action seems, to have\r\nbeen vigorous and effective. The objectionable clauses were, by skilful\r\nParliamentary lobbying, dropped out of the Bill, and what seemed at the\r\ntime to be an important step towards the legislation of trade societies\r\nwas, through the help of Thomas Hughes and Lord Goderich, secured.\r\nBetween 1858 and 1867 Trades Councils were established in about a\r\ndozen of the largest towns. The Trade Union expansion of 1870-73 saw\r\ntheir number doubled. But their great increase was one of the effects\r\nof the great wave of Trade Union organisation which swept over the\r\ncountry in 1889-91, when over sixty new councils were established, and\r\nthose already in existence were reorganised and greatly increased in\r\nmembership.\r\n\r\n[379] Second Annual Report of London Trades Council, March 31, 1862.\r\n\r\n[380] No copy is preserved in the British Museum nor among the archives\r\nof the Trades Council itself. Mr. Robert Applegarth kindly presented us\r\nwith a copy, which is now in the British Library of Political Science\r\nat the London School of Economics. The only other one known to us is in\r\nthe Goldsmiths’ Library at the University of London.\r\n\r\n[381] On receipt of a memorial from the operatives asking for the\r\nintroduction of the Nine Hours Day, three of the principal London\r\nbuilders gave notice that henceforth they would engage their workmen,\r\nnot by the day, but by the hour. “This arrangement,” they added, “of\r\npayment by the hour will enable any workman employed by us to work any\r\nnumber of hours he may think proper.” This specious proposal involved\r\na total abandonment of the principle of Collective Bargaining. What\r\nthe master builders proposed was, in effect, to do away with the\r\nvery conception of a normal day, and to revert, as far as the hours\r\nwere concerned, to separate contracts with each individual workman.\r\nThe workmen realised, what they failed clearly to explain, that\r\nthe proffered freedom was illusory. In the modern organisation of\r\nindustry on a large scale there can be no freedom for the individual\r\nworkman to drop his tools at whatever moment he chooses. Without a\r\nconcerted normal day, each workman must inevitably find his task\r\ncontinue as long as the engines are going or the works are open. The\r\nreal question at issue was how the common hours of labour should be\r\nfixed. The master builders of 1861 rightly calculated that if each\r\nman was really free to earn as many hours’ wages in the day as they\r\nchose to offer him, the hours during which the whole body would work\r\nwould, in effect, be governed, not by the general convenience, but\r\nby the desire and capacity of those willing to work the longest day.\r\nOn this, the essential issue, the men maintained their position. The\r\nnormal day in the London building trades was tacitly fixed according\r\nto the prevailing custom, and has since been repeatedly regulated and\r\nreduced by formal collective agreement until the average working week\r\nthroughout the year consists of less than 48 hours. The minor point of\r\nthe unit of remuneration was gradually conceded by the men, and the\r\nHour System, guarded by strict limitation of the working day, has come\r\nto be preferred by both parties.\r\n\r\n[382] The letters were drawn up by Frederic Harrison and Godfrey\r\nLushington, after personal investigation and inquiry, and were signed\r\nalso by T. Hughes, J. M. Ludlow, E. S. Beesly, R. H. Hutton, R. B\r\nLitchfield, and T. R. Bennett. They appeared in July 1861.\r\n\r\n[383] Many of the local Birmingham Trade Unions became directly\r\naffiliated to the National Reform League. But with the exception of two\r\nsmall clubs at Wolverhampton, and the West End Cabinetmakers (London),\r\nno other Trade Union appears to have joined the League in a corporate\r\ncapacity, though its Council included Allan, Applegarth, Coulson,\r\nCremer, Odger, Potter, and Conolly.\r\n\r\n[384] The obligation to proceed by warrant was at first universal, as\r\nthe Act of 1824, 4 Geo. IV. c. 34, gave the magistrate no discretion.\r\nBy that act the master was to be served with a summons at the instance\r\nof the workman, whilst the workman was to be arrested on a warrant on\r\nthe complaint upon oath of the master. But, in 1848, Jervis’s Act, 11 &\r\n12 Vic. c. 43, gave justices power in all cases to issue a summons in\r\nthe first instance. The practice was accordingly gradually introduced\r\nin England of summoning the workman; and the issue of a warrant was in\r\ngeneral confined to cases in which the workman had gone away, or had\r\nfailed to appear to a summons. Jervis’s Act, however, did not apply\r\nto Scotland, so that summary arrests of workmen on warrants continued\r\nuntil 1867; and this was one of the principal grievances adduced by the\r\nGlasgow representatives. Even in England warrants were occasionally\r\ngranted by vindictive magistrates. In 1863 a dispute took place at a\r\nDurham colliery, and the employer proceeded against the miners under\r\nthe Master and Servant Law. “In the middle of the next night twelve of\r\nthem were taken out of their beds by the police and lodged in Durham\r\nlock-up, on the charge of deserting their work without notice” (Letter\r\nby Professor E. S. Beesly in _Spectator_, December 12, 1863).\r\n\r\n[385] See Question 864, Master and Servant Law Select Committee, 1866;\r\nUnwin _v._ Clarke, 1 Law Reports, Queen’s Bench, p. 417; and Second\r\nReport of Labour Laws Commission, c. 1157 (1875), p. 7.\r\n\r\nThe enactments rendering the workman liable to imprisonment for simple\r\nbreach of a contract of service are historically to be traced to the\r\nperiod when the law denied to the labourer the right to withhold his\r\nservice or to bargain as to his wages. Any neglect or abandonment\r\nof his work was, therefore, like a simple refusal to work at all, a\r\nbreach, not so much of contract, as of a duty arising out of status\r\nand enforced by statute. The law on the subject dates, indeed, back to\r\nthe celebrated Statute of Labourers of 1349 (23 Ed. III.), the primary\r\nobject of which was to enforce service at the rates of hiring that\r\nexisted prior to the Black Death. The second section of this law enacts\r\nthat if a workman or servant depart from service before the time agreed\r\nupon he shall be imprisoned. The same principle was asserted in the\r\nStatute of Apprentices in 1563 (5 Eliz. c. 4), which consolidated the\r\nlaw relating to all artificers and labourers, and expressly applied it\r\nto workers by the piece, who were rendered liable to imprisonment if\r\nthey left before completing their job. During the eighteenth century,\r\nwhich abounded, as we have seen, in enactments dealing with particular\r\ntrades, a long series of statutes made the provisions of law more\r\ndefinite and stringent in the industries in question. The principal\r\nEnglish Acts were 7 Geo. I. st. 1, c. 13 (tailors); 9 Geo. I. c. 27\r\n(shoemakers); 13 Geo. II. c. 8 (all leather trades); 20 Geo. II. c. 19;\r\n27 Geo. II. c. 6; 31 Geo. II. c. 11 (various trades); 6 Geo. III. c. 25\r\n(agreements for a term); 17 Geo. III. c. 56 (textiles, etc.); 39 & 40\r\nGeo. III. c. 77 (coal and iron); 4 Geo. IV. c. 34 (all trades); 10 Geo.\r\nIV. c. 52 (general); 6 & 7 Vic. c. 40 (textiles).\r\n\r\nThe intolerable oppression which these laws enabled unscrupulous\r\nemployers to commit was, at the beginning of the century, scarcely\r\ninferior to that brought about by the Combination Laws. This was\r\nstrongly urged by the authors of _A few Remarks on the State of the\r\nLaws at present in existence for regulating Masters and Workpeople_\r\n(preserved among the Place MSS. 27804), which George White, the\r\nprompter of Peter Moore, M.P., published in 1823. The pieceworker\r\nclause of the Statute of Apprentices was particularly oppressive. “This\r\nclause,” says White, “has been much abused, as in many businesses\r\nthey never finish their work, as the nature of the employment is such\r\nthat they are compelled to begin one before they finish another, as\r\nwheelwrights, japanners, and an infinite number of trades; therefore\r\nif any dispute ariseth respecting the amount of wages, and a strike\r\nor turn-out commences, or men leave their work, having words, the\r\nmaster prosecutes them for leaving their work unfinished. Very few\r\nprosecutions have been made to effect under the Combination Acts, but\r\nhundreds have been made under this law, and the labourer or workman\r\ncan never be free, unless this law is modified. The Combination Act\r\nis nothing: it is the law which regards the finishing of work which\r\nmasters employ to harass and keep down the wages of their workpeople;\r\nunless this is modified nothing is done, and by repealing the\r\nCombination Acts you leave the workman in ninety-nine cases out of a\r\nhundred in the same state you found him--at the mercy of his master”\r\n(p. 51). But, in spite of this somewhat exaggerated protest, neither\r\nPlace nor Hume took up the amendment of the law relating to contracts\r\nof service. Their paramount concern was to secure for the workman\r\nfreedom to enter into a contract, and oppressive punishment for its\r\nbreach attracted, for the moment, little attention.\r\n\r\nBesides White’s Manual, the following may be referred to for the\r\nhistory of the law, and of its amendment: _Report of Conference on the\r\nLaw of Master and Workman under the Contract of Service_ (Glasgow,\r\n1864); the Reports of the Select Committee on the Law of Master and\r\nServant, 1866, and of the Royal Commission on the Labour Laws, 1875;\r\n_The Labour Laws_, by James Edward Davis (1875); and Stephen’s _History\r\nof the Criminal Law_, vol. iii.\r\n\r\n[386] Alexander Campbell, who had been a prominent disciple of Robert\r\nOwen, and whom we have already seen as secretary to the little\r\nGlasgow Carpenters’ Union of 1834, was, in 1863, editing the _Glasgow\r\nSentinel_, which became the chief organ of Macdonald and his National\r\nAssociation of Miners. Campbell is described as having been, in 1858,\r\nthe virtual founder of the Glasgow Trades Council.\r\n\r\n[387] The Memorial, which contains an exact statement of the law and\r\nsuggestions for its amendment, is preserved in the _Flint Glass Makers’\r\nMagazine_, December 1863.\r\n\r\n[388] Among those present were Robert Applegarth, George Odger, Daniel\r\nGuile, T. J. Dunning, Alexander Macdonald, William Dronfield, Alexander\r\nCampbell, Edwin Coulson, and George Potter.

The popular middle-class sentiment is reflected in Charles Reade’s\r\nnovel, _Put Yourself in his Place_ (1871).\r\n\r\n[395] See, for instance, the speech of George Newton, the secretary\r\nof the Glasgow Trades Committee: “A great many strikes, and perhaps\r\nlock-outs, too, have arisen from a stubborn refusal on the part of\r\nboth sides to look the question honestly and fairly in the face....\r\nLet us examine ourselves and see if there be any wicked way in us that\r\ncontributes to this unsatisfactory state of things, and if we discover\r\nthat we are not blameless, then we ought, first of all, to set our own\r\nhouse in order.... Then let us examine the opposite side of the camp\r\nand see how they stand, and if we find that they have not done all that\r\nthey ought to have done with a view to prevent these serious evils,\r\nlet us undisguisedly and in plain language point out where we consider\r\nthey have erred, and by increasing public opinion in a healthy way\r\nagainst tyranny--some people call it, but perhaps a milder word would\r\nbe better--against the unwise policy used, it will do much to repress\r\nit in future” (_Conference Report_, Sheffield, 1866).\r\n\r\n[396] Rules adopted at Manchester Conference, 1867 (Sheffield, 1867, 12\r\npp.).\r\n\r\n[397] The Alliance was always administered by an executive elected\r\nby the Sheffield trades, the leading men amongst which had been\r\nactive in its formation. The veteran secretary of the Typographical\r\nSociety, William Dronfield, was the first general secretary. Among the\r\ntrades represented were the South Yorkshire and Nottingham Miners,\r\nthe Amalgamated Tailors, Boilermakers, Cotton-spinners, Scottish\r\nAssociated Carpenters, Yorkshire Glass-bottle Makers, North of England\r\nIronworkers, and the trades of Wolverhampton. The minute books from\r\n1867 to 1870, and its printed _Monthly Statement_, show that the\r\nAlliance at first supported the men in numerous lock-outs, especially\r\namong the tailors, miners, and ironworkers, but that there were\r\nconstant complaints of unpaid levies. Dronfield informed us that the\r\nJudicial Committee and the Executive experienced great difficulties\r\nfrom the absence of any control over the constituent Unions, and the\r\nimpossibility of accurately defining a lock-out. The first conference\r\nof the Alliance was held at Manchester from the 1st to the 4th of\r\nJanuary 1867, when fifty-three trades had been enrolled, numbering\r\n59,750 members. The “Rules” adopted at this conference contain an\r\ninteresting address by Dronfield upon the principles and objects of\r\nthe federation. The next conference was at Preston in September 1867,\r\nwhen the membership had fallen to 23,580, in forty-seven trades,\r\nthe Boilermakers, among others, formally withdrawing (_Minutes of\r\nConference at Preston_, Sheffield, 1867, 16 pp.).\r\n\r\n[398] The town of Sheffield had long been noted for the custom of\r\n“rattening,” that is, the temporary abstraction of the wheelbands or\r\ntools of a workman whose subscription to his club was in arrear. This\r\nhad become the recognised method of enforcing, not merely the payment\r\nof contributions, but also compliance with the trade regulations\r\nof the club. The lawless summary jurisdiction thus usurped by the\r\nSheffield clubs easily passed into more serious acts of lynch law\r\nif mere rattening proved ineffectual. Recalcitrant workmen were\r\nterrorised by explosions of cans of gunpowder in the troughs of their\r\ngrinding wheels, or thrown down their chimneys; and in some cases\r\nthese explosions caused serious injury. The various Grinders’ Unions\r\n(saw, file, sickle, fork, and fender) enjoyed an unhappy notoriety\r\nfor outrages of this nature, which had, from time to time, aroused\r\nthe spasmodic indignation of the local press, notably in 1843-4.\r\nAn attempt, in 1861, to blow up a small warehouse in Acorn Street\r\nprovoked a special outburst of public disapproval; and the minutes of\r\nthe London Trades Council record that already on this occasion the\r\nCouncil publicly expressed its abhorrence of such criminal violence.\r\nAfter this date there was for three or four years a diminution in the\r\nnumber of serious acts of violence committed; but the years 1865-6 saw\r\na renewal of the evil practices, especially in connection with the\r\nSaw-Grinders’ Union. The explosion in New Hereford Street in October\r\n1866 was afterwards proved to have been instigated by this Union in\r\norder to terrorise a certain Thomas Fernehough, who had twice deserted\r\nthe society, and was at the time working for a firm against whom the\r\nsaw-handle makers, as well as the saw-grinders, had struck.\r\n\r\n[399] Among other societies, the Amalgamated Engineers and Carpenters\r\nand the national Unions of Boilermakers and Ironfounders appear to have\r\ndeposited their rules.\r\n\r\n[400] _Beehive_, January 26, 1867.\r\n\r\n[401] Along with these, in helping and advising the Trade Unions at\r\nthis time, were Vernon Lushington, Godfrey Lushington (afterwards\r\nPermanent Under-Secretary of State for the Home Department), J. M.\r\nLudlow (afterwards Registrar of Friendly Societies), Neate (formerly\r\nProfessor of Political Economy and then M.P. for Oxford), Sir T. Fowell\r\nBuxton, M.P., and A. J. Mundella.\r\n\r\n[402] The Junta did not, however, confine its efforts to action before\r\nthe Commission. One of the taunts constantly thrown by the press at\r\nthe Trade Union leaders was that they did not themselves know what\r\nthey wanted. Partly as a reply to this, but also as a manifesto to\r\nconsolidate the Unionist forces, in the autumn of 1867 a Bill was\r\nprepared by Henry Crompton and laid before the Junta, and after\r\nconsiderable discussion adopted by them and by a delegate meeting\r\nof Trades held at the Bell Inn. It was introduced into the House of\r\nCommons early in the following session, and served as basis of the\r\nTrade Union demand at some of the elections in 1868, notably that of\r\nSheffield when A. J. Mundella first was candidate.\r\n\r\n[403] The Broadhead disclosures created a great stir, and Professor\r\nBeesly, who had ventured to point out “that a trades union murder was\r\nneither better nor worse than any other murder,” was denounced as an\r\napologist for crime, and nearly lost his professorship at University\r\nCollege, London, for his sturdy defence of the principle of Trade\r\nUnionism. See his pamphlet, _The Sheffield Outrages and the Meeting\r\nat Exeter Hall_, 1867, 16 pp.; and that by Richard Congreve, _Mr.\r\nBroadhead and the Anonymous Press_, 1867, 16 pp.\r\n\r\n[404] _Times_ leader, July 8, 1869. The occasion was the epoch-marking\r\nspeech of Mr. (afterwards Lord) Brassey, in which, speaking as the son\r\nof a great contractor, he declared himself on the side of the Trade\r\nUnions, and asserted that, by exercising a beneficial influence on the\r\ncharacter of the workmen, they tended to lower rather than to raise the\r\ncost of labour (Hansard’s Parliamentary Debates, July 7, 1869). The\r\nspeech was afterwards republished, with some additions, under the title\r\nof _Trade Unions and the Cost of Labour_, by T. Brassey, 1870, 64 pp.\r\n\r\n[405] The Sheffield Outrages and the Royal Commission produced a large\r\ncrop of literature, most of which is of little value. The Commission\r\nitself presented no fewer than eleven reports, with voluminous evidence\r\nand appendices. The Examiners appointed to investigate the outrages at\r\nSheffield and Manchester presented separate reports, which were laid\r\nbefore Parliament. The mass of detailed information about strikes and\r\nother proceedings of Trade Societies contained in these reports has\r\nbeen the main source of all subsequent writings on the subject. _The\r\nTrade Unions of England_, by the Comte de Paris, 1869, 246 pp., and\r\n_The Trade Unions_, by Robert Somers (Edinburgh, 1876, 232 pp.), are,\r\nfor instance, little better than summaries, the former friendly, the\r\nlatter unfriendly, of the evidence before the Commission. The chapters\r\nrelating to Trade Unionism in W. T. Thornton’s work _On Labour_, 1870,\r\nwhich made so permanent an impression on the economic world, are\r\nentirely based upon the same testimony. Among other publications may\r\nbe mentioned _Trades Unions Defended_, by W. R. Callender (Manchester,\r\n1870, 16 pp.); and _Measures for Putting an End to the Abuses of Trades\r\nUnions_, by Frederic Hill, 1868, 16 pp.\r\n\r\n[406] _Report of the Trades Conference_, 1867, 32 pp.\r\n\r\n[407] _Beehive_, June 13, 1868.\r\n\r\n[408] _Ibid._, August 28, 1869.\r\n\r\n[409] _Beehive_, January 26, 1867.\r\n\r\n[410] _Fortnightly Circular_, June 1868.\r\n\r\n[411] See, for instance, _Some opinions on Trade Unions and the Bill\r\nof 1869_, by Edmund Potter, M.P., 1869, 45 pp.; also the _Observations\r\nupon the Law of Combinations and Trades Unions, and upon the Trades\r\nUnions Bill_, by a Barrister, 1869, 64 pp.\r\n\r\n[412] In his _Letters to the Working Classes_, 1870, Professor Beesly\r\ngives a graphic account of the shuffling of the Government, and advises\r\npolitical action. The annual report of the General Union of House\r\nPainters (the “Manchester Alliance”) for 1871 shows how eagerly the\r\nadvice was received: “Away with the cry of no politics in our Unions;\r\nthis foolish neutrality has left us without power or influence.” See\r\nalso, for the whole episode, _Robert Applegarth_, by A. W. Humphrey,\r\n1912, pp. 138-170; _Labour Legislation, Labour Movements and Labour\r\nLeaders_, by G. Howell, 1902, pp. 156-172.\r\n\r\n[413] 32 and 33 Vic. c. 61 (1869). This provisional measure was\r\nbitterly opposed in the House of Lords by Earl Cairns, who argued that\r\nits universal protection of the funds of all Unions alike, without\r\nrequiring the abandonment of their objectionable rules, was in direct\r\nopposition to the majority report of the Royal Commission. No such\r\nsurrender to the Trade Unions was, in his opinion, necessary, as\r\ntheir funds had, in the previous year, been incidentally protected\r\nby an “Act to amend the law relating to larceny and embezzlement”\r\n(31 and 32 Vic. c. 116), passed at the instance of Russell Gurney,\r\nthe Recorder of London. This act had no reference to Trade Unions\r\nas such, but it enabled members of a co-partnership to be convicted\r\nfor stealing or embezzling the funds of their co-partnership. Its\r\npossible application to defaulting Trade Union officials was perceived\r\nby Messrs. Shaen, Roscoe & Co., who have for three generations acted\r\nas solicitors of the leading Unions. At their instance a case was\r\nsubmitted to the Attorney-General of the time (Sir John Karslake),\r\nwho advised that a Trade Union could now prosecute in its character\r\nof a partnership. Criminal proceedings were accordingly taken by the\r\nOperative Bricklayers’ Society against a defaulting officer who had set\r\nthe Executive at defiance, with the result that the prisoner was, in\r\nDecember 1868, sentenced to six months’ hard labour. This successful\r\nprosecution was widely advertised throughout the Trade Union world,\r\nand was frequently quoted as showing that no further legislation was\r\nneeded. But, as was forcibly pointed out by Frederic Harrison and\r\nother advisers of the Junta, Russell Gurney’s Act, though it enabled\r\nTrade Unions to put defaulting officials in prison, gave them no power\r\nto recover the sums due, or to take any civil proceedings whatever,\r\nand did not remove the illegality of any combinations of workmen “in\r\nrestraint of trade.” See Harrison’s article, “The Trades Union Bill,”\r\nin _Fortnightly Review_, July 1, 1869, and the leaflet published by the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Engineers, on Russell Gurney’s Act, December,\r\n1868.\r\n\r\n[414] See, for instance, the report of the Leeds meeting of the Master\r\nBuilders’ Association to object to the Bill, _Beehive_, March 11, 1871.\r\n\r\n[415] A short Act had been passed in 1859 (22 Vic. c. 34) which\r\nexcluded from the definition of “molestation” or “obstruction” the\r\nmere agreement to obtain an alteration of wages or hours, and also\r\nthe peaceful persuasion of others without threat or intimidation to\r\ncease or abstain from work in order to obtain the wages or hours aimed\r\nat. The Act was passed without discussion or comment, probably with\r\nreference to some recent judicial decisions, but its actual origin\r\nis not clear. The Stonemasons’ Society refused to have anything to\r\ndo with it, and referred sneeringly to its promoters as busybodies.\r\nAlexander Macdonald alluded to it in his speech on the Employers and\r\nWorkmen Bill on June 28, 1875 (Hansard, vol. 225, pp. 66-7), as having\r\nbeen enacted at the instance of himself and others in order to permit\r\nmen to persuade others to join combinations, and that it had had a\r\nmost beneficial effect. An obscure pamphlet, entitled _Letters to\r\nthe Trades Unionists and the Working Classes_, by Charles Sturgeon,\r\n1868, 8 pp., gives the only account of its origin that we have seen.\r\n“Some of the judges had decided that the liberty to combine was only\r\nduring the period he was not in the employ of any master (_i.e._ while\r\non tramp). So obvious a misreading, under which the working men were\r\ngetting imprisoned, while their masters combined at their pleasure,\r\ncreated numerous petitions for relief, which lay as usual on the table;\r\nhowever, the Executive of the National Association of United Trades\r\nassembled in my rooms in Abingdon Street, and we drew a little Bill of\r\nnine lines in length to explain to the judges how they had failed to\r\nexplain the views of the legislator.... I introduced our friends to the\r\nlate Henry Drummond, Thomas Duncombe, and Joseph Hume, two Radicals and\r\nan honest Tory, and, strange to say, they worked well together when in\r\npursuit of justice. After fighting hard against the great Liberal Party\r\nfor four or five years, we passed our little Bill (22 Vic. c. 34), to\r\nthe great joy of the working classes and chagrin of the Manchester\r\nRadicals.” But the decision of the R. _v._ Druitt and R. _v._ Bailey in\r\n1867 showed that it did not serve to protect pickets from prosecution.\r\n\r\n[416] Henry Crompton gives the following account of the practice of\r\npicketing:--“Picketing is generally much misunderstood. It occurs in\r\na strike when war has begun. The struggle, of course, consists in the\r\nemployer trying to get fresh men, and the men on strike trying to\r\nprevent this. They naturally do their best to induce all others to\r\njoin them. Very often the country is scoured by the employers, and men\r\nbrought long distances who never would have come if they had known\r\nthere was a strike. Men do not wish to undersell their fellows. A man\r\nis posted as a picket, to give information of the grievances complained\r\nof, and to urge the fresh comers not to defeat the strike that is going\r\non.\r\n\r\n“Not only is this justifiable, but it is far better that this should be\r\nlegal and practised in full publicity than that it should be illegal\r\nand done secretly, for, if done secretly, then bad practices are sure\r\nto arise. No doubt it is done with a view to coerce the employers, just\r\nas the lock-out is with a view to coerce the employed.\r\n\r\n“Picketing has other uses and effects. It enables those on strike to\r\nknow whether the employers are getting men, and what probability there\r\nis of the strike being successful, to check any fraudulent claims for\r\nstrike pay. Besides this, the publicity which the system of picketing\r\ngives does, doubtless, exercise a considerable influence upon men’s\r\nconduct. Those on strike naturally regard any one acting contrary\r\nto the general interests of the trade with disfavour, just as an\r\nunpatriotic man is condemned by those imbued with a higher sense of\r\nnational duty. Picketing is justified on these grounds by the workmen,\r\nbut all physical molestation or intimidation is condemned. The workmen\r\nhave never urged that such proceedings should not be repressed by penal\r\nlaw.” (See _The Labour Law Commission_, by Henry Crompton, adopted and\r\npublished by the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress.)\r\n\r\n[417] Baron Bramwell’s view of the law excited much animadversion even\r\namong lawyers. See Stephen’s _History of the Criminal Law_, vol. iii.\r\npp. 221-2. R. _v._ Druitt is reported in 10 Cox, 600.\r\n\r\n[418] R. _v._ Hewitt, 5 Cox, 162 (1851). Compare also the observations\r\nof Mr. Justice Hannam as to the mere act of striking being in itself\r\nsometimes criminal, in Farrer _v._ Close, 4 L.R.Q.B. 612 (1869).\r\n\r\n[419] R. _v._ Hewitt, 5 Cox, C.C. 163 (1851).\r\n\r\n[420] See Walsby _v._ Anley, 30 L.J.M.C. 121 (1861); Skinner _v._\r\nKitch, 10 Cox, 493 (1867); O’Neil _v._ Kruger, 4 Best and Smith,\r\n389 (1863); Wood _v._ Bowron, 2 Law Report, Q.B. 21 (1866); R. _v._\r\nRowlands, 5 Cox, C.C. 493 (1851).\r\n\r\nCompare on the whole subject the Appendix to our _Industrial\r\nDemocracy_, 1897; _The Law of Criminal Conspiracies and Agreements_,\r\nby R. S. (afterwards Mr. Justice) Wright (1873); Sir William Erle’s\r\n_Law Relating to Trade Unions_ (1873); and Stephen’s _History of the\r\nCriminal Law_, vol. iii. chap. xxx.\r\n\r\n[421] Whilst the constant meetings of the Junta, the informal cabinet\r\nof the movement, grew out of the great Amalgamated Societies, the\r\nTrades Union Congress, or “Parliament of Labour,” took its rise in\r\nthe Trades Councils. We have already described the special Conference\r\nheld in London in 1864, on the Master and Servant Law, which was\r\nconvened by the Glasgow Trades Council, and its successor, summoned by\r\nthe Sheffield Trades Council in 1867 to concert measures of defence\r\nagainst lock-outs. But the credit of initiating the idea of an Annual\r\nConference to deal with all subjects of interest to the Trade Union\r\nworld belongs to the Manchester and Salford Trades Council, who issued\r\nin April 1868 a circular (fortunately preserved in the _Ironworkers’\r\nJournal_ for May 1868, and printed at the end of this volume)\r\nconvening a Congress to be held in Manchester during Whit-week, 1868.\r\nThis Congress was attended by thirty-four delegates, who claimed to\r\nrepresent about 118,000 Trade Unionists. The place of meeting of the\r\nnext Congress was fixed at Birmingham, and the delegates were in due\r\ncourse convened by the Birmingham Trades Council. This second Congress,\r\nwhich met in August 1869, included forty-eight delegates from forty\r\nseparate societies, having, it was said, 250,000 members. But although\r\nthese general congresses were attended by some of the most prominent\r\nof the provincial Trade Unionists, they were rather frowned on by the\r\nLondon Junta. The thirty-four delegates at the Manchester Congress\r\nincluded indeed hardly any Metropolitan delegates other than George\r\nPotter. Half a dozen representatives from London societies went to\r\nthe Birmingham Congress, including Odger and George Howell, but when\r\na Parliamentary Committee was appointed Odger refused to serve upon\r\nit, regarding it apparently as an unnecessary rival of the Conference\r\nof Amalgamated Trades. The next Congress was appointed for London in\r\n1870, but the London leaders took no steps to convene it, until it\r\nbecame necessary, as we have seen, to call up all forces to oppose\r\nthe projected legislation of 1871. The London Congress of March 1871\r\nwas, in fact, the first in which the real leaders of the movement took\r\npart, and the Parliamentary Committee which it appointed, acting at\r\nfirst in conjunction with Applegarth’s Conference, naturally took the\r\nplace of this on its dissolution. The 1872 Congress at Nottingham was\r\nattended by seventy-seven delegates, representing 375,000 members.\r\nReports of the earliest four congresses must be sought in the _Beehive_\r\nand (as regards those of Manchester, Birmingham, and Nottingham) in\r\nthe contemporary local newspapers. From 1873 onward the Congress has\r\nissued an authorised report of its proceedings. A useful chronological\r\nrecord has now been published by W. J. Davis, entitled _A History of\r\nthe British Trades Union Congress_, vol. i. 1910; vol. ii. 1916.\r\n\r\n[422] 34 and 35 Vic. c. 31 (Trade Union Act), and 34 and 35 Vic. c. 32\r\n(Criminal Law Amendment Act).\r\n\r\n[423] See, for instance, the article by Henry Crompton in the\r\n_Beehive_, September 2, 1871.\r\n\r\n[424] The Operative Bricklayers’ Society (London), of which Coulson was\r\ngeneral secretary, stands No. 1 on the Register.\r\n\r\n[425] _Digest of the Labour Laws_, signed by F.

It will be found in the\r\n_Beehive_ for February 13, 1875:--\r\n\r\n“Avignon, _February 19, 1871_.\r\n\r\n“Dear Mr. Odger,--Although you have not been successful, I congratulate\r\nyou on the result of the polling in Southwark, as it proves that you\r\nhave the majority of the Liberal party with you, and that you have\r\ncalled out an increased amount of political feeling in the borough. It\r\nis plain that the Whigs intend to monopolise political power as long\r\nas they can without coalescing in any degree with the Radicals. The\r\nworking men are quite right in allowing Tories to get into the House\r\nto defeat this exclusive feeling of the Whigs, and may do it without\r\nsacrificing any principle. The working men’s policy is to insist upon\r\ntheir own representation, and in default of success to permit Tories to\r\nbe sent into the House until the Whig majority is seriously threatened,\r\nwhen, of course, the Whigs will be happy to compromise, and allow a few\r\nworking men representatives in the House.\r\n\r\nJohn Stuart Mill.”\r\n\r\n[431] _Beehive_, August 9, 1873; see also that of August 30.\r\n\r\n[432] Halliday, the Secretary of the Amalgamated Association of Miners,\r\noffered himself as Labour candidate for Merthyr Tydvil. A fortnight\r\nbefore the polling day he was indicted at Burnley for conspiracy in\r\nconnection with a local miners’ strike, but nevertheless went to the\r\npoll, receiving the large total of 4912 votes (_Beehive_, January 31,\r\n1874). Among the other “third candidates” were Broadhurst (Wycombe),\r\nHowell (Aylesbury), Cremer (Warwick), Lucraft (Finsbury), Potter\r\n(Peterborough), Bradlaugh (Northampton), Kane (Middlesborough), Odger\r\n(Southwark), Mottershead (Preston), and Walton (Stoke). See _History of\r\nLabour Representation_, by A. W. Humphrey, 1912.\r\n\r\n[433] See House of Commons Returns, No. 237 of the 2nd, and No. 273 of\r\nthe 23rd of June 1875.\r\n\r\n[434] It is not surprising that this sweeping Parliamentary triumph\r\nevoked great enthusiasm in the Trade Union ranks. At the Trade Union\r\nCongress in October 1875, such ardent Radicals as Odger, Guile, and\r\nGeorge Howell joined in the warmest eulogies of J. K. (afterwards\r\nViscount) Cross, whose sympathetic attitude had surpassed their utmost\r\nhopes. “The best friends they had in Parliament,” said Howell, “with\r\none or two exceptions, never declared for the repeal of the Criminal\r\nLaw Amendment Act. He, with some friends, was under the gallery of the\r\nHouse of Commons when the measure was under discussion, and they could\r\nscarcely believe their ears when they heard Mr. Cross declare for the\r\ntotal repeal of the Act.” And Odger paid testimony to the “immense\r\nsingleness of purpose” with which the Home Secretary “had attended\r\nto every proposition that had been placed before him,” and accorded\r\nthem “the greatest boon ever given to the sons of toil.” An amendment\r\ndeprecating such “fulsome recognition of the action of the Conservative\r\nparty” received only four votes (Report of Glasgow Congress, 1875).\r\nSome minor amendments of the law relating to the registration and\r\nfriendly benefits of Trade Unions were embodied in the Trade Union Act\r\nAmendment Act of 1876 (39 and 40 Vic. c. 22).

In numberless cases you refuse to descend and ascend\r\nwith non-Unionists. The right or wrong of such action I will not now\r\ndiscuss; but what is the actual state of things found in many parts of\r\nthe country? While you refuse to descend and ascend with these men, you\r\nwalk to and from the pit, walk in and out bye with them--nay, sometimes\r\nwork with them. You mingle with them at home over your glass of beer,\r\nin your chapels, and side by side you pray with them in your prayer\r\nmeeting. The time has come when there must be plain speaking on this\r\nmatter. It is no use playing at shuttlecock in this important portion\r\nof our social life. Either mingle with these men in the shaft, as you\r\ndo in every other place, or let them be ostracised at all times and\r\nin every place. Regard them as unfit companions for yourselves and\r\nyour sons, and unfit husbands for your daughters. Let them be branded,\r\nas it were, with the curse of Cain, as unfit to mingle in ordinary,\r\nhonest, and respectable society. Until you make up your minds to thus\r\ncompletely and absolutely ostracise these goats of mankind, cease to\r\ncomplain as to any results that may arise from their action.” Compare\r\n_A Great Labour Leader_ [Thomas Burt], by Aaron Watson, 1908.\r\n\r\n[440] See his letter on the Government Annuities Bill, 1864: “Lastly,\r\nwe are told of Government dictation and interference. I cannot believe\r\nmen of sense will say this twice seriously.... Leave it to the\r\npolitical economists to complain.... Let working men remember that\r\nwhenever a measure in their interest is proposed to Parliament, or\r\nsuggested in the country--whether it be to limit excessive hours of\r\nlabour, to protect women and children, to regulate unhealthy labour,\r\nto provide them with the means of health, cleanliness, or recreation,\r\nto save them from the exactions of unscrupulous employers--it is\r\nuniversally met with opposition from one quarter, that of unrestricted\r\ncompetition; and opposed on one ground, that of absolute freedom of\r\nprivate enterprise. We all know--at least, we all explain--how selfish\r\nand shallow this cry is in the mouth of unscrupulous capitalists who\r\nresist the Truck System Bill or the Ten Hours Bill. Is it not suicidal\r\nin working men to raise a cry which has ever been, and still will\r\nbe, the great resource of those who strive to set obstacles to their\r\nwelfare? The next time working men promote a Short Time Bill of any\r\nkind they will be told to stick to their principle of non-interference\r\nwith private capital” (_Beehive_, March 19, 1864).\r\n\r\n[441] From 1861 to 1877 the principal working-class organ was the\r\n_Beehive_, established by a group of Trade Unionists who formed a\r\ncompany in which over a hundred Unions are said to have taken shares.\r\nThe editor and virtual proprietor during its whole life appears to\r\nhave been George Potter, who was assisted by a Consulting Committee,\r\non which appeared, at some time or another, the names of all the\r\nleading London Trade Unionists. Potter, as we have already mentioned,\r\nwas a man of equivocal character and conduct, who at no time held any\r\nimportant position in the Trade Union world, though his London Working\r\nMen’s Association made a useful start of the movement for Trade Union\r\nrepresentation in the House of Commons. Under his editorship the\r\n_Beehive_ became the best Labour newspaper which has yet appeared. This\r\nwas due to the persistent support of Frederic Harrison, Henry Crompton,\r\nE. S. Beesly, Lloyd Jones, and other friends of Trade Unionism who,\r\nfor fifteen years, contributed innumerable articles, whilst such Trade\r\nUnion leaders as Applegarth, Howell, and Shipton frequently appeared in\r\nits columns. These contributions make it of the greatest possible value\r\nto the student of Trade Union history. Unfortunately, the most complete\r\nfile in any public library--that in the British Museum--begins only in\r\n1869. Mr. John Burns possesses a unique set beginning in 1863, which\r\nhe kindly placed at our disposal. In 1877 it was converted into the\r\n_Industrial Review_, which came to an end in 1879.\r\n\r\nThe place of the _Beehive_ was, in 1881, to some extent taken by the\r\n_Labour Standard_, a penny weekly established by George Shipton, the\r\nSecretary of the London Trades Council. It ran from May 7, 1881, to\r\nApril 29, 1882, and contained articles by Henry Crompton and Professor\r\nE. S. Beesly, together with much Trade Union information.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nSECTIONAL DEVELOPMENTS\r\n\r\n[1863-1885]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom 1851 to 1863 all the effective forces in the Trade Union Movement\r\nwere centred in London. Between 1863 and 1867, as we described in the\r\ncourse of the last chapter, provincial organisations, such as the\r\nGlasgow and Sheffield Trades Councils, and provincial leaders such as\r\nAlexander Macdonald and John Kane, began to play an important part in\r\nthe general movement. The dramatic crisis of 1867, and the subsequent\r\npolitical struggle, compelled us to break off our description of the\r\ngrowth of the movement in order to follow the Parliamentary action of\r\nthe London leaders. But whilst the Junta and their allies were winning\r\ntheir great victories at Westminster, the centre of gravity of the\r\nTrade Union world was being insensibly shifted from London to the\r\nindustrial districts north of the Humber. This was primarily due to the\r\nrapid growth of two great provincial organisations, the federations of\r\nCoal-miners and Cotton Operatives.\r\n\r\nThe Miners, now one of the most powerful contingents of the Trade Union\r\nforces, were, until 1863, without any effective organisation. The\r\nMiners’ Association of Great Britain, which, as we have seen, sprang\r\nin 1841-43 into a vigorous existence, collapsed in 1848. An energetic\r\nattempt made by Martin Jude to re-establish a National Association\r\nin 1850, when a conference was held at Newcastle, was, in consequence\r\nof the continued depression in the coal trade, entirely unsuccessful.\r\nFor the next few years “the fragments of union that existed got less\r\nby degrees and more minute till, at the close of 1855, it might be\r\nsaid that union among the miners in the whole country had almost died\r\nout.”[442] The revival which took place between 1858 and 1863 was due,\r\nin the main, to the persistent work of the able man who became for\r\nfifteen years their trusted leader.\r\n\r\nAlexander Macdonald, to whose lifelong devotion the miners owe their\r\npresent position in the Trade Union world, stands, like William Newton,\r\nmidway between the casual and amateur leaders of the old Trade Unionism\r\nand the paid officials of the new type. Himself originally a miner and\r\nthe son of a miner, the education and independent means which he had\r\nacquired enabled him, from 1857 onwards, to apply himself continuously\r\nto the miners’ cause. A florid style, and somewhat flashy personality,\r\ndid him no harm with the rough and uneducated workmen whom he had to\r\nmarshal. The main source of his effectiveness lay, however, neither\r\nin his oratory nor in his powers of organisation, but in his exact\r\nappreciation of the particular changes that would remedy the miners’\r\ngrievances, and in the tactical skill with which he embodied these\r\nchanges in legislative form. Like his friends, Allan and Applegarth,\r\nhe relied almost exclusively on Parliamentary agitation as a means for\r\nsecuring his ends. But whilst the Junta were contenting themselves\r\nwith securing political freedom for Trade Unionists, Macdonald from\r\nthe first persistently pressed for the legislative regulation of the\r\nconditions of labour. And though, like his London allies, he consorted\r\nlargely with the middle-class friends of Trade Unionism, and freely\r\nutilised their help in the House of Commons, he proved his superior\r\noriginality and tenacity of mind by never in the slightest degree\r\nabandoning the fundamental principle of Trade Unionism--the compulsory\r\nmaintenance of the workman’s Standard of Life.\r\n\r\n“It was in 1856,” said Macdonald on a later occasion, “that I crossed\r\nthe Border first to advocate a better Mines Act, true weighing, the\r\neducation of the young, the restriction of the age till twelve years,\r\nthe reduction of the working hours to eight in every twenty-four, the\r\ntraining of managers, the payment of wages weekly in the current coin\r\nof the realm, no truck, and many other useful things too numerous to\r\nmention here. Shortly after that, bone began to come to bone, and by\r\n1858 we were in full action for better laws.”[443] The pit clubs and\r\ninformal committees that pressed these demands upon the legislature\r\nbecame centres of local organisation, with which Macdonald kept up an\r\nincessant correspondence. An arbitrary lock-out of several thousand\r\nmen by the South Yorkshire coal-owners in 1858 welded the miners\r\nof that coalfield into a compact district association, and enabled\r\nMacdonald, in the same year, to get together a national conference at\r\nAshton-under-Lyne, at which, however, the delegates could claim to\r\nrepresent only four thousand men in union. In 1860, when the Mines\r\nRegulation Act was being passed into law, Macdonald was able to score\r\na success in the “checkweigher” clause, to which we shall again refer.\r\nNot until the end of 1863, however, can the Miners’ National Union\r\nbe said to have been effectively established; and the proceedings of\r\nthe Leeds Conference of that year strike the note of the policy which\r\nMacdonald, to the day of his death, never ceased to press upon the\r\nminers, and to which the great majority of them have now, after a\r\ntemporary digression, once more returned.\r\n\r\nThe Miners’ Conference at Leeds was in many respects a notable\r\ngathering. Instead of the formless interchange of talk which had marked\r\nthe previous conference, Macdonald induced the fifty-one delegates\r\nwho sat from the 9th to the 14th of November 1863 at the People’s\r\nCo-operative Hall to organise their meeting on the model of the\r\nNational Association for the Promotion of Social Science, and divide\r\nthemselves into three sections, on Law, on Grievances, and on Social\r\nOrganisation, each of which reported to the whole conference.[444] The\r\nproceedings of the day were opened with prayer by the “Chaplain to\r\nthe Conference,” the Rev. Joseph Rayner Stephens, celebrated as the\r\nopponent of the New Poor Law and the advocate of factory legislation\r\nand Chartism.[445] In the reports of the sections and the numerous\r\nresolutions of the conference we find all the points of Macdonald’s\r\nprogramme. The paramount importance of securing the Standard of Life by\r\nmeans of legislative regulation of the conditions of work is embodied\r\nin a lengthy series of proposals which have nearly all since been\r\ninserted in the detailed code of mining law. In contradistinction to\r\nthe view which would make wages depend upon prices, the principle\r\nof controlling industry in such a way as to prevent encroachments\r\non the workman’s standard maintenance is clearly foreshadowed.\r\n“Overtoil,” says the report, “produces over-supply; low prices and low\r\nwages follow; bad habits and bad health follow, of course; and then\r\ndiminished production and profits are inevitable. Reduction of toil,\r\nand consequent improved bodily health, increases production in the\r\nsense of profit; and limits it so as to avoid overstocking; better\r\nwages induce better habits, and economy of working follows.... The\r\nevil of overtoil and over-supply upon wages, and upon the labourer, is\r\ntherefore a fair subject of complaint; and, we submit, as far as these\r\nare human by conventional arrangements, are a fair and proper subject\r\nof regulation. Regulations must, of course, be twofold. Part can be\r\nlegislated for by compulsory laws; but the principle (_sic_) must be\r\nthe subject of voluntary agreement.”[446] The restriction of labour in\r\nmines to a maximum of eight hours per day was strongly urged; but at\r\nMacdonald’s instance it was astutely resolved not to ask for a legal\r\nregulation of the hours of adult men, but to confine the Parliamentary\r\nproposal to a Bill for boys. And it is interesting to observe already\r\nat this time the beginning of the deep cleavage between the miners of\r\nNorthumberland and Durham and their fellow-workers elsewhere. The close\r\nconnection between the legal regulation of the hours of boys and the\r\nfixing of the men’s day is brought out by William Crawford; the future\r\nleader of the Durham men. The general feeling of the conference was\r\nin favour of a drastic legal prohibition of boys being kept in the\r\nmine for more than eight hours, but Crawford declared that “an eight\r\nhours bill could not be carried out in his district. He wanted the boys\r\nto work ten hours a day, and the men six hours.”[447] He therefore\r\nproposed a legal Ten Hours Day for the boys. The conference, however,\r\ndeclined to depart from the principle of Eight Hours; and the Bill\r\ndrafted in this sense was eventually adopted without dissent.\r\n\r\nAnother reform advocated by Macdonald has had far-reaching though\r\nunforeseen effect upon the miners’ organisation. The arbitrary\r\nconfiscation of the miners’ pay for any tubs or hutches which were\r\ndeclared to be improperly filled had long been a source of extreme\r\nirritation. It had become a regular practice of unscrupulous\r\ncoal-owners to condemn a considerable percentage of the men’s\r\nhutches, and thus escape payment for part of the coal hewn. The\r\ngrievance was aggravated by the absolute dependence of the miner,\r\nworking underground, upon the honesty and accuracy of the agent of\r\nthe employer on the surface, who recorded the amount of his work. A\r\ndemand was accordingly made by the men for permission to have their own\r\nrepresentative at the pit-bank, who should check the weight to be paid\r\nfor. During the year 1859 great contests took place in South Yorkshire,\r\nin which, after embittered resistance, the employers in several\r\ncollieries conceded this boon. A determined attempt was then made by\r\nthe South Yorkshire Miners’ Union, aided by Macdonald, to insert a\r\nclause in the Mines Regulation Bill, making it compulsory to weigh the\r\ncoal, and to allow a representative of the men to check the weight.\r\nA great Parliamentary fight took place on the men’s amendment, with\r\nthe result that the Act of 1860 empowered the miners of each pit to\r\nappoint a checkweigher, but confined their choice to persons actually\r\nin employment at the particular mine.[448] This important victory was\r\nlong rendered nugatory by the evasions of the coal-owners. At Barnsley,\r\nfor instance, Normansell, appointed checkweigher, was promptly\r\ndismissed from employment and refused access to the pit’s mouth. When\r\nthe employer was fined for this breach of the law he appealed to the\r\nQueen’s Bench; and it cost the Union two years of costly litigation\r\nto enforce the reinstatement of the men’s agent.[449] The next twenty\r\nyears are full of attempts by coal-owners to avoid compliance with\r\nthis law. Where the men could not be persuaded or terrified into\r\nforgoing their right to appoint a checkweigher, every device was used\r\nto hamper his work. Sometimes he was excluded from close access to the\r\nweighing-machine. In other pits the weights were fenced up so that\r\nhe could not clearly see them. His calculations were hotly disputed,\r\nand his interference bitterly resented. The Miners’ Unions, however,\r\nsteadily fought their way to perfect independence for the checkweigher.\r\nThe Mines Regulation Act of 1872 slightly strengthened his position.\r\nFinally the Act of 1887, confirmed by that of 1911, made clear the\r\nright of the men, by a decision of the majority of those employed in\r\nany pit, to have, at the expense of the whole pit, a checkweigher with\r\nfull power to keep an accurate and independent record of each man’s\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIt would be interesting to trace to what extent the special\r\ncharacteristics of the miners’ organisations are due to the influence\r\nof this one legislative reform. Its recognition and promotion\r\nof collective action by the men has been a direct incitement to\r\ncombination. The compulsory levy, upon the whole pit, of the cost of\r\nmaintaining the agent whom a bare majority could decide to appoint\r\nhas practically found, for each colliery, a branch secretary free\r\nof expense to the Union. But the result upon the character of the\r\nofficials has been even more important. The checkweigher has to be\r\na man of character insensible to the bullying or blandishments of\r\nmanager or employers. He must be of strictly regular habits, accurate\r\nand business-like in mind, and quick at figures. The ranks of the\r\ncheckweighers serve thus as an admirable recruiting ground from which a\r\npractically inexhaustible supply of efficient Trade Union secretaries\r\nor labour representatives can be drawn.\r\n\r\nThe Leeds Conference of 1863 was the first of a series of yearly\r\nor half-yearly gatherings of miners’ delegates which did much to\r\nconsolidate their organisation. The powerful aid brought by Macdonald\r\nto the movement for the Master and Servant Act of 1867 has already\r\nbeen described. But between 1864 and 1869 the almost uninterrupted\r\nsuccession of strikes and lock-outs, in one county or another,\r\nprevented the National Association from taking a firm hold on the men\r\nin the less organised districts. In 1869 a rival federation, called\r\nthe Amalgamated Association of Miners, was formed by the men of some\r\nLancashire pits, to secure more systematic support of local strikes.\r\nThis split only increased the number of miners in union, which in a few\r\nyears reached the unprecedented total of two hundred thousand.\r\n\r\nIt is easy to understand how much this army of miners, marshalled by\r\nan expert Parliamentary tactician, added to the political weight of\r\nthe Trade Union leaders. Though only partially enfranchised, their\r\ninfluence at the General Election of 1868 was marked; and when, in\r\n1871, the Trades Union Congress appointed a Parliamentary Committee\r\nMacdonald became its chairman. Next year he succeeded in getting\r\nembodied in the new Mines Regulation Act many of the minor amendments\r\nof the law for which he had been pressing; and in 1874 he and his\r\ncolleague, Thomas Burt, became, as we have seen, the first working-men\r\nmembers of the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nNot less important than the somewhat scattered hosts of the Coal-miners\r\nwas the compact body of the Lancashire Cotton Operatives, who,\r\nfrom 1869 onward, began to be reckoned as an integral part of the\r\nTrade Union world. The Lancashire textile workers, who had, in the\r\nearly part of the century, played such a prominent part in the\r\nTrade Union Movement, and whose energetic “Short Time Committees”\r\nhad, in 1847, obtained the Ten Hours Act, appear to have fallen,\r\nduring the subsequent years, into a state of disorganisation and\r\ndisunion. In 1853, it is true, the present Amalgamated Association\r\nof Cotton-spinners was established; but this federal Union was\r\nweakened, until 1869, by the abstention or lukewarmness of the local\r\norganisations of such important districts as Oldham and Bolton. The\r\ncotton-weavers were in a somewhat similar condition. The Blackburn\r\nAssociation, established in 1853, was gradually overshadowed by the\r\nNorth-East Lancashire Association, a federation of the local weavers’\r\nsocieties in the smaller towns, established in 1858. This association,\r\ngrowing out of a secession from the Blackburn organisation, had for its\r\nspecial object the combined support of a skilled calculator of prices,\r\nable to defend the operatives’ interests in the constant discussions\r\nwhich arose upon the complicated lists of piecework rates which\r\ncharacterise the English cotton industry.[450]\r\n\r\nIt is difficult to convey to the general reader any adequate idea of\r\nthe important effect which these elaborate “Lists” have had upon the\r\nTrade Union Movement in Lancashire. The universal satisfaction with,\r\nand even preference for, the piecework system among the Lancashire\r\ncotton operatives is entirely due to the existence of these definitely\r\nfixed and published statements. An even more important result has been\r\nthe creation of a peculiar type of Trade Union official. For although\r\nthe lists are elaborately worked out in detail--the Bolton Spinning\r\nList, for instance, comprising eighty-five pages closely filled with\r\nfigures[451]--the intricacy of the calculations is such as to be beyond\r\nthe comprehension not only of the ordinary operative or manufacturer,\r\nbut even of the investigating mathematician without a very minute\r\nknowledge of the technical detail. Yet the week’s earnings of every one\r\nof the tens of thousands of operatives are computed by an exact and\r\noften a separate calculation under these lists. And when an alteration\r\nof the list is in question, the standard wage of a whole district may\r\ndepend upon the quickness and accuracy with which the operatives’\r\nnegotiator apprehends the precise effect of each projected change in\r\nany of the numerous factors in the calculation. It will be obvious that\r\nfor work of this nature the successful organiser or “born orator”\r\nwas frequently quite unfit. There grew up, therefore, both among the\r\nweavers and the spinners, a system of selection of new secretaries by\r\ncompetitive examination, which has gradually been perfected as the\r\nexaminers--that is, the existing officials--have themselves become\r\nmore skilled. The first secretary to undergo this ordeal was Thomas\r\nBirtwistle,[452] who in 1861 began his thirty years’ honourable and\r\nsuccessful service of the Lancashire Weavers. Within a few years he was\r\nreinforced by other officials selected for the same characteristics.\r\nFrom 1871 onwards the counsels of the Trade Union Movement were\r\nstrengthened by the introduction of “the cotton men,” a body of keen,\r\nastute, and alert-minded officials--a combination, in the Trade Union\r\nworld, of the accountant and the lawyer.\r\n\r\nUnder such guidance the Lancashire cotton operatives achieved\r\nextraordinary success. Their first task was in all districts to\r\nobtain and perfect the lists. The rate and method of remuneration\r\nbeing in this way secured, their energy was devoted to improving the\r\nother conditions of their labour by means of appropriate legislation.\r\nEver since 1830 the Lancashire operatives, especially the spinners,\r\nhave strongly supported the legislative regulation of the hours and\r\nother conditions of their industry. In 1867 a delegate meeting of the\r\nLancashire textile operatives, under the presidency of the Rev. J. R.\r\nStephens, had resolved “to agitate for such a measure of legislative\r\nrestriction as shall secure a uniform Eight Hours Bill in factories,\r\nexclusive of meal-times, for adults, females, and young persons, and\r\nthat such Eight Hours Bill have for its foundation a restriction\r\non the moving power.”[453] On the improvement of trade and the\r\nrevival of Trade Union strength in 1871-72 this policy was again\r\nresorted to. The Oldham spinners tried, indeed, in 1871, to secure a\r\n“Twelve-o’clock Saturday” by means of a strike. But on the failure of\r\nthis attempt the delegates of the various local societies, both of\r\nspinners and weavers--usually the officials of the trade--met together\r\nand established, on the 7th of January 1872, the Factory Acts Reform\r\nAssociation, for the purpose of obtaining such an amendment of the law\r\nas would reduce the hours of labour from sixty to fifty-four per week.\r\n\r\nThe Parliamentary policy of these shrewd tacticians is only another\r\ninstance of the practical opportunism of the English Trade Unionist.\r\nThe cotton officials demurred in 1872 to an overt alliance with the\r\nParliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress, just then engaged\r\nin its heated agitation for a repeal of the Criminal Law Amendment\r\nAct. “Some members of the Short Time Committee,” states, without\r\nresentment, the Congress report, “thought that even co-operation\r\nwith the Congress Committee would be disastrous rather than useful,\r\n... as Lord Shaftesbury and others declared they would not undertake\r\na measure proposed in the interest of the Trades Unions.”[454] So\r\nfar as the public and the House of Commons were concerned, the Bill\r\nwas accordingly, as we are told, “based upon quite other grounds.”\r\nIts provisions were ostensibly restricted, like those of the Ten\r\nHours Act, to women and children; and to the support of Trade Union\r\nchampions such as Thomas Hughes and A. J. Mundella was added that\r\nof such philanthropists as Lord Shaftesbury and Samuel Morley. But\r\nit is scarcely necessary to say that it was not entirely, or even\r\nexclusively, for the sake of the women and children that the skilled\r\nleaders of the Lancashire cotton operatives had diverted their “Short\r\nTime Movement” from aggressive strikes to Parliamentary agitation.\r\nThe private minutes of the Factory Acts Reform Association contain\r\nno mention of the woes of the women and the children, but reflect\r\nthroughout the demand of the adult male spinners for a shorter day.\r\nAnd in the circular “to the factory operatives,” calling the original\r\nmeeting of the association, we find the spinners’ secretary combating\r\nthe fallacy that “any legislative interference with male adult\r\nlabour is an economic error,” and demanding “a legislative enactment\r\nlargely curtailing the hours of factory labour,” in order that his\r\nconstituents, who were exclusively adult males, might enjoy “the nine\r\nhours per day, or fifty-four hours per week, so liberally conceded to\r\nother branches of workmen.”[455] It was, however, neither necessary nor\r\nexpedient to take this line in public. The experience of a generation\r\nhad taught the Lancashire operatives that any effective limitation of\r\nthe factory day for women and children could not fail to bring with it\r\nan equivalent shortening of the hours of the men who worked with them.\r\nAnd in the state of mind, in 1872, of the House of Commons, and even of\r\nthe workmen in other trades, it would have proved as impossible as it\r\ndid in 1847 to secure an avowed restriction of the hours of male adults.\r\n\r\nThe Short Time Bill was therefore so drafted as to apply in express\r\nterms only to women and children, whose sufferings under a ten hours\r\nday were made much of on the platform and in the press. The battle, in\r\nfact, was, as one of the leading combatants has declared,[456] “fought\r\nfrom behind the women’s petticoats.” But it was a part of the irony of\r\nthe situation that, as Broadhurst subsequently pointed out,[457] the\r\nBill “encountered great opposition from the female organisations”;\r\nand it was, in fact, expressly in the interests of working women that\r\nProfessor Fawcett, in the session of 1873, moved the rejection of\r\nthe measure.[458] Even as limited to women and children the proposal\r\nencountered a fierce resistance from the factory owners and the\r\ncapitalists of all industries. The opinion of the House of Commons\r\nwas averse from any further restriction upon the employers’ freedom.\r\nThe Ministry of the day lent it no assistance. The Bill, introduced\r\nin 1872, and again in 1873, made no progress. At length, in 1873, the\r\nGovernment shelved the question by appointing a Royal Commission to\r\ninquire into the working of the Factory Acts. But a General Election\r\nwas now drawing near; and “a Factory Nine Hours Bill for Women and\r\nChildren” was incorporated in the Parliamentary programme pressed upon\r\ncandidates by the whole Trade Union world.[459]\r\n\r\nWe have already pointed out what an attentive ear the Conservative\r\nparty was at this time giving to the Trade Union demands. It is\r\ntherefore not surprising that when Mundella, in the new Parliament,\r\nonce more introduced his Bill, the Home Secretary, Mr. (afterwards\r\nViscount) Cross, announced that the Government would bring forward\r\na measure of their own. The fact that the Government draft was\r\neuphemistically entitled the “Factories (Health of Women, etc.) Bill”\r\ndid not conciliate the opponents of the shorter factory day which\r\nit ensured; but, to the great satisfaction of the spinners, this\r\nopposition was unsuccessful; and, if not a nine hours day, at any rate\r\na 56½ hours week became law. This short and successful Parliamentary\r\ncampaign brought the cotton operatives into closer contact with\r\nthe London leaders; and from 1875 the Lancashire representatives\r\nexercised an important influence in the Trades Union Congress and its\r\nParliamentary Committee. Henceforth detailed amendments of the Factory\r\nActs, and increased efficiency in their administration, become almost\r\nstanding items in the official Trade Union programme.\r\n\r\nAn interesting parallelism might be traced between the cotton\r\noperatives on the one hand and the coal-miners on the other. To\r\noutward seeming no two occupations could be more unlike. Yet without\r\ncommunity of interest, without official intercourse, and without any\r\ntraceable imitation, the organisations of the two trades show striking\r\nresemblances to each other in history, in structural development,\r\nand in characteristics of policy, method, and aims. Many of these\r\nsimilarities may arise from the remarkable local aggregation in\r\nparticular districts, which is common to both industries. From this\r\nlocal aggregation spring, perhaps, the possibilities of a strong\r\nfederation existing without centralised funds, and of a permanent trade\r\nsociety enduring without friendly benefits. A further similarity may be\r\nseen in the creation, in each case, of a special class of Trade Union\r\nofficials, far more numerous in proportion to membership than is usual\r\nin the engineering or building trades. But the most noticeable, and\r\nperhaps the most important, of these resemblances is the constancy with\r\nwhich both the miners and the cotton operatives have adhered to the\r\nlegislative protection of the Standard of Life as a leading principle\r\nof their Trade Unionism.\r\n\r\nWhilst these important divisions of the Trade Union army were aiming\r\nat legislative protection, victories in another field were bringing\r\nwhole sections of Trade Unionists to a different conclusion. The\r\nsuccessful Nine Hours Movement of 1871-72--the reduction, by collective\r\nbargaining, of the hours of labour in the engineering and building\r\ntrades--rivalled the legislative triumphs of the miners and the cotton\r\noperatives.\r\n\r\nSince the great strikes in the London building trades in 1859-61, the\r\nmovement in favour of a reduction of the hours of labour had been\r\ndragging on in various parts of the country. The masons, carpenters,\r\nand other building operatives had in many towns, and after more or\r\nless conflict, secured what was termed the Nine Hours Day. In 1866\r\nan agitation arose among the engineers of Tyneside for a similar\r\nconcession; but the sudden depression of trade put an end to the\r\nproject. In 1870, when the subject was discussed at the Newcastle\r\n“Central District Committee” of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers,\r\nthe spirit of caution prevailed, and no action was taken. Suddenly, at\r\nthe beginning of 1871, the Sunderland men took the matter up, and came\r\nout on strike on the 1st of April. After four weeks’ struggle, almost\r\nbefore the engineers elsewhere had realised that there was any chance\r\nof success, the local employers gave way, and the Nine Hours Day was\r\nwon.\r\n\r\nIt was evident that the Sunderland movement was destined to spread to\r\nthe other engineering centres in the neighbourhood; and the master\r\nengineers of the entire North-Eastern District promptly assembled\r\nat Newcastle on April 8 to concert a united resistance to the men’s\r\ndemands. The operatives had first to form their organisation. Though\r\nNewcastle has since become one of the best centres of Trade Unionism,\r\nthe Amalgamated Society of Engineers could, in 1871, count only five\r\nor six hundred members in the town; the Boilermakers, Steam-Engine\r\nMakers, and Ironfounders were also weak, and probably two out of three\r\nof the men in the engineering trade belonged to no Union whatsoever. A\r\n“Nine Hours League,” embracing Unionists and non-Unionists alike, was\r\naccordingly formed for the special purpose of the agitation; and this\r\nbody was fortunate enough to elect as its President John Burnett,[460]\r\na leading member of the local branch of the Amalgamated Society,\r\nafterwards to become widely known as the General Secretary of that\r\ngreat organisation. The “Nine Hours League” became, in fact though\r\nnot in name, a temporary Trade Union, its committee conducting all\r\nthe negotiations on the men’s behalf, appealing to the Trade Union\r\nworld for funds for their support, and managing all the details of the\r\nconflict that ensued.[461]\r\n\r\nThe five months’ strike which led up to a signal victory for the men\r\nwas, in more than one respect, a notable event in Trade Union annals.\r\nThe success with which several thousands of unorganised workmen,\r\nunprovided with any accumulated funds, were marshalled and disciplined,\r\nand the ability displayed in the whole management of the dispute, made\r\nthe name of their leader celebrated throughout the world of labour.\r\nThe tactical skill and literary force with which the men’s case was\r\npresented achieved the unprecedented result of securing for their\r\ndemands the support of the _Times_[462] and the _Spectator_. Money was\r\nsubscribed slowly at first, but after three months poured in from all\r\nsides. Joseph Cowen, of the _Newcastle Daily Chronicle_, was from the\r\nfirst an ardent supporter of the men, and assisted them in many ways.\r\nThe employers in all parts of the kingdom took alarm; and a kind of\r\nlevy of a shilling for each man employed was made upon the engineering\r\nfirms in aid of the heavy expenses of the Newcastle masters. In spite\r\nof the active exertions of the “International,” several hundred foreign\r\nworkmen were imported; but many of these were subsequently induced to\r\ndesert.[463] Finally the employers conceded the principal of the men’s\r\ndemands; and fifty-four hours became the locally recognised week’s time\r\nin all the engineering trades.\r\n\r\nThis widely advertised success, coming at a time of expanding trade,\r\ngreatly promoted the movement for the Nine Hours Day. From one end of\r\nthe kingdom to the other, every little Trade Union branch discussed\r\nthe expediency of sending in notices to the employers. The engineering\r\ntrades in London, Manchester, and other great centres induced their\r\nemployers to grant their demands without a strike. The great army of\r\nworkmen engaged in the shipbuilding yards on the Clyde even bettered\r\nthis example, securing a fifty-one hours week. The building operatives\r\nquickly followed suit. Demands for a diminution of the working day,\r\nwith an increased rate of pay per hour, were handed in by local\r\nofficials of the Carpenters, Masons, Bricklayers, Plumbers, and other\r\norganisations. In many cases non-society men took the lead in the\r\nmovement; but it was soon found that the immediate success of the\r\napplications depended on the estimate formed by the employers of the\r\nmen’s financial resources, and their capacity to withhold their labour\r\nfor a time sufficient to cause embarrassment to business. Wherever the\r\nemployers were assured of this fact, they usually gave way without\r\na conflict. The successes accordingly did much to create, in the\r\nindustries in question, a preference for combination and collective\r\nbargaining as a means of improving the conditions of labour. The\r\nprevalence of systematic overtime, which has since proved so formidable\r\na deduction from the advantages gained by the Nine Hours Movement,\r\nwas either overlooked by sanguine officials, or covertly welcomed by\r\nindividual workmen as affording opportunities for working at a higher\r\nrate of remuneration.[464] On the other hand, it was a patent fact that\r\nthe mechanic employed in attending to the machinery of a textile mill\r\nwas the only member of his trade who was excluded from participation in\r\nthe shortening of hours enjoyed by his fellow-tradesmen; and that his\r\nfailure to secure a shorter day was an incidental consequence of the\r\nexistence of legislative restrictions. Thus, at the very time that the\r\ntextile operatives and coal-miners were, as we have seen, exhibiting\r\na marked tendency to look more and more to Parliamentary action for\r\nthe protection of the Standard of Life, the facts, as they presented\r\nthemselves to the Amalgamated Engineer or Carpenter, were leading the\r\nmembers of these trades to a diametrically opposite conclusion.\r\n\r\nBut though faith in trade combinations and collective bargaining was\r\nstrengthened by the success of the Nine Hours Movement, the victories\r\nof the men did not increase the prestige of the two great Amalgamated\r\nSocieties. The growing adhesion of the Junta to the economic views\r\nof their middle-class friends was marked by the silent abandonment\r\nby Allan, Applegarth, and Guile of all leadership in trade matters.\r\nAlready in 1865 we find the Executive Council of the Amalgamated\r\nEngineers explaining that, although they sympathised with advance\r\nmovements, they felt unable to either support them by grants or to\r\nadvise their members to vote a special levy.[465] The “backwardness\r\nof the Council of the Engineers” constantly provoked angry criticism.\r\nThe chief obstacles to advancement were declared to be Danter, the\r\nPresident of the Council, and the General Secretary, whose minds had\r\nbeen narrowed “by the routine of years of service within certain\r\nlimits.... Never, since it effected amalgamation, has the Society\r\nsolved one social problem; nor has it now an idea of future progress.\r\nIts money is unprofitably and injudiciously invested--even with a\r\nmiser’s care--while its councils are marked with all the chilly apathy\r\nof a worn-out mission.”[466] What proved to be the greatest trade\r\nmovement since 1852 was undertaken in spite of the official disapproval\r\nof the governing body, and was carried to a successful issue without\r\nthe provision from headquarters of any leadership or control. Though\r\nthe Nine Hours Strike actually began in Sunderland on April 1, 1871,\r\nthe London Executive remained silent on the subject until July.\r\nTowards the end of that month, when the Newcastle men had been out for\r\nseven weeks, a circular was issued inviting the branches to collect\r\nvoluntary subscriptions for their struggling brethren. Ultimately, in\r\nSeptember, the “Contingent Fund,” out of which strike pay is given,\r\nwas re-established by vote of the branches; and the strike allowance\r\nof 5s. per week, over and above the ordinary out-of-work pay, was\r\nissued, after fourteen weeks’ struggle, to the small minority of the\r\nmen on strike who were members of the Society. An emissary was sent\r\nto the Continent, at the Society’s expense, to defeat the employers’\r\nattempt to bring over foreign engineers; but with this exception all\r\nthe expenses of the struggle were defrayed from the subscriptions\r\ncollected by the Nine Hours League.[467] And if we turn for a moment\r\nfrom the Amalgamated Society of Engineers to the other great trade and\r\nfriendly societies of the time, it is easy, in the minutes of their\r\nExecutive Councils and the proceedings of their branches, to watch the\r\nsame tendency at work. Whether it is the Masons or the Tailors, the\r\nIronfounders or the Carpenters, we see the same abandonment by the\r\nCentral Executive of any dominant principle of trade policy, the same\r\nabsence of initiative in trade movements, and the same more or less\r\npersistent struggle to check the trade activity of its branches. In the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Carpenters, for example, we find, during these\r\nyears, no attempt by headquarters to “level up” the wages of low-paid\r\ndistricts, or to grapple with the problems of overtime or piecework. We\r\nwatch, on the contrary, the branches defending themselves before the\r\nExecutive for their little spurts of local activity, and pleading, in\r\norder to wring from a reluctant treasury the concession of strike pay,\r\nthat they have been dragged into the “Advance Movement” by the more\r\naggressive policy of the “General Union” (the rival trade society of\r\nthe old type), or by irresponsible “strike-committees” of non-society\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nTime and growth were, in fact, revealing the drawbacks of the\r\nconstitution with which Newton and Allan had endowed their cherished\r\namalgamation, and which had been so extensively copied by other\r\ntrades. The difficulties arising from the attempt to unite, in one\r\norganisation, men working in the numerous distinct branches of the\r\nengineering trade, demanded constant thought and attention. The rapid\r\nchanges in the industry, especially in connection with the growing use\r\nof new machinery, needed to be met by a well-considered flexibility,\r\ndictated by full knowledge of the facts, and some largeness of view. To\r\nmaintain a harmonious yet progressive trade policy in all the hundreds\r\nof branches would, of itself, have taxed the skill of a body of experts\r\nfree from other preoccupations. All these duties were, however, cast\r\nupon a single salaried officer,[468] working under a committee of\r\nartisans who met in the evening after an exhausting day of physical\r\ntoil.\r\n\r\nThe result might have been foreseen. The rapid growth of the society\r\nbrought with it a huge volume of detailed business. Every grant of\r\naccident benefit or superannuation allowance was made by the Executive\r\nCouncil. Every week this body had to decide on scores of separate\r\napplications for gifts from the Benevolent Fund. Every time any of the\r\ntens of thousands of members failed to get what he wanted from his\r\nbranch, he appealed to the Executive Council. Every month an extensive\r\ntrade report had to be issued. Every quarter the branch accounts had\r\nto be examined, dissected, and embodied in an elaborate summary,\r\nitself absorbing no small amount of labour and thought. The hundreds\r\nof branch secretaries and treasurers had to be constantly supervised,\r\nchecked by special audits, and perpetually admonished for negligent or\r\naccidental breaches of the complicated code by which the Society was\r\ngoverned. The Executive Council became, in fact, absorbed in purely\r\n“treasury” work, and spent a large part of its time in protecting the\r\nfunds of the Society from extravagance, laxity of administration, or\r\nmisappropriation. The quantity of routine soon became enormous; and the\r\nwhole attention of the General Secretary was given to coping with the\r\nmass of details which poured in upon him by every post.\r\n\r\nThis huge friendly society business brought with it, too, its special\r\nbias. Allan grew more and more devoted to the accumulating fund,\r\nwhich was alike the guarantee and the symbol of the success of his\r\norganisation. Nothing was important enough to warrant any inroad\r\non this sacred balance. The Engineers’ Central Executive, indeed,\r\npractically laid aside the weapon of the strike. “We believe,” said\r\nAllan before the Royal Commission in 1867, “that all strikes are a\r\ncomplete waste of money, not only in relation to the workmen, but\r\nalso to the employers.”[469] The “Contingent Fund,” out of which\r\nalone strike pay could be given, was between 1860 and 1872 repeatedly\r\nabolished by vote of the members, re-established for a short time,\r\nand again abolished. Trade Unionists who remembered the old conflicts\r\nviewed with surprise and alarm the spirit which had come over the once\r\nactive organisation. Even the experienced Dunning, whose moderation\r\nhad, as we have suggested, dictated the first manifesto in which the\r\nnew spirit can be traced, was moved to denunciation of Allan’s apathy.\r\n“As a Trade Union,” he writes in 1866, “the once powerful Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Engineers is now as incapable to engage in a strike as\r\nthe Hearts of Oak, the Foresters, or any other extensive benefit\r\nsociety.... It formerly combined both functions, but now it possesses\r\nonly one, that of a benefit society, with relief for members when out\r\nof work or travelling for employment superadded.... The Amalgamated\r\nEngineers, as a trade society, has ceased to exist.”[470]\r\n\r\nIt would be a mistake to assume that the inertia and supineness of the\r\n“Amalgamated” Societies was a necessary result of their accumulated\r\nfunds or their friendly benefits. The remarkable energy and success of\r\nthe United Society of Boilermakers and Iron-shipbuilders, established\r\nin 1832, and between 1865 and 1875 rapidly increasing in membership and\r\nfunds, shows that elaborate friendly benefits are not inconsistent with\r\na strong and consistent trade policy. This quite exceptional success\r\nis, we believe, due to the fact that the Boilermakers provided an\r\nadequate salaried staff to attend to their trade affairs. The “district\r\ndelegates” who were, between 1873 and 1889, appointed for every\r\nimportant district, are absolutely unconcerned with the administration\r\nof friendly benefits, and devote themselves exclusively to the work of\r\nCollective Bargaining. Unlike the General Secretaries of the Engineers,\r\nCarpenters, Stonemasons, or Ironfounders, who had but one salaried\r\nassistant, Robert Knight, the able secretary of the Boilermakers had\r\nunder his orders an expert professional staff, and was accordingly\r\nable, not only to keep both employers and unruly members in check, but\r\nalso successfully to adapt the Union policy to the changing conditions\r\nof the industry. In short, it was not the presence of friendly\r\nbenefits, but the absence of any such class of professional organisers\r\nas exists in the organisations of the Coal-miners, Cotton Operatives,\r\nand Boilermakers, that created the deadlock in the administration of\r\nthe great trade friendly societies.[471]\r\n\r\nThe direct result of this abnegation of trade leadership was a complete\r\narrest of the tendency to amalgamation, and, in some cases, even a\r\nbreaking away of sections already within the organisation. The various\r\nindependent societies, such as the Boilermakers, Steam-Engine Makers,\r\nand the Co-operative Smiths, gave up all idea of joining their larger\r\nrival. In 1872 the Patternmakers, who had long been discontented at\r\nthe neglect of their special trade interests, formed an organisation\r\nof their own, which has since competed with the Amalgamated for the\r\nallegiance of this exceptionally skilled class of engineers. Nor was\r\nAllan at all eager to make his organisation co-extensive with the\r\nwhole engineering industry. The dominant idea of the early years\r\nof the amalgamation--the protection of those who had, by regular\r\napprenticeship, acquired “a right to the trade”--excluded many men\r\nactually working at one branch or another, whilst the friendly society\r\nbias against unprofitable recruits co-operated to restrict the\r\nmembership to such sections of the engineering industry, and such\r\nmembers of each section, as could earn a minimum time wage fixed for\r\neach locality by the District Committee.\r\n\r\nThis exclusiveness necessarily led to the development of other\r\nsocieties, which accepted those workmen who were not eligible for\r\nthe larger organisation. The little local clubs of Machine-workers\r\nand Metal-planers expanded between 1867 and 1872 into national\r\norganisations, and began to claim consideration at the hands of\r\nthe better paid engineers, on whose heels they were treading. New\r\nsocieties, such as those of the National Society of Amalgamated\r\nBrass-workers, the Independent Order of Engineers and Machinists, and\r\nthe Amalgamated Society of Kitchen Range, Stove Grate, Gas Stoves,\r\nHot Water, Art Metal, and other Smiths and Fitters, sprang into\r\nexistence during 1872, in avowed protest against the “aristocratic”\r\nrule of excluding all workmen who were not receiving a high standard\r\nrate. The Associated Blacksmiths of Scotland, which had been formed\r\nin 1857 out of a class of smiths which was, at the time, unrecognised\r\nin the rules of the Amalgamated, now began steadily to increase in\r\nmembership. Finally, during the decade various local societies were\r\nrefused the privilege of amalgamation on the ground that either they\r\nincluded sections of the trade not recognised by the rules, or that the\r\naverage age of their constituents was such as to make them unprofitable\r\nmembers of a society giving heavy superannuation benefit. To the\r\ntendency to create an “aristocracy of labour” was added, therefore, the\r\nfastidiousness of an insurance company.\r\n\r\nMany causes were thus co-operating to shift the centre of Trade Union\r\ninfluence from London to the provinces. The great trade friendly\r\nsocieties of Engineers, Carpenters, and Ironfounders were losing\r\nthat lead in Trade Union matters which the political activity of\r\nthe Junta had acquired for them. The Junta itself was breaking up.\r\nApplegarth, in many respects the leader of the group, resigned his\r\nsecretaryship in 1871, and left the Trade Union Movement. Odger, who\r\nlived until 1877, was from 1870 onwards devoting himself more and\r\nmore to general politics. Allan, long suffering from an incurable\r\ndisease, died in 1874. Meanwhile provincial Trade Unionism was growing\r\napace. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers, so long pre-eminent in\r\nnumbers, began to be overshadowed by the federations of Coal-miners\r\nand Cotton Operatives. Even in the iron trades it found rivals in the\r\nrapidly growing organisations of Boilermakers (Iron-shipbuilders),\r\nwhose headquarters were at Newcastle, and the Ironworkers centred at\r\nDarlington, whilst minor engineering societies were cropping up in all\r\ndirections in the northern counties. The tendency to abandon London was\r\nfurther shown by the decision of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters\r\nin 1871 to remove their head office to Manchester, a change which had\r\nthe incidental effect of depriving the London leaders of the counsels\r\nof Applegarth’s successor, J. D. Prior, one of the ablest disciples of\r\nthe Junta.\r\n\r\nBut although London was losing its hold on the Trade Union Movement, no\r\nother town inherited the leadership. Manchester, it is true, attracted\r\nto itself the headquarters of many national societies, and contained in\r\nthese years perhaps the strongest group of Trade Union officials.[472]\r\nBut there was no such concentration of all the effective forces as had\r\nformerly resulted in the Junta. Though Manchester might have furnished\r\nthe nucleus of a Trade Union Cabinet, Alexander Macdonald was to be\r\nfound either in Glasgow or London, Robert Knight at Liverpool and\r\nafterwards in Newcastle, John Kane at Darlington, the miners’ agents\r\nall over the country, whilst Henry Broadhurst (who in 1875 succeeded\r\nGeorge Howell as the Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee),\r\nJohn Burnett, the General Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of\r\nEngineers, and George Shipton, the Secretary of the London Trades\r\nCouncil, naturally remained in the Metropolis. The result of the\r\nshifting from London was, accordingly, not the establishment elsewhere\r\nof any new executive centre of the Trade Union Movement, but the rise\r\nof a sectional spirit, the promotion of sectional interests, and the\r\nelaboration of sectional policies on the part of the different trades.\r\n\r\nWe have attempted in some detail to describe the internal growth of\r\nthe Trade Union Movement between 1867 and 1875, in order to enable\r\nthe reader to understand the disheartening collapse which ensued in\r\n1878-79, and the subsequent splitting up of the Trade Union world into\r\nthe hostile camps once more designated the Old Unionists and the New.\r\nBut all the unsatisfactory features of 1871-75 were, during these\r\nyears, submerged by a wave of extraordinary commercial prosperity and\r\nTrade Union expansion. The series of Parliamentary successes of 1871-75\r\nproduced, as we have seen, a feeling of triumphant elation among\r\nthe Trade Union leaders. To the little knot of working men who had\r\nconducted the struggle for emancipation and recognition, the progress\r\nof these years seemed almost beyond belief. In 1867 the officials of\r\nthe Unions were regarded as pothouse agitators, “unscrupulous men,\r\nleading a half idle life, fattening on the contributions of their\r\ndupes,” and maintaining, by violence and murder, a system of terrorism\r\nwhich was destructive, not only of the industry of the nation, but also\r\nof the prosperity and independence of character of the unfortunate\r\nworking men who were their victims. The Unionist workman, tramping with\r\nhis card in search of employment, was regarded by the constable and the\r\nmagistrate as something between a criminal vagrant and a revolutionist.\r\nIn 1875 the officials of the great societies found themselves elected\r\nto the local School Boards, and even to the House of Commons,\r\npressed by the Government to accept seats on Royal Commissions, and\r\nrespectfully listened to in the lobby. And these political results were\r\nbut the signs of an extraordinary expansion of the Trade Union Movement\r\nitself. “The year just closed,” says the report of the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee in January 1874, “has been unparalleled for the rapid growth\r\nand development of Trade Unionism. In almost every trade this appears\r\nto have been the same; but it is especially remarkable in those\r\nbranches of industry which have hitherto been but badly organised.”\r\nExact numerical details cannot now be ascertained; but the Trades Union\r\nCongress of 1872 claimed to represent only 375,000 organised workmen,\r\nwhilst that of 1874 included delegates from nearly three times as many\r\nsocieties, representing a nominal total of 1,191,922 members.[473] It\r\nis possible that between 1871 and 1875 the number of Trade Unionists\r\nwas more than doubled.\r\n\r\nWe see this progress reflected in the minds of the employers. At\r\nthe end of 1873 we find the newly established National Federation\r\nof Associated Employers of Labour declaring that “the voluntary and\r\nintermittent efforts of individual employers,” or even employers’\r\nassociations confined to a single trade or locality, are helpless\r\nagainst “the extraordinary development--far-reaching, but openly-avowed\r\ndesigns--and elaborate organisation of the Trade Unions.” “Few are\r\naware,” continues this manifesto, “of the extent, compactness of\r\norganisation, large resources, and great influence of the Trade\r\nUnions.... They have the control of enormous funds, which they expend\r\nfreely in furtherance of their objects; and the proportion of their\r\nearnings which the operatives devote to the service of their leaders\r\nis startling.... They have a well-paid and ample staff of leaders,\r\nmost of them experienced in the conduct of strikes, many of them\r\nskilful as organisers, all forming a class apart, a profession, with\r\ninterests distinct from, though not necessarily antagonistic to, those\r\nof the workpeople they lead, but from their very _raison d’être_\r\nhostile to those of the employers and the rest of the community....\r\nThey have, through their command of money, the imposing aspect of\r\ntheir organisation, and partly, also, from the mistaken humanitarian\r\naspirations of a certain number of literary men of good standing, a\r\nlarge army of literary talent which is _prompt_ in their service on\r\nall occasions of controversy. They have their own press as a field for\r\nthese exertions. Their writers have free access to some of the leading\r\nLondon journals. They organise frequent public meetings, at which paid\r\nspeakers inoculate the working classes with their ideas, and urge them\r\nto dictate terms to candidates for Parliament. Thus they exercise a\r\npressure upon members of Parliament, and those aspirant to that honour,\r\nout of all proportion to their real power, and beyond belief except to\r\nthose who have had the opportunity of witnessing its effects. They have\r\na standing Parliamentary Committee, and a programme; and active members\r\nof Parliament are energetic in their service. They have the attentive\r\near of the Ministry of the day; and their communications are received\r\nwith instant and respectful attention. They have a large representation\r\nof their own body in London whenever Parliament is likely to be\r\nengaged in the discussion of the proposals they have caused to be\r\nbrought before it. Thus, untrammelled by pecuniary considerations,\r\nand specially set apart for this peculiar work, without other\r\nclashing occupations, they resemble the staff of a well-organised,\r\nwell-provisioned army, for which everything that foresight and\r\npreoccupation in a given purpose could provide, is at command.”[474] It\r\nis not surprising that the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union\r\nCongress, composed, as it was, of the “staff of leaders” referred to,\r\nshould have had this involuntary tribute to their efficiency reprinted\r\nand widely circulated among their constituents.\r\n\r\nThe student will form a more qualified estimate of the position\r\nin 1873-75 than either the elated Trade Unionists or the alarmed\r\nemployers. In the first place, great as was the numerical expansion of\r\nthese years, the reader of the preceding chapters will know that it was\r\nnot without parallel. The outburst of Trade Unionism between 1830 and\r\n1834 was, so far as we can estimate, even greater than that between\r\n1871 and 1875, whilst it was far more rapid in its development. There\r\nwere, during the nineteenth century, three high tides in the Trade\r\nUnion history of our country, 1833-34, 1872-74, and 1889-90. In the\r\nabsence of complete and trustworthy statistics it is difficult to say\r\nat which of these dates the sweeping in of members was greatest. But it\r\nis easy to discern that the expansion of 1873-74 was marked by features\r\nwhich were both like and unlike those of its predecessor.\r\n\r\nLike the outburst of 1833-34, the marked extension of Trade Unionism\r\nin 1872 reached even the agricultural labourers. For more than thirty\r\nyears since the transportation of the Dorchester labourers good\r\ntimes and bad had passed over their heads without resulting in any\r\ncombined effort to improve their condition. There seems to have been a\r\nshort-lived combination in Scotland in 1865. We hear of an impulsive\r\nstrike of some Buckinghamshire labourers in 1867, which spread into\r\nHertfordshire. A more effective Union was formed in Herefordshire in\r\n1871, which pursued a quiet policy of emigration, and enrolled 30,000\r\nsubscribers in half a dozen counties. But a more energetic movement\r\nnow arose. On February 7, 1872, the labourers of certain parishes of\r\nWarwickshire met at Wellesbourne to discuss their grievances. At a\r\nsecond meeting, a little later, Joseph Arch, a labourer of Barford, who\r\nowned a freehold cottage, and had become known as a Primitive Methodist\r\npreacher, made a speech which bore fruit. On the 11th of March two\r\nhundred men resolved to strike for higher wages, namely, 16s. per\r\nweek for a working day from 6 A.M. to 5 P.M. Unlike most strikes this\r\none attracted from the first the favourable notice of the press.[475]\r\nPublicity brought immediate funds and sympathisers. On the 29th of\r\nMarch the inaugural meeting of the Warwickshire Agricultural Labourers’\r\nUnion was held at Leamington, under the presidency of the Hon. Auberon\r\nHerbert, M.P., a donation of one hundred pounds being handed in by a\r\nrich friend. Through the eloquence, the revivalist fervour, and the\r\nuntiring energy of Joseph Arch, the movement spread like wildfire among\r\nthe rural labourers of the central and eastern counties. The mania\r\nfor combination which came over the country population during the next\r\nfew months recalls, indeed, the mushroom growth of the Grand National\r\nConsolidated Trades Union of forty years before. Within two months\r\ndelegates from twenty-six counties met to transform the local society\r\ninto a National Agricultural Labourers’ Union, organised in district\r\nUnions all over the country, with a central committee at Leamington,\r\nwhich, by the end of the year, boasted of a membership of nearly a\r\nhundred thousand.[476]\r\n\r\nThe organised Trade Unions rallied promptly to the support of the\r\nlabourers, and contributed largely to their funds. The farmers met the\r\nmen’s demand by a widespread lock-out of Unionist labourers, which\r\ncalled forth the support of Trades Councils and individual societies\r\nall over the country.[477] George Howell, then Secretary of the\r\nParliamentary Committee, George Shipton, the Secretary of the newly\r\nrevived London Trades Council, and many other leaders, gave up their\r\nnights and days to perfecting the labourers’ organisations. The skilled\r\ntrades, indeed, furnished many of the officials of the new Union.\r\nJoseph Arch found for his headquarters an able general secretary in\r\nHenry Taylor, a carpenter, whilst the Kentish labourers, organised\r\nin the separate Kent Union, enjoyed the services of a compositor.\r\nThis help, together with the funds and countenance of influential\r\nphilanthropists, made the outburst less transient than that of 1833-34.\r\nIn many villages the mere formation of a branch led to an instantaneous\r\nrise of wages. But, as in 1833-34, the audacity of the field labourer\r\nin imitating the combinations of the town artisan provoked an almost\r\nindescribable bitterness of feeling on the part of the squirearchy\r\nand their connections. The farmers, wherever they dared, ruthlessly\r\n“victimised” any man who joined the Union. It is needless to say that\r\nthey received the cordial support of the rural magistracy. In aid of\r\na lock-out near Chipping Norton, two justices, who happened both to\r\nbe clergymen, sent sixteen labourers’ wives, some with infants at\r\nthe breast, to prison with hard labour, for “intimidating” certain\r\nnon-Union men. An attempt to punish the leaders of a meeting at\r\nFarringdon, on the ground of “obstruction of the highway,” was only\r\ndefeated by bringing down an eminent Queen’s Counsel from London to\r\noverawe the local bench. The “dukes”--notably those of Marlborough\r\nand Rutland--denounced the “agitators and declaimers” who had “too\r\neasily succeeded in disturbing the friendly feeling which used to unite\r\nthe labourer and his employer in mutual feelings of generosity and\r\nconfidence.” Innumerable acts of petty tyranny and oppression proved\r\nhow far the landed interest had lagged behind the capitalist employers\r\nin the matter of Freedom of Combination. Nor was the Established Church\r\nmore sympathetic. At the great meeting held at Exeter Hall on behalf\r\nof the labourers, when the chair was taken by Samuel Morley, M.P.,\r\nthe only ecclesiastic who appeared on the platform was Archbishop\r\n(afterwards Cardinal) Manning. In fact, the spirit in which the\r\nrural clergy viewed this social upheaval is not unfairly typified\r\nby the public utterance of a learned bishop. On September 2, 1872,\r\nDr. Ellicott, the Bishop of Gloucester, speaking at a meeting of the\r\nGloucester Agricultural Society, significantly suggested the village\r\nhorsepond as a fit destination for the “agitators,” or delegates sent\r\nby the Union to open new branches. And the farmers, the squires, and\r\nthe Church were supported by the army. When the labourers in August\r\n1872 struck for an increase of wages, the officers, in Oxfordshire and\r\nBerkshire, placed the soldiers at the disposal of the farmers for the\r\npurpose of getting in the harvest and so defeating the Union.\r\n\r\nThis insurrection of the village and the autocratic spirit which it\r\naroused in the owners of land and tithe had, we believe, a far-reaching\r\npolitical effect. With its results upon the agitation for Church\r\ndisestablishment and the growing Radicalism of the counties we are not\r\nhere concerned. We trace, however, from these months, the appearance\r\nin the Trade Union programme of the proposals relating to the Land Law\r\nReform and the Summary Jurisdiction of the Magistrates, which seem,\r\nat first sight, unconnected with the grievances of the town artisan.\r\nBut though the agricultural labourer had his effect upon the Trade\r\nUnion Movement, Trade Unionism was not, at this time, able to do much\r\nfor him. Funds and personal help were freely placed at his service\r\nby his brother Unionists. The minute-books and balance-sheets of the\r\ngreat Unions and the Trade Councils show how warm and generous was the\r\nresponse made to his appeal by the engineers, carpenters, miners, and\r\nother trades. The London Trades Council successfully exerted itself\r\nto stop the lending of troops to the farmers, and procured a fresh\r\nregulation explicitly prohibiting for the future such assistance “in\r\ncases where strikes or disputes between farmers and their labourers\r\nexist.”[478] The public disapproval of the sentence in the Chipping\r\nNorton case was used by the Trade Union leaders as a powerful argument\r\nfor the repeal of the Criminal Law Amendment Act.\r\n\r\nBut all this availed the agricultural labourer little. The feverish\r\nfaith in combination as a panacea for all social ills gradually\r\nsubsided. The farmers, after their first surprise, during which the\r\nlabourers, in many counties, secured advances of from eighteenpence\r\nto as much as four shillings per week, met the Union demands and\r\nsuccesses by a stolid resistance, and took every opportunity to regain\r\ntheir ground. In 1874 the Agricultural Unions sustained their first\r\nsevere defeat. Some of those in Suffolk asked for an advance of wages\r\nfrom 13s. to 14s. for a 54-hours week. The farmers’ answer was an\r\nimmediate lock-out, which was rapidly taken up throughout the Eastern\r\nand Midland counties, no fewer than 10,000 members of the Union being\r\nthus “victimised.” The struggle had to be closed in July 1874, after an\r\nexpenditure by the National Union of £21,365 in strike pay. After this\r\nthe membership rapidly declined. Every winter saw the lock-out used\r\nas a means for smashing particular branches of the Union. And in this\r\nwork of destruction the farmers were aided by their personal intimacy\r\nwith the labourer. It was easy to drop into the suspicious mind of the\r\nuneducated villager a fatal doubt as to the real destination of the\r\npennies which he was sending away to the far-off central treasury. Nor\r\nwas the Union organisation perfect. Difficulties and delays occurred in\r\nrendering aid to threatened branches or victimised men. The clergyman,\r\nthe doctor, and the village publican were always at hand to encourage\r\ndistrust of the “paid agitator.” Within a very few years most of the\r\nindependent Unions had ceased to exist, whilst Arch’s great national\r\nsociety had dwindled away to a steadily diminishing membership,\r\nscattered up and down the midland counties, in what were virtually\r\nvillage sick and funeral clubs. With the decline of prosperity of\r\nBritish farming, which set in about 1876-77, men were everywhere\r\ndismissed, grass replaced grain over hundreds of thousands of acres,\r\nand the demand for agricultural labour fell off; and even Joseph Arch\r\nhad repeatedly to advise the local branches to acquiesce in lower\r\nwages. By 1881 the National Union could claim only 15,000 members, and\r\nin 1889 only 4254.[479]\r\n\r\nWe have, therefore, in the sudden growth and quick collapse of this\r\nrevolt “of the field” a marked likeness to the meteoric career of\r\nthe general Trades Unions of 1833-34. But the expansion of the\r\nTrade Union Movement in 1871-75 had another point of resemblance to\r\nprevious periods of inflation. In 1871-75, as in 1833-34 and in 1852,\r\nthe project of recovering possession of the instruments of production\r\nseizes hold of the imagination of great bodies of Trade Unionists.\r\nAgain we see attempts by trade organisations to establish workshops\r\nof their own. The schemes of Co-operative Production of 1871-75 bore\r\nmore resemblance to those of 1852 than to Owen’s crude communism. In\r\nthe Trade Unionism of 1833-34 the fundamental Trade Union principle of\r\nthe maintenance of the Standard of Life was overshadowed and absorbed\r\nby the Owenite idea of carrying on the whole industry of the country\r\nby national associations of producers, in which all the workmen would\r\nbe included. But in the more practical times of 1852 and 1871-75 the\r\nproject of “self-employment” remained strictly subordinate to the main\r\nfunctions of the organisation.[480] Whatever visions may have been\r\nindulged in by individual philanthropists, the Trade Union committees\r\nof both these periods treated the co-operative workshop either as\r\nmerely a convenient adjunct to the Union, or as a means of affording to\r\na certain number of its members a chance of escape from the conditions\r\nof wage-labour.[481] The failure of all these attempts belongs,\r\ntherefore, rather to the history of Co-operation than to that of Trade\r\nUnionism. For our present purpose it suffices to note that the loss\r\nin these experiments of tens of thousands of pounds finally convinced\r\nthe officials of the old-established Unions of the impracticability of\r\nusing Trade Union organisations and Trade Union funds for Co-operative\r\nProduction. The management of industry by associations of producers\r\nstill remains the ideal of one school of co-operators, and still\r\nperiodically captures the imagination of individual Trade Unionists.\r\nBut other ideals of collective ownership of the means of production\r\nhave displaced the Owenism of 1833-34 and the “Christian Socialism”\r\nof 1852. Of co-operative experiments by Trade Societies, in their\r\ncorporate capacity, we hear practically no more.[482]\r\n\r\nOn the whole the contrast between the Trade Union expansion of\r\n1873-74 and that of 1833-34 is more significant than any likeness\r\nthat may be traced between the two periods. The Trade Unionists of\r\n1833-34 aimed at nothing less than the supersession of the capitalist\r\nemployer; and they were met by his absolute refusal to tolerate,\r\nor even to recognise, their organisation. The new feature of the\r\nexpansion of 1873-74 was the moderation with which the workmen claimed\r\nmerely to receive some share of the enormous profits of these good\r\ntimes. The employers, on the other hand, for the most part abandoned\r\ntheir objection to recognise the Unions, and even conceded, after\r\nrepeated refusals, the principle of the regulation of industry by\r\nJoint Boards of Conciliation or impartial umpires chosen from outside\r\nthe trade. From 1867 to 1875 innumerable Boards of Conciliation and\r\nArbitration were established, at which representatives of the masters\r\nmet representatives of the Trade Unions on equal terms. In fact, it\r\nmust have been difficult for the workmen at this period to realise\r\nwith what stubborn obstinacy the employers, between 1850 and 1870, had\r\nresisted any kind of intervention in what they had then regarded as\r\nessentially a matter of private concern. When the Amalgamated Society\r\nof Engineers offered, in 1851, to refer the then pending dispute to\r\narbitration, the master engineers simply ignored the proposal. The\r\nSelect Committees of the House of Commons in 1856 and 1860 found\r\nthe workmen’s witnesses strongly in favour of arbitration, but the\r\nemployers sceptical as to its possibility. Nor did the establishment\r\nof A. J. Mundella’s Hosiery Board at Nottingham in 1860, and Sir\r\nRupert Kettle’s Joint Committees in the Wolverhampton building trades\r\nin 1864, succeed in converting the employers elsewhere. But between\r\n1869 and 1875 opinion among the captains of industry, to the great\r\nsatisfaction of the Trade Union leaders, gradually veered round.\r\n“Twenty-five years ago,” said Alexander Macdonald in 1875, “when we\r\nproposed the adoption of the principle of arbitration, we were then\r\nlaughed to scorn by the employing interests. But no movement has ever\r\nspread so rapidly or taken a deeper root than that which we then set\r\non foot. Look at the glorious state of things in England and Wales. In\r\nNorthumberland the men now meet with their employers around the common\r\nboard.... In Durhamshire a Board of Arbitration and Conciliation has\r\nalso been formed; and 75,000 men repose with perfect confidence on the\r\ndecisions of the Board. There are 40,000 men in Yorkshire in the same\r\nposition.”[483]\r\n\r\nBut though the establishment, from 1869 onwards, of Joint Boards and\r\nJoint Committees represented a notable advance for the Trade Unions,\r\nand marked their complete recognition by the great employers, yet this\r\nvictory brought results which largely neutralised its advantages.[484]\r\nAs in the case of the political triumphs, the men gained their point\r\nat the cost of adopting the intellectual position of their opponents.\r\nWhen the representatives of the employers and the delegates of the\r\nmen began to meet to discuss the future scale of wages, we see the\r\nsturdy leaders of many Trade Union battles gradually and insensibly\r\naccepting the capitalists’ axiom that wages must necessarily fluctuate\r\naccording to the capitalists’ profits, and even with every variation\r\nof market-prices.[485] At Darlington, for instance, we watch the\r\nshrewd leader of the employers, David Dale, succeeding in completely\r\nimpressing John Kane and a whole subsequent generation of ironworkers\r\nwith a firm belief in the principle of regulating wages according to\r\nthe market price of the product. The high prices of 1870-73 removed\r\nthe last scruples of the workmen as to the new doctrine. In 1874 a\r\ndelegate meeting of the Northumberland Miners decided to use the\r\nformal expression of the Executive Committee,[486] “that prices should\r\nrule wages”--a decision expressly repeated by delegate meetings in\r\n1877 and 1878. In 1879, when prices had come tumbling down, we find\r\nthe Executive still maintaining that “as an Association we have\r\nalways contended that wages should be based on the selling price of\r\ncoal.”[487] In an interesting letter dated February 1, 1878, Burt,\r\nNixon, and Young (then the salaried officers of the Northumberland\r\nMiners), in describing the negotiations for a Sliding Scale, take\r\noccasion to mention that they had agreed with the employers that there\r\nshould be no Minimum Wage.[488] And though the practical difficulties\r\ninvolved in the establishment of automatic wage-adjustments hindered\r\nthe spread of Sliding Scales to other industries, the principle\r\nbecame tacitly accepted among whole sections of Trade Unionists.\r\nThe compulsory maintenance, in good times and bad, of the workman’s\r\nStandard of Life was thus gradually replaced by faith in a scale of\r\nwages sliding up and down according to the commercial speculations of\r\nthe controllers of the market.\r\n\r\nThe new doctrine was not accepted without vigorous protests from the\r\nmore thoughtful working-men leaders. Lloyd Jones, writing in 1874,\r\nwarns “working men of the danger there is in a principle that wages\r\nshould be regulated by market prices, accepted and acted on, and\r\ntherefore presumably approved of by Trades Unions. These bodies, it is\r\nto be regretted, permit it in arbitration, accept it in negotiations\r\nwith their employers, and thus give the highest sanction they can to\r\na mode of action most detrimental to the cause of labour.... The first\r\nthing, therefore, those who manage trade societies should settle is a\r\nminimum, which they should regard as a point below which they should\r\nnever go.... Such a one as will secure sufficiency of food and some\r\ndegree of personal and home comfort to the worker; not a miserable\r\nallowance to starve on, but living wages.... The present agreements\r\nthey are going into on fluctuating market prices is a practical placing\r\nof their fate in the hands of others. It is throwing the bread of their\r\nchildren into a scramble of competition where everything is decided by\r\nthe blind and selfish struggles of their employers.”[489] “I entirely\r\nagree,” writes Professor Beesly, “with an admirable article by Mr.\r\nLloyd Jones[490] in a recent number of the _Beehive_, in which he\r\nmaintained that colliers should aim at establishing a minimum price for\r\ntheir labour, and compelling their employers to take that into account\r\nas the one constant and stable element in all their speculations. All\r\nworkmen should keep their eyes fixed on this ultimate ideal.”[491]\r\n\r\nNor was this view confined to friendly allies of the Trade Union\r\nMovement. We shall have occasion to notice how forcibly both the Cotton\r\nOperatives and the Boilermakers protested against the dependence of\r\nwages on the fluctuations of the market. Alexander Macdonald himself,\r\nthough he approved of Joint Committees, instinctively maintained\r\nan attitude of hostility to the innovating principle of a sliding\r\nscale.[492] And, as we shall hereafter see, the conflict between\r\nMacdonald’s teaching with regard to both wages and the hours of labour,\r\nand the economic views of the Northumberland and Durham leaders,\r\npresently divided the organised miners into two hostile camps.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Union world of 1871-75 was therefore more complicated, and\r\npresented many more difficult internal problems than was imagined,\r\neither by the alarmed employers or the triumphant Trade Unionists. It\r\nneeded only the stress of hard times to reveal to the Trade Unionists\r\nthemselves that they were not the compact and well-organised army\r\ndescribed by the National Federation of Associated Employers, but\r\na congeries of distinct sections, pursuing separate and sometimes\r\nantagonistic policies.\r\n\r\nThe expansion of trade, under the influence of which Trade Unionism,\r\nas we have seen, reached in 1873-74 one of its high-water marks,\r\ncame suddenly to an end. The contraction became visible first in the\r\ncoal and iron industries, those in which the inflation had perhaps\r\nbeen greatest.[493] The first break occurred in February 1874, when\r\nthe coal-miners of the East of Scotland submitted to a reduction of\r\na shilling a day. During the rest of the year prices and wages came\r\ntumbling down in both these staple trades. In January 1875 a furious\r\nconflict broke out in South Wales, where many thousand miners and\r\nironworkers refused to submit to a third reduction of ten per cent.\r\nThe struggle dragged on until the end of May, when work was resumed\r\nat a reduction, not of ten, but of twelve and a half per cent, with\r\nan understanding that “any change in the wage rates ... shall depend\r\non a sliding scale of wages to be regulated by the selling price of\r\ncoal.”[494] In the following year the depression spread to the textile\r\nindustries, and gradually affected all trades throughout the country.\r\nThe building trades were, however, still prosperous; and the Manchester\r\nCarpenters chose this moment for an aggressive advance movement. The\r\ndisastrous strike that followed early in 1877, and lasted throughout\r\nthe year, resulted in the virtual collapse of the General Union of\r\nCarpenters and Joiners, at that time the third in magnitude among the\r\nsocieties in the building trades, and left the Manchester building\r\noperatives in a state of disorganisation from which they never fully\r\nrecovered. In April 1877 the Clyde shipwrights demanded an increase\r\nof wages, to which the employers replied by a general lock-out of all\r\nthe operatives engaged in the shipbuilding yards, in the expectation\r\nthat this would cause pressure on the shipwrights to withdraw their\r\nclaim. For more than three months the main industry of the Clyde was at\r\na standstill, the dispute being eventually ended, in September 1877,\r\nby submission to the arbitration of Lord Moncrieff, in which the men\r\nwere completely worsted. In July 1877 a conflict broke out between the\r\nstonemasons and their employers, in which Bull & Co., the contractors\r\nfor the new law courts in London, caused the bitterest resentment\r\nby importing German workmen as blacklegs. The demand had originally\r\nbeen for an increase of wages and reduction of hours for the London\r\nmen; but as the obstinate struggle progressed it became, in effect, a\r\nbattle between the Stonemasons’ Union and the federated master builders\r\nthroughout the country. Large levies were raised, and over £2000\r\ncollected from other trade societies; but in March 1878, after eight\r\nmonths’ conflict, the remnant of the strikers returned to work on the\r\nemployers’ terms. The cotton trade, too, was made the scene of one\r\nof the greatest industrial struggles on record. After several minor\r\nreductions of wages during 1877, which resulted in local strikes, in\r\nMarch 1878, as the _Times_ reports, “all the way through a centre of 70\r\nmiles, where 250,000 cotton operatives are employed, notices have been\r\nposted giving a month’s notice of ten per cent reduction in wages.”\r\nA colossal strike ensued, which brought into prominence the rival\r\ntheories of the cotton operatives and their employers. It was conceded\r\nby the men that the millowners were losing money, and that some change\r\nhad to be made. But as the employers admitted that their losses\r\narose from the glutted state of the market, the operatives contended\r\nthat the proper remedy was the cessation of the over-production;\r\nand they therefore offered to accept the 10 per cent reduction on\r\ncondition that the mills should only work four days a week. A heated\r\ncontroversy ensued, but the millowners persisted in their demand for\r\nthe unconditional surrender of the men, and refused all proposals for\r\narbitration. The cause of the men was unfortunately prejudiced by\r\nserious riots at Blackburn, at which the house of Colonel Raynsford\r\nJackson, the leader of the associated employers, was looted and burnt.\r\nAfter ten weeks’ struggle the men went in on the employers’ terms.[495]\r\n\r\nThe great struggles of 1875-78 were only the precursors of a general\r\nrout of the Trade Union forces. The increasing depression of trade\r\nculminated during 1878-79 in a stagnation which must rank as one\r\nof the most serious which has ever overtaken British industry. The\r\nparalysis of business was intensified, especially in Scotland, by the\r\nwidespread ruin caused by the failure of the City of Glasgow Bank.\r\nFrom one end of the kingdom to the other great firms became bankrupt,\r\nmines and ironworks were stopped, ships lay idle in the ports, and a\r\nuniversal feeling of despondency and distrust spread like a blight\r\ninto every corner of the industrial world. Every industry had its\r\ncrowds of unemployed workmen, the proportion of men on the books of\r\nthe Trade Unions rising, in some cases, to as much as 25 per cent. The\r\ncapitalists, as might have been expected, chose the moment of trial for\r\nattempting to take back the rest of the concessions extorted from them\r\nin the previous years. “It has appeared to employers of labour,” stated\r\nthe private circular issued by the Iron Trade Employers’ Association\r\nin December 1878, “that the time has arrived when the superfluous\r\nwages which have been dissipated in unproductive consumption must be\r\nretrenched, and when the idle hours which have been unprofitably thrown\r\naway must be reclaimed to industry and profit by being redirected\r\nto reproductive work.” The result is reflected in the Trade Union\r\nreports. “All over the United Kingdom,” states the Monthly Report of\r\nthe Amalgamated Carpenters for January 1879, “notices of reductions in\r\nwages and extended hours of labour come pouring in from employers with\r\nan eagerness and audacity which contrast strangely with the lessons of\r\nforbearance and moderation so incessantly dinned into the ears of the\r\nBritish workman in happier times.” “At no time in our history,” reports\r\nthe Executive Council of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, “have we\r\nhad such a number of industrial disturbances throughout the country.\r\nBad trade has prevailed; and our employers, now better organised than\r\never before, seem to have made it their aim to raise as many points of\r\ncontention with us as ever possible. In one place sweeping reductions\r\nof wages would be carried out or attempted; and in others the rates\r\npaid for overtime were sought to be reduced, while in many cases\r\nthe hours of labour have been attacked, and in the Clyde district\r\nsuccessfully, three hours being, as a result, added to the week’s work\r\nall over Scotland.... Another notable feature of the depression has\r\nbeen the continued oppression by the employers of the men in the most\r\nsubmissive districts, where conciliatory measures were adopted, and\r\nwhere little objection was made to any innovation. The Clyde district\r\nhas been a notable example of this fact, passing in the first instance\r\nthrough two considerable reductions of wages almost passively, only\r\nto be almost immediately after the victims of desultory attacks upon\r\nthe hours question. Irregular attack appears almost to have been the\r\nsystem adopted by the employers in preference to the development of\r\nany general movement by their Associations.”[496] The years 1878-1880\r\nwitnessed, accordingly, a great increase in the number of strikes in\r\nnearly all trades,[497] most of which terminated disastrously for the\r\nworkmen. Sweeping reductions of wages occurred in all industries. The\r\nNorthumberland miners, whose normal day’s earnings had been 9s. 1½d.\r\nin March 1873, found themselves reduced, in November 1878, to 4s. 9d.\r\nper day, and in January 1880 to 4s. 4d. Scotch mechanics suffered an\r\neven more sudden reduction. The Glasgow stonemasons, for instance, who\r\nhad been earning 9d. and 10d. per hour during 1877, dropped by the end\r\nof 1878 to 6d. per hour, and found it difficult to find employment\r\neven at that figure. A still more dangerous encroachment was made in\r\nconnection with the hours of labour. Employers on all sides sought to\r\nlengthen the working day. The mechanics on the Clyde lost the fifty-one\r\nhours week which they had won. The Iron Trades Employers’ Association,\r\nwhose circular we have quoted, resolved upon a general attack on the\r\nNine Hours Day. “It has been resolved,” writes the secretary, “by a\r\nlarge majority of the Iron Trades Employers’ Association, supported\r\nby a general agreement among other employers, to give notice in their\r\nworkshops that the hours of labour shall be increased to the number\r\nprevailing before the adoption of the nine hours limit.”[498] The\r\nconcerted action of the associated employers was, however, baulked by\r\nthe energy of John Burnett, then General Secretary of the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Engineers. Placed in possession of the Circular for a couple\r\nof hours, he promptly reproduced it in an ably reasoned appeal to his\r\nown members, which was sent broadcast to the press. Publicity proved\r\nfatal to the employers’ plans, and no uniform or systematic action was\r\ntaken. Isolated attempts were, however, made in all directions by the\r\nmaster engineers to revert to fifty-seven or fifty-nine hours per week;\r\nand only by the most strenuous action was the normal fifty-four-hours\r\nweek retained in “society shops.”\r\n\r\nOther trades were not equally successful in maintaining even their\r\nnominal day. In many towns the carpenters had two or three hours per\r\nweek added to their working time.[499] More serious was the fact\r\nthat in numerous minor trades the very conception of a definitely\r\nfixed normal day was practically lost. Even among such well-organised\r\ntrades as the Engineers, Carpenters, and Stonemasons the practice of\r\nsystematic overtime, coupled with the prevalence of piecework, reduced\r\nthe normal day to a nullity.[500] In the abundant Trade Union records\r\nof these years we watch the progress and results of these economic\r\ndisasters. The number of men drawing the out-of-work benefit steadily\r\nrises, until the societies of Ironfounders and Boilermakers, which\r\nin 1872-73 had scarcely 1 per cent unemployed, had in 1879 over 20\r\nper cent on their funds. The Amalgamated Society of Engineers paid\r\naway, under this one head, during the three years 1878-80, a sum of\r\nno less than £287,596. The Operative Plumbers had to exclude, in the\r\ntwo years 1880-82, nearly a third of their members for non-payment of\r\ncontributions. The Ironfounders, who in 1876 had accumulated a fund of\r\nover £5 per member, paid away every penny of it by the end of 1879,\r\nand were only saved from actual stoppage by the numerous loans made to\r\nthe society by its more prosperous members. The Stonemasons’ Society\r\ndrained itself equally dry, and resorted to the same expedient to avoid\r\ndefault. The Scottish societies had to meet the crisis in an even more\r\naggravated form. The total collapse which followed the City of Glasgow\r\nBank failure absolutely ruined all but half a dozen of the Scotch Trade\r\nUnions, a blow from which Trade Unionism in Scotland did not recover\r\nfor the rest of the century.\r\n\r\nThe year 1879, indeed, was as distinctly a low-water mark of the Trade\r\nUnion Movement as 1873-74 registered a full tide of prosperity. The\r\neconomic trials through which Trade Unionism passed in 1879 are only\r\nto be paralleled by those through which it had gone in 1839-42. But\r\nthe solid growth which we have described prevented any such total\r\ncollapse as marked the previous periods. The depression of 1879\r\nswept, it is true, many hundreds of trade societies into oblivion.\r\nThe Unions of agricultural labourers, which had sprung up with such\r\nmushroom rapidity, either collapsed altogether or dwindled into\r\ninsignificant benefit clubs. Up and down the country the hundreds of\r\nlittle societies in miscellaneous trades which had flourished during\r\nthe good years, went down before the tide of adversity. Widespread\r\nnational organisations shrank up practically into societies of local\r\ninfluence, concentrated upon the strongholds of their industries.\r\nThe great National Union of Miners, established, as we have seen, in\r\n1862-63, survived, after 1879, only in Northumberland, Durham, and\r\nYorkshire. Its younger rival, the Amalgamated Association of Miners,\r\nwhich had, up to 1875, dominated South Wales and the Midlands, broke up\r\nand disappeared. The National Amalgamated Association of Ironworkers,\r\nalso established in 1862, which in 1873 numbered 35,000 members in all\r\nparts of the country, was reduced in 1879 to 1400 members, confined\r\nto a few centres in the North of England.[501] In some districts, such\r\nas South Wales, Trade Unionism practically ceased to exist.[502] The\r\ntotal membership of the Trade Union Movement returned, it is probable,\r\nto the level of 1871. But despite all these contractions the backbone\r\nof the movement remained intact. In the engineering and building trades\r\nthe great national societies, though they were denuded of their reserve\r\nfunds, retained their membership. Nor was it only the trade friendly\r\nsocieties that weathered the storm. The essentially trade organisations\r\nof the cotton operatives, and of the Northumberland and Durham miners,\r\nmaintained their position with only a temporary contraction of\r\nmembership. The political organisation of the movement was, moreover,\r\nunaffected. The local Trades Councils went on undisturbed. The annual\r\nTrades Union Congress continued to meet, and to appoint its standing\r\nParliamentary Committee. In short, though many individual Unions\r\ndisappeared, and many others saw their balances absorbed and their\r\nmembership reduced, the trials of 1879 proved that the Trade Union\r\nMovement was at last beyond all danger of destruction or collapse, and\r\nthat the Trade Union organisation had become a permanent element in our\r\nsocial structure.\r\n\r\nWe see, therefore, that the work which Allan and Applegarth had done\r\ntowards consolidating the Trade Union Movement had not been fruitless.\r\nBut along with increasing consolidation and definiteness of purpose\r\nhad come an increasing differentiation of policy and interest. Each\r\ntrade was working out its own industrial problems in its way. Whilst\r\nthe miners and the cotton operatives, for instance, were elaborating\r\ntheir own codes of legislative regulation of the conditions of labour,\r\nthe engineering and building trades were becoming pledged to the\r\nlegislative _laissez-faire_ of their leaders. Under the influence\r\nof the able spokesmen of the northern counties the coal-miners and\r\nironworkers were accepting the principle that wages must follow prices;\r\nwhilst the cotton operatives, and to some extent the boilermakers,[503]\r\nwere making a notable stand for the contrary view that the Standard\r\nRate of Wages should be a first charge on industry. And while the\r\nminers and cotton operatives regarded their organisations primarily\r\nas societies for trade protection, there was growing up among the\r\nsuccessors of the Junta in the iron and building trades a fixed belief\r\nthat the really “Scientific Trade Unionism” consisted in elaborate\r\nfriendly benefits and judiciously invested superannuation funds. So\r\nlong as trade was expanding, and each policy was pursued with success,\r\nno antagonism arose between the different sections. The cotton\r\noperatives cordially approved the Nine Hours Movement of the engineers,\r\nwhilst these, in their turn, supported the Factory Bill desired by the\r\nLancashire spinners. The miners applauded the gallant stand made by the\r\ncotton operatives against the reductions of 1877-79, whilst the cotton\r\noperatives saw no objection to the acquiescence of the miners in the\r\ndependence of wages on prices. And though all Trade Unions regarded\r\nwith respect the high contributions and accumulated funds of the\r\nAmalgamated Engineers, they were equally respectful of the success with\r\nwhich the Northumberland coal-miners, through bad times and good, had\r\nfor half a generation maintained a strong Union with exclusively trade\r\nobjects. Thus the divergences of policy, which were destined from 1885\r\nonward to form the battle-ground between what has been once more termed\r\nthe “Old” Unionism and the “New,” did not at first prevent cordial\r\nco-operation in the common purposes of the Trade Union Movement. It was\r\nin the dark days after 1878-79, when every Union suffered reverses,\r\nthat internal discontent as to Trade Union policy became acute, and\r\na new spirit of criticism arose. Not until the purely trade society,\r\non the one hand, had been found lacking in stability, and the trade\r\nfriendly society, on the other, had been convicted of apathy in trade\r\nmatters; not until the Lancashire and Yorkshire coalminers had been\r\ndriven to protest against the constant reductions brought about by\r\nthe sliding scales, and some of the leaders of the Lancashire cotton\r\noperatives hesitated in their advocacy of the legal day; finally, not\r\nuntil a powerful section of the miners opposed any further extension of\r\nthe Mines Regulation Acts, and a section of the engineers and building\r\noperatives began to advocate the legal fixing of their own labour\r\nday--do we find it declared that “the two systems cannot co-exist; they\r\nare contradictory and opposed.”[504]\r\n\r\nIn more than one direction, therefore, the depression of trade was\r\nbringing into prominence wide divergences of opinion upon Trade\r\nUnion policy. But the adverse industrial circumstances of the time\r\nwere revealing, in certain industries, a more invidious cleavage.\r\nAs manufacturing processes develop and change with the progress of\r\ninvention and the substitution of one material for another--iron\r\nfor wood in shipbuilding, for instance--the skilled members of one\r\ntrade find themselves superseded for certain work by the members of\r\nanother. A modern Atlantic liner, practically a luxuriously-fitted,\r\nelectric-lighted floating hotel, built of rolled steel plates,\r\nwould obviously not fall within the work of a shipwright like Peter\r\nthe Great. But the old-fashioned shipwright naturally refused to\r\nrelinquish without a struggle the right to build ships of every\r\nkind. The depression of 1879 was severely felt in the shipbuilding\r\nand engineering trades, every one of which had a large percentage of\r\nits members unemployed. The societies found, as we have seen, the\r\nout-of-work donation a serious drain on their funds, and were inclined\r\nto look more narrowly into cases of “encroachment” upon the work which\r\neach regarded as the legitimate sphere of its own members. Disputes\r\nbetween Union and Union as to overlap and apportionment of work become,\r\nin these years, of frequent occurrence; and to the standing conflict\r\nwith the employers was added embittered internecine warfare between\r\nthe men of one branch of trade and those of another. The Engineers\r\ncomplained of the monopoly which the Boilermakers maintained of all\r\nwork connected with angle-iron. The Patternmakers protested vigorously\r\nagainst the Carpenters presuming to make any engineering patterns.\r\nAt Glasgow the Brassfounders objected to the Ironmoulders continuing\r\nto make the large brass castings which the workers in brass had at\r\nfirst been unable to undertake. The line of demarcation in iron\r\nshipbuilding between the work of a shipwright and that of a boilermaker\r\nwas a constant source of friction. The disregard of the ordinary\r\nclassification of trades by the authorities of the Royal Dockyards\r\ncreated great discontent among the Engineers, who saw shipwrights\r\nput to do fitters’ work, and Broadhurst brought the matter in 1882\r\nbefore the House of Commons.[505] Nor were the disputes confined to\r\nthe puzzling question of the lines of demarcation between particular\r\ntrades. In 1877 the recently formed Union of “Platers’ Helpers”\r\ncomplained bitterly to the Trades Union Congress that the whole\r\nforce of the Boilermakers’ Society had been used to destroy their\r\norganisation. The Platers’ Helpers, it may be explained, constitute\r\na large class of labourers in shipbuilding yards, who are usually\r\nemployed and paid, not by the owners of the yards, but by members of\r\nthe Boilermakers’ Society. In the building trades numerous cases of\r\nfriction were occurring between bricklayers and masons on the one\r\nhand, and the builders’ labourers on the other. The introduction of\r\nterra cotta led to a whole series of disputes between the bricklayers\r\nand the plasterers as to the trade to which the new work properly\r\nbelonged. Disputes of this kind were, of course, no new thing. What\r\ngave the matter its new importance was the dominance of the great trade\r\nfriendly societies in the skilled occupations. The loss of employment\r\nby individual members became in bad times a serious financial drain on\r\nUnions giving out-of-work pay. In place of the bickerings of individual\r\nworkmen we have the conflicts of powerful societies, each supporting\r\nthe claim of its own members to do the work in dispute. “When men are\r\nnot organised in a Trade Union,” says the general secretary of a large\r\nsociety, “these little things are not taken much notice of, but the\r\nmoment the two trades become well organised, each trade is looking\r\nafter its own particular members’ interests....”[506]\r\n\r\nWe have in our _Industrial Democracy_ analysed the history, character,\r\nand extent of this rivalry among competing branches of the same\r\ntrade. Here we need do no more than record its result in weakening\r\nthe bond of union between powerful sections of the Trade Union world.\r\nThe local Trades Councils, which might have attained a position\r\nof political influence, were always being disintegrated by the\r\ndisputes of competing trades. The powerful Shipping Trades Council\r\nof Liverpool, for instance, which played an important part in Samuel\r\nPlimsoll’s agitation for a new Merchant Shipping Act, was broken up in\r\n1880 by the quarrel between the separate societies of Shipwrights,\r\nShip-joiners, and House Carpenters over ship work. The minutes of\r\nevery Trades Council, especially those in seaports, relate innumerable\r\nwell-intentioned attempts to settle similar disputes, almost invariably\r\nending in the secession of one or other of the contending Unions.\r\nThese quarrels prevented, moreover, the formation of any effective\r\ngeneral federation. An attempt was made in 1875 by the officers of the\r\nAmalgamated Engineers’, Boilermakers’, Ironfounders’, and Steam-Engine\r\nMakers’ Societies to establish a federation for mutual defence against\r\nattacks upon the Nine Hours System. After a few months, the disputes\r\nbetween the Engineers and Boilermakers on the one hand, and between the\r\nmembers of the Amalgamated Society and the Steam-Engine Makers’ Society\r\non the other, led to the abandonment of the attempt.[507] A similar\r\nmovement initiated by the Boilermakers in 1881 equally failed to get\r\nestablished.[508]\r\n\r\nWider federations met with no better success than those confined to\r\nthe engineering and shipbuilding trades. The Trades Union Congress\r\nrepeatedly declared itself in favour of universal brotherhood among\r\nTrade Unionists, and the formation of a federal bond between the\r\ndifferent societies. But the inherent differences between trade and\r\ntrade, the numerous distinct types into which societies were divided,\r\nthe wide divergences as to Trade Union policy which we have been\r\ndescribing, and, above all, the rivalry for members and employment\r\nbetween competing societies in the same industry, rendered any\r\nuniversal federation impossible. After the Sheffield Congress in\r\n1874, representatives of the leading Unions in the iron and building\r\ntrades set on foot a “Federation of Organised Trade Societies,”\r\nwhich all Unions were invited to join for mutual defence. But the\r\nCotton-spinners, with their preference for legislative regulation,\r\nrefused to have anything to do with a federation which contemplated\r\nnothing but strike benefits. The whole scheme was, indeed, more a\r\nproject of certain Trade Union officials than a manifestation of any\r\ngeneral feeling in favour of common action. Each trade was, as we have\r\nsaid, working out its own policy, and attending almost exclusively to\r\nits own interests. Under such circumstances any attempt at effective\r\nfederation must necessarily have been still-born. Nevertheless the\r\nEdinburgh Congress of 1879 called for a renewed attempt; and the\r\nParliamentary Committee circulated to every Trade Union in the\r\nkingdom their proposed rules for another “Federation of Organised\r\nTrade Societies,” To this invitation not half a dozen replies were\r\nreceived.[509] At the Congress of 1882, when the resolution in favour\r\nof a universal federation was again proposed, it found little support.\r\nThe representatives of the local Trades Councils urged that these\r\nbodies furnished all that was practicable in the way of federation.\r\nThomas Ashton, the outspoken representative of the cotton-spinners,\r\nwas more emphatic. “For years,” he said, “the Parliamentary Committee\r\nand others had been trying to bring about such an organisation as\r\nthat mentioned in the resolution, but it had been found utterly\r\nimpossible.... It was all nonsense to pass such a resolution. It was\r\nimpossible for the trades of the country to amalgamate, their interests\r\nwere so varied and they were so jealous with regard to each other’s\r\ndisputes.”[510]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing examination of the internal relations of the Trade Union\r\nworld between 1875 and 1879, though incomplete, demonstrates the extent\r\nto which the movement during these years was dominated by a somewhat\r\nnarrow “particularism.” From 1880 to 1885 the various societies were\r\nabsorbed in building up again their membership and balances, which\r\nhad so seriously suffered during the continued depression. The annual\r\nTrades Union Congress, the Parliamentary Committee, and the political\r\nproceedings of these years constitute practically the only common bond\r\nbetween the isolated and often hostile sections. In all industrial\r\nmatters the Trade Union world was broken up into struggling groups,\r\ndestitute of any common purpose, each, indeed, mainly preoccupied with\r\nits separate concerns, and frequently running counter to the policy or\r\naims of the rest. The cleavages of interest and opinion among working\r\nmen proved to be deeper and more numerous than any one suspected. In\r\nthe following chapter we shall see how an imperfect appreciation of\r\neach other’s position led to that conflict between the “Old Unionists”\r\nand the “New” which for some years bade fair to disintegrate the whole\r\nLabour Movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[442] Address of Alexander Macdonald to the Leeds Conference, 1873.\r\nAlexander Macdonald, the son of a sailor, who became a miner in\r\nLanarkshire, was born at Airdrie in 1821, and went to work in the pit\r\nat the age of eight. Having an ardent desire for education he prepared\r\nhimself as best he could for Glasgow University, which he entered in\r\n1846, supporting himself from his savings, and from his work as a\r\nminer in the summer. Whilst still at the University he became known\r\nas a leader of the miners all over Scotland. In 1850 he became a mine\r\nmanager, and in 1851 he opened a school at Airdrie, an occupation which\r\nhe abandoned in 1855 to devote his whole time to agitation on behalf\r\nof the miners. On the formation, in 1863, of the National Union of\r\nMiners, he was elected president, a position which he retained until\r\nhis death. Meanwhile he was, by a series of successful commercial\r\nspeculations, acquiring a modest fortune, which enabled him to devote\r\nhis whole energies to the promotion of the Parliamentary programme\r\nwhich he had impressed upon the miners. He gave important evidence\r\nbefore the Select Committee of 1865 on the Master and Servant Law. In\r\n1868 he offered himself as a candidate for the Kilmarnock Burghs, but\r\nretired to avoid a split. At the General Election of 1874 he was more\r\nsuccessful, being returned for Stafford, and thus becoming (with Thomas\r\nBurt) the first “Labour Member.” He was shortly afterwards appointed\r\na member of the Royal Commission on the Labour Laws, and eventually\r\npresented a minority report of his own on the subject. He died in 1881.\r\nA history of the coal-miners which he projected was apparently never\r\nwritten, and, with the exception of numerous presidential addresses and\r\nother speeches, and a pamphlet entitled _Notes and Annotations on the\r\nCoal Mines Regulation Act, 1872_ (Glasgow, 1872, 50 pp.), we have found\r\nnothing from his pen. A eulogistic notice of his life by Lloyd Jones\r\nappeared in the _Newcastle Chronicle_, November 17, 1883, most of which\r\nis reprinted in Dr. Baernreither’s _English Associations of Working\r\nMen_, p. 408.\r\n\r\n[443] Address to the Miners’ National Conference at Leeds, 1873.\r\n\r\n[444] The Conference appointed a sub-committee to compile and publish\r\nits proceedings, “a thing,” as the preface explains, “altogether\r\nunparalleled in the records of labour.” And indeed the elaborate\r\nvolume, regularly published by the eminent firm of Longmans in 1864,\r\nentitled _Transactions and Results of the National Association of Coal,\r\nLime, and Ironstone Miners of Great Britain, held at Leeds, November\r\n9, 10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, 1863_, with its 174 pages, its frontispiece\r\nrepresenting the pit-brow women, and its motto on the title-page\r\nextracted from the writings of W. E. Gladstone, formed a creditable and\r\nimpressive appeal to the reading public.\r\n\r\n[445] For this militant Chartist (1805-79), see _Life of Joseph Rayner\r\nStephens_, by G. J. Holyoake, 1881.\r\n\r\n[446] _Transactions and Results of the National Association of Coal,\r\nLime, and Ironstone Miners of Great Britain, held at Leeds, November 9,\r\n10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, 1863_, p. 14.\r\n\r\n[447] _Transactions and Results of the National Association of Coal,\r\nLime, and Ironstone Miners of Great Britain, held at Leeds, November 9,\r\n10, 11, 12, 13, and 14, 1863_, p. 17. In Northumberland and Durham the\r\nhewers very largely work in two shifts, whilst there used to be only\r\none shift of boys.\r\n\r\n[448] Section 29 of Mines Regulation Act of 1860.\r\n\r\n[449] Normansell _v._ Platt. John Normansell, the agent of the South\r\nYorkshire Miners’ Association, stands second only to Macdonald as a\r\nleader of the miners between 1863 and 1875. The son of a banksman,\r\nhe was born at Torkington, Cheshire, in 1830, and left an orphan at\r\nan early age. At seven he entered the pit, and when, at the age of\r\nnineteen, he married, he was unable to write his own name. Migrating\r\nto South Yorkshire, he became a leader in the agitation to secure a\r\ncheckweigher, which the local coal-owners conceded in 1859. Normansell\r\nwas elected to the post for his own pit, and rapidly became the leading\r\nspirit in the district. After the lock-out of 1864 he was elected\r\nsecretary to the Union, then counting only two thousand members. Within\r\neight years he had raised its membership to twenty thousand, and built\r\nup an elaborate system of friendly benefits. Normansell was the first\r\nworking-man Town Councillor, having been triumphantly elected at\r\nBarnsley, his Union subscribing £1000 to lodge in the bank in his name,\r\nin order to enable him to declare himself possessed of the pecuniary\r\nqualification at that time required. On his death the amount was voted\r\nto his widow. Normansell gave evidence in 1867 before the Select\r\nCommittee on Coal-mining, and before that on the Master and Servant\r\nLaw, in 1868 before the Royal Commission on Trade Unions, and in 1873\r\nbefore that on the Coal Supply.\r\n\r\n[450] The best and indeed the only exact account of these cotton lists\r\nis that prepared for the Economic Section of the British Association by\r\na committee consisting of Professor Sidgwick, Professor Foxwell, A. H.\r\nD. (now Sir Arthur) Acland, Dr. W. Cunningham, and Professor J. E. C.\r\nMunro, the report being drawn up by the latter.

Wood, 1910; _A Century\r\nof Fine Cotton Spinning_, by McConnel & Co., 1906; and _Standard Piece\r\nLists and Sliding Scales_, by the Labour Department of the Board of\r\nTrade, Cd. 144, 1900.\r\n\r\nThe principles upon which the lists are framed are so complicated that\r\nwe confess, after prolonged study, to be still perplexed on certain\r\npoints; and though Professor Munro clears up many difficulties, we are\r\ndisposed to believe that even he, in some particulars, has not in all\r\ncases correctly stated the matter. We have discussed the whole subject\r\nin our _Industrial Democracy_.\r\n\r\n[451] _Bolton and District Net List of Prices for Spinning Twist,\r\nReeled Yarn or Bastard Twist, and Weft, on Self-actor Mules_ (Bolton,\r\n1887; 85 pp.).\r\n\r\n[452] Birtwistle was, in 1892, at an advanced age, appointed by the\r\nHome Secretary an Inspector in the Factory Department, under the\r\n“particulars clause” (sec. 24 of the Factory and Workshops Act, 1891),\r\nas the only person who could be found competent to understand and\r\ninterpret the intricacies of the method of remuneration in the weaving\r\ntrade.\r\n\r\n[453] _Beehive_, February 23, 1867.

(died 1919), then secretary of the Oldham\r\nSpinners, often made this statement. On the 26th of May 1893 the\r\n_Cotton Factory Times_, the men’s accredited organ, declared, with\r\nreference to the Eight Hours Movement, that “now the veil must be\r\nlifted, and the agitation carried on under its true colours. Women and\r\nchildren must no longer be made the pretext for securing a reduction of\r\nworking hours for men.”\r\n\r\n[457] Speech at Trades Union Congress, Bristol, 1878.\r\n\r\n[458] “From what I have heard,” writes Professor Beesly in the\r\n_Beehive_, May 16, 1874, “I am inclined to think that no single fact\r\nhad more to do with the defeat of the Liberal Party in Lancashire at\r\nthe last election than Mr. Fawcett’s speech on the Nine Hours Bill in\r\nthe late Parliament.”\r\n\r\n[459] Report of Trades Union Congress, Sheffield, January 1874.\r\n\r\n[460] John Burnett, who was born at Alnwick, Northumberland, in 1842,\r\nbecame, after the Nine Hours Strike, a lecturer for the National\r\nEducation League, and joined the staff of the _Newcastle Chronicle_.\r\nIn 1875, on Allan’s death, he was elected to the General Secretaryship\r\nof the Amalgamated Society of Engineers. He was a member of the\r\nParliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress from 1876 to\r\n1885. In 1886 he was appointed to the newly-created post of Labour\r\nCorrespondent of the Board of Trade, in which capacity he prepared\r\nand issued a series of reports on Trade Unions and Strikes. On the\r\nestablishment of the Labour Department in 1893 he became Chief Labour\r\nCorrespondent under the Commissioner for Labour, and was selected to\r\nvisit the United States to prepare a report on the effects of Jewish\r\nimmigration. He retired in 1907 and died 1914.\r\n\r\n[461] A full account of this conflict is given by John Burnett in\r\nhis _History of the Engineers’ Strike in Newcastle and Gateshead_\r\n(Newcastle, 1872; 77 pp.). A description by the Executive of the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Engineers is given in their “Abstract Report”\r\nup to December 31, 1872. The _Newcastle Daily Chronicle_, from April\r\nto October 1871, furnishes a detailed contemporary record. The leading\r\narticles and correspondence in the _Times_ of September 1871 are\r\nimportant.\r\n\r\n[462] See the _Times_ leader of September 11, 1871. This leader, which\r\npronounced “the conduct of the employers throughout this dispute as\r\nimprudent and impolitic,” called forth the bewildered remonstrance of\r\nSir William (afterwards Lord) Armstrong, writing on behalf of “the\r\nAssociated Employers.” “We were amazed,” writes the great captain of\r\nindustry, “to see ourselves described in your article as being in a\r\ncondition of hopeless difficulty; and we really felt that, if the\r\nLeague themselves had possessed the power of inspiring that article,\r\nthey could scarcely have used words more calculated to serve their\r\npurposes than those in which it is expressed. The concurrent appearance\r\nin the _Spectator_ of an article exhibiting the same bias adds to our\r\nsurprise. We had imagined that a determined effort to wrest concessions\r\nfrom employers by sheer force of combination was not a thing which\r\nfound favour with the more educated and intelligent classes, whose\r\nopinions generally find expression in the columns of the _Times_”\r\n(_Times_ September 14, 1871).\r\n\r\n[463] Here the “International” was of use. At Burnett’s instigation,\r\nCohn, the Danish secretary in London, proceeded to the Continent to\r\ncheck this immigration, his expenses being paid by the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Engineers.\r\n\r\n[464] With regard to overtime, Burnett informed us that “it was found\r\nimpossible to carry a Nine Hours Day pure and simple at the time of the\r\nstrike of 1871, and that overtime should still be worked as required\r\nwas insisted upon as a first condition of settlement by the employers.”\r\n\r\n[465] Meeting of London pattern-makers to seek advance of wages,\r\n_Beehive_, October 21, 1865.\r\n\r\n[466] Letter from “Amalgamator,” _Beehive_, January 19, 1867.\r\n\r\n[467] The rank and file were more sympathetic than the Executive.\r\nThe machinery for making the collections was mostly furnished by the\r\nbranches and committees of the Society.\r\n\r\n[468] An “Assistant Secretary” was subsequently added, and eventually\r\nanother. But these assistants were, like the General Secretary himself,\r\nrecruited from the ranks of the workmen, and however experienced they\r\nmay have been in trade matters, were necessarily less adapted to the\r\nclerical labour demanded of them. The great Trade Friendly Societies of\r\nthe Stonemasons, Bricklayers, and Ironfounders long continued to have\r\nonly one assistant secretary, and no clerical staff whatever.\r\n\r\n[469] Question 827 in Report of Trade Union Commission (March 26, 1867).\r\n\r\n[470] _Bookbinders’ Trade Circular_, January 1866.\r\n\r\n[471] In 1892 the Amalgamated Engineers provided themselves, not only\r\nwith district delegates, like those of the Boilermakers, but also with\r\na salaried Executive Council. The Amalgamated Society of Carpenters\r\nhas since started district delegates, and the other national societies\r\ngradually followed suit.\r\n\r\n[472] Mention should here be made of the Manchester and District\r\nAssociation of Trade Union Officials, an organisation which grew out\r\nof a joint committee formed to assist the South Wales miners in their\r\nstrike of 1875. The frequent meetings, half serious, half social,\r\nof this grandly named association, known to the initiated as “the\r\nPeculiar People,” served for many years as opportunities for important\r\nconsultations on Trade Union policy between the leaders of the numerous\r\nsocieties having offices in Manchester. It also had as an object the\r\nprotection of Trade Union officials against unjust treatment by their\r\nown societies (see _History of the British Trades Union Congress_, by\r\nW. J.

This Federation\r\ncomprised in its ranks a large proportion of the great “captains of\r\nindustry” of the time, including such shipbuilders as Laird and Harland\r\n& Wolff; such textile manufacturers as Crossley, Brinton, Marshall,\r\nTitus Salt, Akroyd, and Brocklehurst; such engineers as Mawdsley, Son &\r\nField, Combe, Barbour & Combe, and Beyer & Peacock; such ironmasters as\r\nDavid Dale and John Menelaus; such builders as Trollope of London and\r\nNeill of Manchester, and such representatives of the great industrial\r\npeers as Sir James Ramsden, who spoke for the Duke of Devonshire, and\r\nFisher Smith, the agent of the Earl of Dudley.\r\n\r\n[475] The immediate publicity given to the agitation was due, in the\r\nfirst place, to the sympathy of J. E. Matthew Vincent, the editor of\r\nthe _Leamington Chronicle_, and secondly, to the instinct of the _Daily\r\nNews_, which promptly sent Archibald Forbes, its war correspondent,\r\nto Warwickshire, and “boomed” the movement in a series of special\r\narticles. A contemporary account of the previous career of Joseph\r\nArch is given by the Rev. F. S. Attenborough in his _Life of Joseph\r\nArch_ (Leamington, 1872; 37 pp.).

Considerable jealousy was\r\nshown of any centralising policy, and eventually a Federal Union of\r\nAgricultural and General Labourers was formed by half a dozen of the\r\nsmaller societies, with an aggregate membership of 50,000.\r\n\r\n[477] The Birmingham Trades Council, for instance, issued the following\r\nposter:\r\n\r\n“Great Lock-out of Agricultural Labourers!\r\n\r\n“An Appeal. Is the Labourer worthy of his Hire?\r\n\r\n“This question is to all lovers of freedom and peaceful progress,\r\nand it is left for them to say whether that spark of life and hope\r\nwhich has been kindled in the breasts of our toiling brothers in the\r\nagricultural districts shall be extinguished by the pressure of the\r\npresent lock-out. The answer is No! and the echo resounds from ten\r\nthousand lips. But let us be practical; a little help is of more\r\nvalue than much sympathy; we must not stand to pity, but strive to\r\nsend relief. The cause of the agricultural labourer is our own;\r\nthe interests of labour in all its forms are very closely bound up\r\ntogether, and the simple question for each one is, How much can I help,\r\nand how soon can I do it? If we stay thinking too long, action may\r\ncome too late; these men, our brethren, now deeply in adversity, may\r\nhave fallen victims when our active efforts might have saved them. The\r\nstrain upon the funds of their Union must be considerable with such\r\na number thrown into unwilling idleness, and that for simply asking\r\nthat their wages, in these times of dear food, might be increased from\r\n13s. to 14s. per week. Money is no doubt wanted, and it is by that\r\nalone the victory can be won. Let us therefore hope that Birmingham\r\nwill once again come to the rescue, determined to assist these men to\r\na successful resistance of the oppression that is attempted in this\r\nlock-out.\r\n\r\n“The great high priest and deliverer of this people now seeks our\r\naid. We must not let him appeal to us in vain; his efforts have been\r\ntoo noble in the past, the cause for which he pleads is too full of\r\nrighteousness, and the issues too great to be passed by in heedless\r\nsilence. Let us all to work at once. We can all give a little, and each\r\none may encourage his neighbour to follow his example. The conflict\r\nmay be a severe one. It is for freedom and liberty to unite as we have\r\ndone. We have reaped some of the advantages of our Unions; we must\r\nassist them to establish theirs, and not allow the ray of hope that now\r\nshines across the path of our patient but determined fellow-toilers\r\nto be darkened by the blind folly of their employers, who, being in a\r\nmeasure slaves to the powers above them, would, if they could, even\r\nat their own loss, consign all below them to perpetual bondage. This\r\nmust not be. We must not allow these men to be robbed of their right to\r\nunite, or their future may be less hopeful than their past. Let some\r\none in every manufactory and workshop collect from those disposed to\r\ngive, and so help to furnish the means to assist these men to withstand\r\nthe powers brought against them, showing to their would-be oppressors\r\nthat we have almost learned the need and duty of standing side by side\r\nuntil all our righteous efforts shall be crowned by victory.\r\n\r\n\r\n“All members of the Birmingham Trades Council are authorised to collect\r\nand receive contributions to the fund, and will be pleased to receive\r\nassistance from others.\r\n\r\n                            “By order of the Birmingham Trades Council,\r\n                                              “W. Gilliver, Secretary.”\r\n\r\n\r\n[478] _Queen’s Regulations for the Army for 1873_, Article 180; the\r\nwhole correspondence is given in the Report of the London Trades\r\nCouncil, June 1873.\r\n\r\n[479] The rival Kent Union, which had become the Kent and Sussex\r\nAgricultural and General Labourers’ Union, enrolling all sorts of\r\nlabourers, claimed in 1889 still to have 10,000 members, with an annual\r\nincome of £10,000 a year, mostly disbursed in sick and funeral benefits.\r\n\r\n[480] See _Die Strikes, die Co-operation, die Industrial Partnerships_,\r\nby Dr. Robert Jannasch (Berlin, 1868; 66 pp.).\r\n\r\n[481] Amid the great outburst of feeling in favour of Co-operative\r\nProduction it is difficult to distinguish in every case between the\r\ninvestments of the funds of the Trade Unions in their corporate\r\ncapacity, and the subscriptions of individual members under the\r\nauspices, and sometimes through the agency, of their trade society. The\r\nSouth Yorkshire Miners’ Association used £30,000 of its funds in the\r\npurchase of the Shirland Colliery in 1875, and worked it on account of\r\nthe Association. In a very short time, however, the constant loss on\r\nthe working led to the colliery being disposed of, with the total loss\r\nof the investment. The Northumberland and Durham Miners in 1873 formed\r\na “Co-operative Mining Company” to buy a colliery, a venture in which\r\nthe Unions took shares, but which quickly ended in the loss of all the\r\ncapital. Some of the Newcastle engineers on strike for Nine Hours in\r\n1871 were assisted by sympathisers to start the Ouseburn Engine Works,\r\nwhich came to a disastrous end in 1876. In 1875 the Leicester Hosiery\r\nOperatives’ Union, having 2000 members, began manufacturing on its own\r\naccount, and bought up a small business. In the following year a vote\r\nof the members decided against such an investment of the funds, and\r\nthe Union sold out to a group of individuals under the style of the\r\nLeicester Hosiery Society. It became fairly successful, but scarcely\r\na tenth of the shareholders were workers in the concern, and it was\r\neventually merged in the Co-operative Wholesale Society. Innumerable\r\nsmaller experiments were set on foot during these years by groups of\r\nTrade Unionists with more or less assistance from their societies,\r\nbut the great majority were quickly abandoned as unsuccessful. In a\r\nfew cases the business established still exists, but in every one of\r\nthese any connection with Trade Unionism has long since ceased. In\r\nlater years renewed attempts have been made by a few Unions. Several\r\nlocal branches of the National Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives, for\r\ninstance, have taken shares in the Leicester Co-operative Boot and\r\nShoe Manufacturing Society. The London Bassdressers, the Staffordshire\r\nPotters, the Birmingham Tinplate Workers, and a few other societies\r\nhave also taken shares in co-operative concerns started in their\r\nrespective trades. Full particulars will be found in the exhaustive\r\nwork of Benjamin Jones on _Co-operative Production_, 1894.\r\n\r\n[482] In one other respect the Trade Union expansion of 1872-74\r\nresembled that of 1833-34. Both periods were marked by an attempt\r\nto enrol the women wage-earners in the Trade Union ranks. Ephemeral\r\nUnions of women workers had been established from time to time, only to\r\ncollapse after a brief existence. The year 1872 saw the establishment\r\nof the oldest durable Union for women only--the Edinburgh Upholsterers’\r\nSewers’ Society. Two years later Mrs. Paterson, the real pioneer of\r\nmodern women’s Trade Unions, began her work in this field, and in 1875\r\nseveral small Unions among London Women Bookbinders, Upholsteresses,\r\nShirt and Collar Makers, and Dressmakers were established, to\r\nbe followed, in subsequent years, by others among Tailoresses,\r\nLaundresses, etc. Mrs. Emma Ann Paterson (_née_ Smith), who was born\r\nin 1848, the daughter of a London schoolmaster, served from 1867 to\r\n1873 successively as an Assistant Secretary of the Working Men’s Club\r\nand Institute Union and the Women’s Suffrage Association, and married,\r\nin 1873, Thomas Paterson, a cabinetmaker. On a visit to the United\r\nStates she became acquainted with the “Female Umbrella Makers’ Union\r\nof New York,” and strove, on her return in 1874, to promulgate the\r\nidea of Trade Unionism among women workers in the South of England.\r\nAfter some newspaper articles, she set on foot the Women’s Protective\r\nand Provident League (now the Women’s Trade Union League), for the\r\nexpress purpose of promoting Trade Unionism, and established in the\r\nsame year the National Union of Working Women at Bristol. From 1875 to\r\n1886 she was a constant attendant at the Trades Union Congress, and\r\nwas several times nominated for a seat on the Parliamentary Committee,\r\nat the Hull Congress heading the list of unsuccessful candidates. An\r\nappreciative notice of her life and work appeared in the _Women’s\r\nUnion Journal_ on her death in December 1886; see also _Dictionary of\r\nNational Biography_, and _Women in the Printing Trades_, edited by J.\r\nR. MacDonald (1904), pp. 36, 37.\r\n\r\n[483] Speech quoted in _Capital and Labour_; June 16, 1875.\r\n\r\n[484] It must be remembered that the words “arbitration” and\r\n“conciliation” were at this time very loosely used, often meaning no\r\nmore than a meeting of employers and Trade Union representatives for\r\nargument and discussion. The classic work upon the whole subject is\r\nHenry Crompton’s _Industrial Conciliation_, 1876. It receives detailed\r\nexamination in the various contributions of Mr. L. L. Price, notably\r\nhis _Industrial Peace_ (1887) and the supplementary papers entitled\r\n“The Relations between Industrial Conciliation and Social Reform,” and\r\n“The Position and Prospects of Industrial Conciliation,” published\r\nin the _Statistical Society’s Journal_ for June and September 1890\r\n(vol. liii. pp. 290 and 420). For an American summary may be consulted\r\nJoseph D. Weeks’ _Report on the Practical Working of Arbitration and\r\nConciliation in the Settlement of Differences between Employers and\r\nEmployees in England_ (Harrisburg, 1879), and his paper on _Labour\r\nDifferences_ (New York, 1886). The working of arbitration is well set\r\nforth in _Strikes and Arbitration_, by Sir Rupert Kettle, 1866; in A.\r\nJ. Mundella’s evidence before the Trade Union Commission, 1868; in his\r\naddress, _Arbitration as a Means of Preventing Strikes_ (Bradford,\r\n1868; 24 pp.); and in the lecture by Dr. R. Spence Watson entitled\r\n“Boards of Arbitration and Conciliation and Sliding Scales,” reported\r\nin the _Barnsley Chronicle_, March 20, 1886. An early account of\r\nthe Nottingham experience is contained in the paper by E. Renals,\r\n“On Arbitration in the Hosiery Trades of the Midland Counties”\r\n(_Statistical Society’s Journal_, December 1867, vol. xxx. p. 548).\r\nSee also the volume edited by Dr. Brentano, _Arbeitseinstellungen und\r\nFortbildung des Arbeitvertrags_ (Leipzig, 1890), and _Zum socialen\r\nFrieden_, by Dr. von Schulze Gaevernitz (Leipzig, 2 vols., 1892). The\r\nwhole subject of the relation between Trade Unions and employers is\r\nfully dealt with in our _Industrial Democracy_. For the latest British\r\nOfficial reports on the subject see Cd. 6603, 6952, and 9099.\r\n\r\n[485] The course of prices after 1870 demonstrates how disastrously\r\nthis principle would have operated for the wage-earners had it been\r\nuniversally adopted. Between 1870 and 1894 the Index Number compiled by\r\nthe _Economist_, representing the average level of market prices, fell\r\nsteadily from 2996 to 2082, irrespective of the goodness of trade or\r\nthe amount of the employers’ profits. Any exact correspondence between\r\nwages and the price of the product would exclude the wage-earners, as\r\nsuch, from all share in the advantages of improvements in production,\r\ncheapening of carriage, and the fall in the rate of interest, which\r\nmight otherwise be turned to account in an advance in the workman’s\r\nStandard of Life. On the other hand, in an era of rising prices,\r\nwhen these influences are being more than counteracted by currency\r\ninflation, increasing difficulty of production, or a world-shortage of\r\nsupply, an automatic correspondence between money wages and the cost\r\nof living would be useful, if it did not lead to the implication that\r\nthe only ground for an advance in wages was an increase in the cost of\r\nliving. The workmen have still to contend for a progressive improvement\r\nof their Standard of Life whatever happens to profits.\r\n\r\n[486] Executive Circular, October 12, 1874.\r\n\r\n[487] _Ibid._, October 21, 1879; as to the Sliding Scales actually\r\nadopted, see Appendix II.\r\n\r\n[488] _Miners’ Watchman and Labour Sentinel_, February 9, 1878--a\r\nquasi-official organ of the Northern Miners, which was published in\r\nLondon from January to May 1878.\r\n\r\n[489] “Should Wages be Regulated by Market Prices?” by Lloyd Jones,\r\n_Beehive_, July 18, 1874; see also his article in the issue for March\r\n14, 1874.\r\n\r\n[490] Lloyd Jones, one of the ablest and most loyal friends of Trade\r\nUnionism, was born at Bandon, in Ireland, in 1811, the son of a small\r\nworking master in the trade of fustian-cutting. Himself originally a\r\nworking fustian-cutter, Lloyd Jones became, like his father, a small\r\nmaster, but eventually abandoned that occupation for journalism.\r\nHe became an enthusiastic advocate of Co-operation, and in 1850 he\r\njoined Thomas Hughes and E. Vansittart Neale in a memorable lecturing\r\ntour through Lancashire. A few years later we find him in London, in\r\nclose touch with the Trade Union leaders, with whom he was on terms\r\nof intimate friendship. From the establishment of the _Beehive_ in\r\n1861 he was for eighteen years a frequent contributor, his articles\r\nbeing uniformly distinguished by literary ability, exact knowledge of\r\nindustrial facts, and shrewd foresight. From 1870 until his death in\r\n1886 he was frequently selected by the various Unions to present their\r\ncase in Arbitration proceedings. At the General Election of 1885 he\r\nstood as candidate for the Chester-le-Street Division of Durham, where\r\nhe was opposed by both the official Liberals and the Conservatives,\r\nand was unsuccessful. In conjunction with J. M. Ludlow, he wrote _The\r\nProgress of the Working Classes_, 1867, and afterwards published _The\r\nLife, Times, and Labours of Robert Owen_, to which a memoir by his son,\r\nMr. W. C. Jones, has since been prefixed.\r\n\r\n[491] _Beehive_, May 16, 1874.\r\n\r\n[492] This information we owe to personal friends and colleagues of\r\nMacdonald, Thomas Burt, M.P., and Ralph Young, who, as we have seen,\r\ndiffered from him on this point, and also on the allied question\r\nof regulation of output according to demand, to be preached by the\r\ncoal-miners as well as by the colliery companies, which Macdonald,\r\nthroughout his whole career, persistently advocated. See, for instance,\r\nhis speech at the local conference on the Depression of Trade, _Bristol\r\nMercury_, February 13, 1878.\r\n\r\n[493] A useful summary of these events is given in Dr. Kleinwächter’s\r\npamphlet, _Zur Geschichte der englischen Arbeiterbewegung in den Jahren\r\n1871 und 1874_ (Jena, 1878; 150 pp.).\r\n\r\n[494] _Beehive_, June 5, 1875.\r\n\r\n[495] The operatives’ case is well put in the Weavers’ Manifesto of\r\nJune 1878:\r\n\r\n“Fellow-workers--We are and have been engaged during the past nine\r\nweeks in the most memorable struggle between Capital and Labour in the\r\nhistory of the world. One hundred thousand factory workers are waging\r\nwar with their employers as to the best possible way to remove the\r\nglut from an overstocked cloth market, and at the same time reduce\r\nthe difficulties arising from an insufficient supply of raw cotton.\r\nTo remedy this state of things the employers propose a reduction of\r\nwages to the extent of ten per cent below the rate of wages agreed\r\nupon twenty-five years ago. On the other hand, we have contended that\r\na reduction in the rate of wages cannot either remove the glut in the\r\ncloth market or assist to tide us over the difficulty arising from the\r\nlimited supply of raw material. However, this has been the employers’\r\ntheory, and at various periods throughout the struggle we have made the\r\nfollowing propositions as a basis of settlement of this most calamitous\r\nstruggle:\r\n\r\n“1. A reduction of ten per cent, with four days’ working, or five per\r\ncent with five days’ working, until the glut in the cloth market and\r\nthe difficulties arising from the dearth of cotton had been removed.\r\n\r\n“2. To submit the whole question of short time or reduction, or both,\r\nto the arbitrement of any one or more impartial gentlemen.\r\n\r\n“3. To submit the entire question to two Manchester merchants or\r\nagents, two shippers conversant with the Manchester trade, and two\r\nbankers, one of each to be selected by the employers and the other\r\nby the operatives, with two employers and two operatives, with Lord\r\nDerby, the Bishop of Manchester, or any other impartial gentleman, as\r\nchairman, or, if necessary, referee.\r\n\r\n“4. To split the difference between us, and go to work unconditionally\r\nat a reduction of five per cent.\r\n\r\n“5. Through the Mayor of Burnley, to go to work three months at a\r\nreduction of five per cent, and if trade had not sufficiently improved\r\nat that time, to submit to a further reduction.\r\n\r\n“6.

Phillips Bevan\r\n(March 1880, _Stat. Soc. Journal_, vol. xliii. pp. 35-54). We have\r\nascertained that the strikes mentioned in the _Times_ between 1876 and\r\n1889 show the following variations:\r\n\r\n1876 17 1877 23 1878 38 1879 72 1880 46 1881 20 1882 14 1883 26 1884 31\r\n1885 20 1886 24 1887 27 1888 37 1889 111\r\n\r\n\r\n[498] Secret circular from the London Secretary (Sidney Smith) of the\r\nIron Trades Employers’ Association, December 1878; republished in\r\nCircular of Amalgamated Society of Engineers, January 3, 1879, and in\r\nReport of Executive Council for 1878-79, p. 31.\r\n\r\n[499] At Manchester, Bolton, Ramsbottom, Wrexham, Falmouth, Aldershot,\r\netc., the hours were thus lengthened.\r\n\r\n[500] To the ordinary reader it may be desirable to explain that the\r\nUnions have, in most trades, succeeded in establishing the principle\r\nof the payment of higher rates for overtime. But in most cases this is\r\nlimited to workers paid by time, no extra allowance being given to the\r\nman working by the piece.\r\n\r\nIt will be obvious that if a workman, ostensibly enjoying a Nine Hours\r\nDay, is habitually required to work overtime, and is paid only at the\r\nnormal piecework rate for his work, he obtains no advantage whatever\r\nfrom the nominal fixing of his hours of labour. To many thousands of\r\nmen in the engineering and building trades the nominal maintenance\r\nof the Nine Hours Day meant, in 1878 and succeeding years, no more\r\nthan this. See for the whole subject of “the Normal Day,” _Industrial\r\nDemocracy_, by S. and B. Webb.\r\n\r\n[501] The lowest point reached in the statistics of the annual Trades\r\nUnion Congresses was in 1881, when the delegates claimed to represent\r\nlittle more than a third of the numbers of 1874. These statistics of\r\nmembership are, however, in many respects misleading. The Congress\r\nof 1879 was attended by a much smaller number of delegates than any\r\nCongress since 1872, and the number of Unions represented was also the\r\nsmallest since that date.\r\n\r\n[502] “Four years ago,” writes the President of the Bristol Coopers’\r\nSociety in 1878, “upwards of 40,000 workmen were in combination in\r\nthese valleys [South Wales], and to-day not a single Union is in\r\nexistence throughout the entire district.” (Paper at Local Conference\r\non the Depression of Trade, _Bristol Mercury_, February 13, 1878).\r\n\r\n[503] See the injunctions of the General Secretary, Monthly Report,\r\nMarch 1862; Annual Reports, 1882 and 1888.

A large part of the work of the\r\nFederal Executive consisted, for many years, of adjusting disputes\r\nbetween Union and Union with regard to overlap and apportionment of\r\nwork.

To the historical student, on\r\nthe other hand, it has, during the last fifty years, been wanting\r\nin significance as an index to the real factors of the Trade Union\r\nMovement. Between 1871 and 1875, the period of the struggle for\r\ncomplete legalisation, the Congress concentrated the efforts of the\r\ndifferent sections upon the common object they had all at heart. On\r\nthe accomplishment of that object it became for ten years little more\r\nthan an annual gathering of Trade Union officials, in which they\r\ndelivered, with placid unanimity, their views on labour legislation and\r\nlabour politics.[511] From 1885 to 1890 we shall watch the Congress\r\nlosing its decorous calm, and gradually becoming the battle-field of\r\ncontending principles and rival leaders. But throughout its whole\r\ncareer it has, to speak strictly, been representative less of the\r\ndevelopment of Trade Unionism as such, than of the social and political\r\naspirations of its leading members.\r\n\r\nThe reader of the Congress proceedings between 1875 and 1885 would,\r\nfor instance, fail to recognise our description of the characteristics\r\nof the movement in these years. The predominant feature of the Trade\r\nUnion world between 1875 and 1885 was, as we have seen, an extreme\r\nand complicated sectionalism. It might therefore have been expected\r\nthat the annual meeting of delegates from different trades would\r\nhave been made the debating ground for all the moot points and vexed\r\nquestions of Trade Unionism, not to say the battle-field of opposing\r\ninterests. But though the Trades Union Congress, like all popular\r\nassemblies, had its stormy scenes and hot discussions, from 1875 to\r\n1885 these episodes arose only on personal questions, such as the\r\nconduct of individual members of the committee or the _bona fides_ of\r\nparticular delegates. On all questions of policy or principle before\r\nthe Congress the delegates were generally unanimous. This was brought\r\nabout by the deliberate exclusion of all Trade Union problems from the\r\nagenda. The relative merits of collective bargaining and legislative\r\nregulation were, during these years, never so much as discussed. The\r\nalternative types of benefit club and trade society were not compared.\r\nThe difficulties of overlap and apportionment of work were not even\r\nreferred to. No mention was made of Sliding Scales, Wage-Boards,\r\nPiecework Lists, or other expedients for avoiding disputes. Piecework\r\nitself, when introduced by a delegate in 1876, was dropped as a\r\ndangerous topic. The disputes between Union and Union were regarded by\r\nthe Committee as outside the proper scope of Congress.[512] In short,\r\nthe knotty problems of Trade Union organisation, the divergent views\r\nas to Trade Union policy, the effect on Trade Unionism of different\r\nmethods of remuneration--all the critical issues of industrial strife\r\nwere expressly excluded from the agenda of the Congress.\r\n\r\nFor the narrow limits thus set to the functions of the Congress there\r\nwas an historical reason. Arising as it did between 1868 and 1871, when\r\nthe one absorbing topic was the relation of Trade Unionism to the law,\r\nit had retained the character then impressed upon it of an exclusively\r\npolitical body. For many years its chief use was to give weight to the\r\nParliamentary action of the standing committee, whose influence in\r\nthe lobby of the House of Commons was directly proportionate to the\r\nnumbers they were believed to represent. Publicity and advertisement,\r\nthe first requisites of a successful Congress, were worse than useless\r\nwithout unanimity of opinion. The deliberate refusal of the Trade Union\r\nleaders to discuss internal problems in public Congress under such\r\ncircumstances was not surprising. Most men in their position would\r\nhave hesitated to let the world know that the apparent solidarity of\r\nTrade Unionism covered jealous disputes on technical questions, and\r\nfundamental differences as to policy. They easily persuaded themselves\r\nthat a yearly meeting of shifting delegates was fitted neither to\r\ndebate technical questions nor to serve as a tribunal of appeal. But\r\nthese difficulties could have been overcome. The quinquennial delegate\r\nmeeting of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers secures absolute\r\nfrankness of discussion by the exclusion of reporters; and the frequent\r\nnational conferences of miners achieve the same end by supplying\r\nthe press with their own abstract of the proceedings. The Miners’\r\nConference of 1863, which we have already described, had shown, too,\r\nhow successfully a large conference of workmen could resolve itself,\r\nfor special questions, into private committees, the reports being\r\nlaid before the whole conference at its public sittings--a device\r\nnot yet adopted by the Trades Union Congress. And the London Society\r\nof Compositors, which is governed practically by mass meetings, had,\r\nfor over half a century, known how to combine detailed investigation\r\nof complicated questions with Democratic decisions on principles\r\nof policy, by appointing special committees to report to the next\r\nsubsequent members’ meeting. The fact that no such expedients were\r\nsuggested shows that in these years the jealousy of most workmen of\r\noutside interference and their apathy about questions unconnected with\r\ntheir immediate trade interests, made their leaders unwilling to trust\r\nthem with real opportunities for full Democratic discussion.\r\n\r\nWe shall therefore not attempt to reconstruct the Trade Union\r\nMovement from the proceedings of its annual congresses. The following\r\nbrief analysis of their programmes and the achievements of the\r\nParliamentary Committee is meant to show, not the facts as to Trade\r\nUnion organisation throughout the country, with which we have already\r\ndealt, but the political and social ideals that filled the minds of\r\nthe more thoughtful and better educated working men, and the rapid\r\ntransformation of these ideals in the course of the last decade.[513]\r\n\r\nThe mantle of the Junta of 1867-71 had, by 1875, fallen upon a group\r\nof able organisers who, for many years, occupied the foremost place in\r\nthe Trade Union world. Between 1872 and 1875 Allan and Applegarth were\r\nreplaced by Henry Broadhurst, John Burnett, J. D. Prior, and George\r\nShipton.[514] These leaders had moulded their methods and policy upon\r\nthose of the able men who preceded them. It was they, indeed, aided by\r\nAlexander Macdonald and Thomas Burt, who had actually carried through\r\nthe final achievement of 1875. Like Allan, Applegarth, and Guile, they\r\nbelonged either to the iron or the building trades, and were permanent\r\nofficials of Trade Union organisations. A comparison of the private\r\nminutes of the Parliamentary Committee between 1875 and 1885 with those\r\nof the Conference of Amalgamated Trades of 1867-71 reveals how exactly\r\nthe new “Front Bench” carried on the traditions of the Junta. We see\r\nthe same shrewd caution and practical opportunism. We notice the same\r\nassiduous lobbying in the House of Commons, and the same recurring\r\ndeputations to evasive Ministers. For the first few years, at least,\r\nwe watch the Committee in frequent consultation with the same devoted\r\nlegal experts and Parliamentary friends.[515] Through the skilful\r\nguidance and indefatigable activity of Henry Broadhurst the political\r\nmachinery of the Trade Union Movement was maintained and even increased\r\nin efficiency. If during these years the occupants of the “Front\r\nBench” failed to give so decisive a lead to the Labour Movement as\r\ntheir predecessors had done, the fault lay, not in the men or in the\r\nmachinery, but rather in the programme which they set themselves to\r\ncarry out.\r\n\r\nThis programme, laid before all candidates for the House of Commons at\r\nthe General Election of 1874, was based, as John Prior subsequently\r\ndeclared, on the principle “that all exceptional legislation affecting\r\nworking men should be swept away, and that they should be placed on\r\nprecisely the same footing as other classes of the community.”[516]\r\nIts main items were the repeal of the hated Criminal Law Amendment Act\r\nof 1871, and the further legalisation of Trade Unionism. The sweeping\r\ntriumphs of 1875, and the acceptance by the Conservative Government of\r\nthe proposals of the Junta, denuded the programme for subsequent years\r\nof its most striking proposals. There remained over in this department\r\ncertain minor amendments of law and procedure which occupied the\r\nattention of the Committee for the next few years, and were gradually,\r\nby their exertions, carried into effect.[517]\r\n\r\nBut one great disability still lay upon working men as such. By the\r\ncommon law of England a person is liable for the results, not only\r\nof his own negligence, but also for that of his servant, if acting\r\nwithin the scope of his employment. The one exception is that, whereas\r\nto a stranger the master is liable for the negligence of any person\r\nwhom he employs, to his servant he is not liable for the negligence\r\nof a fellow-servant in common employment. By this legal refinement,\r\nwhich dates only from 1837, and which successive judicial decisions\r\nhave engrafted upon the common law, a workman who suffered injury\r\nthrough the negligence of some other person in the same employment\r\nwas precluded from recovering that compensation from the common\r\nemployer which a stranger, to whom the same accident had happened,\r\ncould claim and enforce.[518] If by the error of a signalman a railway\r\ntrain met with an accident, all the injured passengers could obtain\r\ncompensation from the railway company; but the engine-driver and guard\r\nwere expressly excluded from any remedy. What the workman demanded was\r\nthe abolition of the doctrine of “common employment,” and the placing\r\nof the employee upon exactly the same footing for compensation as any\r\nmember of the public.\r\n\r\nBy the influence of the Miners’ National Union and the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of the Railway Servants (established in 1872) the removal of\r\nthis disability was, from the first, placed in the foreground of the\r\nTrade Union programme. Year after year Employers’ Liability Bills\r\nwere brought in by the Trade Union representatives in the House of\r\nCommons, only to be met by stubborn resistance from the capitalists of\r\nboth parties. Through the pertinacity of Henry Broadhurst a partial\r\nreform[519] was obtained from Gladstone’s Government in 1880, in spite\r\nof the furious opposition of the great employers of labour sitting\r\non both sides of the House. The responsibility of the employer for\r\ninsuring his workmen against the risks of their calling was, for\r\nthe first time, clearly recognised by Parliament. The report of the\r\nParliamentary Committee for 1880 claimed that the main battle on the\r\nsubject had been fought, and that “time and opportunity only were now\r\nwanting for the completion of this work.” Since then the promotion\r\nof claims for compensation for accidents has been one of the most\r\nimportant functions of Trade Unions; and many of the societies, such as\r\nthe Bricklayers and Boilermakers, have recovered thousands of pounds\r\nfor injured members or their relatives.[520] But the doctrine of\r\n“common employment,” modified by this Act, was by no means abolished.\r\nEmployers, moreover, were allowed to induce their work-people to\r\n“contract out” of the provisions of the Act.[521] An Employers’\r\nLiability Bill, the last remnant of the demands of the Junta, remained,\r\ntherefore, from 1872 onward a permanent item in the Trade Union\r\nprogramme down to 1896.\r\n\r\nWith the exception of this one proposal the Parliamentary programme\r\nof the Trade Union world was framed, in effect, by the New Front\r\nBench. Curiously devoid of interest or reality, it is important to\r\nthe political student as showing to what extent the thoughtful and\r\nsuperior workman had, at this time, imbibed the characteristic ideas of\r\nmiddle-class reformers.\r\n\r\nThe programme of the Parliamentary Committee between 1875 and 1885\r\nfalls mainly under three heads. We have first a group of measures the\r\naim of which was the democratisation of the electoral, administrative,\r\nand judicial machinery of the State. Another set of reforms had for\r\ntheir end the enabling of the exceptionally thrifty or exceptionally\r\nindustrious man to rise out of the wage-earning class. A third group of\r\nproposals aimed at the legal regulation of the conditions of particular\r\nindustries.\r\n\r\nComplete political Democracy had been for over a century the creed\r\nof the superior workmen. It was therefore not unnatural that it\r\nshould come to the front in the Trades Union Congress. What appears\r\npeculiar is the form which this old-standing faith took in the hands\r\nof the Front Bench. The Trade Union leaders of 1837-42 had adopted\r\nenthusiastically the “Six Points” of the Charter. Even the sober\r\nJunta of 1867-71 had sat with Karl Marx on the committee of the\r\n“International,” in the programme of which Universal Suffrage was\r\nbut a preliminary bagatelle. To the Front Bench of 1875-85 Democracy\r\nappeared chiefly in the guise of the Codification of the Criminal\r\nLaw, the Reform of the Jury System, the creation of a Court of\r\nCriminal Appeal, and the Regulation of the Summary Jurisdiction of the\r\nMagistracy--a curious group of law reforms which it is easy to trace\r\nto the little knot of barristers who had stood by the Unions in their\r\nhour of trial.[522] We do not wish to deprecate the value of these\r\nproposals, framed in the interests of all classes of the community; but\r\nthey were not, and probably were never intended to be, in any sense a\r\ndemocratisation of our judicial system.[523] When the Congress dealt\r\nwith electoral reform it got no further than the assimilation of the\r\ncounty and borough franchise--already a commonplace of middle-class\r\nLiberalism. The student of Continental labour movements will find\r\nit difficult to believe that in the representative Congress of the\r\nEnglish artisans, amendments in favour of Manhood Suffrage were even\r\nas late as 1882 and 1883 rejected by large majorities.[524] Nor did\r\nthe Parliamentary Committee put even the County Franchise into their\r\nown programme until it had become the battle-cry of the Liberal party\r\nat the General Election of 1880. The Extension of the Hours of Polling\r\nbecomes a subject of discussion from 1878 onward, but the Payment of\r\nElection Expenses does not come up until 1883, and Payment of Members\r\nnot until 1884.\r\n\r\nScarcely less significant in character were the measures of social\r\nreform advocated during these years. The prominent Trade Unionists had\r\nbeen converted, as we have already had occasion to point out, to the\r\neconomic Individualism which at this time dominated the Liberal party.\r\nA significant proof of this unconscious conversion is to be found in\r\nthe unanimity with which a Trades Union Congress could repeatedly\r\npress for such “reforms” as Peasant Proprietorship, the purchase by\r\nthe artisan of his own cottage, the establishment of “self-governing\r\nworkshops,” the multiplication of patents in the hands of individual\r\nworkmen, and other changes which would cut at the root of Trade\r\nUnionism or any collective control of the means of production. For\r\nwhatever advantages there might be in turning the agricultural labourer\r\ninto a tiny freeholder, it is obvious that under such a system no\r\nAgricultural Labourers’ Union could exist. However useful it may be\r\nto make the town artisan independent of a landlord, it has been proved\r\nbeyond controversy that wage-earning owners of houses lose that perfect\r\nmobility which enables them, through their Trade Union, to boycott the\r\nbad employer or desert the low-paying district. And we can imagine the\r\ndismay with which the leaders of the Nine Hours Movement would have\r\ndiscovered that any considerable proportion of the engineering work of\r\nNewcastle was being done in workshops owned by artisans whose interests\r\nas capitalists or patentees conflicted with the common interests of all\r\nthe workers.\r\n\r\nIn no respect, however, does the conversion of the Trade Union leaders\r\nto middle-class views stand out more clearly than in their attitude\r\nto the clamour from the workers in certain industries for the legal\r\nprotection of their Standard of Life. From time immemorial one of\r\nthe leading tenets of Trade Unionism has been the desirability of\r\nmaintaining by law the minimum Standard of Life of the workers, and\r\nit was still steadfastly held by two important sections of the Trade\r\nUnion world, the Cotton Operatives and the Coal-miners. But to the\r\nParliamentary Committee of 1875-85, as to the Liberal legislators,\r\nevery demand for securing the conditions of labour by legislation\r\nappeared as an invidious exception, only to be justified by the special\r\nhelplessness or incompetency of the applicants. Nevertheless, many of\r\nthe trades succeeded in persuading Congress to back up the particular\r\nsectional legislation they desired. The Tailors asked, on the one hand,\r\nfor the extension of the Factory Acts to home workers, and, on the\r\nother, for compensation out of public funds when interfered with by the\r\nsanitary inspector. The Bakers complained with equal pertinacity of the\r\nlack of public inspection of bakehouses, and of the hardships of their\r\nregulation by the Smoke Prevention Acts. The London Cabmen sought the\r\naid of Congress, not against their employers, the cab proprietors, but\r\nagainst the public. The men in charge of engines and boilers demanded\r\nthat no one should be allowed to work at their trade without obtaining\r\nfrom the Government a certificate of competency. In the absence of any\r\nfixed or consistent idea of the collective interest of the wage-earning\r\nclass, or of Trade Unionists as such, every proposal that any section\r\ndemanded for itself was accepted with equanimity by the Congress,\r\nand passed on to the Parliamentary Committee to carry out, however\r\ninconsistent it might be with the general principles that swayed their\r\nminds.[525]\r\n\r\nIt is not difficult to understand why, with such a programme, the\r\nTrade Union world failed, between 1876 and 1885, to exercise any\r\neffective influence upon the House of Commons. A few concessions to\r\nthe wage-earners were, indeed, obtained from the Government. The\r\nEmployers’ Liability Act of 1880, to which we have already referred,\r\nrepresented, in spite of all its deficiencies, a new departure of\r\nconsiderable importance. Useful little clauses protecting the interests\r\nof the wage-earners were, through Broadhurst’s pertinacity, inserted\r\nin Chamberlain’s Bankruptcy Act and in his Joint Stock Companies\r\nAct.[526] But it was left to Charles Bradlaugh, who had never been a\r\nTrade Unionist, to initiate the useful law prohibiting the payment of\r\nwages in public-houses, though when it was introduced the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee (observing that it was unnecessary in respect of organised\r\ntrades) gave it a mild support. Bradlaugh it was, too, who in 1887 got\r\npassed the amendment of the law against Truck--a subject which the\r\nParliamentary Committee had, in 1877, dismissed from their programme\r\non the ground that they were unable, in the trades of which they had\r\nknowledge, to find sufficient evidence of its necessity.[527] But the\r\nfailure of the Parliamentary Committee to induce the Government of the\r\nday to legislate for wage-earners as such was naturally most patent\r\nin that group of reforms which dealt with the legal regulation of the\r\nconditions of labour. To the great consolidating Factory Bill of 1878\r\nthey found only four small amendments to propose; and of these only one\r\nwas carried.[528] The “Sweating System” of home work against which the\r\nTailors and Bootmakers were suggesting stringent but, as we venture to\r\nthink, ill-considered legislation was permitted to expand free from all\r\nregulation. The bakehouses, too, were allowed to slip virtually out of\r\ninspection. Deputation after deputation waited on the Home Secretary\r\nto press for an increase in the number of factory inspectors, only to\r\nbe met with the apparently unanswerable argument that it would cost\r\nmoney which the poor taxpayers could ill spare, until the astute and\r\npractical leaders of the Lancashire Cotton Operatives grew tired of the\r\nmonotonous regularity with which their resolutions in favour of further\r\nfactory inspection and more stringent regulations of the conditions of\r\ntheir trade were passed by Congress, and the little assistance which\r\nthis endorsement procured for them. A “Northern Counties Factory Act\r\nReform Association” was established in 1886, to do the work which the\r\nTrades Union Congress and its Parliamentary Committee had failed to\r\naccomplish. We have, in fact, only one important achievement of the\r\nParliamentary Committee to record in this department of social reform.\r\nFor years Congress had passed emphatic resolutions in favour of the\r\nselection of practical working men as Factory Inspectors. Great was\r\nthe jubilation at the appointment, in 1882, of J. D. Prior, General\r\nSecretary of the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters, and a member of the\r\nParliamentary Committee, to the post of Inspector.[529]\r\n\r\nIn matters of more general interest the Trade Union leaders were\r\nnot more successful, though the attempt to reform the law and its\r\nadministration resulted in some minor improvements. The first outcome\r\nof the projects for law reform so dear to the Congresses of 1876-80 was\r\nthe Justices’ Clerks Act of 1877, which enabled magistrates to remit\r\ncosts. The passing of the Summary Jurisdiction Act of 1879, which gave\r\ndefendants the right to claim trial before a jury whenever the penalty\r\nexceeded three months’ imprisonment, was, Howell observes, “materially\r\naided by the action of Congress.” But it is needless to inform the\r\nreader that the Criminal Law never got itself codified. To this day\r\njuries continue to be drawn exclusively from the upper and middle\r\nclasses. The long agitation for the abolition of the unpaid magistracy\r\nended in an anti-climax. The Liberal Government of 1884 left the system\r\nunaltered, but, on the nomination of Henry Broadhurst,[530] placed four\r\nTrade Union leaders upon the magisterial bench in certain Lancashire\r\nboroughs, a precedent since followed by successive Lord Chancellors.\r\n\r\nIn one direction the Parliamentary Committee saw their hopes fully\r\naccomplished. Their adoption of the particular projects of electoral\r\nreform advocated by the Liberal party enabled them to render effective\r\nhelp in the passing of the Acts of 1885, which assimilated the County\r\nand the Borough Franchise, effected a redistribution of seats, and made\r\nthe extended hours of polling universal. But the desire of successive\r\nCongresses for effective labour representation continued to be baulked\r\nby the extortion from candidates of heavy election expenses, and by\r\nthe refusal to provide payment for service in Parliament and other\r\npublic bodies. On the burning question of the land the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee supported with conscientious fervour Gladstone’s Irish\r\npolicy of creating small freeholds, and enthusiastically endorsed the\r\nproposals of Chamberlain for the extension of similar legislation to\r\nGreat Britain. The same spirit no doubt entered into their support of\r\nthe provisions of Chamberlain’s Patent Act, designed to facilitate the\r\ntaking out of patents by poor inventors. To sum up the situation, we\r\nmay say that the resolutions of the Trades Union Congress on questions\r\nof general politics between 1880 and 1884 were successfully pressed\r\non the Legislature only in so far as they happened to coincide with\r\nthe proposals of the Liberal party. With the one great exception of\r\nthe Employers’ Liability Act, nothing seems really to have called\r\nout the full energies of the leaders. The manifestoes and published\r\nmemoranda of the Parliamentary Committee during these years do not\r\ndiffer either in tone or in substance from the speeches and articles\r\nin which Chamberlain and other Radical capitalists were propounding\r\na programme of individualist Radicalism. In fact, the draft “Address\r\nto the Workmen of the United Kingdom,” which the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee, in anticipation of the General Election, submitted to\r\nthe Congress of 1885, fell far short of Chamberlain’s “Unauthorised\r\nProgramme.” It occurred neither to the Parliamentary Committee nor to\r\nthe Congress to suggest the obvious answer to Sir William Harcourt’s\r\nfinancial objection to increased factory inspection. No trace is to be\r\ndiscovered of any consciousness on the part of the Trade Union leaders\r\nof the existence of a very substantial tribute annually levied upon\r\nthe industrial world under the names of rent and interest. And even\r\nChamberlain’s modest and tentative proposals of these years, relating\r\nto the payment, by the recipients of that tribute, of some contribution\r\nby way of “ransom,” found no echo in the official programme of the\r\nTrade Union world. Finally, though the Congress had adopted Payment\r\nof Election Expenses in 1883, and Payment of Members in 1884, the\r\nParliamentary Committee omitted both these propositions from its\r\ndraft, and, like Gladstone, could not even bring itself to ask for\r\nFree Education. The three latter points were added to the draft by the\r\nCongress.\r\n\r\nThe assimilation of the political creed of the Trade Union leaders\r\nwith that of the official Liberal party was perfectly sincere. We have\r\nalready described, in the preceding chapter, how the Junta had begun\r\nto be unconsciously converted from the traditional position of Trade\r\nUnionism to the principle of Administrative Nihilism, then dominant\r\nin the middle class. It is unnecessary for us to argue whether this\r\nconception of the functions of law and government is or is not an\r\nadequate view of social development. The able and conscientious men\r\nwho formed the Front Bench of the Trades Union Congress of 1876-85 had\r\ngrown up without any alternative political theory, and had accordingly\r\nerected the objection to legislative interference or Governmental\r\nadministration into an absolute dogma.[531]\r\n\r\n_Laisser-faire_, then, was the political and social creed of the\r\nTrade Union leaders of this time. Up to 1885 they undoubtedly\r\nrepresented the views current among the rank and file. At that date\r\nall observers were agreed that the Trade Unions of Great Britain\r\nwould furnish an impenetrable barrier against Socialistic projects.\r\nWithin a decade we find the whole Trade Union world permeated with\r\nCollectivist ideas, and, as the _Times_ recorded as early as 1893,\r\nthe Socialist party supreme in the Trades Union Congress.[532] This\r\nrevolution in opinion is the chief event of Trade Union history at the\r\nclose of the nineteenth century; and we propose to analyse in some\r\ndetail the various influences which in our opinion co-operated to\r\nbring it about. We shall trace the beginnings of a new intellectual\r\nferment in the Trade Union world. We shall watch this working on\r\nminds awakened by an industrial contraction of exceptional character.\r\nWe shall see it resulting in the revelation of hideous details of\r\npoverty and degradation, for which deepening social compunction\r\nimperatively demanded a remedy. We shall describe the recrudescence of\r\na revolutionary Utopianism like the Owenism of 1833-34. We shall trace\r\nthe gradual schooling of the impracticable elements into a sobered and\r\nsomewhat bureaucratic Collectivism; and finally, we shall watch the\r\nrapid diffusion of this new faith throughout the whole Trade Union\r\nworld.[533]\r\n\r\nIf we had to assign to any one event the starting of the new current\r\nof thought, we should name the wide circulation in Great Britain\r\nof Henry George’s _Progress and Poverty_ during the years 1880-82.\r\nThe optimistic and aggressive tone of the book, in marked contrast with\r\nthe complacent quietism into which the English working-class movement\r\nhad sunk, and the force of the popularisation of the economic Theory\r\nof Rent, sounded the dominant note alike of the “New Unionism” and\r\nof the British Socialist Movement. Henry George made, it is true, no\r\ncontribution to the problems of industrial organisation; nor had he,\r\noutside of the “Single Tax” on land values, any intention of promoting\r\na general Collectivist movement. But he succeeded, where previous\r\nwriters had failed, in widely diffusing among all classes a vivid\r\nappreciation of the nature and results of the landlord’s appropriation\r\nof economic rent. It is, in our judgement, the spread among the town\r\nartisans of this conception of rent which has so largely transformed\r\nthe economic views of the Trade Union world, and which has gone far to\r\nshift the lines of politics. The land question in particular has been\r\ncompletely revolutionised. Instead of the Chartist cry of “Back to the\r\nLand,” still adhered to by rural labourers and belated politicians,\r\nthe town artisan is thinking of his claim to the unearned increment of\r\nurban land values, which he now watches falling into the coffers of the\r\ngreat landlords.\r\n\r\nBut if Henry George gave the starting push, it was the propaganda of\r\nthe Socialists that got the new movement under way. The Socialist\r\nparty, which became reorganised in London between 1881 and 1883, after\r\npractically a generation of quiescence, merged the project of Land\r\nNationalisation in the wider conception of an organised Democratic\r\ncommunity in which the collective power and the collective income\r\nshould be consciously directed to the common benefit of all.[534]\r\nWhilst Henry George was, almost in his own despite, driving Peasant\r\nProprietorship and Leasehold Enfranchisement out of the political\r\nfield, the impressive description which Karl Marx had given of the\r\neffects of the Industrial Revolution was interpreting to the thoughtful\r\nworkman the every-day incidents of industrial life. It needed no\r\nSocialist to convince the artisan in any of the great industries\r\nthat his chance of rising to be a successful employer was becoming\r\ndaily more remote. It required no agitator to point out that amid\r\nan enormous increase in wealth production the wages of the average\r\nmechanic remained scarcely sufficient to bring up his family in decency\r\nand comfort, whilst whole sections of his unskilled fellow-workers\r\nreceived less than the barest family maintenance. Even the skilled\r\nmechanic saw himself exposed to panics, commercial crises, and violent\r\nindustrial dislocations, over which neither he nor his Trade Union had\r\nany control, and by which he and his children were often reduced to\r\ndestitution. But it was the Socialists who supplied the workman with a\r\nplausible explanation of these untoward facts. Through the incessant\r\nlecturing of H. M. Hyndman, William Morris, and other disciples of\r\nKarl Marx, working men were taught that the impossibility of any large\r\nsection of the working class becoming their own employers was due, not\r\nto lack of self-control, capacity, or thrift, but to the Industrial\r\nRevolution, with its improvement of mechanical processes, its massing\r\nof capital, and the consequent extinction of the small _entrepreneur_\r\nby great industrial establishments. In this light the divorce of the\r\nmanual workers from the ownership of the means of production was\r\nseen to be no passing phase, but an economic development which must,\r\nunder any system of private control of industry, become steadily\r\nmore complete. And it was argued that the terrible alterations of\r\nover-production and commercial stagnation, the anomaly that a glut of\r\ncommodities should be a cause of destitution, were the direct result of\r\nthe management of industry with a view to personal profit, instead of\r\nto the satisfaction of public wants.\r\n\r\nThe economic circumstances of the time supplied the Socialist\r\nlecturers with dramatic illustrations of their theory. The acute\r\ndepression of 1878-79 had been succeeded by only a brief and partial\r\nexpansion during 1881-83. A period of prolonged though not exceptional\r\ncontraction followed, during which certain staple trades experienced\r\nthe most sudden and excessive fluctuations. In the great industry of\r\nshipbuilding, for instance, the bad times of 1879 were succeeded by a\r\nperiod during which trade expanded by leaps and bounds, more than twice\r\nthe tonnage being built in 1883 than in 1879. In the very next year\r\nthis enormous production came suddenly to an end, many shipbuilding\r\nyards being closed and whole towns on the north-east coast finding\r\ntheir occupation for the moment destroyed. The total tonnage built\r\nfell from 1,250,000 in 1883 to 750,000 in 1884, 540,000 in 1885, and\r\nto the still lower total of 473,000 in 1886. Thousands of the most\r\nhighly skilled and best organised mechanics, who had been brought to\r\nJarrow or Sunderland the year before, found themselves reduced to\r\nabsolute destitution, not from any failure of their industry, but\r\nmerely because the exigencies of competitive profit-making had led to\r\nthe concentration in one year of the normal production of two. “In\r\nevery shipbuilding port,” says Robert Knight in the Boilermakers’\r\nAnnual Report for 1886, “there are to be seen thousands of idle men\r\nvainly seeking for an honest day’s work. The privation that has been\r\nendured by them, their wives and children, is terrible to contemplate.\r\nSickness has been very prevalent, whilst the hundreds of pinched and\r\nhungry faces have told a tale of suffering and privation which no\r\noptimism could minimise or conceal. Hide it--cover it up as we may,\r\nthere is a depth of grief and trouble the full revelations of which, we\r\nbelieve, cannot be indefinitely postponed. The workman may be ignorant\r\nof science and the arts, and the sum of his exact knowledge may be\r\nonly that which he has gained in his closely circumscribed daily toil;\r\nbut he is not blind, and his thoughts do not take the shape of daily\r\nand hourly thanksgiving that his condition is not worse than it is;\r\nhe does not imitate the example of the pious shepherd of Salisbury\r\nPlain, who derived supreme contentment from the fact that a kind\r\nProvidence had vouchsafed him salt to eat with his potatoes. He sees\r\nthe lavish display of wealth in which he has no part. He sees a large\r\nand growing class enjoying inherited abundance. He sees miles of costly\r\nresidences, each occupied by fewer people than are crowded into single\r\nrooms of the tenement in which he lives. He cannot fail to reason that\r\nthere must be something wrong in a system which effects such unequal\r\ndistribution of the wealth created by labour.”\r\n\r\nOther skilled trades had, between 1883 and 1887, a similar though\r\nless dramatic experience. At the International Trades Union Congress\r\nof 1886, James Mawdsley, the cautious leader of the Lancashire\r\ncotton-spinners, speaking as a member of the Parliamentary Committee\r\non behalf of the British section, described the state of affairs\r\nin England in the following terms: “Wages had fallen, and there\r\nwas a great number of unemployed.... Flax mills were being closed\r\nevery day.... All the building trades were in a bad position; ...\r\nironfoundries were in difficulties, and one-third of the shipwrights\r\nwere without work.... Steam-engine makers were also slack, except those\r\nmanufacturers who exported to France, Germany, and Austria. With a few\r\nrare exceptions, the depression affecting the great leading trades was\r\nfelt in a thousand-and-one occupations. Seeing that there was a much\r\nlarger number of unemployed, the question naturally presented itself\r\nas to whether there was any chance of improvement. He considered there\r\nwas no chance of improvement so long as the present state of society\r\ncontinued to exist.... He did not understand their Socialism; he had\r\nnot studied it as perhaps he ought to have done. The workmen of England\r\nwere not so advanced as the workmen of the Continent. Nevertheless\r\nthey, at least, possessed one clear conception: they realised that\r\nthe actual producers did not obtain their share of the wealth they\r\ncreated.”[535] We see the same spirit spreading even to the most\r\nconservative and exclusive trades. “To our minds,” writes the Central\r\nSecretary of the powerful Union of Flint Glass Makers, “it is very\r\nhard for employers to attempt to force men into systems by which they\r\ncannot earn an honourable living. These unjust attempts to grind down\r\nthe working men will not be tolerated much longer, for revolutionary\r\nchanges are beginning to show themselves, and important matters\r\naffecting the industrial classes will speedily come to the front. Why,\r\nfor example, should Lord Dudley inherit coal-mines and land producing\r\n£1000 a day while his colliers have to slave all the week and cannot\r\nget a living?”[536]\r\n\r\nThe discontent was fanned by well-intentioned if somewhat sentimental\r\nphilanthropists, who were publishing their experiences in the sweated\r\nindustries and the slums of the great cities. The _Bitter Cry of\r\nOutcast London_ and other gruesome stories were revealing, not only\r\nto the middle class, but also to the “aristocracy of labour,” whole\r\nareas of industrial life which neither Trade Unionism nor Co-operation\r\ncould hope to reach. With the middle class the compunction thus excited\r\nresulted in elaborate investigations issuing in inconclusive reports.\r\nA Royal Commission on the Housing of the Poor produced nothing more\r\neffectual than a slight addition to the existing powers of vestries\r\nand Town Councils. Another on the Depression of Trade was absolutely\r\nbarren. A Select Committee of the House of Lords on the Poor Law failed\r\neven to discover the problems to be solved. Another on the Sweating\r\nSystem ended, after years of delay, in an accurate diagnosis of the\r\nevil, coupled with a confession of inability to cope with it. In 1885\r\nan Edinburgh philanthropist provided a thousand pounds for a public\r\nconference to inquire whether some more equitable system of industrial\r\nremuneration could not be suggested: a conference which served only\r\nto cast doubt on such philanthropic schemes as profit-sharing and\r\nthe “self-governing workshop,” whilst bringing into prominence the\r\nSocialist proposals.[537] And, more important than all these, Charles\r\nBooth, a great merchant and shipowner, began in 1886, at his own\r\nexpense, a systematic statistical inquiry into the actual social\r\ncondition of the whole population of London, the impressive results\r\nof which eventually reverberated from one end of the kingdom to the\r\nother.[538]\r\n\r\nThe outcome of the investigations thus set on foot was an incalculable\r\nimpetus to social reform. They had, for the most part, been undertaken\r\nin the expectation that a sober and scientific inquiry would prove\r\nthe exceptional character of the harrowing incidents laid bare by\r\nthe philanthropists, and unsparingly quoted by the new agitators.\r\nBut to the genuine surprise alike of the economists and the Trade\r\nUnion leaders, the lurid statements of the sensationalists and the\r\nSocialists were, on the whole, borne out by the statistics. The stories\r\nof unmerited misery were shown to be, not accidental exceptions to a\r\ngeneral condition of moderate well-being, but typical instances of the\r\naverage existence of great masses of the population. The “sweater”\r\nturned out to be, not an exceptionally cruel capitalist, but himself\r\nthe helpless product of a widespread degeneration which extended\r\nover whole industries. In the wealthiest and most productive city in\r\nthe world, Charles Booth, after an exhaustive census, was driven to\r\nthe conclusion that a million and a quarter persons fell habitually\r\nbelow his “Poverty Line.” Thirty-two per cent of the whole population\r\nof London (in some large districts over 60 per cent) were found to\r\nbe living in a state of chronic poverty, which precluded not only\r\nthe elementary conditions of civilisation and citizenship, but was\r\nincompatible with physical health or industrial efficiency. Moreover,\r\nCharles Booth’s figures and the report of the House of Lords Committee\r\non Sweating disproved, once for all, the comfortable assumption that\r\nall destitution originated in drink or vice. It was impossible, to use\r\nthe well-known phrase of Burke, to draw an indictment against a third\r\nof the people of London, or against two-thirds of the East End.\r\n\r\nThe daily experience of whole sections of the wage-earners during\r\nthese years of depression, and the statistical inquiries of the middle\r\nclass, appeared, therefore, to justify the Socialist indictment of\r\nthe capitalist system. What was perhaps of more effect was the fact\r\nthat the Socialists alone seemed inspired by faith in a radical\r\ntransformation of society, and that they alone offered a solution which\r\nhad not yet been tried and found wanting. Prior to 1867 it had been\r\npossible to ascribe the evil state of the wage-earners to the malignant\r\ninfluence of class government and political exclusion. Cobden and\r\nBright had eloquently described the millennium to be reached through\r\nuntaxed products. For a whole generation the leaders of a consolidated\r\nTrade Unionism had demonstrated the advantageous terms that the artisan\r\nmight, through collective bargaining and a reserve fund, wring from\r\nhis employers. But in face of a protracted lack of employment, the\r\nextended suffrage, Free Trade, and well-administered Trade Unions\r\nproved alike helpless. Twenty years of the franchise had left the town\r\nartisan still at the mercy of commercial gamblers and exposed to the\r\nextortions of the slum landlord. A Liberal Government was actually in\r\npower, wielding an enormous majority, but manifesting no keen desire to\r\nremedy the results of economic inequality. No attempt was being made to\r\nredress even the admitted wrongs of the necessitous taxpayer. The Tea\r\nDuty remained untouched; the Land Tax was left unreformed; whilst the\r\nlarger question of using some of the nation’s wealth to provide decent\r\nconditions of existence for the great bulk of the people was not even\r\nmooted. A further Extension of the Franchise, Free Trade, and Popular\r\nEducation were still the only social and economic panaceas that the\r\nLiberal party had to offer. But cheapness of commodities was of no use\r\nto the workman who was thrown out of employment; and the spread of\r\neducation served but to increase his discontent with existing social\r\nconditions and his ability to understand the theoretic explanations and\r\npractical proposals of the new school of reformers.\r\n\r\nThe working man found no more comfort in Trade Unionism than in party\r\npolitics. The mason, carpenter, or ironfounder saw, for instance,\r\nhis old and powerful Trade Society reduced to little more than a\r\nsick and burial club, refusing all support to strikes even against\r\nreductions of wages and increase of hours, and only maintaining\r\nits out-of-work benefit by running heavily into debt to its more\r\nprosperous members.[539] As the lean years followed one on another,\r\nhe saw the benefits reduced, the contributions raised, and numbers\r\nof staunch Unionists left high and dry as members “out of benefit.”\r\nThe trade friendly society--the “scientific Trade Unionism” of the\r\nFront Bench--was in fact becoming rapidly discredited. John Burns and\r\nTom Mann, young and energetic members of the Amalgamated Society of\r\nEngineers, were, between 1884 and 1889, vigorously denouncing, up and\r\ndown the country, the supineness of their great amalgamated Union. “How\r\nlong, how long,” appeals Tom Mann to the Trade Unionists in 1886,[540]\r\n“will you be content with the present half-hearted policy of your\r\nUnions? I readily grant that good work has been done in the past by\r\nthe Unions; but, in Heaven’s name, what good purpose are they serving\r\nnow? All of them have large numbers out of employment even when their\r\nparticular trade is busy. None of the important societies have any\r\npolicy other than that of endeavouring to keep wages from falling. The\r\ntrue Unionist policy of _aggression_ seems entirely lost sight of:\r\nin fact, the average Unionist of to-day is a man with a fossilised\r\nintellect, either hopelessly apathetic, or supporting a policy that\r\nplays directly into the hands of the capitalist exploiter.... I take my\r\nshare of the work of the Trade Union to which I belong; but I candidly\r\nconfess that unless it shows more vigour at the present time (June\r\n1886) I shall be compelled to take the view--against my will--that\r\nto continue to spend time over the ordinary squabble-investigating,\r\ndo-nothing policy will be an unjustifiable waste of one’s energies. I\r\nam sure there are thousands of others in my state of mind.”[541]\r\n\r\n“Constituted as it is,” writes John Burns in September 1887,[542]\r\n“Unionism carries within itself the source of its own dissolution....\r\nTheir reckless assumption of the duties and responsibilities that\r\nonly the State or whole community can discharge, in the nature of\r\nsick and superannuation benefits, at the instance of the middle\r\nclass, is crushing out the larger Unions by taxing their members to\r\nan unbearable extent. This so cripples them that the fear of being\r\nunable to discharge their friendly society liabilities often makes them\r\nsubmit to encroachments by the masters without protest. The result of\r\nthis is that all of them have ceased to be Unions for maintaining the\r\nrights of labour, and have degenerated into mere middle and upper class\r\nrate-reducing institutions.”[543]\r\n\r\nHere we see the beginning of that agitation against the combination of\r\nfriendly benefits with trade protection aims which subsequently became,\r\nfor a short time, one of the characteristics of the “New Unionism.” But\r\nif the trade friendly society withered up during these years into a\r\nmere benefit club, the purely trade society showed no greater vitality.\r\nThe great depression of 1878-79 had swept out of existence hundreds of\r\nlittle local Unions which lacked the cohesion given by the friendly\r\nsociety side. The Lancashire and Midland Miners’ organisations, which\r\ngave no benefits, had either collapsed altogether, or had dissolved\r\ninto isolated pit clubs, incapable of combined action. The Lancashire\r\ncotton operatives, the Northumberland and Durham miners, and a few\r\nother essentially trade societies, held together only by surrendering\r\nto the employers one concession after another. With capitalists ready\r\nat any moment to suspend a profitless business, collective bargaining\r\nproved as powerless to avert reductions as the individual contract.\r\nIn face of a long-continued depression of trade, marked by frequent\r\noscillations in particular industries, both types of Trade Unionism, it\r\nseemed, had been tried and found wanting.\r\n\r\nThese were the circumstances under which the disillusioned\r\nworking-class politician or Trade Unionist was reached by the\r\nlectures and writings of the Socialists, who offered him not only a\r\nsympathetic explanation of the ills from which he suffered, but also a\r\ncomprehensive scheme of social reform, extending from an Eight Hours\r\nBill to the Nationalisation of the Means of Production. In a purely\r\nhistorical essay it is unnecessary for us to discuss the validity of\r\nthe optimistic confidence with which the Socialists of these years\r\ndeclared that under a system of collective ownership the workers would\r\nnot only be ensured at all times a competent livelihood, but would\r\nthemselves control the administration of the surplus wealth of the\r\nnation. But in tracing the causes of the New Unionism of 1889-90, and\r\nthe transformation of the Trade Union Movement from an Individualist to\r\na Collectivist influence in the political world, we venture to ascribe\r\na large share to the superior attractiveness of this buoyant faith over\r\nanything offered by the almost cynical fatalism of the old school.\r\n\r\nThe Socialist agitation benefited between 1886 and 1889 by a series of\r\nundesigned advertisements. Meetings of “the unemployed” in February\r\n1886 led to unexpected riots, which threw all London into a panic,\r\nand were followed by a Government prosecution for sedition. Hyndman,\r\nBurns, Champion, and Williams, as the leaders of the Social Democratic\r\nFederation, were indicted at the Old Bailey, and their trial, ending\r\nin an acquittal, attracted the attention of the whole country to their\r\ndoctrines. The “Unemployed” gatherings went on with ever-increasing\r\nnoise until November 1887, when the Chief Commissioner of Police issued\r\na proclamation prohibiting meetings in Trafalgar Square, which had for\r\na whole generation served as the forum of the London agitator. This\r\n“attack on free speech” by a Conservative Government, coming after\r\nseveral minor attempts to suppress open-air meetings by its Liberal\r\npredecessor, rallied the forces of London artisan Radicalism to those\r\nof the Socialists. A gigantic demonstration on Sunday, November 13,\r\n1887, was held in defiance of the police, only to be repulsed from\r\nTrafalgar Square by a free use of the police bludgeon and the calling\r\nout of both cavalry and infantry. John Burns and Cunninghame Graham,\r\nM.P., were imprisoned for their share in this transaction. A similar\r\nagitation on a smaller scale was going on in the provinces. On Tyneside\r\nand in the Midlands numerous emissaries of the Social Democratic\r\nFederation and the Socialist League were spreading the revolt against\r\nthe helpless apathy into which the Trade Unions had sunk. In every\r\nlarge industrial centre the indefatigable lecturing of branches of\r\nSocialist organisations was stirring up a vague but effective unrest in\r\nall except the official circle of the Trade Union world.\r\n\r\nTo the great army of unskilled, or only partially skilled, workmen\r\nconcentrated in London and other large cities the new crusade came\r\nas a gospel of deliverance. The unskilled labourer was getting tired\r\nof being referred, as the sole means of bettering his condition, to\r\nthe “scientific Trade Unionism” alone recognised by the Front Bench.\r\nTrade Societies which admitted only workmen earning a high standard\r\nrate, which exacted a weekly contribution of not less than a shilling,\r\nand which frequently excluded all but regularly apprenticed men, were\r\nregarded by the builders’ labourer, the gas stoker, or the docker, as\r\naristocratic corporations with which he had as little in common as\r\nwith the House of Lords. “The great bulk of our labourers,” writes\r\nJohn Burns, “are ignored by the skilled workers. It is this selfish,\r\nsnobbish desertion by the higher grades of the lower that makes success\r\nin many disputes impossible. Ostracised by their fellows, a spirit\r\nof revenge alone often prompts men to oppose or remain indifferent\r\nto Unionism, when if the Unions were wiser and more conciliatory,\r\nsupport would have been forthcoming where now jealousy and discontent\r\nprevails.”[544] Even among the skilled workers, the younger artisans,\r\nif they had joined their Unions at all, were discontented with the\r\nexclusive and apathetic policy of the older members. Thus we find\r\nrising up, in such “aristocratic” Unions as the Amalgamated Society\r\nof Engineers and the London Society of Compositors, a “New Unionist”\r\nparty of young men, who vigorously objected to the degradation of a\r\nTrade Union into a mutual insurance company, who protested against\r\nthe exclusion of the lowly paid sections from the organisation of the\r\ntrade, and who advocated the use of the political influence of the\r\nSociety in the interests of Social-Democracy. By 1888 the Socialists\r\nhad not only secured the allegiance of large sections of the unskilled\r\nlabourers in London and some other towns, but had obtained an important\r\nbody of recruits in the great “Amalgamated” societies.\r\n\r\nAt this pass nothing short of strangulation could have kept the new\r\nspirit out of the Trade Union Congress. It is interesting to notice\r\nthat the first sign among the delegates is to be ascribed to the\r\ndirect influence of Karl Marx. At the 1878 Congress at Bristol we find\r\nAdam Weiler, an old member of the “International,” and a personal\r\nfriend of the great Socialist, reading a paper in which he advocated\r\nlegislation to limit the hours of labour.[545] At the next Congress\r\nWeiler took exception to the resolution in favour of establishing a\r\nPeasant Proprietorship moved on behalf of the Parliamentary Committee.\r\nBut in that year his amendment in favour of Land Nationalisation\r\ndid not even find a seconder. Three years later the effect of Henry\r\nGeorge’s propaganda becomes visible. In 1882, when the land question\r\nwas again raised, the two ideals were sharply contrasted, and in\r\nspite of protests against “communistic principles,” a rider declaring\r\nfor nationalisation was adopted by 71 votes to 31. The Parliamentary\r\nCommittee made no change in their attitude on the question, contending\r\nthat the vote had been taken in the absence of many delegates, and\r\nthat it did not represent the opinion of the Congress as a whole. This\r\ncontention was to some extent borne out by the votes of the next five\r\nCongresses, at all of which amendments in favour of the principle of\r\nnationalisation were rejected, though by decreasing majorities. At\r\nlength, in 1887, at the Swansea Congress, the tide turned, and a vague\r\naddendum in favour of Land Nationalisation was accepted.[546] At the\r\nBradford Congress in 1888 the very idea of Peasant Proprietorship had\r\ndisappeared. The representatives of the agricultural labourers now\r\nasked only for individual occupation of publicly owned allotments.\r\nUltimately the Congress adopted by 66 votes to 5 a distinct declaration\r\nin favour of Land Nationalisation, coupled with an instruction to the\r\nParliamentary Committee to bring the proposal before the House of\r\nCommons.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Weiler had made another and more successful attempt to\r\nenlist the aid of the Congress in the legal regulation of the hours of\r\nlabour. At the 1883 Congress he moved a resolution which instructed\r\nthe Parliamentary Committee to obtain the legal limitation to eight\r\nhours of the maximum day of all workers in the employment of public\r\nauthorities, or companies exercising Parliamentary powers. This was\r\nseconded by Edward Harford, the General Secretary of the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Railway Servants, and carried, in a thin meeting, by only\r\n33 to 8. In 1885 the movement had so far gained weight that the\r\nParliamentary Committee thought it expedient to temporise by promoting\r\nan investigation into the amount of overtime worked in Government\r\ndepartments, with the result of demonstrating how completely the\r\npractice of systematic overtime had neutralised the Nine Hours\r\nvictory.[547] At the 1887 Congress at Swansea the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee were instructed to take a vote of the Trade Union world\r\nupon the whole question, a vote which revealed the unexpected fact\r\nthat Applegarth’s own Union, the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters\r\nand Joiners, had been converted to an Eight Hours Bill.[548] A second\r\nplebiscite, taken at the instance of the following year’s Congress,\r\nshowed that such old Unions as the Compositors, the Ironfounders, and\r\nthe Railway Servants were swinging round.[549]\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the growing divergence of policy among the coal-miners,\r\nwhich we foreshadowed in the last chapter, had brought a powerful\r\ncontingent of organised workmen to the support of the new party.\r\nWe have already described the conversion of the leaders of the\r\nNorthumberland and Durham miners to the principle of the Sliding Scale,\r\ninvolving, as it did, the dependence of the worker’s standard of\r\ncomfort upon the market price of his product. On another point, too,\r\nthe two northern counties had broken away from the traditional policy\r\nof the Miners’ organisation. Already in 1863 we noted that Crawford,\r\none of the ablest of their leaders, was vigorously objecting, at the\r\nLeeds Conference, to an Eight Hours Bill for boys, on the ground that\r\nin Northumberland and Durham, where the hewers often worked in two\r\nshifts, such a restriction would interfere with the men’s convenience.\r\nThis resistance to a particular interference with the exceptional\r\ncircumstances of the local industry gradually developed into a general\r\nobjection to legal regulation of the hours of adult men. We find,\r\ntherefore, the Northumberland and Durham miners from 1875 onwards\r\nranging themselves more and more with the leaders of the iron and\r\nbuilding trades, who, as we have seen, had become largely converted to\r\nthe economic conceptions then current among the middle class. The fact\r\nthat the Northumberland and Durham Associations, almost alone among\r\nMiners’ Unions, had successfully weathered the bad times of 1877-79,\r\nand the constant presence of one or other of their leaders on the\r\nParliamentary Committee, caused these opinions to be accepted as those\r\nof the whole industry.\r\n\r\nBut the miners elsewhere did not long rest content with the new policy\r\nof Durham and Northumberland. In December 1881 the amalgamated South\r\nand West Yorkshire Miners’ Associations formally terminated the then\r\nexisting Sliding Scale, and passed a resolution in favour of the policy\r\nof restricting the output. During the following years the Yorkshire\r\nemployers several times proposed the re-establishment of a scale, but\r\nthe men insisted on its being accompanied by an agreement for a minimum\r\nbelow which wages should in no event fall--a condition to which the\r\ncoal-owners uniformly refused their assent. The lead given by the\r\nYorkshire miners was quickly followed by other districts, notably\r\nby Lancashire. In this county Trade Unionism among the miners had,\r\nas we have seen, gone to pieces in the bad years. Reorganisation in\r\nlocal Unions, came in 1881; and a Lancashire Miners’ Federation was\r\nsuccessfully established in the following year. At their Conference of\r\n1883 the delegates of the Lancashire miners resolved, “That the time\r\nhas come when the working miners shall regulate the production of coal;\r\nthat no collier or other underground worker shall work more than five\r\ndays or shifts per week; and that the hours from bank to bank be eight\r\nper shift.” Finding it impossible to secure their object by strikes,\r\nthe Lancashire men turned to that policy of legislative regulation\r\nwhich had marked the proceedings of the Conference of 1863.\r\n\r\nWith the improvement in trade which began in 1885, the membership\r\nand influence of the Lancashire and Yorkshire organisations\r\nrapidly increased, and new federations were started throughout the\r\nMidlands. The Scotch miners, too, had in 1886-87 a short outburst of\r\norganisation, when a national federation was formed with a membership\r\nof 23,000. All these Associations adopted the policy of regulating the\r\noutput, and the Scotch miners, in particular, conducted, in 1887, a\r\nvigorous agitation in support of the clause limiting the day’s work to\r\neight hours, which two Scottish members endeavoured to insert in the\r\nMines Regulation Act of 1887.[550] But the Executive of the National\r\nUnion had, since Macdonald’s death in 1881, fallen entirely into the\r\nhands of the Northumberland and Durham leaders. Under their influence\r\nit maintained its adherence to the principle of the Sliding Scale\r\nand its hostility to the Eight Hours Bill, thereby alienating, not\r\nonly the new federations, but also the old-established and powerful\r\nYorkshire Miners’ Association. From 1885 to 1888 the battle between the\r\ncontending doctrines ranged at every miners’ conference.[551] During\r\nthe latter year the combatants withdrew to separate camps. In September\r\n1888 a conference of the representatives of non-sliding scale districts\r\nwas called together in Manchester, when arrangements were made for the\r\nestablishment of a new federation, into which no district governed by\r\na sliding scale was to be allowed to enter. From this time forth the\r\nold National Union on the one hand, and the new Miners’ Federation on\r\nthe other, became rivals for the allegiance of the various district\r\nassociations, and somewhat unsympathetic critics of each other’s\r\npolicy and actions. The issue was not long doubtful. The National\r\nUnion gradually shrank up to Northumberland and Durham, whilst the\r\nMiners’ Federation, with its aggressive policy and its semi-Socialistic\r\nprinciples of a minimum wage and a legal day, grew apace. From 36,000\r\nmembers in 1888, it rose to 96,000 in 1889, 147,000 in 1891, and over\r\n200,000 in 1893, overshadowing in its growth all existing Trade Union\r\norganisations. The Socialist advocates of the legal limitation of the\r\nhours of labour accordingly enjoyed from 1888 onward, both in the Trade\r\nUnion Congress and at the polling-booths, the support of a rapidly\r\ngrowing contingent of organised miners, whose solid adhesion has done\r\nmore than anything else to promote the general movement in favour of an\r\nEight Hours Bill.\r\n\r\nIt is easy at this distance to recognise, in the altered tone of the\r\nrank and file of Congress delegates, a reflection of the wider change\r\nof opinion outside. But to the Trade Union Front Bench, as, in fact,\r\nto most of the politicians of the time, it was incredible that the new\r\nideas should gain any real footing among the skilled artisans. The\r\nParliamentary Committee regarded the innovations with much the same\r\nfeeling as that with which they had met the proposals of a little gang\r\nwhich had, in 1882, vainly attempted to foist the principles of fiscal\r\nprotection upon the Congress.[552] When Congress insisted on passing\r\na resolution with which the Parliamentary Committee found themselves\r\nin disagreement, this expression of opinion was sometimes ignored as\r\nbeing nothing more than the fad of particular delegates. It was in vain\r\nthat the Congress of 1888, after ten years’ deliberation, definitely\r\ndecided in favour of the principles of Land Nationalisation instead of\r\nPeasant Proprietorship. The Parliamentary Committee contented itself\r\nwith promising that “a well-considered measure” would be put forward\r\nby the Committee. The Eight Hours question could not be treated so\r\ncavalierly. Direct resolutions in favour of legislative action were\r\ntherefore staved off by proposals for inquiry. When a vote of the\r\nTrade Union world was decided upon, the Parliamentary Committee, in\r\nconjunction with many of the General Secretaries, were able practically\r\nto baulk the investigation. The voting paper was loaded with warnings\r\nand arguments against legislative action. No attempt was made to ensure\r\na genuine vote of the rank and file. In some cases the Executive\r\nCommittees were allowed to take upon themselves the responsibility of\r\ndeclaring the opinions held by the members of their societies, the\r\ntotal membership of which was then reckoned in the voting. In other\r\ninstances the Executives were permitted without remonstrance simply\r\nto burke the question. The inquiry failed to elicit any trustworthy\r\ncensus of the opinion of the Trade Union world.\r\n\r\nAn equal lack of sympathy was shown in connection with the growing\r\nfeeling of the Congress in favour of the participation of British\r\nTrade Unionists in International Congresses. At the express\r\ncommand of Congress, the Parliamentary Committee sent delegates to\r\nthe International gatherings of 1883 and 1886. But though these\r\ninstructions were complied with, the Parliamentary Committee made it\r\nclear, in their annual reports, that far from favouring International\r\naction, “the position they assumed was that they were so well\r\norganised, so far ahead of foreign workmen, that little could be\r\ndone until these were more on a level” with the skilled workers\r\nof England.[553] The Congress of 1886 nevertheless instructed the\r\nParliamentary Committee to summon an International Conference in London\r\nin the following year. Instead of complying with this instruction, the\r\nCommittee published, in May 1887, a lengthy pamphlet explaining that,\r\nowing to the indisposition of foreign workmen to make any pecuniary\r\nsacrifices for their Trade Unions, and the consequent lack of any\r\nstable working-class organisations, they had decided to refer the\r\nwhole question again to the forthcoming Trade Union Congress. When\r\nthe Congress met at Swansea in September 1887, it soon became evident\r\nthat the Parliamentary Committee, on this question as on others, was\r\nquite out of touch with its constituents. In spite of the influence of\r\nthe Front Bench, a resolution in favour of an International Congress\r\nwas adopted; and the Committee succeeded only in inducing Congress to\r\nimpose restrictions which were intended to exclude the delegates of the\r\nGerman Social-Democratic party. The International Congress was held in\r\nLondon in November 1888. Notwithstanding every precaution, a majority\r\nof the representatives proved to be of Socialist views, Mrs. Besant,\r\nJohn Burns, Tom Mann, and Keir Hardie appearing among the British\r\ndelegates. The stiff and unsympathetic attitude of the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee led to heated and, at times, unseemly controversies; and\r\nthe resolutions passed were treated by the Committee as of no account\r\nwhatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe net result of these proceedings was the loss by the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee of all intellectual leadership of the Trade Union world. They\r\nfailed either to resist the new ideas or to guide them into practicable\r\nchannels. The official Trade Union programme from 1885 to 1889 became\r\nsteadily more colourless, in striking contrast with the rapid march\r\nof politics in the country, which was sweeping the Liberal party\r\nforward year by year until in 1891 it adopted the so-called “Newcastle\r\nProgramme.” This programme formulated, though very inadequately, the\r\nnational side of that semi-collectivist policy which under the name of\r\nProgressivism had superseded Liberalism in the London County Council.\r\nAll that the Parliamentary Committee did was to abandon, one by one,\r\nthe proposals for the democratisation of the civil and judicial\r\nadministration which the Front Bench had so much at heart, without\r\nreplacing them by the more robust resolutions which the Congress\r\nin these years was passing. The Land Question, on which a vigorous\r\nadvocacy of the creation of small freeholders had been formerly\r\nmaintained, dwindled to a meaningless demand for undefined reform of\r\nthe land laws, and finally disappeared altogether on the adoption by\r\nthe Congress of the principle of nationalisation. The maintenance of\r\nthe Nine Hours Day, and the further reduction of the hours of labour by\r\nmeans of voluntary combination (a frequent item in the official agenda\r\nfrom 1875 to 1879) gradually dropped out altogether as the new demand\r\nfor legal regulation gathered strength. In short, the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee had perforce to give up those items in their programme which\r\nwere contrary to the new ideas of Congress, whilst they silently\r\nabstained from incorporating the new resolutions with which they were\r\npersonally not in agreement.\r\n\r\nIt would, however, be unfair to assume that the stock of official\r\nTrade Unionism was, during these years, absolutely barren of new\r\ndevelopments. To Mr. C. J. Drummond,[554] then Secretary to the\r\nLondon Society of Compositors, and a friend of the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee, belongs the credit of having taken the first step towards\r\nthe enforcement, through the Government, of a standard minimum wage. On\r\nthe revision of the Government printing contract in 1884, Mr. Drummond\r\nsecured the support of the Parliamentary Committee in an attempt to\r\ninduce the Stationery Office to adopt, as the basis for the contract,\r\nthe Trade Union rates of the London compositors. This attempt was,\r\nin the main, successful; but the new contract was nevertheless given\r\nto a “closed” house, in which no member of the Union could work.\r\nThe compositors did not let the matter rest. When the President of\r\nthe Local Government Board (Joseph Chamberlain) issued a circular\r\nin January 1886, as to the effects of the depression in trade, Mr.\r\nDrummond replied by explicitly demanding the Government’s recognition\r\nof the Standard Wage in all their dealings. The idea spread with\r\ngreat rapidity. A general demand was started that public authorities\r\nshould present a good example as employers of labour by themselves\r\npaying Trade Union rates, and insisting on their contractors doing the\r\nsame. Candidates for Parliament at the General Election of 1886 found\r\nthemselves, at the instance of the London Society of Compositors,[555]\r\nfor the first time “heckled” as to their willingness to insist on “Fair\r\nWages”; and it began slowly to dawn upon election agents that it might\r\nbe prejudicial for their election literature to bear the imprint of\r\n“rat houses.” In October 1886 the action of the London School Board in\r\ngiving its printing contract to an “unfair” house was bitterly resented\r\nby the London compositors, who induced the London Trades Council\r\nto go on a vain deputation of protest. When, in November 1888, the\r\nLondon School Board election came round, A. G. Cook, a member of the\r\nLondon Society of Compositors, secured election for Finsbury, avowedly\r\nas a champion of Trade Union wages; and two members of the Fabian\r\nSociety, Mrs. Annie Besant and the Rev. Stewart Headlam, won seats as\r\nSocialists. By their eloquence and tactical skill these members induced\r\nthe Board, early in 1889, to declare that it would henceforth insist\r\non the payment of “Fair Wages” by all its contractors, a policy in\r\nwhich the Board was promptly followed by the newly established London\r\nCounty Council.[556] This new departure by the leading public bodies in\r\nthe Metropolis did much to bring about a common understanding between\r\nthe official Trade Unionists and the new movement. It is needless to\r\ndescribe in this place how, since that date, the principle of “Fair\r\nWages” has developed. By 1894 a hundred and fifty local authorities\r\nhad adopted some kind of “Fair Wages” resolution. In 1890, and more\r\nexplicitly still in 1893, successive Governments found it necessary\r\nto repudiate the old principle of buying in the cheapest market,\r\nin favour of the now widespread feeling that public authorities as\r\nlarge employers of labour, instead of ignoring the condition of their\r\nemployees, should use their influence to maintain the Standard Rate of\r\nWages and Standard Hours of Labour recognised and in practice obtained\r\nby the Trade Unions concerned.\r\n\r\nThough the Front Bench as a whole maintained during these years its\r\npolicy of contemptuous inactivity, there were, as we have seen,\r\nsome signs of the permeation of the new ideas. It was under these\r\ncircumstances a grave misfortune that the inevitable criticism on\r\nthe Parliamentary Committee began by a scurrilous attack upon the\r\npersonal character and conduct of its leaders.[557] During the years\r\n1887-89 the conscientious adhesion to the Liberal party of most of\r\nthe Parliamentary Committee was made the occasion for gross charges\r\nof personal corruption. The General Secretaries of the great Unions,\r\nmen who had for a lifetime diligently served their constituents, found\r\ntheir influence undermined, their character attacked, and themselves\r\ndenounced, by the circulation all over the country of insidious\r\naccusations of treachery to the working classes. These charges found\r\na too ready acceptance among, and were repeated by, those young\r\nand impatient recruits of the new movement who knew nothing of the\r\nhistory and services of the men they were attacking. In the year 1889\r\nthe friction reached its climax. During the summer the attacks upon\r\nthe personal character of the Front Bench were redoubled. As the\r\ndate of the Trade Union Congress approached, it became known that a\r\ndetermined attempt would be made by the Socialist delegates to oust the\r\nParliamentary Committee from office. The Congress met at Dundee, and\r\nplunged straight into an angry conflict in which the Socialists were\r\ncompletely routed. The regular attenders of the Congress had, as we\r\nhave seen, been gradually absorbing many of the new ideas, and were not\r\naltogether satisfied with the way their resolutions had been ignored\r\nby the Parliamentary Committee. But all discontent or criticism was\r\nswept away by the anger which the character of the attack had excited.\r\nA great majority of the delegates came expressly pledged to support\r\nBroadhurst and his colleagues, and when the division was taken only 11\r\nout of a meeting of 188 delegates were found to vote against him. The\r\nCotton Operatives who had at all times supported factory legislation,\r\nthe Miners who were demanding an Eight Hours Bill, the Londoners\r\nwho came from the centre of the Socialist agitation--all rallied to\r\ndefend the Parliamentary Committee. The little knot of assailants\r\nwere thoroughly discredited; and the triumph of the “old gang” was\r\ncomplete.[558]\r\n\r\nThe victory of the Parliamentary Committee was hailed with satisfaction\r\nby all who were alarmed at the progress of the new ideas. For a moment\r\nit looked as if the organised Trade Unions of skilled workers had\r\ndefinitely separated themselves from the new labour movement growing\r\nup around them. Such a separation would, in our opinion, have been an\r\nalmost irreparable disaster. The Trade Union Congress could claim to\r\nrepresent less than 10 per cent of the wage-earners of the country.\r\nMany of the old societies were already shrinking up into insignificant\r\nminorities of superior workmen, intent mainly on securing their sick\r\nand superannuation benefits. Any definite exclusion of wider ideals\r\nmight easily have reduced the whole Trade Union organisation to nothing\r\nmore than a somewhat stagnant department of the Friendly Society\r\nmovement. This danger was averted by a series of dramatic events which\r\nbrought the new movement once more inside the Trade Union ranks. At the\r\nmoment that Henry Broadhurst was triumphing over his enemies at Dundee,\r\nthe London dock-labourers were marching to that brilliant victory over\r\ntheir employers which changed the whole face of the Trade Union world.\r\n\r\nThe great dock strike of 1889 was the culmination of an attempt to\r\norganise the unskilled workers which had begun in London two or three\r\nyears before. The privations suffered by the unemployed labourers\r\nduring the years of depression of trade, and the new spirit of\r\nhopefulness due to the Socialist propaganda, had led to efforts being\r\nmade to bring the vast hordes of unskilled workmen in the Metropolis\r\ninto some kind of organisation. At first this movement made very little\r\nprogress. In July 1888, however, the harsh treatment suffered by the\r\nwomen employed in making lucifer matches roused the burning indignation\r\nof Mrs. Besant, then editing _The Link_, a little weekly newspaper\r\nwhich had arisen out of the struggle for Trafalgar Square. A fiery\r\nleading article had the unexpected result of causing the match-girls\r\nto revolt; and 672 of them came out on strike. Without funds, without\r\norganisation, the struggle seemed hopeless. But by the indefatigable\r\nenergy of Mrs. Besant and Herbert Burrows public opinion was aroused\r\nin a manner never before witnessed; £400 was subscribed by hundreds\r\nof sympathisers in all classes; and after a fortnight’s obstinacy the\r\nemployers were compelled, by sheer pressure of public feeling, to make\r\nsome concessions to their workers.\r\n\r\nThe match-girls’ victory turned a new leaf in Trade Union annals.\r\nHitherto success had been in almost exact proportion to the workers’\r\nstrength. It was a new experience for the weak to succeed because of\r\ntheir very weakness, by means of the intervention of the public. The\r\nlesson was not lost on other classes of workers. The London gas-stokers\r\nwere being organised by Burns, Mann, and Tillett, aided by William\r\nThorne, himself a gas-worker and a man of sterling integrity and\r\ncapacity. The Gas-workers and General Labourers’ Union, established\r\nin May 1889, quickly enrolled many thousands of members, who in the\r\nfirst days of August simultaneously demanded a reduction of their\r\nhours of labour from twelve to eight per day. After an interval of\r\nacute suspense, during which the directors of the three great London\r\ngas companies measured their forces, peaceful counsels prevailed, and\r\nthe Eight Hours Day, to the general surprise of the men no less than\r\nthat of the public, was conceded without a struggle, and was even\r\naccompanied by a slight increase of the week’s wages.[559]\r\n\r\nThe success of such unorganised and unskilled workers as the\r\nMatch-makers and the Gas-stokers led to renewed efforts to bring the\r\ngreat army of Dock-labourers into the ranks of Trade Unionism. For two\r\nyears past the prominent London Socialists had journeyed to the dock\r\ngates in the early hours of the morning to preach organised revolt\r\nto the crowds of casuals struggling for work. Meanwhile Benjamin\r\nTillett, then working as a labourer in the tea warehouses, was\r\nspending his strength in the apparently hopeless task of constituting\r\nthe Tea-workers and General Labourers’ Union. The membership of this\r\nsociety fluctuated between 300 and 2500 members; it had practically\r\nno funds; and its very existence seemed precarious. Suddenly the\r\norganisation received a new impulse. An insignificant dispute on the\r\n12th of August 1889 as to the amount of “plus” (or bonus earned over\r\nand above the five-pence per hour) on a certain cargo, brought on an\r\nimpulsive strike of the labourers at the South-West India Dock. The men\r\ndemanded sixpence an hour, the abolition of sub-contract and piecework,\r\nextra pay for overtime, and a minimum engagement of four hours. Tillett\r\ncalled to his aid his friends Tom Mann and John Burns, and appealed\r\nto the whole body of dock labourers to take up the fight. The strike\r\nspread rapidly to all the docks north of the Thames. Within three\r\ndays ten thousand labourers had, with one accord, left the precarious\r\nand ill-paid work to get which they had, morning after morning,\r\nfought at the dock gates. The two powerful Unions of Stevedores (the\r\nbetter-paid, trained workmen who load ships for export) cast in their\r\nlot with the dockers, and in the course of the next week practically\r\nall the river-side labour had joined the strike. Under the magnetic\r\ninfluence of John Burns, who suddenly became famous as a labour leader\r\non both sides of the globe, the traffic of the world’s greatest port\r\nwas, for over four weeks, completely paralysed. An electric spark of\r\nsympathy with the poor dockers fired the enthusiasm of all classes of\r\nthe community. Public disapproval hindered the dock companies from\r\nobtaining, even for their unskilled labour, sufficient blacklegs to\r\ntake the strikers’ place. A public subscription of £48,736 allowed\r\nBurns to organise an elaborate system of strike-pay, which not only\r\nmaintained the honest docker, but also bribed every East End loafer\r\nto withhold his labour; and finally the concentrated pressure of\r\neditors, clergymen, shareholders, ship-owners, and merchants enabled\r\nCardinal Manning and Sydney (afterwards Lord) Buxton, as self-appointed\r\nmediators, to compel the Dock Directors to concede practically the\r\nwhole of the men’s demands, a delay of six weeks being granted to allow\r\nthe new arrangements to be made. As in the case of the match-girls\r\nin the previous year, the most remarkable feature of the dockers’\r\nstrike was the almost universal sympathy with the workers’ demands. A\r\npractical manifestation of that sympathy was given by the workmen of\r\nAustralia. The Australian newspapers published telegraphic accounts of\r\nthe conflict, with descriptions of the dockers’ wrongs, which produced\r\nan unparalleled and unexpected result. Public subscriptions in aid\r\nof the London dockers were opened in all the principal towns on the\r\nAustralian continent; and money poured in from all sides. Over £30,000\r\nwas remitted to London by telegraph--an absolutely unique contribution\r\ntowards the strike subsidy which went far to win the victory ultimately\r\nachieved.[560]\r\n\r\nThe immediate result of the dockers’ success was the formation of a\r\nlarge number of Trade Unions among the unskilled labourers. Branches\r\nof the Dock, Wharf, and Riverside Labourers’ Union (into which\r\nTillett’s little society was now transformed) were established at\r\nall the principal ports. A rival society of dockers, established at\r\nLiverpool, enrolled thousands of members at Glasgow and Belfast. The\r\nunskilled labourers in Newcastle joined the Tyneside and National\r\nLabour Union, which soon extended to all the neighbouring towns. The\r\nGas-workers’ Union enrolled tens of thousands of labourers of all\r\nkinds in the provincial cities. Organisation began again among the\r\nfarm labourers. The National Union of Agricultural Labourers, which\r\nhad sunk to a few thousand scattered members, suddenly rose in 1890\r\nto over 14,000. New societies arose, which took in general as well\r\nas farm labourers; such as the Eastern Counties Labour Federation,\r\nwhich, by 1892, had 17,000 members; and the smaller societies centring\r\nrespectively on Norwich, Devizes, Reading, Hitchin, Ipswich, and\r\nKingsland in Herefordshire.[561] The General Railway Workers’ Union,\r\noriginally established in 1889 as a rival to the Amalgamated Society\r\nof Railway Servants, took in great numbers of general labourers. The\r\nNational Amalgamated Sailors and Firemen’s Union,[562] established in\r\n1887, expanded during 1889 to a membership of 65,000. Within a year\r\nafter the dockers’ victory probably over 200,000 workers had been added\r\nto the Trade Union ranks, recruited from sections of the labour world\r\nformerly abandoned as incapable of organisation. All these societies\r\nwere marked by low contributions and comprehensive membership. They\r\nwere, at the outset, essentially, if not exclusively, devoted to\r\ntrade protection, and were largely political in their aims. Their\r\ncharacteristic spirit is aptly expressed by the resolution of the\r\nCongress of the General Railway Workers’ Union on the 19th of November\r\n1890: “That the Union shall remain a fighting one, and shall not be\r\nencumbered with any sick or accident fund.” “We have at present,”\r\nreports the General Secretary of the National Union of Gas-workers and\r\nGeneral Labourers in November 1889, “one of the strongest labour Unions\r\nin England. It is true we have only one benefit attached, and that is\r\nstrike pay. I do not believe in having sick pay, out-of-work pay, and a\r\nnumber of other pays.... The whole aim and intention of this Union is\r\nto reduce the hours of labour and reduce Sunday work.”[563]\r\n\r\nA wave of Trade Unionism, comparable in extent with those of 1833-34\r\nand 1873-74, was now spreading into every corner of British industry.\r\nAlready in 1888 the revival of trade has led to a marked increase in\r\nTrade Union membership. This normal growth now received a great impulse\r\nfrom the sensational events of the Dock strike. Even the oldest and\r\nmost aristocratic Unions were affected by the revivalist fervour of the\r\nnew leaders. The eleven principal societies in the shipbuilding and\r\nmetal trades, which had been, since 1885, on the decline, increased\r\nfrom 115,000 at the end of 1888 to 130,000 in 1889, 145,000 in 1890,\r\nand 155,000 in 1891. The ten largest Unions in the building trades,\r\nwhich between 1885 and 1888 had, in the aggregate, likewise declined\r\nin numbers, rose from 57,000 in 1888 to 63,000 in 1889, 80,000 in\r\n1890, and 94,000 in 1891. In certain individual societies the increase\r\nin membership during these years was unparalleled in their history.\r\nWe have already referred to the rapid rise between 1888 and 1891 of\r\nthat modern Colossus of Unions, the Miners’ Federation. The Operative\r\nSociety of Bricklayers, established in 1848, grew from a fairly\r\nstationary 7000 in 1888, to over 17,000 in 1891. The National Society\r\nof Boot and Shoe Operatives, established in 1874, went from 11,000 in\r\n1888 to 30,000 in 1891. And, to turn to quite a different industry,\r\nthe Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, a trade friendly society\r\nof the old type, established in 1872, rose from 12,000 in 1888 to\r\n30,000 in 1891. Nor was the expansion confined to a mere increase in\r\nmembership. New Trades Councils sprang up in all directions, whilst\r\nthose already existing were rejoined by the trades which had left\r\nthem. Federations of the Unions in kindred trades were set on foot,\r\nand competing societies in the same trade sank their rivalry in the\r\nformation of local joint committees.\r\n\r\nThe victory of the London Dockers and the impetus it gave to Trade\r\nUnionism throughout the country at last opened the eyes of the\r\nTrade Union world to the significance of the new movement. It was\r\nno longer possible for the Parliamentary Committee to denounce the\r\nSocialists as a set of outside intriguers, when Burns and Mann,\r\nnow become the representative working-men Socialists, stood at the\r\nhead of a body of 200,000 hitherto unorganised workmen. The general\r\nsecretaries of the older Unions, forming a compact official party\r\nbehind the Front Bench, were veering around towards the advanced\r\nparty. Their constituencies were becoming permeated with Socialism.\r\nIn many instances the older members now supported the new faith. In\r\nother cases they found themselves submerged by the large accessions\r\nto their membership which, as we have already seen, resulted from the\r\ngeneral expansion. The process of conversion was facilitated by the\r\ngenuine admiration felt by the whole Trade Union world for the great\r\norganising power and generalship shown by the leaders of the new\r\nmovement, and by the cessation of the personal abuse and recrimination\r\nwhich had hitherto marred the controversy. At the Dundee Congress of\r\n1889, as we have seen, Henry Broadhurst, and his colleagues on the\r\nParliamentary Committee, had triumphed all along the line. Within a\r\nyear the situation had entirely changed. The Stonemasons, Broadhurst’s\r\nown society, had decided, by a vote of the members, to support an Eight\r\nHours Bill, and Broadhurst, under these circumstances, had perforce\r\nto refuse to act as their representative. The Executive Council of\r\nthe Amalgamated Society of Engineers chose Burns and Mann as two out\r\nof their five delegates, impressing upon them all a recommendation\r\nto vote for the legal limitation of the hours of labour. Both the\r\nold-established societies of Carpenters gave a similar mandate. The\r\nMiners’ Federation this time led the attack on the old Front Bench,\r\nand the resolution in favour of a general Eight Hours Bill was\r\ncarried, after a heated debate, by 193 to 155. Broadhurst resigned his\r\nposition as Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee on the ground\r\nof ill-health. George Shipton, the secretary of the London Trades\r\nCouncil, publicly declared his conversion to the legal regulation of\r\nthe hours of labour. The Liverpool Congress was as decisive a victory\r\nfor the Socialists as that of Dundee had been for the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee. The delegates passed in all sixty resolutions. “Out of these\r\nsixty resolutions,” said John Burns, “forty-five were nothing more\r\nor less than direct appeals to the State and Municipalities of this\r\ncountry to do for the workman what Trade Unionism, ‘Old’ and ‘New,’\r\nhas proved itself incapable of doing. Forty-five out of the sixty\r\nresolutions were asking for State or Municipal interference on behalf\r\nof the weak against the strong. ‘Old’ Trade Unionists, from Lancashire,\r\nNorthumberland, and Birmingham, asked for as many of these resolutions\r\nas the delegates from London; but it is a remarkable and significant\r\nfact that 19 out of 20 delegates were in favour of the ‘New’ Trades\r\nUnion ideas of State interferences in all things except reduction of\r\nhours, and even on this we secured a majority that certainly entitles\r\nus Socialists to be jubilant at our success.”[564]\r\n\r\nBut whilst the new faith was being adopted by the rank and file of\r\nTrade Unionists the character of the Socialist propaganda had been\r\nundergoing an equal transformation. The foremost representative\r\nof the Collectivist views had hitherto been the Social-Democratic\r\nFederation, of which Burns and Mann were active members. Under the\r\ndominant influence of Mr. H. M. Hyndman, this association adopted the\r\neconomic basis and political organisation of State Socialism. Yet\r\nwe find, along with these modern views, a distinct recrudescence of\r\nthe characteristic projects of the revolutionary Owenism of 1833-34.\r\nThe student of the volumes of _Justice_ between 1884 and 1889 will\r\nbe struck by the unconscious resemblance of many of the ideas and\r\nmuch of the phraseology of its contributors, to those of the _Poor\r\nMan’s Guardian_ and the _Pioneer_ of 1834. We do not here allude to\r\nthe revival, in 1885, of the old demand for an Eight Hours Bill, a\r\nmeasure regarded on both occasions as a “mere palliative.” Nor need we\r\nrefer to the constant assumption, made alike by Robert Owen and the\r\nSocial-Democratic lecturers, that the acceptance of the Labour-value\r\ntheory would enable the difficulty of the “unemployed” to be solved\r\nby organising the mutual exchange of their unmarketable products.\r\nBut both in _Justice_ and the _Pioneer_ we see the same disbelief\r\nin separate action by particular Trade Unions, in contrast to an\r\norganisation including “every trade, skilled and unskilled, of every\r\nnationality under the sun.”[565] “The real emancipation of labour,”\r\nsays the official manifesto of the Social-Democratic Federation to\r\nthe Trade Unions of Great Britain in September 1884, “can only be\r\neffected by the solemn banding together of millions of human beings\r\nin a federation as wide as the civilised world.”[566] “The day has\r\ngone by,” we read in 1887, “for the efforts of isolated trades....\r\nNothing is to be gained for the workers as a class without the complete\r\norganisation of labourers of all grades, skilled and unskilled....\r\nWe appeal therefore earnestly to the skilled artisans of all trades,\r\nUnionists and non-Unionists alike, to make common cause with their\r\nunskilled brethren, and with us Social-Democrats, so that the workers\r\nmay themselves take hold of the means of production, and organise a\r\nCo-operative Commonwealth for themselves and their children.”[567]\r\nAnd if the “scientific Socialists” of 1885 were logically pledged to\r\nthe administration of industry by the officials of the community at\r\nlarge, none the less do we see constantly cropping up, especially among\r\nthe working-class members, Owen’s diametrically opposite proposal\r\nthat the workers must “own their own factories and decide by vote\r\nwho their managers and foremen shall be.”[568] Above all we see the\r\nsame faith in the near and inevitable advent of a sudden revolution,\r\nwhen “it will only need a compact minority to take advantage of some\r\nopportune accident that will surely come, to overthrow the present\r\nsystem, and once and for all lift the toilers from the present social\r\ndegradation.”[569] “Noble Robert Owen,” says Mr. Hyndman in 1885,\r\n“seventy years ago perceived ‘the utter impossibility of succeeding\r\nin permanently improving the condition of our population by any\r\nhalf-measures.’ We see the same truth if possible yet more clearly\r\nnow. But the revolution which in his day was unprepared is now ripe\r\nand ready.... Nothing short of a revolution which shall place the\r\nproducers of wealth in control of their own country can possibly change\r\nmatters for the better.... Will it be peaceful? We hope it may. That\r\ndoes not depend upon us. But, peaceful or violent, the great social\r\nrevolution of the nineteenth century is at hand, and if fighting should\r\nbe necessary the workers may at least remember the profound historical\r\ntruth that ‘Force is the midwife of progress delivering the old society\r\npregnant with the new,’ and reflect that they are striving for the\r\nfinal overthrow of a tyranny more degrading than the worst chattel\r\nslavery of ancient times.”[570] “Let our mission be,” he writes in\r\n1887, “to help to band together the workers of the world for the great\r\nclass struggle against their exploiters. No better date could be chosen\r\nfor the establishment of such international action on a sound basis\r\nthan the year 1889, which the classes look forward to with trembling\r\nand the masses with hope. I advocate no hasty outbreak, no premature\r\nand violent attempt on the part of the people to realise the full\r\nSocial-Democratic programme. But I do say that from this time onwards\r\nwe, as the Social-Democratic Labour Party of Great Britain, should make\r\nevery effort to bear our part in the celebration by the international\r\nproletariat of the First Centenary of the great French Revolution, and\r\nthus to prepare for a complete International Social Revolution before\r\nthe end of the century.”[571]\r\n\r\nThe year 1889, instead of ushering in a “complete International Social\r\nRevolution” by a universal compact of the workers, turned the current\r\nof Socialist propaganda from revolutionary to constitutional channels.\r\nThe advent of political Democracy had put out of date the project\r\nof “a combined assault by workers of every trade and grade against\r\nthe murderous monopoly of the minority.”[572] For a moment, at the\r\nvery crisis of the dockers’ struggle, the idea of a “General Strike”\r\nflickers up, only to be quickly abandoned as impracticable. When the\r\nproblems of administration had actually to be faced by the new leaders\r\nthe specially Owenite characteristics of the Socialist propaganda\r\nwere quietly dropped. In January 1889 John Burns was elected a member\r\nof the London County Council, and quickly found himself organising\r\nthe beginnings of a bureaucratic municipal Collectivism, as far\r\nremoved from Owen’s “national companies” as from the conceptions of\r\nthe Manchester School. Tom Mann, as president of the Dockers’ Union,\r\ncould not help discovering how impracticable it was to set to work\r\nhis unemployed members, accustomed only to general labour, in the\r\nproduction for mutual exchange of the bread and clothing of which\r\nthey were in need. And whether working in municipal committees, or at\r\nthe head office of a great Union, both Burns and Mann had perforce to\r\nrealise the impossibility of bringing about any sudden or simultaneous\r\nchange in the social or industrial organisation of the whole community,\r\nor even of one town or trade.\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is perhaps not surprising that Burns\r\nand Mann left the Social Democratic Federation, and found themselves\r\nhotly denounced by their old comrades.[573] With the defection of the\r\nNew Unionists, revolutionary Socialism ceased to grow; and the rival\r\npropaganda of constitutional action became the characteristic feature\r\nof the British Socialist Movement. Far from abusing or deprecating\r\nTrade Unionism or Co-operation, the constitutional Collectivists urged\r\nit as a primary duty upon every working-class Socialist to become\r\na member of his Trade Union, to belong to the local Co-operative\r\nSociety, and generally to take as active a part as possible in all\r\norganisations. Instead of denouncing partial reforms as mischievous\r\nattempts to defeat “the Social Revolution,” the New Unionist leaders\r\nappealed to their followers to put their own representatives on Town\r\nCouncils, and generally to use their electoral influence to bring\r\nabout, in a regular and constitutional manner, the particular changes\r\nthey had at heart. Instead of circulating calumnies against the\r\npersonal character of Trade Union leaders, they flooded the Trade Union\r\nworld with Socialist literature, dealing not so much in rhetorical\r\nappeals or Utopian aspirations as in economic expositions of the actual\r\ngrievances of industrial life. The vague resolutions of the Trades\r\nUnion Congresses were worked out in practical detail, or even embodied\r\nin draft bills which the local member of Parliament might be invited to\r\nintroduce, or driven to support.\r\n\r\nThe new policy, adopted as it was by such prominent Socialists as\r\nBurns, Mann, and Tillett, and Mrs. Besant, appeared, from 1889 onward,\r\nincreasingly justified by its success. The Collectivist victories\r\non the London School Board and County Council, the steady growth\r\nof municipal activity, and the increasing influence exercised by\r\nworking-men members of representative bodies, went far to persuade\r\nboth Socialists and Trade Unionists that the only practicable means\r\nof securing for the community the ownership and control of the means\r\nof production lay in a wide extension of that national and municipal\r\norganisation of public services towards which Parliament and the Town\r\nCouncils had already taken the first steps. In those industries in\r\nwhich neither national nor municipal administration was yet possible,\r\nthe Socialists demanded such a regulation of the conditions of\r\nemployment as would ensure to every worker a minimum Standard of Life.\r\nThe extension of the Factory Acts and the more thorough administration\r\nof the Sanitary Law accordingly received a new impulse. In another\r\ndirection the drastic taxation of Rent and Interest, pressed for by\r\nLand Nationalisers and Socialists alike, was justified as leading\r\neventually to the collective absorption of all unearned incomes. In\r\nshort, from 1889 onward, the chief efforts of the British Socialist\r\nMovement have been directed, not to bringing about any sudden,\r\ncomplete, or simultaneous revolution, but to impregnating all the\r\nexisting forces of society with Collectivist ideals and Collectivist\r\nprinciples.[574]\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the “New Unionism” of 1889-90 we close this chapter.\r\nWe shall see, in subsequent chapters to what extent, and in what way,\r\nthe Trade Union Movement was permanently affected by the new movement.\r\nBut we append at this point a brief account of what seem to us, first,\r\nthe ephemeral features and, secondly, the more durable results of an\r\nimpulse which did not wholly spend its force for a whole decade.\r\n\r\nIf we were to believe some of the more enthusiastic apostles of the\r\n“New Unionism,” we should imagine that the aggressive trade society\r\nof unskilled labourers, unencumbered with friendly benefits, was\r\nan unprecedented departure in the history of labour organisation.\r\nThose who have followed our history thus far will know better than\r\nto entertain such an illusion, itself an old characteristic of Trade\r\nUnionist revivals. The purely trade society is as old as Trade Unionism\r\nitself. Throughout the whole history of the movement we find two\r\ntypes of societies co-existing. At special crises in the annals of\r\nTrade Unionism we see one or other of these types taking the lead,\r\nand becoming the “New Unionism” of that particular period. Both trade\r\nsociety and friendly society with trade objects were common in the\r\neighteenth century. Legal persecution of trade combination brought to\r\nthe front the Union cloaked in the guise of a benefit club; and it\r\nwas mainly for organisations of this type that Place and Hume won the\r\nemancipation of 1824-1825. In 1833-34 we find Place deploring as a\r\nmischievous innovation the growth of the new “Trades Unions” without\r\nfriendly benefits. Twenty years later we see the leadership reverting\r\nto the “new model” of an elaborate trade friendly society which, for\r\na whole generation, was vehemently denounced by employers as a fraud\r\non the provident workman. The “New Unionism” of 1852, described by so\r\nfriendly a critic as Professor Beesly as a novel departure, became,\r\nin its turn, the “Old Unionism” of 1889, when the more progressive\r\nspirits again plumed themselves on eliminating from their brand-new\r\norganisations the enervating influences of friendly benefits.\r\n\r\nA closer examination of the facts shows that this almost rhythmical\r\nalternation of type has been only apparent. The impartial student will\r\nnotice that whilst the purely trade society has been persistently\r\nadhered to by certain important industries, such as the Coal-miners\r\nand the Cotton-spinners, other trades, like the Engineers and the\r\nIronfounders, have remained equally constant to the trade friendly\r\nsociety; whilst others, again, such as the Compositors and the\r\nCarpenters, have passed backwards and forwards from one model to the\r\nother. But besides this adaptation of type to the circumstances of\r\nparticular industries, we see also a preference for the purely trade\r\nsociety on no higher ground than its cheapness. The high contributions\r\nand levies paid by the Cotton-spinners to their essentially trade\r\nsociety are as far beyond the means of the Agricultural Labourer or\r\nthe Docker as the weekly premiums for superannuation, sick, and other\r\nbenefits charged to the Amalgamated Engineer. When, as in 1833-34,\r\n1872, and 1889, a wave of enthusiasm sweeps the unskilled labourers\r\ninto the Trade Union ranks, it is obviously necessary to form, at\r\nany rate in the first instance, organisations which make no greater\r\ntax upon their miserable earnings than a penny or twopence per\r\nweek. The apparent rhythm of alternations between the two types of\r\norganisation is due, therefore, not to any general abandonment of one\r\nfor the other, but to the accidental prominence, in certain crises of\r\nTrade Union history, of the Unions belonging to particular trades or\r\nclasses of wage-earners. When, for instance, the cotton-spinners, the\r\nbuilders, and the unskilled labourers of 1834 loomed large to Francis\r\nPlace as a revolutionary force, the purely trade society appeared to\r\nhim to be the source of all that was evil in Trade Unionism. When,\r\nin 1848-52, the iron trades were conspiring against piecework and\r\novertime, it was especially the illicit combination of trade and\r\nfriendly society which attracted the attention of the public, and\r\ncalled forth the denunciations of the capitalist class. And when in\r\n1889 the dockers were stopping the trade of London, and the coal-miners\r\nand cotton-spinners were pressing upon both political parties their\r\ndemands for legislative interference, we see George Howell voicing\r\nthe opposition to exclusively trade societies as dangerously militant\r\nbodies.[575]\r\n\r\nIf the purely trade society is no new thing, still less is the\r\nextension of Trade Unionism to the unskilled labourer an unprecedented\r\ninnovation. The enthusiasm which, in 1872, enrolled a hundred thousand\r\nagricultural labourers in a few months, produced also numerous small\r\nsocieties of town labourers, some of which survived for years before\r\nabsorption into larger organisations. The London and Counties Labour\r\nLeague, established as the Kent and Sussex Agricultural and General\r\nLabourers’ Union in 1872, has maintained its existence down to the\r\npresent day. The expansion of 1852 led to the formation in Glasgow of\r\na Labourers’ Society, which is reputed to have enrolled thousands of\r\nmembers. But it is with the enthusiasm of 1833-34 that the movement\r\nof 1889-90 has in this respect the greatest analogy. The almost\r\ninstantaneous conversion to Trade Unionism after the dock strike of\r\ntens of thousands of the unskilled labourers of the towns recalls,\r\nindeed, nothing so much as the rapid enrolment of recruits among\r\nthe poorest wage-earners by the emissaries of the Grand National\r\nConsolidated Trades Union.\r\n\r\nBut however strongly the outward features of the wave of 1889-90 may\r\nremind the student of those of 1833-34, the characteristics peculiar\r\nto the new movement significantly measure the extent of the advance,\r\nboth in social theory and social methods, made by the wage-earners in\r\nthe two intervening generations. Time and experience alone will show\r\nhow far the empirical Socialism of the Trade Unionist of 1889, with\r\nits eclectic opportunism, its preference for municipal collectivism,\r\nits cautious adaptation of existing social structure, and its modest\r\naspirations to a gradually increasing participation of the workmen in\r\ncontrol, may safely be pronounced superior in practicability to the\r\nrevolutionary and universal Communism of Robert Owen. In truth, the\r\nradical distinction between 1833-34 and 1889-90 is not a matter of\r\nthe particular social theories which inspired the outbursts. To the\r\ngreat majority of the Trade Unionists the theories of the leaders at\r\neither date did but embody a vague aspiration after a more equitable\r\nsocial order. The practical difference--the difference reflected in\r\nthe character and temper of the men attracted to the two movements,\r\nand of the attitude of the public towards them--is the difference of\r\nmethod and immediate action. Robert Owen, as we have seen, despised\r\nand rejected political action, and strove to form a new voluntary\r\norganisation which should supersede, almost instantaneously and in\r\nsome unexplained way, the whole industrial, political, and social\r\nadministration of the country. In this disdain of all existing\r\norganisations, and the suddenness of the complete “social revolution”\r\nwhich it contemplated, the Owenism of 1833-34 found, as we have seen,\r\nan echo in much of the Socialist propaganda of 1884-89. The leaders\r\nof the New Unionists, on the contrary, sought to bring into the\r\nranks of existing organisations--the Trade Union, the Municipality,\r\nor the State--great masses of unorganised workers who had hitherto\r\nbeen either absolutely outside the pale, or inert elements within it.\r\nThey aimed, not at superseding existing social structures, but at\r\ncapturing them all in the interests of the wage-earners. Above all,\r\nthey sought to teach the great masses of undisciplined workers how\r\nto apply their newly acquired political power so as to obtain, in a\r\nperfectly constitutional manner, whatever changes in legislation or\r\nadministration they desired.\r\n\r\nThe difference in method between the “New Unionism” of 1833-34\r\nand that of 1889-90 may, we think, be ascribed in the main to the\r\ndifference between the circumstances under which the movements arose.\r\nTo Robert Owen, whose path was blocked on the political line by the\r\ndisfranchisement of five out of six of the adult male population,\r\nopen voting under intimidation, corrupt close corporations in the\r\ntowns and a Whig oligarchy at the centre, the idea of relying on the\r\nconstitutional instrument of the polling-booth must have appeared\r\nno less chimerical than his own programme appears to-day. The New\r\nUnionists of 1889-90, on the other hand, found ready for their use\r\nan extensive and all-embracing Democratic social structure, which it\r\nwas impossible to destroy, and would have been foolish to attempt\r\nto ignore. The efforts of two generations of Radical Individualists\r\nand “Old Trade Unionists” had placed the legislative power and civil\r\nadministration of the country in the hands of a hierarchy of popularly\r\nelected representative bodies. The great engine of taxation was, for\r\ninstance, now under the control of the wage-earning voters instead\r\nof that of the land-owning class. The Home Secretary and the factory\r\ninspector, the relieving-officer and the borough surveyor, could be\r\nemployed to carry out the behests of the workers instead of those of\r\nthe capitalists. And thus it came about that the methods advocated\r\nby the New Unionists of 1889-94 resemble, not those of the Owenites\r\nof 1833-34, but much more the practical arts of political warfare so\r\nsuccessfully pursued by the Junta of 1867-75.\r\n\r\nWe shall see the change which had come over the English working-class\r\nmovement in the course of sixty years if we compare the leaders of the\r\ntwo movements which we have been contrasting. To Owen himself we may\r\nallow the privilege of his genius, which did not prevent him from being\r\nan extravagantly bad captain for a working-class movement. But in his\r\nleading disciples ignorance of industrial conditions, contemptuous\r\nindifference to facts and figures, and incapacity to measure, even in\r\nthe smallest actions, the relation between the means and the end, stand\r\nin as marked contrast to the sober judgment of men like John Burns as\r\nthey did to the cautious shrewdness of Allan and Applegarth. It would\r\nindeed be easy to find many traits of personal likeness between Burns\r\nand Mann on the one hand, and Allan and Applegarth on the other. High\r\npersonal character, scrupulous integrity, dignity or charm of manner,\r\nmarked all four alike, and the resemblance of character is heightened\r\nby a noticeable resemblance in the nature of their activity. The day’s\r\nwork of Tom Mann at the head office of the Dockers’ Union from 1889 to\r\n1892, and that of John Burns in the London County Council and the lobby\r\nof the House of Commons from 1892 to 1906, were close reproductions\r\nof Allan’s activity at the general office of his Engineers, and\r\nApplegarth’s assiduous attendance to Parliamentary Committees and\r\nRoyal Commissions. In short, the ways and means of the leaders of\r\nthe “New Unionism” remind the student, not of the mystic rites and\r\nskeleton mummery of the Owenite movement, but rather of the restless\r\nenergy and political ingenuity of the Junta or the Trades Union\r\nCongress Parliamentary Committee in those early days when the old Trade\r\nUnionists were fighting for legislative reforms with a faith which was\r\nas wise as it was fervent and sincere.\r\n\r\nSome of the secondary characteristics of the New Unionism of 1889\r\npromptly faded away. The revulsion of feeling against the combination\r\nof friendly benefits with Trade Union purposes quickly disappeared,\r\nthough the difficulty of levying high contributions upon ill-paid\r\nworkers prevented the complete adoption of the contrary policy.[576]\r\nThe expansion of trade which began in 1889 proved to be but of brief\r\nduration, and with the returning contraction of 1892 many of the\r\nadvantages gained by the wage-earners were lost. Under the influence\r\nof this check the unskilled labourers once more largely fell away\r\nfrom the Trade Union ranks. But just as 1873-74 left behind it a far\r\nmore permanent structure than 1833-34, so 1889-90 added even more\r\nthan 1873-74. The older Unions retained a large part, at any rate, of\r\nthe two hundred thousand members added to their ranks between 1887\r\nand 1891. But this numerical accession was of less importance than\r\nwhat may, without exaggeration, be termed the spiritual rebirth of\r\norganisations which were showing signs of decrepitude. The selfish\r\nspirit of exclusiveness which often marked the relatively well-paid\r\nengineer, carpenter, or boilermaker of 1880-85, gave place to a more\r\ngenerous recognition of the essential solidarity of the wage-earning\r\nclass. For example, the whole constitution of the Amalgamated Society\r\nof Engineers was, in 1892, revised for the express purpose of opening\r\nthe ranks of this most aristocratic of Unions to practically all\r\nthe mechanics in the innumerable branches of the engineering trade.\r\nSpecial facilities, moreover, were offered by this and the other\r\ngreat societies to old men and artisans earning wages insufficient\r\nto pay for costly friendly benefits. Nor was this all. The plumber\r\nvied with the engineer, the carpenter with the shipwright, in helping\r\nto form Unions among the labourers who work with or under them. And\r\nthe struggling Unions of women workers, which had originally some\r\ndifficulty in gaining admittance to Trades Councils and the Trade Union\r\nCongress, gratefully acknowledged a complete change in the attitude\r\nof their male fellow-workers. Not only was every assistance now given\r\nto the formation of special Unions among women workers, but women\r\nwere, in some cases, even welcomed as members by Unions of skilled\r\nartisans. A similar widening of sympathies and strengthening of bonds\r\nof fellowship was shown in the very general establishment of local\r\njoint committees of rival societies in the same trade, as well as of\r\nlarger federations. Robert Knight’s failures to form a federal council\r\nrepresenting the different Unions concerned in shipbuilding were\r\nretrieved in 1891 by his successful establishment of the Federation of\r\nthe Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades, which maintained a permanent\r\nexistence. The increased sense of solidarity among all sections of\r\nwage-earners, moreover, led to a greatly increased cordiality in\r\ninternational relations. The Coal-miners, the Glass Bottle Makers, and\r\nthe Textile Operatives established more or less formal federations\r\nwith their fellow-workers on the Continent of Europe. At the frequent\r\ninternational Congresses of these trades, as well as at the Socialist\r\nCongress of the workers of all countries, the representatives of the\r\nBritish Trade Unions largely laid aside that insular conceit which\r\nled the Parliamentary Committee of 1884 to declare that, owing to\r\nhis superiority, the British Trade Unionist derived no benefit from\r\ninternational relations. All this indicates a widening of the mental\r\nhorizon, a genuine elevation of the Trade Union Movement.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[511] See the _History of the British Trades Union Congress_, by W.\r\nJ. Davis, of which two volumes have been issued by the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee (1910 and 1916). William John Davis, one of the most\r\nsuccessful Trade Union administrators, was born in 1848, at Birmingham.\r\nIn 1872, when the National Society of Amalgamated Brassworkers was\r\nestablished in a trade hitherto entirely unorganised, he became General\r\nSecretary, a post which, except for one short interval, he has ever\r\nsince retained. Within six months he obtained from the employers the 15\r\nper cent increase which they had refused to the unorganised men, and\r\nestablished branches throughout the kingdom; and presently he completed\r\nthe difficult and laborious task of constructing a list of prices for\r\nall brasswork, for which he obtained the employers’ recognition. He\r\nwas elected to the Birmingham School Board in 1876, and to the Town\r\nCouncil in 1880. In 1883 he accepted appointment as Factory Inspector,\r\nbut six years later returned to his former post at the urgent request\r\nof the workmen, whose Union had in his absence sunk almost to nothing,\r\na condition from which he was able quickly to restore it to far more\r\nthan its highest previous strength; and to take on, in addition,\r\nthe secretaryship of the Amalgamated Metal Wire and Tube Makers’\r\nSociety. He was made a J.P. in 1906. Since 1881 he has been elected\r\ntwenty-six times to the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union\r\nCongress. He is the author, in addition to the _History of the British\r\nTrades Union Congress_, of _The Token Coinage of Warwickshire_ and\r\n_Nineteenth-Century Token Coinage_ (_The Life Story of W. J. Davis_, by\r\nW. B. Dalley, 1914).\r\n\r\n[512] In 1878, for instance, the Parliamentary Committee resolved that\r\nCongress ought not to interfere either between the English and Scottish\r\nTailors’ Societies or between the Boilermakers and the Platers’ Helpers.\r\n\r\n[513] The Congress, from 1871, annually elected a Parliamentary\r\nCommittee of ten members and a secretary. The members of the Committee\r\nwere always chosen from the officials of the more important Unions,\r\nwith a strong tendency to re-elect the same men year after year.\r\nBetween 1875 and 1889 the composition of the Committee was, in fact,\r\nscarcely changed, except through death or the promotion of members to\r\nGovernment appointments. George Potter was secretary from 1869-71;\r\nGeorge Odger in that year; and George Howell, afterwards M.P., from\r\n1872-75. Henry Broadhurst was for fourteen years annually re-elected\r\nsecretary without a contest, temporarily ceding the post, whilst Under\r\nSecretary of State for the Home Department in 1886, to George Shipton.\r\nHe was succeeded by Charles Fenwick, M.P., from 1890-93; then followed\r\nS. Woods, M.P., from 1894-1904; W. C. Steadman, M.P., from 1905-10; and\r\nthe Right Honourable C. W. Bowerman, M.P., from 1911 onwards.\r\n\r\n[514] Odger died in 1877, Guile in 1883, and Coulson (who had retired\r\nmany years before) in 1893.\r\n\r\n[515] To the counsels of Frederic Harrison, E. S. Beesly, H. Crompton,\r\nand A. J. Mundella was, from 1873, frequently added that of Mr.\r\n(afterwards Justice) R. S. Wright, who rendered invaluable service as a\r\ndraughtsman. Henry Crompton supplied us with the following account of\r\nthe subsequent separation between the Positivists and the Trade Union\r\nleaders:\r\n\r\n“In the year 1881 the connection of the Parliamentary Committee with\r\nthe Positivists was modified. There was not the same occasion for their\r\nservices as there had been. After 1883, in which year Mr. F. Harrison\r\nand Mr. H. Crompton attended the Congress by invitation, the connection\r\nceased altogether, though there was no breach of friendly relations.\r\nTill 1881 there had been entire agreement between them both as to\r\npolicy and means of action. The policy of the Positivists had been to\r\nsecure complete legal independence for workmen and their legitimate\r\ncombinations; to make them more respected and more conscious of their\r\nown work; to lift them to a higher moral level; that they should become\r\ncitizens ready and desirous to perform all the duties of citizenship.\r\nThe means employed was to consolidate and organise the power of the\r\nTrades Societies, through the institutions of the annual Congress and\r\nits Parliamentary Committee; to use this power, as occasion served, for\r\nthe general welfare as well as for trade interests. That the measures\r\nadopted or proposed by the Congress should be thoroughly discussed in\r\nthe branches, and delegates well posted in the principal questions. To\r\nexpress it shortly--organisation of collective labour and political\r\neducation of individual workmen.\r\n\r\n“The condition of this effective force was that, while it was being\r\nused in furtherance of political action, it should be kept quite clear\r\nand independent of political parties. The divergence came with the\r\nadvent of the Gladstonians to office. The Liberal Government began\r\na policy of coercion in Ireland. Combination was to be put down by\r\nthe very same mechanism which had been invented to repress labour\r\ncombinations--by the law of conspiracy. The very ruling of Baron\r\nBramwell as to the Tailors’ strike was employed to concoct a law to\r\nconvict Mr. Parnell and his coadjutors. As a result law was laid down\r\nby the Irish judges as to political combinations, which is binding in\r\nEngland, and has still to be resisted or abolished. The Positivists\r\nendeavoured to the utmost of their ability to rouse the working\r\nclasses to a sense of the danger of these proceedings, and to offer\r\nan uncompromising resistance to the suspension of the Habeas Corpus\r\nAct. The Parliamentary Committee would have none of it. They no doubt\r\nbelieved that the interests of their clients would be best served\r\nby a narrower policy, by seeking the help and favour of the eminent\r\nstatesmen in office. Instead of a compact, powerful force, holding the\r\nbalance between the parties and the key of the situation, dictating its\r\nterms, they preferred to be the tag end of a party. In the end they did\r\nnot get much, but the Congress was successfully captured and muzzled by\r\nthe Gladstonian Government.”\r\n\r\n[516] Report of Trades Union Congress, Dublin, 1880, p. 15.\r\n\r\n[517] The working of the Trade Union Act of 1871 revealed some\r\ntechnical defects in the law, which were remedied by an amending Act in\r\n1876 (39 and 40 Vic. c. 22). Rules for the execution of the Employers\r\nand Workmen Act were framed by the Lord Chancellor in the same year.\r\n\r\n[518] This defence of “common employment,” which practically deprived\r\nthe workman in large undertakings of any remedy in case of accidents\r\narising through negligence in the works, was first recognised in the\r\ncase of Priestly _v._ Fowler in 1837 (3 Meeson and Welby). Not until\r\n1868 did the House of Lords, as the final Court of Appeal, extend it\r\nto Scotland. The growth of colossal industrial undertakings, in which\r\nthousands of workmen were, technically, “in common employment,” made\r\nthe occasional harshness of the law still more invidious.\r\n\r\n[519] Act 43 and 44 Vic. c. 52 (1880).\r\n\r\n[520] The annual Parliamentary returns for the next fifteen years\r\nshowed that between three and four hundred cases came into court every\r\nyear, the amount of compensation actually awarded reaching between\r\n£7000 and £8000. But a large number of cases were compromised, or\r\nsettled without litigation. Meanwhile the relative number of accidents\r\ndiminished. Whereas in 1877 one railway employee in 95 was more or less\r\ninjured, in 1889 the proportion was only one in 195. Whereas between\r\n1873 and 1880 one coal-miner in 446 met his death annually, between\r\n1881 and 1890 the proportion was only one in 519; although there was\r\napparently less improvement, if any, as regards non-fatal accidents in\r\nthe mine.\r\n\r\n[521] By “contracting out” was meant an arrangement between employer\r\nand employed by which the latter relinquish the rights conferred upon\r\nthem by the Act, and often also their rights under the Common Law.\r\nThe Act was silent on the subject; but the judges decided, to the\r\ngreat surprise and dismay of the Trade Union leaders, that contracting\r\nout was permissible (see Griffiths _v._ Earl of Dudley, 9, Queen’s\r\nBench Division, 35). The usual form of “contracting out” was the\r\nestablishment of a workman’s insurance fund to which the workmen were\r\ncompelled to subscribe, and to which the employer also contributed.\r\nAmong the coal-miners, those of Lancashire, Somerset, and some\r\ncollieries in Wales generally contracted out. The employees of the\r\nLondon and North-Western, and London and Brighton Railway Companies\r\nalso contracted out. In one or two large undertakings in other\r\nindustries a similar course was followed. But in the vast majority\r\nof cases employers did not resort to this expedient. Particulars are\r\ngiven in the _Report and Evidence of the Select Committee on Employers’\r\nLiability_, 1866; the publications of the Royal Commission on Labour,\r\n1891-94; and _Miners’ Thrift and Employers’ Liability_, by G. L.\r\nCampbell (Wigan, 1891); and our _Industrial Democracy_.\r\n\r\nIn 1893-94 a further amending Bill passed the House of Commons which\r\nswept away the doctrine of common employment, and placed the workman\r\nwith regard to compensation on the same footing as any other person.\r\nA clause making void any agreement by which the workman forewent his\r\nright of action, or “contracted out,” was rejected by the House of\r\nLords, and the Bill was thereupon abandoned. The question was settled\r\nin 1896 by the passage, under the Unionist Government, of the Workmen’s\r\nCompensation Act, giving compensation in all cases, irrespective of the\r\nemployers’ default.\r\n\r\n[522] The legal advisers of the Junta realised that the triumph of\r\n1875, though it resulted in a distinct strengthening of the Trade Union\r\nposition, was mainly a moral victory. Though Trade Unions were made\r\nlegal, the law of conspiracy was only partially reformed, whilst that\r\nrelating to political combinations, unlawful assemblies, sedition,\r\netc., remained, as it still remains, untouched. Expert lawyers knew\r\nin how many ways prejudiced tribunals might at any time make the law\r\noppressive. The legal friends of Trade Unionism desired, therefore,\r\nto utilise the period of political quiet in simplifying the criminal\r\nlaw, and in removing as much of the obsolete matter as was possible.\r\nAnd though State Trials recommenced in Ireland in 1881, and criminal\r\nprosecutions of Trade Unionists continued in England down to 1891, the\r\ninterval had been well spent in clearing away some of the grosser evils.\r\n\r\n[523] In the proposed reform of the Jury laws, for instance, the\r\nParliamentary Committee for several years did not venture to ask\r\nexplicitly for that payment of jurymen which alone would enable working\r\nmen to serve, and contented themselves with suggesting a lowering of\r\nthe qualification for juryman. In 1876, indeed, John Burnett, then a\r\nprominent member of the Committee, strongly opposed the Payment of\r\nJurymen on the ground that it might create a class of professional\r\njurors (Trades Union Congress Report, 1876, p. 14).\r\n\r\n[524] See, for instance, the report of the 1876 Congress, p. 30; that\r\nof the 1882 Congress, p. 37; that of the 1883 Congress, p. 41; and\r\n_History of the British Trades Union Congress_, by W. J. Davis, vol.\r\ni., 1910.\r\n\r\n[525] In this connection may be mentioned the extensive agitation\r\npromoted by Samuel Plimsoll for further legislation to prevent the loss\r\nof life at sea. At the 1873 Trades Union Congress Plimsoll distributed\r\ncopies of his book, _Our Merchant Seamen_, and enlisted, during the\r\nnext three years, practically the whole political force of the Trade\r\nUnion Movement in support of his Merchant Shipping Acts Amendment\r\nBill. The “Plimsoll and Seamen’s Fund Committee,” of which George\r\nHowell became secretary, received large financial help from the Unions,\r\nthe South Yorkshire Miners’ Association voting, in 1873, a levy of a\r\nshilling per member, and contributing over £1000. The Parliamentary\r\nCommittee gave Plimsoll’s Bill a place in their programme for the\r\nGeneral Election of 1874, and this Trade Union support contributed\r\nlargely to Plimsoll’s success in passing a temporary Act in 1875, and\r\npermanent legislation in 1876, against the combined efforts of a strong\r\nConservative Government and the shipowners on both sides of the House.\r\n(See _Labour Legislation, Labour Movements, and Labour Leaders_, by G.\r\nHowell, 1902.)\r\n\r\n[526] Congress Reports, 1882 and 1883.\r\n\r\n[527] Parliamentary Committee’s Report, September 17, 1877.\r\n\r\n[528] That extending to factory scales and measures the provisions of\r\nthe Weights and Measures Act relating to inspection, etc.\r\n\r\n[529] The appointment was first offered to Broadhurst, who elected to\r\ncontinue his work as Secretary of the Parliamentary Committee, and who\r\nsuggested Prior (_Henry Broadhurst, the Story of his Life_, by himself,\r\n1901).\r\n\r\n[530] _Ibid._ p. 136.\r\n\r\n[531] It may be mentioned that the Trades Union Congress, which at\r\nfirst had welcomed addresses from the middle and upper class friends\r\nof Trade Unionism, was, between 1881 and 1883, gradually restricted to\r\nTrade Unionists. At the Nottingham Congress in 1883, where Frederic\r\nHarrison read a paper on the “History of Trade Unionism,” and Henry\r\nCrompton one on the “Codification of the Law,” when Frederic Harrison\r\nproposed to take part in the discussion on the Land Question, he was\r\nnot permitted to do so; and this rule has since been rigidly adhered\r\nto. At the Aberdeen Congress of 1884 Lord Rosebery was allowed to\r\ndeliver an address on the “Federalism of the Trades Union Congress,”\r\nbut this was the last time that any one has been invited to read a\r\npaper.\r\n\r\n[532] _Times_ leader on the Congress of Belfast, September 11, 1893,\r\nwhich deplores the remarkable “subservience to Mr. John Burns and\r\nhis friends” manifested by the Congress--a subservience marked by\r\nthe election of Mr. Burns for the Parliamentary Committee at the\r\nhead of the poll, and by the adoption of a programme which included\r\nthe nationalisation of the land and other means of production and\r\ndistribution.\r\n\r\n[533] The following description of the rise of the “New Unionism” of\r\n1889 is based on minutes and reports of Trade Union organisations, the\r\nfiles of _Justice_, the _Labour Elector_, the _Trade Unionist_, the\r\n_Cotton Factory Times_, the _Workman’s Times_, and other working-class\r\njournals. The documentary evidence has been elucidated and supplemented\r\nby the reminiscences of most of the principal actors in the movement,\r\nand by the personal recollections of the authors themselves, one of\r\nwhom, as a member of the Fabian Society, observed the transformation\r\nfrom the Socialist side, whilst the other, as a disciple of Herbert\r\nSpencer and a colleague of Charles Booth, was investigating the\r\ncontemporary changes from an Individualist standpoint.\r\n\r\n[534] See Mr. H. M. Hyndman’s _England for All_, 1881.\r\n\r\n[535] _Report of the International Trades Union Congress at Paris,\r\n1886_, by Adolphe Smith, 1886.\r\n\r\n[536] _Flint Glass Makers’ Magazine_, November 1884.\r\n\r\n[537] _Report of the Industrial Remuneration Conference_, 1885.\r\n\r\n[538] The results of twenty years of patient labour by Charles Booth\r\nand his assistants are embodied in the magnificent work, _Labour\r\nand Life of the People_ (London, 1st edition, 2 vols., 1889-91; 2nd\r\nedition, 4 vols., 1893), reissued in greatly enlarged form as _Life and\r\nLabour in London_, 18 vols.; _Pauperism and the Endowment of Old Age_\r\n(London, 1893); _The Aged Poor_ (1894); _Old Age and the Aged Poor_\r\n(1899); _Industrial Unrest and Trades Union Policy_ (1913). In _Charles\r\nBooth: a Memoir_ (1918) Mrs. Booth has given a personal biography\r\n(1840-1914) of a tireless investigator who, merely by the instrument of\r\nsocial diagnosis, got accomplished reforms of a magnitude that seemed\r\nat first wholly impracticable.\r\n\r\n[539] The funds of the Stonemasons had been completely exhausted by\r\nthe great strike of 1878. In January 1879 the Society determined,\r\non a proposition submitted by the Central Executive, to close all\r\npending disputes (including a general strike at Sheffield against a\r\nheavy reduction without due notice); and between that date and March\r\n1885, though many of the branches struggled manfully, and in some\r\ncases successfully, against repeated reductions of wages, increases\r\nof hours, or infringements of the local bye-laws, no strike whatever\r\nwas supported from the Society’s funds. The case of the Stonemasons is\r\ntypical of the other great trade friendly societies.\r\n\r\n[540] _What a Compulsory Eight Hours Working Day means to the Workers_,\r\nby Tom Mann (1886), 16 pp.\r\n\r\n[541] Mr. Tom Mann, one of the outstanding figures in the New\r\nUnionist Movement, was born at Foleshill, Warwickshire, in 1856, and\r\napprenticed in an engineering shop at Birmingham, whence he came to\r\nLondon in 1878, and joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers.\r\nEagerly pursuing his self-education, he became acquainted first\r\nwith the Co-operative Movement, and then with the writings of Henry\r\nGeorge. In 1884 he visited the United States, where he worked for six\r\nmonths. On his return he joined the Battersea Branch of the Social\r\nDemocratic Federation, and quickly became one of its leading speakers.\r\nHis experience of the evils of overtime made the Eight Hours Day a\r\nprominent feature in his lectures, and in 1886 he published his views\r\nin the pamphlet, _What a Compulsory Eight Hours Working Day means\r\nto the Workers_ (1886, 16 pp.), of which several editions have been\r\nprinted. In the same year he left his trade in order to devote himself\r\nto the provincial propaganda of the Social Democratic Federation,\r\nspending over two years incessantly lecturing, first about Tyneside,\r\nand then in Lancashire. Returning to London early in 1889, he assisted\r\nin establishing the Gas-workers’ Union and in organising the great\r\ndock strike, on the termination of which he was elected President of\r\nthe Dockers’ Union. For three years he applied himself to building\r\nup this organisation, deciding to resign in 1892, when he became a\r\ncandidate for the General Secretaryship of the Amalgamated Society\r\nof Engineers. After an exciting contest, during which he addressed\r\nmeetings of the members in all the great engineering centres, he failed\r\nof success only by 951 votes on a poll of 35,992. In the meantime\r\nhe had been appointed, in 1891, a member of the Royal Commission on\r\nLabour, to which he submitted a striking scheme for consolidating the\r\nwhole dock business of the port of London, by cutting a new channel for\r\nthe Thames across the Isle of Dogs. On the establishment in 1893 of\r\nthe London Reform Union he was appointed its secretary, a post which\r\nhe relinquished in 1894 on being elected secretary of the Independent\r\nLabour Party. This he presently relinquished to emigrate to New\r\nZealand; and there and in Australia he threw himself energetically\r\ninto Trade Union agitation. Returning to England in 1911, he became\r\na fervent advocate of Syndicalism; and then became an organiser for\r\nvarious General Labour Unions. In 1919 he was elected General Secretary\r\nof the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, after an exhaustive ballot of\r\nits great membership.\r\n\r\n[542] Article in _Justice_, September 3, 1887.\r\n\r\n[543] Mr. John Burns, in many respects the most striking personality in\r\nthe Labour Movement, was born at Battersea in 1859, and was apprenticed\r\nto a local engineering firm. Already during his apprenticeship he\r\nmade his voice heard in public, in 1877 being actually arrested for\r\npersistently speaking on Clapham Common, and in 1878 braving the\r\n“Jingo” mob at a Hyde Park demonstration. As soon as he was out of\r\nhis time (1879) he joined the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, and\r\nbecame an advocate of shorter hours of labour. An engagement as\r\nengineer on the Niger, West Africa, during 1880-81, gave him leisure\r\nto read, which he utilised by mastering Adam Smith and J. S. Mill.\r\nReturning to London, he worked side by side with Victor Delahaye, an\r\nex-Communard, who was afterwards one of the French representatives at\r\nthe Berlin Labour Conference, 1891, and with whom he had many talks\r\non the advancement of labour. In 1883 he joined the Social Democratic\r\nFederation, and at once became its leading working-class member,\r\nchampioning its cause, for instance, in an impressive speech at the\r\nIndustrial Remuneration Conference in 1885. In the same year he was\r\nelected by his district of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers as its\r\nrepresentative at the quinquennial delegate meeting of the Society,\r\nwhere he found himself the youngest member. At the General Election of\r\n1885 he stood as Socialist candidate for West Nottingham, receiving\r\n598 votes. For the next two years he became known as the leader of\r\nthe London “unemployed” agitation. His prosecution for sedition in\r\n1886 (with three other prominent members of the Social Democratic\r\nFederation) aroused considerable interest, and on his acquittal his\r\nspeech for the defence, _The Man with the Red Flag_, had a large sale\r\nin pamphlet form (1886; 16 pp.). At the prohibited demonstration at\r\nTrafalgar Square on “Bloody Sunday” (November 13, 1887), in conjunction\r\nwith Mr. Cunninghame Graham, M.P., he broke through the police line,\r\nfor which they were both sentenced to six weeks’ imprisonment. In\r\nJanuary 1889 he was elected for Battersea to the new London County\r\nCouncil, on which he became one of the most useful and influential\r\nmembers. His magnificent work in the dock strike and in organising the\r\nunskilled labourers is described in the text. At the General Election\r\nof 1892 he was chosen, by a large majority, M.P. for Battersea, and at\r\nthe Trades Union Congress in 1893 he received the largest number of\r\nvotes for the Parliamentary Committee, of which he accordingly became\r\nChairman. In 1906 he was appointed President of the Local Government\r\nBoard in Sir H. Campbell-Bannerman’s Government, with a seat in the\r\nCabinet--thus becoming the first working-man Cabinet Minister--a post\r\nwhich he held until August 1914, when he resigned on the outbreak of\r\nwar. He retained his seat in Parliament until 1918, when he retired.\r\n\r\n[544] Address to Trade Unionists in _Justice_, January 24, 1885.\r\n\r\n[545] Weiler was the delegate of the Alliance Cabinetmakers’ Society,\r\nand came from London. The Congress Report gives the following account\r\nof his paper: “After reviewing the position of the working classes\r\nunder the present system, and comparing it with the state of things\r\neighty years ago, he contended that the best means of bettering their\r\nposition was to reduce the hours of toil. The result of this would\r\nbe, first, to give every worker a better chance of employment, and\r\nthus lessen that sort of competition which was caused by hunger and\r\nwant; secondly, it would give them time and opportunity for rest and\r\namusement, and that cultivation of their minds which would enable\r\nthem to prepare themselves for the time when the present system of\r\nproduction would collapse, and the time of this collapse was not so\r\ndistant as some supposed.” The paper was received with much applause,\r\nand Weiler received the thanks of Congress. No resolution was passed.\r\n\r\n[546] _History of the British Trades Union Congress_, by W. J. Davis,\r\nvol. i. p. 133.\r\n\r\n[547] The Return moved for by George Howell regarding the Woolwich and\r\nEnfield engineering works showed that, during 1884 and 1885, more than\r\nhalf the artisans worked overtime, the average per week for each man\r\nvarying from 9.4 hours in some shops to 17.8 in others.\r\n\r\n[548] 11,966 of its members voted for an Eight Hours Day, and of these\r\n9209 declared in favour of the enforcement of the eight hours limit by\r\nlaw. The total votes given for an Eight Hours Law was 17,267; against\r\nit, 3819.\r\n\r\n[549] The votes in favour of an Eight Hours Day were 39,656; against\r\nit, 67,390, of which 56,541 were cast on behalf of the Cotton-spinners\r\nand Weavers. In favour of an Eight Hours Law, 28,511; against it,\r\n12,283. The votes of the different trades, and a summary of the\r\nCongress proceedings on this subject, are given in _The Eight Hours\r\nDay_, by Sidney Webb and Harold Cox, 1891; see also _History of the\r\nBritish Trades Union Congress_, by W. J. Davis, vol. ii. pp. 7-8.\r\n\r\n[550] The clause was moved by S. Williamson, Liberal Member for\r\nKilmarnock, and seconded by J. H. C. Hozier, Conservative Member for\r\nSouth Lanarkshire. It received no support from the “Labour Members,”\r\nand was rejected by 159 to 104. See the _Eight Hours Day_, by Webb and\r\nCox, 1891, p. 23.\r\n\r\n[551] The “National Conferences” of the miners are a feature peculiar\r\nto the industry. Besides the periodical gatherings of the separate\r\nfederations, the miners, since 1863, have had frequent conferences\r\nof delegates from all the organised districts in the kingdom. These\r\nconferences were, until 1889, held under the auspices of the National\r\nUnion; subsequently they were summoned by the Miners’ Federation. The\r\nmeetings, from which reporters are now excluded, are consultative\r\nonly, and their decisions are not authoritative until adopted by the\r\nseparate organisations. See _Die Ordnung des Arbeitsverhältnisses in\r\nden Kohlengruben von Northumberland und Durham_, by Dr. Emil Auerbach\r\n(Leipzig, 1890, 268 pp.).\r\n\r\n[552] The “Fair Trade” attack had arisen in the following manner. At\r\nthe Bristol Congress in 1878, certain delegates, who were strongly\r\nsuspected of being the paid agents of the organisation then agitating\r\nfor the abolition of the foreign bounties on sugar, attempted to force\r\nthis question upon the Congress, and made a serious disturbance.\r\nThese delegates afterwards became the paid representatives of the\r\n“Fair Trade League,” an association avowedly composed of landlords\r\nand capitalists with the object of securing a reimposition of import\r\nduties. The Front Bench steadfastly refused to allow the Congress to be\r\nused for promotion of this object, and were exposed in return to what\r\nthe Congress in 1882 declared to be “a cowardly, false, and slanderous\r\nattack, ... an attempt at moral assassination.” Instead of fighting\r\nthe question of Free Trade _versus_ Protection, the emissaries of the\r\nFair Trade League developed an elaborate system of personal defamation,\r\ndirected against Broadhurst, Howell, Shipton, and other leaders. For\r\ninstance, Broadhurst’s administration of the Gas Stokers’ Relief Fund\r\nin 1872 was made the pretext for vague insinuations of malversation\r\nwhich were scattered broadcast through the Trade Union world. At the\r\nCongress of 1881 the “Fair Trade” delegates were expelled, on it\r\nbeing proved that their expenses were not paid by the Trade Union\r\norganisations which they nominally represented. A renewed attack on the\r\nCongress of 1882 ended in the triumphant victory of the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee, the complete exoneration of Broadhurst and his colleagues,\r\nand the final discomfiture of the “Fair Trade” delegates. See _Henry\r\nBroadhurst: the Story of his Life_, by himself, 1901; _History of the\r\nBritish Trades Union Congress_, by W. J. Davis, vol. i., 1910.\r\n\r\n[553] Report to Congress of 1884. This is another instance of the\r\nabandonment of the more generous views of Applegarth and Odger.\r\n\r\n[554] Mr. Drummond, who resigned his secretaryship in 1892, was in the\r\nfollowing year appointed to the staff of the Labour Department of the\r\nBoard of Trade, from which he retired in 1918.\r\n\r\n[555] See its Circular of June 1886.\r\n\r\n[556] Some isolated protests against the employment of non-Unionists\r\nare of earlier date. Thus, the minutes of the Birmingham Trades Council\r\nshow that, on July 3, 1880, at the instance of a painters’ delegate,\r\nit passed a resolution protesting against the employment of “non-Union\r\nand incompetent men” by the local hospital. And in the same month the\r\nWolverhampton Trades Council had successfully protested against the\r\nemployment of non-Unionist printers upon a new Liberal newspaper about\r\nto be established.\r\n\r\n[557] The chief medium for the attack was the _Labour Elector_, a penny\r\nweekly journal published, from September 1888 to April 1890, by Mr.\r\nH. H. Champion, an ex-officer of the Royal Artillery, who (prosecuted\r\nin 1886, as we have seen, with H. M. Hyndman, J. Burns, and Williams,\r\nfor sedition) had at one time been a leading member of the Social\r\nDemocratic Federation, from which he was excluded on a difference of\r\npolicy. He afterwards emigrated to Melbourne, where he still (1920)\r\nresides.\r\n\r\n[558] _Henry Broadhurst: the Story of his Life_, by himself, 1901, pp.\r\n218-24; _History of the British Trades Union Congress_, by W. J. Davis,\r\nvol. i., 1910.\r\n\r\n[559] The men employed by two of the gas companies in London, and most\r\nof those engaged by provincial municipalities, have retained this boon.\r\nBut in December 1889 the South Metropolitan Gas Company insisted,\r\nafter a serious strike, on a return to the twelve hours’ shift. A\r\nscheme of profit-sharing was used to break up their men’s Union\r\nand induce them to accept individual engagements inconsistent with\r\nCollective Bargaining. This example (which is not unique) confirmed\r\nthe Trade Unions in their objection to schemes of “Profit-sharing” or\r\n“Co-partnership.”\r\n\r\n[560] This strike had the good fortune to find contemporary historians\r\nwho were themselves concerned in all the phases of the struggle. _The\r\nStory of the Dockers’ Strike_, by Mr. (afterwards Sir) Hubert Llewellyn\r\nSmith and Vaughan Nash (1890, 190 pp.), gives not only a detailed\r\nchronicle of the highly dramatic proceedings, but also a useful\r\ndescription of the organisation of the London Docks.\r\n\r\n[561] This movement was much assisted by the “Red Van” campaigns of\r\nthe English Land Restoration League, 1891-94, which coupled Land\r\nNationalisation propaganda with the formation of local unions of the\r\nlabourers in the Southern and Midland Counties of England. In the\r\nagricultural depression of 1894-95, when staffs were further reduced\r\nand wages again lowered, nearly all these new Unions sank to next to\r\nnothing, or entirely dissolved. Most information as to them is to be\r\ngained from _The Church Reformer_ for 1891-95; _History of the English\r\nAgricultural Labourer_, by W. Hasbach, 1907; and Ernest Selley’s\r\n_Village Trade Unions of Two Centuries_, 1919.\r\n\r\n[562] Short-lived and turbulent combinations among seamen have existed\r\nat various periods for the past hundred years, notably between 1810 and\r\n1825, on the north-east coast, where many sailors’ benefit clubs were\r\nalso established. In 1851, again, a widespread national organisation\r\nof seamen is said to have existed, having twenty-five branches between\r\nPeterhead and London, and numbering 30,000 members. This appears to\r\nhave been a loose federation of practically autonomous port Unions,\r\nwhich for some years kept up a vigorous agitation against obnoxious\r\nclauses in the Merchant Shipping Acts of 1851-54, and fought the\r\nsailors’ grievances in the law courts. In 1879 the existing North\r\nof England Sailors and Sea-going Firemen’s Friendly Association was\r\nestablished, but failed to maintain itself outside Sunderland. In\r\n1887 its most vigorous member, J. Havelock Wilson, convinced that\r\nnothing but a national organisation would be effective, started\r\nthe National Amalgamated Sailors and Firemen’s Union, which his\r\nable and pertinacious “lobbying” made, for some years, an effective\r\nParliamentary force.\r\n\r\n[563] Address to members in First Half-Yearly Report (London, 1889).\r\nThe spirit of the uprising is well given in _The New Trade Unionism_,\r\nby Tom Mann and Ben Tillett, 1890; on which George Shipton was moved to\r\nwrite _A Reply to Messrs. Tom Mann and Ben Tillett’s Pamphlet entitled\r\n“The New Trade Unionism,”_ 1890.\r\n\r\n[564] _Speech delivered by John Burns on the Liverpool Congress,\r\nSeptember 21, 1890_ (1890, 32 pp.).\r\n\r\n[565] _Justice_, November 7, 1885.\r\n\r\n[566] Printed in _Justice_, September 6, 1884.\r\n\r\n[567] “The Decay of Trade Unions,” by H.

The identity of purpose and methods\r\nbetween the two movements is indeed elsewhere directly asserted; see\r\n“Socialism in ’34,” _ibid._, April 19, 1884, and the extracts from the\r\nOwenite journals in the issue for July 25, 1885.\r\n\r\n[571] _Ibid._, August 6, 1887.\r\n\r\n[572] _Justice_, July 25, 1885.\r\n\r\n[573] From 1889 onwards the columns of _Justice_ abound in abuse and\r\ndenunciation of the leaders of the New Unionism. We may cite, not so\r\nmuch because it summarises this denunciation and abuse, but because of\r\nthe details of the movement that it incidentally gives, _The Rise and\r\nProgress of a Right Honourable_, by Joseph Burgess (1911).\r\n\r\n[574] In this development some share is to be attributed to the work\r\nof the Fabian Society, which, established in 1883, began in 1887 to\r\nexercise a growing influence on working-class opinion. The publication,\r\nin 1889, of _Fabian Essays in Socialism_, the circulation between\r\n1887 and 1893 of three-quarters of a million copies of its series\r\nof “Fabian tracts,” and the delivery of several thousand lectures a\r\nyear in London and other industrial centres, contributed largely to\r\nsubstitute a practical and constitutional policy of Collectivist reform\r\nfor the earlier revolutionary propaganda. Tom Mann, Ben Tillett, and\r\nother Trade Union leaders were, from 1889 onwards, among the members\r\nof the parent Fabian Society, whilst the ninety independent local\r\nFabian Societies in the provincial centres usually included many of the\r\ndelegates to the local Trades Councils. Some account of the Society and\r\nits work will be found in _Zum socialen Frieden_, by Dr. von Schulze\r\nGaevernitz (Leipzig, 1891, 2 vols.); in _Englische Socialreformer_, by\r\nDr. M. Grunwald (Leipzig, 1897); in _La Société Fabienne_, by Edouard\r\nPfeiffer (Paris, 1911); in _Geschichte des Socialismus in England_,\r\nby M.

Some of the branches of the\r\nNational Union of Gas-workers and General Labourers promptly added\r\nlocal benefit funds, and the addition of Accident Benefit by the whole\r\nsociety was presently adopted.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nTHE TRADE UNION WORLD\r\n\r\n[1890-1894]\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen we were engaged, between 1890 and 1894, in investigating the\r\nhistory and organisation of all the several Unions, no complete\r\nstatistics as to the extent of the membership were in existence. We\r\naccordingly sought to obtain, not only an analysis of the Trade Union\r\nworld as it then was, but also a complete census of Trade Unionism\r\nfrom one end of the kingdom to the other. We retain this analysis\r\npractically as it stood in the first edition of the book in 1894, as a\r\nrecord of the position as it then was--in subsequent chapters tracing\r\nthe principal changes and developments of the last thirty years.\r\n\r\nTo deal first with the aggregate membership, we were convinced in\r\n1894 that, although a certain number of small local societies might\r\nhave escaped our notice, we had included every Union then existing\r\nwhich had as many as 1000 members, as well as many falling below that\r\nfigure. From these researches we estimated that the total Trade Union\r\nmembership in the United Kingdom at the end of 1892 certainly exceeded\r\n1,500,000 and probably did not reach 1,600,000. Our estimate was\r\npresently confirmed. Working upon the data thus supplied, the Labour\r\nDepartment of the Board of Trade extended its investigations, and now\r\nrecords a Trade Union membership for 1892 of 1,502,358.[577] The Trade\r\nUnionists of 1892 numbered, therefore, about 4 per cent of the Census\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nBut to gauge the strength of the Trade Union world of 1892 we had to\r\ncompare the number of Trade Unionists, not with the total population,\r\nbut with that portion of it which might conceivably be included within\r\nits boundaries. Thus at the outset we had to ignore the propertied\r\nclasses, the professions, the employers and the brain-workers of every\r\nkind, and confine our attention exclusively to the wage-earners engaged\r\nin manual work. Even of the working-class so defined we could exclude\r\nthe children and the youths under twenty-one, who are not usually\r\neligible for Trade Union membership. The women present a greater\r\ndifficulty to the statistician. The adult female wage-earners engaged\r\nin manual labour in 1891 were estimated to number between two and three\r\nmillions, of which only about 100,000 were even nominally within the\r\nTrade Union ranks. To what extent the men’s Trade Unionism was weakened\r\nby its failure to enrol the women workers was a matter of dispute. From\r\nthe industrial point of view the answer depends on complicated economic\r\nconsiderations, such as the extent to which women compete with men\r\nin particular industries, or women’s trades with those in which men\r\nare employed. Owing to the exclusion of women from the Parliamentary\r\nfranchise until 1918 their absence from the Trade Union world detracted\r\nlittle from its political force. We have dealt elsewhere[578] with the\r\nrelation of women workers to the Trade Union organisation. Meanwhile we\r\nomit the women as well as the young persons under twenty-one from our\r\nestimate of the place occupied by Trade Unionism in working-class life.\r\n\r\nWe know of no exact statistics as to the total numbers of the\r\nmanual-working class. The figures collected by Leone Levi, and\r\nthose of Sir Robert Giffen, together with the inferences to be\r\ndrawn from the census and from Charles Booth’s works, led us to the\r\nconclusion--at best only hypothetical--that of the nine millions\r\nof men over twenty-one years of age in 1891, about seven millions\r\nbelonged to the manual-working class. Out of every hundred of the\r\npopulation of all ages we could roughly estimate that about eighteen\r\nare in this sense working men adults. Accepting for the moment this\r\nhypothetical estimate, we arrived at the conclusion that the Trade\r\nUnionists numbered at this date about 20 per cent of the adult male\r\nmanual-working class, or, roughly, one man in five.\r\n\r\nBut this revised percentage is itself misleading. If the million and a\r\nhalf Trade Unionists were evenly distributed among all occupations and\r\nthrough all districts, a movement which comprised only 20 per cent of\r\nworking men would be of slight economic or industrial importance, and\r\nof no great weight in the political world. What gave the Trade Union\r\nMovement its significance even thirty years ago and transformed these\r\nmillion and a half units into an organised world of their own, was the\r\nmassing of Trade Unionists in certain industries and districts in such\r\na way as to form a powerful majority of the working-class world. The\r\nTrade Unionists were aggregated in the thriving industrial districts of\r\nthe North of England. The seven counties of England north of the Humber\r\nand the Dee contained at least 726,000 members of trade societies, or\r\nalmost half of the total for the United Kingdom. At a considerable\r\ndistance from these followed the industrial Midlands, where the seven\r\ncounties of Leicester, Derby, Notts, Warwick, Gloucester, Northampton,\r\nand Stafford included a total Trade Union membership of at least\r\n210,000, whilst South Wales, including Monmouthshire, counted another\r\n89,000 members of trade societies. The vast agglomeration of the London\r\ndistrict, in which we must reckon Middlesex, the subsidiary boroughs of\r\nWest Ham, Croydon, Richmond, and Kingston, as well as Bromley in Kent,\r\nyielded not more than 194,000 Trade Unionists.\r\n\r\nThese four districts, comprising nearly 21,000,000 inhabitants, or\r\nrather more than two-thirds of the population of England and Wales,\r\npossessed in 1892 twelve-thirteenths of its Trade Unionists. The total\r\nTrade Union membership in the remainder of the country, with its\r\n8,000,000 of population, did not exceed 105,000, largely labourers.\r\nThe only county in England in which in 1892 we found no trace of\r\nTrade Union organisation was Rutland, which did not, at this date,\r\ncontain a single branch of any Union whatsoever. But Huntingdonshire,\r\nHerefordshire, and Dorsetshire, containing together over 350,000\r\ninhabitants, included, according to our estimate, only about 710 Trade\r\nUnionists between them. Scotland, with four millions of population,\r\nhad 147,000 Trade Unionists, nearly all aggregated in the narrow\r\nindustrial belt between the Clyde and the Forth, two-thirds of the\r\ntotal, indeed, belonging to Glasgow and the neighbouring industrial\r\ncentres. Ireland, with three-quarters of a million more population,\r\ncounted but 40,000, nine-tenths of whom belonged to Dublin, Belfast,\r\nCork, and Limerick.\r\n\r\nOf particular counties, Northumberland and Durham at that date took\r\nthe lead, closely followed by Lancashire. The table on following\r\npage supplies particulars of this date for the strongest Trade Union\r\ncounties in England and Wales.\r\n\r\nThis superficial investigation shows us at once that Trade Unionism\r\ncoincided in 1892, as it does in 1920, in the main with density of\r\npopulation. The thinly peopled plains of Dorsetshire, the Highlands of\r\nScotland, the West of Ireland, the Cumberland and Westmorland Hills,\r\nwere practically devoid of Trade Unionism; the valleys of the Tyne and\r\nTees, Lancashire and London, and the busy industrial villages of the\r\nMidlands showed a comparatively high percentage. But the correspondence\r\nof Trade Unionism with density of population is by no means exact.\r\nOldham, for instance, with a population of 201,153, had 25,000 male\r\nUnionists,[579] or 12.43 per cent, whereas Birmingham (including the\r\nsuburbs of Aston, Handsworth, and Solihull), with 621,253, had only\r\n26,000, or 4.19 per cent. Newcastle (including Gateshead), with 328,066\r\ninhabitants, had 26,500 Trade Unionists, or 8.08 per cent, whilst Leeds\r\n(including Wortley, Hunslet, and Burley) had but 16,000 to a population\r\nof 415,243, or 3.85 per cent. And, most striking exception of all,\r\nthe crowded five and a half millions of the Metropolitan area had but\r\n194,000 Trade Unionists, or only 3.52 per cent of its population,\r\nwhilst Lancashire, even including its northern moorlands and its wide\r\nagricultural districts, had 332,000 for less than four millions of\r\npeople, or 8.63 per cent of its population. Reckoning that 18 out of\r\nevery 100 of the population are adult male workmen, Trade Unionism thus\r\ncounted among its adherents in some counties over 50 per cent of the\r\ntotal number of working men.\r\n\r\n _Table showing, for certain counties in England, and for\r\n   South Wales, the total population in 1891, the ascertained\r\n   number of Trade Unionists in 1892, and the percentage to\r\n   population in each case.

To the student of\r\nTrade Union statistics a more particular enumeration may be useful.\r\nBefore we attempt to picture Trade Union life, we shall therefore\r\ndevote a dozen pages (which the general reader may with a clear\r\nconscience skip) to the dry facts of organisation in each of the eight\r\ngreat divisions into which we distributed the Trade Union membership of\r\n1892.\r\n\r\nThe first division, comprising all the numerous ramifications of\r\nthe engineering, metal-working, and shipbuilding trades, was then\r\ncharacterised by old-established and highly developed national Unions,\r\nwith large membership, centralised administration, and extensive\r\nfriendly benefits. The 287,000 Trade Unionists in this division\r\nwere enrolled in over 260 separate societies, but almost one-half\r\nbelonged to one or other of four great national organisations, the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Engineers (established 1851), the United\r\nSociety of Boilermakers and Iron Shipbuilders (established 1832),[583]\r\nthe Friendly Society of Ironfounders of England, Ireland, and Wales\r\n(established 1809), and the Associated Society of Shipwrights, a\r\nbelated amalgamation formed in 1882 by the many ancient local\r\nUnions of wooden shipbuilders. Of these great Unions, that of the\r\nBoilermakers, with 39,000 members, was incomparably the strongest,\r\nhaving no rival for the allegiance of its trade and including\r\npractically the whole body of skilled workmen engaged in iron\r\nshipbuilding and boilermaking from one end of the United Kingdom to\r\nthe other. The great Unions of Ironfounders and Shipwrights, with\r\nrespectively 15,000 and 14,000 members, were not quite so universal as\r\nthe Boilermakers. The Associated Society of Ironmoulders (Ironfounders)\r\nof Scotland (established 1831), with 6000 members and a few minor\r\nUnions of less skilled ironfounders, maintained separate organisations;\r\nwhilst the Shipwrights’ Provident Union of the Port of London\r\n(established 1824, 1400 members), the Liverpool Trade and Friendly\r\nAssociation of Shipwrights (established 1800, 1400 members), and a few\r\nother old-fashioned port Unions still held aloof from the Shipwrights’\r\namalgamation.[584] The Amalgamated Society of Engineers, the largest\r\ncentralised Trade Union in the kingdom, with 66,000 members at home\r\nand 5000 abroad, towered over all its rivals, but had to compete\r\nwith compact sectional or local Unions, admitting one or more of the\r\nnumerous classes of workmen in the engineering and machine-making\r\ntrade.[585] Among the actual producers of iron and steel, the British\r\nSteel Smelters’ Association (established 1886), with 2400 members,\r\noriginally a Scotch Union, was extending all over the kingdom; whilst\r\nthe Associated Society of Iron and Steel Workers (established 1862),\r\nwith 1250 members.\r\n\r\n7800 members, occupied a unique position in the Trade Union world\r\nfrom its long and constant devotion to the sliding scale. The tin and\r\nhollow-ware workers,[586] the chippers and drillers, the Sheffield\r\ncutlers, and the craftsmen in precious metals were split up into\r\ninnumerable local societies, with little federal union.\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to notice the large proportion which this division of\r\nTrade Unionists in Scotland bore to the total for that country. Whilst\r\nin England and Wales it formed only one-sixth of the aggregate number,\r\nin Scotland it measured nearly one-third, almost entirely centred about\r\nGlasgow.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Table showing the approximate number of Trade Unionists in each group\r\nof the Engineering and Shipbuilding Trades._\r\n\r\n -----------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+---------\r\n           Trade.             |  England  | Scotland. | Ireland. |  Total.\r\n                              | and Wales.|           |          |\r\n -----------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+---------\r\n Engineers and Machine Makers |   74,000  |   8,250   |  2,750   |   85,000\r\n Smiths and Farriers          |    7,350  |   2,250   |    300   |    9,900\r\n Brass and Copper Workers     |   13,350  |   2,000   |    150   |   15,500\r\n Sheet Metal Workers          |   16,000  |   1,300   |    200   |   17,500\r\n Ironfounders and Core-makers |   15,500  |   7,250   |    500   |   23,250\r\n Shipbuilding and             |           |           |          |\r\n   Boiler making              |   45,500  |  13,250   |  3,600   |   62,350\r\n Iron and Steel Smelters.     |   23,500  |   1,500   |   ...    |   25,000\r\n Workers in Precious Metals   |    3,500  |    ...    |   ...    |    3,500\r\n Sundry Metal Workers         |   34,750  |   9,500   |    750   |   45,000\r\n                              | --------  |  ------   | ------   | --------\r\n       Totals                 |  233,450  |  45,300   |  8,250   |  287,000\r\n -----------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+---------\r\n\r\nThe organisation of Builders and Furniture Makers resembled in many\r\nrespects that of the Engineers and Shipbuilders. The 148,000 Trade\r\nUnionists in this division were sorted into 120 separate Unions; but\r\nagain we find one-half of them belonging to one or other of three\r\ncentralised Trade Friendly Societies of national scope. Of these\r\nthe Friendly Society of Operative Stonemasons (established 1832,\r\n16,000 members) was the most powerful, having practically no rival\r\nthroughout England or Ireland, and maintaining friendly relations with\r\nthe corresponding United Operative Masons’ Association of Scotland\r\n(established 1831, 5000 members). But the largest and richest Union in\r\nthis division was the Amalgamated Society of Carpenters and Joiners\r\n(established 1860, 34,000 members at home and 4000 abroad). Although\r\nthis Society could count but a small proportion of the total number\r\nof carpenters in the kingdom, it included three-fourths of those who\r\nwere Trade Unionists, the remaining fourth being divided between the\r\nAssociated Carpenters and Joiners of Scotland (established 1861, 6000\r\nmembers), the old General Union of Carpenters and Joiners of England\r\n(established 1827, 4000 members), and a few tiny trade clubs in the\r\nMetropolis which had refused to merge themselves in either of the\r\nnational organisations. The Bricklayers were in much the same position\r\nas the Carpenters. The Operative Bricklayers’ Society (established\r\n1848, 22,000 members) included three-fourths of the Trade Unionists,\r\nthe remainder being found either in the United Operative Bricklayers’\r\nTrade, Accident, and Burial Society (established 1832, 2500 members),\r\nor in a few isolated local trade clubs in Scotland and Ireland. Of the\r\nother Unions in the Building Trades, the United Operative Plumbers’\r\nAssociation of Great Britain and Ireland (established 1832, reorganised\r\n1865, 6500 members) was by far the most effective and compact, and\r\nwas specially interesting as retaining practically the federal\r\nconstitution of the Builders’ Union of 1830-34. With the exception of\r\nthe United Operative Plumbers’ Association of Scotland (established\r\n1872, 700 members), a small society resulting from a secession, no\r\nrival organisation existed. On the other hand, the Painters, Slaters,\r\nPacking-case Makers, Upholsterers, and French Polishers were split up\r\ninto numberless small Unions, whilst the Cabinetmakers and Plasterers\r\nhad each one considerable organisation[587] and several smaller\r\nsocieties, which, however, included but a small proportion of the trade.\r\n\r\n_Table showing the approximate number of Trade Unionists in the various\r\nbranches of the Building and Furniture Trades._\r\n\r\n -----------------------+----------+-----------+----------+---------\r\n           Trade.       | England. | Scotland. | Ireland. |  Total.\r\n                        |and Wales.|           |          |\r\n -----------------------+----------+-----------+----------+---------\r\n Stonemasons            |   16,750 |   8,250   |     250  |   25,250\r\n Bricklayers            |   24,000 |     700   |   2,300  |   27,000\r\n Carpenters             |   33,000 |   7,850   |   3,250  |   44,100\r\n Cabinetmakers          |    7,200 |   2,000   |     300  |    9,500\r\n Sawyers and other      |          |           |          |\r\n   Wood-workers         |    4,250 |     350   |     150  |    4,750\r\n Plasterers             |    7,500 |   1,000   |     500  |    9,000\r\n Painters               |   12,400 |   2,150   |   1,000  |   15,550\r\n Plumbers               |    5,400 |   1,200   |     400  |    7,000\r\n Upholsterers and       |          |           |          |\r\n   French Polishers     |    2,500 |     450   |     300  |    3,250\r\n Sundry Building Trades |    1,500 |   1,000   |     100  |    2,600\r\n                        | -------- |  ------   |  ------  | --------\r\n       Totals           |  114,500 |  24,950   |   8,550  |  148,000\r\n -----------------------+----------+-----------+----------+---------\r\n\r\nThe Miners and Quarrymen, comprising about sixty-five societies,\r\nwere in 1892 the best organised of the eight great divisions into\r\nwhich we classified the Trade Union forces. Among the coalminers\r\nthe “county,” or district Union, without friendly benefits, was the\r\npredominating type. Nearly two-thirds of the whole 347,000 Trade\r\nUnionists in this division were gathered into the Miners’ Federation\r\nof Great Britain (established 1888), a federal Union comprising about\r\ntwenty independent organisations, some of which, like the Yorkshire\r\nMiners’ Association (established 1858, 55,000 members), were highly\r\ncentralised, whilst others, like the Lancashire Miners’ Federation\r\n(established 1881, 43,000 members), were themselves federal bodies. The\r\nMiners’ Federation, whilst not interfering with the financial autonomy\r\nor internal administration of its constituent bodies, effectively\r\ncentralised the industrial and Parliamentary policy of the whole army\r\nof its members from Fife to Somerset. Outside the Federation at this\r\ndate stood the powerful and compact Northumberland Miners’ Mutual\r\nConfident Association (established 1863, 17,000 members), and Durham\r\nMiners’ Association (established 1869, 50,000 members), together with\r\nthe solid little Mid and West Lothian Miners’ Association (established\r\n1885, 3600 members), and the loose organisations of Sliding Scale\r\ncontributors which then figured as Trade Unions in South Wales.[588]\r\nThe coal and iron miners of the West of Scotland had scarcely got\r\nbeyond the ephemeral pit club and occasional Strike Union. Among\r\nthe tin, lead, and copper miners Trade Unionism, as far as we can\r\nascertain, was absolutely unknown.\r\n\r\n_Table showing the approximate number of Trade Unionists among the\r\npersons engaged in or about Mines and Quarries._\r\n\r\n ---------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n           Trade.           |  England. | Scotland. | Ireland. |   Total.\r\n                            | and Wales.|           |          |\r\n ---------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n Coal and Iron Miners       |  301,000  |  17,500   |    ...   |  318,500\r\n Colliery Enginemen         |    5,000  |   1,500   |    ...   |    6,500\r\n Cokemen, Overmen, Colliery |           |           |          |\r\n   Mechanics, &c.           |    9,250  |     500   |    ...   |    9,750\r\n Quarrymen                  |   10,500  |    ...    |    ...   |   10,500\r\n Shale Oil Workers          |     ...   |   1,750   |    ...   |    1,750\r\n                            | --------  |  ------   |  ------  | --------\r\n       Totals               |  325,750  |  21,250   |    ...   |  347,000\r\n ---------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n\r\nThe salient fact of Trade Unionism among the textile operatives in 1892\r\nwas that effective organisation was nearly confined to the workers\r\nin cotton, who contributed at least two-thirds of the 200,000 Trade\r\nUnionists in this division. Like the Miners the Cotton Operatives\r\nhave always shown a strong preference for federal Associations with\r\nexclusively trade objects. The powerful Amalgamated Association of\r\nOperative Cotton-spinners (established 1853), a federal Union of\r\n19,500 members comprising forty separate district associations,\r\njoined with its sister federations, the Northern Counties Amalgamated\r\nAssociation of Weavers (established 1884, 71,000 members) and the\r\nAmalgamated Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives (31,000\r\nmembers, established 1886), in the United Textile Factory Workers’\r\nAssociation (established 1886). This Association formed exclusively\r\nfor Parliamentary purposes, focussed the very considerable political\r\ninfluence of 125,000 organised cotton operatives in Lancashire,\r\nCheshire, and Yorkshire, and was, next to the Miners’ Federation, by\r\nfar the most powerful Trade Union organisation in the country.[589]\r\n\r\nThe highly developed organisation of the Cotton Operatives contrasted\r\nwith the feebleness of the Woollen-workers. In the other branches of\r\ntextile manufacture the extreme localisation of the separate industries\r\nhad given rise to isolated county or district organisations of lace,\r\nhosiery, silk, flax, or carpet-workers usually confined to small areas,\r\nand exercising comparatively little influence in the Trade Union world.\r\nIncomparably the strongest among them was the Amalgamated Society of\r\nOperative Lacemakers (3500 members), which comprised practically all\r\nthe adult male workers in the Nottingham machine-lace trade. If we\r\nexclude the constituent organisations of the United Textile Factory\r\nWorkers’ Association, the separate Unions in the various branches of\r\nthe textile industry numbered 115.\r\n\r\n_Table showing the approximate number of Trade Unionists in the various\r\nbranches of the Textile Manufacture._\r\n\r\n ----------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+---------\r\n           Trade.            |  England. | Scotland. | Ireland. |   Total.\r\n                             | and Wales.|           |          |\r\n ----------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+---------\r\n Cotton-spinners             |   19,500  |     ...   |    ...   |   19,500\r\n Cotton-weavers              |   82,500  |      500  |    ...   |   83,000\r\n Cotton Card-room Operatives |   31,000  |     ...   |    ...   |   31,000\r\n Woollen-workers             |    6,000  |    9,500  |    ...   |   15,500\r\n Woolsorters, Combers, &c.   |    2,500  |     ...   |    ...   |    2,500\r\n Silkworkers                 |    2,500  |     ...   |      60  |    2,560\r\n Flax and Linen-workers      |      150  |      300  |   2,940  |    3,390\r\n Carpet-weavers              |    2,600  |      400  |    ...   |    3,000\r\n Hosiery-workers             |    6,350  |      100  |      50  |    6,500\r\n Lacemakers                  |    4,500  |     ...   |    ...   |    4,500\r\n Elastic Webworkers          |      700  |     ...   |    ...   |      700\r\n Dyers, Bleachers, and       |           |           |          |\r\n   Finishers                 |   11,820  |      180  |     100  |   12,100\r\n Overlookers                 |    4,850  |      200  |     200  |    5,250\r\n Calico-printers and         |           |           |          |\r\n   Engravers                 |    1,950  |      500  |      50  |    2,500\r\n Miscellaneous Textiles      |    7,350  |      650  |    ...   |    8,000\r\n                             | --------  |   ------  |   ------ | --------\r\n       Totals                |  184,270  |   12,330  |   3,400  |  200,000\r\n ----------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+---------\r\n\r\nThe large section of workers engaged in the manufacture of clothing\r\nand leather goods was, perhaps, the least organised of the skilled\r\ntrades. One society, indeed, the National Union of Boot and Shoe\r\nOperatives (established 1874), counted almost 43,000 members, and\r\nexercised a very real control over the machine boot trade. And\r\nalthough the hand industry was in this case rapidly declining, the\r\nAmalgamated Association of Boot and Shoemakers (established 1862)\r\nmaintained and even increased the earnings of this body of 4700 skilled\r\nhandicraftsmen. The Tailors, on the other hand, had succeeded neither\r\nin controlling the new machine industry, nor in upholding the standard\r\nearnings of the hand-workers. The Amalgamated Society of Tailors\r\n(established 1866, 17,000 members), together with the Scottish National\r\nOperative Tailors’ Society (established 1866, 4500 members), had\r\nabsorbed all the local Unions, but included only a small proportion\r\nof those at work in the trade. The Felt Hatters and Trimmers’ Union\r\n(established 1872) had 4300 members, together with a women’s branch\r\n(established 1886) numbering nearly as many. In other branches of this\r\ndivision some strong organisations existed in the smaller industries,\r\nbut the workers for the most part formed only feeble local clubs\r\nor else were totally unorganised. There were altogether over sixty\r\nseparate Unions in this division.\r\n\r\n_Table showing the approximate number of Trade Unionists in the\r\nClothing and Leather Trades._\r\n\r\n -------------------------+----------+----------+----------+--------\r\n           Trade.         |  England.|Scotland. | Ireland. |  Total.\r\n                          |and Wales.|          |          |\r\n -------------------------+----------+----------+----------+--------\r\n Boot and Shoemakers      |  46,250  |  2,250   |    500   |  49,000\r\n Other Leather Workers    |   5,900  |    550   |    100   |   6,550\r\n Tailors and other        |          |          |          |\r\n   Clothing Makers        |  16,100  |  5,500   |  2,300   |  23,900\r\n Hatmakers, Glovers, &c.  |  10,400  |    100   |     50   |  10,550\r\n                          |  ------  | ------   | ------   |  ------\r\n       Totals             |  78,650  |  8,400   |  2,950   |  90,000\r\n -------------------------+----------+----------+----------+--------\r\n\r\nThe 46,000 Trade Unionists in the paper and printing trades were\r\ndivided between four considerable Unions with 27,000 members, and\r\nforty-five little societies numbering not more than 19,000 altogether.\r\nThe compositors lead off with three extensive organisations, the London\r\nSociety of Compositors, confined to the Metropolis (established 1848,\r\n9800 members), the Typographical Association (established 1849, 11,500\r\nmembers), which had absorbed all but four of the Irish and four of\r\nthe English local societies outside the Metropolis, and the Scottish\r\nTypographical Association (established 1852, 3000 members). The\r\nBookbinders and Machine Rulers’ Consolidated Union (established 1835,\r\n3000 members), mainly composed of provincial workers, far exceeded the\r\nLondon Consolidated Bookbinders’ Society, the largest of half-a-dozen\r\nMetropolitan Unions in this trade.\r\n\r\n_Table showing the approximate number of Trade Unionists in the various\r\nbranches of the Paper and Printing Trades._\r\n\r\n --------------------------+----------+-----------+----------+--------\r\n           Trade.          | England. | Scotland. | Ireland. | Total.\r\n                           |and Wales.|           |          |\r\n --------------------------+----------+-----------+----------+--------\r\n Compositors and Press and |          |           |          |\r\n   Machine Men             | 27,250   |   4,000   |   2,000  | 33,250\r\n Bookbinders               |  5,150   |     700   |     300  |  6,150\r\n Papermakers               |  3,150   |     500   |    ...   |  3,650\r\n Miscellaneous Printing    |          |           |          |\r\n   Trades                  |  2,400   |     450   |     100  |  2,950\r\n                           | ------   |  ------   |  ------  | ------\r\n       Totals              | 37,950   |   5,650   |   2,400  | 46,000\r\n --------------------------+----------+-----------+----------+--------\r\n\r\nThere remained a number of trades which it was difficult to classify.\r\nThese miscellaneous crafts furnished over 130 societies and 58,000\r\nTrade Unionists.

Out of the 120 organisations\r\nbelonging to this group the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants\r\n(established 1872), with its permanent membership of 31,000, its high\r\ncontributions, extensive friendly benefits, and large accumulated\r\nfunds, resembled in character the large national societies of the\r\nengineering and building trades. Alongside this stood the Associated\r\nSociety of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen (established 1880,\r\n7000 members). Some other Unions in this group, such as the London\r\nand Counties Labour League (established 1872, 13,000 members),\r\nand the National Agricultural Labourers’ Union (established 1872,\r\n15,000 members), had become essentially friendly societies. But the\r\npredominating type in this division was, as might have been expected,\r\nthe new Union, with low contributions, fluctuating membership,\r\nand militant trade policy. Of these the strongest and apparently\r\nthe most stable was the National Union of Gas-workers and General\r\nLabourers (established 1889), with 36,000 members on the books. Next\r\nin membership came the Dock, Wharf, and Riverside Labourers’ Union\r\n(established 1889), the Tyneside and National Labour Union (established\r\n1889), and the National Amalgamated Sailors and Firemen’s Union\r\n(established 1887), each with a membership fluctuating between 20,000\r\nand 40,000. Other prominent Unions in this division were the General\r\nRailway Workers’ Union (established 1889), the National Union of Dock\r\nLabourers (established 1889), the National Amalgamated Coalporters’\r\nUnion (established 1890), and the Navvies, Bricklayers’ Labourers, and\r\nGeneral Labourers’ Union (established 1890). The builders’ labourers\r\nand the carmen were organised in numerous local Unions, which, in some\r\ncases, such as the Mersey Quay and Railway Carters’ Union (established\r\n1887), and the Leeds Amalgamated Association of Builders’ Labourers\r\n(established 1889), were effective trade societies. The chief exponent\r\nof New Unionism among the agricultural labourers was then the Eastern\r\nCounties Labour Federation (established 1890), which had enrolled\r\n17,000 members in Suffolk and the neighbouring counties. But any\r\nstatistical estimate of the ill-defined and constantly fluctuating\r\nmembership of the Unions in this division must necessarily be of less\r\nvalue than in the more definitely organised trades.[591]\r\n\r\n_Table showing the approximate number of Trade Unionists among the\r\nLabourers and Transport Workers of every kind._\r\n\r\n ---------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n           Trade.           |  England. | Scotland. | Ireland. |   Total.\r\n                            | and Wales.|           |          |\r\n ---------------------------+-----------+-----------+----------+----------\r\n Seamen, Fishermen,         |           |           |          \\\r\n   Watermen, &c.            |   33,850  |    3,900  |   1,500  |   39,250\r\n Railway Traffic Workers    |   43,500  |    1,500  |   3,000  |   48,000\r\n Enginemen, &c.

The same might be said of the Boilermakers’ Society in\r\nall the iron shipbuilding ports, though not in some of the Midland\r\ndistricts. And to turn to an even larger industry, 80 per cent of the\r\ncoalminers were in union, some districts, such as Northumberland and\r\nparts of the West Riding of Yorkshire, having practically every hewer\r\nin the society. And in other industries and localities the Union was\r\nsometimes equally inclusive. Among the Dublin Coopers or the Midland\r\nFlint Glass Makers, the Nottingham Lacemakers or the Yorkshire Glass\r\nBottle Makers, non-Unionism was practically unknown. We see, therefore,\r\nthat instead of numbering only 4 per cent of the total population, the\r\nTrade Union world was in certain districts and in certain industries,\r\nalready in 1892 practically co-extensive with the manual labour class.\r\nOn the other hand, there were many occupations in which Trade Unionism\r\nwas non-existent. Whole classes of manual workers were practically\r\nexcluded from the Trade Union ranks by the fact that they were not\r\nhired workers at wages. In the nooks and crannies of our industrial\r\nsystem were to be found countless manual workers who obtained a\r\nprecarious livelihood by direct service of the consumer. Every town\r\nand village had its quota of hawkers, costermongers, tallymen, and\r\nother petty dealers; of cobblers, tinkers, knifegrinders, glaziers,\r\nchairmenders, plumbers, and other jobbing craftsmen; of cab-runners,\r\n“corner boys,” men who “hang about the bridges,” and all the\r\ninnumerable parasites of the life of a great city. When we passed from\r\nthese “independent producers” to the trades in which the small master\r\nsurvived, or in which home work prevailed, we saw another region almost\r\nbarren of Trade Unionism. The tailors and cabinetmakers, for instance,\r\nthough often highly-skilled craftsmen, had only a small minority of\r\ntheir trades in Union, whilst the chain and nailmakers were almost\r\nunorganised. The effect upon Trade Unionism of a backward type of\r\nindustrial organisation was well seen in the manufacture of boots and\r\nshoes. In Leicestershire and Stafford, where the work was done in large\r\nfactories, practically every workman was in the Union. In the Midland\r\nvillages, where this was carried on as a domestic industry, and in\r\nEast London, where it was only passing out of that phase, the National\r\nSociety of Boot and Shoe Operatives counted but a small proportion of\r\nmembers. And in those districts in which the small master system still\r\nheld its own it cast a blight even on other trades. Thus the Birmingham\r\ndistrict and East London were bad Trade Union centres, not only for the\r\nsweated trades, but also for those carried on in large establishments.\r\nBut the great bulk of non-Unionism was to be found in another field.\r\nThe great army of labourers, as distinguished from mechanics, miners,\r\nor factory operatives, were in normal times as unorganised as the women\r\nworkers. Except in certain counties, such as Kent, Suffolk, Norfolk,\r\nOxfordshire, Wiltshire, and the Fen districts, Trade Unionism among the\r\nfarm labourers could scarcely be said to exist. Of the three-quarters\r\nof a million of agricultural labourers in the United Kingdom, not more\r\nthan 40,000 were then in union. Nor were the other classes of labour\r\nin much better plight. The two hundred thousand workers in the traffic\r\ndepartment of the railways contributed only 48,000 Trade Unionists,\r\nmostly from such grades as guards and engine-drivers. The large class\r\nof tramway and omnibus workers had, after a brief rally, reverted to\r\na state of disorganisation. The great army of warehousemen, porters,\r\nand other kinds of city labourers counted only a few hundred Trade\r\nUnionists in all the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Union world was, therefore, in 1892, in the main composed\r\nof skilled craftsmen working in densely populated districts, where\r\nindustry was conducted on a large scale. About one-half of the members\r\nbelonged to the three staple trades of coalmining, cotton manufacture,\r\nand engineering, whilst the labourers and the women workers were, at\r\nthis date, on the whole, non-Unionists.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of Trade Unionism on working-class life cannot be\r\nmeasured by the numbers actually contributing to the Union funds at\r\nany one time. Among the non-Unionists in the skilled trades a large\r\nproportion have at one time or another belonged to their societies.\r\nThough they have let their membership lapse for one reason or another,\r\nthey follow the lead of the Union, and are mostly ready, on the\r\nslightest encouragement from its members, or improvement in their own\r\nposition, to rejoin an organisation to which in spirit they still\r\nbelong. In the Labour Unions the instability of employment and the\r\nconstant shifting of residence caused the organisation, in 1892, to\r\nresemble a sieve, through which a perpetual stream of members was\r\nflowing, a small proportion only remaining attached for any length of\r\ntime. These lapsed members constitute in some sense a volunteer force\r\nof Trade Unionism ready to fight side by side with their old comrades,\r\nprovided that means can be found for their support. Moreover, the Trade\r\nUnionists not only belong to the most highly-skilled and best-paid\r\nindustries, but they include, as a general rule, the picked men in each\r\ntrade. The moral and intellectual influence which they exercise on\r\nthe rest of their class is, therefore, out of all proportion to their\r\nnumbers. In their ranks are found, in almost every industrial centre,\r\nall the prominent leaders of working-class opinion. They supply the\r\ndirectors of the co-operative stores, the administrators of clubs and\r\nfriendly societies, and the working-class representatives on Parish,\r\nDistrict, and Town Councils. Finally we may observe that the small\r\nbut rapidly increasing class of working-men politicians invariably\r\nconsists of men who are members of a trade society. We may safely\r\nassert that, even in 1892, no one but a staunch Trade Unionist would\r\nhave had any chance of being returned as a working-class member to the\r\nHouse of Commons, or elected to a local governing body as a Labour\r\nrepresentative.\r\n\r\nIt is therefore impossible by a statistical survey to give any adequate\r\nidea of the Trade Union world of 1892. We may note the fact that the\r\nthousand separate unions or branches between Blyth and Middlesborough\r\nnumbered some 200,000 members. We may ascertain that within fifteen\r\nmiles of the Manchester Exchange at least as many Trade Unionists lived\r\nand worked. But no figures can convey any real impression of the place\r\nwhich the Trade Union, even then, filled in the every-day life of the\r\nskilled artisans of the United Kingdom. We are therefore fortunate in\r\nbeing able to supplement our statistics by a graphic description of\r\nTrade Union life supplied to us in 1893 by a skilled craftsman, who\r\njoined his Union on the expiration of his apprenticeship, and served\r\nfor some time in various official capacities.\r\n\r\n To an apprentice, Trade Unionism is little more than a name.\r\n He may occasionally overhear the men in his shop discussing\r\n their Union and its work; and he knows that after “club\r\n night” a number of stories of the incidents of the meeting\r\n will be related; whilst, if he works in a strong Society\r\n shop, he may even hear heated discussions on resolutions\r\n submitted to the meeting. But the chief topic will always\r\n be the personal one--who was at the meeting, and what old\r\n chums were met; for the “club” is generally the recognised\r\n meeting-place for “old cronies” in the trade. If he works\r\n in a shop where any of the Trade Union officials are also\r\n employed he may sometimes receive a word of advice and\r\n exhortation “to be sure to join the Society when he is a\r\n man.” On the whole, however, his knowledge of, and interest\r\n in, the Society will be very slight. But should a strike\r\n occur at his shop whilst he is yet a lad, the presence and\r\n power of the Trade Union will be brought very vividly home\r\n to him; and as he works by himself or with the other lads\r\n in an otherwise deserted shop he will form some opinions of\r\n his own. He will naturally feel a violent antipathy to the\r\n “Blacks” brought into his shop, for the sense of comradeship\r\n is strong among boys; and he will notice with considerable\r\n pleasure that they are usually inferior workmen. But in\r\n spite of this, if the employer is “a good sort,” who treats\r\n him well and kindly, he will probably still think that the\r\n men are wrong to strike. For the boy regards the employer as\r\n the one “who finds work for the men to do,” and hence looks\r\n upon a strike as an act of ingratitude; and further, he has\r\n also a vague idea that the men are in the position of being\r\n many to one, and hence he promptly sides with the weaker\r\n party.\r\n\r\n As the youth draws near the end of his apprenticeship he\r\n finds that he is frequently spoken to by Union men and urged\r\n to join the Society. He notices, too, that more attention\r\n is paid to him, and that his opinions are frequently asked\r\n upon trade matters. Finally he is invited round to the\r\n little public in which the club meetings are held, and\r\n introduced to the Lodge officials, and to a number of his\r\n fellow-tradesmen. The advantages offered by the Society\r\n are freely dilated upon, great stress being laid upon the\r\n friendly benefits--the sick, superannuation, funeral, and,\r\n above all, the out-of-work pay. For the Trade Society is\r\n the only institution which provides an out-of-work benefit.\r\n Against sickness and death he may already be insured in\r\n one or other of the numerous Friendly Societies; but the\r\n out-of-work pay is never provided except by a Trade Society,\r\n since only there is it possible to know whether a claimant\r\n is out of work by reason of bad trade, or bad character,\r\n or inefficiency, or even if he is really out of work at\r\n all. And as the advantages of this provision are pointed\r\n out to him he recollects the time when his father, a staid,\r\n steady-going mechanic, was thrown out of work by slack\r\n times; and the memory of that bitter experience clings very\r\n closely to him. Perhaps he is also in love. The thought of\r\n seeing “her” miserable and their children hungry whilst\r\n he himself is helpless to assist, must always be one of\r\n the most harrowing things to a careful young artisan, with\r\n visions of a happy little home in the near future. There\r\n is, however, another view of the club which appeals with\r\n almost equal force to our young artisan just out of his\r\n apprenticeship and finding himself in possession of an\r\n income nearly double that to which he has been accustomed.\r\n The Trade Union Meeting House is the recognised club for the\r\n men in the craft, and thus presents many social attractions.\r\n Friendships are made--numerous “sing-songs” and smoking\r\n concerts arranged; and the joke and friendly glass, the good\r\n cheer and the conviviality, all present great attractions to\r\n the young workman.\r\n\r\n The club is also a centre for obtaining the latest trade\r\n news. Here come the unemployed from other towns; here are\r\n to be heard reports of reductions or advance of wages,\r\n increased or diminished working hours, stories of tyranny,\r\n or the first rumours of that bug-bear to the men--the\r\n invention of new machines, with its probable displacement of\r\n their labour; or even worse, the introduction of women and\r\n boys at reduced prices. There is also an occasional visit\r\n from an important official of the central office to look\r\n forward to, and his words to digest afterwards. All these\r\n attractions incline the young artisan to enrol himself in\r\n the Lodge, but it is mainly personal considerations which\r\n in the end decide him to take the step. Are the good men in\r\n his trade--those whom he likes; who have treated him well,\r\n helped him out of his difficulties and given him coppers\r\n when a lad; the powerful men, the foremen, and those whose\r\n words carry most weight with their fellows--are these men\r\n members of the Union? If they are, and if, as is most\r\n probable in a Society shop, he has formed friendships with\r\n other young fellows who are already members, it is not long\r\n before he consents, and allows himself to be duly proposed\r\n as a candidate for membership.\r\n\r\n The next club night sees him at the door of the club-room\r\n waiting anxiously, and perhaps timorously, whilst the\r\n formalities go on inside. Usually the ordinary business of\r\n the evening is all disposed of before the election of new\r\n members takes place. At the first mention by the President\r\n of the fact that a candidate is waiting to be elected, the\r\n doorkeeper (hitherto posted inside the door to see that no\r\n one comes in or goes out surreptitiously, and that none of\r\n the “worthy brothers” are in an unfit state to enter the\r\n room) slips rapidly outside, and holding the door firmly,\r\n refuses admission to any one while the ceremony lasts. The\r\n President then rising, calls for order, and having read out\r\n the name of the candidate and those of his proposer and\r\n seconder, asks those members to tell the Lodge what they\r\n know about him. Then the proposer rises, and addressing “Mr.\r\n President and worthy brothers,” states what he knows--that\r\n the candidate is a young man, apprenticed in his shop and\r\n duly served his time--a good workman and a steady young\r\n fellow--anxious to join the Society and sure to be a credit\r\n to the Lodge. He resumes his seat amid applause; and the\r\n seconder rises and repeats the same eulogy. Then the\r\n candidate is called into the room, the doorkeeper admitting\r\n him with some ceremony. He enters in fear and trembling;\r\n for the formality of admission, though shorn of its former\r\n mysterious rites, is still conducted with sufficient\r\n solemnity to make it loom as something rather terrible. At\r\n once he finds himself the object of the friendly curiosity\r\n of the members, and the cause of applause, all of which adds\r\n considerably to his nervousness and trepidation. But he is\r\n agreeably surprised to find the ceremony a very meagre one.\r\n The President, rising, calls upon all the members to do\r\n likewise, and then, all standing, he reads out an initiatory\r\n address, and a portion of the Rules of the Society. Then in\r\n a simple affirmation the candidate pledges himself to abide\r\n by the Rules, to study the interests of the Society, and\r\n neither to do, nor, if he can prevent it, allow to be done,\r\n anything in opposition thereto. He has then to formally\r\n sign this pledge. That being done, his name is entered as a\r\n member, and upon paying his entrance fee, he is presented\r\n with a card of membership and a book of Rules of the Society.\r\n\r\n He is now an ordinary member of the Lodge, and this newly\r\n acquired dignity is fully brought home to him in the course\r\n of a week or so, when he receives his first summons to\r\n attend a Lodge meeting. He wends his way to the little\r\n public-house in the dirty back street where the Lodge is\r\n held, and arriving shortly before eight o’clock, the time\r\n fixed for the opening of business, finds a number of his\r\n fellow-workmen congregated round the bar discussing the\r\n evening’s programme and trade matters generally. The men\r\n come in by twos and threes, and he notices that, with few\r\n exceptions, all are neat and clean, having been home and\r\n had their tea and a wash in the interval between then and\r\n working hours.[593] The officers of the Lodge arriving, are\r\n greeted with a general recognition as they pass upstairs\r\n to prepare the club-room for the business of the evening.\r\n Shortly after the hour fixed for commencing, the President\r\n takes the chair, and, as the men slowly straggle up into the\r\n room, rises and declares the meeting open for business. The\r\n club-room is a long, low-ceilinged room which constitutes\r\n the first floor of the public-house. Down the centre of\r\n the room runs a trestle table with forms along the sides,\r\n on which the members are seating themselves. At the top\r\n a shorter table is placed crosswise, forming a letter\r\n T, and here sits the group of officers. The room is\r\n decorated with the framed “emblems” of various trade\r\n societies, interspersed with gilt mirrors and advertising\r\n almanacs. At one end is a throne and canopy, showing that it\r\n is used also as a club-room by one or other of the friendly\r\n societies which still maintain the curious old rites of\r\n their orders. In a corner stands a cottage pianoforte,\r\n indicating that the room is also used for concerts,\r\n sing-songs, and convivial gatherings.\r\n\r\n The first business of the evening is the payment of\r\n contributions. The Secretary, aided by the “Check\r\n Secretary,” the Money Steward, and Treasurer, receives\r\n the subscriptions from the men as they come, one by one,\r\n up the room, enters the payment in the books, and signs\r\n the members’ cards. In many cases women and children come\r\n to pay the subscriptions of their husbands or fathers; and\r\n he will feel a sense of shame at the idea of these having\r\n to come through the public bar to perform their errand.\r\n When the subscriptions are all received, the unemployed\r\n members, and the wives or other relatives of those who are\r\n sick, present themselves to draw their respective benefits.\r\n General inquiries are made after the health and hopes are\r\n expressed for the speedy recovery of the sick ones; and the\r\n sums due are paid out by the officials with considerable\r\n formality. During these proceedings there has been a\r\n constant hum of conversation in the room, and a continual\r\n running in and out of members to the bar, and back again.\r\n But all this now comes to an end. The President rises and\r\n calls for order. Strangers and non-members are cleared out\r\n of the room. The doorkeeper takes up his position inside\r\n the door to watch the comers-in and goers-out; and the\r\n drink-stewards make ready to attend to the members’ wants,\r\n and act as waiters, in order to dispense with strangers\r\n in the room, and to prevent any unnecessary bustle and\r\n confusion.[594] The business of the evening opens with\r\n the reading of the minutes of the last meeting. Questions\r\n concerning the enforcement of some resolution, or the result\r\n of some instructions given to the officers, are asked\r\n and answered, and the minutes are confirmed by a show of\r\n hands and signed by the President. Then letters received,\r\n and copies of those despatched by the Secretary since the\r\n last meeting are read. These include letters from the\r\n General Office interpreting some rule as to the payment of\r\n benefits, from the District Committee giving notice of a\r\n trade regulation, and from other branch secretaries asking\r\n for particulars as to the character and ability of some\r\n candidate for admission. Then follows the excitement of the\r\n evening--the report of delegates appointed to interview\r\n an employer on some grievance. They will explain how they\r\n waited on Mr. So-and-so, who at first refused to see them,\r\n and ordered them off his premises; how presently he came\r\n round and listened to their complaints; how he denied the\r\n existence of the alleged evil, and demanded the names of\r\n the men who complained, which the delegates of course\r\n refused to give; and how at last, after much dispute, he\r\n temporised, and gave them to understand that the grievance\r\n would be remedied. Then the members present from the shop\r\n in question are called upon to explain what improvements, if\r\n any, have been made in the matters of which they complained.\r\n If their report is satisfactory, the subject is allowed to\r\n drop. If not, there is a heated discussion. Our friend,\r\n seated with the young fellows at the back of the room, finds\r\n himself clamouring for a strike. The officers do their best\r\n to hold the meeting back. They suggest that the District\r\n Committee[595] ought first to be communicated with; or if\r\n the grievance is one against which the General Rules or\r\n District Bye-laws permit the men to strike without superior\r\n sanction, they urge further negotiations with the employer.\r\n The discussion is eventually closed by an order to the\r\n Secretary to write to the District Committee for advice, or\r\n by an instruction to the delegates to again interview the\r\n offending employer, and if he “bamboozles” them a second\r\n time, to strike the shop.\r\n\r\n This excitement over, the interest of the meeting flags,\r\n and members drop out one by one. Perhaps there is an appeal\r\n by a member to whom the Committee has refused some benefit\r\n to which he thinks himself entitled. Against this decision\r\n he appeals to his fellow-members in Lodge assembled, urging\r\n his long membership, his wife and family, and his work\r\n for the Union as reasons why he should be leniently dealt\r\n with. Eloquent speeches are made on his behalf by personal\r\n friends. But the Committee and the officers declare that\r\n they have acted according to the Rules, and remind the\r\n Lodge that if they are ordered to pay an illegal benefit,\r\n the Central Office will disallow the amount, and order\r\n the members to repay it to the Union funds. With a strong\r\n Committee the vote will be against the man; with a weak one,\r\n and especially if the man is a jovial and “free-and-easy”\r\n comrade, his friends will turn up in sufficient numbers\r\n to carry the appeal. It being now ten o’clock, all other\r\n business--such as resolutions proposed by individual\r\n members--gets adjourned to the next club night, and the\r\n President declares the Lodge duly closed. The Secretary\r\n hastens home, to sit up burning midnight oil in balancing\r\n the books, entering the minutes, making reports to the\r\n Central Executive or District Committee, and writing the\r\n letters ordered by the meeting.\r\n\r\n The Lodge meeting soon plays an important part in the life\r\n of our active-minded artisan. He feels that he is taking\r\n part in the actual government of a national institution.\r\n Special meetings are held to discuss and vote on questions\r\n submitted by the Executive to the whole body of the members,\r\n such as the alteration of a rule, the election of some\r\n central official, or a grant in aid of another trade. But\r\n primarily the Lodge is his Court of Appeal against all\r\n industrial tyranny, a court in which he is certain of a\r\n ready and sympathetic hearing. There he takes complaints of\r\n fines and deductions, of arbitrary foremen, of low piecework\r\n prices--of anything, in short, which affects his interest or\r\n comfort as a wage-earner.\r\n\r\n The tendency of this ever-present power and actuality of\r\n the Lodge and its officials is to overshadow in the mind\r\n of the member the larger functions and responsibilities\r\n of the Central Executive. To him they are something far\r\n away in the vast outside world, and their powers are very\r\n vague and shadowy. They are, however, brought home to him\r\n in some of the incidents of his Trade Union and working\r\n life. There is, for instance, the “emblem” of his Society,\r\n a large and generally highly-coloured representation of the\r\n various processes of the trade in which he is engaged, often\r\n excellently designed and executed. This, purchased for a\r\n few shillings soon after his admission to the Society, or\r\n more probably at the time of his marriage, is hung, gaily\r\n framed, in his front parlour. On it is recorded his name,\r\n age, and date of admission to the Society, and it bears\r\n the signatures, and perhaps the portraits, of the general\r\n officers. To him it is some slight connecting link with the\r\n other men in his trade and Society. To his wife it is the\r\n charter of their rights in case of sickness, want of work,\r\n or death. As such it is an object of pride in the household,\r\n pointed out with due impressiveness to friends and casual\r\n visitors.\r\n\r\n But more important is the Monthly Circular, now a recognised\r\n feature in most of the large Unions. Here the member feels\r\n himself brought into direct contact with the outside world\r\n of his trade. Has he been ill or out of work and drawn\r\n relief, his name and the amount of money drawn are duly\r\n recorded. If he has not himself been so unfortunate, he\r\n here learns the names of those who have, and perhaps hears\r\n from this source for the first time of such a calamity\r\n having befallen some friend in another and distant town.\r\n Here also are reports of the state of trade and the number\r\n of unemployed in every place where a branch of the Society\r\n exists; of alterations in hours and rates of wages effected\r\n during the month, by friendly negotiations or by a lock-out\r\n or a strike. Finally, there are letters from lodges or\r\n from individual members on all sorts of topics, including\r\n spicy abuse of the Central Executive, and tart rejoinders\r\n from the General Secretary. As his interest in the Society\r\n increases, our artisan himself writes letters to the\r\n Circular, explaining some grievance, suggesting a remedy for\r\n some grievance already explained, or answering criticisms\r\n upon the conduct and policy of his District Committee or his\r\n Lodge.\r\n\r\n In addition to the Monthly Circular there is the Annual\r\n Report. This is a large volume of some hundreds of pages,\r\n containing, in a summarised form, the progress and doings of\r\n the Society for the whole year, with the total income and\r\n expenditure and the balance in hand, the proportionate cost\r\n of all the various benefits, a statement of the accounts\r\n of each branch, and many other figures of interest and\r\n importance. He feels a glow of pride as the growth of his\r\n Society in funds and members is recorded, and perhaps also a\r\n longing to see his own name printed as one of the officers\r\n of one of the Lodges, and thus be even distantly associated\r\n with the success of the Society.\r\n\r\n But after a year or two of the comparative freedom of\r\n the journeyman’s life he begins to feel strongly the\r\n desire for change and adventure. The five or seven years’\r\n apprenticeship through which he has just passed has kept\r\n him chained in one place, and a period of unrest now\r\n begins. Moreover, he has heard as a commonplace among his\r\n fellow-workmen, that no man knows his own ability or what\r\n he is worth until he has worked in more towns or shops than\r\n one. They have also expatiated to him upon the delights of\r\n “the road”; and finally he determines to take advantage of\r\n his membership of the Society to go on tramp on the first\r\n opportunity. He is therefore not altogether displeased when\r\n some temporary contraction in his trade causes his employer\r\n to turn him adrift, and thus gives him a right to draw his\r\n travelling card.[596]\r\n\r\n At the close of his first day’s tramp, footsore and weary,\r\n he seeks the public-house at which the local Lodge is\r\n held, and having refreshed himself, starts off to find the\r\n Secretary. To him he presents his tramp card. When, on\r\n examination, the dates upon it are found to be correct,\r\n and the distance traversed is sufficient to entitle the\r\n traveller to the full benefit of sixpence and a bed, the\r\n Secretary writes an order to the publican to provide this\r\n relief. The date and place are then clearly marked on the\r\n travelling card, and the Secretary retains the corresponding\r\n half of the receipt form to serve as his own voucher for the\r\n expenditure. Should he know of any suitable situation vacant\r\n in the town, he will tell the tramp to repair there in the\r\n morning. But if no such post offers itself, the wayfarer\r\n must start off again in the morning, in time to arrive\r\n before night at the next Lodge town, at which alone he can\r\n receive any further relief.\r\n\r\n If our friend takes to the road during the summer months\r\n and finds a situation within a few weeks, he will have had\r\n nothing worse than a pleasant holiday excursion. But if his\r\n tramp falls during the winter, or if he has to remain for\r\n months on the move, he will be in a pitiable plight. Whilst\r\n he is in the thickly-populated industrial districts, where\r\n “relief towns” in his trade are frequently to be met with,\r\n he finds his supper and bed at the end of every fifteen or\r\n twenty miles. But as he one by one exhausts these towns,\r\n he will, by the rule forbidding relief from the same Lodge\r\n at less than three months’ interval, be compelled to go\r\n further afield. He presently finds the Lodges so far apart\r\n that it is impossible for a man to walk from one to another\r\n in a day. The relief afforded becomes inadequate for his\r\n maintenance, and many are the shifts to which he has to\r\n resort for food and shelter. Finally, after a specified\r\n period, usually three months, his card “runs out”; he has\r\n become “box-fast,” and can draw no more from the Society\r\n until he has found a job, and resumed payment of his\r\n contributions.\r\n\r\n But our artisan, being an able-bodied young craftsman, has\r\n found a job. Settled in a new town, his tramping for the\r\n present at an end, and himself recovered from the evils,\r\n moral and physical, which that brief period has wrought upon\r\n him, his interest in his Society revives. He attends his new\r\n Lodge regularly, at first because it is the only place in\r\n the town where he meets friends. Presently his old desire\r\n to figure as an official of the Society returns to him. He\r\n cultivates the acquaintance of the officers of the Lodge,\r\n mixes freely with the members, and takes every occasion to\r\n speak on exciting questions. At the next election he is\r\n appointed to some minor post, such as auditor or steward. He\r\n makes himself useful and popular, and in the course of the\r\n year finds himself a member of the Lodge Committee.\r\n\r\n From membership of the Branch Committee he succeeds to\r\n the position of Branch Secretary, the highest to which his\r\n fellow-tradesmen in his own town can elect him. On the night\r\n of the election he is somewhat surprised to find that there\r\n is no keen competition for the post. The pay of a Branch\r\n Secretary is meagre enough--from ten to fifty shillings per\r\n quarter. Most of his evenings and part of his Sundays are\r\n taken up with responsible clerical work. Besides attending\r\n the fortnightly or weekly committee meeting, lasting from\r\n eight to eleven or twelve at night, he has to prepare the\r\n agenda for the special and general meetings of the members,\r\n conduct the whole correspondence of the Lodge, draw up\r\n reports for the District Committee and Central Executive,\r\n keep the accounts, and prepare elaborate balance-sheets\r\n for the head office. Even his working day is not free from\r\n official duties. At any moment he may be called out of his\r\n shop to sign the card of a tramp, or he may have to hurry\r\n away in the dinner-hour to prevent members striking a shop\r\n without the sanction of the Lodge. When a deputation is\r\n appointed to wait on an employer, he must ask for a day\r\n off, and act as leading spokesman for the men. All this\r\n involves constant danger of dismissal from his work, or\r\n even boycott by the employers, as an “agitator.” Nor will\r\n he always be thanked for his pains. Before he was elected\r\n to the Secretaryship, he was probably “hail, fellow, well\r\n met” with all the other members. Now he has constantly to\r\n thwart the wishes and interests of individual members. He\r\n must be always advising the Committee to refuse benefits to\r\n members whose cases fall outside the Rules of the Society,\r\n and counselling Lodge meetings to refuse to sanction\r\n strikes. Hence he soon finds little cliques formed among\r\n the malcontents, who bitterly oppose him. He is charged\r\n with injustice, pusillanimity, treachery, and finally with\r\n being a “master’s man.” But after a while, if he holds\r\n steadfastly on his course, and abides strictly to the Rules\r\n of the Society, he finds himself backed up by the Executive\r\n Committee, and gaining the confidence of the shrewd and\r\n sensible workmen who constitute the bulk of the members, and\r\n who can always be called up to support the officers in Lodge\r\n meetings.\r\n\r\n One of the duties or privileges thrust on our Secretary is\r\n that of representing his trade on the local Trades Council.\r\n He is not altogether gratified to find that the Branch has\r\n elected, as his co-delegates, some of the more talkative\r\n and less level-headed of its members. Some older and more\r\n experienced men decline to serve, on the ground that they\r\n have no time, and “have seen enough of that sort of thing.”\r\n Nevertheless our Secretary at the outset takes his position\r\n very seriously. To the young Trade Unionist the Trades\r\n Council represents the larger world of labour politics, and\r\n he has visions of working for the election of labour men on\r\n the local governing bodies, and of being himself run by the\r\n Trades Council for the School Board, or the Town Council, or\r\n perhaps even for Parliament itself. When the monthly meeting\r\n of the Council comes round, he therefore makes a point of\r\n arriving punctually at eight o’clock at the Council Chamber.\r\n He finds himself in the large and gaudily decorated assembly\r\n room, over the bar of one of the principal public-houses of\r\n the town. A low platform is erected at one end, with chairs\r\n and a small table for the Chairman and Secretary. Below\r\n the platform is placed a long table at which are seated\r\n the reporters of the local newspapers, and the rest of the\r\n room is filled with chairs and improvised benches for the\r\n delegates. Here he meets the thirty or sixty delegates of\r\n the other Unions. He notices with regret that the salaried\r\n officials of the Societies which have their headquarters in\r\n the town, and the District Delegates of the great national\r\n Unions who are located in the neighbourhood--the very men\r\n he hoped to meet in this local “Parliament of Labour”--are\r\n conspicuous by their absence. The bulk of the delegates are\r\n either branch officials like himself, or representatives of\r\n the rank and file of Trade Unionism like his colleagues.\r\n The meeting opens quietly with much reading of minutes\r\n and correspondence by the Secretary. Then come the trade\r\n reports, delegate after delegate rising to protest against\r\n some encroachment by an employer, or to report the result\r\n of some negotiations for the removal of a grievance. A few\r\n questions may perhaps be asked by the other delegates,\r\n but there is usually no attempt to go into the merits of\r\n the case, the Council contenting itself with giving a\r\n sympathetic hearing, and applauding any general denunciation\r\n of industrial tyranny. If a strike is in progress, the\r\n delegates of the trade concerned ask for “credentials”\r\n (a letter by the Secretary of the Council commending the\r\n strikers to the assistance of other trades), and even appeal\r\n for financial assistance from the Council itself. This\r\n brings about difference of opinion. The whole Council has\r\n applauded the strike, but when it comes to the question of\r\n a levy, the representatives of such old-established Unions\r\n as the Compositors, Engineers, Masons, and Bricklayers get\r\n up and explain that the Rules of their Societies do not\r\n allow them to pledge themselves. On the other hand, the\r\n enthusiastic delegates from a newly-formed Labour Union\r\n promptly promise the assistance of their Society, and\r\n vehemently accuse the Council of apathy. Then follows a\r\n still more serious business--a complaint by one of the\r\n several Unions in the engineering or building trades that\r\n the members of a rival Union have lately “black-legged”\r\n their dispute. The delegates from the aggrieved Society\r\n excitedly explain how their men had been withdrawn from a\r\n certain firm which refused to pay the Standard Rate, and\r\n how, almost immediately afterwards, the members of the\r\n other Society had accepted the employer’s terms and got\r\n the work. Then the delegates from the accused Society with\r\n equal warmth assert that the work in question belonged\r\n properly to their branch of the trade; that the members of\r\n the other Society had no business to be doing it at all;\r\n and that as the employers offered the rates specified in\r\n their working rules, they were justified in accepting the\r\n job. At once an angry debate ensues, in which personal\r\n charges and technical details are bandied from side to side,\r\n to the utter bewilderment of the rest of the members. In\r\n vain the Chairman intervenes, and appeals for order. At\r\n last the Council, tired of the wrangle, rids itself of the\r\n question by referring it to a Committee, and an old member\r\n of the Council whispers to our friend a fervent hope that\r\n the Committee will shirk its job, and never meet, since its\r\n report would please neither party, and probably lead to the\r\n retirement of one if not both trades from the Council.\r\n\r\n The next business brings the Council back to harmony. The\r\n delegates appointed at the last meeting to urge on the\r\n Town Council or the School Board the adoption of a “fair\r\n wage clause” now give in their report. They describe how\r\n Mr. Alderman Jones, a local politician of the old school,\r\n talked about wanton extravagance and the woes of the poor\r\n ratepayer; and the Council will be moved to laughter at\r\n their rejoinder, “How about the recent increase in the\r\n salary of your friend, the Town Clerk?” They repeat, with\r\n pleasure, the arguments they used on the deputation, and\r\n their final shot, a bold statement as to the number of\r\n Trade Unionists on the electoral register, is received with\r\n general applause. But in spite of all this they report that\r\n Alderman Jones has prevailed, and the Town Council has\r\n rejected the clause. Our new member notes with satisfaction\r\n that the Council is not so ineffective a body as he has been\r\n fearing. After a good deal of excited talk the Secretary is\r\n instructed to write to the local newspapers explaining the\r\n position, and calling attention to the example set by other\r\n leading municipalities. The members, new and old alike,\r\n undertake to heckle the retiring Town Councillors who voted\r\n against the interests of labour; and the best men of the\r\n Council, to whichever political party they belong, join in\r\n voting for a Committee to run Trade Union candidates against\r\n their most obdurate opponents.\r\n\r\n Passing, rejecting, or adjourning resolutions, of which\r\n notice has been given at a previous meeting, takes up the\r\n remainder of the evening. First come propositions submitted\r\n on behalf of the Executive Committee, composed of five or\r\n seven of the leading men in the Council. The Secretary\r\n explains that an influential member of the Trade Union\r\n Congress Parliamentary Committee has intimated that if they\r\n want a certain measure passed into law, they had better\r\n carry a particular resolution, which is thereupon read to\r\n the meeting. It is briefly discussed, carried unanimously,\r\n and handed to the reporters, the Secretary being ordered\r\n to send copies to the local M.P.’s and possibly to the\r\n Cabinet Minister concerned. Resolutions by other members are\r\n not so easily disposed of. The delegate from the Tailors,\r\n a fanatical adherent of the Peace Society, proposes a\r\n strong condemnation of increased armaments, ending up with\r\n a plea for international arbitration. But the engineer\r\n and the shipwright vehemently object to the resolution as\r\n impracticable, and one of them moves an amendment calling\r\n on the Government to find employment for hardworking\r\n mechanics in times of industrial depression by building\r\n additional ironclads. The Socialist Secretary of a Labour\r\n Union submits a resolution calling on the Town Council to\r\n open municipal workshops for the unemployed--a project\r\n which is ridiculed by the Conservative compositor (who is\r\n acting also as one of the reporters). During the debate the\r\n Chairman, Secretary, and Executive Committeemen lie low and\r\n say nothing, allowing the discussion to wander away from\r\n the point. The debate drops, and if a vote on a popular\r\n but impracticable resolution becomes imminent, some “old\r\n Parliamentary hand” suggests its adjournment to a fuller\r\n meeting. For the next few evenings our friend finds all this\r\n instructive and interesting enough. Before the year is up\r\n he has realised that, except on such simple issues as the\r\n Fair Wages Clause, and the payment of Trade Union wages by\r\n the local authorities, the crowded meeting of tired workmen,\r\n unused to official business, with knowledge and interest\r\n strictly limited to a single industry, is useless as a\r\n Court of Appeal, and ineffective even as a joint committee\r\n of the local trades. At the best the Council becomes the\r\n instrument, or, so to speak, the sounding-board, of the\r\n experienced members, who are in touch with the Trade Union\r\n Parliamentary leaders, and who (at a pay of only a few\r\n shillings a quarter) conduct all the correspondence and\r\n undertake all the business which the Trade Unions of the\r\n town have really in common.\r\n\r\n But our friend receives a sudden check in his career. One\r\n pay-day he is told by his employer that he will not be\r\n wanted after next week. It may be that he has had some\r\n words with the foreman over a spoilt job, or that he has\r\n been making himself too prominent in Trade Union work, or\r\n simply that his employer’s business is slack. But whatever\r\n the cause he is discharged, and must seek employment\r\n elsewhere. At once he declares himself on the funds of the\r\n Society, sending notice to the President and Treasurer of\r\n his position and signing the out-of-work book at the club\r\n daily, like any other unemployed member. For the next two\r\n or three weeks he tramps from shop to shop in his district\r\n seeking work, and eagerly scans the daily papers in hopes\r\n of finding an advertisement of some vacant situation. Then\r\n comes the news from a friend of a vacancy in a distant town.\r\n He resigns his position as Secretary of the Lodge, draws\r\n the balance of out-of-work pay due to him, and departs\r\n regretfully from the town where he has made so many friends\r\n to start upon a new situation.\r\n\r\n On arriving at his new place he is surprised to find that\r\n there is no branch of his Society in the town. There are a\r\n few odd members, but not enough to support a branch--hence\r\n they send their contributions to the nearest Lodge town.\r\n As soon as he has settled down he takes steps to alter\r\n this. In his own workshop he argues and cajoles the men\r\n into a belief in Trade Unionism. At night he frequents\r\n their favourite haunts, and by dint of argument, promises\r\n and appeals, finally gets enough of them to agree to join\r\n a Lodge to make it worth while opening one in the town. He\r\n forthwith communicates with the Central Executive Committee,\r\n and they, knowing his previous work, appoint him Secretary\r\n _pro tem._ A meeting of all the trade is then called by\r\n handbills sent round to the shops, and posted in the men’s\r\n favourite public-houses. On the eventful night the General\r\n Secretary and perhaps another Central officer, come down\r\n to the town. They bring a Branch box containing sets of\r\n Rules and cards of membership, a full set of cash and other\r\n books, a number of business papers, and even a bottle of\r\n ink--in fact all that is needful to carry on the business\r\n of a Lodge. The room will be crammed full of the men in the\r\n trade interested in hearing what the Society is and what it\r\n wants to do. Speeches are made, the advances of wages and\r\n reduction of hours gained by the Society are enumerated, the\r\n friendly benefits are explained, and instances are given\r\n of men disabled from working at their trade, receiving £100\r\n accident benefit from the Society, and setting up in a small\r\n business of their own. Then the General Secretary opens the\r\n Lodge, and entrance fees and contributions are paid by a\r\n large number of those present, and the meeting changed from\r\n a public to a private one. Officers are elected, our friend\r\n again finds himself chosen as Secretary, a friendly foreman\r\n accepts the post of Treasurer, while the other old members\r\n present at the meeting are elected to the remaining offices.\r\n Addresses from the Central officials start the Lodge on its\r\n way, and the meeting breaks up at a late hour with cheers\r\n for the Society and the General Secretary.\r\n\r\n Within the next three months the Branch Secretary finds that\r\n all that glitters is not gold. At least half of those who\r\n joined at the beginning have lapsed, and at times the branch\r\n looks like collapsing altogether. But by dint of much hard\r\n work, persuasion, and perhaps the formation of friendships,\r\n it is kept together until a time of prosperity for the\r\n trade arrives. This is the Secretary’s opportunity to make\r\n or break his Lodge, and being a wise man he takes it. He\r\n puts a resolution on the agenda paper for the next Lodge\r\n meeting in favour of an advance of wages, or a reduction of\r\n hours, or both. The next meeting carries it unanimously,\r\n and it at once becomes the talk of the whole trade in the\r\n town. Men flock down and join the club in order to assist\r\n and participate in the proposed improvements. Then the\r\n Secretary appeals to the General Executive for permission\r\n to ask for the advance. They consider the matter seriously,\r\n and want to know what proportion of the men in the town are\r\n members, and how long they have been so; what is the feeling\r\n of the non-Unionists towards the proposed movement, and\r\n whether there is any local fund to support non-Unionists\r\n who come out, or buy off tramps and strangers who come to\r\n the town during the probable strike. All these questions\r\n being more or less satisfactorily answered, permission to\r\n seek the improvement is at length given, and now comes the\r\n Secretary’s first taste of “powder” in an official capacity.\r\n\r\n During this agitation the number of members in the Lodge\r\n has been steadily increasing, until it comes to include a\r\n good proportion of the trade in the town. The non-Unionists\r\n have also been approached as to their willingness to assist\r\n the movement, and the bulk of them readily agree to come\r\n out with the Society men if these undertake to maintain\r\n them. A special Committee is formed to conduct the “Advance\r\n Movement,” including delegates from the non-Society shops\r\n prepared to strike. A local levy is put on the members of\r\n the Lodge, in order to form a fund from which to pay such\r\n strike expenses as may not be charged to the Union. At\r\n length all is ready, and our Secretary is instructed to\r\n serve notices upon all the employers in the town, asking for\r\n the advance in wages or the reduction of hours claimed by\r\n the men.\r\n\r\n Meanwhile the employers have not been idle. They have\r\n heard rumours of the coming storm and have met together\r\n and consulted as to what should be done, and have formed\r\n a more or less temporary association to meet the attack.\r\n Upon receiving the notices from the men’s Secretary they\r\n invite a deputation of the men to wait upon them and discuss\r\n the matter. To this the men of course agree, and on the\r\n appointed night the Secretary and the “Advance Committee”\r\n appear at the joint meeting. The leading employer having\r\n been elected to the chair, asks the men to open their case\r\n for an advance of wages and reduction of hours. This they\r\n do, emphasising the facts that wages are lower and hours\r\n longer here than in the same trade in neighbouring towns;\r\n that the cost of living is increasing; and that some men\r\n are always unemployed who would be absorbed by the proposed\r\n change. The employers retort by urging the smallness of\r\n their profits and the difficulty of securing orders in\r\n competition with other towns where wages are even less than\r\n they are here; and also by urging that the cost of living\r\n is decreasing and not increasing--an assertion which they\r\n support by statements of the price of various articles\r\n at different times compared with the present. The men’s\r\n Secretary has as much as he can do to keep his men in order.\r\n The new members--the “raw heads” of the Committee--are\r\n almost hoping that the employers will not agree, for to them\r\n a strike means merely a few weeks’ “play,” at the expense\r\n of the Union. And the ordinary workman is so little used\r\n to discussing with his adversaries that any statement of\r\n the other side of the case is apt to arouse temper. The\r\n employers, too, unaccustomed to treating with their men,\r\n and still feeling it somewhat derogatory to do so, are not\r\n inclined to mince matters, or smooth over difficulties.\r\n Hence the meeting becomes noisy; discussion turns into\r\n recrimination; and the conference breaks up in confusion.\r\n\r\n Meanwhile the Central Executive has watched with anxiety\r\n the approach of a dispute which will involve the Union in\r\n expense, and end possibly in defeat. The General Secretary,\r\n accompanied by one of the Executive Council, appears on the\r\n scene, and endeavours to mediate. But as the town has been\r\n a non-Union one, the employers refuse to see any but their\r\n own workmen, and thus lose the chance of the very moderate\r\n compromise which the General Secretary is almost sure to\r\n offer. This slight to their Official naturally incenses the\r\n local Unionists, and on the following Saturday, when their\r\n notices have expired, they “pick up” their tools as they\r\n leave the works and the strike is begun.\r\n\r\n Then follows a period of intense excitement and hard\r\n work for the men’s officials. The employers advertise in\r\n all directions for men at “good wages” to take “steady\r\n employment,” and counter advertisements are inserted\r\n giving notice of the strike. All the streets are closely\r\n picketed by men, who take it in turns to do duty in twos\r\n and threes outside a factory or workshop for so many hours\r\n each day; pickets are sent to meet all trains, and by dint\r\n of promises, bribes, and appeals to their “manliness and\r\n brotherhood,” workmen who have been attracted to the town by\r\n the employers’ advertisements are induced to depart. Perhaps\r\n a few “blacks” may escape their vigilance and get into some\r\n shop. Every time they come out they are followed and urged\r\n to abandon their dirty calling and join their fellows in the\r\n good work. Some give way, and their fares are at once paid\r\n to the place whence they came. Subscription boxes and sheets\r\n are sent out to raise the funds necessary for the extra\r\n expenses, which must not be taken from the Society’s funds.\r\n If the strike drags on for many weeks delegates go from\r\n town to town addressing meetings of Trade Unions and Trades\r\n Councils soliciting aid, and usually succeed in getting a\r\n good deal more than their own expenses, the surplus being\r\n remitted to the Lodge. There are the non-Unionists who have\r\n come out on strike to be supported; “blacks” to bribe and\r\n send away; printing and delivering of bills and placards to\r\n be paid for, and numerous other subsidiary expenses to be\r\n met, all of which must be defrayed from the local fund.\r\n\r\n But even the most protracted strike comes to an end. If\r\n trade is good and the men are well organised, the employers\r\n will not have succeeded in getting any good workmen, and not\r\n even sufficient bad ones, to continue their works, and their\r\n plant and reputation are alike suffering from unskilled\r\n workmanship. So one by one they give in, and accept the\r\n men’s terms, until at length the men are again at work. On\r\n the other hand, if business be slack the strike may end in\r\n another way. One by one the employers obtain enough men\r\n of one sort or another to carry out what orders they have\r\n in hand. As week succeeds week the strikers lose heart,\r\n until at last the weak ones suddenly return to work at the\r\n old terms. The officers and committeemen and a few dogged\r\n fighters may remain out, hoping against hope that something\r\n will turn up to make the employers give in. But the Central\r\n Executive will probably object to the continued drain of\r\n strike-pay, and may presently declare the strike closed.\r\n This will cause some little resentment among the local\r\n stalwarts, but the strike-pay being now at an end, those\r\n who are still unemployed must tramp off to another town in\r\n search of work.\r\n\r\n If the strike results thus in failure the newly formed\r\n Lodge will soon disappear and the men in the trade remain\r\n unorganised until the advent of another leader of energy and\r\n ability. But if it has resulted in victory the prosperity of\r\n the Lodge is assured. The workmen in the trade flock to the\r\n support of an institution which has shown such practically\r\n beneficial results. Meanwhile the Secretary, to whom most of\r\n the credit is due, begins to be known throughout the trade,\r\n and spoken of as the man who changed such and such a place\r\n from a non-Union to a Union town. Short eulogistic notices\r\n of his career appear in the Monthly Circular, and thus the\r\n way is paved for his future advancement.\r\n\r\n Having thus succeeded in organising his own trade, he finds\r\n an outlet for his energies in doing the same for others\r\n in his town. Perhaps there are other branches of his own\r\n industry without organisations, and if so he begins among\r\n them exactly the same work as he pursued among his own\r\n members. When the time is ripe a meeting is called and a\r\n branch of the society, which embraces the particular body of\r\n men, opened, and he accepts the post of President to help it\r\n along until its members have gained some experience. Then he\r\n will begin again with other trades and go through the same\r\n process, and thus in the course of time succeed in turning\r\n a very bad Trade Union town into a very good one. When that\r\n is accomplished he determines to start a Trades Council.\r\n He attends meetings of all the Unions and branches in the\r\n town and explains the objects and urges the importance of\r\n such a body. He writes letters to the local Press, and\r\n agitates among his own personal following until his object\r\n is well advertised. Finally a joint meeting of delegates\r\n from the majority of the local societies and branches is\r\n got together. The Rules of a neighbouring Trades Council\r\n are discussed and adopted, and at length a Trades Council\r\n is definitely established, if only by the two or three\r\n branches which he has himself organised. He is of course\r\n appointed its Secretary, and gradually by hard work, and\r\n perhaps by successfully agitating for some concession to\r\n labour by the Town Council or local School Board, he wins\r\n the approval of all the societies, and the Council then\r\n becomes a thoroughly representative body. As Secretary of\r\n a newly established Trades Council he becomes rapidly well\r\n known. He is in constant request as a speaker in both his\r\n own and neighbouring towns; and he is sent to the Trade\r\n Union Congress and instructed to move some resolution of\r\n his own drafting. But as the work gradually increases, our\r\n friend, who has all the time to be earning a livelihood at\r\n his trade, finds that he must choose between the Trades\r\n Council and his own Lodge. Through the Trades Council he\r\n can become an influential local politician, and may one\r\n day find himself the successful “Labour Candidate” for\r\n the School Board or the Town Council. But this activity\r\n on behalf of labour generally draws him ever further away\r\n from the routine duties of Branch Secretary of a National\r\n Society, and he will hardly fail to displease some of the\r\n members of his own trade. He may therefore prefer to resign\r\n his Secretaryship of the Trades Council, take a back seat in\r\n politics, and spend all his leisure in the work of his own\r\n Society, with the honourable ambition of eventually becoming\r\n one of its salaried officers. In this case he not only\r\n conducts the business of his Lodge with regularity, but also\r\n serves on the District Committee. Presently, as the most\r\n methodical of its members, he will be chosen to act as its\r\n Secretary, and thus be brought into close communication with\r\n the Central Executive, and with other branches and districts.\r\n\r\n All this constitutes what we may call the non-commissioned\r\n officer’s service in the Trade Union world, carried out\r\n in the leisure, and paid for by the hour, snatched from a\r\n week’s work at the bench or the forge. But now the fame\r\n of our Secretary and his steady work for the Society have\r\n spread throughout the district, and when it is decided to\r\n appoint a District Delegate with a salary of £2 or £2: 10s.\r\n per week, many branches request him to run for the post.\r\n His personal friends and supporters among them raise an\r\n election fund for him, and for a few weeks he dashes about\r\n his district and attends all the branch meetings to urge his\r\n candidature upon the members. Finally the votes are taken\r\n in the Lodges by ballot and sent to the general office to\r\n be counted, and he finds himself duly elected to the post.\r\n Again he moves his home, this time to some central town,\r\n so that he can visit any part of his district with ease\r\n and rapidity. His district stretches over three or four\r\n counties, and includes many large industrial centres, and he\r\n finds himself fully occupied. Let us see how he spends his\r\n days, and what is the work he will do for his Society.\r\n\r\n Every morning he receives a whole batch of letters on\r\n Society business. The General Secretary orders him\r\n immediately to visit one of the branches in his district and\r\n inspect the books, a report having reached the office of\r\n some irregularity. A Branch Secretary telegraphs for him to\r\n come over at once and settle a dispute which has broken out\r\n with an important firm. Another writes asking him to summon\r\n a mass meeting of the trade in the district to take a vote\r\n for or against a general strike against some real or fancied\r\n grievance. The Secretary of the Employers’ Association\r\n in another town fixes an appointment with him to discuss\r\n the piecework prices for a new sort of work. Finally the\r\n Secretary of his District Committee instructs him to attend\r\n a joint meeting which they have arranged with the District\r\n Committee of another Union to settle a difficult question of\r\n overlap or apportionment of work between the members of the\r\n two societies.\r\n\r\n Our friend spends the first half an hour at his\r\n correspondence, fixes a day for a special audit of the\r\n accounts of the suspected branch, drops a hasty line to the\r\n General Secretary informing him of his whereabouts for the\r\n next few days, and writes to the Branch Secretary strongly\r\n objecting to the proposed mass meeting to vote on a strike\r\n on the ground that “an aggregate meeting is an aggravated\r\n meeting,” and appointing, instead, a day for a small\r\n conference of representatives from the different branches.\r\n Then he is off to the railway station so as to arrive\r\n promptly on the scene of the dispute just reported to him.\r\n Here he finds that a number of his members have peremptorily\r\n struck work and are hanging about the gates of the works.\r\n He will half persuade, half order them to instantly resume\r\n work, whilst he goes into the office to seek the employer.\r\n If it is a “Society shop” in a good Trade Union district\r\n he is heartily welcomed, and the matter is settled in a\r\n few minutes. The next train takes him to the neighbouring\r\n town, where he spends two or three hours with the Employers’\r\n Secretary, using all his wits to manipulate the new prices\r\n in such a way as at least to maintain, if not to increase,\r\n the weekly earnings of his members. In the evening he has\r\n to be back at the centre of his district, thrashing out, in\r\n the long and heated debate of a joint meeting, the difficult\r\n question of whose job the work in dispute between the two\r\n Unions properly is, and what constitutes a practical line\r\n of demarcation between the two trades. Thus he rushes about\r\n from day to day, finishing up at night with writing reports\r\n on the state of trade, organisation, and other matters to\r\n the Executive Committee sitting at the headquarters of his\r\n Union.\r\n\r\n He has now been for many years the devoted servant of his\r\n fellow-workmen, re-elected at the end of each term to his\r\n post of District Delegate. Upon the removal by resignation\r\n or death of the General Secretary he is pressed on all\r\n sides to put up for the post. The members of the District\r\n Committee, and all the secretaries of the local branches,\r\n urge on him his fitness, and the advantages the district\r\n will derive from his election as General Secretary. Again\r\n a committee of his friends and supporters raises a fund\r\n to enable him to travel over the whole country and visit\r\n and address all the branches of the Society. Meanwhile the\r\n Executive Committee prepares for the election of the new\r\n General Secretary. At the removal of the late head officer\r\n they at once meet to appoint one of their number to carry\r\n on the duties _pro tem._, and to issue notices asking for\r\n nominations for the post (generally confined to members who\r\n have been in the Society a certain number of years and are\r\n not in arrears with their subscriptions). Printed lists of\r\n candidates are forthwith sent to the branches in sufficient\r\n numbers to be distributed to all the members. A ballot-box\r\n is placed in the club-room, the election standing over at\r\n least two meeting nights in order to allow every member full\r\n opportunity to record his vote. The boxes are then sent from\r\n the branches to the central office, where the members of the\r\n Executive Committee count the papers and declare the result.\r\n\r\n Our District Delegate having been declared duly elected\r\n to the post of General Secretary is again compelled to\r\n remove. This time it is to one of the great cities--London,\r\n Manchester, or Newcastle--the headquarters of his Society.\r\n He is now entitled to a salary ranging from £200 to £300 per\r\n annum, and has attained the highest office to which it is in\r\n the power of his fellow-tradesmen to appoint him. We will\r\n there leave him to enjoy the dignity and influence of the\r\n position, to struggle through the laborious routine work of\r\n a central office, and to discover the new difficulties and\r\n temptations which beset the life of the general officer of a\r\n great Trade Union.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing narrative gives us, in minute detail, the inner life of\r\nTrade Union organisation of thirty years ago. But this picture, on\r\nthe face of it, represents the career of an officer, not a private\r\nsoldier, in the Trade Union army. Nor must it be supposed that the\r\ngreat majority of the million and a half Trade Unionists rendered, even\r\nas privates, any active service in the Trade Union forces. Only in the\r\ncrisis of some great dispute do we find the branch meetings crowded,\r\nor the votes at all commensurate with the total number of members.\r\nAt other times the Trade Union appears to the bulk of its members\r\neither as a political organisation whose dictates they are ready to\r\nobey at Parliamentary and other elections, or as a mere benefit club\r\nin the management of which they do not desire to take part. In the\r\nlong intervals of peace during which the constitution of the Society\r\nis being slowly elaborated, the financial basis strengthened, the\r\npolitical and trade policy determined, less than a half or perhaps even\r\na tenth of the members will actively participate in the administrative\r\nand legislative work. Practically the whole of this minority will,\r\nat one time or another, serve on branch committees or in such minor\r\noffices as steward, trustee, auditor or sick-visitor. These are the\r\nmembers who form the solid nucleus of the branch, always to be relied\r\non to maintain the authority of the committee. From their ranks come\r\nthe two principal branch officers, the President and the Secretary,\r\nupon whom the main burden of administration falls. Though never elected\r\nfor more than one year, these officers frequently remain at their posts\r\nfor many terms in succession; and their offices are in any case filled\r\nfrom a narrow circle of the ablest or most experienced members.\r\n\r\nBesides the active soldiers in the Trade Union ranks, to be counted by\r\nhundreds of thousands, we had therefore, in 1892, a smaller class of\r\nnon-commissioned officers made up of the Secretaries and Presidents of\r\nlocal Unions, branches and district committees of national societies,\r\nand of Trades Councils. Of these we estimate that there were, in\r\n1892, over 20,000 holding office at any one time. These men form the\r\nbackbone of the Trade Union world, and constitute the vital element\r\nin working-class politics. Dependent for their livelihood on manual\r\nlabour, they retain to the full the workman’s sense of insecurity,\r\nprivation, and thwarted aspirations. Their own singleness of purpose,\r\nthe devotion with which they serve their fellows in laborious\r\noffices with only nominal remuneration, and their ingenuous faith in\r\nthe indefinite improvement of human nature by education and better\r\nconditions of life, all combine to maintain their enthusiasm for every\r\nkind of social reform. Thus they are always open to new ideas, provided\r\nthese are put forward in a practical shape, by men whose character and\r\nintelligence they respect. This class of non-commissioned officers it\r\nis which has, in the main, proved the progressive element in the Trade\r\nUnion world, and which actually determines the trend of working-class\r\nthought. Nevertheless these men are not the real administrators\r\nof Trade Union affairs except in the little local Unions, run by\r\nmen working at their trade, which are fast disappearing. In the\r\ngreat national and county Unions the branch or lodge officials are\r\nstrictly bound down by detailed rules, and are allowed practically no\r\nopportunity of acting on their own initiative. The actual government of\r\nthe Trade Union world rests exclusively in the hands of a class apart,\r\nthe salaried officers of the great societies.\r\n\r\nThis Civil Service of the Trade Union world, non-existent in 1850,\r\nnumbered, in 1892, between six and seven hundred.[597] Alike in the\r\nmodern organisation of industry, and in the machinery of Democratic\r\npolitics, it was, even in 1892, taking every day a position of greater\r\ninfluence and importance. Yet if we may judge from the fact that we\r\nhave not met with a single description of this new governing class,\r\nthe character of its influence, and even its existence, had hitherto\r\nremained almost unobserved. To understand the part played by this Civil\r\nService, both in the Trade Union Movement and in the modern industrial\r\nState, the reader must realise the qualities which the position\r\ndemands, the temptations to which its holders are exposed, and the\r\nduties which they are called upon to perform.\r\n\r\nThe salaried official of a great Trade Union occupies a unique\r\nposition. He belongs neither to the middle nor to the working class.\r\nThe interests which he represents are exclusively those of the manual\r\nworking class from which he has sprung, and his duties bring him into\r\nconstant antagonism with the brain-working, property-owning class. On\r\nthe other hand, his daily occupation is that of a brain-worker, and\r\nhe is accordingly sharply marked off from the typical proletarian,\r\ndependent for his livelihood on physical toil.\r\n\r\nThe promotion of a working man to the position of a salaried\r\nbrain-worker effects a complete and sudden change in his manner of\r\nlife. Instead of working every day at a given task, he suddenly finds\r\nhimself master of his own time, with duties which, though laborious\r\nenough, are indefinite, irregular, and easily neglected. The first\r\nrequisite for his new post is therefore personal self-control. No\r\ngreater misfortune can befall an energetic and public-spirited Trade\r\nUnionist, who on occasions takes a glass too much, than to become\r\nthe salaried officer of his Union. So long as he is compelled, at\r\nleast nine days out of every fourteen, to put in a hard day’s manual\r\nwork at regular hours, his propensity to drink may not prevent him\r\nfrom being an expert craftsman and an efficient citizen. Such a man,\r\nelected General Secretary or District Delegate, is doomed, almost\r\ninevitably, to become an habitual drunkard. Instead of being confined\r\nto the factory or the mine, he is now free to come and go at his own\r\nwill, and drink is therefore accessible to him at all hours. His\r\nwork involves constant travelling, and frequent waiting about in\r\nstrange towns, with little choice of resort beyond the public-house.\r\nThe regular periods of monotonous physical exertion are replaced by\r\nunaccustomed intellectual strain, irregular hours, and times of anxiety\r\nand excitement, during which he will be worried and enticed to drink\r\nby nearly every one he meets. And in addition to this the habitual\r\ndrunkenness of a Trade Union official, though it involves discredit,\r\nseldom brings dismissal from his post. No discovery is more astounding\r\nto the middle-class investigator than the good-natured tolerance with\r\nwhich a Trade Union will, year after year, re-elect officers who are\r\nwell known to be hopeless drunkards. The rooted dislike which working\r\nmen have to “do a man out of his job” is strengthened, in the case\r\nof a Trade Union official, by a generous recognition of the fact\r\nthat his service of his fellows has unfitted him to return to manual\r\nlabour. Moreover, the ordinary member of a Trade Union overlooks the\r\nvital importance of skilled and efficient administration. He imagines\r\nthat the drunkenness and the consequent incompetency of his General\r\nSecretary means only some delay in the routine work of the office, or,\r\nat the worst, some small malversation of the Society’s funds. So long\r\nas the cash keeps right, and the reports appear at regular intervals,\r\nit seems never to occur to him that it is for lack of headship that his\r\nSociety is losing ground in all directions, and forgoing, in one week,\r\nmore than a dishonest Secretary could steal in a year.\r\n\r\nFortunately the almost invariable practice of electing the salaried\r\nofficials from the ranks of the non-commissioned officers tends to\r\nexclude the workman deficient in personal self-control. The evenings\r\nand holidays spent in clerical duties for the branch do not attract\r\nthe free liver, whilst the long apprenticeship in inferior offices\r\ngives his fellow-workmen ample opportunity of knowing his habits. Thus\r\nwe find that the salaried officials of the old-established Unions\r\nare usually decorous and even dignified in their personal habits. An\r\nincreasing number of them are rigid teetotalers, whilst many others\r\nresolutely refuse, at the risk of personal unpopularity, all convivial\r\ndrinking with their members.\r\n\r\nBut another danger--one which would not immediately have occurred\r\nto the middle-class investigator--besets the workman who becomes a\r\nsalaried official of his Union. The following extract, taken from the\r\ngraphic narrative we have already quoted, explains how it appears to a\r\nthoughtful artisan:\r\n\r\n And now begins a change which may possibly wreck his whole\r\n Trade Union career. As Branch Secretary, working at his\r\n trade, our friend, though superior in energy and ability to\r\n the rank and file of his members, remained in close touch\r\n with their feelings and desires. His promotion to a salaried\r\n office brings him wider knowledge and larger ideas. To the\r\n ordinary Trade Unionist the claim of the workman is that\r\n of Justice. He believes, almost as a matter of principle,\r\n that in any dispute the capitalist is in the wrong and the\r\n workman in the right. But when, as a District Delegate,\r\n it becomes his business to be perpetually investigating\r\n the exact circumstances of the men’s quarrels, negotiating\r\n with employers, and arranging compromises, he begins more\r\n and more to recognise that there is something to be urged\r\n on the other side. There is also an unconscious bias at\r\n work. Whilst the points at issue no longer affect his own\r\n earnings or conditions of employment, any disputes between\r\n his members and their employers increase his work and add\r\n to his worry. The former vivid sense of the privations and\r\n subjection of the artisan’s life gradually fades from his\r\n mind; and he begins more and more to regard all complaints\r\n as perverse and unreasonable.\r\n\r\n With this intellectual change may come a more invidious\r\n transformation. Nowadays the salaried officer of a great\r\n Union is courted and flattered by the middle class.\r\n He is asked to dine with them, and will admire their\r\n well-appointed houses, their fine carpets, the ease and\r\n luxury of their lives. Possibly, too, his wife begins to be\r\n dissatisfied. She will point out how So-and-so, who served\r\n his apprenticeship in the same shop, is now well-off, and\r\n steadily making a fortune; and she reminds her husband\r\n that, had he worked half as hard for himself as he has for\r\n others, he also might now be rich, and living in comfort\r\n without fear of the morrow. He himself sees the truth of\r\n this. He knows many men who, with less ability and energy\r\n than himself, have, by steady pursuit of their own ends,\r\n become foremen, managers, or even small employers, whilst\r\n he is receiving only £2 or £4 a week without any chance of\r\n increase. And so the remarks of his wife and her relations,\r\n the workings of his own mind, the increase of years, a\r\n growing desire to be settled in life and to see the future\r\n clear before him and his children, and perhaps also a little\r\n envy of his middle-class friends, all begin insidiously,\r\n silently, unknown even to himself, to work a change in his\r\n views of life. He goes to live in a little villa in a lower\r\n middle-class suburb. The move leads to his dropping his\r\n workmen friends; and his wife changes her acquaintances.\r\n With the habits of his new neighbours he insensibly adopts\r\n more and more of their ideas. Gradually he finds himself at\r\n issue with his members, who no longer agree to his proposals\r\n with the old alacrity. All this comes about by degrees,\r\n neither party understanding the cause. He attributes the\r\n breach to the influences of a clique of malcontents, or\r\n perhaps to the wild views held by the younger generation.\r\n They think him proud and “stuck-up”, over-cautious and even\r\n apathetic in trade affairs. His manner to his members,\r\n and particularly to the unemployed who call for donation,\r\n undergoes a change. He begins to look down upon them all\r\n as “common workmen”; but the unemployed he scorns as men\r\n who have made a failure of their lives; and his scorn is\r\n probably undisguised. This arouses hatred. As he walks to\r\n the office in his tall hat and good overcoat, with a smart\r\n umbrella, curses not loud but deep are muttered against him\r\n by members loitering in search of work, and as these get\r\n jobs in other towns they spread stories of his arrogance\r\n and haughtiness. So gradually he loses the sympathy and\r\n support of those upon whom his position depends. At last\r\n the climax comes. A great strike threatens to involve the\r\n Society in desperate war. Unconsciously biased by distaste\r\n for the hard and unthankful work which a strike entails, he\r\n finds himself in small sympathy with the men’s demands, and\r\n eventually arranges a compromise on terms distasteful to\r\n a large section of his members. The gathering storm-cloud\r\n now breaks. At his next appearance before a general meeting\r\n cries of “treachery” and “bribery” are raised. Alas! it\r\n is not bribery. Not his morality but his intellect is\r\n corrupted. Secure in the consciousness of freedom from\r\n outward taint, he faces the meeting boldly, throws the\r\n accusation back in their faces, and for the moment carries\r\n his point. But his position now becomes rapidly unbearable.\r\n On all sides he finds suspicion deepening into hatred. The\r\n members, it is true, re-elect him to his post; but they\r\n elect at the same time an Executive Committee pledged to\r\n oppose him in every way.[598] All this time he still fails\r\n to understand what has gone wrong, and probably attributes\r\n it to the intrigues of jealous opponents eager for his\r\n place. Harassed on all sides, distrusted and thwarted by his\r\n Executive Committee, at length he loses heart. He looks out\r\n for some opening of escape, and finally accepting a small\r\n appointment, lays down his Secretaryship with heartfelt\r\n relief and disappears for ever from the Trade Union world.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Union official who became too genteel for his post was,\r\nlike the habitual drunkard, an exception. The average Secretary or\r\nDistrict Delegate was too shrewd to get permanently out of touch with\r\nhis constituents. Nevertheless the working man who became a salaried\r\nofficer had to pick his way with considerable care between the dangers\r\nattendant on the _rôle_ of boon companion and those inseparable from\r\nthe more reputable but more hated character of the superior person.\r\nTo personal self-control he had to add strength and independence of\r\ncharacter, a real devotion to the class from which he had sprung, and\r\na sturdy contempt for the luxury and “gentility” of those with whom he\r\nwas brought in contact. All this remains as true to-day as it was in\r\n1892, but the general advance in education and sobriety, and the steady\r\ntendency towards an assimilation of manners among all classes, render\r\nthe contrasts of the social nineteenth century daily less marked.\r\nThe Trade Union official of 1920 finds it much easier to maintain a\r\nposition of self-respecting courtesy both among his own members and\r\namong the employers, officials, and middle-class politicians with whom\r\nhe is brought in contact.\r\n\r\nWe break off now to describe, in the following chapters, the\r\ndevelopment of the Trade Union Movement from 1890 to 1920, and to\r\ndiscuss some of its outstanding features.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[577] During the whole course of the nineteenth century the Government\r\nfailed to ascertain, with any approach to accuracy, how numerous the\r\nTrade Unionists were. Until the appointment of Mr. John Burnett as\r\nLabour Correspondent of the Board of Trade in 1886, no attempt was\r\nmade to collect, officially, any information about Trade Unionism. The\r\nfive annual volumes published by Mr. Burnett between 1886 and 1891\r\ncontained a fund of information on Trade Union statistics, and the\r\nreturns became year by year more complete. The report for 1891 gave\r\nparticulars of 431 Unions with 1,109,014 members, whilst that for 1892\r\ncovered a slightly larger total. But, restricted as he was to societies\r\nmaking returns in the precise form required, Mr. Burnett was unable to\r\nget at many existing Unions, whilst a considerable deduction had to be\r\nmade from his total for members counted both in district organisations\r\nand in federations. The Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies gave\r\nparticulars, in his Report for 1892 (House of Commons Paper, 146--II.\r\nof March 28, 1893), of 1,063,000 members in 442 registered Trade Unions\r\nalone, after deducting organisations which are not Trade Unions, and\r\nmany duplicate entries. A large number of societies, such as the\r\nNorthern Counties Amalgamated Weavers’ Association, many of the Miners’\r\nUnions, the English and Scottish Typographical Associations, the United\r\nKingdom Society of Coachmakers, the Flint Glass Makers, the Yorkshire\r\nGlass Bottle Makers, and others were then (as most of them still are)\r\nunregistered. Thus our own statistics revealed a 50 per cent greater\r\nTrade Union membership than the Government figures. It is difficult to\r\nstate with exactness the number of separate organisations included, as\r\nthis must depend upon the manner in which federal bodies are regarded.\r\nThese exhibit almost infinite variations in character, from the mere\r\n“centre of communication” maintained by the thirty-two completely\r\nindependent local societies of Coopers, to the rigid unity of the forty\r\ndistrict organisations which make up the Amalgamated Association of\r\nOperative Cotton-spinners. The number of independent societies may be\r\nreckoned at either 930 or at anything up to 1750, according to the view\r\ntaken of federal Unions and federations. We put it approximately at\r\n1100.\r\n\r\n[578] See our _Industrial Democracy_ and _Problems of Modern Industry_:\r\nalso _Men’s and Women’s Wages, should they be Equal?_ by Mrs. Sidney\r\nWebb, 1919.\r\n\r\n[579] There were, at this date, altogether about 45,000 Unionists in\r\nOldham, but of these some 20,000 were women.\r\n\r\n[580] Of these, some 80,000 were women. Fully four-fifths of all the\r\norganised women workers were, at this date, included in the Lancashire\r\ntextile Trade Unions.\r\n\r\n[581] Including the Channel Islands and the Isle of Man, which\r\ncontained together about 1285 Trade Unionists.\r\n\r\n[582] Included in the above total were 99,650 women in 52 Unions,\r\ndistributed among the groups as follows:\r\n\r\nEngineering and Metal Trades 2,850 Building and Furniture Trades 300\r\nMining ... Textile Manufactures 80,900 Clothing and Leather Trades\r\n8,650 Printing Trades 400 Miscellaneous Crafts 3,450 Labourers and\r\nTransport Workers 3,100 ------ 99,650\r\n\r\nWe may add that the subsequently published Board of Trade statistics\r\nfor 1892, arranged on a slightly different classification, gave the\r\nfollowing totals by industrial groups:\r\n\r\n Metal, Engineering and Shipbuilding   279,534\r\n Building                              157,971\r\n Mining and Quarrying                  315,272\r\n Textile                               204,022\r\n Clothing                               83,299\r\n Transport                             154,947\r\n Other Trades                          307,313\r\n                                    ----------\r\n                                     1,502,358\r\n\r\nSee Report on Trade Unions for 1901 (Cd. 773).\r\n\r\n[583] The Boilermakers claim only to have been established since 1834,\r\nbut there is evidence of the existence of the Society in 1832. In\r\na few other cases, notably those of the Stonemasons, Plumbers, and\r\nBricklayers, we have been able to carry the history of the organisation\r\nfurther back than has hitherto been suspected.\r\n\r\n[584] The equally archaic port Unions of the Sailmakers, dating, like\r\nthose of the Shipwrights, from the last century, were united in the\r\nFederation of Sailmakers of Great Britain and Ireland (established\r\n1890), with 1250 members.\r\n\r\n[585] Of these the most important were the Steam-Engine Makers’ Society\r\n(established 1824, 6000 members), the Associated Blacksmiths’ Society\r\n(a Scottish organisation, established 1857, 2300 members), the United\r\nKingdom Pattern Makers’ Association (established 1872, 2500 members),\r\nthe National Society of Amalgamated Brassworkers (established 1872,\r\n6500 members), the United Journeymen Brassfounders’ Association of\r\nGreat Britain and Ireland (established 1866, 2500 members), and the\r\nUnited Machine Workers’ Association (established 1844, 2500 members).\r\n\r\n[586] The makers of tin plates had a Union in South Wales (established\r\n1871, and reorganised 1887) which claimed a membership of 10,000. The\r\nNational Amalgamated Tinplate Workers’ Association of Great Britain\r\n(established 1876) had 3000 members, and the General Union of Sheet\r\nMetal Workers (established 1861) had 1250 members.\r\n\r\n[587] The Alliance Cabinetmakers’ Association (established 1865,\r\n5500 members) and the National Association of Operative Plasterers\r\n(established 1862, 7000 members).\r\n\r\n[588] The South Wales miners were, at this date, in a transition\r\nstate. The Miners’ Federation had gained a considerable following in\r\nMonmouthshire and Glamorgan, but the bulk of the men still adhered\r\nto the Sliding Scale machinery, claiming 36,000 members, for the\r\nmaintenance of which a fortnightly contribution was usually deducted\r\nby the employers from the miners’ earnings. The Forest of Dean Miners’\r\nAssociation (4000 members) seceded from the Federation in 1893. A small\r\nMiners’ Union (2250 members) at West Bromwich also held aloof.\r\n\r\n[589] The Cotton-spinners’ Union was then composed exclusively of adult\r\nmales, the boy “piecers” being brigaded in subordinate organisations.\r\nIn the Cotton-weavers and Card-room Operatives’ Unions women formed a\r\nlarge majority of the members.\r\n\r\n[590] The United Kingdom Society of Coachmakers (established 1834) had\r\n5500 members. The Mutual Association of Coopers (established 1878) was\r\nthen a loose federation of old-fashioned local Unions, with about 6000\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n[591] We did not include in the above statistics the Unions in classes\r\nnot included among the manual workers. The National Union of Teachers,\r\nestablished 1870, was, already in 1892, a powerful organisation with\r\n23,000 members. The Telegraph Clerks, Life Assurance Agents, and Shop\r\nAssistants also had Unions varying from 1000 to 5000 members, and there\r\nwere two organisations of postal employees. The National Unions of\r\nClerks and Domestic Servants were less definitely established. There\r\nwere also small societies among the London Dock Foremen and Clerks and\r\nthe Poplar Ships’ Clerks.\r\n\r\nNor did we include such essentially benefit societies as the Marine\r\nEngineers’ Union (9500 members) and the United Kingdom Pilots’\r\nAssociation, which were composed largely of workmen belonging for trade\r\npurposes to particular Trade Unions.\r\n\r\n[592] The census figures for 1891 merge, for each trade, “workmen,\r\nassistants, apprentices, and labourers.” They do not, for instance,\r\ndistinguish between Bricklayers and Bricklayers’ Labourers, who belong\r\nto very different Trade Unions. Under Hosiers or Hatters are included\r\nshop-keepers and their assistants, as well as the manufacturing\r\noperatives.\r\n\r\n[593] Old members often recall the days when the men used to come to\r\nthe club straight from work, and “in their dirt.” They frequently\r\nascribe the orderly behaviour at club meetings at the present time,\r\nas compared with the rowdiness of the past, largely to this change of\r\nhabit, itself a direct result of the reduction of the hours of labour.\r\n\r\n[594] Many Unions forbid all drinking during the branch meeting.\r\n\r\n[595] In the great Amalgamated Societies District Committees, composed\r\nof representatives of local branches, are formed in the great\r\nindustrial Centres, and decide on the trade policy to be adopted by\r\ntheir constituent branches. These decisions must be confirmed by the\r\nCentral Executive.\r\n\r\n[596] The travelling card, formerly called a “blank,” is now, in most\r\ncases, a small book of receipt forms. On it is recorded the particulars\r\nof his membership, and the date to which he has paid his contributions.\r\nAlong with it he receives a complete list of the public-houses which\r\nserve as the Society’s Lodge-houses, and also a list of the names and\r\naddresses of the Lodge secretaries.\r\n\r\n[597] We did not include in this figure a large class of men who are\r\nindirectly paid officials of Trade Unions, such as the checkweighers\r\namong the coal-miners, and the “collectors” among the cotton-weavers,\r\ncardroom-workers, etc. The checkweigher, as we have stated (p. 305), is\r\nelected and paid weekly wages, not by the members of the Trade Union,\r\nbut by all the miners in a particular coal-pit. But as Trade Unionism\r\nand the election of a checkweigher are practically coincident, he\r\nfrequently serves as lodge secretary, etc. The collectors employed by\r\ncertain Trade Unions to go from house to house and collect the members’\r\ncontributions are remunerated by a percentage on their collections.\r\nThough not strictly salaried officials, they serve as Trade Union\r\nrecruiting agents, as well as intermediaries between members and\r\nthe central office, for complaints, appeals, and the circulation of\r\ninformation.\r\n\r\n[598] We have here another instance of the deeply rooted objection on\r\nthe part of workmen to “sack” their officials. A Society will make the\r\nlife of an unpopular official unbearable, and will thwart him in every\r\ndirection; but so long as he hangs on he has a safe berth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nTHIRTY YEARS’ GROWTH\r\n\r\n[1890-1920]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1892, after more than two centuries of development, Trade Unionism\r\nin the United Kingdom numbered, as we have seen, little more than\r\na million and a half of members, in a community approaching forty\r\nmillions; or about 4 per cent of the census population and including\r\npossibly 20 per cent of the adult male manual-working wage-earners. At\r\nthe beginning of 1920, as we estimate, the number of Trade Unionists\r\nis well over six millions, in a community that does not quite reach\r\nforty-eight millions; being over 12 per cent of the census population\r\nand including probably as many as 60 per cent[599] of all the adult\r\nmale manual-working wage-earners in the kingdom. With the exception of\r\nslight pauses in 1893-95, 1902-4, and 1908-9, this remarkable growth in\r\naggregate membership has been continuous during the whole thirty years.\r\n\r\nIt is important to notice the continuous acceleration of this increase.\r\nFor a few years after the high tide of 1889-92 the aggregate membership\r\ndropped slightly. When in 1897 it started to rise again it took a whole\r\ndecade to add half a million to the total of 1892-96. Three years more\r\nbrought a second half million: a total growth in the eighteen years\r\nfrom 1892 to 1910 of about a million, or only about 66 per cent. It\r\nthen took only three or four years to add another million; whilst\r\nduring the last few years the increase has not fallen far short of half\r\na million a year, or of the order of 10 per cent per annum. Trade Union\r\nmembership has, in fact, doubled in the last eight years.[600]\r\n\r\nNo less significant is the fact that the increase has not been confined\r\nto particular industries, particular localities, or a particular\r\nsex, but has taken place, more or less, over the whole field. It is\r\ncommon in varying degrees to the skilled, the semi-skilled, and the\r\nunskilled workers. Even the women, still much less organised than the\r\nmen, have in 1920 five or six times as many Trade Unionists as they\r\nhad thirty years previously; and have trebled or quadrupled the then\r\nproportion of Trade Union membership to the adult women manual-working\r\nwage-earners. Financially, too, the Trade Unions have, on the whole,\r\ngreatly advanced; and their aggregate accumulated funds in 1920 (apart\r\nfrom the assets of their Approved Society sections under the National\r\nInsurance Act) exceed fifteen millions sterling; being about ten times\r\nas much as in 1890, and constituting a “fighting fund” unimaginably\r\ngreater than ever entered the mind of Gast or Doherty, Martin Jude\r\nor William Newton, or any other Trade Union leader of the preceding\r\ncentury. It is the stages and incidents of this past thirty years’\r\ngrowth that we have now to describe. We shall refer incidentally\r\nto half-a-dozen of the more important strikes of the generation;\r\nbut nowadays it is not so much industrial disputes that constitute\r\nlandmarks of Trade Union history as the steps, often statutory or\r\npolitical in character, by which the Movement advances in public\r\ninfluence and in a recognised participation in the government of\r\nindustry. During the present century, at any rate, the action of Trade\r\nUnionism on legislation, and of legislation on Trade Unionism, has been\r\nincessant and reciprocal. The growing strength of the Movement has\r\nbeen marked by a series of legislative changes which have ratified and\r\nlegalised the increasing influence of the wage-earners’ combinations\r\nin the government both of industry and political relations. And every\r\none of these statutes--notably the Trade Disputes Act of 1906, the\r\nTrade Boards Act of 1908, the Coal Mines Regulation (Eight Hours) Act\r\nof 1908, the National Insurance Act of 1911, the Trade Union Act of\r\n1913, the Corn Production Act of 1917, and the Trade Boards Extension\r\nAct of 1918--have been marked by immediate extensions of Trade Union\r\nmembership and improvements in Trade Union organisation in the\r\nindustries concerned.\r\n\r\nDuring the thirty years which have elapsed since 1890 the progress of\r\nthe Trade Union Movement, enormous as it has been, has been accompanied\r\nby relatively little change in the internal structure of the several\r\nUnions. What has occurred has been a marked change in the relative\r\nposition and influence of the different sections of the Trade Union\r\nworld, and even in its composition. Some sections have declined\r\nrelatively to others. Even more significant is the vastly greater\r\nconsolidation of the Trade Unionism of 1920 than that of 1890. Not only\r\nhave many more of the societies grown into organisations of numerical\r\nand financial strength, but there has also been developed, especially\r\nduring recent years, an interesting network of federations among Unions\r\nin the same industry, and often among cognate or associated industries,\r\nsome of which, undertaking negotiations on a national scale for a whole\r\nindustry, have become more influential and important than any but the\r\nlargest Unions.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COTTON OPERATIVES\r\n\r\nThe most notable of these changes is the decline in relative influence\r\nof the cotton operatives. It is not that the Unions of Spinners,\r\nWeavers and Card-room Operatives have decreased in membership or\r\nin accumulated funds. On the contrary, they have in the aggregate\r\nduring the past thirty years more than doubled their membership;\r\nand the Amalgamated Association of Operative Cotton Spinners, with\r\nthree-quarters of a million pounds belonging to its 25,000 members\r\n(exclusive of 26,000 piecers), is, now as formerly, the wealthiest\r\nTrade Union of any magnitude. Nor have these Unions in any sense lost\r\ntheir hold on their own trade, at least in its central district of\r\nLancashire and Cheshire, though its outlying areas in Derbyshire,\r\nYorkshire, and Glasgow are still somewhat neglected. But the growth of\r\nTrade Unionism in other industries has reduced the “Cotton Men” from\r\nten or twelve to four or five per cent of the Trades Union Congress;\r\nand, owing partly to internal differences, their leading personalities\r\nno longer dominate the counsels of the Movement. The excellent\r\norganisation of the Cotton Trade Unions has been maintained; but it\r\nhas not been copied by other trades, and their internecine dissensions\r\nhave detracted from the influence of their various federations. There\r\nhas been, in fact, during the whole thirty years, only two or three\r\nimportant incidents. A general strike of cotton-spinners took place in\r\n1893, when all the mills were stopped for no less than twenty weeks.\r\nThe employers had demanded a reduction of 10 per cent, whilst the\r\nTrade Union urged that the depression should be met by placing all the\r\nmills on short time. This stoppage was at last brought to an end by\r\nagreement between the employers and the Trade Union, arrived at without\r\nexternal intervention in a fourteen hours continuous session, which\r\nmade the reduction in rates only 7d. in the £ (2.916 instead of 10\r\nper cent), and included elaborate arrangements for future adjustment\r\nof wages and other differences by mutual discussion without cessation\r\nof work.[601] This “Brooklands Agreement,” which we described in our\r\n_Industrial Democracy_, governed the spinning trade from 1893 to 1905,\r\nbut was in the latter year formally terminated by the Unions concerned,\r\non the ground that the machinery worked both slowly and in such a way\r\nas to hamper the operatives in obtaining the advantage of good times.\r\nProvisional arrangements were made, but these did not prevent a strike\r\nof seven weeks in 1908, which ended in a compromise advantageous to the\r\noperatives. Apart from minor and local disputes, frequently about bad\r\nmaterial or refusal to work with a non-Unionist, there was, however, no\r\nforward movement, notably with regard to the hours of labour. In 1902\r\na slight amendment of the Factory Act was secured by agreement with\r\nthe employers, by which the factory week was reduced from 56½ to\r\n55½ hours; and with this the trade remained contented. Right down\r\nto 1919 there was no important trade movement, but in February of that\r\nyear all sections of the cotton operatives claimed their share in the\r\ngeneral reduction of hours that was proceeding; and, after prolonged\r\nnegotiations, 300,000 operatives struck in June. When it was seen that\r\nthe stoppage of the mills had become general, the employers gave way\r\nand conceded a Forty-eight Hours week, which has not yet been embodied\r\nin law, accompanied by a 30 per cent advance in piece rates so as to\r\ninvolve no reduction of earnings.\r\n\r\nThe organisation of the cotton operatives, whilst remaining\r\nessentially as described in our _Industrial Democracy_, has gone\r\non increasing in federal complexity. The various sections--notably\r\nspinners with their attendant piecers; weavers, including winders,\r\nand in some towns also warpers, beamers, and reelers; card, blowing\r\nand ring-room operatives; warp-dressers and warpers; tape-sizers;\r\nbeamers, twisters and drawers; and overlookers--continue to be\r\norganised in very autonomous local bodies, which are styled sometimes\r\nsocieties or associations, and sometimes merely branches, and which\r\nvary in number in the different sections from half-a-dozen to ten\r\ntimes as many. But these are nearly all doubly united, first in a\r\nfederal body for the whole of each section (which may be styled an\r\namalgamation, a federation, an association, or a General Union of\r\nthe section), and also in a local “Cotton Trades Federation” or\r\n“Textile Trades Federation,” which combines the local organisations\r\nof the weavers and sometimes other sections in each of a couple of\r\ndozen geographical districts in Lancashire and Cheshire. The weavers’\r\n“amalgamation,” and other sections of the “manufacturing” trade, are\r\nfurther united in the Northern Counties Amalgamated Association, with\r\n175,000 members. Finally, all the federal organisations of the several\r\nsections are brought together in the United Textile Factory Workers’\r\nAssociation, which focuses the opinion of all the cotton operatives,\r\nincluding the Amalgamated Association of Bleachers and Dyers, on those\r\nfundamental issues on which they are conscious of a common and an equal\r\ninterest.[602]\r\n\r\nThe officials of the Cotton Trade Unions--herein differing from those\r\nof the greatly developed General Union of Textile Workers, which has\r\norganised the (principally women) woollen weavers--have remained\r\npredominantly technicians, devoting themselves almost entirely to the\r\nprotection of their members’ trade interests, without taking much part\r\nin the wider interests now largely influencing the Trade Union world,\r\nand showing little sympathy either in larger federations or in the new\r\nspirit. They have been slow to take an active part in the political\r\ndevelopment of the Trade Union world, which has manifested itself, as\r\nwe shall describe in a subsequent chapter, in the organisation of the\r\nLabour Party. This backwardness may be ascribed, in some degree, to the\r\npolitical history of Lancashire, where an ancestral Conservatism still\r\nlingers, and where it was possible, even in the twentieth century, for\r\nso prominent a Trade Union official as the late James Mawdsley, the\r\nable leader of the cotton-spinners, to stand for Parliament in 1906 as\r\na member of the Conservative Party. The influence of an exceptionally\r\nlarge proportion of Roman Catholics among the cotton operatives must\r\nalso be noted. It is a unique feature of the technical officials of\r\nthe Cotton Unions that they have frequently been willing to serve\r\nthe industry as the paid officials of the Employers’ Associations\r\nwhen they have been offered higher salaries. Their main duty, whether\r\nacting for the employers or the workmen, is to secure uniformity in\r\nthe application of the Collective Agreements as between mill and mill;\r\nand such a duty, it is argued, like that of the valuer or accountant,\r\nis independent of personal opinion or bias, and can be rendered with\r\nequal fidelity to either client. This was not at first resented by the\r\nworkmen, who even saw some advantage in the Employers’ Association\r\nbeing served by officers thoroughly acquainted with the complicated\r\ntechnicalities as the operatives saw them. There has, however, latterly\r\nbeen a change of feeling; and though such transfers of services cannot\r\nbe prevented (the Employers’ Associations constantly finding the Trade\r\nUnion official the best man available), they are now resented.[603]\r\n\r\nIt is felt in some quarters that many of the “cotton men” have fallen\r\nout of harmony with the newer currents of thought in the Trade Union\r\nworld. It is alleged that they accept too implicitly the employers’\r\nassumptions, and do not sympathise with aspirations of more fundamental\r\nchange than a variation of wages or hours. But the influence of the\r\n“cotton men” is, in the Trade Union world, still important for their\r\nspecific contribution, to Trade Union theory and practice, of equal\r\npiecework rates for both sexes; of a rigid refusal to allow an employer\r\nto make the inferiority either of any workers or of any machines that\r\nhe chooses to employ an excuse for deductions from the Standard Rate,\r\nand of the utmost possible improvement of machinery so long as the\r\npiecework rates are strictly controlled by Collective Bargaining and\r\nfirmly embodied in rigidly enforced lists--points on which many Trade\r\nUnionists who would deem themselves “advanced” have not yet attained\r\nthe same level.[604]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE BUILDING TRADES\r\n\r\nThe Building Trades have lost their relative position in the Trade\r\nUnion world to nearly as great an extent as the cotton operatives.\r\nThirty years ago their representatives stood for 10 per cent of the\r\nTrades Union Congress, whereas to-day they probably do not represent 3\r\nper cent of its membership. They have, for a whole generation, supplied\r\nno influential leader. The only large society in this section, the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Carpenters, Cabinetmakers, and Joiners (133,000\r\nmembers), has more than doubled its membership since 1890, drawing\r\nin various small societies of cabinetmakers, and carpenters, but not\r\nyet the older General Union of Carpenters and Joiners, which counts\r\n15,000 members; and so, too, has the small but solid United Operative\r\nPlumbers’ Society, with 14,000 members--neither of them, however,\r\ncommanding the allegiance of anything like the whole of its craft. The\r\nnumerous small societies of painters have, for the most part, drawn\r\nthemselves together in the National Amalgamated Society of Operative\r\nHouse and Ship Painters and Decorators (30,000 members); whilst the\r\nNational Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association (12,500 members)\r\nrepresents a union of many small societies. Altogether the Trade Unions\r\nin the building trades, including all the little local societies, have\r\nprobably done no more than double their membership of 1892, and the\r\nincrease has been relatively least in the most skilled grades. This\r\nis due, in part, to an actual decline in the trade, the total numbers\r\nenumerated in the 1911 census being actually less than in that of 1901,\r\nthe fall being even greater down to 1919, when it was estimated that\r\nonly seven-twelfths as many men were at work at building as in 1901.\r\n\r\nThe story of the Building Trade Unions during the thirty years is\r\none of innumerable small sectional and local disputes with their\r\nemployers--taking the form, during 1913, of repeated sudden strikes in\r\nthe London area against non-Unionists, forced on by the “hot-heads”\r\nand discountenanced by the Executive Committees, and leading, in 1914,\r\nto a general lock-out by the London Master Builders’ Association. The\r\nemployers demanded that the Trade Unions should penalise members who\r\nstruck without authority, and that the Unions should put up a pecuniary\r\ndeposit which might be forfeited when a strike occurred in violation\r\nof the Working Rules. They also insisted on each workman signing a\r\npersonal agreement to work quietly with non-Unionists, under penalty of\r\na fine of 20s. In the lock-out that ensued the whole building trade of\r\nthe Metropolis was stopped for over six months. Efforts at a settlement\r\nin June were rejected on ballot of the operatives; and whilst signs\r\nof weakening occurred among the operatives the National Federation of\r\nBuilding Trade Employers had decided on a national lock-out throughout\r\nthe kingdom in order to secure the employers’ terms, when the outbreak\r\nof war brought the struggle to an end, and work was resumed practically\r\non the old conditions.\r\n\r\nDuring the war, when the bulk of the operatives were enrolled in the\r\narmy, and building was restricted to the most urgently needed works,\r\ndisputes remained in abeyance. At the beginning of 1918 a new start\r\nwas made in the organisation of the industry by the establishment\r\nof a National Federation of Building Trade Operatives, itself a\r\ndevelopment from a previous National Building Trades Council, in\r\nwhich all the national Trade Unions, 13 in number, for the first\r\ntime joined together. Notwithstanding great differences in numerical\r\nstrength, the Unions agreed to constitute the Federation Executive of\r\ntwo representatives from each national union. The Federation is formed\r\nof local branches, each of which is composed of the branches in the\r\nlocality of the nationally affiliated Unions, governed by the aggregate\r\nof the “Trades Management Committee” of such branches, acting under\r\nthe direction and control of the Federation Executive. A significant\r\nnew feature, recalling an expedient of the Trade Unionism of 1834,\r\nis the establishment of “Composite Branches” of individual building\r\ntrades operatives in localities where no branch of the separate\r\nnational unions exists. What success may attend this renewed effort at\r\nunified national organisation of the whole industry it is impossible\r\nto predict; there are signs of a movement for actual amalgamation.\r\nThe four principal Builders’ Labourers’ Unions are on the point of\r\nuniting in a strong amalgamation with 40,000 members. Other attempts at\r\namalgamation, including one among the “house builders,” the societies\r\nof bricklayers, masons and plasterers, have been voted. The Furnishing\r\nTrades Association was only prevented from merging in the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Carpenters by technical difficulties. On the other hand\r\nthe separate Scottish and Irish Unions (except for the merging of the\r\nAssociated Carpenters) stubbornly maintain their independence. Down to\r\nthe present it must be said that combination in the building trades,\r\ntorn by internecine conflicts and financially weakened by unsuccessful\r\nstrikes, has, on the whole, been falling back. The gradual change\r\nof processes, and the introduction of new materials, with an actual\r\ndecline in the numbers employed, has not been met by any improvement\r\nin the organisation of the older craft unions, whilst the workers in\r\nthe new processes have failed to achieve effective union. With the\r\ngreat demand for building since the Armistice, the Building Trades\r\nUnions have, however, shown increased vitality; and the position in\r\nthe negotiating Joint Boards, at which they are now regularly meeting\r\nthe employers’ representatives, has considerably improved. The latest\r\nachievement of the industry is the establishment, jointly with the\r\nemployers, of a “Builders’ Parliament”--largely at the instance of Mr.\r\nMalcolm Sparkes--which is the most noteworthy example of the “Whitley\r\nCouncils,” to which we shall refer later.\r\n\r\n\r\nENGINEERING AND THE METAL TRADES\r\n\r\nThe large and steadily increasing army of operatives in the various\r\nprocesses connected with metals (who are combined in Germany in a\r\nsingle gigantic Metal Workers’ Union) can be noticed here only in its\r\nthree principal sections, the engineering industry, boilermaking and\r\nship-building, and the production of iron and steel from the ore.\r\n\r\nTrade Unionism in the engineering industry, though it has, during the\r\npast thirty years, greatly increased in aggregate membership, notably\r\namong the unskilled and semi-skilled workmen employed in engineering\r\nshops, can hardly be said to have grown in strength, whether manifested\r\nin effect upon the engineering employers, who have become very strongly\r\ncombined throughout the whole kingdom, or in influence in the Trade\r\nUnion world. This relative decline must be ascribed to the continued\r\nlack of any systematic organisation of the industry as a whole; to a\r\nfailure to cope with the changing processes and systems of remuneration\r\nwhich the employers have introduced; and to the persistence of\r\ninternecine war among the rival Unions themselves.\r\n\r\nThe trouble in the engineering world came to a head in 1897,\r\nprecipitated perhaps by the employers, who wanted, as they said, to be\r\n“masters in their own shops.” The Amalgamated Society of Engineers,\r\nwhich had maintained its predominant position among the engineering\r\nworkmen, but only commanded the allegiance of a part of them, after a\r\nseries of bickerings with the employers about the technical improvement\r\nof the industry, in which the workmen had shown themselves, to say the\r\nleast, very conservative, found itself involved in a general strike\r\nand lock-out in all the principal engineering centres, nominally\r\nabout the London engineering workmen’s precipitate demand for an\r\nEight Hours Day, but substantially over the employers’ insistence on\r\nbeing masters in their own workshops, entitled to introduce what new\r\nmethods of working they chose, and whatever new systems of remuneration\r\naccording to results that they could persuade the several workmen to\r\naccept. The Union, to which apparently it did not occur to use the\r\nmethods of publicity on which William Newton and John Burnett would\r\nhave relied, failed to make clear its case to the public; and public\r\nopinion was accordingly against the engineering workmen, believing\r\nthem to be at the same time obstructive to industrial improvements and\r\nunable to formulate conditions that would safeguard their legitimate\r\ninterests. The result was that the prolonged stoppage, which reduced\r\nthe funds of the A.S.E. down to what only sufficed to meet the accrued\r\nliabilities for Superannuation Benefit, ended in a virtual victory for\r\nthe employers. The A.S.E. quickly resumed its growth and stood, in the\r\nautumn of 1919, at 320,000 members, or over five times its membership\r\nof 1892. But the sectional societies also increased in size, and down\r\nto 1919 they counted in the aggregate, as in 1892, about half as many\r\nmembers as the A.S.E. itself.[605] Meanwhile, the great development of\r\nthe engineering industry, and the successive changes in the machinery\r\nemployed, have been accompanied by the introduction of various forms\r\nof “Payment by Results,” in which the engineering Trade Unions have\r\nnot known how to prevent the reintroduction of individual bargaining.\r\nOwing to its quarrels with the various sectional societies in the\r\nindustry, the A.S.E. has been alternately in and out of the Trades\r\nUnion Congress; and, on general issues, has seldom sought to influence\r\nthe Trade Union world as much as its magnitude and position would have\r\nentitled it to do. The same may be said of the other Trade Unions\r\nin the engineering industry, which were contented to hold their own\r\nagainst their greater rival, and to see their membership progress with\r\nthe growth of the industry itself.\r\n\r\nThe elaborate constitution of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers,\r\nwhich we described in a preceding chapter, has been, during the past\r\nthirty years, repeatedly tinkered with by delegate meetings, but\r\nwithout being substantially changed. There has been a perpetual balance\r\nand deadlock of opinion, which has led to successive modifications\r\nand reactions. Alongside the skilled engineering craftsmen, of\r\ndifferent specialities in technique, there has grown up a vast number\r\nof unapprenticed and semi-skilled men, whom the Union has failed to\r\nexclude, not only from the workshops but also from the jobs formerly\r\nmonopolised by the legitimate craftsmen. Should these interlopers be\r\nadmitted to membership? At one delegate meeting (1912) the rules were\r\naltered so as to admit (“Class F”) not only all varieties of skilled\r\nengineering craftsmen, but also practically any one working in an\r\nengineering shop. This was counteracted by the tacit refusal of most\r\nbranches to carry out the decision of their own delegates; and “Class\r\nF,” which never obtained as many as 2000 members, was abolished by\r\nthe next delegate meeting (1915.) The method of remuneration has been\r\nanother bone of contention. Especially since the disastrous conflict\r\nof 1897, the employers have more and more insisted on the adoption of\r\nsystems of “payment by results” instead of the weekly time rates, to\r\nwhich the engineering operatives, like those of most of the building\r\ntrades, devotedly cling. What is to be the Union policy with regard to\r\nthese varieties of piecework and “premium bonus” systems? Failing to\r\ndiscover any device by which (as among the cotton operatives, the boot\r\nand shoe makers, and the Birmingham brassworkers) “payment by results”\r\ncan be effectively safeguarded by being subjected to collective\r\nbargaining, the Amalgamated Society of Engineers has wavered, in its\r\ndecisions and in the policy of its various districts, between (_a_)\r\nrefusing to allow any other system than timework; (_b_) limiting\r\nsystems of payment by results to “those shops in which they have\r\nalready been introduced”; (_c_) insisting, as a condition of permitting\r\npayment by results, on the “Principle of Mutuality,” which amounts to\r\nno more than the claim that the workman shall not have the piecework\r\nrates or “bonus times” arbitrarily imposed upon him, but shall be\r\npermitted individually to bargain with the foreman or rate-fixer\r\nfor better terms. The result is a chaos of inconsistent customs and\r\npractices varying from shop to shop; and withal, a tendency to a\r\ncontinuous decline in piecework rates (mitigated only by the greater\r\nor less extent to which collective “shop bargaining” prevails, and by\r\nits efficiency) which leads, in sullen resentment, to “ca’ canny,” or\r\nslow working. The third bone of contention has been how to deal with\r\nthe competing Trade Unions, which are either societies of varieties of\r\nskilled engineers who prefer to remain unabsorbed in the A.S.E., or\r\nsocieties of new classes of operatives such as machine workers, workers\r\nin brass and copper, electrical craftsmen, and others, with whom the\r\nA.S.E. found itself disputing the control of the industry. Should\r\nthese much smaller organisations be (_a_) ignored and their members\r\ntreated as non-unionists; or (_b_) admitted to joint deliberation and\r\naction in trade matters with the view to formulating a common policy;\r\nor (_c_) dealt with by amalgamation on a still broader basis than that\r\nof the A.S.E.? It would be useless to trace the results of the ebb\r\nand flow of these contrary views, which were, in the autumn of 1919,\r\nfor the time being, partly reconciled by an agreement by which six of\r\nthe competing Unions[606] are in 1920, with the A.S.E., to be merged\r\nin the Amalgamated Engineering Union with a membership of 400,000\r\nand accumulated funds amounting to nearly four millions sterling.\r\nIt remains to be seen whether this wider amalgamation will bring to\r\nengineering Trade Unionism the formulation of a systematic policy,\r\nnational organisation, and competent leadership.\r\n\r\nUnderlying all these issues, and aggravating all the disputes to which\r\nthey give rise, is the fundamental divergence between those who insist\r\non an extreme local autonomy--the district being free to strike, and\r\nfree to refuse to settle a local strike,--and those who maintain the\r\nimportance of a national unity in trade policy, and the necessity,\r\nwith centralised funds, of centralised control. Still more keen is the\r\ncontroversy between those who wish to maintain the present craftsmen’s\r\norganisation, and those who seek to enlarge it into an organisation\r\ncomprising all the workers in the industry, whether skilled or\r\nunskilled. During the past decade the discontent against the Central\r\nExecutive, especially on the Clyde, has led to a so-called “rank and\r\nfile” movement; the development of the shop steward from a mere “card\r\ninspector” and membership recruiting officer into an aggressive strike\r\nleader; and the joining together of the shop stewards (as at Glasgow,\r\nSheffield, and Coventry) into such new forms of organisation as the\r\n“Clyde Workers’ Committee,” actively promoting their own local trade\r\npolicies irrespective of the views of the Union as a whole.\r\n\r\nThe “Shop Stewards’ Movement,” which assumed some importance in the\r\nengineering industry in 1915-19, was a new development of an old\r\ninstitution in Trade Unionism--we have referred elsewhere to the\r\n“Father of the Chapel” among the compositors, and to the checkweighman\r\namong the coal-miners--which acquired a special importance owing to\r\nthe growing lack of correspondence between the membership of the Trade\r\nUnion Branch or District Council and the grouping of the workmen in\r\nthe different establishments, and also from the fact that the workmen\r\nin each establishment found themselves belonging to different Trade\r\nUnions. “The shop steward,” it has been pointed out, “was originally\r\na minor official appointed from the men in a particular workshop and\r\ncharged with the duty of seeing that all the Trade Union contributions\r\nwere paid. He had other small duties. But gradually, as the branch got\r\nmore and more out of touch with the men in the shop, these men came to\r\nlook to the official who was on the spot to represent their grievances.\r\nDuring the war the development of the shop steward movement was very\r\nrapid, particularly in the engineering industry. In some big industrial\r\nconcerns, composed of a large number of workshops, the committees\r\nof stewards from the various shops very largely took over the whole\r\nconduct of negotiations and arrangement of shop conditions. Further, a\r\nnational organisation of shop stewards was formed, at first mainly for\r\npropagandist purposes. The existing unions have considered some of the\r\nactivities of shop stewards to be unofficial, and there has been a good\r\ndeal of dissension within the unions on this score. Attempts have been\r\nmade to reach an agreement by which Shop Stewards’ Committees shall be\r\nfully recognised at once by the unions and by the managements. So far\r\nthere has been no final settlement. An agreement was made in the early\r\nsummer of 1919 between the Engineering Employers’ Federation and the\r\nUnions; how this will work in practice is not yet certain.”[607]\r\n\r\nIt must, in fact, be said that although the Engineering Trade Unions\r\nhave during the past thirty years not taken much part in general\r\nTrade Union issues, they have (in contrast with some other sections)\r\ncontributed freely in both men and ideas. We have already dwelt upon\r\nthe activities of Mr. John Burns and Mr. Tom Mann. We shall mention the\r\npolitical progress of Mr. George Barnes, who is also of the A.S.E.;\r\nwhilst the Friendly Society of Ironfounders has given Mr. Arthur\r\nHenderson to the Movement. And, in the long run possibly more important\r\neven than men, the ideas emanating from the engineering workshops have\r\nhad a more than proportionate share in the ferment of these years. The\r\nvacancy in the office of General Secretary, occasioned by the election\r\nto the House of Commons of Mr. Robert Young, was filled in the autumn\r\nof 1919 by the election of Mr. Tom Mann; and this election, together\r\nwith the great amalgamation of competing Unions brought about at the\r\nsame time, may perhaps open up a new era in engineering Trade Unionism.\r\n\r\nIn contrast with the failure of Trade Unionism in the engineering\r\ntrades either to develop a systematic organisation or to cope with the\r\nchanges in processes and methods of remuneration, the two powerful\r\nUnions of boilermakers and shipwrights have gone from strength to\r\nstrength, doubling their numbers, absorbing practically all the\r\nremaining local societies in their industry, and closely combining\r\nwith each other in policy and other activities, concluding, indeed,\r\nin the autumn of 1919 an agreement to submit to their respective\r\nmemberships a proposal for a formal amalgamation which may be joined\r\nby the strong society of Associated Blacksmiths. This would mean the\r\nconsolidation, in one powerful Union of 170,000 members, of practically\r\nall the skilled craftsmen working in the construction of the hulls of\r\nships, of boilers and tanks, and of steel bridge-work of all sorts.\r\nConcentrated largely in the ports of the north-east coast and those of\r\nthe Clyde, with strong contingents in the relatively small number of\r\nother shipbuilding centres, the boilermakers and shipwrights have held\r\ntheir own in face of all the changes in their industry, and have known\r\nhow to maintain a fairly uniform national policy.\r\n\r\nPassing from engineering and shipbuilding to the smelting of the iron\r\nand steel from the ore, the one marked advance in organisation is that\r\nof the British Steel Smelters, which, established in 1886, and in\r\n1892 having still only 2600 members, had by 1918, under the prudent\r\nleadership of Mr. John Hodge, drawn to itself over 40,000. The British\r\nsteel smelters have the credit of equipping themselves with the most\r\nefficient office in the Trade Union world, with a real statistical\r\ndepartment and a trained staff, including, for all their legal\r\nbusiness, especially that connected with compensation for accidents,\r\na qualified professional solicitor. Already before the outbreak of\r\nwar a far-seeing policy of amalgamation had been virtually decided\r\non; and in 1915 a scheme was prepared for the merging of all the six\r\nimportant Unions in the industry of obtaining the metal from the ore,\r\nincluding the operatives in the tinplate and rolling mills. The plan\r\nfor surmounting the legal and other difficulties of amalgamation, of\r\nwhich we may ascribe the authorship to Mr. John Hodge, Mr. Pugh, and\r\nMr. Percy Cole, the able officials of the British Steel Smelters’\r\nUnion, was one of extreme ingenuity as involving no more than a bare\r\nmajority of the members voting, which deserves the attention of other\r\nsocieties as a “New Model.” Three only out of the six societies (the\r\nBritish Steel Smelters’ Association, the Associated Iron and Steel\r\nWorkers of Great Britain, and the National Steel Workers’ Association)\r\nwere able to go forward in 1917,[608] when a new society, the British\r\nIron, Steel, and Kindred Trades Association, was formed. The four\r\nsocieties then created the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation, to\r\nwhich they formally ceded powers and functions affecting the members\r\nof more than one of the constituent bodies, and therefore all general\r\nnegotiations with the employers. The three old societies continued\r\nformally in existence, but they bound themselves not to enrol any new\r\nmembers, who were all to be taken by the new society, to which all the\r\nexisting members were to be continuously urged to transfer themselves\r\nvoluntarily. This process has already gone so far that the new society\r\nhas swallowed up the British Steel Smelters’ Society, which has been\r\nwound up and completely merged in the new body, into which the empty\r\nshells of the other two old bodies will presently fall. The Iron and\r\nSteel Trades Confederation will then be composed of one society only,\r\nand may be kept alive only to serve the same transitional purpose for\r\nother incoming societies.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COMPOSITORS\r\n\r\nThe printing trades have remained, during the past thirty years,\r\ncuriously stationary so far as Trade Unionism, is concerned, the\r\nLondon Society of Compositors, the Typographical Association, the\r\nScottish Typographical Association, and the Dublin Typographical\r\nSociety having, in the aggregate, increased their membership by\r\nthree-fifths and steadily increased their rates of pay and strategic\r\nstrength against their own employers, but commanding little influence\r\nin the Trade Union Movement as a whole, and in many small towns still\r\nleaving a considerable portion of the trade outside their ranks. The\r\nless-skilled workers in the papermaking and printing establishments\r\nhave greatly improved their organisation; and the National Union of\r\nPrinting and Paper Workers and the Operative Printers Assistants’\r\nSociety--both of them including women as well as men--have become\r\nlarge and effective Trade Unions. All the societies are united in the\r\npowerful Printing and Kindred Trades Federation, to which the National\r\nUnion of Journalists, now a large society, has recently affiliated.\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOT AND SHOEMAKING\r\n\r\nAmong the other constituents of the Trade Union world in which a\r\nrelative decline in influence is to be noted, is that of the boot\r\nand shoemakers. Thirty years ago the National Union of Boot and Shoe\r\nOperatives had achieved a position of great influence in the trade.\r\nIt had joined with the Employers’ Associations in building up, as\r\ndescribed in our _Industrial Democracy_, an elaborate system of Local\r\nBoards of Conciliation and Arbitration, united in a National Conference\r\nof dignity and influence, with resort to Lord James of Hereford as\r\numpire, by means of which stoppages of work were prevented, and, more\r\nimportant still, the illegitimate use of boy labour was restrained and\r\nstandard piecework rates were arrived at by collective bargaining, and\r\nauthoritatively imposed on the whole trade. In 1894 the whole machinery\r\nwas broken up, at the instance of the very employers who had agreed to\r\nit, and had co-operated for years in its working, because they found\r\nthat, under the rules and at the piecework rates prescribed, the men\r\nwere “making too much.”\r\n\r\nAfter a prolonged stoppage in 1894 the dispute was patched up by the\r\nintervention of the Labour Department of the Board of Trade; and the\r\nNational Union of Boot and Shoe Operatives, with 80,000 members, has,\r\non the whole, held its own with the employers, with less elaborate\r\nformal relations; but the work of the Union is impaired by the\r\nweakness of the organisation in the smaller workshops and the less\r\nimportant local centres of the trade.\r\n\r\nOn the other side, we have the rise to influence, not only in the\r\nTrade Union counsels but also in those of the nation, of the Women\r\nWorkers, the General Labourers, the “black-coated proletariat” of shop\r\nassistants, clerks, teachers, technicians, and officials, the miners\r\nand the railwaymen, which has been the outstanding feature of the past\r\nthirty years.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMEN WORKERS\r\n\r\nIn no section of the industrial community has the advance of Trade\r\nUnionism during the last thirty years been more marked than among the\r\nwomen workers. For the first half of this period, indeed--though the\r\naggregate women membership of Trade Unions approximately doubled--this\r\nmeant only a rise from about 100,000 in 1890 to about 200,000 in\r\n1907, mostly in the textile industries; and the number of women Trade\r\nUnionists outside those industries was in the latter year still under\r\n30,000. But the long-continued patient work of the Women’s Trade Union\r\nLeague was having its effect; and the idea of Trade Unionism was being\r\nestablished among the women workers in many different industries. Much\r\nis to be ascribed to the efforts during these years of Sir Charles and\r\nLady Dilke, who were unwearied in their assistance. In 1909, largely at\r\nthe instance of Sir Charles Dilke and the women’s leaders, especially\r\nMiss Mary Macarthur, Miss Gertrude Tuckwell, and Miss Susan Lawrence,\r\nMr. Winston Churchill, as President of the Board of Trade, carried\r\nthrough Parliament the Trade Boards Bill, which enabled a legal minimum\r\nwage to be prescribed by joint boards in four specially low-paid\r\nindustries, in which mainly women were employed. This measure not only\r\nconsiderably improved the position of the sweated workers in the chain\r\nand nail trades, the slop tailoring trade, paper box making and machine\r\nlace-making, but--as had been predicted on one side and denied on the\r\nother--greatly stimulated independent organisation among the women\r\nwhose industrial status was raised. The extension of the Trade Boards\r\nand of the legal minimum wage in 1913 to half a dozen other trades had\r\nlike effects, and the further extension of 1918 is already promising\r\nin the same direction. Trade Union membership was further greatly\r\nincreased during 1912-14 as a result of the National Insurance Act,\r\nwhich brought many thousand recruits to the Approved Society sections\r\nof the Unions. It was, however, the Great War, with its unprecedented\r\ndemand for women workers, and their admission, in “dilution” of or\r\nin substitution for men, to all sorts of occupations and processes\r\ninto which they had not previously penetrated, at earnings which they\r\nhad never before been permitted to receive, that brought the women\r\ninto Trade Unionism by the hundred thousand. The National Federation\r\nof Women Workers--the largest exclusively feminine Union--rose from\r\n11,000 in 1914 to over 60,000 in 1919. A small number of new Trade\r\nUnions exclusively for women were established in particular sections,\r\nsuch as the interesting little society of Women Acetylene Welders. The\r\nbulk of the women, however, continued to be organised in Trade Unions\r\nadmitting both sexes. Besides the various Textile Unions, there are now\r\nthousands of women in the National Union of Railwaymen, the Railway\r\nClerks’ Association, Boot and Shoe Operatives, and the Iron and Steel\r\nTrades Confederation. Most of the general labour Unions, and others\r\nlike the National Union of Printing and Paper Workers, the National\r\nUnion of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen and Clerks, the Amalgamated\r\nUnion of Co-operative and Commercial Employees and Allied Workers, had\r\nfor a couple of decades been enrolling women members; and the female\r\nmembership of these societies now grew by leaps and bounds. But the\r\ngreater part of the field of women’s employment is still uncovered.\r\nIn 1920, though it may be estimated that the total women membership\r\nof Trade Unions is nearly three-quarters of a million, this still\r\nrepresents less than 30 per cent of the adult women wage-earners.\r\n\r\nThe outstanding feature in women’s Trade Unionism during the past\r\ndecade has been its advance, not merely in numbers and achievements,\r\nbut also in status and influence. This has come with accelerating\r\nspeed. To the first Treasury Conference in 1915, at which the\r\nGovernment sought the help of the Trade Unions in the winning of the\r\nwar, it apparently did not occur to any official to invite the National\r\nFederation of Women Workers; but in all subsequent proceedings of the\r\nsame nature Miss Mary Macarthur and Miss Susan Lawrence, on behalf\r\nof the women Trade Unionists in this and other societies, occupied\r\na leading position. Whether before the Munitions Act Tribunals, the\r\nCommittee on Production, or the Special Arbitration Tribunal set up\r\nby the Government to deal with the conditions of employment of women\r\nmunition-workers, the women’s case, whether put by the representatives\r\nof the Women’s Unions, or by those of the principal Unions of general\r\nworkers that included women, was so ably conducted as to secure for\r\nthe women workers, almost for the first time, something like the\r\nsame measure of justice as that which the men had wrested from the\r\nemployers for themselves. The result was not only a marked rise in\r\nthe standard of remuneration for women, the opening up to them of\r\nmany fields of work from which they had hitherto been excluded, and a\r\ngeneral improvement in their conditions of employment, but also a rapid\r\ndevelopment of Trade Unionism among them--nine-tenths of the women\r\nTrade Unionists being in societies enrolling both men and women--and\r\nthe winning, for women’s Trade Unions, of the respect of the Trade\r\nUnion world. For the first time a woman was elected in 1919 by the\r\nTrades Union Congress to its Parliamentary Committee, Miss Margaret\r\nBondfield, of the National Federation of Women Workers, receiving over\r\nthree million votes. On the reconstitution in 1918 of the Labour Party,\r\nin which women had always been accorded equal rights, provision was\r\nmade so that there should always be at least four women elected to the\r\nExecutive Committee. A Standing Joint Committee of Women’s Industrial\r\nOrganisations, established in 1916, now initiates and co-ordinates the\r\naction of the principal women’s Trade Unions, the Women’s Co-operative\r\nGuild (which organises the women of the Co-operative movement), the\r\nRailway Women’s Guild, composed of the wives of railwaymen, and the\r\nWomen’s Labour League, now the women’s section of the Labour Party\r\nitself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL WORKERS\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the leaders of the skilled craftsmen and better-paid workmen\r\nwere inclined to believe that effective or durable Trade Unionism\r\namong the general labourers and unskilled or nondescript workmen was\r\nas impracticable as it had hitherto proved to be among the mass of\r\nwomen wage-earners. The outburst of Trade Unionism among the dockers\r\nand gasworkers in 1888-89 was commonly expected to be as transient as\r\nanalogous movements had been in 1834 and 1871. In 1920 we find the\r\norganisations of this despised section, some of them of over thirty\r\nyears’ standing, accounting for no less than 30 per cent of the\r\nwhole Trade Union membership, and their leaders--notably Mr. Clynes,\r\nMr. Thorne, and Mr. Robert Williams--exercising at least their full\r\nshare of influence in the counsels of the Trade Union Movement as a\r\nwhole. For a few years after 1889, indeed, the aggregate membership\r\nof the newly-formed labourers’ Unions declined, and some of the\r\nweaker ones collapsed, or became merged in the larger societies. But\r\nthe Gas-workers’ and General Labourers’ Union (established 1889),\r\nwhich changed its name in 1918 to the National Union of General\r\nWorkers; and the Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Workers’ Union\r\n(established 1887) maintained themselves in existence; and already in\r\n1907 there were as many as 150,000 organised labourers in half-a-dozen\r\nwell-established societies. The outburst of Trade Unionism among\r\nthe farm labourers in 1890 gradually faded away. But in 1906 a new\r\nsociety, the National Agricultural Labourers and Rural Workers’ Trade\r\nUnion, was formed, which at once made headway in Norfolk and the\r\nadjacent counties; to be followed in 1913 by the energetic Scottish\r\nFarm Servants’ Trade Union. Organisation was, between 1904 and 1911,\r\nsteadily extending in all directions, when the passing of the National\r\nInsurance Act, which practically compelled every wage-earner to join an\r\n“Approved Society” of some kind, led to a dramatic expansion of Trade\r\nUnion membership, from which the various Unions of general workers,\r\nas they now prefer to be styled, obtained their share of advantage.\r\nThe Workers’ Union, in particular, which had been established in 1898,\r\nfor the enrolment of members among the nondescript and semi-skilled\r\nworkers of all sorts not catered for by the craft Unions, had, after\r\ntwelve years’ existence, only 5000 members in 111 branches in 1910,\r\nbut grew during 1911-13 to 91,000 members in 567 branches. In three\r\nyears more it stood at 197,000 members in 750 branches, and by the\r\nend of 1919 its membership had risen to about 500,000 in nearly 2000\r\nbranches, comprising almost every kind and grade of worker, of any\r\nage and either sex, from clay-workers and tin miners to corporation\r\nemployees and sanitary inspectors, from domestic servants and waiters\r\nto farm labourers and carmen, and every kind of nondescript worker in\r\nthe factory, the yard, or on the road. The organising of the rural\r\nlabourers has been shared by nearly all the principal Unions of\r\nGeneral Workers. The passing of the Corn Production Act in 1917, with\r\nits incidental establishment of Joint Boards in every county of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, empowered to fix a legal minimum wage for a prescribed\r\nnormal working day, had the result of greatly extending Trade Union\r\nmembership among all sections of agricultural labourers, who are now\r\n(1920), for the first time in history, more or less organised in every\r\ncounty of Great Britain--partly in the very successful Agricultural\r\nLabourers’ Union, which had, at the end of 1919, 180,000 members in no\r\nfewer than 2700 branches; partly in the Workers’ Union, which has a\r\nlarge number of agricultural branches; partly in the National Union of\r\nGeneral Workers, the Dock, Wharf and Riverside Labourers’ Union, and\r\nthe National Amalgamated Union of Labour; in all the Scottish counties,\r\nin the powerful Scottish Farm Servants’ Union; whilst in Ireland the\r\nagricultural wage-earners have been enrolled in the Transport and\r\nGeneral Workers’ Union. The total number of agricultural labourers\r\nin Trade Unions in 1920 probably reaches more than three hundred\r\nthousand, being about one-third of the total number of men employed in\r\nagriculture at wages.\r\n\r\nThroughout the years of war the membership of the various Unions\r\nclassified under the head of Transport and General Labour (including\r\nthe dockers and seamen), which in 1892 was only 154,000, continued to\r\nincrease by leaps and bounds until, in 1920, their aggregate membership\r\nconsiderably exceeds that of the entire Trade Union world of 1890, and\r\ndoes not fall far short of a couple of millions.\r\n\r\nOf recent years there has been a steady pressure towards amalgamation\r\nand consolidation of forces. Many small and local Unions have been\r\nmerged, and several of the larger bodies seem to be on the point of\r\nunion. Meanwhile the movement towards closer federation is strong.\r\nIn 1908 all the big general Labour Unions became associated in the\r\nGeneral Labourers’ National Council, a useful consultative body,\r\nhaving for its principal function the prevention of overlapping and\r\nconflict among the different Unions. It was successful in arranging for\r\nfreedom of transfer and mutual recognition of each other’s membership\r\namong its constituent Unions, and in promoting a certain amount of\r\ndemarcation of spheres, and even of amalgamation. This Council in May\r\n1917 developed into a National Federation of General Workers, which\r\nincludes eleven important general Unions of General Workers, having an\r\naggregate membership of over 800,000. This important federation took a\r\nsignificant step towards unification in November 1919, in appointing\r\nten District Committees, consisting of two representatives of each of\r\nthe affiliated societies, charged to consult with regard to any local\r\ntrade dispute involving more than one society.\r\n\r\nRecent years have seen the rise of a new grouping. The several Unions\r\nof seamen, lightermen, dock and wharf labourers, coal-porters and\r\ncarmen have asserted themselves as Transport Workers, seeking not\r\nmerely to take common action in matters of wages and hours, but also\r\nto formulate regulations for the government of the whole industry of\r\ntransport (apart from that of railways), which is one more example of\r\nthe tendency to create “industrial” federations on a national basis.\r\nThe organisation for the purpose is the National Transport Workers’\r\nFederation, comprising three dozen of the Unions having among their\r\nmembers men engaged in waterside transport work, including seamen,\r\ndockers, and carters. It was formed in November 1910 at the instance\r\nof the Dockers’ Union, and came at once into prominence during the\r\nLondon strike of 1911, which it handled with great vigour.[609] This\r\nwas the first great fight in the Port of London since the upheaval\r\nof 1889. The National Union of Sailors and Firemen, which had in\r\nvain appealed to the Shipping Federation to unite in constituting a\r\nConciliation Board, in June 1911 struck for a uniform scale at all\r\nports and various minor ameliorations of their conditions. Largely\r\nas a result of the excitement caused by the seamen’s strike, the\r\ndockers in July came out for a rise from 6d. to 8d. per hour, with 1s.\r\nper hour for overtime. The stevedores, the gasworkers, the carmen,\r\nthe coal-porters, the tug-enginemen, the grain porters, and various\r\nother bodies of men engaged in or about the port, put forward their\r\nown claims. Amid great excitement the whole port was stopped, great\r\nmeetings on Tower Hill were held daily, and processions of strikers,\r\nsaid to have been as many as 100,000 in number, paraded through the\r\nCity. The unrest spread to most other ports, and there were some local\r\ndisturbances. The Port of London Authority, under Lord Devonport,\r\nrefused all parley, and the Government for some time practically\r\nsupported this great corporate employer, which had failed (and has to\r\nthis day failed) to comply with the section of the Act of Parliament\r\nby which it was constituted directing it to institute a scheme for\r\nmore civilised conditions of employment for its labourers. The War\r\nOffice, at the request of Mr. Winston Churchill, who was then at the\r\nHome Office, accumulated troops in London, and actually threatened to\r\nput 25,000 soldiers to break the strike by doing the dockers’ work--a\r\nstep which would undoubtedly have led to bloody conflict in the\r\nstreets. Finally, however, the Cabinet gave way, and persuaded Lord\r\nDevonport and his colleagues, together with shipowners, wharfingers,\r\nand granary proprietors, to meet the representatives of the Unions\r\nwith a view to agreement. For three whole days they sat and argued,\r\nultimately arriving at an agreement under which the men returned to\r\nwork on the immediate concession of about half their demand and the\r\nremission of the other half to arbitration. This was undertaken by Sir\r\nAlbert Rollit, M.P., at the instance of the London Chamber of Commerce,\r\nhis award eventually conceding to the men substantially their whole\r\nclaim; summed up in 8d. per hour for the dockers, with 1s. per hour\r\nfor overtime, other trades, and the men at other ports, obtaining, in\r\none or other form, analogous advantages.[610] In May 1912 the dispute\r\nflared up again in the Thames and Medway, when a combined strike\r\nand lock-out, in which 80,000 men were involved, stopped the work of\r\nthe port for six weeks. Sympathetic strikes in other ports led to\r\nsome 20,000 men being idle for a few days. The men asserted that the\r\nemployers had not in all cases fulfilled the agreement of the previous\r\nyear, and were discriminating against Trade Unionists. The employers\r\nseem to have been concerned, in the main, to avoid recognition of the\r\nTransport Workers’ Federation, and to check its growing authority. In\r\nspite of the vigorous support of the _Daily Herald_; of pecuniary help,\r\nnot only from Australia and the United States, but also from the German\r\nTrade Unions; and of the mediation of the Government, the strike failed\r\nowing to the men breaking away, and to the stubborn obstinacy of Lord\r\nDevonport, as Chairman of the Port of London Authority, who insisted\r\non a resumption of work upon the employers’ assurance that they would\r\nrespect all agreements and consider any grievances put forward by the\r\nrepresentatives of any section. Notwithstanding the failure of this\r\nsomewhat premature effort of the Transport Workers’ Federation, its\r\nformation, together with that of the National Federation of General\r\nWorkers, have gone far to transform the position. For a couple of\r\ndecades the efforts of the General Labourers’ Unions took the form of\r\ninnumerable local and sectional demands, not merely for higher rates\r\nof pay, though advances of several shillings per week have continually\r\nbeen secured, but for mutual agreement of piecework rates, a reduction\r\nof working hours, insistence on compensation for accidents, the\r\nprovision of better accommodation or greater amenity in work, and extra\r\nallowances for tasks of peculiar strain or discomfort. The efforts of\r\nthe federations have raised these local and sectional arrangements\r\nto the level of national questions; and the agreements now concluded\r\nwith the employers’ national representatives amount to an increasingly\r\neffective control over the industry.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE “BLACK-COATED PROLETARIAT”\r\n\r\nIf Trade Unionism has, in the past thirty years, successfully\r\nprogressed downward to the women and the unskilled labourers, its\r\nadvance, in a sense upwards, among the various sections of the\r\n“black-coated proletariat,” has been no less remarkable. In 1892\r\nthere were only the smallest signs of Trade Union organisation among\r\nthe clerks and shop assistants, the various sections of Post Office\r\nand other Government employees, the municipal officers, and the life\r\nassurance agents. Among wage-earners in these various occupations,\r\nnumbering in the United Kingdom possibly several millions--badly paid,\r\nworking under unsatisfactory conditions, and sometimes subject to\r\nactual tyranny--there were, thirty years ago, a few dozen small and\r\nstruggling Trade Unions, with only a few tens of thousands of aggregate\r\nmembership. In 1920 these have developed into powerful amalgamations\r\nin most of the several sections, nearly all fully recognised by their\r\nemployers, whether private or public, with whom they enter into\r\ncollective agreements; and enrolling a total membership falling not far\r\nshort of three-quarters of a million.\r\n\r\nWe may note first the army of shop assistants, warehousemen, and other\r\nemployees in the distributive trades, wholesale and retail.[611]\r\nThe National Amalgamated Union of Shop Assistants, Warehousemen,\r\nand Clerks, established in 1891, made at first slow progress, and\r\ncounted in 1912, after a couple of decades of growth, fewer than\r\n65,000 members. Partly as a result of the National Insurance Act,\r\nwhich practically compelled all employees under £160 to join some\r\norganisation, the Union went ahead by leaps and bounds, multiplying\r\nits branches and swelling its numbers, until it counts now over\r\n100,000 members. Meanwhile the Amalgamated Union of Co-operative\r\nEmployees (also established in 1891)--in 1918 adding to its title also\r\n“Commercial Employees and Allied Workers”--has benefited by a similar\r\nexpansion, counting, in 1920, also about 100,000 members. This society\r\nstarted on the basis of enrolling all employees of the Co-operative\r\nSocieties, whatever their crafts, and no other persons, a constitution\r\nnow disapproved of by the Trades Union Congress. It is, however, not\r\nnow confined to persons employed by co-operative societies; and whilst\r\nit includes a number of carmen, tailors, bakers, bootmakers, and\r\nothers in co-operative employment who should more appropriately belong\r\nto other Unions, the negotiations that have been for some time in\r\nprogress for the merging of both organisations in a single great Union\r\nof persons employed in the distributive trades, and the transfer of\r\nthose belonging to specific crafts to their own societies, may probably\r\npresently be successful.\r\n\r\nOf clerks, the most effective organisation is that of the clerical\r\nservice of the railway companies, the Railway Clerks’ Association,\r\nwhich takes in also stationmasters, inspectors, and ticket-collectors\r\n(who are all eligible also for the National Union of Railwaymen, which\r\nsome of them have joined). Established in 1897, it continued for a\r\ndecade insignificant in magnitude, and had not by 1910 enrolled as many\r\nas 10,000 members. After the railway strike of 1911 it began to forge\r\nahead, passing from 30,000 in 1914 to 42,000 in 1915--a total doubled\r\nby 1920, and with increasing strength it obtained gradually increasing\r\nrecognition from the railway companies, successfully maintaining its\r\nright to enrol, not only clerks in the General Managers’ offices, but\r\nalso inspectors and stationmasters. As its membership grew, it was\r\nable successfully to contest the elections for representatives on\r\nthe committees of the various superannuation funds instituted by the\r\ncompanies, and thereby to demonstrate its right to speak for the whole\r\nbody of railway clerks. Whilst acting in friendly association with\r\nthe National Union of Railwaymen, the Railway Clerks’ Association\r\nhas latterly drawn to itself an ever-increasing proportion of the\r\ninspectors and stationmasters; and in 1920, when it can count on a\r\nmembership of nearly 90,000, it is claiming to speak for all grades\r\nof the Railway Clerical Administrative and Supervisory Staff. Since\r\n1913, at least, it has been asserting a claim, as soon as the railways\r\nare nationalised, to some participation in their management; and\r\nat the end of 1919, it is understood, some promise was made by the\r\nMinister of Transport that, in any Railway Board or National Advisory\r\nCommittee that may be constituted, the Railway Clerks’ Association\r\nwould, with the National Union of Railwaymen and the Associated Society\r\nof Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, be accorded its due share of\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThe great army of clerks in commercial offices has made less progress\r\nin organisation than the shop assistants and the railway clerks. For\r\nyears, indeed, it seemed as if commercial clerks would not form a Trade\r\nUnion; and the National Union of Clerks (established 1890) made little\r\nheadway. In 1912 it had still under 9000 members. In the past seven\r\nyears it has bounded up to 55,000 members.[612] There is also a small\r\nIrish Clerical Workers’ Union, principally in Dublin, resulting from a\r\nsecession from the National Union. Most remarkable of all has been the\r\nformation, during the war, of a Bank Officers’ Guild and an Irish Bank\r\nOfficials’ Association, having definitely Trade Union objects (though\r\nnot yet seeking to join the Trades Union Congress), both of them being\r\nindependent of the Bankers’ Institute, which retains the character of\r\na scientific and educational society. There is now even a Guild of Law\r\nCourt Officials, having definitely Trade Union objects.\r\n\r\nThe great body of teachers of all kinds and grades, numbering\r\naltogether about 300,000 men and women in the United Kingdom, have,\r\nduring the past thirty years, become strongly and very elaborately\r\norganised in many different societies.[613] What is significant is\r\nthe extent to which many of these professional associations have\r\nlatterly adopted the purposes, and even the characteristic methods,\r\nof Trade Unionism. The largest of these bodies, the National Union\r\nof Teachers, established in 1890, has now over 102,000 members, and\r\nexercises great influence upon the conditions of employment of the\r\nteachers in elementary schools. During the past few years it has\r\nsupported various district or county strikes for better salary-scales.\r\nThe teachers in secondary schools are organised in four societies,\r\nfor headmasters, headmistresses, assistant masters, and assistant\r\nmistresses respectively, united in a Federal Council of Secondary\r\nSchool Associations, which, though it has not yet fomented or supported\r\na strike, has of late organised effective pressure to obtain greater\r\nsecurity of tenure for assistants, better salary-scales, and a\r\nuniversal superannuation scheme.\r\n\r\nEqually significant is the recent development of organisation\r\namong the industrial technicians, whether engineers, electricians,\r\nchemists, or merely foremen and managers; among the workers in\r\nscientific laboratories, whether for research, medical, teaching,\r\nor administrative purposes; and among the junior lecturers and\r\nassistants at University institutions. These organisations overlap\r\nin their spheres, if not also in their memberships, and are not yet\r\nstabilised, but most of them are united in the National Federation of\r\nProfessional Workers of even wider scope. What is important is the\r\ngrowing divergence between what are essentially Trade Unions of the\r\nbrain-working professionals and the purely “scientific societies” to\r\nwhich such persons have, until recent years, restricted their tendency\r\nto professional association. Some of the new bodies (such as the\r\nSociety of Technical Engineers) have actually registered themselves\r\nas Trade Unions, a step taken also by the Medico-Political Union, a\r\nvigorous association of medical practitioners; whilst the newly formed\r\nActors’ Association, like the National Union of Journalists, has\r\napplied for affiliation to the Trades Union Congress.\r\n\r\nThe life assurance agents--principally those employed in “industrial”\r\ninsurance--number 100,000, and they have become organised in a score\r\nof societies, restricted to the staffs of particular companies. These\r\norganisations vary in their nature and in their degree of independence,\r\nfrom mere “welfare societies,” dominated by the management, up to\r\naggressive Trade Unions--the strongest being the National Association\r\nof Prudential Assurance Agents. They are mostly united in two different\r\nfederations. Another, and perhaps wholesomer, basis of organisation is\r\nadopted by the National Union of Life Assurance Agents, which has now\r\nsome thousands of members.\r\n\r\nBut the greatest development of Trade Unionism among the “black-coated\r\nproletariat” has been among the employees of the National and Local\r\nGovernment. This has been entirely a growth of the past thirty years.\r\nBeginning among the manual working staff of the Postmaster-General,\r\nand among the artisans and labourers of the Government dockyards,\r\narsenals, and other manufacturing departments, there are now a hundred\r\nand seventy separate Trade Unions of State employees, from the crews\r\nof the Customs launches and the boy clerks, up to the Admiralty\r\nConstructive Engineers and the Superintendents of Mercantile Marine\r\nOffices. Of recent years, organisation has spread to the higher grades\r\nof the Civil Service, even to the “Class I.” clerks; and practically\r\nno one below the rank of an Under-Secretary of State is held to be\r\noutside the scope of the Society of Civil Servants. All the various\r\nsocieties are grouped in federations, from the “Waterguard Federation”\r\nand the Prison Officers’ Federation of the United Kingdom; through\r\nthe United Government Workers’ Federation and the Federal Council of\r\nGovernment Employees, combining the various kinds of manual working\r\noperatives; up to the Customs and Excise Federation, the Civil\r\nService Federation, the Civil Service Alliance, and even the “National\r\nFederation of Professional Workers,” which includes also teachers. The\r\nstrongest of all these bodies is probably that of the various employees\r\nof the Postmaster-General, whose fight to secure “recognition” and the\r\nopportunity for “Collective Bargaining” has extended over a couple\r\nof decades. There are about fifty separate Unions of Post Office\r\nemployees, mostly small and sectional bodies; but the three principal\r\nsocieties (the Postal and Telegraph Clerks’ Association, the Postmen’s\r\nFederation, and the Fawcett Association) were amalgamated in 1919\r\ninto one powerful Union of Post Office Workers, with 90,000 members\r\nwith eleven salaried officers, and affiliated both to the Trades\r\nUnion Congress and the Labour Party, which can now meet the managing\r\nofficials of the Post Office on something like equal terms.\r\n\r\nThe employees of the Local Authorities--thirty years ago entirely\r\nwithout organisation--are still not so well combined as those of the\r\nNational Government. A score of different societies, from such grades\r\nas school-keepers, police and prison officers and asylum attendants,\r\nup to municipal clerks, share the work with the National Union of\r\nCorporation Workers and the Municipal Employees’ Association. A large\r\nproportion of the wage-earners employed by Local Authorities are to\r\nbe found in the Unions of General Workers. The National Association\r\nof Local Government Officers and Clerks is a large and powerful body,\r\ncomposed mainly of the clerical and supervisory grades.\r\n\r\nTrade Unionism in the public service received a great fillip after\r\n1906, when Mr. Herbert Samuel at the Post Office, together with\r\nsome other Ministers, “recognised” the Unions of their employees,\r\nconsidered their corporate representations, and agreed to meet their\r\nofficials. It was still further promoted when, in 1912, the Government\r\nconsented to the establishment of an independent Arbitration Tribunal\r\nfor determining the terms of employment in the Civil Service for\r\nall grades and sections under £500 a year. Before this tribunal,\r\nwhose awards were definitively authoritative, the representatives of\r\nany association could appear as plaintiffs, those of the Treasury\r\nappearing always as defendants. Finally, after the promulgation in\r\n1917 of the “Whitley Report,” which the Government, in impressing\r\non other employers, found itself constrained to adopt in its own\r\nestablishments, there was established during 1919 an elaborate series\r\nof joint councils (including even the civil departments of the War\r\nOffice and the Admiralty) for particular branches of establishments;\r\nfor whole departments, and for whole grades of the service throughout\r\nall departments, in which equal numbers of persons nominated by the\r\nemployees’ associations, and of superior officers chosen by the\r\nGovernment, representing the management, meet periodically to discuss\r\non equal terms questions of office organisation, professional training,\r\nconditions of service, methods of promotion, and what not.[614]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MINERS\r\n\r\nThe outstanding feature of the Trade Union world between 1890 and\r\n1920 has been the growing predominance, in its counsels and in its\r\ncollective activity, of the organised forces of the coal-miners.\r\nRight down to 1888, as we have seen, the coal-miners of England,\r\nScotland, and Wales, though sporadically forming local associations\r\nand now and again engaging in fierce conflicts with their employers,\r\nfirst in this coalfield and then in that, had failed to maintain\r\nany organisation of national scope. Though their representatives\r\nparticipated from time to time in the general activities of the Trade\r\nUnion Movement, and sat in the Trades Union Congress; though with the\r\nguidance of W. P. Roberts in the ’forties, and under the successive\r\nleadership of Alexander Macdonald and Thomas Burt in the ’sixties and\r\n’seventies, they exercised intermittently a considerable influence\r\non its Parliamentary action--the miners, for the most part, kept to\r\nthemselves, framed their own policy, and fought their own battles, in\r\nwhich, owing to an apparently incurable “localism,” their success was\r\nnot commensurate with their strength. The change came with the growing\r\ndissatisfaction with the policy of the Sliding Scale. This device for\r\nmaking the rate of wages vary in proportion to the selling price of\r\ncoal, the adoption of which between 1874 and 1880--against the wish\r\nof Alexander Macdonald, and contrary to the advice of such friends as\r\nProfessor Beesly and Lloyd Jones--we have already described, produced\r\nin the ’eighties an ever-increasing discontent. In 1881 the miners of\r\nYorkshire merged their two Unions of South and West Yorkshire into the\r\nYorkshire Miners’ Association, which began its successful career by\r\nterminating the local Sliding Scale agreement, and resolutely refused\r\nall future attempts to make wages depend on selling prices. The\r\nLancashire and Cheshire Miners’ Federation, a less well-organised body,\r\npresently followed its example. In 1885 a Midland Federation was formed\r\nby a number of smaller local associations for the purpose both of\r\nabolishing the Sliding Scale and of promoting the movement for an Eight\r\nHours Day by legislative enactment. Three years later, at a conference\r\nat Manchester, the associations of Yorkshire, Lancashire and Cheshire,\r\nthe Midlands, and Fifeshire, with a nascent local organisation in\r\nSouth Wales, established the Miners’ Federation of Great Britain.[615]\r\nThe aggregate membership of all these bodies was amazingly small--at\r\nthe start only 36,000--but the new Federation had, from the first, a\r\ndefinite policy and great driving force. Outside it there remained\r\nthe solid and numerically strong Durham Miners’ Association and the\r\nNorthumberland Miners’ Mutual Confident Association, which (together\r\nwith a surviving remnant of the Amalgamated Association in South\r\nStaffordshire, and the purely nominal Sliding Scale Associations which\r\nthen characterised most of the South Wales coalfield) still clung\r\ntogether as the National Union. It was the National Union which played\r\nthe leading part in securing reforms in the Coal Mines Regulation Act\r\nof 1887, which firmly established the checkweigher in practically\r\nevery colliery of any importance. But this was its last constructive\r\neffort. Its subsequent history is little more than the long-drawn-out\r\nresistance of the able and respected leaders of the Northumberland and\r\nDurham miners to the new ideas of Labour policy which were, as we have\r\ndescribed, becoming dominant in the Trades Union Congress, and which\r\nwere from the first adopted, if not by all the leaders, at least by the\r\nsuccessive delegate conferences of the Miners’ Federation.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of the Federation coincided with a period of rapid\r\nexpansion in the coal-mining industry. The number of persons employed\r\nrose considerably year after year, and Trade Unionism spread rapidly\r\namong them. An effective local organisation was built up in district\r\nafter district, everywhere based on the autonomy in local concerns of\r\nthe “lodge” or branch, consisting of the workers at a given colliery,\r\nand governed by mass meetings of the members, who elect a committee,\r\nwhich usually meets at least weekly. But although the National Union\r\ndeclined steadily in influence, it took twenty years to bring all\r\nthe district associations into the Miners’ Federation, the aggregate\r\nmembership of which did not reach 200,000 until 1893, and seven years\r\nlater was still only 363,000. Even so, the miners were, as we described\r\nthem in 1892, in some ways the most effectively organised of the\r\nindustrial groups into which we divided the Trade Union world of that\r\ndate. With the adhesion of Northumberland and Durham in 1908, when the\r\nNational Union came finally to an end, the membership of the Federation\r\nrose to nearly 600,000, whilst the next twelve years’ growth of the\r\nindustry, and the inclusion of a large proportion of the sectional\r\nunions among different grades of mine-workers,[616] have brought it in\r\n1920 to nearly 900,000.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile issue was joined by the mine-owners, who insisted everywhere\r\nin 1893 on considerable reductions in the wage-rates, on the plea that\r\nselling prices had fallen. The great strike that followed involved\r\n400,000 men, and lasted from July to November. In the end the men\r\nhad to submit to reductions, though they gained the important point\r\nof the practical though not explicit recognition of a minimum below\r\nwhich there was to be no fall. The next great achievement of the\r\nFederation was the carrying into law of the Eight Hours Bill, which,\r\nmainly owing to the opposition of the leaders of the Northumberland and\r\nDurham Miners, was not accomplished until 1908; and their influence\r\nin improving the Mines Regulation Act of 1911. Their third success,\r\nthe outcome of a decade of successful organisation and intellectual\r\nleadership by Mr. Robert Smillie, who since 1912 has been annually\r\nelected to the presidency, was attained only at the cost of the\r\ngreatest industrial struggle that Great Britain had yet experienced.\r\n\r\nThe national strike of miners in 1912, when practically every mine\r\nwas stopped, and nearly a million miners suspended work for more\r\nthan a month, arose out of the failure of the colliery companies to\r\nmake adequate provision for repeated cases of individual hardship\r\nand injustice. The piecework rates of the hewers or getters of coal\r\nmight be satisfactorily adjusted to the agreed day-wage standard of\r\nthe district, though the arrangements for this adjustment vary from\r\ndistrict to district, and even from mine to mine, and are very far\r\nfrom complete or satisfactory. But what was to happen when, from\r\ncircumstances beyond his own control, the miner found himself unable\r\nto get enough coal to produce a subsistence wage? If he is assigned\r\nan “abnormal place”--where the seam is thin or crushed into small\r\ncoal (for which, in South Wales, the hewer is not paid at all); or\r\nwhere exceptional timbering is required to prevent dangerous falls;\r\nor where there is much “stone” or water: or if, in “normal places,”\r\nthe colliery management does not keep him regularly supplied with\r\n“trams” or “tubs” into which to load the coal; or with a sufficient\r\nprovision of timber for props and sleepers; or of rails--no amount of\r\nskill, strength, or assiduity will prevent his earnings from falling\r\naway, it may be to next to nothing. What had long been customary\r\nwas, in some coalfields, the casting of lots for “places,” and thus\r\na periodical exchange of opportunities; and in others the granting\r\nof an allowance, or “consideration,” to hewers who complained of\r\ninsufficient earnings. These allowances were granted irregularly,\r\nwithout the protection of Collective Bargaining, with insufficient\r\nprovision for ensuring the avoidance of injustice; and it is not now\r\ndenied that, in some collieries, particularly in South Wales, the\r\nowners resorted to the simple expedient of restricting the manager to a\r\nfixed maximum sum each “measuring-up day,” irrespective of the number\r\nand extent of the men’s reasonable claims. These sums, moreover, were\r\nmuch reduced in times of bad trade, when profits were at a minimum,\r\nespecially in collieries which were actually working at a loss. The\r\nagitation for securing a prescribed minimum of daily earnings for all\r\nthe piece-workers continued for a whole decade without much result,\r\nproducing not a few local stoppages, especially in South Wales. These\r\nflared up, in the latter part of 1910, in the Aberdare and Rhondda\r\nvalleys, into an almost continuous series of disputes. The Miners’\r\nFederation found itself compelled in July 1911 to take the matter up\r\nas a national question; and a ballot of its whole membership decided\r\nfor a national strike if the universal adoption of the principle of a\r\nprescribed daily minimum, not merely for hewers but for all grades, was\r\nnot conceded. The owners quibbled and eventually refused; and after a\r\nfurther ballot a national strike was decided on, which the Government\r\nnegotiations failed to avert, and which, after long and repeated\r\nnotice, began at the end of February 1912, and rapidly extended to\r\npractically every colliery in the kingdom. As neither the employers nor\r\nthe workmen would give way, the Government then announced its intention\r\nof introducing a Bill to provide for the payment, to all underground\r\nworkers in the mine, not of the prescribed minimum rates which the\r\nseveral districts had formulated, nor yet of the overriding national\r\nminima of 5s. for a man and 2s. for a boy which were being demanded,\r\nbut of district minima, to be prescribed in each coalfield by a Joint\r\nBoard of employers and workmen, presided over by an impartial chairman.\r\nThese provisions were bitterly opposed, not only by the coal-owners,\r\nwho objected to any legal minimum, but also by the workmen’s\r\nrepresentatives in the House of Commons, who demanded a prescribed\r\nnational minimum; but they were carried into law by substantial\r\nmajorities. The Federation Executive was perplexed as to the line to\r\ntake, as half the membership wanted to carry on the struggle; but it\r\nwas eventually decided to give the Act and the Joint Boards a chance,\r\nand the strike was declared at an end. The district minima and the\r\nrules applicable thereto had, in most cases, to be decided by the\r\nimpartial chairmen; and they varied considerably from district to\r\ndistrict, being usually a little less than the workmen had claimed. But\r\nwhen the working of the system was understood, and it was got smoothly\r\ninto operation, it was recognised that the Miners’ Federation had\r\nachieved a very substantial victory. The miners had brought to their\r\naid, in enforcing the payment of a periodically prescribed Minimum\r\nDay Wage to all underground workers, the strong arm of the law--not,\r\nit is true, as under the Mines Regulation Acts and the Factory and\r\nWorkshop Acts, the criminal law, enforced by Government inspectors\r\nand prosecutions, but the civil law of contract, which they could\r\nthemselves enforce by actions in the County Court. What the Federation\r\nextorted from the Government and the Legislature was “an extraordinary\r\npiece of hastily prepared legislation rushed through Parliament in\r\nthe shadow of an unprecedented national calamity.”[617] It has been\r\nfound by experience that this Act, which is nominally only temporary,\r\ndoes secure to the hewers a substantial minimum of day wages, however\r\nunremunerative their conditions of work; and the fixing of rates by the\r\nJoint Boards has, on the whole, considerably increased the wages of the\r\nvarious grades of the less skilled workers. But more important than\r\nthese immediate results was the demonstration and the consolidation of\r\nthe national strength of the Miners’ Federation itself; and the respect\r\nwhich its great power henceforth secured for it, alike in the Trade\r\nUnion Movement, with the employers, and at the hands of the Government\r\nand the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nThe miners’ organisations were fully occupied for a year or two\r\nin putting into operation the Act of 1912, and in enforcing the\r\ndeterminations of the Joint Boards. But in 1913 the delegate conference\r\nmade a new move in authorising the Executive Committee to enter into\r\nrelations with other Trade Unions with a view to joint action for\r\nmutual assistance. A formal alliance had been made between the Miners’\r\nFederation, the National Union of Railwaymen, and the Transport\r\nWorkers’ Federation--commonly referred to as the Triple Alliance--when\r\neverything was suddenly changed by the breaking out of the Great War.\r\nThe 1500 colliery companies and individual colliery owners, most of\r\nwhom are united in the Mining Association of Great Britain, as well as\r\nin district associations, have, throughout, steadfastly refused to meet\r\nthe Miners’ Federation for the negotiation of any national agreement,\r\nor the concession of national advances; although there has long been\r\nelaborate machinery for negotiation in each district.\r\n\r\nDuring the four and a quarter years that the world conflict lasted\r\n(1914-18), the miners, like the rest of the British working class,\r\npatriotically subordinated their interests to those of the nation as\r\na whole. They volunteered for military service in such numbers that\r\nthey had to be forbidden to leave the mines, and numbers of them were\r\nsent back from the armies in order to maintain the output of coal.\r\nWhere, as in Durham, they had agreements securing them advances of\r\nwages in proportion to the rise in the selling price, they forewent\r\nthese advances; and they contented themselves everywhere with less\r\nsubstantial percentages of rise in rates, and with the two successive\r\nwar bonuses of eighteen pence a day each--much below the rise in the\r\ncost of living--which the Government accorded to them in 1917 and 1918.\r\nWith the cessation of hostilities at the end of 1918, as the cost of\r\nliving continued to advance, the Miners’ Federation (which had elected\r\nfor its new secretary a young South Wales miner, Mr. Frank Hodges,\r\nwho had educated himself at Labour Colleges; and had also converted\r\nits presidency into a full-time salaried post, and for the first time\r\nacquired an office in London) again took up the forward movement\r\nwhich it had been concerting five years before; and in February 1919,\r\nafter balloting its whole membership, and giving elaborate notice,\r\nit demanded from the employers a general advance of wages of 30 per\r\ncent, the reduction of the hours of labour by an average of one-fourth\r\n(the nominal Eight Hours Day to be made a nominal Six Hours Day),\r\nand--most momentous of all--the elimination of the profit-making\r\ncapitalist from the industry by the Nationalisation of the Mines,\r\nfor which the Trades Union Congress had been vainly asking for over\r\ntwenty years. As the railwaymen and the transport workers were at the\r\nsame time in negotiation for improvements in their condition, there\r\nseemed, in March 1919, every prospect of the outbreak of a general\r\nstrike on a scale even greater than that of 1912, the “Triple Alliance”\r\nuniting a membership of more than a million and a half, and wielding\r\nin combination the adult male labour of something like one-sixth of\r\nthe whole nation. The Government, which was still, under war powers,\r\ndirecting both the mines and the railways, responded by the offer\r\nof a Statutory Commission, under a Judge of the High Court, with\r\npractically unlimited powers of investigation and recommendation; at\r\nthe same time giving the Federation publicly to understand that, whilst\r\na strike would be suppressed with all the powers of the State, the\r\nrecommendations of the Commission would be accepted by the Cabinet. The\r\nconference of the Miners’ Federation spent many hours in deliberation.\r\nA large section of the delegates was for an immediate strike. The men\r\nhad, indeed, an extraordinarily advantageous strategic position. The\r\nnation’s stocks of coal were at a minimum, London having only three\r\ndays’ supply in hand. Ultimately the advice of the leaders prevailed;\r\nand it was decided to postpone the withdrawal of labour for three\r\nweeks, and to take part in the Statutory Commission, on the express\r\ncondition that this body presented an Interim Report within that time;\r\nand--most revolutionary of all--that the Federation should be allowed\r\nto nominate to the Commission, not only three of its own members to\r\nbalance the three coal-owners who had been informally designated by\r\nthe Mining Association of Great Britain, but also three out of the\r\nsix professedly disinterested members, so as to balance the three\r\ncapitalists whom the Government had already chosen as representing the\r\nprincipal industries dependent on the supply of coal at a moderate\r\nprice. To these terms the Prime Minister acceded. The Miners’\r\nFederation, setting a new precedent of far-reaching effect, thereupon\r\nnominated, along with its President, Vice-president, and Secretary, not\r\nthree other workmen, but three economists and statisticians belonging\r\nto the Fabian Society, known to them by their lectures and writings.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings of this Commission, which sat daily in public in the\r\nKing’s Robing-Room at the House of Lords, created an immense sensation.\r\nInstead of the Trade Union, it was the management of the industry that\r\nwas put upon its trial. The large profits of the industry under war\r\nconditions were revealed, and especially the enormous gains of the most\r\nadvantageous mines; and although the Government itself had benefited\r\nthrough the Excess Profits’ Duty by 50, 60, and eventually 80 per cent\r\nof these gains, it became apparent to every one that, but for this\r\nabstraction, the price of coal might have been reduced and the miners’\r\nconditions improved to an extent never before suspected. It was seen,\r\ntoo, that it was the separate ownership of the mines which stood in\r\nthe way of the national sharing of the advantages of the best among\r\nthem. The chaotic state of the industry, with 1500 separately working\r\njoint-stock companies operating at very different costs--with no\r\nco-ordination of production, and with extremely wasteful arrangements\r\nfor transport and retail distribution--was vividly presented. At\r\nthe same time the unsatisfactory conditions under which the miners\r\nlived were impressively demonstrated, the scandalously bad housing of\r\nthe mining community in Lanarkshire and elsewhere making a national\r\nsensation. Prompt to the appointed day the Commission presented\r\nthree Reports. The three mine-owners proposed no improvement in the\r\norganisation of the industry, and offered an advance of eighteen pence\r\na day and a reduction of hours by one per day, being only half what\r\nwas demanded. The six representatives of the miners presented a long\r\nand reasoned justification of the men’s case; arguing that, with a\r\nunification of the industry in national ownership, with the adoption\r\nin all the mines of the mechanical improvements already in use in the\r\nbest-managed among them, with a more carefully concerted transport\r\nsystem, and with a municipal organisation of retail distribution,\r\nit was practicable to concede the men’s full claim of 30 per cent\r\nadvance and a two hours’ shortening of the working day without any\r\nincrease in the price of coal to the consumer. The Chairman of the\r\nCommission presented a third report, intermediate in its tenour, in\r\nwhich he was joined by the three disinterested capitalist members,\r\nproposing an immediate advance of two shillings per day, or 20 per\r\ncent, and an immediate reduction of one hour per day, with a promise\r\nof a further reduction by an hour in 1920, if the condition of the\r\nindustry warranted it. With regard to nationalisation, this Report\r\ndeclared that, as there had not been sufficient time to investigate\r\nthe proposal, the Commission would continue its sittings, and promptly\r\npresent a further report; but that it was plain, even on the evidence\r\nso far submitted, that the present system stood condemned, and\r\nthat some other system must, by national purchase of the mines, be\r\nsubstituted for it--either State administration, or some plan by which\r\nthe mines could be placed under a joint control in which the miners\r\nwould share. This impressive declaration by the judicial Chairman,\r\nsupported by the three capitalist members who were not mine-owners,\r\nmade a great public sensation. The Cabinet immediately accepted the\r\nChairman’s Report, pledging itself to carry it out “in the letter and\r\nin the spirit.” The Miners’ Federation hesitated, but ultimately, in\r\nconsideration of the offer of an immediate further examination of\r\nnationalisation, in the light of Mr. Justice Sankey’s significant\r\nfindings, decided to ballot its members, who, to the great relief\r\nof the public, by large majorities agreed to accept the Government\r\nproposal.\r\n\r\nThe Coal Industry Commission accordingly continued its sittings, now\r\nconcentrating upon the issue of Nationalisation and the participation\r\nof the miners in control. The dramatic feature of the inquiry was\r\nthe summoning of a succession of peers and other magnates owning\r\nmining royalties to the witness-chair, there to explain to the\r\nCommission and the public, under the sharp cross-examination of the\r\nMiners’ Federation officials, how they or their ancestors had become\r\npossessed of these property rights, how much they yielded in each\r\ncase, and what social service the recipients performed for their huge\r\nincomes. Much evidence was taken for and against State administration.\r\nWithin a couple of months of almost incessant daily sittings this\r\nindefatigable Commission presented its further Report, again hopelessly\r\ndivided. On the question of ownership of minerals, indeed, the whole\r\nthirteen Commissioners were unanimous--a momentous decision--in\r\nrecommending that the royalty owners should be at once expropriated\r\nin favour of the State. All thirteen Commissioners were unanimous,\r\ntoo, in recommending the admission of the workmen to some degree of\r\nparticipation in the management by Pit and District Committees. But\r\nthere the Commissioners’ agreement ended. What was significant was that\r\nnot the miners’ representatives only, but eight out of the thirteen\r\n(including the Chairman) reported in favour of expropriating all the\r\nexisting colliery companies and other coal-owners. The Chairman,\r\nsupported (in general terms and subject to additional suggestion)\r\nby the six miners’ representatives, proposed an elaborate scheme of\r\nNationalisation, with administration under a Minister of Mines by\r\njoint District Councils and Pit Committees, in which the men would be\r\nlargely represented. The other expropriating Commissioner preferred to\r\nvest the mines in a series of District Coal Corporations of capitalist\r\nshareholders, limited as to dividend, and working under public control,\r\nwith a restricted participation of the men in the administration. Five\r\nCommissioners, including all three coal-owners, whilst agreeing to the\r\nNationalisation of Minerals, refused to contemplate any substantial\r\nchange in the working of the mines, least of all any effective sharing\r\nof the workmen in the administration; though even this capitalist\r\nminority gave lip-homage to the principle by recommending the formation\r\nof purely Advisory Pit and District Committees.\r\n\r\nThe Government, which had continued in administrative and financial\r\ncontrol of all the collieries of the United Kingdom, whilst agreeing\r\nto adopt, in the spirit and in the letter, the terms of Mr. Justice\r\nSankey’s first Report, took no steps to bring it into effect, and left\r\nthe local mine-owners and miners’ Unions to adjust for themselves\r\nthe hours and new rates of pay which it involved. Suddenly, a few\r\nweeks before the new arrangements were to come into force, the Coal\r\nController issued an order that no increase of rates was to exceed 10\r\nper cent--a patent blunder, as it was the average reduction of output\r\nthat Mr. Justice Sankey had estimated at 10 per cent, and it was the\r\nactual reduction in each district that had to be compensated for. The\r\nYorkshire Miners’ Association had almost completed its arrangements\r\nwith the Yorkshire mine-owners for a higher percentage of increase\r\nwhen the Government prohibition was received. The result was an\r\nangry strike which stopped the whole Yorkshire coalfield for several\r\nweeks, and spread to Nottinghamshire. In the end the Government had\r\nto withdraw its mistaken prohibition; and the increase of rates, in\r\nYorkshire as elsewhere, was, as the miners had asked, made as nearly as\r\npossible proportionate to the expected local reduction in output caused\r\nby the reduction of hours. The hasty action on both sides and the\r\nmisunderstandings due to imperfect knowledge, or imperfect expression,\r\nlost the nation some four million tons of coal, and cost the Yorkshire\r\nMiners’ Association about £356,000.\r\n\r\nIn October 1919 Mr. Lloyd George announced that whilst the\r\nGovernment would propose the nationalisation of mining royalties,\r\nand some-undefined “trustification” of the mines by districts, there\r\nwould be no adoption of Mr. Justice Sankey’s Report. The Miners’\r\nFederation refused to accept anything in the nature of capitalist\r\n“trustification,” and called in vain on the Government to fulfil its\r\npledge to carry out the Report. In December 1919 the Federation, in\r\nconjunction with the Labour Party, the Parliamentary Committee of the\r\nTrades Union Congress, and the Co-operative Union, began a campaign\r\nof propaganda in favour of the Nationalisation of the Coal Supply,\r\nthe effect of which, industrially and politically, has yet to become\r\nmanifest. We have to break off the story in the middle of a critical\r\nperiod.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RAILWAYMEN\r\n\r\nAnother great industry, that of the operating staff of the railway\r\nsystem--scarcely mentioned in the first edition of our _History_--has\r\ncome forcibly to the front. Right down to the end of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, indeed, the railway guards and signalmen, engine-drivers and\r\nfiremen, shunters and porters, mechanics and labourers--though they\r\nnumbered something like 5 per cent of all the male manual-working\r\nwage-earners--played hardly any part in the Trade Union Movement.\r\nScattered in small numbers all over the country, and divided among\r\nthemselves by differences of grade, conditions, and pay, they long\r\nseemed incapable of organisation as a vocation. For a whole generation\r\nafter the establishment of railways no one appears to have thought\r\nTrade Unionism any more permissible among their employees than\r\namong the soldiers or the police. In 1865 an attempt to establish\r\n“The Railway Working Men’s Provident Benefit Society”--which soon\r\nbecame virtually a Trade Union--by Charles Bassett Vincent, a clerk\r\nin the Railway Clearing House, was ruthlessly crushed by summary\r\ndismissals. In the same year an Association of Engine-drivers and\r\nFiremen on the North-Eastern Railway actually started a strike, but\r\nperished of the attempt. Not until the end of 1871 was a lasting\r\nTrade Union established, and then only by the assistance of Michael\r\nBass, M.P., a large railway shareholder, by whose long-continued\r\nand entirely disinterested financial and other help the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Railway Servants struggled into being, with Frederick\r\nEvans as its first effective secretary. Other societies followed, of\r\nlocal or sectional character; but even in 1892, after twenty years\r\nof organisation, and various abortive strikes, there were fewer than\r\n50,000 railwaymen in any sort of Trade Union, or less than one in seven\r\nof the persons employed.[618]\r\n\r\nThe objects of such railwaymen’s societies as existed were for many\r\nyears confined to the protection of members from “victimisation” or\r\nother tyranny; to the provision of friendly benefits; and to spasmodic\r\nattempts to get accidents prevented or compensated for, and hours\r\nof labour reduced. Wages questions took up little of the attention\r\nof the railway Unions of these years; but strikes on particular\r\nrailways--sometimes of particular grades or at particular centres only\r\nof a single railway--now and then occurred; usually in resentment\r\nof some act of tyranny, or against some specially oppressive hours\r\nof labour, and often without the prior approval of the Executive\r\nCommittee. In 1890 the Amalgamated Society for the first time launched\r\nan aggressive policy, mainly as regards the hours of labour, which were\r\nindeed scandalous.[619] A prolonged strike for a shorter working day on\r\nthe Scottish lines at Christmas 1890 ended in failure, and the merging\r\nof the remnant of the Scottish Society of Railway Servants in the\r\nlarger Union. But it aroused public attention and led to an effective\r\nexposure by a Select Committee of the House of Commons in 1891-92. As\r\na result the Board of Trade was given certain statutory powers in 1893\r\nto remedy this tyranny--powers of which, unfortunately, little use was\r\nmade. Not for nine years afterwards did the Board of Trade even call\r\nupon the railway companies for a return showing in how many cases men\r\nwere kept on duty in excess of twelve hours at a stretch. Four-fifths\r\nof the railwaymen were still outside the ranks of Trade Unionism and\r\ncould therefore be both oppressed by their employers and flouted by\r\nthe Government Department. Their very right to combine was denied. Sir\r\nGeorge Findlay, the General Manager of the London and North-Western\r\nRailway, voiced the common opinion of the Companies when he declared\r\nthat “you might as well have a Trade Union or an ‘Amalgamated Society’\r\nin the Army, where discipline has to be kept at a very high standard,\r\nas have it on railways.”\r\n\r\nIn December 1896, indeed, a determined attempt was made to root out\r\nTrade Unionism in Sir George Findlay’s own railway company by the\r\ndismissal of men discovered to be Trade Unionists. Through the activity\r\nof the Society these victims found influential friends, who by public\r\nand private pressure compelled their reinstatement. The excitement\r\ncaused by this incident had some share in swelling the membership of\r\nthe Amalgamated Society, which doubled its numbers during the year\r\n1897; and made its first big stride in the “All Grades Movement” in\r\nthat year. Previous movements had been local and sectional, and nearly\r\nalways in the interests of particular grades. For the first time all\r\nthe railway companies were approached simultaneously, with a request\r\nfor improvements in all grades from one end of the service to the\r\nother--a reduction of the time of duty, so as to bring the working\r\nday down to ten, and for some grades eight hours; extra payments for\r\novertime, and a uniform advance of 2s. per week for all grades except\r\nthose for whom an eight hours day was sought. The Companies refused\r\neven to consider this very moderate request, and nearly a decade was\r\nto pass--a decade of slow building up of the organisation, first under\r\nMr. Richard Bell and Mr J. E. Williams, and then under Mr. J. H.\r\nThomas--before the Trade Unions of railwaymen were able to compel a\r\nhearing for their case.[620]\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, and with it the\r\nwhole Trade Union Movement, suffered in the law courts a temporary\r\nset-back. An impulsive strike on the Taff Vale Railway in South Wales,\r\naccompanied by extensive and successful picketing, was not countenanced\r\nby the Executive, but was eventually endorsed by its decision to take\r\nup the men’s case; and the Railway Company sued the Society for the\r\nloss occasioned by what were alleged to be the unlawful acts of its\r\nofficers. To the surprise of the lawyers, as well as of the public, the\r\njudges held that--in spite of what had seemed the explicit provisions\r\nof the Trade Union Acts of 1871-76--a Trade Union could be made\r\nanswerable in damages for all the acts of its officials, central or\r\nlocal, as if it were a corporate body, whilst still being denied the\r\nprivileges of a corporate body. The strike and legal proceedings cost\r\nthe Society from first to last nearly £50,000, whilst the danger to the\r\ncorporate funds of all Trade Unions that the decision revealed put a\r\ndamper on even the best justified strikes until, under persistent Trade\r\nUnion pressure, strengthened by the entry into the House of Commons of\r\na reinforced Labour Party, the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 restored the\r\nlaw to its state prior to the judicial decisions of 1902.\r\n\r\nThe railwaymen could then renew their “All Grades Movement” which the\r\nCompanies in January 1907 again declined to consider, steadfastly\r\nrefusing any recognition of the men’s Trade Unions, and callously\r\ndenying their grievances.[621] Ballots of the membership of the\r\nAmalgamated Society and the General Union decided on a strike by 80,026\r\nto 1857 votes, and in November 1907 a national stoppage was at hand\r\nwhen Mr. Lloyd George intervened as President of the Board of Trade,\r\ncompelled the Companies to listen to reason, and persuaded both parties\r\nto accept an elaborate scheme of Local and Central Conciliation Boards,\r\ncomposed of equal numbers representing management and men, with an\r\nimpartial chairman and authority to decide on wages and hours. These\r\nConciliation Boards, unsatisfactory as they proved, represented a real\r\ntriumph. For the first time the autocracy of the railway management\r\nwas broken. There was, it is true, still no express recognition of\r\nthe Trade Unions, but the men’s representatives were to be freely\r\nelected on each railway by all the employees grouped according to\r\ntheir grades; and these elected representatives met the management on\r\nprofessedly equal terms. The elections showed how thoroughly justified\r\nwas the claim of the Railwaymen’s Trade Unions that they were voicing\r\nthe wishes of practically the whole body of railwaymen. In spite of\r\nstrenuous efforts by the management on most of the lines, and of the\r\nunfortunate jealousies among the different societies, in nearly all\r\ncases the nominees of one or other of the Unions were elected, often by\r\nlarge majorities. For the next few years the Amalgamated Society and\r\nthe Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen were busy\r\nin fighting the cases of the various grades through the Conciliation\r\nBoards, and in securing thereby many small increases of wages and\r\nreductions of hours. But matters did not go smoothly. The Companies,\r\nfor the most part, pursued a policy of obstruction and postponement,\r\ndelaying the awards, quibbling about their application, and in some\r\ncases deliberately evading their terms, notably by inventing new\r\ngrades to which men could be appointed at lower rates of pay than\r\nthose prescribed. The “impartial” chairmen, moreover, differed among\r\nthemselves in the assumptions on which they proceeded, and some of\r\nthe awards caused great resentment. Meanwhile the cost of living was\r\nsteadily rising, and railwaymen as a whole were falling further behind\r\nother organised workers. Progress was delayed in 1909-10 by a new\r\nset-back which the Amalgamated Society suffered in the law courts, in\r\nthe prolonged litigation carried by one of its members, with capitalist\r\nassistance, right up to the House of Lords, by which the participation\r\nof any Trade Union in political activity was declared invalid--a\r\npiece of “judge-made law” to which we shall recur, and for which the\r\nGovernment and Parliament at first refused all redress. Suddenly, in\r\nAugust 1911, the pot boiled over. There was a spirit of revolt in the\r\nLabour world. In June and July the seamen and the dockers had struck,\r\nand stopped the port of London. There was an outburst of “unauthorised”\r\nrailway strikes at Manchester, Liverpool, and some other big towns,\r\nand a general demand for a national strike. The Executives of the four\r\nprincipal railwaymen’s Unions, for once acting closely in concert, gave\r\nthe Companies twenty-four hours to decide whether they would consent\r\nto meet the men’s representatives, or face a national stoppage. Once\r\nmore the Government intervened, Mr. Asquith offering a Royal Commission\r\nof indefinite duration and issue, merely to propose amendments in\r\nthe scheme of Conciliation Boards, and at the same time definitely\r\ninforming the men--a fact which they judiciously refrained from\r\npublishing--that the Government would not hesitate to use the troops\r\nto prevent the commerce of the country from being interfered with.[622]\r\nThe Unions refused the illusory offer, and a national strike began,\r\nwhich, although far from universal, was sufficient to disorganise\r\nthe whole railway service--as many as 200,000 men stopping work--and\r\nwas rapidly bringing industry to a standstill. At the instance of\r\nMr. Winston Churchill, who was then Home Secretary, an overpowering\r\ndisplay was made with the troops, which were sent to Manchester and\r\nother places, without requisition by the civil authorities, at the\r\nmere request of the Companies. In fact, a policy of repression had\r\nbeen decided on, and bloodshed was near at hand. In vain did the Union\r\nleaders ask Mr. Asquith, as Prime Minister, to take steps to obtain a\r\nmeeting between the Companies’ managers and the Union representatives.\r\nWiser counsels seem to have prevailed in the Cabinet, which\r\nperemptorily instructed the Companies to let their General Managers\r\nmeet the men’s representatives face to face at the Board of Trade.\r\nFor just upon twelve hours these managers, thus coerced, negotiated\r\nwith four representatives of the Unions, together with Mr. Henderson\r\nand Mr. J. R. MacDonald of the Parliamentary Labour Party. At last\r\nan agreement was made--the first ever concluded between the Railway\r\nCompanies as a whole and the Trade Unions of their employees--for\r\nan ending of the strike, on terms of complete reinstatement of the\r\nstrikers; an immediate consideration by the Conciliation Boards of\r\nall grievances; and a prompt investigation by a bipartite Royal\r\nCommission of the dissatisfaction with these Boards, and the best way\r\nof amending the scheme.[623] When the Commission reported--it was\r\nultimately termed a Special Committee of Inquiry--the Railwaymen’s\r\nUnion once more asked the Companies to meet them for negotiation, which\r\nthe Companies again refused to do. On the Unions resolving to ballot\r\ntheir members as to a national strike, the House of Commons set a new\r\nprecedent by passing, at the instance of the Government, a resolution\r\nformally recommending a joint meeting, whereupon the Companies gave\r\nway. At the meeting that ensued a new scheme of Conciliation Boards\r\nwas jointly agreed to, amending the 1907 scheme generally on the line\r\nof the Special Committee’s report, but introducing most of the other\r\nmodifications that the Unions thought necessary. The machinery was made\r\nmore rapid in action, and the scope of the Boards was extended. Most\r\nimportant of all, the men’s side of each Board was allowed to choose as\r\nsecretary a person not in the employ of the Company; and it accordingly\r\nbecame possible for a Trade Union official to take up this work, and\r\nthat not only for a single grade but, by acting for several Boards,\r\nsimultaneously for all grades. This was not “recognition” in form, but\r\nat any rate the Trade Union official was let in. During the next two\r\nyears, in spite of incredible obstructions, quibblings, and evasions by\r\nthe Companies, a number of small improvements in the terms of service\r\nwere obtained from the Boards for all the grades on practically all\r\nthe lines. A result of this joint working of even greater importance\r\nwas the merging, in 1913, after prolonged negotiations, of three out\r\nof the four principal societies of manual railway workers[624]--the\r\nAmalgamated, the General Union, and the United Pointsmen and\r\nSignalmen--into a new Trade Union upon a carefully revised basis, under\r\nthe title of the National Union of Railwaymen.\r\n\r\nThe “New Model” for Trade Union structure thus deliberately adopted\r\nmerits attention. In contrast with what we have called the “New\r\nModel,” in 1851 of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, that of 1913\r\nrepresents an attempt to include, in a single “amalgamated” Union,\r\nall the various “crafts” and grades of workers engaged in a single\r\nindustry throughout the whole kingdom. The declared object of the\r\nNational Union of Railwaymen is “to secure the complete organisation\r\nof all workers employed on or in connection with any railway in the\r\nUnited Kingdom.” It thus definitely negatives both “sectionalism”\r\nand “localism” in favour of “Industrial Unionism.” Indeed, it may be\r\nsuggested that the new constitution passes, by definition, even beyond\r\nthe “Industrial Unionism,” to which the most advanced section of Trade\r\nUnionists were aspiring, into what has been termed “Employmental\r\nUnionism,” in that it seeks to enrol in one Union, not merely all\r\nsections of railway workers, but actually all who are employed by any\r\nrailway undertaking--thus including, not only the engineering and\r\nwood-working mechanics in the railway engineering workshops,[625] but\r\nalso the cooks, waiters, and housemaids at the fifty-five railway\r\nhotels; the sailors and firemen on board the railway companies’ fleets\r\nof steamers, and (though no trouble has actually arisen about them)\r\nthe compositors, lithographers, and bookbinders whom the railway\r\nprinting works employ in the production of tickets, time-tables,\r\noffice stationery, and advertisement posters; even the men whom one,\r\nat least, of the largest companies keeps in constant employment at\r\nthe manufacture of crutches and wooden legs for the disabled members\r\nof its staff. This all-inclusiveness has, since 1913, brought the\r\nNational Union of Railwaymen into conflict with many other Trade\r\nUnions; and the question of the proper lines of demarcation has so\r\nfar remained unsettled. The principal new feature in constitutional\r\nstructure was the establishment of a distinct legislature--the Annual\r\nGeneral Meeting--consisting, in addition to the President and General\r\nSecretary, of sixty representatives elected by the membership in\r\ngeographical constituencies of approximately equal size. Subordinate\r\nto the Annual General Meeting (which can be summoned specially when\r\nrequired) is the Executive Committee of the President, General\r\nSecretary, and twenty-four other members, the latter being severally\r\nelected by the device of the Single Transferable Vote by each of four\r\nprescribed departments of members in each of six gigantic geographical\r\nconstituencies; one-third of such representatives retiring annually,\r\nand after each triennial term of service, becoming ineligible for three\r\nyears, whilst the Branches to which they belong also become unable to\r\nnominate representatives for a like term. The Executive Committee,\r\nwhich, like the Annual General Meeting, consists of working railwaymen,\r\npaid only for their days of service, meets quarterly and appoints four\r\nsectional sub-committees, which must also meet at least quarterly.\r\nNoteworthy, too, is the District Council, which--constitutionally\r\nonly a voluntary federation of geographically adjacent Branches for\r\npropagandist and purely consultative purposes--has, with an unofficial\r\nNational Federation of District Councils, developed into an active\r\n“caucus” of the more energetic members for discussing and promoting\r\n“forward movements” in the Annual General Meeting, and “organising” the\r\nelections to the Executive Committee.\r\n\r\nWith such a constitution, and the administration of extensive friendly\r\nbenefits in a society now approaching half a million members, it is\r\ninevitable that the Executive Committee should wield extensive powers.\r\nIt initiates and conducts all trade movements, and can therefore call\r\na national strike, even without a ballot vote; and whilst it may take\r\na ballot vote at any time on any question, the rules expressly provide\r\nthat it is not to be bound by the members’ decision. Originally the\r\nExecutive Committee had power also “to settle” any dispute; but this\r\nwas withdrawn by resolutions of the Annual General Meetings of 1915\r\nand 1916, which required all settlements to be reported to itself for\r\nratification. In practice very large powers, both of office management\r\nand of negotiation, are necessarily exercised by the six salaried\r\nofficers, the President, the General Secretary, and the four Assistant\r\nSecretaries, each of whom is responsible for a separate branch of the\r\nUnion’s work. They have, however, not been able to prevent a series of\r\n“unauthorised” strikes, local or sectional in character.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of 1914 everything pointed to a further forward\r\nmovement by the N.U.R. Its Annual General Meeting cordially accepted\r\nthe Miners’ proposal to unite with them and the Transport Workers in\r\nthe so-called Triple Alliance. Moreover, its desires now began to go\r\nbeyond improvements in wages and hours. Its representatives had, for\r\ntwenty years, sometimes moved and always supported the resolutions\r\nof the Trades Union Congress in favour of the Nationalisation of\r\nRailways. In 1913 the Railway Clerks’ Association had gone a step\r\nfurther, and had asked also for participation in control. In 1914 the\r\nresolution intended to be submitted on behalf of the N.U.R. declared\r\nthat “no system of State Ownership of the railways will be acceptable\r\nto organised railwaymen which does not guarantee to them their full\r\npolitical and social rights, allow them a due measure of control\r\nand responsibility in the safe and efficient working of the railway\r\nsystem, and assure to them a fair and equitable participation in\r\nthe increased benefits likely to accrue from a more economical and\r\nscientific administration.” Here we have the first expressions of\r\nthe desire for participation in the management of the railways.[626]\r\nFrom that time forward the demand has become ever more explicit\r\nand determined. Meanwhile, however, the first step was plainly the\r\ndrastic amendment of the scheme of Conciliation Boards; and proposals\r\nwere under consideration when war broke out. In marked contrast with\r\ntheir previous action, the Railway Companies were actually meeting\r\nthe Union representatives in a joint committee of seven a side. The\r\ngrowth in membership of the National Union of Railwaymen at that date\r\nto over 300,000, and its entry into the “Triple Alliance” of miners,\r\nrailwaymen, and transport workers, had, in fact, at last compelled the\r\nCompanies, in fact, to concede “recognition,” although they denied at\r\nthe time that they were so doing. During the war the actual alteration\r\nof the scheme was to remain in abeyance, but the Executive Committee\r\ncame in 1915 to a provisional agreement with the Companies as to\r\ncertain amendments, which the Annual General Meeting of that year\r\nconsidered inadequate and refused to sanction. Meanwhile, in view of\r\nthe rising cost of living, successive war bonuses, uniform throughout\r\nthe Kingdom for all grades of the traffic staff, were obtained from the\r\nPresident of the Board of Trade--the cost, in effect, falling on the\r\nGovernment under its arrangement for guaranteeing to the shareholders\r\nthe net revenue of 1913--amounting altogether to 33s. per week for men,\r\n16s. 6d. per week for women and boys, and 8s. 3d. per week for girls,\r\nthus more than doubling the average pre-war wages. The Government,\r\nmoreover, promised sympathetic consideration of the men’s demand for an\r\nEight Hours’ Day immediately on the termination of the war.\r\n\r\nWhen the Armistice in November 1918 brought hostilities to an end,\r\nnegotiations were at once begun for a settlement of the outstanding\r\nquestions. The National Union of Railwaymen, in more friendly\r\nconjunction with the Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and\r\nFiremen, whilst gaining advances fully equivalent to the increase in\r\nthe cost of living, had secured in principle not only recognition, but\r\nalso the valuable right of entering into negotiation with the united\r\nmanagement of all the railways, instead of always being referred to\r\nthe several companies; and even more important, it had obtained, in\r\nthe uniform war bonuses, the basis of national rates of wages for\r\nthe several grades, instead of rates and classes of workers varying\r\nfrom company to company. It was now to secure, without an effort, the\r\nEight Hours’ Day, to come into operation on February 1, 1919, which\r\nthe Government, not even consulting the Railway Companies, singly or\r\ncollectively, in December 1918, conceded in principle without reduction\r\nof wages, whilst the necessary reclassification of workers and\r\nadjustment of times and wages on a national system became the subject\r\nof prolonged and difficult negotiations between the Railway Executive\r\nCommittee and the two principal Unions.\r\n\r\nThe negotiations for “standardisation” which necessarily involved\r\nthe amalgamation of the uniform war bonus with the varying basic\r\nrate, were dragged out by the Government from February to the end of\r\nAugust, to the growing irritation of the railwaymen. What occurred,\r\nas Ministers subsequently confessed, or rather boasted, was that,\r\nbeginning actually in February, the Government made extensive secret\r\npreparations to break the strike which it was foreseen would occur when\r\nthe Government’s decisions were made known. The railwaymen themselves\r\nconfidently expected, seeing that the cost of living had not fallen,\r\nbut was officially certified, in September 1919, at 115 per cent above\r\nthat of July 1914, that their rates would be “standardised upwards,” so\r\nas both to adopt the scales of the best companies for all the staff,\r\nand to include the whole of the war bonus. But this automatic inclusion\r\nof the war bonus in the Standard Rate, which some trades had already\r\nsecured, was exactly what the leading industrial employers were, for\r\ntheir own trades, anxious to prevent. They counted, indeed, on bringing\r\nabout throughout British industry, during 1919 or 1920, irrespective of\r\nany change in the cost of living, a general reduction of the “swollen”\r\nwages of war-time; and there was a prevalent feeling among them, which\r\nis known to have been shared by some, at least, of the Ministers, and\r\nquite frankly expressed, that a big “fight with the Trade Unions”\r\nwas inevitable, and that it would be “better to get it over” before\r\nindustry had generally restarted under peace conditions. How far Sir\r\nAuckland Geddes, who as President of the Board of Trade was responsible\r\nfor the negotiations, and his brother, Sir Eric Geddes, who as Minister\r\nof Transport took over the work, shared this view, and allowed it to\r\ninspire their official action, has not been revealed. The historian\r\ncan only note that the Government proceedings appear consistent with\r\nthis hypothesis. The Government deliberately separated from the mass\r\nof railwaymen the locomotive drivers and firemen, whose services were\r\nregarded as specially indispensable, and whose allegiance was divided\r\nbetween the two rival Unions. In August acceptable terms were proposed\r\nfor these two classes, which conceded not only the absorption of the\r\nwhole war bonus in the new scale of wages, but also certain further\r\nincreases of pay, coming near to the Union’s full claims. Such a\r\nconcession, it was subsequently noted, was admirably calculated, in\r\nthe event of a strike, to detach the drivers and firemen from their\r\nfellow-members; to divide the two Unions, and to arouse expectations\r\nin the other grades which would make it practically certain that they\r\nwould indignantly refuse the offer that was to be made in a few weeks.\r\nWhen the “definite” decision of the Government was sent to the Union,\r\nin a letter in which Sir Auckland Geddes with his own hand altered the\r\nword to “definitive,” as if in order to ensure an explosion, it was\r\nfound that by the new scale, beginning on January 1, 1920, every grade\r\nwas to suffer a reduction of existing earnings, varying from only\r\na shilling or two per week in some cases up to as much as sixteen\r\nshillings per week--the new standard rate of the porter, for instance,\r\nbeing fixed at 40s., as compared with the 51s. or 53s. that he was\r\nactually receiving, or with the 60s. per week for which the Union had\r\nasked. No explanation was given by the brothers Geddes that what was\r\nintended was that there should be on January 1, 1920, no reduction\r\nwhatever in the men’s earnings, and that the Government’s policy was\r\n(as subsequently stated by Mr. Lloyd George, but only on the very\r\nmorning of the strike, which was the first revelation of it) that there\r\nshould never be any reduction at all unless the cost of living fell\r\nfor over three months below 110 per cent in excess of pre-war prices,\r\nand that (as was announced only in the Government advertisements on\r\nthe eighth day of the strike) the future “sliding scale,” which had\r\nnever been definitely formulated, would be allowed to work upwards as\r\nwell as downwards. Unless the intention of the “definitive” offer was\r\nthen and there to provoke an indignant strike, why was no hint of this\r\n“policy for 1920” included; why was it left to be only incidentally\r\nrevealed, in such a way as not to be easily understood, in the final\r\npersonal discussion with the Prime Minister; and, seeing that the\r\nMinister of Food himself had publicly announced that what was probable,\r\nfrom January 1920, was not a fall but a further rise in the cost of\r\nliving, why was the alarming suggestion of a reduction to 40s. per\r\nweek ever made at all? It is almost impossible to avoid the inference\r\nthat the Government, which certainly decided the date and the issues,\r\ndecided also the strike itself, with a view to “beating the Union,”\r\nin order to get a free hand for railway reorganisation without the\r\nnecessity of consulting the operatives; in order, probably, to fit in\r\nwith the general capitalist project of a scaling down of the “swollen”\r\nwar-wages; and, as some say, in order to supply Mr. Lloyd George with a\r\nuseful “election stunt,” with which, in the eyes of the middle class,\r\nirretrievably to damage the Labour Party.\r\n\r\nWhether intentionally on the part of the Ministers, or by reason\r\nof an amazing maladroitness in their negotiations, what had been\r\nforeseen and expected by the Government, and for six months secretly\r\nprepared for, actually came to pass. On Wednesday, September 24, the\r\nExecutive Council of the National Union of Railwaymen issued orders\r\nfor a national strike to begin at midnight on Friday, September 26,\r\nunless countermanded by telegraph. So little had the Union intended\r\nor contemplated such action that absolutely no notice of the crisis\r\nhad been given to the Miners’ Federation or the Transport Workers’\r\nFederation, who were the railwaymen’s colleagues in the Triple\r\nAlliance; and the Union had only some £3000 available in cash. Efforts\r\nwere made by the men to avert the stoppage, which it was recognised\r\nwould be a national calamity. The Executive Council sought and obtained\r\nlong interviews with the Prime Minister himself on Thursday, and even\r\non the Friday morning; and the verbatim reports of these discussions\r\nreveal (_a_) that the Government showed no inclination to meet the\r\nmen’s case--Sir Eric Geddes peremptorily intervening at one point even\r\nto prevent a criticism of the “definitive” new scale being adduced;\r\n(_b_) that the Government did not even then set forth what subsequently\r\nturned out to have been the proposal that the Ministry of Transport had\r\nreally intended to make (unless, indeed, we are to assume that the\r\n“definitive” offer was silently changed in the course of the strike).\r\nAgain, it can only be inferred that Mr. Lloyd George either did not\r\nwish to prevent the strike or else was quite exceptionally below his\r\nusual level of lucidity in explanation of any scheme that he wished to\r\nhave accepted. What the Prime Minister did was immediately to denounce\r\nto the public the National Union of Railwaymen as engaged in an\r\nanarchist conspiracy!\r\n\r\nThe nine days’ stoppage that ensued was, in many respects, the most\r\nremarkable industrial conflict that we have yet seen. Half a million\r\nrailwaymen left their work at midnight on the 26th of September, the\r\nAssociated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen at once joining\r\nloyally with the N.U.R., and very nearly every member of either Union\r\ncoming out. The men on the Irish railways were directed to remain at\r\nwork. Never before had there been so nearly a complete stoppage of the\r\nrailway service from one end of Great Britain to the other. It is to be\r\nnoted that the third Union, the Railway Clerks’ Association (which had\r\ncome to include the Clerical, Administrative, and Supervisory Staffs),\r\ndirected its members to remain absolutely neutral, and not to do any of\r\nthe strikers’ work. The various Unions of Post Office employees sought\r\nand obtained an official decision that they were not to be called upon\r\nto do any service hitherto done by men on strike. The Government, which\r\nsent soldiers to guard some of the railway stations,[627] hastened\r\nto announce publicly--in significant contrast with its decision of\r\n1912--that in no case would the troops be employed to run trains. For\r\nthe first time the Government found itself liable to pay unemployment\r\nbenefit to all other workers who were stopped as a result of the\r\nstrike; and for the enormous extension of the State Unemployment\r\nBenefit that was expected to be required, arrangements were promulgated\r\nunder which the Benefit would be issued by each employer to his own\r\nwage-earners, when these were thrown idle by the strike; and that\r\nwhilst such persons might be called upon to take temporary employment\r\nin handling food supplies, they would not be required to accept service\r\non the railways themselves.\r\n\r\nThere was, in spite of wild newspaper exaggerations, practically no\r\ndisorder and no attempt to injure property. Except in a very few cases,\r\nin which local mishandling of the situation by the authorities led to\r\nresentment and misunderstanding, the Executive Council’s order that\r\nthe horses were not to be allowed to suffer was cordially acted on by\r\nthe men. The Government was allowed, without attempt at obstruction,\r\nto bring at once into operation the elaborate arrangements it had long\r\nbeen preparing, for ensuring the regular supply of London and other\r\nlarge towns with milk and other foodstuffs by means of an extensive\r\nmotor-lorry service. Volunteers for railway work were called for, and\r\nwith the aid of the small remnant of non-unionists a tiny trickle of\r\ntrains was set going, which provided for the local passenger service\r\nin London and some other cities; and gradually accomplished one or\r\ntwo long-distance trains per day, which carried the mails and were\r\ncrowded with venturous passengers. What stopped almost completely\r\nwas the mineral and heavy goods traffic, and by the end of the week\r\nso many industries had come to the end of their fuel, and so many\r\ncoalpits were short of waggons and of room at the pithead, that,\r\nwhilst nearly 400,000 workmen in collieries and factories were already\r\nidle, the next week would have seen literally millions unemployed.\r\nMeanwhile, in spite of press reports to the contrary, the Union\r\nExecutives knew that, whilst a few men returned to work, each day more\r\njoined the strikers, so that there were actually a greater number\r\nsigning the book at the end than at the beginning of the struggle.\r\nBut the National Union of Railwaymen found considerable difficulty in\r\nrealising from its investments, and in making locally available at a\r\ncouple of thousand centres, sufficient cash to pay immediately the\r\nhalf a million pounds of strike pay that was required; and only the\r\nprompt and cordial assistance of the Co-operative Wholesale Society’s\r\nprinting department, which got out the necessary supply of cheques in\r\nmarvellously quick time, and of the Co-operative Wholesale Society’s\r\nBank, which made the N.U.R. cheques payable at the several Co-operative\r\nSocieties themselves, averted a breakdown. Food was in some cases\r\nrefused to the strikers by shopkeepers; and it may be that it was only\r\nthe prompt assistance of the Co-operative Societies, which agreed to\r\nhonour vouchers issued by the local strike committees, that prevented\r\nthe Government from putting in operation a project of starving out the\r\nrailwaymen’s families by withdrawing their ration cards or withholding\r\nthe food supplies under Government control. One blow below the belt\r\nthe Government did strike in arbitrarily commanding the withholding\r\nfrom the strikers of a whole week’s pay which they had earned by their\r\nservice prior to the stoppage, and which it was the custom of the\r\ncompanies always to keep in hand for a week by way of security against\r\ntheft or embezzlement. This had never been done in any previous railway\r\nstrike. Whether or not the railwaymen had broken any legal contract\r\nof service by giving only three days’ notice of their strike, is not\r\nclear--the point appears never to have been raised or decided,--but in\r\nany case the companies had only a right to sue each man for any damages\r\nthat might be shown to be caused by such a breach of contract; and the\r\nGovernment had plainly no legal warrant for becoming the judge in its\r\nown cause, and itself arbitrarily assessing the damages due from each\r\nman at precisely one week’s earnings. This action, coupled with the\r\nevasive and ever-changing terms of the Government’s wage proposals,\r\nand the campaign of abuse that the Government organised throughout the\r\npress--personally directed by Sir William Sutherland, one of the Prime\r\nMinister’s secretaries--had a great influence in rallying the Trade\r\nUnion world in support of the railwaymen.\r\n\r\nThe “publicity campaign,” by which, for the first time in an industrial\r\nstruggle, a persistent organised appeal was made by both sides to\r\npublic opinion, was, indeed, the most remarkable feature of the\r\nstruggle. At the outset the Government, in spite of the outspoken\r\nadvocacy of the _Daily Herald_, had it all its own way. The public,\r\nseriously inconvenienced by the stoppage, was told by nearly every\r\nnewspaper in the Kingdom--daily supplied by a Government office with\r\na lengthy bulletin of “Strike News”--that the strike was the result\r\nof an “anarchist” conspiracy among the railwaymen; that the Union had\r\nwantonly broken off negotiations without cause because it positively\r\nwished to “hold up” the whole community; that the Government had\r\nnot really intended any reduction of wages at all, and that the\r\nfigure of 40s. had reference only to the contingency of the cost of\r\nliving reverting to what it was before the war; that, in fact, the\r\nGovernment were positively doubling the railwaymen’s wages, and that\r\nthe men, realising this, and discovering how they had been deceived\r\nby their Executive Council, were resuming their duties at all points.\r\nTo counteract this Government propaganda, the _Daily Herald_ made\r\nthe most enterprising arrangements for getting its issue distributed\r\nall over England, and more than doubled its circulation, whilst the\r\nNational Union of Railwaymen employed its own Publicity Department,\r\nutilising for this purpose the Labour Research Department.[628] A\r\nnumber of competent writers, cartoonists, and statisticians belonging\r\nto the Labour Party placed their services in this way at the Research\r\nDepartment’s disposal, so that the Executive Council was able, within a\r\ncouple of days, to pour forth a stream of articles, letters, speeches,\r\nand cartoons, for which the newspapers generally accorded space.[629]\r\nEvery move of the Government, and every statement that it issued,\r\nwas immediately countered by an appropriate answer. When Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge supplied a message denouncing the strikers which appeared on\r\nthe film in every cinema, Mr. J. H. Thomas was himself filmed in the\r\nact of delivering a cogent reply. But the Union’s Publicity Department\r\nfound the space given by the newspapers inadequate, and started\r\nplacing full-page advertisements in the _Times_ and other newspapers,\r\nin which the Government’s equivocations and evasions as to the wages\r\noffered were effectively exposed. The Government followed suit,\r\nand presently the two advertisements appeared on successive pages,\r\nwith the unforeseen result that the Government’s statement of its\r\nproposals to the men was detected in changing from day to day as the\r\nstrike continued, growing progressively more favourable to the men,\r\nbut professing still to be the “definitive” decision of Sir Auckland\r\nGeddes which had provoked the strike. The outcome of a week’s skilfully\r\norganised “publicity” was a steady shifting of public opinion, and even\r\na distinct change in the newspaper editorials. By the end of the week\r\nthe men’s case was winning.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the leaders of the principal Trade Unions indirectly\r\naffected by the railway stoppage, notably the various sections of\r\nTransport Workers, together with officials or representatives of the\r\nMiners, the Parliamentary Committee, and the Labour Party, had been\r\nmeeting in anxious conclave--summoned, it should be stated, by the\r\nExecutive of the National Transport Workers’ Federation--with a view to\r\nrestraining their own members from impetuous action in support of the\r\nrailwaymen, and to bringing pressure to bear on both parties to secure\r\na settlement. At first the prospect seemed hopeless. The Government\r\ntook up an attitude of defiance. Mr. Lloyd George declared that he\r\nwould not enter into any negotiations with the railwaymen’s Unions\r\nuntil the men had unconditionally returned to their duty. A national\r\nappeal was made to all the Local Authorities--not to strengthen the\r\npolice force by special constables, as is the constitutional procedure,\r\nbut to institute a “Citizen Guard,” in order to repel the forces of\r\ndisorder; a wild use of a term of bad omen, which was calculated,\r\nif not intended, to bring the “class war” into the streets. It was\r\nknown that measures of arbitrary confiscation of the Union funds\r\nwere seriously under consideration, together with discriminatory\r\nissues of food supplies. On the other side, the feeling of the Trade\r\nUnionists was rising to anger. The position could not well have been\r\nmore serious. But the “eleven”--afterwards the “fourteen”--Trade\r\nUnion mediators were patient and persistent. They had long interviews\r\nwith the railwaymen’s Executive. They had long discussions with the\r\nPrime Minister, the Chancellor of the Exchequer, and the Minister\r\nof Transport. They cleared up misunderstandings. They eliminated\r\nprovocative expressions. They brought the Government to admit\r\nthat there was no present chance of reducing wages. They got the\r\nrailwaymen to see that merely to postpone the issue was to strengthen\r\ntheir grip upon what they were actually receiving. Notwithstanding\r\nthe Government’s defiant words, the Trade Union mediators got the\r\nrailwaymen’s Executive Council into prolonged and repeated discussions\r\nat 10 Downing Street with the Prime Minister and his colleagues.[630]\r\nAt last, on Sunday morning, October 3, Mr. Lloyd George and Mr. Thomas\r\nwere closeted together for the final stage; the news was immediately\r\nflashed all over the kingdom that the strike was settled, and in the\r\nevening Mr. Thomas announced to a mass meeting of railwaymen in the\r\nAlbert Hall the terms of settlement. These included an immediate\r\nresumption of work without victimisation or recrimination; payment of\r\nthe impounded arrears of wages; “stabilisation” of existing earnings\r\nof all rates (except where improved) until September 30, 1920;\r\nnegotiations as to “standardisation” and settlement of wage scales to\r\nbe begun again, and a settlement to be come to before December 31,\r\n1919; and the lowest adult railwayman to be raised forthwith to 51s.\r\nper week as a minimum. Before the end of 1919 it was announced that the\r\nGovernment had agreed to concede, for the future, that all questions\r\nrelating to the conditions of service should be dealt with, not by\r\nthe railway companies but by a Central Board of ten members (with\r\npower to increase by a further one on each side), five nominees of the\r\nNational Union of Railwaymen and the Associated Society of Locomotive\r\nEngineers and Firemen, and five representatives of the railway\r\nmanagement. In case of disagreement, reference will be made to an\r\nAppeal Board of twelve members, four nominated by these Trade Unions,\r\nfour representing the management, and four the general public, with a\r\nchairman nominated by the Government. What is specially significant\r\nis that it is recognised that “the public” does not consist merely of\r\nthe upper and middle, or of the capitalist and professional classes.\r\nOf the four representatives of the public, two are to be nominated,\r\nrespectively, by the Associated Chambers of Commerce and the Federation\r\nof British Industries, and two, respectively, by the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee of the Trades Union Congress and the Co-operative Union, who\r\nare thus taken to represent the four-fifths of the population (and\r\ntherefore of the railway users) who are manual working wage-earners.\r\nAt the same time it was conceded that the Advisory Committee for\r\nRailway Management, which replaces under the Minister of Transport\r\nthe Railway Executive Committee, is to include, from the start, three\r\nrepresentatives of the railwaymen’s Unions, all the members having\r\nequal and identical functions and rights.\r\n\r\nWe do not yet know what agreement will be reached about\r\n“standardisation” or the future scale of wages, but the Ministry of\r\nTransport is not likely to try another fall with the railwaymen’s Trade\r\nUnions. The strike has had, indeed, results of the first importance.\r\nThe Government has learnt that Trade Unionism is not easily beaten,\r\neven when all the resources of the State are put forth against it, and\r\nwhen public opinion is incensed. The great capitalist organisations\r\nhave seen the warning against their projects of a general reduction of\r\nwages; and this is postponed, at least, for a year. On the other hand,\r\nthe railwaymen’s Unions have realised the magnitude of the struggle\r\ninto which they so precipitately entered, or into which they were so\r\nartfully inveigled. The need for, and the potency of, skilled publicity\r\nwork, and the possibilities of a highly organised and adequately\r\nsupported Labour Research Department, are commonly recognised. Finally,\r\nit is seen that national industrial conflicts of such a magnitude are\r\nmatters of wider concern to the Trade Union world than any one Union\r\ncan appreciate; and an attempt was made, to be subsequently described,\r\nif not to continue in existence the group of “Fourteen Mediators,” at\r\nleast to get established some authoritative standing Council, by which\r\nthe approach of an impending industrial crisis of national scope could\r\nbe closely watched, so that all the necessary steps may be taken in\r\ntime to deal with the situation in the best possible way. The Trade\r\nUnion world realised its need for what was called a General Staff.\r\n\r\n\r\nAMALGAMATIONS AND FEDERATIONS\r\n\r\nWhilst the numerical strength and industrial and political influence\r\nof the several Trade Unions have thus steadily increased during the\r\npast thirty years, it is less easy to characterise the changes in the\r\nrelations of Trade Unions with each other.\r\n\r\nThe multiplicity of separate organisations in which the six or seven\r\nmillion Trade Unionists are grouped, and the complication and diversity\r\nof the relations among the various societies, continue to-day, as they\r\ndid thirty years ago, to baffle classification, and almost to defy\r\nanalysis. It remains as impossible as it was in 1890 to state precisely\r\nhow many distinct Trade Unions are in existence, because the endless\r\nvariety of their federal organisations makes it uncertain which\r\nof the local or sectional Unions are to be counted as independent\r\nsocieties. We estimate, however, that upon any computation the number\r\nof financially distinct organisations, which we may put at about 1100,\r\nremains approximately what it was thirty years ago. The tendency to\r\namalgamation, that is to say, has just about kept pace, arithmetically,\r\nwith the starting of new organisations, whilst the average membership\r\nof each unit has more than quadrupled.\r\n\r\nSuch a statement fails, however, to do justice to the change that\r\nhas come over the Trade Union world. Thirty years ago it was, on the\r\nwhole, a congeries of numerically small units, only two or three of\r\nwhich counted as many as 50,000 members. To-day there are nearly a\r\ndozen which severally manage memberships of a quarter of a million,\r\nand probably fifty which deal with more than 50,000 each. A few other\r\nnational societies of smaller membership are of some importance.\r\nScattered up and down the United Kingdom a thousand other local or\r\nsectional societies exist, with memberships from a few dozen to a\r\nfew thousand, but these play no part and exercise no influence in\r\nthe movement as a whole. Probably five-sixths of all the Trade Union\r\nmembership, and practically all its effective force, are to be found\r\namong the hundred principal societies to which the Ministry of Labour\r\nhas long confined its detailed statistics.[631]\r\n\r\nThe movement for the amalgamation of competing societies has, during\r\nthe past decade, been specially energetic and persistent. This has\r\narisen, partly spontaneously, from the obvious disadvantages attendant\r\nboth on rivalry between Trade Unions seeking to enrol the same classes\r\nof members throughout the kingdom--such as that between the various\r\nsocieties of railway employees--and on the division of workmen of the\r\nsame craft among a number of independent local societies, such as the\r\nCoopers, the Chippers and Drillers, and the Painters and other branches\r\nof the Building Trades. But during the past decade the movement has\r\nbeen reinforced by the desire for an organisation based on the whole\r\nof an industry, such as engineering, housebuilding, mining, or the\r\nrailway service, in which all the co-operating crafts and grades of\r\nworkers would be associated in a single Industrial Union; in contrast\r\nwith the earlier conception of the separate organisation of each craft\r\nthroughout the whole kingdom; such as that of the carpenters, the\r\nenginemen, the engineering mechanics, the clerks, and by analogy the\r\ngeneral labourers, in whatsoever industry they may be working. The case\r\nfor the Industrial Union in such an industry as mining, for example,\r\nmerely from the standpoint of Collective Bargaining, and for the sake\r\nof getting effective Common Rules, has always been a strong one; but\r\nthe movement for the substitution of “Industrial” for “Craft” Unionism\r\nhas been strengthened since about 1911 by the aspirations of those who\r\nsaw in Trade Unionism something more than an organisation for raising\r\nwages and shortening the working day. If the wage-earners were ever to\r\nobtain, through their own voluntary associations, the control of their\r\nown working lives, and to obtain a steadily increasing participation\r\nin the direction of industry; if a Vocational Democracy were to be\r\nsuperimposed on a Democracy based on geographical constituencies; it\r\nseemed as if this could be done only by Trade Unions co-extensive with\r\neach separate industry. The influence of the movement known as “Guild\r\nSocialism” has accordingly been exercised, on the whole, in favour\r\nof Industrial Unionism, not so much for the sake of its immediate\r\nadvantages in improving the conditions of the wage-contract, as because\r\nit was only in this form that Trade Unionism could become the vehicle\r\nof aspirations to the control of each industry by the whole mass of the\r\nworkers employed therein.\r\n\r\nExcept in the way of industrial federations, to be hereafter referred\r\nto, it is only in mining and the railway service that any great\r\nprogress has been made in this direction. The Miners’ Federation of\r\nGreat Britain, established, as we have seen, only in 1888, with no\r\nmore than 36,000 members, has attracted to itself, year by year, an\r\nalmost continuous stream of local or sectional organisations among\r\nthe 1,200,000 workers in and about the coal and iron-stone mines;\r\nsuccessively absorbing into one or other of its local units or\r\naffiliating directly to itself, not only all the district associations,\r\nold or new, of coal-hewers and other underground workers, but also\r\nsome of the separate organisations of enginemen and firemen, mine\r\nmechanics, deputies and overmen, colliery clerks, cokemen, and others\r\nemployed in or about the mines, until its aggregate membership in 1920\r\nis somewhere about 900,000. And though the Miners’ Federation is still\r\nonly a Federation of fully autonomous district associations--some\r\nof these, too, being themselves federations of the organisations of\r\nlesser localities; and although it still depends for its funds almost\r\nentirely upon specific levies upon its constituents, it has found\r\nmeans, by its frequently meeting delegate conferences, controlling\r\nthe strong Executive Committee which they elect, to centralise very\r\neffectively the general policy of the whole mining industry, notably\r\nwith regard to the hours of labour, the conditions of safety, the\r\npercentage of general advances of wages and the amount of the national\r\nwar bonuses, and last, though not least, on the burning issue of\r\nnationalisation of the mines and the participation of the miners in\r\ntheir administration. But although the Miners’ Federation embodies in\r\nits constitution the principles of federalism and an extreme local\r\nautonomy, it takes no account of sectional differences, and makes no\r\nprovision for the representation at its delegate conferences, or upon\r\nits Executive Committee, of any distinct grades or sections. Perhaps,\r\nfor this reason, the Federation does not yet speak directly for all\r\nthe organised manual working wage-earners in the industry. There are\r\nat least forty separate Trade Unions of enginemen, boilermen and\r\nfiremen, colliery mechanics, cokemen, under-managers, deputies, overmen\r\nand other officials, colliery clerks, and surface-workers of various\r\nkinds, not yet affiliated to the Miners’ Federation, either locally or\r\nnationally; these have formed National Federations, parallel with the\r\nMiners’ Federation of Great Britain, of enginemen, deputies, colliery\r\nmechanics and under-managers respectively; and in February 1917\r\nseventeen of the societies drew together to form the National Council\r\nof Colliery Workers other than Miners, for the purpose of maintaining\r\ntheir separate influence.\r\n\r\nIn the railway service, as we have already described, the merging in\r\nthe Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, first of the Scottish\r\nSociety in 1892, and then of the General Railway Workers’ Union, and\r\nthe United Signalmen and Pointsmen’s Society in 1913, made possible the\r\nestablishment of the National Union of Railwaymen on the basis of an\r\norganisation co-extensive with the industry, with the embodiment in the\r\nconstitution of sectional representation. The four “departments” into\r\nwhich the members are divided vote separately in the elections. Under\r\nthese provisions the National Union of Railwaymen, though hampered\r\nby the continuance of the separate Associated Society of Locomotive\r\nEngineers and Firemen, has been able to make effective not only its\r\nclaims for higher remuneration, but also its demands for a normal\r\nEight Hours Day, a national system of classification, and national\r\nwage scales for the several grades; though still not its aspirations\r\n(expressed since 1914) to participation in management, or those\r\n(expressed for over a decade) to the elimination from industry of the\r\ncapitalist profitmaker by the scheme of Railway Nationalisation.\r\n\r\nIn other industries, too, the concentration of Trade Union forces\r\nduring the past decade has increasingly taken the form of an\r\namalgamation of rival sectional organisations, sometimes in response\r\nto a demand from the rank and file. Thus the Ship Constructors’ and\r\nShipwrights’ Association, established in 1888, has successfully\r\nabsorbed not only the very old Shipwrights’ Provident Union of London,\r\nbut also all the remaining local Trade Unions of shipwrights that long\r\nlingered in Liverpool, Dublin, etc. The National Amalgamated Furnishing\r\nTrades Association has taken over a number of small societies of French\r\npolishers, gilders, and upholsterers. The United Garment Workers’ Trade\r\nUnion was formed in 1915 by the amalgamation of a number of societies\r\nin the various sections of the tailoring trade; and in 1919 it was\r\nagreed that this, together with the Scottish Society of Tailors and\r\nTailoresses, should be merged in the old Amalgamated Society of Tailors\r\nand Tailoresses, which would then include practically all the organised\r\nworkers in the making of men’s and women’s clothing in Great Britain.\r\nMany small Unions of machine workers, minor craftsmen, and general\r\nlabourers have been absorbed in one or other of the half-a-dozen large\r\nLabour Unions. The Amalgamated Card and Blowing-Room Operatives have\r\ntaken over various small sectional societies in the Cotton trade. In\r\nSheffield thirteen small Unions, catering for different sections of\r\nthe gold and silver workers, joined together in 1910 in the Gold,\r\nSilver, and Kindred Trades Society, which in 1913 absorbed several more\r\nsocieties in this industry. In the autumn of 1919, as we have already\r\nmentioned, six of the sectional societies in the engineering industry\r\ndecided to merge themselves, with the Amalgamated Society of Engineers,\r\nin a new and more gigantic amalgamation with 400,000 members; the\r\nUnited Pattern Makers’ Society, the Electrical Trades Union, and many\r\nsmall and specialised societies of mechanics in iron still standing\r\naloof. In the same month three of the principal Unions of postal and\r\ntelegraph employees united in a single Union of Post Office Workers,\r\nwith 90,000 members. Other amalgamations among small or local\r\nsocieties took place among the Basketmakers, the Block Printers, the\r\nLeather-workers, the Dyers, the various sections in the Pottery Trade,\r\netc.\r\n\r\nSuch amalgamation is greatly obstructed by legal requirements.\r\nDown to 1917 the law demanded that each society desiring to unite\r\nshould ratify the decision by a two-thirds majority not merely of\r\nthose voting, but of the entire membership. Such a poll is almost\r\nimpossible of attainment by Trade Unions, whose members cannot usually\r\nbe individually communicated with, owing not only to their frequent\r\nchanges of residence and the absence of many of them abroad, but also\r\nto the lack, in most cases, of any complete register of addresses. In\r\n1917 the Government at last permitted the passage of an Amending Act\r\nfor which Trade Unionists had often pressed; but even then insisted\r\non any amalgamation being carried, at a 50 per cent poll of the whole\r\nmembership, by at least 20 per cent majority, conditions which make\r\namalgamation everywhere difficult, and in some Unions (such as those\r\nof seamen) quite impossible. In several cases Unions in which the\r\ngeneral opinion has been in favour of amalgamation have failed to get\r\nthe necessary vote. We have already described the ingenious device by\r\nwhich the British Steel Smelters’ Society and the Iron and Steel Trades\r\nConfederation surmounted this difficulty.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, of federations as distinct from amalgamations the Trade\r\nUnion world has a variety more bewildering than ever, some of which\r\nhave already been referred to. We have to note that the Engineering and\r\nShipbuilding Trades Federation, the establishment of which in 1889 we\r\ndescribed in _Industrial Democracy_, has continued in existence, doing\r\nuseful work from time to time in connection with demarcation disputes\r\nand other subjects of inter-union controversy, especially on the\r\nNorth-East Coast, notably contributing also in 1905 to the successful\r\nclaim of the Clyde trades to weekly instead of fortnightly pays,\r\nwhich the employers had stubbornly resisted for a whole decade, but\r\ncontinuing to be weakened by the abstention, except for a few years,\r\nof the Amalgamated Society of Engineers, which, however, now frequently\r\nconsents to act in conjunction with it in general trade questions.\r\n\r\nWhat is significant is the change in type and purpose of these\r\nmultifarious industrial federations, which have now come to form\r\nan important element in the Trade Union world.[632] Federation, in\r\nfact, has undergone a subtle change of character. Instead of loose\r\nalliances for mutual support in disputes, or for the adjustment of\r\nmutual differences as to “demarcation” and transfer of members, the\r\nfederations of all the craft or sectional Unions engaged in particular\r\nindustries--notably those of the Building Trades, the Transport\r\nWorkers, and, though not yet to the same extent, the Printing Trades\r\nand the Woollen Workers, like the older organisation of the Cotton\r\nOperatives--have become increasingly, themselves negotiating bodies,\r\nrecognised by the equally organised employers, and concerting with\r\nthese what are, in effect, national regulations governing their\r\nindustries throughout the whole kingdom. The later development of the\r\nEngineering and Shipbuilding Trades Federation has been in the same\r\ndirection. In the case of the Miners’ Federation of Great Britain\r\nthe development has gone still further; and this great organisation,\r\nwhilst retaining the federal form, and, even now, not completely\r\nadmitted to “recognition” by the Mining Association of Great Britain,\r\nunquestioningly acts for the whole industry in national issues, as\r\nif it were an “amalgamated” Union. Whether or not we are to see all\r\nthe rival and sectional Unions in each industry amalgamating into a\r\nsingle “Industrial Union,” as many Trade Unionists desire, it must be\r\nrecognised that the development, during the past decade, of active\r\nnegotiating federations for the several industries goes far to supply\r\nthe most urgent need. In short, although financially distinct Trade\r\nUnions remain, on the whole, as numerous as ever, the number of\r\nseparate negotiating bodies, so far as concerns matters relating to an\r\nindustry as a whole, becomes steadily smaller.\r\n\r\nWe pass now to federal bodies of a different character.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL FEDERATION OF TRADE UNIONS\r\n\r\nIn 1899, arising out of the losses caused by the costly engineering\r\ndispute of 1897-98, the Trades Union Congress established a General\r\nFederation of Trade Unions, largely at the instance of Robert Knight,\r\nthe able secretary of the Boilermakers, designed exclusively as a\r\nmutual reinsurance agency against the heavy financial burden to which,\r\nin the form of Strike Pay, or Dispute or Contingent Benefit, labour\r\ndisputes subject every active trade society.[633] By means of a small\r\ncontribution from a large aggregate membership (1s. or 2s. per year per\r\nmember), the General Federation is able to recoup to its constituent\r\nsocieties 2s. 6d. or 5s. per week per member affected towards their\r\nseveral expenditures upon disputes. Beginning with 44 societies,\r\nhaving a total membership of 343,000, it steadily increased the number\r\nof its adherents until, in 1913, it had affiliated as many as 150\r\nsocieties, having at that date 884,291 members. Since that time the\r\nnumber of societies has dropped to 141 in 1919; but their increase\r\nin membership had raised the aggregate affiliation to 1,215,107, the\r\nlargest ever recorded. The General Federation, whilst suffering for the\r\npast seven years from an arrest of growth, has to its credit twenty\r\nyears’ success in surmounting the difficulties which have destroyed\r\nevery previous attempt of the kind, and its prudent management is shown\r\nby the fact that it was able, from its normal revenue, to discharge\r\nall its obligations down to 1905, and to accumulate a reserve of\r\n£119,656. In that year the members rashly insisted on a reduction of\r\nthe contribution by one-third, not foreseeing the outburst of disputes\r\nin 1908-9, which caused the Federation to pay out for 638 disputes\r\nno less than £122,778, and necessitated in 1913 the doubling of the\r\ncontribution. Since that date, in spite of payments to societies\r\naveraging £1500 every week of the year, the Federation has not only\r\nmet its engagements, but also built up a reserve exceeding a quarter\r\nof a million sterling. In 1911 it formed an Approved Society under the\r\nNational Insurance Act, with the object of relieving the separate Trade\r\nUnions, and notably the thousand small ones, from the onerous task of\r\nseparately administering the Act, and to ensure that their members did\r\nnot go off to the Industrial Insurance Companies, an effort which has\r\nfailed to attract more than a few thousand members. An extension of\r\nthe effort to the provision of death benefits, by the formation of a\r\nFriendly Society section in 1913, has proved scarcely more successful.\r\n\r\nIt must be recognised that during the past six or seven years the\r\nFederation has lost favour with important sections of the Trade Union\r\nworld. It was probably inevitable that its inclusion of small sectional\r\nsocieties should eventually bring it into conflict with the larger\r\nUnions by whom such societies are often regarded as illegitimate\r\ncompetitors. Grounds of this kind may be assigned for the secession\r\nof the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and the Amalgamated Society\r\nof Tailors in 1915; and for the powerful hostility shown since 1913\r\nby the Miners’ Federation of Great Britain. But this feeling has been\r\naccentuated by a growing resentment of the part played by the General\r\nFederation--not unconnected with the forceful personality of the\r\nGeneral Secretary--first in international relations, and secondly in\r\nthe representation of Trade Union opinion to the Government and to the\r\npublic.\r\n\r\nThe General Federation, from its very establishment, affiliated\r\nitself to the International Trade Union Federation, which aimed at\r\nthe collection and publication of statistics of Trade Unionism all\r\nover the world by an International Trade Union Secretariat, and at\r\nthe mutual interchange of Trade Union information. For the first\r\nfifteen years of its existence this action of the General Federation\r\nwas not objected to, although the fact that it represented only 25\r\nto 30 per cent of British Trade Unionism impaired the value of its\r\nstatistical contributions. The Parliamentary Committee of the Trades\r\nUnion Congress, which might well have undertaken the task, long ignored\r\nits international interests; but during the Great War increasingly\r\nresented the appearance of the General Federation as the representative\r\nof British Trade Unionism, and especially the almost continuous\r\nnegotiations between its secretary, Mr. Appleton, and Mr. Gompers, the\r\nSecretary of the American Federation of Labor, and with M. Jouhaux, the\r\nSecretary of the _Confédération Générale du Travail_ of France, along\r\nlines not consistent with those of the Labour Party and the Trades\r\nUnion Congress. When, in 1918, attempts were made to reconstitute the\r\nInternational Federation of Trade Unions, the Parliamentary Committee\r\nclaimed at first to be itself the representative of Great Britain; but\r\npresently compromised on a joint and equal representation by the two\r\nbodies.\r\n\r\nBut more serious than the question of international representation was\r\nthe resentment at the ever-widening range of subjects at home on which\r\nMr. Appleton, the Management Committee, and the Conferences of the\r\nGeneral Federation claimed to voice the feelings of Organised Labour.\r\nIt was urged that the Federation was formed exclusively for the purpose\r\nof mutually reinsuring Strike Benefit, and that it had accordingly no\r\nmandate, and did nothing but weaken the Trade Union forces, both in the\r\nnarrow field of the conditions of the wage contract, and on the broader\r\nissues of Labour’s political aspirations, whenever it entered into\r\nrivalry with the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress\r\non the one hand, or with the Labour Party on the other. It looks as if\r\nthe General Federation must in future either restrict itself to the\r\nlimited range of its original purpose, or else run the risk of being\r\nfinancially weakened by the secession of influential Trade Unions,\r\nwhich will not permanently remain affiliated to all three national\r\nbodies, when finding these speaking on the same subjects with different\r\nvoices.\r\n\r\n\r\nTRADES COUNCILS\r\n\r\nOf another form of loose federation of the branches of all the Trade\r\nUnions within a given area we have already described the origin and the\r\ndevelopment in the local Trades Councils. These have gone on increasing\r\nin number, much more than in strength, until in 1920 we estimate that\r\nmore than 500 are in existence, with an aggregate affiliated membership\r\nrunning into several millions of Trade Unionists. The character of\r\ntheir active membership, their functions, and their proceedings have\r\nremained much as we described them thirty years ago; but they have,\r\non the whole, increased in strength and local influence, as well as\r\nin numbers and membership. They were, as we shall presently mention,\r\nsomewhat arbitrarily excluded in 1895 from the Trades Union Congress,\r\nof which they were actually the originators; and although they have\r\nsince joined in various provincial federations of Trades Councils,[634]\r\nthese have never acquired any great strength, and do little more than\r\narrange for co-operation in local demonstrations. An attempt to form a\r\nNational Federation of Trades Councils did not succeed. On the other\r\nhand, as we shall describe in Chapter XI., the Trades Councils were,\r\nfrom its establishment in 1900, admitted, equally with Trade Unions,\r\nas constituents of the Labour Representation Committee (now the Labour\r\nParty), and whether as Trades Councils, or (notably with the smaller\r\nones) in their new form of “Trades Councils and Local Labour Parties,”\r\nthey are coming slowly to form its geographical basis. It is more and\r\nmore on the political side that they are in some degree succeeding in\r\nuniting the energies of the Trade Unions of a particular town. This\r\nis especially the case so far as municipal politics are concerned.\r\nThey have, for instance, been the main force in securing the general\r\nadoption of the Fair Wages Clause, and in furthering the election of\r\nLabour Candidates to local governing bodies. But they are rigidly\r\nexcluded from all participation in the government or trade policy\r\nof the Unions; and, so far as Trade Unionism itself is concerned,\r\ntheir direct influence on questions of national scope is not great.\r\nConsisting, as in the main they do, of the delegates elected by\r\nbranches of national societies, they are hampered by the narrow limits\r\nof the branch autonomy. For in trade matters the branch can bring to\r\nthe Council no power which it does not itself possess, whilst towards\r\nany action involving expense by the Council it can, in many Unions,\r\ncontribute only the voluntary extra-subscriptions of its members.\r\nDuring the present century, however, many Unions have started paying\r\nfrom central funds the affiliation fees of their branches to Trades\r\nCouncils. Down to the end of the Nineteenth Century, however, the\r\nresources of the Councils accordingly seldom sufficed for more than the\r\nhire of a room to meet in,[635] the necessary postage and stationery,\r\nand the payment of a few pounds a year for the “loss of time” of their\r\nprincipal officers. In no case except London does a Trades Council as\r\nsuch, even in 1920, pay a “full-time” salary, so as to command the\r\nwhole time of a single salaried official, though the Trades Councils of\r\ncities like Glasgow, Manchester, and Bradford have salaried secretaries\r\nwho have other duties; and where the Trades Council is combined with\r\nthe Local Labour Party it is more and more coming to have the services\r\nof a Registration Officer or Election Agent, whose salary is usually\r\nprovided as part of the election expenses of the Labour candidate.\r\n\r\nFor a long time it could hardly be said that the Trades Councils\r\nenjoyed even the moral support of the great Unions. The central\r\nexecutives of the national societies were apt to view with suspicion\r\nand jealousy the existence of governing bodies in which they were not\r\ndirectly represented. The local branches, if not actually forbidden,\r\nwere not encouraged to adhere to what might conceivably become a rival\r\nauthority. The strong county Unions frequently stood aloof unless they\r\nwere allowed an overwhelming representation. One of the notable changes\r\nof the present century has been the diminution of this jealousy of the\r\nTrades Councils. We know of no case in which branches are now forbidden\r\nto join a Trades Council. In most cases, although permission may have\r\nto be obtained from the Executive Council or Committee, it is nowadays\r\nreadily granted, and with the recognition of the need for political\r\naction, between 1901 and 1913, came positive encouragement to the\r\nbranches to affiliate to the Trades Councils of their localities.[636]\r\n\r\nIt remains, however, true in 1920 as in 1890 that the Trades Councils\r\ndo not include the national leaders of the Trade Union world. The\r\nsalaried officials of the old-established societies seldom take part\r\nin their proceedings. The London Trades Council, for instance, the\r\nclassic meeting-place of the Junta, has long since ceased to be able\r\nto count among its delegates the General Secretaries of the Engineers,\r\nBricklayers, Railwaymen, Steel-smelters, or of any other of the great\r\nSocieties having their head offices in London. The powerful coterie\r\nof cotton officials forms no part of the Manchester Trades Council.\r\nOf the boilermakers, neither the General Secretary nor any one of the\r\nnine District Delegates is usually to be found on a Trades Council.\r\nThe Miners’ Agents are notorious for abstention from the Councils in\r\ntheir localities. This, however, is due nowadays, whatever may once\r\nhave been the reason, principally to the enormous additions to the work\r\nof all the salaried officials of the Trade Union world, which make it\r\nimpossible for the majority of them to attend Trades Council meetings.\r\nThe Trades Councils now serve as a useful training-ground, wider than\r\nthat of the Trade Union Branch, for those whom we have elsewhere\r\ndescribed as the non-commissioned officers of the Movement, from whose\r\nranks nearly all the Trade Union leaders emerge.\r\n\r\nApart from their constant activity in municipal politics, and their\r\nenergetic support of the Labour Party in all elections, the Trades\r\nCouncils have, in the present century, considerably increased in\r\nusefulness. They have given valuable assistance in Trade Union\r\npropaganda, alike within their own districts and in the adjacent rural\r\ndistricts. No small part of the increase in Trade Union membership,\r\nnotably among nondescript workers in the towns, and the agricultural\r\nlabourers in the country, is to be ascribed to the constant work and\r\nsupport of some of the more active among them. They have done much to\r\nappease quarrels among the local branches of different Unions, and they\r\nare occasionally able to intervene successfully as arbitrators.[637]\r\nEven without formal arbitration they bring warring parties together.\r\nThey nominate working-class representatives to many local committees\r\nand conferences, and serve, in this way, as useful links with public\r\nadministration. Some of them have, of recent years, done a great deal\r\nto promote the better education of the artisan class. They affiliate to\r\nthe Workers’ Educational Association or the Labour College, and support\r\nits classes; they arrange public meetings and obtain outside speakers;\r\nthey affiliate to the Labour Research Department, which has a special\r\n“Trades Councils and Local Labour Parties Section”; they subscribe to\r\nthe travelling library of book-boxes maintained by the Fabian Society;\r\nthey frequently issue their own monthly bulletin of Trade Union and\r\nLabour news, or journal of local government information, or at least\r\ntheir annual _Year-Book_; and they act as distributing centres for the\r\nnationally published pamphlets and leaflets--sometimes even for the\r\nmore popular books on Labour questions.[638] They have come, in several\r\ncentres, to form, by Joint Councils, an indispensable connecting link\r\nbetween the Trade Union and Co-operative Movements, and they serve,\r\nmore than any other agency, as the cement between the local branches of\r\nthese two movements and the Labour Party itself. To what extent they\r\nare destined, in their character of constituent members of the Labour\r\nParty, sometimes actually combined with Local Labour Parties (in the\r\nlatter cases with the inclusion, since 1918, of a section of individual\r\nmembers, Trade Unionists or others, “workers by hand or by brain”),\r\nto develop an effective political organisation, drawing together the\r\nwhole of the supporters of the Labour Party in each Parliamentary\r\nconstituency, remains yet to be demonstrated.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRADES UNION CONGRESS\r\n\r\nBut the most extensive federation of the Trade Union world is to-day,\r\nas it has always been, the Trades Union Congress, which could count in\r\nSeptember 1919 an affiliated membership of more than five and a quarter\r\nmillions, a number never paralleled in this or any other country. We\r\nhave described in previous chapters the origin and development of this\r\nfederal body, its uses in drawing together the scattered Trade Union\r\nforces, and its failure either to help in the solution of the problems\r\nof industrial organisation or to give an intellectual lead to the rank\r\nand file.[639]\r\n\r\nWe drew attention in the first edition of this book in 1894 to the\r\nweakness of the organisation of this imposing annual Congress; and,\r\nfrom 1895 onward, certain changes have been successively made in its\r\nconstitution and procedure, not always, as we think, for the better.\r\nAt the Norwich Congress in 1894 the Parliamentary Committee, which the\r\nCongress annually elects as its executive, was charged by a resolution\r\nproposed by W. J. Davis to consider the amendment of the Standing\r\nOrders, and to make the amended orders applicable to the next Congress.\r\nOn the authority of this ambiguous resolution, which seems to have had\r\nin view only the establishment of Grand Committees to deal with the\r\nmultiplicity of resolutions on the annual agenda, the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee, of which the Chairman was then John Burns, M.P., decided\r\nforthwith to expel all the Trades Councils from the Congress, to\r\nmake obligatory the “vote by card” according, not to the number of\r\ndelegates, but to the aggregate membership of each Union, and to\r\nconfine the delegates rigidly to the contemporary salaried officers and\r\nthe members of Trade Unions actually working at their crafts--thereby\r\nexcluding not only the veteran Henry Broadhurst, M.P., with John Burns\r\nhimself, but also Keir Hardie, Tom Mann, and other leaders of the new\r\nmovement that was seeking to make Trade Unionism a political force.\r\nWho, exactly, was responsible for this _coup d’état_ was not officially\r\nrevealed. It was said, with some authority, that James Mawdsley, the\r\nrough and forceful secretary of the Cotton-spinners, was at the bottom\r\nof the move, and that he made use of the personal rivalry between Henry\r\nBroadhurst and John Burns to get them both, and also the rebellious\r\nelement from the Trades Councils, which all three disliked, excluded\r\nfrom future Congresses.[640] The Congress at Cardiff in 1895 was\r\nvery angry, and, in effect, rebuked the Parliamentary Committee, but\r\nallowed the new Standing Orders to be confirmed on the newly adopted\r\n“card vote.” In so far as the intention was to keep the new ideas out\r\nof Congress, the result was plainly a failure, as within four years\r\n(to be described in Chapter XI.) there was a majority in Congress\r\nfor the creation of the independent organisation entitled the Labour\r\nRepresentation Committee, which became in due course the present Labour\r\nParty. The effect was merely to weaken the intellectual influence on\r\nthe Trade Union world of the Congress and its Parliamentary Committee.\r\n\r\nWith this exception of the exclusion of the Trades Councils, and of the\r\noutstanding personalities whom they occasionally sent as delegates,\r\nthe visitor to the Trades Union Congress in 1919 would have found very\r\nlittle difference between it and the Congresses of thirty years before,\r\nexcept for an increase in the size of the gathering and in the number\r\nof members represented; and, as must be added, an all-round improvement\r\nin the education and manners, especially of the younger delegates. As\r\nan institution it can hardly be said to have shown, between 1890 and\r\n1917 at least, any development at all.\r\n\r\nIt must be admitted that, with all its shortcomings, the Congress,\r\nwhich has now for over fifty years continued to meet annually in some\r\nindustrial centre, serves many useful purposes. It is, to begin with,\r\nan outward and visible sign of that persistent sentiment of solidarity\r\nwhich has throughout the whole of the past century distinguished the\r\nworking class. Composed of delegates from all the great national and\r\ncounty Unions and an increasing number of local societies, and largely\r\nattended by the salaried officials, the Congress, unlike the Trades\r\nCouncils, is really representative (except for the absence of most\r\nof the political side of its organisation) of all the elements of the\r\nTrade Union world. Hence its discussions reveal, both to the Trade\r\nUnion Civil Service and to party politicians, the movement of opinion\r\namong all sections of Trade Unionists, and, through them, of the great\r\nbody of the wage-earners. Moreover, the week’s meeting gives a unique\r\nopportunity for friendly intercourse between the representatives of the\r\ndifferent trades, and thus leads frequently to joint action or wider\r\nfederations. Nevertheless the Congress remains, as we have described it\r\nin its early years, rather a parade of the Trade Union forces than a\r\ngenuine Parliament of Labour.[641]\r\n\r\nAll the incidental circumstances tend to accentuate the parade\r\nfeatures of Congress at the expense of its legislative capacity. The\r\nMayor and Corporation of the city in which it is held are frequently\r\npermitted to give a public welcome to the delegates, and to hold a\r\nsumptuous reception in their honour. The Strangers’ Gallery is full\r\nof interested observers, Distinguished foreigners, representatives of\r\nGovernment departments, “fraternal delegates” from America and the\r\nContinent, and from the Co-operative Union and the National Union of\r\nTeachers, inquisitive politicians, and popularity-hunting ministers\r\nsit through every day’s proceedings. The press-table is crowded with\r\nreporters from all the principal newspapers of the kingdom, whilst\r\nthe local organs vie with each other in bringing out special editions\r\ncontaining verbatim reports of each day’s discussions. But what more\r\nthan anything else makes the Congress a holiday demonstration instead\r\nof a responsible deliberative assembly is its total lack of legislative\r\npower. The delegates are well aware that Congress resolutions on\r\n“subjects” have no binding effect on their constituents, and therefore\r\ndo not take the trouble to put them in practicable form, or even to\r\nmake them consistent one with another. From the outset the proceedings\r\nare unbusiness-like. Much of the first day is consumed in pure routine\r\nand a lengthy inaugural address from the President, who has been\r\nsince 1900 always the Chairman of the Parliamentary Committee of\r\nthe preceding year. The rest of the agenda consists of resolutions\r\nsent in by the various Unions and brought higgledy-piggledy before\r\nthe Congress in an order determined by the chances of the ballot.\r\nThese resolutions are subjected to no selection or revision beyond an\r\nattempt by subcommittees to merge in one the several proposals on each\r\nsubject. The delegates have at their disposal about twenty-five hours\r\nto discuss every imaginable subject, ranging from the nationalisation\r\nof the means of production down to the prohibition of one carter\r\ndriving two vehicles at a time. To enable even a minority of those\r\npresent to speak for or against the proposals, each speaker is limited\r\nto five, or perhaps to three minutes, a rule which is more or less\r\nrigidly enforced. But, in spite of this vigorous application of the\r\nclosure, the President is seldom able to get the business through,\r\nand has frequently as much as he can do to maintain order. The\r\nStanding Orders Committee is entirely taken up with its mechanical\r\nbusiness, and is not authorised, any more than is the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee itself, to formulate a programme for the consideration of\r\nthe delegates. Nor does the Congress receive much guidance from\r\nexperienced officials of the old-established Unions. Whether from a\r\ngood-natured desire to let the private members have their turn at\r\nfiguring in the newspapers, or from a somewhat cynical appreciation\r\nof the fruitlessness of Congress discussions, many of them habitually\r\nlie low, and seldom speak except to defend themselves against attacks.\r\nMoreover, they are busily engaged, both in and out of Congress hours,\r\nin arranging for the election of themselves or their friends on the\r\nParliamentary Committee, which has hitherto always been governed by\r\nmutual “bargaining” for votes.[642] When the four days’ talk draws near\r\nto an end, many of the resolutions on the agenda are still undisposed\r\nof. On the Saturday morning, when most of the delegates have started\r\nfor home, a thin meeting hurries rapidly through the remainder of\r\nthe proposals, speeches are reduced to sixty seconds each, and the\r\nCongress adopts a score of important resolutions in a couple of hours.\r\nFrom first to last there is no sign of a “Front Bench” of responsible\r\nleaders. As a business meeting the whole function of the Congress is\r\ndischarged in the election of the Parliamentary Committee, to which\r\nthe representation of the Trade Union world for the ensuing year is\r\nentrusted.\r\n\r\nIn the first edition of this book, in 1894, we gave a description of\r\nthe work of the Parliamentary Committee which it is interesting to\r\nrecall:\r\n\r\n The duties of the Parliamentary Committee have never been\r\n expressly defined by Congress, and it will easily be\r\n understood that resolutions of the kind we have described\r\n afford but little guidance for practical work. But there is\r\n a general understanding that the Committee is to watch over\r\n the political interests of its constituents, in much the\r\n same way as the Parliamentary Committee of a town council\r\n or a railway company. It is obvious that, in the case of\r\n the Trade Union world, such a mandate covers a wide field.\r\n The right of Free Association, won by Allan, Applegarth,\r\n Odger, and their allies, is now a past issue, but the Trade\r\n Union interest in legislation has, with the advance of\r\n Democracy, extended to larger and more complicated problems.\r\n The complete democratisation of the political machinery,\r\n the duty of the Government to be a model employer,\r\n the further regulation of private enterprise through\r\n perfected factory legislation, the public administration\r\n of monopolies, are all questions in which the Trade Union\r\n world of to-day considers itself keenly interested. To\r\n these distinctly labour issues must be added such interests\r\n of the non-propertied class as the incidence of taxation,\r\n the public provision for education and recreation, and the\r\n maintenance of the sick and the aged. We have here an amount\r\n of Parliamentary business far in excess of that falling upon\r\n the Parliamentary Committee of any ordinary town council or\r\n railway company. To examine all bills, public or private,\r\n introduced into Parliament that may possibly affect any of\r\n the foregoing Trade Union interests; to keep a constant\r\n watch on the administration of the public departments; to\r\n scrutinise the Budget, the Education Code, and the Orders\r\n of the Local Government Board; to bring pressure to bear on\r\n the Ministry of the day, so as to mould the Queen’s Speech\r\n into a Labour Programme; to promote independent Bills on all\r\n the subjects upon which the Government refuses to legislate;\r\n and, lastly, to organise that persistent “lobbying” of\r\n Ministers and private members which finally clinches a\r\n popular demand--all this constitutes a task which would tax\r\n the energies of half a dozen highly trained Parliamentary\r\n agents devoting their whole time to their clients. This\r\n is the work which the Trade Union Congress delegates\r\n to a committee of busy officials, all absorbed in the\r\n multifarious details of their own societies, and served only\r\n by a Secretary who is paid for a small part of his time, and\r\n who accordingly combines the office with other duties.[643]\r\n\r\n The whole organisation is so absurdly inadequate to the\r\n task, that the Committee can hardly be blamed for giving up\r\n any attempt to keep pace with the work. The members leave\r\n their provincial headquarters fifteen or twenty times a year\r\n to spend a few hours in the little offices at 19 Buckingham\r\n Street, Strand, in deliberating upon such business as their\r\n Secretary brings before them. Preoccupied with the affairs\r\n of their societies, and unversed in general politics, they\r\n either confine their attention to the interests of their\r\n own trades, or look upon the fortnightly trip to London as\r\n a pleasant recreation from hard official duties. In the\r\n intervals between the meetings the Secretary struggles with\r\n the business as best he can, with such clerical help as he\r\n can afford to pay for out of his meagre allowance. Absorbed\r\n in his own Parliamentary duties, for the performance of\r\n which his constituents pay him a salary, he can devote\r\n to the general interests of the Trade Union world only\r\n the leavings of his time and attention. It is therefore\r\n not surprising to learn that the agenda laid before the\r\n Parliamentary Committee, instead of covering the extensive\r\n field indicated by the resolutions of the Congress, is\r\n habitually reduced to the barest minimum. The work annually\r\n accomplished by the Committee during the last few years\r\n has, in fact, been limited to a few deputations to the\r\n Government, two or three circulars to the Unions, a little\r\n consultation with friendly politicians, and the drafting\r\n of an elaborate report to Congress, describing, not their\r\n doings, but the legislation and other Parliamentary\r\n proceedings of the session. The result is that the executive\r\n committee of the United Textile Factory Workers’ Association\r\n and the Miners’ Federation exercised a far more potent\r\n influence in the lobby than the Committee representing the\r\n whole Trade Union world; whilst such expert manipulators as\r\n Mr. John Burns, Mr. Havelock Wilson, or Mr. George Howell,\r\n can point to more reforms effected in a single session than\r\n the Parliamentary Committee has lately accomplished during a\r\n whole Parliament.\r\n\r\n It is therefore not surprising that there exists in the\r\n Trade Union world a growing feeling of irritation against\r\n the Parliamentary Committee. In each successive Congress\r\n the Committee, instead of taking the lead, finds itself\r\n placed on its defence. But it is obvious that Congress\r\n itself is to blame. The members of the Committee, including\r\n the Secretary, are men of quite as sterling character and\r\n capacity as a board of railway directors or a committee\r\n of town councillors. But whereas a railway company or a\r\n town council places at the disposal of its Parliamentary\r\n Committee the whole energies of a specially trained town\r\n clerk or solicitor, and allows him, moreover, to call to\r\n his aid as many expert advisers as he thinks fit, the\r\n Trades Union Congress expects the Parliamentary affairs of\r\n a million and a half members to be transacted by a staff\r\n inferior to that of a third-rate Trade Union. At one period,\r\n it is true, the leaders of the Trade Union world as a whole\r\n successfully conducted a long and arduous Parliamentary\r\n campaign. We have described in a previous chapter the\r\n momentous legislative revolution in the status of Trade\r\n Unionism which was effected between 1867 and 1875. But the\r\n Conference of Amalgamated Trades, and its successors the\r\n Parliamentary Committee, had in these years at their command\r\n the freely given services of such a galaxy of legal and\r\n Parliamentary talent as Mr. Frederic Harrison, Professor\r\n E. S. Beesly, Mr. Henry Crompton, Mr. Thomas (now Judge)\r\n Hughes, Messrs. Godfrey and Vernon Lushington, and Mr. (now\r\n Justice) R. S. Wright. The objection felt by the present\r\n generation of Trade Unionists to be beholden to middle-class\r\n friends is not without a certain validity. But if the Trade\r\n Union Congress wants its Parliamentary business done it\r\n must, at any rate, provide such a salary as will secure the\r\n full services of the ablest man in the movement, equip his\r\n office with an adequate number of clerks, and authorise the\r\n Parliamentary Committee to retain such expert professional\r\n assistance as may from time to time be required.\r\n\r\nSuch was the position as we saw it in 1894. The Trades Union Congress\r\ndid not in any important respect improve its organisation, nor equip\r\nits Parliamentary Committee with any adequate staff. Its failure to\r\ncope with the Parliamentary business in which the Trade Union world\r\nwas interested became more and more manifest; and the discontent was\r\nincreased by the disinclination felt by many of the leading members of\r\nthe Committee for the larger aspirations and more independent attitude\r\nin politics that marked the active spirits of the rank and file of\r\nTrade Union membership. All this co-operated to produce the vote of\r\nthe 1899 Congress in favour of some definite step to increase the\r\nnumber of Labour Members in the House of Commons, out of which sprang\r\nthe independent organisation subsequently known as the Labour Party,\r\nwhich we shall describe in Chapter XI. But although the Trades Union\r\nCongress thus created, at the very end of the nineteenth century, a\r\nseparate political organisation for the Trade Union world, into which\r\nthe steadily increasing political activity of the Trade Unions has\r\nsince flowed, the Congress and its Parliamentary Committee made no\r\nchange in their own work. There has accordingly continued to be the\r\nsame stream, year after year, of miscellaneous resolutions before\r\nCongress, 99 per cent of them dealing with political issues, involving\r\neither legislation or a change of Government policy, resolutions which\r\nhave continued to be presented and discussed without any regard to\r\ntheir place in any consistent programme for the Trade Union world as\r\na whole. The Parliamentary Committee has continued to regard itself\r\nalmost entirely as a Parliamentary Committee, just as if the Trade\r\nUnions had not united in a distinct political organisation and had\r\nnot created their own Parliamentary Labour Party. The futile annual\r\ndeputations to Ministers have continued to present to them the crude\r\nresolutions of the Trades Union Congress, without regard to the\r\ncontemporary situation in the House of Commons, or the action taken by\r\nthe Parliamentary Labour Party, and without taking into account in what\r\nrelation they stand to the political programme of the Trade Union world\r\nas formulated, year by year, in the Conferences of the Labour Party.\r\nMeanwhile the essentially industrial work of the national organisation\r\nof Trade Unions has continued to be neglected. Both the Trades Union\r\nCongress and the Parliamentary Committee have shown the greatest\r\ndisinclination to tackle such essentially Trade Union problems as\r\nthose presented by the existence in the same trade of competing Trade\r\nUnions;[644] by the formation of separate Unions on overlapping and\r\nmutually inconsistent bases; by the growing rivalry between the warring\r\nconceptions of organisation by craft and organisation by industry; by\r\nthe increasing failure of the membership of each branch to correspond\r\nwith the staffs of the separate gigantic establishments characteristic\r\nof the present day; by the “rank and file movement,” demanding a\r\ngreater direct control of workshop conditions than can easily be\r\nmade compatible with the centralisation of policy in the national\r\nexecutives; by the development of the “Shop Stewards’” organisation;\r\nby the spread in different industries of systems of “payment by\r\nresults,” unsafeguarded by the necessary adaptations of the Standard\r\nRate and Collective Bargaining; by the tendency of the employers to\r\nmake deductions from the Standard Rate when it suits them to take on\r\nindividuals or new classes of workers whom they declare to be inferior,\r\nwhether women or boys, old men or partially incapacitated workers of\r\nany sort; and by the introduction of “Scientific Management.”[645]\r\n\r\nDuring the whole of this century, in fact, the Parliamentary Committee\r\nof the Trades Union Congress, and the Congress itself, have failed\r\nto grapple with the work that calls out to be done by some national\r\norganisation of the Trade Union world. After allowing to be created,\r\non the one hand, the General Federation of Trade Unions, abandoning to\r\nit the whole function of insurance, together with the representation\r\nof British Trade Unionism in the International Federation of Trade\r\nUnions, and, on the other, the Labour Party, with its inevitable\r\nabsorption of the political activity of the Trade Union world, the\r\nParliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress has failed to\r\nrecognise, and to concentrate upon, the sphere that it had left to\r\nitself, namely, to become the national organ for the improvement and\r\ndevelopment of British Trade Unionism in its industrial aspect. Whilst\r\nthe Trades Union Congress has continued anxiously and nervously to\r\nabstain from any attempt to demarcate the spheres of rival Unions or\r\nto improve their mutual relations, action which would have brought the\r\nParliamentary Committee dangerously into conflict with one or other of\r\nits constituents, and has confined its attention as much as ever to the\r\nstatutory and governmental reforms which its various sections desired,\r\nit has been progressively overshadowed, on the political side, by the\r\nrise of the Labour Party, to be described in a subsequent chapter.\r\n\r\nTowards the end of 1919 the discontent of the Trade Union world\r\nwith the position and attitude of the Parliamentary Committee came\r\nto a head. The sudden railway strike, described in this chapter,\r\nrevealed the lack of any organ of co-ordination in industrial\r\nmovements which inevitably affected the whole Trade Union Movement.\r\nThe Parliamentary Committee itself laid before a special Trades Union\r\nCongress in December 1919 a report declaring that “the need has long\r\nbeen recognised for the development of more adequate machinery for\r\nthe co-ordination of Labour activities, both for the movement as a\r\nwhole, and especially for its industrial side. Again and again the\r\nlack of co-ordination has resulted, not only in the overlapping of\r\nadministrative work, but also in unnecessary internal and other\r\ndisputes, involving vast financial and moral damage to the whole Labour\r\nMovement. To do away with some of this overlapping and to provide means\r\nof co-ordinating the work of certain sections was the object with which\r\nthe Triple Industrial Alliance was founded by the Miners, Railwaymen,\r\nand Transport Workers, and the same object is behind the numerous steps\r\ntowards closer unity which have been taken in various industries and\r\ngroups. The Negotiating Committee, hastily improvised to deal with the\r\nsituation created by the railway strike this autumn, was generally felt\r\nto have fulfilled, however imperfectly, a vital need of Labour; but it\r\nis clear that it ought not to have been necessary to create a new and\r\ntemporary body to do this work; the necessary machinery should have\r\nbeen already in existence in the form of a really effective central\r\nco-ordinating body for the movement as a whole.\r\n\r\n“It appears to us that the body which is required should and must\r\nbe developed out of the existing organisation of the Trades Union\r\nCongress and out of its closer co-operation with other sections of the\r\nworking-class movement. At present, the Standing Orders do not permit\r\nthe Parliamentary Committee to undertake the work which is required.\r\nIndeed, its functions, as they are now defined, are in great measure a\r\nsurvival from a previous period, when the chief duties of the Congress\r\nwere political, and there existed no separate political organisation\r\nto express the policy and objects of Labour. We accordingly suggest\r\nthat the whole functions and organisation of the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee demand revision, with a view to developing out of it a real\r\nco-ordinating body for the industrial side of the whole Trade Union\r\nMovement. It is also necessary to take into account the relation of the\r\nreorganised Central Industrial Committee to the other sections of the\r\nmovement, and especially to the Labour Party and to the Co-operative\r\nMovement.\r\n\r\n“If a better central organisation could be developed both on the\r\nindustrial side and by the closer joint working with the other wings of\r\nthe working-class movement, a vast development of the very necessary\r\nwork of publicity, information, and research would at once become\r\npossible. The research, publicity, and legal departments now working\r\nfor the movement require co-ordination and extension equally with its\r\nindustrial and political organisation. The research, publicity, and\r\nlegal work now done by the Trades Union Congress, the Labour Party,\r\nand the Labour Research Department must be co-ordinated and greatly\r\nenlarged in close connection with the development of the executive\r\nmachinery of the movement.”\r\n\r\nThe proposal did not secure the approval of the Miners’ Federation, but\r\nthe special Congress, by a very large majority, passed the following\r\nresolution:\r\n\r\n“That in view of the imperative need and demand for a central\r\nco-ordinating body representative of the whole Trade Union Movement and\r\ncapable of efficiently dealing with industrial questions of national\r\nimportance, the Parliamentary Committee be instructed to revise the\r\nStanding Orders of Congress in such manner as is necessary to secure\r\nthe following changes in the functions and duties of the Executive body\r\nelected by Congress:\r\n\r\n “(1) To substitute for the Parliamentary Committee a Trades\r\n Union Congress General Council, to be elected annually by\r\n Congress.\r\n\r\n “(2) To prepare a scheme determining the composition and\r\n methods of election of the General Council.\r\n\r\n “(3) To make arrangements for the development of\r\n administrative departments in the offices of the General\r\n Council, in the direction of securing the necessary\r\n officials, staff, and equipment to secure an efficient Trade\r\n Union centre.\r\n\r\n“Further, in order to avoid overlapping in the activity of\r\nworking-class organisations, the Parliamentary Committee be instructed\r\nto consult with the Labour Party and the Co-operative Movement, with a\r\nview to devising a scheme for the setting up of departments under joint\r\ncontrol, responsible for effective national and international service\r\nin the following and any other necessary directions:\r\n\r\n “(_a_) _Research_: To secure general and statistical\r\n information on all questions affecting the worker as\r\n producer and consumer by the co-ordination and development\r\n of existing agencies.\r\n\r\n “(_b_) _Legal advice_ on all questions affecting the\r\n collective welfare of the members of working-class\r\n organisations.\r\n\r\n “(_c_) _Publicity_, including preparation of suitable\r\n literature dealing with questions affecting the economic,\r\n social, and political welfare of the people; with machinery\r\n for inaugurating special publicity campaigns to meet\r\n emergencies of an industrial or political character.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OFFICERS OF THE TRADE UNION MOVEMENT\r\n\r\nIf we survey the growth of the British Trade Union Movement during the\r\npast thirty years, what is conspicuous is that, whilst the Movement\r\nhas marvellously increased in mass and momentum, it has been marked\r\non the whole by inadequacy of leadership alike within each Union and\r\nin the Movement itself, and by a lack of that unity and persistency\r\nof purpose which wise leadership alone can give. Hence, in our\r\nopinion, the organised workers, whilst steadily advancing, have not\r\nsecured anything like the results, either in the industrial or in the\r\npolitical field, that the individual sacrifices and efforts in their\r\ncause might have brought about. This deficiency in the brain-work of\r\nsuccessful organisation is very marked in the various sections of the\r\nbuilding trades, with their chaos of separate societies, and in the\r\nengineering industry, with its persistence of competing Unions formed\r\non inconsistent bases, its lack of uniformity in Standard Rates, and\r\nits failure to devise any plan of safeguarding Collective Bargaining in\r\nthe various systems of “Payment by Results.” But it has been equally\r\napparent in the incapacity of the Trade Union Movement as a whole to\r\nestablish any central authority to prevent overlapping organisations\r\nand demarcation disputes, and to co-ordinate the efforts of the various\r\nsections of workers towards a higher standard of life and greater\r\ncontrol over the conditions of their working lives. The British\r\nworkmen, it must be said, have not become aware of the absolute need\r\nfor what we may call Labour Statesmanship. They have not yet learnt\r\nhow, either in their separate Trade Unions or in the Labour Movement\r\nas a whole, to attract and train, to select and retain in office, to\r\naccord freedom of initiative to and yet to control, a sufficient staff\r\nof qualified officials capable not merely of individual leadership, but\r\nalso of well devised “team play” in the long-drawn-out struggle of the\r\nwage-earning class for its “place in the sun.” To this constant falling\r\nshort of the reasonably expected achievements is, we think, due the\r\nperpetual see-saw in Trade Union policy: the Trade Unionists of one\r\ndecade relying principally on political action, to the neglect of the\r\nindustrial weapon, whilst those of a succeeding decade, temporarily\r\ndisillusioned with political action, rush wildly into strikes and\r\nneglect the ballot-box. This change of feeling is due each time to the\r\nfailure of the results to come up to expectation. We shall understand\r\nsome of the reasons for this shortcoming if we examine how the Trade\r\nUnion Movement is, in fact, officered.\r\n\r\nThe affairs, industrial and political, of the six million Trade\r\nUnionists, enrolled in possibly as many as fifty thousand local\r\nbranches or lodges (including a thousand independent small local\r\nsocieties), are administered by perhaps 100,000 annually elected\r\nbranch officials and shop stewards. These may be regarded as the\r\nnon-commissioned officers of the Movement; and it is fundamentally\r\non their sobriety and personal integrity, combined with an intimate\r\nknowledge of their several crafts and a steadiness of judgement,\r\nthat the successful conduct of the branch business depends. They\r\ncontinue to work at their trades, and receive only a few pounds\r\na year for all their onerous and sometimes dangerous work. It is\r\nthese non-commissioned officers of the Trade Union army who keep the\r\nTrade Union organisation alive. But they have neither the training,\r\nnor the leisure, nor even the opportunity, so long as they remain\r\nnon-commissioned officers, working at their trades, to formulate a\r\ndetailed policy, or to supply the day-by-day executive leadership to\r\nthe particular Trade Union, or to the Trade Union Movement. For the\r\nwork of translating into action, industrial or political, the desires\r\nor convictions of the whole body of the members, the Trade Union world\r\nnecessarily depends, in the main, on its salaried officers, who devote\r\nthe whole of their time to the service of the Movement, in one or other\r\ncapacity. Such a whole-time salaried staff was slow to be formed. In\r\n1850 it did not exist at all. It probably did not in 1860 number as\r\nmany as a hundred throughout the whole kingdom. In 1892, in the first\r\nedition of this book, we put it approximately at 600. In 1920, with a\r\nfourfold growth in membership, and (under the National Insurance Act) a\r\nvast increase in the office and financial business of the Trade Unions,\r\nwe estimate the total number of the salaried officers of all the Trade\r\nUnions and their federations (not including mere shorthand typists\r\nand office-boys) at three or four thousand, of whom perhaps one-tenth,\r\nin or out of Parliament, are engaged exclusively on election and other\r\npolitical work. But even on the industrial side, Trade Union officials\r\ndiffer considerably in the work they have to do, and the differences in\r\nfunction result in marked varieties of type.\r\n\r\nWe have first the salaried officials of the skilled trades. They are\r\nbroadly distinguished from the officers of the Labourers’ Unions by\r\nthe fact that they are invariably men who have worked at the crafts\r\nthey represent, and who have usually served their society as branch\r\nsecretaries. We may distinguish among them two leading types, the\r\nAdministrator of Friendly Benefits, and the Trade Official.\r\n\r\nTo the type of Administrator of Friendly Benefits, the school of\r\nWilliam Allan, belong most of the General and Assistant Secretaries at\r\nthe head offices of the great Trade Friendly Societies organisations\r\nin which the mass of routine, financial, and other office business has\r\nbecome so great that only the ablest men succeed in rising above it.\r\nOwing to the continued increase in membership of the principal Unions,\r\nto their tendency to amalgamate into larger and larger aggregations,\r\nto the constant extension of friendly benefits, and since 1911 to\r\nthe enormous addition to the work made by the National Insurance\r\nAct, the administrative staffs of the Unions have had to be doubled\r\nand quadrupled. But the Trade Union official of this type, however\r\ngreat may be his nominal position, has, during the past thirty years,\r\ncome to exercise less and less influence on the Trade Union world.\r\nRigidly confined to his office, he becomes in most cases a painstaking\r\nclerk, and rises at the best to the level of the shrewd manager of an\r\ninsurance company. He passes his life in investigating the claims of\r\nhis members to the various benefits, and in upholding, at all hazard of\r\nunpopularity, a sound financial system of adequate contributions and\r\nmoderate benefits. Questions of trade policy interest him principally\r\nso far as they tend to swell or diminish the number of his members in\r\nreceipt of “Out of Work Pay.” He is therefore apt to be more intent on\r\ngetting unemployed members off the books than on raising the Standard\r\nRate of wages or decreasing the length of the Normal Day. For the same\r\nreason he proves a tenacious champion of his members’ rights in all\r\nquarrels about overlap and demarcation of work; and it may happen that\r\nhe finds himself more often engaged in disputes with rival Unions than\r\nwith employers. He represents the most conservative element in Trade\r\nUnion life. On all occasions he sits tight, and votes solid for what he\r\nconceives to be the official or moderate party.\r\n\r\nMore influential in Trade Union politics is the salaried officer of\r\nthe other type. The Trade Official, as we have called him, is largely\r\nthe result of the prevalence, in certain industries, of a complicated\r\nsystem of “Payment by Results.” We have already described how the\r\ncotton lists on the one hand and the checkweigher clause on the other\r\ncalled into existence a specially trained class, which has since been\r\naugmented by the adoption of piecework lists in boot and shoemaking\r\nand other industries. The officers of this type are professionals in\r\nthe art of Collective Bargaining. They spend their lives in intricate\r\ncalculations on technical details, and in conducting delicate\r\nnegotiations with the employers or their professional agents. It\r\nmatters little whether they are the general secretaries of essentially\r\ntrade societies, such as the federal Unions of Cotton-spinners and\r\nCotton-weavers, or the exclusively trade delegates of societies with\r\nfriendly benefits, such as the Steel-smelters, the Boilermakers,\r\nand the Boot and Shoe Operatives. In either case their attention is\r\nalmost entirely devoted to the earnings of their members. Alert and\r\nopen-minded, they are keen observers of market prices, employers’\r\nprofits, the course of international trade, and everything which may\r\naffect the gross product of their industry. They are more acutely\r\nconscious of incompetency, whether in employer or employed, than they\r\ncan always express. Supporters of improved processes, new machinery,\r\nand “speeding up,” they would rather see an antiquated mill closed or\r\nan incompetent member discharged than reduce the Standard Rate. Nor\r\ndo they confine themselves exclusively to the money wages of their\r\nclients. Among them are to be found the best advocates of legislative\r\nregulation of the conditions of employment, and whilst they have during\r\nthe present century fallen somewhat into the background when wider\r\npolitical issues have come to the fore, the elaboration of the Labour\r\nCode during the past fifty years has been due, in the main, to their\r\ndetailed knowledge and untiring pertinacity.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Official, however, has the defects of his qualities. The\r\nenergetic workman, who at about thirty years of age leaves the factory,\r\nthe forge, or the mine, to spend his days pitting his brains against\r\nthose of shrewd employers and sharp-witted solicitors, has necessarily\r\nto concentrate all his energies upon the limited range of his new\r\nwork. As a Branch Secretary, he may have taken a keen interest in the\r\ngrievances and demands of other trades besides his own. Soon he finds\r\nhis duties incompatible with any such wide outlook. The feeling of\r\nclass solidarity, so vivid in the manual working wage-earner, tends\r\ngradually to be replaced by a narrow trade interest. The District\r\nDelegate of the Boilermakers finds it as much as he can do to master\r\nthe innumerable and constantly changing details of every variety of\r\niron-ship, boiler, and bridge building in every port, and even at\r\nevery yard. The Investigator of the National Union of Boot and Shoe\r\nOperatives is often hard put to it to estimate accurately the labour\r\nin each of the thousand changing styles of boots, whilst at the same\r\ntime keeping pace with ever-increasing complexity both of machinery\r\nand division of labour. The Cotton Official, with his bewildering\r\nlists, throws his whole mind into coping with the infinite variety\r\nof calculations involved in new patterns, increased speed, and every\r\nalteration of count and draw and warp and weft. The Miners’ Agents can\r\nseldom travel beyond the analogous problems of their own industry. Such\r\na Trade Official, if he has any leisure and energy left at the end of\r\nhis exhausting day’s work, broods over larger problems, still special\r\nto his own industry. The Secretary of a Cotton Union finds it necessary\r\nto puzzle his head over the employers’ contention that Bimetallism, or\r\na new Indian Factory Act, deserves the operatives’ support; or to think\r\nout some way of defeating the evasions of the law against over-steaming\r\nor of the “particulars clause.” The whole staff of the Boilermakers\r\nwill be absorbed in considering the effect of the different systems\r\nof apprenticeship in the shipyards, or the proper method of meeting\r\nthe ruinously violent fluctuations in shipbuilding. The Miners will be\r\nthinking only of the technical improvement of the conditions of safety\r\nof the mine, or of the way to protect the interests of the hewer in\r\nan “abnormal place.” And the modern Knight of St. Crispin racks his\r\nbrains about none of these things, but is wholly concerned with the\r\nevil of home work, and whether the inspection of small workshops would\r\nbe more rigidly carried out under the Home Office or under the Town\r\nCouncil. It is not surprising, therefore, that the Trade Officials\r\nare characterised by an intense and somewhat narrow sectionalism. The\r\nvery knowledge of, and absorption in, the technical details of one\r\nparticular trade, which makes them such expert specialists, prevents\r\nthem developing the higher qualities necessary for the political\r\nleadership of the Trade Union world.\r\n\r\nIn another class stand the organisers and secretaries of what used\r\nto be called the Labourers’ Unions, and are now styled Unions of\r\nGeneral Workers--a less stable class, numbering in 1892 about two\r\nhundred, and in 1920 possibly ten times as many. In contrast with\r\nthe practice of the old-established societies these officers have\r\nat no time been always selected from the ranks of the workers whose\r\naffairs they administer.[646] In “revivalist” times the cause of the\r\nunskilled workers attracts, from the ranks of the non-commissioned\r\nofficers of other industries, men of striking capacity and missionary\r\nfervour, such as John Burns and Tom Mann, who organised and led the\r\ndock labourers to victory in 1889. But these men regarded themselves\r\nand were regarded more as apostles to the unconverted than as salaried\r\nofficers, and they ceded their posts as soon as competent successors\r\namong their constituents could be found. In the main the unskilled\r\nworkmen have had to rely for officers on men drawn from their own\r\nranks. In not a few cases a sturdy general labourer has proved himself\r\na first-rate administrator of a great national Union. But it was a\r\nspecial drawback to these Unions in the early days of their development\r\nthat the “failures,” who drift from other occupations into the ranks of\r\ngeneral labour, frequently got elected, on account of their superior\r\neducation, to posts in which personal self-control and persistent\r\nindustry are all-important. Nor were the duties of an organiser of\r\nunskilled labourers in old days such as developed either regular\r\nhabits or business capacity. The absence of any extensive system of\r\nfriendly benefits reduced to a minimum the administrative functions\r\nand clerical labour of the head office. The members, for the most\r\npart engaged simply in general labour, and paid by the day or hour,\r\nhad no occasion for elaborate piecework lists, even supposing that\r\ntheir Unions had won that full recognition by the employers which such\r\narrangements imply. On the other hand, the branches of a Labourers’\r\nUnion in those days were, for one reason or another, always crumbling\r\naway; and the total membership was only maintained by perpetually\r\nbreaking fresh ground. Hence the greater part of the organiser’s\r\ntime was taken up in maintaining the enthusiasm of his members, and\r\nin sweeping in new converts. This involved constant travelling, and\r\nthe whirl of excitement implied in an everlasting round of missions in\r\nnon-Union districts. The typical organiser of a Labourers’ Union in\r\n1889-94 approximated, therefore, more closely than any other figure in\r\nthe Trade Union world, to the middle-class conception of a Trade Union\r\nofficial. He was, in fact, a professional agitator. He might be a saint\r\nor he might be an adventurer; but he was seldom a man of affairs.[647]\r\n\r\nDuring the past quarter of a century these Unions of Labourers, which\r\nare now better styled Unions of General Workers, have changed in\r\ncharacter, and are now often huge national organisations of financial\r\nstability, administered by men as competent as any in the Trade\r\nUnion world. Their officers, who have greatly increased in number,\r\nhave elaborated a technique of their own, combining an efficiency in\r\nrecruiting with an effective representation of their members’ case in\r\nnegotiations with the employers, and before arbitration tribunals,\r\nwhich, particularly in such influential bodies as the National Union\r\nof General Workers, the Dock, Wharf and Riverside Labourers’ Union,\r\nthe Workers’ Union and the National Federation of Women Workers,\r\nbrings them much nearer what we have described as the Trade Official\r\nthan the typical labourers’ organiser of 1889. The exclusively women’s\r\nUnions, among which the National Federation of Women Workers is the\r\nonly one of magnitude, have been exceptionally fortunate in attracting\r\nand retaining women of outstanding capacity--good organisers and\r\nskilled negotiators--who have not only obtained for their members a\r\nremarkable improvement in the conditions of employment, but have,\r\nby their statesmanship, won a position of outstanding influence in\r\nthe Trade Union Movement. It is, indeed, important to note that the\r\naccomplished officials of the larger Unions of General Workers, and\r\nnot those of women only, have become aware of a diversity of view\r\nbetween the skilled craftsman with a “vested interest” in his trade,\r\nand the unskilled or, as they prefer to call them, the semi-skilled\r\nor general workers, bent on being considered qualified for any work\r\nwhich the employer has to give. Hence these officials sometimes take a\r\nlarger view of Labour questions than the trade officials of the skilled\r\ncrafts. They tend to be in favour of the amalgamation of separate\r\nsocieties into “One Big Union”; of much more equality of remuneration\r\namong all manual workers; of the “open door” to capacity; of equal\r\nrates for men and women on the same job; and of a levelling up of the\r\nStandard of Life of the lowest section of the workers. This leads them\r\ninstinctively to a co-ordinated use of the industrial and the political\r\nweapons.\r\n\r\nSome of these officials, however, are paid in a manner which may\r\nexercise an adverse influence on their activity. A new method of\r\nremuneration of the officers of a Trade Union has been devised.\r\nIn one case the very able General Secretary of a Union of skilled\r\ncraftsmen, whose services have been in the past most valuable to the\r\ntrade, is reputed to be paid so much per member per annum, and with\r\nthe great increase in membership to be making an income four times\r\nas large as the salaries of the General Secretaries of great Trade\r\nUnions. In another very extensive Union of unskilled and semi-skilled\r\nworkers, practically the whole staff is paid “by results,” the Branch\r\nSecretaries, for instance, by rule retaining for themselves “six per\r\ncent on the contributions, levies and fines received from the members\r\nof the Branch on behalf of, and remitted to, the Chief Office”; and\r\nbeing paid also “a procuration fee of 1s.” for “introducing new\r\nmembers” into the Approved Society; and for the extra work involved\r\nin disputes, a further “6d. when under 25 members are affected, and\r\n1s. for the first 25 or over; 2s. for the first 50; 6d. per 50 or\r\npart thereof afterwards.” This method of remunerating Trade Union\r\nofficials--analogous to that successfully employed by the Industrial\r\nInsurance Companies for their agents--has certain attractions. A fairly\r\nadequate remuneration for the position and work can thus be allotted\r\nto the officer, without its amount being specifically voted by the\r\nmembers or appearing in the accounts in such a way as to offend the\r\nrank and file by a contrast between their weekly wage for manual labour\r\nand the Standard Rate of what is essentially a different occupation.\r\nIt is, however, rightly regarded as a pernicious system. The practice\r\nof “paying by results” is alleged to lead sometimes to reckless\r\nrecruiting, to “in and out” Trade Unionism, and even to wholesale\r\npoaching among the membership of other Unions; and it produces in the\r\nTrade Union world a type of “business man” more concerned for numbers\r\nthan for raising the Standard of Life of the members he has enrolled,\r\nor for co-operation with other Trade Unions for their common ends.\r\n\r\nQuite another type, of more recent introduction, is the Political\r\nOfficer of the Trade Union world. He may be merely the Registration\r\nOfficer or Election Agent serving the local Labour Party and the\r\nLabour Candidate in a particular constituency; he may be simply a\r\nLabour M.P.; he may be the secretary or staff officer of a great Trade\r\nUnion or powerful federation, or, indeed, of the Labour Party itself,\r\ndevoting himself to political functions; he may combine with one or\r\nother of these posts, or some other Trade Union office, that of a\r\nMember of Parliament; but he is distinguished from the typical General\r\nSecretary, Trade Official or Labour Organiser--from one or other of\r\nwhich he has usually developed--by his absorption in the political work\r\nof the Movement, either inside the House of Commons or outside it,\r\nwithin one constituency or in a wider field. He may not always hold\r\na political office. A marked feature of the past decade has been the\r\nfrequency and the amount of the calls upon the time of the Trade Union\r\nleaders who are not in Parliament, for public service in which their\r\nown Unions have no special concern. The Trade Union official has to\r\nserve on innumerable public bodies, nearly always without pay of any\r\nkind, from local Pension or Food or Profiteering Act Committees, or\r\nthe magisterial bench, up to National Arbitration Tribunals, official\r\nCommittees of Enquiry or Royal Commissions. Such a man is perpetually\r\ndevoting hours every day to the consideration and discussion, and\r\nsometimes to the joint decision, of issues of public character, in\r\nwhich it is his special function to represent, not the opinions and\r\ninterests of the particular Trade Unionists by whom he is paid, but\r\nthe opinions and interests of the whole wage-earning class. All this\r\nimportant work, a twentieth century addition to the functions of the\r\nTrade Union staff, and not alone the increasing calls of Parliament,\r\nis tending more and more to the development of what we have called the\r\nPolitical Officer of the movement.\r\n\r\nThese three or four thousand salaried officials of the Trade Union\r\nworld, whatever their several types, and whatever the duties to which\r\nthey are assigned, are, with insignificant exceptions, all selected\r\nin one way, namely by popular election by the whole body of members,\r\neither of their respective Unions, or of particular districts of those\r\nUnions. They are, in the skilled trades, required to be members of the\r\nUnion making the appointment; and in order to gain the suffrages of\r\ntheir fellow-members they must necessarily have made themselves known\r\nto them in some way. They are, accordingly, selected almost invariably\r\nfrom among what we have described as the non-commissioned officers\r\nof the Movement, those who are serving or who have served as Branch\r\nSecretaries, or other local officers. They have thus all essentially\r\nthe same training--a training which has no more reference to the work\r\nof an administrator of Friendly Benefits than to that of a Political\r\nOfficer. What happens is that the popular workman is, by the votes of\r\nhis fellow-workers, taken suddenly from the bench, the forge or the\r\nmine, at any age from 30 to 50, with no larger experience than that of\r\na Branch Official, and put to do the highly specialised work of one\r\nor other of the types that we have described.[648] It is a further\r\ndifficulty that such training and experience that an individual Trade\r\nUnionist may have had, and such capacity as he may have shown, whilst\r\nthey may secure his election to a salaried office, or his promotion\r\nfrom one such office to another, will be held to have no bearing on the\r\nquestion of which office he will be chosen to fill. The popular Branch\r\nSecretary, who has led a successful strike, may be elected as General\r\nSecretary in a head office where his work will be mainly that of the\r\nmanager of an insurance company. The successful Trade Official, expert\r\nat negotiating complicated changes in piecework lists, may find himself\r\nelected as the Union’s candidate for Parliament; and will, in due\r\ncourse, be sent to the House of Commons to deal on behalf of the whole\r\nwage-earning class, with political issues to which he has never given\r\nso much as a thought. The Trade Union secretary, whose daily work has\r\ntrained him to the meticulous supervision of the friendly benefits, may\r\nfind himself perpetually called away from his office to represent the\r\ninterests of Labour as a member of Royal Commissions and Committees of\r\nEnquiry on every imaginable subject.\r\n\r\nWith such imperfect methods of selection for office, and with so\r\ncomplete a lack of systematic training for their onerous and important\r\nfunctions, it is, we think, a matter for surprise that Trade Union\r\nofficials should have won a well-deserved reputation for knowledge and\r\nskill in negotiations with employers. But their haphazard selection\r\nand inadequate training are not the only difficulties that they have\r\nto overcome. Trade Union officials are nearly always overworked and\r\nexpected to become specialist experts in half-a-dozen techniques; they\r\nare exposed to harassing and demoralising conditions of life, and they\r\nare habitually underpaid. The conditions of employment and the terms\r\nof service which the Trade Unions, out of ignorance, impose on those\r\nwho serve them, far from being conducive to efficient administration\r\nand wise leadership, are often disgracefully poor. In November 1919\r\nthe National Union of Railwaymen set a notable example in raising\r\nthe salaries of their two principal officers to £1000 a year each.\r\nBut this is wholly exceptional. Even now, after the great rise in\r\nthe cost of living, the salary of the staff officer of an important\r\nand wealthy Trade Union rarely exceeds £400 or £500 a year, without\r\nany provision for any other retiring allowance than the Union’s own\r\nSuperannuation Benefit of ten or twelve shillings per week, if such\r\na benefit exists at all. The average member forgets that what he has\r\nto compare the Secretary’s salary with is not the weekly wage of the\r\nmanual working members of the Union, but--on the very doctrine of\r\nthe Standard Rate in which they all believe--the remuneration given\r\nby “good employers” for the kind of work that the Secretary has to\r\nperform. When we remember that the modern Trade Union official has to\r\nbe constantly travelling and consorting with employers and officials of\r\nmuch higher standards of expenditure than his own, and when we realise\r\nthe magnitude and financial importance of the work that he performs,\r\nthe smallness of the salary and the lack of courtesy and amenity\r\naccorded to the office is almost ludicrous. The result is that the able\r\nand ambitious young workman in a skilled trade is not much tempted by\r\nthe career, even if he regards it as one of Trade Union leadership,\r\nunless he is (as so many are) an altruistic enthusiast; or unless his\r\nambitions are ultimately political in character. The able young workman\r\nwill both rise more rapidly and enjoy a pleasanter life by eschewing\r\nany ostensible service of his fellow-workmen, and taking advantage\r\nof the eagerness of intelligent employers to discover competent\r\nforemen and managers, nowadays not altogether uninfluenced by the\r\nsub-conscious desire to divert from Trade Unionism to Capitalism the\r\nmost active-minded of the proletariat. Nor does the danger to the Trade\r\nUnion world end with the refusal of some of its ablest young members\r\nto become Trade Union officials. The inferiority of position, alike in\r\nsalary, in dignity and in amenity, to which a Trade Union condemns its\r\nofficers, compared with that enjoyed by men of corresponding ability\r\nand function in other spheres, puts a perpetual strain on the loyalty\r\nof Trade Union officials. They are constantly being tempted away from\r\nthe service of their fellows by offers of appointments in the business\r\nworld, or by Employers’ Associations, or in Government Departments. And\r\nthere are other evils of underpayment. A Trade Union official whose\r\nincome is insufficient for his daily needs is tempted to make unduly\r\nliberal charges for his travelling expenses, and may well find it more\r\nremunerative to be perpetually multiplying deputations and committee\r\nmeetings away from home than to be attending to his duties at the\r\noffice. He may be driven to duplicate functions and posts in order to\r\nmake a living wage. The darkest side of such a picture, the temptation\r\nto accept from employers or from the Government those hidden bribes\r\nthat are decorously veiled as allowances for expenses or temporary\r\nsalaries for special posts, is happily one which Trade Union loyalty\r\nand a sturdy sense of working-class honour have hitherto made it seldom\r\nnecessary to explore. But such things have not been unknown; and their\r\nunderlying cause--the unwise and mean underpayment of Trade Union\r\nofficials--deserves the attention of the Trade Union world.\r\n\r\nWe have so far considered the officials of the Trade Union world merely\r\nas individual administrators. This, indeed, is almost the only way\r\nin which their work is regarded by their members. It is remarkable\r\nhow slow the Trade Union world is to recognise the importance,\r\nto administrative or political efficiency, of the constitution\r\nof a hierarchy, a group or a team. Where a great society has a\r\nsalaried staff of half-a-dozen to a score of officials--under such\r\ndesignations as General Secretary, Assistant Secretaries, President,\r\nMembers of Executive Council or District Delegates, Organisers or\r\nInvestigators--it is almost invariable to find them all separately\r\nelected by the whole body of members, or what is even more destructive\r\nof unity, by different district memberships. We only know of one\r\nexample in the Trade Union world--that of the Iron and Steel Trades\r\nConfederation--in which the responsible Executive Committee itself\r\nappoints the official staff upon which the performance of the work\r\ndepends. All the salaried officers of a Trade Union, whatever their\r\ndesignations or functions, can usually claim to have the same, and\r\ntherefore equal authority, namely, their direct election by the\r\nmembers. This results in the lack of any organic relation not only\r\nbetween the Executive Committee and the District Officers who ought\r\nto be its local agents, but even between the Executive Committee\r\nand the General Secretary and Assistant Secretaries. The Executive\r\nCommittee can shunt to purely routine work a General Secretary whom it\r\ndislikes, and an unfriendly General Secretary can practically destroy\r\nthe authority of the Executive Committee. In some cases the work of\r\nthe office is in practice divided up amongst all the salaried staff,\r\nExecutive Councillors, General Secretary, and Assistant Secretaries\r\nindiscriminately, each man doing his own job in the way he thinks\r\nbest, and any consultation or corporate decision being reduced to a\r\nminimum. There is, in fact, no guarantee that there will be any unity\r\nof policy within an Executive Committee elected by a dozen different\r\ndistricts, or between an Executive Committee and its leading officials,\r\nwho are elected at different times for different reasons. The members\r\nmay choose a majority of reactionary Executive Councillors and\r\nsimultaneously a revolutionary General Secretary. In nearly all Unions\r\nany suggestion as to the desirability of adopting the middle-class\r\ndevice of entrusting a responsible Executive Committee with the power\r\nof choosing its own officers has been resented as undemocratic.[649] In\r\nsome Unions the indispensable amount of unity is secured, not without\r\ninternal friction, by the presence of some dominant personality, who\r\nmay be a secretary or president, or merely a member of the Executive\r\nCommittee. The same drawback is seen in the constitutions of such wider\r\nfederations as the Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party. The\r\nresult is that the Trade Union Movement has not yet evolved anything in\r\nthe nature of Cabinet Government, based on unity of policy among the\r\nchief administrators, nor do we see any approach to the Party System,\r\nwhich in our national politics alone makes Cabinet Government possible.\r\nIt looks as if any Democracy on a vocational basis must inevitably be\r\ndominated by a diversity of sectional interests which does not coincide\r\nwith any cleavage in intellectual opinions. From the standpoint of\r\ncorporate efficiency the drawback is that the sectional divergencies\r\nare always interfering with the formulation and unhesitating execution\r\nof decisions on wider issues, on which it would be advantageous for\r\nthe Movement as a whole, in the interests of all, to have an effective\r\ngeneral will, even if it be only that of a numerical majority.\r\n\r\nFinally, it is a great drawback to the Trade Union world that it\r\npossesses no capital city and no central headquarters even in London.\r\nIts salaried officials, on whom it depends for leadership and policy,\r\nare scattered all over the country. The General Secretaries of the\r\ngreat Trade Friendly Societies and of the Unions of General Workers are\r\ndispersed between London, Manchester, Newcastle, Glasgow, Aberdeen,\r\nLiverpool, and Leicester. The officials of the Cotton Operatives\r\nare quartered in a dozen Lancashire towns, and those of the Miners\r\nin every coalfield. The District Delegates of the Engineering and\r\nShipbuilding Trades and the organisers of the Dockers and the Seamen\r\nare stationed in all the principal ports. We have seen how little\r\nthe Trades Union Congress, meeting once a year for less than a week,\r\nsupplies any central organ of consultation or direction. The meeting\r\nin London, every few weeks, of the two or three dozen members of the\r\nParliamentary Committee and the Executive Committee of the Labour Party\r\nis wholly inadequate for the constant consultation upon policy, the\r\nmutual communication of each other’s immediate projects, and the taking\r\nof decisions of common interest that the present stage of the Trade\r\nUnion Movement requires. Probably no single thing would do so much\r\nto increase the efficiency of the Trade Union world as a whole as the\r\nprovision of an adequate Central Institute and general office building\r\nin Westminster, at which could be concentrated all the meetings of\r\nnational organisations, federations and committees; and which would\r\nmake at any rate possible the constant personal communication of all\r\nthe different headquarters.[650]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[599] It is doubtful whether, in any country in the world, even in\r\nAustralia or Denmark, there is in 1920 so large a proportion of\r\nthe adult male manual workers enrolled in Trade Unions as in the\r\nUnited Kingdom; and--Ireland being still relatively unorganised\r\nindustrially--certainly not so large a proportion as in Great Britain\r\nalone.\r\n\r\nThe Trade Union Movement in Ireland has, apart from the Irish branches\r\nof British Unions, largely concentrated in the Belfast area, little\r\nconnection with that in Great Britain, but its progress during the past\r\nthirty years has been scarcely less remarkable. The Irish railwaymen\r\nhave abandoned their attempts at organisation in an Irish Union, and\r\nhave lately swarmed into the National Union of Railwaymen to the\r\nnumber of over 20,000. The engineers in Ireland, whether at Belfast or\r\nelsewhere, are, to the number of 9000, in the Amalgamated Society of\r\nEngineers and other British Unions. The other great Unions have nearly\r\nall their Irish branches. But the great transformation has been in the\r\nfoundation and remarkable development of the Transport and General\r\nWorkers’ Union, built up by James Connolly and James Larkin, which has\r\nsurvived both its tremendous Dublin strike of 1913 and the loss of both\r\nits leaders, and claims in 1920 over 100,000 members in 400 branches,\r\nbeing half the Trade Unionists in all Ireland. The only other Irish\r\nTrade Unions exceeding 5000 members are the Flax Roughers’ Union,\r\nincluded with other Unions in an Irish Textile Workers’ Federation,\r\nand the Clerical Workers’ Union, together with the Irish Teachers’\r\nSociety, which (unlike the National Union of Teachers in England\r\nand the Educational Institute of Scotland) is frankly affiliated\r\nwith the (Irish) Labour Party. Scores of other Irish Trade Unions\r\nexist, practically all small, local, and sectional in character, and\r\nalmost confined to the ten towns of Dublin, Belfast, Cork, Limerick,\r\nWaterford, Dundalk, Derry, Clonmel, Sligo, and Kilkenny. The total\r\nTrade Union membership in Ireland, which thirty years ago was only put\r\nat 40,000, may now exceed 200,000, about one-fifth of which is in and\r\nabout Belfast. The Irish Trades Union Congress, established in 1894,\r\nand the Irish Labour Party meet annually.\r\n\r\nThe Irish Trade Union Movement, emerging from handicraftsmen’s local\r\nclubs, some of them dating from the middle of the eighteenth century,\r\nand monopolist and sectional in policy, has, during the present\r\ncentury, become fired with nationalist spirit and almost revolutionary\r\nfervour. Its heroes are Michael Davitt, James Connolly, and James\r\nLarkin. The story of the Transport and General Workers’ Union, with its\r\nextraordinary extension to all grades of wage-earners all over Ireland,\r\nand its sensational strikes in Dublin in 1913-14, is an epic in itself.\r\nSome idea of this development may be gathered from _The Irish Labour\r\nMovement_, by W. P. Ryan, 1919; _Labour in Irish History_, by James\r\nConnolly; _Socialism Made Easy_, by the same (about 1905); the Annual\r\nReports of the Irish Trades Union Congress since 1895; and those of the\r\nIrish Labour Party.\r\n\r\n[600] Statistics of aggregate membership in the past are lacking. But\r\nwe suggest that after the transient mass enrolments of 1833-34 had\r\nlapsed, the total membership in Great Britain of such Trade Unions as\r\nsurvived probably did not reach 100,000. It is doubtful whether, as\r\nlate as 1860, there were half a million Trade Unionists. We give in an\r\nAppendix such past statistics as we have found.\r\n\r\n[601] _Industrial Democracy_, pp. 38, 92, 103, 123, 258, etc.\r\n\r\n[602] The Amalgamated Association of Card and Blowing Room Operatives\r\nis (1920) not now a member. A further development of federal complexity\r\nis the formation of a Federation of Kindred Trades connected with the\r\nExport Shipping Industry of Manchester.\r\n\r\nAn invidious feature, in which the textile industry is unique, is the\r\nappearance during the present century, as the result of a quarrel as\r\nto “political action,” of half-a-dozen separate local Trade Unions\r\nof Roman Catholic weavers, which are united in what is termed the\r\nLancashire Federation of Protection Societies. These, which are neither\r\nnumerous nor of extensive membership, remain outside the Amalgamated\r\nAssociation of Weavers; and are watchful critics of any proposals,\r\nat the Trades Union Congress (to which they do not seek admission)\r\nor elsewhere, that offend the Roman Catholic Church (notably any\r\nsuggestion of “Secular Education,” or educational changes deemed\r\ninimical to the Roman Catholic schools). There is a National Conference\r\nof Catholic Trade Unionists having similar objects.\r\n\r\nThere was, in 1919, also a Jewish National Labour Council of Great\r\nBritain; and from time to time Unions are formed, especially in the\r\nclothing trade (such as the Amalgamated Jewish Tailors, Machinists, and\r\nPressers, established 1893), and in baking and cabinetmaking, aiming\r\nat enrolling Jewish workers. But this is not really a religious, or\r\neven primarily a racial, cleavage, but merely sectional organisation,\r\nusually transient, among particular branches of industry which happen\r\nto be principally carried on by Jews. At present most such societies in\r\nthe clothing trade have been absorbed in the United Garment Workers’\r\nTrade Union, which, with upwards of 100,000 members, is actively\r\nnegotiating for a merger with the older Amalgamated Society of Tailors\r\nand Tailoresses (established 1865) and the effective Scottish Operative\r\nTailors’ and Tailoresses’ Association, with 5000 members, under the\r\ntitle of the United Tailors and Garment Workers.\r\n\r\n[603] A recent case in which the Trade Union Assistant Secretary left\r\nthe weavers for the employers, in the midst of a crisis, with the Union\r\naffairs in confusion, was stigmatised as desertion.\r\n\r\n[604] The workers in the woollen and worsted trades, whose organisation\r\nwent to pieces early in the nineteenth century on the extensive\r\nintroduction of women and the successive transformations of the\r\nindustry by machinery, have, during the past thirty years, developed\r\nextensive Trade Unions, which have steadily gained strength. In 1892\r\nwe could count only 18,000 Trade Unionists in the whole industry. In\r\n1920, whilst the National Society of Woolcombers and Kindred Trades\r\nhas 12,000 members and there are strong organisations of wool-sorters,\r\nwarp-dressers, and over-lookers, the General Union of Textile Workers,\r\nestablished in 1881, now includes a membership, in the West of England\r\nas well as in Yorkshire, principally male and female weavers, numbering\r\nmore than 100,000 (_The Heavy Woollen District Textile Workers’ Union_,\r\nby Ben Turner, 1917). During the war these Unions were accorded equal\r\nrepresentation with the employers and with the Government on the Wool\r\nControl Board, by which the Government supplies of wool were “rationed”\r\namong the manufacturers, and the prices fixed.\r\n\r\nIn the dyeing and finishing branch of the textile industry the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Dyers, Bleachers, Finishers, and Kindred\r\nTrades (established 1878), with 30,000 members, has outstripped the\r\nolder National Society of Dyers and Finishers (established 1851;\r\n12,000 members), and has entered into remarkable agreements with the\r\nmonopolist combination of employers. (The Amalgamated Association of\r\nBleachers and Dyers, centred at Bolton, which has over 22,000 members,\r\noccupies a similar leading position as regards the dyeing of cotton\r\ngoods.) A recently formed National Association of Unions in the\r\nTextile Trades seeks to co-ordinate the influence of all the woollen\r\nworkers and dyers, and counts a membership of about 150,000, in 35\r\nsocieties, which are grouped in four sections (“Raw Wool,” “Managers\r\nand Overlookers,” “Textile Workers,” and “Dyers’ Societies”).\r\n\r\n[605] The history of the struggles in the engineering industry may\r\nbe gathered from the monthly _Journal_ of the A.S.E. and the Annual\r\nReports of this and other engineering Trade Unions; from the references\r\nin _Engineering_ and other employers’ periodicals. For the lock-out\r\nof 1897, see also the _Times_ and _Labour Gazette_ for that year, and\r\nalso an anonymous volume, _The Engineering Strike_, 1897. See also for\r\nsome of the points at issue, _Industrial Democracy_, by S. and B. Webb,\r\n1897; _An Introduction to Trade Unionism_, by G. D. H. Cole, 1917, and\r\n_The Works Manager To-day_, by Sidney Webb, 1918.\r\n\r\n[606] The Unions which, along with the A.S.E., ratified the agreement\r\nwere the Steam Engine Makers’ Society, the United Machine Workers’\r\nAssociation, the United Kingdom Society of Amalgamated Smiths and\r\nStrikers, the Associated Brassfounders and Coppersmiths’ Society, the\r\nNorth of England Brass Turners’ Society, and the London United Metal\r\nTurners, Fitters and Finishers, having an aggregate membership of\r\n70,000.\r\n\r\nThe societies which failed to secure ratification on the members’\r\nvote, in some cases merely by the failure to obtain a sufficiently\r\nlarge poll, were the Amalgamated Toolmakers’ Society, the Electrical\r\nTrades Union, the United Brass Founders and Finishers’ Association,\r\nthe Amalgamated Instrument Makers’ Society, the United Pattern\r\nMakers’ Association, the Associated Smiths and Strikers, the National\r\nBrassworkers and Metal Mechanics, the Association of Engineering and\r\nShipbuilding Draughtsmen, and the Scale and Beam Makers’ Society, with\r\nsomething like 100,000 members in the aggregate. Probably some of these\r\nwill take another vote in the near future.\r\n\r\nThe old-established Friendly Society of Ironfounders (35,000 members)\r\ncontinues quite apart, though joining freely in engineering trade\r\nmovements. An unusually protracted national strike in 1919, which is\r\nlikely to end in a compromise, may possibly lead to proposals for\r\ncloser union.\r\n\r\n[607] _Trade Unionism: a New Model_, by R. Page Arnot, 1919; and\r\n_Is Trade Unionism played out?_ 1919, by the same. Some “extremist”\r\nthinkers among workmen have put their hopes of achieving the\r\n“Industrial Democracy” that they desire upon a development of the\r\nShop Stewards’ Movement, which should become, together with a “Works\r\nCommittee,” the instrument of transferring the management of each\r\nundertaking from its present capitalist owners and directors to the\r\nelected representatives of the persons employed. See _The Workers’\r\nCommittee, an Outline of its Principles and Structures_, by J. T.\r\nMurphy (1918), and _Compromise or Independence, an Examination of the\r\nWhitley Report_ (1918), by the same, both published by the Sheffield\r\nWorkers’ Committee.\r\n\r\n[608] The Amalgamated Society of Steel and Ironworkers and the\r\nTin and Sheet Millmen’s Association failed to secure their\r\nmembers’ ratification by vote, whilst the National Association of\r\nBlastfurnacemen withheld its adhesion. These may be expected to adhere\r\nin due course.\r\n\r\n[609] The London dock labourers found themselves in 1911, with an\r\nincreased cost of living and the virtual abandonment of attempts to\r\nimprove their method of employment, little better off than in 1889.\r\nSee _Casual Labour at the Docks_, by H.

In 1913 the Police and Prison\r\nOfficers’ Union was formed by ex-Inspector Symes, and in 1917 it was\r\nreorganised, without securing either recognition or sanction. Cases of\r\n“victimisation” having occurred, there was a sudden strike on August\r\n29, 1918, which was participated in by nearly the whole of the police\r\nin many London divisions. This took the world (and also the criminal\r\npopulation) by surprise; but through good-humoured handling by the\r\nPrime Minister (who received the Executive Committee of the Union and\r\ntold them that “the Union could not be recognised during the war”), the\r\nGovernment persuaded the men promptly to resume their duties, with a\r\ncessation of “victimisation” for joining the Union and a substantial\r\nincrease of pay. When hostilities ceased, the Union expected some\r\nmeasure of official sanction, but none was accorded, and grievances\r\nremained unredressed. On July 31, 1919, a second strike was suddenly\r\ncalled, which resulted in failure, only a couple of thousand men\r\ncoming out in London, and a few hundred in Liverpool, Birkenhead, and\r\nelsewhere, together with a small number of prison warders. At Liverpool\r\nand Birkenhead there was serious looting of shops and public-houses\r\nby turbulent crowds. The authorities stood firm, the Home Secretary\r\nrefusing all sanction for the establishment of a Trade Union in the\r\npolice force and prison staff, and summarily dismissing all the\r\nstrikers, at the same time announcing large concessions in the way of\r\nwages, promotion, and pensions, and conceding, not a Trade Union, but\r\nthe establishment of an elective organisation of the police force, by\r\ngrades, entitled to make formal representations and complaints. This\r\nconcession was embodied in the Police Act, 1919, which explicitly\r\nprohibited to the police either membership of, or affiliation to, any\r\nTrade Union or political organisation. The dismissed policemen were\r\nnot reinstated, but the Government informally assisted some of them to\r\nobtain other employment.\r\n\r\n[615] For the history of the Miners’ Federation of Great Britain and\r\nthe contemporary District Unions, we have drawn on the voluminous\r\nprinted minutes of proceedings and reports which are seldom seen\r\noutside the Miners’ Offices; the various publications of the Labour\r\nDepartment of the Board of Trade (now the Ministry of Labour) and\r\nthe Home Office; _The British Coal Trade_, by H.

Page Arnot (1919).\r\n\r\n[616] The enginemen, boilermen and firemen, colliery mechanics,\r\ncokemen, under-managers, deputies, overmen and other officials,\r\ncolliery clerks and various kinds of surface-workers about the mines\r\nhave all their own Unions, which have greatly developed of recent\r\nyears, and are in many districts not very willing to join the county\r\nminers’ associations, though they often act in conjunction with these.\r\nTheir own federations are referred to on p. 550.\r\n\r\n[617] _The British Coal Trade_ (by H. Stanley Jevons, 1915), p. 599.\r\n\r\n[618] The other railwaymen’s Unions are the Belfast and Dublin\r\nLocomotive Engine-drivers’ and Firemen’s Trade Union, founded in 1872,\r\nand still existing (1920) with a few hundred members; the Associated\r\nSociety of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen, founded in 1880, a\r\npowerful sectional society with 33,000 members, which long maintained a\r\njealous rivalry with the Amalgamated; the Railway Clerks’ Association,\r\nfounded in 1897, remaining very small for a whole decade, absorbing\r\nin 1911 the Railway Telegraph Clerks’ Association, founded 1897, with\r\n85,000 members; the Irish Railway Workers’ Trade Union, founded in\r\n1910, tiny and insignificant; the National Union of Railway Clerks,\r\nformed in 1913, a tiny local body, arising out of the suspension of the\r\nSheffield Branch of the Railway Clerks’ Association, temporary only.\r\n\r\nWe may mention the Scottish Society of Railway Servants, founded in\r\nthe eighteen-eighties, merged in the Amalgamated Society in 1892; the\r\nUnited Signalmen and Pointsmen, founded in 1880, merged in the N.U.R.\r\nin 1913; the General Railway Workers’ Union, founded in 1889, merged in\r\nthe N.U.R., 1913.\r\n\r\nFor the development of Trade Unionism in the railway world, and the\r\nvarious controversies, we have drawn mainly on the numerous reports and\r\nother publications of the Unions themselves; the _Railway Review_ and\r\nthe _Railway Clerk_ (the pleading for the Companies being found in the\r\n_Railway News_, subsequently incorporated in the _Railway Gazette_);\r\n_Trade Unionism on the Railways, its History and Problems_, by G.

T. Layton. This “Green\r\nBook” revealed that 38 per cent received 20s. per week or under, and\r\n49.8 per cent between 21s. and 30s.; with atrocious hours. Attempts\r\nto discredit these statistics were made by the Companies, it being in\r\nparticular constantly suggested that nearly all the 100,000 paid under\r\n£1 per week were boys. It took the Board of Trade four years to compile\r\nand publish an official wage-census for October 1907, which eventually\r\nrevealed that 96,000 adult railwaymen were receiving 19s. per week or\r\nless (Board of Trade Report, February 1912), an extraordinarily exact\r\nconfirmation of the much-abused census taken by the Union. See _Men and\r\nRails_, by Rowland Kenney, 1913.\r\n\r\n[622] This intimation undoubtedly meant that the Government had\r\ndecided, as the _Times_ expressly said, to use the Royal Engineers to\r\nrun trains--a decision to be compared with that at once announced in\r\nthe national railway strike of 1919, that no use would be made of the\r\ntroops actually to run trains, nor would the Post Office officials\r\nbe asked to do railwaymen’s work, nor persons on State Unemployment\r\nBenefit be called upon to accept employment on the railways. The change\r\nin attitude of the Government in eight years is significant.\r\n\r\n[623] The committee consisted, for the first time, of equal numbers\r\nof persons appointed as being representative of employers and workmen\r\nrespectively--two on each side--none of them directly concerned with\r\nthe industry, with an “impartial chairman,” all five being selected by\r\nthe Government. For the Companies, Sir T. Ratcliffe Ellis and Mr. C.\r\nG. Beale; for the workmen, Mr. Arthur Henderson, M.P., and Mr. John\r\nBurnett; the Chairman was Sir David Harrel, K.C.B., an official of the\r\nIrish Government.\r\n\r\n[624] The Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen,\r\nhaving now 51,000 members, unfortunately stood aloof; and the annals\r\nof railway Trade Unionism were, down to 1918, largely made up of the\r\nwrangling between this society and the National Union of Railwaymen.\r\n\r\n[625] The mechanics and labourers in the railway companies’ engineering\r\nand repairing shops, though many of them have always been members\r\nof the various engineering and other craft Unions, long remained\r\nrelatively unorganised. Many of the less skilled were enrolled by the\r\nGeneral Railway Workers’ Union in 1889-1913; and when this was merged\r\nin the National Union of Railwaymen, with its broadened constitution,\r\nmany more of the mechanics and labourers in the railway workshops\r\nwere recruited, and the N.U.R. sought to obtain for them the advances\r\nand other benefits for which it was pressing. The railway companies\r\ndisputed the right of the N.U.R. to speak for the “shopmen,” and the\r\nclaim provoked the resentment of the craft Unions, which were now\r\npaying increased attention to the organisation of men of their crafts\r\nin the railway workshops. Repeated attempts have been made to arrive\r\nat some “line of demarcation” or other compromise, by which this\r\nrivalry between Unions could be brought to an end; but hitherto without\r\nsuccess. The quarrel is inflamed by a conflict of Trade Union doctrine.\r\nThe engineers, boilermakers, carpenters, and other trades assert that\r\norganisation should be by craft, whatever may be the industry in which\r\nthe craftsman is working. The advocates of the “New Model” of the\r\nN.U.R. assert the superiority of organisation by industry, including in\r\neach industry all the crafts actually concerned. See _Trade Unionism on\r\nthe Railways, its History and Problems_, by G. D. H. Cole and R. Page\r\nArnot, 1917.\r\n\r\n[626] The Presidential Address at the Annual Conference of the Railway\r\nClerks’ Association in 1913 had suggested that the representatives of\r\nthe railway workers should constitute one-third of a National Railway\r\nBoard--a proposal that did not content the larger Union.\r\n\r\n[627] It was reported that in some cases the soldiers fraternised with\r\nthe pickets and were promptly withdrawn to barracks; and the Cabinet\r\nwas certainly warned, by high military authority, against attempting to\r\nuse the troops.\r\n\r\n[628] For an account of this Department see pp. 571-2.\r\n\r\n[629] A notable feature was a revolt of the compositors and printers’\r\nassistants, who threatened to strike and stop the newspapers altogether\r\nunless the railwaymen were allowed to present their case and unless\r\nabusive posters were abandoned.\r\n\r\n[630] _Railway Dispute, 1919: Report to the Labour Movement of Great\r\nBritain by the Committee appointed at the Caxton Hall Conference_\r\n(National Transport Workers’ Federation).\r\n\r\n[631] British Trade Unionism has often been contrasted, to its\r\ndisadvantage, with the more scientifically classified German Trade\r\nUnionism before the Great War. It was, for instance, often pointed\r\nout that the three millions of German Trade Unionists were grouped in\r\nno more than 48 Unions. This, however, ignored the numerous competing\r\nHirsch-Duncker and Christian Unions, which were far more destructive\r\nof unity than are the crowd of minor societies in Great Britain and\r\nIreland. At present (1920) the 48 largest Trade Unions of this country\r\nconcentrate a larger membership than the much-praised 48 Trade Unions\r\nof Germany did in 1914.\r\n\r\n[632] See _An Introduction to Trade Unionism_, by G. D. H. Cole, 1917.\r\n\r\n[633] See the _History of the British Trades Union Congress_ (by W. J.\r\nDavis), vol. ii. (1916), p. 156; and the successive _Annual Reports_ of\r\nthe General Federation of Trade Unions from 1900 onward.\r\n\r\n[634] Such as those for Kent, Lancashire and Cheshire, North Wales, the\r\nSouth-Western Counties, and Yorkshire.\r\n\r\n[635] At Nottingham, Leicester, Brighton, Hanley, Manchester,\r\nWorcester, and some other towns, the Trades Council has at times\r\nbeen allowed the use of a room in the Town Hall, or other municipal\r\nbuilding. The Local Government Board in 1908 suggested to Local\r\nAuthorities that this assistance should be generally afforded to them.\r\n\r\n[636] One of the most active supporters of the Trades Council\r\nMovement is the National Union of Railwaymen, which has been largely\r\nresponsible for the valuable help rendered by the Trades Councils in\r\nthe organisation of agricultural labourers. The Amalgamated Union of\r\nCo-operative Employees, that of Operative Bakers of Great Britain and\r\nIreland, and the Municipal Employees’ Association are also outstanding\r\nsupporters of the Trades Councils, whilst the Oldham Operative\r\nCotton-spinners, and the Operative Lace Makers of Nottingham make\r\nbranch affiliation compulsory. In many of the principal Unions branch\r\naffiliation fees are contributed wholly, or in large proportion, from\r\nCentral Funds.\r\n\r\n[637] The Manchester Trades Council, and especially its Chairman, Mr.\r\nPurcell, of the Amalgamated Furnishing Trades Association, successfully\r\nbrought to a compromise the very serious strike of the Amalgamated\r\nUnion of Co-operative Employees against the Lancashire and Yorkshire\r\nCo-operative Societies in 1919.\r\n\r\n[638] The Gateshead Trades Council and Local Labour Party holds\r\nan “Information Bureau meeting” once a week, devoted to answering\r\ninquiries and affording information on Local Government affairs.\r\n\r\n[639] The Trades Union Congress has, since 1873, published a long and\r\ndetailed _Annual Report_; and the Parliamentary Committee has, for some\r\nyears past, issued a _Quarterly Circular_ to its constituent bodies.\r\nBesides these, there should be consulted the _History of the British\r\nTrades Union Congress_, by W. J. Davis, of which two volumes have been\r\nissued (1910 and 1916); _Henry Broadhurst, the Story of his Life_, by\r\nhimself, 1901.\r\n\r\n[640] See the significant comments in _History of the British Trades\r\nUnion Congress_, by W. J. Davis, vol. ii., 1916, pp. 102-8.\r\n\r\n[641] In the early period of its history the middle-class friends of\r\nTrade Unionism read papers and took part in debates. But for many\r\nyears no one has been allowed to participate in its proceedings in\r\nany capacity except duly elected delegates who have worked at the\r\ntrade they represent, or are actually salaried officials of affiliated\r\nTrade Unions. In 1892 and 1893 admission was further limited to those\r\nsocieties which contributed a specified amount per thousand members\r\nto the funds of the Congress. The Parliamentary Committee consists of\r\nseventeen members, elected by ballot of the whole of the delegates\r\non the fifth day of the Congress. The successful candidates are\r\nusually the salaried officers of the great societies, the Standing\r\nOrders expressly providing that no trade shall have more than one\r\nrepresentative except the miners, who may now have two. The Secretary\r\nreceives, even in 1920, only £500 a year, and the post has nearly\r\nalways been filled by an officer enjoying emoluments for other duties.\r\nFor the last forty years the holder has almost constantly been a\r\nmember of Parliament, with prior obligations to his constituents,\r\nwhich are not always consistent with the directions of his fellow\r\nTrade Unionists; and with onerous Parliamentary duties, which often\r\nhamper his secretarial work. For many years he had to provide whatever\r\nclerical assistance he required; but in 1896 a clerk, and in 1917 an\r\nAssistant Secretary, were added to the staff.\r\n\r\n[642] Each Union casts votes in proportion to its affiliated\r\nmembership, but can divide them as it pleases among the candidates.\r\nBetween 1906 and 1915 the delegates were divided into ten groups of\r\nallied industries, and each group chose its own member. At the 1919\r\nCongress a resolution was carried directing that the election should\r\nhenceforth be by the transferable vote; and it remains to be seen\r\nwhether this will upset the “dickering for votes.”\r\n\r\n[643] The situation was for years further complicated by the fact\r\nthat C. Fenwick, M.P., who in 1890 succeeded Henry Broadhurst in the\r\noffice, was one of the Parliamentary representatives of the Durham\r\nminers, a majority of whom were not in accordance with the decision of\r\nthe Congress on the crucial question of an Eight Hours’ Bill. It was\r\nin vain that Fenwick, with most engaging candour, explained to each\r\nsuccessive Congress that his pledge to his constituents, no less than\r\nhis own opinions, would compel him actively to oppose all regulation\r\nof the hours of adult male labour. The Congress nevertheless elected\r\nhim for four successive years as Secretary to the Parliamentary\r\nCommittee, replacing him only in 1894 by an officer who was prepared\r\nto support the policy of the Congress. This is only another example\r\nof the extraordinary constancy (referred to at p. 471) with which a\r\nworking-class organisation adheres to a man who has once been elected\r\nan officer--a constancy due, as we think, partly to a generous\r\nobjection to “do a man out of his job,” and partly to a deep-rooted\r\nbelief that any given piece of work can be done as well by one man as\r\nanother. Much the same situation has recurred frequently in the record\r\nof the Parliamentary Committee.\r\n\r\n[644] One such case may be mentioned. In 1898 a small Trade Union\r\nof old standing (Co-operative Smiths’ Society, Gateshead) formally\r\ncomplained that the Amalgamated Society of Engineers had allowed its\r\nmembers to take the places of men who had struck. The Parliamentary\r\nCommittee, acting under Standing Order No. 20, appointed three of its\r\nmembers as arbitrators, who, after elaborate inquiry, found the charge\r\nproved, and requested the A.S.E. to withdraw its members from the place\r\nin dispute. The A.S.E. refused to accept the award, and withdrew from\r\nthe Congress (Annual Report of Trades Union Congress, 1899; _History\r\nof British Trades Union Congress_, by W. J. Davis, vol. ii., 1916, pp.\r\n161-62, 165-67).\r\n\r\nAnother case, in 1902, was adjudicated on in a similar way, where\r\nthe United Kingdom Amalgamated Smiths and Strikers complained of the\r\nAssociated Blacksmiths’ Society, which was found to blame (_ibid._ p.\r\n208).\r\n\r\n[645] In view of the failure of the Trades Union Congress to equip its\r\nParliamentary Committee with any staff that would enable it to deal\r\nwith these problems, the Fabian Society started in 1912 the Fabian\r\nResearch Department, to investigate and supply information upon these\r\nand other questions. This organisation has now become the Labour\r\nResearch Department, an independent federal combination of Trade\r\nUnions, Co-operative and Socialist societies, and other Labour bodies\r\n(including the Labour Party, the English, Scottish, and Irish Trades\r\nUnion Congresses, the Co-operative Union, the _Daily Herald_, most of\r\nthe big Trade Unions, and some hundreds of Trade Councils, Local Labour\r\nParties, etc.), with individual students and investigators. It has its\r\noffices at 34 Eccleston Square, London, S.W.1, next door to those of\r\nthe Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party; issues to its members a\r\nmonthly bulletin of information, and has published many useful books,\r\npamphlets, and monographs. It answers a stream of questions from Trade\r\nUnions all over the country on every conceivable point of theory or\r\npractice; it supplies particulars of rates of pay, hours of labour,\r\nand conditions of employment in other trades; and it is frequently\r\nemployed in helping to prepare cases for submission to Joint Boards or\r\nArbitration Tribunals. Its influential conduct of the “publicity” of\r\nthe National Union of Railwaymen in the 1919 strike has already been\r\ndescribed.\r\n\r\n[646] For instance, Henry Taylor, the coadjutor of Joseph Arch in\r\norganising the agricultural labourers in 1872, was a carpenter;\r\nTom Mann, for two years salaried President of the Dock, Wharf, and\r\nRiverside Labourers, has always been a member, and is now General\r\nSecretary, of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers; whilst Edward\r\nM’Hugh, for some time General Secretary of the National Union of Dock\r\nLabourers, is a compositor; Mr. Charles Duncan, President of the\r\nWorkers’ Union, is an engineer; Mr. R. Walker, General Secretary of\r\nthe Agricultural Labourers’ Union, was successively a shopkeeper and a\r\nrailway clerk, and so on.\r\n\r\n[647] The fervent energy of the typical official of the Labour Union\r\nof that day was well described in 1894 in the following sketch by Mrs.\r\nBruce Glasier (Katherine Conway), a member of the “Independent Labour\r\nParty.” “He has his offices, but is generally conspicuous there from\r\nhis absence. Walter Crane’s ‘Triumph of Labour’ hangs on the wall, and\r\ncopies of _The Fabian Essays_, and the greater proportion of the tracts\r\nissued by the Manchester or Glasgow Labour Presses, lie scattered over\r\nthe room. In England, Byron and Shelley, in Scotland, Byron and Burns,\r\nare the approved poets. Carlyle and a borrowed Ruskin or two are also\r\nin evidence, and a library edition of Thorold Rogers’ _Work and Wages_.\r\nJohn Stuart Mill’s _Political Economy_, side by side with a _Student’s\r\nMarx_, give proof of a laudable determination to go to the roots of the\r\nmatter, and to base all arguments on close and careful study. But the\r\ncall to action is never-ceasing, and train-travelling, if conducive to\r\nthe enormous success of new journalism, affords but little opportunity\r\nfor serious reading. ‘The daily newspapers are continually filled with\r\nlies, which one ought to know how to refute,’ and the situation all\r\nover the globe ‘may develop at any moment.’\r\n\r\n“Yet, unlike the old Unionist leader, he is ever ready for the\r\ninterviewer or the sympathetic inquirer, of whatever class or sex.\r\nRight racily he will describe the rapid growth of the movement since\r\nthe great dock strike of 1889, and show the necessity in dealing with\r\nsuch mixed masses of men as fill the ranks of unskilled labour to-day,\r\nof continually striking while the iron is hot, and of substituting\r\na policy of _coup d’état_ for the deliberate preparation of the\r\nolder Unions. ‘Lose here, win there,’ is our only motto, he says,\r\nresolutely determined to look at defeat from the point of view of a\r\ngeneral-in-chief, and not from the narrower range of an officer in\r\ncharge of a special division. At the moment of surrender he may have\r\nbeen white to the lips, but the next day will find him cheery and\r\nundaunted in another part of the country, carrying on his campaign and\r\nenrolling hundreds of recruits by the sheer energy of his confident\r\neloquence.” (_Weekly Sun_, January 28, 1894.)\r\n\r\n[648] It is, we think, only the Iron and Steel Trades Confederation\r\nthat had laid down and acted on the principle of entrusting the\r\nappointment of salaried officials to the Executive Committee, on the\r\nexpress ground that popular election by ballot is not the right way to\r\nselect administrative officers.\r\n\r\n[649] It would clearly be an advantage if the distinction between those\r\nresponsible for policy (whether designated Executive Councillors,\r\nPresident or otherwise) and those whose function should be executive\r\nonly, were fully borne in mind. Whilst the former should certainly be\r\nelected by, and held responsible to, the membership, it is submitted\r\nthat experience shows the advantage of purely executive officers--which\r\nmay be what the secretaries and district delegates should become--being\r\nappointed by, and held responsible to, those who are elected.\r\n\r\nAt least, a separation should be made between persons elected to be\r\nresponsible for policy, and officers employed for tasks requiring\r\nspecialised training (such as the whole of the insurance work of\r\nthe Union and of its Approved Society; its constantly increasing\r\nstatistical requirements, and its legal business). Such officers should\r\ncertainly be appointed, not elected; and should take no part in the\r\ndecision of issues of policy, even as regards their own department.\r\nSpeaking generally, much more specialisation of functions and officers\r\nshould be aimed at in all Unions of magnitude.\r\n\r\n[650] Such a building was decided on in 1918-19 by joint and separate\r\nconferences of the Trades Union Congress and Labour Party, as a\r\n“Memorial of Freedom and Peace,” in memory of those who lost their\r\nlives in the Great War. It is, however, by no means certain that the\r\nnecessary large cost will be subscribed.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nTHE PLACE OF TRADE UNIONISM IN THE STATE\r\n\r\n[1890-1920]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Trade Union organisation had already become a lawful\r\ninstitution; its leading members had begun to be made members of Royal\r\nCommissions and justices of the peace; they were, now and then, given\r\nsuch Civil Service appointments as Factory Inspectors; and two or three\r\nof them had won their way into the House of Commons. But these advances\r\nwere still exceptional and precarious. The next thirty years were to\r\nsee the legal position of Trade Unionism, actually in consequence of\r\nrenewed assaults, very firmly consolidated by statute, and the Trade\r\nUnion claim to participation in all public enquiries, and to nominate\r\nmembers to all governmental commissions and committees, practically\r\nadmitted. Trade Union representatives have won an equal entrance to\r\nlocal bodies, from Quarter Sessions and all the elected Councils down\r\nto Pension and Food and Profiteering Act Committees; an influential\r\nLabour Party has been established in Parliament; and most remarkable of\r\nall, the Trade Union itself has been tacitly accepted as a part of the\r\nadministrative machinery of the State.\r\n\r\nIt is a characteristic feature of Trade Union history, at the end as\r\nat the beginning of the record of the past hundred years, that we\r\nhave to trace the advance of the Movement through a series of attacks\r\nupon Trade Unionism itself. It is in this light that we regard the\r\nRoyal Commission on Labour set up by the Conservative Government\r\nof 1891. Its professed purpose was to enquire into the relations\r\nbetween Capital and Labour, with a view to their improvement. But its\r\ncomposition was significantly weighted against the wage-earners. It is\r\ntrue that, in the large total membership, seven Trade Union officials\r\nwere included, among them being Mr. Tom Mann; but whilst the great\r\nemployers who sat on the Commission were supported by legislators,\r\nlawyers, and economists of their own class, having substantially\r\ntheir own assumptions and opinions, the Trade Unionist minority was\r\nallowed no expert colleagues. From the start the Commission set\r\nitself--probably quite without any consciousness of bias--to discredit\r\nalike the economic basis of the workmen’s combinations, the methods\r\nand devices of Trade Unionism, and the projects of social and economic\r\nreform that were then making headway in the Trade Union world. In the\r\nend, after two years’ exhaustive enquiry, which cost the nation nearly\r\n£50,000, the majority of the Commissioners either found it impossible,\r\nor deemed it inexpedient, to report anything in the nature of an\r\nindictment against Trade Unionism in theory or practice; and could not\r\nbring themselves to recommend any, even the slightest, reversal of\r\nwhat had, up to the very date of the report, been conceded or enacted,\r\nwhether with regard to the recognition of Trade Unions, the collective\r\nregulation of wages, the legal prescription of minimum conditions of\r\nemployment or the political activities of the workmen’s combinations.\r\nThe majority of the Commissioners--it is significant that they were\r\njoined by three out of the seven Trade Unionists--contented themselves\r\nwith deprecating, and mildly arguing against, every one of the projects\r\nof reform that were then in the air. What is interesting is the fact\r\nthat the most reactionary section of the Commission nearly persuaded\r\ntheir colleagues of the majority to recommend putting Trade Unions\r\ncompulsorily into the strait-jacket of legal incorporation, involving\r\nthem in corporate liability for the acts of their officers or agents,\r\nwith the object of inducing the Unions to enter--not, as is usual\r\nin Collective Bargaining, into treaties defining merely _minimum_\r\nconditions--but into legally binding obligations with the employers, in\r\nwhich the Unions would become liable in damages if any of their members\r\nrefused to work on the collectively prescribed terms. At the last\r\nmoment the majority of the Commissioners recoiled from this proposal,\r\nwhich was left to be put forward as a separate report over the names of\r\nseven Commissioners. The Labour Minority Report, signed by four[651]\r\nout of the seven Trade Unionist Commissioners, whilst protesting\r\nstrongly against any interference with Trade Union freedom, took the\r\nform of a long and detailed plea for a large number of immediately\r\npracticable industrial, economic, and social reforms, envisaged as\r\nstep by step progress towards a complete transformation of the social\r\norder.[652]\r\n\r\nThe Commission had no direct results in legislation or administration;\r\nbut the Board of Trade set up a Labour Department, appointed a number\r\nof Trade Unionists as its officials or correspondents, and started the\r\nadmirably edited monthly _Labour Gazette_. The next move came in the\r\nform of an assault on the legal position of Trade Unionism, which, in\r\none or other manifestation, held the stage for more than a decade.\r\n\r\nFor a quarter of a century the peculiar legal status which had been\r\nconferred upon a Trade Union by the Acts of 1871-76 was not interfered\r\nwith by the lawyers. At the close of the nineteenth century, when\r\nTrade Unionism had by its very success again become unpopular among the\r\npropertied and professional classes, as well as in the business world,\r\na new assault was made upon it.\r\n\r\n\r\nACTIONS FOR DAMAGES\r\n\r\nThe attempt to suppress Trade Unionism by the criminal law was\r\npractically abandoned.[653] But officers of Trade Unions found\r\nthemselves involved in civil actions, in which the employers sued them\r\nfor damages caused by Trade Union activity which the judges held to\r\nbe, although not criminal, nevertheless wrongful. What could no longer\r\nbe punished by imprisonment with hard labour might at any rate be\r\npenalised by heavy damages and costs, for which the Trade Unionist’s\r\nhome could be sold up. The Trade Unions in 1875-80, though, as we have\r\ndescribed, warned by their friendly legal advisers, had not realised\r\nthe importance of insisting that the elastic and indeterminable law\r\nof conspiracy should be put on a reasonable footing; and though they\r\nwere, by 1891, fairly safe from its use to reinforce the criminal\r\nlaw, the lawyers found means, under the figment of “conspiracy to\r\ninjure,” to bring under the head of torts or actionable wrongs the\r\nmost ordinary and non-criminal acts of Trade Union officers which\r\nwould have been, if done by one person only, without conspiracy, no\r\nground for legal proceedings. After-ages will be amazed at the flagrant\r\nunfairness with which the conception of a “conspiracy to injure”\r\nwas applied at the close of the nineteenth century. The greatest\r\npossible injury to other people’s income or business, not involving\r\nthe violation of a recognised legal right, if committed by employers\r\nfor the augmentation of their profits (even in “restraint of trade,”\r\nby means of the deliberate conspiracy of an association), was held\r\nnot to be actionable.[654] But it was held to be an actionable wrong\r\nto the employer for a couple of men to wait in the street, in a town\r\nmany miles distant, for the purpose of quite quietly and peacefully\r\npersuading a workman not to enter into a contract of service. The\r\nmost pacific “picketing” of an employer’s premises, though admittedly\r\nno longer a criminal act, was, if done in concert, held to be an\r\nactionable wrong. If a Trade Union Secretary published a perfectly\r\naccurate list of firms which were “non-Union,” with the intention of\r\nwarning Trade Unionists not to take service with them, this gave each\r\nof the “blacklisted” firms the right to sue him for damages. It was\r\nheld to be ground for damages for a Trade Union official merely to\r\nrequest one firm not to supply goods to another; or to ask an employer\r\nnot to employ any particular person; or even to urge the members of\r\nhis own Union quite lawfully to come out on strike on the termination\r\nof their engagement of service, if the object of the strike was\r\nconsidered by the Court to be to put pressure on the will of some\r\nother employer or some other workman. And whilst any solicitation or\r\npersuasion to break a contract of service by a Trade Union official\r\nwas certainly actionable, it became doubtful whether he would not be\r\nequally liable if he had carefully abstained from, and had really not\r\nintended, any such suggestion, whenever the members of his Society\r\nbecame so influenced by his action, or were thought by the Court to\r\nhave been so influenced, that they, spontaneously and against his\r\ndesires, impetuously came out on strike before their notices had\r\nexpired.[655] It was a further aggravation, of which less advantage\r\nwas actually taken by employers in this country than by those of the\r\nUnited States, that where the Court was convinced that an actionable\r\nwrong was threatened or intended, it was possible very summarily to\r\nobtain an injunction against its commission, any breach of which was\r\npunishable by imprisonment for contempt of Court. It became, therefore,\r\nat least theoretically possible that almost any action by a Trade Union\r\nby which an employer felt himself injured might be summarily prohibited\r\nby peremptory injunction; and some things were thus prohibited, even in\r\nthis country.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TAFF VALE CASE\r\n\r\nAll this development of the Law of Conspiracy and the Law of\r\nTorts, though it went far to render nugatory the intention of the\r\nLegislature in 1871-76 to make lawful a deliberately concerted\r\nstrike, left unchallenged the position of the Trade Union itself\r\nas immune from legal proceedings against its corporate funds, an\r\nanomalous position which everybody understood to have been conceded\r\nby the Acts of 1871-76. In 1901, after thirty years of unquestioned\r\nimmunity, the judges decided, to the almost universal surprise of the\r\nlegal profession as well as of the Trade Union world, that this had\r\nnot been enacted by Parliament. In 1900 a tumultuous and at first\r\nunauthorised strike had broken out among the employees of the Taff\r\nVale Railway Company in South Wales, in the course of which there\r\nhad been a certain amount of tumultuous picketing, and other acts of\r\nan unlawful character. In the teeth of the advice of the Company’s\r\nlawyers, Beasley, the General Manager, insisted on the Company suing\r\nfor damages, not the workmen guilty of the unlawful acts, but the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Railway Servants itself; and on fighting the\r\ncase through to the highest tribunal. After elaborate argument, the Law\r\nLords decided that the Trade Union, though admittedly not a corporate\r\nbody, could be sued in a corporate capacity for damages alleged to\r\nhave been caused by the action of its officers, and that an injunction\r\ncould be issued against it, restraining it and all its officers, not\r\nmerely from criminal acts, but also from unlawfully, though without\r\nthe slightest criminality, causing loss to other persons. Moreover, in\r\ntheir elaborate reasons for their judgement, the Law Lords expressed\r\nthe view that not only an injunction but also a mandamus could be\r\nissued against a Trade Union, requiring it to do anything that any\r\nperson could lawfully call upon it to do; that a registered Trade\r\nUnion could be sued in its registered name, just as if it were a\r\ncorporation; that even an unregistered Trade Union could be made\r\ncollectively liable for damages, and might be sued in the names of\r\nits proper officers, the members of its executive committees and its\r\ntrustees; and that the damages and costs could be recovered from the\r\nproperty of the Trade Union, whether this was in the hands of separate\r\ntrustees or not. The effect of this momentous judgement, in fact,\r\nwas, in flagrant disregard of the intention of the Government and of\r\nParliament in 1871-76, to impose upon a Trade Union, whether registered\r\nor not, although it was still denied the advantages and privileges of\r\nincorporation, complete corporate liability for any injury or damage\r\ncaused by any person who could be deemed to be acting as the agent\r\nof the Union, not merely in respect of any criminal offence which he\r\nmight have committed, but also in respect of any act, not contravening\r\nthe criminal law, which the judges might hold to have been actionable.\r\nThe Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, which had not authorised\r\nthe Taff Vale strike nor any wrongful acts that were committed by the\r\nstrikers, but which, after the strike had occurred, had done its best\r\nto conduct it to a successful issue, and had paid Strike Benefit, was\r\ncompelled to pay £23,000 in damages, and incurred a total expense of\r\n£42,000.[656] It has been estimated that, from first to last, the\r\ndamages and expenses in which the various Trade Unions were cast, owing\r\nto this, and the other judgements against Trade Unions and Trade Union\r\nofficials personally, amounted to not less than £200,000.\r\n\r\nThe little world of Trade Union officials, already alarmed at\r\nthe prospect of being individually sued for damages, was thrown\r\ninto consternation by the Taff Vale judgement, which seemed to\r\ndestroy, at a blow, the status that had been, with so much effort,\r\nacquired in 1871-76. The full extent of the danger was not at first\r\napprehended. Why, it was asked, should not the Trade Union rules,\r\nand the instructions of Trade Union Executive Committees, expressly\r\nforbid the commission by officials of any wrongful acts? It was only\r\ngradually realised that, under the figment of “conspiracy to injure”\r\nthat the lawyers had elaborated, even the most innocent acts, which\r\nan individual could quite lawfully commit, might be held wrongful and\r\nactionable if they were committed by or on behalf of an association\r\nto the pecuniary injury of any other person; and that there was no\r\nassignable limit, as the cases had shown, either to what might be\r\nheld to be wrongful acts, or to the nature or amount of the damage\r\nthat the Courts might hold to have been caused by such acts in the\r\nordinary course of any extensive strike. Moreover, under the ordinary\r\nlaw of agency, the most explicit prohibition of unlawful acts in the\r\nrules of the association, coupled with the most scrupulous care in the\r\nExecutive Committee in framing its instructions to its officials, would\r\nnot prevent the Trade Union from being held liable for any pecuniary\r\ninjury that might be caused, even in defiance of instructions and in\r\ndisobedience to the rules, by any of its officers acting within the\r\nscope of their employment; or, indeed, by any member, paid or unpaid,\r\nwhom the Courts might hold to be acting as the agent of the Union.\r\nAnd as every stoppage of work, however lawful, necessarily involved\r\nfinancial loss to the employers, it could be foreseen that even the\r\nmost carefully conducted strike might be made at least the occasion\r\nfor costly litigation, and probably the opportunity for getting the\r\nTrade Union cast in swingeing damages. The immediate result was very\r\nlargely to paralyse the Executive Committees and responsible officials\r\nof all Trade Unions, and greatly to cripple their action, either in\r\nsecuring improvements in their members’ conditions of employment or\r\nin resisting the employers’ demands for reductions. In particular,\r\nthe general advances for which the railway workers were asking were\r\ndelayed. The capitalists did not fail to use the opportunity to break\r\ndown the workmen’s defences. Trade Unionism had to a great extent lost\r\nits sting.[657]\r\n\r\nThough it took some time for the Trade Union world to realise the\r\nperil, the effect on the Movement was profound. Up and down the country\r\nevery society, great and small, and practically every branch, rallied\r\nin defence of its right to exist. The first result was to make the\r\nnewly-formed Labour Party, which will be hereafter described, and which\r\nhad hitherto hung fire, into an effective political force. The effect\r\nof the Taff Vale judgement was, in 1902-3, to double, and by 1906-7 to\r\ntreble the number of adhering Trade Unions, and to raise the affiliated\r\nmembership of the Party to nearly a million. As the Dissolution of\r\nParliament approached, the Trade Unions organised a systematic canvass\r\nof all prospective candidates, making it plain that none would receive\r\nworking-class support unless they pledged themselves to a Bill to\r\nundo the Taff Vale judgement and put back Trade Unionism into the\r\nlegal position that Parliament had conferred upon it in 1871. When the\r\nGeneral Election at last took place, in January 1906, the Labour Party\r\n(still known as the Labour Representation Committee) put no fewer than\r\nfifty independent candidates in the field, of whom, to the astonishment\r\nof the politicians, twenty-nine were at the head of the poll.[658]\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRADE DISPUTES ACT\r\n\r\nThe first claim of the Labour Party was for the statutory reversal of\r\nthe Taff Vale judgement, which every one now admitted to be necessary.\r\nThe question was what should be done. There were, substantially,\r\nonly two alternatives. One was that, in view of the difficulty of\r\neffectually maintaining it against legal ingenuity, the Trade Unions\r\nshould forgo their position of being outside the law, and should\r\nclaim, instead, full rights, not only of citizenship, but actually\r\nof being duly authorised constituent parts of the social structure,\r\nlawfully fulfilling a recognised function in industrial organisation.\r\nBut for the Trade Union to become, not merely an instrument of defence,\r\nbut actually an organ of government in the industrial world, required\r\na great advance in public opinion. It assumed an explicit recognition\r\nof the legitimate function of the Trade Union, as the basis of a\r\nVocational Democracy, exercising a definite share in the control and\r\nadministration of industry. It involved a complete transformation of\r\nboth the criminal and the civil law, so that workmen’s combinations\r\nand strikes, together with peaceful picketing in its legitimate form,\r\nshould be unreservedly and explicitly legalised; the law of civil\r\nconspiracy practically abrogated, so that nothing should be unlawful\r\nwhen done in concert with others which would not be unlawful if done\r\nby an individual alone; and reasonable limits set to liability for\r\nthe acts of agents and to the scope for injunctions, so that a Trade\r\nUnion Executive would be able both to know the law and to be ensured\r\nagainst its perversion. The alternative was to make no claim for the\r\nprofound advance in Trade Union status that would be involved in such\r\na policy; to forgo any hope of satisfactory or complete amendment of\r\nthe law, and merely to re-enact the exceptional legislation of 1871,\r\nthis time specifically insisting that a Trade Union, whether registered\r\nor not, should be put outside the law, and made expressly immune from\r\nlegal proceedings for anything, whether lawful or unlawful, done by\r\nits officers or by itself. The outgoing Conservative Government had\r\nappointed in 1903 a small Royal Commission to consider the state of the\r\nlaw as to Trade Unionism, before which the Trade Unions had refused\r\nto give evidence, because the Commission, which was made up almost\r\nentirely of lawyers, included no Trade Unionist. This Commission, it\r\nis believed, was told privately not to report until after the General\r\nElection, in order that the Conservative Government might not be\r\nembarrassed by the dilemma. Early in 1906 it reported in favour of the\r\nTrade Union accepting full responsibility for its own actions, subject\r\nto considerable, but far from adequate, amendments of the law.[659]\r\nThis proposal was definitely rejected by the Labour Party, which\r\nintroduced a Bill of its own, merely restoring the position of 1871.\r\nWhen the Liberal Government brought in a Bill very much on the lines\r\nof the Commission’s Report, there was a dramatic exhibition of the\r\nelectoral power that Trade Unionism, once it is roused, can exercise\r\nin its own defence. Member after member rose from different parts of\r\nthe House to explain that they had pledged themselves to vote for the\r\ncomplete immunity which Trade Unions were supposed to have been granted\r\nin 1871. Nothing less than this would suffice; and the most powerful\r\nGovernment hitherto known was constrained, in spite of the protests\r\nof lawyers and employers, to pass into law the Trade Disputes Act of\r\n1906.[660]\r\n\r\nThe Trade Disputes Act, which remains (1920) the main charter of Trade\r\nUnionism, explicitly declares, without any qualification or exception,\r\nthat no civil action shall be entertained against a Trade Union in\r\nrespect of any wrongful act committed by or on behalf of the Union; an\r\nextraordinary and unlimited immunity, however great may be the damage\r\ncaused, and however unwarranted the act, which most lawyers, as well\r\nas all employers, regard as nothing less than monstrous.[661] At the\r\nsame time the Act, whilst not abrogating or even defining the law\r\nas to civil conspiracy, gives three exceptional privileges to Trade\r\nUnion officials by declaring that, _when committed in contemplation\r\nor furtherance of a trade dispute_, (1) an act done in concert shall\r\nnot be actionable if it would not have been actionable if done\r\nwithout concert; (2) attendance solely in order to inform or persuade\r\npeacefully shall be lawful; and (3) an act shall not be actionable\r\nmerely by reason of its inducing another person to break a contract\r\nof employment, or of its being an interference with another person’s\r\nbusiness, or with his right to dispose of his capital or his labour as\r\nhe chooses. These exceptional statutory privileges for the protection\r\nof Trade Union officials in the exercise of their lawful vocation, and\r\nof “pickets” in the performance of their lawful function--in themselves\r\na triumph for Trade Unionism--have ever since excited great resentment\r\nin most of those who are not wage-earners. Some friends of the Trade\r\nUnions expressed at the time the doubt whether the policy thus forced\r\nupon Parliament would prove, in the long run, entirely in the interest\r\nof the Movement; and whether it would not have been better to have\r\nchosen the bolder policy of insisting on a complete reform of the law,\r\nto which, when properly reformed, Trade Unions should be subject in the\r\nsame way as any other associations. The lawyers, as it proved, were not\r\nlong in taking their revenge.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE OSBORNE JUDGEMENT\r\n\r\nThis time the legal assault on Trade Unionism took a new form. The\r\nresult of the dramatic victory of the Trade Disputes Act, and of\r\nthe activity of the Labour members in the House of Commons, was\r\nconsiderably to increase the influence of the Labour Party in the\r\ncountry, where preparations were made for contesting any number of\r\nconstituencies irrespective of the convenience of the Liberal and\r\nConservative parties. The railway companies, in particular, found the\r\npresence in Parliament of the secretary of the railwaymen’s principal\r\nTrade Union very inconvenient. Within a couple of years of the passing\r\nof the Trade Disputes Act, on July 22, 1908, one of the members of\r\nthe Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants took legal proceedings\r\nto restrain it from spending any of its funds on political objects,\r\ncontending that this was beyond the powers of a Trade Union. Such a\r\ncontention found no support among eminent lawyers, several of whom\r\nhad formally advised that Trade Unions were undoubtedly entitled\r\nto undertake political activities if their rules authorised such\r\naction and a majority of their members desired it. W. V. Osborne, the\r\ndissentient member of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, took\r\na different view; and, liberally financed from capitalist sources,\r\ncarried his case right up to the highest tribunal. As a result, in\r\nDecember 1909, as in 1825, 1867-71, and 1901-6, every Trade Union in\r\nthe land found its position and status once more gravely impugned.\r\nIn what became widely known as the Osborne Judgement, the House of\r\nLords, acting in its judicial capacity as the highest Court of Appeal,\r\npractically tore up what had, since 1871, been universally understood\r\nto be the legal constitution of a Trade Union.[662]\r\n\r\nThe decision of the judges in the Osborne case throws so much light,\r\nnot only on the status of Trade Unionism in English law, but also on\r\nthe animus and prejudice which the Trade Disputes Act and the Labour\r\nParty had excited, that we think it worth treating at some length.\r\nFormally this judgement decided only that W. V. Osborne, a member of\r\nthe Walthamstow Branch of the Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants,\r\nwas entitled to restrain that Trade Union from making a levy on its\r\nmembers (and from using any of its funds) for the purpose of supporting\r\nthe Labour Party, or maintaining Members of Parliament. But in the\r\ncourse of that decision a majority of the Law Lords, therein following\r\nall three judges of the Court of Appeal, laid it down as law (and\r\nthereby made it law until Parliament should otherwise determine), (_a_)\r\nthat although Parliament has always avoided any express incorporation\r\nof Trade Unions, these were all now to be deemed to be corporate\r\nbodies, formed under statute, and not unincorporated groups of\r\nindividual persons; (_b_) that it follows, by an undoubted principle\r\nof English law, that a body corporate, created under statute, cannot\r\nlawfully do anything outside the purposes for which the statute has\r\nincorporated it; (_c_) that as the purposes for which Trade Unions are\r\nincorporated have to be found somewhere authoritatively given, the\r\ndefinition which Parliament incidentally enacted in the Trade Union Act\r\nof 1876 must be taken to enumerate, accurately and exhaustively, all\r\nthe purposes which any group of persons falling within that definition\r\ncan, as a corporate body, lawfully pursue; and (_d_) that the payment\r\nof the salaries and election expenses of Members of Parliament, and\r\nindeed, any political action whatsoever, not being mentioned as one of\r\nthese purposes and not being considered by the judges incidental to\r\nthem, could not lawfully be undertaken by any Trade Union, even if it\r\nwas formed, from the outset, with this purpose duly expressed in its\r\noriginal rules, and even if all its members agreed to it, and continued\r\nto desire that their organisation should carry it out.\r\n\r\nThis momentous judgement destroyed, at a blow, the peculiar legal\r\nstatus which Frederic Harrison had devised for Trade Unionism in\r\n1868, and which Parliament thought that it had enacted in 1871-76.\r\nThe statutes of 1871 and 1876, which had always been supposed to\r\nhave enlarged the freedom of Trade Unions, were now held to have\r\ndeprived these bodies of powers that they had formerly enjoyed. It\r\nwas not, as will be seen, a question of protecting a dissentient\r\nminority. Whether the members were unanimous, or whether they were\r\nnearly evenly divided, did not affect the legal position. Trade Unions\r\nfound themselves suddenly forbidden to do anything, even if all their\r\nmembers desired it, which could not be brought within the terms of a\r\nclause in the Act of 1876, which Parliament (as Lord James of Hereford\r\nemphatically declared) never meant to be taken in that sense. “What\r\nis not within the ambit of that statute,” said Lord Halsbury, “is, I\r\nthink, _prohibited_ both to a corporation and a combination.” This was\r\nthe new limitation put on Trade Unions. All their educational work was\r\nprohibited; all their participation in municipal administration was\r\nforbidden; all their association for common purposes in Trades Councils\r\nand the Trades Union Congress became illegal. The judges stopped the\r\nmost characteristic and, as was supposed, the most constitutional of\r\nthe three customary ways that (as we have shown in our _Industrial\r\nDemocracy_) Trade Unions pursued of enforcing their Common Rules,\r\nnamely, the Method of Legal Enactment; grave doubt was thrown on\r\nthe legality of some of the developments of their second way, the\r\nMethod of Mutual Insurance; whilst the way that the House of Lords\r\nexpressly prescribed was exactly that which used to give rise to so\r\nmuch controversy, namely, the Method of Collective Bargaining, with its\r\nconcomitant of the Strike. So topsy-turvy a view of Trade Unionism, a\r\nview which seems to have arisen from the judges’ ignorance of its two\r\ncenturies of history, could not have survived open discussion, and\r\ntherefore could hardly have been taken by even the most prejudiced\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEVELOPMENT OF ENGLISH LAW\r\n\r\nWhat was the explanation of the view of the Trade Union constitution\r\nthat the judges took? The English Courts of Justice, it must be\r\nremembered, have peculiar rules of their own for the construction of\r\nstatutes. When the plain man wants to know what a document means, he\r\nseeks every available explanation of the intention of the author.\r\nWhen the historian inquires the purpose and intention of an Act of\r\nParliament, he considers all the contemporary evidence as to the\r\nminds of those concerned. The Courts of Law, for good and sufficient\r\nreasons, debar themselves from going behind the face of the document,\r\nand are therefore at the mercy of all the unstudied ineptitudes\r\nof House of Commons phraseology. Along with this rigour as to the\r\nintention of a statute, the English and American judges combine a\r\ncapacity for developments of doctrine in the form of legal principles\r\nwhich is, we believe, unequalled in other judicial systems. Now, the\r\nsubject of corporations is one of those in which there had been,\r\namong the past generations of English lawyers, a silent and almost\r\nunselfconscious development of doctrine, of which, in Germany, Gierke\r\nhad been the great inspirer, and Maitland in this country the brilliant\r\nexponent.[663] Our English law long rigidly refused to admit that\r\na corporate entity could arise of itself, without some formal and\r\nlegally authoritative act of outside power. How, it was asked, except\r\nby some definite act of creation by a superior, could the _persona\r\nficta_ come into existence? How, otherwise (as Madox quaintly puts it),\r\ncould this mere “society of mortal men” become something “immortal,\r\ninvisible, and incorporeal”?[664] As a matter of fact, associations or\r\nsocial entities of all sorts always did arise, without the intervention\r\nof the lawyers, and nowadays they arise with amazing ease, without any\r\nact of creation by a superior; and when the English lawyers refused\r\nto recognise them as existing, it was they who were irrational, and\r\nthe common law itself that was at fault. Nowadays we live in a world\r\nof social entities of all sorts, and of every degree of informality,\r\ncorporate entities that to the old-fashioned lawyers are still legally\r\nnon-existent as such--clubs and committees of every possible kind;\r\ngroups and circles, societies and associations for every conceivable\r\npurpose; unions and combinations and trusts in every trade and\r\nprofession; schools and colleges and “University Extension Classes,”\r\noften existing and spending and acting most energetically as entities,\r\nhaving a common purse and a single will, in practice even perpetual\r\nsuccession, and (if they desire such a futile luxury) a common seal,\r\nwithout any sort of formal incorporation. Gradually English lawyers\r\n(whom we need not suspect of reading Gierke, or even, for that matter,\r\nMaitland) were unconsciously imbibing the legally heterodox view that\r\na corporate entity is anything which acts as such; and so far from\r\nmaking it impossible for the _persona ficta_ to come into existence\r\nwithout a formal act of creation, they had been, by little alterations\r\nof procedure and imperceptible changes in legal principles, sometimes\r\nby harmless little dodges and fictions of the Courts themselves,\r\ncoming near to the practical result of putting every association which\r\nis, in fact, a social entity, however informal in its constitution,\r\nand however “spontaneous” in its origin, in the same position of a\r\n_persona ficta_, for the purpose of suing and of being sued, as if it\r\nhad been created by a formal instrument of incorporation, decorated\r\nby many seals, and procured at vast expense from the post-Reformation\r\nPope himself; or as if it had been expressly incorporated by the Royal\r\nCharter of a Protestant King or the private statute of a Victorian\r\nParliament.\r\n\r\nNow this development of legal doctrine to fit the circumstances of\r\nmodern social life is, when one comes to think of it, only common\r\nsense. If twenty old ladies in the workhouse club together to provide\r\nthemselves with a special pot of tea, and agree that one among them\r\nshall be the treasurer of their painfully-hoarded pennies as a common\r\nfund, they do, in fact, create a social entity just as real in its way\r\nas the Governor and Company of the Bank of England. Why should not the\r\nlaw, if it ever comes to hear of the action of the twenty old ladies\r\nin the workhouse, deal with the situation as it really is, according\r\nto their wishes and intentions, without inquiring by what formal act\r\nof external power a _persona ficta_ has been created; and therefore\r\nwithout demanding that the old ladies shall first procure a charter of\r\nincorporation from the Pope, from the King, or from Parliament? And\r\nconsidering that Trade Unions were now in fact social entities, often\r\nhaving behind them more than a hundred years of “perpetual succession”;\r\ncounting sometimes over a hundred thousand members moving by a single\r\nwill; and occasionally accumulating in a common purse as much as half\r\na million of money, the Law Lords might well think it absurd and\r\nirrational of Parliament to have decided in 1871-76, and again in\r\n1906, to regard them as unincorporated groups of persons, having, in a\r\ncorporate capacity, no legally enforceable obligations and hardly any\r\nlegally enforceable rights. It may have been absurd and irrational, but\r\nwhat right--so the Trade Unionists asked--had the judges to change the\r\nlaw?\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the justification for the momentous change in the\r\nlaw which the Six Judges (namely, the three members of the Court\r\nof Appeal, and three out of the five Law Lords, all of whom agreed\r\nin the series of propositions that we have cited) suddenly, without\r\nParliamentary authority, of their own motion effected, it created an\r\nintolerable situation. There was, in the first place, the application\r\nof the doctrine of _ultra vires_ to corporate entities quite unaware\r\nof its existence. It was all very well, in order to fit the law to the\r\nfacts, to throw over the old legal doctrine that the _persona ficta_\r\nof a corporation could only come into existence by some formal act\r\nof incorporation by an external authority. But then it plainly would\r\nnot do to retain, as the Six Judges quite calmly retained, the severe\r\nlimitations on the action of statutory corporate entities which is\r\ninvolved in the doctrine of _ultra vires_, and which, as Lord Halsbury\r\nput it, was to _prohibit_ them from doing what they liked. The argument\r\nfor that principle is that such a corporate entity owes its existence\r\nentirely to the statutory authority by which it is created; that the\r\nlegislature has brought it into being for certain definite purposes;\r\nthat for those purposes and no others the exceptional powers of a\r\ncorporation have been conferred upon it; that as such it is, in a\r\nsense, the agent whom the community has entrusted with the execution of\r\nthese functions, and who cannot therefore (even if all the constituent\r\nmembers of its body so agree and desire) assume any other purposes or\r\nfunctions. But any such doctrine of _ultra vires_ can have no rational\r\napplication to the corporate entity formed by the twenty old ladies in\r\nthe workhouse for their private pot of tea. If we are going, in effect,\r\nto treat as corporate entities all sorts of spontaneously arising\r\nassociations, such as an unregistered Trade Union (and some of the\r\nwealthiest and most powerful Trade Unions were still unregistered), or\r\nsuch as an Employers’ Association (which was hardly ever a registered\r\nbody)--corporate entities which were, in fact, lawfully in existence\r\nlong before the Act of 1876--we must give up the fiction that the\r\npurposes of these associations have been authoritatively fixed and\r\ndefined in advance by Parliament in such a way that the members\r\nthemselves, even when they are unanimous and when they are acting\r\nin strict accord with their constitution and rules, cannot add to\r\nor alter the objects or methods of their organisation. What was\r\nlogically required, in fact, was not the arbitrary identification\r\nof spontaneously arising associative entities with legally created\r\ncorporations, but the formulation of a new conception as to the\r\nfunctions and legal rights that such spontaneously arising associative\r\nentities--to which the limitations of legally created corporations\r\ncould not be simply assumed to apply--should, as a class, be permitted\r\nto exercise.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MISCARRIAGE OF JUSTICE\r\n\r\nWe come now to the second cardinal feature of the decision of the Six\r\nJudges in 1909, in which they showed both prejudice and ignorance.\r\nHaving found that the Trade Unions were, in fact, corporate entities,\r\nand that they had been, in various clumsy ways, dealt with by\r\nParliament very much as if they were legally corporate entities--though\r\nParliament had advisedly abstained from incorporating them, and had,\r\nindeed, always referred to them as being what in fact they were, namely\r\nalready existing and spontaneously arising associations, not created\r\nby its will--the Six Judges took the view that some authoritative\r\nspecification of the objects and purposes of a Trade Union had to\r\nbe discovered by hook or by crook. It seems to have been by them\r\ninconceivable (though Lord James of Hereford, one of their own number,\r\nwho had personally taken part in all the legislation, expressly told\r\nthem it was in fact so) that no such specification should exist. They\r\naccordingly found it in an enumeration which Parliament had given in\r\nthe Act of 1876 of all the various bodies which were to be entitled\r\nto the privileges conferred by the Act--a definition introduced, so\r\na well-informed writer mentioned in 1878, for the special advantage\r\nof Trade Unions[665]--principally to enable them to be registered by\r\nthe Chief Registrar of Friendly Societies. The Law Lords now held that\r\nthis definition must be deemed to be an exhaustive enumeration, not\r\nmerely of the kinds of societies to be eligible for registration, but\r\nalso of all the objects and purposes that Parliament intended any of\r\nthose bodies, whether registered or unregistered, to be free at any\r\ntime to pursue. The result was that all Trade Unions and Employers’\r\nAssociations, and, indeed, all informal groups of workmen or employers\r\nfalling within this definition, suddenly found themselves (to the\r\ncomplete amazement of every one concerned, including the lawyers)\r\nrigidly confined in their action, even if all their members otherwise\r\nwished and agreed, to matters which were specified in an enumerating\r\nclause of an Act of Parliament of a generation before, which had never\r\nbefore been supposed to have that meaning, or to have any restrictive\r\neffect at all. We ought to speak with proper respect of the judges,\r\nthough sometimes, by their curious ignorance of life outside the Law\r\nCourts, and especially of “what everybody knows,” they try us hard.\r\nBut it is necessary to state plainly, with regard to this part of\r\nthe Osborne Judgement, that to the present writers, as to the whole\r\nBritish working class and many other people, including lawyers, it\r\nseemed an astounding aberration, amounting to a grave miscarriage of\r\njustice. Again, let it be noted that Lord James of Hereford, who knew\r\nwhat Parliament had intended, and what Trade Unions actually were,\r\nexpressly dissented from his colleagues on this point, saying that\r\nthe enumeration clause in the Act of 1876 was never intended to be “a\r\nclause of limitation or exhaustive definition” of objects and purposes;\r\nand arguing that it did not prevent a Trade Union from having other\r\npurposes, or pursuing other methods, not in themselves unlawful, even\r\nthough these were not enumerated in the definition clause and were not\r\neven incidental to the purposes therein enumerated. But what is the\r\nhistory of this definition clause? As it stands in the Act of 1876 it\r\nruns as follows:\r\n\r\n The term “Trade Union” means any combination, whether\r\n temporary or permanent, for regulating the relations between\r\n workmen and masters, or between workmen and workmen, or\r\n between masters and masters, or for imposing restrictive\r\n conditions on the conduct of any trade or business, whether\r\n such combination would or would not, if the principal Act\r\n had not been passed, have been deemed to have been an\r\n unlawful combination by reason of some one or more of its\r\n purposes being in restraint of trade.\r\n\r\nNow, to the lay mind, this extremely loose enumeration[666] of kinds\r\nof societies seems plainly intended to bring within its net, and\r\ntherefore to admit to the advantages of the Act, a wide range of\r\nexisting or possible associations of different kinds. It was to include\r\nall sorts of Employers’ Associations as well as Trade Unions. It was\r\nto include bodies already in existence as well as those to be formed\r\nin the future. It was to include bodies seeking to impose restrictive\r\nconditions “in restraint of trade,” as well as those having no such\r\nunlawful objects. It was to include, therefore, bodies already enjoying\r\na full measure of lawful existence and legal recognition, as well\r\nas those for the first time fully legalised by the legislation of\r\n1871-76. To the logician it will be clear that we have here a case\r\nof classification by type, not by delimitation. “It is determined,”\r\nsays Whewell and J. S. Mill, “not by a boundary line without, but by a\r\ncentral point within; not by what it strictly excludes, but by what it\r\neminently includes; by an example, not by a precept.”[667] Accordingly\r\nthe clause names specifically one by one the various attributes, any\r\none of which is to be typical of the class. It sufficed for the purpose\r\nto name only one attribute belonging to each body which it was desired\r\nto include. What its other attributes might be was irrelevant. It\r\ndoes not occur to the ordinary reader, any more than to the logician,\r\nthat the effect of the clause is, not merely to include associations\r\nof different kinds, but also to limit the legal freedom of all those\r\nassociations, with all their varied functions, exclusively to the\r\npurposes specified in the definition, which were merely recited in\r\norder to bring a number of heterogeneous bodies into one class. On the\r\nconstruction put upon this clause by the Six Judges, the Act of 1876\r\nwas a measure which deprived Trade Unions and Employers’ Associations,\r\nmany of which had been for years lawfully in existence, without any\r\nunlawful objects or methods, of a freedom that they had up to then\r\nenjoyed; it was an Act rigidly confining their operations to a limited\r\nfield, and for ever prohibiting them (as Lord Halsbury expressly\r\ndeclared) from doing anything not included in the list of functions\r\nincidentally then and there given. It is safe to say that, to any\r\nhistorical student who knows anything of the circumstances of the case,\r\nsuch a supposition is preposterous. No Trade Union and no Employers’\r\nAssociation was aware in 1876 that its freedom was being thus\r\nrestricted. Thomas Burt, M.P., and Lord James of Hereford (then Sir\r\nHenry James, M.P.), who took part in passing the Act, certainly never\r\ndreamed that they were doing anything of the sort. The Home Office\r\nofficials who prepared it, and Lord Cross (then Home Secretary) who\r\nintroduced it, quite plainly had not the remotest notion that they were\r\ntaking away from Trade Unions (which they were anxious to legalise)\r\nany of the functions which these Unions were in fact exercising, and\r\nwhich such Trade Unions as were lawful associations were already\r\n_lawfully_ exercising; or that they were prohibiting these Trade Unions\r\nfrom doing anything not specified in the incidental enumeration of\r\nattributes that was then, merely for the purpose of including various\r\nkinds of associations, statutorily enacted. As a matter of fact, the\r\ndefinition clause in the Act of 1876 was enacted merely to correct in\r\none small particular the definition clause in the Act of 1871. That\r\nclause had defined a Trade Union as meaning “such combination ... as\r\nwould, if this Act had not passed, been deemed to have been an unlawful\r\ncombination by reason of some one or more of the purposes being in\r\nrestraint of trade.” This was found in practice inconvenient, because\r\nit had inadvertently excluded from registration and all the benefits\r\nof the Act those Trade Unions and Employers’ Associations which were\r\nalready lawful associations, free from any unlawful purpose. A Trade\r\nUnion had to prove that it was (but for the Act) an unlawful body\r\nbefore it could be admitted to the advantages of the Act. It was\r\nalso inexpedient, because it actually offered an inducement to Trade\r\nUnions to have purposes or methods “in restraint of trade,” in order\r\nto obtain these advantages. Now, supposing that the Act of 1876 had\r\nnot been passed, and that the definition clause had remained in the\r\nterms of that of the Act of 1871, would the Six Judges have equally\r\nconstrued it as offering a complete and exhaustive enumeration of the\r\npermissible activities of a Trade Union, making it actually illegal\r\nfor the future for any association of workmen or employers to deal\r\nwith the conditions of employment, _except in ways that would (but for\r\nthe 1871 Act) have been unlawful_? And if the definition clause in\r\nthe 1871 Act cannot be construed as (to use Lord James of Hereford’s\r\nwords) “a clause of limitation or exhaustive definition” of Trade\r\nUnion activities, with what consistency can the definition clause of\r\nthe 1876 Act (which follows the same wording, and merely extends the\r\ndefinition so as to take in lawful as well as unlawful societies) be\r\nso construed? Successive Chief Registrars of Friendly Societies, like\r\nevery one else, had always understood the definition clause to be an\r\nenabling clause, not a restricting one; and they had accordingly for\r\na whole generation willingly registered rules presented to them by\r\nTrade Unions, including in their objects and purposes all sorts of\r\nthings not enumerated in the definition, and not even incidental to\r\nany of the purposes therein enumerated. It was, in 1909, not at first\r\nrealised--certainly the Six Judges did not realise--how extensive and\r\nhow varied were the actually existing operations of Trade Unions that\r\nthey were rendering illegal. Not political action alone, not municipal\r\naction alone, but any work of general education of their members or\r\nothers; the formation of a library; the establishment or management of\r\n“University Extension” or “Workers’ Educational Association” classes;\r\nthe subscription to circulating book-boxes; the provision of public\r\nlectures; the establishment of scholarships at Ruskin College, Oxford,\r\nor any other College--all of which things were at the time actually\r\nbeing done by Trade Unions--were all henceforth to be _ultra vires_\r\nand illegal. The two hundred Trades Councils, local federations of\r\ndifferent Trade Unions for the purpose of dealing with matters of\r\ngeneral interest to workmen, which took no part in the collective\r\nbargaining of any particular Trade Union, were probably thereby\r\nequally made illegal; though they were in 1876 already a quarter of a\r\ncentury old, and in 1909 numbered nearly a million members. The annual\r\nTrade Union Congress itself, then in its fortieth year, and dealing\r\nalmost exclusively with Parliamentary projects, came under the same\r\nban. The active participation which Trade Unions had here and there\r\ntaken in technical education, and their co-operation with the Local\r\nEducation Authorities, which had sometimes been found so useful, were\r\ncertainly _ultra vires_. One would suppose, strictly speaking, that a\r\nsimilar illegality was to attach to all the vast “friendly society”\r\nside of Trade Unionism, with its sick and accident and out-of-work\r\nbenefits--not one of them being referred to in the definition which\r\nthe Six Judges declared to contain an exhaustive enumeration of the\r\npurposes and objects that Parliament intended to permit Trade Unions\r\nto pursue. But here the Six Judges saved themselves--though in a\r\nway logically destructive of their claim that the definition clause\r\nitself was one of “exhaustive” enumeration of permissible Trade Union\r\npurposes--by holding that these friendly benefits, though not mentioned\r\nin the definition clause, were referred to elsewhere in the Act, and\r\nmight be regarded as incidental to the purpose of regulating the\r\nconditions of employment. This, indeed, so far as benefits paid to the\r\nworkman himself are concerned, was a plausible view. Strike Benefit, in\r\nparticular, is plainly incidental to striking, and sick benefit might\r\nconceivably be held to protect the worker from industrial oppression\r\nwhilst sick. But the same cannot be said of the most widely spread of\r\nall Trade Union benefits, the provision of funeral money on a member’s\r\ndeath. In some cases the Trade Unions were actually paying for the\r\nfunerals of their deceased members’ widows and orphan children. This\r\nwas a mere act of humanity to the deceased member’s widow and orphans;\r\nand it could not, by any stretch of imagination, be supposed to improve\r\nthe workers’ bargaining power, or to be in any way incidental to the\r\nregulation or restriction of the conditions of employment. Yet Funeral\r\nBenefit was in 1909 (as it was in 1876) the one among the so-called\r\n“friendly” benefits most universally adopted by Trade Unions. More than\r\na million Trade Unionists were thus effecting through their societies a\r\nhumble life insurance. This extensive life insurance business of Trade\r\nUnions could not be said to be in any way included in the definition\r\nclause of the 1876 Act, even if the sick and unemployment benefits\r\nwere. If the judgements in the Osborne Case were correct, the whole of\r\nthis life insurance business of Trade Unions (as distinguished from\r\nthe sick and unemployment benefits), or at least the whole of that\r\nrelating to widows and orphans, must be held to have been inadvertently\r\nprohibited by Parliament in 1871 and 1876, and to have been ever\r\nsince _ultra vires_ and illegal. It is impossible for the plain man\r\nto avoid the conclusion, even though the six other authorities take\r\na contrary view, that Lord James of Hereford was right in declaring\r\nthat the definition in the Act of 1876 was not meant by Parliament\r\nto be “a clause of limitation or exhaustive definition” of the\r\npermissible purposes of a Trade Union; and, accordingly, that the Six\r\nJudges had--presumably following quite accurately the narrow technical\r\nrules of their profession--put upon the statute a construction which\r\nParliament had in no way intended.\r\n\r\nWhat then did Parliament intend to fix and define as the permissible\r\nobjects and functions of a Trade Union? The answer of the historical\r\nstudent is clear and unhesitating. Parliament quite certainly intended,\r\nin 1871 and 1876, to fix and define nothing of the sort; but meant,\r\nwhether wisely or not, to leave Trade Unions as they then were--as\r\nsuch of them, indeed, as had no unlawful purpose or method had long\r\n_legally_ been--namely, as free as any other unincorporated groups of\r\npersons to take whatever action they might choose, subject only to\r\ntheir own contractual agreements, and to the general law of the land.\r\nFrom this position we venture, as historians, to say that Parliament\r\ndid not, in 1871 or 1876, intentionally depart.\r\n\r\nFinally, we have the argument of the Six Judges that, seeing that the\r\nsole lawful purposes of a Trade Union are “regulating the relations\r\nbetween workmen and masters, or between workmen and workmen, or\r\nbetween masters and masters,” and “imposing restrictive conditions on\r\nthe conduct of any trade or business,” no action of a Parliamentary\r\nor political kind is within the definition, or even incidental to\r\nanything therein. This view, to put it bluntly, showed an ignorance\r\nof Trade Unionism, British industrial history, and the circumstances\r\nnot only of 1871-76, but also of 1908-9, which was as remarkable as\r\nit was deplorable. On the face of it, to take first the words of the\r\nstatute, the most usual and the most natural way of “regulating” the\r\nrelations between people, and the most obvious expedient for “imposing”\r\nrestrictive conditions on industry, is an Act of Parliament. It was\r\nto Acts of Parliament, as we have abundantly shown in _Industrial\r\nDemocracy_, that the Trade Unions had for a century been looking,\r\nand were in 1871-76, many of them, looking, for a very large part of\r\nthe “regulating” of industrial conditions, and of the “restrictive\r\nconditions” that they existed to promote. What the judges apparently\r\nforgot is that conditions of employment include not merely wages,\r\nbut also hours of labour, sanitary conditions, precautions against\r\naccident, compensation for injuries, and what not. If the Six Judges\r\nhad remembered how, in fact, in Great Britain the great majority\r\nof industrial relations were regulated, and how the great mass of\r\nrestrictive conditions were, in fact, imposed on industry; or if they\r\nhad had recalled to them the long and persistent struggle of the Trade\r\nUnions to get adopted the Factory Acts, the Mines Regulation Acts,\r\nthe Truck Acts, the Shop Hours Acts, and so many more, they could\r\nhardly have argued that such actions as engaging in Parliamentary\r\nbusiness, supporting or opposing Parliamentary candidates, and helping\r\nmembers of Parliament favourable to “regulating,” and “imposing\r\nrestrictive conditions”--actions characteristic of Trade Unions\r\nfor generations--were not incidental to these legitimate purposes.\r\nAs a matter of fact, the getting and enforcing of legislation is,\r\nhistorically, as much a part of Trade Union function as maintaining a\r\nstrike.[668] One Trade Union at least, which no one ever dreamt to be\r\nillegal, the United Textile Factory Workers’ Association, has existed\r\nexclusively for political action, and had no other functions.[669] This\r\nkind of Trade Union action is even antecedent in date to any corporate\r\ndealing with employers. During the whole two centuries of Trade Union\r\nhistory, as in _Industrial Democracy_ we have described, the Unions\r\nhave had at their disposal, and have simultaneously adopted, three\r\ndifferent methods of imposing and enforcing the Common Rules which\r\nthey sought to get adopted in the conditions of employment. From 1700\r\ndownwards they have used the Method of Mutual Insurance; from the very\r\nbeginning of the eighteenth century down to the present day the records\r\nshow them to have been continuously employing the Method of Legal\r\nEnactment; whilst only intermittently during the eighteenth century,\r\nand not openly and avowedly until 1824, could they rely on the Method\r\nof Collective Bargaining. The Miners’ Unions, and the Agricultural\r\nLabourers’ Unions, in particular, had been particularly active in\r\nsupport of the extension of the franchise between 1863 and 1884. Even\r\nthe expenditure of Trade Union funds on Parliamentary candidatures\r\nwas practised by Trade Unions at any rate as early as 1868, as soon,\r\nin fact, as the town artisans were enfranchised; and the payment of\r\nTrade Union Members of Parliament was begun as early as 1874, and\r\nhad lasted continuously from that date. Yet the Six Judges assumed,\r\napparently without adequate consideration, and certainly on inaccurate\r\ninformation, that Parliament in 1876 intended to authorise Trade Unions\r\nto pursue their first and third methods, but intended to prohibit them,\r\nfrom that time forth, from using the Method of Legal Enactment, just\r\nat the moment when this latter was being most effectively employed. It\r\nis, indeed, almost comic to remember that the Bill which is supposed to\r\nhave effected this revolution in the Trade Union position was brought\r\nin by Lord Cross, then Sir R. A. Cross, M.P., fresh from his election\r\nby a constituency in which the Trade Unionists had been, politically,\r\nthe dominant factor; that it was debated in a House of Commons in which\r\nthe direct influence of the Trade Unions was at the highest point\r\nthat it had hitherto reached; that at the General Election of 1874,\r\nfrom which the members had lately come, the Trade Unions, as we have\r\ndescribed in the present volume, had worked with might and main for\r\nthe rejection of candidates opposed to their political claims, and had\r\nhad a much larger share than political historians usually recognise\r\nin the Gladstonian defeat; that two Trade Union members were actually\r\nthen sitting in the House, one, at least (Thomas Burt), being openly\r\nmaintained as a salaried representative of his Union, by a salary\r\navowedly fixed on a scale to enable him to sit in Parliament;[670] that\r\nthe Conservative Government promptly introduced the particular legal\r\nenactments to obtain which the Trade Unions had spent their money,\r\nnamely, the Nine Hours Bill, the Employer and Workman Bill, and the\r\nTrade Union Bill; and that the Six Judges ask us to believe that the\r\nlatter Bill, which the Trade Union members themselves helped to pass,\r\nwas designed and intended to prevent Thomas Burt from drawing a salary\r\nfrom the Northumberland Miners’ Mutual Confident Society whilst sitting\r\nin the House of Commons; to prohibit the Northumberland Miners’ Mutual\r\nConfident Society, just because it was a Trade Union, from taking any\r\npart in future elections in the Morpeth Division, and to make the\r\naction of this and all other Trade Unions in paying for political work\r\nand Parliamentary candidatures, even with the unanimous consent of\r\ntheir members, from that time forth illegal.\r\n\r\nWe have thought it worth while to place on record this analysis of the\r\nlegally authoritative part of the Osborne Judgement, which, though\r\npartly modified by a subsequent statute, has not been overruled, and is\r\nstill legally authoritative, because it is of historical importance. It\r\nis significant as showing how far the Courts of Justice were, as lately\r\nas 1909, still out of touch, so far as Trade Unionism is concerned,\r\neither with Parliament or with the political economists. The case was,\r\nhowever, of even greater import. The bias and prejudice, the animus and\r\npartiality--doubtless unconscious to the judges themselves--which were\r\ndisplayed by those who ought to have been free from such intellectual\r\ninfluences; the undisguised glee with which this grave miscarriage of\r\njustice was received by the governing class, and the prolonged delay of\r\na professedly Liberal and Radical Cabinet, and a professedly Liberal\r\nand Radical House of Commons in remedying it, had a great effect on the\r\nminds of the wage-earners, and contributed notably to the increasing\r\nbitterness of feeling against the “governing class,” and against a\r\nState organisation in which such a miscarriage of justice could take\r\nplace. We must, indeed, look behind the legal technicalities of the Six\r\nJudges, and consider what was the animus behind their extraordinary\r\njudgement. The “subservience” of Parliament to the Trade Unions\r\nin passing the Trade Disputes Act of 1906 had excited the deepest\r\nresentment of the lawyers. The progress of the Labour Party was causing\r\na quite exaggerated alarm among members of the governing class. What\r\nlay behind the Osborne Judgement was a determination to exclude the\r\ninfluence of the workmen’s combinations from the political field. This\r\nis really what the Osborne Judgement prohibited. One irreverent legal\r\ncritic, indeed, went so far as to remark that the Law Lords were so\r\nanxious to make it clear that Trade Unions were not to be entitled\r\nto pay for Members of Parliament, that they failed to heed how much\r\nlaw they were severally demolishing in the process! It is instructive\r\nto examine the arguments adduced by the Law Lords and the judges on\r\nthis point, apart from their decision as to Trade Union status. These\r\nopinions could hardly be deemed to be law, as they all differed one\r\nfrom another, and none of them obtained the support of a majority\r\nof the Law Lords. Such as they are, however, they seem not to have\r\nbeen connected with Trade Unionism at all, but with the nature of the\r\nHouse of Commons. One of the Law Lords (Lord James of Hereford) merely\r\nobjected to Trade Unions paying a Member of Parliament who was (as was\r\nquite incorrectly assumed) bound by a rule of the paying body requiring\r\nhim to vote in a particular way, not on labour questions only, but on\r\nall issues that might come before Parliament. Another Law Lord (Lord\r\nShaw), with whom Lord Justice Fletcher Moulton seemed to agree, held\r\nthat what was illegal was not the payment of Members of Parliament,\r\nbut their subjection, by whomsoever paid, to a “pledge-bound” party\r\norganisation (as the Labour Party was alleged to be). Another judge\r\n(Farwell, L.J.) took a different line, and held that it was illegal for\r\na corporate body to require its own members to subscribe collectively\r\ntowards the support of a Member of Parliament with whose views they\r\nmight individually not agree. What the historian and the student of\r\npolitical science will say is that these were matters for legislation,\r\nnot for the sudden intervention of the judiciary. The House of Commons\r\nis prompt enough to defend its own honour and its own “privilege”; and\r\nthe function of the judges will begin when any of the acts referred\r\nto has been made an illegal practice. In 1909, as now, the practices\r\ncomplained of, whether or not they were correctly described, and\r\nhowever objectionable to these particular gentlemen they might be, were\r\nall lawful; and the judges and Law Lords were abusing the privileges of\r\ntheir office by importing them to prejudice the legal issue.\r\n\r\nThe Osborne Judgement received the support, not only of the great mass\r\nof property owners and professional men, but also, though tacitly, of\r\nthe Liberal and Conservative Parties. A distinct challenge was thereby\r\nthrown down to the Trade Union world. Not only were the activities of\r\ntheir Unions to be crippled, not only was their freedom to combine for\r\nwhatever purposes they chose to be abrogated, they were to be expressly\r\nforbidden to aspire to protect their interests or promote their objects\r\nby Parliamentary representation, or in any way to engage in politics.\r\nIt was this challenge to Organised Labour that absorbed the whole\r\ninterest of the Trade Union world for the next three or four years.\r\n\r\nThe experienced Trade Union leaders did not forget that it might\r\nwell be a matter for Trade Union consideration how far it is wise\r\nand prudent for a Trade Union to engage in general politics. We have\r\nelsewhere pointed out[671] with some elaboration how dangerous it may\r\nbecome to the strength and authority of a Trade Union if any large\r\nsection of the persons in the trade are driven out of its ranks, or\r\ndeterred from joining, because they find their convictions outraged\r\nby part of its action. Nothing could be more unwise for a Trade Union\r\nthan to offend its Roman Catholic members by espousing the cause of\r\nsecular education.[672] But this is a point which each Trade Union must\r\ndecide for itself. It is not a matter in which outsiders can offer\r\nmore than counsel. It is clearly not a matter in which the discretion\r\nof the Trade Union, any more than that of an individual employer, can\r\nproperly be limited by law. For no Trade Union can nowadays abstain\r\naltogether from political action. Without co-operating with other\r\nTrade Unions in taking Parliamentary action of a very energetic and\r\nvery watchful kind, it cannot (as long experience has demonstrated\r\nto practically all Trade Unionists) protect the interests of its\r\nmembers. Without taking a vigorous part in promoting, enforcing, and\r\nresisting all sorts of legislation affecting education, sanitation,\r\nthe Poor Law, the whole range of the Factories, Mines, Railways, and\r\nMerchant Shipping Acts, the Shop Hours, Truck, Industrial Arbitration\r\nand Conciliation, and now even the Trade Boards’ Act, the Trade Union\r\ncannot properly fulfil its function of looking after the regulation of\r\nthe conditions of employment. But this is not all. The interests of\r\nits members require the most watchful scrutiny of the administration\r\nof every public department. There is not a day passes but something in\r\nParliament demands its attention. On this point Trade Union opinion is\r\nunanimous. We have never met any member of a Trade Union--and Osborne\r\nhimself is no exception--who has any contrary view. To suggest that\r\nthere is anything improper, or against public policy, for a Trade\r\nUnion to give an annual retaining fee to a Member of Parliament whom\r\nits members trust, or to take the necessary steps to get that member\r\nelected, in order to ensure that what the Trade Union conceives to\r\nbe its own interests shall be protected, was to take up a position\r\nof extraordinary unfairness. When more than a quarter of the whole\r\nHouse of Commons habitually consists, not merely of individual\r\nemployers, but actually of persons drawing salaries or stipends from\r\ncapitalist corporations of one kind or another--when, in fact, the\r\nnumber of companies of shareholders in railways, banks, insurance\r\ncompanies, breweries, ocean telegraphs, shipbuilding yards, shipping\r\ncompanies, steamship lines, iron and steel works, coal mines, and\r\njoint stock enterprises of all sorts actually represented in the\r\nHouse of Commons by their own salaried chairmen, directors, trustees,\r\nmanagers, secretaries, or solicitors is beyond all computation--the\r\nclaim that there is something improper, something inconsistent with\r\nour electoral system, something at variance with the honourable nature\r\nof the House of Commons, for the workmen’s organisations to retain\r\na few dozen of the Members whom the constituencies (knowing of this\r\npayment) deliberately elect, or to help such Members to provide their\r\nelection expenses, is an argument so extraordinary in its unfairness\r\nthat it drives the active-minded workman frantic with rage. It is no\r\nanswer to say that these representatives of capitalist corporations\r\nare not expressly paid to sit in Parliament. They are at any rate\r\ndesired by their employers to sit, and permitted by the law to receive\r\ntheir salaries notwithstanding that they do sit. This was forbidden\r\nto representatives of Trade Unions. That it should be illegal for the\r\nsalaried President or Secretary of the Amalgamated Society of Railway\r\nServants to sit in Parliament, when it is perfectly legal for the much\r\nmore generously salaried Chairman or Director of a Railway Company to\r\nsit there, is an anomaly hard for any candid man to defend; and the\r\nanomaly is all the greater in that the interests of the railway company\r\ncome, almost every year, into conflict with those of the community at\r\nlarge, and the railway chairman is, on these occasions, quite frankly\r\nthere to promote his own company’s Bill, and to defend the interests\r\nof the shareholders by whom he is paid. To say that the workmen’s\r\norganisations shall not pay their representatives in the way that\r\nsuits working-class conditions, whilst railway shareholders may pay\r\ntheir representatives in the way that suits capitalist conditions--to\r\nassume a great concern for the wounded conscience of a Liberal or\r\nConservative Trade Unionist who finds his Union paying its Secretary or\r\nits President to sit as a Radical or Labour Member of Parliament, and\r\nno concern at all for the Socialist or Radical shareholder in a railway\r\ncompany who finds his company paying its Conservative Chairman M.P.--is\r\nto be guilty of an amazing degree of class bias, if not of hypocrisy.\r\nAfter all, it is not the Trade Union but the constituency that elects\r\nthe Member of Parliament. The Trade Union payment only enables him to\r\nstand. Whatever may be thought of the policy of the Labour Party, or\r\nthe particular form of its organisation, if we regard the Trade Union\r\npayment as a retaining fee for looking after what the Trade Union\r\nmembers as a whole conceive to be their own interest; if the Trade\r\nUnion members have the opportunity of choosing, by a majority, which\r\namong competing persons (or, for that matter, which among competing\r\ngroups of persons) they will entrust with this Trade Union task; if the\r\nTrade Union assumes no responsibility for and exercises no coercion\r\nupon its Parliamentary representative with regard to issues on which\r\nit has not voted, no Trade Unionist’s political conscience need be\r\nwounded by the fact that, outside the range of the task that the\r\nTrade Union has confided to him, the Union’s Parliamentary agent (who\r\nmust have views of one sort or another) expresses opinions in accord\r\nwith those of the constituency that elected him, or joins together\r\nwith other members of like opinions to form a political party. When,\r\nthree-quarters of a century ago, J. A. Roebuck was the salaried agent\r\nin the House of Commons for the Legislative Assembly of Lower Canada,\r\nno one complained that it was against the dignity of Parliament for him\r\nto be thus retained and paid; and so long as he attended faithfully to\r\nCanadian business it was never contended that the tender conscience of\r\nany Canadian Conservative was offended by the ultra-Radical utterances\r\nor extremely independent political alliances of the Member for Bath.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE TRADE UNION ACT OF 1913\r\n\r\nIt is an instance of the failure of both the governing class and\r\nthe party politicians to appreciate the workman’s standpoint, or to\r\nunderstand the temper of the Trade Union world, that this crippling\r\njudgement remained for nearly four years unreversed. The Liberal and\r\nConservative Parties were, during 1910 and 1911, quarrelling about the\r\nBudget and the exact powers to be exercised by the House of Lords;\r\nand two successive General Elections were fought without bringing\r\nthe Trade Unions any redress. Meanwhile, up and down the country\r\ndiscontented or venal Trade Unionists were sought out by solicitors and\r\nothers acting for the employers; and were induced to lend their names\r\nto proceedings for injunctions against their own Unions, prohibiting\r\nthem from subscribing to the Labour Party, from contributing towards\r\nthe election expenses of candidates, from taking action in municipal\r\nelections, from subscribing to educational classes, and from taking\r\nshares in a “Labour” newspaper. It may have seemed a skilful political\r\ndodge, during the elections of 1910, to hamstring in this way the\r\ngrowing Labour Party; but the resentment caused by such behaviour\r\nmakes it doubtful whether action of this kind is, in the long run,\r\npolitically advantageous. In the first place, the House of Commons,\r\nin 1911, felt itself compelled, as an alternative to restoring Trade\r\nUnion liberties, to concede the payment of £400 a year to all Members\r\nof Parliament. Finally, in 1913, the Cabinet, after a severe internal\r\nstruggle, brought itself to introduce a Bill giving power generally\r\nto any Trade Union to include in its constitution any lawful purpose\r\nwhatever, so long as its principal objects were those of a Trade\r\nUnion as defined in the 1876 Act; and to spend money on any purpose\r\nthus authorised. It was, indeed, provided that before the financing of\r\ncertain specified political objects could be undertaken, including the\r\nsupport of Parliamentary or Municipal candidates or members, or the\r\npublication or distribution of political documents,[673] a ballot of\r\nthe members was to be held in a prescribed form, and a simple majority\r\nof those voting secured; the payments were to be made out of a special\r\npolitical fund, and any member was to be entitled to claim to be exempt\r\nfrom the special subscription to that political fund. These restrictive\r\nprovisions were opposed by the Labour Members in the House of Commons;\r\nbut with slight amendment the measure was passed into law as the Trade\r\nUnion Act of 1913.[674]\r\n\r\nIt is not easy to sum up the whole effect of the legal assaults upon\r\nTrade Unionism between 1901 and 1913. Politically, the result was to\r\nexasperate the active-minded workmen, and greatly to promote, though\r\nwith some delay, the growth of an independent Labour Party in the\r\nHouse of Commons. On the other hand, it must not be overlooked that\r\nthe temporary crippling of Trade Unionism seemed to be of financial\r\nadvantage to that generation of employers. It was, perhaps, not\r\naltogether an accident that the brunt of the attack had to be borne by\r\nthe Amalgamated Society of Railway Servants, a Union then struggling\r\nfor “recognition” in such a position as to make effective its claims\r\nto better remuneration and shorter hours of labour for the whole body\r\nof railwaymen. It may fairly be reckoned that the railwaymen were, by\r\nmeans of the two great pieces of litigation to which their Union was\r\nsubjected, held at bay for something like a decade, during which the\r\nimprovement in their conditions, in spite of a slowly-increasing cost\r\nof living, was (mainly through the evasions of the railway companies\r\nby their silent “regrading” of their staffs) extremely small.[675] A\r\nrise of wages to the extent of only a penny per hour for the whole body\r\nof railwaymen would have cost the railway companies, in the aggregate,\r\nsomething like five or six million pounds a year. If any such advance\r\nwas, by means of the Taff Vale Case and the Osborne Judgement, staved\r\noff for ten years, the gain to the whole body of railway shareholders\r\nof that generation might be put as high as fifty or sixty millions\r\nsterling--a sum worth taking a little trouble about and spending a\r\nlittle money upon, in items not revealed in the published accounts.\r\nBut the crippling effect of the litigation was not confined to the\r\nAmalgamated Society of Railway Servants, which spent, altogether,\r\nnearly £50,000 in law costs in defending the pass for the whole Trade\r\nUnion Movement. If, in the temporary set-back to trade in 1903-5,\r\nand in the revival that immediately followed it; or in the recurring\r\nset-back of 1908-9, and the great improvement of the ensuing years, the\r\nwhole body of wage-earners in the kingdom lost only a penny per hour\r\nfrom their wages, or gained less than they might otherwise have done to\r\nthe extent of no more than a penny per hour, their financial loss, in\r\none year alone, would have amounted to something like a hundred million\r\npounds. And whatever they forwent in this way, they lost not during\r\none year only, but during at least several years, and many of them\r\nfor a whole decade. There is no doubt that the capitalist employers,\r\nthinking only of their profits for the time being, regarded even a\r\ntemporary crippling of the Trade Union Movement as well worth all that\r\nit might cost them. The historian, thinking more of the secular effort\r\nupon social institutions, will not find the balance-sheet so easy to\r\nconstruct. The final result of the successive attempts between 1901 and\r\n1913 to cripple Trade Unionism by legal proceedings was to give it the\r\nfirmest possible basis in statute law. The right of workmen to combine\r\nfor any purpose not in itself unlawful was definitely established.\r\nThe strike, with its “restraint of trade,” and its interference with\r\nprofits and business; peaceful picketing even on an extensive scale;\r\nthe persuasion of workmen to withdraw from employment even in breach\r\nof contract, and the other frequent incidents of an industrial dispute\r\nwere specifically declared to be, not only not criminal, but actually\r\nlawful. The right of Trade Unions to undertake whatever political and\r\nother activities their members might desire was expressly conceded.\r\nFinally, a complete immunity of Trade Unions in their corporate\r\ncapacity from being sued or made answerable in damages, for any act\r\nwhatsoever, however great might be the damage thereby caused to other\r\nparties, was established by statute in the most absolute form.[676]\r\nThe Trade Unions, it must be remembered, had not asked for these\r\nsweeping changes in their position. They had been, in 1900, content\r\nwith the legislation of 1871-76. It was the successive assaults made\r\nupon them by the legal proceedings of 1901-13 that eventually drove\r\nthe Government and Parliament, rather than formally concede to Trade\r\nUnionism its proper position in the government of industry, and effect\r\nthe necessary fundamental amendment of the law, once more to create for\r\nthe workmen’s organisations an anomalous status.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE RISE IN STATUS OF TRADE UNIONISM\r\n\r\nSo far we have described only the changes in the legal status of the\r\nTrade Unions and the consequent increase in their freedom of action\r\nand in their influence, alike in the industrial and political sphere.\r\nThis advance in legal status has been accompanied by a still more\r\nrevolutionary transformation of the social and political standing of\r\nthe official representatives of the Trade Union world--a transformation\r\nwhich has been immensely accelerated by the Great War. We may, in fact,\r\nnot unfairly say that Trade Unionism has, in 1920, won its recognition\r\nby Parliament and the Government, by law and by custom, as a separate\r\nelement in the community, entitled to distinct recognition as part of\r\nthe social machinery of the State, its members being thus allowed to\r\ngive--like the clergy in Convocation--not only their votes as citizens,\r\nbut also their concurrence as an order or estate.\r\n\r\nLike all revolutionary changes in the British constitution, the\r\nrecognition of the Trade Union Movement as part of the governmental\r\nstructure of the nation began in an almost imperceptible way. Though\r\nTrade Union leaders had been, since 1869, appointed occasionally and\r\nsparsely on Royal Commissions and Departmental Committees, it was\r\npossible, as recently as 1903, for a Government to set up a Royal\r\nCommission on Trade Disputes and Trade Combinations without a single\r\nTrade Unionist member. Such a thing has not been repeated. It is\r\nnow taken for granted that Trade Unionism must be distinctively and\r\neffectually represented, usually by men or women of its own informal\r\nnomination, on all Royal Commissions and Departmental Committees,\r\nwhether or not these inquiries are concerned specifically with “Labour\r\nQuestions”--excepting only such as are so exclusively financial or\r\nprofessional that the representatives of Labour do not seek or desire\r\nrepresentation upon them.\r\n\r\nIn 1885-86, and again in 1892-95, Liberal Prime Ministers had appointed\r\nleading Trade Unionists (who were, it must be noted, also Liberal\r\nM.P.’s) to subordinate Ministerial positions, where they were permitted\r\npractically no influence.[677] In 1905 Sir Henry Campbell-Bannerman\r\nstartled some of his Whig associates by asking Mr. John Burns--who\r\nhad presided over the Trades Union Congress as a representative of\r\nthe Amalgamated Society of Engineers, but who had sat in Parliament\r\nsince 1892 as a Liberal supporter--to join his Cabinet as President\r\nof the Local Government Board. This recognition of Labour in the\r\ninner councils of the Government was quickly followed by an explicit\r\nrecognition of the Trade Unions as part of the machinery of State\r\nadministration. In 1911, when the vast scheme of National Insurance\r\nwas brought forward by Mr. Asquith’s Government, and Parliament\r\nsanctioned the raising and expenditure of more than twenty million\r\npounds a year for the relief of sickness and unemployment, the Trade\r\nUnions, equally with the universally praised Friendly Societies, were\r\nmade the agents for the administration of the sickness, invalidity,\r\nand maternity benefits, and, parallel with the Government’s own local\r\norganisation, and to the exclusion of the Friendly Societies, also\r\nfor the administration of the State Unemployment Benefit to their\r\nown members. But it was during the Great War that we watch the most\r\nextensive advance in the status, alike of the official representatives\r\nof the Trade Unions and of the Trade Unions themselves, as organs\r\nof representation and government. It is needless to say that this\r\nrecognition was not accorded to the Trade Union world without a _quid\r\npro quo_ from the Trade Union Movement to the Government. Hence the\r\npart played by the Trade Unions in the national effort, and its effect\r\non their influence and status, demands explicit notice.\r\n\r\n\r\nBRITISH TRADE UNIONISM AND THE WAR\r\n\r\nThough theoretically internationalist in sympathy, and predominantly\r\nopposed to “militarism” at home as well as abroad, British Trade\r\nUnionism, when war was declared, took a decided line.[678] From\r\nfirst to last the whole strength of the Movement--in spite of the\r\npacifist faith of a relatively small minority, which included the\r\nmost fervent and eloquent of the Labour members and was supported by\r\nthe energetic propaganda of the fraction of the Trade Unionists who\r\nwere also members of the Socialist Society known as the I.L.P.--was\r\nthrown on the side of the nation’s effort. From every industry workmen\r\nflocked to the colours, with the utmost encouragement and assistance\r\nfrom their Trade Unions; until the miners, the railwaymen, and the\r\nengineers, in particular, had to be refused as recruits, exempted\r\nfrom conscription, and even returned from the army, in order that the\r\nindispensable industrial services might be maintained. The number of\r\nworkers in engineering and the manufacture of munitions of war had,\r\nindeed, to be largely increased; and the Government found itself,\r\nwithin a year, under the necessity of asking the Trade Unions for the\r\nunprecedented sacrifice of the relinquishment, for the duration of the\r\nwar, of the entire network of “Trade Union Conditions” which had been\r\nslowly built up by generations of effort for the protection of the\r\nworkmen’s Standard of Life. This enormous draft on the patriotism of\r\nthe rank and file could only be secured by enlisting the support of\r\nthe official representatives of the Trade Union world--by according to\r\nthem a unique and unprecedented place as the diplomatic representatives\r\nof the wage-earning class. In the famous Treasury Conference of\r\nFebruary 1915 the capitalist employers were ignored, and the principal\r\nMinisters of the Crown negotiated directly with the authorised\r\nrepresentatives of the whole Trade Union world, not only in respect of\r\nthe terms of service of Government employees, but also with regard to\r\nthe conditions of employment of all persons, men and women, skilled\r\nand unskilled, unionists and non-unionists, engaged on any work needed\r\nfor the conduct of the war--a phrase which was afterwards stretched to\r\ninclude four-fifths of the entire manual-working class. The Trade Union\r\nExecutives agreed, at this Conference or subsequently, to suspend,\r\nfor the duration of the war, all their rules and customary practices\r\nrestrictive of the output of anything required by the Government for\r\nthe conduct of the war; all limitation of employment to apprenticed\r\nmen, to Trade Unionists, to men of proved technical skill, to adults\r\nand even to the male sex; all reservation of particular jobs or\r\nparticular machines to workers of particular trades; all definition\r\nof a Normal Day, and all objection to overtime, night-work, or Sunday\r\nduty; and even many of the Factory Act prohibitions by which the health\r\nand even the safety of the operatives had been protected. In order that\r\nthe utmost possible output of munitions of every kind might be secured,\r\nelaborate schemes of “dilution” were assented to, under which the\r\nvarious tasks were subdivided and rearranged, a very large amount of\r\nautomatic machinery was introduced, and successive drafts of “dilutees”\r\nwere brought into the factories and workshops--men and boys from other\r\noccupations, sometimes even non-manual workers, as well as women and\r\ngirls--and put to work under the tuition and direction of the minority\r\nof skilled craftsmen at top speed, at time wages differing entirely\r\nfrom the Trade Union rates, or at piecework prices unsafeguarded by\r\nCollective Bargaining, for hours of labour indefinitely lengthened,\r\nsometimes under conditions such as no Trade Union would have permitted.\r\nIt must be recorded to the credit of the Trade Unions that not one\r\nof the societies refused this sacrifice, which was made without any\r\ndemand for compensatory increase of pay, merely upon the condition--to\r\nwhich not only the Ministry, but also the Opposition Leaders and\r\nthe House of Commons as a whole, elaborately and repeatedly pledged\r\nthemselves--that the abandonment of the “Trade Union Conditions” was\r\nonly to be for the duration of the war, and exclusively for the service\r\nof the Government, not to the profit of any private employer; and that\r\neverything that was abrogated was to be reinstated when peace came.\r\n\r\nUnder stress of the national emergency, the Government made ever\r\ngreater demands on the patriotism of the Trade Unions, which accepted\r\nsuccessively, so far as war-work was concerned, a legal abrogation\r\nof the employers’ competition for their members’ services by the\r\nprohibition of advertisement for employees, and of the engagement\r\nof men from other districts--an unprecedented interference with the\r\n“Law of Supply and Demand”--the suspension of the right to strike\r\nfor better terms; the submission of all disputes to the decision of\r\na Government Department of arbitration, the awards of which, with\r\nthe abrogation of the right to strike, or even freely to relinquish\r\nemployment, became virtually compulsory; the legal enforcement\r\nunder penalties of the employer’s workshop rules; and even legally\r\nenforced continuance, not only in munition work, but actually in the\r\nservice of a particular employer, under the penal jurisdiction of\r\nthe ubiquitous Munitions Tribunals. The Munitions of War Acts, 1915,\r\n1916 and 1917, by which all this industrial coercion was statutorily\r\nimposed, were accepted by overwhelming majorities at successive Trade\r\nUnion and Labour Party Conferences. It was a serious aggravation of\r\nthis “involuntary servitude” that the rigid enforcement of compulsory\r\nmilitary service--extended successively from single men to fathers of\r\nfamilies, from 18 years of age to 51--had the incidental effect of\r\nenforcing what was virtually “industrial conscription” on those who\r\nwere left for the indispensable civilian employment; and the individual\r\nworkman realised that the penalty for any failure of implicit obedience\r\nto the foreman might be instant relegation to the trenches. Although\r\nthis inevitable result of Compulsory Military Service was foreseen\r\nand deplored,[679] the successive Military Service Acts were--in view\r\nof the nation’s needs--ratified, in effect, by great majorities at\r\nthe workmen’s National Congresses. The strongest protests were made,\r\nbut as each measure was passed it was accepted without resistance,\r\nand proposals to resist were always rejected by large majorities. It\r\nspeaks volumes, both for the patriotism of the Trade Unionists and for\r\nthe strength of Trade Union loyalty and Trade Union organisation, that\r\nunder such repressive circumstances the Trade Union leaders were able,\r\non the whole, to prevent their members from hindering production by\r\nindustrial revolts. A certain amount of friction was, of course, not to\r\nbe avoided. Strikes, though greatly reduced in number, were not wholly\r\nprevented; and the South Wales coal-miners and the engineering workmen\r\non the Clyde--largely through arbitrary and repressive action by their\r\nrespective employers--broke into open rebellion; which led, in the one\r\nindustry, to the Government overriding the recalcitrant South Wales\r\nemployers and assuming the direction and the financial responsibility\r\nof all the coal mines throughout the kingdom; and, in the other, to\r\nthe arbitrary arrest and deportation of the leaders of the unofficial\r\norganisation of revolt styled the “Clyde Workers’ Committee.” The Trade\r\nUnion Executives and officials, whilst restraining their members and\r\ndeprecating all stoppages of production, were able to put up a good\r\nfight against the unnecessary and unreasonable demands which, with a\r\nview to “after the war” conditions, employers were not unwilling to\r\nuse the national emergency to put forward. These Trade Union spokesmen\r\nhad to obtain for their members the successive rises in money wages\r\nwhich the steadily rising cost of living made necessary, and they had\r\nconstantly to stand their ground in the innumerable mixed committees\r\nand arbitration proceedings into which the Government was always\r\ninveigling them. On the whole, whilst co-operating in every way in\r\nmeeting the national emergency, the Trade Union organisation during\r\nthe four and a-quarter years of war remained intact; and Trade Union\r\nmembership--allowing for the millions absent with the colours--steadily\r\nincreased. Nor did the Trade Union Movement make any serious revolt\r\nwhen the Government found itself unable to fulfil, with any literal\r\nexactness, the specific pledges which it had given to Organised Labour.\r\nThe complications and difficulties of the Government were, in fact, so\r\ngreat that the pledges were not kept. The first promise to be broken\r\nwas that the abrogation of Trade Union Conditions and the removal of\r\neverything restrictive of output should not be allowed to increase the\r\nprofits of the employers. The so-called “Munitions Levy” was imposed\r\nin 1916 on “controlled establishments,” in fulfilment of this pledge,\r\nin order to confiscate for the Exchequer the whole of their excess\r\nprofit, over and above a permitted addition of 20 per cent and very\r\nliberal allowances for increased capital and extra exertion by the\r\nemployers themselves. It will hardly be believed that, in flagrant\r\ndisregard of the specific pledge, within a year this Munitions Levy\r\nwas abolished; and the firms especially benefiting by the workmen’s\r\nsacrifices were made merely subject, in common with all other trades\r\nwhere there had been no such abrogation of Trade Union Conditions, to\r\nthe 80 per cent Excess Profits Duty, with the result of increasing\r\nthe net income left to those employers whose profits had doubled,\r\nand of doing, with regard to all the employers, the very thing that\r\nthe Trade Unions had stipulated should not be done, namely, giving\r\nthe employers themselves a financial interest in “dilution.”[680] As\r\nthe war dragged on, and prices rose, the successive war-bonuses and\r\nadditions to wages--especially those of the miners and the bulk of\r\nthe women workers--in many cases fell steadily behind the rise in the\r\ncost of living; and in 1917 the War Cabinet was actually guilty of a\r\nformal instruction to the presumedly impartial central arbitration\r\ntribunal that no further increase of wages was to be awarded--an\r\ninstruction which, on its public disclosure, had to be apologised for\r\nand virtually withdrawn. Even the pledge as to wages in the solemn\r\n“Treasury Agreement” of 1915, at which the “Trade Union Conditions”\r\nwere surrendered, was not fulfilled, at any rate as regards the women\r\nworkers; and had to be made the subject of a subsequent serious\r\ninvestigation by the War Cabinet Committee on Women in Industry, in\r\nwhich all the “white-washing” of a Government majority failed to\r\nconvince the Trade Unionists, any more than it did the only unpaid\r\nmember of the Committee, that the Government officials had not\r\nbetrayed them.[681] The solemnly promised “Restoration of Trade Union\r\nConditions” was only imperfectly carried out. What the Government did,\r\nand that only after long delay, was not what it had promised, namely,\r\nactually to see the pre-war conditions and practices reinstated, but\r\nto enact a statute enabling the workmen to proceed in the law courts\r\nagainst employers who failed to restore them; continuance of any such\r\nrestoration to be obligatory only for one year.[682]\r\n\r\nThe Trade Unionists, in fact, who had at the outset of the war\r\npatriotically refrained from bargaining as to the price of their\r\naid, were, on the whole, “done” at its close. Though here and there\r\nparticular sections had received exceptionally high earnings in the\r\ntime of stress, the rates of wages, taking industry as a whole, did\r\nnot, as the Government returns prove, rise either so quickly or so high\r\nas the cost of living; so that, whilst many persons suffered great\r\nhardship, the great majority of wage-earners found the product in\r\ncommodities of their rates of pay in 1919 less rather than more than\r\nit was in 1913. During the war, indeed, many thousands of households\r\ngot in the aggregate more, and both earned and needed more; because\r\nthe young and the aged were at work and costing more than when not\r\nat work, whilst overtime and night-work increased the strain and the\r\nrequirements of all. When peace came, it was found that the Government,\r\nfor all its promises, had made no arrangements whatever to prevent\r\nunemployment; and none to relieve the unemployed beyond an entirely\r\nimprovised and dwindling weekly dole, which (so far as civilians were\r\nconcerned) was suddenly brought to an end on November 20, 1919, without\r\nany alternative provision being immediately made.\r\n\r\nIt would thus be easy to argue that the representatives of the Trade\r\nUnion world made a series of bad bargains with the Government, and\r\nthrough the Government with the capitalist employers, at a time when\r\nthe nation’s needs would have enabled the organised manual workers\r\nalmost to dictate their own terms. But this is to take a short-sighted\r\nview. It is a sufficient answer to say that the great mass of the Trade\r\nUnionists, like the leaders themselves, wanted above all things that\r\nthe nation should win the war; found it repugnant to make stipulations\r\nin the national emergency, and did not realise the extent to which\r\nthey were being tricked and cheated by the officials. But apart from\r\nthis impulsive and unself-regarding patriotism we think that, when\r\nit becomes possible to cast up and balance all the results of the\r\ninnovations of the war period, the Trade Union Movement will be found\r\nto have gained and not lost. We may suggest, perhaps paradoxically,\r\nthat the very ease with which the War Cabinet suppressed the civil\r\nliberties of the manual-working wage-earners during the war, and even\r\ncontinued after the Armistice a machinery of industrial _espionage_,\r\nwith _agents provocateurs_ of workshop “sedition,” enormously increased\r\nthe solidarity of the Trade Union Movement--an effect intensified\r\nduring 1919 by the costly and futile intervention of the British\r\nGovernment in Russia on behalf of military leaders whom the Trade\r\nUnionists, rightly or wrongly, believed to be organising the forces of\r\npolitical and economic reaction. Sober and responsible Trade Unionists,\r\nwho had taken for granted the easy-going freedom and tolerance\r\ncharacteristic of English life in times of peace, suddenly realised\r\nthat these conditions could at any moment be withdrawn from them by\r\nwhat seemed the arbitrary fiat of a Government over which they found\r\nthat they had no control. In this way the abrogation of Trade Union\r\nliberty during the war gave the same sort of intellectual fillip to\r\nTrade Unionism and the Labour Party in 1915-19 that had been given in\r\n1901-13 by the Taff Vale Case and the Osborne Judgement. At the same\r\ntime the Government found itself compelled, in order to secure the\r\nco-operation of the Trade Unions, both during the war and amid the\r\nmenacing economic conditions of the first half of 1919, to accord to\r\nthem, and to their leaders, a _locus standi_ in the determination of\r\nessentially national issues that was undreamt of in previous times.\r\nThe Trade Unions, in fact, through shouldering their responsibility in\r\nthe national cause, gained enormously in social and political status.\r\nIn practically every branch of public administration, from unimportant\r\nlocal committees up to the Cabinet itself, we find the Trade Union\r\nworld now accepted as forming, virtually, a separate constituency,\r\nwhich has to be specially represented. We shall tell the tale in our\r\nnext chapter of the participation of members of the Parliamentary\r\nLabour Party in the Coalition Governments of Mr. Asquith and Mr. Lloyd\r\nGeorge. What is here relevant is that these Trade Union officials\r\nwere selected in the main, not on personal grounds, but because they\r\nrepresented the Trade Union Movement. They accepted ministerial office\r\nwith the approval, and they relinquished ministerial office at the\r\nrequest of the National Conference of the Labour Party, in which the\r\nTrade Unions exercised the predominant influence. A similar recognition\r\nof the Trade Union Movement has marked all the recently constituted\r\nLocal Government structure, from the committees set up in 1914 for\r\nthe relief of distress to those organised in 1917 for the rationing\r\nand control of the food supply, and the tribunals formed in 1919 for\r\nthe suppression of “profiteering.” In all these cases the Government\r\nspecifically required the appointment of representatives of the local\r\nTrade Unions. Trade Unionists have to constitute half the members\r\nappointed to the Advisory Committees attached to the Employment\r\nExchanges; and Trade Unionist workmen sit, not only on the temporary\r\n“Munitions Courts” administering the disciplinary provisions of the\r\nMunitions of War Acts, but also on the local Tribunals of Appeal to\r\ndetermine whether a workman is entitled to the State Unemployment\r\nBenefit. In the administration of the Military and Naval Pensions Act\r\nof 1916 a further step in recognition of Trade Unionism was taken. Not\r\nonly were the nominees of Labour placed upon the Statutory (Central)\r\nPensions Committee, but, in the order constituting the Local Pensions\r\nCommittees, the Trade Union organisations in each locality, which\r\nwere named in the schemes, were expressly and specifically accorded\r\nthe right to elect whom they chose as their representatives on these\r\ncommittees by which the pensions were to be awarded.[683] When,\r\ntowards the close of the war, the Committee presided over by the Rt.\r\nHon. J. H. Whitley, M.P., propounded its scheme of Joint Industrial\r\nCouncils of equal numbers of representative employers and workers\r\nfor the supervision and eventual administration of many matters of\r\ninterest in each industry throughout the kingdom--the “mouse” which\r\nwas practically the whole outcome as regards industrial reorganisation\r\nof the Ministry of Reconstruction--it was specifically to the Trade\r\nUnions in each industry, and to them alone, that the election of the\r\nwage-earners’ representatives was entrusted.[684] When, in 1919, it\r\nseemed desirable to make a series of comprehensive reforms in the terms\r\nof employment, it was not to Parliament that the Prime Minister turned,\r\nbut to a “National Industrial Conference,” to which he summoned some\r\nfive hundred representatives of the Employers’ Associations and Trade\r\nUnions. It was by this body, through its own sub-committee of thirty\r\nemployers’ representatives and thirty Trade Union representatives,\r\nthat were elaborated the measures instituting a Legal Maximum Eight\r\nHours Day and a statutory Minimum Wage Commission that the Ministry\r\nundertook to present to Parliament. In the Royal Commission on\r\nAgriculture of 1919, the several Unions enrolling farm labourers were\r\ninvited to nominate as many members (eight) as were accorded to the\r\nfarmers, whilst of the four remaining members appointed as scientific\r\nor statistical experts--all landlords being excluded--two were chosen\r\namong those known to be sympathetic to Labour. In the statutory Coal\r\nIndustry Commission of the same year, to which reference has already\r\nbeen made, the Miners’ Federation made its participation absolutely\r\nconditional on being allowed to nominate half of the total membership,\r\nunder a presumedly impartial Judge of the High Court, including not\r\nmerely three Trade Union officials to balance the three mine-owners,\r\nbut also three out of the six “disinterested” members by whom--all\r\nroyalty owners being excluded--the Commission was to be completed.\r\nAll this constitutional development is at once the recognition and the\r\nresult of the new position in the State that Trade Unionism has won--a\r\nposition due not merely to the numerical growth that we have described,\r\nbut also to the uprise of new ideas and wider aspirations in the Trade\r\nUnion world itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE REVOLUTION IN THOUGHT\r\n\r\nThe new ideas which are to-day taking root in the Trade Union world\r\ncentre round the aspiration of the organisations of manual workers\r\nto take part--some would urge the predominant part, a few might say\r\nthe sole part--in the control and direction of the industries in\r\nwhich they gain their livelihood. Such a claim was made, as we have\r\ndescribed in the third chapter of this work, in its most extreme form,\r\nby the revolutionary Trade Unionism of 1830-34; and it lingered on\r\nin the minds of the Chartists as long as any of them survived. But\r\nafter the collapse, in 1848, of Chartism as an organised movement\r\nBritish Trade Unionism settled down to the attainment of a strictly\r\nlimited end--the maintenance and progressive improvement, within each\r\nseparate occupation or craft, of the terms of the bargain made by the\r\nwage-earner with the employers, including alike all the conditions of\r\nservice and complete freedom from personal oppression. Hence the Trade\r\nUnionist as such, during the second half of the nineteenth century,\r\ntacitly accepted the existing organisation of industry. He discussed\r\nthe rival advantages of private enterprise carried on in the interests\r\nof the capitalist profit-maker on the one hand, and of the Consumers’\r\nCo-operative Movement or State and Municipal enterprise on the other,\r\nalmost exclusively from the standpoint of whether the profit-making\r\nemployers or the representatives of the consumers or the citizens\r\noffered better conditions of employment to the members of his own\r\norganisation. Right down to the end of the nineteenth century this\r\nremained the dominant working-class view. We find in the proceedings\r\nof the Royal Commission on Labour, 1891-94, a striking demonstration of\r\nthe strictly limited purpose of British Trade Unionism at that date.\r\nWhether we study the elaborate collection of Trade Union rules and\r\nother documents made by the Commission, or the personal evidence given\r\nby the leaders or advocates of Trade Unionism, we find from beginning\r\nto end absolutely no claim, and even no suggestion, that the Trade\r\nUnion should participate in the direction of industry, otherwise than\r\nin arranging with the employers the conditions of the wage-earner’s\r\nworking life.[685] One or two Unions included, among their published\r\n“objects,” vague and pious references to the desirability of\r\nco-operative production; but the assumption was always that any such\r\nco-operative production would be carried out by the members of the\r\nUnion working in and managing a particular establishment, which would\r\ntake its place, like any private establishment, within the framework of\r\nthe capitalist system. When a Trade Union leader was also a Socialist\r\nhe assumed that the “Socialisation” of industry would be carried out\r\nby the Central or Local Government, or by the Consumers’ Co-operative\r\nMovement. Hence, Mr. Tom Mann, himself a Royal Commissioner, who was\r\ncalled as a witness before the Commission, was a powerful advocate of\r\nnationalisation and municipalisation. “I am distinctly favourable,\r\nand am associated with those who are earnestly advocating,” he stated\r\nfrom the witness-chair, “the advisability of encouraging the State to\r\nat once entertain the proposal of the State control of railways. I am\r\nalso identified with those who are favourable to the nationalisation\r\nof the land, which means, of course, a State control of land in the\r\ncommon interest; and I am continually advocating the desirability\r\nfor statesmen and politicians and municipal councillors to try and\r\nunderstand in what particular departments of industry they can get to\r\nwork and exercise their faculties in controlling trade and industry in\r\nthe common interest where that interest would be likely to be secured\r\nbetter than under the present method.” When asked by the Duke of\r\nDevonshire whether his advocacy of the nationalisation of the railways\r\nwas in the interests of the public or mainly in the interests of the\r\nworkmen employed on the railways, he replied: “Not mainly on behalf\r\nof the workers; I would put it equally so. I believe it would serve\r\nthe public interest, the general well-being of the community.... I do\r\nnot believe that a Government Department will ever be healthy until\r\nthe public themselves are healthy in this direction, and are keeping a\r\nwatchful eye upon the whole governmental show and secure the general\r\nwell-being by their watchfulness. I do not think that State control of\r\nindustry will ever be brought about until that development on the part\r\nof the public themselves is brought about, and they desire to see it\r\ncontrolled in the common interest.... When a sufficient number of men\r\nare prepared to take the initiative, and educate public opinion to the\r\ndesirability of a superior method of control in the common interest,\r\nthen I believe it will be done, not all at once, but gradually.”[686]\r\n\r\nBut Mr. Tom Mann did not stand alone. The Independent Labour Party,\r\nthe largest and the most popular of Socialist societies in the United\r\nKingdom, established in 1893, and largely recruited from the ranks of\r\nTrade Unionists, carried on, right down to the outbreak of the Great\r\nWar, a vigorous propaganda in favour of an indefinite extension of\r\nState and Municipal administration of industrial undertakings, whilst\r\nthe more doctrinaire Social Democratic Federation was, in its early\r\ndays, outspokenly contemptuous of the whole Trade Union Movement as a\r\nmere “palliative” of the Capitalist system. This bias in favour of the\r\ncommunal organisation, in favour of the government of the people by and\r\nfor the people organised in geographical areas, was, until the opening\r\nof the twentieth century, equally dominant among the most “advanced”\r\nLabour and Socialist thinkers on the Continent of Europe.[687]\r\n\r\nBut in spite of the assumption that services and industries ought to\r\nbe carried out by democracies of consumers and citizens, organised in\r\ngeographical districts--that is, by the Central and Local Government\r\nof a Political Democracy--there always remained, in the hearts of the\r\nmanual working class in Great Britain, an instinctive faith in the\r\nopposite idea of Associations of Producers owning, as such, both the\r\ninstruments and the product of their labour. Throughout the whole\r\nof the second half of the nineteenth century it was pathetic to see\r\nthis faith struggling on, in spite of the almost constant failure of\r\nthe innumerable little manufacturing establishments carried on by\r\nAssociations of Producers. What finally killed it as an ideal, in\r\nthe eyes of the Trade Unionists of Great Britain, was the fact that\r\nCo-operative Production and its child, Co-partnership, were taken up by\r\nthe most reactionary persons and parties in the State. Great peers and\r\nConservative statesmen were always blessing “Co-operative Production,”\r\nand always trying to stimulate the workers to undertake business on\r\ntheir own account. When the invariable failure of self-governing\r\nworkshops became too obvious, the advocates of Co-operative Production\r\nfell back on “Labour Co-partnership”--partnership in business with the\r\ncapitalist class! This was so obviously, and almost avowedly, an attack\r\non, or at least a proposal for the supersession of Trade Unionism, that\r\nit aroused the fiercest opposition; and the very idea became anathema\r\nin the Trade Union world. In short, there was, from the collapse of\r\nOwenism and Chartism in the eighteen-thirties and -forties, right\r\ndown to 1900, practically no sign that the British Trade Unions ever\r\nthought of themselves otherwise than as organisations to secure an\r\never-improving Standard of Life by means of an ever-increasing control\r\nof the conditions under which they worked. They neither desired nor\r\nsought any participation in the management of the technical processes\r\nof industry (except in so far as these might affect the conditions\r\nof their employment, or the selection of persons to be employed);\r\nwhilst it never occurred to a Trade Union to claim any power over, or\r\nresponsibility for, buying the raw materials or marketing the product.\r\nOn the contrary, the most advanced Trade Union leaders were never tired\r\nof asserting that their members must enjoy the full standard conditions\r\nof employment, whatever arrangements the employers might make with\r\nregard to the other factors of production; or however unskilful\r\nemployers or groups of employers might prove to be in the buying of the\r\nraw material, or in the selling of the commodities in the markets of\r\nthe world.\r\n\r\nWith the opening years of the twentieth century we become aware of a\r\nnew intellectual ferment, not confined to any one country, nor even\r\nto the manual working class. We watch, emerging in various forms, new\r\nvariants of the old idea of the organisation of industries and services\r\nby those who are actually carrying them on. We see it working among\r\nthe brain-working professionals. Alike in England and in France the\r\nteachers in the schools and the professors in the colleges began to\r\nassert both their moral right to manage the institutions as they alone\r\nknow how, and the advantage that this would be to the community. The\r\ndoctors were demanding a similar control over the exercise of their own\r\nfunction. But the most conspicuous, and the most widely influential,\r\nof the forms taken by the idea was the revolutionary movement that\r\nspread among large sections of the wage-earners almost simultaneously\r\nin France, the classic home of associations of producers, and in the\r\nUnited States, with its large population of foreign immigrants. In both\r\nthese countries any widespread Trade Unionism was of much more recent\r\ngrowth than in Great Britain, and was still regarded, alike by the\r\nemployers and by the Government, as an undesirable and revolutionary\r\nforce. The “_syndicats_” of France, and the Labour Unions among the\r\nforeign workers in the United States were, in fact, at the opening\r\nof the twentieth century, in much the same stage of development as\r\nthe British Trade Unions were when they were swept into the vortex of\r\nrevolutionary Owenism in 1834. Alike in their constitutions and in\r\ntheir declared objects, in the first decade of the new century, the\r\nGeneral Confederation of Labour in France and the Industrial Workers of\r\nthe World in the United States bear a striking resemblance to the Grand\r\nNational Consolidated Trades Union that we have described in an earlier\r\nchapter; and, like that organisation, both of them excited a quite\r\nexaggerated terror in the hearts of magistrates and Ministers of State.\r\nIndeed, the doctrines and phraseology of the mass of literature turned\r\nout by French Trade Unionists between 1900 and 1910 are remarkably\r\nlike--allowing for the superior literary power of the French--the\r\npamphlets and leaflets of the Owenite Trade Unionism.[688] There is the\r\nsame conception of a republic of industry, consisting of a federation\r\nof Trade Unions, local and central; the federation of shop clubs,\r\nbranches, or local unions forming the Local Authority for all purposes,\r\nwhilst a standing conference of the national representatives of all the\r\nTrade Unions constitutes a co-ordinating or superintending National\r\nAuthority. There is the same reliance, as a means of achievement, on\r\ncontinuous strikes, culminating in a “general expropriatory strike.”\r\nThere is the same denunciation of the political State as a useless\r\nencumbrance, and the same appeal to the soldiers to join the workers in\r\nupsetting the existing system.\r\n\r\nWe need not stay to inquire how this new ferment crossed the Atlantic\r\nor the Channel. Between 1905 and 1910 we become aware of the birth,\r\nin some of the industrial districts, of a number of new propagandist\r\ngroups--more especially among the miners and engineers--groups of\r\npersons in revolt not only against the Capitalist System but against\r\nthe limited aims of contemporary Trade Unionism and the usual\r\ncategories of contemporary Socialism. The pioneer of the new faith\r\nin the United Kingdom seems to have been James Connolly, afterwards\r\norganiser of the Irish Transport and General Workers Union, to\r\nwhich we have already referred, a man of noble character and fine\r\nintelligence, whose tragic execution in 1916, after the suppression of\r\nthe Dublin rising, made him one of the martyred heroes of the Irish\r\nrace. Connolly, who was a disciple of the founder of the American\r\nSocialist Labour Party, Daniel De Leon, started a similar organisation\r\non the Clyde in 1905. In opposition to the contemporary Socialist\r\npropaganda in favour of the nationalisation and municipalisation of\r\nindustries and services, to be brought about by political action, he\r\nadvocated the direct supersession of the Capitalist System in each\r\nworkshop and in every industry, by the organised workers thereof.\r\n“It is an axiom,” he said, “enforced by all the experience of the\r\nages, that they who rule industrially will rule politically....\r\nThat natural law leads us as individuals to unite in our craft, as\r\ncrafts to unite in our industry, as industries in our class; and the\r\nfinished expression of that evolution is, we believe, the appearance\r\nof our class upon the political battle-ground with all the economic\r\npower behind it to enforce its mandates. Until that day dawns our\r\npolitical parties of the working class are but propagandist agencies,\r\nJohn the Baptists of the New Redemption; but when that day dawns our\r\npolitical party will be armed with all the might of our class; will\r\nbe revolutionary in fact as well as in thought.” “Let us be clear,”\r\nhe adds, “as to the function of Industrial Unionism. That function is\r\nto build up an industrial republic inside the shell of the political\r\nState, in order that when that industrial republic is fully organised\r\nit may crack the shell of the political State and step into its place\r\nin the scheme of the universe.... Under a Socialist form of society\r\nthe administration of affairs wall be in the hands of representatives\r\nof the various industries of the nation; ... the workers in the\r\nshops and factories will organise themselves into unions, each union\r\ncomprising all the workers at a given industry; ... said union will\r\ndemocratically control the workshop life of its own industry, electing\r\nall foremen, etc., and regulating the routine of labour in that\r\nindustry in subordination to the needs of society in general, to the\r\nneeds of its allied trades and to the department of industry to which\r\nit belongs.... Representatives elected from these various departments\r\nof industry will meet and form the industrial administration or\r\nnational government of the country. In short, Social Democracy, as\r\nits name implies, is the application to industry, or to the social\r\nlife of the nation, of the fundamental principles of Democracy. Such\r\napplication will necessarily have to begin in the workshop, and\r\nproceed logically and consecutively upward through all the grades of\r\nindustrial organisation until it reaches the culminating point of\r\nnational executive power and direction. In other words, Socialism must\r\nproceed from the bottom upwards, whereas capitalist political society\r\nis organised from above downward; Socialism will be administered by a\r\ncommittee of experts elected from the industries and professions of\r\nthe land; capitalist society is governed by representatives elected\r\nfrom districts, and is based upon territorial division.”[689] A similar\r\nferment was to be seen at work amongst the South Wales miners, giving\r\nrise to a series of propagandist organisations, preaching the doctrine\r\nof Industrial Unionism as a revolutionary force, and culminating in the\r\nmuch-denounced pamphlet _The Miners’ Next Step_, 1912, which created\r\nsome sensation in the capitalist world.[690]\r\n\r\nIn 1910 we find Mr. Tom Mann, fresh from organising strikes in\r\nAustralia, and inspired by a visit to Paris, preaching the new faith\r\nto large popular audiences in London and the principal provincial\r\ncities with the same sincerity and eloquence with which he had formerly\r\nadvocated State and Municipal Socialism and the statutory regulation\r\nof the conditions of employment. “The Industrial Syndicalist,” he\r\nexplains, holds that “to run industry through Parliament, that is\r\nby State machinery, will be even more mischievous to the working\r\nclass than the existing method, for it will assuredly mean that the\r\ncapitalist class will, through Government Departments, exercise over\r\nthe national forces, and over the workers, a domination that is\r\neven more rigid than is the case to-day. And the Syndicalist also\r\ndeclares that in the near future the industrially organised workers\r\nwill themselves undertake the entire responsibility of running the\r\nindustries in the interest of all who work, and are entitled to enjoy\r\nthe result of labour.”[691] “We therefore most certainly favour\r\nstrikes; we shall always do our best to help strikes to be successful,\r\nand shall prepare the way as rapidly as possible for +The General\r\nStrike+ of national proportions. This will be the actual Social and\r\nIndustrial Revolution. The workers will refuse to any longer manipulate\r\nthe machinery of production in the interest of the capitalist class,\r\nand there will be no power on earth able to compel them to work\r\nwhen they thus refuse.... When the capitalists get tired of running\r\nindustries, the workers will cheerfully invite them to abdicate, and\r\nthrough and by their industrial organisations will run the industries\r\nthemselves in the interests of the whole community.”[692] “Finally, and\r\nvitally essential it is,” sums up Mr. Tom Mann in 1911, “to show that\r\neconomic emancipation to the working class can only be secured by the\r\nworking class asserting its power in workshops, factories, warehouses,\r\nmills and mines, on ships and boats and engines, and wherever work is\r\nperformed, ever extending their control over the tools of production,\r\nuntil, by the power of the internationally organised Proletariat,\r\ncapitalist production shall entirely cease, and the industrial\r\nsocialist republic will be ushered in, and thus the Social Revolution\r\nrealised.”[693]\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary Industrial Unionism and Syndicalism preached by\r\nJames Connolly and Tom Mann and other fervent missionaries between\r\n1905 and 1912 did not commend itself to the officials and leaders of\r\nthe Trade Unions any more than it did to the cautious and essentially\r\nConservative-minded men and women who make up the rank and file of\r\nthe British working class. But, like other revolutionary movements in\r\nEngland, it prepared the way for constitutional proposals. The ideal of\r\ntaking over the instruments of production appealed to all intelligent\r\nworkmen as workmen. To them it seemed merely Co-operative Production\r\nwrit large, the ownership of the instruments and of the product of\r\nlabour by the workers themselves. But the ownership and management was\r\nnow to be carried out, not by small competing establishments doomed\r\nto failure, but in the industry as a whole by a “blackleg-proof”\r\nTrade Union. To the idealistic and active-minded Trade Union official\r\nin particular, weary of the perpetual haggling with employers over\r\nfractional changes in wages and hours, the prospect of becoming the\r\nrepresentative of his fellow-workers in a self-governing industry,\r\nwith all the initiative and responsibility that such a position\r\nwould involve, was decidedly attractive. So long as this ideal was\r\nassociated with violent and revolutionary methods, and left no room\r\nfor the political democracy to which Englishmen are accustomed,\r\nor even for the Consumers’ Co-operative Movement, it failed to get\r\naccepted either by responsible officials or by the mass of sober-minded\r\nmembers. The bridge between the old conception of Trade Unionism and\r\nthe new was built by a fresh group of Socialists, who called themselves\r\nNational Guildsmen. This group of able thinkers, largely drawn\r\nfrom the Universities, accepted from what we may call the Communal\r\nSocialists the idea of the ownership of the instruments of production\r\nby the representatives of the citizen-consumers, but proposed to vest\r\nthe management in national associations of the producers in each\r\nindustry--organisations which they declared ought to include, not\r\nmerely the present wage-earners, but all the workers, by hand or by\r\nbrain.[694] These guilds were to grow out of the existing Trade Unions,\r\ngradually made co-extensive with each industry. We have neither the\r\nspace, nor would it be within the scope of this book, to describe or\r\ncriticise this conception of National Guilds, or the theories and\r\nschemes of the Guild Socialists. These theories and schemes are none\r\nthe worse for being still in the making. What we are concerned with, as\r\nhistorians of the Trade Union Movement, is the rapid adoption between\r\n1913 and 1920 by many of the younger leaders of the Movement, and\r\nsubject to various modifications, also by some of the most powerful of\r\nthe Trade Unions, of this new ideal of the development of the existing\r\nTrade Unions into self-organised, self-contained, self-governing\r\nindustrial democracies, as supplying the future method of conducting\r\nindustries and services. The schemes put forward by the National Union\r\nof Railwaymen, the Miners’ Federation of Great Britain, and the Union\r\nof Postal Workers differ widely from the revolutionary Syndicalism\r\nof Mr. Tom Mann and the large visions of the Industrial Workers of\r\nthe World. They do not even go so far as the projects of the National\r\nGuildsmen. In fact, they limit the claim of the manual workers merely\r\nto participation in the management, fully conceding that the final\r\nauthority must be vested in the representatives of the community\r\nof citizens or consumers. Thus we see the Annual General Meeting\r\nof the National Union of Railwaymen in 1914 resolving unanimously:\r\n“That this Congress, while reaffirming previous decisions in favour\r\nof the nationalisation of railways, and approving the action of the\r\nExecutive Committee in arranging to obtain and give evidence before\r\nthe Royal Commission, declares that no system of State ownership of\r\nthe railways will be acceptable to organised railwaymen which does not\r\nguarantee to them their full political and social rights, _allow them\r\na due measure of control and responsibility in the safe and efficient\r\nworking of the railway system_, and assure to them a fair and equitable\r\nparticipation of the increased benefits likely to accrue from a more\r\neconomical and scientific administration.”[695] In a modified form this\r\nresolution was brought forward by the Railway Clerks’ Association,\r\nsupported by the N.U.R., and passed by the Trades Union Congress of\r\n1917.[696] A similar movement in favour of participation in management\r\nhas taken root among the postal workers of all kinds, in England as\r\nalso in France. At the Annual Conference, in May 1919, of the Postal\r\nand Telegraph Clerks’ Association, which had in previous years been\r\npassing resolutions on the subject, it was emphatically pointed out\r\nthat the control demanded by the postal employees was not restricted\r\nto securing better conditions of employment, but that they desired\r\nto participate in directing the technical improvement of the service\r\nfor the good of the community.[697] The Conference resolved: “That in\r\nview of the obstructive attitude of the Department on the question of\r\nthe development of the Post Office Savings Bank, the modernising of\r\nthe Post Office Insurance System, and the expansion and improvement\r\nof the Post Office Services generally, this Conference directs that\r\nrepresentatives of the Association be appointed to investigate and\r\nreport on the working of the postal cheque and transfer services from\r\nboth the national and international standpoint, and that the report\r\nbe widely circulated, and propaganda work undertaken, so that this\r\ndevelopment of the Post Office Savings Bank--giving a greatly improved\r\ntransmission of moneys system--be introduced throughout.”[698] Finally,\r\nwe may cite the scheme for the Nationalisation of the Coal-mines that\r\nthe Miners’ Federation brought formally before the Coal Industry\r\nCommission in 1919. Six years previously the Miners’ Federation had had\r\na Bill drafted and published, which provided merely for the vesting of\r\nthe collieries in a Ministry of Mines, and for the administration of\r\nthe whole industry by that department.[699] All that the Federation was\r\nthen concerned to secure for the miners themselves was the continuance\r\nof free and lawful Trade Unionism. The Bill of 1919[700] imposed on the\r\nMinister of Mines a whole series of National and District Councils,\r\nand Pit Committees, each of which was to consist, to the extent of one\r\nhalf, of members nominated by the Federation, the other half being\r\nnominated by the Minister; and the expectation was not concealed that\r\nit would be by these bipartite bodies that the administration would be\r\nconducted. We record these schemes, which are by the nature of the case\r\nonly imperfect drafts prepared for propaganda, not so much for their\r\nimportance as precisely defined industrial constitutions, but as being\r\nindicative of the change of spirit that has come over the Trade Union\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INCREASED RELIANCE ON DIRECT ACTION\r\n\r\nThe acceptance, during the last decade, by Parliament, by the Executive\r\nGovernment, and by public opinion, of the Trade Union organisation as\r\npart of the machinery of government in all matters concerning the life\r\nand labour of the manual working class, has been coincident, some would\r\nsay paradoxically coincident, with an increased reliance on the strike,\r\ncommonly known as the method of Direct Action, and with an enlargement\r\nof the purposes for which this method is used by Trade Unionists.\r\nThere is an impression in the public mind, which easily forgets its\r\nprevious impressions of the same kind, that we are to-day (1920) living\r\nin an era of strikes. Although this impression is not justified\r\nby the number of strikes, as compared with those of 1825, 1833-34,\r\n1857-60, 1871-74, and 1885-86, there is some basis for the feeling. The\r\nstrikes and threats of strikes during the past decade (excluding the\r\nfour years of war) have been on a larger scale, and, in a sense, more\r\nmenacing, than those of previous periods. When we published, in 1897,\r\nour detailed analysis of the theory and practice of contemporary Trade\r\nUnionism (_Industrial Democracy_), the very term “direct action” was\r\nunknown in this country. The strike was regarded, not as a distinct\r\nmethod of Trade Union action, but merely as the culminating incident\r\nof a breakdown of the Method of Collective Bargaining.[701] The Trade\r\nUnion plea for the right to strike has always been a simple one. It\r\nis a mere derivative of the right of Freedom of Contract. Whenever an\r\nindividual workman had the right to refuse to enter or continue in a\r\ncontract of service, any group of individuals might, if they chose,\r\nexercise a like freedom. After the collapse of Owenism and Chartism\r\nall thought of using the weapon of the strike, otherwise than as an\r\nincident in Collective Bargaining with the employers, seems to have\r\nleft the Trade Union Movement in Great Britain. Indeed, during the\r\nlast half of the nineteenth century, the use of the weapon of the\r\nstrike was falling into disrepute, even as an incident of Collective\r\nBargaining, not only among the officials of the great trade friendly\r\nsocieties, such as the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and Carpenters,\r\nbut also among the younger and more militant members of the Trade\r\nUnion movement. The “extremists” of the last decade of the nineteenth\r\ncentury, as we have described in a previous chapter, were out for the\r\n“capture” of Parliament and Local Authorities by an “independent” Party\r\nof Labour; and political action was commonly regarded as the shortest\r\nand most convenient way of securing not only Socialist but also the\r\ndistinctively Trade Union objects. It was at that time left to the\r\n“reactionaries” in the Trade Union Movement, who disliked the idea of a\r\npolitical Labour Party, to advocate reliance on “ourselves alone.”[702]\r\n\r\nBut with the revolution of thought that we have described there has\r\narisen, with regard to Direct Action, a change of practice. In 1913-14\r\nthere was an outburst of exasperated strikes designed, we may almost\r\nsay, to supersede Collective Bargaining--to repudiate any making of\r\nlong-term agreements, to spring demand after demand upon employers,\r\nto compel every workman to join the Union, avowedly with the view\r\nof building up the Trade Union as a dominant force. This spasm of\r\nindustrial “insurrectionism” was abruptly stopped by the outbreak of\r\nwar. The “political” element creeps in with the strikes and threats\r\nof strikes of the Miners’ Federation in 1912 and 1919, designed, not\r\nto further Collective Bargaining with the employers, but to cause the\r\nGovernment and Parliament to alter the organisation of the industry,\r\nin the earlier case by the enactment of a Minimum Wage law, and in the\r\nother by the elimination of the capitalist profitmaker in favour of\r\npublic ownership and workers’ control. During the years of war Direct\r\nAction took another form. The weapon of a concerted refusal to work was\r\nused by some Trade Unions, in matters entirely unconnected with their\r\nconditions of employment, in order to prevent particular individuals\r\nfrom doing what they wished to do. The most sensational examples were\r\nafforded by the National Union of Sailors and Firemen in 1917-18,\r\nwhen its members, by refusing to work, at the dictation of Mr. J.\r\nHavelock Wilson, the Secretary of the Union, prevented certain Labour\r\nLeaders[703] from proceeding to Petrograd, actually by direction of\r\nthe Government; and subsequently others[704] from going to Paris with\r\nGovernment passports, on the instructions of the Labour Party, because\r\nthe Union, or at any rate Mr. Havelock Wilson, disapproved of these\r\nvisits, and of their supposed object in arranging for an International\r\nLabour and Socialist Congress. Another case was the withdrawal by the\r\nElectrical Trades Union in 1918 of their members (taking with them\r\nthe indispensable fuses) from the Albert Hall in London, when the\r\ndirectors of the Hall cancelled its letting for a Labour Demonstration,\r\nof the purposes and resolutions of which they disapproved, or thought\r\nthat their patrons would disapprove. What the Electrical Trades Union\r\nintimated was that, unless the Hall was allowed, as heretofore, to\r\nbe used for Labour meetings, it should not be used for a forthcoming\r\ndemonstration of the supporters of the Coalition Government, or for any\r\nother meetings. The result was that (it is said on a hint from Downing\r\nStreet) the directors of the Hall withdrew their objection to the\r\nLabour Demonstration, and have since continued to allow such meetings.\r\nYet another example of Direct Action was given by the printing staffs\r\nof certain newspaper offices in London during the railway strike of\r\n1919, when they threatened instantly to withdraw their labour, and thus\r\nabsolutely to prevent the issue of the newspapers, unless the use of\r\n“lying posters” was given up, and unless the case of the National Union\r\nof Railwaymen was fairly treated in the papers, and accorded reasonable\r\nspace. The gravest case of all was the threat by the Miners’ Federation\r\nin 1919, that all the coal-mines might stop working unless Compulsory\r\nMilitary Service was immediately brought to an end, and unless the\r\npolicy of military intervention in Russia against the Bolshevik\r\nGovernment of Russia was abandoned. By what was perhaps a fortunate\r\ncoincidence the Secretary of State for War was able to declare that all\r\nCompulsory Military Service was to cease at or before the end of the\r\ncurrent financial year; and the Prime Minister to announce that no more\r\ntroops, and, after certain consignments already arranged for, no more\r\nmilitary stores, would be sent in aid of those who were attacking the\r\nBolshevik Government.\r\n\r\nHow far can these instances of Direct Action be deemed to indicate\r\na change of thought in the Trade Union world with regard to the use\r\nof the strike weapon? We must note that, in spite of the temporary\r\nlull in strikes in the latter part of the last century, there has\r\nbeen no change in Trade Union policy with regard to the strike in\r\ndisputes with employers about the conditions of employment. The Trade\r\nUnions have always included in this term the dismissal of men for\r\nreasons other than their inefficiency as workmen, the engagement of\r\nnon-Unionists, the presence of an obnoxious foreman or manager, or any\r\ninterference with the conduct of employees outside the works. Nor has\r\nthere been any development in the original Trade Union position with\r\nregard to sympathetic strikes in aid of other sections of workers in\r\ntheir struggles with their employers. It is possible that some of the\r\ninsurrectionary strikes of 1911-14 were inspired by the new thought\r\nthat we have described--the disillusionment as to the Parliamentary\r\npotency of a Labour Party, and the vision of a Democracy based on\r\nindustrial organisation and secured by industrial action. But, in the\r\nmain, the increased frequency and magnitude of strikes in these years\r\nare sufficiently accounted for by the continued fall in real wages due\r\nto rising prices, combined with the steadily improving organisation\r\nof the workers concerned. There was a new element in the proposal of\r\nthe Miners’ Federation in 1919 to strike if the Government did not\r\nfulfil its pledge to carry into effect the Sankey Report described\r\nin the last chapter. The significant and authoritative declaration\r\nin the first Report of March 20, 1919, that “the present system of\r\nownership and working in the coal industry stands condemned, and some\r\nother system must be substituted for it, either nationalisation or a\r\nmethod of unification by national purchase and/or by joint control,”\r\nand the explicit acceptance of this Report by the Government “in the\r\nspirit and in the letter,” formed an integral part of the bargain\r\nbetween the Miners’ Federation and the Government, on the strength of\r\nwhich they forewent the strike at the end of March 1919 on which they\r\nhad decided. It can hardly be contended that the “present system of\r\nownership and working” is not a necessary part of the conditions of\r\nemployment, or that the Miners are not entitled to refuse to enter into\r\ncontracts of service under a system that Mr. Bonar Law agrees with\r\nMr. Justice Sankey, and nine out of the other twelve members of the\r\nRoyal Commission, in holding to “stand condemned.” On the other hand,\r\nthough the Government controls the industry and dictates the wages, the\r\nalterations in the conditions of employment that the Miners’ Federation\r\nasks for require not only one but probably several Acts of Parliament,\r\nwhich a majority of the members of the present House of Commons,\r\nnotwithstanding the explicit Government pledge, refuses to pass. What\r\nthe Miners’ Federation threatens, by a stoppage of the coal industry,\r\nis to coerce into agreement with them not their employers, the colliery\r\nowners, not even the Ministry with whom they made the bargain, but, in\r\neffect, the recalcitrant capitalist majority of the House of Commons\r\nwhich cannot be displaced without a General Election.\r\n\r\nBut an entirely new development of Direct Action, alike in form and\r\nin substance, is the distinctly political, or, as we should prefer to\r\ncall it, the non-economic strike--that is, the strike, not for any\r\nalteration in the conditions of employment of any section of the Trade\r\nUnion world, but with a view to enforce, either on individuals, on\r\nParliament, or on the Government, some other course of action desired\r\nby the strikers. So far as we know, there is, on this question, no\r\nconsistent body of opinion in the Trade Union world; all that we find\r\nare currents of opinion arising from different assumptions of social\r\nexpediency. There is, first, a small section of Trade Unionists who\r\nare Syndicalists or extreme Industrial Unionists in opinion, and who\r\nlook forward to the supersession of political Democracy, and the\r\nreconstitution of society on the basis of the suffrages of the several\r\ntrades. Like the Sinn Feiners in Ireland, though on different grounds,\r\nthey do not acknowledge the competency of the existing Parliament to\r\nundertake the government of the country, and they advocate Direct\r\nAction as the only weapon of revolt accessible to the workers organised\r\nas workers. But it was no such theory of social revolution that induced\r\nMr. Havelock Wilson to prevent the visit of Mr. G. H. Roberts and\r\nMr. MacDonald to Petrograd, when the Government wished them to go;\r\nor to prevent Mr. Henderson and M. Camille Huysmans from using their\r\npassports to Paris. Nor were the electricians of the Albert Hall\r\ninspired by faith in an immediate revolution of the Russian type. It\r\ncannot even be suggested that the widespread approval by the more\r\nactive spirits of the Trade Union world of the proposed strike to stop\r\nthe intervention of Great Britain in support of the reactionary Russian\r\nleaders was accompanied by any desire to set up in Great Britain the\r\nconstitution which is believed to obtain in Moscow and Petrograd. We\r\nmust look elsewhere for the motive that underlies and is held by many\r\nto justify the non-economic or “political” strike.\r\n\r\nWe suggest that the explanation is a more complex one. We have first\r\nthe impulsive tendency of some men in all classes to use any powers\r\nthat they possess, whether over land, capital, or labour, to dictate to\r\ntheir fellow-men a course of conduct on any question on which they feel\r\nhotly, even if it is wholly unconnected with their several economic\r\nfunctions. This delight in an anarchic use of economic power is, it is\r\nneedless to say, not peculiar to those whose economic power is that of\r\nlabour. There have been innumerable instances, within our own memories,\r\namong landlords and capitalists, of actions no less arbitrary than that\r\nof Mr. Havelock Wilson (who, it must be remembered, had the general\r\napproval of the capitalist press; and, in the case of the attempted\r\ninternment in this country of a distinguished Belgian visitor,\r\nM. Huysmans, the connivance of the naval officers, if not of the\r\nAdmiralty). We find within the last few decades many cases of landlords\r\nwho have ejected persons, not because they were objectionable tenants,\r\nor had failed to pay their rent, but because they had supported a\r\npolitical candidate, or had led to action on the part of the Local\r\nAuthority, to which the landlord objected. We have seen landed\r\nproprietors refusing sites for Nonconformist chapels, not because they\r\nobjected to buildings of that character, or were dissatisfied with the\r\nprice offered, but because they disliked the theology of the promoters.\r\nWe have heard of banks refusing to the Trade Unions who were their\r\ncustomers any accommodation at all on the occasion of a strike, merely\r\nbecause they disliked the strike. We have seen employers dismissing\r\nworkmen, not for their inefficiency, not even for their Trade Union\r\nactivities, which might be held to affect the economic interest of the\r\ncapitalist, but because the workmen held different political opinions\r\nfrom those of the employer. But these cases of the use of economic\r\npower to prevent individuals from pursuing or promoting their own\r\nreligious or political creeds are emphatically condemned by the Trade\r\nUnion Movement. Thus no Trade Union support was overtly given to Mr.\r\nHavelock Wilson, even by those Trade Union leaders who agreed with him\r\nin detesting any meeting between Britons and enemy subjects.\r\n\r\nWe have a quite different class of cases when Direct Action is taken in\r\nreprisal for the Direct Action of other persons or groups of persons.\r\nThis was the case in the strike of the electricians at the Albert\r\nHall. It was a reprisal for the use by the directors of the Albert\r\nHall of their power over lettings to ban opinions that they happened\r\nto dislike, whilst permitting the use of their hall to the other side.\r\nA more difficult case is that of the threatened refusal to work of\r\nthe compositors against the newspapers who denied fair play to the\r\nrailwaymen. Here our judgement may depend on what view is taken of the\r\nfunction of newspapers; how far are newspapers what their name implies,\r\nthe public purveyors of news? Supposing that all the capitalist press\r\nwere deliberately to boycott all Labour news, whilst deliberately\r\ngiving currency to false statements about Labour Leaders and the Labour\r\nMovement, would the compositors, as representing the Trade Union world\r\nin this industry, be justified in a strike? The only conclusion we\r\ncan suggest is that, human nature being instinctively militant, any\r\nanarchic use of the power given by one form of monopoly will lead to a\r\nsimilar anarchic use of the power given by another form of monopoly.\r\n\r\nWe come now to the third class of use of the method of Direct Action,\r\na general strike of the manual workers to compel the Government of the\r\ncountry to abstain from political courses distasteful to those who\r\ncontrol a monopoly of labour power, or to the majority of them. This\r\nform of Direct Action is justified by a minority of Trade Unionists,\r\nwho consider that under the present constitution of Parliament the\r\norganised workmen have practically no chance of getting their fair\r\nshare of representation--an argument strengthened by every election\r\ntrick, and especially by the partisan use of the capitalist press as\r\nan election instrument. The majority of Trade Unionists, however,\r\ndo not, at the present time, seem to support this view. They reply\r\nthat the manual workers and their wives now constitute, in every\r\ndistrict, a majority of the electorate. They can, if they choose,\r\nreturn to Parliament a Labour majority and make a Labour Government.\r\nThis very consideration, indeed, seems to make any such general strike\r\nimpracticable, and, as a matter of fact, no such proposal of a general\r\nstrike has yet been endorsed by the Trades Union Congress. We can\r\nimagine occasions that might, in the eyes of the Trade Union world,\r\nfully justify a general strike of non-economic or political character.\r\nIf, for instance, a reactionary Parliament were to pass a measure\r\ndisfranchising the bulk of the manual workers, or depriving them of\r\npolitical power by such a device as the “Three Class Franchise” of\r\nPrussia and Saxony--if any Act were passed depriving the Trade Unions\r\nof the rights and liberties now conceded to them--if the Executive\r\nor the judges were to use against the Trade Unions, by injunction or\r\notherwise, any weapon that might be fished up from the legal armoury,\r\nconfiscating their funds or prohibiting their action--then, indeed,\r\nwe might see the Trades Union Congress recommending a General Strike;\r\nand it would be supported not only by the wage-earning class as a\r\nwhole, but also by a large section of the middle class, and even by\r\nsome members of the House of Lords. That is one reason why, short\r\nof madness, no such act would be committed by the Government or by\r\nParliament. If any such act were perpetrated, it would probably involve\r\na revolution not in the British but in the continental sense. It must\r\nbe remembered that the “last word” in Direct Action is with the police\r\nand the army, and there not with the officers but with the rank and\r\nfile.\r\n\r\nTo sum up, the vast majority of Trade Unionists object to Direct\r\nAction, whether by landlords or capitalists or by organised workers,\r\nfor objects other than those connected with the economic function\r\nof the Direct Actionists. Trade Unionists, on the whole, are not\r\nprepared to disapprove of Direct Action as a reprisal for Direct Action\r\ntaken by other persons or groups. With regard to a general strike of\r\nnon-economic or political character, in favour of a particular home or\r\nforeign policy, we very much doubt whether the Trade Union Congress\r\ncould be induced to endorse it, or the rank and file to carry it out,\r\nexcept only in case the Government made a direct attack upon the\r\npolitical or industrial liberty of the manual working class, which it\r\nseemed imperative to resist by every possible means, not excluding\r\nforceful revolution itself.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DEMAND FOR THE ELIMINATION OF THE CAPITALIST PROFIT-MAKER\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to note that this widening enlargement of the\r\naspirations and purposes of Trade Unionism has been accompanied, not\r\nby any decline, but by an actual renewal of the faith in Communal\r\nSocialism, towards which we described the Trade Union Movement as\r\ntending in 1889-94. For the Trade Unionist objects, more strongly than\r\never, to any financial partnership with the capitalist employers, or\r\nwith the shareholders, in any industry or service, on the sufficient\r\nground that any such sharing of profits would, whilst leaving intact\r\nthe tribute of rent and interest to proprietors, irretrievably break up\r\nthe solidarity of the manual working class. To the new school of Trade\r\nUnionists the nationalisation or municipalisation of industry, or its\r\nassumption by consumers’ co-operation, is a necessary preliminary to\r\nthe partnership of Labour in its government. What they are after is to\r\nalter, not only the status of the manual worker, but also the status of\r\nthe employer who is the director of industry; they wish them both to\r\nbecome the agents of the community; they desire that manual workers and\r\nbrain workers alike should be inspired, not by the greed of gain made\r\nby profit on price, but by the desire to produce the commodities and\r\nservices needed by the community in return for a sufficient livelihood,\r\nand the personal freedom and personal responsibility which they believe\r\nwould spring from vocational self-government. Thus we find Mr. Hodges,\r\nthe General Secretary of the Miners’ Federation, in one of his numerous\r\nspeeches in favour of the nationalisation of the mines, declaring that\r\nwhat they demanded was “a new status for the worker as a controller of\r\nhis industry. Miners were not anarchists, although they had the power\r\nto be. They realised that their interests were bound up with those\r\nof the community, and therefore they demanded conditions which would\r\ndevelop the corporate sense.... Education was carrying men along social\r\nrather than individualistic lines, and right throughout the mining\r\nindustry there was the desire to be something different from what they\r\nwere. This desire to be master of the work in which the man was engaged\r\nwas the great thing that was vital in working-class life.... There\r\nhad never been a movement born of greater moral aspiration than this\r\nmovement for the nationalisation of the mines. The miner wanted to be\r\nin a position where it would be to him a point of honour not to allow\r\neven a piece of timber to be wasted, where he would want to do his work\r\nwell. He wanted a Social Contract.”[705]\r\n\r\nThe demand for the nationalisation or municipalisation of industries\r\nand services, or their absorption by the Consumers’ Co-operative\r\nMovement, was greatly strengthened by the experience, during the war\r\nand after the Armistice, of the failure of every alternative method\r\nof preventing “profiteering.” The rapid development of capitalist\r\ncombinations and price-agreements[706]; the ill-success of the most\r\nstringent Government control in preventing alarming increases of price;\r\nthe inability of even legally fixed maximum prices to do anything more,\r\nunder private ownership, than authorise the charge required to cover\r\nthe cost at the least efficient and least well-equipped establishment\r\nof which the output was needed; the enormous and even unprecedented\r\nprofits made throughout the whole range of business enterprise; the\r\nhelplessness of the consumers, in the mere expectation of shortage,\r\nand their willingness to pay almost any price that was demanded rather\r\nthan go without--combined with the obvious breakdown of capitalist\r\ncompetition as a safeguard of the public which the proceedings under\r\nthe Profiteering Act revealed--all these things co-operated to convince\r\nthe bulk of the wage-earning class, many of the families living on\r\nfixed incomes, and (in spite of the objection to “bureaucratic\r\ncontrol”) some even among business men, that there was practically\r\nno other course open, in the industries and services that were\r\nsufficiently highly developed to render such a course practicable, than\r\na gradual substitution of public for private ownership. This advance\r\nin public opinion is naturally reflected in the passionate support of\r\npublic ownership, with participation of the workers in administration\r\nand control, given by the Trades Union Congress and Labour Party\r\nConference.\r\n\r\nIt will have become clear from our review of the larger conception\r\nnow current of the place of Trade Unionism in the State, that the\r\nTrade Unionist, as such, no longer retains the acquiescent and neutral\r\nattitude towards the two great parties of British politics, nor to the\r\nCapitalist System itself, which characterised the Trade Unionism of\r\nthirty or forty years ago. The object and purpose of the New Unionism\r\nof 1913-19--not without analogy with that of 1830-34, but with a\r\nsignificant difference--cannot be attained without the transformation\r\nof British politics, and the supersession, in one occupation after\r\nanother, of the capitalist profit-maker as the governor and director\r\nof industry. Meanwhile, as a result of the successive attacks upon the\r\nvery existence of Trade Unionism, even in its most limited form, there\r\nhas been growing up a distinct political organisation of the Trade\r\nUnion Movement, aiming at securing the acceptance by the electorate,\r\nas a whole, of a definitely Socialist policy in the administration of\r\nboth home and foreign affairs. It is this formation of a Labour Party,\r\nready for the carrying into effect of the new ideas, that we have now\r\nto describe.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[651] William Abraham (South Wales Miners), J.

The Trade Unionist Minority Report had a\r\nwide circulation as an Independent Labour Party pamphlet. It reads, in\r\n1920, curiously prophetic of the actual legislative and administrative\r\nchanges that have taken place.\r\n\r\n[653] For half a century after the repeal of the Combination Acts in\r\n1824-25 the controversy as to the legal position of Trade Unionism was\r\nalways muddled up, in the minds of lawyers as well as economists and\r\nthe public, with that of physical violence. Because angry strikers here\r\nand there committed assaults, and occasionally destroyed property,\r\nit was habitually assumed, as it still is by some people thinking\r\nthemselves educated, that Trade Unionism practically depended on, and\r\ninevitably involved, personal molestation of one sort or another.\r\nThis led magistrates, right down to 1891, occasionally to regard as\r\na criminal offence, under the head of “intimidation,” any threat or\r\nwarning uttered by a Trade Unionist to an employer or a non-unionist\r\nworkman, even if the consequences alluded to were of the most peaceful\r\nkind. In 1891 a specially constituted Court of the Queen’s Bench\r\nDivision definitely laid it down that “intimidation,” under the Act\r\nof 1875, was confined to the threat of committing a criminal offence\r\nagainst person or tangible property (Memorandum by Sir Frederick\r\nPollock in Appendix to Report of Royal Commission on Labour, C. 7063;\r\nsee also _Law Quarterly Review_, January 1892; _Industrial Democracy_,\r\nby S. and B.

Webb, Introduction to the 1902 edition, pp. xxiv-xxxvi.\r\nIt does not appear that, in the strictly legal sense, the Taff Vale\r\njudgement was unwarranted. Though the Act of 1871 had been supposed to\r\nprevent a Trade Union from being proceeded against, it contained no\r\nexplicit grant of immunity from being made answerable for any damage\r\nthat might be wrongfully caused. In fact, both the 1871 Act and that\r\nof 1876 expressly provided that the registered Trade Union itself\r\nshould be liable to be brought into Court for the petty penalties\r\ninstituted for failure to supply the Registrar with copies of rules\r\nand balance-sheets; and also that the trustees of a registered Union\r\nshould sue and be sued on its behalf. What the Act of 1871 did was to\r\nrelieve the Trade Union from its character of criminality by reason\r\nof its purposes being in restraint of trade, and of its character of\r\nillegality from the same cause; and to prohibit legal proceedings\r\ndirectly to enforce certain agreements among its members, or between\r\nit and its members, or among different Unions. These were assumed to\r\nbe all the cases that could arise. It seems to have been taken for\r\ngranted by the Minority of the Trade Union Commission of 1869, by\r\nthe Home Office in 1870-71, by the Parliament of 1871-76, and the\r\nRoyal Commission on Labour in 1893, that an unincorporated body could\r\nnot be sued for damages in tort any more than for a civil debt. But\r\nin the following years, without any reference to Trade Unionism,\r\nthe Courts successively enlarged their procedure so as to admit of\r\nany group of persons having a common interest being made parties to\r\na “representative action” (Duke of Bedford _v._ Ellis, 1901, A.C.\r\n1, where the tenants of shops in Covent Garden were parties). This\r\nenabled even an unregistered Trade Union to be sued (Yorkshire Miners’\r\nAssociation _v._ Howden, 1905, A.C. 256). In 1893, and again in 1895,\r\nactions against unregistered Trade Union organisations had been\r\nmaintained in the lower Courts (Trollope and Others _v._ The London\r\nBuilding Trades Federation and Others, 1895, 72 L.T. 342; 11 T.L.R.\r\n280; W.N. 45; Pink _v._ The Federation of Trades and Labour Unions,\r\netc., 1893, 67 L.T. 258; 8 T.L.R. 216, 711; 36 S.J. 201). But these had\r\nnot been noticed by the Trade Union Movement as a whole; and they had\r\nnot been seriously defended, not fully argued, and not carried to the\r\nhighest tribunal.\r\n\r\n[657] The number of stoppages through disputes known to the Labour\r\nDepartment of the Board of Trade, which between 1891 and 1899 had never\r\nbeen fewer than 700 in a year, did not again reach this figure for a\r\nwhole decade; and sank in 1903-5--years during which trade was checked,\r\nand some reduction of wages took place--to only half the number. Of the\r\n135 claims to the Strike Benefit admitted by the General Federation of\r\nTrade Unions in 1903, we read that “no less than 130 have been caused\r\nby attempts on the part of employers to encroach upon the recognised\r\nconditions prevailing in the particular trades” (_Fifth Annual Report\r\nof the Federation_, 1904, p. 11).\r\n\r\n[658] In addition, twelve workmen, mostly miners, were elected under\r\nthe auspices of the Liberal Party. Nearly all these came over to the\r\nLabour Party in 1910 (_History of Labour Representation_, by A. W.\r\nHumphrey, 1912).\r\n\r\n[659] _Report of Royal Commission on Trade Disputes and Trade\r\nCombinations_, Cd. 2825.\r\n\r\n[660] 6 Edward VII. c. 47.\r\n\r\n[661] Trade Unionists would be well advised not to presume too far on\r\nthis apparently absolute immunity from legal proceedings. It must not\r\nbe imagined that either the ingenuity of the lawyers or the prejudice\r\nof the judges has been exhausted. It has already been urged that\r\nthe immunity of a Trade Union from being sued should be regarded as\r\nimplicitly limited to acts done in contemplation or furtherance of a\r\ntrade dispute; but such a limitation has so far been negatived (Vacher\r\n_v._ London Society of Compositors, 29 T.R. 73). It is now suggested\r\nthat the immunity might one day be held to be limited to acts committed\r\nby a Trade Union _in the exercise of its specifically Trade Union\r\nfunctions_, or for the “statutory objects” of Trade Unions as defined\r\nby the Act, and not to acts which the Court might hold to be beyond its\r\nlegitimate scope, or not specifically connected with what they might\r\nin their wisdom consider to be the principal purpose of a Trade Union.\r\n(But see Shinwell v. National Sailors’ and Firemen’s Union, 1913, a\r\ndecision of the Scottish Court of Session, limiting the liability of a\r\nUnion to reimburse its trustees for damages incurred by them.) Thus, a\r\nnew Taff Vale case, at a moment when public opinion was exceptionally\r\nhostile to Trade Unionism, is by no means impossible. Similarly, Trade\r\nUnion officials should remember that their privileged position is\r\nconfined to a _trade dispute_, which, as specifically defined in the\r\nAct, _does not include all strikes_; and what limits the Courts might\r\nset to the phrase is uncertain. Moreover, the Trade Disputes Act does\r\nnot repeal other statutes; and Trade Union officials have been fined\r\nfor persuading sailors not to embark, in contravention of the Merchant\r\nShipping Acts. The Trade Disputes Act does not protect officials\r\ncommitting illegalities other than those to which it expressly refers,\r\nor under circumstances other than those indicated.

The Minority Report by Mrs. Sidney Webb was republished by\r\nthe Fabian Society, under the title of _Men’s and Women’s Wages: Should\r\nthey be equal?_, 1919.\r\n\r\n[682] Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act, 1919 (9 and 10 George V.\r\nc. 42). During the first year after the cessation of hostilities the\r\nproblem of restoration did not assume so acute a form as had been\r\nexpected. A large part of the new automatic machinery which had been\r\nintroduced in 1915-18 was found to have been greatly deteriorated\r\nby excessive working and had to be scrapped; there was an immediate\r\ndemand for ordinary engineering work of the old type; and the British\r\nemployers did not, in fact, set themselves at once to apply “mass\r\nproduction” to the making of steam engines and motor cars, agricultural\r\nimplements and machinery generally, nor make any dramatic advances\r\nin its application to the production of sewing-machines, bicycles,\r\nand electrical apparatus. During 1919: the extensive readaptation of\r\nthe machine-shops, and the great demand for new tools (especially\r\nmachine-tools) facilitated the absorption, often in new situations, of\r\nall the skilled engineers. There was, accordingly, little difficulty\r\nin finding employment at good wages for practically all the skilled\r\nworkmen, and (except for temporary dislocations arising in consequence\r\nof the disputes in coalmining, ironfounding, and other trades) the\r\npercentage of members of the Amalgamated Society of Engineers and\r\nother Unions of skilled craftsmen remained throughout the year at a\r\nminimum. The great bulk of the “dilutees,” including substantially all\r\nthe women, received their discharge on the cessation of their jobs\r\nof “repetition work” on munitions of war, the employers preferring,\r\nin face of the immediate demand, to avoid trouble, to revert to the\r\nold methods and to get back their former staffs, rather than engage\r\nin the hazardous enterprise of reorganising their factory methods.\r\nHence, taking the engineering industry as a whole, the men got back the\r\nwork from the women; though not without some attempts at resistance\r\nby individual employers, which were not persisted in; and not without\r\nleaving the total number of women employed in 1920 in what might be\r\ndeemed their own branches of the engineering industry apparently double\r\nthat of 1913. Many of the male “dilutees” on discharge also reverted\r\nto other employment, but some proportion of them, who had acquired\r\nskill, and were members of various Unions admitting semi-skilled\r\nworkers, found employment in engineering shops on particular machines\r\nor in particular jobs. There has apparently been a continuous increase\r\nin the proportion of machines demanding less than full skill (such\r\nas milling machines and small turret lathes), and therefore of\r\n“semi-skilled” men in employment, without (owing to the expansion of\r\nthe industry as a whole) any reduction in the number of skilled men. In\r\nface of the great demand for output, and of the fact that hardly any\r\nmembers of the skilled Unions were unemployed, this fact did not evoke\r\nobjection. The position as regards the Premium Bonus System or other\r\nform of “Payment by Results” was left unchanged. Few, if any, legal\r\nproceedings were actually taken against employers in the Munitions\r\nCourts under the Restoration of Pre-War Practices Act. The employers\r\nand the Government were, during the first half of the year, in a state\r\nof alarm lest there should be a Labour uprising, which would seriously\r\ninterfere with the resumption of business; and great care was exercised\r\nto avoid any disputes. Successive advances of wages were awarded to\r\nmeet the rising cost of living, and all rates were “stabilised” by\r\nlaw, so as to prevent any employer from effecting a reduction, first\r\nuntil May 20, 1919, then until November 20, 1919, and finally until\r\nSeptember 30, 1920; a new “Industrial Court” being set up by statute\r\n(Industrial Courts Act 1919) empowered to give non-obligatory decisions\r\nin any disputes that might be voluntarily referred to it--a measure\r\nfrom which the Parliamentary Labour Party succeeded in eliminating\r\nevery implication of Compulsory Arbitration, Obligatory Awards, or\r\nthe Abrogation of the Right to Strike. But the difficulties are not\r\nyet surmounted; and when there comes a slump in business, and skilled\r\nengineers find themselves unemployed, the Government pledge will be\r\nheard of again.\r\n\r\n[683] See this noted in the report of the Parliamentary Committee in\r\nthe _Annual Report of the Trades Union Congress_, 1917.\r\n\r\n[684] The “Whitley Report,” published early in 1917, when possibilities\r\nof industrial and social “reconstruction” were much discussed, made\r\na great stir, which was increased by the definite endorsement of its\r\nrecommendations by the Government, and its energetic promotion of their\r\nadoption throughout British industry. Whilst significantly abstaining\r\nfrom any suggestion of “profit-sharing, co-partnership, or particular\r\nsystems of wages,” the Report emphasised the importance of (_a_)\r\n“adequate organisation on the part of both employers and employed”;\r\n(_b_) the imperative need for a greater opportunity of participating\r\nin the discussion about and adjustment of “those parts of industry by\r\nwhich they are most affected” of the work-people in each occupation;\r\n(_c_) the subordination of any decisions to those of the Trade Unions\r\nand Employers’ Associations. Among the subjects to be dealt with by\r\nthe hierarchy of National, District, and Works Councils or Committees\r\nwere: (i.) “the better utilisation of the practical knowledge and\r\nexperience of the work-people ... and for securing to them a greater\r\nshare in and responsibility for the determination and observance of the\r\nconditions under which their work is carried on”; (ii.) “the settlement\r\nof the general principles governing the conditions of employment ...\r\nhaving regard to the need for securing to the work-people a share in\r\nthe increased prosperity of the industry”; (iii.) the methods to be\r\nadopted for negotiations, adjusting wages, determining differences\r\nand “ensuring to the work-people the greatest possible security of\r\nearnings and employment”; (iv.) technical education, industrial\r\nresearch, utilisation of inventions, and improvement of processes;\r\n(v.) proposed legislation affecting the industry. After two years’\r\npropagandist effort, it seems (1920) as if the principal industries,\r\nsuch as agriculture, transport, mining, cotton, engineering, or\r\nshipbuilding are unlikely to adopt the scheme; but two or three score\r\ntrades have equipped themselves either with “Whitley Councils”--the\r\nDistrict Councils and Works Committees are much more slow to form--or\r\nwith “Interim Industrial Reconstruction Committees,” which may be\r\nregarded as provisional Councils, in such industries as pottery,\r\nhouse-building, woollen manufacture, hosiery, heavy chemicals,\r\nfurniture-making, bread-baking, match-making, metallic bedstead\r\nmanufacturing, saw-milling, and vehicle building. The Government found\r\nitself constrained, after an obstinate resistance by the heads of\r\nnearly all the departments, to institute the Councils throughout the\r\npublic service. We venture on the prediction that some such scheme\r\nwill commend itself in all nationalised or municipalised industries\r\nand services, including such as may be effectively “controlled” by the\r\nGovernment, though remaining nominally the property of the private\r\ncapitalist--possibly also in the Co-operative Movement; but that it is\r\nnot likely to find favour either in the well-organised industries (for\r\nwhich alone it was devised) or in those in which there are Trade Boards\r\nlegally determining wages, etc.; or, indeed, permanently in any others\r\nconducted under the system of capitalist profit-making. See the series\r\nof “Whitley Reports,” Cd. 8606, 9001, 9002, 9085, 9099, and 9153; the\r\nIndustrial Reports, Nos. 1 to 4, of the Ministry of Reconstruction;\r\nthe able and well-informed article, “La politique de paix sociale\r\nen Angleterre,” by Élie Halévy, in _Revue d’Économie Politique_,\r\nNo. 4 of 1919; _Recommendation on the Whitley Report put forward by\r\nthe Federation of British Industries_, 1917; _National Guilds or\r\nWhitley Councils?_ (National Guilds League), 1918. For the “Builders’\r\nParliament,” in many ways the most interesting of these Councils,\r\nthough as yet achieving only schemes in which the employers, as a\r\nwhole, do not concur, see _A Memorandum on Industrial Self-Government_,\r\nby Malcolm Sparkes; _Masters and Men, a new Co-partnership_, by Thomas\r\nFoster; and _The Industrial Council for the Building Industry_, by the\r\nGarton Foundation, 1919.\r\n\r\n[685] It must be remembered that the conditions of the manual worker’s\r\nlife dealt with by the Trade Unions up to 1894 included a wide\r\nrange of material circumstances and moral considerations. Besides\r\nthe maintenance of standard rates and methods of remuneration, the\r\nreduction of the normal day, and payment for overtime, we find\r\namong the objects of Trade Unions, as reported to the Commission,\r\nthe prevention of stoppages from wages; the maintenance of the\r\napprenticeship system and the keeping out of the trade all who are\r\nnot qualified; the abolition of the character note; the prevention of\r\nvictimisation; the provision of legal assistance to members in respect\r\nof compensation for accidents; the establishment of an agency through\r\nwhich employers may obtain efficient men; watching over the proceedings\r\nof local boards and law courts; the enforcement of the Factory Acts and\r\nother protective legislative enactments; the improvement of dietary\r\nscales and house and shop accommodation where workers have to live in;\r\nthe collection and circulation of information on trade matters; the\r\nestablishment of benefit funds for unemployment, disputes, sickness,\r\naccidents and death; the assistance of members anxious to migrate\r\nor emigrate; the establishment of “that reciprocal confidence which\r\nis so essential between workmen and masters,” and the promotion of\r\narbitration and conciliation; the regulation of output; the promotion\r\nof friendly intercourse with workers of other countries; the assistance\r\nof other trades in times of difficulty; and political action--the\r\nsupport of Parliamentary and Municipal Labour candidates, of Trades\r\nCouncils, of the Trades Union Congress, and of Labour newspapers.\r\nSome Unions decide to promote co-operative enterprise, “to secure the\r\nlegal recognition of the natural rights of labourers to the produce of\r\ntheir toil,” whilst others promote the “moral, social, intellectual\r\nand professional advancement” of the working class. “Trade Societies,”\r\nstate the rules of the Associated Shipwrights, “must be maintained as\r\nthe guard of workmen against capitalists until some higher effort of\r\nproductive co-operation has been inaugurated which shall secure to\r\nworkers a more equitable share of the product of labour.”\r\n\r\n[686] _Minutes of Evidence, Royal Commission on Labour_: “Report of\r\nEvidence from Co-operative Societies and Public Officials,” 1893, C\r\n7063-1 (Q 2098, 2117-8).\r\n\r\nMr. Tom Mann was also in favour of the Consumers’ Co-operative\r\nMovement, and had in those days a distinct bias for legal enactment\r\nover direct action in determining the conditions of employment. “I\r\nshould have said,” he stated in the witness-chair, “that I, as a Trade\r\nUnionist, am of opinion that in my capacity of citizen I have just\r\nas full a right to use Parliament for the general betterment of the\r\nconditions of the workers, of whom I am one, as I have to use the\r\nTrade Union; and when I could use the institution of Parliament to do\r\nthat constructive work that I sometimes use the Trade Union for, and\r\ncould use Parliament more effectively than I could the Trade Union,\r\nthen I should favour the use of Parliament, not necessarily in order\r\nto enforce men to do something which they might not wish to do, but\r\nbecause it was the more effective instrument to use to bring about\r\nchanged conditions” (_Ibid._ Q 2531).\r\n\r\n[687] An interesting sidelight is afforded by the reprobation by the\r\nGerman Social Democratic Party, in 1894, of Eduard Bernstein for\r\ntranslating our _History of Trade Unionism_, on the ground that Trade\r\nUnionism had no place in the Socialist State, and that it was needless\r\nto trouble about it!\r\n\r\n[688] See, for convenient summaries, _Syndicalism in France_, by Louis\r\nLevine, 1911, and _What Syndicalism Means_, by S. and B.

We are\r\nconcerned, in this volume, only with the effect of these new movements\r\nof working-class thought upon British Trade Unionism, and this is not\r\nthe occasion for any complete appreciation of Syndicalism or Industrial\r\nUnionism. The Syndicalist Movement in this country had died down\r\nprior to the war, but the Industrial Unionist Movement simmered on in\r\nthe Clyde district and in South Wales. Its chief organisation is the\r\nSocialist Labour Party, which is not, and has never been, connected\r\neither with any other Socialist organisation in this country or with\r\nthe Labour Party that is described in the next chapter. It was, we\r\nthink, the moving spirits of the Socialist Labour Party who were, as\r\nTrade Unionist workmen, mainly responsible for the aggressive action\r\nof the Clyde Workers Committee between 1915 and 1918, and also for\r\nthe rise of the Shop Stewards Movement, and for its spread from the\r\nClyde to English engineering centres. At the present moment (1920) the\r\nSocialist Labour Party, owing to the personal qualities of its leading\r\nspirits, J. T. Murphy and A. MacManus, holds the leading position\r\nin this school of thought, which received a great impulse from the\r\naccession of Lenin to power in Russia. But it remains a ferment rather\r\nthan a statistically important element in the Trade Union world.\r\n\r\n[694] The revival of the Owenite proposal to develop existing Trade\r\nUnions into great Associations of Producers for the carrying on of\r\neach industry must be attributed perhaps to Mr. A. J. Penty (_The\r\nRestoration of the Gild System_, 1906), or to Mr. A. R. Orage, aided\r\nby Mr. S. G. Hobson, in a series of articles in _The New Age_, 1911\r\n(afterwards published in a volume, _National Guilds_, 1913, edited by\r\nA. R. Orage). But _The New Age_ had a limited circulation in the Trade\r\nUnion world, and the plan proposed was not worked out in detail. The\r\nidea was afterwards developed by Mr. G. D. H. Cole and his associates,\r\nand widely promulgated in the Trade Union world. An organisation for\r\nthis propaganda, the National Guilds’ League, was started in 1915, and\r\nhas now a membership of several hundred, amongst whom are included\r\nsome of the younger leaders of the Trade Union Movement. It publishes\r\na monthly, _The Guildsman_, edited by Mr. and Mrs. G. D. H. Cole.\r\nThe various books by Mr. Cole--especially _The World of Labour_,\r\n_Self-Government in Industry_, and _Labour in the Commonwealth_--should\r\nalso be consulted.\r\n\r\n[695] _N.U.R. Agenda and Decisions of the Annual General Meeting_, June\r\n1914, p. 7.\r\n\r\n[696] The resolution runs as follows: “That in view of the success\r\nwhich, in spite of unparalleled difficulties, has attended the\r\nworking of the railways under State control, this Congress urge the\r\nParliamentary Congress to press the Government to arrange for the\r\ncomplete nationalisation of all the railways, and to place them under\r\na Minister of Railways, who shall be responsible to Parliament, and\r\n_be assisted by national and local advisory committees, upon which the\r\norganised railway workers shall be adequately represented_” (_Trades\r\nUnion Congress Annual Report_, 1917, p. 345).\r\n\r\n[697] _Postal and Telegraph Record_, May 22, 1919, p. 237.\r\n\r\n[698] _Ibid._\r\n\r\n[699] _The Nationalisation of Mines Bill_ (Fabian Tract, No. 171, 1913).\r\n\r\n[700] The Nationalisation of Mines and Minerals Bill, 1919, given\r\nin full in _Further Facts from the Coal Commission_, by R.

The Miners’ Federation Conference of 1918 had passed the\r\nfollowing resolution: “That in the opinion of this Conference the\r\ntime has arrived in the history of the coal-mining industry when it\r\nis clearly in the national interests to transfer the entire industry\r\nfrom private ownership and control to State ownership with joint\r\ncontrol and administration by the workmen and the State. In pursuance\r\nof this opinion the National Executive be instructed to immediately\r\nreconsider the draft Bill for the Nationalisation of the Mines ... in\r\nthe light of the newer phases of development in the industry, so as\r\nto make provision for the aforesaid joint control and administration\r\nwhen the measure becomes law; further, a Conference be called at an\r\nearly date to receive a report from the Executive Committee upon the\r\ndraft proposals and to determine the best means of co-operating with\r\nthe National Labour Party to ensure the passage of a new Bill into\r\nlaw” (_Report of Annual Conference of the Miners’ Federation of Great\r\nBritain_, July 9, 1918, p. 44).\r\n\r\n[701] At the end of our chapter on the “Method of Collective\r\nBargaining” we cursorily dealt with the strike as a necessary incident\r\nof collective bargaining: “It is impossible to deny that the perpetual\r\nliability to end in a strike or a lock-out is a grave drawback to the\r\nMethod of Collective Bargaining. So long as the parties to a bargain\r\nare free to agree or not to agree, it is inevitable that, human\r\nnature being as it is, there should now and again come a deadlock,\r\nleading to that trial of strength and endurance which lies behind all\r\nbargaining. We know of no device for avoiding this trial of strength\r\nexcept a deliberate decision of the community expressed in legislative\r\nenactment” (_Industrial Democracy_, p. 221).\r\n\r\n[702] See, for instance, _Trade Unionism New and Old_, by George\r\nHowell, 1891.\r\n\r\n[703] Mr. G.

A more explicit statement of Mr.\r\nHodges’ views will be found in his speech at the Annual Conference\r\nof the Miners’ Federation in July 1918: “For the last two or three\r\nyears a new movement has sprung up in the labour world which deals\r\nwith the question of joint control of the industry by representatives\r\nfrom the side which represents, for the most part, the consumer, and\r\nrepresentatives of the workmen, who are the producers. Nationalisation\r\nin the old sense is no longer attractive. As a matter of fact, you can\r\nhave nationalisation, but still be in no better position than you are\r\nnow under private ownership. That is the experience of institutions\r\nwhich have been State owned and State controlled for many years. The\r\nmost remarkable scheme worked out during the last year is the theory\r\nworked out by the ... Postmen’s Federation. He has endeavoured to\r\nprovide a scheme by which the postal workers should have a definite\r\namount of control, a definite form of control, in the postal service,\r\nand in working it out he has demonstrated beyond all doubt how at every\r\npoint he is up against the power of the bureaucrats, as exemplified\r\nby the State. Now, is it any good to have these mines nationalised\r\nunless we are going to exercise some form of control as producers? If\r\nnot, the whole tendency will be towards the power of bureaucracy. We\r\nshall be given no status at all in the industry, except to be the mere\r\nproducers, as we have been in the past years. Under State ownership\r\nthe workmen should be desirous of having something more than the mere\r\nquestion of wages or the mere consideration of employment; the workmen\r\nshould have some directive power in the industry in which they are\r\nengaged. Now, how are we going to have this directive power under\r\nState control? I think we must admit that the side representing the\r\nconsumers (the State) should have some form of control on property\r\nwhich will be State property, and when a national industry becomes\r\nState controlled you must have permanent officials to look after the\r\nconsumers’ interests, and from the purely producers’ point of view\r\nthe Miners’ Federation must represent the producers in the central\r\nauthority and in the decentralised authority, right down to the\r\nseparate collieries. Are we ready to do this? Are we prepared for this,\r\nstarting at the separate collieries, indicating how the industry is to\r\nbe developed locally? Men must take their share in understanding all\r\nthe relations embodied in the export side of the trade; they must take\r\na share even in controlling the banking arrangements which govern the\r\nfinancial side of the industry, and with that comes a very great deal\r\nof responsibility. Now, are we prepared to assume that responsibility,\r\na responsibility which is implied in the term workmen’s control? It is\r\ngoing to be a big task and a test of the educational attainments of the\r\nminers themselves if they assume control of the industry, and if it did\r\nnot thrive under that control there is the possibility we should have\r\nto hark back to private ownership in order to make it successful....\r\nI hold these views, and unless they are accompanied by an effective\r\nform of working-class control, I do not believe that nationalisation\r\nwill do any good for anybody” (_Report of Annual Conference of the\r\nMiners’ Federation of Great Britain, July 9, 1918_, pp. 49-51).\r\n\r\n[706] Report of the Committee on Combinations and Trusts, 1919.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\nPOLITICAL ORGANISATION\r\n\r\n[1900-1920]\r\n\r\n\r\nFifty years ago, when Professor Brentano described the British Trade\r\nUnion Movement with greater knowledge and insight than any one else\r\nhad then shown,[707] nothing seemed more unlikely than that the\r\nMovement would become organised as an independent political party,\r\nappealing to the whole electorate on a general programme, returning\r\nits own contingent of members to the House of Commons, and asserting\r\na claim, as soon as that contingent should become the strongest party\r\nin Parliament, to constitute a national administration. For nearly a\r\nquarter of a century more, as we have described in a previous chapter,\r\nthough Trade Unionism was making itself slowly more and more felt in\r\npolitics, it was still possible for economists and statesmen to believe\r\nthat “Labour” in Great Britain would organise only to maintain its\r\nsectional industrial interests, and that it would impinge on politics,\r\nif at all, only occasionally, in defence of Trade Unionism itself,\r\nor in support of some particular project of industrial law. By 1894,\r\nwhen the first edition of this book was published, there was already\r\nmanifest, as we then stated, a great shifting of Trade Union opinion on\r\nthe\r\n\r\n “pressing question of the position to be taken by the\r\n Trade Union world in the party struggles of To-day and the\r\n politics of To-morrow. In our chapter on ‘The Old Unionism\r\n and the New,’ we described the rapid conversion of the\r\n superior workman to the general principles of Collectivism.\r\n This revolution of opinion in the rank and file has been\r\n followed by a marked change of front on the part of the\r\n salaried officials, and by a growing distrust of the\r\n aristocratic and middle-class representatives of both the\r\n great political parties. To the working-man politician\r\n of 1894 it seems inconceivable that either landlords or\r\n capitalists will actively help him to nationalise land and\r\n mining royalties, to absorb unearned incomes by taxation,\r\n or to control private enterprise in the interests of the\r\n wage-earner. Thus we find throughout the whole Trade Union\r\n world an almost unanimous desire to make the working-class\r\n organisations in some way effective for political purposes.\r\n Nor is this a new thing. The sense of solidarity has, as we\r\n have seen, never been lacking among those active soldiers\r\n and non-commissioned officers who constitute the most\r\n vital element in the Trade Union army. The generous aid\r\n from trade to trade, the pathetic attempts to form General\r\n Unions, the constant aspirations after universal federation,\r\n all testify to the reality and force of this instinctive\r\n solidarity. The Collectivist faith of the ‘New Unionism’ is\r\n only another manifestation of the same deep-rooted belief in\r\n the essential Brotherhood of Labour. But, as we have seen,\r\n the basis of the association of these million and a half\r\n wage-earners is, primarily, sectional in its nature. They\r\n come together, and contribute their pence, for the defence\r\n of their interests as Boilermakers, Miners, Cotton-spinners,\r\n and not directly for the advancement of the whole working\r\n class. Among the salaried officers of the Unions, it is,\r\n as we have said, the Trade Official, chosen and paid for\r\n the express purpose of maintaining the interests of his own\r\n particular trade, who is the active force. The effect has\r\n been to intensify the sectionalism to which an organisation\r\n based on trades must necessarily be prone. The vague\r\n general Collectivism of the non-commissioned officers has\r\n hitherto got translated into practical proposals only in so\r\n far as it can be expressed in projects for the advantage\r\n of a particular trade. Some organised trades have known\r\n how to draft and to extort from Parliament a voluminous\r\n Labour Code, the provisions of which are exceptionally\r\n well adapted for the protection of the particular workers\r\n concerned. The ‘particulars clause’[708] and the law against\r\n the ‘over-steaming’ of weaving sheds are, for instance,\r\n triumphs of collective control which could hardly have been\r\n conceived by any one except the astute trade officials of\r\n the Cotton Operatives. But there is no attempt to deal with\r\n any question as a whole. Trade Unionists are, for instance,\r\n unanimously in favour of drastic legislation to put down\r\n ‘sweating’ in all trades whatsoever. But no salaried officer\r\n of the Trade Union world feels it to be his business to\r\n improve the Labour Code for any industry but his own. Thus,\r\n whereas the Factory Acts have been effectively elaborated to\r\n meet the special circumstances of a few trades, for all the\r\n rest they remain in the form of merely general prohibitions\r\n which it is practically impossible to enforce. How far it is\r\n possible, by the development of Trades Councils, the reform\r\n of the Trades Union Congress, the increased efficiency of\r\n the Parliamentary Committee, the growth of Trade Union\r\n representation in the House of Commons, or, finally, by the\r\n creation of any new federal machinery, to counteract the\r\n fundamental sectionalism of Trade Union organisation, to\r\n supplement the specialised trade officials by an equally\r\n specialised Civil Service of working-class politicians,\r\n and thus to render the Trade Union world, with its million\r\n of electors, and its leadership of Labour, an effective\r\n political force in the State, is, on the whole, the most\r\n momentous question of contemporary politics.”[709]\r\n\r\nThe quarter of a century that has elapsed since these words were\r\nwritten has seen an extensive political development of the Trade Union\r\nMovement, taking the form of building up a separate and independent\r\nparty of “Labour” in the House of Commons, which we have now to\r\nrecord.[710]\r\n\r\nThe continued propaganda of the Socialists, and of others who wished to\r\nsee the Trade Union Movement become an effective political force, which\r\nwe have described as active from 1884 onwards, did not, for nearly a\r\ncouple of decades, produce a political “Labour Party.” So strong was\r\nat that time the resistance of most of the Trade Union leaders to any\r\nparticipation of their societies in general politics, even on the lines\r\nof complete independence of both Liberal and Conservative Parties,\r\nthat “Labour Representation” had still, for some years, to be fought\r\nfor apart from Trade Unionism. The leaders, indeed, did not really\r\ncare about Trade Union influence in the House of Commons.[711] Many\r\nof them, as we have described, remained for a whole generation averse\r\neven from legal regulation of the conditions of employment. In national\r\npolitics they were mostly Liberals, with the strongest possible\r\nadmiration for Gladstone and Bright; or else (as in Lancashire)\r\nconvinced Conservatives, concerned to defend the Church of England or\r\nRoman Catholic elementary schools in which their children were being\r\neducated or carried away by the glamour of an Imperialist foreign\r\npolicy. They asked for nothing more than a few working-class members in\r\nthe House of Commons, belonging to one or other of the “respectable”\r\nparties, to which they could thus obtain access for the adjustment of\r\nany matters in which their societies happened to be interested.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, at his first appearance at the Trades Union Congress, J. Keir\r\nHardie,[712] representing a small Union of Ayrshire Miners, demanded a\r\nnew start. He called upon the Trade Unionists definitely to sever their\r\nconnection with the existing political parties, by which the workmen\r\nwere constantly befooled and betrayed, and insisted on the necessity\r\nof forming an entirely independent party of Labour, to which the whole\r\nworking-class movement should rally. On the Congress he produced no\r\napparent effect.[713] But, six months later, when a Parliamentary\r\nvacancy occurred in Mid-Lanark, Keir Hardie was nominated, against\r\nLiberal and Tory alike, on the principle of entire independence; and\r\nin spite of every effort to induce him to withdraw,[714] he went to\r\nthe poll, obtaining only 619 votes. A society was then formed to\r\nwork for independent Labour representation, under the designation of\r\nthe Scottish Labour Party, having for chairman Mr. R. B. Cunninghame\r\nGraham, M.P., who had been elected as a Liberal but who had become a\r\nSocialist. The “new spirit” of 1889, which we have described, put heart\r\ninto the movement for political independence; and after much further\r\npropaganda by the Socialists,[715] at the General Election of 1892 Keir\r\nHardie was elected for West Ham, avowedly as the first member of an\r\nindependent Party of Labour; together with fourteen other workmen,[716]\r\nwhose independence of the Liberal Party, even where it was claimed,\r\nwas less marked than their obvious jealousy of Keir Hardie. There was\r\napparently still no hope of gaining the adherence of the Trade Unions\r\nas such; and at the Glasgow Trades Union Congress of 1892 arrangements\r\nwere made by a few of the delegates to hold a smaller conference, which\r\ntook place at Bradford, in 1893, under the chairmanship of Keir Hardie,\r\nwhen those who were determined to establish a separate political party\r\nformed a society, made up of individual adherents, which was styled the\r\nIndependent Labour Party. In this the Scottish Labour Party was merged,\r\nbut it remained without the affiliation of Trade Unions in their\r\ncorporate capacity. The Independent Labour Party, of which throughout\r\nhis life Keir Hardie was the outstanding figure, carried on a strenuous\r\npropagandist campaign, and during the next two years put up independent\r\ncandidates at by-elections, with uniform ill-success. At the General\r\nElection of 1895, no fewer than twenty-eight “I.L.P.” candidates\r\nwent to the poll, every one of them (including Keir Hardie himself\r\nat West Ham) being unsuccessful. With two or three exceptions, the\r\nTrade Unionist members in alliance with the Liberal Party successfully\r\nmaintained their seats. The establishment of an aggressively\r\nindependent Labour Party in Parliament still looked hopeless.\r\n\r\nWith the new century an effort was made on fresh lines. The continuous\r\npropaganda had had its effect, even on the Trades Union Congress.\r\nIn 1898 it could be suggested in the presidential address[717] that\r\na “committee should be appointed to draft a scheme of political\r\norganisation for the Trade Union world on the ground that just as\r\ntrades federation is a matter of vital necessity for industrial\r\norganisation, so also will a scheme of political action be of vital\r\nnecessity if we wish Parliament to faithfully register the effect of\r\nthe industrial revolution on our social life.” The very next year a\r\nresolution--which had been drafted in London by the members of the\r\nIndependent Labour Party--was carried on the motion of the Amalgamated\r\nSociety of Railway Servants, against the votes of the miners as well as\r\nof the textile workers, directing the convening of a special congress\r\nrepresenting Trade Unions, Co-operative Societies, and Socialist\r\norganisations, in order to devise means of increasing the number of\r\nLabour members.[718] It was urged on the Parliamentary Committee that\r\nthe Socialist organisations had a right to be strongly represented on\r\nthe proposed Committee; and the Parliamentary Committee, which had no\r\nfaith in the scheme and attached little importance to it, nominated\r\nfour of its members (S. Woods, W. C. Steadman, R. Bell, and W. Thorne),\r\nall of whom afterwards became Members of Parliament, to sit with two\r\nrepresentatives each from the Independent Labour Party (Keir Hardie\r\nand J. Ramsay MacDonald), the Fabian Society (G. Bernard Shaw and E.\r\nR. Pease), and the Social Democratic Federation (H. Quelch and H. R.\r\nTaylor). This Committee took the business into its own hands, and drew\r\nup a constitution, upon a federal basis, for a “Labour Representation\r\nCommittee,” as an independent organisation, including Trade Unions\r\nand Trades Councils, along with Co-operative and Socialist Societies;\r\nand in February 1900 a specially summoned congress, attended by 129\r\ndelegates, representing Trade Unions aggregating half a million\r\nmembers, and Socialist societies claiming fewer than seventy thousand,\r\nadopted the draft constitution, established the new body, appointed its\r\nfirst executive, and gave it, in Mr. J. Ramsay MacDonald, not merely\r\nits first secretary but also a skilful organiser, to whose patient and\r\npersistent effort no small part of its subsequent success has been due.\r\n\r\nFor two years the Labour Representation Committee, in spite of diligent\r\npropaganda among Trade Union Executives, seemed to hang fire. The\r\nGeneral Election of 1900 found it unprepared; and, though it put\r\nfifteen candidates in the field, only two of them were successful.\r\nNo Co-operative Society joined; the Social Democratic Federation\r\nwithdrew; scarcely a score of Trades Councils were enrolled; and though\r\nsixty-five separate Trade Unions gradually adhered--being only about\r\nfive or six per cent of the total number--the aggregate affiliated\r\nmembership of the Party did not reach half a million. Then the tide\r\nturned, mainly through the rally of Trade Unionism as it became aware\r\nof the full implications of the assault upon it made by the decision in\r\nthe Taff Vale case, which we have already described. The miners stood\r\naloof only because they preferred to use their own organisation. In\r\n1901 the Miners’ Federation voted a levy of a penny per month on all\r\nits membership in order to create a Parliamentary Fund; and the running\r\nof as many as seventy candidates was then talked about. During the year\r\n1902 the number of adhering Trade Unions and Trades Councils, and the\r\ntotal affiliated membership, were alike practically doubled. In the\r\nnext two years the Committee contested no fewer than six Parliamentary\r\nby-elections, returning its members in half of them.[719] Meanwhile\r\nthe Conservative Government obstinately refused to allow legislation\r\nrestoring to Trade Unions the statutory status of 1871-76, of which\r\nthe judges’ decision in the Taff Vale case had deprived them. Careful\r\npreparation was accordingly made for a successful appeal to Trade\r\nUnionists at the General Election which was approaching; and when\r\nit came, in January 1906, no fewer than fifty independent Labour\r\ncandidates were put in the field against Liberals and Conservatives\r\nalike. To the general surprise of the political world, as many as\r\ntwenty-nine of these were successful; besides a dozen other workmen,\r\nmostly miners, who again stood with Liberal Party support and were\r\nstill regarded as belonging to that Party. The twenty-nine at once\r\nformed themselves into, and were recognised as, a separate independent\r\nparty in the House of Commons, with its own officers and whips,\r\nconcerned to push its own programme irrespective of the desires and\r\nconvenience of the other political parties. At the same time the Labour\r\nRepresentation Committee changed its name to the Labour Party.\r\n\r\nWe need not concern ourselves with the Parliamentary struggles of the\r\nnext three years, during which the Parliamentary Labour Party may claim\r\nto have indirectly secured the passage, as Government measures, of the\r\nTrade Disputes Act, the Miners’ Eight Hours Act, and the Trade Boards\r\nAct, and to have developed something like a Parliamentary programme.\r\nIt suffered, however, in the Trade Union world, from its inevitable\r\nfailure to impress its will on the triumphant Liberal majority of\r\nthese years. What saved the Labour Party from decline, and gave it\r\nindeed fresh impetus in the Trade Union movement, was the renewed legal\r\nassault on Trade Unionism itself, which in 1909, as we have described,\r\nculminated in the Osborne Judgement of the highest Appeal Court, by\r\nwhich the Trade Unions were prohibited from applying any of their\r\nfunds to political activities and to the support of the Labour Party\r\nin particular. The refusal of the Liberal Government for four whole\r\nyears to remedy this gross miscarriage of justice though conscious that\r\nit was not permanently defensible; and the unconcealed desire of the\r\nLiberal Party politicians to put the Labour Party out of action as an\r\nindependent political force, swung over to its side the great bulk of\r\nactive Trade Unionists, including many, especially in Lancashire, who\r\nhad hitherto counted to the Conservative Party. By 1913, in spite of a\r\nlarge number of injunctions restraining Trade Unions from affiliating,\r\nthe Labour Party could count on a membership of nearly two millions,\r\nand this number has since steadily grown. The two General Elections\r\nof 1910, though dominated by other issues, left the Parliamentary\r\nLabour Party unshaken; whilst the accession to the Party of the Miners’\r\nmembers raised its Parliamentary strength to forty-two. Payment of\r\nmembers was secured in 1911, and the Mines (Minimum Wage) Act in 1912,\r\nbut not until 1913 could the Government be induced to pass into law\r\nthe Trade Union Act, which once more permitted Trade Unions to engage\r\nin any lawful purposes that their members desired. This concession\r\nwas, even then, made subject to any objecting member being enabled\r\nto withhold that part of his contribution applicable to political\r\npurposes--an illogical restriction, because it applied only to the\r\ndissentient’s tiny fraction of money, and he was not empowered to\r\nprevent the majority of members from using the indivisible corporate\r\npower of the Union itself. This restriction, not put upon any other\r\ncorporate body, was universally believed to have been imposed, in the\r\nassumed interest of the Liberal Party, with the object of crippling\r\nthe political influence of Trade Unionism; and is still bitterly\r\nresented.[720]\r\n\r\nWhilst it was very largely the successive assaults on Trade Unionism\r\nitself that built up the Labour Party, the ultimate defeat of these\r\nassaults, the concession of Payment of Members, and the attainment of\r\nlegal security by the Trade Union Act of 1913, did nothing to stay its\r\nprogress. At the same time, the injunctions of the years 1909-12,\r\nand the fear of litigation, together with a certain disillusionment\r\nwith Parliamentary action among the rank and file, led to the gradual\r\nfalling away of some Trade Unions, mostly of comparatively small\r\nmembership. The very basis of the Labour Party, upon which alone it\r\nhas proved possible to build up a successful political force--the\r\ncombination, within a political federation, of Trade Unions having\r\nextensive membership and not very intense political energy, and\r\nSocialist societies of relatively scanty membership but overflowing\r\nwith political talent and zeal--necessarily led to complications. It\r\nneeded all the tact and patient persuasion of the leaders of both\r\nsections to convince the Socialists that their ideals and projects were\r\nnot being sacrificed to the stolidity and the prejudices of the mass of\r\nTrade Unionists; and at the same time to explain to the Trade Unionists\r\nhow valuable was the aid of the knowledge, eloquence, and Parliamentary\r\nability contributed by such Socialist representatives as Keir Hardie,\r\nPhilip Snowden, J. Ramsay MacDonald, and W. C. Anderson. Moreover, the\r\ncomplications and difficulties of Parliamentary action in a House of\r\nCommons where the Government continuously possessed a solid majority;\r\nthe political necessity of supporting the Liberal Party Bills relating\r\nto the Budget and the House of Lords, and of not playing into the hands\r\nof a still more reactionary Front Opposition Bench, were not readily\r\ncomprehended by the average workman. What the militants in the country\r\nfailed to allow for was the impotence of a small Parliamentary section\r\nto secure the adoption of its own policy by a Parliamentary majority.\r\nBut it is, we think, now admitted that it was a misfortune that the\r\nParliamentary Labour Party of these years never managed to put before\r\nthe country the large outlines of an alternative programme based on the\r\nParty’s conception of a new social order, eliminating the capitalist\r\nprofit-maker wherever possible, and giving free scope to communal and\r\nindustrial Democracy--notably with regard to the administration of\r\nthe railways and the mines, the prevention of Unemployment, and also\r\nthe provision for the nation’s non-effectives, which the Government\r\ndealt with so unsatisfactorily in the National Insurance Act of 1911.\r\nThe failure of the Parliamentary Labour Party between 1910 and 1914\r\nto strike the imagination of the Trade Union world led to a certain\r\nreaction against political action as such, and to a growing doubt among\r\nthe active spirits as to the value of a Labour Party which did not\r\nsucceed in taking vigorous independent action, either in Parliament\r\nor on the platform and in the press, along the lines of changing the\r\nexisting order of society. A like failure to strike the imagination\r\ncharacterised _The Daily Citizen_--the organ which the Labour Party and\r\nthe Trade Union Movement had established with such high hopes--and its\r\ninability to gain either intellectual influence or adequate circulation\r\ndid not lighten the somewhat gloomy atmosphere of the Labour Party\r\ncouncils of 1913-14.[721] This reaction did not appreciably affect the\r\nnumerical and financial strength of the Labour Party itself, as the\r\nrelatively few withdrawals of Unions were outweighed by the steady\r\nincrease in membership of the hundred principal Unions which remained\r\nfaithful, by the accession of other Unions, and by the continual\r\nincrease in the number and strength of the affiliated Trades Councils\r\nand Local Labour Parties. But the reaction in Trade Union opinion\r\nweakened the influence of the members of the Parliamentary Party,\r\nalike in the House of Commons and in their own societies. A wave of\r\n“Labour Unrest,” of “Syndicalism,” of “rank and file movements” for\r\na more aggressive Trade Unionism, of organisation by “shop stewards”\r\nin opposition to national executives, and of preference for “Direct\r\nAction” over Parliamentary procedure swept over British Trade Unionism,\r\naffecting especially the London building trades, the South Wales\r\nMiners, and the engineering and shipbuilding industry on the Clyde.\r\nThe impetuous strikes in 1911-13 of the Railwaymen, the Coal-miners,\r\nthe Transport Workers, and the London Building Trades, which we have\r\nalready described, were influenced, partly, by this new spirit. The\r\nnumber of disputes reported to the Labour Department, which had sunk\r\nin 1908 to only 399, rose in 1911 to 903, and culminated in the latter\r\nhalf of 1913 and the first half of 1914 in the outbreak of something\r\nlike a hundred and fifty strikes per month. British Trade Unionism was,\r\nin fact, in the summer of 1914, working up for an almost revolutionary\r\noutburst of gigantic industrial disputes, which could not have failed\r\nto be seriously embarrassing for the political organisation to which\r\nthe movement had committed itself, when, in August 1914, war was\r\ndeclared, and all internal conflict had perforce to be suspended.\r\n\r\nDuring the war (1914-18) the task of the Labour Party was one of\r\nexceptional difficulty. It had necessarily to support the Government in\r\na struggle of which five-sixths of its Parliamentary representatives\r\nand probably nine-tenths of its aggregate membership approved. The very\r\ngravity of the national crisis compelled the Party to abstain from any\r\naction that would have weakened the country’s defence. On the other\r\nhand, the three successive Administrations that held office during the\r\nwar were all driven by their needs, as we have already described, to\r\nimpose upon the wage-earners cruel sacrifices, and to violate, not\r\nonce but repeatedly, all that Organised Labour in Britain held dear.\r\nThe Party could not refrain, at whatever cost of misconstruction, from\r\nwithstanding unjustifiable demands by the Government;[722] protesting\r\nagainst its successive breaches of faith to the Trade Unions; demanding\r\nthe conditions in the forthcoming Treaty of Peace that, as could be\r\nalready foreseen, would be necessary to protect the wage-earning class;\r\nstanding up for the scandalously ill-used “conscientious objectors,”\r\nand doing its best to secure, in the eventual demobilisation and\r\nsocial reconstruction, the utmost possible protection of the mass of\r\nthe people against Unemployment and “Profiteering.” In all this the\r\nLabour Party earned the respect of the most thoughtful Trade Unionists,\r\nbut necessarily exposed itself to a constant stream of newspaper\r\nmisrepresentation and abuse. Any opposition or resistance to the\r\nofficial demands was inevitably misrepresented as, and mistaken for, an\r\nalmost treasonable “Pacifism” or “Defeatism”--a misunderstanding of the\r\nattitude of the Party to which colour was lent by the persistence and\r\neloquence with which the small Pacifist Minority within the Party--a\r\nminority which, it must be said, included some of the most talented\r\nand active of its leading members in the House of Commons--used every\r\nopportunity publicly to denounce the Government’s conduct in the war.\r\nBut although the Pacifist Group in Parliament was strenuously supported\r\nin the country by the relatively small but extremely active constituent\r\nsociety of the Labour Party styled The Independent Labour Party--the\r\nvery name helping the popular misunderstanding--the Trade Unionists,\r\nforming the vast majority of the Labour Party, remained, with extremely\r\nfew exceptions, grimly determined at all costs to win the war.\r\n\r\nIf Organised Labour had been against the war, it is safe to say that\r\nthe national effort could not have been maintained. The need for the\r\nformal association of the Labour Party with the Administration was\r\nrecognised by Mr. Asquith in 1915, when he formed the first Coalition\r\nCabinet, into which he invited the chairman of the Parliamentary Labour\r\nParty, Mr. Arthur Henderson (Friendly Society of Ironfounders), who\r\nbecame President of the Board of Education. Later on, in 1916, Mr. G.\r\nN. Barnes (Amalgamated Society of Engineers) was appointed to the new\r\noffice of Minister of Pensions. When, in December 1916, Mr. Asquith\r\nresigned, and Mr. Lloyd George formed a new Coalition Government, Mr.\r\nHenderson entered the small War Cabinet that was then formed, with\r\nthe nominal office of Paymaster-General; whilst Mr. Barnes continued\r\nMinister of Pensions, Mr. John Hodge (British Steel Smelters’ Society)\r\nwas appointed to the new office of Minister of Labour, and three other\r\nmembers of the Party (Mr. W. Brace, South Wales Miners; Mr. G. H.\r\nRoberts, Typographical Society; and Mr. James Parker, National Union of\r\nGeneral Workers) received minor ministerial posts.[723]\r\n\r\nThroughout the whole period of the war all the several demands of\r\nthe Government upon the organised workers, the abrogation of “Trade\r\nUnion Conditions” in all industries working for war needs, the first\r\nand second Munitions of War Acts, the subversion of individual liberty\r\nby the successive orders under the Defence of the Realm Acts, the\r\nsuccessive applications of the Military Service Acts, the imposition\r\nof what was practically Compulsory Arbitration to settle the rates\r\nof wages--were accepted, though only after serious protest, by large\r\nmajorities at the various Conferences of the Labour Party, as well as\r\nby the various annual Trades Union Congresses,[724] in spite of the\r\nresistance of minorities, including more than “pacifists.” The entry of\r\nMr. Henderson into Mr. Asquith’s first Coalition Government, and that\r\nof Mr. Barnes into Mr. Lloyd George’s War Cabinet, together with the\r\nacceptance of ministerial office by other leading members of the Labour\r\nParty--though any such ministerial coalition was in flagrant violation\r\nof the very principles of its existence, and was strenuously combated\r\non grounds of expediency by many of its members who loyally supported\r\nthe war--equally received the endorsement of large majorities at the\r\nParty Conferences. From the beginning of the war to the end, the Labour\r\nParty, alike in all its corporate acts and by the individual efforts of\r\nits leading members (other than the minority already mentioned), stuck\r\nat nothing in its determination to help the Government to win the war.\r\n\r\nMore controversial were the persistent efforts made by the Labour\r\nParty to maintain its international relations with the Labour and\r\nSocialist Movements of Continental Europe. From the first it was seen\r\nto be important to get the representatives of the Trade Unions and\r\nSocialist organisations of the Allied Nations, and not merely their\r\nGovernments, united in a declaration of the aims and the justification\r\nof a war that was everywhere outraging working-class idealism. Such a\r\nunanimity was successfully achieved in February 1915 at a conference,\r\nheld in London at the instance of the Labour Party, of delegates\r\nfrom the working-class organisations of France, Belgium, and Great\r\nBritain, with Russian representatives, then allied in arms against\r\nthe Central Empires.[725] Later on, when a Minority Party had been\r\nformed among the German Socialists, and when the Austrian and Hungarian\r\nworking-class Movements were also in revolt against the militarism of\r\ntheir Government, repeated efforts were made by the Labour Party to\r\nencourage this revolt, and for this purpose to obtain the necessary\r\nGovernment facilities for a meeting, in some neutral city, of the\r\nworking-class “International,” at which the Allied Case could be laid\r\nbefore the neutrals, and a basis found for united action with all\r\nthe working-class elements in opposition to the dominant military\r\nImperialism. After the Russian revolution of March 1917, the Petrograd\r\nWorkmen’s and Soldiers’ Council actually issued an invitation for a\r\nworking-class “International” at Stockholm; and the participation\r\nof the British Labour Party in this International Congress, which\r\nwas not then favoured by Mr. Henderson, received at one time no\r\nsmall support from the Prime Minister, Mr. Lloyd George. In the end\r\nthe Government despatched Mr. Henderson on an official mission to\r\nPetrograd (incidentally empowering him, if he thought fit, to remain\r\nthere as Ambassador at £8000 a year). Meanwhile the proposal for an\r\nInternational Congress had been modified, first into one for a purely\r\nconsultative gathering, and then into one for a series of separate\r\ninterviews between a committee of neutrals and the representatives of\r\neach of the belligerents in turn, with a view to discovering a possible\r\nbasis for peace--a project to which Mr. Henderson, from what he learnt\r\nat Petrograd, was converted. A National Conference of the Labour\r\nParty in August 1917 approved of participation in such a Congress at\r\nStockholm; but the French and Italian Governments would not hear of\r\nit, and Mr. Lloyd George went back on his prior approval, absolutely\r\ndeclining to allow passports to be issued. Amid great excitement, and\r\nunder circumstances of insult and indignity which created resentment\r\namong the British working class, Mr. Henderson felt obliged to tender\r\nhis resignation of his place in the War Cabinet, in which he was\r\nsucceeded by Mr. Barnes, who was getting more and more out of sympathy\r\nwith the majority of the Party.[726] The Labour Party Executive, in\r\nalliance with the Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress,\r\nthen applied itself to getting agreement among the Labour and Socialist\r\nMovements of the Allied Nations as to the lines on which--assuming\r\nan Allied victory--the terms of peace should be drawn, in order to\r\navert as much as possible of the widespread misery which, it could be\r\nforeseen, must necessarily fall upon the wage-earning class. In this\r\neffort, in which Mr. Henderson displayed great tact and patience, he\r\nhad the implicit sanction of the British Government, and, with some\r\nreluctance, also of the Governments of the other Allied Nations by whom\r\nthe necessary passports were issued for an Inter-Allied Conference in\r\nLondon in August 1917, which was abortive; for provisional discussions\r\nat Paris in February 1918; and for a second Inter-Allied Conference\r\nat the end of the same month in London, which resulted in a virtually\r\nunanimous agreement upon what should be the terms of peace,[727] on a\r\nbasis already approved on December 28, 1917, by a Joint Conference of\r\nthe Trades Union Congress and the Labour Party, and widely published\r\nall over the world. The terms thus agreed were, in fact, immediately\r\nadopted in outline in a public deliverance by Mr. Lloyd George as those\r\non which Germany could have peace at any time; and the same proposals\r\nwere promptly made the basis of President Wilson’s celebrated “Fourteen\r\nPoints” on which eventually (but only after another ten months’ costly\r\nwar) the Armistice of November 11, 1918, was concluded. Profound was\r\nthe disappointment, and bitter the resentment, of the greater part of\r\nthe organised Labour Movement of Great Britain when it was revealed how\r\nseriously the diplomatists at the Paris Conference had departed from\r\nthese terms in the Treaty of Peace which was imposed on the Central\r\nEmpires.[728]\r\n\r\nWe have already attempted to sum up the effect of the Great War on\r\nthe industrial status of Trade Unionism. It is more difficult to\r\nestimate its effect on the political organisation of the movement. The\r\noutbreak of the war had found the Labour Party, in the see-saw of Trade\r\nUnion opinion to which we have elsewhere referred, suffering from an\r\ninevitable disillusionment among Trade Unionists as to the immediate\r\npotency of Parliamentary representation--a disillusionment manifested\r\nin the outbreak of rebellious strikes that characterised the years\r\n1911-14. The achievements of the Labour Party in the House of Commons\r\nhad fallen short of the eager hopes with which the new party had raised\r\nits standard on its triumphant entry in 1906. In 1914, it may be said,\r\nthe Labour Party was at a dead point. The effect upon it of the Great\r\nWar was to raise it in proportion to the height of the vastly greater\r\nissues with which it was compelled to deal. Amid the stress of war,\r\nand of the intensely controversial decisions which it had necessarily\r\nto take, the Labour Party revised its constitution, widened its aims,\r\nopened its ranks to the “workers by brain” as well as the workers by\r\nhand, and received the accession of many thousands of converts from\r\nthe Liberal and Conservative Parties. It made great progress in its\r\ndifficult task of superimposing, on an organisation based on national\r\nsocieties, the necessary complementary organisation of its affiliated\r\nmembership by geographical constituencies. It equipped itself during\r\nthe war, for the first time, with a far-reaching and well-considered\r\nprogramme not confined to distinctively “Labour” issues, but covering\r\nthe whole field of home politics, and even extending to foreign\r\nrelations.[729] The formulation of such a programme, from beginning to\r\nend essentially Socialist in character, and including alike ideals of\r\nsocial reconstruction and detailed reforms of immediate practicability,\r\ntogether with the wholehearted adoption of this programme, after six\r\nmonths’ consideration by the constituent societies and branches, was\r\na notable achievement, which placed the British Labour Party ahead of\r\nthose of other countries. Moreover, the formulation of a comprehensive\r\nsocial programme and of “terms of Peace,” based on the principles\r\nfor which the war had ostensibly been fought--principles which were\r\ncertainly not carried in the Treaty of Peace--transformed the Labour\r\nParty from a group representing merely the class interests of the\r\nmanual workers into a fully constituted political Party of national\r\nscope, ready to take over the government of the country and to conduct\r\nboth home and foreign affairs on definite principles. Taken together\r\nwith the intellectual bankruptcy of the Liberal Party and its apparent\r\nincapacity to formulate any positive policy, whether with regard to\r\nthe redistribution of wealth within our own community or with regard\r\nto our attitude towards other races within or without the British\r\nEmpire, the emergence of the Labour Party programme meant that the\r\nParty stood forth, in public opinion, as the inevitable alternative to\r\nthe present Coalition Government when the time came for this to fall.\r\nThe result was that, aided by the steady growth of Trade Unionism,\r\nthe Party came near, between 1914 and 1919, to doubling its aggregate\r\nmembership. When hostilities ceased, it insisted on resuming the\r\ncomplete independence of the other political parties, which it had, by\r\njoining the successive Coalition Governments, consented temporarily to\r\nforgo; and such of its leaders as refused to withdraw from ministerial\r\noffice[730] were unhesitatingly shed from the Party. Meanwhile, the\r\nextension of the franchise and redistribution of seats, which had\r\nbeen carried by general consent in the spring of 1918, turned out to\r\nraise the electorate to nearly treble that of 1910, whilst the new\r\nconstituencies proved to have been so adjusted as greatly to facilitate\r\nan increase in the number of miners’ representatives. When the General\r\nElection came, in December 1918, though the Labour Party fought under\r\ngreat disadvantages and it was seen that most of the soldier electors\r\nwould be unable to record their votes, it put no fewer than 361 Labour\r\ncandidates in the field against Liberal and Conservative alike,\r\ncontesting two-thirds of all the constituencies in Great Britain. In\r\nface of a “Lloyd George tide” of unprecedented strength these Labour\r\ncandidates received nearly one-fourth of all the votes polled in\r\nthe United Kingdom; and though five-sixths of these numerous Labour\r\ncandidatures were unsuccessful (including, unfortunately, most of its\r\nablest Parliamentarians such as Messrs. Henderson,[731] MacDonald,\r\nAnderson, and Snowden), the Party increased its numerical strength in\r\nthe House of Commons by 50 per cent, and, to the universal surprise,\r\nreturned more than twice as many members as did the remnant of the\r\nLiberal Party adhering to Mr. Asquith--becoming, in fact, entitled to\r\nthe position of “His Majesty’s Opposition.” It can hardly be said that\r\nduring the session of 1919 the Parliamentary Labour Party, considerably\r\nstrengthened in numbers but weakened by the defeat of its ablest\r\nParliamentarians, has, under the leadership of the Right Honourable\r\nW. Adamson (Scottish Miners), made as much of its opportunities as\r\nthe Labour Party in the country expected and desired. The political\r\norganisation of the Trade Union world remains, indeed, very far from\r\nadequate to the achievement of its far-reaching aims. It is not merely\r\nthat the average British Trade Unionist, unlike the German, the Danish,\r\nSwedish, or the Belgian, has learnt so little the duty of subordinating\r\nminor personal or local issues, and of voting with his Party with\r\nas much loyalty as he shows in striking with his fellow-unionists,\r\nthat by no means all the aggregate British Trade Union membership\r\ncan steadfastly be relied on to vote for the Labour candidates. Nor\r\nis it only that the British Labour Party still fails to command the\r\naffiliation of as many Trade Unions as the Trades Union Congress, and\r\nthat the great majority of the smaller and the local societies--less\r\nfrom dissent than out of apathy--remain aloof from both sides of\r\nthe national organisation. The Trades Union Congress itself, after\r\nengendering, as independent organisations, first the General Federation\r\nof Trade Unions, and then the Labour Party, has not yet resigned itself\r\nto limiting its activities. The General Federation of Trade Unions may\r\nbe said, indeed, to have now disappeared from the Trade Union world\r\nas an effective force in the determination of industrial or political\r\npolicy. There remain three separate organisations of national scope;\r\nthe Parliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress which it\r\nis now proposed to transform into a General Council, the Executive\r\nCommittee of the Labour Party, and the members of the House of Commons\r\nwho form the Parliamentary Labour Party. Unfortunately, between these\r\nthree groups there has been some lack of mutual consultation, and an\r\nindefiniteness if not a confusion of policy which stands in the way\r\nof effective leadership.[732] This has prevented the bringing to bear\r\nupon the political field of the full force, now almost a moiety of the\r\nwhole registered electorate of Great Britain, that the Trade Union\r\nworld may (including the wives of Trade Unionist electors) fairly\r\nclaim to include. Fundamentally, however, the shortcomings of the\r\npolitical organisation of the Trade Union world are to be ascribed\r\nto its failure, down to the present, to develop a staff of trained\r\npolitical officers at all equal to those of the Trade Union organisers\r\nand Trade Union negotiators in the industrial field. The Labour Party,\r\nwhich can as yet rely only on the quite inadequate contribution from\r\nits affiliated societies of no more than twopence per member annually,\r\nhas, so far, not succeeded in obtaining and keeping the services,\r\nas Registration Officers and Election Agents, of anything like so\r\nextensive and so competent a staff as either of the other political\r\nparties; and Labour Party candidatures are still run, occasionally with\r\nastonishing success, very largely upon that transient enthusiasm of\r\nthe crowd upon which experienced electioneers wisely decline to rely\r\nfor victory. What is, however, much more crippling to the Labour Party\r\nthan the scanty funds with which its constituent societies supply it,\r\nand this insufficiency in the staff of trained election organisers, is\r\nthe scarcity of trained Parliamentary representatives. Down to to-day\r\nthe great bulk of Labour Members of Parliament have been drawn from\r\nthe ranks of the salaried secretaries and other industrial officers\r\nof Trade Unions, who are nearly always not only men of competence in\r\ntheir own spheres, but also exceptionally good speakers for popular\r\naudiences, and, generally, in many respects above the average of\r\nmiddle-class candidates. But as Members of Parliament they have serious\r\nshortcomings. They can, to begin with, seldom devote the necessary\r\ntime to their new duties. They usually find themselves compelled to\r\nstrive to combine attendance at the House of Commons with the onerous\r\nindustrial service of their societies. The Trade Unions have, as yet,\r\nonly in a few cases realised the necessity of setting free from the\r\nconstant burden of Trade Union work--as they might by promotion to\r\nsome such consultative office as that of a salaried President--such\r\nof their officials as secure election to Parliament; whilst these\r\nofficers, unable to maintain themselves and their families in London\r\non their Parliamentary allowance for expenses of £400 a year, and\r\nafraid lest the loss of their seats may presently leave them without\r\nincomes, dare not resign their Trade Union posts. The result is an\r\nimperfect and always uncertain attendance of the Labour Members at the\r\nHouse of Commons; a fatal division and diversion of their attention;\r\nand an inevitable failure on their part to discharge with the fullest\r\nefficiency the duties of their two offices. Equally destructive of\r\nParliamentary efficiency is the omission of the Trade Union world to\r\nprovide or secure any training in the duties of a Member of Parliament\r\nfor those whom they select as candidates and whose election expenses\r\nthey defray with unstinted liberality. The lifelong training which\r\nthese candidates have enjoyed as Branch and District Secretaries, as\r\nindustrial organisers and negotiators, and as administrators of great\r\nTrade Unions, valuable as it is for Trade Union purposes, does not\r\ninclude, and indeed tends rather to exclude, the practical training\r\nin general politics, the working acquaintance with the British\r\nConstitution, the knowledge of how to use and how to control the adroit\r\nand well-equipped Civil Service, and the ability to translate both the\r\nhalf-articulate desires of the electorate to the House of Commons,\r\nand the advice of the political expert to the electorate, which,\r\ncoupled with the general art of “Parliamentarianism,” constitutes the\r\nequipment of the really efficient Member of the House of Commons. Add\r\nto this that the very training which the life of the successful Trade\r\nUnion official has given him, his perpetual struggle to rise in his\r\nvocation in competitive rivalry, not with persons of opposite views but\r\nactually with personal acquaintances of the same craft and the same\r\npolitical opinions as himself, is, in itself, not a good preparation\r\nfor the incessant mutual consultation and carefully planned “team-work”\r\nwhich contributes so much to the effectiveness of a minority party\r\nin the House of Commons. Add to this again the personal rivalries\r\namong members of the Party, the jealousies from which no party is\r\nfree, and the almost complete lack of opportunity for the constant\r\nsocial intercourse with each other away from the House of Commons that\r\nthe members of the other parties enjoy--and it will be realised how\r\nseriously the Parliamentary Labour Party is handicapped by being made\r\nup, as it is at present, almost entirely of men who are compelled also\r\nto serve as Trade Union officials. Already, however, there are signs of\r\nimprovement. Some Trade Unions, whilst willing to spend large sums on\r\nParliamentary candidatures, are demurring to their salaried officials\r\ngoing to Westminster. The Workers’ Educational Association, Ruskin\r\nCollege, and other educational agencies are doing much to provide a\r\nwider political training than Trade Unionists have heretofore enjoyed.\r\nAnd as the Parliamentary Labour Party, claiming to-day to represent,\r\nnot the Trade Unionists only, but the whole community of “workers\r\nby hand or by brain,” expands from sixty to four or six times that\r\nnumber--as it must before it can be confronted with the task of forming\r\na Government--it will necessarily come to include an ever-increasing\r\nproportion of members drawn from other than Trade Union ranks; whilst\r\neven its Trade Union members cannot fail to acquire more of that habit\r\nof mutual intercourse and that art of combined action which, coupled\r\nwith the Parliamentary skill and capacity for public administration\r\nof those who rise to leadership, is the necessary basis of successful\r\nparty achievement.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the political organisation of the Trade Union Movement, and\r\nthe enlargement of its ideas on Communal and Industrial Democracy,\r\nhave been manifesting themselves also in the important sphere of Local\r\nGovernment. After the “Labour” successes at the elections of Local\r\nAuthorities, which continued for a whole decade from 1892, and placed\r\nover a thousand Trade Unionists and Socialists on Parish, District,\r\nBorough and County Councils, there ensued another decade in which,\r\nin the majority of districts, this active participation in local\r\nelections was impaired by the diversion of interest, both to Parliament\r\nand to industrial organisation. From 1914 to 1919 local elections\r\nwere suspended. On their resumption in the latter year, they were\r\nenergetically contested by the Labour Party, all over Great Britain, on\r\nits new and definitely Socialist programme, with the unexpected result\r\nthat, up and down the country, the Labour candidates frequently swept\r\nthe board, polling in the aggregate a very substantial proportion of\r\nthe votes, electing altogether several thousand Councillors (five or\r\nsix hundred in Scotland alone), and being returned in actual majorities\r\nin nearly half the Metropolitan Boroughs, several important Counties\r\nand Municipalities, and many Urban Districts and Parishes.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nIt must be apparent that any history of Trade Unionism that breaks off\r\nat the beginning of 1920 halts, not at the end of an epoch, but--we may\r\nalmost say--at the opening of a new chapter. British Trade Unionism, at\r\na moment when it is, both industrially and politically, stronger than\r\never before, is seething with new ideas and far-reaching aspirations.\r\nAt the same time, its most recent advances in status and power are\r\nby no means yet accepted by what remains the governing class; its\r\npolitical and industrial position is still precarious, and within a\r\nvery brief space it may again find itself fighting against a frontal\r\nattack upon its very existence. And in face of the common enemy--now\r\nunited as an autocratic capitalism--Industrial Democracy is uncertain\r\nof itself, and almost blindly groping after a precise adjustment of\r\npowers and functions between Associations of Producers and Associations\r\nof Consumers.\r\n\r\nLet us elaborate these points in detail. One result of the Great War\r\nhas been, if not the actual enthronement of Democracy, a tremendous\r\nshifting of authority to the mass of the people. Of this shifting of\r\nthe basis of power the advance in the status of Trade Unionism and the\r\nadvent, in British politics, of the Labour Party, are but preliminary\r\nmanifestations. As yet the mass of the people, to whom power is\r\npassing, have made but little effective use of their opportunities. At\r\nleast seven-eighths of the nation’s accumulated wealth, and with it\r\nnearly all the effective authority, is still in the hands of one-eighth\r\nof the population; and the seven-eighths of the people find themselves\r\nin consequence still restricted, as regards the means of life, to less\r\nthan half of that national income which is exclusively the product of\r\nthose who labour, by hand or by brain. The “leisure class”--the men\r\nand women who live by owning and not by working, a class increasing in\r\nactual numbers, if not relatively to the workers--seem to the great\r\nmass of working people to be showing themselves, if possible, more\r\nfrivolous and more insolent in their irresponsible consumption, by\r\nthemselves and their families, of the relatively enormous share that\r\nthey are able to take from the national income. It is coming to be\r\nmore and more felt that the continued existence of this class involves\r\na quite unwarranted burden upon their fellow-citizens working by\r\nhand or by brain. Very naturally there is widespread discontent, and\r\nthe emergence of all sorts of exasperated criticisms and extravagant\r\nschemes.\r\n\r\nThe truth is, of course, that Democracy, whether political or\r\nindustrial, is still in its infancy. The common run of men and women,\r\nwho have only just been enfranchised politically, and are even yet only\r\npartially organised industrially, are as yet unable to make full use\r\nof Democratic institutions. The majority of them cannot be induced,\r\nin the economic pressure to which Capitalism subjects them, to take\r\nthe trouble or give the continuous thought involved in any effective\r\nparticipation in public affairs. The result is that such Democratic\r\ninstitutions as we possess are, of necessity, still inefficiently\r\nmanaged; and neither the citizen-consumers nor the Trade Unionist\r\nproducers find themselves exercising much effective control over their\r\nown lives. The active-minded minority sees itself submerged by the\r\n“apathetic mass”; the individual feels enslaved by the “machine.” The\r\ncomplaint of the “rank and file”--using that term to mean, not any\r\n“extremist” minority, but merely the majority, the “common run of\r\nmen”--comes to no more than that they do not find themselves obtaining\r\nthe results in their daily lives which they expected, and which they\r\nwere, as they understood, promised. This, we think, is the explanation\r\nof the perpetual “see-saw” within the Labour Movement, decade after\r\ndecade, between an infatuation for industrial or “direct” action and\r\nan equal infatuation for political or Parliamentary and Municipal\r\naction--each, unfortunately, to the temporary neglect of the other. Or\r\nto state the Democratic problem in a more fundamental form, the see-saw\r\nis between the aspiration to vest the control over the instruments of\r\nproduction in Democracies of Producers, and the alternating belief\r\nthat this control can best be vested in Democracies of Consumers. But\r\nit is abundantly clear, alike from history and economic analysis, that\r\nin any genuine Democracy both forms of organisation are indispensably\r\nrequired. In the modern State every person throughout his whole life\r\nconsumes a great variety of commodities and services which he cannot\r\nproduce; whilst men and women, occupied in production, habitually\r\nproduce a single commodity or service for other persons to consume.\r\nTheir interests and desires as producers, and as producers of a single\r\ncommodity or service, are not, and can never be, identical with the\r\ninterests and desires of these same people as consumers of many\r\ndifferent commodities and services--just as their interests and desires\r\nas citizens of a community, or as members of a race which they wish to\r\ncontinue in independent existence, are not necessarily identical with\r\nthose of which they are conscious either as producers or as consumers.\r\n\r\nIt is, in fact, now realised that Democratic organisation involves\r\nthe acceptance, not of a single basis--that of the undifferentiated\r\nhuman being--but of various separate and distinct bases: man as a\r\nproducer; man as a consumer; man as a citizen concerned with the\r\ncontinued existence and independence of his race or community; possibly\r\nalso other bases, such as man as a scientist or man as a religious\r\nbeliever. What is wrong in each successive generation is the intolerant\r\nfanaticism of the enthusiasts which leads them to insist on any\r\none form of this multiplex Democracy to the exclusion of the other\r\nforms. We see to-day uppermost a revival of faith in Associations of\r\nProducers, as being, in an industrial community, the form of Democratic\r\norganisation most important to the working people. To some one-sided\r\nminds, as was inevitable, the all-embracing Association of Producers\r\nseems the only form that Democratic organisation can validly take.\r\nInteresting to the historian is the intellectual connection of this\r\nrevival with the previous manifestations, in the Trade Union Movement,\r\nof the idea of “Co-operative Production,” whether in the revolutionary\r\nOwenism of 1830-34, the Christian Socialism of 1848-52, or the\r\nexperiments of particular Unions in 1872. As we have explained, the\r\nTrade Union, being essentially an Association of Producers, has never\r\nquite lost the idea that, so far as industry is concerned, this form\r\nof association, and no other, is Democracy. But the new form in which\r\nthe faith in Associations of Producers is now expressing itself is\r\nconcerned less with the ownership of the instruments of production (it\r\nbeing to-day commonly taken for granted that this must be vested in the\r\ncommunity as a whole) than with the management of industry. According\r\nto the most thoroughgoing advocates of this creed, the management of\r\neach industry should be placed, not separately in the hands of those\r\nengaged in each establishment, any more than in the hands of private\r\ncapitalist employers, but in the hands of the whole body of persons\r\nthroughout the community who are actually co-operating in the work\r\nof the industry, whether by hand or by brain; this management being\r\nshared, by Workshop or Pit Committees, District Councils and National\r\nBoards, among all these “workers.”\r\n\r\nThis conception seems to us too one-sided to be adopted in its\r\nentirety, or to be successful if it were so adopted. We venture to\r\ngive, necessarily in a cursory and generalised form, the results\r\nof our own investigations into the management of industries and\r\nservices by Democracies of Producers and Democracies of Consumers\r\nrespectively. In so far as we may draw any valid inferences from\r\nprevious experiments of different kinds, we must note that the record\r\nof the successive attempts, in modern industry, to place the entire\r\nmanagement of industrial undertakings in the hands of Associations\r\nof Producers has been one of failure. In marked contrast, the\r\nopposite form of Democracy, in which the management has been placed\r\nin the hands of Associations of Consumers, has achieved a large and\r\nconstantly increasing measure of success. We do not refer merely to the\r\never-growing development throughout the civilised world, in certain\r\nextensive fields of industrial operation, of Municipal and National\r\nGovernment, though from this some valuable lessons may be learnt.\r\nEven more instructive is the continuous and ever-widening success, in\r\nthe importing, manufacturing, and distributing of household supplies,\r\nof the voluntary Associations of Consumers known as the Co-operative\r\nMovement, which is almost entirely made up of the same class of men and\r\nwomen--often, indeed, of the very same individuals--as we find in the\r\nabortive “self-governing workshops” and in the Trade Union Movement.\r\nWhy, for instance, is it possible for the manual workers, organised as\r\nconsumers, to carry on successfully the most extensive establishments\r\nfor the milling of flour, the baking of bread, the making of boots and\r\nshoes, and the weaving of cloth, when repeated attempts to conduct such\r\nestablishments by the same kind of members organised as Associations of\r\nProducers have not succeeded?[733]\r\n\r\nThe Democracy of Associations of Consumers, whatever its shortcomings\r\nand defects, has, we suggest, the great advantage of being demonstrably\r\npracticable. The job can be done. It has also the further merit that\r\nit solves the problem presented by what the economists call the Law\r\nof Rent. It does not leave to any individual or group of individuals\r\nthe appropriation and enjoyment of those advantages of superior sites\r\nand soils, and other differential factors in production, which should\r\nbe, economically and ethically, taken only by the community as a\r\nwhole. Moreover, management by Associations of Consumers, whether\r\nNational, Municipal, or Co-operative, gives one practical solution to\r\nthe problem of fixing prices without competition, by enabling every\r\nproducer to be paid at his own full Standard Rate, and distributing\r\nthe various products at prices just over cost, the whole eventual\r\nsurplus being returned to the purchasers in a rebate or discount\r\non purchases, called “dividend”; or otherwise appropriated for the\r\nbenefit and by direction of the consumers themselves. Hence there is\r\nno danger of private monopoly; no opportunity for particular groups of\r\nproducers to make corners in raw materials; to get monopoly prices for\r\ncommodities in times of scarcity, or to resist legitimate improvements\r\nin machinery or processes merely because these would interfere with\r\nthe vested interests of the persons owning particular instruments\r\nof production or possessing a particular kind of skill. In short,\r\nthe control of industries and services by Democracies of Consumers\r\nrealises the Socialist principle of production for use and not for\r\nexchange, with all its manifold advantages. The most significant\r\nof these superiorities of Production for Use over Production for\r\nExchange is its inevitable effect on the structure and working of\r\nDemocracy. Seeing that the larger the output the smaller the burden\r\nof overhead charges--or, to put it in another way, the greater the\r\nmembership the more advantageous the enterprise--Associations of\r\nConsumers are not tempted to close their ranks. This kind of Democracy\r\nautomatically remains always open to new-comers. On the other hand,\r\nAssociations of Producers, whether capitalists, technicians or manual\r\nworkers, exactly because they turn out commodities and services not\r\nfor their own use, but for exchange, are perpetually impelled to\r\nlimit their numbers, so as to get, for the existing membership, the\r\nhighest possible remuneration. This kind of Democracy is, therefore,\r\ninstinctively exclusive, tending always to become, within the\r\ncommunity, a privileged body. All this amounts to a solid reason in\r\nfavour of “nationalisation,” “municipalisation,” and the consumers’\r\nCo-operative Movement, which is reflected in the continuous and\r\nactually accelerating extension of all of them, not in one country\r\nonly, but throughout the civilised world.[734]\r\n\r\nBut the Democracy based on Associations of Consumers, whether in the\r\nNational Government, the Municipality, or the Co-operative Society,\r\nreveals certain shortcomings and defects, some transient and resulting\r\nonly from the existing Capitalism, and others needing the remedy of\r\na complementary Democracy of Producers. So long as we have a society\r\ncharacterised by gross inequalities of income, it is inevitable that\r\nthe conduct of industries and services by Associations of Consumers\r\nshould be even more advantageous to the rich than to the poor, and\r\nof little or no use to those who are destitute. The same trail of a\r\nCapitalist environment affects also the conditions of employment. The\r\nCo-operative Society, the Municipality or the Government Department\r\ncannot practically depart far from the normal conditions of the rest\r\nof the community; and thus avails little to raise the condition of\r\nthe manual working class. If, however, the Associations of Consumers\r\nwere co-extensive with the community, they would themselves fix the\r\nstandard. But there is a more fundamental criticism. The Democracy\r\nof Consumers, in Co-operative Society, Municipality or State--however\r\nwide may be the franchise, however effective may be the Parliamentary\r\nmachinery, and however much the elected executive is brought under\r\nconstituency control--has the outstanding defect to the manual-working\r\nproducer that, so far as his own working life is concerned, he does\r\nnot feel it to be Democracy at all! The management, it is complained,\r\nis always “government from above.” It is exactly for this reason\r\nthat in the evolution of British Democracy the conduct of industries\r\nand services by Associations of Consumers--whether in the voluntary\r\nCo-operative Society or in the geographically organised Municipality\r\nor State--has had, for a correlative, the organisation of Associations\r\nof Producers, whether Professional Societies or Trade Unions. Their\r\nfirst object was merely to maintain and improve their members’ Standard\r\nof Life. Without the enforcement of a Standard Rate and protection\r\nagainst personal tyranny, government by Associations of Consumers is\r\napt to develop many of the evils of the “sweating” characteristic of\r\nunrestrained capitalism. It is not now denied, even by the economists,\r\nthat Trade Unionism, in its establishment of the Doctrine of the Common\r\nRule, and the elaboration of this into the Standard Rate, the Normal\r\nDay, and the Policy of the National Minimum, has to its credit during\r\nthe past three-quarters of a century no small measure of success, with\r\nmore triumphs easily within view. Trade Unionism among the manual\r\nworkers, like Professional Association among the brain-workers,[735]\r\nhas emphatically justified itself by its achievements.\r\n\r\nBut Trade Unionism, though it has gone far to protect the worker from\r\ntyranny, has not, as yet, gained for him any positive participation in\r\nindustrial management. To this extent the complaints of the objectors\r\namong the manual-working class are justified. In the perpetual see-saw\r\nof opinion in the Labour world the movement towards Parliamentary\r\naction and in favour of what we may call Communal Socialism became,\r\nat one time, almost an infatuation, in that its most enthusiastic\r\nadvocates thought that it would, by itself, solve all problems. A\r\nreaction was inevitable. The danger is that this reaction may itself\r\ntake on the character of an infatuation--this time in favour of the\r\nuniversal domination of Associations of Producers, and the “Direct\r\nAction” to which they are prone--against which, in the perpetual\r\nsee-saw, there will come, in its turn, a contrary reaction, in the\r\ncourse of which Trade Unionism itself may suffer.\r\n\r\nThis is not to say that the legitimate and desirable movement,\r\nspecially characteristic of the present century, for increased direct\r\nparticipation in “management” of the Associations of Producers--whether\r\nof Professional Societies or of Trade Unions, of doctors and teachers,\r\nor of miners and railwaymen--has been, in this or any other country,\r\nanything like exhausted. In our view, in fact, it is along these lines\r\nthat the next developments are to be expected. But, unless we are\r\nmistaken in our analysis, this does not mean that the Trade Unions or\r\nProfessional Societies will take over the entire management of their\r\nindustries or services, for which, in our opinion, no Association\r\nof Producers can be fitted.[736] Democracies of Producers, like\r\nDemocracies of Consumers, have their peculiar defects, and develop\r\ncertain characteristic toxins from the very intensity of the interests\r\nthat they represent. The chief of these defects is the corporate\r\nexclusiveness and corporate selfishness habitually developed by\r\nassociations based on the common interest of a particular section of\r\nworkers, as against other sections of workers on the one hand, and\r\nagainst the whole body of consumers and citizens on the other. When\r\nDemocracies of Producers own the instruments of production, or even\r\nsecure a monopoly of the service to be rendered, they have always\r\ntended in the past to close their ranks, to stereotype their processes\r\nand faculties, to exclude outsiders and to ban heterodoxy. We see\r\nthis tendency at work alike in the ancient and modern world, in the\r\ncastes of India and the Gilds of China, in the mediæval Craft Gilds as\r\nwell as in the modern Trade Unions and Professional Associations. So\r\nlong as the Trade Union is an organ of revolt against the Capitalist\r\nSystem--so long as the manual workers are fighting a common enemy in\r\nthe private owner of land and capital--this corporate selfishness is\r\nheld in check; though the frequency of demarcation disputes, even in\r\nthe Trade Union Movement of to-day, gives some indication of what might\r\nhappen if the Trade Union became an organ of government. We see no\r\nway of securing the community of consumers and citizens against this\r\nspirit of corporate exclusiveness, and against the inherent objection\r\nof an existing generation of producers to new methods of working\r\nunfamiliar to them, otherwise than placing the supreme control in the\r\nDemocracies of Consumers and citizens. There is a further and more\r\nsubtle defect in Democracies of Producers, the very mention of which\r\nmay perhaps be resented by those Industrial Unionists who seek to curb\r\nthe “corporateness” of National Gilds by the “self-government” of the\r\nworkshop. The experience of self-governing workshops shows that the\r\nrelationship between the indispensable director or manager (who must,\r\nlike the conductor of an orchestra, decide the tune and set the time)\r\nand the workers whom he directs becomes hopelessly untenable if this\r\ndirector or manager is elected or dismissible by the very persons to\r\nwhom he gives orders. Over and over again, in the records of the almost\r\ninnumerable self-governing workshops that have been established in\r\nGreat Britain or on the Continent, we find their failure intimately\r\nconnected with the impracticable position of a manager directing the\r\nworkers during the day, and being reprimanded or altogether superseded\r\nby a committee meeting of these same workers in the evening! Finally,\r\nthere is the difficult question of the price to be put on the article\r\nwhen it passes to the consumer. Normally the price of a commodity must\r\ncover the cost of production, and this cost is, in the main, determined\r\nby the character of the machinery and process employed. Hence, if the\r\norganised workers are given the power to decide not only the number and\r\nqualifications of the persons to be employed but also the machinery\r\nand process to be used, they will, in fact, determine the price to be\r\ncharged to the consumer--not always to the consumer’s advantage, or\r\nconsistently with the interests of other sections of workers.[737]\r\n\r\nTo sum up, we expect to see the supreme authority in each industry\r\nor service vested, not in the workers as such, but in the community\r\nas a whole. Any National Board may well include representatives\r\nof the producers of the particular product or service, and also\r\nof its consumers, but they must be reinforced by the presence of\r\nrepresentatives of the community organised as citizens, interested\r\nin the future as well as the present prosperity of the community. The\r\nmanagement of industry, a complex function of many kinds and grades,\r\nwill, as we see it, not be the sole sphere of either the one or the\r\nother set of partners, but is clearly destined to be distributed\r\nbetween them--the actual direction and decision being shared between\r\nthe representatives of the Trade Union or Professional Society on\r\nthe one hand, and those of the community in Co-operative Society,\r\nMunicipality, or National Government on the other. And this recognition\r\nof the essential partnership in management between Associations of\r\nProducers and that Association of Consumers which is the community\r\nin one or other form, will, we suggest, take different shapes in\r\ndifferent industries and services, in different countries, and at\r\ndifferent periods; and, as we must add, will necessarily take time\r\nand thought to work out in detail. One thing is clear. There will\r\nbe a steadily increasing recognition of a fundamental change in the\r\nstatus both of the directors and managers of industry (who are now\r\nusually either themselves capitalists, or hired for the service of\r\ncapitalist interests), and of the technicians and manual workers. The\r\ndirectors and managers of industry, however they may be selected and\r\npaid, will become increasingly the officers of the community, serving\r\nnot their own but the whole community’s interests. The technicians and\r\nmanual workers will become ever less and less the personal servants\r\nof the directors and managers; and will be more and more enrolled,\r\nlike them, in the service, not of any private employer, but of the\r\ncommunity itself, whether the form be that of State or Municipality\r\nor Co-operative Society, or any combination or variant of these. To\r\nuse the expression of the present General Secretary of the Miners’\r\nFederation (Frank Hodges), manager, technician, and manual worker alike\r\nwill become parties to a “social” as distinguished from a commercial\r\ncontract. All alike, indeed, whatever may be the exact form of\r\nownership of the instruments of production, will, so far as function\r\nis concerned, become increasingly partners in the performance of a\r\ncommon public service.\r\n\r\nWe see in this evolution a great future for the Trade Unions, if they\r\nwill, in organisation and personal equipment, rise to the height of\r\ntheir enlarged function. They will need, by amalgamation or federation,\r\nand by affording facilities for easy admission and for a simple\r\ntransfer of membership, to make themselves much more nearly than at\r\npresent co-extensive with their several industries. They will have to\r\nmake special provision in their constitutions to secure an effective\r\nrepresentation, on their own executive and legislative councils, of\r\ndistinct crafts, grades, or specialisations, which must always form\r\nsmall minorities of the whole body. They will find it necessary to\r\nmake the local organisation of their members, in branch or district,\r\nmuch more coincident than at present with their members’ several\r\nplaces of employment, so as to approximate to making identical the\r\nworkshop and the branch. There would seem to be a great development\r\nopening up for the Works Committees and the “Shop Stewards,” brought\r\neffectively into organic relation with the nationally settled\r\nindustrial policy. At any rate, in industries already passing under\r\nthe control of Associations of Consumers, whether by nationalisation\r\nor municipalisation, or by the spread of consumers’ co-operation,\r\nthere will be great scope for District Councils and National Boards,\r\nas well as for Advisory and Research Committees representative of\r\ndifferent specialities, in which managers and foremen, technicians and\r\noperatives, will jointly supersede the capitalist Board of Directors.\r\nBut the management of each industry is very far from being the whole\r\nof the task. In Parliament itself, and on Municipal Councils, the\r\nWorld of Labour, by hand or by brain, will need to give a continuous\r\nand an equal backing to its own political party, in order to see to\r\nit that it has its own representatives--specialised and trained for\r\nthis supreme political function--not by ones and twos, but in force;\r\ngradually coming, in fact, to predominate over the representatives of\r\nthe surviving capitalist and landlord parties. Trade Unionists, in\r\nthe mass, will not only have to continue and extend the loyalty and\r\nself-devotion which have always been characteristic of successful Trade\r\nUnionism, but also to acquire a more comprehensive understanding of\r\nthe working of democratic institutions, a more accurate appreciation\r\nof the imperative necessity of combining both the leading types of\r\ndemocratic self-government--on the one hand the self-government based\r\non the common needs of the whole population divided into geographical\r\nconstituencies, and on the other the self-government springing from the\r\nspecial requirements of men and women bound together by the fellowship\r\nof a common task and a common technique. The Trade Unions and\r\nProfessional Societies, if they are increasingly to participate in the\r\ngovernment of their industries and services, will in particular have\r\nto provide themselves with a greater number of whole-time specialist\r\nrepresentatives, better paid and more considerately treated than at\r\npresent, and supplied with increased opportunities for education and\r\ntraining.\r\n\r\nWe end on a note of warning. The object and purpose of the workers,\r\norganised vocationally in Trade Unions and Professional Associations,\r\nand politically in the Labour Party, is no mere increase of wages\r\nor reduction of hours.[738] It comprises nothing less than a\r\nreconstruction of society, by the elimination, from the nation’s\r\nindustries and services, of the Capitalist Profitmaker, and the\r\nconsequent shrinking up of the class of functionless persons who live\r\nmerely by owning. Profit-making as a pursuit, with its sanctification\r\nof the motive of pecuniary self-interest, is the demon that has to\r\nbe exorcised. The journey of the Labour Party towards its goal must\r\nnecessarily be a long and arduous one. In the painful “Pilgrim’s\r\nProgress” of Democracy the workers will be perpetually tempted into\r\nby-paths that lead only to the Slough of Despond. It is not so much the\r\nenticing away of individuals in the open pursuit of wealth that is to\r\nbe feared, as the temptation of particular Trade Unions, or particular\r\nsections of the workers, to enter into alliances with Associations\r\nof Capitalist Employers for the exploitation of the consumer.\r\n“Co-partnership,” or profit-sharing with individual capitalists, has\r\nbeen seen through and rejected. But the “co-partnership” of Trade\r\nUnions with Associations of Capitalists--whether as a development\r\nof “Whitley Councils” or otherwise--which far-sighted capitalists\r\nwill presently offer in specious forms (with a view, particularly,\r\nto Protective Customs Tariffs and other devices for maintaining\r\nunnecessarily high prices, or to governmental favours and remissions\r\nof taxation) is, we fear, hankered after by some Trade Union leaders,\r\nand might be made seductive to particular grades or sections of\r\nworkers. Any such policy, however plausible, would in our judgement\r\nbe a disastrous undermining of the solidarity of the whole working\r\nclass, and a formidable obstacle to any genuine Democratic Control of\r\nIndustry, as well as to any general progress in personal freedom and in\r\nthe more equal sharing of the National Product.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[707] See his _Arbeitergilden der Gegenwart_, 1871-72; his more\r\ngeneralised survey, _Das Arbeitsverhältniss gemäss den heutigen Recht_\r\n(Leipsic, 1877), translated as _The Relation of Labour to the Law of\r\nTo-day_ (New York, 1890); and his article on “The Growth of a Trades\r\nUnion,” in the _North British Review_, October 1870.\r\n\r\n[708] Sec. 24 of the Factory Act of 1891 provides, as regards textile\r\nmanufactures, that the employer shall supply every worker by the\r\npiece with certain particulars as to the quantity of work and rate of\r\nremuneration for it.\r\n\r\n[709] _History of Trade Unionism_, by S. and B.

At the second Trades Union\r\nCongress, at Birmingham in 1869, a paper had been read on “Direct\r\nLabour Representation in Parliament,” but Congress took no action.\r\nA separate “Labour Representation League” was then formed under the\r\npresidency of R.

Lathom, a Chancery barrister, to which many leading\r\nTrade Unionists belonged, of which Henry Broadhurst was secretary\r\nfrom 1872 to about 1878, and which sought from the Liberal Party\r\nopportunities for the return of a few working-class members; but\r\n(as formerly in the cases of William Newton’s contest for the Tower\r\nHamlets in 1852 and George Odger’s at Southwark in 1870) in vain. At\r\nthe General Election of 1874, as we have already described, fourteen\r\nworkmen went to the poll; but in ten of the constituencies they were\r\nfought by both parties, and only in the other four did the Liberals\r\nallow them to be fought by Conservatives alone, with the result that\r\ntwo only (out of the latter four) were elected, namely, Alexander\r\nMacdonald and Thomas Burt. At the General Election in 1880, again with\r\nLiberal acquiescence, Henry Broadhurst was added to their number;\r\nand in 1885 this was raised to eleven (of whom six were miners). All\r\nthese, whilst pushing measures desired by the Trade Unions, acted\r\nhabitually with the Liberal Party. In 1886--the Labour Representation\r\nLeague having faded away about 1881--the Congress appointed a “Labour\r\nElectoral Committee” to do the same work; but this was never able to\r\nfree itself from subserviency to the Liberal Party, and it achieved no\r\nsuccess, dying away in 1893. Some personal reminiscences are given in\r\n“Labour Representation Thirty Years Ago,” by Henry Broadhurst, M.P., in\r\nthe _Fourth Annual Report of General Federation of Trade Unions_, 1903;\r\nsee also _History of Labour Representation_, by A. W. Humphrey, 1912.\r\n\r\n[712] In a “scribbling diary” of 1884 is the following entry:\r\n\r\n“Written by Jas. K. Hardie, born August 15, 1856, married August 3,\r\n1879, began work as a message boy in Glasgow when 8 years and 9 months\r\nold, wrought for some time also in a printing office in Trongate, in\r\nthe brass finishing shop of the Anchor Line Shipping Co., also as a\r\nrivet heater in Thompson’s heatyard. Left Glasgow in the year 1866 and\r\nwent into No. 18 pit of the Moss at Newarthill, from thence to Quarter\r\nIron Works, and again to one or two other collieries in neighbourhood\r\nof Hamilton. Was elected Secretary to Miners’ Association in 1878, and\r\nfor the same position in Ayrshire in 1879; resigned April, 1882, when\r\ngot appointment unsolicited as correspondent to _Cumnock News_. Brought\r\nup an atheist, converted to Christianity in 1878.”\r\n\r\nKeir Hardie, whose kindliness and integrity of character endeared\r\nhim to all who knew him, was from 1887 down to his death in 1915 the\r\napostle of “independency” in the political organisation of Labour. He\r\nsat in the Trades Union Congress from 1887 to 1895 as representative\r\nof the Ayrshire Miners; and in the House of Commons from 1892 to 1895\r\n(for West Ham), from 1906 to 1915 (for Merthyr). He was Chairman of the\r\n“I.L.P.” from 1893 to 1898, and again in 1914. Pending the publication\r\nof a biography by W. Stewart, reference may be made to a biographical\r\nSketch entitled _From Pit to Parliament_, by Frank Smith; a character\r\nsketch by F. Pethick Lawrence in the _Labour Record_ for August 1905;\r\nthe issues of the _Labour Leader_ for September 30 and October 7, 1915;\r\nand an article entitled “An Old Diary,” by F. J. in the _Socialist\r\nReview_, January 1919.\r\n\r\n[713] _Annual Report of Trades Union Congress_, 1887.\r\n\r\n[714] It is said that the Liberal Party agents attempted, in vain, to\r\nbribe him to withdraw; eventually offering as high a price as a safe\r\nLiberal seat on the first opportunity, all his election expenses, and\r\n£300 a year--if only he would wear the Liberal badge!\r\n\r\n[715] See, for instance, the following “Fabian Tracts,” which had a\r\nlarge circulation among Trade Unionists: No. 6 of 1887, “The True\r\nRadical Programme”; No. 11 of 1890, “The Workers’ Political Programme”;\r\nNo. 40 of 1892, “The Fabian Election Manifesto”; No. 49 of 1894, “A\r\nPlan of Campaign for Labour” (_History of the Fabian Society_, by E. R.\r\nPease, 1916).\r\n\r\n[716] These included John Burns (Amalgamated Society of Engineers),\r\nJ. Havelock Wilson (National Sailors’ and Firemen’s Union), Joseph\r\nArch (Agricultural Labourers’ Union), W. R. (afterwards Sir William)\r\nCremer (General Union of Carpenters), G. Howell (Operative Bricklayers’\r\nSociety), J. Rowlands (an ex-watchcase-maker), and eight coalminers.\r\n\r\n[717] By J. O’Grady (Furnishing Trades), afterwards M.P. for Leeds;\r\n_Annual Report of Trades Union Congress_, 1898.\r\n\r\n[718] This was adopted in preference to what was considered a\r\nmore extreme proposal (moved by P. Vogel of the Waiters’ Union,\r\na Socialist), appointing the Trades Union Congress itself the\r\norganisation for independent Labour representation in Parliament;\r\nrequiring every Union to contribute a halfpenny per member per annum,\r\nand making the Parliamentary Committee disburse the election expenses\r\nand the salaries of the members returned to the House of Commons\r\n(_Annual Report of Trades Union Congress_, 1899).\r\n\r\nIt was afterwards stated that the leaders of the Trades Union Congress\r\nhad had in contemplation the subordination of the Labour Representation\r\nCommittee to the Congress. But with a different constituency the new\r\nbody had necessarily to be an independent organisation; and in 1904\r\nthe General Purposes Committee reported to the Trades Union Congress,\r\nwhich endorsed the report, that any resolution to endorse or amend the\r\nconstitution of the Labour Representation Committee would not be in\r\norder at the Trades Union Congress (_ibid._, 1904).\r\n\r\n[719] D. J. (afterwards Sir David) Shackleton (Lancashire Weavers) was\r\nallowed a walk-over at Clitheroe in 1902; and in 1903 W. (afterwards\r\nthe Rt. Honourable W.) Crooks (Coopers) carried Woolwich after an\r\nexciting contest, and Arthur (afterwards the Rt. Honourable Arthur)\r\nHenderson (Friendly Society of Ironfounders) won Barnard Castle in a\r\nthree-cornered fight.\r\n\r\n[720] In some Unions outside influence, notably that of the railway\r\ncompanies, went to the expense of printing and distributing hundreds of\r\nthousands of forms by which dissentient members could claim exemption\r\nfrom the tiny “political” contribution; and in the Amalgamated Society\r\nof Railway Servants, in particular, thousands of such claims were made.\r\nThe number has now greatly diminished (1920).\r\n\r\n[721] _The Daily Citizen_ was started by a separate limited company,\r\nin which the control was permanently secured to representatives of\r\nthe Trade Unions and the Labour Party, on November 8, 1912. The\r\ntotal capital raised from the Trade Unions from first to last was\r\napproximately £200,000. This important journalistic venture, starting\r\nunder good auspices, met with untoward circumstances. It was crippled\r\nby a legal decision that Trade Unions had no power to subscribe to\r\nits cost, or even to make investments in its shares (an inference\r\nfrom the Osborne Judgement, which was reversed by the Trade Union Act\r\nof 1913, subject to compliance with the conditions as to political\r\nexpenditure). Before this set-back could be got over, the outbreak\r\nof war upset all financial calculations, and made the conduct of a\r\nnewspaper increasingly onerous. The paper stopped on June 5, 1915, and\r\nthe company was wound up, all creditors being paid in full, but the\r\nshareholders losing practically all that they had ventured. The failure\r\nwas a serious blow to the Labour Party, which has been badly in want\r\nof a daily newspaper--a lack supplied in 1919 by the energetic and\r\nadventurous _Daily Herald_, which, under the direction of Mr. George\r\nLansbury, has drawn to itself an unusual amount of talent, and now\r\nneeds only whole-hearted support from the Trade Unions.\r\n\r\n[722] It was, for instance, only the determined private resistance\r\nof the Trade Unionist leaders of the Labour Party that compelled the\r\nGovernment to abandon its project of introducing several hundred\r\nthousand Chinese labourers into Great Britain; a project which, if\r\ncarried out, not only might have been calamitous in its effect upon\r\nthe Standard of Life of the British workman--not to mention other evil\r\nconsequences--but would almost certainly have also led to a Labour\r\nrevolt against the continuance of the war. In this connection may be\r\nnoted the valuable work done throughout the war, not in the interests\r\nof Trade Unionism only, but in those of the wage-earning class, and\r\nof the community as a whole, by the War Emergency Workers’ National\r\nCommittee (J. S. Middleton, Honorary Secretary), a body which included\r\nrepresentatives not only of the Parliamentary Committee, Labour\r\nParty, and General Federation, but also of the Co-operative Union,\r\nthe National Union of Teachers, and other organisations. The valuable\r\nthough often unwelcome assistance which this Committee gave to the\r\nGovernment by insisting on the redress of grievances that officialdom\r\nwould have ignored, and by its working out of policy and persistence\r\nin agitation on such matters as pensions, limitation of prices,\r\nfood-rationing, rent restriction, and other subjects, on which its\r\npublications had marked results, deserve the attention of the historian.\r\n\r\n[723] Subsequently Mr. J. R. Clynes (National Union of General Workers)\r\nwas appointed Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Food; and on\r\nLord Rhondda’s death he succeeded him as Minister of Food.\r\n\r\n[724] See the printed reports of Labour Party Conferences and Trades\r\nUnion Congresses, 1914-19.\r\n\r\n[725] _Report of the Inter-Allied Socialist and Labour Conference_,\r\nFebruary 15, 1915.\r\n\r\n[726] Mr. Hodge succeeded to Mr. Barnes as Minister of Pensions, Mr.\r\nRoberts to Mr. Hodge as Minister of Labour, and Mr. G. J. Wardle\r\n(National Union of Railwaymen) to Mr. Roberts as Parliamentary\r\nSecretary of the Board of Trade.\r\n\r\n[727] _Memorandum on War Aims_ (Labour Party), February 1918.\r\n\r\n[728] It is difficult not to be struck with the greater breadth of\r\nvision, the higher idealism, and (as we venture to say) the larger\r\nstatesmanship of the Labour Party in its projects and proposals for\r\nthe resettlement of the world after the Great War, compared with\r\nthose which the statesmen and diplomatists of the capitalist parties\r\nof Great Britain, France, Italy, and, as we grieve to say, also the\r\nUnited States, with the acquiescence of deliberately inflamed popular\r\nelectorates, succeeded in embodying in the Treaty of Peace. Apart\r\nfrom the indefensible redistributions of political sovereignty, not\r\nessentially differing in spirit from those of the Congress of Vienna\r\nin 1814-15 (and probably less stable even than these), against which\r\nLabour opinion had strongly protested in advance, it is impossible\r\nnot to regret the failure to incorporate in the Treaty the proposals,\r\nfor which the Labour Party had secured the support of the organised\r\nworking-class opinion of the world, for (i.) the universal abandonment\r\nof discriminatory fiscal barriers to international trade; (ii.) the\r\nadministration of Colonial possessions exclusively in the interest of\r\nthe local inhabitants, and on the basis of equality of opportunity\r\nfor traders of all nations; (iii.) concerted international control\r\nof the exportable surplus of materials and food-stuffs of all the\r\nseveral countries, so as to mitigate, as far as possible, in the\r\ngeneral world-shortage which the Labour Party foresaw, the inevitable\r\nwidespread starvation in the most necessitous areas, whether enemy,\r\nallied, or neutral; (iv.) deliberate Government action in each country\r\nfor the prevention of unemployment, instead of letting it occur and\r\nthen merely relieving the unemployed. In questions of foreign policy\r\nthe Labour Party, inspired by its idealism, has shown itself at its\r\nbest, instead of this department of politics being, as is often\r\nignorantly assumed, altogether beyond its capacity.\r\n\r\n[729] The new constitution and enlarged programme which the Labour\r\nParty adopted at its Conferences of 1917-18, after six months’\r\nconsideration and discussion by the constituent organisations, were\r\nlittle more than a ratification for general adoption of what had\r\nbecome the practice of particular districts. Thus, the more active\r\nLocal Labour Parties, such as those of Woolwich and Blackburn, had\r\nlong welcomed the adhesion of supporters who were not manual workers.\r\nThe successive annual Conferences had passed resolutions which, taken\r\ntogether, amounted to a pretty complete programme of constructive\r\nlegislation, wholly Collectivist in principle. Hence the deliberate\r\nand formal opening of the Party, through the Local Labour Parties,\r\nto “workers by brain” as well as “workers by hand”; and the explicit\r\nadoption, as a programme, of _Labour and the New Social Order_ were not\r\nsuch innovations as the newspapers made out and as the public generally\r\nsupposed. But they created a sensation, not only in the United\r\nKingdom, but also in the United States and in the British Dominions;\r\nand they led to a considerable accession of membership, largely from\r\nthe professional and middle classes, which was steadily increased as\r\nthe unsatisfactory character of the Treaty of Peace, the continued\r\n“militarism” of the Government, and the aggression of a “Protectionist”\r\ncapitalism became manifest.\r\n\r\n[730] Messrs. Barnes, Roberts (who became Minister of Food), Parker,\r\nand Wardle.\r\n\r\n[731] Mr. Henderson was re-elected to Parliament in 1919 at a\r\nbye-election, capturing a strong Conservative seat at Widnes\r\n(Lancashire).\r\n\r\n[732] A “Joint Board”--from which the General Federation of Trade\r\nUnions was afterwards excluded--and, later on, joint meetings of the\r\nParliamentary Committee of the Trades Union Congress and the Executive\r\nCommittee of the Labour Party, did something to remove friction.\r\n\r\n[733] For the successive experiments in Co-operative Production by\r\nAssociations of Producers the student is referred to _The Co-operative\r\nMovement in Great Britain_, by Beatrice Potter (Mrs. Sidney Webb)\r\n(1891); _Co-operative Production_, by Benjamin Jones (1894); and, for a\r\nmore recent survey, the supplement to _The New Statesman_ of February\r\n14, 1914, entitled “Co-operative Production and Profit Sharing.”\r\n\r\n[734] See _Towards Social Democracy?_ by Sidney Webb (1916); and for\r\nrecent surveys, the supplements to _The New Statesman_ of May 30, 1914,\r\nand May 8, 1915, entitled, respectively, “The Co-operative Movement”\r\nand “State and Municipal Enterprise.”\r\n\r\n[735] For a recent survey of Professional Association in England and\r\nWales--the only general study of it known to us--see the supplements\r\nto the _New Statesman_ of September 25 and October 2, 1915 (“English\r\nTeachers and their Professional Associations”), and April 21 and\r\n28, 1917 (“Professional Associations”). The student will note the\r\ndistinction between two types of associations among professional\r\nbrain-workers, one having essentially Trade Union purposes, the other\r\n(which we distinguish as the Scientific Society) concerned only for the\r\nincrease of knowledge.\r\n\r\n[736] We add as an Appendix an extract from the concluding chapter of\r\nour _Industrial Democracy_, published in 1897, in which we dealt with\r\nthis point.\r\n\r\n[737] We do not discuss here all the difficulties inherent in the\r\ngovernment of a large and populous community--such, for instance, as\r\nthat of combining a large measure of local autonomy (which is what many\r\npeople mean by freedom) with the necessary unity of national policy\r\nand central control (without which there would be gross inequality,\r\ninternecine strife, and chaos). This difficulty has to be faced\r\nalike by Industrial Unionists, Gild Socialists, and the advocates of\r\nDemocracy based on geographical constituencies. Nor have we mentioned\r\nthe problems, in which the Trade Unions have their own wealth of\r\nexperience, as to the relationship between elected representatives and\r\ntheir constituents; between representative assemblies and executive\r\ncommittees; and between executive committees and the official\r\nstaff. These problems and difficulties (on which we have written in\r\nour _Industrial Democracy_) are common to all democratic systems\r\nof administration, whether based on constituencies of producers,\r\nconsumers, or citizens. It seems to us that constituencies of producers\r\npresent special difficulties of their own, such as (i.) that of\r\ndefining the boundaries between industries or services, and (ii.) the\r\nproblem, within an industry or a service, of how to provide for the\r\nrepresentation of numerically unequal distinct sections, groups, or\r\ngrades, each with its own _technique_. The further we go in Democracy\r\nthe more complicated it becomes, and the greater the need for knowledge.\r\n\r\n[738] This is well put by an American economist. “The Trade Union\r\nprogramme, or rather the Trade Union programmes, for each Trade Union\r\nhas a programme of its own, is not the unrelated economic demands\r\nand methods which it is usually conceived to be, but it is a closely\r\nintegrated social philosophy and plan of action. In the case of most\r\nUnion types the programme centres indeed about economic demands and\r\nmethods, but it rests on the broad foundation of the conception of\r\nright, of rights, and of general theory peculiar to the workers; and\r\nit fans out to reflect all the economic, ethical, juridical, and\r\nsocial hopes and fears, aims, attitudes, and aspirations of the group.\r\nIt expresses the workers’ social theory and the rules of the game to\r\nwhich they are committed, not only in industry but in social affairs\r\ngenerally. It is the organised workers’ conceptual world” (_Trade\r\nUnionism in the United States_, by R. F. Hoxie, p. 280).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDICES\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX I\r\n\r\n ON THE ASSUMED CONNECTION BETWEEN THE TRADE UNIONS AND THE GILDS IN\r\n DUBLIN\r\n\r\n\r\nIn Dublin the Trade Union descent from the Gilds is embodied in the\r\nprinted documents of the Unions themselves, and is commonly assumed to\r\nbe confirmed by their possession of the Gild charters. The Trade Union\r\nbanners not only, in many cases, bear the same arms as the old Gilds,\r\nbut often also the date of their incorporation. Thus, the old society\r\nof “regular” carpenters (now a branch of the Amalgamated) claims to\r\ndate from 1490; the “Regular Operative House-painters’ Trade Union”\r\nconnects itself with the Guild of St. Luke, 1670; and the local unions\r\nof bricklayers and plasterers assume the date of the incorporation of\r\nthe Bricklayers’ and Plasterers’ Company by Charles II. (1670). The box\r\nof the Dublin Bricklayers’ Society does, in fact, contain a parchment\r\nwhich purports to be the original charter of the latter Company. How\r\nthis document, given to the exclusively Protestant incorporation of\r\nworking masters, which was abolished by Statute in 1840, came into the\r\npossession of what has always been a mainly Roman Catholic body of\r\nwage-earners, dating certainly from 1830, is not clear. The parchment,\r\nwhich is bereft of its seal and bears on the back, in the handwriting\r\nof a lawyer’s clerk, the words “Bricklayers, 28th June, 1843,” was\r\nprobably thrown aside as worthless after the dissolution of the Company.\r\n\r\nA search among contemporary pamphlets brought to light an interesting\r\nepisode in the history of the Dublin building trades. It appears that,\r\nafter the dissolution of the Company, Benjamin Pemberton, who had been\r\nMaster, and who was evidently a man of energy and ability, attempted\r\nto form an alliance between the then powerful journeymen bricklayers’\r\nand plasterers’ societies and the master bricklayers and plasterers,\r\nin order to resist the common enemy, the “foreign contractor.” This\r\nhad long been a favourite project of Pemberton’s. Already in 1812\r\nhe had urged the rapidly decaying Company to resist the uprising of\r\n“builders,” and to admit Roman Catholic craftsmen. But the Company,\r\nwhich then included scarcely a dozen practising master bricklayers\r\nor plasterers, took no action. In 1832 Pemberton turned to the men,\r\nand vainly proposed to the “Trades Political Union,” a kind of Trades\r\nCouncil, that they should take common action against “the contract\r\nsystem.” At last, in 1846, six years after the abolition of the\r\nCompany, he seems to have succeeded in forming some kind of alliance.\r\nThe journeymen bricklayers and plasterers were induced to accept, from\r\nhimself and his associates, formal certificates of proficiency. Several\r\nof these certificates, signed by Pemberton and other employers, are in\r\nthe possession of the older workmen, but no one could explain to us\r\ntheir use. The alliance probably rested on some promise of preference\r\nfor employment on the one part, and refusal to work for a contractor\r\non the other. This close connection between a leading member of the\r\nCompany and the Trade Unionists may perhaps account for the old\r\ncharter, then become waste paper, finding its way into the Trade Union\r\nchest.\r\n\r\nParticulars of Pemberton’s action will be found in the pamphlet\r\nentitled _An Address of the Bricklayers and Plasterers to the Tradesmen\r\nof the City of Dublin on the necessity of their co-operating for the\r\nattainment of their corporate rights and privileges_, by Benjamin\r\nPemberton (Dublin, 1833, 36 pages), preserved in Vol. 1567 of the\r\n_Haliday Tracts_ in the Royal Irish Academy. In no other case, either\r\nin Dublin or elsewhere, have we found a Trade Union in possession of\r\nany Gild documents or relics.\r\n\r\nThe absolute impossibility of any passage of the Dublin Companies into\r\nthe local Trade Unions will be apparent when we remember that the\r\nbulk of the wage-earning population of the city are, and have always\r\nbeen, Roman Catholics. The Dublin Companies were, to the last, rigidly\r\nconfined to Episcopalian Protestants. Even after the barriers had been\r\nnominally removed by the Catholic Emancipation in 1829, the Companies,\r\nthen shrunk up into little cliques of middle-class capitalists, with\r\nlittle or no connection with the trades, steadfastly refused to admit\r\nany Roman Catholics to membership. A few well-to-do Roman Catholics\r\nforced themselves in between 1829 and 1838 by mandamus. But when\r\ninquiry was made in 1838 by the Commissioners appointed under the\r\nMunicipal Corporations Act, only half a dozen Roman Catholics were\r\nmembers, and the Companies were found to be composed, in the main, of\r\ncapitalists and professional men. There is no evidence that even one\r\nwage-earner was in their ranks. Long before this time the Trade Unions\r\nof Dublin had obtained an unenviable notoriety. Already, in 1824, the\r\nChief Constable of Dublin testified to the complete organisation of\r\nthe operatives in illegal associations. In 1838 O’Connell made his\r\ncelebrated attack upon them in the House of Commons, which led to a\r\nSelect Committee. In short, whilst the Dublin Companies were, until\r\ntheir abolition by the Act of 1840, in much the same condition as those\r\nof London, with the added fact of religious exclusiveness, the Dublin\r\nTrade Unions were long before that date at the height of their power.\r\n\r\nThe adoption by the Dublin Trade Unions of the arms, mottoes, saints,\r\nand dates of origin of the old Dublin Gilds is more interesting as a\r\ntrait of Irish character than as any proof of historic continuity.\r\nThus, in their rules of 1883, the bricklayers content themselves with\r\nrepeating the original preface common to the Trade Societies which\r\nwere formed in the beginning of this century, to the effect that “the\r\njourneyman bricklayers of the City of Dublin have imposed on themselves\r\nthe adoption of the following laudable scheme of raising a Fund for\r\nfriendly society purposes.” A card of membership, dated 1830, bears no\r\nreference to the Gild or Company of Bricklayers and Plasterers from\r\nwhom descent is now claimed. The rules of 1883 are entitled those of\r\nthe “incorporated” brick or stone layers’ association, and in the\r\nedition of 1888 this had developed into the “Ancient Gild of Saint\r\nBartholomew.” Finally, the coat of arms of the old company with the\r\ndate of its incorporation (“A.D. 1670”) appear on the new banner of\r\nthe society. Similarly, the old local society of “Regular Carpenters,”\r\nwhich was well known as a Trade Union in 1824, and was engaged in a\r\nstrike in 1833 (seven years before the abolition of the “Company of\r\nCarpenters, Millers, Masons, and Tylers, or Gild of the fraternity\r\nof the Blessed Virgin Mary, of the house of St. Thomas the Martyr,”\r\nestablished by Henry VIII. in 1532), adopted for the first time, in its\r\nrules of 1881, the coat of arms and motto of the Gild, but retained\r\nits own title of “The United Brothers of St. Joseph.” The card of\r\nmembership, printed in 1887, boldly gives the date of establishment\r\nas 1458, whilst other printed matter places it at 1490. The Dublin\r\npainters now inscribe 1670 on their new banner, but the earliest\r\ntraditions of their members date only from 1820. In short, the Irish\r\nTrade Unionist, with his genuine love for the picturesque, and his\r\nreverence for historical association, has steadily “annexed” antiquity,\r\nand has embraced every opportunity for transferring the origin of his\r\nsociety a few generations further back.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX II\r\n\r\n RULES AND REGULATIONS OF THE GRAND NATIONAL CONSOLIDATED\r\n TRADES UNION OF GREAT BRITAIN AND IRELAND, INSTITUTED FOR\r\n THE PURPOSE OF THE MORE EFFECTUALLY ENABLING THE WORKING\r\n CLASSES TO SECURE, PROTECT, AND ESTABLISH THE RIGHTS OF\r\n INDUSTRY (1834).\r\n\r\n (Goldsmiths’ Library, University of London.)\r\n\r\n\r\nI.

The Executive Council shall act as trustees for all Funds provided\r\nby the C.U., for the adjustment of strikes, the purchasing or renting\r\nof land, establishing provision stores, workshops, etc.; or for any\r\nother purposes connected with the general benefit of the whole of the\r\nUnion.\r\n\r\nXII. All sums for the above purposes to be transmitted from the Lodges\r\nto the Executive Council through some safe and accredited medium.\r\n\r\nXIII. District and Grand Lodges shall have the control of their own\r\nfunds, subject to the levies imposed upon them by the Executive Council.\r\n\r\nXIV. The ordinary weekly subscriptions of members be threepence each\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nXV. No strike or turn out for an _advance_ of wages shall be made by\r\nthe members of any Lodge in the Consolidated Union without the consent\r\nof the Executive Council; but in all cases of a _reduction_ of wages\r\nthe Central Committee of the District shall have the power of deciding\r\nwhether a strike shall or shall not take place; and should such Central\r\nCommittee be necessitated to order a levy in support of such strike\r\nbrought on by such reduction of wages, such order shall be made on\r\nall the Lodges; in the first instance, in the District in which such\r\nreduction hath taken place; and on advice being forwarded to the\r\nExecutive they shall consider the case, and order accordingly.\r\n\r\nXVI. No higher sum than 10s. per week each shall be paid to members\r\nduring a strike or turn out.\r\n\r\nXVII. All Lodges shall be divided into local sections of 20 men each,\r\nor as near that number as may be.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Miscellaneous and Auxiliary Lodges_\r\n\r\nXVIII. In all cases where the number of operatives in a particular\r\nTrade, in any District, is too limited to allow of such Trade forming\r\na Lodge of itself, the members of such Trade shall be permitted to\r\nbecome Unionists by joining the Lodge of any other Trade in the\r\nDistrict. Should there be several Trades in a District thus limited\r\nwith respect to the number of their Operatives, they shall be allowed\r\nto form together a District Miscellaneous Lodge, with permission, in\r\norder to extend the sphere of the brotherhood, to hold out the hand of\r\nfellowship to all really useful Labourers employed productively.\r\n\r\nXIX. And, in order that all acknowledged Friends to the Productive\r\nClasses may attach themselves to the C.U., an Auxiliary Lodge may be\r\nestablished in every City or Town in the Kingdom. The members of each\r\nLodge shall conform to all the Rules and Regulations herein contained,\r\nand be bound in the same manner, and subject to all the Laws of the\r\nG.U.C.T.U.; and shall not, in any manner, or at any time or place,\r\nspeak or write _anything_ in opposition to these Laws or the interests\r\nof the Union aforesaid. The Auxiliary Lodge shall be liable to be\r\ndissolved according to Article XXII.\r\n\r\nXX. Lodges of Industrious Females shall be instituted in every District\r\nwhere it may be practicable; such Lodges to be considered, in every\r\nrespect, as part of, and belonging to, the G.N.C.T.U.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Employment of Turn Outs_\r\n\r\nXXI. In all cases of strikes or turn outs, where it is practicable\r\nto employ Members in the making or producing of such commodities\r\nor articles as are in demand among their brother Unionists, or any\r\nother operatives willing to purchase the same, each Lodge shall\r\nprovide a work-room or shop in which such commodities and articles\r\nmay be manufactured on account of that Lodge, which shall make proper\r\narrangements for the supply of the necessary materials; over which\r\narrangements the Central Committee of the District shall have the\r\ncontrol, subject to the scrutiny of the Grand Lodge Committee of the\r\nTrade on strike.\r\n\r\nXXII. The Grand Lodge of each Trade to have the power of dissolving\r\nany District Lodge, in that Trade, for any violation of these Laws,\r\nany outrage upon the Public Peace, or for gross neglect of Duty. All\r\nBranch, Miscellaneous, or Auxiliary Lodges to be subject to the same\r\ncontrol.\r\n\r\nXXIII. The internal management and general concerns of each Grand or\r\nDistrict Lodge are vested in a Committee of Management, composed of at\r\nleast Seven, and not more than 25 Members, each to be chosen by Ballot,\r\nand elected by having not less than three-fourths of the Votes of the\r\nMembers present, at the time of his election, in his favour. The whole\r\nof this Committee to go out of office Quarterly, eligible, however,\r\nto re-election. The Grand Master, or President, and the Secretary,\r\nor Grand Secretary of a Grand or a District Lodge, to be considered\r\nMembers of its Committee of Management by virtue of their Offices.\r\n\r\nXXIV. Each Grand Lodge, in this C.U., to be considered the centre of\r\ninformation regarding the general affairs of its particular Trade; each\r\nDistrict Lodge to communicate with its Grand Lodge at the end of each\r\nmonth, and to give an account to it of the number of people Members in\r\nthe District Lodge--the gross number of hours of labour performed by\r\nthem in that district--the state of its funds--and any local or general\r\nintelligence that may be considered of interest to the Grand Lodge.\r\n\r\nXXV. The Committee of Management in each Lodge shall sit at least on\r\none evening in every week for the despatch of business--and oftener if\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nXXVI. Each Grand or District Lodge to hold its meetings on one evening\r\nin every month; at which meeting a Report of the Proceedings of the\r\nCommittee, during the past month, shall be laid before the Members,\r\ntogether with an Abstract of the state of the Funds, an account of the\r\nprospects of the Society, and any propositions or By-Laws which the\r\nCommittee may have to suggest for adoption, and any other information\r\nor correspondence of interest to the Members. All nominations of fresh\r\nOfficers to be made at Lodge meetings, and all complaints of Members to\r\nbe considered and discussed therein.\r\n\r\nXXVII. The Grand Master or Deputy Grand Master, President, or\r\nVice-President, or both, shall preside at all meetings of Grand or\r\nDistrict Lodges, to keep order, state and put questions according to\r\nthe sense and intention of the Members, give effect to the resolutions,\r\nand cause them to be put in force; and they shall be addressed by\r\nMembers, during Lodge hours, by their proper titles.\r\n\r\nXXVIII. No subject which does not immediately concern the interests of\r\nthe Trade shall be discussed at any meetings of Committees or Lodges;\r\nand no proposition shall be adopted in either without the consent of\r\nat least three-fourths of the members present at its proposal--the\r\nquestion to be decided by ballot if any Member demand it. Not less\r\nthan five Members of Committee of Management to constitute a Quorum,\r\nprovided the rest have all been duly summoned; no Grand or District\r\nLodge to be considered open unless at least 30 members be present.\r\n\r\nXXIX. Each Grand or District Lodge shall have the power to appoint\r\nSub-Committees to enquire into or manage any affair touching their\r\ninterests, of which Committees the head officers of the Lodge are\r\nalways to be considered Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Secretaries_\r\n\r\nXXX. The duties of a secretary to a Grand or District Lodge are:--To\r\nattend Lodge and Committee meetings and take minutes of the\r\nproceedings, entering the same in a book to be kept for that purpose.\r\n\r\nTo conduct all the correspondence of the Society. To take down the\r\nnames and addresses of parties desirous of being initiated into the\r\nOrder; and upon receiving the initiation fee from each, and entering\r\nthe amount into a book, he will give each party a card, by which they\r\nmay be admitted into the place appointed for the ceremony.\r\n\r\nTo receive the subscriptions of members, entering the same into a small\r\naccount book, numbering the Subscribers from No. 1, and following up\r\nthe sequence in regulation order, giving to each Subscriber a card, on\r\nwhich his contribution or payment shall be noted.\r\n\r\nTo enter all additional weekly payments, and all levies, into separate\r\nsmall books; all subscriptions and payments to be afterwards copied\r\ninto a ledger, ruled expressly for the purpose.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary to be paid an adequate weekly salary; and to be allowed\r\nan Assistant if the amount of business require it.\r\n\r\nThe Secretary of each Grand or District Lodge shall balance his books\r\nonce every fortnight, and the Managing Committee shall audit them,\r\ngoing over each item of receipt and expenditure with strict attention,\r\nchecking the same with scrupulous care; and if found correct, three of\r\nthe Committee shall verify the same by affixing their signatures to the\r\npage on which the balance is struck.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Initiation_\r\n\r\nXXXI. Any of the Officers or Members of a Lodge may be appointed by the\r\nCommittee of Management to perform the Initiation Service; and to have\r\ncharge of the Robes, etc., for that purpose; for which the Committee\r\nmay allow him a reasonable remuneration.\r\n\r\nAny party applying to be initiated must bring forward two witnesses as\r\nto character and the identity of his trade or occupation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Of Branch Lodges_\r\n\r\nXXXII. Branch Lodge Meetings shall be held on one evening in every\r\nweek, in the respective localities; at which Lodges any motion,\r\nproposed by law, etc., may be discussed and considered by the Members\r\nprevious to its being finally submitted to the Grand or District Lodge\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nXXXIII. The Members of each Branch may elect a President to preside at\r\nthe Branch Lodge, and a Secretary to collect subscriptions or levies\r\nfor their Grand or District Lodge; who shall also attend meetings of\r\nthe Committee of Management for instructions and information, and\r\nto submit suggestions, complaints, etc., from his Branch Lodge. No\r\nsalaries or fees to be allowed to officers of Branch Lodges, unless by\r\nthe unanimous consent of their Members.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Wardens, Etc._\r\n\r\nXXXIV. In addition to the Officers before mentioned in these\r\nregulations, there shall be, in each Grand and District Lodge a Warden,\r\nan Inside Tyler, an Outside Tyler, and a Conductor, whose principal\r\nduties are to attend Initiations, and see that no improper persons be\r\nadmitted into the meetings. These officers to be elected in the same\r\nmanner, and at the same periods, as other officers.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Miscellaneous Articles_\r\n\r\nXXXV. Any Member shall be liable to expulsion from the Lodges for any\r\nimproper conduct therein; and shall be excluded from the benefits of\r\nthe Society if his subscriptions be more than six months in arrear,\r\nunless the Committee of Management shall see cause to decide otherwise.\r\n\r\nXXXVI. The _G.U.C.T.U. Gazette_ to be considered the official organ of\r\nthe Executive Council, and the general medium of intelligence on the\r\naffairs of the Union.\r\n\r\nXXXVII. Each Lodge shall, as soon as possible, make arrangements for\r\nfurnishing the means of instituting Libraries or Reading-Rooms, or any\r\nother arrangements, affording them every facility for meeting together\r\nfor friendly conversation, mutual instruction, and rational amusement\r\nor recreation.\r\n\r\nXXXVIII. In all cases, where it be practicable, each Lodge shall\r\nestablish within its locality one or more Depots for provisions and\r\narticles in general domestic use, in order that its Members may be\r\nsupplied with the best of such commodities at little above wholesale\r\nprices.\r\n\r\nXXXIX. Each District and Grand Lodge shall endeavour to institute\r\na Fund for the support of sick and aged Members, and for defraying\r\nthe funeral expenses of deceased Members, on a similar principle to\r\nthat of Benefit Societies; such fund to be kept up by small monthly\r\ncontributions from those Unionists who are willing to subscribe towards\r\nit.\r\n\r\nXL. Each Grand or District Lodge to have the power of making its own\r\nBy-Laws for purposes not comprised in these Regulations; but such\r\nBy-Laws or Laws must not be in opposition to, or in counteraction of,\r\nany of the Articles herein specified.\r\n\r\nXLI. No Member can enter Lodge Meetings without giving the proper\r\nsigns, and producing his card to prove his membership, and that he is\r\nnot in arrears of subscription for more than one month, unless lenity\r\nhas been granted by order of Committee.\r\n\r\nXLII. That a separate Treasurer be appointed for every £20 of the funds\r\ncollected; and that such Treasurers shall not suffer any money to be\r\nwithdrawn from their hands without a written order, signed by at least\r\nthree of the Managing Committee and presented by the Secretary, or one\r\nof the other officers of the Society.\r\n\r\nXLIII. All sums under £30 shall be left in the hands of the Secretary\r\nfor current expenses; but no outlay shall be made by him without an\r\nexpress order from the Managing Committee, signed by at least three of\r\nits Members.\r\n\r\nXLIV. That every Member of this Union do use his best endeavours,\r\nby fair and open argument, and the force of good example, and not\r\nby intimidation or violence, to induce his fellows to join the\r\nbrotherhood, in order that no workmen may remain out of the Union\r\nto undersell them in the market of labour; as, while that is done,\r\nemployers will be enabled to resist the demands of the Unionists,\r\nwhereas, if no operatives remain out of union, employers will be\r\ncompelled to keep up the price of Labour.\r\n\r\nXLV. That each Member of the C.U. pay a Registration Fee of 3d. to\r\ndefray the general expenses; which fee is to be transmitted to the\r\nExecutive once in every month.\r\n\r\nXLVI. That although the design of the Union is, in the first instance,\r\nto raise the wages of the workmen, or prevent any further reduction\r\ntherein, and to diminish the hours of labour, the great and ultimate\r\nobject of it must be to establish the paramount rights of Industry and\r\nHumanity, by instituting such measures as shall effectually prevent\r\nthe ignorant, idle, and useless part of Society from having that undue\r\ncontrol over the fruits of our toil, which, through the agency of a\r\nvicious money system, they at present possess; and that, consequently,\r\nthe Unionists should lose no opportunity of mutually encouraging and\r\nassisting each other in bringing about +A Different Order of Things+,\r\nin which the really useful and intelligent part of society only shall\r\nhave the direction of its affairs, and in which well-directed industry\r\nand virtue shall meet their just distinction and reward, and vicious\r\nidleness its merited contempt and destitution.\r\n\r\nXLVII. All the Rules and Regulations herein contained be subject to the\r\nrevision, alteration, or abrogation of the Grand Delegate Council.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX III\r\n\r\nSLIDING SCALES\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Sliding Scale, an arrangement by which it is agreed in advance that\r\nwages shall vary in a definite relation to changes in the market price\r\nof the product, appears to have been familiar to the iron trade for a\r\ncouple of generations. “About fifty years ago Mr. G. B. Thorneycroft,\r\nof Wolverhampton, head of a well-known firm of iron-masters, suggested\r\nto certain other houses that wages should fluctuate with the price\r\nof ‘marked bars’--these words indicating a quality of iron that then\r\nenjoyed a high reputation. The suggestion was adopted to this extent,\r\nthat when a demand was made by the men for an advance in wages, any\r\nadvance that was given was proportionate to the selling price of\r\n‘marked bars.’ The puddlers received, as a rule, 1s. for each pound of\r\nthe selling price; but on exceptional occasions, a special temporary\r\nadvance or ‘premium’ was conceded. The terms of this arrangement do not\r\nseem to have been reduced to writing, though they remained in force for\r\nmany years, and were well known as the Thorneycroft scale.”[739]\r\n\r\nAt the time of the great strike of Staffordshire puddlers, in 1865,\r\na local understanding of a similar nature appears to have been in\r\nexistence. The joint committee of iron-masters and puddlers, which\r\nwas established at Darlington in 1869 as the “North of England\r\nManufactured Iron Board,” soon worked out a formal sliding scale for\r\nits own guidance. This scale, as well as that adopted by the Midland\r\nIron Trade Board, has been repeatedly revised, abandoned, and again\r\nre-established; but its working has, on the whole, commended itself\r\nto the representatives of the ironworkers, and has, so far as the\r\nprinciple is concerned, produced no important dissensions among them.\r\n“We believe,” said Mr. Trow, the men’s secretary, to the Labour\r\nCommission in 1892, “it would be most satisfactory if this principle\r\nwere generally adopted.... In all our experience of the past we have\r\nhad less trouble in the periods in which sliding scales have obtained.”\r\nThe cause of the exceptional satisfaction of the ironworkers with their\r\nWages Boards and Sliding Scales is obscure, but it may be interesting\r\nto the student to note that the members of the Ironworkers Association\r\nare largely sub-contractors, themselves employing workmen who are\r\nusually outside the Union, and have no direct representation on the\r\nBoard. For a careful statement of the facts as to these Wage Boards\r\nand Sliding Scales in the iron industry, see _The Adjustment of Wages_\r\n(by Sir W. J. Ashley, 1903), pp. 142-151, and specimen rules, reports,\r\nand scales, pp. 268-307. At present (1920) separate Sliding Scales of\r\nthis nature are in force for the Cleveland and the North Lincolnshire\r\nBlast-furnacemen; the Scottish Iron and the Consett Millmen; Brown\r\nBayley’s No. 1 Mill; the Scottish Enginemen and Steel Millmen; the\r\nStaffordshire Sheet Trade; the Midlands Puddling Mills and Forges; and\r\nthe South Wales and Monmouthshire Iron and Steel Trade.\r\n\r\nWidely different has been the result of the Sliding Scale among the\r\ncoal miners. Its introduction into this trade dates from 1874, though\r\nit was not until 1879 that its adoption became common. Since then it\r\nhas been abandoned in all districts, and it is energetically repudiated\r\nby the Miners’ Federation. The following table includes all the Sliding\r\nScales in the coal industry known to us. Between 1879 and 1886 there\r\nwere a number of informal Sliding Scales in force for particular\r\ncollieries, which were mostly superseded by the more general scales, or\r\notherwise came to an end. It is believed that no Sliding Scale is now\r\nin force in any coal district.\r\n\r\n July 24,      1874  South Staffordshire I.

Details of numerous\r\nScales are given in the report made by a Committee to the British\r\nAssociation, entitled _Sliding Scales in the Coal Industry_, which was\r\nprepared by Professor J. E. C. Munro (Manchester, 1885), and in the\r\n_Particulars of Sliding Scales, Past, Present, and Proposed_; printed\r\nby the Lancashire Miners’ Federation in 1886 (Openshaw, 1886, 20 pp.).\r\nSupplementary information is given in Professor Munro’s papers before\r\nthe Manchester Statistical Society, entitled, “Sliding Scales in the\r\nIron Industry” (Manchester, 1885), and “Sliding Scales in the Coal\r\nand Iron Industries from 1885 to 1889” (Manchester, 1889). The whole\r\nquestion is discussed in _The Adjustment of Wages_ (by Sir William\r\nAshley, 1903), pp. 45-71; and in our own _Industrial Democracy_, 1897.\r\n\r\nThe proceedings in the numerous arbitrations in the coal and iron\r\ntrade in the North of England, as well as several others which are\r\nprinted, furnish abundant information on the subject of their working.\r\nA table of the variations of wages under sliding scales was prepared by\r\nProfessor J. E. C. Munro for the Royal Commission on Mining Royalties,\r\nand published as Appendix V. to the First Report, 1890 (C 6195).\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[739] Statement furnished to Professor Munro by Mr. Daniel Jones, of\r\nthe Midland Iron and Steel Wages Board, quoted in _Sliding Scales in\r\nthe Coal and Iron Industries_ (p. 141).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX IV\r\n\r\nTHE SUMMONS TO THE FIRST TRADE UNION CONGRESS\r\n\r\n\r\nNo copy of the invitation to the first Trade Union Congress has been\r\npreserved, either in the archives of the Congress, the Manchester\r\nTrades Council, or any other organisation known to us. Fortunately, it\r\nwas printed in the _Ironworkers’ Journal_ for May 1868. But of this\r\nonly one file now exists, and as the summons is of some historical\r\ninterest we reprint it for convenience of reference.\r\n\r\n                                “Manchester, _April 16, 1868_.\r\n\r\n “Sir--You are requested to lay the following before your\r\n Society. The vital _interests_ involved, it is conceived,\r\n will justify the officials in convening a special meeting\r\n for the consideration thereof.\r\n\r\n “The Manchester and Salford Trades Council having recently\r\n taken into their serious consideration the present aspect\r\n of Trades Unions, and the profound ignorance which prevails\r\n in the public mind with reference to their operations and\r\n principles, together with the probability of an attempt\r\n being made by the Legislature, during the present Session\r\n of Parliament, to introduce a measure which might prove\r\n detrimental to the interests of such Societies _unless some\r\n prompt and decisive action be taken by the working classes\r\n themselves_, beg most respectfully to intimate that it has\r\n been decided to hold in Manchester, as the main centre of\r\n industry in the provinces, a Congress of the representatives\r\n of Trades Councils, Federations of Trades, and Trade\r\n Societies in general.\r\n\r\n “The Congress will assume the character of the Annual\r\n Meetings of the Social Science Association, in the\r\n transactions of which Society the artisan class is almost\r\n excluded; and papers previously carefully prepared by\r\n such Societies as elect to do so, will be laid before the\r\n Congress on the various subjects which at the present time\r\n affect the Trade Societies, each paper to be followed by\r\n discussion on the points advanced, with a view of the merits\r\n and demerits of each question being thoroughly ventilated\r\n through the medium of the public press. It is further\r\n decided that the subjects treated upon shall include the\r\n following:\r\n\r\n “1. Trade Unions an absolute necessity.\r\n\r\n “2. Trade Unions and Political Economy.\r\n\r\n “3.

The following table gives the local distribution of 1,507,026\r\nTrade Unionists in 1892. The distribution was, in most cases, made by\r\nbranches, special estimates being prepared for us in a few instances\r\nby the officers of the Unions concerned. With regard to a few Unions\r\nhaving about 4000 members no local distribution could be arrived at.\r\n\r\n _Table showing the distribution of Trade Union membership in\r\n 1892 in each part of the

UNION MEMBERSHIP\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunately impossible to present any complete statistics of\r\nTrade Union membership at different periods. Until the appointment, in\r\n1886, of John Burnett as Labour Correspondent to the Board of Trade,\r\nno attempt was made to collect any statistics of the movement; and the\r\nold Unions seldom possess a complete series of their own archives. The\r\nFriendly Society of Ironfounders, it is true, has exact figures since\r\nits establishment in 1809. No total figures can be given with any\r\nconfidence.\r\n\r\nThe following tables may be useful as placing on record such\r\ncomparative figures as we have been able to collect:\r\n\r\n  1.  Amalgamated Society of Engineers.\r\n  2.  Friendly Society of Ironfounders.\r\n  3.  Steam Engine Makers’ Society.\r\n  4.  Associated Ironmoulders of Scotland.\r\n  5.  United Society of Boilermakers and Iron Shipwrights.\r\n  6.  Operative Stonemasons’ Friendly Society.\r\n  7.  Operative Bricklayers’ Society.\r\n  8.

A quarter of a\r\ncentury later George Howell and others could talk vaguely of a million\r\nmembers, but we doubt whether this number was reached until the years\r\nof good trade that followed 1871. In 1878-80 there was a great falling\r\noff, and we doubt whether the aggregate of a million was again reached\r\nuntil 1885. In 1892 we recorded a million and a half. Not until the end\r\nof the century were two millions attained--a number doubled by 1915,\r\nand in the last four or five years again increased by over fifty per\r\ncent.\r\n\r\n_Table showing the aggregate Trade Union Membership in groups of\r\nIndustries at the end of each of the years 1892-1917 inclusive._[745]\r\n\r\n -----+---------+--------+---------+--------+---------+----------+-----------------------------+---------\r\n      |         |        |  Metal, |        |         |          |                             |\r\n      |         | Mining | Engin-  |        |         |          |                             | Total,\r\n Year.|Building.|   and  | eering, |Textile.|Clothing.|Transport.|        Other Trades.        |  all\r\n      |         | Quarry-|   and   |        |         |          |                             | Unions.\r\n      |         |   in   |  Ship-  |        |         |          |                             |\r\n      |         |        |building.|        |         |          |                             |\r\n -----+---------+--------+---------+--------+---------+----------+-----------------------------+---------\r\n  1892| 157,971 | 315,272|  279,534| 204,022|  83,299 |  154,947 |            307,313          |1,502,358\r\n  1893| 172,870 | 318,112|  266,813| 205,546|  80,768 |  142,084 |            293,224          |1,479,417\r\n  1894| 178,721 | 307,276|  263,572| 214,331|  81,786 |  123,896 |            266,718          |1,436,300\r\n  1895| 179,283 | 280,065|  269,169| 218,805|  78,560 |  120,475 |            261,479          |1,407,836\r\n  1896| 193,341 | 279,977|  303,518| 217,950|  76,997 |  134,877 |            287,805          |1,494,465\r\n  1897| 215,603 | 283,054|  319,745| 218,619|  75,852 |  183,994 |            317,131          |1,613,998\r\n      |         |        |         |        |         |          | +--------+--------+-------+ |\r\n      |         |        |         |        |         |          |/Printing,| Wood-  |   Other\\|\r\n      |         |        |         |        |         |          |  Paper,  |working.|  Trades.|\r\n      |         |        |         |        |         |          |   etc.   |        |         |\r\n  1898| 232,040 | 366,731|  312,444| 240,895|  69,954 |  147,957 |   54,436 |   ---- |  264,074|1,688,531\r\n  1899| 249,988 | 445,706|  335,746| 245,301|  66,777 |  163,685 |   56,727 |   ---- |  284,640|1,848,570\r\n  1900| 253,412 | 524,150|  342,079| 245,438|  67,183 |  171,599 |   57,228 |   ---- |  294,615|1,955,704\r\n  1901| 248,967 | 530,953|  338,468| 243,474|  65,660 |  169,199 |   58,274 |   ---- |  311,766|1,966,761\r\n  1902| 245,141 | 532,082|  337,064| 246,829|  64,094 |  158,714 |   59,062 |   ---- |  310,321|1,953,307\r\n  1903| 238,141 | 529,028|  337,122| 244,081|  61,713 |  159,051 |   60,138 |   ---- |  301,769|1,931,043\r\n  1904| 225,149 | 501,764|  334,822| 246,473|  58,598 |  159,788 |   62,428 |   ---- |  306,087|1,895,109\r\n  1905| 205,179 | 496,828|  340,364| 266,416|  60,394 |  167,017 |   62,368 |   ---- |  321,807|1,920,373\r\n  1906| 196,492 | 571,336|  361,453| 302,968|  59,806 |  190,155 |   64,451 |   ---- |  367,145|2,113,806\r\n  1907| 193,190 | 703,344|  376,805| 354,427|  68,810 |  238,813 |   68,221 |   ---- |  403,136|2,406,746\r\n  1908| 177,718 | 719,384|  365,134| 362,540|  65,637 |  230,642 |   72,970 |  41,797|  353,505|2,388,727\r\n  1909| 162,278 | 722,639|  359,838| 366,445|  65,882 |  224,037 |   71,531 |  39,240|  357,177|2,369,067\r\n  1910| 156,985 | 731,305|  370,055| 379,644|  67,158 |  245,223 |   74,275 |  38,881|  382,816|2,446,342\r\n  1911| 173,182 | 752,419|  415,176| 436,927|  74,423 |  513,538 |   77,252 |  45,474|  530,512|3,018,903\r\n  1912| 203,773 | 757,147|  479,471| 478,097|  91,855 |  514,724 |   76,807 |  50,853|  635,107|3,287,884\r\n  1913| 248,647 | 915,734|  538,541| 515,684| 105,929 |  699,952 |   84,414 |  64,442|  813,772|3,987,115\r\n  1914| 235,828 | 870,198|  557,769| 497,494| 102,538 |  705,501 |   92,283 |  64,296|  796,902|3,918,809\r\n  1915| 228,475 | 857,183|  633,502| 507,731| 114,085 |  737,004 |   97,290 |  65,210|  886,313|4,126,793\r\n  1916| 229,272 | 877,694|  695,347| 530,411| 121,656 |  803,872 |   97,669 |  69,403|1,012,623|4,437,947\r\n  1917| 257,286 | 941,120|  847,202| 627,919| 149,756 |  903,109 |  109,586 |  83,369|1,360,165|5,287,522\r\n -----+---------+--------+---------+--------+---------+----------+----------+--------+---------+---------\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[740] Established January 10, 1851.

In _Industrial Democracy_, 1897, we gave a supplementary\r\nlist, 23 pages long. We do not reproduce these lists, to which the\r\nstudent can always refer; nor have we attempted to bring them down to\r\ndate. The really useful material for Trade Union study is to be found\r\nin the publications of the Trade Unions themselves--the innumerable\r\neditions of rules, the thousands of annual and monthly reports, the\r\nvoluminous lists of piecework prices, the intricate working agreements,\r\nthe verbatim reports of conferences, delegate meetings and proceedings\r\nbefore Conciliation and Arbitration Boards--which are ignored by the\r\nBritish Museum, and are practically never preserved in local public\r\nlibraries. We made an extensive collection in 1891-97, which we have\r\ndeposited in the British Library of Political Science, attached to the\r\nLondon School of Economics and Political Science, where it has been,\r\nto some extent, kept up to date, and where it is accessible to any\r\nserious student. Some old pamphlets and reports of interest are in\r\nthe Goldsmiths’ Library at the University of London. Of Trade Union\r\npublications since 1913 the most extensive collection is that of the\r\nLabour Research Department, attached to the Labour Party, 34 Eccleston\r\nSquare, London.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX VIII\r\n\r\nTHE RELATIONSHIP OF TRADE UNIONISM TO THE GOVERNMENT OF INDUSTRY\r\n\r\n\r\nIn our work on _Industrial Democracy_, published in 1897, we formulated\r\nthe following tentative conclusions with regard to the participation of\r\nthe workmen’s organisations in industrial management, and the relation\r\nof Trade Unionism to political Democracy:\r\n\r\n“This survey of the changes required in Trade Union policy leads us\r\nstraight to a conclusion as to the part which Trade Unionism will be\r\nexpected to play in the management of the industry of a democratic\r\nstate. The interminable series of decisions, which together make up\r\nindustrial administration, fall into three main classes. There is,\r\nfirst, the decision as to what shall be produced--that is to say, the\r\nexact commodity or service to be supplied to the consumers. There is,\r\nsecondly, the judgement as to the manner in which the production shall\r\ntake place, the adoption of material, the choice of processes, and the\r\nselection of human agents. Finally, there is the altogether different\r\nquestion of the conditions under which these human agents shall be\r\nemployed--the temperature, atmosphere, and sanitary arrangements amid\r\nwhich they shall work, the intensity and duration of their toil, and\r\nthe wages given as its reward.\r\n\r\n“To obtain for the community the maximum satisfaction it is essential\r\nthat the needs and desires of the consumers should be the main factor\r\nin determining the commodities and services to be produced. Whether\r\nthese needs and desires can best be ascertained and satisfied by the\r\nprivate enterprise of capitalist profit-makers, keenly interested\r\nin securing custom, or by the public service of salaried officials,\r\nintent on pleasing associations of consumers (as in the British\r\nCo-operative Movement), or associations of citizens (the Municipality\r\nor the State), is at present the crucial problem of Democracy. But\r\nwhichever way this issue may be decided, one thing is certain, namely,\r\nthat the several sections of manual workers, enrolled in their Trade\r\nUnions, will have, under private enterprise or Collectivism, no more\r\nto do with the determination of what is to be produced than any other\r\ncitizens or consumers. As manual workers and wage-earners, they bring\r\nto the problem no specialised knowledge; and as persons fitted for the\r\nperformance of particular services, they are even biassed against the\r\ninevitable changes in demand which characterise progressive community.\r\nThis is even more the case with regard to the second department of\r\nindustrial administration--the adoption of material, the choice of\r\nprocesses, and the selection of human agents. Here, the Trade Unions\r\nconcerned are specially disqualified, not only by their ignorance of\r\nthe possible alternatives, but also by their overwhelming bias in\r\nfavour of a particular material, a particular process, or a particular\r\ngrade of workers, irrespective of whether these are or are not the\r\nbest adapted for the gratification of the consumers’ desires. On\r\nthe other hand, the directors of industry, whether thrown up by the\r\ncompetitive struggle or deliberately appointed by the consumers or\r\ncitizens, have been specially picked out and trained to discover the\r\nbest means of satisfying the consumers’ desires. Moreover, the bias of\r\ntheir self-interest coincides with the object of their customers or\r\nemployers--that is to say, the best and cheapest production. Thus, if\r\nwe leave out of account the disturbing influence of monopoly in private\r\nenterprise, and corruption in public administration, it would at first\r\nsight seem as if we might safely leave the organisation of production\r\nand distribution under the one system as under the other to the expert\r\nknowledge of the directors of industry. But this is subject to one\r\nall-important qualification. The permanent bias of the profitmaker,\r\nand even of the salaried official of the Co-operative Society, the\r\nMunicipality, or the Government Department, is to lower the expense\r\nof production. So far as immediate results are concerned, it seems\r\nequally advantageous whether this reduction of cost is secured by a\r\nbetter choice of materials, processes, or men, or by some lowering\r\nof wages or other worsening of the conditions upon which the human\r\nagents are employed. But the democratic state is, as we have seen,\r\nvitally interested in upholding the highest possible Standard of Life\r\nof all its citizens, and especially of the manual workers who form\r\nfour-fifths of the whole. Hence the bias of the directors of industry\r\nin favor of cheapness has, in the interests of the community, to be\r\nperpetually controlled and guided by a determination to maintain, and\r\nprogressively to raise, the conditions of employment.\r\n\r\n“This leads us to the third branch of industrial administration--the\r\nsettlement of the conditions under which the human beings are to be\r\nemployed. The adoption of one material rather than another, the choice\r\nbetween alternative processes or alternative ways of organising the\r\nfactory, the selection of particular grades of workers, or even of a\r\nparticular foreman, may affect, for the worse, the Standard of Life of\r\nthe operatives concerned. This indirect influence on the conditions\r\nof employment passes imperceptibly into the direct determination\r\nof the wages, hours, and other terms of the wage contract. On all\r\nthese matters the consumers, on the one hand, and the directors of\r\nindustry on the other, are permanently disqualified from acting as\r\narbiters. In our chapter on ‘The Higgling of the Market’ we described\r\nhow, in the elaborate division of labour which characterises the\r\nmodern industrial system, thousands of workers co-operate in the\r\nbringing to market of a single commodity; and no consumer, even if\r\nhe desired it, could possibly ascertain or judge of the conditions\r\nof employment in all these varied trades. Thus, the consumers of\r\nall classes are not only biassed in favour of low prices; they are\r\ncompelled to accept this apparent or genuine cheapness as the only\r\npracticable test of efficiency of production. And though the immediate\r\nemployer of each section of workpeople knows the hours that they work\r\nand the wages that they receive, he is precluded by the stream of\r\ncompetitive pressure, transmitted through the retail shopkeeper and\r\nthe wholesale trader, from effectively resisting the promptings of his\r\nown self-interest towards a constant cheapening of labour. Moreover,\r\nthough he may be statistically aware of the conditions of employment\r\nhis lack of personal experience of those conditions deprives him of\r\nany real knowledge of their effects. To the brain-working captain of\r\nindustry, maintaining himself and his family on thousands a year,\r\nthe manual-working wage-earner seems to belong to another species,\r\nhaving mental faculties and bodily needs altogether different from his\r\nown. Men and women of the upper or middle classes are totally unable\r\nto realise what state of body and mind, what level of character and\r\nconduct, result from a life spent, from childhood to old age, amid the\r\ndirt, the smell, the noise, the ugliness, and the vitiated atmosphere\r\nof the workshop; under constant subjection to the peremptory, or it may\r\nbe brutal, orders of the foreman; kept continuously at the laborious\r\nmanual toil for sixty or seventy hours in every week of the year; and\r\nmaintained by the food, clothing, house-accommodation, recreation, and\r\nfamily life which are implied by a precarious income of between ten\r\nshillings and two pounds a week. If the democratic state is to attain\r\nits fullest and finest development, it is essential that the actual\r\nneeds and desires of the human agents concerned should be the main\r\nconsiderations in determining the conditions of employment. Here then\r\nwe find the special function of the Trade Union in the administration\r\nof industry. The simplest member of the working-class organisation\r\nknows at any rate where the shoe pinches. The Trade Union official is\r\nspecially selected by his fellow-workmen for his capacity to express\r\nthe grievances from which they suffer, and is trained by his calling\r\nin devising remedies for them. But in expressing the desires of their\r\nmembers, and in insisting on the necessary reforms, the Trade Unions\r\nact within the constant friction-brake supplied by the need of securing\r\nemployment. It is always the consumers and the consumers alone, whether\r\nthey act through profit-making _entrepreneurs_ or through their own\r\nsalaried officials, who determine how many of each particular grade of\r\nworkers they care to employ on the conditions demanded.... Thus we find\r\nno neat formula for defining the rights and duties of the individual\r\nin society. In the democratic state every individual is both master\r\nand servant. In the work that he does for the community in return\r\nfor his subsistence he is, and must remain, a servant, subject to\r\nthe instructions and directions of those whose desires he is helping\r\nto satisfy. As a Citizen-Elector jointly with his fellows, and as a\r\nConsumer to the extent of his demand, he is a master, determining,\r\nfree from any superior, what shall be done. Hence, it is the supreme\r\nparadox of democracy that every man is a servant in respect of the\r\nmatters of which he possesses the most expert proficiency, namely,\r\nthe professional craft to which he devotes his working hours; and he\r\nis a master over that on which he knows no more than anybody else,\r\nnamely, the general interests of the community as a whole. In this\r\nparadox, we suggest, lies at once the justification and the strength\r\nof democracy. It is not, as is commonly asserted by the superficial,\r\nthat Ignorance rules over Knowledge, and Mediocrity over Capacity:\r\nIn the administration of society Knowledge and Capacity can make no\r\nreal and durable progress except by acting on and through the minds of\r\nthe common human material which it is desired to improve. It is only\r\nby carrying along with him the ‘average sensual man,’ that even the\r\nwisest and most philanthropic reformer, however autocratic his power,\r\ncan genuinely change the face of things. Moreover, not even the wisest\r\nof men can be trusted with that supreme authority which comes from\r\nthe union of knowledge, capacity, and opportunity with the power of\r\nuntrammelled and ultimate decision. Democracy is an expedient--perhaps\r\nthe only practicable expedient--for preventing the concentration in any\r\nsingle individual or in any single class of what inevitably becomes,\r\nwhen so concentrated, a terrible engine of oppression. The autocratic\r\nemperor, served by a trained bureaucracy, seems to the Anglo-Saxon a\r\nperilously near approach to such a concentration. If democracy meant,\r\nas early observers imagined, a similar concentration of Knowledge and\r\nPower in the hands of the numerical majority for the time being, it\r\nmight easily become as injurious a tyranny as any autocracy. An actual\r\nstudy of the spontaneous democracies of Anglo-Saxon workmen, or, as we\r\nsuggest, of any other democratic institutions, reveals the splitting\r\nup of this dangerous authority into two parts. Whether in political or\r\nin industrial democracy, though it is the Citizen who, as Elector or\r\nConsumer, ultimately gives the order, it is the Professional Expert who\r\nadvises what the order shall be.\r\n\r\n“It is another aspect of this paradox that, in the democratic state, no\r\nman minds his own business. In the economic sphere this is a necessary\r\nconsequence of division of labour; Robinson Crusoe, producing solely\r\nfor his own consumption, being the last man who minded nothing but\r\nhis own business. The extreme complication brought about by universal\r\nproduction for exchange in itself implies that every one works with a\r\nview to fulfilling the desires of other people. The crowding together\r\nof dense populations, and especially the co-operative enterprises which\r\nthen arise, extend in every direction this spontaneous delegation to\r\nprofessional experts of what the isolated individual once deemed ‘his\r\nown business.’ Thus, the citizen in a modern municipality no longer\r\nproduces his own food or makes his own clothes; no longer protects\r\nhis own life or property; no longer fetches his own water; no longer\r\nmakes his own thoroughfares, or cleans or lights them when made; no\r\nlonger removes his own refuse or even disinfects his own dwelling.\r\nHe no longer educates his own children, or doctors and nurses his\r\nown invalids. Trade Unionism adds to the long list of functions thus\r\ndelegated to professional experts the settlement of the conditions on\r\nwhich the citizen will agree to co-operate in the national service.\r\nIn the fully-developed democratic state the Citizen will be always\r\nminding other people’s business. In his professional occupation he\r\nwill, whether as brain-worker or manual labourer, be continually\r\nstriving to fulfil the desires of those whom he serves; whilst as an\r\nElector, in his parish or his co-operative society, his Trade Union or\r\nhis political association, he will be perpetually passing judgment on\r\nissues in which his personal interest is no greater than that of his\r\nfellows.\r\n\r\n“If, then, we are asked whether democracy, as shown by an analysis of\r\nTrade Unionism, is consistent with Individual Liberty, we are compelled\r\nto answer by asking, What is Liberty? If Liberty means every man being\r\nhis own master, and following his own impulses, then it is clearly\r\ninconsistent, not so much with democracy or any other particular form\r\nof government, as with the crowding together of population in dense\r\nmasses, division of labour, and, as we think, civilisation itself. What\r\nparticular individuals, sections, or classes usually mean by ‘freedom\r\nof contract,’ ‘freedom of association,’ or ‘freedom of enterprise’\r\nis freedom of opportunity to use the power that they happen to\r\npossess--that is to say, to compel other less powerful people to accept\r\ntheir terms. This sort of personal freedom in a community composed of\r\nunequal units is not distinguishable from compulsion. It is, therefore,\r\nnecessary to define Liberty before talking about it; a definition which\r\nevery man will frame according to his own view of what is socially\r\ndesirable. We ourselves understand by the words ‘Liberty’ or ‘Freedom,’\r\nnot any quantum of natural or inalienable rights, but such conditions\r\nof existence in the community as do, in practice, result in the utmost\r\npossible development of faculty in the individual human being. Now, in\r\nthis sense democracy is not only consistent with Liberty, but is, as\r\nit seems to us, the only way of securing the largest amount of it. It\r\nis open to argument whether other forms of government may not achieve\r\na fuller development of the faculties of particular individuals or\r\nclasses. To an autocrat, untrammelled rule over a whole kingdom may\r\nmean an exercise of his individual faculties, and a development of\r\nhis individual personality, such as no other situation in life would\r\nafford. An aristocracy or government by one class in the interests\r\nof one class, may conceivably enable that class to develop a\r\nperfection in physical grace or intellectual charm attainable by no\r\nother system of society. Similarly, it might be argued that, where\r\nthe ownership of the means of production and the administration of\r\nindustry are unreservedly left to the capitalist class, this ‘freedom\r\nof enterprise’ would result in a development of faculty among the\r\ncaptains of industry which could not otherwise be reached. We dissent\r\nfrom all these propositions, if only on the ground that the fullest\r\ndevelopment of personal character requires the pressure of discipline\r\nas well as the stimulus of opportunity. But however untrammelled\r\npower may affect the character of those who possess it, autocracy,\r\naristocracy, and plutocracy have all, from the point of view of\r\nthe lover of liberty, one fatal defect--they necessarily involve a\r\nrestriction in the opportunity for development of faculty among the\r\ngreat mass of the population. It is only when the resources of the\r\nnation are deliberately organised and dealt with for the benefit, not\r\nof particular individuals or classes, but of the entire community;\r\nwhen the administration of industry, as of every other branch of human\r\naffairs, becomes the function of specialised experts, working through\r\ndeliberately adjusted Common Rules; and when the ultimate decision on\r\npolicy rests in no other hands than those of the citizens themselves,\r\nthat the maximum aggregate development of individual intellect and\r\nindividual character in the community as a whole can be attained.\r\n\r\n“For our analysis helps us to disentangle from the complex influences\r\non individual development those caused by democracy itself. The\r\nuniversal specialisation and delegation which, as we suggest,\r\ndemocratic institutions involve, necessarily imply a great increase\r\nin capacity and efficiency, if only because specialisation in service\r\nmeans expertness, and delegation compels selection. This deepening and\r\nnarrowing of professional skill may be expected, in the fully-developed\r\ndemocratic state, to be accompanied by a growth in culture of which our\r\npresent imperfect organisation gives us no adequate idea. So long as\r\nlife is one long scramble for personal gain--still more, when it is one\r\nlong struggle against destitution--there is no free time or strength\r\nfor much development of the sympathetic, intellectual, artistic, or\r\nreligious faculties. When the conditions of employment are deliberately\r\nregulated so as to secure adequate food, education, and leisure to\r\nevery capable citizen, the great mass of the population will, for the\r\nfirst time, have any real chance of expanding in friendship and family\r\naffection, and of satisfying the instinct for knowledge or beauty. It\r\nis an even more unique attribute of democracy that it is always taking\r\nthe mind of the individual off his own narrow interests and immediate\r\nconcerns, and forcing him to give his thoughts and leisure, not to\r\nsatisfying his own desires, but to considering the needs and desires of\r\nhis fellows. As an Elector--still more as a chosen Representative--in\r\nhis parish, in his professional association, in his co-operative\r\nsociety, or in the wider political institutions of his state, the\r\n‘average sensual man’ is perpetually impelled to appreciate and to\r\ndecide issues of public policy. The working of democratic institutions\r\nmeans, therefore, one long training in enlightened altruism, one\r\ncontinual weighing, not of the advantage of the particular act to the\r\nparticular individual, at the particular moment, but of those ‘larger\r\nexpediencies’ on which all successful conduct of social life depends.\r\n\r\n“If now, at the end of this long analysis, we try to formulate our\r\ndominant impression, it is a sense of the vastness and complexity\r\nof democracy itself. Modern civilised states are driven to this\r\ncomplication by the dense massing of their populations, and the course\r\nof industrial development. The very desire to secure mobility in the\r\ncrowd compels the adoption of one regulation after another, which limit\r\nthe right of every man to use the air, the water, the land, and even\r\nthe artificially produced instruments of production, in the way that he\r\nmay think best. The very discovery of improved industrial methods, by\r\nleading to specialisation, makes manual labourer and brainworker alike\r\ndependent on the rest of the community for the means of subsistence,\r\nand subordinates them, even in their own crafts, to the action of\r\nothers. In the world of civilisation and progress, no man can be his\r\nown master. But the very fact that, in modern society, the individual\r\nthus necessarily loses control over his own life, makes him desire to\r\nregain collectively what has become individually impossible. Hence\r\nthe irresistible tendency to popular government, in spite of all its\r\ndifficulties and dangers. But democracy is still the Great Unknown.\r\nOf its full scope and import we can yet catch only glimpses. As one\r\ndepartment of social life after another becomes the subject of careful\r\nexamination we shall gradually attain to a more complete vision. Our\r\nown tentative conclusions, derived from the study of one manifestation\r\nof the democratic spirit, may, we hope, not only suggest hypotheses for\r\nfuture verification, but also stimulate other students to carry out\r\noriginal investigations into the larger and perhaps more significant\r\ntypes of democratic organisation.”\r\n\r\nIn 1920, after nearly a quarter of a century of further experience and\r\nconsideration, we should, in some respects, put this differently. The\r\ngrowth, among all classes, and especially among the manual workers and\r\nthe technicians, of what we may call corporate self-consciousness and\r\npublic spirit, and the diffusion of education--coupled with further\r\ndiscoveries in the technique of democratic institutions--would lead us\r\nto-day to include, and even to put in the forefront, certain additional\r\nsuggestions, which we can here only summarise briefly.\r\n\r\nThere is, in the first place, a genuine need for, and a real social\r\nadvantage in giving recognition to, the contemporary transformation\r\nin the status of the manual working wage-earners, on the one hand,\r\nand of the technicians on the other, as compared with that of the\r\nmanager or mere “captain of industry.” This change of status, which is,\r\nperhaps, the most important feature of the industrial history of the\r\npast quarter of a century, will be most easily accorded its legitimate\r\nrecognition in those industries and services in which the profit-making\r\ncapitalist proprietor is dispensed with in favour of public ownership,\r\nwhether national, municipal, or co-operative. This is, incidentally,\r\nan important reason for what is called “nationalisation.” It is a\r\nreal social gain that the General Secretary of the Swiss Railwaymen’s\r\nTrade Union should sit as one of the five members of the supreme\r\ngoverning board of the Swiss railway administration. We ourselves look\r\nfor the admission of nominees of the manual workers, as well as of\r\nthe technicians, upon the executive boards and committees, on terms\r\nof complete equality with the other members, in all publicly owned\r\nindustries and services; not merely, or even mainly, for the sake\r\nof the advantages of the counsel and criticism that the newcomers\r\nmay bring from new standpoints, but principally for the sake of\r\nboth inspiring and satisfying the increasing sense of corporate\r\nself-consciousness and public spirit among all those employed in these\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nIn the second place we should lay stress on the change that is taking\r\nplace in the nature (and in the conception) of authority itself. In\r\nour analysis of 1897 we confined ourselves unduly to a separation of\r\nspheres of authority. Whilst still regarding that analytic separation\r\nof “management” into three classes of judgements or decisions as\r\nfundamentally valid, we should nowadays attach even more importance\r\nto the ways in which authority itself, in industry as well as in the\r\nrest of government, is being rapidly transformed, alike in substance\r\nand in methods of expression. The need for final decisions will remain,\r\nnot merely in emergencies, but also as to policy; and it is of high\r\nimportance to vest the responsibility for decision, according to the\r\nnature of the case, in the right hands. But we suggest that a great\r\ndeed of the old autocracy in industry and services, once deemed to\r\nbe indispensable, is ceasing to be necessary to efficiency, and will\r\naccordingly, as Democracy becomes more genuinely accepted, gradually\r\nbe dispensed with. A steadily increasing sphere will, except in\r\nmatters of emergency, be found for consultation among all grades and\r\nsections concerned, out of which will emerge judgements and decisions\r\narrived at, very largely, by common consent. This will, we believe,\r\nproduce actually a higher standard of industrial efficiency than mere\r\nautocracy could ever hope for. Where knowledge is a common possession\r\nthe facts themselves will often decide; and though decisions may be\r\nshort, sharp, and necessarily formulated by the appropriate person,\r\nthey will not inevitably bear the impress of (or be resented as) the\r\ndictates of irresponsible autocracy. We may instance two large classes\r\nof considerations which will, we think, with great social advantage,\r\ncome to be matters for mutual consultation in those committees\r\nand councils which already characterise the administration of all\r\nindustry on a large scale, whether under private or public ownership,\r\nand which will, in the future, be increasingly representative of\r\nall grades of workers by hand or by brain. To such committees and\r\ncouncils there will come, as a matter of course, a stream of reports\r\nfrom the disinterested outside costing experts, which will carry with\r\nthem no coercive authority, but which will graphically reveal the\r\nefficiency results, so far as regards cost and output, of each part\r\nof the enterprise, in comparison both with its own past, and with\r\nthe corresponding results of other analogous enterprises. Similarly,\r\nthere will come a stream of financial and merely statistical reports\r\nfrom equally disinterested outside auditors and statisticians,\r\nmaking graphic revelations as to the progress of the enterprise, in\r\ncomparison with its own previous experience and with the progress\r\nof like enterprises elsewhere. Further, there will be a stream of\r\nwhat we may call scientific reports, also from disinterested outside\r\nexperts, not only describing new inventions and discoveries in the\r\ntechnique of the particular enterprise, but suggesting, in the light\r\nof recent surveys of the work, how they could be practically applied\r\nto its peculiar circumstances. These three classes of reports, all of\r\nthem by disinterested experts, engaged in keeping under review all\r\nanalogous enterprises at home or abroad, and having neither interest\r\nin, nor authority over, any of them, will, we suggest, be discussed by\r\nthe members of the committees and councils on terms of equality; the\r\ndecisions being taken, according to the nature of the case, by those in\r\nwhom the responsibility for decision may be vested.\r\n\r\nBut there will be a second extensive class of reports of a different\r\ncharacter, conveying not statements of fact but views of policy.\r\nThere will, we must assume, be reports from those responsible, not\r\nmerely or mainly for satisfying the existing generation of consumers,\r\nproducers, or citizens, but for safeguarding the interests of the\r\ncommunity as a whole, in the future as well as in the present. There\r\nwill be the reports from the organs of the consumers or users of the\r\nparticular commodity or service (such as the District Committees\r\nrepresenting telephone users set up by the Postmaster-General as\r\norgans of, criticism and suggestion for his telephone administration).\r\nFinally there will be reports conveying criticisms and suggestions\r\nfrom committees or councils representing other enterprises, or other\r\nsections of producers (whether technicians or manual workers), which\r\nmay have something to communicate that they deem important. These\r\nreports will, none of them, come with coercive authority, but merely\r\nas conveying information, to be considered in the consultations out of\r\nwhich the necessary decisions will emerge.\r\n\r\nOpinions may differ as to the competence to take part in such\r\nconsultations of the selected representatives of the manual workers\r\nand the technicians respectively. We are ourselves of opinion that,\r\ntaking the business as a whole, such representatives will be found to\r\ncompare, in competence, quite favourably with the average member of a\r\nBoard of Directors. But whether or not the counsels and decisions of\r\ngreat industrial enterprises are likely to be much improved by such\r\nconsultations--and we confidently expect that they will be--we suggest\r\nthat it is predominantly in this form that the principles of Democracy\r\nmay, in practice, be applied to industrial administration; and that it\r\nwill be for the Professional Associations of the technicians and the\r\nTrade Unions of the manual workers to prove themselves equal to the\r\ntransformation in their status that this or any other application of\r\nDemocracy involves.\r\n\r\nBut here we must pause. In a future work on the achievements, policy,\r\nand immediate controversies of the British Labour and Socialist\r\nMovement we shall give the historical and the psychological analysis,\r\nin the light of the experience of the past few decades, upon which we\r\nbase our present conclusions.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n  Aberdare, 514\r\n\r\n  Aberdare, Lord, 276-7, 285\r\n\r\n  Aberdeen, cotton-weavers of, 82;\r\n    tailors of, 79\r\n\r\n  Abnormal place, 513-16\r\n\r\n  Abraham, William, 596\r\n\r\n  Acetylene Welders, 495\r\n\r\n  Acland, Sir A.
