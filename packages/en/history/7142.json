This belief was not without its\r\ngrounds. The preparations of both the combatants were in every\r\ndepartment in the last state of perfection; and he could see the rest\r\nof the Hellenic race taking sides in the quarrel; those who delayed\r\ndoing so at once having it in contemplation. Indeed this was the\r\ngreatest movement yet known in history, not only of the Hellenes, but\r\nof a large part of the barbarian world—I had almost said of mankind.\r\nFor though the events of remote antiquity, and even those that more\r\nimmediately preceded the war, could not from lapse of time be clearly\r\nascertained, yet the evidences which an inquiry carried as far back as\r\nwas practicable leads me to trust, all point to the conclusion that\r\nthere was nothing on a great scale, either in war or in other matters.\r\n\r\nFor instance, it is evident that the country now called Hellas had in\r\nancient times no settled population; on the contrary, migrations were\r\nof frequent occurrence, the several tribes readily abandoning their\r\nhomes under the pressure of superior numbers. Without commerce, without\r\nfreedom of communication either by land or sea, cultivating no more of\r\ntheir territory than the exigencies of life required, destitute of\r\ncapital, never planting their land (for they could not tell when an\r\ninvader might not come and take it all away, and when he did come they\r\nhad no walls to stop him), thinking that the necessities of daily\r\nsustenance could be supplied at one place as well as another, they\r\ncared little for shifting their habitation, and consequently neither\r\nbuilt large cities nor attained to any other form of greatness. The\r\nrichest soils were always most subject to this change of masters; such\r\nas the district now called Thessaly, Boeotia, most of the Peloponnese,\r\nArcadia excepted, and the most fertile parts of the rest of Hellas. The\r\ngoodness of the land favoured the aggrandizement of particular\r\nindividuals, and thus created faction which proved a fertile source of\r\nruin. It also invited invasion. Accordingly Attica, from the poverty of\r\nits soil enjoying from a very remote period freedom from faction, never\r\nchanged its inhabitants. And here is no inconsiderable exemplification\r\nof my assertion that the migrations were the cause of there being no\r\ncorrespondent growth in other parts. The most powerful victims of war\r\nor faction from the rest of Hellas took refuge with the Athenians as a\r\nsafe retreat; and at an early period, becoming naturalized, swelled the\r\nalready large population of the city to such a height that Attica\r\nbecame at last too small to hold them, and they had to send out\r\ncolonies to Ionia.\r\n\r\nThere is also another circumstance that contributes not a little to my\r\nconviction of the weakness of ancient times. Before the Trojan war\r\nthere is no indication of any common action in Hellas, nor indeed of\r\nthe universal prevalence of the name; on the contrary, before the time\r\nof Hellen, son of Deucalion, no such appellation existed, but the\r\ncountry went by the names of the different tribes, in particular of the\r\nPelasgian. It was not till Hellen and his sons grew strong in\r\nPhthiotis, and were invited as allies into the other cities, that one\r\nby one they gradually acquired from the connection the name of\r\nHellenes; though a long time elapsed before that name could fasten\r\nitself upon all. The best proof of this is furnished by Homer. Born\r\nlong after the Trojan War, he nowhere calls all of them by that name,\r\nnor indeed any of them except the followers of Achilles from Phthiotis,\r\nwho were the original Hellenes: in his poems they are called Danaans,\r\nArgives, and Achaeans. He does not even use the term barbarian,\r\nprobably because the Hellenes had not yet been marked off from the rest\r\nof the world by one distinctive appellation. It appears therefore that\r\nthe several Hellenic communities, comprising not only those who first\r\nacquired the name, city by city, as they came to understand each other,\r\nbut also those who assumed it afterwards as the name of the whole\r\npeople, were before the Trojan war prevented by their want of strength\r\nand the absence of mutual intercourse from displaying any collective\r\naction.\r\n\r\nIndeed, they could not unite for this expedition till they had gained\r\nincreased familiarity with the sea. And the first person known to us by\r\ntradition as having established a navy is Minos. He made himself master\r\nof what is now called the Hellenic sea, and ruled over the Cyclades,\r\ninto most of which he sent the first colonies, expelling the Carians\r\nand appointing his own sons governors; and thus did his best to put\r\ndown piracy in those waters, a necessary step to secure the revenues\r\nfor his own use.\r\n\r\nFor in early times the Hellenes and the barbarians of the coast and\r\nislands, as communication by sea became more common, were tempted to\r\nturn pirates, under the conduct of their most powerful men; the motives\r\nbeing to serve their own cupidity and to support the needy. They would\r\nfall upon a town unprotected by walls, and consisting of a mere\r\ncollection of villages, and would plunder it; indeed, this came to be\r\nthe main source of their livelihood, no disgrace being yet attached to\r\nsuch an achievement, but even some glory. An illustration of this is\r\nfurnished by the honour with which some of the inhabitants of the\r\ncontinent still regard a successful marauder, and by the question we\r\nfind the old poets everywhere representing the people as asking of\r\nvoyagers—“Are they pirates?”—as if those who are asked the question\r\nwould have no idea of disclaiming the imputation, or their\r\ninterrogators of reproaching them for it. The same rapine prevailed\r\nalso by land.\r\n\r\nAnd even at the present day many of Hellas still follow the old\r\nfashion, the Ozolian Locrians for instance, the Aetolians, the\r\nAcarnanians, and that region of the continent; and the custom of\r\ncarrying arms is still kept up among these continentals, from the old\r\npiratical habits. The whole of Hellas used once to carry arms, their\r\nhabitations being unprotected and their communication with each other\r\nunsafe; indeed, to wear arms was as much a part of everyday life with\r\nthem as with the barbarians. And the fact that the people in these\r\nparts of Hellas are still living in the old way points to a time when\r\nthe same mode of life was once equally common to all. The Athenians\r\nwere the first to lay aside their weapons, and to adopt an easier and\r\nmore luxurious mode of life; indeed, it is only lately that their rich\r\nold men left off the luxury of wearing undergarments of linen, and\r\nfastening a knot of their hair with a tie of golden grasshoppers, a\r\nfashion which spread to their Ionian kindred and long prevailed among\r\nthe old men there. On the contrary, a modest style of dressing, more in\r\nconformity with modern ideas, was first adopted by the Lacedaemonians,\r\nthe rich doing their best to assimilate their way of life to that of\r\nthe common people. They also set the example of contending naked,\r\npublicly stripping and anointing themselves with oil in their gymnastic\r\nexercises. Formerly, even in the Olympic contests, the athletes who\r\ncontended wore belts across their middles; and it is but a few years\r\nsince that the practice ceased. To this day among some of the\r\nbarbarians, especially in Asia, when prizes for boxing and wrestling\r\nare offered, belts are worn by the combatants. And there are many other\r\npoints in which a likeness might be shown between the life of the\r\nHellenic world of old and the barbarian of to-day.\r\n\r\nWith respect to their towns, later on, at an era of increased\r\nfacilities of navigation and a greater supply of capital, we find the\r\nshores becoming the site of walled towns, and the isthmuses being\r\noccupied for the purposes of commerce and defence against a neighbour.\r\nBut the old towns, on account of the great prevalence of piracy, were\r\nbuilt away from the sea, whether on the islands or the continent, and\r\nstill remain in their old sites. For the pirates used to plunder one\r\nanother, and indeed all coast populations, whether seafaring or not.\r\n\r\nThe islanders, too, were great pirates. These islanders were Carians\r\nand Phoenicians, by whom most of the islands were colonized, as was\r\nproved by the following fact. During the purification of Delos by\r\nAthens in this war all the graves in the island were taken up, and it\r\nwas found that above half their inmates were Carians: they were\r\nidentified by the fashion of the arms buried with them, and by the\r\nmethod of interment, which was the same as the Carians still follow.\r\nBut as soon as Minos had formed his navy, communication by sea became\r\neasier, as he colonized most of the islands, and thus expelled the\r\nmalefactors. The coast population now began to apply themselves more\r\nclosely to the acquisition of wealth, and their life became more\r\nsettled; some even began to build themselves walls on the strength of\r\ntheir newly acquired riches. For the love of gain would reconcile the\r\nweaker to the dominion of the stronger, and the possession of capital\r\nenabled the more powerful to reduce the smaller towns to subjection.\r\nAnd it was at a somewhat later stage of this development that they went\r\non the expedition against Troy.\r\n\r\nWhat enabled Agamemnon to raise the armament was more, in my opinion,\r\nhis superiority in strength, than the oaths of Tyndareus, which bound\r\nthe suitors to follow him. Indeed, the account given by those\r\nPeloponnesians who have been the recipients of the most credible\r\ntradition is this. First of all Pelops, arriving among a needy\r\npopulation from Asia with vast wealth, acquired such power that,\r\nstranger though he was, the country was called after him; and this\r\npower fortune saw fit materially to increase in the hands of his\r\ndescendants. Eurystheus had been killed in Attica by the Heraclids.\r\nAtreus was his mother’s brother; and to the hands of his relation, who\r\nhad left his father on account of the death of Chrysippus, Eurystheus,\r\nwhen he set out on his expedition, had committed Mycenæ and the\r\ngovernment. As time went on and Eurystheus did not return, Atreus\r\ncomplied with the wishes of the Mycenæans, who were influenced by fear\r\nof the Heraclids—besides, his power seemed considerable, and he had not\r\nneglected to court the favour of the populace—and assumed the sceptre\r\nof Mycenæ and the rest of the dominions of Eurystheus. And so the power\r\nof the descendants of Pelops came to be greater than that of the\r\ndescendants of Perseus. To all this Agamemnon succeeded. He had also a\r\nnavy far stronger than his contemporaries, so that, in my opinion, fear\r\nwas quite as strong an element as love in the formation of the\r\nconfederate expedition. The strength of his navy is shown by the fact\r\nthat his own was the largest contingent, and that of the Arcadians was\r\nfurnished by him; this at least is what Homer says, if his testimony is\r\ndeemed sufficient. Besides, in his account of the transmission of the\r\nsceptre, he calls him\r\n\r\nOf many an isle, and of all Argos king.\r\n\r\n\r\nNow Agamemnon’s was a continental power; and he could not have been\r\nmaster of any except the adjacent islands (and these would not be\r\nmany), but through the possession of a fleet.\r\n\r\nAnd from this expedition we may infer the character of earlier\r\nenterprises. Now Mycenæ may have been a small place, and many of the\r\ntowns of that age may appear comparatively insignificant, but no exact\r\nobserver would therefore feel justified in rejecting the estimate given\r\nby the poets and by tradition of the magnitude of the armament. For I\r\nsuppose if Lacedaemon were to become desolate, and the temples and the\r\nfoundations of the public buildings were left, that as time went on\r\nthere would be a strong disposition with posterity to refuse to accept\r\nher fame as a true exponent of her power. And yet they occupy\r\ntwo-fifths of Peloponnese and lead the whole, not to speak of their\r\nnumerous allies without. Still, as the city is neither built in a\r\ncompact form nor adorned with magnificent temples and public edifices,\r\nbut composed of villages after the old fashion of Hellas, there would\r\nbe an impression of inadequacy. Whereas, if Athens were to suffer the\r\nsame misfortune, I suppose that any inference from the appearance\r\npresented to the eye would make her power to have been twice as great\r\nas it is. We have therefore no right to be sceptical, nor to content\r\nourselves with an inspection of a town to the exclusion of a\r\nconsideration of its power; but we may safely conclude that the\r\narmament in question surpassed all before it, as it fell short of\r\nmodern efforts; if we can here also accept the testimony of Homer’s\r\npoems, in which, without allowing for the exaggeration which a poet\r\nwould feel himself licensed to employ, we can see that it was far from\r\nequalling ours. He has represented it as consisting of twelve hundred\r\nvessels; the Boeotian complement of each ship being a hundred and\r\ntwenty men, that of the ships of Philoctetes fifty. By this, I\r\nconceive, he meant to convey the maximum and the minimum complement: at\r\nany rate, he does not specify the amount of any others in his catalogue\r\nof the ships. That they were all rowers as well as warriors we see from\r\nhis account of the ships of Philoctetes, in which all the men at the\r\noar are bowmen. Now it is improbable that many supernumeraries sailed,\r\nif we except the kings and high officers; especially as they had to\r\ncross the open sea with munitions of war, in ships, moreover, that had\r\nno decks, but were equipped in the old piratical fashion. So that if we\r\nstrike the average of the largest and smallest ships, the number of\r\nthose who sailed will appear inconsiderable, representing, as they did,\r\nthe whole force of Hellas. And this was due not so much to scarcity of\r\nmen as of money. Difficulty of subsistence made the invaders reduce the\r\nnumbers of the army to a point at which it might live on the country\r\nduring the prosecution of the war. Even after the victory they obtained\r\non their arrival—and a victory there must have been, or the\r\nfortifications of the naval camp could never have been built—there is\r\nno indication of their whole force having been employed; on the\r\ncontrary, they seem to have turned to cultivation of the Chersonese and\r\nto piracy from want of supplies. This was what really enabled the\r\nTrojans to keep the field for ten years against them; the dispersion of\r\nthe enemy making them always a match for the detachment left behind. If\r\nthey had brought plenty of supplies with them, and had persevered in\r\nthe war without scattering for piracy and agriculture, they would have\r\neasily defeated the Trojans in the field, since they could hold their\r\nown against them with the division on service. In short, if they had\r\nstuck to the siege, the capture of Troy would have cost them less time\r\nand less trouble. But as want of money proved the weakness of earlier\r\nexpeditions, so from the same cause even the one in question, more\r\nfamous than its predecessors, may be pronounced on the evidence of what\r\nit effected to have been inferior to its renown and to the current\r\nopinion about it formed under the tuition of the poets.\r\n\r\nEven after the Trojan War, Hellas was still engaged in removing and\r\nsettling, and thus could not attain to the quiet which must precede\r\ngrowth. The late return of the Hellenes from Ilium caused many\r\nrevolutions, and factions ensued almost everywhere; and it was the\r\ncitizens thus driven into exile who founded the cities. Sixty years\r\nafter the capture of Ilium, the modern Boeotians were driven out of\r\nArne by the Thessalians, and settled in the present Boeotia, the former\r\nCadmeis; though there was a division of them there before, some of whom\r\njoined the expedition to Ilium. Twenty years later, the Dorians and the\r\nHeraclids became masters of Peloponnese; so that much had to be done\r\nand many years had to elapse before Hellas could attain to a durable\r\ntranquillity undisturbed by removals, and could begin to send out\r\ncolonies, as Athens did to Ionia and most of the islands, and the\r\nPeloponnesians to most of Italy and Sicily and some places in the rest\r\nof Hellas. All these places were founded subsequently to the war with\r\nTroy.\r\n\r\nBut as the power of Hellas grew, and the acquisition of wealth became\r\nmore an object, the revenues of the states increasing, tyrannies were\r\nby their means established almost everywhere—the old form of government\r\nbeing hereditary monarchy with definite prerogatives—and Hellas began\r\nto fit out fleets and apply herself more closely to the sea. It is said\r\nthat the Corinthians were the first to approach the modern style of\r\nnaval architecture, and that Corinth was the first place in Hellas\r\nwhere galleys were built; and we have Ameinocles, a Corinthian\r\nshipwright, making four ships for the Samians. Dating from the end of\r\nthis war, it is nearly three hundred years ago that Ameinocles went to\r\nSamos. Again, the earliest sea-fight in history was between the\r\nCorinthians and Corcyraeans; this was about two hundred and sixty years\r\nago, dating from the same time. Planted on an isthmus, Corinth had from\r\ntime out of mind been a commercial emporium; as formerly almost all\r\ncommunication between the Hellenes within and without Peloponnese was\r\ncarried on overland, and the Corinthian territory was the highway\r\nthrough which it travelled. She had consequently great money resources,\r\nas is shown by the epithet “wealthy” bestowed by the old poets on the\r\nplace, and this enabled her, when traffic by sea became more common, to\r\nprocure her navy and put down piracy; and as she could offer a mart for\r\nboth branches of the trade, she acquired for herself all the power\r\nwhich a large revenue affords. Subsequently the Ionians attained to\r\ngreat naval strength in the reign of Cyrus, the first king of the\r\nPersians, and of his son Cambyses, and while they were at war with the\r\nformer commanded for a while the Ionian sea. Polycrates also, the\r\ntyrant of Samos, had a powerful navy in the reign of Cambyses, with\r\nwhich he reduced many of the islands, and among them Rhenea, which he\r\nconsecrated to the Delian Apollo. About this time also the Phocaeans,\r\nwhile they were founding Marseilles, defeated the Carthaginians in a\r\nsea-fight. These were the most powerful navies. And even these,\r\nalthough so many generations had elapsed since the Trojan war, seem to\r\nhave been principally composed of the old fifty-oars and long-boats,\r\nand to have counted few galleys among their ranks. Indeed it was only\r\nshortly the Persian war, and the death of Darius the successor of\r\nCambyses, that the Sicilian tyrants and the Corcyraeans acquired any\r\nlarge number of galleys. For after these there were no navies of any\r\naccount in Hellas till the expedition of Xerxes; Aegina, Athens, and\r\nothers may have possessed a few vessels, but they were principally\r\nfifty-oars. It was quite at the end of this period that the war with\r\nAegina and the prospect of the barbarian invasion enabled Themistocles\r\nto persuade the Athenians to build the fleet with which they fought at\r\nSalamis; and even these vessels had not complete decks.\r\n\r\nThe navies, then, of the Hellenes during the period we have traversed\r\nwere what I have described. All their insignificance did not prevent\r\ntheir being an element of the greatest power to those who cultivated\r\nthem, alike in revenue and in dominion. They were the means by which\r\nthe islands were reached and reduced, those of the smallest area\r\nfalling the easiest prey. Wars by land there were none, none at least\r\nby which power was acquired; we have the usual border contests, but of\r\ndistant expeditions with conquest for object we hear nothing among the\r\nHellenes. There was no union of subject cities round a great state, no\r\nspontaneous combination of equals for confederate expeditions; what\r\nfighting there was consisted merely of local warfare between rival\r\nneighbours. The nearest approach to a coalition took place in the old\r\nwar between Chalcis and Eretria; this was a quarrel in which the rest\r\nof the Hellenic name did to some extent take sides.\r\n\r\nVarious, too, were the obstacles which the national growth encountered\r\nin various localities. The power of the Ionians was advancing with\r\nrapid strides, when it came into collision with Persia, under King\r\nCyrus, who, after having dethroned Croesus and overrun everything\r\nbetween the Halys and the sea, stopped not till he had reduced the\r\ncities of the coast; the islands being only left to be subdued by\r\nDarius and the Phoenician navy.\r\n\r\nAgain, wherever there were tyrants, their habit of providing simply for\r\nthemselves, of looking solely to their personal comfort and family\r\naggrandizement, made safety the great aim of their policy, and\r\nprevented anything great proceeding from them; though they would each\r\nhave their affairs with their immediate neighbours. All this is only\r\ntrue of the mother country, for in Sicily they attained to very great\r\npower. Thus for a long time everywhere in Hellas do we find causes\r\nwhich make the states alike incapable of combination for great and\r\nnational ends, or of any vigorous action of their own.\r\n\r\nBut at last a time came when the tyrants of Athens and the far older\r\ntyrannies of the rest of Hellas were, with the exception of those in\r\nSicily, once and for all put down by Lacedaemon; for this city, though\r\nafter the settlement of the Dorians, its present inhabitants, it\r\nsuffered from factions for an unparalleled length of time, still at a\r\nvery early period obtained good laws, and enjoyed a freedom from\r\ntyrants which was unbroken; it has possessed the same form of\r\ngovernment for more than four hundred years, reckoning to the end of\r\nthe late war, and has thus been in a position to arrange the affairs of\r\nthe other states. Not many years after the deposition of the tyrants,\r\nthe battle of Marathon was fought between the Medes and the Athenians.\r\nTen years afterwards, the barbarian returned with the armada for the\r\nsubjugation of Hellas. In the face of this great danger, the command of\r\nthe confederate Hellenes was assumed by the Lacedaemonians in virtue of\r\ntheir superior power; and the Athenians, having made up their minds to\r\nabandon their city, broke up their homes, threw themselves into their\r\nships, and became a naval people. This coalition, after repulsing the\r\nbarbarian, soon afterwards split into two sections, which included the\r\nHellenes who had revolted from the King, as well as those who had aided\r\nhim in the war. At the end of the one stood Athens, at the head of the\r\nother Lacedaemon, one the first naval, the other the first military\r\npower in Hellas. For a short time the league held together, till the\r\nLacedaemonians and Athenians quarrelled and made war upon each other\r\nwith their allies, a duel into which all the Hellenes sooner or later\r\nwere drawn, though some might at first remain neutral. So that the\r\nwhole period from the Median war to this, with some peaceful intervals,\r\nwas spent by each power in war, either with its rival, or with its own\r\nrevolted allies, and consequently afforded them constant practice in\r\nmilitary matters, and that experience which is learnt in the school of\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nThe policy of Lacedaemon was not to exact tribute from her allies, but\r\nmerely to secure their subservience to her interests by establishing\r\noligarchies among them; Athens, on the contrary, had by degrees\r\ndeprived hers of their ships, and imposed instead contributions in\r\nmoney on all except Chios and Lesbos. Both found their resources for\r\nthis war separately to exceed the sum of their strength when the\r\nalliance flourished intact.\r\n\r\nHaving now given the result of my inquiries into early times, I grant\r\nthat there will be a difficulty in believing every particular detail.\r\nThe way that most men deal with traditions, even traditions of their\r\nown country, is to receive them all alike as they are delivered,\r\nwithout applying any critical test whatever. The general Athenian\r\npublic fancy that Hipparchus was tyrant when he fell by the hands of\r\nHarmodius and Aristogiton, not knowing that Hippias, the eldest of the\r\nsons of Pisistratus, was really supreme, and that Hipparchus and\r\nThessalus were his brothers; and that Harmodius and Aristogiton\r\nsuspecting, on the very day, nay at the very moment fixed on for the\r\ndeed, that information had been conveyed to Hippias by their\r\naccomplices, concluded that he had been warned, and did not attack him,\r\nyet, not liking to be apprehended and risk their lives for nothing,\r\nfell upon Hipparchus near the temple of the daughters of Leos, and slew\r\nhim as he was arranging the Panathenaic procession.\r\n\r\nThere are many other unfounded ideas current among the rest of the\r\nHellenes, even on matters of contemporary history, which have not been\r\nobscured by time. For instance, there is the notion that the\r\nLacedaemonian kings have two votes each, the fact being that they have\r\nonly one; and that there is a company of Pitane, there being simply no\r\nsuch thing. So little pains do the vulgar take in the investigation of\r\ntruth, accepting readily the first story that comes to hand. On the\r\nwhole, however, the conclusions I have drawn from the proofs quoted\r\nmay, I believe, safely be relied on. Assuredly they will not be\r\ndisturbed either by the lays of a poet displaying the exaggeration of\r\nhis craft, or by the compositions of the chroniclers that are\r\nattractive at truth’s expense; the subjects they treat of being out of\r\nthe reach of evidence, and time having robbed most of them of\r\nhistorical value by enthroning them in the region of legend. Turning\r\nfrom these, we can rest satisfied with having proceeded upon the\r\nclearest data, and having arrived at conclusions as exact as can be\r\nexpected in matters of such antiquity. To come to this war: despite the\r\nknown disposition of the actors in a struggle to overrate its\r\nimportance, and when it is over to return to their admiration of\r\nearlier events, yet an examination of the facts will show that it was\r\nmuch greater than the wars which preceded it.\r\n\r\nWith reference to the speeches in this history, some were delivered\r\nbefore the war began, others while it was going on; some I heard\r\nmyself, others I got from various quarters; it was in all cases\r\ndifficult to carry them word for word in one’s memory, so my habit has\r\nbeen to make the speakers say what was in my opinion demanded of them\r\nby the various occasions, of course adhering as closely as possible to\r\nthe general sense of what they really said. And with reference to the\r\nnarrative of events, far from permitting myself to derive it from the\r\nfirst source that came to hand, I did not even trust my own\r\nimpressions, but it rests partly on what I saw myself, partly on what\r\nothers saw for me, the accuracy of the report being always tried by the\r\nmost severe and detailed tests possible. My conclusions have cost me\r\nsome labour from the want of coincidence between accounts of the same\r\noccurrences by different eye-witnesses, arising sometimes from\r\nimperfect memory, sometimes from undue partiality for one side or the\r\nother. The absence of romance in my history will, I fear, detract\r\nsomewhat from its interest; but if it be judged useful by those\r\ninquirers who desire an exact knowledge of the past as an aid to the\r\ninterpretation of the future, which in the course of human things must\r\nresemble if it does not reflect it, I shall be content. In fine, I have\r\nwritten my work, not as an essay which is to win the applause of the\r\nmoment, but as a possession for all time.\r\n\r\nThe Median War, the greatest achievement of past times, yet found a\r\nspeedy decision in two actions by sea and two by land. The\r\nPeloponnesian War was prolonged to an immense length, and, long as it\r\nwas, it was short without parallel for the misfortunes that it brought\r\nupon Hellas. Never had so many cities been taken and laid desolate,\r\nhere by the barbarians, here by the parties contending (the old\r\ninhabitants being sometimes removed to make room for others); never was\r\nthere so much banishing and blood-shedding, now on the field of battle,\r\nnow in the strife of faction. Old stories of occurrences handed down by\r\ntradition, but scantily confirmed by experience, suddenly ceased to be\r\nincredible; there were earthquakes of unparalleled extent and violence;\r\neclipses of the sun occurred with a frequency unrecorded in previous\r\nhistory; there were great droughts in sundry places and consequent\r\nfamines, and that most calamitous and awfully fatal visitation, the\r\nplague. All this came upon them with the late war, which was begun by\r\nthe Athenians and Peloponnesians by the dissolution of the thirty\r\nyears’ truce made after the conquest of Euboea. To the question why\r\nthey broke the treaty, I answer by placing first an account of their\r\ngrounds of complaint and points of difference, that no one may ever\r\nhave to ask the immediate cause which plunged the Hellenes into a war\r\nof such magnitude. The real cause I consider to be the one which was\r\nformally most kept out of sight. The growth of the power of Athens, and\r\nthe alarm which this inspired in Lacedaemon, made war inevitable. Still\r\nit is well to give the grounds alleged by either side which led to the\r\ndissolution of the treaty and the breaking out of the war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\n\r\nCauses of the War—The Affair of Epidamnus—The Affair of Potidæa\r\n\r\n\r\nThe city of Epidamnus stands on the right of the entrance of the Ionic\r\nGulf. Its vicinity is inhabited by the Taulantians, an Illyrian people.\r\nThe place is a colony from Corcyra, founded by Phalius, son of\r\nEratocleides, of the family of the Heraclids, who had according to\r\nancient usage been summoned for the purpose from Corinth, the mother\r\ncountry. The colonists were joined by some Corinthians, and others of\r\nthe Dorian race. Now, as time went on, the city of Epidamnus became\r\ngreat and populous; but falling a prey to factions arising, it is said,\r\nfrom a war with her neighbours the barbarians, she became much\r\nenfeebled, and lost a considerable amount of her power. The last act\r\nbefore the war was the expulsion of the nobles by the people. The\r\nexiled party joined the barbarians, and proceeded to plunder those in\r\nthe city by sea and land; and the Epidamnians, finding themselves hard\r\npressed, sent ambassadors to Corcyra beseeching their mother country\r\nnot to allow them to perish, but to make up matters between them and\r\nthe exiles, and to rid them of the war with the barbarians. The\r\nambassadors seated themselves in the temple of Hera as suppliants, and\r\nmade the above requests to the Corcyraeans. But the Corcyraeans refused\r\nto accept their supplication, and they were dismissed without having\r\neffected anything.\r\n\r\nWhen the Epidamnians found that no help could be expected from Corcyra,\r\nthey were in a strait what to do next. So they sent to Delphi and\r\ninquired of the God whether they should deliver their city to the\r\nCorinthians and endeavour to obtain some assistance from their\r\nfounders. The answer he gave them was to deliver the city and place\r\nthemselves under Corinthian protection. So the Epidamnians went to\r\nCorinth and delivered over the colony in obedience to the commands of\r\nthe oracle. They showed that their founder came from Corinth, and\r\nrevealed the answer of the god; and they begged them not to allow them\r\nto perish, but to assist them. This the Corinthians consented to do.\r\nBelieving the colony to belong as much to themselves as to the\r\nCorcyraeans, they felt it to be a kind of duty to undertake their\r\nprotection. Besides, they hated the Corcyraeans for their contempt of\r\nthe mother country. Instead of meeting with the usual honours accorded\r\nto the parent city by every other colony at public assemblies, such as\r\nprecedence at sacrifices, Corinth found herself treated with contempt\r\nby a power which in point of wealth could stand comparison with any\r\neven of the richest communities in Hellas, which possessed great\r\nmilitary strength, and which sometimes could not repress a pride in the\r\nhigh naval position of an island whose nautical renown dated from the\r\ndays of its old inhabitants, the Phaeacians. This was one reason of the\r\ncare that they lavished on their fleet, which became very efficient;\r\nindeed they began the war with a force of a hundred and twenty galleys.\r\n\r\nAll these grievances made Corinth eager to send the promised aid to\r\nEpidamnus. Advertisement was made for volunteer settlers, and a force\r\nof Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Corinthians was dispatched. They marched\r\nby land to Apollonia, a Corinthian colony, the route by sea being\r\navoided from fear of Corcyraean interruption. When the Corcyraeans\r\nheard of the arrival of the settlers and troops in Epidamnus, and the\r\nsurrender of the colony to Corinth, they took fire. Instantly putting\r\nto sea with five-and-twenty ships, which were quickly followed by\r\nothers, they insolently commanded the Epidamnians to receive back the\r\nbanished nobles—(it must be premised that the Epidamnian exiles had\r\ncome to Corcyra and, pointing to the sepulchres of their ancestors, had\r\nappealed to their kindred to restore them)—and to dismiss the\r\nCorinthian garrison and settlers. But to all this the Epidamnians\r\nturned a deaf ear. Upon this the Corcyraeans commenced operations\r\nagainst them with a fleet of forty sail. They took with them the\r\nexiles, with a view to their restoration, and also secured the services\r\nof the Illyrians. Sitting down before the city, they issued a\r\nproclamation to the effect that any of the natives that chose, and the\r\nforeigners, might depart unharmed, with the alternative of being\r\ntreated as enemies. On their refusal the Corcyraeans proceeded to\r\nbesiege the city, which stands on an isthmus; and the Corinthians,\r\nreceiving intelligence of the investment of Epidamnus, got together an\r\narmament and proclaimed a colony to Epidamnus, perfect political\r\nequality being guaranteed to all who chose to go. Any who were not\r\nprepared to sail at once might, by paying down the sum of fifty\r\nCorinthian drachmae, have a share in the colony without leaving\r\nCorinth. Great numbers took advantage of this proclamation, some being\r\nready to start directly, others paying the requisite forfeit. In case\r\nof their passage being disputed by the Corcyraeans, several cities were\r\nasked to lend them a convoy. Megara prepared to accompany them with\r\neight ships, Pale in Cephallonia with four; Epidaurus furnished five,\r\nHermione one, Troezen two, Leucas ten, and Ambracia eight. The Thebans\r\nand Phliasians were asked for money, the Eleans for hulls as well;\r\nwhile Corinth herself furnished thirty ships and three thousand heavy\r\ninfantry.\r\n\r\nWhen the Corcyraeans heard of their preparations they came to Corinth\r\nwith envoys from Lacedaemon and Sicyon, whom they persuaded to\r\naccompany them, and bade her recall the garrison and settlers, as she\r\nhad nothing to do with Epidamnus. If, however, she had any claims to\r\nmake, they were willing to submit the matter to the arbitration of such\r\nof the cities in Peloponnese as should be chosen by mutual agreement,\r\nand that the colony should remain with the city to whom the arbitrators\r\nmight assign it. They were also willing to refer the matter to the\r\noracle at Delphi. If, in defiance of their protestations, war was\r\nappealed to, they should be themselves compelled by this violence to\r\nseek friends in quarters where they had no desire to seek them, and to\r\nmake even old ties give way to the necessity of assistance. The answer\r\nthey got from Corinth was that, if they would withdraw their fleet and\r\nthe barbarians from Epidamnus, negotiation might be possible; but,\r\nwhile the town was still being besieged, going before arbitrators was\r\nout of the question. The Corcyraeans retorted that if Corinth would\r\nwithdraw her troops from Epidamnus they would withdraw theirs, or they\r\nwere ready to let both parties remain in statu quo, an armistice being\r\nconcluded till judgment could be given.\r\n\r\nTurning a deaf ear to all these proposals, when their ships were manned\r\nand their allies had come in, the Corinthians sent a herald before them\r\nto declare war and, getting under way with seventy-five ships and two\r\nthousand heavy infantry, sailed for Epidamnus to give battle to the\r\nCorcyraeans. The fleet was under the command of Aristeus, son of\r\nPellichas, Callicrates, son of Callias, and Timanor, son of Timanthes;\r\nthe troops under that of Archetimus, son of Eurytimus, and Isarchidas,\r\nson of Isarchus. When they had reached Actium in the territory of\r\nAnactorium, at the mouth of the mouth of the Gulf of Ambracia, where\r\nthe temple of Apollo stands, the Corcyraeans sent on a herald in a\r\nlight boat to warn them not to sail against them. Meanwhile they\r\nproceeded to man their ships, all of which had been equipped for\r\naction, the old vessels being undergirded to make them seaworthy. On\r\nthe return of the herald without any peaceful answer from the\r\nCorinthians, their ships being now manned, they put out to sea to meet\r\nthe enemy with a fleet of eighty sail (forty were engaged in the siege\r\nof Epidamnus), formed line, and went into action, and gained a decisive\r\nvictory, and destroyed fifteen of the Corinthian vessels. The same day\r\nhad seen Epidamnus compelled by its besiegers to capitulate; the\r\nconditions being that the foreigners should be sold, and the\r\nCorinthians kept as prisoners of war, till their fate should be\r\notherwise decided.\r\n\r\nAfter the engagement the Corcyraeans set up a trophy on Leukimme, a\r\nheadland of Corcyra, and slew all their captives except the\r\nCorinthians, whom they kept as prisoners of war. Defeated at sea, the\r\nCorinthians and their allies repaired home, and left the Corcyraeans\r\nmasters of all the sea about those parts. Sailing to Leucas, a\r\nCorinthian colony, they ravaged their territory, and burnt Cyllene, the\r\nharbour of the Eleans, because they had furnished ships and money to\r\nCorinth. For almost the whole of the period that followed the battle\r\nthey remained masters of the sea, and the allies of Corinth were\r\nharassed by Corcyraean cruisers. At last Corinth, roused by the\r\nsufferings of her allies, sent out ships and troops in the fall of the\r\nsummer, who formed an encampment at Actium and about Chimerium, in\r\nThesprotis, for the protection of Leucas and the rest of the friendly\r\ncities. The Corcyraeans on their part formed a similar station on\r\nLeukimme. Neither party made any movement, but they remained\r\nconfronting each other till the end of the summer, and winter was at\r\nhand before either of them returned home.\r\n\r\nCorinth, exasperated by the war with the Corcyraeans, spent the whole\r\nof the year after the engagement and that succeeding it in building\r\nships, and in straining every nerve to form an efficient fleet; rowers\r\nbeing drawn from Peloponnese and the rest of Hellas by the inducement\r\nof large bounties. The Corcyraeans, alarmed at the news of their\r\npreparations, being without a single ally in Hellas (for they had not\r\nenrolled themselves either in the Athenian or in the Lacedaemonian\r\nconfederacy), decided to repair to Athens in order to enter into\r\nalliance and to endeavour to procure support from her. Corinth also,\r\nhearing of their intentions, sent an embassy to Athens to prevent the\r\nCorcyraean navy being joined by the Athenian, and her prospect of\r\nordering the war according to her wishes being thus impeded. An\r\nassembly was convoked, and the rival advocates appeared: the\r\nCorcyraeans spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“Athenians! when a people that have not rendered any important service\r\nor support to their neighbours in times past, for which they might\r\nclaim to be repaid, appear before them as we now appear before you to\r\nsolicit their assistance, they may fairly be required to satisfy\r\ncertain preliminary conditions. They should show, first, that it is\r\nexpedient or at least safe to grant their request; next, that they will\r\nretain a lasting sense of the kindness. But if they cannot clearly\r\nestablish any of these points, they must not be annoyed if they meet\r\nwith a rebuff. Now the Corcyraeans believe that with their petition for\r\nassistance they can also give you a satisfactory answer on these\r\npoints, and they have therefore dispatched us hither. It has so\r\nhappened that our policy as regards you with respect to this request,\r\nturns out to be inconsistent, and as regards our interests, to be at\r\nthe present crisis inexpedient. We say inconsistent, because a power\r\nwhich has never in the whole of her past history been willing to ally\r\nherself with any of her neighbours, is now found asking them to ally\r\nthemselves with her. And we say inexpedient, because in our present war\r\nwith Corinth it has left us in a position of entire isolation, and what\r\nonce seemed the wise precaution of refusing to involve ourselves in\r\nalliances with other powers, lest we should also involve ourselves in\r\nrisks of their choosing, has now proved to be folly and weakness. It is\r\ntrue that in the late naval engagement we drove back the Corinthians\r\nfrom our shores single-handed. But they have now got together a still\r\nlarger armament from Peloponnese and the rest of Hellas; and we, seeing\r\nour utter inability to cope with them without foreign aid, and the\r\nmagnitude of the danger which subjection to them implies, find it\r\nnecessary to ask help from you and from every other power. And we hope\r\nto be excused if we forswear our old principle of complete political\r\nisolation, a principle which was not adopted with any sinister\r\nintention, but was rather the consequence of an error in judgment.\r\n\r\n“Now there are many reasons why in the event of your compliance you\r\nwill congratulate yourselves on this request having been made to you.\r\nFirst, because your assistance will be rendered to a power which,\r\nherself inoffensive, is a victim to the injustice of others. Secondly,\r\nbecause all that we most value is at stake in the present contest, and\r\nyour welcome of us under these circumstances will be a proof of\r\ngoodwill which will ever keep alive the gratitude you will lay up in\r\nour hearts. Thirdly, yourselves excepted, we are the greatest naval\r\npower in Hellas. Moreover, can you conceive a stroke of good fortune\r\nmore rare in itself, or more disheartening to your enemies, than that\r\nthe power whose adhesion you would have valued above much material and\r\nmoral strength should present herself self-invited, should deliver\r\nherself into your hands without danger and without expense, and should\r\nlastly put you in the way of gaining a high character in the eyes of\r\nthe world, the gratitude of those whom you shall assist, and a great\r\naccession of strength for yourselves? You may search all history\r\nwithout finding many instances of a people gaining all these advantages\r\nat once, or many instances of a power that comes in quest of assistance\r\nbeing in a position to give to the people whose alliance she solicits\r\nas much safety and honour as she will receive. But it will be urged\r\nthat it is only in the case of a war that we shall be found useful. To\r\nthis we answer that if any of you imagine that that war is far off, he\r\nis grievously mistaken, and is blind to the fact that Lacedaemon\r\nregards you with jealousy and desires war, and that Corinth is powerful\r\nthere—the same, remember, that is your enemy, and is even now trying to\r\nsubdue us as a preliminary to attacking you. And this she does to\r\nprevent our becoming united by a common enmity, and her having us both\r\non her hands, and also to ensure getting the start of you in one of two\r\nways, either by crippling our power or by making its strength her own.\r\nNow it is our policy to be beforehand with her—that is, for Corcyra to\r\nmake an offer of alliance and for you to accept it; in fact, we ought\r\nto form plans against her instead of waiting to defeat the plans she\r\nforms against us.\r\n\r\n“If she asserts that for you to receive a colony of hers into alliance\r\nis not right, let her know that every colony that is well treated\r\nhonours its parent state, but becomes estranged from it by injustice.\r\nFor colonists are not sent forth on the understanding that they are to\r\nbe the slaves of those that remain behind, but that they are to be\r\ntheir equals. And that Corinth was injuring us is clear. Invited to\r\nrefer the dispute about Epidamnus to arbitration, they chose to\r\nprosecute their complaints war rather than by a fair trial. And let\r\ntheir conduct towards us who are their kindred be a warning to you not\r\nto be misled by their deceit, nor to yield to their direct requests;\r\nconcessions to adversaries only end in self-reproach, and the more\r\nstrictly they are avoided the greater will be the chance of security.\r\n\r\n“If it be urged that your reception of us will be a breach of the\r\ntreaty existing between you and Lacedaemon, the answer is that we are a\r\nneutral state, and that one of the express provisions of that treaty is\r\nthat it shall be competent for any Hellenic state that is neutral to\r\njoin whichever side it pleases. And it is intolerable for Corinth to be\r\nallowed to obtain men for her navy not only from her allies, but also\r\nfrom the rest of Hellas, no small number being furnished by your own\r\nsubjects; while we are to be excluded both from the alliance left open\r\nto us by treaty, and from any assistance that we might get from other\r\nquarters, and you are to be accused of political immorality if you\r\ncomply with our request. On the other hand, we shall have much greater\r\ncause to complain of you, if you do not comply with it; if we, who are\r\nin peril and are no enemies of yours, meet with a repulse at your\r\nhands, while Corinth, who is the aggressor and your enemy, not only\r\nmeets with no hindrance from you, but is even allowed to draw material\r\nfor war from your dependencies. This ought not to be, but you should\r\neither forbid her enlisting men in your dominions, or you should lend\r\nus too what help you may think advisable.\r\n\r\n“But your real policy is to afford us avowed countenance and support.\r\nThe advantages of this course, as we premised in the beginning of our\r\nspeech, are many. We mention one that is perhaps the chief. Could there\r\nbe a clearer guarantee of our good faith than is offered by the fact\r\nthat the power which is at enmity with you is also at enmity with us,\r\nand that that power is fully able to punish defection? And there is a\r\nwide difference between declining the alliance of an inland and of a\r\nmaritime power. For your first endeavour should be to prevent, if\r\npossible, the existence of any naval power except your own; failing\r\nthis, to secure the friendship of the strongest that does exist. And if\r\nany of you believe that what we urge is expedient, but fear to act upon\r\nthis belief, lest it should lead to a breach of the treaty, you must\r\nremember that on the one hand, whatever your fears, your strength will\r\nbe formidable to your antagonists; on the other, whatever the\r\nconfidence you derive from refusing to receive us, your weakness will\r\nhave no terrors for a strong enemy. You must also remember that your\r\ndecision is for Athens no less than Corcyra, and that you are not\r\nmaking the best provision for her interests, if at a time when you are\r\nanxiously scanning the horizon that you may be in readiness for the\r\nbreaking out of the war which is all but upon you, you hesitate to\r\nattach to your side a place whose adhesion or estrangement is alike\r\npregnant with the most vital consequences. For it lies conveniently for\r\nthe coast-navigation in the direction of Italy and Sicily, being able\r\nto bar the passage of naval reinforcements from thence to Peloponnese,\r\nand from Peloponnese thither; and it is in other respects a most\r\ndesirable station. To sum up as shortly as possible, embracing both\r\ngeneral and particular considerations, let this show you the folly of\r\nsacrificing us. Remember that there are but three considerable naval\r\npowers in Hellas—Athens, Corcyra, and Corinth—and that if you allow two\r\nof these three to become one, and Corinth to secure us for herself, you\r\nwill have to hold the sea against the united fleets of Corcyra and\r\nPeloponnese. But if you receive us, you will have our ships to\r\nreinforce you in the struggle.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of the Corcyraeans. After they had finished, the\r\nCorinthians spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“These Corcyraeans in the speech we have just heard do not confine\r\nthemselves to the question of their reception into your alliance. They\r\nalso talk of our being guilty of injustice, and their being the victims\r\nof an unjustifiable war. It becomes necessary for us to touch upon both\r\nthese points before we proceed to the rest of what we have to say, that\r\nyou may have a more correct idea of the grounds of our claim, and have\r\ngood cause to reject their petition. According to them, their old\r\npolicy of refusing all offers of alliance was a policy of moderation.\r\nIt was in fact adopted for bad ends, not for good; indeed their conduct\r\nis such as to make them by no means desirous of having allies present\r\nto witness it, or of having the shame of asking their concurrence.\r\nBesides, their geographical situation makes them independent of others,\r\nand consequently the decision in cases where they injure any lies not\r\nwith judges appointed by mutual agreement, but with themselves,\r\nbecause, while they seldom make voyages to their neighbours, they are\r\nconstantly being visited by foreign vessels which are compelled to put\r\nin to Corcyra. In short, the object that they propose to themselves, in\r\ntheir specious policy of complete isolation, is not to avoid sharing in\r\nthe crimes of others, but to secure monopoly of crime to themselves—the\r\nlicence of outrage wherever they can compel, of fraud wherever they can\r\nelude, and the enjoyment of their gains without shame. And yet if they\r\nwere the honest men they pretend to be, the less hold that others had\r\nupon them, the stronger would be the light in which they might have put\r\ntheir honesty by giving and taking what was just.\r\n\r\n“But such has not been their conduct either towards others or towards\r\nus. The attitude of our colony towards us has always been one of\r\nestrangement and is now one of hostility; for, say they: ‘We were not\r\nsent out to be ill-treated.’ We rejoin that we did not found the colony\r\nto be insulted by them, but to be their head and to be regarded with a\r\nproper respect. At any rate our other colonies honour us, and we are\r\nmuch beloved by our colonists; and clearly, if the majority are\r\nsatisfied with us, these can have no good reason for a dissatisfaction\r\nin which they stand alone, and we are not acting improperly in making\r\nwar against them, nor are we making war against them without having\r\nreceived signal provocation. Besides, if we were in the wrong, it would\r\nbe honourable in them to give way to our wishes, and disgraceful for us\r\nto trample on their moderation; but in the pride and licence of wealth\r\nthey have sinned again and again against us, and never more deeply than\r\nwhen Epidamnus, our dependency, which they took no steps to claim in\r\nits distress upon our coming to relieve it, was by them seized, and is\r\nnow held by force of arms.\r\n\r\n“As to their allegation that they wished the question to be first\r\nsubmitted to arbitration, it is obvious that a challenge coming from\r\nthe party who is safe in a commanding position cannot gain the credit\r\ndue only to him who, before appealing to arms, in deeds as well as\r\nwords, places himself on a level with his adversary. In their case, it\r\nwas not before they laid siege to the place, but after they at length\r\nunderstood that we should not tamely suffer it, that they thought of\r\nthe specious word arbitration. And not satisfied with their own\r\nmisconduct there, they appear here now requiring you to join with them\r\nnot in alliance but in crime, and to receive them in spite of their\r\nbeing at enmity with us. But it was when they stood firmest that they\r\nshould have made overtures to you, and not at a time when we have been\r\nwronged and they are in peril; nor yet at a time when you will be\r\nadmitting to a share in your protection those who never admitted you to\r\na share in their power, and will be incurring an equal amount of blame\r\nfrom us with those in whose offences you had no hand. No, they should\r\nhave shared their power with you before they asked you to share your\r\nfortunes with them.\r\n\r\n“So then the reality of the grievances we come to complain of, and the\r\nviolence and rapacity of our opponents, have both been proved. But that\r\nyou cannot equitably receive them, this you have still to learn. It may\r\nbe true that one of the provisions of the treaty is that it shall be\r\ncompetent for any state, whose name was not down on the list, to join\r\nwhichever side it pleases. But this agreement is not meant for those\r\nwhose object in joining is the injury of other powers, but for those\r\nwhose need of support does not arise from the fact of defection, and\r\nwhose adhesion will not bring to the power that is mad enough to\r\nreceive them war instead of peace; which will be the case with you, if\r\nyou refuse to listen to us. For you cannot become their auxiliary and\r\nremain our friend; if you join in their attack, you must share the\r\npunishment which the defenders inflict on them. And yet you have the\r\nbest possible right to be neutral, or, failing this, you should on the\r\ncontrary join us against them. Corinth is at least in treaty with you;\r\nwith Corcyra you were never even in truce. But do not lay down the\r\nprinciple that defection is to be patronized. Did we on the defection\r\nof the Samians record our vote against you, when the rest of the\r\nPeloponnesian powers were equally divided on the question whether they\r\nshould assist them? No, we told them to their face that every power has\r\na right to punish its own allies. Why, if you make it your policy to\r\nreceive and assist all offenders, you will find that just as many of\r\nyour dependencies will come over to us, and the principle that you\r\nestablish will press less heavily on us than on yourselves.\r\n\r\n“This then is what Hellenic law entitles us to demand as a right. But\r\nwe have also advice to offer and claims on your gratitude, which, since\r\nthere is no danger of our injuring you, as we are not enemies, and\r\nsince our friendship does not amount to very frequent intercourse, we\r\nsay ought to be liquidated at the present juncture. When you were in\r\nwant of ships of war for the war against the Aeginetans, before the\r\nPersian invasion, Corinth supplied you with twenty vessels. That good\r\nturn, and the line we took on the Samian question, when we were the\r\ncause of the Peloponnesians refusing to assist them, enabled you to\r\nconquer Aegina and to punish Samos. And we acted thus at crises when,\r\nif ever, men are wont in their efforts against their enemies to forget\r\neverything for the sake of victory, regarding him who assists them then\r\nas a friend, even if thus far he has been a foe, and him who opposes\r\nthem then as a foe, even if he has thus far been a friend; indeed they\r\nallow their real interests to suffer from their absorbing preoccupation\r\nin the struggle.\r\n\r\n“Weigh well these considerations, and let your youth learn what they\r\nare from their elders, and let them determine to do unto us as we have\r\ndone unto you. And let them not acknowledge the justice of what we say,\r\nbut dispute its wisdom in the contingency of war. Not only is the\r\nstraightest path generally speaking the wisest; but the coming of the\r\nwar, which the Corcyraeans have used as a bugbear to persuade you to do\r\nwrong, is still uncertain, and it is not worth while to be carried away\r\nby it into gaining the instant and declared enmity of Corinth. It were,\r\nrather, wise to try and counteract the unfavourable impression which\r\nyour conduct to Megara has created. For kindness opportunely shown has\r\na greater power of removing old grievances than the facts of the case\r\nmay warrant. And do not be seduced by the prospect of a great naval\r\nalliance. Abstinence from all injustice to other first-rate powers is a\r\ngreater tower of strength than anything that can be gained by the\r\nsacrifice of permanent tranquillity for an apparent temporary\r\nadvantage. It is now our turn to benefit by the principle that we laid\r\ndown at Lacedaemon, that every power has a right to punish her own\r\nallies. We now claim to receive the same from you, and protest against\r\nyour rewarding us for benefiting you by our vote by injuring us by\r\nyours. On the contrary, return us like for like, remembering that this\r\nis that very crisis in which he who lends aid is most a friend, and he\r\nwho opposes is most a foe. And for these Corcyraeans—neither receive\r\nthem into alliance in our despite, nor be their abettors in crime. So\r\ndo, and you will act as we have a right to expect of you, and at the\r\nsame time best consult your own interests.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of the Corinthians.\r\n\r\nWhen the Athenians had heard both out, two assemblies were held. In the\r\nfirst there was a manifest disposition to listen to the representations\r\nof Corinth; in the second, public feeling had changed and an alliance\r\nwith Corcyra was decided on, with certain reservations. It was to be a\r\ndefensive, not an offensive alliance. It did not involve a breach of\r\nthe treaty with Peloponnese: Athens could not be required to join\r\nCorcyra in any attack upon Corinth. But each of the contracting parties\r\nhad a right to the other’s assistance against invasion, whether of his\r\nown territory or that of an ally. For it began now to be felt that the\r\ncoming of the Peloponnesian war was only a question of time, and no one\r\nwas willing to see a naval power of such magnitude as Corcyra\r\nsacrificed to Corinth; though if they could let them weaken each other\r\nby mutual conflict, it would be no bad preparation for the struggle\r\nwhich Athens might one day have to wage with Corinth and the other\r\nnaval powers. At the same time the island seemed to lie conveniently on\r\nthe coasting passage to Italy and Sicily. With these views, Athens\r\nreceived Corcyra into alliance and, on the departure of the Corinthians\r\nnot long afterwards, sent ten ships to their assistance. They were\r\ncommanded by Lacedaemonius, the son of Cimon, Diotimus, the son of\r\nStrombichus, and Proteas, the son of Epicles. Their instructions were\r\nto avoid collision with the Corinthian fleet except under certain\r\ncircumstances. If it sailed to Corcyra and threatened a landing on her\r\ncoast, or in any of her possessions, they were to do their utmost to\r\nprevent it. These instructions were prompted by an anxiety to avoid a\r\nbreach of the treaty.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Corinthians completed their preparations, and sailed for\r\nCorcyra with a hundred and fifty ships. Of these Elis furnished ten,\r\nMegara twelve, Leucas ten, Ambracia twenty-seven, Anactorium one, and\r\nCorinth herself ninety. Each of these contingents had its own admiral,\r\nthe Corinthian being under the command of Xenoclides, son of Euthycles,\r\nwith four colleagues. Sailing from Leucas, they made land at the part\r\nof the continent opposite Corcyra. They anchored in the harbour of\r\nChimerium, in the territory of Thesprotis, above which, at some\r\ndistance from the sea, lies the city of Ephyre, in the Elean district.\r\nBy this city the Acherusian lake pours its waters into the sea. It gets\r\nits name from the river Acheron, which flows through Thesprotis and\r\nfalls into the lake. There also the river Thyamis flows, forming the\r\nboundary between Thesprotis and Kestrine; and between these rivers\r\nrises the point of Chimerium. In this part of the continent the\r\nCorinthians now came to anchor, and formed an encampment. When the\r\nCorcyraeans saw them coming, they manned a hundred and ten ships,\r\ncommanded by Meikiades, Aisimides, and Eurybatus, and stationed\r\nthemselves at one of the Sybota isles; the ten Athenian ships being\r\npresent. On Point Leukimme they posted their land forces, and a\r\nthousand heavy infantry who had come from Zacynthus to their\r\nassistance. Nor were the Corinthians on the mainland without their\r\nallies. The barbarians flocked in large numbers to their assistance,\r\nthe inhabitants of this part of the continent being old allies of\r\ntheirs.\r\n\r\nWhen the Corinthian preparations were completed, they took three days’\r\nprovisions and put out from Chimerium by night, ready for action.\r\nSailing with the dawn, they sighted the Corcyraean fleet out at sea and\r\ncoming towards them. When they perceived each other, both sides formed\r\nin order of battle. On the Corcyraean right wing lay the Athenian\r\nships, the rest of the line being occupied by their own vessels formed\r\nin three squadrons, each of which was commanded by one of the three\r\nadmirals. Such was the Corcyraean formation. The Corinthian was as\r\nfollows: on the right wing lay the Megarian and Ambraciot ships, in the\r\ncentre the rest of the allies in order. But the left was composed of\r\nthe best sailers in the Corinthian navy, to encounter the Athenians and\r\nthe right wing of the Corcyraeans. As soon as the signals were raised\r\non either side, they joined battle. Both sides had a large number of\r\nheavy infantry on their decks, and a large number of archers and\r\ndarters, the old imperfect armament still prevailing. The sea-fight was\r\nan obstinate one, though not remarkable for its science; indeed it was\r\nmore like a battle by land. Whenever they charged each other, the\r\nmultitude and crush of the vessels made it by no means easy to get\r\nloose; besides, their hopes of victory lay principally in the heavy\r\ninfantry on the decks, who stood and fought in order, the ships\r\nremaining stationary. The manoeuvre of breaking the line was not tried;\r\nin short, strength and pluck had more share in the fight than science.\r\nEverywhere tumult reigned, the battle being one scene of confusion;\r\nmeanwhile the Athenian ships, by coming up to the Corcyraeans whenever\r\nthey were pressed, served to alarm the enemy, though their commanders\r\ncould not join in the battle from fear of their instructions. The right\r\nwing of the Corinthians suffered most. The Corcyraeans routed it, and\r\nchased them in disorder to the continent with twenty ships, sailed up\r\nto their camp, and burnt the tents which they found empty, and\r\nplundered the stuff. So in this quarter the Corinthians and their\r\nallies were defeated, and the Corcyraeans were victorious. But where\r\nthe Corinthians themselves were, on the left, they gained a decided\r\nsuccess; the scanty forces of the Corcyraeans being further weakened by\r\nthe want of the twenty ships absent on the pursuit. Seeing the\r\nCorcyraeans hard pressed, the Athenians began at length to assist them\r\nmore unequivocally. At first, it is true, they refrained from charging\r\nany ships; but when the rout was becoming patent, and the Corinthians\r\nwere pressing on, the time at last came when every one set to, and all\r\ndistinction was laid aside, and it came to this point, that the\r\nCorinthians and Athenians raised their hands against each other.\r\n\r\nAfter the rout, the Corinthians, instead of employing themselves in\r\nlashing fast and hauling after them the hulls of the vessels which they\r\nhad disabled, turned their attention to the men, whom they butchered as\r\nthey sailed through, not caring so much to make prisoners. Some even of\r\ntheir own friends were slain by them, by mistake, in their ignorance of\r\nthe defeat of the right wing For the number of the ships on both sides,\r\nand the distance to which they covered the sea, made it difficult,\r\nafter they had once joined, to distinguish between the conquering and\r\nthe conquered; this battle proving far greater than any before it, any\r\nat least between Hellenes, for the number of vessels engaged. After the\r\nCorinthians had chased the Corcyraeans to the land, they turned to the\r\nwrecks and their dead, most of whom they succeeded in getting hold of\r\nand conveying to Sybota, the rendezvous of the land forces furnished by\r\ntheir barbarian allies. Sybota, it must be known, is a desert harbour\r\nof Thesprotis. This task over, they mustered anew, and sailed against\r\nthe Corcyraeans, who on their part advanced to meet them with all their\r\nships that were fit for service and remaining to them, accompanied by\r\nthe Athenian vessels, fearing that they might attempt a landing in\r\ntheir territory. It was by this time getting late, and the paean had\r\nbeen sung for the attack, when the Corinthians suddenly began to back\r\nwater. They had observed twenty Athenian ships sailing up, which had\r\nbeen sent out afterwards to reinforce the ten vessels by the Athenians,\r\nwho feared, as it turned out justly, the defeat of the Corcyraeans and\r\nthe inability of their handful of ships to protect them. These ships\r\nwere thus seen by the Corinthians first. They suspected that they were\r\nfrom Athens, and that those which they saw were not all, but that there\r\nwere more behind; they accordingly began to retire. The Corcyraeans\r\nmeanwhile had not sighted them, as they were advancing from a point\r\nwhich they could not so well see, and were wondering why the\r\nCorinthians were backing water, when some caught sight of them, and\r\ncried out that there were ships in sight ahead. Upon this they also\r\nretired; for it was now getting dark, and the retreat of the\r\nCorinthians had suspended hostilities. Thus they parted from each\r\nother, and the battle ceased with night. The Corcyraeans were in their\r\ncamp at Leukimme, when these twenty ships from Athens, under the\r\ncommand of Glaucon, the son of Leagrus, and Andocides, son of Leogoras,\r\nbore on through the corpses and the wrecks, and sailed up to the camp,\r\nnot long after they were sighted. It was now night, and the Corcyraeans\r\nfeared that they might be hostile vessels; but they soon knew them, and\r\nthe ships came to anchor.\r\n\r\nThe next day the thirty Athenian vessels put out to sea, accompanied by\r\nall the Corcyraean ships that were seaworthy, and sailed to the harbour\r\nat Sybota, where the Corinthians lay, to see if they would engage. The\r\nCorinthians put out from the land and formed a line in the open sea,\r\nbut beyond this made no further movement, having no intention of\r\nassuming the offensive. For they saw reinforcements arrived fresh from\r\nAthens, and themselves confronted by numerous difficulties, such as the\r\nnecessity of guarding the prisoners whom they had on board and the want\r\nof all means of refitting their ships in a desert place. What they were\r\nthinking more about was how their voyage home was to be effected; they\r\nfeared that the Athenians might consider that the treaty was dissolved\r\nby the collision which had occurred, and forbid their departure.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they resolved to put some men on board a boat, and send\r\nthem without a herald’s wand to the Athenians, as an experiment. Having\r\ndone so, they spoke as follows: “You do wrong, Athenians, to begin war\r\nand break the treaty. Engaged in chastising our enemies, we find you\r\nplacing yourselves in our path in arms against us. Now if your\r\nintentions are to prevent us sailing to Corcyra, or anywhere else that\r\nwe may wish, and if you are for breaking the treaty, first take us that\r\nare here and treat us as enemies.” Such was what they said, and all the\r\nCorcyraean armament that were within hearing immediately called out to\r\ntake them and kill them. But the Athenians answered as follows:\r\n“Neither are we beginning war, Peloponnesians, nor are we breaking the\r\ntreaty; but these Corcyraeans are our allies, and we are come to help\r\nthem. So if you want to sail anywhere else, we place no obstacle in\r\nyour way; but if you are going to sail against Corcyra, or any of her\r\npossessions, we shall do our best to stop you.”\r\n\r\nReceiving this answer from the Athenians, the Corinthians commenced\r\npreparations for their voyage home, and set up a trophy in Sybota, on\r\nthe continent; while the Corcyraeans took up the wrecks and dead that\r\nhad been carried out to them by the current, and by a wind which rose\r\nin the night and scattered them in all directions, and set up their\r\ntrophy in Sybota, on the island, as victors. The reasons each side had\r\nfor claiming the victory were these. The Corinthians had been\r\nvictorious in the sea-fight until night; and having thus been enabled\r\nto carry off most wrecks and dead, they were in possession of no fewer\r\nthan a thousand prisoners of war, and had sunk close upon seventy\r\nvessels. The Corcyraeans had destroyed about thirty ships, and after\r\nthe arrival of the Athenians had taken up the wrecks and dead on their\r\nside; they had besides seen the Corinthians retire before them, backing\r\nwater on sight of the Athenian vessels, and upon the arrival of the\r\nAthenians refuse to sail out against them from Sybota. Thus both sides\r\nclaimed the victory.\r\n\r\nThe Corinthians on the voyage home took Anactorium, which stands at the\r\nmouth of the Ambracian gulf. The place was taken by treachery, being\r\ncommon ground to the Corcyraeans and Corinthians. After establishing\r\nCorinthian settlers there, they retired home. Eight hundred of the\r\nCorcyraeans were slaves; these they sold; two hundred and fifty they\r\nretained in captivity, and treated with great attention, in the hope\r\nthat they might bring over their country to Corinth on their return;\r\nmost of them being, as it happened, men of very high position in\r\nCorcyra. In this way Corcyra maintained her political existence in the\r\nwar with Corinth, and the Athenian vessels left the island. This was\r\nthe first cause of the war that Corinth had against the Athenians,\r\nviz., that they had fought against them with the Corcyraeans in time of\r\ntreaty.\r\n\r\nAlmost immediately after this, fresh differences arose between the\r\nAthenians and Peloponnesians, and contributed their share to the war.\r\nCorinth was forming schemes for retaliation, and Athens suspected her\r\nhostility. The Potidæans, who inhabit the isthmus of Pallene, being a\r\nCorinthian colony, but tributary allies of Athens, were ordered to raze\r\nthe wall looking towards Pallene, to give hostages, to dismiss the\r\nCorinthian magistrates, and in future not to receive the persons sent\r\nfrom Corinth annually to succeed them. It was feared that they might be\r\npersuaded by Perdiccas and the Corinthians to revolt, and might draw\r\nthe rest of the allies in the direction of Thrace to revolt with them.\r\nThese precautions against the Potidæans were taken by the Athenians\r\nimmediately after the battle at Corcyra. Not only was Corinth at length\r\nopenly hostile, but Perdiccas, son of Alexander, king of the\r\nMacedonians, had from an old friend and ally been made an enemy. He had\r\nbeen made an enemy by the Athenians entering into alliance with his\r\nbrother Philip and Derdas, who were in league against him. In his alarm\r\nhe had sent to Lacedaemon to try and involve the Athenians in a war\r\nwith the Peloponnesians, and was endeavouring to win over Corinth in\r\norder to bring about the revolt of Potidæa. He also made overtures to\r\nthe Chalcidians in the direction of Thrace, and to the Bottiaeans, to\r\npersuade them to join in the revolt; for he thought that if these\r\nplaces on the border could be made his allies, it would be easier to\r\ncarry on the war with their co-operation. Alive to all this, and\r\nwishing to anticipate the revolt of the cities, the Athenians acted as\r\nfollows. They were just then sending off thirty ships and a thousand\r\nheavy infantry for his country under the command of Archestratus, son\r\nof Lycomedes, with four colleagues. They instructed the captains to\r\ntake hostages of the Potidæans, to raze the wall, and to be on their\r\nguard against the revolt of the neighbouring cities.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Potidæans sent envoys to Athens on the chance of\r\npersuading them to take no new steps in their matters; they also went\r\nto Lacedaemon with the Corinthians to secure support in case of need.\r\nFailing after prolonged negotiation to obtain anything satisfactory\r\nfrom the Athenians; being unable, for all they could say, to prevent\r\nthe vessels that were destined for Macedonia from also sailing against\r\nthem; and receiving from the Lacedaemonian government a promise to\r\ninvade Attica, if the Athenians should attack Potidæa, the Potidæans,\r\nthus favoured by the moment, at last entered into league with the\r\nChalcidians and Bottiaeans, and revolted. And Perdiccas induced the\r\nChalcidians to abandon and demolish their towns on the seaboard and,\r\nsettling inland at Olynthus, to make that one city a strong place:\r\nmeanwhile to those who followed his advice he gave a part of his\r\nterritory in Mygdonia round Lake Bolbe as a place of abode while the\r\nwar against the Athenians should last. They accordingly demolished\r\ntheir towns, removed inland and prepared for war. The thirty ships of\r\nthe Athenians, arriving before the Thracian places, found Potidæa and\r\nthe rest in revolt. Their commanders, considering it to be quite\r\nimpossible with their present force to carry on war with Perdiccas and\r\nwith the confederate towns as well turned to Macedonia, their original\r\ndestination, and, having established themselves there, carried on war\r\nin co-operation with Philip, and the brothers of Derdas, who had\r\ninvaded the country from the interior.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Corinthians, with Potidæa in revolt and the Athenian\r\nships on the coast of Macedonia, alarmed for the safety of the place\r\nand thinking its danger theirs, sent volunteers from Corinth, and\r\nmercenaries from the rest of Peloponnese, to the number of sixteen\r\nhundred heavy infantry in all, and four hundred light troops. Aristeus,\r\nson of Adimantus, who was always a steady friend to the Potidæans, took\r\ncommand of the expedition, and it was principally for love of him that\r\nmost of the men from Corinth volunteered. They arrived in Thrace forty\r\ndays after the revolt of Potidæa.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians also immediately received the news of the revolt of the\r\ncities. On being informed that Aristeus and his reinforcements were on\r\ntheir way, they sent two thousand heavy infantry of their own citizens\r\nand forty ships against the places in revolt, under the command of\r\nCallias, son of Calliades, and four colleagues. They arrived in\r\nMacedonia first, and found the force of a thousand men that had been\r\nfirst sent out, just become masters of Therme and besieging Pydna.\r\nAccordingly they also joined in the investment, and besieged Pydna for\r\na while. Subsequently they came to terms and concluded a forced\r\nalliance with Perdiccas, hastened by the calls of Potidæa and by the\r\narrival of Aristeus at that place. They withdrew from Macedonia, going\r\nto Beroea and thence to Strepsa, and, after a futile attempt on the\r\nlatter place, they pursued by land their march to Potidæa with three\r\nthousand heavy infantry of their own citizens, besides a number of\r\ntheir allies, and six hundred Macedonian horsemen, the followers of\r\nPhilip and Pausanias. With these sailed seventy ships along the coast.\r\nAdvancing by short marches, on the third day they arrived at Gigonus,\r\nwhere they encamped.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Potidæans and the Peloponnesians with Aristeus were\r\nencamped on the side looking towards Olynthus on the isthmus, in\r\nexpectation of the Athenians, and had established their market outside\r\nthe city. The allies had chosen Aristeus general of all the infantry;\r\nwhile the command of the cavalry was given to Perdiccas, who had at\r\nonce left the alliance of the Athenians and gone back to that of the\r\nPotidæans, having deputed Iolaus as his general: The plan of Aristeus\r\nwas to keep his own force on the isthmus, and await the attack of the\r\nAthenians; leaving the Chalcidians and the allies outside the isthmus,\r\nand the two hundred cavalry from Perdiccas in Olynthus to act upon the\r\nAthenian rear, on the occasion of their advancing against him; and thus\r\nto place the enemy between two fires. While Callias the Athenian\r\ngeneral and his colleagues dispatched the Macedonian horse and a few of\r\nthe allies to Olynthus, to prevent any movement being made from that\r\nquarter, the Athenians themselves broke up their camp and marched\r\nagainst Potidæa. After they had arrived at the isthmus, and saw the\r\nenemy preparing for battle, they formed against him, and soon\r\nafterwards engaged. The wing of Aristeus, with the Corinthians and\r\nother picked troops round him, routed the wing opposed to it, and\r\nfollowed for a considerable distance in pursuit. But the rest of the\r\narmy of the Potidæans and of the Peloponnesians was defeated by the\r\nAthenians, and took refuge within the fortifications. Returning from\r\nthe pursuit, Aristeus perceived the defeat of the rest of the army.\r\nBeing at a loss which of the two risks to choose, whether to go to\r\nOlynthus or to Potidæa, he at last determined to draw his men into as\r\nsmall a space as possible, and force his way with a run into Potidæa.\r\nNot without difficulty, through a storm of missiles, he passed along by\r\nthe breakwater through the sea, and brought off most of his men safe,\r\nthough a few were lost. Meanwhile the auxiliaries of the Potidæans from\r\nOlynthus, which is about seven miles off and in sight of Potidæa, when\r\nthe battle began and the signals were raised, advanced a little way to\r\nrender assistance; and the Macedonian horse formed against them to\r\nprevent it. But on victory speedily declaring for the Athenians and the\r\nsignals being taken down, they retired back within the wall; and the\r\nMacedonians returned to the Athenians. Thus there were no cavalry\r\npresent on either side. After the battle the Athenians set up a trophy,\r\nand gave back their dead to the Potidæans under truce. The Potidæans\r\nand their allies had close upon three hundred killed; the Athenians a\r\nhundred and fifty of their own citizens, and Callias their general.\r\n\r\nThe wall on the side of the isthmus had now works at once raised\r\nagainst it, and manned by the Athenians. That on the side of Pallene\r\nhad no works raised against it. They did not think themselves strong\r\nenough at once to keep a garrison in the isthmus and to cross over to\r\nPallene and raise works there; they were afraid that the Potidæans and\r\ntheir allies might take advantage of their division to attack them.\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians at home learning that there were no works at\r\nPallene, some time afterwards sent off sixteen hundred heavy infantry\r\nof their own citizens under the command of Phormio, son of Asopius.\r\nArrived at Pallene, he fixed his headquarters at Aphytis, and led his\r\narmy against Potidæa by short marches, ravaging the country as he\r\nadvanced. No one venturing to meet him in the field, he raised works\r\nagainst the wall on the side of Pallene. So at length Potidæa was\r\nstrongly invested on either side, and from the sea by the ships\r\nco-operating in the blockade. Aristeus, seeing its investment complete,\r\nand having no hope of its salvation, except in the event of some\r\nmovement from the Peloponnese, or of some other improbable contingency,\r\nadvised all except five hundred to watch for a wind and sail out of the\r\nplace, in order that their provisions might last the longer. He was\r\nwilling to be himself one of those who remained. Unable to persuade\r\nthem, and desirous of acting on the next alternative, and of having\r\nthings outside in the best posture possible, he eluded the guardships\r\nof the Athenians and sailed out. Remaining among the Chalcidians, he\r\ncontinued to carry on the war; in particular he laid an ambuscade near\r\nthe city of the Sermylians, and cut off many of them; he also\r\ncommunicated with Peloponnese, and tried to contrive some method by\r\nwhich help might be brought. Meanwhile, after the completion of the\r\ninvestment of Potidæa, Phormio next employed his sixteen hundred men in\r\nravaging Chalcidice and Bottica: some of the towns also were taken by\r\nhim.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n\r\nCongress of the Peloponnesian Confederacy at Lacedaemon\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Athenians and Peloponnesians had these antecedent grounds of\r\ncomplaint against each other: the complaint of Corinth was that her\r\ncolony of Potidæa, and Corinthian and Peloponnesian citizens within it,\r\nwere being besieged; that of Athens against the Peloponnesians that\r\nthey had incited a town of hers, a member of her alliance and a\r\ncontributor to her revenue, to revolt, and had come and were openly\r\nfighting against her on the side of the Potidæans. For all this, war\r\nhad not yet broken out: there was still truce for a while; for this was\r\na private enterprise on the part of Corinth.\r\n\r\nBut the siege of Potidæa put an end to her inaction; she had men inside\r\nit: besides, she feared for the place. Immediately summoning the allies\r\nto Lacedaemon, she came and loudly accused Athens of breach of the\r\ntreaty and aggression on the rights of Peloponnese. With her, the\r\nAeginetans, formally unrepresented from fear of Athens, in secret\r\nproved not the least urgent of the advocates for war, asserting that\r\nthey had not the independence guaranteed to them by the treaty. After\r\nextending the summons to any of their allies and others who might have\r\ncomplaints to make of Athenian aggression, the Lacedaemonians held\r\ntheir ordinary assembly, and invited them to speak. There were many who\r\ncame forward and made their several accusations; among them the\r\nMegarians, in a long list of grievances, called special attention to\r\nthe fact of their exclusion from the ports of the Athenian empire and\r\nthe market of Athens, in defiance of the treaty. Last of all the\r\nCorinthians came forward, and having let those who preceded them\r\ninflame the Lacedaemonians, now followed with a speech to this effect:\r\n\r\n“Lacedaemonians! the confidence which you feel in your constitution and\r\nsocial order, inclines you to receive any reflections of ours on other\r\npowers with a certain scepticism. Hence springs your moderation, but\r\nhence also the rather limited knowledge which you betray in dealing\r\nwith foreign politics. Time after time was our voice raised to warn you\r\nof the blows about to be dealt us by Athens, and time after time,\r\ninstead of taking the trouble to ascertain the worth of our\r\ncommunications, you contented yourselves with suspecting the speakers\r\nof being inspired by private interest. And so, instead of calling these\r\nallies together before the blow fell, you have delayed to do so till we\r\nare smarting under it; allies among whom we have not the worst title to\r\nspeak, as having the greatest complaints to make, complaints of\r\nAthenian outrage and Lacedaemonian neglect. Now if these assaults on\r\nthe rights of Hellas had been made in the dark, you might be\r\nunacquainted with the facts, and it would be our duty to enlighten you.\r\nAs it is, long speeches are not needed where you see servitude\r\naccomplished for some of us, meditated for others—in particular for our\r\nallies—and prolonged preparations in the aggressor against the hour of\r\nwar. Or what, pray, is the meaning of their reception of Corcyra by\r\nfraud, and their holding it against us by force? what of the siege of\r\nPotidæa?—places one of which lies most conveniently for any action\r\nagainst the Thracian towns; while the other would have contributed a\r\nvery large navy to the Peloponnesians?\r\n\r\n“For all this you are responsible. You it was who first allowed them to\r\nfortify their city after the Median war, and afterwards to erect the\r\nlong walls—you who, then and now, are always depriving of freedom not\r\nonly those whom they have enslaved, but also those who have as yet been\r\nyour allies. For the true author of the subjugation of a people is not\r\nso much the immediate agent, as the power which permits it having the\r\nmeans to prevent it; particularly if that power aspires to the glory of\r\nbeing the liberator of Hellas. We are at last assembled. It has not\r\nbeen easy to assemble, nor even now are our objects defined. We ought\r\nnot to be still inquiring into the fact of our wrongs, but into the\r\nmeans of our defence. For the aggressors with matured plans to oppose\r\nto our indecision have cast threats aside and betaken themselves to\r\naction. And we know what are the paths by which Athenian aggression\r\ntravels, and how insidious is its progress. A degree of confidence she\r\nmay feel from the idea that your bluntness of perception prevents your\r\nnoticing her; but it is nothing to the impulse which her advance will\r\nreceive from the knowledge that you see, but do not care to interfere.\r\nYou, Lacedaemonians, of all the Hellenes are alone inactive, and defend\r\nyourselves not by doing anything but by looking as if you would do\r\nsomething; you alone wait till the power of an enemy is becoming twice\r\nits original size, instead of crushing it in its infancy. And yet the\r\nworld used to say that you were to be depended upon; but in your case,\r\nwe fear, it said more than the truth. The Mede, we ourselves know, had\r\ntime to come from the ends of the earth to Peloponnese, without any\r\nforce of yours worthy of the name advancing to meet him. But this was a\r\ndistant enemy. Well, Athens at all events is a near neighbour, and yet\r\nAthens you utterly disregard; against Athens you prefer to act on the\r\ndefensive instead of on the offensive, and to make it an affair of\r\nchances by deferring the struggle till she has grown far stronger than\r\nat first. And yet you know that on the whole the rock on which the\r\nbarbarian was wrecked was himself, and that if our present enemy Athens\r\nhas not again and again annihilated us, we owe it more to her blunders\r\nthan to your protection; Indeed, expectations from you have before now\r\nbeen the ruin of some, whose faith induced them to omit preparation.\r\n\r\n“We hope that none of you will consider these words of remonstrance to\r\nbe rather words of hostility; men remonstrate with friends who are in\r\nerror, accusations they reserve for enemies who have wronged them.\r\nBesides, we consider that we have as good a right as any one to point\r\nout a neighbour’s faults, particularly when we contemplate the great\r\ncontrast between the two national characters; a contrast of which, as\r\nfar as we can see, you have little perception, having never yet\r\nconsidered what sort of antagonists you will encounter in the\r\nAthenians, how widely, how absolutely different from yourselves. The\r\nAthenians are addicted to innovation, and their designs are\r\ncharacterized by swiftness alike in conception and execution; you have\r\na genius for keeping what you have got, accompanied by a total want of\r\ninvention, and when forced to act you never go far enough. Again, they\r\nare adventurous beyond their power, and daring beyond their judgment,\r\nand in danger they are sanguine; your wont is to attempt less than is\r\njustified by your power, to mistrust even what is sanctioned by your\r\njudgment, and to fancy that from danger there is no release. Further,\r\nthere is promptitude on their side against procrastination on yours;\r\nthey are never at home, you are never from it: for they hope by their\r\nabsence to extend their acquisitions, you fear by your advance to\r\nendanger what you have left behind. They are swift to follow up a\r\nsuccess, and slow to recoil from a reverse. Their bodies they spend\r\nungrudgingly in their country’s cause; their intellect they jealously\r\nhusband to be employed in her service. A scheme unexecuted is with them\r\na positive loss, a successful enterprise a comparative failure. The\r\ndeficiency created by the miscarriage of an undertaking is soon filled\r\nup by fresh hopes; for they alone are enabled to call a thing hoped for\r\na thing got, by the speed with which they act upon their resolutions.\r\nThus they toil on in trouble and danger all the days of their life,\r\nwith little opportunity for enjoying, being ever engaged in getting:\r\ntheir only idea of a holiday is to do what the occasion demands, and to\r\nthem laborious occupation is less of a misfortune than the peace of a\r\nquiet life. To describe their character in a word, one might truly say\r\nthat they were born into the world to take no rest themselves and to\r\ngive none to others.\r\n\r\n“Such is Athens, your antagonist. And yet, Lacedaemonians, you still\r\ndelay, and fail to see that peace stays longest with those, who are not\r\nmore careful to use their power justly than to show their determination\r\nnot to submit to injustice. On the contrary, your ideal of fair dealing\r\nis based on the principle that, if you do not injure others, you need\r\nnot risk your own fortunes in preventing others from injuring you. Now\r\nyou could scarcely have succeeded in such a policy even with a\r\nneighbour like yourselves; but in the present instance, as we have just\r\nshown, your habits are old-fashioned as compared with theirs. It is the\r\nlaw as in art, so in politics, that improvements ever prevail; and\r\nthough fixed usages may be best for undisturbed communities, constant\r\nnecessities of action must be accompanied by the constant improvement\r\nof methods. Thus it happens that the vast experience of Athens has\r\ncarried her further than you on the path of innovation.\r\n\r\n“Here, at least, let your procrastination end. For the present, assist\r\nyour allies and Potidæa in particular, as you promised, by a speedy\r\ninvasion of Attica, and do not sacrifice friends and kindred to their\r\nbitterest enemies, and drive the rest of us in despair to some other\r\nalliance. Such a step would not be condemned either by the Gods who\r\nreceived our oaths, or by the men who witnessed them. The breach of a\r\ntreaty cannot be laid to the people whom desertion compels to seek new\r\nrelations, but to the power that fails to assist its confederate. But\r\nif you will only act, we will stand by you; it would be unnatural for\r\nus to change, and never should we meet with such a congenial ally. For\r\nthese reasons choose the right course, and endeavour not to let\r\nPeloponnese under your supremacy degenerate from the prestige that it\r\nenjoyed under that of your ancestors.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of the Corinthians. There happened to be Athenian\r\nenvoys present at Lacedaemon on other business. On hearing the speeches\r\nthey thought themselves called upon to come before the Lacedaemonians.\r\nTheir intention was not to offer a defence on any of the charges which\r\nthe cities brought against them, but to show on a comprehensive view\r\nthat it was not a matter to be hastily decided on, but one that\r\ndemanded further consideration. There was also a wish to call attention\r\nto the great power of Athens, and to refresh the memory of the old and\r\nenlighten the ignorance of the young, from a notion that their words\r\nmight have the effect of inducing them to prefer tranquillity to war.\r\nSo they came to the Lacedaemonians and said that they too, if there was\r\nno objection, wished to speak to their assembly. They replied by\r\ninviting them to come forward. The Athenians advanced, and spoke as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“The object of our mission here was not to argue with your allies, but\r\nto attend to the matters on which our state dispatched us. However, the\r\nvehemence of the outcry that we hear against us has prevailed on us to\r\ncome forward. It is not to combat the accusations of the cities (indeed\r\nyou are not the judges before whom either we or they can plead), but to\r\nprevent your taking the wrong course on matters of great importance by\r\nyielding too readily to the persuasions of your allies. We also wish to\r\nshow on a review of the whole indictment that we have a fair title to\r\nour possessions, and that our country has claims to consideration. We\r\nneed not refer to remote antiquity: there we could appeal to the voice\r\nof tradition, but not to the experience of our audience. But to the\r\nMedian War and contemporary history we must refer, although we are\r\nrather tired of continually bringing this subject forward. In our\r\naction during that war we ran great risk to obtain certain advantages:\r\nyou had your share in the solid results, do not try to rob us of all\r\nshare in the good that the glory may do us. However, the story shall be\r\ntold not so much to deprecate hostility as to testify against it, and\r\nto show, if you are so ill advised as to enter into a struggle with\r\nAthens, what sort of an antagonist she is likely to prove. We assert\r\nthat at Marathon we were at the front, and faced the barbarian\r\nsingle-handed. That when he came the second time, unable to cope with\r\nhim by land we went on board our ships with all our people, and joined\r\nin the action at Salamis. This prevented his taking the Peloponnesian\r\nstates in detail, and ravaging them with his fleet; when the multitude\r\nof his vessels would have made any combination for self-defence\r\nimpossible. The best proof of this was furnished by the invader\r\nhimself. Defeated at sea, he considered his power to be no longer what\r\nit had been, and retired as speedily as possible with the greater part\r\nof his army.\r\n\r\n“Such, then, was the result of the matter, and it was clearly proved\r\nthat it was on the fleet of Hellas that her cause depended. Well, to\r\nthis result we contributed three very useful elements, viz., the\r\nlargest number of ships, the ablest commander, and the most\r\nunhesitating patriotism. Our contingent of ships was little less than\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole four hundred; the commander was Themistocles,\r\nthrough whom chiefly it was that the battle took place in the straits,\r\nthe acknowledged salvation of our cause. Indeed, this was the reason of\r\nyour receiving him with honours such as had never been accorded to any\r\nforeign visitor. While for daring patriotism we had no competitors.\r\nReceiving no reinforcements from behind, seeing everything in front of\r\nus already subjugated, we had the spirit, after abandoning our city,\r\nafter sacrificing our property (instead of deserting the remainder of\r\nthe league or depriving them of our services by dispersing), to throw\r\nourselves into our ships and meet the danger, without a thought of\r\nresenting your neglect to assist us. We assert, therefore, that we\r\nconferred on you quite as much as we received. For you had a stake to\r\nfight for; the cities which you had left were still filled with your\r\nhomes, and you had the prospect of enjoying them again; and your coming\r\nwas prompted quite as much by fear for yourselves as for us; at all\r\nevents, you never appeared till we had nothing left to lose. But we\r\nleft behind us a city that was a city no longer, and staked our lives\r\nfor a city that had an existence only in desperate hope, and so bore\r\nour full share in your deliverance and in ours. But if we had copied\r\nothers, and allowed fears for our territory to make us give in our\r\nadhesion to the Mede before you came, or if we had suffered our ruin to\r\nbreak our spirit and prevent us embarking in our ships, your naval\r\ninferiority would have made a sea-fight unnecessary, and his objects\r\nwould have been peaceably attained.\r\n\r\n“Surely, Lacedaemonians, neither by the patriotism that we displayed at\r\nthat crisis, nor by the wisdom of our counsels, do we merit our extreme\r\nunpopularity with the Hellenes, not at least unpopularity for our\r\nempire. That empire we acquired by no violent means, but because you\r\nwere unwilling to prosecute to its conclusion the war against the\r\nbarbarian, and because the allies attached themselves to us and\r\nspontaneously asked us to assume the command. And the nature of the\r\ncase first compelled us to advance our empire to its present height;\r\nfear being our principal motive, though honour and interest afterwards\r\ncame in. And at last, when almost all hated us, when some had already\r\nrevolted and had been subdued, when you had ceased to be the friends\r\nthat you once were, and had become objects of suspicion and dislike, it\r\nappeared no longer safe to give up our empire; especially as all who\r\nleft us would fall to you. And no one can quarrel with a people for\r\nmaking, in matters of tremendous risk, the best provision that it can\r\nfor its interest.\r\n\r\n“You, at all events, Lacedaemonians, have used your supremacy to settle\r\nthe states in Peloponnese as is agreeable to you. And if at the period\r\nof which we were speaking you had persevered to the end of the matter,\r\nand had incurred hatred in your command, we are sure that you would\r\nhave made yourselves just as galling to the allies, and would have been\r\nforced to choose between a strong government and danger to yourselves.\r\nIt follows that it was not a very wonderful action, or contrary to the\r\ncommon practice of mankind, if we did accept an empire that was offered\r\nto us, and refused to give it up under the pressure of three of the\r\nstrongest motives, fear, honour, and interest. And it was not we who\r\nset the example, for it has always been law that the weaker should be\r\nsubject to the stronger. Besides, we believed ourselves to be worthy of\r\nour position, and so you thought us till now, when calculations of\r\ninterest have made you take up the cry of justice—a consideration which\r\nno one ever yet brought forward to hinder his ambition when he had a\r\nchance of gaining anything by might. And praise is due to all who, if\r\nnot so superior to human nature as to refuse dominion, yet respect\r\njustice more than their position compels them to do.\r\n\r\n“We imagine that our moderation would be best demonstrated by the\r\nconduct of others who should be placed in our position; but even our\r\nequity has very unreasonably subjected us to condemnation instead of\r\napproval. Our abatement of our rights in the contract trials with our\r\nallies, and our causing them to be decided by impartial laws at Athens,\r\nhave gained us the character of being litigious. And none care to\r\ninquire why this reproach is not brought against other imperial powers,\r\nwho treat their subjects with less moderation than we do; the secret\r\nbeing that where force can be used, law is not needed. But our subjects\r\nare so habituated to associate with us as equals that any defeat\r\nwhatever that clashes with their notions of justice, whether it\r\nproceeds from a legal judgment or from the power which our empire gives\r\nus, makes them forget to be grateful for being allowed to retain most\r\nof their possessions, and more vexed at a part being taken, than if we\r\nhad from the first cast law aside and openly gratified our\r\ncovetousness. If we had done so, not even would they have disputed that\r\nthe weaker must give way to the stronger. Men’s indignation, it seems,\r\nis more excited by legal wrong than by violent wrong; the first looks\r\nlike being cheated by an equal, the second like being compelled by a\r\nsuperior. At all events they contrived to put up with much worse\r\ntreatment than this from the Mede, yet they think our rule severe, and\r\nthis is to be expected, for the present always weighs heavy on the\r\nconquered. This at least is certain. If you were to succeed in\r\noverthrowing us and in taking our place, you would speedily lose the\r\npopularity with which fear of us has invested you, if your policy of\r\nto-day is at all to tally with the sample that you gave of it during\r\nthe brief period of your command against the Mede. Not only is your\r\nlife at home regulated by rules and institutions incompatible with\r\nthose of others, but your citizens abroad act neither on these rules\r\nnor on those which are recognized by the rest of Hellas.\r\n\r\n“Take time then in forming your resolution, as the matter is of great\r\nimportance; and do not be persuaded by the opinions and complaints of\r\nothers to bring trouble on yourselves, but consider the vast influence\r\nof accident in war, before you are engaged in it. As it continues, it\r\ngenerally becomes an affair of chances, chances from which neither of\r\nus is exempt, and whose event we must risk in the dark. It is a common\r\nmistake in going to war to begin at the wrong end, to act first, and\r\nwait for disaster to discuss the matter. But we are not yet by any\r\nmeans so misguided, nor, so far as we can see, are you; accordingly,\r\nwhile it is still open to us both to choose aright, we bid you not to\r\ndissolve the treaty, or to break your oaths, but to have our\r\ndifferences settled by arbitration according to our agreement. Or else\r\nwe take the gods who heard the oaths to witness, and if you begin\r\nhostilities, whatever line of action you choose, we will try not to be\r\nbehindhand in repelling you.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of the Athenians. After the Lacedaemonians had\r\nheard the complaints of the allies against the Athenians, and the\r\nobservations of the latter, they made all withdraw, and consulted by\r\nthemselves on the question before them. The opinions of the majority\r\nall led to the same conclusion; the Athenians were open aggressors, and\r\nwar must be declared at once. But Archidamus, the Lacedaemonian king,\r\ncame forward, who had the reputation of being at once a wise and a\r\nmoderate man, and made the following speech:\r\n\r\n“I have not lived so long, Lacedaemonians, without having had the\r\nexperience of many wars, and I see those among you of the same age as\r\nmyself, who will not fall into the common misfortune of longing for war\r\nfrom inexperience or from a belief in its advantage and its safety.\r\nThis, the war on which you are now debating, would be one of the\r\ngreatest magnitude, on a sober consideration of the matter. In a\r\nstruggle with Peloponnesians and neighbours our strength is of the same\r\ncharacter, and it is possible to move swiftly on the different points.\r\nBut a struggle with a people who live in a distant land, who have also\r\nan extraordinary familiarity with the sea, and who are in the highest\r\nstate of preparation in every other department; with wealth private and\r\npublic, with ships, and horses, and heavy infantry, and a population\r\nsuch as no one other Hellenic place can equal, and lastly a number of\r\ntributary allies—what can justify us in rashly beginning such a\r\nstruggle? wherein is our trust that we should rush on it unprepared? Is\r\nit in our ships? There we are inferior; while if we are to practise and\r\nbecome a match for them, time must intervene. Is it in our money? There\r\nwe have a far greater deficiency. We neither have it in our treasury,\r\nnor are we ready to contribute it from our private funds. Confidence\r\nmight possibly be felt in our superiority in heavy infantry and\r\npopulation, which will enable us to invade and devastate their lands.\r\nBut the Athenians have plenty of other land in their empire, and can\r\nimport what they want by sea. Again, if we are to attempt an\r\ninsurrection of their allies, these will have to be supported with a\r\nfleet, most of them being islanders. What then is to be our war? For\r\nunless we can either beat them at sea, or deprive them of the revenues\r\nwhich feed their navy, we shall meet with little but disaster.\r\nMeanwhile our honour will be pledged to keeping on, particularly if it\r\nbe the opinion that we began the quarrel. For let us never be elated by\r\nthe fatal hope of the war being quickly ended by the devastation of\r\ntheir lands. I fear rather that we may leave it as a legacy to our\r\nchildren; so improbable is it that the Athenian spirit will be the\r\nslave of their land, or Athenian experience be cowed by war.\r\n\r\n“Not that I would bid you be so unfeeling as to suffer them to injure\r\nyour allies, and to refrain from unmasking their intrigues; but I do\r\nbid you not to take up arms at once, but to send and remonstrate with\r\nthem in a tone not too suggestive of war, nor again too suggestive of\r\nsubmission, and to employ the interval in perfecting our own\r\npreparations. The means will be, first, the acquisition of allies,\r\nHellenic or barbarian it matters not, so long as they are an accession\r\nto our strength naval or pecuniary—I say Hellenic or barbarian, because\r\nthe odium of such an accession to all who like us are the objects of\r\nthe designs of the Athenians is taken away by the law of\r\nself-preservation—and secondly the development of our home resources.\r\nIf they listen to our embassy, so much the better; but if not, after\r\nthe lapse of two or three years our position will have become\r\nmaterially strengthened, and we can then attack them if we think\r\nproper. Perhaps by that time the sight of our preparations, backed by\r\nlanguage equally significant, will have disposed them to submission,\r\nwhile their land is still untouched, and while their counsels may be\r\ndirected to the retention of advantages as yet undestroyed. For the\r\nonly light in which you can view their land is that of a hostage in\r\nyour hands, a hostage the more valuable the better it is cultivated.\r\nThis you ought to spare as long as possible, and not make them\r\ndesperate, and so increase the difficulty of dealing with them. For if\r\nwhile still unprepared, hurried away by the complaints of our allies,\r\nwe are induced to lay it waste, have a care that we do not bring deep\r\ndisgrace and deep perplexity upon Peloponnese. Complaints, whether of\r\ncommunities or individuals, it is possible to adjust; but war\r\nundertaken by a coalition for sectional interests, whose progress there\r\nis no means of foreseeing, does not easily admit of creditable\r\nsettlement.\r\n\r\n“And none need think it cowardice for a number of confederates to pause\r\nbefore they attack a single city. The Athenians have allies as numerous\r\nas our own, and allies that pay tribute, and war is a matter not so\r\nmuch of arms as of money, which makes arms of use. And this is more\r\nthan ever true in a struggle between a continental and a maritime\r\npower. First, then, let us provide money, and not allow ourselves to be\r\ncarried away by the talk of our allies before we have done so: as we\r\nshall have the largest share of responsibility for the consequences be\r\nthey good or bad, we have also a right to a tranquil inquiry respecting\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“And the slowness and procrastination, the parts of our character that\r\nare most assailed by their criticism, need not make you blush. If we\r\nundertake the war without preparation, we should by hastening its\r\ncommencement only delay its conclusion: further, a free and a famous\r\ncity has through all time been ours. The quality which they condemn is\r\nreally nothing but a wise moderation; thanks to its possession, we\r\nalone do not become insolent in success and give way less than others\r\nin misfortune; we are not carried away by the pleasure of hearing\r\nourselves cheered on to risks which our judgment condemns; nor, if\r\nannoyed, are we any the more convinced by attempts to exasperate us by\r\naccusation. We are both warlike and wise, and it is our sense of order\r\nthat makes us so. We are warlike, because self-control contains honour\r\nas a chief constituent, and honour bravery. And we are wise, because we\r\nare educated with too little learning to despise the laws, and with too\r\nsevere a self-control to disobey them, and are brought up not to be too\r\nknowing in useless matters—such as the knowledge which can give a\r\nspecious criticism of an enemy’s plans in theory, but fails to assail\r\nthem with equal success in practice—but are taught to consider that the\r\nschemes of our enemies are not dissimilar to our own, and that the\r\nfreaks of chance are not determinable by calculation. In practice we\r\nalways base our preparations against an enemy on the assumption that\r\nhis plans are good; indeed, it is right to rest our hopes not on a\r\nbelief in his blunders, but on the soundness of our provisions. Nor\r\nought we to believe that there is much difference between man and man,\r\nbut to think that the superiority lies with him who is reared in the\r\nseverest school. These practices, then, which our ancestors have\r\ndelivered to us, and by whose maintenance we have always profited, must\r\nnot be given up. And we must not be hurried into deciding in a day’s\r\nbrief space a question which concerns many lives and fortunes and many\r\ncities, and in which honour is deeply involved—but we must decide\r\ncalmly. This our strength peculiarly enables us to do. As for the\r\nAthenians, send to them on the matter of Potidæa, send on the matter of\r\nthe alleged wrongs of the allies, particularly as they are prepared\r\nwith legal satisfaction; and to proceed against one who offers\r\narbitration as against a wrongdoer, law forbids. Meanwhile do not omit\r\npreparation for war. This decision will be the best for yourselves, the\r\nmost terrible to your opponents.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Archidamus. Last came forward Sthenelaidas, one\r\nof the ephors for that year, and spoke to the Lacedaemonians as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n“The long speech of the Athenians I do not pretend to understand. They\r\nsaid a good deal in praise of themselves, but nowhere denied that they\r\nare injuring our allies and Peloponnese. And yet if they behaved well\r\nagainst the Mede then, but ill towards us now, they deserve double\r\npunishment for having ceased to be good and for having become bad. We\r\nmeanwhile are the same then and now, and shall not, if we are wise,\r\ndisregard the wrongs of our allies, or put off till to-morrow the duty\r\nof assisting those who must suffer to-day. Others have much money and\r\nships and horses, but we have good allies whom we must not give up to\r\nthe Athenians, nor by lawsuits and words decide the matter, as it is\r\nanything but in word that we are harmed, but render instant and\r\npowerful help. And let us not be told that it is fitting for us to\r\ndeliberate under injustice; long deliberation is rather fitting for\r\nthose who have injustice in contemplation. Vote therefore,\r\nLacedaemonians, for war, as the honour of Sparta demands, and neither\r\nallow the further aggrandizement of Athens, nor betray our allies to\r\nruin, but with the gods let us advance against the aggressors.”\r\n\r\nWith these words he, as ephor, himself put the question to the assembly\r\nof the Lacedaemonians. He said that he could not determine which was\r\nthe loudest acclamation (their mode of decision is by acclamation not\r\nby voting); the fact being that he wished to make them declare their\r\nopinion openly and thus to increase their ardour for war. Accordingly\r\nhe said: “All Lacedaemonians who are of opinion that the treaty has\r\nbeen broken, and that Athens is guilty, leave your seats and go there,”\r\npointing out a certain place; “all who are of the opposite opinion,\r\nthere.” They accordingly stood up and divided; and those who held that\r\nthe treaty had been broken were in a decided majority. Summoning the\r\nallies, they told them that their opinion was that Athens had been\r\nguilty of injustice, but that they wished to convoke all the allies and\r\nput it to the vote; in order that they might make war, if they decided\r\nto do so, on a common resolution. Having thus gained their point, the\r\ndelegates returned home at once; the Athenian envoys a little later,\r\nwhen they had dispatched the objects of their mission. This decision of\r\nthe assembly, judging that the treaty had been broken, was made in the\r\nfourteenth year of the thirty years’ truce, which was entered into\r\nafter the affair of Euboea.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians voted that the treaty had been broken, and that the\r\nwar must be declared, not so much because they were persuaded by the\r\narguments of the allies, as because they feared the growth of the power\r\nof the Athenians, seeing most of Hellas already subject to them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the end of the Persian to the beginning of the Peloponnesian\r\nWar—The Progress from Supremacy to Empire\r\n\r\n\r\nThe way in which Athens came to be placed in the circumstances under\r\nwhich her power grew was this. After the Medes had returned from\r\nEurope, defeated by sea and land by the Hellenes, and after those of\r\nthem who had fled with their ships to Mycale had been destroyed,\r\nLeotychides, king of the Lacedaemonians, the commander of the Hellenes\r\nat Mycale, departed home with the allies from Peloponnese. But the\r\nAthenians and the allies from Ionia and Hellespont, who had now\r\nrevolted from the King, remained and laid siege to Sestos, which was\r\nstill held by the Medes. After wintering before it, they became masters\r\nof the place on its evacuation by the barbarians; and after this they\r\nsailed away from Hellespont to their respective cities. Meanwhile the\r\nAthenian people, after the departure of the barbarian from their\r\ncountry, at once proceeded to carry over their children and wives, and\r\nsuch property as they had left, from the places where they had\r\ndeposited them, and prepared to rebuild their city and their walls. For\r\nonly isolated portions of the circumference had been left standing, and\r\nmost of the houses were in ruins; though a few remained, in which the\r\nPersian grandees had taken up their quarters.\r\n\r\nPerceiving what they were going to do, the Lacedaemonians sent an\r\nembassy to Athens. They would have themselves preferred to see neither\r\nher nor any other city in possession of a wall; though here they acted\r\nprincipally at the instigation of their allies, who were alarmed at the\r\nstrength of her newly acquired navy and the valour which she had\r\ndisplayed in the war with the Medes. They begged her not only to\r\nabstain from building walls for herself, but also to join them in\r\nthrowing down the walls that still held together of the\r\nultra-Peloponnesian cities. The real meaning of their advice, the\r\nsuspicion that it contained against the Athenians, was not proclaimed;\r\nit was urged that so the barbarian, in the event of a third invasion,\r\nwould not have any strong place, such as he now had in Thebes, for his\r\nbase of operations; and that Peloponnese would suffice for all as a\r\nbase both for retreat and offence. After the Lacedaemonians had thus\r\nspoken, they were, on the advice of Themistocles, immediately dismissed\r\nby the Athenians, with the answer that ambassadors should be sent to\r\nSparta to discuss the question. Themistocles told the Athenians to send\r\nhim off with all speed to Lacedaemon, but not to dispatch his\r\ncolleagues as soon as they had selected them, but to wait until they\r\nhad raised their wall to the height from which defence was possible.\r\nMeanwhile the whole population in the city was to labour at the wall,\r\nthe Athenians, their wives, and their children, sparing no edifice,\r\nprivate or public, which might be of any use to the work, but throwing\r\nall down. After giving these instructions, and adding that he would be\r\nresponsible for all other matters there, he departed. Arrived at\r\nLacedaemon he did not seek an audience with the authorities, but tried\r\nto gain time and made excuses. When any of the government asked him why\r\nhe did not appear in the assembly, he would say that he was waiting for\r\nhis colleagues, who had been detained in Athens by some engagement;\r\nhowever, that he expected their speedy arrival, and wondered that they\r\nwere not yet there. At first the Lacedaemonians trusted the words of\r\nThemistocles, through their friendship for him; but when others\r\narrived, all distinctly declaring that the work was going on and\r\nalready attaining some elevation, they did not know how to disbelieve\r\nit. Aware of this, he told them that rumours are deceptive, and should\r\nnot be trusted; they should send some reputable persons from Sparta to\r\ninspect, whose report might be trusted. They dispatched them\r\naccordingly. Concerning these Themistocles secretly sent word to the\r\nAthenians to detain them as far as possible without putting them under\r\nopen constraint, and not to let them go until they had themselves\r\nreturned. For his colleagues had now joined him, Abronichus, son of\r\nLysicles, and Aristides, son of Lysimachus, with the news that the wall\r\nwas sufficiently advanced; and he feared that when the Lacedaemonians\r\nheard the facts, they might refuse to let them go. So the Athenians\r\ndetained the envoys according to his message, and Themistocles had an\r\naudience with the Lacedaemonians, and at last openly told them that\r\nAthens was now fortified sufficiently to protect its inhabitants; that\r\nany embassy which the Lacedaemonians or their allies might wish to send\r\nto them should in future proceed on the assumption that the people to\r\nwhom they were going was able to distinguish both its own and the\r\ngeneral interests. That when the Athenians thought fit to abandon their\r\ncity and to embark in their ships, they ventured on that perilous step\r\nwithout consulting them; and that on the other hand, wherever they had\r\ndeliberated with the Lacedaemonians, they had proved themselves to be\r\nin judgment second to none. That they now thought it fit that their\r\ncity should have a wall, and that this would be more for the advantage\r\nof both the citizens of Athens and the Hellenic confederacy; for\r\nwithout equal military strength it was impossible to contribute equal\r\nor fair counsel to the common interest. It followed, he observed,\r\neither that all the members of the confederacy should be without walls,\r\nor that the present step should be considered a right one.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians did not betray any open signs of anger against the\r\nAthenians at what they heard. The embassy, it seems, was prompted not\r\nby a desire to obstruct, but to guide the counsels of their government:\r\nbesides, Spartan feeling was at that time very friendly towards Athens\r\non account of the patriotism which she had displayed in the struggle\r\nwith the Mede. Still the defeat of their wishes could not but cause\r\nthem secret annoyance. The envoys of each state departed home without\r\ncomplaint.\r\n\r\nIn this way the Athenians walled their city in a little while. To this\r\nday the building shows signs of the haste of its execution; the\r\nfoundations are laid of stones of all kinds, and in some places not\r\nwrought or fitted, but placed just in the order in which they were\r\nbrought by the different hands; and many columns, too, from tombs, and\r\nsculptured stones were put in with the rest. For the bounds of the city\r\nwere extended at every point of the circumference; and so they laid\r\nhands on everything without exception in their haste. Themistocles also\r\npersuaded them to finish the walls of Piraeus, which had been begun\r\nbefore, in his year of office as archon; being influenced alike by the\r\nfineness of a locality that has three natural harbours, and by the\r\ngreat start which the Athenians would gain in the acquisition of power\r\nby becoming a naval people. For he first ventured to tell them to stick\r\nto the sea and forthwith began to lay the foundations of the empire. It\r\nwas by his advice, too, that they built the walls of that thickness\r\nwhich can still be discerned round Piraeus, the stones being brought up\r\nby two wagons meeting each other. Between the walls thus formed there\r\nwas neither rubble nor mortar, but great stones hewn square and fitted\r\ntogether, cramped to each other on the outside with iron and lead.\r\nAbout half the height that he intended was finished. His idea was by\r\ntheir size and thickness to keep off the attacks of an enemy; he\r\nthought that they might be adequately defended by a small garrison of\r\ninvalids, and the rest be freed for service in the fleet. For the fleet\r\nclaimed most of his attention. He saw, as I think, that the approach by\r\nsea was easier for the king’s army than that by land: he also thought\r\nPiraeus more valuable than the upper city; indeed, he was always\r\nadvising the Athenians, if a day should come when they were hard\r\npressed by land, to go down into Piraeus, and defy the world with their\r\nfleet. Thus, therefore, the Athenians completed their wall, and\r\ncommenced their other buildings immediately after the retreat of the\r\nMede.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Pausanias, son of Cleombrotus, was sent out from Lacedaemon\r\nas commander-in-chief of the Hellenes, with twenty ships from\r\nPeloponnese. With him sailed the Athenians with thirty ships, and a\r\nnumber of the other allies. They made an expedition against Cyprus and\r\nsubdued most of the island, and afterwards against Byzantium, which was\r\nin the hands of the Medes, and compelled it to surrender. This event\r\ntook place while the Spartans were still supreme. But the violence of\r\nPausanias had already begun to be disagreeable to the Hellenes,\r\nparticularly to the Ionians and the newly liberated populations. These\r\nresorted to the Athenians and requested them as their kinsmen to become\r\ntheir leaders, and to stop any attempt at violence on the part of\r\nPausanias. The Athenians accepted their overtures, and determined to\r\nput down any attempt of the kind and to settle everything else as their\r\ninterests might seem to demand. In the meantime the Lacedaemonians\r\nrecalled Pausanias for an investigation of the reports which had\r\nreached them. Manifold and grave accusations had been brought against\r\nhim by Hellenes arriving in Sparta; and, to all appearance, there had\r\nbeen in him more of the mimicry of a despot than of the attitude of a\r\ngeneral. As it happened, his recall came just at the time when the\r\nhatred which he had inspired had induced the allies to desert him, the\r\nsoldiers from Peloponnese excepted, and to range themselves by the side\r\nof the Athenians. On his arrival at Lacedaemon, he was censured for his\r\nprivate acts of oppression, but was acquitted on the heaviest counts\r\nand pronounced not guilty; it must be known that the charge of Medism\r\nformed one of the principal, and to all appearance one of the best\r\nfounded, articles against him. The Lacedaemonians did not, however,\r\nrestore him to his command, but sent out Dorkis and certain others with\r\na small force; who found the allies no longer inclined to concede to\r\nthem the supremacy. Perceiving this they departed, and the\r\nLacedaemonians did not send out any to succeed them. They feared for\r\nthose who went out a deterioration similar to that observable in\r\nPausanias; besides, they desired to be rid of the Median War, and were\r\nsatisfied of the competency of the Athenians for the position, and of\r\ntheir friendship at the time towards themselves.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, having thus succeeded to the supremacy by the voluntary\r\nact of the allies through their hatred of Pausanias, fixed which cities\r\nwere to contribute money against the barbarian, which ships; their\r\nprofessed object being to retaliate for their sufferings by ravaging\r\nthe King’s country. Now was the time that the office of “Treasurers for\r\nHellas” was first instituted by the Athenians. These officers received\r\nthe tribute, as the money contributed was called. The tribute was first\r\nfixed at four hundred and sixty talents. The common treasury was at\r\nDelos, and the congresses were held in the temple. Their supremacy\r\ncommenced with independent allies who acted on the resolutions of a\r\ncommon congress. It was marked by the following undertakings in war and\r\nin administration during the interval between the Median and the\r\npresent war, against the barbarian, against their own rebel allies, and\r\nagainst the Peloponnesian powers which would come in contact with them\r\non various occasions. My excuse for relating these events, and for\r\nventuring on this digression, is that this passage of history has been\r\nomitted by all my predecessors, who have confined themselves either to\r\nHellenic history before the Median War, or the Median War itself.\r\nHellanicus, it is true, did touch on these events in his Athenian\r\nhistory; but he is somewhat concise and not accurate in his dates.\r\nBesides, the history of these events contains an explanation of the\r\ngrowth of the Athenian empire.\r\n\r\nFirst the Athenians besieged and captured Eion on the Strymon from the\r\nMedes, and made slaves of the inhabitants, being under the command of\r\nCimon, son of Miltiades. Next they enslaved Scyros, the island in the\r\nAegean, containing a Dolopian population, and colonized it themselves.\r\nThis was followed by a war against Carystus, in which the rest of\r\nEuboea remained neutral, and which was ended by surrender on\r\nconditions. After this Naxos left the confederacy, and a war ensued,\r\nand she had to return after a siege; this was the first instance of the\r\nengagement being broken by the subjugation of an allied city, a\r\nprecedent which was followed by that of the rest in the order which\r\ncircumstances prescribed. Of all the causes of defection, that\r\nconnected with arrears of tribute and vessels, and with failure of\r\nservice, was the chief; for the Athenians were very severe and\r\nexacting, and made themselves offensive by applying the screw of\r\nnecessity to men who were not used to and in fact not disposed for any\r\ncontinuous labour. In some other respects the Athenians were not the\r\nold popular rulers they had been at first; and if they had more than\r\ntheir fair share of service, it was correspondingly easy for them to\r\nreduce any that tried to leave the confederacy. For this the allies had\r\nthemselves to blame; the wish to get off service making most of them\r\narrange to pay their share of the expense in money instead of in ships,\r\nand so to avoid having to leave their homes. Thus while Athens was\r\nincreasing her navy with the funds which they contributed, a revolt\r\nalways found them without resources or experience for war.\r\n\r\nNext we come to the actions by land and by sea at the river Eurymedon,\r\nbetween the Athenians with their allies, and the Medes, when the\r\nAthenians won both battles on the same day under the conduct of Cimon,\r\nson of Miltiades, and captured and destroyed the whole Phoenician\r\nfleet, consisting of two hundred vessels. Some time afterwards occurred\r\nthe defection of the Thasians, caused by disagreements about the marts\r\non the opposite coast of Thrace, and about the mine in their\r\npossession. Sailing with a fleet to Thasos, the Athenians defeated them\r\nat sea and effected a landing on the island. About the same time they\r\nsent ten thousand settlers of their own citizens and the allies to\r\nsettle the place then called Ennea Hodoi or Nine Ways, now Amphipolis.\r\nThey succeeded in gaining possession of Ennea Hodoi from the Edonians,\r\nbut on advancing into the interior of Thrace were cut off in Drabescus,\r\na town of the Edonians, by the assembled Thracians, who regarded the\r\nsettlement of the place Ennea Hodoi as an act of hostility. Meanwhile\r\nthe Thasians being defeated in the field and suffering siege, appealed\r\nto Lacedaemon, and desired her to assist them by an invasion of Attica.\r\nWithout informing Athens, she promised and intended to do so, but was\r\nprevented by the occurrence of the earthquake, accompanied by the\r\nsecession of the Helots and the Thuriats and Aethaeans of the Perioeci\r\nto Ithome. Most of the Helots were the descendants of the old\r\nMessenians that were enslaved in the famous war; and so all of them\r\ncame to be called Messenians. So the Lacedaemonians being engaged in a\r\nwar with the rebels in Ithome, the Thasians in the third year of the\r\nsiege obtained terms from the Athenians by razing their walls,\r\ndelivering up their ships, and arranging to pay the moneys demanded at\r\nonce, and tribute in future; giving up their possessions on the\r\ncontinent together with the mine.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians, meanwhile, finding the war against the rebels in\r\nIthome likely to last, invoked the aid of their allies, and especially\r\nof the Athenians, who came in some force under the command of Cimon.\r\nThe reason for this pressing summons lay in their reputed skill in\r\nsiege operations; a long siege had taught the Lacedaemonians their own\r\ndeficiency in this art, else they would have taken the place by\r\nassault. The first open quarrel between the Lacedaemonians and\r\nAthenians arose out of this expedition. The Lacedaemonians, when\r\nassault failed to take the place, apprehensive of the enterprising and\r\nrevolutionary character of the Athenians, and further looking upon them\r\nas of alien extraction, began to fear that, if they remained, they\r\nmight be tempted by the besieged in Ithome to attempt some political\r\nchanges. They accordingly dismissed them alone of the allies, without\r\ndeclaring their suspicions, but merely saying that they had now no need\r\nof them. But the Athenians, aware that their dismissal did not proceed\r\nfrom the more honourable reason of the two, but from suspicions which\r\nhad been conceived, went away deeply offended, and conscious of having\r\ndone nothing to merit such treatment from the Lacedaemonians; and the\r\ninstant that they returned home they broke off the alliance which had\r\nbeen made against the Mede, and allied themselves with Sparta’s enemy\r\nArgos; each of the contracting parties taking the same oaths and making\r\nthe same alliance with the Thessalians.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the rebels in Ithome, unable to prolong further a ten years’\r\nresistance, surrendered to Lacedaemon; the conditions being that they\r\nshould depart from Peloponnese under safe conduct, and should never set\r\nfoot in it again: any one who might hereafter be found there was to be\r\nthe slave of his captor. It must be known that the Lacedaemonians had\r\nan old oracle from Delphi, to the effect that they should let go the\r\nsuppliant of Zeus at Ithome. So they went forth with their children and\r\ntheir wives, and being received by Athens from the hatred that she now\r\nfelt for the Lacedaemonians, were located at Naupactus, which she had\r\nlately taken from the Ozolian Locrians. The Athenians received another\r\naddition to their confederacy in the Megarians; who left the\r\nLacedaemonian alliance, annoyed by a war about boundaries forced on\r\nthem by Corinth. The Athenians occupied Megara and Pegae, and built the\r\nMegarians their long walls from the city to Nisaea, in which they\r\nplaced an Athenian garrison. This was the principal cause of the\r\nCorinthians conceiving such a deadly hatred against Athens.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Inaros, son of Psammetichus, a Libyan king of the Libyans on\r\nthe Egyptian border, having his headquarters at Marea, the town above\r\nPharos, caused a revolt of almost the whole of Egypt from King\r\nArtaxerxes and, placing himself at its head, invited the Athenians to\r\nhis assistance. Abandoning a Cyprian expedition upon which they\r\nhappened to be engaged with two hundred ships of their own and their\r\nallies, they arrived in Egypt and sailed from the sea into the Nile,\r\nand making themselves masters of the river and two-thirds of Memphis,\r\naddressed themselves to the attack of the remaining third, which is\r\ncalled White Castle. Within it were Persians and Medes who had taken\r\nrefuge there, and Egyptians who had not joined the rebellion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians, making a descent from their fleet upon Haliae,\r\nwere engaged by a force of Corinthians and Epidaurians; and the\r\nCorinthians were victorious. Afterwards the Athenians engaged the\r\nPeloponnesian fleet off Cecruphalia; and the Athenians were victorious.\r\nSubsequently war broke out between Aegina and Athens, and there was a\r\ngreat battle at sea off Aegina between the Athenians and Aeginetans,\r\neach being aided by their allies; in which victory remained with the\r\nAthenians, who took seventy of the enemy’s ships, and landed in the\r\ncountry and commenced a siege under the command of Leocrates, son of\r\nStroebus. Upon this the Peloponnesians, desirous of aiding the\r\nAeginetans, threw into Aegina a force of three hundred heavy infantry,\r\nwho had before been serving with the Corinthians and Epidaurians.\r\nMeanwhile the Corinthians and their allies occupied the heights of\r\nGeraneia, and marched down into the Megarid, in the belief that, with a\r\nlarge force absent in Aegina and Egypt, Athens would be unable to help\r\nthe Megarians without raising the siege of Aegina. But the Athenians,\r\ninstead of moving the army of Aegina, raised a force of the old and\r\nyoung men that had been left in the city, and marched into the Megarid\r\nunder the command of Myronides. After a drawn battle with the\r\nCorinthians, the rival hosts parted, each with the impression that they\r\nhad gained the victory. The Athenians, however, if anything, had rather\r\nthe advantage, and on the departure of the Corinthians set up a trophy.\r\nUrged by the taunts of the elders in their city, the Corinthians made\r\ntheir preparations, and about twelve days afterwards came and set up\r\ntheir trophy as victors. Sallying out from Megara, the Athenians cut\r\noff the party that was employed in erecting the trophy, and engaged and\r\ndefeated the rest. In the retreat of the vanquished army, a\r\nconsiderable division, pressed by the pursuers and mistaking the road,\r\ndashed into a field on some private property, with a deep trench all\r\nround it, and no way out. Being acquainted with the place, the\r\nAthenians hemmed their front with heavy infantry and, placing the light\r\ntroops round in a circle, stoned all who had gone in. Corinth here\r\nsuffered a severe blow. The bulk of her army continued its retreat\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Athenians began to build the long walls to the sea,\r\nthat towards Phalerum and that towards Piraeus. Meanwhile the Phocians\r\nmade an expedition against Doris, the old home of the Lacedaemonians,\r\ncontaining the towns of Boeum, Kitinium, and Erineum. They had taken\r\none of these towns, when the Lacedaemonians under Nicomedes, son of\r\nCleombrotus, commanding for King Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, who was\r\nstill a minor, came to the aid of the Dorians with fifteen hundred\r\nheavy infantry of their own, and ten thousand of their allies. After\r\ncompelling the Phocians to restore the town on conditions, they began\r\ntheir retreat. The route by sea, across the Crissaean Gulf, exposed\r\nthem to the risk of being stopped by the Athenian fleet; that across\r\nGeraneia seemed scarcely safe, the Athenians holding Megara and Pegae.\r\nFor the pass was a difficult one, and was always guarded by the\r\nAthenians; and, in the present instance, the Lacedaemonians had\r\ninformation that they meant to dispute their passage. So they resolved\r\nto remain in Boeotia, and to consider which would be the safest line of\r\nmarch. They had also another reason for this resolve. Secret\r\nencouragement had been given them by a party in Athens, who hoped to\r\nput an end to the reign of democracy and the building of the Long\r\nWalls. Meanwhile the Athenians marched against them with their whole\r\nlevy and a thousand Argives and the respective contingents of the rest\r\nof their allies. Altogether they were fourteen thousand strong. The\r\nmarch was prompted by the notion that the Lacedaemonians were at a loss\r\nhow to effect their passage, and also by suspicions of an attempt to\r\noverthrow the democracy. Some cavalry also joined the Athenians from\r\ntheir Thessalian allies; but these went over to the Lacedaemonians\r\nduring the battle.\r\n\r\nThe battle was fought at Tanagra in Boeotia. After heavy loss on both\r\nsides, victory declared for the Lacedaemonians and their allies. After\r\nentering the Megarid and cutting down the fruit trees, the\r\nLacedaemonians returned home across Geraneia and the isthmus. Sixty-two\r\ndays after the battle the Athenians marched into Boeotia under the\r\ncommand of Myronides, defeated the Boeotians in battle at Oenophyta,\r\nand became masters of Boeotia and Phocis. They dismantled the walls of\r\nthe Tanagraeans, took a hundred of the richest men of the Opuntian\r\nLocrians as hostages, and finished their own long walls. This was\r\nfollowed by the surrender of the Aeginetans to Athens on conditions;\r\nthey pulled down their walls, gave up their ships, and agreed to pay\r\ntribute in future. The Athenians sailed round Peloponnese under\r\nTolmides, son of Tolmaeus, burnt the arsenal of Lacedaemon, took\r\nChalcis, a town of the Corinthians, and in a descent upon Sicyon\r\ndefeated the Sicyonians in battle.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians in Egypt and their allies were still there, and\r\nencountered all the vicissitudes of war. First the Athenians were\r\nmasters of Egypt, and the King sent Megabazus a Persian to Lacedaemon\r\nwith money to bribe the Peloponnesians to invade Attica and so draw off\r\nthe Athenians from Egypt. Finding that the matter made no progress, and\r\nthat the money was only being wasted, he recalled Megabazus with the\r\nremainder of the money, and sent Megabuzus, son of Zopyrus, a Persian,\r\nwith a large army to Egypt. Arriving by land he defeated the Egyptians\r\nand their allies in a battle, and drove the Hellenes out of Memphis,\r\nand at length shut them up in the island of Prosopitis, where he\r\nbesieged them for a year and six months. At last, draining the canal of\r\nits waters, which he diverted into another channel, he left their ships\r\nhigh and dry and joined most of the island to the mainland, and then\r\nmarched over on foot and captured it. Thus the enterprise of the\r\nHellenes came to ruin after six years of war. Of all that large host a\r\nfew travelling through Libya reached Cyrene in safety, but most of them\r\nperished. And thus Egypt returned to its subjection to the King, except\r\nAmyrtaeus, the king in the marshes, whom they were unable to capture\r\nfrom the extent of the marsh; the marshmen being also the most warlike\r\nof the Egyptians. Inaros, the Libyan king, the sole author of the\r\nEgyptian revolt, was betrayed, taken, and crucified. Meanwhile a\r\nrelieving squadron of fifty vessels had sailed from Athens and the rest\r\nof the confederacy for Egypt. They put in to shore at the Mendesian\r\nmouth of the Nile, in total ignorance of what had occurred. Attacked on\r\nthe land side by the troops, and from the sea by the Phoenician navy,\r\nmost of the ships were destroyed; the few remaining being saved by\r\nretreat. Such was the end of the great expedition of the Athenians and\r\ntheir allies to Egypt.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Orestes, son of Echecratidas, the Thessalian king, being an\r\nexile from Thessaly, persuaded the Athenians to restore him. Taking\r\nwith them the Boeotians and Phocians their allies, the Athenians\r\nmarched to Pharsalus in Thessaly. They became masters of the country,\r\nthough only in the immediate vicinity of the camp; beyond which they\r\ncould not go for fear of the Thessalian cavalry. But they failed to\r\ntake the city or to attain any of the other objects of their\r\nexpedition, and returned home with Orestes without having effected\r\nanything. Not long after this a thousand of the Athenians embarked in\r\nthe vessels that were at Pegae (Pegae, it must be remembered, was now\r\ntheirs), and sailed along the coast to Sicyon under the command of\r\nPericles, son of Xanthippus. Landing in Sicyon and defeating the\r\nSicyonians who engaged them, they immediately took with them the\r\nAchaeans and, sailing across, marched against and laid siege to\r\nOeniadae in Acarnania. Failing however to take it, they returned home.\r\n\r\nThree years afterwards a truce was made between the Peloponnesians and\r\nAthenians for five years. Released from Hellenic war, the Athenians\r\nmade an expedition to Cyprus with two hundred vessels of their own and\r\ntheir allies, under the command of Cimon. Sixty of these were detached\r\nto Egypt at the instance of Amyrtaeus, the king in the marshes; the\r\nrest laid siege to Kitium, from which, however, they were compelled to\r\nretire by the death of Cimon and by scarcity of provisions. Sailing off\r\nSalamis in Cyprus, they fought with the Phoenicians, Cyprians, and\r\nCilicians by land and sea, and, being victorious on both elements\r\ndeparted home, and with them the returned squadron from Egypt. After\r\nthis the Lacedaemonians marched out on a sacred war, and, becoming\r\nmasters of the temple at Delphi, it in the hands of the Delphians.\r\nImmediately after their retreat, the Athenians marched out, became\r\nmasters of the temple, and placed it in the hands of the Phocians.\r\n\r\nSome time after this, Orchomenus, Chaeronea, and some other places in\r\nBoeotia being in the hands of the Boeotian exiles, the Athenians\r\nmarched against the above-mentioned hostile places with a thousand\r\nAthenian heavy infantry and the allied contingents, under the command\r\nof Tolmides, son of Tolmaeus. They took Chaeronea, and made slaves of\r\nthe inhabitants, and, leaving a garrison, commenced their return. On\r\ntheir road they were attacked at Coronea by the Boeotian exiles from\r\nOrchomenus, with some Locrians and Euboean exiles, and others who were\r\nof the same way of thinking, were defeated in battle, and some killed,\r\nothers taken captive. The Athenians evacuated all Boeotia by a treaty\r\nproviding for the recovery of the men; and the exiled Boeotians\r\nreturned, and with all the rest regained their independence.\r\n\r\nThis was soon afterwards followed by the revolt of Euboea from Athens.\r\nPericles had already crossed over with an army of Athenians to the\r\nisland, when news was brought to him that Megara had revolted, that the\r\nPeloponnesians were on the point of invading Attica, and that the\r\nAthenian garrison had been cut off by the Megarians, with the exception\r\nof a few who had taken refuge in Nisaea. The Megarians had introduced\r\nthe Corinthians, Sicyonians, and Epidaurians into the town before they\r\nrevolted. Meanwhile Pericles brought his army back in all haste from\r\nEuboea. After this the Peloponnesians marched into Attica as far as\r\nEleusis and Thrius, ravaging the country under the conduct of King\r\nPleistoanax, the son of Pausanias, and without advancing further\r\nreturned home. The Athenians then crossed over again to Euboea under\r\nthe command of Pericles, and subdued the whole of the island: all but\r\nHistiaea was settled by convention; the Histiaeans they expelled from\r\ntheir homes, and occupied their territory themselves.\r\n\r\nNot long after their return from Euboea, they made a truce with the\r\nLacedaemonians and their allies for thirty years, giving up the posts\r\nwhich they occupied in Peloponnese—Nisaea, Pegae, Troezen, and Achaia.\r\nIn the sixth year of the truce, war broke out between the Samians and\r\nMilesians about Priene. Worsted in the war, the Milesians came to\r\nAthens with loud complaints against the Samians. In this they were\r\njoined by certain private persons from Samos itself, who wished to\r\nrevolutionize the government. Accordingly the Athenians sailed to Samos\r\nwith forty ships and set up a democracy; took hostages from the\r\nSamians, fifty boys and as many men, lodged them in Lemnos, and after\r\nleaving a garrison in the island returned home. But some of the Samians\r\nhad not remained in the island, but had fled to the continent. Making\r\nan agreement with the most powerful of those in the city, and an\r\nalliance with Pissuthnes, son of Hystaspes, the then satrap of Sardis,\r\nthey got together a force of seven hundred mercenaries, and under cover\r\nof night crossed over to Samos. Their first step was to rise on the\r\ncommons, most of whom they secured; their next to steal their hostages\r\nfrom Lemnos; after which they revolted, gave up the Athenian garrison\r\nleft with them and its commanders to Pissuthnes, and instantly prepared\r\nfor an expedition against Miletus. The Byzantines also revolted with\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Athenians heard the news, they sailed with sixty ships\r\nagainst Samos. Sixteen of these went to Caria to look out for the\r\nPhoenician fleet, and to Chios and Lesbos carrying round orders for\r\nreinforcements, and so never engaged; but forty-four ships under the\r\ncommand of Pericles with nine colleagues gave battle, off the island of\r\nTragia, to seventy Samian vessels, of which twenty were transports, as\r\nthey were sailing from Miletus. Victory remained with the Athenians.\r\nReinforced afterwards by forty ships from Athens, and twenty-five Chian\r\nand Lesbian vessels, the Athenians landed, and having the superiority\r\nby land invested the city with three walls; it was also invested from\r\nthe sea. Meanwhile Pericles took sixty ships from the blockading\r\nsquadron, and departed in haste for Caunus and Caria, intelligence\r\nhaving been brought in of the approach of the Phoenician fleet to the\r\naid of the Samians; indeed Stesagoras and others had left the island\r\nwith five ships to bring them. But in the meantime the Samians made a\r\nsudden sally, and fell on the camp, which they found unfortified.\r\nDestroying the look-out vessels, and engaging and defeating such as\r\nwere being launched to meet them, they remained masters of their own\r\nseas for fourteen days, and carried in and carried out what they\r\npleased. But on the arrival of Pericles, they were once more shut up.\r\nFresh reinforcements afterwards arrived—forty ships from Athens with\r\nThucydides, Hagnon, and Phormio; twenty with Tlepolemus and Anticles,\r\nand thirty vessels from Chios and Lesbos. After a brief attempt at\r\nfighting, the Samians, unable to hold out, were reduced after a nine\r\nmonths’ siege and surrendered on conditions; they razed their walls,\r\ngave hostages, delivered up their ships, and arranged to pay the\r\nexpenses of the war by instalments. The Byzantines also agreed to be\r\nsubject as before.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Congress at Lacedaemon—Preparations for War and Diplomatic\r\nSkirmishes—Cylon—Pausanias—Themistocles\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter this, though not many years later, we at length come to what has\r\nbeen already related, the affairs of Corcyra and Potidæa, and the\r\nevents that served as a pretext for the present war. All these actions\r\nof the Hellenes against each other and the barbarian occurred in the\r\nfifty years’ interval between the retreat of Xerxes and the beginning\r\nof the present war. During this interval the Athenians succeeded in\r\nplacing their empire on a firmer basis, and advanced their own home\r\npower to a very great height. The Lacedaemonians, though fully aware of\r\nit, opposed it only for a little while, but remained inactive during\r\nmost of the period, being of old slow to go to war except under the\r\npressure of necessity, and in the present instance being hampered by\r\nwars at home; until the growth of the Athenian power could be no longer\r\nignored, and their own confederacy became the object of its\r\nencroachments. They then felt that they could endure it no longer, but\r\nthat the time had come for them to throw themselves heart and soul upon\r\nthe hostile power, and break it, if they could, by commencing the\r\npresent war. And though the Lacedaemonians had made up their own minds\r\non the fact of the breach of the treaty and the guilt of the Athenians,\r\nyet they sent to Delphi and inquired of the God whether it would be\r\nwell with them if they went to war; and, as it is reported, received\r\nfrom him the answer that if they put their whole strength into the war,\r\nvictory would be theirs, and the promise that he himself would be with\r\nthem, whether invoked or uninvoked. Still they wished to summon their\r\nallies again, and to take their vote on the propriety of making war.\r\nAfter the ambassadors from the confederates had arrived and a congress\r\nhad been convened, they all spoke their minds, most of them denouncing\r\nthe Athenians and demanding that the war should begin. In particular\r\nthe Corinthians. They had before on their own account canvassed the\r\ncities in detail to induce them to vote for the war, in the fear that\r\nit might come too late to save Potidæa; they were present also on this\r\noccasion, and came forward the last, and made the following speech:\r\n\r\n“Fellow allies, we can no longer accuse the Lacedaemonians of having\r\nfailed in their duty: they have not only voted for war themselves, but\r\nhave assembled us here for that purpose. We say their duty, for\r\nsupremacy has its duties. Besides equitably administering private\r\ninterests, leaders are required to show a special care for the common\r\nwelfare in return for the special honours accorded to them by all in\r\nother ways. For ourselves, all who have already had dealings with the\r\nAthenians require no warning to be on their guard against them. The\r\nstates more inland and out of the highway of communication should\r\nunderstand that, if they omit to support the coast powers, the result\r\nwill be to injure the transit of their produce for exportation and the\r\nreception in exchange of their imports from the sea; and they must not\r\nbe careless judges of what is now said, as if it had nothing to do with\r\nthem, but must expect that the sacrifice of the powers on the coast\r\nwill one day be followed by the extension of the danger to the\r\ninterior, and must recognize that their own interests are deeply\r\ninvolved in this discussion. For these reasons they should not hesitate\r\nto exchange peace for war. If wise men remain quiet, while they are not\r\ninjured, brave men abandon peace for war when they are injured,\r\nreturning to an understanding on a favourable opportunity: in fact,\r\nthey are neither intoxicated by their success in war, nor disposed to\r\ntake an injury for the sake of the delightful tranquillity of peace.\r\nIndeed, to falter for the sake of such delights is, if you remain\r\ninactive, the quickest way of losing the sweets of repose to which you\r\ncling; while to conceive extravagant pretensions from success in war is\r\nto forget how hollow is the confidence by which you are elated. For if\r\nmany ill-conceived plans have succeeded through the still greater\r\nfatuity of an opponent, many more, apparently well laid, have on the\r\ncontrary ended in disgrace. The confidence with which we form our\r\nschemes is never completely justified in their execution; speculation\r\nis carried on in safety, but, when it comes to action, fear causes\r\nfailure.\r\n\r\n“To apply these rules to ourselves, if we are now kindling war it is\r\nunder the pressure of injury, with adequate grounds of complaint; and\r\nafter we have chastised the Athenians we will in season desist. We have\r\nmany reasons to expect success—first, superiority in numbers and in\r\nmilitary experience, and secondly our general and unvarying obedience\r\nin the execution of orders. The naval strength which they possess shall\r\nbe raised by us from our respective antecedent resources, and from the\r\nmoneys at Olympia and Delphi. A loan from these enables us to seduce\r\ntheir foreign sailors by the offer of higher pay. For the power of\r\nAthens is more mercenary than national; while ours will not be exposed\r\nto the same risk, as its strength lies more in men than in money. A\r\nsingle defeat at sea is in all likelihood their ruin: should they hold\r\nout, in that case there will be the more time for us to exercise\r\nourselves in naval matters; and as soon as we have arrived at an\r\nequality in science, we need scarcely ask whether we shall be their\r\nsuperiors in courage. For the advantages that we have by nature they\r\ncannot acquire by education; while their superiority in science must be\r\nremoved by our practice. The money required for these objects shall be\r\nprovided by our contributions: nothing indeed could be more monstrous\r\nthan the suggestion that, while their allies never tire of contributing\r\nfor their own servitude, we should refuse to spend for vengeance and\r\nself-preservation the treasure which by such refusal we shall forfeit\r\nto Athenian rapacity and see employed for our own ruin.\r\n\r\n“We have also other ways of carrying on the war, such as revolt of\r\ntheir allies, the surest method of depriving them of their revenues,\r\nwhich are the source of their strength, and establishment of fortified\r\npositions in their country, and various operations which cannot be\r\nforeseen at present. For war of all things proceeds least upon definite\r\nrules, but draws principally upon itself for contrivances to meet an\r\nemergency; and in such cases the party who faces the struggle and keeps\r\nhis temper best meets with most security, and he who loses his temper\r\nabout it with correspondent disaster. Let us also reflect that if it\r\nwas merely a number of disputes of territory between rival neighbours,\r\nit might be borne; but here we have an enemy in Athens that is a match\r\nfor our whole coalition, and more than a match for any of its members;\r\nso that unless as a body and as individual nationalities and individual\r\ncities we make an unanimous stand against her, she will easily conquer\r\nus divided and in detail. That conquest, terrible as it may sound,\r\nwould, it must be known, have no other end than slavery pure and\r\nsimple; a word which Peloponnese cannot even hear whispered without\r\ndisgrace, or without disgrace see so many states abused by one.\r\nMeanwhile the opinion would be either that we were justly so used, or\r\nthat we put up with it from cowardice, and were proving degenerate sons\r\nin not even securing for ourselves the freedom which our fathers gave\r\nto Hellas; and in allowing the establishment in Hellas of a tyrant\r\nstate, though in individual states we think it our duty to put down\r\nsole rulers. And we do not know how this conduct can be held free from\r\nthree of the gravest failings, want of sense, of courage, or of\r\nvigilance. For we do not suppose that you have taken refuge in that\r\ncontempt of an enemy which has proved so fatal in so many instances—a\r\nfeeling which from the numbers that it has ruined has come to be called\r\nnot contemptuous but contemptible.\r\n\r\n“There is, however, no advantage in reflections on the past further\r\nthan may be of service to the present. For the future we must provide\r\nby maintaining what the present gives us and redoubling our efforts; it\r\nis hereditary to us to win virtue as the fruit of labour, and you must\r\nnot change the habit, even though you should have a slight advantage in\r\nwealth and resources; for it is not right that what was won in want\r\nshould be lost in plenty; no, we must boldly advance to the war for\r\nmany reasons; the god has commanded it and promised to be with us, and\r\nthe rest of Hellas will all join in the struggle, part from fear, part\r\nfrom interest. You will be the first to break a treaty which the god,\r\nin advising us to go to war, judges to be violated already, but rather\r\nto support a treaty that has been outraged: indeed, treaties are broken\r\nnot by resistance but by aggression.\r\n\r\n“Your position, therefore, from whatever quarter you may view it, will\r\namply justify you in going to war; and this step we recommend in the\r\ninterests of all, bearing in mind that identity of interest is the\r\nsurest of bonds, whether between states or individuals. Delay not,\r\ntherefore, to assist Potidæa, a Dorian city besieged by Ionians, which\r\nis quite a reversal of the order of things; nor to assert the freedom\r\nof the rest. It is impossible for us to wait any longer when waiting\r\ncan only mean immediate disaster for some of us, and, if it comes to be\r\nknown that we have conferred but do not venture to protect ourselves,\r\nlike disaster in the near future for the rest. Delay not, fellow\r\nallies, but, convinced of the necessity of the crisis and the wisdom of\r\nthis counsel, vote for the war, undeterred by its immediate terrors,\r\nbut looking beyond to the lasting peace by which it will be succeeded.\r\nOut of war peace gains fresh stability, but to refuse to abandon repose\r\nfor war is not so sure a method of avoiding danger. We must believe\r\nthat the tyrant city that has been established in Hellas has been\r\nestablished against all alike, with a programme of universal empire,\r\npart fulfilled, part in contemplation; let us then attack and reduce\r\nit, and win future security for ourselves and freedom for the Hellenes\r\nwho are now enslaved.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of the Corinthians. The Lacedaemonians, having now\r\nheard all, give their opinion, took the vote of all the allied states\r\npresent in order, great and small alike; and the majority voted for\r\nwar. This decided, it was still impossible for them to commence at\r\nonce, from their want of preparation; but it was resolved that the\r\nmeans requisite were to be procured by the different states, and that\r\nthere was to be no delay. And indeed, in spite of the time occupied\r\nwith the necessary arrangements, less than a year elapsed before Attica\r\nwas invaded, and the war openly begun.\r\n\r\nThis interval was spent in sending embassies to Athens charged with\r\ncomplaints, in order to obtain as good a pretext for war as possible,\r\nin the event of her paying no attention to them. The first\r\nLacedaemonian embassy was to order the Athenians to drive out the curse\r\nof the goddess; the history of which is as follows. In former\r\ngenerations there was an Athenian of the name of Cylon, a victor at the\r\nOlympic games, of good birth and powerful position, who had married a\r\ndaughter of Theagenes, a Megarian, at that time tyrant of Megara. Now\r\nthis Cylon was inquiring at Delphi; when he was told by the god to\r\nseize the Acropolis of Athens on the grand festival of Zeus.\r\nAccordingly, procuring a force from Theagenes and persuading his\r\nfriends to join him, when the Olympic festival in Peloponnese came, he\r\nseized the Acropolis, with the intention of making himself tyrant,\r\nthinking that this was the grand festival of Zeus, and also an occasion\r\nappropriate for a victor at the Olympic games. Whether the grand\r\nfestival that was meant was in Attica or elsewhere was a question which\r\nhe never thought of, and which the oracle did not offer to solve. For\r\nthe Athenians also have a festival which is called the grand festival\r\nof Zeus Meilichios or Gracious, viz., the Diasia. It is celebrated\r\noutside the city, and the whole people sacrifice not real victims but a\r\nnumber of bloodless offerings peculiar to the country. However,\r\nfancying he had chosen the right time, he made the attempt. As soon as\r\nthe Athenians perceived it, they flocked in, one and all, from the\r\ncountry, and sat down, and laid siege to the citadel. But as time went\r\non, weary of the labour of blockade, most of them departed; the\r\nresponsibility of keeping guard being left to the nine archons, with\r\nplenary powers to arrange everything according to their good judgment.\r\nIt must be known that at that time most political functions were\r\ndischarged by the nine archons. Meanwhile Cylon and his besieged\r\ncompanions were distressed for want of food and water. Accordingly\r\nCylon and his brother made their escape; but the rest being hard\r\npressed, and some even dying of famine, seated themselves as suppliants\r\nat the altar in the Acropolis. The Athenians who were charged with the\r\nduty of keeping guard, when they saw them at the point of death in the\r\ntemple, raised them up on the understanding that no harm should be done\r\nto them, led them out, and slew them. Some who as they passed by took\r\nrefuge at the altars of the awful goddesses were dispatched on the\r\nspot. From this deed the men who killed them were called accursed and\r\nguilty against the goddess, they and their descendants. Accordingly\r\nthese cursed ones were driven out by the Athenians, driven out again by\r\nCleomenes of Lacedaemon and an Athenian faction; the living were driven\r\nout, and the bones of the dead were taken up; thus they were cast out.\r\nFor all that, they came back afterwards, and their descendants are\r\nstill in the city.\r\n\r\nThis, then was the curse that the Lacedaemonians ordered them to drive\r\nout. They were actuated primarily, as they pretended, by a care for the\r\nhonour of the gods; but they also know that Pericles, son of\r\nXanthippus, was connected with the curse on his mother’s side, and they\r\nthought that his banishment would materially advance their designs on\r\nAthens. Not that they really hoped to succeed in procuring this; they\r\nrather thought to create a prejudice against him in the eyes of his\r\ncountrymen from the feeling that the war would be partly caused by his\r\nmisfortune. For being the most powerful man of his time, and the\r\nleading Athenian statesman, he opposed the Lacedaemonians in\r\neverything, and would have no concessions, but ever urged the Athenians\r\non to war.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians retorted by ordering the Lacedaemonians to drive out the\r\ncurse of Taenarus. The Lacedaemonians had once raised up some Helot\r\nsuppliants from the temple of Poseidon at Taenarus, led them away and\r\nslain them; for which they believe the great earthquake at Sparta to\r\nhave been a retribution. The Athenians also ordered them to drive out\r\nthe curse of the goddess of the Brazen House; the history of which is\r\nas follows. After Pausanias the Lacedaemonian had been recalled by the\r\nSpartans from his command in the Hellespont (this is his first recall),\r\nand had been tried by them and acquitted, not being again sent out in a\r\npublic capacity, he took a galley of Hermione on his own\r\nresponsibility, without the authority of the Lacedaemonians, and\r\narrived as a private person in the Hellespont. He came ostensibly for\r\nthe Hellenic war, really to carry on his intrigues with the King, which\r\nhe had begun before his recall, being ambitious of reigning over\r\nHellas. The circumstance which first enabled him to lay the King under\r\nan obligation, and to make a beginning of the whole design, was this.\r\nSome connections and kinsmen of the King had been taken in Byzantium,\r\non its capture from the Medes, when he was first there, after the\r\nreturn from Cyprus. These captives he sent off to the King without the\r\nknowledge of the rest of the allies, the account being that they had\r\nescaped from him. He managed this with the help of Gongylus, an\r\nEretrian, whom he had placed in charge of Byzantium and the prisoners.\r\nHe also gave Gongylus a letter for the King, the contents of which were\r\nas follows, as was afterwards discovered: “Pausanias, the general of\r\nSparta, anxious to do you a favour, sends you these his prisoners of\r\nwar. I propose also, with your approval, to marry your daughter, and to\r\nmake Sparta and the rest of Hellas subject to you. I may say that I\r\nthink I am able to do this, with your co-operation. Accordingly if any\r\nof this please you, send a safe man to the sea through whom we may in\r\nfuture conduct our correspondence.”\r\n\r\nThis was all that was revealed in the writing, and Xerxes was pleased\r\nwith the letter. He sent off Artabazus, son of Pharnaces, to the sea\r\nwith orders to supersede Megabates, the previous governor in the\r\nsatrapy of Daskylion, and to send over as quickly as possible to\r\nPausanias at Byzantium a letter which he entrusted to him; to show him\r\nthe royal signet, and to execute any commission which he might receive\r\nfrom Pausanias on the King’s matters with all care and fidelity.\r\nArtabazus on his arrival carried the King’s orders into effect, and\r\nsent over the letter, which contained the following answer: “Thus saith\r\nKing Xerxes to Pausanias. For the men whom you have saved for me across\r\nsea from Byzantium, an obligation is laid up for you in our house,\r\nrecorded for ever; and with your proposals I am well pleased. Let\r\nneither night nor day stop you from diligently performing any of your\r\npromises to me; neither for cost of gold nor of silver let them be\r\nhindered, nor yet for number of troops, wherever it may be that their\r\npresence is needed; but with Artabazus, an honourable man whom I send\r\nyou, boldly advance my objects and yours, as may be most for the honour\r\nand interest of us both.”\r\n\r\nBefore held in high honour by the Hellenes as the hero of Plataea,\r\nPausanias, after the receipt of this letter, became prouder than ever,\r\nand could no longer live in the usual style, but went out of Byzantium\r\nin a Median dress, was attended on his march through Thrace by a\r\nbodyguard of Medes and Egyptians, kept a Persian table, and was quite\r\nunable to contain his intentions, but betrayed by his conduct in\r\ntrifles what his ambition looked one day to enact on a grander scale.\r\nHe also made himself difficult of access, and displayed so violent a\r\ntemper to every one without exception that no one could come near him.\r\nIndeed, this was the principal reason why the confederacy went over to\r\nthe Athenians.\r\n\r\nThe above-mentioned conduct, coming to the ears of the Lacedaemonians,\r\noccasioned his first recall. And after his second voyage out in the\r\nship of Hermione, without their orders, he gave proofs of similar\r\nbehaviour. Besieged and expelled from Byzantium by the Athenians, he\r\ndid not return to Sparta; but news came that he had settled at Colonae\r\nin the Troad, and was intriguing with the barbarians, and that his stay\r\nthere was for no good purpose; and the ephors, now no longer\r\nhesitating, sent him a herald and a scytale with orders to accompany\r\nthe herald or be declared a public enemy. Anxious above everything to\r\navoid suspicion, and confident that he could quash the charge by means\r\nof money, he returned a second time to Sparta. At first thrown into\r\nprison by the ephors (whose powers enable them to do this to the King),\r\nsoon compromised the matter and came out again, and offered himself for\r\ntrial to any who wished to institute an inquiry concerning him.\r\n\r\nNow the Spartans had no tangible proof against him—neither his enemies\r\nnor the nation—of that indubitable kind required for the punishment of\r\na member of the royal family, and at that moment in high office; he\r\nbeing regent for his first cousin King Pleistarchus, Leonidas’s son,\r\nwho was still a minor. But by his contempt of the laws and imitation of\r\nthe barbarians, he gave grounds for much suspicion of his being\r\ndiscontented with things established; all the occasions on which he had\r\nin any way departed from the regular customs were passed in review, and\r\nit was remembered that he had taken upon himself to have inscribed on\r\nthe tripod at Delphi, which was dedicated by the Hellenes as the\r\nfirst-fruits of the spoil of the Medes, the following couplet:\r\n\r\nThe Mede defeated, great Pausanias raised\r\nThis monument, that Phœbus might be praised.\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the time the Lacedaemonians had at once erased the couplet, and\r\ninscribed the names of the cities that had aided in the overthrow of\r\nthe barbarian and dedicated the offering. Yet it was considered that\r\nPausanias had here been guilty of a grave offence, which, interpreted\r\nby the light of the attitude which he had since assumed, gained a new\r\nsignificance, and seemed to be quite in keeping with his present\r\nschemes. Besides, they were informed that he was even intriguing with\r\nthe Helots; and such indeed was the fact, for he promised them freedom\r\nand citizenship if they would join him in insurrection and would help\r\nhim to carry out his plans to the end. Even now, mistrusting the\r\nevidence even of the Helots themselves, the ephors would not consent to\r\ntake any decided step against him; in accordance with their regular\r\ncustom towards themselves, namely, to be slow in taking any irrevocable\r\nresolve in the matter of a Spartan citizen without indisputable proof.\r\nAt last, it is said, the person who was going to carry to Artabazus the\r\nlast letter for the King, a man of Argilus, once the favourite and most\r\ntrusty servant of Pausanias, turned informer. Alarmed by the reflection\r\nthat none of the previous messengers had ever returned, having\r\ncounterfeited the seal, in order that, if he found himself mistaken in\r\nhis surmises, or if Pausanias should ask to make some correction, he\r\nmight not be discovered, he undid the letter, and found the postscript\r\nthat he had suspected, viz. an order to put him to death.\r\n\r\nOn being shown the letter, the ephors now felt more certain. Still,\r\nthey wished to hear Pausanias commit himself with their own ears.\r\nAccordingly the man went by appointment to Taenarus as a suppliant, and\r\nthere built himself a hut divided into two by a partition; within which\r\nhe concealed some of the ephors and let them hear the whole matter\r\nplainly. For Pausanias came to him and asked him the reason of his\r\nsuppliant position; and the man reproached him with the order that he\r\nhad written concerning him, and one by one declared all the rest of the\r\ncircumstances, how he who had never yet brought him into any danger,\r\nwhile employed as agent between him and the King, was yet just like the\r\nmass of his servants to be rewarded with death. Admitting all this, and\r\ntelling him not to be angry about the matter, Pausanias gave him the\r\npledge of raising him up from the temple, and begged him to set off as\r\nquickly as possible, and not to hinder the business in hand.\r\n\r\nThe ephors listened carefully, and then departed, taking no action for\r\nthe moment, but, having at last attained to certainty, were preparing\r\nto arrest him in the city. It is reported that, as he was about to be\r\narrested in the street, he saw from the face of one of the ephors what\r\nhe was coming for; another, too, made him a secret signal, and betrayed\r\nit to him from kindness. Setting off with a run for the temple of the\r\ngoddess of the Brazen House, the enclosure of which was near at hand,\r\nhe succeeded in taking sanctuary before they took him, and entering\r\ninto a small chamber, which formed part of the temple, to avoid being\r\nexposed to the weather, lay still there. The ephors, for the moment\r\ndistanced in the pursuit, afterwards took off the roof of the chamber,\r\nand having made sure that he was inside, shut him in, barricaded the\r\ndoors, and staying before the place, reduced him by starvation. When\r\nthey found that he was on the point of expiring, just as he was, in the\r\nchamber, they brought him out of the temple, while the breath was still\r\nin him, and as soon as he was brought out he died. They were going to\r\nthrow him into the Kaiadas, where they cast criminals, but finally\r\ndecided to inter him somewhere near. But the god at Delphi afterwards\r\nordered the Lacedaemonians to remove the tomb to the place of his\r\ndeath—where he now lies in the consecrated ground, as an inscription on\r\na monument declares—and, as what had been done was a curse to them, to\r\ngive back two bodies instead of one to the goddess of the Brazen House.\r\nSo they had two brazen statues made, and dedicated them as a substitute\r\nfor Pausanias. The Athenians retorted by telling the Lacedaemonians to\r\ndrive out what the god himself had pronounced to be a curse.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Medism of Pausanias. Matter was found in the course of\r\nthe inquiry to implicate Themistocles; and the Lacedaemonians\r\naccordingly sent envoys to the Athenians and required them to punish\r\nhim as they had punished Pausanias. The Athenians consented to do so.\r\nBut he had, as it happened, been ostracized, and, with a residence at\r\nArgos, was in the habit of visiting other parts of Peloponnese. So they\r\nsent with the Lacedaemonians, who were ready to join in the pursuit,\r\npersons with instructions to take him wherever they found him. But\r\nThemistocles got scent of their intentions, and fled from Peloponnese\r\nto Corcyra, which was under obligations towards him. But the\r\nCorcyraeans alleged that they could not venture to shelter him at the\r\ncost of offending Athens and Lacedaemon, and they conveyed him over to\r\nthe continent opposite. Pursued by the officers who hung on the report\r\nof his movements, at a loss where to turn, he was compelled to stop at\r\nthe house of Admetus, the Molossian king, though they were not on\r\nfriendly terms. Admetus happened not to be indoors, but his wife, to\r\nwhom he made himself a suppliant, instructed him to take their child in\r\nhis arms and sit down by the hearth. Soon afterwards Admetus came in,\r\nand Themistocles told him who he was, and begged him not to revenge on\r\nThemistocles in exile any opposition which his requests might have\r\nexperienced from Themistocles at Athens. Indeed, he was now far too low\r\nfor his revenge; retaliation was only honourable between equals.\r\nBesides, his opposition to the king had only affected the success of a\r\nrequest, not the safety of his person; if the king were to give him up\r\nto the pursuers that he mentioned, and the fate which they intended for\r\nhim, he would just be consigning him to certain death.\r\n\r\nThe King listened to him and raised him up with his son, as he was\r\nsitting with him in his arms after the most effectual method of\r\nsupplication, and on the arrival of the Lacedaemonians not long\r\nafterwards, refused to give him up for anything they could say, but\r\nsent him off by land to the other sea to Pydna in Alexander’s\r\ndominions, as he wished to go to the Persian king. There he met with a\r\nmerchantman on the point of starting for Ionia. Going on board, he was\r\ncarried by a storm to the Athenian squadron which was blockading Naxos.\r\nIn his alarm—he was luckily unknown to the people in the vessel—he told\r\nthe master who he was and what he was flying for, and said that, if he\r\nrefused to save him, he would declare that he was taking him for a\r\nbribe. Meanwhile their safety consisted in letting no one leave the\r\nship until a favourable time for sailing should arise. If he complied\r\nwith his wishes, he promised him a proper recompense. The master acted\r\nas he desired, and, after lying to for a day and a night out of reach\r\nof the squadron, at length arrived at Ephesus.\r\n\r\nAfter having rewarded him with a present of money, as soon as he\r\nreceived some from his friends at Athens and from his secret hoards at\r\nArgos, Themistocles started inland with one of the coast Persians, and\r\nsent a letter to King Artaxerxes, Xerxes’s son, who had just come to\r\nthe throne. Its contents were as follows: “I, Themistocles, am come to\r\nyou, who did your house more harm than any of the Hellenes, when I was\r\ncompelled to defend myself against your father’s invasion—harm,\r\nhowever, far surpassed by the good that I did him during his retreat,\r\nwhich brought no danger for me but much for him. For the past, you are\r\na good turn in my debt”—here he mentioned the warning sent to Xerxes\r\nfrom Salamis to retreat, as well as his finding the bridges unbroken,\r\nwhich, as he falsely pretended, was due to him—“for the present, able\r\nto do you great service, I am here, pursued by the Hellenes for my\r\nfriendship for you. However, I desire a year’s grace, when I shall be\r\nable to declare in person the objects of my coming.”\r\n\r\nIt is said that the King approved his intention, and told him to do as\r\nhe said. He employed the interval in making what progress he could in\r\nthe study of the Persian tongue, and of the customs of the country.\r\nArrived at court at the end of the year, he attained to very high\r\nconsideration there, such as no Hellene has ever possessed before or\r\nsince; partly from his splendid antecedents, partly from the hopes\r\nwhich he held out of effecting for him the subjugation of Hellas, but\r\nprincipally by the proof which experience daily gave of his capacity.\r\nFor Themistocles was a man who exhibited the most indubitable signs of\r\ngenius; indeed, in this particular he has a claim on our admiration\r\nquite extraordinary and unparalleled. By his own native capacity, alike\r\nunformed and unsupplemented by study, he was at once the best judge in\r\nthose sudden crises which admit of little or of no deliberation, and\r\nthe best prophet of the future, even to its most distant possibilities.\r\nAn able theoretical expositor of all that came within the sphere of his\r\npractice, he was not without the power of passing an adequate judgment\r\nin matters in which he had no experience. He could also excellently\r\ndivine the good and evil which lay hid in the unseen future. In fine,\r\nwhether we consider the extent of his natural powers, or the slightness\r\nof his application, this extraordinary man must be allowed to have\r\nsurpassed all others in the faculty of intuitively meeting an\r\nemergency. Disease was the real cause of his death; though there is a\r\nstory of his having ended his life by poison, on finding himself unable\r\nto fulfil his promises to the king. However this may be, there is a\r\nmonument to him in the marketplace of Asiatic Magnesia. He was governor\r\nof the district, the King having given him Magnesia, which brought in\r\nfifty talents a year, for bread, Lampsacus, which was considered to be\r\nthe richest wine country, for wine, and Myos for other provisions. His\r\nbones, it is said, were conveyed home by his relatives in accordance\r\nwith his wishes, and interred in Attic ground. This was done without\r\nthe knowledge of the Athenians; as it is against the law to bury in\r\nAttica an outlaw for treason. So ends the history of Pausanias and\r\nThemistocles, the Lacedaemonian and the Athenian, the most famous men\r\nof their time in Hellas.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Lacedaemonians. The history of their first embassy,\r\nthe injunctions which it conveyed, and the rejoinder which it provoked,\r\nconcerning the expulsion of the accursed persons, have been related\r\nalready. It was followed by a second, which ordered Athens to raise the\r\nsiege of Potidæa, and to respect the independence of Aegina. Above all,\r\nit gave her most distinctly to understand that war might be prevented\r\nby the revocation of the Megara decree, excluding the Megarians from\r\nthe use of Athenian harbours and of the market of Athens. But Athens\r\nwas not inclined either to revoke the decree, or to entertain their\r\nother proposals; she accused the Megarians of pushing their cultivation\r\ninto the consecrated ground and the unenclosed land on the border, and\r\nof harbouring her runaway slaves. At last an embassy arrived with the\r\nLacedaemonian ultimatum. The ambassadors were Ramphias, Melesippus, and\r\nAgesander. Not a word was said on any of the old subjects; there was\r\nsimply this: “Lacedaemon wishes the peace to continue, and there is no\r\nreason why it should not, if you would leave the Hellenes independent.”\r\nUpon this the Athenians held an assembly, and laid the matter before\r\ntheir consideration. It was resolved to deliberate once for all on all\r\ntheir demands, and to give them an answer. There were many speakers who\r\ncame forward and gave their support to one side or the other, urging\r\nthe necessity of war, or the revocation of the decree and the folly of\r\nallowing it to stand in the way of peace. Among them came forward\r\nPericles, son of Xanthippus, the first man of his time at Athens,\r\nablest alike in counsel and in action, and gave the following advice:\r\n\r\n“There is one principle, Athenians, which I hold to through everything,\r\nand that is the principle of no concession to the Peloponnesians. I\r\nknow that the spirit which inspires men while they are being persuaded\r\nto make war is not always retained in action; that as circumstances\r\nchange, resolutions change. Yet I see that now as before the same,\r\nalmost literally the same, counsel is demanded of me; and I put it to\r\nthose of you who are allowing yourselves to be persuaded, to support\r\nthe national resolves even in the case of reverses, or to forfeit all\r\ncredit for their wisdom in the event of success. For sometimes the\r\ncourse of things is as arbitrary as the plans of man; indeed this is\r\nwhy we usually blame chance for whatever does not happen as we\r\nexpected. Now it was clear before that Lacedaemon entertained designs\r\nagainst us; it is still more clear now. The treaty provides that we\r\nshall mutually submit our differences to legal settlement, and that we\r\nshall meanwhile each keep what we have. Yet the Lacedaemonians never\r\nyet made us any such offer, never yet would accept from us any such\r\noffer; on the contrary, they wish complaints to be settled by war\r\ninstead of by negotiation; and in the end we find them here dropping\r\nthe tone of expostulation and adopting that of command. They order us\r\nto raise the siege of Potidæa, to let Aegina be independent, to revoke\r\nthe Megara decree; and they conclude with an ultimatum warning us to\r\nleave the Hellenes independent. I hope that you will none of you think\r\nthat we shall be going to war for a trifle if we refuse to revoke the\r\nMegara decree, which appears in front of their complaints, and the\r\nrevocation of which is to save us from war, or let any feeling of\r\nself-reproach linger in your minds, as if you went to war for slight\r\ncause. Why, this trifle contains the whole seal and trial of your\r\nresolution. If you give way, you will instantly have to meet some\r\ngreater demand, as having been frightened into obedience in the first\r\ninstance; while a firm refusal will make them clearly understand that\r\nthey must treat you more as equals. Make your decision therefore at\r\nonce, either to submit before you are harmed, or if we are to go to\r\nwar, as I for one think we ought, to do so without caring whether the\r\nostensible cause be great or small, resolved against making concessions\r\nor consenting to a precarious tenure of our possessions. For all claims\r\nfrom an equal, urged upon a neighbour as commands before any attempt at\r\nlegal settlement, be they great or be they small, have only one\r\nmeaning, and that is slavery.\r\n\r\n“As to the war and the resources of either party, a detailed comparison\r\nwill not show you the inferiority of Athens. Personally engaged in the\r\ncultivation of their land, without funds either private or public, the\r\nPeloponnesians are also without experience in long wars across sea,\r\nfrom the strict limit which poverty imposes on their attacks upon each\r\nother. Powers of this description are quite incapable of often manning\r\na fleet or often sending out an army: they cannot afford the absence\r\nfrom their homes, the expenditure from their own funds; and besides,\r\nthey have not command of the sea. Capital, it must be remembered,\r\nmaintains a war more than forced contributions. Farmers are a class of\r\nmen that are always more ready to serve in person than in purse.\r\nConfident that the former will survive the dangers, they are by no\r\nmeans so sure that the latter will not be prematurely exhausted,\r\nespecially if the war last longer than they expect, which it very\r\nlikely will. In a single battle the Peloponnesians and their allies may\r\nbe able to defy all Hellas, but they are incapacitated from carrying on\r\na war against a power different in character from their own, by the\r\nwant of the single council-chamber requisite to prompt and vigorous\r\naction, and the substitution of a diet composed of various races, in\r\nwhich every state possesses an equal vote, and each presses its own\r\nends, a condition of things which generally results in no action at\r\nall. The great wish of some is to avenge themselves on some particular\r\nenemy, the great wish of others to save their own pocket. Slow in\r\nassembling, they devote a very small fraction of the time to the\r\nconsideration of any public object, most of it to the prosecution of\r\ntheir own objects. Meanwhile each fancies that no harm will come of his\r\nneglect, that it is the business of somebody else to look after this or\r\nthat for him; and so, by the same notion being entertained by all\r\nseparately, the common cause imperceptibly decays.\r\n\r\n“But the principal point is the hindrance that they will experience\r\nfrom want of money. The slowness with which it comes in will cause\r\ndelay; but the opportunities of war wait for no man. Again, we need not\r\nbe alarmed either at the possibility of their raising fortifications in\r\nAttica, or at their navy. It would be difficult for any system of\r\nfortifications to establish a rival city, even in time of peace, much\r\nmore, surely, in an enemy’s country, with Athens just as much fortified\r\nagainst it as it against Athens; while a mere post might be able to do\r\nsome harm to the country by incursions and by the facilities which it\r\nwould afford for desertion, but can never prevent our sailing into\r\ntheir country and raising fortifications there, and making reprisals\r\nwith our powerful fleet. For our naval skill is of more use to us for\r\nservice on land, than their military skill for service at sea.\r\nFamiliarity with the sea they will not find an easy acquisition. If you\r\nwho have been practising at it ever since the Median invasion have not\r\nyet brought it to perfection, is there any chance of anything\r\nconsiderable being effected by an agricultural, unseafaring population,\r\nwho will besides be prevented from practising by the constant presence\r\nof strong squadrons of observation from Athens? With a small squadron\r\nthey might hazard an engagement, encouraging their ignorance by\r\nnumbers; but the restraint of a strong force will prevent their moving,\r\nand through want of practice they will grow more clumsy, and\r\nconsequently more timid. It must be kept in mind that seamanship, just\r\nlike anything else, is a matter of art, and will not admit of being\r\ntaken up occasionally as an occupation for times of leisure; on the\r\ncontrary, it is so exacting as to leave leisure for nothing else.\r\n\r\n“Even if they were to touch the moneys at Olympia or Delphi, and try to\r\nseduce our foreign sailors by the temptation of higher pay, that would\r\nonly be a serious danger if we could not still be a match for them by\r\nembarking our own citizens and the aliens resident among us. But in\r\nfact by this means we are always a match for them; and, best of all, we\r\nhave a larger and higher class of native coxswains and sailors among\r\nour own citizens than all the rest of Hellas. And to say nothing of the\r\ndanger of such a step, none of our foreign sailors would consent to\r\nbecome an outlaw from his country, and to take service with them and\r\ntheir hopes, for the sake of a few days’ high pay.\r\n\r\n“This, I think, is a tolerably fair account of the position of the\r\nPeloponnesians; that of Athens is free from the defects that I have\r\ncriticized in them, and has other advantages of its own, which they can\r\nshow nothing to equal. If they march against our country we will sail\r\nagainst theirs, and it will then be found that the desolation of the\r\nwhole of Attica is not the same as that of even a fraction of\r\nPeloponnese; for they will not be able to supply the deficiency except\r\nby a battle, while we have plenty of land both on the islands and the\r\ncontinent. The rule of the sea is indeed a great matter. Consider for a\r\nmoment. Suppose that we were islanders; can you conceive a more\r\nimpregnable position? Well, this in future should, as far as possible,\r\nbe our conception of our position. Dismissing all thought of our land\r\nand houses, we must vigilantly guard the sea and the city. No\r\nirritation that we may feel for the former must provoke us to a battle\r\nwith the numerical superiority of the Peloponnesians. A victory would\r\nonly be succeeded by another battle against the same superiority: a\r\nreverse involves the loss of our allies, the source of our strength,\r\nwho will not remain quiet a day after we become unable to march against\r\nthem. We must cry not over the loss of houses and land but of men’s\r\nlives; since houses and land do not gain men, but men them. And if I\r\nhad thought that I could persuade you, I would have bid you go out and\r\nlay them waste with your own hands, and show the Peloponnesians that\r\nthis at any rate will not make you submit.\r\n\r\n“I have many other reasons to hope for a favourable issue, if you can\r\nconsent not to combine schemes of fresh conquest with the conduct of\r\nthe war, and will abstain from wilfully involving yourselves in other\r\ndangers; indeed, I am more afraid of our own blunders than of the\r\nenemy’s devices. But these matters shall be explained in another\r\nspeech, as events require; for the present dismiss these men with the\r\nanswer that we will allow Megara the use of our market and harbours,\r\nwhen the Lacedaemonians suspend their alien acts in favour of us and\r\nour allies, there being nothing in the treaty to prevent either one or\r\nthe other: that we will leave the cities independent, if independent we\r\nfound them when we made the treaty, and when the Lacedaemonians grant\r\nto their cities an independence not involving subservience to\r\nLacedaemonian interests, but such as each severally may desire: that we\r\nare willing to give the legal satisfaction which our agreements\r\nspecify, and that we shall not commence hostilities, but shall resist\r\nthose who do commence them. This is an answer agreeable at once to the\r\nrights and the dignity of Athens. It must be thoroughly understood that\r\nwar is a necessity; but that the more readily we accept it, the less\r\nwill be the ardour of our opponents, and that out of the greatest\r\ndangers communities and individuals acquire the greatest glory. Did not\r\nour fathers resist the Medes not only with resources far different from\r\nours, but even when those resources had been abandoned; and more by\r\nwisdom than by fortune, more by daring than by strength, did not they\r\nbeat off the barbarian and advance their affairs to their present\r\nheight? We must not fall behind them, but must resist our enemies in\r\nany way and in every way, and attempt to hand down our power to our\r\nposterity unimpaired.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Pericles. The Athenians, persuaded of the wisdom\r\nof his advice, voted as he desired, and answered the Lacedaemonians as\r\nhe recommended, both on the separate points and in the general; they\r\nwould do nothing on dictation, but were ready to have the complaints\r\nsettled in a fair and impartial manner by the legal method, which the\r\nterms of the truce prescribed. So the envoys departed home and did not\r\nreturn again.\r\n\r\nThese were the charges and differences existing between the rival\r\npowers before the war, arising immediately from the affair at Epidamnus\r\nand Corcyra. Still intercourse continued in spite of them, and mutual\r\ncommunication. It was carried on without heralds, but not without\r\nsuspicion, as events were occurring which were equivalent to a breach\r\nof the treaty and matter for war.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK II\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n\r\nBeginning of the Peloponnesian War—First Invasion of Attica—Funeral\r\nOration of Pericles\r\n\r\n\r\nThe war between the Athenians and Peloponnesians and the allies on\r\neither side now really begins. For now all intercourse except through\r\nthe medium of heralds ceased, and hostilities were commenced and\r\nprosecuted without intermission. The history follows the chronological\r\norder of events by summers and winters.\r\n\r\nThe thirty years’ truce which was entered into after the conquest of\r\nEuboea lasted fourteen years. In the fifteenth, in the forty-eighth\r\nyear of the priestess-ship of Chrysis at Argos, in the ephorate of\r\nAenesias at Sparta, in the last month but two of the archonship of\r\nPythodorus at Athens, and six months after the battle of Potidæa, just\r\nat the beginning of spring, a Theban force a little over three hundred\r\nstrong, under the command of their Boeotarchs, Pythangelus, son of\r\nPhyleides, and Diemporus, son of Onetorides, about the first watch of\r\nthe night, made an armed entry into Plataea, a town of Boeotia in\r\nalliance with Athens. The gates were opened to them by a Plataean\r\ncalled Naucleides, who, with his party, had invited them in, meaning to\r\nput to death the citizens of the opposite party, bring over the city to\r\nThebes, and thus obtain power for themselves. This was arranged through\r\nEurymachus, son of Leontiades, a person of great influence at Thebes.\r\nFor Plataea had always been at variance with Thebes; and the latter,\r\nforeseeing that war was at hand, wished to surprise her old enemy in\r\ntime of peace, before hostilities had actually broken out. Indeed this\r\nwas how they got in so easily without being observed, as no guard had\r\nbeen posted. After the soldiers had grounded arms in the market-place,\r\nthose who had invited them in wished them to set to work at once and go\r\nto their enemies’ houses. This, however, the Thebans refused to do, but\r\ndetermined to make a conciliatory proclamation, and if possible to come\r\nto a friendly understanding with the citizens. Their herald accordingly\r\ninvited any who wished to resume their old place in the confederacy of\r\ntheir countrymen to ground arms with them, for they thought that in\r\nthis way the city would readily join them.\r\n\r\nOn becoming aware of the presence of the Thebans within their gates,\r\nand of the sudden occupation of the town, the Plataeans concluded in\r\ntheir alarm that more had entered than was really the case, the night\r\npreventing their seeing them. They accordingly came to terms and,\r\naccepting the proposal, made no movement; especially as the Thebans\r\noffered none of them any violence. But somehow or other, during the\r\nnegotiations, they discovered the scanty numbers of the Thebans, and\r\ndecided that they could easily attack and overpower them; the mass of\r\nthe Plataeans being averse to revolting from Athens. At all events they\r\nresolved to attempt it. Digging through the party walls of the houses,\r\nthey thus managed to join each other without being seen going through\r\nthe streets, in which they placed wagons without the beasts in them, to\r\nserve as a barricade, and arranged everything else as seemed convenient\r\nfor the occasion. When everything had been done that circumstances\r\npermitted, they watched their opportunity and went out of their houses\r\nagainst the enemy. It was still night, though daybreak was at hand: in\r\ndaylight it was thought that their attack would be met by men full of\r\ncourage and on equal terms with their assailants, while in darkness it\r\nwould fall upon panic-stricken troops, who would also be at a\r\ndisadvantage from their enemy’s knowledge of the locality. So they made\r\ntheir assault at once, and came to close quarters as quickly as they\r\ncould.\r\n\r\nThe Thebans, finding themselves outwitted, immediately closed up to\r\nrepel all attacks made upon them. Twice or thrice they beat back their\r\nassailants. But the men shouted and charged them, the women and slaves\r\nscreamed and yelled from the houses and pelted them with stones and\r\ntiles; besides, it had been raining hard all night; and so at last\r\ntheir courage gave way, and they turned and fled through the town. Most\r\nof the fugitives were quite ignorant of the right ways out, and this,\r\nwith the mud, and the darkness caused by the moon being in her last\r\nquarter, and the fact that their pursuers knew their way about and\r\ncould easily stop their escape, proved fatal to many. The only gate\r\nopen was the one by which they had entered, and this was shut by one of\r\nthe Plataeans driving the spike of a javelin into the bar instead of\r\nthe bolt; so that even here there was no longer any means of exit. They\r\nwere now chased all over the town. Some got on the wall and threw\r\nthemselves over, in most cases with a fatal result. One party managed\r\nto find a deserted gate, and obtaining an axe from a woman, cut through\r\nthe bar; but as they were soon observed only a few succeeded in getting\r\nout. Others were cut off in detail in different parts of the city. The\r\nmost numerous and compact body rushed into a large building next to the\r\ncity wall: the doors on the side of the street happened to be open, and\r\nthe Thebans fancied that they were the gates of the town, and that\r\nthere was a passage right through to the outside. The Plataeans, seeing\r\ntheir enemies in a trap, now consulted whether they should set fire to\r\nthe building and burn them just as they were, or whether there was\r\nanything else that they could do with them; until at length these and\r\nthe rest of the Theban survivors found wandering about the town agreed\r\nto an unconditional surrender of themselves and their arms to the\r\nPlataeans.\r\n\r\nWhile such was the fate of the party in Plataea, the rest of the\r\nThebans who were to have joined them with all their forces before\r\ndaybreak, in case of anything miscarrying with the body that had\r\nentered, received the news of the affair on the road, and pressed\r\nforward to their succour. Now Plataea is nearly eight miles from\r\nThebes, and their march delayed by the rain that had fallen in the\r\nnight, for the river Asopus had risen and was not easy of passage; and\r\nso, having to march in the rain, and being hindered in crossing the\r\nriver, they arrived too late, and found the whole party either slain or\r\ncaptive. When they learned what had happened, they at once formed a\r\ndesign against the Plataeans outside the city. As the attack had been\r\nmade in time of peace, and was perfectly unexpected, there were of\r\ncourse men and stock in the fields; and the Thebans wished if possible\r\nto have some prisoners to exchange against their countrymen in the\r\ntown, should any chance to have been taken alive. Such was their plan.\r\nBut the Plataeans suspected their intention almost before it was\r\nformed, and becoming alarmed for their fellow citizens outside the\r\ntown, sent a herald to the Thebans, reproaching them for their\r\nunscrupulous attempt to seize their city in time of peace, and warning\r\nthem against any outrage on those outside. Should the warning be\r\ndisregarded, they threatened to put to death the men they had in their\r\nhands, but added that, on the Thebans retiring from their territory,\r\nthey would surrender the prisoners to their friends. This is the Theban\r\naccount of the matter, and they say that they had an oath given them.\r\nThe Plataeans, on the other hand, do not admit any promise of an\r\nimmediate surrender, but make it contingent upon subsequent\r\nnegotiation: the oath they deny altogether. Be this as it may, upon the\r\nThebans retiring from their territory without committing any injury,\r\nthe Plataeans hastily got in whatever they had in the country and\r\nimmediately put the men to death. The prisoners were a hundred and\r\neighty in number; Eurymachus, the person with whom the traitors had\r\nnegotiated, being one.\r\n\r\nThis done, the Plataeans sent a messenger to Athens, gave back the dead\r\nto the Thebans under a truce, and arranged things in the city as seemed\r\nbest to meet the present emergency. The Athenians meanwhile, having had\r\nword of the affair sent them immediately after its occurrence, had\r\ninstantly seized all the Boeotians in Attica, and sent a herald to the\r\nPlataeans to forbid their proceeding to extremities with their Theban\r\nprisoners without instructions from Athens. The news of the men’s death\r\nhad of course not arrived; the first messenger having left Plataea just\r\nwhen the Thebans entered it, the second just after their defeat and\r\ncapture; so there was no later news. Thus the Athenians sent orders in\r\nignorance of the facts; and the herald on his arrival found the men\r\nslain. After this the Athenians marched to Plataea and brought in\r\nprovisions, and left a garrison in the place, also taking away the\r\nwomen and children and such of the men as were least efficient.\r\n\r\nAfter the affair at Plataea, the treaty had been broken by an overt\r\nact, and Athens at once prepared for war, as did also Lacedaemon and\r\nher allies. They resolved to send embassies to the King and to such\r\nother of the barbarian powers as either party could look to for\r\nassistance, and tried to ally themselves with the independent states at\r\nhome. Lacedaemon, in addition to the existing marine, gave orders to\r\nthe states that had declared for her in Italy and Sicily to build\r\nvessels up to a grand total of five hundred, the quota of each city\r\nbeing determined by its size, and also to provide a specified sum of\r\nmoney. Till these were ready they were to remain neutral and to admit\r\nsingle Athenian ships into their harbours. Athens on her part reviewed\r\nher existing confederacy, and sent embassies to the places more\r\nimmediately round Peloponnese—Corcyra, Cephallenia, Acarnania, and\r\nZacynthus—perceiving that if these could be relied on she could carry\r\nthe war all round Peloponnese.\r\n\r\nAnd if both sides nourished the boldest hopes and put forth their\r\nutmost strength for the war, this was only natural. Zeal is always at\r\nits height at the commencement of an undertaking; and on this\r\nparticular occasion Peloponnese and Athens were both full of young men\r\nwhose inexperience made them eager to take up arms, while the rest of\r\nHellas stood straining with excitement at the conflict of its leading\r\ncities. Everywhere predictions were being recited and oracles being\r\nchanted by such persons as collect them, and this not only in the\r\ncontending cities. Further, some while before this, there was an\r\nearthquake at Delos, for the first time in the memory of the Hellenes.\r\nThis was said and thought to be ominous of the events impending;\r\nindeed, nothing of the kind that happened was allowed to pass without\r\nremark. The good wishes of men made greatly for the Lacedaemonians,\r\nespecially as they proclaimed themselves the liberators of Hellas. No\r\nprivate or public effort that could help them in speech or action was\r\nomitted; each thinking that the cause suffered wherever he could not\r\nhimself see to it. So general was the indignation felt against Athens,\r\nwhether by those who wished to escape from her empire, or were\r\napprehensive of being absorbed by it. Such were the preparations and\r\nsuch the feelings with which the contest opened.\r\n\r\nThe allies of the two belligerents were the following. These were the\r\nallies of Lacedaemon: all the Peloponnesians within the Isthmus except\r\nthe Argives and Achaeans, who were neutral; Pellene being the only\r\nAchaean city that first joined in the war, though her example was\r\nafterwards followed by the rest. Outside Peloponnese the Megarians,\r\nLocrians, Boeotians, Phocians, Ambraciots, Leucadians, and Anactorians.\r\nOf these, ships were furnished by the Corinthians, Megarians,\r\nSicyonians, Pellenians, Eleans, Ambraciots, and Leucadians; and cavalry\r\nby the Boeotians, Phocians, and Locrians. The other states sent\r\ninfantry. This was the Lacedaemonian confederacy. That of Athens\r\ncomprised the Chians, Lesbians, Plataeans, the Messenians in Naupactus,\r\nmost of the Acarnanians, the Corcyraeans, Zacynthians, and some\r\ntributary cities in the following countries, viz., Caria upon the sea\r\nwith her Dorian neighbours, Ionia, the Hellespont, the Thracian towns,\r\nthe islands lying between Peloponnese and Crete towards the east, and\r\nall the Cyclades except Melos and Thera. Of these, ships were furnished\r\nby Chios, Lesbos, and Corcyra, infantry and money by the rest. Such\r\nwere the allies of either party and their resources for the war.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the affair at Plataea, Lacedaemon sent round orders\r\nto the cities in Peloponnese and the rest of her confederacy to prepare\r\ntroops and the provisions requisite for a foreign campaign, in order to\r\ninvade Attica. The several states were ready at the time appointed and\r\nassembled at the Isthmus: the contingent of each city being two-thirds\r\nof its whole force. After the whole army had mustered, the\r\nLacedaemonian king, Archidamus, the leader of the expedition, called\r\ntogether the generals of all the states and the principal persons and\r\nofficers, and exhorted them as follows:\r\n\r\n“Peloponnesians and allies, our fathers made many campaigns both within\r\nand without Peloponnese, and the elder men among us here are not\r\nwithout experience in war. Yet we have never set out with a larger\r\nforce than the present; and if our numbers and efficiency are\r\nremarkable, so also is the power of the state against which we march.\r\nWe ought not then to show ourselves inferior to our ancestors, or\r\nunequal to our own reputation. For the hopes and attention of all\r\nHellas are bent upon the present effort, and its sympathy is with the\r\nenemy of the hated Athens. Therefore, numerous as the invading army may\r\nappear to be, and certain as some may think it that our adversary will\r\nnot meet us in the field, this is no sort of justification for the\r\nleast negligence upon the march; but the officers and men of each\r\nparticular city should always be prepared for the advent of danger in\r\ntheir own quarters. The course of war cannot be foreseen, and its\r\nattacks are generally dictated by the impulse of the moment; and where\r\noverweening self-confidence has despised preparation, a wise\r\napprehension often been able to make head against superior numbers. Not\r\nthat confidence is out of place in an army of invasion, but in an\r\nenemy’s country it should also be accompanied by the precautions of\r\napprehension: troops will by this combination be best inspired for\r\ndealing a blow, and best secured against receiving one. In the present\r\ninstance, the city against which we are going, far from being so\r\nimpotent for defence, is on the contrary most excellently equipped at\r\nall points; so that we have every reason to expect that they will take\r\nthe field against us, and that if they have not set out already before\r\nwe are there, they will certainly do so when they see us in their\r\nterritory wasting and destroying their property. For men are always\r\nexasperated at suffering injuries to which they are not accustomed, and\r\non seeing them inflicted before their very eyes; and where least\r\ninclined for reflection, rush with the greatest heat to action. The\r\nAthenians are the very people of all others to do this, as they aspire\r\nto rule the rest of the world, and are more in the habit of invading\r\nand ravaging their neighbours’ territory, than of seeing their own\r\ntreated in the like fashion. Considering, therefore, the power of the\r\nstate against which we are marching, and the greatness of the\r\nreputation which, according to the event, we shall win or lose for our\r\nancestors and ourselves, remember as you follow where you may be led to\r\nregard discipline and vigilance as of the first importance, and to obey\r\nwith alacrity the orders transmitted to you; as nothing contributes so\r\nmuch to the credit and safety of an army as the union of large bodies\r\nby a single discipline.”\r\n\r\nWith this brief speech dismissing the assembly, Archidamus first sent\r\noff Melesippus, son of Diacritus, a Spartan, to Athens, in case she\r\nshould be more inclined to submit on seeing the Peloponnesians actually\r\non the march. But the Athenians did not admit into the city or to their\r\nassembly, Pericles having already carried a motion against admitting\r\neither herald or embassy from the Lacedaemonians after they had once\r\nmarched out.\r\n\r\nThe herald was accordingly sent away without an audience, and ordered\r\nto be beyond the frontier that same day; in future, if those who sent\r\nhim had a proposition to make, they must retire to their own territory\r\nbefore they dispatched embassies to Athens. An escort was sent with\r\nMelesippus to prevent his holding communication with any one. When he\r\nreached the frontier and was just going to be dismissed, he departed\r\nwith these words: “This day will be the beginning of great misfortunes\r\nto the Hellenes.” As soon as he arrived at the camp, and Archidamus\r\nlearnt that the Athenians had still no thoughts of submitting, he at\r\nlength began his march, and advanced with his army into their\r\nterritory. Meanwhile the Boeotians, sending their contingent and\r\ncavalry to join the Peloponnesian expedition, went to Plataea with the\r\nremainder and laid waste the country.\r\n\r\nWhile the Peloponnesians were still mustering at the Isthmus, or on the\r\nmarch before they invaded Attica, Pericles, son of Xanthippus, one of\r\nthe ten generals of the Athenians, finding that the invasion was to\r\ntake place, conceived the idea that Archidamus, who happened to be his\r\nfriend, might possibly pass by his estate without ravaging it. This he\r\nmight do, either from a personal wish to oblige him, or acting under\r\ninstructions from Lacedaemon for the purpose of creating a prejudice\r\nagainst him, as had been before attempted in the demand for the\r\nexpulsion of the accursed family. He accordingly took the precaution of\r\nannouncing to the Athenians in the assembly that, although Archidamus\r\nwas his friend, yet this friendship should not extend to the detriment\r\nof the state, and that in case the enemy should make his houses and\r\nlands an exception to the rest and not pillage them, he at once gave\r\nthem up to be public property, so that they should not bring him into\r\nsuspicion. He also gave the citizens some advice on their present\r\naffairs in the same strain as before. They were to prepare for the war,\r\nand to carry in their property from the country. They were not to go\r\nout to battle, but to come into the city and guard it, and get ready\r\ntheir fleet, in which their real strength lay. They were also to keep a\r\ntight rein on their allies—the strength of Athens being derived from\r\nthe money brought in by their payments, and success in war depending\r\nprincipally upon conduct and capital, had no reason to despond. Apart\r\nfrom other sources of income, an average revenue of six hundred talents\r\nof silver was drawn from the tribute of the allies; and there were\r\nstill six thousand talents of coined silver in the Acropolis, out of\r\nnine thousand seven hundred that had once been there, from which the\r\nmoney had been taken for the porch of the Acropolis, the other public\r\nbuildings, and for Potidæa. This did not include the uncoined gold and\r\nsilver in public and private offerings, the sacred vessels for the\r\nprocessions and games, the Median spoils, and similar resources to the\r\namount of five hundred talents. To this he added the treasures of the\r\nother temples. These were by no means inconsiderable, and might fairly\r\nbe used. Nay, if they were ever absolutely driven to it, they might\r\ntake even the gold ornaments of Athene herself; for the statue\r\ncontained forty talents of pure gold and it was all removable. This\r\nmight be used for self-preservation, and must every penny of it be\r\nrestored. Such was their financial position—surely a satisfactory one.\r\nThen they had an army of thirteen thousand heavy infantry, besides\r\nsixteen thousand more in the garrisons and on home duty at Athens. This\r\nwas at first the number of men on guard in the event of an invasion: it\r\nwas composed of the oldest and youngest levies and the resident aliens\r\nwho had heavy armour. The Phaleric wall ran for four miles, before it\r\njoined that round the city; and of this last nearly five had a guard,\r\nalthough part of it was left without one, viz., that between the Long\r\nWall and the Phaleric. Then there were the Long Walls to Piraeus, a\r\ndistance of some four miles and a half, the outer of which was manned.\r\nLastly, the circumference of Piraeus with Munychia was nearly seven\r\nmiles and a half; only half of this, however, was guarded. Pericles\r\nalso showed them that they had twelve hundred horse including mounted\r\narchers, with sixteen hundred archers unmounted, and three hundred\r\ngalleys fit for service. Such were the resources of Athens in the\r\ndifferent departments when the Peloponnesian invasion was impending and\r\nhostilities were being commenced. Pericles also urged his usual\r\narguments for expecting a favourable issue to the war.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians listened to his advice, and began to carry in their wives\r\nand children from the country, and all their household furniture, even\r\nto the woodwork of their houses which they took down. Their sheep and\r\ncattle they sent over to Euboea and the adjacent islands. But they\r\nfound it hard to move, as most of them had been always used to live in\r\nthe country.\r\n\r\nFrom very early times this had been more the case with the Athenians\r\nthan with others. Under Cecrops and the first kings, down to the reign\r\nof Theseus, Attica had always consisted of a number of independent\r\ntownships, each with its own town hall and magistrates. Except in times\r\nof danger the king at Athens was not consulted; in ordinary seasons\r\nthey carried on their government and settled their affairs without his\r\ninterference; sometimes even they waged war against him, as in the case\r\nof the Eleusinians with Eumolpus against Erechtheus. In Theseus,\r\nhowever, they had a king of equal intelligence and power; and one of\r\nthe chief features in his organization of the country was to abolish\r\nthe council-chambers and magistrates of the petty cities, and to merge\r\nthem in the single council-chamber and town hall of the present\r\ncapital. Individuals might still enjoy their private property just as\r\nbefore, but they were henceforth compelled to have only one political\r\ncentre, viz., Athens; which thus counted all the inhabitants of Attica\r\namong her citizens, so that when Theseus died he left a great state\r\nbehind him. Indeed, from him dates the Synoecia, or Feast of Union;\r\nwhich is paid for by the state, and which the Athenians still keep in\r\nhonour of the goddess. Before this the city consisted of the present\r\ncitadel and the district beneath it looking rather towards the south.\r\nThis is shown by the fact that the temples of the other deities,\r\nbesides that of Athene, are in the citadel; and even those that are\r\noutside it are mostly situated in this quarter of the city, as that of\r\nthe Olympian Zeus, of the Pythian Apollo, of Earth, and of Dionysus in\r\nthe Marshes, the same in whose honour the older Dionysia are to this\r\nday celebrated in the month of Anthesterion not only by the Athenians\r\nbut also by their Ionian descendants. There are also other ancient\r\ntemples in this quarter. The fountain too, which, since the alteration\r\nmade by the tyrants, has been called Enneacrounos, or Nine Pipes, but\r\nwhich, when the spring was open, went by the name of Callirhoe, or\r\nFairwater, was in those days, from being so near, used for the most\r\nimportant offices. Indeed, the old fashion of using the water before\r\nmarriage and for other sacred purposes is still kept up. Again, from\r\ntheir old residence in that quarter, the citadel is still known among\r\nAthenians as the city.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians thus long lived scattered over Attica in independent\r\ntownships. Even after the centralization of Theseus, old habit still\r\nprevailed; and from the early times down to the present war most\r\nAthenians still lived in the country with their families and\r\nhouseholds, and were consequently not at all inclined to move now,\r\nespecially as they had only just restored their establishments after\r\nthe Median invasion. Deep was their trouble and discontent at\r\nabandoning their houses and the hereditary temples of the ancient\r\nconstitution, and at having to change their habits of life and to bid\r\nfarewell to what each regarded as his native city.\r\n\r\nWhen they arrived at Athens, though a few had houses of their own to go\r\nto, or could find an asylum with friends or relatives, by far the\r\ngreater number had to take up their dwelling in the parts of the city\r\nthat were not built over and in the temples and chapels of the heroes,\r\nexcept the Acropolis and the temple of the Eleusinian Demeter and such\r\nother Places as were always kept closed. The occupation of the plot of\r\nground lying below the citadel called the Pelasgian had been forbidden\r\nby a curse; and there was also an ominous fragment of a Pythian oracle\r\nwhich said:\r\n\r\nLeave the Pelasgian parcel desolate, Woe worth the day that men inhabit\r\nit!\r\n\r\nYet this too was now built over in the necessity of the moment. And in\r\nmy opinion, if the oracle proved true, it was in the opposite sense to\r\nwhat was expected. For the misfortunes of the state did not arise from\r\nthe unlawful occupation, but the necessity of the occupation from the\r\nwar; and though the god did not mention this, he foresaw that it would\r\nbe an evil day for Athens in which the plot came to be inhabited. Many\r\nalso took up their quarters in the towers of the walls or wherever else\r\nthey could. For when they were all come in, the city proved too small\r\nto hold them; though afterwards they divided the Long Walls and a great\r\npart of Piraeus into lots and settled there. All this while great\r\nattention was being given to the war; the allies were being mustered,\r\nand an armament of a hundred ships equipped for Peloponnese. Such was\r\nthe state of preparation at Athens.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the army of the Peloponnesians was advancing. The first town\r\nthey came to in Attica was Oenoe, where they to enter the country.\r\nSitting down before it, they prepared to assault the wall with engines\r\nand otherwise. Oenoe, standing upon the Athenian and Boeotian border,\r\nwas of course a walled town, and was used as a fortress by the\r\nAthenians in time of war. So the Peloponnesians prepared for their\r\nassault, and wasted some valuable time before the place. This delay\r\nbrought the gravest censure upon Archidamus. Even during the levying of\r\nthe war he had credit for weakness and Athenian sympathies by the half\r\nmeasures he had advocated; and after the army had assembled he had\r\nfurther injured himself in public estimation by his loitering at the\r\nIsthmus and the slowness with which the rest of the march had been\r\nconducted. But all this was as nothing to the delay at Oenoe. During\r\nthis interval the Athenians were carrying in their property; and it was\r\nthe belief of the Peloponnesians that a quick advance would have found\r\neverything still out, had it not been for his procrastination. Such was\r\nthe feeling of the army towards Archidamus during the siege. But he, it\r\nis said, expected that the Athenians would shrink from letting their\r\nland be wasted, and would make their submission while it was still\r\nuninjured; and this was why he waited.\r\n\r\nBut after he had assaulted Oenoe, and every possible attempt to take it\r\nhad failed, as no herald came from Athens, he at last broke up his camp\r\nand invaded Attica. This was about eighty days after the Theban attempt\r\nupon Plataea, just in the middle of summer, when the corn was ripe, and\r\nArchidamus, son of Zeuxis, king of Lacedaemon, was in command.\r\nEncamping in Eleusis and the Thriasian plain, they began their ravages,\r\nand putting to flight some Athenian horse at a place called Rheiti, or\r\nthe Brooks, they then advanced, keeping Mount Aegaleus on their right,\r\nthrough Cropia, until they reached Acharnae, the largest of the\r\nAthenian demes or townships. Sitting down before it, they formed a camp\r\nthere, and continued their ravages for a long while.\r\n\r\nThe reason why Archidamus remained in order of battle at Acharnae\r\nduring this incursion, instead of descending into the plain, is said to\r\nhave been this. He hoped that the Athenians might possibly be tempted\r\nby the multitude of their youth and the unprecedented efficiency of\r\ntheir service to come out to battle and attempt to stop the devastation\r\nof their lands. Accordingly, as they had met him at Eleusis or the\r\nThriasian plain, he tried if they could be provoked to a sally by the\r\nspectacle of a camp at Acharnae. He thought the place itself a good\r\nposition for encamping; and it seemed likely that such an important\r\npart of the state as the three thousand heavy infantry of the\r\nAcharnians would refuse to submit to the ruin of their property, and\r\nwould force a battle on the rest of the citizens. On the other hand,\r\nshould the Athenians not take the field during this incursion, he could\r\nthen fearlessly ravage the plain in future invasions, and extend his\r\nadvance up to the very walls of Athens. After the Acharnians had lost\r\ntheir own property they would be less willing to risk themselves for\r\nthat of their neighbours; and so there would be division in the\r\nAthenian counsels. These were the motives of Archidamus for remaining\r\nat Acharnae.\r\n\r\nIn the meanwhile, as long as the army was at Eleusis and the Thriasian\r\nplain, hopes were still entertained of its not advancing any nearer. It\r\nwas remembered that Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, king of Lacedaemon,\r\nhad invaded Attica with a Peloponnesian army fourteen years before, but\r\nhad retreated without advancing farther than Eleusis and Thria, which\r\nindeed proved the cause of his exile from Sparta, as it was thought he\r\nhad been bribed to retreat. But when they saw the army at Acharnae,\r\nbarely seven miles from Athens, they lost all patience. The territory\r\nof Athens was being ravaged before the very eyes of the Athenians, a\r\nsight which the young men had never seen before and the old only in the\r\nMedian wars; and it was naturally thought a grievous insult, and the\r\ndetermination was universal, especially among the young men, to sally\r\nforth and stop it. Knots were formed in the streets and engaged in hot\r\ndiscussion; for if the proposed sally was warmly recommended, it was\r\nalso in some cases opposed. Oracles of the most various import were\r\nrecited by the collectors, and found eager listeners in one or other of\r\nthe disputants. Foremost in pressing for the sally were the Acharnians,\r\nas constituting no small part of the army of the state, and as it was\r\ntheir land that was being ravaged. In short, the whole city was in a\r\nmost excited state; Pericles was the object of general indignation; his\r\nprevious counsels were totally forgotten; he was abused for not leading\r\nout the army which he commanded, and was made responsible for the whole\r\nof the public suffering.\r\n\r\nHe, meanwhile, seeing anger and infatuation just now in the ascendant,\r\nand of his wisdom in refusing a sally, would not call either assembly\r\nor meeting of the people, fearing the fatal results of a debate\r\ninspired by passion and not by prudence. Accordingly he addressed\r\nhimself to the defence of the city, and kept it as quiet as possible,\r\nthough he constantly sent out cavalry to prevent raids on the lands\r\nnear the city from flying parties of the enemy. There was a trifling\r\naffair at Phrygia between a squadron of the Athenian horse with the\r\nThessalians and the Boeotian cavalry; in which the former had rather\r\nthe best of it, until the heavy infantry advanced to the support of the\r\nBoeotians, when the Thessalians and Athenians were routed and lost a\r\nfew men, whose bodies, however, were recovered the same day without a\r\ntruce. The next day the Peloponnesians set up a trophy. Ancient\r\nalliance brought the Thessalians to the aid of Athens; those who came\r\nbeing the Larisaeans, Pharsalians, Cranonians, Pyrasians, Gyrtonians,\r\nand Pheraeans. The Larisaean commanders were Polymedes and Aristonus,\r\ntwo party leaders in Larisa; the Pharsalian general was Menon; each of\r\nthe other cities had also its own commander.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Peloponnesians, as the Athenians did not come out\r\nto engage them, broke up from Acharnae and ravaged some of the demes\r\nbetween Mount Parnes and Brilessus. While they were in Attica the\r\nAthenians sent off the hundred ships which they had been preparing\r\nround Peloponnese, with a thousand heavy infantry and four hundred\r\narchers on board, under the command of Carcinus, son of Xenotimus,\r\nProteas, son of Epicles, and Socrates, son of Antigenes. This armament\r\nweighed anchor and started on its cruise, and the Peloponnesians, after\r\nremaining in Attica as long as their provisions lasted, retired through\r\nBoeotia by a different road to that by which they had entered. As they\r\npassed Oropus they ravaged the territory of Graea, which is held by the\r\nOropians from Athens, and reaching Peloponnese broke up to their\r\nrespective cities.\r\n\r\nAfter they had retired the Athenians set guards by land and sea at the\r\npoints at which they intended to have regular stations during the war.\r\nThey also resolved to set apart a special fund of a thousand talents\r\nfrom the moneys in the Acropolis. This was not to be spent, but the\r\ncurrent expenses of the war were to be otherwise provided for. If any\r\none should move or put to the vote a proposition for using the money\r\nfor any purpose whatever except that of defending the city in the event\r\nof the enemy bringing a fleet to make an attack by sea, it should be a\r\ncapital offence. With this sum of money they also set aside a special\r\nfleet of one hundred galleys, the best ships of each year, with their\r\ncaptains. None of these were to be used except with the money and\r\nagainst the same peril, should such peril arise.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians in the hundred ships round Peloponnese,\r\nreinforced by a Corcyraean squadron of fifty vessels and some others of\r\nthe allies in those parts, cruised about the coasts and ravaged the\r\ncountry. Among other places they landed in Laconia and made an assault\r\nupon Methone; there being no garrison in the place, and the wall being\r\nweak. But it so happened that Brasidas, son of Tellis, a Spartan, was\r\nin command of a guard for the defence of the district. Hearing of the\r\nattack, he hurried with a hundred heavy infantry to the assistance of\r\nthe besieged, and dashing through the army of the Athenians, which was\r\nscattered over the country and had its attention turned to the wall,\r\nthrew himself into Methone. He lost a few men in making good his\r\nentrance, but saved the place and won the thanks of Sparta by his\r\nexploit, being thus the first officer who obtained this notice during\r\nthe war. The Athenians at once weighed anchor and continued their\r\ncruise. Touching at Pheia in Elis, they ravaged the country for two\r\ndays and defeated a picked force of three hundred men that had come\r\nfrom the vale of Elis and the immediate neighbourhood to the rescue.\r\nBut a stiff squall came down upon them, and, not liking to face it in a\r\nplace where there was no harbour, most of them got on board their\r\nships, and doubling Point Ichthys sailed into the port of Pheia. In the\r\nmeantime the Messenians, and some others who could not get on board,\r\nmarched over by land and took Pheia. The fleet afterwards sailed round\r\nand picked them up and then put to sea; Pheia being evacuated, as the\r\nmain army of the Eleans had now come up. The Athenians continued their\r\ncruise, and ravaged other places on the coast.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Athenians sent thirty ships to cruise round\r\nLocris and also to guard Euboea; Cleopompus, son of Clinias, being in\r\ncommand. Making descents from the fleet he ravaged certain places on\r\nthe sea-coast, and captured Thronium and took hostages from it. He also\r\ndefeated at Alope the Locrians that had assembled to resist him.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer the Athenians also expelled the Aeginetans with their\r\nwives and children from Aegina, on the ground of their having been the\r\nchief agents in bringing the war upon them. Besides, Aegina lies so\r\nnear Peloponnese that it seemed safer to send colonists of their own to\r\nhold it, and shortly afterwards the settlers were sent out. The\r\nbanished Aeginetans found an asylum in Thyrea, which was given to them\r\nby Lacedaemon, not only on account of her quarrel with Athens, but also\r\nbecause the Aeginetans had laid her under obligations at the time of\r\nthe earthquake and the revolt of the Helots. The territory of Thyrea is\r\non the frontier of Argolis and Laconia, reaching down to the sea. Those\r\nof the Aeginetans who did not settle here were scattered over the rest\r\nof Hellas.\r\n\r\nThe same summer, at the beginning of a new lunar month, the only time\r\nby the way at which it appears possible, the sun was eclipsed after\r\nnoon. After it had assumed the form of a crescent and some of the stars\r\nhad come out, it returned to its natural shape.\r\n\r\nDuring the same summer Nymphodorus, son of Pythes, an Abderite, whose\r\nsister Sitalces had married, was made their proxenus by the Athenians\r\nand sent for to Athens. They had hitherto considered him their enemy;\r\nbut he had great influence with Sitalces, and they wished this prince\r\nto become their ally. Sitalces was the son of Teres and King of the\r\nThracians. Teres, the father of Sitalces, was the first to establish\r\nthe great kingdom of the Odrysians on a scale quite unknown to the rest\r\nof Thrace, a large portion of the Thracians being independent. This\r\nTeres is in no way related to Tereus who married Pandion’s daughter\r\nProcne from Athens; nor indeed did they belong to the same part of\r\nThrace. Tereus lived in Daulis, part of what is now called Phocis, but\r\nwhich at that time was inhabited by Thracians. It was in this land that\r\nthe women perpetrated the outrage upon Itys; and many of the poets when\r\nthey mention the nightingale call it the Daulian bird. Besides, Pandion\r\nin contracting an alliance for his daughter would consider the\r\nadvantages of mutual assistance, and would naturally prefer a match at\r\nthe above moderate distance to the journey of many days which separates\r\nAthens from the Odrysians. Again the names are different; and this\r\nTeres was king of the Odrysians, the first by the way who attained to\r\nany power. Sitalces, his son, was now sought as an ally by the\r\nAthenians, who desired his aid in the reduction of the Thracian towns\r\nand of Perdiccas. Coming to Athens, Nymphodorus concluded the alliance\r\nwith Sitalces and made his son Sadocus an Athenian citizen, and\r\npromised to finish the war in Thrace by persuading Sitalces to send the\r\nAthenians a force of Thracian horse and targeteers. He also reconciled\r\nthem with Perdiccas, and induced them to restore Therme to him; upon\r\nwhich Perdiccas at once joined the Athenians and Phormio in an\r\nexpedition against the Chalcidians. Thus Sitalces, son of Teres, King\r\nof the Thracians, and Perdiccas, son of Alexander, King of the\r\nMacedonians, became allies of Athens.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians in the hundred vessels were still cruising\r\nround Peloponnese. After taking Sollium, a town belonging to Corinth,\r\nand presenting the city and territory to the Acarnanians of Palaira,\r\nthey stormed Astacus, expelled its tyrant Evarchus, and gained the\r\nplace for their confederacy. Next they sailed to the island of\r\nCephallenia and brought it over without using force. Cephallenia lies\r\noff Acarnania and Leucas, and consists of four states, the Paleans,\r\nCranians, Samaeans, and Pronaeans. Not long afterwards the fleet\r\nreturned to Athens. Towards the autumn of this year the Athenians\r\ninvaded the Megarid with their whole levy, resident aliens included,\r\nunder the command of Pericles, son of Xanthippus. The Athenians in the\r\nhundred ships round Peloponnese on their journey home had just reached\r\nAegina, and hearing that the citizens at home were in full force at\r\nMegara, now sailed over and joined them. This was without doubt the\r\nlargest army of Athenians ever assembled, the state being still in the\r\nflower of her strength and yet unvisited by the plague. Full ten\r\nthousand heavy infantry were in the field, all Athenian citizens,\r\nbesides the three thousand before Potidæa. Then the resident aliens who\r\njoined in the incursion were at least three thousand strong; besides\r\nwhich there was a multitude of light troops. They ravaged the greater\r\npart of the territory, and then retired. Other incursions into the\r\nMegarid were afterwards made by the Athenians annually during the war,\r\nsometimes only with cavalry, sometimes with all their forces. This went\r\non until the capture of Nisaea. Atalanta also, the desert island off\r\nthe Opuntian coast, was towards the end of this summer converted into a\r\nfortified post by the Athenians, in order to prevent privateers issuing\r\nfrom Opus and the rest of Locris and plundering Euboea. Such were the\r\nevents of this summer after the return of the Peloponnesians from\r\nAttica.\r\n\r\nIn the ensuing winter the Acarnanian Evarchus, wishing to return to\r\nAstacus, persuaded the Corinthians to sail over with forty ships and\r\nfifteen hundred heavy infantry and restore him; himself also hiring\r\nsome mercenaries. In command of the force were Euphamidas, son of\r\nAristonymus, Timoxenus, son of Timocrates, and Eumachus, son of\r\nChrysis, who sailed over and restored him and, after failing in an\r\nattempt on some places on the Acarnanian coast which they were desirous\r\nof gaining, began their voyage home. Coasting along shore they touched\r\nat Cephallenia and made a descent on the Cranian territory, and losing\r\nsome men by the treachery of the Cranians, who fell suddenly upon them\r\nafter having agreed to treat, put to sea somewhat hurriedly and\r\nreturned home.\r\n\r\nIn the same winter the Athenians gave a funeral at the public cost to\r\nthose who had first fallen in this war. It was a custom of their\r\nancestors, and the manner of it is as follows. Three days before the\r\nceremony, the bones of the dead are laid out in a tent which has been\r\nerected; and their friends bring to their relatives such offerings as\r\nthey please. In the funeral procession cypress coffins are borne in\r\ncars, one for each tribe; the bones of the deceased being placed in the\r\ncoffin of their tribe. Among these is carried one empty bier decked for\r\nthe missing, that is, for those whose bodies could not be recovered.\r\nAny citizen or stranger who pleases, joins in the procession: and the\r\nfemale relatives are there to wail at the burial. The dead are laid in\r\nthe public sepulchre in the Beautiful suburb of the city, in which\r\nthose who fall in war are always buried; with the exception of those\r\nslain at Marathon, who for their singular and extraordinary valour were\r\ninterred on the spot where they fell. After the bodies have been laid\r\nin the earth, a man chosen by the state, of approved wisdom and eminent\r\nreputation, pronounces over them an appropriate panegyric; after which\r\nall retire. Such is the manner of the burying; and throughout the whole\r\nof the war, whenever the occasion arose, the established custom was\r\nobserved. Meanwhile these were the first that had fallen, and Pericles,\r\nson of Xanthippus, was chosen to pronounce their eulogium. When the\r\nproper time arrived, he advanced from the sepulchre to an elevated\r\nplatform in order to be heard by as many of the crowd as possible, and\r\nspoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“Most of my predecessors in this place have commended him who made this\r\nspeech part of the law, telling us that it is well that it should be\r\ndelivered at the burial of those who fall in battle. For myself, I\r\nshould have thought that the worth which had displayed itself in deeds\r\nwould be sufficiently rewarded by honours also shown by deeds; such as\r\nyou now see in this funeral prepared at the people’s cost. And I could\r\nhave wished that the reputations of many brave men were not to be\r\nimperilled in the mouth of a single individual, to stand or fall\r\naccording as he spoke well or ill. For it is hard to speak properly\r\nupon a subject where it is even difficult to convince your hearers that\r\nyou are speaking the truth. On the one hand, the friend who is familiar\r\nwith every fact of the story may think that some point has not been set\r\nforth with that fullness which he wishes and knows it to deserve; on\r\nthe other, he who is a stranger to the matter may be led by envy to\r\nsuspect exaggeration if he hears anything above his own nature. For men\r\ncan endure to hear others praised only so long as they can severally\r\npersuade themselves of their own ability to equal the actions\r\nrecounted: when this point is passed, envy comes in and with it\r\nincredulity. However, since our ancestors have stamped this custom with\r\ntheir approval, it becomes my duty to obey the law and to try to\r\nsatisfy your several wishes and opinions as best I may.\r\n\r\n“I shall begin with our ancestors: it is both just and proper that they\r\nshould have the honour of the first mention on an occasion like the\r\npresent. They dwelt in the country without break in the succession from\r\ngeneration to generation, and handed it down free to the present time\r\nby their valour. And if our more remote ancestors deserve praise, much\r\nmore do our own fathers, who added to their inheritance the empire\r\nwhich we now possess, and spared no pains to be able to leave their\r\nacquisitions to us of the present generation. Lastly, there are few\r\nparts of our dominions that have not been augmented by those of us\r\nhere, who are still more or less in the vigour of life; while the\r\nmother country has been furnished by us with everything that can enable\r\nher to depend on her own resources whether for war or for peace. That\r\npart of our history which tells of the military achievements which gave\r\nus our several possessions, or of the ready valour with which either we\r\nor our fathers stemmed the tide of Hellenic or foreign aggression, is a\r\ntheme too familiar to my hearers for me to dilate on, and I shall\r\ntherefore pass it by. But what was the road by which we reached our\r\nposition, what the form of government under which our greatness grew,\r\nwhat the national habits out of which it sprang; these are questions\r\nwhich I may try to solve before I proceed to my panegyric upon these\r\nmen; since I think this to be a subject upon which on the present\r\noccasion a speaker may properly dwell, and to which the whole\r\nassemblage, whether citizens or foreigners, may listen with advantage.\r\n\r\n“Our constitution does not copy the laws of neighbouring states; we are\r\nrather a pattern to others than imitators ourselves. Its administration\r\nfavours the many instead of the few; this is why it is called a\r\ndemocracy. If we look to the laws, they afford equal justice to all in\r\ntheir private differences; if no social standing, advancement in public\r\nlife falls to reputation for capacity, class considerations not being\r\nallowed to interfere with merit; nor again does poverty bar the way, if\r\na man is able to serve the state, he is not hindered by the obscurity\r\nof his condition. The freedom which we enjoy in our government extends\r\nalso to our ordinary life. There, far from exercising a jealous\r\nsurveillance over each other, we do not feel called upon to be angry\r\nwith our neighbour for doing what he likes, or even to indulge in those\r\ninjurious looks which cannot fail to be offensive, although they\r\ninflict no positive penalty. But all this ease in our private relations\r\ndoes not make us lawless as citizens. Against this fear is our chief\r\nsafeguard, teaching us to obey the magistrates and the laws,\r\nparticularly such as regard the protection of the injured, whether they\r\nare actually on the statute book, or belong to that code which,\r\nalthough unwritten, yet cannot be broken without acknowledged disgrace.\r\n\r\n“Further, we provide plenty of means for the mind to refresh itself\r\nfrom business. We celebrate games and sacrifices all the year round,\r\nand the elegance of our private establishments forms a daily source of\r\npleasure and helps to banish the spleen; while the magnitude of our\r\ncity draws the produce of the world into our harbour, so that to the\r\nAthenian the fruits of other countries are as familiar a luxury as\r\nthose of his own.\r\n\r\n“If we turn to our military policy, there also we differ from our\r\nantagonists. We throw open our city to the world, and never by alien\r\nacts exclude foreigners from any opportunity of learning or observing,\r\nalthough the eyes of an enemy may occasionally profit by our\r\nliberality; trusting less in system and policy than to the native\r\nspirit of our citizens; while in education, where our rivals from their\r\nvery cradles by a painful discipline seek after manliness, at Athens we\r\nlive exactly as we please, and yet are just as ready to encounter every\r\nlegitimate danger. In proof of this it may be noticed that the\r\nLacedaemonians do not invade our country alone, but bring with them all\r\ntheir confederates; while we Athenians advance unsupported into the\r\nterritory of a neighbour, and fighting upon a foreign soil usually\r\nvanquish with ease men who are defending their homes. Our united force\r\nwas never yet encountered by any enemy, because we have at once to\r\nattend to our marine and to dispatch our citizens by land upon a\r\nhundred different services; so that, wherever they engage with some\r\nsuch fraction of our strength, a success against a detachment is\r\nmagnified into a victory over the nation, and a defeat into a reverse\r\nsuffered at the hands of our entire people. And yet if with habits not\r\nof labour but of ease, and courage not of art but of nature, we are\r\nstill willing to encounter danger, we have the double advantage of\r\nescaping the experience of hardships in anticipation and of facing them\r\nin the hour of need as fearlessly as those who are never free from\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Nor are these the only points in which our city is worthy of\r\nadmiration. We cultivate refinement without extravagance and knowledge\r\nwithout effeminacy; wealth we employ more for use than for show, and\r\nplace the real disgrace of poverty not in owning to the fact but in\r\ndeclining the struggle against it. Our public men have, besides\r\npolitics, their private affairs to attend to, and our ordinary\r\ncitizens, though occupied with the pursuits of industry, are still fair\r\njudges of public matters; for, unlike any other nation, regarding him\r\nwho takes no part in these duties not as unambitious but as useless, we\r\nAthenians are able to judge at all events if we cannot originate, and,\r\ninstead of looking on discussion as a stumbling-block in the way of\r\naction, we think it an indispensable preliminary to any wise action at\r\nall. Again, in our enterprises we present the singular spectacle of\r\ndaring and deliberation, each carried to its highest point, and both\r\nunited in the same persons; although usually decision is the fruit of\r\nignorance, hesitation of reflection. But the palm of courage will\r\nsurely be adjudged most justly to those, who best know the difference\r\nbetween hardship and pleasure and yet are never tempted to shrink from\r\ndanger. In generosity we are equally singular, acquiring our friends by\r\nconferring, not by receiving, favours. Yet, of course, the doer of the\r\nfavour is the firmer friend of the two, in order by continued kindness\r\nto keep the recipient in his debt; while the debtor feels less keenly\r\nfrom the very consciousness that the return he makes will be a payment,\r\nnot a free gift. And it is only the Athenians, who, fearless of\r\nconsequences, confer their benefits not from calculations of\r\nexpediency, but in the confidence of liberality.\r\n\r\n“In short, I say that as a city we are the school of Hellas, while I\r\ndoubt if the world can produce a man who, where he has only himself to\r\ndepend upon, is equal to so many emergencies, and graced by so happy a\r\nversatility, as the Athenian. And that this is no mere boast thrown out\r\nfor the occasion, but plain matter of fact, the power of the state\r\nacquired by these habits proves. For Athens alone of her contemporaries\r\nis found when tested to be greater than her reputation, and alone gives\r\nno occasion to her assailants to blush at the antagonist by whom they\r\nhave been worsted, or to her subjects to question her title by merit to\r\nrule. Rather, the admiration of the present and succeeding ages will be\r\nours, since we have not left our power without witness, but have shown\r\nit by mighty proofs; and far from needing a Homer for our panegyrist,\r\nor other of his craft whose verses might charm for the moment only for\r\nthe impression which they gave to melt at the touch of fact, we have\r\nforced every sea and land to be the highway of our daring, and\r\neverywhere, whether for evil or for good, have left imperishable\r\nmonuments behind us. Such is the Athens for which these men, in the\r\nassertion of their resolve not to lose her, nobly fought and died; and\r\nwell may every one of their survivors be ready to suffer in her cause.\r\n\r\n“Indeed if I have dwelt at some length upon the character of our\r\ncountry, it has been to show that our stake in the struggle is not the\r\nsame as theirs who have no such blessings to lose, and also that the\r\npanegyric of the men over whom I am now speaking might be by definite\r\nproofs established. That panegyric is now in a great measure complete;\r\nfor the Athens that I have celebrated is only what the heroism of these\r\nand their like have made her, men whose fame, unlike that of most\r\nHellenes, will be found to be only commensurate with their deserts. And\r\nif a test of worth be wanted, it is to be found in their closing scene,\r\nand this not only in cases in which it set the final seal upon their\r\nmerit, but also in those in which it gave the first intimation of their\r\nhaving any. For there is justice in the claim that steadfastness in his\r\ncountry’s battles should be as a cloak to cover a man’s other\r\nimperfections; since the good action has blotted out the bad, and his\r\nmerit as a citizen more than outweighed his demerits as an individual.\r\nBut none of these allowed either wealth with its prospect of future\r\nenjoyment to unnerve his spirit, or poverty with its hope of a day of\r\nfreedom and riches to tempt him to shrink from danger. No, holding that\r\nvengeance upon their enemies was more to be desired than any personal\r\nblessings, and reckoning this to be the most glorious of hazards, they\r\njoyfully determined to accept the risk, to make sure of their\r\nvengeance, and to let their wishes wait; and while committing to hope\r\nthe uncertainty of final success, in the business before them they\r\nthought fit to act boldly and trust in themselves. Thus choosing to die\r\nresisting, rather than to live submitting, they fled only from\r\ndishonour, but met danger face to face, and after one brief moment,\r\nwhile at the summit of their fortune, escaped, not from their fear, but\r\nfrom their glory.\r\n\r\n“So died these men as became Athenians. You, their survivors, must\r\ndetermine to have as unfaltering a resolution in the field, though you\r\nmay pray that it may have a happier issue. And not contented with ideas\r\nderived only from words of the advantages which are bound up with the\r\ndefence of your country, though these would furnish a valuable text to\r\na speaker even before an audience so alive to them as the present, you\r\nmust yourselves realize the power of Athens, and feed your eyes upon\r\nher from day to day, till love of her fills your hearts; and then, when\r\nall her greatness shall break upon you, you must reflect that it was by\r\ncourage, sense of duty, and a keen feeling of honour in action that men\r\nwere enabled to win all this, and that no personal failure in an\r\nenterprise could make them consent to deprive their country of their\r\nvalour, but they laid it at her feet as the most glorious contribution\r\nthat they could offer. For this offering of their lives made in common\r\nby them all they each of them individually received that renown which\r\nnever grows old, and for a sepulchre, not so much that in which their\r\nbones have been deposited, but that noblest of shrines wherein their\r\nglory is laid up to be eternally remembered upon every occasion on\r\nwhich deed or story shall call for its commemoration. For heroes have\r\nthe whole earth for their tomb; and in lands far from their own, where\r\nthe column with its epitaph declares it, there is enshrined in every\r\nbreast a record unwritten with no tablet to preserve it, except that of\r\nthe heart. These take as your model and, judging happiness to be the\r\nfruit of freedom and freedom of valour, never decline the dangers of\r\nwar. For it is not the miserable that would most justly be unsparing of\r\ntheir lives; these have nothing to hope for: it is rather they to whom\r\ncontinued life may bring reverses as yet unknown, and to whom a fall,\r\nif it came, would be most tremendous in its consequences. And surely,\r\nto a man of spirit, the degradation of cowardice must be immeasurably\r\nmore grievous than the unfelt death which strikes him in the midst of\r\nhis strength and patriotism!\r\n\r\n“Comfort, therefore, not condolence, is what I have to offer to the\r\nparents of the dead who may be here. Numberless are the chances to\r\nwhich, as they know, the life of man is subject; but fortunate indeed\r\nare they who draw for their lot a death so glorious as that which has\r\ncaused your mourning, and to whom life has been so exactly measured as\r\nto terminate in the happiness in which it has been passed. Still I know\r\nthat this is a hard saying, especially when those are in question of\r\nwhom you will constantly be reminded by seeing in the homes of others\r\nblessings of which once you also boasted: for grief is felt not so much\r\nfor the want of what we have never known, as for the loss of that to\r\nwhich we have been long accustomed. Yet you who are still of an age to\r\nbeget children must bear up in the hope of having others in their\r\nstead; not only will they help you to forget those whom you have lost,\r\nbut will be to the state at once a reinforcement and a security; for\r\nnever can a fair or just policy be expected of the citizen who does\r\nnot, like his fellows, bring to the decision the interests and\r\napprehensions of a father. While those of you who have passed your\r\nprime must congratulate yourselves with the thought that the best part\r\nof your life was fortunate, and that the brief span that remains will\r\nbe cheered by the fame of the departed. For it is only the love of\r\nhonour that never grows old; and honour it is, not gain, as some would\r\nhave it, that rejoices the heart of age and helplessness.\r\n\r\n“Turning to the sons or brothers of the dead, I see an arduous struggle\r\nbefore you. When a man is gone, all are wont to praise him, and should\r\nyour merit be ever so transcendent, you will still find it difficult\r\nnot merely to overtake, but even to approach their renown. The living\r\nhave envy to contend with, while those who are no longer in our path\r\nare honoured with a goodwill into which rivalry does not enter. On the\r\nother hand, if I must say anything on the subject of female excellence\r\nto those of you who will now be in widowhood, it will be all comprised\r\nin this brief exhortation. Great will be your glory in not falling\r\nshort of your natural character; and greatest will be hers who is least\r\ntalked of among the men, whether for good or for bad.\r\n\r\n“My task is now finished. I have performed it to the best of my\r\nability, and in word, at least, the requirements of the law are now\r\nsatisfied. If deeds be in question, those who are here interred have\r\nreceived part of their honours already, and for the rest, their\r\nchildren will be brought up till manhood at the public expense: the\r\nstate thus offers a valuable prize, as the garland of victory in this\r\nrace of valour, for the reward both of those who have fallen and their\r\nsurvivors. And where the rewards for merit are greatest, there are\r\nfound the best citizens.\r\n\r\n“And now that you have brought to a close your lamentations for your\r\nrelatives, you may depart.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n\r\nSecond Year of the War—The Plague of Athens—Position and Policy of\r\nPericles—Fall of Potidæa\r\n\r\n\r\nSuch was the funeral that took place during this winter, with which the\r\nfirst year of the war came to an end. In the first days of summer the\r\nLacedaemonians and their allies, with two-thirds of their forces as\r\nbefore, invaded Attica, under the command of Archidamus, son of\r\nZeuxidamus, King of Lacedaemon, and sat down and laid waste the\r\ncountry. Not many days after their arrival in Attica the plague first\r\nbegan to show itself among the Athenians. It was said that it had\r\nbroken out in many places previously in the neighbourhood of Lemnos and\r\nelsewhere; but a pestilence of such extent and mortality was nowhere\r\nremembered. Neither were the physicians at first of any service,\r\nignorant as they were of the proper way to treat it, but they died\r\nthemselves the most thickly, as they visited the sick most often; nor\r\ndid any human art succeed any better. Supplications in the temples,\r\ndivinations, and so forth were found equally futile, till the\r\noverwhelming nature of the disaster at last put a stop to them\r\naltogether.\r\n\r\nIt first began, it is said, in the parts of Ethiopia above Egypt, and\r\nthence descended into Egypt and Libya and into most of the King’s\r\ncountry. Suddenly falling upon Athens, it first attacked the population\r\nin Piraeus—which was the occasion of their saying that the\r\nPeloponnesians had poisoned the reservoirs, there being as yet no wells\r\nthere—and afterwards appeared in the upper city, when the deaths became\r\nmuch more frequent. All speculation as to its origin and its causes, if\r\ncauses can be found adequate to produce so great a disturbance, I leave\r\nto other writers, whether lay or professional; for myself, I shall\r\nsimply set down its nature, and explain the symptoms by which perhaps\r\nit may be recognized by the student, if it should ever break out again.\r\nThis I can the better do, as I had the disease myself, and watched its\r\noperation in the case of others.\r\n\r\nThat year then is admitted to have been otherwise unprecedentedly free\r\nfrom sickness; and such few cases as occurred all determined in this.\r\nAs a rule, however, there was no ostensible cause; but people in good\r\nhealth were all of a sudden attacked by violent heats in the head, and\r\nredness and inflammation in the eyes, the inward parts, such as the\r\nthroat or tongue, becoming bloody and emitting an unnatural and fetid\r\nbreath. These symptoms were followed by sneezing and hoarseness, after\r\nwhich the pain soon reached the chest, and produced a hard cough. When\r\nit fixed in the stomach, it upset it; and discharges of bile of every\r\nkind named by physicians ensued, accompanied by very great distress. In\r\nmost cases also an ineffectual retching followed, producing violent\r\nspasms, which in some cases ceased soon after, in others much later.\r\nExternally the body was not very hot to the touch, nor pale in its\r\nappearance, but reddish, livid, and breaking out into small pustules\r\nand ulcers. But internally it burned so that the patient could not bear\r\nto have on him clothing or linen even of the very lightest description;\r\nor indeed to be otherwise than stark naked. What they would have liked\r\nbest would have been to throw themselves into cold water; as indeed was\r\ndone by some of the neglected sick, who plunged into the rain-tanks in\r\ntheir agonies of unquenchable thirst; though it made no difference\r\nwhether they drank little or much. Besides this, the miserable feeling\r\nof not being able to rest or sleep never ceased to torment them. The\r\nbody meanwhile did not waste away so long as the distemper was at its\r\nheight, but held out to a marvel against its ravages; so that when they\r\nsuccumbed, as in most cases, on the seventh or eighth day to the\r\ninternal inflammation, they had still some strength in them. But if\r\nthey passed this stage, and the disease descended further into the\r\nbowels, inducing a violent ulceration there accompanied by severe\r\ndiarrhoea, this brought on a weakness which was generally fatal. For\r\nthe disorder first settled in the head, ran its course from thence\r\nthrough the whole of the body, and, even where it did not prove mortal,\r\nit still left its mark on the extremities; for it settled in the privy\r\nparts, the fingers and the toes, and many escaped with the loss of\r\nthese, some too with that of their eyes. Others again were seized with\r\nan entire loss of memory on their first recovery, and did not know\r\neither themselves or their friends.\r\n\r\nBut while the nature of the distemper was such as to baffle all\r\ndescription, and its attacks almost too grievous for human nature to\r\nendure, it was still in the following circumstance that its difference\r\nfrom all ordinary disorders was most clearly shown. All the birds and\r\nbeasts that prey upon human bodies, either abstained from touching them\r\n(though there were many lying unburied), or died after tasting them. In\r\nproof of this, it was noticed that birds of this kind actually\r\ndisappeared; they were not about the bodies, or indeed to be seen at\r\nall. But of course the effects which I have mentioned could best be\r\nstudied in a domestic animal like the dog.\r\n\r\nSuch then, if we pass over the varieties of particular cases which were\r\nmany and peculiar, were the general features of the distemper.\r\nMeanwhile the town enjoyed an immunity from all the ordinary disorders;\r\nor if any case occurred, it ended in this. Some died in neglect, others\r\nin the midst of every attention. No remedy was found that could be used\r\nas a specific; for what did good in one case, did harm in another.\r\nStrong and weak constitutions proved equally incapable of resistance,\r\nall alike being swept away, although dieted with the utmost precaution.\r\nBy far the most terrible feature in the malady was the dejection which\r\nensued when any one felt himself sickening, for the despair into which\r\nthey instantly fell took away their power of resistance, and left them\r\na much easier prey to the disorder; besides which, there was the awful\r\nspectacle of men dying like sheep, through having caught the infection\r\nin nursing each other. This caused the greatest mortality. On the one\r\nhand, if they were afraid to visit each other, they perished from\r\nneglect; indeed many houses were emptied of their inmates for want of a\r\nnurse: on the other, if they ventured to do so, death was the\r\nconsequence. This was especially the case with such as made any\r\npretensions to goodness: honour made them unsparing of themselves in\r\ntheir attendance in their friends’ houses, where even the members of\r\nthe family were at last worn out by the moans of the dying, and\r\nsuccumbed to the force of the disaster. Yet it was with those who had\r\nrecovered from the disease that the sick and the dying found most\r\ncompassion. These knew what it was from experience, and had now no fear\r\nfor themselves; for the same man was never attacked twice—never at\r\nleast fatally. And such persons not only received the congratulations\r\nof others, but themselves also, in the elation of the moment, half\r\nentertained the vain hope that they were for the future safe from any\r\ndisease whatsoever.\r\n\r\nAn aggravation of the existing calamity was the influx from the country\r\ninto the city, and this was especially felt by the new arrivals. As\r\nthere were no houses to receive them, they had to be lodged at the hot\r\nseason of the year in stifling cabins, where the mortality raged\r\nwithout restraint. The bodies of dying men lay one upon another, and\r\nhalf-dead creatures reeled about the streets and gathered round all the\r\nfountains in their longing for water. The sacred places also in which\r\nthey had quartered themselves were full of corpses of persons that had\r\ndied there, just as they were; for as the disaster passed all bounds,\r\nmen, not knowing what was to become of them, became utterly careless of\r\neverything, whether sacred or profane. All the burial rites before in\r\nuse were entirely upset, and they buried the bodies as best they could.\r\nMany from want of the proper appliances, through so many of their\r\nfriends having died already, had recourse to the most shameless\r\nsepultures: sometimes getting the start of those who had raised a pile,\r\nthey threw their own dead body upon the stranger’s pyre and ignited it;\r\nsometimes they tossed the corpse which they were carrying on the top of\r\nanother that was burning, and so went off.\r\n\r\nNor was this the only form of lawless extravagance which owed its\r\norigin to the plague. Men now coolly ventured on what they had formerly\r\ndone in a corner, and not just as they pleased, seeing the rapid\r\ntransitions produced by persons in prosperity suddenly dying and those\r\nwho before had nothing succeeding to their property. So they resolved\r\nto spend quickly and enjoy themselves, regarding their lives and riches\r\nas alike things of a day. Perseverance in what men called honour was\r\npopular with none, it was so uncertain whether they would be spared to\r\nattain the object; but it was settled that present enjoyment, and all\r\nthat contributed to it, was both honourable and useful. Fear of gods or\r\nlaw of man there was none to restrain them. As for the first, they\r\njudged it to be just the same whether they worshipped them or not, as\r\nthey saw all alike perishing; and for the last, no one expected to live\r\nto be brought to trial for his offences, but each felt that a far\r\nseverer sentence had been already passed upon them all and hung ever\r\nover their heads, and before this fell it was only reasonable to enjoy\r\nlife a little.\r\n\r\nSuch was the nature of the calamity, and heavily did it weigh on the\r\nAthenians; death raging within the city and devastation without. Among\r\nother things which they remembered in their distress was, very\r\nnaturally, the following verse which the old men said had long ago been\r\nuttered:\r\n\r\nA Dorian war shall come and with it death.\r\n\r\n\r\nSo a dispute arose as to whether dearth and not death had not been the\r\nword in the verse; but at the present juncture, it was of course\r\ndecided in favour of the latter; for the people made their recollection\r\nfit in with their sufferings. I fancy, however, that if another Dorian\r\nwar should ever afterwards come upon us, and a dearth should happen to\r\naccompany it, the verse will probably be read accordingly. The oracle\r\nalso which had been given to the Lacedaemonians was now remembered by\r\nthose who knew of it. When the god was asked whether they should go to\r\nwar, he answered that if they put their might into it, victory would be\r\ntheirs, and that he would himself be with them. With this oracle events\r\nwere supposed to tally. For the plague broke out as soon as the\r\nPeloponnesians invaded Attica, and never entering Peloponnese (not at\r\nleast to an extent worth noticing), committed its worst ravages at\r\nAthens, and next to Athens, at the most populous of the other towns.\r\nSuch was the history of the plague.\r\n\r\nAfter ravaging the plain, the Peloponnesians advanced into the Paralian\r\nregion as far as Laurium, where the Athenian silver mines are, and\r\nfirst laid waste the side looking towards Peloponnese, next that which\r\nfaces Euboea and Andros. But Pericles, who was still general, held the\r\nsame opinion as in the former invasion, and would not let the Athenians\r\nmarch out against them.\r\n\r\nHowever, while they were still in the plain, and had not yet entered\r\nthe Paralian land, he had prepared an armament of a hundred ships for\r\nPeloponnese, and when all was ready put out to sea. On board the ships\r\nhe took four thousand Athenian heavy infantry, and three hundred\r\ncavalry in horse transports, and then for the first time made out of\r\nold galleys; fifty Chian and Lesbian vessels also joining in the\r\nexpedition. When this Athenian armament put out to sea, they left the\r\nPeloponnesians in Attica in the Paralian region. Arriving at Epidaurus\r\nin Peloponnese they ravaged most of the territory, and even had hopes\r\nof taking the town by an assault: in this however they were not\r\nsuccessful. Putting out from Epidaurus, they laid waste the territory\r\nof Troezen, Halieis, and Hermione, all towns on the coast of\r\nPeloponnese, and thence sailing to Prasiai, a maritime town in Laconia,\r\nravaged part of its territory, and took and sacked the place itself;\r\nafter which they returned home, but found the Peloponnesians gone and\r\nno longer in Attica.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole time that the Peloponnesians were in Attica and the\r\nAthenians on the expedition in their ships, men kept dying of the\r\nplague both in the armament and in Athens. Indeed it was actually\r\nasserted that the departure of the Peloponnesians was hastened by fear\r\nof the disorder; as they heard from deserters that it was in the city,\r\nand also could see the burials going on. Yet in this invasion they\r\nremained longer than in any other, and ravaged the whole country, for\r\nthey were about forty days in Attica.\r\n\r\nThe same summer Hagnon, son of Nicias, and Cleopompus, son of Clinias,\r\nthe colleagues of Pericles, took the armament of which he had lately\r\nmade use, and went off upon an expedition against the Chalcidians in\r\nthe direction of Thrace and Potidæa, which was still under siege. As\r\nsoon as they arrived, they brought up their engines against Potidæa and\r\ntried every means of taking it, but did not succeed either in capturing\r\nthe city or in doing anything else worthy of their preparations. For\r\nthe plague attacked them here also, and committed such havoc as to\r\ncripple them completely, even the previously healthy soldiers of the\r\nformer expedition catching the infection from Hagnon’s troops; while\r\nPhormio and the sixteen hundred men whom he commanded only escaped by\r\nbeing no longer in the neighbourhood of the Chalcidians. The end of it\r\nwas that Hagnon returned with his ships to Athens, having lost one\r\nthousand and fifty out of four thousand heavy infantry in about forty\r\ndays; though the soldiers stationed there before remained in the\r\ncountry and carried on the siege of Potidæa.\r\n\r\nAfter the second invasion of the Peloponnesians a change came over the\r\nspirit of the Athenians. Their land had now been twice laid waste; and\r\nwar and pestilence at once pressed heavy upon them. They began to find\r\nfault with Pericles, as the author of the war and the cause of all\r\ntheir misfortunes, and became eager to come to terms with Lacedaemon,\r\nand actually sent ambassadors thither, who did not however succeed in\r\ntheir mission. Their despair was now complete and all vented itself\r\nupon Pericles. When he saw them exasperated at the present turn of\r\naffairs and acting exactly as he had anticipated, he called an\r\nassembly, being (it must be remembered) still general, with the double\r\nobject of restoring confidence and of leading them from these angry\r\nfeelings to a calmer and more hopeful state of mind. He accordingly\r\ncame forward and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“I was not unprepared for the indignation of which I have been the\r\nobject, as I know its causes; and I have called an assembly for the\r\npurpose of reminding you upon certain points, and of protesting against\r\nyour being unreasonably irritated with me, or cowed by your sufferings.\r\nI am of opinion that national greatness is more for the advantage of\r\nprivate citizens, than any individual well-being coupled with public\r\nhumiliation. A man may be personally ever so well off, and yet if his\r\ncountry be ruined he must be ruined with it; whereas a flourishing\r\ncommonwealth always affords chances of salvation to unfortunate\r\nindividuals. Since then a state can support the misfortunes of private\r\ncitizens, while they cannot support hers, it is surely the duty of\r\nevery one to be forward in her defence, and not like you to be so\r\nconfounded with your domestic afflictions as to give up all thoughts of\r\nthe common safety, and to blame me for having counselled war and\r\nyourselves for having voted it. And yet if you are angry with me, it is\r\nwith one who, as I believe, is second to no man either in knowledge of\r\nthe proper policy, or in the ability to expound it, and who is moreover\r\nnot only a patriot but an honest one. A man possessing that knowledge\r\nwithout that faculty of exposition might as well have no idea at all on\r\nthe matter: if he had both these gifts, but no love for his country, he\r\nwould be but a cold advocate for her interests; while were his\r\npatriotism not proof against bribery, everything would go for a price.\r\nSo that if you thought that I was even moderately distinguished for\r\nthese qualities when you took my advice and went to war, there is\r\ncertainly no reason now why I should be charged with having done wrong.\r\n\r\n“For those of course who have a free choice in the matter and whose\r\nfortunes are not at stake, war is the greatest of follies. But if the\r\nonly choice was between submission with loss of independence, and\r\ndanger with the hope of preserving that independence, in such a case it\r\nis he who will not accept the risk that deserves blame, not he who\r\nwill. I am the same man and do not alter, it is you who change, since\r\nin fact you took my advice while unhurt, and waited for misfortune to\r\nrepent of it; and the apparent error of my policy lies in the infirmity\r\nof your resolution, since the suffering that it entails is being felt\r\nby every one among you, while its advantage is still remote and obscure\r\nto all, and a great and sudden reverse having befallen you, your mind\r\nis too much depressed to persevere in your resolves. For before what is\r\nsudden, unexpected, and least within calculation, the spirit quails;\r\nand putting all else aside, the plague has certainly been an emergency\r\nof this kind. Born, however, as you are, citizens of a great state, and\r\nbrought up, as you have been, with habits equal to your birth, you\r\nshould be ready to face the greatest disasters and still to keep\r\nunimpaired the lustre of your name. For the judgment of mankind is as\r\nrelentless to the weakness that falls short of a recognized renown, as\r\nit is jealous of the arrogance that aspires higher than its due. Cease\r\nthen to grieve for your private afflictions, and address yourselves\r\ninstead to the safety of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\n“If you shrink before the exertions which the war makes necessary, and\r\nfear that after all they may not have a happy result, you know the\r\nreasons by which I have often demonstrated to you the groundlessness of\r\nyour apprehensions. If those are not enough, I will now reveal an\r\nadvantage arising from the greatness of your dominion, which I think\r\nhas never yet suggested itself to you, which I never mentioned in my\r\nprevious speeches, and which has so bold a sound that I should scarce\r\nadventure it now, were it not for the unnatural depression which I see\r\naround me. You perhaps think that your empire extends only over your\r\nallies; I will declare to you the truth. The visible field of action\r\nhas two parts, land and sea. In the whole of one of these you are\r\ncompletely supreme, not merely as far as you use it at present, but\r\nalso to what further extent you may think fit: in fine, your naval\r\nresources are such that your vessels may go where they please, without\r\nthe King or any other nation on earth being able to stop them. So that\r\nalthough you may think it a great privation to lose the use of your\r\nland and houses, still you must see that this power is something widely\r\ndifferent; and instead of fretting on their account, you should really\r\nregard them in the light of the gardens and other accessories that\r\nembellish a great fortune, and as, in comparison, of little moment. You\r\nshould know too that liberty preserved by your efforts will easily\r\nrecover for us what we have lost, while, the knee once bowed, even what\r\nyou have will pass from you. Your fathers receiving these possessions\r\nnot from others, but from themselves, did not let slip what their\r\nlabour had acquired, but delivered them safe to you; and in this\r\nrespect at least you must prove yourselves their equals, remembering\r\nthat to lose what one has got is more disgraceful than to be balked in\r\ngetting, and you must confront your enemies not merely with spirit but\r\nwith disdain. Confidence indeed a blissful ignorance can impart, ay,\r\neven to a coward’s breast, but disdain is the privilege of those who,\r\nlike us, have been assured by reflection of their superiority to their\r\nadversary. And where the chances are the same, knowledge fortifies\r\ncourage by the contempt which is its consequence, its trust being\r\nplaced, not in hope, which is the prop of the desperate, but in a\r\njudgment grounded upon existing resources, whose anticipations are more\r\nto be depended upon.\r\n\r\n“Again, your country has a right to your services in sustaining the\r\nglories of her position. These are a common source of pride to you all,\r\nand you cannot decline the burdens of empire and still expect to share\r\nits honours. You should remember also that what you are fighting\r\nagainst is not merely slavery as an exchange for independence, but also\r\nloss of empire and danger from the animosities incurred in its\r\nexercise. Besides, to recede is no longer possible, if indeed any of\r\nyou in the alarm of the moment has become enamoured of the honesty of\r\nsuch an unambitious part. For what you hold is, to speak somewhat\r\nplainly, a tyranny; to take it perhaps was wrong, but to let it go is\r\nunsafe. And men of these retiring views, making converts of others,\r\nwould quickly ruin a state; indeed the result would be the same if they\r\ncould live independent by themselves; for the retiring and unambitious\r\nare never secure without vigorous protectors at their side; in fine,\r\nsuch qualities are useless to an imperial city, though they may help a\r\ndependency to an unmolested servitude.\r\n\r\n“But you must not be seduced by citizens like these or angry with\r\nme—who, if I voted for war, only did as you did yourselves—in spite of\r\nthe enemy having invaded your country and done what you could be\r\ncertain that he would do, if you refused to comply with his demands;\r\nand although besides what we counted for, the plague has come upon\r\nus—the only point indeed at which our calculation has been at fault. It\r\nis this, I know, that has had a large share in making me more unpopular\r\nthan I should otherwise have been—quite undeservedly, unless you are\r\nalso prepared to give me the credit of any success with which chance\r\nmay present you. Besides, the hand of heaven must be borne with\r\nresignation, that of the enemy with fortitude; this was the old way at\r\nAthens, and do not you prevent it being so still. Remember, too, that\r\nif your country has the greatest name in all the world, it is because\r\nshe never bent before disaster; because she has expended more life and\r\neffort in war than any other city, and has won for herself a power\r\ngreater than any hitherto known, the memory of which will descend to\r\nthe latest posterity; even if now, in obedience to the general law of\r\ndecay, we should ever be forced to yield, still it will be remembered\r\nthat we held rule over more Hellenes than any other Hellenic state,\r\nthat we sustained the greatest wars against their united or separate\r\npowers, and inhabited a city unrivalled by any other in resources or\r\nmagnitude. These glories may incur the censure of the slow and\r\nunambitious; but in the breast of energy they will awake emulation, and\r\nin those who must remain without them an envious regret. Hatred and\r\nunpopularity at the moment have fallen to the lot of all who have\r\naspired to rule others; but where odium must be incurred, true wisdom\r\nincurs it for the highest objects. Hatred also is short-lived; but that\r\nwhich makes the splendour of the present and the glory of the future\r\nremains for ever unforgotten. Make your decision, therefore, for glory\r\nthen and honour now, and attain both objects by instant and zealous\r\neffort: do not send heralds to Lacedaemon, and do not betray any sign\r\nof being oppressed by your present sufferings, since they whose minds\r\nare least sensitive to calamity, and whose hands are most quick to meet\r\nit, are the greatest men and the greatest communities.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the arguments by which Pericles tried to cure the Athenians\r\nof their anger against him and to divert their thoughts from their\r\nimmediate afflictions. As a community he succeeded in convincing them;\r\nthey not only gave up all idea of sending to Lacedaemon, but applied\r\nthemselves with increased energy to the war; still as private\r\nindividuals they could not help smarting under their sufferings, the\r\ncommon people having been deprived of the little that they were\r\npossessed, while the higher orders had lost fine properties with costly\r\nestablishments and buildings in the country, and, worst of all, had war\r\ninstead of peace. In fact, the public feeling against him did not\r\nsubside until he had been fined. Not long afterwards, however,\r\naccording to the way of the multitude, they again elected him general\r\nand committed all their affairs to his hands, having now become less\r\nsensitive to their private and domestic afflictions, and understanding\r\nthat he was the best man of all for the public necessities. For as long\r\nas he was at the head of the state during the peace, he pursued a\r\nmoderate and conservative policy; and in his time its greatness was at\r\nits height. When the war broke out, here also he seems to have rightly\r\ngauged the power of his country. He outlived its commencement two years\r\nand six months, and the correctness of his previsions respecting it\r\nbecame better known by his death. He told them to wait quietly, to pay\r\nattention to their marine, to attempt no new conquests, and to expose\r\nthe city to no hazards during the war, and doing this, promised them a\r\nfavourable result. What they did was the very contrary, allowing\r\nprivate ambitions and private interests, in matters apparently quite\r\nforeign to the war, to lead them into projects unjust both to\r\nthemselves and to their allies—projects whose success would only\r\nconduce to the honour and advantage of private persons, and whose\r\nfailure entailed certain disaster on the country in the war. The causes\r\nof this are not far to seek. Pericles indeed, by his rank, ability, and\r\nknown integrity, was enabled to exercise an independent control over\r\nthe multitude—in short, to lead them instead of being led by them; for\r\nas he never sought power by improper means, he was never compelled to\r\nflatter them, but, on the contrary, enjoyed so high an estimation that\r\nhe could afford to anger them by contradiction. Whenever he saw them\r\nunseasonably and insolently elated, he would with a word reduce them to\r\nalarm; on the other hand, if they fell victims to a panic, he could at\r\nonce restore them to confidence. In short, what was nominally a\r\ndemocracy became in his hands government by the first citizen. With his\r\nsuccessors it was different. More on a level with one another, and each\r\ngrasping at supremacy, they ended by committing even the conduct of\r\nstate affairs to the whims of the multitude. This, as might have been\r\nexpected in a great and sovereign state, produced a host of blunders,\r\nand amongst them the Sicilian expedition; though this failed not so\r\nmuch through a miscalculation of the power of those against whom it was\r\nsent, as through a fault in the senders in not taking the best measures\r\nafterwards to assist those who had gone out, but choosing rather to\r\noccupy themselves with private cabals for the leadership of the\r\ncommons, by which they not only paralysed operations in the field, but\r\nalso first introduced civil discord at home. Yet after losing most of\r\ntheir fleet besides other forces in Sicily, and with faction already\r\ndominant in the city, they could still for three years make head\r\nagainst their original adversaries, joined not only by the Sicilians,\r\nbut also by their own allies nearly all in revolt, and at last by the\r\nKing’s son, Cyrus, who furnished the funds for the Peloponnesian navy.\r\nNor did they finally succumb till they fell the victims of their own\r\nintestine disorders. So superfluously abundant were the resources from\r\nwhich the genius of Pericles foresaw an easy triumph in the war over\r\nthe unaided forces of the Peloponnesians.\r\n\r\nDuring the same summer the Lacedaemonians and their allies made an\r\nexpedition with a hundred ships against Zacynthus, an island lying off\r\nthe coast of Elis, peopled by a colony of Achaeans from Peloponnese,\r\nand in alliance with Athens. There were a thousand Lacedaemonian heavy\r\ninfantry on board, and Cnemus, a Spartan, as admiral. They made a\r\ndescent from their ships, and ravaged most of the country; but as the\r\ninhabitants would not submit, they sailed back home.\r\n\r\nAt the end of the same summer the Corinthian Aristeus, Aneristus,\r\nNicolaus, and Stratodemus, envoys from Lacedaemon, Timagoras, a Tegean,\r\nand a private individual named Pollis from Argos, on their way to Asia\r\nto persuade the King to supply funds and join in the war, came to\r\nSitalces, son of Teres in Thrace, with the idea of inducing him, if\r\npossible, to forsake the alliance of Athens and to march on Potidæa\r\nthen besieged by an Athenian force, and also of getting conveyed by his\r\nmeans to their destination across the Hellespont to Pharnabazus, who\r\nwas to send them up the country to the King. But there chanced to be\r\nwith Sitalces some Athenian ambassadors—Learchus, son of Callimachus,\r\nand Ameiniades, son of Philemon—who persuaded Sitalces’ son, Sadocus,\r\nthe new Athenian citizen, to put the men into their hands and thus\r\nprevent their crossing over to the King and doing their part to injure\r\nthe country of his choice. He accordingly had them seized, as they were\r\ntravelling through Thrace to the vessel in which they were to cross the\r\nHellespont, by a party whom he had sent on with Learchus and\r\nAmeiniades, and gave orders for their delivery to the Athenian\r\nambassadors, by whom they were brought to Athens. On their arrival, the\r\nAthenians, afraid that Aristeus, who had been notably the prime mover\r\nin the previous affairs of Potidæa and their Thracian possessions,\r\nmight live to do them still more mischief if he escaped, slew them all\r\nthe same day, without giving them a trial or hearing the defence which\r\nthey wished to offer, and cast their bodies into a pit; thinking\r\nthemselves justified in using in retaliation the same mode of warfare\r\nwhich the Lacedaemonians had begun, when they slew and cast into pits\r\nall the Athenian and allied traders whom they caught on board the\r\nmerchantmen round Peloponnese. Indeed, at the outset of the war, the\r\nLacedaemonians butchered as enemies all whom they took on the sea,\r\nwhether allies of Athens or neutrals.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time towards the close of the summer, the Ambraciot\r\nforces, with a number of barbarians that they had raised, marched\r\nagainst the Amphilochian Argos and the rest of that country. The origin\r\nof their enmity against the Argives was this. This Argos and the rest\r\nof Amphilochia were colonized by Amphilochus, son of Amphiaraus.\r\nDissatisfied with the state of affairs at home on his return thither\r\nafter the Trojan War, he built this city in the Ambracian Gulf, and\r\nnamed it Argos after his own country. This was the largest town in\r\nAmphilochia, and its inhabitants the most powerful. Under the pressure\r\nof misfortune many generations afterwards, they called in the\r\nAmbraciots, their neighbours on the Amphilochian border, to join their\r\ncolony; and it was by this union with the Ambraciots that they learnt\r\ntheir present Hellenic speech, the rest of the Amphilochians being\r\nbarbarians. After a time the Ambraciots expelled the Argives and held\r\nthe city themselves. Upon this the Amphilochians gave themselves over\r\nto the Acarnanians; and the two together called the Athenians, who sent\r\nthem Phormio as general and thirty ships; upon whose arrival they took\r\nArgos by storm, and made slaves of the Ambraciots; and the\r\nAmphilochians and Acarnanians inhabited the town in common. After this\r\nbegan the alliance between the Athenians and Acarnanians. The enmity of\r\nthe Ambraciots against the Argives thus commenced with the enslavement\r\nof their citizens; and afterwards during the war they collected this\r\narmament among themselves and the Chaonians, and other of the\r\nneighbouring barbarians. Arrived before Argos, they became masters of\r\nthe country; but not being successful in their attacks upon the town,\r\nreturned home and dispersed among their different peoples.\r\n\r\nSuch were the events of the summer. The ensuing winter the Athenians\r\nsent twenty ships round Peloponnese, under the command of Phormio, who\r\nstationed himself at Naupactus and kept watch against any one sailing\r\nin or out of Corinth and the Crissaean Gulf. Six others went to Caria\r\nand Lycia under Melesander, to collect tribute in those parts, and also\r\nto prevent the Peloponnesian privateers from taking up their station in\r\nthose waters and molesting the passage of the merchantmen from Phaselis\r\nand Phoenicia and the adjoining continent. However, Melesander, going\r\nup the country into Lycia with a force of Athenians from the ships and\r\nthe allies, was defeated and killed in battle, with the loss of a\r\nnumber of his troops.\r\n\r\nThe same winter the Potidæans at length found themselves no longer able\r\nto hold out against their besiegers. The inroads of the Peloponnesians\r\ninto Attica had not had the desired effect of making the Athenians\r\nraise the siege. Provisions there were none left; and so far had\r\ndistress for food gone in Potidæa that, besides a number of other\r\nhorrors, instances had even occurred of the people having eaten one\r\nanother. In this extremity they at last made proposals for capitulating\r\nto the Athenian generals in command against them—Xenophon, son of\r\nEuripides, Hestiodorus, son of Aristocleides, and Phanomachus, son of\r\nCallimachus. The generals accepted their proposals, seeing the\r\nsufferings of the army in so exposed a position; besides which the\r\nstate had already spent two thousand talents upon the siege. The terms\r\nof the capitulation were as follows: a free passage out for themselves,\r\ntheir children, wives and auxiliaries, with one garment apiece, the\r\nwomen with two, and a fixed sum of money for their journey. Under this\r\ntreaty they went out to Chalcidice and other places, according as was\r\ntheir power. The Athenians, however, blamed the generals for granting\r\nterms without instructions from home, being of opinion that the place\r\nwould have had to surrender at discretion. They afterwards sent\r\nsettlers of their own to Potidæa, and colonized it. Such were the\r\nevents of the winter, and so ended the second year of this war of which\r\nThucydides was the historian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\n\r\nThird Year of the War—Investment of Plataea—Naval Victories of\r\nPhormio—Thracian Irruption into Macedonia under Sitalces\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next summer the Peloponnesians and their allies, instead of\r\ninvading Attica, marched against Plataea, under the command of\r\nArchidamus, son of Zeuxidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians. He had\r\nencamped his army and was about to lay waste the country, when the\r\nPlataeans hastened to send envoys to him, and spoke as follows:\r\n“Archidamus and Lacedaemonians, in invading the Plataean territory, you\r\ndo what is wrong in itself, and worthy neither of yourselves nor of the\r\nfathers who begot you. Pausanias, son of Cleombrotus, your countryman,\r\nafter freeing Hellas from the Medes with the help of those Hellenes who\r\nwere willing to undertake the risk of the battle fought near our city,\r\noffered sacrifice to Zeus the Liberator in the marketplace of Plataea,\r\nand calling all the allies together restored to the Plataeans their\r\ncity and territory, and declared it independent and inviolate against\r\naggression or conquest. Should any such be attempted, the allies\r\npresent were to help according to their power. Your fathers rewarded us\r\nthus for the courage and patriotism that we displayed at that perilous\r\nepoch; but you do just the contrary, coming with our bitterest enemies,\r\nthe Thebans, to enslave us. We appeal, therefore, to the gods to whom\r\nthe oaths were then made, to the gods of your ancestors, and lastly to\r\nthose of our country, and call upon you to refrain from violating our\r\nterritory or transgressing the oaths, and to let us live independent,\r\nas Pausanias decreed.”\r\n\r\nThe Plataeans had got thus far when they were cut short by Archidamus\r\nsaying: “There is justice, Plataeans, in what you say, if you act up to\r\nyour words. According, to the grant of Pausanias, continue to be\r\nindependent yourselves, and join in freeing those of your fellow\r\ncountrymen who, after sharing in the perils of that period, joined in\r\nthe oaths to you, and are now subject to the Athenians; for it is to\r\nfree them and the rest that all this provision and war has been made. I\r\ncould wish that you would share our labours and abide by the oaths\r\nyourselves; if this is impossible, do what we have already required of\r\nyou—remain neutral, enjoying your own; join neither side, but receive\r\nboth as friends, neither as allies for the war. With this we shall be\r\nsatisfied.” Such were the words of Archidamus. The Plataeans, after\r\nhearing what he had to say, went into the city and acquainted the\r\npeople with what had passed, and presently returned for answer that it\r\nwas impossible for them to do what he proposed without consulting the\r\nAthenians, with whom their children and wives now were; besides which\r\nthey had their fears for the town. After his departure, what was to\r\nprevent the Athenians from coming and taking it out of their hands, or\r\nthe Thebans, who would be included in the oaths, from taking advantage\r\nof the proposed neutrality to make a second attempt to seize the city?\r\nUpon these points he tried to reassure them by saying: “You have only\r\nto deliver over the city and houses to us Lacedaemonians, to point out\r\nthe boundaries of your land, the number of your fruit-trees, and\r\nwhatever else can be numerically stated, and yourselves to withdraw\r\nwherever you like as long as the war shall last. When it is over we\r\nwill restore to you whatever we received, and in the interim hold it in\r\ntrust and keep it in cultivation, paying you a sufficient allowance.”\r\n\r\nWhen they had heard what he had to say, they re-entered the city, and\r\nafter consulting with the people said that they wished first to\r\nacquaint the Athenians with this proposal, and in the event of their\r\napproving to accede to it; in the meantime they asked him to grant them\r\na truce and not to lay waste their territory. He accordingly granted a\r\ntruce for the number of days requisite for the journey, and meanwhile\r\nabstained from ravaging their territory. The Plataean envoys went to\r\nAthens, and consulted with the Athenians, and returned with the\r\nfollowing message to those in the city: “The Athenians say, Plataeans,\r\nthat they never hitherto, since we became their allies, on any occasion\r\nabandoned us to an enemy, nor will they now neglect us, but will help\r\nus according to their ability; and they adjure you by the oaths which\r\nyour fathers swore, to keep the alliance unaltered.”\r\n\r\nOn the delivery of this message by the envoys, the Plataeans resolved\r\nnot to be unfaithful to the Athenians but to endure, if it must be,\r\nseeing their lands laid waste and any other trials that might come to\r\nthem, and not to send out again, but to answer from the wall that it\r\nwas impossible for them to do as the Lacedaemonians proposed. As soon\r\nas he had received this answer, King Archidamus proceeded first to make\r\na solemn appeal to the gods and heroes of the country in words\r\nfollowing: “Ye gods and heroes of the Plataean territory, be my\r\nwitnesses that not as aggressors originally, nor until these had first\r\ndeparted from the common oath, did we invade this land, in which our\r\nfathers offered you their prayers before defeating the Medes, and which\r\nyou made auspicious to the Hellenic arms; nor shall we be aggressors in\r\nthe measures to which we may now resort, since we have made many fair\r\nproposals but have not been successful. Graciously accord that those\r\nwho were the first to offend may be punished for it, and that vengeance\r\nmay be attained by those who would righteously inflict it.”\r\n\r\nAfter this appeal to the gods Archidamus put his army in motion. First\r\nhe enclosed the town with a palisade formed of the fruit-trees which\r\nthey cut down, to prevent further egress from Plataea; next they threw\r\nup a mound against the city, hoping that the largeness of the force\r\nemployed would ensure the speedy reduction of the place. They\r\naccordingly cut down timber from Cithaeron, and built it up on either\r\nside, laying it like lattice-work to serve as a wall to keep the mound\r\nfrom spreading abroad, and carried to it wood and stones and earth and\r\nwhatever other material might help to complete it. They continued to\r\nwork at the mound for seventy days and nights without intermission,\r\nbeing divided into relief parties to allow of some being employed in\r\ncarrying while others took sleep and refreshment; the Lacedaemonian\r\nofficer attached to each contingent keeping the men to the work. But\r\nthe Plataeans, observing the progress of the mound, constructed a wall\r\nof wood and fixed it upon that part of the city wall against which the\r\nmound was being erected, and built up bricks inside it which they took\r\nfrom the neighbouring houses. The timbers served to bind the building\r\ntogether, and to prevent its becoming weak as it advanced in height; it\r\nhad also a covering of skins and hides, which protected the woodwork\r\nagainst the attacks of burning missiles and allowed the men to work in\r\nsafety. Thus the wall was raised to a great height, and the mound\r\nopposite made no less rapid progress. The Plataeans also thought of\r\nanother expedient; they pulled out part of the wall upon which the\r\nmound abutted, and carried the earth into the city.\r\n\r\nDiscovering this the Peloponnesians twisted up clay in wattles of reed\r\nand threw it into the breach formed in the mound, in order to give it\r\nconsistency and prevent its being carried away like the soil. Stopped\r\nin this way the Plataeans changed their mode of operation, and digging\r\na mine from the town calculated their way under the mound, and began to\r\ncarry off its material as before. This went on for a long while without\r\nthe enemy outside finding it out, so that for all they threw on the top\r\ntheir mound made no progress in proportion, being carried away from\r\nbeneath and constantly settling down in the vacuum. But the Plataeans,\r\nfearing that even thus they might not be able to hold out against the\r\nsuperior numbers of the enemy, had yet another invention. They stopped\r\nworking at the large building in front of the mound, and starting at\r\neither end of it inside from the old low wall, built a new one in the\r\nform of a crescent running in towards the town; in order that in the\r\nevent of the great wall being taken this might remain, and the enemy\r\nhave to throw up a fresh mound against it, and as they advanced within\r\nmight not only have their trouble over again, but also be exposed to\r\nmissiles on their flanks. While raising the mound the Peloponnesians\r\nalso brought up engines against the city, one of which was brought up\r\nupon the mound against the great building and shook down a good piece\r\nof it, to the no small alarm of the Plataeans. Others were advanced\r\nagainst different parts of the wall but were lassoed and broken by the\r\nPlataeans; who also hung up great beams by long iron chains from either\r\nextremity of two poles laid on the wall and projecting over it, and\r\ndrew them up at an angle whenever any point was threatened by the\r\nengine, and loosing their hold let the beam go with its chains slack,\r\nso that it fell with a run and snapped off the nose of the battering\r\nram.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Peloponnesians, finding that their engines effected\r\nnothing, and that their mound was met by the counterwork, concluded\r\nthat their present means of offence were unequal to the taking of the\r\ncity, and prepared for its circumvallation. First, however, they\r\ndetermined to try the effects of fire and see whether they could not,\r\nwith the help of a wind, burn the town, as it was not a large one;\r\nindeed they thought of every possible expedient by which the place\r\nmight be reduced without the expense of a blockade. They accordingly\r\nbrought faggots of brushwood and threw them from the mound, first into\r\nthe space between it and the wall; and this soon becoming full from the\r\nnumber of hands at work, they next heaped the faggots up as far into\r\nthe town as they could reach from the top, and then lighted the wood by\r\nsetting fire to it with sulphur and pitch. The consequence was a fire\r\ngreater than any one had ever yet seen produced by human agency, though\r\nit could not of course be compared to the spontaneous conflagrations\r\nsometimes known to occur through the wind rubbing the branches of a\r\nmountain forest together. And this fire was not only remarkable for its\r\nmagnitude, but was also, at the end of so many perils, within an ace of\r\nproving fatal to the Plataeans; a great part of the town became\r\nentirely inaccessible, and had a wind blown upon it, in accordance with\r\nthe hopes of the enemy, nothing could have saved them. As it was, there\r\nis also a story of heavy rain and thunder having come on by which the\r\nfire was put out and the danger averted.\r\n\r\nFailing in this last attempt the Peloponnesians left a portion of their\r\nforces on the spot, dismissing the rest, and built a wall of\r\ncircumvallation round the town, dividing the ground among the various\r\ncities present; a ditch being made within and without the lines, from\r\nwhich they got their bricks. All being finished by about the rising of\r\nArcturus, they left men enough to man half the wall, the rest being\r\nmanned by the Boeotians, and drawing off their army dispersed to their\r\nseveral cities. The Plataeans had before sent off their wives and\r\nchildren and oldest men and the mass of the non-combatants to Athens;\r\nso that the number of the besieged left in the place comprised four\r\nhundred of their own citizens, eighty Athenians, and a hundred and ten\r\nwomen to bake their bread. This was the sum total at the commencement\r\nof the siege, and there was no one else within the walls, bond or free.\r\nSuch were the arrangements made for the blockade of Plataea.\r\n\r\nThe same summer and simultaneously with the expedition against Plataea,\r\nthe Athenians marched with two thousand heavy infantry and two hundred\r\nhorse against the Chalcidians in the direction of Thrace and the\r\nBottiaeans, just as the corn was getting ripe, under the command of\r\nXenophon, son of Euripides, with two colleagues. Arriving before\r\nSpartolus in Bottiaea, they destroyed the corn and had some hopes of\r\nthe city coming over through the intrigues of a faction within. But\r\nthose of a different way of thinking had sent to Olynthus; and a\r\ngarrison of heavy infantry and other troops arrived accordingly. These\r\nissuing from Spartolus were engaged by the Athenians in front of the\r\ntown: the Chalcidian heavy infantry, and some auxiliaries with them,\r\nwere beaten and retreated into Spartolus; but the Chalcidian horse and\r\nlight troops defeated the horse and light troops of the Athenians. The\r\nChalcidians had already a few targeteers from Crusis, and presently\r\nafter the battle were joined by some others from Olynthus; upon seeing\r\nwhom the light troops from Spartolus, emboldened by this accession and\r\nby their previous success, with the help of the Chalcidian horse and\r\nthe reinforcement just arrived again attacked the Athenians, who\r\nretired upon the two divisions which they had left with their baggage.\r\nWhenever the Athenians advanced, their adversary gave way, pressing\r\nthem with missiles the instant they began to retire. The Chalcidian\r\nhorse also, riding up and charging them just as they pleased, at last\r\ncaused a panic amongst them and routed and pursued them to a great\r\ndistance. The Athenians took refuge in Potidæa, and afterwards\r\nrecovered their dead under truce, and returned to Athens with the\r\nremnant of their army; four hundred and thirty men and all the generals\r\nhaving fallen. The Chalcidians and Bottiaeans set up a trophy, took up\r\ntheir dead, and dispersed to their several cities.\r\n\r\nThe same summer, not long after this, the Ambraciots and Chaonians,\r\nbeing desirous of reducing the whole of Acarnania and detaching it from\r\nAthens, persuaded the Lacedaemonians to equip a fleet from their\r\nconfederacy and send a thousand heavy infantry to Acarnania,\r\nrepresenting that, if a combined movement were made by land and sea,\r\nthe coast Acarnanians would be unable to march, and the conquest of\r\nZacynthus and Cephallenia easily following on the possession of\r\nAcarnania, the cruise round Peloponnese would be no longer so\r\nconvenient for the Athenians. Besides which there was a hope of taking\r\nNaupactus. The Lacedaemonians accordingly at once sent off a few\r\nvessels with Cnemus, who was still high admiral, and the heavy infantry\r\non board; and sent round orders for the fleet to equip as quickly as\r\npossible and sail to Leucas. The Corinthians were the most forward in\r\nthe business; the Ambraciots being a colony of theirs. While the ships\r\nfrom Corinth, Sicyon, and the neighbourhood were getting ready, and\r\nthose from Leucas, Anactorium, and Ambracia, which had arrived before,\r\nwere waiting for them at Leucas, Cnemus and his thousand heavy infantry\r\nhad run into the gulf, giving the slip to Phormio, the commander of the\r\nAthenian squadron stationed off Naupactus, and began at once to prepare\r\nfor the land expedition. The Hellenic troops with him consisted of the\r\nAmbraciots, Leucadians, and Anactorians, and the thousand\r\nPeloponnesians with whom he came; the barbarian of a thousand\r\nChaonians, who, belonging to a nation that has no king, were led by\r\nPhotys and Nicanor, the two members of the royal family to whom the\r\nchieftainship for that year had been confided. With the Chaonians came\r\nalso some Thesprotians, like them without a king, some Molossians and\r\nAtintanians led by Sabylinthus, the guardian of King Tharyps who was\r\nstill a minor, and some Paravaeans, under their king Oroedus,\r\naccompanied by a thousand Orestians, subjects of King Antichus and\r\nplaced by him under the command of Oroedus. There were also a thousand\r\nMacedonians sent by Perdiccas without the knowledge of the Athenians,\r\nbut they arrived too late. With this force Cnemus set out, without\r\nwaiting for the fleet from Corinth. Passing through the territory of\r\nAmphilochian Argos, and sacking the open village of Limnaea, they\r\nadvanced to Stratus the Acarnanian capital; this once taken, the rest\r\nof the country, they felt convinced, would speedily follow.\r\n\r\nThe Acarnanians, finding themselves invaded by a large army by land,\r\nand from the sea threatened by a hostile fleet, made no combined\r\nattempt at resistance, but remained to defend their homes, and sent for\r\nhelp to Phormio, who replied that, when a fleet was on the point of\r\nsailing from Corinth, it was impossible for him to leave Naupactus\r\nunprotected. The Peloponnesians meanwhile and their allies advanced\r\nupon Stratus in three divisions, with the intention of encamping near\r\nit and attempting the wall by force if they failed to succeed by\r\nnegotiation. The order of march was as follows: the centre was occupied\r\nby the Chaonians and the rest of the barbarians, with the Leucadians\r\nand Anactorians and their followers on the right, and Cnemus with the\r\nPeloponnesians and Ambraciots on the left; each division being a long\r\nway off from, and sometimes even out of sight of, the others. The\r\nHellenes advanced in good order, keeping a look-out till they encamped\r\nin a good position; but the Chaonians, filled with self-confidence, and\r\nhaving the highest character for courage among the tribes of that part\r\nof the continent, without waiting to occupy their camp, rushed on with\r\nthe rest of the barbarians, in the idea that they should take the town\r\nby assault and obtain the sole glory of the enterprise. While they were\r\ncoming on, the Stratians, becoming aware how things stood, and thinking\r\nthat the defeat of this division would considerably dishearten the\r\nHellenes behind it, occupied the environs of the town with ambuscades,\r\nand as soon as they approached engaged them at close quarters from the\r\ncity and the ambuscades. A panic seizing the Chaonians, great numbers\r\nof them were slain; and as soon as they were seen to give way the rest\r\nof the barbarians turned and fled. Owing to the distance by which their\r\nallies had preceded them, neither of the Hellenic divisions knew\r\nanything of the battle, but fancied they were hastening on to encamp.\r\nHowever, when the flying barbarians broke in upon them, they opened\r\ntheir ranks to receive them, brought their divisions together, and\r\nstopped quiet where they were for the day; the Stratians not offering\r\nto engage them, as the rest of the Acarnanians had not yet arrived, but\r\ncontenting themselves with slinging at them from a distance, which\r\ndistressed them greatly, as there was no stirring without their armour.\r\nThe Acarnanians would seem to excel in this mode of warfare.\r\n\r\nAs soon as night fell, Cnemus hastily drew off his army to the river\r\nAnapus, about nine miles from Stratus, recovering his dead next day\r\nunder truce, and being there joined by the friendly Oeniadae, fell back\r\nupon their city before the enemy’s reinforcements came up. From hence\r\neach returned home; and the Stratians set up a trophy for the battle\r\nwith the barbarians.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the fleet from Corinth and the rest of the confederates in\r\nthe Crissaean Gulf, which was to have co-operated with Cnemus and\r\nprevented the coast Acarnanians from joining their countrymen in the\r\ninterior, was disabled from doing so by being compelled about the same\r\ntime as the battle at Stratus to fight with Phormio and the twenty\r\nAthenian vessels stationed at Naupactus. For they were watched, as they\r\ncoasted along out of the gulf, by Phormio, who wished to attack in the\r\nopen sea. But the Corinthians and allies had started for Acarnania\r\nwithout any idea of fighting at sea, and with vessels more like\r\ntransports for carrying soldiers; besides which, they never dreamed of\r\nthe twenty Athenian ships venturing to engage their forty-seven.\r\nHowever, while they were coasting along their own shore, there were the\r\nAthenians sailing along in line with them; and when they tried to cross\r\nover from Patrae in Achaea to the mainland on the other side, on their\r\nway to Acarnania, they saw them again coming out from Chalcis and the\r\nriver Evenus to meet them. They slipped from their moorings in the\r\nnight, but were observed, and were at length compelled to fight in mid\r\npassage. Each state that contributed to the armament had its own\r\ngeneral; the Corinthian commanders were Machaon, Isocrates, and\r\nAgatharchidas. The Peloponnesians ranged their vessels in as large a\r\ncircle as possible without leaving an opening, with the prows outside\r\nand the sterns in; and placed within all the small craft in company,\r\nand their five best sailers to issue out at a moment’s notice and\r\nstrengthen any point threatened by the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, formed in line, sailed round and round them, and forced\r\nthem to contract their circle, by continually brushing past and making\r\nas though they would attack at once, having been previously cautioned\r\nby Phormio not to do so till he gave the signal. His hope was that the\r\nPeloponnesians would not retain their order like a force on shore, but\r\nthat the ships would fall foul of one another and the small craft cause\r\nconfusion; and if the wind should blow from the gulf (in expectation of\r\nwhich he kept sailing round them, and which usually rose towards\r\nmorning), they would not, he felt sure, remain steady an instant. He\r\nalso thought that it rested with him to attack when he pleased, as his\r\nships were better sailers, and that an attack timed by the coming of\r\nthe wind would tell best. When the wind came down, the enemy’s ships\r\nwere now in a narrow space, and what with the wind and the small craft\r\ndashing against them, at once fell into confusion: ship fell foul of\r\nship, while the crews were pushing them off with poles, and by their\r\nshouting, swearing, and struggling with one another, made captains’\r\norders and boatswains’ cries alike inaudible, and through being unable\r\nfor want of practice to clear their oars in the rough water, prevented\r\nthe vessels from obeying their helmsmen properly. At this moment\r\nPhormio gave the signal, and the Athenians attacked. Sinking first one\r\nof the admirals, they then disabled all they came across, so that no\r\none thought of resistance for the confusion, but fled for Patrae and\r\nDyme in Achaea. The Athenians gave chase and captured twelve ships, and\r\ntaking most of the men out of them sailed to Molycrium, and after\r\nsetting up a trophy on the promontory of Rhium and dedicating a ship to\r\nPoseidon, returned to Naupactus. As for the Peloponnesians, they at\r\nonce sailed with their remaining ships along the coast from Dyme and\r\nPatrae to Cyllene, the Eleian arsenal; where Cnemus, and the ships from\r\nLeucas that were to have joined them, also arrived after the battle at\r\nStratus.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians now sent to the fleet to Cnemus three\r\ncommissioners—Timocrates, Bradidas, and Lycophron—with orders to\r\nprepare to engage again with better fortune, and not to be driven from\r\nthe sea by a few vessels; for they could not at all account for their\r\ndiscomfiture, the less so as it was their first attempt at sea; and\r\nthey fancied that it was not that their marine was so inferior, but\r\nthat there had been misconduct somewhere, not considering the long\r\nexperience of the Athenians as compared with the little practice which\r\nthey had had themselves. The commissioners were accordingly sent in\r\nanger. As soon as they arrived they set to work with Cnemus to order\r\nships from the different states, and to put those which they already\r\nhad in fighting order. Meanwhile Phormio sent word to Athens of their\r\npreparations and his own victory, and desired as many ships as possible\r\nto be speedily sent to him, as he stood in daily expectation of a\r\nbattle. Twenty were accordingly sent, but instructions were given to\r\ntheir commander to go first to Crete. For Nicias, a Cretan of Gortys,\r\nwho was proxenus of the Athenians, had persuaded them to sail against\r\nCydonia, promising to procure the reduction of that hostile town; his\r\nreal wish being to oblige the Polichnitans, neighbours of the\r\nCydonians. He accordingly went with the ships to Crete, and,\r\naccompanied by the Polichnitans, laid waste the lands of the Cydonians;\r\nand, what with adverse winds and stress of weather wasted no little\r\ntime there.\r\n\r\nWhile the Athenians were thus detained in Crete, the Peloponnesians in\r\nCyllene got ready for battle, and coasted along to Panormus in Achaea,\r\nwhere their land army had come to support them. Phormio also coasted\r\nalong to Molycrian Rhium, and anchored outside it with twenty ships,\r\nthe same as he had fought with before. This Rhium was friendly to the\r\nAthenians. The other, in Peloponnese, lies opposite to it; the sea\r\nbetween them is about three-quarters of a mile broad, and forms the\r\nmouth of the Crissaean gulf. At this, the Achaean Rhium, not far off\r\nPanormus, where their army lay, the Peloponnesians now cast anchor with\r\nseventy-seven ships, when they saw the Athenians do so. For six or\r\nseven days they remained opposite each other, practising and preparing\r\nfor the battle; the one resolved not to sail out of the Rhia into the\r\nopen sea, for fear of the disaster which had already happened to them,\r\nthe other not to sail into the straits, thinking it advantageous to the\r\nenemy, to fight in the narrows. At last Cnemus and Brasidas and the\r\nrest of the Peloponnesian commanders, being desirous of bringing on a\r\nbattle as soon as possible, before reinforcements should arrive from\r\nAthens, and noticing that the men were most of them cowed by the\r\nprevious defeat and out of heart for the business, first called them\r\ntogether and encouraged them as follows:\r\n\r\n“Peloponnesians, the late engagement, which may have made some of you\r\nafraid of the one now in prospect, really gives no just ground for\r\napprehension. Preparation for it, as you know, there was little enough;\r\nand the object of our voyage was not so much to fight at sea as an\r\nexpedition by land. Besides this, the chances of war were largely\r\nagainst us; and perhaps also inexperience had something to do with our\r\nfailure in our first naval action. It was not, therefore, cowardice\r\nthat produced our defeat, nor ought the determination which force has\r\nnot quelled, but which still has a word to say with its adversary, to\r\nlose its edge from the result of an accident; but admitting the\r\npossibility of a chance miscarriage, we should know that brave hearts\r\nmust be always brave, and while they remain so can never put forward\r\ninexperience as an excuse for misconduct. Nor are you so behind the\r\nenemy in experience as you are ahead of him in courage; and although\r\nthe science of your opponents would, if valour accompanied it, have\r\nalso the presence of mind to carry out at in emergency the lesson it\r\nhas learnt, yet a faint heart will make all art powerless in the face\r\nof danger. For fear takes away presence of mind, and without valour art\r\nis useless. Against their superior experience set your superior daring,\r\nand against the fear induced by defeat the fact of your having been\r\nthen unprepared; remember, too, that you have always the advantage of\r\nsuperior numbers, and of engaging off your own coast, supported by your\r\nheavy infantry; and as a rule, numbers and equipment give victory. At\r\nno point, therefore, is defeat likely; and as for our previous\r\nmistakes, the very fact of their occurrence will teach us better for\r\nthe future. Steersmen and sailors may, therefore, confidently attend to\r\ntheir several duties, none quitting the station assigned to them: as\r\nfor ourselves, we promise to prepare for the engagement at least as\r\nwell as your previous commanders, and to give no excuse for any one\r\nmisconducting himself. Should any insist on doing so, he shall meet\r\nwith the punishment he deserves, while the brave shall be honoured with\r\nthe appropriate rewards of valour.”\r\n\r\nThe Peloponnesian commanders encouraged their men after this fashion.\r\nPhormio, meanwhile, being himself not without fears for the courage of\r\nhis men, and noticing that they were forming in groups among themselves\r\nand were alarmed at the odds against them, desired to call them\r\ntogether and give them confidence and counsel in the present emergency.\r\nHe had before continually told them, and had accustomed their minds to\r\nthe idea, that there was no numerical superiority that they could not\r\nface; and the men themselves had long been persuaded that Athenians\r\nneed never retire before any quantity of Peloponnesian vessels. At the\r\nmoment, however, he saw that they were dispirited by the sight before\r\nthem, and wishing to refresh their confidence, called them together and\r\nspoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“I see, my men, that you are frightened by the number of the enemy, and\r\nI have accordingly called you together, not liking you to be afraid of\r\nwhat is not really terrible. In the first place, the Peloponnesians,\r\nalready defeated, and not even themselves thinking that they are a\r\nmatch for us, have not ventured to meet us on equal terms, but have\r\nequipped this multitude of ships against us. Next, as to that upon\r\nwhich they most rely, the courage which they suppose constitutional to\r\nthem, their confidence here only arises from the success which their\r\nexperience in land service usually gives them, and which they fancy\r\nwill do the same for them at sea. But this advantage will in all\r\njustice belong to us on this element, if to them on that; as they are\r\nnot superior to us in courage, but we are each of us more confident,\r\naccording to our experience in our particular department. Besides, as\r\nthe Lacedaemonians use their supremacy over their allies to promote\r\ntheir own glory, they are most of them being brought into danger\r\nagainst their will, or they would never, after such a decided defeat,\r\nhave ventured upon a fresh engagement. You need not, therefore, be\r\nafraid of their dash. You, on the contrary, inspire a much greater and\r\nbetter founded alarm, both because of your late victory and also of\r\ntheir belief that we should not face them unless about to do something\r\nworthy of a success so signal. An adversary numerically superior, like\r\nthe one before us, comes into action trusting more to strength than to\r\nresolution; while he who voluntarily confronts tremendous odds must\r\nhave very great internal resources to draw upon. For these reasons the\r\nPeloponnesians fear our irrational audacity more than they would ever\r\nhave done a more commensurate preparation. Besides, many armaments have\r\nbefore now succumbed to an inferior through want of skill or sometimes\r\nof courage; neither of which defects certainly are ours. As to the\r\nbattle, it shall not be, if I can help it, in the strait, nor will I\r\nsail in there at all; seeing that in a contest between a number of\r\nclumsily managed vessels and a small, fast, well-handled squadron, want\r\nof sea room is an undoubted disadvantage. One cannot run down an enemy\r\nproperly without having a sight of him a good way off, nor can one\r\nretire at need when pressed; one can neither break the line nor return\r\nupon his rear, the proper tactics for a fast sailer; but the naval\r\naction necessarily becomes a land one, in which numbers must decide the\r\nmatter. For all this I will provide as far as can be. Do you stay at\r\nyour posts by your ships, and be sharp at catching the word of command,\r\nthe more so as we are observing one another from so short a distance;\r\nand in action think order and silence all-important—qualities useful in\r\nwar generally, and in naval engagements in particular; and behave\r\nbefore the enemy in a manner worthy of your past exploits. The issues\r\nyou will fight for are great—to destroy the naval hopes of the\r\nPeloponnesians or to bring nearer to the Athenians their fears for the\r\nsea. And I may once more remind you that you have defeated most of them\r\nalready; and beaten men do not face a danger twice with the same\r\ndetermination.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the exhortation of Phormio. The Peloponnesians finding that\r\nthe Athenians did not sail into the gulf and the narrows, in order to\r\nlead them in whether they wished it or not, put out at dawn, and\r\nforming four abreast, sailed inside the gulf in the direction of their\r\nown country, the right wing leading as they had lain at anchor. In this\r\nwing were placed twenty of their best sailers; so that in the event of\r\nPhormio thinking that their object was Naupactus, and coasting along\r\nthither to save the place, the Athenians might not be able to escape\r\ntheir onset by getting outside their wing, but might be cut off by the\r\nvessels in question. As they expected, Phormio, in alarm for the place\r\nat that moment emptied of its garrison, as soon as he saw them put out,\r\nreluctantly and hurriedly embarked and sailed along shore; the\r\nMessenian land forces moving along also to support him. The\r\nPeloponnesians seeing him coasting along with his ships in single file,\r\nand by this inside the gulf and close inshore as they so much wished,\r\nat one signal tacked suddenly and bore down in line at their best speed\r\non the Athenians, hoping to cut off the whole squadron. The eleven\r\nleading vessels, however, escaped the Peloponnesian wing and its sudden\r\nmovement, and reached the more open water; but the rest were overtaken\r\nas they tried to run through, driven ashore and disabled; such of the\r\ncrews being slain as had not swum out of them. Some of the ships the\r\nPeloponnesians lashed to their own, and towed off empty; one they took\r\nwith the men in it; others were just being towed off, when they were\r\nsaved by the Messenians dashing into the sea with their armour and\r\nfighting from the decks that they had boarded.\r\n\r\nThus far victory was with the Peloponnesians, and the Athenian fleet\r\ndestroyed; the twenty ships in the right wing being meanwhile in chase\r\nof the eleven Athenian vessels that had escaped their sudden movement\r\nand reached the more open water. These, with the exception of one ship,\r\nall outsailed them and got safe into Naupactus, and forming close\r\ninshore opposite the temple of Apollo, with their prows facing the\r\nenemy, prepared to defend themselves in case the Peloponnesians should\r\nsail inshore against them. After a while the Peloponnesians came up,\r\nchanting the paean for their victory as they sailed on; the single\r\nAthenian ship remaining being chased by a Leucadian far ahead of the\r\nrest. But there happened to be a merchantman lying at anchor in the\r\nroadstead, which the Athenian ship found time to sail round, and struck\r\nthe Leucadian in chase amidships and sank her. An exploit so sudden and\r\nunexpected produced a panic among the Peloponnesians; and having fallen\r\nout of order in the excitement of victory, some of them dropped their\r\noars and stopped their way in order to let the main body come up—an\r\nunsafe thing to do considering how near they were to the enemy’s prows;\r\nwhile others ran aground in the shallows, in their ignorance of the\r\nlocalities.\r\n\r\nElated at this incident, the Athenians at one word gave a cheer, and\r\ndashed at the enemy, who, embarrassed by his mistakes and the disorder\r\nin which he found himself, only stood for an instant, and then fled for\r\nPanormus, whence he had put out. The Athenians following on his heels\r\ntook the six vessels nearest them, and recovered those of their own\r\nwhich had been disabled close inshore and taken in tow at the beginning\r\nof the action; they killed some of the crews and took some prisoners.\r\nOn board the Leucadian which went down off the merchantman, was the\r\nLacedaemonian Timocrates, who killed himself when the ship was sunk,\r\nand was cast up in the harbour of Naupactus. The Athenians on their\r\nreturn set up a trophy on the spot from which they had put out and\r\nturned the day, and picking up the wrecks and dead that were on their\r\nshore, gave back to the enemy their dead under truce. The\r\nPeloponnesians also set up a trophy as victors for the defeat inflicted\r\nupon the ships they had disabled in shore, and dedicated the vessel\r\nwhich they had taken at Achaean Rhium, side by side with the trophy.\r\nAfter this, apprehensive of the reinforcement expected from Athens, all\r\nexcept the Leucadians sailed into the Crissaean Gulf for Corinth. Not\r\nlong after their retreat, the twenty Athenian ships, which were to have\r\njoined Phormio before the battle, arrived at Naupactus.\r\n\r\nThus the summer ended. Winter was now at hand; but dispersing the\r\nfleet, which had retired to Corinth and the Crissaean Gulf, Cnemus,\r\nBrasidas, and the other Peloponnesian captains allowed themselves to be\r\npersuaded by the Megarians to make an attempt upon Piraeus, the port of\r\nAthens, which from her decided superiority at sea had been naturally\r\nleft unguarded and open. Their plan was as follows: The men were each\r\nto take their oar, cushion, and rowlock thong, and, going overland from\r\nCorinth to the sea on the Athenian side, to get to Megara as quickly as\r\nthey could, and launching forty vessels, which happened to be in the\r\ndocks at Nisaea, to sail at once to Piraeus. There was no fleet on the\r\nlook-out in the harbour, and no one had the least idea of the enemy\r\nattempting a surprise; while an open attack would, it was thought,\r\nnever be deliberately ventured on, or, if in contemplation, would be\r\nspeedily known at Athens. Their plan formed, the next step was to put\r\nit in execution. Arriving by night and launching the vessels from\r\nNisaea, they sailed, not to Piraeus as they had originally intended,\r\nbeing afraid of the risk, besides which there was some talk of a wind\r\nhaving stopped them, but to the point of Salamis that looks towards\r\nMegara; where there was a fort and a squadron of three ships to prevent\r\nanything sailing in or out of Megara. This fort they assaulted, and\r\ntowed off the galleys empty, and surprising the inhabitants began to\r\nlay waste the rest of the island.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile fire signals were raised to alarm Athens, and a panic ensued\r\nthere as serious as any that occurred during the war. The idea in the\r\ncity was that the enemy had already sailed into Piraeus: in Piraeus it\r\nwas thought that they had taken Salamis and might at any moment arrive\r\nin the port; as indeed might easily have been done if their hearts had\r\nbeen a little firmer: certainly no wind would have prevented them. As\r\nsoon as day broke, the Athenians assembled in full force, launched\r\ntheir ships, and embarking in haste and uproar went with the fleet to\r\nSalamis, while their soldiery mounted guard in Piraeus. The\r\nPeloponnesians, on becoming aware of the coming relief, after they had\r\noverrun most of Salamis, hastily sailed off with their plunder and\r\ncaptives and the three ships from Fort Budorum to Nisaea; the state of\r\ntheir ships also causing them some anxiety, as it was a long while\r\nsince they had been launched, and they were not water-tight. Arrived at\r\nMegara, they returned back on foot to Corinth. The Athenians finding\r\nthem no longer at Salamis, sailed back themselves; and after this made\r\narrangements for guarding Piraeus more diligently in future, by closing\r\nthe harbours, and by other suitable precautions.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time, at the beginning of this winter, Sitalces, son of\r\nTeres, the Odrysian king of Thrace, made an expedition against\r\nPerdiccas, son of Alexander, king of Macedonia, and the Chalcidians in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Thrace; his object being to enforce one promise\r\nand fulfil another. On the one hand Perdiccas had made him a promise,\r\nwhen hard pressed at the commencement of the war, upon condition that\r\nSitalces should reconcile the Athenians to him and not attempt to\r\nrestore his brother and enemy, the pretender Philip, but had not\r\noffered to fulfil his engagement; on the other he, Sitalces, on\r\nentering into alliance with the Athenians, had agreed to put an end to\r\nthe Chalcidian war in Thrace. These were the two objects of his\r\ninvasion. With him he brought Amyntas, the son of Philip, whom he\r\ndestined for the throne of Macedonia, and some Athenian envoys then at\r\nhis court on this business, and Hagnon as general; for the Athenians\r\nwere to join him against the Chalcidians with a fleet and as many\r\nsoldiers as they could get together.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the Odrysians, he first called out the Thracian tribes\r\nsubject to him between Mounts Haemus and Rhodope and the Euxine and\r\nHellespont; next the Getae beyond Haemus, and the other hordes settled\r\nsouth of the Danube in the neighbourhood of the Euxine, who, like the\r\nGetae, border on the Scythians and are armed in the same manner, being\r\nall mounted archers. Besides these he summoned many of the hill\r\nThracian independent swordsmen, called Dii and mostly inhabiting Mount\r\nRhodope, some of whom came as mercenaries, others as volunteers; also\r\nthe Agrianes and Laeaeans, and the rest of the Paeonian tribes in his\r\nempire, at the confines of which these lay, extending up to the Laeaean\r\nPaeonians and the river Strymon, which flows from Mount Scombrus\r\nthrough the country of the Agrianes and Laeaeans; there the empire of\r\nSitalces ends and the territory of the independent Paeonians begins.\r\nBordering on the Triballi, also independent, were the Treres and\r\nTilataeans, who dwell to the north of Mount Scombrus and extend towards\r\nthe setting sun as far as the river Oskius. This river rises in the\r\nsame mountains as the Nestus and Hebrus, a wild and extensive range\r\nconnected with Rhodope.\r\n\r\nThe empire of the Odrysians extended along the seaboard from Abdera to\r\nthe mouth of the Danube in the Euxine. The navigation of this coast by\r\nthe shortest route takes a merchantman four days and four nights with a\r\nwind astern the whole way: by land an active man, travelling by the\r\nshortest road, can get from Abdera to the Danube in eleven days. Such\r\nwas the length of its coast line. Inland from Byzantium to the Laeaeans\r\nand the Strymon, the farthest limit of its extension into the interior,\r\nit is a journey of thirteen days for an active man. The tribute from\r\nall the barbarian districts and the Hellenic cities, taking what they\r\nbrought in under Seuthes, the successor of Sitalces, who raised it to\r\nits greatest height, amounted to about four hundred talents in gold and\r\nsilver. There were also presents in gold and silver to a no less\r\namount, besides stuff, plain and embroidered, and other articles, made\r\nnot only for the king, but also for the Odrysian lords and nobles. For\r\nthere was here established a custom opposite to that prevailing in the\r\nPersian kingdom, namely, of taking rather than giving; more disgrace\r\nbeing attached to not giving when asked than to asking and being\r\nrefused; and although this prevailed elsewhere in Thrace, it was\r\npractised most extensively among the powerful Odrysians, it being\r\nimpossible to get anything done without a present. It was thus a very\r\npowerful kingdom; in revenue and general prosperity surpassing all in\r\nEurope between the Ionian Gulf and the Euxine, and in numbers and\r\nmilitary resources coming decidedly next to the Scythians, with whom\r\nindeed no people in Europe can bear comparison, there not being even in\r\nAsia any nation singly a match for them if unanimous, though of course\r\nthey are not on a level with other races in general intelligence and\r\nthe arts of civilized life.\r\n\r\nIt was the master of this empire that now prepared to take the field.\r\nWhen everything was ready, he set out on his march for Macedonia, first\r\nthrough his own dominions, next over the desolate range of Cercine that\r\ndivides the Sintians and Paeonians, crossing by a road which he had\r\nmade by felling the timber on a former campaign against the latter\r\npeople. Passing over these mountains, with the Paeonians on his right\r\nand the Sintians and Maedians on the left, he finally arrived at\r\nDoberus, in Paeonia, losing none of his army on the march, except\r\nperhaps by sickness, but receiving some augmentations, many of the\r\nindependent Thracians volunteering to join him in the hope of plunder;\r\nso that the whole is said to have formed a grand total of a hundred and\r\nfifty thousand. Most of this was infantry, though there was about a\r\nthird cavalry, furnished principally by the Odrysians themselves and\r\nnext to them by the Getae. The most warlike of the infantry were the\r\nindependent swordsmen who came down from Rhodope; the rest of the mixed\r\nmultitude that followed him being chiefly formidable by their numbers.\r\n\r\nAssembling in Doberus, they prepared for descending from the heights\r\nupon Lower Macedonia, where the dominions of Perdiccas lay; for the\r\nLyncestae, Elimiots, and other tribes more inland, though Macedonians\r\nby blood, and allies and dependants of their kindred, still have their\r\nown separate governments. The country on the sea coast, now called\r\nMacedonia, was first acquired by Alexander, the father of Perdiccas,\r\nand his ancestors, originally Temenids from Argos. This was effected by\r\nthe expulsion from Pieria of the Pierians, who afterwards inhabited\r\nPhagres and other places under Mount Pangaeus, beyond the Strymon\r\n(indeed the country between Pangaeus and the sea is still called the\r\nPierian Gulf); of the Bottiaeans, at present neighbours of the\r\nChalcidians, from Bottia, and by the acquisition in Paeonia of a narrow\r\nstrip along the river Axius extending to Pella and the sea; the\r\ndistrict of Mygdonia, between the Axius and the Strymon, being also\r\nadded by the expulsion of the Edonians. From Eordia also were driven\r\nthe Eordians, most of whom perished, though a few of them still live\r\nround Physca, and the Almopians from Almopia. These Macedonians also\r\nconquered places belonging to the other tribes, which are still\r\ntheirs—Anthemus, Crestonia, Bisaltia, and much of Macedonia proper. The\r\nwhole is now called Macedonia, and at the time of the invasion of\r\nSitalces, Perdiccas, Alexander’s son, was the reigning king.\r\n\r\nThese Macedonians, unable to take the field against so numerous an\r\ninvader, shut themselves up in such strong places and fortresses as the\r\ncountry possessed. Of these there was no great number, most of those\r\nnow found in the country having been erected subsequently by Archelaus,\r\nthe son of Perdiccas, on his accession, who also cut straight roads,\r\nand otherwise put the kingdom on a better footing as regards horses,\r\nheavy infantry, and other war material than had been done by all the\r\neight kings that preceded him. Advancing from Doberus, the Thracian\r\nhost first invaded what had been once Philip’s government, and took\r\nIdomene by assault, Gortynia, Atalanta, and some other places by\r\nnegotiation, these last coming over for love of Philip’s son, Amyntas,\r\nthen with Sitalces. Laying siege to Europus, and failing to take it, he\r\nnext advanced into the rest of Macedonia to the left of Pella and\r\nCyrrhus, not proceeding beyond this into Bottiaea and Pieria, but\r\nstaying to lay waste Mygdonia, Crestonia, and Anthemus.\r\n\r\nThe Macedonians never even thought of meeting him with infantry; but\r\nthe Thracian host was, as opportunity offered, attacked by handfuls of\r\ntheir horse, which had been reinforced from their allies in the\r\ninterior. Armed with cuirasses, and excellent horsemen, wherever these\r\ncharged they overthrew all before them, but ran considerable risk in\r\nentangling themselves in the masses of the enemy, and so finally\r\ndesisted from these efforts, deciding that they were not strong enough\r\nto venture against numbers so superior.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Sitalces opened negotiations with Perdiccas on the objects of\r\nhis expedition; and finding that the Athenians, not believing that he\r\nwould come, did not appear with their fleet, though they sent presents\r\nand envoys, dispatched a large part of his army against the Chalcidians\r\nand Bottiaeans, and shutting them up inside their walls laid waste\r\ntheir country. While he remained in these parts, the people farther\r\nsouth, such as the Thessalians, Magnetes, and the other tribes subject\r\nto the Thessalians, and the Hellenes as far as Thermopylae, all feared\r\nthat the army might advance against them, and prepared accordingly.\r\nThese fears were shared by the Thracians beyond the Strymon to the\r\nnorth, who inhabited the plains, such as the Panaeans, the Odomanti,\r\nthe Droi, and the Dersaeans, all of whom are independent. It was even\r\nmatter of conversation among the Hellenes who were enemies of Athens\r\nwhether he might not be invited by his ally to advance also against\r\nthem. Meanwhile he held Chalcidice and Bottice and Macedonia, and was\r\nravaging them all; but finding that he was not succeeding in any of the\r\nobjects of his invasion, and that his army was without provisions and\r\nwas suffering from the severity of the season, he listened to the\r\nadvice of Seuthes, son of Spardacus, his nephew and highest officer,\r\nand decided to retreat without delay. This Seuthes had been secretly\r\ngained by Perdiccas by the promise of his sister in marriage with a\r\nrich dowry. In accordance with this advice, and after a stay of thirty\r\ndays in all, eight of which were spent in Chalcidice, he retired home\r\nas quickly as he could; and Perdiccas afterwards gave his sister\r\nStratonice to Seuthes as he had promised. Such was the history of the\r\nexpedition of Sitalces.\r\n\r\nIn the course of this winter, after the dispersion of the Peloponnesian\r\nfleet, the Athenians in Naupactus, under Phormio, coasted along to\r\nAstacus and disembarked, and marched into the interior of Acarnania\r\nwith four hundred Athenian heavy infantry and four hundred Messenians.\r\nAfter expelling some suspected persons from Stratus, Coronta, and other\r\nplaces, and restoring Cynes, son of Theolytus, to Coronta, they\r\nreturned to their ships, deciding that it was impossible in the winter\r\nseason to march against Oeniadae, a place which, unlike the rest of\r\nAcarnania, had been always hostile to them; for the river Achelous\r\nflowing from Mount Pindus through Dolopia and the country of the\r\nAgraeans and Amphilochians and the plain of Acarnania, past the town of\r\nStratus in the upper part of its course, forms lakes where it falls\r\ninto the sea round Oeniadae, and thus makes it impracticable for an\r\narmy in winter by reason of the water. Opposite to Oeniadae lie most of\r\nthe islands called Echinades, so close to the mouths of the Achelous\r\nthat that powerful stream is constantly forming deposits against them,\r\nand has already joined some of the islands to the continent, and seems\r\nlikely in no long while to do the same with the rest. For the current\r\nis strong, deep, and turbid, and the islands are so thick together that\r\nthey serve to imprison the alluvial deposit and prevent its dispersing,\r\nlying, as they do, not in one line, but irregularly, so as to leave no\r\ndirect passage for the water into the open sea. The islands in question\r\nare uninhabited and of no great size. There is also a story that\r\nAlcmaeon, son of Amphiraus, during his wanderings after the murder of\r\nhis mother was bidden by Apollo to inhabit this spot, through an oracle\r\nwhich intimated that he would have no release from his terrors until he\r\nshould find a country to dwell in which had not been seen by the sun,\r\nor existed as land at the time he slew his mother; all else being to\r\nhim polluted ground. Perplexed at this, the story goes on to say, he at\r\nlast observed this deposit of the Achelous, and considered that a place\r\nsufficient to support life upon, might have been thrown up during the\r\nlong interval that had elapsed since the death of his mother and the\r\nbeginning of his wanderings. Settling, therefore, in the district round\r\nOeniadae, he founded a dominion, and left the country its name from his\r\nson Acarnan. Such is the story we have received concerning Alcmaeon.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians and Phormio putting back from Acarnania and arriving at\r\nNaupactus, sailed home to Athens in the spring, taking with them the\r\nships that they had captured, and such of the prisoners made in the\r\nlate actions as were freemen; who were exchanged, man for man. And so\r\nended this winter, and the third year of this war, of which Thucydides\r\nwas the historian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK III\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\n\r\nFourth and Fifth Years of the War—Revolt of Mitylene\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next summer, just as the corn was getting ripe, the Peloponnesians\r\nand their allies invaded Attica under the command of Archidamus, son of\r\nZeuxidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians, and sat down and ravaged the\r\nland; the Athenian horse as usual attacking them, wherever it was\r\npracticable, and preventing the mass of the light troops from advancing\r\nfrom their camp and wasting the parts near the city. After staying the\r\ntime for which they had taken provisions, the invaders retired and\r\ndispersed to their several cities.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the invasion of the Peloponnesians all Lesbos, except\r\nMethymna, revolted from the Athenians. The Lesbians had wished to\r\nrevolt even before the war, but the Lacedaemonians would not receive\r\nthem; and yet now when they did revolt, they were compelled to do so\r\nsooner than they had intended. While they were waiting until the moles\r\nfor their harbours and the ships and walls that they had in building\r\nshould be finished, and for the arrival of archers and corn and other\r\nthings that they were engaged in fetching from the Pontus, the\r\nTenedians, with whom they were at enmity, and the Methymnians, and some\r\nfactious persons in Mitylene itself, who were proxeni of Athens,\r\ninformed the Athenians that the Mitylenians were forcibly uniting the\r\nisland under their sovereignty, and that the preparations about which\r\nthey were so active, were all concerted with the Boeotians their\r\nkindred and the Lacedaemonians with a view to a revolt, and that,\r\nunless they were immediately prevented, Athens would lose Lesbos.\r\n\r\nHowever, the Athenians, distressed by the plague, and by the war that\r\nhad recently broken out and was now raging, thought it a serious matter\r\nto add Lesbos with its fleet and untouched resources to the list of\r\ntheir enemies; and at first would not believe the charge, giving too\r\nmuch weight to their wish that it might not be true. But when an\r\nembassy which they sent had failed to persuade the Mitylenians to give\r\nup the union and preparations complained of, they became alarmed, and\r\nresolved to strike the first blow. They accordingly suddenly sent off\r\nforty ships that had been got ready to sail round Peloponnese, under\r\nthe command of Cleippides, son of Deinias, and two others; word having\r\nbeen brought them of a festival in honour of the Malean Apollo outside\r\nthe town, which is kept by the whole people of Mitylene, and at which,\r\nif haste were made, they might hope to take them by surprise. If this\r\nplan succeeded, well and good; if not, they were to order the\r\nMitylenians to deliver up their ships and to pull down their walls, and\r\nif they did not obey, to declare war. The ships accordingly set out;\r\nthe ten galleys, forming the contingent of the Mitylenians present with\r\nthe fleet according to the terms of the alliance, being detained by the\r\nAthenians, and their crews placed in custody. However, the Mitylenians\r\nwere informed of the expedition by a man who crossed from Athens to\r\nEuboea, and going overland to Geraestus, sailed from thence by a\r\nmerchantman which he found on the point of putting to sea, and so\r\narrived at Mitylene the third day after leaving Athens. The Mitylenians\r\naccordingly refrained from going out to the temple at Malea, and\r\nmoreover barricaded and kept guard round the half-finished parts of\r\ntheir walls and harbours.\r\n\r\nWhen the Athenians sailed in not long after and saw how things stood,\r\nthe generals delivered their orders, and upon the Mitylenians refusing\r\nto obey, commenced hostilities. The Mitylenians, thus compelled to go\r\nto war without notice and unprepared, at first sailed out with their\r\nfleet and made some show of fighting, a little in front of the harbour;\r\nbut being driven back by the Athenian ships, immediately offered to\r\ntreat with the commanders, wishing, if possible, to get the ships away\r\nfor the present upon any tolerable terms. The Athenian commanders\r\naccepted their offers, being themselves fearful that they might not be\r\nable to cope with the whole of Lesbos; and an armistice having been\r\nconcluded, the Mitylenians sent to Athens one of the informers, already\r\nrepentant of his conduct, and others with him, to try to persuade the\r\nAthenians of the innocence of their intentions and to get the fleet\r\nrecalled. In the meantime, having no great hope of a favourable answer\r\nfrom Athens, they also sent off a galley with envoys to Lacedaemon,\r\nunobserved by the Athenian fleet which was anchored at Malea to the\r\nnorth of the town.\r\n\r\nWhile these envoys, reaching Lacedaemon after a difficult journey\r\nacross the open sea, were negotiating for succours being sent them, the\r\nambassadors from Athens returned without having effected anything; and\r\nhostilities were at once begun by the Mitylenians and the rest of\r\nLesbos, with the exception of the Methymnians, who came to the aid of\r\nthe Athenians with the Imbrians and Lemnians and some few of the other\r\nallies. The Mitylenians made a sortie with all their forces against the\r\nAthenian camp; and a battle ensued, in which they gained some slight\r\nadvantage, but retired notwithstanding, not feeling sufficient\r\nconfidence in themselves to spend the night upon the field. After this\r\nthey kept quiet, wishing to wait for the chance of reinforcements\r\narriving from Peloponnese before making a second venture, being\r\nencouraged by the arrival of Meleas, a Laconian, and Hermaeondas, a\r\nTheban, who had been sent off before the insurrection but had been\r\nunable to reach Lesbos before the Athenian expedition, and who now\r\nstole in in a galley after the battle, and advised them to send another\r\ngalley and envoys back with them, which the Mitylenians accordingly\r\ndid.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians, greatly encouraged by the inaction of the\r\nMitylenians, summoned allies to their aid, who came in all the quicker\r\nfrom seeing so little vigour displayed by the Lesbians, and bringing\r\nround their ships to a new station to the south of the town, fortified\r\ntwo camps, one on each side of the city, and instituted a blockade of\r\nboth the harbours. The sea was thus closed against the Mitylenians,\r\nwho, however, commanded the whole country, with the rest of the\r\nLesbians who had now joined them; the Athenians only holding a limited\r\narea round their camps, and using Malea more as the station for their\r\nships and their market.\r\n\r\nWhile the war went on in this way at Mitylene, the Athenians, about the\r\nsame time in this summer, also sent thirty ships to Peloponnese under\r\nAsopius, son of Phormio; the Acarnanians insisting that the commander\r\nsent should be some son or relative of Phormio. As the ships coasted\r\nalong shore they ravaged the seaboard of Laconia; after which Asopius\r\nsent most of the fleet home, and himself went on with twelve vessels to\r\nNaupactus, and afterwards raising the whole Acarnanian population made\r\nan expedition against Oeniadae, the fleet sailing along the Achelous,\r\nwhile the army laid waste the country. The inhabitants, however,\r\nshowing no signs of submitting, he dismissed the land forces and\r\nhimself sailed to Leucas, and making a descent upon Nericus was cut off\r\nduring his retreat, and most of his troops with him, by the people in\r\nthose parts aided by some coastguards; after which the Athenians sailed\r\naway, recovering their dead from the Leucadians under truce.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the envoys of the Mitylenians sent out in the first ship were\r\ntold by the Lacedaemonians to come to Olympia, in order that the rest\r\nof the allies might hear them and decide upon their matter, and so they\r\njourneyed thither. It was the Olympiad in which the Rhodian Dorieus\r\ngained his second victory, and the envoys having been introduced to\r\nmake their speech after the festival, spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“Lacedaemonians and allies, the rule established among the Hellenes is\r\nnot unknown to us. Those who revolt in war and forsake their former\r\nconfederacy are favourably regarded by those who receive them, in so\r\nfar as they are of use to them, but otherwise are thought less well of,\r\nthrough being considered traitors to their former friends. Nor is this\r\nan unfair way of judging, where the rebels and the power from whom they\r\nsecede are at one in policy and sympathy, and a match for each other in\r\nresources and power, and where no reasonable ground exists for the\r\nrebellion. But with us and the Athenians this was not the case; and no\r\none need think the worse of us for revolting from them in danger, after\r\nhaving been honoured by them in time of peace.\r\n\r\n“Justice and honesty will be the first topics of our speech, especially\r\nas we are asking for alliance; because we know that there can never be\r\nany solid friendship between individuals, or union between communities\r\nthat is worth the name, unless the parties be persuaded of each other’s\r\nhonesty, and be generally congenial the one to the other; since from\r\ndifference in feeling springs also difference in conduct. Between\r\nourselves and the Athenians alliance began, when you withdrew from the\r\nMedian War and they remained to finish the business. But we did not\r\nbecome allies of the Athenians for the subjugation of the Hellenes, but\r\nallies of the Hellenes for their liberation from the Mede; and as long\r\nas the Athenians led us fairly we followed them loyally; but when we\r\nsaw them relax their hostility to the Mede, to try to compass the\r\nsubjection of the allies, then our apprehensions began. Unable,\r\nhowever, to unite and defend themselves, on account of the number of\r\nconfederates that had votes, all the allies were enslaved, except\r\nourselves and the Chians, who continued to send our contingents as\r\nindependent and nominally free. Trust in Athens as a leader, however,\r\nwe could no longer feel, judging by the examples already given; it\r\nbeing unlikely that she would reduce our fellow confederates, and not\r\ndo the same by us who were left, if ever she had the power.\r\n\r\n“Had we all been still independent, we could have had more faith in\r\ntheir not attempting any change; but the greater number being their\r\nsubjects, while they were treating us as equals, they would naturally\r\nchafe under this solitary instance of independence as contrasted with\r\nthe submission of the majority; particularly as they daily grew more\r\npowerful, and we more destitute. Now the only sure basis of an alliance\r\nis for each party to be equally afraid of the other; he who would like\r\nto encroach is then deterred by the reflection that he will not have\r\nodds in his favour. Again, if we were left independent, it was only\r\nbecause they thought they saw their way to empire more clearly by\r\nspecious language and by the paths of policy than by those of force.\r\nNot only were we useful as evidence that powers who had votes, like\r\nthemselves, would not, surely, join them in their expeditions, against\r\ntheir will, without the party attacked being in the wrong; but the same\r\nsystem also enabled them to lead the stronger states against the weaker\r\nfirst, and so to leave the former to the last, stripped of their\r\nnatural allies, and less capable of resistance. But if they had begun\r\nwith us, while all the states still had their resources under their own\r\ncontrol, and there was a centre to rally round, the work of subjugation\r\nwould have been found less easy. Besides this, our navy gave them some\r\napprehension: it was always possible that it might unite with you or\r\nwith some other power, and become dangerous to Athens. The court which\r\nwe paid to their commons and its leaders for the time being also helped\r\nus to maintain our independence. However, we did not expect to be able\r\nto do so much longer, if this war had not broken out, from the examples\r\nthat we had had of their conduct to the rest.\r\n\r\n“How then could we put our trust in such friendship or freedom as we\r\nhad here? We accepted each other against our inclination; fear made\r\nthem court us in war, and us them in peace; sympathy, the ordinary\r\nbasis of confidence, had its place supplied by terror, fear having more\r\nshare than friendship in detaining us in the alliance; and the first\r\nparty that should be encouraged by the hope of impunity was certain to\r\nbreak faith with the other. So that to condemn us for being the first\r\nto break off, because they delay the blow that we dread, instead of\r\nourselves delaying to know for certain whether it will be dealt or not,\r\nis to take a false view of the case. For if we were equally able with\r\nthem to meet their plots and imitate their delay, we should be their\r\nequals and should be under no necessity of being their subjects; but\r\nthe liberty of offence being always theirs, that of defence ought\r\nclearly to be ours.\r\n\r\n“Such, Lacedaemonians and allies, are the grounds and the reasons of\r\nour revolt; clear enough to convince our hearers of the fairness of our\r\nconduct, and sufficient to alarm ourselves, and to make us turn to some\r\nmeans of safety. This we wished to do long ago, when we sent to you on\r\nthe subject while the peace yet lasted, but were balked by your\r\nrefusing to receive us; and now, upon the Boeotians inviting us, we at\r\nonce responded to the call, and decided upon a twofold revolt, from the\r\nHellenes and from the Athenians, not to aid the latter in harming the\r\nformer, but to join in their liberation, and not to allow the Athenians\r\nin the end to destroy us, but to act in time against them. Our revolt,\r\nhowever, has taken place prematurely and without preparation—a fact\r\nwhich makes it all the more incumbent on you to receive us into\r\nalliance and to send us speedy relief, in order to show that you\r\nsupport your friends, and at the same time do harm to your enemies. You\r\nhave an opportunity such as you never had before. Disease and\r\nexpenditure have wasted the Athenians: their ships are either cruising\r\nround your coasts, or engaged in blockading us; and it is not probable\r\nthat they will have any to spare, if you invade them a second time this\r\nsummer by sea and land; but they will either offer no resistance to\r\nyour vessels, or withdraw from both our shores. Nor must it be thought\r\nthat this is a case of putting yourselves into danger for a country\r\nwhich is not yours. Lesbos may appear far off, but when help is wanted\r\nshe will be found near enough. It is not in Attica that the war will be\r\ndecided, as some imagine, but in the countries by which Attica is\r\nsupported; and the Athenian revenue is drawn from the allies, and will\r\nbecome still larger if they reduce us; as not only will no other state\r\nrevolt, but our resources will be added to theirs, and we shall be\r\ntreated worse than those that were enslaved before. But if you will\r\nfrankly support us, you will add to your side a state that has a large\r\nnavy, which is your great want; you will smooth the way to the\r\noverthrow of the Athenians by depriving them of their allies, who will\r\nbe greatly encouraged to come over; and you will free yourselves from\r\nthe imputation made against you, of not supporting insurrection. In\r\nshort, only show yourselves as liberators, and you may count upon\r\nhaving the advantage in the war.\r\n\r\n“Respect, therefore, the hopes placed in you by the Hellenes, and that\r\nOlympian Zeus, in whose temple we stand as very suppliants; become the\r\nallies and defenders of the Mitylenians, and do not sacrifice us, who\r\nput our lives upon the hazard, in a cause in which general good will\r\nresult to all from our success, and still more general harm if we fail\r\nthrough your refusing to help us; but be the men that the Hellenes\r\nthink you, and our fears desire.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of the Mitylenians. After hearing them out, the\r\nLacedaemonians and confederates granted what they urged, and took the\r\nLesbians into alliance, and deciding in favour of the invasion of\r\nAttica, told the allies present to march as quickly as possible to the\r\nIsthmus with two-thirds of their forces; and arriving there first\r\nthemselves, got ready hauling machines to carry their ships across from\r\nCorinth to the sea on the side of Athens, in order to make their attack\r\nby sea and land at once. However, the zeal which they displayed was not\r\nimitated by the rest of the confederates, who came in but slowly, being\r\nengaged in harvesting their corn and sick of making expeditions.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians, aware that the preparations of the enemy were\r\ndue to his conviction of their weakness, and wishing to show him that\r\nhe was mistaken, and that they were able, without moving the Lesbian\r\nfleet, to repel with ease that with which they were menaced from\r\nPeloponnese, manned a hundred ships by embarking the citizens of\r\nAthens, except the knights and Pentacosiomedimni, and the resident\r\naliens; and putting out to the Isthmus, displayed their power, and made\r\ndescents upon Peloponnese wherever they pleased. A disappointment so\r\nsignal made the Lacedaemonians think that the Lesbians had not spoken\r\nthe truth; and embarrassed by the non-appearance of the confederates,\r\ncoupled with the news that the thirty ships round Peloponnese were\r\nravaging the lands near Sparta, they went back home. Afterwards,\r\nhowever, they got ready a fleet to send to Lesbos, and ordering a total\r\nof forty ships from the different cities in the league, appointed\r\nAlcidas to command the expedition in his capacity of high admiral.\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians in the hundred ships, upon seeing the\r\nLacedaemonians go home, went home likewise.\r\n\r\nIf, at the time that this fleet was at sea, Athens had almost the\r\nlargest number of first-rate ships in commission that she ever\r\npossessed at any one moment, she had as many or even more when the war\r\nbegan. At that time one hundred guarded Attica, Euboea, and Salamis; a\r\nhundred more were cruising round Peloponnese, besides those employed at\r\nPotidæa and in other places; making a grand total of two hundred and\r\nfifty vessels employed on active service in a single summer. It was\r\nthis, with Potidæa, that most exhausted her revenues—Potidæa being\r\nblockaded by a force of heavy infantry (each drawing two drachmae a\r\nday, one for himself and another for his servant), which amounted to\r\nthree thousand at first, and was kept at this number down to the end of\r\nthe siege; besides sixteen hundred with Phormio who went away before it\r\nwas over; and the ships being all paid at the same rate. In this way\r\nher money was wasted at first; and this was the largest number of ships\r\never manned by her.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time that the Lacedaemonians were at the Isthmus, the\r\nMitylenians marched by land with their mercenaries against Methymna,\r\nwhich they thought to gain by treachery. After assaulting the town, and\r\nnot meeting with the success that they anticipated, they withdrew to\r\nAntissa, Pyrrha, and Eresus; and taking measures for the better\r\nsecurity of these towns and strengthening their walls, hastily returned\r\nhome. After their departure the Methymnians marched against Antissa,\r\nbut were defeated in a sortie by the Antissians and their mercenaries,\r\nand retreated in haste after losing many of their number. Word of this\r\nreaching Athens, and the Athenians learning that the Mitylenians were\r\nmasters of the country and their own soldiers unable to hold them in\r\ncheck, they sent out about the beginning of autumn Paches, son of\r\nEpicurus, to take the command, and a thousand Athenian heavy infantry;\r\nwho worked their own passage and, arriving at Mitylene, built a single\r\nwall all round it, forts being erected at some of the strongest points.\r\nMitylene was thus blockaded strictly on both sides, by land and by sea;\r\nand winter now drew near.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians needing money for the siege, although they had for the\r\nfirst time raised a contribution of two hundred talents from their own\r\ncitizens, now sent out twelve ships to levy subsidies from their\r\nallies, with Lysicles and four others in command. After cruising to\r\ndifferent places and laying them under contribution, Lysicles went up\r\nthe country from Myus, in Caria, across the plain of the Meander, as\r\nfar as the hill of Sandius; and being attacked by the Carians and the\r\npeople of Anaia, was slain with many of his soldiers.\r\n\r\nThe same winter the Plataeans, who were still being besieged by the\r\nPeloponnesians and Boeotians, distressed by the failure of their\r\nprovisions, and seeing no hope of relief from Athens, nor any other\r\nmeans of safety, formed a scheme with the Athenians besieged with them\r\nfor escaping, if possible, by forcing their way over the enemy’s walls;\r\nthe attempt having been suggested by Theaenetus, son of Tolmides, a\r\nsoothsayer, and Eupompides, son of Daimachus, one of their generals. At\r\nfirst all were to join: afterwards, half hung back, thinking the risk\r\ngreat; about two hundred and twenty, however, voluntarily persevered in\r\nthe attempt, which was carried out in the following way. Ladders were\r\nmade to match the height of the enemy’s wall, which they measured by\r\nthe layers of bricks, the side turned towards them not being thoroughly\r\nwhitewashed. These were counted by many persons at once; and though\r\nsome might miss the right calculation, most would hit upon it,\r\nparticularly as they counted over and over again, and were no great way\r\nfrom the wall, but could see it easily enough for their purpose. The\r\nlength required for the ladders was thus obtained, being calculated\r\nfrom the breadth of the brick.\r\n\r\nNow the wall of the Peloponnesians was constructed as follows. It\r\nconsisted of two lines drawn round the place, one against the\r\nPlataeans, the other against any attack on the outside from Athens,\r\nabout sixteen feet apart. The intermediate space of sixteen feet was\r\noccupied by huts portioned out among the soldiers on guard, and built\r\nin one block, so as to give the appearance of a single thick wall with\r\nbattlements on either side. At intervals of every ten battlements were\r\ntowers of considerable size, and the same breadth as the wall, reaching\r\nright across from its inner to its outer face, with no means of passing\r\nexcept through the middle. Accordingly on stormy and wet nights the\r\nbattlements were deserted, and guard kept from the towers, which were\r\nnot far apart and roofed in above.\r\n\r\nSuch being the structure of the wall by which the Plataeans were\r\nblockaded, when their preparations were completed, they waited for a\r\nstormy night of wind and rain and without any moon, and then set out,\r\nguided by the authors of the enterprise. Crossing first the ditch that\r\nran round the town, they next gained the wall of the enemy unperceived\r\nby the sentinels, who did not see them in the darkness, or hear them,\r\nas the wind drowned with its roar the noise of their approach; besides\r\nwhich they kept a good way off from each other, that they might not be\r\nbetrayed by the clash of their weapons. They were also lightly\r\nequipped, and had only the left foot shod to preserve them from\r\nslipping in the mire. They came up to the battlements at one of the\r\nintermediate spaces where they knew them to be unguarded: those who\r\ncarried the ladders went first and planted them; next twelve\r\nlight-armed soldiers with only a dagger and a breastplate mounted, led\r\nby Ammias, son of Coroebus, who was the first on the wall; his\r\nfollowers getting up after him and going six to each of the towers.\r\nAfter these came another party of light troops armed with spears, whose\r\nshields, that they might advance the easier, were carried by men\r\nbehind, who were to hand them to them when they found themselves in\r\npresence of the enemy. After a good many had mounted they were\r\ndiscovered by the sentinels in the towers, by the noise made by a tile\r\nwhich was knocked down by one of the Plataeans as he was laying hold of\r\nthe battlements. The alarm was instantly given, and the troops rushed\r\nto the wall, not knowing the nature of the danger, owing to the dark\r\nnight and stormy weather; the Plataeans in the town having also chosen\r\nthat moment to make a sortie against the wall of the Peloponnesians\r\nupon the side opposite to that on which their men were getting over, in\r\norder to divert the attention of the besiegers. Accordingly they\r\nremained distracted at their several posts, without any venturing to\r\nstir to give help from his own station, and at a loss to guess what was\r\ngoing on. Meanwhile the three hundred set aside for service on\r\nemergencies went outside the wall in the direction of the alarm.\r\nFire-signals of an attack were also raised towards Thebes; but the\r\nPlataeans in the town at once displayed a number of others, prepared\r\nbeforehand for this very purpose, in order to render the enemy’s\r\nsignals unintelligible, and to prevent his friends getting a true idea\r\nof what was passing and coming to his aid before their comrades who had\r\ngone out should have made good their escape and be in safety.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the first of the scaling party that had got up, after\r\ncarrying both the towers and putting the sentinels to the sword, posted\r\nthemselves inside to prevent any one coming through against them; and\r\nrearing ladders from the wall, sent several men up on the towers, and\r\nfrom their summit and base kept in check all of the enemy that came up,\r\nwith their missiles, while their main body planted a number of ladders\r\nagainst the wall, and knocking down the battlements, passed over\r\nbetween the towers; each as soon as he had got over taking up his\r\nstation at the edge of the ditch, and plying from thence with arrows\r\nand darts any who came along the wall to stop the passage of his\r\ncomrades. When all were over, the party on the towers came down, the\r\nlast of them not without difficulty, and proceeded to the ditch, just\r\nas the three hundred came up carrying torches. The Plataeans, standing\r\non the edge of the ditch in the dark, had a good view of their\r\nopponents, and discharged their arrows and darts upon the unarmed parts\r\nof their bodies, while they themselves could not be so well seen in the\r\nobscurity for the torches; and thus even the last of them got over the\r\nditch, though not without effort and difficulty; as ice had formed in\r\nit, not strong enough to walk upon, but of that watery kind which\r\ngenerally comes with a wind more east than north, and the snow which\r\nthis wind had caused to fall during the night had made the water in the\r\nditch rise, so that they could scarcely breast it as they crossed.\r\nHowever, it was mainly the violence of the storm that enabled them to\r\neffect their escape at all.\r\n\r\nStarting from the ditch, the Plataeans went all together along the road\r\nleading to Thebes, keeping the chapel of the hero Androcrates upon\r\ntheir right; considering that the last road which the Peloponnesians\r\nwould suspect them of having taken would be that towards their enemies’\r\ncountry. Indeed they could see them pursuing with torches upon the\r\nAthens road towards Cithaeron and Druoskephalai or Oakheads. After\r\ngoing for rather more than half a mile upon the road to Thebes, the\r\nPlataeans turned off and took that leading to the mountain, to Erythrae\r\nand Hysiae, and reaching the hills, made good their escape to Athens,\r\ntwo hundred and twelve men in all; some of their number having turned\r\nback into the town before getting over the wall, and one archer having\r\nbeen taken prisoner at the outer ditch. Meanwhile the Peloponnesians\r\ngave up the pursuit and returned to their posts; and the Plataeans in\r\nthe town, knowing nothing of what had passed, and informed by those who\r\nhad turned back that not a man had escaped, sent out a herald as soon\r\nas it was day to make a truce for the recovery of the dead bodies, and\r\nthen, learning the truth, desisted. In this way the Plataean party got\r\nover and were saved.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of the same winter, Salaethus, a Lacedaemonian, was\r\nsent out in a galley from Lacedaemon to Mitylene. Going by sea to\r\nPyrrha, and from thence overland, he passed along the bed of a torrent,\r\nwhere the line of circumvallation was passable, and thus entering\r\nunperceived into Mitylene told the magistrates that Attica would\r\ncertainly be invaded, and the forty ships destined to relieve them\r\narrive, and that he had been sent on to announce this and to\r\nsuperintend matters generally. The Mitylenians upon this took courage,\r\nand laid aside the idea of treating with the Athenians; and now this\r\nwinter ended, and with it ended the fourth year of the war of which\r\nThucydides was the historian.\r\n\r\nThe next summer the Peloponnesians sent off the forty-two ships for\r\nMitylene, under Alcidas, their high admiral, and themselves and their\r\nallies invaded Attica, their object being to distract the Athenians by\r\na double movement, and thus to make it less easy for them to act\r\nagainst the fleet sailing to Mitylene. The commander in this invasion\r\nwas Cleomenes, in the place of King Pausanias, son of Pleistoanax, his\r\nnephew, who was still a minor. Not content with laying waste whatever\r\nhad shot up in the parts which they had before devastated, the invaders\r\nnow extended their ravages to lands passed over in their previous\r\nincursions; so that this invasion was more severely felt by the\r\nAthenians than any except the second; the enemy staying on and on until\r\nthey had overrun most of the country, in the expectation of hearing\r\nfrom Lesbos of something having been achieved by their fleet, which\r\nthey thought must now have got over. However, as they did not obtain\r\nany of the results expected, and their provisions began to run short,\r\nthey retreated and dispersed to their different cities.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Mitylenians, finding their provisions failing,\r\nwhile the fleet from Peloponnese was loitering on the way instead of\r\nappearing at Mitylene, were compelled to come to terms with the\r\nAthenians in the following manner. Salaethus having himself ceased to\r\nexpect the fleet to arrive, now armed the commons with heavy armour,\r\nwhich they had not before possessed, with the intention of making a\r\nsortie against the Athenians. The commons, however, no sooner found\r\nthemselves possessed of arms than they refused any longer to obey their\r\nofficers; and forming in knots together, told the authorities to bring\r\nout in public the provisions and divide them amongst them all, or they\r\nwould themselves come to terms with the Athenians and deliver up the\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nThe government, aware of their inability to prevent this, and of the\r\ndanger they would be in, if left out of the capitulation, publicly\r\nagreed with Paches and the army to surrender Mitylene at discretion and\r\nto admit the troops into the town; upon the understanding that the\r\nMitylenians should be allowed to send an embassy to Athens to plead\r\ntheir cause, and that Paches should not imprison, make slaves of, or\r\nput to death any of the citizens until its return. Such were the terms\r\nof the capitulation; in spite of which the chief authors of the\r\nnegotiation with Lacedaemon were so completely overcome by terror when\r\nthe army entered that they went and seated themselves by the altars,\r\nfrom which they were raised up by Paches under promise that he would do\r\nthem no wrong, and lodged by him in Tenedos, until he should learn the\r\npleasure of the Athenians concerning them. Paches also sent some\r\ngalleys and seized Antissa, and took such other military measures as he\r\nthought advisable.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Peloponnesians in the forty ships, who ought to have made\r\nall haste to relieve Mitylene, lost time in coming round Peloponnese\r\nitself, and proceeding leisurely on the remainder of the voyage, made\r\nDelos without having been seen by the Athenians at Athens, and from\r\nthence arriving at Icarus and Myconus, there first heard of the fall of\r\nMitylene. Wishing to know the truth, they put into Embatum, in the\r\nErythraeid, about seven days after the capture of the town. Here they\r\nlearned the truth, and began to consider what they were to do; and\r\nTeutiaplus, an Elean, addressed them as follows:\r\n\r\n“Alcidas and Peloponnesians who share with me the command of this\r\narmament, my advice is to sail just as we are to Mitylene, before we\r\nhave been heard of. We may expect to find the Athenians as much off\r\ntheir guard as men generally are who have just taken a city: this will\r\ncertainly be so by sea, where they have no idea of any enemy attacking\r\nthem, and where our strength, as it happens, mainly lies; while even\r\ntheir land forces are probably scattered about the houses in the\r\ncarelessness of victory. If therefore we were to fall upon them\r\nsuddenly and in the night, I have hopes, with the help of the\r\nwell-wishers that we may have left inside the town, that we shall\r\nbecome masters of the place. Let us not shrink from the risk, but let\r\nus remember that this is just the occasion for one of the baseless\r\npanics common in war: and that to be able to guard against these in\r\none’s own case, and to detect the moment when an attack will find an\r\nenemy at this disadvantage, is what makes a successful general.”\r\n\r\nThese words of Teutiaplus failing to move Alcidas, some of the Ionian\r\nexiles and the Lesbians with the expedition began to urge him, since\r\nthis seemed too dangerous, to seize one of the Ionian cities or the\r\nAeolic town of Cyme, to use as a base for effecting the revolt of\r\nIonia. This was by no means a hopeless enterprise, as their coming was\r\nwelcome everywhere; their object would be by this move to deprive\r\nAthens of her chief source of revenue, and at the same time to saddle\r\nher with expense, if she chose to blockade them; and they would\r\nprobably induce Pissuthnes to join them in the war. However, Alcidas\r\ngave this proposal as bad a reception as the other, being eager, since\r\nhe had come too late for Mitylene, to find himself back in Peloponnese\r\nas soon as possible.\r\n\r\nAccordingly he put out from Embatum and proceeded along shore; and\r\ntouching at the Teian town, Myonnesus, there butchered most of the\r\nprisoners that he had taken on his passage. Upon his coming to anchor\r\nat Ephesus, envoys came to him from the Samians at Anaia, and told him\r\nthat he was not going the right way to free Hellas in massacring men\r\nwho had never raised a hand against him, and who were not enemies of\r\nhis, but allies of Athens against their will, and that if he did not\r\nstop he would turn many more friends into enemies than enemies into\r\nfriends. Alcidas agreed to this, and let go all the Chians still in his\r\nhands and some of the others that he had taken; the inhabitants,\r\ninstead of flying at the sight of his vessels, rather coming up to\r\nthem, taking them for Athenian, having no sort of expectation that\r\nwhile the Athenians commanded the sea Peloponnesian ships would venture\r\nover to Ionia.\r\n\r\nFrom Ephesus Alcidas set sail in haste and fled. He had been seen by\r\nthe Salaminian and Paralian galleys, which happened to be sailing from\r\nAthens, while still at anchor off Clarus; and fearing pursuit he now\r\nmade across the open sea, fully determined to touch nowhere, if he\r\ncould help it, until he got to Peloponnese. Meanwhile news of him had\r\ncome in to Paches from the Erythraeid, and indeed from all quarters. As\r\nIonia was unfortified, great fears were felt that the Peloponnesians\r\ncoasting along shore, even if they did not intend to stay, might make\r\ndescents in passing and plunder the towns; and now the Paralian and\r\nSalaminian, having seen him at Clarus, themselves brought intelligence\r\nof the fact. Paches accordingly gave hot chase, and continued the\r\npursuit as far as the isle of Patmos, and then finding that Alcidas had\r\ngot on too far to be overtaken, came back again. Meanwhile he thought\r\nit fortunate that, as he had not fallen in with them out at sea, he had\r\nnot overtaken them anywhere where they would have been forced to\r\nencamp, and so give him the trouble of blockading them.\r\n\r\nOn his return along shore he touched, among other places, at Notium,\r\nthe port of Colophon, where the Colophonians had settled after the\r\ncapture of the upper town by Itamenes and the barbarians, who had been\r\ncalled in by certain individuals in a party quarrel. The capture of the\r\ntown took place about the time of the second Peloponnesian invasion of\r\nAttica. However, the refugees, after settling at Notium, again split up\r\ninto factions, one of which called in Arcadian and barbarian\r\nmercenaries from Pissuthnes and, entrenching these in a quarter apart,\r\nformed a new community with the Median party of the Colophonians who\r\njoined them from the upper town. Their opponents had retired into\r\nexile, and now called in Paches, who invited Hippias, the commander of\r\nthe Arcadians in the fortified quarter, to a parley, upon condition\r\nthat, if they could not agree, he was to be put back safe and sound in\r\nthe fortification. However, upon his coming out to him, he put him into\r\ncustody, though not in chains, and attacked suddenly and took by\r\nsurprise the fortification, and putting the Arcadians and the\r\nbarbarians found in it to the sword, afterwards took Hippias into it as\r\nhe had promised, and, as soon as he was inside, seized him and shot him\r\ndown. Paches then gave up Notium to the Colophonians not of the Median\r\nparty; and settlers were afterwards sent out from Athens, and the place\r\ncolonized according to Athenian laws, after collecting all the\r\nColophonians found in any of the cities.\r\n\r\nArrived at Mitylene, Paches reduced Pyrrha and Eresus; and finding the\r\nLacedaemonian, Salaethus, in hiding in the town, sent him off to\r\nAthens, together with the Mitylenians that he had placed in Tenedos,\r\nand any other persons that he thought concerned in the revolt. He also\r\nsent back the greater part of his forces, remaining with the rest to\r\nsettle Mitylene and the rest of Lesbos as he thought best.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of the prisoners with Salaethus, the Athenians at once\r\nput the latter to death, although he offered, among other things, to\r\nprocure the withdrawal of the Peloponnesians from Plataea, which was\r\nstill under siege; and after deliberating as to what they should do\r\nwith the former, in the fury of the moment determined to put to death\r\nnot only the prisoners at Athens, but the whole adult male population\r\nof Mitylene, and to make slaves of the women and children. It was\r\nremarked that Mitylene had revolted without being, like the rest,\r\nsubjected to the empire; and what above all swelled the wrath of the\r\nAthenians was the fact of the Peloponnesian fleet having ventured over\r\nto Ionia to her support, a fact which was held to argue a long\r\nmeditated rebellion. They accordingly sent a galley to communicate the\r\ndecree to Paches, commanding him to lose no time in dispatching the\r\nMitylenians. The morrow brought repentance with it and reflection on\r\nthe horrid cruelty of a decree, which condemned a whole city to the\r\nfate merited only by the guilty. This was no sooner perceived by the\r\nMitylenian ambassadors at Athens and their Athenian supporters, than\r\nthey moved the authorities to put the question again to the vote; which\r\nthey the more easily consented to do, as they themselves plainly saw\r\nthat most of the citizens wished some one to give them an opportunity\r\nfor reconsidering the matter. An assembly was therefore at once called,\r\nand after much expression of opinion upon both sides, Cleon, son of\r\nCleaenetus, the same who had carried the former motion of putting the\r\nMitylenians to death, the most violent man at Athens, and at that time\r\nby far the most powerful with the commons, came forward again and spoke\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“I have often before now been convinced that a democracy is incapable\r\nof empire, and never more so than by your present change of mind in the\r\nmatter of Mitylene. Fears or plots being unknown to you in your daily\r\nrelations with each other, you feel just the same with regard to your\r\nallies, and never reflect that the mistakes into which you may be led\r\nby listening to their appeals, or by giving way to your own compassion,\r\nare full of danger to yourselves, and bring you no thanks for your\r\nweakness from your allies; entirely forgetting that your empire is a\r\ndespotism and your subjects disaffected conspirators, whose obedience\r\nis ensured not by your suicidal concessions, but by the superiority\r\ngiven you by your own strength and not their loyalty. The most alarming\r\nfeature in the case is the constant change of measures with which we\r\nappear to be threatened, and our seeming ignorance of the fact that bad\r\nlaws which are never changed are better for a city than good ones that\r\nhave no authority; that unlearned loyalty is more serviceable than\r\nquick-witted insubordination; and that ordinary men usually manage\r\npublic affairs better than their more gifted fellows. The latter are\r\nalways wanting to appear wiser than the laws, and to overrule every\r\nproposition brought forward, thinking that they cannot show their wit\r\nin more important matters, and by such behaviour too often ruin their\r\ncountry; while those who mistrust their own cleverness are content to\r\nbe less learned than the laws, and less able to pick holes in the\r\nspeech of a good speaker; and being fair judges rather than rival\r\nathletes, generally conduct affairs successfully. These we ought to\r\nimitate, instead of being led on by cleverness and intellectual rivalry\r\nto advise your people against our real opinions.\r\n\r\n“For myself, I adhere to my former opinion, and wonder at those who\r\nhave proposed to reopen the case of the Mitylenians, and who are thus\r\ncausing a delay which is all in favour of the guilty, by making the\r\nsufferer proceed against the offender with the edge of his anger\r\nblunted; although where vengeance follows most closely upon the wrong,\r\nit best equals it and most amply requites it. I wonder also who will be\r\nthe man who will maintain the contrary, and will pretend to show that\r\nthe crimes of the Mitylenians are of service to us, and our misfortunes\r\ninjurious to the allies. Such a man must plainly either have such\r\nconfidence in his rhetoric as to adventure to prove that what has been\r\nonce for all decided is still undetermined, or be bribed to try to\r\ndelude us by elaborate sophisms. In such contests the state gives the\r\nrewards to others, and takes the dangers for herself. The persons to\r\nblame are you who are so foolish as to institute these contests; who go\r\nto see an oration as you would to see a sight, take your facts on\r\nhearsay, judge of the practicability of a project by the wit of its\r\nadvocates, and trust for the truth as to past events not to the fact\r\nwhich you saw more than to the clever strictures which you heard; the\r\neasy victims of new-fangled arguments, unwilling to follow received\r\nconclusions; slaves to every new paradox, despisers of the commonplace;\r\nthe first wish of every man being that he could speak himself, the next\r\nto rival those who can speak by seeming to be quite up with their ideas\r\nby applauding every hit almost before it is made, and by being as quick\r\nin catching an argument as you are slow in foreseeing its consequences;\r\nasking, if I may so say, for something different from the conditions\r\nunder which we live, and yet comprehending inadequately those very\r\nconditions; very slaves to the pleasure of the ear, and more like the\r\naudience of a rhetorician than the council of a city.\r\n\r\n“In order to keep you from this, I proceed to show that no one state\r\nhas ever injured you as much as Mitylene. I can make allowance for\r\nthose who revolt because they cannot bear our empire, or who have been\r\nforced to do so by the enemy. But for those who possessed an island\r\nwith fortifications; who could fear our enemies only by sea, and there\r\nhad their own force of galleys to protect them; who were independent\r\nand held in the highest honour by you—to act as these have done, this\r\nis not revolt—revolt implies oppression; it is deliberate and wanton\r\naggression; an attempt to ruin us by siding with our bitterest enemies;\r\na worse offence than a war undertaken on their own account in the\r\nacquisition of power. The fate of those of their neighbours who had\r\nalready rebelled and had been subdued was no lesson to them; their own\r\nprosperity could not dissuade them from affronting danger; but blindly\r\nconfident in the future, and full of hopes beyond their power though\r\nnot beyond their ambition, they declared war and made their decision to\r\nprefer might to right, their attack being determined not by provocation\r\nbut by the moment which seemed propitious. The truth is that great good\r\nfortune coming suddenly and unexpectedly tends to make a people\r\ninsolent; in most cases it is safer for mankind to have success in\r\nreason than out of reason; and it is easier for them, one may say, to\r\nstave off adversity than to preserve prosperity. Our mistake has been\r\nto distinguish the Mitylenians as we have done: had they been long ago\r\ntreated like the rest, they never would have so far forgotten\r\nthemselves, human nature being as surely made arrogant by consideration\r\nas it is awed by firmness. Let them now therefore be punished as their\r\ncrime requires, and do not, while you condemn the aristocracy, absolve\r\nthe people. This is certain, that all attacked you without distinction,\r\nalthough they might have come over to us and been now again in\r\npossession of their city. But no, they thought it safer to throw in\r\ntheir lot with the aristocracy and so joined their rebellion! Consider\r\ntherefore: if you subject to the same punishment the ally who is forced\r\nto rebel by the enemy, and him who does so by his own free choice,\r\nwhich of them, think you, is there that will not rebel upon the\r\nslightest pretext; when the reward of success is freedom, and the\r\npenalty of failure nothing so very terrible? We meanwhile shall have to\r\nrisk our money and our lives against one state after another; and if\r\nsuccessful, shall receive a ruined town from which we can no longer\r\ndraw the revenue upon which our strength depends; while if\r\nunsuccessful, we shall have an enemy the more upon our hands, and shall\r\nspend the time that might be employed in combating our existing foes in\r\nwarring with our own allies.\r\n\r\n“No hope, therefore, that rhetoric may instil or money purchase, of the\r\nmercy due to human infirmity must be held out to the Mitylenians. Their\r\noffence was not involuntary, but of malice and deliberate; and mercy is\r\nonly for unwilling offenders. I therefore, now as before, persist\r\nagainst your reversing your first decision, or giving way to the three\r\nfailings most fatal to empire—pity, sentiment, and indulgence.\r\nCompassion is due to those who can reciprocate the feeling, not to\r\nthose who will never pity us in return, but are our natural and\r\nnecessary foes: the orators who charm us with sentiment may find other\r\nless important arenas for their talents, in the place of one where the\r\ncity pays a heavy penalty for a momentary pleasure, themselves\r\nreceiving fine acknowledgments for their fine phrases; while indulgence\r\nshould be shown towards those who will be our friends in future,\r\ninstead of towards men who will remain just what they were, and as much\r\nour enemies as before. To sum up shortly, I say that if you follow my\r\nadvice you will do what is just towards the Mitylenians, and at the\r\nsame time expedient; while by a different decision you will not oblige\r\nthem so much as pass sentence upon yourselves. For if they were right\r\nin rebelling, you must be wrong in ruling. However, if, right or wrong,\r\nyou determine to rule, you must carry out your principle and punish the\r\nMitylenians as your interest requires; or else you must give up your\r\nempire and cultivate honesty without danger. Make up your minds,\r\ntherefore, to give them like for like; and do not let the victims who\r\nescaped the plot be more insensible than the conspirators who hatched\r\nit; but reflect what they would have done if victorious over you,\r\nespecially they were the aggressors. It is they who wrong their\r\nneighbour without a cause, that pursue their victim to the death, on\r\naccount of the danger which they foresee in letting their enemy\r\nsurvive; since the object of a wanton wrong is more dangerous, if he\r\nescape, than an enemy who has not this to complain of. Do not,\r\ntherefore, be traitors to yourselves, but recall as nearly as possible\r\nthe moment of suffering and the supreme importance which you then\r\nattached to their reduction; and now pay them back in their turn,\r\nwithout yielding to present weakness or forgetting the peril that once\r\nhung over you. Punish them as they deserve, and teach your other allies\r\nby a striking example that the penalty of rebellion is death. Let them\r\nonce understand this and you will not have so often to neglect your\r\nenemies while you are fighting with your own confederates.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Cleon. After him Diodotus, son of Eucrates, who\r\nhad also in the previous assembly spoken most strongly against putting\r\nthe Mitylenians to death, came forward and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“I do not blame the persons who have reopened the case of the\r\nMitylenians, nor do I approve the protests which we have heard against\r\nimportant questions being frequently debated. I think the two things\r\nmost opposed to good counsel are haste and passion; haste usually goes\r\nhand in hand with folly, passion with coarseness and narrowness of\r\nmind. As for the argument that speech ought not to be the exponent of\r\naction, the man who uses it must be either senseless or interested:\r\nsenseless if he believes it possible to treat of the uncertain future\r\nthrough any other medium; interested if, wishing to carry a disgraceful\r\nmeasure and doubting his ability to speak well in a bad cause, he\r\nthinks to frighten opponents and hearers by well-aimed calumny. What is\r\nstill more intolerable is to accuse a speaker of making a display in\r\norder to be paid for it. If ignorance only were imputed, an\r\nunsuccessful speaker might retire with a reputation for honesty, if not\r\nfor wisdom; while the charge of dishonesty makes him suspected, if\r\nsuccessful, and thought, if defeated, not only a fool but a rogue. The\r\ncity is no gainer by such a system, since fear deprives it of its\r\nadvisers; although in truth, if our speakers are to make such\r\nassertions, it would be better for the country if they could not speak\r\nat all, as we should then make fewer blunders. The good citizen ought\r\nto triumph not by frightening his opponents but by beating them fairly\r\nin argument; and a wise city, without over-distinguishing its best\r\nadvisers, will nevertheless not deprive them of their due, and, far\r\nfrom punishing an unlucky counsellor, will not even regard him as\r\ndisgraced. In this way successful orators would be least tempted to\r\nsacrifice their convictions to popularity, in the hope of still higher\r\nhonours, and unsuccessful speakers to resort to the same popular arts\r\nin order to win over the multitude.\r\n\r\n“This is not our way; and, besides, the moment that a man is suspected\r\nof giving advice, however good, from corrupt motives, we feel such a\r\ngrudge against him for the gain which after all we are not certain he\r\nwill receive, that we deprive the city of its certain benefit. Plain\r\ngood advice has thus come to be no less suspected than bad; and the\r\nadvocate of the most monstrous measures is not more obliged to use\r\ndeceit to gain the people, than the best counsellor is to lie in order\r\nto be believed. The city and the city only, owing to these refinements,\r\ncan never be served openly and without disguise; he who does serve it\r\nopenly being always suspected of serving himself in some secret way in\r\nreturn. Still, considering the magnitude of the interests involved, and\r\nthe position of affairs, we orators must make it our business to look a\r\nlittle farther than you who judge offhand; especially as we, your\r\nadvisers, are responsible, while you, our audience, are not so. For if\r\nthose who gave the advice, and those who took it, suffered equally, you\r\nwould judge more calmly; as it is, you visit the disasters into which\r\nthe whim of the moment may have led you upon the single person of your\r\nadviser, not upon yourselves, his numerous companions in error.\r\n\r\n“However, I have not come forward either to oppose or to accuse in the\r\nmatter of Mitylene; indeed, the question before us as sensible men is\r\nnot their guilt, but our interests. Though I prove them ever so guilty,\r\nI shall not, therefore, advise their death, unless it be expedient; nor\r\nthough they should have claims to indulgence, shall I recommend it,\r\nunless it be dearly for the good of the country. I consider that we are\r\ndeliberating for the future more than for the present; and where Cleon\r\nis so positive as to the useful deterrent effects that will follow from\r\nmaking rebellion capital, I, who consider the interests of the future\r\nquite as much as he, as positively maintain the contrary. And I require\r\nyou not to reject my useful considerations for his specious ones: his\r\nspeech may have the attraction of seeming the more just in your present\r\ntemper against Mitylene; but we are not in a court of justice, but in a\r\npolitical assembly; and the question is not justice, but how to make\r\nthe Mitylenians useful to Athens.\r\n\r\n“Now of course communities have enacted the penalty of death for many\r\noffences far lighter than this: still hope leads men to venture, and no\r\none ever yet put himself in peril without the inward conviction that he\r\nwould succeed in his design. Again, was there ever city rebelling that\r\ndid not believe that it possessed either in itself or in its alliances\r\nresources adequate to the enterprise? All, states and individuals, are\r\nalike prone to err, and there is no law that will prevent them; or why\r\nshould men have exhausted the list of punishments in search of\r\nenactments to protect them from evildoers? It is probable that in early\r\ntimes the penalties for the greatest offences were less severe, and\r\nthat, as these were disregarded, the penalty of death has been by\r\ndegrees in most cases arrived at, which is itself disregarded in like\r\nmanner. Either then some means of terror more terrible than this must\r\nbe discovered, or it must be owned that this restraint is useless; and\r\nthat as long as poverty gives men the courage of necessity, or plenty\r\nfills them with the ambition which belongs to insolence and pride, and\r\nthe other conditions of life remain each under the thraldom of some\r\nfatal and master passion, so long will the impulse never be wanting to\r\ndrive men into danger. Hope also and cupidity, the one leading and the\r\nother following, the one conceiving the attempt, the other suggesting\r\nthe facility of succeeding, cause the widest ruin, and, although\r\ninvisible agents, are far stronger than the dangers that are seen.\r\nFortune, too, powerfully helps the delusion and, by the unexpected aid\r\nthat she sometimes lends, tempts men to venture with inferior means;\r\nand this is especially the case with communities, because the stakes\r\nplayed for are the highest, freedom or empire, and, when all are acting\r\ntogether, each man irrationally magnifies his own capacity. In fine, it\r\nis impossible to prevent, and only great simplicity can hope to\r\nprevent, human nature doing what it has once set its mind upon, by\r\nforce of law or by any other deterrent force whatsoever.\r\n\r\n“We must not, therefore, commit ourselves to a false policy through a\r\nbelief in the efficacy of the punishment of death, or exclude rebels\r\nfrom the hope of repentance and an early atonement of their error.\r\nConsider a moment. At present, if a city that has already revolted\r\nperceive that it cannot succeed, it will come to terms while it is\r\nstill able to refund expenses, and pay tribute afterwards. In the other\r\ncase, what city, think you, would not prepare better than is now done,\r\nand hold out to the last against its besiegers, if it is all one\r\nwhether it surrender late or soon? And how can it be otherwise than\r\nhurtful to us to be put to the expense of a siege, because surrender is\r\nout of the question; and if we take the city, to receive a ruined town\r\nfrom which we can no longer draw the revenue which forms our real\r\nstrength against the enemy? We must not, therefore, sit as strict\r\njudges of the offenders to our own prejudice, but rather see how by\r\nmoderate chastisements we may be enabled to benefit in future by the\r\nrevenue-producing powers of our dependencies; and we must make up our\r\nminds to look for our protection not to legal terrors but to careful\r\nadministration. At present we do exactly the opposite. When a free\r\ncommunity, held in subjection by force, rises, as is only natural, and\r\nasserts its independence, it is no sooner reduced than we fancy\r\nourselves obliged to punish it severely; although the right course with\r\nfreemen is not to chastise them rigorously when they do rise, but\r\nrigorously to watch them before they rise, and to prevent their ever\r\nentertaining the idea, and, the insurrection suppressed, to make as few\r\nresponsible for it as possible.\r\n\r\n“Only consider what a blunder you would commit in doing as Cleon\r\nrecommends. As things are at present, in all the cities the people is\r\nyour friend, and either does not revolt with the oligarchy, or, if\r\nforced to do so, becomes at once the enemy of the insurgents; so that\r\nin the war with the hostile city you have the masses on your side. But\r\nif you butcher the people of Mitylene, who had nothing to do with the\r\nrevolt, and who, as soon as they got arms, of their own motion\r\nsurrendered the town, first you will commit the crime of killing your\r\nbenefactors; and next you will play directly into the hands of the\r\nhigher classes, who when they induce their cities to rise, will\r\nimmediately have the people on their side, through your having\r\nannounced in advance the same punishment for those who are guilty and\r\nfor those who are not. On the contrary, even if they were guilty, you\r\nought to seem not to notice it, in order to avoid alienating the only\r\nclass still friendly to us. In short, I consider it far more useful for\r\nthe preservation of our empire voluntarily to put up with injustice,\r\nthan to put to death, however justly, those whom it is our interest to\r\nkeep alive. As for Cleon’s idea that in punishment the claims of\r\njustice and expediency can both be satisfied, facts do not confirm the\r\npossibility of such a combination.\r\n\r\n“Confess, therefore, that this is the wisest course, and without\r\nconceding too much either to pity or to indulgence, by neither of which\r\nmotives do I any more than Cleon wish you to be influenced, upon the\r\nplain merits of the case before you, be persuaded by me to try calmly\r\nthose of the Mitylenians whom Paches sent off as guilty, and to leave\r\nthe rest undisturbed. This is at once best for the future, and most\r\nterrible to your enemies at the present moment; inasmuch as good policy\r\nagainst an adversary is superior to the blind attacks of brute force.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Diodotus. The two opinions thus expressed were\r\nthe ones that most directly contradicted each other; and the Athenians,\r\nnotwithstanding their change of feeling, now proceeded to a division,\r\nin which the show of hands was almost equal, although the motion of\r\nDiodotus carried the day. Another galley was at once sent off in haste,\r\nfor fear that the first might reach Lesbos in the interval, and the\r\ncity be found destroyed; the first ship having about a day and a\r\nnight’s start. Wine and barley-cakes were provided for the vessel by\r\nthe Mitylenian ambassadors, and great promises made if they arrived in\r\ntime; which caused the men to use such diligence upon the voyage that\r\nthey took their meals of barley-cakes kneaded with oil and wine as they\r\nrowed, and only slept by turns while the others were at the oar.\r\nLuckily they met with no contrary wind, and the first ship making no\r\nhaste upon so horrid an errand, while the second pressed on in the\r\nmanner described, the first arrived so little before them, that Paches\r\nhad only just had time to read the decree, and to prepare to execute\r\nthe sentence, when the second put into port and prevented the massacre.\r\nThe danger of Mitylene had indeed been great.\r\n\r\nThe other party whom Paches had sent off as the prime movers in the\r\nrebellion, were upon Cleon’s motion put to death by the Athenians, the\r\nnumber being rather more than a thousand. The Athenians also demolished\r\nthe walls of the Mitylenians, and took possession of their ships.\r\nAfterwards tribute was not imposed upon the Lesbians; but all their\r\nland, except that of the Methymnians, was divided into three thousand\r\nallotments, three hundred of which were reserved as sacred for the\r\ngods, and the rest assigned by lot to Athenian shareholders, who were\r\nsent out to the island. With these the Lesbians agreed to pay a rent of\r\ntwo minae a year for each allotment, and cultivated the land\r\nthemselves. The Athenians also took possession of the towns on the\r\ncontinent belonging to the Mitylenians, which thus became for the\r\nfuture subject to Athens. Such were the events that took place at\r\nLesbos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\n\r\nFifth Year of the War—Trial and Execution of the Plataeans— Corcyraean\r\nRevolution\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the same summer, after the reduction of Lesbos, the Athenians\r\nunder Nicias, son of Niceratus, made an expedition against the island\r\nof Minoa, which lies off Megara and was used as a fortified post by the\r\nMegarians, who had built a tower upon it. Nicias wished to enable the\r\nAthenians to maintain their blockade from this nearer station instead\r\nof from Budorum and Salamis; to stop the Peloponnesian galleys and\r\nprivateers sailing out unobserved from the island, as they had been in\r\nthe habit of doing; and at the same time prevent anything from coming\r\ninto Megara. Accordingly, after taking two towers projecting on the\r\nside of Nisaea, by engines from the sea, and clearing the entrance into\r\nthe channel between the island and the shore, he next proceeded to cut\r\noff all communication by building a wall on the mainland at the point\r\nwhere a bridge across a morass enabled succours to be thrown into the\r\nisland, which was not far off from the continent. A few days sufficing\r\nto accomplish this, he afterwards raised some works in the island also,\r\nand leaving a garrison there, departed with his forces.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time in this summer, the Plataeans, being now without\r\nprovisions and unable to support the siege, surrendered to the\r\nPeloponnesians in the following manner. An assault had been made upon\r\nthe wall, which the Plataeans were unable to repel. The Lacedaemonian\r\ncommander, perceiving their weakness, wished to avoid taking the place\r\nby storm; his instructions from Lacedaemon having been so conceived, in\r\norder that if at any future time peace should be made with Athens, and\r\nthey should agree each to restore the places that they had taken in the\r\nwar, Plataea might be held to have come over voluntarily, and not be\r\nincluded in the list. He accordingly sent a herald to them to ask if\r\nthey were willing voluntarily to surrender the town to the\r\nLacedaemonians, and accept them as their judges, upon the understanding\r\nthat the guilty should be punished, but no one without form of law. The\r\nPlataeans were now in the last state of weakness, and the herald had no\r\nsooner delivered his message than they surrendered the town. The\r\nPeloponnesians fed them for some days until the judges from Lacedaemon,\r\nwho were five in number, arrived. Upon their arrival no charge was\r\npreferred; they simply called up the Plataeans, and asked them whether\r\nthey had done the Lacedaemonians and allies any service in the war then\r\nraging. The Plataeans asked leave to speak at greater length, and\r\ndeputed two of their number to represent them: Astymachus, son of\r\nAsopolaus, and Lacon, son of Aeimnestus, proxenus of the\r\nLacedaemonians, who came forward and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“Lacedaemonians, when we surrendered our city we trusted in you, and\r\nlooked forward to a trial more agreeable to the forms of law than the\r\npresent, to which we had no idea of being subjected; the judges also in\r\nwhose hands we consented to place ourselves were you, and you only\r\n(from whom we thought we were most likely to obtain justice), and not\r\nother persons, as is now the case. As matters stand, we are afraid that\r\nwe have been doubly deceived. We have good reason to suspect, not only\r\nthat the issue to be tried is the most terrible of all, but that you\r\nwill not prove impartial; if we may argue from the fact that no\r\naccusation was first brought forward for us to answer, but we had\r\nourselves to ask leave to speak, and from the question being put so\r\nshortly, that a true answer to it tells against us, while a false one\r\ncan be contradicted. In this dilemma, our safest, and indeed our only\r\ncourse, seems to be to say something at all risks: placed as we are, we\r\ncould scarcely be silent without being tormented by the damning thought\r\nthat speaking might have saved us. Another difficulty that we have to\r\nencounter is the difficulty of convincing you. Were we unknown to each\r\nother we might profit by bringing forward new matter with which you\r\nwere unacquainted: as it is, we can tell you nothing that you do not\r\nknow already, and we fear, not that you have condemned us in your own\r\nminds of having failed in our duty towards you, and make this our\r\ncrime, but that to please a third party we have to submit to a trial\r\nthe result of which is already decided. Nevertheless, we will place\r\nbefore you what we can justly urge, not only on the question of the\r\nquarrel which the Thebans have against us, but also as addressing you\r\nand the rest of the Hellenes; and we will remind you of our good\r\nservices, and endeavour to prevail with you.\r\n\r\n“To your short question, whether we have done the Lacedaemonians and\r\nallies any service in this war, we say, if you ask us as enemies, that\r\nto refrain from serving you was not to do you injury; if as friends,\r\nthat you are more in fault for having marched against us. During the\r\npeace, and against the Mede, we acted well: we have not now been the\r\nfirst to break the peace, and we were the only Boeotians who then\r\njoined in defending against the Mede the liberty of Hellas. Although an\r\ninland people, we were present at the action at Artemisium; in the\r\nbattle that took place in our territory we fought by the side of\r\nyourselves and Pausanias; and in all the other Hellenic exploits of the\r\ntime we took a part quite out of proportion to our strength. Besides,\r\nyou, as Lacedaemonians, ought not to forget that at the time of the\r\ngreat panic at Sparta, after the earthquake, caused by the secession of\r\nthe Helots to Ithome, we sent the third part of our citizens to assist\r\nyou.\r\n\r\n“On these great and historical occasions such was the part that we\r\nchose, although afterwards we became your enemies. For this you were to\r\nblame. When we asked for your alliance against our Theban oppressors,\r\nyou rejected our petition, and told us to go to the Athenians who were\r\nour neighbours, as you lived too far off. In the war we never have done\r\nto you, and never should have done to you, anything unreasonable. If we\r\nrefused to desert the Athenians when you asked us, we did no wrong;\r\nthey had helped us against the Thebans when you drew back, and we could\r\nno longer give them up with honour; especially as we had obtained their\r\nalliance and had been admitted to their citizenship at our own request,\r\nand after receiving benefits at their hands; but it was plainly our\r\nduty loyally to obey their orders. Besides, the faults that either of\r\nyou may commit in your supremacy must be laid, not upon the followers,\r\nbut on the chiefs that lead them astray.\r\n\r\n“With regard to the Thebans, they have wronged us repeatedly, and their\r\nlast aggression, which has been the means of bringing us into our\r\npresent position, is within your own knowledge. In seizing our city in\r\ntime of peace, and what is more at a holy time in the month, they\r\njustly encountered our vengeance, in accordance with the universal law\r\nwhich sanctions resistance to an invader; and it cannot now be right\r\nthat we should suffer on their account. By taking your own immediate\r\ninterest and their animosity as the test of justice, you will prove\r\nyourselves to be rather waiters on expediency than judges of right;\r\nalthough if they seem useful to you now, we and the rest of the\r\nHellenes gave you much more valuable help at a time of greater need.\r\nNow you are the assailants, and others fear you; but at the crisis to\r\nwhich we allude, when the barbarian threatened all with slavery, the\r\nThebans were on his side. It is just, therefore, to put our patriotism\r\nthen against our error now, if error there has been; and you will find\r\nthe merit outweighing the fault, and displayed at a juncture when there\r\nwere few Hellenes who would set their valour against the strength of\r\nXerxes, and when greater praise was theirs who preferred the dangerous\r\npath of honour to the safe course of consulting their own interest with\r\nrespect to the invasion. To these few we belonged, and highly were we\r\nhonoured for it; and yet we now fear to perish by having again acted on\r\nthe same principles, and chosen to act well with Athens sooner than\r\nwisely with Sparta. Yet in justice the same cases should be decided in\r\nthe same way, and policy should not mean anything else than lasting\r\ngratitude for the service of good ally combined with a proper attention\r\nto one’s own immediate interest.\r\n\r\n“Consider also that at present the Hellenes generally regard you as a\r\npattern of worth and honour; and if you pass an unjust sentence upon us\r\nin this which is no obscure cause, but one in which you, the judges,\r\nare as illustrious as we, the prisoners, are blameless, take care that\r\ndispleasure be not felt at an unworthy decision in the matter of\r\nhonourable men made by men yet more honourable than they, and at the\r\nconsecration in the national temples of spoils taken from the\r\nPlataeans, the benefactors of Hellas. Shocking indeed will it seem for\r\nLacedaemonians to destroy Plataea, and for the city whose name your\r\nfathers inscribed upon the tripod at Delphi for its good service, to be\r\nby you blotted out from the map of Hellas, to please the Thebans. To\r\nsuch a depth of misfortune have we fallen that, while the Medes’\r\nsuccess had been our ruin, Thebans now supplant us in your once fond\r\nregards; and we have been subjected to two dangers, the greatest of\r\nany—that of dying of starvation then, if we had not surrendered our\r\ntown, and now of being tried for our lives. So that we Plataeans, after\r\nexertions beyond our power in the cause of the Hellenes, are rejected\r\nby all, forsaken and unassisted; helped by none of our allies, and\r\nreduced to doubt the stability of our only hope, yourselves.\r\n\r\n“Still, in the name of the gods who once presided over our confederacy,\r\nand of our own good service in the Hellenic cause, we adjure you to\r\nrelent; to recall the decision which we fear that the Thebans may have\r\nobtained from you; to ask back the gift that you have given them, that\r\nthey disgrace not you by slaying us; to gain a pure instead of a guilty\r\ngratitude, and not to gratify others to be yourselves rewarded with\r\nshame. Our lives may be quickly taken, but it will be a heavy task to\r\nwipe away the infamy of the deed; as we are no enemies whom you might\r\njustly punish, but friends forced into taking arms against you. To\r\ngrant us our lives would be, therefore, a righteous judgment; if you\r\nconsider also that we are prisoners who surrendered of their own\r\naccord, stretching out our hands for quarter, whose slaughter Hellenic\r\nlaw forbids, and who besides were always your benefactors. Look at the\r\nsepulchres of your fathers, slain by the Medes and buried in our\r\ncountry, whom year by year we honoured with garments and all other\r\ndues, and the first-fruits of all that our land produced in their\r\nseason, as friends from a friendly country and allies to our old\r\ncompanions in arms. Should you not decide aright, your conduct would be\r\nthe very opposite to ours. Consider only: Pausanias buried them\r\nthinking that he was laying them in friendly ground and among men as\r\nfriendly; but you, if you kill us and make the Plataean territory\r\nTheban, will leave your fathers and kinsmen in a hostile soil and among\r\ntheir murderers, deprived of the honours which they now enjoy. What is\r\nmore, you will enslave the land in which the freedom of the Hellenes\r\nwas won, make desolate the temples of the gods to whom they prayed\r\nbefore they overcame the Medes, and take away your ancestral sacrifices\r\nfrom those who founded and instituted them.\r\n\r\n“It were not to your glory, Lacedaemonians, either to offend in this\r\nway against the common law of the Hellenes and against your own\r\nancestors, or to kill us your benefactors to gratify another’s hatred\r\nwithout having been wronged yourselves: it were more so to spare us and\r\nto yield to the impressions of a reasonable compassion; reflecting not\r\nmerely on the awful fate in store for us, but also on the character of\r\nthe sufferers, and on the impossibility of predicting how soon\r\nmisfortune may fall even upon those who deserve it not. We, as we have\r\na right to do and as our need impels us, entreat you, calling aloud\r\nupon the gods at whose common altar all the Hellenes worship, to hear\r\nour request, to be not unmindful of the oaths which your fathers swore,\r\nand which we now plead—we supplicate you by the tombs of your fathers,\r\nand appeal to those that are gone to save us from falling into the\r\nhands of the Thebans and their dearest friends from being given up to\r\ntheir most detested foes. We also remind you of that day on which we\r\ndid the most glorious deeds, by your fathers’ sides, we who now on this\r\nare like to suffer the most dreadful fate. Finally, to do what is\r\nnecessary and yet most difficult for men in our situation—that is, to\r\nmake an end of speaking, since with that ending the peril of our lives\r\ndraws near—in conclusion we say that we did not surrender our city to\r\nthe Thebans (to that we would have preferred inglorious starvation),\r\nbut trusted in and capitulated to you; and it would be just, if we fail\r\nto persuade you, to put us back in the same position and let us take\r\nthe chance that falls to us. And at the same time we adjure you not to\r\ngive us up—your suppliants, Lacedaemonians, out of your hands and\r\nfaith, Plataeans foremost of the Hellenic patriots, to Thebans, our\r\nmost hated enemies—but to be our saviours, and not, while you free the\r\nrest of the Hellenes, to bring us to destruction.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of the Plataeans. The Thebans, afraid that the\r\nLacedaemonians might be moved by what they had heard, came forward and\r\nsaid that they too desired to address them, since the Plataeans had,\r\nagainst their wish, been allowed to speak at length instead of being\r\nconfined to a simple answer to the question. Leave being granted, the\r\nThebans spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“We should never have asked to make this speech if the Plataeans on\r\ntheir side had contented themselves with shortly answering the\r\nquestion, and had not turned round and made charges against us, coupled\r\nwith a long defence of themselves upon matters outside the present\r\ninquiry and not even the subject of accusation, and with praise of what\r\nno one finds fault with. However, since they have done so, we must\r\nanswer their charges and refute their self-praise, in order that\r\nneither our bad name nor their good may help them, but that you may\r\nhear the real truth on both points, and so decide.\r\n\r\n“The origin of our quarrel was this. We settled Plataea some time after\r\nthe rest of Boeotia, together with other places out of which we had\r\ndriven the mixed population. The Plataeans not choosing to recognize\r\nour supremacy, as had been first arranged, but separating themselves\r\nfrom the rest of the Boeotians, and proving traitors to their\r\nnationality, we used compulsion; upon which they went over to the\r\nAthenians, and with them did as much harm, for which we retaliated.\r\n\r\n“Next, when the barbarian invaded Hellas, they say that they were the\r\nonly Boeotians who did not Medize; and this is where they most glorify\r\nthemselves and abuse us. We say that if they did not Medize, it was\r\nbecause the Athenians did not do so either; just as afterwards when the\r\nAthenians attacked the Hellenes they, the Plataeans, were again the\r\nonly Boeotians who Atticized. And yet consider the forms of our\r\nrespective governments when we so acted. Our city at that juncture had\r\nneither an oligarchical constitution in which all the nobles enjoyed\r\nequal rights, nor a democracy, but that which is most opposed to law\r\nand good government and nearest a tyranny—the rule of a close cabal.\r\nThese, hoping to strengthen their individual power by the success of\r\nthe Mede, kept down by force the people, and brought him into the town.\r\nThe city as a whole was not its own mistress when it so acted, and\r\nought not to be reproached for the errors that it committed while\r\ndeprived of its constitution. Examine only how we acted after the\r\ndeparture of the Mede and the recovery of the constitution; when the\r\nAthenians attacked the rest of Hellas and endeavoured to subjugate our\r\ncountry, of the greater part of which faction had already made them\r\nmasters. Did not we fight and conquer at Coronea and liberate Boeotia,\r\nand do we not now actively contribute to the liberation of the rest,\r\nproviding horses to the cause and a force unequalled by that of any\r\nother state in the confederacy?\r\n\r\n“Let this suffice to excuse us for our Medism. We will now endeavour to\r\nshow that you have injured the Hellenes more than we, and are more\r\ndeserving of condign punishment. It was in defence against us, say you,\r\nthat you became allies and citizens of Athens. If so, you ought only to\r\nhave called in the Athenians against us, instead of joining them in\r\nattacking others: it was open to you to do this if you ever felt that\r\nthey were leading you where you did not wish to follow, as Lacedaemon\r\nwas already your ally against the Mede, as you so much insist; and this\r\nwas surely sufficient to keep us off, and above all to allow you to\r\ndeliberate in security. Nevertheless, of your own choice and without\r\ncompulsion you chose to throw your lot in with Athens. And you say that\r\nit had been base for you to betray your benefactors; but it was surely\r\nfar baser and more iniquitous to sacrifice the whole body of the\r\nHellenes, your fellow confederates, who were liberating Hellas, than\r\nthe Athenians only, who were enslaving it. The return that you made\r\nthem was therefore neither equal nor honourable, since you called them\r\nin, as you say, because you were being oppressed yourselves, and then\r\nbecame their accomplices in oppressing others; although baseness rather\r\nconsists in not returning like for like than in not returning what is\r\njustly due but must be unjustly paid.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile, after thus plainly showing that it was not for the sake of\r\nthe Hellenes that you alone then did not Medize, but because the\r\nAthenians did not do so either, and you wished to side with them and to\r\nbe against the rest; you now claim the benefit of good deeds done to\r\nplease your neighbours. This cannot be admitted: you chose the\r\nAthenians, and with them you must stand or fall. Nor can you plead the\r\nleague then made and claim that it should now protect you. You\r\nabandoned that league, and offended against it by helping instead of\r\nhindering the subjugation of the Aeginetans and others of its members,\r\nand that not under compulsion, but while in enjoyment of the same\r\ninstitutions that you enjoy to the present hour, and no one forcing you\r\nas in our case. Lastly, an invitation was addressed to you before you\r\nwere blockaded to be neutral and join neither party: this you did not\r\naccept. Who then merit the detestation of the Hellenes more justly than\r\nyou, you who sought their ruin under the mask of honour? The former\r\nvirtues that you allege you now show not to be proper to your\r\ncharacter; the real bent of your nature has been at length damningly\r\nproved: when the Athenians took the path of injustice you followed\r\nthem.\r\n\r\n“Of our unwilling Medism and your wilful Atticizing this then is our\r\nexplanation. The last wrong wrong of which you complain consists in our\r\nhaving, as you say, lawlessly invaded your town in time of peace and\r\nfestival. Here again we cannot think that we were more in fault than\r\nyourselves. If of our own proper motion we made an armed attack upon\r\nyour city and ravaged your territory, we are guilty; but if the first\r\nmen among you in estate and family, wishing to put an end to the\r\nforeign connection and to restore you to the common Boeotian country,\r\nof their own free will invited us, wherein is our crime? Where wrong is\r\ndone, those who lead, as you say, are more to blame than those who\r\nfollow. Not that, in our judgment, wrong was done either by them or by\r\nus. Citizens like yourselves, and with more at stake than you, they\r\nopened their own walls and introduced us into their own city, not as\r\nfoes but as friends, to prevent the bad among you from becoming worse;\r\nto give honest men their due; to reform principles without attacking\r\npersons, since you were not to be banished from your city, but brought\r\nhome to your kindred, nor to be made enemies to any, but friends alike\r\nto all.\r\n\r\n“That our intention was not hostile is proved by our behaviour. We did\r\nno harm to any one, but publicly invited those who wished to live under\r\na national, Boeotian government to come over to us; which as first you\r\ngladly did, and made an agreement with us and remained tranquil, until\r\nyou became aware of the smallness of our numbers. Now it is possible\r\nthat there may have been something not quite fair in our entering\r\nwithout the consent of your commons. At any rate you did not repay us\r\nin kind. Instead of refraining, as we had done, from violence, and\r\ninducing us to retire by negotiation, you fell upon us in violation of\r\nyour agreement, and slew some of us in fight, of which we do not so\r\nmuch complain, for in that there was a certain justice; but others who\r\nheld out their hands and received quarter, and whose lives you\r\nsubsequently promised us, you lawlessly butchered. If this was not\r\nabominable, what is? And after these three crimes committed one after\r\nthe other—the violation of your agreement, the murder of the men\r\nafterwards, and the lying breach of your promise not to kill them, if\r\nwe refrained from injuring your property in the country—you still\r\naffirm that we are the criminals and yourselves pretend to escape\r\njustice. Not so, if these your judges decide aright, but you will be\r\npunished for all together.\r\n\r\n“Such, Lacedaemonians, are the facts. We have gone into them at some\r\nlength both on your account and on our own, that you may fed that you\r\nwill justly condemn the prisoners, and we, that we have given an\r\nadditional sanction to our vengeance. We would also prevent you from\r\nbeing melted by hearing of their past virtues, if any such they had:\r\nthese may be fairly appealed to by the victims of injustice, but only\r\naggravate the guilt of criminals, since they offend against their\r\nbetter nature. Nor let them gain anything by crying and wailing, by\r\ncalling upon your fathers’ tombs and their own desolate condition.\r\nAgainst this we point to the far more dreadful fate of our youth,\r\nbutchered at their hands; the fathers of whom either fell at Coronea,\r\nbringing Boeotia over to you, or seated, forlorn old men by desolate\r\nhearths, with far more reason implore your justice upon the prisoners.\r\nThe pity which they appeal to is rather due to men who suffer\r\nunworthily; those who suffer justly as they do are on the contrary\r\nsubjects for triumph. For their present desolate condition they have\r\nthemselves to blame, since they wilfully rejected the better alliance.\r\nTheir lawless act was not provoked by any action of ours: hate, not\r\njustice, inspired their decision; and even now the satisfaction which\r\nthey afford us is not adequate; they will suffer by a legal sentence,\r\nnot as they pretend as suppliants asking for quarter in battle, but as\r\nprisoners who have surrendered upon agreement to take their trial.\r\nVindicate, therefore, Lacedaemonians, the Hellenic law which they have\r\nbroken; and to us, the victims of its violation, grant the reward\r\nmerited by our zeal. Nor let us be supplanted in your favour by their\r\nharangues, but offer an example to the Hellenes, that the contests to\r\nwhich you invite them are of deeds, not words: good deeds can be\r\nshortly stated, but where wrong is done a wealth of language is needed\r\nto veil its deformity. However, if leading powers were to do what you\r\nare now doing, and putting one short question to all alike were to\r\ndecide accordingly, men would be less tempted to seek fine phrases to\r\ncover bad actions.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of the Thebans. The Lacedaemonian judges decided\r\nthat the question whether they had received any service from the\r\nPlataeans in the war, was a fair one for them to put; as they had\r\nalways invited them to be neutral, agreeably to the original covenant\r\nof Pausanias after the defeat of the Mede, and had again definitely\r\noffered them the same conditions before the blockade. This offer having\r\nbeen refused, they were now, they conceived, by the loyalty of their\r\nintention released from their covenant; and having, as they considered,\r\nsuffered evil at the hands of the Plataeans, they brought them in again\r\none by one and asked each of them the same question, that is to say,\r\nwhether they had done the Lacedaemonians and allies any service in the\r\nwar; and upon their saying that they had not, took them out and slew\r\nthem, all without exception. The number of Plataeans thus massacred was\r\nnot less than two hundred, with twenty-five Athenians who had shared in\r\nthe siege. The women were taken as slaves. The city the Thebans gave\r\nfor about a year to some political emigrants from Megara and to the\r\nsurviving Plataeans of their own party to inhabit, and afterwards razed\r\nit to the ground from the very foundations, and built on to the\r\nprecinct of Hera an inn two hundred feet square, with rooms all round\r\nabove and below, making use for this purpose of the roofs and doors of\r\nthe Plataeans: of the rest of the materials in the wall, the brass and\r\nthe iron, they made couches which they dedicated to Hera, for whom they\r\nalso built a stone chapel of a hundred feet square. The land they\r\nconfiscated and let out on a ten years’ lease to Theban occupiers. The\r\nadverse attitude of the Lacedaemonians in the whole Plataean affair was\r\nmainly adopted to please the Thebans, who were thought to be useful in\r\nthe war at that moment raging. Such was the end of Plataea, in the\r\nninety-third year after she became the ally of Athens.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, the forty ships of the Peloponnesians that had gone to the\r\nrelief of the Lesbians, and which we left flying across the open sea,\r\npursued by the Athenians, were caught in a storm off Crete, and\r\nscattering from thence made their way to Peloponnese, where they found\r\nat Cyllene thirteen Leucadian and Ambraciot galleys, with Brasidas, son\r\nof Tellis, lately arrived as counsellor to Alcidas; the Lacedaemonians,\r\nupon the failure of the Lesbian expedition, having resolved to\r\nstrengthen their fleet and sail to Corcyra, where a revolution had\r\nbroken out, so as to arrive there before the twelve Athenian ships at\r\nNaupactus could be reinforced from Athens. Brasidas and Alcidas began\r\nto prepare accordingly.\r\n\r\nThe Corcyraean revolution began with the return of the prisoners taken\r\nin the sea-fights off Epidamnus. These the Corinthians had released,\r\nnominally upon the security of eight hundred talents given by their\r\nproxeni, but in reality upon their engagement to bring over Corcyra to\r\nCorinth. These men proceeded to canvass each of the citizens, and to\r\nintrigue with the view of detaching the city from Athens. Upon the\r\narrival of an Athenian and a Corinthian vessel, with envoys on board, a\r\nconference was held in which the Corcyraeans voted to remain allies of\r\nthe Athenians according to their agreement, but to be friends of the\r\nPeloponnesians as they had been formerly. Meanwhile, the returned\r\nprisoners brought Peithias, a volunteer proxenus of the Athenians and\r\nleader of the commons, to trial, upon the charge of enslaving Corcyra\r\nto Athens. He, being acquitted, retorted by accusing five of the\r\nrichest of their number of cutting stakes in the ground sacred to Zeus\r\nand Alcinous; the legal penalty being a stater for each stake. Upon\r\ntheir conviction, the amount of the penalty being very large, they\r\nseated themselves as suppliants in the temples to be allowed to pay it\r\nby instalments; but Peithias, who was one of the senate, prevailed upon\r\nthat body to enforce the law; upon which the accused, rendered\r\ndesperate by the law, and also learning that Peithias had the\r\nintention, while still a member of the senate, to persuade the people\r\nto conclude a defensive and offensive alliance with Athens, banded\r\ntogether armed with daggers, and suddenly bursting into the senate\r\nkilled Peithias and sixty others, senators and private persons; some\r\nfew only of the party of Peithias taking refuge in the Athenian galley,\r\nwhich had not yet departed.\r\n\r\nAfter this outrage, the conspirators summoned the Corcyraeans to an\r\nassembly, and said that this would turn out for the best, and would\r\nsave them from being enslaved by Athens: for the future, they moved to\r\nreceive neither party unless they came peacefully in a single ship,\r\ntreating any larger number as enemies. This motion made, they compelled\r\nit to be adopted, and instantly sent off envoys to Athens to justify\r\nwhat had been done and to dissuade the refugees there from any hostile\r\nproceedings which might lead to a reaction.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of the embassy, the Athenians arrested the envoys and\r\nall who listened to them, as revolutionists, and lodged them in Aegina.\r\nMeanwhile a Corinthian galley arriving in the island with Lacedaemonian\r\nenvoys, the dominant Corcyraean party attacked the commons and defeated\r\nthem in battle. Night coming on, the commons took refuge in the\r\nAcropolis and the higher parts of the city, and concentrated themselves\r\nthere, having also possession of the Hyllaic harbour; their adversaries\r\noccupying the market-place, where most of them lived, and the harbour\r\nadjoining, looking towards the mainland.\r\n\r\nThe next day passed in skirmishes of little importance, each party\r\nsending into the country to offer freedom to the slaves and to invite\r\nthem to join them. The mass of the slaves answered the appeal of the\r\ncommons; their antagonists being reinforced by eight hundred\r\nmercenaries from the continent.\r\n\r\nAfter a day’s interval hostilities recommenced, victory remaining with\r\nthe commons, who had the advantage in numbers and position, the women\r\nalso valiantly assisting them, pelting with tiles from the houses, and\r\nsupporting the melee with a fortitude beyond their sex. Towards dusk,\r\nthe oligarchs in full rout, fearing that the victorious commons might\r\nassault and carry the arsenal and put them to the sword, fired the\r\nhouses round the marketplace and the lodging-houses, in order to bar\r\ntheir advance; sparing neither their own, nor those of their\r\nneighbours; by which much stuff of the merchants was consumed and the\r\ncity risked total destruction, if a wind had come to help the flame by\r\nblowing on it. Hostilities now ceasing, both sides kept quiet, passing\r\nthe night on guard, while the Corinthian ship stole out to sea upon the\r\nvictory of the commons, and most of the mercenaries passed over\r\nsecretly to the continent.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Athenian general, Nicostratus, son of Diitrephes, came\r\nup from Naupactus with twelve ships and five hundred Messenian heavy\r\ninfantry. He at once endeavoured to bring about a settlement, and\r\npersuaded the two parties to agree together to bring to trial ten of\r\nthe ringleaders, who presently fled, while the rest were to live in\r\npeace, making terms with each other, and entering into a defensive and\r\noffensive alliance with the Athenians. This arranged, he was about to\r\nsail away, when the leaders of the commons induced him to leave them\r\nfive of his ships to make their adversaries less disposed to move,\r\nwhile they manned and sent with him an equal number of their own. He\r\nhad no sooner consented, than they began to enroll their enemies for\r\nthe ships; and these, fearing that they might be sent off to Athens,\r\nseated themselves as suppliants in the temple of the Dioscuri. An\r\nattempt on the part of Nicostratus to reassure them and to persuade\r\nthem to rise proving unsuccessful, the commons armed upon this pretext,\r\nalleging the refusal of their adversaries to sail with them as a proof\r\nof the hollowness of their intentions, and took their arms out of their\r\nhouses, and would have dispatched some whom they fell in with, if\r\nNicostratus had not prevented it. The rest of the party, seeing what\r\nwas going on, seated themselves as suppliants in the temple of Hera,\r\nbeing not less than four hundred in number; until the commons, fearing\r\nthat they might adopt some desperate resolution, induced them to rise,\r\nand conveyed them over to the island in front of the temple, where\r\nprovisions were sent across to them.\r\n\r\nAt this stage in the revolution, on the fourth or fifth day after the\r\nremoval of the men to the island, the Peloponnesian ships arrived from\r\nCyllene where they had been stationed since their return from Ionia,\r\nfifty-three in number, still under the command of Alcidas, but with\r\nBrasidas also on board as his adviser; and dropping anchor at Sybota, a\r\nharbour on the mainland, at daybreak made sail for Corcyra.\r\n\r\nThe Corcyraeans in great confusion and alarm at the state of things in\r\nthe city and at the approach of the invader, at once proceeded to equip\r\nsixty vessels, which they sent out, as fast as they were manned,\r\nagainst the enemy, in spite of the Athenians recommending them to let\r\nthem sail out first, and to follow themselves afterwards with all their\r\nships together. Upon their vessels coming up to the enemy in this\r\nstraggling fashion, two immediately deserted: in others the crews were\r\nfighting among themselves, and there was no order in anything that was\r\ndone; so that the Peloponnesians, seeing their confusion, placed twenty\r\nships to oppose the Corcyraeans, and ranged the rest against the twelve\r\nAthenian ships, amongst which were the two vessels Salaminia and\r\nParalus.\r\n\r\nWhile the Corcyraeans, attacking without judgment and in small\r\ndetachments, were already crippled by their own misconduct, the\r\nAthenians, afraid of the numbers of the enemy and of being surrounded,\r\ndid not venture to attack the main body or even the centre of the\r\ndivision opposed to them, but fell upon its wing and sank one vessel;\r\nafter which the Peloponnesians formed in a circle, and the Athenians\r\nrowed round them and tried to throw them into disorder. Perceiving\r\nthis, the division opposed to the Corcyraeans, fearing a repetition of\r\nthe disaster of Naupactus, came to support their friends, and the whole\r\nfleet now bore down, united, upon the Athenians, who retired before it,\r\nbacking water, retiring as leisurely as possible in order to give the\r\nCorcyraeans time to escape, while the enemy was thus kept occupied.\r\nSuch was the character of this sea-fight, which lasted until sunset.\r\n\r\nThe Corcyraeans now feared that the enemy would follow up their victory\r\nand sail against the town and rescue the men in the island, or strike\r\nsome other blow equally decisive, and accordingly carried the men over\r\nagain to the temple of Hera, and kept guard over the city. The\r\nPeloponnesians, however, although victorious in the sea-fight, did not\r\nventure to attack the town, but took the thirteen Corcyraean vessels\r\nwhich they had captured, and with them sailed back to the continent\r\nfrom whence they had put out. The next day equally they refrained from\r\nattacking the city, although the disorder and panic were at their\r\nheight, and though Brasidas, it is said, urged Alcidas, his superior\r\nofficer, to do so, but they landed upon the promontory of Leukimme and\r\nlaid waste the country.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the commons in Corcyra, being still in great fear of the\r\nfleet attacking them, came to a parley with the suppliants and their\r\nfriends, in order to save the town; and prevailed upon some of them to\r\ngo on board the ships, of which they still manned thirty, against the\r\nexpected attack. But the Peloponnesians after ravaging the country\r\nuntil midday sailed away, and towards nightfall were informed by beacon\r\nsignals of the approach of sixty Athenian vessels from Leucas, under\r\nthe command of Eurymedon, son of Thucles; which had been sent off by\r\nthe Athenians upon the news of the revolution and of the fleet with\r\nAlcidas being about to sail for Corcyra.\r\n\r\nThe Peloponnesians accordingly at once set off in haste by night for\r\nhome, coasting along shore; and hauling their ships across the Isthmus\r\nof Leucas, in order not to be seen doubling it, so departed. The\r\nCorcyraeans, made aware of the approach of the Athenian fleet and of\r\nthe departure of the enemy, brought the Messenians from outside the\r\nwalls into the town, and ordered the fleet which they had manned to\r\nsail round into the Hyllaic harbour; and while it was so doing, slew\r\nsuch of their enemies as they laid hands on, dispatching afterwards, as\r\nthey landed them, those whom they had persuaded to go on board the\r\nships. Next they went to the sanctuary of Hera and persuaded about\r\nfifty men to take their trial, and condemned them all to death. The\r\nmass of the suppliants who had refused to do so, on seeing what was\r\ntaking place, slew each other there in the consecrated ground; while\r\nsome hanged themselves upon the trees, and others destroyed themselves\r\nas they were severally able. During seven days that Eurymedon stayed\r\nwith his sixty ships, the Corcyraeans were engaged in butchering those\r\nof their fellow citizens whom they regarded as their enemies: and\r\nalthough the crime imputed was that of attempting to put down the\r\ndemocracy, some were slain also for private hatred, others by their\r\ndebtors because of the moneys owed to them. Death thus raged in every\r\nshape; and, as usually happens at such times, there was no length to\r\nwhich violence did not go; sons were killed by their fathers, and\r\nsuppliants dragged from the altar or slain upon it; while some were\r\neven walled up in the temple of Dionysus and died there.\r\n\r\nSo bloody was the march of the revolution, and the impression which it\r\nmade was the greater as it was one of the first to occur. Later on, one\r\nmay say, the whole Hellenic world was convulsed; struggles being every,\r\nwhere made by the popular chiefs to bring in the Athenians, and by the\r\noligarchs to introduce the Lacedaemonians. In peace there would have\r\nbeen neither the pretext nor the wish to make such an invitation; but\r\nin war, with an alliance always at the command of either faction for\r\nthe hurt of their adversaries and their own corresponding advantage,\r\nopportunities for bringing in the foreigner were never wanting to the\r\nrevolutionary parties. The sufferings which revolution entailed upon\r\nthe cities were many and terrible, such as have occurred and always\r\nwill occur, as long as the nature of mankind remains the same; though\r\nin a severer or milder form, and varying in their symptoms, according\r\nto the variety of the particular cases. In peace and prosperity, states\r\nand individuals have better sentiments, because they do not find\r\nthemselves suddenly confronted with imperious necessities; but war\r\ntakes away the easy supply of daily wants, and so proves a rough\r\nmaster, that brings most men’s characters to a level with their\r\nfortunes. Revolution thus ran its course from city to city, and the\r\nplaces which it arrived at last, from having heard what had been done\r\nbefore, carried to a still greater excess the refinement of their\r\ninventions, as manifested in the cunning of their enterprises and the\r\natrocity of their reprisals. Words had to change their ordinary meaning\r\nand to take that which was now given them. Reckless audacity came to be\r\nconsidered the courage of a loyal ally; prudent hesitation, specious\r\ncowardice; moderation was held to be a cloak for unmanliness; ability\r\nto see all sides of a question, inaptness to act on any. Frantic\r\nviolence became the attribute of manliness; cautious plotting, a\r\njustifiable means of self-defence. The advocate of extreme measures was\r\nalways trustworthy; his opponent a man to be suspected. To succeed in a\r\nplot was to have a shrewd head, to divine a plot a still shrewder; but\r\nto try to provide against having to do either was to break up your\r\nparty and to be afraid of your adversaries. In fine, to forestall an\r\nintending criminal, or to suggest the idea of a crime where it was\r\nwanting, was equally commended until even blood became a weaker tie\r\nthan party, from the superior readiness of those united by the latter\r\nto dare everything without reserve; for such associations had not in\r\nview the blessings derivable from established institutions but were\r\nformed by ambition for their overthrow; and the confidence of their\r\nmembers in each other rested less on any religious sanction than upon\r\ncomplicity in crime. The fair proposals of an adversary were met with\r\njealous precautions by the stronger of the two, and not with a generous\r\nconfidence. Revenge also was held of more account than\r\nself-preservation. Oaths of reconciliation, being only proffered on\r\neither side to meet an immediate difficulty, only held good so long as\r\nno other weapon was at hand; but when opportunity offered, he who first\r\nventured to seize it and to take his enemy off his guard, thought this\r\nperfidious vengeance sweeter than an open one, since, considerations of\r\nsafety apart, success by treachery won him the palm of superior\r\nintelligence. Indeed it is generally the case that men are readier to\r\ncall rogues clever than simpletons honest, and are as ashamed of being\r\nthe second as they are proud of being the first. The cause of all these\r\nevils was the lust for power arising from greed and ambition; and from\r\nthese passions proceeded the violence of parties once engaged in\r\ncontention. The leaders in the cities, each provided with the fairest\r\nprofessions, on the one side with the cry of political equality of the\r\npeople, on the other of a moderate aristocracy, sought prizes for\r\nthemselves in those public interests which they pretended to cherish,\r\nand, recoiling from no means in their struggles for ascendancy engaged\r\nin the direst excesses; in their acts of vengeance they went to even\r\ngreater lengths, not stopping at what justice or the good of the state\r\ndemanded, but making the party caprice of the moment their only\r\nstandard, and invoking with equal readiness the condemnation of an\r\nunjust verdict or the authority of the strong arm to glut the\r\nanimosities of the hour. Thus religion was in honour with neither\r\nparty; but the use of fair phrases to arrive at guilty ends was in high\r\nreputation. Meanwhile the moderate part of the citizens perished\r\nbetween the two, either for not joining in the quarrel, or because envy\r\nwould not suffer them to escape.\r\n\r\nThus every form of iniquity took root in the Hellenic countries by\r\nreason of the troubles. The ancient simplicity into which honour so\r\nlargely entered was laughed down and disappeared; and society became\r\ndivided into camps in which no man trusted his fellow. To put an end to\r\nthis, there was neither promise to be depended upon, nor oath that\r\ncould command respect; but all parties dwelling rather in their\r\ncalculation upon the hopelessness of a permanent state of things, were\r\nmore intent upon self-defence than capable of confidence. In this\r\ncontest the blunter wits were most successful. Apprehensive of their\r\nown deficiencies and of the cleverness of their antagonists, they\r\nfeared to be worsted in debate and to be surprised by the combinations\r\nof their more versatile opponents, and so at once boldly had recourse\r\nto action: while their adversaries, arrogantly thinking that they\r\nshould know in time, and that it was unnecessary to secure by action\r\nwhat policy afforded, often fell victims to their want of precaution.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Corcyra gave the first example of most of the crimes alluded\r\nto; of the reprisals exacted by the governed who had never experienced\r\nequitable treatment or indeed aught but insolence from their\r\nrulers—when their hour came; of the iniquitous resolves of those who\r\ndesired to get rid of their accustomed poverty, and ardently coveted\r\ntheir neighbours’ goods; and lastly, of the savage and pitiless\r\nexcesses into which men who had begun the struggle, not in a class but\r\nin a party spirit, were hurried by their ungovernable passions. In the\r\nconfusion into which life was now thrown in the cities, human nature,\r\nalways rebelling against the law and now its master, gladly showed\r\nitself ungoverned in passion, above respect for justice, and the enemy\r\nof all superiority; since revenge would not have been set above\r\nreligion, and gain above justice, had it not been for the fatal power\r\nof envy. Indeed men too often take upon themselves in the prosecution\r\nof their revenge to set the example of doing away with those general\r\nlaws to which all alike can look for salvation in adversity, instead of\r\nallowing them to subsist against the day of danger when their aid may\r\nbe required.\r\n\r\nWhile the revolutionary passions thus for the first time displayed\r\nthemselves in the factions of Corcyra, Eurymedon and the Athenian fleet\r\nsailed away; after which some five hundred Corcyraean exiles who had\r\nsucceeded in escaping, took some forts on the mainland, and becoming\r\nmasters of the Corcyraean territory over the water, made this their\r\nbase to Plunder their countrymen in the island, and did so much damage\r\nas to cause a severe famine in the town. They also sent envoys to\r\nLacedaemon and Corinth to negotiate their restoration; but meeting with\r\nno success, afterwards got together boats and mercenaries and crossed\r\nover to the island, being about six hundred in all; and burning their\r\nboats so as to have no hope except in becoming masters of the country,\r\nwent up to Mount Istone, and fortifying themselves there, began to\r\nannoy those in the city and obtained command of the country.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the same summer the Athenians sent twenty ships under\r\nthe command of Laches, son of Melanopus, and Charoeades, son of\r\nEuphiletus, to Sicily, where the Syracusans and Leontines were at war.\r\nThe Syracusans had for allies all the Dorian cities except\r\nCamarina—these had been included in the Lacedaemonian confederacy from\r\nthe commencement of the war, though they had not taken any active part\r\nin it—the Leontines had Camarina and the Chalcidian cities. In Italy\r\nthe Locrians were for the Syracusans, the Rhegians for their Leontine\r\nkinsmen. The allies of the Leontines now sent to Athens and appealed to\r\ntheir ancient alliance and to their Ionian origin, to persuade the\r\nAthenians to send them a fleet, as the Syracusans were blockading them\r\nby land and sea. The Athenians sent it upon the plea of their common\r\ndescent, but in reality to prevent the exportation of Sicilian corn to\r\nPeloponnese and to test the possibility of bringing Sicily into\r\nsubjection. Accordingly they established themselves at Rhegium in\r\nItaly, and from thence carried on the war in concert with their allies.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XI\r\n\r\n\r\nYear of the War—Campaigns of Demosthenes in Western Greece—Ruin of\r\nAmbracia\r\n\r\n\r\nSummer was now over. The winter following, the plague a second time\r\nattacked the Athenians; for although it had never entirely left them,\r\nstill there had been a notable abatement in its ravages. The second\r\nvisit lasted no less than a year, the first having lasted two; and\r\nnothing distressed the Athenians and reduced their power more than\r\nthis. No less than four thousand four hundred heavy infantry in the\r\nranks died of it and three hundred cavalry, besides a number of the\r\nmultitude that was never ascertained. At the same time took place the\r\nnumerous earthquakes in Athens, Euboea, and Boeotia, particularly at\r\nOrchomenus in the last-named country.\r\n\r\nThe same winter the Athenians in Sicily and the Rhegians, with thirty\r\nships, made an expedition against the islands of Aeolus; it being\r\nimpossible to invade them in summer, owing to the want of water. These\r\nislands are occupied by the Liparaeans, a Cnidian colony, who live in\r\none of them of no great size called Lipara; and from this as their\r\nheadquarters cultivate the rest, Didyme, Strongyle, and Hiera. In Hiera\r\nthe people in those parts believe that Hephaestus has his forge, from\r\nthe quantity of flame which they see it send out by night, and of smoke\r\nby day. These islands lie off the coast of the Sicels and Messinese,\r\nand were allies of the Syracusans. The Athenians laid waste their land,\r\nand as the inhabitants did not submit, sailed back to Rhegium. Thus the\r\nwinter ended, and with it ended the fifth year of this war, of which\r\nThucydides was the historian.\r\n\r\nThe next summer the Peloponnesians and their allies set out to invade\r\nAttica under the command of Agis, son of Archidamus, and went as far as\r\nthe Isthmus, but numerous earthquakes occurring, turned back again\r\nwithout the invasion taking place. About the same time that these\r\nearthquakes were so common, the sea at Orobiae, in Euboea, retiring\r\nfrom the then line of coast, returned in a huge wave and invaded a\r\ngreat part of the town, and retreated leaving some of it still under\r\nwater; so that what was once land is now sea; such of the inhabitants\r\nperishing as could not run up to the higher ground in time. A similar\r\ninundation also occurred at Atalanta, the island off the Opuntian\r\nLocrian coast, carrying away part of the Athenian fort and wrecking one\r\nof two ships which were drawn up on the beach. At Peparethus also the\r\nsea retreated a little, without however any inundation following; and\r\nan earthquake threw down part of the wall, the town hall, and a few\r\nother buildings. The cause, in my opinion, of this phenomenon must be\r\nsought in the earthquake. At the point where its shock has been the\r\nmost violent, the sea is driven back and, suddenly recoiling with\r\nredoubled force, causes the inundation. Without an earthquake I do not\r\nsee how such an accident could happen.\r\n\r\nDuring the same summer different operations were carried on by the\r\ndifferent belligerents in Sicily; by the Siceliots themselves against\r\neach other, and by the Athenians and their allies: I shall however\r\nconfine myself to the actions in which the Athenians took part,\r\nchoosing the most important. The death of the Athenian general\r\nCharoeades, killed by the Syracusans in battle, left Laches in the sole\r\ncommand of the fleet, which he now directed in concert with the allies\r\nagainst Mylae, a place belonging to the Messinese. Two Messinese\r\nbattalions in garrison at Mylae laid an ambush for the party landing\r\nfrom the ships, but were routed with great slaughter by the Athenians\r\nand their allies, who thereupon assaulted the fortification and\r\ncompelled them to surrender the Acropolis and to march with them upon\r\nMessina. This town afterwards also submitted upon the approach of the\r\nAthenians and their allies, and gave hostages and all other securities\r\nrequired.\r\n\r\nThe same summer the Athenians sent thirty ships round Peloponnese under\r\nDemosthenes, son of Alcisthenes, and Procles, son of Theodorus, and\r\nsixty others, with two thousand heavy infantry, against Melos, under\r\nNicias, son of Niceratus; wishing to reduce the Melians, who, although\r\nislanders, refused to be subjects of Athens or even to join her\r\nconfederacy. The devastation of their land not procuring their\r\nsubmission, the fleet, weighing from Melos, sailed to Oropus in the\r\nterritory of Graea, and landing at nightfall, the heavy infantry\r\nstarted at once from the ships by land for Tanagra in Boeotia, where\r\nthey were met by the whole levy from Athens, agreeably to a concerted\r\nsignal, under the command of Hipponicus, son of Callias, and Eurymedon,\r\nson of Thucles. They encamped, and passing that day in ravaging the\r\nTanagraean territory, remained there for the night; and next day, after\r\ndefeating those of the Tanagraeans who sailed out against them and some\r\nThebans who had come up to help the Tanagraeans, took some arms, set up\r\na trophy, and retired, the troops to the city and the others to the\r\nships. Nicias with his sixty ships coasted alongshore and ravaged the\r\nLocrian seaboard, and so returned home.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the Lacedaemonians founded their colony of Heraclea in\r\nTrachis, their object being the following: the Malians form in all\r\nthree tribes, the Paralians, the Hiereans, and the Trachinians. The\r\nlast of these having suffered severely in a war with their neighbours\r\nthe Oetaeans, at first intended to give themselves up to Athens; but\r\nafterwards fearing not to find in her the security that they sought,\r\nsent to Lacedaemon, having chosen Tisamenus for their ambassador. In\r\nthis embassy joined also the Dorians from the mother country of the\r\nLacedaemonians, with the same request, as they themselves also suffered\r\nfrom the same enemy. After hearing them, the Lacedaemonians determined\r\nto send out the colony, wishing to assist the Trachinians and Dorians,\r\nand also because they thought that the proposed town would lie\r\nconveniently for the purposes of the war against the Athenians. A fleet\r\nmight be got ready there against Euboea, with the advantage of a short\r\npassage to the island; and the town would also be useful as a station\r\non the road to Thrace. In short, everything made the Lacedaemonians\r\neager to found the place. After first consulting the god at Delphi and\r\nreceiving a favourable answer, they sent off the colonists, Spartans,\r\nand Perioeci, inviting also any of the rest of the Hellenes who might\r\nwish to accompany them, except Ionians, Achaeans, and certain other\r\nnationalities; three Lacedaemonians leading as founders of the colony,\r\nLeon, Alcidas, and Damagon. The settlement effected, they fortified\r\nanew the city, now called Heraclea, distant about four miles and a half\r\nfrom Thermopylae and two miles and a quarter from the sea, and\r\ncommenced building docks, closing the side towards Thermopylae just by\r\nthe pass itself, in order that they might be easily defended.\r\n\r\nThe foundation of this town, evidently meant to annoy Euboea (the\r\npassage across to Cenaeum in that island being a short one), at first\r\ncaused some alarm at Athens, which the event however did nothing to\r\njustify, the town never giving them any trouble. The reason of this was\r\nas follows. The Thessalians, who were sovereign in those parts, and\r\nwhose territory was menaced by its foundation, were afraid that it\r\nmight prove a very powerful neighbour, and accordingly continually\r\nharassed and made war upon the new settlers, until they at last wore\r\nthem out in spite of their originally considerable numbers, people\r\nflocking from all quarters to a place founded by the Lacedaemonians,\r\nand thus thought secure of prosperity. On the other hand the\r\nLacedaemonians themselves, in the persons of their governors, did their\r\nfull share towards ruining its prosperity and reducing its population,\r\nas they frightened away the greater part of the inhabitants by\r\ngoverning harshly and in some cases not fairly, and thus made it easier\r\nfor their neighbours to prevail against them.\r\n\r\nThe same summer, about the same time that the Athenians were detained\r\nat Melos, their fellow citizens in the thirty ships cruising round\r\nPeloponnese, after cutting off some guards in an ambush at Ellomenus in\r\nLeucadia, subsequently went against Leucas itself with a large\r\narmament, having been reinforced by the whole levy of the Acarnanians\r\nexcept Oeniadae, and by the Zacynthians and Cephallenians and fifteen\r\nships from Corcyra. While the Leucadians witnessed the devastation of\r\ntheir land, without and within the isthmus upon which the town of\r\nLeucas and the temple of Apollo stand, without making any movement on\r\naccount of the overwhelming numbers of the enemy, the Acarnanians urged\r\nDemosthenes, the Athenian general, to build a wall so as to cut off the\r\ntown from the continent, a measure which they were convinced would\r\nsecure its capture and rid them once and for all of a most troublesome\r\nenemy.\r\n\r\nDemosthenes however had in the meanwhile been persuaded by the\r\nMessenians that it was a fine opportunity for him, having so large an\r\narmy assembled, to attack the Aetolians, who were not only the enemies\r\nof Naupactus, but whose reduction would further make it easy to gain\r\nthe rest of that part of the continent for the Athenians. The Aetolian\r\nnation, although numerous and warlike, yet dwelt in unwalled villages\r\nscattered far apart, and had nothing but light armour, and might,\r\naccording to the Messenians, be subdued without much difficulty before\r\nsuccours could arrive. The plan which they recommended was to attack\r\nfirst the Apodotians, next the Ophionians, and after these the\r\nEurytanians, who are the largest tribe in Aetolia, and speak, as is\r\nsaid, a language exceedingly difficult to understand, and eat their\r\nflesh raw. These once subdued, the rest would easily come in.\r\n\r\nTo this plan Demosthenes consented, not only to please the Messenians,\r\nbut also in the belief that by adding the Aetolians to his other\r\ncontinental allies he would be able, without aid from home, to march\r\nagainst the Boeotians by way of Ozolian Locris to Kytinium in Doris,\r\nkeeping Parnassus on his right until he descended to the Phocians, whom\r\nhe could force to join him if their ancient friendship for Athens did\r\nnot, as he anticipated, at once decide them to do so. Arrived in Phocis\r\nhe was already upon the frontier of Boeotia. He accordingly weighed\r\nfrom Leucas, against the wish of the Acarnanians, and with his whole\r\narmament sailed along the coast to Sollium, where he communicated to\r\nthem his intention; and upon their refusing to agree to it on account\r\nof the non-investment of Leucas, himself with the rest of the forces,\r\nthe Cephallenians, the Messenians, and Zacynthians, and three hundred\r\nAthenian marines from his own ships (the fifteen Corcyraean vessels\r\nhaving departed), started on his expedition against the Aetolians. His\r\nbase he established at Oeneon in Locris, as the Ozolian Locrians were\r\nallies of Athens and were to meet him with all their forces in the\r\ninterior. Being neighbours of the Aetolians and armed in the same way,\r\nit was thought that they would be of great service upon the expedition,\r\nfrom their acquaintance with the localities and the warfare of the\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nAfter bivouacking with the army in the precinct of Nemean Zeus, in\r\nwhich the poet Hesiod is said to have been killed by the people of the\r\ncountry, according to an oracle which had foretold that he should die\r\nin Nemea, Demosthenes set out at daybreak to invade Aetolia. The first\r\nday he took Potidania, the next Krokyle, and the third Tichium, where\r\nhe halted and sent back the booty to Eupalium in Locris, having\r\ndetermined to pursue his conquests as far as the Ophionians, and, in\r\nthe event of their refusing to submit, to return to Naupactus and make\r\nthem the objects of a second expedition. Meanwhile the Aetolians had\r\nbeen aware of his design from the moment of its formation, and as soon\r\nas the army invaded their country came up in great force with all their\r\ntribes; even the most remote Ophionians, the Bomiensians, and\r\nCalliensians, who extend towards the Malian Gulf, being among the\r\nnumber.\r\n\r\nThe Messenians, however, adhered to their original advice. Assuring\r\nDemosthenes that the Aetolians were an easy conquest, they urged him to\r\npush on as rapidly as possible, and to try to take the villages as fast\r\nas he came up to them, without waiting until the whole nation should be\r\nin arms against him. Led on by his advisers and trusting in his\r\nfortune, as he had met with no opposition, without waiting for his\r\nLocrian reinforcements, who were to have supplied him with the\r\nlight-armed darters in which he was most deficient, he advanced and\r\nstormed Aegitium, the inhabitants flying before him and posting\r\nthemselves upon the hills above the town, which stood on high ground\r\nabout nine miles from the sea. Meanwhile the Aetolians had gathered to\r\nthe rescue, and now attacked the Athenians and their allies, running\r\ndown from the hills on every side and darting their javelins, falling\r\nback when the Athenian army advanced, and coming on as it retired; and\r\nfor a long while the battle was of this character, alternate advance\r\nand retreat, in both which operations the Athenians had the worst.\r\n\r\nStill as long as their archers had arrows left and were able to use\r\nthem, they held out, the light-armed Aetolians retiring before the\r\narrows; but after the captain of the archers had been killed and his\r\nmen scattered, the soldiers, wearied out with the constant repetition\r\nof the same exertions and hard pressed by the Aetolians with their\r\njavelins, at last turned and fled, and falling into pathless gullies\r\nand places that they were unacquainted with, thus perished, the\r\nMessenian Chromon, their guide, having also unfortunately been killed.\r\nA great many were overtaken in the pursuit by the swift-footed and\r\nlight-armed Aetolians, and fell beneath their javelins; the greater\r\nnumber however missed their road and rushed into the wood, which had no\r\nways out, and which was soon fired and burnt round them by the enemy.\r\nIndeed the Athenian army fell victims to death in every form, and\r\nsuffered all the vicissitudes of flight; the survivors escaped with\r\ndifficulty to the sea and Oeneon in Locris, whence they had set out.\r\nMany of the allies were killed, and about one hundred and twenty\r\nAthenian heavy infantry, not a man less, and all in the prime of life.\r\nThese were by far the best men in the city of Athens that fell during\r\nthis war. Among the slain was also Procles, the colleague of\r\nDemosthenes. Meanwhile the Athenians took up their dead under truce\r\nfrom the Aetolians, and retired to Naupactus, and from thence went in\r\ntheir ships to Athens; Demosthenes staying behind in Naupactus and in\r\nthe neighbourhood, being afraid to face the Athenians after the\r\ndisaster.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Athenians on the coast of Sicily sailed to\r\nLocris, and in a descent which they made from the ships defeated the\r\nLocrians who came against them, and took a fort upon the river Halex.\r\n\r\nThe same summer the Aetolians, who before the Athenian expedition had\r\nsent an embassy to Corinth and Lacedaemon, composed of Tolophus, an\r\nOphionian, Boriades, an Eurytanian, and Tisander, an Apodotian,\r\nobtained that an army should be sent them against Naupactus, which had\r\ninvited the Athenian invasion. The Lacedaemonians accordingly sent off\r\ntowards autumn three thousand heavy infantry of the allies, five\r\nhundred of whom were from Heraclea, the newly founded city in Trachis,\r\nunder the command of Eurylochus, a Spartan, accompanied by Macarius and\r\nMenedaius, also Spartans.\r\n\r\nThe army having assembled at Delphi, Eurylochus sent a herald to the\r\nOzolian Locrians; the road to Naupactus lying through their territory,\r\nand he having besides conceived the idea of detaching them from Athens.\r\nHis chief abettors in Locris were the Amphissians, who were alarmed at\r\nthe hostility of the Phocians. These first gave hostages themselves,\r\nand induced the rest to do the same for fear of the invading army;\r\nfirst, their neighbours the Myonians, who held the most difficult of\r\nthe passes, and after them the Ipnians, Messapians, Tritaeans,\r\nChalaeans, Tolophonians, Hessians, and Oeanthians, all of whom joined\r\nin the expedition; the Olpaeans contenting themselves with giving\r\nhostages, without accompanying the invasion; and the Hyaeans refusing\r\nto do either, until the capture of Polis, one of their villages.\r\n\r\nHis preparations completed, Eurylochus lodged the hostages in Kytinium,\r\nin Doris, and advanced upon Naupactus through the country of the\r\nLocrians, taking upon his way Oeneon and Eupalium, two of their towns\r\nthat refused to join him. Arrived in the Naupactian territory, and\r\nhaving been now joined by the Aetolians, the army laid waste the land\r\nand took the suburb of the town, which was unfortified; and after this\r\nMolycrium also, a Corinthian colony subject to Athens. Meanwhile the\r\nAthenian Demosthenes, who since the affair in Aetolia had remained near\r\nNaupactus, having had notice of the army and fearing for the town, went\r\nand persuaded the Acarnanians, although not without difficulty because\r\nof his departure from Leucas, to go to the relief of Naupactus. They\r\naccordingly sent with him on board his ships a thousand heavy infantry,\r\nwho threw themselves into the place and saved it; the extent of its\r\nwall and the small number of its defenders otherwise placing it in the\r\ngreatest danger. Meanwhile Eurylochus and his companions, finding that\r\nthis force had entered and that it was impossible to storm the town,\r\nwithdrew, not to Peloponnese, but to the country once called Aeolis,\r\nand now Calydon and Pleuron, and to the places in that neighbourhood,\r\nand Proschium in Aetolia; the Ambraciots having come and urged them to\r\ncombine with them in attacking Amphilochian Argos and the rest of\r\nAmphilochia and Acarnania; affirming that the conquest of these\r\ncountries would bring all the continent into alliance with Lacedaemon.\r\nTo this Eurylochus consented, and dismissing the Aetolians, now\r\nremained quiet with his army in those parts, until the time should come\r\nfor the Ambraciots to take the field, and for him to join them before\r\nArgos.\r\n\r\nSummer was now over. The winter ensuing, the Athenians in Sicily with\r\ntheir Hellenic allies, and such of the Sicel subjects or allies of\r\nSyracuse as had revolted from her and joined their army, marched\r\nagainst the Sicel town Inessa, the acropolis of which was held by the\r\nSyracusans, and after attacking it without being able to take it,\r\nretired. In the retreat, the allies retreating after the Athenians were\r\nattacked by the Syracusans from the fort, and a large part of their\r\narmy routed with great slaughter. After this, Laches and the Athenians\r\nfrom the ships made some descents in Locris, and defeating the\r\nLocrians, who came against them with Proxenus, son of Capaton, upon the\r\nriver Caicinus, took some arms and departed.\r\n\r\nThe same winter the Athenians purified Delos, in compliance, it\r\nappears, with a certain oracle. It had been purified before by\r\nPisistratus the tyrant; not indeed the whole island, but as much of it\r\nas could be seen from the temple. All of it was, however, now purified\r\nin the following way. All the sepulchres of those that had died in\r\nDelos were taken up, and for the future it was commanded that no one\r\nshould be allowed either to die or to give birth to a child in the\r\nisland; but that they should be carried over to Rhenea, which is so\r\nnear to Delos that Polycrates, tyrant of Samos, having added Rhenea to\r\nhis other island conquests during his period of naval ascendancy,\r\ndedicated it to the Delian Apollo by binding it to Delos with a chain.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, after the purification, celebrated, for the first time,\r\nthe quinquennial festival of the Delian games. Once upon a time,\r\nindeed, there was a great assemblage of the Ionians and the\r\nneighbouring islanders at Delos, who used to come to the festival, as\r\nthe Ionians now do to that of Ephesus, and athletic and poetical\r\ncontests took place there, and the cities brought choirs of dancers.\r\nNothing can be clearer on this point than the following verses of\r\nHomer, taken from a hymn to Apollo:\r\n\r\nPhœbus, wherever thou strayest, far or near,\r\nDelos was still of all thy haunts most dear.\r\nThither the robed Ionians take their way\r\nWith wife and child to keep thy holiday,\r\nInvoke thy favour on each manly game,\r\nAnd dance and sing in honour of thy name.\r\n\r\n\r\nThat there was also a poetical contest in which the Ionians went to\r\ncontend, again is shown by the following, taken from the same hymn.\r\nAfter celebrating the Delian dance of the women, he ends his song of\r\npraise with these verses, in which he also alludes to himself:\r\n\r\nWell, may Apollo keep you all! and so,\r\nSweethearts, good-bye—yet tell me not I go\r\nOut from your hearts; and if in after hours\r\nSome other wanderer in this world of ours\r\nTouch at your shores, and ask your maidens here\r\nWho sings the songs the sweetest to your ear,\r\nThink of me then, and answer with a smile,\r\n‘A blind old man of Scio’s rocky isle.’\r\n\r\n\r\nHomer thus attests that there was anciently a great assembly and\r\nfestival at Delos. In later times, although the islanders and the\r\nAthenians continued to send the choirs of dancers with sacrifices, the\r\ncontests and most of the ceremonies were abolished, probably through\r\nadversity, until the Athenians celebrated the games upon this occasion\r\nwith the novelty of horse-races.\r\n\r\nThe same winter the Ambraciots, as they had promised Eurylochus when\r\nthey retained his army, marched out against Amphilochian Argos with\r\nthree thousand heavy infantry, and invading the Argive territory\r\noccupied Olpae, a stronghold on a hill near the sea, which had been\r\nformerly fortified by the Acarnanians and used as the place of assizes\r\nfor their nation, and which is about two miles and three-quarters from\r\nthe city of Argos upon the sea-coast. Meanwhile the Acarnanians went\r\nwith a part of their forces to the relief of Argos, and with the rest\r\nencamped in Amphilochia at the place called Crenae, or the Wells, to\r\nwatch for Eurylochus and his Peloponnesians, and to prevent their\r\npassing through and effecting their junction with the Ambraciots; while\r\nthey also sent for Demosthenes, the commander of the Aetolian\r\nexpedition, to be their leader, and for the twenty Athenian ships that\r\nwere cruising off Peloponnese under the command of Aristotle, son of\r\nTimocrates, and Hierophon, son of Antimnestus. On their part, the\r\nAmbraciots at Olpae sent a messenger to their own city, to beg them to\r\ncome with their whole levy to their assistance, fearing that the army\r\nof Eurylochus might not be able to pass through the Acarnanians, and\r\nthat they might themselves be obliged to fight single-handed, or be\r\nunable to retreat, if they wished it, without danger.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Eurylochus and his Peloponnesians, learning that the\r\nAmbraciots at Olpae had arrived, set out from Proschium with all haste\r\nto join them, and crossing the Achelous advanced through Acarnania,\r\nwhich they found deserted by its population, who had gone to the relief\r\nof Argos; keeping on their right the city of the Stratians and its\r\ngarrison, and on their left the rest of Acarnania. Traversing the\r\nterritory of the Stratians, they advanced through Phytia, next,\r\nskirting Medeon, through Limnaea; after which they left Acarnania\r\nbehind them and entered a friendly country, that of the Agraeans. From\r\nthence they reached and crossed Mount Thymaus, which belongs to the\r\nAgraeans, and descended into the Argive territory after nightfall, and\r\npassing between the city of Argos and the Acarnanian posts at Crenae,\r\njoined the Ambraciots at Olpae.\r\n\r\nUniting here at daybreak, they sat down at the place called Metropolis,\r\nand encamped. Not long afterwards the Athenians in the twenty ships\r\ncame into the Ambracian Gulf to support the Argives, with Demosthenes\r\nand two hundred Messenian heavy infantry, and sixty Athenian archers.\r\nWhile the fleet off Olpae blockaded the hill from the sea, the\r\nAcarnanians and a few of the Amphilochians, most of whom were kept back\r\nby force by the Ambraciots, had already arrived at Argos, and were\r\npreparing to give battle to the enemy, having chosen Demosthenes to\r\ncommand the whole of the allied army in concert with their own\r\ngenerals. Demosthenes led them near to Olpae and encamped, a great\r\nravine separating the two armies. During five days they remained\r\ninactive; on the sixth both sides formed in order of battle. The army\r\nof the Peloponnesians was the largest and outflanked their opponents;\r\nand Demosthenes fearing that his right might be surrounded, placed in\r\nambush in a hollow way overgrown with bushes some four hundred heavy\r\ninfantry and light troops, who were to rise up at the moment of the\r\nonset behind the projecting left wing of the enemy, and to take them in\r\nthe rear. When both sides were ready they joined battle; Demosthenes\r\nbeing on the right wing with the Messenians and a few Athenians, while\r\nthe rest of the line was made up of the different divisions of the\r\nAcarnanians, and of the Amphilochian carters. The Peloponnesians and\r\nAmbraciots were drawn up pell-mell together, with the exception of the\r\nMantineans, who were massed on the left, without however reaching to\r\nthe extremity of the wing, where Eurylochus and his men confronted the\r\nMessenians and Demosthenes.\r\n\r\nThe Peloponnesians were now well engaged and with their outflanking\r\nwing were upon the point of turning their enemy’s right; when the\r\nAcarnanians from the ambuscade set upon them from behind, and broke\r\nthem at the first attack, without their staying to resist; while the\r\npanic into which they fell caused the flight of most of their army,\r\nterrified beyond measure at seeing the division of Eurylochus and their\r\nbest troops cut to pieces. Most of the work was done by Demosthenes and\r\nhis Messenians, who were posted in this part of the field. Meanwhile\r\nthe Ambraciots (who are the best soldiers in those countries) and the\r\ntroops upon the right wing, defeated the division opposed to them and\r\npursued it to Argos. Returning from the pursuit, they found their main\r\nbody defeated; and hard pressed by the Acarnanians, with difficulty\r\nmade good their passage to Olpae, suffering heavy loss on the way, as\r\nthey dashed on without discipline or order, the Mantineans excepted,\r\nwho kept their ranks best of any in the army during the retreat.\r\n\r\nThe battle did not end until the evening. The next day Menedaius, who\r\non the death of Eurylochus and Macarius had succeeded to the sole\r\ncommand, being at a loss after so signal a defeat how to stay and\r\nsustain a siege, cut off as he was by land and by the Athenian fleet by\r\nsea, and equally so how to retreat in safety, opened a parley with\r\nDemosthenes and the Acarnanian generals for a truce and permission to\r\nretreat, and at the same time for the recovery of the dead. The dead\r\nthey gave back to him, and setting up a trophy took up their own also\r\nto the number of about three hundred. The retreat demanded they refused\r\npublicly to the army; but permission to depart without delay was\r\nsecretly granted to the Mantineans and to Menedaius and the other\r\ncommanders and principal men of the Peloponnesians by Demosthenes and\r\nhis Acarnanian colleagues; who desired to strip the Ambraciots and the\r\nmercenary host of foreigners of their supporters; and, above all, to\r\ndiscredit the Lacedaemonians and Peloponnesians with the Hellenes in\r\nthose parts, as traitors and self-seekers.\r\n\r\nWhile the enemy was taking up his dead and hastily burying them as he\r\ncould, and those who obtained permission were secretly planning their\r\nretreat, word was brought to Demosthenes and the Acarnanians that the\r\nAmbraciots from the city, in compliance with the first message from\r\nOlpae, were on the march with their whole levy through Amphilochia to\r\njoin their countrymen at Olpae, knowing nothing of what had occurred.\r\nDemosthenes prepared to march with his army against them, and meanwhile\r\nsent on at once a strong division to beset the roads and occupy the\r\nstrong positions. In the meantime the Mantineans and others included in\r\nthe agreement went out under the pretence of gathering herbs and\r\nfirewood, and stole off by twos and threes, picking on the way the\r\nthings which they professed to have come out for, until they had gone\r\nsome distance from Olpae, when they quickened their pace. The\r\nAmbraciots and such of the rest as had accompanied them in larger\r\nparties, seeing them going on, pushed on in their turn, and began\r\nrunning in order to catch them up. The Acarnanians at first thought\r\nthat all alike were departing without permission, and began to pursue\r\nthe Peloponnesians; and believing that they were being betrayed, even\r\nthrew a dart or two at some of their generals who tried to stop them\r\nand told them that leave had been given. Eventually, however, they let\r\npass the Mantineans and Peloponnesians, and slew only the Ambraciots,\r\nthere being much dispute and difficulty in distinguishing whether a man\r\nwas an Ambraciot or a Peloponnesian. The number thus slain was about\r\ntwo hundred; the rest escaped into the bordering territory of Agraea,\r\nand found refuge with Salynthius, the friendly king of the Agraeans.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Ambraciots from the city arrived at Idomene. Idomene\r\nconsists of two lofty hills, the higher of which the troops sent on by\r\nDemosthenes succeeded in occupying after nightfall, unobserved by the\r\nAmbraciots, who had meanwhile ascended the smaller and bivouacked under\r\nit. After supper Demosthenes set out with the rest of the army, as soon\r\nas it was evening; himself with half his force making for the pass, and\r\nthe remainder going by the Amphilochian hills. At dawn he fell upon the\r\nAmbraciots while they were still abed, ignorant of what had passed, and\r\nfully thinking that it was their own countrymen—Demosthenes having\r\npurposely put the Messenians in front with orders to address them in\r\nthe Doric dialect, and thus to inspire confidence in the sentinels, who\r\nwould not be able to see them as it was still night. In this way he\r\nrouted their army as soon as he attacked it, slaying most of them where\r\nthey were, the rest breaking away in flight over the hills. The roads,\r\nhowever, were already occupied, and while the Amphilochians knew their\r\nown country, the Ambraciots were ignorant of it and could not tell\r\nwhich way to turn, and had also heavy armour as against a light-armed\r\nenemy, and so fell into ravines and into the ambushes which had been\r\nset for them, and perished there. In their manifold efforts to escape\r\nsome even turned to the sea, which was not far off, and seeing the\r\nAthenian ships coasting alongshore just while the action was going on,\r\nswam off to them, thinking it better in the panic they were in, to\r\nperish, if perish they must, by the hands of the Athenians, than by\r\nthose of the barbarous and detested Amphilochians. Of the large\r\nAmbraciot force destroyed in this manner, a few only reached the city\r\nin safety; while the Acarnanians, after stripping the dead and setting\r\nup a trophy, returned to Argos.\r\n\r\nThe next day arrived a herald from the Ambraciots who had fled from\r\nOlpae to the Agraeans, to ask leave to take up the dead that had fallen\r\nafter the first engagement, when they left the camp with the Mantineans\r\nand their companions, without, like them, having had permission to do\r\nso. At the sight of the arms of the Ambraciots from the city, the\r\nherald was astonished at their number, knowing nothing of the disaster\r\nand fancying that they were those of their own party. Some one asked\r\nhim what he was so astonished at, and how many of them had been killed,\r\nfancying in his turn that this was the herald from the troops at\r\nIdomene. He replied: “About two hundred”; upon which his interrogator\r\ntook him up, saying: “Why, the arms you see here are of more than a\r\nthousand.” The herald replied: “Then they are not the arms of those who\r\nfought with us?” The other answered: “Yes, they are, if at least you\r\nfought at Idomene yesterday.” “But we fought with no one yesterday; but\r\nthe day before in the retreat.” “However that may be, we fought\r\nyesterday with those who came to reinforce you from the city of the\r\nAmbraciots.” When the herald heard this and knew that the reinforcement\r\nfrom the city had been destroyed, he broke into wailing and, stunned at\r\nthe magnitude of the present evils, went away at once without having\r\nperformed his errand, or again asking for the dead bodies. Indeed, this\r\nwas by far the greatest disaster that befell any one Hellenic city in\r\nan equal number of days during this war; and I have not set down the\r\nnumber of the dead, because the amount stated seems so out of\r\nproportion to the size of the city as to be incredible. In any case I\r\nknow that if the Acarnanians and Amphilochians had wished to take\r\nAmbracia as the Athenians and Demosthenes advised, they would have done\r\nso without a blow; as it was, they feared that if the Athenians had it\r\nthey would be worse neighbours to them than the present.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Acarnanians allotted a third of the spoils to the\r\nAthenians, and divided the rest among their own different towns. The\r\nshare of the Athenians was captured on the voyage home; the arms now\r\ndeposited in the Attic temples are three hundred panoplies, which the\r\nAcarnanians set apart for Demosthenes, and which he brought to Athens\r\nin person, his return to his country after the Aetolian disaster being\r\nrendered less hazardous by this exploit. The Athenians in the twenty\r\nships also went off to Naupactus. The Acarnanians and Amphilochians,\r\nafter the departure of Demosthenes and the Athenians, granted the\r\nAmbraciots and Peloponnesians who had taken refuge with Salynthius and\r\nthe Agraeans a free retreat from Oeniadae, to which place they had\r\nremoved from the country of Salynthius, and for the future concluded\r\nwith the Ambraciots a treaty and alliance for one hundred years, upon\r\nthe terms following. It was to be a defensive, not an offensive\r\nalliance; the Ambraciots could not be required to march with the\r\nAcarnanians against the Peloponnesians, nor the Acarnanians with the\r\nAmbraciots against the Athenians; for the rest the Ambraciots were to\r\ngive up the places and hostages that they held of the Amphilochians,\r\nand not to give help to Anactorium, which was at enmity with the\r\nAcarnanians. With this arrangement they put an end to the war. After\r\nthis the Corinthians sent a garrison of their own citizens to Ambracia,\r\ncomposed of three hundred heavy infantry, under the command of\r\nXenocleides, son of Euthycles, who reached their destination after a\r\ndifficult journey across the continent. Such was the history of the\r\naffair of Ambracia.\r\n\r\nThe same winter the Athenians in Sicily made a descent from their ships\r\nupon the territory of Himera, in concert with the Sicels, who had\r\ninvaded its borders from the interior, and also sailed to the islands\r\nof Aeolus. Upon their return to Rhegium they found the Athenian\r\ngeneral, Pythodorus, son of Isolochus, come to supersede Laches in the\r\ncommand of the fleet. The allies in Sicily had sailed to Athens and\r\ninduced the Athenians to send out more vessels to their assistance,\r\npointing out that the Syracusans who already commanded their land were\r\nmaking efforts to get together a navy, to avoid being any longer\r\nexcluded from the sea by a few vessels. The Athenians proceeded to man\r\nforty ships to send to them, thinking that the war in Sicily would thus\r\nbe the sooner ended, and also wishing to exercise their navy. One of\r\nthe generals, Pythodorus, was accordingly sent out with a few ships;\r\nSophocles, son of Sostratides, and Eurymedon, son of Thucles, being\r\ndestined to follow with the main body. Meanwhile Pythodorus had taken\r\nthe command of Laches’ ships, and towards the end of winter sailed\r\nagainst the Locrian fort, which Laches had formerly taken, and returned\r\nafter being defeated in battle by the Locrians.\r\n\r\nIn the first days of this spring, the stream of fire issued from Etna,\r\nas on former occasions, and destroyed some land of the Catanians, who\r\nlive upon Mount Etna, which is the largest mountain in Sicily. Fifty\r\nyears, it is said, had elapsed since the last eruption, there having\r\nbeen three in all since the Hellenes have inhabited Sicily. Such were\r\nthe events of this winter; and with it ended the sixth year of this\r\nwar, of which Thucydides was the historian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK IV\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventh Year of the War—Occupation of Pylos—Surrender of the Spartan\r\nArmy in Sphacteria\r\n\r\n\r\nNext summer, about the time of the corn’s coming into ear, ten\r\nSyracusan and as many Locrian vessels sailed to Messina, in Sicily, and\r\noccupied the town upon the invitation of the inhabitants; and Messina\r\nrevolted from the Athenians. The Syracusans contrived this chiefly\r\nbecause they saw that the place afforded an approach to Sicily, and\r\nfeared that the Athenians might hereafter use it as a base for\r\nattacking them with a larger force; the Locrians because they wished to\r\ncarry on hostilities from both sides of the strait and to reduce their\r\nenemies, the people of Rhegium. Meanwhile, the Locrians had invaded the\r\nRhegian territory with all their forces, to prevent their succouring\r\nMessina, and also at the instance of some exiles from Rhegium who were\r\nwith them; the long factions by which that town had been torn rendering\r\nit for the moment incapable of resistance, and thus furnishing an\r\nadditional temptation to the invaders. After devastating the country\r\nthe Locrian land forces retired, their ships remaining to guard\r\nMessina, while others were being manned for the same destination to\r\ncarry on the war from thence.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time in the spring, before the corn was ripe, the\r\nPeloponnesians and their allies invaded Attica under Agis, the son of\r\nArchidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians, and sat down and laid waste the\r\ncountry. Meanwhile the Athenians sent off the forty ships which they\r\nhad been preparing to Sicily, with the remaining generals Eurymedon and\r\nSophocles; their colleague Pythodorus having already preceded them\r\nthither. These had also instructions as they sailed by to look to the\r\nCorcyraeans in the town, who were being plundered by the exiles in the\r\nmountain. To support these exiles sixty Peloponnesian vessels had\r\nlately sailed, it being thought that the famine raging in the city\r\nwould make it easy for them to reduce it. Demosthenes also, who had\r\nremained without employment since his return from Acarnania, applied\r\nand obtained permission to use the fleet, if he wished it, upon the\r\ncoast of Peloponnese.\r\n\r\nOff Laconia they heard that the Peloponnesian ships were already at\r\nCorcyra, upon which Eurymedon and Sophocles wished to hasten to the\r\nisland, but Demosthenes required them first to touch at Pylos and do\r\nwhat was wanted there, before continuing their voyage. While they were\r\nmaking objections, a squall chanced to come on and carried the fleet\r\ninto Pylos. Demosthenes at once urged them to fortify the place, it\r\nbeing for this that he had come on the voyage, and made them observe\r\nthere was plenty of stone and timber on the spot, and that the place\r\nwas strong by nature, and together with much of the country round\r\nunoccupied; Pylos, or Coryphasium, as the Lacedaemonians call it, being\r\nabout forty-five miles distant from Sparta, and situated in the old\r\ncountry of the Messenians. The commanders told him that there was no\r\nlack of desert headlands in Peloponnese if he wished to put the city to\r\nexpense by occupying them. He, however, thought that this place was\r\ndistinguished from others of the kind by having a harbour close by;\r\nwhile the Messenians, the old natives of the country, speaking the same\r\ndialect as the Lacedaemonians, could do them the greatest mischief by\r\ntheir incursions from it, and would at the same time be a trusty\r\ngarrison.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking to the captains of companies on the subject, and failing\r\nto persuade either the generals or the soldiers, he remained inactive\r\nwith the rest from stress of weather; until the soldiers themselves\r\nwanting occupation were seized with a sudden impulse to go round and\r\nfortify the place. Accordingly they set to work in earnest, and having\r\nno iron tools, picked up stones, and put them together as they happened\r\nto fit, and where mortar was needed, carried it on their backs for want\r\nof hods, stooping down to make it stay on, and clasping their hands\r\ntogether behind to prevent it falling off; sparing no effort to be able\r\nto complete the most vulnerable points before the arrival of the\r\nLacedaemonians, most of the place being sufficiently strong by nature\r\nwithout further fortifications.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Lacedaemonians were celebrating a festival, and also at\r\nfirst made light of the news, in the idea that whenever they chose to\r\ntake the field the place would be immediately evacuated by the enemy or\r\neasily taken by force; the absence of their army before Athens having\r\nalso something to do with their delay. The Athenians fortified the\r\nplace on the land side, and where it most required it, in six days, and\r\nleaving Demosthenes with five ships to garrison it, with the main body\r\nof the fleet hastened on their voyage to Corcyra and Sicily.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Peloponnesians in Attica heard of the occupation of\r\nPylos, they hurried back home; the Lacedaemonians and their king Agis\r\nthinking that the matter touched them nearly. Besides having made their\r\ninvasion early in the season, and while the corn was still green, most\r\nof their troops were short of provisions: the weather also was\r\nunusually bad for the time of year, and greatly distressed their army.\r\nMany reasons thus combined to hasten their departure and to make this\r\ninvasion a very short one; indeed they only stayed fifteen days in\r\nAttica.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Athenian general Simonides getting together a\r\nfew Athenians from the garrisons, and a number of the allies in those\r\nparts, took Eion in Thrace, a Mendaean colony and hostile to Athens, by\r\ntreachery, but had no sooner done so than the Chalcidians and\r\nBottiaeans came up and beat him out of it, with the loss of many of his\r\nsoldiers.\r\n\r\nOn the return of the Peloponnesians from Attica, the Spartans\r\nthemselves and the nearest of the Perioeci at once set out for Pylos,\r\nthe other Lacedaemonians following more slowly, as they had just come\r\nin from another campaign. Word was also sent round Peloponnese to come\r\nup as quickly as possible to Pylos; while the sixty Peloponnesian ships\r\nwere sent for from Corcyra, and being dragged by their crews across the\r\nisthmus of Leucas, passed unperceived by the Athenian squadron at\r\nZacynthus, and reached Pylos, where the land forces had arrived before\r\nthem. Before the Peloponnesian fleet sailed in, Demosthenes found time\r\nto send out unobserved two ships to inform Eurymedon and the Athenians\r\non board the fleet at Zacynthus of the danger of Pylos and to summon\r\nthem to his assistance. While the ships hastened on their voyage in\r\nobedience to the orders of Demosthenes, the Lacedaemonians prepared to\r\nassault the fort by land and sea, hoping to capture with ease a work\r\nconstructed in haste, and held by a feeble garrison. Meanwhile, as they\r\nexpected the Athenian ships to arrive from Zacynthus, they intended, if\r\nthey failed to take the place before, to block up the entrances of the\r\nharbour to prevent their being able to anchor inside it. For the island\r\nof Sphacteria, stretching along in a line close in front of the\r\nharbour, at once makes it safe and narrows its entrances, leaving a\r\npassage for two ships on the side nearest Pylos and the Athenian\r\nfortifications, and for eight or nine on that next the rest of the\r\nmainland: for the rest, the island was entirely covered with wood, and\r\nwithout paths through not being inhabited, and about one mile and five\r\nfurlongs in length. The inlets the Lacedaemonians meant to close with a\r\nline of ships placed close together, with their prows turned towards\r\nthe sea, and, meanwhile, fearing that the enemy might make use of the\r\nisland to operate against them, carried over some heavy infantry\r\nthither, stationing others along the coast. By this means the island\r\nand the continent would be alike hostile to the Athenians, as they\r\nwould be unable to land on either; and the shore of Pylos itself\r\noutside the inlet towards the open sea having no harbour, and,\r\ntherefore, presenting no point which they could use as a base to\r\nrelieve their countrymen, they, the Lacedaemonians, without sea-fight\r\nor risk would in all probability become masters of the place, occupied\r\nas it had been on the spur of the moment, and unfurnished with\r\nprovisions. This being determined, they carried over to the island the\r\nheavy infantry, drafted by lot from all the companies. Some others had\r\ncrossed over before in relief parties, but these last who were left\r\nthere were four hundred and twenty in number, with their Helot\r\nattendants, commanded by Epitadas, son of Molobrus.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Demosthenes, seeing the Lacedaemonians about to attack him by\r\nsea and land at once, himself was not idle. He drew up under the\r\nfortification and enclosed in a stockade the galleys remaining to him\r\nof those which had been left him, arming the sailors taken out of them\r\nwith poor shields made most of them of osier, it being impossible to\r\nprocure arms in such a desert place, and even these having been\r\nobtained from a thirty-oared Messenian privateer and a boat belonging\r\nto some Messenians who happened to have come to them. Among these\r\nMessenians were forty heavy infantry, whom he made use of with the\r\nrest. Posting most of his men, unarmed and armed, upon the best\r\nfortified and strong points of the place towards the interior, with\r\norders to repel any attack of the land forces, he picked sixty heavy\r\ninfantry and a few archers from his whole force, and with these went\r\noutside the wall down to the sea, where he thought that the enemy would\r\nmost likely attempt to land. Although the ground was difficult and\r\nrocky, looking towards the open sea, the fact that this was the weakest\r\npart of the wall would, he thought, encourage their ardour, as the\r\nAthenians, confident in their naval superiority, had here paid little\r\nattention to their defences, and the enemy if he could force a landing\r\nmight feel secure of taking the place. At this point, accordingly,\r\ngoing down to the water’s edge, he posted his heavy infantry to\r\nprevent, if possible, a landing, and encouraged them in the following\r\nterms:\r\n\r\n“Soldiers and comrades in this adventure, I hope that none of you in\r\nour present strait will think to show his wit by exactly calculating\r\nall the perils that encompass us, but that you will rather hasten to\r\nclose with the enemy, without staying to count the odds, seeing in this\r\nyour best chance of safety. In emergencies like ours calculation is out\r\nof place; the sooner the danger is faced the better. To my mind also\r\nmost of the chances are for us, if we will only stand fast and not\r\nthrow away our advantages, overawed by the numbers of the enemy. One of\r\nthe points in our favour is the awkwardness of the landing. This,\r\nhowever, only helps us if we stand our ground. If we give way it will\r\nbe practicable enough, in spite of its natural difficulty, without a\r\ndefender; and the enemy will instantly become more formidable from the\r\ndifficulty he will have in retreating, supposing that we succeed in\r\nrepulsing him, which we shall find it easier to do, while he is on\r\nboard his ships, than after he has landed and meets us on equal terms.\r\nAs to his numbers, these need not too much alarm you. Large as they may\r\nbe he can only engage in small detachments, from the impossibility of\r\nbringing to. Besides, the numerical superiority that we have to meet is\r\nnot that of an army on land with everything else equal, but of troops\r\non board ship, upon an element where many favourable accidents are\r\nrequired to act with effect. I therefore consider that his difficulties\r\nmay be fairly set against our numerical deficiencies, and at the same\r\ntime I charge you, as Athenians who know by experience what landing\r\nfrom ships on a hostile territory means, and how impossible it is to\r\ndrive back an enemy determined enough to stand his ground and not to be\r\nfrightened away by the surf and the terrors of the ships sailing in, to\r\nstand fast in the present emergency, beat back the enemy at the water’s\r\nedge, and save yourselves and the place.”\r\n\r\nThus encouraged by Demosthenes, the Athenians felt more confident, and\r\nwent down to meet the enemy, posting themselves along the edge of the\r\nsea. The Lacedaemonians now put themselves in movement and\r\nsimultaneously assaulted the fortification with their land forces and\r\nwith their ships, forty-three in number, under their admiral,\r\nThrasymelidas, son of Cratesicles, a Spartan, who made his attack just\r\nwhere Demosthenes expected. The Athenians had thus to defend themselves\r\non both sides, from the land and from the sea; the enemy rowing up in\r\nsmall detachments, the one relieving the other—it being impossible for\r\nmany to bring to at once—and showing great ardour and cheering each\r\nother on, in the endeavour to force a passage and to take the\r\nfortification. He who most distinguished himself was Brasidas. Captain\r\nof a galley, and seeing that the captains and steersmen, impressed by\r\nthe difficulty of the position, hung back even where a landing might\r\nhave seemed possible, for fear of wrecking their vessels, he shouted\r\nout to them, that they must never allow the enemy to fortify himself in\r\ntheir country for the sake of saving timber, but must shiver their\r\nvessels and force a landing; and bade the allies, instead of hesitating\r\nin such a moment to sacrifice their ships for Lacedaemon in return for\r\nher many benefits, to run them boldly aground, land in one way or\r\nanother, and make themselves masters of the place and its garrison.\r\n\r\nNot content with this exhortation, he forced his own steersman to run\r\nhis ship ashore, and stepping on to the gangway, was endeavouring to\r\nland, when he was cut down by the Athenians, and after receiving many\r\nwounds fainted away. Falling into the bows, his shield slipped off his\r\narm into the sea, and being thrown ashore was picked up by the\r\nAthenians, and afterwards used for the trophy which they set up for\r\nthis attack. The rest also did their best, but were not able to land,\r\nowing to the difficulty of the ground and the unflinching tenacity of\r\nthe Athenians. It was a strange reversal of the order of things for\r\nAthenians to be fighting from the land, and from Laconian land too,\r\nagainst Lacedaemonians coming from the sea; while Lacedaemonians were\r\ntrying to land from shipboard in their own country, now become hostile,\r\nto attack Athenians, although the former were chiefly famous at the\r\ntime as an inland people and superior by land, the latter as a maritime\r\npeople with a navy that had no equal.\r\n\r\nAfter continuing their attacks during that day and most of the next,\r\nthe Peloponnesians desisted, and the day after sent some of their ships\r\nto Asine for timber to make engines, hoping to take by their aid, in\r\nspite of its height, the wall opposite the harbour, where the landing\r\nwas easiest. At this moment the Athenian fleet from Zacynthus arrived,\r\nnow numbering fifty sail, having been reinforced by some of the ships\r\non guard at Naupactus and by four Chian vessels. Seeing the coast and\r\nthe island both crowded with heavy infantry, and the hostile ships in\r\nharbour showing no signs of sailing out, at a loss where to anchor,\r\nthey sailed for the moment to the desert island of Prote, not far off,\r\nwhere they passed the night. The next day they got under way in\r\nreadiness to engage in the open sea if the enemy chose to put out to\r\nmeet them, being determined in the event of his not doing so to sail in\r\nand attack him. The Lacedaemonians did not put out to sea, and having\r\nomitted to close the inlets as they had intended, remained quiet on\r\nshore, engaged in manning their ships and getting ready, in the case of\r\nany one sailing in, to fight in the harbour, which is a fairly large\r\none.\r\n\r\nPerceiving this, the Athenians advanced against them by each inlet, and\r\nfalling on the enemy’s fleet, most of which was by this time afloat and\r\nin line, at once put it to flight, and giving chase as far as the short\r\ndistance allowed, disabled a good many vessels and took five, one with\r\nits crew on board; dashing in at the rest that had taken refuge on\r\nshore, and battering some that were still being manned, before they\r\ncould put out, and lashing on to their own ships and towing off empty\r\nothers whose crews had fled. At this sight the Lacedaemonians, maddened\r\nby a disaster which cut off their men on the island, rushed to the\r\nrescue, and going into the sea with their heavy armour, laid hold of\r\nthe ships and tried to drag them back, each man thinking that success\r\ndepended on his individual exertions. Great was the melee, and quite in\r\ncontradiction to the naval tactics usual to the two combatants; the\r\nLacedaemonians in their excitement and dismay being actually engaged in\r\na sea-fight on land, while the victorious Athenians, in their eagerness\r\nto push their success as far as possible, were carrying on a land-fight\r\nfrom their ships. After great exertions and numerous wounds on both\r\nsides they separated, the Lacedaemonians saving their empty ships,\r\nexcept those first taken; and both parties returning to their camp, the\r\nAthenians set up a trophy, gave back the dead, secured the wrecks, and\r\nat once began to cruise round and jealously watch the island, with its\r\nintercepted garrison, while the Peloponnesians on the mainland, whose\r\ncontingents had now all come up, stayed where they were before Pylos.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of what had happened at Pylos reached Sparta, the\r\ndisaster was thought so serious that the Lacedaemonians resolved that\r\nthe authorities should go down to the camp, and decide on the spot what\r\nwas best to be done. There, seeing that it was impossible to help their\r\nmen, and not wishing to risk their being reduced by hunger or\r\noverpowered by numbers, they determined, with the consent of the\r\nAthenian generals, to conclude an armistice at Pylos and send envoys to\r\nAthens to obtain a convention, and to endeavour to get back their men\r\nas quickly as possible.\r\n\r\nThe generals accepting their offers, an armistice was concluded upon\r\nthe terms following:\r\n\r\nThat the Lacedaemonians should bring to Pylos and deliver up to the\r\nAthenians the ships that had fought in the late engagement, and all in\r\nLaconia that were vessels of war, and should make no attack on the\r\nfortification either by land or by sea.\r\n\r\nThat the Athenians should allow the Lacedaemonians on the mainland to\r\nsend to the men in the island a certain fixed quantity of corn ready\r\nkneaded, that is to say, two quarts of barley meal, one pint of wine,\r\nand a piece of meat for each man, and half the same quantity for a\r\nservant.\r\n\r\nThat this allowance should be sent in under the eyes of the Athenians,\r\nand that no boat should sail to the island except openly.\r\n\r\nThat the Athenians should continue to the island same as before,\r\nwithout however landing upon it, and should refrain from attacking the\r\nPeloponnesian troops either by land or by sea.\r\n\r\nThat if either party should infringe any of these terms in the\r\nslightest particular, the armistice should be at once void.\r\n\r\nThat the armistice should hold good until the return of the\r\nLacedaemonian envoys from Athens—the Athenians sending them thither in\r\na galley and bringing them back again—and upon the arrival of the\r\nenvoys should be at an end, and the ships be restored by the Athenians\r\nin the same state as they received them.\r\n\r\nSuch were the terms of the armistice, and the ships were delivered over\r\nto the number of sixty, and the envoys sent off accordingly. Arrived at\r\nAthens they spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“Athenians, the Lacedaemonians sent us to try to find some way of\r\nsettling the affair of our men on the island, that shall be at once\r\nsatisfactory to our interests, and as consistent with our dignity in\r\nour misfortune as circumstances permit. We can venture to speak at some\r\nlength without any departure from the habit of our country. Men of few\r\nwords where many are not wanted, we can be less brief when there is a\r\nmatter of importance to be illustrated and an end to be served by its\r\nillustration. Meanwhile we beg you to take what we may say, not in a\r\nhostile spirit, nor as if we thought you ignorant and wished to lecture\r\nyou, but rather as a suggestion on the best course to be taken,\r\naddressed to intelligent judges. You can now, if you choose, employ\r\nyour present success to advantage, so as to keep what you have got and\r\ngain honour and reputation besides, and you can avoid the mistake of\r\nthose who meet with an extraordinary piece of good fortune, and are led\r\non by hope to grasp continually at something further, through having\r\nalready succeeded without expecting it. While those who have known most\r\nvicissitudes of good and bad, have also justly least faith in their\r\nprosperity; and to teach your city and ours this lesson experience has\r\nnot been wanting.\r\n\r\n“To be convinced of this you have only to look at our present\r\nmisfortune. What power in Hellas stood higher than we did? and yet we\r\nare come to you, although we formerly thought ourselves more able to\r\ngrant what we are now here to ask. Nevertheless, we have not been\r\nbrought to this by any decay in our power, or through having our heads\r\nturned by aggrandizement; no, our resources are what they have always\r\nbeen, and our error has been an error of judgment, to which all are\r\nequally liable. Accordingly, the prosperity which your city now enjoys,\r\nand the accession that it has lately received, must not make you fancy\r\nthat fortune will be always with you. Indeed sensible men are prudent\r\nenough to treat their gains as precarious, just as they would also keep\r\na clear head in adversity, and think that war, so far from staying\r\nwithin the limit to which a combatant may wish to confine it, will run\r\nthe course that its chances prescribe; and thus, not being puffed up by\r\nconfidence in military success, they are less likely to come to grief,\r\nand most ready to make peace, if they can, while their fortune lasts.\r\nThis, Athenians, you have a good opportunity to do now with us, and\r\nthus to escape the possible disasters which may follow upon your\r\nrefusal, and the consequent imputation of having owed to accident even\r\nyour present advantages, when you might have left behind you a\r\nreputation for power and wisdom which nothing could endanger.\r\n\r\n“The Lacedaemonians accordingly invite you to make a treaty and to end\r\nthe war, and offer peace and alliance and the most friendly and\r\nintimate relations in every way and on every occasion between us; and\r\nin return ask for the men on the island, thinking it better for both\r\nparties not to stand out to the end, on the chance of some favourable\r\naccident enabling the men to force their way out, or of their being\r\ncompelled to succumb under the pressure of blockade. Indeed if great\r\nenmities are ever to be really settled, we think it will be, not by the\r\nsystem of revenge and military success, and by forcing an opponent to\r\nswear to a treaty to his disadvantage, but when the more fortunate\r\ncombatant waives these his privileges, to be guided by gentler feelings\r\nconquers his rival in generosity, and accords peace on more moderate\r\nconditions than he expected. From that moment, instead of the debt of\r\nrevenge which violence must entail, his adversary owes a debt of\r\ngenerosity to be paid in kind, and is inclined by honour to stand to\r\nhis agreement. And men oftener act in this manner towards their\r\ngreatest enemies than where the quarrel is of less importance; they are\r\nalso by nature as glad to give way to those who first yield to them, as\r\nthey are apt to be provoked by arrogance to risks condemned by their\r\nown judgment.\r\n\r\n“To apply this to ourselves: if peace was ever desirable for both\r\nparties, it is surely so at the present moment, before anything\r\nirremediable befall us and force us to hate you eternally, personally\r\nas well as politically, and you to miss the advantages that we now\r\noffer you. While the issue is still in doubt, and you have reputation\r\nand our friendship in prospect, and we the compromise of our misfortune\r\nbefore anything fatal occur, let us be reconciled, and for ourselves\r\nchoose peace instead of war, and grant to the rest of the Hellenes a\r\nremission from their sufferings, for which be sure they will think they\r\nhave chiefly you to thank. The war that they labour under they know not\r\nwhich began, but the peace that concludes it, as it depends on your\r\ndecision, will by their gratitude be laid to your door. By such a\r\ndecision you can become firm friends with the Lacedaemonians at their\r\nown invitation, which you do not force from them, but oblige them by\r\naccepting. And from this friendship consider the advantages that are\r\nlikely to follow: when Attica and Sparta are at one, the rest of\r\nHellas, be sure, will remain in respectful inferiority before its\r\nheads.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of the Lacedaemonians, their idea being that the\r\nAthenians, already desirous of a truce and only kept back by their\r\nopposition, would joyfully accept a peace freely offered, and give back\r\nthe men. The Athenians, however, having the men on the island, thought\r\nthat the treaty would be ready for them whenever they chose to make it,\r\nand grasped at something further. Foremost to encourage them in this\r\npolicy was Cleon, son of Cleaenetus, a popular leader of the time and\r\nvery powerful with the multitude, who persuaded them to answer as\r\nfollows: First, the men in the island must surrender themselves and\r\ntheir arms and be brought to Athens. Next, the Lacedaemonians must\r\nrestore Nisaea, Pegae, Troezen, and Achaia, all places acquired not by\r\narms, but by the previous convention, under which they had been ceded\r\nby Athens herself at a moment of disaster, when a truce was more\r\nnecessary to her than at present. This done they might take back their\r\nmen, and make a truce for as long as both parties might agree.\r\n\r\nTo this answer the envoys made no reply, but asked that commissioners\r\nmight be chosen with whom they might confer on each point, and quietly\r\ntalk the matter over and try to come to some agreement. Hereupon Cleon\r\nviolently assailed them, saying that he knew from the first that they\r\nhad no right intentions, and that it was clear enough now by their\r\nrefusing to speak before the people, and wanting to confer in secret\r\nwith a committee of two or three. No, if they meant anything honest let\r\nthem say it out before all. The Lacedaemonians, however, seeing that\r\nwhatever concessions they might be prepared to make in their\r\nmisfortune, it was impossible for them to speak before the multitude\r\nand lose credit with their allies for a negotiation which might after\r\nall miscarry, and on the other hand, that the Athenians would never\r\ngrant what they asked upon moderate terms, returned from Athens without\r\nhaving effected anything.\r\n\r\nTheir arrival at once put an end to the armistice at Pylos, and the\r\nLacedaemonians asked back their ships according to the convention. The\r\nAthenians, however, alleged an attack on the fort in contravention of\r\nthe truce, and other grievances seemingly not worth mentioning, and\r\nrefused to give them back, insisting upon the clause by which the\r\nslightest infringement made the armistice void. The Lacedaemonians,\r\nafter denying the contravention and protesting against their bad faith\r\nin the matter of the ships, went away and earnestly addressed\r\nthemselves to the war. Hostilities were now carried on at Pylos upon\r\nboth sides with vigour. The Athenians cruised round the island all day\r\nwith two ships going different ways; and by night, except on the\r\nseaward side in windy weather, anchored round it with their whole\r\nfleet, which, having been reinforced by twenty ships from Athens come\r\nto aid in the blockade, now numbered seventy sail; while the\r\nPeloponnesians remained encamped on the continent, making attacks on\r\nthe fort, and on the look-out for any opportunity which might offer\r\nitself for the deliverance of their men.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Syracusans and their allies in Sicily had brought up to\r\nthe squadron guarding Messina the reinforcement which we left them\r\npreparing, and carried on the war from thence, incited chiefly by the\r\nLocrians from hatred of the Rhegians, whose territory they had invaded\r\nwith all their forces. The Syracusans also wished to try their fortune\r\nat sea, seeing that the Athenians had only a few ships actually at\r\nRhegium, and hearing that the main fleet destined to join them was\r\nengaged in blockading the island. A naval victory, they thought, would\r\nenable them to blockade Rhegium by sea and land, and easily to reduce\r\nit; a success which would at once place their affairs upon a solid\r\nbasis, the promontory of Rhegium in Italy and Messina in Sicily being\r\nso near each other that it would be impossible for the Athenians to\r\ncruise against them and command the strait. The strait in question\r\nconsists of the sea between Rhegium and Messina, at the point where\r\nSicily approaches nearest to the continent, and is the Charybdis\r\nthrough which the story makes Ulysses sail; and the narrowness of the\r\npassage and the strength of the current that pours in from the vast\r\nTyrrhenian and Sicilian mains, have rightly given it a bad reputation.\r\n\r\nIn this strait the Syracusans and their allies were compelled to fight,\r\nlate in the day, about the passage of a boat, putting out with rather\r\nmore than thirty ships against sixteen Athenian and eight Rhegian\r\nvessels. Defeated by the Athenians they hastily set off, each for\r\nhimself, to their own stations at Messina and Rhegium, with the loss of\r\none ship; night coming on before the battle was finished. After this\r\nthe Locrians retired from the Rhegian territory, and the ships of the\r\nSyracusans and their allies united and came to anchor at Cape Pelorus,\r\nin the territory of Messina, where their land forces joined them. Here\r\nthe Athenians and Rhegians sailed up, and seeing the ships unmanned,\r\nmade an attack, in which they in their turn lost one vessel, which was\r\ncaught by a grappling iron, the crew saving themselves by swimming.\r\nAfter this the Syracusans got on board their ships, and while they were\r\nbeing towed alongshore to Messina, were again attacked by the\r\nAthenians, but suddenly got out to sea and became the assailants, and\r\ncaused them to lose another vessel. After thus holding their own in the\r\nvoyage alongshore and in the engagement as above described, the\r\nSyracusans sailed on into the harbour of Messina.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians, having received warning that Camarina was\r\nabout to be betrayed to the Syracusans by Archias and his party, sailed\r\nthither; and the Messinese took this opportunity to attack by sea and\r\nland with all their forces their Chalcidian neighbour, Naxos. The first\r\nday they forced the Naxians to keep their walls, and laid waste their\r\ncountry; the next they sailed round with their ships, and laid waste\r\ntheir land on the river Akesines, while their land forces menaced the\r\ncity. Meanwhile the Sicels came down from the high country in great\r\nnumbers, to aid against the Messinese; and the Naxians, elated at the\r\nsight, and animated by a belief that the Leontines and their other\r\nHellenic allies were coming to their support, suddenly sallied out from\r\nthe town, and attacked and routed the Messinese, killing more than a\r\nthousand of them; while the remainder suffered severely in their\r\nretreat home, being attacked by the barbarians on the road, and most of\r\nthem cut off. The ships put in to Messina, and afterwards dispersed for\r\ntheir different homes. The Leontines and their allies, with the\r\nAthenians, upon this at once turned their arms against the now weakened\r\nMessina, and attacked, the Athenians with their ships on the side of\r\nthe harbour, and the land forces on that of the town. The Messinese,\r\nhowever, sallying out with Demoteles and some Locrians who had been\r\nleft to garrison the city after the disaster, suddenly attacked and\r\nrouted most of the Leontine army, killing a great number; upon seeing\r\nwhich the Athenians landed from their ships, and falling on the\r\nMessinese in disorder chased them back into the town, and setting up a\r\ntrophy retired to Rhegium. After this the Hellenes in Sicily continued\r\nto make war on each other by land, without the Athenians.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians at Pylos were still besieging the\r\nLacedaemonians in the island, the Peloponnesian forces on the continent\r\nremaining where they were. The blockade was very laborious for the\r\nAthenians from want of food and water; there was no spring except one\r\nin the citadel of Pylos itself, and that not a large one, and most of\r\nthem were obliged to grub up the shingle on the sea beach and drink\r\nsuch water as they could find. They also suffered from want of room,\r\nbeing encamped in a narrow space; and as there was no anchorage for the\r\nships, some took their meals on shore in their turn, while the others\r\nwere anchored out at sea. But their greatest discouragement arose from\r\nthe unexpectedly long time which it took to reduce a body of men shut\r\nup in a desert island, with only brackish water to drink, a matter\r\nwhich they had imagined would take them only a few days. The fact was\r\nthat the Lacedaemonians had made advertisement for volunteers to carry\r\ninto the island ground corn, wine, cheese, and any other food useful in\r\na siege; high prices being offered, and freedom promised to any of the\r\nHelots who should succeed in doing so. The Helots accordingly were most\r\nforward to engage in this risky traffic, putting off from this or that\r\npart of Peloponnese, and running in by night on the seaward side of the\r\nisland. They were best pleased, however, when they could catch a wind\r\nto carry them in. It was more easy to elude the look-out of the\r\ngalleys, when it blew from the seaward, as it became impossible for\r\nthem to anchor round the island; while the Helots had their boats rated\r\nat their value in money, and ran them ashore, without caring how they\r\nlanded, being sure to find the soldiers waiting for them at the\r\nlanding-places. But all who risked it in fair weather were taken.\r\nDivers also swam in under water from the harbour, dragging by a cord in\r\nskins poppyseed mixed with honey, and bruised linseed; these at first\r\nescaped notice, but afterwards a look-out was kept for them. In short,\r\nboth sides tried every possible contrivance, the one to throw in\r\nprovisions, and the other to prevent their introduction.\r\n\r\nAt Athens, meanwhile, the news that the army was in great distress, and\r\nthat corn found its way in to the men in the island, caused no small\r\nperplexity; and the Athenians began to fear that winter might come on\r\nand find them still engaged in the blockade. They saw that the\r\nconvoying of provisions round Peloponnese would be then impossible. The\r\ncountry offered no resources in itself, and even in summer they could\r\nnot send round enough. The blockade of a place without harbours could\r\nno longer be kept up; and the men would either escape by the siege\r\nbeing abandoned, or would watch for bad weather and sail out in the\r\nboats that brought in their corn. What caused still more alarm was the\r\nattitude of the Lacedaemonians, who must, it was thought by the\r\nAthenians, feel themselves on strong ground not to send them any more\r\nenvoys; and they began to repent having rejected the treaty. Cleon,\r\nperceiving the disfavour with which he was regarded for having stood in\r\nthe way of the convention, now said that their informants did not speak\r\nthe truth; and upon the messengers recommending them, if they did not\r\nbelieve them, to send some commissioners to see, Cleon himself and\r\nTheagenes were chosen by the Athenians as commissioners. Aware that he\r\nwould now be obliged either to say what had been already said by the\r\nmen whom he was slandering, or be proved a liar if he said the\r\ncontrary, he told the Athenians, whom he saw to be not altogether\r\ndisinclined for a fresh expedition, that instead of sending and wasting\r\ntheir time and opportunities, if they believed what was told them, they\r\nought to sail against the men. And pointing at Nicias, son of\r\nNiceratus, then general, whom he hated, he tauntingly said that it\r\nwould be easy, if they had men for generals, to sail with a force and\r\ntake those in the island, and that if he had himself been in command,\r\nhe would have done it.\r\n\r\nNicias, seeing the Athenians murmuring against Cleon for not sailing\r\nnow if it seemed to him so easy, and further seeing himself the object\r\nof attack, told him that for all that the generals cared, he might take\r\nwhat force he chose and make the attempt. At first Cleon fancied that\r\nthis resignation was merely a figure of speech, and was ready to go,\r\nbut finding that it was seriously meant, he drew back, and said that\r\nNicias, not he, was general, being now frightened, and having never\r\nsupposed that Nicias would go so far as to retire in his favour.\r\nNicias, however, repeated his offer, and resigned the command against\r\nPylos, and called the Athenians to witness that he did so. And as the\r\nmultitude is wont to do, the more Cleon shrank from the expedition and\r\ntried to back out of what he had said, the more they encouraged Nicias\r\nto hand over his command, and clamoured at Cleon to go. At last, not\r\nknowing how to get out of his words, he undertook the expedition, and\r\ncame forward and said that he was not afraid of the Lacedaemonians, but\r\nwould sail without taking any one from the city with him, except the\r\nLemnians and Imbrians that were at Athens, with some targeteers that\r\nhad come up from Aenus, and four hundred archers from other quarters.\r\nWith these and the soldiers at Pylos, he would within twenty days\r\neither bring the Lacedaemonians alive, or kill them on the spot. The\r\nAthenians could not help laughing at his fatuity, while sensible men\r\ncomforted themselves with the reflection that they must gain in either\r\ncircumstance; either they would be rid of Cleon, which they rather\r\nhoped, or if disappointed in this expectation, would reduce the\r\nLacedaemonians.\r\n\r\nAfter he had settled everything in the assembly, and the Athenians had\r\nvoted him the command of the expedition, he chose as his colleague\r\nDemosthenes, one of the generals at Pylos, and pushed forward the\r\npreparations for his voyage. His choice fell upon Demosthenes because\r\nhe heard that he was contemplating a descent on the island; the\r\nsoldiers distressed by the difficulties of the position, and rather\r\nbesieged than besiegers, being eager to fight it out, while the firing\r\nof the island had increased the confidence of the general. He had been\r\nat first afraid, because the island having never been inhabited was\r\nalmost entirely covered with wood and without paths, thinking this to\r\nbe in the enemy’s favour, as he might land with a large force, and yet\r\nmight suffer loss by an attack from an unseen position. The mistakes\r\nand forces of the enemy the wood would in a great measure conceal from\r\nhim, while every blunder of his own troops would be at once detected,\r\nand they would be thus able to fall upon him unexpectedly just where\r\nthey pleased, the attack being always in their power. If, on the other\r\nhand, he should force them to engage in the thicket, the smaller number\r\nwho knew the country would, he thought, have the advantage over the\r\nlarger who were ignorant of it, while his own army might be cut off\r\nimperceptibly, in spite of its numbers, as the men would not be able to\r\nsee where to succour each other.\r\n\r\nThe Aetolian disaster, which had been mainly caused by the wood, had\r\nnot a little to do with these reflections. Meanwhile, one of the\r\nsoldiers who were compelled by want of room to land on the extremities\r\nof the island and take their dinners, with outposts fixed to prevent a\r\nsurprise, set fire to a little of the wood without meaning to do so;\r\nand as it came on to blow soon afterwards, almost the whole was\r\nconsumed before they were aware of it. Demosthenes was now able for the\r\nfirst time to see how numerous the Lacedaemonians really were, having\r\nup to this moment been under the impression that they took in\r\nprovisions for a smaller number; he also saw that the Athenians thought\r\nsuccess important and were anxious about it, and that it was now easier\r\nto land on the island, and accordingly got ready for the attempt, sent\r\nfor troops from the allies in the neighbourhood, and pushed forward his\r\nother preparations. At this moment Cleon arrived at Pylos with the\r\ntroops which he had asked for, having sent on word to say that he was\r\ncoming. The first step taken by the two generals after their meeting\r\nwas to send a herald to the camp on the mainland, to ask if they were\r\ndisposed to avoid all risk and to order the men on the island to\r\nsurrender themselves and their arms, to be kept in gentle custody until\r\nsome general convention should be concluded.\r\n\r\nOn the rejection of this proposition the generals let one day pass, and\r\nthe next, embarking all their heavy infantry on board a few ships, put\r\nout by night, and a little before dawn landed on both sides of the\r\nisland from the open sea and from the harbour, being about eight\r\nhundred strong, and advanced with a run against the first post in the\r\nisland.\r\n\r\nThe enemy had distributed his force as follows: In this first post\r\nthere were about thirty heavy infantry; the centre and most level part,\r\nwhere the water was, was held by the main body, and by Epitadas their\r\ncommander; while a small party guarded the very end of the island,\r\ntowards Pylos, which was precipitous on the sea-side and very difficult\r\nto attack from the land, and where there was also a sort of old fort of\r\nstones rudely put together, which they thought might be useful to them,\r\nin case they should be forced to retreat. Such was their disposition.\r\n\r\nThe advanced post thus attacked by the Athenians was at once put to the\r\nsword, the men being scarcely out of bed and still arming, the landing\r\nhaving taken them by surprise, as they fancied the ships were only\r\nsailing as usual to their stations for the night. As soon as day broke,\r\nthe rest of the army landed, that is to say, all the crews of rather\r\nmore than seventy ships, except the lowest rank of oars, with the arms\r\nthey carried, eight hundred archers, and as many targeteers, the\r\nMessenian reinforcements, and all the other troops on duty round Pylos,\r\nexcept the garrison on the fort. The tactics of Demosthenes had divided\r\nthem into companies of two hundred, more or less, and made them occupy\r\nthe highest points in order to paralyse the enemy by surrounding him on\r\nevery side and thus leaving him without any tangible adversary, exposed\r\nto the cross-fire of their host; plied by those in his rear if he\r\nattacked in front, and by those on one flank if he moved against those\r\non the other. In short, wherever he went he would have the assailants\r\nbehind him, and these light-armed assailants, the most awkward of all;\r\narrows, darts, stones, and slings making them formidable at a distance,\r\nand there being no means of getting at them at close quarters, as they\r\ncould conquer flying, and the moment their pursuer turned they were\r\nupon him. Such was the idea that inspired Demosthenes in his conception\r\nof the descent, and presided over its execution.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the main body of the troops in the island (that under\r\nEpitadas), seeing their outpost cut off and an army advancing against\r\nthem, serried their ranks and pressed forward to close with the\r\nAthenian heavy infantry in front of them, the light troops being upon\r\ntheir flanks and rear. However, they were not able to engage or to\r\nprofit by their superior skill, the light troops keeping them in check\r\non either side with their missiles, and the heavy infantry remaining\r\nstationary instead of advancing to meet them; and although they routed\r\nthe light troops wherever they ran up and approached too closely, yet\r\nthey retreated fighting, being lightly equipped, and easily getting the\r\nstart in their flight, from the difficult and rugged nature of the\r\nground, in an island hitherto desert, over which the Lacedaemonians\r\ncould not pursue them with their heavy armour.\r\n\r\nAfter this skirmishing had lasted some little while, the Lacedaemonians\r\nbecame unable to dash out with the same rapidity as before upon the\r\npoints attacked, and the light troops finding that they now fought with\r\nless vigour, became more confident. They could see with their own eyes\r\nthat they were many times more numerous than the enemy; they were now\r\nmore familiar with his aspect and found him less terrible, the result\r\nnot having justified the apprehensions which they had suffered, when\r\nthey first landed in slavish dismay at the idea of attacking\r\nLacedaemonians; and accordingly their fear changing to disdain, they\r\nnow rushed all together with loud shouts upon them, and pelted them\r\nwith stones, darts, and arrows, whichever came first to hand. The\r\nshouting accompanying their onset confounded the Lacedaemonians,\r\nunaccustomed to this mode of fighting; dust rose from the newly burnt\r\nwood, and it was impossible to see in front of one with the arrows and\r\nstones flying through clouds of dust from the hands of numerous\r\nassailants. The Lacedaemonians had now to sustain a rude conflict;\r\ntheir caps would not keep out the arrows, darts had broken off in the\r\narmour of the wounded, while they themselves were helpless for offence,\r\nbeing prevented from using their eyes to see what was before them, and\r\nunable to hear the words of command for the hubbub raised by the enemy;\r\ndanger encompassed them on every side, and there was no hope of any\r\nmeans of defence or safety.\r\n\r\nAt last, after many had been already wounded in the confined space in\r\nwhich they were fighting, they formed in close order and retired on the\r\nfort at the end of the island, which was not far off, and to their\r\nfriends who held it. The moment they gave way, the light troops became\r\nbolder and pressed upon them, shouting louder than ever, and killed as\r\nmany as they came up with in their retreat, but most of the\r\nLacedaemonians made good their escape to the fort, and with the\r\ngarrison in it ranged themselves all along its whole extent to repulse\r\nthe enemy wherever it was assailable. The Athenians pursuing, unable to\r\nsurround and hem them in, owing to the strength of the ground, attacked\r\nthem in front and tried to storm the position. For a long time, indeed\r\nfor most of the day, both sides held out against all the torments of\r\nthe battle, thirst, and sun, the one endeavouring to drive the enemy\r\nfrom the high ground, the other to maintain himself upon it, it being\r\nnow more easy for the Lacedaemonians to defend themselves than before,\r\nas they could not be surrounded on the flanks.\r\n\r\nThe struggle began to seem endless, when the commander of the\r\nMessenians came to Cleon and Demosthenes, and told them that they were\r\nlosing their labour: but if they would give him some archers and light\r\ntroops to go round on the enemy’s rear by a way he would undertake to\r\nfind, he thought he could force the approach. Upon receiving what he\r\nasked for, he started from a point out of sight in order not to be seen\r\nby the enemy, and creeping on wherever the precipices of the island\r\npermitted, and where the Lacedaemonians, trusting to the strength of\r\nthe ground, kept no guard, succeeded after the greatest difficulty in\r\ngetting round without their seeing him, and suddenly appeared on the\r\nhigh ground in their rear, to the dismay of the surprised enemy and the\r\nstill greater joy of his expectant friends. The Lacedaemonians thus\r\nplaced between two fires, and in the same dilemma, to compare small\r\nthings with great, as at Thermopylae, where the defenders were cut off\r\nthrough the Persians getting round by the path, being now attacked in\r\nfront and behind, began to give way, and overcome by the odds against\r\nthem and exhausted from want of food, retreated.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians were already masters of the approaches when Cleon and\r\nDemosthenes perceiving that, if the enemy gave way a single step\r\nfurther, they would be destroyed by their soldiery, put a stop to the\r\nbattle and held their men back; wishing to take the Lacedaemonians\r\nalive to Athens, and hoping that their stubbornness might relax on\r\nhearing the offer of terms, and that they might surrender and yield to\r\nthe present overwhelming danger. Proclamation was accordingly made, to\r\nknow if they would surrender themselves and their arms to the Athenians\r\nto be dealt at their discretion.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians hearing this offer, most of them lowered their\r\nshields and waved their hands to show that they accepted it.\r\nHostilities now ceased, and a parley was held between Cleon and\r\nDemosthenes and Styphon, son of Pharax, on the other side; since\r\nEpitadas, the first of the previous commanders, had been killed, and\r\nHippagretas, the next in command, left for dead among the slain, though\r\nstill alive, and thus the command had devolved upon Styphon according\r\nto the law, in case of anything happening to his superiors. Styphon and\r\nhis companions said they wished to send a herald to the Lacedaemonians\r\non the mainland, to know what they were to do. The Athenians would not\r\nlet any of them go, but themselves called for heralds from the\r\nmainland, and after questions had been carried backwards and forwards\r\ntwo or three times, the last man that passed over from the\r\nLacedaemonians on the continent brought this message: “The\r\nLacedaemonians bid you to decide for yourselves so long as you do\r\nnothing dishonourable”; upon which after consulting together they\r\nsurrendered themselves and their arms. The Athenians, after guarding\r\nthem that day and night, the next morning set up a trophy in the\r\nisland, and got ready to sail, giving their prisoners in batches to be\r\nguarded by the captains of the galleys; and the Lacedaemonians sent a\r\nherald and took up their dead. The number of the killed and prisoners\r\ntaken in the island was as follows: four hundred and twenty heavy\r\ninfantry had passed over; three hundred all but eight were taken alive\r\nto Athens; the rest were killed. About a hundred and twenty of the\r\nprisoners were Spartans. The Athenian loss was small, the battle not\r\nhaving been fought at close quarters.\r\n\r\nThe blockade in all, counting from the fight at sea to the battle in\r\nthe island, had lasted seventy-two days. For twenty of these, during\r\nthe absence of the envoys sent to treat for peace, the men had\r\nprovisions given them, for the rest they were fed by the smugglers.\r\nCorn and other victual was found in the island; the commander Epitadas\r\nhaving kept the men upon half rations. The Athenians and Peloponnesians\r\nnow each withdrew their forces from Pylos, and went home, and crazy as\r\nCleon’s promise was, he fulfilled it, by bringing the men to Athens\r\nwithin the twenty days as he had pledged himself to do.\r\n\r\nNothing that happened in the war surprised the Hellenes so much as\r\nthis. It was the opinion that no force or famine could make the\r\nLacedaemonians give up their arms, but that they would fight on as they\r\ncould, and die with them in their hands: indeed people could scarcely\r\nbelieve that those who had surrendered were of the same stuff as the\r\nfallen; and an Athenian ally, who some time after insultingly asked one\r\nof the prisoners from the island if those that had fallen were men of\r\nhonour, received for answer that the atraktos—that is, the arrow—would\r\nbe worth a great deal if it could tell men of honour from the rest; in\r\nallusion to the fact that the killed were those whom the stones and the\r\narrows happened to hit.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of the men the Athenians determined to keep them in\r\nprison until the peace, and if the Peloponnesians invaded their country\r\nin the interval, to bring them out and put them to death. Meanwhile the\r\ndefence of Pylos was not forgotten; the Messenians from Naupactus sent\r\nto their old country, to which Pylos formerly belonged, some of the\r\nlikeliest of their number, and began a series of incursions into\r\nLaconia, which their common dialect rendered most destructive. The\r\nLacedaemonians, hitherto without experience of incursions or a warfare\r\nof the kind, finding the Helots deserting, and fearing the march of\r\nrevolution in their country, began to be seriously uneasy, and in spite\r\nof their unwillingness to betray this to the Athenians began to send\r\nenvoys to Athens, and tried to recover Pylos and the prisoners. The\r\nAthenians, however, kept grasping at more, and dismissed envoy after\r\nenvoy without their having effected anything. Such was the history of\r\nthe affair of Pylos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventh and Eighth Years of the War—End of Corcyraean Revolution— Peace\r\nof Gela—Capture of Nisaea\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same summer, directly after these events, the Athenians made an\r\nexpedition against the territory of Corinth with eighty ships and two\r\nthousand Athenian heavy infantry, and two hundred cavalry on board\r\nhorse transports, accompanied by the Milesians, Andrians, and\r\nCarystians from the allies, under the command of Nicias, son of\r\nNiceratus, with two colleagues. Putting out to sea they made land at\r\ndaybreak between Chersonese and Rheitus, at the beach of the country\r\nunderneath the Solygian hill, upon which the Dorians in old times\r\nestablished themselves and carried on war against the Aeolian\r\ninhabitants of Corinth, and where a village now stands called Solygia.\r\nThe beach where the fleet came to is about a mile and a half from the\r\nvillage, seven miles from Corinth, and two and a quarter from the\r\nIsthmus. The Corinthians had heard from Argos of the coming of the\r\nAthenian armament, and had all come up to the Isthmus long before, with\r\nthe exception of those who lived beyond it, and also of five hundred\r\nwho were away in garrison in Ambracia and Leucadia; and they were there\r\nin full force watching for the Athenians to land. These last, however,\r\ngave them the slip by coming in the dark; and being informed by signals\r\nof the fact the Corinthians left half their number at Cenchreae, in\r\ncase the Athenians should go against Crommyon, and marched in all haste\r\nto the rescue.\r\n\r\nBattus, one of the two generals present at the action, went with a\r\ncompany to defend the village of Solygia, which was unfortified;\r\nLycophron remaining to give battle with the rest. The Corinthians first\r\nattacked the right wing of the Athenians, which had just landed in\r\nfront of Chersonese, and afterwards the rest of the army. The battle\r\nwas an obstinate one, and fought throughout hand to hand. The right\r\nwing of the Athenians and Carystians, who had been placed at the end of\r\nthe line, received and with some difficulty repulsed the Corinthians,\r\nwho thereupon retreated to a wall upon the rising ground behind, and\r\nthrowing down the stones upon them, came on again singing the paean,\r\nand being received by the Athenians, were again engaged at close\r\nquarters. At this moment a Corinthian company having come to the relief\r\nof the left wing, routed and pursued the Athenian right to the sea,\r\nwhence they were in their turn driven back by the Athenians and\r\nCarystians from the ships. Meanwhile the rest of the army on either\r\nside fought on tenaciously, especially the right wing of the\r\nCorinthians, where Lycophron sustained the attack of the Athenian left,\r\nwhich it was feared might attempt the village of Solygia.\r\n\r\nAfter holding on for a long while without either giving way, the\r\nAthenians aided by their horse, of which the enemy had none, at length\r\nrouted the Corinthians, who retired to the hill and, halting, remained\r\nquiet there, without coming down again. It was in this rout of the\r\nright wing that they had the most killed, Lycophron their general being\r\namong the number. The rest of the army, broken and put to flight in\r\nthis way without being seriously pursued or hurried, retired to the\r\nhigh ground and there took up its position. The Athenians, finding that\r\nthe enemy no longer offered to engage them, stripped his dead and took\r\nup their own and immediately set up a trophy. Meanwhile, the half of\r\nthe Corinthians left at Cenchreae to guard against the Athenians\r\nsailing on Crommyon, although unable to see the battle for Mount\r\nOneion, found out what was going on by the dust, and hurried up to the\r\nrescue; as did also the older Corinthians from the town, upon\r\ndiscovering what had occurred. The Athenians seeing them all coming\r\nagainst them, and thinking that they were reinforcements arriving from\r\nthe neighbouring Peloponnesians, withdrew in haste to their ships with\r\ntheir spoils and their own dead, except two that they left behind, not\r\nbeing able to find them, and going on board crossed over to the islands\r\nopposite, and from thence sent a herald, and took up under truce the\r\nbodies which they had left behind. Two hundred and twelve Corinthians\r\nfell in the battle, and rather less than fifty Athenians.\r\n\r\nWeighing from the islands, the Athenians sailed the same day to\r\nCrommyon in the Corinthian territory, about thirteen miles from the\r\ncity, and coming to anchor laid waste the country, and passed the night\r\nthere. The next day, after first coasting along to the territory of\r\nEpidaurus and making a descent there, they came to Methana between\r\nEpidaurus and Troezen, and drew a wall across and fortified the isthmus\r\nof the peninsula, and left a post there from which incursions were\r\nhenceforth made upon the country of Troezen, Haliae, and Epidaurus.\r\nAfter walling off this spot, the fleet sailed off home.\r\n\r\nWhile these events were going on, Eurymedon and Sophocles had put to\r\nsea with the Athenian fleet from Pylos on their way to Sicily and,\r\narriving at Corcyra, joined the townsmen in an expedition against the\r\nparty established on Mount Istone, who had crossed over, as I have\r\nmentioned, after the revolution and become masters of the country, to\r\nthe great hurt of the inhabitants. Their stronghold having been taken\r\nby an attack, the garrison took refuge in a body upon some high ground\r\nand there capitulated, agreeing to give up their mercenary auxiliaries,\r\nlay down their arms, and commit themselves to the discretion of the\r\nAthenian people. The generals carried them across under truce to the\r\nisland of Ptychia, to be kept in custody until they could be sent to\r\nAthens, upon the understanding that, if any were caught running away,\r\nall would lose the benefit of the treaty. Meanwhile the leaders of the\r\nCorcyraean commons, afraid that the Athenians might spare the lives of\r\nthe prisoners, had recourse to the following stratagem. They gained\r\nover some few men on the island by secretly sending friends with\r\ninstructions to provide them with a boat, and to tell them, as if for\r\ntheir own sakes, that they had best escape as quickly as possible, as\r\nthe Athenian generals were going to give them up to the Corcyraean\r\npeople.\r\n\r\nThese representations succeeding, it was so arranged that the men were\r\ncaught sailing out in the boat that was provided, and the treaty became\r\nvoid accordingly, and the whole body were given up to the Corcyraeans.\r\nFor this result the Athenian generals were in a great measure\r\nresponsible; their evident disinclination to sail for Sicily, and thus\r\nto leave to others the honour of conducting the men to Athens,\r\nencouraged the intriguers in their design and seemed to affirm the\r\ntruth of their representations. The prisoners thus handed over were\r\nshut up by the Corcyraeans in a large building, and afterwards taken\r\nout by twenties and led past two lines of heavy infantry, one on each\r\nside, being bound together, and beaten and stabbed by the men in the\r\nlines whenever any saw pass a personal enemy; while men carrying whips\r\nwent by their side and hastened on the road those that walked too\r\nslowly.\r\n\r\nAs many as sixty men were taken out and killed in this way without the\r\nknowledge of their friends in the building, who fancied they were\r\nmerely being moved from one prison to another. At last, however,\r\nsomeone opened their eyes to the truth, upon which they called upon the\r\nAthenians to kill them themselves, if such was their pleasure, and\r\nrefused any longer to go out of the building, and said they would do\r\nall they could to prevent any one coming in. The Corcyraeans, not\r\nliking themselves to force a passage by the doors, got up on the top of\r\nthe building, and breaking through the roof, threw down the tiles and\r\nlet fly arrows at them, from which the prisoners sheltered themselves\r\nas well as they could. Most of their number, meanwhile, were engaged in\r\ndispatching themselves by thrusting into their throats the arrows shot\r\nby the enemy, and hanging themselves with the cords taken from some\r\nbeds that happened to be there, and with strips made from their\r\nclothing; adopting, in short, every possible means of self-destruction,\r\nand also falling victims to the missiles of their enemies on the roof.\r\nNight came on while these horrors were enacting, and most of it had\r\npassed before they were concluded. When it was day the Corcyraeans\r\nthrew them in layers upon wagons and carried them out of the city. All\r\nthe women taken in the stronghold were sold as slaves. In this way the\r\nCorcyraeans of the mountain were destroyed by the commons; and so after\r\nterrible excesses the party strife came to an end, at least as far as\r\nthe period of this war is concerned, for of one party there was\r\npractically nothing left. Meanwhile the Athenians sailed off to Sicily,\r\ntheir primary destination, and carried on the war with their allies\r\nthere.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the summer, the Athenians at Naupactus and the\r\nAcarnanians made an expedition against Anactorium, the Corinthian town\r\nlying at the mouth of the Ambracian Gulf, and took it by treachery; and\r\nthe Acarnanians themselves, sending settlers from all parts of\r\nAcarnania, occupied the place.\r\n\r\nSummer was now over. During the winter ensuing, Aristides, son of\r\nArchippus, one of the commanders of the Athenian ships sent to collect\r\nmoney from the allies, arrested at Eion, on the Strymon, Artaphernes, a\r\nPersian, on his way from the King to Lacedaemon. He was conducted to\r\nAthens, where the Athenians got his dispatches translated from the\r\nAssyrian character and read them. With numerous references to other\r\nsubjects, they in substance told the Lacedaemonians that the King did\r\nnot know what they wanted, as of the many ambassadors they had sent him\r\nno two ever told the same story; if however they were prepared to speak\r\nplainly they might send him some envoys with this Persian. The\r\nAthenians afterwards sent back Artaphernes in a galley to Ephesus, and\r\nambassadors with him, who heard there of the death of King Artaxerxes,\r\nson of Xerxes, which took place about that time, and so returned home.\r\n\r\nThe same winter the Chians pulled down their new wall at the command of\r\nthe Athenians, who suspected them of meditating an insurrection, after\r\nfirst however obtaining pledges from the Athenians, and security as far\r\nas this was possible for their continuing to treat them as before. Thus\r\nthe winter ended, and with it ended the seventh year of this war of\r\nwhich Thucydides is the historian.\r\n\r\nIn first days of the next summer there was an eclipse of the sun at the\r\ntime of new moon, and in the early part of the same month an\r\nearthquake. Meanwhile, the Mitylenian and other Lesbian exiles set out,\r\nfor the most part from the continent, with mercenaries hired in\r\nPeloponnese, and others levied on the spot, and took Rhoeteum, but\r\nrestored it without injury on the receipt of two thousand Phocaean\r\nstaters. After this they marched against Antandrus and took the town by\r\ntreachery, their plan being to free Antandrus and the rest of the\r\nActaean towns, formerly owned by Mitylene but now held by the\r\nAthenians. Once fortified there, they would have every facility for\r\nship-building from the vicinity of Ida and the consequent abundance of\r\ntimber, and plenty of other supplies, and might from this base easily\r\nravage Lesbos, which was not far off, and make themselves masters of\r\nthe Aeolian towns on the continent.\r\n\r\nWhile these were the schemes of the exiles, the Athenians in the same\r\nsummer made an expedition with sixty ships, two thousand heavy\r\ninfantry, a few cavalry, and some allied troops from Miletus and other\r\nparts, against Cythera, under the command of Nicias, son of Niceratus,\r\nNicostratus, son of Diotrephes, and Autocles, son of Tolmaeus. Cythera\r\nis an island lying off Laconia, opposite Malea; the inhabitants are\r\nLacedaemonians of the class of the Perioeci; and an officer called the\r\njudge of Cythera went over to the place annually from Sparta. A\r\ngarrison of heavy infantry was also regularly sent there, and great\r\nattention paid to the island, as it was the landing-place for the\r\nmerchantmen from Egypt and Libya, and at the same time secured Laconia\r\nfrom the attacks of privateers from the sea, at the only point where it\r\nis assailable, as the whole coast rises abruptly towards the Sicilian\r\nand Cretan seas.\r\n\r\nComing to land here with their armament, the Athenians with ten ships\r\nand two thousand Milesian heavy infantry took the town of Scandea, on\r\nthe sea; and with the rest of their forces landing on the side of the\r\nisland looking towards Malea, went against the lower town of Cythera,\r\nwhere they found all the inhabitants encamped. A battle ensuing, the\r\nCytherians held their ground for some little while, and then turned and\r\nfled into the upper town, where they soon afterwards capitulated to\r\nNicias and his colleagues, agreeing to leave their fate to the decision\r\nof the Athenians, their lives only being safe. A correspondence had\r\npreviously been going on between Nicias and certain of the inhabitants,\r\nwhich caused the surrender to be effected more speedily, and upon terms\r\nmore advantageous, present and future, for the Cytherians; who would\r\notherwise have been expelled by the Athenians on account of their being\r\nLacedaemonians and their island being so near to Laconia. After the\r\ncapitulation, the Athenians occupied the town of Scandea near the\r\nharbour, and appointing a garrison for Cythera, sailed to Asine, Helus,\r\nand most of the places on the sea, and making descents and passing the\r\nnight on shore at such spots as were convenient, continued ravaging the\r\ncountry for about seven days.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians seeing the Athenians masters of Cythera, and\r\nexpecting descents of the kind upon their coasts, nowhere opposed them\r\nin force, but sent garrisons here and there through the country,\r\nconsisting of as many heavy infantry as the points menaced seemed to\r\nrequire, and generally stood very much upon the defensive. After the\r\nsevere and unexpected blow that had befallen them in the island, the\r\noccupation of Pylos and Cythera, and the apparition on every side of a\r\nwar whose rapidity defied precaution, they lived in constant fear of\r\ninternal revolution, and now took the unusual step of raising four\r\nhundred horse and a force of archers, and became more timid than ever\r\nin military matters, finding themselves involved in a maritime\r\nstruggle, which their organization had never contemplated, and that\r\nagainst Athenians, with whom an enterprise unattempted was always\r\nlooked upon as a success sacrificed. Besides this, their late numerous\r\nreverses of fortune, coming close one upon another without any reason,\r\nhad thoroughly unnerved them, and they were always afraid of a second\r\ndisaster like that on the island, and thus scarcely dared to take the\r\nfield, but fancied that they could not stir without a blunder, for\r\nbeing new to the experience of adversity they had lost all confidence\r\nin themselves.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they now allowed the Athenians to ravage their seaboard,\r\nwithout making any movement, the garrisons in whose neighbourhood the\r\ndescents were made always thinking their numbers insufficient, and\r\nsharing the general feeling. A single garrison which ventured to\r\nresist, near Cotyrta and Aphrodisia, struck terror by its charge into\r\nthe scattered mob of light troops, but retreated, upon being received\r\nby the heavy infantry, with the loss of a few men and some arms, for\r\nwhich the Athenians set up a trophy, and then sailed off to Cythera.\r\nFrom thence they sailed round to Epidaurus Limera, ravaged part of the\r\ncountry, and so came to Thyrea in the Cynurian territory, upon the\r\nArgive and Laconian border. This district had been given by its\r\nLacedaemonian owners to the expelled Aeginetans to inhabit, in return\r\nfor their good offices at the time of the earthquake and the rising of\r\nthe Helots; and also because, although subjects of Athens, they had\r\nalways sided with Lacedaemon.\r\n\r\nWhile the Athenians were still at sea, the Aeginetans evacuated a fort\r\nwhich they were building upon the coast, and retreated into the upper\r\ntown where they lived, rather more than a mile from the sea. One of the\r\nLacedaemonian district garrisons which was helping them in the work,\r\nrefused to enter here with them at their entreaty, thinking it\r\ndangerous to shut themselves up within the wall, and retiring to the\r\nhigh ground remained quiet, not considering themselves a match for the\r\nenemy. Meanwhile the Athenians landed, and instantly advanced with all\r\ntheir forces and took Thyrea. The town they burnt, pillaging what was\r\nin it; the Aeginetans who were not slain in action they took with them\r\nto Athens, with Tantalus, son of Patrocles, their Lacedaemonian\r\ncommander, who had been wounded and taken prisoner. They also took with\r\nthem a few men from Cythera whom they thought it safest to remove.\r\nThese the Athenians determined to lodge in the islands: the rest of the\r\nCytherians were to retain their lands and pay four talents tribute; the\r\nAeginetans captured to be all put to death, on account of the old\r\ninveterate feud; and Tantalus to share the imprisonment of the\r\nLacedaemonians taken on the island.\r\n\r\nThe same summer, the inhabitants of Camarina and Gela in Sicily first\r\nmade an armistice with each other, after which embassies from all the\r\nother Sicilian cities assembled at Gela to try to bring about a\r\npacification. After many expressions of opinion on one side and the\r\nother, according to the griefs and pretensions of the different parties\r\ncomplaining, Hermocrates, son of Hermon, a Syracusan, the most\r\ninfluential man among them, addressed the following words to the\r\nassembly:\r\n\r\n“If I now address you, Sicilians, it is not because my city is the\r\nleast in Sicily or the greatest sufferer by the war, but in order to\r\nstate publicly what appears to me to be the best policy for the whole\r\nisland. That war is an evil is a proposition so familiar to every one\r\nthat it would be tedious to develop it. No one is forced to engage in\r\nit by ignorance, or kept out of it by fear, if he fancies there is\r\nanything to be gained by it. To the former the gain appears greater\r\nthan the danger, while the latter would rather stand the risk than put\r\nup with any immediate sacrifice. But if both should happen to have\r\nchosen the wrong moment for acting in this way, advice to make peace\r\nwould not be unserviceable; and this, if we did but see it, is just\r\nwhat we stand most in need of at the present juncture.\r\n\r\n“I suppose that no one will dispute that we went to war at first in\r\norder to serve our own several interests, that we are now, in view of\r\nthe same interests, debating how we can make peace; and that if we\r\nseparate without having as we think our rights, we shall go to war\r\nagain. And yet, as men of sense, we ought to see that our separate\r\ninterests are not alone at stake in the present congress: there is also\r\nthe question whether we have still time to save Sicily, the whole of\r\nwhich in my opinion is menaced by Athenian ambition; and we ought to\r\nfind in the name of that people more imperious arguments for peace than\r\nany which I can advance, when we see the first power in Hellas watching\r\nour mistakes with the few ships that she has at present in our waters,\r\nand under the fair name of alliance speciously seeking to turn to\r\naccount the natural hostility that exists between us. If we go to war,\r\nand call in to help us a people that are ready enough to carry their\r\narms even where they are not invited; and if we injure ourselves at our\r\nown expense, and at the same time serve as the pioneers of their\r\ndominion, we may expect, when they see us worn out, that they will one\r\nday come with a larger armament, and seek to bring all of us into\r\nsubjection.\r\n\r\n“And yet as sensible men, if we call in allies and court danger, it\r\nshould be in order to enrich our different countries with new\r\nacquisitions, and not to ruin what they possess already; and we should\r\nunderstand that the intestine discords which are so fatal to\r\ncommunities generally, will be equally so to Sicily, if we, its\r\ninhabitants, absorbed in our local quarrels, neglect the common enemy.\r\nThese considerations should reconcile individual with individual, and\r\ncity with city, and unite us in a common effort to save the whole of\r\nSicily. Nor should any one imagine that the Dorians only are enemies of\r\nAthens, while the Chalcidian race is secured by its Ionian blood; the\r\nattack in question is not inspired by hatred of one of two\r\nnationalities, but by a desire for the good things in Sicily, the\r\ncommon property of us all. This is proved by the Athenian reception of\r\nthe Chalcidian invitation: an ally who has never given them any\r\nassistance whatever, at once receives from them almost more than the\r\ntreaty entitles him to. That the Athenians should cherish this ambition\r\nand practise this policy is very excusable; and I do not blame those\r\nwho wish to rule, but those who are over-ready to serve. It is just as\r\nmuch in men’s nature to rule those who submit to them, as it is to\r\nresist those who molest them; one is not less invariable than the\r\nother. Meanwhile all who see these dangers and refuse to provide for\r\nthem properly, or who have come here without having made up their minds\r\nthat our first duty is to unite to get rid of the common peril, are\r\nmistaken. The quickest way to be rid of it is to make peace with each\r\nother; since the Athenians menace us not from their own country, but\r\nfrom that of those who invited them here. In this way instead of war\r\nissuing in war, peace quietly ends our quarrels; and the guests who\r\ncome hither under fair pretences for bad ends, will have good reason\r\nfor going away without having attained them.\r\n\r\n“So far as regards the Athenians, such are the great advantages proved\r\ninherent in a wise policy. Independently of this, in the face of the\r\nuniversal consent, that peace is the first of blessings, how can we\r\nrefuse to make it amongst ourselves; or do you not think that the good\r\nwhich you have, and the ills that you complain of, would be better\r\npreserved and cured by quiet than by war; that peace has its honours\r\nand splendours of a less perilous kind, not to mention the numerous\r\nother blessings that one might dilate on, with the not less numerous\r\nmiseries of war? These considerations should teach you not to disregard\r\nmy words, but rather to look in them every one for his own safety. If\r\nthere be any here who feels certain either by right or might to effect\r\nhis object, let not this surprise be to him too severe a\r\ndisappointment. Let him remember that many before now have tried to\r\nchastise a wrongdoer, and failing to punish their enemy have not even\r\nsaved themselves; while many who have trusted in force to gain an\r\nadvantage, instead of gaining anything more, have been doomed to lose\r\nwhat they had. Vengeance is not necessarily successful because wrong\r\nhas been done, or strength sure because it is confident; but the\r\nincalculable element in the future exercises the widest influence, and\r\nis the most treacherous, and yet in fact the most useful of all things,\r\nas it frightens us all equally, and thus makes us consider before\r\nattacking each other.\r\n\r\n“Let us therefore now allow the undefined fear of this unknown future,\r\nand the immediate terror of the Athenians’ presence, to produce their\r\nnatural impression, and let us consider any failure to carry out the\r\nprogrammes that we may each have sketched out for ourselves as\r\nsufficiently accounted for by these obstacles, and send away the\r\nintruder from the country; and if everlasting peace be impossible\r\nbetween us, let us at all events make a treaty for as long a term as\r\npossible, and put off our private differences to another day. In fine,\r\nlet us recognize that the adoption of my advice will leave us each\r\ncitizens of a free state, and as such arbiters of our own destiny, able\r\nto return good or bad offices with equal effect; while its rejection\r\nwill make us dependent on others, and thus not only impotent to repel\r\nan insult, but on the most favourable supposition, friends to our\r\ndirest enemies, and at feud with our natural friends.\r\n\r\n“For myself, though, as I said at first, the representative of a great\r\ncity, and able to think less of defending myself than of attacking\r\nothers, I am prepared to concede something in prevision of these\r\ndangers. I am not inclined to ruin myself for the sake of hurting my\r\nenemies, or so blinded by animosity as to think myself equally master\r\nof my own plans and of fortune which I cannot command; but I am ready\r\nto give up anything in reason. I call upon the rest of you to imitate\r\nmy conduct of your own free will, without being forced to do so by the\r\nenemy. There is no disgrace in connections giving way to one another, a\r\nDorian to a Dorian, or a Chalcidian to his brethren; above and beyond\r\nthis we are neighbours, live in the same country, are girt by the same\r\nsea, and go by the same name of Sicilians. We shall go to war again, I\r\nsuppose, when the time comes, and again make peace among ourselves by\r\nmeans of future congresses; but the foreign invader, if we are wise,\r\nwill always find us united against him, since the hurt of one is the\r\ndanger of all; and we shall never, in future, invite into the island\r\neither allies or mediators. By so acting we shall at the present moment\r\ndo for Sicily a double service, ridding her at once of the Athenians,\r\nand of civil war, and in future shall live in freedom at home, and be\r\nless menaced from abroad.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Hermocrates. The Sicilians took his advice, and\r\ncame to an understanding among themselves to end the war, each keeping\r\nwhat they had—the Camarinaeans taking Morgantina at a price fixed to be\r\npaid to the Syracusans—and the allies of the Athenians called the\r\nofficers in command, and told them that they were going to make peace\r\nand that they would be included in the treaty. The generals assenting,\r\nthe peace was concluded, and the Athenian fleet afterwards sailed away\r\nfrom Sicily. Upon their arrival at Athens, the Athenians banished\r\nPythodorus and Sophocles, and fined Eurymedon for having taken bribes\r\nto depart when they might have subdued Sicily. So thoroughly had the\r\npresent prosperity persuaded the citizens that nothing could withstand\r\nthem, and that they could achieve what was possible and impracticable\r\nalike, with means ample or inadequate it mattered not. The secret of\r\nthis was their general extraordinary success, which made them confuse\r\ntheir strength with their hopes.\r\n\r\nThe same summer the Megarians in the city, pressed by the hostilities\r\nof the Athenians, who invaded their country twice every year with all\r\ntheir forces, and harassed by the incursions of their own exiles at\r\nPegae, who had been expelled in a revolution by the popular party,\r\nbegan to ask each other whether it would not be better to receive back\r\ntheir exiles, and free the town from one of its two scourges. The\r\nfriends of the emigrants, perceiving the agitation, now more openly\r\nthan before demanded the adoption of this proposition; and the leaders\r\nof the commons, seeing that the sufferings of the times had tired out\r\nthe constancy of their supporters, entered in their alarm into\r\ncorrespondence with the Athenian generals, Hippocrates, son of\r\nAriphron, and Demosthenes, son of Alcisthenes, and resolved to betray\r\nthe town, thinking this less dangerous to themselves than the return of\r\nthe party which they had banished. It was accordingly arranged that the\r\nAthenians should first take the long walls extending for nearly a mile\r\nfrom the city to the port of Nisaea, to prevent the Peloponnesians\r\ncoming to the rescue from that place, where they formed the sole\r\ngarrison to secure the fidelity of Megara; and that after this the\r\nattempt should be made to put into their hands the upper town, which it\r\nwas thought would then come over with less difficulty.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, after plans had been arranged between themselves and\r\ntheir correspondents both as to words and actions, sailed by night to\r\nMinoa, the island off Megara, with six hundred heavy infantry under the\r\ncommand of Hippocrates, and took post in a quarry not far off, out of\r\nwhich bricks used to be taken for the walls; while Demosthenes, the\r\nother commander, with a detachment of Plataean light troops and another\r\nof Peripoli, placed himself in ambush in the precinct of Enyalius,\r\nwhich was still nearer. No one knew of it, except those whose business\r\nit was to know that night. A little before daybreak, the traitors in\r\nMegara began to act. Every night for a long time back, under pretence\r\nof marauding, in order to have a means of opening the gates, they had\r\nbeen used, with the consent of the officer in command, to carry by\r\nnight a sculling boat upon a cart along the ditch to the sea, and so to\r\nsail out, bringing it back again before day upon the cart, and taking\r\nit within the wall through the gates, in order, as they pretended, to\r\nbaffle the Athenian blockade at Minoa, there being no boat to be seen\r\nin the harbour. On the present occasion the cart was already at the\r\ngates, which had been opened in the usual way for the boat, when the\r\nAthenians, with whom this had been concerted, saw it, and ran at the\r\ntop of their speed from the ambush in order to reach the gates before\r\nthey were shut again, and while the cart was still there to prevent\r\ntheir being closed; their Megarian accomplices at the same moment\r\nkilling the guard at the gates. The first to run in was Demosthenes\r\nwith his Plataeans and Peripoli, just where the trophy now stands; and\r\nhe was no sooner within the gates than the Plataeans engaged and\r\ndefeated the nearest party of Peloponnesians who had taken the alarm\r\nand come to the rescue, and secured the gates for the approaching\r\nAthenian heavy infantry.\r\n\r\nAfter this, each of the Athenians as fast as they entered went against\r\nthe wall. A few of the Peloponnesian garrison stood their ground at\r\nfirst, and tried to repel the assault, and some of them were killed;\r\nbut the main body took fright and fled; the night attack and the sight\r\nof the Megarian traitors in arms against them making them think that\r\nall Megara had gone over to the enemy. It so happened also that the\r\nAthenian herald of his own idea called out and invited any of the\r\nMegarians that wished, to join the Athenian ranks; and this was no\r\nsooner heard by the garrison than they gave way, and, convinced that\r\nthey were the victims of a concerted attack, took refuge in Nisaea. By\r\ndaybreak, the walls being now taken and the Megarians in the city in\r\ngreat agitation, the persons who had negotiated with the Athenians,\r\nsupported by the rest of the popular party which was privy to the plot,\r\nsaid that they ought to open the gates and march out to battle. It had\r\nbeen concerted between them that the Athenians should rush in, the\r\nmoment that the gates were opened, while the conspirators were to be\r\ndistinguished from the rest by being anointed with oil, and so to avoid\r\nbeing hurt. They could open the gates with more security, as four\r\nthousand Athenian heavy infantry from Eleusis, and six hundred horse,\r\nhad marched all night, according to agreement, and were now close at\r\nhand. The conspirators were all ready anointed and at their posts by\r\nthe gates, when one of their accomplices denounced the plot to the\r\nopposite party, who gathered together and came in a body, and roundly\r\nsaid that they must not march out—a thing they had never yet ventured\r\non even when in greater force than at present—or wantonly compromise\r\nthe safety of the town, and that if what they said was not attended to,\r\nthe battle would have to be fought in Megara. For the rest, they gave\r\nno signs of their knowledge of the intrigue, but stoutly maintained\r\nthat their advice was the best, and meanwhile kept close by and watched\r\nthe gates, making it impossible for the conspirators to effect their\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\nThe Athenian generals seeing that some obstacle had arisen, and that\r\nthe capture of the town by force was no longer practicable, at once\r\nproceeded to invest Nisaea, thinking that, if they could take it before\r\nrelief arrived, the surrender of Megara would soon follow. Iron,\r\nstone-masons, and everything else required quickly coming up from\r\nAthens, the Athenians started from the wall which they occupied, and\r\nfrom this point built a cross wall looking towards Megara down to the\r\nsea on either side of Nisaea; the ditch and the walls being divided\r\namong the army, stones and bricks taken from the suburb, and the\r\nfruit-trees and timber cut down to make a palisade wherever this seemed\r\nnecessary; the houses also in the suburb with the addition of\r\nbattlements sometimes entering into the fortification. The whole of\r\nthis day the work continued, and by the afternoon of the next the wall\r\nwas all but completed, when the garrison in Nisaea, alarmed by the\r\nabsolute want of provisions, which they used to take in for the day\r\nfrom the upper town, not anticipating any speedy relief from the\r\nPeloponnesians, and supposing Megara to be hostile, capitulated to the\r\nAthenians on condition that they should give up their arms, and should\r\neach be ransomed for a stipulated sum; their Lacedaemonian commander,\r\nand any others of his countrymen in the place, being left to the\r\ndiscretion of the Athenians. On these conditions they surrendered and\r\ncame out, and the Athenians broke down the long walls at their point of\r\njunction with Megara, took possession of Nisaea, and went on with their\r\nother preparations.\r\n\r\nJust at this time the Lacedaemonian Brasidas, son of Tellis, happened\r\nto be in the neighbourhood of Sicyon and Corinth, getting ready an army\r\nfor Thrace. As soon as he heard of the capture of the walls, fearing\r\nfor the Peloponnesians in Nisaea and the safety of Megara, he sent to\r\nthe Boeotians to meet him as quickly as possible at Tripodiscus, a\r\nvillage so called of the Megarid, under Mount Geraneia, and went\r\nhimself, with two thousand seven hundred Corinthian heavy infantry,\r\nfour hundred Phliasians, six hundred Sicyonians, and such troops of his\r\nown as he had already levied, expecting to find Nisaea not yet taken.\r\nHearing of its fall (he had marched out by night to Tripodiscus), he\r\ntook three hundred picked men from the army, without waiting till his\r\ncoming should be known, and came up to Megara unobserved by the\r\nAthenians, who were down by the sea, ostensibly, and really if\r\npossible, to attempt Nisaea, but above all to get into Megara and\r\nsecure the town. He accordingly invited the townspeople to admit his\r\nparty, saying that he had hopes of recovering Nisaea.\r\n\r\nHowever, one of the Megarian factions feared that he might expel them\r\nand restore the exiles; the other that the commons, apprehensive of\r\nthis very danger, might set upon them, and the city be thus destroyed\r\nby a battle within its gates under the eyes of the ambushed Athenians.\r\nHe was accordingly refused admittance, both parties electing to remain\r\nquiet and await the event; each expecting a battle between the\r\nAthenians and the relieving army, and thinking it safer to see their\r\nfriends victorious before declaring in their favour.\r\n\r\nUnable to carry his point, Brasidas went back to the rest of the army.\r\nAt daybreak the Boeotians joined him. Having determined to relieve\r\nMegara, whose danger they considered their own, even before hearing\r\nfrom Brasidas, they were already in full force at Plataea, when his\r\nmessenger arrived to add spurs to their resolution; and they at once\r\nsent on to him two thousand two hundred heavy infantry, and six hundred\r\nhorse, returning home with the main body. The whole army thus assembled\r\nnumbered six thousand heavy infantry. The Athenian heavy infantry were\r\ndrawn up by Nisaea and the sea; but the light troops being scattered\r\nover the plain were attacked by the Boeotian horse and driven to the\r\nsea, being taken entirely by surprise, as on previous occasions no\r\nrelief had ever come to the Megarians from any quarter. Here the\r\nBoeotians were in their turn charged and engaged by the Athenian horse,\r\nand a cavalry action ensued which lasted a long time, and in which both\r\nparties claimed the victory. The Athenians killed and stripped the\r\nleader of the Boeotian horse and some few of his comrades who had\r\ncharged right up to Nisaea, and remaining masters of the bodies gave\r\nthem back under truce, and set up a trophy; but regarding the action as\r\na whole the forces separated without either side having gained a\r\ndecisive advantage, the Boeotians returning to their army and the\r\nAthenians to Nisaea.\r\n\r\nAfter this Brasidas and the army came nearer to the sea and to Megara,\r\nand taking up a convenient position, remained quiet in order of battle,\r\nexpecting to be attacked by the Athenians and knowing that the\r\nMegarians were waiting to see which would be the victor. This attitude\r\nseemed to present two advantages. Without taking the offensive or\r\nwillingly provoking the hazards of a battle, they openly showed their\r\nreadiness to fight, and thus without bearing the burden of the day\r\nwould fairly reap its honours; while at the same time they effectually\r\nserved their interests at Megara. For if they had failed to show\r\nthemselves they would not have had a chance, but would have certainly\r\nbeen considered vanquished, and have lost the town. As it was, the\r\nAthenians might possibly not be inclined to accept their challenge, and\r\ntheir object would be attained without fighting. And so it turned out.\r\nThe Athenians formed outside the long walls and, the enemy not\r\nattacking, there remained motionless; their generals having decided\r\nthat the risk was too unequal. In fact most of their objects had been\r\nalready attained; and they would have to begin a battle against\r\nsuperior numbers, and if victorious could only gain Megara, while a\r\ndefeat would destroy the flower of their heavy soldiery. For the enemy\r\nit was different; as even the states actually represented in his army\r\nrisked each only a part of its entire force, he might well be more\r\naudacious. Accordingly, after waiting for some time without either side\r\nattacking, the Athenians withdrew to Nisaea, and the Peloponnesians\r\nafter them to the point from which they had set out. The friends of the\r\nMegarian exiles now threw aside their hesitation, and opened the gates\r\nto Brasidas and the commanders from the different states—looking upon\r\nhim as the victor and upon the Athenians as having declined the\r\nbattle—and receiving them into the town proceeded to discuss matters\r\nwith them; the party in correspondence with the Athenians being\r\nparalysed by the turn things had taken.\r\n\r\nAfterwards Brasidas let the allies go home, and himself went back to\r\nCorinth, to prepare for his expedition to Thrace, his original\r\ndestination. The Athenians also returning home, the Megarians in the\r\ncity most implicated in the Athenian negotiation, knowing that they had\r\nbeen detected, presently disappeared; while the rest conferred with the\r\nfriends of the exiles, and restored the party at Pegae, after binding\r\nthem under solemn oaths to take no vengeance for the past, and only to\r\nconsult the real interests of the town. However, as soon as they were\r\nin office, they held a review of the heavy infantry, and separating the\r\nbattalions, picked out about a hundred of their enemies, and of those\r\nwho were thought to be most involved in the correspondence with the\r\nAthenians, brought them before the people, and compelling the vote to\r\nbe given openly, had them condemned and executed, and established a\r\nclose oligarchy in the town—a revolution which lasted a very long\r\nwhile, although effected by a very few partisans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV\r\n\r\n\r\nEighth and Ninth Years of the War—Invasion of Boeotia—Fall of\r\nAmphipolis—Brilliant Successes of Brasidas\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same summer the Mitylenians were about to fortify Antandrus, as\r\nthey had intended, when Demodocus and Aristides, the commanders of the\r\nAthenian squadron engaged in levying subsidies, heard on the Hellespont\r\nof what was being done to the place (Lamachus their colleague having\r\nsailed with ten ships into the Pontus) and conceived fears of its\r\nbecoming a second Anaia-the place in which the Samian exiles had\r\nestablished themselves to annoy Samos, helping the Peloponnesians by\r\nsending pilots to their navy, and keeping the city in agitation and\r\nreceiving all its outlaws. They accordingly got together a force from\r\nthe allies and set sail, defeated in battle the troops that met them\r\nfrom Antandrus, and retook the place. Not long after, Lamachus, who had\r\nsailed into the Pontus, lost his ships at anchor in the river Calex, in\r\nthe territory of Heraclea, rain having fallen in the interior and the\r\nflood coming suddenly down upon them; and himself and his troops passed\r\nby land through the Bithynian Thracians on the Asiatic side, and\r\narrived at Chalcedon, the Megarian colony at the mouth of the Pontus.\r\n\r\nThe same summer the Athenian general, Demosthenes, arrived at Naupactus\r\nwith forty ships immediately after the return from the Megarid.\r\nHippocrates and himself had had overtures made to them by certain men\r\nin the cities in Boeotia, who wished to change the constitution and\r\nintroduce a democracy as at Athens; Ptoeodorus, a Theban exile, being\r\nthe chief mover in this intrigue. The seaport town of Siphae, in the\r\nbay of Crisae, in the Thespian territory, was to be betrayed to them by\r\none party; Chaeronea (a dependency of what was formerly called the\r\nMinyan, now the Boeotian, Orchomenus) to be put into their hands by\r\nanother from that town, whose exiles were very active in the business,\r\nhiring men in Peloponnese. Some Phocians also were in the plot,\r\nChaeronea being the frontier town of Boeotia and close to Phanotis in\r\nPhocia. Meanwhile the Athenians were to seize Delium, the sanctuary of\r\nApollo, in the territory of Tanagra looking towards Euboea; and all\r\nthese events were to take place simultaneously upon a day appointed, in\r\norder that the Boeotians might be unable to unite to oppose them at\r\nDelium, being everywhere detained by disturbances at home. Should the\r\nenterprise succeed, and Delium be fortified, its authors confidently\r\nexpected that even if no revolution should immediately follow in\r\nBoeotia, yet with these places in their hands, and the country being\r\nharassed by incursions, and a refuge in each instance near for the\r\npartisans engaged in them, things would not remain as they were, but\r\nthat the rebels being supported by the Athenians and the forces of the\r\noligarchs divided, it would be possible after a while to settle matters\r\naccording to their wishes.\r\n\r\nSuch was the plot in contemplation. Hippocrates with a force raised at\r\nhome awaited the proper moment to take the field against the Boeotians;\r\nwhile he sent on Demosthenes with the forty ships above mentioned to\r\nNaupactus, to raise in those parts an army of Acarnanians and of the\r\nother allies, and sail and receive Siphae from the conspirators; a day\r\nhaving been agreed on for the simultaneous execution of both these\r\noperations. Demosthenes on his arrival found Oeniadae already compelled\r\nby the united Acarnanians to join the Athenian confederacy, and himself\r\nraising all the allies in those countries marched against and subdued\r\nSalynthius and the Agraeans; after which he devoted himself to the\r\npreparations necessary to enable him to be at Siphae by the time\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time in the summer, Brasidas set out on his march for\r\nthe Thracian places with seventeen hundred heavy infantry, and arriving\r\nat Heraclea in Trachis, from thence sent on a messenger to his friends\r\nat Pharsalus, to ask them to conduct himself and his army through the\r\ncountry. Accordingly there came to Melitia in Achaia Panaerus, Dorus,\r\nHippolochidas, Torylaus, and Strophacus, the Chalcidian proxenus, under\r\nwhose escort he resumed his march, being accompanied also by other\r\nThessalians, among whom was Niconidas from Larissa, a friend of\r\nPerdiccas. It was never very easy to traverse Thessaly without an\r\nescort; and throughout all Hellas for an armed force to pass without\r\nleave through a neighbour’s country was a delicate step to take.\r\nBesides this the Thessalian people had always sympathized with the\r\nAthenians. Indeed if instead of the customary close oligarchy there had\r\nbeen a constitutional government in Thessaly, he would never have been\r\nable to proceed; since even as it was, he was met on his march at the\r\nriver Enipeus by certain of the opposite party who forbade his further\r\nprogress, and complained of his making the attempt without the consent\r\nof the nation. To this his escort answered that they had no intention\r\nof taking him through against their will; they were only friends in\r\nattendance on an unexpected visitor. Brasidas himself added that he\r\ncame as a friend to Thessaly and its inhabitants, his arms not being\r\ndirected against them but against the Athenians, with whom he was at\r\nwar, and that although he knew of no quarrel between the Thessalians\r\nand Lacedaemonians to prevent the two nations having access to each\r\nother’s territory, he neither would nor could proceed against their\r\nwishes; he could only beg them not to stop him. With this answer they\r\nwent away, and he took the advice of his escort, and pushed on without\r\nhalting, before a greater force might gather to prevent him. Thus in\r\nthe day that he set out from Melitia he performed the whole distance to\r\nPharsalus, and encamped on the river Apidanus; and so to Phacium and\r\nfrom thence to Perrhaebia. Here his Thessalian escort went back, and\r\nthe Perrhaebians, who are subjects of Thessaly, set him down at Dium in\r\nthe dominions of Perdiccas, a Macedonian town under Mount Olympus,\r\nlooking towards Thessaly.\r\n\r\nIn this way Brasidas hurried through Thessaly before any one could be\r\ngot ready to stop him, and reached Perdiccas and Chalcidice. The\r\ndeparture of the army from Peloponnese had been procured by the\r\nThracian towns in revolt against Athens and by Perdiccas, alarmed at\r\nthe successes of the Athenians. The Chalcidians thought that they would\r\nbe the first objects of an Athenian expedition, not that the\r\nneighbouring towns which had not yet revolted did not also secretly\r\njoin in the invitation; and Perdiccas also had his apprehensions on\r\naccount of his old quarrels with the Athenians, although not openly at\r\nwar with them, and above all wished to reduce Arrhabaeus, king of the\r\nLyncestians. It had been less difficult for them to get an army to\r\nleave Peloponnese, because of the ill fortune of the Lacedaemonians at\r\nthe present moment. The attacks of the Athenians upon Peloponnese, and\r\nin particular upon Laconia, might, it was hoped, be diverted most\r\neffectually by annoying them in return, and by sending an army to their\r\nallies, especially as they were willing to maintain it and asked for it\r\nto aid them in revolting. The Lacedaemonians were also glad to have an\r\nexcuse for sending some of the Helots out of the country, for fear that\r\nthe present aspect of affairs and the occupation of Pylos might\r\nencourage them to move. Indeed fear of their numbers and obstinacy even\r\npersuaded the Lacedaemonians to the action which I shall now relate,\r\ntheir policy at all times having been governed by the necessity of\r\ntaking precautions against them. The Helots were invited by a\r\nproclamation to pick out those of their number who claimed to have most\r\ndistinguished themselves against the enemy, in order that they might\r\nreceive their freedom; the object being to test them, as it was thought\r\nthat the first to claim their freedom would be the most high-spirited\r\nand the most apt to rebel. As many as two thousand were selected\r\naccordingly, who crowned themselves and went round the temples,\r\nrejoicing in their new freedom. The Spartans, however, soon afterwards\r\ndid away with them, and no one ever knew how each of them perished. The\r\nSpartans now therefore gladly sent seven hundred as heavy infantry with\r\nBrasidas, who recruited the rest of his force by means of money in\r\nPeloponnese.\r\n\r\nBrasidas himself was sent out by the Lacedaemonians mainly at his own\r\ndesire, although the Chalcidians also were eager to have a man so\r\nthorough as he had shown himself whenever there was anything to be done\r\nat Sparta, and whose after-service abroad proved of the utmost use to\r\nhis country. At the present moment his just and moderate conduct\r\ntowards the towns generally succeeded in procuring their revolt,\r\nbesides the places which he managed to take by treachery; and thus when\r\nthe Lacedaemonians desired to treat, as they ultimately did, they had\r\nplaces to offer in exchange, and the burden of war meanwhile shifted\r\nfrom Peloponnese. Later on in the war, after the events in Sicily, the\r\npresent valour and conduct of Brasidas, known by experience to some, by\r\nhearsay to others, was what mainly created in the allies of Athens a\r\nfeeling for the Lacedaemonians. He was the first who went out and\r\nshowed himself so good a man at all points as to leave behind him the\r\nconviction that the rest were like him.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile his arrival in the Thracian country no sooner became known to\r\nthe Athenians than they declared war against Perdiccas, whom they\r\nregarded as the author of the expedition, and kept a closer watch on\r\ntheir allies in that quarter.\r\n\r\nUpon the arrival of Brasidas and his army, Perdiccas immediately\r\nstarted with them and with his own forces against Arrhabaeus, son of\r\nBromerus, king of the Lyncestian Macedonians, his neighbour, with whom\r\nhe had a quarrel and whom he wished to subdue. However, when he arrived\r\nwith his army and Brasidas at the pass leading into Lyncus, Brasidas\r\ntold him that before commencing hostilities he wished to go and try to\r\npersuade Arrhabaeus to become the ally of Lacedaemon, this latter\r\nhaving already made overtures intimating his willingness to make\r\nBrasidas arbitrator between them, and the Chalcidian envoys\r\naccompanying him having warned him not to remove the apprehensions of\r\nPerdiccas, in order to ensure his greater zeal in their cause. Besides,\r\nthe envoys of Perdiccas had talked at Lacedaemon about his bringing\r\nmany of the places round him into alliance with them; and thus Brasidas\r\nthought he might take a larger view of the question of Arrhabaeus.\r\nPerdiccas however retorted that he had not brought him with him to\r\narbitrate in their quarrel, but to put down the enemies whom he might\r\npoint out to him; and that while he, Perdiccas, maintained half his\r\narmy it was a breach of faith for Brasidas to parley with Arrhabaeus.\r\nNevertheless Brasidas disregarded the wishes of Perdiccas and held the\r\nparley in spite of him, and suffered himself to be persuaded to lead\r\noff the army without invading the country of Arrhabaeus; after which\r\nPerdiccas, holding that faith had not been kept with him, contributed\r\nonly a third instead of half of the support of the army.\r\n\r\nThe same summer, without loss of time, Brasidas marched with the\r\nChalcidians against Acanthus, a colony of the Andrians, a little before\r\nvintage. The inhabitants were divided into two parties on the question\r\nof receiving him; those who had joined the Chalcidians in inviting him,\r\nand the popular party. However, fear for their fruit, which was still\r\nout, enabled Brasidas to persuade the multitude to admit him alone, and\r\nto hear what he had to say before making a decision; and he was\r\nadmitted accordingly and appeared before the people, and not being a\r\nbad speaker for a Lacedaemonian, addressed them as follows:\r\n\r\n“Acanthians, the Lacedaemonians have sent out me and my army to make\r\ngood the reason that we gave for the war when we began it, viz., that\r\nwe were going to war with the Athenians in order to free Hellas. Our\r\ndelay in coming has been caused by mistaken expectations as to the war\r\nat home, which led us to hope, by our own unassisted efforts and\r\nwithout your risking anything, to effect the speedy downfall of the\r\nAthenians; and you must not blame us for this, as we are now come the\r\nmoment that we were able, prepared with your aid to do our best to\r\nsubdue them. Meanwhile I am astonished at finding your gates shut\r\nagainst me, and at not meeting with a better welcome. We Lacedaemonians\r\nthought of you as allies eager to have us, to whom we should come in\r\nspirit even before we were with you in body; and in this expectation\r\nundertook all the risks of a march of many days through a strange\r\ncountry, so far did our zeal carry us. It will be a terrible thing if\r\nafter this you have other intentions, and mean to stand in the way of\r\nyour own and Hellenic freedom. It is not merely that you oppose me\r\nyourselves; but wherever I may go people will be less inclined to join\r\nme, on the score that you, to whom I first came—an important town like\r\nAcanthus, and prudent men like the Acanthians—refused to admit me. I\r\nshall have nothing to prove that the reason which I advance is the true\r\none; it will be said either that there is something unfair in the\r\nfreedom which I offer, or that I am in insufficient force and unable to\r\nprotect you against an attack from Athens. Yet when I went with the\r\narmy which I now have to the relief of Nisaea, the Athenians did not\r\nventure to engage me although in greater force than I; and it is not\r\nlikely they will ever send across sea against you an army as numerous\r\nas they had at Nisaea. And for myself, I have come here not to hurt but\r\nto free the Hellenes, witness the solemn oaths by which I have bound my\r\ngovernment that the allies that I may bring over shall be independent;\r\nand besides my object in coming is not by force or fraud to obtain your\r\nalliance, but to offer you mine to help you against your Athenian\r\nmasters. I protest, therefore, against any suspicions of my intentions\r\nafter the guarantees which I offer, and equally so against doubts of my\r\nability to protect you, and I invite you to join me without hesitation.\r\n\r\n“Some of you may hang back because they have private enemies, and fear\r\nthat I may put the city into the hands of a party: none need be more\r\ntranquil than they. I am not come here to help this party or that; and\r\nI do not consider that I should be bringing you freedom in any real\r\nsense, if I should disregard your constitution, and enslave the many to\r\nthe few or the few to the many. This would be heavier than a foreign\r\nyoke; and we Lacedaemonians, instead of being thanked for our pains,\r\nshould get neither honour nor glory, but, contrariwise, reproaches. The\r\ncharges which strengthen our hands in the war against the Athenians\r\nwould on our own showing be merited by ourselves, and more hateful in\r\nus than in those who make no pretensions to honesty; as it is more\r\ndisgraceful for persons of character to take what they covet by\r\nfair-seeming fraud than by open force; the one aggression having for\r\nits justification the might which fortune gives, the other being simply\r\na piece of clever roguery. A matter which concerns us thus nearly we\r\nnaturally look to most jealously; and over and above the oaths that I\r\nhave mentioned, what stronger assurance can you have, when you see that\r\nour words, compared with the actual facts, produce the necessary\r\nconviction that it is our interest to act as we say?\r\n\r\n“If to these considerations of mine you put in the plea of inability,\r\nand claim that your friendly feeling should save you from being hurt by\r\nyour refusal; if you say that freedom, in your opinion, is not without\r\nits dangers, and that it is right to offer it to those who can accept\r\nit, but not to force it on any against their will, then I shall take\r\nthe gods and heroes of your country to witness that I came for your\r\ngood and was rejected, and shall do my best to compel you by laying\r\nwaste your land. I shall do so without scruple, being justified by the\r\nnecessity which constrains me, first, to prevent the Lacedaemonians\r\nfrom being damaged by you, their friends, in the event of your\r\nnonadhesion, through the moneys that you pay to the Athenians; and\r\nsecondly, to prevent the Hellenes from being hindered by you in shaking\r\noff their servitude. Otherwise indeed we should have no right to act as\r\nwe propose; except in the name of some public interest, what call\r\nshould we Lacedaemonians have to free those who do not wish it? Empire\r\nwe do not aspire to: it is what we are labouring to put down; and we\r\nshould wrong the greater number if we allowed you to stand in the way\r\nof the independence that we offer to all. Endeavour, therefore, to\r\ndecide wisely, and strive to begin the work of liberation for the\r\nHellenes, and lay up for yourselves endless renown, while you escape\r\nprivate loss, and cover your commonwealth with glory.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Brasidas. The Acanthians, after much had been\r\nsaid on both sides of the question, gave their votes in secret, and the\r\nmajority, influenced by the seductive arguments of Brasidas and by fear\r\nfor their fruit, decided to revolt from Athens; not however admitting\r\nthe army until they had taken his personal security for the oaths sworn\r\nby his government before they sent him out, assuring the independence\r\nof the allies whom he might bring over. Not long after, Stagirus, a\r\ncolony of the Andrians, followed their example and revolted.\r\n\r\nSuch were the events of this summer. It was in the first days of the\r\nwinter following that the places in Boeotia were to be put into the\r\nhands of the Athenian generals, Hippocrates and Demosthenes, the latter\r\nof whom was to go with his ships to Siphae, the former to Delium. A\r\nmistake, however, was made in the days on which they were each to\r\nstart; and Demosthenes, sailing first to Siphae, with the Acarnanians\r\nand many of the allies from those parts on board, failed to effect\r\nanything, through the plot having been betrayed by Nicomachus, a\r\nPhocian from Phanotis, who told the Lacedaemonians, and they the\r\nBoeotians. Succours accordingly flocked in from all parts of Boeotia,\r\nHippocrates not being yet there to make his diversion, and Siphae and\r\nChaeronea were promptly secured, and the conspirators, informed of the\r\nmistake, did not venture on any movement in the towns.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Hippocrates made a levy in mass of the citizens, resident\r\naliens, and foreigners in Athens, and arrived at his destination after\r\nthe Boeotians had already come back from Siphae, and encamping his army\r\nbegan to fortify Delium, the sanctuary of Apollo, in the following\r\nmanner. A trench was dug all round the temple and the consecrated\r\nground, and the earth thrown up from the excavation was made to do duty\r\nas a wall, in which stakes were also planted, the vines round the\r\nsanctuary being cut down and thrown in, together with stones and bricks\r\npulled down from the houses near; every means, in short, being used to\r\nrun up the rampart. Wooden towers were also erected where they were\r\nwanted, and where there was no part of the temple buildings left\r\nstanding, as on the side where the gallery once existing had fallen in.\r\nThe work was begun on the third day after leaving home, and continued\r\nduring the fourth, and till dinnertime on the fifth, when most of it\r\nbeing now finished the army removed from Delium about a mile and a\r\nquarter on its way home. From this point most of the light troops went\r\nstraight on, while the heavy infantry halted and remained where they\r\nwere; Hippocrates having stayed behind at Delium to arrange the posts,\r\nand to give directions for the completion of such part of the outworks\r\nas had been left unfinished.\r\n\r\nDuring the days thus employed the Boeotians were mustering at Tanagra,\r\nand by the time that they had come in from all the towns, found the\r\nAthenians already on their way home. The rest of the eleven Boeotarchs\r\nwere against giving battle, as the enemy was no longer in Boeotia, the\r\nAthenians being just over the Oropian border, when they halted; but\r\nPagondas, son of Aeolidas, one of the Boeotarchs of Thebes\r\n(Arianthides, son of Lysimachidas, being the other), and then\r\ncommander-in-chief, thought it best to hazard a battle. He accordingly\r\ncalled the men to him, company after company, to prevent their all\r\nleaving their arms at once, and urged them to attack the Athenians, and\r\nstand the issue of a battle, speaking as follows:\r\n\r\n“Boeotians, the idea that we ought not to give battle to the Athenians,\r\nunless we came up with them in Boeotia, is one which should never have\r\nentered into the head of any of us, your generals. It was to annoy\r\nBoeotia that they crossed the frontier and built a fort in our country;\r\nand they are therefore, I imagine, our enemies wherever we may come up\r\nwith them, and from wheresoever they may have come to act as enemies\r\ndo. And if any one has taken up with the idea in question for reasons\r\nof safety, it is high time for him to change his mind. The party\r\nattacked, whose own country is in danger, can scarcely discuss what is\r\nprudent with the calmness of men who are in full enjoyment of what they\r\nhave got, and are thinking of attacking a neighbour in order to get\r\nmore. It is your national habit, in your country or out of it, to\r\noppose the same resistance to a foreign invader; and when that invader\r\nis Athenian, and lives upon your frontier besides, it is doubly\r\nimperative to do so. As between neighbours generally, freedom means\r\nsimply a determination to hold one’s own; and with neighbours like\r\nthese, who are trying to enslave near and far alike, there is nothing\r\nfor it but to fight it out to the last. Look at the condition of the\r\nEuboeans and of most of the rest of Hellas, and be convinced that\r\nothers have to fight with their neighbours for this frontier or that,\r\nbut that for us conquest means one frontier for the whole country,\r\nabout which no dispute can be made, for they will simply come and take\r\nby force what we have. So much more have we to fear from this neighbour\r\nthan from another. Besides, people who, like the Athenians in the\r\npresent instance, are tempted by pride of strength to attack their\r\nneighbours, usually march most confidently against those who keep\r\nstill, and only defend themselves in their own country, but think twice\r\nbefore they grapple with those who meet them outside their frontier and\r\nstrike the first blow if opportunity offers. The Athenians have shown\r\nus this themselves; the defeat which we inflicted upon them at Coronea,\r\nat the time when our quarrels had allowed them to occupy the country,\r\nhas given great security to Boeotia until the present day. Remembering\r\nthis, the old must equal their ancient exploits, and the young, the\r\nsons of the heroes of that time, must endeavour not to disgrace their\r\nnative valour; and trusting in the help of the god whose temple has\r\nbeen sacrilegiously fortified, and in the victims which in our\r\nsacrifices have proved propitious, we must march against the enemy, and\r\nteach him that he must go and get what he wants by attacking someone\r\nwho will not resist him, but that men whose glory it is to be always\r\nready to give battle for the liberty of their own country, and never\r\nunjustly to enslave that of others, will not let him go without a\r\nstruggle.”\r\n\r\nBy these arguments Pagondas persuaded the Boeotians to attack the\r\nAthenians, and quickly breaking up his camp led his army forward, it\r\nbeing now late in the day. On nearing the enemy, he halted in a\r\nposition where a hill intervening prevented the two armies from seeing\r\neach other, and then formed and prepared for action. Meanwhile\r\nHippocrates at Delium, informed of the approach of the Boeotians, sent\r\norders to his troops to throw themselves into line, and himself joined\r\nthem not long afterwards, leaving about three hundred horse behind him\r\nat Delium, at once to guard the place in case of attack, and to watch\r\ntheir opportunity and fall upon the Boeotians during the battle. The\r\nBoeotians placed a detachment to deal with these, and when everything\r\nwas arranged to their satisfaction appeared over the hill, and halted\r\nin the order which they had determined on, to the number of seven\r\nthousand heavy infantry, more than ten thousand light troops, one\r\nthousand horse, and five hundred targeteers. On their right were the\r\nThebans and those of their province, in the centre the Haliartians,\r\nCoronaeans, Copaeans, and the other people around the lake, and on the\r\nleft the Thespians, Tanagraeans, and Orchomenians, the cavalry and the\r\nlight troops being at the extremity of each wing. The Thebans formed\r\ntwenty-five shields deep, the rest as they pleased. Such was the\r\nstrength and disposition of the Boeotian army.\r\n\r\nOn the side of the Athenians, the heavy infantry throughout the whole\r\narmy formed eight deep, being in numbers equal to the enemy, with the\r\ncavalry upon the two wings. Light troops regularly armed there were\r\nnone in the army, nor had there ever been any at Athens. Those who had\r\njoined in the invasion, though many times more numerous than those of\r\nthe enemy, had mostly followed unarmed, as part of the levy in mass of\r\nthe citizens and foreigners at Athens, and having started first on\r\ntheir way home were not present in any number. The armies being now in\r\nline and upon the point of engaging, Hippocrates, the general, passed\r\nalong the Athenian ranks, and encouraged them as follows:\r\n\r\n“Athenians, I shall only say a few words to you, but brave men require\r\nno more, and they are addressed more to your understanding than to your\r\ncourage. None of you must fancy that we are going out of our way to run\r\nthis risk in the country of another. Fought in their territory the\r\nbattle will be for ours: if we conquer, the Peloponnesians will never\r\ninvade your country without the Boeotian horse, and in one battle you\r\nwill win Boeotia and in a manner free Attica. Advance to meet them then\r\nlike citizens of a country in which you all glory as the first in\r\nHellas, and like sons of the fathers who beat them at Oenophyta with\r\nMyronides and thus gained possession of Boeotia.”\r\n\r\nHippocrates had got half through the army with his exhortation, when\r\nthe Boeotians, after a few more hasty words from Pagondas, struck up\r\nthe paean, and came against them from the hill; the Athenians advancing\r\nto meet them, and closing at a run. The extreme wing of neither army\r\ncame into action, one like the other being stopped by the water-courses\r\nin the way; the rest engaged with the utmost obstinacy, shield against\r\nshield. The Boeotian left, as far as the centre, was worsted by the\r\nAthenians. The Thespians in that part of the field suffered most\r\nseverely. The troops alongside them having given way, they were\r\nsurrounded in a narrow space and cut down fighting hand to hand; some\r\nof the Athenians also fell into confusion in surrounding the enemy and\r\nmistook and so killed each other. In this part of the field the\r\nBoeotians were beaten, and retreated upon the troops still fighting;\r\nbut the right, where the Thebans were, got the better of the Athenians\r\nand shoved them further and further back, though gradually at first. It\r\nso happened also that Pagondas, seeing the distress of his left, had\r\nsent two squadrons of horse, where they could not be seen, round the\r\nhill, and their sudden appearance struck a panic into the victorious\r\nwing of the Athenians, who thought that it was another army coming\r\nagainst them. At length in both parts of the field, disturbed by this\r\npanic, and with their line broken by the advancing Thebans, the whole\r\nAthenian army took to flight. Some made for Delium and the sea, some\r\nfor Oropus, others for Mount Parnes, or wherever they had hopes of\r\nsafety, pursued and cut down by the Boeotians, and in particular by the\r\ncavalry, composed partly of Boeotians and partly of Locrians, who had\r\ncome up just as the rout began. Night however coming on to interrupt\r\nthe pursuit, the mass of the fugitives escaped more easily than they\r\nwould otherwise have done. The next day the troops at Oropus and Delium\r\nreturned home by sea, after leaving a garrison in the latter place,\r\nwhich they continued to hold notwithstanding the defeat.\r\n\r\nThe Boeotians set up a trophy, took up their own dead, and stripped\r\nthose of the enemy, and leaving a guard over them retired to Tanagra,\r\nthere to take measures for attacking Delium. Meanwhile a herald came\r\nfrom the Athenians to ask for the dead, but was met and turned back by\r\na Boeotian herald, who told him that he would effect nothing until the\r\nreturn of himself the Boeotian herald, and who then went on to the\r\nAthenians, and told them on the part of the Boeotians that they had\r\ndone wrong in transgressing the law of the Hellenes. Of what use was\r\nthe universal custom protecting the temples in an invaded country, if\r\nthe Athenians were to fortify Delium and live there, acting exactly as\r\nif they were on unconsecrated ground, and drawing and using for their\r\npurposes the water which they, the Boeotians, never touched except for\r\nsacred uses? Accordingly for the god as well as for themselves, in the\r\nname of the deities concerned, and of Apollo, the Boeotians invited\r\nthem first to evacuate the temple, if they wished to take up the dead\r\nthat belonged to them.\r\n\r\nAfter these words from the herald, the Athenians sent their own herald\r\nto the Boeotians to say that they had not done any wrong to the temple,\r\nand for the future would do it no more harm than they could help; not\r\nhaving occupied it originally in any such design, but to defend\r\nthemselves from it against those who were really wronging them. The law\r\nof the Hellenes was that conquest of a country, whether more or less\r\nextensive, carried with it possession of the temples in that country,\r\nwith the obligation to keep up the usual ceremonies, at least as far as\r\npossible. The Boeotians and most other people who had turned out the\r\nowners of a country, and put themselves in their places by force, now\r\nheld as of right the temples which they originally entered as usurpers.\r\nIf the Athenians could have conquered more of Boeotia this would have\r\nbeen the case with them: as things stood, the piece of it which they\r\nhad got they should treat as their own, and not quit unless obliged.\r\nThe water they had disturbed under the impulsion of a necessity which\r\nthey had not wantonly incurred, having been forced to use it in\r\ndefending themselves against the Boeotians who first invaded Attica.\r\nBesides, anything done under the pressure of war and danger might\r\nreasonably claim indulgence even in the eye of the god; or why, pray,\r\nwere the altars the asylum for involuntary offences? Transgression also\r\nwas a term applied to presumptuous offenders, not to the victims of\r\nadverse circumstances. In short, which were most impious—the Boeotians\r\nwho wished to barter dead bodies for holy places, or the Athenians who\r\nrefused to give up holy places to obtain what was theirs by right? The\r\ncondition of evacuating Boeotia must therefore be withdrawn. They were\r\nno longer in Boeotia. They stood where they stood by the right of the\r\nsword. All that the Boeotians had to do was to tell them to take up\r\ntheir dead under a truce according to the national custom.\r\n\r\nThe Boeotians replied that if they were in Boeotia, they must evacuate\r\nthat country before taking up their dead; if they were in their own\r\nterritory, they could do as they pleased: for they knew that, although\r\nthe Oropid where the bodies as it chanced were lying (the battle having\r\nbeen fought on the borders) was subject to Athens, yet the Athenians\r\ncould not get them without their leave. Besides, why should they grant\r\na truce for Athenian ground? And what could be fairer than to tell them\r\nto evacuate Boeotia if they wished to get what they asked? The Athenian\r\nherald accordingly returned with this answer, without having\r\naccomplished his object.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Boeotians at once sent for darters and slingers from the\r\nMalian Gulf, and with two thousand Corinthian heavy infantry who had\r\njoined them after the battle, the Peloponnesian garrison which had\r\nevacuated Nisaea, and some Megarians with them, marched against Delium,\r\nand attacked the fort, and after divers efforts finally succeeded in\r\ntaking it by an engine of the following description. They sawed in two\r\nand scooped out a great beam from end to end, and fitting it nicely\r\ntogether again like a pipe, hung by chains a cauldron at one extremity,\r\nwith which communicated an iron tube projecting from the beam, which\r\nwas itself in great part plated with iron. This they brought up from a\r\ndistance upon carts to the part of the wall principally composed of\r\nvines and timber, and when it was near, inserted huge bellows into\r\ntheir end of the beam and blew with them. The blast passing closely\r\nconfined into the cauldron, which was filled with lighted coals,\r\nsulphur and pitch, made a great blaze, and set fire to the wall, which\r\nsoon became untenable for its defenders, who left it and fled; and in\r\nthis way the fort was taken. Of the garrison some were killed and two\r\nhundred made prisoners; most of the rest got on board their ships and\r\nreturned home.\r\n\r\nSoon after the fall of Delium, which took place seventeen days after\r\nthe battle, the Athenian herald, without knowing what had happened,\r\ncame again for the dead, which were now restored by the Boeotians, who\r\nno longer answered as at first. Not quite five hundred Boeotians fell\r\nin the battle, and nearly one thousand Athenians, including Hippocrates\r\nthe general, besides a great number of light troops and camp followers.\r\n\r\nSoon after this battle Demosthenes, after the failure of his voyage to\r\nSiphae and of the plot on the town, availed himself of the Acarnanian\r\nand Agraean troops and of the four hundred Athenian heavy infantry\r\nwhich he had on board, to make a descent on the Sicyonian coast. Before\r\nhowever all his ships had come to shore, the Sicyonians came up and\r\nrouted and chased to their ships those that had landed, killing some\r\nand taking others prisoners; after which they set up a trophy, and gave\r\nback the dead under truce.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time with the affair of Delium took place the death of\r\nSitalces, king of the Odrysians, who was defeated in battle, in a\r\ncampaign against the Triballi; Seuthes, son of Sparadocus, his nephew,\r\nsucceeding to the kingdom of the Odrysians, and of the rest of Thrace\r\nruled by Sitalces.\r\n\r\nThe same winter Brasidas, with his allies in the Thracian places,\r\nmarched against Amphipolis, the Athenian colony on the river Strymon. A\r\nsettlement upon the spot on which the city now stands was before\r\nattempted by Aristagoras, the Milesian (when he fled from King Darius),\r\nwho was however dislodged by the Edonians; and thirty-two years later\r\nby the Athenians, who sent thither ten thousand settlers of their own\r\ncitizens, and whoever else chose to go. These were cut off at Drabescus\r\nby the Thracians. Twenty-nine years after, the Athenians returned\r\n(Hagnon, son of Nicias, being sent out as leader of the colony) and\r\ndrove out the Edonians, and founded a town on the spot, formerly called\r\nEnnea Hodoi or Nine Ways. The base from which they started was Eion,\r\ntheir commercial seaport at the mouth of the river, not more than three\r\nmiles from the present town, which Hagnon named Amphipolis, because the\r\nStrymon flows round it on two sides, and he built it so as to be\r\nconspicuous from the sea and land alike, running a long wall across\r\nfrom river to river, to complete the circumference.\r\n\r\nBrasidas now marched against this town, starting from Arne in\r\nChalcidice. Arriving about dusk at Aulon and Bromiscus, where the lake\r\nof Bolbe runs into the sea, he supped there, and went on during the\r\nnight. The weather was stormy and it was snowing a little, which\r\nencouraged him to hurry on, in order, if possible, to take every one at\r\nAmphipolis by surprise, except the party who were to betray it. The\r\nplot was carried on by some natives of Argilus, an Andrian colony,\r\nresiding in Amphipolis, where they had also other accomplices gained\r\nover by Perdiccas or the Chalcidians. But the most active in the matter\r\nwere the inhabitants of Argilus itself, which is close by, who had\r\nalways been suspected by the Athenians, and had had designs on the\r\nplace. These men now saw their opportunity arrive with Brasidas, and\r\nhaving for some time been in correspondence with their countrymen in\r\nAmphipolis for the betrayal of the town, at once received him into\r\nArgilus, and revolted from the Athenians, and that same night took him\r\non to the bridge over the river; where he found only a small guard to\r\noppose him, the town being at some distance from the passage, and the\r\nwalls not reaching down to it as at present. This guard he easily drove\r\nin, partly through there being treason in their ranks, partly from the\r\nstormy state of the weather and the suddenness of his attack, and so\r\ngot across the bridge, and immediately became master of all the\r\nproperty outside; the Amphipolitans having houses all over the quarter.\r\n\r\nThe passage of Brasidas was a complete surprise to the people in the\r\ntown; and the capture of many of those outside, and the flight of the\r\nrest within the wall, combined to produce great confusion among the\r\ncitizens; especially as they did not trust one another. It is even said\r\nthat if Brasidas, instead of stopping to pillage, had advanced straight\r\nagainst the town, he would probably have taken it. In fact, however, he\r\nestablished himself where he was and overran the country outside, and\r\nfor the present remained inactive, vainly awaiting a demonstration on\r\nthe part of his friends within. Meanwhile the party opposed to the\r\ntraitors proved numerous enough to prevent the gates being immediately\r\nthrown open, and in concert with Eucles, the general, who had come from\r\nAthens to defend the place, sent to the other commander in Thrace,\r\nThucydides, son of Olorus, the author of this history, who was at the\r\nisle of Thasos, a Parian colony, half a day’s sail from Amphipolis, to\r\ntell him to come to their relief. On receipt of this message he at once\r\nset sail with seven ships which he had with him, in order, if possible,\r\nto reach Amphipolis in time to prevent its capitulation, or in any case\r\nto save Eion.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Brasidas, afraid of succours arriving by sea from Thasos, and\r\nlearning that Thucydides possessed the right of working the gold mines\r\nin that part of Thrace, and had thus great influence with the\r\ninhabitants of the continent, hastened to gain the town, if possible,\r\nbefore the people of Amphipolis should be encouraged by his arrival to\r\nhope that he could save them by getting together a force of allies from\r\nthe sea and from Thrace, and so refuse to surrender. He accordingly\r\noffered moderate terms, proclaiming that any of the Amphipolitans and\r\nAthenians who chose, might continue to enjoy their property with full\r\nrights of citizenship; while those who did not wish to stay had five\r\ndays to depart, taking their property with them.\r\n\r\nThe bulk of the inhabitants, upon hearing this, began to change their\r\nminds, especially as only a small number of the citizens were\r\nAthenians, the majority having come from different quarters, and many\r\nof the prisoners outside had relations within the walls. They found the\r\nproclamation a fair one in comparison of what their fear had suggested;\r\nthe Athenians being glad to go out, as they thought they ran more risk\r\nthan the rest, and further, did not expect any speedy relief, and the\r\nmultitude generally being content at being left in possession of their\r\ncivic rights, and at such an unexpected reprieve from danger. The\r\npartisans of Brasidas now openly advocated this course, seeing that the\r\nfeeling of the people had changed, and that they no longer gave ear to\r\nthe Athenian general present; and thus the surrender was made and\r\nBrasidas was admitted by them on the terms of his proclamation. In this\r\nway they gave up the city, and late in the same day Thucydides and his\r\nships entered the harbour of Eion, Brasidas having just got hold of\r\nAmphipolis, and having been within a night of taking Eion: had the\r\nships been less prompt in relieving it, in the morning it would have\r\nbeen his.\r\n\r\nAfter this Thucydides put all in order at Eion to secure it against any\r\npresent or future attack of Brasidas, and received such as had elected\r\nto come there from the interior according to the terms agreed on.\r\nMeanwhile Brasidas suddenly sailed with a number of boats down the\r\nriver to Eion to see if he could not seize the point running out from\r\nthe wall, and so command the entrance; at the same time he attempted it\r\nby land, but was beaten off on both sides and had to content himself\r\nwith arranging matters at Amphipolis and in the neighbourhood.\r\nMyrcinus, an Edonian town, also came over to him; the Edonian king\r\nPittacus having been killed by the sons of Goaxis and his own wife\r\nBrauro; and Galepsus and Oesime, which are Thasian colonies, not long\r\nafter followed its example. Perdiccas too came up immediately after the\r\ncapture and joined in these arrangements.\r\n\r\nThe news that Amphipolis was in the hands of the enemy caused great\r\nalarm at Athens. Not only was the town valuable for the timber it\r\nafforded for shipbuilding, and the money that it brought in; but also,\r\nalthough the escort of the Thessalians gave the Lacedaemonians a means\r\nof reaching the allies of Athens as far as the Strymon, yet as long as\r\nthey were not masters of the bridge but were watched on the side of\r\nEion by the Athenian galleys, and on the land side impeded by a large\r\nand extensive lake formed by the waters of the river, it was impossible\r\nfor them to go any further. Now, on the contrary, the path seemed open.\r\nThere was also the fear of the allies revolting, owing to the\r\nmoderation displayed by Brasidas in all his conduct, and to the\r\ndeclarations which he was everywhere making that he sent out to free\r\nHellas. The towns subject to the Athenians, hearing of the capture of\r\nAmphipolis and of the terms accorded to it, and of the gentleness of\r\nBrasidas, felt most strongly encouraged to change their condition, and\r\nsent secret messages to him, begging him to come on to them; each\r\nwishing to be the first to revolt. Indeed there seemed to be no danger\r\nin so doing; their mistake in their estimate of the Athenian power was\r\nas great as that power afterwards turned out to be, and their judgment\r\nwas based more upon blind wishing than upon any sound prevision; for it\r\nis a habit of mankind to entrust to careless hope what they long for,\r\nand to use sovereign reason to thrust aside what they do not fancy.\r\nBesides the late severe blow which the Athenians had met with in\r\nBoeotia, joined to the seductive, though untrue, statements of\r\nBrasidas, about the Athenians not having ventured to engage his single\r\narmy at Nisaea, made the allies confident, and caused them to believe\r\nthat no Athenian force would be sent against them. Above all the wish\r\nto do what was agreeable at the moment, and the likelihood that they\r\nshould find the Lacedaemonians full of zeal at starting, made them\r\neager to venture. Observing this, the Athenians sent garrisons to the\r\ndifferent towns, as far as was possible at such short notice and in\r\nwinter; while Brasidas sent dispatches to Lacedaemon asking for\r\nreinforcements, and himself made preparations for building galleys in\r\nthe Strymon. The Lacedaemonians however did not send him any, partly\r\nthrough envy on the part of their chief men, partly because they were\r\nmore bent on recovering the prisoners of the island and ending the war.\r\n\r\nThe same winter the Megarians took and razed to the foundations the\r\nlong walls which had been occupied by the Athenians; and Brasidas after\r\nthe capture of Amphipolis marched with his allies against Acte, a\r\npromontory running out from the King’s dike with an inward curve, and\r\nending in Athos, a lofty mountain looking towards the Aegean Sea. In it\r\nare various towns, Sane, an Andrian colony, close to the canal, and\r\nfacing the sea in the direction of Euboea; the others being Thyssus,\r\nCleone, Acrothoi, Olophyxus, and Dium, inhabited by mixed barbarian\r\nraces speaking the two languages. There is also a small Chalcidian\r\nelement; but the greater number are Tyrrheno-Pelasgians once settled in\r\nLemnos and Athens, and Bisaltians, Crestonians, and Edonians; the towns\r\nbeing all small ones. Most of these came over to Brasidas; but Sane and\r\nDium held out and saw their land ravaged by him and his army.\r\n\r\nUpon their not submitting, he at once marched against Torone in\r\nChalcidice, which was held by an Athenian garrison, having been invited\r\nby a few persons who were prepared to hand over the town. Arriving in\r\nthe dark a little before daybreak, he sat down with his army near the\r\ntemple of the Dioscuri, rather more than a quarter of a mile from the\r\ncity. The rest of the town of Torone and the Athenians in garrison did\r\nnot perceive his approach; but his partisans knowing that he was coming\r\n(a few of them had secretly gone out to meet him) were on the watch for\r\nhis arrival, and were no sooner aware of it than they took it to them\r\nseven light-armed men with daggers, who alone of twenty men ordered on\r\nthis service dared to enter, commanded by Lysistratus an Olynthian.\r\nThese passed through the sea wall, and without being seen went up and\r\nput to the sword the garrison of the highest post in the town, which\r\nstands on a hill, and broke open the postern on the side of\r\nCanastraeum.\r\n\r\nBrasidas meanwhile came a little nearer and then halted with his main\r\nbody, sending on one hundred targeteers to be ready to rush in first,\r\nthe moment that a gate should be thrown open and the beacon lighted as\r\nagreed. After some time passed in waiting and wondering at the delay,\r\nthe targeteers by degrees got up close to the town. The Toronaeans\r\ninside at work with the party that had entered had by this time broken\r\ndown the postern and opened the gates leading to the market-place by\r\ncutting through the bar, and first brought some men round and let them\r\nin by the postern, in order to strike a panic into the surprised\r\ntownsmen by suddenly attacking them from behind and on both sides at\r\nonce; after which they raised the fire-signal as had been agreed, and\r\ntook in by the market gates the rest of the targeteers.\r\n\r\nBrasidas seeing the signal told the troops to rise, and dashed forward\r\namid the loud hurrahs of his men, which carried dismay among the\r\nastonished townspeople. Some burst in straight by the gate, others over\r\nsome square pieces of timber placed against the wall (which has fallen\r\ndown and was being rebuilt) to draw up stones; Brasidas and the greater\r\nnumber making straight uphill for the higher part of the town, in order\r\nto take it from top to bottom, and once for all, while the rest of the\r\nmultitude spread in all directions.\r\n\r\nThe capture of the town was effected before the great body of the\r\nToronaeans had recovered from their surprise and confusion; but the\r\nconspirators and the citizens of their party at once joined the\r\ninvaders. About fifty of the Athenian heavy infantry happened to be\r\nsleeping in the market-place when the alarm reached them. A few of\r\nthese were killed fighting; the rest escaped, some by land, others to\r\nthe two ships on the station, and took refuge in Lecythus, a fort\r\ngarrisoned by their own men in the corner of the town running out into\r\nthe sea and cut off by a narrow isthmus; where they were joined by the\r\nToronaeans of their party.\r\n\r\nDay now arrived, and the town being secured, Brasidas made a\r\nproclamation to the Toronaeans who had taken refuge with the Athenians,\r\nto come out, as many as chose, to their homes without fearing for their\r\nrights or persons, and sent a herald to invite the Athenians to accept\r\na truce, and to evacuate Lecythus with their property, as being\r\nChalcidian ground. The Athenians refused this offer, but asked for a\r\ntruce for a day to take up their dead. Brasidas granted it for two\r\ndays, which he employed in fortifying the houses near, and the\r\nAthenians in doing the same to their positions. Meanwhile he called a\r\nmeeting of the Toronaeans, and said very much what he had said at\r\nAcanthus, namely, that they must not look upon those who had negotiated\r\nwith him for the capture of the town as bad men or as traitors, as they\r\nhad not acted as they had done from corrupt motives or in order to\r\nenslave the city, but for the good and freedom of Torone; nor again\r\nmust those who had not shared in the enterprise fancy that they would\r\nnot equally reap its fruits, as he had not come to destroy either city\r\nor individual. This was the reason of his proclamation to those that\r\nhad fled for refuge to the Athenians: he thought none the worse of them\r\nfor their friendship for the Athenians; he believed that they had only\r\nto make trial of the Lacedaemonians to like them as well, or even much\r\nbetter, as acting much more justly: it was for want of such a trial\r\nthat they were now afraid of them. Meanwhile he warned all of them to\r\nprepare to be staunch allies, and for being held responsible for all\r\nfaults in future: for the past, they had not wronged the Lacedaemonians\r\nbut had been wronged by others who were too strong for them, and any\r\nopposition that they might have offered him could be excused.\r\n\r\nHaving encouraged them with this address, as soon as the truce expired\r\nhe made his attack upon Lecythus; the Athenians defending themselves\r\nfrom a poor wall and from some houses with parapets. One day they beat\r\nhim off; the next the enemy were preparing to bring up an engine\r\nagainst them from which they meant to throw fire upon the wooden\r\ndefences, and the troops were already coming up to the point where they\r\nfancied they could best bring up the engine, and where place was most\r\nassailable; meanwhile the Athenians put a wooden tower upon a house\r\nopposite, and carried up a quantity of jars and casks of water and big\r\nstones, and a large number of men also climbed up. The house thus laden\r\ntoo heavily suddenly broke down with a loud crash; at which the men who\r\nwere near and saw it were more vexed than frightened; but those not so\r\nnear, and still more those furthest off, thought that the place was\r\nalready taken at that point, and fled in haste to the sea and the\r\nships.\r\n\r\nBrasidas, perceiving that they were deserting the parapet, and seeing\r\nwhat was going on, dashed forward with his troops, and immediately took\r\nthe fort, and put to the sword all whom he found in it. In this way the\r\nplace was evacuated by the Athenians, who went across in their boats\r\nand ships to Pallene. Now there is a temple of Athene in Lecythus, and\r\nBrasidas had proclaimed in the moment of making the assault that he\r\nwould give thirty silver minae to the man first on the wall. Being now\r\nof opinion that the capture was scarcely due to human means, he gave\r\nthe thirty minae to the goddess for her temple, and razed and cleared\r\nLecythus, and made the whole of it consecrated ground. The rest of the\r\nwinter he spent in settling the places in his hands, and in making\r\ndesigns upon the rest; and with the expiration of the winter the eighth\r\nyear of this war ended.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of the summer following, the Lacedaemonians and Athenians\r\nmade an armistice for a year; the Athenians thinking that they would\r\nthus have full leisure to take their precautions before Brasidas could\r\nprocure the revolt of any more of their towns, and might also, if it\r\nsuited them, conclude a general peace; the Lacedaemonians divining the\r\nactual fears of the Athenians, and thinking that after once tasting a\r\nrespite from trouble and misery they would be more disposed to consent\r\nto a reconciliation, and to give back the prisoners, and make a treaty\r\nfor the longer period. The great idea of the Lacedaemonians was to get\r\nback their men while Brasidas’s good fortune lasted: further successes\r\nmight make the struggle a less unequal one in Chalcidice, but would\r\nleave them still deprived of their men, and even in Chalcidice not more\r\nthan a match for the Athenians and by no means certain of victory. An\r\narmistice was accordingly concluded by Lacedaemon and her allies upon\r\nthe terms following:\r\n\r\n1. As to the temple and oracle of the Pythian Apollo, we are agreed\r\nthat whosoever will shall have access to it, without fraud or fear,\r\naccording to the usages of his forefathers. The Lacedaemonians and the\r\nallies present agree to this, and promise to send heralds to the\r\nBoeotians and Phocians, and to do their best to persuade them to agree\r\nlikewise.\r\n\r\n2. As to the treasure of the god, we agree to exert ourselves to detect\r\nall malversators, truly and honestly following the customs of our\r\nforefathers, we and you and all others willing to do so, all following\r\nthe customs of our forefathers. As to these points the Lacedaemonians\r\nand the other allies are agreed as has been said.\r\n\r\n3. As to what follows, the Lacedaemonians and the other allies agree,\r\nif the Athenians conclude a treaty, to remain, each of us in our own\r\nterritory, retaining our respective acquisitions: the garrison in\r\nCoryphasium keeping within Buphras and Tomeus: that in Cythera\r\nattempting no communication with the Peloponnesian confederacy, neither\r\nwe with them, nor they with us: that in Nisaea and Minoa not crossing\r\nthe road leading from the gates of the temple of Nisus to that of\r\nPoseidon and from thence straight to the bridge at Minoa: the Megarians\r\nand the allies being equally bound not to cross this road, and the\r\nAthenians retaining the island they have taken, without any\r\ncommunication on either side: as to Troezen, each side retaining what\r\nit has, and as was arranged with the Athenians.\r\n\r\n4. As to the use of the sea, so far as refers to their own coast and to\r\nthat of their confederacy, that the Lacedaemonians and their allies may\r\nvoyage upon it in any vessel rowed by oars and of not more than five\r\nhundred talents tonnage, not a vessel of war.\r\n\r\n5. That all heralds and embassies, with as many attendants as they\r\nplease, for concluding the war and adjusting claims, shall have free\r\npassage, going and coming, to Peloponnese or Athens by land and by sea.\r\n\r\n6. That during the truce, deserters whether bond or free shall be\r\nreceived neither by you, nor by us.\r\n\r\n7. Further, that satisfaction shall be given by you to us and by us to\r\nyou according to the public law of our several countries, all disputes\r\nbeing settled by law without recourse to hostilities.\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians and allies agree to these articles; but if you have\r\nanything fairer or juster to suggest, come to Lacedaemon and let us\r\nknow: whatever shall be just will meet with no objection either from\r\nthe Lacedaemonians or from the allies. Only let those who come come\r\nwith full powers, as you desire us. The truce shall be for one year.\r\n\r\nApproved by the people.\r\n\r\nThe tribe of Acamantis had the prytany, Phoenippus was secretary,\r\nNiciades chairman. Laches moved, in the name of the good luck of the\r\nAthenians, that they should conclude the armistice upon the terms\r\nagreed upon by the Lacedaemonians and the allies. It was agreed\r\naccordingly in the popular assembly that the armistice should be for\r\none year, beginning that very day, the fourteenth of the month of\r\nElaphebolion; during which time ambassadors and heralds should go and\r\ncome between the two countries to discuss the bases of a pacification.\r\nThat the generals and prytanes should call an assembly of the people,\r\nin which the Athenians should first consult on the peace, and on the\r\nmode in which the embassy for putting an end to the war should be\r\nadmitted. That the embassy now present should at once take the\r\nengagement before the people to keep well and truly this truce for one\r\nyear.\r\n\r\nOn these terms the Lacedaemonians concluded with the Athenians and\r\ntheir allies on the twelfth day of the Spartan month Gerastius; the\r\nallies also taking the oaths. Those who concluded and poured the\r\nlibation were Taurus, son of Echetimides, Athenaeus, son of\r\nPericleidas, and Philocharidas, son of Eryxidaidas, Lacedaemonians;\r\nAeneas, son of Ocytus, and Euphamidas, son of Aristonymus, Corinthians;\r\nDamotimus, son of Naucrates, and Onasimus, son of Megacles, Sicyonians;\r\nNicasus, son of Cecalus, and Menecrates, son of Amphidorus, Megarians;\r\nand Amphias, son of Eupaidas, an Epidaurian; and the Athenian generals\r\nNicostratus, son of Diitrephes, Nicias, son of Niceratus, and Autocles,\r\nson of Tolmaeus. Such was the armistice, and during the whole of it\r\nconferences went on on the subject of a pacification.\r\n\r\nIn the days in which they were going backwards and forwards to these\r\nconferences, Scione, a town in Pallene, revolted from Athens, and went\r\nover to Brasidas. The Scionaeans say that they are Pallenians from\r\nPeloponnese, and that their first founders on their voyage from Troy\r\nwere carried in to this spot by the storm which the Achaeans were\r\ncaught in, and there settled. The Scionaeans had no sooner revolted\r\nthan Brasidas crossed over by night to Scione, with a friendly galley\r\nahead and himself in a small boat some way behind; his idea being that\r\nif he fell in with a vessel larger than the boat he would have the\r\ngalley to defend him, while a ship that was a match for the galley\r\nwould probably neglect the small vessel to attack the large one, and\r\nthus leave him time to escape. His passage effected, he called a\r\nmeeting of the Scionaeans and spoke to the same effect as at Acanthus\r\nand Torone, adding that they merited the utmost commendation, in that,\r\nin spite of Pallene within the isthmus being cut off by the Athenian\r\noccupation of Potidæa and of their own practically insular position,\r\nthey had of their own free will gone forward to meet their liberty\r\ninstead of timorously waiting until they had been by force compelled to\r\ntheir own manifest good. This was a sign that they would valiantly\r\nundergo any trial, however great; and if he should order affairs as he\r\nintended, he should count them among the truest and sincerest friends\r\nof the Lacedaemonians, and would in every other way honour them.\r\n\r\nThe Scionaeans were elated by his language, and even those who had at\r\nfirst disapproved of what was being done catching the general\r\nconfidence, they determined on a vigorous conduct of the war, and\r\nwelcomed Brasidas with all possible honours, publicly crowning him with\r\na crown of gold as the liberator of Hellas; while private persons\r\ncrowded round him and decked him with garlands as though he had been an\r\nathlete. Meanwhile Brasidas left them a small garrison for the present\r\nand crossed back again, and not long afterwards sent over a larger\r\nforce, intending with the help of the Scionaeans to attempt Mende and\r\nPotidæa before the Athenians should arrive; Scione, he felt, being too\r\nlike an island for them not to relieve it. He had besides intelligence\r\nin the above towns about their betrayal.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of his designs upon the towns in question, a galley\r\narrived with the commissioners carrying round the news of the\r\narmistice, Aristonymus for the Athenians and Athenaeus for the\r\nLacedaemonians. The troops now crossed back to Torone, and the\r\ncommissioners gave Brasidas notice of the convention. All the\r\nLacedaemonian allies in Thrace accepted what had been done; and\r\nAristonymus made no difficulty about the rest, but finding, on counting\r\nthe days, that the Scionaeans had revolted after the date of the\r\nconvention, refused to include them in it. To this Brasidas earnestly\r\nobjected, asserting that the revolt took place before, and would not\r\ngive up the town. Upon Aristonymus reporting the case to Athens, the\r\npeople at once prepared to send an expedition to Scione. Upon this,\r\nenvoys arrived from Lacedaemon, alleging that this would be a breach of\r\nthe truce, and laying claim to the town upon the faith of the assertion\r\nof Brasidas, and meanwhile offering to submit the question to\r\narbitration. Arbitration, however, was what the Athenians did not\r\nchoose to risk; being determined to send troops at once to the place,\r\nand furious at the idea of even the islanders now daring to revolt, in\r\na vain reliance upon the power of the Lacedaemonians by land. Besides\r\nthe facts of the revolt were rather as the Athenians contended, the\r\nScionaeans having revolted two days after the convention. Cleon\r\naccordingly succeeded in carrying a decree to reduce and put to death\r\nthe Scionaeans; and the Athenians employed the leisure which they now\r\nenjoyed in preparing for the expedition.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Mende revolted, a town in Pallene and a colony of the\r\nEretrians, and was received without scruple by Brasidas, in spite of\r\nits having evidently come over during the armistice, on account of\r\ncertain infringements of the truce alleged by him against the\r\nAthenians. This audacity of Mende was partly caused by seeing Brasidas\r\nforward in the matter and by the conclusions drawn from his refusal to\r\nbetray Scione; and besides, the conspirators in Mende were few, and, as\r\nI have already intimated, had carried on their practices too long not\r\nto fear detection for themselves, and not to wish to force the\r\ninclination of the multitude. This news made the Athenians more furious\r\nthan ever, and they at once prepared against both towns. Brasidas,\r\nexpecting their arrival, conveyed away to Olynthus in Chalcidice the\r\nwomen and children of the Scionaeans and Mendaeans, and sent over to\r\nthem five hundred Peloponnesian heavy infantry and three hundred\r\nChalcidian targeteers, all under the command of Polydamidas.\r\n\r\nLeaving these two towns to prepare together against the speedy arrival\r\nof the Athenians, Brasidas and Perdiccas started on a second joint\r\nexpedition into Lyncus against Arrhabaeus; the latter with the forces\r\nof his Macedonian subjects, and a corps of heavy infantry composed of\r\nHellenes domiciled in the country; the former with the Peloponnesians\r\nwhom he still had with him and the Chalcidians, Acanthians, and the\r\nrest in such force as they were able. In all there were about three\r\nthousand Hellenic heavy infantry, accompanied by all the Macedonian\r\ncavalry with the Chalcidians, near one thousand strong, besides an\r\nimmense crowd of barbarians. On entering the country of Arrhabaeus,\r\nthey found the Lyncestians encamped awaiting them, and themselves took\r\nup a position opposite. The infantry on either side were upon a hill,\r\nwith a plain between them, into which the horse of both armies first\r\ngalloped down and engaged a cavalry action. After this the Lyncestian\r\nheavy infantry advanced from their hill to join their cavalry and\r\noffered battle; upon which Brasidas and Perdiccas also came down to\r\nmeet them, and engaged and routed them with heavy loss; the survivors\r\ntaking refuge upon the heights and there remaining inactive. The\r\nvictors now set up a trophy and waited two or three days for the\r\nIllyrian mercenaries who were to join Perdiccas. Perdiccas then wished\r\nto go on and attack the villages of Arrhabaeus, and to sit still no\r\nlonger; but Brasidas, afraid that the Athenians might sail up during\r\nhis absence, and of something happening to Mende, and seeing besides\r\nthat the Illyrians did not appear, far from seconding this wish was\r\nanxious to return.\r\n\r\nWhile they were thus disputing, the news arrived that the Illyrians had\r\nactually betrayed Perdiccas and had joined Arrhabaeus; and the fear\r\ninspired by their warlike character made both parties now think it best\r\nto retreat. However, owing to the dispute, nothing had been settled as\r\nto when they should start; and night coming on, the Macedonians and the\r\nbarbarian crowd took fright in a moment in one of those mysterious\r\npanics to which great armies are liable; and persuaded that an army\r\nmany times more numerous than that which had really arrived was\r\nadvancing and all but upon them, suddenly broke and fled in the\r\ndirection of home, and thus compelled Perdiccas, who at first did not\r\nperceive what had occurred, to depart without seeing Brasidas, the two\r\narmies being encamped at a considerable distance from each other. At\r\ndaybreak Brasidas, perceiving that the Macedonians had gone on, and\r\nthat the Illyrians and Arrhabaeus were on the point of attacking him,\r\nformed his heavy infantry into a square, with the light troops in the\r\ncentre, and himself also prepared to retreat. Posting his youngest\r\nsoldiers to dash out wherever the enemy should attack them, he himself\r\nwith three hundred picked men in the rear intended to face about during\r\nthe retreat and beat off the most forward of their assailants,\r\nMeanwhile, before the enemy approached, he sought to sustain the\r\ncourage of his soldiers with the following hasty exhortation:\r\n\r\n“Peloponnesians, if I did not suspect you of being dismayed at being\r\nleft alone to sustain the attack of a numerous and barbarian enemy, I\r\nshould just have said a few words to you as usual without further\r\nexplanation. As it is, in the face of the desertion of our friends and\r\nthe numbers of the enemy, I have some advice and information to offer,\r\nwhich, brief as they must be, will, I hope, suffice for the more\r\nimportant points. The bravery that you habitually display in war does\r\nnot depend on your having allies at your side in this or that\r\nencounter, but on your native courage; nor have numbers any terrors for\r\ncitizens of states like yours, in which the many do not rule the few,\r\nbut rather the few the many, owing their position to nothing else than\r\nto superiority in the field. Inexperience now makes you afraid of\r\nbarbarians; and yet the trial of strength which you had with the\r\nMacedonians among them, and my own judgment, confirmed by what I hear\r\nfrom others, should be enough to satisfy you that they will not prove\r\nformidable. Where an enemy seems strong but is really weak, a true\r\nknowledge of the facts makes his adversary the bolder, just as a\r\nserious antagonist is encountered most confidently by those who do not\r\nknow him. Thus the present enemy might terrify an inexperienced\r\nimagination; they are formidable in outward bulk, their loud yelling is\r\nunbearable, and the brandishing of their weapons in the air has a\r\nthreatening appearance. But when it comes to real fighting with an\r\nopponent who stands his ground, they are not what they seemed; they\r\nhave no regular order that they should be ashamed of deserting their\r\npositions when hard pressed; flight and attack are with them equally\r\nhonourable, and afford no test of courage; their independent mode of\r\nfighting never leaving any one who wants to run away without a fair\r\nexcuse for so doing. In short, they think frightening you at a secure\r\ndistance a surer game than meeting you hand to hand; otherwise they\r\nwould have done the one and not the other. You can thus plainly see\r\nthat the terrors with which they were at first invested are in fact\r\ntrifling enough, though to the eye and ear very prominent. Stand your\r\nground therefore when they advance, and again wait your opportunity to\r\nretire in good order, and you will reach a place of safety all the\r\nsooner, and will know for ever afterwards that rabble such as these, to\r\nthose who sustain their first attack, do but show off their courage by\r\nthreats of the terrible things that they are going to do, at a\r\ndistance, but with those who give way to them are quick enough to\r\ndisplay their heroism in pursuit when they can do so without danger.”\r\n\r\nWith this brief address Brasidas began to lead off his army. Seeing\r\nthis, the barbarians came on with much shouting and hubbub, thinking\r\nthat he was flying and that they would overtake him and cut him off.\r\nBut wherever they charged they found the young men ready to dash out\r\nagainst them, while Brasidas with his picked company sustained their\r\nonset. Thus the Peloponnesians withstood the first attack, to the\r\nsurprise of the enemy, and afterwards received and repulsed them as\r\nfast as they came on, retiring as soon as their opponents became quiet.\r\nThe main body of the barbarians ceased therefore to molest the Hellenes\r\nwith Brasidas in the open country, and leaving behind a certain number\r\nto harass their march, the rest went on after the flying Macedonians,\r\nslaying those with whom they came up, and so arrived in time to occupy\r\nthe narrow pass between two hills that leads into the country of\r\nArrhabaeus. They knew that this was the only way by which Brasidas\r\ncould retreat, and now proceeded to surround him just as he entered the\r\nmost impracticable part of the road, in order to cut him off.\r\n\r\nBrasidas, perceiving their intention, told his three hundred to run on\r\nwithout order, each as quickly as he could, to the hill which seemed\r\neasiest to take, and to try to dislodge the barbarians already there,\r\nbefore they should be joined by the main body closing round him. These\r\nattacked and overpowered the party upon the hill, and the main army of\r\nthe Hellenes now advanced with less difficulty towards it—the\r\nbarbarians being terrified at seeing their men on that side driven from\r\nthe height and no longer following the main body, who, they considered,\r\nhad gained the frontier and made good their escape. The heights once\r\ngained, Brasidas now proceeded more securely, and the same day arrived\r\nat Arnisa, the first town in the dominions of Perdiccas. The soldiers,\r\nenraged at the desertion of the Macedonians, vented their rage on all\r\ntheir yokes of oxen which they found on the road, and on any baggage\r\nwhich had tumbled off (as might easily happen in the panic of a night\r\nretreat), by unyoking and cutting down the cattle and taking the\r\nbaggage for themselves. From this moment Perdiccas began to regard\r\nBrasidas as an enemy and to feel against the Peloponnesians a hatred\r\nwhich could not be congenial to the adversary of the Athenians.\r\nHowever, he departed from his natural interests and made it his\r\nendeavour to come to terms with the latter and to get rid of the\r\nformer.\r\n\r\nOn his return from Macedonia to Torone, Brasidas found the Athenians\r\nalready masters of Mende, and remained quiet where he was, thinking it\r\nnow out of his power to cross over into Pallene and assist the\r\nMendaeans, but he kept good watch over Torone. For about the same time\r\nas the campaign in Lyncus, the Athenians sailed upon the expedition\r\nwhich we left them preparing against Mende and Scione, with fifty\r\nships, ten of which were Chians, one thousand Athenian heavy infantry\r\nand six hundred archers, one hundred Thracian mercenaries and some\r\ntargeteers drawn from their allies in the neighbourhood, under the\r\ncommand of Nicias, son of Niceratus, and Nicostratus, son of\r\nDiitrephes. Weighing from Potidæa, the fleet came to land opposite the\r\ntemple of Poseidon, and proceeded against Mende; the men of which town,\r\nreinforced by three hundred Scionaeans, with their Peloponnesian\r\nauxiliaries, seven hundred heavy infantry in all, under Polydamidas,\r\nthey found encamped upon a strong hill outside the city. These Nicias,\r\nwith one hundred and twenty light-armed Methonaeans, sixty picked men\r\nfrom the Athenian heavy infantry, and all the archers, tried to reach\r\nby a path running up the hill, but received a wound and found himself\r\nunable to force the position; while Nicostratus, with all the rest of\r\nthe army, advancing upon the hill, which was naturally difficult, by a\r\ndifferent approach further off, was thrown into utter disorder; and the\r\nwhole Athenian army narrowly escaped being defeated. For that day, as\r\nthe Mendaeans and their allies showed no signs of yielding, the\r\nAthenians retreated and encamped, and the Mendaeans at nightfall\r\nreturned into the town.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Athenians sailed round to the Scione side, and took\r\nthe suburb, and all day plundered the country, without any one coming\r\nout against them, partly because of intestine disturbances in the town;\r\nand the following night the three hundred Scionaeans returned home. On\r\nthe morrow Nicias advanced with half the army to the frontier of Scione\r\nand laid waste the country; while Nicostratus with the remainder sat\r\ndown before the town near the upper gate on the road to Potidæa. The\r\narms of the Mendaeans and of their Peloponnesian auxiliaries within the\r\nwall happened to be piled in that quarter, where Polydamidas\r\naccordingly began to draw them up for battle, encouraging the Mendaeans\r\nto make a sortie. At this moment one of the popular party answered him\r\nfactiously that they would not go out and did not want a war, and for\r\nthus answering was dragged by the arm and knocked about by Polydamidas.\r\nHereupon the infuriated commons at once seized their arms and rushed at\r\nthe Peloponnesians and at their allies of the opposite faction. The\r\ntroops thus assaulted were at once routed, partly from the suddenness\r\nof the conflict and partly through fear of the gates being opened to\r\nthe Athenians, with whom they imagined that the attack had been\r\nconcerted. As many as were not killed on the spot took refuge in the\r\ncitadel, which they had held from the first; and the whole, Athenian\r\narmy, Nicias having by this time returned and being close to the city,\r\nnow burst into Mende, which had opened its gates without any\r\nconvention, and sacked it just as if they had taken it by storm, the\r\ngenerals even finding some difficulty in restraining them from also\r\nmassacring the inhabitants. After this the Athenians told the Mendaeans\r\nthat they might retain their civil rights, and themselves judge the\r\nsupposed authors of the revolt; and cut off the party in the citadel by\r\na wall built down to the sea on either side, appointing troops to\r\nmaintain the blockade. Having thus secured Mende, they proceeded\r\nagainst Scione.\r\n\r\nThe Scionaeans and Peloponnesians marched out against them, occupying a\r\nstrong hill in front of the town, which had to be captured by the enemy\r\nbefore they could invest the place. The Athenians stormed the hill,\r\ndefeated and dislodged its occupants, and, having encamped and set up a\r\ntrophy, prepared for the work of circumvallation. Not long after they\r\nhad begun their operations, the auxiliaries besieged in the citadel of\r\nMende forced the guard by the sea-side and arrived by night at Scione,\r\ninto which most of them succeeded in entering, passing through the\r\nbesieging army.\r\n\r\nWhile the investment of Scione was in progress, Perdiccas sent a herald\r\nto the Athenian generals and made peace with the Athenians, through\r\nspite against Brasidas for the retreat from Lyncus, from which moment\r\nindeed he had begun to negotiate. The Lacedaemonian Ischagoras was just\r\nthen upon the point of starting with an army overland to join Brasidas;\r\nand Perdiccas, being now required by Nicias to give some proof of the\r\nsincerity of his reconciliation to the Athenians, and being himself no\r\nlonger disposed to let the Peloponnesians into his country, put in\r\nmotion his friends in Thessaly, with whose chief men he always took\r\ncare to have relations, and so effectually stopped the army and its\r\npreparation that they did not even try the Thessalians. Ischagoras\r\nhimself, however, with Ameinias and Aristeus, succeeded in reaching\r\nBrasidas; they had been commissioned by the Lacedaemonians to inspect\r\nthe state of affairs, and brought out from Sparta (in violation of all\r\nprecedent) some of their young men to put in command of the towns, to\r\nguard against their being entrusted to the persons upon the spot.\r\nBrasidas accordingly placed Clearidas, son of Cleonymus, in Amphipolis,\r\nand Pasitelidas, son of Hegesander, in Torone.\r\n\r\nThe same summer the Thebans dismantled the wall of the Thespians on the\r\ncharge of Atticism, having always wished to do so, and now finding it\r\nan easy matter, as the flower of the Thespian youth had perished in the\r\nbattle with the Athenians. The same summer also the temple of Hera at\r\nArgos was burnt down, through Chrysis, the priestess, placing a lighted\r\ntorch near the garlands and then falling asleep, so that they all\r\ncaught fire and were in a blaze before she observed it. Chrysis that\r\nvery night fled to Phlius for fear of the Argives, who, agreeably to\r\nthe law in such a case, appointed another priestess named Phaeinis.\r\nChrysis at the time of her flight had been priestess for eight years of\r\nthe present war and half the ninth. At the close of the summer the\r\ninvestment of Scione was completed, and the Athenians, leaving a\r\ndetachment to maintain the blockade, returned with the rest of their\r\narmy.\r\n\r\nDuring the winter following, the Athenians and Lacedaemonians were kept\r\nquiet by the armistice; but the Mantineans and Tegeans, and their\r\nrespective allies, fought a battle at Laodicium, in the Oresthid. The\r\nvictory remained doubtful, as each side routed one of the wings opposed\r\nto them, and both set up trophies and sent spoils to Delphi. After\r\nheavy loss on both sides the battle was undecided, and night\r\ninterrupted the action; yet the Tegeans passed the night on the field\r\nand set up a trophy at once, while the Mantineans withdrew to Bucolion\r\nand set up theirs afterwards.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the same winter, in fact almost in spring, Brasidas\r\nmade an attempt upon Potidæa. He arrived by night, and succeeded in\r\nplanting a ladder against the wall without being discovered, the ladder\r\nbeing planted just in the interval between the passing round of the\r\nbell and the return of the man who brought it back. Upon the garrison,\r\nhowever, taking the alarm immediately afterwards, before his men came\r\nup, he quickly led off his troops, without waiting until it was day. So\r\nended the winter and the ninth year of this war of which Thucydides is\r\nthe historian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK V\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV\r\n\r\n\r\nTenth Year of the War—Death of Cleon and Brasidas—Peace of Nicias\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next summer the truce for a year ended, after lasting until the\r\nPythian games. During the armistice the Athenians expelled the Delians\r\nfrom Delos, concluding that they must have been polluted by some old\r\noffence at the time of their consecration, and that this had been the\r\nomission in the previous purification of the island, which, as I have\r\nrelated, had been thought to have been duly accomplished by the removal\r\nof the graves of the dead. The Delians had Atramyttium in Asia given\r\nthem by Pharnaces, and settled there as they removed from Delos.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Cleon prevailed on the Athenians to let him set sail at the\r\nexpiration of the armistice for the towns in the direction of Thrace\r\nwith twelve hundred heavy infantry and three hundred horse from Athens,\r\na large force of the allies, and thirty ships. First touching at the\r\nstill besieged Scione, and taking some heavy infantry from the army\r\nthere, he next sailed into Cophos, a harbour in the territory of\r\nTorone, which is not far from the town. From thence, having learnt from\r\ndeserters that Brasidas was not in Torone, and that its garrison was\r\nnot strong enough to give him battle, he advanced with his army against\r\nthe town, sending ten ships to sail round into the harbour. He first\r\ncame to the fortification lately thrown up in front of the town by\r\nBrasidas in order to take in the suburb, to do which he had pulled down\r\npart of the original wall and made it all one city. To this point\r\nPasitelidas, the Lacedaemonian commander, with such garrison as there\r\nwas in the place, hurried to repel the Athenian assault; but finding\r\nhimself hard pressed, and seeing the ships that had been sent round\r\nsailing into the harbour, Pasitelidas began to be afraid that they\r\nmight get up to the city before its defenders were there and, the\r\nfortification being also carried, he might be taken prisoner, and so\r\nabandoned the outwork and ran into the town. But the Athenians from the\r\nships had already taken Torone, and their land forces following at his\r\nheels burst in with him with a rush over the part of the old wall that\r\nhad been pulled down, killing some of the Peloponnesians and Toronaeans\r\nin the melee, and making prisoners of the rest, and Pasitelidas their\r\ncommander amongst them. Brasidas meanwhile had advanced to relieve\r\nTorone, and had only about four miles more to go when he heard of its\r\nfall on the road, and turned back again. Cleon and the Athenians set up\r\ntwo trophies, one by the harbour, the other by the fortification and,\r\nmaking slaves of the wives and children of the Toronaeans, sent the men\r\nwith the Peloponnesians and any Chalcidians that were there, to the\r\nnumber of seven hundred, to Athens; whence, however, they all came home\r\nafterwards, the Peloponnesians on the conclusion of peace, and the rest\r\nby being exchanged against other prisoners with the Olynthians. About\r\nthe same time Panactum, a fortress on the Athenian border, was taken by\r\ntreachery by the Boeotians. Meanwhile Cleon, after placing a garrison\r\nin Torone, weighed anchor and sailed around Athos on his way to\r\nAmphipolis.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Phaeax, son of Erasistratus, set sail with two\r\ncolleagues as ambassador from Athens to Italy and Sicily. The\r\nLeontines, upon the departure of the Athenians from Sicily after the\r\npacification, had placed a number of new citizens upon the roll, and\r\nthe commons had a design for redividing the land; but the upper\r\nclasses, aware of their intention, called in the Syracusans and\r\nexpelled the commons. These last were scattered in various directions;\r\nbut the upper classes came to an agreement with the Syracusans,\r\nabandoned and laid waste their city, and went and lived at Syracuse,\r\nwhere they were made citizens. Afterwards some of them were\r\ndissatisfied, and leaving Syracuse occupied Phocaeae, a quarter of the\r\ntown of Leontini, and Bricinniae, a strong place in the Leontine\r\ncountry, and being there joined by most of the exiled commons carried\r\non war from the fortifications. The Athenians hearing this, sent Phaeax\r\nto see if they could not by some means so convince their allies there\r\nand the rest of the Sicilians of the ambitious designs of Syracuse as\r\nto induce them to form a general coalition against her, and thus save\r\nthe commons of Leontini. Arrived in Sicily, Phaeax succeeded at\r\nCamarina and Agrigentum, but meeting with a repulse at Gela did not go\r\non to the rest, as he saw that he should not succeed with them, but\r\nreturned through the country of the Sicels to Catana, and after\r\nvisiting Bricinniae as he passed, and encouraging its inhabitants,\r\nsailed back to Athens.\r\n\r\nDuring his voyage along the coast to and from Sicily, he treated with\r\nsome cities in Italy on the subject of friendship with Athens, and also\r\nfell in with some Locrian settlers exiled from Messina, who had been\r\nsent thither when the Locrians were called in by one of the factions\r\nthat divided Messina after the pacification of Sicily, and Messina came\r\nfor a time into the hands of the Locrians. These being met by Phaeax on\r\ntheir return home received no injury at his hands, as the Locrians had\r\nagreed with him for a treaty with Athens. They were the only people of\r\nthe allies who, when the reconciliation between the Sicilians took\r\nplace, had not made peace with her; nor indeed would they have done so\r\nnow, if they had not been pressed by a war with the Hipponians and\r\nMedmaeans who lived on their border, and were colonists of theirs.\r\nPhaeax meanwhile proceeded on his voyage, and at length arrived at\r\nAthens.\r\n\r\nCleon, whom we left on his voyage from Torone to Amphipolis, made Eion\r\nhis base, and after an unsuccessful assault upon the Andrian colony of\r\nStagirus, took Galepsus, a colony of Thasos, by storm. He now sent\r\nenvoys to Perdiccas to command his attendance with an army, as provided\r\nby the alliance; and others to Thrace, to Polles, king of the\r\nOdomantians, who was to bring as many Thracian mercenaries as possible;\r\nand himself remained inactive in Eion, awaiting their arrival. Informed\r\nof this, Brasidas on his part took up a position of observation upon\r\nCerdylium, a place situated in the Argilian country on high ground\r\nacross the river, not far from Amphipolis, and commanding a view on all\r\nsides, and thus made it impossible for Cleon’s army to move without his\r\nseeing it; for he fully expected that Cleon, despising the scanty\r\nnumbers of his opponent, would march against Amphipolis with the force\r\nthat he had got with him. At the same time Brasidas made his\r\npreparations, calling to his standard fifteen hundred Thracian\r\nmercenaries and all the Edonians, horse and targeteers; he also had a\r\nthousand Myrcinian and Chalcidian targeteers, besides those in\r\nAmphipolis, and a force of heavy infantry numbering altogether about\r\ntwo thousand, and three hundred Hellenic horse. Fifteen hundred of\r\nthese he had with him upon Cerdylium; the rest were stationed with\r\nClearidas in Amphipolis.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining quiet for some time, Cleon was at length obliged to do\r\nas Brasidas expected. His soldiers, tired of their inactivity, began\r\nalso seriously to reflect on the weakness and incompetence of their\r\ncommander, and the skill and valour that would be opposed to him, and\r\non their own original unwillingness to accompany him. These murmurs\r\ncoming to the ears of Cleon, he resolved not to disgust the army by\r\nkeeping it in the same place, and broke up his camp and advanced. The\r\ntemper of the general was what it had been at Pylos, his success on\r\nthat occasion having given him confidence in his capacity. He never\r\ndreamed of any one coming out to fight him, but said that he was rather\r\ngoing up to view the place; and if he waited for his reinforcements, it\r\nwas not in order to make victory secure in case he should be compelled\r\nto engage, but to be enabled to surround and storm the city. He\r\naccordingly came and posted his army upon a strong hill in front of\r\nAmphipolis, and proceeded to examine the lake formed by the Strymon,\r\nand how the town lay on the side of Thrace. He thought to retire at\r\npleasure without fighting, as there was no one to be seen upon the wall\r\nor coming out of the gates, all of which were shut. Indeed, it seemed a\r\nmistake not to have brought down engines with him; he could then have\r\ntaken the town, there being no one to defend it.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Brasidas saw the Athenians in motion he descended himself\r\nfrom Cerdylium and entered Amphipolis. He did not venture to go out in\r\nregular order against the Athenians: he mistrusted his strength, and\r\nthought it inadequate to the attempt; not in numbers—these were not so\r\nunequal—but in quality, the flower of the Athenian army being in the\r\nfield, with the best of the Lemnians and Imbrians. He therefore\r\nprepared to assail them by stratagem. By showing the enemy the number\r\nof his troops, and the shifts which he had been put to to to arm them,\r\nhe thought that he should have less chance of beating him than by not\r\nletting him have a sight of them, and thus learn how good a right he\r\nhad to despise them. He accordingly picked out a hundred and fifty\r\nheavy infantry and, putting the rest under Clearidas, determined to\r\nattack suddenly before the Athenians retired; thinking that he should\r\nnot have again such a chance of catching them alone, if their\r\nreinforcements were once allowed to come up; and so calling all his\r\nsoldiers together in order to encourage them and explain his intention,\r\nspoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“Peloponnesians, the character of the country from which we have come,\r\none which has always owed its freedom to valour, and the fact that you\r\nare Dorians and the enemy you are about to fight Ionians, whom you are\r\naccustomed to beat, are things that do not need further comment. But\r\nthe plan of attack that I propose to pursue, this it is as well to\r\nexplain, in order that the fact of our adventuring with a part instead\r\nof with the whole of our forces may not damp your courage by the\r\napparent disadvantage at which it places you. I imagine it is the poor\r\nopinion that he has of us, and the fact that he has no idea of any one\r\ncoming out to engage him, that has made the enemy march up to the place\r\nand carelessly look about him as he is doing, without noticing us. But\r\nthe most successful soldier will always be the man who most happily\r\ndetects a blunder like this, and who carefully consulting his own means\r\nmakes his attack not so much by open and regular approaches, as by\r\nseizing the opportunity of the moment; and these stratagems, which do\r\nthe greatest service to our friends by most completely deceiving our\r\nenemies, have the most brilliant name in war. Therefore, while their\r\ncareless confidence continues, and they are still thinking, as in my\r\njudgment they are now doing, more of retreat than of maintaining their\r\nposition, while their spirit is slack and not high-strung with\r\nexpectation, I with the men under my command will, if possible, take\r\nthem by surprise and fall with a run upon their centre; and do you,\r\nClearidas, afterwards, when you see me already upon them, and, as is\r\nlikely, dealing terror among them, take with you the Amphipolitans, and\r\nthe rest of the allies, and suddenly open the gates and dash at them,\r\nand hasten to engage as quickly as you can. That is our best chance of\r\nestablishing a panic among them, as a fresh assailant has always more\r\nterrors for an enemy than the one he is immediately engaged with. Show\r\nyourself a brave man, as a Spartan should; and do you, allies, follow\r\nhim like men, and remember that zeal, honour, and obedience mark the\r\ngood soldier, and that this day will make you either free men and\r\nallies of Lacedaemon, or slaves of Athens; even if you escape without\r\npersonal loss of liberty or life, your bondage will be on harsher terms\r\nthan before, and you will also hinder the liberation of the rest of the\r\nHellenes. No cowardice then on your part, seeing the greatness of the\r\nissues at stake, and I will show that what I preach to others I can\r\npractise myself.”\r\n\r\nAfter this brief speech Brasidas himself prepared for the sally, and\r\nplaced the rest with Clearidas at the Thracian gates to support him as\r\nhad been agreed. Meanwhile he had been seen coming down from Cerdylium\r\nand then in the city, which is overlooked from the outside, sacrificing\r\nnear the temple of Athene; in short, all his movements had been\r\nobserved, and word was brought to Cleon, who had at the moment gone on\r\nto look about him, that the whole of the enemy’s force could be seen in\r\nthe town, and that the feet of horses and men in great numbers were\r\nvisible under the gates, as if a sally were intended. Upon hearing this\r\nhe went up to look, and having done so, being unwilling to venture upon\r\nthe decisive step of a battle before his reinforcements came up, and\r\nfancying that he would have time to retire, bid the retreat be sounded\r\nand sent orders to the men to effect it by moving on the left wing in\r\nthe direction of Eion, which was indeed the only way practicable. This\r\nhowever not being quick enough for him, he joined the retreat in person\r\nand made the right wing wheel round, thus turning its unarmed side to\r\nthe enemy. It was then that Brasidas, seeing the Athenian force in\r\nmotion and his opportunity come, said to the men with him and the rest:\r\n“Those fellows will never stand before us, one can see that by the way\r\ntheir spears and heads are going. Troops which do as they do seldom\r\nstand a charge. Quick, someone, and open the gates I spoke of, and let\r\nus be out and at them with no fears for the result.” Accordingly\r\nissuing out by the palisade gate and by the first in the long wall then\r\nexisting, he ran at the top of his speed along the straight road, where\r\nthe trophy now stands as you go by the steepest part of the hill, and\r\nfell upon and routed the centre of the Athenians, panic-stricken by\r\ntheir own disorder and astounded at his audacity. At the same moment\r\nClearidas in execution of his orders issued out from the Thracian gates\r\nto support him, and also attacked the enemy. The result was that the\r\nAthenians, suddenly and unexpectedly attacked on both sides, fell into\r\nconfusion; and their left towards Eion, which had already got on some\r\ndistance, at once broke and fled. Just as it was in full retreat and\r\nBrasidas was passing on to attack the right, he received a wound; but\r\nhis fall was not perceived by the Athenians, as he was taken up by\r\nthose near him and carried off the field. The Athenian right made a\r\nbetter stand, and though Cleon, who from the first had no thought of\r\nfighting, at once fled and was overtaken and slain by a Myrcinian\r\ntargeteer, his infantry forming in close order upon the hill twice or\r\nthrice repulsed the attacks of Clearidas, and did not finally give way\r\nuntil they were surrounded and routed by the missiles of the Myrcinian\r\nand Chalcidian horse and the targeteers. Thus the Athenian army was all\r\nnow in flight; and such as escaped being killed in the battle, or by\r\nthe Chalcidian horse and the targeteers, dispersed among the hills, and\r\nwith difficulty made their way to Eion. The men who had taken up and\r\nrescued Brasidas, brought him into the town with the breath still in\r\nhim: he lived to hear of the victory of his troops, and not long after\r\nexpired. The rest of the army returning with Clearidas from the pursuit\r\nstripped the dead and set up a trophy.\r\n\r\nAfter this all the allies attended in arms and buried Brasidas at the\r\npublic expense in the city, in front of what is now the marketplace,\r\nand the Amphipolitans, having enclosed his tomb, ever afterwards\r\nsacrifice to him as a hero and have given to him the honour of games\r\nand annual offerings. They constituted him the founder of their colony,\r\nand pulled down the Hagnonic erections, and obliterated everything that\r\ncould be interpreted as a memorial of his having founded the place; for\r\nthey considered that Brasidas had been their preserver, and courting as\r\nthey did the alliance of Lacedaemon for fear of Athens, in their\r\npresent hostile relations with the latter they could no longer with the\r\nsame advantage or satisfaction pay Hagnon his honours. They also gave\r\nthe Athenians back their dead. About six hundred of the latter had\r\nfallen and only seven of the enemy, owing to there having been no\r\nregular engagement, but the affair of accident and panic that I have\r\ndescribed. After taking up their dead the Athenians sailed off home,\r\nwhile Clearidas and his troops remained to arrange matters at\r\nAmphipolis.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time three Lacedaemonians—Ramphias, Autocharidas, and\r\nEpicydidas—led a reinforcement of nine hundred heavy infantry to the\r\ntowns in the direction of Thrace, and arriving at Heraclea in Trachis\r\nreformed matters there as seemed good to them. While they delayed\r\nthere, this battle took place and so the summer ended.\r\n\r\nWith the beginning of the winter following, Ramphias and his companions\r\npenetrated as far as Pierium in Thessaly; but as the Thessalians\r\nopposed their further advance, and Brasidas whom they came to reinforce\r\nwas dead, they turned back home, thinking that the moment had gone by,\r\nthe Athenians being defeated and gone, and themselves not equal to the\r\nexecution of Brasidas’s designs. The main cause however of their return\r\nwas because they knew that when they set out Lacedaemonian opinion was\r\nreally in favour of peace.\r\n\r\nIndeed it so happened that directly after the battle of Amphipolis and\r\nthe retreat of Ramphias from Thessaly, both sides ceased to prosecute\r\nthe war and turned their attention to peace. Athens had suffered\r\nseverely at Delium, and again shortly afterwards at Amphipolis, and had\r\nno longer that confidence in her strength which had made her before\r\nrefuse to treat, in the belief of ultimate victory which her success at\r\nthe moment had inspired; besides, she was afraid of her allies being\r\ntempted by her reverses to rebel more generally, and repented having\r\nlet go the splendid opportunity for peace which the affair of Pylos had\r\noffered. Lacedaemon, on the other hand, found the event of the war to\r\nfalsify her notion that a few years would suffice for the overthrow of\r\nthe power of the Athenians by the devastation of their land. She had\r\nsuffered on the island a disaster hitherto unknown at Sparta; she saw\r\nher country plundered from Pylos and Cythera; the Helots were\r\ndeserting, and she was in constant apprehension that those who remained\r\nin Peloponnese would rely upon those outside and take advantage of the\r\nsituation to renew their old attempts at revolution. Besides this, as\r\nchance would have it, her thirty years’ truce with the Argives was upon\r\nthe point of expiring; and they refused to renew it unless Cynuria were\r\nrestored to them; so that it seemed impossible to fight Argos and\r\nAthens at once. She also suspected some of the cities in Peloponnese of\r\nintending to go over to the enemy and that was indeed the case.\r\n\r\nThese considerations made both sides disposed for an accommodation; the\r\nLacedaemonians being probably the most eager, as they ardently desired\r\nto recover the men taken upon the island, the Spartans among whom\r\nbelonged to the first families and were accordingly related to the\r\ngoverning body in Lacedaemon. Negotiations had been begun directly\r\nafter their capture, but the Athenians in their hour of triumph would\r\nnot consent to any reasonable terms; though after their defeat at\r\nDelium, Lacedaemon, knowing that they would be now more inclined to\r\nlisten, at once concluded the armistice for a year, during which they\r\nwere to confer together and see if a longer period could not be agreed\r\nupon.\r\n\r\nNow, however, after the Athenian defeat at Amphipolis, and the death of\r\nCleon and Brasidas, who had been the two principal opponents of peace\r\non either side—the latter from the success and honour which war gave\r\nhim, the former because he thought that, if tranquillity were restored,\r\nhis crimes would be more open to detection and his slanders less\r\ncredited—the foremost candidates for power in either city, Pleistoanax,\r\nson of Pausanias, king of Lacedaemon, and Nicias, son of Niceratus, the\r\nmost fortunate general of his time, each desired peace more ardently\r\nthan ever. Nicias, while still happy and honoured, wished to secure his\r\ngood fortune, to obtain a present release from trouble for himself and\r\nhis countrymen, and hand down to posterity a name as an ever-successful\r\nstatesman, and thought the way to do this was to keep out of danger and\r\ncommit himself as little as possible to fortune, and that peace alone\r\nmade this keeping out of danger possible. Pleistoanax, again, was\r\nassailed by his enemies for his restoration, and regularly held up by\r\nthem to the prejudice of his countrymen, upon every reverse that befell\r\nthem, as though his unjust restoration were the cause; the accusation\r\nbeing that he and his brother Aristocles had bribed the prophetess of\r\nDelphi to tell the Lacedaemonian deputations which successively arrived\r\nat the temple to bring home the seed of the demigod son of Zeus from\r\nabroad, else they would have to plough with a silver share. In this\r\nway, it was insisted, in time he had induced the Lacedaemonians in the\r\nnineteenth year of his exile to Lycaeum (whither he had gone when\r\nbanished on suspicion of having been bribed to retreat from Attica, and\r\nhad built half his house within the consecrated precinct of Zeus for\r\nfear of the Lacedaemonians), to restore him with the same dances and\r\nsacrifices with which they had instituted their kings upon the first\r\nsettlement of Lacedaemon. The smart of this accusation, and the\r\nreflection that in peace no disaster could occur, and that when\r\nLacedaemon had recovered her men there would be nothing for his enemies\r\nto take hold of (whereas, while war lasted, the highest station must\r\nalways bear the scandal of everything that went wrong), made him\r\nardently desire a settlement. Accordingly this winter was employed in\r\nconferences; and as spring rapidly approached, the Lacedaemonians sent\r\nround orders to the cities to prepare for a fortified occupation of\r\nAttica, and held this as a sword over the heads of the Athenians to\r\ninduce them to listen to their overtures; and at last, after many\r\nclaims had been urged on either side at the conferences a peace was\r\nagreed on upon the following basis. Each party was to restore its\r\nconquests, but Athens was to keep Nisaea; her demand for Plataea being\r\nmet by the Thebans asserting that they had acquired the place not by\r\nforce or treachery, but by the voluntary adhesion upon agreement of its\r\ncitizens; and the same, according to the Athenian account, being the\r\nhistory of her acquisition of Nisaea. This arranged, the Lacedaemonians\r\nsummoned their allies, and all voting for peace except the Boeotians,\r\nCorinthians, Eleans, and Megarians, who did not approve of these\r\nproceedings, they concluded the treaty and made peace, each of the\r\ncontracting parties swearing to the following articles:\r\n\r\nThe Athenians and Lacedaemonians and their allies made a treaty, and\r\nswore to it, city by city, as follows;\r\n\r\n1. Touching the national temples, there shall be a free passage by land\r\nand by sea to all who wish it, to sacrifice, travel, consult, and\r\nattend the oracle or games, according to the customs of their\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n2. The temple and shrine of Apollo at Delphi and the Delphians shall be\r\ngoverned by their own laws, taxed by their own state, and judged by\r\ntheir own judges, the land and the people, according to the custom of\r\ntheir country.\r\n\r\n3. The treaty shall be binding for fifty years upon the Athenians and\r\nthe allies of the Athenians, and upon the Lacedaemonians and the allies\r\nof the Lacedaemonians, without fraud or hurt by land or by sea.\r\n\r\n4. It shall not be lawful to take up arms, with intent to do hurt,\r\neither for the Lacedaemonians and their allies against the Athenians\r\nand their allies, or for the Athenians and their allies against the\r\nLacedaemonians and their allies, in any way or means whatsoever. But\r\nshould any difference arise between them they are to have recourse to\r\nlaw and oaths, according as may be agreed between the parties.\r\n\r\n5. The Lacedaemonians and their allies shall give back Amphipolis to\r\nthe Athenians. Nevertheless, in the case of cities given up by the\r\nLacedaemonians to the Athenians, the inhabitants shall be allowed to go\r\nwhere they please and to take their property with them: and the cities\r\nshall be independent, paying only the tribute of Aristides. And it\r\nshall not be lawful for the Athenians or their allies to carry on war\r\nagainst them after the treaty has been concluded, so long as the\r\ntribute is paid. The cities referred to are Argilus, Stagirus,\r\nAcanthus, Scolus, Olynthus, and Spartolus. These cities shall be\r\nneutral, allies neither of the Lacedaemonians nor of the Athenians: but\r\nif the cities consent, it shall be lawful for the Athenians to make\r\nthem their allies, provided always that the cities wish it. The\r\nMecybernaeans, Sanaeans, and Singaeans shall inhabit their own cities,\r\nas also the Olynthians and Acanthians: but the Lacedaemonians and their\r\nallies shall give back Panactum to the Athenians.\r\n\r\n6. The Athenians shall give back Coryphasium, Cythera, Methana,\r\nLacedaemonians that are in the prison at Athens or elsewhere in the\r\nAthenian dominions, and shall let go the Peloponnesians besieged in\r\nScione, and all others in Scione that are allies of the Lacedaemonians,\r\nand all whom Brasidas sent in there, and any others of the allies of\r\nthe Lacedaemonians that may be in the prison at Athens or elsewhere in\r\nthe Athenian dominions.\r\n\r\n7. The Lacedaemonians and their allies shall in like manner give back\r\nany of the Athenians or their allies that they may have in their hands.\r\n\r\n8. In the case of Scione, Torone, and Sermylium, and any other cities\r\nthat the Athenians may have, the Athenians may adopt such measures as\r\nthey please.\r\n\r\n9. The Athenians shall take an oath to the Lacedaemonians and their\r\nallies, city by city. Every man shall swear by the most binding oath of\r\nhis country, seventeen from each city. The oath shall be as follows; “I\r\nwill abide by this agreement and treaty honestly and without deceit.”\r\nIn the same way an oath shall be taken by the Lacedaemonians and their\r\nallies to the Athenians: and the oath shall be renewed annually by both\r\nparties. Pillars shall be erected at Olympia, Pythia, the Isthmus, at\r\nAthens in the Acropolis, and at Lacedaemon in the temple at Amyclae.\r\n\r\n10. If anything be forgotten, whatever it be, and on whatever point, it\r\nshall be consistent with their oath for both parties, the Athenians and\r\nLacedaemonians, to alter it, according to their discretion.\r\n\r\nThe treaty begins from the ephoralty of Pleistolas in Lacedaemon, on\r\nthe 27th day of the month of Artemisium, and from the archonship, of\r\nAlcaeus at Athens, on the 25th day of the month of Elaphebolion. Those\r\nwho took the oath and poured the libations for the Lacedaemonians were\r\nPleistoanax, Agis, Pleistolas, Damagetis, Chionis, Metagenes, Acanthus,\r\nDaithus, Ischagoras, Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antippus, Tellis,\r\nAlcinadas, Empedias, Menas, and Laphilus: for the Athenians, Lampon,\r\nIsthmonicus, Nicias, Laches, Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus, Hagnon,\r\nMyrtilus, Thrasycles, Theagenes, Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates,\r\nLeon, Lamachus, and Demosthenes.\r\n\r\nThis treaty was made in the spring, just at the end of winter, directly\r\nafter the city festival of Dionysus, just ten years, with the\r\ndifference of a few days, from the first invasion of Attica and the\r\ncommencement of this war. This must be calculated by the seasons rather\r\nthan by trusting to the enumeration of the names of the several\r\nmagistrates or offices of honour that are used to mark past events.\r\nAccuracy is impossible where an event may have occurred in the\r\nbeginning, or middle, or at any period in their tenure of office. But\r\nby computing by summers and winters, the method adopted in this\r\nhistory, it will be found that, each of these amounting to half a year,\r\nthere were ten summers and as many winters contained in this first war.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Lacedaemonians, to whose lot it fell to begin the work of\r\nrestitution, immediately set free all the prisoners of war in their\r\npossession, and sent Ischagoras, Menas, and Philocharidas as envoys to\r\nthe towns in the direction of Thrace, to order Clearidas to hand over\r\nAmphipolis to the Athenians, and the rest of their allies each to\r\naccept the treaty as it affected them. They, however, did not like its\r\nterms, and refused to accept it; Clearidas also, willing to oblige the\r\nChalcidians, would not hand over the town, averring his inability to do\r\nso against their will. Meanwhile he hastened in person to Lacedaemon\r\nwith envoys from the place, to defend his disobedience against the\r\npossible accusations of Ischagoras and his companions, and also to see\r\nwhether it was too late for the agreement to be altered; and on finding\r\nthe Lacedaemonians were bound, quickly set out back again with\r\ninstructions from them to hand over the place, if possible, or at all\r\nevents to bring out the Peloponnesians that were in it.\r\n\r\nThe allies happened to be present in person at Lacedaemon, and those\r\nwho had not accepted the treaty were now asked by the Lacedaemonians to\r\nadopt it. This, however, they refused to do, for the same reasons as\r\nbefore, unless a fairer one than the present were agreed upon; and\r\nremaining firm in their determination were dismissed by the\r\nLacedaemonians, who now decided on forming an alliance with the\r\nAthenians, thinking that Argos, who had refused the application of\r\nAmpelidas and Lichas for a renewal of the treaty, would without Athens\r\nbe no longer formidable, and that the rest of the Peloponnese would be\r\nmost likely to keep quiet, if the coveted alliance of Athens were shut\r\nagainst them. Accordingly, after conference with the Athenian\r\nambassadors, an alliance was agreed upon and oaths were exchanged, upon\r\nthe terms following:\r\n\r\n1. The Lacedaemonians shall be allies of the Athenians for fifty years.\r\n\r\n2. Should any enemy invade the territory of Lacedaemon and injure the\r\nLacedaemonians, the Athenians shall help in such way as they most\r\neffectively can, according to their power. But if the invader be gone\r\nafter plundering the country, that city shall be the enemy of\r\nLacedaemon and Athens, and shall be chastised by both, and one shall\r\nnot make peace without the other. This to be honestly, loyally, and\r\nwithout fraud.\r\n\r\n3. Should any enemy invade the territory of Athens and injure the\r\nAthenians, the Lacedaemonians shall help them in such way as they most\r\neffectively can, according to their power. But if the invader be gone\r\nafter plundering the country, that city shall be the enemy of\r\nLacedaemon and Athens, and shall be chastised by both, and one shall\r\nnot make peace without the other. This to be honestly, loyally, and\r\nwithout fraud.\r\n\r\n4. Should the slave population rise, the Athenians shall help the\r\nLacedaemonians with all their might, according to their power.\r\n\r\n5. This treaty shall be sworn to by the same persons on either side\r\nthat swore to the other. It shall be renewed annually by the\r\nLacedaemonians going to Athens for the Dionysia, and the Athenians to\r\nLacedaemon for the Hyacinthia, and a pillar shall be set up by either\r\nparty: at Lacedaemon near the statue of Apollo at Amyclae, and at\r\nAthens on the Acropolis near the statue of Athene. Should the\r\nLacedaemonians and Athenians see to add to or take away from the\r\nalliance in any particular, it shall be consistent with their oaths for\r\nboth parties to do so, according to their discretion.\r\n\r\nThose who took the oath for the Lacedaemonians were Pleistoanax, Agis,\r\nPleistolas, Damagetus, Chionis, Metagenes, Acanthus, Daithus,\r\nIschagoras, Philocharidas, Zeuxidas, Antippus, Alcinadas, Tellis,\r\nEmpedias, Menas, and Laphilus; for the Athenians, Lampon, Isthmionicus,\r\nLaches, Nicias, Euthydemus, Procles, Pythodorus, Hagnon, Myrtilus,\r\nThrasycles, Theagenes, Aristocrates, Iolcius, Timocrates, Leon,\r\nLamachus, and Demosthenes.\r\n\r\nThis alliance was made not long after the treaty; and the Athenians\r\ngave back the men from the island to the Lacedaemonians, and the summer\r\nof the eleventh year began. This completes the history of the first\r\nwar, which occupied the whole of the ten years previously.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI\r\n\r\n\r\nFeeling against Sparta in Peloponnese—League of the Mantineans, Eleans,\r\nArgives, and Athenians—Battle of Mantinea and breaking up of the League\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the treaty and the alliance between the Lacedaemonians and\r\nAthenians, concluded after the ten years’ war, in the ephorate of\r\nPleistolas at Lacedaemon, and the archonship of Alcaeus at Athens, the\r\nstates which had accepted them were at peace; but the Corinthians and\r\nsome of the cities in Peloponnese trying to disturb the settlement, a\r\nfresh agitation was instantly commenced by the allies against\r\nLacedaemon. Further, the Lacedaemonians, as time went on, became\r\nsuspected by the Athenians through their not performing some of the\r\nprovisions in the treaty; and though for six years and ten months they\r\nabstained from invasion of each other’s territory, yet abroad an\r\nunstable armistice did not prevent either party doing the other the\r\nmost effectual injury, until they were finally obliged to break the\r\ntreaty made after the ten years’ war and to have recourse to open\r\nhostilities.\r\n\r\nThe history of this period has been also written by the same\r\nThucydides, an Athenian, in the chronological order of events by\r\nsummers and winters, to the time when the Lacedaemonians and their\r\nallies put an end to the Athenian empire, and took the Long Walls and\r\nPiraeus. The war had then lasted for twenty-seven years in all. Only a\r\nmistaken judgment can object to including the interval of treaty in the\r\nwar. Looked at by the light of facts it cannot, it will be found, be\r\nrationally considered a state of peace, where neither party either gave\r\nor got back all that they had agreed, apart from the violations of it\r\nwhich occurred on both sides in the Mantinean and Epidaurian wars and\r\nother instances, and the fact that the allies in the direction of\r\nThrace were in as open hostility as ever, while the Boeotians had only\r\na truce renewed every ten days. So that the first ten years’ war, the\r\ntreacherous armistice that followed it, and the subsequent war will,\r\ncalculating by the seasons, be found to make up the number of years\r\nwhich I have mentioned, with the difference of a few days, and to\r\nafford an instance of faith in oracles being for once justified by the\r\nevent. I certainly all along remember from the beginning to the end of\r\nthe war its being commonly declared that it would last thrice nine\r\nyears. I lived through the whole of it, being of an age to comprehend\r\nevents, and giving my attention to them in order to know the exact\r\ntruth about them. It was also my fate to be an exile from my country\r\nfor twenty years after my command at Amphipolis; and being present with\r\nboth parties, and more especially with the Peloponnesians by reason of\r\nmy exile, I had leisure to observe affairs somewhat particularly. I\r\nwill accordingly now relate the differences that arose after the ten\r\nyears’ war, the breach of the treaty, and the hostilities that\r\nfollowed.\r\n\r\nAfter the conclusion of the fifty years’ truce and of the subsequent\r\nalliance, the embassies from Peloponnese which had been summoned for\r\nthis business returned from Lacedaemon. The rest went straight home,\r\nbut the Corinthians first turned aside to Argos and opened negotiations\r\nwith some of the men in office there, pointing out that Lacedaemon\r\ncould have no good end in view, but only the subjugation of\r\nPeloponnese, or she would never have entered into treaty and alliance\r\nwith the once detested Athenians, and that the duty of consulting for\r\nthe safety of Peloponnese had now fallen upon Argos, who should\r\nimmediately pass a decree inviting any Hellenic state that chose, such\r\nstate being independent and accustomed to meet fellow powers upon the\r\nfair and equal ground of law and justice, to make a defensive alliance\r\nwith the Argives; appointing a few individuals with plenipotentiary\r\npowers, instead of making the people the medium of negotiation, in\r\norder that, in the case of an applicant being rejected, the fact of his\r\novertures might not be made public. They said that many would come over\r\nfrom hatred of the Lacedaemonians. After this explanation of their\r\nviews, the Corinthians returned home.\r\n\r\nThe persons with whom they had communicated reported the proposal to\r\ntheir government and people, and the Argives passed the decree and\r\nchose twelve men to negotiate an alliance for any Hellenic state that\r\nwished it, except Athens and Lacedaemon, neither of which should be\r\nable to join without reference to the Argive people. Argos came into\r\nthe plan the more readily because she saw that war with Lacedaemon was\r\ninevitable, the truce being on the point of expiring; and also because\r\nshe hoped to gain the supremacy of Peloponnese. For at this time\r\nLacedaemon had sunk very low in public estimation because of her\r\ndisasters, while the Argives were in a most flourishing condition,\r\nhaving taken no part in the Attic war, but having on the contrary\r\nprofited largely by their neutrality. The Argives accordingly prepared\r\nto receive into alliance any of the Hellenes that desired it.\r\n\r\nThe Mantineans and their allies were the first to come over through\r\nfear of the Lacedaemonians. Having taken advantage of the war against\r\nAthens to reduce a large part of Arcadia into subjection, they thought\r\nthat Lacedaemon would not leave them undisturbed in their conquests,\r\nnow that she had leisure to interfere, and consequently gladly turned\r\nto a powerful city like Argos, the historical enemy of the\r\nLacedaemonians, and a sister democracy. Upon the defection of Mantinea,\r\nthe rest of Peloponnese at once began to agitate the propriety of\r\nfollowing her example, conceiving that the Mantineans not have changed\r\nsides without good reason; besides which they were angry with\r\nLacedaemon among other reasons for having inserted in the treaty with\r\nAthens that it should be consistent with their oaths for both parties,\r\nLacedaemonians and Athenians, to add to or take away from it according\r\nto their discretion. It was this clause that was the real origin of the\r\npanic in Peloponnese, by exciting suspicions of a Lacedaemonian and\r\nAthenian combination against their liberties: any alteration should\r\nproperly have been made conditional upon the consent of the whole body\r\nof the allies. With these apprehensions there was a very general desire\r\nin each state to place itself in alliance with Argos.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Lacedaemonians perceiving the agitation going on in\r\nPeloponnese, and that Corinth was the author of it and was herself\r\nabout to enter into alliance with the Argives, sent ambassadors thither\r\nin the hope of preventing what was in contemplation. They accused her\r\nof having brought it all about, and told her that she could not desert\r\nLacedaemon and become the ally of Argos, without adding violation of\r\nher oaths to the crime which she had already committed in not accepting\r\nthe treaty with Athens, when it had been expressly agreed that the\r\ndecision of the majority of the allies should be binding, unless the\r\ngods or heroes stood in the way. Corinth in her answer, delivered\r\nbefore those of her allies who had like her refused to accept the\r\ntreaty, and whom she had previously invited to attend, refrained from\r\nopenly stating the injuries she complained of, such as the non-recovery\r\nof Sollium or Anactorium from the Athenians, or any other point in\r\nwhich she thought she had been prejudiced, but took shelter under the\r\npretext that she could not give up her Thracian allies, to whom her\r\nseparate individual security had been given, when they first rebelled\r\nwith Potidæa, as well as upon subsequent occasions. She denied,\r\ntherefore, that she committed any violation of her oaths to the allies\r\nin not entering into the treaty with Athens; having sworn upon the\r\nfaith of the gods to her Thracian friends, she could not honestly give\r\nthem up. Besides, the expression was, “unless the gods or heroes stand\r\nin the way.” Now here, as it appeared to her, the gods stood in the\r\nway. This was what she said on the subject of her former oaths. As to\r\nthe Argive alliance, she would confer with her friends and do whatever\r\nwas right. The Lacedaemonian envoys returning home, some Argive\r\nambassadors who happened to be in Corinth pressed her to conclude the\r\nalliance without further delay, but were told to attend at the next\r\ncongress to be held at Corinth.\r\n\r\nImmediately afterwards an Elean embassy arrived, and first making an\r\nalliance with Corinth went on from thence to Argos, according to their\r\ninstructions, and became allies of the Argives, their country being\r\njust then at enmity with Lacedaemon and Lepreum. Some time back there\r\nhad been a war between the Lepreans and some of the Arcadians; and the\r\nEleans being called in by the former with the offer of half their\r\nlands, had put an end to the war, and leaving the land in the hands of\r\nits Leprean occupiers had imposed upon them the tribute of a talent to\r\nthe Olympian Zeus. Till the Attic war this tribute was paid by the\r\nLepreans, who then took the war as an excuse for no longer doing so,\r\nand upon the Eleans using force appealed to Lacedaemon. The case was\r\nthus submitted to her arbitrament; but the Eleans, suspecting the\r\nfairness of the tribunal, renounced the reference and laid waste the\r\nLeprean territory. The Lacedaemonians nevertheless decided that the\r\nLepreans were independent and the Eleans aggressors, and as the latter\r\ndid not abide by the arbitration, sent a garrison of heavy infantry\r\ninto Lepreum. Upon this the Eleans, holding that Lacedaemon had\r\nreceived one of their rebel subjects, put forward the convention\r\nproviding that each confederate should come out of the Attic war in\r\npossession of what he had when he went into it, and considering that\r\njustice had not been done them went over to the Argives, and now made\r\nthe alliance through their ambassadors, who had been instructed for\r\nthat purpose. Immediately after them the Corinthians and the Thracian\r\nChalcidians became allies of Argos. Meanwhile the Boeotians and\r\nMegarians, who acted together, remained quiet, being left to do as they\r\npleased by Lacedaemon, and thinking that the Argive democracy would not\r\nsuit so well with their aristocratic government as the Lacedaemonian\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time in this summer Athens succeeded in reducing Scione,\r\nput the adult males to death, and, making slaves of the women and\r\nchildren, gave the land for the Plataeans to live in. She also brought\r\nback the Delians to Delos, moved by her misfortunes in the field and by\r\nthe commands of the god at Delphi. Meanwhile the Phocians and Locrians\r\ncommenced hostilities. The Corinthians and Argives, being now in\r\nalliance, went to Tegea to bring about its defection from Lacedaemon,\r\nseeing that, if so considerable a state could be persuaded to join, all\r\nPeloponnese would be with them. But when the Tegeans said that they\r\nwould do nothing against Lacedaemon, the hitherto zealous Corinthians\r\nrelaxed their activity, and began to fear that none of the rest would\r\nnow come over. Still they went to the Boeotians and tried to persuade\r\nthem to alliance and a common action generally with Argos and\r\nthemselves, and also begged them to go with them to Athens and obtain\r\nfor them a ten days’ truce similar to that made between the Athenians\r\nand Boeotians not long after the fifty years’ treaty, and, in the event\r\nof the Athenians refusing, to throw up the armistice, and not make any\r\ntruce in future without Corinth. These were the requests of the\r\nCorinthians. The Boeotians stopped them on the subject of the Argive\r\nalliance, but went with them to Athens, where however they failed to\r\nobtain the ten days’ truce; the Athenian answer being that the\r\nCorinthians had truce already, as being allies of Lacedaemon.\r\nNevertheless the Boeotians did not throw up their ten days’ truce, in\r\nspite of the prayers and reproaches of the Corinthians for their breach\r\nof faith; and these last had to content themselves with a de facto\r\narmistice with Athens.\r\n\r\nThe same summer the Lacedaemonians marched into Arcadia with their\r\nwhole levy under Pleistoanax, son of Pausanias, king of Lacedaemon,\r\nagainst the Parrhasians, who were subjects of Mantinea, and a faction\r\nof whom had invited their aid. They also meant to demolish, if\r\npossible, the fort of Cypsela which the Mantineans had built and\r\ngarrisoned in the Parrhasian territory, to annoy the district of\r\nSciritis in Laconia. The Lacedaemonians accordingly laid waste the\r\nParrhasian country, and the Mantineans, placing their town in the hands\r\nof an Argive garrison, addressed themselves to the defence of their\r\nconfederacy, but being unable to save Cypsela or the Parrhasian towns\r\nwent back to Mantinea. Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians made the\r\nParrhasians independent, razed the fortress, and returned home.\r\n\r\nThe same summer the soldiers from Thrace who had gone out with Brasidas\r\ncame back, having been brought from thence after the treaty by\r\nClearidas; and the Lacedaemonians decreed that the Helots who had\r\nfought with Brasidas should be free and allowed to live where they\r\nliked, and not long afterwards settled them with the Neodamodes at\r\nLepreum, which is situated on the Laconian and Elean border; Lacedaemon\r\nbeing at this time at enmity with Elis. Those however of the Spartans\r\nwho had been taken prisoners on the island and had surrendered their\r\narms might, it was feared, suppose that they were to be subjected to\r\nsome degradation in consequence of their misfortune, and so make some\r\nattempt at revolution, if left in possession of their franchise. These\r\nwere therefore at once disfranchised, although some of them were in\r\noffice at the time, and thus placed under a disability to take office,\r\nor buy and sell anything. After some time, however, the franchise was\r\nrestored to them.\r\n\r\nThe same summer the Dians took Thyssus, a town on Acte by Athos in\r\nalliance with Athens. During the whole of this summer intercourse\r\nbetween the Athenians and Peloponnesians continued, although each party\r\nbegan to suspect the other directly after the treaty, because of the\r\nplaces specified in it not being restored. Lacedaemon, to whose lot it\r\nhad fallen to begin by restoring Amphipolis and the other towns, had\r\nnot done so. She had equally failed to get the treaty accepted by her\r\nThracian allies, or by the Boeotians or the Corinthians; although she\r\nwas continually promising to unite with Athens in compelling their\r\ncompliance, if it were longer refused. She also kept fixing a time at\r\nwhich those who still refused to come in were to be declared enemies to\r\nboth parties, but took care not to bind herself by any written\r\nagreement. Meanwhile the Athenians, seeing none of these professions\r\nperformed in fact, began to suspect the honesty of her intentions, and\r\nconsequently not only refused to comply with her demands for Pylos, but\r\nalso repented having given up the prisoners from the island, and kept\r\ntight hold of the other places, until Lacedaemon’s part of the treaty\r\nshould be fulfilled. Lacedaemon, on the other hand, said she had done\r\nwhat she could, having given up the Athenian prisoners of war in her\r\npossession, evacuated Thrace, and performed everything else in her\r\npower. Amphipolis it was out of her ability to restore; but she would\r\nendeavour to bring the Boeotians and Corinthians into the treaty, to\r\nrecover Panactum, and send home all the Athenian prisoners of war in\r\nBoeotia. Meanwhile she required that Pylos should be restored, or at\r\nall events that the Messenians and Helots should be withdrawn, as her\r\ntroops had been from Thrace, and the place garrisoned, if necessary, by\r\nthe Athenians themselves. After a number of different conferences held\r\nduring the summer, she succeeded in persuading Athens to withdraw from\r\nPylos the Messenians and the rest of the Helots and deserters from\r\nLaconia, who were accordingly settled by her at Cranii in Cephallenia.\r\nThus during this summer there was peace and intercourse between the two\r\npeoples.\r\n\r\nNext winter, however, the ephors under whom the treaty had been made\r\nwere no longer in office, and some of their successors were directly\r\nopposed to it. Embassies now arrived from the Lacedaemonian\r\nconfederacy, and the Athenians, Boeotians, and Corinthians also\r\npresented themselves at Lacedaemon, and after much discussion and no\r\nagreement between them, separated for their several homes; when\r\nCleobulus and Xenares, the two ephors who were the most anxious to\r\nbreak off the treaty, took advantage of this opportunity to communicate\r\nprivately with the Boeotians and Corinthians, and, advising them to act\r\nas much as possible together, instructed the former first to enter into\r\nalliance with Argos, and then try and bring themselves and the Argives\r\ninto alliance with Lacedaemon. The Boeotians would so be least likely\r\nto be compelled to come into the Attic treaty; and the Lacedaemonians\r\nwould prefer gaining the friendship and alliance of Argos even at the\r\nprice of the hostility of Athens and the rupture of the treaty. The\r\nBoeotians knew that an honourable friendship with Argos had been long\r\nthe desire of Lacedaemon; for the Lacedaemonians believed that this\r\nwould considerably facilitate the conduct of the war outside\r\nPeloponnese. Meanwhile they begged the Boeotians to place Panactum in\r\nher hands in order that she might, if possible, obtain Pylos in\r\nexchange for it, and so be more in a position to resume hostilities\r\nwith Athens.\r\n\r\nAfter receiving these instructions for their governments from Xenares\r\nand Cleobulus and their friends at Lacedaemon, the Boeotians and\r\nCorinthians departed. On their way home they were joined by two persons\r\nhigh in office at Argos, who had waited for them on the road, and who\r\nnow sounded them upon the possibility of the Boeotians joining the\r\nCorinthians, Eleans, and Mantineans in becoming the allies of Argos, in\r\nthe idea that if this could be effected they would be able, thus\r\nunited, to make peace or war as they pleased either against Lacedaemon\r\nor any other power. The Boeotian envoys were were pleased at thus\r\nhearing themselves accidentally asked to do what their friends at\r\nLacedaemon had told them; and the two Argives perceiving that their\r\nproposal was agreeable, departed with a promise to send ambassadors to\r\nthe Boeotians. On their arrival the Boeotians reported to the\r\nBoeotarchs what had been said to them at Lacedaemon and also by the\r\nArgives who had met them, and the Boeotarchs, pleased with the idea,\r\nembraced it with the more eagerness from the lucky coincidence of Argos\r\nsoliciting the very thing wanted by their friends at Lacedaemon.\r\nShortly afterwards ambassadors appeared from Argos with the proposals\r\nindicated; and the Boeotarchs approved of the terms and dismissed the\r\nambassadors with a promise to send envoys to Argos to negotiate the\r\nalliance.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime it was decided by the Boeotarchs, the Corinthians, the\r\nMegarians, and the envoys from Thrace first to interchange oaths\r\ntogether to give help to each other whenever it was required and not to\r\nmake war or peace except in common; after which the Boeotians and\r\nMegarians, who acted together, should make the alliance with Argos. But\r\nbefore the oaths were taken the Boeotarchs communicated these proposals\r\nto the four councils of the Boeotians, in whom the supreme power\r\nresides, and advised them to interchange oaths with all such cities as\r\nshould be willing to enter into a defensive league with the Boeotians.\r\nBut the members of the Boeotian councils refused their assent to the\r\nproposal, being afraid of offending Lacedaemon by entering into a\r\nleague with the deserter Corinth; the Boeotarchs not having acquainted\r\nthem with what had passed at Lacedaemon and with the advice given by\r\nCleobulus and Xenares and the Boeotian partisans there, namely, that\r\nthey should become allies of Corinth and Argos as a preliminary to a\r\njunction with Lacedaemon; fancying that, even if they should say\r\nnothing about this, the councils would not vote against what had been\r\ndecided and advised by the Boeotarchs. This difficulty arising, the\r\nCorinthians and the envoys from Thrace departed without anything having\r\nbeen concluded; and the Boeotarchs, who had previously intended after\r\ncarrying this to try and effect the alliance with Argos, now omitted to\r\nbring the Argive question before the councils, or to send to Argos the\r\nenvoys whom they had promised; and a general coldness and delay ensued\r\nin the matter.\r\n\r\nIn this same winter Mecyberna was assaulted and taken by the\r\nOlynthians, having an Athenian garrison inside it.\r\n\r\nAll this while negotiations had been going on between the Athenians and\r\nLacedaemonians about the conquests still retained by each, and\r\nLacedaemon, hoping that if Athens were to get back Panactum from the\r\nBoeotians she might herself recover Pylos, now sent an embassy to the\r\nBoeotians, and begged them to place Panactum and their Athenian\r\nprisoners in her hands, in order that she might exchange them for\r\nPylos. This the Boeotians refused to do, unless Lacedaemon made a\r\nseparate alliance with them as she had done with Athens. Lacedaemon\r\nknew that this would be a breach of faith to Athens, as it had been\r\nagreed that neither of them should make peace or war without the other;\r\nyet wishing to obtain Panactum which she hoped to exchange for Pylos,\r\nand the party who pressed for the dissolution of the treaty strongly\r\naffecting the Boeotian connection, she at length concluded the alliance\r\njust as winter gave way to spring; and Panactum was instantly razed.\r\nAnd so the eleventh year of the war ended.\r\n\r\nIn the first days of the summer following, the Argives, seeing that the\r\npromised ambassadors from Boeotia did not arrive, and that Panactum was\r\nbeing demolished, and that a separate alliance had been concluded\r\nbetween the Boeotians and Lacedaemonians, began to be afraid that Argos\r\nmight be left alone, and all the confederacy go over to Lacedaemon.\r\nThey fancied that the Boeotians had been persuaded by the\r\nLacedaemonians to raze Panactum and to enter into the treaty with the\r\nAthenians, and that Athens was privy to this arrangement, and even her\r\nalliance, therefore, no longer open to them—a resource which they had\r\nalways counted upon, by reason of the dissensions existing, in the\r\nevent of the noncontinuance of their treaty with Lacedaemon. In this\r\nstrait the Argives, afraid that, as the result of refusing to renew the\r\ntreaty with Lacedaemon and of aspiring to the supremacy in Peloponnese,\r\nthey would have the Lacedaemonians, Tegeans, Boeotians, and Athenians\r\non their hands all at once, now hastily sent off Eustrophus and Aeson,\r\nwho seemed the persons most likely to be acceptable, as envoys to\r\nLacedaemon, with the view of making as good a treaty as they could with\r\nthe Lacedaemonians, upon such terms as could be got, and being left in\r\npeace.\r\n\r\nHaving reached Lacedaemon, their ambassadors proceeded to negotiate the\r\nterms of the proposed treaty. What the Argives first demanded was that\r\nthey might be allowed to refer to the arbitration of some state or\r\nprivate person the question of the Cynurian land, a piece of frontier\r\nterritory about which they have always been disputing, and which\r\ncontains the towns of Thyrea and Anthene, and is occupied by the\r\nLacedaemonians. The Lacedaemonians at first said that they could not\r\nallow this point to be discussed, but were ready to conclude upon the\r\nold terms. Eventually, however, the Argive ambassadors succeeded in\r\nobtaining from them this concession: For the present there was to be a\r\ntruce for fifty years, but it should be competent for either party,\r\nthere being neither plague nor war in Lacedaemon or Argos, to give a\r\nformal challenge and decide the question of this territory by battle,\r\nas on a former occasion, when both sides claimed the victory; pursuit\r\nnot being allowed beyond the frontier of Argos or Lacedaemon. The\r\nLacedaemonians at first thought this mere folly; but at last, anxious\r\nat any cost to have the friendship of Argos they agreed to the terms\r\ndemanded, and reduced them to writing. However, before any of this\r\nshould become binding, the ambassadors were to return to Argos and\r\ncommunicate with their people and, in the event of their approval, to\r\ncome at the feast of the Hyacinthia and take the oaths.\r\n\r\nThe envoys returned accordingly. In the meantime, while the Argives\r\nwere engaged in these negotiations, the Lacedaemonian\r\nambassadors—Andromedes, Phaedimus, and Antimenidas—who were to receive\r\nthe prisoners from the Boeotians and restore them and Panactum to the\r\nAthenians, found that the Boeotians had themselves razed Panactum, upon\r\nthe plea that oaths had been anciently exchanged between their people\r\nand the Athenians, after a dispute on the subject to the effect that\r\nneither should inhabit the place, but that they should graze it in\r\ncommon. As for the Athenian prisoners of war in the hands of the\r\nBoeotians, these were delivered over to Andromedes and his colleagues,\r\nand by them conveyed to Athens and given back. The envoys at the same\r\ntime announced the razing of Panactum, which to them seemed as good as\r\nits restitution, as it would no longer lodge an enemy of Athens. This\r\nannouncement was received with great indignation by the Athenians, who\r\nthought that the Lacedaemonians had played them false, both in the\r\nmatter of the demolition of Panactum, which ought to have been restored\r\nto them standing, and in having, as they now heard, made a separate\r\nalliance with the Boeotians, in spite of their previous promise to join\r\nAthens in compelling the adhesion of those who refused to accede to the\r\ntreaty. The Athenians also considered the other points in which\r\nLacedaemon had failed in her compact, and thinking that they had been\r\noverreached, gave an angry answer to the ambassadors and sent them\r\naway.\r\n\r\nThe breach between the Lacedaemonians and Athenians having gone thus\r\nfar, the party at Athens, also, who wished to cancel the treaty,\r\nimmediately put themselves in motion. Foremost amongst these was\r\nAlcibiades, son of Clinias, a man yet young in years for any other\r\nHellenic city, but distinguished by the splendour of his ancestry.\r\nAlcibiades thought the Argive alliance really preferable, not that\r\npersonal pique had not also a great deal to do with his opposition; he\r\nbeing offended with the Lacedaemonians for having negotiated the treaty\r\nthrough Nicias and Laches, and having overlooked him on account of his\r\nyouth, and also for not having shown him the respect due to the ancient\r\nconnection of his family with them as their proxeni, which, renounced\r\nby his grandfather, he had lately himself thought to renew by his\r\nattentions to their prisoners taken in the island. Being thus, as he\r\nthought, slighted on all hands, he had in the first instance spoken\r\nagainst the treaty, saying that the Lacedaemonians were not to be\r\ntrusted, but that they only treated, in order to be enabled by this\r\nmeans to crush Argos, and afterwards to attack Athens alone; and now,\r\nimmediately upon the above occurring, he sent privately to the Argives,\r\ntelling them to come as quickly as possible to Athens, accompanied by\r\nthe Mantineans and Eleans, with proposals of alliance; as the moment\r\nwas propitious and he himself would do all he could to help them.\r\n\r\nUpon receiving this message and discovering that the Athenians, far\r\nfrom being privy to the Boeotian alliance, were involved in a serious\r\nquarrel with the Lacedaemonians, the Argives paid no further attention\r\nto the embassy which they had just sent to Lacedaemon on the subject of\r\nthe treaty, and began to incline rather towards the Athenians,\r\nreflecting that, in the event of war, they would thus have on their\r\nside a city that was not only an ancient ally of Argos, but a sister\r\ndemocracy and very powerful at sea. They accordingly at once sent\r\nambassadors to Athens to treat for an alliance, accompanied by others\r\nfrom Elis and Mantinea.\r\n\r\nAt the same time arrived in haste from Lacedaemon an embassy consisting\r\nof persons reputed well disposed towards the Athenians—Philocharidas,\r\nLeon, and Endius—for fear that the Athenians in their irritation might\r\nconclude alliance with the Argives, and also to ask back Pylos in\r\nexchange for Panactum, and in defence of the alliance with the\r\nBoeotians to plead that it had not been made to hurt the Athenians.\r\nUpon the envoys speaking in the senate upon these points, and stating\r\nthat they had come with full powers to settle all others at issue\r\nbetween them, Alcibiades became afraid that, if they were to repeat\r\nthese statements to the popular assembly, they might gain the\r\nmultitude, and the Argive alliance might be rejected, and accordingly\r\nhad recourse to the following stratagem. He persuaded the\r\nLacedaemonians by a solemn assurance that if they would say nothing of\r\ntheir full powers in the assembly, he would give back Pylos to them\r\n(himself, the present opponent of its restitution, engaging to obtain\r\nthis from the Athenians), and would settle the other points at issue.\r\nHis plan was to detach them from Nicias and to disgrace them before the\r\npeople, as being without sincerity in their intentions, or even common\r\nconsistency in their language, and so to get the Argives, Eleans, and\r\nMantineans taken into alliance. This plan proved successful. When the\r\nenvoys appeared before the people, and upon the question being put to\r\nthem, did not say as they had said in the senate, that they had come\r\nwith full powers, the Athenians lost all patience, and carried away by\r\nAlcibiades, who thundered more loudly than ever against the\r\nLacedaemonians, were ready instantly to introduce the Argives and their\r\ncompanions and to take them into alliance. An earthquake, however,\r\noccurring, before anything definite had been done, this assembly was\r\nadjourned.\r\n\r\nIn the assembly held the next day, Nicias, in spite of the\r\nLacedaemonians having been deceived themselves, and having allowed him\r\nto be deceived also in not admitting that they had come with full\r\npowers, still maintained that it was best to be friends with the\r\nLacedaemonians, and, letting the Argive proposals stand over, to send\r\nonce more to Lacedaemon and learn her intentions. The adjournment of\r\nthe war could only increase their own prestige and injure that of their\r\nrivals; the excellent state of their affairs making it their interest\r\nto preserve this prosperity as long as possible, while those of\r\nLacedaemon were so desperate that the sooner she could try her fortune\r\nagain the better. He succeeded accordingly in persuading them to send\r\nambassadors, himself being among the number, to invite the\r\nLacedaemonians, if they were really sincere, to restore Panactum intact\r\nwith Amphipolis, and to abandon their alliance with the Boeotians\r\n(unless they consented to accede to the treaty), agreeably to the\r\nstipulation which forbade either to treat without the other. The\r\nambassadors were also directed to say that the Athenians, had they\r\nwished to play false, might already have made alliance with the\r\nArgives, who were indeed come to Athens for that very purpose, and went\r\noff furnished with instructions as to any other complaints that the\r\nAthenians had to make. Having reached Lacedaemon, they communicated\r\ntheir instructions, and concluded by telling the Lacedaemonians that\r\nunless they gave up their alliance with the Boeotians, in the event of\r\ntheir not acceding to the treaty, the Athenians for their part would\r\nally themselves with the Argives and their friends. The Lacedaemonians,\r\nhowever, refused to give up the Boeotian alliance—the party of Xenares\r\nthe ephor, and such as shared their view, carrying the day upon this\r\npoint—but renewed the oaths at the request of Nicias, who feared to\r\nreturn without having accomplished anything and to be disgraced; as was\r\nindeed his fate, he being held the author of the treaty with\r\nLacedaemon. When he returned, and the Athenians heard that nothing had\r\nbeen done at Lacedaemon, they flew into a passion, and deciding that\r\nfaith had not been kept with them, took advantage of the presence of\r\nthe Argives and their allies, who had been introduced by Alcibiades,\r\nand made a treaty and alliance with them upon the terms following:\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans, acting for themselves\r\nand the allies in their respective empires, made a treaty for a hundred\r\nyears, to be without fraud or hurt by land and by sea.\r\n\r\n1. It shall not be lawful to carry on war, either for the Argives,\r\nEleans, Mantineans, and their allies, against the Athenians, or the\r\nallies in the Athenian empire: or for the Athenians and their allies\r\nagainst the Argives, Eleans, Mantineans, or their allies, in any way or\r\nmeans whatsoever.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, Argives, Eleans, and Mantineans shall be allies for a\r\nhundred years upon the terms following:\r\n\r\n2. If an enemy invade the country of the Athenians, the Argives,\r\nEleans, and Mantineans shall go to the relief of Athens, according as\r\nthe Athenians may require by message, in such way as they most\r\neffectually can, to the best of their power. But if the invader be gone\r\nafter plundering the territory, the offending state shall be the enemy\r\nof the Argives, Mantineans, Eleans, and Athenians, and war shall be\r\nmade against it by all these cities: and no one of the cities shall be\r\nable to make peace with that state, except all the above cities agree\r\nto do so.\r\n\r\n3. Likewise the Athenians shall go to the relief of Argos, Mantinea,\r\nand Elis, if an enemy invade the country of Elis, Mantinea, or Argos,\r\naccording as the above cities may require by message, in such way as\r\nthey most effectually can, to the best of their power. But if the\r\ninvader be gone after plundering the territory, the state offending\r\nshall be the enemy of the Athenians, Argives, Mantineans, and Eleans,\r\nand war shall be made against it by all these cities, and peace may not\r\nbe made with that state except all the above cities agree to it.\r\n\r\n4. No armed force shall be allowed to pass for hostile purposes through\r\nthe country of the powers contracting, or of the allies in their\r\nrespective empires, or to go by sea, except all the cities—that is to\r\nsay, Athens, Argos, Mantinea, and Elis—vote for such passage.\r\n\r\n5. The relieving troops shall be maintained by the city sending them\r\nfor thirty days from their arrival in the city that has required them,\r\nand upon their return in the same way: if their services be desired for\r\na longer period, the city that sent for them shall maintain them, at\r\nthe rate of three Aeginetan obols per day for a heavy-armed soldier,\r\narcher, or light soldier, and an Aeginetan drachma for a trooper.\r\n\r\n6. The city sending for the troops shall have the command when the war\r\nis in its own country: but in case of the cities resolving upon a joint\r\nexpedition the command shall be equally divided among all the cities.\r\n\r\n7. The treaty shall be sworn to by the Athenians for themselves and\r\ntheir allies, by the Argives, Mantineans, Eleans, and their allies, by\r\neach state individually. Each shall swear the oath most binding in his\r\ncountry over full-grown victims: the oath being as follows:\r\n\r\n“I STAND BY THE ALLIANCE AND ITS ARTICLES, JUSTLY, INNOCENTLY, AND\r\nSINCERELY, AND I WILL NOT TRANSGRESS THE SAME IN ANY WAY OR MEANS\r\nWHATSOEVER.”\r\n\r\nThe oath shall be taken at Athens by the Senate and the magistrates,\r\nthe Prytanes administering it: at Argos by the Senate, the Eighty, and\r\nthe Artynae, the Eighty administering it: at Mantinea by the Demiurgi,\r\nthe Senate, and the other magistrates, the Theori and Polemarchs\r\nadministering it: at Elis by the Demiurgi, the magistrates, and the Six\r\nHundred, the Demiurgi and the Thesmophylaces administering it. The\r\noaths shall be renewed by the Athenians going to Elis, Mantinea, and\r\nArgos thirty days before the Olympic games: by the Argives, Mantineans,\r\nand Eleans going to Athens ten days before the great feast of the\r\nPanathenaea. The articles of the treaty, the oaths, and the alliance\r\nshall be inscribed on a stone pillar by the Athenians in the citadel,\r\nby the Argives in the market-place, in the temple of Apollo: by the\r\nMantineans in the temple of Zeus, in the market-place: and a brazen\r\npillar shall be erected jointly by them at the Olympic games now at\r\nhand. Should the above cities see good to make any addition in these\r\narticles, whatever all the above cities shall agree upon, after\r\nconsulting together, shall be binding.\r\n\r\nAlthough the treaty and alliances were thus concluded, still the treaty\r\nbetween the Lacedaemonians and Athenians was not renounced by either\r\nparty. Meanwhile Corinth, although the ally of the Argives, did not\r\naccede to the new treaty, any more than she had done to the alliance,\r\ndefensive and offensive, formed before this between the Eleans,\r\nArgives, and Mantineans, when she declared herself content with the\r\nfirst alliance, which was defensive only, and which bound them to help\r\neach other, but not to join in attacking any. The Corinthians thus\r\nstood aloof from their allies, and again turned their thoughts towards\r\nLacedaemon.\r\n\r\nAt the Olympic games which were held this summer, and in which the\r\nArcadian Androsthenes was victor the first time in the wrestling and\r\nboxing, the Lacedaemonians were excluded from the temple by the Eleans,\r\nand thus prevented from sacrificing or contending, for having refused\r\nto pay the fine specified in the Olympic law imposed upon them by the\r\nEleans, who alleged that they had attacked Fort Phyrcus, and sent heavy\r\ninfantry of theirs into Lepreum during the Olympic truce. The amount of\r\nthe fine was two thousand minae, two for each heavy-armed soldier, as\r\nthe law prescribes. The Lacedaemonians sent envoys, and pleaded that\r\nthe imposition was unjust; saying that the truce had not yet been\r\nproclaimed at Lacedaemon when the heavy infantry were sent off. But the\r\nEleans affirmed that the armistice with them had already begun (they\r\nproclaim it first among themselves), and that the aggression of the\r\nLacedaemonians had taken them by surprise while they were living\r\nquietly as in time of peace, and not expecting anything. Upon this the\r\nLacedaemonians submitted, that if the Eleans really believed that they\r\nhad committed an aggression, it was useless after that to proclaim the\r\ntruce at Lacedaemon; but they had proclaimed it notwithstanding, as\r\nbelieving nothing of the kind, and from that moment the Lacedaemonians\r\nhad made no attack upon their country. Nevertheless the Eleans adhered\r\nto what they had said, that nothing would persuade them that an\r\naggression had not been committed; if, however, the Lacedaemonians\r\nwould restore Lepreum, they would give up their own share of the money\r\nand pay that of the god for them.\r\n\r\nAs this proposal was not accepted, the Eleans tried a second. Instead\r\nof restoring Lepreum, if this was objected to, the Lacedaemonians\r\nshould ascend the altar of the Olympian Zeus, as they were so anxious\r\nto have access to the temple, and swear before the Hellenes that they\r\nwould surely pay the fine at a later day. This being also refused, the\r\nLacedaemonians were excluded from the temple, the sacrifice, and the\r\ngames, and sacrificed at home; the Lepreans being the only other\r\nHellenes who did not attend. Still the Eleans were afraid of the\r\nLacedaemonians sacrificing by force, and kept guard with a heavy-armed\r\ncompany of their young men; being also joined by a thousand Argives,\r\nthe same number of Mantineans, and by some Athenian cavalry who stayed\r\nat Harpina during the feast. Great fears were felt in the assembly of\r\nthe Lacedaemonians coming in arms, especially after Lichas, son of\r\nArcesilaus, a Lacedaemonian, had been scourged on the course by the\r\numpires; because, upon his horses being the winners, and the Boeotian\r\npeople being proclaimed the victor on account of his having no right to\r\nenter, he came forward on the course and crowned the charioteer, in\r\norder to show that the chariot was his. After this incident all were\r\nmore afraid than ever, and firmly looked for a disturbance: the\r\nLacedaemonians, however, kept quiet, and let the feast pass by, as we\r\nhave seen. After the Olympic games, the Argives and the allies repaired\r\nto Corinth to invite her to come over to them. There they found some\r\nLacedaemonian envoys; and a long discussion ensued, which after all\r\nended in nothing, as an earthquake occurred, and they dispersed to\r\ntheir different homes.\r\n\r\nSummer was now over. The winter following a battle took place between\r\nthe Heracleots in Trachinia and the Aenianians, Dolopians, Malians, and\r\ncertain of the Thessalians, all tribes bordering on and hostile to the\r\ntown, which directly menaced their country. Accordingly, after having\r\nopposed and harassed it from its very foundation by every means in\r\ntheir power, they now in this battle defeated the Heracleots, Xenares,\r\nson of Cnidis, their Lacedaemonian commander, being among the slain.\r\nThus the winter ended and the twelfth year of this war ended also.\r\nAfter the battle, Heraclea was so terribly reduced that in the first\r\ndays of the summer following the Boeotians occupied the place and sent\r\naway the Lacedaemonian Agesippidas for misgovernment, fearing that the\r\ntown might be taken by the Athenians while the Lacedaemonians were\r\ndistracted with the affairs of Peloponnese. The Lacedaemonians,\r\nnevertheless, were offended with them for what they had done.\r\n\r\nThe same summer Alcibiades, son of Clinias, now one of the generals at\r\nAthens, in concert with the Argives and the allies, went into\r\nPeloponnese with a few Athenian heavy infantry and archers and some of\r\nthe allies in those parts whom he took up as he passed, and with this\r\narmy marched here and there through Peloponnese, and settled various\r\nmatters connected with the alliance, and among other things induced the\r\nPatrians to carry their walls down to the sea, intending himself also\r\nto build a fort near the Achaean Rhium. However, the Corinthians and\r\nSicyonians, and all others who would have suffered by its being built,\r\ncame up and hindered him.\r\n\r\nThe same summer war broke out between the Epidaurians and Argives. The\r\npretext was that the Epidaurians did not send an offering for their\r\npasture-land to Apollo Pythaeus, as they were bound to do, the Argives\r\nhaving the chief management of the temple; but, apart from this\r\npretext, Alcibiades and the Argives were determined, if possible, to\r\ngain possession of Epidaurus, and thus to ensure the neutrality of\r\nCorinth and give the Athenians a shorter passage for their\r\nreinforcements from Aegina than if they had to sail round Scyllaeum.\r\nThe Argives accordingly prepared to invade Epidaurus by themselves, to\r\nexact the offering.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Lacedaemonians marched out with all their\r\npeople to Leuctra upon their frontier, opposite to Mount Lycaeum, under\r\nthe command of Agis, son of Archidamus, without any one knowing their\r\ndestination, not even the cities that sent the contingents. The\r\nsacrifices, however, for crossing the frontier not proving propitious,\r\nthe Lacedaemonians returned home themselves, and sent word to the\r\nallies to be ready to march after the month ensuing, which happened to\r\nbe the month of Carneus, a holy time for the Dorians. Upon the retreat\r\nof the Lacedaemonians the Argives marched out on the last day but three\r\nof the month before Carneus, and keeping this as the day during the\r\nwhole time that they were out, invaded and plundered Epidaurus. The\r\nEpidaurians summoned their allies to their aid, some of whom pleaded\r\nthe month as an excuse; others came as far as the frontier of Epidaurus\r\nand there remained inactive.\r\n\r\nWhile the Argives were in Epidaurus embassies from the cities assembled\r\nat Mantinea, upon the invitation of the Athenians. The conference\r\nhaving begun, the Corinthian Euphamidas said that their actions did not\r\nagree with their words; while they were sitting deliberating about\r\npeace, the Epidaurians and their allies and the Argives were arrayed\r\nagainst each other in arms; deputies from each party should first go\r\nand separate the armies, and then the talk about peace might be\r\nresumed. In compliance with this suggestion, they went and brought back\r\nthe Argives from Epidaurus, and afterwards reassembled, but without\r\nsucceeding any better in coming to a conclusion; and the Argives a\r\nsecond time invaded Epidaurus and plundered the country. The\r\nLacedaemonians also marched out to Caryae; but the frontier sacrifices\r\nagain proving unfavourable, they went back again, and the Argives,\r\nafter ravaging about a third of the Epidaurian territory, returned\r\nhome. Meanwhile a thousand Athenian heavy infantry had come to their\r\naid under the command of Alcibiades, but finding that the Lacedaemonian\r\nexpedition was at an end, and that they were no longer wanted, went\r\nback again.\r\n\r\nSo passed the summer. The next winter the Lacedaemonians managed to\r\nelude the vigilance of the Athenians, and sent in a garrison of three\r\nhundred men to Epidaurus, under the command of Agesippidas. Upon this\r\nthe Argives went to the Athenians and complained of their having\r\nallowed an enemy to pass by sea, in spite of the clause in the treaty\r\nby which the allies were not to allow an enemy to pass through their\r\ncountry. Unless, therefore, they now put the Messenians and Helots in\r\nPylos to annoy the Lacedaemonians, they, the Argives, should consider\r\nthat faith had not been kept with them. The Athenians were persuaded by\r\nAlcibiades to inscribe at the bottom of the Laconian pillar that the\r\nLacedaemonians had not kept their oaths, and to convey the Helots at\r\nCranii to Pylos to plunder the country; but for the rest they remained\r\nquiet as before. During this winter hostilities went on between the\r\nArgives and Epidaurians, without any pitched battle taking place, but\r\nonly forays and ambuscades, in which the losses were small and fell now\r\non one side and now on the other. At the close of the winter, towards\r\nthe beginning of spring, the Argives went with scaling ladders to\r\nEpidaurus, expecting to find it left unguarded on account of the war\r\nand to be able to take it by assault, but returned unsuccessful. And\r\nthe winter ended, and with it the thirteenth year of the war ended\r\nalso.\r\n\r\nIn the middle of the next summer the Lacedaemonians, seeing the\r\nEpidaurians, their allies, in distress, and the rest of Peloponnese\r\neither in revolt or disaffected, concluded that it was high time for\r\nthem to interfere if they wished to stop the progress of the evil, and\r\naccordingly with their full force, the Helots included, took the field\r\nagainst Argos, under the command of Agis, son of Archidamus, king of\r\nthe Lacedaemonians. The Tegeans and the other Arcadian allies of\r\nLacedaemon joined in the expedition. The allies from the rest of\r\nPeloponnese and from outside mustered at Phlius; the Boeotians with\r\nfive thousand heavy infantry and as many light troops, and five hundred\r\nhorse and the same number of dismounted troopers; the Corinthians with\r\ntwo thousand heavy infantry; the rest more or less as might happen; and\r\nthe Phliasians with all their forces, the army being in their country.\r\n\r\nThe preparations of the Lacedaemonians from the first had been known to\r\nthe Argives, who did not, however, take the field until the enemy was\r\non his road to join the rest at Phlius. Reinforced by the Mantineans\r\nwith their allies, and by three thousand Elean heavy infantry, they\r\nadvanced and fell in with the Lacedaemonians at Methydrium in Arcadia.\r\nEach party took up its position upon a hill, and the Argives prepared\r\nto engage the Lacedaemonians while they were alone; but Agis eluded\r\nthem by breaking up his camp in the night, and proceeded to join the\r\nrest of the allies at Phlius. The Argives discovering this at daybreak,\r\nmarched first to Argos and then to the Nemean road, by which they\r\nexpected the Lacedaemonians and their allies would come down. However,\r\nAgis, instead of taking this road as they expected, gave the\r\nLacedaemonians, Arcadians, and Epidaurians their orders, and went along\r\nanother difficult road, and descended into the plain of Argos. The\r\nCorinthians, Pellenians, and Phliasians marched by another steep road;\r\nwhile the Boeotians, Megarians, and Sicyonians had instructions to come\r\ndown by the Nemean road where the Argives were posted, in order that,\r\nif the enemy advanced into the plain against the troops of Agis, they\r\nmight fall upon his rear with their cavalry. These dispositions\r\nconcluded, Agis invaded the plain and began to ravage Saminthus and\r\nother places.\r\n\r\nDiscovering this, the Argives came up from Nemea, day having now\r\ndawned. On their way they fell in with the troops of the Phliasians and\r\nCorinthians, and killed a few of the Phliasians and had perhaps a few\r\nmore of their own men killed by the Corinthians. Meanwhile the\r\nBoeotians, Megarians, and Sicyonians, advancing upon Nemea according to\r\ntheir instructions, found the Argives no longer there, as they had gone\r\ndown on seeing their property ravaged, and were now forming for battle,\r\nthe Lacedaemonians imitating their example. The Argives were now\r\ncompletely surrounded; from the plain the Lacedaemonians and their\r\nallies shut them off from their city; above them were the Corinthians,\r\nPhliasians, and Pellenians; and on the side of Nemea the Boeotians,\r\nSicyonians, and Megarians. Meanwhile their army was without cavalry,\r\nthe Athenians alone among the allies not having yet arrived. Now the\r\nbulk of the Argives and their allies did not see the danger of their\r\nposition, but thought that they could not have a fairer field, having\r\nintercepted the Lacedaemonians in their own country and close to the\r\ncity. Two men, however, in the Argive army, Thrasylus, one of the five\r\ngenerals, and Alciphron, the Lacedaemonian proxenus, just as the armies\r\nwere upon the point of engaging, went and held a parley with Agis and\r\nurged him not to bring on a battle, as the Argives were ready to refer\r\nto fair and equal arbitration whatever complaints the Lacedaemonians\r\nmight have against them, and to make a treaty and live in peace in\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\nThe Argives who made these statements did so upon their own authority,\r\nnot by order of the people, and Agis on his accepted their proposals,\r\nand without himself either consulting the majority, simply communicated\r\nthe matter to a single individual, one of the high officers\r\naccompanying the expedition, and granted the Argives a truce for four\r\nmonths, in which to fulfil their promises; after which he immediately\r\nled off the army without giving any explanation to any of the other\r\nallies. The Lacedaemonians and allies followed their general out of\r\nrespect for the law, but amongst themselves loudly blamed Agis for\r\ngoing away from so fair a field (the enemy being hemmed in on every\r\nside by infantry and cavalry) without having done anything worthy of\r\ntheir strength. Indeed this was by far the finest Hellenic army ever\r\nyet brought together; and it should have been seen while it was still\r\nunited at Nemea, with the Lacedaemonians in full force, the Arcadians,\r\nBoeotians, Corinthians, Sicyonians, Pellenians, Phliasians and\r\nMegarians, and all these the flower of their respective populations,\r\nthinking themselves a match not merely for the Argive confederacy, but\r\nfor another such added to it. The army thus retired blaming Agis, and\r\nreturned every man to his home. The Argives however blamed still more\r\nloudly the persons who had concluded the truce without consulting the\r\npeople, themselves thinking that they had let escape with the\r\nLacedaemonians an opportunity such as they should never see again; as\r\nthe struggle would have been under the walls of their city, and by the\r\nside of many and brave allies. On their return accordingly they began\r\nto stone Thrasylus in the bed of the Charadrus, where they try all\r\nmilitary causes before entering the city. Thrasylus fled to the altar,\r\nand so saved his life; his property however they confiscated.\r\n\r\nAfter this arrived a thousand Athenian heavy infantry and three hundred\r\nhorse, under the command of Laches and Nicostratus; whom the Argives,\r\nbeing nevertheless loath to break the truce with the Lacedaemonians,\r\nbegged to depart, and refused to bring before the people, to whom they\r\nhad a communication to make, until compelled to do so by the entreaties\r\nof the Mantineans and Eleans, who were still at Argos. The Athenians,\r\nby the mouth of Alcibiades their ambassador there present, told the\r\nArgives and the allies that they had no right to make a truce at all\r\nwithout the consent of their fellow confederates, and now that the\r\nAthenians had arrived so opportunely the war ought to be resumed. These\r\narguments proving successful with the allies, they immediately marched\r\nupon Orchomenos, all except the Argives, who, although they had\r\nconsented like the rest, stayed behind at first, but eventually joined\r\nthe others. They now all sat down and besieged Orchomenos, and made\r\nassaults upon it; one of their reasons for desiring to gain this place\r\nbeing that hostages from Arcadia had been lodged there by the\r\nLacedaemonians. The Orchomenians, alarmed at the weakness of their wall\r\nand the numbers of the enemy, and at the risk they ran of perishing\r\nbefore relief arrived, capitulated upon condition of joining the\r\nleague, of giving hostages of their own to the Mantineans, and giving\r\nup those lodged with them by the Lacedaemonians. Orchomenos thus\r\nsecured, the allies now consulted as to which of the remaining places\r\nthey should attack next. The Eleans were urgent for Lepreum; the\r\nMantineans for Tegea; and the Argives and Athenians giving their\r\nsupport to the Mantineans, the Eleans went home in a rage at their not\r\nhaving voted for Lepreum; while the rest of the allies made ready at\r\nMantinea for going against Tegea, which a party inside had arranged to\r\nput into their hands.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Lacedaemonians, upon their return from Argos after\r\nconcluding the four months’ truce, vehemently blamed Agis for not\r\nhaving subdued Argos, after an opportunity such as they thought they\r\nhad never had before; for it was no easy matter to bring so many and so\r\ngood allies together. But when the news arrived of the capture of\r\nOrchomenos, they became more angry than ever, and, departing from all\r\nprecedent, in the heat of the moment had almost decided to raze his\r\nhouse, and to fine him ten thousand drachmae. Agis however entreated\r\nthem to do none of these things, promising to atone for his fault by\r\ngood service in the field, failing which they might then do to him\r\nwhatever they pleased; and they accordingly abstained from razing his\r\nhouse or fining him as they had threatened to do, and now made a law,\r\nhitherto unknown at Lacedaemon, attaching to him ten Spartans as\r\ncounsellors, without whose consent he should have no power to lead an\r\narmy out of the city.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture arrived word from their friends in Tegea that, unless\r\nthey speedily appeared, Tegea would go over from them to the Argives\r\nand their allies, if it had not gone over already. Upon this news a\r\nforce marched out from Lacedaemon, of the Spartans and Helots and all\r\ntheir people, and that instantly and upon a scale never before\r\nwitnessed. Advancing to Orestheum in Maenalia, they directed the\r\nArcadians in their league to follow close after them to Tegea, and,\r\ngoing on themselves as far as Orestheum, from thence sent back the\r\nsixth part of the Spartans, consisting of the oldest and youngest men,\r\nto guard their homes, and with the rest of their army arrived at Tegea;\r\nwhere their Arcadian allies soon after joined them. Meanwhile they sent\r\nto Corinth, to the Boeotians, the Phocians, and Locrians, with orders\r\nto come up as quickly as possible to Mantinea. These had but short\r\nnotice; and it was not easy except all together, and after waiting for\r\neach other, to pass through the enemy’s country, which lay right across\r\nand blocked up the line of communication. Nevertheless they made what\r\nhaste they could. Meanwhile the Lacedaemonians with the Arcadian allies\r\nthat had joined them, entered the territory of Mantinea, and encamping\r\nnear the temple of Heracles began to plunder the country.\r\n\r\nHere they were seen by the Argives and their allies, who immediately\r\ntook up a strong and difficult position, and formed in order of battle.\r\nThe Lacedaemonians at once advanced against them, and came on within a\r\nstone’s throw or javelin’s cast, when one of the older men, seeing the\r\nenemy’s position to be a strong one, hallooed to Agis that he was\r\nminded to cure one evil with another; meaning that he wished to make\r\namends for his retreat, which had been so much blamed, from Argos, by\r\nhis present untimely precipitation. Meanwhile Agis, whether in\r\nconsequence of this halloo or of some sudden new idea of his own,\r\nquickly led back his army without engaging, and entering the Tegean\r\nterritory, began to turn off into that of Mantinea the water about\r\nwhich the Mantineans and Tegeans are always fighting, on account of the\r\nextensive damage it does to whichever of the two countries it falls\r\ninto. His object in this was to make the Argives and their allies come\r\ndown from the hill, to resist the diversion of the water, as they would\r\nbe sure to do when they knew of it, and thus to fight the battle in the\r\nplain. He accordingly stayed that day where he was, engaged in turning\r\noff the water. The Argives and their allies were at first amazed at the\r\nsudden retreat of the enemy after advancing so near, and did not know\r\nwhat to make of it; but when he had gone away and disappeared, without\r\ntheir having stirred to pursue him, they began anew to find fault with\r\ntheir generals, who had not only let the Lacedaemonians get off before,\r\nwhen they were so happily intercepted before Argos, but who now again\r\nallowed them to run away, without any one pursuing them, and to escape\r\nat their leisure while the Argive army was leisurely betrayed. The\r\ngenerals, half-stunned for the moment, afterwards led them down from\r\nthe hill, and went forward and encamped in the plain, with the\r\nintention of attacking the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Argives and their allies formed in the order in which\r\nthey meant to fight, if they chanced to encounter the enemy; and the\r\nLacedaemonians returning from the water to their old encampment by the\r\ntemple of Heracles, suddenly saw their adversaries close in front of\r\nthem, all in complete order, and advanced from the hill. A shock like\r\nthat of the present moment the Lacedaemonians do not ever remember to\r\nhave experienced: there was scant time for preparation, as they\r\ninstantly and hastily fell into their ranks, Agis, their king,\r\ndirecting everything, agreeably to the law. For when a king is in the\r\nfield all commands proceed from him: he gives the word to the\r\nPolemarchs; they to the Lochages; these to the Pentecostyes; these\r\nagain to the Enomotarchs, and these last to the Enomoties. In short all\r\norders required pass in the same way and quickly reach the troops; as\r\nalmost the whole Lacedaemonian army, save for a small part, consists of\r\nofficers under officers, and the care of what is to be done falls upon\r\nmany.\r\n\r\nIn this battle the left wing was composed of the Sciritae, who in a\r\nLacedaemonian army have always that post to themselves alone; next to\r\nthese were the soldiers of Brasidas from Thrace, and the Neodamodes\r\nwith them; then came the Lacedaemonians themselves, company after\r\ncompany, with the Arcadians of Heraea at their side. After these were\r\nthe Maenalians, and on the right wing the Tegeans with a few of the\r\nLacedaemonians at the extremity; their cavalry being posted upon the\r\ntwo wings. Such was the Lacedaemonian formation. That of their\r\nopponents was as follows: On the right were the Mantineans, the action\r\ntaking place in their country; next to them the allies from Arcadia;\r\nafter whom came the thousand picked men of the Argives, to whom the\r\nstate had given a long course of military training at the public\r\nexpense; next to them the rest of the Argives, and after them their\r\nallies, the Cleonaeans and Orneans, and lastly the Athenians on the\r\nextreme left, and lastly the Athenians on the extreme left, and their\r\nown cavalry with them.\r\n\r\nSuch were the order and the forces of the two combatants. The\r\nLacedaemonian army looked the largest; though as to putting down the\r\nnumbers of either host, or of the contingents composing it, I could not\r\ndo so with any accuracy. Owing to the secrecy of their government the\r\nnumber of the Lacedaemonians was not known, and men are so apt to brag\r\nabout the forces of their country that the estimate of their opponents\r\nwas not trusted. The following calculation, however, makes it possible\r\nto estimate the numbers of the Lacedaemonians present upon this\r\noccasion. There were seven companies in the field without counting the\r\nSciritae, who numbered six hundred men: in each company there were four\r\nPentecostyes, and in the Pentecosty four Enomoties. The first rank of\r\nthe Enomoty was composed of four soldiers: as to the depth, although\r\nthey had not been all drawn up alike, but as each captain chose, they\r\nwere generally ranged eight deep; the first rank along the whole line,\r\nexclusive of the Sciritae, consisted of four hundred and forty-eight\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nThe armies being now on the eve of engaging, each contingent received\r\nsome words of encouragement from its own commander. The Mantineans\r\nwere, reminded that they were going to fight for their country and to\r\navoid returning to the experience of servitude after having tasted that\r\nof empire; the Argives, that they would contend for their ancient\r\nsupremacy, to regain their once equal share of Peloponnese of which\r\nthey had been so long deprived, and to punish an enemy and a neighbour\r\nfor a thousand wrongs; the Athenians, of the glory of gaining the\r\nhonours of the day with so many and brave allies in arms, and that a\r\nvictory over the Lacedaemonians in Peloponnese would cement and extend\r\ntheir empire, and would besides preserve Attica from all invasions in\r\nfuture. These were the incitements addressed to the Argives and their\r\nallies. The Lacedaemonians meanwhile, man to man, and with their\r\nwar-songs in the ranks, exhorted each brave comrade to remember what he\r\nhad learnt before; well aware that the long training of action was of\r\nmore saving virtue than any brief verbal exhortation, though never so\r\nwell delivered.\r\n\r\nAfter this they joined battle, the Argives and their allies advancing\r\nwith haste and fury, the Lacedaemonians slowly and to the music of many\r\nflute-players—a standing institution in their army, that has nothing to\r\ndo with religion, but is meant to make them advance evenly, stepping in\r\ntime, without break their order, as large armies are apt to do in the\r\nmoment of engaging.\r\n\r\nJust before the battle joined, King Agis resolved upon the following\r\nmanoeuvre. All armies are alike in this: on going into action they get\r\nforced out rather on their right wing, and one and the other overlap\r\nwith this adversary’s left; because fear makes each man do his best to\r\nshelter his unarmed side with the shield of the man next him on the\r\nright, thinking that the closer the shields are locked together the\r\nbetter will he be protected. The man primarily responsible for this is\r\nthe first upon the right wing, who is always striving to withdraw from\r\nthe enemy his unarmed side; and the same apprehension makes the rest\r\nfollow him. On the present occasion the Mantineans reached with their\r\nwing far beyond the Sciritae, and the Lacedaemonians and Tegeans still\r\nfarther beyond the Athenians, as their army was the largest. Agis,\r\nafraid of his left being surrounded, and thinking that the Mantineans\r\noutflanked it too far, ordered the Sciritae and Brasideans to move out\r\nfrom their place in the ranks and make the line even with the\r\nMantineans, and told the Polemarchs Hipponoidas and Aristocles to fill\r\nup the gap thus formed, by throwing themselves into it with two\r\ncompanies taken from the right wing; thinking that his right would\r\nstill be strong enough and to spare, and that the line fronting the\r\nMantineans would gain in solidity.\r\n\r\nHowever, as he gave these orders in the moment of the onset, and at\r\nshort notice, it so happened that Aristocles and Hipponoidas would not\r\nmove over, for which offence they were afterwards banished from Sparta,\r\nas having been guilty of cowardice; and the enemy meanwhile closed\r\nbefore the Sciritae (whom Agis on seeing that the two companies did not\r\nmove over ordered to return to their place) had time to fill up the\r\nbreach in question. Now it was, however, that the Lacedaemonians,\r\nutterly worsted in respect of skill, showed themselves as superior in\r\npoint of courage. As soon as they came to close quarters with the\r\nenemy, the Mantinean right broke their Sciritae and Brasideans, and,\r\nbursting in with their allies and the thousand picked Argives into the\r\nunclosed breach in their line, cut up and surrounded the\r\nLacedaemonians, and drove them in full rout to the wagons, slaying some\r\nof the older men on guard there. But the Lacedaemonians, worsted in\r\nthis part of the field, with the rest of their army, and especially the\r\ncentre, where the three hundred knights, as they are called, fought\r\nround King Agis, fell on the older men of the Argives and the five\r\ncompanies so named, and on the Cleonaeans, the Orneans, and the\r\nAthenians next them, and instantly routed them; the greater number not\r\neven waiting to strike a blow, but giving way the moment that they came\r\non, some even being trodden under foot, in their fear of being\r\novertaken by their assailants.\r\n\r\nThe army of the Argives and their allies, having given way in this\r\nquarter, was now completely cut in two, and the Lacedaemonian and\r\nTegean right simultaneously closing round the Athenians with the troops\r\nthat outflanked them, these last found themselves placed between two\r\nfires, being surrounded on one side and already defeated on the other.\r\nIndeed they would have suffered more severely than any other part of\r\nthe army, but for the services of the cavalry which they had with them.\r\nAgis also on perceiving the distress of his left opposed to the\r\nMantineans and the thousand Argives, ordered all the army to advance to\r\nthe support of the defeated wing; and while this took place, as the\r\nenemy moved past and slanted away from them, the Athenians escaped at\r\ntheir leisure, and with them the beaten Argive division. Meanwhile the\r\nMantineans and their allies and the picked body of the Argives ceased\r\nto press the enemy, and seeing their friends defeated and the\r\nLacedaemonians in full advance upon them, took to flight. Many of the\r\nMantineans perished; but the bulk of the picked body of the Argives\r\nmade good their escape. The flight and retreat, however, were neither\r\nhurried nor long; the Lacedaemonians fighting long and stubbornly until\r\nthe rout of their enemy, but that once effected, pursuing for a short\r\ntime and not far.\r\n\r\nSuch was the battle, as nearly as possible as I have described it; the\r\ngreatest that had occurred for a very long while among the Hellenes,\r\nand joined by the most considerable states. The Lacedaemonians took up\r\na position in front of the enemy’s dead, and immediately set up a\r\ntrophy and stripped the slain; they took up their own dead and carried\r\nthem back to Tegea, where they buried them, and restored those of the\r\nenemy under truce. The Argives, Orneans, and Cleonaeans had seven\r\nhundred killed; the Mantineans two hundred, and the Athenians and\r\nAeginetans also two hundred, with both their generals. On the side of\r\nthe Lacedaemonians, the allies did not suffer any loss worth speaking\r\nof: as to the Lacedaemonians themselves it was difficult to learn the\r\ntruth; it is said, however, that there were slain about three hundred\r\nof them.\r\n\r\nWhile the battle was impending, Pleistoanax, the other king, set out\r\nwith a reinforcement composed of the oldest and youngest men, and got\r\nas far as Tegea, where he heard of the victory and went back again. The\r\nLacedaemonians also sent and turned back the allies from Corinth and\r\nfrom beyond the Isthmus, and returning themselves dismissed their\r\nallies, and kept the Carnean holidays, which happened to be at that\r\ntime. The imputations cast upon them by the Hellenes at the time,\r\nwhether of cowardice on account of the disaster in the island, or of\r\nmismanagement and slowness generally, were all wiped out by this single\r\naction: fortune, it was thought, might have humbled them, but the men\r\nthemselves were the same as ever.\r\n\r\nThe day before this battle, the Epidaurians with all their forces\r\ninvaded the deserted Argive territory, and cut off many of the guards\r\nleft there in the absence of the Argive army. After the battle three\r\nthousand Elean heavy infantry arriving to aid the Mantineans, and a\r\nreinforcement of one thousand Athenians, all these allies marched at\r\nonce against Epidaurus, while the Lacedaemonians were keeping the\r\nCarnea, and dividing the work among them began to build a wall round\r\nthe city. The rest left off; but the Athenians finished at once the\r\npart assigned to them round Cape Heraeum; and having all joined in\r\nleaving a garrison in the fortification in question, they returned to\r\ntheir respective cities.\r\n\r\nSummer now came to an end. In the first days of the next winter, when\r\nthe Carnean holidays were over, the Lacedaemonians took the field, and\r\narriving at Tegea sent on to Argos proposals of accommodation. They had\r\nbefore had a party in the town desirous of overthrowing the democracy;\r\nand after the battle that had been fought, these were now far more in a\r\nposition to persuade the people to listen to terms. Their plan was\r\nfirst to make a treaty with the Lacedaemonians, to be followed by an\r\nalliance, and after this to fall upon the commons. Lichas, son of\r\nArcesilaus, the Argive proxenus, accordingly arrived at Argos with two\r\nproposals from Lacedaemon, to regulate the conditions of war or peace,\r\naccording as they preferred the one or the other. After much\r\ndiscussion, Alcibiades happening to be in the town, the Lacedaemonian\r\nparty, who now ventured to act openly, persuaded the Argives to accept\r\nthe proposal for accommodation; which ran as follows:\r\n\r\nThe assembly of the Lacedaemonians agrees to treat with the Argives\r\nupon the terms following:\r\n\r\n1. The Argives shall restore to the Orchomenians their children, and to\r\nthe Maenalians their men, and shall restore the men they have in\r\nMantinea to the Lacedaemonians.\r\n\r\n2. They shall evacuate Epidaurus, and raze the fortification there. If\r\nthe Athenians refuse to withdraw from Epidaurus, they shall be declared\r\nenemies of the Argives and of the Lacedaemonians, and of the allies of\r\nthe Lacedaemonians and the allies of the Argives.\r\n\r\n3. If the Lacedaemonians have any children in their custody, they shall\r\nrestore them every one to his city.\r\n\r\n4. As to the offering to the god, the Argives, if they wish, shall\r\nimpose an oath upon the Epidaurians, but, if not, they shall swear it\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n5. All the cities in Peloponnese, both small and great, shall be\r\nindependent according to the customs of their country.\r\n\r\n6. If any of the powers outside Peloponnese invade Peloponnesian\r\nterritory, the parties contracting shall unite to repel them, on such\r\nterms as they may agree upon, as being most fair for the\r\nPeloponnesians.\r\n\r\n7. All allies of the Lacedaemonians outside Peloponnese shall be on the\r\nsame footing as the Lacedaemonians, and the allies of the Argives shall\r\nbe on the same footing as the Argives, being left in enjoyment of their\r\nown possessions.\r\n\r\n8. This treaty shall be shown to the allies, and shall be concluded, if\r\nthey approve; if the allies think fit, they may send the treaty to be\r\nconsidered at home.\r\n\r\nThe Argives began by accepting this proposal, and the Lacedaemonian\r\narmy returned home from Tegea. After this intercourse was renewed\r\nbetween them, and not long afterwards the same party contrived that the\r\nArgives should give up the league with the Mantineans, Eleans, and\r\nAthenians, and should make a treaty and alliance with the\r\nLacedaemonians; which was consequently done upon the terms following:\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians and Argives agree to a treaty and alliance for fifty\r\nyears upon the terms following:\r\n\r\n1. All disputes shall be decided by fair and impartial arbitration,\r\nagreeably to the customs of the two countries.\r\n\r\n2. The rest of the cities in Peloponnese may be included in this treaty\r\nand alliance, as independent and sovereign, in full enjoyment of what\r\nthey possess, all disputes being decided by fair and impartial\r\narbitration, agreeably to the customs of the said cities.\r\n\r\n3. All allies of the Lacedaemonians outside Peloponnese shall be upon\r\nthe same footing as the Lacedaemonians themselves, and the allies of\r\nthe Argives shall be upon the same footing as the Argives themselves,\r\ncontinuing to enjoy what they possess.\r\n\r\n4. If it shall be anywhere necessary to make an expedition in common,\r\nthe Lacedaemonians and Argives shall consult upon it and decide, as may\r\nbe most fair for the allies.\r\n\r\n5. If any of the cities, whether inside or outside Peloponnese, have a\r\nquestion whether of frontiers or otherwise, it must be settled, but if\r\none allied city should have a quarrel with another allied city, it must\r\nbe referred to some third city thought impartial by both parties.\r\nPrivate citizens shall have their disputes decided according to the\r\nlaws of their several countries.\r\n\r\nThe treaty and above alliance concluded, each party at once released\r\neverything whether acquired by war or otherwise, and thenceforth acting\r\nin common voted to receive neither herald nor embassy from the\r\nAthenians unless they evacuated their forts and withdrew from\r\nPeloponnese, and also to make neither peace nor war with any, except\r\njointly. Zeal was not wanting: both parties sent envoys to the Thracian\r\nplaces and to Perdiccas, and persuaded the latter to join their league.\r\nStill he did not at once break off from Athens, although minded to do\r\nso upon seeing the way shown him by Argos, the original home of his\r\nfamily. They also renewed their old oaths with the Chalcidians and took\r\nnew ones: the Argives, besides, sent ambassadors to the Athenians,\r\nbidding them evacuate the fort at Epidaurus. The Athenians, seeing\r\ntheir own men outnumbered by the rest of the garrison, sent Demosthenes\r\nto bring them out. This general, under colour of a gymnastic contest\r\nwhich he arranged on his arrival, got the rest of the garrison out of\r\nthe place, and shut the gates behind them. Afterwards the Athenians\r\nrenewed their treaty with the Epidaurians, and by themselves gave up\r\nthe fortress.\r\n\r\nAfter the defection of Argos from the league, the Mantineans, though\r\nthey held out at first, in the end finding themselves powerless without\r\nthe Argives, themselves too came to terms with Lacedaemon, and gave up\r\ntheir sovereignty over the towns. The Lacedaemonians and Argives, each\r\na thousand strong, now took the field together, and the former first\r\nwent by themselves to Sicyon and made the government there more\r\noligarchical than before, and then both, uniting, put down the\r\ndemocracy at Argos and set up an oligarchy favourable to Lacedaemon.\r\nThese events occurred at the close of the winter, just before spring;\r\nand the fourteenth year of the war ended. The next summer the people of\r\nDium, in Athos, revolted from the Athenians to the Chalcidians, and the\r\nLacedaemonians settled affairs in Achaea in a way more agreeable to the\r\ninterests of their country. Meanwhile the popular party at Argos little\r\nby little gathered new consistency and courage, and waited for the\r\nmoment of the Gymnopaedic festival at Lacedaemon, and then fell upon\r\nthe oligarchs. After a fight in the city, victory declared for the\r\ncommons, who slew some of their opponents and banished others. The\r\nLacedaemonians for a long while let the messages of their friends at\r\nArgos remain without effect. At last they put off the Gymnopaediae and\r\nmarched to their succour, but learning at Tegea the defeat of the\r\noligarchs, refused to go any further in spite of the entreaties of\r\nthose who had escaped, and returned home and kept the festival. Later\r\non, envoys arrived with messages from the Argives in the town and from\r\nthe exiles, when the allies were also at Sparta; and after much had\r\nbeen said on both sides, the Lacedaemonians decided that the party in\r\nthe town had done wrong, and resolved to march against Argos, but kept\r\ndelaying and putting off the matter. Meanwhile the commons at Argos, in\r\nfear of the Lacedaemonians, began again to court the Athenian alliance,\r\nwhich they were convinced would be of the greatest service to them; and\r\naccordingly proceeded to build long walls to the sea, in order that in\r\ncase of a blockade by land; with the help of the Athenians they might\r\nhave the advantage of importing what they wanted by sea. Some of the\r\ncities in Peloponnese were also privy to the building of these walls;\r\nand the Argives with all their people, women and slaves not excepted,\r\naddressed themselves to the work, while carpenters and masons came to\r\nthem from Athens.\r\n\r\nSummer was now over. The winter following the Lacedaemonians, hearing\r\nof the walls that were building, marched against Argos with their\r\nallies, the Corinthians excepted, being also not without intelligence\r\nin the city itself; Agis, son of Archidamus, their king, was in\r\ncommand. The intelligence which they counted upon within the town came\r\nto nothing; they however took and razed the walls which were being\r\nbuilt, and after capturing the Argive town Hysiae and killing all the\r\nfreemen that fell into their hands, went back and dispersed every man\r\nto his city. After this the Argives marched into Phlius and plundered\r\nit for harbouring their exiles, most of whom had settled there, and so\r\nreturned home. The same winter the Athenians blockaded Macedonia, on\r\nthe score of the league entered into by Perdiccas with the Argives and\r\nLacedaemonians, and also of his breach of his engagements on the\r\noccasion of the expedition prepared by Athens against the Chalcidians\r\nin the direction of Thrace and against Amphipolis, under the command of\r\nNicias, son of Niceratus, which had to be broken up mainly because of\r\nhis desertion. He was therefore proclaimed an enemy. And thus the\r\nwinter ended, and the fifteenth year of the war ended with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVII\r\n\r\n\r\nSixteenth Year of the War—The Melian Conference—Fate of Melos\r\n\r\n\r\nThe next summer Alcibiades sailed with twenty ships to Argos and seized\r\nthe suspected persons still left of the Lacedaemonian faction to the\r\nnumber of three hundred, whom the Athenians forthwith lodged in the\r\nneighbouring islands of their empire. The Athenians also made an\r\nexpedition against the isle of Melos with thirty ships of their own,\r\nsix Chian, and two Lesbian vessels, sixteen hundred heavy infantry,\r\nthree hundred archers, and twenty mounted archers from Athens, and\r\nabout fifteen hundred heavy infantry from the allies and the islanders.\r\nThe Melians are a colony of Lacedaemon that would not submit to the\r\nAthenians like the other islanders, and at first remained neutral and\r\ntook no part in the struggle, but afterwards upon the Athenians using\r\nviolence and plundering their territory, assumed an attitude of open\r\nhostility. Cleomedes, son of Lycomedes, and Tisias, son of Tisimachus,\r\nthe generals, encamping in their territory with the above armament,\r\nbefore doing any harm to their land, sent envoys to negotiate. These\r\nthe Melians did not bring before the people, but bade them state the\r\nobject of their mission to the magistrates and the few; upon which the\r\nAthenian envoys spoke as follows:\r\n\r\nAthenians. Since the negotiations are not to go on before the people,\r\nin order that we may not be able to speak straight on without\r\ninterruption, and deceive the ears of the multitude by seductive\r\narguments which would pass without refutation (for we know that this is\r\nthe meaning of our being brought before the few), what if you who sit\r\nthere were to pursue a method more cautious still? Make no set speech\r\nyourselves, but take us up at whatever you do not like, and settle that\r\nbefore going any farther. And first tell us if this proposition of ours\r\nsuits you.\r\n\r\nThe Melian commissioners answered:\r\n\r\nMelians. To the fairness of quietly instructing each other as you\r\npropose there is nothing to object; but your military preparations are\r\ntoo far advanced to agree with what you say, as we see you are come to\r\nbe judges in your own cause, and that all we can reasonably expect from\r\nthis negotiation is war, if we prove to have right on our side and\r\nrefuse to submit, and in the contrary case, slavery.\r\n\r\nAthenians. If you have met to reason about presentiments of the future,\r\nor for anything else than to consult for the safety of your state upon\r\nthe facts that you see before you, we will give over; otherwise we will\r\ngo on.\r\n\r\nMelians. It is natural and excusable for men in our position to turn\r\nmore ways than one both in thought and utterance. However, the question\r\nin this conference is, as you say, the safety of our country; and the\r\ndiscussion, if you please, can proceed in the way which you propose.\r\n\r\nAthenians. For ourselves, we shall not trouble you with specious\r\npretences—either of how we have a right to our empire because we\r\noverthrew the Mede, or are now attacking you because of wrong that you\r\nhave done us—and make a long speech which would not be believed; and in\r\nreturn we hope that you, instead of thinking to influence us by saying\r\nthat you did not join the Lacedaemonians, although their colonists, or\r\nthat you have done us no wrong, will aim at what is feasible, holding\r\nin view the real sentiments of us both; since you know as well as we do\r\nthat right, as the world goes, is only in question between equals in\r\npower, while the strong do what they can and the weak suffer what they\r\nmust.\r\n\r\nMelians. As we think, at any rate, it is expedient—we speak as we are\r\nobliged, since you enjoin us to let right alone and talk only of\r\ninterest—that you should not destroy what is our common protection, the\r\nprivilege of being allowed in danger to invoke what is fair and right,\r\nand even to profit by arguments not strictly valid if they can be got\r\nto pass current. And you are as much interested in this as any, as your\r\nfall would be a signal for the heaviest vengeance and an example for\r\nthe world to meditate upon.\r\n\r\nAthenians. The end of our empire, if end it should, does not frighten\r\nus: a rival empire like Lacedaemon, even if Lacedaemon was our real\r\nantagonist, is not so terrible to the vanquished as subjects who by\r\nthemselves attack and overpower their rulers. This, however, is a risk\r\nthat we are content to take. We will now proceed to show you that we\r\nare come here in the interest of our empire, and that we shall say what\r\nwe are now going to say, for the preservation of your country; as we\r\nwould fain exercise that empire over you without trouble, and see you\r\npreserved for the good of us both.\r\n\r\nMelians. And how, pray, could it turn out as good for us to serve as\r\nfor you to rule?\r\n\r\nAthenians. Because you would have the advantage of submitting before\r\nsuffering the worst, and we should gain by not destroying you.\r\n\r\nMelians. So that you would not consent to our being neutral, friends\r\ninstead of enemies, but allies of neither side.\r\n\r\nAthenians. No; for your hostility cannot so much hurt us as your\r\nfriendship will be an argument to our subjects of our weakness, and\r\nyour enmity of our power.\r\n\r\nMelians. Is that your subjects’ idea of equity, to put those who have\r\nnothing to do with you in the same category with peoples that are most\r\nof them your own colonists, and some conquered rebels?\r\n\r\nAthenians. As far as right goes they think one has as much of it as the\r\nother, and that if any maintain their independence it is because they\r\nare strong, and that if we do not molest them it is because we are\r\nafraid; so that besides extending our empire we should gain in security\r\nby your subjection; the fact that you are islanders and weaker than\r\nothers rendering it all the more important that you should not succeed\r\nin baffling the masters of the sea.\r\n\r\nMelians. But do you consider that there is no security in the policy\r\nwhich we indicate? For here again if you debar us from talking about\r\njustice and invite us to obey your interest, we also must explain ours,\r\nand try to persuade you, if the two happen to coincide. How can you\r\navoid making enemies of all existing neutrals who shall look at case\r\nfrom it that one day or another you will attack them? And what is this\r\nbut to make greater the enemies that you have already, and to force\r\nothers to become so who would otherwise have never thought of it?\r\n\r\nAthenians. Why, the fact is that continentals generally give us but\r\nlittle alarm; the liberty which they enjoy will long prevent their\r\ntaking precautions against us; it is rather islanders like yourselves,\r\noutside our empire, and subjects smarting under the yoke, who would be\r\nthe most likely to take a rash step and lead themselves and us into\r\nobvious danger.\r\n\r\nMelians. Well then, if you risk so much to retain your empire, and your\r\nsubjects to get rid of it, it were surely great baseness and cowardice\r\nin us who are still free not to try everything that can be tried,\r\nbefore submitting to your yoke.\r\n\r\nAthenians. Not if you are well advised, the contest not being an equal\r\none, with honour as the prize and shame as the penalty, but a question\r\nof self-preservation and of not resisting those who are far stronger\r\nthan you are.\r\n\r\nMelians. But we know that the fortune of war is sometimes more\r\nimpartial than the disproportion of numbers might lead one to suppose;\r\nto submit is to give ourselves over to despair, while action still\r\npreserves for us a hope that we may stand erect.\r\n\r\nAthenians. Hope, danger’s comforter, may be indulged in by those who\r\nhave abundant resources, if not without loss at all events without\r\nruin; but its nature is to be extravagant, and those who go so far as\r\nto put their all upon the venture see it in its true colours only when\r\nthey are ruined; but so long as the discovery would enable them to\r\nguard against it, it is never found wanting. Let not this be the case\r\nwith you, who are weak and hang on a single turn of the scale; nor be\r\nlike the vulgar, who, abandoning such security as human means may still\r\nafford, when visible hopes fail them in extremity, turn to invisible,\r\nto prophecies and oracles, and other such inventions that delude men\r\nwith hopes to their destruction.\r\n\r\nMelians. You may be sure that we are as well aware as you of the\r\ndifficulty of contending against your power and fortune, unless the\r\nterms be equal. But we trust that the gods may grant us fortune as good\r\nas yours, since we are just men fighting against unjust, and that what\r\nwe want in power will be made up by the alliance of the Lacedaemonians,\r\nwho are bound, if only for very shame, to come to the aid of their\r\nkindred. Our confidence, therefore, after all is not so utterly\r\nirrational.\r\n\r\nAthenians. When you speak of the favour of the gods, we may as fairly\r\nhope for that as yourselves; neither our pretensions nor our conduct\r\nbeing in any way contrary to what men believe of the gods, or practise\r\namong themselves. Of the gods we believe, and of men we know, that by a\r\nnecessary law of their nature they rule wherever they can. And it is\r\nnot as if we were the first to make this law, or to act upon it when\r\nmade: we found it existing before us, and shall leave it to exist for\r\never after us; all we do is to make use of it, knowing that you and\r\neverybody else, having the same power as we have, would do the same as\r\nwe do. Thus, as far as the gods are concerned, we have no fear and no\r\nreason to fear that we shall be at a disadvantage. But when we come to\r\nyour notion about the Lacedaemonians, which leads you to believe that\r\nshame will make them help you, here we bless your simplicity but do not\r\nenvy your folly. The Lacedaemonians, when their own interests or their\r\ncountry’s laws are in question, are the worthiest men alive; of their\r\nconduct towards others much might be said, but no clearer idea of it\r\ncould be given than by shortly saying that of all the men we know they\r\nare most conspicuous in considering what is agreeable honourable, and\r\nwhat is expedient just. Such a way of thinking does not promise much\r\nfor the safety which you now unreasonably count upon.\r\n\r\nMelians. But it is for this very reason that we now trust to their\r\nrespect for expediency to prevent them from betraying the Melians,\r\ntheir colonists, and thereby losing the confidence of their friends in\r\nHellas and helping their enemies.\r\n\r\nAthenians. Then you do not adopt the view that expediency goes with\r\nsecurity, while justice and honour cannot be followed without danger;\r\nand danger the Lacedaemonians generally court as little as possible.\r\n\r\nMelians. But we believe that they would be more likely to face even\r\ndanger for our sake, and with more confidence than for others, as our\r\nnearness to Peloponnese makes it easier for them to act, and our common\r\nblood ensures our fidelity.\r\n\r\nAthenians. Yes, but what an intending ally trusts to is not the\r\ngoodwill of those who ask his aid, but a decided superiority of power\r\nfor action; and the Lacedaemonians look to this even more than others.\r\nAt least, such is their distrust of their home resources that it is\r\nonly with numerous allies that they attack a neighbour; now is it\r\nlikely that while we are masters of the sea they will cross over to an\r\nisland?\r\n\r\nMelians. But they would have others to send. The Cretan Sea is a wide\r\none, and it is more difficult for those who command it to intercept\r\nothers, than for those who wish to elude them to do so safely. And\r\nshould the Lacedaemonians miscarry in this, they would fall upon your\r\nland, and upon those left of your allies whom Brasidas did not reach;\r\nand instead of places which are not yours, you will have to fight for\r\nyour own country and your own confederacy.\r\n\r\nAthenians. Some diversion of the kind you speak of you may one day\r\nexperience, only to learn, as others have done, that the Athenians\r\nnever once yet withdrew from a siege for fear of any. But we are struck\r\nby the fact that, after saying you would consult for the safety of your\r\ncountry, in all this discussion you have mentioned nothing which men\r\nmight trust in and think to be saved by. Your strongest arguments\r\ndepend upon hope and the future, and your actual resources are too\r\nscanty, as compared with those arrayed against you, for you to come out\r\nvictorious. You will therefore show great blindness of judgment,\r\nunless, after allowing us to retire, you can find some counsel more\r\nprudent than this. You will surely not be caught by that idea of\r\ndisgrace, which in dangers that are disgraceful, and at the same time\r\ntoo plain to be mistaken, proves so fatal to mankind; since in too many\r\ncases the very men that have their eyes perfectly open to what they are\r\nrushing into, let the thing called disgrace, by the mere influence of a\r\nseductive name, lead them on to a point at which they become so\r\nenslaved by the phrase as in fact to fall wilfully into hopeless\r\ndisaster, and incur disgrace more disgraceful as the companion of\r\nerror, than when it comes as the result of misfortune. This, if you are\r\nwell advised, you will guard against; and you will not think it\r\ndishonourable to submit to the greatest city in Hellas, when it makes\r\nyou the moderate offer of becoming its tributary ally, without ceasing\r\nto enjoy the country that belongs to you; nor when you have the choice\r\ngiven you between war and security, will you be so blinded as to choose\r\nthe worse. And it is certain that those who do not yield to their\r\nequals, who keep terms with their superiors, and are moderate towards\r\ntheir inferiors, on the whole succeed best. Think over the matter,\r\ntherefore, after our withdrawal, and reflect once and again that it is\r\nfor your country that you are consulting, that you have not more than\r\none, and that upon this one deliberation depends its prosperity or\r\nruin.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians now withdrew from the conference; and the Melians, left\r\nto themselves, came to a decision corresponding with what they had\r\nmaintained in the discussion, and answered: “Our resolution, Athenians,\r\nis the same as it was at first. We will not in a moment deprive of\r\nfreedom a city that has been inhabited these seven hundred years; but\r\nwe put our trust in the fortune by which the gods have preserved it\r\nuntil now, and in the help of men, that is, of the Lacedaemonians; and\r\nso we will try and save ourselves. Meanwhile we invite you to allow us\r\nto be friends to you and foes to neither party, and to retire from our\r\ncountry after making such a treaty as shall seem fit to us both.”\r\n\r\nSuch was the answer of the Melians. The Athenians now departing from\r\nthe conference said: “Well, you alone, as it seems to us, judging from\r\nthese resolutions, regard what is future as more certain than what is\r\nbefore your eyes, and what is out of sight, in your eagerness, as\r\nalready coming to pass; and as you have staked most on, and trusted\r\nmost in, the Lacedaemonians, your fortune, and your hopes, so will you\r\nbe most completely deceived.”\r\n\r\nThe Athenian envoys now returned to the army; and the Melians showing\r\nno signs of yielding, the generals at once betook themselves to\r\nhostilities, and drew a line of circumvallation round the Melians,\r\ndividing the work among the different states. Subsequently the\r\nAthenians returned with most of their army, leaving behind them a\r\ncertain number of their own citizens and of the allies to keep guard by\r\nland and sea. The force thus left stayed on and besieged the place.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Argives invaded the territory of Phlius and\r\nlost eighty men cut off in an ambush by the Phliasians and Argive\r\nexiles. Meanwhile the Athenians at Pylos took so much plunder from the\r\nLacedaemonians that the latter, although they still refrained from\r\nbreaking off the treaty and going to war with Athens, yet proclaimed\r\nthat any of their people that chose might plunder the Athenians. The\r\nCorinthians also commenced hostilities with the Athenians for private\r\nquarrels of their own; but the rest of the Peloponnesians stayed quiet.\r\nMeanwhile the Melians attacked by night and took the part of the\r\nAthenian lines over against the market, and killed some of the men, and\r\nbrought in corn and all else that they could find useful to them, and\r\nso returned and kept quiet, while the Athenians took measures to keep\r\nbetter guard in future.\r\n\r\nSummer was now over. The next winter the Lacedaemonians intended to\r\ninvade the Argive territory, but arriving at the frontier found the\r\nsacrifices for crossing unfavourable, and went back again. This\r\nintention of theirs gave the Argives suspicions of certain of their\r\nfellow citizens, some of whom they arrested; others, however, escaped\r\nthem. About the same time the Melians again took another part of the\r\nAthenian lines which were but feebly garrisoned. Reinforcements\r\nafterwards arriving from Athens in consequence, under the command of\r\nPhilocrates, son of Demeas, the siege was now pressed vigorously; and\r\nsome treachery taking place inside, the Melians surrendered at\r\ndiscretion to the Athenians, who put to death all the grown men whom\r\nthey took, and sold the women and children for slaves, and subsequently\r\nsent out five hundred colonists and inhabited the place themselves.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VI\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventeenth Year of the War—The Sicilian Campaign—Affair of the\r\nHermae—Departure of the Expedition\r\n\r\n\r\nThe same winter the Athenians resolved to sail again to Sicily, with a\r\ngreater armament than that under Laches and Eurymedon, and, if\r\npossible, to conquer the island; most of them being ignorant of its\r\nsize and of the number of its inhabitants, Hellenic and barbarian, and\r\nof the fact that they were undertaking a war not much inferior to that\r\nagainst the Peloponnesians. For the voyage round Sicily in a\r\nmerchantman is not far short of eight days; and yet, large as the\r\nisland is, there are only two miles of sea to prevent its being\r\nmainland.\r\n\r\nIt was settled originally as follows, and the peoples that occupied it\r\nare these. The earliest inhabitants spoken of in any part of the\r\ncountry are the Cyclopes and Laestrygones; but I cannot tell of what\r\nrace they were, or whence they came or whither they went, and must\r\nleave my readers to what the poets have said of them and to what may be\r\ngenerally known concerning them. The Sicanians appear to have been the\r\nnext settlers, although they pretend to have been the first of all and\r\naborigines; but the facts show that they were Iberians, driven by the\r\nLigurians from the river Sicanus in Iberia. It was from them that the\r\nisland, before called Trinacria, took its name of Sicania, and to the\r\npresent day they inhabit the west of Sicily. On the fall of Ilium, some\r\nof the Trojans escaped from the Achaeans, came in ships to Sicily, and\r\nsettled next to the Sicanians under the general name of Elymi; their\r\ntowns being called Eryx and Egesta. With them settled some of the\r\nPhocians carried on their way from Troy by a storm, first to Libya, and\r\nafterwards from thence to Sicily. The Sicels crossed over to Sicily\r\nfrom their first home Italy, flying from the Opicans, as tradition says\r\nand as seems not unlikely, upon rafts, having watched till the wind set\r\ndown the strait to effect the passage; although perhaps they may have\r\nsailed over in some other way. Even at the present day there are still\r\nSicels in Italy; and the country got its name of Italy from Italus, a\r\nking of the Sicels, so called. These went with a great host to Sicily,\r\ndefeated the Sicanians in battle and forced them to remove to the south\r\nand west of the island, which thus came to be called Sicily instead of\r\nSicania, and after they crossed over continued to enjoy the richest\r\nparts of the country for near three hundred years before any Hellenes\r\ncame to Sicily; indeed they still hold the centre and north of the\r\nisland. There were also Phoenicians living all round Sicily, who had\r\noccupied promontories upon the sea coasts and the islets adjacent for\r\nthe purpose of trading with the Sicels. But when the Hellenes began to\r\narrive in considerable numbers by sea, the Phoenicians abandoned most\r\nof their stations, and drawing together took up their abode in Motye,\r\nSoloeis, and Panormus, near the Elymi, partly because they confided in\r\ntheir alliance, and also because these are the nearest points for the\r\nvoyage between Carthage and Sicily.\r\n\r\nThese were the barbarians in Sicily, settled as I have said. Of the\r\nHellenes, the first to arrive were Chalcidians from Euboea with\r\nThucles, their founder. They founded Naxos and built the altar to\r\nApollo Archegetes, which now stands outside the town, and upon which\r\nthe deputies for the games sacrifice before sailing from Sicily.\r\nSyracuse was founded the year afterwards by Archias, one of the\r\nHeraclids from Corinth, who began by driving out the Sicels from the\r\nisland upon which the inner city now stands, though it is no longer\r\nsurrounded by water: in process of time the outer town also was taken\r\nwithin the walls and became populous. Meanwhile Thucles and the\r\nChalcidians set out from Naxos in the fifth year after the foundation\r\nof Syracuse, and drove out the Sicels by arms and founded Leontini and\r\nafterwards Catana; the Catanians themselves choosing Evarchus as their\r\nfounder.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Lamis arrived in Sicily with a colony from Megara,\r\nand after founding a place called Trotilus beyond the river Pantacyas,\r\nand afterwards leaving it and for a short while joining the Chalcidians\r\nat Leontini, was driven out by them and founded Thapsus. After his\r\ndeath his companions were driven out of Thapsus, and founded a place\r\ncalled the Hyblaean Megara; Hyblon, a Sicel king, having given up the\r\nplace and inviting them thither. Here they lived two hundred and\r\nforty-five years; after which they were expelled from the city and the\r\ncountry by the Syracusan tyrant Gelo. Before their expulsion, however,\r\na hundred years after they had settled there, they sent out Pamillus\r\nand founded Selinus; he having come from their mother country Megara to\r\njoin them in its foundation. Gela was founded by Antiphemus from Rhodes\r\nand Entimus from Crete, who joined in leading a colony thither, in the\r\nforty-fifth year after the foundation of Syracuse. The town took its\r\nname from the river Gelas, the place where the citadel now stands, and\r\nwhich was first fortified, being called Lindii. The institutions which\r\nthey adopted were Dorian. Near one hundred and eight years after the\r\nfoundation of Gela, the Geloans founded Acragas (Agrigentum), so called\r\nfrom the river of that name, and made Aristonous and Pystilus their\r\nfounders; giving their own institutions to the colony. Zancle was\r\noriginally founded by pirates from Cuma, the Chalcidian town in the\r\ncountry of the Opicans: afterwards, however, large numbers came from\r\nChalcis and the rest of Euboea, and helped to people the place; the\r\nfounders being Perieres and Crataemenes from Cuma and Chalcis\r\nrespectively. It first had the name of Zancle given it by the Sicels,\r\nbecause the place is shaped like a sickle, which the Sicels call\r\nzanclon; but upon the original settlers being afterwards expelled by\r\nsome Samians and other Ionians who landed in Sicily flying from the\r\nMedes, and the Samians in their turn not long afterwards by Anaxilas,\r\ntyrant of Rhegium, the town was by him colonized with a mixed\r\npopulation, and its name changed to Messina, after his old country.\r\n\r\nHimera was founded from Zancle by Euclides, Simus, and Sacon, most of\r\nthose who went to the colony being Chalcidians; though they were joined\r\nby some exiles from Syracuse, defeated in a civil war, called the\r\nMyletidae. The language was a mixture of Chalcidian and Doric, but the\r\ninstitutions which prevailed were the Chalcidian. Acrae and Casmenae\r\nwere founded by the Syracusans; Acrae seventy years after Syracuse,\r\nCasmenae nearly twenty after Acrae. Camarina was first founded by the\r\nSyracusans, close upon a hundred and thirty-five years after the\r\nbuilding of Syracuse; its founders being Daxon and Menecolus. But the\r\nCamarinaeans being expelled by arms by the Syracusans for having\r\nrevolted, Hippocrates, tyrant of Gela, some time later receiving their\r\nland in ransom for some Syracusan prisoners, resettled Camarina,\r\nhimself acting as its founder. Lastly, it was again depopulated by\r\nGelo, and settled once more for the third time by the Geloans.\r\n\r\nSuch is the list of the peoples, Hellenic and barbarian, inhabiting\r\nSicily, and such the magnitude of the island which the Athenians were\r\nnow bent upon invading; being ambitious in real truth of conquering the\r\nwhole, although they had also the specious design of succouring their\r\nkindred and other allies in the island. But they were especially\r\nincited by envoys from Egesta, who had come to Athens and invoked their\r\naid more urgently than ever. The Egestaeans had gone to war with their\r\nneighbours the Selinuntines upon questions of marriage and disputed\r\nterritory, and the Selinuntines had procured the alliance of the\r\nSyracusans, and pressed Egesta hard by land and sea. The Egestaeans now\r\nreminded the Athenians of the alliance made in the time of Laches,\r\nduring the former Leontine war, and begged them to send a fleet to\r\ntheir aid, and among a number of other considerations urged as a\r\ncapital argument that if the Syracusans were allowed to go unpunished\r\nfor their depopulation of Leontini, to ruin the allies still left to\r\nAthens in Sicily, and to get the whole power of the island into their\r\nhands, there would be a danger of their one day coming with a large\r\nforce, as Dorians, to the aid of their Dorian brethren, and as\r\ncolonists, to the aid of the Peloponnesians who had sent them out, and\r\njoining these in pulling down the Athenian empire. The Athenians would,\r\ntherefore, do well to unite with the allies still left to them, and to\r\nmake a stand against the Syracusans; especially as they, the\r\nEgestaeans, were prepared to furnish money sufficient for the war. The\r\nAthenians, hearing these arguments constantly repeated in their\r\nassemblies by the Egestaeans and their supporters, voted first to send\r\nenvoys to Egesta, to see if there was really the money that they talked\r\nof in the treasury and temples, and at the same time to ascertain in\r\nwhat posture was the war with the Selinuntines.\r\n\r\nThe envoys of the Athenians were accordingly dispatched to Sicily. The\r\nsame winter the Lacedaemonians and their allies, the Corinthians\r\nexcepted, marched into the Argive territory, and ravaged a small part\r\nof the land, and took some yokes of oxen and carried off some corn.\r\nThey also settled the Argive exiles at Orneae, and left them a few\r\nsoldiers taken from the rest of the army; and after making a truce for\r\na certain while, according to which neither Orneatae nor Argives were\r\nto injure each other’s territory, returned home with the army. Not long\r\nafterwards the Athenians came with thirty ships and six hundred heavy\r\ninfantry, and the Argives joining them with all their forces, marched\r\nout and besieged the men in Orneae for one day; but the garrison\r\nescaped by night, the besiegers having bivouacked some way off. The\r\nnext day the Argives, discovering it, razed Orneae to the ground, and\r\nwent back again; after which the Athenians went home in their ships.\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians took by sea to Methone on the Macedonian border\r\nsome cavalry of their own and the Macedonian exiles that were at\r\nAthens, and plundered the country of Perdiccas. Upon this the\r\nLacedaemonians sent to the Thracian Chalcidians, who had a truce with\r\nAthens from one ten days to another, urging them to join Perdiccas in\r\nthe war, which they refused to do. And the winter ended, and with it\r\nended the sixteenth year of this war of which Thucydides is the\r\nhistorian.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of the following summer the Athenian envoys arrived\r\nfrom Sicily, and the Egestaeans with them, bringing sixty talents of\r\nuncoined silver, as a month’s pay for sixty ships, which they were to\r\nask to have sent them. The Athenians held an assembly and, after\r\nhearing from the Egestaeans and their own envoys a report, as\r\nattractive as it was untrue, upon the state of affairs generally, and\r\nin particular as to the money, of which, it was said, there was\r\nabundance in the temples and the treasury, voted to send sixty ships to\r\nSicily, under the command of Alcibiades, son of Clinias, Nicias, son of\r\nNiceratus, and Lamachus, son of Xenophanes, who were appointed with\r\nfull powers; they were to help the Egestaeans against the Selinuntines,\r\nto restore Leontini upon gaining any advantage in the war, and to order\r\nall other matters in Sicily as they should deem best for the interests\r\nof Athens. Five days after this a second assembly was held, to consider\r\nthe speediest means of equipping the ships, and to vote whatever else\r\nmight be required by the generals for the expedition; and Nicias, who\r\nhad been chosen to the command against his will, and who thought that\r\nthe state was not well advised, but upon a slight aid specious pretext\r\nwas aspiring to the conquest of the whole of Sicily, a great matter to\r\nachieve, came forward in the hope of diverting the Athenians from the\r\nenterprise, and gave them the following counsel:\r\n\r\n“Although this assembly was convened to consider the preparations to be\r\nmade for sailing to Sicily, I think, notwithstanding, that we have\r\nstill this question to examine, whether it be better to send out the\r\nships at all, and that we ought not to give so little consideration to\r\na matter of such moment, or let ourselves be persuaded by foreigners\r\ninto undertaking a war with which we have nothing to do. And yet,\r\nindividually, I gain in honour by such a course, and fear as little as\r\nother men for my person—not that I think a man need be any the worse\r\ncitizen for taking some thought for his person and estate; on the\r\ncontrary, such a man would for his own sake desire the prosperity of\r\nhis country more than others—nevertheless, as I have never spoken\r\nagainst my convictions to gain honour, I shall not begin to do so now,\r\nbut shall say what I think best. Against your character any words of\r\nmine would be weak enough, if I were to advise your keeping what you\r\nhave got and not risking what is actually yours for advantages which\r\nare dubious in themselves, and which you may or may not attain. I will,\r\ntherefore, content myself with showing that your ardour is out of\r\nseason, and your ambition not easy of accomplishment.\r\n\r\n“I affirm, then, that you leave many enemies behind you here to go\r\nyonder and bring more back with you. You imagine, perhaps, that the\r\ntreaty which you have made can be trusted; a treaty that will continue\r\nto exist nominally, as long as you keep quiet—for nominal it has\r\nbecome, owing to the practices of certain men here and at Sparta—but\r\nwhich in the event of a serious reverse in any quarter would not delay\r\nour enemies a moment in attacking us; first, because the convention was\r\nforced upon them by disaster and was less honourable to them than to\r\nus; and secondly, because in this very convention there are many points\r\nthat are still disputed. Again, some of the most powerful states have\r\nnever yet accepted the arrangement at all. Some of these are at open\r\nwar with us; others (as the Lacedaemonians do not yet move) are\r\nrestrained by truces renewed every ten days, and it is only too\r\nprobable that if they found our power divided, as we are hurrying to\r\ndivide it, they would attack us vigorously with the Siceliots, whose\r\nalliance they would have in the past valued as they would that of few\r\nothers. A man ought, therefore, to consider these points, and not to\r\nthink of running risks with a country placed so critically, or of\r\ngrasping at another empire before we have secured the one we have\r\nalready; for in fact the Thracian Chalcidians have been all these years\r\nin revolt from us without being yet subdued, and others on the\r\ncontinents yield us but a doubtful obedience. Meanwhile the Egestaeans,\r\nour allies, have been wronged, and we run to help them, while the\r\nrebels who have so long wronged us still wait for punishment.\r\n\r\n“And yet the latter, if brought under, might be kept under; while the\r\nSicilians, even if conquered, are too far off and too numerous to be\r\nruled without difficulty. Now it is folly to go against men who could\r\nnot be kept under even if conquered, while failure would leave us in a\r\nvery different position from that which we occupied before the\r\nenterprise. The Siceliots, again, to take them as they are at present,\r\nin the event of a Syracusan conquest (the favourite bugbear of the\r\nEgestaeans), would to my thinking be even less dangerous to us than\r\nbefore. At present they might possibly come here as separate states for\r\nlove of Lacedaemon; in the other case one empire would scarcely attack\r\nanother; for after joining the Peloponnesians to overthrow ours, they\r\ncould only expect to see the same hands overthrow their own in the same\r\nway. The Hellenes in Sicily would fear us most if we never went there\r\nat all, and next to this, if after displaying our power we went away\r\nagain as soon as possible. We all know that that which is farthest off,\r\nand the reputation of which can least be tested, is the object of\r\nadmiration; at the least reverse they would at once begin to look down\r\nupon us, and would join our enemies here against us. You have\r\nyourselves experienced this with regard to the Lacedaemonians and their\r\nallies, whom your unexpected success, as compared with what you feared\r\nat first, has made you suddenly despise, tempting you further to aspire\r\nto the conquest of Sicily. Instead, however, of being puffed up by the\r\nmisfortunes of your adversaries, you ought to think of breaking their\r\nspirit before giving yourselves up to confidence, and to understand\r\nthat the one thought awakened in the Lacedaemonians by their disgrace\r\nis how they may even now, if possible, overthrow us and repair their\r\ndishonour; inasmuch as military reputation is their oldest and chiefest\r\nstudy. Our struggle, therefore, if we are wise, will not be for the\r\nbarbarian Egestaeans in Sicily, but how to defend ourselves most\r\neffectually against the oligarchical machinations of Lacedaemon.\r\n\r\n“We should also remember that we are but now enjoying some respite from\r\na great pestilence and from war, to the no small benefit of our estates\r\nand persons, and that it is right to employ these at home on our own\r\nbehalf, instead of using them on behalf of these exiles whose interest\r\nit is to lie as fairly as they can, who do nothing but talk themselves\r\nand leave the danger to others, and who if they succeed will show no\r\nproper gratitude, and if they fail will drag down their friends with\r\nthem. And if there be any man here, overjoyed at being chosen to\r\ncommand, who urges you to make the expedition, merely for ends of his\r\nown—specially if he be still too young to command—who seeks to be\r\nadmired for his stud of horses, but on account of its heavy expenses\r\nhopes for some profit from his appointment, do not allow such a one to\r\nmaintain his private splendour at his country’s risk, but remember that\r\nsuch persons injure the public fortune while they squander their own,\r\nand that this is a matter of importance, and not for a young man to\r\ndecide or hastily to take in hand.\r\n\r\n“When I see such persons now sitting here at the side of that same\r\nindividual and summoned by him, alarm seizes me; and I, in my turn,\r\nsummon any of the older men that may have such a person sitting next\r\nhim not to let himself be shamed down, for fear of being thought a\r\ncoward if he do not vote for war, but, remembering how rarely success\r\nis got by wishing and how often by forecast, to leave to them the mad\r\ndream of conquest, and as a true lover of his country, now threatened\r\nby the greatest danger in its history, to hold up his hand on the other\r\nside; to vote that the Siceliots be left in the limits now existing\r\nbetween us, limits of which no one can complain (the Ionian sea for the\r\ncoasting voyage, and the Sicilian across the open main), to enjoy their\r\nown possessions and to settle their own quarrels; that the Egestaeans,\r\nfor their part, be told to end by themselves with the Selinuntines the\r\nwar which they began without consulting the Athenians; and that for the\r\nfuture we do not enter into alliance, as we have been used to do, with\r\npeople whom we must help in their need, and who can never help us in\r\nours.\r\n\r\n“And you, Prytanis, if you think it your duty to care for the\r\ncommonwealth, and if you wish to show yourself a good citizen, put the\r\nquestion to the vote, and take a second time the opinions of the\r\nAthenians. If you are afraid to move the question again, consider that\r\na violation of the law cannot carry any prejudice with so many\r\nabettors, that you will be the physician of your misguided city, and\r\nthat the virtue of men in office is briefly this, to do their country\r\nas much good as they can, or in any case no harm that they can avoid.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Nicias. Most of the Athenians that came forward\r\nspoke in favour of the expedition, and of not annulling what had been\r\nvoted, although some spoke on the other side. By far the warmest\r\nadvocate of the expedition was, however, Alcibiades, son of Clinias,\r\nwho wished to thwart Nicias both as his political opponent and also\r\nbecause of the attack he had made upon him in his speech, and who was,\r\nbesides, exceedingly ambitious of a command by which he hoped to reduce\r\nSicily and Carthage, and personally to gain in wealth and reputation by\r\nmeans of his successes. For the position he held among the citizens led\r\nhim to indulge his tastes beyond what his real means would bear, both\r\nin keeping horses and in the rest of his expenditure; and this later on\r\nhad not a little to do with the ruin of the Athenian state. Alarmed at\r\nthe greatness of his licence in his own life and habits, and of the\r\nambition which he showed in all things soever that he undertook, the\r\nmass of the people set him down as a pretender to the tyranny, and\r\nbecame his enemies; and although publicly his conduct of the war was as\r\ngood as could be desired, individually, his habits gave offence to\r\nevery one, and caused them to commit affairs to other hands, and thus\r\nbefore long to ruin the city. Meanwhile he now came forward and gave\r\nthe following advice to the Athenians:\r\n\r\n“Athenians, I have a better right to command than others—I must begin\r\nwith this as Nicias has attacked me—and at the same time I believe\r\nmyself to be worthy of it. The things for which I am abused, bring fame\r\nto my ancestors and to myself, and to the country profit besides. The\r\nHellenes, after expecting to see our city ruined by the war, concluded\r\nit to be even greater than it really is, by reason of the magnificence\r\nwith which I represented it at the Olympic games, when I sent into the\r\nlists seven chariots, a number never before entered by any private\r\nperson, and won the first prize, and was second and fourth, and took\r\ncare to have everything else in a style worthy of my victory. Custom\r\nregards such displays as honourable, and they cannot be made without\r\nleaving behind them an impression of power. Again, any splendour that I\r\nmay have exhibited at home in providing choruses or otherwise, is\r\nnaturally envied by my fellow citizens, but in the eyes of foreigners\r\nhas an air of strength as in the other instance. And this is no useless\r\nfolly, when a man at his own private cost benefits not himself only,\r\nbut his city: nor is it unfair that he who prides himself on his\r\nposition should refuse to be upon an equality with the rest. He who is\r\nbadly off has his misfortunes all to himself, and as we do not see men\r\ncourted in adversity, on the like principle a man ought to accept the\r\ninsolence of prosperity; or else, let him first mete out equal measure\r\nto all, and then demand to have it meted out to him. What I know is\r\nthat persons of this kind and all others that have attained to any\r\ndistinction, although they may be unpopular in their lifetime in their\r\nrelations with their fellow-men and especially with their equals, leave\r\nto posterity the desire of claiming connection with them even without\r\nany ground, and are vaunted by the country to which they belonged, not\r\nas strangers or ill-doers, but as fellow-countrymen and heroes. Such\r\nare my aspirations, and however I am abused for them in private, the\r\nquestion is whether any one manages public affairs better than I do.\r\nHaving united the most powerful states of Peloponnese, without great\r\ndanger or expense to you, I compelled the Lacedaemonians to stake their\r\nall upon the issue of a single day at Mantinea; and although victorious\r\nin the battle, they have never since fully recovered confidence.\r\n\r\n“Thus did my youth and so-called monstrous folly find fitting arguments\r\nto deal with the power of the Peloponnesians, and by its ardour win\r\ntheir confidence and prevail. And do not be afraid of my youth now, but\r\nwhile I am still in its flower, and Nicias appears fortunate, avail\r\nyourselves to the utmost of the services of us both. Neither rescind\r\nyour resolution to sail to Sicily, on the ground that you would be\r\ngoing to attack a great power. The cities in Sicily are peopled by\r\nmotley rabbles, and easily change their institutions and adopt new ones\r\nin their stead; and consequently the inhabitants, being without any\r\nfeeling of patriotism, are not provided with arms for their persons,\r\nand have not regularly established themselves on the land; every man\r\nthinks that either by fair words or by party strife he can obtain\r\nsomething at the public expense, and then in the event of a catastrophe\r\nsettle in some other country, and makes his preparations accordingly.\r\nFrom a mob like this you need not look for either unanimity in counsel\r\nor concert in action; but they will probably one by one come in as they\r\nget a fair offer, especially if they are torn by civil strife as we are\r\ntold. Moreover, the Siceliots have not so many heavy infantry as they\r\nboast; just as the Hellenes generally did not prove so numerous as each\r\nstate reckoned itself, but Hellas greatly over-estimated their numbers,\r\nand has hardly had an adequate force of heavy infantry throughout this\r\nwar. The states in Sicily, therefore, from all that I can hear, will be\r\nfound as I say, and I have not pointed out all our advantages, for we\r\nshall have the help of many barbarians, who from their hatred of the\r\nSyracusans will join us in attacking them; nor will the powers at home\r\nprove any hindrance, if you judge rightly. Our fathers with these very\r\nadversaries, which it is said we shall now leave behind us when we\r\nsail, and the Mede as their enemy as well, were able to win the empire,\r\ndepending solely on their superiority at sea. The Peloponnesians had\r\nnever so little hope against us as at present; and let them be ever so\r\nsanguine, although strong enough to invade our country even if we stay\r\nat home, they can never hurt us with their navy, as we leave one of our\r\nown behind us that is a match for them.\r\n\r\n“In this state of things what reason can we give to ourselves for\r\nholding back, or what excuse can we offer to our allies in Sicily for\r\nnot helping them? They are our confederates, and we are bound to assist\r\nthem, without objecting that they have not assisted us. We did not take\r\nthem into alliance to have them to help us in Hellas, but that they\r\nmight so annoy our enemies in Sicily as to prevent them from coming\r\nover here and attacking us. It is thus that empire has been won, both\r\nby us and by all others that have held it, by a constant readiness to\r\nsupport all, whether barbarians or Hellenes, that invite assistance;\r\nsince if all were to keep quiet or to pick and choose whom they ought\r\nto assist, we should make but few new conquests, and should imperil\r\nthose we have already won. Men do not rest content with parrying the\r\nattacks of a superior, but often strike the first blow to prevent the\r\nattack being made. And we cannot fix the exact point at which our\r\nempire shall stop; we have reached a position in which we must not be\r\ncontent with retaining but must scheme to extend it, for, if we cease\r\nto rule others, we are in danger of being ruled ourselves. Nor can you\r\nlook at inaction from the same point of view as others, unless you are\r\nprepared to change your habits and make them like theirs.\r\n\r\n“Be convinced, then, that we shall augment our power at home by this\r\nadventure abroad, and let us make the expedition, and so humble the\r\npride of the Peloponnesians by sailing off to Sicily, and letting them\r\nsee how little we care for the peace that we are now enjoying; and at\r\nthe same time we shall either become masters, as we very easily may, of\r\nthe whole of Hellas through the accession of the Sicilian Hellenes, or\r\nin any case ruin the Syracusans, to the no small advantage of ourselves\r\nand our allies. The faculty of staying if successful, or of returning,\r\nwill be secured to us by our navy, as we shall be superior at sea to\r\nall the Siceliots put together. And do not let the do-nothing policy\r\nwhich Nicias advocates, or his setting of the young against the old,\r\nturn you from your purpose, but in the good old fashion by which our\r\nfathers, old and young together, by their united counsels brought our\r\naffairs to their present height, do you endeavour still to advance\r\nthem; understanding that neither youth nor old age can do anything the\r\none without the other, but that levity, sobriety, and deliberate\r\njudgment are strongest when united, and that, by sinking into inaction,\r\nthe city, like everything else, will wear itself out, and its skill in\r\neverything decay; while each fresh struggle will give it fresh\r\nexperience, and make it more used to defend itself not in word but in\r\ndeed. In short, my conviction is that a city not inactive by nature\r\ncould not choose a quicker way to ruin itself than by suddenly adopting\r\nsuch a policy, and that the safest rule of life is to take one’s\r\ncharacter and institutions for better and for worse, and to live up to\r\nthem as closely as one can.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Alcibiades. After hearing him and the Egestaeans\r\nand some Leontine exiles, who came forward reminding them of their\r\noaths and imploring their assistance, the Athenians became more eager\r\nfor the expedition than before. Nicias, perceiving that it would be now\r\nuseless to try to deter them by the old line of argument, but thinking\r\nthat he might perhaps alter their resolution by the extravagance of his\r\nestimates, came forward a second time and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“I see, Athenians, that you are thoroughly bent upon the expedition,\r\nand therefore hope that all will turn out as we wish, and proceed to\r\ngive you my opinion at the present juncture. From all that I hear we\r\nare going against cities that are great and not subject to one another,\r\nor in need of change, so as to be glad to pass from enforced servitude\r\nto an easier condition, or in the least likely to accept our rule in\r\nexchange for freedom; and, to take only the Hellenic towns, they are\r\nvery numerous for one island. Besides Naxos and Catana, which I expect\r\nto join us from their connection with Leontini, there are seven others\r\narmed at all points just like our own power, particularly Selinus and\r\nSyracuse, the chief objects of our expedition. These are full of heavy\r\ninfantry, archers, and darters, have galleys in abundance and crowds to\r\nman them; they have also money, partly in the hands of private persons,\r\npartly in the temples at Selinus, and at Syracuse first-fruits from\r\nsome of the barbarians as well. But their chief advantage over us lies\r\nin the number of their horses, and in the fact that they grow their\r\ncorn at home instead of importing it.\r\n\r\n“Against a power of this kind it will not do to have merely a weak\r\nnaval armament, but we shall want also a large land army to sail with\r\nus, if we are to do anything worthy of our ambition, and are not to be\r\nshut out from the country by a numerous cavalry; especially if the\r\ncities should take alarm and combine, and we should be left without\r\nfriends (except the Egestaeans) to furnish us with horse to defend\r\nourselves with. It would be disgraceful to have to retire under\r\ncompulsion, or to send back for reinforcements, owing to want of\r\nreflection at first: we must therefore start from home with a competent\r\nforce, seeing that we are going to sail far from our country, and upon\r\nan expedition not like any which you may undertaken undertaken the\r\nquality of allies, among your subject states here in Hellas, where any\r\nadditional supplies needed were easily drawn from the friendly\r\nterritory; but we are cutting ourselves off, and going to a land\r\nentirely strange, from which during four months in winter it is not\r\neven easy for a messenger get to Athens.\r\n\r\n“I think, therefore, that we ought to take great numbers of heavy\r\ninfantry, both from Athens and from our allies, and not merely from our\r\nsubjects, but also any we may be able to get for love or for money in\r\nPeloponnese, and great numbers also of archers and slingers, to make\r\nhead against the Sicilian horse. Meanwhile we must have an overwhelming\r\nsuperiority at sea, to enable us the more easily to carry in what we\r\nwant; and we must take our own corn in merchant vessels, that is to\r\nsay, wheat and parched barley, and bakers from the mills compelled to\r\nserve for pay in the proper proportion; in order that in case of our\r\nbeing weather-bound the armament may not want provisions, as it is not\r\nevery city that will be able to entertain numbers like ours. We must\r\nalso provide ourselves with everything else as far as we can, so as not\r\nto be dependent upon others; and above all we must take with us from\r\nhome as much money as possible, as the sums talked of as ready at\r\nEgesta are readier, you may be sure, in talk than in any other way.\r\n\r\n“Indeed, even if we leave Athens with a force not only equal to that of\r\nthe enemy except in the number of heavy infantry in the field, but even\r\nat all points superior to him, we shall still find it difficult to\r\nconquer Sicily or save ourselves. We must not disguise from ourselves\r\nthat we go to found a city among strangers and enemies, and that he who\r\nundertakes such an enterprise should be prepared to become master of\r\nthe country the first day he lands, or failing in this to find\r\neverything hostile to him. Fearing this, and knowing that we shall have\r\nneed of much good counsel and more good fortune—a hard matter for\r\nmortal man to aspire to—I wish as far as may be to make myself\r\nindependent of fortune before sailing, and when I do sail, to be as\r\nsafe as a strong force can make me. This I believe to be surest for the\r\ncountry at large, and safest for us who are to go on the expedition. If\r\nany one thinks differently I resign to him my command.”\r\n\r\nWith this Nicias concluded, thinking that he should either disgust the\r\nAthenians by the magnitude of the undertaking, or, if obliged to sail\r\non the expedition, would thus do so in the safest way possible. The\r\nAthenians, however, far from having their taste for the voyage taken\r\naway by the burdensomeness of the preparations, became more eager for\r\nit than ever; and just the contrary took place of what Nicias had\r\nthought, as it was held that he had given good advice, and that the\r\nexpedition would be the safest in the world. All alike fell in love\r\nwith the enterprise. The older men thought that they would either\r\nsubdue the places against which they were to sail, or at all events,\r\nwith so large a force, meet with no disaster; those in the prime of\r\nlife felt a longing for foreign sights and spectacles, and had no doubt\r\nthat they should come safe home again; while the idea of the common\r\npeople and the soldiery was to earn wages at the moment, and make\r\nconquests that would supply a never-ending fund of pay for the future.\r\nWith this enthusiasm of the majority, the few that liked it not, feared\r\nto appear unpatriotic by holding up their hands against it, and so kept\r\nquiet.\r\n\r\nAt last one of the Athenians came forward and called upon Nicias and\r\ntold him that he ought not to make excuses or put them off, but say at\r\nonce before them all what forces the Athenians should vote him. Upon\r\nthis he said, not without reluctance, that he would advise upon that\r\nmatter more at leisure with his colleagues; as far however as he could\r\nsee at present, they must sail with at least one hundred galleys—the\r\nAthenians providing as many transports as they might determine, and\r\nsending for others from the allies—not less than five thousand heavy\r\ninfantry in all, Athenian and allied, and if possible more; and the\r\nrest of the armament in proportion; archers from home and from Crete,\r\nand slingers, and whatever else might seem desirable, being got ready\r\nby the generals and taken with them.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this the Athenians at once voted that the generals should\r\nhave full powers in the matter of the numbers of the army and of the\r\nexpedition generally, to do as they judged best for the interests of\r\nAthens. After this the preparations began; messages being sent to the\r\nallies and the rolls drawn up at home. And as the city had just\r\nrecovered from the plague and the long war, and a number of young men\r\nhad grown up and capital had accumulated by reason of the truce,\r\neverything was the more easily provided.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of these preparations all the stone Hermae in the city of\r\nAthens, that is to say the customary square figures, so common in the\r\ndoorways of private houses and temples, had in one night most of them\r\ntheir fares mutilated. No one knew who had done it, but large public\r\nrewards were offered to find the authors; and it was further voted that\r\nany one who knew of any other act of impiety having been committed\r\nshould come and give information without fear of consequences, whether\r\nhe were citizen, alien, or slave. The matter was taken up the more\r\nseriously, as it was thought to be ominous for the expedition, and part\r\nof a conspiracy to bring about a revolution and to upset the democracy.\r\n\r\nInformation was given accordingly by some resident aliens and body\r\nservants, not about the Hermae but about some previous mutilations of\r\nother images perpetrated by young men in a drunken frolic, and of mock\r\ncelebrations of the mysteries, averred to take place in private houses.\r\nAlcibiades being implicated in this charge, it was taken hold of by\r\nthose who could least endure him, because he stood in the way of their\r\nobtaining the undisturbed direction of the people, and who thought that\r\nif he were once removed the first place would be theirs. These\r\naccordingly magnified the matter and loudly proclaimed that the affair\r\nof the mysteries and the mutilation of the Hermae were part and parcel\r\nof a scheme to overthrow the democracy, and that nothing of all this\r\nhad been done without Alcibiades; the proofs alleged being the general\r\nand undemocratic licence of his life and habits.\r\n\r\nAlcibiades repelled on the spot the charges in question, and also\r\nbefore going on the expedition, the preparations for which were now\r\ncomplete, offered to stand his trial, that it might be seen whether he\r\nwas guilty of the acts imputed to him; desiring to be punished if found\r\nguilty, but, if acquitted, to take the command. Meanwhile he protested\r\nagainst their receiving slanders against him in his absence, and begged\r\nthem rather to put him to death at once if he were guilty, and pointed\r\nout the imprudence of sending him out at the head of so large an army,\r\nwith so serious a charge still undecided. But his enemies feared that\r\nhe would have the army for him if he were tried immediately, and that\r\nthe people might relent in favour of the man whom they already caressed\r\nas the cause of the Argives and some of the Mantineans joining in the\r\nexpedition, and did their utmost to get this proposition rejected,\r\nputting forward other orators who said that he ought at present to sail\r\nand not delay the departure of the army, and be tried on his return\r\nwithin a fixed number of days; their plan being to have him sent for\r\nand brought home for trial upon some graver charge, which they would\r\nthe more easily get up in his absence. Accordingly it was decreed that\r\nhe should sail.\r\n\r\nAfter this the departure for Sicily took place, it being now about\r\nmidsummer. Most of the allies, with the corn transports and the smaller\r\ncraft and the rest of the expedition, had already received orders to\r\nmuster at Corcyra, to cross the Ionian Sea from thence in a body to the\r\nIapygian promontory. But the Athenians themselves, and such of their\r\nallies as happened to be with them, went down to Piraeus upon a day\r\nappointed at daybreak, and began to man the ships for putting out to\r\nsea. With them also went down the whole population, one may say, of the\r\ncity, both citizens and foreigners; the inhabitants of the country each\r\nescorting those that belonged to them, their friends, their relatives,\r\nor their sons, with hope and lamentation upon their way, as they\r\nthought of the conquests which they hoped to make, or of the friends\r\nwhom they might never see again, considering the long voyage which they\r\nwere going to make from their country. Indeed, at this moment, when\r\nthey were now upon the point of parting from one another, the danger\r\ncame more home to them than when they voted for the expedition;\r\nalthough the strength of the armament, and the profuse provision which\r\nthey remarked in every department, was a sight that could not but\r\ncomfort them. As for the foreigners and the rest of the crowd, they\r\nsimply went to see a sight worth looking at and passing all belief.\r\n\r\nIndeed this armament that first sailed out was by far the most costly\r\nand splendid Hellenic force that had ever been sent out by a single\r\ncity up to that time. In mere number of ships and heavy infantry that\r\nagainst Epidaurus under Pericles, and the same when going against\r\nPotidæa under Hagnon, was not inferior; containing as it did four\r\nthousand Athenian heavy infantry, three hundred horse, and one hundred\r\ngalleys accompanied by fifty Lesbian and Chian vessels and many allies\r\nbesides. But these were sent upon a short voyage and with a scanty\r\nequipment. The present expedition was formed in contemplation of a long\r\nterm of service by land and sea alike, and was furnished with ships and\r\ntroops so as to be ready for either as required. The fleet had been\r\nelaborately equipped at great cost to the captains and the state; the\r\ntreasury giving a drachma a day to each seaman, and providing empty\r\nships, sixty men-of-war and forty transports, and manning these with\r\nthe best crews obtainable; while the captains gave a bounty in addition\r\nto the pay from the treasury to the thranitae and crews generally,\r\nbesides spending lavishly upon figure-heads and equipments, and one and\r\nall making the utmost exertions to enable their own ships to excel in\r\nbeauty and fast sailing. Meanwhile the land forces had been picked from\r\nthe best muster-rolls, and vied with each other in paying great\r\nattention to their arms and personal accoutrements. From this resulted\r\nnot only a rivalry among themselves in their different departments, but\r\nan idea among the rest of the Hellenes that it was more a display of\r\npower and resources than an armament against an enemy. For if any one\r\nhad counted up the public expenditure of the state, and the private\r\noutlay of individuals—that is to say, the sums which the state had\r\nalready spent upon the expedition and was sending out in the hands of\r\nthe generals, and those which individuals had expended upon their\r\npersonal outfit, or as captains of galleys had laid out and were still\r\nto lay out upon their vessels; and if he had added to this the journey\r\nmoney which each was likely to have provided himself with,\r\nindependently of the pay from the treasury, for a voyage of such\r\nlength, and what the soldiers or traders took with them for the purpose\r\nof exchange—it would have been found that many talents in all were\r\nbeing taken out of the city. Indeed the expedition became not less\r\nfamous for its wonderful boldness and for the splendour of its\r\nappearance, than for its overwhelming strength as compared with the\r\npeoples against whom it was directed, and for the fact that this was\r\nthe longest passage from home hitherto attempted, and the most\r\nambitious in its objects considering the resources of those who\r\nundertook it.\r\n\r\nThe ships being now manned, and everything put on board with which they\r\nmeant to sail, the trumpet commanded silence, and the prayers customary\r\nbefore putting out to sea were offered, not in each ship by itself, but\r\nby all together to the voice of a herald; and bowls of wine were mixed\r\nthrough all the armament, and libations made by the soldiers and their\r\nofficers in gold and silver goblets. In their prayers joined also the\r\ncrowds on shore, the citizens and all others that wished them well. The\r\nhymn sung and the libations finished, they put out to sea, and first\r\nout in column then raced each other as far as Aegina, and so hastened\r\nto reach Corcyra, where the rest of the allied forces were also\r\nassembling.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIX\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventeenth Year of the War—Parties at Syracuse—Story of Harmodius and\r\nAristogiton—Disgrace of Alcibiades\r\n\r\n\r\nMeanwhile at Syracuse news came in from many quarters of the\r\nexpedition, but for a long while met with no credence whatever. Indeed,\r\nan assembly was held in which speeches, as will be seen, were delivered\r\nby different orators, believing or contradicting the report of the\r\nAthenian expedition; among whom Hermocrates, son of Hermon, came\r\nforward, being persuaded that he knew the truth of the matter, and gave\r\nthe following counsel:\r\n\r\n“Although I shall perhaps be no better believed than others have been\r\nwhen I speak upon the reality of the expedition, and although I know\r\nthat those who either make or repeat statements thought not worthy of\r\nbelief not only gain no converts but are thought fools for their pains,\r\nI shall certainly not be frightened into holding my tongue when the\r\nstate is in danger, and when I am persuaded that I can speak with more\r\nauthority on the matter than other persons. Much as you wonder at it,\r\nthe Athenians nevertheless have set out against us with a large force,\r\nnaval and military, professedly to help the Egestaeans and to restore\r\nLeontini, but really to conquer Sicily, and above all our city, which\r\nonce gained, the rest, they think, will easily follow. Make up your\r\nminds, therefore, to see them speedily here, and see how you can best\r\nrepel them with the means under your hand, and do be taken off your\r\nguard through despising the news, or neglect the common weal through\r\ndisbelieving it. Meanwhile those who believe me need not be dismayed at\r\nthe force or daring of the enemy. They will not be able to do us more\r\nhurt than we shall do them; nor is the greatness of their armament\r\naltogether without advantage to us. Indeed, the greater it is the\r\nbetter, with regard to the rest of the Siceliots, whom dismay will make\r\nmore ready to join us; and if we defeat or drive them away,\r\ndisappointed of the objects of their ambition (for I do not fear for a\r\nmoment that they will get what they want), it will be a most glorious\r\nexploit for us, and in my judgment by no means an unlikely one. Few\r\nindeed have been the large armaments, either Hellenic or barbarian,\r\nthat have gone far from home and been successful. They cannot be more\r\nnumerous than the people of the country and their neighbours, all of\r\nwhom fear leagues together; and if they miscarry for want of supplies\r\nin a foreign land, to those against whom their plans were laid none the\r\nless they leave renown, although they may themselves have been the main\r\ncause of their own discomfort. Thus these very Athenians rose by the\r\ndefeat of the Mede, in a great measure due to accidental causes, from\r\nthe mere fact that Athens had been the object of his attack; and this\r\nmay very well be the case with us also.\r\n\r\n“Let us, therefore, confidently begin preparations here; let us send\r\nand confirm some of the Sicels, and obtain the friendship and alliance\r\nof others, and dispatch envoys to the rest of Sicily to show that the\r\ndanger is common to all, and to Italy to get them to become our allies,\r\nor at all events to refuse to receive the Athenians. I also think that\r\nit would be best to send to Carthage as well; they are by no means\r\nthere without apprehension, but it is their constant fear that the\r\nAthenians may one day attack their city, and they may perhaps think\r\nthat they might themselves suffer by letting Sicily be sacrificed, and\r\nbe willing to help us secretly if not openly, in one way if not in\r\nanother. They are the best able to do so, if they will, of any of the\r\npresent day, as they possess most gold and silver, by which war, like\r\neverything else, flourishes. Let us also send to Lacedaemon and\r\nCorinth, and ask them to come here and help us as soon as possible, and\r\nto keep alive the war in Hellas. But the true thing of all others, in\r\nmy opinion, to do at the present moment, is what you, with your\r\nconstitutional love of quiet, will be slow to see, and what I must\r\nnevertheless mention. If we Siceliots, all together, or at least as\r\nmany as possible besides ourselves, would only launch the whole of our\r\nactual navy with two months’ provisions, and meet the Athenians at\r\nTarentum and the Iapygian promontory, and show them that before\r\nfighting for Sicily they must first fight for their passage across the\r\nIonian Sea, we should strike dismay into their army, and set them on\r\nthinking that we have a base for our defensive—for Tarentum is ready to\r\nreceive us—while they have a wide sea to cross with all their armament,\r\nwhich could with difficulty keep its order through so long a voyage,\r\nand would be easy for us to attack as it came on slowly and in small\r\ndetachments. On the other hand, if they were to lighten their vessels,\r\nand draw together their fast sailers and with these attack us, we could\r\neither fall upon them when they were wearied with rowing, or if we did\r\nnot choose to do so, we could retire to Tarentum; while they, having\r\ncrossed with few provisions just to give battle, would be hard put to\r\nit in desolate places, and would either have to remain and be\r\nblockaded, or to try to sail along the coast, abandoning the rest of\r\ntheir armament, and being further discouraged by not knowing for\r\ncertain whether the cities would receive them. In my opinion this\r\nconsideration alone would be sufficient to deter them from putting out\r\nfrom Corcyra; and what with deliberating and reconnoitring our numbers\r\nand whereabouts, they would let the season go on until winter was upon\r\nthem, or, confounded by so unexpected a circumstance, would break up\r\nthe expedition, especially as their most experienced general has, as I\r\nhear, taken the command against his will, and would grasp at the first\r\nexcuse offered by any serious demonstration of ours. We should also be\r\nreported, I am certain, as more numerous than we really are, and men’s\r\nminds are affected by what they hear, and besides the first to attack,\r\nor to show that they mean to defend themselves against an attack,\r\ninspire greater fear because men see that they are ready for the\r\nemergency. This would just be the case with the Athenians at present.\r\nThey are now attacking us in the belief that we shall not resist,\r\nhaving a right to judge us severely because we did not help the\r\nLacedaemonians in crushing them; but if they were to see us showing a\r\ncourage for which they are not prepared, they would be more dismayed by\r\nthe surprise than they could ever be by our actual power. I could wish\r\nto persuade you to show this courage; but if this cannot be, at all\r\nevents lose not a moment in preparing generally for the war; and\r\nremember all of you that contempt for an assailant is best shown by\r\nbravery in action, but that for the present the best course is to\r\naccept the preparations which fear inspires as giving the surest\r\npromise of safety, and to act as if the danger was real. That the\r\nAthenians are coming to attack us, and are already upon the voyage, and\r\nall but here—this is what I am sure of.”\r\n\r\nThus far spoke Hermocrates. Meanwhile the people of Syracuse were at\r\ngreat strife among themselves; some contending that the Athenians had\r\nno idea of coming and that there was no truth in what he said; some\r\nasking if they did come what harm they could do that would not be\r\nrepaid them tenfold in return; while others made light of the whole\r\naffair and turned it into ridicule. In short, there were few that\r\nbelieved Hermocrates and feared for the future. Meanwhile Athenagoras,\r\nthe leader of the people and very powerful at that time with the\r\nmasses, came forward and spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“For the Athenians, he who does not wish that they may be as misguided\r\nas they are supposed to be, and that they may come here to become our\r\nsubjects, is either a coward or a traitor to his country; while as for\r\nthose who carry such tidings and fill you with so much alarm, I wonder\r\nless at their audacity than at their folly if they flatter themselves\r\nthat we do not see through them. The fact is that they have their\r\nprivate reasons to be afraid, and wish to throw the city into\r\nconsternation to have their own terrors cast into the shade by the\r\npublic alarm. In short, this is what these reports are worth; they do\r\nnot arise of themselves, but are concocted by men who are always\r\ncausing agitation here in Sicily. However, if you are well advised, you\r\nwill not be guided in your calculation of probabilities by what these\r\npersons tell you, but by what shrewd men and of large experience, as I\r\nesteem the Athenians to be, would be likely to do. Now it is not likely\r\nthat they would leave the Peloponnesians behind them, and before they\r\nhave well ended the war in Hellas wantonly come in quest of a new war\r\nquite as arduous in Sicily; indeed, in my judgment, they are only too\r\nglad that we do not go and attack them, being so many and so great\r\ncities as we are.\r\n\r\n“However, if they should come as is reported, I consider Sicily better\r\nable to go through with the war than Peloponnese, as being at all\r\npoints better prepared, and our city by itself far more than a match\r\nfor this pretended army of invasion, even were it twice as large again.\r\nI know that they will not have horses with them, or get any here,\r\nexcept a few perhaps from the Egestaeans; or be able to bring a force\r\nof heavy infantry equal in number to our own, in ships which will\r\nalready have enough to do to come all this distance, however lightly\r\nladen, not to speak of the transport of the other stores required\r\nagainst a city of this magnitude, which will be no slight quantity. In\r\nfact, so strong is my opinion upon the subject, that I do not well see\r\nhow they could avoid annihilation if they brought with them another\r\ncity as large as Syracuse, and settled down and carried on war from our\r\nfrontier; much less can they hope to succeed with all Sicily hostile to\r\nthem, as all Sicily will be, and with only a camp pitched from the\r\nships, and composed of tents and bare necessaries, from which they\r\nwould not be able to stir far for fear of our cavalry.\r\n\r\n“But the Athenians see this as I tell you, and as I have reason to know\r\nare looking after their possessions at home, while persons here invent\r\nstories that neither are true nor ever will be. Nor is this the first\r\ntime that I see these persons, when they cannot resort to deeds, trying\r\nby such stories and by others even more abominable to frighten your\r\npeople and get into their hands the government: it is what I see\r\nalways. And I cannot help fearing that trying so often they may one day\r\nsucceed, and that we, as long as we do not feel the smart, may prove\r\ntoo weak for the task of prevention, or, when the offenders are known,\r\nof pursuit. The result is that our city is rarely at rest, but is\r\nsubject to constant troubles and to contests as frequent against\r\nherself as against the enemy, not to speak of occasional tyrannies and\r\ninfamous cabals. However, I will try, if you will support me, to let\r\nnothing of this happen in our time, by gaining you, the many, and by\r\nchastising the authors of such machinations, not merely when they are\r\ncaught in the act—a difficult feat to accomplish—but also for what they\r\nhave the wish though not the power to do; as it is necessary to punish\r\nan enemy not only for what he does, but also beforehand for what he\r\nintends to do, if the first to relax precaution would not be also the\r\nfirst to suffer. I shall also reprove, watch, and on occasion warn the\r\nfew—the most effectual way, in my opinion, of turning them from their\r\nevil courses. And after all, as I have often asked, what would you\r\nhave, young men? Would you hold office at once? The law forbids it, a\r\nlaw enacted rather because you are not competent than to disgrace you\r\nwhen competent. Meanwhile you would not be on a legal equality with the\r\nmany! But how can it be right that citizens of the same state should be\r\nheld unworthy of the same privileges?\r\n\r\n“It will be said, perhaps, that democracy is neither wise nor\r\nequitable, but that the holders of property are also the best fitted to\r\nrule. I say, on the contrary, first, that the word demos, or people,\r\nincludes the whole state, oligarchy only a part; next, that if the best\r\nguardians of property are the rich, and the best counsellors the wise,\r\nnone can hear and decide so well as the many; and that all these\r\ntalents, severally and collectively, have their just place in a\r\ndemocracy. But an oligarchy gives the many their share of the danger,\r\nand not content with the largest part takes and keeps the whole of the\r\nprofit; and this is what the powerful and young among you aspire to,\r\nbut in a great city cannot possibly obtain.\r\n\r\n“But even now, foolish men, most senseless of all the Hellenes that I\r\nknow, if you have no sense of the wickedness of your designs, or most\r\ncriminal if you have that sense and still dare to pursue them—even now,\r\nif it is not a case for repentance, you may still learn wisdom, and\r\nthus advance the interest of the country, the common interest of us\r\nall. Reflect that in the country’s prosperity the men of merit in your\r\nranks will have a share and a larger share than the great mass of your\r\nfellow countrymen, but that if you have other designs you run a risk of\r\nbeing deprived of all; and desist from reports like these, as the\r\npeople know your object and will not put up with it. If the Athenians\r\narrive, this city will repulse them in a manner worthy of itself; we\r\nhave moreover, generals who will see to this matter. And if nothing of\r\nthis be true, as I incline to believe, the city will not be thrown into\r\na panic by your intelligence, or impose upon itself a self-chosen\r\nservitude by choosing you for its rulers; the city itself will look\r\ninto the matter, and will judge your words as if they were acts, and,\r\ninstead of allowing itself to be deprived of its liberty by listening\r\nto you, will strive to preserve that liberty, by taking care to have\r\nalways at hand the means of making itself respected.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Athenagoras. One of the generals now stood up\r\nand stopped any other speakers coming forward, adding these words of\r\nhis own with reference to the matter in hand: “It is not well for\r\nspeakers to utter calumnies against one another, or for their hearers\r\nto entertain them; we ought rather to look to the intelligence that we\r\nhave received, and see how each man by himself and the city as a whole\r\nmay best prepare to repel the invaders. Even if there be no need, there\r\nis no harm in the state being furnished with horses and arms and all\r\nother insignia of war; and we will undertake to see to and order this,\r\nand to send round to the cities to reconnoitre and do all else that may\r\nappear desirable. Part of this we have seen to already, and whatever we\r\ndiscover shall be laid before you.” After these words from the general,\r\nthe Syracusans departed from the assembly.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Athenians with all their allies had now arrived at\r\nCorcyra. Here the generals began by again reviewing the armament, and\r\nmade arrangements as to the order in which they were to anchor and\r\nencamp, and dividing the whole fleet into three divisions, allotted one\r\nto each of their number, to avoid sailing all together and being thus\r\nembarrassed for water, harbourage, or provisions at the stations which\r\nthey might touch at, and at the same time to be generally better\r\nordered and easier to handle, by each squadron having its own\r\ncommander. Next they sent on three ships to Italy and Sicily to find\r\nout which of the cities would receive them, with instructions to meet\r\nthem on the way and let them know before they put in to land.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Athenians weighed from Corcyra, and proceeded to cross\r\nto Sicily with an armament now consisting of one hundred and\r\nthirty-four galleys in all (besides two Rhodian fifty-oars), of which\r\none hundred were Athenian vessels—sixty men-of-war, and forty\r\ntroopships—and the remainder from Chios and the other allies; five\r\nthousand and one hundred heavy infantry in all, that is to say, fifteen\r\nhundred Athenian citizens from the rolls at Athens and seven hundred\r\nThetes shipped as marines, and the rest allied troops, some of them\r\nAthenian subjects, and besides these five hundred Argives, and two\r\nhundred and fifty Mantineans serving for hire; four hundred and eighty\r\narchers in all, eighty of whom were Cretans, seven hundred slingers\r\nfrom Rhodes, one hundred and twenty light-armed exiles from Megara, and\r\none horse-transport carrying thirty horses.\r\n\r\nSuch was the strength of the first armament that sailed over for the\r\nwar. The supplies for this force were carried by thirty ships of burden\r\nladen with corn, which conveyed the bakers, stone-masons, and\r\ncarpenters, and the tools for raising fortifications, accompanied by\r\none hundred boats, like the former pressed into the service, besides\r\nmany other boats and ships of burden which followed the armament\r\nvoluntarily for purposes of trade; all of which now left Corcyra and\r\nstruck across the Ionian Sea together. The whole force making land at\r\nthe Iapygian promontory and Tarentum, with more or less good fortune,\r\ncoasted along the shores of Italy, the cities shutting their markets\r\nand gates against them, and according them nothing but water and\r\nliberty to anchor, and Tarentum and Locri not even that, until they\r\narrived at Rhegium, the extreme point of Italy. Here at length they\r\nreunited, and not gaining admission within the walls pitched a camp\r\noutside the city in the precinct of Artemis, where a market was also\r\nprovided for them, and drew their ships on shore and kept quiet.\r\nMeanwhile they opened negotiations with the Rhegians, and called upon\r\nthem as Chalcidians to assist their Leontine kinsmen; to which the\r\nRhegians replied that they would not side with either party, but should\r\nawait the decision of the rest of the Italiots, and do as they did.\r\nUpon this the Athenians now began to consider what would be the best\r\naction to take in the affairs of Sicily, and meanwhile waited for the\r\nships sent on to come back from Egesta, in order to know whether there\r\nwas really there the money mentioned by the messengers at Athens.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime came in from all quarters to the Syracusans, as well as\r\nfrom their own officers sent to reconnoitre, the positive tidings that\r\nthe fleet was at Rhegium; upon which they laid aside their incredulity\r\nand threw themselves heart and soul into the work of preparation.\r\nGuards or envoys, as the case might be, were sent round to the Sicels,\r\ngarrisons put into the posts of the Peripoli in the country, horses and\r\narms reviewed in the city to see that nothing was wanting, and all\r\nother steps taken to prepare for a war which might be upon them at any\r\nmoment.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the three ships that had been sent on came from Egesta to the\r\nAthenians at Rhegium, with the news that so far from there being the\r\nsums promised, all that could be produced was thirty talents. The\r\ngenerals were not a little disheartened at being thus disappointed at\r\nthe outset, and by the refusal to join in the expedition of the\r\nRhegians, the people they had first tried to gain and had had had most\r\nreason to count upon, from their relationship to the Leontines and\r\nconstant friendship for Athens. If Nicias was prepared for the news\r\nfrom Egesta, his two colleagues were taken completely by surprise. The\r\nEgestaeans had had recourse to the following stratagem, when the first\r\nenvoys from Athens came to inspect their resources. They took the\r\nenvoys in question to the temple of Aphrodite at Eryx and showed them\r\nthe treasures deposited there: bowls, wine-ladles, censers, and a large\r\nnumber of other pieces of plate, which from being in silver gave an\r\nimpression of wealth quite out of proportion to their really small\r\nvalue. They also privately entertained the ships’ crews, and collected\r\nall the cups of gold and silver that they could find in Egesta itself\r\nor could borrow in the neighbouring Phoenician and Hellenic towns, and\r\neach brought them to the banquets as their own; and as all used pretty\r\nnearly the same, and everywhere a great quantity of plate was shown,\r\nthe effect was most dazzling upon the Athenian sailors, and made them\r\ntalk loudly of the riches they had seen when they got back to Athens.\r\nThe dupes in question—who had in their turn persuaded the rest—when the\r\nnews got abroad that there was not the money supposed at Egesta, were\r\nmuch blamed by the soldiers.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the generals consulted upon what was to be done. The opinion\r\nof Nicias was to sail with all the armament to Selinus, the main object\r\nof the expedition, and if the Egestaeans could provide money for the\r\nwhole force, to advise accordingly; but if they could not, to require\r\nthem to supply provisions for the sixty ships that they had asked for,\r\nto stay and settle matters between them and the Selinuntines either by\r\nforce or by agreement, and then to coast past the other cities, and\r\nafter displaying the power of Athens and proving their zeal for their\r\nfriends and allies, to sail home again (unless they should have some\r\nsudden and unexpected opportunity of serving the Leontines, or of\r\nbringing over some of the other cities), and not to endanger the state\r\nby wasting its home resources.\r\n\r\nAlcibiades said that a great expedition like the present must not\r\ndisgrace itself by going away without having done anything; heralds\r\nmust be sent to all the cities except Selinus and Syracuse, and efforts\r\nbe made to make some of the Sicels revolt from the Syracusans, and to\r\nobtain the friendship of others, in order to have corn and troops; and\r\nfirst of all to gain the Messinese, who lay right in the passage and\r\nentrance to Sicily, and would afford an excellent harbour and base for\r\nthe army. Thus, after bringing over the towns and knowing who would be\r\ntheir allies in the war, they might at length attack Syracuse and\r\nSelinus; unless the latter came to terms with Egesta and the former\r\nceased to oppose the restoration of Leontini.\r\n\r\nLamachus, on the other hand, said that they ought to sail straight to\r\nSyracuse, and fight their battle at once under the walls of the town\r\nwhile the people were still unprepared, and the panic at its height.\r\nEvery armament was most terrible at first; if it allowed time to run on\r\nwithout showing itself, men’s courage revived, and they saw it appear\r\nat last almost with indifference. By attacking suddenly, while Syracuse\r\nstill trembled at their coming, they would have the best chance of\r\ngaining a victory for themselves and of striking a complete panic into\r\nthe enemy by the aspect of their numbers—which would never appear so\r\nconsiderable as at present—by the anticipation of coming disaster, and\r\nabove all by the immediate danger of the engagement. They might also\r\ncount upon surprising many in the fields outside, incredulous of their\r\ncoming; and at the moment that the enemy was carrying in his property\r\nthe army would not want for booty if it sat down in force before the\r\ncity. The rest of the Siceliots would thus be immediately less disposed\r\nto enter into alliance with the Syracusans, and would join the\r\nAthenians, without waiting to see which were the strongest. They must\r\nmake Megara their naval station as a place to retreat to and a base\r\nfrom which to attack: it was an uninhabited place at no great distance\r\nfrom Syracuse either by land or by sea.\r\n\r\nAfter speaking to this effect, Lamachus nevertheless gave his support\r\nto the opinion of Alcibiades. After this Alcibiades sailed in his own\r\nvessel across to Messina with proposals of alliance, but met with no\r\nsuccess, the inhabitants answering that they could not receive him\r\nwithin their walls, though they would provide him with a market\r\noutside. Upon this he sailed back to Rhegium. Immediately upon his\r\nreturn the generals manned and victualled sixty ships out of the whole\r\nfleet and coasted along to Naxos, leaving the rest of the armament\r\nbehind them at Rhegium with one of their number. Received by the\r\nNaxians, they then coasted on to Catana, and being refused admittance\r\nby the inhabitants, there being a Syracusan party in the town, went on\r\nto the river Terias. Here they bivouacked, and the next day sailed in\r\nsingle file to Syracuse with all their ships except ten which they sent\r\non in front to sail into the great harbour and see if there was any\r\nfleet launched, and to proclaim by herald from shipboard that the\r\nAthenians were come to restore the Leontines to their country, as being\r\ntheir allies and kinsmen, and that such of them, therefore, as were in\r\nSyracuse should leave it without fear and join their friends and\r\nbenefactors the Athenians. After making this proclamation and\r\nreconnoitring the city and the harbours, and the features of the\r\ncountry which they would have to make their base of operations in the\r\nwar, they sailed back to Catana.\r\n\r\nAn assembly being held here, the inhabitants refused to receive the\r\narmament, but invited the generals to come in and say what they\r\ndesired; and while Alcibiades was speaking and the citizens were intent\r\non the assembly, the soldiers broke down an ill-walled-up postern gate\r\nwithout being observed, and getting inside the town, flocked into the\r\nmarketplace. The Syracusan party in the town no sooner saw the army\r\ninside than they became frightened and withdrew, not being at all\r\nnumerous; while the rest voted for an alliance with the Athenians and\r\ninvited them to fetch the rest of their forces from Rhegium. After this\r\nthe Athenians sailed to Rhegium, and put off, this time with all the\r\narmament, for Catana, and fell to work at their camp immediately upon\r\ntheir arrival.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile word was brought them from Camarina that if they went there\r\nthe town would go over to them, and also that the Syracusans were\r\nmanning a fleet. The Athenians accordingly sailed alongshore with all\r\ntheir armament, first to Syracuse, where they found no fleet manning,\r\nand so always along the coast to Camarina, where they brought to at the\r\nbeach, and sent a herald to the people, who, however, refused to\r\nreceive them, saying that their oaths bound them to receive the\r\nAthenians only with a single vessel, unless they themselves sent for\r\nmore. Disappointed here, the Athenians now sailed back again, and after\r\nlanding and plundering on Syracusan territory and losing some\r\nstragglers from their light infantry through the coming up of the\r\nSyracusan horse, so got back to Catana.\r\n\r\nThere they found the Salaminia come from Athens for Alcibiades, with\r\norders for him to sail home to answer the charges which the state\r\nbrought against him, and for certain others of the soldiers who with\r\nhim were accused of sacrilege in the matter of the mysteries and of the\r\nHermae. For the Athenians, after the departure of the expedition, had\r\ncontinued as active as ever in investigating the facts of the mysteries\r\nand of the Hermae, and, instead of testing the informers, in their\r\nsuspicious temper welcomed all indifferently, arresting and imprisoning\r\nthe best citizens upon the evidence of rascals, and preferring to sift\r\nthe matter to the bottom sooner than to let an accused person of good\r\ncharacter pass unquestioned, owing to the rascality of the informer.\r\nThe commons had heard how oppressive the tyranny of Pisistratus and his\r\nsons had become before it ended, and further that that had been put\r\ndown at last, not by themselves and Harmodius, but by the\r\nLacedaemonians, and so were always in fear and took everything\r\nsuspiciously.\r\n\r\nIndeed, the daring action of Aristogiton and Harmodius was undertaken\r\nin consequence of a love affair, which I shall relate at some length,\r\nto show that the Athenians are not more accurate than the rest of the\r\nworld in their accounts of their own tyrants and of the facts of their\r\nown history. Pisistratus dying at an advanced age in possession of the\r\ntyranny, was succeeded by his eldest son, Hippias, and not Hipparchus,\r\nas is vulgarly believed. Harmodius was then in the flower of youthful\r\nbeauty, and Aristogiton, a citizen in the middle rank of life, was his\r\nlover and possessed him. Solicited without success by Hipparchus, son\r\nof Pisistratus, Harmodius told Aristogiton, and the enraged lover,\r\nafraid that the powerful Hipparchus might take Harmodius by force,\r\nimmediately formed a design, such as his condition in life permitted,\r\nfor overthrowing the tyranny. In the meantime Hipparchus, after a\r\nsecond solicitation of Harmodius, attended with no better success,\r\nunwilling to use violence, arranged to insult him in some covert way.\r\nIndeed, generally their government was not grievous to the multitude,\r\nor in any way odious in practice; and these tyrants cultivated wisdom\r\nand virtue as much as any, and without exacting from the Athenians more\r\nthan a twentieth of their income, splendidly adorned their city, and\r\ncarried on their wars, and provided sacrifices for the temples. For the\r\nrest, the city was left in full enjoyment of its existing laws, except\r\nthat care was always taken to have the offices in the hands of some one\r\nof the family. Among those of them that held the yearly archonship at\r\nAthens was Pisistratus, son of the tyrant Hippias, and named after his\r\ngrandfather, who dedicated during his term of office the altar to the\r\ntwelve gods in the market-place, and that of Apollo in the Pythian\r\nprecinct. The Athenian people afterwards built on to and lengthened the\r\naltar in the market-place, and obliterated the inscription; but that in\r\nthe Pythian precinct can still be seen, though in faded letters, and is\r\nto the following effect:\r\n\r\nPisistratus, the son of Hippias, Sent up this record of his archonship\r\nIn precinct of Apollo Pythias.\r\n\r\nThat Hippias was the eldest son and succeeded to the government, is\r\nwhat I positively assert as a fact upon which I have had more exact\r\naccounts than others, and may be also ascertained by the following\r\ncircumstance. He is the only one of the legitimate brothers that\r\nappears to have had children; as the altar shows, and the pillar placed\r\nin the Athenian Acropolis, commemorating the crime of the tyrants,\r\nwhich mentions no child of Thessalus or of Hipparchus, but five of\r\nHippias, which he had by Myrrhine, daughter of Callias, son of\r\nHyperechides; and naturally the eldest would have married first. Again,\r\nhis name comes first on the pillar after that of his father; and this\r\ntoo is quite natural, as he was the eldest after him, and the reigning\r\ntyrant. Nor can I ever believe that Hippias would have obtained the\r\ntyranny so easily, if Hipparchus had been in power when he was killed,\r\nand he, Hippias, had had to establish himself upon the same day; but he\r\nhad no doubt been long accustomed to overawe the citizens, and to be\r\nobeyed by his mercenaries, and thus not only conquered, but conquered\r\nwith ease, without experiencing any of the embarrassment of a younger\r\nbrother unused to the exercise of authority. It was the sad fate which\r\nmade Hipparchus famous that got him also the credit with posterity of\r\nhaving been tyrant.\r\n\r\nTo return to Harmodius; Hipparchus having been repulsed in his\r\nsolicitations insulted him as he had resolved, by first inviting a\r\nsister of his, a young girl, to come and bear a basket in a certain\r\nprocession, and then rejecting her, on the plea that she had never been\r\ninvited at all owing to her unworthiness. If Harmodius was indignant at\r\nthis, Aristogiton for his sake now became more exasperated than ever;\r\nand having arranged everything with those who were to join them in the\r\nenterprise, they only waited for the great feast of the Panathenaea,\r\nthe sole day upon which the citizens forming part of the procession\r\ncould meet together in arms without suspicion. Aristogiton and\r\nHarmodius were to begin, but were to be supported immediately by their\r\naccomplices against the bodyguard. The conspirators were not many, for\r\nbetter security, besides which they hoped that those not in the plot\r\nwould be carried away by the example of a few daring spirits, and use\r\nthe arms in their hands to recover their liberty.\r\n\r\nAt last the festival arrived; and Hippias with his bodyguard was\r\noutside the city in the Ceramicus, arranging how the different parts of\r\nthe procession were to proceed. Harmodius and Aristogiton had already\r\ntheir daggers and were getting ready to act, when seeing one of their\r\naccomplices talking familiarly with Hippias, who was easy of access to\r\nevery one, they took fright, and concluded that they were discovered\r\nand on the point of being taken; and eager if possible to be revenged\r\nfirst upon the man who had wronged them and for whom they had\r\nundertaken all this risk, they rushed, as they were, within the gates,\r\nand meeting with Hipparchus by the Leocorium recklessly fell upon him\r\nat once, infuriated, Aristogiton by love, and Harmodius by insult, and\r\nsmote him and slew him. Aristogiton escaped the guards at the moment,\r\nthrough the crowd running up, but was afterwards taken and dispatched\r\nin no merciful way: Harmodius was killed on the spot.\r\n\r\nWhen the news was brought to Hippias in the Ceramicus, he at once\r\nproceeded not to the scene of action, but to the armed men in the\r\nprocession, before they, being some distance away, knew anything of the\r\nmatter, and composing his features for the occasion, so as not to\r\nbetray himself, pointed to a certain spot, and bade them repair thither\r\nwithout their arms. They withdrew accordingly, fancying he had\r\nsomething to say; upon which he told the mercenaries to remove the\r\narms, and there and then picked out the men he thought guilty and all\r\nfound with daggers, the shield and spear being the usual weapons for a\r\nprocession.\r\n\r\nIn this way offended love first led Harmodius and Aristogiton to\r\nconspire, and the alarm of the moment to commit the rash action\r\nrecounted. After this the tyranny pressed harder on the Athenians, and\r\nHippias, now grown more fearful, put to death many of the citizens, and\r\nat the same time began to turn his eyes abroad for a refuge in case of\r\nrevolution. Thus, although an Athenian, he gave his daughter,\r\nArchedice, to a Lampsacene, Aeantides, son of the tyrant of Lampsacus,\r\nseeing that they had great influence with Darius. And there is her tomb\r\nin Lampsacus with this inscription:\r\n\r\nArchedice lies buried in this earth, Hippias her sire, and Athens gave\r\nher birth; Unto her bosom pride was never known, Though daughter, wife,\r\nand sister to the throne.\r\n\r\nHippias, after reigning three years longer over the Athenians, was\r\ndeposed in the fourth by the Lacedaemonians and the banished\r\nAlcmaeonidae, and went with a safe conduct to Sigeum, and to Aeantides\r\nat Lampsacus, and from thence to King Darius; from whose court he set\r\nout twenty years after, in his old age, and came with the Medes to\r\nMarathon.\r\n\r\nWith these events in their minds, and recalling everything they knew by\r\nhearsay on the subject, the Athenian people grow difficult of humour\r\nand suspicious of the persons charged in the affair of the mysteries,\r\nand persuaded that all that had taken place was part of an oligarchical\r\nand monarchical conspiracy. In the state of irritation thus produced,\r\nmany persons of consideration had been already thrown into prison, and\r\nfar from showing any signs of abating, public feeling grew daily more\r\nsavage, and more arrests were made; until at last one of those in\r\ncustody, thought to be the most guilty of all, was induced by a fellow\r\nprisoner to make a revelation, whether true or not is a matter on which\r\nthere are two opinions, no one having been able, either then or since,\r\nto say for certain who did the deed. However this may be, the other\r\nfound arguments to persuade him, that even if he had not done it, he\r\nought to save himself by gaining a promise of impunity, and free the\r\nstate of its present suspicions; as he would be surer of safety if he\r\nconfessed after promise of impunity than if he denied and were brought\r\nto trial. He accordingly made a revelation, affecting himself and\r\nothers in the affair of the Hermae; and the Athenian people, glad at\r\nlast, as they supposed, to get at the truth, and furious until then at\r\nnot being able to discover those who had conspired against the commons,\r\nat once let go the informer and all the rest whom he had not denounced,\r\nand bringing the accused to trial executed as many as were apprehended,\r\nand condemned to death such as had fled and set a price upon their\r\nheads. In this it was, after all, not clear whether the sufferers had\r\nbeen punished unjustly, while in any case the rest of the city received\r\nimmediate and manifest relief.\r\n\r\nTo return to Alcibiades: public feeling was very hostile to him, being\r\nworked on by the same enemies who had attacked him before he went out;\r\nand now that the Athenians fancied that they had got at the truth of\r\nthe matter of the Hermae, they believed more firmly than ever that the\r\naffair of the mysteries also, in which he was implicated, had been\r\ncontrived by him in the same intention and was connected with the plot\r\nagainst the democracy. Meanwhile it so happened that, just at the time\r\nof this agitation, a small force of Lacedaemonians had advanced as far\r\nas the Isthmus, in pursuance of some scheme with the Boeotians. It was\r\nnow thought that this had come by appointment, at his instigation, and\r\nnot on account of the Boeotians, and that, if the citizens had not\r\nacted on the information received, and forestalled them by arresting\r\nthe prisoners, the city would have been betrayed. The citizens went so\r\nfar as to sleep one night armed in the temple of Theseus within the\r\nwalls. The friends also of Alcibiades at Argos were just at this time\r\nsuspected of a design to attack the commons; and the Argive hostages\r\ndeposited in the islands were given up by the Athenians to the Argive\r\npeople to be put to death upon that account: in short, everywhere\r\nsomething was found to create suspicion against Alcibiades. It was\r\ntherefore decided to bring him to trial and execute him, and the\r\nSalaminia was sent to Sicily for him and the others named in the\r\ninformation, with instructions to order him to come and answer the\r\ncharges against him, but not to arrest him, because they wished to\r\navoid causing any agitation in the army or among the enemy in Sicily,\r\nand above all to retain the services of the Mantineans and Argives,\r\nwho, it was thought, had been induced to join by his influence.\r\nAlcibiades, with his own ship and his fellow accused, accordingly\r\nsailed off with the Salaminia from Sicily, as though to return to\r\nAthens, and went with her as far as Thurii, and there they left the\r\nship and disappeared, being afraid to go home for trial with such a\r\nprejudice existing against them. The crew of the Salaminia stayed some\r\ntime looking for Alcibiades and his companions, and at length, as they\r\nwere nowhere to be found, set sail and departed. Alcibiades, now an\r\noutlaw, crossed in a boat not long after from Thurii to Peloponnese;\r\nand the Athenians passed sentence of death by default upon him and\r\nthose in his company.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX\r\n\r\n\r\nSeventeenth and Eighteenth Years of the War—Inaction of the Athenian\r\nArmy—Alcibiades at Sparta—Investment of Syracuse\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Athenian generals left in Sicily now divided the armament into two\r\nparts, and, each taking one by lot, sailed with the whole for Selinus\r\nand Egesta, wishing to know whether the Egestaeans would give the\r\nmoney, and to look into the question of Selinus and ascertain the state\r\nof the quarrel between her and Egesta. Coasting along Sicily, with the\r\nshore on their left, on the side towards the Tyrrhene Gulf they touched\r\nat Himera, the only Hellenic city in that part of the island, and being\r\nrefused admission resumed their voyage. On their way they took Hyccara,\r\na petty Sicanian seaport, nevertheless at war with Egesta, and making\r\nslaves of the inhabitants gave up the town to the Egestaeans, some of\r\nwhose horse had joined them; after which the army proceeded through the\r\nterritory of the Sicels until it reached Catana, while the fleet sailed\r\nalong the coast with the slaves on board. Meanwhile Nicias sailed\r\nstraight from Hyccara along the coast and went to Egesta and, after\r\ntransacting his other business and receiving thirty talents, rejoined\r\nthe forces. They now sold their slaves for the sum of one hundred and\r\ntwenty talents, and sailed round to their Sicel allies to urge them to\r\nsend troops; and meanwhile went with half their own force to the\r\nhostile town of Hybla in the territory of Gela, but did not succeed in\r\ntaking it.\r\n\r\nSummer was now over. The winter following, the Athenians at once began\r\nto prepare for moving on Syracuse, and the Syracusans on their side for\r\nmarching against them. From the moment when the Athenians failed to\r\nattack them instantly as they at first feared and expected, every day\r\nthat passed did something to revive their courage; and when they saw\r\nthem sailing far away from them on the other side of Sicily, and going\r\nto Hybla only to fail in their attempts to storm it, they thought less\r\nof them than ever, and called upon their generals, as the multitude is\r\napt to do in its moments of confidence, to lead them to Catana, since\r\nthe enemy would not come to them. Parties also of the Syracusan horse\r\nemployed in reconnoitring constantly rode up to the Athenian armament,\r\nand among other insults asked them whether they had not really come to\r\nsettle with the Syracusans in a foreign country rather than to resettle\r\nthe Leontines in their own.\r\n\r\nAware of this, the Athenian generals determined to draw them out in\r\nmass as far as possible from the city, and themselves in the meantime\r\nto sail by night alongshore, and take up at their leisure a convenient\r\nposition. This they knew they could not so well do, if they had to\r\ndisembark from their ships in front of a force prepared for them, or to\r\ngo by land openly. The numerous cavalry of the Syracusans (a force\r\nwhich they were themselves without) would then be able to do the\r\ngreatest mischief to their light troops and the crowd that followed\r\nthem; but this plan would enable them to take up a position in which\r\nthe horse could do them no hurt worth speaking of, some Syracusan\r\nexiles with the army having told them of the spot near the Olympieum,\r\nwhich they afterwards occupied. In pursuance of their idea, the\r\ngenerals imagined the following stratagem. They sent to Syracuse a man\r\ndevoted to them, and by the Syracusan generals thought to be no less in\r\ntheir interest; he was a native of Catana, and said he came from\r\npersons in that place, whose names the Syracusan generals were\r\nacquainted with, and whom they knew to be among the members of their\r\nparty still left in the city. He told them that the Athenians passed\r\nthe night in the town, at some distance from their arms, and that if\r\nthe Syracusans would name a day and come with all their people at\r\ndaybreak to attack the armament, they, their friends, would close the\r\ngates upon the troops in the city, and set fire to the vessels, while\r\nthe Syracusans would easily take the camp by an attack upon the\r\nstockade. In this they would be aided by many of the Catanians, who\r\nwere already prepared to act, and from whom he himself came.\r\n\r\nThe generals of the Syracusans, who did not want confidence, and who\r\nhad intended even without this to march on Catana, believed the man\r\nwithout any sufficient inquiry, fixed at once a day upon which they\r\nwould be there, and dismissed him, and the Selinuntines and others of\r\ntheir allies having now arrived, gave orders for all the Syracusans to\r\nmarch out in mass. Their preparations completed, and the time fixed for\r\ntheir arrival being at hand, they set out for Catana, and passed the\r\nnight upon the river Symaethus, in the Leontine territory. Meanwhile\r\nthe Athenians no sooner knew of their approach than they took all their\r\nforces and such of the Sicels or others as had joined them, put them on\r\nboard their ships and boats, and sailed by night to Syracuse. Thus,\r\nwhen morning broke the Athenians were landing opposite the Olympieum\r\nready to seize their camping ground, and the Syracusan horse having\r\nridden up first to Catana and found that all the armament had put to\r\nsea, turned back and told the infantry, and then all turned back\r\ntogether, and went to the relief of the city.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, as the march before the Syracusans was a long one, the\r\nAthenians quietly sat down their army in a convenient position, where\r\nthey could begin an engagement when they pleased, and where the\r\nSyracusan cavalry would have least opportunity of annoying them, either\r\nbefore or during the action, being fenced off on one side by walls,\r\nhouses, trees, and by a marsh, and on the other by cliffs. They also\r\nfelled the neighbouring trees and carried them down to the sea, and\r\nformed a palisade alongside of their ships, and with stones which they\r\npicked up and wood hastily raised a fort at Daskon, the most vulnerable\r\npoint of their position, and broke down the bridge over the Anapus.\r\nThese preparations were allowed to go on without any interruption from\r\nthe city, the first hostile force to appear being the Syracusan\r\ncavalry, followed afterwards by all the foot together. At first they\r\ncame close up to the Athenian army, and then, finding that they did not\r\noffer to engage, crossed the Helorine road and encamped for the night.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Athenians and their allies prepared for battle, their\r\ndispositions being as follows: Their right wing was occupied by the\r\nArgives and Mantineans, the centre by the Athenians, and the rest of\r\nthe field by the other allies. Half their army was drawn up eight deep\r\nin advance, half close to their tents in a hollow square, formed also\r\neight deep, which had orders to look out and be ready to go to the\r\nsupport of the troops hardest pressed. The camp followers were placed\r\ninside this reserve. The Syracusans, meanwhile, formed their heavy\r\ninfantry sixteen deep, consisting of the mass levy of their own people,\r\nand such allies as had joined them, the strongest contingent being that\r\nof the Selinuntines; next to them the cavalry of the Geloans, numbering\r\ntwo hundred in all, with about twenty horse and fifty archers from\r\nCamarina. The cavalry was posted on their right, full twelve hundred\r\nstrong, and next to it the darters. As the Athenians were about to\r\nbegin the attack, Nicias went along the lines, and addressed these\r\nwords of encouragement to the army and the nations composing it:\r\n\r\n“Soldiers, a long exhortation is little needed by men like ourselves,\r\nwho are here to fight in the same battle, the force itself being, to my\r\nthinking, more fit to inspire confidence than a fine speech with a weak\r\narmy. Where we have Argives, Mantineans, Athenians, and the first of\r\nthe islanders in the ranks together, it were strange indeed, with so\r\nmany and so brave companions in arms, if we did not feel confident of\r\nvictory; especially when we have mass levies opposed to our picked\r\ntroops, and what is more, Siceliots, who may disdain us but will not\r\nstand against us, their skill not being at all commensurate to their\r\nrashness. You may also remember that we are far from home and have no\r\nfriendly land near, except what your own swords shall win you; and here\r\nI put before you a motive just the reverse of that which the enemy are\r\nappealing to; their cry being that they shall fight for their country,\r\nmine that we shall fight for a country that is not ours, where we must\r\nconquer or hardly get away, as we shall have their horse upon us in\r\ngreat numbers. Remember, therefore, your renown, and go boldly against\r\nthe enemy, thinking the present strait and necessity more terrible than\r\nthey.”\r\n\r\nAfter this address Nicias at once led on the army. The Syracusans were\r\nnot at that moment expecting an immediate engagement, and some had even\r\ngone away to the town, which was close by; these now ran up as hard as\r\nthey could and, though behind time, took their places here or there in\r\nthe main body as fast as they joined it. Want of zeal or daring was\r\ncertainly not the fault of the Syracusans, either in this or the other\r\nbattles, but although not inferior in courage, so far as their military\r\nscience might carry them, when this failed them they were compelled to\r\ngive up their resolution also. On the present occasion, although they\r\nhad not supposed that the Athenians would begin the attack, and\r\nalthough constrained to stand upon their defence at short notice, they\r\nat once took up their arms and advanced to meet them. First, the\r\nstone-throwers, slingers, and archers of either army began skirmishing,\r\nand routed or were routed by one another, as might be expected between\r\nlight troops; next, soothsayers brought forward the usual victims, and\r\ntrumpeters urged on the heavy infantry to the charge; and thus they\r\nadvanced, the Syracusans to fight for their country, and each\r\nindividual for his safety that day and liberty hereafter; in the\r\nenemy’s army, the Athenians to make another’s country theirs and to\r\nsave their own from suffering by their defeat; the Argives and\r\nindependent allies to help them in getting what they came for, and to\r\nearn by victory another sight of the country they had left behind;\r\nwhile the subject allies owed most of their ardour to the desire of\r\nself-preservation, which they could only hope for if victorious; next\r\nto which, as a secondary motive, came the chance of serving on easier\r\nterms, after helping the Athenians to a fresh conquest.\r\n\r\nThe armies now came to close quarters, and for a long while fought\r\nwithout either giving ground. Meanwhile there occurred some claps of\r\nthunder with lightning and heavy rain, which did not fail to add to the\r\nfears of the party fighting for the first time, and very little\r\nacquainted with war; while to their more experienced adversaries these\r\nphenomena appeared to be produced by the time of year, and much more\r\nalarm was felt at the continued resistance of the enemy. At last the\r\nArgives drove in the Syracusan left, and after them the Athenians\r\nrouted the troops opposed to them, and the Syracusan army was thus cut\r\nin two and betook itself to flight. The Athenians did not pursue far,\r\nbeing held in check by the numerous and undefeated Syracusan horse, who\r\nattacked and drove back any of their heavy infantry whom they saw\r\npursuing in advance of the rest; in spite of which the victors followed\r\nso far as was safe in a body, and then went back and set up a trophy.\r\nMeanwhile the Syracusans rallied at the Helorine road, where they\r\nre-formed as well as they could under the circumstances, and even sent\r\na garrison of their own citizens to the Olympieum, fearing that the\r\nAthenians might lay hands on some of the treasures there. The rest\r\nreturned to the town.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, however, did not go to the temple, but collected their\r\ndead and laid them upon a pyre, and passed the night upon the field.\r\nThe next day they gave the enemy back their dead under truce, to the\r\nnumber of about two hundred and sixty, Syracusans and allies, and\r\ngathered together the bones of their own, some fifty, Athenians and\r\nallies, and taking the spoils of the enemy, sailed back to Catana. It\r\nwas now winter; and it did not seem possible for the moment to carry on\r\nthe war before Syracuse, until horse should have been sent for from\r\nAthens and levied among the allies in Sicily—to do away with their\r\nutter inferiority in cavalry—and money should have been collected in\r\nthe country and received from Athens, and until some of the cities,\r\nwhich they hoped would be now more disposed to listen to them after the\r\nbattle, should have been brought over, and corn and all other\r\nnecessaries provided, for a campaign in the spring against Syracuse.\r\n\r\nWith this intention they sailed off to Naxos and Catana for the winter.\r\nMeanwhile the Syracusans burned their dead and then held an assembly,\r\nin which Hermocrates, son of Hermon, a man who with a general ability\r\nof the first order had given proofs of military capacity and brilliant\r\ncourage in the war, came forward and encouraged them, and told them not\r\nto let what had occurred make them give way, since their spirit had not\r\nbeen conquered, but their want of discipline had done the mischief.\r\nStill they had not been beaten by so much as might have been expected,\r\nespecially as they were, one might say, novices in the art of war, an\r\narmy of artisans opposed to the most practised soldiers in Hellas. What\r\nhad also done great mischief was the number of the generals (there were\r\nfifteen of them) and the quantity of orders given, combined with the\r\ndisorder and insubordination of the troops. But if they were to have a\r\nfew skilful generals, and used this winter in preparing their heavy\r\ninfantry, finding arms for such as had not got any, so as to make them\r\nas numerous as possible, and forcing them to attend to their training\r\ngenerally, they would have every chance of beating their adversaries,\r\ncourage being already theirs and discipline in the field having thus\r\nbeen added to it. Indeed, both these qualities would improve, since\r\ndanger would exercise them in discipline, while their courage would be\r\nled to surpass itself by the confidence which skill inspires. The\r\ngenerals should be few and elected with full powers, and an oath should\r\nbe taken to leave them entire discretion in their command: if they\r\nadopted this plan, their secrets would be better kept, all preparations\r\nwould be properly made, and there would be no room for excuses.\r\n\r\nThe Syracusans heard him, and voted everything as he advised, and\r\nelected three generals, Hermocrates himself, Heraclides, son of\r\nLysimachus, and Sicanus, son of Execestes. They also sent envoys to\r\nCorinth and Lacedaemon to procure a force of allies to join them, and\r\nto induce the Lacedaemonians for their sakes openly to address\r\nthemselves in real earnest to the war against the Athenians, that they\r\nmight either have to leave Sicily or be less able to send\r\nreinforcements to their army there.\r\n\r\nThe Athenian forces at Catana now at once sailed against Messina, in\r\nthe expectation of its being betrayed to them. The intrigue, however,\r\nafter all came to nothing: Alcibiades, who was in the secret, when he\r\nleft his command upon the summons from home, foreseeing that he would\r\nbe outlawed, gave information of the plot to the friends of the\r\nSyracusans in Messina, who had at once put to death its authors, and\r\nnow rose in arms against the opposite faction with those of their way\r\nof thinking, and succeeded in preventing the admission of the\r\nAthenians. The latter waited for thirteen days, and then, as they were\r\nexposed to the weather and without provisions, and met with no success,\r\nwent back to Naxos, where they made places for their ships to lie in,\r\nerected a palisade round their camp, and retired into winter quarters;\r\nmeanwhile they sent a galley to Athens for money and cavalry to join\r\nthem in the spring. During the winter the Syracusans built a wall on to\r\nthe city, so as to take in the statue of Apollo Temenites, all along\r\nthe side looking towards Epipolae, to make the task of circumvallation\r\nlonger and more difficult, in case of their being defeated, and also\r\nerected a fort at Megara and another in the Olympieum, and stuck\r\npalisades along the sea wherever there was a landing Place. Meanwhile,\r\nas they knew that the Athenians were wintering at Naxos, they marched\r\nwith all their people to Catana, and ravaged the land and set fire to\r\nthe tents and encampment of the Athenians, and so returned home.\r\nLearning also that the Athenians were sending an embassy to Camarina,\r\non the strength of the alliance concluded in the time of Laches, to\r\ngain, if possible, that city, they sent another from Syracuse to oppose\r\nthem. They had a shrewd suspicion that the Camarinaeans had not sent\r\nwhat they did send for the first battle very willingly; and they now\r\nfeared that they would refuse to assist them at all in future, after\r\nseeing the success of the Athenians in the action, and would join the\r\nlatter on the strength of their old friendship. Hermocrates, with some\r\nothers, accordingly arrived at Camarina from Syracuse, and Euphemus and\r\nothers from the Athenians; and an assembly of the Camarinaeans having\r\nbeen convened, Hermocrates spoke as follows, in the hope of prejudicing\r\nthem against the Athenians:\r\n\r\n“Camarinaeans, we did not come on this embassy because we were afraid\r\nof your being frightened by the actual forces of the Athenians, but\r\nrather of your being gained by what they would say to you before you\r\nheard anything from us. They are come to Sicily with the pretext that\r\nyou know, and the intention which we all suspect, in my opinion less to\r\nrestore the Leontines to their homes than to oust us from ours; as it\r\nis out of all reason that they should restore in Sicily the cities that\r\nthey lay waste in Hellas, or should cherish the Leontine Chalcidians\r\nbecause of their Ionian blood and keep in servitude the Euboean\r\nChalcidians, of whom the Leontines are a colony. No; but the same\r\npolicy which has proved so successful in Hellas is now being tried in\r\nSicily. After being chosen as the leaders of the Ionians and of the\r\nother allies of Athenian origin, to punish the Mede, the Athenians\r\naccused some of failure in military service, some of fighting against\r\neach other, and others, as the case might be, upon any colourable\r\npretext that could be found, until they thus subdued them all. In fine,\r\nin the struggle against the Medes, the Athenians did not fight for the\r\nliberty of the Hellenes, or the Hellenes for their own liberty, but the\r\nformer to make their countrymen serve them instead of him, the latter\r\nto change one master for another, wiser indeed than the first, but\r\nwiser for evil.\r\n\r\n“But we are not now come to declare to an audience familiar with them\r\nthe misdeeds of a state so open to accusation as is the Athenian, but\r\nmuch rather to blame ourselves, who, with the warnings we possess in\r\nthe Hellenes in those parts that have been enslaved through not\r\nsupporting each other, and seeing the same sophisms being now tried\r\nupon ourselves—such as restorations of Leontine kinsfolk and support of\r\nEgestaean allies—do not stand together and resolutely show them that\r\nhere are no Ionians, or Hellespontines, or islanders, who change\r\ncontinually, but always serve a master, sometimes the Mede and\r\nsometimes some other, but free Dorians from independent Peloponnese,\r\ndwelling in Sicily. Or, are we waiting until we be taken in detail, one\r\ncity after another; knowing as we do that in no other way can we be\r\nconquered, and seeing that they turn to this plan, so as to divide some\r\nof us by words, to draw some by the bait of an alliance into open war\r\nwith each other, and to ruin others by such flattery as different\r\ncircumstances may render acceptable? And do we fancy when destruction\r\nfirst overtakes a distant fellow countryman that the danger will not\r\ncome to each of us also, or that he who suffers before us will suffer\r\nin himself alone?\r\n\r\n“As for the Camarinaean who says that it is the Syracusan, not he, that\r\nis the enemy of the Athenian, and who thinks it hard to have to\r\nencounter risk in behalf of my country, I would have him bear in mind\r\nthat he will fight in my country, not more for mine than for his own,\r\nand by so much the more safely in that he will enter on the struggle\r\nnot alone, after the way has been cleared by my ruin, but with me as\r\nhis ally, and that the object of the Athenian is not so much to punish\r\nthe enmity of the Syracusan as to use me as a blind to secure the\r\nfriendship of the Camarinaean. As for him who envies or even fears us\r\n(and envied and feared great powers must always be), and who on this\r\naccount wishes Syracuse to be humbled to teach us a lesson, but would\r\nstill have her survive, in the interest of his own security the wish\r\nthat he indulges is not humanly possible. A man can control his own\r\ndesires, but he cannot likewise control circumstances; and in the event\r\nof his calculations proving mistaken, he may live to bewail his own\r\nmisfortune, and wish to be again envying my prosperity. An idle wish,\r\nif he now sacrifice us and refuse to take his share of perils which are\r\nthe same, in reality though not in name, for him as for us; what is\r\nnominally the preservation of our power being really his own salvation.\r\nIt was to be expected that you, of all people in the world,\r\nCamarinaeans, being our immediate neighbours and the next in danger,\r\nwould have foreseen this, and instead of supporting us in the lukewarm\r\nway that you are now doing, would rather come to us of your own accord,\r\nand be now offering at Syracuse the aid which you would have asked for\r\nat Camarina, if to Camarina the Athenians had first come, to encourage\r\nus to resist the invader. Neither you, however, nor the rest have as\r\nyet bestirred yourselves in this direction.\r\n\r\n“Fear perhaps will make you study to do right both by us and by the\r\ninvaders, and plead that you have an alliance with the Athenians. But\r\nyou made that alliance, not against your friends, but against the\r\nenemies that might attack you, and to help the Athenians when they were\r\nwronged by others, not when as now they are wronging their neighbours.\r\nEven the Rhegians, Chalcidians though they be, refuse to help to\r\nrestore the Chalcidian Leontines; and it would be strange if, while\r\nthey suspect the gist of this fine pretence and are wise without\r\nreason, you, with every reason on your side, should yet choose to\r\nassist your natural enemies, and should join with their direst foes in\r\nundoing those whom nature has made your own kinsfolk. This is not to do\r\nright; but you should help us without fear of their armament, which has\r\nno terrors if we hold together, but only if we let them succeed in\r\ntheir endeavours to separate us; since even after attacking us by\r\nourselves and being victorious in battle, they had to go off without\r\neffecting their purpose.\r\n\r\n“United, therefore, we have no cause to despair, but rather new\r\nencouragement to league together; especially as succour will come to us\r\nfrom the Peloponnesians, in military matters the undoubted superiors of\r\nthe Athenians. And you need not think that your prudent policy of\r\ntaking sides with neither, because allies of both, is either safe for\r\nyou or fair to us. Practically it is not as fair as it pretends to be.\r\nIf the vanquished be defeated, and the victor conquer, through your\r\nrefusing to join, what is the effect of your abstention but to leave\r\nthe former to perish unaided, and to allow the latter to offend\r\nunhindered? And yet it were more honourable to join those who are not\r\nonly the injured party, but your own kindred, and by so doing to defend\r\nthe common interests of Sicily and save your friends the Athenians from\r\ndoing wrong.\r\n\r\n“In conclusion, we Syracusans say that it is useless for us to\r\ndemonstrate either to you or to the rest what you know already as well\r\nas we do; but we entreat, and if our entreaty fail, we protest that we\r\nare menaced by our eternal enemies the Ionians, and are betrayed by you\r\nour fellow Dorians. If the Athenians reduce us, they will owe their\r\nvictory to your decision, but in their own name will reap the honour,\r\nand will receive as the prize of their triumph the very men who enabled\r\nthem to gain it. On the other hand, if we are the conquerors, you will\r\nhave to pay for having been the cause of our danger. Consider,\r\ntherefore; and now make your choice between the security which present\r\nservitude offers and the prospect of conquering with us and so escaping\r\ndisgraceful submission to an Athenian master and avoiding the lasting\r\nenmity of Syracuse.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Hermocrates; after whom Euphemus, the Athenian\r\nambassador, spoke as follows:\r\n\r\n“Although we came here only to renew the former alliance, the attack of\r\nthe Syracusans compels us to speak of our empire and of the good right\r\nwe have to it. The best proof of this the speaker himself furnished,\r\nwhen he called the Ionians eternal enemies of the Dorians. It is the\r\nfact; and the Peloponnesian Dorians being our superiors in numbers and\r\nnext neighbours, we Ionians looked out for the best means of escaping\r\ntheir domination. After the Median War we had a fleet, and so got rid\r\nof the empire and supremacy of the Lacedaemonians, who had no right to\r\ngive orders to us more than we to them, except that of being the\r\nstrongest at that moment; and being appointed leaders of the King’s\r\nformer subjects, we continue to be so, thinking that we are least\r\nlikely to fall under the dominion of the Peloponnesians, if we have a\r\nforce to defend ourselves with, and in strict truth having done nothing\r\nunfair in reducing to subjection the Ionians and islanders, the\r\nkinsfolk whom the Syracusans say we have enslaved. They, our kinsfolk,\r\ncame against their mother country, that is to say against us, together\r\nwith the Mede, and, instead of having the courage to revolt and\r\nsacrifice their property as we did when we abandoned our city, chose to\r\nbe slaves themselves, and to try to make us so.\r\n\r\n“We, therefore, deserve to rule because we placed the largest fleet and\r\nan unflinching patriotism at the service of the Hellenes, and because\r\nthese, our subjects, did us mischief by their ready subservience to the\r\nMedes; and, desert apart, we seek to strengthen ourselves against the\r\nPeloponnesians. We make no fine profession of having a right to rule\r\nbecause we overthrew the barbarian single-handed, or because we risked\r\nwhat we did risk for the freedom of the subjects in question any more\r\nthan for that of all, and for our own: no one can be quarrelled with\r\nfor providing for his proper safety. If we are now here in Sicily, it\r\nis equally in the interest of our security, with which we perceive that\r\nyour interest also coincides. We prove this from the conduct which the\r\nSyracusans cast against us and which you somewhat too timorously\r\nsuspect; knowing that those whom fear has made suspicious may be\r\ncarried away by the charm of eloquence for the moment, but when they\r\ncome to act follow their interests.\r\n\r\n“Now, as we have said, fear makes us hold our empire in Hellas, and\r\nfear makes us now come, with the help of our friends, to order safely\r\nmatters in Sicily, and not to enslave any but rather to prevent any\r\nfrom being enslaved. Meanwhile, let no one imagine that we are\r\ninteresting ourselves in you without your having anything to do with\r\nus, seeing that, if you are preserved and able to make head against the\r\nSyracusans, they will be less likely to harm us by sending troops to\r\nthe Peloponnesians. In this way you have everything to do with us, and\r\non this account it is perfectly reasonable for us to restore the\r\nLeontines, and to make them, not subjects like their kinsmen in Euboea,\r\nbut as powerful as possible, to help us by annoying the Syracusans from\r\ntheir frontier. In Hellas we are alone a match for our enemies; and as\r\nfor the assertion that it is out of all reason that we should free the\r\nSicilian, while we enslave the Chalcidian, the fact is that the latter\r\nis useful to us by being without arms and contributing money only;\r\nwhile the former, the Leontines and our other friends, cannot be too\r\nindependent.\r\n\r\n“Besides, for tyrants and imperial cities nothing is unreasonable if\r\nexpedient, no one a kinsman unless sure; but friendship or enmity is\r\neverywhere an affair of time and circumstance. Here, in Sicily, our\r\ninterest is not to weaken our friends, but by means of their strength\r\nto cripple our enemies. Why doubt this? In Hellas we treat our allies\r\nas we find them useful. The Chians and Methymnians govern themselves\r\nand furnish ships; most of the rest have harder terms and pay tribute\r\nin money; while others, although islanders and easy for us to take, are\r\nfree altogether, because they occupy convenient positions round\r\nPeloponnese. In our settlement of the states here in Sicily, we should\r\ntherefore; naturally be guided by our interest, and by fear, as we say,\r\nof the Syracusans. Their ambition is to rule you, their object to use\r\nthe suspicions that we excite to unite you, and then, when we have gone\r\naway without effecting anything, by force or through your isolation, to\r\nbecome the masters of Sicily. And masters they must become, if you\r\nunite with them; as a force of that magnitude would be no longer easy\r\nfor us to deal with united, and they would be more than a match for you\r\nas soon as we were away.\r\n\r\n“Any other view of the case is condemned by the facts. When you first\r\nasked us over, the fear which you held out was that of danger to Athens\r\nif we let you come under the dominion of Syracuse; and it is not right\r\nnow to mistrust the very same argument by which you claimed to convince\r\nus, or to give way to suspicion because we are come with a larger force\r\nagainst the power of that city. Those whom you should really distrust\r\nare the Syracusans. We are not able to stay here without you, and if we\r\nproved perfidious enough to bring you into subjection, we should be\r\nunable to keep you in bondage, owing to the length of the voyage and\r\nthe difficulty of guarding large, and in a military sense continental,\r\ntowns: they, the Syracusans, live close to you, not in a camp, but in a\r\ncity greater than the force we have with us, plot always against you,\r\nnever let slip an opportunity once offered, as they have shown in the\r\ncase of the Leontines and others, and now have the face, just as if you\r\nwere fools, to invite you to aid them against the power that hinders\r\nthis, and that has thus far maintained Sicily independent. We, as\r\nagainst them, invite you to a much more real safety, when we beg you\r\nnot to betray that common safety which we each have in the other, and\r\nto reflect that they, even without allies, will, by their numbers, have\r\nalways the way open to you, while you will not often have the\r\nopportunity of defending yourselves with such numerous auxiliaries; if,\r\nthrough your suspicions, you once let these go away unsuccessful or\r\ndefeated, you will wish to see if only a handful of them back again,\r\nwhen the day is past in which their presence could do anything for you.\r\n\r\n“But we hope, Camarinaeans, that the calumnies of the Syracusans will\r\nnot be allowed to succeed either with you or with the rest: we have\r\ntold you the whole truth upon the things we are suspected of, and will\r\nnow briefly recapitulate, in the hope of convincing you. We assert that\r\nwe are rulers in Hellas in order not to be subjects; liberators in\r\nSicily that we may not be harmed by the Sicilians; that we are\r\ncompelled to interfere in many things, because we have many things to\r\nguard against; and that now, as before, we are come as allies to those\r\nof you who suffer wrong in this island, not without invitation but upon\r\ninvitation. Accordingly, instead of making yourselves judges or censors\r\nof our conduct, and trying to turn us, which it were now difficult to\r\ndo, so far as there is anything in our interfering policy or in our\r\ncharacter that chimes in with your interest, this take and make use of;\r\nand be sure that, far from being injurious to all alike, to most of the\r\nHellenes that policy is even beneficial. Thanks to it, all men in all\r\nplaces, even where we are not, who either apprehend or meditate\r\naggression, from the near prospect before them, in the one case, of\r\nobtaining our intervention in their favour, in the other, of our\r\narrival making the venture dangerous, find themselves constrained,\r\nrespectively, to be moderate against their will, and to be preserved\r\nwithout trouble of their own. Do not you reject this security that is\r\nopen to all who desire it, and is now offered to you; but do like\r\nothers, and instead of being always on the defensive against the\r\nSyracusans, unite with us, and in your turn at last threaten them.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Euphemus. What the Camarinaeans felt was this.\r\nSympathizing with the Athenians, except in so far as they might be\r\nafraid of their subjugating Sicily, they had always been at enmity with\r\ntheir neighbour Syracuse. From the very fact, however, that they were\r\ntheir neighbours, they feared the Syracusans most of the two, and being\r\napprehensive of their conquering even without them, both sent them in\r\nthe first instance the few horsemen mentioned, and for the future\r\ndetermined to support them most in fact, although as sparingly as\r\npossible; but for the moment in order not to seem to slight the\r\nAthenians, especially as they had been successful in the engagement, to\r\nanswer both alike. Agreeably to this resolution they answered that as\r\nboth the contending parties happened to be allies of theirs, they\r\nthought it most consistent with their oaths at present to side with\r\nneither; with which answer the ambassadors of either party departed.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, while Syracuse pursued her preparations for war, the\r\nAthenians were encamped at Naxos, and tried by negotiation to gain as\r\nmany of the Sicels as possible. Those more in the low lands, and\r\nsubjects of Syracuse, mostly held aloof; but the peoples of the\r\ninterior who had never been otherwise than independent, with few\r\nexceptions, at once joined the Athenians, and brought down corn to the\r\narmy, and in some cases even money. The Athenians marched against those\r\nwho refused to join, and forced some of them to do so; in the case of\r\nothers they were stopped by the Syracusans sending garrisons and\r\nreinforcements. Meanwhile the Athenians moved their winter quarters\r\nfrom Naxos to Catana, and reconstructed the camp burnt by the\r\nSyracusans, and stayed there the rest of the winter. They also sent a\r\ngalley to Carthage, with proffers of friendship, on the chance of\r\nobtaining assistance, and another to Tyrrhenia; some of the cities\r\nthere having spontaneously offered to join them in the war. They also\r\nsent round to the Sicels and to Egesta, desiring them to send them as\r\nmany horses as possible, and meanwhile prepared bricks, iron, and all\r\nother things necessary for the work of circumvallation, intending by\r\nthe spring to begin hostilities.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Syracusan envoys dispatched to Corinth and\r\nLacedaemon tried as they passed along the coast to persuade the\r\nItaliots to interfere with the proceedings of the Athenians, which\r\nthreatened Italy quite as much as Syracuse, and having arrived at\r\nCorinth made a speech calling on the Corinthians to assist them on the\r\nground of their common origin. The Corinthians voted at once to aid\r\nthem heart and soul themselves, and then sent on envoys with them to\r\nLacedaemon, to help them to persuade her also to prosecute the war with\r\nthe Athenians more openly at home and to send succours to Sicily. The\r\nenvoys from Corinth having reached Lacedaemon found there Alcibiades\r\nwith his fellow refugees, who had at once crossed over in a trading\r\nvessel from Thurii, first to Cyllene in Elis, and afterwards from\r\nthence to Lacedaemon; upon the Lacedaemonians’ own invitation, after\r\nfirst obtaining a safe conduct, as he feared them for the part he had\r\ntaken in the affair of Mantinea. The result was that the Corinthians,\r\nSyracusans, and Alcibiades, pressing all the same request in the\r\nassembly of the Lacedaemonians, succeeded in persuading them; but as\r\nthe ephors and the authorities, although resolved to send envoys to\r\nSyracuse to prevent their surrendering to the Athenians, showed no\r\ndisposition to send them any assistance, Alcibiades now came forward\r\nand inflamed and stirred the Lacedaemonians by speaking as follows:\r\n\r\n“I am forced first to speak to you of the prejudice with which I am\r\nregarded, in order that suspicion may not make you disinclined to\r\nlisten to me upon public matters. The connection, with you as your\r\nproxeni, which the ancestors of our family by reason of some discontent\r\nrenounced, I personally tried to renew by my good offices towards you,\r\nin particular upon the occasion of the disaster at Pylos. But although\r\nI maintained this friendly attitude, you yet chose to negotiate the\r\npeace with the Athenians through my enemies, and thus to strengthen\r\nthem and to discredit me. You had therefore no right to complain if I\r\nturned to the Mantineans and Argives, and seized other occasions of\r\nthwarting and injuring you; and the time has now come when those among\r\nyou, who in the bitterness of the moment may have been then unfairly\r\nangry with me, should look at the matter in its true light, and take a\r\ndifferent view. Those again who judged me unfavourably, because I\r\nleaned rather to the side of the commons, must not think that their\r\ndislike is any better founded. We have always been hostile to tyrants,\r\nand all who oppose arbitrary power are called commons; hence we\r\ncontinued to act as leaders of the multitude; besides which, as\r\ndemocracy was the government of the city, it was necessary in most\r\nthings to conform to established conditions. However, we endeavoured to\r\nbe more moderate than the licentious temper of the times; and while\r\nthere were others, formerly as now, who tried to lead the multitude\r\nastray—the same who banished me—our party was that of the whole people,\r\nour creed being to do our part in preserving the form of government\r\nunder which the city enjoyed the utmost greatness and freedom, and\r\nwhich we had found existing. As for democracy, the men of sense among\r\nus knew what it was, and I perhaps as well as any, as I have the more\r\ncause to complain of it; but there is nothing new to be said of a\r\npatent absurdity; meanwhile we did not think it safe to alter it under\r\nthe pressure of your hostility.\r\n\r\n“So much then for the prejudices with which I am regarded: I now can\r\ncall your attention to the questions you must consider, and upon which\r\nsuperior knowledge perhaps permits me to speak. We sailed to Sicily\r\nfirst to conquer, if possible, the Siceliots, and after them the\r\nItaliots also, and finally to assail the empire and city of Carthage.\r\nIn the event of all or most of these schemes succeeding, we were then\r\nto attack Peloponnese, bringing with us the entire force of the\r\nHellenes lately acquired in those parts, and taking a number of\r\nbarbarians into our pay, such as the Iberians and others in those\r\ncountries, confessedly the most warlike known, and building numerous\r\ngalleys in addition to those which we had already, timber being\r\nplentiful in Italy; and with this fleet blockading Peloponnese from the\r\nsea and assailing it with our armies by land, taking some of the cities\r\nby storm, drawing works of circumvallation round others, we hoped\r\nwithout difficulty to effect its reduction, and after this to rule the\r\nwhole of the Hellenic name. Money and corn meanwhile for the better\r\nexecution of these plans were to be supplied in sufficient quantities\r\nby the newly acquired places in those countries, independently of our\r\nrevenues here at home.\r\n\r\n“You have thus heard the history of the present expedition from the man\r\nwho most exactly knows what our objects were; and the remaining\r\ngenerals will, if they can, carry these out just the same. But that the\r\nstates in Sicily must succumb if you do not help them, I will now show.\r\nAlthough the Siceliots, with all their inexperience, might even now be\r\nsaved if their forces were united, the Syracusans alone, beaten already\r\nin one battle with all their people and blockaded from the sea, will be\r\nunable to withstand the Athenian armament that is now there. But if\r\nSyracuse falls, all Sicily falls also, and Italy immediately\r\nafterwards; and the danger which I just now spoke of from that quarter\r\nwill before long be upon you. None need therefore fancy that Sicily\r\nonly is in question; Peloponnese will be so also, unless you speedily\r\ndo as I tell you, and send on board ship to Syracuse troops that shall\r\nable to row their ships themselves, and serve as heavy infantry the\r\nmoment that they land; and what I consider even more important than the\r\ntroops, a Spartan as commanding officer to discipline the forces\r\nalready on foot and to compel recusants to serve. The friends that you\r\nhave already will thus become more confident, and the waverers will be\r\nencouraged to join you. Meanwhile you must carry on the war here more\r\nopenly, that the Syracusans, seeing that you do not forget them, may\r\nput heart into their resistance, and that the Athenians may be less\r\nable to reinforce their armament. You must fortify Decelea in Attica,\r\nthe blow of which the Athenians are always most afraid and the only one\r\nthat they think they have not experienced in the present war; the\r\nsurest method of harming an enemy being to find out what he most fears,\r\nand to choose this means of attacking him, since every one naturally\r\nknows best his own weak points and fears accordingly. The fortification\r\nin question, while it benefits you, will create difficulties for your\r\nadversaries, of which I shall pass over many, and shall only mention\r\nthe chief. Whatever property there is in the country will most of it\r\nbecome yours, either by capture or surrender; and the Athenians will at\r\nonce be deprived of their revenues from the silver mines at Laurium, of\r\ntheir present gains from their land and from the law courts, and above\r\nall of the revenue from their allies, which will be paid less\r\nregularly, as they lose their awe of Athens and see you addressing\r\nyourselves with vigour to the war. The zeal and speed with which all\r\nthis shall be done depends, Lacedaemonians, upon yourselves; as to its\r\npossibility, I am quite confident, and I have little fear of being\r\nmistaken.\r\n\r\n“Meanwhile I hope that none of you will think any the worse of me if,\r\nafter having hitherto passed as a lover of my country, I now actively\r\njoin its worst enemies in attacking it, or will suspect what I say as\r\nthe fruit of an outlaw’s enthusiasm. I am an outlaw from the iniquity\r\nof those who drove me forth, not, if you will be guided by me, from\r\nyour service; my worst enemies are not you who only harmed your foes,\r\nbut they who forced their friends to become enemies; and love of\r\ncountry is what I do not feel when I am wronged, but what I felt when\r\nsecure in my rights as a citizen. Indeed I do not consider that I am\r\nnow attacking a country that is still mine; I am rather trying to\r\nrecover one that is mine no longer; and the true lover of his country\r\nis not he who consents to lose it unjustly rather than attack it, but\r\nhe who longs for it so much that he will go all lengths to recover it.\r\nFor myself, therefore, Lacedaemonians, I beg you to use me without\r\nscruple for danger and trouble of every kind, and to remember the\r\nargument in every one’s mouth, that if I did you great harm as an\r\nenemy, I could likewise do you good service as a friend, inasmuch as I\r\nknow the plans of the Athenians, while I only guessed yours. For\r\nyourselves I entreat you to believe that your most capital interests\r\nare now under deliberation; and I urge you to send without hesitation\r\nthe expeditions to Sicily and Attica; by the presence of a small part\r\nof your forces you will save important cities in that island, and you\r\nwill destroy the power of Athens both present and prospective; after\r\nthis you will dwell in security and enjoy the supremacy over all\r\nHellas, resting not on force but upon consent and affection.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the words of Alcibiades. The Lacedaemonians, who had\r\nthemselves before intended to march against Athens, but were still\r\nwaiting and looking about them, at once became much more in earnest\r\nwhen they received this particular information from Alcibiades, and\r\nconsidered that they had heard it from the man who best knew the truth\r\nof the matter. Accordingly they now turned their attention to the\r\nfortifying of Decelea and sending immediate aid to the Sicilians; and\r\nnaming Gylippus, son of Cleandridas, to the command of the Syracusans,\r\nbade him consult with that people and with the Corinthians and arrange\r\nfor succours reaching the island, in the best and speediest way\r\npossible under the circumstances. Gylippus desired the Corinthians to\r\nsend him at once two ships to Asine, and to prepare the rest that they\r\nintended to send, and to have them ready to sail at the proper time.\r\nHaving settled this, the envoys departed from Lacedaemon.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime arrived the Athenian galley from Sicily sent by the\r\ngenerals for money and cavalry; and the Athenians, after hearing what\r\nthey wanted, voted to send the supplies for the armament and the\r\ncavalry. And the winter ended, and with it ended the seventeenth year\r\nof the present war of which Thucydides is the historian.\r\n\r\nThe next summer, at the very beginning of the season, the Athenians in\r\nSicily put out from Catana, and sailed along shore to Megara in Sicily,\r\nfrom which, as I have mentioned above, the Syracusans expelled the\r\ninhabitants in the time of their tyrant Gelo, themselves occupying the\r\nterritory. Here the Athenians landed and laid waste the country, and\r\nafter an unsuccessful attack upon a fort of the Syracusans, went on\r\nwith the fleet and army to the river Terias, and advancing inland laid\r\nwaste the plain and set fire to the corn; and after killing some of a\r\nsmall Syracusan party which they encountered, and setting up a trophy,\r\nwent back again to their ships. They now sailed to Catana and took in\r\nprovisions there, and going with their whole force against Centoripa, a\r\ntown of the Sicels, acquired it by capitulation, and departed, after\r\nalso burning the corn of the Inessaeans and Hybleans. Upon their return\r\nto Catana they found the horsemen arrived from Athens, to the number of\r\ntwo hundred and fifty (with their equipments, but without their horses\r\nwhich were to be procured upon the spot), and thirty mounted archers\r\nand three hundred talents of silver.\r\n\r\nThe same spring the Lacedaemonians marched against Argos, and went as\r\nfar as Cleonae, when an earthquake occurred and caused them to return.\r\nAfter this the Argives invaded the Thyreatid, which is on their border,\r\nand took much booty from the Lacedaemonians, which was sold for no less\r\nthan twenty-five talents. The same summer, not long after, the Thespian\r\ncommons made an attack upon the party in office, which was not\r\nsuccessful, but succours arrived from Thebes, and some were caught,\r\nwhile others took refuge at Athens.\r\n\r\nThe same summer the Syracusans learned that the Athenians had been\r\njoined by their cavalry, and were on the point of marching against\r\nthem; and seeing that without becoming masters of Epipolae, a\r\nprecipitous spot situated exactly over the town, the Athenians could\r\nnot, even if victorious in battle, easily invest them, they determined\r\nto guard its approaches, in order that the enemy might not ascend\r\nunobserved by this, the sole way by which ascent was possible, as the\r\nremainder is lofty ground, and falls right down to the city, and can\r\nall be seen from inside; and as it lies above the rest the place is\r\ncalled by the Syracusans Epipolae or Overtown. They accordingly went\r\nout in mass at daybreak into the meadow along the river Anapus, their\r\nnew generals, Hermocrates and his colleagues, having just come into\r\noffice, and held a review of their heavy infantry, from whom they first\r\nselected a picked body of six hundred, under the command of Diomilus,\r\nan exile from Andros, to guard Epipolae, and to be ready to muster at a\r\nmoment’s notice to help wherever help should be required.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians, the very same morning, were holding a review,\r\nhaving already made land unobserved with all the armament from Catana,\r\nopposite a place called Leon, not much more than half a mile from\r\nEpipolae, where they disembarked their army, bringing the fleet to\r\nanchor at Thapsus, a peninsula running out into the sea, with a narrow\r\nisthmus, and not far from the city of Syracuse either by land or water.\r\nWhile the naval force of the Athenians threw a stockade across the\r\nisthmus and remained quiet at Thapsus, the land army immediately went\r\non at a run to Epipolae, and succeeded in getting up by Euryelus before\r\nthe Syracusans perceived them, or could come up from the meadow and the\r\nreview. Diomilus with his six hundred and the rest advanced as quickly\r\nas they could, but they had nearly three miles to go from the meadow\r\nbefore reaching them. Attacking in this way in considerable disorder,\r\nthe Syracusans were defeated in battle at Epipolae and retired to the\r\ntown, with a loss of about three hundred killed, and Diomilus among the\r\nnumber. After this the Athenians set up a trophy and restored to the\r\nSyracusans their dead under truce, and next day descended to Syracuse\r\nitself; and no one coming out to meet them, reascended and built a fort\r\nat Labdalum, upon the edge of the cliffs of Epipolae, looking towards\r\nMegara, to serve as a magazine for their baggage and money, whenever\r\nthey advanced to battle or to work at the lines.\r\n\r\nNot long afterwards three hundred cavalry came to them from Egesta, and\r\nabout a hundred from the Sicels, Naxians, and others; and thus, with\r\nthe two hundred and fifty from Athens, for whom they had got horses\r\nfrom the Egestaeans and Catanians, besides others that they bought,\r\nthey now mustered six hundred and fifty cavalry in all. After posting a\r\ngarrison in Labdalum, they advanced to Syca, where they sat down and\r\nquickly built the Circle or centre of their wall of circumvallation.\r\nThe Syracusans, appalled at the rapidity with which the work advanced,\r\ndetermined to go out against them and give battle and interrupt it; and\r\nthe two armies were already in battle array, when the Syracusan\r\ngenerals observed that their troops found such difficulty in getting\r\ninto line, and were in such disorder, that they led them back into the\r\ntown, except part of the cavalry. These remained and hindered the\r\nAthenians from carrying stones or dispersing to any great distance,\r\nuntil a tribe of the Athenian heavy infantry, with all the cavalry,\r\ncharged and routed the Syracusan horse with some loss; after which they\r\nset up a trophy for the cavalry action.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Athenians began building the wall to the north of the\r\nCircle, at the same time collecting stone and timber, which they kept\r\nlaying down towards Trogilus along the shortest line for their works\r\nfrom the great harbour to the sea; while the Syracusans, guided by\r\ntheir generals, and above all by Hermocrates, instead of risking any\r\nmore general engagements, determined to build a counterwork in the\r\ndirection in which the Athenians were going to carry their wall. If\r\nthis could be completed in time, the enemy’s lines would be cut; and\r\nmeanwhile, if he were to attempt to interrupt them by an attack, they\r\nwould send a part of their forces against him, and would secure the\r\napproaches beforehand with their stockade, while the Athenians would\r\nhave to leave off working with their whole force in order to attend to\r\nthem. They accordingly sallied forth and began to build, starting from\r\ntheir city, running a cross wall below the Athenian Circle, cutting\r\ndown the olives and erecting wooden towers. As the Athenian fleet had\r\nnot yet sailed round into the great harbour, the Syracusans still\r\ncommanded the seacoast, and the Athenians brought their provisions by\r\nland from Thapsus.\r\n\r\nThe Syracusans now thought the stockades and stonework of their\r\ncounterwall sufficiently far advanced; and as the Athenians, afraid of\r\nbeing divided and so fighting at a disadvantage, and intent upon their\r\nown wall, did not come out to interrupt them, they left one tribe to\r\nguard the new work and went back into the city. Meanwhile the Athenians\r\ndestroyed their pipes of drinking-water carried underground into the\r\ncity; and watching until the rest of the Syracusans were in their tents\r\nat midday, and some even gone away into the city, and those in the\r\nstockade keeping but indifferent guard, appointed three hundred picked\r\nmen of their own, and some men picked from the light troops and armed\r\nfor the purpose, to run suddenly as fast as they could to the\r\ncounterwork, while the rest of the army advanced in two divisions, the\r\none with one of the generals to the city in case of a sortie, the other\r\nwith the other general to the stockade by the postern gate. The three\r\nhundred attacked and took the stockade, abandoned by its garrison, who\r\ntook refuge in the outworks round the statue of Apollo Temenites. Here\r\nthe pursuers burst in with them, and after getting in were beaten out\r\nby the Syracusans, and some few of the Argives and Athenians slain;\r\nafter which the whole army retired, and having demolished the\r\ncounterwork and pulled up the stockade, carried away the stakes to\r\ntheir own lines, and set up a trophy.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Athenians from the Circle proceeded to fortify the\r\ncliff above the marsh which on this side of Epipolae looks towards the\r\ngreat harbour; this being also the shortest line for their work to go\r\ndown across the plain and the marsh to the harbour. Meanwhile the\r\nSyracusans marched out and began a second stockade, starting from the\r\ncity, across the middle of the marsh, digging a trench alongside to\r\nmake it impossible for the Athenians to carry their wall down to the\r\nsea. As soon as the Athenians had finished their work at the cliff they\r\nagain attacked the stockade and ditch of the Syracusans. Ordering the\r\nfleet to sail round from Thapsus into the great harbour of Syracuse,\r\nthey descended at about dawn from Epipolae into the plain, and laying\r\ndoors and planks over the marsh, where it was muddy and firmest,\r\ncrossed over on these, and by daybreak took the ditch and the stockade,\r\nexcept a small portion which they captured afterwards. A battle now\r\nensued, in which the Athenians were victorious, the right wing of the\r\nSyracusans flying to the town and the left to the river. The three\r\nhundred picked Athenians, wishing to cut off their passage, pressed on\r\nat a run to the bridge, when the alarmed Syracusans, who had with them\r\nmost of their cavalry, closed and routed them, hurling them back upon\r\nthe Athenian right wing, the first tribe of which was thrown into a\r\npanic by the shock. Seeing this, Lamachus came to their aid from the\r\nAthenian left with a few archers and with the Argives, and crossing a\r\nditch, was left alone with a few that had crossed with him, and was\r\nkilled with five or six of his men. These the Syracusans managed\r\nimmediately to snatch up in haste and get across the river into a place\r\nof security, themselves retreating as the rest of the Athenian army now\r\ncame up.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile those who had at first fled for refuge to the city, seeing\r\nthe turn affairs were taking, now rallied from the town and formed\r\nagainst the Athenians in front of them, sending also a part of their\r\nnumber to the Circle on Epipolae, which they hoped to take while\r\ndenuded of its defenders. These took and destroyed the Athenian outwork\r\nof a thousand feet, the Circle itself being saved by Nicias, who\r\nhappened to have been left in it through illness, and who now ordered\r\nthe servants to set fire to the engines and timber thrown down before\r\nthe wall; want of men, as he was aware, rendering all other means of\r\nescape impossible. This step was justified by the result, the\r\nSyracusans not coming any further on account of the fire, but\r\nretreating. Meanwhile succours were coming up from the Athenians below,\r\nwho had put to flight the troops opposed to them; and the fleet also,\r\naccording to orders, was sailing from Thapsus into the great harbour.\r\nSeeing this, the troops on the heights retired in haste, and the whole\r\narmy of the Syracusans re-entered the city, thinking that with their\r\npresent force they would no longer be able to hinder the wall reaching\r\nthe sea.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Athenians set up a trophy and restored to the Syracusans\r\ntheir dead under truce, receiving in return Lamachus and those who had\r\nfallen with him. The whole of their forces, naval and military, being\r\nnow with them, they began from Epipolae and the cliffs and enclosed the\r\nSyracusans with a double wall down to the sea. Provisions were now\r\nbrought in for the armament from all parts of Italy; and many of the\r\nSicels, who had hitherto been looking to see how things went, came as\r\nallies to the Athenians: there also arrived three ships of fifty oars\r\nfrom Tyrrhenia. Meanwhile everything else progressed favourably for\r\ntheir hopes. The Syracusans began to despair of finding safety in arms,\r\nno relief having reached them from Peloponnese, and were now proposing\r\nterms of capitulation among themselves and to Nicias, who after the\r\ndeath of Lamachus was left sole commander. No decision was come to,\r\nbut, as was natural with men in difficulties and besieged more straitly\r\nthan before, there was much discussion with Nicias and still more in\r\nthe town. Their present misfortunes had also made them suspicious of\r\none another; and the blame of their disasters was thrown upon the\r\nill-fortune or treachery of the generals under whose command they had\r\nhappened; and these were deposed and others, Heraclides, Eucles, and\r\nTellias, elected in their stead.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Lacedaemonian, Gylippus, and the ships from Corinth were\r\nnow off Leucas, intent upon going with all haste to the relief of\r\nSicily. The reports that reached them being of an alarming kind, and\r\nall agreeing in the falsehood that Syracuse was already completely\r\ninvested, Gylippus abandoned all hope of Sicily, and wishing to save\r\nItaly, rapidly crossed the Ionian Sea to Tarentum with the Corinthian,\r\nPythen, two Laconian, and two Corinthian vessels, leaving the\r\nCorinthians to follow him after manning, in addition to their own ten,\r\ntwo Leucadian and two Ambraciot ships. From Tarentum Gylippus first\r\nwent on an embassy to Thurii, and claimed anew the rights of\r\ncitizenship which his father had enjoyed; failing to bring over the\r\ntownspeople, he weighed anchor and coasted along Italy. Opposite the\r\nTerinaean Gulf he was caught by the wind which blows violently and\r\nsteadily from the north in that quarter, and was carried out to sea;\r\nand after experiencing very rough weather, remade Tarentum, where he\r\nhauled ashore and refitted such of his ships as had suffered most from\r\nthe tempest. Nicias heard of his approach, but, like the Thurians,\r\ndespised the scanty number of his ships, and set down piracy as the\r\nonly probable object of the voyage, and so took no precautions for the\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time in this summer, the Lacedaemonians invaded Argos\r\nwith their allies, and laid waste most of the country. The Athenians\r\nwent with thirty ships to the relief of the Argives, thus breaking\r\ntheir treaty with the Lacedaemonians in the most overt manner. Up to\r\nthis time incursions from Pylos, descents on the coast of the rest of\r\nPeloponnese, instead of on the Laconian, had been the extent of their\r\nco-operation with the Argives and Mantineans; and although the Argives\r\nhad often begged them to land, if only for a moment, with their heavy\r\ninfantry in Laconia, lay waste ever so little of it with them, and\r\ndepart, they had always refused to do so. Now, however, under the\r\ncommand of Phytodorus, Laespodius, and Demaratus, they landed at\r\nEpidaurus Limera, Prasiae, and other places, and plundered the country;\r\nand thus furnished the Lacedaemonians with a better pretext for\r\nhostilities against Athens. After the Athenians had retired from Argos\r\nwith their fleet, and the Lacedaemonians also, the Argives made an\r\nincursion into the Phlisaid, and returned home after ravaging their\r\nland and killing some of the inhabitants.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI\r\n\r\n\r\nEighteenth and Nineteenth Years of the War—Arrival of Gylippus at\r\nSyracuse—Fortification of Decelea—Successes of the Syracusans\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter refitting their ships, Gylippus and Pythen coasted along from\r\nTarentum to Epizephyrian Locris. They now received the more correct\r\ninformation that Syracuse was not yet completely invested, but that it\r\nwas still possible for an army arriving at Epipolae to effect an\r\nentrance; and they consulted, accordingly, whether they should keep\r\nSicily on their right and risk sailing in by sea, or, leaving it on\r\ntheir left, should first sail to Himera and, taking with them the\r\nHimeraeans and any others that might agree to join them, go to Syracuse\r\nby land. Finally they determined to sail for Himera, especially as the\r\nfour Athenian ships which Nicias had at length sent off, on hearing\r\nthat they were at Locris, had not yet arrived at Rhegium. Accordingly,\r\nbefore these reached their post, the Peloponnesians crossed the strait\r\nand, after touching at Rhegium and Messina, came to Himera. Arrived\r\nthere, they persuaded the Himeraeans to join in the war, and not only\r\nto go with them themselves but to provide arms for the seamen from\r\ntheir vessels which they had drawn ashore at Himera; and they sent and\r\nappointed a place for the Selinuntines to meet them with all their\r\nforces. A few troops were also promised by the Geloans and some of the\r\nSicels, who were now ready to join them with much greater alacrity,\r\nowing to the recent death of Archonidas, a powerful Sicel king in that\r\nneighbourhood and friendly to Athens, and owing also to the vigour\r\nshown by Gylippus in coming from Lacedaemon. Gylippus now took with him\r\nabout seven hundred of his sailors and marines, that number only having\r\narms, a thousand heavy infantry and light troops from Himera with a\r\nbody of a hundred horse, some light troops and cavalry from Selinus, a\r\nfew Geloans, and Sicels numbering a thousand in all, and set out on his\r\nmarch for Syracuse.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Corinthian fleet from Leucas made all haste to arrive;\r\nand one of their commanders, Gongylus, starting last with a single\r\nship, was the first to reach Syracuse, a little before Gylippus.\r\nGongylus found the Syracusans on the point of holding an assembly to\r\nconsider whether they should put an end to the war. This he prevented,\r\nand reassured them by telling them that more vessels were still to\r\narrive, and that Gylippus, son of Cleandridas, had been dispatched by\r\nthe Lacedaemonians to take the command. Upon this the Syracusans took\r\ncourage, and immediately marched out with all their forces to meet\r\nGylippus, who they found was now close at hand. Meanwhile Gylippus,\r\nafter taking Ietae, a fort of the Sicels, on his way, formed his army\r\nin order of battle, and so arrived at Epipolae, and ascending by\r\nEuryelus, as the Athenians had done at first, now advanced with the\r\nSyracusans against the Athenian lines. His arrival chanced at a\r\ncritical moment. The Athenians had already finished a double wall of\r\nsix or seven furlongs to the great harbour, with the exception of a\r\nsmall portion next the sea, which they were still engaged upon; and in\r\nthe remainder of the circle towards Trogilus on the other sea, stones\r\nhad been laid ready for building for the greater part of the distance,\r\nand some points had been left half finished, while others were entirely\r\ncompleted. The danger of Syracuse had indeed been great.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Athenians, recovering from the confusion into which they\r\nhad been first thrown by the sudden approach of Gylippus and the\r\nSyracusans, formed in order of battle. Gylippus halted at a short\r\ndistance off and sent on a herald to tell them that, if they would\r\nevacuate Sicily with bag and baggage within five days’ time, he was\r\nwilling to make a truce accordingly. The Athenians treated this\r\nproposition with contempt, and dismissed the herald without an answer.\r\nAfter this both sides began to prepare for action. Gylippus, observing\r\nthat the Syracusans were in disorder and did not easily fall into line,\r\ndrew off his troops more into the open ground, while Nicias did not\r\nlead on the Athenians but lay still by his own wall. When Gylippus saw\r\nthat they did not come on, he led off his army to the citadel of the\r\nquarter of Apollo Temenites, and passed the night there. On the\r\nfollowing day he led out the main body of his army, and, drawing them\r\nup in order of battle before the walls of the Athenians to prevent\r\ntheir going to the relief of any other quarter, dispatched a strong\r\nforce against Fort Labdalum, and took it, and put all whom he found in\r\nit to the sword, the place not being within sight of the Athenians. On\r\nthe same day an Athenian galley that lay moored off the harbour was\r\ncaptured by the Syracusans.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Syracusans and their allies began to carry a single\r\nwall, starting from the city, in a slanting direction up Epipolae, in\r\norder that the Athenians, unless they could hinder the work, might be\r\nno longer able to invest them. Meanwhile the Athenians, having now\r\nfinished their wall down to the sea, had come up to the heights; and\r\npart of their wall being weak, Gylippus drew out his army by night and\r\nattacked it. However, the Athenians who happened to be bivouacking\r\noutside took the alarm and came out to meet him, upon seeing which he\r\nquickly led his men back again. The Athenians now built their wall\r\nhigher, and in future kept guard at this point themselves, disposing\r\ntheir confederates along the remainder of the works, at the stations\r\nassigned to them. Nicias also determined to fortify Plemmyrium, a\r\npromontory over against the city, which juts out and narrows the mouth\r\nof the Great Harbour. He thought that the fortification of this place\r\nwould make it easier to bring in supplies, as they would be able to\r\ncarry on their blockade from a less distance, near to the port occupied\r\nby the Syracusans; instead of being obliged, upon every movement of the\r\nenemy’s navy, to put out against them from the bottom of the great\r\nharbour. Besides this, he now began to pay more attention to the war by\r\nsea, seeing that the coming of Gylippus had diminished their hopes by\r\nland. Accordingly, he conveyed over his ships and some troops, and\r\nbuilt three forts in which he placed most of his baggage, and moored\r\nthere for the future the larger craft and men-of-war. This was the\r\nfirst and chief occasion of the losses which the crews experienced. The\r\nwater which they used was scarce and had to be fetched from far, and\r\nthe sailors could not go out for firewood without being cut off by the\r\nSyracusan horse, who were masters of the country; a third of the\r\nenemy’s cavalry being stationed at the little town of Olympieum, to\r\nprevent plundering incursions on the part of the Athenians at\r\nPlemmyrium. Meanwhile Nicias learned that the rest of the Corinthian\r\nfleet was approaching, and sent twenty ships to watch for them, with\r\norders to be on the look-out for them about Locris and Rhegium and the\r\napproach to Sicily.\r\n\r\nGylippus, meanwhile, went on with the wall across Epipolae, using the\r\nstones which the Athenians had laid down for their own wall, and at the\r\nsame time constantly led out the Syracusans and their allies, and\r\nformed them in order of battle in front of the lines, the Athenians\r\nforming against him. At last he thought that the moment was come, and\r\nbegan the attack; and a hand-to-hand fight ensued between the lines,\r\nwhere the Syracusan cavalry could be of no use; and the Syracusans and\r\ntheir allies were defeated and took up their dead under truce, while\r\nthe Athenians erected a trophy. After this Gylippus called the soldiers\r\ntogether, and said that the fault was not theirs but his; he had kept\r\ntheir lines too much within the works, and had thus deprived them of\r\nthe services of their cavalry and darters. He would now, therefore,\r\nlead them on a second time. He begged them to remember that in material\r\nforce they would be fully a match for their opponents, while, with\r\nrespect to moral advantages, it were intolerable if Peloponnesians and\r\nDorians should not feel confident of overcoming Ionians and islanders\r\nwith the motley rabble that accompanied them, and of driving them out\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\nAfter this he embraced the first opportunity that offered of again\r\nleading them against the enemy. Now Nicias and the Athenians held the\r\nopinion that even if the Syracusans should not wish to offer battle, it\r\nwas necessary for them to prevent the building of the cross wall, as it\r\nalready almost overlapped the extreme point of their own, and if it\r\nwent any further it would from that moment make no difference whether\r\nthey fought ever so many successful actions, or never fought at all.\r\nThey accordingly came out to meet the Syracusans. Gylippus led out his\r\nheavy infantry further from the fortifications than on the former\r\noccasion, and so joined battle; posting his horse and darters upon the\r\nflank of the Athenians in the open space, where the works of the two\r\nwalls terminated. During the engagement the cavalry attacked and routed\r\nthe left wing of the Athenians, which was opposed to them; and the rest\r\nof the Athenian army was in consequence defeated by the Syracusans and\r\ndriven headlong within their lines. The night following the Syracusans\r\ncarried their wall up to the Athenian works and passed them, thus\r\nputting it out of their power any longer to stop them, and depriving\r\nthem, even if victorious in the field, of all chance of investing the\r\ncity for the future.\r\n\r\nAfter this the remaining twelve vessels of the Corinthians, Ambraciots,\r\nand Leucadians sailed into the harbour under the command of Erasinides,\r\na Corinthian, having eluded the Athenian ships on guard, and helped the\r\nSyracusans in completing the remainder of the cross wall. Meanwhile\r\nGylippus went into the rest of Sicily to raise land and naval forces,\r\nand also to bring over any of the cities that either were lukewarm in\r\nthe cause or had hitherto kept out of the war altogether. Syracusan and\r\nCorinthian envoys were also dispatched to Lacedaemon and Corinth to get\r\na fresh force sent over, in any way that might offer, either in\r\nmerchant vessels or transports, or in any other manner likely to prove\r\nsuccessful, as the Athenians too were sending for reinforcements; while\r\nthe Syracusans proceeded to man a fleet and to exercise, meaning to try\r\ntheir fortune in this way also, and generally became exceedingly\r\nconfident.\r\n\r\nNicias perceiving this, and seeing the strength of the enemy and his\r\nown difficulties daily increasing, himself also sent to Athens. He had\r\nbefore sent frequent reports of events as they occurred, and felt it\r\nespecially incumbent upon him to do so now, as he thought that they\r\nwere in a critical position, and that, unless speedily recalled or\r\nstrongly reinforced from home, they had no hope of safety. He feared,\r\nhowever, that the messengers, either through inability to speak, or\r\nthrough failure of memory, or from a wish to please the multitude,\r\nmight not report the truth, and so thought it best to write a letter,\r\nto ensure that the Athenians should know his own opinion without its\r\nbeing lost in transmission, and be able to decide upon the real facts\r\nof the case.\r\n\r\nHis emissaries, accordingly, departed with the letter and the requisite\r\nverbal instructions; and he attended to the affairs of the army, making\r\nit his aim now to keep on the defensive and to avoid any unnecessary\r\ndanger.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the same summer the Athenian general Euetion marched in\r\nconcert with Perdiccas with a large body of Thracians against\r\nAmphipolis, and failing to take it brought some galleys round into the\r\nStrymon, and blockaded the town from the river, having his base at\r\nHimeraeum.\r\n\r\nSummer was now over. The winter ensuing, the persons sent by Nicias,\r\nreaching Athens, gave the verbal messages which had been entrusted to\r\nthem, and answered any questions that were asked them, and delivered\r\nthe letter. The clerk of the city now came forward and read out to the\r\nAthenians the letter, which was as follows:\r\n\r\n“Our past operations, Athenians, have been made known to you by many\r\nother letters; it is now time for you to become equally familiar with\r\nour present condition, and to take your measures accordingly. We had\r\ndefeated in most of our engagements with them the Syracusans, against\r\nwhom we were sent, and we had built the works which we now occupy, when\r\nGylippus arrived from Lacedaemon with an army obtained from Peloponnese\r\nand from some of the cities in Sicily. In our first battle with him we\r\nwere victorious; in the battle on the following day we were overpowered\r\nby a multitude of cavalry and darters, and compelled to retire within\r\nour lines. We have now, therefore, been forced by the numbers of those\r\nopposed to us to discontinue the work of circumvallation, and to remain\r\ninactive; being unable to make use even of all the force we have, since\r\na large portion of our heavy infantry is absorbed in the defence of our\r\nlines. Meanwhile the enemy have carried a single wall past our lines,\r\nthus making it impossible for us to invest them in future, until this\r\ncross wall be attacked by a strong force and captured. So that the\r\nbesieger in name has become, at least from the land side, the besieged\r\nin reality; as we are prevented by their cavalry from even going for\r\nany distance into the country.\r\n\r\n“Besides this, an embassy has been dispatched to Peloponnese to procure\r\nreinforcements, and Gylippus has gone to the cities in Sicily, partly\r\nin the hope of inducing those that are at present neutral to join him\r\nin the war, partly of bringing from his allies additional contingents\r\nfor the land forces and material for the navy. For I understand that\r\nthey contemplate a combined attack, upon our lines with their land\r\nforces and with their fleet by sea. You must none of you be surprised\r\nthat I say by sea also. They have discovered that the length of the\r\ntime we have now been in commission has rotted our ships and wasted our\r\ncrews, and that with the entireness of our crews and the soundness of\r\nour ships the pristine efficiency of our navy has departed. For it is\r\nimpossible for us to haul our ships ashore and careen them, because,\r\nthe enemy’s vessels being as many or more than our own, we are\r\nconstantly anticipating an attack. Indeed, they may be seen exercising,\r\nand it lies with them to take the initiative; and not having to\r\nmaintain a blockade, they have greater facilities for drying their\r\nships.\r\n\r\n“This we should scarcely be able to do, even if we had plenty of ships\r\nto spare, and were freed from our present necessity of exhausting all\r\nour strength upon the blockade. For it is already difficult to carry in\r\nsupplies past Syracuse; and were we to relax our vigilance in the\r\nslightest degree it would become impossible. The losses which our crews\r\nhave suffered and still continue to suffer arise from the following\r\ncauses. Expeditions for fuel and for forage, and the distance from\r\nwhich water has to be fetched, cause our sailors to be cut off by the\r\nSyracusan cavalry; the loss of our previous superiority emboldens our\r\nslaves to desert; our foreign seamen are impressed by the unexpected\r\nappearance of a navy against us, and the strength of the enemy’s\r\nresistance; such of them as were pressed into the service take the\r\nfirst opportunity of departing to their respective cities; such as were\r\noriginally seduced by the temptation of high pay, and expected little\r\nfighting and large gains, leave us either by desertion to the enemy or\r\nby availing themselves of one or other of the various facilities of\r\nescape which the magnitude of Sicily affords them. Some even engage in\r\ntrade themselves and prevail upon the captains to take Hyccaric slaves\r\non board in their place; thus they have ruined the efficiency of our\r\nnavy.\r\n\r\n“Now I need not remind you that the time during which a crew is in its\r\nprime is short, and that the number of sailors who can start a ship on\r\nher way and keep the rowing in time is small. But by far my greatest\r\ntrouble is, that holding the post which I do, I am prevented by the\r\nnatural indocility of the Athenian seaman from putting a stop to these\r\nevils; and that meanwhile we have no source from which to recruit our\r\ncrews, which the enemy can do from many quarters, but are compelled to\r\ndepend both for supplying the crews in service and for making good our\r\nlosses upon the men whom we brought with us. For our present\r\nconfederates, Naxos and Catana, are incapable of supplying us. There is\r\nonly one thing more wanting to our opponents, I mean the defection of\r\nour Italian markets. If they were to see you neglect to relieve us from\r\nour present condition, and were to go over to the enemy, famine would\r\ncompel us to evacuate, and Syracuse would finish the war without a\r\nblow.\r\n\r\n“I might, it is true, have written to you something different and more\r\nagreeable than this, but nothing certainly more useful, if it is\r\ndesirable for you to know the real state of things here before taking\r\nyour measures. Besides I know that it is your nature to love to be told\r\nthe best side of things, and then to blame the teller if the\r\nexpectations which he has raised in your minds are not answered by the\r\nresult; and I therefore thought it safest to declare to you the truth.\r\n\r\n“Now you are not to think that either your generals or your soldiers\r\nhave ceased to be a match for the forces originally opposed to them.\r\nBut you are to reflect that a general Sicilian coalition is being\r\nformed against us; that a fresh army is expected from Peloponnese,\r\nwhile the force we have here is unable to cope even with our present\r\nantagonists; and you must promptly decide either to recall us or to\r\nsend out to us another fleet and army as numerous again, with a large\r\nsum of money, and someone to succeed me, as a disease in the kidneys\r\nunfits me for retaining my post. I have, I think, some claim on your\r\nindulgence, as while I was in my prime I did you much good service in\r\nmy commands. But whatever you mean to do, do it at the commencement of\r\nspring and without delay, as the enemy will obtain his Sicilian\r\nreinforcements shortly, those from Peloponnese after a longer interval;\r\nand unless you attend to the matter the former will be here before you,\r\nwhile the latter will elude you as they have done before.”\r\n\r\nSuch were the contents of Nicias’s letter. When the Athenians had heard\r\nit they refused to accept his resignation, but chose him two\r\ncolleagues, naming Menander and Euthydemus, two of the officers at the\r\nseat of war, to fill their places until their arrival, that Nicias\r\nmight not be left alone in his sickness to bear the whole weight of\r\naffairs. They also voted to send out another army and navy, drawn\r\npartly from the Athenians on the muster-roll, partly from the allies.\r\nThe colleagues chosen for Nicias were Demosthenes, son of Alcisthenes,\r\nand Eurymedon, son of Thucles. Eurymedon was sent off at once, about\r\nthe time of the winter solstice, with ten ships, a hundred and twenty\r\ntalents of silver, and instructions to tell the army that\r\nreinforcements would arrive, and that care would be taken of them; but\r\nDemosthenes stayed behind to organize the expedition, meaning to start\r\nas soon as it was spring, and sent for troops to the allies, and\r\nmeanwhile got together money, ships, and heavy infantry at home.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians also sent twenty vessels round Peloponnese to prevent any\r\none crossing over to Sicily from Corinth or Peloponnese. For the\r\nCorinthians, filled with confidence by the favourable alteration in\r\nSicilian affairs which had been reported by the envoys upon their\r\narrival, and convinced that the fleet which they had before sent out\r\nhad not been without its use, were now preparing to dispatch a force of\r\nheavy infantry in merchant vessels to Sicily, while the Lacedaemonians\r\ndid the like for the rest of Peloponnese. The Corinthians also manned a\r\nfleet of twenty-five vessels, intending to try the result of a battle\r\nwith the squadron on guard at Naupactus, and meanwhile to make it less\r\neasy for the Athenians there to hinder the departure of their\r\nmerchantmen, by obliging them to keep an eye upon the galleys thus\r\narrayed against them.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Lacedaemonians prepared for their invasion of\r\nAttica, in accordance with their own previous resolve, and at the\r\ninstigation of the Syracusans and Corinthians, who wished for an\r\ninvasion to arrest the reinforcements which they heard that Athens was\r\nabout to send to Sicily. Alcibiades also urgently advised the\r\nfortification of Decelea, and a vigorous prosecution of the war. But\r\nthe Lacedaemonians derived most encouragement from the belief that\r\nAthens, with two wars on her hands, against themselves and against the\r\nSiceliots, would be more easy to subdue, and from the conviction that\r\nshe had been the first to infringe the truce. In the former war, they\r\nconsidered, the offence had been more on their own side, both on\r\naccount of the entrance of the Thebans into Plataea in time of peace,\r\nand also of their own refusal to listen to the Athenian offer of\r\narbitration, in spite of the clause in the former treaty that where\r\narbitration should be offered there should be no appeal to arms. For\r\nthis reason they thought that they deserved their misfortunes, and took\r\nto heart seriously the disaster at Pylos and whatever else had befallen\r\nthem. But when, besides the ravages from Pylos, which went on without\r\nany intermission, the thirty Athenian ships came out from Argos and\r\nwasted part of Epidaurus, Prasiae, and other places; when upon every\r\ndispute that arose as to the interpretation of any doubtful point in\r\nthe treaty, their own offers of arbitration were always rejected by the\r\nAthenians, the Lacedaemonians at length decided that Athens had now\r\ncommitted the very same offence as they had before done, and had become\r\nthe guilty party; and they began to be full of ardour for the war. They\r\nspent this winter in sending round to their allies for iron, and in\r\ngetting ready the other implements for building their fort; and\r\nmeanwhile began raising at home, and also by forced requisitions in the\r\nrest of Peloponnese, a force to be sent out in the merchantmen to their\r\nallies in Sicily. Winter thus ended, and with it the eighteenth year of\r\nthis war of which Thucydides is the historian.\r\n\r\nIn the first days of the spring following, at an earlier period than\r\nusual, the Lacedaemonians and their allies invaded Attica, under the\r\ncommand of Agis, son of Archidamus, king of the Lacedaemonians. They\r\nbegan by devastating the parts bordering upon the plain, and next\r\nproceeded to fortify Decelea, dividing the work among the different\r\ncities. Decelea is about thirteen or fourteen miles from the city of\r\nAthens, and the same distance or not much further from Boeotia; and the\r\nfort was meant to annoy the plain and the richest parts of the country,\r\nbeing in sight of Athens. While the Peloponnesians and their allies in\r\nAttica were engaged in the work of fortification, their countrymen at\r\nhome sent off, at about the same time, the heavy infantry in the\r\nmerchant vessels to Sicily; the Lacedaemonians furnishing a picked\r\nforce of Helots and Neodamodes (or freedmen), six hundred heavy\r\ninfantry in all, under the command of Eccritus, a Spartan; and the\r\nBoeotians three hundred heavy infantry, commanded by two Thebans, Xenon\r\nand Nicon, and by Hegesander, a Thespian. These were among the first to\r\nput out into the open sea, starting from Taenarus in Laconia. Not long\r\nafter their departure the Corinthians sent off a force of five hundred\r\nheavy infantry, consisting partly of men from Corinth itself, and\r\npartly of Arcadian mercenaries, placed under the command of Alexarchus,\r\na Corinthian. The Sicyonians also sent off two hundred heavy infantry\r\nat same time as the Corinthians, under the command of Sargeus, a\r\nSicyonian. Meantime the five-and-twenty vessels manned by Corinth\r\nduring the winter lay confronting the twenty Athenian ships at\r\nNaupactus until the heavy infantry in the merchantmen were fairly on\r\ntheir way from Peloponnese; thus fulfilling the object for which they\r\nhad been manned originally, which was to divert the attention of the\r\nAthenians from the merchantmen to the galleys.\r\n\r\nDuring this time the Athenians were not idle. Simultaneously with the\r\nfortification of Decelea, at the very beginning of spring, they sent\r\nthirty ships round Peloponnese, under Charicles, son of Apollodorus,\r\nwith instructions to call at Argos and demand a force of their heavy\r\ninfantry for the fleet, agreeably to the alliance. At the same time\r\nthey dispatched Demosthenes to Sicily, as they had intended, with sixty\r\nAthenian and five Chian vessels, twelve hundred Athenian heavy infantry\r\nfrom the muster-roll, and as many of the islanders as could be raised\r\nin the different quarters, drawing upon the other subject allies for\r\nwhatever they could supply that would be of use for the war.\r\nDemosthenes was instructed first to sail round with Charicles and to\r\noperate with him upon the coasts of Laconia, and accordingly sailed to\r\nAegina and there waited for the remainder of his armament, and for\r\nCharicles to fetch the Argive troops.\r\n\r\nIn Sicily, about the same time in this spring, Gylippus came to\r\nSyracuse with as many troops as he could bring from the cities which he\r\nhad persuaded to join. Calling the Syracusans together, he told them\r\nthat they must man as many ships as possible, and try their hand at a\r\nsea-fight, by which he hoped to achieve an advantage in the war not\r\nunworthy of the risk. With him Hermocrates actively joined in trying to\r\nencourage his countrymen to attack the Athenians at sea, saying that\r\nthe latter had not inherited their naval prowess nor would they retain\r\nit for ever; they had been landsmen even to a greater degree than the\r\nSyracusans, and had only become a maritime power when obliged by the\r\nMede. Besides, to daring spirits like the Athenians, a daring adversary\r\nwould seem the most formidable; and the Athenian plan of paralysing by\r\nthe boldness of their attack a neighbour often not their inferior in\r\nstrength could now be used against them with as good effect by the\r\nSyracusans. He was convinced also that the unlooked-for spectacle of\r\nSyracusans daring to face the Athenian navy would cause a terror to the\r\nenemy, the advantages of which would far outweigh any loss that\r\nAthenian science might inflict upon their inexperience. He accordingly\r\nurged them to throw aside their fears and to try their fortune at sea;\r\nand the Syracusans, under the influence of Gylippus and Hermocrates,\r\nand perhaps some others, made up their minds for the sea-fight and\r\nbegan to man their vessels.\r\n\r\nWhen the fleet was ready, Gylippus led out the whole army by night; his\r\nplan being to assault in person the forts on Plemmyrium by land, while\r\nthirty-five Syracusan galleys sailed according to appointment against\r\nthe enemy from the great harbour, and the forty-five remaining came\r\nround from the lesser harbour, where they had their arsenal, in order\r\nto effect a junction with those inside and simultaneously to attack\r\nPlemmyrium, and thus to distract the Athenians by assaulting them on\r\ntwo sides at once. The Athenians quickly manned sixty ships, and with\r\ntwenty-five of these engaged the thirty-five of the Syracusans in the\r\ngreat harbour, sending the rest to meet those sailing round from the\r\narsenal; and an action now ensued directly in front of the mouth of the\r\ngreat harbour, maintained with equal tenacity on both sides; the one\r\nwishing to force the passage, the other to prevent them.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, while the Athenians in Plemmyrium were down at the\r\nsea, attending to the engagement, Gylippus made a sudden attack on the\r\nforts in the early morning and took the largest first, and afterwards\r\nthe two smaller, whose garrisons did not wait for him, seeing the\r\nlargest so easily taken. At the fall of the first fort, the men from it\r\nwho succeeded in taking refuge in their boats and merchantmen, found\r\ngreat difficulty in reaching the camp, as the Syracusans were having\r\nthe best of it in the engagement in the great harbour, and sent a\r\nfast-sailing galley to pursue them. But when the two others fell, the\r\nSyracusans were now being defeated; and the fugitives from these sailed\r\nalongshore with more ease. The Syracusan ships fighting off the mouth\r\nof the harbour forced their way through the Athenian vessels and\r\nsailing in without any order fell foul of one another, and transferred\r\nthe victory to the Athenians; who not only routed the squadron in\r\nquestion, but also that by which they were at first being defeated in\r\nthe harbour, sinking eleven of the Syracusan vessels and killing most\r\nof the men, except the crews of three ships whom they made prisoners.\r\nTheir own loss was confined to three vessels; and after hauling ashore\r\nthe Syracusan wrecks and setting up a trophy upon the islet in front of\r\nPlemmyrium, they retired to their own camp.\r\n\r\nUnsuccessful at sea, the Syracusans had nevertheless the forts in\r\nPlemmyrium, for which they set up three trophies. One of the two last\r\ntaken they razed, but put in order and garrisoned the two others. In\r\nthe capture of the forts a great many men were killed and made\r\nprisoners, and a great quantity of property was taken in all. As the\r\nAthenians had used them as a magazine, there was a large stock of goods\r\nand corn of the merchants inside, and also a large stock belonging to\r\nthe captains; the masts and other furniture of forty galleys being\r\ntaken, besides three galleys which had been drawn up on shore. Indeed\r\nthe first and chiefest cause of the ruin of the Athenian army was the\r\ncapture of Plemmyrium; even the entrance of the harbour being now no\r\nlonger safe for carrying in provisions, as the Syracusan vessels were\r\nstationed there to prevent it, and nothing could be brought in without\r\nfighting; besides the general impression of dismay and discouragement\r\nproduced upon the army.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Syracusans sent out twelve ships under the command of\r\nAgatharchus, a Syracusan. One of these went to Peloponnese with\r\nambassadors to describe the hopeful state of their affairs, and to\r\nincite the Peloponnesians to prosecute the war there even more actively\r\nthan they were now doing, while the eleven others sailed to Italy,\r\nhearing that vessels laden with stores were on their way to the\r\nAthenians. After falling in with and destroying most of the vessels in\r\nquestion, and burning in the Caulonian territory a quantity of timber\r\nfor shipbuilding, which had been got ready for the Athenians, the\r\nSyracusan squadron went to Locri, and one of the merchantmen from\r\nPeloponnese coming in, while they were at anchor there, carrying\r\nThespian heavy infantry, took these on board and sailed alongshore\r\ntowards home. The Athenians were on the look-out for them with twenty\r\nships at Megara, but were only able to take one vessel with its crew;\r\nthe rest getting clear off to Syracuse. There was also some skirmishing\r\nin the harbour about the piles which the Syracusans had driven in the\r\nsea in front of the old docks, to allow their ships to lie at anchor\r\ninside, without being hurt by the Athenians sailing up and running them\r\ndown. The Athenians brought up to them a ship of ten thousand talents\r\nburden furnished with wooden turrets and screens, and fastened ropes\r\nround the piles from their boats, wrenched them up and broke them, or\r\ndived down and sawed them in two. Meanwhile the Syracusans plied them\r\nwith missiles from the docks, to which they replied from their large\r\nvessel; until at last most of the piles were removed by the Athenians.\r\nBut the most awkward part of the stockade was the part out of sight:\r\nsome of the piles which had been driven in did not appear above water,\r\nso that it was dangerous to sail up, for fear of running the ships upon\r\nthem, just as upon a reef, through not seeing them. However divers went\r\ndown and sawed off even these for reward; although the Syracusans drove\r\nin others. Indeed there was no end to the contrivances to which they\r\nresorted against each other, as might be expected between two hostile\r\narmies confronting each other at such a short distance: and skirmishes\r\nand all kinds of other attempts were of constant occurrence. Meanwhile\r\nthe Syracusans sent embassies to the cities, composed of Corinthians,\r\nAmbraciots, and Lacedaemonians, to tell them of the capture of\r\nPlemmyrium, and that their defeat in the sea-fight was due less to the\r\nstrength of the enemy than to their own disorder; and generally, to let\r\nthem know that they were full of hope, and to desire them to come to\r\ntheir help with ships and troops, as the Athenians were expected with a\r\nfresh army, and if the one already there could be destroyed before the\r\nother arrived, the war would be at an end.\r\n\r\nWhile the contending parties in Sicily were thus engaged, Demosthenes,\r\nhaving now got together the armament with which he was to go to the\r\nisland, put out from Aegina, and making sail for Peloponnese, joined\r\nCharicles and the thirty ships of the Athenians. Taking on board the\r\nheavy infantry from Argos they sailed to Laconia, and, after first\r\nplundering part of Epidaurus Limera, landed on the coast of Laconia,\r\nopposite Cythera, where the temple of Apollo stands, and, laying waste\r\npart of the country, fortified a sort of isthmus, to which the Helots\r\nof the Lacedaemonians might desert, and from whence plundering\r\nincursions might be made as from Pylos. Demosthenes helped to occupy\r\nthis place, and then immediately sailed on to Corcyra to take up some\r\nof the allies in that island, and so to proceed without delay to\r\nSicily; while Charicles waited until he had completed the fortification\r\nof the place and, leaving a garrison there, returned home subsequently\r\nwith his thirty ships and the Argives also.\r\n\r\nThis same summer arrived at Athens thirteen hundred targeteers,\r\nThracian swordsmen of the tribe of the Dii, who were to have sailed to\r\nSicily with Demosthenes. Since they had come too late, the Athenians\r\ndetermined to send them back to Thrace, whence they had come; to keep\r\nthem for the Decelean war appearing too expensive, as the pay of each\r\nman was a drachma a day. Indeed since Decelea had been first fortified\r\nby the whole Peloponnesian army during this summer, and then occupied\r\nfor the annoyance of the country by the garrisons from the cities\r\nrelieving each other at stated intervals, it had been doing great\r\nmischief to the Athenians; in fact this occupation, by the destruction\r\nof property and loss of men which resulted from it, was one of the\r\nprincipal causes of their ruin. Previously the invasions were short,\r\nand did not prevent their enjoying their land during the rest of the\r\ntime: the enemy was now permanently fixed in Attica; at one time it was\r\nan attack in force, at another it was the regular garrison overrunning\r\nthe country and making forays for its subsistence, and the\r\nLacedaemonian king, Agis, was in the field and diligently prosecuting\r\nthe war; great mischief was therefore done to the Athenians. They were\r\ndeprived of their whole country: more than twenty thousand slaves had\r\ndeserted, a great part of them artisans, and all their sheep and beasts\r\nof burden were lost; and as the cavalry rode out daily upon excursions\r\nto Decelea and to guard the country, their horses were either lamed by\r\nbeing constantly worked upon rocky ground, or wounded by the enemy.\r\n\r\nBesides, the transport of provisions from Euboea, which had before been\r\ncarried on so much more quickly overland by Decelea from Oropus, was\r\nnow effected at great cost by sea round Sunium; everything the city\r\nrequired had to be imported from abroad, and instead of a city it\r\nbecame a fortress. Summer and winter the Athenians were worn out by\r\nhaving to keep guard on the fortifications, during the day by turns, by\r\nnight all together, the cavalry excepted, at the different military\r\nposts or upon the wall. But what most oppressed them was that they had\r\ntwo wars at once, and had thus reached a pitch of frenzy which no one\r\nwould have believed possible if he had heard of it before it had come\r\nto pass. For could any one have imagined that even when besieged by the\r\nPeloponnesians entrenched in Attica, they would still, instead of\r\nwithdrawing from Sicily, stay on there besieging in like manner\r\nSyracuse, a town (taken as a town) in no way inferior to Athens, or\r\nwould so thoroughly upset the Hellenic estimate of their strength and\r\naudacity, as to give the spectacle of a people which, at the beginning\r\nof the war, some thought might hold out one year, some two, none more\r\nthan three, if the Peloponnesians invaded their country, now seventeen\r\nyears after the first invasion, after having already suffered from all\r\nthe evils of war, going to Sicily and undertaking a new war nothing\r\ninferior to that which they already had with the Peloponnesians? These\r\ncauses, the great losses from Decelea, and the other heavy charges that\r\nfell upon them, produced their financial embarrassment; and it was at\r\nthis time that they imposed upon their subjects, instead of the\r\ntribute, the tax of a twentieth upon all imports and exports by sea,\r\nwhich they thought would bring them in more money; their expenditure\r\nbeing now not the same as at first, but having grown with the war while\r\ntheir revenues decayed.\r\n\r\nAccordingly, not wishing to incur expense in their present want of\r\nmoney, they sent back at once the Thracians who came too late for\r\nDemosthenes, under the conduct of Diitrephes, who was instructed, as\r\nthey were to pass through the Euripus, to make use of them if possible\r\nin the voyage alongshore to injure the enemy. Diitrephes first landed\r\nthem at Tanagra and hastily snatched some booty; he then sailed across\r\nthe Euripus in the evening from Chalcis in Euboea and disembarking in\r\nBoeotia led them against Mycalessus. The night he passed unobserved\r\nnear the temple of Hermes, not quite two miles from Mycalessus, and at\r\ndaybreak assaulted and took the town, which is not a large one; the\r\ninhabitants being off their guard and not expecting that any one would\r\never come up so far from the sea to molest them, the wall too being\r\nweak, and in some places having tumbled down, while in others it had\r\nnot been built to any height, and the gates also being left open\r\nthrough their feeling of security. The Thracians bursting into\r\nMycalessus sacked the houses and temples, and butchered the\r\ninhabitants, sparing neither youth nor age, but killing all they fell\r\nin with, one after the other, children and women, and even beasts of\r\nburden, and whatever other living creatures they saw; the Thracian\r\nrace, like the bloodiest of the barbarians, being even more so when it\r\nhas nothing to fear. Everywhere confusion reigned and death in all its\r\nshapes; and in particular they attacked a boys’ school, the largest\r\nthat there was in the place, into which the children had just gone, and\r\nmassacred them all. In short, the disaster falling upon the whole town\r\nwas unsurpassed in magnitude, and unapproached by any in suddenness and\r\nin horror.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Thebans heard of it and marched to the rescue, and\r\novertaking the Thracians before they had gone far, recovered the\r\nplunder and drove them in panic to the Euripus and the sea, where the\r\nvessels which brought them were lying. The greatest slaughter took\r\nplace while they were embarking, as they did not know how to swim, and\r\nthose in the vessels on seeing what was going on on on shore moored\r\nthem out of bowshot: in the rest of the retreat the Thracians made a\r\nvery respectable defence against the Theban horse, by which they were\r\nfirst attacked, dashing out and closing their ranks according to the\r\ntactics of their country, and lost only a few men in that part of the\r\naffair. A good number who were after plunder were actually caught in\r\nthe town and put to death. Altogether the Thracians had two hundred and\r\nfifty killed out of thirteen hundred, the Thebans and the rest who came\r\nto the rescue about twenty, troopers and heavy infantry, with\r\nScirphondas, one of the Boeotarchs. The Mycalessians lost a large\r\nproportion of their population.\r\n\r\nWhile Mycalessus thus experienced a calamity for its extent as\r\nlamentable as any that happened in the war, Demosthenes, whom we left\r\nsailing to Corcyra, after the building of the fort in Laconia, found a\r\nmerchantman lying at Phea in Elis, in which the Corinthian heavy\r\ninfantry were to cross to Sicily. The ship he destroyed, but the men\r\nescaped, and subsequently got another in which they pursued their\r\nvoyage. After this, arriving at Zacynthus and Cephallenia, he took a\r\nbody of heavy infantry on board, and sending for some of the Messenians\r\nfrom Naupactus, crossed over to the opposite coast of Acarnania, to\r\nAlyzia, and to Anactorium which was held by the Athenians. While he was\r\nin these parts he was met by Eurymedon returning from Sicily, where he\r\nhad been sent, as has been mentioned, during the winter, with the money\r\nfor the army, who told him the news, and also that he had heard, while\r\nat sea, that the Syracusans had taken Plemmyrium. Here, also, Conon\r\ncame to them, the commander at Naupactus, with news that the\r\ntwenty-five Corinthian ships stationed opposite to him, far from giving\r\nover the war, were meditating an engagement; and he therefore begged\r\nthem to send him some ships, as his own eighteen were not a match for\r\nthe enemy’s twenty-five. Demosthenes and Eurymedon, accordingly, sent\r\nten of their best sailers with Conon to reinforce the squadron at\r\nNaupactus, and meanwhile prepared for the muster of their forces;\r\nEurymedon, who was now the colleague of Demosthenes, and had turned\r\nback in consequence of his appointment, sailing to Corcyra to tell them\r\nto man fifteen ships and to enlist heavy infantry; while Demosthenes\r\nraised slingers and darters from the parts about Acarnania.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the envoys, already mentioned, who had gone from Syracuse to\r\nthe cities after the capture of Plemmyrium, had succeeded in their\r\nmission, and were about to bring the army that they had collected, when\r\nNicias got scent of it, and sent to the Centoripae and Alicyaeans and\r\nother of the friendly Sicels, who held the passes, not to let the enemy\r\nthrough, but to combine to prevent their passing, there being no other\r\nway by which they could even attempt it, as the Agrigentines would not\r\ngive them a passage through their country. Agreeably to this request\r\nthe Sicels laid a triple ambuscade for the Siceliots upon their march,\r\nand attacking them suddenly, while off their guard, killed about eight\r\nhundred of them and all the envoys, the Corinthian only excepted, by\r\nwhom fifteen hundred who escaped were conducted to Syracuse.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Camarinaeans also came to the assistance of\r\nSyracuse with five hundred heavy infantry, three hundred darters, and\r\nas many archers, while the Geloans sent crews for five ships, four\r\nhundred darters, and two hundred horse. Indeed almost the whole of\r\nSicily, except the Agrigentines, who were neutral, now ceased merely to\r\nwatch events as it had hitherto done, and actively joined Syracuse\r\nagainst the Athenians.\r\n\r\nWhile the Syracusans after the Sicel disaster put off any immediate\r\nattack upon the Athenians, Demosthenes and Eurymedon, whose forces from\r\nCorcyra and the continent were now ready, crossed the Ionian Gulf with\r\nall their armament to the Iapygian promontory, and starting from thence\r\ntouched at the Choerades Isles lying off Iapygia, where they took on\r\nboard a hundred and fifty Iapygian darters of the Messapian tribe, and\r\nafter renewing an old friendship with Artas the chief, who had\r\nfurnished them with the darters, arrived at Metapontium in Italy. Here\r\nthey persuaded their allies the Metapontines to send with them three\r\nhundred darters and two galleys, and with this reinforcement coasted on\r\nto Thurii, where they found the party hostile to Athens recently\r\nexpelled by a revolution, and accordingly remained there to muster and\r\nreview the whole army, to see if any had been left behind, and to\r\nprevail upon the Thurians resolutely to join them in their expedition,\r\nand in the circumstances in which they found themselves to conclude a\r\ndefensive and offensive alliance with the Athenians.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the Peloponnesians in the twenty-five ships\r\nstationed opposite to the squadron at Naupactus to protect the passage\r\nof the transports to Sicily had got ready for engaging, and manning\r\nsome additional vessels, so as to be numerically little inferior to the\r\nAthenians, anchored off Erineus in Achaia in the Rhypic country. The\r\nplace off which they lay being in the form of a crescent, the land\r\nforces furnished by the Corinthians and their allies on the spot came\r\nup and ranged themselves upon the projecting headlands on either side,\r\nwhile the fleet, under the command of Polyanthes, a Corinthian, held\r\nthe intervening space and blocked up the entrance. The Athenians under\r\nDiphilus now sailed out against them with thirty-three ships from\r\nNaupactus, and the Corinthians, at first not moving, at length thought\r\nthey saw their opportunity, raised the signal, and advanced and engaged\r\nthe Athenians. After an obstinate struggle, the Corinthians lost three\r\nships, and without sinking any altogether, disabled seven of the enemy,\r\nwhich were struck prow to prow and had their foreships stove in by the\r\nCorinthian vessels, whose cheeks had been strengthened for this very\r\npurpose. After an action of this even character, in which either party\r\ncould claim the victory (although the Athenians became masters of the\r\nwrecks through the wind driving them out to sea, the Corinthians not\r\nputting out again to meet them), the two combatants parted. No pursuit\r\ntook place, and no prisoners were made on either side; the Corinthians\r\nand Peloponnesians who were fighting near the shore escaping with ease,\r\nand none of the Athenian vessels having been sunk. The Athenians now\r\nsailed back to Naupactus, and the Corinthians immediately set up a\r\ntrophy as victors, because they had disabled a greater number of the\r\nenemy’s ships. Moreover they held that they had not been worsted, for\r\nthe very same reason that their opponent held that he had not been\r\nvictorious; the Corinthians considering that they were conquerors, if\r\nnot decidedly conquered, and the Athenians thinking themselves\r\nvanquished, because not decidedly victorious. However, when the\r\nPeloponnesians sailed off and their land forces had dispersed, the\r\nAthenians also set up a trophy as victors in Achaia, about two miles\r\nand a quarter from Erineus, the Corinthian station.\r\n\r\nThis was the termination of the action at Naupactus. To return to\r\nDemosthenes and Eurymedon: the Thurians having now got ready to join in\r\nthe expedition with seven hundred heavy infantry and three hundred\r\ndarters, the two generals ordered the ships to sail along the coast to\r\nthe Crotonian territory, and meanwhile held a review of all the land\r\nforces upon the river Sybaris, and then led them through the Thurian\r\ncountry. Arrived at the river Hylias, they here received a message from\r\nthe Crotonians, saying that they would not allow the army to pass\r\nthrough their country; upon which the Athenians descended towards the\r\nshore, and bivouacked near the sea and the mouth of the Hylias, where\r\nthe fleet also met them, and the next day embarked and sailed along the\r\ncoast touching at all the cities except Locri, until they came to Petra\r\nin the Rhegian territory.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Syracusans hearing of their approach resolved to make a\r\nsecond attempt with their fleet and their other forces on shore, which\r\nthey had been collecting for this very purpose in order to do something\r\nbefore their arrival. In addition to other improvements suggested by\r\nthe former sea-fight which they now adopted in the equipment of their\r\nnavy, they cut down their prows to a smaller compass to make them more\r\nsolid and made their cheeks stouter, and from these let stays into the\r\nvessels’ sides for a length of six cubits within and without, in the\r\nsame way as the Corinthians had altered their prows before engaging the\r\nsquadron at Naupactus. The Syracusans thought that they would thus have\r\nan advantage over the Athenian vessels, which were not constructed with\r\nequal strength, but were slight in the bows, from their being more used\r\nto sail round and charge the enemy’s side than to meet him prow to\r\nprow, and that the battle being in the great harbour, with a great many\r\nships in not much room, was also a fact in their favour. Charging prow\r\nto prow, they would stave in the enemy’s bows, by striking with solid\r\nand stout beaks against hollow and weak ones; and secondly, the\r\nAthenians for want of room would be unable to use their favourite\r\nmanoeuvre of breaking the line or of sailing round, as the Syracusans\r\nwould do their best not to let them do the one, and want of room would\r\nprevent their doing the other. This charging prow to prow, which had\r\nhitherto been thought want of skill in a helmsman, would be the\r\nSyracusans’ chief manoeuvre, as being that which they should find most\r\nuseful, since the Athenians, if repulsed, would not be able to back\r\nwater in any direction except towards the shore, and that only for a\r\nlittle way, and in the little space in front of their own camp. The\r\nrest of the harbour would be commanded by the Syracusans; and the\r\nAthenians, if hard pressed, by crowding together in a small space and\r\nall to the same point, would run foul of one another and fall into\r\ndisorder, which was, in fact, the thing that did the Athenians most\r\nharm in all the sea-fights, they not having, like the Syracusans, the\r\nwhole harbour to retreat over. As to their sailing round into the open\r\nsea, this would be impossible, with the Syracusans in possession of the\r\nway out and in, especially as Plemmyrium would be hostile to them, and\r\nthe mouth of the harbour was not large.\r\n\r\nWith these contrivances to suit their skill and ability, and now more\r\nconfident after the previous sea-fight, the Syracusans attacked by land\r\nand sea at once. The town force Gylippus led out a little the first and\r\nbrought them up to the wall of the Athenians, where it looked towards\r\nthe city, while the force from the Olympieum, that is to say, the heavy\r\ninfantry that were there with the horse and the light troops of the\r\nSyracusans, advanced against the wall from the opposite side; the ships\r\nof the Syracusans and allies sailing out immediately afterwards. The\r\nAthenians at first fancied that they were to be attacked by land only,\r\nand it was not without alarm that they saw the fleet suddenly\r\napproaching as well; and while some were forming upon the walls and in\r\nfront of them against the advancing enemy, and some marching out in\r\nhaste against the numbers of horse and darters coming from the\r\nOlympieum and from outside, others manned the ships or rushed down to\r\nthe beach to oppose the enemy, and when the ships were manned put out\r\nwith seventy-five sail against about eighty of the Syracusans.\r\n\r\nAfter spending a great part of the day in advancing and retreating and\r\nskirmishing with each other, without either being able to gain any\r\nadvantage worth speaking of, except that the Syracusans sank one or two\r\nof the Athenian vessels, they parted, the land force at the same time\r\nretiring from the lines. The next day the Syracusans remained quiet,\r\nand gave no signs of what they were going to do; but Nicias, seeing\r\nthat the battle had been a drawn one, and expecting that they would\r\nattack again, compelled the captains to refit any of the ships that had\r\nsuffered, and moored merchant vessels before the stockade which they\r\nhad driven into the sea in front of their ships, to serve instead of an\r\nenclosed harbour, at about two hundred feet from each other, in order\r\nthat any ship that was hard pressed might be able to retreat in safety\r\nand sail out again at leisure. These preparations occupied the\r\nAthenians all day until nightfall.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Syracusans began operations at an earlier hour, but\r\nwith the same plan of attack by land and sea. A great part of the day\r\nthe rivals spent as before, confronting and skirmishing with each\r\nother; until at last Ariston, son of Pyrrhicus, a Corinthian, the\r\nablest helmsman in the Syracusan service, persuaded their naval\r\ncommanders to send to the officials in the city, and tell them to move\r\nthe sale market as quickly as they could down to the sea, and oblige\r\nevery one to bring whatever eatables he had and sell them there, thus\r\nenabling the commanders to land the crews and dine at once close to the\r\nships, and shortly afterwards, the selfsame day, to attack the\r\nAthenians again when they were not expecting it.\r\n\r\nIn compliance with this advice a messenger was sent and the market got\r\nready, upon which the Syracusans suddenly backed water and withdrew to\r\nthe town, and at once landed and took their dinner upon the spot; while\r\nthe Athenians, supposing that they had returned to the town because\r\nthey felt they were beaten, disembarked at their leisure and set about\r\ngetting their dinners and about their other occupations, under the idea\r\nthat they done with fighting for that day. Suddenly the Syracusans had\r\nmanned their ships and again sailed against them; and the Athenians, in\r\ngreat confusion and most of them fasting, got on board, and with great\r\ndifficulty put out to meet them. For some time both parties remained on\r\nthe defensive without engaging, until the Athenians at last resolved\r\nnot to let themselves be worn out by waiting where they were, but to\r\nattack without delay, and giving a cheer, went into action. The\r\nSyracusans received them, and charging prow to prow as they had\r\nintended, stove in a great part of the Athenian foreships by the\r\nstrength of their beaks; the darters on the decks also did great damage\r\nto the Athenians, but still greater damage was done by the Syracusans\r\nwho went about in small boats, ran in upon the oars of the Athenian\r\ngalleys, and sailed against their sides, and discharged from thence\r\ntheir darts upon the sailors.\r\n\r\nAt last, fighting hard in this fashion, the Syracusans gained the\r\nvictory, and the Athenians turned and fled between the merchantmen to\r\ntheir own station. The Syracusan ships pursued them as far as the\r\nmerchantmen, where they were stopped by the beams armed with dolphins\r\nsuspended from those vessels over the passage. Two of the Syracusan\r\nvessels went too near in the excitement of victory and were destroyed,\r\none of them being taken with its crew. After sinking seven of the\r\nAthenian vessels and disabling many, and taking most of the men\r\nprisoners and killing others, the Syracusans retired and set up\r\ntrophies for both the engagements, being now confident of having a\r\ndecided superiority by sea, and by no means despairing of equal success\r\nby land.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII\r\n\r\n\r\nNineteenth Year of the War—Arrival of Demosthenes—Defeat of the\r\nAthenians at Epipolae—Folly and Obstinancy of Nicias\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the meantime, while the Syracusans were preparing for a second\r\nattack upon both elements, Demosthenes and Eurymedon arrived with the\r\nsuccours from Athens, consisting of about seventy-three ships,\r\nincluding the foreigners; nearly five thousand heavy infantry, Athenian\r\nand allied; a large number of darters, Hellenic and barbarian, and\r\nslingers and archers and everything else upon a corresponding scale.\r\nThe Syracusans and their allies were for the moment not a little\r\ndismayed at the idea that there was to be no term or ending to their\r\ndangers, seeing, in spite of the fortification of Decelea, a new army\r\narrive nearly equal to the former, and the power of Athens proving so\r\ngreat in every quarter. On the other hand, the first Athenian armament\r\nregained a certain confidence in the midst of its misfortunes.\r\nDemosthenes, seeing how matters stood, felt that he could not drag on\r\nand fare as Nicias had done, who by wintering in Catana instead of at\r\nonce attacking Syracuse had allowed the terror of his first arrival to\r\nevaporate in contempt, and had given time to Gylippus to arrive with a\r\nforce from Peloponnese, which the Syracusans would never have sent for\r\nif he had attacked immediately; for they fancied that they were a match\r\nfor him by themselves, and would not have discovered their inferiority\r\nuntil they were already invested, and even if they then sent for\r\nsuccours, they would no longer have been equally able to profit by\r\ntheir arrival. Recollecting this, and well aware that it was now on the\r\nfirst day after his arrival that he like Nicias was most formidable to\r\nthe enemy, Demosthenes determined to lose no time in drawing the utmost\r\nprofit from the consternation at the moment inspired by his army; and\r\nseeing that the counterwall of the Syracusans, which hindered the\r\nAthenians from investing them, was a single one, and that he who should\r\nbecome master of the way up to Epipolae, and afterwards of the camp\r\nthere, would find no difficulty in taking it, as no one would even wait\r\nfor his attack, made all haste to attempt the enterprise. This he took\r\nto be the shortest way of ending the war, as he would either succeed\r\nand take Syracuse, or would lead back the armament instead of\r\nfrittering away the lives of the Athenians engaged in the expedition\r\nand the resources of the country at large.\r\n\r\nFirst therefore the Athenians went out and laid waste the lands of the\r\nSyracusans about the Anapus and carried all before them as at first by\r\nland and by sea, the Syracusans not offering to oppose them upon either\r\nelement, unless it were with their cavalry and darters from the\r\nOlympieum. Next Demosthenes resolved to attempt the counterwall first\r\nby means of engines. As however the engines that he brought up were\r\nburnt by the enemy fighting from the wall, and the rest of the forces\r\nrepulsed after attacking at many different points, he determined to\r\ndelay no longer, and having obtained the consent of Nicias and his\r\nfellow commanders, proceeded to put in execution his plan of attacking\r\nEpipolae. As by day it seemed impossible to approach and get up without\r\nbeing observed, he ordered provisions for five days, took all the\r\nmasons and carpenters, and other things, such as arrows, and everything\r\nelse that they could want for the work of fortification if successful,\r\nand, after the first watch, set out with Eurymedon and Menander and the\r\nwhole army for Epipolae, Nicias being left behind in the lines. Having\r\ncome up by the hill of Euryelus (where the former army had ascended at\r\nfirst) unobserved by the enemy’s guards, they went up to the fort which\r\nthe Syracusans had there, and took it, and put to the sword part of the\r\ngarrison. The greater number, however, escaped at once and gave the\r\nalarm to the camps, of which there were three upon Epipolae, defended\r\nby outworks, one of the Syracusans, one of the other Siceliots, and one\r\nof the allies; and also to the six hundred Syracusans forming the\r\noriginal garrison for this part of Epipolae. These at once advanced\r\nagainst the assailants and, falling in with Demosthenes and the\r\nAthenians, were routed by them after a sharp resistance, the victors\r\nimmediately pushing on, eager to achieve the objects of the attack\r\nwithout giving time for their ardour to cool; meanwhile others from the\r\nvery beginning were taking the counterwall of the Syracusans, which was\r\nabandoned by its garrison, and pulling down the battlements. The\r\nSyracusans and the allies, and Gylippus with the troops under his\r\ncommand, advanced to the rescue from the outworks, but engaged in some\r\nconsternation (a night attack being a piece of audacity which they had\r\nnever expected), and were at first compelled to retreat. But while the\r\nAthenians, flushed with their victory, now advanced with less order,\r\nwishing to make their way as quickly as possible through the whole\r\nforce of the enemy not yet engaged, without relaxing their attack or\r\ngiving them time to rally, the Boeotians made the first stand against\r\nthem, attacked them, routed them, and put them to flight.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians now fell into great disorder and perplexity, so that it\r\nwas not easy to get from one side or the other any detailed account of\r\nthe affair. By day certainly the combatants have a clearer notion,\r\nthough even then by no means of all that takes place, no one knowing\r\nmuch of anything that does not go on in his own immediate\r\nneighbourhood; but in a night engagement (and this was the only one\r\nthat occurred between great armies during the war) how could any one\r\nknow anything for certain? Although there was a bright moon they saw\r\neach other only as men do by moonlight, that is to say, they could\r\ndistinguish the form of the body, but could not tell for certain\r\nwhether it was a friend or an enemy. Both had great numbers of heavy\r\ninfantry moving about in a small space. Some of the Athenians were\r\nalready defeated, while others were coming up yet unconquered for their\r\nfirst attack. A large part also of the rest of their forces either had\r\nonly just got up, or were still ascending, so that they did not know\r\nwhich way to march. Owing to the rout that had taken place all in front\r\nwas now in confusion, and the noise made it difficult to distinguish\r\nanything. The victorious Syracusans and allies were cheering each other\r\non with loud cries, by night the only possible means of communication,\r\nand meanwhile receiving all who came against them; while the Athenians\r\nwere seeking for one another, taking all in front of them for enemies,\r\neven although they might be some of their now flying friends; and by\r\nconstantly asking for the watchword, which was their only means of\r\nrecognition, not only caused great confusion among themselves by asking\r\nall at once, but also made it known to the enemy, whose own they did\r\nnot so readily discover, as the Syracusans were victorious and not\r\nscattered, and thus less easily mistaken. The result was that if the\r\nAthenians fell in with a party of the enemy that was weaker than they,\r\nit escaped them through knowing their watchword; while if they\r\nthemselves failed to answer they were put to the sword. But what hurt\r\nthem as much, or indeed more than anything else, was the singing of the\r\npaean, from the perplexity which it caused by being nearly the same on\r\neither side; the Argives and Corcyraeans and any other Dorian peoples\r\nin the army, struck terror into the Athenians whenever they raised\r\ntheir paean, no less than did the enemy. Thus, after being once thrown\r\ninto disorder, they ended by coming into collision with each other in\r\nmany parts of the field, friends with friends, and citizens with\r\ncitizens, and not only terrified one another, but even came to blows\r\nand could only be parted with difficulty. In the pursuit many perished\r\nby throwing themselves down the cliffs, the way down from Epipolae\r\nbeing narrow; and of those who got down safely into the plain, although\r\nmany, especially those who belonged to the first armament, escaped\r\nthrough their better acquaintance with the locality, some of the\r\nnewcomers lost their way and wandered over the country, and were cut\r\noff in the morning by the Syracusan cavalry and killed.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Syracusans set up two trophies, one upon Epipolae\r\nwhere the ascent had been made, and the other on the spot where the\r\nfirst check was given by the Boeotians; and the Athenians took back\r\ntheir dead under truce. A great many of the Athenians and allies were\r\nkilled, although still more arms were taken than could be accounted for\r\nby the number of the dead, as some of those who were obliged to leap\r\ndown from the cliffs without their shields escaped with their lives and\r\ndid not perish like the rest.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Syracusans, recovering their old confidence at such an\r\nunexpected stroke of good fortune, dispatched Sicanus with fifteen\r\nships to Agrigentum where there was a revolution, to induce if possible\r\nthe city to join them; while Gylippus again went by land into the rest\r\nof Sicily to bring up reinforcements, being now in hope of taking the\r\nAthenian lines by storm, after the result of the affair on Epipolae.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Athenian generals consulted upon the disaster which\r\nhad happened, and upon the general weakness of the army. They saw\r\nthemselves unsuccessful in their enterprises, and the soldiers\r\ndisgusted with their stay; disease being rife among them owing to its\r\nbeing the sickly season of the year, and to the marshy and unhealthy\r\nnature of the spot in which they were encamped; and the state of their\r\naffairs generally being thought desperate. Accordingly, Demosthenes was\r\nof opinion that they ought not to stay any longer; but agreeably to his\r\noriginal idea in risking the attempt upon Epipolae, now that this had\r\nfailed, he gave his vote for going away without further loss of time,\r\nwhile the sea might yet be crossed, and their late reinforcement might\r\ngive them the superiority at all events on that element. He also said\r\nthat it would be more profitable for the state to carry on the war\r\nagainst those who were building fortifications in Attica, than against\r\nthe Syracusans whom it was no longer easy to subdue; besides which it\r\nwas not right to squander large sums of money to no purpose by going on\r\nwith the siege.\r\n\r\nThis was the opinion of Demosthenes. Nicias, without denying the bad\r\nstate of their affairs, was unwilling to avow their weakness, or to\r\nhave it reported to the enemy that the Athenians in full council were\r\nopenly voting for retreat; for in that case they would be much less\r\nlikely to effect it when they wanted without discovery. Moreover, his\r\nown particular information still gave him reason to hope that the\r\naffairs of the enemy would soon be in a worse state than their own, if\r\nthe Athenians persevered in the siege; as they would wear out the\r\nSyracusans by want of money, especially with the more extensive command\r\nof the sea now given them by their present navy. Besides this, there\r\nwas a party in Syracuse who wished to betray the city to the Athenians,\r\nand kept sending him messages and telling him not to raise the siege.\r\nAccordingly, knowing this and really waiting because he hesitated\r\nbetween the two courses and wished to see his way more clearly, in his\r\npublic speech on this occasion he refused to lead off the army, saying\r\nhe was sure the Athenians would never approve of their returning\r\nwithout a vote of theirs. Those who would vote upon their conduct,\r\ninstead of judging the facts as eye-witnesses like themselves and not\r\nfrom what they might hear from hostile critics, would simply be guided\r\nby the calumnies of the first clever speaker; while many, indeed most,\r\nof the soldiers on the spot, who now so loudly proclaimed the danger of\r\ntheir position, when they reached Athens would proclaim just as loudly\r\nthe opposite, and would say that their generals had been bribed to\r\nbetray them and return. For himself, therefore, who knew the Athenian\r\ntemper, sooner than perish under a dishonourable charge and by an\r\nunjust sentence at the hands of the Athenians, he would rather take his\r\nchance and die, if die he must, a soldier’s death at the hand of the\r\nenemy. Besides, after all, the Syracusans were in a worse case than\r\nthemselves. What with paying mercenaries, spending upon fortified\r\nposts, and now for a full year maintaining a large navy, they were\r\nalready at a loss and would soon be at a standstill: they had already\r\nspent two thousand talents and incurred heavy debts besides, and could\r\nnot lose even ever so small a fraction of their present force through\r\nnot paying it, without ruin to their cause; depending as they did more\r\nupon mercenaries than upon soldiers obliged to serve, like their own.\r\nHe therefore said that they ought to stay and carry on the siege, and\r\nnot depart defeated in point of money, in which they were much\r\nsuperior.\r\n\r\nNicias spoke positively because he had exact information of the\r\nfinancial distress at Syracuse, and also because of the strength of the\r\nAthenian party there which kept sending him messages not to raise the\r\nsiege; besides which he had more confidence than before in his fleet,\r\nand felt sure at least of its success. Demosthenes, however, would not\r\nhear for a moment of continuing the siege, but said that if they could\r\nnot lead off the army without a decree from Athens, and if they were\r\nobliged to stay on, they ought to remove to Thapsus or Catana; where\r\ntheir land forces would have a wide extent of country to overrun, and\r\ncould live by plundering the enemy, and would thus do them damage;\r\nwhile the fleet would have the open sea to fight in, that is to say,\r\ninstead of a narrow space which was all in the enemy’s favour, a wide\r\nsea-room where their science would be of use, and where they could\r\nretreat or advance without being confined or circumscribed either when\r\nthey put out or put in. In any case he was altogether opposed to their\r\nstaying on where they were, and insisted on removing at once, as\r\nquickly and with as little delay as possible; and in this judgment\r\nEurymedon agreed. Nicias however still objecting, a certain diffidence\r\nand hesitation came over them, with a suspicion that Nicias might have\r\nsome further information to make him so positive.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIII\r\n\r\n\r\nNineteenth Year of the War—Battles in the Great Harbour—Retreat and\r\nAnnihilation of the Athenian Army\r\n\r\n\r\nWhile the Athenians lingered on in this way without moving from where\r\nthey were, Gylippus and Sicanus now arrived at Syracuse. Sicanus had\r\nfailed to gain Agrigentum, the party friendly to the Syracusans having\r\nbeen driven out while he was still at Gela; but Gylippus was\r\naccompanied not only by a large number of troops raised in Sicily, but\r\nby the heavy infantry sent off in the spring from Peloponnese in the\r\nmerchantmen, who had arrived at Selinus from Libya. They had been\r\ncarried to Libya by a storm, and having obtained two galleys and pilots\r\nfrom the Cyrenians, on their voyage alongshore had taken sides with the\r\nEuesperitae and had defeated the Libyans who were besieging them, and\r\nfrom thence coasting on to Neapolis, a Carthaginian mart, and the\r\nnearest point to Sicily, from which it is only two days’ and a night’s\r\nvoyage, there crossed over and came to Selinus. Immediately upon their\r\narrival the Syracusans prepared to attack the Athenians again by land\r\nand sea at once. The Athenian generals seeing a fresh army come to the\r\naid of the enemy, and that their own circumstances, far from improving,\r\nwere becoming daily worse, and above all distressed by the sickness of\r\nthe soldiers, now began to repent of not having removed before; and\r\nNicias no longer offering the same opposition, except by urging that\r\nthere should be no open voting, they gave orders as secretly as\r\npossible for all to be prepared to sail out from the camp at a given\r\nsignal. All was at last ready, and they were on the point of sailing\r\naway, when an eclipse of the moon, which was then at the full, took\r\nplace. Most of the Athenians, deeply impressed by this occurrence, now\r\nurged the generals to wait; and Nicias, who was somewhat over-addicted\r\nto divination and practices of that kind, refused from that moment even\r\nto take the question of departure into consideration, until they had\r\nwaited the thrice nine days prescribed by the soothsayers.\r\n\r\nThe besiegers were thus condemned to stay in the country; and the\r\nSyracusans, getting wind of what had happened, became more eager than\r\never to press the Athenians, who had now themselves acknowledged that\r\nthey were no longer their superiors either by sea or by land, as\r\notherwise they would never have planned to sail away. Besides which the\r\nSyracusans did not wish them to settle in any other part of Sicily,\r\nwhere they would be more difficult to deal with, but desired to force\r\nthem to fight at sea as quickly as possible, in a position favourable\r\nto themselves. Accordingly they manned their ships and practised for as\r\nmany days as they thought sufficient. When the moment arrived they\r\nassaulted on the first day the Athenian lines, and upon a small force\r\nof heavy infantry and horse sallying out against them by certain gates,\r\ncut off some of the former and routed and pursued them to the lines,\r\nwhere, as the entrance was narrow, the Athenians lost seventy horses\r\nand some few of the heavy infantry.\r\n\r\nDrawing off their troops for this day, on the next the Syracusans went\r\nout with a fleet of seventy-six sail, and at the same time advanced\r\nwith their land forces against the lines. The Athenians put out to meet\r\nthem with eighty-six ships, came to close quarters, and engaged. The\r\nSyracusans and their allies first defeated the Athenian centre, and\r\nthen caught Eurymedon, the commander of the right wing, who was sailing\r\nout from the line more towards the land in order to surround the enemy,\r\nin the hollow and recess of the harbour, and killed him and destroyed\r\nthe ships accompanying him; after which they now chased the whole\r\nAthenian fleet before them and drove them ashore.\r\n\r\nGylippus seeing the enemy’s fleet defeated and carried ashore beyond\r\ntheir stockades and camp, ran down to the breakwater with some of his\r\ntroops, in order to cut off the men as they landed and make it easier\r\nfor the Syracusans to tow off the vessels by the shore being friendly\r\nground. The Tyrrhenians who guarded this point for the Athenians,\r\nseeing them come on in disorder, advanced out against them and attacked\r\nand routed their van, hurling it into the marsh of Lysimeleia.\r\nAfterwards the Syracusan and allied troops arrived in greater numbers,\r\nand the Athenians fearing for their ships came up also to the rescue\r\nand engaged them, and defeated and pursued them to some distance and\r\nkilled a few of their heavy infantry. They succeeded in rescuing most\r\nof their ships and brought them down by their camp; eighteen however\r\nwere taken by the Syracusans and their allies, and all the men killed.\r\nThe rest the enemy tried to burn by means of an old merchantman which\r\nthey filled with faggots and pine-wood, set on fire, and let drift down\r\nthe wind which blew full on the Athenians. The Athenians, however,\r\nalarmed for their ships, contrived means for stopping it and putting it\r\nout, and checking the flames and the nearer approach of the\r\nmerchantman, thus escaped the danger.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Syracusans set up a trophy for the sea-fight and for the\r\nheavy infantry whom they had cut off up at the lines, where they took\r\nthe horses; and the Athenians for the rout of the foot driven by the\r\nTyrrhenians into the marsh, and for their own victory with the rest of\r\nthe army.\r\n\r\nThe Syracusans had now gained a decisive victory at sea, where until\r\nnow they had feared the reinforcement brought by Demosthenes, and deep,\r\nin consequence, was the despondency of the Athenians, and great their\r\ndisappointment, and greater still their regret for having come on the\r\nexpedition. These were the only cities that they had yet encountered,\r\nsimilar to their own in character, under democracies like themselves,\r\nwhich had ships and horses, and were of considerable magnitude. They\r\nhad been unable to divide and bring them over by holding out the\r\nprospect of changes in their governments, or to crush them by their\r\ngreat superiority in force, but had failed in most of their attempts,\r\nand being already in perplexity, had now been defeated at sea, where\r\ndefeat could never have been expected, and were thus plunged deeper in\r\nembarrassment than ever.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Syracusans immediately began to sail freely along the\r\nharbour, and determined to close up its mouth, so that the Athenians\r\nmight not be able to steal out in future, even if they wished. Indeed,\r\nthe Syracusans no longer thought only of saving themselves, but also\r\nhow to hinder the escape of the enemy; thinking, and thinking rightly,\r\nthat they were now much the stronger, and that to conquer the Athenians\r\nand their allies by land and sea would win them great glory in Hellas.\r\nThe rest of the Hellenes would thus immediately be either freed or\r\nreleased from apprehension, as the remaining forces of Athens would be\r\nhenceforth unable to sustain the war that would be waged against her;\r\nwhile they, the Syracusans, would be regarded as the authors of this\r\ndeliverance, and would be held in high admiration, not only with all\r\nmen now living but also with posterity. Nor were these the only\r\nconsiderations that gave dignity to the struggle. They would thus\r\nconquer not only the Athenians but also their numerous allies, and\r\nconquer not alone, but with their companions in arms, commanding side\r\nby side with the Corinthians and Lacedaemonians, having offered their\r\ncity to stand in the van of danger, and having been in a great measure\r\nthe pioneers of naval success.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there were never so many peoples assembled before a single\r\ncity, if we except the grand total gathered together in this war under\r\nAthens and Lacedaemon. The following were the states on either side who\r\ncame to Syracuse to fight for or against Sicily, to help to conquer or\r\ndefend the island. Right or community of blood was not the bond of\r\nunion between them, so much as interest or compulsion as the case might\r\nbe. The Athenians themselves being Ionians went against the Dorians of\r\nSyracuse of their own free will; and the peoples still speaking Attic\r\nand using the Athenian laws, the Lemnians, Imbrians, and Aeginetans,\r\nthat is to say the then occupants of Aegina, being their colonists,\r\nwent with them. To these must be also added the Hestiaeans dwelling at\r\nHestiaea in Euboea. Of the rest some joined in the expedition as\r\nsubjects of the Athenians, others as independent allies, others as\r\nmercenaries. To the number of the subjects paying tribute belonged the\r\nEretrians, Chalcidians, Styrians, and Carystians from Euboea; the\r\nCeans, Andrians, and Tenians from the islands; and the Milesians,\r\nSamians, and Chians from Ionia. The Chians, however, joined as\r\nindependent allies, paying no tribute, but furnishing ships. Most of\r\nthese were Ionians and descended from the Athenians, except the\r\nCarystians, who are Dryopes, and although subjects and obliged to\r\nserve, were still Ionians fighting against Dorians. Besides these there\r\nwere men of Aeolic race, the Methymnians, subjects who provided ships,\r\nnot tribute, and the Tenedians and Aenians who paid tribute. These\r\nAeolians fought against their Aeolian founders, the Boeotians in the\r\nSyracusan army, because they were obliged, while the Plataeans, the\r\nonly native Boeotians opposed to Boeotians, did so upon a just quarrel.\r\nOf the Rhodians and Cytherians, both Dorians, the latter, Lacedaemonian\r\ncolonists, fought in the Athenian ranks against their Lacedaemonian\r\ncountrymen with Gylippus; while the Rhodians, Argives by race, were\r\ncompelled to bear arms against the Dorian Syracusans and their own\r\ncolonists, the Geloans, serving with the Syracusans. Of the islanders\r\nround Peloponnese, the Cephallenians and Zacynthians accompanied the\r\nAthenians as independent allies, although their insular position really\r\nleft them little choice in the matter, owing to the maritime supremacy\r\nof Athens, while the Corcyraeans, who were not only Dorians but\r\nCorinthians, were openly serving against Corinthians and Syracusans,\r\nalthough colonists of the former and of the same race as the latter,\r\nunder colour of compulsion, but really out of free will through hatred\r\nof Corinth. The Messenians, as they are now called in Naupactus and\r\nfrom Pylos, then held by the Athenians, were taken with them to the\r\nwar. There were also a few Megarian exiles, whose fate it was to be now\r\nfighting against the Megarian Selinuntines.\r\n\r\nThe engagement of the rest was more of a voluntary nature. It was less\r\nthe league than hatred of the Lacedaemonians and the immediate private\r\nadvantage of each individual that persuaded the Dorian Argives to join\r\nthe Ionian Athenians in a war against Dorians; while the Mantineans and\r\nother Arcadian mercenaries, accustomed to go against the enemy pointed\r\nout to them at the moment, were led by interest to regard the Arcadians\r\nserving with the Corinthians as just as much their enemies as any\r\nothers. The Cretans and Aetolians also served for hire, and the Cretans\r\nwho had joined the Rhodians in founding Gela, thus came to consent to\r\nfight for pay against, instead of for, their colonists. There were also\r\nsome Acarnanians paid to serve, although they came chiefly for love of\r\nDemosthenes and out of goodwill to the Athenians whose allies they\r\nwere. These all lived on the Hellenic side of the Ionian Gulf. Of the\r\nItaliots, there were the Thurians and Metapontines, dragged into the\r\nquarrel by the stern necessities of a time of revolution; of the\r\nSiceliots, the Naxians and the Catanians; and of the barbarians, the\r\nEgestaeans, who called in the Athenians, most of the Sicels, and\r\noutside Sicily some Tyrrhenian enemies of Syracuse and Iapygian\r\nmercenaries.\r\n\r\nSuch were the peoples serving with the Athenians. Against these the\r\nSyracusans had the Camarinaeans their neighbours, the Geloans who live\r\nnext to them; then passing over the neutral Agrigentines, the\r\nSelinuntines settled on the farther side of the island. These inhabit\r\nthe part of Sicily looking towards Libya; the Himeraeans came from the\r\nside towards the Tyrrhenian Sea, being the only Hellenic inhabitants in\r\nthat quarter, and the only people that came from thence to the aid of\r\nthe Syracusans. Of the Hellenes in Sicily the above peoples joined in\r\nthe war, all Dorians and independent, and of the barbarians the Sicels\r\nonly, that is to say, such as did not go over to the Athenians. Of the\r\nHellenes outside Sicily there were the Lacedaemonians, who provided a\r\nSpartan to take the command, and a force of Neodamodes or Freedmen, and\r\nof Helots; the Corinthians, who alone joined with naval and land\r\nforces, with their Leucadian and Ambraciot kinsmen; some mercenaries\r\nsent by Corinth from Arcadia; some Sicyonians forced to serve, and from\r\noutside Peloponnese the Boeotians. In comparison, however, with these\r\nforeign auxiliaries, the great Siceliot cities furnished more in every\r\ndepartment—numbers of heavy infantry, ships, and horses, and an immense\r\nmultitude besides having been brought together; while in comparison,\r\nagain, one may say, with all the rest put together, more was provided\r\nby the Syracusans themselves, both from the greatness of the city and\r\nfrom the fact that they were in the greatest danger.\r\n\r\nSuch were the auxiliaries brought together on either side, all of which\r\nhad by this time joined, neither party experiencing any subsequent\r\naccession. It was no wonder, therefore, if the Syracusans and their\r\nallies thought that it would win them great glory if they could follow\r\nup their recent victory in the sea-fight by the capture of the whole\r\nAthenian armada, without letting it escape either by sea or by land.\r\nThey began at once to close up the Great Harbour by means of boats,\r\nmerchant vessels, and galleys moored broadside across its mouth, which\r\nis nearly a mile wide, and made all their other arrangements for the\r\nevent of the Athenians again venturing to fight at sea. There was, in\r\nfact, nothing little either in their plans or their ideas.\r\n\r\nThe Athenians, seeing them closing up the harbour and informed of their\r\nfurther designs, called a council of war. The generals and colonels\r\nassembled and discussed the difficulties of the situation; the point\r\nwhich pressed most being that they no longer had provisions for\r\nimmediate use (having sent on to Catana to tell them not to send any,\r\nin the belief that they were going away), and that they would not have\r\nany in future unless they could command the sea. They therefore\r\ndetermined to evacuate their upper lines, to enclose with a cross wall\r\nand garrison a small space close to the ships, only just sufficient to\r\nhold their stores and sick, and manning all the ships, seaworthy or\r\nnot, with every man that could be spared from the rest of their land\r\nforces, to fight it out at sea, and, if victorious, to go to Catana, if\r\nnot, to burn their vessels, form in close order, and retreat by land\r\nfor the nearest friendly place they could reach, Hellenic or barbarian.\r\nThis was no sooner settled than carried into effect; they descended\r\ngradually from the upper lines and manned all their vessels, compelling\r\nall to go on board who were of age to be in any way of use. They thus\r\nsucceeded in manning about one hundred and ten ships in all, on board\r\nof which they embarked a number of archers and darters taken from the\r\nAcarnanians and from the other foreigners, making all other provisions\r\nallowed by the nature of their plan and by the necessities which\r\nimposed it. All was now nearly ready, and Nicias, seeing the soldiery\r\ndisheartened by their unprecedented and decided defeat at sea, and by\r\nreason of the scarcity of provisions eager to fight it out as soon as\r\npossible, called them all together, and first addressed them, speaking\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n“Soldiers of the Athenians and of the allies, we have all an equal\r\ninterest in the coming struggle, in which life and country are at stake\r\nfor us quite as much as they can be for the enemy; since if our fleet\r\nwins the day, each can see his native city again, wherever that city\r\nmay be. You must not lose heart, or be like men without any experience,\r\nwho fail in a first essay and ever afterwards fearfully forebode a\r\nfuture as disastrous. But let the Athenians among you who have already\r\nhad experience of many wars, and the allies who have joined us in so\r\nmany expeditions, remember the surprises of war, and with the hope that\r\nfortune will not be always against us, prepare to fight again in a\r\nmanner worthy of the number which you see yourselves to be.\r\n\r\n“Now, whatever we thought would be of service against the crush of\r\nvessels in such a narrow harbour, and against the force upon the decks\r\nof the enemy, from which we suffered before, has all been considered\r\nwith the helmsmen, and, as far as our means allowed, provided. A number\r\nof archers and darters will go on board, and a multitude that we should\r\nnot have employed in an action in the open sea, where our science would\r\nbe crippled by the weight of the vessels; but in the present land-fight\r\nthat we are forced to make from shipboard all this will be useful. We\r\nhave also discovered the changes in construction that we must make to\r\nmeet theirs; and against the thickness of their cheeks, which did us\r\nthe greatest mischief, we have provided grappling-irons, which will\r\nprevent an assailant backing water after charging, if the soldiers on\r\ndeck here do their duty; since we are absolutely compelled to fight a\r\nland battle from the fleet, and it seems to be our interest neither to\r\nback water ourselves, nor to let the enemy do so, especially as the\r\nshore, except so much of it as may be held by our troops, is hostile\r\nground.\r\n\r\n“You must remember this and fight on as long as you can, and must not\r\nlet yourselves be driven ashore, but once alongside must make up your\r\nminds not to part company until you have swept the heavy infantry from\r\nthe enemy’s deck. I say this more for the heavy infantry than for the\r\nseamen, as it is more the business of the men on deck; and our land\r\nforces are even now on the whole the strongest. The sailors I advise,\r\nand at the same time implore, not to be too much daunted by their\r\nmisfortunes, now that we have our decks better armed and greater number\r\nof vessels. Bear in mind how well worth preserving is the pleasure felt\r\nby those of you who through your knowledge of our language and\r\nimitation of our manners were always considered Athenians, even though\r\nnot so in reality, and as such were honoured throughout Hellas, and had\r\nyour full share of the advantages of our empire, and more than your\r\nshare in the respect of our subjects and in protection from ill\r\ntreatment. You, therefore, with whom alone we freely share our empire,\r\nwe now justly require not to betray that empire in its extremity, and\r\nin scorn of Corinthians, whom you have often conquered, and of\r\nSiceliots, none of whom so much as presumed to stand against us when\r\nour navy was in its prime, we ask you to repel them, and to show that\r\neven in sickness and disaster your skill is more than a match for the\r\nfortune and vigour of any other.\r\n\r\n“For the Athenians among you I add once more this reflection: You left\r\nbehind you no more such ships in your docks as these, no more heavy\r\ninfantry in their flower; if you do aught but conquer, our enemies here\r\nwill immediately sail thither, and those that are left of us at Athens\r\nwill become unable to repel their home assailants, reinforced by these\r\nnew allies. Here you will fall at once into the hands of the\r\nSyracusans—I need not remind you of the intentions with which you\r\nattacked them—and your countrymen at home will fall into those of the\r\nLacedaemonians. Since the fate of both thus hangs upon this single\r\nbattle, now, if ever, stand firm, and remember, each and all, that you\r\nwho are now going on board are the army and navy of the Athenians, and\r\nall that is left of the state and the great name of Athens, in whose\r\ndefence if any man has any advantage in skill or courage, now is the\r\ntime for him to show it, and thus serve himself and save all.”\r\n\r\nAfter this address Nicias at once gave orders to man the ships.\r\nMeanwhile Gylippus and the Syracusans could perceive by the\r\npreparations which they saw going on that the Athenians meant to fight\r\nat sea. They had also notice of the grappling-irons, against which they\r\nspecially provided by stretching hides over the prows and much of the\r\nupper part of their vessels, in order that the irons when thrown might\r\nslip off without taking hold. All being now ready, the generals and\r\nGylippus addressed them in the following terms:\r\n\r\n“Syracusans and allies, the glorious character of our past achievements\r\nand the no less glorious results at issue in the coming battle are, we\r\nthink, understood by most of you, or you would never have thrown\r\nyourselves with such ardour into the struggle; and if there be any one\r\nnot as fully aware of the facts as he ought to be, we will declare them\r\nto him. The Athenians came to this country first to effect the conquest\r\nof Sicily, and after that, if successful, of Peloponnese and the rest\r\nof Hellas, possessing already the greatest empire yet known, of present\r\nor former times, among the Hellenes. Here for the first time they found\r\nin you men who faced their navy which made them masters everywhere; you\r\nhave already defeated them in the previous sea-fights, and will in all\r\nlikelihood defeat them again now. When men are once checked in what\r\nthey consider their special excellence, their whole opinion of\r\nthemselves suffers more than if they had not at first believed in their\r\nsuperiority, the unexpected shock to their pride causing them to give\r\nway more than their real strength warrants; and this is probably now\r\nthe case with the Athenians.\r\n\r\n“With us it is different. The original estimate of ourselves which gave\r\nus courage in the days of our unskilfulness has been strengthened,\r\nwhile the conviction superadded to it that we must be the best seamen\r\nof the time, if we have conquered the best, has given a double measure\r\nof hope to every man among us; and, for the most part, where there is\r\nthe greatest hope, there is also the greatest ardour for action. The\r\nmeans to combat us which they have tried to find in copying our\r\narmament are familiar to our warfare, and will be met by proper\r\nprovisions; while they will never be able to have a number of heavy\r\ninfantry on their decks, contrary to their custom, and a number of\r\ndarters (born landsmen, one may say, Acarnanians and others, embarked\r\nafloat, who will not know how to discharge their weapons when they have\r\nto keep still), without hampering their vessels and falling all into\r\nconfusion among themselves through fighting not according to their own\r\ntactics. For they will gain nothing by the number of their ships—I say\r\nthis to those of you who may be alarmed by having to fight against\r\nodds—as a quantity of ships in a confined space will only be slower in\r\nexecuting the movements required, and most exposed to injury from our\r\nmeans of offence. Indeed, if you would know the plain truth, as we are\r\ncredibly informed, the excess of their sufferings and the necessities\r\nof their present distress have made them desperate; they have no\r\nconfidence in their force, but wish to try their fortune in the only\r\nway they can, and either to force their passage and sail out, or after\r\nthis to retreat by land, it being impossible for them to be worse off\r\nthan they are.\r\n\r\n“The fortune of our greatest enemies having thus betrayed itself, and\r\ntheir disorder being what I have described, let us engage in anger,\r\nconvinced that, as between adversaries, nothing is more legitimate than\r\nto claim to sate the whole wrath of one’s soul in punishing the\r\naggressor, and nothing more sweet, as the proverb has it, than the\r\nvengeance upon an enemy, which it will now be ours to take. That\r\nenemies they are and mortal enemies you all know, since they came here\r\nto enslave our country, and if successful had in reserve for our men\r\nall that is most dreadful, and for our children and wives all that is\r\nmost dishonourable, and for the whole city the name which conveys the\r\ngreatest reproach. None should therefore relent or think it gain if\r\nthey go away without further danger to us. This they will do just the\r\nsame, even if they get the victory; while if we succeed, as we may\r\nexpect, in chastising them, and in handing down to all Sicily her\r\nancient freedom strengthened and confirmed, we shall have achieved no\r\nmean triumph. And the rarest dangers are those in which failure brings\r\nlittle loss and success the greatest advantage.”\r\n\r\nAfter the above address to the soldiers on their side, the Syracusan\r\ngenerals and Gylippus now perceived that the Athenians were manning\r\ntheir ships, and immediately proceeded to man their own also. Meanwhile\r\nNicias, appalled by the position of affairs, realizing the greatness\r\nand the nearness of the danger now that they were on the point of\r\nputting out from shore, and thinking, as men are apt to think in great\r\ncrises, that when all has been done they have still something left to\r\ndo, and when all has been said that they have not yet said enough,\r\nagain called on the captains one by one, addressing each by his\r\nfather’s name and by his own, and by that of his tribe, and adjured\r\nthem not to belie their own personal renown, or to obscure the\r\nhereditary virtues for which their ancestors were illustrious: he\r\nreminded them of their country, the freest of the free, and of the\r\nunfettered discretion allowed in it to all to live as they pleased; and\r\nadded other arguments such as men would use at such a crisis, and\r\nwhich, with little alteration, are made to serve on all occasions\r\nalike—appeals to wives, children, and national gods—without caring\r\nwhether they are thought commonplace, but loudly invoking them in the\r\nbelief that they will be of use in the consternation of the moment.\r\nHaving thus admonished them, not, he felt, as he would, but as he\r\ncould, Nicias withdrew and led the troops to the sea, and ranged them\r\nin as long a line as he was able, in order to aid as far as possible in\r\nsustaining the courage of the men afloat; while Demosthenes, Menander,\r\nand Euthydemus, who took the command on board, put out from their own\r\ncamp and sailed straight to the barrier across the mouth of the harbour\r\nand to the passage left open, to try to force their way out.\r\n\r\nThe Syracusans and their allies had already put out with about the same\r\nnumber of ships as before, a part of which kept guard at the outlet,\r\nand the remainder all round the rest of the harbour, in order to attack\r\nthe Athenians on all sides at once; while the land forces held\r\nthemselves in readiness at the points at which the vessels might put\r\ninto the shore. The Syracusan fleet was commanded by Sicanus and\r\nAgatharchus, who had each a wing of the whole force, with Pythen and\r\nthe Corinthians in the centre. When the rest of the Athenians came up\r\nto the barrier, with the first shock of their charge they overpowered\r\nthe ships stationed there, and tried to undo the fastenings; after\r\nthis, as the Syracusans and allies bore down upon them from all\r\nquarters, the action spread from the barrier over the whole harbour,\r\nand was more obstinately disputed than any of the preceding ones. On\r\neither side the rowers showed great zeal in bringing up their vessels\r\nat the boatswains’ orders, and the helmsmen great skill in manoeuvring,\r\nand great emulation one with another; while the ships once alongside,\r\nthe soldiers on board did their best not to let the service on deck be\r\noutdone by the others; in short, every man strove to prove himself the\r\nfirst in his particular department. And as many ships were engaged in a\r\nsmall compass (for these were the largest fleets fighting in the\r\nnarrowest space ever known, being together little short of two\r\nhundred), the regular attacks with the beak were few, there being no\r\nopportunity of backing water or of breaking the line; while the\r\ncollisions caused by one ship chancing to run foul of another, either\r\nin flying from or attacking a third, were more frequent. So long as a\r\nvessel was coming up to the charge the men on the decks rained darts\r\nand arrows and stones upon her; but once alongside, the heavy infantry\r\ntried to board each other’s vessel, fighting hand to hand. In many\r\nquarters it happened, by reason of the narrow room, that a vessel was\r\ncharging an enemy on one side and being charged herself on another, and\r\nthat two or sometimes more ships had perforce got entangled round one,\r\nobliging the helmsmen to attend to defence here, offence there, not to\r\none thing at once, but to many on all sides; while the huge din caused\r\nby the number of ships crashing together not only spread terror, but\r\nmade the orders of the boatswains inaudible. The boatswains on either\r\nside in the discharge of their duty and in the heat of the conflict\r\nshouted incessantly orders and appeals to their men; the Athenians they\r\nurged to force the passage out, and now if ever to show their mettle\r\nand lay hold of a safe return to their country; to the Syracusans and\r\ntheir allies they cried that it would be glorious to prevent the escape\r\nof the enemy, and, conquering, to exalt the countries that were theirs.\r\nThe generals, moreover, on either side, if they saw any in any part of\r\nthe battle backing ashore without being forced to do so, called out to\r\nthe captain by name and asked him—the Athenians, whether they were\r\nretreating because they thought the thrice hostile shore more their own\r\nthan that sea which had cost them so much labour to win; the\r\nSyracusans, whether they were flying from the flying Athenians, whom\r\nthey well knew to be eager to escape in whatever way they could.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the two armies on shore, while victory hung in the balance,\r\nwere a prey to the most agonizing and conflicting emotions; the natives\r\nthirsting for more glory than they had already won, while the invaders\r\nfeared to find themselves in even worse plight than before. The all of\r\nthe Athenians being set upon their fleet, their fear for the event was\r\nlike nothing they had ever felt; while their view of the struggle was\r\nnecessarily as chequered as the battle itself. Close to the scene of\r\naction and not all looking at the same point at once, some saw their\r\nfriends victorious and took courage and fell to calling upon heaven not\r\nto deprive them of salvation, while others who had their eyes turned\r\nupon the losers, wailed and cried aloud, and, although spectators, were\r\nmore overcome than the actual combatants. Others, again, were gazing at\r\nsome spot where the battle was evenly disputed; as the strife was\r\nprotracted without decision, their swaying bodies reflected the\r\nagitation of their minds, and they suffered the worst agony of all,\r\never just within reach of safety or just on the point of destruction.\r\nIn short, in that one Athenian army as long as the sea-fight remained\r\ndoubtful there was every sound to be heard at once, shrieks, cheers,\r\n“We win,” “We lose,” and all the other manifold exclamations that a\r\ngreat host would necessarily utter in great peril; and with the men in\r\nthe fleet it was nearly the same; until at last the Syracusans and\r\ntheir allies, after the battle had lasted a long while, put the\r\nAthenians to flight, and with much shouting and cheering chased them in\r\nopen rout to the shore. The naval force, one one way, one another, as\r\nmany as were not taken afloat now ran ashore and rushed from on board\r\ntheir ships to their camp; while the army, no more divided, but carried\r\naway by one impulse, all with shrieks and groans deplored the event,\r\nand ran down, some to help the ships, others to guard what was left of\r\ntheir wall, while the remaining and most numerous part already began to\r\nconsider how they should save themselves. Indeed, the panic of the\r\npresent moment had never been surpassed. They now suffered very nearly\r\nwhat they had inflicted at Pylos; as then the Lacedaemonians with the\r\nloss of their fleet lost also the men who had crossed over to the\r\nisland, so now the Athenians had no hope of escaping by land, without\r\nthe help of some extraordinary accident.\r\n\r\nThe sea-fight having been a severe one, and many ships and lives having\r\nbeen lost on both sides, the victorious Syracusans and their allies now\r\npicked up their wrecks and dead, and sailed off to the city and set up\r\na trophy. The Athenians, overwhelmed by their misfortune, never even\r\nthought of asking leave to take up their dead or wrecks, but wished to\r\nretreat that very night. Demosthenes, however, went to Nicias and gave\r\nit as his opinion that they should man the ships they had left and make\r\nanother effort to force their passage out next morning; saying that\r\nthey had still left more ships fit for service than the enemy, the\r\nAthenians having about sixty remaining as against less than fifty of\r\ntheir opponents. Nicias was quite of his mind; but when they wished to\r\nman the vessels, the sailors refused to go on board, being so utterly\r\novercome by their defeat as no longer to believe in the possibility of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they all now made up their minds to retreat by land.\r\nMeanwhile the Syracusan Hermocrates—suspecting their intention, and\r\nimpressed by the danger of allowing a force of that magnitude to retire\r\nby land, establish itself in some other part of Sicily, and from thence\r\nrenew the war—went and stated his views to the authorities, and pointed\r\nout to them that they ought not to let the enemy get away by night, but\r\nthat all the Syracusans and their allies should at once march out and\r\nblock up the roads and seize and guard the passes. The authorities were\r\nentirely of his opinion, and thought that it ought to be done, but on\r\nthe other hand felt sure that the people, who had given themselves over\r\nto rejoicing, and were taking their ease after a great battle at sea,\r\nwould not be easily brought to obey; besides, they were celebrating a\r\nfestival, having on that day a sacrifice to Heracles, and most of them\r\nin their rapture at the victory had fallen to drinking at the festival,\r\nand would probably consent to anything sooner than to take up their\r\narms and march out at that moment. For these reasons the thing appeared\r\nimpracticable to the magistrates; and Hermocrates, finding himself\r\nunable to do anything further with them, had now recourse to the\r\nfollowing stratagem of his own. What he feared was that the Athenians\r\nmight quietly get the start of them by passing the most difficult\r\nplaces during the night; and he therefore sent, as soon as it was dusk,\r\nsome friends of his own to the camp with some horsemen who rode up\r\nwithin earshot and called out to some of the men, as though they were\r\nwell-wishers of the Athenians, and told them to tell Nicias (who had in\r\nfact some correspondents who informed him of what went on inside the\r\ntown) not to lead off the army by night as the Syracusans were guarding\r\nthe roads, but to make his preparations at his leisure and to retreat\r\nby day. After saying this they departed; and their hearers informed the\r\nAthenian generals, who put off going for that night on the strength of\r\nthis message, not doubting its sincerity.\r\n\r\nSince after all they had not set out at once, they now determined to\r\nstay also the following day to give time to the soldiers to pack up as\r\nwell as they could the most useful articles, and, leaving everything\r\nelse behind, to start only with what was strictly necessary for their\r\npersonal subsistence. Meanwhile the Syracusans and Gylippus marched out\r\nand blocked up the roads through the country by which the Athenians\r\nwere likely to pass, and kept guard at the fords of the streams and\r\nrivers, posting themselves so as to receive them and stop the army\r\nwhere they thought best; while their fleet sailed up to the beach and\r\ntowed off the ships of the Athenians. Some few were burned by the\r\nAthenians themselves as they had intended; the rest the Syracusans\r\nlashed on to their own at their leisure as they had been thrown up on\r\nshore, without any one trying to stop them, and conveyed to the town.\r\n\r\nAfter this, Nicias and Demosthenes now thinking that enough had been\r\ndone in the way of preparation, the removal of the army took place upon\r\nthe second day after the sea-fight. It was a lamentable scene, not\r\nmerely from the single circumstance that they were retreating after\r\nhaving lost all their ships, their great hopes gone, and themselves and\r\nthe state in peril; but also in leaving the camp there were things most\r\ngrievous for every eye and heart to contemplate. The dead lay unburied,\r\nand each man as he recognized a friend among them shuddered with grief\r\nand horror; while the living whom they were leaving behind, wounded or\r\nsick, were to the living far more shocking than the dead, and more to\r\nbe pitied than those who had perished. These fell to entreating and\r\nbewailing until their friends knew not what to do, begging them to take\r\nthem and loudly calling to each individual comrade or relative whom\r\nthey could see, hanging upon the necks of their tent-fellows in the act\r\nof departure, and following as far as they could, and, when their\r\nbodily strength failed them, calling again and again upon heaven and\r\nshrieking aloud as they were left behind. So that the whole army being\r\nfilled with tears and distracted after this fashion found it not easy\r\nto go, even from an enemy’s land, where they had already suffered evils\r\ntoo great for tears and in the unknown future before them feared to\r\nsuffer more. Dejection and self-condemnation were also rife among them.\r\nIndeed they could only be compared to a starved-out town, and that no\r\nsmall one, escaping; the whole multitude upon the march being not less\r\nthan forty thousand men. All carried anything they could which might be\r\nof use, and the heavy infantry and troopers, contrary to their wont,\r\nwhile under arms carried their own victuals, in some cases for want of\r\nservants, in others through not trusting them; as they had long been\r\ndeserting and now did so in greater numbers than ever. Yet even thus\r\nthey did not carry enough, as there was no longer food in the camp.\r\nMoreover their disgrace generally, and the universality of their\r\nsufferings, however to a certain extent alleviated by being borne in\r\ncompany, were still felt at the moment a heavy burden, especially when\r\nthey contrasted the splendour and glory of their setting out with the\r\nhumiliation in which it had ended. For this was by far the greatest\r\nreverse that ever befell an Hellenic army. They had come to enslave\r\nothers, and were departing in fear of being enslaved themselves: they\r\nhad sailed out with prayer and paeans, and now started to go back with\r\nomens directly contrary; travelling by land instead of by sea, and\r\ntrusting not in their fleet but in their heavy infantry. Nevertheless\r\nthe greatness of the danger still impending made all this appear\r\ntolerable.\r\n\r\nNicias seeing the army dejected and greatly altered, passed along the\r\nranks and encouraged and comforted them as far as was possible under\r\nthe circumstances, raising his voice still higher and higher as he went\r\nfrom one company to another in his earnestness, and in his anxiety that\r\nthe benefit of his words might reach as many as possible:\r\n\r\n“Athenians and allies, even in our present position we must still hope\r\non, since men have ere now been saved from worse straits than this; and\r\nyou must not condemn yourselves too severely either because of your\r\ndisasters or because of your present unmerited sufferings. I myself who\r\nam not superior to any of you in strength—indeed you see how I am in my\r\nsickness—and who in the gifts of fortune am, I think, whether in\r\nprivate life or otherwise, the equal of any, am now exposed to the same\r\ndanger as the meanest among you; and yet my life has been one of much\r\ndevotion toward the gods, and of much justice and without offence\r\ntoward men. I have, therefore, still a strong hope for the future, and\r\nour misfortunes do not terrify me as much as they might. Indeed we may\r\nhope that they will be lightened: our enemies have had good fortune\r\nenough; and if any of the gods was offended at our expedition, we have\r\nbeen already amply punished. Others before us have attacked their\r\nneighbours and have done what men will do without suffering more than\r\nthey could bear; and we may now justly expect to find the gods more\r\nkind, for we have become fitter objects for their pity than their\r\njealousy. And then look at yourselves, mark the numbers and efficiency\r\nof the heavy infantry marching in your ranks, and do not give way too\r\nmuch to despondency, but reflect that you are yourselves at once a city\r\nwherever you sit down, and that there is no other in Sicily that could\r\neasily resist your attack, or expel you when once established. The\r\nsafety and order of the march is for yourselves to look to; the one\r\nthought of each man being that the spot on which he may be forced to\r\nfight must be conquered and held as his country and stronghold.\r\nMeanwhile we shall hasten on our way night and day alike, as our\r\nprovisions are scanty; and if we can reach some friendly place of the\r\nSicels, whom fear of the Syracusans still keeps true to us, you may\r\nforthwith consider yourselves safe. A message has been sent on to them\r\nwith directions to meet us with supplies of food. To sum up, be\r\nconvinced, soldiers, that you must be brave, as there is no place near\r\nfor your cowardice to take refuge in, and that if you now escape from\r\nthe enemy, you may all see again what your hearts desire, while those\r\nof you who are Athenians will raise up again the great power of the\r\nstate, fallen though it be. Men make the city and not walls or ships\r\nwithout men in them.”\r\n\r\nAs he made this address, Nicias went along the ranks, and brought back\r\nto their place any of the troops that he saw straggling out of the\r\nline; while Demosthenes did as much for his part of the army,\r\naddressing them in words very similar. The army marched in a hollow\r\nsquare, the division under Nicias leading, and that of Demosthenes\r\nfollowing, the heavy infantry being outside and the baggage-carriers\r\nand the bulk of the army in the middle. When they arrived at the ford\r\nof the river Anapus there they found drawn up a body of the Syracusans\r\nand allies, and routing these, made good their passage and pushed on,\r\nharassed by the charges of the Syracusan horse and by the missiles of\r\ntheir light troops. On that day they advanced about four miles and a\r\nhalf, halting for the night upon a certain hill. On the next they\r\nstarted early and got on about two miles further, and descended into a\r\nplace in the plain and there encamped, in order to procure some\r\neatables from the houses, as the place was inhabited, and to carry on\r\nwith them water from thence, as for many furlongs in front, in the\r\ndirection in which they were going, it was not plentiful. The\r\nSyracusans meanwhile went on and fortified the pass in front, where\r\nthere was a steep hill with a rocky ravine on each side of it, called\r\nthe Acraean cliff. The next day the Athenians advancing found\r\nthemselves impeded by the missiles and charges of the horse and\r\ndarters, both very numerous, of the Syracusans and allies; and after\r\nfighting for a long while, at length retired to the same camp, where\r\nthey had no longer provisions as before, it being impossible to leave\r\ntheir position by reason of the cavalry.\r\n\r\nEarly next morning they started afresh and forced their way to the\r\nhill, which had been fortified, where they found before them the\r\nenemy’s infantry drawn up many shields deep to defend the\r\nfortification, the pass being narrow. The Athenians assaulted the work,\r\nbut were greeted by a storm of missiles from the hill, which told with\r\nthe greater effect through its being a steep one, and unable to force\r\nthe passage, retreated again and rested. Meanwhile occurred some claps\r\nof thunder and rain, as often happens towards autumn, which still\r\nfurther disheartened the Athenians, who thought all these things to be\r\nomens of their approaching ruin. While they were resting, Gylippus and\r\nthe Syracusans sent a part of their army to throw up works in their\r\nrear on the way by which they had advanced; however, the Athenians\r\nimmediately sent some of their men and prevented them; after which they\r\nretreated more towards the plain and halted for the night. When they\r\nadvanced the next day the Syracusans surrounded and attacked them on\r\nevery side, and disabled many of them, falling back if the Athenians\r\nadvanced and coming on if they retired, and in particular assaulting\r\ntheir rear, in the hope of routing them in detail, and thus striking a\r\npanic into the whole army. For a long while the Athenians persevered in\r\nthis fashion, but after advancing for four or five furlongs halted to\r\nrest in the plain, the Syracusans also withdrawing to their own camp.\r\n\r\nDuring the night Nicias and Demosthenes, seeing the wretched condition\r\nof their troops, now in want of every kind of necessary, and numbers of\r\nthem disabled in the numerous attacks of the enemy, determined to light\r\nas many fires as possible, and to lead off the army, no longer by the\r\nsame route as they had intended, but towards the sea in the opposite\r\ndirection to that guarded by the Syracusans. The whole of this route\r\nwas leading the army not to Catana but to the other side of Sicily,\r\ntowards Camarina, Gela, and the other Hellenic and barbarian towns in\r\nthat quarter. They accordingly lit a number of fires and set out by\r\nnight. Now all armies, and the greatest most of all, are liable to\r\nfears and alarms, especially when they are marching by night through an\r\nenemy’s country and with the enemy near; and the Athenians falling into\r\none of these panics, the leading division, that of Nicias, kept\r\ntogether and got on a good way in front, while that of Demosthenes,\r\ncomprising rather more than half the army, got separated and marched on\r\nin some disorder. By morning, however, they reached the sea, and\r\ngetting into the Helorine road, pushed on in order to reach the river\r\nCacyparis, and to follow the stream up through the interior, where they\r\nhoped to be met by the Sicels whom they had sent for. Arrived at the\r\nriver, they found there also a Syracusan party engaged in barring the\r\npassage of the ford with a wall and a palisade, and forcing this guard,\r\ncrossed the river and went on to another called the Erineus, according\r\nto the advice of their guides.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, when day came and the Syracusans and allies found that the\r\nAthenians were gone, most of them accused Gylippus of having let them\r\nescape on purpose, and hastily pursuing by the road which they had no\r\ndifficulty in finding that they had taken, overtook them about\r\ndinner-time. They first came up with the troops under Demosthenes, who\r\nwere behind and marching somewhat slowly and in disorder, owing to the\r\nnight panic above referred to, and at once attacked and engaged them,\r\nthe Syracusan horse surrounding them with more ease now that they were\r\nseparated from the rest and hemming them in on one spot. The division\r\nof Nicias was five or six miles on in front, as he led them more\r\nrapidly, thinking that under the circumstances their safety lay not in\r\nstaying and fighting, unless obliged, but in retreating as fast as\r\npossible, and only fighting when forced to do so. On the other hand,\r\nDemosthenes was, generally speaking, harassed more incessantly, as his\r\npost in the rear left him the first exposed to the attacks of the\r\nenemy; and now, finding that the Syracusans were in pursuit, he omitted\r\nto push on, in order to form his men for battle, and so lingered until\r\nhe was surrounded by his pursuers and himself and the Athenians with\r\nhim placed in the most distressing position, being huddled into an\r\nenclosure with a wall all round it, a road on this side and on that,\r\nand olive-trees in great number, where missiles were showered in upon\r\nthem from every quarter. This mode of attack the Syracusans had with\r\ngood reason adopted in preference to fighting at close quarters, as to\r\nrisk a struggle with desperate men was now more for the advantage of\r\nthe Athenians than for their own; besides, their success had now become\r\nso certain that they began to spare themselves a little in order not to\r\nbe cut off in the moment of victory, thinking too that, as it was, they\r\nwould be able in this way to subdue and capture the enemy.\r\n\r\nIn fact, after plying the Athenians and allies all day long from every\r\nside with missiles, they at length saw that they were worn out with\r\ntheir wounds and other sufferings; and Gylippus and the Syracusans and\r\ntheir allies made a proclamation, offering their liberty to any of the\r\nislanders who chose to come over to them; and some few cities went\r\nover. Afterwards a capitulation was agreed upon for all the rest with\r\nDemosthenes, to lay down their arms on condition that no one was to be\r\nput to death either by violence or imprisonment or want of the\r\nnecessaries of life. Upon this they surrendered to the number of six\r\nthousand in all, laying down all the money in their possession, which\r\nfilled the hollows of four shields, and were immediately conveyed by\r\nthe Syracusans to the town.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Nicias with his division arrived that day at the river\r\nErineus, crossed over, and posted his army upon some high ground upon\r\nthe other side. The next day the Syracusans overtook him and told him\r\nthat the troops under Demosthenes had surrendered, and invited him to\r\nfollow their example. Incredulous of the fact, Nicias asked for a truce\r\nto send a horseman to see, and upon the return of the messenger with\r\nthe tidings that they had surrendered, sent a herald to Gylippus and\r\nthe Syracusans, saying that he was ready to agree with them on behalf\r\nof the Athenians to repay whatever money the Syracusans had spent upon\r\nthe war if they would let his army go; and offered until the money was\r\npaid to give Athenians as hostages, one for every talent. The\r\nSyracusans and Gylippus rejected this proposition, and attacked this\r\ndivision as they had the other, standing all round and plying them with\r\nmissiles until the evening. Food and necessaries were as miserably\r\nwanting to the troops of Nicias as they had been to their comrades;\r\nnevertheless they watched for the quiet of the night to resume their\r\nmarch. But as they were taking up their arms the Syracusans perceived\r\nit and raised their paean, upon which the Athenians, finding that they\r\nwere discovered, laid them down again, except about three hundred men\r\nwho forced their way through the guards and went on during the night as\r\nthey were able.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was day Nicias put his army in motion, pressed, as\r\nbefore, by the Syracusans and their allies, pelted from every side by\r\ntheir missiles, and struck down by their javelins. The Athenians pushed\r\non for the Assinarus, impelled by the attacks made upon them from every\r\nside by a numerous cavalry and the swarm of other arms, fancying that\r\nthey should breathe more freely if once across the river, and driven on\r\nalso by their exhaustion and craving for water. Once there they rushed\r\nin, and all order was at an end, each man wanting to cross first, and\r\nthe attacks of the enemy making it difficult to cross at all; forced to\r\nhuddle together, they fell against and trod down one another, some\r\ndying immediately upon the javelins, others getting entangled together\r\nand stumbling over the articles of baggage, without being able to rise\r\nagain. Meanwhile the opposite bank, which was steep, was lined by the\r\nSyracusans, who showered missiles down upon the Athenians, most of them\r\ndrinking greedily and heaped together in disorder in the hollow bed of\r\nthe river. The Peloponnesians also came down and butchered them,\r\nespecially those in the water, which was thus immediately spoiled, but\r\nwhich they went on drinking just the same, mud and all, bloody as it\r\nwas, most even fighting to have it.\r\n\r\nAt last, when many dead now lay piled one upon another in the stream,\r\nand part of the army had been destroyed at the river, and the few that\r\nescaped from thence cut off by the cavalry, Nicias surrendered himself\r\nto Gylippus, whom he trusted more than he did the Syracusans, and told\r\nhim and the Lacedaemonians to do what they liked with him, but to stop\r\nthe slaughter of the soldiers. Gylippus, after this, immediately gave\r\norders to make prisoners; upon which the rest were brought together\r\nalive, except a large number secreted by the soldiery, and a party was\r\nsent in pursuit of the three hundred who had got through the guard\r\nduring the night, and who were now taken with the rest. The number of\r\nthe enemy collected as public property was not considerable; but that\r\nsecreted was very large, and all Sicily was filled with them, no\r\nconvention having been made in their case as for those taken with\r\nDemosthenes. Besides this, a large portion were killed outright, the\r\ncarnage being very great, and not exceeded by any in this Sicilian war.\r\nIn the numerous other encounters upon the march, not a few also had\r\nfallen. Nevertheless many escaped, some at the moment, others served as\r\nslaves, and then ran away subsequently. These found refuge at Catana.\r\n\r\nThe Syracusans and their allies now mustered and took up the spoils and\r\nas many prisoners as they could, and went back to the city. The rest of\r\ntheir Athenian and allied captives were deposited in the quarries, this\r\nseeming the safest way of keeping them; but Nicias and Demosthenes were\r\nbutchered, against the will of Gylippus, who thought that it would be\r\nthe crown of his triumph if he could take the enemy’s generals to\r\nLacedaemon. One of them, as it happened, Demosthenes, was one of her\r\ngreatest enemies, on account of the affair of the island and of Pylos;\r\nwhile the other, Nicias, was for the same reasons one of her greatest\r\nfriends, owing to his exertions to procure the release of the prisoners\r\nby persuading the Athenians to make peace. For these reasons the\r\nLacedaemonians felt kindly towards him; and it was in this that Nicias\r\nhimself mainly confided when he surrendered to Gylippus. But some of\r\nthe Syracusans who had been in correspondence with him were afraid, it\r\nwas said, of his being put to the torture and troubling their success\r\nby his revelations; others, especially the Corinthians, of his\r\nescaping, as he was wealthy, by means of bribes, and living to do them\r\nfurther mischief; and these persuaded the allies and put him to death.\r\nThis or the like was the cause of the death of a man who, of all the\r\nHellenes in my time, least deserved such a fate, seeing that the whole\r\ncourse of his life had been regulated with strict attention to virtue.\r\n\r\nThe prisoners in the quarries were at first hardly treated by the\r\nSyracusans. Crowded in a narrow hole, without any roof to cover them,\r\nthe heat of the sun and the stifling closeness of the air tormented\r\nthem during the day, and then the nights, which came on autumnal and\r\nchilly, made them ill by the violence of the change; besides, as they\r\nhad to do everything in the same place for want of room, and the bodies\r\nof those who died of their wounds or from the variation in the\r\ntemperature, or from similar causes, were left heaped together one upon\r\nanother, intolerable stenches arose; while hunger and thirst never\r\nceased to afflict them, each man during eight months having only half a\r\npint of water and a pint of corn given him daily. In short, no single\r\nsuffering to be apprehended by men thrust into such a place was spared\r\nthem. For some seventy days they thus lived all together, after which\r\nall, except the Athenians and any Siceliots or Italiots who had joined\r\nin the expedition, were sold. The total number of prisoners taken it\r\nwould be difficult to state exactly, but it could not have been less\r\nthan seven thousand.\r\n\r\nThis was the greatest Hellenic achievement of any in thig war, or, in\r\nmy opinion, in Hellenic history; at once most glorious to the victors,\r\nand most calamitous to the conquered. They were beaten at all points\r\nand altogether; all that they suffered was great; they were destroyed,\r\nas the saying is, with a total destruction, their fleet, their army,\r\neverything was destroyed, and few out of many returned home. Such were\r\nthe events in Sicily.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBOOK VIII\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV\r\n\r\n\r\nNineteenth and Twentieth Years of the War—Revolt of Ionia— Intervention\r\nof Persia—The War in Ionia\r\n\r\n\r\nWhen the news was brought to Athens, for a long while they disbelieved\r\neven the most respectable of the soldiers who had themselves escaped\r\nfrom the scene of action and clearly reported the matter, a destruction\r\nso complete not being thought credible. When the conviction was forced\r\nupon them, they were angry with the orators who had joined in promoting\r\nthe expedition, just as if they had not themselves voted it, and were\r\nenraged also with the reciters of oracles and soothsayers, and all\r\nother omen-mongers of the time who had encouraged them to hope that\r\nthey should conquer Sicily. Already distressed at all points and in all\r\nquarters, after what had now happened, they were seized by a fear and\r\nconsternation quite without example. It was grievous enough for the\r\nstate and for every man in his proper person to lose so many heavy\r\ninfantry, cavalry, and able-bodied troops, and to see none left to\r\nreplace them; but when they saw, also, that they had not sufficient\r\nships in their docks, or money in the treasury, or crews for the ships,\r\nthey began to despair of salvation. They thought that their enemies in\r\nSicily would immediately sail with their fleet against Piraeus,\r\ninflamed by so signal a victory; while their adversaries at home,\r\nredoubling all their preparations, would vigorously attack them by sea\r\nand land at once, aided by their own revolted confederates.\r\nNevertheless, with such means as they had, it was determined to resist\r\nto the last, and to provide timber and money, and to equip a fleet as\r\nthey best could, to take steps to secure their confederates and above\r\nall Euboea, to reform things in the city upon a more economical\r\nfooting, and to elect a board of elders to advise upon the state of\r\naffairs as occasion should arise. In short, as is the way of a\r\ndemocracy, in the panic of the moment they were ready to be as prudent\r\nas possible.\r\n\r\nThese resolves were at once carried into effect. Summer was now over.\r\nThe winter ensuing saw all Hellas stirring under the impression of the\r\ngreat Athenian disaster in Sicily. Neutrals now felt that even if\r\nuninvited they ought no longer to stand aloof from the war, but should\r\nvolunteer to march against the Athenians, who, as they severally\r\nreflected, would probably have come against them if the Sicilian\r\ncampaign had succeeded. Besides, they considered that the war would now\r\nbe short, and that it would be creditable for them to take part in it.\r\nMeanwhile the allies of the Lacedaemonians felt all more anxious than\r\never to see a speedy end to their heavy labours. But above all, the\r\nsubjects of the Athenians showed a readiness to revolt even beyond\r\ntheir ability, judging the circumstances with passion, and refusing\r\neven to hear of the Athenians being able to last out the coming summer.\r\nBeyond all this, Lacedaemon was encouraged by the near prospect of\r\nbeing joined in great force in the spring by her allies in Sicily,\r\nlately forced by events to acquire their navy. With these reasons for\r\nconfidence in every quarter, the Lacedaemonians now resolved to throw\r\nthemselves without reserve into the war, considering that, once it was\r\nhappily terminated, they would be finally delivered from such dangers\r\nas that which would have threatened them from Athens, if she had become\r\nmistress of Sicily, and that the overthrow of the Athenians would leave\r\nthem in quiet enjoyment of the supremacy over all Hellas.\r\n\r\nTheir king, Agis, accordingly set out at once during this winter with\r\nsome troops from Decelea, and levied from the allies contributions for\r\nthe fleet, and turning towards the Malian Gulf exacted a sum of money\r\nfrom the Oetaeans by carrying off most of their cattle in reprisal for\r\ntheir old hostility, and, in spite of the protests and opposition of\r\nthe Thessalians, forced the Achaeans of Phthiotis and the other\r\nsubjects of the Thessalians in those parts to give him money and\r\nhostages, and deposited the hostages at Corinth, and tried to bring\r\ntheir countrymen into the confederacy. The Lacedaemonians now issued a\r\nrequisition to the cities for building a hundred ships, fixing their\r\nown quota and that of the Boeotians at twenty-five each; that of the\r\nPhocians and Locrians together at fifteen; that of the Corinthians at\r\nfifteen; that of the Arcadians, Pellenians, and Sicyonians together at\r\nten; and that of the Megarians, Troezenians, Epidaurians, and\r\nHermionians together at ten also; and meanwhile made every other\r\npreparation for commencing hostilities by the spring.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Athenians were not idle. During this same winter,\r\nas they had determined, they contributed timber and pushed on their\r\nship-building, and fortified Sunium to enable their corn-ships to round\r\nit in safety, and evacuated the fort in Laconia which they had built on\r\ntheir way to Sicily; while they also, for economy, cut down any other\r\nexpenses that seemed unnecessary, and above all kept a careful look-out\r\nagainst the revolt of their confederates.\r\n\r\nWhile both parties were thus engaged, and were as intent upon preparing\r\nfor the war as they had been at the outset, the Euboeans first of all\r\nsent envoys during this winter to Agis to treat of their revolting from\r\nAthens. Agis accepted their proposals, and sent for Alcamenes, son of\r\nSthenelaidas, and Melanthus from Lacedaemon, to take the command in\r\nEuboea. These accordingly arrived with some three hundred Neodamodes,\r\nand Agis began to arrange for their crossing over. But in the meanwhile\r\narrived some Lesbians, who also wished to revolt; and these being\r\nsupported by the Boeotians, Agis was persuaded to defer acting in the\r\nmatter of Euboea, and made arrangements for the revolt of the Lesbians,\r\ngiving them Alcamenes, who was to have sailed to Euboea, as governor,\r\nand himself promising them ten ships, and the Boeotians the same\r\nnumber. All this was done without instructions from home, as Agis while\r\nat Decelea with the army that he commanded had power to send troops to\r\nwhatever quarter he pleased, and to levy men and money. During this\r\nperiod, one might say, the allies obeyed him much more than they did\r\nthe Lacedaemonians in the city, as the force he had with him made him\r\nfeared at once wherever he went. While Agis was engaged with the\r\nLesbians, the Chians and Erythraeans, who were also ready to revolt,\r\napplied, not to him but at Lacedaemon; where they arrived accompanied\r\nby an ambassador from Tissaphernes, the commander of King Darius, son\r\nof Artaxerxes, in the maritime districts, who invited the\r\nPeloponnesians to come over, and promised to maintain their army. The\r\nKing had lately called upon him for the tribute from his government,\r\nfor which he was in arrears, being unable to raise it from the Hellenic\r\ntowns by reason of the Athenians; and he therefore calculated that by\r\nweakening the Athenians he should get the tribute better paid, and\r\nshould also draw the Lacedaemonians into alliance with the King; and by\r\nthis means, as the King had commanded him, take alive or dead Amorges,\r\nthe bastard son of Pissuthnes, who was in rebellion on the coast of\r\nCaria.\r\n\r\nWhile the Chians and Tissaphernes thus joined to effect the same\r\nobject, about the same time Calligeitus, son of Laophon, a Megarian,\r\nand Timagoras, son of Athenagoras, a Cyzicene, both of them exiles from\r\ntheir country and living at the court of Pharnabazus, son of Pharnaces,\r\narrived at Lacedaemon upon a mission from Pharnabazus, to procure a\r\nfleet for the Hellespont; by means of which, if possible, he might\r\nhimself effect the object of Tissaphernes’ ambition and cause the\r\ncities in his government to revolt from the Athenians, and so get the\r\ntribute, and by his own agency obtain for the King the alliance of the\r\nLacedaemonians.\r\n\r\nThe emissaries of Pharnabazus and Tissaphernes treating apart, a keen\r\ncompetition now ensued at Lacedaemon as to whether a fleet and army\r\nshould be sent first to Ionia and Chios, or to the Hellespont. The\r\nLacedaemonians, however, decidedly favoured the Chians and\r\nTissaphernes, who were seconded by Alcibiades, the family friend of\r\nEndius, one of the ephors for that year. Indeed, this is how their\r\nhouse got its Laconic name, Alcibiades being the family name of Endius.\r\nNevertheless the Lacedaemonians first sent to Chios Phrynis, one of the\r\nPerioeci, to see whether they had as many ships as they said, and\r\nwhether their city generally was as great as was reported; and upon his\r\nbringing word that they had been told the truth, immediately entered\r\ninto alliance with the Chians and Erythraeans, and voted to send them\r\nforty ships, there being already, according to the statement of the\r\nChians, not less than sixty in the island. At first the Lacedaemonians\r\nmeant to send ten of these forty themselves, with Melanchridas their\r\nadmiral; but afterwards, an earthquake having occurred, they sent\r\nChalcideus instead of Melanchridas, and instead of the ten ships\r\nequipped only five in Laconia. And the winter ended, and with it ended\r\nalso the nineteenth year of this war of which Thucydides is the\r\nhistorian.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the next summer the Chians were urging that the\r\nfleet should be sent off, being afraid that the Athenians, from whom\r\nall these embassies were kept a secret, might find out what was going\r\non, and the Lacedaemonians at once sent three Spartans to Corinth to\r\nhaul the ships as quickly as possible across the Isthmus from the other\r\nsea to that on the side of Athens, and to order them all to sail to\r\nChios, those which Agis was equipping for Lesbos not excepted. The\r\nnumber of ships from the allied states was thirty-nine in all.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Calligeitus and Timagoras did not join on behalf of\r\nPharnabazus in the expedition to Chios or give the money—twenty-five\r\ntalents—which they had brought with them to help in dispatching a\r\nforce, but determined to sail afterwards with another force by\r\nthemselves. Agis, on the other hand, seeing the Lacedaemonians bent\r\nupon going to Chios first, himself came in to their views; and the\r\nallies assembled at Corinth and held a council, in which they decided\r\nto sail first to Chios under the command of Chalcideus, who was\r\nequipping the five vessels in Laconia, then to Lesbos, under the\r\ncommand of Alcamenes, the same whom Agis had fixed upon, and lastly to\r\ngo to the Hellespont, where the command was given to Clearchus, son of\r\nRamphias. Meanwhile they would take only half the ships across the\r\nIsthmus first, and let those sail off at once, in order that the\r\nAthenians might attend less to the departing squadron than to those to\r\nbe taken across afterwards, as no care had been taken to keep this\r\nvoyage secret through contempt of the impotence of the Athenians, who\r\nhad as yet no fleet of any account upon the sea. Agreeably to this\r\ndetermination, twenty-one vessels were at once conveyed across the\r\nIsthmus.\r\n\r\nThey were now impatient to set sail, but the Corinthians were not\r\nwilling to accompany them until they had celebrated the Isthmian\r\nfestival, which fell at that time. Upon this Agis proposed to them to\r\nsave their scruples about breaking the Isthmian truce by taking the\r\nexpedition upon himself. The Corinthians not consenting to this, a\r\ndelay ensued, during which the Athenians conceived suspicions of what\r\nwas preparing at Chios, and sent Aristocrates, one of their generals,\r\nand charged them with the fact, and, upon the denial of the Chians,\r\nordered them to send with them a contingent of ships, as faithful\r\nconfederates. Seven were sent accordingly. The reason of the dispatch\r\nof the ships lay in the fact that the mass of the Chians were not privy\r\nto the negotiations, while the few who were in the secret did not wish\r\nto break with the multitude until they had something positive to lean\r\nupon, and no longer expected the Peloponnesians to arrive by reason of\r\ntheir delay.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Isthmian games took place, and the Athenians, who\r\nhad been also invited, went to attend them, and now seeing more clearly\r\ninto the designs of the Chians, as soon as they returned to Athens took\r\nmeasures to prevent the fleet putting out from Cenchreae without their\r\nknowledge. After the festival the Peloponnesians set sail with\r\ntwenty-one ships for Chios, under the command of Alcamenes. The\r\nAthenians first sailed against them with an equal number, drawing off\r\ntowards the open sea. The enemy, however, turning back before he had\r\nfollowed them far, the Athenians returned also, not trusting the seven\r\nChian ships which formed part of their number, and afterwards manned\r\nthirty-seven vessels in all and chased him on his passage alongshore\r\ninto Spiraeum, a desert Corinthian port on the edge of the Epidaurian\r\nfrontier. After losing one ship out at sea, the Peloponnesians got the\r\nrest together and brought them to anchor. The Athenians now attacked\r\nnot only from the sea with their fleet, but also disembarked upon the\r\ncoast; and a melee ensued of the most confused and violent kind, in\r\nwhich the Athenians disabled most of the enemy’s vessels and killed\r\nAlcamenes their commander, losing also a few of their own men.\r\n\r\nAfter this they separated, and the Athenians, detaching a sufficient\r\nnumber of ships to blockade those of the enemy, anchored with the rest\r\nat the islet adjacent, upon which they proceeded to encamp, and sent to\r\nAthens for reinforcements; the Peloponnesians having been joined on the\r\nday after the battle by the Corinthians, who came to help the ships,\r\nand by the other inhabitants in the vicinity not long afterwards. These\r\nsaw the difficulty of keeping guard in a desert place, and in their\r\nperplexity at first thought of burning the ships, but finally resolved\r\nto haul them up on shore and sit down and guard them with their land\r\nforces until a convenient opportunity for escaping should present\r\nitself. Agis also, on being informed of the disaster, sent them a\r\nSpartan of the name of Thermon. The Lacedaemonians first received the\r\nnews of the fleet having put out from the Isthmus, Alcamenes having\r\nbeen ordered by the ephors to send off a horseman when this took place,\r\nand immediately resolved to dispatch their own five vessels under\r\nChalcideus, and Alcibiades with him. But while they were full of this\r\nresolution came the second news of the fleet having taken refuge in\r\nSpiraeum; and disheartened at their first step in the Ionian war\r\nproving a failure, they laid aside the idea of sending the ships from\r\ntheir own country, and even wished to recall some that had already\r\nsailed.\r\n\r\nPerceiving this, Alcibiades again persuaded Endius and the other ephors\r\nto persevere in the expedition, saying that the voyage would be made\r\nbefore the Chians heard of the fleet’s misfortune, and that as soon as\r\nhe set foot in Ionia, he should, by assuring them of the weakness of\r\nthe Athenians and the zeal of Lacedaemon, have no difficulty in\r\npersuading the cities to revolt, as they would readily believe his\r\ntestimony. He also represented to Endius himself in private that it\r\nwould be glorious for him to be the means of making Ionia revolt and\r\nthe King become the ally of Lacedaemon, instead of that honour being\r\nleft to Agis (Agis, it must be remembered, was the enemy of\r\nAlcibiades); and Endius and his colleagues thus persuaded, he put to\r\nsea with the five ships and the Lacedaemonian Chalcideus, and made all\r\nhaste upon the voyage.\r\n\r\nAbout this time the sixteen Peloponnesian ships from Sicily, which had\r\nserved through the war with Gylippus, were caught on their return off\r\nLeucadia and roughly handled by the twenty-seven Athenian vessels under\r\nHippocles, son of Menippus, on the lookout for the ships from Sicily.\r\nAfter losing one of their number, the rest escaped from the Athenians\r\nand sailed into Corinth.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Chalcideus and Alcibiades seized all they met with on their\r\nvoyage, to prevent news of their coming, and let them go at Corycus,\r\nthe first point which they touched at in the continent. Here they were\r\nvisited by some of their Chian correspondents and, being urged by them\r\nto sail up to the town without announcing their coming, arrived\r\nsuddenly before Chios. The many were amazed and confounded, while the\r\nfew had so arranged that the council should be sitting at the time; and\r\nafter speeches from Chalcideus and Alcibiades stating that many more\r\nships were sailing up, but saying nothing of the fleet being blockaded\r\nin Spiraeum, the Chians revolted from the Athenians, and the\r\nErythraeans immediately afterwards. After this three vessels sailed\r\nover to Clazomenae, and made that city revolt also; and the\r\nClazomenians immediately crossed over to the mainland and began to\r\nfortify Polichna, in order to retreat there, in case of necessity, from\r\nthe island where they dwelt.\r\n\r\nWhile the revolted places were all engaged in fortifying and preparing\r\nfor the war, news of Chios speedily reached Athens. The Athenians\r\nthought the danger by which they were now menaced great and\r\nunmistakable, and that the rest of their allies would not consent to\r\nkeep quiet after the secession of the greatest of their number. In the\r\nconsternation of the moment they at once took off the penalty attaching\r\nto whoever proposed or put to the vote a proposal for using the\r\nthousand talents which they had jealously avoided touching throughout\r\nthe whole war, and voted to employ them to man a large number of ships,\r\nand to send off at once under Strombichides, son of Diotimus, the eight\r\nvessels, forming part of the blockading fleet at Spiraeum, which had\r\nleft the blockade and had returned after pursuing and failing to\r\novertake the vessels with Chalcideus. These were to be followed shortly\r\nafterwards by twelve more under Thrasycles, also taken from the\r\nblockade. They also recalled the seven Chian vessels, forming part of\r\ntheir squadron blockading the fleet in Spiraeum, and giving the slaves\r\non board their liberty, put the freemen in confinement, and speedily\r\nmanned and sent out ten fresh ships to blockade the Peloponnesians in\r\nthe place of all those that had departed, and decided to man thirty\r\nmore. Zeal was not wanting, and no effort was spared to send relief to\r\nChios.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Strombichides with his eight ships arrived at Samos,\r\nand, taking one Samian vessel, sailed to Teos and required them to\r\nremain quiet. Chalcideus also set sail with twenty-three ships for Teos\r\nfrom Chios, the land forces of the Clazomenians and Erythraeans moving\r\nalongshore to support him. Informed of this in time, Strombichides put\r\nout from Teos before their arrival, and while out at sea, seeing the\r\nnumber of the ships from Chios, fled towards Samos, chased by the\r\nenemy. The Teians at first would not receive the land forces, but upon\r\nthe flight of the Athenians took them into the town. There they waited\r\nfor some time for Chalcideus to return from the pursuit, and as time\r\nwent on without his appearing, began themselves to demolish the wall\r\nwhich the Athenians had built on the land side of the city of the\r\nTeians, being assisted by a few of the barbarians who had come up under\r\nthe command of Stages, the lieutenant of Tissaphernes.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Chalcideus and Alcibiades, after chasing Strombichides into\r\nSamos, armed the crews of the ships from Peloponnese and left them at\r\nChios, and filling their places with substitutes from Chios and manning\r\ntwenty others, sailed off to effect the revolt of Miletus. The wish of\r\nAlcibiades, who had friends among the leading men of the Milesians, was\r\nto bring over the town before the arrival of the ships from\r\nPeloponnese, and thus, by causing the revolt of as many cities as\r\npossible with the help of the Chian power and of Chalcideus, to secure\r\nthe honour for the Chians and himself and Chalcideus, and, as he had\r\npromised, for Endius who had sent them out. Not discovered until their\r\nvoyage was nearly completed, they arrived a little before Strombichides\r\nand Thrasycles (who had just come with twelve ships from Athens, and\r\nhad joined Strombichides in pursuing them), and occasioned the revolt\r\nof Miletus. The Athenians sailing up close on their heels with nineteen\r\nships found Miletus closed against them, and took up their station at\r\nthe adjacent island of Lade. The first alliance between the King and\r\nthe Lacedaemonians was now concluded immediately upon the revolt of the\r\nMilesians, by Tissaphernes and Chalcideus, and was as follows:\r\n\r\nThe Lacedaemonians and their allies made a treaty with the King and\r\nTissaphernes upon the terms following:\r\n\r\n1. Whatever country or cities the King has, or the King’s ancestors\r\nhad, shall be the king’s: and whatever came in to the Athenians from\r\nthese cities, either money or any other thing, the King and the\r\nLacedaemonians and their allies shall jointly hinder the Athenians from\r\nreceiving either money or any other thing.\r\n\r\n2. The war with the Athenians shall be carried on jointly by the King\r\nand by the Lacedaemonians and their allies: and it shall not be lawful\r\nto make peace with the Athenians except both agree, the King on his\r\nside and the Lacedaemonians and their allies on theirs.\r\n\r\n3. If any revolt from the King, they shall be the enemies of the\r\nLacedaemonians and their allies. And if any revolt from the\r\nLacedaemonians and their allies, they shall be the enemies of the King\r\nin like manner.\r\n\r\nThis was the alliance. After this the Chians immediately manned ten\r\nmore vessels and sailed for Anaia, in order to gain intelligence of\r\nthose in Miletus, and also to make the cities revolt. A message,\r\nhowever, reaching them from Chalcideus to tell them to go back again,\r\nand that Amorges was at hand with an army by land, they sailed to the\r\ntemple of Zeus, and there sighting ten more ships sailing up with which\r\nDiomedon had started from Athens after Thrasycles, fled, one ship to\r\nEphesus, the rest to Teos. The Athenians took four of their ships\r\nempty, the men finding time to escape ashore; the rest took refuge in\r\nthe city of the Teians; after which the Athenians sailed off to Samos,\r\nwhile the Chians put to sea with their remaining vessels, accompanied\r\nby the land forces, and caused Lebedos to revolt, and after it Erae.\r\nAfter this they both returned home, the fleet and the army.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time the twenty ships of the Peloponnesians in Spiraeum,\r\nwhich we left chased to land and blockaded by an equal number of\r\nAthenians, suddenly sallied out and defeated the blockading squadron,\r\ntook four of their ships, and, sailing back to Cenchreae, prepared\r\nagain for the voyage to Chios and Ionia. Here they were joined by\r\nAstyochus as high admiral from Lacedaemon, henceforth invested with the\r\nsupreme command at sea. The land forces now withdrawing from Teos,\r\nTissaphernes repaired thither in person with an army and completed the\r\ndemolition of anything that was left of the wall, and so departed. Not\r\nlong after his departure Diomedon arrived with ten Athenian ships, and,\r\nhaving made a convention by which the Teians admitted him as they had\r\nthe enemy, coasted along to Erae, and, failing in an attempt upon the\r\ntown, sailed back again.\r\n\r\nAbout this time took place the rising of the commons at Samos against\r\nthe upper classes, in concert with some Athenians, who were there in\r\nthree vessels. The Samian commons put to death some two hundred in all\r\nof the upper classes, and banished four hundred more, and themselves\r\ntook their land and houses; after which the Athenians decreed their\r\nindependence, being now sure of their fidelity, and the commons\r\nhenceforth governed the city, excluding the landholders from all share\r\nin affairs, and forbidding any of the commons to give his daughter in\r\nmarriage to them or to take a wife from them in future.\r\n\r\nAfter this, during the same summer, the Chians, whose zeal continued as\r\nactive as ever, and who even without the Peloponnesians found\r\nthemselves in sufficient force to effect the revolt of the cities and\r\nalso wished to have as many companions in peril as possible, made an\r\nexpedition with thirteen ships of their own to Lesbos; the instructions\r\nfrom Lacedaemon being to go to that island next, and from thence to the\r\nHellespont. Meanwhile the land forces of the Peloponnesians who were\r\nwith the Chians and of the allies on the spot, moved alongshore for\r\nClazomenae and Cuma, under the command of Eualas, a Spartan; while the\r\nfleet under Diniadas, one of the Perioeci, first sailed up to Methymna\r\nand caused it to revolt, and, leaving four ships there, with the rest\r\nprocured the revolt of Mitylene.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Astyochus, the Lacedaemonian admiral, set sail from\r\nCenchreae with four ships, as he had intended, and arrived at Chios. On\r\nthe third day after his arrival, the Athenian ships, twenty-five in\r\nnumber, sailed to Lesbos under Diomedon and Leon, who had lately\r\narrived with a reinforcement of ten ships from Athens. Late in the same\r\nday Astyochus put to sea, and taking one Chian vessel with him sailed\r\nto Lesbos to render what assistance he could. Arrived at Pyrrha, and\r\nfrom thence the next day at Eresus, he there learned that Mitylene had\r\nbeen taken, almost without a blow, by the Athenians, who had sailed up\r\nand unexpectedly put into the harbour, had beaten the Chian ships, and\r\nlanding and defeating the troops opposed to them had become masters of\r\nthe city. Informed of this by the Eresians and the Chian ships, which\r\nhad been left with Eubulus at Methymna, and had fled upon the capture\r\nof Mitylene, and three of which he now fell in with, one having been\r\ntaken by the Athenians, Astyochus did not go on to Mitylene, but raised\r\nand armed Eresus, and, sending the heavy infantry from his own ships by\r\nland under Eteonicus to Antissa and Methymna, himself proceeded\r\nalongshore thither with the ships which he had with him and with the\r\nthree Chians, in the hope that the Methymnians upon seeing them would\r\nbe encouraged to persevere in their revolt. As, however, everything\r\nwent against him in Lesbos, he took up his own force and sailed back to\r\nChios; the land forces on board, which were to have gone to the\r\nHellespont, being also conveyed back to their different cities. After\r\nthis six of the allied Peloponnesian ships at Cenchreae joined the\r\nforces at Chios. The Athenians, after restoring matters to their old\r\nstate in Lesbos, set sail from thence and took Polichna, the place that\r\nthe Clazomenians were fortifying on the continent, and carried the\r\ninhabitants back to their town upon the island, except the authors of\r\nthe revolt, who withdrew to Daphnus; and thus Clazomenae became once\r\nmore Athenian.\r\n\r\nThe same summer the Athenians in the twenty ships at Lade, blockading\r\nMiletus, made a descent at Panormus in the Milesian territory, and\r\nkilled Chalcideus the Lacedaemonian commander, who had come with a few\r\nmen against them, and the third day after sailed over and set up a\r\ntrophy, which, as they were not masters of the country, was however\r\npulled down by the Milesians. Meanwhile Leon and Diomedon with the\r\nAthenian fleet from Lesbos issuing from the Oenussae, the isles off\r\nChios, and from their forts of Sidussa and Pteleum in the Erythraeid,\r\nand from Lesbos, carried on the war against the Chians from the ships,\r\nhaving on board heavy infantry from the rolls pressed to serve as\r\nmarines. Landing in Cardamyle and in Bolissus they defeated with heavy\r\nloss the Chians that took the field against them and, laying desolate\r\nthe places in that neighbourhood, defeated the Chians again in another\r\nbattle at Phanae, and in a third at Leuconium. After this the Chians\r\nceased to meet them in the field, while the Athenians devastated the\r\ncountry, which was beautifully stocked and had remained uninjured ever\r\nsince the Median wars. Indeed, after the Lacedaemonians, the Chians are\r\nthe only people that I have known who knew how to be wise in\r\nprosperity, and who ordered their city the more securely the greater it\r\ngrew. Nor was this revolt, in which they might seem to have erred on\r\nthe side of rashness, ventured upon until they had numerous and gallant\r\nallies to share the danger with them, and until they perceived the\r\nAthenians after the Sicilian disaster themselves no longer denying the\r\nthoroughly desperate state of their affairs. And if they were thrown\r\nout by one of the surprises which upset human calculations, they found\r\nout their mistake in company with many others who believed, like them,\r\nin the speedy collapse of the Athenian power. While they were thus\r\nblockaded from the sea and plundered by land, some of the citizens\r\nundertook to bring the city over to the Athenians. Apprised of this the\r\nauthorities took no action themselves, but brought Astyochus, the\r\nadmiral, from Erythrae, with four ships that he had with him, and\r\nconsidered how they could most quietly, either by taking hostages or by\r\nsome other means, put an end to the conspiracy.\r\n\r\nWhile the Chians were thus engaged, a thousand Athenian heavy infantry\r\nand fifteen hundred Argives (five hundred of whom were light troops\r\nfurnished with armour by the Athenians), and one thousand of the\r\nallies, towards the close of the same summer sailed from Athens in\r\nforty-eight ships, some of which were transports, under the command of\r\nPhrynichus, Onomacles, and Scironides, and putting into Samos crossed\r\nover and encamped at Miletus. Upon this the Milesians came out to the\r\nnumber of eight hundred heavy infantry, with the Peloponnesians who had\r\ncome with Chalcideus, and some foreign mercenaries of Tissaphernes,\r\nTissaphernes himself and his cavalry, and engaged the Athenians and\r\ntheir allies. While the Argives rushed forward on their own wing with\r\nthe careless disdain of men advancing against Ionians who would never\r\nstand their charge, and were defeated by the Milesians with a loss\r\nlittle short of three hundred men, the Athenians first defeated the\r\nPeloponnesians, and driving before them the barbarians and the ruck of\r\nthe army, without engaging the Milesians, who after the rout of the\r\nArgives retreated into the town upon seeing their comrades worsted,\r\ncrowned their victory by grounding their arms under the very walls of\r\nMiletus. Thus, in this battle, the Ionians on both sides overcame the\r\nDorians, the Athenians defeating the Peloponnesians opposed to them,\r\nand the Milesians the Argives. After setting up a trophy, the Athenians\r\nprepared to draw a wall round the place, which stood upon an isthmus;\r\nthinking that, if they could gain Miletus, the other towns also would\r\neasily come over to them.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile about dusk tidings reached them that the fifty-five ships\r\nfrom Peloponnese and Sicily might be instantly expected. Of these the\r\nSiceliots, urged principally by the Syracusan Hermocrates to join in\r\ngiving the finishing blow to the power of Athens, furnished\r\ntwenty-two—twenty from Syracuse, and two from Silenus; and the ships\r\nthat we left preparing in Peloponnese being now ready, both squadrons\r\nhad been entrusted to Therimenes, a Lacedaemonian, to take to\r\nAstyochus, the admiral. They now put in first at Leros the island off\r\nMiletus, and from thence, discovering that the Athenians were before\r\nthe town, sailed into the Iasic Gulf, in order to learn how matters\r\nstood at Miletus. Meanwhile Alcibiades came on horseback to Teichiussa\r\nin the Milesian territory, the point of the gulf at which they had put\r\nin for the night, and told them of the battle in which he had fought in\r\nperson by the side of the Milesians and Tissaphernes, and advised them,\r\nif they did not wish to sacrifice Ionia and their cause, to fly to the\r\nrelief of Miletus and hinder its investment.\r\n\r\nAccordingly they resolved to relieve it the next morning. Meanwhile\r\nPhrynichus, the Athenian commander, had received precise intelligence\r\nof the fleet from Leros, and when his colleagues expressed a wish to\r\nkeep the sea and fight it out, flatly refused either to stay himself or\r\nto let them or any one else do so if he could help it. Where they could\r\nhereafter contend, after full and undisturbed preparation, with an\r\nexact knowledge of the number of the enemy’s fleet and of the force\r\nwhich they could oppose to him, he would never allow the reproach of\r\ndisgrace to drive him into a risk that was unreasonable. It was no\r\ndisgrace for an Athenian fleet to retreat when it suited them: put it\r\nas they would, it would be more disgraceful to be beaten, and to expose\r\nthe city not only to disgrace, but to the most serious danger. After\r\nits late misfortunes it could hardly be justified in voluntarily taking\r\nthe offensive even with the strongest force, except in a case of\r\nabsolute necessity: much less then without compulsion could it rush\r\nupon peril of its own seeking. He told them to take up their wounded as\r\nquickly as they could and the troops and stores which they had brought\r\nwith them, and leaving behind what they had taken from the enemy’s\r\ncountry, in order to lighten the ships, to sail off to Samos, and there\r\nconcentrating all their ships to attack as opportunity served. As he\r\nspoke so he acted; and thus not now more than afterwards, nor in this\r\nalone but in all that he had to do with, did Phrynichus show himself a\r\nman of sense. In this way that very evening the Athenians broke up from\r\nbefore Miletus, leaving their victory unfinished, and the Argives,\r\nmortified at their disaster, promptly sailed off home from Samos.\r\n\r\nAs soon as it was morning the Peloponnesians weighed from Teichiussa\r\nand put into Miletus after the departure of the Athenians; they stayed\r\none day, and on the next took with them the Chian vessels originally\r\nchased into port with Chalcideus, and resolved to sail back for the\r\ntackle which they had put on shore at Teichiussa. Upon their arrival\r\nTissaphernes came to them with his land forces and induced them to sail\r\nto Iasus, which was held by his enemy Amorges. Accordingly they\r\nsuddenly attacked and took Iasus, whose inhabitants never imagined that\r\nthe ships could be other than Athenian. The Syracusans distinguished\r\nthemselves most in the action. Amorges, a bastard of Pissuthnes and a\r\nrebel from the King, was taken alive and handed over to Tissaphernes,\r\nto carry to the King, if he chose, according to his orders: Iasus was\r\nsacked by the army, who found a very great booty there, the place being\r\nwealthy from ancient date. The mercenaries serving with Amorges the\r\nPeloponnesians received and enrolled in their army without doing them\r\nany harm, since most of them came from Peloponnese, and handed over the\r\ntown to Tissaphernes with all the captives, bond or free, at the\r\nstipulated price of one Doric stater a head; after which they returned\r\nto Miletus. Pedaritus, son of Leon, who had been sent by the\r\nLacedaemonians to take the command at Chios, they dispatched by land as\r\nfar as Erythrae with the mercenaries taken from Amorges; appointing\r\nPhilip to remain as governor of Miletus.\r\n\r\nSummer was now over. The winter following, Tissaphernes put Iasus in a\r\nstate of defence, and passing on to Miletus distributed a month’s pay\r\nto all the ships as he had promised at Lacedaemon, at the rate of an\r\nAttic drachma a day for each man. In future, however, he was resolved\r\nnot to give more than three obols, until he had consulted the King;\r\nwhen if the King should so order he would give, he said, the full\r\ndrachma. However, upon the protest of the Syracusan general Hermocrates\r\n(for as Therimenes was not admiral, but only accompanied them in order\r\nto hand over the ships to Astyochus, he made little difficulty about\r\nthe pay), it was agreed that the amount of five ships’ pay should be\r\ngiven over and above the three obols a day for each man; Tissaphernes\r\npaying thirty talents a month for fifty-five ships, and to the rest,\r\nfor as many ships as they had beyond that number, at the same rate.\r\n\r\nThe same winter the Athenians in Samos, having been joined by\r\nthirty-five more vessels from home under Charminus, Strombichides, and\r\nEuctemon, called in their squadron at Chios and all the rest, intending\r\nto blockade Miletus with their navy, and to send a fleet and an army\r\nagainst Chios; drawing lots for the respective services. This intention\r\nthey carried into effect; Strombichides, Onamacles, and Euctemon\r\nsailing against Chios, which fell to their lot, with thirty ships and a\r\npart of the thousand heavy infantry, who had been to Miletus, in\r\ntransports; while the rest remained masters of the sea with\r\nseventy-four ships at Samos, and advanced upon Miletus.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Astyochus, whom we left at Chios collecting the hostages\r\nrequired in consequence of the conspiracy, stopped upon learning that\r\nthe fleet with Therimenes had arrived, and that the affairs of the\r\nleague were in a more flourishing condition, and putting out to sea\r\nwith ten Peloponnesian and as many Chian vessels, after a futile attack\r\nupon Pteleum, coasted on to Clazomenae, and ordered the Athenian party\r\nto remove inland to Daphnus, and to join the Peloponnesians, an order\r\nin which also joined Tamos the king’s lieutenant in Ionia. This order\r\nbeing disregarded, Astyochus made an attack upon the town, which was\r\nunwalled, and having failed to take it was himself carried off by a\r\nstrong gale to Phocaea and Cuma, while the rest of the ships put in at\r\nthe islands adjacent to Clazomenae—Marathussa, Pele, and Drymussa. Here\r\nthey were detained eight days by the winds, and, plundering and\r\nconsuming all the property of the Clazomenians there deposited, put the\r\nrest on shipboard and sailed off to Phocaea and Cuma to join Astyochus.\r\n\r\nWhile he was there, envoys arrived from the Lesbians who wished to\r\nrevolt again. With Astyochus they were successful; but the Corinthians\r\nand the other allies being averse to it by reason of their former\r\nfailure, he weighed anchor and set sail for Chios, where they\r\neventually arrived from different quarters, the fleet having been\r\nscattered by a storm. After this Pedaritus, whom we left marching along\r\nthe coast from Miletus, arrived at Erythrae, and thence crossed over\r\nwith his army to Chios, where he found also about five hundred soldiers\r\nwho had been left there by Chalcideus from the five ships with their\r\narms. Meanwhile some Lesbians making offers to revolt, Astyochus urged\r\nupon Pedaritus and the Chians that they ought to go with their ships\r\nand effect the revolt of Lesbos, and so increase the number of their\r\nallies, or, if not successful, at all events harm the Athenians. The\r\nChians, however, turned a deaf ear to this, and Pedaritus flatly\r\nrefused to give up to him the Chian vessels.\r\n\r\nUpon this Astyochus took five Corinthian and one Megarian vessel, with\r\nanother from Hermione, and the ships which had come with him from\r\nLaconia, and set sail for Miletus to assume his command as admiral;\r\nafter telling the Chians with many threats that he would certainly not\r\ncome and help them if they should be in need. At Corycus in the\r\nErythraeid he brought to for the night; the Athenian armament sailing\r\nfrom Samos against Chios being only separated from him by a hill, upon\r\nthe other side of which it brought to; so that neither perceived the\r\nother. But a letter arriving in the night from Pedaritus to say that\r\nsome liberated Erythraean prisoners had come from Samos to betray\r\nErythrae, Astyochus at once put back to Erythrae, and so just escaped\r\nfalling in with the Athenians. Here Pedaritus sailed over to join him;\r\nand after inquiry into the pretended treachery, finding that the whole\r\nstory had been made up to procure the escape of the men from Samos,\r\nthey acquitted them of the charge, and sailed away, Pedaritus to Chios\r\nand Astyochus to Miletus as he had intended.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Athenian armament sailing round Corycus fell in with\r\nthree Chian men-of-war off Arginus, and gave immediate chase. A great\r\nstorm coming on, the Chians with difficulty took refuge in the harbour;\r\nthe three Athenian vessels most forward in the pursuit being wrecked\r\nand thrown up near the city of Chios, and the crews slain or taken\r\nprisoners. The rest of the Athenian fleet took refuge in the harbour\r\ncalled Phoenicus, under Mount Mimas, and from thence afterwards put\r\ninto Lesbos and prepared for the work of fortification.\r\n\r\nThe same winter the Lacedaemonian Hippocrates sailed out from\r\nPeloponnese with ten Thurian ships under the command of Dorieus, son of\r\nDiagoras, and two colleagues, one Laconian and one Syracusan vessel,\r\nand arrived at Cnidus, which had already revolted at the instigation of\r\nTissaphernes. When their arrival was known at Miletus, orders came to\r\nthem to leave half their squadron to guard Cnidus, and with the rest to\r\ncruise round Triopium and seize all the merchantmen arriving from\r\nEgypt. Triopium is a promontory of Cnidus and sacred to Apollo. This\r\ncoming to the knowledge of the Athenians, they sailed from Samos and\r\ncaptured the six ships on the watch at Triopium, the crews escaping out\r\nof them. After this the Athenians sailed into Cnidus and made an\r\nassault upon the town, which was unfortified, and all but took it; and\r\nthe next day assaulted it again, but with less effect, as the\r\ninhabitants had improved their defences during the night, and had been\r\nreinforced by the crews escaped from the ships at Triopium. The\r\nAthenians now withdrew, and after plundering the Cnidian territory\r\nsailed back to Samos.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Astyochus came to the fleet at Miletus. The\r\nPeloponnesian camp was still plentifully supplied, being in receipt of\r\nsufficient pay, and the soldiers having still in hand the large booty\r\ntaken at Iasus. The Milesians also showed great ardour for the war.\r\nNevertheless the Peloponnesians thought the first convention with\r\nTissaphernes, made with Chalcideus, defective, and more advantageous to\r\nhim than to them, and consequently while Therimenes was still there\r\nconcluded another, which was as follows:\r\n\r\nThe convention of the Lacedaemonians and the allies with King Darius\r\nand the sons of the King, and with Tissaphernes for a treaty and\r\nfriendship, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Neither the Lacedaemonians nor the allies of the Lacedaemonians\r\nshall make war against or otherwise injure any country or cities that\r\nbelong to King Darius or did belong to his father or to his ancestors;\r\nneither shall the Lacedaemonians nor the allies of the Lacedaemonians\r\nexact tribute from such cities. Neither shall King Darius nor any of\r\nthe subjects of the King make war against or otherwise injure the\r\nLacedaemonians or their allies.\r\n\r\n2. If the Lacedaemonians or their allies should require any assistance\r\nfrom the King, or the King from the Lacedaemonians or their allies,\r\nwhatever they both agree upon they shall be right in doing.\r\n\r\n3. Both shall carry on jointly the war against the Athenians and their\r\nallies: and if they make peace, both shall do so jointly.\r\n\r\n4. The expense of all troops in the King’s country, sent for by the\r\nKing, shall be borne by the King.\r\n\r\n5. If any of the states comprised in this convention with the King\r\nattack the King’s country, the rest shall stop them and aid the King to\r\nthe best of their power. And if any in the King’s country or in the\r\ncountries under the King’s rule attack the country of the\r\nLacedaemonians or their allies, the King shall stop it and help them to\r\nthe best of his power.\r\n\r\nAfter this convention Therimenes handed over the fleet to Astyochus,\r\nsailed off in a small boat, and was lost. The Athenian armament had now\r\ncrossed over from Lesbos to Chios, and being master by sea and land\r\nbegan to fortify Delphinium, a place naturally strong on the land side,\r\nprovided with more than one harbour, and also not far from the city of\r\nChios. Meanwhile the Chians remained inactive. Already defeated in so\r\nmany battles, they were now also at discord among themselves; the\r\nexecution of the party of Tydeus, son of Ion, by Pedaritus upon the\r\ncharge of Atticism, followed by the forcible imposition of an oligarchy\r\nupon the rest of the city, having made them suspicious of one another;\r\nand they therefore thought neither themselves not the mercenaries under\r\nPedaritus a match for the enemy. They sent, however, to Miletus to beg\r\nAstyochus to assist them, which he refused to do, and was accordingly\r\ndenounced at Lacedaemon by Pedaritus as a traitor. Such was the state\r\nof the Athenian affairs at Chios; while their fleet at Samos kept\r\nsailing out against the enemy in Miletus, until they found that he\r\nwould not accept their challenge, and then retired again to Samos and\r\nremained quiet.\r\n\r\nIn the same winter the twenty-seven ships equipped by the\r\nLacedaemonians for Pharnabazus through the agency of the Megarian\r\nCalligeitus, and the Cyzicene Timagoras, put out from Peloponnese and\r\nsailed for Ionia about the time of the solstice, under the command of\r\nAntisthenes, a Spartan. With them the Lacedaemonians also sent eleven\r\nSpartans as advisers to Astyochus; Lichas, son of Arcesilaus, being\r\namong the number. Arrived at Miletus, their orders were to aid in\r\ngenerally superintending the good conduct of the war; to send off the\r\nabove ships or a greater or less number to the Hellespont to\r\nPharnabazus, if they thought proper, appointing Clearchus, son of\r\nRamphias, who sailed with them, to the command; and further, if they\r\nthought proper, to make Antisthenes admiral, dismissing Astyochus, whom\r\nthe letters of Pedaritus had caused to be regarded with suspicion.\r\nSailing accordingly from Malea across the open sea, the squadron\r\ntouched at Melos and there fell in with ten Athenian ships, three of\r\nwhich they took empty and burned. After this, being afraid that the\r\nAthenian vessels escaped from Melos might, as they in fact did, give\r\ninformation of their approach to the Athenians at Samos, they sailed to\r\nCrete, and having lengthened their voyage by way of precaution made\r\nland at Caunus in Asia, from whence considering themselves in safety\r\nthey sent a message to the fleet at Miletus for a convoy along the\r\ncoast.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Chians and Pedaritus, undeterred by the backwardness of\r\nAstyochus, went on sending messengers pressing him to come with all the\r\nfleet to assist them against their besiegers, and not to leave the\r\ngreatest of the allied states in Ionia to be shut up by sea and overrun\r\nand pillaged by land. There were more slaves at Chios than in any one\r\nother city except Lacedaemon, and being also by reason of their numbers\r\npunished more rigorously when they offended, most of them, when they\r\nsaw the Athenian armament firmly established in the island with a\r\nfortified position, immediately deserted to the enemy, and through\r\ntheir knowledge of the country did the greatest mischief. The Chians\r\ntherefore urged upon Astyochus that it was his duty to assist them,\r\nwhile there was still a hope and a possibility of stopping the enemy’s\r\nprogress, while Delphinium was still in process of fortification and\r\nunfinished, and before the completion of a higher rampart which was\r\nbeing added to protect the camp and fleet of their besiegers. Astyochus\r\nnow saw that the allies also wished it and prepared to go, in spite of\r\nhis intention to the contrary owing to the threat already referred to.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime news came from Caunus of the arrival of the\r\ntwenty-seven ships with the Lacedaemonian commissioners; and Astyochus,\r\npostponing everything to the duty of convoying a fleet of that\r\nimportance, in order to be more able to command the sea, and to the\r\nsafe conduct of the Lacedaemonians sent as spies over his behaviour, at\r\nonce gave up going to Chios and set sail for Caunus. As he coasted\r\nalong he landed at the Meropid Cos and sacked the city, which was\r\nunfortified and had been lately laid in ruins by an earthquake, by far\r\nthe greatest in living memory, and, as the inhabitants had fled to the\r\nmountains, overran the country and made booty of all it contained,\r\nletting go, however, the free men. From Cos arriving in the night at\r\nCnidus he was constrained by the representations of the Cnidians not to\r\ndisembark the sailors, but to sail as he was straight against the\r\ntwenty Athenian vessels, which with Charminus, one of the commanders at\r\nSamos, were on the watch for the very twenty-seven ships from\r\nPeloponnese which Astyochus was himself sailing to join; the Athenians\r\nin Samos having heard from Melos of their approach, and Charminus being\r\non the look-out off Syme, Chalce, Rhodes, and Lycia, as he now heard\r\nthat they were at Caunus.\r\n\r\nAstyochus accordingly sailed as he was to Syme, before he was heard of,\r\nin the hope of catching the enemy somewhere out at sea. Rain, however,\r\nand foggy weather encountered him, and caused his ships to straggle and\r\nget into disorder in the dark. In the morning his fleet had parted\r\ncompany and was most of it still straggling round the island, and the\r\nleft wing only in sight of Charminus and the Athenians, who took it for\r\nthe squadron which they were watching for from Caunus, and hastily put\r\nout against it with part only of their twenty vessels, and attacking\r\nimmediately sank three ships and disabled others, and had the advantage\r\nin the action until the main body of the fleet unexpectedly hove in\r\nsight, when they were surrounded on every side. Upon this they took to\r\nflight, and after losing six ships with the rest escaped to Teutlussa\r\nor Beet Island, and from thence to Halicarnassus. After this the\r\nPeloponnesians put into Cnidus and, being joined by the twenty-seven\r\nships from Caunus, sailed all together and set up a trophy in Syme, and\r\nthen returned to anchor at Cnidus.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the Athenians knew of the sea-fight, they sailed with all\r\nthe ships at Samos to Syme, and, without attacking or being attacked by\r\nthe fleet at Cnidus, took the ships’ tackle left at Syme, and touching\r\nat Lorymi on the mainland sailed back to Samos. Meanwhile the\r\nPeloponnesian ships, being now all at Cnidus, underwent such repairs as\r\nwere needed; while the eleven Lacedaemonian commissioners conferred\r\nwith Tissaphernes, who had come to meet them, upon the points which did\r\nnot satisfy them in the past transactions, and upon the best and\r\nmutually most advantageous manner of conducting the war in future. The\r\nseverest critic of the present proceedings was Lichas, who said that\r\nneither of the treaties could stand, neither that of Chalcideus, nor\r\nthat of Therimenes; it being monstrous that the King should at this\r\ndate pretend to the possession of all the country formerly ruled by\r\nhimself or by his ancestors—a pretension which implicitly put back\r\nunder the yoke all the islands—Thessaly, Locris, and everything as far\r\nas Boeotia—and made the Lacedaemonians give to the Hellenes instead of\r\nliberty a Median master. He therefore invited Tissaphernes to conclude\r\nanother and a better treaty, as they certainly would not recognize\r\nthose existing and did not want any of his pay upon such conditions.\r\nThis offended Tissaphernes so much that he went away in a rage without\r\nsettling anything.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV\r\n\r\n\r\nTwentieth and Twenty-first Years of the War—Intrigues of\r\nAlcibiades—Withdrawal of the Persian Subsidies—Oligarchical Coup d’Etat\r\nat Athens—Patriotism of the Army at Samos\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Peloponnesians now determined to sail to Rhodes, upon the\r\ninvitation of some of the principal men there, hoping to gain an island\r\npowerful by the number of its seamen and by its land forces, and also\r\nthinking that they would be able to maintain their fleet from their own\r\nconfederacy, without having to ask for money from Tissaphernes. They\r\naccordingly at once set sail that same winter from Cnidus, and first\r\nput in with ninety-four ships at Camirus in the Rhodian country, to the\r\ngreat alarm of the mass of the inhabitants, who were not privy to the\r\nintrigue, and who consequently fled, especially as the town was\r\nunfortified. They were afterwards, however, assembled by the\r\nLacedaemonians together with the inhabitants of the two other towns of\r\nLindus and Ialysus; and the Rhodians were persuaded to revolt from the\r\nAthenians and the island went over to the Peloponnesians. Meanwhile the\r\nAthenians had received the alarm and set sail with the fleet from Samos\r\nto forestall them, and came within sight of the island, but being a\r\nlittle too late sailed off for the moment to Chalce, and from thence to\r\nSamos, and subsequently waged war against Rhodes, issuing from Chalce,\r\nCos, and Samos.\r\n\r\nThe Peloponnesians now levied a contribution of thirty-two talents from\r\nthe Rhodians, after which they hauled their ships ashore and for eighty\r\ndays remained inactive. During this time, and even earlier, before they\r\nremoved to Rhodes, the following intrigues took place. After the death\r\nof Chalcideus and the battle at Miletus, Alcibiades began to be\r\nsuspected by the Peloponnesians; and Astyochus received from Lacedaemon\r\nan order from them to put him to death, he being the personal enemy of\r\nAgis, and in other respects thought unworthy of confidence. Alcibiades\r\nin his alarm first withdrew to Tissaphernes, and immediately began to\r\ndo all he could with him to injure the Peloponnesian cause. Henceforth\r\nbecoming his adviser in everything, he cut down the pay from an Attic\r\ndrachma to three obols a day, and even this not paid too regularly; and\r\ntold Tissaphernes to say to the Peloponnesians that the Athenians,\r\nwhose maritime experience was of an older date than their own, only\r\ngave their men three obols, not so much from poverty as to prevent\r\ntheir seamen being corrupted by being too well off, and injuring their\r\ncondition by spending money upon enervating indulgences, and also paid\r\ntheir crews irregularly in order to have a security against their\r\ndeserting in the arrears which they would leave behind them. He also\r\ntold Tissaphernes to bribe the captains and generals of the cities, and\r\nso to obtain their connivance—an expedient which succeeded with all\r\nexcept the Syracusans, Hermocrates alone opposing him on behalf of the\r\nwhole confederacy. Meanwhile the cities asking for money Alcibiades\r\nsent off, by roundly telling them in the name of Tissaphernes that it\r\nwas great impudence in the Chians, the richest people in Hellas, not\r\ncontent with being defended by a foreign force, to expect others to\r\nrisk not only their lives but their money as well in behalf of their\r\nfreedom; while the other cities, he said, had had to pay largely to\r\nAthens before their rebellion, and could not justly refuse to\r\ncontribute as much or even more now for their own selves. He also\r\npointed out that Tissaphernes was at present carrying on the war at his\r\nown charges, and had good cause for economy, but that as soon as he\r\nreceived remittances from the king he would give them their pay in full\r\nand do what was reasonable for the cities.\r\n\r\nAlcibiades further advised Tissaphernes not to be in too great a hurry\r\nto end the war, or to let himself be persuaded to bring up the\r\nPhoenician fleet which he was equipping, or to provide pay for more\r\nHellenes, and thus put the power by land and sea into the same hands;\r\nbut to leave each of the contending parties in possession of one\r\nelement, thus enabling the king when he found one troublesome to call\r\nin the other. For if the command of the sea and land were united in one\r\nhand, he would not know where to turn for help to overthrow the\r\ndominant power; unless he at last chose to stand up himself, and go\r\nthrough with the struggle at great expense and hazard. The cheapest\r\nplan was to let the Hellenes wear each other out, at a small share of\r\nthe expense and without risk to himself. Besides, he would find the\r\nAthenians the most convenient partners in empire as they did not aim at\r\nconquests on shore, and carried on the war upon principles and with a\r\npractice most advantageous to the King; being prepared to combine to\r\nconquer the sea for Athens, and for the King all the Hellenes\r\ninhabiting his country, whom the Peloponnesians, on the contrary, had\r\ncome to liberate. Now it was not likely that the Lacedaemonians would\r\nfree the Hellenes from the Hellenic Athenians, without freeing them\r\nalso from the barbarian Mede, unless overthrown by him in the\r\nmeanwhile. Alcibiades therefore urged him to wear them both out at\r\nfirst, and, after docking the Athenian power as much as he could,\r\nforthwith to rid the country of the Peloponnesians. In the main\r\nTissaphernes approved of this policy, so far at least as could be\r\nconjectured from his behaviour; since he now gave his confidence to\r\nAlcibiades in recognition of his good advice, and kept the\r\nPeloponnesians short of money, and would not let them fight at sea, but\r\nruined their cause by pretending that the Phoenician fleet would\r\narrive, and that they would thus be enabled to contend with the odds in\r\ntheir favour, and so made their navy lose its efficiency, which had\r\nbeen very remarkable, and generally betrayed a coolness in the war that\r\nwas too plain to be mistaken.\r\n\r\nAlcibiades gave this advice to Tissaphernes and the King, with whom he\r\nthen was, not merely because he thought it really the best, but because\r\nhe was studying means to effect his restoration to his country, well\r\nknowing that if he did not destroy it he might one day hope to persuade\r\nthe Athenians to recall him, and thinking that his best chance of\r\npersuading them lay in letting them see that he possessed the favour of\r\nTissaphernes. The event proved him to be right. When the Athenians at\r\nSamos found that he had influence with Tissaphernes, principally of\r\ntheir own motion (though partly also through Alcibiades himself sending\r\nword to their chief men to tell the best men in the army that, if there\r\nwere only an oligarchy in the place of the rascally democracy that had\r\nbanished him, he would be glad to return to his country and to make\r\nTissaphernes their friend), the captains and chief men in the armament\r\nat once embraced the idea of subverting the democracy.\r\n\r\nThe design was first mooted in the camp, and afterwards from thence\r\nreached the city. Some persons crossed over from Samos and had an\r\ninterview with Alcibiades, who immediately offered to make first\r\nTissaphernes, and afterwards the King, their friend, if they would give\r\nup the democracy and make it possible for the King to trust them. The\r\nhigher class, who also suffered most severely from the war, now\r\nconceived great hopes of getting the government into their own hands,\r\nand of triumphing over the enemy. Upon their return to Samos the\r\nemissaries formed their partisans into a club, and openly told the mass\r\nof the armament that the King would be their friend, and would provide\r\nthem with money, if Alcibiades were restored and the democracy\r\nabolished. The multitude, if at first irritated by these intrigues,\r\nwere nevertheless kept quiet by the advantageous prospect of the pay\r\nfrom the King; and the oligarchical conspirators, after making this\r\ncommunication to the people, now re-examined the proposals of\r\nAlcibiades among themselves, with most of their associates. Unlike the\r\nrest, who thought them advantageous and trustworthy, Phrynichus, who\r\nwas still general, by no means approved of the proposals. Alcibiades,\r\nhe rightly thought, cared no more for an oligarchy than for a\r\ndemocracy, and only sought to change the institutions of his country in\r\norder to get himself recalled by his associates; while for themselves\r\ntheir one object should be to avoid civil discord. It was not the\r\nKing’s interest, when the Peloponnesians were now their equals at sea,\r\nand in possession of some of the chief cities in his empire, to go out\r\nof his way to side with the Athenians whom he did not trust, when he\r\nmight make friends of the Peloponnesians who had never injured him. And\r\nas for the allied states to whom oligarchy was now offered, because the\r\ndemocracy was to be put down at Athens, he well knew that this would\r\nnot make the rebels come in any the sooner, or confirm the loyal in\r\ntheir allegiance; as the allies would never prefer servitude with an\r\noligarchy or democracy to freedom with the constitution which they\r\nactually enjoyed, to whichever type it belonged. Besides, the cities\r\nthought that the so-called better classes would prove just as\r\noppressive as the commons, as being those who originated, proposed, and\r\nfor the most part benefited from the acts of the commons injurious to\r\nthe confederates. Indeed, if it depended on the better classes, the\r\nconfederates would be put to death without trial and with violence;\r\nwhile the commons were their refuge and the chastiser of these men.\r\nThis he positively knew that the cities had learned by experience, and\r\nthat such was their opinion. The propositions of Alcibiades, and the\r\nintrigues now in progress, could therefore never meet with his\r\napproval.\r\n\r\nHowever, the members of the club assembled, agreeably to their original\r\ndetermination, accepted what was proposed, and prepared to send\r\nPisander and others on an embassy to Athens to treat for the\r\nrestoration of Alcibiades and the abolition of the democracy in the\r\ncity, and thus to make Tissaphernes the friend of the Athenians.\r\n\r\nPhrynichus now saw that there would be a proposal to restore\r\nAlcibiades, and that the Athenians would consent to it; and fearing\r\nafter what he had said against it that Alcibiades, if restored, would\r\nrevenge himself upon him for his opposition, had recourse to the\r\nfollowing expedient. He sent a secret letter to the Lacedaemonian\r\nadmiral Astyochus, who was still in the neighbourhood of Miletus, to\r\ntell him that Alcibiades was ruining their cause by making Tissaphernes\r\nthe friend of the Athenians, and containing an express revelation of\r\nthe rest of the intrigue, desiring to be excused if he sought to harm\r\nhis enemy even at the expense of the interests of his country. However,\r\nAstyochus, instead of thinking of punishing Alcibiades, who, besides,\r\nno longer ventured within his reach as formerly, went up to him and\r\nTissaphernes at Magnesia, communicated to them the letter from Samos,\r\nand turned informer, and, if report may be trusted, became the paid\r\ncreature of Tissaphernes, undertaking to inform him as to this and all\r\nother matters; which was also the reason why he did not remonstrate\r\nmore strongly against the pay not being given in full. Upon this\r\nAlcibiades instantly sent to the authorities at Samos a letter against\r\nPhrynichus, stating what he had done, and requiring that he should be\r\nput to death. Phrynichus distracted, and placed in the utmost peril by\r\nthe denunciation, sent again to Astyochus, reproaching him with having\r\nso ill kept the secret of his previous letter, and saying that he was\r\nnow prepared to give them an opportunity of destroying the whole\r\nAthenian armament at Samos; giving a detailed account of the means\r\nwhich he should employ, Samos being unfortified, and pleading that,\r\nbeing in danger of his life on their account, he could not now be\r\nblamed for doing this or anything else to escape being destroyed by his\r\nmortal enemies. This also Astyochus revealed to Alcibiades.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Phrynichus having had timely notice that he was playing him\r\nfalse, and that a letter on the subject was on the point of arriving\r\nfrom Alcibiades, himself anticipated the news, and told the army that\r\nthe enemy, seeing that Samos was unfortified and the fleet not all\r\nstationed within the harbour, meant to attack the camp, that he could\r\nbe certain of this intelligence, and that they must fortify Samos as\r\nquickly as possible, and generally look to their defences. It will be\r\nremembered that he was general, and had himself authority to carry out\r\nthese measures. Accordingly they addressed themselves to the work of\r\nfortification, and Samos was thus fortified sooner than it would\r\notherwise have been. Not long afterwards came the letter from\r\nAlcibiades, saying that the army was betrayed by Phrynichus, and the\r\nenemy about to attack it. Alcibiades, however, gained no credit, it\r\nbeing thought that he was in the secret of the enemy’s designs, and had\r\ntried to fasten them upon Phrynichus, and to make out that he was their\r\naccomplice, out of hatred; and consequently far from hurting him he\r\nrather bore witness to what he had said by this intelligence.\r\n\r\nAfter this Alcibiades set to work to persuade Tissaphernes to become\r\nthe friend of the Athenians. Tissaphernes, although afraid of the\r\nPeloponnesians because they had more ships in Asia than the Athenians,\r\nwas yet disposed to be persuaded if he could, especially after his\r\nquarrel with the Peloponnesians at Cnidus about the treaty of\r\nTherimenes. The quarrel had already taken place, as the Peloponnesians\r\nwere by this time actually at Rhodes; and in it the original argument\r\nof Alcibiades touching the liberation of all the towns by the\r\nLacedaemonians had been verified by the declaration of Lichas that it\r\nwas impossible to submit to a convention which made the King master of\r\nall the states at any former time ruled by himself or by his fathers.\r\n\r\nWhile Alcibiades was besieging the favour of Tissaphernes with an\r\nearnestness proportioned to the greatness of the issue, the Athenian\r\nenvoys who had been dispatched from Samos with Pisander arrived at\r\nAthens, and made a speech before the people, giving a brief summary of\r\ntheir views, and particularly insisting that, if Alcibiades were\r\nrecalled and the democratic constitution changed, they could have the\r\nKing as their ally, and would be able to overcome the Peloponnesians. A\r\nnumber of speakers opposed them on the question of the democracy, the\r\nenemies of Alcibiades cried out against the scandal of a restoration to\r\nbe effected by a violation of the constitution, and the Eumolpidae and\r\nCeryces protested in behalf of the mysteries, the cause of his\r\nbanishment, and called upon the gods to avert his recall; when\r\nPisander, in the midst of much opposition and abuse, came forward, and\r\ntaking each of his opponents aside asked him the following question: In\r\nthe face of the fact that the Peloponnesians had as many ships as their\r\nown confronting them at sea, more cities in alliance with them, and the\r\nKing and Tissaphernes to supply them with money, of which the Athenians\r\nhad none left, had he any hope of saving the state, unless someone\r\ncould induce the King to come over to their side? Upon their replying\r\nthat they had not, he then plainly said to them: “This we cannot have\r\nunless we have a more moderate form of government, and put the offices\r\ninto fewer hands, and so gain the King’s confidence, and forthwith\r\nrestore Alcibiades, who is the only man living that can bring this\r\nabout. The safety of the state, not the form of its government, is for\r\nthe moment the most pressing question, as we can always change\r\nafterwards whatever we do not like.”\r\n\r\nThe people were at first highly irritated at the mention of an\r\noligarchy, but upon understanding clearly from Pisander that this was\r\nthe only resource left, they took counsel of their fears, and promised\r\nthemselves some day to change the government again, and gave way. They\r\naccordingly voted that Pisander should sail with ten others and make\r\nthe best arrangement that they could with Tissaphernes and Alcibiades.\r\nAt the same time the people, upon a false accusation of Pisander,\r\ndismissed Phrynichus from his post together with his colleague\r\nScironides, sending Diomedon and Leon to replace them in the command of\r\nthe fleet. The accusation was that Phrynichus had betrayed Iasus and\r\nAmorges; and Pisander brought it because he thought him a man unfit for\r\nthe business now in hand with Alcibiades. Pisander also went the round\r\nof all the clubs already existing in the city for help in lawsuits and\r\nelections, and urged them to draw together and to unite their efforts\r\nfor the overthrow of the democracy; and after taking all other measures\r\nrequired by the circumstances, so that no time might be lost, set off\r\nwith his ten companions on his voyage to Tissaphernes.\r\n\r\nIn the same winter Leon and Diomedon, who had by this time joined the\r\nfleet, made an attack upon Rhodes. The ships of the Peloponnesians they\r\nfound hauled up on shore, and, after making a descent upon the coast\r\nand defeating the Rhodians who appeared in the field against them,\r\nwithdrew to Chalce and made that place their base of operations instead\r\nof Cos, as they could better observe from thence if the Peloponnesian\r\nfleet put out to sea. Meanwhile Xenophantes, a Laconian, came to Rhodes\r\nfrom Pedaritus at Chios, with the news that the fortification of the\r\nAthenians was now finished, and that, unless the whole Peloponnesian\r\nfleet came to the rescue, the cause in Chios must be lost. Upon this\r\nthey resolved to go to his relief. In the meantime Pedaritus, with the\r\nmercenaries that he had with him and the whole force of the Chians,\r\nmade an assault upon the work round the Athenian ships and took a\r\nportion of it, and got possession of some vessels that were hauled up\r\non shore, when the Athenians sallied out to the rescue, and first\r\nrouting the Chians, next defeated the remainder of the force round\r\nPedaritus, who was himself killed, with many of the Chians, a great\r\nnumber of arms being also taken.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Chians were besieged even more straitly than before by\r\nland and sea, and the famine in the place was great. Meanwhile the\r\nAthenian envoys with Pisander arrived at the court of Tissaphernes, and\r\nconferred with him about the proposed agreement. However, Alcibiades,\r\nnot being altogether sure of Tissaphernes (who feared the\r\nPeloponnesians more than the Athenians, and besides wished to wear out\r\nboth parties, as Alcibiades himself had recommended), had recourse to\r\nthe following stratagem to make the treaty between the Athenians and\r\nTissaphernes miscarry by reason of the magnitude of his demands. In my\r\nopinion Tissaphernes desired this result, fear being his motive; while\r\nAlcibiades, who now saw that Tissaphernes was determined not to treat\r\non any terms, wished the Athenians to think, not that he was unable to\r\npersuade Tissaphernes, but that after the latter had been persuaded and\r\nwas willing to join them, they had not conceded enough to him. For the\r\ndemands of Alcibiades, speaking for Tissaphernes, who was present, were\r\nso extravagant that the Athenians, although for a long while they\r\nagreed to whatever he asked, yet had to bear the blame of failure: he\r\nrequired the cession of the whole of Ionia, next of the islands\r\nadjacent, besides other concessions, and these passed without\r\nopposition; at last, in the third interview, Alcibiades, who now feared\r\na complete discovery of his inability, required them to allow the King\r\nto build ships and sail along his own coast wherever and with as many\r\nas he pleased. Upon this the Athenians would yield no further, and\r\nconcluding that there was nothing to be done, but that they had been\r\ndeceived by Alcibiades, went away in a passion and proceeded to Samos.\r\n\r\nTissaphernes immediately after this, in the same winter, proceeded\r\nalong shore to Caunus, desiring to bring the Peloponnesian fleet back\r\nto Miletus, and to supply them with pay, making a fresh convention upon\r\nsuch terms as he could get, in order not to bring matters to an\r\nabsolute breach between them. He was afraid that if many of their ships\r\nwere left without pay they would be compelled to engage and be\r\ndefeated, or that their vessels being left without hands the Athenians\r\nwould attain their objects without his assistance. Still more he feared\r\nthat the Peloponnesians might ravage the continent in search of\r\nsupplies. Having calculated and considered all this, agreeably to his\r\nplan of keeping the two sides equal, he now sent for the Peloponnesians\r\nand gave them pay, and concluded with them a third treaty in words\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\nIn the thirteenth year of the reign of Darius, while Alexippidas was\r\nephor at Lacedaemon, a convention was concluded in the plain of the\r\nMaeander by the Lacedaemonians and their allies with Tissaphernes,\r\nHieramenes, and the sons of Pharnaces, concerning the affairs of the\r\nKing and of the Lacedaemonians and their allies.\r\n\r\n1. The country of the King in Asia shall be the King’s, and the King\r\nshall treat his own country as he pleases.\r\n\r\n2. The Lacedaemonians and their allies shall not invade or injure the\r\nKing’s country: neither shall the King invade or injure that of the\r\nLacedaemonians or of their allies. If any of the Lacedaemonians or of\r\ntheir allies invade or injure the King’s country, the Lacedaemonians\r\nand their allies shall prevent it: and if any from the King’s country\r\ninvade or injure the country of the Lacedaemonians or of their allies,\r\nthe King shall prevent it.\r\n\r\n3. Tissaphernes shall provide pay for the ships now present, according\r\nto the agreement, until the arrival of the King’s vessels: but after\r\nthe arrival of the King’s vessels the Lacedaemonians and their allies\r\nmay pay their own ships if they wish it. If, however, they choose to\r\nreceive the pay from Tissaphernes, Tissaphernes shall furnish it: and\r\nthe Lacedaemonians and their allies shall repay him at the end of the\r\nwar such moneys as they shall have received.\r\n\r\n4. After the vessels have arrived, the ships of the Lacedaemonians and\r\nof their allies and those of the King shall carry on the war jointly,\r\naccording as Tissaphernes and the Lacedaemonians and their allies shall\r\nthink best. If they wish to make peace with the Athenians, they shall\r\nmake peace also jointly.\r\n\r\nThis was the treaty. After this Tissaphernes prepared to bring up the\r\nPhoenician fleet according to agreement, and to make good his other\r\npromises, or at all events wished to make it appear that he was so\r\npreparing.\r\n\r\nWinter was now drawing towards its close, when the Boeotians took\r\nOropus by treachery, though held by an Athenian garrison. Their\r\naccomplices in this were some of the Eretrians and of the Oropians\r\nthemselves, who were plotting the revolt of Euboea, as the place was\r\nexactly opposite Eretria, and while in Athenian hands was necessarily a\r\nsource of great annoyance to Eretria and the rest of Euboea. Oropus\r\nbeing in their hands, the Eretrians now came to Rhodes to invite the\r\nPeloponnesians into Euboea. The latter, however, were rather bent on\r\nthe relief of the distressed Chians, and accordingly put out to sea and\r\nsailed with all their ships from Rhodes. Off Triopium they sighted the\r\nAthenian fleet out at sea sailing from Chalce, and, neither attacking\r\nthe other, arrived, the latter at Samos, the Peloponnesians at Miletus,\r\nseeing that it was no longer possible to relieve Chios without a\r\nbattle. And this winter ended, and with it ended the twentieth year of\r\nthis war of which Thucydides is the historian.\r\n\r\nEarly in the spring of the summer following, Dercyllidas, a Spartan,\r\nwas sent with a small force by land to the Hellespont to effect the\r\nrevolt of Abydos, which is a Milesian colony; and the Chians, while\r\nAstyochus was at a loss how to help them, were compelled to fight at\r\nsea by the pressure of the siege. While Astyochus was still at Rhodes\r\nthey had received from Miletus, as their commander after the death of\r\nPedaritus, a Spartan named Leon, who had come out with Antisthenes, and\r\ntwelve vessels which had been on guard at Miletus, five of which were\r\nThurian, four Syracusans, one from Anaia, one Milesian, and one Leon’s\r\nown. Accordingly the Chians marched out in mass and took up a strong\r\nposition, while thirty-six of their ships put out and engaged\r\nthirty-two of the Athenians; and after a tough fight, in which the\r\nChians and their allies had rather the best of it, as it was now late,\r\nretired to their city.\r\n\r\nImmediately after this Dercyllidas arrived by land from Miletus; and\r\nAbydos in the Hellespont revolted to him and Pharnabazus, and Lampsacus\r\ntwo days later. Upon receipt of this news Strombichides hastily sailed\r\nfrom Chios with twenty-four Athenian ships, some transports carrying\r\nheavy infantry being of the number, and defeating the Lampsacenes who\r\ncame out against him, took Lampsacus, which was unfortified, at the\r\nfirst assault, and making prize of the slaves and goods restored the\r\nfreemen to their homes, and went on to Abydos. The inhabitants,\r\nhowever, refusing to capitulate, and his assaults failing to take the\r\nplace, he sailed over to the coast opposite, and appointed Sestos, the\r\ntown in the Chersonese held by the Medes at a former period in this\r\nhistory, as the centre for the defence of the whole Hellespont.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime the Chians commanded the sea more than before; and the\r\nPeloponnesians at Miletus and Astyochus, hearing of the sea-fight and\r\nof the departure of the squadron with Strombichides, took fresh\r\ncourage. Coasting along with two vessels to Chios, Astyochus took the\r\nships from that place, and now moved with the whole fleet upon Samos,\r\nfrom whence, however, he sailed back to Miletus, as the Athenians did\r\nnot put out against him, owing to their suspicions of one another. For\r\nit was about this time, or even before, that the democracy was put down\r\nat Athens. When Pisander and the envoys returned from Tissaphernes to\r\nSamos they at once strengthened still further their interest in the\r\narmy itself, and instigated the upper class in Samos to join them in\r\nestablishing an oligarchy, the very form of government which a party of\r\nthem had lately risen to avoid. At the same time the Athenians at\r\nSamos, after a consultation among themselves, determined to let\r\nAlcibiades alone, since he refused to join them, and besides was not\r\nthe man for an oligarchy; and now that they were once embarked, to see\r\nfor themselves how they could best prevent the ruin of their cause, and\r\nmeanwhile to sustain the war, and to contribute without stint money and\r\nall else that might be required from their own private estates, as they\r\nwould henceforth labour for themselves alone.\r\n\r\nAfter encouraging each other in these resolutions, they now at once\r\nsent off half the envoys and Pisander to do what was necessary at\r\nAthens (with instructions to establish oligarchies on their way in all\r\nthe subject cities which they might touch at), and dispatched the other\r\nhalf in different directions to the other dependencies. Diitrephes\r\nalso, who was in the neighbourhood of Chios, and had been elected to\r\nthe command of the Thracian towns, was sent off to his government, and\r\narriving at Thasos abolished the democracy there. Two months, however,\r\nhad not elapsed after his departure before the Thasians began to\r\nfortify their town, being already tired of an aristocracy with Athens,\r\nand in daily expectation of freedom from Lacedaemon. Indeed there was a\r\nparty of them (whom the Athenians had banished), with the\r\nPeloponnesians, who with their friends in the town were already making\r\nevery exertion to bring a squadron, and to effect the revolt of Thasos;\r\nand this party thus saw exactly what they most wanted done, that is to\r\nsay, the reformation of the government without risk, and the abolition\r\nof the democracy which would have opposed them. Things at Thasos thus\r\nturned out just the contrary to what the oligarchical conspirators at\r\nAthens expected; and the same in my opinion was the case in many of the\r\nother dependencies; as the cities no sooner got a moderate government\r\nand liberty of action, than they went on to absolute freedom without\r\nbeing at all seduced by the show of reform offered by the Athenians.\r\n\r\nPisander and his colleagues on their voyage alongshore abolished, as\r\nhad been determined, the democracies in the cities, and also took some\r\nheavy infantry from certain places as their allies, and so came to\r\nAthens. Here they found most of the work already done by their\r\nassociates. Some of the younger men had banded together, and secretly\r\nassassinated one Androcles, the chief leader of the commons, and mainly\r\nresponsible for the banishment of Alcibiades; Androcles being singled\r\nout both because he was a popular leader and because they sought by his\r\ndeath to recommend themselves to Alcibiades, who was, as they supposed,\r\nto be recalled, and to make Tissaphernes their friend. There were also\r\nsome other obnoxious persons whom they secretly did away with in the\r\nsame manner. Meanwhile their cry in public was that no pay should be\r\ngiven except to persons serving in the war, and that not more than five\r\nthousand should share in the government, and those such as were most\r\nable to serve the state in person and in purse.\r\n\r\nBut this was a mere catchword for the multitude, as the authors of the\r\nrevolution were really to govern. However, the Assembly and the Council\r\nof the Bean still met notwithstanding, although they discussed nothing\r\nthat was not approved of by the conspirators, who both supplied the\r\nspeakers and reviewed in advance what they were to say. Fear, and the\r\nsight of the numbers of the conspirators, closed the mouths of the\r\nrest; or if any ventured to rise in opposition, he was presently put to\r\ndeath in some convenient way, and there was neither search for the\r\nmurderers nor justice to be had against them if suspected; but the\r\npeople remained motionless, being so thoroughly cowed that men thought\r\nthemselves lucky to escape violence, even when they held their tongues.\r\nAn exaggerated belief in the numbers of the conspirators also\r\ndemoralized the people, rendered helpless by the magnitude of the city,\r\nand by their want of intelligence with each other, and being without\r\nmeans of finding out what those numbers really were. For the same\r\nreason it was impossible for any one to open his grief to a neighbour\r\nand to concert measures to defend himself, as he would have had to\r\nspeak either to one whom he did not know, or whom he knew but did not\r\ntrust. Indeed all the popular party approached each other with\r\nsuspicion, each thinking his neighbour concerned in what was going on,\r\nthe conspirators having in their ranks persons whom no one could ever\r\nhave believed capable of joining an oligarchy; and these it was who\r\nmade the many so suspicious, and so helped to procure impunity for the\r\nfew, by confirming the commons in their mistrust of one another.\r\n\r\nAt this juncture arrived Pisander and his colleagues, who lost no time\r\nin doing the rest. First they assembled the people, and moved to elect\r\nten commissioners with full powers to frame a constitution, and that\r\nwhen this was done they should on an appointed day lay before the\r\npeople their opinion as to the best mode of governing the city.\r\nAfterwards, when the day arrived, the conspirators enclosed the\r\nassembly in Colonus, a temple of Poseidon, a little more than a mile\r\noutside the city; when the commissioners simply brought forward this\r\nsingle motion, that any Athenian might propose with impunity whatever\r\nmeasure he pleased, heavy penalties being imposed upon any who should\r\nindict for illegality, or otherwise molest him for so doing. The way\r\nthus cleared, it was now plainly declared that all tenure of office and\r\nreceipt of pay under the existing institutions were at an end, and that\r\nfive men must be elected as presidents, who should in their turn elect\r\none hundred, and each of the hundred three apiece; and that this body\r\nthus made up to four hundred should enter the council chamber with full\r\npowers and govern as they judged best, and should convene the five\r\nthousand whenever they pleased.\r\n\r\nThe man who moved this resolution was Pisander, who was throughout the\r\nchief ostensible agent in putting down the democracy. But he who\r\nconcerted the whole affair, and prepared the way for the catastrophe,\r\nand who had given the greatest thought to the matter, was Antiphon, one\r\nof the best men of his day in Athens; who, with a head to contrive\r\nmeasures and a tongue to recommend them, did not willingly come forward\r\nin the assembly or upon any public scene, being ill looked upon by the\r\nmultitude owing to his reputation for talent; and who yet was the one\r\nman best able to aid in the courts, or before the assembly, the suitors\r\nwho required his opinion. Indeed, when he was afterwards himself tried\r\nfor his life on the charge of having been concerned in setting up this\r\nvery government, when the Four Hundred were overthrown and hardly dealt\r\nwith by the commons, he made what would seem to be the best defence of\r\nany known up to my time. Phrynichus also went beyond all others in his\r\nzeal for the oligarchy. Afraid of Alcibiades, and assured that he was\r\nno stranger to his intrigues with Astyochus at Samos, he held that no\r\noligarchy was ever likely to restore him, and once embarked in the\r\nenterprise, proved, where danger was to be faced, by far the staunchest\r\nof them all. Theramenes, son of Hagnon, was also one of the foremost of\r\nthe subverters of the democracy—a man as able in council as in debate.\r\nConducted by so many and by such sagacious heads, the enterprise, great\r\nas it was, not unnaturally went forward; although it was no light\r\nmatter to deprive the Athenian people of its freedom, almost a hundred\r\nyears after the deposition of the tyrants, when it had been not only\r\nnot subject to any during the whole of that period, but accustomed\r\nduring more than half of it to rule over subjects of its own.\r\n\r\nThe assembly ratified the proposed constitution, without a single\r\nopposing voice, and was then dissolved; after which the Four Hundred\r\nwere brought into the council chamber in the following way. On account\r\nof the enemy at Decelea, all the Athenians were constantly on the wall\r\nor in the ranks at the various military posts. On that day the persons\r\nnot in the secret were allowed to go home as usual, while orders were\r\ngiven to the accomplices of the conspirators to hang about, without\r\nmaking any demonstration, at some little distance from the posts, and\r\nin case of any opposition to what was being done, to seize the arms and\r\nput it down. There were also some Andrians and Tenians, three hundred\r\nCarystians, and some of the settlers in Aegina come with their own arms\r\nfor this very purpose, who had received similar instructions. These\r\ndispositions completed, the Four Hundred went, each with a dagger\r\nconcealed about his person, accompanied by one hundred and twenty\r\nHellenic youths, whom they employed wherever violence was needed, and\r\nappeared before the Councillors of the Bean in the council chamber, and\r\ntold them to take their pay and be gone; themselves bringing it for the\r\nwhole of the residue of their term of office, and giving it to them as\r\nthey went out.\r\n\r\nUpon the Council withdrawing in this way without venturing any\r\nobjection, and the rest of the citizens making no movement, the Four\r\nHundred entered the council chamber, and for the present contented\r\nthemselves with drawing lots for their Prytanes, and making their\r\nprayers and sacrifices to the gods upon entering office, but afterwards\r\ndeparted widely from the democratic system of government, and except\r\nthat on account of Alcibiades they did not recall the exiles, ruled the\r\ncity by force; putting to death some men, though not many, whom they\r\nthought it convenient to remove, and imprisoning and banishing others.\r\nThey also sent to Agis, the Lacedaemonian king, at Decelea, to say that\r\nthey desired to make peace, and that he might reasonably be more\r\ndisposed to treat now that he had them to deal with instead of the\r\ninconstant commons.\r\n\r\nAgis, however, did not believe in the tranquillity of the city, or that\r\nthe commons would thus in a moment give up their ancient liberty, but\r\nthought that the sight of a large Lacedaemonian force would be\r\nsufficient to excite them if they were not already in commotion, of\r\nwhich he was by no means certain. He accordingly gave to the envoys of\r\nthe Four Hundred an answer which held out no hopes of an accommodation,\r\nand sending for large reinforcements from Peloponnese, not long\r\nafterwards, with these and his garrison from Decelea, descended to the\r\nvery walls of Athens; hoping either that civil disturbances might help\r\nto subdue them to his terms, or that, in the confusion to be expected\r\nwithin and without the city, they might even surrender without a blow\r\nbeing struck; at all events he thought he would succeed in seizing the\r\nLong Walls, bared of their defenders. However, the Athenians saw him\r\ncome close up, without making the least disturbance within the city;\r\nand sending out their cavalry, and a number of their heavy infantry,\r\nlight troops, and archers, shot down some of his soldiers who\r\napproached too near, and got possession of some arms and dead. Upon\r\nthis Agis, at last convinced, led his army back again and, remaining\r\nwith his own troops in the old position at Decelea, sent the\r\nreinforcement back home, after a few days’ stay in Attica. After this\r\nthe Four Hundred persevering sent another embassy to Agis, and now\r\nmeeting with a better reception, at his suggestion dispatched envoys to\r\nLacedaemon to negotiate a treaty, being desirous of making peace.\r\n\r\nThey also sent ten men to Samos to reassure the army, and to explain\r\nthat the oligarchy was not established for the hurt of the city or the\r\ncitizens, but for the salvation of the country at large; and that there\r\nwere five thousand, not four hundred only, concerned; although, what\r\nwith their expeditions and employments abroad, the Athenians had never\r\nyet assembled to discuss a question important enough to bring five\r\nthousand of them together. The emissaries were also told what to say\r\nupon all other points, and were so sent off immediately after the\r\nestablishment of the new government, which feared, as it turned out\r\njustly, that the mass of seamen would not be willing to remain under\r\nthe oligarchical constitution, and, the evil beginning there, might be\r\nthe means of their overthrow.\r\n\r\nIndeed at Samos the question of the oligarchy had already entered upon\r\na new phase, the following events having taken place just at the time\r\nthat the Four Hundred were conspiring. That part of the Samian\r\npopulation which has been mentioned as rising against the upper class,\r\nand as being the democratic party, had now turned round, and yielding\r\nto the solicitations of Pisander during his visit, and of the Athenians\r\nin the conspiracy at Samos, had bound themselves by oaths to the number\r\nof three hundred, and were about to fall upon the rest of their fellow\r\ncitizens, whom they now in their turn regarded as the democratic party.\r\nMeanwhile they put to death one Hyperbolus, an Athenian, a pestilent\r\nfellow that had been ostracized, not from fear of his influence or\r\nposition, but because he was a rascal and a disgrace to the city; being\r\naided in this by Charminus, one of the generals, and by some of the\r\nAthenians with them, to whom they had sworn friendship, and with whom\r\nthey perpetrated other acts of the kind, and now determined to attack\r\nthe people. The latter got wind of what was coming, and told two of the\r\ngenerals, Leon and Diomedon, who, on account of the credit which they\r\nenjoyed with the commons, were unwilling supporters of the oligarchy;\r\nand also Thrasybulus and Thrasyllus, the former a captain of a galley,\r\nthe latter serving with the heavy infantry, besides certain others who\r\nhad ever been thought most opposed to the conspirators, entreating them\r\nnot to look on and see them destroyed, and Samos, the sole remaining\r\nstay of their empire, lost to the Athenians. Upon hearing this, the\r\npersons whom they addressed now went round the soldiers one by one, and\r\nurged them to resist, especially the crew of the Paralus, which was\r\nmade up entirely of Athenians and freemen, and had from time out of\r\nmind been enemies of oligarchy, even when there was no such thing\r\nexisting; and Leon and Diomedon left behind some ships for their\r\nprotection in case of their sailing away anywhere themselves.\r\nAccordingly, when the Three Hundred attacked the people, all these came\r\nto the rescue, and foremost of all the crew of the Paralus; and the\r\nSamian commons gained the victory, and putting to death some thirty of\r\nthe Three Hundred, and banishing three others of the ringleaders,\r\naccorded an amnesty to the rest, and lived together under a democratic\r\ngovernment for the future.\r\n\r\nThe ship Paralus, with Chaereas, son of Archestratus, on board, an\r\nAthenian who had taken an active part in the revolution, was now\r\nwithout loss of time sent off by the Samians and the army to Athens to\r\nreport what had occurred; the fact that the Four Hundred were in power\r\nnot being yet known. When they sailed into harbour the Four Hundred\r\nimmediately arrested two or three of the Parali and, taking the vessel\r\nfrom the rest, shifted them into a troopship and set them to keep guard\r\nround Euboea. Chaereas, however, managed to secrete himself as soon as\r\nhe saw how things stood, and returning to Samos, drew a picture to the\r\nsoldiers of the horrors enacting at Athens, in which everything was\r\nexaggerated; saying that all were punished with stripes, that no one\r\ncould say a word against the holders of power, that the soldiers’ wives\r\nand children were outraged, and that it was intended to seize and shut\r\nup the relatives of all in the army at Samos who were not of the\r\ngovernment’s way of thinking, to be put to death in case of their\r\ndisobedience; besides a host of other injurious inventions.\r\n\r\nOn hearing this the first thought of the army was to fall upon the\r\nchief authors of the oligarchy and upon all the rest concerned.\r\nEventually, however, they desisted from this idea upon the men of\r\nmoderate views opposing it and warning them against ruining their\r\ncause, with the enemy close at hand and ready for battle. After this,\r\nThrasybulus, son of Lycus, and Thrasyllus, the chief leaders in the\r\nrevolution, now wishing in the most public manner to change the\r\ngovernment at Samos to a democracy, bound all the soldiers by the most\r\ntremendous oaths, and those of the oligarchical party more than any, to\r\naccept a democratic government, to be united, to prosecute actively the\r\nwar with the Peloponnesians, and to be enemies of the Four Hundred, and\r\nto hold no communication with them. The same oath was also taken by all\r\nthe Samians of full age; and the soldiers associated the Samians in all\r\ntheir affairs and in the fruits of their dangers, having the conviction\r\nthat there was no way of escape for themselves or for them, but that\r\nthe success of the Four Hundred or of the enemy at Miletus must be\r\ntheir ruin.\r\n\r\nThe struggle now was between the army trying to force a democracy upon\r\nthe city, and the Four Hundred an oligarchy upon the camp. Meanwhile\r\nthe soldiers forthwith held an assembly, in which they deposed the\r\nformer generals and any of the captains whom they suspected, and chose\r\nnew captains and generals to replace them, besides Thrasybulus and\r\nThrasyllus, whom they had already. They also stood up and encouraged\r\none another, and among other things urged that they ought not to lose\r\nheart because the city had revolted from them, as the party seceding\r\nwas smaller and in every way poorer in resources than themselves. They\r\nhad the whole fleet with which to compel the other cities in their\r\nempire to give them money just as if they had their base in the\r\ncapital, having a city in Samos which, so far from wanting strength,\r\nhad when at war been within an ace of depriving the Athenians of the\r\ncommand of the sea, while as far as the enemy was concerned they had\r\nthe same base of operations as before. Indeed, with the fleet in their\r\nhands, they were better able to provide themselves with supplies than\r\nthe government at home. It was their advanced position at Samos which\r\nhad throughout enabled the home authorities to command the entrance\r\ninto Piraeus; and if they refused to give them back the constitution,\r\nthey would now find that the army was more in a position to exclude\r\nthem from the sea than they were to exclude the army. Besides, the city\r\nwas of little or no use towards enabling them to overcome the enemy;\r\nand they had lost nothing in losing those who had no longer either\r\nmoney to send them (the soldiers having to find this for themselves),\r\nor good counsel, which entitles cities to direct armies. On the\r\ncontrary, even in this the home government had done wrong in abolishing\r\nthe institutions of their ancestors, while the army maintained the said\r\ninstitutions, and would try to force the home government to do so\r\nlikewise. So that even in point of good counsel the camp had as good\r\ncounsellors as the city. Moreover, they had but to grant him security\r\nfor his person and his recall, and Alcibiades would be only too glad to\r\nprocure them the alliance of the King. And above all if they failed\r\naltogether, with the navy which they possessed, they had numbers of\r\nplaces to retire to in which they would find cities and lands.\r\n\r\nDebating together and comforting themselves after this manner, they\r\npushed on their war measures as actively as ever; and the ten envoys\r\nsent to Samos by the Four Hundred, learning how matters stood while\r\nthey were still at Delos, stayed quiet there.\r\n\r\nAbout this time a cry arose a Peloponnesian fleet at Miletus that\r\nAstyochus and Tissaphernes were ruining their cause. Astyochus had not\r\nbeen willing to fight at sea—either before, while they were still in\r\nfull vigour and the fleet of the Athenians small, or now, when the\r\nenemy was, as they were informed, in a state of sedition and his ships\r\nnot yet united—but kept them waiting for the Phoenician fleet from\r\nTissaphernes, which had only a nominal existence, at the risk of\r\nwasting away in inactivity. While Tissaphernes not only did not bring\r\nup the fleet in question, but was ruining their navy by payments made\r\nirregularly, and even then not made in full. They must therefore, they\r\ninsisted, delay no longer, but fight a decisive naval engagement. The\r\nSyracusans were the most urgent of any.\r\n\r\nThe confederates and Astyochus, aware of these murmurs, had already\r\ndecided in council to fight a decisive battle; and when the news\r\nreached them of the disturbance at Samos, they put to sea with all\r\ntheir ships, one hundred and ten in number, and, ordering the Milesians\r\nto move by land upon Mycale, set sail thither. The Athenians with the\r\neighty-two ships from Samos were at the moment lying at Glauce in\r\nMycale, a point where Samos approaches near to the continent; and,\r\nseeing the Peloponnesian fleet sailing against them, retired into\r\nSamos, not thinking themselves numerically strong enough to stake their\r\nall upon a battle. Besides, they had notice from Miletus of the wish of\r\nthe enemy to engage, and were expecting to be joined from the\r\nHellespont by Strombichides, to whom a messenger had been already\r\ndispatched, with the ships that had gone from Chios to Abydos. The\r\nAthenians accordingly withdrew to Samos, and the Peloponnesians put in\r\nat Mycale, and encamped with the land forces of the Milesians and the\r\npeople of the neighbourhood. The next day they were about to sail\r\nagainst Samos, when tidings reached them of the arrival of\r\nStrombichides with the squadron from the Hellespont, upon which they\r\nimmediately sailed back to Miletus. The Athenians, thus reinforced, now\r\nin their turn sailed against Miletus with a hundred and eight ships,\r\nwishing to fight a decisive battle, but, as no one put out to meet\r\nthem, sailed back to Samos.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI\r\n\r\n\r\nTwenty-first Year of the War—Recall of Alcibiades to Samos—Revolt of\r\nEuboea and Downfall of the Four Hundred—Battle of Cynossema\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the same summer, immediately after this, the Peloponnesians having\r\nrefused to fight with their fleet united, through not thinking\r\nthemselves a match for the enemy, and being at a loss where to look for\r\nmoney for such a number of ships, especially as Tissaphernes proved so\r\nbad a paymaster, sent off Clearchus, son of Ramphias, with forty ships\r\nto Pharnabazus, agreeably to the original instructions from\r\nPeloponnese; Pharnabazus inviting them and being prepared to furnish\r\npay, and Byzantium besides sending offers to revolt to them. These\r\nPeloponnesian ships accordingly put out into the open sea, in order to\r\nescape the observation of the Athenians, and being overtaken by a\r\nstorm, the majority with Clearchus got into Delos, and afterwards\r\nreturned to Miletus, whence Clearchus proceeded by land to the\r\nHellespont to take the command: ten, however, of their number, under\r\nthe Megarian Helixus, made good their passage to the Hellespont, and\r\neffected the revolt of Byzantium. After this, the commanders at Samos\r\nwere informed of it, and sent a squadron against them to guard the\r\nHellespont; and an encounter took place before Byzantium between eight\r\nvessels on either side.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the chiefs at Samos, and especially Thrasybulus, who from the\r\nmoment that he had changed the government had remained firmly resolved\r\nto recall Alcibiades, at last in an assembly brought over the mass of\r\nthe soldiery, and upon their voting for his recall and amnesty, sailed\r\nover to Tissaphernes and brought Alcibiades to Samos, being convinced\r\nthat their only chance of salvation lay in his bringing over\r\nTissaphernes from the Peloponnesians to themselves. An assembly was\r\nthen held in which Alcibiades complained of and deplored his private\r\nmisfortune in having been banished, and speaking at great length upon\r\npublic affairs, highly incited their hopes for the future, and\r\nextravagantly magnified his own influence with Tissaphernes. His object\r\nin this was to make the oligarchical government at Athens afraid of\r\nhim, to hasten the dissolution of the clubs, to increase his credit\r\nwith the army at Samos and heighten their own confidence, and lastly to\r\nprejudice the enemy as strongly as possible against Tissaphernes, and\r\nblast the hopes which they entertained. Alcibiades accordingly held out\r\nto the army such extravagant promises as the following: that\r\nTissaphernes had solemnly assured him that if he could only trust the\r\nAthenians they should never want for supplies while he had anything\r\nleft, no, not even if he should have to coin his own silver couch, and\r\nthat he would bring the Phoenician fleet now at Aspendus to the\r\nAthenians instead of to the Peloponnesians; but that he could only\r\ntrust the Athenians if Alcibiades were recalled to be his security for\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nUpon hearing this and much more besides, the Athenians at once elected\r\nhim general together with the former ones, and put all their affairs\r\ninto his hands. There was now not a man in the army who would have\r\nexchanged his present hopes of safety and vengeance upon the Four\r\nHundred for any consideration whatever; and after what they had been\r\ntold they were now inclined to disdain the enemy before them, and to\r\nsail at once for Piraeus. To the plan of sailing for Piraeus, leaving\r\ntheir more immediate enemies behind them, Alcibiades opposed the most\r\npositive refusal, in spite of the numbers that insisted upon it, saying\r\nthat now that he had been elected general he would first sail to\r\nTissaphernes and concert with him measures for carrying on the war.\r\nAccordingly, upon leaving this assembly, he immediately took his\r\ndeparture in order to have it thought that there was an entire\r\nconfidence between them, and also wishing to increase his consideration\r\nwith Tissaphernes, and to show that he had now been elected general and\r\nwas in a position to do him good or evil as he chose; thus managing to\r\nfrighten the Athenians with Tissaphernes and Tissaphernes with the\r\nAthenians.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Peloponnesians at Miletus heard of the recall of\r\nAlcibiades and, already distrustful of Tissaphernes, now became far\r\nmore disgusted with him than ever. Indeed after their refusal to go out\r\nand give battle to the Athenians when they appeared before Miletus,\r\nTissaphernes had grown slacker than ever in his payments; and even\r\nbefore this, on account of Alcibiades, his unpopularity had been on the\r\nincrease. Gathering together, just as before, the soldiers and some\r\npersons of consideration besides the soldiery began to reckon up how\r\nthey had never yet received their pay in full; that what they did\r\nreceive was small in quantity, and even that paid irregularly, and that\r\nunless they fought a decisive battle or removed to some station where\r\nthey could get supplies, the ships’ crews would desert; and that it was\r\nall the fault of Astyochus, who humoured Tissaphernes for his own\r\nprivate advantage.\r\n\r\nThe army was engaged in these reflections, when the following\r\ndisturbance took place about the person of Astyochus. Most of the\r\nSyracusan and Thurian sailors were freemen, and these the freest crews\r\nin the armament were likewise the boldest in setting upon Astyochus and\r\ndemanding their pay. The latter answered somewhat stiffly and\r\nthreatened them, and when Dorieus spoke up for his own sailors even\r\nwent so far as to lift his baton against him; upon seeing which the\r\nmass of men, in sailor fashion, rushed in a fury to strike Astyochus.\r\nHe, however, saw them in time and fled for refuge to an altar; and they\r\nwere thus parted without his being struck. Meanwhile the fort built by\r\nTissaphernes in Miletus was surprised and taken by the Milesians, and\r\nthe garrison in it turned out—an act which met with the approval of the\r\nrest of the allies, and in particular of the Syracusans, but which\r\nfound no favour with Lichas, who said moreover that the Milesians and\r\nthe rest in the King’s country ought to show a reasonable submission to\r\nTissaphernes and to pay him court, until the war should be happily\r\nsettled. The Milesians were angry with him for this and for other\r\nthings of the kind, and upon his afterwards dying of sickness, would\r\nnot allow him to be buried where the Lacedaemonians with the army\r\ndesired.\r\n\r\nThe discontent of the army with Astyochus and Tissaphernes had reached\r\nthis pitch, when Mindarus arrived from Lacedaemon to succeed Astyochus\r\nas admiral, and assumed the command. Astyochus now set sail for home;\r\nand Tissaphernes sent with him one of his confidants, Gaulites, a\r\nCarian, who spoke the two languages, to complain of the Milesians for\r\nthe affair of the fort, and at the same time to defend himself against\r\nthe Milesians, who were, as he was aware, on their way to Sparta\r\nchiefly to denounce his conduct, and had with them Hermocrates, who was\r\nto accuse Tissaphernes of joining with Alcibiades to ruin the\r\nPeloponnesian cause and of playing a double game. Indeed Hermocrates\r\nhad always been at enmity with him about the pay not being restored in\r\nfull; and eventually when he was banished from Syracuse, and new\r\ncommanders—Potamis, Myscon, and Demarchus—had come out to Miletus to\r\nthe ships of the Syracusans, Tissaphernes, pressed harder than ever\r\nupon him in his exile, and among other charges against him accused him\r\nof having once asked him for money, and then given himself out as his\r\nenemy because he failed to obtain it.\r\n\r\nWhile Astyochus and the Milesians and Hermocrates made sail for\r\nLacedaemon, Alcibiades had now crossed back from Tissaphernes to Samos.\r\nAfter his return the envoys of the Four Hundred sent, as has been\r\nmentioned above, to pacify and explain matters to the forces at Samos,\r\narrived from Delos; and an assembly was held in which they attempted to\r\nspeak. The soldiers at first would not hear them, and cried out to put\r\nto death the subverters of the democracy, but at last, after some\r\ndifficulty, calmed down and gave them a hearing. Upon this the envoys\r\nproceeded to inform them that the recent change had been made to save\r\nthe city, and not to ruin it or to deliver it over to the enemy, for\r\nthey had already had an opportunity of doing this when he invaded the\r\ncountry during their government; that all the Five Thousand would have\r\ntheir proper share in the government; and that their hearers’ relatives\r\nhad neither outrage, as Chaereas had slanderously reported, nor other\r\nill treatment to complain of, but were all in undisturbed enjoyment of\r\ntheir property just as they had left them. Besides these they made a\r\nnumber of other statements which had no better success with their angry\r\nauditors; and amid a host of different opinions the one which found\r\nmost favour was that of sailing to Piraeus. Now it was that Alcibiades\r\nfor the first time did the state a service, and one of the most signal\r\nkind. For when the Athenians at Samos were bent upon sailing against\r\ntheir countrymen, in which case Ionia and the Hellespont would most\r\ncertainly at once have passed into possession of the enemy, Alcibiades\r\nit was who prevented them. At that moment, when no other man would have\r\nbeen able to hold back the multitude, he put a stop to the intended\r\nexpedition, and rebuked and turned aside the resentment felt, on\r\npersonal grounds, against the envoys; he dismissed them with an answer\r\nfrom himself, to the effect that he did not object to the government of\r\nthe Five Thousand, but insisted that the Four Hundred should be deposed\r\nand the Council of Five Hundred reinstated in power: meanwhile any\r\nretrenchments for economy, by which pay might be better found for the\r\narmament, met with his entire approval. Generally, he bade them hold\r\nout and show a bold face to the enemy, since if the city were saved\r\nthere was good hope that the two parties might some day be reconciled,\r\nwhereas if either were once destroyed, that at Samos, or that at\r\nAthens, there would no longer be any one to be reconciled to. Meanwhile\r\narrived envoys from the Argives, with offers of support to the Athenian\r\ncommons at Samos: these were thanked by Alcibiades, and dismissed with\r\na request to come when called upon. The Argives were accompanied by the\r\ncrew of the Paralus, whom we left placed in a troopship by the Four\r\nHundred with orders to cruise round Euboea, and who being employed to\r\ncarry to Lacedaemon some Athenian envoys sent by the Four\r\nHundred—Laespodias, Aristophon, and Melesias—as they sailed by Argos\r\nlaid hands upon the envoys, and delivering them over to the Argives as\r\nthe chief subverters of the democracy, themselves, instead of returning\r\nto Athens, took the Argive envoys on board, and came to Samos in the\r\ngalley which had been confided to them.\r\n\r\nThe same summer at the time that the return of Alcibiades coupled with\r\nthe general conduct of Tissaphernes had carried to its height the\r\ndiscontent of the Peloponnesians, who no longer entertained any doubt\r\nof his having joined the Athenians, Tissaphernes wishing, it would\r\nseem, to clear himself to them of these charges, prepared to go after\r\nthe Phoenician fleet to Aspendus, and invited Lichas to go with him;\r\nsaying that he would appoint Tamos as his lieutenant to provide pay for\r\nthe armament during his own absence. Accounts differ, and it is not\r\neasy to ascertain with what intention he went to Aspendus, and did not\r\nbring the fleet after all. That one hundred and forty-seven Phoenician\r\nships came as far as Aspendus is certain; but why they did not come on\r\nhas been variously accounted for. Some think that he went away in\r\npursuance of his plan of wasting the Peloponnesian resources, since at\r\nany rate Tamos, his lieutenant, far from being any better, proved a\r\nworse paymaster than himself: others that he brought the Phoenicians to\r\nAspendus to exact money from them for their discharge, having never\r\nintended to employ them: others again that it was in view of the outcry\r\nagainst him at Lacedaemon, in order that it might be said that he was\r\nnot in fault, but that the ships were really manned and that he had\r\ncertainly gone to fetch them. To myself it seems only too evident that\r\nhe did not bring up the fleet because he wished to wear out and\r\nparalyse the Hellenic forces, that is, to waste their strength by the\r\ntime lost during his journey to Aspendus, and to keep them evenly\r\nbalanced by not throwing his weight into either scale. Had he wished to\r\nfinish the war, he could have done so, assuming of course that he made\r\nhis appearance in a way which left no room for doubt; as by bringing up\r\nthe fleet he would in all probability have given the victory to the\r\nLacedaemonians, whose navy, even as it was, faced the Athenian more as\r\nan equal than as an inferior. But what convicts him most clearly, is\r\nthe excuse which he put forward for not bringing the ships. He said\r\nthat the number assembled was less than the King had ordered; but\r\nsurely it would only have enhanced his credit if he spent little of the\r\nKing’s money and effected the same end at less cost. In any case,\r\nwhatever was his intention, Tissaphernes went to Aspendus and saw the\r\nPhoenicians; and the Peloponnesians at his desire sent a Lacedaemonian\r\ncalled Philip with two galleys to fetch the fleet.\r\n\r\nAlcibiades finding that Tissaphernes had gone to Aspendus, himself\r\nsailed thither with thirteen ships, promising to do a great and certain\r\nservice to the Athenians at Samos, as he would either bring the\r\nPhoenician fleet to the Athenians, or at all events prevent its joining\r\nthe Peloponnesians. In all probability he had long known that\r\nTissaphernes never meant to bring the fleet at all, and wished to\r\ncompromise him as much as possible in the eyes of the Peloponnesians\r\nthrough his apparent friendship for himself and the Athenians, and thus\r\nin a manner to oblige him to join their side.\r\n\r\nWhile Alcibiades weighed anchor and sailed eastward straight for\r\nPhaselis and Caunus, the envoys sent by the Four Hundred to Samos\r\narrived at Athens. Upon their delivering the message from Alcibiades,\r\ntelling them to hold out and to show a firm front to the enemy, and\r\nsaying that he had great hopes of reconciling them with the army and of\r\novercoming the Peloponnesians, the majority of the members of the\r\noligarchy, who were already discontented and only too much inclined to\r\nbe quit of the business in any safe way that they could, were at once\r\ngreatly strengthened in their resolve. These now banded together and\r\nstrongly criticized the administration, their leaders being some of the\r\nprincipal generals and men in office under the oligarchy, such as\r\nTheramenes, son of Hagnon, Aristocrates, son of Scellias, and others;\r\nwho, although among the most prominent members of the government (being\r\nafraid, as they said, of the army at Samos, and most especially of\r\nAlcibiades, and also lest the envoys whom they had sent to Lacedaemon\r\nmight do the state some harm without the authority of the people),\r\nwithout insisting on objections to the excessive concentration of power\r\nin a few hands, yet urged that the Five Thousand must be shown to exist\r\nnot merely in name but in reality, and the constitution placed upon a\r\nfairer basis. But this was merely their political cry; most of them\r\nbeing driven by private ambition into the line of conduct so surely\r\nfatal to oligarchies that arise out of democracies. For all at once\r\npretend to be not only equals but each the chief and master of his\r\nfellows; while under a democracy a disappointed candidate accepts his\r\ndefeat more easily, because he has not the humiliation of being beaten\r\nby his equals. But what most clearly encouraged the malcontents was the\r\npower of Alcibiades at Samos, and their own disbelief in the stability\r\nof the oligarchy; and it was now a race between them as to which should\r\nfirst become the leader of the commons.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the leaders and members of the Four Hundred most opposed to a\r\ndemocratic form of government—Phrynichus who had had the quarrel with\r\nAlcibiades during his command at Samos, Aristarchus the bitter and\r\ninveterate enemy of the commons, and Pisander and Antiphon and others\r\nof the chiefs who already as soon as they entered upon power, and again\r\nwhen the army at Samos seceded from them and declared for a democracy,\r\nhad sent envoys from their own body to Lacedaemon and made every effort\r\nfor peace, and had built the wall in Eetionia—now redoubled their\r\nexertions when their envoys returned from Samos, and they saw not only\r\nthe people but their own most trusted associates turning against them.\r\nAlarmed at the state of things at Athens as at Samos, they now sent off\r\nin haste Antiphon and Phrynichus and ten others with injunctions to\r\nmake peace with Lacedaemon upon any terms, no matter what, that should\r\nbe at all tolerable. Meanwhile they pushed on more actively than ever\r\nwith the wall in Eetionia. Now the meaning of this wall, according to\r\nTheramenes and his supporters, was not so much to keep out the army of\r\nSamos, in case of its trying to force its way into Piraeus, as to be\r\nable to let in, at pleasure, the fleet and army of the enemy. For\r\nEetionia is a mole of Piraeus, close alongside of the entrance of the\r\nharbour, and was now fortified in connection with the wall already\r\nexisting on the land side, so that a few men placed in it might be able\r\nto command the entrance; the old wall on the land side and the new one\r\nnow being built within on the side of the sea, both ending in one of\r\nthe two towers standing at the narrow mouth of the harbour. They also\r\nwalled off the largest porch in Piraeus which was in immediate\r\nconnection with this wall, and kept it in their own hands, compelling\r\nall to unload there the corn that came into the harbour, and what they\r\nhad in stock, and to take it out from thence when they sold it.\r\n\r\nThese measures had long provoked the murmurs of Theramenes, and when\r\nthe envoys returned from Lacedaemon without having effected any general\r\npacification, he affirmed that this wall was like to prove the ruin of\r\nthe state. At this moment forty-two ships from Peloponnese, including\r\nsome Siceliot and Italiot vessels from Locri and Tarentum, had been\r\ninvited over by the Euboeans and were already riding off Las in Laconia\r\npreparing for the voyage to Euboea, under the command of Agesandridas,\r\nson of Agesander, a Spartan. Theramenes now affirmed that this squadron\r\nwas destined not so much to aid Euboea as the party fortifying\r\nEetionia, and that unless precautions were speedily taken the city\r\nwould be surprised and lost. This was no mere calumny, there being\r\nreally some such plan entertained by the accused. Their first wish was\r\nto have the oligarchy without giving up the empire; failing this to\r\nkeep their ships and walls and be independent; while, if this also were\r\ndenied them, sooner than be the first victims of the restored\r\ndemocracy, they were resolved to call in the enemy and make peace, give\r\nup their walls and ships, and at all costs retain possession of the\r\ngovernment, if their lives were only assured to them.\r\n\r\nFor this reason they pushed forward the construction of their work with\r\nposterns and entrances and means of introducing the enemy, being eager\r\nto have it finished in time. Meanwhile the murmurs against them were at\r\nfirst confined to a few persons and went on in secret, until\r\nPhrynichus, after his return from the embassy to Lacedaemon, was laid\r\nwait for and stabbed in full market by one of the Peripoli, falling\r\ndown dead before he had gone far from the council chamber. The assassin\r\nescaped; but his accomplice, an Argive, was taken and put to the\r\ntorture by the Four Hundred, without their being able to extract from\r\nhim the name of his employer, or anything further than that he knew of\r\nmany men who used to assemble at the house of the commander of the\r\nPeripoli and at other houses. Here the matter was allowed to drop. This\r\nso emboldened Theramenes and Aristocrates and the rest of their\r\npartisans in the Four Hundred and out of doors, that they now resolved\r\nto act. For by this time the ships had sailed round from Las, and\r\nanchoring at Epidaurus had overrun Aegina; and Theramenes asserted\r\nthat, being bound for Euboea, they would never have sailed in to Aegina\r\nand come back to anchor at Epidaurus, unless they had been invited to\r\ncome to aid in the designs of which he had always accused the\r\ngovernment. Further inaction had therefore now become impossible. In\r\nthe end, after a great many seditious harangues and suspicions, they\r\nset to work in real earnest. The heavy infantry in Piraeus building the\r\nwall in Eetionia, among whom was Aristocrates, a colonel, with his own\r\ntribe, laid hands upon Alexicles, a general under the oligarchy and the\r\ndevoted adherent of the cabal, and took him into a house and confined\r\nhim there. In this they were assisted by one Hermon, commander of the\r\nPeripoli in Munychia, and others, and above all had with them the great\r\nbulk of the heavy infantry. As soon as the news reached the Four\r\nHundred, who happened to be sitting in the council chamber, all except\r\nthe disaffected wished at once to go to the posts where the arms were,\r\nand menaced Theramenes and his party. Theramenes defended himself, and\r\nsaid that he was ready immediately to go and help to rescue Alexicles;\r\nand taking with him one of the generals belonging to his party, went\r\ndown to Piraeus, followed by Aristarchus and some young men of the\r\ncavalry. All was now panic and confusion. Those in the city imagined\r\nthat Piraeus was already taken and the prisoner put to death, while\r\nthose in Piraeus expected every moment to be attacked by the party in\r\nthe city. The older men, however, stopped the persons running up and\r\ndown the town and making for the stands of arms; and Thucydides the\r\nPharsalian, proxenus of the city, came forward and threw himself in the\r\nway of the rival factions, and appealed to them not to ruin the state,\r\nwhile the enemy was still at hand waiting for his opportunity, and so\r\nat length succeeded in quieting them and in keeping their hands off\r\neach other. Meanwhile Theramenes came down to Piraeus, being himself\r\none of the generals, and raged and stormed against the heavy infantry,\r\nwhile Aristarchus and the adversaries of the people were angry in right\r\nearnest. Most of the heavy infantry, however, went on with the business\r\nwithout faltering, and asked Theramenes if he thought the wall had been\r\nconstructed for any good purpose, and whether it would not be better\r\nthat it should be pulled down. To this he answered that if they thought\r\nit best to pull it down, he for his part agreed with them. Upon this\r\nthe heavy infantry and a number of the people in Piraeus immediately\r\ngot up on the fortification and began to demolish it. Now their cry to\r\nthe multitude was that all should join in the work who wished the Five\r\nThousand to govern instead of the Four Hundred. For instead of saying\r\nin so many words “all who wished the commons to govern,” they still\r\ndisguised themselves under the name of the Five Thousand; being afraid\r\nthat these might really exist, and that they might be speaking to one\r\nof their number and get into trouble through ignorance. Indeed this was\r\nwhy the Four Hundred neither wished the Five Thousand to exist, nor to\r\nhave it known that they did not exist; being of opinion that to give\r\nthemselves so many partners in empire would be downright democracy,\r\nwhile the mystery in question would make the people afraid of one\r\nanother.\r\n\r\nThe next day the Four Hundred, although alarmed, nevertheless assembled\r\nin the council chamber, while the heavy infantry in Piraeus, after\r\nhaving released their prisoner Alexicles and pulled down the\r\nfortification, went with their arms to the theatre of Dionysus, close\r\nto Munychia, and there held an assembly in which they decided to march\r\ninto the city, and setting forth accordingly halted in the Anaceum.\r\nHere they were joined by some delegates from the Four Hundred, who\r\nreasoned with them one by one, and persuaded those whom they saw to be\r\nthe most moderate to remain quiet themselves, and to keep in the rest;\r\nsaying that they would make known the Five Thousand, and have the Four\r\nHundred chosen from them in rotation, as should be decided by the Five\r\nThousand, and meanwhile entreated them not to ruin the state or drive\r\nit into the arms of the enemy. After a great many had spoken and had\r\nbeen spoken to, the whole body of heavy infantry became calmer than\r\nbefore, absorbed by their fears for the country at large, and now\r\nagreed to hold upon an appointed day an assembly in the theatre of\r\nDionysus for the restoration of concord.\r\n\r\nWhen the day came for the assembly in the theatre, and they were upon\r\nthe point of assembling, news arrived that the forty-two ships under\r\nAgesandridas were sailing from Megara along the coast of Salamis. The\r\npeople to a man now thought that it was just what Theramenes and his\r\nparty had so often said, that the ships were sailing to the\r\nfortification, and concluded that they had done well to demolish it.\r\nBut though it may possibly have been by appointment that Agesandridas\r\nhovered about Epidaurus and the neighbourhood, he would also naturally\r\nbe kept there by the hope of an opportunity arising out of the troubles\r\nin the town. In any case the Athenians, on receipt of the news\r\nimmediately ran down in mass to Piraeus, seeing themselves threatened\r\nby the enemy with a worse war than their war among themselves, not at a\r\ndistance, but close to the harbour of Athens. Some went on board the\r\nships already afloat, while others launched fresh vessels, or ran to\r\ndefend the walls and the mouth of the harbour.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Peloponnesian vessels sailed by, and rounding Sunium\r\nanchored between Thoricus and Prasiae, and afterwards arrived at\r\nOropus. The Athenians, with revolution in the city, and unwilling to\r\nlose a moment in going to the relief of their most important possession\r\n(for Euboea was everything to them now that they were shut out from\r\nAttica), were compelled to put to sea in haste and with untrained\r\ncrews, and sent Thymochares with some vessels to Eretria. These upon\r\ntheir arrival, with the ships already in Euboea, made up a total of\r\nthirty-six vessels, and were immediately forced to engage. For\r\nAgesandridas, after his crews had dined, put out from Oropus, which is\r\nabout seven miles from Eretria by sea; and the Athenians, seeing him\r\nsailing up, immediately began to man their vessels. The sailors,\r\nhowever, instead of being by their ships, as they supposed, were gone\r\naway to purchase provisions for their dinner in the houses in the\r\noutskirts of the town; the Eretrians having so arranged that there\r\nshould be nothing on sale in the marketplace, in order that the\r\nAthenians might be a long time in manning their ships, and, the enemy’s\r\nattack taking them by surprise, might be compelled to put to sea just\r\nas they were. A signal also was raised in Eretria to give them notice\r\nin Oropus when to put to sea. The Athenians, forced to put out so\r\npoorly prepared, engaged off the harbour of Eretria, and after holding\r\ntheir own for some little while notwithstanding, were at length put to\r\nflight and chased to the shore. Such of their number as took refuge in\r\nEretria, which they presumed to be friendly to them, found their fate\r\nin that city, being butchered by the inhabitants; while those who fled\r\nto the Athenian fort in the Eretrian territory, and the vessels which\r\ngot to Chalcis, were saved. The Peloponnesians, after taking twenty-two\r\nAthenian ships, and killing or making prisoners of the crews, set up a\r\ntrophy, and not long afterwards effected the revolt of the whole of\r\nEuboea (except Oreus, which was held by the Athenians themselves), and\r\nmade a general settlement of the affairs of the island.\r\n\r\nWhen the news of what had happened in Euboea reached Athens, a panic\r\nensued such as they had never before known. Neither the disaster in\r\nSicily, great as it seemed at the time, nor any other had ever so much\r\nalarmed them. The camp at Samos was in revolt; they had no more ships\r\nor men to man them; they were at discord among themselves and might at\r\nany moment come to blows; and a disaster of this magnitude coming on\r\nthe top of all, by which they lost their fleet, and worst of all\r\nEuboea, which was of more value to them than Attica, could not occur\r\nwithout throwing them into the deepest despondency. Meanwhile their\r\ngreatest and most immediate trouble was the possibility that the enemy,\r\nemboldened by his victory, might make straight for them and sail\r\nagainst Piraeus, which they had no longer ships to defend; and every\r\nmoment they expected him to arrive. This, with a little more courage,\r\nhe might easily have done, in which case he would either have increased\r\nthe dissensions of the city by his presence, or, if he had stayed to\r\nbesiege it, have compelled the fleet from Ionia, although the enemy of\r\nthe oligarchy, to come to the rescue of their country and of their\r\nrelatives, and in the meantime would have become master of the\r\nHellespont, Ionia, the islands, and of everything as far as Euboea, or,\r\nto speak roundly, of the whole Athenian empire. But here, as on so many\r\nother occasions, the Lacedaemonians proved the most convenient people\r\nin the world for the Athenians to be at war with. The wide difference\r\nbetween the two characters, the slowness and want of energy of the\r\nLacedaemonians as contrasted with the dash and enterprise of their\r\nopponents, proved of the greatest service, especially to a maritime\r\nempire like Athens. Indeed this was shown by the Syracusans, who were\r\nmost like the Athenians in character, and also most successful in\r\ncombating them.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, upon receipt of the news, the Athenians manned twenty\r\nships and called immediately a first assembly in the Pnyx, where they\r\nhad been used to meet formerly, and deposed the Four Hundred and voted\r\nto hand over the government to the Five Thousand, of which body all who\r\nfurnished a suit of armour were to be members, decreeing also that no\r\none should receive pay for the discharge of any office, or if he did\r\nshould be held accursed. Many other assemblies were held afterwards, in\r\nwhich law-makers were elected and all other measures taken to form a\r\nconstitution. It was during the first period of this constitution that\r\nthe Athenians appear to have enjoyed the best government that they ever\r\ndid, at least in my time. For the fusion of the high and the low was\r\neffected with judgment, and this was what first enabled the state to\r\nraise up her head after her manifold disasters. They also voted for the\r\nrecall of Alcibiades and of other exiles, and sent to him and to the\r\ncamp at Samos, and urged them to devote themselves vigorously to the\r\nwar.\r\n\r\nUpon this revolution taking place, the party of Pisander and Alexicles\r\nand the chiefs of the oligarchs immediately withdrew to Decelea, with\r\nthe single exception of Aristarchus, one of the generals, who hastily\r\ntook some of the most barbarian of the archers and marched to Oenoe.\r\nThis was a fort of the Athenians upon the Boeotian border, at that\r\nmoment besieged by the Corinthians, irritated by the loss of a party\r\nreturning from Decelea, who had been cut off by the garrison. The\r\nCorinthians had volunteered for this service, and had called upon the\r\nBoeotians to assist them. After communicating with them, Aristarchus\r\ndeceived the garrison in Oenoe by telling them that their countrymen in\r\nthe city had compounded with the Lacedaemonians, and that one of the\r\nterms of the capitulation was that they must surrender the place to the\r\nBoeotians. The garrison believed him as he was general, and besides\r\nknew nothing of what had occurred owing to the siege, and so evacuated\r\nthe fort under truce. In this way the Boeotians gained possession of\r\nOenoe, and the oligarchy and the troubles at Athens ended.\r\n\r\nTo return to the Peloponnesians in Miletus. No pay was forthcoming from\r\nany of the agents deputed by Tissaphernes for that purpose upon his\r\ndeparture for Aspendus; neither the Phoenician fleet nor Tissaphernes\r\nshowed any signs of appearing, and Philip, who had been sent with him,\r\nand another Spartan, Hippocrates, who was at Phaselis, wrote word to\r\nMindarus, the admiral, that the ships were not coming at all, and that\r\nthey were being grossly abused by Tissaphernes. Meanwhile Pharnabazus\r\nwas inviting them to come, and making every effort to get the fleet\r\nand, like Tissaphernes, to cause the revolt of the cities in his\r\ngovernment still subject to Athens, founding great hopes on his\r\nsuccess; until at length, at about the period of the summer which we\r\nhave now reached, Mindarus yielded to his importunities, and, with\r\ngreat order and at a moment’s notice, in order to elude the enemy at\r\nSamos, weighed anchor with seventy-three ships from Miletus and set\r\nsail for the Hellespont. Thither sixteen vessels had already preceded\r\nhim in the same summer, and had overrun part of the Chersonese. Being\r\ncaught in a storm, Mindarus was compelled to run in to Icarus and,\r\nafter being detained five or six days there by stress of weather,\r\narrived at Chios.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile Thrasyllus had heard of his having put out from Miletus, and\r\nimmediately set sail with fifty-five ships from Samos, in haste to\r\narrive before him in the Hellespont. But learning that he was at Chios,\r\nand expecting that he would stay there, he posted scouts in Lesbos and\r\non the continent opposite to prevent the fleet moving without his\r\nknowing it, and himself coasted along to Methymna, and gave orders to\r\nprepare meal and other necessaries, in order to attack them from Lesbos\r\nin the event of their remaining for any length of time at Chios.\r\nMeanwhile he resolved to sail against Eresus, a town in Lesbos which\r\nhad revolted, and, if he could, to take it. For some of the principal\r\nMethymnian exiles had carried over about fifty heavy infantry, their\r\nsworn associates, from Cuma, and hiring others from the continent, so\r\nas to make up three hundred in all, chose Anaxander, a Theban, to\r\ncommand them, on account of the community of blood existing between the\r\nThebans and the Lesbians, and first attacked Methymna. Balked in this\r\nattempt by the advance of the Athenian guards from Mitylene, and\r\nrepulsed a second time in a battle outside the city, they then crossed\r\nthe mountain and effected the revolt of Eresus. Thrasyllus accordingly\r\ndetermined to go there with all his ships and to attack the place.\r\nMeanwhile Thrasybulus had preceded him thither with five ships from\r\nSamos, as soon as he heard that the exiles had crossed over, and coming\r\ntoo late to save Eresus, went on and anchored before the town. Here\r\nthey were joined also by two vessels on their way home from the\r\nHellespont, and by the ships of the Methymnians, making a grand total\r\nof sixty-seven vessels; and the forces on board now made ready with\r\nengines and every other means available to do their utmost to storm\r\nEresus.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime Mindarus and the Peloponnesian fleet at Chios, after\r\ntaking provisions for two days and receiving three Chian pieces of\r\nmoney for each man from the Chians, on the third day put out in haste\r\nfrom the island; in order to avoid falling in with the ships at Eresus,\r\nthey did not make for the open sea, but keeping Lesbos on their left,\r\nsailed for the continent. After touching at the port of Carteria, in\r\nthe Phocaeid, and dining, they went on along the Cumaean coast and\r\nsupped at Arginusae, on the continent over against Mitylene. From\r\nthence they continued their voyage along the coast, although it was\r\nlate in the night, and arriving at Harmatus on the continent opposite\r\nMethymna, dined there; and swiftly passing Lectum, Larisa, Hamaxitus,\r\nand the neighbouring towns, arrived a little before midnight at\r\nRhoeteum. Here they were now in the Hellespont. Some of the ships also\r\nput in at Sigeum and at other places in the neighbourhood.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the warnings of the fire signals and the sudden increase in\r\nthe number of fires on the enemy’s shore informed the eighteen Athenian\r\nships at Sestos of the approach of the Peloponnesian fleet. That very\r\nnight they set sail in haste just as they were, and, hugging the shore\r\nof the Chersonese, coasted along to Elaeus, in order to sail out into\r\nthe open sea away from the fleet of the enemy.\r\n\r\nAfter passing unobserved the sixteen ships at Abydos, which had\r\nnevertheless been warned by their approaching friends to be on the\r\nalert to prevent their sailing out, at dawn they sighted the fleet of\r\nMindarus, which immediately gave chase. All had not time to get away;\r\nthe greater number however escaped to Imbros and Lemnos, while four of\r\nthe hindmost were overtaken off Elaeus. One of these was stranded\r\nopposite to the temple of Protesilaus and taken with its crew, two\r\nothers without their crews; the fourth was abandoned on the shore of\r\nImbros and burned by the enemy.\r\n\r\nAfter this the Peloponnesians were joined by the squadron from Abydos,\r\nwhich made up their fleet to a grand total of eighty-six vessels; they\r\nspent the day in unsuccessfully besieging Elaeus, and then sailed back\r\nto Abydos. Meanwhile the Athenians, deceived by their scouts, and never\r\ndreaming of the enemy’s fleet getting by undetected, were tranquilly\r\nbesieging Eresus. As soon as they heard the news they instantly\r\nabandoned Eresus, and made with all speed for the Hellespont, and after\r\ntaking two of the Peloponnesian ships which had been carried out too\r\nfar into the open sea in the ardour of the pursuit and now fell in\r\ntheir way, the next day dropped anchor at Elaeus, and, bringing back\r\nthe ships that had taken refuge at Imbros, during five days prepared\r\nfor the coming engagement.\r\n\r\nAfter this they engaged in the following way. The Athenians formed in\r\ncolumn and sailed close alongshore to Sestos; upon perceiving which the\r\nPeloponnesians put out from Abydos to meet them. Realizing that a\r\nbattle was now imminent, both combatants extended their flank; the\r\nAthenians along the Chersonese from Idacus to Arrhiani with seventy-six\r\nships; the Peloponnesians from Abydos to Dardanus with eighty-six. The\r\nPeloponnesian right wing was occupied by the Syracusans, their left by\r\nMindarus in person with the best sailers in the navy; the Athenian left\r\nby Thrasyllus, their right by Thrasybulus, the other commanders being\r\nin different parts of the fleet. The Peloponnesians hastened to engage\r\nfirst, and outflanking with their left the Athenian right sought to cut\r\nthem off, if possible, from sailing out of the straits, and to drive\r\ntheir centre upon the shore, which was not far off. The Athenians\r\nperceiving their intention extended their own wing and outsailed them,\r\nwhile their left had by this time passed the point of Cynossema. This,\r\nhowever, obliged them to thin and weaken their centre, especially as\r\nthey had fewer ships than the enemy, and as the coast round Point\r\nCynossema formed a sharp angle which prevented their seeing what was\r\ngoing on on the other side of it.\r\n\r\nThe Peloponnesians now attacked their centre and drove ashore the ships\r\nof the Athenians, and disembarked to follow up their victory. No help\r\ncould be given to the centre either by the squadron of Thrasybulus on\r\nthe right, on account of the number of ships attacking him, or by that\r\nof Thrasyllus on the left, from whom the point of Cynossema hid what\r\nwas going on, and who was also hindered by his Syracusan and other\r\nopponents, whose numbers were fully equal to his own. At length,\r\nhowever, the Peloponnesians in the confidence of victory began to\r\nscatter in pursuit of the ships of the enemy, and allowed a\r\nconsiderable part of their fleet to get into disorder. On seeing this\r\nthe squadron of Thrasybulus discontinued their lateral movement and,\r\nfacing about, attacked and routed the ships opposed to them, and next\r\nfell roughly upon the scattered vessels of the victorious Peloponnesian\r\ndivision, and put most of them to flight without a blow. The Syracusans\r\nalso had by this time given way before the squadron of Thrasyllus, and\r\nnow openly took to flight upon seeing the flight of their comrades.\r\n\r\nThe rout was now complete. Most of the Peloponnesians fled for refuge\r\nfirst to the river Midius, and afterwards to Abydos. Only a few ships\r\nwere taken by the Athenians; as owing to the narrowness of the\r\nHellespont the enemy had not far to go to be in safety. Nevertheless\r\nnothing could have been more opportune for them than this victory. Up\r\nto this time they had feared the Peloponnesian fleet, owing to a number\r\nof petty losses and to the disaster in Sicily; but they now ceased to\r\nmistrust themselves or any longer to think their enemies good for\r\nanything at sea. Meanwhile they took from the enemy eight Chian\r\nvessels, five Corinthian, two Ambraciot, two Boeotian, one Leucadian,\r\nLacedaemonian, Syracusan, and Pellenian, losing fifteen of their own.\r\nAfter setting up a trophy upon Point Cynossema, securing the wrecks,\r\nand restoring to the enemy his dead under truce, they sent off a galley\r\nto Athens with the news of their victory. The arrival of this vessel\r\nwith its unhoped-for good news, after the recent disasters of Euboea,\r\nand in the revolution at Athens, gave fresh courage to the Athenians,\r\nand caused them to believe that if they put their shoulders to the\r\nwheel their cause might yet prevail.\r\n\r\nOn the fourth day after the sea-fight the Athenians in Sestos having\r\nhastily refitted their ships sailed against Cyzicus, which had\r\nrevolted. Off Harpagium and Priapus they sighted at anchor the eight\r\nvessels from Byzantium, and, sailing up and routing the troops on\r\nshore, took the ships, and then went on and recovered the town of\r\nCyzicus, which was unfortified, and levied money from the citizens. In\r\nthe meantime the Peloponnesians sailed from Abydos to Elaeus, and\r\nrecovered such of their captured galleys as were still uninjured, the\r\nrest having been burned by the Elaeusians, and sent Hippocrates and\r\nEpicles to Euboea to fetch the squadron from that island.\r\n\r\nAbout the same time Alcibiades returned with his thirteen ships from\r\nCaunus and Phaselis to Samos, bringing word that he had prevented the\r\nPhoenician fleet from joining the Peloponnesians, and had made\r\nTissaphernes more friendly to the Athenians than before. Alcibiades now\r\nmanned nine more ships, and levied large sums of money from the\r\nHalicarnassians, and fortified Cos. After doing this and placing a\r\ngovernor in Cos, he sailed back to Samos, autumn being now at hand.\r\nMeanwhile Tissaphernes, upon hearing that the Peloponnesian fleet had\r\nsailed from Miletus to the Hellespont, set off again back from\r\nAspendus, and made all sail for Ionia. While the Peloponnesians were in\r\nthe Hellespont, the Antandrians, a people of Aeolic extraction,\r\nconveyed by land across Mount Ida some heavy infantry from Abydos, and\r\nintroduced them into the town; having been ill-treated by Arsaces, the\r\nPersian lieutenant of Tissaphernes. This same Arsaces had, upon\r\npretence of a secret quarrel, invited the chief men of the Delians to\r\nundertake military service (these were Delians who had settled at\r\nAtramyttium after having been driven from their homes by the Athenians\r\nfor the sake of purifying Delos); and after drawing them out from their\r\ntown as his friends and allies, had laid wait for them at dinner, and\r\nsurrounded them and caused them to be shot down by his soldiers. This\r\ndeed made the Antandrians fear that he might some day do them some\r\nmischief; and as he also laid upon them burdens too heavy for them to\r\nbear, they expelled his garrison from their citadel.\r\n\r\nTissaphernes, upon hearing of this act of the Peloponnesians in\r\naddition to what had occurred at Miletus and Cnidus, where his\r\ngarrisons had been also expelled, now saw that the breach between them\r\nwas serious; and fearing further injury from them, and being also vexed\r\nto think that Pharnabazus should receive them, and in less time and at\r\nless cost perhaps succeed better against Athens than he had done,\r\ndetermined to rejoin them in the Hellespont, in order to complain of\r\nthe events at Antandros and excuse himself as best he could in the\r\nmatter of the Phoenician fleet and of the other charges against him.\r\nAccordingly he went first to Ephesus and offered sacrifice to\r\nArtemis....\r\n\r\n[When the winter after this summer is over the twenty-first year of\r\nthis war will be completed. ]\r\n\r\nTHE END",
