with\r\nthe history of the sea! Great voyages have not been organised for the mere\r\ndiscovery of so much salt water—except as a means to an end—and the good\r\nship has almost always sailed with a definite and positive mission. The\r\nhistory of but a single vessel involves the history, more or less, of\r\nhundreds of people; it may mean that of thousands. So the history of the\r\nocean is that also of lands and peoples, far off or near. Subjects the\r\nmost diverse are still intimately connected with it. In the space of a few\r\nyears’ time, war and peace are strangely contrasted; brilliant discoveries\r\nare succeeded by disastrous failures, and heroic deeds stand side by side\r\nwith shameless transactions. Take only a few of the succeeding pages, and\r\nwe shall find recorded in them the stories of the early colonisation of\r\nAmerica, and of the disastrous voyages in quest of the fabled El Dorado,\r\nfollowed by the brave and daring deeds of one of our greatest naval\r\nheroes; these again by the establishment of the great commercial company\r\nwhich once ruled India, succeeded by stories of pirates on the sea, and\r\n“bubble” promoters ashore. Sketches of maritime affairs must be “in black\r\nand white,” so great are the contrasts. But let us turn to our first\r\nsubject, the early voyages to, and colonisation of, the great New World.\r\n\r\nAbout one hundred men formed the first little colony landed in Virginia\r\nfrom the expedition of Greenville in 1585. Raleigh, at his own expense,\r\nsent a shipload of supplies for them next year, but before it arrived the\r\nsettlers, and the very Indians of whom such flattering accounts had been\r\ngiven, had quarrelled, and so many of the former had fallen as to imperil\r\nthe existence of the colony; the survivors thought themselves fortunate\r\nwhen Drake unexpectedly arrived off the coast, and took them away. When\r\nGreenville reached the settlement, a couple of weeks after, they had left\r\nno tidings of themselves, and, wishing to hold possession of the country,\r\nhe landed fifteen men, well furnished with all necessaries for two years’\r\nuse, on the island of Roanoake. This voyage paid its expenses by prizes\r\ntaken from the Spaniards, and by the plunder of the Azores on the way\r\nhome, where they spoiled “some of the towns of all such things as were\r\nworth carriage.”\r\n\r\nRaleigh, next season, fitted out a third expedition of three vessels, with\r\none hundred and fifty colonists, under the charge of John White, who was\r\nto be Governor, with twelve chosen persons as assistants: their town was\r\nto be named after himself. After narrowly escaping shipwreck, they arrived\r\noff Roanoake, and White, taking the pinnace, went in search of the fifteen\r\nmen left in the preceding year, but “found none of them, nor any sign that\r\nthey had been there, saving only the bones of one of them, whom the\r\nsavages had slain long before.” Next day they proceeded to the western\r\nside of the island, where they found the houses which had been erected\r\nstill standing, but the fort had been razed. They “were overgrown with\r\nmelons of divers sorts,” and deer were feeding on the melons. While they\r\nwere employed repairing these, and erecting others, one George Howe\r\nwandered some two miles away, when a party of half-naked Indians, who were\r\nengaged in catching crabs in the water, espied him. “They shot at him,\r\ngave him sixteen wounds with their arrows, and after they had slain him\r\nwith their wooden swords, they beat his head in pieces, and fled over the\r\nwater to the main.” Captain Amadas had taken an Indian named Manteo to\r\nEngland with him, and this man, now with White, was sent to the island of\r\nCroatoan, where his tribe dwelt, to assure them of the friendship of the\r\nEnglish, and an understanding was established. It was ascertained that the\r\nmen left the preceding year had been treacherously attacked by hostile\r\nnatives, and that two had been killed, and their storehouse burned; the\r\nremainder had successfully fought through the Indians to the water’s edge,\r\nand had escaped in their boat, whither they knew not. Their fate was never\r\nlearned. Manteo’s friends entreated that a badge should be given them, as\r\nsome of them had been attacked and wounded the previous year by mistake.\r\nSomething similar occurred shortly afterwards, when the English, burning\r\nto avenge Howe’s death, attacked a settlement in the night, shooting one\r\nof the men through the body before they discovered that the natives there\r\nwere of the friendly tribe. According to Raleigh’s instructions, Manteo\r\nwas christened, and called lord of Roanoake. About this time, the wife of\r\nAnanias Dare, one of the twelve assistants, was delivered of a daughter,\r\nwho, as the first English child born in that country, was very naturally\r\nbaptised by the name of Virginia. And now the ships had unladen the\r\nplanter’s stores, and were preparing for departure. It was deemed\r\nadvisable that two of the assistants should go back to England as factors\r\nand representatives of the company, but all appeared anxious to stop. At\r\nlength the whole party, with one voice urged White to return, “for the\r\nbetter and sooner obtaining of supplies and other necessaries for them.”\r\nThis he very naturally refused, as it would look at home as though the\r\nGovernor had deserted his band, and had led so many into a country in\r\nwhich he never meant to stay himself. But at last he yielded to them, and\r\nwas furnished with a testimonial setting forth the reasons. White arrived\r\nin England at a period when the danger of a Spanish invasion was imminent,\r\na most unfortunate time for the colonists. When Raleigh was preparing\r\nsupplies for them, which Greenville was to have taken out, the order was\r\ncountermanded. White represented the urgency of their wants, and two small\r\npinnaces were despatched with supplies, and fifteen planters on board.\r\nInstead of proceeding to America, they commenced cruising for prizes,\r\ntill, disabled and rifled by two men-of-war from Rochelle, they were\r\nobliged to retreat to England. And now Raleigh, who is said to have\r\nalready expended £40,000 over these attempts at colonisation, appears to\r\nhave sickened of them, and to have assigned his patent to a company of\r\nmerchant adventurers. White did his utmost for the poor settlers he\r\nrepresented, and learning that some English ships were about to proceed to\r\nthe West Indies, tried his best to arrange that they should take some\r\nprovisions and stores to Virginia, the upshot of which was that he only\r\nobtained a passage for himself.\r\n\r\nThe colony had now been left to itself for two years. When the vessels\r\nanchored near the spot, they observed a great smoke on the island of\r\nRoanoake, and White, who had a married daughter among the colonists, hoped\r\nthat it might proceed from one of their camps. Two boats put off from the\r\nships, and the gunners were ordered to prepare three guns, “well loaded,\r\nand to shoot them off with reasonable space between each shot, to the end\r\nthat their reports might be heard at the place where they hoped to find\r\nsome of their people.” Their first search was vain, for though they\r\nreached the spot from which the smoke came, there were no signs of life\r\nthere. The next day a second search was made, but one of the boats was\r\nswamped, and the captain and four others were drowned. The sailors averred\r\nthat they would not seek further for the colonists; they were, however,\r\nover-ruled, and another attempt was made. Again they noted a great fire in\r\nthe woods, and when the boat neared it, they let their grapnel fall, and\r\nsounded a trumpet, playing tunes familiar at the time; but there was no\r\nresponse. They landed at daybreak, and proceeded to the place where the\r\ncolony had been left. “All the way,” says White, “we saw in the sand the\r\nprint of the savages’ feet trodden that night; and as we entered up the\r\nsandy bank, upon a tree at the very brow thereof were curiously carved\r\nthese fair Roman letters, C R O, which letters presently we knew to\r\nsignify the place where I should find the planters seated, according to a\r\ntoken agreed upon at my departure.” He had told them in case of distress\r\nto carve over the letters or name a cross; but no such sign was found. At\r\nthe spot itself where he expected the settlement, he found the houses\r\ntaken down, and the place enclosed with logs or trees. Many heavy\r\narticles, bars of iron, pigs of lead, shot, and so forth, were lying\r\nabout, almost overgrown with grass and weeds. Five chests, of which three\r\nwere his own, were found at last, but they had been evidently broken into\r\nby the savages. “About the place,” says White, “many of my things, spoiled\r\nand broken, and my books torn from the covers, the frames of some of my\r\npictures and maps rotten and spoiled with rain, and my armour almost eaten\r\nthrough with rust.” But on one of the trees or chief posts of the\r\nenclosure, the word CROATOAN was carved in large letters, and he now\r\nunderstood that they were with Manteo’s tribe. It was agreed that they\r\nshould make for that place; but again fortune was against them.\r\n\r\nOne disaster followed another, and when at last they left Virginia, it was\r\nwith the intention of wintering in the West Indies, and returning the\r\nfollowing spring; but even this was not to be. Stress of weather drove\r\nthem to the Azores, and once there it was naturally decided to return to\r\nEngland. No later attempt was made to succour them, and the fate of\r\nninety-one men, seventeen women, and nine children, and of two infants\r\nborn there, the names of which are preserved in Hakluyt, was never known.\r\nRaleigh has been greatly blamed for inhumanity in this connection. His\r\nexcuse is that it was the busiest part of his eventful life. He had just\r\nborne his part in the defeat of the Armada; had been one of eleven hundred\r\ngentlemen who ventured on the unfortunate Portuguese expedition; had been\r\nsent, in what was regarded as an honourable banishment, but none the less\r\nan exile, to Ireland; on regaining his place in the queen’s favour had\r\ntaken an active part in Parliamentary service; was concerned in a fresh\r\nnaval expedition from which he was recalled by the queen, and had his\r\nfirst taste of that cell in the Tower, which later on he left only for the\r\nscaffold.\r\n\r\nIn 1595, we find Raleigh bent on a discovery which had long been a\r\nfeverish dream with him—the conquest of the fabled El Dorado. It was but\r\nthe result of the discoveries of the Spaniards in Mexico and Peru; and all\r\nover the Spanish main there was a fond belief extant in something greater\r\nand richer than anything yet found. One of the traditions of the day was\r\nthat a relative of the last reigning Inca of Peru, escaping from the wreck\r\nof that empire, with a large part of its remaining forces and treasure,\r\nhad established himself in a new country, which was found to be itself as\r\nrich in mines as that from which he had migrated. “The Spaniards,” says\r\nSouthey, “lost more men in seeking for this imaginary kingdom than in the\r\nconquest of Mexico and Peru.”\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: RALEIGH AT TRINIDAD.]\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: SIR WALTER RALEIGH.]\r\n\r\nRaleigh was encouraged in this enterprise by such men as Cecil, and the\r\nLord High Admiral Howard, who contributed to its cost. His idea was to\r\nenter the land of gold by the Orinoco, and prior to his own voyage he\r\ndespatched a ship, under Captain Whiddon, to reconnoitre on that part of\r\nthe coast, and to seek information at the island of Trinidad. When Raleigh\r\nand his squadron had arrived at one of its ports he found a company of\r\nSpaniards from whom he cautiously extracted all they knew or believed\r\nconcerning Guiana. “For these poor soldiers,” says he, “having been many\r\nyears without wine, a few draughts made them merry; in which mood they\r\nvaunted of Guiana, and of the riches thereof, and all what they knew of\r\nthe bays and passages, myself seeming to purpose nothing less than the\r\nentrance or discovery thereof, but bred in them an opinion that I was\r\nbound only for the relief of those English whom I had planted in Virginia,\r\nwhereof the bruit was come among them, which I had performed in my return\r\nif extremity of weather had not forced me from the said coast.” Raleigh\r\nstopped some time here, not merely to extract all the information\r\npossible, but also to be revenged on the Governor, who the year before had\r\nbehaved treacherously, entrapping eight of Captain Whiddon’s men. This he\r\naccomplished by taking and burning one of their new towns, and detaining\r\nthe Governor, Berrio, at his pleasure on board. The same day two more of\r\nhis ships arrived, and they prepared for the purposed discovery. “And\r\nfirst,” says Raleigh, “I called all the captains (_i.e._, caciques or\r\nnative chiefs) of the island together that were enemies to the Spaniards;\r\n* * * and by my Indian interpreter, which I carried out of England, I made\r\nthem understand that I was the servant of the queen, who was the great\r\ncacique of the north, and a virgin, and had more caciqui under her than\r\nthere were trees on that island; that she was an enemy to the Castellani\r\n(_i.e._, Spanish from Castille) in respect of their tyranny and\r\noppression, and that she delivered all such nations about her as were by\r\nthem oppressed; and having freed all the coast of the northern world from\r\ntheir servitude, had sent me to free them also, and withal to defend the\r\ncountry of Guiana from their invasion and conquest. I showed them her\r\nMajesty’s picture, which they so admired and honoured as it had been easy\r\nto have brought them idolatrous thereof.” Raleigh used the Governor with\r\ncourtesy and hospitality, and sounded him well concerning Guiana; and\r\nBerrio conversed with him readily, having no suspicion of Raleigh’s\r\nintentions. But when Sir Walter told him that he had resolved to see that\r\ncountry, the Governor “was stricken into a great melancholy,” and tried\r\nall he could to dissuade him. He described the rivers as full of\r\nsandbanks, and so shallow that no bark or pinnace could ascend them, and\r\nscarcely a ship’s boat; that they could not carry provisions for half the\r\njourney, and that the “kings and lords of all the borders of Guiana had\r\ndecreed that none of them should trade with any Christians for gold,\r\nbecause the same would be their own overthrow, and that for the love of\r\ngold the Christians meant to conquer and dispossess them altogether.” The\r\ngolden country was 600 miles farther from the coast than he had been\r\ninformed, which piece of news Raleigh carefully concealed from his\r\ncompany, for he was resolved “to make trial of all, whatsoever happened.”\r\nAfter many explorations, on the part of his captains, of the rivers, the\r\nmouths of which were found to be as shallow as he had been told, he, with\r\n100 men divided in a galley, four boats and barges, and carrying\r\nprovisions for a month, resolved to see for himself.\r\n\r\nFrom the spot where the ships lay, they had as much sea to cross as\r\nbetween Dover and Calais, the waves being high, and the current strong.\r\nThey at length entered a stream, which Raleigh called the River of the Red\r\nCross, and where they noted Indians in a canoe and on the banks. Their\r\ninterpreters, Ferdinando and his brother, went ashore to fetch fruit, and\r\ndrink with the natives, when they were seized by the chief with the\r\nintention of putting them to death, because “they had brought a strange\r\nnation into their territory to spoil and destroy them.” Ferdinando and his\r\nbrother managed to escape, the former running into the woods, and the\r\nlatter reaching the mouth of the creek where the barge was staying, when\r\nhe cried out that his brother was slain. On hearing this, “we set hands,”\r\nsays Raleigh, “on one of them that was next us, a very old man, and\r\nbrought him into the barge, assuring him that if we had not our pilot\r\nagain we would presently cut off his head.” The old man called to his\r\ntribe to save Ferdinando, but they hunted him through the forest, with\r\nshouts that made the whole neighbourhood resound. At length he reached the\r\nwater, and climbing out on an overhanging tree, dropped down and swam to\r\nthe barge, half dead with fear. The old Indian was retained as pilot.\r\n\r\nAscending with the flood, and anchoring during ebb tide, they went on,\r\ntill on the third day their galley grounded, and stuck so fast that it was\r\na question whether their discoveries must not end there; but at last, by\r\nlightening her of all her ballast, and hauling and tugging, she was once\r\nmore afloat. Next day they reached a fine river, where there was no flood\r\ntide from the sea, and they had to contend against a strong current; “and\r\nhad then,” says Raleigh, “no shift but to persuade the company that it was\r\nbut two or three days’ work” to reach their destination. “When three days\r\nwere overgone, our companies began to despair, the weather being extreme\r\nhot, the river bordered with very high trees that kept away the air, and\r\nthe current against us every day stronger than the other; but we once more\r\ncommanded our pilots to promise to end the next day, and used it so long\r\nas we were driven to assure them from four reaches of the river to three,\r\nand so to two, and so to the next reach; but so long we laboured that many\r\ndays were spent, and we driven to draw ourselves to harder allowance, our\r\nbread even at the last and no drink at all; and ourselves so wearied and\r\nscorched, and doubtful withal whether we should ever perform it or no, the\r\nheat increasing as we drew towards the line, for we were now in five\r\ndegrees. The farther we went on (our victuals decreasing and the air\r\nbreeding great faintness) we grew weaker and weaker, when we had most need\r\nof strength and ability, for hourly the river ran more violently than\r\nother against us; and the barge, wherries, and ship’s boat had spent all\r\ntheir provisions, so as we were brought into despair and discomfort, had\r\nwe not persuaded all the company that it was but one day’s work more to\r\nattain the land, where we should be relieved of all we wanted; and if we\r\nreturned that we should be sure to starve by the way, and that the world\r\nwould also laugh us to scorn.” The old Indian now offered to take them to\r\na town at a short distance, where they could get bread, hams, fish, and\r\nwine, but to reach it they must leave the galley, and proceed up a smaller\r\nstream with the barge and wherries. Raleigh, with two of his captains and\r\nsixteen musketeers started, but when, after hard rowing, it grew night,\r\nand there were no signs of the place, they feared treachery. The old\r\nnative still assured them that it was but a little further, and they rowed\r\non past reach after reach, and still no town or settlement could be\r\ndiscovered. At last they decided to hang the pilot, and Raleigh states\r\ndistinctly that “if we had well known the way back again by night, he had\r\nsurely gone, but our own necessities pleaded sufficiently for his safety,\r\nfor it was now as dark as pitch, and the river began so to narrow itself,\r\nand the trees to hang from side, so as we were driven with arming swords\r\nto cut a passage through those branches that covered the water.” At last,\r\nan hour after midnight, a light was seen, and the welcome noise of the\r\nvillage dogs heard, as they rowed towards it. There were few natives there\r\nat the time, but some quantity of provisions was obtained, with which they\r\nreturned to the galley next day. The natives called this stream the river\r\nof alligators, and a negro, who was one of the galley’s crew, venturing to\r\nswim in it, was devoured by one of those animals. Raleigh says of the\r\ncountry through which it passed, “whereas all that we had seen before was\r\nnothing but woods, prickly bushes, and thorns, here we beheld plains of\r\ntwenty miles in length, the grass short and green, and in divers parts\r\ngroves of trees by themselves, as if they had with all the art and labour\r\nin the world been so made of purpose; and still as we rowed, the deer came\r\ndown feeding by the water’s side, as if they had been used to a keeper’s\r\ncall.”\r\n\r\nStill proceeding up the great river, their provisions almost exhausted,\r\nthey observed four canoes coming down the stream, to which they gave\r\nchase. The people in two of the larger escaped into the woods, and left\r\nbehind a large stock of bread, which was very welcome. Searching the\r\nwoods, Raleigh came across an Indian basket, which proved to be that of a\r\nrefiner, as it contained quicksilver, saltpetre, and other things for\r\ngathering and testing metals, and also the dust of such as he had\r\ndiscovered. Raleigh offered £500 to the soldier who should take one of\r\nthree Spaniards known to have been with this party, but they escaped. He\r\nwas more fortunate with the Indians who had accompanied them, and one of\r\nthem was taken for pilot, from whom he learned that the richest mines were\r\n“defended with rocks of hard stones, which we call white spar” (presumably\r\nquartz). He states that in the canoes which escaped there was a good\r\nquantity of ore and gold.\r\n\r\nStill proceeding, on the fifteenth day, to their great joy, the distant\r\nmountains of Guiana came into view, and the same day brought them in sight\r\nof the great Orinoco, about the branches of which river thousands of\r\ntortoise eggs were found, which proved to be “very wholesome meat, and\r\ngreatly restoring.” The natives, too, were friendly, and to Raleigh’s\r\ncredit, be it said, he appears in all cases to have treated them fairly\r\nand well. With the cacique he made merry, treating the natives to a small\r\nquantity of Spanish wine, they in return bringing in fruits, bread, fish,\r\nand flesh. The chief conducted them to his own town, “where,” says\r\nRaleigh, “some of our captains caroused of his wine till they were\r\nreasonably pleasant; for it is very strong with pepper, and the juice of\r\ndivers herbs digested and purged; they keep it in great earthen pots of\r\nten or twelve gallons, very clear and sweet; and are themselves at their\r\nmeetings and feasts the greatest carousers and drunkards in the world.”\r\nThe settlement stood on a low hill, “with goodly gardens a mile compass\r\nround about it.” And so they proceeded, meeting friendliness everywhere\r\namong the natives, till the rivers commenced fast rising, and they could\r\nnot row against the stream. Small parties were then detailed ashore to\r\nlook for mineral stones. Raleigh describes the country as lovely; “the\r\ndeer crossing in every path; the birds towards the evening singing on\r\nevery tree with a thousand several tunes; cranes and herons, of white,\r\ncrimson, and carnation, perching on the river’s side; the air fresh with a\r\ngentle easterly wind; _and every stone that we stooped to take up promised\r\neither gold or silver by its complexion_. * * * I hope some of them cannot\r\nbe bettered under the sun; and yet we had no means but with our daggers\r\nand fingers to tear them out here and there, the rocks being most hard, of\r\nthat mineral spar aforesaid, which is like a flint, and is altogether as\r\nhard, or harder; and besides, the veins lie a fathom or two deep in the\r\nrocks. But we wanted all things requisite, save only our desires and good\r\nwill, to have performed more, if it had pleased God.” Some of the others\r\nbrought glistening stones, and among them, apparently pyrites, which very\r\ncommonly accompanies gold, but of the precious metal itself Raleigh could\r\nhardly boast a speck in truth. His account of these discoveries is mixed\r\nup with the strangest fables, as for example of the Ewaipanoma, a people\r\nof that country whose eyes were in their shoulders, and their mouths in\r\nthe middle of their breasts!\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: RALEIGH ON THE RIVER.]\r\n\r\nThe ships were regained, and the expedition sailed for England, where\r\nRaleigh, in spite of the work which he published under the boastful title\r\nof “The Discovery of the Large, Rich, and Beautiful Empire of Guiana, with\r\na Relation of the Great and Golden City of Manoa (which the Spaniards call\r\nEl Dorado),” &c., lost both popular and queenly favour, having brought\r\nhome no booty. In fact the narrative given to the world rather did him\r\nharm than good, for it is full of excuses, admits that the voyage had been\r\nmost unprofitable, and is undoubtedly not veracious in many particulars.\r\nHis arguments for immediately attempting the conquest of Guiana were not\r\nregarded. Yet still he had means and friends. Two expeditions to Guiana\r\nwere afterwards organised, neither of which resulted in any discovery or\r\nprofit.\r\n\r\nBut others besides Raleigh and his followers had been inflamed with the\r\naccounts floating about concerning El Dorado. Berrio, the Spanish Governor\r\nbefore mentioned, despatched his camp master to Spain to levy men, sending\r\nwith him some golden carvings and “images, as well of men as beasts,\r\nbirds, and fishes,” in order to obtain further aid from the king and his\r\nsubjects. This agent, Domingo de Vera, was a man of ability, and\r\nthoroughly unscrupulous; he courted notoriety by appearing always in a\r\nsingular dress, adorned with golden trinkets and jewels, and being of\r\ngreat stature, and riding always a great horse, attracted much attention,\r\nbeing known popularly as the Indian El Dorado. He was successful in\r\nraising seventy thousand ducats at Madrid, and a large additional sum at\r\nSeville: obtained authority for raising a band of adventurers, and five\r\ngood ships to carry them out. Men of good birth left their estates,\r\nrespectable middle-class men gave up their incomes and employments, sold\r\neverything, and embarked with their wives and children; even a prebendary,\r\nand many priests, gave up sure prospects of advancement to join the\r\nexpedition, which at last aggregated two thousand persons. Berrio had only\r\nasked for 300, and when the expedition reached Trinidad, they had to be\r\napportioned to various other settlements; the women and children being\r\nserious encumbrances at the time, and enduring great misery. The savage\r\nCaribs attacked their canoes when proceeding to St. Thomas and elsewhere.\r\nOne detachment of three hundred were reduced to thirty souls by the crafty\r\nIndians, who, after very partially supplying them with provisions, watched\r\nthem sink with weakness and disease till they became an easy prey. In some\r\nplaces they set fire to the grass, and the wretched travellers, unable to\r\nfly before it, were burned to death. Those who reached the Orinoco, not\r\nmerely found no gold, but little of that abundance so glowingly described\r\nby Raleigh. Vera himself soon died in Trinidad, and Berrio did not long\r\nsurvive him. Of the original two thousand who left Spain, it is doubtful\r\nwhether a tithe survived the first year. Had Raleigh been a favourite with\r\nthe people, or had his character been above suspicion, it is more than\r\nlikely that some similar disaster might have had to be recorded on the\r\npages of English history.\r\n\r\nSir Walter Raleigh has enlightened us,(1) as regards the condition of\r\ncommerce and of the English mercantile marine shortly before the union of\r\nthe crown of England and Scotland, in a remarkable paper, “which\r\ncontains,” says a competent authority, “many remarkable commercial\r\nprinciples far in advance of the age in which the author lived.” He states\r\nthat the ships of England were not to be compared with those of the Dutch,\r\nand that while an English ship of one hundred tons required a crew of\r\nthirty men, the Dutch would sail such a vessel with one-third that number.\r\nHolland became the depôt of numerous articles, “not one hundredth part of\r\nwhich were consumed by the Dutch,” while she gave “free custom inwards and\r\noutwards for the better maintenance of navigation and encouragement of the\r\npeople to that business.” Sir Walter tells us that France offered to the\r\nvessels of all nations free customs twice and sometimes three times each\r\nyear when she laid in her annual stock of provisions, and also in such raw\r\nmaterials as were not possessed by herself in equal abundance. Denmark\r\ngranted free customs the year through, excepting only one month. The Dutch\r\nwere the great carriers by sea, in consequence of the facilities granted\r\nthem at home, “and yet the situation of England lieth far better for a\r\nstorehouse to serve the south-east and the north-east kingdoms than theirs\r\ndo; and we have far the better means to do it if we apply ourselves to do\r\nit.” He complained that although the greatest fishery in the world is on\r\nthe coasts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, Holland despatched to the\r\nBaltic and up the Rhine more than a million pounds sterling worth of\r\nherrings, where we did not export one. He states that Holland trafficked\r\nin “every city and port of Britain with five or six hundred ships yearly,\r\nand we chiefly to three towns in their country and with forty ships; the\r\nDutch trade to every port and town in France, and we only to five or six,”\r\nand that the Dutch were even ruining our Russian trade. In spite of\r\nprobable exaggerations in Raleigh’s statements as laid before the King, it\r\nis evident that with the laws as they stood, the Dutch must have had, as\r\nregards their commercial marine, very much the best of it.\r\n\r\nWhile there was much depression among the shipowners, they did not\r\noverlook the advantages to be derived from intercourse with the\r\nnewly-discovered world of North America. Though the expeditions promoted\r\nby Raleigh and his associates had been unfortunate, profitable ventures\r\nwere soon after made, beads, trinkets, and articles of little value being\r\nexchanged for skins and furs obtained by the Indians; and Captain Gosnold\r\nmade in 1602 the first _direct_ voyage across the Atlantic to America—all\r\nother English sailors at least having sailed by way of the Canaries and\r\nWest Indies. “Steering in a small bark, directly across the Atlantic, in\r\nseven weeks he reached Cape Elizabeth on the coast of Maine. Following the\r\ncoast to the south-west, he skirted ‘an outpoint of wooded land;’ and\r\nabout noon of the 14th of May he anchored ‘near Savage Rock,’ to the east\r\nof York Harbour.... Not finding his ‘purposed place’ he stood to the\r\nsouth, and on the morning of the 15th discovered the promontory which he\r\nnamed Cape Cod. He and four of his men went on shore. Cape Cod was the\r\nfirst spot in New England ever trod by Englishman.” He traded with the\r\nnatives in peltries, sassafras, and cedar-wood, and was probably the first\r\nto sow English corn on the Island of Martha’s Vineyard. In 1606 two\r\nmaritime companies, the “Plymouth Adventurers,” and the South Virginia\r\nCompany, were authorised to colonise and form plantations; the first\r\nhaving right to the territory which now embraces Pennsylvania, New Jersey,\r\nand New York; and the second, to that which now includes Maryland,\r\nVirginia, and North and South Carolina. A single steamer of these days has\r\noften landed more emigrants at New York than did a dozen of these early\r\nexpeditions at other points, for their progress at first was painfully\r\nslow.\r\n\r\nThe great East India Company was formed in England more than a century\r\nafter the discovery, by Vasco de Gama, of the route to India _viâ_ the\r\nCape. The first voyage of Thomas Cavendish is worthy of more note than it\r\nhas received, inasmuch as it contributed more than anything else to\r\nawakening the merchants of London to the importance of the trade prospects\r\nthere. Starting in July, 1586, he circumnavigated the globe, passing\r\nthrough the Straits of Magellan westward, in eight months less than Drake.\r\nHe was the first English navigator to discern the value of the position of\r\nSt. Helena, to describe with accuracy the Philippine Islands, and to bring\r\nhome a map and description of China; and what is more remarkable is the\r\nfact that he was scarcely more than twenty-two years of age when he took\r\ncommand in this first most adventurous voyage. He was shipwrecked five or\r\nsix years later on the coast of Brazil, and lost his life there. Through\r\nMr. Thorne, an English merchant, often mentioned in connection with these\r\nearly voyages, the London merchants gained a considerable amount of\r\nknowledge relating to the important trade with the Indies enjoyed by the\r\nSpanish and Portuguese; and at length, in the year 1600, more than 200\r\nshipowners, traders, and citizens associated, and formed a body corporate,\r\nhaving received many special privileges from the Crown, “including,” says\r\nLindsay,(2) “that of punishing offenders either in body or purse, provided\r\nthe mode of punishment was not repugnant to the laws of England. Its\r\nexports were not subjected to any duties for the four first voyages,\r\nimportant indulgences were granted in paying the duties on imports, and\r\nliberty was given to export £30,000 each voyage in coin or bullion,\r\nprovided £6,000 of this sum passed through the Mint. But not exceeding six\r\nships, and an equal number of pinnaces, with 500 seamen, were allowed to\r\nbe despatched annually to whatever station might be formed in India, with\r\nthe additional provisoes that the seamen were not at the time required for\r\nthe service of the Royal Navy, and that all gold and silver exported by\r\nthe Company should be shipped at either London, Dartmouth, or Plymouth.”\r\nThe Company started with a capital of £72,000, and equipped five vessels\r\nfor the first venture, the largest of which was the _Dragon_ of 600 tons;\r\nher commander, according to the practice of the day, receiving the title\r\nof “Admiral of the Squadron.” The first voyage was very successful;\r\nimportant commercial relations were formed with the King of Achin, in\r\nSumatra; and a factory established at Bantam, after which the ships\r\nreturned to England richly laden.\r\n\r\nA serious rival was, however, in the field. The separation of the Dutch\r\nprovinces from the crown of Spain had caused their merchants to be sent\r\nabroad to seek new fields of commerce, and as they had gained an intimate\r\nknowledge of Spanish and Portuguese affairs, they were then the\r\npredominant naval power in the Indian Seas, and were quite ready to\r\ncontend against any supremacy on the part of England’s traders. English\r\nmerchants were, however, ready for them, the profits on the first\r\nexpedition having incited them to grander efforts. They obtained a new\r\nCharter in 1609, and the Company constructed a vessel of larger size than\r\nany hitherto employed in the English merchant service, which they named\r\nthe _Trades’ Increase_. She was 1,200 tons, and even her pinnace was 250\r\ntons. At her launch, the Company gave a great banquet, at which the dishes\r\nwere of china ware, then a great novelty in England. With these and two\r\nother vessels Sir Henry Middleton set sail, touching at Mocha, on the Red\r\nSea, where, entrapped ashore by the Mohammedans, eighty of his crew were\r\nmassacred, sixteen others disabled, and he himself severely wounded.\r\nProceeding to Bantam, the _Trades’ Increase_ was unfortunately\r\nshipwrecked, and poor Middleton died heartbroken at the failure of the\r\nexpedition. But other voyages followed, which were enormously profitable\r\nto the Company. One expedition is mentioned which, “though absent only\r\ntwenty months, earned in that time a profit of no less than 340 per cent.”\r\n“Factories”—trading posts or forts—were established, and the Company\r\nobtained the favour of the Moghul Emperor, Jehangir, more especially after\r\nthey had been fortunate enough to repel some of the Portuguese who were\r\nattacking his posts. They even contrived to obtain a footing in Japan,\r\nthrough the influence of William Adams, a Kentish man, who had been pilot\r\non one of the earliest Dutch expeditions, and who stood high in the\r\nEmperor’s favour. The intercourse then opened was allowed to die out, and\r\nhas only been re-established late in our own time. In seventeen years\r\nafter the first establishment of the Company its affairs had become so\r\nprosperous that its stock reached a premium of 203 per cent., and the\r\nDutch East India Company suggested an amalgamation of the two corporations\r\nwith a view to exclude and crush their common enemy, the Portuguese. This\r\nwas never carried into effect, but in 1619 a treaty of trade and\r\nfriendship was established. They were to “cease from rivalry, and\r\napportion the profits of the different branches of commerce between them.”\r\nAlas! all this amicable billing and cooing were to speedily end; such\r\nself-abnegation was found hardly practicable between business rivals. A\r\nseries of hostilities ensued in the following year; a number of Englishmen\r\nwere massacred by the Dutch at Amboyna, and sea-fights occurred between\r\nthe vessels; the result being that the Dutch had it all their own way in a\r\nfew years afterwards. The directors of the English Company even meditated\r\nwinding up its affairs. Something similar happened more than once\r\nafterwards before they became a grand company and the real governors of\r\nIndia. The rise of British power there is one of those surprising\r\nrevolutions which never before occurred in history. The managers of a\r\ntrading company in London first became the lords of a manor a dozen times\r\nthe size of England, and controlled the destinies of kings and princes,\r\nengaging in war or peace as occasion seemed to demand. Think of the\r\naffairs of a great country settled in a counting-house! But at length the\r\nanomaly had to cease, and, as most readers will remember, the East India\r\nCompany lost its powers and privileges in 1858, and ceased to exist as a\r\ngoverning body. Retiring allowances were made to commanders and officers.\r\nIt may be interesting to note that up to 1814 trade with India, so long a\r\njealously-guarded monopoly with the Company, was thrown open to private\r\ncompetition, but that they retained the exclusive trade with China for a\r\nlong period after that date.\r\n\r\nA trifling digression may be allowed here, as it really bears on our\r\nsubject. The East India Company was long a synonym for everything that was\r\nrich and powerful, and many of its civil servants visited or retired to\r\nEngland as opulent and independent men. The maritime branch of the service\r\nreceived a goodly slice of the pie; and some facts relating thereto\r\nrecorded by Lindsay, the authority before quoted, himself long a great\r\nshipowner, will astonish and interest the reader. A commander’s position\r\nin the H. E. I. Co.’s service was most assuredly worth having, for his\r\nsalary was a very small part indeed of his receipts. The Company granted a\r\nnumber of “indulgences” to their naval officers, of which the following\r\nare only part. Ninety-seven tons of space were reserved for the commander\r\nand officers, of which the former of course took the lion’s share, 56½\r\ntons. They were permitted to import on the homeward voyage tea to the\r\nfollowing extent:—9,336 lbs. for the commander, 1,228 lbs. for first mate,\r\nand the lower grades were each privileged in the same way, but to a\r\nsmaller extent. The officers might bring in China-ware as a flooring for\r\nthe tea-chests, the quantity of which might range from 20 to 40 tons,\r\naccording to the size of the vessel. They were even allowed surplus\r\ntonnage, when it could be safely and conveniently carried. The commander\r\nreceived as his perquisite the passage-money paid by _all_ private\r\npassengers, the cost of their provisions and wine being alone deducted.\r\nHis table was luxuriously supplied, and he was allowed to import for his\r\nown use two butts of Madeira wine. The first mate had, among his extra\r\nallowances, and quite apart from the regular supply of provisions on\r\nboard, 24 dozen of wine or beer, 2 firkins of butter, 1 cwt. of cheese, 1\r\ncwt. of groceries, and 4 quarter casks of pickles for the voyage. Lindsay\r\nsays, “So many were their privileges, and so numerous their perquisites,\r\nthat during five India or China voyages a captain of one of the Company’s\r\nships ought to have realised sufficient capital to be independent for the\r\nrest of his life.” He was, in effect, a merchant, doing business for\r\nhimself while in the employ of a large mercantile concern, and his\r\nofficers were the same on a smaller scale. The above writer considers that\r\nthe direct and inevitable remuneration to a commander was from £3,000 to\r\n£5,000 per round voyage, out and home, but that with his privileges and\r\nperquisites it might and often did reach £8,000 to £10,000, or more. He\r\nmentions one instance which came within his own knowledge, where “the\r\ncommander of one of the ships employed on the ‘double voyage’—that is from\r\nLondon to India, thence to China, and thence back to London, where he had\r\na large interest in the freight on cotton or other produce conveyed from\r\nIndia to China—realised no less than £30,000.” And yet some of them were\r\nnot satisfied, and the Company had to make laws and investigations\r\nconcerning illicit trading and smuggling with the connivance of the Custom\r\nHouse officers. Some of the commanders had even put into ports for which\r\nthey had no orders, to carry out their own purposes.\r\n\r\nThe internal economy of an East Indiaman was, as regards discipline and\r\norder, modelled for the most part upon that of a man-of-war, and carried\r\nmore men, twice over, than does many a modern steamer double her tonnage.\r\nThus, one of the finest vessels of the Company, mentioned by Lindsay, was\r\nfor a considerable period the _Earl of Balcarras_. She was of 1,417 tons,\r\nand had 130 souls on board. After the commander came six mates, a surgeon\r\nand assistant, six midshipmen, purser, boatswain, gunner, carpenter,\r\nmaster-at-arms, armourer, butcher, baker, poulterer, caulker, cooper, two\r\nstewards, two cooks, eight boatswain’s, gunner’s, carpenter’s, caulker’s,\r\nand cooper’s mates; six quartermasters, a sailmaker, seven servants for\r\nofficers, and seventy-eight seamen. But we are wandering from our theme.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: MONSON AND THE BISCAYAN SHIP.]\r\n\r\nThe reign of Elizabeth was a glorious epoch in the history of naval\r\naffairs, and great names crowd upon us. It is impossible to pass by that\r\nof Sir William Monson, who served his country for fifty years, through\r\nthree reigns, and whose “Naval Tracts” are almost as valuable as were his\r\nservices, illustrating as they do the condition of the navy and maritime\r\naffairs of the period, and abounding in the details of well-described\r\nexploits.\r\n\r\nMonson was of a good Lincolnshire family, and at an early age entered\r\nBaliol College, Oxford, where he remained a couple of years, till the\r\nexcitement of the war with Spain determined him to run away to sea, as he\r\ndid not expect to get the consent of his parents. At this date, 1585, he\r\nwas only sixteen years of age. “I put myself,” says he, “into an action by\r\nsea, where there was in company of us two small ships, fitted for\r\nmen-of-war, that authorised us by commission to seize upon the subjects of\r\nthe King of Spain; then made I the sea my profession, being led to it by\r\nthe wildness of my youth.” He had not long to wait for adventure. “A\r\nstrong and obstinate ship of Holland” was encountered, whose captain had\r\nthe audacity not to strike his flag immediately, when required to do so.\r\nThe Dutch vessel had an English pilot on board, through whom communication\r\nwas held; and the master of the privateer, by a ruse of navigation,\r\nordering his helmsman in a loud voice to port his helm, while in an\r\nundertone he instructed him to do just the reverse, nearly fouled the\r\nDutchman, whose men got out oars and fenders to prevent the impending\r\ncollision. “When we saw their people thus employed,” says Monson,(3) “and\r\nnot to have time to take arms, we suddenly boarded, entered, and took her\r\nby this stratagem.” Monson, when an old man, used to chuckle over his\r\nboyish share in this exploit, and includes it among “stratagems to be used\r\nat sea” in his “Tracts.”\r\n\r\nBut he was to have speedily a better opportunity of distinguishing\r\nhimself. The privateer on which he served—for she was nothing\r\nmore—encountered a large Biscayan ship off the Spanish coast, whose\r\ncaptain refused to strike. A few of the English crew, including Monson,\r\nmanaged to board her, when the sea suddenly rose, and this mere handful\r\nwere left on the Spaniard’s decks, while the privateer was compelled to\r\nungrapple. The storm increased, and it was not possible to succour the\r\nlittle band, who fought for _eleven_ hours, from eight o’clock in the\r\nevening to seven the next morning. The Spaniards attempted to blow up the\r\ndeck which they maintained, but “were prevented by fire-pikes,” and at\r\nlast surrendered after a desperate contest. The decks were covered with\r\nthe dead and dying. “I dare say,” says the narrator of the event, “that in\r\nthe whole time of the war there was not so rare a manner of fight, or so\r\ngreat a slaughter of men.” Monson, who had now received his “baptism of\r\nfire” with a vengeance, determined that nothing should take him from his\r\nadopted profession, and it is presumable that his friends became\r\nreconciled to it, for we find him suddenly raised, at one step, from the\r\ngrade of a volunteer to the rank of captain, although but eighteen years\r\nold! Family influence, doubtless, had something to do with it. Gentlemen\r\ncaptains, who were often brave men, but who knew little enough about naval\r\naffairs, were common in those days. Raleigh distinguishes them very\r\ndistinctly from the “tarpauling captain,” or mariner who had learned his\r\nprofession from a youth up. Monson, however, as his writings prove, soon\r\nbecame an adept in navigation and all the arts of seamanship.\r\n\r\nPassing over a voyage in which Monson was nearly shipwrecked, we come to\r\n1589, when he accompanied the Earl of Cumberland in his expedition to the\r\nAzores. The crews were reduced to great distress from want of water, and\r\nwhile cruising among the islands, a grand spout was seen issuing\r\napparently from one of their cliffs. Cumberland asked Monson to go with\r\nfour men and find out whether it was available for their use. While they\r\nwere rowing towards the land, a great whale, lying asleep on the water,\r\nwas noted from the ship, and was mistaken for a rock, whereupon the vessel\r\ntacked about and put to sea, leaving Monson to his fate. (The original\r\nnarrative does not explain whether the waterspout, noticed from the ship,\r\nhad proceeded from the whale, before it fell asleep.) “I had no sooner,”\r\nsays Monson, “set my foot ashore, than it began to be dark with night and\r\nfog, and to blow, rain, thunder, and lighten in the cruellest manner that\r\nI have seen. There was no way for me to escape death but to put myself to\r\nthe mercy of the sea; neither could I have any great hope of help in life,\r\nfor the ship was out of sight, and there only appeared a light upon the\r\nshrouds to direct me.” The narrative says that a countryman of Monson’s on\r\nboard prevailed upon his lordship (the Earl of Cumberland) to forbear\r\nsailing. This was, one would think, hardly necessary, as Monson was his\r\nsecond in command; but stress of weather will probably account for the\r\nvessel being driven some distance. They rowed and rowed, but lost all\r\nsight of the ship. At length, in despair, they fired their last charge of\r\npowder from a musket. The flash was seen through the fog, and they were\r\nsaved. “We were preserved,” says the narrative, “rather by miracle than\r\nany human act; and to make it the more strange we were no sooner risen\r\nfrom our seats, and ropes in our hands to enter the ship, but the boat\r\nsunk immediately.” The subsequent sufferings of the crew from the\r\ncontinued want of water have rarely been equalled. “For sixteen days\r\ntogether,” says Monson, “we never tasted a drop of drink, either of beer,\r\nwine, or water; and though we had plenty of beef and pork of a year’s\r\nsalting, yet did we forbear eating it, for making us the drier. Many drank\r\nsalt water, and those that did died suddenly; and the last words they\r\nusually spoke were ‘Drink, drink, drink!’” There were 500 men on board,\r\nand the mortality, though not expressly stated in numbers, is said to have\r\nbeen something fearful. At last they made the coast of Ireland, and\r\nobtained relief. So severely was Monson’s health affected by this voyage,\r\nthat he retired from the active pursuit of his profession for a year\r\nafterwards.\r\n\r\nAgain he joined the Earl of Cumberland in 1591 on an expedition directed\r\nagainst Spain, off the coasts of which he successfully took two caravels\r\nby one of the stratagems for which he was famous. He had boarded one from\r\nthe ship’s boat; he manned her with a part of his boat’s crew, and rowed\r\nback to his ship. The Spaniards on the other caravel far in the distance\r\nthought that the first, her consort, had been dismissed, and so shortened\r\nsail to meet her; and was consequently taken unawares by a mere handful of\r\nmen. But Monson only wanted to obtain information as to the enemy, and let\r\nthem both off. This act turned out fortunately for him; for shortly\r\nafterwards, being left in charge of a prize taken from the Dutch, he was\r\nattacked by the Spaniards in six galleys, the consequence being that he\r\nwas taken prisoner, when he found that his recent conduct towards the\r\ncaravels had been reported favourably, and he was treated with more\r\ncourtesy than had been usual before. But he was to suffer a long captivity\r\nfor all that. At the Tagus he would probably have escaped had not an\r\nunforeseen chance prevented. While the galleys were in the harbour, a\r\nBrazilian, master of a Dutch ship, chanced to come on board that on which\r\nMonson was confined, and, pitying his hard fate, offered to take him off\r\non his vessel, if he could devise any plan which should not implicate\r\nhimself. Monson gave out to the rest of the prisoners that, tired of his\r\nlife, he intended to drown himself. His intention really was to drop\r\nquietly into the water, and if possible swim to the friendly bark. But\r\njust before he had made his arrangements, the galleys were ordered to sea,\r\nand when they returned the ship had sailed. It is probably fortunate for\r\nhim that he did not make the attempt, as, had it been frustrated, he would\r\nhave probably suffered death, as did an Italian a short time afterwards,\r\nwho had been trying to raise a general conspiracy on board. His execution\r\nwas effected in the most horrible manner, his arms and legs being\r\nseverally tied to the sterns of four galleys, which were rowed in four\r\ndifferent directions, thus quartering him.\r\n\r\nMonson was afterwards removed to the castle of Lisbon, from which an\r\nattempt on his part to escape was frustrated by the treachery of an\r\nEnglish interpreter there, whom he had been forced to employ. Fortunately,\r\nthe letter which he had entrusted to a page, who was to have conveyed it\r\n_in his boots_ to Lord Burleigh, became so saturated and obliterated by\r\nrain, that nothing could be made of it, and the whole matter was allowed\r\nto pass. Not so, however, after he had helped a Portuguese to escape, who\r\nhad been condemned to death. The latter, aided by Monson’s skill, managed\r\nto pass the sentinels disguised as a soldier, and then lowering himself by\r\na rope, effected his plans. The flight having been discovered, Monson was\r\naccused of having assisted him, and was taken before the judge. “But\r\nneither threats nor promises of liberty could induce him to confess. He\r\npleaded that he was a prisoner of war, that he was subject to the law of\r\nhonour and arms, and that it was lawful for him to seek his freedom: he\r\nurged the improbability of holding such intercourse as was imputed to him\r\nwith one whose language he did not understand; and he concluded by\r\ncautioning them to be wary what violence they offered him, as he had\r\nfriends in England, and was of a nation that could and would revenge his\r\nwrongs.” The latter argument probably it was that carried the day; but\r\nuntil released—no doubt by exchange—he was closely guarded.\r\n\r\nIn 1593, Monson again joined Cumberland, and considering the fidelity\r\nwhich he had always shown to that admiral, the latter seems to have\r\ntreated him very badly. In the course of their voyage, a dozen Spanish\r\nhulks laden with powder were taken, half of which were left to Monson to\r\nhaul over, while his admiral put to sea with the rest. Monson had with him\r\nonly about fifty men. What was his surprise towards night to find that\r\nCumberland had released the hulks which he had taken, and that they were\r\ncrowding on all sail to join their consorts in his charge, with hostile\r\nintent, which it would be madness on his part to attempt to frustrate. He\r\nbarely escaped; when the enemy boarded him on one side of his vessel, he\r\nleaped into the long boat on the other side, receiving a wound which\r\nremained all his days. Southey certainly puts it mildly when he says, “The\r\nconduct of the Earl of Cumberland in this affair admits of no reasonable\r\nor satisfactory explanations,” for it looks far more like downright\r\ntreachery. A couple of years afterwards, the Earl very plainly declared\r\nhis colours by first inducing him to join him in his voyage, and then\r\nsuperseding him. Monson could not brook this, and returned, after some\r\nadventures, to England, where we soon find him with the Earl of Essex, in\r\nthe expedition to Cadiz. At that most remarkable siege, he was in the\r\nthick of the fight ashore with Essex, where he received a shot through his\r\nscarf and breeches; another shot took away the handle and pommel of his\r\nsword, while he remained uninjured. But his principal services were in\r\nconnection with the destruction of the fleet, which meant a loss of six or\r\nseven millions sterling to Spain. “The King of Spain,” says Monson, “never\r\nreceived so great an overthrow, and so great an indignity at our hands as\r\nthis; for our attempt was at his own home, in his own ports, that he\r\nthought as safe as his chamber, where we took and destroyed his ships of\r\nwar, burnt and consumed the wealth of his merchants, sacked his city,\r\nransomed his subjects, and entered his country without impeachment.”\r\nMonson was knighted for his conduct at this siege.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: MONSON AT CADIZ.]\r\n\r\nThe abundant “pluck” possessed by Monson is illustrated in the following\r\nexample. In 1597, on the island expedition, Monson’s ship was separated\r\nsome distance from the admiral’s squadron, when a fleet of twenty-five\r\nsail was noted approaching in the dead of the night. Not being able to\r\ndistinguish their flag, he determined to reconnoitre for himself, before\r\nsignalling to the English ships. He approached them in his boat, hailing\r\nthem in Spanish, and they, replying that they were of that nationality,\r\nasked whence he came. He replied that he was of England, and told them\r\nthat his ship, then in sight, was a royal galleon, and could be easily\r\ntaken, his object being to make them pursue him, so that he might\r\ngradually lead them into the wake of the squadron. All he got for this\r\nimpudently gallant attempt was a volley of bad language and another of\r\nshot.\r\n\r\nBut all Monson’s exploits pale before an action which occurred in Cerimbra\r\nroads, in which a great treasure-ship was cut out, in sight of a fortress\r\nand eleven galleys, and within hearing of the guns of Lisbon. He was then\r\nassociated with Admiral Sir Richard Lewson, but the principal part of the\r\nservice was performed by himself. When the carrack and galleys were\r\ndiscovered lying at anchor, a council was held on board the admiral’s\r\nvessel, which occupied the better part of a day, as many of the captains\r\nthought it folly to attempt to capture a great ship defended by a fortress\r\nand eleven galleys. Monson thought differently, and it was at length\r\nagreed that he and the admiral should anchor as near the carrack as they\r\ncould, while the other and smaller vessels should ply up and down, holding\r\nthemselves in readiness for any emergency. It is likely, as Southey\r\nremarks, that “the sight of these galleys reminded Sir William of the\r\nslavery he had endured at Lisbon in similar vessels, if not indeed in some\r\nof these identical craft, and he longed to take revenge upon them.” Monson\r\nsays that in order to show contempt of them, he separated from the rest of\r\nthe fleet, by way of challenging and defying them. “The Marquis of St.\r\nCruz, General of the Portuguese, and Frederick Spinola, General of the\r\ngalleys, accepted the invitation, and put out with the intention of\r\nfighting him; but they were diverted from their purpose by a renegade\r\nEnglishman, who knew the force of the vice-admiral’s ship, and that she\r\nwas commanded by Monson.”\r\n\r\nThe town of Cerimbra lies at the bottom of a roadstead, which usually\r\naffords protection for shipping. It had at that time a strong fortress\r\nclose to the beach, and a fortified castle, while there was a troop of\r\nsoldiers ashore, whose numerous tents lined the coast. The galleys were\r\npartly covered or flanked by a neck of rock, and the batteries could play\r\nover them, thus affording them great protection, while they could\r\nthemselves keep up a continuous fire at any approaching vessel. Again,\r\nMonson tells us, “there was no man but imagined that most of the carrack’s\r\nlading was ashore, and that they would hale her aground under the castle\r\nwhere no ship of ours would be able to come at her—all which objections,\r\nwith many more, were alleged, yet they little prevailed. Procrastination\r\nwas perilous, and therefore, with all expedition, they thought convenient\r\nto charge the town, the fort, the galleys, and carrack, all at one\r\ninstant.” This was done next morning, although a gale sprung up about the\r\ntime of the attack. The admiral weighed, fired the signal gun, hoisted his\r\nflag, and was the first at the attack; “after him followed the rest of the\r\nships, showing great valour, and gaining great honour. The last of all was\r\nMonson himself, who, entering into the fight, still strove to get up as\r\nnear the shore as he could, where he came to an anchor, continually\r\nfighting with the town, the fort, the galleys, and the carrack all\r\ntogether; for he brought them betwixt him, that he might play both his\r\nbroadsides upon them. The galleys still kept their prows towards him. The\r\nslaves offered to forsake them ... and everything was in confusion amongst\r\nthem; and thus they fought till five of the clock in the afternoon.”\r\nMonson’s stratagems and rapidity of action paralysed the commanders of the\r\ngalleys, and the men rowed about wildly to avoid him, not knowing what to\r\ndo. The admiral came on board his ship, and, embracing him in the presence\r\nof the ship’s company, declared that “he had won his heart for ever.”\r\n\r\nAnd so the battle raged till the enemy showed such evident signs of\r\nweakness, that it was proposed to board the carrack. Here, however, the\r\nadmiral interposed, as he wished to preserve the treasure on board. The\r\nships were ordered to cease firing, and one Captain Sewell, who had been\r\nfour years a prisoner on the galleys, from one of which he had only just\r\nescaped by swimming, was selected to parley with them. He was to promise\r\nhonourable conditions, but insist that as the English held the roadstead,\r\nas several of the galleys were _hors de combat_, and the castle powerless,\r\nthey must expect the worst in a case of refusal. The captain of the\r\ncarrack would not treat with an officer who had so recently been a slave\r\nin their power, but sent a deputation of Portuguese gentlemen of quality,\r\ndesiring that they should be met by those of similar rank in the English\r\nservice. They were, of course, properly received, but having delivered\r\ntheir message, evinced a great desire to hasten back; they revealed the\r\nreal state of affairs by admitting that it was a moot question on the\r\ncarrack whether the parley ought to be entertained, or the vessel set on\r\nfire. Monson’s promptitude once more saved the situation. Not waiting to\r\nhear any more, or receiving any instruction from Admiral Lewson, he\r\nordered his men to row him to the carrack. Several officers on board\r\nrecognised him, and the commander, Don Diego Lobo, a young man of family,\r\nmotioning his men apart, received him courteously. After some little\r\npalaver, Monson informing Don Diego of the rank he held in the expedition,\r\nand assuring him of his high regard for the Portuguese nation, the real\r\nbusiness of their interview was approached. Diego asked that he, his\r\nofficers and men, should be put on shore that night; that the ship and its\r\nordnance should be respected, and its flags remain suspended; the treasure\r\nhe would concede to the victors. Monson agreed to the first proposition,\r\nexcepting only that he required a certain number of hostages whom he would\r\ndetain three days, but laughed at the idea of separating the ship and its\r\ncontents; and stated that “he was resolved never to permit a Spanish flag\r\nto be worn in the presence of the Queen’s ships, unless it were\r\ndisgracefully over the poop.” A long discussion followed, and Monson, who\r\nwas determined to have his way, made a show of descending to his boat. His\r\nfirmness won the day, and all his demands were eventually conceded, after\r\nwhich he conducted Don Diego and eight gentlemen on board his ship, “when\r\nthey supped, had a variety of music, and spent the night in great\r\njollity.” This is Monson’s account; it is doubtful whether the Portuguese\r\nwere thoroughly enjoying themselves under the circumstances! When next day\r\nSir William accompanied them on shore, he found the Count de Vidigueira at\r\nthe head of a force numbering 20,000 men, whose services were not of much\r\naccount now. The disgust ashore at the comparatively easy victory attained\r\nby the English may be imagined. Besides the capture of the carrack, two of\r\nthe galleys were burnt and sunk; the captain of another was taken\r\nprisoner, and the others fled during the engagement, although they were\r\nafterwards shamed into returning by the heroic behaviour of Spinola, who\r\ndefended the carrack against desperate odds. The total loss of life in the\r\ntown, castle, and vessels, although never accurately known, must have been\r\nimmense, while the victory was purchased by the English with the loss of\r\nonly six men, scarcely a larger number being wounded.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: ACTION IN CERIMBRA ROADS.]\r\n\r\nThe carrack, named the _St. Valentine_, was a vessel of 1,700 tons\r\nburthen; she had wintered at Mozambique on her return from the Indies,\r\nwhere a fatal malady killed the bulk of her crew; indeed, it is stated\r\nthat out of more than 600 men scarce twenty survived the whole voyage. The\r\nViceroy of Portugal sent the galleys before named to protect her, and put\r\non board 400 volunteers. The value of this prize was close on £200,000. It\r\nis just to Monson to state that he offered Diego “permission to take out\r\nof her whatever portion of the freight he could conscientiously claim as\r\nhis own.” This proposal the proud young commander declined. His life\r\nafterwards was a series of misfortunes. He was thrown into prison for\r\nlosing the carrack; escaped from captivity only to languish an exile in\r\nItaly; and at last died just as fortune once more seemed to smile upon him\r\nby offering him a chance in his own king’s service.\r\n\r\nOn the accession of James I. a general peace ensued so far as England was\r\nconcerned. All in all, the rest was beneficial to the navy, and many\r\ndefects were remedied and reforms inaugurated. In one of the earliest\r\nreports presented to the king on the condition of the navy, after\r\nenumerating certain pressing needs, we find the estimate for its _annual_\r\nexpenditure placed at rather less than £21,000—an amount which a single\r\nironclad would have swallowed up entirely, and got considerably into debt.\r\nJames caused one fine vessel to be constructed, in 1610, in which every\r\nimprovement known at the time was introduced. She was christened the\r\n_Prince Royal_. Stow describes her as follows:—“This year the king builded\r\na most goodly ship for warre, the keel whereof was 114 feet in length, and\r\nthe cross beam was forty-four feet in length; she will carry sixty-four\r\npieces of ordnance, and is of the burthen of 1,400 tons. This royal ship\r\nis double built, and is most sumptuously adorned, within and without, with\r\nall manner of curious carving, painting, and rich gilding, being in all\r\nrespects the greatest and goodliest ship that ever was builded in England;\r\nand this glorious ship the king gave to his son Henry, Prince of Wales;\r\nand the 24th September, the king, the queen, the Prince of Wales, the Duke\r\nof York, and the Lady Elizabeth, with many great lords, went unto Woolwich\r\nto see it launched; but because of the narrowness of the dock it could not\r\nthen be launched; whereupon the prince came the next morning by three\r\no’clock, and then at the launching thereof the prince named it after his\r\nown dignity, and called it the _Prince_.” Phineas Pett, one of a family of\r\nleading naval constructors of those days, was its builder. A well-known\r\nauthority(4) says, “Were the absurd profusion of ornament with which the\r\n_Royal Prince_ is decorated removed, its contour or general appearance\r\nwould not so materially differ from the modern vessel of the same size as\r\nto render it an uncommon sight, or a ship in which mariners would hesitate\r\nat proceeding to sea in, on account of any glaring defects in its form,\r\nthat in their opinion might render it unsafe to undertake a common voyage\r\nin.” A very large number of superior vessels were added to the royal navy\r\nduring this epoch, but the commercial marine was in a bad way until late\r\nin James’s reign. What its conviction was at this time may be gathered\r\nfrom the fact that in 1615, half way in the reign, there were not more\r\nthan ten vessels of 200 tons burthen each in the port of London. Less than\r\nseven years afterwards, such was the improvement, that Newcastle alone\r\ncould boast more than a hundred, each of which exceeded that tonnage.\r\n\r\nDuring this peaceful epoch Monson had to fulfil an unthankful office as\r\nguardian of the narrow seas, _i.e._, the English and Irish Channels, and\r\nadjacent waters. He had to transport princes and ambassadors while war was\r\ngoing on, and as it would seem from a paper included in his “Tracts,” at\r\nhis own expense. This document runs at a first glimpse very curiously.\r\nTake one entry, “1604, August 4. The constable of Castile at his coming\r\nover, 200 (followers) 3 (meals).” An unconscionable number of followers\r\nand very few meals, it would seem, for so many; but it doubtless means\r\nthree meals apiece on the passage from Calais or Dunkirk to Dover. The\r\nretinue of “followers” sometimes aggregated as many as 300. During this\r\nperiod, however, Monson made some careful notes on the Dutch fisheries,\r\nthen a most important source of revenue to that nation, while ours were\r\nalmost entirely overlooked. Nine thousand Dutch vessels were kept in\r\nconstant employment by these fisheries, a considerable proportion of which\r\nwere on our own coasts, and conducted under our very noses. He was\r\nemployed at intervals for two years in combating similar encroachments on\r\nthe part of French fishermen. “The adventurous spirit of the age,” says\r\nSouthey, “was averse to an employment so tranquil and so near home.” Men\r\nwould rather seek the uttermost parts of the earth in a vain search for\r\nwealth than settle down to a certain, safe, and profitable employment.\r\nMonson waxes eloquently indignant on the subject in one of his chapters.\r\n“My meaning is,” he says, “not to leave our fruitful soil untilled, our\r\nseas unfrequented, our islands unpeopled, or to seek remote and strange\r\ncountries disinhabited, and uncivil Indians untamed, where nothing appears\r\nto us but earth, wood, and water, at our first arrival; for all other hope\r\nmust depend on our labour and costly expenses, on the adventures of the\r\nsea, on the honesty of undertakers; and all these at last produce nothing\r\nbut tobacco(5)—a new-invented useless weed, as too much use and custom\r\nmake it apparent. * * * * You shall be made to know, that though you be\r\nborn on an island seated in the ocean, frequented by invisible fish,\r\nswimming from one shore to the other, yet your experience has not taught\r\nyou the benefits and blessings arising from that fish. I doubt not but to\r\ngive you that light therein, that you shall confess yourselves blinded,\r\nand be willing to blow from you the foul mist that has been an impediment\r\nto your sight; you shall be awakened from your drowsy sleep, and rouse\r\nyourselves to follow this best business that ever was presented to\r\nEngland, or king thereof; nay, I will be bold to say, to any state in the\r\nworld. I will not except the discoveries of the West Indies by Columbus;\r\nan act of greatest renown, of greatest profit, and that has been of\r\ngreatest consequence to the Spanish nation.” Exaggerated as all this may\r\nappear, Monson was right in his estimation of the profitable nature of the\r\nbusiness. At that time the Dutch used to vend their fish in every European\r\nmarket, and obtain in exchange the productions of all countries. Monson\r\nalso remarks on the carelessness of the English at that time in regard to\r\nlobsters, oysters, and lampreys, all of which the Dutch obtained from our\r\ncoasts. In order to encourage the fisheries an Act had been passed\r\nprohibiting butchers from killing meat in Lent, and Monson wished it to be\r\nmade compulsory on the rural population to consume fish. “Neither,” says\r\nhe, “will it seem a thing unreasonable to enjoin every yeoman and farmer\r\nwithin the kingdom to take a barrel of fish for their own spending,\r\nconsidering they save the value thereof in other victuals; and that it is\r\nno more than the fisherman will do to them to take off their wheat, malt,\r\nbutter, and cheese for their food to sea.” This agitation did good in\r\ncalling attention to a neglected industry. The great enemies of the\r\nfishermen then were the pirates who infested the coasts, and who, if they\r\nran short of provisions, looked upon them as their natural providers,\r\nrarely, if ever, paying for what they took. And before passing to other\r\nsubjects, let us accompany Monson—on paper—on a little expedition he took\r\nagainst some of the said pirates.\r\n\r\nSo considerable an amount of alarm had been caused by piratical\r\nadventurers on the coasts of Scotland, that King James was in 1614\r\nurgently requested to send some royal ships there. Sir William Monson and\r\nSir Francis Howard were despatched at once, and after calling at Leith to\r\nobtain information and also the service of pilots, proceeded to the Orkney\r\nIslands. Touching at Sinclair Castle, the residence of the Earl of\r\nCaithness, situate on “the utmost promontory” of Britain, they learned\r\nthat the accounts had been much exaggerated. There were only two known to\r\nthe Earl, and indeed one of them whom Monson took could hardly be deemed\r\nsuch at all; he was a common sailor, and when he had found out the nature\r\nof the service to which he had been engaged, he had abandoned it as soon\r\nas possible. Clarke, the other adventurer, to whom the title of pirate\r\nmore fairly belonged, had been ashore to the castle a day previously, and\r\nhad been entertained in a friendly way, the fact being that the Earl and\r\nhis tenants were a little afraid of him as an ugly customer. Hearing that\r\nSir William was on the coast, he had fled: Monson, therefore, finding it\r\nuseless and needless to remain at Caithness, sailed for Orkney, where he\r\nleft Sir Francis Howard while he proceeded to explore the coasts in\r\ndetail, putting into every inlet where it was likely Clarke or other\r\npirates might be hidden. He was unsuccessful in his search, and at length\r\ndecided to make for Broad Haven—a noted rendezvous for pirates—partly on\r\naccount of its remoteness and inaccessibility, and partly because one\r\nCormat dwelt there, who, with his daughters, entertained these thieving\r\nadventurers with great cordiality. On the voyage he encountered a terrible\r\ngale, “that it were fit only for a poet to describe.” One of his vessels\r\nwas engulfed in the seas, and no traces of it or of its crew remained,\r\nwhile the others were dispersed and did not see each other again till all\r\nmet in England. Monson had now alone to beard the lion in his den.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: MONSON AT BROAD HAVEN.]\r\n\r\nArrived at Broad Haven, which he describes as “the well-head of all\r\npirates,” he made good use of the half-pirate he had secured, the only\r\nperson on board who knew anything of that den of sea-thieves. This man,\r\nwith some others of the crew who had had some experience in piratical\r\npursuits before, were sent to Cormat, “the gentleman of the place,” with a\r\nwell concocted story. Monson was described, for the nonce, as one Captain\r\nManwaring, a grand sea-rover, liberal to all he liked, and whose ship was\r\nfull of wealth. “To give a greater appearance of truth to all this, the\r\ncrafty messenger used the names of several pirates of his acquaintance,\r\nand feigned messages to the women from their sweethearts, making them\r\nbelieve that he had tokens from them on board. The hope of wealth and\r\nreward set the hearts of the whole family on fire; and the women were so\r\noverjoyed by the love tales and presents, that no suspicion of deceit\r\nentered into their minds.” Cormat proffered his services, and recounted\r\nhow many pirates he had assisted, at great peril to himself; he further\r\nvolunteered to send two “gentlemen of trust” on board next day, as\r\nhostages for his sincerity. He recommended that some of them should come\r\nashore next day, armed, and kill some of the neighbours’ cattle; this was\r\nintended doubtless to frighten the poor settlers round, so that he himself\r\nmight derive all the benefit of Manwaring’s visit. Next morning the farce\r\nbegan, the first part of the programme being followed as Cormat had\r\ndirected; Captain Chester, with fifty men, was despatched ashore by\r\nMonson; some cattle were killed, and the pseudo-pirates, swaggering and\r\nrollicking, were invited to Cormat’s house, where they received a riotous\r\nwelcome. Cormat’s two ambassadors went on board Monson’s vessel, and\r\ndelivered a friendly message. When they had delivered it, Sir William\r\ndesired them to observe everything around them carefully, and to tell him\r\nwhether they thought that ship and company were pirates. It was idle to\r\ndissemble any longer, especially as these men could not, if they would,\r\nbetray Sir William’s design. He accordingly reproached them for their\r\ntransgressions, told them to prepare for death, and ordered them to be put\r\nin irons, taking care that neither boat nor man should be allowed to go on\r\nshore until he was ready to land. When he at length went ashore to visit\r\nCormat, four or five hundred people had assembled on the beach to receive\r\nthe famous “Captain Manwaring.” He pretended to be doubtful of their\r\nintentions, when they redoubled their protestations of friendship, three\r\nof the principal men running into the water up to their arm-pits, striving\r\nwho should have the honour of carrying him ashore. One of these was an\r\nIrish merchant, who did a thriving trade with the pirates; another was a\r\nschoolmaster; and the third was an Englishman, who had formerly been a\r\ntradesman in London. These gentry conducted Sir William to Cormat’s house\r\namidst huzzas and shouts of welcome, everybody seeking to ingratiate\r\nhimself with the supposed pirate. “‘Happy was he,’ says Monson, ‘to whom\r\nhe would lend his ear.’ Falling into discourse, one told him they knew his\r\nfriends, and though his name had not discovered it, yet his face did show\r\nhim to be a Manwaring.” In short, they made him believe he might command\r\nthem and their country, and that no man ever was so welcome as Captain\r\nManwaring. At the house a scene of revelry ensued; the harper played\r\nmerrily for the company, who danced on the floor, which had been newly\r\nstrewed with rushes for the occasion. The women made endless inquiries for\r\ntheir distant lovers, and no suspicion seems to have crossed the minds of\r\nany in regard to the fate of the two ambassadors, who were supposed to be\r\nenjoying themselves with the sailors on board. In the height of the\r\nfestivities, the Englishman was particularly communicative; showed Sir\r\nWilliam a pass for the interior which he had obtained by false pretences\r\nfrom the sheriff, authorising him to travel from Clare to make inquisition\r\nfor goods supposed to have been lost at sea, and which enabled him to\r\njourney and sell his plunder without suspicion. He even proffered the\r\nservices of ten mariners who were hiding in the neighbourhood, and Monson,\r\nof course, pretended heartily to accept their services, promising a\r\nreward. He asked the man to write them a letter, which at once he did as\r\nfollows:—“Honest brother Dick and the rest, we are all made men, for\r\nvaliant Captain Manwaring and all his gallant crew are arrived in this\r\nplace. Make haste, for he flourisheth in wealth, and is most kind to all\r\nmen. Farewell, and once again make haste.” Monson took charge of the\r\nletter, and would, doubtless, have used it, had not the approach of night\r\nobliged him to bring about the _denouement_ of this play. The comedy was\r\nall at once to change into a tragedy.\r\n\r\nIn the midst of their riotous mirth, he suddenly desired the harper to\r\ncease, and in serious and solemn tones commanded silence. He told them\r\nthat, hitherto, “they had played their part, and he had no share in the\r\ncomedy; but though his was last, and might be termed the epilogue, yet it\r\nwould prove more tragical than theirs.” He undeceived them as to his being\r\na pirate, and declared his real business was to punish and suppress all\r\nsuch, whom his Majesty did not think worthy the name of subjects. “There\r\nnow remained nothing but to proceed to their executions, by virtue of his\r\ncommission; for which purpose he had brought a gallows ready framed, which\r\nhe caused to be set up, intending to begin the mournful dance with the two\r\nmen they thought had been merry-making aboard the ship. As to the\r\nEnglishman, he should come next, because being an Englishman his offence\r\ndid surpass the rest. He told the schoolmaster he was a fit tutor for the\r\nchildren of the devil, and that as members are governed by the head, the\r\nway to make his members sound was to shorten him by the head, and\r\ntherefore willed him to admonish his scholars from the top of the gallows,\r\nwhich should be a pulpit prepared for him. He condemned the merchant as a\r\nreceiver of stolen goods, and worse than the thief himself; reminding him\r\nthat his time was not long, and hoping that he might make his account with\r\nGod, and that he might be found a good merchant and factor to Him, though\r\nhe had been a malefactor to the law.” One can imagine the change which\r\ncame over the assembly; all their high spirits were quenched in a minute,\r\nwhile the principals abandoned themselves to despair, believing that their\r\nhour was at hand. When Sir William left them to go aboard, the carpenter\r\nwas still hammering away at the gallows.\r\n\r\nNext morning the prisoners were brought out to meet their doom, and were\r\nkept waiting in an agony of terror, while the people generally were sueing\r\nfor their lives, and promising that they would never assist or connive at\r\npirates again. Sir William had never really the intention to hang any of\r\nthem, and “after four-and-twenty hours’ fright in irons he pardoned them;”\r\nthe Englishman being the only one who suffered any actual punishment. He\r\nwas banished from the coast, and the sheriff was admonished to be more\r\ncareful in granting passes for the future.\r\n\r\nThe very next day, while still at Broad Haven, Sir William nearly captured\r\na pirate who was entering the harbour, when the latter took alarm at\r\nseeing a strange vessel, and stood off to sea, where he remained six days\r\nin foul weather. A day later the pirate anchored at an island near Broad\r\nHaven, and contrived to forward a letter to Cormat, who having just\r\nescaped one danger, did not desire to risk his neck again; he accordingly\r\nshowed the letter to Monson. It ran as follows:—“Dear Friend, I was\r\nbearing into Broad Haven to give you corn for ballast, but I was\r\nfrightened by the king’s ship I supposed to be there. I pray you send me\r\nword what ship it is, for we stand in great fear. I pray you, provide me\r\ntwo kine, for we are in great want of victuals; whensoever you shall make\r\na fire on shore, I will send my boat to you.” This just suited Monson, who\r\nhad a particular aptitude for stratagem. He directed Cormat to answer his\r\nrequest in the affirmative. “He bid him be confident this ship could not\r\nendanger him; for she was not the king’s, as he imagined, but one of\r\nLondon that came from the Indies with her men sick, and many dead. He\r\npromised him two oxen and a calf; to observe his directions by making a\r\nfire; and gave him hope to see him within two nights.” A few of the ship’s\r\ncompany, disguised in Irish costumes of the period, were sent to accompany\r\nthe messenger, with instructions to remain in ambush. The hungry pirates\r\nwere keeping a sharp look out for the beacon fire, and it was no sooner\r\nlighted, than they hastily rowed ashore, and received the letter, which\r\ngave them great satisfaction. Sir William meanwhile was quietly laying\r\nplans for their capture. Guided by the Irish peasantry, he took a number\r\nof his company a roundabout trip by land and water till he brought them\r\nsuddenly upon the place where the fire was made, and the pirates were\r\ntaken so unawares that they yielded without an effort to escape. The whole\r\ngang was seized and taken to Broad Haven, where the captain was hanged as\r\nan example to the rest. Monson so completely cleared the coast of pirates,\r\nand frightened those who had aided them, that on his way home, “groping\r\nalong the coast,” he could not obtain a pilot. Monson’s active career,\r\nalthough it extended to the reign of Charles I., was now nearly over.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE HISTORY OF SHIPS AND SHIPPING INTERESTS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n    Charles I. and Ship Money—Improvements made by him in the Navy—His\r\n         great Ship, the _Royal Sovereign_—The Navigation Laws of\r\n     Cromwell—Consequent War with the Dutch—Capture of Grand Spanish\r\n    Prizes—Charles II. seizes 130 Dutch Ships—Van Tromp and the Action\r\n       at Harwich—De Ruyter in the Medway and Thames—Peace—War with\r\n      France—La Hogue—Peter the Great and his Naval Studies—Visit to\r\n    Sardam—Difficulty of remaining _incognito_—Cooks his own Food—His\r\n     Assiduity and Earnestness—A kind-hearted Barbarian—Gives a Grand\r\n       Banquet and _Fête_—Conveyed to England—His Stay at Evelyn’s\r\n      Place—Studies at Deptford—Visits Palaces and Public Houses—His\r\n     Intemperance—Presents the King a £10,000 Ruby—Engages numbers of\r\n         English Mechanics—Return to Russia—Rapid increase in his\r\n      Navy—Determines to Build St. Petersburg—Arrivals of the First\r\n    Merchantmen—Splendid Treatment of their Captains—Law’s Mississippi\r\n    Scheme and the South Sea Bubble—Two Nations gone Mad—The “Bubble”\r\n    to Pay the National Debt—Its one Solitary Ship—Noble and Plebeian\r\n        Stockbrokers—Rise and Fall of the Bubble—Directors made to\r\n                                Disgorge.\r\n\r\n\r\nCharles I., as we all know, had a fatal amount of belief in the royal\r\nprerogative. One of his first acts, after ascending the throne, was to\r\nassume the direct government of Virginia, and not only to treat the\r\ncharter of the company as annulled, “but broadly declared that colonies\r\nfounded by adventurers, or occupied by British subjects, were essentially\r\npart and parcel of the dominion of the mother country.” The Virginia\r\nCompany vainly complained that they had expended a fifth of a million\r\nsterling over the undertaking; their territory was appropriated to the\r\nCrown, as were shortly afterwards North and South Carolina, Georgia,\r\nTennessee, and part of Louisiana. But these arbitrary acts were as nothing\r\nto the ship-money tax. There was some precedent for it. “The ancient\r\nprinces of England, as they called on the inhabitants of the counties near\r\nScotland to arm and array themselves for the defence of the border, had\r\nsometimes called on the maritime counties to furnish ships for the defence\r\nof the coast. In the room of ships, money had sometimes been accepted.\r\nThis old practice it was now determined, after a long interval, not only\r\nto revive but to extend. Former princes had raised ship-money only in time\r\nof war; it was now exacted in a time of profound peace. Former princes,\r\neven in the most perilous wars, had raised ship-money only along the\r\ncoasts; it was now exacted from the inland shires. Former princes had\r\nraised ship-money only for the maritime defence of the country; it was now\r\nexacted, by the admission of the Royalists themselves, with the object,\r\nnot of maintaining a navy, but of furnishing the king with supplies which\r\nmight be increased at his discretion to any amount, and expended at his\r\ndiscretion for any purpose.”(6) The resistance which followed, and which\r\nassisted the unfortunate monarch to his downfall, is too well known to\r\nneed recapitulation here. Worthy Monson, who, although bluff and hearty\r\nenough as a sailor, was something of a courtier, defended the levy of the\r\nobnoxious tax. But then he believed that Charles really wanted the money\r\nfor the navy alone, and for retaliation upon the Dutch, while the nation\r\nat large had not much faith in their king, or in the alleged purposes for\r\nwhich the tax was to be levied. This is not the place for any defence,\r\npartial or otherwise, of Charles’s policy. He did, however, show a\r\nconsiderable amount of energy in his attempts to improve the navy, and\r\nconstructed one vessel, the _Sovereign of the Seas_, or _Royal Sovereign_,\r\nwhich was in every respect an advance on anything built before it. One\r\nThomas Heywood wrote a very learned and flowery tract concerning it.\r\n“There is one thing” says he, “above all things for the world to take\r\nspeciall notice of, that shee is beside tonnage so many tons in burden, as\r\ntheir have beene yeares since our blessed Saviour’s incarnation, namely,\r\n1637, and not one under or over; a most happy omen, which, though it was\r\nnot the first projected or intended, is now by true computation found so\r\nto happen.” A description of her ornamentation would occupy several pages\r\nof this work; gold and black were the colours alone employed. She was 232\r\nfeet long, had three flush decks, besides quarter-deck and raised\r\nforecastle. “Her lower tyre” had thirty ports; her middle tier the same;\r\nand the third, twenty-six ports for guns. Her forecastle, half-deck,\r\nstern, and bows were all pierced for heavy guns—that is, heavy for those\r\ndays. On the stern was painted a Latin inscription, thus “Englisht,” as\r\nHeywood puts it:—\r\n\r\n  “He who seas, windes, and navies doth protect,\r\n  Great Charles, thy great ship in her course direct!”\r\n\r\nShe was built of the best oak, and no more seaworthy ship had ever been\r\nturned out from Woolwich previously. _The Royal Prince_, built only\r\nnineteen years before, seems to have been a mere holiday ship, and was at\r\nthe above-mentioned date laid up; the _Royal Sovereign_ was in active\r\nservice for nearly sixty years, and would have been rebuilt but for an\r\nuntoward accident. The history and fate of this fine ship are thus briefly\r\ndescribed by a descendant of the architect, Phineas Pett, writing in\r\nJanuary, 1696:—\r\n\r\n“The _Royal Sovereign_ was the first great ship that was ever built in\r\nEngland; she was then designed only for splendour and magnificence, and\r\nwas in some measure the occasion of those loud complaints against\r\nship-money in the reign of Charles I.; but being taken down a deck lower,\r\nshe became one of the best men-of-war in the world, and so formidable to\r\nher enemies that none of the most daring among them would willingly lie by\r\nher side. She had been in almost all the great engagements that had been\r\nfought between France and Holland; and in the last fight between the\r\nEnglish and the French, encountering the _Wonder of the World_, she so\r\nwarmly plied the French Admiral, that she forced him out of his\r\nthree-decked wooden castle, and chasing the _Royal Sun_ before her, forced\r\nher to fly for shelter among the rocks, where she became a prey to lesser\r\nvessels, that reduced her to ashes. At length, leaky and defective herself\r\nwith age, she was laid up at Chatham to be rebuilt; but being set on fire\r\nby negligence, she was, on the 27th of this month, devoured by the element\r\nwhich so long and so often before she had imperiously made use of as the\r\ninstrument of destruction to others.”\r\n\r\nCharles, in spite of his troubles, either rebuilt or added eighteen\r\nvessels to the Royal Navy, leaving it not merely numerically stronger, but\r\nimproved in all other particulars. The immense square sterns and full bows\r\noriginally copied from the Dutch (who built their ships apparently on\r\ntheir own model) gave place to more shapely sterns and sharper bows.\r\nExtremely high poops and forecastles—copied, one would think, from the\r\nChinese—were abandoned as increasing the dangers of seamanship. Tonnage\r\nand number of guns were largely increased. A “first rate” advanced from\r\nfifty to sixty, and afterwards to a hundred guns.\r\n\r\nHolland, during the reigns of James I. and Charles I., had been carrying\r\noff all the commercial honours from England, and it was becoming evident\r\nthat prohibitory laws were needed to stop their triumphant progress on the\r\nsea. In 1646, and again in 1650, two Acts were passed, both having the\r\nsame tendency, to prevent foreign ships trading with England’s new\r\nplantations in Virginia, Bermuda, Barbadoes, “and other places in\r\nAmerica.”(7) On the 9th of October, 1651, the celebrated Navigation Act of\r\nCromwell came into operation. There were no half measures in that Act. It\r\ndeclared that no goods or commodities whatever of the growth, production,\r\nor manufacture of Asia, Africa, or America, should be imported either into\r\nGreat Britain or Ireland, or any of the colonies, except in _British-built\r\nships, owned by British subjects, and of which the master and\r\nthree-fourths of the crew belonged to that country_. This, literally\r\ntranslated, meant that England wanted the carrying trade of everything\r\nthat concerned her own well being. The next enactment went further. It\r\nprovided that no goods of the growth, production, or manufacture of any\r\ncountry in Europe should be imported into Great Britain except in British\r\nships, owned and navigated by British subjects, “_or in such ships as were\r\nthe real property of the people of the country or place in which the goods\r\nwere produced, or from which they could only be, or most usually were,\r\nexported_.” This provision was aimed at the Dutch; they had little to\r\nexport. But unless one can understand the long-stifled animosity and\r\njealousy felt in England regarding their commercial supremacy on the seas,\r\nand as regards the carrying trade, he can hardly understand why laws,\r\nwhich would nowadays be considered ridiculous and unjust, were so popular\r\nthen. So strong had these feelings become, that when the Dutch despatched\r\nan embassy to England for the purpose of obtaining a revocation of the\r\nnavigation laws, its members had to be guarded from the violence of the\r\nmob.\r\n\r\nEngland had now unmistakably asserted her right to carry on her own\r\nover-sea trade in her own ships, and to enter the lists with any other\r\nnation as regards foreign trade. This action was a defiance hurled at\r\nHolland, and after a little manœuvring ended inevitably in war. A few\r\nfacts only regarding that war may be permitted here. The Dutch were at\r\nfirst, and indeed for the most part, the sufferers. Within a month of its\r\ndeclaration, Blake captured 100 of their herring boats, and twelve of\r\ntheir frigates, sinking a thirteenth. In 1652-3 there were five actions.\r\nIn the first Blake was successful; in the second he was thoroughly beaten\r\nby Martin Tromp (father of the Tromp best known in history). The third,\r\nearly in 1653, resulted in a victory for the English, the Dutch losing 300\r\nmerchantmen they had captured not long before; the fourth was a decided\r\nvictory for England, and the fifth was an indecisive action. The English,\r\nhowever, took possession of the Channel, and scarcely a day passed without\r\nDutch prizes being brought into English ports. Many of the Dutch ships,\r\nreturning from distant parts of the world, rounded Scotland, rather than\r\npass up the Channel. On the fifth of April, 1654, a treaty of peace was\r\nconcluded; Cromwell requiring, before it was signed, an admission of the\r\nEnglish sovereignty of the seas, and the Dutch consenting to strike their\r\nflag to the ships of the Commonwealth.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest maritime successes of the Protector’s time was the\r\ncapture of Spanish galleons worth, with their freight, £600,000. The fleet\r\nhad been lying idly off Cadiz endeavouring to provoke the Spanish squadron\r\nto an engagement, or trusting to intercept their returning treasure ships.\r\nCaptain Stayner in the _Speaker_, accompanied by the _Bridgewater_ and\r\n_Plymouth_, left the English fleet temporarily with the intention of\r\ntaking water on board in a neighbouring bay. On his course he luckily fell\r\nin with eight galleons from America. Such an opportunity warmed up the\r\nhitherto drooping spirits of the English sailors, and they fought with\r\nfury. In a few hours one of the galleons was sunk, a second burned, two\r\nashore, and four taken prizes. They were loaded with plate, ore, and\r\nmoney. When the treasure reached London it was placed in open carts and\r\nammunition wagons, and carried in triumph through the streets to the\r\nTower, with a guard of only _ten_ soldiers. This rather ostentatious\r\ndisplay of confidence in the people proved an excellent move for Cromwell;\r\nnothing added more to his popularity among the lower classes. The Earl of\r\nMontague, who convoyed it home, but who in reality had nothing to do with\r\nits capture, was the subject of universal panegyrics and parliamentary\r\nthanks.\r\n\r\nIf Charles II. could have reversed any of Cromwell’s legislative measures,\r\nhe and his court would most assuredly have done so. But they were simply\r\nmodified, and not to the advantage of the Dutch, who were very much\r\nirritated, but attempted to gain time. Charles, however, without waiting\r\nfor a formal declaration of hostilities, seized 130 of their ships laden\r\nwith wine and brandy, homeward bound from Bordeaux, which were taken into\r\nEnglish ports, and condemned as lawful prizes, although such an act could\r\nnot be justified by any law of nations. War was again declared in 1665,\r\nand an action occurred off Harwich, in which the celebrated Van Tromp was\r\nengaged. The Dutch lost nineteen ships, burnt or sunk, with probably 6,000\r\nmen; the English lost only four vessels, and about 1,500 men. Then came a\r\ncoalition between the French and Dutch, and the great battle of June 1st,\r\n1666, in which England lost two admirals, and twenty-three great ships,\r\nbesides smaller vessels, 6,000 men, and 2,600 prisoners; and the Dutch\r\nfour admirals, six ships, and 2,800 soldiers. The Dutch could fairly claim\r\nthe victory here, but less than eight weeks later, July 24th, were\r\nthoroughly beaten, De Ruyter being driven into port, and a large number of\r\nmerchant ships and two men-of-war being taken immediately afterwards.\r\nWhile negotiations were going on for peace next year, the Dutch, believing\r\nCharles to be trifling, despatched De Ruyter to the Thames. All London was\r\nin a panic. A strong chain had been thrown across the Medway, but the\r\nDutch, with favourable wind and strong tide, broke through it, destroyed\r\nthe fortifications of Sheerness, burnt royal and merchant ships, and\r\npushed up the river as far as Upnor Castle, near Chatham. It was even\r\nfeared that the fleet would sail up to London Bridge, and to prevent it,\r\nthirteen ships were sunk in the river at Woolwich, and four at Blackwall.\r\nNumerous platforms furnished with artillery were hastily prepared at\r\nvarious points. After committing all the damage that he could in the\r\nThames, De Ruyter sailed for Portsmouth, intending to cause similar havoc,\r\nbut finding the fleet well prepared, he passed down the Channel and\r\ncaptured several vessels at Torbay. Thence turning back, he hovered about\r\nhither and thither, keeping the coast in continual alarm until the treaty\r\nof peace was signed in the following summer. By its provisions each nation\r\nretained the goods and prizes it had captured, while all ships of war and\r\nmerchant vessels belonging to the United Provinces meeting our men-of-war\r\nin British waters, were required to “strike the flag and lower the sail as\r\nhad been formerly practised.” From this date the merchant navy of England\r\nsteadily increased, and London became that which Amsterdam had been, the\r\nmart of nations, the chief emporium of the commercial world. In spite of\r\nDe Ruyter, England had therefore greatly gained by this war.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: DE RUYTER ON THE MEDWAY.]\r\n\r\nAnd now France sought to pluck from England the laurels she had won from\r\nthe Dutch. Her naval force had become formidable, and augmented by\r\nprivateers, played havoc with our merchant vessels. By the destruction or\r\ncapture of nearly the whole of our Smyrna fleet, with two English ships of\r\nwar convoying them, and other captures, it was estimated that the loss to\r\nEngland was a million sterling. But May 12th, 1692, brought its revenge.\r\nOn that day the memorable battle of La Hogue was fought, and the French\r\nlost nearly the whole of their navy to us.\r\n\r\nFrom 1688 to the death of Queen Anne, the trade of the American\r\nplantations had steadily and rapidly increased, till at the latter date it\r\nemployed 500 vessels, a large proportion of which were engaged in the\r\nslave trade from Africa. It started as a monopoly in the hands of the\r\nAfrican Company, incorporated at first under Act of Parliament as traders\r\nin gold and ivory, but soon developing into traffickers in human flesh. In\r\n1698 an Act of Parliament gave permission to all the king’s subjects,\r\nwhether of England or America, to trade to Africa on payment of a certain\r\npercentage to the company on all goods exported or imported, negro slaves\r\nbeing, nevertheless, exempted from this tax. How great this inhuman and\r\nnefarious trade had developed may be gathered from the fact that the\r\nFrench, _in one year_, and to supply _one_ island, that of St. Domingo,\r\ntransported 20,000 slaves from Africa.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: PETER THE GREAT.]\r\n\r\nPassing rapidly over the pages of history, we come to an important epoch\r\nin the progress of merchant shipping, when the trade to Russia was\r\npractically thrown open to our merchants by an Act “entitling any person\r\nto admission to the Russia Company upon payment of an entrance fee of five\r\npounds.” It was about this time that the Czar abdicated temporarily, and\r\nmade a voyage to Holland and England, travelling _incognito_, or as much\r\nso as he could. Many popular accounts of Peter the Great’s stay in these\r\ntwo countries are so full of errors that the present writer may be\r\npermitted to give, moderately in detail, some account of them, derived\r\nfrom the best authorities.(8) They have a distinct bearing on our subject,\r\nnot merely because one of Peter’s leading objects was the study of\r\nship-building and maritime affairs, but because his studies led to an\r\nimmense increase in Russia’s naval power. Previously, in fact, she could\r\nhardly be said to have had any at all.\r\n\r\nIn many published accounts the Czar is represented as a mere youth at the\r\nperiod of his visit to the dockyards of Holland and England. The fact is\r\nthat he was twenty-five years of age, and had already served in two\r\ncampaigns. Indeed, it may be said that the latter campaign, in which he\r\nconquered Azoff, partly by the assistance of foreigners and ships built by\r\nforeigners, was the means of opening his eyes to the superiority of the\r\nWestern Europeans over his own barbarous subjects. Resolute, ambitious,\r\nand intelligent, he determined that his people should not remain half\r\nsavages. Influenced by such motives, he dispatched, in 1697, sixty young\r\nRussians, selected out of the army, to Venice and Leghorn, under orders to\r\nmake themselves instructed in everything pertaining to the arts of\r\nship-building and navigation; forty more were sent to Holland for the same\r\npurpose, and his own voyage had largely the same object. “It was a thing,”\r\nsays Voltaire, “unparalleled in history, either ancient or modern, for a\r\nsovereign of five-and-twenty years of age to withdraw from his kingdom for\r\nthe sole purpose of learning the art of government.” It happened that\r\nPeter was not as yet represented at any of the foreign courts, and he\r\ntherefore appointed an embassy extraordinary to proceed, in the first\r\ninstance, to the States-General of Holland, while he would accompany it\r\nsimply in the character of an _attaché_. The three ambassadors were\r\nGeneral Le Fort, a native of Geneva, who had been of immense service to\r\nthe Czar, and was now his confidential friend; Alexis Golowin, Governor of\r\nSiberia; and Voristzin, Secretary of State for Foreign Affairs. With\r\nsecretaries, attachés, pages, and guards, the retinue numbered 200\r\npersons. Their passage through Germany was a grand carouse, and the hard\r\ndrinking for which the Russians are still noted, was very much observed.\r\nAt one of these bacchanalian debauches, the Czar, who was a hot-headed\r\nman, took such violent offence at something said by Le Fort, that he drew\r\nhis sword and ordered him to defend himself. “Far be it from me,” said Le\r\nFort; “rather let me perish by the hand of my master.” Peter had raised\r\nhis arm, but one of the retinue dared to interfere, and caught hold of it.\r\nPeter’s anger was of short duration; he displayed, says Voltaire, “_autant\r\nde regret de cet emportement passager qu’Alexandre en eut du meurtre de\r\nClitus_,” and immediately asked Le Fort’s pardon, saying, “that his great\r\ndesire was to reform his subjects, but he was ashamed to say he had not\r\nyet been able to reform himself.”\r\n\r\nHaving reached Emmerich, the impetuous and youthful monarch left the\r\nembassy, and proceeded in a boat down the Rhine, not halting till he\r\nreached Amsterdam, “through which,” says one authority, “he flew like\r\nlightning, and never once stopped till he arrived at Zardam,(9) fifteen\r\ndays before the embassy reached Amsterdam.” One of his small party in the\r\nboat happened to recognize a man there who was fishing in a boat, as one\r\nKist, who had worked for some time in Russia. He was called to them, and\r\nhis astonishment may be conceived at seeing the Czar of all the Russias in\r\na little boat, dressed like a Dutch skipper, in a red jacket and white\r\ntrousers. Peter told Kist that he should like to lodge with him; the poor\r\nman did not know what to do, but finding the Czar in earnest procured him\r\na cottage behind his own, consisting of two small rooms and a loft. Kist\r\nwas instructed not to let any one know who the new lodger was. A crowd\r\ncollected to stare at the strangers; and to the questions put to them,\r\nPeter used to answer in Dutch that they were all carpenters and labourers\r\nhard up for a job. But the crowd did not believe it, for the dresses of\r\nsome of his companions belied the statement. The Czar, shortly after\r\narriving at Zardam, paid visits to a number of the families of Dutch\r\nseamen and carpenters whom he was employing at Archangel and elsewhere,\r\nrepresenting himself as a brother workman. Among others he called upon a\r\npoor widow, whose deceased husband had once been a skipper in his employ,\r\nand to whom he had some time before sent a present of 500 guilders. The\r\npoor woman begged him to tell the Czar how “she never could be\r\nsufficiently thankful” for his great kindness, little dreaming that the\r\nrough-looking young man before her was that monarch. He assured her that\r\nthe Czar should most certainly be acquainted with her message. Peter\r\nproceeded to purchase a quantity of carpenter’s tools, and his companions\r\nwere ordered to clothe themselves in the common garb worn in the\r\ndockyards.\r\n\r\nNext day was Sunday, and it became evident that some one had let the cat\r\nmore or less out of the bag, for crowds of sailors and dock-hands\r\nassembled before Peter’s lodgings, which annoyed him terribly. But the\r\nfact is that a Dutch resident of Archangel had written home to his\r\nfriends, informing them of the projected voyage, and enclosing a portrait\r\nand description of the Czar. Among the crowd a garrulous barber, who\r\nbelieved he had recognised him, shouted out, “Dat is der Tzar!” and all\r\npoor Peter’s little stratagems could not save him from the curiosity of\r\nthe populace. A Hollander has left a description of him, which would\r\nindicate that he was too noticeable to be mistaken by any who had once\r\nseen him. He was very tall and robust, quick and nimble of foot, and\r\ndexterous and rapid in all his actions; his face was plump and round,\r\nfierce in his look, with brown eyebrows, and short curling hair of a\r\nbrownish colour. His gait was quick, and he had a habit of swinging his\r\narms violently, while he always carried a cane, which he occasionally used\r\nvery freely over the shoulders of those who had offended him. “His\r\nextraordinary rapidity of movement in landing or embarking used to\r\nastonish and amuse the Dutch, who had never before witnessed such\r\n‘_loopen, springen, en klauteren over der schepen_.’”\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: THE IMPERIAL WORKMAN RECEIVING A DEPUTATION.]\r\n\r\nWhen the embassy entered Amsterdam formally, Peter took part in the\r\nprocession, but only as a private gentleman in one of the last carriages,\r\nand he was not recognised. But little of his time was given to the\r\nambassadors; it was almost entirely spent in the docks, among\r\nshipbuilders, and on the shipping, and in sailing about the Zuyder Zee and\r\nelsewhere, where he was accustomed to carry so much sail on his little\r\nboat as to alarm his companions for his safety. “His first exploit in the\r\ndockyard of Mynheer Calf, a wealthy merchant and shipbuilder, with whom he\r\nwas prevailed on to lodge, after quitting his first cabin, was to purchase\r\na small yacht, and to fit her with a new bowsprit, made entirely with his\r\nown hands, to the astonishment of all the shipwrights; they could not\r\nconceive how a person of his high rank could submit to work till the sweat\r\nran down his face, or where he could have learned to handle the tools so\r\ndexterously.” While in the dockyard he was entered in the books as a\r\nship-carpenter, and conformed in every way to its regulations. He was\r\nknown among the workman as Pieter Zimmerman, sometimes as Pieter Bass, or\r\nMaster Peter. Dutch authorities speak of his simple habits; he was an\r\nearly riser, lighted his own fire, and frequently cooked his own food\r\nwhile living in the cottage. When any one wished to speak to him, “he\r\nwould go with his adze in his hand, and sit down on a rough log of timber\r\nfor a short time, but seemed always anxious to resume and finish the work\r\non which he had been employed.” An English nobleman visited the yard, and\r\nasked the superintendent to point out the Czar to him unnoticed. This was\r\ndone, and the superintendent, seeing that the Czar was resting for a\r\nmoment, called out to him, “Pieter Zimmerman, why don’t you assist those\r\nmen?” Peter immediately got up and helped to shoulder the heavy log they\r\nwere carrying. He would lend a helping hand at everything connected with\r\nships, even rope and sail making, and smith’s work. Once, at Müller’s\r\nmanufactory, at Istia, he forged several bars of iron, and put his own\r\nmark on them, making his companions blow the bellows and fetch the coals.\r\nThe Czar insisted upon receiving the same payment as the other workmen,\r\nand bought a pair of shoes with the money, remarking “I have earned them\r\nwell, by the sweat of my brow, with hammer and anvil.” Peter finished his\r\nlabours at ship-carpentering by assisting to put together a yacht, which,\r\nat the suggestion of one of the burgomasters, was to be presented to him\r\nas a _souvenir_ of his visit to Holland. He worked at it every day till it\r\nwas finished, when he christened it the _Amsterdam_. His numerous\r\ninvestigations into science included surgery, and he carried his\r\ninstruments about with him, ever ready to pull a tooth, or bleed, or even\r\ntap a patient for the dropsy. In short, his desire for practical knowledge\r\nwas insatiable. Ten times a day, while accompanying his friend Calf and\r\nothers about the ships, and yards, and factories, and mills, he would ask,\r\n“Wat is dat?” and being told, would answer, “Dat wil ik zien,”—“I shall\r\nsee that.” His companions were not half so earnest as their master, and\r\nafter awhile they hired a large house, kept a professed cook, and enjoyed\r\nthemselves in idleness.\r\n\r\nWhile in Holland, the news arrived of a Russian victory over the Turks and\r\nTartars, and the imperial workman received the congratulations of the\r\nEmperor of Germany, the Kings of Sweden, Denmark, and other countries. He\r\ncelebrated the event by giving a grand entertainment to the principal\r\nofficials and merchants of Amsterdam, their wives and daughters. “The\r\nsumptuous dinner was accompanied and followed by a band of music, and in\r\nthe evening were plays, dancing, masquerades, illuminations, and\r\nfireworks. His respectable friend, Witsen, told him that he had\r\nentertained his countrymen like an emperor.” And now, after nine months’\r\nhard work at Zardam, he had an interview with King William at the Hague,\r\nwho arranged to transport him and his suite in one of the royal yachts,\r\naccompanied by two men-of-war.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: OLD DOCKYARD AT DEPTFORD.]\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: SAYE’S COURT, DEPTFORD.]\r\n\r\nNo secret was made of the Czar’s rank in London, although he tried to live\r\nas privately as possible. He was placed under the special charge of the\r\nMarquis of Carmarthen, and a great intimacy sprang up between them. A\r\nlarge house was hired for him and his suite at the bottom of York\r\nBuildings, where the marquis and he used to spend their evenings together\r\nfrequently in drinking “hot pepper and brandy.” But then a pint of brandy\r\nand a bottle of sherry was nothing uncommon as a morning draught for the\r\nCzar. After seeing all the sights of London, he paid visits to Chatham,\r\nPortsmouth, and elsewhere, but the larger part of his time was spent at\r\nDeptford, where he repaired to investigate and learn the higher branches\r\nof naval architecture and navigation. There is little or no evidence,\r\npopular tradition to the contrary notwithstanding, that he ever worked as\r\na shipwright there,(10) or engaged in more laborious employment than\r\nrowing, or in sailing yachts and boats about the Thames. The writer has\r\nbefore him now one of the conventional pictures of “Peter at Deptford.” It\r\nrepresents a smooth-faced youth of feminine appearance, and about sixteen\r\nyears old at most, vigorously engaged, apparently, in doing damage to a\r\nship’s bulwarks with a gigantic hammer and formidable spike. The fact is\r\nthat Peter was in his twenty-sixth year, had been the ruler of a great\r\nempire for several years, and was beyond his years in acquirements and\r\nearnestness; a man of strong passions, and sadly given to drink. Peter was\r\nglad to get out of town. Crowds gave him an amount of annoyance that was\r\ninexplicable to a Londoner; and he avoided, as much as he could, balls and\r\nassemblies and public gatherings for the same reason. Nor could he have\r\ndesired a more pleasant and suitable place than that which was provided\r\nfor him, the celebrated Saye’s Court, Evelyn’s charming house and\r\ngrounds(11) close to Deptford Dockyard, which had just become vacant by\r\nthe removal of Admiral Benbow, who had been its tenant. A special doorway\r\nwas broken through the boundary wall of the dockyard to facilitate\r\ncommunication for the Czar. Benbow had given poor Evelyn much\r\ndissatisfaction, but the new occupant was rather worse. His servant wrote\r\nto him, “There is a house full of people, right nasty. The Tzar lies next\r\nyour study, and dines in the parlour next your study. He dines at ten\r\no’clock, and six at night; is very seldom at home a whole night; very\r\noften in the king’s yard, or by water, dressed in several dresses. The\r\nking is expected there this day; the best parlour is pretty clean for him\r\nto be entertained in. The king pays for all he has.” But, alas for poor\r\nEvelyn’s hedges! The Czar, by way of exercise, and to prove his strength,\r\nused to trundle a wheel-barrow, full tilt, through a favourite\r\nholly-hedge, “which,” says Evelyn, “I can still show in my ruined gardens\r\nat Saye’s Court (thanks to the Tzar of Muscovy).” The Czar employed his\r\ndays in acquiring information on all branches of naval architecture, and\r\nin sailing about the river with Carmarthen and Sir Anthony Deane,\r\ncommissioner of the navy. “The Navy Board received directions from the\r\nAdmiralty to hire two vessels to be at the command of the Tzar whenever he\r\nshould think proper to sail on the Thames,” and the king made him a\r\npresent of a small vessel, the _Royal Transport_, giving orders to have\r\nsuch alterations and accommodations made in her as the Czar might desire.\r\n“But his great delight was to get into a small-decked boat, belonging to\r\nthe dockyard, and taking only Menzikoff, and three or four others of his\r\nsuite, to work the vessel with them, he being the helmsman; by this\r\npractice he said he should be able to teach them how to command ships when\r\nthey got home. Having finished their day’s work, they used to resort to a\r\npublic house in Great Tower Street, close to Tower Hill, to smoke their\r\npipes, and drink beer and brandy. The landlord had the Tzar of Muscovy’s\r\nhead painted and put up for his sign.” The original sign remained till\r\n1808.\r\n\r\nGreenwich Hospital surprised him, and King William, having one day asked\r\nhim how he liked his hospital for decayed seamen, Peter answered simply,\r\n“If I were the adviser of your Majesty, I should counsel you to remove\r\nyour court to Greenwich, and convert St. James’s into a hospital.” In the\r\nfirst week of March a sham naval fight was organised near Spithead, for\r\nhis amusement, eleven ships being engaged. The _Postman_, a journal of the\r\nperiod, says, “The representation of a sea engagement was excellently\r\nperformed before the Tzar of Muscovy, and continued a considerable time,\r\neach ship having twelve pounds of powder allowed; but all the bullets were\r\nlocked up in the hold, for fear the soldiers should mistake.” The\r\nenterprising journal did not, probably, send down a special\r\nrepresentative, as would any leading paper of to-day, and the small\r\nquantity of powder allowed must be a mistake. The Czar was greatly pleased\r\nwith the performance, and told Admiral Mitchell, who arranged the\r\nperformance, that “he considered the condition of an English admiral\r\nhappier than that of a Tzar of Russia.” On their way home from Portsmouth,\r\nthe Russian party, twenty-one in all, stopped a night at Godalming. The\r\nsea air had done so much good to their appetites that at dinner they\r\nmanaged to get through an entire sheep, three quarters of lamb, five ribs\r\nof beef, weighing three stone, a shoulder and loin of veal, eight fowls,\r\neight rabbits, two dozen and a half of sack, and one dozen of claret.\r\nTheir light breakfast consisted of half a sheep, a quarter of lamb, ten\r\npullets, twelve chickens, seven dozen eggs, salad “in proportion,” three\r\nquarts of brandy, and six quarts of mulled wine.\r\n\r\nWhen residing at Deptford, he made the acquaintance of the celebrated Dr.\r\nHalley, “to whom he communicated his plan of building a fleet, and in\r\ngeneral of introducing the arts and sciences into his country,” and asked\r\nhis opinions and advice on various subjects. The doctor spoke German\r\nfluently, and the Tzar was so much pleased with the philosopher’s\r\nconversation and remarks that he had him frequently to dine with him; and\r\nin his company he visited the Royal Observatory in Greenwich Park. An\r\nimportant concession was made by him to some leading merchants, through\r\nthe influence of the Marquis of Carmarthen. Tobacco had been so highly\r\ntaxed that none but the wealthy Russians could afford it. The Czar agreed\r\nthat on paying him down £12,000 (some accounts say £15,000) it should go\r\nin duty free. He stipulated that his friend Carmarthen should receive five\r\nshillings for every hogshead so admitted. Peter stuck to his friends, and\r\nhis kindheartedness in general does much to obliterate the memory of some\r\ntraits of character which are not to his credit. On leaving England, he\r\n“gave the king’s servants, at his departure, one hundred and twenty\r\nguineas, which was more than they deserved, they being very rude to him,”\r\nsays one plain-speaking historian. To the king he presented a rough ruby\r\nwhich the jewellers of Amsterdam had valued at £10,000 sterling. Peter\r\ncarried this gem to King William in his waistcoat pocket, wrapped up in a\r\npiece of brown paper. The king had treated him in a royal fashion, so far\r\nas Peter would allow him, and before he departed induced him to sit to Sir\r\nGodfrey Kneller for his portrait, which is now at Windsor. Four yachts and\r\ntwo ships of the Royal Navy were placed at his disposal when he departed\r\nonce more for Holland. Peter took with him to Russia three English\r\ncaptains who had served in the Royal Navy, twenty-five captains of the\r\nmerchant service, thirty pilots, thirty surgeons, two hundred gunners, and\r\na number of mechanics and smiths, making a total of little less than five\r\nhundred persons, all natives of Great Britain. A letter from one of them\r\nto a relative in England shows how much Peter did, almost immediately on\r\nhis return to Russia, in the interests of his navy. He had already\r\nthirty-six ships of war: twenty, ranging from thirty to sixty guns each,\r\nwere to be launched the following spring; eighteen galleys were being\r\nconstructed by Italian workmen, and one hundred smaller vessels were on\r\nthe stocks. The forests of masts he had seen at London and Amsterdam had\r\nfired his ambition, and we now find him not merely determined to have a\r\nnavy, but a port of the first class. Hence St. Petersburg.\r\n\r\nPassing over events in the history of Peter the Great not bearing on\r\nmaritime subjects, we learn that “Five months had scarcely elapsed from\r\nlaying the first stone of St. Petersburg, when a report was brought to the\r\nTzar that a large ship, under Dutch colours, was standing into the river.\r\nIt may be supposed this was a joyful piece of intelligence for the\r\nfounder. It was nothing short of realising the wish nearest his heart: to\r\nopen the Baltic for the nations of Europe to trade with his dominions, it\r\nconstituted them his neighbours; and he at once anticipated the day when\r\nhis ships would beat the Swedish navy, and drive them from a sea on which\r\nthey had long ridden triumphant with undivided sway. When Peter was\r\nemployed in building his fleet at Voronitz, Patrick Gordon one day asked\r\nhim, ‘Of what use do you expect all the vessels you are building to be,\r\nseeing you have no seaports?’ ‘My vessels shall make ports for\r\nthemselves,’ replied Peter, in a determined tone; a declaration which was\r\nnow on the eve of being accomplished.\r\n\r\n“No sooner was the communication made, than the Tzar, with his usual\r\nrapidity, set off to meet this welcome stranger. The skipper was invited\r\nto the house of Menzikoff: he sat down at table, and to his great\r\nastonishment, found that he was placed next the Tzar, and had actually\r\nbeen served by him. But not less astonished and delighted was Peter on\r\nlearning that the ship belonged to, and had been freighted by his old\r\nZaardam friend, with whom he had resided, Cornelius Calf. Permission was\r\nimmediately given to the skipper to land his cargo, consisting of salt,\r\nwine, and other articles of provisions, free of all duties. Nothing could\r\nbe more acceptable to the inhabitants of the new city than this cargo, the\r\nwhole of which was purchased by Peter, Menzikoff, and the several\r\nofficers, so that Auke Wybes, the skipper, made a most profitable\r\nadventure. On his departure he received a present of five hundred ducats,\r\nand each man of the crew, one hundred rix-dollars, as a premium for the\r\nfirst ship that had entered the port of St. Petersburg.”(12) The second\r\nship to arrive was also Dutch; the third was an English vessel; both\r\nreceived the same premium. The rapidity with which the swampy banks of the\r\nNeva were covered with wharfs and buildings has been almost unexampled in\r\nhistory. Peter had Amsterdam in his eye when he laid out St. Petersburg,\r\nand he had secured the services of a number of Dutch ship-builders and\r\nmasons, architects, and surveyors well versed in making solid foundations\r\non swampy land.\r\n\r\nAnd now, while England was distracted by the civil war of the first\r\nPretender, and by the rupture with Charles XII. of Sweden, she had much\r\ntrouble with the Barbary pirates, who, in the West Indies in particular,\r\nconstantly harassed her shipping interests. So great a nuisance had these\r\n“water-rats” become that £100 head-money was offered for every captain,\r\n£40 for any rank from a lieutenant to a gunner, and £20 for every pirate\r\nseaman. Any private who delivered up his commander was entitled to £200 on\r\nthe conviction of the latter. But there were also at that period\r\n“land-rats” at home, as bad as any pirate, preying on the public purse.\r\nThis was the epoch when Hamlet’s words “they’re all mad there,” might\r\nalmost have been said of England, and with even greater truth of our\r\nneighbours across the Channel. Two extraordinary schemes, one of which was\r\nto make France the richest of commercial nations, and the second of which\r\nwas to pay the national debt of England, were propounded, great companies\r\nraised, and supported by half the people, from princes to petty tradesmen.\r\nAs projects depending upon commerce with foreign countries, they, of\r\ncourse, are intimately connected with our subject. Need it be said that\r\nthe writer refers to the two extraordinary delusions known as the\r\nMississippi Scheme and the South Sea Bubble?\r\n\r\nThe first of these projects was designed to develop the resources of the\r\ngreat country lying round the Mississippi, especially Louisiana; to open\r\nup mineral deposits supposed to be wonderfully rich; and to carry on a\r\ngeneral trade with that part of America. The second, which more intimately\r\nconcerns us, included a monopoly of trade with the South Sea, a somewhat\r\nelastic title, but which meant at the time commerce with the countries of\r\nSpanish America. The South Sea Company was originated by Harley, Earl of\r\nOxford, in 1711, with the distinct view of “providing for the discharge of\r\nthe army and navy debentures, and other parts of the floating debt,\r\namounting to nearly ten million sterling.” A company of merchants took\r\nthis debt upon themselves, the Government agreeing to secure them, for a\r\ncertain period, six per cent. interest, and grant them the monopoly of the\r\ntrade to the South Seas. The most exaggerated ideas relating to the\r\nmineral wealth of South America were prevalent at the time, and when a\r\nreport, most industriously spread, was circulated that Philip V. of Spain\r\nwas ready to concede four ports of Chili and Peru for purposes of trade,\r\nSouth Sea stock rose in value with extraordinary rapidity. That monarch,\r\nhowever, never meant to grant anything like a free trade to the English.\r\nAfter sundry negotiations had been opened the royal assent was given to a\r\ncontract, conceding the privilege of supplying the colonies with negroes\r\nfor thirty years, and of sending _once a year one vessel_ “limited both as\r\nto tonnage and value of cargo” to trade with Mexico, Peru, and Chili, the\r\nking to enjoy one-fourth of the profits. On these hard conditions and\r\nslender privileges was the great Bubble blown into popular esteem. Rumours\r\nof commercial treaties between England and Spain were circulated, whereby\r\nthe latter was to grant free trade to all her colonies; the rich produce\r\nof the Potosi mines “was to be brought to England until silver should\r\nbecome almost as plentiful as iron. For cotton and woollen goods, with\r\nwhich we could supply them in abundance, the dwellers in Mexico were to\r\nempty their golden mines. The company of merchants trading to the South\r\nSeas would be the richest the world ever saw, and every hundred pounds\r\ninvested would produce hundreds per annum to the stockholder.”(13) These\r\nand still more lying statements were spread in every direction. The stock\r\nrose like a rocket. And, so far as the present writer can discover, the\r\nfirst voyage of the one annual ship, not made till 1717, six years after\r\nthe first establishment of the company, was also its last! The following\r\nyear the trade was suppressed by the rupture with Spain.\r\n\r\n“It seemed at that time as if the whole nation had turned stock-jobbers.\r\nExchange Alley was every day blocked up by crowds, and Cornhill was\r\nimpassable for the number of carriages. Everybody came to purchase stock.\r\n‘Every fool aspired to be a knave.’ In the words of a ballad published at\r\nthe time, and sung about the streets—\r\n\r\n  “‘Then stars and garters did appear\r\n      Among the meaner rabble;\r\n  To buy and sell, to see and hear\r\n      The Jews and Gentiles squabble.\r\n\r\n  ‘The greatest ladies thither came,\r\n      And plied in chariots daily;\r\n  Or pawned their jewels for a sum\r\n      To venture in the Alley.’”\r\n\r\nNot merely South Sea stock, but schemes of even a wilder nature now\r\ndeluged the market. It would seem incredible, but it is vouched for on\r\ngood authority, that one adventurer started “_A company for carrying on an\r\nundertaking of great advantage, but nobody to know what it is_,” and in\r\none day sold a thousand shares, the deposit on which was £2 per share. He\r\nthought it prudent to decamp with the £2,000, and was no more heard of.\r\nMackay publishes a list of eighty-six bubble companies, which were\r\neventually declared illegal and abolished. But the South Sea Bubble was a\r\nTriton among these minnows, and the directors, having once tasted the\r\nprofits of their scheme by the rapid rise of its shares, kept their\r\nemissaries at work. Nor indeed were they much needed, for every person\r\ninterested in the stock endeavoured to draw a knot of listeners round him\r\nin ’Change Alley, or its purlieus, to whom he expatiated on the treasures\r\nof the South American Seas. Then came the rumour that Gibraltar was to be\r\nexchanged for certain places on the coast of Peru. Instead of paying a\r\ntribute to the King of Spain, the company would be able to trade freely,\r\nand send as many ships as they liked.\r\n\r\n  “Visions of ingots danced before their eyes,”\r\n\r\nand the directors opened their books for a subscription of a million, and\r\nthen for a second million, and the frantic speculators took it all. Swift\r\ndescribed ’Change Alley as a gulf in the South Seas:—\r\n\r\n  “Subscribers here by thousands float,\r\n    And jostle one another down,\r\n  Each paddling in his leaky boat,\r\n    And here they fish for gold and drown.\r\n\r\n  “Now buried in the depths below,\r\n    Now mounted up to heaven again,\r\n  They reel and stagger to and fro,\r\n    At their wits’ end, like drunken men.\r\n\r\n  “Meantime, secure on Garraway cliffs,\r\n    A savage race, by shipwrecks fed,\r\n  Lie waiting for the foundering skiffs,\r\n    And strip the bodies of the dead.”\r\n\r\nThe directors used every art to keep up the price of the stock. It rose\r\nfinally to £1,000 per share. A few weeks afterwards it was down to £175,\r\nthen to £135, and the Bubble had burst.\r\n\r\nTo detail the various plans tried or suggested to bolster up the company,\r\nthe Parliamentary inquiries, or the stringent measures adopted to punish\r\nthe directors, would be out of place here. Suffice it to say that a bill\r\nwas brought in for restraining the South Sea directors and officers from\r\nleaving the kingdom for a twelvemonth. They were forbidden to realise on\r\ntheir estates and effects, neither must they will or remove them.\r\nEventually they were obliged to disgorge their gains. “A sum amounting to\r\ntwo million and fourteen thousand pounds was confiscated from their\r\nestates towards repairing the mischief they had done, each man being\r\nallowed a certain residue in proportion to his conduct and circumstances,\r\nwith which he might begin the world anew. Sir John Blunt was only allowed\r\n£5,000 out of his fortune of upwards of £183,000; Sir John Fellows was\r\nallowed £10,000 out of £243,000; Sir Theodore Janssen £50,000 out of\r\n£243,000; Mr. Edward Gibbon £10,000 out of £106,000; Sir John Lambert\r\n£5,000 out of £72,000.” After every effort on the part of the Committee of\r\nInvestigation, a dividend of about 33 per cent. was divided among the\r\nunfortunate proprietors and stock-holders. It took long before public\r\ncredit was restored.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: COMMODORE ANSON.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE HISTORY OF SHIPS AND SHIPPING INTERESTS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n    A Grand Epoch of Discovery—Anson’s Voyage—Difficulties of manning\r\n     the Fleet—Five Hundred Invalided Pensioners drafted—The Spanish\r\n       Squadron under Pizarro—Its Disastrous Voyage—One Vessel run\r\n       ashore—Rats at Four Dollars each—A Man-of-war held by eleven\r\n      Indians—Anson at the Horn—Fearful Outbreak of Scurvy—Ashore at\r\n     Robinson Crusoe’s Island—Death of two-thirds of the Crews—Beauty\r\n     of Juan Fernandez—Loss of the _Wager_—Drunken and Insubordinate\r\n    Crew—Attempt to blow up the Captain—A Midshipman shot—Desertion of\r\n         the Ship’s Company—Prizes taken by Anson—His Humanity to\r\n      Prisoners—The _Gloucester_ abandoned at Sea—Delightful Stay at\r\n       Tinian—The _Centurion_ blown out to Sea—Despair of those on\r\n        Shore—Its Safe Return—Capture of the Manilla Galleon—A Hot\r\n    Fight—Prize worth a Million and a half Dollars—Return to England.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second of the greatest epochs of discovery—one, indeed, hardly\r\ninferior to that of Columbus and Da Gama, when Dampier, Byron, Wallis, and\r\nCarteret, Cook, and Clerke may be said to have substantially completed the\r\nmap of the world in its most essential and leading features—would follow\r\nin proper sequence here, but for a pre-arranged plan, which will place\r\n“The Decisive Voyages of the World” by themselves. One voyage of this\r\nperiod, that of Commodore Anson, deserves mention, inasmuch as it was\r\ninstigated for the purpose of making reprisals on the Spaniards for their\r\nbehaviour in searching English ships found near any of their settlements\r\nin the West Indies or Spanish Main, and not for attempts at discovery. It\r\nalso gives some little insight into the condition of the navy at the\r\nperiod. It was most wretchedly equipped and manned, and although the ships\r\nwere placed under Anson’s command in November, 1739, they were not ready\r\nto sail till ten months later, so great was the difficulty in obtaining\r\nmen. They had to be taken from all and any sources. Five hundred\r\nout-pensioners from Chelsea Hospital were sent on board, many of whom were\r\nsixty years of age, and some threescore and ten. Before the ships sailed,\r\n240 of them, fortunately for themselves, deserted, their place being\r\nfilled by a nearly equal number of raw marines, recruits who were so\r\nuntrained that Anson would not permit them to fire off their muskets, for\r\nfear of accidents! Of the poor pensioners who sailed, not one returned to\r\ntell the story of their disasters, while of the whole squadron, consisting\r\nof six ships of war, mounting 226 guns, one alone, the _Centurion_,\r\ncommanded by Anson himself, reached home, after a cruise of three years\r\nand nine months. The history of this voyage, as told by the chaplain of\r\nthe vessel,(14) is one round of miseries and disasters.\r\n\r\n“Mr. Anson,” says the narrator of this eventful voyage, “was greatly\r\nchagrined at having such a decrepit attachment allotted to him; for he was\r\nfully persuaded that the greatest part of them would perish long before\r\nthey arrived at the scene of action, since the delays he had already\r\nencountered necessarily confined his passage round Cape Horn to the most\r\nrigorous season of the year. Sir Charles Wager (one of the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty) too, joined in opinion with the Commodore, that the invalids\r\nwere no way proper for this service, and solicited strenuously to have\r\nthem exchanged; but he was told that persons who were supposed to be\r\nbetter judges than he or Mr. Anson, thought them the properest men that\r\ncould be employed on this occasion.” All of the poor pensioners “who had\r\nlimbs and strength to walk out of Portsmouth deserted, leaving behind them\r\nonly such as were literally invalids.... Indeed, it is difficult to\r\nconceive a more moving scene than the embarkation of these unhappy\r\nveterans. They were themselves extremely averse to the service they were\r\nengaged on, and fully apprised of all the disasters they were afterwards\r\nexposed to, the apprehensions of which were strongly marked by the concern\r\nthat appeared in their countenances, which were mixed with no small degree\r\nof indignation.” Nor can one read these facts without sharing the same\r\nfeeling. Brave men who had spent the best of their youth and prime in the\r\nservice of their country, were ruthlessly sent to certain death.\r\n\r\nOn the 18th of September, 1740, the squadron, consisting of five\r\nmen-of-war, a sloop-of-war, and two tenders, or victualling ships, made\r\nsail. The vessels comprised the _Centurion_, of sixty guns and 400 men,\r\ncommanded by George Anson; the _Gloucester_ and _Severn_, each fifty guns\r\nand 300 men; the _Pearl_, of forty guns and 250 men; the _Wager_, of\r\ntwenty-eight guns and 160 men; and the _Tryal_ sloop, eight guns and 100\r\nmen. On their way down the Channel they were joined by other men-of-war\r\nconvoying the Turkey, Straits, and American merchant fleets, so that for\r\nsome distance out to sea the combined fleet amounted to no less than\r\neleven vessels of the Royal Navy, and 150 sail of merchantmen. Anson\r\ncalled at Madeira, and refreshed his crews, from thence appointing the\r\nIsland of St. Catherine’s, on the coast of Brazil, as the rendezvous for\r\nhis fleet. Arrived there it was found that a large number of the men were\r\nsickly, as many as eighty being so reported on the _Centurion_ alone, and\r\nthe other ships in proportion. Tents were erected ashore for the invalids,\r\nand the vessels were thoroughly cleaned, smoked between decks, and finally\r\nwashed well with vinegar. The vessels themselves required many repairs to\r\nfit them for the intended voyage round the Horn. The then governor of this\r\nPortuguese island, one Don Jose Sylva De Paz, behaved very badly, doing\r\nall in his power to prevent Anson from obtaining fresh provisions, and\r\nsecretly dispatched an express to Buenos Ayres, where a Spanish squadron\r\nunder Don Josef Pizarro then lay, with an account of the number and\r\nstrength of the English ships. The history and disasters of this squadron\r\nwould fill a long chapter.\r\n\r\nPizarro had with him six ships of war, and a very large force of men, two\r\nof the vessels having seven hundred each on board. But in spite of his\r\nsuperior strength, he avoided any engagement at this time, and seems to\r\nhave been extremely desirous of rounding Cape Horn before Anson, for he\r\nleft before his provision ships arrived. Notwithstanding this haste the\r\ntwo squadrons were once or twice very close together on the passage to\r\nCape Horn, and the _Pearl_, being separated from the fleet, and mistaking\r\nthe Spanish squadron for it, narrowly escaped falling into their hands. In\r\na terrible gale off the Horn the Spanish vessels became separated, and\r\nPizarro turned his own ship’s head, the _Asia_, for the Plata once more.\r\nOne of his squadron, the _Hermiona_, of fifty-four guns and 500 men, is\r\nbelieved to have foundered at sea, for she was never heard of more.\r\nAnother, the _Guipuscoa_, a still larger ship, with 700 souls on board,\r\nwas run ashore and sunk on the coast of Brazil. Famine and mutiny were\r\nadded to the horrors of these voyages. On the latter-named ship 250 died\r\nfrom hunger and fatigue, for those who were still strong enough to work at\r\nthe pumps received only an ounce and a half of biscuit _per diem_, while\r\nthe incapable were allowed an ounce of wheat! Men fell down dead at the\r\npumps, and out of an original crew of 700, not more than eighty or a\r\nhundred were capable of duty. The captain had conceived some hopes of\r\nsaving his ship by taking her into St. Catherine’s. When the crew learned\r\nhis intention, they left off pumping, and “being enraged at the hardships\r\nthey had suffered, and the numbers they had lost (there being at that time\r\nno less than thirty dead bodies lying on the deck) they all, with one\r\nvoice, cried out, ‘On shore! on shore!’ and obliged the captain to run the\r\nship in directly for the land, where the fifth day after she sunk with her\r\nstores and all her furniture on board her.” Four hundred of the crew got,\r\nhowever, safely to shore. On another of the Spanish ships they became so\r\nreduced “that rats, when they could be caught, were sold for four dollars\r\napiece; and a sailor who died on board had his death concealed for some\r\ndays by his brother, who during that time lay in the same hammock with the\r\ncorpse, only to receive the dead man’s allowance of provisions.” The\r\n_Asia_ arrived at Monte Video with only half her crew; the _Esperanza_, a\r\nfifty-gun ship, had only fifty-eight remaining out of 450 men, and the\r\n_St. Estevan_ had lost about half her hands. The latter vessel was\r\ncondemned, and broken up in the Plata.\r\n\r\nWhen Pizarro determined, in 1745, to return to Spain, they managed to\r\npatch up the _Asia_, at Monte Video, but had only 100 of the original\r\nhands left. They pressed a number of Portuguese, and put on board a number\r\nof English prisoners (not, however, of Anson’s squadron) and some Indians\r\nof the country. Among the latter was a chief named Orellana, and ten of\r\nhis tribe, whom the Spaniards treated with great inhumanity. The Indians\r\ndetermined to have their revenge. They managed to acquire a number of long\r\nknives, and employed their leisure in cutting thongs of raw hide, and in\r\nfixing to each end of the thongs the double-headed shot of the\r\nquarter-deck guns, which when swung round their heads, became powerful\r\nweapons. In two or three days all was ready for their scheme of vengeance.\r\n\r\nIt was about nine in the evening, when the decks were comparatively clear,\r\nthat Orellana and his companions, having divested themselves of most of\r\ntheir clothes, came together to the quarter-deck, approaching the door of\r\nthe great cabin. The boatswain ordered them away. Orellana, however, paid\r\nno attention to him, placed two of his men at either gangway, and raising\r\na hideous war-cry, they commenced the massacre, slashing in all directions\r\nwith the knives, and brandishing the double-headed shot. The six who\r\nremained with the chief on the quarter-deck laid nearly forty Spaniards\r\nlow in a few minutes, of whom twenty were killed on the spot. Many of the\r\nofficers fled into the great cabin, and hastily barricaded the door. A\r\nperfect panic ensued on board. Many attempting to escape to the forecastle\r\nwere stabbed as they passed by the four Indian sentries, and others jumped\r\ninto the waist, where they thought themselves fortunate to lie concealed\r\namong the cattle on board; a number fled up the main shrouds and kept on\r\nthe tops or rigging. The fact is that those on board did not know whether\r\nit was not a general mutiny among the pressed hands and prisoners, and the\r\nyells of the Indians and groans of the dying, and the confused clamour of\r\nthe crew, were all heightened in effect by the obscurity of the night. And\r\nnow Orellana secured the arm-chest, which had been placed on the\r\nquarter-deck for security a few days before. It was of no use to him, as\r\nhe only found a quantity of fire-arms, which he did not understand, or for\r\nwhich he had no ammunition; the cutlasses, for which he was in search,\r\nwere fortunately hidden underneath. By this time Pizarro had established\r\nsome communication with the gun-rooms and between decks, and discovered\r\nthat the English prisoners had not intermeddled in the mutiny, which was\r\nconfined to the Indians. They had only pistols in the cabin, and no\r\nammunition for them; at last, however, they managed to obtain some by\r\nlowering a bucket out of the cabin window, into which the gunner, out of\r\none of the gun-room ports, put a quantity of cartridges. After loading,\r\nthey cautiously and partially opened the cabin door, firing several shots,\r\nat first without effect. At last, Mindinuetta, one of the captains of the\r\noriginal squadron, had the fortune to shoot Orellana dead on the spot, on\r\nwhich his faithful companions one and all leaped into the sea and\r\nperished. For full two hours these eleven Indians had held a ship of\r\nsixty-six guns, and manned by nearly 500 hands!\r\n\r\nPizarro, having escaped this peril, reached Spain in safety, “after having\r\nbeen absent between four and five years, and having,” says the narrator,\r\n“by his attendance on our expedition, diminished the naval power of Spain\r\nby above three thousand hands (the flower of their sailors), and by four\r\nconsiderable ships of war and a patache.” He had not encountered Anson,\r\nnor done any of his ships damage. To the disasters and adventures\r\nencountered by that commander we must now return.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: THE “CENTURION” OFF CAPE HORN]\r\n\r\nOff Cape Horn the weather was so terrible that it obliged the oldest\r\nmariners on board “to confess that what they had hitherto called storms\r\nwere inconsiderable gales.” Short, mountainous waves pitched and tossed\r\nthe vessels so violently that the men were in perpetual danger of being\r\ndashed to pieces. One of the best seamen on the _Centurion_ was canted\r\noverboard and drowned; his manly form was long seen struggling in the\r\nwater, he being a good swimmer, while those on board were powerless to\r\nassist him. Another man was thrown violently into the hold and broke his\r\nthigh; a second dislocated his neck, and one of the boatswain’s mates\r\nbroke his collar-bone twice. The squalls were so sudden that they were\r\nobliged to lie-to for days together, almost under bare poles, and when in\r\na lull they ventured to set a little canvas, the blasts would return and\r\ncarry away their sails. Squalls of rain and snow constantly occurred. The\r\n_Centurion_, labouring in the heavy seas, “was now grown so loose in her\r\nupper works that she let in the water at every seam, so that every part\r\nwithin board was constantly exposed to the sea-water, and scarcely any of\r\nthe officers ever lay in dry beds. Indeed, it was very rare that two\r\nnights ever passed without many of them being driven from their beds by\r\nthe deluge of water that came in upon them.” Shrouds snapped, and yards\r\nand masts were lost on several of the squadron. Two of the vessels, the\r\n_Severn_ and the _Pearl_, became separated from the fleet, and were no\r\nmore seen by them on the voyage.\r\n\r\nBut their worst trouble was a terrible outbreak of that insidious disease,\r\nthe scurvy. In April, May, and part of June, the loss on the _Centurion_\r\nalone was two hundred men, and at length they could not muster more than\r\nsix fore-mast hands in a watch capable of duty. The symptoms of this\r\nhorrible complaint are various; but apart from the universal scorbutic\r\nmanifestations on the body, diseased bones, swelled legs, and putrid gums,\r\nthere is an extraordinary lassitude and weakness, which degenerate into a\r\nproneness to swoon, and even die, on the least exertion of strength, and a\r\ndejection of spirits which leads the invalid to take alarm at the most\r\ntrifling accident. Let the reader imagine what all this meant on\r\nclosely-packed ships, tempest-tossed off the dreaded Horn. When at length\r\nthe _Centurion_ reached the famed Crusoe Island, Juan Fernandez, the\r\nlieutenant “could muster no more than two quartermasters, and six\r\nfore-mast hands capable of working.” Without the assistance of the\r\nofficers, servants, and boys, they might never have been able to reach the\r\nisland after sighting it, and with such aid they were _two hours_ in\r\ntrimming the sails. When their sloop, the _Tryal_, followed them to this\r\nhaven of refuge, only the captain, lieutenant, and three men were able to\r\nstand by the sails. When, ten days later on, the _Gloucester_ was seen in\r\nthe offing, and Anson had sent off a boat laden with fresh water, fish,\r\nand vegetables for the crew, it was found that they had already thrown\r\noverboard two-thirds of their complement. It took them, with some\r\nassistance sent by Anson, a month before they could fetch the bay,\r\ncontrary winds and currents, but more their utterly exhausted condition,\r\nbeing the causes. They were now reduced to eighty out of an original crew\r\nof three hundred men. Severe as have been the sufferings from scurvy\r\nendured on many of the Arctic expeditions, there is no case on record as\r\npainful as this. The three ships which reached Juan Fernandez had on board\r\nwhen they left England 961 men; before the ravages of the disease were\r\nstopped the number was reduced to 335, scarcely sufficient to man the\r\n_Centurion_ alone. And it must be remembered that all this time they were\r\nuncertain of the movements of Pizarro and his fleet, which might appear\r\namong them at any moment. The refreshment obtained at the island, fresh\r\nwater, vegetables, fruit, fish in abundance, a little goat’s flesh, and\r\nseal-meat, proved of great value to those of the crew whose constitutions\r\nwere not thoroughly undermined by the fell disease; but it was as much as\r\nthey could do to effect the many repairs required on the vessels, to the\r\nextent even of removing and replacing masts.\r\n\r\nOf the beauty of many parts of Juan Fernandez the chaplain speaks in\r\nenthusiastic terms. “Some particular spots occurred in these valleys,\r\nwhere the shade and fragrance of the contiguous woods, the loftiness of\r\nthe overhanging rocks, and the transparency and frequent falls of the\r\nneighbouring streams, presented scenes of such elegance and dignity, as\r\nwould with difficulty be rivalled in any other part of the globe.... I\r\nshall finish this article with a short account of the spot where the\r\ncommodore pitched his tent, and which he made choice of for his own\r\nresidence, though I despair of conveying an adequate idea of its beauty.\r\nThe piece of ground which he chose was a small lawn, that lay on a little\r\nascent, at the distance of about half a mile from the sea. In the front of\r\nhis tent there was a large avenue cut through the woods to the seaside,\r\nwhich, sloping to the water with a gentle descent, opened a prospect of\r\nthe bay and the ships at anchor. This lawn was screened behind by a tall\r\nwood of myrtle sweeping round it, in the form of a theatre; the slope on\r\nwhich the wood stood rising with a much sharper ascent than the lawn\r\nitself, though not so much but that the hills and precipices within-land\r\ntowered up considerably above the tops of the trees, and added to the\r\ngrandeur of the view. There were besides two streams of crystal water,\r\nwhich ran on the right and left of the tent within a hundred yards’\r\ndistance, and were shaded by the trees which skirted the lawn on either\r\nside, and completed the symmetry of the whole.”\r\n\r\nMeantime, the other vessels of the squadron did not put in an appearance.\r\nThat two of them, the _Pearl_ and _Severn_, were not to be expected, we\r\nhave already learned; but what had become of the _Wager_? It was learned\r\nafterwards that while making the passage to the island of Socoro, one of\r\nthe rendezvous of the squadron, she had become entangled among the rocks\r\nand grounded, soon becoming an utter wreck. The Honourable John Byron,\r\nafterwards a commodore in his Majesty’s service, but then a youngster on\r\nboard, has left an account of the disaster in his well-known work.(15) “In\r\nthe morning, about four o’clock,” says he, “the ship struck. The shock we\r\nreceived upon this occasion, though very great, being not unlike a blow of\r\na heavy sea, such as in the series of preceding storms we had often\r\nexperienced, was taken for the same; but we were soon undeceived by her\r\nstriking again more violently than before, which laid her upon her\r\nbeam-ends, the sea making a fair breach over her. Every person that now\r\ncould stir was presently upon the quarter-deck; and many of those were\r\nalert upon this occasion that had not showed their faces upon deck for\r\nabove two months before; several poor wretches, who were in the last stage\r\nof the scurvy, and who could not get out of their hammocks, were\r\nimmediately drowned.” Some seemed bereaved of their senses; one man was\r\nseen stalking about the deck flourishing a cutlass over his head, calling\r\nhimself king of the country, and striking everybody he came near, till he\r\nwas knocked down by some of those he had assaulted. “Some, reduced before\r\nby long sickness and the scurvy, became on this occasion as it were\r\npetrified and bereaved of all sense, like inanimate logs, and were bandied\r\nto and fro by the jerks and rolls of the ship, without exerting any\r\nefforts to help themselves.... The man at the helm, though both rudder and\r\ntiller were gone, kept his station; and being asked by one of the officers\r\nif the ship would steer or not, first took his time to make trial by the\r\nwheel, and then answered with as much respect and coolness as if the ship\r\nhad been in the greatest safety; and immediately after applied himself\r\nwith his usual serenity to his duty, persuaded it did not become him to\r\ndesert it as long as the ship kept together.” The captain, who had\r\ndislocated his shoulder by a fall the day before, was coolness itself, and\r\none of the mates did all in his power to inspire them with the belief that\r\nthey would not be lost so near land. This wrought a change in many who but\r\na few minutes before had been in despair, praying on their knees for\r\nmercy. It was another illustration of—\r\n\r\n  “When the devil was sick,”\r\n\r\nfor they commenced breaking in the casks of brandy or wine as they came up\r\nthe hatchway, and several got so intoxicated that they were drowned on\r\nboard, and lay floating about the decks for several days. The boatswain\r\nand some of the men would not leave the ship so long as there was any\r\nliquor to be found on her; and Captain Cheap, having got off as many of\r\nthe crew as would come, about a hundred and forty in number, suffered\r\nhimself to be helped out of his bed, put into the boat, and carried\r\nashore.\r\n\r\nAfter passing a miserable night, almost without shelter, the calls of\r\nhunger—most of them having fasted forty-eight hours—obliged them to seek\r\nfor sustenance. Two or three pounds of biscuit dust, one sea-gull, and\r\nsome wild celery, were boiled up into a kind of soup, which made all very\r\nill who partook of it. It was at first supposed that the wild herb was the\r\ncause, but it was soon discovered that the biscuit dust, the sweepings of\r\nthe bread-room, had been gathered in a tobacco bag, and that the tobacco\r\ndust mingled with it had acted as an emetic.\r\n\r\nStill a number of the wretched crew remained on board, pilfering all they\r\ncould find, often whether it could be of use to them or not, and showing a\r\nparticular desire to provide themselves with arms and ammunition. They\r\naverred that the authority of the officers must cease with the loss of the\r\nship; but as they came ashore, the arms were taken from them. When the\r\nboatswain came ashore in laced clothes, Captain Cheap knocked him down.\r\n“It was scarce possible to refrain from laughter at the whimsical\r\nappearance these fellows made, who, having rifled the chests of the\r\nofficers’ best suits, had put them on over their greasy trousers and dirty\r\nchecked shirts. They were soon stripped of their finery, as they had\r\nbefore been obliged to resign their arms.” The cutter, turned keel\r\nupwards, was now placed on props and covered, so that it made a reasonably\r\ncomfortable habitation. Shell-fish were found in tolerable abundance, “but\r\nthis rummaging of the shore,” says Byron, “was now become extremely\r\nirksome to those who had any feeling, by the bodies of our drowned people\r\nthrown among the rocks, some of which were hideous spectacles, from the\r\nmangled condition they were in by the violent surf that drove in upon the\r\ncoast. These horrors were overcome by the distresses of our people, who\r\nwere even glad of the occasion of killing the gallinazo (the carrion crow\r\nof that country) while preying on these carcases, in order to make a meal\r\nof them.”\r\n\r\nSuch stores as could be landed were placed in a guarded tent, and doled\r\nout carefully. A few Indians arrived, and, after some parley, proved\r\nfriendly, and were presented with sundry trifles. The looking-glasses\r\nastonished them; “the beholder could not conceive it to be his own face\r\nthat was represented, but that of some other behind it, which he therefore\r\nwent round to the back of the glass to find out.” They left, and in two\r\ndays returned with three sheep, which astonished the officers, inasmuch as\r\nthey were far from any of the Spanish settlements.\r\n\r\nAnd now mutiny and desertion ensued. One section of the men, “a most\r\ndesperate and abandoned crew,” attempted, by placing a barrel of gunpowder\r\nclose to the captain’s hut, with a train to be lighted at a distance, to\r\ndestroy their commander and his authority by one fell blow, but were\r\ndissuaded by one of their number, who had some conscience left. They\r\neventually built a punt, and converted the hull of one of the ship’s masts\r\ninto a canoe, escaping therewith to the mainland. They were never heard of\r\nmore. These men were a good riddance, but a more unfortunate event was to\r\nfollow. Mr. Cozens, a midshipman, had been placed under confinement for\r\nbeing drunk, and using abusive language to the captain, but was soon after\r\nreleased. Subsequently he had a dispute with the surgeon, and later with\r\nthe purser. The latter told him that he had “come to mutiny,” and fired\r\nhis pistol at him, narrowly missing him. The captain, hearing all this,\r\nrushed out, and, without asking any questions, shot Cozens through the\r\nhead, and then declined to allow him to be removed to shelter. The\r\nwretched young man (whom Byron believes to have been purposely “kept warm\r\nwith liquor, and set on by some ill-designing persons,” as he had always\r\nbeen a good-natured, inoffensive man when sober) was allowed by the\r\ncaptain to die like a dog, “with no other covering than a bit of canvas\r\nthrown over some bushes,” fourteen days afterwards. This gave the men a\r\ngood excuse for that which they were about to execute.\r\n\r\nIt had been arranged that the long-boat, rescued from the wreck, should be\r\nlengthened. The captain proposed that they should proceed northwards in\r\nthe Pacific, hoping that they might encounter and master one of the\r\nenemy’s ships, and rejoin Commodore Anson; the men, very generally, were\r\nbent on making their voyage home through the Straits of Magellan. While\r\nthe alterations were in progress, the matter rested temporarily, as they\r\nwere occupied in saving portions of, or stores from, the wreck, or in\r\nobtaining shell-fish and sea-fowl, which seem not to have been too\r\nabundant. Byron had cherished in his little hut a poor Indian dog, which\r\nhad become much attached to him. One day a hungry party of the men came to\r\nhim, and, after a little ineffectual remonstrance, took the dog away and\r\nkilled it; “upon which,” says Byron, “thinking that I had at least as good\r\na right to a share as the rest, I sat down with them, and partook of their\r\nrepast. Three weeks after that I was glad to make a meal of his paws and\r\nskin, which, upon recollecting the spot where they had killed him, I found\r\nthrown aside and rotten.” One of the men constructed a novel craft from a\r\nlarge cask, to which he lashed two logs, one on either side. In this he\r\nventured out to sea, and often managed to get wild fowl. One day he was\r\nupset by a heavy sea, but managed to scramble to a solitary rock, where he\r\nremained two days, till accidentally rescued by a boat party.\r\n\r\nWhile the coast was being reconnoitred, the “old cabal” had been revived,\r\nthe debates of which generally ended in riot and drunkenness. The meeting\r\nof the leading mutineers was held in a large tent, which had been made\r\nsnug, by lining it with bales of broadcloth driven from the wreck.\r\nEighteen of the ship’s company had possession of this tent, from whence\r\ncommittees were dispatched with their resolutions, and quite as often with\r\ndemands for liquor. The captain seemingly acquiesced, so far as their\r\nprojected voyage was concerned; but when they began to stipulate that his\r\npowers as commander must be restricted, he naturally insisted upon the\r\nfull exercise of his rights. “This broke all measures between them, and\r\nthey were from this time determined he should go with them, whether he\r\nwould or no.” The unfortunate affair concerning Cozens was raked up, and\r\nthey threatened to put him under confinement, and bring him to trial in\r\nEngland. When, however, they found that the long boat, cutter, and barge\r\nwere barely large enough to carry all, they agreed to leave him behind,\r\nwith the surgeon, and one of the officers of marines. Byron was taken on\r\nboard, but, as he says, “was determined, upon the first opportunity, to\r\nleave them.” They were in all eighty-one when they left the island. Their\r\nintention was to put into some harbour, if possible, every evening, as\r\nthey were in no condition for long sea-trips, neither would their scanty\r\nprovisions have lasted many days. Their water was contained in a few small\r\npowder barrels; their flour was to be lengthened out by a mixture of\r\nsea-weed; and their other supplies must depend upon their success in\r\nhunting or fishing. Next day they considered it necessary to send back the\r\nbarge for some spare canvas, and Byron took the opportunity of leaving\r\nthem. When they were clear of the long-boat, he found that the men on\r\nboard contemplated deserting the deserters also. They “were extremely\r\nwelcome to Captain Cheap.” Some attempts were made to get a share of the\r\nprovisions from the mutineers, but they absolutely refused. When they had\r\nleft the captain and the two other officers, they had given them six\r\npieces of beef, the same of pork, and ninety pounds of flour. For a day or\r\ntwo after Byron’s return with a few of the men, a small allowance was\r\ndoled out to them; “yet it was upon the foot of favour,” and soon ceased,\r\nafter which they had to subsist on “a weed called laugh,” fried in the\r\ntallow of some candles they had saved, and wild celery. The account of\r\ntheir sufferings, and eventual escape to Chili, forms the bulk of the\r\nvolume from which this narrative is taken. What became of the long-boat\r\nand its crew of mutineers? More than three months after they deserted the\r\ncaptain, thirty of them arrived at Rio Grande, on the coast of Brazil;\r\ntwenty had been left at various points, and a larger number had died from\r\nstarvation.\r\n\r\nBut to return once more to Anson. Just at the time they were straining all\r\npoints to make ready for leaving Juan Fernandez, a sail was espied far in\r\nthe offing. Whilst the vessel advanced, they fancied that she might be one\r\nof their own ships; but when she hauled off, it was determined to pursue\r\nher. The _Centurion_ being in the most forward state, immediately got\r\nunder sail; but the wind being light, they soon lost sight of the\r\nstranger. Persuaded that she was an enemy, they steered in the direction\r\nof Valparaiso for a couple of days; then considering that she must have\r\nreached her port, were on the point of abandoning the chase, when a gale\r\nblew them out of their course, at the same time bringing them once more in\r\nsight of the unknown vessel, which at first bore down upon them, showing\r\nSpanish colours. She appeared to be a large ship which had mistaken the\r\n_Centurion_ for her consort, and was thought to be one of Pizarro’s\r\nsquadron; this induced Anson to clear the guns of all casks of water or\r\nprovisions which encumbered them, and prepare for action. When near\r\nenough, she was discovered to be only a merchantman, the _Carmelo_,\r\nwithout even as much as a tier of guns. A little later, four shot were\r\nfired among her rigging, on which not one of the crew would venture aloft.\r\nThe ship yielded immediately. When the first lieutenant went on board, he\r\nwas received with abject submission; and the passengers on board,\r\ntwenty-five in number, were terrified at the prospect of the ill-treatment\r\nthey should receive. But Anson was always humane and generous with a\r\nfallen foe, and they were soon re-assured. His kindness was not thrown\r\naway. When at length Captain Cheap and his brother-officers of the wrecked\r\n_Wager_ arrived in Chili (then an appanage of the Spanish Crown) they were\r\nparticularly well treated at Santiago. “We found,” says Byron, “many\r\nSpaniards here that had been taken by Commodore Anson, and had been for\r\nsome time prisoners on board the _Centurion_. They all spoke in the\r\nhighest terms of the kind treatment they had received; and it is natural\r\nto imagine that it was chiefly owing to that laudable example of humanity\r\nour reception here was so good.” They even said that they should not have\r\nbeen sorry had he taken them to England.(16) Anson’s prize on this\r\noccasion had on board large quantities of sugar, cloth, and some little\r\ncotton and tobacco; and in addition, that which was more valuable, several\r\ntrunks of wrought plate, and over _two tons_ of dollars (“twenty-three\r\nserons of dollars, each weighing upwards of 200 lbs. avoirdupois”).\r\n\r\nShortly afterwards, Anson noted two sail, one of which appeared to be “a\r\nvery stout ship,” and which made for them, whilst the other stood off. By\r\nevening they were within pistol-shot of the nearest, “and had a broadside\r\nready to pour into her, the gunners having their matches in their hands,\r\nand only waiting for orders to fire.” The ship was hailed in Spanish, when\r\nthe welcome voice of Mr. Hughes, lieutenant of the _Tryal_, answered in\r\nEnglish that it was a prize taken by him a couple of days before. She had\r\ntried to escape in the night by showing no lights, but an opening or\r\ncrevice in one of the ports had betrayed them. She was a merchantman of\r\nabout 600 tons, and had much the same cargo as that taken by Anson, but\r\nnot so much money on board. Her capture at that moment was invaluable, for\r\nthe _Tryal_ had sprung her mainmast, and was altogether unseaworthy. She\r\nwas condemned, and her crew, guns, and stores, with some additions, were\r\nput on board the prize, now appropriately christened _The Tryal’s Prize_.\r\nThe sloop herself was scuttled and sunk. Shortly afterwards a third prize\r\nwas taken, on which several Spanish lady passengers were found, who hid\r\nthemselves in corners, till assured of honourable and courteous treatment.\r\nAnson ordered that they should retain their own cabins, with all the other\r\nconveniences and privileges they had enjoyed before, and ordered the\r\nSpanish pilot, the second in command, to stay with them as their guardian\r\nand protector. A fourth prize, of little value to the captors, as they\r\ncould not dispose of much of the cargo in any way, but a clear loss to the\r\nSpaniards of 400,000 dollars, was taken a few days afterwards.\r\n\r\nNext followed the capture of Paita, Peru, an important place in those\r\ndays, though it offered little or no resistance. When the sailors in\r\nsearch of private pillage found the clothes of the Spaniards who had fled,\r\nthey were seized with an irresistible impulse to try them on; and soon\r\ntheir dirty unmentionables and jackets were covered by embroidered clothes\r\nand laced hats, not forgetting the bag-wig of the day. Those who could not\r\nfind men’s clothes put on women’s, and half the _Centurion’s_ crew were\r\ntransformed into masqueraders. The town was burned to the ground, after\r\ntreasure, in the shape of plate, dollars, and other coin, to the amount of\r\nupwards of £30,000, had been taken, besides a number of valuable jewels,\r\nand plunder generally, which became the property of the immediate captors.\r\nA vessel in the harbour was taken, and five others scuttled and sunk. The\r\nSpaniards, in their representations sent to the Court of Madrid, estimated\r\ntheir total loss at a million and a half of dollars. After Anson left\r\nPaita, there were dissensions on board regarding the miscellaneous\r\nplunder, between those who had been ordered ashore and those whose duty\r\nobliged them to remain on board. The Commodore ruled that it should be put\r\ninto one common fund, to which he gave his entire share, and then divided\r\nimpartially, in proportion to each man’s rank and commission. To all but a\r\nfew greedy grumblers this was perfectly acceptable, and the discontent,\r\nwhich might easily have been fanned into mutiny, was quashed at once.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: SURRENDER OF THE “CARMELO.”]\r\n\r\nA day or two afterwards, they rejoined the _Gloucester_, and found that\r\nits captain had taken a couple of small prizes, one of them with a cargo\r\nof wine, brandy, and olives in jars, and about £7,000 in specie. The\r\npeople on the other, which was hardly more than a large boat or launch,\r\npleaded poverty, and that their cargo was only cotton. The men on the\r\nbarge had surprised them at dinner upon pigeon pie served on silver\r\ndishes, and suspicion was aroused, which subsided when some little\r\nexamination had been instituted. When the packages, however, were more\r\ncarefully examined on board the _Gloucester_, a considerable quantity of\r\ndoubloons and dollars, to the amount of near £12,000, was discovered\r\nconcealed among the cotton. Before leaving the South American coast, Anson\r\nsent fifty-nine prisoners, in two well-equipped launches taken from his\r\nprizes, to Acapulco, where they arrived safely, and spoke highly of the\r\ntreatment they had received.\r\n\r\nAnson was now on his way to the China Seas, to intercept, if possible, the\r\nManilla galleon, of which he had received some tidings. On the voyage it\r\nbecame necessary to abandon the _Gloucester_. Besides the loss of masts,\r\nwhich were literally rotted out of her, she was tumbling to pieces from\r\nsheer rottenness; and when her captain reported on her condition, she had\r\nseven feet of water in the hold, although his officers and men had been\r\nkept constantly at the pumps for the past twenty-four hours. Her crew had\r\nbecome greatly reduced in numbers, and out of her total complement of\r\nninety-seven, officers included, only sixteen men and eleven boys were\r\ncapable of keeping the deck. The removal of the _Gloucester’s_ people, and\r\nsuch stores as could most easily be taken, occupied two days. It was with\r\ndifficulty that the prize-money taken in the South Seas was secured; the\r\nprize goods were necessarily abandoned. “Their sick men, amounting to\r\nnearly seventy, were conveyed into the boats with as much care as the\r\ncircumstances of that time would permit; but three or four of them expired\r\nas they were hoisting them into the _Centurion_.” The _Gloucester_ was set\r\non fire in the evening, but did not blow up till six o’clock the following\r\nmorning.\r\n\r\nAt Tinian, one of the Ladrone Islands, Anson stopped some time, refreshing\r\nhis worn-out crew, and strengthening the ship. The island abounded in\r\ncattle, hogs, and poultry, running wild; in oranges, limes, lemons,\r\ncocoa-nuts, and bread-fruit. “The country did by no means resemble that of\r\nan uninhabited and uncultivated place; but had much more the air of a\r\nmagnificent plantation, where large lawns and stately woods had been laid\r\nout together with great skill, and where the whole had been so artfully\r\ncombined, and so judiciously adapted to the slopes of the hills and the\r\ninequalities of the ground, as to produce a most striking effect, and to\r\ndo honour to the invention of the contriver.” These compliments to Nature\r\nmay often be paralleled in writers of the last century. When they had\r\ndropped anchor, such was the weakness of the crew that it took them five\r\nhours to furl their sails. “All the hands we could muster capable of\r\nstanding at a gun,” says the narrator, “amounted to no more than\r\nseventy-one, most of whom, too, were incapable of duty, except on the\r\ngreatest emergencies. This, inconsiderable as it may appear, was the whole\r\nforce we could collect in our present enfeebled condition from the united\r\ncrews of the _Centurion_, the _Gloucester_, and the _Tryal_, which, when\r\nwe departed from England, consisted of near a thousand hands.” Some\r\nIndians ashore fled when they landed, leaving their huts, one of which,\r\nused as a large storehouse, was converted into a hospital for the sick,\r\none hundred and twenty-eight in number. Numbers of these were so helpless\r\nthat they had to be carried from the boats, the commodore assisting, as he\r\nhad before at Juan Fernandez, and the officers following suit. The poor\r\ninvalids soon felt the benefit of the abundant fresh fruits and water; and\r\nalthough twenty-one were buried in the first and succeeding day, they did\r\nnot lose above ten more during the two months of their stay at the island.\r\n\r\nOne of the drawbacks of a stay at Tinian was the roadstead, which, with\r\nits coral bottom, afforded a bad anchorage during the western monsoons.\r\nThis was convincingly proved to the people of the _Centurion_. In the\r\nthird week of September the wind blew with such fury that all\r\ncommunication with the shore was cut off, as no boat could live in the sea\r\nraised by it. The small bower cable, and afterwards their best bower,\r\nparted. The waves broke over the devoted ship, and the long-boat, at that\r\ntime moored astern, was on a sudden canted so high that it broke the\r\ntransom of the commodore’s cabin on the quarter-deck, and was itself stove\r\nto pieces, the poor boat-keeper, though extremely bruised, being saved\r\nalmost by a miracle. The end of all this was that the ship was driven to\r\nsea, leaving Anson, several officers, and a great part of the crew on\r\nshore, amounting in the whole to one hundred and thirteen persons. The\r\npoor wretches on the ship expected each moment to be their last, as they\r\nwere altogether too few and weak to work a large vessel.\r\n\r\n“The storm which drove the _Centurion_ to sea blew with too much\r\nturbulence to permit either the commodore or any of the people on shore to\r\nhear the guns which she fired as signals of distress; and the frequent\r\nglare of the lightning had prevented the explosions from being observed;\r\nso that when at daybreak it was perceived from the shore that the ship was\r\nmissing, there was the utmost consternation amongst them, for much the\r\ngreatest part of them immediately concluded that she was lost.” Anson,\r\nwhatever he thought himself, did all in his power to reason them out of\r\nthe idea, and immediately proposed that if she did not return in a few\r\ndays they should cut in half a small bark, a Spanish prize they had taken,\r\nand lengthen her about twelve feet, which would enable her to carry them\r\nall to China. After some days the men began to consider this their only\r\nchance, and worked zealously at their allotted employments. These were\r\ninterrupted one day by “A sail!” being announced. Presently a second was\r\ndescried, which quite destroyed the conjecture that it was the ship\r\nherself. The revulsion of feeling in Anson’s bosom was so strong, that for\r\nonce he was quite unmanned, and retired to his tent, with the bitter\r\nfeeling that now he could not hope to signalise the expedition by any\r\ngreat exploit. He was, however, soon relieved by finding that the boats\r\nwere Indian proas, which, after cruising off the island for a time,\r\nsuddenly departed, and were lost to sight. The recital of the details\r\nconnected with the transformation of the bark would be tedious; suffice it\r\nto say, that they had to manufacture many of the necessary tools, cut down\r\ntrees, and saw them into planks, and dig a dry dock, while others were\r\nemployed in collecting provisions. They were much mortified to find that\r\nall the powder ashore did not amount to more than ninety charges. What if\r\nthe Spaniards should appear at this juncture?\r\n\r\nHowever, in spite of all obstacles, they had proceeded so far with their\r\nwork as to have fixed upon a date for their departure from the island.\r\n“But their project and labours were now drawing to speedier and happier\r\nconclusion; for, on the 11th of October, in the afternoon, one of the\r\n_Gloucester’s_ men, being upon a hill in the middle of the island,\r\nperceived the _Centurion_ at a distance, and, running down with his utmost\r\nspeed towards the landing-place, he in the way saw some of his comrades,\r\nto whom he hallooed out with great ecstasy, ‘The ship! the ship!’” It was\r\nindeed the ship; and when Anson heard of it, we can well believe that he\r\nbroke through “the equable and unvaried character” he had hitherto\r\npreserved. The men were in a perfect state of frenzy. A boat with eighteen\r\nmen, and fresh meats and fruits, was sent off to the _Centurion_, which\r\ncame to anchor next day. She had been nearly three weeks absent. The\r\nchaplain who has left us the narrative of Anson’s voyage was on board at\r\nthe time. He describes their deplorable condition in a leaky ship, with\r\nthree cables hanging loose, from one of which dragged their only remaining\r\nanchor; not a gun lashed or port closed; shrouds loose, and topmasts\r\nunrigged, and no sails which could be set except the mizen. The pumps\r\nalone gave employment for the whole of the available crew. “In these\r\nexigencies,” says he, “no rank or office exempted any person from the\r\nmanual application and bodily labour of a common sailor. They eventually\r\nraised their sheet anchor, which had been dragging at the bows, got up\r\ntheir mainyard, and generally got the ship in something like sailing trim.\r\nThey were quite as rejoiced to see the island once more as were their\r\ncompanions to see them.”\r\n\r\nAfter a long stay at Macao, where the Chinese officials put all kinds of\r\nobstacles in the way of refitting and provisioning his ship, Anson set\r\nsail for the express purpose of intercepting the Manilla galleon or\r\ngalleons, which, indeed, had been the object of his long cruise off Mexico\r\nand South America. The annual ship plying between Acapulco and Manilla,\r\nand _vice versâ_, was always richly laden with the best the Spanish\r\ncolonies afforded, and all on board the _Centurion_ were now eager for the\r\nfray. Anson determined to lay off Cape Spiritu Santo, Samal (one of the\r\nPhilippine group of islands), as the galleons always made that land first\r\non the voyage to Manilla. It was a month after they had gained the station\r\nthat the coveted prize hove in sight. “On this a general joy spread\r\nthrough the whole ship.” The Spaniards had determined to risk the fight,\r\nand it is needless to say that Anson was ready for them. He picked out\r\nabout thirty of his choicest marksmen, whom he distributed among the tops,\r\nand they eventually did great execution. “As he had not hands enough\r\nremaining to quarter a sufficient number to each great gun in the\r\ncustomary manner, he therefore on his lower tier fixed only two men to\r\neach gun, who were to be solely employed in loading it, whilst the rest of\r\nhis people were divided into different gangs of ten or twelve men each,\r\nwho were continually moving about the decks, to run out and fire such guns\r\nas were loaded. By this management he was enabled to make use of all his\r\nguns; and instead of whole broadsides, with intervals between them, he\r\nkept up a constant fire without intermission; whence he doubted not to\r\nprocure very signal advantages. For it is common with the Spaniards to\r\nfall down upon the decks when they see a broadside preparing, and to\r\ncontinue in that posture till it is given; after which they rise again,\r\nand presuming the danger to be for some time over, work their guns and\r\nfire with great briskness, till another broadside is ready; but the firing\r\ngun by gun, in the manner directed by the commodore, rendered this\r\npractice of theirs impossible.” Several squalls of wind and rain about\r\nnoon often obscured the galleon from their sight; but when the weather\r\ncleared up she was observed resolutely lying to, waiting her impending\r\ndoom. Towards one o’clock the _Centurion_ hoisted her colours, the enemy\r\nbeing within gunshot. Anson noted that the Spaniards had neglected to\r\nclear the decks, as they were still engaged in throwing overboard cattle\r\nand lumber; and as all is supposed to be fair in war, he determined to\r\nworry them at once, and ordered the chase-guns to be fired into them. The\r\ngalleon returned the fire with two of her stern chase-guns; “and the\r\n_Centurion_ getting her sprit-sail-yard fore and aft, that if necessary\r\nshe might be ready for boarding, the Spaniards, in a bravado, rigged their\r\nsprit-sail-yard fore and aft likewise. Soon after, the _Centurion_ came\r\nabreast of the enemy, within pistol-shot, keeping to the leeward of them,\r\nwith a view of preventing their putting before the wind, and gaining the\r\nport of Talapay, from which they were about seven leagues distant. And now\r\nthe engagement began in earnest, and for the first half-hour Mr. Anson\r\nover-reached the galleon, and lay on her bow, where, by the great wideness\r\nof his ports, he could traverse almost all his guns upon the enemy, whilst\r\nthe galleon could only bring a part of hers to bear. Immediately on the\r\ncommencement of the action, the mats with which the galleon had stuffed\r\nher netting took fire, and burnt violently, blazing up half as high as the\r\nmizen-top. This accident, supposed to be caused by the _Centurion’s_ wads,\r\nthrew the enemy into the utmost terror, and also alarmed the commodore,\r\nfor he feared lest the galleon should be burnt, and lest he himself might\r\nsuffer by her driving on board him. However, the Spaniards at last freed\r\nthemselves from the fire by cutting away the netting, and tumbling the\r\nwhole mass which was in flames into the sea. All this interval, the\r\n_Centurion_ kept her first advantageous position, firing her cannon with\r\ngreat regularity and briskness; whilst at the same time the galleon’s\r\ndecks lay open to her top-men, who, having at their first volley driven\r\nthe Spaniards from their tops, made prodigious havoc with their\r\nsmall-arms, killing or wounding every officer but one that appeared on the\r\nquarter-deck, and wounding in particular the general of the galleon\r\nhimself.”\r\n\r\nThen for a little the _Centurion_ lost the superiority of her original\r\nposition; but still her grape-shot raked the Spaniard’s decks with such\r\ncruel precision that they were covered with the dead and dying,\r\nencumbering the movements of those still fighting, who kept up as brisk a\r\nfire as they could. But the general himself was pretty nearly _hors de\r\ncombat_, while the Spanish officers were rushing hither and thither,\r\nendeavouring vainly to keep the now disheartened men at their posts. They\r\nmade one last effort, pointed and fired five or six guns with more\r\nprecision than usual, and then yielded the contest. The galleon’s colours\r\nhad been singed off the ensign-staff in the beginning of the engagement,\r\nso she had to haul down the royal standard from her main-top-gallant-mast\r\nhead, “the person who was employed to perform this office having been in\r\nimminent peril of being killed, had not the commodore, who perceived what\r\nhe was about, given express orders to his people to desist from firing.”\r\nAnd so the great _Nostra Signora de Cabadonga_ became Anson’s prize.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: ANSON TAKING THE SPANISH GALLEON.]\r\n\r\nAnd she was indeed a prize. She had on board 35,682 ounces of virgin\r\nsilver, 1,313,843 pieces of eight, besides some cochineal and other\r\ntrifles, which hardly counted in comparison with the specie. She was a\r\nmuch larger vessel than the _Centurion_, and had five hundred and fifty\r\nmen, and thirty-six large guns, besides twenty-eight pedreroes each\r\ncarrying four-pound balls. During the action she had sixty-seven men\r\nkilled, and eighty-four wounded; whilst the _Centurion_ had only two\r\nkilled, and seventeen wounded. Shortly after the galleon had struck, an\r\nofficer came quietly to Anson, and told him the ship was on fire near the\r\npowder-room. The commodore showed no emotion, and gave orders to a few in\r\nregard to extinguishing it, which was happily done, without alarming the\r\ncrew or informing the enemy. The galleon was constituted by Anson a\r\npost-ship in his Majesty’s navy, the command being given to his first\r\nlieutenant, Mr. Saumarez. All but the officers and wounded of the\r\nprisoners were kept in the hold of the _Centurion_, two guarded hatchways\r\nbeing left open. As the Spaniards were two to one of the English, every\r\nprecaution was necessary, but otherwise they were treated as well as\r\npossible. Unfortunately their allowance of water was necessarily small,\r\none pint per day, the crew only receiving a pint and a half; and although\r\nnot one died on the passage to the river of Canton, they were reduced to\r\nghastly skeletons when they were discharged. Anson refitted and sold the\r\ngalleon to the merchants of Macao, and, with about £400,000 worth of\r\nSpanish treasure, sailed for England, where he arrived in safety. The\r\ndamage done by him to Spain was probably three or four times that\r\nrepresented by the above amount. The great galleon was alone, with her\r\ncargo, valued at a million and a half dollars; whilst the destruction of\r\nPaita, and the minor Spanish prizes, with large parts of their cargoes,\r\nwere serious losses to Spain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE HISTORY OF SHIPS AND SHIPPING INTERESTS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n          Progress of the American Colonies—Great Prevalence of\r\n        Piracy—Numerous Captures and Executions—A Proclamation of\r\n             Pardon—John Theach, or “Black Beard”—A Desperate\r\n    Pirate—Hand-and-glove with the Governor of North Carolina—Pretends\r\n     to accept the King’s Pardon—A Blind—His Defeat and Death—Unwise\r\n       Legislation and consequent Irritation—The Stamp Act—The Tea\r\n          Tax—Enormous Excitement—Tea-chests thrown into Boston\r\n     Harbour—Determined Attitude of the American Colonists—The Boston\r\n         Port Bill—Its Effects—Sympathy of all America—The final\r\n     Rupture—England’s Wars to the end of the Century—Nelson and the\r\n                        Nile—Battle of Copenhagen.\r\n\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the eighteenth century, while Europe was\r\ndistracted by war, the American colonies were, “by peaceful and\r\nundisturbed pursuits, laying the foundation of that prosperity which\r\nenabled them, before the close of the century, to demand and obtain their\r\nseverance from the mother country, and their social and political\r\nindependence.” So early as 1729, Philadelphia had 6,000 tons of shipping,\r\nand received in that year 6,208 emigrants from Great Britain. New York was\r\nthen carrying on a large trade in grain and provisions with Spain and\r\nPortugal, besides forwarding considerable quantities of furs to England.\r\nNew England was furnishing the finest spars and masts in the world, while\r\nthat part of it which is now the State of Massachusetts had already\r\n120,000 inhabitants, employing 40,000 tons of shipping, or about 600\r\nvessels of all sizes. The fisheries were of great value, as much as a\r\nquarter of a million quintals of dried fish being annually exported to\r\nSpain, Portugal, and the Mediterranean. Carolina was doing a magnificent\r\nbusiness in the export of rice, Indian corn, and provisions of all kinds;\r\nin pitch, turpentine, and lumber.\r\n\r\nBut one serious evil caused the colonists great annoyance and loss—the\r\nprevalence of piracy. The State last named suffered far more than the\r\nrest. Commercial restrictions, unwisely imposed by Great Britain, gave\r\nrise to a large amount of smuggling, and from smuggling to piracy was an\r\neasy transition. “These gangs of naval robbers were likewise frequently\r\nrecruited by British sailors, who had been trained to ferocity and\r\ninjustice by the legalised piracy of the slave-trade.”(17) One Captain\r\nQuelch, the commander of a vessel which had committed numerous piracies,\r\nventured to take shelter, with his crew, in Massachusetts in the year\r\n1704. He was detected, tried, and hanged, with six of his accomplices, in\r\nBoston. In 1717 several vessels were captured on the coasts of New England\r\nby a noted pirate, Captain Bellamy, a man who carried matters with a high\r\nhand, having a vessel with twenty-three guns, and a crew of one hundred\r\nand thirty men. The vessel was wrecked shortly afterwards on Cape Cod, the\r\ncaptain and the whole of his crew, except six, perishing in the waves. The\r\npitiful remainder gained the shore, their fate literally realising Defoe’s\r\nwords—\r\n\r\n  “When what the sea would not, the gallows may;”\r\n\r\nfor they were immediately conveyed to Boston, tried, and executed. A\r\nnumber of pirates were about the same time hanged in Virginia. In\r\nconsequence of the repeated complaints of British merchants regarding\r\nthese freebooters, George I. issued a proclamation offering a pardon to\r\nall pirates who should surrender to any of the colonial governors within\r\ntwelve months; and in 1718 dispatched a few ships of war under Captain\r\nRogers, who, repairing to New Providence, then a perfect den of\r\nsea-thieves, took possession of the place, and nearly all the pirates\r\nthere took the benefit of the royal proclamation. Steed Bennet and Richard\r\nWorley, two pirate chiefs who had fled from New Providence at the approach\r\nof Rogers, took possession of the mouth of Cape Fear River. They were\r\ncaptured by Governor Johnson and Captain Rhett; and Bennet, who was a man\r\nof good education, and had held the rank of major in the British army, was\r\nexecuted at Charlestown, with forty-one of his accomplices. North Carolina\r\nhad been for a long time the haunt of one of the most desperate villains\r\nof his time, John Theach, generally known as “Black Beard,” from an\r\nenormous beard he wore, and which was adjusted, Grahame records, “with\r\nelaborate care in such an inhuman disposition as was calculated to excite\r\nboth disgust and terror.... In battle, he has been represented with the\r\nlook and demeanour of a fury; carrying three braces of pistols on holsters\r\nslung over his shoulders, and lighted matches under his hat, protruding\r\nover each of his ears. The authority and admiration which the pirate\r\nchiefs enjoyed among their fellows was proportioned to the audacity and\r\nextravagance of their outrages on humanity; and none in this respect ever\r\nchallenged a rivalship with Theach.... Having frequently undertaken to\r\npersonify a demon for the entertainment of his followers, he declared at\r\nlength his purpose of gratifying them with an anticipated representation\r\nof hell; and in this attempt had nearly stifled the whole crew with the\r\nfumes of brimstone under the hatches of his vessel. In one of his\r\necstasies, whilst heated with liquor, and sitting in his cabin, he took a\r\npistol in each hand, and, cocking them under the table, blew out the\r\nlights, and then with crossed hands fired on each side at his companions,\r\none of whom received a shot that maimed him for life.” He was an early\r\nMormon, for he had fourteen women whom he called his wives. His chief\r\nsecurity had been the fact that Charles Eden, the governor, and Tobias\r\nKnight, the secretary of the province, shared in his plunder and protected\r\nhim. As he was rich, and had been apprised of Rogers’ operations at New\r\nProvidence, he judged it wise to accept the benefit of the king’s\r\nproclamation, and, with twenty of his men, pretended to surrender to Eden,\r\nwho had been a receiver of goods or gold stolen by him.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: CAPE COD.]\r\n\r\nThis was, however, only a blind. He fitted out almost immediately\r\nafterwards a sloop, which he entered at the Custom House as a regular\r\ntrader. In a few weeks he returned to North Carolina, bringing with him a\r\nFrench ship in a state of perfect soundness, and with a valuable cargo on\r\nboard, which he deposed on oath that he had found deserted at sea, a\r\nstatement which quite satisfied Eden and Knight. Nobody else believed him,\r\nand some of the Carolinians who had suffered by his hands appealed to the\r\nGovernment of Virginia for aid in hunting down this pest of humanity.\r\nMaynard, the lieutenant of a ship of war, was dispatched after him, found\r\nhim in Pamlico Sound, and, after a close encounter, prevailed. “Foreboding\r\ndefeat, Theach had posted one of his followers with a lighted match over\r\nhis powder magazine, that in the last extremity he might defraud human\r\njustice of a part of its retributive triumph. But some accident or mistake\r\nprevented the execution of this act of despair. Theach himself, surrounded\r\nby slaughtered foes and followers, and bleeding from numerous wounds, in\r\nthe act of stepping back to cock a pistol, fainted from loss of blood, and\r\nexpired on the spot.” The few survivors threw down their swords, and were\r\nspared—to die on the gallows shortly afterwards. Piracy was checked, but\r\nnot obliterated, by these means; and about five years after this period no\r\nless than twenty-six of these “sea rats” were executed in Rhode Island.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: THE “DARTMOUTH” IN BOSTON HARBOUR.]\r\n\r\nThis not being a history of America, the writer is spared all allusion to\r\nevents of the period except so far as they bear on the sea and maritime\r\nmatters. One of the greatest among a long series of mistakes made at the\r\ntime by Great Britain was an expedient, ascribed to George Grenville,\r\nintended to strike a death-blow at smuggling. All the commanders and other\r\nofficers of British ships of war stationed off the American coasts, or\r\ncruising in the American seas, now received injunctions and authority from\r\nthe Crown to act as officers of the customs; they were compelled to take\r\nthe usual oaths of office administered to the civil functionaries ashore;\r\nand, to reconcile them to what they might think a service degrading to\r\nthem, they were to receive an ample share of contraband and confiscated\r\ncargoes. It must be remembered that they were totally ignorant of the laws\r\nwhich they were now required not merely to guard, but to administer; and\r\nthey had not the restraints of the ordinary Custom House officials, for\r\nwhatever wrong they might commit, no nearer redress was open to the\r\nsufferer than an appeal to the Admiralty or Treasury of England. Many\r\ncargoes were unjustly confiscated, and a number of others unreasonably\r\ndetained, to the great detriment of the owners; “and in several instances\r\nthese violations of justice were ascribed rather to eager cupidity and\r\nconfidence of impunity than to involuntary error.” In other words, the\r\nlegitimate merchant was often put in the same box as though he had been a\r\npirate or smuggler. A traffic had long sprung up between the British and\r\nSpanish colonies of North and South America, advantageous to both. The\r\nsame existed, in a lesser degree, between America and the French West\r\nIndia Islands. These new auxiliaries of the Custom House now and again\r\nseized indiscriminately and confiscated the ships, American or foreign,\r\nengaged in this trade. Meantime, the Government at home, ill-informed as\r\nit was, learned that there was much discontent in America, and hastened to\r\nrepair the damage by passing a special Act of Parliament, declaring the\r\nlegitimacy of the commerce between the American colonies and those of\r\nFrance and Spain. Unfortunately, they at the same time loaded the more\r\nvaluable articles with duties which were nearly prohibitive, and must\r\nencourage smuggling.\r\n\r\nThen came the passage of the Stamp Act, which was to tax every paper of a\r\ncommercial, legal, or social nature, and which was so unpopular that the\r\nmerchants of New York directed their correspondents in England to ship no\r\nmore goods to them till it should be repealed. The people very generally\r\nagreed to confine their purchases to native productions. “I will wear\r\nnothing but homespun!” exclaimed one angry citizen. “I will drink no\r\nwine,” echoed another, angry that wine must pay a new duty. “I propose,”\r\ncried a third, “that we dress in sheepskins, with the wool on.”(18) To\r\nencourage a woollen manufacture in America, it was recommended to the\r\ncolonists to abstain from eating the flesh of lambs, and not a butcher\r\ndurst afterwards expose lamb for sale. Its operations were ushered in at\r\nBoston by the tolling of bells; effigies of the authors and abettors were\r\ncarried about the streets, and afterwards torn in pieces by the populace.\r\nAt Portsmouth, New Hampshire, a funeral procession was organised, and a\r\ncoffin bearing the inscription, “LIBERTY, AGED CXLV. YEARS,” was paraded,\r\namidst the booming of minute guns, and the roll of muffled drums. An\r\noration was made over a grave prepared for its reception, at the\r\nconclusion of which some remains of life were, it was pretended,\r\ndiscovered in the body, which was thereupon snatched from the grave. The\r\ninscription was altered to “LIBERTY REVIVED,” and a cheerful and hilarious\r\nprocession then marched off with it. In several instances the residences\r\nof the governors, officials, and tax-collectors of States were burned to\r\nthe ground, or greatly damaged. So strong was the current of popular will\r\nthat the Custom House officers did not, in a large number of cases,\r\nattempt to stamp the clearances of vessels sailing. The law courts\r\nremained open, and ignored the want of stamps on legal documents, and\r\nmarriages were consummated simply after putting up the banns, and not by\r\nstamped certificate. The almost total suspension of business with English\r\nshippers and merchants alarmed them greatly, and they were among the first\r\nto petition for its repeal. In Parliament, among many others, Pitt was a\r\nwarm friend to the American cause. In answer to a taunting speech from\r\nGrenville, he replied: “We are told that America is obstinate—that America\r\nis almost in open rebellion. _Sir, I rejoice that America has resisted._\r\nThree millions of people so dead to all the feelings of liberty as\r\nvoluntarily to submit to be slaves, would have been fit instruments to\r\nmake slaves of all the rest.” The Stamp Act was repealed March 19th, 1766,\r\nand in London itself was received with so much joy, that there was a\r\ngeneral illumination, amid the ringing of church bells; and in America it\r\nwas hailed with satisfaction, although subsequent action on the part of\r\nthe English Government soon obliterated all memory of the concession.\r\n\r\nPassing over political complications which led to the American Revolution,\r\nwe must allude to the Tea Tax, the resistance to which was as strong as to\r\nany previous measure of our misguided Government. The Government decided\r\nto enforce it, although they were aware of its unpopularity, and the East\r\nIndia Company, which had the vast stock of 17,000,000 lbs. on hand,\r\nfreighted several of their ships to America. Mark the result.(19)\r\n\r\nOn the 28th November, 1773, the ship _Dartmouth_ appeared in Boston\r\nHarbour with one hundred and fourteen chests of the East India Company’s\r\ntea. To keep the Sabbath strictly was the New England usage. But hours\r\nwere precious; let the tea be entered, and it would be beyond the power of\r\nthe consignee to send it back. The Select men held one meeting by day, and\r\nanother in the evening, but they sought in vain for the consignees, who\r\nhad taken sanctuary in the castle.\r\n\r\nThe Committee of Correspondence was more efficient. They met also on\r\nSunday; and obtained from the Quaker, Potch, who owned the _Dartmouth_, a\r\npromise not to enter his ship till Tuesday; and authorised Samuel Adams to\r\ninvite the Committees of the five surrounding towns, Dorchester, Roxbury,\r\nBrookline, Cambridge, and Charlestown, with their own townsmen and those\r\nof Boston, to hold a mass meeting the next morning. Faneuil Hall could not\r\ncontain the people that poured in on Monday. The concourse was the largest\r\never known. Adjourning to “The Old South” Meeting House, on the motion of\r\nSamuel Adams, the assembly, composed of five thousand persons, resolved,\r\nunanimously, that “the tea should be sent back to the place from whence it\r\ncame at all events, and that no duty should be paid on it.” “The only way\r\nto get rid of it,” said Mr. Young, “is to throw it overboard.” The\r\nconsignees asked for time to prepare their answer; and, “out of great\r\ntenderness,” the body postponed proceeding with it till the next morning.\r\nMeantime the owner and master of the ship were _convented_, and forced to\r\npromise not to land the tea. A watch was also proposed. “I,” said Hancock,\r\n“will be one of it, rather than that there should be none;” and a party of\r\ntwenty-five persons, under the orders of Edward Proctor as its captain,\r\nwas appointed to guard the tea-ship during the night.\r\n\r\nThe next morning the consignees jointly gave in their answer:—“It is\r\nutterly impossible to send back the teas; but we now declare to you our\r\nreadiness to store them, until we shall receive further directions from\r\nour constituents!”—that is, until they could notify the British\r\nGovernment. The wrath of the meeting was kindling, when the Sheriff of\r\nSuffolk entered with a proclamation from the governor, warning the\r\nassembly to disperse. The notice was received with hisses, derision, and a\r\nunanimous vote not to disperse. In the afternoon Potch, the owner, and\r\nHall, the master, of the _Dartmouth_, yielding to an irresistible impulse,\r\nengaged that the tea should return as it came, without touching land or\r\npaying duty. A similar promise was exacted of the owners of the other\r\ntea-ships, whose arrival was daily expected. In this way “it was thought\r\nthe matter would have ended.” Every shipowner was forbidden, on pain of\r\nbeing deemed an enemy to the country, to import or bring as freight any\r\ntea from Great Britain, till the unrighteous Act taxing it should be\r\nrepealed; and this vote was printed and sent to every seaport in the\r\nProvince, and to England. Six persons were chosen as foot-riders, to give\r\ndue notice to the country towns of any attempt to land the tea by force;\r\nand the Committee of Correspondence, as the executive organ of the\r\nmeeting, took care that a military watch was regularly kept up by\r\nvolunteers armed with muskets and bayonets, who at every half-hour in the\r\nnight regularly passed the word “All is well!” like sentinels in a\r\ngarrison. Had they been molested in the night, the tolling of the bells\r\nwould have been the signal for a general uprising.\r\n\r\nThe ships, after landing the rest of their cargo, could neither be cleared\r\nin Boston with the tea on board, nor be entered in England, and on the\r\ntwentieth day from their arrival would be liable to seizure.\r\n\r\nThe spirit of the people rose with the emergency. Two more tea-ships which\r\narrived were directed to anchor by the side of the _Dartmouth_, at\r\nGriffin’s Wharf, that one guard might serve for all. In the meantime the\r\nconsignees conspired with the Revenue officers to throw on the owner and\r\nmaster of the _Dartmouth_ the whole burden of landing the tea, and would\r\nneither agree to receive it, nor give up their bill of lading, nor pay the\r\nfreight. Every movement was duly reported, and the town became as furious\r\nas in the time of the Stamp Act. On the 9th there was a vast gathering at\r\nNewburyport, of the inhabitants of that and the neighbouring towns, and\r\nthey unanimously agreed to assist Boston, even at the hazard of their\r\nlives. “This is not a piece of parade,” they say, “but if an occasion\r\nshall offer, a goodly number from among us will hasten to join you.”\r\n\r\nIn this state of things it was easily seen by the people of Boston that,\r\nthe ships lying so near, the teas would be landed by degrees,\r\nnotwithstanding any guard they could keep or measures taken to prevent it;\r\nand it was as well known that if they were landed nothing could prevent\r\ntheir being sold, and thereby the purpose of establishing the monopoly and\r\nraising a revenue fulfilled.\r\n\r\nThe morning of Thursday, the 16th of December, 1773, dawned upon Boston, a\r\nday by far the most momentous in its annals. The town of Portsmouth held\r\nits meeting on that morning, and, with six only protesting, its people\r\nadopted the principles of Philadelphia, appointed their Committee of\r\nCorrespondence, and resolved to make common cause with the Colonies. At\r\nten o’clock the people of Boston, with at least two thousand men from the\r\ncountry, assembled in the Old South. A report was made that Potch (the\r\nowner of the _Dartmouth_) had been refused a clearance from the collector.\r\n“Then,” said they to him, “protest immediately against the Custom House,\r\nand apply to the governor for his pass, so that your vessel may this very\r\nday proceed on her voyage to London.”\r\n\r\nThe governor had stolen away to his country house at Milton. Bidding Potch\r\nmake all haste, the meeting adjourned to three in the afternoon. At that\r\nhour Potch had not returned. It was incidentally voted, as other towns had\r\nalready done, to abstain totally from the use of tea. Then, since the\r\ngovernor might refuse his pass, the momentous question recurred, “Whether\r\nit be the sense and determination of this body to abide by their former\r\nresolutions, with respect to the not suffering the tea to be landed?”\r\nAfter hearing addresses from Adams, Young, the younger Quincy, and others,\r\nthe whole assembly of seven thousand voted unanimously, that the tea\r\nshould not be landed.\r\n\r\nIt had been dark for more than an hour. The church in which they met was\r\ndimly lighted; when, at a quarter before six, Potch appeared, and\r\nsatisfied the people by relating that the governor had refused him a pass,\r\nbecause his ship was not properly cleared. As soon as he had finished his\r\nreport, Samuel Adams rose and gave the word: “This meeting can do nothing\r\nmore to save the country!” On the instant a shout was heard at the porch;\r\nthe war-whoop resounded; a body of men, forty or fifty in number,\r\ndisguised as Indians, passed by the door, and, encouraged by Samuel Adams,\r\nHancock, and others, repaired to Griffin’s Wharf, posted guards to prevent\r\nthe intrusion of spies, took possession of the three tea-ships, and in\r\nabout three hours three hundred and forty chests of tea, being the whole\r\nquantity that had been imported, were emptied into the bay, without the\r\nleast injury to other property. All things were conducted with great\r\norder, decency, and perfect submission to Government. The people around,\r\nas they looked on, were so still that the noise of breaking open the\r\ntea-chests was plainly heard.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: DESTRUCTION OF THE TEA CARGOES.]\r\n\r\nIn Philadelphia, when a tea-ship arrived, the captain fearing the loss of\r\nhis cargo, agreed to sail back again the following day.\r\n\r\nDuring the whole period of her controversy with Great Britain, America was\r\nderiving a constant increase of strength, not merely from domestic growth,\r\nbut by the immense volume of emigration from Europe. No complete record\r\nremains of its amount, but sufficient facts are known to show how vast it\r\nhad become. “Within the first fortnight of August, 1773, there arrived at\r\nPhiladelphia 3,500 emigrants from Ireland; and from the same document\r\nwhich has recorded this circumstance, it appears that vessels were\r\narriving every month freighted with emigrants from Holland, Germany, and\r\nespecially from Ireland and the Highlands of Scotland. About 700 Irish\r\nsettlers repaired to the Carolinas in the autumn of 1773; and in the\r\ncourse of the same season no fewer than ten vessels sailed from Britain\r\nwith Scottish Highlanders emigrating to the American States.” Connecticut\r\nin ten years gained 50,000 in population, and when the final rupture\r\noccurred with the mother country, the United States had already reached\r\nthe important number of about three and a quarter millions, or say a good\r\nmillion over the united populations of the Australasian colonies of\r\nto-day, including New Zealand. And it must never be forgotten that of the\r\nnew-comers a large proportion were flying from grievances at home to which\r\nthey could no longer submit, and that they therefore added to and fanned\r\nthe discontent prevailing in America. In view of such facts the action of\r\nthe home Government is nearly inexplicable.\r\n\r\nWhen the intelligence of the destruction of the tea reached England,\r\nalthough it was obvious that the opposition which had been shown was\r\ncommon to all the colonies, it was determined to make an example of\r\nBoston. “It was reckoned that a partial blow might be dealt to America\r\nwith much greater severity than could be prudently exacted in more\r\nextensive punishment; and it was, doubtless, expected that the Americans\r\nin general, without being provoked by personal suffering, would be struck\r\nwith terror by the rigour inflicted on a city so long renowned as the\r\nbulwark of their liberties. Without even the decent formality of requiring\r\nthe inhabitants of Boston to exculpate themselves, but definitely assuming\r\ntheir guilt in conformity with the despatches of a governor who was\r\nnotoriously at enmity with them, the Ministers introduced into Parliament\r\na bill for suspending the trade and closing the harbour of Boston during\r\nthe pleasure of the king. They declared that the duration of this severity\r\nwould depend entirely upon the conduct of the objects of it; for it would\r\ndoubtless be relaxed as soon as the people of Boston should make\r\ncompensation for the tea that had been destroyed, and otherwise satisfy\r\nthe king of their sincere purpose to render due submission to his\r\nGovernment.” The bill encountered little or no opposition in Parliament, a\r\nfew members only contending that milder measures should be tried. It is\r\nimpossible to imagine such an occasion to-day. Think of the ports of\r\nSydney or Melbourne, for example, being closed to all trade and commerce\r\nfrom outside, and hundreds of vessels prevented from unloading or loading\r\nthere, because of irritation prevailing among the Australians, entirely\r\nproduced by unwise legislation, and unjust taxation on the part of the\r\nmother country. Yet this is what was done with our American colonies\r\nlittle more than a hundred years ago.\r\n\r\nMark what followed. On the arrival of the first copy of the Boston Port\r\nBill a town meeting was convened in that city, and it was recommended,\r\n“That all commercial intercourse whatever with Britain and the West Indies\r\nshould be renounced by the American States till the repeal of the Act.” At\r\nPhiladelphia a liberal subscription was made for the relief of such of the\r\npoorer inhabitants of Boston whose livelihood had been ruined by this\r\narbitrary proceeding. The Virginian House of Burgesses appointed the date\r\non which the operation of the Act was to commence as a day of fasting,\r\nhumiliation, and prayer.\r\n\r\nOn the 1st of June, 1774, the operation of the Boston Port Bill commenced.\r\nAll the commercial business of the capital of Massachusetts was concluded\r\nat noon, and the harbour of this flourishing port was closed—till the\r\ngathering storm of the Revolution was to re-open it. “At Williamsburgh, in\r\nVirginia, the day was devoutly consecrated to the religious exercises\r\nwhich had been recommended by the Assembly. At Philadelphia it was\r\nsolemnised by a great majority of the population with every testimonial of\r\npublic grief; all the inhabitants, except the Quakers, shut up their\r\nhouses; and after divine service a deep and ominous silence reigned\r\nthrough the city. In other parts of America it was also observed as a day\r\nof mourning; and the sentiments thus widely awakened were kept alive and\r\nexasperated by the distress to which the inhabitants of Boston were\r\nreduced from the continued operation of the Port Bill, and by the\r\nfortitude with which they endured it. The rents of all the land-holders in\r\nand around Boston now ceased, or were greatly diminished; all the wealth\r\nwhich had been vested in warehouses and wharfs was rendered unproductive;\r\nfrom the merchants was wrested the commerce which they had reared, and the\r\nmeans alike of providing for their families and paying their debts; all\r\nthe artificers employed in the numerous occupations created by an\r\nextensive trade shared the general hardships; and a great majority of that\r\nclass of the community who earned daily bread by their daily labour were\r\ndeprived of the means of support.” The sympathy shown by the sister\r\ncolonies was highly creditable, and often took the form of substantial\r\nrelief. The inhabitants of Marblehead offered to the Boston merchants the\r\nuse of their harbours, wharfs, and warehouses, together with their\r\npersonal services in lading and unlading goods, free of all expense. The\r\ncitizens of Salem (in the same State as Boston) concluded a remonstrance\r\nagainst the British measures as follows:—“By shutting up the port of\r\nBoston, some imagine that the course of trade might be turned hither, and\r\nto our benefit.... We must be lost to every idea of justice, and dead to\r\nall the feelings of humanity, could we indulge one thought of raising our\r\nfortunes on the ruins of our suffering neighbours.” A country so\r\nthoroughly bound together surely deserved the independence which a couple\r\nof years later it secured.\r\n\r\nNo better excuse can be urged for England than that her hands were\r\nconstantly full at this period. When there was not actual war there were\r\nalways rumours of war. Fortunately for our country, in its greatest need\r\nits greatest hero’s star was in the ascendant. How often in these pages\r\nmust we recur again and again to the name of Nelson? The year after\r\nAmerica had declared her independence, he was, it is true, but simply a\r\nlieutenant, and scarcely over nineteen years of age. He had already seen\r\nsome service. He had been to the West Indies and to the Arctic Ocean,\r\nwhere, on Captain Phipps’ expedition, occurred one of those little\r\nincidents which indicated a hero in embryo. Young Nelson was one day\r\nmissing, and though every search was instantly made for him, it seemed\r\nentirely in vain, and all imagined he was lost. Somebody at length\r\ndiscovered him at a considerable distance off, on the ice, armed with a\r\nsingle musket, and fighting away with some object which, on nearer\r\napproach, proved to be an immense bear. Always slight in frame, and\r\ncomparatively feeble in body, what was the youngster about? It was found\r\nthat the lock of his musket proving useless, he had pursued the animal\r\nwith the hope of tiring him, and then intended to knock him on the head.\r\nOn his return he was reprimanded for leaving the ship without permission,\r\nand asked why he had been so rash. The young hero replied, “I wished, sir,\r\nto get the skin for my father;” and although there is no record of the\r\nfact, it may well be believed that his little escapade was not very\r\nseverely punished. Almost immediately after his return from the frozen\r\nregions, we find him in the East Indies, where his health nearly gave way.\r\nFor the second time in Nelson’s career we find him almost abandoning the\r\nsea. “I felt impressed,” wrote he long afterwards, “with an idea that I\r\nshould never rise in my profession. My mind was staggered with a view of\r\nthe difficulties which I had to surmount, and the little interest I\r\npossessed. I could discover no means of reaching the object of my\r\nambition. After a long and gloomy reverie, in which I almost wished myself\r\noverboard, a sudden glow of patriotism was kindled within me, and hope\r\npresented my king and country as my patrons. ‘Well then,’ I exclaimed, ‘I\r\nwill be a hero, and confiding in Providence, I will brave every danger.’”\r\nFrom that moment his aspirations became inspirations, and he believed\r\nfully that\r\n\r\n  “The light which led him on,\r\n  Was light from Heaven.”\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: NELSON AND THE BEAR.]\r\n\r\nThe young sailor, or he who may become one, may learn very much from the\r\nearlier part of Nelson’s career. Again and again was he disappointed, and\r\nalthough momentarily irritable, he always ended by looking forward to the\r\ninevitable reward due to the man who places country and duty above all\r\nother considerations. After his services at Bastia and Calvi, where he\r\nlost that eye which afterwards served him so well from its blindness, his\r\nbravery was altogether overlooked in the despatches. “One hundred and ten\r\ndays,” said he, “I have been actually engaged at sea and on shore against\r\nthe enemy; three actions against ships, two against Bastia in my own ship,\r\nfour boat actions, two villages taken, and twelve sail of vessels burnt. I\r\ndo not know that any one has done more; I have had the comfort to be\r\nalways applauded by my commanders-in-chief, but never to be rewarded; and,\r\nwhat is more mortifying, for services in which I have been wounded, others\r\nhave been praised who, at the time, were actually in bed, far from the\r\nscene of action. They have not done me justice; but never mind—I’ll have a\r\ngazette of my own!”\r\n\r\nAnd what a gazette it was! When, in 1797, Nelson received a special grant\r\nfor his services, a memorial had to be drawn up, when it was found that he\r\nhad been engaged against the enemy upwards of _one hundred and twenty\r\ntimes_! During the latest war up to the above date he had assisted at the\r\ncapture of seven sail of the line, six frigates, four corvettes, and\r\neleven privateers; he had taken or destroyed nearly fifty sail of merchant\r\nvessels.\r\n\r\nThen followed the great battle of the Nile. The French fleet having been\r\ndiscovered by Captain Samuel Flood, the action commenced at sunset. The\r\nshores of the Bay of Aboukir were lined with spectators, who beheld the\r\napproach of the English and the terrible conflict which ensued, in silent\r\nand awe-stricken astonishment. A brisk fire was opened by the _Vanguard_,\r\nwhich ship covered the approach of those in the rear; in a few minutes\r\nevery man stationed at the first six guns in her fore part were all down,\r\nkilled or wounded. Admiral Nelson was so entirely resolved to conquer, or\r\nto perish in the attempt, that he led into action with six ensigns, red,\r\nwhite, and blue—he could not bear the idea of his colours being carried\r\naway by a random shot from the enemy.\r\n\r\nNelson—long minus one eye and one arm—in this battle received a severe\r\nwound in his head, the skin of the forehead hanging down over his face.\r\nCaptain Berry, who was standing near, caught him in his arms. It was the\r\nopinion of everyone, including the sufferer, that he was shot through the\r\nhead. On being carried down in the cockpit, where several of his gallant\r\ncrew were stretched with shattered limbs and mangled wounds, the surgeon\r\nimmediately came with great anxiety to the admiral. “No,” replied the\r\nhero, “I will take my turn with my brave fellows!” The agony of his wound\r\nincreasing, he became convinced that he was dying, and sent for the\r\nchaplain, begging him to remember him to Lady Nelson; he even went so far\r\nas to appoint Hardy post-captain for the _Vanguard_. When the surgeon came\r\nto examine and dress the wound, it clearly appeared that it was not\r\nmortal, and the joyful intelligence spread quickly through the ship. As\r\nsoon as the operation was over, Nelson sat down, and that very night wrote\r\nthe celebrated official letter which appeared in the _Gazette_. He came on\r\ndeck just in time to witness the conflagration of _L’Orient_. So terrible\r\nwas the carnage at the battle of the Nile that the Bay of Aboukir was\r\ncovered for a week with the floating corpses, and though men were\r\ncontinually employed to sink them, many of the bodies, having slipped from\r\nthe shot, would re-appear on the surface. Alas! the accounts of these\r\nhorrible scenes, painful as they are, yet pale before the latest horror in\r\nour own Thames—the loss of the _Princess Alice_, where more perished than\r\nin many a recorded sea-fight of days gone by.\r\n\r\nAfter the battle, the officers vied with each other in sending various\r\npresents to the admiral, to show their delight that he had, though\r\nseverely wounded, escaped death. Captain Hallowell, who had long been on\r\nthe most intimate terms with Nelson, hit on the extraordinary idea of\r\nhaving an elegantly-furnished coffin constructed by his carpenter from the\r\nwreck of _L’Orient_, a grim present, which he ordered to be made for the\r\nadmiral. It was conveyed on board, and it is stated that Nelson highly\r\nappreciated the present of his brave officer. Nelson kept it for some\r\nmonths upright in his cabin, till at length an old servant tearfully\r\nentreating him, he allowed it to be carried below. Nelson was now at the\r\nheight of glory; never had before, or has since, any admiral received\r\nhonours from so many various nations and crowned heads. The following is a\r\nlist of presents bestowed on him for his services in the Mediterranean\r\nbetween October, 1798, and October, 1799:—\r\n\r\n      From his king and country, a peerage of Great Britain and gold\r\n      medal.\r\n      From Parliament, for his own life and two next heirs, per annum,\r\n      £2,000.\r\n      From the Parliament of Ireland, per annum, £1,000.\r\n      From the East India Company, £10,000.\r\n      From the Turkey Company, a piece of plate of great value; from the\r\n      City of London, a magnificent sword.\r\n      From the Grand Signor, a diamond aigrette and rich pelisse, valued\r\n      at £3,000.\r\n      From the Grand Signor’s mother, a rose set with diamonds, valued at\r\n      £1,000.\r\n      From the Emperor of Russia, a box set with diamonds, valued at\r\n      £2,500.\r\n      From the King of the Two Sicilies, a sword richly ornamented with\r\n      diamonds, valued at £5,000.\r\n      From the King of Sardinia, a box set with diamonds, valued at\r\n      £1,200.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, all accompanied by complimentary addresses or\r\nletters, he received presents from the Island of Zante, the city of\r\nPalermo, and private individuals. Had he not attained a “_Gazette_ of his\r\nown?”\r\n\r\n                       [Illustration: LORD NELSON.]\r\n\r\nThe battle of Copenhagen made Nelson’s talents, in some respects, even\r\nmore conspicuous. The Danes were admirably prepared for defence. Upwards\r\nof a hundred pieces of cannon were mounted on the Crown Batteries at the\r\nentrance of the harbour, while a line of twenty-five two-deckers,\r\nfrigates, and floating batteries were moored across its mouth. A Dane who\r\ncame on board during the ineffectual negotiations which preceded\r\nhostilities, having occasion to express his proposals in writing, found\r\nthe pen thick and blunt, and holding it up, sarcastically said, “If your\r\nguns are not better pointed than your pens, you will make little\r\nimpression on Copenhagen.” Nelson himself said that of all the engagements\r\nin which he had borne a part, this was the most terrible. He had with him\r\ntwelve ships of the line, besides frigates and smaller craft, the\r\nremainder of the fleet being with Sir Hyde Parker, the Commander-in-chief,\r\nfour miles off. Three of his squadron grounded, and, owing to the fears of\r\nthe masters and pilots, the anchors were let go nearly a cable’s length\r\nfrom the enemy, whereas, had they proceeded a little further, they would\r\nhave reached deeper water, and the victory would have been effected in\r\nhalf the time. The fight, which commenced at ten o’clock in the morning,\r\nwas by no means decided at one in the afternoon, when Sir Hyde Parker\r\nsignalled for the action to cease. It was reported to Nelson, who took no\r\nnotice of it. The signal-lieutenant meeting him at the next turn, asked\r\nhim if he should repeat it. “No,” answered Nelson, “acknowledge it.”\r\nShortly afterwards he called after him to know if the signal for close\r\naction was still hoisted, and being answered in the affirmative, said,\r\n“Mind you keep it so.” He now rapidly paced the deck, moving the stump of\r\nhis right arm in a manner which always denoted great agitation; for the\r\nCommander-in-chief still signalled “leave off action.” At last, turning to\r\nthe captain, he said, “You know, Foley, I’ve only one eye, and I have a\r\nright to be blind sometimes,” and he ordered his signal for closer battle\r\nto be nailed to the mast. Admiral Graves disobeyed the Commander-in-chief\r\nin similar manner, but the squadron of frigates moved off. About two\r\no’clock great part of the Danish line had ceased to fire, some of their\r\nlighter ships were adrift, and some had struck. It was, however, difficult\r\nto take possession of them, as they were protected by the batteries of an\r\nisland, and they themselves fired on the English boats as they approached.\r\nThis irritated Nelson: “We must either,” he said, “send on shore and stop\r\nthese irregular proceedings, or send in fire-ships and burn the prizes.”\r\nIn this part of the battle the victory was complete, but the three ships\r\nahead were still engaged, and considerably exposed. Nelson, with his usual\r\npresence of mind, seized the occasion to open a negotiation, and wrote to\r\nthe Crown Prince as follows: “Vice-Admiral Lord Nelson has directions to\r\nspare Denmark when she no longer resists. The line of defence which\r\ncovered her shores has struck to the British flag; but if the firing is\r\ncontinued on the part of Denmark, he must be obliged to set on fire all\r\nthe prizes that he has taken, without having the power of saving the brave\r\nDanes who have defended them.” Captain Frederick Thesiger was sent in with\r\nit. During his absence the remainder of the enemy’s line eastward was\r\nsilenced; the Crown Batteries continued to fire, till the Danish General\r\nLindholm returned with a flag of truce, when the action closed. His\r\nmessage from the prince was to inquire what was the object of Nelson’s\r\nnote? Nelson replied that “it was humanity; he consented that the wounded\r\nDanes should be taken on shore, and that he on his part would take his\r\nprisoners out of the vessels and burn or carry off his prizes as he\r\nthought fit. He presented his humblest duty to the prince, saying that he\r\nshould consider this the greatest victory he ever gained if it might be\r\nthe cause of a happy reconciliation between the two countries.” This\r\nproposal was accepted in the course of the evening, and a suspension of\r\nhostilities for twenty-four hours agreed upon, during which it was\r\nresolved that Nelson should land and negotiate in person with the prince.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: NELSON AT COPENHAGEN.]\r\n\r\nAccordingly next morning he landed, being protected by a strong guard from\r\nthe possible vengeance of the Danish population. “The battle so dreadfully\r\ndestructive to the Danes was in sight of the city; the whole of the\r\nsucceeding day was employed in landing the wounded, and there was scarcely\r\na house without its cause for mourning. It was no new thing for Nelson to\r\nshow himself regardless of danger, and it is to the honour of Denmark that\r\nthe populace suffered themselves to be restrained. Some difficulty\r\noccurred in adjusting the duration of the armistice. He required sixteen\r\nweeks, giving, like a seaman, the true reason, that he might have time to\r\nact against the Russian fleet and return. This not being acceded to, a\r\nhint was thrown out by one of the Danish commissioners of the renewal of\r\nhostilities. ‘Renew hostilities!’ said he to the interpreter, ‘tell him we\r\nare ready at a moment; ready to bombard this very night!’ Fourteen weeks\r\nwere at length agreed upon; the death of the Emperor Paul intervened, and\r\nthe Northern Confederacy was destroyed. Nelson was raised to the rank of\r\nviscount, and, indeed, had not the Government dealt out honours to him\r\nslowly and by degrees, their stock would long ere that have been\r\nexhausted.” The grand sea battle in which he saved his country and lost\r\nhis life has been already described in these pages.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE HISTORY OF SHIPS AND SHIPPING INTERESTS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n       Early Paddle-boats—Worked by Animal Power—Blasco de Garay’s\r\n     Experiment—Solomon de Caus—David Ramsey’s Engines—The Marquis of\r\n        Worcester—A Horse-boat—Boats worked by Water—By Springs—By\r\n    Gunpowder—Patrick Miller’s Triple Vessel—Double Vessels worked by\r\n     Capstans—The First Practical Steam-boat—Symington’s Engines—The\r\n     Second Steamer—The _Charlotte Dundas_—American Enterprise—James\r\n         Rumsey’s Oar-boats worked by Steam—Poor Fitch—Before his\r\n      Age—Robert Fulton—His Torpedo Experiments—Wonderful Submarine\r\n    Boat—Experiments at Brest and Deal—His first Steam-boat—Breaks in\r\n            Pieces—Trip of the _Clermont_, the first American\r\n    Steamer—Opposition to his Vessels—A Pendulum-boat—The first Steam\r\n                      War-ship—Henry Bell’s _Comet_.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe employment of animal power in the propulsion of vessels is of very\r\nancient date, and we shall see that steam-power was proposed for the same\r\npurpose as soon as the steam-engine had been utilised for pumping mines,\r\nalthough it was some time before it could be applied practically and\r\nprofitably. We are told that “in some very ancient manuscripts extant in\r\nthe King of France’s library, it is said that the boats by which the Roman\r\narmy under Claudius Caudex was transported into Sicily, were propelled by\r\nwheels moved by oxen. And in many old military treatises the substitution\r\nof wheels for oars is mentioned.”(20) “Although an old work on China,”\r\nsays another authority,(21) “contains a sketch of a vessel moved by four\r\npaddle-wheels, and used perhaps in the seventh century, the earliest\r\ndistinct notice of this means of propulsion appears to be by Robertus\r\nVulturius, in A.D. 1472, who gives several wood-cuts representing\r\npaddle-wheels.”\r\n\r\nThe first use of steam in connection with the propulsion of vessels is\r\nperhaps that said to have been made by Blasco de Garay, in 1543. He had\r\nproposed to the Emperor Charles V. the construction of an engine capable\r\nof moving large vessels in a calm, and without the use of sails or oars.\r\n“In spite of the opposition this project encountered, the emperor\r\nconsented to witness the experiment, which was accordingly made in the\r\n_Trinity_, a vessel of 200 tons, laden with corn, in the port of\r\nBarcelona, on the 17th June, 1543. Garay, however, would not uncover his\r\nmachinery, or exhibit it publicly, but it was evident that it consisted of\r\na cauldron of boiling water (_una gran caldera de aqua hirviendo_), and of\r\ntwo wheels set in motion by that means, and applied externally on each\r\nside (_banda_) of the vessel.\r\n\r\n“The persons commissioned by the emperor to report on the invention seem\r\nto have approved it, commending especially the readiness with which the\r\nvessel tacked. The Treasurer Ravago, however, observed that a ship with\r\nthe proposed machinery could not go faster than two leagues in three\r\nhours; that the apparatus was complex and expensive; and that there was\r\ndanger of the boiler bursting. The other commissioners maintained that\r\nsuch a vessel might go at the rate of a league an hour, and would tack in\r\nhalf the time required by an ordinary ship. When the exhibition was over,\r\nGaray removed the apparatus from the _Trinity_, depositing the woodwork in\r\nthe arsenal at Barcelona, but retaining himself the rest of the machinery.\r\nNotwithstanding, however, the objections urged by Ravago, the emperor was\r\ninclined to favour his project, but his attention at the time was\r\nengrossed by other matters. Garay was, however, promoted, and received a\r\nsum of money, besides the expenses of the experiment made at Barcelona.”\r\nThe above account is from Spanish sources, supposed to be authentic, till\r\nMr. MacGregor, in 1857, made a journey into Spain for the express purpose\r\nof verifying them. The conclusions to which he came were that the\r\npaddle-wheels were turned by men.\r\n\r\nAbout this epoch, however, frequent mention is made of means of propulsion\r\nother than by sails or oars, and it is evident that men of learning in\r\nvarious places were nearly simultaneously musing and thinking over the\r\nmatter. J. C. Scaliger (who died 1558) published at Frankfort a short\r\naccount of a vessel to be propelled without oars. Another inventor(22) a\r\nfew years later, says quaintly, “And furthermore you may make a boat to\r\ngoe without oares or sayle, by the placing of certain wheeles on the\r\noutside of the boate, in that sort, that the armes of the wheeles may goe\r\ninto the water, and so turning the wheeles by some provision, and so the\r\nwheeles shall make the boate goe.” Bessoni, in 1582, describes a vessel\r\nconsisting of two hulls decked above,—like the _Castalia_ or\r\n_Calais-Douvres_—and a wheel worked by ropes and a windlass in the\r\ninterval between them. Ramelli, in 1588, designed a paddle-wheel\r\nflat-bottomed boat, worked by men turning a winch-handle. Indeed, Roger\r\nBacon had, three centuries and a half before, spoken of a “vessel which,\r\nbeing almost wholly submerged, would run through the water against waves\r\nand winds with a speed greater than that attained by the fastest London\r\npinnaces.”\r\n\r\nThe power of steam was rapidly becoming understood. In 1601, Baptista\r\nPorta (the inventor of the magic-lantern) made many experiments on steam\r\nand its condensation, and its relative bulk to water. Rivault shortly\r\nafter describes the power of steam in bursting a strong bomb-shell, partly\r\nfilled by water, tightly plugged, and then heated. In 1615, we find\r\nSolomon de Caus proving that “water will mount by the help of fire higher\r\nthan its level;” and Branca, in 1629, applying steam to the vanes of a\r\nwheel to make it revolve, as in some toys to-day. In our own country we\r\nfind David Ramsey, one of the Pages of the King’s Bedchamber, obtaining,\r\nwith a partner, a patent in 1618, “To exercise and put in use _divers newe\r\napt formes or kinds of Engines_, and other pfitable Invenc’ons, as well to\r\nplough grounds without horse or oxen, and to make fertile as well as\r\nbarren peats, salts and sea lands, as inland and upland grounds within the\r\nRealmes of England, &c. As, also, to raise waters, _and to make boats for\r\ncarriages runnin upon the water as swift in calmes, and more safe in\r\nstorms, than boats fall sayled in great windes_.” Twelve years later we\r\nfind Ramsey applying alone for a patent of most comprehensive character.\r\nIt was designed “_To raise water from lowe pitts by fire_ [the\r\nsteam-engine]. To make any sort of Milles to go on standing Waters by\r\ncontinual moc’on without the helpe of Windes, Weight, or Horse. To make\r\nall sortes of Tapestry without any weaving loome or way even yet in use in\r\nthis kingdom. _To make Boats, Ships, and Barges to goe against the Wind\r\nand Tyde, &c._” And so on through the century. Woodcroft, in his standard\r\nwork,(23) enumerates over a dozen more patents having for their object the\r\npropulsion of boats and vessels, which were granted before 1700, including\r\none to the celebrated Marquis of Worcester, which, however, did not\r\ncontemplate the use of steam. In the “Century of Invencions” Lord\r\nWorcester says: “By it, I can make a vessel, of as great burden as the\r\nriver can bear, to go against stream, _which the more rapid it is, the\r\nfaster it shall advance_, and the moveable part that works it, may be by\r\none man still guided to take advantage of the stream, and yet to steer the\r\nboat to any point; and this engine is applicable to any vessel or boat\r\nwhatsoever, without being, therefore, made on purpose, and worketh these\r\neffects:—_it roweth, it draweth, it driveth_, (if needs be) to pass London\r\nBridge against the stream at low water; and a _boat laying at anchor, the\r\nengine may be used for loading or unloading_.” Woodcroft explains this as\r\nfollows: “It is obvious that the Marquis did not, by this, mean a\r\nsteam-propelled paddle-wheel boat, the action of which would not have been\r\nsuch as he describes; but a rope fastened at one end up the stream, and at\r\nthe other to the axis of water-wheels laying across the boat, and dipping\r\ninto the water, so as to be turned by the wheels, would fulfil the\r\nconditions proposed of advancing the boat faster, the more rapid the\r\nstream; and when at anchor such wheels might have been applied to the\r\nother purposes.” Floating mills, worked by large water-wheels, may be seen\r\non the Rhine to-day.\r\n\r\nPapin, the French philosopher, while in England, witnessed an experiment\r\non the Thames, in which a boat, fitted with revolving oars or paddles, was\r\nworked from a kind of treadmill turned round by horses. “The velocity with\r\nwhich this horse-boat was impelled was so great, that it left the king’s\r\nbarge, manned with sixteen rowers, far astern in the race of trial.” In\r\n1682, a horse tow vessel was used at Chatham. It was “constructed with a\r\nwheel on each side of the vessel, connected by an axle going across the\r\nboat, and the paddles were made to revolve by horses moving a wheel turned\r\nby a trundle fixed on the axle. It drew but four and a half feet of water,\r\nand towed the greatest ships by the help of four, six, or eight horses.”\r\n\r\nIn 1729, Dr. John Allen obtained a patent for his new invention, one which\r\nhas been revived with some success in later days. It was to propel a\r\nvessel by forcing water through the stern, at a convenient distance under\r\nthe surface of the water, into the sea, by suitable engines on board.\r\n“Amongst,” says the doctor, “the several and various engines I have\r\ninvented for this purpose, is one of a very extraordinary nature, whose\r\noperation is owing to the explosion of _gunpowder_, I having found out a\r\nmethod of firing gunpowder in vacuo, or in a confined space, whereby I can\r\napply the whole force of it, which is inconceivably great, so as to\r\ncommunicate motion to a great variety of engines, which may also be\r\napplied in working mines and other purposes.” And again, in 1760, a Swiss\r\nclergyman published a pamphlet in London, in which oars worked with\r\nsprings were to be used, and the expansive power of gunpowder was to be\r\nused to bend the springs. He states, candidly enough, that since he\r\narrived in England he had learned that thirty years before a Scotchman had\r\nproposed to make a ship proceed by means of gunpowder, but that thirty\r\nbarrels had scarcely forwarded it ten miles. We may smile at these\r\nattempted uses of gunpowder, but they were doubtless suggested by the\r\nscientific studies of the day, which were particularly directed to the\r\nexpansive power of vaporised water. In our own day, steam has been\r\nsubstituted for powder in discharging a cannon. Perkins’ “steam-gun” was\r\nlong one of the curiosities of the Polytechnic Institution.\r\n\r\nOn the 5th of January, 1769, James Watt obtained a patent for a series of\r\nimprovements in the steam-engine, one of which was most important in its\r\nbearing on naval engines. It was that which provided for steam acting\r\n_above_ the piston as well as below it, in, of course, the same cylinder.\r\nHere was a grand move at once. Previously every engine for pumping, the\r\nonly practical purpose to which steam was yet put, was worked by a beam\r\nengine and pair of cylinders. In 1779, Matthew Wasborough, an engineer of\r\nBristol, obtained a patent, as others, indeed, had before him, for\r\nconverting a rectilinear into a continuous circular motion. It failed, as\r\nthe others had done, because they required ratchet wheels, pulleys, &c.\r\nThe following year James Pickard invented the present connecting-rod and\r\ncrank, with fly-wheel, and removed the great obstacle to propelling\r\nvessels by steam. The following year, again, Watt invented what is now\r\nknown as the “sun and planet motion,” another step in the same direction.\r\n\r\nWe now approach the name of one of those who are most intimately connected\r\nwith the history of steam navigation, Patrick Miller of Dalswinton. In\r\n1787 he published a pamphlet(24) describing a _triple vessel_, propelled\r\nby paddle-wheels, and worked by cranks. In it he very distinctly says: “I\r\nhave also reason to believe that the power of the _steam-engine_ may be\r\napplied to work the _wheels_, so as to give them a quicker motion, and\r\nconsequently to increase that of the ship. In the course of this summer I\r\nintend to make the experiment,” &c. A statement was presented to the Royal\r\nSociety, Dec. 20th, 1787, regarding experiments made by Mr. Miller in the\r\nFirth of Forth, the previous summer, in a _double_ vessel, sixty feet long\r\nand fourteen and a half feet broad, put in motion by a water-wheel,\r\nwrought by a capstan of five bars. On the lower part of the capstan a\r\nwheel was fixed, with teeth pointing upwards, to work in a trundle fixed\r\non the axis of the water-wheel. She was worked at from three and a half to\r\nfive miles an hour, with four or five men at the capstan. Two men\r\npropelled her at the rate of two and a half miles.\r\n\r\nThe vessel was three-masted, and sailed well with a smart breeze, when the\r\nwheel was invariably raised above the surface of the water. “After making\r\nsundry tacks in the Firth,” says the narrator, “with all the sails set,\r\nthe wind fell to a gentle breeze, when all the sails were taken in, and\r\nthe following experiments made:—\r\n\r\n“The vessel being put in motion by the water-wheel, wrought by five men at\r\nthe capstern (_sic_) was steered so as to keep the wind right ahead, and\r\nher going was found by the log to be three and a half miles in the hour.\r\n\r\n“After this the wind was brought on the beam (that situation being\r\nconsidered as the nearest to trying the effect of the wheel in a calm),\r\nwhen five men at the capstern made the vessel to go at the rate of four\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\n“With the wind brought on the quarter, five men caused her to go at the\r\nrate of four and a half miles an hour,” &c.\r\n\r\nAnd so it goes on. Miller made some very distinct statements as to the\r\ndistance the different vessels should be placed from each other, and\r\nfurther states that the objection that the sea would separate the\r\ndifferent bottoms is not well founded, “top weight not being detrimental\r\nto these ships in point of stiffness, all the beams on the different decks\r\nmay be of the same size; and the strength of these united must be very\r\nsuperior to any weight or force which can operate against it when the ship\r\nis afloat, however agitated or high the sea may be.” These early\r\nexperiments are particularly interesting now, when the _Calais-Douvres_, a\r\nvessel which must be described hereafter, has proved a success.\r\n\r\nMr. James Taylor may also be considered as one of the authors or inventors\r\nof the present system of steam navigation. In a memorial laid before a\r\nSelect Committee of the House of Commons in 1824, he says:—\r\n\r\n“Before, however, entering upon the main object, permit me to introduce it\r\nby a short statement explanatory of my connection with Mr. Miller. In the\r\nautumn of 1785, I went to live in Mr. Miller’s house as preceptor to his\r\ntwo younger sons. I found him a gentleman of great patriotism, generosity,\r\nand philanthropy, and at the same time of a very speculative turn of mind.\r\nBefore I knew him he had gone through a very long and expensive course of\r\nexperiments upon artillery, of which the carronade was the result. When I\r\ncame to know him he was engaged in experiments upon shipping, and had\r\nbuilt several (ships or vessels) upon different constructions, and of\r\nvarious magnitudes. The double vessel seemed to fix his attention most. In\r\nthe summer of 1786 I attended him repeatedly in his experiments at Leith,\r\nwhich I then viewed as parties of pleasure and amusement. But in the\r\nspring of 1787 a circumstance occurred which gave me a different opinion.\r\nMr. Miller had engaged in a sailing match with some gentlemen at Leith,\r\nagainst a Custom House boat (a wherry), which was reckoned a first-rate\r\nsailer. A day was appointed, and I attended Mr. Miller. His was a double\r\nvessel, sixty feet deck, propelled by two wheels, turned by two men each.\r\n* * * Being then young and stout, I took my share of the labours of the\r\nwheels, which I found very severe exercise, but it satisfied me that a\r\nproper power only was wanting to produce much utility from the invention.”\r\nThis led to long and interesting discussions on the subject, and Miller\r\nexplained that his principal object was to enable vessels to avoid or\r\nextricate themselves from dangerous situations, and also give them powers\r\nof motion during calms. He asked Mr. Taylor to give him the benefit of his\r\nbrains. At last the latter told him that he could suggest no power equal\r\nto the steam-engine. The question then became how to apply it. Taylor made\r\nsketches according to his ideas, and Mr. Miller then said, “Well, when we\r\ngo to Edinburgh we will apply to an operative engineer, and take an\r\nestimate for a small engine, and if it is not a large sum, we will set\r\nabout it; but as I am a stranger to the steam-engine, you shall take\r\ncharge of that part of the business, and we will try what we can make of\r\nit.”\r\n\r\n“At this time William Symington, a young man employed at the lead mines at\r\nWanlockhead, had invented a new construction of the steam-engine, by\r\nthrowing off the air-pump. I had seen a model work, and was pleased with\r\nit, and thought it very answerable for Mr. Miller’s purpose. Symington had\r\ncome into Edinburgh that winter for education. Being acquainted with him,\r\nI informed him of Mr. Miller’s intentions and mine, and asked if he could\r\nundertake to apply his engine to Mr. Miller’s vessels, and if he could I\r\nwould recommend him. He answered in the affirmative, and from friendship I\r\nrecommended both himself and engine, and afterwards introduced him to Mr.\r\nMiller. After some conversation, Symington engaged to perform the work,\r\nand Mr. Miller agreed to employ him. It was finally arranged that the\r\nexperiment should be performed on the lake at Dalswinton, in the ensuing\r\nsummer (1788). Accordingly in the spring, after the classes of the College\r\nbroke up, I remained in town to superintend the castings, &c., which were\r\ndone in brass, by George Watt, founder, back of Shakspear Square. When\r\nthey were finished I sent the articles to the country, and followed\r\nmyself. After some interval I took Symington with me to Dalswinton to put\r\nthe parts together. This was accomplished about the beginning of October,\r\nand the engine, mounted in a frame, was placed upon the deck of a very\r\nhandsome double pleasure-boat, upon the lake. We then proceeded to action,\r\nand a more complete, successful, and beautiful experiment was never made\r\nby any man at any time, either in art or science. The vessel moved\r\ndelightfully, and notwithstanding the smallness of the cylinders (four\r\ninches diameter), at the rate of five miles an hour. After amusing\r\nourselves a few days, the engine was removed, and carried into the house,\r\nwhere it remained as a piece of ornamental furniture for a number of\r\nyears.” The vessel was 25 feet long and 7 broad. Thus was steam navigation\r\ninaugurated! How few of the readers of the _Dumfries Newspaper_, the\r\n_Edinburgh Advertiser_, or the _Scots’ Magazine_, when reading the brief\r\naccount printed in their columns, dreamt of the revolution which this\r\ninteresting and successful little experiment involved. The latter could\r\nnot see farther than its utility in canals, and other inland navigation.\r\nThe _Annual Register_ for the year does not even mention it.\r\n\r\nIt was now agreed to repeat the experiment. A double engine with\r\neighteen-inch cylinder was constructed at Carron under Symington’s\r\ndirections. In November, 1789, she was tried on the Forth and Clyde Canal.\r\n“After passing Lock 16,” says Taylor, “we proceeded cautiously and\r\npleasantly for some time, but after giving the engine full play the arms\r\nof the wheels, which had been constructed too slight, began to give way,\r\nand one float after another broke off, till we were satisfied no accuracy\r\ncould be attained in the experiment until the wheels were replaced by new\r\nones of a stronger construction. This was done with all possible speed,\r\nand upon the 26th December, we again proceeded to action. This day we\r\nmoved freely without accident, and were much gratified to find our motion\r\nnearly seven miles per hour. Next day we repeated the experiment with the\r\nsame success and pleasure. Satisfied now that everything proposed was\r\naccomplished, it was unnecessary to dwell longer upon the business; for,\r\nindeed, both this and the experiment of last year were as complete as any\r\nperformance made by steam-boats, even to the present day.” Mr. Miller, who\r\npaid all the expenses of these steam experiments, did not pursue them\r\nfurther, and it is to be regretted, inasmuch as his name has not been so\r\npopularly associated with the infancy of steam navigation as could be\r\nwished. He was an enthusiast in many branches of practical science, and\r\nseems latterly to have given his mind more particularly to improvements in\r\nagriculture. Mr. Taylor’s connection with steam-boat experiments ceased\r\nwith those of the second boat in 1789. “And it is clear,” says Woodcroft,\r\n“from his own statement and those of his friends, that he was neither the\r\ninventor of the machinery by which either of those boats was driven, nor\r\nof the mode of connecting the engines to the boat and wheels.” His widow\r\nreceived a small pension from Government, and in 1837 each of his four\r\ndaughters received a gift of £50 for their father’s connection with the\r\nexperiments. Miller sought no pecuniary aid or reward of any kind; and,\r\nalthough he devoted his time and talents, and expended nearly £30,000 of\r\nhis own fortune in the improvement of artillery and naval architecture,\r\nhis services were wholly overlooked by the powers that were. Mr. Woodcroft\r\nhas very clearly shown that Miller, in spite of the apparent success of\r\nthe experiments, had not great faith in Symington’s machinery, which he\r\ndescribes in a letter “as the most improper of all steam-engines for\r\ngiving motion to a vessel.” We find him much later describing, in a patent\r\nspecification, a new form of flat boat, with centre-boards and\r\npaddle-wheels, still worked by his favourite capstans.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: THE “CHARLOTTE DUNDAS.”]\r\n\r\nMore than ten years elapsed before Symington, the builder of Miller’s\r\nengines, found another patron. In 1801, Thomas, first Lord Dundas,\r\nemployed him to fit up a steam-boat for the Forth and Clyde Canal Company,\r\nin which he was a large shareholder. “Having,” says Lindsay,(25) “availed\r\nhimself of the many improvements made by Watt and others, Symington\r\npatented his new engine on the 14th of March of that year, and fitting it\r\non board the _Charlotte Dundas_, named after his lordship’s daughter,\r\nproduced, in the opinion of most writers who have carefully and\r\nimpartially inquired into this interesting subject, ‘the first _practical\r\nsteam-boat_.’” In March, 1802, the _Charlotte Dundas_ made her trial trip\r\non the canal. It was in one sense a fortunate day for the experiment, for\r\na gale of wind blew, and no other vessel attempted to move to windward.\r\nThe little steamer, towing two barges of seventy tons burden, accomplished\r\nthe trip to Port Dundas, Glasgow, a distance of 19½ miles, in six hours,\r\nor at the rate of 3¼ miles per hour. Lord Dundas, who was on board,\r\nthought favourably of the experiment, and in a letter of introduction to\r\nthe Duke of Bridgewater, recommended Symington’s new engine to his notice.\r\nHis grace almost immediately gave him an order to construct eight vessels\r\nsimilar to the _Charlotte Dundas_, and the struggling engineer naturally\r\nthought that his fortune was made. Alas! before the arrangements could be\r\nconsummated the duke died, and the committee who had charge of the canal\r\nafter his decease, came to the conclusion that the wash from steam-boats\r\nwould injure its banks. Woodcroft considers that “this vessel might, from\r\nthe simplicity of its machinery, have been at work to this day with such\r\nordinary repairs as are now occasionally required for all steam-boats,”\r\nand claims that to Symington belonged “the undoubted merit of having\r\ncombined for the first time those improvements which constitute the\r\n_present system of steam navigation_.” The success of the engine consisted\r\nin this: that, “after placing in a boat a double-acting reciprocating\r\nengine, he _attached his crank to the axis of the paddle-wheel_,” a\r\ncombination on which there has been no improvement to the present day, as\r\nrotatory motion is secured without the interposition of a lever or beam.\r\nSo much for the engine, but how about the poor engineer? This boat was\r\nlaid up in a creek of the canal, where she remained for many years exposed\r\nas a curiosity, and perhaps also as a warning to ambitious speculators.\r\nSymington’s means were nearly exhausted, and after having had to fight\r\nTaylor at law in regard to some of the minor inventions employed, we find\r\nhim in 1825 receiving the miserable gift of £100 from the Privy Purse, and\r\nlater, a further sum of £50. What a return for labours which so distinctly\r\nled to our present system of steam navigation!\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: SYMINGTON.]\r\n\r\nIn 1797, an experiment which took place in the neighbourhood of Liverpool\r\nis recorded in the _Monthly Magazine_, on oars worked by steam; the engine\r\nmade eighteen strokes per minute, and propelled a vessel, heavily laden\r\nwith copper slag, through the Sankey Canal. The claims of other countries\r\nhave also been put forth, but the first attempts at _practical_ steam\r\nnavigation belong to Scotland, and, as we shall see, were improved to such\r\nan extent in America, that to that country belongs the credit of having\r\nfirst organised a steam-boat line for continuous and paying traffic.\r\n\r\nThe Americans had at an early period turned their attention to new modes\r\nof propelling vessels. As early as 1784, James Rumsey proposed to General\r\nWashington a project of steam navigation, but having been refused a patent\r\nin Pennsylvania, came to England, and succeeded in inducing a wealthy\r\ncountryman of his own, then in London, and others to disburse the expenses\r\nof an experiment, for which he afterwards obtained a patent. In this also\r\noars were worked by steam. A couple of years later, Fitch obtained from\r\nthe States of Pennsylvania and New York the exclusive right to run\r\nsteamers on their waters, and is said to have attained with one of his\r\nvessels the rate of four or five miles an hour against the current of the\r\nPotomac. In 1787 he built another vessel, 12 feet beam and 45 feet long,\r\nwith a 12-inch cylinder, which progressed at the rate of seven miles an\r\nhour. In 1790 he completed another and larger boat, which was advertised\r\nand used for a time as a regular passenger boat on the Delaware. The oars\r\nor paddles were worked from the stern.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: OUTLINE OF FITCH’S FIRST BOAT.]\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: FITCH’S SECOND BOAT.]\r\n\r\nPoor Fitch! He, in common with many others of the day who did and did not\r\ngive their ideas to the world, was on the right track, but could not put\r\nthem into practical and practicable shape. He was really a man of\r\nremarkable genius. The son of a Connecticut farmer, he had been\r\napprenticed to a watch and clock maker, where doubtless he increased his\r\nknowledge of the mechanical arts. During the early part of the\r\nRevolutionary War, he was armourer to the State of New Jersey, and later,\r\nbecame a land surveyor. While acting in that capacity, the idea first\r\nsuggested itself to him, as it did almost simultaneously to Symington in\r\nScotland, of propelling carriages by steam, but he soon abandoned it on\r\naccount of the roughness of the American roads. After that he turned his\r\nattention almost exclusively to the propulsion of vessels by steam,\r\nvisiting England and France, but obtaining no pecuniary advantage from the\r\nexperiments he proposed or consummated. In a sketch of his life, which\r\nappeared a few years since,(26) the writer describes Fitch’s difficulties\r\nin raising the money to finish his second steam-boat: “In a letter to\r\nDavid Roltenhouse, when asking an advance of £50 to finish the boat, he\r\nsays, ‘This, sir, whether I bring it to perfection or not, will be the\r\nmode of crossing the Atlantic for packets and armed vessels.’ But\r\neverything failed, and the poor projector loitered about the city for some\r\nmonths, a despised, unfortunate, heart-broken man. ‘Often have I seen\r\nhim,’ said Thomas P. Cope, many years afterwards, ‘stalking about like a\r\ntroubled spectre, with downcast eyes and lowering countenance, his coarse\r\nsoiled linen peeping through the elbows of a tattered garment.’ Speaking\r\nof a visit he once paid to John Wilson, his boat-builder, and Peter Brown,\r\nhis blacksmith, in which, as usual, he held forth upon his hobby, Mr. Cope\r\nsays: ‘After indulging himself for some time in this never-failing topic\r\nof deep excitement, he concluded with these memorable words: “Well,\r\ngentlemen, although I shall not live to see the time, you will, when\r\nsteam-boats will be preferred to all other means of conveyance, and\r\nespecially for passengers; and they will be particularly useful in the\r\nnavigation of the river Mississippi.” He then retired, on which Brown,\r\nturning to Wilson, exclaimed, in a tone of deep sympathy, “Poor fellow!\r\nwhat a pity he is crazy!”’” Fitch, reduced to utter poverty and despair,\r\nthrew himself into the Alleghany in 1798, and thus terminated his\r\nchequered life.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of John Cox Stevens, of New York, were not particularly\r\nsuccessful, although made at an expense of some 20,000 dollars. His vessel\r\nwas a “stern-wheeler,” similar to those common enough on many American\r\nrivers to-day. But he deserves the credit, apparently, of having been the\r\nfirst to practically apply a tubular boiler to marine engines. His boiler,\r\nonly 2 feet long by 15 inches wide and 12 inches high, consisted of no\r\nless than 41 copper tubes, each an inch in diameter. While Fitch and\r\nStevens were experimenting, another American citizen, Oliver Evans, was\r\nendeavouring to mature a plan for using steam at a very high pressure, to\r\nbe employed in propelling road wagons, and in an account of his plans,\r\nwhich he published in 1786, he suggests a mode of propelling vessels by\r\nsteam. “He states,” says Lindsay, “that in 1785 he placed his engine, used\r\nto clean docks, in a boat upon wheels, the combined weight being equal to\r\n200 barrels of flour, which he transported down to the water, and when it\r\nwas launched he fixed a paddle-wheel to the stern, and drove it down the\r\nSchuylkill to Delaware, and up the Delaware to the city, ‘leaving all the\r\nvessels going up behind, one at least half-way, the wind being ahead.’” In\r\n1794 and 1797 one Samuel Morey, of Connecticut, is said to have built two\r\nsteamers, which were publicly exhibited and made passages, but which do\r\nnot appear to have been afterwards employed. It is to Robert Fulton, who\r\nall this time was working at naval applications of many kinds, that not\r\nmerely America, but the whole world owes the practical and continuous use\r\nof steam-vessels. He and his associates started the first paying line of\r\nsteam-boats.\r\n\r\nThe life of this remarkable man is little known in England, and not\r\ngenerally even in his own country. Pursuing then the plan which has guided\r\nthe writer throughout this work, he proposes to give it, for these very\r\nreasons, in fuller detail than has been usual with better known examples\r\nof patient and struggling inventors.\r\n\r\nRobert Fulton was born in the year 1765, in the village of Little Britain,\r\nPennsylvania, of respectable, but not wealthy, parents. From his earliest\r\nyears he showed a great aptitude for the study of the mechanical arts,\r\nand, indeed, for the fine arts also. So marked was his progress in drawing\r\nand painting, that he was recommended to go to England and study art\r\nseriously. This at length he did, and for several years we find him an\r\ninmate of Benjamin West’s house. Most readers will remember that West,\r\nalthough he spent the larger part of his life in England, and made his\r\ngreat successes there, was by birth American. Fulton afterwards lived in\r\nDevonshire and other parts of England, and practised art for a time, while\r\nhis brain was busy with schemes for improving inland navigation by the\r\nconstruction of canals, with new forms of bridges and aqueducts. Next we\r\nfind him in France living with the family of one of his countrymen, Joel\r\nBarlow; during this period he painted a panorama, which was a great\r\nsuccess. In 1797 he experimented with carcases of gunpowder—practically\r\ntorpedoes—under water, and was engaged in perfecting a wonderful submarine\r\nboat. The French and Dutch Governments gave him some little encouragement,\r\nso far as fair words were concerned, and he wasted a considerable amount\r\nof time in hanging about public offices, to be eventually disappointed,\r\nfor his plans were rejected.\r\n\r\nBut the French Government changed. Bonaparte placed himself at the head of\r\nit, with the title of First Consul. Mr. Fulton soon presented an address\r\nto him, soliciting him to patronise the project for submarine navigation,\r\nand praying him to appoint a commission with sufficient funds and powers\r\nto give the necessary assistance. This request was immediately granted,\r\nand the citizens Volney, La Place, and Monge were named the commissioners.\r\nIn the spring of the year 1801, Mr. Fulton repaired to Brest, to make\r\nexperiments with the plunging-boat he had constructed the previous winter.\r\nThis, so he says, had many imperfections, natural to a first machine of\r\nsuch complicated combinations; added to this, it had suffered much injury\r\nfrom rust in consequence of his having been obliged to use iron instead of\r\nbrass or copper for bolts and arbours. Notwithstanding these\r\ndisadvantages, he engaged in a course of experiments with the machine,\r\nwhich required no less courage than energy and perseverance. Of his\r\nproceedings he made a report to the committee appointed by the French\r\nexecutive, from which report we learn the following interesting facts:—\r\n\r\n“On the 3rd July, 1801, he embarked with three companions on board his\r\nplunging-boat in the harbour of Brest, and descended in it to the depth of\r\nfive, ten, fifteen, and so to twenty-five feet; but he did not attempt to\r\ngo lower, because he found that his imperfect machine would not bear the\r\npressure of a greater depth. He remained below the surface one hour.\r\nDuring this time they were in utter darkness. Afterwards, he descended\r\nwith candles; but, finding a great disadvantage from their consumption of\r\nvital air, he caused, previously to his next experiment, a small window of\r\nthick glass to be made near the bow of his boat, and he again descended\r\nwith her, on the 24th July, 1801. He found that he received from his\r\nwindow, or rather aperture covered with glass, for it was no more than an\r\ninch and a half in diameter, sufficient light to enable him to count the\r\nminutes on his watch. Having satisfied himself that he could have\r\nsufficient light when under water, that he could do without a supply of\r\nfresh air for a considerable time, that he could descend to any depth, and\r\nrise to the surface with facility, his next object was to try her\r\nmovements as well on the surface as beneath it. On the 26th July he\r\nweighed his anchor and hoisted his sails; his boat had one mast, a\r\nmainsail, and a jib. There was only a light breeze, and, therefore, she\r\ndid not move on the surface at more than the rate of two miles an hour,\r\nbut it was found that she would tack and steer, and sail on a wind or\r\nbefore it, as well as any common sailing-boat. He then struck her mast and\r\nsails; to do which, and perfectly to prepare the boat for plunging,\r\nrequired about two minutes. Having plunged to a certain depth, he placed\r\ntwo men at the engine, which was intended to give her progressive motion,\r\nand one at the helm, while he, with a barometer before him, governed the\r\nmachine which kept her balanced between the upper and lower waters. He\r\nfound that with the exertion of one hand only, he could keep her at any\r\ndepth he pleased. The propelling engine was then put in motion, and he\r\nfound, upon coming to the surface, that he had made, in about seven\r\nminutes, a progress of four hundred meters, or about five hundred yards.\r\nHe then again plunged, turned her round while under water, and returned to\r\nnear the place he began to move from. He repeated his experiments several\r\ndays successively, until he became familiar with the operations of the\r\nmachinery and the movements of the boat. He found that she was as obedient\r\nto her helm under water as any boat could be on the surface; and that the\r\nmagnetic needle traversed as well in the one situation as in the other. On\r\nthe 7th August, Mr. Fulton again descended with a store of atmospheric air\r\ncompressed into a copper globe of a cubic foot capacity, into which two\r\nhundred atmospheres were forced. Thus prepared, he descended with three\r\ncompanions to the depth of about five feet. At the expiration of an hour\r\nand forty minutes, he began to take small supplies of _pure_ air from his\r\nreservoir, and did so, as he found occasion, for four hours and twenty\r\nminutes. At the expiration of this time he came to the surface, without\r\nhaving experienced any inconvenience from having been so long under\r\nwater.”\r\n\r\nFulton’s boat is pretty evidently the original from which Jules Verne took\r\nthe idea of his wonderful submarine ship, the _Nautilus_. It was utilised\r\nfor an important torpedo experiment, and a shallop was successfully blown\r\nup at Brest in the presence of Admiral Villaret and other officials. The\r\nsubmarine boat approached within two hundred yards of the hull which was\r\nto be destroyed, and fired its torpedo under water. The French Government\r\nemployed him for a time to cruise about and watch our vessels, but no\r\nopportunity seems to have occurred for any attack, and he was evidently\r\nlooked upon as a failure. In 1803, a correspondence passed between the\r\nEnglish Government and Fulton, and he was induced to come to London, where\r\nhe had an interview with Mr. Pitt and Lord Melville. “When Mr. Pitt first\r\nsaw a drawing of a torpedo, with a sketch of the mode of applying it, and\r\nunderstood what would be the effects of its explosion, he said, that if\r\nintroduced into practice, it could not fail to annihilate all military\r\nmarines.” Fulton accompanied an expedition sent against the French\r\nflotilla in the roads of Boulogne, where his torpedoes were launched, but\r\ndid no damage.\r\n\r\nOn the 15th October, 1805, he blew up a strongly built Danish brig, of the\r\nburden of 200 tons, which had been provided for the experiment, and which\r\nwas anchored in Walmer roads, near Deal; within a mile of Walmer Castle,\r\nthe then residence of Mr. Pitt. He has given an interesting account of\r\nthis experiment in a pamphlet which he published in this country, under\r\nthe title of “Torpedo War.” In a letter to Lord Castlereagh, of the 16th\r\nOctober, 1805, he says, “Yesterday, about four o’clock, I made the\r\nintended experiment on the brig, with a carcass of one hundred and seventy\r\npounds of powder; and I have the pleasure to inform you that it succeeded\r\nbeyond my most sanguine expectations. Exactly in fifteen minutes from the\r\ntime of drawing the peg and throwing the carcass into the water, the\r\nexplosion took place. It lifted the brig almost bodily, and broke her\r\ncompletely in two. The ends sunk immediately, and in one minute nothing\r\nwas to be seen of her but floating fragments. Her mainmast and pumps were\r\nthrown in the sea; her foremast was broken in three pieces; her beams and\r\nknees were thrown from her deck and sides, and her deck planks were rent\r\nto fibres. In fact, her annihilation was complete, and the effect was most\r\nextraordinary. The power, as I had calculated, passed in a right line\r\nthrough her body, that being the line of least resistance, and carried all\r\nbefore it. At the time of her going up she did not appear to make more\r\nresistance than a bag of feathers, and went to pieces like a shattered\r\negg-shell.”\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the complete success of the experiment, the British\r\nministry seem to have been but little disposed to have anything further to\r\ndo with Mr. Fulton and his projects. Indeed, the evidence it afforded of\r\ntheir efficiency may have been a reason for this. However Mr. Pitt and\r\nLord Melville may have thought on the subject, there had been a change in\r\nthe administration, and the new ministers probably agreed with the Earl\r\nSt. Vincent, that it was great folly in them to encourage a project which,\r\nif it succeeded, would revolutionise all maritime questions. Lord\r\nGrenville and his Cabinet were not only indisposed to encourage Mr.\r\nFulton, but they were unwilling to fulfil the engagements which their\r\npredecessors had made, and that inventor, after some further experiments,\r\nof which we have no particular account, wearied with incessant\r\napplications, disappointments, and neglect, at length embarked for his\r\nnative country.\r\n\r\nBut Fulton’s greatest fame rests on his steam-boats. In his first attempt\r\nmade in France, where he was aided by Mr. Robert R. Livingston, a\r\nfellow-countryman, he was not successful. Their experimental boat was\r\ncompleted early in the spring of 1803; they were on the point of making an\r\nexperiment with her, when one morning, as Mr. Fulton was rising from a bed\r\nin which anxiety had given him but little rest, a messenger from the boat,\r\nwhose precipitation and apparent consternation announced that he was the\r\nbearer of bad tidings, presented himself to him, and exclaimed in accents\r\nof despair, “Oh, sir, the boat has broken to pieces and gone to the\r\nbottom!” Mr. Fulton, who himself related the anecdote, declared that the\r\nnews created a despondency which he had never felt on any other occasion;\r\nbut this was only a momentary sensation. Upon examination, he found the\r\nboat had been too weakly framed to bear the great weight of the machinery,\r\nand that, in consequence of an agitation of the river by wind the\r\npreceding night, what the messenger had represented had literally\r\nhappened. The boat had broken in two, and the weight of her machinery had\r\ncarried her fragments to the bottom. It appeared to him, as he said, that\r\nthe fruits of so many months’ labour, and so much expense, were\r\nannihilated, and an opportunity of demonstrating the efficiency of his\r\nplan was denied him at the moment he had promised it should be displayed.\r\nHis disappointment and feelings may easily be imagined, but they did not\r\ncheck his perseverance. On the very day that this misfortune happened, he\r\ncommenced repairing it. He did not sit down idly to repine at misfortunes\r\nwhich his manly exertions might remedy, or waste in fruitless lamentations\r\na moment of that time in which the accident might be repaired. Without\r\nreturning to his lodgings, he immediately began to labour with his own\r\nhands to raise the boat, and worked for four and twenty hours incessantly,\r\nwithout allowing himself rest or refreshment; an imprudence which, as he\r\nalways supposed, had a permanently bad effect on his constitution, and to\r\nwhich he imputed much of his subsequent ill health.\r\n\r\nThe accident did the machinery very little injury; but they were obliged\r\nto build the boat almost entirely anew. She was completed in July; her\r\nlength was sixty-six feet, and she was eight feet wide. Early in August,\r\nMr. Fulton addressed a letter to the French National Institute, inviting\r\nthem to witness a trial of his boat, which was made in their presence, and\r\nin the presence of a great multitude of the Parisians. The experiment was\r\nentirely satisfactory to Mr. Fulton, though the boat did not move\r\naltogether with as much speed as he expected. But he imputed her moving so\r\nslowly to the extremely defective fabrication of the machinery, and to\r\nimperfections which were to be expected in the first experiment with so\r\ncomplicated a machine, but which he saw might be easily remedied. Such\r\nentire confidence did he acquire from this experiment, that immediately\r\nafterwards he wrote to Messrs. Watt and Boulton, of Birmingham, ordering\r\ncertain parts of a steam-engine to be made for him and sent to America. He\r\ndid not disclose to them for what purpose the engine was intended, but his\r\ndirections were such as would produce the parts of an engine that might be\r\nput together within a compass suited to a boat. Mr. Fulton then designed\r\nto return to America immediately; but, as we have seen, he first visited\r\nEngland, and it is probable that he then gave new orders on this subject,\r\nas we find that the engine which was employed in the first American Fulton\r\nboat was of the manufacture of Messrs. Watt and Boulton, but it did not\r\narrive in America till long after the time of which we are speaking.\r\n\r\nMr. Livingston also wrote immediately after this experiment to his friends\r\nin America, and through their interference, an Act was passed by the\r\nLegislature of the State of New York, on the 5th of April, 1803, by which\r\nthe rights and exclusive privileges of navigating all the waters of that\r\nState, by vessels propelled by fire or steam, granted to Mr. Livingston by\r\nthe Act of 1798, were extended to Mr. Livingston and Mr. Fulton for the\r\nterm of twenty years from the date of the new Act. By this law, the time\r\nfor producing proof of the practicability of propelling by steam a boat of\r\ntwenty tons’ capacity, at the rate of four miles an hour, with wind\r\nagainst the ordinary current of the Hudson River, was extended for a\r\nperiod of two years. And by a subsequent law the time was enlarged to\r\nApril, 1807.\r\n\r\nVery soon after Mr. Fulton’s arrival in New York he commenced building the\r\nfirst American boat. While she was constructing, he found that her\r\nexpenses would greatly exceed his calculation. He endeavoured to lessen\r\nthe pressure on his own finances by offering one-third of the exclusive\r\nright which was secured to him and Mr. Livingston by the laws of New York,\r\nand of his patent rights, for a proportionate contribution to the expense.\r\nHe made this offer to several gentlemen, and it was very generally known\r\nthat he had made such propositions; but no one was then willing to afford\r\nthis aid to his enterprise.\r\n\r\n“In the spring of 1807, the first Fulton boat built in America was\r\nlaunched from the ship-yards of Charles Brown, on the East River. The\r\nengine from England was put on board of her; in August she was completed,\r\nand was moved by her machinery from her birth-place to the Jersey shore.\r\nMr. Livingston and Mr. Fulton had invited many of their friends to witness\r\nthe first trial. Nothing could exceed the surprise and admiration of all\r\nwho witnessed the experiment. The minds of the most incredulous were\r\nchanged in a few minutes. Before the boat had made the progress of a\r\nquarter of a mile, the greatest unbeliever must have been converted. The\r\nman who, while he looked on the expensive machine, thanked his stars that\r\nhe had more wisdom than to waste his money on such idle schemes, changed\r\nthe expression of his features as the boat moved from the wharf and gained\r\nher speed; his complacent smile gradually stiffened into an expression of\r\nwonder. The jeers of the ignorant, who had neither sense nor feeling\r\nenough to suppress their contemptuous ridicule and rude jokes, were\r\nsilenced for a moment by a vulgar astonishment, which deprived them of the\r\npower of utterance, till the triumph of genius extorted from the\r\nincredulous multitude which crowded the shores shouts and exclamations of\r\ncongratulation and applause.”\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that Fulton derived his general plan from the\r\nexperiments of Symington. While that engineer was conducting his\r\nexperiments under the patronage of Lord Dundas, a stranger came to the\r\nbanks of the Forth and Clyde Canal and requested an interview, announcing\r\nhimself as Mr. Fulton, of the United States, whither he intended to\r\nreturn, and expressing a desire to see Mr. Symington’s boat and machinery,\r\nand to procure some information of the principles on which it was moved,\r\nbefore he left Europe. He remarked that, however beneficial the invention\r\nmight be to Great Britain, it would be of more importance to North\r\nAmerica, considering the numerous navigable rivers and lakes of that\r\ncontinent, and the facility for procuring timber for building vessels and\r\nsupplying them with fuel; that the usefulness of steam-vessels in a\r\nmercantile point of view could not fail to attract the attention of every\r\nobserver; and that, if he were allowed to carry the plan to the United\r\nStates, it would be advantageous to Mr. Symington, as, if his engagements\r\nwould permit, the constructing or superintending the construction of such\r\nvessels would naturally devolve upon him. Mr. Symington, in compliance\r\nwith the stranger’s request, caused the engine-fire to be lighted, and the\r\nmachinery put in motion. Several persons entered the boat, and along with\r\nMr. Fulton were carried from where she then lay to Lock No. 16 on the\r\nForth and Clyde Canal, about four miles west, and returned to the\r\nstarting-place in one hour and twenty minutes, being at the rate of six\r\nmiles an hour, to the astonishment of Mr. Fulton and the other gentlemen.\r\nMr. Fulton obtained leave to take notes and sketches regarding the boat\r\nand engine, “but he never afterwards communicated with Mr. Symington.”(27)\r\nHe, it has been shown, almost immediately afterwards ordered a marine\r\nengine from Messrs. Boulton and Watt, of Soho, near Birmingham. This\r\nengine reached America before the _Clermont_, which had been constructed\r\nat the instance of Fulton and Livingston, had been launched from the yard\r\nof Charles Brown, on the East (Hudson) River. She was decked for a short\r\ndistance only, at stem and stern, her engines being open to view, while a\r\nhouse on deck, and over the boiler, accommodated passengers and crew. _The\r\nboiler was set in masonry._ Her engine was of almost identical size to\r\nthat of the _Charlotte Dundas_. It is right to add that Fulton claimed no\r\npatent or privilege for this engine, which was so evidently founded on\r\nthat of Symington. Her hull was quite as distinctly his own design, and\r\nwas vastly superior in build to the Scotch vessel. The first trip of the\r\n_Clermont_ was from New York to Clermont, the seat of Mr. Livingston,\r\nreturning to Albany, and the average speed was five miles per hour.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: THE “CLERMONT.”]\r\n\r\n“The _Clermont_, on her first voyage, arrived at her destination without\r\nany accident. She excited the astonishment of the inhabitants of the\r\nshores of the Hudson, many of whom had not heard even of an engine, much\r\nless of a steam-boat. There were many descriptions of the effects of her\r\nfirst appearance upon the people on the banks of the river; some of those\r\nwere ridiculous, but some of them were of such a character as nothing but\r\nan object of real grandeur could have excited. She was described by some\r\nwho had indistinctly seen her passing in the night, to those who had not\r\nhad a view of her, as a monster moving on the waters, defying the winds\r\nand tide, and breathing flames and smoke. She had the most terrific\r\nappearance from other vessels which were navigating the river when she was\r\nmaking her passage. The first steam-boats, as others yet do, used dry\r\npine-wood for fuel, which sends forth a column of ignited vapour many feet\r\nabove the flue, and whenever the fire is stirred a galaxy of sparks fly\r\noff, and in the night have a very brilliant and beautiful appearance. This\r\nuncommon light first attracted the attention of the crews of other\r\nvessels. Notwithstanding the wind and tide were adverse to its approach,\r\nthey saw with astonishment that it was rapidly coming towards them; and\r\nwhen it came so near as that the noise of the machinery and paddles was\r\nheard, the crews (if what was said in the newspapers of the time be true),\r\nin some instances, shrunk beneath their decks from the terrific sight, and\r\nleft their vessels to go on shore, while others prostrated themselves, and\r\nbesought Providence to protect them from the approaches of the horrible\r\nmonster which was marching on the tides and lighting its path by the fires\r\nwhich it vomited.”\r\n\r\nThe _Clermont_ was soon afterwards lengthened and considerably improved in\r\nappearance and usefulness. Her hull was covered from stem to stern with a\r\nflush deck, beneath which two cabins were formed, surrounded by double\r\nranges of berths, and fitted up with great regard to comfort. Her\r\ndimensions now were—length, 130 feet; breadth, 16½ feet; diameter of\r\npaddle-wheels, 15 feet, the paddles dipping into the water 2 feet. Fulton\r\nafterwards built a number of steam-boats, and, it will be well understood,\r\nencountered a vast deal of opposition from the owners of sailing craft and\r\nferry-boats. Attempts were also made to put forward rival inventions, and\r\na company was started who proposed to navigate boats on the Hudson by the\r\nfollowing somewhat incomprehensible mode of propulsion. The quotation is\r\nfrom the biography of Fulton(28) by his friend, C. D. Colden:—\r\n\r\n“The opposition boats on the Hudson, which the owners had built to rival\r\nthe steam-boats, were at first to have been propelled by a pendulum,\r\nwhich, according to the calculations of some ingenious gentlemen, would\r\ngive a greater power than steam, but when their boat came to be put in the\r\nwater they soon found that their wheels, which were turned with great\r\nfacility and velocity while their vessel was on the stocks, could not be\r\nmade to perform their functions without the application of a great power\r\nto the pendulum. The projectors were utterly at a loss to account for so\r\nextraordinary a phenomenon, and could not conceive why the wheels, which\r\nhad moved so much to their satisfaction when they were resisted only by\r\nthe air, should require so much force when they turned in the water, and\r\nwere to drag the weight of the vessel. But having by actual experiment\r\ndetermined that a pendulum would not supply the place of steam, and\r\nknowing no other way of supplying steam than that which they saw practised\r\nin the Fulton boats, they adopted all their machinery with some very\r\ninsignificant alterations, which were made with no other view than to give\r\nthose persons who had set out by professing to make a pendulum-boat a\r\npretence for claiming to be the inventors of improvements in steam-boats.”\r\n\r\nFulton, without doubt, designed and superintended the construction of the\r\nfirst steam war-vessel. On the 20th June, 1814, the keel was laid, and in\r\nlittle more than four months, that is, on the 29th October, she was\r\nlaunched from the yard of Adam and Noah Brown, her able and active\r\narchitects. The scene exhibited on that occasion was magnificent. It\r\nhappened on one of the brightest autumnal days. “Spectators,” says Colden,\r\n“crowded the surrounding shores, and were seen upon the hills which\r\nlimited the beautiful prospect. The river and bay were filled with vessels\r\nof war, dressed in all their variety of colours, in compliment to the\r\noccasion. In the midst of these was the enormous floating mass whose bulk\r\nand unwieldy form seemed to render her as unfit for motion as the land\r\nbatteries which were saluting her. Through the fleet of vessels which\r\noccupied this part of the harbour were seen gliding in every direction\r\nseveral of our large steam-boats, of the burden of three or four hundred\r\ntons. These, with bands of music, and crowds of gay and joyous company,\r\nwere winding through passages left by the anchored vessels as if they were\r\nmoved by enchantment. The heart could not have been human that did not\r\nshare in the general enthusiasm expressed by the loud shouts of the\r\nmultitude. He could not have been a worthy citizen, who did not then say\r\nto himself, with pride and exultation, ‘This is my country!’ and when he\r\nlooked on the man whose single genius had created the most interesting\r\nobjects of the scene, ‘This is my countryman!’”\r\n\r\nBy May, 1815, her engine was put on board, and she was so far completed as\r\nto afford an opportunity of trying her machinery. But, unhappily, before\r\nthis period the mind that had conceived and combined it was gone. Fulton,\r\nalmost to the last day of his life, worked incessantly at this, the first\r\nsteam war-vessel.\r\n\r\nOn the 4th July, in the same year, the steam frigate made a passage from\r\nNew York to the ocean and back, and went the distance—which, going and\r\nreturning, is fifty-three miles—in eight hours and twenty minutes, by the\r\nmere force of her engine. These trials suggested the correction of some\r\nerrors, and the supplying of some defects in the machinery. In September\r\nshe made another passage to the sea, and having at this time the weight of\r\nher whole armament on board, she went at an average of five and a half\r\nmiles an hour, with and against tide. When stemming the tide, which ran at\r\nthe rate of three miles an hour, she advanced at the rate of two and a\r\nhalf miles an hour.\r\n\r\nWe now reach the period which brings us to practical steam navigation in\r\nEurope. In January, 1812, Henry Bell, of Helensburgh, Scotland, completed\r\nthe construction of a small passenger steam vessel, the _Comet_, of thirty\r\ntons burden. She was only forty feet in length, with an engine of\r\nthree-horse power. The circular which announced its regular trips is worth\r\nreprinting, as it is the first advertisement of the kind made in all\r\nEurope. It reads as follows:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“STEAM PASSAGE BOAT, THE _COMET_, BETWEEN GLASGOW, GREENOCK, AND\r\nHELENSBURGH FOR PASSENGERS ONLY.\r\n\r\n“The Subscriber having, at much expense, fitted up a handsome vessel to\r\nply upon the river Clyde, between Glasgow and Greenock, to sail by the\r\npower of wind, air and steam, he intends that the vessel shall leave the\r\nBroomielaw on Tuesdays, Thursdays, and Saturdays about mid-day, or at such\r\nhour thereafter as may answer from the state of the tide; and to leave\r\nGreenock on Mondays, Wednesdays, and Fridays in the morning, to suit the\r\ntide.\r\n\r\n“The elegance, comfort, safety, and speed of this vessel requires only to\r\nbe proved to meet the approbation of the public; and the proprietor is\r\ndetermined to do everything in his power to merit public encouragement.\r\n\r\n“The terms are for the present fixed at four shillings for the best cabin,\r\nand three shillings for the second, but beyond these rates nothing is to\r\nbe allowed to servants or any other person employed about the vessel.\r\n\r\n“The Subscriber continues his establishment at Helensburgh Baths, the same\r\nas for years past, and a vessel will be in readiness to convey passengers\r\nin the _Comet_ from Greenock to Helensburgh.\r\n\r\n“Passengers by the _Comet_ will receive information of the hour of sailing\r\nby applying at Mr. Houslem’s office, Broomielaw, or Mr. Thomas Blackney’s,\r\nEast Quay Head, Greenock.\r\n\r\n                                                    “(Signed), HENRY BELL.\r\n“Helensburgh Baths, Aug. 5, 1812.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: BELL’S “COMET.”]\r\n\r\nBell’s claims to recognition are very much the same as those of Fulton and\r\nLivingston in the United States. He was instrumental in bringing steam\r\nnavigation to a practical issue, but was not its inventor or first\r\nintroducer. In 1816, he addressed an interesting letter to the _Caledonian\r\nMercury_, showing the intimacy which existed between himself and Fulton,\r\nand proving that the leaders of the new steam movement were in frequent\r\ncommunication. In this letter he commences by recapitulating Miller’s\r\nexperiments in propelling vessels or rafts by paddles worked by capstans\r\nor by wind, like a windmill. These ideas were communicated to all the\r\nCourts of Europe, and the French, at one time, actually proposed something\r\nof the nature of rafts worked by Miller’s plan, for the conveyance of\r\ntroops to England. Miller sent one of his capstan vessels as a present to\r\nthe King of Sweden. Bell makes the following statement:—\r\n\r\n“Fulton came to the knowledge of steam-boats by employing me (H. Bell)\r\nabout some plans of machinery, and begged me to call on Miller and see how\r\nhe had succeeded in his steam-boat plan; and if it answered, to send him\r\nfull drawings and description along with my machinery. I had a\r\nconversation with Miller, who gave me every information. I (H. Bell) told\r\nhim that his engineer was wrong, and that I intended giving Fulton my\r\nopinion on steam-boats. I left Fulton’s letter with Miller.\r\n\r\n“Two years after, a letter from Fulton arrived, stating that he had\r\nconstructed a steam-boat from the drawings I had sent him, but\r\nimprovements were required. This letter I also sent to Miller.”\r\n\r\nHe goes on to say that he set on foot his steam-boat after making various\r\nmodels, and when convinced they would answer, contracted with John Wood\r\nand Co., ship-builders, Port Glasgow, to build the _Comet_, so called from\r\na comet which appeared in Scotland at that period. He claims that the\r\n_Comet_ was the first steam-vessel built in Europe “that would work,” but\r\nthis is unfair to the memories of Miller and Symington.\r\n\r\nOddly enough, while Bell was experimenting on the Clyde, Mr. Dawson was\r\ndoing the same in Ireland. He even claims that he built a fifty-ton\r\nsteamer in 1811, and which, by a coincidence simply, as it would seem, he\r\nhad also named the _Comet_. He put the first steamer for public\r\naccommodation on the Thames in 1818, to run between London and Gravesend.\r\nMr. Lawrence, of Bristol, introduced a steam-boat on the Severn shortly\r\nafter Bell put the _Comet_ on the Clyde, and brought her to London, but so\r\ngreat was the opposition from the watermen that he took her back to\r\nBristol. She was afterwards taken to Spain, and long plied between Seville\r\nand St. Lucar. These were the precursors of those grand steam-ship lines\r\nwhich now run to every part of the habitable world. Bell’s steamer was\r\nmade, in the second year of its career, a pleasure-boat to many parts of\r\nthe coasts of England, Scotland, and Ireland, and may therefore count as\r\none of the first ocean-going as well as river steamers.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: FOUR GREAT ENGINEERS.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE HISTORY OF SHIPS AND SHIPPING INTERESTS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n       The Clyde and its Ship-building Interests—From Henry Bell to\r\n       Modern Ship-builders—The First Royal Naval Steamer—The First\r\n    Regular Sea-going Steamer—The Revolution in Ship-building—The Iron\r\n               Age—“Will Iron Float?”—The Invention of the\r\n         Screw-propeller—Ericsson, Smith, and Woodcroft—American\r\n    ’Cuteness—Captain Stockton and his Boat—The First Steamer to Cross\r\n       the Atlantic—Voyages of the _Sirius_ and _Great Western_—The\r\n     International Struggle—The Collins and Cunard Lines—Fate of the\r\n    _Arctic_—The _Pacific_ never heard of more—Why the Cunard Company\r\n    has been Successful—Splendid Discipline on Board their Vessels—The\r\n                      Fleets that Leave the Mersey.\r\n\r\n\r\nWhat a contrast to the days of Henry Bell does the Clyde now present! From\r\na mere salmon stream it has become, in little more than half a century, by\r\nfar the largest and most important ship-building river in the wide world.\r\n“Ancient historians have told us that when the first Punic war roused the\r\ncitizens of Rome to extraordinary exertions in the equipment of a fleet\r\nfor the destruction of the maritime supremacy of Carthage, the banks of\r\nthe Tiber resounded with the axe and the hammer, and that the extent of\r\nthe ship-building operations then carried on was a matter not merely of\r\nsurprise, but of wonder. How insignificant, however, was that sound when\r\ncompared with that of the steam-hammer and the anvil, and the din of the\r\nwork now to be heard on the banks of the Clyde. For miles on both sides of\r\nthe river stupendous ship-building yards line its banks, employing tens of\r\nthousands of hardy and skilled mechanics earning their daily bread, as God\r\nhas destined all men to do, by ‘the sweat of their brow.’... Along those\r\nbanks there is now annually constructed a much larger amount of steam\r\ntonnage than in all the other ports of Europe combined, those of England\r\nalone excepted.” These great private yards have been and will be\r\ninvaluable in war times. Take such a firm as that of John Elder and Co.,\r\nFairfield, Glasgow, whose works cover sixty acres of ground. They have\r\nbuilt vessels in the course of a year aggregating 35,000 to 40,000 tons,\r\nand have contracted for as many as six 4,000-ton steam-ships at a time.\r\nOne of these was delivered to her owners complete and ready for sea, with\r\nsteam up, within thirteen months of the time she was contracted for.\r\nBell’s _Comet_ was only of thirty tons, and its engine but of four-horse\r\npower! Mr. James Deas, C.E., in a work on the Clyde and its commerce, &c.,\r\nsays:—“It was no uncommon occurrence for the passengers, when the little\r\nsteamer was getting exhausted, to take to turning the fly-wheel to assist\r\nher.”(29) Poor Bell, like so many of the pioneers of grand and important\r\nundertakings, did not profit much by his successful application of steam\r\nto navigation, and in his declining years was chiefly supported by an\r\nannuity of £50 granted by the Clyde trustees.\r\n\r\nWhile the public, after the successful experiments already mentioned, and\r\nothers which followed, were beginning to appreciate the value of steamers,\r\nthe Admiralty would have nothing to do with them, and it took them about\r\nforty years before they reluctantly applied steam to war vessels. The\r\nabsolutely first steam vessel built for the Royal Navy was a tug, also\r\nnamed the _Comet_. She was constructed in 1819, after some experiments had\r\nconvinced Lord Melville and Sir George Cockburn of the value of steam\r\npower in towing men-of-war. “At this period, Mr. Ronnie, who planned the\r\nbreakwater at Plymouth and new London Bridge, was ‘advising engineer’ to\r\nthe Admiralty, and on every occasion urged the application of steam power\r\nto vessels of war. More than this, he hired at his own cost the Margate\r\nsteam-boat, the _Eclipse_, and successfully towed the _Eastings_, 74,\r\nagainst the tide from Woolwich to Gravesend, June 14th, 1819. On this, the\r\nAdmiralty, supported by Lord Melville, gave up their objections.”(30)\r\n\r\nStill, practically, it was not till after the Crimean war that steam\r\nbecame the leading motive power in our war navy. The merchants were more\r\nsensible. Mr. David Napier had, in 1818, launched a steamer of ninety tons\r\nburden—the _Rob Roy_—from the yard of Mr. William Denny, of Dumbarton. For\r\ntwo years she ran between Glasgow and Belfast, carrying the mails, and was\r\nthe first regular _sea-going steamer_ which had been built in either\r\nEurope or the United States. But she also calls for particular mention for\r\nanother reason: she was subsequently transferred to the English Channel as\r\na packet-boat between Dover and Calais. And there are still, no doubt,\r\nmany travellers or residents of those towns who can remember the\r\ninauguration of what is now a most important service. The same Napier,\r\nwhose name is very intimately connected with the history of the marine\r\nengine, which he was constantly striving to improve, inaugurated, with the\r\nassistance of capitalists, a line between Liverpool, Greenock, and\r\nGlasgow. Next followed a line from London to Leith, which commenced with\r\ntwo steamers, each fitted with engines of fifty horse-power. Now came an\r\nimmense advance, for in 1826, the first of the then considered “leviathan”\r\nclass of steamers—the _United Kingdom_—was built for the trade between\r\nLondon and Edinburgh. She was 160 feet long, with engines of 200\r\nhorse-power. “People flocked from all quarters to inspect and admire her.”\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: THE “UNITED KINGDOM”.\r\n                 (_From a Drawing by E. W. Cooke, R.A._)]\r\n\r\nAlthough these two lines of regular steam communication between Liverpool\r\nand the river Clyde, and between London and Edinburgh, were now\r\nsuccessfully established and proved of considerable importance in the\r\nencouragement of steam navigation elsewhere, some years elapsed before\r\nthose rapid strides were made in its adaptation as a propelling power\r\nwhich have rendered it one of the wonders of the present age. Indeed, this\r\npower would probably never have made such an extraordinary advance had\r\niron not been adopted instead of wood for the construction of our ships.\r\n\r\nHitherto throughout all ages, timber alone had been used in ship-building.\r\nThe forests of Lebanon had supplied the naval architects of Tyre with\r\ntheir materials; Italy cultivated her woods with unusual care so that\r\nsufficient trees might be grown for the timber-planking and masts of ships\r\nfor its once powerful maritime republics; and in our own time how often\r\nhave we heard fears expressed that Great Britain would not be able to\r\ncontinue the supply of sufficient oak for her royal dockyards, much less\r\nfor her merchant fleets? Yet, when shrewd, far-seeing men, no farther back\r\nthan the year 1830, talked about substituting iron for the “ribs” of a\r\nship instead of “timber,” and iron plates for “planking” instead of oak,\r\nwhat, a howl of derision the public raised.\r\n\r\n“‘Who ever heard of iron floating?’ they derisively inquired,” says\r\nLindsay. “It is true they might have seen old tin kettles float on every\r\npool of water before their doors almost any day of their lives—nay,\r\nfloating even more buoyantly than their discarded wooden coal-boxes, but\r\nsuch common-place instructors were beneath their notice. Timber-built\r\nships had from time immemorial been in use in every nation and on every\r\nsea, and had bravely battled with the storm from the days of Noah, and\r\nwere these, they sneeringly asked, to be supplanted by a material which in\r\nitself would naturally sink? Such was the reasoning of the period; and,\r\nindeed, the best of the arguments against the use of iron rested on\r\nscarcely more solid foundation.”(31)\r\n\r\nIt is true that so early as 1809, Richard Trevethick and Robert Dickenson\r\nhad proposed to build “large ships with decks, beams, and sides of plate\r\niron,” and had even suggested “masts, yards, and spars” of iron, which\r\nlatter are now by no means uncommon. “But,” says Lindsay, “as these\r\ninventors or patentees did not put their ideas into practice, no other\r\nperson (if, indeed, any other person gave even a passing thought to the\r\nsubject) was convinced that any craft beyond a boat or a river-barge could\r\nbe constructed of iron, much less that if made in the form of a ship, this\r\nmaterial would oppose more effectual resistance to the storms of the\r\nocean, or, if dashed upon the strand, to the angry fury of the waves, than\r\ntimber, however scientifically put together. But though no available\r\nsubstance can withstand the raging elements with less chance of\r\ndestruction than plates of iron riveted together in the form of a boiler\r\n(the principle on which iron ships are now constructed), the public could\r\nnot then appreciate their superior value; and it was not until 1818 that\r\nthe first _iron vessel_ was built.” This vessel is in use even now. Three\r\nyears afterwards a steam-engine was, for the first time, fitted into a\r\nvessel built of iron—the _Aaron Manby_—constructed for Mr. Manby and\r\nCaptain Napier, afterwards Admiral Sir Charles Napier. Gradually the\r\nsuitableness of these vessels was becoming apparent, and from this time\r\ndates the establishment of some of the greatest ship-building yards, like\r\nthose of the Lairds and Fairbairns. In 1834 the first-named firm built the\r\n_Garry Owen_ for service between Limerick and Kilrush. Almost fortunately,\r\nshe was driven on shore with a number of wooden vessels, all of which were\r\nwrecked or seriously damaged, while she got off with scarcely any damage,\r\nand the credit of iron vessels became improved. But another of the chief\r\nand more tenable objections to the extended use of iron vessels was the\r\nperturbation of the compass. This has been clearly shown to proceed almost\r\nentirely from the proximity of iron _not_ forming a part of the _hull_ of\r\nthe ship, the magnetic influence of which is comparatively even all round.\r\nA funnel, tank, boilers, the machinery, the iron fastenings even of a\r\ndeck-house, &c., may all have their influences. Still these influences are\r\nnow regulated and understood, and iron ships are more commonly employed\r\nthan those of wood, showing that it is not an objection which can be urged\r\nto-day. After the early steamers came by degrees iron sailing vessels,\r\ntill at length we find iron applied to a grand steamer, magnificent then\r\nand first-class still, the _Great Britain_. “Experience by degrees\r\nsuccessfully met almost every objection; and science was again triumphant\r\nover prejudice and ignorance. Iron had been made not merely to float, but\r\nto ride buoyantly over the crest of the wave amid the raging elements.”\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: SECTION AND PLAN OF THE STERN OF A SCREW STEAMER.]\r\n\r\nThen came the introduction of the screw-propeller, which, if we are to\r\nbelieve some authorities, is an early invention of the Chinese. There have\r\nbeen many claims to its invention in modern times. In May, 1804, Mr. J.\r\nStevens, of the United States, put to sea with a steam-boat propelled with\r\nsome form of screw. Trevethick, the engineer, in 1815, patented “a worm or\r\nscrew revolving in a cylinder at the head, sides, or stern of a vessel;”\r\nand the following year, Robert Kinder applied for a patent for a shaft and\r\nscrew almost of exactly the form now in use. The French claim it, and only\r\na few years since erected at Boulogne a monument to Frédéric Sauvage, as\r\nits inventor. On the front is a bronze bas-relief showing a vessel with a\r\nscrew-propeller. Sauvage’s life was similar to those of many other\r\ninventors, in that he spent his days and fortune in perfecting inventions\r\nwhich brought him no profit. Having lost his own money, and got into great\r\ndifficulties, he was thrown into a debtors’ prison, and subsequently ended\r\nhis days in a madhouse. Lindsay remarks properly that “the number of\r\nclaimants to every important invention is remarkable. An impartial student\r\nwill, however, probably come to the conclusion that the invention of the\r\nscrew and its application was, like that of the steam-engine itself, the\r\nsole property of no one man.” The time for its development and proper use\r\nhad come, and many scientific students were inquiring concerning its\r\nvalue.\r\n\r\nThere can be little doubt that the first demonstration in our country of\r\nits value on a proper scale and in convincing form, was that made by\r\nCaptain John Ericsson, a Swedish engineer resident in London. After a\r\nsuccessful experiment with a model, he had a boat built forty-five feet in\r\nlength, and fitted with engine and two propellers. She was named the\r\n_Francis B. Ogden_. “The result of her first trial went far beyond his\r\nmost sanguine expectations. No sooner were the engines put at full speed,\r\nthan she shot ahead at the rate of more than ten miles an hour.”\r\nAfterwards she towed a schooner of 140 tons burden at seven miles an hour.\r\nThe next experiment was made in the presence of the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty, and they were minute in their inspection. Ericsson felt\r\nconfident that they were convinced, and would soon order the construction\r\nof a war-vessel on the new principle. In this, however, he was\r\ndisappointed, though he had given them a tolerably good proof of its value\r\nby towing their barge at the rate of ten miles an hour for a considerable\r\ndistance. Scientific theorists reported against it, and said that a ship\r\nthus propelled would be unsteerable. Lindsay records how Admiral Beechey,\r\none of the old school, in 1850, stated that “he did not believe that the\r\nnavy of the future—the Royal Navy—ever could consist of steamers! Nor\r\ncould he endure iron ships.”\r\n\r\nWhile Ericsson was thus employed, Mr. Thomas Pettit Smith, who, on the\r\n31st May, 1836, had taken out a patent for a “sort of screw or ‘worm,’\r\nmade to revolve rapidly under water in a recess or open space formed in\r\nthat part of the after-part of the vessel commonly called the dead rising\r\nor dead wood of the stern,” was experimenting, and the following year\r\nexhibited it in practical form in a small vessel. It appeared to several\r\ngentlemen so satisfactory that a company was formed in July, 1839, to\r\npurchase the patent. It was now applied to a vessel called the\r\n_Archimedes_, the burden of which was 237 tons, and although her speed was\r\nsomewhat less than Ericsson’s vessel, the trial was undeniably\r\nsatisfactory, more especially as it was obvious that her engine was really\r\nnot large enough for a propeller of the size. In her next trials against\r\nthe _Widgeon_, the fastest paddle-wheel steamer then running between Dover\r\nand Calais, the success of the screw might be regarded as an established\r\nfact. The _Archimedes_ laboured under the disadvantage of having ten\r\nhorse-power less steam, while her burden was seventy-five tons more; she\r\nhad the advantage of carrying more sail. On the first three trials the\r\n_Widgeon_ had a very slight advantage, in spite of her superior\r\nsteam-power and smaller tonnage, while on the last two the _Archimedes_\r\nmade the trip in less time than it had ever previously been performed by\r\nany of the mail packets. Captain Chappell, R.N., afterwards took her clear\r\nround England and Scotland, calling at numerous ports. The Admiralty at\r\nlength ordered the construction of a screw vessel, and the lines of the\r\n_Rattler_ were laid down on the same model as the _Alecto_, a paddle-wheel\r\nsteamer then building.\r\n\r\nAnother claimant as an inventor, who should be mentioned most honourably,\r\nis Mr. Woodcroft, some of whose experiments were being patented in 1826.\r\nThey were not tried on a suitable scale till after the successes of\r\nEricsson and Smith. Woodcroft’s “varying pitch screw-propeller,” patented\r\nin 1844, the title of which describes itself, is to-day “considered the\r\nbest and most useful type.”\r\n\r\nIn following the progress of the screw, as applicable to the propulsion of\r\nmerchant vessels,(32) and its use in other countries, we must now recur to\r\nthe period when Ericsson was making his experiments on the Thames. At that\r\ntime an intelligent gentleman, Captain Robert F. Stockton, of the United\r\nStates’ Navy, was on a visit to London; being of an inquisitive turn of\r\nmind, like most of his countrymen, he watched with great interest the\r\ntrials with the screw then in progress, and having obtained an\r\nintroduction to Ericsson, he accompanied him on one of his experimental\r\nexpeditions on the Thames. Unlike the Lords of the British Admiralty, who\r\nallowed eight years to elapse before they built their first\r\nscrew-propeller, the _Rattler_, Captain Stockton was so impressed with the\r\nvalue and utility of the discovery, that, although he had only made a\r\nsingle trip in the _Francis B. Ogden_, and that merely from London Bridge\r\nto Greenwich, he there and then gave Ericsson a commission to build for\r\nhim two boats for the United States, with steam machinery and propeller as\r\nproposed by him. Stockton, impressed with its practical utility for war\r\npurposes, was undismayed by the recorded opinions of scientific men, and\r\nformed his own judgment from what he himself witnessed. He, therefore, not\r\nonly ordered the two iron boats on his own account, but at once brought\r\nthe subject before the Government of the United States, and caused various\r\nplans and models to be made at his own expense, explaining the fitness of\r\nthe new invention for ships of war. So sanguine was he, indeed, of the\r\ngreat importance of this new mode of propulsion, and so determined that\r\nhis views should be carried out, that he encouraged Ericsson to believe\r\nthat the Government of the United States would test his propeller on a\r\nlarge scale; Ericsson, relying upon these promises, abandoned his\r\nprofessional engagements in England, and took his departure for the United\r\nStates. But it was not until a change in the Federal administration, two\r\nyears afterwards, that Captain Stockton was able to obtain a favourable\r\nhearing. Orders were then given to make an experiment in the _Princeton_,\r\nwhich was successful. The propeller, as applied to this war vessel, was\r\nsimilar in construction to that of the _Francis B. Ogden_, as well in\r\ntheory as in minute practical details. One of the boats, named after her\r\nowner, the _Robert F. Stockton_, was built by Messrs. Laird, of\r\nBirkenhead, and launched in 1838. She was 70 feet in length, 10 feet wide,\r\nand drew 6 feet 9 inches of water. Her cylinders were 16 inches diameter\r\nwith 18 inches stroke, and her propellers 6 feet 4 inches in length. On\r\nher trial trip on the Thames, made in January of the following year, she\r\naccomplished a distance of nine miles in about half an hour with the tide,\r\nproving the speed through the water to be between eleven and twelve miles\r\nan hour. On her second trial, between Southwark and Waterloo Bridges, she\r\ntook in tow four laden barges with upright sides and square ends, having a\r\nbeam of fifteen feet each, and drawing four feet six inches of water. One\r\nof these was lashed on each side, the other two being towed astern, and\r\nthough the weight of the whole must have been close upon 400 tons, and a\r\nconsiderable resistance was offered by their forms, the steamer towed them\r\nat the rate of 5½ miles an hour in slack water, or in eleven minutes\r\nbetween the two bridges, a distance of one mile.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: THE “ROBERT F. STOCKTON.”]\r\n\r\nThese experiments having been considered in every way satisfactory, the\r\n_Robert F. Stockton_ left England for the United States in the beginning\r\nof April, 1839, under the command of Captain Cram of the American merchant\r\nservice. Her crew consisted of four men and a boy; and having accomplished\r\nthe voyage _under sail_ in forty days, Captain Cram was presented with the\r\nfreedom of the city of New York for his daring in crossing the Atlantic in\r\nso small a craft, constructed only for river navigation.\r\n\r\nThe first steamer to cross the Atlantic was the _Savannah_, of 300 tons,\r\nwhich arrived in Liverpool from Savannah, Georgia, in thirty-one days, her\r\nvoyage having been made partly under sail. So to America belongs the\r\ncredit of having shown the practicability of employing steam power for the\r\nmost difficult and dangerous voyages. The _Savannah’s_ horse-power was too\r\nsmall for her size, and although she arrived safely, the experiment was\r\nnot regarded by men of science as particularly successful. Dr. Lardner in\r\nparticular, and other scientists, expressed their belief that no vessel\r\ncould carry coal enough to steam the whole distance, and their discussions\r\ngreatly retarded the progress of Transatlantic steam navigation. The\r\nvoyage of the _Savannah_ was made in 1819; ten years elapsed before the\r\nAtlantic traffic was renewed, so far as steam was concerned, by the\r\ndispatch of an English-built steam-ship, the _Curaçoa_, which made several\r\ntrips from Holland to the West Indies. In 1833 a steam-ship, named the\r\n_Royal William_, sailed from Quebec, and arrived safely at Gravesend. But\r\nit was not till 1838 that the practicability of profitably employing\r\nsteam-ships on the Atlantic was demonstrated by the voyages of the\r\n_Sirius_ and _Great Western_, the latter one of the finest vessels of the\r\nday. Their arrival at New York is thus described by one of the journals of\r\nthat city:—\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: ARRIVAL OF THE “GREAT WESTERN” AT NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\n“At three o’clock p.m., on Sunday the 22nd of April, the _Sirius_ first\r\ndescried the land, and early on Monday morning, the 23rd, anchored in the\r\nNorth River immediately off the battery. The moment the intelligence was\r\nmade known, hundreds and thousands rushed, early in the morning, to the\r\nbattery. Nothing could exceed the excitement. The river was covered during\r\nthe whole day with row-boats, skiffs, and yawls, carrying the wondering\r\npeople out to get a close view of this extraordinary vessel. While people\r\nwere yet wondering how the _Sirius_ made out to cross the rude Atlantic,\r\nit was announced, about eleven a.m. on Monday, from the telegraph, that a\r\nhuge steam-ship was in the offing. ‘_The Great Western! The Great\r\nWestern!_’ was on everybody’s tongue. About two o’clock p.m., the first\r\ncurl of her ascending smoke fell on the eyes of the thousands of anxious\r\nspectators. A shout of enthusiasm rose in the air.” The movements of a\r\ngreat steam-ship in and out of port are always watched with interest—why,\r\neven the arrival of the “husbands’ boat” at Margate or Ramsgate is an\r\nevent! One can, then, well imagine and understand the excitement caused in\r\nNew York by the arrival of two fine vessels almost simultaneously from\r\nEngland. It meant, in some branches of commerce, a complete revolution.\r\nThese first passages were made in seventeen and fifteen days respectively.\r\nAlmost immediately after this, the great Cunard Company commenced\r\noperations, the Admiralty awarding them the mail contract. Then came the\r\ngreat contest for the maritime supremacy, commercially regarded, of the\r\nAtlantic Ocean, when American enterprise came into the field, and\r\norganised a formidable rival to the English company in the Collins Line.\r\nThe history of this contest would fill a volume.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: THE FIRST CUNARD STEAMER.]\r\n\r\nThe national pride of the Americans had been touched by the commercial\r\nsuccess of British steam-ships frequenting their ports, and they\r\ndetermined, vulgarly speaking, “to have a piece of the pie.” American\r\ngenius and enterprise had sent forth a fleet of steamers to trade on their\r\ncoasts, lakes, and rivers, which a leading English authority considers\r\n“were marvels of naval architecture, unsurpassed in speed, and in the\r\nsplendour of their equipment.” Their clipper-sailing ships “were the\r\nfinest the world had then produced, while their perfection in the art of\r\nship-building had even reached so high a point that they constructed\r\nsteamers to ascend rivers where there was hardly depth of water for an\r\nIndian canoe; indeed, it was proverbially said, in honour of their skill\r\nin the art, that their vessels would traverse valleys if only moistened by\r\nthe morning dews.” Why should they not have a great ocean line? It was\r\nlooked upon in Congress and by the country generally as almost a national\r\nquestion, and it resulted in a heavy mail subsidy to Mr. Collins and his\r\ncolleagues. They immediately made arrangements for the construction of\r\nfour large vessels. Later, the Government increased the subsidy by over\r\none-third (from $19,250 per trip to $33,000) _but increased speed was\r\nrequired in return_. How much this may have had to do with the two\r\nterrible disasters about to be related will no doubt strike the reader.\r\nThe Collins Line commenced its voyages in 1850.\r\n\r\n“A voyage across the Atlantic,” says Lindsay, “must ever be attended with\r\ngreater peril than almost any other ocean service of similar length and\r\nduration; arising, as this does, from the boisterous character and\r\nuncertainty of the weather, from the icebergs which float in huge masses\r\nduring spring along the northern line of passage, and from the many\r\nvessels of every kind to be met with either employed in the Newfoundland\r\nfisheries, or in the vast and daily-increasing intercourse between Europe\r\nand America.\r\n\r\n“In such a navigation the utmost care requires to be constantly exercised,\r\nespecially by steam-ships. Nevertheless, although the Collins Line of\r\nsteamers performed this passage with a speed hitherto unequalled, they\r\nencountered no accidents worthy of notice during the first four years of\r\ntheir career; but terrible calamities befell them soon afterwards.”\r\n\r\nOn the 21st of September, 1854, the _Arctic_, according to the usual\r\ncourse, left Liverpool for New York. She had on board 233 passengers, of\r\nwhom 150 were first-class, together with a crew of 135 persons and a\r\nvaluable cargo. At mid-day on the 27th of that month, when about sixty\r\nmiles south-east of Cape Race, and during a dense fog, she came in contact\r\nwith the French steamer _Vesta_. By this collision the _Vesta_ seemed at\r\nfirst to be so seriously injured, that in their terror and confusion, her\r\npassengers, amounting to 147, and a crew of fifty men, conceived she was\r\nabout to sink, and that their only chance of safety lay in their getting\r\nquickly into the _Arctic_. Impressed with this idea many of them rushed\r\ninto the boats, of which, as too frequently happens, one sank immediately,\r\nand the other, containing thirteen persons, was swamped under the quarter\r\nof the ship, all on board of her perishing. When, however, the captain of\r\nthe _Vesta_ more carefully examined his injuries, he found that though the\r\nbows of his vessel were partially stove in, the foremost bulk-head had not\r\nstarted. He therefore at once lightened his ship by the head,\r\nstrengthening the partition by every means in his power, and by great\r\nexertions, courage, forethought, and seamanship, brought his shattered\r\nvessel, without further loss, into the harbour of St. John’s.\r\n\r\nIn the meantime a frightful catastrophe befell the _Arctic_, and was so\r\nlittle anticipated that the persons on board of her supposing that she had\r\nonly sustained a slight injury by the collision, had launched a boat for\r\nthe rescue of the passengers and crew of the _Vesta_. It was soon,\r\nhowever, discovered that their own ship had sustained fatal injuries, and\r\nthe sea was rushing in so fast through three holes which had been pierced\r\nin the hull below the water-line, that the engine fires would soon be\r\nextinguished. The _Arctic’s_ head was therefore immediately laid for Cape\r\nRace, the nearest point of land; but within four hours of the collision\r\nthe water reached the furnaces, and soon afterwards she foundered. As it\r\nwas blowing a strong gale at the time, some of the boats into which the\r\npassengers and crew rushed were destroyed in launching; others which got\r\nclear of the sinking ship were never again heard of, and only two, with\r\nthirty-one of the crew and fourteen passengers, reached Newfoundland.\r\nAmong those who perished were the wife of Mr. Collins, and their son and\r\ndaughter; but the captain, who remained on board to the last, and the\r\nfirst as well as the second and fourth officers, were saved. Seventy-two\r\nmen and four females sought refuge on a raft, which the seamen, when they\r\nfound the ship sinking, had hastily constructed; but one by one they were\r\nswept away—every wave as it washed over the raft claiming one or more\r\nvictims as its prey; and at eight o’clock on the following morning _one_\r\nhuman being alone was left out of the seventy-six persons, who only twelve\r\nor fifteen hours before had hoped to save their lives on this temporary\r\nstructure. The solitary occupant of this fragile raft must have had a\r\nbrave heart and a strong nerve to have retained his place on it for a day\r\nand a half after all his companions had perished, for it was not until\r\nthat time had elapsed that he was saved by a passing vessel. His tale of\r\nhow he and they parted was of the most heart-rending description.(33)\r\n\r\nAs a large portion of the first-class passengers of the _Arctic_ consisted\r\nof persons of wealth and extensive commercial relations in the United\r\nStates, as well as in England and the colonies, and besides more than one\r\nmember of her aristocracy, the loss of the _Arctic_, and the terrible\r\nincidents in connection with her fate, caused an unusual amount of grief\r\nand consternation on both sides of the Atlantic.\r\n\r\nWithin little more than twelve months from this time another great\r\ncalamity befell the Collins Company, and the sad loss of their steamer\r\n_Pacific_—from the mystery in which it was shrouded, if not as lamentable\r\nas that of the _Arctic_ (for the soul of man has never been harrowed with\r\nits details)—was equally deplorable. Although the ocean in this instance\r\nhas left no record of its ravages, the stern fact announced in the brief\r\nwords, “_she was never heard of_,” tells itself the sad, sad tale that a\r\ngreat ship, with all her living inmates, in infancy, in manhood and old\r\nage, and it may be full of hope and joy, had been engulfed in the blue\r\nwaters of the Atlantic—summoned, perhaps in a moment, to an eternity more\r\nmysterious than that which surrounded their melancholy fate.\r\n\r\nThe splendid but unfortunate ship left Liverpool on the 23rd of January,\r\n1856, having on board twenty-five first-class passengers, twenty\r\nsecond-class passengers, and a crew of 141 persons, almost all of whom\r\nwere Americans. She carried the mails and a valuable cargo, the insurances\r\neffected on her being 2,000,000 dollars. But no living soul ever returned\r\nto tell where or how she was lost, nor were any articles belonging to her\r\never found to afford a clue to her melancholy fate; it can only be\r\nsupposed that she sprang an overflowing leak, or more probably struck\r\nsuddenly when at full speed on an iceberg, and instantly foundered.\r\n\r\nThe Collins Line ceased to exist a few years after these serious\r\ndisasters, but the Cunard became more firmly established than ever, and\r\nentered on that career of prosperity which has been the most remarkable of\r\nany in the long list of steam-ship lines. Its fleet consisted of\r\nforty-nine vessels in 1875, running not merely on the Atlantic service,\r\nbut to Mediterranean and other ports. A competent authority puts the money\r\nvalue of the ships at about seven millions sterling. In the ocean line the\r\ncrews are engaged for a single voyage out and home. The company shipped\r\nand discharged during the year ending July 1st, 1872, 43,000 men, which\r\nmeans that they continuously employed about 8,600 persons on their ships.\r\nAbout 1,500 men find regular employment in loading and unloading the\r\nsteam-ships, and from 500 to 1,500 more are engaged at the docks of the\r\ncompany in Liverpool in fitting and refitting these vessels. “Hence the\r\ncompany, although a private enterprise in the hands of only three\r\nfamilies, is entitled to rank with the great railway and other public\r\ncompanies as an employer of labour.”(34) The Cunard Company, in 1861,\r\nenrolled a regiment of Volunteer Artillery (the 11th Lancashire) 500\r\nstrong, composed entirely of their own _employés_, and they have always\r\nshown much public spirit in Liverpool in the promotion of schools,\r\nasylums, and other provident and charitable institutions for the seamen’s\r\nbenefit. During the Crimean war, and in 1861, when the friendly relations\r\nbetween Great Britain and America were put in jeopardy by the forcible\r\narrest of Messrs. Mason and Slidell, when on board the Royal Mail steamer\r\n_Trent_, the resources of the company were put into requisition for the\r\nconveyance of troops and stores. Their two largest ships, the _Bothnia_\r\nand _Scythia_, each of 4,535 tons burden, have saloons where 300 persons\r\ncan dine at one time, while their decks afford an unbroken promenade, for\r\npassengers, of 425 feet.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: THE CUNARD SCREW STEAM-SHIP “BOTHNIA.”]\r\n\r\nThe wonderful exemption from shipwreck and casualties, which is the just\r\npride of this company, is due to the admirable discipline and order\r\nenforced. Take the following description of life on the _Bothnia_ as\r\ndetailed in the columns of our leading journal:—“The _Bothnia_ carries ten\r\nboats, which are capable of containing her full complement of people; and\r\nshe has a crew of 150 officers and men, all told, divided into the three\r\nclasses of seamen, engineers and firemen, and stewards. It has always been\r\npart of the Cunard Company’s system that every man, whatever his duties on\r\nboard the ship, should be a member of some particular boat’s crew, and\r\nthat the crew of each boat should be formed from all three of the classes\r\nwhich have been mentioned.... As soon as all are on board, each man is\r\ninformed to which boat he is attached, and who is the commanding officer\r\nof that boat, and each boat’s officer is expected to know every member of\r\nhis boat’s crew. In order to prevent mistakes, each man wears a metal\r\nbadge, with a brooch-fastening, which bears the number of his boat,” and\r\nso forth. Before the passengers are on board, there is an inspection, the\r\ncrew being drawn up in two lines, each man being expected to answer to his\r\nname. The muster-roll having been called, orders are given to prepare for\r\nboat service; and the men break up into the necessary number of crews.\r\nAfter the order “Boats out!” is given, the men fall to work with a will,\r\nand the ten boats, each containing a keg of water, oars, spars, sails, an\r\naxe, &c., are in three minutes properly launched into the water, the\r\ncaptain from his place of vantage on the bridge looking sharply after\r\nlaziness or awkwardness. The same organisation of crews is applied to fire\r\nduty. Some have charge of the buckets; others fetch and join the hose, or\r\ntake care of the jets; others are ready with wet blankets to throw over\r\nthe flames; but the essential matter is that each man has his place and\r\nhis duty. So for manning the pumps and other essential matters. These\r\ndrills over, the inspecting party proceeds to make a complete tour of the\r\nvessel. The store-rooms are visited, and the steward cautioned never to\r\nuse any other light than a closed and locked lamp. The supply of rockets\r\nand other signals is examined, the steering and signalling apparatus\r\ntried, and only after everything has been found in order is the word given\r\nfor the ship to embark her passengers and proceed on her course. “If the\r\nsmallest defect,” says the _Times_, before quoted, “is discovered in any\r\npart of a ship, no question is raised whether it will bear one voyage or\r\ntwo voyages more, but the order, ‘Out with it!’ is given at once.” The\r\nreign of order is as complete as on board a well-regulated man-of-war. On\r\nthe many other great steam-ship lines more or less of the same inspection\r\noccurs, and on some, no doubt, the precautions taken are nearly as\r\ncareful. The Cunard Line is generally admitted to be, however, pre-eminent\r\nin the care taken of life and property on board, the fact being that the\r\ncompany has never lost a ship on the Atlantic. The illustration on page\r\n109 shows one of their finest ships, the _Scotia_.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: CUNARD PADDLE STEAM-SHIP “SCOTIA.”]\r\n\r\nFrom the Mersey alone there are ten distinct fleets sailing to America,\r\nincluding such magnificent steam-ships as those of the White Star and\r\nInman Lines. In the former the luxurious saloons are placed amidships, the\r\nmotion being less felt there. The Inman Line has made the quickest\r\npassages across the Atlantic on record, and has carried as many as 50,000\r\nsteerage passengers in one year. In 1856 and 1857 this line carried 85,000\r\npassengers, of both classes, to and from the United States, or about\r\none-third of all those crossing “the Great Ferry” for those years. The\r\nshortness of time to which the Inman steamers have reduced the passage\r\nacross the Atlantic was conspicuously shown by the voyage of Prince Arthur\r\nin 1869, who attended service at Queenstown on the Sunday morning of his\r\ndeparture, and was landed at Halifax in time to attend morning service at\r\nthat place on the Sunday following. Their ship, the _City of Berlin_, of\r\n5,500 tons, is the largest vessel afloat except the _Great Eastern_, and\r\nhas accommodation for 1,700 passengers. The White Star Line has two\r\nvessels of 5,004 tons each, the _Britannic_ and _Germanic_. These few\r\nfacts will indicate—although we may not be able to grasp them in their\r\nentirety—the immense growth of the ocean steam navigation in a period so\r\nshort as that which has elapsed from the first steam-voyage across the\r\nAtlantic.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: MR. PLIMSOLL.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE HISTORY OF SHIPS AND SHIPPING INTERESTS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n      A Contrast—Floating Palaces and “Coffin-ships”—Mr. Plimsoll’s\r\n         Appeal—His Philanthropic Efforts—Use of Old Charts—Badly\r\n       Constructed Ships—A Doomed Ship—Owner’s Gains by her Loss—A\r\n      Sensible Deserter—Overloading—The Widows and Fatherless—Other\r\n      Risks of the Sailor’s Life—Scurvy—Improper Cargoes—“Unclassed\r\n                   Vessels”—“Lloyd’s,” and its History.\r\n\r\n\r\nTurning by way of that contrast which our subject so abundantly presents,\r\nlet us pass from the consideration of well-regulated, well-found\r\nsteam-ship lines, to a different class of vessels—those “coffin-ships” of\r\nwhich we heard so much a few years since. As we all know, the term has\r\nbeen lately used to signify unseaworthy ships of all kinds—such as that\r\nmentioned by Mr. Plimsoll, which was loaded at Newcastle with nearly twice\r\nher proper tonnage, and dispatched to the Baltic in mid-winter, _with her\r\nmain-deck two feet two inches below the level of the water_. She foundered\r\neighteen miles from the coast. We are told of one man who had in six years\r\nlost twelve rotten ships, and 105 men; and of the _Elizabeth_, a vessel so\r\nweak and leaky, that it was necessary to pump her every hour when floating\r\nempty in harbour, but which was sent to sea with 180 tons of coal to\r\nfounder with three out of five hands. It was certainly time for\r\nlegislation when the statement could be made truly that a ship which had\r\nbeen refused a class by Lloyd’s Committee, and had been declared utterly\r\nunfit to go to sea by Lloyd’s surveyor, was dispatched across the\r\nAtlantic, or rather to the bottom of the Atlantic, there to lie with one\r\ncrew, while another was safe in an English prison for refusing to proceed\r\nin her.\r\n\r\nIn 1870, Mr. Samuel Plimsoll first commenced, so far as Parliament is\r\nconcerned, those benevolent efforts for the amelioration of the sailor’s\r\nhard life, which must always place him among the highest ranks of\r\nphilanthropists. Moved evidently by the purest motives, there are one or\r\ntwo mistakes to be recorded against him, but they were of the head, not of\r\nthe heart. Government was at the time endeavouring, as far as can be seen,\r\nto accomplish nearly the same ends, but was hampered by the pressure of\r\nParliamentary business. Lindsay, who was somewhat opposed to the views\r\nexpressed by Plimsoll, and it is rather unfortunate that he was so, having\r\nbeen so long a ship-owner himself, yet endorses the remarks of a friend—a\r\nVice-Admiral of Her Majesty’s service—who wrote to him: “Should there not\r\nbe some more stringent provisions with respect to the inspection of\r\nsailing vessels? It is an old proverb, ‘Who ever saw a dead donkey?’ But\r\nwho ever saw an old sailing-ship broken up? I am inclined to think that it\r\nis more to the interest of small owners to let an old tub go on shore than\r\nto bring her safe into port. This works two evils:—1, the danger to human\r\nlife; 2, the greater rate of insurance on honest owners to make up an\r\naverage for the dishonest.” The evil had become a most terrible one, and,\r\nin spite of some little reform, it is to be feared, goes on to-day with\r\nonly partially-abated vigour.\r\n\r\n“Imperfect charts,” says Lindsay, “were often made to cover, as I fear may\r\nbe the case to some extent now, incompetency, drunkenness, or\r\ncarelessness. Indeed, about that period, they frequently served as excuses\r\nwhen other objects were in view. I remember a ludicrous example of this.\r\nWhen a boy at school at Ayr, I used to accompany my uncle to ‘the meeting\r\nof owners’ of the brig _Eclipse_, in which he held some eight or ten 64th\r\nshares. Every spring the owners met on board to discuss matters relating\r\nto her affairs, and to dispose of what I recollect best, a round of salt\r\nbeef, sea-biscuits, and rum and water. The _Eclipse_ had hitherto been\r\ninvariably employed during the summer season in the conveyance of timber\r\nfrom some one or other of the ports of New Brunswick for Ayr. On one\r\noccasion, a tempting freight had been offered for her to proceed to\r\nQuebec, and the owners in conclave assembled, had all but unanimously\r\ndecided to send her to that port. While, however, the discussion was going\r\non, her skipper, Garratt, or, ‘old Garratty,’ as he was called, seemed\r\nvery uneasy, and gulping down an extra tumbler of rum and water, he at\r\nlast said, ‘Weel, gentlemen, should you send the _Eclipse_ to Quebec, I’ll\r\nnot be answerable for her safety.’ ‘How so?’ asked one of the owners.\r\n‘Ah,’ said Garratty, drawing his breath, ‘_the charts are a’wrang in the\r\nSt. Lawrence_. Ye’ll ne’er see the _Eclipse_ again gin ye send her to\r\nQuebec.’ The skipper carried the day.\r\n\r\n“It is much to be regretted that ship-owners, when they leave their\r\ncaptains to provide their own charts (instead of supplying them) do not\r\nstipulate that they are to be the best and the _latest_. I remember a ship\r\nand cargo (numerous other instances could be produced), valued at £70,000,\r\nlost near Boulogne from the master mistaking the two lights at Etaples for\r\nthe South Foreland lights; and this, as appeared from the Board of Trade\r\ninquiry, because his Channel chart, which was thirty years old, had not\r\nthe Etaples lights marked on it.” The terrible wreck of the _Deutschland_\r\nsteam-ship, on the 30th December, 1875, was caused, with hardly the shadow\r\nof a doubt, from the use of an old chart.\r\n\r\nMr. Plimsoll in a most remarkable and vigorous book,(35) published in\r\n1873, puts the matter of “coffin-ships” forcibly before his readers. He\r\nsays, “No means are neglected by Parliament to provide for the safety of\r\nlife ashore; and yet, as I said before, you may build a ship in any way\r\nyou please, you may use timber utterly unfit, you may use it in quantity\r\nutterly inadequate, but no one has any authority to interfere with you.\r\n\r\n“You may even buy an old ship 250 tons burden by auction for £50, sold to\r\nbe broken up, because extremely old and rotten; she had had a narrow\r\nescape on her last voyage, and had suffered so severely that she was quite\r\nunfit to go to sea again without more being spent in repairs upon her than\r\nshe would be worth when done. Instead of breaking up this old ship, bought\r\nfor 4s. per ton (the cost of a new ship being from £10 to £14 per ton), as\r\nwas expected, you may give her a coat of paint—she is too rotten for\r\ncaulking—and to the dismay of her late owners, you may prepare to send her\r\nto sea. You may be remonstrated with, in the strongest terms, against\r\ndoing so, even to being told that if you persist, and the men are lost,\r\nyou deserve to be tried for manslaughter.\r\n\r\n“You may engage men in another port, and they, having signed articles\r\nwithout seeing the ship, you may send them to the port where the ship lies\r\nin the custody of a mariner. You may then (after re-christening the ship,\r\nwhich ought not to be allowed), if you have managed to insure her heavily,\r\nload her until the main deck is within two feet of the water amidships,\r\nand send her to sea. Nobody can prevent you. Nay, more, if the men become\r\nriotous, you may arrest them without a magistrate’s warrant, and take them\r\nto prison, and the magistrates, who have no choice (they have not to make,\r\nbut only to administer the law), will commit them to prison for twelve\r\nweeks with hard labour, or, better still for you, you may send for a\r\npoliceman on board to overawe the mutineers, and induce them to do their\r\nduty! And then, if the ship is lost with all hands, you will gain a large\r\nsum of money and you will be asked no questions, as no inquiry will ever\r\nbe held over those unfortunate men, unless (which has only happened once,\r\nI think) some member of the House asks for inquiry.\r\n\r\n“The river policeman who in one case threatened a refractory crew with\r\nimprisonment, and urged them to do their duty (!) told me afterwards (when\r\nthey were all drowned) that he and his colleagues at the river-side\r\nstation had spoken to each other about the ship being dreadfully\r\noverloaded as she passed their station on the river, before he went on\r\nboard to urge duty (!) and that he then, when he saw me, ‘rued badly that\r\nhe had not locked ’em up without talk, as then they wouldn’t have been\r\ndrowned.’”\r\n\r\nHere Mr. Plimsoll indicates another risk for the poor sailor: “There is, I\r\nfear, great reason to think that ships are occasionally lost from the very\r\nimperfect manner in which some of them are built; in some cases, I think\r\nyou will see that something worse ought to be said. I do not say the cases\r\nare many; still, they exist, and we have done nothing to prevent it. The\r\nfirst time I introduced a bill to prevent overloading, I alluded\r\n(mentioning no names) to the case of one ship-owner who, trading to the\r\nWest Indies for sugar (a good voyage, deep water, and plenty of sea room\r\nall the way) had, out of a fleet of twenty-one vessels, lost no less than\r\nten of them in less than three years.\r\n\r\n“After I had concluded my speech in moving the second reading, a member\r\naccosted me in the lobby and said: ‘Mr. Plimsoll, you were mistaken in\r\nthat statement of yours.’ ‘What statement?’ I answered. ‘Oh, that when you\r\nsaid a ship-owner had lost ten ships in less than three years from\r\noverloading.’ ‘I mentioned no names,’ I said. ‘No, but I know who you\r\nmeant. He is one of my constituents, and a very respectable man indeed. It\r\nis not his fault; it is the fault of the man who built his ships, for one\r\nof them was surveyed in London and was found to be put together with\r\ndevils. He knew nothing about it, I assure you.’ ‘Devils?’ I said. ‘Yes.’\r\n‘I don’t know what you mean.’ ‘Oh, devils are sham bolts, you know; that\r\nis, when they ought to be copper, the head and about an inch of the shaft\r\nare copper, and the rest is iron.’\r\n\r\n“I have since found there are other and different sham bolts used, where\r\nmerely a bolthead (without any shaft at all) is driven in, and only as\r\nmany real bolts used as will keep the timbers in their places. Now these\r\nbolts are used to go through the outside planking, the upright timber, not\r\nthe inner planking (ceiling) of a ship, and through the vertical or\r\ndrooping part of a piece of iron called a knee, on the upper part of which\r\nthe deck-beams rest, and to which the deck-beams are also bolted from\r\nabove. These bolts, therefore, are from thirteen to eighteen inches in\r\nlength.”\r\n\r\nThe following examples will speak for themselves. Mr. Plimsoll says:—“On\r\nthe occasion of one of my visits to a port in the north, I was met by a\r\ngentleman who knew what my errand there was likely to be, and he said,\r\n‘Oh, Mr. Plimsoll, you should have been here yesterday: a vessel went down\r\nthe river so deeply loaded, that everybody who saw her expects to hear of\r\nher being lost. She was loaded under the personal directions of her owner,\r\nand the captain himself said to me, “Isn’t it shameful to send men with\r\nfamilies to sea in a vessel loaded like that?” Poor fellow, it is much if\r\never he reaches port.’ Half a dozen others confirmed this statement. The\r\ncaptain ‘was greatly depressed in spirits,’ and a friend—not the owner,\r\nmark you!—gave him some rockets—‘in case of the worst.’ Two men averred\r\nthat they would not go if the owner gave them the ship.\r\n\r\n“She was sent. The men were some of them threatened, and one at least had\r\na promise of 10s. extra per month if he would go. As she went away, the\r\npolice-boat left her; the police had been on board to overawe the men with\r\ngoing. As the police-boat left her side, two of the men, deciding that\r\nthey would rather be taken to prison, hailed the police, and begged to be\r\ntaken by them. The police said, ‘they could not interfere,’ and the ship\r\nsailed. My friend was in great anxiety, and told me that if the wind came\r\non to blow, the _ship could not live_.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: MR. PLIMSOLL SPEAKING IN THE HOUSE OF COMMONS.]\r\n\r\n“It did blow a good half-gale all the day after Sunday—the ship sailed on\r\nFriday. I was looking seaward from the promontory on which the ruins of\r\nT—— Castle stand, with a heavy heart; the wind was not above force\r\n7—nothing to hurt a well-found and properly-loaded vessel: I had often\r\nbeen out in much worse weather; but then this vessel was not properly\r\nloaded (and her owner stood to gain over £2,000 clear if she went down, by\r\nover insurance), and I knew that there were many others almost as unfit as\r\nshe was to encounter rough weather—ships so rotten that if they struck\r\nthey would go to pieces at once; ships so overloaded that every sea would\r\nmake a clean sweep over her, sending tons and tons of water into her hold\r\nevery time, until the end came.\r\n\r\n“On Monday we heard of a ship in distress having been seen, rockets had\r\nbeen sent up by her; it was feared she was lost. On Tuesday the nameboard\r\nof a boat was picked up, and this was all that ever we heard of her.”\r\n\r\nSome cases seemed to be looked on as matters of course, and a gentleman as\r\nhe saw his wife reading the newspaper, said to her, “Look out, for the ——\r\nin a day or two; I saw her go out of the river. She is sure to be lost.”\r\nShe was lost, and nearly twenty men returned home never more.\r\n\r\nMr. Plimsoll tells another story of two gentlemen, who told him one day\r\nthat they saw a vessel leaving dock; she was so deep that, having a list\r\nupon her, the scuppers on the bow side were half in the water and half\r\nout. (A “list” means that she was so loaded as to have one side rather\r\ndeeper down than the other; the “scuppers” are the holes in the bulwarks\r\nthat let the water out that comes on deck from the rain, the washing, or\r\nthe seas breaking over her.) They heard a slight commotion on board, and a\r\nvoice said to the captain: “Larry’s not on board, sir.” He had run for it.\r\nNothing could be done, for lack of time, to seek him, so they sailed\r\nwithout him. And these gentlemen heard the crew say, as they slowly moved\r\naway from the dockyard: “Then Larry’s the only man of us’ll be alive in a\r\nweek.” That vessel was lost.\r\n\r\nAnother large ship was sailing on a long voyage, from a port in Wales,\r\nwith a cargo of coal. A gentleman called a friend’s attention to her\r\nstate. She was a good ship, but terribly deep in the water. He said, “Now,\r\nis it possible that vessel _can_ reach her destination unless the sea is\r\nas smooth as a mill-pond the whole way?” The sea evidently was not as\r\nsmooth as a mill-pond, for that ship was never heard of again, and\r\ntwenty-eight of our poor, hard-working, brave fellow-subjects never more\r\nreturned to gladden their wives and play with their children.\r\n\r\nMr. Plimsoll saw a large ship put to sea one day. She was so deep that a\r\nfriend who was standing by said to him as she went: “She is nothing but a\r\ncoffin for the poor fellows on board of her.” He watched and watched,\r\nalmost fascinated by the deadly peril of the crew, and he did not watch\r\nfor nothing. Before he left his look-out to go home, he saw her go down.\r\n\r\nEven more touching are the records of some visits made by him to the\r\nsufferers left behind to mourn the fate of their husbands, drowned in\r\nleaky ships which should never have left port.\r\n\r\n“In this house, No. 9, L——ll Street, lives Mrs. A——r R——e. Look at her—she\r\nis not more than two or three and twenty, and those little ones are hers.\r\nShe has a mangle, you see. It was subscribed for her by her poor\r\nneighbours: the poor are very kind to each other. That poor little fellow\r\nhas hurt his foot, and looks wonderingly at the face of his young mother.\r\nShe had a loving husband but very lately, but the owner of the ship on\r\nwhich he served, the _S——n_, was a very needy man, who insured her for\r\n£3,000 more than she had cost him. So if she sank he would gain all this.\r\nWell, one voyage she was loaded _under the owner’s personal\r\nsuperintendence_; she was loaded so deeply that the dockmaster pointed her\r\nout to a friend as she left the dock, and said emphatically, ‘That ship\r\nwill never reach her destination.’ She never did, for she was lost with\r\nall hands—twenty men and boys. A—— R—— complained to him before he sailed\r\nthat she was ‘so deep loaded.’ She tried to get to the sands to see the\r\nship off with Mrs. J——r, whose husband was on board. They never saw their\r\nhusbands again.\r\n\r\n“In this most evil-smelling room, E—— Q—— C—— Street, you may see in the\r\ncorner two poor women in one bed, stricken with fever (one died two days\r\nafter I saw them), mother and daughter. The husband of the daughter, who\r\nmaintained them both, had been lost at sea a little while before, in a\r\nship so loaded that when Mr. B——l, a Custom House officer who had to go on\r\nboard for some reason while she was lying in the river, was told, ‘She’s\r\nyonder; you can easily find her, she is nearly over t’head in the water,’\r\nMr. B——l told me, ‘I asked no questions, but stepped on board; this\r\ndescription was quite sufficient.’\r\n\r\n“Mrs. R——s, H——n Place, told me her young brother was an orphan with\r\nherself. She said her sister brought him up till she was married. Then her\r\nhusband was kind to him, and apprenticed him to the sea. He had passed as\r\nsecond mate in a sailing ship, but (he was a fine young fellow—I have his\r\nportrait) he was ambitious to ‘pass in steam’ also, and engaged to serve\r\nin the _S——_ ship, leaking badly, but was assured on signing that she was\r\nto be repaired before loading. The ship was not repaired, and was loaded,\r\nas he told his sister-mother, ‘like a sand-barge.’ Was urged by his sister\r\nand her husband not to go. His sister again urged him as he passed her\r\ndoor in the morning. He promised he would not, and went to the ship to get\r\nthe wages due to him. Was refused payment unless he went, was\r\nover-persuaded and threatened, and called a coward, which greatly excited\r\nhim. He went, and two days afterwards the ship went down. Her husband and\r\nMrs. R——s also told me that he and his wife ‘had a bit crack,’ and decided\r\nto do all they could to ‘persuade Johnnie not to go.’ The young man was\r\nabout twenty-two.\r\n\r\n“Mr. J—— H——l told me that the captain was his friend, and the captain was\r\nvery down-hearted about the way in which she was loaded (mind, she was\r\nloaded under the owner’s personal supervision). The captain asked him (Mr.\r\nA——) to see his wife off by train after the ship had sailed. She, poor\r\nsoul, had travelled to that port to see him off. The captain said to him,\r\n‘I doubt I’ll never see her more!’ and burst out crying. Poor fellow, he\r\nnever did see her more.\r\n\r\n“Now come with me to 36, C——, and see Mrs. J——e R——e. She is a young woman\r\nof superior intelligence, and has a trustable face—very. She may be about\r\nseven-and-twenty. She lost her husband in the same ship. He was thirty\r\nyears of age, and, to use her own words, ‘such a happy creature; so full\r\nof jokes.’ He was engaged as second engineer, at £4 10s. and board. ‘After\r\nhis ship was loaded he was a changed man; he got his tea without saying a\r\nword, and then sat looking into the fire in a deep study, like. I asked\r\nhim what ailed him, and he said, more to himself than to me, “She’s such a\r\nbeast!” I thought he meant the men’s place was dirty, as he had complained\r\nbefore that there was no place to wash. He liked to be clean, my husband,\r\nand always had a good wash when he came home from the workshop, when he\r\nworked ashore. So I said, “Will you let me come on board to clean it out\r\nfor you?” And he said, still looking at the fire, “It ain’t that.” Well,\r\nhe hadn’t signed, only agreed, so I said, “Don’t sign, Jim,” and he said\r\nhe wouldn’t, and went and told the engineer he shouldn’t go. The engineer\r\n“spoke so kindly to him,” and offered him 10s. a month more. He had had no\r\nwork for a long time, and the money was tempting,’ she said, ‘and so he\r\nsigned. When he told me I said, “You won’t go, Jim, will you?” He said,\r\n“Why, Minnie, they will put me in gaol if I don’t go.” I said, “Never\r\nmind, you can come home after that.” “But,” said he, “they called me a\r\ncoward, and you would not like to hear me called that.”’\r\n\r\n“The poor woman was crying very bitterly, so I said gently, ‘I hope you\r\nwon’t think I am asking all these questions from idle curiosity;’ and I\r\nshall never forget her quick disclaimer, for she saw that I was troubled\r\nwith her: ‘Oh no, sir; I am glad to answer you, for so many homes might be\r\nkept from being desolate if it was only looked into.’\r\n\r\n“I ascertained that she is ‘getting a bit winning for a livelihood,’ as my\r\ninformant phrased it, by sewing for a ready-made clothes-shopkeeper. She\r\nwas in a small garret with a sloping roof and the most modest fireplace I\r\never saw; just three bits of iron laid from side to side of an opening in\r\nthe brickwork, and two more up the front; no chimney-piece, or jambs, or\r\nstone across the top, but just the bricks laid nearer and nearer until the\r\ncourses united. So I don’t fancy she could be earning much. But with the\r\nvery least money value in the place, it was as beautifully clean as I ever\r\nsaw a room in my life.\r\n\r\n“I also saw a poor woman, who had lost her son aged twenty-two. She too\r\ncried bitterly, as she spoke with _such_ love and pride of her son, and of\r\nthe grief of his father, who was sixty years of age. Her son was taken on\r\nas a stoker, and worked on the ship some days before she was ready for\r\nsea. He did not want to go when he saw how she was loaded. She looked like\r\na floating wreck, but they refused to pay him the money he had earned\r\nunless he went, and he too was lost with the others.\r\n\r\n“Just one more specimen of the good, true, and brave men we sacrifice by\r\nour most cruel and manslaughtering neglect. This time I went and called\r\nupon an old man I knew, and, after apologising for intruding upon his\r\ngrief, I asked him to tell me if he had any objection to tell me if his\r\nson had had any misgiving about the ship before he went. He said, ‘Yes, I\r\nwent to see the ship myself, and was horrified to see the way in which she\r\nwas loaded. I tried all I could to persuade him not to go, but he’d been\r\ndoing nothing for a long time, and he didn’t like being a burden on me.\r\nHe’d a fine sperret, he had, my son,’ said the poor old man.\r\n\r\n“Here a young woman I had not observed (she was in a corner with her face\r\nto the wall) broke out into loud sobs and said, ‘He was the best of us\r\nall, sir—the best of the whole family. He was as fair as a flower, and\r\nvah-y canny-looking.’”\r\n\r\nBut it is not merely rotten hulks which may become coffin-ships: many\r\nsuperior vessels are woefully deficient in accommodation for the sailor’s\r\ncomfort. He may, and often does, wade to his bunk through water, and the\r\nforecastle is too often a miserable hole, full of dirt and filth, where\r\nthe men are packed like herrings. The food provided is principally “salt\r\nhorse” and “hard bread,” _i.e._, sailor’s biscuit of the most inferior\r\ndescription; and when scurvy ensues, as a natural consequence of exposure\r\nto damp and cold, with poor living superadded, the very lime-juice, which\r\nis nearly worthless if not pure, is found to be a miserable imitation or\r\ngrossly adulterated with citric acid, which, strange as it may appear, has\r\nno anti-scorbutic properties. In the Russian and French mercantile marines\r\nthere is little or no scurvy, in consequence of the pretty general use of\r\ncommon sour wine, which in some degree makes up for the lack of fresh\r\nvegetables. And in French mercantile ships the sailor may at any time\r\ndemand the same rations as those served out in the navy of the Republic.\r\nOwing to the carefully prepared dietary of our Royal Navy, scurvy has\r\nentirely disappeared, except in extreme cases of exposure and lack of\r\nprecaution, as in the late Arctic Expedition.(36)\r\n\r\n“In the West India Docks, which contain vessels trading to the West\r\nIndies, I observed a very different class of ships. Some are large and\r\nwell supplied with provisions, but the majority are small, with wretched\r\naccommodation, badly manned, provisions indifferent in quality and\r\ndeficient in quantity. Even in the larger vessels there is not that care\r\ntaken of the men, and that amount of attention paid to their quarters and\r\nto the nature of their provisions, as in the ships belonging to the owners\r\nengaged in the East Indian and China trade. Captain Henry Toynbee strongly\r\nadvocates the better ventilation and comfort of the forecastles, which he\r\nthinks should be under the control of Government. He has himself seen\r\nforecastles and seamen’s chests in first-class ships black from the gas\r\nwhich rises from the cargo, and which smells like sewage, which is\r\nespecially the case in sugar ships. Captain Toynbee informed me a day or\r\ntwo since that he had actually seen a place containing two packs of\r\nfoxhounds and three horses, which received half its ventilation by a hatch\r\nwhich opened into the sailors’ forecastle!...\r\n\r\n“In the Commercial Docks are to be seen both English and foreign ships,\r\nvarying in size and class, most of which are in the timber trade, and have\r\narrived from Norway, Sweden, or Memel, or the Baltic. The number of\r\npatients taken from ships in these docks to the _Dreadnought_ hospital\r\nship usually exceeds that from any other dock; but the cases are those not\r\nof scurvy, but consumption, bronchitis, and other chest diseases, which\r\noccur not so frequently in English sailors as in Norwegians, Swedes, and\r\nRussians—a fact due more, I think, to national predispositions than to\r\nhygienic conditions. In ships belonging to northern countries the\r\nprovisions are abundant and good, the men’s quarters are roomy, and there\r\nis nearly always a house upon deck in which there is a fair amount of\r\nspace and good ventilation. The hygienic condition of the men on board\r\nSwedish and Norwegian ships is far superior to that of the ships of our\r\nown country; the chief fault is the extremely dirty and lazy habit of the\r\nmen themselves, who allow filth of all kinds to accumulate in the\r\ndeck-house and galley, without taking the slightest trouble to remove it.\r\nIn English ships belonging to owners in the timber trade the state of\r\nthings is disgraceful; a house on deck is an exception, and the men live\r\nand sleep in a small, close, ill-ventilated hole called a forecastle. The\r\nquality of provisions varies in different ships, some owners being more\r\nliberal than others; most of the men, however, live upon salt meat and\r\nbiscuit, and sometimes a little salt fish. Timber in itself is considered\r\na healthy cargo, but the ship is in most cases so overladen that the\r\nforecastle is very much reduced in size—too much so, considering the\r\nnumber of men that form the crew; these have either to remain on deck\r\nexposed to wet and cold, or have to breathe the foul atmosphere of a small\r\nforecastle, in which are stowed rusty chains, wet ropes, and all kinds of\r\nanimal decaying matter....”\r\n\r\nThe vessels used for the coal trade are now principally screw steamers,\r\nthough there are still many of the old class, generally found lying\r\nbetween Blackwall and Woolwich. Our authority describes them as\r\nfollows:—They “are of small size (varying from 150 to 600 tons), and are\r\nbuilt as sloops, schooners, or brigs. The majority are brigs; a visit to\r\ntwo or three presents a view of a state of things which is common to all.\r\nA collier brig is generally worked by a captain and a mate, who live in a\r\nsmall dirty cabin, and by four men and a boy, who live and sleep in the\r\nmost miserable of forecastles. This forecastle is very small, and so low\r\nthat no person of ordinary stature can stand upright in it. It is dark,\r\nand the only approach is by a very small hatchway. It generally contains a\r\nquantity of old ropes, some rusty chains, a large tub of grease, and some\r\ndamp canvas. These things, together with three or four dirty hammocks,\r\ntake up the whole space, and it is only from sickness and the most urgent\r\nnecessity that the sailor remains there for any length of time. So old and\r\nill-constructed are some of these colliers, that in rough weather the\r\nforecastle is deluged with water. This condition of things is made much\r\nworse by the negligence of the sailor himself, for it seems to be a rule\r\nthat the cook, instead of throwing over the side of the ship the refuse of\r\nmaterial used for food, as dirty water, potato parings, &c., deposits\r\nthese with great care in some corner of the forecastle. No attention is\r\npaid by the captain to the sanitary state of the ship; during the voyage,\r\nwhich is often a rough one, he is engaged in working the vessel, and while\r\nshe is in harbour he is on shore waiting upon the owners of the vessel, or\r\ntransacting their business in the Coal Exchange. I was informed the other\r\nday by a friend, who was engaged during the recent cholera epidemic as a\r\nsanitary inspector, that a patient afflicted with cholera was taken to the\r\nBelleisle in the month of September, who had been lying in his hammock for\r\ntwo days prostrate, and with much vomiting and purging, and during this\r\ntime the captain, although on board, was not aware of the man’s absence\r\nfrom deck. The provisions supplied in this class of ships vary both in\r\nquality and quantity; the supply, though, is very deficient, and there is\r\nan almost universal complaint among the men and boys that they have not\r\nsufficient to eat. Although coasting voyages last not longer than three or\r\nfour days, and the ship is very seldom far away from land, the men\r\nscarcely ever get fresh meat; the supply always consists of salt beef—the\r\ncoarsest parts of the animal. To this I may add that the biscuits are of\r\nthe worst description, very hard, and are masticated with the greatest\r\ndifficulty. The quality of provisions depends entirely upon the liberality\r\nof the captain, who not unfrequently has a share in the ship, and whose\r\ninterest is consequently concerned in keeping down all expenses; the\r\ncomfort of the men seems to be made subservient to pecuniary advantages.”\r\n\r\nAnd now—for a change—to good owners. There are many, and the present\r\nwriter believes fully that the average ship-owner not merely wishes to\r\npreserve his ship, but all on board—crew, passengers, and cargo. The\r\nproprietor of a grand vessel feels, as he should, that her loss is a very\r\ngreat deal more than his loss. Dr. Stone, some years ago made an\r\ninspection of the docks, and his remarks, published in our leading\r\njournal,(37) deserve to be recorded. He says:—\r\n\r\n“From conversations I had with many of the officers and crews engaged in\r\nGreen’s, Wigram’s, Smith’s, the Black Ball, and other services, and from\r\nwhat I saw, I judged that the provisions are good and ample, and I was\r\ninformed that scurvy is seldom met with in the vessels belonging to these\r\nowners, owing to the fact of the masters not being content with simply\r\nordering the crew to take a certain quantity of lime-juice every day\r\nduring the ship’s voyage, but satisfying themselves by personal inspection\r\nthat the juice is actually drank. Outside the dock gates, and off Plaistow\r\nWharf, may occasionally be seen American vessels which have arrived with\r\npetroleum. An inspection confirmed the opinion I have always entertained\r\nregarding the superior accommodation met with in the vessels of the United\r\nStates; they are large, well manned, and supplied with good provisions.\r\nThe berths and sleeping quarters are better even than those in large East\r\nIndiamen; every ship has a raised house on deck, spacious, well\r\nventilated, and clean, which, being furnished with a stove, the men are\r\nthereby enabled in wet weather to dry their clothes, which is of course a\r\ngreat preservation of their health. The general condition of the men is\r\nfar better than that of the sailor of any other nation. Although the cruel\r\ntreatment exercised by the officers of American ships is proverbial, there\r\nis seldom any difficulty in obtaining a good crew. The masters in the\r\ncommercial marine of America pride themselves upon the general appearance\r\nof their crews, and they say that it is the best economy to give them good\r\nand abundant food, and to pay rigid attention to their sleeping quarters.”\r\n\r\nSometimes it is the cargo itself which is a fatal cause of disease or\r\ndeath. Ships carrying large quantities of minerals, sulphur, petroleum,\r\n&c., sometimes smell intolerably, but are not considered unhealthy places\r\nof residence. But how of guano and other manure ships? In one of Dr.\r\nStone’s letters to the _Times_, published in 1867, he says:—“The most\r\nobjectionable and unhealthy cargoes brought into the Thames are those\r\nconsisting of the different kinds of manure. A large bone trade is carried\r\non in the port of London; barges are constantly passing up and down the\r\nPool laden with bones collected from bone-dealers and the slaughter-houses\r\nof London. Many of the bones are not dry, but are covered with decomposing\r\nflesh. The smell is very bad, and is not limited to the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the barge itself, but may be carried for a long distance.\r\nThese bone barges discharge their cargoes into some small coasting\r\nship.... The sailors and bargemen engaged in work of this kind suffer very\r\nmuch: they are nauseated by the offensive smell; their appetites fail\r\nentirely; they consume large quantities of spirit; and, as a consequence,\r\nare invariably attacked by diarrhœa, accompanied with vomiting. In the\r\nsummer time it is a matter of surprise how anyone can remain, for a short\r\ntime even, in the neighbourhood of the vessel; a thick offensive steam is\r\nconstantly rising from the bones, and the decks and rigging are covered\r\nwith large blue flies. When the vessel (generally a small, very old, and\r\nill-manned schooner) puts to sea, the hatchways are kept open, so as to\r\ngive free egress to the gaseous products of decomposition and to prevent\r\nthe ship from taking fire.”\r\n\r\nMany have been the instances of ships’ decks being blown up by the gas\r\nfrom coal becoming ignited, and loss of life has been caused thereby.\r\nGunpowder may, under certain conditions, become a most dangerous cargo.\r\nTake the case of the _Great Queensland_, which was blown up entirely,\r\nleaving no survivors to tell the tale. The cause is not far to seek when\r\nwe learn that two tons of impure wood powder, sufficient of itself to\r\nburst the ship to pieces, and from its condition likely to explode, were\r\nstored in the same compartment with thirty tons of ordinary black\r\ngunpowder.\r\n\r\nCompulsory survey and no overloading were Mr. Plimsoll’s main remedies for\r\nthe prevention of the terrible loss of life in the mercantile marine. He\r\ncites two cases of great firms—the first engaged in the coal carrying, and\r\nthe second in the guano trade—who do not permit overloading, and the\r\nfirst, in fifteen years had not, out of a large fleet of steamers, lost a\r\nsingle vessel, although they made from fifty to seventy double trips per\r\nannum. And yet the voyage from the Thames to the Tyne is more dangerous\r\nthan an over-sea voyage. There are a whole crowd of dangerous shoals off\r\nthe Essex coast alone, to be avoided or steered between, as the case may\r\nbe, as soon as the ship leaves the Thames, followed by equal dangers on\r\nthe Suffolk and Norfolk coasts. The latter sands are all under water even\r\nwhen the tide is at ebb, but there is not water enough on them to float a\r\nship; hence the losses when ill-found, overloaded, and undermanned vessels\r\nget on them. Further north there are others, and then come the dangerous\r\nrocky coasts of Yorkshire and Durham. The second case deserves particular\r\nmention. About the year 1860, the firm of Anthony Gibbs and Co., of\r\nLondon, took a contract from the Peruvian Government to charter and load\r\nships from the Chincha Islands with guano, and as many as three or four\r\nhundred ships left those islands annually for different parts of the\r\nworld. At first they were allowed to load and proceed to sea without\r\ninspection or surveying, and were permitted to load as deeply as the\r\nmasters thought fit. What was the result? Accidents and losses were\r\nreported every few days, and many of their ships foundered at sea, some\r\nwith all hands on board. When the head of the house at Lima, Peru,\r\nintroduced proper surveying before loading, to discover what repairs were\r\nneeded, &c., allowing no overloading, and not permitting the ships to go\r\nto sea without full inspection of her pumps and gear, a sudden and\r\nwonderful change took place, and for years after not one of these ships\r\nfoundered at sea.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: EXTERIOR OF LLOYD’S.]\r\n\r\nWe often hear and read of “unclassed” ships; does the reader understand\r\nthe term? Nearly all new ships are fit to take valuable merchandise—silks,\r\ntea, provisions, cloth, or what not; and if “tight,” _i.e._, not leaky,\r\nwould be classed A 1 by Lloyd’s Committee. The letter refers to the ship\r\nproper; the numeral to its equipment, rigging, boats, cables, anchors, &c.\r\nThe term or period for which she is classed varies with the quality and\r\nkind of timber employed, and the quality of the workmanship is also taken\r\ninto account. A ship built mainly of hemlock, yellow pine, beech, or fir,\r\nwill generally be classed A 1 for four or five years; of elm or ash five\r\nto seven years; and so on through various grades, until, if built of\r\nEnglish oak or teak, she may be rated nine to twelve years. All are\r\nsubject to the “half-time” survey of a strict character; thus a ship\r\nclassed A 1 for eight years is examined by Lloyd’s surveyors at the end of\r\nfour years. “She may again, at the request of the owner, be examined for\r\ncontinuation, _i.e._, to be continued A 1 for a further term; usually\r\ntwo-thirds of that originally granted. She may again and again be\r\nre-examined for continuation, or, if she have meantime gone into a lower\r\nclass, be examined for restoration to the character A, but each of these\r\nsurveys is increased in thoroughness and stringency as the age of the ship\r\nincreases. When from age she ceases to be entitled to the character A in\r\nthe opinion of Lloyd’s surveyor, but is still tight enough and strong\r\nenough to carry valuable merchandise to any part of the world, she is\r\nclassed A red, usually for a term of half or two-thirds the original term\r\ngranted her in the first character.... When from increasing age she is no\r\nlonger fit to carry valuable goods for long voyages, she falls back into\r\nclass black, diphthong Æ; while in this class she is deemed fit to carry\r\nthe same class of goods, but only on short voyages (not beyond Europe).\r\nAnd when after survey and re-survey at intervals, as before, she is no\r\nlonger fit to carry valuable goods at all, she falls into class E, and is\r\ndeemed fit only to carry goods which sea-water won’t hurt, as metallic\r\nores, coal, coke, &c.” And so it goes on till she is classed 1; and when\r\nshe is run through her terms here she is said to have run out of her\r\nclasses: to be, in fact, an “unclassed ship.” The lettering is slightly\r\nvaried for iron ships. But it must be remembered that all this submitting\r\nto survey is entirely optional, and that a newly-built ship may be\r\n“unclassed” also. In the former case—a ship which has run out of all its\r\nclasses—the vessel is usually fit for nothing more than a river trip, and\r\nought really to be broken up. It is then that the disreputable shipowner\r\nsteps in and purchases her. Happy is it for its poor crew if she does not\r\nprove their coffin!\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: INTERIOR OF LLOYD’S.]\r\n\r\nIt may be asked, as Lloyd’s will now have nothing to do with such a rotten\r\ntub, How does the owner get anyone to insure it? It is generally done by\r\nmutual insurance clubs formed among these very owners, though not\r\nexclusively. Plimsoll says: “It almost seems as if there was a race who\r\nshould lose his ships first on the formation of a new club, so great are\r\nthe sums the members are called upon to pay as premium;” and such clubs\r\nare constantly failing.\r\n\r\nTo be classed A 1 in anything is good, and, as applied to a ship at\r\nLloyd’s, means, as we all know, that the vessel is first-class in every\r\nparticular. But what is Lloyd’s? Many readers would find it difficult to\r\ngive a clear answer to this query. The secretary of that institution told\r\nM. Esquiros, when that distinguished writer was visiting England, that he\r\nreceived many business letters addressed to “Mr. Lloyd,” and we all know\r\nthere was long, in fact, a celebrated Lloyd’s Coffee-house in the City,\r\nwhere the merchants interested in maritime matters used to congregate. A\r\npoem, “The Wealthy Shopkeeper, or Charitable Christian,” published in\r\n1700, alludes to the establishment, and the writer adds, as an addendum,\r\nthat the London merchant at that time never missed “resorting to Lloyd’s\r\nto read his letters and attend sales.” Later, Steele and Addison both\r\nspoke of it in the same light. “The veritable, personal Lloyd,” says\r\nEsquiros, “as we see, has made a great deal more noise in the world after\r\nhis death than he ever did during his lifetime.” The name of the\r\ncoffee-house keeper has become inseparably connected with the greatest\r\nmaritime institution of the world.\r\n\r\nThe original Lloyd was a wonderfully good example of a pushing London\r\ncitizen. Little was, speaking in these later days, known of Edward of that\r\nilk till Mr. Frederick Martin unearthed, in the vaults of the Royal\r\nExchange, a long-forgotten series of its archives. Then he found “huge\r\nstores of manuscript papers and immense leather-cased folios, partly\r\nsinged in the great fire which, in 1838, destroyed the Royal Exchange\r\nabove them.” Now we know that Lloyd, early in the reign of Charles II.,\r\nkept a coffee-house in Tower Street, and contrived to make it the\r\ngathering point for the underwriters, who had been previously scattered\r\nall over the city. This house was near the Custom House, the Navy Office,\r\nand the Trinity House, as well as to the Thames “below bridge,” and the\r\nposition was obviously a good one for the purpose. Having surrounded\r\nhimself with a growing connection in Tower Ward, Lloyd found himself in a\r\nposition to approach the haunts of the leading merchants and bankers, and\r\nwe find him in 1693 securely established at the corner of Lombard Street\r\nand Abchurch Lane, near the spot where the Lombard Street post-office now\r\nstands. Here he held periodical auction sales “by the candle,” and started\r\na weekly paper devoted to maritime affairs, the first of its kind: indeed\r\nit was, saving the _London Gazette_, the only London newspaper yet in\r\nexistence. But he now met a severe blow, for, as we learn from Macaulay,\r\n“the judges were unanimously of opinion that this liberty (of printing)\r\ndid not extend to gazettes,” and that, by English law, no man not\r\nauthorised by the Crown had the right to publish political news. The said\r\npolitical news in this case consisted of mere headings and brief\r\nparagraphs, as, “Yesterday the Lords passed the Bill to restrain the\r\nwearing of all wrought silks from India,” or that they had received a\r\n“petition from the Quakers.” Lloyd had to succumb and stop the\r\npublication, but his sales of ships and cargoes increased, so that in\r\nfifteen or twenty years Lloyd’s had become the recognised London centre of\r\nmaritime business, including marine insurance. From this comparatively\r\nsmall beginning has sprung the all-powerful organisation whose agents are\r\nto be found in every part of the habitable globe.\r\n\r\n“When,” says a writer already quoted, “I landed, about three years back,\r\nupon one of the group of rocks lost in the bosom of the waves, and which\r\nare called the Scilly Islands, there was only one thing which brought\r\nLondon to my mind, and that was the name ‘Lloyd’s’, in letters of brass,\r\non the door of one of the least poor-looking houses. I might have gone\r\nmuch further afield, into some of the still wilder islands of the Old or\r\nNew World, and there, even at the very ends of the earth—provided only\r\nthat there was a town or port of some sort—I should have found an agent of\r\nthis English society. The definition of Lloyd’s which was given by a City\r\nmerchant can now be better understood by us. ‘It is,’ said he, ‘a spider\r\nplanted in the centre of a web which covers the whole sea, and the\r\nshipwrecked vessels are the dead flies.’”(38)\r\n\r\n“The loose connection existing between the underwriters of London,” says\r\nthe leading authority on the subject,(39) “as frequenters of the same\r\ncoffee-house, where they carried on their business transactions, formed\r\nitself into a final ‘system of membership’ by transmigration to the Royal\r\nExchange in 1774. The author and leading spirit in this all-important\r\nmovement, which had far-reaching consequences for the commerce, not only\r\nof England, but for that of the whole world, was Mr. John Julius\r\nAngerstein, a native of St. Petersburg, but of German extraction,\r\ndescended from an old and highly respected family of merchants.” The\r\nwriter goes on to show how young Angerstein, from junior clerk, had risen\r\nto be a successful merchant and underwriter. He became one of the most\r\nhonoured of those who assembled at Lloyd’s Coffee-house, as he was a most\r\nsagacious and far-seeing man, of unimpeachable integrity, and when the\r\nmovement for obtaining a suitable home for the underwriters was mooted he\r\nwas its greatest supporter. He became virtually the leader in the whole\r\nmatter, and seventy-nine underwriters agreed to pay one hundred pounds\r\neach to start it fairly. Thus was the “New Lloyd’s,” as it was then\r\ncalled, first organised. It is not, nor ever has been, an insurance\r\n_company_, but rather a fraternity of merchants, shipowners, bankers, and\r\ncapitalists subscribing for a place where they could meet and transact\r\nbusiness. It is a maritime exchange. But each man is guided by his own\r\nintelligence, and must measure the extent of business which he undertakes\r\nby the standard of his personal capital.\r\n\r\n“The English merchant especially,” says Esquiros, in his charming work,\r\n“having so many bonds of union with the ocean, can hardly expect to always\r\nhave tranquil sleep. Let the south-west squalls be ever so little let\r\nloose, the ruin of his house and family is hoarsely muttered through his\r\ndreams. Oh, if he could only see from afar the good ship in which he has\r\nrisked the better part of his fortune! In the morning he rushes to\r\nLloyd’s, the fountain-head of all marine news. Nothing, either in his face\r\nor conduct, shows the least emotion—he has the art of veiling his features\r\nwith a mask of indifference; but what a tempest of anxiety rages under\r\nthis outward calm! He asks himself a thousand questions: What does the\r\ntelegraph say? What ships have touched at distant ports? What are the\r\nnames of those which have reached England? To all these questions and many\r\nmore he finds answers affixed to the walls of the vestibule. There the\r\nlists and advices give exactly the maritime bulletin of the day. But the\r\ncritical moment has yet to come; this man, whose whole fortune perhaps is\r\non the sea, has not at present consulted the ‘Loss Book,’ or, as it is\r\nalso called, the ‘Black Book.’”\r\n\r\nThis gloom-inspiring volume is placed by itself on a high desk, and each\r\ncan refer to it in turn. It is, of course, written by hand, and contains\r\nevery day the wreck record, briefly told. Laconic as is the formal\r\nrecord—the name of the ship, destination, nature of cargo, coast on which\r\nshipwrecked, and so forth—there have been as many as twelve pages\r\nblackened with the sad summary of the losses announced by telegraph during\r\none day. “In each of these announcements—frigid and taciturn as fate\r\nitself—the mind may conjure up many a sad drama. How many human lives are\r\nthere sacrificed? This is often the fact of which the ‘Black Book’ takes\r\nbut little notice; the matter with which it has exclusively to deal is the\r\nproperty insured against the perfidy of the sea. Who was the insurer? and\r\nwho has lost? These are the great questions. It is also remarkable, after\r\na storm, to see with what anxious and fidgety hands some of the insurance\r\nspeculators turn over the pages of this sibylline book.” And no wonder:\r\nfor the underwriter(40) is a speculator who is taking long odds against a\r\nterrible gambler—the ocean.\r\n\r\nThe Underwriters’ Room at Lloyd’s to-day is a splendid hall, with\r\nScagliola columns and richly decorated ceiling, and mahogany tables placed\r\nat intervals all round the room. “What an animated, yet demure, hubbub is\r\nhere!” says the French writer before quoted. “One might fancy that the\r\nsea, with the thoughts of which every brain is occupied here, had imparted\r\nsome of its agitation and uproar to the business world. The current of\r\nnews, transactions taking place, and chat going on, runs from one end of\r\nthe hall to the other with a kind of deep murmuring roar.” Those going to\r\nand fro are of two very distinct classes—the insurers of ships and the\r\ninsurance brokers. The latter have become very necessary, the reason being\r\nas follows:—The merchant who wishes to insure a ship, or a certain kind of\r\nmerchandise that he is about to export, may by no means always meet the\r\nunderwriter who is prepared to take that particular risk. While he is\r\ntrying to insure his ship she may have already started—may even be at the\r\nbottom of the sea. In the latter case a delay might be fatal, for the news\r\nonce arrived that his ship had been wrecked, he could not, of course,\r\neffect any insurance. He therefore goes to a broker who knows the habits\r\nof the place, and probably the very underwriter whose means or known\r\npredilections for certain forms of investment will make him desirous of\r\ntaking the risk.\r\n\r\nThe business of Lloyd’s is conducted by a committee of twelve influential\r\nmembers, while the working staff includes a secretary, clerks, and a staff\r\nof assistants technically known as “waiters,” which would make it seem as\r\nthough the odour of the original Lloyd’s Coffee-house still clung to the\r\nbody. The funds of Lloyd’s Association, as it might be termed, are large,\r\nand are used to great advantage: partly in charity bestowed upon\r\ndeserving, though unfortunate seamen, and partly in rewards, in various\r\nforms, to special cases of merit. It costs an underwriter £50 entrance fee\r\nand £12 annual subscription to belong to it; the brokers are let off for\r\nabout half the above rates; an ordinary subscriber pays £5 per annum for\r\nthe privilege of entering the rooms of the Association. We have now traced\r\nthe history of the greatest maritime company of the world, one that could\r\nonly belong to a great nation. No other could devise, much less support\r\nit.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: THE “GREAT EASTERN” IN A GALE OFF CAPE CLEAR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MR. I. K. BRUNEL. MR. SCOTT RUSSELL.

The\r\ngreatest ship of this or any other age has not proved a success, except\r\nfor some very special purposes for which no other vessel would have proved\r\navailable. The history of the _Great Eastern_ is one of interest to all,\r\nand especially to too sanguine and over-ambitious individuals and\r\ncompanies.\r\n\r\nIn reply to an advertisement from the Admiralty in 1851 for the conveyance\r\nof the East Indian and Australian mails, was an application from a new\r\norganisation, the Eastern Steam Navigation Company. This offer was\r\ndeclined, and then some of the directors, on the suggestion of Mr. I. K.\r\nBrunel, the great engineer, recommended the construction of a steam-ship\r\nof extraordinary dimensions to trade with India. Having made calculations\r\nthat the big ship intended could maintain a speed of fifteen knots an\r\nhour, there was, in their judgment, no doubt that they would attract a\r\nproportion of the traffic so handsome as to afford full cargoes both\r\noutward and homeward. Many of the original shareholders withdrew, but a\r\nlarge number held firm. Brunel argued that there need be no limit to the\r\nsize of a ship, except what quality of material imposed. He further urged\r\nfrom scientific theory and actual experience, that upon the “tubular\r\nprinciple,” which provided the greatest amount of strength of construction\r\nwith any given material, it was possible to construct a ship of six times\r\nthe capacity of the largest vessel then afloat,(41) and one, too, that\r\nwould steam at a speed hitherto unattainable by smaller vessels. Mr. Scott\r\nRussell, the eminent ship-builder, shared these views. The idea of having\r\ntwo sets of engines and two propellers—paddle-wheels and screw—was solely\r\ndue to Mr. Brunel, as was also the adoption of the cellular construction,\r\nlike that at the top and bottom of the Britannia Bridge. Her model in\r\ngeneral construction was like that of the ships built by Scott Russell, on\r\nthe principle of the “wave line,” which he had carried out during the\r\nprevious twenty years. In spite of much virulent criticism, the\r\nconstruction of a 25,000 ton vessel was commenced on May 1st, 1854, in\r\nScott Russell’s yard, at Millwall, on the north side of the Thames.\r\n\r\nNovel as was the construction of the ship, the mode devised for her launch\r\nwas no less novel. As her immense length would render it impossible to\r\nlaunch her in the usual manner and by the force of her own gravity, she\r\nwas built lengthwise to the river on cradles, which carried her upright\r\nand dispensed with “shores.” These cradles were made to travel on a double\r\nseries of “ways,” each 120 feet in breadth, which were carried to\r\nlow-water mark. The ways were 300 feet in length, with an incline of one\r\nin twelve. At the stem and stern were placed a powerful hydraulic ram to\r\ngive the first start, and when she was once in motion her progress was to\r\nbe kept up in the following manner. On the river-side four large lighters\r\nwere moored in the tideway, and were to work with crabs and sheaves or\r\npulleys upon chains, fastened to the vessel amidships. Two lighters were\r\nalso moored at the stem and two at the stern of the vessel. The chains\r\npassing from the ship to these latter were returned again on shore, so as\r\nto be worked with a double purchase. Small stationary engines on land were\r\nto be used to haul on these, making a force available to pull the vessel\r\noff the shore. The calculations, as the event proved, were made on a false\r\nnotion of the amount of friction to be overcome, and the attention of the\r\nengineer had been chiefly directed to prevent her dashing into the water\r\nwith too great a speed. For this purpose two powerful drums had been\r\nconstructed, to which the cradles were attached by enormous sheaves of\r\ncast iron, expressly cast for this purpose, and weighing five tons each.\r\nOne sheave was fastened to each cradle, and wrought-iron chain cables of\r\nthe largest size connected these with two other sheaves, each of which was\r\nscrewed to the drum which was to pay out the chain and, in fact, regulate\r\nthe whole operation. The axle of the drum was set in a frame of iron,\r\nwhile around its outer edge passed a band of iron, to work in the manner\r\nof a friction-clutch, or break. This, with the aid of strong iron levers\r\ntwenty feet long, brought such a pressure to bear upon the discs of the\r\ndrum as to entirely stop them in case of the chain being paid out too\r\nfast. Everything being thus prepared that human ingenuity could devise (as\r\nwas supposed), the launch was fixed for the 3rd of November, 1857. On that\r\nday, although the sight-seeing public did not congregate in large numbers,\r\nand the scaffolding erected on many points was untenanted, yet there was a\r\nswarm of well-laden craft of all kinds on the river, and crowds on both\r\nits banks and around the yard. The engineers and men of science mustered\r\nstrongly, not only from all parts of England, but from Germany, France,\r\nAmerica, and Russia. The Comte de Paris, the Duke d’Aumale, the Siamese\r\nAmbassadors, and some of the Lords of the Admiralty, were the most\r\nconspicuous persons present.\r\n\r\nAt half-past one Miss Hope, the daughter of the chairman of the company,\r\nappeared, and dashing a bottle of wine on the bows, bade the Leviathan, as\r\nshe was originally called, “God speed!” amid the cheers of those\r\nassembled. In a few moments afterwards the word was passed to commence the\r\nlaunch. At the signals the lighters slowly but steadily commenced to haul\r\ntaut their tackle from the river. This strain appeared to have no effect\r\non the vessel. It remained stationary for about ten minutes, when the\r\npeculiar hissing noise of the hydraulic rams at work to push her off was\r\nheard. It should have been mentioned that each of the drums was\r\nconstructed so as to be turned by ordinary windlasses, in order to wind up\r\nthe slack chain between the drums and the cradles; otherwise, if any slack\r\nwere left when the hydraulic rams started the vessel, it would run it\r\nrapidly out, and dreadful consequences might ensue. When the “rams” began\r\nto work, the order was distinctly given to “wind up” the slack between the\r\ndrum and the cradle. This was done at the forward drum; but,\r\nunfortunately, at the stern of the vessel the men did precisely the\r\nreverse, and uncoiled more slack chain. Suddenly there was a cry “She\r\nmoves! She moves!” The fore part of the vessel slipped, and the stern\r\nrushed down some three or four feet in the space of a couple of seconds,\r\nin consequence of the slack chain from the after drum offering not the\r\nleast check. In an instant the strain came upon the drum, which was\r\ndragged round, and, of course, as that was connected with the windlass by\r\nmultiplying wheels, the latter turned round some ten or fifteen times for\r\nevery foot the drum moved. The men at the windlass madly tried to hold it,\r\nbut the heavy iron handle flew round like lightning, striking them, and\r\nhurling five or six high into the air as if they had been blown up by some\r\npowerful explosion. A panic seemed to spread as this disastrous accident\r\ntook place, and the men stationed at the tackle and fall of the lever next\r\nthe windlass rushed away. Fortunately for the lives of hundreds of the\r\nspectators, the men at the lever at the other side of the drum stood firm,\r\nand, hauling on their tackle, drew their lever up, and applied the break\r\non the drum with such terrific force that the ship instantly stopped,\r\nthough she seemed to quiver under the sudden shock as if she had received\r\na violent blow. The injured men were then carried off to a neighbouring\r\nhouse, where one of them shortly died. When the wreck of the accident had\r\nbeen cleared away, it was determined to make another effort to launch the\r\nvessel, but without effect; for all pressure that the “rams” could apply\r\nwas found insufficient to move her. After straining for some time, the\r\npiston-rod of one of the hydraulic rams gave way, and this accident put an\r\nend to the attempt to launch the great ship for this day.\r\n\r\nNumerous hydraulic machines were now borrowed and fixed, fresh tackle\r\napplied, and many novel and ingenious expedients adopted. It was thought\r\nnecessary to await the next spring tides, in order that the monster when\r\nshe should be launched might find a sufficient depth of water. The\r\nprecaution was needless; many weary weeks were to pass before she was\r\nafloat. On some days, when every exertion seemed vain, she would\r\ncapriciously slip a few inches at the stem or stern. After a long\r\ninterval, another small distance would be accomplished; sometimes a day’s\r\njourney would be three or four feet, sometimes twenty or thirty. Finally,\r\nby continued perseverance, she was brought down the ways until she was\r\nimmersed some eight or ten feet at high water, and then, as the final\r\nlaunch was certain of accomplishment, it was thought desirable to leave\r\nher till the high tides of January should rise so far as to aid materially\r\nin her final flotation, and make it practicable to tow her to a secure\r\nberth, where her last fittings could be put in, and she could be made\r\nready for a voyage.\r\n\r\nWith the spring tides the water rose under the great ship nearly eighteen\r\nfeet; and on the 31st January she gave such signs of buoyancy that it was\r\nresolved to float her on that day. The tide ran up with unusual swiftness,\r\nand as the flood relieved the weight upon the launching ways some of the\r\nhydraulic machines were set to work, for the last time, to push the\r\nmonster as far as possible towards the centre of the river. She moved\r\neasily; and at half-past one the men in the rowing boats stationed\r\nalongside observed that she no longer rested on the cradles—that she was,\r\nin fact, afloat. The tugs fastened to her began steaming ahead, and showed\r\nthat at last she was fairly under way. Then the cheers which arose from\r\nthe yard and from the decks, from the boats in the river, and the crews of\r\nthe ships at anchor up and down the stream, spread the great news far and\r\nwide; and thus, under the most favourable circumstances, the huge vessel\r\ncommenced her first voyage on the Thames.\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: THE LAUNCH OF THE “GREAT EASTERN.”]\r\n\r\nAnd now we must give some description of her internal arrangements and\r\naccommodations. The hull is divided transversely into ten separate\r\ncompartments of 60 feet each, and rendered perfectly watertight by\r\nbulkheads, through which there is no opening whatever below the second\r\ndeck. Two longitudinal walls of iron, 36 feet apart, traverse 350 feet of\r\nthe ship. This mighty vessel was destined to afford accommodation for\r\n4,000 passengers, viz., 800 first class, 2,000 second class, and 1,200\r\nthird class, and a crew of 400. The series of saloons, which were\r\nelegantly fitted and furnished, together with the sleeping apartments, are\r\nsituated in the middle of the ship, and extend over 350 feet of her\r\nlength. The lofty saloons and cabins are very imposing, more resembling\r\nthe drawing-rooms of Belgravia than ordinary cabins. The “Grand Saloon” is\r\n62 feet long, 36 feet wide, and 12 feet high, with a ladies’ cabin, or\r\nrather boudoir, 20 feet in length. Massive looking-glasses in highly\r\nornamented gilt frames decorate its sides. The strong iron beams overhead\r\nare encased in wood, the mouldings being delicately painted and enriched\r\nwith gilt beading. Around two of the funnels which pass through this\r\ngorgeous apartment are large mirrors, with alternate highly ornamented\r\npanels, and at their base are groupings of velvet couches. The walls are\r\nhung with rich patterns in raised gold and white, and at the angles are\r\narabesque panels, while sofas covered with Utrecht velvet, buffets of\r\nrichly carved walnut-wood, carpets of surpassing softness, and _portières_\r\nof rich crimson silk to all the doorways, give an elegance to the whole\r\nfar surpassing the gigantic toy ships of ancient monarchs. The\r\npaddle-wheel engines can be made to give 5,000 horse-power, and the\r\nscrew-engines 6,000 horse-power; making 11,000 in all.\r\n\r\nOn the 9th September, 1859, the vessel, which had now been re-christened\r\nthe _Great Eastern_, took her first trip from the Thames under the most\r\nfavourable circumstances, the weather being very fine, with a light breeze\r\nof wind, and blue sky overhead. Starting with four tugs, two on the bow\r\nand two at the quarter, to guide her through the narrow parts of the\r\nriver, after some delay and a few slight mishaps, she reached Purfleet,\r\nwhere she anchored for the night. At daylight on the following morning,\r\nshe started for the Nore, where she arrived about noon, having attained a\r\nspeed of thirteen knots an hour, though going only at half-speed, her\r\nengines making not more than eight revolutions a minute. From the Nore the\r\n_Great Eastern_ proceeded successfully to Whitstable, where she anchored,\r\ngetting under weigh there at a quarter past nine on the following morning,\r\nwith a fresh breeze. After passing Margate she encountered a stiff gale,\r\nin which she appeared quite at ease when large ships were under\r\ndouble-reefed topsails, and small vessels were obliged to lie to. But an\r\nunfortunate accident occurred to her when off Hastings, through the\r\nexplosion of one of her funnel-casings, causing the death of six men\r\nemployed in the engineering department, injuring various others, and,\r\ndestroying nearly all the mirrors and other ornamental furniture in the\r\ngrand saloon. No injury was, however, done to the hull or machinery of the\r\nvessel sufficient to prevent her proceeding on her voyage to Weymouth,\r\nwhich she reached without any further misfortune, on the afternoon of\r\nFriday, within the time anticipated for her arrival. On her arrival, the\r\npilot who had been in charge of her from Deptford to Portland (Weymouth\r\nBay) made an official report of her performances to the Company,\r\nconfirming, in some measure, the glowing accounts in many of the public\r\njournals, and realising the sanguine expectations of the directors, though\r\ntheir hopes of profit had been somewhat damped by the accident which,\r\napart from the loss of life, entailed an outlay of £5,000. The necessary\r\nrepairs having been completed, the _Great Eastern_ proceeded from Portland\r\nto Holyhead, but without passengers as originally contemplated. Starting\r\nat noon of the 8th of October she made the run to Holyhead in forty hours,\r\nat an average speed of close upon thirteen knots, or more than fifteen\r\nstatute miles in the hour, having on some occasions attained a speed of\r\nfifteen knots an hour. But upon the whole the expectations that had been\r\nformed of her were disappointed. The paddles proved defective either in\r\npower or mode of fitting; and the utmost speed attained fell far short of\r\ncalculation. It began to be suspected that the power of her engines was\r\nnot proportioned to her tonnage, and the ship was found to roll\r\nconsiderably. It should have been mentioned that, whilst lying outside\r\nHolyhead harbour for the purpose of further trials, she became exposed to\r\nthe full fury of the hurricane of the 26th October. In this terrific storm\r\nthe ship behaved nobly, but was at one time in considerable danger of\r\nbeing driven ashore. She returned to Southampton, and was berthed for the\r\nwinter in Southampton Water.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st January, the captain of the _Great Eastern_, Captain Harrison,\r\nwas drowned in Southampton Water by the capsizing of a small boat carrying\r\nhim from the ship to the town. The boat, which was fully manned by six\r\npicked seamen and the captain’s coxswain, was seized in a sudden squall\r\nnear the dock-gates, and upset before the trysail could be lowered. Boats\r\nwere at once put off from the _Indus_ to the rescue, but when Captain\r\nHarrison was reached, the body was floating a little under water, and life\r\nwas quite extinct—death being apparently the result of apoplexy caused by\r\nthe intense cold. The coxswain was found insensible close by, and survived\r\nonly till the evening. A fine youth, son of the chief purser, was also\r\ndrowned; the chief purser himself (Mr. Lay), and Dr. Watson were amongst\r\nthose saved with the crew.\r\n\r\nThe _Great Eastern_ made her first Transatlantic voyage to New York after\r\na very successful but by no means rapid passage of ten days and a half. In\r\nmany respects the vessel fully answered the expectations of her builders.\r\nHer vast bulk aided the fineness of her lines in cutting through the\r\nopposing waves without any apparent shock. To those which rolled upon her\r\nsides she rose with a easy swing, and they passed to leeward, seemingly\r\ndeprived of their fury; others struck her with full force, but no\r\nvibration or shock was communicated to the vast mass. It was speedily\r\ndiscovered that there were two prime defects in her appointments—it was\r\nimpossible to raise the steam in the boilers which animate the\r\npaddle-wheel engines to the full power; and the wheels themselves were not\r\nso placed as to act on the water with effect.\r\n\r\nOn the 21st, the power of the ship was put to a most trying test. A strong\r\nnorthwesterly gale had raised a rough sea. “It has always been said that\r\nshe never could or would pitch, but the truth is this ship does just the\r\nsame on a small scale that ordinary vessels in a sea may do on a very\r\nlarge one. The _Great Eastern_ against a head sea makes a majestic rise\r\nand fall, where a steamer of 2,000, or even 3,000, tons would be labouring\r\nheavily, and perhaps taking in great seas over her bows. On this Thursday\r\nshe dipped down below her hawse pipes. It was a fine sight to watch her\r\nmotion from the bows, splitting the great waves before her into two\r\nstreams of water, like double fountains, and to look along her immense\r\nexpanse of deck as she rose and fell with a motion so easy and regular\r\nthat the duration of each movement could be timed to the very second.”\r\n\r\nOn the 23rd, the ship being off the banks of Newfoundland, the temperature\r\ndecreased so rapidly that it was feared that floating icebergs were near,\r\nand the speed was slackened, and precautions taken against accident; and,\r\non the 26th, when not more than 450 miles from New York, the ship ran into\r\na dense fog, through which she had to feel her way. These circumstances\r\nmaterially affected the duration of the voyage. The most anxious part of\r\nthe whole navigation was now at hand—the passage over the shoals and bars\r\nwhich impede the passage to New York harbour, and the ship was repeatedly\r\nstopped to take soundings. All dangers were boldly passed, and the dawn of\r\nthe 27th showed the coast in a dim blue line, with the spit of Sandy Hook\r\nlying like a haze across the sea. The lighthouse was passed at 7·20 a.m.,\r\nand the _Great Eastern_ had completed her first Transatlantic voyage. From\r\nSandy Hook the vessel passed into the harbour, stirring up the sand on the\r\nbar, but escaping all danger by the admirable readiness with which she\r\nanswered her helm. The advent of the great ship had been expected in\r\nAmerica with an eagerness which cast into the shade even the interest\r\ntaken in her at home. She was a great and startling “fact.” Therefore, no\r\nsooner was her arrival telegraphed, than the bay was studded with yachts,\r\nschooners, and steam-ships, whose passengers marked every portion of her\r\nprogress with vociferous cheers; all the ships were covered with flags,\r\nthe bells rang out, the cannon roared, the wharfs and houses were crowded\r\nwith enthusiastic welcomers. Even the Government Fort Hamilton fired a\r\nsalute of fourteen guns. The return voyage was uneventful. In May, 1861,\r\nshe again started from Milford Haven for New York, on an ordinary\r\npassenger voyage, and made a very successful, but not very rapid, passage\r\nof nine days thirteen and a half hours, the greatest distance run in one\r\nday being 410 statute miles. She commenced the return voyage on the 25th\r\nMay, and arrived off Liverpool in nine and a half days, running in one day\r\n416 statute miles.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: ARRIVAL OF THE “GREAT EASTERN” AT NEW YORK.]\r\n\r\nWhen civil war in the United States forced on the English Government the\r\nfact of the defenceless state of Canada, it was resolved to send out\r\nreinforcements with the greatest speed, and the _Great Eastern_ was taken\r\nup as a troop-ship to convey 2,500 men, 100 officers, and 122 horses. In\r\naddition to these, were about 350 wives and children of the soldiers. She\r\nsailed from the Mersey on the 27th of June, and made her voyage with such\r\nspeed and safety that her real use appeared to have been discovered at\r\nlast. This success inspired confidence, and when she was next announced to\r\nsail with passengers, nearly 400 persons engaged first and second-class\r\nberths. Among them were several parties, and an unusual proportion of\r\nladies. A very considerable cargo was also sent on freight. She left the\r\nMersey on the 10th September, and commenced her voyage with every prospect\r\nof success. But, when about 250 miles westward of Cape Clear, she was\r\ncaught in a tremendous gale. She appears to have been in the very centre\r\nof a cyclone hurricane. In the midst of this whirlwind one of the forward\r\nboats broke loose. The captain ordered the helm to be put down, in order\r\nto bring the ship up into the wind, that the boat might clear the wheel.\r\nThe ship refused to answer her helm. Some hand-sails were then set with\r\nthe same object, but they were instantly blown to shreds. Soon a terrific\r\nnoise was heard, and it was clear that something had gone wrong with her\r\nmachinery. The waves had struck her paddles with such force that they were\r\nbent, and scraped the ship’s side at every revolution, threatening to\r\nshear away her iron planking. Under these circumstances it was necessary\r\nto stop the paddle engines and trust to the propeller for progress. This,\r\nof course, did not add to the power of steering; for, if the helm was\r\ninsufficient when the power was amidships, it was, of course, still less\r\neffectual when the power was all astern. The ship, therefore, lay exposed\r\nto the tremendous lashing of the sea, which ran mountains high. One by one\r\nthe floats were struck away, and at daybreak the next morning nothing of\r\nthe paddle-wheels was left except twisted iron rods attached to the shaft.\r\nNor was this the extent of the misfortune. The stress upon the rudder, now\r\nthat it had to control the entire length of the ship, was tremendous, and\r\nabout 5.45 a.m., during a terrific sea, the top of the rudder-post, a bar\r\nof iron ten inches square, was wrenched away. The ship had now entirely\r\nlost steerage power, and lay utterly at the mercy of the waves. She rolled\r\ntremendously. The hapless passengers were dashed from side to side; the\r\ncabin furniture broke loose, as well as the cargo, crushing everything\r\nthey touched. In the hold, tallow-casks, weighing many hundredweight, and\r\na chain cable of many tons, got loose in one of the compartments, and\r\nthreatened to burst out the ship’s side at every roll. Many of the\r\npassengers were severely injured. The decks were swept, six boats were\r\ncarried away, and two were broken to pieces. In this precarious condition\r\nthe ship lay from Thursday to Sunday evening, a waif upon the ocean. At\r\nlength, on Sunday afternoon, the violence of the wind abated, the sea went\r\ndown, and chains were got out and connected with the rudder, so that some,\r\nthough a very imperfect, purchase was obtained. Some apparatus was\r\nconstructed and got overboard, by which the ship was steadied and the\r\nsteering power increased. By these means her head was got round and a\r\ncourse was made for Cork Harbour. On Tuesday she was off the Old Head of\r\nKinsale, and in the afternoon at the entrance of Cork Harbour, but she was\r\nunable to enter. She therefore remained outside in great peril, for she\r\nwas blown out to sea again, and drifted to some distance before she was\r\nenabled to enter. Her subsequent history, in connection with the laying of\r\nthe Atlantic cable, belongs to another section of this work.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: THE “MONITOR” PASSING THE VICKSBURG BATTERIES.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\n\r\n        THE HISTORY OF SHIPS AND SHIPPING INTERESTS (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Ironclad Question—One of the Topics of the Day—What is to be\r\n       their Value in Warfare?—Story of the Dummy Ironclad—Two Real\r\n        Ironclads vanquished by it—Experience on board an American\r\n    Monitor—Visit of the _Miantonoma_ to St. John’s—Her Tour round the\r\n      World—Her Turrets and Interior Arrangements—Firing off the Big\r\n        Guns—Inside the Turret—“Prepare!”—Effects of the Firing—A\r\n      Boatswain’s-mate’s Opinion—The _Monitor_ goes round the World\r\n        safely—Few of the Original American Ironclads left—English\r\n                     Ironclads—The _Warrior_—Various\r\n     Types—Iron-built—Wood-built—Wood-covered—The Greatest Result yet\r\n        attained, the _Inflexible_—Circular Ironclads—The “_Garde\r\n      Côtes_”—Cost of Ironclads—The Torpedo Question—The Marquis of\r\n      Worcester’s Inventions—Bishop Wilkins’ Subaqueous Ark—Fulton’s\r\n     Experiments—A Frightened Audience—A Hulk Blown Up—Government Aid\r\n     to Fulton—The _Argus_ and her “Crinoline”—Torpedoes successfully\r\n    foiled—Their use during the American War—Brave Lieut.

Day by day we hear of new types of armoured vessels, single\r\nspecimens costing the price of a small fleet of former days. That, under\r\ncertain conditions, they must prove very formidable, there can be no\r\ndoubt. But, it must be asked, are the bulk of them seaworthy ships? How\r\nfar is torpedo warfare to interfere with their employment? Are they worth\r\ntheir price to the nation?\r\n\r\nTheir history so far has been one as much, and indeed far more, of failure\r\nthan success. “Our submarine fleet” has become a byword, while none of\r\ntheir exploits have excelled those of the _Merrimac_ and _Monitor_, two of\r\nthe very earliest examples constructed. Indeed, the writer knows no more\r\nsuccessful results attained than by an improvised “dummy” ironclad during\r\nthe American war. The ridiculous often merges into or mingles with the\r\nimportant and the sublime, and the story, little known in England, is\r\ninserted here to show how much may sometimes be done in warfare with\r\ninsignificant means.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: PEACE AND WAR.]\r\n\r\nThe incident occurred in February, 1863. An old coal barge(42) adrift had\r\nbeen picked up in the James River, and the brilliant idea seized some of\r\nAdmiral Porter’s men to convert her into a “monitor.” The whole scheme was\r\ncarried out in twelve hours. In fact, her construction was hardly more\r\nsolid than the “paper forts” built of canvas and boards by the Chinese\r\nduring our war with them, and which collapsed after a shot or two as\r\nreadily as would the “Rock of Gibraltar” or “Mount Vesuvius” at a firework\r\ndisplay. The barge was built up high with boards, while funnels and\r\nturrets constructed of pork-barrels reared above, and two old canoes did\r\nduty for quarter-boats. A small house, taken from the back yard of a\r\nplanter’s dwelling, stood for the pilot-house. Her furnaces were built of\r\nmud or clay; they were only intended to make smoke, not steam. Then a good\r\ncoat of black paint or pitch; her furnaces were filled with pitch and\r\nother inflammable materials, and she was ready. As soon as the “dummy”\r\nturned adrift on the Mississippi came in range of the Vicksburg batteries,\r\nthe alarmed garrison opened fire upon it. The black monitor glided down\r\nthe stream, belching out fire and smoke, but gave not a shot in return.\r\nWith amazement the Vicksburg soldiers found that they could not make the\r\nslightest impression on the turreted monster. They did not know that it\r\nwas full of water, and had not a man on board! In ominous and silent\r\ndisdain she seemed to be making for the Confederate ironclads; one of\r\nthem, the _Queen of the West_, leaving part of her crew ashore,\r\nincontinently fled, with all her steam power, making the best of her way\r\nto the Red River. The _Indianola_, a vessel previously captured from the\r\nNortherners, was lying aground, and not to be taken by this ruthless\r\nmonster of a monitor, was ordered to be blown up, which was accordingly\r\ndone. Thus was this bloodless victory gained by the dummy ironclad. It is\r\nnot impossible that we may hear of similar tricks in future warfare, as\r\nall is fair therein.\r\n\r\nThe following experiences on board an American monitor are kindly sent to\r\nthe writer by a friend, formerly in the Royal Navy.\r\n\r\n“Great, indeed, was the excitement caused by the deeds of the _Monitor_\r\nand _Merrimac_ amongst the officers and men of Her Majesty’s North\r\nAtlantic Squadron. Whether dancing in Halifax, chasing French fishermen on\r\nthe Newfoundland coast, or ‘sunning’(43) in St. George, there was always\r\nto be found some one, from captain to loblolly boy, with a new story of\r\nthe prowess of these formidable monsters of the _shallows_! I write\r\n‘shallows’ advisedly, for if the experience which I am about to narrate\r\nproves anything, it will be that as a ‘deep water’ or sea-going craft the\r\n_Monitor_ is practically useless.\r\n\r\n“Notwithstanding a certain eagerness to behold a specimen of their\r\nfloating batteries, curiosity was not destined to be gratified until\r\nnearly two years after the close of the American War, when the United\r\nStates Government determined on sending a representative—the\r\n_Miantonoma_—to make a tour of the world. The object of this resolution\r\nwas to prove that the American invention was not a mere floating battery,\r\nbut was destined to revolutionise the system of armour-plated ships. The\r\n_Miantonoma_ was accompanied when she made her appearance in the harbour\r\nof St. John’s, Newfoundland, by two tenders, one a second-class corvette,\r\nthe other a captured blockade-runner, which had been mounted with a single\r\n‘Parrot’ pivot gun, throwing a spherical shot of 180 lbs. This projectile\r\nwas dubbed ‘the Devil’ by those on board, who were by no means anxious to\r\nhear its voice, for the lightly-built blockade-runner trembled in every\r\nknee at each discharge. Nevertheless, such a vessel properly built is\r\ndestined to play an important part in the navy of the future, when our\r\npresent unwieldy ironclads shall have been relegated to that bourne where\r\ntorpedoes cannot terrify.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: THE “MIANTONOMA.”]\r\n\r\n“The _Miantonoma_ was a twin-turreted monitor, carrying two of Parrot’s\r\n480 pounder smooth-bore. Her spar-deck, which was flush fore and aft, was\r\nabout two and a half to three feet above the surface of the water in\r\nharbour. What we would call the gun-deck was below the water-line some\r\neight feet, and here at sea during any sort of rough weather, the men were\r\ncompelled to live. Air was supplied (faugh! what an atmosphere it was,\r\neven in harbour!) by means of pipes which ran up to a scaffolding—I can\r\nfind no better name for the structure—elevated above the spar-deck fifteen\r\nfeet. Here were the wheel-house and a place for the look-out. But as it\r\nwas apprehended that the first respectable gale would take charge of the\r\nflimsy structure and sweep it all away, a ‘preventer’ steering apparatus\r\nworked below, and knowledge was gained of what was going on in the upper\r\nworld by means of reflectors. Two things struck the eye of an observant\r\nstranger on gaining the side. The first was the formidable appearance of\r\nthe turrets—the latter, _mirabile dictu_, the number of spittoons! At once\r\nit became evident that such a craft as that which, if you please, we are\r\nnow aboard of, could never be taken by boarding. Given the flush deck\r\nfilled with an armed host; one of these terrible turrets would slowly turn\r\nround, the shield protecting the embrasure would fly back, a gaping\r\nvolcano would belch forth, a whirlwind of flame and smoke only—no need,\r\nindeed, would there be for iron orbs at such quarters—and, ere its shield\r\nhad once more covered grinning death, the armed host would have been swept\r\naway.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: INTERIOR OF A TURRET SHIP.]\r\n\r\n“It is Her Majesty’s birthday, and the _Miantonoma_ steams away with those\r\nwho have been invited on board to witness the firing of the big guns. The\r\nsalute cannot be fired in the little harbour, else surely every pane of\r\nglass from the block-house to Riverhead will pay the penalty. So\r\nFreshwater Bay is to have the honour of hearing man’s thunder\r\nreverberating along its hill-girded shores.\r\n\r\n“Bang, bang—pop, pop, bang. You hear the Armstrongs and old field-pieces\r\ngo off from Her Majesty’s men-of-war in harbour, and Her Majesty’s Fort\r\nWilliam and water batteries. Then you descend to utter silence. You ascend\r\nagain through a trapdoor, and find yourself in a circular room, some\r\ntwelve feet in diameter, padded from top to bottom like the interior of a\r\ncarriage. By your side is a huge mass of iron. You are inside the turret.\r\nA glimmering lamp sheds its feeble light on the moving forms around you,\r\nand from below comes the faint whispering of the men, until the trap is\r\nshut and you are again in utter silence.\r\n\r\n“‘_Prepare!_’ The gunner’s mates stand you on your toes, and tell you to\r\nlean forward and thrust your tongue out of your mouth. You hear the\r\ncreaking of machinery. It is a moment of intense suspense. Gradually a\r\nglimmer of light—an inch—a flood. The shield passes from the opening—the\r\ngun runs out. A flash, a roar—a mad reeling of the senses, and crimson\r\nclouds flitting before your eyes—a horrible pain in your ears, a sense of\r\noppression on your chest, and the knowledge that you are not on your\r\nfeet—a whispering of voices blending with the concert in your ears—a\r\ndarkness before your eyes—and you find yourself plump up in a heap against\r\nthe padding, whither you have been thrown by the violence of the\r\nconcussion. Before you have recovered sufficiently to note the effects I\r\nhave endeavoured to describe, the shield is again in its place and the gun\r\nready for re-loading. They tell you that the best part of the sound has\r\nescaped through the port-hole, otherwise there would be no standing it,\r\nand our gunner’s mate whispers in your ear: ‘It’s all werry well, but they\r\nbusts out bleeding from the chest and ears after the fourth discharge, and\r\nhas to be taken below.’ You have had enough of it too, and are glad that\r\nthey don’t ask you to witness another shot fired.\r\n\r\n“Since the _Miantonoma’s_ time vast improvements have been made in the\r\nmatter of turret firing. The guns are now discharged by means of an\r\nelectric spark, which obviates the necessity for having anyone in the\r\nturret, and is certainly a great blessing.\r\n\r\n“‘And what do you think of her?’ I asked a boatswain’s-mate. ‘Think of\r\nher, sir!’ he replied. ‘I think, sir, that she’s a floating coffin, and I\r\nwould as soon live in ——. Every time we’re out of harbour she goes under\r\nwater, and don’t come up till we get in again, as the saying is. We are\r\njust cooped up here waiting for a big wave to come and swallow us, for she\r\ndon’t rise to the waves, she goes through ’em.’ Then, becoming more\r\nconfidential, ‘Tower of the world be hanged, sir! None of us believe we’ll\r\never see Queenstown, and if we only had a chance to get ashore, there\r\nain’t a man but what would desert, I guess.’\r\n\r\n“I must draw the reader’s attention to the fact that I give this sailor’s\r\nstatement for what it is worth. The officers, one and all, as far as my\r\nmemory serves me, stated that she was a very good sea boat; better,\r\nindeed, than they expected, though somewhat sluggish in the water. I may\r\nadd that the _Miantonoma_ not only reached Queenstown, but _did_ succeed\r\nin making a tour of the world. Yet it was alleged that her crew, with the\r\nexception of some twenty men, were put into the tenders, and that she was\r\ntowed across the ‘herring pond’ and round the Horn by them. From these\r\nfacts and rumours the reader may form his own opinion as to the\r\nseaworthiness of the American monitor. My belief is, that for a sea-fight,\r\nespecially should one occur in a gale of wind, they are practically as\r\nuseless as a hay-barge, while for harbour defences they have proved\r\nthemselves invaluable. Of all the splendid fleet of monitors possessed by\r\nAmerica at the close of the Federal and Confederate war, there are scarce\r\nany left to keep up the reputation of the United States as a naval power.\r\nThey were contract built, of green oak. The Philadelphia and San Francisco\r\nnavy yards afford ample proof that a decade has sufficed to destroy what\r\nshot and shell found almost invulnerable. Such splendid specimens of naval\r\narchitecture as the _Brooklyn_ and _Ohio_ alone are left to keep up the\r\nappearance of America’s naval strength on foreign stations. But let us\r\nhope that her ‘shoddy’ monitors, like her shoddy blankets or wooden\r\nnutmegs, have passed away with her convalescence from intestine wounds,\r\nand that the next decade may witness the Stars and Stripes floating\r\npowerfully and peacefully side by side with the Union Jack, omnipotent for\r\ngood.”\r\n\r\nAny such expression of feeling in regard to the safety of English\r\nironclads, in spite of the terrible loss of the _Captain_, and that of the\r\n_Vanguard_ (only less serious inasmuch as no lives were sacrificed), would\r\nnot be echoed by any British sailor on board them. The accommodations,\r\nbarring the general darkness and sense of gloom inside, only partially\r\nillumined by the fitful light of lamps, are generally good, and it is by\r\nno means certain that when the electric light has attained that perfection\r\nat which its promoters are aiming, there can be any complaint on that\r\nscore at all. Still, until some grand success has been attained by\r\nironclads, it is very questionable whether they can be thoroughly popular,\r\nexcept to courageous, scientific, and ambitious officers, of whom the\r\nservice, the writer is certain, does not stand in need. We have had a “Man\r\nof iron” ashore, and we shall have him afloat when the occasion requires.\r\n\r\nThe first types of ironclads introduced into the Royal Navy, as for\r\nexample, the _Warrior_ and _Black Prince_, were nearly identical in\r\ngeneral appearance to the war-ships of the day. Now _all_ British\r\nironclads are built with sides approaching the upright or vertical above\r\nwater. At first they only attempted broadside fire; now bow and stern guns\r\nare common. The _Warrior_, as the earliest example of an ironclad in the\r\nRoyal Navy, deserves special mention. She is doing duty to-day, and is by\r\nno means an effete example, but an excellent and useful vessel. She is\r\narmoured at the middle only, in the most exposed parts. In other words,\r\nher engines and leading guns are protected, while the rest of her hull,\r\nthough strong, is not armour-covered. _Now_, whatever weight of armour\r\nthis central, or “box-battery,” as it has been termed, may have, there is\r\nalways a continuous belt of iron extending from stem to stern, and\r\nprotecting the region of the water-line and steering gear, the counter of\r\nthe ship being carried below the water in order to screen the rudder-head.\r\nThis improvement is due to Sir Spencer Robinson. The _Warrior’s_ armour\r\nwas uniform in thickness; now it is strongest in the vital parts. The\r\n_Warrior_ had only a main-deck battery armour plated; recent ships have\r\nhad a protected upper-deck battery given them. The _Warrior_ carried a\r\nlarge number of guns in an outspread battery; all later ships, of whatever\r\ntype, have had a _concentrated_ battery of much heavier guns. This early\r\narmoured ship is long; nearly all later examples are much shorter in\r\nproportion to their breadth.\r\n\r\nAnd now to the armour itself, which is sometimes affixed to an iron and\r\nsometimes to a wooden hull, and in a few cases has wood _outside_ it.\r\nThese facts, by no means generally known, must be studied, for it can\r\nhardly yet be said to be determined which is the better form. It may be\r\nsaid, in general terms, that the “adoption of armour-plating was\r\naccompanied in this country by the introduction of iron for the\r\nconstruction of the hulls of ships of war, and our ironclad fleet is for\r\nthe most part _iron-built_. We have, it is true, a number of wood-built\r\nironclads, but most of these are converted vessels.”(44) Several were\r\nbuilt of wood (and then armoured) for the purpose of utilising the large\r\nstocks of timber accumulated in the dockyards. In the future it is\r\nprobable that nearly all will be of iron, with wood backing. The armour of\r\nthe _Warrior_ is only 4½ inches thick, with, however, a “backing” of 18\r\ninches of timber. This type includes the _Black Prince_, _Achilles_,\r\n_Defence_, _Hector_, _Valiant_, and _Prince Albert_. Then we come to\r\nanother series, of which the _Bellerophon_, _Penelope_, _Invincible_,\r\n_Audacious_, _Swiftsure_, _Triumph_, _Iron Duke_, and unfortunate\r\n_Vanguard_ furnish examples. They average 6 inches of iron-plating to 10\r\ninches of wood backing. The lost _Captain_ was somewhat heavier in both\r\nplating and backing. Then again we advance to a still heavier type—12\r\ninches of iron to 18 inches of wood: the _Glatton_, _Thunderer_, and\r\n_Devastation_ furnish examples. Then there is the _wood-built_ class, the\r\nthickness of their (wooden) sides ranging from 19½ to as high as 36\r\ninches, with 4½ to 6 inches of armour. The _Royal Sovereign_ (a turret\r\nship) is a leading example of this class; she has 5½ inches of armour,\r\ncovering 36 inches of wood.\r\n\r\nTo speak of all the types of armour-clad ships would most undoubtedly\r\nweary the reader. Let us examine a leading example. The _Inflexible_\r\n(double turret ship) is probably the greatest result yet attained. She is\r\nan ironclad of 11,400 tons, with 8,000 horse-power, her estimated first\r\ncost being considerably over half a million sterling. She is 320 feet\r\nlong, and has armour of 16 to 24 inches thick, with a backing of 17 to 25\r\ninches of wood. She has no less than 135 compartments, while her engines\r\nare so completely isolated that if one breaks down the other would be\r\nworking. “But already, as if to show the impossibility of attaining the\r\nstage of finality as regards the construction of our men-of-war, there is\r\nevery reason to believe that she has been excelled.... Designed,” says our\r\nleading journal,(45) “as an improvement upon the Russian _Peter the\r\nGreat_, she will herself be surpassed by the two Italian frigates which\r\nare building at La Spezzia and Castellamare.... While the _Inflexible’s_\r\nturrets are formed of a single thickness of 18-inch armour, and her\r\narmament consists of four 81-ton guns, the turrets of the _Dandolo_ and\r\nthe _Duilio_ are built of plates 22 inches thick, and are armed with four\r\n100-ton guns.” The writer then enlarges on recent gunnery experiments,\r\nshowing that even the enormous thickness of the _Inflexible’s_ iron sides\r\nhave been pierced, and concludes by saying that, “so far as the exigencies\r\nof the navy are concerned, the limit of weight seems to have already been\r\nreached, for the simple reason that the buoyancy of our ironclads cannot\r\nwith safety be further diminished by the burden of heavier armour and\r\narmaments.” The leading feature in this vessel is the situation of the\r\nturrets. In most turret ships afloat these batteries are placed on the\r\nmiddle line, and in consequence only one-half the guns can be brought to\r\nbear on an enemy either right ahead or directly astern. In the\r\n_Inflexible_ the turrets rise up on either side of the ship _en échelon_\r\nwithin the citadel walls, the fore turret being on the port side and the\r\nafter turret on the starboard side. By these means the whole of the four\r\nguns can be discharged _simultaneously_ at a ship right ahead or right\r\nastern, or, in pairs, towards any point. What vessel could withstand such\r\na fire rightly directed?\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: THE “INFLEXIBLE.”]\r\n\r\nAs we have seen, the forms and proportions of ironclads have undergone\r\nenormous changes from the days when the success of the plated floating\r\nbatteries at Kinburn called the special attention of Europe to the\r\npossibility of successfully protecting vessels in the same way. The shot\r\nof the enemy had no effect on these batteries. A special correspondent of\r\nthe _Times_ said: “The balls hopped back off their sides without leaving\r\nan impression, save such as a pistol-ball makes on the target of a\r\nshooting gallery. The shot could be heard distinctly striking the sides of\r\nthe battery with a ‘sharp smack,’ and then could be seen flying back,\r\nsplashing the water at various angles according to the direction in which\r\nthey came, till they dropped exhausted.”\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest novelties is the _circular_ ironclad, proposed long\r\nago by Mr. John Elder, in a paper read before the United Service\r\nInstitution, and carried out by Admiral Popoff, of the Russian navy, who\r\ndesigned one which was afterwards constructed and was christened the\r\n_Novgorod_. She was 100 feet in diameter, with curved deck, the highest\r\npoint of which was only five or six feet above the water. She carried two\r\n28-ton guns. Its model might be described as a floating saucer with a\r\ncomparatively flat covering. It is even asserted that a good speed is\r\nattainable with such vessels, and that they are steerable, if hydraulic\r\nmachinery is employed. Mr. Elder’s plan was as follows:—When a revolving\r\npilot-house on the vessel turned, a jet of water was ejected in a backward\r\nline to the very course proposed to steer. The pilot or steersman—having a\r\ncomplete control of the movements of the pilot-house, and a clear look out\r\na-head—only arranged to steer in a particular direction, and the water jet\r\npropelled the vessel to its destination. Such vessels are fit for nothing\r\nbetter than river or harbour protection.\r\n\r\nThe _Alexandra_, whose batteries we show on the opposite page, is one of\r\nthe most efficient of our English armour-plated ships. She was built at\r\nChatham, and launched in 1875. She was specially built for speed, and\r\ncarries the maximum weight of armour consistent with sea-going qualities.\r\nShe is armed with three guns of twenty-five tons each and nine of eighteen\r\ntons.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: SECTION OF THE “ALEXANDRA.”]\r\n\r\nA new form of ironclad, destined for coast duty, has also been introduced\r\nin Holland and France. These Governments consider that for the defence of\r\na coast-line, fixed land batteries are not sufficient. They have,\r\ntherefore, adopted a ponderous form of turreted ironclad, which the French\r\nterm _garde-côtes_. They are not supposed to be adapted for long sea\r\nvoyages, as they are veritable floating iron castles, carrying not merely\r\nheavy guns, but whole batteries of smaller guns. They have good engine\r\npower, and can, therefore, be moved to any part of the coast with ease.\r\n\r\nThe cost of ironclads to this country has been very serious. Mr. Reed puts\r\nit down at a million sterling a year since their inauguration.(46) For the\r\neighteen years preceding 1876, they cost £16,738,935, and with the cost of\r\nwear and tear, repair, and maintenance, not less than £18,000,000.\r\n£300,000 was required for repairs and maintenance alone in one year,\r\nperhaps an exceptional case. The _Warrior_, built in the year 1860, cost,\r\nto 1876, for maintenance and repair, no less than £124,245, or about a\r\nthird of her original cost. She is the earliest type of ironclad, and of\r\nsmall tonnage compared with several of her successors. What _they_ may\r\ncost to maintain is a still more serious problem. Single ironclads have\r\ncost the country half a million sterling; the _Inflexible_, £600,000.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: PREPARING FOR TORPEDO EXPERIMENTS AT PORTSMOUTH.]\r\n\r\nConnected intimately with the ironclad question is the torpedo movement.\r\nFrom an early date schemes have been devised for injuring an enemy’s\r\nvessel by submarine apparatus and otherwise than by guns. In the\r\nseventeenth century, we find the celebrated Marquis of Worcester\r\ndescribing such apparatus. The ninth of his “Century of Inventions”\r\ndescribes a small engine, portable in one’s pocket, which might be carried\r\nand fastened on the inside of the ship, and at any appointed time, days or\r\nweeks after, at the will of the operator, it should explode and sink that\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nIn his tenth invention, the Marquis of Worcester describes “a way from a\r\nmile off to dive and fasten a like engine to any ship, so as it may\r\npunctually work the same effect, either for time or execution.” The\r\ndetails of construction and working are left to the reader’s imagination.\r\n\r\nBishop Wilkins, in a curious work on “Mathematical Magick,” published in\r\n1648, describes a possible submarine vessel, or “ark,” as he terms it. He\r\nsays that it “may be effected beyond all question, because one Cornelius\r\nDreble hath already experimented on it here in England.” Of Dreble very\r\nlittle is known; but it is on record that he constructed a subaqueous\r\nboat, which he exhibited before James I., which carried twelve rowers and\r\nsome passengers, and further, that that monarch was so pleased with it\r\nthat he sent a duplicate as a present to the grand Duke of Muscovy\r\n(Russia). The bishop discusses the matter very fully. The boat is, of\r\ncourse, to be watertight, all openings being sealed for the nonce by\r\nleather bags, with two sets of fastenings. The oars were to project also\r\nthrough leather bags, giving freedom of motion and yet excluding the\r\nwater. A serious difficulty—the lack of fresh air on board—is partially\r\nslurred over; but he considers that the sailors, “by long use and\r\ncustome,” will practically get used to it. The raising or lowering of the\r\nvessel is to be accomplished by the lifting or depression of an enormous\r\nstone hung to its keel. He considered that the steering would be easier\r\nthan on the surface, there being no contrary winds or atmospheric\r\ndisturbances to interfere. The vessel is to be well manned by artisans,\r\nand children are to be born in the “ark:” one of the points specially\r\nmentioned being their inevitable astonishment when they for the first time\r\nbehold the light of day at the surface, and are landed on _terra firma_!\r\nThe log is not merely to be written but is to be printed on board. “Among\r\nthe many conveniences of such a contrivance, it may be of very great\r\nadvantage against a navy of enemies, who, by this means, may be undermined\r\nin the water and blown up.”\r\n\r\nAnother old writer, Schott, in a rare and curious work, entitled\r\n“Mirabilia Mechanica,” offers several schemes for submarine vessels, and\r\ngives a drawing of one with a paddle-wheel as the propelling power. The\r\nwheel, worked by men, was to work in a watertight box in the centre of the\r\nvessel, the paddles projecting below the keel. A Frenchman built a vessel\r\nof this description at Rotterdam in 1653, and publicly exhibited it.\r\nPepys, in his “Diary,” writes, on the 14th of March, 1662: “This afternoon\r\ncame the German Dr. Knuffler, to discourse with us about his engine to\r\nblow up ships. We doubted not the matter of fact—it being tried in\r\nCromwell’s time—but the safety of carrying them in ships; but he do tell\r\nus that when he comes to tell the King his secret (for none but kings\r\nsuccessively, and their heirs, must know it) it will appear of no danger\r\nat all.” We have before described Fulton’s submarine boat, the _Nautilus_,\r\nand his torpedo experiments in France and England; let us now follow him\r\nto the New World.\r\n\r\nFulton arrived in America in December, 1806, and so far from being\r\ndiscouraged by the apathy displayed towards his inventions in Europe,\r\ninaugurated fresh experiments, under Government sanction, a certain\r\nexpenditure being authorised. An amusing account of one of his semi-public\r\nexhibitions is given by his biographer:(47)—“In the meantime, anxious to\r\nprepossess his countrymen with a good opinion of his project, he invited\r\nthe magistracy of New York and a number of citizens to Governor’s Island,\r\nwhere were the torpedoes and the machinery with which his experiments were\r\nto be made; these, with the manner in which they were to be used and were\r\nexpected to operate, he explained very fully. While he was lecturing on\r\nhis blank torpedoes, which were large empty copper cylinders, his numerous\r\nauditors crowded round him. At length he turned to a copper case of the\r\nsame description, which was placed under the gateway of the fort, and to\r\nwhich was attached a clockwork lock. This, by drawing out a peg, he set in\r\nmotion, and then said to his attentive audience, ‘Gentlemen, this is a\r\ncharged torpedo, with which, precisely in its present state, I mean to\r\nblow up a vessel; it contains one hundred and seventy pounds of gunpowder,\r\nand if I were to suffer the clockwork to run fifteen minutes, I have no\r\ndoubt but that it would blow this fortification to atoms!’ The circle\r\nround Mr. Fulton was very soon much enlarged, and before five of the\r\nfifteen minutes were out there were but two or three persons remaining\r\nunder the gateway; some, indeed, lost no time in getting at the greatest\r\npossible distance from the torpedo with their best speed, and did not\r\nagain appear on the ground till they were assured it was lodged in the\r\nmagazine.” Fulton, of course, displayed the utmost coolness, knowing that\r\nhis torpedo could not explode till the clockwork had run its allotted\r\ntime, and of course taking care that it should be stopped long before the\r\nexpiration of the fifteen minutes.\r\n\r\nOn the 20th of July, 1807, he attempted to blow up with torpedoes, in the\r\nharbour of New York, a large hulk brig which had been provided for the\r\npurpose. Several unsuccessful attempts were made at first, owing to some\r\nderangements connected with the locks of the exploding apparatus. At\r\nlength, however, the explosion took place, and was a thorough success. He\r\nhas left a full account of it in his own work.(48) Nothing was left of the\r\nbrig; all that was seen in her place was a high column of water, smoke,\r\nand fragments. It showed, as Fulton always believed, that the torpedo\r\nshould, if possible, be exploded _under_ the vessel to be blown up. In his\r\ncool but yet enthusiastic way he says: “Should a ship of the line\r\ncontaining five hundred men contend with ten good row-boats, each with a\r\ntorpedo and ten men, she would risk total annihilation, while the boats,\r\nunder the cover of the night and quick movements, would risk only a few\r\nmen out of one hundred.”\r\n\r\nFulton, after this, lectured frequently before the members of Congress,\r\nand so favourably impressed them that a sum of 5,000 dollars was voted in\r\naid of his experiments. One of the plans he proposed was to couple by a\r\nline two torpedoes, then letting them drift on the bow of the vessel to be\r\ndestroyed, the line would catch on the cable or bows, and the torpedoes\r\nwould drift towards the vessel on either side. He also proposed “block\r\nships” of 50 or 100 tons, with cannon-proof sides and musket-proof decks\r\n(_i.e._, virtually ironclads), to be propelled by machinery, _which was to\r\nbe worked by the crew_. “On each quarter and bow she was to be armed with\r\na torpedo fastened to a long spar, the interior end of which was to be\r\nsupported and braced by ropes from the yards.... By means of these spars\r\nthe torpedoes were to be thrust under the bottom of the vessel to be\r\ndestroyed.” Half the many plans proposed for torpedo warfare may be traced\r\nback to Robert Fulton at the end of the last and beginning of the present\r\ncentury. Among his inventions was a “cable-cutting machine,” a description\r\nof which would occupy an undue amount of space in a popular work. Suffice\r\nit to say that by its means he succeeded in cutting, several feet below\r\nthe surface of the water, the cable—a 14-inch one—of a vessel lying at\r\nanchor.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important experiments made at this time was his attempt,\r\nunder sanction of Government, to blow up the sloop-of-war _Argus_, and the\r\ncase demonstrates very clearly the ingenuity of the _defence_, and the\r\nmeans taken to foil the assailing torpedo. We have heard quite recently of\r\npropositions to defend a vessel by means of a kind of “crinoline,” as it\r\nhas been termed, a strong network, &c., surrounding the whole or a part of\r\nthe vessel at some distance from it, which should prevent the torpedo from\r\nexploding near the hull. Such was actually the means devised by Commodore\r\nRodgers, of the United States Navy, in the year 1809, and which proved\r\nentirely successful in foiling Fulton’s torpedo. Colden says:—“She had a\r\nstrong netting suspended from her spritsail-yard, which was anchored at\r\nthe bottom; she was surrounded by spars lashed together, which floated on\r\nthe surface of the water, so as to place her completely in a pen; she had\r\ngrappling-irons and heavy pieces of the same metal suspended from her\r\nyards and rigging, ready to be plunged in any boat that came beneath them;\r\nshe had great swords, or scythes, fastened to the ends of long spars,\r\nmoving like sweeps, which unquestionably would have mowed off as many\r\nheads as came within their reach.”\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE OLD STYLE AND THE NEW (A THREE-DECKER AND A TORPEDO\r\n                                 BOAT).]\r\n\r\nBy these devices the torpedo-boat was unable to get near the _Argus_,\r\nwhile the netting, anchored to the bottom of the harbour, prevented any\r\nprobability of the torpedo being fired under the vessel. The Government\r\nhad practically said to Fulton, “Do your best, and we’ll do our best to\r\ndefeat you.” The experiment was not one-sided, as are so many. Fulton, far\r\nfrom complaining, thus wrote: “I will do justice to the talents of\r\nCommodore Rodgers. The nets, booms, kentledge, and grapnels which he\r\narranged around the _Argus_ made a formidable appearance against one\r\ntorpedo-boat and eight bad oarsmen. I was taken unawares. I had explained\r\nto the officers of the navy my means of attack; they did not inform me of\r\ntheir means of defence. The nets were put down to the ground, otherwise I\r\nshould have sent the torpedoes under them. In this situation, the means\r\nwith which I was provided being imperfect, insignificant, and inadequate\r\nto the effect to be produced, I might be compared to what the inventor of\r\ngunpowder would have appeared had he lived in the time of Julius Cæsar,\r\nand presented himself before the gates of Rome with a four-pounder, and\r\nhad endeavoured to convince the Roman people that by means of such\r\nmachines he could batter down their walls. They would have told him that a\r\nfew catapultas casting arrows and stones upon his men would cause them to\r\nretreat; that a shower of rain would destroy his ill-guarded powder; and\r\nthe Roman centurions, who would have been unable to conceive the various\r\nmodes in which gunpowder has since been used to destroy the then art of\r\nwar, would very naturally conclude that it was a useless invention; while\r\nthe manufacturers of catapultas, bows, arrows, and shields would be the\r\nmost vehement against further experiments.”\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: LIEUT. CUSHING’S ATTACK ON THE “ALBEMARLE.”]\r\n\r\nTorpedoes were used extensively during the civil war in America, but\r\nalmost entirely for rivers or harbour defence. One of the most prominent\r\nexamples was the following:—The ironclad ram _Albemarle_(49) had been\r\ncarrying all before it, till Lieutenant Cushing, a brave young officer,\r\nscarcely twenty-one years of age, took a steam-launch, equipped as a\r\ntorpedo-boat, on the night of October, 1864, up the Roanoake River. He had\r\nwith him thirteen men. The launch was steered directly for the ironclad,\r\nwhich lay at one of the wharfs of Plymouth, protected by a raft of logs\r\nextending thirty feet. The enemy’s fire was at once very severe, but the\r\ntorpedo-boat went bravely on, and succeeded in pressing in the logs a few\r\nfeet. Cushing, in his despatch, says—“The torpedo was exploded at the same\r\ntime that the _Albemarle’s_ gun was fired. A shot seemed to go crashing\r\nthrough my boat, and a dense mass of water rushed in from the torpedo,\r\nfilling and completely disabling her. The enemy then continued to fire at\r\nfifteen feet range, and demanded our surrender, which I twice refused.”\r\nCushing leaped into the water and, with one of his party, made good his\r\nescape. The rest of the little crew were either captured, killed, or\r\nwounded. The object of the attack was, however, successful, and the\r\n_Albemarle_ was found to be a complete wreck. Torpedoes were also employed\r\nwith great effect by the Paraguayans in their war against the Brazilians\r\nin 1866.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: PARAGUAYAN TORPEDO BLOWING UP A BRAZILIAN IRONCLAD.]\r\n\r\nGreat are the varieties of torpedoes invented at various times in late\r\nyears, and a technical description of them, which would be wearying to the\r\nreader, would fill a large volume. An ingenious kind, known as the “Lay”\r\ntorpedo, after the name of its inventor, comes from the New World. It is\r\nof cylindrical form, with conical ends, the forward cone calculated to\r\nhold a hundred pounds of some explosive substance—dynamite,(50) probably,\r\nbeing used. A forward section of the main cylinder holds a powerful gas,\r\ncondensed into _liquid_ form, and used as the motive power, and connected\r\nwith the machinery by a valve operated by electricity. The torpedo has a\r\ncable coiled as harpoon-ropes are arranged in whaling-vessels, which may\r\nbe of any length, the wires connected with the battery following its\r\ncourse. This instrument of destruction is entirely under the control of\r\nthe operator, who may be stationed with his small portable battery on the\r\nshore or on a vessel. It is said that they have been sent out half a mile\r\nand brought back to the starting-point at a rate of twelve miles an hour,\r\nand that the rapidity and precision with which the machine obeyed the\r\noperator demonstrated them to be among the most formidable weapons ever\r\ninvented for naval warfare.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: _Porter Torpedo Boat. Fulton’s Torpedo Boat._\r\n          _ Spar Torpedo. (Front and Side Views.) Lay Torpedo._\r\n                      DIFFERENT FORMS OF TORPEDOES.]\r\n\r\nThese subaqueous weapons have never been used in an engagement between\r\nfleets. In an interesting essay(51) on the subject by Commander Noel,\r\nR.N., he recommends or proposes that four torpedo vessels should accompany\r\na fleet, and describes their probable operations as follows:—\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: TORPEDO EXPERIMENTS AT PORTSMOUTH, WITH THE ELECTRIC\r\n                                 LIGHT.]\r\n\r\n“Let us imagine ourselves, then, on board a rakish little craft, fitted\r\nfor Harvey torpedo work; we can steam sixteen knots; we tow a torpedo on\r\neach quarter; and we are so admirably fitted with steel-protecting\r\nmantelets that neither officer nor man is exposed either to view or to\r\nrifle fire. Our instructions are that on the approach of a hostile force\r\nwe and our three consorts are to hold ourselves in readiness to charge the\r\nenemy’s line, passing through at full speed, and doing all the damage that\r\nlies in our power: these orders to be carried into effect in obedience to\r\na preconcerted signal. The enemy is observed approaching, and apparently\r\nmoving at about ten knots’ speed. The torpedo vessels are let loose, and,\r\nchoosing the centre of the enemy’s fleet, rush on, steering for a\r\nflag-ship leading a column in line ahead. Heavy guns are fired at us as we\r\nnear, but we are so small and rapid in our movements that no shot takes\r\neffect; we are reducing our distance at the rate of a mile in two and a\r\nhalf minutes; soon comes the time of suspense; in a second or two we are\r\npassing the flag-ship; the port torpedo is dipped—will it strike her?\r\nSuddenly a tug on the wire towing-rope, and it parts. Her bow has been\r\nprotected, and our torpedo is torn away harmless. However, another mine\r\ntows on the opposite quarter, still in working order; we are in the midst\r\nof the enemy’s fleet, rushing past one after another at half-minute\r\nintervals; our only chance of using our other torpedo is in breaking\r\nthrough the line; our commander is eminent for his skill, courage, and\r\nconfidence. Little choice is given us, but he observes a rather great\r\ninterval astern of the fourth ship. ‘Starboard’ is the order, and we break\r\nthrough under her stern; our starboard torpedo is at the same time dipped,\r\nand passes under the fifth ship. Owing to a combination of luck and good\r\nmanagement, the torpedo takes effect and the enemy is blown up. The other\r\ntorpedo vessels have thrown the enemy into considerable disorder, but none\r\nhave succeeded in using their torpedoes with effect. One of them has been\r\nstruck by a heavy shell and totally disabled, but the whole fleet has\r\npassed on without finding it possible to capture or sink her without\r\nlosing their position in station and being left behind; the thought\r\nforemost in every captain’s mind also being that the enemy’s fleet is\r\nalmost in contact with them, and that the moment to act has arrived.\r\n\r\n“This is an example of an attack with ‘Harvey’ torpedoes from ahead and\r\nacross the bow.... In my opinion, it would invariably be rendered\r\nfruitless if the bows of the ships attacked were protected by an iron\r\nframework of the simplest description.\r\n\r\n“But let us return to our little craft, in which we have already run the\r\ngauntlet of the hostile fleet. Having cleared the enemy with little or no\r\ndamage, we look back and see our fleet of ironclads breaking through their\r\nlines, which have been so shaken by our assault. When through, our fleet\r\nre-forms and wheels for the next charge. We must be at work again; our\r\ntorpedoes are replaced, and everything is in working order. This time we\r\nfollow our ironclads to the charge. We are, if anything, more hopeful of\r\nsuccess. The enemy will not see us till we are at them; our blood is\r\nwarming to the work, and we feel that we have gained experience and\r\nconfidence by the first charge. Pressing on, we observe the second charge\r\nof the fleet, amidst smoke, confusion, and thundering of cannon. The enemy\r\nis prepared, and it is a case of ‘Greek meeting Greek.’ Our vessel is put\r\nat full speed, and, with our consorts (now reduced to two), we go at the\r\nenemy. However, in the charge that is made only one of us succeeds in\r\nexploding a torpedo, and that without much damage to the enemy; one of our\r\nconsorts is run down and sunk, and we pass through, only dipping one\r\ntorpedo, and that too late to take effect. The enemy are not in the steady\r\nline they were in before, and consequently we have not such an opportunity\r\nof creating disorder, and have more difficulty in manœuvring to use our\r\nweapon. Passing on, fortune still favours us. We come across an enemy\r\ndisabled, stern on to us with her ensign flying. ‘At her!’ is the order.\r\nAnother moment and we are close to her, our torpedo in beautiful position,\r\nand the enemy helpless. Down comes her ensign, just in time; we are able\r\nto let go the torpedo so as to clear her—now a lawful prize.\r\n\r\n“So it is that I believe a torpedo vessel will be handled in an action. It\r\nwill be ticklish work; and all I can say is that the men who undertake it\r\nshould be gifted with coolness and courage above their fellows, as well as\r\nwith the utmost proficiency in handling their vessels.”\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most formidable _ocean-going_ torpedo vessel yet constructed\r\nis the American despatch-vessel _Alarm_, designed by Admiral David Porter,\r\nof the United States Navy. It is 172 feet long, including a ram of\r\ntwenty-seven feet in length. One of her special qualities is the power of\r\nlaunching torpedoes from almost any point, from cylinders specially\r\nconstructed for the purpose, that at the bow being thirty-two feet in\r\nlength. A torpedo-boat, built by the Messrs. Yarrow, of Poplar, for the\r\nRussian Government during the late war, appears to have special merits. It\r\nis built of light steel, with what is called a “whale-back”—a\r\nsemi-circular covering, which resists any ordinary shot and throws off any\r\nsea whatever. The funnel is not in the centre, but towards the side, in\r\norder not to interfere with the steersman’s view nor with the torpedo\r\nboom. It has a boom which can be lowered in the water, the torpedo being\r\nsubmerged ten feet before it is started off on its deadly errand. And,\r\nfinally, it can be projected from the stern, which gives it a splendid\r\nchance of leaving before the final explosion.\r\n\r\nIn the late Turko-Russian war torpedoes were often attached to logs of\r\nwood or clumps of brushwood, and floated into the stream of the Danube.\r\nThese often attracted little attention; and when they came into contact\r\nwith any obstacle the mine exploded by means of percussion, the blow being\r\ndelivered by a projecting arm or other contrivance driven back upon some\r\ndetonating substance within. The Harvey torpedo, one of the leading types,\r\nconsists of a stout wooden casing, strengthened on the outside with iron\r\nstraps, and containing a metal shell, which holds the powder charge. The\r\nlargest size of this weapon measures 4 feet 6 inches in length by 2 feet\r\nin depth, and 2 feet 6 inches in width, and carries 100 lbs. of dynamite.\r\nThe torpedo is fired by being brought into hugging contact with an enemy’s\r\nship, when one or other of two projecting levers acts upon an exploding\r\nbolt causing the ignition of the charge. The exploding apparatus consists\r\nof a tube containing a chemical agent and a bulb holding another. The\r\nnature of these chemicals is such that when they combine violent\r\ncombustion ensues, which explodes the charge. These torpedoes are towed at\r\nthe end of a long hawser, connected to a spar, so arranged that the\r\ntorpedo itself, instead of following immediately in the wake or trail of\r\nthe vessel towing it, diverges in the same manner that an otter float\r\ndoes: from which device Captain Harvey took his idea. Attached to the\r\ntorpedo are two large buoys, for the purpose of supporting it when the\r\nvessel is not moving through the water, or when the towing-line is\r\nslackened. Another variety is fired by electricity.\r\n\r\nThe Whitehead, or “fish” torpedo, is a cigar-shaped steel cylinder 14 to\r\n19 feet in length, and from 14 to 16 inches in diameter. It is sent off,\r\nrequiring no crew, against the ship to be destroyed; and if one torpedo\r\nfails to deal the death-blow it can be followed up by another, or yet a\r\nthird. It consists of three compartments. The head contains the\r\nexplosive—say 360 lbs. of gun-cotton; the centre holds the machinery; and\r\nthe tail the highly-condensed air which works the engine. The engine is\r\nabout thirty-five pounds weight, and can be worked to forty horse power!\r\nThe explanation of this is simply that the working pressure of the\r\ncondensed air is 1,000 lbs. per square inch. The tail holds compressed air\r\nsufficient to propel the torpedo 200 yards, at a rate of twenty-five miles\r\nan hour, or 1,000 yards at the rate of seventeen miles.\r\n\r\nThe “battle of the guns” has not yet been fought; but how about the rams?\r\nThey have been proved the deadliest weapons of destruction in modern\r\ntimes. The lessons of Lissa have been already cited in these pages; so\r\nhave the lessons taught by the loss of the _Vanguard_ and the _Grosser\r\nKurfurst_. In the latter cases it was friends that struck the blow. Some\r\nof our greatest authorities consider that nothing can exceed the power of\r\nthe ram of a modern ironclad, properly applied. Admiral Touchard, of the\r\nFrench Navy, says: “The ‘beak’ (_i.e._ ‘ram’) is now the principal weapon\r\nin naval combats—the _ultima ratio_ of maritime war.” Captain Colomb, a\r\ndistinguished English authority, says: “Let us just recall the fact that\r\nthe serious part of a future naval attack does not appear to be the guns,\r\nbut the rams.” Yet again another authority, Captain Pellew, says: “Rams\r\nare the arm of naval warfare to which I attach the chief importance. In my\r\nopinion, the aim of all manœuvring and preliminary practice with the guns\r\nshould be to get a fair opportunity for ramming.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                CHAPTER X.\r\n\r\n\r\n                     THE LIGHTHOUSE AND ITS HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n        The Lighthouse—Our most noted one in Danger—The Eddystone\r\n       Undermined—The Ancient History of Lighthouses—The Pharos of\r\n     Alexandria—Roman Light Towers at Boulogne and Dover—Fire-beacons\r\n         and Pitch-pots—The Tower of Cordouan—The First Eddystone\r\n       Lighthouse—Winstanley and his Eccentricities—Difficulties of\r\n      Building his Wooden Structure—Resembles a Pagoda—The Structure\r\n         Swept Away with its Inventor—Another Silk Mercer in the\r\n         Field—Rudyerd’s Lighthouse—Built of Wood—Stood for Fifty\r\n    Years—Creditable Action of Louis XIV.—Lighthouse Keeper alone with\r\n       a Corpse—The Horrors of a Month—Rudyerd’s Tower destroyed by\r\n        Fire—Smeaton’s Early History—Employed to Build the Present\r\n     Eddystone—Resolves on a Stone Tower—Employment of “Dove-tailing”\r\n     in Masonry—Difficulties of Landing on the Rock—Peril incurred by\r\n    the Workmen—The First Season’s Work—Smeaton always in the Post of\r\n           Danger—Watching the Rock from Plymouth Hoe—The Last\r\n       Season—Vibrations of the Tower in a Storm—Has Stood for 120\r\n     Years—Joy of the Mariner when “The Eddystone’s in Sight!”—Lights\r\n                         in the English Channel.\r\n\r\n\r\n                              [Illustration]\r\n\r\nRound the history of ships and shipping interests innumerable subjects\r\nintertwine. But for the good ship, we should not need coast\r\nfortifications, grand breakwaters, and artificial harbours, lighthouses,\r\nlifeboats, and coast-guard organisations. Just as England stands\r\npre-eminent on the sea, so in all subsidiary points connected therewith\r\nshe is fully represented. To the lighthouse and its history attention is\r\nnow invited.\r\n\r\nNot long since many an anxious eye was turned Channelwards from Plymouth\r\nHoe towards that group of rocks, on one of which the famous Eddystone\r\nLight stood—and happily, still stands—for the light that should have\r\nillumined the stormy waters was apparently quenched. Not till morning dawn\r\nhad nearly come was a re-assuring glimmer noted in the lantern of that\r\nfamed Pharos of our coasts. And there was good reason for anxiety,\r\nalthough the immediate occasion was a mere temporary derangement of the\r\nlighting apparatus: for the report had spread that Smeaton’s greatest\r\narchitectural triumph had collapsed before the power of the sea. One\r\ntrembles to think what that might have meant, not merely to its few\r\ninhabitants, but to scores of sailors and owners. “Happily,” said one of\r\nour leading journals, “the Eddystone is still safe, despite the terrible\r\neffects of winds and waves, and the serious weakness of its own\r\nfoundations, which was discovered a few years ago. For the tower which\r\nlights the way of the sailor into Plymouth Sound is, after all, not so\r\nsecure a structure as could be desired. Built of solid masonry and with\r\nimmense skill, by the clever architect from Hull who designed and carried\r\nout the work, it had yet to trust for its foundation to the rock upon\r\nwhich it stood. Should that give way the stone-work of the edifice might\r\nbe strong enough, and yet some day fall into hopeless ruin. Strange to\r\nsay, this very weakness has been self-revealed. The rock upon which the\r\nlighthouse stands, and which, of the twenty-three that comprise the group,\r\nis most exposed to the action of the sea, has been so violently attacked\r\nby what Ovid calls the ‘insane waters’ as to have become very seriously\r\nundermined. Gradually the waves have cut away the foundations of the\r\nstone, rising now and then against the lighthouse, and pressing against\r\nthe structure with such force as to make the building itself serve the\r\nturn of a crowbar, and so, little by little, creating fissures in the\r\nfoundations, and gradually preparing the way to the end.” Many attempts\r\nhave been made to obviate these evils by the removal of rock which it was\r\nsupposed acted as a lever to the water, and by other means: but in vain.\r\nAt length the Board of Trinity House finding their efforts futile,\r\ndetermined to erect another lighthouse. Meantime, a light-ship has been\r\nprovided, which, in case of accident to Smeaton’s tower, will be moored in\r\nthe neighbourhood. A larger building is now in course of erection on an\r\nadjacent rock, which affords a more durable foundation and is less exposed\r\nto the merciless waves. It will be nearly double the height of the older\r\nstructure, which was seventy-two feet high, and is being built on a\r\nprinciple of dovetailing, which, it is hoped and believed, will secure it\r\nagainst the worst fury of the sea. Think what that fury is sometimes,\r\ngentle reader! At the Skerryvore Rock they have an apparatus for\r\nregistering the power of the waves per square foot surface; once recently\r\nit registered _three tons_ to the foot!\r\n\r\nThe most noted lighthouse in the world was undoubtedly the Pharos of\r\nAlexandria, named from the island on which it stood. The French, Italians,\r\nand Spaniards to-day use the term almost in its original purity: thus,\r\nFrench for lighthouse, _phare_; Italian and Spanish, _faro_. It was\r\ncommenced by the first Ptolemy, and finished about 280 B.C., the\r\nworkmanship, according to all accounts, being superb. This tower of white\r\nstone was 400 feet high. It is stated by Josephus that the light, which\r\nwas always kept burning on its top at night, was visible over forty miles.\r\nIt is believed to have been destroyed by an earthquake, though the date of\r\nits destruction is unknown.\r\n\r\nThe Romans were the first to erect anything approaching a Pharos, or\r\nlighthouse, on our coasts. Beacon fires may have been occasionally used\r\nbefore; the conquerors made the matter an organised affair. On either side\r\nthe Channel, at Boulogne and Dover, structures of no mean altitude were\r\nraised for this purpose. That at Boulogne is supposed to have been erected\r\nby Caligula; all vestiges of it have passed away. It was originally called\r\n_Turris Ardens_, afterwards corrupted to the _Tour d’Ordre_. From a\r\ndescription left by Claude Châtillon, engineer to Henry IV., it appears\r\nthat it was built about a stone’s throw from the edge of the cliff, above\r\nand overlooking the high tower and the castle. Its form was octagonal,\r\nwith a base 192 feet in circumference. It was built of grey stone with\r\nthin red bricks between. That at Dover still exists. It occupies the\r\nhighest point of the lofty rock on which the famous castle is built. This\r\nPharos was also octagonal in outward form, being square within. It is 33\r\nfeet in diameter, and formerly about 72 feet high. On the summit three\r\nholes on the three exterior sides indicate their purposes, both for\r\nlook-out and for exhibiting a light seawards.\r\n\r\nLong after, and indeed almost down to our days, fire-beacons were far more\r\ncommon on exposed parts of our coasts than lighthouses. “The first idea of\r\na lighthouse,” said Faraday, “is the candle in the cottage window, guiding\r\nthe husband across the water or the pathless moor.” Lambarde says of the\r\nlights shown along the coast that, “Before the time of Edward III., they\r\nwere made of great stacks of wood; but about the eleventh yeere of his\r\nraigne it was ordained that in our shyre (Kent) they should be high\r\nstandards with their pitchpots.” Such were long used.\r\n\r\nLighthouses in these days differ greatly in material and mode of\r\nconstruction. Stone, brick, cast and wrought iron, and even wood, are\r\nused, according to the necessities of the case, or the lacks of the\r\nspecial locality where they are placed. In the case of some iron\r\nlighthouses they are literally screwed into the rock or hard ground.\r\nSeventy of this class of structures now exist in the United States.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: THE TOWER OF CORDOUAN.]\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable early lighthouses is the Tower of Cordouan,\r\nsituated on a ledge of rocks at the mouth of the Garonne, which empties\r\ninto the Bay of Biscay. It was commenced in 1584, and completed in 1610,\r\nby Louis de Foix.\r\n\r\nThe ledge is about 3,000 feet long and 1,500 feet broad, and is bare at\r\nlow water. It is surrounded by detached rocks, upon which the sea breaks\r\nwith terrific violence. There is but one place of access, which is a\r\npassage 300 feet wide, where there are no rocks, and which leads to within\r\n600 feet of the tower. The tower was a circular cone, rising from its\r\nrocky base to a height of 162 feet. It is now shorter. The apartments of\r\nthe tower are highly ornamented, consisting of four storeys, all of\r\ndifferent orders of architecture, and adorned with busts and statues of\r\nKings of France and heathen gods. The basement, or lower storey, appears\r\nto have been intended as a store-room; the second storey is called the\r\n“King’s apartments;” the third is a chapel; and the fourth consists of a\r\ndome supported by columns, a kind of lower lantern; above this was\r\noriginally a lantern formed of a stone dome and eight columns. In the\r\nupper lantern a fire of oak wood was kept burning for about a hundred\r\nyears, when, in 1717, the fire having weakened the stone supports by\r\ncalcining them, the upper lantern was taken down, and the light was kept\r\nup in the lower lantern. As it did not show well there, an iron lantern\r\nwas erected in 1727 above this, in the place of the old stone lantern, and\r\ncoal was then used for fuel instead of wood.\r\n\r\nThe following history of the Eddystone is largely derived from one of Mr.\r\nSamuel Smiles’ graphic and learned works.(52)\r\n\r\nIn 1696, Mr. Henry Winstanley (a mercer and country gentleman), of\r\nLittlebury, in the county of Essex, obtained the necessary powers to erect\r\na lighthouse on the Eddystone. That gentleman seems to have possessed a\r\ncurious mechanical genius, which first displayed itself in devising sundry\r\npractical jokes for the entertainment of his guests. Smeaton tells us that\r\nin one room there lay an old slipper, which, if a kick was given it,\r\nimmediately raised a ghost from the floor; in another the visitor sat down\r\nupon a chair, which suddenly threw out two arms and held him a fast\r\nprisoner; whilst, in the garden, if he sought the shelter of an arbour,\r\nand sat down upon a particular seat, he was straightway set afloat in the\r\nmiddle of the adjoining canal. These tricks must have rendered the house\r\nat Littlebury a somewhat exciting residence for the uninitiated guest. The\r\namateur inventor exercised the same genius, to a certain extent, for the\r\nentertainment of the inhabitants of the metropolis, and at Hyde Park\r\nCorner he erected a variety of _jets d’eau_, known by the name of\r\nWinstanley’s Waterworks, which he exhibited at stated times at a shilling\r\na head.\r\n\r\nThis whimsicality of the man in some measure accounts for the oddity of\r\nthe wooden building erected by him on the Eddystone Rock; and it is matter\r\nof surprise that it should have stood the severe weather of the English\r\nChannel for several seasons. The building was begun in the year 1696, and\r\nfinished in four years. It must necessarily have been a work attended with\r\ngreat difficulty as well as danger, as operations could only be carried on\r\nduring fine weather, when the sea was comparatively smooth. The first\r\nsummer was wholly spent in making twelve holes in the rock, and fastening\r\ntwelve irons in them, by which to hold fast the superstructure. “Even in\r\nsummer,” Winstanley says, “the weather would at times prove so bad that\r\nfor ten or fourteen days together the sea would be so raging about these\r\nrocks, caused by out-winds and the running of the ground seas coming from\r\nthe main ocean, that although the weather should seem and be most calm in\r\nother places, yet here it would mount and fly more than two hundred feet,\r\nas has been so found since there was lodgment on the place, and therefore\r\nall our works were constantly buried at those times, and exposed to the\r\nmercy of the seas.”\r\n\r\nThe second summer was spent in making a solid pillar, twelve feet high and\r\nfourteen feet in diameter, on which to build the lighthouse. In the third\r\nyear all the upper work was erected to the vane, which was eighty feet\r\nabove the foundation. In the midsummer of that year Winstanley ventured to\r\ntake up his lodging with the workmen in the lighthouse; but a storm arose,\r\nand eleven days passed before any boats could come near them. During that\r\nperiod the sea washed in upon Winstanley and his companions, wetting all\r\ntheir clothing and provisions, and carrying off many of their materials.\r\nBy the time the boats could land, the party were reduced almost to their\r\nlast crust; but, happily, the building stood, apparently firm. Finally,\r\nthe light was exhibited on the summit of the building, on the 14th of\r\nNovember, 1698.\r\n\r\nThe fourth year was occupied in strengthening the building round the\r\nfoundations, making all solid nearly to a height of twenty feet, and also\r\nin raising the upper part of the lighthouse forty feet, to keep it well\r\nout of the wash of the sea. This timber erection, when finished, somewhat\r\nresembled a Chinese pagoda, with open galleries and numerous fantastic\r\nprojections. The main gallery, under the light, was so wide and open that\r\nan old gentleman who remembered both Winstanley and his lighthouse,\r\nafterwards told Smeaton that it was possible for a six-oared boat to be\r\nlifted up on a wave and driven clear through the open gallery into the sea\r\non the other side. In the perspective print of the lighthouse, published\r\nby the architect after its erection, he complacently represented himself\r\nas fishing out of the kitchen window!\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: WINSTANLEY’S LIGHTHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nWhen Winstanley had brought his work to completion, he is said to have\r\nexpressed himself so satisfied as to its strength that he only wished he\r\nmight be there in the fiercest storm that ever blew. In this wish he was\r\nnot disappointed, though the result was the reverse entirely of the\r\nbuilder’s anticipations. In November, 1703, Winstanley went off to the\r\nlighthouse to superintend some repairs which had become necessary, and he\r\nwas still in the place with the light-keepers, when, on the night of the\r\n26th, a storm of unparalleled fury burst along the coast. As day broke on\r\nthe morning of the 27th, people on shore anxiously looked in the direction\r\nof the rock to see if Winstanley’s structure had withstood the fury of the\r\ngale, but not a vestige of it remained. The lighthouse and its builder had\r\nbeen swept completely away.\r\n\r\nThe building had, in fact, been deficient in every element of stability,\r\nand its form was such as to render it peculiarly liable to damage from the\r\nviolence both of wind and water. “Nevertheless,” as Smeaton generously\r\nobserves, “it was no small degree of heroic merit in Winstanley to\r\nundertake a piece of work which had before been deemed impracticable, and,\r\nby the success which attended his endeavours, to show mankind that the\r\nerection of such a work was not in itself a thing of that kind.” He may,\r\nindeed, be said to have paved the way for the more successful enterprise\r\nof Smeaton himself; and its failure was not without its influence in\r\ninducing that great mechanic to exercise the care which he did, in\r\ndevising a structure that should withstand the most violent sea on the\r\nsouth coast. Shortly after Winstanley’s lighthouse had been swept away,\r\nthe _Winchelsea_, a richly laden homeward-bound Virginian, was wrecked on\r\nthe Eddystone Rock, and almost every soul on board perished; so that the\r\nerection of a lighthouse upon the dangerous reef remained as much a\r\nnecessity as ever.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: RUDYERD’S LIGHTHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nMr. Smiles graphically describes the coming architect of the period. He\r\ndid not, however, come from the class of architects or builders, or even\r\nof mechanics; and as for the class of engineers, it had not even yet\r\nsprung into existence. The projector of the next lighthouse for the\r\nEddystone was again a London mercer, who kept a silk shop on Ludgate Hill.\r\nJohn Rudyerd—for such was his name—was, however, a man of unquestionable\r\ngenius, and possessed of much force of character. He was the son of a\r\nCornish labourer, whom nobody would employ—his character was so bad; and\r\nthe rest of the family were no better, being looked upon in their\r\nneighbourhood as “a worthless set of ragged beggars.” John seems to have\r\nbeen the one sound chick in the whole brood. He had a naturally clear head\r\nand honest heart, and succeeded in withstanding the bad example of his\r\nfamily. When his brothers went out pilfering, he refused to accompany\r\nthem, and hence they regarded him as sullen and obstinate. They ill-used\r\nhim, and he ran away. Fortunately he succeeded in getting into the service\r\nof a gentleman at Plymouth, who saw something promising in his appearance.\r\nThe boy conducted himself so well in the capacity of a servant, that he\r\nwas allowed to learn reading, writing, and accounts; and he proved so\r\nquick and intelligent, that his kind master eventually placed him in a\r\nsituation where his talents could have better scope for exercise than in\r\nhis service, and he succeeded in thus laying the foundation of the young\r\nman’s success in life.\r\n\r\nWe are not informed of the steps by which Rudyerd marked his way upward,\r\nuntil we find him called from his silk-mercer’s shop to undertake the\r\nrebuilding of the Eddystone Lighthouse. But it is probable that by this\r\ntime he had become well known for his mechanical skill in design, if not\r\nin construction, as well as for his thoroughly practical and reliable\r\ncharacter as a man of business; and that for these reasons, amongst\r\nothers, he was selected to conduct this difficult and responsible\r\nundertaking.\r\n\r\nAfter the lapse of about three years from the destruction of Winstanley’s\r\nfabric, the Brothers of the Trinity, in 1706, obtained an Act of\r\nParliament enabling them to rebuild the lighthouse, with power to grant a\r\nlease to the undertaker. It was taken by one Captain Lovet for a period of\r\nninety-nine years, and he it was that found out and employed Rudyerd. His\r\ndesign of the new structure was simple but masterly. He selected the form\r\nthat offered the least possible resistance to the force of the winds and\r\nthe waves, avoiding the open galleries and projections of his predecessor.\r\nInstead of a polygon he chose a cone for the outline of his building, and\r\nhe carried up the elevation in that form. In the practical execution of\r\nthe work he was assisted by two shipwrights from the king’s yard at\r\nWoolwich, who worked with him during the whole time he was occupied in the\r\nerection.\r\n\r\nThe main defect of the lighthouse consisted of the faultiness of the\r\nmaterial of which it was built; for, like Winstanley’s, it was of wood.\r\nThe means employed to fix the work to its foundation proved quite\r\nefficient; dove-tailed holes were cut out of the rock, into which strong\r\niron bolts or branches were keyed, and the interstices were afterwards\r\nfilled with molten pewter. To these branches were firmly fixed a crown of\r\nsquared oak balks, across these a set of shorter balks, and so on till a\r\nbasement of solid wood was raised, the whole being firmly fitted and tied\r\ntogether with tre-nails and screw-bolts. At the same time, to increase the\r\nweight and vertical pressure of the building, and thereby present a\r\ngreater resistance to any disturbing forces, Rudyerd introduced numerous\r\ncourses of Cornish moorstone, as well jointed as possible, and cramped\r\nwith iron. It is not necessary to follow the details of the construction\r\nfurther than to state that outside the solid timber and stone courses\r\nstrong upright timbers were fixed, and carried up as the work proceeded,\r\nbinding the whole firmly together. Within these upright timbers the rooms\r\nof the lighthouse were formed, the floor of the lowest—the\r\nstore-room—being situated twenty-seven feet above the highest side of the\r\nrock. The upper part of the building comprehended four rooms, one above\r\nanother, chiefly formed by the upright outside timbers, scarfed—that is,\r\nthe ends overlapping, and firmly fastened together. The whole building\r\nwas, indeed, an admirable piece of ship-carpentry, excepting only the\r\nmoorstone, which was merely introduced, as it were, by way of ballast. The\r\nouter timbers were tightly caulked with oakum, like a ship, and the whole\r\nwas payed over with pitch. Upon the roof of the main column Rudyerd fixed\r\nhis lantern, which was lit by candles, seventy feet above the highest side\r\nof the foundation, which was of a sloping form. From its lowest side to\r\nthe summit of the ball fixed on the top of the building was ninety-two\r\nfeet, the timber column resting on a base of twenty-three feet four\r\ninches. “The whole building,” says Smeaton, “consisted of a simple figure,\r\nbeing an elegant frustum of a cone, unbroken by any projecting ornaments,\r\nor anything whereon the violence of the storm could lay hold.” The\r\nstructure was completely finished in 1709, though the light was exhibited\r\nin the lantern as early as the 28th of July, 1706.\r\n\r\nThat the building erected by Rudyerd was, on the whole, well adapted for\r\nthe purpose for which it was intended, was proved by the fact that it\r\nserved as a lighthouse for ships navigating the English Channel for nearly\r\nfifty years. The lighthouse was at first attended by only two men. It\r\nhappened, however, that one of the keepers was taken ill and died, and\r\nonly one man remained to do the work. He signalled for assistance, but the\r\nweather prevented any boat from reaching the rock for nearly a month.\r\nWhat, then, was the surviving man to do with the dead body of his comrade?\r\nThe thought struck him that if he threw it into the sea, he might be\r\ncharged with murder. He determined, therefore, to keep the corpse in the\r\nlighthouse until a boat should come off from the shore. At last a boat\r\ncame off, but the weather was still so rough that a landing was only\r\neffected with the greatest difficulty. By this time the effluvia from the\r\ncorpse was overpowering; it filled the apartments of the lighthouse, and\r\nthe men were compelled to dispose of the body by throwing it into the sea.\r\nIn future three men were always employed.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: DESTRUCTION OF RUDYERD’S LIGHTHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nThe chief defect of Rudyerd’s building consisted of the material of which\r\nit was constructed; the necessary lights and heat proceeding from them\r\nmade it a very dangerous structure. “The immediate cause of the accident\r\nby which the lighthouse was destroyed was never ascertained. All that\r\nbecame known was, that about two o’clock in the morning of the 2nd\r\nDecember, 1755, the light-keeper on duty, going into the lantern to snuff\r\nthe candles, found it full of smoke. The lighthouse was on fire! In a few\r\nminutes the wooden fabric was in a blaze. Water could not be brought up\r\nthe tower by the men in sufficient quantities to be thrown with any effect\r\nupon the flames raging above their heads; the molten lead fell down upon\r\nthe light-keepers, into their very mouths,(53) and they fled from room to\r\nroom, the fire following them down towards the sea. From Cawsand and Rame\r\nHead the unusual glare of light proceeding from the Eddystone was seen in\r\nthe early morning, and fishing-boats, with men, went off to the rock,\r\nthough a fresh east wind was blowing. By the time they reached it, the\r\nlight-keepers had not only been driven from all the rooms, but, to protect\r\nthemselves from the molten lead and red-hot bolts and falling timbers,\r\nthey had been compelled to take shelter under a ledge of the rock on its\r\neastern side, and after considerable delay the poor fellows were taken\r\noff, more dead than alive. And thus was Rudyerd’s lighthouse also\r\ncompletely destroyed.” The Eddystone rocks being in such an exposed place,\r\nright in the way of so much shipping, it was resolved at once to rebuild\r\nthe lighthouse.\r\n\r\nPrevious to the date of the destruction of Rudyerd’s timber building,\r\nCaptain Lovet, the former lessee of the lighthouse, had died, and his\r\ninterest in it had been acquired by Mr. Robert Weston and two others.\r\nWeston immediately applied to the Earl of Macclesfield, President of the\r\nRoyal Society, who strongly recommended John Smeaton, then away in the\r\nnorth. Weston immediately wrote to him, but Smeaton, thinking apparently\r\nthat it only referred to some repairs required in the building, declined\r\nto come up, unless there was to be some degree of permanency in his\r\nengagement. The answer he received was to the effect that the building was\r\nno more; that it must be rebuilt; and concluded with the words, “thou art\r\nthe man to do it.”\r\n\r\nThe life of Smeaton is one of the most interesting to be found among “The\r\nLives of the Engineers.” He was born near Leeds, on the 8th of June, 1724,\r\nhis father being a respectable attorney, and he received an excellent\r\neducation. “Young Smeaton,” says Mr. Smiles, “was not much given to boyish\r\nsports, early displaying a thoughtfulness beyond his years. Most children\r\nare naturally fond of building up miniature fabrics, and perhaps still\r\nmore so of pulling them down. But the little Smeaton seemed to have a more\r\nthan ordinary love of contrivance, and that mainly for its own sake. He\r\nwas never so happy as when put in possession of any cutting tool, by which\r\nhe could make his little imitations of houses, pumps, and windmills. Even\r\nwhilst a boy in petticoats, he was continually drawing circles and\r\nsquares, and the only playthings in which he seemed to take any real\r\npleasure were his models of things that would ‘work.’ When any carpenters\r\nor masons were employed in the neighbourhood of his father’s house, the\r\ninquisitive boy was sure to be among them, watching the men, observing how\r\nthey handled their tools, and frequently asking them questions. His\r\nlife-long friend, Mr. Holmes, who knew him in his youth, has related, that\r\nhaving one day observed some millwrights at work, shortly after, to the\r\ngreat alarm of his family, he was seen fixing something like a windmill on\r\nthe top of his father’s barn. On another occasion, when watching some\r\nworkmen fixing a pump in the village, he was so lucky as to procure from\r\nthem a piece of bored pipe, which he succeeded in fashioning into a\r\nworking pump that actually raised water. His odd cleverness, however, does\r\nnot seem to have been appreciated; and it is told of him that amongst\r\nother boys he was known as ‘Fooly Smeaton,’ for though forward enough in\r\nputting questions to the workpeople, amongst boys of his own age he was\r\nremarkably shy, and, as they thought, stupid.” He made great progress at\r\nthe Leeds Grammar School in geometry and arithmetic, still carrying on his\r\nmechanical studies at home. It happened one day that some mechanics came\r\ninto the neighbourhood to erect a “fire-engine,” as the steam-engine was\r\nthen called, for pumping water from the Garforth coal mines. Smeaton\r\nwatched their operations, and thereupon commenced the erection of a\r\nminiature engine at home, provided with pumps and other apparatus, which\r\nhe succeeded in getting to work before the colliery engine was ready. He\r\nimmediately set it to work on one of his father’s fish-ponds, which he\r\nsucceeded in pumping completely dry, killing all the fish, much to his\r\nfather’s annoyance. By the time he had arrived at his fifteenth year, he\r\nhad contrived to make a turning-lathe, on which he turned wood and ivory,\r\nmaking little presents of boxes and other articles for his friends. His\r\nfather had destined young Smeaton for the law, but at last consented to\r\nhis son’s wish to become a mathematical instrument maker. The son came to\r\nLondon, and was soon enabled to earn enough for his own maintenance. He\r\ndid not, however, live a mere workman’s life, but frequented the society\r\nof educated men, and was a regular attendant at the meetings of the Royal\r\nSociety. We find him at the age of twenty-six reading papers before that\r\nmost learned society. He had already attempted improvements in the\r\nmariner’s compass; had invented a machine for measuring the amount of\r\n“way” on a ship at sea; and designed improvements in the air-pump, in\r\nships’ tackle, and in water and wind-mills. He had already acquired an\r\nhonourable reputation as a scientific engineer when the question of\r\nrebuilding the Eddystone Lighthouse arose.\r\n\r\nThis afforded Smeaton a grand opening for advancement, and as soon as some\r\npreliminaries were arranged, he came to town, where he studied the subject\r\nin its entirety. He soon came to the conclusion that stone was the only\r\nmaterial to employ in the construction of a lighthouse, contrary to the\r\nopinion of the Brethren of the Trinity House, who had faith in wood, and\r\nthat only. He also devised a system of dovetailing, then scarcely known in\r\nmasonry, though common enough in carpentry. All these investigations were\r\nmade before Smeaton had even paid a visit to the exposed site on which the\r\nlighthouse was to be built. It was not till March, 1756, that he set out\r\nfrom London to Plymouth, a journey which occupied him six days, on account\r\nof the badness of the roads. At Plymouth he met Josias Jessop, to whom he\r\nhad been referred for information as to the previous lighthouse. Jessop\r\nwas then a foreman of shipwrights in the dockyard, and a first-class\r\ndraughtsman, full of ingenuity and mechanical knowledge. Smeaton was very\r\nanxious to go out to the rocks at once; but the sea was so heavy that no\r\nopportunity occurred till the 2nd of April, when they were able to reach\r\nthem. The sea was breaking over the landing-place with such violence that\r\nthere was no possibility of landing. All that the enthusiastic engineer\r\ncould do was to view the cone of bare rock—the mere crest of the mountain\r\nwhose base was laid so far in the sea-deeps beneath. Three days later\r\nanother voyage was made, and he was enabled to land on the site of his\r\nfuture triumph. He stayed there more than two hours, when he was compelled\r\nby the roughness of the sea to leave the rock. Several subsequent trials\r\nwere unsuccessful. On the 22nd of the same month, after a lapse of\r\nseventeen days, Smeaton was able to effect his second landing at low\r\nwater. After a further inspection, the party retreated to their sloop,\r\nwhich lay off until the tide had fallen, when Smeaton again landed, and\r\nthe night being perfectly still, he says, “I went on with my business till\r\nnine in the evening, having worked an hour by candlelight.” The following\r\nday he again landed, and pursued his operations until interrupted by the\r\nground-swell, which sent the surf and waves high upon the reef, and the\r\nwind rising, the sloop was forced to put for Plymouth. This is, as we\r\nshall see, but a sample of the difficulties attending the actual\r\nconstruction of the tower. Lord Ellesmere said of him that “bloody battles\r\nhad been won, and campaigns conducted to a successful issue, with less of\r\npersonal exposure to physical danger on the part of the\r\ncommander-in-chief, than was constantly encountered by Smeaton during the\r\ngreater part of those years in which the lighthouse was in course of\r\nerection. In all works of danger he himself led the way—was the first to\r\nspring upon the rock and the last to leave it; and by his own example he\r\ninspired with courage the humble workmen engaged in carrying out his\r\nplans; who, like himself, were unaccustomed to the special terrors of the\r\nscene.”(54)\r\n\r\nOn his return to town, after several other visits, when he arranged for\r\nthe formation of a better landing-place, he made his report to the\r\nproprietors, and was fully authorised to proceed with the design. He\r\naccordingly proceeded to make a careful model of the lighthouse as he\r\nintended it to be built. This having been approved by the proprietors and\r\nby the Lords of the Admiralty, the engineer set out for Plymouth,\r\narranging at Dorchester, on his way, for a supply of Portland stone, of\r\nwhich it was finally determined that the lighthouse should be mainly\r\nconstructed. Artificers and foremen were engaged; vessels provided for the\r\ntransport of men and material, and Mr. Jessop was appointed general\r\nassistant, or as it is now termed, Resident Engineer. Mr. Smeaton fixed\r\nthe centre, and laid down the lines on the afternoon of the 3rd of August,\r\n1756, and from that time the work proceeded, though with many\r\ninterruptions from bad weather and heavy seas. At best, six hours’ work\r\nwas all that could be performed at one time, and when it was possible the\r\nmen worked by torchlight. One principal object of the first season was to\r\nget the dovetail recesses cut out of the rock for the reception of the\r\nfoundation-stones. The _Neptune_ buss was employed as a store-ship, and\r\nrode at anchor a convenient distance from the rock in about twenty fathoms\r\nof water. For many days the men could not land from her, and even had they\r\nbeen able to do so, must have been washed off the rock, unless lashed to\r\nit. At such times the provisions ran short, no boat being able to come off\r\nfrom Plymouth. Towards the end of October, the yawl riding at the stern of\r\nthe buss broke loose by stress of weather and was lost. Smeaton was very\r\nanxious to finish the boring of the foundation-holes during that season,\r\nand the men still persevered when the weather gave the slightest chance,\r\nalthough sometimes only able to labour two hours out of the twenty-four.\r\n\r\nOn the completion of the work at the end of November, the party prepared\r\nto return to the yard on shore. The voyage proved most dangerous. Not\r\nbeing able, in consequence of the gale that was blowing, to make Plymouth\r\nHarbour, the _Neptune_ was steered for Fowey, on the coast of Cornwall.\r\nThe wind rose higher and higher, until it blew quite a storm; and in the\r\nnight, Mr. Smeaton, hearing a sudden alarm and clamour amongst the crew\r\noverhead, ran upon deck in his shirt to ascertain the cause. It was\r\nraining hard, and quite a hurricane was raging. “It being dark,” he says,\r\n“the first thing I saw was the horrible appearance of breakers almost\r\nsurrounding us; John Bowden, one of the seamen, crying out, ‘For God’s\r\nsake, heave hard at that rope if you mean to save your lives!’ I\r\nimmediately laid hold of the rope at which he himself was hauling as well\r\nas the other seamen, though he was also managing the helm. I not only\r\nhauled with all my strength, but called to and encouraged the workmen to\r\ndo the same thing.” Their sails were carried away or torn to ribbons,\r\nwhile the sea could be heard beating on the rocks, though nothing of the\r\ncoast could be seen. Fortunately the vessel obeyed her helm, and they put\r\nto sea again. At daybreak they found themselves out of sight of land, and\r\ndriving for the Bay of Biscay. Wearing ship, they stood once more for the\r\ncoast, and before night sighted the Land’s End. Finally, after having been\r\nblown to sea for four days, they came to anchor in Plymouth Sound, much to\r\ntheir own joy and that of their friends.\r\n\r\nWinter was very fully occupied in dressing stones at the yards ashore for\r\nnext season’s work. Mr. Smeaton himself laid all the lines on the workshop\r\nfloor in chalk, in order to insure the greatest possible accuracy in\r\nfitting. Nearly 450 tons of stone were thus dressed by the time the\r\nweather was sufficiently favourable to continue operations on the rock.\r\nDuring one of his visits to the quarries, a severe storm of thunder and\r\nlightning occurred, by which the spire of Lostwithiel Church was\r\nshattered, and this turned his attention to the necessity of protecting\r\nhis lighthouse in some way from the similar danger to which it would be\r\nexposed. Franklin had just before published his mode of protecting tall\r\nbuildings by conductors, and Smeaton decided to adopt his plan. The work\r\nof building fairly commenced in the summer of 1757, the first stone, of\r\ntwo and a quarter tons weight, being in its place on the morning of\r\nSunday, the 12th of June. By the evening of the following day the first\r\ncourse of four stones was laid, these being all required from the sloping\r\nnature of the Eddystone Rock. The actual diameter of the tower itself kept\r\nincreasing until it reached the upper level of the rock. Thus the second\r\ncourse consisted of thirteen pieces, the third of twenty-five, and so on.\r\nThe workmen were sometimes interrupted by ground-swells and heavy seas,\r\nwhich kept them off the rock for days together, but, at length, on the\r\nsixth course being laid, it was found that the building had been raised\r\nabove the average wash of the sea, and thenceforward the progress of the\r\nwork was much more rapid. The stones, when brought off from the vessels,\r\nwere all landed in their proper order, and everything was done to\r\nfacilitate the rapid progress of the work. Smeaton superintended the\r\nconstruction of nearly the whole building, and was ever foremost in the\r\npost of danger. Whilst working at the rock on one occasion, an accident\r\noccurred which might well have proved more serious in its results. “The\r\nmen were about to lay the centre stone of the seventh course, on the\r\nevening of the 11th of August, when Mr. Smeaton was enjoying the limited\r\npromenade afforded by the level platform of stone which had, with so much\r\ndifficulty, been raised; but, making a false step into one of the cavities\r\nmade for the joggles, and being unable to recover his balance, he fell\r\nfrom the brink of the work down among the rocks on the west side. The tide\r\nbeing low at the time, he speedily got upon his feet, and at first\r\nsupposed himself little hurt, but shortly after he found that one of his\r\nthumbs had been put out of joint. He reflected that he was fourteen miles\r\nfrom land, far from a surgeon, and that uncertain winds and waves lay\r\nbetween. He therefore determined to reduce the dislocation at once; and,\r\nlaying fast hold of the thumb with his other hand, and giving it a violent\r\npull, it snapped into its place again, after which he proceeded to fix the\r\ncentre stone of the building.” The work now proceeded steadily, occasional\r\ndamage being done by the heavy seas washing over the stones, tools, and\r\nmaterials.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: THE EDDYSTONE LIGHTHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nThe following winter was very tempestuous, and the floating light-ship,\r\nstationed about two miles from the rock, was driven from its moorings,\r\nthough it eventually reached harbour in safety. It was the 12th of May\r\nbefore Smeaton, anxious to see how his tower had stood the winter storms,\r\ncould land on the rock. He was delighted to find that the entire work\r\nremained intact, as he had left it. At the end of this season, the\r\ntwenty-ninth course of stones had been laid, and the apartments of the\r\nlighthouse-keepers commenced. While living at Plymouth, Smeaton used to\r\ncome out upon the Hoe(55) with his telescope and, from the spot where the\r\nSpanish Armada was first descried making for the English coast, peer out\r\ntowards the rocks on one of which his lighthouse stood. “There were still\r\nmany who persisted in asserting that no building erected of stone could\r\npossibly stand upon the Eddystone; and again and again the engineer, in\r\nthe dim grey of the morning, would come out and peer through his telescope\r\nat his deep-sea lamp-post. Sometimes he had to wait long, until he could\r\nsee a tall white pillar of spray shoot up into the air. Thank God! it was\r\nstill safe. Then, as the light grew, he could discern his building,\r\ntemporary house and all, standing firm amidst the waters; and, thus far\r\nsatisfied, he could proceed to his workshops, his mind relieved for the\r\nday.”\r\n\r\nThe winter following the third season was spent by Smeaton in London,\r\nwhere he made the designs for the cast and wrought iron and copper works\r\nof the lantern, the glass, and rails of the balcony, which were carried\r\nout under his own eye. The ensuing season proved so stormy that it was the\r\n5th of July before a landing could again be made on the rock, but from\r\nthis point the work proceeded with such rapidity that in thirteen days two\r\nentire rooms were erected, and by the 17th of August the last pieces of\r\nthe corona were set, and the forty-sixth and last course of masonry laid,\r\nbringing the tower to its specified height of seventy feet. “The last\r\nmason’s work done was the cutting out of the words ‘_Laus Deo_’ upon the\r\nlast stone set over the door of the lantern. Round the upper store-room\r\nupon the course under the ceiling, had been cut, at an earlier period,\r\n‘Except the Lord build the house, they labour in vain that build it.’ The\r\niron-work of the balcony and the lantern were next erected, and, over all,\r\nthe gilt ball, the screws of which Smeaton fixed with his own hands, ‘that\r\nin case,’ he says, ‘any of them had not held quite tight and firm, the\r\ncircumstance might not have been slipped over without my knowledge.’\r\nMoreover, this piece of work was dangerous as well as delicate, being\r\nperformed at a height of some hundred and twenty feet above the sea.\r\nSmeaton fixed the screws while standing on four boards nailed together,\r\nresting on the cupola; his assistant, Roger Cornthwaite, placing himself\r\non the opposite side, so as to balance his weight whilst he proceeded with\r\nthe operation. Smeaton worked with the men in fitting the lantern and\r\ninterior arrangements. The light was first exhibited on the night of the\r\n16th of October, 1759. About three years after its completion, one of the\r\nmost terrible storms ever known raged for days along the south-west coast;\r\nand though incalculable ruin was inflicted upon harbours and shipping by\r\nthe hurricane, all the damage done to the lighthouse was repaired by a\r\nlittle gallipot of putty.”\r\n\r\nWhatever may be the truth regarding the foundations of the Eddystone, the\r\nold lighthouse has done good work for considerably over a century.\r\nSometimes when the sea rolls in with more than usual fury the lighthouse\r\nis enveloped in spray, and when struck by a strong wave, the central\r\nportion shoots up the perpendicular shaft and leaps quite over the\r\nlantern, but soon its brilliant light shines forth again, a warning and a\r\nguide to the mariner. When a wave hurls itself upon the lighthouse, the\r\nreport of the shock is like a cannon, and a tremor passes through the\r\nbuilding. At first the lighthouse-keepers were afraid for their lives. The\r\nyear after the completion of the tower, a terrible storm raged, the sea\r\ndashing over the lighthouse so that those inside dare not open the lantern\r\ndoor, nor any other, for even an instant. A man who visited the rock after\r\nsome similar storm wrote to Mr. Jessop, “The house did shake as if a man\r\nhad been up in a great tree. The old men were almost frightened out of\r\ntheir lives, wishing they had never seen the place, and cursing those that\r\nfirst persuaded them to go there. The fear seized them in the back, but\r\nrubbing them with oil of turpentine gave them relief.” The men, however,\r\nsoon became used to the life; and Smeaton mentions the case of one of them\r\nwho was even accustomed to give up to his companions his turn for going on\r\nshore.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: PORTRAIT OF SMEATON.]\r\n\r\n“Many a heart,” says Mr. Smiles, “has leapt with gladness at the cry of\r\n‘The Eddystone in sight!’ sung out from the maintop. Homeward-bound ships,\r\nfrom far-off ports, no longer avoid the dreaded rock, but eagerly run for\r\nits light as the harbinger of safety. It might even seem as if Providence\r\nhad placed the reef so far out at sea as the foundation for a beacon such\r\nas this, leaving it to man’s skill and labour to finish His work. On\r\nentering the English Channel from the west and the south, the cautious\r\nnavigator feels his way by early soundings on the great bank which extends\r\nfrom the Channel into the Atlantic, and these are repeated at fixed\r\nintervals until land is in sight. Every fathom nearer shore increases a\r\nship’s risks, especially on dark nights. The men are on the look-out,\r\npeering anxiously into the dark, straining the eye to catch the glimmer of\r\na light, and when it is known that ‘the Eddystone is in sight!’ a thrill\r\nruns through the ship, which can only be appreciated by those who have\r\nfelt or witnessed it after long months of weary voyaging.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: INTERIOR OF THE LIGHT-CHAMBER OF THE EDDYSTONE.]\r\n\r\n“By means of similar lights, of different arrangements and of various\r\ncolours, fixed and revolving, erected upon rocks, islands, and headlands,\r\nthe British Channel is now lit up along its whole extent, and is as safe\r\nto navigate in the darkest night as in the brightest sunshine. The chief\r\ndanger is from fogs which alike hide the lights by night and the land by\r\nday. Some of the homeward-bound ships entering the Channel from North\r\nAmerican ports first make the St. Agnes Light, on the Scilly Isles,\r\nrevolving once a minute, at a height of 138 feet above high water. But\r\nmost Atlantic ships keep further south in consequence of the nature of the\r\nsoundings about the Scilly Isles; and hence they oftener make the Lizard\r\nLights first, which are visible about twenty miles off.\r\n\r\n“From this point the coast retires, and in the bend lie Falmouth (with a\r\nrevolving light on St. Anthony’s Point), Fowey, the Looes, and Plymouth\r\nSound and Harbour; the coast line again trending southward until it juts\r\nout into the sea, in the bold craggy bluffs of Bolt Head and Start Point,\r\non the last of which is another house with two lights—one, revolving, for\r\nthe Channel, and another, fixed, to direct vessels inshore clear of the\r\nSkerries Shoal. But between the Lizard and Start Point, which form the two\r\nextremities of this bend in the land of Cornwall and Devonshire, there\r\nlies the Eddystone Rock and Lighthouse, standing fourteen miles out from\r\nthe shore, almost directly in front of Plymouth Sound and in the line of\r\ncoasting vessels steaming or beating up Channel.\r\n\r\n“On the south are seen the three Croquet Lights on the Jersey side; and on\r\nthe north the two fixed lights on Portland Bill. The west is St.\r\nCatherine’s, a brilliant fixed light on the extreme south point of the\r\nIsle of Wight. Next are the lights exhibited on the Nab, and then the\r\nsingle fixed light exhibited on the Ower vessel. Beachy Head, on the same\r\nline, exhibits a powerful revolving light 285 feet above high water, its\r\ninterval of greatest brilliancy occurring every two minutes. Then comes\r\nDungeness, exhibiting a fixed red light of great power, situated at the\r\nextremity of the low point of Dungeness beach. Next are seen Folkestone,\r\nand then Dover Harbour Lights, whilst on the south are the flash light,\r\nrecently stationed on the Verne Bank; and further up Channel, on the\r\nFrench coast, is seen the brilliant revolving light on Cape Grisnez. The\r\nChannel is passed with the two South Foreland Lights, one higher than the\r\nother, on the left; and the Downs are entered with the South Sandhead\r\nfloating light on the right; and when the Gull and the North Sandhead\r\nfloating lights have been passed on the one hand, and North Foreland on\r\nthe other, then the Tongue, the Prince’s Channel, and the Girdler are\r\npassed.” The Nore Light passed, the navigation of the Thames commences.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE LIGHTHOUSE (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n          The Bell Rock—The good Abbot of Arberbrothok—Ralph the\r\n    Rover—Rennie’s grand Lighthouse—Perils of the Work—Thirty-two Men\r\n          apparently doomed to Destruction—A New Form of Outward\r\n     Construction—Its successful Completion—The Skerryvore Lighthouse\r\n      and Alan Stevenson—Novel Barracks on the Rock—Swept Away in a\r\n        Storm—The Unshapely Seal and Unfortunate Cod—Half-starved\r\n    Workmen—Out of Tobacco—Difficulties of Landing the Stones—Visit of\r\n        M. de Quatrefages to Héhaux—Description of the Lighthouse\r\n      Exterior—How it Rocks—Practice _versus_ Theory—The Interior—A\r\n                        Parisian Apartment at Sea.\r\n\r\n\r\nSome eleven miles eastward from the mainland of Scotland, near the\r\nentrances to the Firths of Forth and Tay, lies an extensive ledge of very\r\ndangerous rocks, nearly two miles in length. This sunken reef was a source\r\nof much peril to the unfortunate sailors driven too near its nearly hidden\r\ndangers, and early in the fourteenth century the Abbot of Arbroath, or\r\nArberbrothok, caused a bell to be placed upon the principal rock, so that—\r\n\r\n  “When the Rock was hid by the surge’s swell,\r\n  The mariners heard the warning bell;\r\n  And then they knew the perilous Rock,\r\n  And blessed the Abbot of Arberbrothok.”\r\n\r\nSouthey has, in his ballad of “The Inchcape Rock,” immortalised the\r\ntradition(56) that a notorious pirate cut the bell from the rock—\r\n\r\n  “Down sank the bell with a gurgling sound,\r\n  The bubbles arose and burst around;\r\n  Quoth Sir Ralph, ‘The next who comes to the Rock,\r\n  Won’t bless the Abbot of Arberbrothok.’”\r\n\r\nAnd so the rover sailed away, and grew rich with plundered store, till at\r\nlength he thought of Scotland once again, and turned his vessel’s head for\r\nhome. He approached her coasts in haze and fog, and knew he could not be\r\nfar from the rocky shore.\r\n\r\n  “They hear no sound, the swell is strong;\r\n  Though the wind hath fallen they drift along,\r\n  Till the vessel strikes with a shivering shock,—\r\n  ‘Oh, Christ! it is the Inchcape Rock!’\r\n\r\n  “Sir Ralph the Rover tore his hair;\r\n  He curst himself in his despair;\r\n  The waves rush in on every side,\r\n  The ship is sinking beneath the tide.”\r\n\r\nNothing was done to replace the bell or set a beacon on the reef until the\r\nbeginning of the present century, when, after many plans had been\r\ndiscussed, John Rennie was ordered by the Board of Commissioners to\r\nexamine the site and report on the subject generally. He recommended a\r\nsubstantial stone lighthouse, similar to that on the Eddystone. Although\r\nthe Inchcape Rock was not so long uncovered by the tide as the former,\r\nafter a few courses had been laid, there would be no greater delay in\r\ncompleting the building. The Commissioners obtained from Parliament the\r\nrequisite powers in 1806; Rennie was appointed engineer, with Robert\r\nStevenson as assistant engineer.\r\n\r\nThe whole of the year 1807 was occupied in constructing the necessary\r\nvessels for conveying the stones, and in erecting suitable machinery and\r\nbuilding shops at Arbroath, which was fixed upon as the most convenient\r\npoint on the coast for carrying on the land operations. Some progress was\r\nmade on the rock itself, where a smith’s forge was erected and a temporary\r\nbeacon raised, while a floating light, fitted up on an old fishing-boat,\r\nwas anchored near the reef until the lighthouse could be completed. During\r\nthe short period in which the rocks were uncovered or unexposed to the\r\nfury of the waves, some progress was made with the excavations for the\r\nfoundations. The dangerous nature of the employment may be illustrated by\r\nthe following brief account of an accident which happened to the workmen\r\non the 2nd of September, before the excavation for the first course of\r\nstones had been completed. An additional number of masons had that morning\r\ncome off from Arbroath in the tender named the _Smeaton_, in honour of the\r\nengineer of the Eddystone, and had landed them safely on the rock. The\r\nvessel rode off at some distance. The wind rising, the men began to be\r\nuneasy as to the security of the _Smeaton’s_ cables, and a party went off\r\nin a boat to examine whether she was secure, but before they could reach\r\nthe vessel’s side they found she had already gone adrift, leaving the\r\ngreater part of the men upon the reef in the face of a rising tide.\r\n\r\nBy the time the _Smeaton’s_ crew had got her mainsail set, and made a tack\r\ntowards their companions, she had drifted about three miles to leeward,\r\nwith both wind and tide against her, and it was clear that she could not\r\npossibly make the rock until long after it had been completely covered.\r\nThere were thirty-two men in all on the rock, provided with but two boats,\r\ncapable of carrying only twenty-four persons in fine weather. Mr.\r\nStevenson seems to have behaved with great coolness and presence of mind;\r\nthough he afterwards confessed that of the two feelings of hope and\r\ndespair the latter largely predominated. Fully persuaded of the perils of\r\nthe situation, he kept his fears to himself, and allowed the men to\r\ncontinue their occupations of boring and excavating.\r\n\r\n“After working for about three hours, the water began to rise along the\r\nlower parts of the foundations, and the men were compelled to desist. The\r\nforge-fire became extinguished; the smith ceased from hammering at the\r\nanvil, and the masons from hewing and boring; and when they took up their\r\ntools to depart, and looked around, their vessel was not to be seen, and\r\nthe third of their boats had gone after the _Smeaton_, which was drifting\r\naway in the distance! Not a word was uttered, but the danger of their\r\nposition was comprehended by all. They looked towards their master in\r\nsilence; but the anxiety which had been growing in his mind for some time\r\nhad now become so intense that he was speechless. When he attempted to\r\nspeak, he was so parched that his tongue refused utterance. Turning to one\r\nof the pools on the rock, he lapped a little water, which gave him relief,\r\nthough it was salt; but what was his happiness when, on raising his head,\r\nsome one called out, ‘A boat! a boat!’ and sure enough a large boat was\r\nseen through the surge making for them. She proved to be the Bell Rock\r\npilot-boat, which had come off from Arbroath with letters, and her timely\r\narrival doubtless saved the lives of the greater part of the workmen. They\r\nwere all taken off and landed in safety, though completely drenched and\r\nexhausted.”\r\n\r\nRennie, accompanied by one of his sons, visited the rock on the 5th of\r\nOctober, 1807, the day before the works were suspended for the winter.\r\nThey came off from Arbroath, and stayed on board the lighthouse-yacht all\r\nnight, where Stevenson met him, and has recorded the delightful\r\nconversations held on general and professional matters. On the following\r\nmorning Rennie landed, amidst great _éclat_ and a display of all the\r\navailable colours, to inspect the progress made. The whole party, workmen\r\nand all, returned to shore for the season that day.\r\n\r\nThe preparation of the stone blocks occupied next winter, and by the\r\nspring large numbers were ready and were floated off. In May, 1808, the\r\nexcavations on the rock were continued, and on the 10th of July the first\r\nstone was laid with considerable ceremony. By the last week of November\r\nthree courses of masonry had been laid. By the end of 1809 the tower had\r\nbeen built to a height of thirty feet, and was almost secure from the fury\r\nof the waves. “In his report to the commissioners he stated that he found\r\nthat the form of slope which he had adopted for the base of the tower, as\r\nwell as the curve of the building, fully answered his expectations—that\r\nthey presented comparatively small obstructions to the roll of the waves,\r\nwhich played round the column with ease.” The curve of this tower at the\r\nbase is much greater than that of the Eddystone. The Bell Rock Lighthouse\r\nwas completed by the end of 1810, and the light was regularly exhibited\r\nafter the 1st of February, 1811. Counting to the top of the lantern, it is\r\n127 feet high. It may here be remarked that in many works the credit of\r\ndesigning and building this lighthouse has been given to Robert Stevenson,\r\nthe resident engineer. Rennie, however, has the only rightful claim to be\r\nso considered; he acted throughout as chief engineer, furnished the design\r\ndown to the pettiest details, settled the kind of stone and other\r\nmaterials to be used, down even to the mortar and mode of mixing it.\r\n\r\nAnother work of great labour and difficulty was the erection of a\r\nlighthouse on the Skerryvore Rocks, which lie twelve miles W.S.W. of the\r\nIsle of Tyree in Argyllshire, and were formerly the scene of numerous\r\nwrecks. The operations were commenced in 1838, the architect being Alan\r\nStevenson, son of the Robert Stevenson who was employed on the Bell Rock\r\nLighthouse. The engineer gave the world a succinct account(57) of the\r\ndifficulties, dangers, and successful issue of the undertaking.\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: LIGHTHOUSE ON THE INCHCAPE ROCK.]\r\n\r\nThe actual construction of the lighthouse had no very remarkable points of\r\ndifference with the works of Smeaton or Rennie. Stevenson built a rather\r\nnovel structure on the rock as a temporary barrack for the workmen. It\r\nconsisted of a wooden tower perched upon a triangular framework, under\r\nwhich was an open gallery, the floor of which was removed at the end of\r\neach season, so as to allow free space for the passage of the sea during\r\nthe storms of winter, but on which, during summer, they kept the stock of\r\ncoals, the tool-chest, the beef and beer casks, and other smaller\r\nmaterial, which they could not, even at that season of the year, leave on\r\nthe rock itself. Next came the kitchen and provision-store, a six-sided\r\napartment about twelve feet in diameter, and somewhat more than seven feet\r\nhigh, in which small space—curtailed as it was by the seven beams which\r\npassed through it—stood a caboose, capable of cooking for forty men, and\r\nvarious cupboards and lockers lined with tin, for holding biscuits, meal\r\nand flour, &c. The next storey held two apartments: one for Mr. Stevenson,\r\nin which he had his hammock, desk, chair and table, books and instruments.\r\nThe top storey was surmounted by a pyramidal roof, and was lined with four\r\ntiers of berths, capable of accommodating thirty people. The framework was\r\nerected on a part of the rock as far removed as possible from the proposed\r\nfoundation of the lighthouse tower; but in a great gale which occurred on\r\nthe 3rd of November it was entirely destroyed and swept from the rock,\r\nnothing remaining to point out its site but a few broken and twisted iron\r\nstanchions, and attached to one of them a piece of a beam, so shaken and\r\nrent by dashing against the rock as literally to resemble a bunch of\r\nlaths. Thus did one night obliterate the traces of a season’s toil, and\r\nblast the hopes which the workmen fondly cherished of a stable dwelling on\r\nthe rock, and of refuge from the miseries of sea-sickness, which the\r\nexperience of the season had taught many of them to dread more than death\r\nitself. A more successful attempt was subsequently made, and the second\r\nerection braved the storm for several years after the works were finished.\r\n“Perched forty feet above the wave-beaten rock,” says Stevenson, “in this\r\nsingular abode, the writer of this little volume(58) has spent many a\r\nweary day and night at those times when the sea prevented any one going\r\ndown to the rock, anxiously looking for supplies from the shore, and\r\nearnestly longing for a change of weather favourable to the\r\nre-commencement of the works. For miles around nothing could be seen but\r\nwhite foaming breakers, and nothing heard but howling winds and lashing\r\nseas. At such seasons most of our time was spent in bed; for there alone\r\nwe had effectual shelter from the winds and the spray, which searched\r\nevery cranny in the walls of the barrack. Our slumbers, too, were at times\r\nfearfully interrupted by the sudden pouring of the sea over the roof, the\r\nrocking of the house on its pillars, and the spirting of water through the\r\nseams of the doors and windows: symptoms which, to one suddenly aroused\r\nfrom sound sleep, recalled the appalling fate of the former barrack, which\r\nhad been engulfed in the foam not twenty yards from our dwelling, and for\r\na moment seemed to summon us to a similar fate. On two occasions, in\r\nparticular, those sensations were so vivid as to cause almost every one to\r\nspring out of bed; and some of the men flew from the barrack by a\r\ntemporary gangway to the more stable but less comfortable shelter afforded\r\nby the bare wall of the lighthouse tower, then unfinished, where they\r\nspent the remainder of the night in the darkness and the cold.”\r\n\r\nYet life on the Skerryvore was by no means destitute of its peculiar\r\npleasures. The grandeur of the ocean’s rage, the deep murmur of the waves,\r\nthe hoarse cry of the sea-birds, were varied by peaceful hours, when the\r\nsea was glassy and the deep blue vault of heaven was studded with a\r\nthousand stars. “Among the many wonders of the ‘great deep,’” says\r\nStevenson, “which we witnessed at the Skerryvore, not the least is the\r\nagility and power displayed by the unshapely seal. I have often seen half\r\na dozen of these animals round the rock, playing on the surface or riding\r\non the crests of curling waves, come so close as to permit us to see their\r\neyes and head, and lead us to expect that they would be thrown _high and\r\ndry_ at the foot of the tower; when suddenly they performed a somersault\r\nwithin a few feet of the rock, and diving into the flaky and wreathing\r\nfoam, disappeared, and as suddenly re-appeared a hundred yards off,\r\nuttering a strange low cry.”\r\n\r\nOn one occasion the tender could not come off to the poor people on the\r\nrock for seven weeks. The seamen passed a most dreary time. Their\r\nprovisions and fuel were short; their clothes were worn to rags; and, what\r\nwas to them of more importance still, they _were out of tobacco_!\r\n\r\nOne of the great difficulties experienced was landing the stones on the\r\nrock from the lighters, which, towed out by a steamer, were cast off as\r\nnear the landing-place as possible and then towed in by boats. The landing\r\nservice throughout the whole progress of the works was one of danger and\r\nanxiety, and many narrow escapes were made. On many occasions the men who\r\nsteered the lighters ran great risks, and it was often found necessary to\r\nlash them to the rails, to prevent them being thrown overboard by the\r\nsudden bounds of the vessels, or being carried away by the weight of water\r\nwhich swept their decks as they were towed through a heavy sea. Sometimes\r\nthey were forced, owing to the heavy seas which threatened to throw the\r\nvessels on the top of the rock, to draw out the lighters from the wharf\r\nwithout landing a single stone, after they had been towed through a stormy\r\npassage of thirteen miles. One day, during the very best part of the\r\nseason, so sudden were the jerks of the vessel before the sea, that eight\r\nlarge warps, or cables, were snapped like threads, and the lighter was\r\ncarried violently before a crested wave which rolled unexpectedly upon\r\nher. Those who stood on deck were thrown flat on their faces, and imagined\r\nthat the vessel had been laid high and dry on the top of the rock. Yet, in\r\nspite of the short season and great difficulties of the work, no less than\r\n120 lighters were towed out and discharged in the summer and autumn of\r\n1841. During the progress of building the lighthouse, cranes and other\r\nmaterials were swept away by the waves, and daily risks were run in\r\nblasting the splintery gneiss, or by the falling of heavy bodies from the\r\ntower on the narrow space below, to which so many persons were necessarily\r\nconfined. Yet no loss of life or limb occurred; and “our remarkable\r\npreservation was viewed,” says Stevenson, “as in a peculiar manner the\r\ngracious work of Him by whom ‘the very hairs of our head are all\r\nnumbered.’”\r\n\r\nThe light was first exhibited on the 1st of February, 1844. It is a\r\nrevolving apparatus, and the light appears at its brightest state once in\r\nevery minute. The lantern is no less than 150 feet above the sea, and its\r\nflashes may be seen from the deck of a vessel eighteen miles off. It is\r\nfrequently seen from the high land of Barra, distant thirty-eight miles.\r\nThe mass of stonework is double that of the Bell Rock Lighthouse, and five\r\ntimes that of the Eddystone; it measures 58,580 cubic feet. The Skerryvore\r\nLight-tower was erected at a cost of £86,977 17s. 7d.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: THE SKERRYVORE LIGHTHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nThe eminent French naturalist, M. de Quatrefages, has given us an\r\nadmirable description(59) of a visit paid by him to the lighthouse of\r\nHéhaux, on a rock near the Isles of Bréhat, off the coast of Brittany. He\r\nsays, after some very beautiful remarks on the contemplation of nature,\r\nand its alleviation of the worst heart-sorrows: “Twilight often surprised\r\nme in the midst of my reveries, and often, too, the shades of night fell\r\naround me while I lay stretched beneath the star-bespangled deep azure\r\ncanopy of heaven. I could then see another star shining in the far\r\ndistance, which had been lighted by the hand of man. From the position I\r\nhad chosen I could recognise the beacon-towers of Héhaux, of which the\r\nseamen of the islands had spoken to me with the liveliest expressions of\r\nenthusiasm, and which I had frequently watched by day as it stood out like\r\na black line drawn along the whitish background of the sky. I would not\r\nleave Bréhat without visiting it. A few slight services had secured me the\r\ngood-will of the officers of customs, who willingly consented to take me\r\nto Héhaux. Accordingly, one splendid day in October we left the harbour of\r\nLa Corderie in a pinnace, manned by six sturdy seamen. The weather was\r\nsplendid; not a cloud obscured the sky, which was reflected on the\r\nmirror-like surface of the ocean, whose depths it seemed to double.\r\nImpelled by the combined action of a light wind, which swelled out two\r\nsmall square sails, and of the rapid current imparted to the waters of\r\nKerpont by the force of the tide, our pinnace shot across the waves as a\r\nsledge glides over the snow. Sometimes, indeed, we passed through a\r\nwhirling eddy, which shook every part of our frail craft, and betrayed the\r\nvicinity of some submarine rock; but we soon regained the unruffled sea,\r\nand without having taken cognisance of the rapid rate at which we were\r\nmoving, we saw Bréhat sink below the distant horizon behind us, whilst\r\nrock after rock and islet after islet seemed at every moment to emerge\r\nfrom the waves towards which we were advancing.... The nearer we drew to\r\nHéhaux the taller seemed the beacon-tower, which stood forth from the\r\ntower, with its lofty granite column and glass lantern, protected by that\r\nmagical rod which is able to attract and safely conduct to earth the\r\ndestructive force of the thunderbolt. We landed, and at once began our\r\ninspection of this colossal block, which has been upreared by the hand of\r\nman on the Epées de Tréguier, which, once the dread of the seaman, have\r\nbecome his protecting guides through the storms and darkness of night.\r\n\r\n“The Héhaux Lighthouse would be regarded as a most remarkable monument\r\neven in our principal towns, but standing, as it does, alone in the midst\r\nof the ocean, it acquires by its very isolation a character of severe\r\ngrandeur, which impresses the mind most powerfully. Figure to yourself a\r\nwall of granite, where the current and the storm do not even permit the\r\nhardiest ferns to take root, with here and there a twisted and deeply\r\nwave-worn mass projecting beyond the rest of the rocky ledge. It is here\r\nthat the architect has laid the foundation of the tower. The base, which\r\nis of a conical form, is surmounted by a circular gallery. The lower\r\nportion curves gracefully outwards, spreading over the ground like the\r\nroot of some colossal marine plant springing up from the foundation\r\nstones, which have been inserted far within the rock. On this base, which\r\nmeasures about twenty yards across, rises a column twenty-six feet in\r\ndiameter, surmounted by a second gallery, whose supports and stone\r\nbalustrades call to mind the portcullis and battlements of some feudal\r\ndonjon. From the summit to the base this part of the edifice is composed\r\nof large blocks of whitish granite, arranged in regular strata, and\r\ncarefully dove-tailed into one another. As far as a third of the height of\r\nthe building the rows of stones are bound together by granite joggles,\r\nwhich at the same time penetrate into the two superposed stones. The\r\nstones have been cut and arranged with such precision that there has been\r\nhardly any reason for using cement, which has only been employed in\r\nfilling up a few imperceptible voids: and hence the lighthouse, from the\r\nbase to the summit, seems to form one solid block, which is more\r\nhomogeneous and probably more compact than the rocks which support it. The\r\nplatform which crowns this magnificent column, at an elevation of more\r\nthan 140 feet above high tide watermark, is surmounted by a stone cupola,\r\nat once solid and graceful, supported by pillars which are separated by\r\nlarge panes of glass. It is within this frame of glass that the beacon is\r\nlighted, which may be distinctly seen from every direction at a distance\r\nof twenty-seven miles.\r\n\r\n“At low tide the sea leaves a space of several hundred square yards\r\nuncovered round the base of the edifice; at high tide it entirely\r\nsurrounds it. It is then that the tower of Héhaux rises in its solemn\r\nisolation from the midst of the waves, as if it were a standard of\r\ndefiance upraised by the genius of man against the demon of the tempest.\r\nAt times one might almost fancy that the heavens and the sea, conscious of\r\nthe outrage offered to them, were leagued together against the enemy,\r\nwhich seems to brave them by its imperturbability. The north-west wind\r\nroars round the tower, darkening its thick glass windows with torrents of\r\nrain and drifts of snow and hail. These impetuous blasts bear along with\r\nthem from the far-spread ocean colossal waves, whose crests not\r\nunfrequently reach the first gallery, but these fluid masses slide away\r\nfrom the round and polished surfaces of the granite, which leave them no\r\npoints of adhesion, and darting their long lines of foam above the cupola,\r\nthey break with thundering roar against the rocks of Stallio-Bras or the\r\nboulders of Sillon. The tower supports these terrific assaults without\r\ninjury, although it bends, as if in homage, before the might of its foes.\r\nI was assured by the keepers that during a violent storm the oil in the\r\nlamps of the highest rooms presents a variation of level exceeding an\r\ninch, which would lead us to assume that the summit of the tower describes\r\nan arc of about a yard in extent. This very flexibility seems, however, in\r\nitself a proof of durability. At all events, we meet with similar\r\nconditions in several monuments, which for ages have braved the inclemency\r\nof recurring seasons. The spire of Strasburg Cathedral, in particular,\r\nbends its long ogives and slender pinnacles beneath the force of the\r\nwinds, while the cross on its summit oscillates at an elevation of more\r\nthan 450 feet above the ground.\r\n\r\n“To construct a monument on these rocks, which seemed the very focus of\r\nall the storms which raged on that part of our coasts, was like building\r\nan edifice in the open sea. Such a project must, indeed, have appeared at\r\nfirst sight almost impracticable. After their third season of labour, the\r\nworkmen completed the foundations of the tower and fixed the key-stone of\r\nthe cupola. In vain did difficulties of every kind combine with the winds\r\nand waves to oppose the work; human industry has come forth victorious\r\nfrom the struggle, and although a thousand difficulties and dangers beset\r\nthe labourers, no serious accident to them or their work troubled the joy\r\nof their triumph. Only on one occasion was science at fault. In order to\r\nfacilitate the arrival of the stones, which had to be brought from a\r\ndistance of several leagues, and cut at Bréhat, the skilful engineer who\r\nhad furnished all the plans and superintended their execution wished to\r\nconstruct a wooden pier for the disembarkation of the stones at the spot\r\nwhere they were required. Several of the older seamen objected to the plan\r\nas impracticable, but M. Reynaud, who was not familiar with the sea, and\r\nwho, moreover, was proud of having stemmed the current of rapid rivers,\r\ntrusted to the stability of his massive piles, clamped together with iron\r\nand bronze. But he was soon compelled to admit his mistake. The first\r\nstorm sufficed to scatter over the waters the whole of these ponderous and\r\nsolid materials like so many pieces of straw. So a crane was attached to\r\nthe summit of a rock, to which boats could be moored, and the materials\r\nfor building were then drawn up to a railway which had been thrown over\r\nthe precipice that separated this natural landing-place from the site of\r\nthe tower.\r\n\r\n“Now that we have admired the exterior of the lighthouse, follow me into\r\nthe interior by the help of these steps, which have been formed by the\r\ninsertion of bars of copper into the stone. Let us pause for a moment to\r\nadmire the ponderous bronze doors which hermetically seal the entrance,\r\nbefore we plunge into those vaults which look as if they had been cut out\r\nof the solid rock. We are in the first storey, surrounded by stores of\r\nwood and ropes and workmen’s tools. Above, we perceive cases of zinc,\r\nwhich, we are told, contain oil to feed the lamps and water for the use of\r\nthe men employed in the building. In the third storey is the kitchen, with\r\nits pantry and larder, on a level with the first gallery. We need not\r\nenter the three apartments appropriated to the use of the men, for, beyond\r\nbeing very simple and clean, there is nothing to record concerning them.\r\nBut we have now reached the seventh storey, and we must rest for a few\r\nmoments in the little octagonal saloon, set apart for the engineers, when\r\nthey come to inspect the condition of the lighthouse. Here, in the midst\r\nof the ocean, more than a hundred feet above the level of the sea, you\r\nwill find the comfort and almost the elegance of a Parisian apartment.\r\n\r\n“Let us now return to the spiral staircase which has brought us thus far,\r\nand which will carry us at once to the portion of the edifice which is\r\nmore particularly destined to fulfil the special purpose for which the\r\ntower is designed. The eighth storey contains vessels of oil, glasses,\r\nrevolving lamps, some admirable instruments intended for meteorological\r\nobservations, a thermometer, barometer, and chronometer. Here the spiral\r\nstaircase terminates in a flattened arch, which supports a slender pillar,\r\ncut into steps, which are the only means of communication with the\r\nwatch-tower above, in which the men take it by turns to keep guard every\r\nnight. You will be surprised on looking round to perceive that this\r\napartment is coated with different coloured marbles, which line the walls\r\nand vaulted roof, and even cover the floor. But this luxury, which may\r\nappear to you so much out of place, has been introduced from necessity.\r\nThe apparatus for lighting the building enters the room through a circular\r\naperture in the ceiling, and hence the most extreme cleanliness becomes\r\nnecessary, which could alone be obtained by the aid of perfectly polished\r\nsurfaces.”\r\n\r\nThe tenth and last flight of steps brings one beneath the cupola, and to\r\nthe machinery by which a light of the first order is maintained.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                      THE LIGHTHOUSE (_concluded_).\r\n\r\n\r\n      Lighthouses on Sand—Literally screwed down—The Light on Maplin\r\n        Sands—That of Port Fleetwood—Iron Lighthouses—The Lanterns\r\n      themselves—Eddystone long Illuminated with Tallow Candles—Coal\r\n          Fires—Revolution caused by the invention of the Argand\r\n         Burner—Improvements in Reflectors—The Electric Light at\r\n    Sea—Flashing and Revolving Lights—Coloured Lights—Their Advantages\r\n      and Disadvantages—Lanterns obscured by Moths, Bees, and Birds.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe difficulties involved in constructing a lighthouse on solid rock have\r\nbeen shown, and it was at one time thought absolutely impossible to\r\nerect—with any prospect of permanent duration—one upon storm-exposed\r\nsands. _Nous avons changé tout cela._ It is no longer necessary to place\r\nfloating lights in places of great danger, although for other reasons they\r\nare constantly used. One of the greatest modern triumphs of engineering is\r\nMitchell’s screw-mooring apparatus. To describe it fully would necessitate\r\nseveral pages of technical matter. Suffice it to say that enormous\r\ncast-iron screws, having hollow cylindrical centres, through which\r\nwrought-iron spindles pass, are literally screwed down into the sand, or\r\nits substratum of other soil. One of the earliest experiments was made on\r\nthe verge of the Maplin Sand, at the mouth of the Thames. Nine of the\r\nmooring-screws were inserted into the sand 21½ feet, one in the centre,\r\nthe rest forming an octagon 42 feet in circumference, having standards or\r\nposts which stood 5 feet above the surface of the sand. A raft of timber\r\nwas floated over the spot, and a capstan in its centre drove the screws to\r\nthe required depth. This raft was afterwards sunk, by covering it with 200\r\ntons of rough stone. Two years were allowed to elapse, at the termination\r\nof which time the whole mass was found firmly embedded, and then a\r\nlighthouse, raised on a strong open framework, was erected over this\r\nsub-structure. During these long preparations a very similar structure was\r\ncommenced and finished at Port Fleetwood, on the River Wyre, near\r\nLancaster.\r\n\r\nThe preparatory steps were similar to those already described. The\r\nfoundation of the lighthouse was formed of seven screw-piles, six of them\r\noccupying the angles of a hexagon 46 feet in diameter, the seventh being\r\nin the centre. From each screw proceeds a pile 15 feet in length, having\r\nat the upper end another screw for securing a wooden column. These columns\r\nare of Baltic timber, the one in the centre being 56 feet, the others 46\r\nfeet in length, firmly secured with iron hoops and coated with pitch. The\r\nplatform, upon which the house stands, is 27 feet in diameter, the house\r\nitself being 20 feet in diameter and 9 feet high. From the summit of the\r\nhouse rises a twelve-sided lantern, 10 feet in diameter and 8 feet high.\r\nAltogether the light is elevated about 46 feet above low-water level, and\r\nranges over an horizon of eight miles. The light is of the dioptric\r\nkind—bright, steady, and uniform, and when the weather is too foggy to\r\nallow it to be seen, a bell is tolled by machinery, to give the needful\r\nwarning.\r\n\r\nAt the period when screw-pile lighthouses were being thus successfully\r\nerected, other and most valuable suggestions were being made for the\r\nbuilding of bronze and cast-iron lighthouses. The great advantage of iron\r\nover stone and other materials in those portions of the building not\r\nactually in contact with sea-water soon became apparent. Upon a given base\r\na much larger internal capacity could be obtained; plates could be cast in\r\nlarge surfaces and with few joints, and a system of binding adopted which\r\nshould ensure the perfect combination of every part. The comparatively\r\nsmall bulk and weight also of the component parts gave great facilities\r\nfor the transport and rapid construction of such structures. The initial\r\ncast-iron lighthouse was designed by Mr. Gordon in 1840, and was cast and\r\nput together within three months from the date of the contract. It was\r\nthen taken to pieces and shipped for Jamaica, on which island it now\r\nlights up Morant Point, a point of great danger. The Commissioners of the\r\nHouse of Assembly had applied to Mr. Gordon to supply a suitable\r\nlighthouse at the smallest possible cost, and in furnishing them with the\r\nstructure of cast-iron he fulfilled their wishes admirably, the expense\r\nnot exceeding one-third of the cost of a similar building in stone. This\r\nelegant lighthouse, the outline of which resembles that of the Celtic\r\ntowers of Ireland, was exhibited to visitors while it stood complete in\r\nthe contractor’s premises. The diameter of the tower is 18 feet 6 inches\r\nat the base, diminishing to 11 feet under the cap. The tower is formed of\r\nnine tiers of iron plates, each tier being 10 feet high and about\r\nthree-quarters of an inch thick. At the base of the structure eleven\r\nplates are required to form the circumference, at the top nine plates;\r\nthey are cast with a flange around their inner edges, and when put\r\ntogether these flanges form the joints, which are fastened together with\r\nnut-and-screw bolts and caulked with iron cement. The interior of the\r\ntower, to the height of 27 feet, was to be filled up with masonry and\r\nconcrete of the weight of 300 tons; the remainder is divided into\r\nstore-rooms and berths for the attendants. The tower is finished by an\r\niron railing, within which rises the light-room, also of cast-iron, with\r\nwindows of plate-glass. A copper roof and a short lightning-rod complete\r\nthe whole. The Admiralty notice announced the exhibition of this light on\r\nMorant Point November 1st, 1842, and stated that the elevation of the\r\nlight is 97 feet above the level of the sea, and that in clear weather it\r\nis visible at a distance of twenty-one miles. The light is of the\r\nrevolving kind, consisting of fifteen Argand lamps and reflectors, five in\r\neach side of an equilateral triangle, and so placed as to produce a\r\ncontinuous light, but with periodical flashes. The tower is painted white,\r\nand the lower portion is coated with coal-tar to preserve it from rust. It\r\nrests on a granite base, and is also cased with granite near the\r\nfoundation, the more certainly to prevent the action of the sea-water on\r\nthe metal.\r\n\r\nWhile the engineer had attained some of his greatest triumphs in the\r\nconstruction of lighthouses, the optician had not once directed his\r\nattention to the invention of a brilliant light, worthy to be placed upon\r\nthe structure which proudly rose high above the fierce waves with the\r\nstrength and solidity of a rock. During a period of forty years after the\r\ncompletion of the Eddystone tower by Smeaton, the lantern was illuminated\r\nby tallow candles stuck in hoops, just as a stand or booth is lighted at a\r\ncountry fair, and so lately as the year 1811 it was lighted with\r\ntwenty-four wax candles. In 1812 the Lizard Light was maintained with coal\r\nfires; and in 1816, when the Isle of May Light, in the Firth of Forth, was\r\ntaken possession of by the Commissioners of the Northern Lighthouses, a\r\ncoal fire was exhibited in a _chauffer_—a description of light which had\r\nbeen exhibited for 181 years. In 1801 the light at Harwich, in addition to\r\nthe coal fire, had a _flat_ plate of rough brass on the landward side, to\r\nserve as a reflector. Such methods of lighting were of course very\r\ndeficient in power, and did not enable the mariner to distinguish one\r\nlight from another—a point which is often of as much importance as the\r\nbrilliancy of the light itself. Prior to the invention of the Argand lamp\r\n(about 1784) the production of a strong and brilliant light from a single\r\nsource was scarcely possible, and even such a lamp, by its unassisted\r\npowers, would not be of very great value in giving early notice to the\r\nmariner of his approach to the coast, which ought to be the primary object\r\nof a lighthouse. As the rays of a luminous body proceed in all directions\r\nin straight lines, it is obvious that in the case of a single lamp the\r\nmariner would derive benefit only from that small portion of light which\r\nproceeded from the centre of the flame to his eye. The other rays would\r\nproceed to other parts of the horizon, or escape upwards to the sky, or\r\ndownwards to the earth, and thus be of no value to him. By increasing the\r\nnumber of burners a small portion of light from each burner would slightly\r\nincrease the effective action, but by far the greater portion of the light\r\nproduced would escape uselessly above and below the horizon and also at\r\nthe back of each flame. Next, these defects were remedied, and the\r\nefficiency of the light greatly increased, by placing behind each lamp a\r\nreflector of such a form as to collect the rays that would otherwise be\r\nlost, and throw them forward to the horizon. The adoption of such a method\r\nhas led to what is called the catoptric system of lights.\r\n\r\n [Illustration: HOLOPHOTAL REVOLVING LIGHT. (FIRST ORDER) FLOATING LIGHT\r\n          LANTERN. HOLOPHOTAL REVOLVING LIGHT. (FOURTH ORDER.)\r\n                       REVOLVING LIGHT APPARATUS.\r\n         (_From Drawings supplied by Messrs. W. Wilkins & Co._)]\r\n\r\nAlan Stevenson states that the earliest notice he has been able to find of\r\nthe application of paraboloidal mirrors to lighthouses is in a work on\r\n“Practical Seamanship” (Liverpool, 1791), by Mr. William Hutchinson, who\r\nnotices the erection of the four lights at Bidstone and Hoylake for the\r\nentrance of the Mersey, in 1763, and describes large paraboloidal moulds\r\nof wood lined with mirror glass and smaller ones of polished tin-plate, as\r\nin use in those lighthouses. In France M. Téulère, a Member of the Royal\r\nCorps of Engineers of Bridges and Roads, is regarded as the inventor of\r\nthe catoptric system of lights. In a memoir dated 26th June, 1783, he is\r\nsaid to have proposed for the Cordouan Lighthouse a combination of\r\nparaboloidal reflectors with Argand lamps, arranged on a revolving frame,\r\na plan which was actually carried into execution, under the direction of\r\nthe Chevalier Borda.(60) The plan was so successful that it was soon\r\nadopted in England by the Trinity House of London; and in Scotland the\r\nfirst work of the Northern Lights Board, in 1787, was to light a lantern\r\non the Old Castle of Kinnaird Head, in Aberdeenshire, by means of\r\nparabolic reflectors and lamps. These reflectors were formed of facets of\r\nmirror-glass placed in hollow paraboloidal moulds of plaster. The more\r\ncomplicated arrangement of lenses placed round a centre in concentric\r\ncircles is due to the great Fresnel, a practical man of science, whose\r\nabilities are acknowledged as fully in England as in France.\r\n\r\nThe oil used in the lighthouses of the United Kingdom has generally been\r\nsperm. Colza, the expressed oil of the wild cabbage (_Brassica oleracea_),\r\nwas very generally used in France, and occasionally in Great Britain. Gas\r\nis used in a few places, where its application is easy. There can hardly\r\nbe any doubt now, however, that the coming light will be the electric,\r\nsince its steady production is becoming a matter of scientific certainty.\r\nAs early as 1857 Professor Holmes submitted to the Trinity House a method\r\nof employing this light, which was submitted to Faraday, and approved. The\r\nBoard then allowed a trial at the South Foreland Lighthouse. The light was\r\nfirst displayed on the 8th of December, 1858. In June, 1862, it was\r\npermanently fixed at Dungeness. In Faraday’s Report to the Trinity House,\r\npublished in 1862, he says: “Arrangements were made on shore by which\r\nobservations could be made at sea, about five miles off, on the relative\r\nlight of the electric lamp and the metallic reflectors with their Argand\r\noil-lamps, for either could be shown alone, or both together. At the given\r\ndistance the eye could not separate the two lights, but by the telescope\r\nthey were distinguishable. The combined effect was a glorious light up to\r\nfive miles; then, if the electric light was extinguished, there was a\r\ngreat falling off in the effect, though, after a few moments’ rest to the\r\neye, it was seen that the oil-lamps and reflectors were in their good and\r\nproper state. On the other hand, when the electric light was restored, the\r\nglory rose to its first high condition.... During the day-time I compared\r\nthe intensity of the light with that of the sun, and both looked at\r\nthrough dark glasses. Its light was as bright as that of the sun, but the\r\nsun was not at its brightest.”\r\n\r\nThe number of lights on a well-frequented coast being considerable, it is\r\nof the utmost importance to arrange them so as to enable the mariner\r\neasily to distinguish them from each other. Catoptric lights admit of nine\r\nseparate distinctions:—1, fixed; 2, revolving white; 3, revolving red and\r\nwhite; 4, revolving red with two whites; 5, revolving white with two reds;\r\n6, flashing; 7, intermittent; 8, double fixed lights; 9, double revolving\r\nwhite lights. Mr. Stevenson thus defines their distinctive features:—“The\r\nfirst exhibits a steady and uniform appearance which is not subject to any\r\nchange, and the reflectors used for it are of smaller dimensions than\r\nthose employed in revolving lights. This is necessary in order to permit\r\nthem to be ranged round the circular frame, with their axes inclined at\r\nsuch an angle as shall enable them to illuminate every point of the\r\nhorizon. The _revolving_ light is produced by the revolution of a frame\r\nwith three or four sides, having reflectors of a larger size grouped on\r\neach side with their axes parallel, and as the revolution exhibits once in\r\ntwo minutes or once in a minute, as may be required, a light gradually\r\nincreasing to full strength and in the same gradual manner decreasing to\r\ntotal darkness, its appearance is extremely well marked. The succession of\r\nred and white lights is produced by the revolution of a frame whose\r\ndifferent sides present red and white lights, and these afford three\r\nseparate distinctions, namely, alternate red and white, the succession of\r\ntwo white lights after one red, and the succession of two red lights after\r\none white light. The flashing light is produced in the same manner as the\r\nrevolving light; but, owing to a different construction of the frame, the\r\nreflectors on each of eight sides are arranged with their rims or faces in\r\none vertical plane, and their axes in a line inclined to the\r\nperpendicular. A disposition of the mirrors, which, together with the\r\ngreater quickness of the revolutions, which shows a flash once in five\r\nseconds of time, produces a very striking effect, totally different from\r\nthat of a revolving light, and presenting the appearance of the flash\r\nalternately rising and sinking, the brightest and darkest periods being\r\nbut momentary; this light is further characterised by a rapid succession\r\nof bright flashes, from which it gets its name. The intermittent light is\r\ndistinguished by bursting suddenly into view and continuing steady for a\r\nshort time, after which it is suddenly eclipsed for half a minute. Its\r\nstriking appearance is produced by the perpendicular motion of circular\r\nshades in front of the reflectors, by which the light is alternately hid\r\nand displayed. This distinction, as well as that called the flashing\r\nlight, is peculiar to the Scotch coast. The double lights (which are\r\nseldom used except where there is a necessity for a _leading_ line, as a\r\nguide for taking some channel or avoiding some danger) are generally\r\nexhibited from two towers, one of which is higher than the other. At the\r\nGulf of Man a striking variety has been introduced into the character of\r\nleading lights, by substituting for two fixed lights two lights which\r\nrevolve in the same periods and exhibit their flashes at the same instant;\r\nand these lights are of course susceptible of the other variety enumerated\r\nabove, that of two revolving red and white lights, or flashing lights,\r\ncoming into view at equal intervals of time. The utility of all these\r\ndistinctions is to be valued with reference to their property of at once\r\nstriking the eye of an observer and being instantaneously obvious to\r\nstrangers. The introduction of colour as a source of distinction is\r\nnecessary in order to obtain a sufficient number of distinctions; but it\r\nis in itself an evil of no small magnitude, as the effect is produced by\r\ninterposing coloured media between the burner and the observer’s eye, and\r\nmuch light is thus lost by the absorption of those rays which are held\r\nback in order to cause the appearance which is desired. Trial has been\r\nmade of various colours, but red, blue, and green alone have been found\r\nuseful, and the two latter only at distances so short as to render them\r\naltogether unfit for sea-lights. Owing to the depth of tint which is\r\nrequired to produce a marked effect, the red shades generally used absorb\r\nfrom four-sevenths to five-sixths of the whole light—an enormous loss, and\r\nsufficient to discourage the adoption of that mode of distinction in every\r\nsituation where it can possibly be avoided. The red glass used in France\r\nabsorbs only four-sevenths of the light, but its colour produces, as might\r\nbe expected, a much less marked distinction to the seaman’s eye. In the\r\nlighthouses of Scotland a simple and convenient arrangement exists for\r\ncolouring the lights, which consists in using chimneys of red glass,\r\ninstead of placing large discs in front of the reflectors.”\r\n\r\nThe construction of the lantern is a point of importance; and one of the\r\nfirst order will cost about £1,260. On the level of the top of the lower\r\nglass a narrow gangway is usually built for the keeper to stand upon in\r\norder to clean the panes, an operation which in snowy weather may have to\r\nbe frequently repeated during the night. At some of the lighthouses on the\r\nMediterranean the lantern is at certain seasons so completely covered with\r\nmoths as to obscure the light and to require the attendance of men with\r\nbrooms. Mr. Tomlinson was informed by the keepers at the Eddystone that\r\nbees and other insects were much attracted by the light, and collected\r\nround the lantern in great numbers. Larks and other birds flew against it,\r\nand, becoming stunned with the blow, were picked up on the balcony and\r\nwere cooked by the men for breakfast. The lantern is very liable to injury\r\nin high winds, or the glass may be broken by large sea-birds coming\r\nagainst it on a stormy night, or by small stones violently driven against\r\nit by the wind. Extra plates of glass are always kept to take the place of\r\nbroken panes. The number of light-keepers employed varies, ranging from\r\ntwo to four, and in the latter case one is usually allowed to remain on\r\nshore, the men taking the privilege in turns. When the situation admits,\r\nit is usual to have the keeper’s rooms in a building outside the\r\nlighthouse to avoid dust, which is most injurious to the delicate\r\napparatus of the light-room. Great cleanliness is enforced in all that\r\nbelongs to a lighthouse, the reflectors and lenses being constantly\r\nburnished, polished, and cleansed.\r\n\r\nAnd so we have traced the history and progress of lighthouses, and it is\r\nhard to believe that any great change can be advantageously made in their\r\nconstruction, though their mode of illumination will doubtless be greatly\r\nimproved. As we have seen, the electric light was used practically in a\r\nlighthouse long before it was in the streets of the great metropolis, and\r\nnot in a merely experimental way, but with the most successful results.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: BREAKWATER AT VENICE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                             THE BREAKWATER.\r\n\r\n\r\n      Breakwaters, Ancient and Modern—Origin and History of that at\r\n       Cherbourg—Stones Sunk in Wooden Cones—Partial Failure of the\r\n        Plan—Millions of Tons dropped to the Bottom—The Breakwater\r\n    Temporarily Abandoned—Completed by Napoleon III.—A Port Bristling\r\n         with Guns—Rennie’s Plymouth Breakwater—Ingenious Mode of\r\n       Depositing the Stones—Lessons of the Sea—The Waves the Best\r\n        Workmen—Completion of the Work—Grand Double Breakwater at\r\n          Portland—The English Cherbourg—A Magnificent Piece of\r\n    Engineering—Utilisation of Otherwise Worthless Stone—900 Convicts\r\n      at Work—The Great Fortifications—The Verne—Gibraltar at Home—A\r\n    Gigantic Fosse—Portland almost Impregnable—Breakwaters Elsewhere.\r\n\r\n\r\nA breakwater, we are told on the highest authority, is an obstruction of\r\nwood, stone, or other material, as a boom or raft of wood, sunken vessels,\r\n&c., placed before the entrance of a port or harbour, or any projection\r\nfrom the land into the sea, as a mole, pier, or jetty, so situated as to\r\nbreak the force of the waves and prevent damage to shipping lying at\r\nanchor within them. Thus the piers of the ancient Piræus and of Rhodes;\r\nthe moles of Venice, Naples, Genoa, and Castellamare; the piers of\r\nRamsgate, Margate, Folkestone, Howth, and the famous wooden dike thrown\r\nacross the port of Rochelle. The term, of late years, has been almost\r\nexclusively applied to insulated dikes of stone. Of this description of\r\ndike for creating an artificial harbour on a grand scale, Cherbourg,\r\nPlymouth, and Portland present leading examples. The former, already\r\nmentioned in this work, claims our attention.\r\n\r\nThe French, happily our good friends to-day, were not always so, and there\r\nwas a period when the splendid natural harbours, bays, and roadsteads of\r\nthis country were a source of annoyance to them. While nature had been\r\nmore than kind to us, their coast presented a series of sandy shores,\r\nintermingled with iron-bound coasts, bristling with rocks. De Vauban, the\r\ngreat engineer, was employed by Louis, the _Grand Monarque_, to inspect\r\nthe Channel shores of France, and his natural sagacity and great knowledge\r\ncaused him at once to select Cherbourg as one of the best points for\r\nforming an artificial harbour, protected by suitable fortifications. Other\r\nengineers recommended the same port, and one, M. de la Bretonnière,\r\nproposed that a number of old ships should be loaded with stones and sunk,\r\nwhile a large quantity of stone should be also thrown around them to form\r\na grand breakwater, which should rise fifty feet from the bottom. This\r\nidea was abandoned, as it appears, partly from the fact that France had\r\nnot old vessels enough to spare for the purpose, and that it would cost\r\ntoo much to purchase them from foreign nations.\r\n\r\nIn 1781 an eminent French engineer proposed that, instead of one\r\ncontinuous breakwater, a number of large masses or congregations of\r\nstones, separated from each other on the surfaces but touching at the\r\nbases, should be built on the sea bottom, believing that they would break\r\nthe force of the waves almost equally well. As a part of his plan he\r\nsuggested that they should be sunk in large conical _caissons_ of wood,\r\n150 feet in diameter at the base and sixty feet broad at the top. These\r\nwooden cones were practically to bind and keep the stones together. They\r\nwere to be floated to the site with a number of empty casks attached as\r\nfloats, then detached, filled with stones, and sunk. An experiment at\r\nHavre having been considered satisfactory, the Government accepted the\r\nidea, and ordered that operations should be immediately commenced at\r\nCherbourg. A permanent council was appointed, as were officers and\r\nengineers. In 1783 barracks and a navy-yard were built, and at Becquet, a\r\nshort distance from Cherbourg, an artificial harbour, capable of holding\r\neighty small vessels for the transport of the stone, was literally dug\r\nout.\r\n\r\nOn June 6th, 1784, the first cone was floated to its destination, and a\r\nmonth later a second was similarly conveyed, in the presence of 10,000\r\nspectators. Before the latter could be filled with stones a storm, which\r\nlasted five days, half demolished it. In the course of the summer and\r\nautumn not less than 65,000 tons of stone were deposited in and around the\r\ncones. In 1785 several more cones were completed and sunk; at the end of\r\nthe year the quantity of stone deposited amounted to a quarter of a\r\nmillion tons, and at the end of 1787 a million tons. At the end of 1790,\r\nwhen the works had been seven years in progress and the Government was\r\ngetting very tired of the whole matter, between five and six million tons\r\nof stone had been dropped into the sea. M. de Cessart, the engineer, found\r\nthat, in order to sink five cones per annum, he had to employ 250\r\ncarpenters, 30 blacksmiths, 200 stone-hewers, and 200 masons.\r\n\r\nOne could hardly expect much permanency from a wooden covering sunk into\r\nthe sea, and it is not surprising that, one by one, they burst, few\r\nlasting more than a year. The outbreak of the Revolution put an end, for\r\nsome time, to the operations at Cherbourg.\r\n\r\nWhen the construction of the Cherbourg breakwater was resumed, the wooden\r\ncone system was abandoned, and the stone was simply sunk from vessels of\r\npeculiar construction. The breakwater was completed under Napoleon III.,\r\nat a cost exceeding two and a half million pounds sterling. The actual\r\nbreakwater itself was finished in 1853,(61) but since that time most\r\nimportant fortifications have been constructed on the upper works. This is\r\nthe greatest breakwater in the world, its length being nearly two and a\r\nhalf miles; it is 300 feet wide at the base and 31 at the top. The\r\nwater-space shut in and protected is about 2,000 acres, much of this great\r\narea being, however, too shallow for very large vessels.\r\n\r\nTaken in connection with the fortifications, this breakwater has a value\r\ngreater than any other in the world. At the apex of the angle formed by\r\nthe junction of the two branches of the breakwater there is a grand fort,\r\nand it bristles generally with batteries and forts, as indeed does\r\nCherbourg generally. Dr. W. H. Russell wrote of it, in our leading journal\r\nin 1860 that, “Wherever you look you fancy that on the spot you occupy are\r\nspecially pointed dozens of the dull black eyes from their rigid lids of\r\nstone.” With its twenty-four regular forts and redoubts, not including\r\nthose on the mole, floating harbours, building slips, navy-yards,\r\narsenals, and barracks, Cherbourg is a most formidable place.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: CHERBOURG, FROM THE SEA.]\r\n\r\nIn England Rennie’s great Plymouth breakwater is the most remarkable\r\nspecimen, among many others. Its dimensions are not as great as that of\r\nCherbourg, but it was, nevertheless, a vast undertaking. It consists of an\r\nimmense number of blocks of stone thrown into the Sound, and forms a\r\nbarrier nearly a mile in length above the surface of the water. This grand\r\nwork was commenced in 1812, and by the end of the second year about 800\r\nyards of the breakwater began to appear at low water, and the swell was so\r\nmuch broken that ships of all sizes began to take shelter behind it; while\r\nthe fishermen within its shelter could not judge accurately of the weather\r\noutside the Sound, so great was the change. Several limestone quarries\r\nnear the Catwater were purchased of the Duke of Bedford for £10,000, and\r\nsome fifteen vessels were constantly employed in removing the blocks,\r\nwhich ranged in weight from one to ten tons. These vessels were of\r\ningenious construction; they had two railways laid along them parallel to\r\neach other, with openings in the stern to admit the cars or trucks laden\r\nwith stones. These were wheeled from the quarry to the quay, and so on to\r\nthe vessels, till the lines of rails were filled with trucks. The vessels\r\nthen proceeded to the works, each bearing its load of stone-laden trucks.\r\nOn reaching the breakwater each truck was wheeled to the opening, and the\r\nstones tipped into the sea. During the first five years the amount of\r\nstone deposited gradually rose from 16,000 to 300,000 tons per annum. The\r\nlarge masses were first lowered, and then smaller stones, quarry rubbish,\r\n&c., to fill up the interstices. The structure was completed in 1841, with\r\nthe use of 3,670,444 tons of stone(62) and at a cost of something like a\r\nmillion and a half of money. A distinguished French engineer, M. Dupin,\r\nwho visited the works during their progress, describes in glowing terms\r\nthe admirable arrangements, the order and regularity visible in all the\r\nproceedings. “Those enormous masses of stone,” he remarks, “which the\r\nquarrymen strike with heavy strokes of their hammers; and those aerial\r\nroads of flying bridges, which serve for the removal of the superstratum\r\nof earth; those lines of cranes, all at work at the same moment; the\r\ntrucks, all in motion; the arrival, the loading, and the departure of the\r\nvessels, all this forms one of the most imposing sights that can strike a\r\nfriend to the great works of art. At fixed hours the sound of a bell is\r\nheard, in order to announce the blasting of the quarry. The operations\r\ninstantly cease on all sides; all becomes silence and solitude. This\r\nuniversal silence renders still more imposing the noise of the explosion,\r\nthe splitting of the rocks, their ponderous fall, and the prolonged sound\r\nof the echoes.”\r\n\r\n“The waves,” said Rennie, “were the best workmen” in the construction of a\r\nbreakwater of rough stones, and on the whole his belief was confirmed, for\r\nthe storms by which his great work was assailed rather helped than\r\nhindered it, by showing the most desirable slope on the sea-side, while\r\ncomparatively little damage was done. The slope of the stone barrier was,\r\nhowever, by their force changed very greatly. An inclination of three to\r\none was altered to about five to one, and Rennie had recommended that the\r\nauthorities should take a lesson from nature and finish the breakwater\r\naccording to her teachings. “It would appear,” says Mr. Smiles,(63) “that\r\nMr. Whidbey, the resident engineer, contrived to finish most of the\r\nexterior face at a slope of only three to one, as before; and that it\r\nstood without any material interruption until several years after Mr.\r\nRennie’s death. By that time nearly the whole of the intended rubble,\r\namounting to 2,381,321 tons, had been deposited, and the main arm, with\r\n200 yards of the west arm, making 1,241 yards in length, had been raised\r\nto the required level. The work had arrived at that stage when it had to\r\nexperience the full force of another terrific storm, which took place on\r\nthe 23rd of November, 1824. It blew at first from the south-south-east and\r\nthen veered round to the south-west, and the effect of this concurrence of\r\nwinds was to heap together the waters of the Channel between Bolt Head and\r\nLizard Point, and drive them, with terrific force, into the narrow inlet\r\nof Plymouth Sound. This storm was not only greatly more violent, but of\r\nmuch longer duration than that of 1817. When the breakwater could be\r\nexamined it was found that out of the 1,241 yards of the upper part, which\r\nhad been completed with a slope of three to one, 796 yards had been\r\naltered as in the previous storm, and the immense blocks of stone which\r\nformed the seaface of the work had, by the force of the waves, been rolled\r\nover to the landward sides thus reducing the sea-slope, as before, to\r\nabout five to one. The accuracy of Mr. Rennie’s view as to the proper\r\nslope—which was indicated by the action of the sea itself—was thus a\r\nsecond time confirmed;” and a board of eminent engineers reporting in\r\naccordance, the work was so finished. When the action of the sea had\r\nformed its own slope and had wedged together and settled the great mass of\r\nmaterials which form the breakwater, and when no further movement was\r\napparent, but the whole appeared consolidated together, then the slope\r\ntowards the sea was cased with regular courses of masonry, dove-tailed and\r\ncramped together, the diving-bell being brought into requisition for\r\nplacing the lower courses. A lighthouse has been erected on its western\r\nextremity, and the work may be regarded as a magnificent success, worthy\r\nof a great maritime nation.\r\n\r\nA third leading illustration of a magnificent breakwater is afforded at\r\nPortland, and it is deserving of particular mention inasmuch as all\r\nauthorities agree that it was constructed with little or no waste of the\r\npublic money. “In the mind of the inquiring tax-payer,” said our leading\r\njournal,(64) “breakwaters are always associated with millions of money\r\nthrown broadcast into the sea, in out-of-the-way bays and inlets, which\r\neven without these obstacles to make them more dangerous, the most\r\ndistressed mariner would be particularly careful to avoid;” and the writer\r\ngoes on to mention several which either ought not to have been attempted,\r\nor where extravagant expenditure has been incurred. “In such a woeful list\r\nof hideous failure and costly mismanagement, it is a comfort to perceive\r\nthat the long lane begins to turn at last, and that from our now having\r\none good standard to go by, we may hope for better things for the future.\r\nPortland breakwater is a really grand and magnificent work, and one of\r\nwhich the nation may well be proud if it is inclined to let bygones be\r\nbygones, and forget the many successive failures before it was able to\r\nattain so much.” Portland breakwater is the right construction in the\r\nright place, and before its erection the Roads afforded doubtful shelter\r\nto vessels in distress. One advantage it enjoys, that of possessing a\r\nsplendid anchorage of stiff blue clay, and being free from rock or shoal\r\nfrom the island of Portland itself up to the very esplanade of Weymouth.\r\nThere, too, was the stone on the very spot; steep and rugged heights for\r\nfortifications, a noble harbour for shipping, and rail communication with\r\nall parts. But all these advantages might have been ignored but for the\r\nformidable nature of the works constructed at Cherbourg. The port itself\r\nis about five hours’ steaming from the French Cronstadt it was designed,\r\n_sub rosâ_, to keep an eye upon. So, in 1844, the commissioners\r\nrecommended that it should be made a grand fortified naval station. In\r\n1847 an Act was passed authorising the construction of a breakwater, and\r\nin 1849 the foundation-stone was laid by the Prince Consort.\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: PORTLAND.]\r\n\r\nNature has provided, in the mighty bank known as the Chesil Beach,\r\npractically a great shingle embankment, protection to Portland Harbour on\r\nthe west and south-west, and the object of the breakwater was to secure,\r\nby engineering art, a similar protection to the bay on the south-east\r\nside. The Chesil Bank, though now and for long perfectly impregnable to\r\nthe tremendous rollers of the south-westerly gales, was not always so, and\r\nas late as the reign of Henry VIII, great breaches had been temporarily\r\neffected by the power of the sea. Still it affords a splendid protection,\r\nas does now the mighty double breakwater designed by Rendel, and brought\r\nto completion by Coode. The breakwater leaves the shore at the\r\nnorth-eastern extremity of the island, and runs out due east to a distance\r\nof 600 yards. “This inner limb alone,” wrote an authority in\r\nengineering,(65) “is a splendid achievement of human labour and skill. It\r\nhas been top-finished by a grand superstructure of hewn granite, and ends\r\nin a circular head, which has been completed as a fort and mounts eight\r\nguns. The foundations of this massive bastion have been most carefully\r\nplanned, with especial reference to the safe passage of the largest\r\nvessels through the 400 feet gap which the fort flanks on one side. The\r\nmasonry is continued in a perpendicular line to a point 25 feet below the\r\nlowest water-line of spring-tides. A ship of the line, as is well-known,\r\ndraws at the utmost 24 feet. An extra foot of perpendicular masonry,\r\ntherefore, having been allowed, the lower masses of the fort begin to\r\nslant outwards, and continue to do so till they reach the firm clay\r\nbottom. This lower portion consists of a well-consolidated mass of unhewn\r\nstone. The outer, and by far the longer limb, of the breakwater begins to\r\nbend away to a point very near due north shortly after leaving the gap,\r\nthe further side of which is also flanked by a circular head.... The whole\r\nof this vast outer limb, with the exception of the circular head at its\r\ninner extremity and a fort at the other end, consists of nothing more than\r\na stupendous bank of rough unhewn stones of all shapes and sizes, tumbled\r\nout of the wagons on the timber staging above. Divers, constantly\r\nemployed, have effectually prevented the chance of any holes being left in\r\nthe rising mass, and have been able to indicate the precise spot over\r\nwhich a given number of loads were required to be ‘tipped.’ The security\r\nof the bank is further guaranteed by its enormous width at the base; and\r\nalthough the waves have already rounded many a giant block below the\r\nwater-line and made it look as if its present place had been its abode\r\never since the Creation, yet this polishing and grinding is the extent of\r\nthe effect which they will be able to produce upon a work probably\r\ndestined to hold its own as long as Portland itself.”\r\n\r\nThe rapidity with which the breakwater was constructed reflected great\r\ncredit on Mr. Coode. The actual routine of the construction followed, when\r\nthe line for the structure had been sounded and carefully marked out, was\r\nto commence piling for the railway that was to carry the long trains of\r\nwagons filled with the stone; and when a short piece of this was\r\ncompleted, to go on “tipping in” the rubble and rough stone till they made\r\ntheir appearance above water at last; then the piling was carried forward\r\na few yards more, and the process repeated, and so on by successive stages\r\nto the completion of the work. All appears very simple on paper until we\r\nlearn that it had to be accomplished through eleven fathoms of rough\r\ntumbling waves. One night’s rough weather often swept away the timber-work\r\nthat cost many thousands of pounds, and many months of labour to construct\r\nand fix in its position in the sea. The piling that had to resist the\r\naction of a deep and heavy sea, and to carry also, at a height of 90 feet,\r\na railway for the heaviest traffic, required to be something more than a\r\ncommon framework of timber. Every log used had to be first of all\r\nsaturated to its very centre with creosote, and this was done in a most\r\ningenious manner. A great boiler, 100 feet long and 7 feet in diameter,\r\nwas filled with the largest and finest logs procurable; the mouth being\r\nclosed with a solid air-tight cover, the air was pumped out, not only from\r\nthe tube, but from the very pores of the wood itself. When the vacuum was\r\nas complete as possible, the creosote was admitted from tanks at the\r\nbottom and forced into the timber by hydraulic power of about 300 lbs. to\r\nthe square inch. In this the logs remained for two or three days, by which\r\ntime the creosote was forced into the fibre of the wood. Several of the\r\nlogs thus prepared were bolted and bound together, till one huge spar 90\r\nfeet long, and eight or nine tons in weight, was formed. Then an iron\r\n“Mitchell” screw—as used in the lighthouses built on sands, already\r\ndescribed—was affixed at the lower end, and the whole sunk till it rested\r\non the bottom, when it was worked round by a capstan till it was firmly\r\nscrewed into the clay. Thus secured, they were tolerably safe, though\r\nsingle heavy waves would uproot piles and moorings together, to obviate\r\nwhich two or three piles were generally set at the same time, and well\r\nbound together by powerful cross timbers.\r\n\r\nThe stone quarried for the breakwater from the very top of Portland Island\r\nwas largely excavated and brought to the spot by convict labour. The stone\r\nitself used was unfit for architectural purposes, but quite suitable for\r\nthe breakwater. The convict prison, also on the top of the island, was\r\nvirtually the barracks for 900 labourers, who were more profitably\r\nemployed than in walking a treadmill or picking oakum. The quarries were\r\nsome 400 or 500 feet above the level of the breakwater, and the stone was\r\nconveyed to it by three inclines of broad double gauge rails. The trains\r\nof trucks or wagons were worked up and down with a wire rope over a drum,\r\nthe weight of the loaded descending wagons winding the empty ones up again\r\nto the quarries. A powerful locomotive pushed the loaded trains to the end\r\nof the work, where the stone was tipped into the sea, as much as 3,000\r\ntons a day having been sunk at Portland. The total amount so committed to\r\nthe deep was about 5,360,000 tons, and the area protected by the\r\nbreakwater would accommodate sixty of the very largest men-of-war, and\r\nalmost any number of smaller vessels.\r\n\r\n“During the progress of the works,” wrote Mr. Moule, “the engineer has\r\nfrom time to time instituted some highly interesting investigations into\r\nthe structure of the Chesil Bank.... During a single night’s gale, between\r\nthree and four _millions of tons_ weight of pebbles have been found to be\r\nswept away into the gulfs of the Atlantic, being gradually thrown back\r\nagain in the three or four following days. The size of the pebbles had\r\nlong been observed to vary greatly at the two opposite ends of the beach.\r\nAt the western, or Abbotsbury end, they are exceedingly small, more\r\nresembling gravel than shingle. At the Portland end it is not uncommon to\r\nmeet with them several inches in diameter, and several pounds in weight.\r\nThis phenomenon has been explained by the very probable assumption that\r\nthe pebbles are driven eastward by the wind-waves, and not moved by the\r\nslow and (for purposes like this) powerless tidal current. The larger\r\npebbles, presenting a broad surface to the waves, are easily rolled\r\nforward, while the smaller ones are passed by, offering a less surface,\r\nand becoming more easily imbedded in the sand.” It is said that a\r\npractised smuggler on that coast could tell his whereabouts on the bank in\r\nthe darkest night or thickest fog, by feeling the size of the pebbles on\r\nwhich he stood. And smugglers and “wreckers” were once very numerous among\r\nthe Portlanders. In these better days their courage and great personal\r\nstrength has saved many a life and ship endangered off the bank.\r\n\r\nAn old and popular song says that—\r\n\r\n  “Britannia needs no bulwarks,\r\n  No towers along the steep,”\r\n\r\nbut recent legislators have evidently not been so thoroughly satisfied of\r\nthe fact, or they would not have authorised the construction of the great\r\nfortifications at Portland, which make it almost the Gibraltar of the\r\nChannel. The splendid breakwater there did not need protection. All the\r\nbattering it is ever likely to get could not injure it seriously, and\r\nwhatever ruins Macaulay’s New Zealander may stand upon, they are not\r\nlikely to be those of a great breakwater, each year of the existence of\r\nwhich renders it generally more compact. But it was for good reasons that\r\nthe extensive works of Portland were undertaken. “We,” said the _Times_,\r\n“of all people in the world, who so toiled and suffered, lavishing blood\r\nand treasure under the walls of Sebastopol, should be the last to\r\nunderrate the importance of a good fortification as a check to an invading\r\narmy.” The reader will hardly require any defence of such policy, for\r\nnaval arsenals contain the very germ of our power, as the iron safe of the\r\nprudent man contains his valuables.\r\n\r\nThe Bill of Portland greatly resembles the situation of Gibraltar. There\r\nare the same bold, steep, rocky headlands; the breakwater stands in place\r\nof the Mole, and Chesil Bank connects it with the mainland, as the neutral\r\nground does our great Mediterranean citadel with Spanish soil. “Its\r\nheight, its isolation, and the harbour it commands, all pointed it out as\r\na place for an impregnable—we had almost said an inaccessible—fortress. To\r\nthe late Prince Consort is due the credit of having seen its vast\r\nimportance in this respect, as it was also owing to his enlightened\r\njudgment that the breakwater was begun at last, and he himself laid the\r\nfoundation-stone. Portland is rising, as we have said, into a first-class\r\nfortress, of which the Verne is the great key or citadel.” So spoke the\r\n_Times_, in 1863; and now Portland is the best fortified port and naval\r\nstation in the kingdom.\r\n\r\nThe Verne is a height which, like La Roche at Cherbourg, dominates over\r\nall around it for miles, especially on the side which overlooks the\r\nbreakwater and the sea. On the north side it is protected by nearly\r\nperpendicular cliffs; elsewhere it is fully protected by art. One of its\r\ngreatest defences is the dry ditch which completely encircles the whole\r\nwork, except on the north side just mentioned, where it is both\r\nunnecessary and impossible. This ditch is one of the greatest ever\r\nundertaken in ancient or modern days. Its depth is 80 feet, and its width\r\n100, and in some places 200 feet; its length is nearly a mile, and its\r\nfloor is 368 feet up the hill-side. Nearly two million tons of stone had\r\nto be blasted to form it; and it would never have been excavated on the\r\ncolossal scale indicated, but that all the said stone was utilised in\r\nbuilding the breakwater. With this tremendous artificial ravine to cross,\r\nwith fortifications and bastions fully prepared with heavy Armstrong\r\nordnance towering above, what enemy is ever likely to attack the citadel\r\nof the Verne? Our leading journal spoke of it as more compact than\r\nCherbourg, Cronstadt, or Sebastopol, while it is more than three times\r\ntheir elevation above the sea.\r\n\r\nJutting out from the main fortress are two bastionettes, one of which has\r\neight faces, mounting guns on each so as to sweep with a murderous fire\r\ntwo-thirds of the whole length of the fosse or ditch. The other is nearly\r\nas formidable, and both are pierced with loop-holes in all directions for\r\nthe fire of riflemen. The great barracks in the enclosure of the Verne\r\ncan, at a pinch, accommodate 10,000 men, the peace garrison being about a\r\nthird of that number. The arrangements for water supply are perfect, great\r\nreserve tanks having been cut from the solid rock, and covered with\r\nshot-proof roofs. These are kept full, and, protected from air and light;\r\nthe water is always sweet. Portland bristles with batteries; but the Verne\r\ncommands everything in range of cannon, inside or outside the breakwater,\r\nincluding all parts of the island, and can cross fire with other important\r\nforts. It is probably the strongest fortified harbour in the world.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: HOLYHEAD BREAKWATER.]\r\n\r\nOther and important breakwaters, like that of Holyhead, which cost a\r\ncouple of million sterling, and which is generally cited as an example of\r\nmuch money thrown into the sea; Alderney, which has swallowed up close on\r\nthree-fourths of the above sum; and Dover, which has a fine _vertical_\r\nsea-wall, might be mentioned. Enough has been said to show the general\r\nimportance of the subject to a maritime people, and that, on the whole,\r\nEngland has been fully alive to the fact. Indeed, counting large and small\r\nbreakwaters and sea-walls, more has been expended in this country for\r\nthese works than in any two or three foreign countries possessing\r\nsea-boards.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                  THE GREATEST STORM IN ENGLISH HISTORY.\r\n\r\n\r\n       The Dangers of the Seas—England’s Interest in the Matter—The\r\n     Shipping and Docks of London and Liverpool—The Goodwin Sands and\r\n       their History—The “Hovellers”—The Great Gale of 1703—Defoe’s\r\n     Graphic Account—Thirteen Vessels of the Royal Navy Lost—Accounts\r\n    of Eye-witnesses—The Storm Universal over England—Great Damage and\r\n      Loss of Life at Bristol—Plymouth—Portsmouth—Vessels Driven to\r\n     Holland—At the Spurn Light—Inhumanity of Deal Townsmen—A worthy\r\n    Mayor Saves 200 Lives—The Damage in the Thames—Vessels Drifting in\r\n        all Directions—800 Boats Lost—Loss of Life on the River—On\r\n     Shore—Remarkable Escapes and Casualties—London in a Condition of\r\n      Wreck—Great Damage to Churches—A Bishop and his Lady Killed—A\r\n               Remarkable Water-Spout—Total Losses Fearful.\r\n\r\n\r\n“The dangers of the seas” are little enough to some countries, but to\r\nEngland they mean much indeed. Think of the maritime interests of the port\r\nof London, the docks of which cover considerably over 300 acres of\r\nwater-space, and to which 7,000 or more vessels enter annually. Over 100\r\nvessels, exclusive of small craft, enter the port daily; its exports form\r\nnearly one-fourth of the total exports of the United Kingdom. Liverpool in\r\nsome maritime interests excels it. This, the second largest city in Great\r\nBritain, had, as late as 1697, a population of only 5,000; 80 small\r\nvessels then belonged to the port. In this year of grace, Liverpool, with\r\nher virtual suburbs, Birkenhead and West Derby, has a population\r\nconsiderably over 700,000. In 1872, Liverpool exported, in British and\r\nIrish productions, a total value of £100,066,410, which meant little short\r\nof forty per cent. of the total exports, of the same kind, from the United\r\nKingdom, while its imports of many staples exceeded those of London.\r\nLiverpool has nearly sixty docks and basins, extending along the Mersey\r\nfor five miles. She possesses nineteen miles of quays, nearly the whole of\r\nwhich have been built since 1812, and warehouses on a scale of\r\nmagnificence unknown elsewhere.\r\n\r\nBut such a commerce means much more. Hundreds of thousands of hardy men\r\nrisk their lives that we may have bread and butter, sugar with our tea,\r\nand all the necessaries and luxuries of modern civilised life. England has\r\nnot forgotten them, and for their use has built the lighthouse, the\r\nbreakwater, and the harbour of refuge. But there are sources of danger\r\nwhich nearly defy human power. Take, among all dangerous shoals and sands,\r\nthe Goodwin Sands as a prominent example; they are replete with danger to\r\nall sailing vessels at least, resorting to the Thames or to the North Sea,\r\nwhile even steamships have been lost on their treacherous banks.\r\n\r\nThese Sands, so well known to, and feared by, the mariner, are ten miles\r\nin length, running in a north-east and south-west direction off the east\r\ncoast of Kent. They are divided into two portions by a narrow channel, and\r\nparts are uncovered at low water. When the tide recedes, the sand is firm\r\nand safe, but when the sea permeates it, the mass becomes pulpy,\r\ntreacherous, and constantly shifting. Three light-vessels (one seven miles\r\nfrom Ramsgate) mark the most dangerous points, and these are themselves\r\nexposed to a considerable amount of danger. The only advantage derived\r\nfrom the existence of the Sands is that they form a kind of breakwater,\r\nsecuring a safe anchorage in the roadsteads of the Downs. But if the wind\r\nblows strongly off shore, let the mariner beware!\r\n\r\nThe ancients thought that Britain was distinguished from all the world by\r\nunpassable seas and northern winds. The shores of Albion were dreadful to\r\nsailors, and our island was for a time regarded as the utmost bounds of\r\nthe northern known land, beyond which none had ever sailed.\r\n\r\nThese dangerous Goodwin Sands, if we may believe the chronicles, and there\r\nseems no reason why we should not, consisted at one time of about 4,000\r\nacres of low coast land, fenced from the sea by a wall. One tradition, not\r\nusually credited, ascribes their present state to the erection of the\r\nTenterden Steeple, by which the funds which should have maintained the\r\nsea-wall were diverted. An old authority, Lambard, says, “Whatsoever old\r\nwives tell of Goodwyne, Earle of Kent, in tyme of Edward the Confessour,\r\nand his sandes, it appeareth by Hector Boëtius, the Brittish chronicler,\r\nthat theise sandes weare mayne land, and some tyme of the possession of\r\nEarl Goodwyne, and by a great inundation of the sea, they weare taken\r\ntherefroe, at which tyme also much harme was done in Scotland and\r\nFlanders, by the same rage of the water.” At the period of the Conquest,\r\nthese lands were taken from Earl Goodwin and bestowed on the abbey of St.\r\nAugustine, Canterbury, and some accounts say that the Abbot allowed the\r\nsea-wall to become dilapidated, and that in the year 1100 the waves rushed\r\nin and overwhelmed the whole. The inroads of the sea in many parts of the\r\nworld would account for anything of the kind.\r\n\r\nIn dangerous or foggy weather, bells are constantly sounded from the\r\nlight-ships. A considerable amount of difficulty is experienced in finding\r\nproper anchorage for these vessels; and all efforts to establish a fixed\r\nbeacon have been hitherto unsuccessful. In 1846 a lighthouse on piles\r\n_screwed_ into the sands(66) was erected, but it was carried away the\r\nfollowing year by the force of the waves. As soon as a vessel is known to\r\nhave been driven on the Goodwins, rockets are thrown up from the\r\nlight-ships, and as soon as recognised on shore a number of boatmen, known\r\nas “hovellers,” all over that portion of the coast, immediately launch\r\ntheir boats, and make for the Sands, whatever may be the weather. The\r\n“hovellers” look upon the wreck itself as in part their property, and make\r\na good deal of money at times, leading, as a rule, a thoroughly reckless\r\nsailor’s life ashore. But how many poor seamen have had cause to bless\r\ntheir bravery and intrepidity!\r\n\r\nThe great gale of 1703, one of the most terrible, if not absolutely _the_\r\nmost terrible which has ever visited our coasts, occasioned the loss of\r\nthirteen vessels of the Royal Navy, four on the Goodwin Sands, one in the\r\nYarmouth Roads, one at the Nore, and the rest at various points on the\r\ncoasts of England and Holland. The record, as preserved by the immortal\r\nauthor of “Robinson Crusoe,” is terribly concise in its details. Take a\r\npart only of it. The italics are our own.\r\n\r\n“_Reserve_, fourth-rate; 54 guns; 258 men. John Anderson, com. Lost in\r\nYarmouth Roads. The captain, purser, master, chyrurgeon, clerk, and 16 men\r\nwere ashore; _the rest drowned_.\r\n\r\n“_Northumberland_, third-rate; 70 guns; 253 men. James Greenway, com. Lost\r\non Goodwin Sands. _All their men lost._\r\n\r\n“_Restoration_, third-rate; 70 guns; 386 men. Fleetwood Emes, com. Lost on\r\nGoodwin Sands. _All their men lost._\r\n\r\n“_Sterling Castle_, third-rate; 70 guns; 349 men. John Johnson, com. Lost\r\non Goodwin Sands. Third lieutenant, chaplain, cook, chyrurgeon’s mate,\r\nfour marine captains, and 62 men saved.\r\n\r\n“_Mary_, fourth-rate; 64 guns; 273 men. Rear-Admiral Beaumont, Edward\r\nHopson, com. Lost on Goodwin Sands. _Only one man saved_, by swimming from\r\nwreck to wreck, and getting to the _Sterling Castle_; the captain ashore,\r\nas also the purser.” And so the sad story proceeds, Defoe adding that the\r\nloss of small vessels hired into the service, and tending the fleet, is\r\nnot included, several such vessels, with soldiers on board, being driven\r\nto sea, and never heard of more.(67)\r\n\r\n             [Illustration: GREAT STORM IN THE DOWNS, 1703.]\r\n\r\nA master on board a vessel which was blown “out of the Downs to Norway,”\r\ndescribes the sights he saw on those fatal days, the 25th and 26th of\r\nNovember, in homely but graphic language. He says: “By four o’clock we\r\nmiss’d the _Mary_ and the _Northumberland_, who rid not far from us, and\r\nfound they were driven from their anchors; but what became of them, God\r\nknows. And soon after, a large man-of-war came driving down upon us, all\r\nher masts gone, and in a dreadful condition. We were in the utmost despair\r\nat this sight, for we saw no avoiding her coming thwart our haiser; she\r\ndrove at last so near us, that I was just gowing to order the mate to cut\r\naway, when it pleas’d God the ship sheer’d contrary to our expectation to\r\nwindward, and the man-of-war, which we found to be the _Sterling Castle_,\r\ndrove clear of us, not two ships’ lengths, to leeward.\r\n\r\n“It was a sight full of terrible particulars to see a ship of eighty guns\r\n(_sic_) and about six hundred men(68) in that dismal case. She had cut\r\naway all her masts; the men were all in the confusion of death and\r\ndespair; she had neither anchor, nor cable, nor boat to help her, the sea\r\nbreaking over her in a terrible manner, that sometimes she seem’d all\r\nunder water. And they knew, as well as we that saw her, that they drove by\r\nthe tempest directly for the Goodwin, where they could expect nothing but\r\ndestruction. The cries of the men, and the firing their guns, one by one,\r\nevery half minute for help, terrified us in such a manner, that I think we\r\nwere half dead with the horror of it.” The same writer describes the\r\ncollision of two vessels, which he saw sink together, and several great\r\nships fast aground and beating to pieces. “One,” says he, “we saw founder\r\nbefore our eyes, and all the people perish’d.”\r\n\r\n“We have,” says Defoe, “an abundance of strange accounts from other parts,\r\nand particularly the following letter from the Downs, and though every\r\ncircumstance in this letter is not literally true, as to the number of\r\nships or lives lost, and the style coarse and sailor-like, yet I have\r\ninserted this letter, because it seems to describe the horror and\r\nconsternation the poor sailors were in at that time; and because this is\r\nwritten from one who was as near an eye-witness as any could possibly be,\r\nand be safe.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“‘SIR,—These lines I hope in God will find you in good health. We are all\r\nleft here in a dismal condition, expecting every moment to be all drowned;\r\nfor here is a great storm, and is very likely to continue. We have here\r\nthe Rear-Admiral of the Blue in the ship called the _Mary_, a third-rate,\r\nthe very next ship to ours, sunk, with Admiral Beaumont, and above 500 men\r\ndrowned; the ship called the _Northumberland_, a third-rate, about 500\r\nmen, all sunk and drowned; the ship called the _Sterling Castle_, a\r\nthird-rate, all sunk and drowned, above 500 souls; and the ship called the\r\n_Restoration_, a third-rate, all sunk and drowned. These ships were all\r\nclose by us, which I saw. These ships fired their guns all night and day\r\nlong, poor souls, for help, but the storm being so fierce and raging,\r\ncould have none to save them. The ship called the _Shrewsbury_, that we\r\nare in, broke two anchors, and did run mighty fierce backwards, within\r\nsixty or eighty yards of the Sands, and as God Almighty would have it, we\r\nflung our sheet-anchor down, which is the biggest, and so stopt; here we\r\nall prayed God to forgive us our sins, and to save us, or else to receive\r\nus into his heavenly Kingdom. If our sheet-anchor had given way, we had\r\nbeen all drowned; but I humbly thank God, it was his gracious mercy that\r\nsaved us. There’s one, Captain Fanel’s ship, three hospital ships, all\r\nsplit, some sunk, and most of the men drowned.\r\n\r\n“‘There are above forty merchant ships cast away and sunk; to see Admiral\r\nBeaumont, that was next us, and all the rest of his men, how they climbed\r\nup the main-mast, hundreds at a time crying out for help, and thinking to\r\nsave their lives, and in the twinkling of an eye were drowned; I can give\r\nyou no account, but of these four men-of-war aforesaid, which I saw with\r\nmy own eyes, and those hospital ships, at present, by reason the storm\r\nhath drove us far distant from one another; Captain Crow, of our ship,\r\nbelieves we have lost several more ships of war, by reason we see so few;\r\nwe lie here in great danger, and waiting for a north-easterly wind to\r\nbring us to Portsmouth, and it is our prayer to God for it; for we know\r\nnot how soon this storm may arise, and cut us all off, for it is a dismal\r\nplace to anchor in. I have not had my clothes off, nor a wink of sleep\r\nthese four nights, and have got my death with cold almost.—Yours to\r\ncommand,\r\n\r\n                                                  “‘MILES NORCLIFFE.’”(69)\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following is also a characteristic letter from Captain Soanes of\r\nH.M.S. _Dolphin_, then at Milford Haven, showing also how far the storm\r\nextended on our coasts:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n“_Sir_,—Reading the advertisement in the _Gazette_ of your intending to\r\nprint the many sad accidents in the late dreadful storm, induced me to let\r\nyou know what this place felt, though a very good harbour. Her Majesty’s\r\nships the _Cumberland_, _Coventry_, _Loo_, _Hastings_, and _Hector_, being\r\nunder my command, with the _Rye_, a cruiser on this station, and under our\r\nconvoy, about 130 merchant ships bound about land; the 26th of November,\r\nat one in the afternoon, the wind came at S. by E. a hard gale, between\r\nwhich and N.W. by W. it came to a dreadful storm; at three the next\r\nmorning was the violentest of the weather, when the _Cumberland_ broke her\r\nsheet-anchor, the ship driving near this, and the _Rye_ both narrowly\r\nescap’d carrying away; she drove very near the rocks, having but one\r\nanchor left, but in a little time they slung a gun, with the broken anchor\r\nfast to it, which they let go, and wonderfully preserved the ship from the\r\nshore. Guns firing from one ship or other all the night for help, though\r\n’twas impossible to assist each other, the sea was so high, and the\r\ndarkness of the night such, that we could not see where any one was, but\r\nby the flashes of the guns; when daylight appeared, it was a dismal sight\r\nto behold the ships driving up and down, one foul of another, without\r\nmasts, some sunk, and others upon the rocks, the wind blowing so hard,\r\nwith thunder, lightning, and rain, that on the deck a man could not stand\r\nwithout holding. Some drove from Dale, where they were sheltered under the\r\nland, and split in pieces, the men all drowned; two others drove out of a\r\ncreek, one on the shore so high up was saved; the other on the rocks in\r\nanother creek, and bulged; an Irish ship that lay with a rock through her,\r\nwas lifted by the sea clear away to the other side of the creek on a safe\r\nplace; one ship forced ten miles up the river before she could be stopped,\r\nand several strangely blown into holes, and on banks; a ketch, of\r\nPembroke, was drove on the rocks, the two men and a boy in her had no boat\r\nto save their lives, but in this great distress a boat which broke from\r\nanother ship drove by them, without any in her, the two men leaped into\r\nher and were saved, but the boy was drowned. A prize at Pembroke was\r\nlifted on the bridge, whereon is a mill, which the water blew up, but the\r\nvessel got off again; another vessel carried almost into the gateway which\r\nleads to the bridge, and is a road, the tide flowing several feet above\r\nthe common course. The storm continued till the 27th, about three in the\r\nafternoon; that by computation nigh thirty merchant ships and vessels\r\nwithout masts are lost, and what men are lost is not known; three ships\r\nare missing, that we suppose men and all lost. None of her Majesty’s ships\r\ncame to any harm; but the _Cumberland_ breaking her anchor in a storm\r\nwhich happen’d the 18th at night, lost another, which renders her\r\nincapable of proceeding with us till supplied. I saw several trees and\r\nhouses which are blown down.—Your humble servant,\r\n\r\n                                                            “JOS. SOANES.“\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe disasters caused by this terrible gale extended over the English\r\ncoasts. At Bristol the tide filled the merchants’ cellars, spoiling 1,000\r\nhogsheads of sugar, 1,500 hogsheads of tobacco, and any quantity of other\r\nproduce, the damage being estimated at £100,000. Eighty people were\r\ndrowned in the marshes and river. Among the shipping casualties, the\r\n_Canterbury_ store-ship went ashore, and twenty-five men were drowned from\r\nher. The Severn overflowed the country, doing great damage at Gloucester;\r\nand 15,000 sheep were drowned on the levels and marshes. Four merchant\r\nships were lost in Plymouth Roads, and most of the men were drowned. At\r\nPortsmouth a number of vessels were blown to sea, and some of them never\r\nheard of more. About a dozen ships were driven from our coasts to Holland,\r\nthe crews, for the most part, being saved. At Dunkirk, twenty-three or\r\nmore vessels were dashed to pieces against the pier-head.\r\n\r\nMr. Peter Walls, master or chief lighthouse-keeper of the Spurn Light at\r\nthe mouth of the Humber, was present on the 26th of November, the fatal\r\nnight of the storm. He thought that his lighthouse must have been blown\r\ndown, and the tempest made the fire in it burn so fiercely that “it melted\r\ndown the iron bars, on which it laid, like lead,” so that they were\r\nobliged when the fire was nearly extinguished to put in fresh bars, and\r\nre-kindle the fire, keeping it up till the morning dawn, when they found\r\nthat some six or seven-and-twenty sail of ships were driving helplessly\r\nabout the Spurn Head, some having cut, and others broken their cables.\r\nThese were a part of two fleets then lying in the Humber, having put in\r\nthere by stress of weather a day or two before. Three ships were driven on\r\nan island called the Don. The first no sooner touched bottom than she\r\ncompletely capsized, turning keel up; strange to say, out of six men on\r\nboard, only one was drowned, the other five being rescued by the boat of\r\nthe second ship. They landed at the Spurn Lighthouse, where Mr. Walls got\r\nthem good fires and all the comforts they needed. The second ship, having\r\nnobody on board, was driven to sea and never seen or heard of more. The\r\nthird broke up, and next morning some coals that had been in her were all\r\nthat was to be seen. Of the whole number of vessels in the Humber, few, if\r\nany, were saved.\r\n\r\nDefoe estimates that 150 sea-going vessels of all sorts were lost in this\r\nterrific gale; but this is, in all probability, a very low estimate. And\r\nit is as nothing to the fearful loss of life, which amounted to 8,000\r\nsouls.\r\n\r\nThe townspeople of Deal, in particular, were blamed for their inhumanity\r\nin leaving many to their fate who could have been rescued. Boatmen went\r\noff to the sands for booty, some of whom would not listen to poor wretches\r\nwho might have been saved. Many unfortunate shipwrecked persons could be\r\nseen, by the aid of glasses, walking on the Goodwin Sands in despairing\r\npostures, knowing that they would, as Defoe puts it, “be washed into\r\nanother world” at the reflux of the tide. The Mayor of Deal, Mr. Thomas\r\nPowell, asked the Custom House officers to take out their boats and\r\nendeavour to save the lives of some of these unfortunates, but they\r\nutterly refused. The mayor then offered, from his own pocket, five\r\nshillings a head for all saved, and a number of fishermen and others\r\nvolunteered, and succeeded in bringing 200 persons on shore, who would\r\nhave been lost in half an hour afterwards. The Queen’s agent for sick and\r\nwounded seamen would not furnish a penny for their lodging or food, and\r\nthe good mayor supplied all of them with what they required. Several died,\r\nand he was compelled to bury them at his own expense; he furnished a large\r\nnumber with money to pay their way to London. He received no thanks from\r\nthe Government of the day, but some long time after was re-imbursed the\r\nlarge sums he had expended.\r\n\r\n           [Illustration: THE STORM IN THE THAMES AT WAPPING.]\r\n\r\n“Nor,” says Defoe, “can the damage suffered in the river of Thames be\r\nforgot. It was a strange sight to see all the ships in the river blown\r\naway, the Pool was so clear, that, as I remember, not above four ships\r\nwere left between the upper part of Wapping and Ratcliffe Cross, for the\r\ntide being up at the time when the storm blew with the greatest violence,\r\nno anchors or landfast, no cables or moorings, would hold them, the chains\r\nwhich lay across the river for the mooring of ships, all gave way.\r\n\r\n“The ships breaking loose thus, it must be a strange sight to see the\r\nhurry and confusion of it; and, as some ships had nobody at all on board,\r\nand a great many had none but a man or boy just to look after the vessel,\r\nthere was nothing to be done but to let every vessel drive whither and how\r\nshe would.\r\n\r\n“Those who know the reaches of the river, and how they lie, know well\r\nenough that the wind being at south-west-westerly, the vessels would\r\nnaturally drive into the bite or bay from Ratcliffe Cross to Limehouse\r\nHole, for that the river winding about again from thence towards the new\r\ndock at Deptford runs almost due south-west, so that the wind blew down\r\none reach and up another, and the ships must of necessity drive into the\r\nbottom of the angle between both.\r\n\r\n“This was the case, and as the place is not large, and the number of ships\r\nvery great, the force of the wind had driven them so into one another, and\r\nlaid them so upon one another, as it were in heaps, that I think a man may\r\nsafely defy all the world to do the like.\r\n\r\n“The author of this collection had the curiosity the next day to view the\r\nplace, and to observe the posture they lay in, which nevertheless it is\r\nimpossible to describe; there lay, by the best account he could take, few\r\nless than seven hundred sail of ships, some very great ones, between\r\nShadwell and Limehouse inclusive; the posture is not to be imagined but by\r\nthem that saw it; some vessels lay heeling off with the bow of another\r\nship over her waist, and the stern of another upon her forecastle; the\r\nboltsprits of some drove into the cabin-windows of others; some lay with\r\ntheir sterns tossed up so high that the tide flowed into their forecastles\r\nbefore they could come to rights; some lay so leaning upon others that the\r\nundermost vessels would sink before the other could float; the numbers of\r\nmasts, boltsprits and yards split and broke, the staving the heads and\r\nsterns, and carved work, the tearing and destruction of rigging, and the\r\nsqueezing of boats to pieces between the ships, is not to be reckoned; but\r\nthere was hardly a vessel to be seen that had not suffered some damage or\r\nother in one or all of these articles.\r\n\r\n“There were several vessels sunk in this hurricane, but as they were\r\ngenerally light ships the damage was chiefly to the vessels; but there\r\nwere two ships sunk with great quantity of goods on board: the _Russell_\r\ngalley was sunk at Limehouse, being a great part laden with bale goods for\r\nthe Straits; and the _Sarah_ galley, laden for Leghorn, sunk at an anchor\r\nat Blackwall, and though she was afterwards weighed and brought on shore,\r\nyet her back was broken, or so otherwise disabled that she was never fit\r\nfor the sea. There were several men drowned in these last two vessels, but\r\nwe could never come to have the particular number.\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: THE WEST-INDIAMEN DRIVEN ASHORE AT TILBURY FORT.]\r\n\r\n“Near Gravesend several ships drove on shore below Tilbury Fort, and among\r\nthem five bound for the West Indies; but as the shore is oozy and soft,\r\nthe vessels sat upright and easy.” The loss of small craft in the river\r\nwas enormous; not less than 300 ships’ boats and 500 wherries were sunk or\r\ndashed to pieces. Barges and lighters were sunk and broke loose by the\r\nscore, and twenty-two watermen and others working on the river were\r\ndrowned.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this tempest was felt very severely on shore, not less than\r\n123 persons being killed by falling buildings, &c. It is said that not\r\nless than 800 dwellings were blown down, while barns, stacks of chimneys,\r\npinnacles, steeples, and trees, were strewed all over the country.\r\n\r\nDozens of remarkable cases might be given of wonderful preservations at\r\nsea during this storm, and one or two have been cited. A small vessel ran\r\non the rocks in Milford Haven and was fast breaking up, when an empty\r\nboat, which had got loose, drifted past so near the wreck that two men\r\njumped into it and saved their lives. A poor boy on board could not jump\r\nso far, and was drowned. A poor sailor of Brighthelmston was taken off a\r\nwreck after he had hung by his hands and feet on the top of a mast for\r\neight-and-forty hours, the sea raging so high that no boat durst approach\r\nhim. A waterman in the river Thames, lying asleep in the cabin of a barge\r\nnear Blackfriars, was driven below London Bridge, “and the barge went of\r\nherself into the Tower Dock, and lay safe on shore. The man never waked\r\nnor heard the storm till it was day; and, to his great astonishment, he\r\nfound himself safe, as above.” Two boys, lodging in the Poultry, and\r\nliving in a top garret, were, by the fall of chimneys, which broke through\r\nthe floors, carried quite to the bottom of the cellar, and received no\r\nhurt at all.\r\n\r\nIt has been shown how universal was the storm on the English coasts, and\r\nit extended to all parts of the interior.(70) In Norfolk, a small town\r\nexperienced the horrors of fire simultaneously with the gale. The\r\ninhabitants were powerless to extinguish it; and the wind blew the ruins,\r\nalmost as much as the fire, in all directions. If the people came to\r\nwindward they were in danger of being blown into the flames, and to\r\nleeward they dared not approach the fire, which would have scorched them\r\nup. Those who escaped the conflagration ran the imminent risk of being\r\nknocked on the head by bricks and tiles, which flew about as though they\r\nwere tinder. The storm, although most severe on the Friday\r\nbefore-mentioned, lasted almost continuously for a week.\r\n\r\nThe city of London was a strange spectacle at this time. “The houses\r\nlooked like skeletons,” says Defoe, “and an universal air of horror seemed\r\nto sit on the countenances of the people. All business seemed to be laid\r\naside for the time, and people were generally intent upon getting help to\r\nrepair their habitations.” The streets lay covered with tiles and slates,\r\nbricks and chimney-pots. Common tiles rose from 21s. per thousand to £6.\r\nAbove 2,000 great stacks of chimneys were blown down in and about London,\r\nbesides gable-ends and roofs by the score, and about twenty whole houses\r\nin the suburbs. In addition to those killed by the fall of various parts\r\nof buildings, above 200 were reported as wounded and maimed. And it must\r\nbe remembered that these were not the days of morning and evening and\r\nspecial editions, and copious and generally correct reports. Had\r\ntelegraphs and railways and steamships brought in the news collected by\r\ninnumerable correspondents, as they would to-day, Defoe’s book would never\r\nhave been compiled. And it may be here observed, in honour of the memory\r\nof that immortal author, that he never cites a case, or speaks of it as a\r\npositive fact, without giving his authority or authorities. He says in one\r\nplace, “Some of our printed accounts give us larger and plainer accounts\r\nof the loss of lives than I will venture to affirm for truth: as of\r\nseveral houses near Moorfields levelled with the ground; fourteen people\r\ndrowned in a wherry going to Gravesend and five in a wherry from Chelsea.\r\nNot that it is not very probable to be true, but, as I resolve not to hand\r\nanything to posterity but what comes very well attested, I omit such\r\nrelations as I have not extraordinary assurance as to the fact.” This is\r\nhardly the way with all book-makers!\r\n\r\nMost of those killed were buried or crushed by the broken fragments and\r\nrubbish of falling stacks of chimneys or walls. The fall of brick walls\r\nmade a serious item in the losses. At Greenwich Park several pieces of the\r\nwall were down for a hundred rods at a place; the palace of St. James’s\r\nwas greatly damaged; the roof of the guard-house at Whitehall blown off,\r\nseriously hurting nine soldiers; the lead stripped off and rolled up like\r\nparchment from scores of churches and public buildings, including\r\nWestminster Abbey and Christ Church Hospital. “It was very remarkable,”\r\nDefoe notes, “that the bridge over the Thames [_i.e._, Old London Bridge]\r\nreceived so little damage, the buildings standing high and not sheltered\r\nby other erections, as they would be in the streets. Above a hundred elms,\r\nsome of them said to have been planted by Wolsey, were blown down in St.\r\nJames’s Park. Very fortunately the storm was succeeded by fine weather:\r\nfor had rain or snow followed, the misery and damage to hundreds and\r\nhundreds of tenants would have been fearfully increased.”\r\n\r\nAt Stowmarket, in Suffolk, one of the largest spires—100 feet high above\r\nthe steeple—was completely carried away, with all its heavy timbers and an\r\nimmense quantity of lead. So in Brenchly and Great Peckham, Kent, the\r\nformer doing damage to the church and porch as it fell, and entailing a\r\ntotal loss of £800 to £1,000, which would represent much more in these\r\ndays. “The cathedral church of Ely,” said one of Defoe’s correspondents,\r\n“by the providence of God, did, contrary to all men’s expectations, stand\r\nout the shock, but suffered very much in every part of it, especially that\r\nwhich is called the body of it, the lead being torn and rent up a\r\nconsiderable way together; about 40 lights of glass blown down and\r\nshattered to pieces; one ornamental pinnacle, belonging to the north\r\naisle, demolished; and the lead in divers other parts of it blown up into\r\ngreat heaps. Five chimneys falling down in a place called the Colledge,\r\nthe place where the prebendaries’ lodgings are, did no other damage\r\n(prais’d be God!) than beat down some part of the houses along with them.\r\nThe loss which the church and college of Ely sustained being, by\r\ncomputation, near £2,000.” Accounts of nearly irretrievable damage done to\r\nvaluable painted church windows, for one of which—at Fairford,\r\nGloucester—£1,500 had been offered, came from many points. In some cases\r\nthe lead blown from roofs, amounting to tons in weight, was so tightly\r\nrolled up that it took a number of men to unroll it without cutting or\r\nother damage.\r\n\r\nThe Bishop of Bath and Wells was killed under rather remarkable\r\ncircumstances. The palace was the relic of a very old castle, only one\r\ncorner of it being modernised for his lordship’s use. Had the bishop slept\r\nin the new portion his life would have been spared; but he remained in one\r\nof the older apartments. Two chimney-stacks fell and crushed in the roof,\r\ndriving it upon the bishop’s bed, forcing it quite through the next floor\r\ninto the hall, and burying both himself and lady in the rubbish. The\r\nformer appears to have risen, perhaps perceiving the approaching danger,\r\nand was found, with his brains dashed out, near a doorway.\r\n\r\nOne of the most remarkable cases of the power of the wind ashore was the\r\nremoval of a stone of four hundredweight, which lay sheltered under a\r\nbank, to a distance of seven yards. On the Kingscote estate, in\r\nGloucester, 600 trees, all about eighty feet in height, were thrown down\r\nwithin a compass of five acres. The storm was accompanied by thunder and\r\nlightning and waterspouts. A clergyman, writing from Besselsleigh,\r\nsays:—“On Friday, the 26th of November, in the afternoon, about four of\r\nthe clock, a country fellow came running to me, in a great fright, and\r\nvery earnestly entreated me to go and see a pillar, as he called it, in\r\nthe air in a field hard by. I went with the fellow, and when I came found\r\nit to be a spout marching directly with the wind; and I can think of\r\nnothing I can compare it to better than the trunk of an elephant, which it\r\nresembled—only much bigger. It was extended to a great length, and swept\r\nthe ground as it went, leaving a mark behind. It crossed a field, and,\r\nwhich was very strange (and which I should scarce have been induced to\r\nbelieve had I not myself seen it, besides several countrymen, who were\r\nastonished at it, meeting with an oak that stood towards the middle of the\r\nfield, snapped the body of it asunder. Afterwards, crossing a road, it\r\nsucked up the water that was in the cart-ruts. Then, coming to an old\r\nbarn, it tumbled it down, and the thatch that was on the top was carried\r\nabout by the wind, which was then very high and in great confusion. After\r\nthis I followed it no farther, and therefore saw no more of it, but a\r\nparishioner of mine, going from hence to Hincksey, in a field about a\r\nquarter of a mile off of this place, was on the sudden knocked down and\r\nlay upon the place till some people came by and brought him home; and he\r\nis not yet quite recovered.” An earthquake is also said to have followed\r\nthe great storm.\r\n\r\nEnough has now been written to show how universal were the effects of this\r\nterrible gale. The details, as recorded by Defoe and others, would fill\r\nseveral chapters like the present. The author of “Robinson Crusoe” puts,\r\nas we have seen, the loss of life partly on land but principally by sea,\r\nat 8,000, but a French authority places it at the enormous number of\r\n30,000! It can well be believed that a large proportion of the casualties\r\nwere never reported or recorded.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: A LIFE-BOAT GOING OUT.]\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: GREATHEAD’S LIFE-BOAT.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\n\r\n                           “MAN THE LIFE-BOAT!”\r\n\r\n\r\n      The Englishman’s direct interest in the Sea—The History of the\r\n       Life-boat and its Work—Its Origin—A Coach-builder the First\r\n      Inventor—Lionel Lukin’s Boat—Royal Encouragement—Wreck of the\r\n     _Adventure_—The Poor Crew Drowned in Sight of Thousands—Good out\r\n    of Evil—The South Shields Committee and their Prize Boat—Wouldhave\r\n    and Greathead—The latter Rewarded by Government, &c.—Slow Progress\r\n     of the Life-boat Movement—The Old Boat at Redcar—Organisation of\r\n      the National Life-boat Institution—Sir William Hillary’s Brave\r\n          Deeds—Terrible Losses at the Isle of Man—Loss of Three\r\n    Life-boats—Reorganisation of the Society—Immense Competition for a\r\n           Prize—Beeching’s “Self-righting” Boats—Buoyancy and\r\n             Ballast—Dangers of the Service—A Year’s Wrecks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of the life-boat is one that concerns every Englishman. In\r\nthis isle of the sea, our own beloved Britain, our sympathies are\r\nconstantly excited on behalf of those who suffer from shipwreck. It would\r\nnot be too much to say that one-half the population of the United Kingdom\r\nhave some direct interest in this matter. Let us not be misunderstood.\r\nPecuniary interests in shipping are held here more largely than in any\r\nother country, but we are not all shipowners or merchants. But how many of\r\nus have some brother or friend a seafarer! Of the writer’s own direct\r\nrelatives six have travelled and voyaged to very far distant lands, and\r\nthe friends of whom the same might be said would aggregate several score.\r\nThis is no uncommon case.\r\n\r\nThe origin of the life-boat, as now understood, is of very modern date.\r\nThose who would study the matter in its entirety cannot do better than\r\nconsult the work(71) from which the larger part of the material\r\nincorporated in the present chapter is derived. One of the very earliest\r\ninventors of a life-boat was Mr. Lionel Lukin, a coach-builder of Long\r\nAcre, who turned his attention to the subject in 1784, from purely\r\nbenevolent motives. The then Prince of Wales (afterwards George IV.), who\r\nknew Lukin personally, not only encouraged him to test his inventions, but\r\noffered to pay the expenses. Lukin purchased a Norway yawl, to the outer\r\nframe of which he added a projecting gunwale of cork, tapering from nine\r\ninches amidships to very little at the bows and stern. Hollow water-tight\r\nenclosures gave it great buoyancy, while ballast sufficient for stability\r\nwas afforded by a heavy false keel of iron. On this principle several\r\nboats were constructed, and found to be, as the inventor describes them,\r\n“unimmergible.” The Rev. Dr. Shairp, of Bamborough, hearing of the\r\ninvention, and having charge of a charity for saving life at sea, sent a\r\nboat to Lukin to be made “unimmergible.” This was done, and satisfactory\r\naccounts were afterwards received of the altered boat, which was reported\r\nto have saved several lives in the first year of its use. The Admiralty\r\nand Trinity House would have nothing to do with it, in spite of the Prince\r\nof Wales’ interest in the matter. It has been said that a committee is a\r\nbody without a conscience; it was true in those good old days. Lukin\r\nretired from business in 1824, and went to live at Hythe in Kent, where,\r\nten years after, he died; the inscription on his tomb in Hythe churchyard\r\nsays that he was the first to build a life-boat.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding Lukin’s increasing efforts to bring his life-boats into\r\ngeneral use, hardly any progress had been made in their general adoption\r\ntill 1789, when the _Adventure_, of Newcastle, was wrecked at the mouth of\r\nthe Tyne. While this vessel lay stranded on a dangerous sand at the\r\nentrance of the river, in the midst of tremendous breakers, her crew\r\n“dropped off one by one from the rigging,” only three hundred yards from\r\nthe shore, and in the presence of thousands of spectators. This horrible\r\ndisaster led to good results, for a committee was immediately appointed at\r\na meeting of the inhabitants of South Shields, and premiums offered for\r\nthe best model of a life-boat “calculated to brave the dangers of the sea,\r\nparticularly of broken water.” From many plans submitted two were\r\nselected, those of Mr. William Wouldhave and Mr. Henry Greathead. The idea\r\nof the first is said to have been suggested by the following circumstance.\r\nWouldhave had been asked to assist a woman in putting a “skeel” of water\r\non her head, when he noticed that she had a piece of a broken wooden dish\r\nlying in the water, which floated with the points upwards, and turning it\r\nover several times, he found that it always righted itself. Greathead’s\r\nmodel had a curved instead of a straight keel, and he, as the only\r\npractical boatbuilder who had competed, was awarded the premium, some of\r\nWouldhave’s ideas in regard to the use of cork being incorporated. This\r\nfirst boat, thirty feet in length, had a cork lining twelve inches thick,\r\nreaching from the deck to the thwarts, and a cork fender outside sixteen\r\ninches deep, four inches wide, and twenty-one feet long, nearly 7 cwts. of\r\ncork being fitted to the boat altogether. Greathead’s curved keel was,\r\nhowever, the main point, and he is regarded as the inventor of the first\r\npracticable life-boat. From 1791 to 1797 his first boat was the means of\r\nsaving the whole or larger part of the crews of five ships.\r\nNotwithstanding all this, no other life-boat was built till 1798, when the\r\nthen Duke of Northumberland ordered one to be built at his own expense,\r\nwhich in two years saved the crews of three vessels. Others were soon\r\nafter constructed, and before the end of 1803 Greathead built no less than\r\nthirty-one, eight of which were for foreign countries. In the beginning of\r\n1802, when two hundred lives had been saved at the entrance of the Tyne\r\nalone, Greathead applied to Parliament for a national reward. Possibly it\r\nis more remarkable that he obtained it. £1,200 was voted to him, to which\r\nthe Trinity House, Lloyd’s, and the Society of Arts added substantial\r\npresents. The Emperor of Russia sent a diamond ring to the inventor.\r\n\r\nAfter this, one might have reasonably thought that life-boats had become a\r\nrecognised institution and a national necessity. Not so. For years\r\nafterwards there was hardly an advance made, and there was no organised\r\nsociety to work them. The Government was apathetic. In 1810, one of\r\nGreathead’s life-boats, carried overland to Hartley on the coast of\r\nNorthumberland, rescued the crews of several fishing-boats. On returning\r\ntoward the shore, the boat got too near a fatal rock-reef, and was split\r\nin halves; thirty-four poor fellows—a moment before the savers and the\r\nsaved—were drowned. The authority before cited says that even now several\r\nof Greathead’s boats—exclusively rowing boats—are to be found on the\r\ncoast; the oldest one is that in the possession of the boatmen at Redcar,\r\nit having been built in 1802. On seeing this fine old life-boat, which had\r\nsaved some scores of lives, Viscount Stratford de Redcliffe composed some\r\nyears ago the following verses, which were set to music:—\r\n\r\n  “The Life-boat! Oh, the Life-boat!\r\n    We all have known so long,\r\n  A refuge for the feeble,\r\n    The glory of the strong.\r\n  Twice thirty years have vanished,\r\n    Since first upon the wave\r\n  She housed the drowning mariner,\r\n    And snatched him from the grave.\r\n      *     *     *     *\r\n  The voices of the rescued,\r\n    Their numbers may be read,\r\n  The tears of speechless feeling\r\n    Our wives and children shed;\r\n  The memories of mercy\r\n    In man’s extremest need,\r\n  All for the dear old Life-boat\r\n    Uniting seem to plead.”\r\n\r\nAs already stated, the important movement for saving life from shipwreck\r\nlanguished for some time. To Sir William Hillary and Thomas Wilson, then\r\none of the Members of Parliament for London, is due the organisation of\r\nthat most excellent society which has done more in the cause of humanity\r\nthan, perhaps, any other whatever, and has done it on means which even\r\nto-day are too limited. Sir William Hillary was not a talker or subscriber\r\nmerely, but had been personally active in saving life. When a Government\r\ncutter, the _Vigilant_, was wrecked in Douglas Bay, Isle of Man, where he\r\nwas then residing, he was one of the foremost in rescuing a part of the\r\ncrew. Listen to our authority: “Between the years 1821 and 1846, no fewer\r\nthan 144 wrecks had taken place on the island, and 172 lives were lost;\r\nwhile the destruction of property was estimated at a quarter of a million.\r\nIn 1825, when the _City of Glasgow_ steamer was stranded in Douglas Bay,\r\nSir William Hillary assisted in saving the lives of sixty-two persons; and\r\nin the same year eleven men from the brig Leopard, and nine from the sloop\r\n_Fancy_, which became a total wreck. In 1827-32, Sir William, accompanied\r\nby his son, saved many other lives; but his greatest success was on the\r\n20th of November, 1830, when he saved in the life-boat twenty-two men, the\r\nwhole of the crew of the mail steamer _St. George_, which became a total\r\nwreck on St. Mary’s Rock. On this occasion he was washed overboard among\r\nthe wreck, with other three persons, and was saved with great difficulty,\r\nhaving had six of his ribs fractured.” No wonder that a genuine hero of\r\nthis character should have succeeded in obtaining the assistance and\r\nencouragement of His Majesty King George IV., and any number of royal\r\nhighnesses, archbishops, bishops, noblemen, and other distinguished\r\npeople,(72) when the formation of a “Royal National Institution for the\r\nPreservation of Life from Shipwreck” was mooted. The Society was\r\nimmediately organised, and the receipts for the first year of its\r\nexistence were £9,800 odd. The Committee, in their first report, were able\r\nto state that they had built and stationed twelve life-boats, while,\r\ndoubtless, from their good example, thirty-nine life-boats had been\r\nstationed on our shores by benevolent individuals and associations not\r\nconnected with the Institution. In its early days, the Society assisted\r\nlocal bodies to place life-boats on the coast, such being independent of\r\nits control. The good work done by the Association in its early days is\r\nindicated in the following statement. In the second annual report the\r\nCommittee showed that up to that period the Society had contributed to the\r\nsaving of 342 lives from shipwreck, either by its own life-saving\r\napparatus or by other means, for which it had granted rewards. And its\r\ntotal revenue for the second year was only £3,392 7s. 5d.!(73) For fifteen\r\nyears afterwards the annual receipts were still smaller.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: LIFE-BOAT SAVING THE CREW OF THE “ST. GEORGE.”]\r\n\r\nBetween 1841 and 1850 the Institution lost three life-boats, and this was\r\nthe smallest part of the loss. In October, 1841, one of the boats at\r\nBlyth, Northumberland, while being pulled against a strong wind, was\r\nstruck by a heavy sea, causing her to run stern under, and to half fill\r\nwith water. A second sea struck her, and she capsized. Ten men were\r\ndrowned. The second case occurred at Robin Hood’s Bay, on the coast of\r\nYorkshire, in February, 1843. The life-boat went off to the assistance of\r\na stranded vessel, the _Ann_, of London, during a fresh northerly gale.\r\nThe life-boat had got alongside the wreck, and was taking the crew off,\r\nwhen, as far as can be understood, several men jumped into her at the\r\nmoment when a great wave struck her, and she capsized. Many of the crew\r\ngot on her bottom, while three remained underneath her, and in this state\r\nshe drifted towards the shore on the opposite side of the bay. On seeing\r\nthe accident from the shore, five gallant fellows launched a boat and\r\ntried to pull off to the rescue, but had hardly encountered two seas, when\r\nshe was turned _end over end_, two of her crew being drowned. An officer\r\nof the Coastguard service and eleven men lost their lives on this\r\noccasion; a few were saved, coming to shore safely on the bottom of the\r\nlife-boat, and even under it, in its reversed condition.\r\n\r\n    [Illustration: LOSS OF A LIFE-BOAT AT THE SHIPWRECK OF THE “ANN.”]\r\n\r\nA still worse accident occurred, in December, 1849, to the South Shields\r\nlife-boat, which had gone out with twenty-four experienced pilots to the\r\naid of the _Betsy_ of Littlehampton, stranded on the Herd Sand. She had\r\nreached the wreck, and was lying alongside, though badly secured. The\r\nshipwrecked men were about to descend into the boat, when a heavy sea,\r\nrecoiling from the bows of the vessel, lifted her on end, and a second sea\r\ncompleted the work of destruction by throwing her completely over. She\r\nultimately drifted ashore. Twenty out of twenty-four on board were\r\ndrowned. On seeing the accident, two other life-boats immediately dashed\r\noff, and saved four of the pilots and the crew of the _Betsy_.\r\n\r\nThe year 1850 marked an epoch in the history of life-boats, for then the\r\nInstitution was thoroughly re-organised. It was arranged that the boats\r\nshould be periodically inspected by qualified officers, and that a fixed\r\nscale of payment, both for actual service or quarterly exercise, should be\r\nmade to the coxswains and crews.(74) His Grace the late Duke of\r\nNorthumberland offered a prize of one hundred guineas for the best model\r\nof a life-boat, and a like sum towards constructing a boat on that model.\r\nNo less than 280 plans and models were sent in, not merely from all parts\r\nof the United Kingdom, but from France, Holland, Germany, and the United\r\nStates. After some six months’ detailed examination on the part of the\r\ncommittee, Mr. James Beeching, of Great Yarmouth, was awarded the prize.\r\nThat gentleman constructed several boats shortly afterwards, embodying\r\nmost or all of the leading improvements, and was the first to build a\r\n“self-righting” life-boat. All of the Institution’s modern boats are on\r\nthis principle.\r\n\r\n“The chief peculiarity of a life-boat,” says our authority, “which\r\ndistinguishes it from all ordinary boats, is its being rendered\r\nunsubmergible, by attaching to it, chiefly within boards, water-tight\r\nair-cases, or fixed water-tight compartments under a deck.... Especially\r\nit is essential that the spare space along the sides of a life-boat,\r\nwithin boards, should be entirely occupied by buoyant cases or\r\ncompartments; as when such is the case, on her shipping a sea, the water,\r\nuntil got rid off, is confined to the midships part of the boat, where, to\r\na great extent, it serves as ballast, instead of falling over to the\r\nlee-side, and destroying her equilibrium, as is the case in an ordinary\r\nopen boat.” The Institution’s self-righting boats are ballasted with\r\n_heavy_ iron keels (up to 21 cwts.), and _light_ air-tight cases, cork,\r\n&c. The advantage of employing a ballast of less specific gravity than\r\nwater is, that in the event of the boat being stove in, the buoyancy of\r\nthe material itself then comes into play.\r\n\r\n“Self-righting” is, of course, a most important principle in life-boats,\r\nand out of some 250 boats of the Institution there are scarcely more than\r\ntwenty which do not possess it. Up to twenty years or so ago it was\r\nderided by many otherwise practical men. Yet as early as 1792 we find the\r\nRev. James Bremner, of Walls, Orkney, proposing to make all ordinary boats\r\ncapable of righting themselves in the water by placing two water-tight\r\ncasks, parallel to each other, in the head and stern sheets, and by\r\naffixing a heavy iron keel. The self-righting power of to-day is obtained\r\nby the following means. The boat is built with considerably higher\r\ngunwales at the bows and stern than in the centre, while four to six feet\r\nof the space at either end are water-tight air-chambers. A heavy iron keel\r\nis attached, and a nearly equal weight of light air-cases, and cork\r\nballast cases are stowed betwixt the boat’s floor and the deck. “No other\r\nmeasures are necessary to be taken in order to effect the self-righting\r\npower. When the boat is forcibly placed in the water with her keel\r\nupwards, she is floated unsteadily on the two air chambers at bow and\r\nstern, while the heavy iron keel and other ballast then being carried\r\nabove the centre of gravity, an unstable equilibrium is at once effected,\r\nin which dilemma the boat cannot remain, the raised weight falls on one\r\nside or the other of the centre of gravity, and drags the boat round to\r\nher ordinary position, when the water shipped during the evolution quickly\r\nescapes through the relieving tubes, and she is again ready for any\r\nservice that may be required of her.”\r\n\r\nNearly all life-boat stations are provided with a transporting carriage,\r\nbuilt especially for the particular boat. The use of this, in many cases,\r\nis to convey the boat by land to the point nearest the wreck. On some\r\ncoasts the distance may be several miles. In addition to this, a\r\nboat-carriage is of immense service in launching a boat from a beach\r\nwithout her keel touching the ground; so much so, indeed, that one can be\r\nreadily launched from a carriage through a high surf, when without one she\r\ncould not be got off the beach. The carriage is often backed sufficiently\r\nfar into the water to enable the boat to float when she is run off.\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: A life-boat and carriage—latest form.]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing will give a sufficient idea of the boat itself, and now to\r\nits work. Courage and ability are required to put it into action, and the\r\ndangers to which the crew of a life-boat are exposed entitle those who\r\nencounter them to the greatest honour. “It is impossible to exaggerate the\r\nawful circumstances attending a shipwreck. Let us picture the time, when,\r\nafter a peaceful sunset and the toils of the day are over, the hero of the\r\nlife-boat has retired to rest, and the silence of the night is unbroken\r\nexcept by the murmur of the winds and the noise of the sea breaking on the\r\nshore. With the approach of the storm, however, the winds and waves rise\r\nin fury upon the deep, and with their mingled vengeance lash the cliffs\r\nand the beach. A signal of distress arouses the coxswain and his men;\r\ncrowds rush in curiosity to the cliffs, or line the shore, heedless of the\r\ndriving rain or the blinding sleet. Barrels of tar are lighted on the\r\ncoast, and the signal gun and the fiery rocket make a fresh appeal to the\r\nbrave. The boat-house is unlocked, and the life-boat with her crew is\r\ndragged hurriedly to the shore. The storm rages wildly, and the mountains\r\nof surf and sea appal the stoutest heart. The gallant men look dubiously\r\nat the work before them, and fathers and mothers and wives and children\r\nimplore them to desist from a hopeless enterprise. The voice of the\r\ncoxswain, however, prevails. The life-boat is launched among the breakers,\r\ncutting bravely through the foaming mass—now buried under the swelling\r\nbillows, or rising on their summit—now dashed against the hapless wreck\r\nstill instinct with life—now driven from it by a mountain wave—now\r\nembarking its living freight, and carrying them, through storm and danger\r\nand darkness, to a blessed shore. Would that this was the invariable issue\r\nof a life-boat service! The boat that adventures to a wreck meets with\r\ndisaster itself occasionally; and in the war of the elements some of its\r\ngallant crew have sometimes been the first of its victims.” And when we\r\nconsider that the number of wrecks on the coasts of the United Kingdom\r\nalone, averaged 1,446 per annum for the twenty years between 1852 and\r\n1871, we can form an idea of the importance of life-boat work on these\r\nshores. In the succeeding chapter some special instances of perilous and\r\nsuccessful rescues will be presented.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   “MAN THE LIFE-BOAT!” (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n    A “Dirty” Night on the Sands—Wreck of the _Samaritano_—The Vessel\r\n       boarded by Margate and Whitstable Men—A Gale in its Fury—The\r\n     Vessel breaking up—Nineteen Men in the Fore-rigging—Two Margate\r\n    Life-boats Wrecked—Fate of a Lugger—The Scene at Ramsgate—“Man the\r\n       Life-boat!”—The good Steamer _Aid_—The Life-boat Towed out—A\r\n       Terrible Trip—A Grand Struggle with the Elements—The Flag of\r\n       Distress made out—How to reach it—The Life-boat cast off—On\r\n      through the Breakers—The Wreck reached at last—Difficulties of\r\n    Rescuing the Men—The poor little Cabin Boy—The Life-boat Crowded—A\r\n        Moment of great Peril—The Steamer reached at last—Back to\r\n    Ramsgate—The Reward of Merit—Loss of a Passenger Steamer—The Three\r\n      Lost Corpses—The Emigrant Ship on the Sands—A Splendid Night’s\r\n                                  Work.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe waves are tearing over the fatal Goodwin Sands, but the life-boats of\r\nRamsgate, Margate, Deal, and Kingsdown are ready for their work. At\r\nRamsgate, in particular, the life-boat is ready at her moorings in the\r\nharbour, while a powerful steam-tug—the _Aid_, whose interesting history\r\nwould form many a chapter—is lying with steam partially up, prepared to\r\ntow out the boat as near the Goodwin Sands as may be with safety. The\r\n“storm warriors,” as the Rev. Mr. Gilmore calls them with so much\r\nappropriateness, in his fascinating and powerfully-written work,(75) “are\r\non the watch, hour after hour, through the stormy night walking the pier,\r\nand giving keen glances to where the Goodwin Sands are white with the\r\nchurning, seething waves that leap high, and plunge and foam amid the\r\ntreacherous shoals and banks. Look! a flash is seen; listen, in a few\r\nseconds, yes, there is the throb and boom of a distant gun, a rocket\r\ncleaves the darkness; and now the cry—‘Man the life-boat! Man the\r\nlife-boat! Seaward ho! Seaward ho!’ Storm warriors to the rescue!”\r\n\r\nOne Sunday night in the month of February, a few years ago, the weather\r\nwas what sailors call “dirty,” and accompanied by sudden gusts of wind and\r\nsnow-squalls. Before the light broke on Monday morning, the Margate\r\nlugger, _Eclipse_, put out to sea to cruise round the shoals and sands in\r\nthe neighbourhood of Margate, on the look-out for the victims of any\r\ndisasters that might have occurred during the night, and the crew soon\r\ndiscovered that a vessel was ashore on the Margate sands. She proved to be\r\nthe Spanish brig _Samaritano_, bound from Antwerp to Santander, and laden\r\nwith a valuable cargo; she had a crew of eleven men under the command of\r\nthe captain, Modesto Crispo. Hoping to save the vessel, the lugger, as she\r\nwas running for the brig, spoke a Whitstable fishing-smack, and borrowed\r\ntwo of her men and her boat. They boarded the brig as the tide went down,\r\nand hoped to be able to get her off the sands at the next high water. For\r\nthis purpose, six Margate boatmen and the two Whitstable men were left on\r\nboard.\r\n\r\nWith the rising tide the gale came on again with renewed fury, and it soon\r\nbecame a question not of saving the vessel, but of saving their own lives.\r\nThe sea dashed furiously over the wreck, lifting her, and then letting her\r\nfall with terrific violence on the sands. Her timbers quivered and shook,\r\nand a hole was quickly knocked in her side. She filled with water, and\r\nsettled on one side. “The waves began now to break with great force over\r\nthe deck; the lugger’s boat was speedily knocked to pieces and swept\r\noverboard; the hatches were forced up; and some of the cargo which floated\r\non the deck was at once washed away. The brig began to roll and labour\r\nfearfully, as wave after wave broke against her, with a force that shook\r\nher from stem to stern, and threatened to throw her bodily upon her\r\nbroadside; the men, fearing this, cut the weather rigging of the mainmast,\r\nand the mast soon broke off short with a great crash, and went over the\r\nside.” All hands now had to take to the fore-rigging; nineteen souls with\r\nnothing between them and death but the few shrouds of a shaking mast! The\r\nwaves threw up columns of foam, and the spray froze upon them as it fell.\r\nThe Margate and Whitstable men were caught in a trap, for neither lugger\r\nnor smack would have lived five minutes in the sea that surrounded the\r\nvessel. Would the life-boat come?\r\n\r\nAs soon as the news of the wreck reached Margate, the smaller of the two\r\nlife-boats was manned and launched. By an oversight in the hurry of\r\npreparation, the valves of the air-tight boxes had been left open, and she\r\nwas fast filling. Although she succeeded in getting within a quarter of a\r\nmile of the brig, she had to be speedily turned towards shore, or she\r\nwould have been wrecked herself. After battling for four hours with the\r\nsea and gale, she was run ashore in Westgate Bay. There the coastguardmen\r\ndid their best for them. Meantime, when it was learned in Margate that the\r\nfirst boat was disabled, the larger one was launched. Away they started,\r\nthe brave crew doing all they could to battle with the gale, but all in\r\nvain; their tiller gave way, and they had to give up the attempt. They\r\nwere driven ashore about one mile from the town. Next, two luggers\r\nattempted to get out to the wreck. The fate of the first was soon settled:\r\na fearful squall of wind struck her before she had got many hundred yards\r\nclear of the pier, and swept her foremast clean out of her. The second\r\nlugger was a little more fortunate; she beat out to the Sands, but only to\r\nfind the surf so heavy, that it was impossible to cross them, or to get\r\nnear the wreck. “The Margate people became full of despair; and many a\r\nbitter tear was shed for sympathy and for personal loss as they watched\r\nthe wreck, and thought of the poor fellows perishing slowly before their\r\neyes, apparently without any possibility of being saved.” And now let us\r\nchange the scene to Ramsgate.\r\n\r\nAbout nine o’clock the news came to Ramsgate that there was a brig ashore\r\non the Woolpack Sands, off Margate, but it was naturally concluded that\r\nthe life-boats of the latter place would go to the rescue, and no one\r\nsupposed that the services of the Ramsgate boat would be required. “But\r\nshortly after twelve, a coastguard-man from Margate hastened breathless to\r\nthe pier and to the harbour-master’s office, saying, in answer to eager\r\ninquiries, as he hurried on, that the two Margate life-boats had been\r\nwrecked. The order was, of course, at once given, ‘Man the life-boat!’ and\r\nthe boatmen rushed for it. First come, first in; not a moment’s\r\nhesitation, not a thought of further clothing: they will go in as they\r\nare, rather than not go at all. The news rapidly spreads; each boatman as\r\nhe heard it, hastily snatched up his bag of waterproof overalls and\r\nsouth-wester cap, and rushed down to the boat; and for some time, boatman\r\nafter boatman was to be seen racing down the pier, hoping to find a place\r\nstill vacant; if the race had been to save their lives, rather than to\r\nrisk them, it would hardly have been more hotly contested.\r\n\r\n“Some of those who had won the race and were in the boat were ill-prepared\r\nwith clothing for the hardships they would have to endure, for if they had\r\nnot their waterproofs at hand, they did not delay to get them, fearing\r\nthat the crew might be made up before they got to the boat. But these men\r\nwere supplied by the generosity of their disappointed friends, who had\r\ncome down better prepared, but too late for the enterprise; the famous\r\ncork jackets were thrown into the boat and at once put on by the men.\r\n\r\n“The powerful steam-tug, well-named the _Aid_, that belongs to the\r\nharbour, and has her steam up night and day ready for any emergency that\r\nmay arise, speedily got her steam to full power, and with her brave and\r\nskilful master, Daniel Reading, in command, took the boat in tow, and\r\ntogether they made their way out of the harbour. James Hogben, who with\r\nReading has been in many a wild scene of danger, was coxswain, and steered\r\nand commanded the life-boat.\r\n\r\n“It was nearly low water at the time, but the force of the gale was such\r\nas to send a good deal of spray dashing over the pier; the snow fell in\r\nblinding squalls, and drifted and eddied in every protected nook and\r\ncorner. It was hard work for the excited crowd of people who had assembled\r\nto see the life-boat start, to battle their way through the drifts and\r\nagainst the wind, snow, and foam, to the head of the pier; but there at\r\nlast they gathered, and many a one felt his heart fail as the steamer and\r\nboat cleared the protection of the pier, and encountered the first rush of\r\nthe wind and sea outside. ‘She seemed to go out under water,’ said one old\r\nfellow; ‘I would not have gone out in her for the universe.’ And those who\r\ndid not know the heroism and determination that such scenes call forth in\r\nthe breasts of the boatmen, could not help wondering much at the eagerness\r\nwhich had been displayed to get a place in the boat—and this although the\r\nhardy fellows knew that the two Margate life-boats had been wrecked in the\r\nattempt to get the short distance which separated the wreck from Margate,\r\nwhile they would have to battle their way through the gale for ten or\r\ntwelve miles before they could get even in sight of the vessel.” And so\r\nthe steamer with its engines working full power plunged heavily along, the\r\nlife-boat towed astern with fifty fathoms (300 feet) of five-inch hawser\r\nout, an enormously strong rope about the thickness of a man’s wrist. The\r\nwater flowed into and over the boat, and still, like any other good\r\nlife-boat, she floated, and rose in its buoyancy, almost defying the great\r\nwaves, while her crew were knee-deep in water.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: RAMSGATE—THE “AID” GOING OUT.]\r\n\r\nThey, making their way through the Cud channel, had passed between the\r\nblack and white buoys, so well-known to Ramsgate visitors, when a fearful\r\nsea came heading towards them. It met and broke over the steamer, buried\r\nher in foam and then passed on. The life-boat rose to it, and for a moment\r\nhung with her bows high in air, then plunged bodily almost under water.\r\nThe men were nearly washed out of her, for at that moment the tow rope\r\nbroke, and the boat fell across the sea, which swept in rapid succession\r\nover her. “Oars out! oars out!” was the cry, but they could do nothing\r\nwith them. The steamer was, however, cleverly brought within a few yards\r\nto windward of the boat, and a hauling line, to which was attached a new\r\nhawser, was successfully passed to the boat, and they again proceeded in\r\nthe teeth of the blinding snow and sleet and spray which swept over the\r\nboat, till the men looked, as one said at the time, “like a body of ice.”\r\n\r\nStill they struggled on, till they reached the North Foreland, where the\r\nsea was running mountains high, and although early in the afternoon, the\r\nair was so darkened by the storm that the captain of the boat could not\r\nsee the steamer only a hundred yards ahead, and still less able were the\r\nmen on board the steamer to see the life-boat. Now they sighted Margate,\r\nand could plainly see the two disabled life-boats ashore. But where was\r\nthe wreck? A providential break in the drift of snow suddenly gave them a\r\nglimpse of it, and the master of the steamer made out the flag of distress\r\nflying in the rigging of the fated vessel. But she was on the other side\r\nof the sand, and to tow the boat round would take a long time in the face\r\nof such a gale; while for the boat to make across the sand seemed almost\r\nimpossible. But although it seemed a forlorn hope, it was resolved to\r\nforce her through the surf and sea under sail, and the hawser was cast\r\noff. Now a new complication arose. The tide was found to be running so\r\nfuriously that they must be towed at least three miles to the eastward\r\nbefore they would be sufficiently far to windward to make certain of\r\nfetching the wreck. The tow rope had to be got on board again, and it was\r\na bitter disappointment to all, that an hour or more of their precious\r\ntime must be consumed before they could possibly get to the rescue of\r\ntheir endangered brother seamen. The snow-squalls increased, and they lost\r\nsight of the wreck again and again. “The gale, which had been increasing\r\nsince the morning, came on heavier than ever, and roared like thunder\r\noverhead, the sea was running so furiously and meeting the life-boat with\r\nsuch tremendous force that the men had to cling on their hardest not to be\r\nwashed out of her, and at last the new tow rope could no longer resist the\r\nincreasing strain, and suddenly parted with a tremendous jerk; there was\r\nno thought of picking up the cable again—they could stand no further\r\ndelay, and one and all of her crew rejoiced to hear the captain of the\r\nlife-boat give orders to set sail.”\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: “CURLY” WEATHER.]\r\n\r\nStraight for the breakers they made in the increasing gloom; no faltering\r\nor hesitation, brows knit, teeth clenched, hands ready, and hearts firm.\r\nThe boat, carrying the smallest amount of sail possible, was driven on by\r\nthe hurricane force of the wind, till she plunged through the outer range\r\nof the breakers into the battling, seething, boiling sea, that marked the\r\ntreacherous shallows. “When they saw some huge breaker heading towards\r\nthem like an advancing wall, then the men threw themselves breast down on\r\nthe thwart, curled their legs under it, clasped it with all their force\r\nwith both arms, held their breath hard, and clung on for very life against\r\nthe tear and wrestle of the waves, while the rush of water poured over\r\ntheir backs and heads, and buried them in its flood. Down, down, beneath\r\nthe weight of the water, the men and boat sank; but only for a moment; the\r\nsplendid boat rose in her buoyancy, and freed herself of the seas, which\r\nfor a moment had overcome her and buried her, and her crew breathed again;\r\nand a struggling cry of triumph rises from them, ‘Well done, old boat!\r\nwell done.’”\r\n\r\nA sudden break in the storm, and the wreck is revealed to them half a mile\r\nto leeward. Her appearance made even these hardy men shudder. She had\r\nsettled down by the stern, her uplifted bow being the only part of the\r\nhull that was to be seen, and the sea was making a clean breach over her.\r\n“The mainmast was gone, her foresail and foretopsail were blown adrift,\r\nand great columns of foam were mounting up, flying over her foremast and\r\nbow. They saw a Margate lugger lying at anchor just clear of the Sands,\r\nand made close to her. As they shot by they could just make out, amid the\r\nroar of the storm, a loud hail, ‘Eight of our men on board!’ and on they\r\nflew, and in a few minutes were in a sea that would instantly have swamped\r\nthe lugger, noble and powerful boat though she was.\r\n\r\n“Approaching the wreck, it was with terrible anxiety they strained their\r\nsight, trying to discover if there were still any men left in the tangled\r\nmass of rigging, over which the sea was breaking so furiously. By degrees\r\nthey made them out. ‘I see a man’s head. Look! one is waving his arm.’—‘I\r\nmake out two! three! why, the rigging is full of the poor fellows;’ and\r\nwith a cheer of triumph, as being yet in time, the life-boat crew settled\r\nto their work.” Four hours they had been battling the elements, while the\r\nshipwrecked crew had waited eight hours despairingly, within a few miles\r\nof shore, shivering in the rigging. The sails were lowered, and anchor\r\ncast overboard. “No cheering! no shouting in the boat now, no whisper\r\nbeyond the necessary orders; the risk and suspense are too terrible! Yard\r\nby yard the cable is cautiously paid out, and the great rolling seas are\r\nallowed to carry the boat, little by little, nearer to the vessel. The\r\nwaves break over the boat, for the moment bury it, and then as the sea\r\nrushes on, and breaks upon the wreck, the spray, flying up, hides the men\r\nlashed to the rigging from the boatmen’s sight. They hoist up a corner of\r\nthe sail to let the boat sheer in; all are ready; a huge wave lifts them.\r\n‘Pay out the cable! sharp, men! sharp!’ the coxswain shouts; ‘belay all!’\r\nThe cable was let go a few yards by the run, and the boat is alongside the\r\nwreck. With a cry, three men jump into the boat and are saved! ‘All hands\r\nto the cable! haul in hand over hand, for your lives, men, quick!’ the\r\ncoxswain cries; for he sees a tremendous wave rushing in swiftly upon\r\nthem. They haul in the cable, draw the boat a little from the wreck, the\r\nwave passes and breaks over the vessel; if the life-boat had been\r\nalongside she would have been dashed against the wreck, and perhaps\r\ncapsized, or washed over, and utterly destroyed. Again the men watch the\r\nwaves, and as they see a few smaller ones approaching, let the cable run\r\nagain, and get alongside; this time they are able to remain a little\r\nlonger by the vessel; and, one after another, thirteen of the shipwrecked\r\nmen unlash themselves from the rigging and jump into the boat, when again\r\nthey draw away from the vessel in all haste, and avoid threatened\r\ndestruction.” At last three Spaniards are left in the rigging; they seem\r\nnearly dead, and scarcely able to unlash themselves, and crawl down the\r\nshrouds. The boat must be placed dangerously near the vessel, and two of\r\nthe life-boatmen must get on to the wreck and lift the men on board. They\r\ndo it quietly, coolly, determinedly. The last one left is a poor little\r\ncabin-boy; he seems entangled in the rigging, and yet he holds fast to a\r\ncanvas bag of trinkets and things he was taking as presents to the loved\r\nones at home. “God only knows,” says Gilmore, “whether the loved ones at\r\nhome were thinking of and praying for him, and whether it was in answer to\r\ntheir prayers and those of many others that the life-boat then rode\r\nalongside that wreck, an ark of safety amid the raging seas.\r\n\r\n“They shout, the boy lingers still, his half-dead hands cannot free the\r\nbag from the entangled rigging. A moment and all are lost; a boatman makes\r\na spring, seizes the lad with a strong grasp, and tears him down the\r\nrigging into the boat—too late, too late; they cannot get away from the\r\nvessel; a tremendous wave rushes on: hold hard all, hold anchor! hold\r\ncable! give but a yard and all are lost. The boat lifts, is washed into\r\nthe fore-rigging, the sea passes, and she settles down again upon an even\r\nkeel. Thank God! If one stray rope of all the torn and tangled rigging of\r\nthe vessel had caught the boat’s rigging, or one of her spars—if the\r\nboat’s keel or cork fenders had caught in the shattered gunwale, she would\r\nhave turned over, and every man in her been shaken into the sea to speedy\r\nand certain death. Thank God! it is not so, and once more they are safe.”\r\nLook at the boat now; thirteen of its own crew, eight of the Margate and\r\nWhitstable men, the captain, mate, eight seamen, and the boy, thirty-two\r\nsouls in all. Will she be able to bring all this human freight safely to\r\nland? Their dangers are not yet over; in fact, to the poor Spaniards, the\r\nterrors of death have not yet passed away; for they know little of the\r\ngrand properties of a first-class English life-boat.\r\n\r\nNow come the difficulties of clearing the wreck. The anchor holds, and\r\nthere is no thought of getting her up in such a gale and sea. The hatchet\r\nis passed forward; there is a moment’s delay, a delay by which indeed all\r\ntheir lives are saved. Already one strand out of the three of which the\r\nstrong rope is composed is severed, when a fearful gust of wind sweeps by,\r\nthe boat heels over almost on her side—a crash is heard, and the mast and\r\nsail are blown clean out of the boat! she is carried straight for the\r\nwreck; the cable is slack, they haul it in as fast as they can, but on\r\nthey are carried swiftly, as it would seem to certain destruction. “Let\r\nthem hit the wreck full, and the next wave must throw the boat bodily upon\r\nit, and all her crew will be swept at once into the sea; let them but\r\ntouch the wreck, and the risk is fearful; on they are carried, the stem of\r\nthe boat just grazes the bow of the vessel, they must be capsized by the\r\nbowsprit and entangled in the wreckage; some of the crew are ready for a\r\nspring into the bowsprit to prolong their lives a few minutes, the others\r\nare all steadily, eagerly, quietly, hauling in upon the cable might and\r\nmain, as the only chance of safety to the boat and crew; one moment more\r\nand all are gone, one more haul upon the cable, a fathom or so comes in by\r\nthe run, and at that moment mercifully taughtens and holds, all may yet be\r\nsafe! another yard or two and the boat would have been dashed to pieces.”\r\nThis danger over, they have to think of the mast and sail dragging over\r\nthe side of the boat; it is with great difficulty that they get them on\r\nboard, and rig them up once more. At last they sail away from the Sands,\r\nthe breakers and the wreck.\r\n\r\nAnd now for the steamer, which at length they reach, passing on the way\r\nthe lugger _Eclipse_ and the Whitstable smack, to the crews of which they\r\nwere able to impart the good tidings. When they reached the steamer the\r\nsea was raging, and the gale blowing as much as ever, and it was no easy\r\ntask to get the poor shipwrecked fellows on board, as they were too\r\nexhausted to spring up her sides as the opportunity occurred; and one poor\r\nfellow was literally hauled on board with a rope. The return voyage was\r\nlittle less dangerous than the voyage out, but at last the Ramsgate\r\npier-head light shone out with its bright welcome, and cheers broke out\r\nfrom the anxious crowd, as it was known that nineteen men had been saved\r\nfrom a terrible and certain death. The Spanish sailors were well cared\r\nfor, and their captain, in speaking of the rescue, was almost overcome by\r\nhis feelings of gratitude and wonder, for he had made up his mind for\r\ndeath. He had a picture made of the rescue to take home with him to show\r\nthe Spanish authorities. It is gratifying to know that so much bravery did\r\nnot go unrewarded. The English Board of Control presented each of the men\r\nwith £2 and a medal, while the Spanish Government gratefully acknowledged\r\nthe heroic exertions put forth, by granting each a medal and £3. And all\r\nthe above is but one example of the work of our “Storm Warriors,” whose\r\nglorious mission is to save.\r\n\r\nOne stormy night some years ago the _Aid_ and the life-boat started from\r\nRamsgate in answer to rockets fired from one of the Goodwin light-vessels.\r\nThey knew well what it meant, but on reaching the edge of the Sands could\r\nnot, after cruising about some distance, find any traces of a vessel in\r\ndistress. They waited till daylight, and then were just able to\r\ndistinguish the lower mast of a steamer standing out of the water. They\r\nmade towards it, but found no trace of life, no signs of any floating\r\nwreck to which a human being could cling. They were forced to the\r\nconclusion that almost immediately upon striking, the vessel must have\r\nbroken up and sunk in the quicksand. Poor crew! poor passengers, maybe! a\r\nsharp, sudden death! Would that the vessel could have held together a\r\nlittle longer!\r\n\r\nThey had not proceeded much farther ahead in the hopes of assisting\r\nanother vessel ashore not far from Kingsgate, when the captain of the\r\n_Aid_ saw a large life-buoy floating by. “Ease her!” he cries, and the way\r\nof the steamer slackens; “God knows but what that life-buoy may be of some\r\nuse to us.” The helmsman steers for it; a sailor makes a hasty dart at it\r\nwith a boat-hook, misses it, and starts back appalled from a vision of\r\nstaring eyes, and pale and agonised faces, matted hair, and arms\r\noutstretched for help. The life-boat crew steer for the buoy; the bowman\r\ngrasps at it, but cannot lift it; his cry of horror startles the whole\r\ncrew. Some of them hasten to help him. To that buoy three dead bodies were\r\nfound lashed with ropes round their waists. Slowly and reverently, one by\r\none, the crew lifted them on board, and laid them out under the sail.\r\nThose three pale corpses were all that were ever found of the crew and\r\npassengers—to what number is not known precisely to-day—of the steamer\r\n_Violet_, which had left Ostend late the previous evening. At two o’clock\r\nshe struck the Sands; a little after three there was no one left on board\r\nto answer the signals of a steamboat that had come to their rescue, and\r\nshow their position; a little later and the _Violet_ was lying a worthless\r\nwreck below the breakers and quicksands.\r\n\r\nHappily the efforts of the life-boat and steamer’s men are almost\r\ninvariably crowned with success, where such is anything like possible. A\r\ngrand success was scored some years ago when the passengers and crew of a\r\nlarge emigrant ship, and the crew of another vessel, one hundred and\r\ntwenty in all, were rescued and brought into Ramsgate as the result of one\r\nlong night’s work. The first ship, the _Fusilier_, was found hard and fast\r\non the Sands, in a perfect boil of waters, and the life-boat alone dare\r\napproach her, the _Aid_ being obliged to lay off at some distance. The\r\nterrified passengers looked down upon the life-boat from the high ship’s\r\ndeck, which quivered with every thump on the sands, wondering how many she\r\ncould possibly save, and despairingly crowding round the two life-boat’s\r\nmen who had sprung to the man-ropes when the boat had been lifted by a sea\r\nclose to the wreck. The lights from the ship’s lamps and the faint\r\nmoonlight revealed a trembling, pale, and horror-stricken crowd,\r\nnine-tenths of whom had known nothing before of the terrors of the sea,\r\nand who still despaired of ever seeing land again. But every one of them,\r\nand the list included more than sixty women and children, were saved. The\r\nwomen and children were taken off first, helped down by sailors slung in\r\nbowlines over the vessel’s side, to the plunging, restless boat, the\r\ndangers being greatly enhanced by the helplessness and frantic terror of\r\nthe poor creatures. Yet not even a baby was lost, although many were\r\nthrown from the vessel to the outstretched arms of the life-boat men.\r\nAbout thirty persons were conveyed at a time to the steamer, where the\r\ndifficulties of transference were nearly as great as from the wreck, but\r\nat last all were safe on board. Then, as the heavily-freighted steamer\r\nturned her head for Ramsgate, the emigrants mentioned how, during the\r\nprevious night, they had seen a large ship drifting fast for the Sands,\r\nand how in the darkness they had lost sight of her. A sharp look-out was\r\ntherefore kept, and as they proceeded down Prince’s Channel, and neared\r\nthe lightship, their search was rewarded. They noted the remnants of a\r\nwreck well over on the north-east side of the Girdler Sands, and\r\nimmediately put back for the lifeboat, which had been left alongside the\r\nemigrant ship, where the captain remained in the faint hope of saving her\r\neventually. Both put back to the second wreck, the hull of which was\r\nalmost torn to pieces, the timbers started, rent, and twisted—a mere\r\nskeleton of a ship. To the foremast—hardly held in position by a remnant\r\nof shattered deck—clung sixteen of an exhausted crew, including a pilot\r\nand a boy of eleven. But a rope was successfully thrown round the\r\nfore-rigging, and slowly, one by one, the poor fellows dropped from the\r\nmast to the boat. Then “oars out,” lest a hole should be knocked through\r\nthe boat’s bottom by some part of the wreckage, and every rower strained\r\nhis utmost to get clear of her. This done, and the sail hoisted, the\r\nsteamer was soon reached, and a grand night’s work consummated. One can\r\nimagine the keen interest of the emigrants watching from the steamer the\r\nrescue of men from dangers similar to, but even greater than, those\r\nthrough which they had themselves just passed, and the enthusiasm ashore,\r\nat an almost unparalleled example of successful life-boat work.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                   “MAN THE LIFE-BOAT!” (_continued_).\r\n\r\n\r\n        A Portuguese Brig on the Sands—Futile Attempts to get her\r\n         off—Sudden Break-up—Great Danger to the Life-boat—Great\r\n        Probability of being Crushed—An Old Boatman’s Feelings—The\r\n      Life-boat herself on the Goodwin—Safe at Last—Gratitude of the\r\n          Portuguese Crew—A Blaze of Light seen from Deal—Fatal\r\n         Delay—Twenty-eight Lives Lost—A Dark December Night—The\r\n      almost-deserted Wreck of the _Providentia_—A Plucky Captain—An\r\n       Awful Episode—The Mate beaten to Death—Hardly saved—The poor\r\n    little Cabin-boy’s Rescue—Another Wreck on the Sands—Many Attempts\r\n        to rescue the Crew—Determination of the Boatmen—Victory or\r\n      Death!—The _Aid_ Steamer nearly wrecked—A novel and successful\r\n              Experiment—Anchoring on Board—The Crew Saved.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe emigrant ship mentioned in the preceding chapter was eventually got\r\noff the Sands; but although similar efforts are often made, they are by no\r\nmeans usually attended by similar results. The danger of waiting by the\r\nship is very considerable. Gilmore gives us a good example of this in his\r\naccount of a Portuguese brig on the Sands, of which there were, at first,\r\nstrong hopes of saving. Her masts and rigging, as at first seen by the\r\nRamsgate men, were all right, and her clean new copper was intact. “A\r\ngrand thing for all hands—for owners, underwriters, crew, and boatmen—the\r\nmen think, if they can only get her safely off when the tide rises, and\r\nbring her into harbour; a fine vessel and perhaps valuable cargo saved,\r\nand a pretty piece of salvage, which will be well earned, and nobody\r\nshould grudge, for the boatmen have to live, as well as to save life.” The\r\ncaptain had at first refused to employ the services offered by the crews\r\nof two Broadstairs luggers, but at last was glad to avail himself of their\r\nassistance, coupled with that of the life-boat men and the steam-tug\r\n_Aid_. The boatmen got an anchor out astern as quickly as possible, the\r\nvessel being head on to the Sands, and used other means to assist the\r\nsteamer’s work. They hoped that the _Aid_ would be able to back close\r\nenough to them, to get a rope on board fastened to the flukes of the\r\nbrig’s anchor, and to drag the anchor out, and drop it about one hundred\r\nfathoms astern of the vessel. All hands would then have gone to the\r\nwindlass, keeping a strain upon the cable, and, each time the vessel\r\nlifted, heaved with a will—the steamer, with a hundred and twenty fathoms\r\nof nine-inch cable out, towing hard all the time. By these means they\r\nexpected to be able gradually to work the vessel off the Sands. But they\r\nsoon lost hope of doing this. The gale freshened about one o’clock in the\r\nmorning; the heavy waves rolled in over the sands, and she lifted and fell\r\nwith shocks that made the masts tremble and the decks gape open. The\r\nlife-boat remained alongside, afloat in the basin that the brig had worked\r\nin the sands, and it took all the efforts of the men on board to prevent\r\nher getting under the side of the vessel, and being crushed. The\r\nPortuguese captain still refused to desert his vessel, while the boatmen,\r\nwho knew the danger, were almost ready to force the crew to leave the\r\nship.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a loud sharp crack, like a crash of thunder, pealed through the\r\nship. One of her large timbers had snapped like a pipe-stem, and now the\r\nPortuguese sailors were only too anxious to leave. Even then, however,\r\nthey made a rush to get their things, and soon eight sea-chests hampered\r\nthe life-boat. The captain did not like to refuse the poor fellows,\r\nalthough every moment was of consequence. The surf flew over the brig, and\r\nboiled up all around her; the life-boat, deluged with spray, had all her\r\nlights washed out. The snapping and rending of the brig’s timbers was\r\nheard over the fury of the storm; she was breaking up fast. The boy was\r\nhanded to the boat, the sailors following, and the brig was abandoned. But\r\nthe danger was far from over.\r\n\r\nThe steamer and the luggers, exposed to the full fury of the increasing\r\ngale, were outside, the former head to wind, steaming half-power. The\r\nsteamer endeavoured to keep in the neighbourhood of the wreck and of the\r\nlife-boat. One of the luggers had to cut her cable, without attempting to\r\nsave her anchor, and make with all speed for Ramsgate; the second sprung\r\nher mast, which was fished with great difficulty, and she too made the\r\nbest of her way for the harbour. The crew of the steamer could see nothing\r\nof the boat—Was she swamped or stove, and all lost? They made signals, but\r\nto no purpose; and the _Aid_ cruised up and down the edge of the dangerous\r\nsands as near as might be, hoping against hope. The night was pitchy dark,\r\nand the storm remained at its worst. Through the thick darkness the bright\r\nlight of the Goodwin light-vessel shone out like a star. With a faint\r\nhope, the crew of the steamer wrestled their way through the storm, and\r\nspoke the light-ship. Nothing had been seen of the life-boat. They\r\nhastened to their old cruising-ground. How they longed for the light! All\r\nhands were still on watch, and as the faint grey light of dawning came,\r\nthey sought with straining eyeballs to penetrate the twilight, and find\r\nsome sign of their lost comrades. It was almost broad daylight before they\r\ncould find the place where the wreck was lying, and when they discovered\r\nit, lost all hope, for the brig was found completely broken up, actually\r\ntorn to pieces. They could see great masses of splintered timber and\r\ntangled rigging, but not a sign of life. Sadly they turned from the fatal\r\nGoodwin, and made for the harbour.\r\n\r\nTo return to the life-boat, afloat within the circle of the bed worked by\r\nthe brig in her wild careering. She could not by any possibility leave,\r\nthough the wreck threatened to roll over her every moment, for outside\r\nwere the shallow sands, and she was grounding every few moments. “Crash!\r\nthe brig heaves, and crushes down upon her bilge; again and again,” says\r\nthe narrator, “she half lifts upon an even keel, and rolls and lurches\r\nfrom side to side; each time that she falls to leeward she comes more and\r\nmore over, and nearer to the boat.\r\n\r\n“This is the danger that may well make the stoutest heart quail. The boat\r\nis aground—helplessly aground; her crew can see through the darkness of\r\nthe night the yards and masts of the brig swaying over their heads, now\r\ntossing high in the air as the brig rights, and now falling nearer and\r\nnearer to them, sweeping down over their heads, swaying and rending in the\r\nair, the blocks, and ropes, and torn fragments of sails flying wildly in\r\nall directions. Let but one of the swaying yards hit the boat, she must be\r\ncrushed, and all lost. The men crouch down closer and closer, clinging to\r\nthe thwarts as the brig falls to them, casting dread glances at the\r\napproaching yards; all right once more; another pull at the cable—hard,\r\nmen, hard; over again comes the brig; stick to it, stick to it, my men;\r\ncrushed or drowned, it will be soon over if we cannot move the boat;\r\nanother pull, all together; again and again they make desperate efforts to\r\nstir the boat, but she will not move one inch; they must wait, and, if\r\nneeds be, wait their doom.” And so through hours of fearful suspense, half\r\ndead with cold and the ceaseless rush of surf over them, watching in the\r\nshadowy darkness the swaying masts and flying blocks, expecting each\r\nmoment to be their last.\r\n\r\nBut at length a dawn of hope arrived; the boat lifted on the swell of the\r\ntide that was beginning to reach her, and though she immediately grounded\r\nagain, the men knew that all was not lost. After desperate hauling on the\r\ncable they at last were able to ride to their anchor a few yards clear of\r\nthe brig. But to get away from the sand in the face of the fierce gale and\r\ntide was impossible, and so there was no alternative, they must beat right\r\nacross the sands, and this in the wild fearful gale, and terrible sea, and\r\npitch-dark night. Breaker after breaker rushed furiously towards and over\r\nthem; the men were nearly washed out of the boat; and, worse, the anchor\r\nbegan to drag, and every moment they drifted nearer to the wreck again.\r\nThere might now be water enough to take them clear; at all events, they\r\nmust risk it. The foresail was hoisted and the cable cut, and she leaped\r\nforward, but only for a few yards, when she grounded upon the sands again\r\nwith a terrible shock, and again within reach of the brig. Huge breakers\r\ncame tearing along, and, at last, after many such experiences, they were\r\nonce more clear of the wreck. Then another danger arose. A small life-boat\r\nbelonging to the Broadstairs men had been in tow all this time, and when\r\nthe Ramsgate boat grounded she came crashing along into her. The Ramsgate\r\nmen had, in the midst of the boiling sea, to fend her off with their feet,\r\nand at last cut her adrift. The sea-chests of the Portuguese sailors—or at\r\nleast those not already washed away—were thrown overboard. Again and again\r\nshe grounded on the sand ridges washed up by the surf—ridges giant\r\neditions of the little sand-ripples on the sea-shore so well remembered by\r\nall visitors to our coasts, but two and three feet high, instead of as\r\nmany inches.\r\n\r\n“One old boatman,” says Gilmore, “afterwards thus described his\r\nfeelings:—‘Well, sir, perhaps my friends were right when they said I\r\nhadn’t ought to have gone out—that I was too old for that sort of work’\r\n(he was then about sixty years of age), ‘but, you see, when there is life\r\nto be saved, it makes one feel young again; and I’ve always felt I had a\r\ncall to save life when I could, and I wasn’t going to hang back then. And\r\nI stood it better than some of them, after all. I did my work on board the\r\nbrig, and when she was so near falling over us, and when the _Dreadnought_\r\nlife-boat seemed knocking our bottom out, I got on as well as any of them;\r\nbut when we got to beating and grubbing over the sands, swinging round and\r\nround, and grounding every few yards with a jerk that bruised us sadly,\r\nand almost tore our arms out from the sockets; no sooner washed off one\r\nridge, and beginning to hope that the boat was clear, than she thumped\r\nupon another harder than ever, and all the time the wash of the surf\r\nnearly carrying us out of the boat—it was truly almost too much for any\r\nman to stand. There was a young fellow holding on next to me; I saw his\r\nhead begin to drop, and that he was getting faint, and going to give over;\r\nand when the boat filled with water, and the waves went over his head, he\r\nscarcely cared to struggle free. I tried to cheer him a bit, and keep his\r\nspirits up. He just clung to the thwart like a drowning man. Poor fellow!\r\nhe never did a day’s work after that night, and died in a few months.’ And\r\nthen the old man described how he took his life-belt off, that he might\r\nhave it over all the quicker; how the captain cheered them up by crying\r\nout, ‘We’ll see Ramsgate yet again, my men, if we steer clear of old\r\nwrecks;’ and how he was going off into a kind of stupor when the clouds\r\nbroke a little, and one bright star shone out, a star of life and hope to\r\nhim. For seven whole days after the poor old man reached shore he lost his\r\nspeech, and lay like a log on his bed, while all the men were considerably\r\nshaken. ‘I cannot describe it,’ said he, ‘and you cannot, neither can any\r\none else; but when you say you’ve beat and thumped over those sands,\r\nalmost yard by yard, in a fearful storm on a winter’s night, and live to\r\ntell the tale, why it seems to me about the next thing to saying that\r\nyou’ve been dead, and brought to life again.’”\r\n\r\nBut suddenly the swinging and beating of the boat ceased: she was in a\r\nheavy sea, but in deep water, and she answered her helm. The crew soon got\r\nmore sail on her, and she made good way before the gale. Even the\r\nPortuguese sailors lifted their heads. They had been clinging together and\r\nto the boat, crouching down under the lee of the foresail, utterly\r\ndespairing of life; now their joy knew no bounds. They were noticed\r\nearnestly consulting together. They had lost their kits, and only\r\npossessed the clothes they stood in and a few pounds in money (about £17)\r\nbetween them, but the latter they determined to present to the crew. “I,\r\nfor one, won’t touch any of it,” said the coxswain of the boat. “Nor I!”\r\n“Nor I!” all added; “put your money up.” And so to the harbour, where\r\ntheir consul took care of them. When the steamer arrived later on, what\r\nwas not the surprise and delight of the captain and all hands to find the\r\nlife-boat at her old moorings, and their comrades in so many dangers all\r\nsafe in port!\r\n\r\nFor by far the larger proportion if not indeed nearly the whole of these\r\nlife-savers work _con amore_, and a mishap or positive disaster is often\r\nto them an agonising disappointment. One stormy New Year’s Eve some years\r\nago “a ship was seen off Deal beach in almost a blaze of light, burning\r\ntar-barrels and firing rockets, to tell of her distress; an intervening\r\nfog seemed to prevent the look-out on board the light-vessel seeing her,\r\nand some boatmen on Deal beach, who could not possibly get their boats off\r\nthe sands in the face of the strong gale blowing straight on shore, put\r\ntheir halfpence together to pay for a telegraph message—the messages were\r\ndearer then than they are now—and sent their swiftest runner to telegraph\r\nto Ramsgate; and, after all, there was some unfortunate mistake, and fatal\r\ndelay, and a telegram at last sent for further particulars, which was\r\nanswered with a demand for urgent speed, and away then flew steamer and\r\nlife-boat, and they neared the wreck, and rounded to, to send the\r\nlife-boat in, when some of the boatmen thought they heard an agonising\r\nshriek, and others thought it was only the wail of the storm; but they\r\nlooked, and the great green seas swept over the wreck, turned her right\r\nover, and she was seen no more, and twenty-eight lives went to their\r\naccount. A piteous New Year’s tale it was that was told next morning. A\r\nboat’s crew got away from the ship soon after she struck, and, battling\r\nthrough the broken seas, made way before the wind to Dover, and they told\r\nthe story that the lost vessel had picked up a shipwrecked crew, who were\r\nthus a second time wrecked, and at the second time lost; and that more of\r\nthe crew would have come away in the boat, and in other boats, but it was\r\na great risk; and there was a Deal pilot on board, who pointed out the\r\ndanger, and said that the Ramsgate life-boat was sure to be out to their\r\nrescue, they might be sure of her; and so they stayed and lighted\r\ntar-barrel after tar-barrel, and fired rocket after rocket; and when the\r\nsea washed their signal-fires out and swept the decks, they took to the\r\nrigging, and waited for the life-boat; and as they waited, the poor Deal\r\npilot could watch the light on the beach, by the house where slept his\r\nwife and eight children, who were to call him husband—father—no more.” The\r\nlife-boat men hardly like to speak of such a cruel disaster—blameless\r\nthough they be in the matter. In this particular case a Board of Trade\r\ninquiry acquitted them and all else concerned of any blame whatever.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: A GROUP OF LIFE-BOAT MEN.]\r\n\r\nA dark December night, and a large ship reported ashore on the Goodwins.\r\nThe harbour-master hurries to Ramsgate pier-head; he and all with him can\r\nsee nothing; they cross-question the man who asserts that he observed\r\nduring a lift in the fog a vessel on the sands. Although there is no\r\nsignal from the light-vessels, the harbour-master decides to send out\r\nsteamer and life-boat. The crews of both soon discover the vessel looming\r\nthrough the mist, a complete wreck, her bow to the sea, her mizen-mast\r\ndown to the deck, and the wild seas running over her. There are no sailors\r\nto be seen lashed in her rigging. Have all on board perished?\r\n\r\nThank God! not so. After infinite difficulty, and after nearly getting\r\nentangled with some of the wreckage, the life-boat crew get near the\r\nvessel, and find that three men and a boy are crouching under the shelter\r\nof the deck-house; they must be a small proportion of the original crew,\r\nfor she is a large ship, and must have had some fifteen or sixteen hands\r\naboard. The men have been crouching there for hours, and their confidence\r\nin the advent of the life-boat had been so strong that they had prepared\r\nfor her coming by preparing a life-buoy, with a long line fastened to it,\r\nready to throw overboard.\r\n\r\nAs the long hours passed, fervent hope had been dashed by wild despair.\r\nSuddenly the life-boat appears, coming up to her cable just astern of the\r\nvessel; it is to them as a reprieve from death, and they wake to life and\r\naction. They throw the life-buoy and line to the life-boat men, and after\r\nmuch trouble the latter get it on board. All hands lay hold on the rope,\r\nand do their utmost to haul the life-boat nearer to the wreck, but the\r\nheavy gale, terrific sea, and strong tide, render it impossible. A\r\ntremendous sea comes rushing over the vessel, and for the moment swamps\r\nthe boat, knocking down five or six of the men, hurting some of them\r\nseverely, but she lifts again, and no one is lost. But what of the poor\r\ncrew? The life-boat men feel that it is impossible to haul their boat\r\nnearer the ship.\r\n\r\n“To their great surprise, they see the captain spring up from the lee of\r\nthe deck-house, hurriedly take off his oilskin coat, throw it into the\r\nwater, and then, jumping on the gunwale, grasp the hawser that holds the\r\nboat, and slide down into the boiling sea. A huge wave breaks over him and\r\nwashes him away from the rope; he now tries to swim to the boat, but the\r\nlife-boat is not directly astern—the sheer she has to her cable that is\r\nfastened to the anchor, which was thrown over some distance to the side of\r\nthe vessel, prevents her dropping right astern; and although the captain\r\nhas but to swim a few yards out of the direction of the sweep of sea and\r\ntide, it is impossible for him to manage it. He is perfectly overwhelmed\r\nby the boil of sea, tossed wildly up and down, wave after wave beating\r\nover him: it is all that he can do to keep his head above water, and\r\ncannot guide his course in the least; the boatmen try all they can to make\r\nthe boat sheer towards him, so as to reach him or throw him a rope, but it\r\nis impossible: they cannot get sufficiently near, and in a few seconds\r\nthey see him swept rapidly by in the swift tide. Jarman, the coxswain of\r\nthe boat, seizes a life-buoy, and throws it with all his force towards\r\nhim; the wind catches it, and helps the throw; it falls near him; he makes\r\na spring forward and reaches it; the men gladly see that he has got it;\r\nthey see him put his two hands upon one side, as if to get upon it; as he\r\nleans forward it falls over his head like a hoop; he gets his arms through\r\nit, and shouting to the boatmen, ‘All right!’ he waves his hand as if to\r\nbeckon them to follow him, and goes floating down in the strong tide and\r\namong the raging, leaping seas, in a strange wild dance, that threatens\r\nindeed to be a dance of death.” With terror and dismay they watch him in\r\nhis fearful struggle, till he is lost to their view, quite out of sight\r\namong the waves; they could not follow him, however much they might have\r\nwished it, for it might be hours before they could get back to the ship,\r\nand the two men and boy still aboard.\r\n\r\nAnd had they thought of so doing the next episode would have obliged them\r\nto desist. A tremendous crash startles them all; the mainmast has fallen\r\nover the port side of the vessel. The men on board give a loud cry; the\r\nchief mate springs wildly to the starboard quarter, and, making the end of\r\nthe mainbrace hanging there fast round his waist, drops into the sea. He\r\nis a powerful swimmer; but what can he do in a tide and sea so tremendous\r\nthat twelve strong men cannot haul the boat one foot against them? And so\r\na fearful tragedy is worked out before their very eyes. Now he is buried\r\nin a sea; now he is thrown high in the air on the crest of a wave, but he\r\nnever nears the boat, nor can it near him. He strikes out wildly, as if to\r\nmake a last effort, and cries aloud in his agony and despair. They try\r\nagain and again to throw the lead-line over the rope which holds the poor\r\nfellow, but the boat is pitching and tossing so much that their efforts\r\nare all in vain. “‘Now he rises on a wave; now try; heave with a will,\r\nwell clear of his head. Ah! missed again; look out; hold on all!’ A wave\r\nrushes over them, boat and all; another half minute, and they make another\r\nattempt. No! all in vain, each time it falls short. The struggle cannot\r\nlast long; strong and young as the man is, his strength cannot possibly\r\nendure long in such a conflict; his cries grow more feeble, and soon\r\ncease; they see him try and get back to the ship, climbing up the rope,\r\nbut his strength fails, and he falls back; his arms and legs are still\r\ntossed wildly about, but it is by the action of the waves; his head drops\r\nand sinks; yes! it is all over!—all over with him!” Think of the second\r\nmate and cabin-boy on the wreck, watching in helpless horror the death\r\nthey could not avert, and which may be theirs in a few moments!\r\n\r\nThe deck-house under which they have been crouching is beginning to break\r\nup, and the remaining man, throwing himself on the rope by which the\r\nlife-boat is made fast to the ship, attempts to reach the boat. The\r\nbreakers rush over him as he painfully struggles on, and he is again and\r\nagain buried in the waves. At last he reaches the high bow of the\r\nlife-boat, which is leaping and falling and jerking, tearing the hawser up\r\nand down in the seas, as if trying to throw him from his hold. His hands\r\nconvulsively clutch the rope; pale, and with jaw dropping, he seems about\r\nto swoon, and in another moment he will be gone. “The man in the bow of\r\nthe boat has been watching his every movement, has shuddered with dismay\r\nas he saw the seas wash over him, expecting him to be carried away in the\r\nstrong tide. No; he still grasps the rope, and at last is within reach! In\r\none spring, and with a cry to his mates, ‘Hold me! hold me!’ the boatman\r\nthrows himself upon the raised fore-deck of the life-boat, and, with his\r\nbody half-stretched over the stern, he grasps the collar of the sailor.\r\nThe drowning man throws his arm around the boatman’s neck, and clings to\r\nhim convulsively, by his weight dragging the man’s head down and burying\r\nit in the water; but the brave fellow clings as hard to the half-dead\r\nsailor as the sailor does to him; the seas wash bodily over them and over\r\nthe bow of the boat; up and down the boat plunges them both, but he still\r\nholds on; three or four of the boatmen have hold of his legs, and are\r\ndoing their utmost to pull him back into the boat, but they cannot do so;\r\nand so the struggle goes on: it is only as the boat rises on a wave and\r\nthrows her bow up in the air that the men can breathe.” And now a new\r\nhorror, for right down upon them comes the wreck of one of the ship’s\r\nlargest boats, which has just got free of the wreckage. Thank God! it just\r\npasses clear of them. The boatmen cannot get the men in over the high bow\r\nof the boat, and the two poor fellows are drowning fast, and so they drag\r\nthem along the side of the boat, still clinging together, to the waist of\r\nthe boat, where the gunwale is very low, and with more assistance succeed\r\nin getting them aboard.\r\n\r\n                  [Illustration: ON THE COAST AT DEAL.]\r\n\r\nAnd now for the poor boy, still clinging to the gunwale, and crying out in\r\npiteous tones. Each moment, as the waves dash over the vessel, the boatmen\r\nexpect to see him washed overboard like a cork. What can be done? No one\r\ncan mount the rope in the face of the seas and tide which had really\r\nhelped the poor fellow now safely on the boat. There seems no hope of\r\ntaking him off by any means whatever, but the coxswain determines to haul\r\nthe boat up to the ship sharply, and attempt it. Scarcely are the orders\r\ngiven, when some of the men give a cry, “‘What’s that? look out!’ Yes, he\r\nis overboard, washed over by that big sea. ‘Where is he? where is he?\r\nThere he is! No; only his cap! there he lifts on that sea—he is coming\r\nstraight for the boat!’ From the change and eddy of the tide, the rush of\r\nthe sea past the boat is not nearly so rapid as it was, and the poor boy\r\ncomes floating slowly from the ship; once or twice he has been rolled\r\nunder by the waves, now he is on the surface again, and near the boat.\r\n‘Here he comes! look! on that wave! Lost! No, he floats again! Slacken\r\nhawsers! Now he is within reach! Carefully, quick! Now you have got him!\r\nHe is making no effort, and floating with his head under water!’ A boatman\r\nmanages to hook his jacket with a long boat-hook, and pulls him towards\r\nthe boat; gently the men lift him in, sorrowfully, and tears are in the\r\neyes of more than one as they look upon the small face. ‘Poor little chap!\r\nToo late! too late! he’s gone!’” Their efforts are now all needed to get\r\nclear of the wreck, cut the cable, and raise the sail, all which being\r\ndone successfully, they go off smartly before the wind, and have time to\r\nlook to the poor boy again. Kind hands chafe his hands and rub his back\r\nand limbs, and put a little rum to his lips, and after about half an hour\r\nthey have the joy of seeing him show signs of life, and their efforts are\r\nredoubled. Some of the men take the dryest of their jackets and wrap him\r\nup tenderly, lying him under the mizen-sail. He eventually recovers.\r\n\r\nBut, strangest part of all this eventful story, the captain, who had been\r\ntwo hours in the seething waters, is picked up alive, although, it may\r\nwell be believed, in a terrible state of exhaustion. At first he seems to\r\nbe dying, but at length, after the men have done their best in chafing and\r\nrubbing, he gets a little better, and is able to tell them that his\r\nvessel, the _Providentia_, was a full-rigged ship from Finland, and that\r\nhe himself is a Russian Fin, which accounts for his miraculous\r\npreservation in the water, as the Fins are the hardiest of sailors. Eleven\r\nof his men had left the ship in their best boat, and were, it was\r\neventually found, blown over to Boulogne.\r\n\r\nThe waves are rolling along in all their fury, and beat down upon the\r\nsands with tremendous force, and among them, and settled down somewhat, is\r\na large barque. The life-boat men look at the awful rage of sea, and say\r\nto each other, “We have indeed our work cut out for us.” There are no\r\nsigns of life on board the wreck, but the flag of distress is still\r\nflying, and the steamer tows the boat nearer to her. Then the crew is\r\ndiscovered crouching in the shelter of the deck-house, while the huge\r\nwaves make a complete breach over the vessel, threatening to wash away\r\nboth house and crew. The steamer takes the boat to windward and lets her\r\ngo. The boat’s sail is hoisted, and she makes for the wreck. A minute more\r\nand they are in the broken water, the seas falling in tangled volumes over\r\nthe boat, and she is tossed in all directions by the wild broken waves.\r\nShe fills again and again, and the men have to cling with all their\r\nstrength to the thwarts; but still the wind drives the boat on, and they\r\nget within about sixty yards of the wreck, when the anchor is thrown out\r\nand the cable paid out swiftly. The men shout out, to encourage the poor\r\ntrembling wretches on board, and, just as they expect to make a first\r\nsuccessful rescue of a part of them, are nearly swamped by a fearful wave,\r\nwhich carries them a hundred yards away. They prepare for another attempt,\r\nhoist the sail, and try to sheer her to the vessel, but all their efforts\r\nare in vain. Wave after wave breaks over them, and the boat is tossed in\r\nall directions by the broken seas. Sometimes the coxswain feels as if he\r\nwould be thrown bodily forward on the men, as the waves almost lift the\r\nboat end on end. They must give it up for this time; the very oars are\r\nblown from the row-locks and out of the men’s hands. Again and again they\r\nare baulked in their efforts to reach the ill-starred vessel. Yet again\r\nand again they cheer, to keep up the spirits of its half-drowned and\r\nfrozen crew.\r\n\r\nThe ship’s hull has now been under water for some time, and is breaking up\r\nfast. On board the _Aid_ the mortar apparatus is got ready, in the hope of\r\ngetting near enough to the vessel to fire a line into her rigging.\r\n“Cautiously the steamer approaches; the tide has been for some time rising\r\nfast; the steamer does not draw much water; they are almost within firing\r\ndistance; the waves come rushing along and nearly overrun the steamer; at\r\nlast a breaker, larger than the rest, catches her, lifts her high upon its\r\ncrest, and letting her fall down into its trough as down the side of a\r\nwell, she strikes the sands heavily; the engines are instantly reversed;\r\nshe lifts with the next wave, and being a very quick and handy boat, at\r\nonce moves astern before she can thump again, and they are saved from\r\nshipwreck; and thus the fifth effort to save the shipwrecked crew fails.”\r\nNo time is lost; at once the steamer heads for the life-boat, and makes\r\nready to again tow her into position for a fresh attempt. The masts of the\r\nwreck are quivering, and it is evident that she is breaking up fast.\r\n\r\nThe life-boat men consult together as to the plan of their next effort. At\r\nlast one of the men proposes a mode, most assuredly novel, and which must,\r\nindeed, either prove rescue to the shipwrecked or death to all. “I’ll tell\r\nyou what, my men, if we are going to save those poor fellows, there is\r\nonly one way of doing it: it must be a case of save all or lose all, that\r\nis just it! We must go in upon the vessel straight, hit her between the\r\nmasts, and throw our anchor over right upon her decks.” This is, almost\r\nnaturally, derided by some as a hair-brained trick. Let us see the result.\r\n\r\n“Once more the boat heads for the wreck—this time to do or to die; each\r\nman knows it, each man feels it. They are crossing the stern of the\r\nvessel. ‘Look at that breaker! Look at that breaker! Hold on! hold on! It\r\nwill be all over with us if it catches us; we shall be thrown high into\r\nthe masts of the vessel, and shaken out into the sea in a moment! Hold on\r\nall, hold on! Now it comes! No, thank God! it breaks ahead of us, and we\r\nhave escaped. Now, men, be ready, be ready!’ Thus shouts the coxswain.\r\nEvery man is at his station; some with the ropes in hand ready to lower\r\nthe sails, others by the anchor, prepared to throw it overboard at the\r\nright moment; round, past the stern of the vessel, the boat flies, round\r\nin the blast of the gale and the swell of the sea; down helm; round she\r\ncomes; down foresail; the ship’s lee gunwale is under water; the boat\r\nshoots forward straight for the wreck, and hits the lee rail with a shock\r\nthat almost throws all the men from their posts, and then, still forward,\r\nshe literally leaps on board the wreck. Over! over with the anchor. It\r\nfalls on the vessel’s deck. All the crew of the vessel are in the mizen\r\nshrouds, but they cannot get to the boat: a fearful rush of sea is chasing\r\nover the vessel, and between them and it. Again and again the boat thumps\r\non the wreck as on a rock, with a shock that almost shakes the men from\r\ntheir hold.” The waves carry her off, but the anchor holds, and they\r\nmanage to haul on board another line. Again and again the boat washes\r\naway, but comes up to the vessel again; and, one by one, ten poor Danes\r\nare got on board. One sailor jumps from the rigging; the boat sinks in the\r\ntrough of the sea, and he falls between her and the wreck; a second, and\r\nhe would be crushed; two boatmen seize him, and are themselves seized by\r\ntheir companions, or they would go overboard.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: RESCUE OF THE DANISH VESSEL.]\r\n\r\nThe long battle was over; was it not one worth fighting? So thought the\r\nKing of Denmark, who sent two hundred rix-dollars to be divided among the\r\nmen, who were also rewarded by the Board of Trade. The boatmen are poor\r\nmen, and such presents come in very acceptably; but their greatest\r\nsatisfaction must ever come from the memory of their own brave deeds.\r\n\r\n      [Illustration: SURVIVORS RESCUED FROM THE RIGGING OF A WRECK.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                       “WRECKING” AS A PROFESSION.\r\n\r\n\r\n    Probable Fate of a rich Vessel in the Middle Ages—Maritime Laws of\r\n          the Period—The King’s Privileges—Cœur de Lion and his\r\n          Enactments—The Rôles d’Oleron—False Pilots and Wicked\r\n          Lords—Stringent Laws of George II.—The Homeward-bound\r\n     Vessel—Plotting Wreckers—Lured Ashore—“Dead Men Tell no Tales”—A\r\n      Series of Facts—Brutality to a Captain and his Wife—Fate of a\r\n     Plunderer—Defence of a Ship against Hundreds of Wreckers—Another\r\n           Example—Ship Boarded by Peasantry—Police Attacked by\r\n        Thousands—Cavalry Charge the Wreckers—Hundreds of Drunken\r\n      Plunderers—A Curious Tract of the Last Century—A Professional\r\n                Wrecker’s Arguments—A Candid Bahama Pilot.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe great historian, Hallam, says: “In the thirteenth and fourteenth\r\ncenturies a rich vessel was never secure from attack, and neither\r\nrestitution nor punishment of the criminals was to be obtained from\r\nGovernment, who sometimes feared the plunderer, and sometimes connived at\r\nthe offence.” As we have seen before, some of the greatest names of the\r\nElizabethan and later days were often not much better than legalised\r\npirates. But the poor sailors and owners were not merely the prey of these\r\nsea wolves; there were then and for centuries afterwards, nearly to our\r\nown days, “land-rats” ashore, who were to the pirates what sneak-thieves\r\nwere to the highwaymen of romance. Those “good old days,” when “wrecking”\r\nwas considered a legitimate pursuit!\r\n\r\nIn preceding chapters the maritime laws and customs of successive ages\r\nhave been briefly traced. Piracy was almost openly recognised in the\r\nthirteenth and fourteenth centuries, and a foreign ship with a rich cargo\r\nwas too often regarded as rightful prey. There was a constant petty\r\nwarfare between maritime nations, and frequently even between towns of the\r\nsame nation. Thus, in the year 1254 some Winchelsea mariners attacked a\r\nYarmouth vessel, and killed some of her crew.\r\n\r\nPrior to the reign of Henry I. _all_ wrecked property belonged to the\r\nking. Whether it was found necessary to make the king the owner of\r\nwreckage, in order to lessen the temptation to wreck vessels and murder\r\nthe crews—no unfrequent occurrence, even in the last century—or “however\r\nit was,” says Gilmore, “the law existed, and the shipwrecked merchant\r\nmight come struggling ashore upon a broken spar, and find the coast strewn\r\nwith scattered but still valuable goods so lately his, but now by law his\r\nno longer any more than they belonged to the half-dozen rude fishermen who\r\nstood watching the torn wreck and dispersed cargo being wave-lifted high\r\nupon the beach.” Henry I. decreed that neither wreck nor cargo should\r\nbecome the property of the Crown if any man of the crew escaped with life\r\nto shore. It is to be feared that this well-meant law led to many a\r\nheartless murder. His successor expanded the law to the extent that if\r\neven a beast came ashore alive, the wreck and goods should belong to the\r\noriginal owners. Even the proverbial cat with nine lives might thus save a\r\nvessel.\r\n\r\nRichard Cœur de Lion, always truly chivalrous, would have nought to do\r\nwith plundering the plundered, and he decreed “that all persons escaping\r\nalive from a wreck should retain their goods; that wreck or wreckage\r\nshould only be considered the property of the king when neither an owner\r\nnor the heir of a late owner could be found for it.” Some authorities will\r\nnot couple the name of Richard with the “Rôles d’Oleron,” but it is\r\ncertain that they were first promulgated in or about his time. They afford\r\nus some idea of the terrible system of wrecking then prevalent; such laws\r\nwould not have been promulgated without good reason. Note their\r\nstringency.\r\n\r\n“An accursed custom prevailing in some parts; inasmuch as a third or\r\nfourth part of the wrecks that come ashore belong to the lord of the manor\r\nwhere the wrecks take place, and that pilots, for profit from these lords\r\nand from the wrecks, like faithless and treacherous villains, do purposely\r\nrun the ships under their care upon the rocks,” the law declares “that all\r\nfalse pilots shall suffer a most rigorous and merciless death, and be hung\r\non high gibbets;” while “the wicked lords are to be tied to a post in the\r\nmiddle of their own houses, which shall be set on fire at all four\r\ncorners, and burnt, with all that shall be therein, the goods being first\r\nconfiscated for the benefit of the persons injured, and the site of the\r\nhouses shall be converted into places for the sale of hogs and swine.” And\r\nagain, “If people, more barbarous, cruel, and inhuman than mad dogs,\r\nmurdered shipwrecked folk, they were to be plunged into the sea until half\r\ndead, and then drawn out and stoned to death.” The pilot who negligently\r\ncaused shipwreck was to make good the losses or lose his head; but the\r\nmaster and sailors were, as a saving clause (principally for the owners!),\r\nto be persuaded that he had not the means to make good the loss _before\r\nthey cut off his head_.\r\n\r\nAnd so, without much change, the laws stood till the reign of George II.;\r\nand, alas! it does not seem that human nature, on our coasts at least, had\r\ngreatly improved, for otherwise there would hardly have been necessity for\r\na new Act, bristling with threats. The preamble states:—“That\r\nnotwithstanding the good and salutary laws now in being against plundering\r\nand destroying vessels in distress, and against taking away shipwrecked,\r\nlost, and stranded goods, that still many wicked enormities had been\r\ncommitted, to the disgrace of the nation;” and it was therefore enacted\r\nthat death should be the punishment for hanging out false lights to lure\r\nvessels to their destruction; death for those who killed shipwrecked\r\npersons; and death for stealing cargo or wreckage, whether any one on\r\nboard remained alive or not.\r\n\r\nEvery now and again some fearful tragedy, reported in our ever-vigilant\r\npress, opens our eyes to the possibilities of human degradation and\r\ndepravity; but, in spite of all, thank God! these examples are few and far\r\nbetween. Does this not tend, at least, to show that the world now-a-days\r\n_is_ better and kinder, and, in a word, more Christian-like, than in\r\nformer days? Let the reader think—aye, and ponder, and think again—over\r\nthe preceding paragraph. Could men—aye, and women too—assist not merely in\r\nrobbery and plunder, but in first causing the wreck, and then, to cover up\r\nall, in murdering the few poor survivors? A writer from whom we have\r\nalready quoted says:—\r\n\r\n“Imagine a homeward-bound vessel, some two hundred and fifty years ago,\r\nclumsy in build, awkward in rig, little fitted for battling with the gales\r\nof our stormy coast, but yet manned with strong, stout-hearted men, who\r\nmade their sturdy courage compensate for deficiency of other means; think\r\nof many perils overcome, a long weary voyage nearly ended, the crew\r\nrejoicing in thoughts of home, of home-love and home-rest, the headlands\r\nof dear Old England—loved by her sons no less then than now—lying a dark\r\nline upon the horizon, the night growing apace, the breeze freshening,\r\never freshening, adding each moment a hoarser swell to the deep murmurs of\r\nits swift-following blasts, the ship scudding on, breasting the seas with\r\nher bluff bows, rising and pitching with the running waves, which cover\r\nher with foam!\r\n\r\n“Look on land! Keen eyes have watched the signs of the coming storm; men,\r\nmore greedy than the foulest vulture, ‘more inhuman than mad dogs,’ have\r\ncast most cruel and wistful glances seaward! Yes, their eyes light up with\r\nthe very light of hell as they see in the dim distance the white sail of a\r\nstruggling ship making towards the land!\r\n\r\n“And now try to imagine the scene as the night falls and the storm\r\ngathers. Two or three ill-looking fellows drop in, say, to a low tavern\r\nstanding in a bye-lane that leads from the cliff to the beach in some\r\nvillage on our south-western coast. Soon muttered hints take form, and in\r\nlow whispers the men talk over the chances of a wreck this wild night.\r\nThey remember former gains; they talk over disappointments, when, on\r\nsimilar nights of darkness, wildness, and storm, vessels discovered their\r\ndanger too soon for them, and managed to weather the headlands of the bay.\r\n\r\n“The plot takes form; with many a deep and muttered curse the murderous\r\ndecision is taken that if a vessel can be trapped to destruction it shall\r\nbe.\r\n\r\n“There is an old man of the party whose brow is furrowed with dread lines;\r\nhe does not say much, but every now and then his eyes glare, and his\r\nfeatures work as if convulsed. His comrades look at him—twice—and, as a\r\nterrific squall shakes the house, a third time. Silently he rises, and\r\nleaves the inn.... Now in the pitch darkness of the night, with bowed\r\nhead, and faltering steps battling against the storm, the old man leads a\r\nwhite horse along the edge of the cliff. To the top of the horse’s tail a\r\nlantern is tied, and the light sways with the movement of the horse, and\r\nin its movements seems not unlike the masthead light of a vessel rocked by\r\nthe motion of the sea. A whisper has gone through the village of a chance\r\nof something happening during the night, and most of the men and many of\r\nthe women are on the alert, lurking in the caves beneath the cliff, or\r\nsheltered behind jutting pieces of rock.\r\n\r\n“The vessel makes in steadily for the land; the captain grows uneasy, and\r\nfears running into danger; he will put the vessel round, and try and\r\nbattle his way out to sea.\r\n\r\n“The look-out man reports a dim light ahead. What kind? and Whither away?\r\nHe can make out that it is a ship’s light, for it is in motion. Yes, she\r\nmust be a vessel standing on in the same course as that which they are on.\r\nIt is all safe, then; the captain will stand in a little longer; when\r\nsuddenly, in the lull of the storm, a hoarse murmur is heard—surely the\r\nsound of the sea beating upon rocks! Yes! look! a white gleam upon the\r\nwater! Breakers ahead! breakers ahead! Oh, a very knell of doom! The cry\r\nrings through the ship, ‘Down, down with helm—round her to!’ Too late, too\r\nlate! A crash, a shudder from stem to stern of the stout ship, the shriek\r\nof many voices in their agony, green seas sweeping over the vessel, and\r\nsoon broken timbers, bales of cargo, and lifeless bodies scattered along\r\nthe beach, while the shattered remnant of the hull is torn still further\r\nto pieces with each insweep of the mighty seas as they roll it to and fro\r\namong the rocks. Fearful and crafty the smile that darkened the dark face\r\nof the willing murderer who was leading the horse with the false light as\r\nhe heard the crash of the vessel and the shrieks of the drowning crew!\r\nFearful the smile that darkened the faces of the men and women waiting on\r\nthe beach as they came out from their places, ready to struggle and fight\r\namong themselves for any spoil that might come ashore! A homeward-bound\r\nship from the Indies! Great good fortune—rich spoil! Bale after bale is\r\nseized upon by the wreckers, and dragged high upon the beach out of the\r\nway of the surf. But, see! a sailor clinging to a bit of broken mast! With\r\nhis last conscious effort he gains a footing on the shore, staggers\r\nforward, and falls. Is he alive? Not now! Why did that fearful old woman\r\nkneel upon his chest and cover his mouth with her cloak? Dead men tell no\r\ntales—claim no property!”\r\n\r\nAlas! the above is no imaginary or exaggerated statement of facts.\r\n\r\nA few examples, which have occurred for the most part within the last\r\nhundred years or so, are appended. They have been culled from that most\r\nrigidly correct chronicler, the _Annual Register_:—\r\n\r\n_Lent Circuit, 1774._—At Shrewsbury Assizes, bills of indictment were\r\npreferred by Captain Chilcot, late of the _Charming Jenny_, against three\r\nopulent inhabitants of the Isle of Anglesea, one of whom is said to be\r\npossessed of a considerable estate, and to have offered five thousand\r\npounds bail in order to their being tried at the next assizes on a charge\r\nof piracy, when the bills were found. It appeared that on the 11th\r\nSeptember, 1773, in very bad weather, in consequence of false lights being\r\ndiscovered, the captain bore for shore, when his vessel, whose cargo was\r\nvalued at £19,000, went to pieces, and all the crew, except the captain\r\nand his wife, perished, the latter being brought on shore on a portion of\r\nthe wreck. Nearly exhausted, they lay for some time, till the savages of\r\nthe adjacent places rushed down upon them. The lady was just able to lift\r\na handkerchief up to her head when her husband was torn from her side.\r\nThey cut the buckles from his shoes, and deprived him of every covering.\r\nHappy to escape with his life, he hasted to the beach in search of his\r\nwife, when, horrible to relate, her half-naked and plundered corpse\r\npresented itself to his view. What to do Captain Chilcot was at a loss.\r\nProvidence, however, conducted him to the roof of a venerable pair, who\r\nbestowed upon him every assistance. The captain’s wife, it seems, at the\r\ntime the ship went to pieces, had two bank bills of a considerable value\r\nand seventy guineas in her pocket. At the Summer Assizes at Salop, Roberts\r\nand Parry, two of the above-named, were found guilty of plundering the\r\n_Charming Jenny_, but their counsel pleading an arrest of judgment,\r\nsentence was suspended. Eventually one was executed, and one had his\r\nsentence commuted.\r\n\r\nOn the 7th September, 1782, one John Webb was executed at Hereford for\r\nhaving plundered a Venetian vessel drawn on shore on the coast of\r\nGlamorganshire by stress of weather. No mention is made of hurting or\r\nmolesting the crew, and it is evident that the laws were, about this time,\r\nstringently carried out. “This,” said the _Annual Register_, “it is hoped,\r\nwill put a final stop to that inhuman practice of plundering ships wrecked\r\nupon the coast.”\r\n\r\nNext follows an example in the present century:—“_Jany. 8, 1811._—Another\r\ndaring attempt (says the _Register_) was made by a party of country-people\r\nat Clonderalaw Bay to take possession of the American ship _Romulus_ on\r\nthis day. They assembled at about ten in the evening, to the amount of\r\nabout two or three hundred, and commenced a firing of musketry, which they\r\nkept up at intervals for three hours; when, finding a steady resistance\r\nfrom the crew, and guard of yeomanry which had been put on the vessel on\r\nher first going on shore, they retired. The shot they fired appeared to be\r\ncut from square bars of lead, about half an inch in diameter. One of these\r\nmiscreants dropped, and was carried away by his companions.”\r\n\r\nThe following is an extract from a letter:—“On Friday, the 27th of\r\nOctober, 1811, the galliot _Anna Hulk Klas Boyr_, Meinerty master, from\r\nChristian Sound, laden with deals, for Killalu, was driven on shore at a\r\nplace called Porturlin, between Killalu and Broadhaven. The captain and\r\ncrew providentially saved their lives by jumping on shore on a small\r\nisland or rock. At this time the stern and quarter were stove in. The crew\r\nremained two hours on the rock, when they were taken off by a boat and\r\nbrought to the mainland. Shortly after, the captain’s trunk, with all the\r\nsailors’ clothes in general, came on shore, when the country-people\r\nimmediately began to plunder, leaving the unfortunate sufferers nothing\r\nbut what they had on their backs. The plunderers repaired to the wreck,\r\nand cut away everything they could come at of the sails, rigging, &c.,\r\nwhile hundreds were taking away the deals to all parts of the country.\r\nThough the captain spoke good English, and most pitifully inquired to whom\r\nhe might apply for assistance, yet he could not hear of any for fourteen\r\nhours, when he was told that Major Denis Bingham was the nearest and only\r\nperson he could apply to. With much difficulty he procured a guide, and\r\nproceeded to Mr. Bingham’s, a distance of twenty miles through the\r\nmountains. In the meantime, after thirty-six hours’ concealment of this\r\nvery melancholy circumstance, Captain Morris, of the _Townshend_ cruiser,\r\nwho lay at Broadhaven, a distance of about ten miles from the wreck, heard\r\nof it, and, approaching it, landed with twenty men, well armed. In coming\r\nnear the wreck he first fired in the air, in order to disperse the\r\npeasantry, which had no effect; he therefore ordered his men to fire\r\nclose, which had the desired effect, when he immediately pursued them into\r\nthe interior, from three to five miles distance, dividing his party in\r\ndifferent directions, when, by great exertion and fatigue, they saved\r\nabout 1,800 deals and a remnant of the wreck. Captain Morris had some of\r\nthe robbers taken, but his party being so scattered, they were rescued by\r\na large mob of the country. The unfortunate captain and crew were taken by\r\nCaptain Morris on board his cutter, where they got a change of clothing,\r\nand were taken every possible care of.”\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: WRECKERS WAITING FOR A WRECK.]\r\n\r\nThe following particulars of the wreck and plunder of the _Inverness_, in\r\nthe river Shannon, loaded at Limerick with a cargo of provisions, under\r\ncontract for the Victualling Board, and bound to London, will be found\r\ninteresting:—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n         “From Captain Miller to Mr. Spaight, Merchant, Limerick.\r\n                                                  “Kilrush, Feb. 24, 1817.\r\n\r\n“DEAR SPAIGHT,—As I am now in possession of most of the particulars of the\r\nwreck of the _Inverness_, I shall detail them to you as follows:—\r\n\r\n“She went on shore on Wednesday night, the 19th instant, mistaking\r\nRinevaha for Carrigaholt, and would have got off by the next spring-tide\r\nhad the peasantry not boarded her, and rendered her not seaworthy by\r\nscuttling her and tearing away all her rigging; they then robbed the crew\r\nof all their clothes, tore their shirts, which they made bags of to carry\r\naway the plunder, and then broached the tierces of pork, and distributed\r\nthe contents to people on shore, who assisted to convey them up the\r\ncountry. The alarm having reached this on Thursday, a sergeant and twelve\r\nof the police were sent down, with the chief constable at their head, and\r\nthey succeeded in re-taking some of the provisions and securing them,\r\ndriving the mob from the wreck. The police kept possession of what they\r\nhad got during the night; but very early on Friday morning the people\r\ncollected in some thousands, and went down to the beach, where they formed\r\ninto three bodies, and cheered each other with hats off, advancing with\r\nthreats, declaring that they defied the police, and would possess\r\nthemselves again of what had been taken from them, and of the arms of the\r\npolice. The police formed into one body, and, showing three fronts,\r\nendeavoured to keep them at bay, but in vain; they assailed them with\r\nstones, sticks, scythes, and axes, and gave some of our men some severe\r\nblows, which exasperated them so much that they were under the necessity\r\nof firing in self-defence, and four of the assailants fell victims, two of\r\nwhom were buried yesterday. During their skirmishing, which began about\r\nseven o’clock, one of the men, mounted, was despatched to this town for a\r\nreinforcement, when Major Warburton, in half an hour, with twenty cavalry,\r\nand a few infantry mounted behind them, left this, and in one hour and a\r\nhalf were on board the wreck, and took twelve men in the act of cutting up\r\nthe wreck. One of them made a blow of a hatchet at Major Warburton, which\r\nhe warded off, and snapped a pistol at him; the fellow immediately threw\r\nhimself overboard, when —— Troy charged him on horseback, up to the\r\nhorse’s knees in water, and cut him down. The fellows then flew in every\r\ndirection, pursued by our men, who took many of them, and wounded several.\r\nNine tierces of pork had been saved. Her bowsprit, gaff, and spars are all\r\ngone, with every stitch of canvas and all the running rigging. The shrouds\r\nare still left; two anchors and their cables are gone, and even the ship’s\r\npump. A more complete plunder has seldom been witnessed. Yesterday the\r\nrevenue wherry went down to Rinevaha, and returned in the evening with the\r\nMajor and a small party, with thirty-five prisoners, who now are all\r\nlodged in Bridewell. The women in multitudes assembled to supply the men\r\nwith whisky to encourage them. Nothing could exceed the coolness of ——\r\nBalfice and his party, who certainly made a masterly retreat to the slated\r\nstore at Carrigaholt, where I found them. He and Fitzgerald were wounded,\r\nbut not severely. Fitzgerald had a miraculous escape, and would have been\r\nmurdered, but was preserved by a man he knew from Kerry, who put him under\r\nhis bed.\r\n\r\n                                                              “J. MILLER.“\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: MAJOR WARBURTON AT THE WRECK OF THE “INVERNESS.”]\r\n\r\nA late case of plundering on a large scale occurred the 26th September,\r\n1817. The Norwegian brig _Bergetta_, Captain Peterson, was wrecked on the\r\nCefu-Sidau sands, in Carmarthen Bay. She was bound from Barcelona for\r\nStettin, with a cargo of wine, spirits, &c., when the master, losing his\r\nreckoning, owing to a thick fog, fell into the fatal error of taking the\r\ncoast of Devon for that of France, and acted under that persuasion. So\r\ncircumstanced, a violent gale, together with the tide, drove the vessel\r\ninto the Bristol Channel, and she struck upon the above sands, and in the\r\nspace of two or three hours went to pieces. The master and crew, with\r\ngreat difficulty, got into the boat, and were all happily saved.\r\nNotwithstanding the greatest exertions on the part of the officers of the\r\nCustoms, supported by several gentlemen and others, acts of plunder were\r\ncommitted to a considerable extent. Of 266 pipes and casks of wine, &c.,\r\nnot above 100 were saved. Hundreds of men and women were reduced to nearly\r\na state of insensibility through intoxication.\r\n\r\n                     [Illustration: A WRECK ASHORE.]\r\n\r\nA scarce and curious tract, published in 1796, exists in the library of\r\nthe British Museum, and a few extracts from it will show the arguments by\r\nwhich the wreckers of the last century salved their consciences. It is\r\nsupposed to be a dialogue between one Richard Sparkes, a chandler by\r\ntrade, but a professional wrecker also, and John Trueman, “an honest\r\ntaylor.”\r\n\r\n“‘Good news! good news, neighbour!’ said Richard Sparkes, the chandler, as\r\nhe entered a shop where John Trueman, an honest taylor, was at work. ‘The\r\nvessel which has been these three hours fighting with the surge and winds\r\nfor the harbour has at last bulged. It is a trader from Amsterdam, they\r\nsay, and faith! two thumping casks were floating before I left the beach.\r\nRare sport, Master Trueman, rare sport, let me tell you! A good blustering\r\nwind and a high surf is no bad thing for a seaport.’\r\n\r\n“Honest Trueman, who had not been long an inhabitant of the place, and was\r\nquite unacquainted with this language—which, to the disgrace of humanity,\r\nis too often used by the unfeeling on such occasions in seaport\r\ntowns—suspended his work, and listened to this harangue with too much\r\nsurprise to interrupt it. At length, said he, ‘Do you call this rare\r\nsport? Do you call this good news?’\r\n\r\n“SPARKES. ‘To be sure I do. I mean to be out all night; the tide will\r\nreturn in about three hours, and I warrant it will bring us something\r\nworth looking after. But mayhap, as you are a new-comer, Master Trueman,\r\nyou do not know the go at these seasons, so I will tell you. You must know\r\nthat when a vessel strikes it is catch as catch can for her lading: one\r\nhas as good a right as another, and he is the luckiest who can get most.\r\nWe call it _going a wrecking_; and let me tell you it is no bad business.\r\nThere is my neighbour Perkins, the pilot, got the Lord knows what by the\r\nsmuggling cutter that was wrecked about three leagues from hence two\r\nmonths ago. Ay, cask upon cask of the best French brandy, and tea, and I\r\ncannot tell you what he got; but he has held his head pretty high ever\r\nsince, for, as good luck would have it, she struck upon a shoal of rock\r\nwhere the Custom-house officers would not venture, so Perkins and a few\r\nmore knowing ones had it all to themselves. As I told you before, Master\r\nTrueman, this _going a wrecking_ is no bad business, so look about you.’”\r\n\r\nTrueman upbraids the first speaker with dishonesty and want of humanity.\r\n\r\n“‘Humanity,’ says Sparkes, ‘odds my life! neighbour, there’s not a more\r\ntenderhearted fellow alive. Many is the life my boat, when I was in the\r\nfishing trade, has saved from pure good-will; but as to the matter of the\r\n_wrecking_, every man must take care of his own interest. Charity, you\r\nknow, Master Trueman, should begin at home.’” And he goes on to say that\r\nit was no fault of his that the vessel bulged, or that the master or\r\ncabin-boy were drowned; that it is all the chance of war, and that one\r\nvessel was the same to him as another, provided it were well laden. He\r\nadded that he did not pretend to be better than his grandfather, and that\r\nwrecking was in fashion in his days and in those of his good old father\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\nMr. D. Mackinnen, who made a tour through the West Indies early in the\r\npresent century, particularly mentions the Bahamas as the home of\r\nwreckers. He says that the immense variety of banks, shallows, and unknown\r\npassages between the hundreds of islands which form the group render the\r\nchances of shipwreck frequent. In order to save the crews and property so\r\nconstantly exposed to danger, the Governor of the Bahamas, about the\r\ncommencement of this century, licensed a number of daring adventurers to\r\nply up and down and assist ships in peril, and there could not have been\r\ncollected a more skilful and hardy set of men. But, unfortunately, the\r\ngovernor’s good intentions were baulked by the larger part of them\r\nbecoming wreckers. Mr. Mackinnen asking one of these men what success he\r\nhad lately had, was told that there had been about forty sail of pilots\r\nalong the Florida coast for four months. He remarked that they must have\r\nrendered great service to the crews wrecked in that dangerous passage. The\r\npilot said, “No; they generally _went on_ in the night.” “But could not\r\nyou light up beacons on shore?” “No, no,” said the man, laughing, “we\r\nalways put them out for a better chance by night.” “But it would have been\r\nmore humane——” “I did not go there for humanity; I went _racking_!”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                        “HOVELLING” _v._ WRECKING.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The Contrast—The “Hovellers” defended—Their Services—The Case of\r\n    the _Albion_—Anchors and Cables wanted by a disabled Vessel—Lugger\r\n    wrecked on the Beach—Dangers of the Hoveller’s Life—Nearly swamped\r\n     by the heavy Seas—Loss of a baling Bowl, and what it means—Saved\r\n        on an American Ship—The Lost Found—A brilliant example of\r\n       Life-saving at Bideford—The Small Rewards of the Hoveller’s\r\n    Life—The case of _La Marguerite_—Nearly wrecked in Port—Hovellers\r\n        _v._ Wreckers—“Let’s all start fair!”—Praying for Wrecks.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe wrecker was a land-ghoul, a monster in human form, who preyed on human\r\nlife and property. The “hovellers,” a distinctive term on many parts of\r\nthe coasts of this sea-girt isle, is applied to the hardy men who, in all\r\nweathers and at all risks, go to the assistance of ships in distress, and\r\noccasionally benefit by a wreck, but they are not wreckers. The Rev. Mr.\r\nGilmore, who has so well described the dangers, perils, and triumphs of\r\nthe life-boat service, very properly includes among the storm warriors the\r\nhonest men who perform these practical deeds of naval daring. Visitors to\r\nRamsgate and other seaside resorts of the southern coast will remember the\r\nluggers in which holiday excursions are made; many of these same boats\r\nare, in winter more especially, engaged in very serious work. “The more\r\nthreatening and heavy the weather,” says our authority, “the greater the\r\nprobability of disaster occurring or having occurred, then the more ready\r\nare the crew to work their way out to the Goodwin Sands, and to cruise\r\nround them on the look-out for vessels in distress; they dare not take the\r\nlugger into the broken water—there a life-boat alone can live: but still,\r\nshe is a grand sea-boat, one that will stagger on, with a ship’s heavy\r\nanchor and chain on board, through weather bad enough for anything—a boat\r\nthat is well suited for the hard and dangerous service which employs her\r\nduring the winter months.” The hovelling lugger has generally a crew of\r\nten men, and these receive no regular pay. Any salvage or reward the\r\nvessel earns is commonly divided into fourteen shares; the boat takes\r\nthree and a half for the owners, half a share goes for the provisions, and\r\neach man of the crew receives one share. Mr. Gilmore says that “complaints\r\nare sometimes made of the amounts charged by these men for services\r\nrendered; but the cases of a good hovel are few and far between; and often\r\nthe luggers put out to sea night after night throughout a stormy winter,\r\nhanging about the sands, in wind and rain, and snow and mists, the men\r\nhalf-frozen with the cold and half-smothered with the flying surf and\r\nspray, and often week after week they thus suffer and endure, and do not\r\nmake a penny-piece each man; then at last, perhaps, comes a chance: a big\r\nship is on the tail of a sandbank; they render assistance and get her off;\r\nthey have saved thousands of pounds worth of property; and the captain,\r\nand the owners, and the underwriters all look aghast, and cry out with\r\nindignation when they ask perhaps a sum that will give them ten or fifteen\r\npounds a man.”\r\n\r\nNot uncommonly the lugger speaks a vessel, and finds that an anchor or\r\nanchors, cables, &c., have been lost, and must be replaced. They must make\r\nin all haste for shore, and obtain what is needed, and put out again to\r\nthe distressed vessel. What all this may mean on occasions to the owners\r\nand men of the hovelling vessels is shown in the following example—the\r\ncase of the _Albion_ lugger.\r\n\r\nThe _Albion_ meets a vessel driving before the gale, having lost both her\r\nanchors and cables; receives orders to supply her from shore; and the\r\nhardy crew, putting the vessel round, beat through the heavy seas, and\r\nmake for Deal. “They have to force the boat against wind and tide, and\r\nmuch skill is required to prevent her being filled by the rising seas\r\nwhich sweep around her; now she rushes upon the beach, the surf breaks\r\nover her and half fills her with water; with a tremendous thump and shake\r\nshe strikes the shore with her iron keel.\r\n\r\n“As the wave which bore the lugger in upon the beach recedes, a man\r\nsprings overboard from the bow with a rope in his hand; many catch hold of\r\nthe rope, and haul their hardest to keep the boat straight, head on to the\r\nbeach; there is a stem strap—a chain running through a hole in the front\r\npart of the keel; a boatman watches his opportunity, and, as a wave sweeps\r\nback, rushes down and passes a rope through the loop of the strap; the\r\nother end of this rope is fastened to a powerful capstan, which is placed\r\nhigh up on the beach. ‘Man the capstan! Heave with a will!’ and the strong\r\nmen strain at the capstan bars until the capstan creaks again. There is no\r\nstarting the lugger: she is so full of water from the surf breaking on the\r\nbeach that she is too heavy for the men at one capstan to move her; ropes\r\nare led down from two other capstans, and rove through a snatch-block\r\nfastened to a boat on the beach; all put out their strength, round they\r\ntramp, with a ‘Ho! heave ho!’ and slowly the lugger travels up the beach,\r\nand is safe from the roll of the breakers. The men get the water out of\r\nher, haul her higher up on to a swivel platform, turn her round head to\r\nthe sea, and the leading hands hurry away to inquire about an anchor and\r\ncable. The agent supplies them with such as seem suitable for the size of\r\nthe vessel, and which will perhaps weigh together about seven tons.” Then\r\nfollows the labour of getting them on board, but in a short time all are\r\nready for sea.\r\n\r\n“The gale has rapidly increased in force, and a frightful surf is running\r\non the beach; the roar of the breakers on the shingle, the howling of the\r\nstorm, the gleam of white foam shining out of the mist and gloom, all\r\npicture the wildness of the storm; but the undaunted boatmen do not\r\nhesitate. All is ready; the signal given; the boat rushes down the steep\r\nways, and is launched into the sea. A breaking wave rolls in swiftly, it\r\nmeets the bow of the lugger in its rush, fills her; for a moment the big\r\nboat runs under water, and then is lifted and twisted like a toy in the\r\ngrasp of the sea, and is thrown, in the heave of the wave, broadside on to\r\nthe beach; a cry of horror from all on shore, and a rush down to aid the\r\ncrew, who are all—there are fifteen of them—struggling in the surf: now\r\nthe men are washed up by the wave, and feel the ground and stagger\r\nforward; now they are caught again by a breaker and rolled over; it is for\r\neach of them a terrible battle with the fierce seas; here one gets on his\r\nfeet and stumbles forward, he is caught by the men on shore and dragged up\r\nthe beach; there a man is lying struggling on the shingle, trying in vain\r\nto rise, exhausted and confused, two men seize his collar, and pull him\r\nforward a yard or two, then get him to his feet, and he escapes the next\r\nwave, which would have washed him out to sea again. Now all the men seem\r\nto be saved; names are shouted—do all answer? No; there is one missing!\r\nAll rush to the water’s edge and gaze into the darkness, eagerly watching\r\neach shadow mid the surf. ‘There he is! No! Yes it is! there—lifting on\r\nthe surf! there, rolling-over!’ ‘Quick! quick! form a line!’ And the brave\r\nboatmen grasp each other’s hands with iron strength, and form a chain, the\r\nlowest of the four or five men at the sea end of the chain being in the\r\nwater. The waves battle with them, but sturdily they persevere. At last\r\nthe body is within reach of the seaward man; he grasps it; the men are\r\ndragged up the beach, and the poor insensible man is carried ashore. Alive\r\nor dead? They cannot say; and with a great fear in their hearts they carry\r\nhim hurriedly up the beach, and soon, to the great joy of all, he gives\r\nsigns of life, and gradually recovers.\r\n\r\n“In the meanwhile, the poor boatmen on the beach have nothing that they\r\ncan do but watch their fine boat, which was worth five hundred pounds,\r\nbeing torn and hammered to pieces in the surf. Plank after plank is\r\nwrenched from her. Now, with a loud crash, she is broken in half; the two\r\nhalves part; the anchor and cable fall through her. They can see part of\r\nthe forepeak, with one side torn away, floating in the breakers; soon that\r\nalso is rent to pieces, and nothing but fragments of the boat float in the\r\nsurf or are strewn about the beach; and the boatmen, heavy-hearted, but\r\nthankful that they have escaped with their lives, go slowly to their homes\r\nto rest for a few hours and recruit their strength, and then be ready to\r\nform part of the crew of any other boat, and at the first summons to rush\r\nout again to the encounter with the stormiest seas.” And that what the men\r\nof Deal are _par excellence_—hardy, brave, and skilful—the men of our\r\ncoasts are very generally.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: LOSS OF THE “ALBION” LUGGER.]\r\n\r\nSometimes the hovellers are distinctly associated with the life-boat men\r\nin their efforts to save life. Gilmore cites a case where a lugger’s boat\r\nhad succeeded in taking a number of men off a wreck, when they themselves\r\nwere caught in a squall, and were only too glad to make for the life-boat,\r\nto which the larger part were transferred. Then came a chapter of\r\ndifficulties, for neither steamer nor lugger could be discovered through\r\nthe fog, which obscured everything within a few yards of them. When they\r\nat length reached the _Champion_ lugger, the shipwrecked crew refused to\r\nleave the life-boat. They had been as nearly as possible wrecked a second\r\ntime in the lugger’s boat. What a story had these poor men to relate!\r\n\r\nTheir vessel, the _Effort_, had been beaten about for days in the North\r\nSea previous to grounding on the fatal Goodwins. They hoisted lamps, and\r\nwere preparing to set a tar-barrel on fire, when their ship, which was\r\nvery light, rolled from side to side, almost yard-arms under, and then\r\nsuddenly capsized altogether. “At once,” said one of the narrators, “and\r\nwith difficulty, we made for the weather rigging, and were glad to find\r\nthat not any of the crew were lost as she fell over. We lashed ourselves\r\nto the rigging. We knew, to our great joy, that the tide was falling; had\r\nit been rising, we must have very soon been overrun by it, the vessel\r\nbroken up, and every man of us lost. We were in danger enough as it was,\r\nfor the brig, soon after she capsized, was caught by the tide, and worked\r\nround, with her deck towards the seas; and as the heavy seas broke over\r\nand came rushing up the deck, they fell on us with terrible weight, and\r\nbeat us and crushed us against the ship’s rail, so that we were forced to\r\nunlash ourselves from the rigging; and what to do we did not know, till\r\none of us said, ‘Our only chance is to lash the end of the ropes round our\r\nwaists, and let go the rigging as the waves come.’ And so we did; and\r\nterrible work it was. As the waves came we slackened the ropes and went\r\naway a little with them; and as they passed, half smothered as we were,\r\nhauled ourselves back to the rigging and held on a bit; and then, when the\r\nnext wave came, we let go, and were all adrift in the wash again; our\r\nhands were almost torn to pieces with the strain on the ropes and grasping\r\nat the side of the vessel.... You see, too, how our clothes were nearly\r\ndragged off us: it was indeed an awful time!” One man grew terribly\r\nexcited as they told the dismal story. His limbs and features worked, and\r\nas the waves dashed over the life-boat he fancied himself being washed off\r\nthe wreck, and his reason quite gave way for the time. He shouted out,\r\n“Let me drown myself! Let me drown myself! I can stand it no longer!” and\r\nwas with the greatest difficulty held back by three men, who would not\r\nrelinquish their hold till they got safe into harbour.\r\n\r\nThe hoveller’s life is necessarily full of danger, for his services are\r\nusually only required in the very worst weather; and if he can save\r\nanything from a wreck, it will generally be done under circumstances of\r\ngreat difficulty. Gilmore cites an example where some of these men were\r\nendeavouring to save the rigging of a wrecked vessel, when a squall came\r\non, with driving snow and hail. The men in the rigging were somewhat\r\ninterested in their work, and were at first inclined to risk the weather,\r\nbut the gale increased so rapidly that it became evident that they must\r\nleave in their boat at once. Away for their lives the men pull, the little\r\nboat seethes through the troubled waters, and they soon near the edge of\r\nthe sand, and are making for deep water, when they suddenly hear the noise\r\nof the surf beating on the shallows immediately ahead of them. They pull\r\nahead a little, and can see the huge waves rolling in out of the deep\r\nwater, mounting up, curling over, and breaking, meeting other breakers,\r\nfoaming up against them—in fact, a sea of raging waters surrounding the\r\nsands in which their little boat would be swamped at once. As they mount\r\non a wave they can see the lugger riding safely just outside the surf,\r\nonly a quarter of a mile off, but that quarter of a mile it is impossible\r\nfor them to pass, and equally impossible for the lugger to get any nearer\r\nto them. The seas break over them constantly, and for a while they return\r\nto the dangerous shelter of the wreck.\r\n\r\n   [Illustration: MAP SHOWING COAST OF RAMSGATE AND THE GOODWIN SANDS.]\r\n\r\n“The Goodwin Sands are about nine miles long; in the middle of them there\r\nis, at low water, a large lake, which is called on the chart ‘Trinity\r\nBay,’ but which is known to the boatmen as the ‘In-Sand.’ The men row in\r\nthe direction of the lake, and row over the sandbanks which surround it,\r\nas soon as the tide has flowed sufficiently to enable them to do so. Now\r\nthey find themselves in completely smooth water, and are safe; but for how\r\nlong? a short hour or so, for the hungry waves are following them up fast.\r\nStill higher and higher comes the tide, and a furious surf begins to rage\r\nover the banks that for a time protect the lake.” Well do the men know how\r\nshort must be their period of rest.\r\n\r\nSoon the heavy rollers come in and threaten to swamp them; the boat is\r\nnearly full of water. At this juncture the steersman, who has been\r\nsteering and baling the boat for about four hours, suddenly lets the bowl\r\nwith which he is baling fly from his hand; he gives a cry of horror, and\r\nthe men cannot help repeating it, for may not this apparently small\r\naccident be fatal to them? To keep the boat afloat without baling is\r\nimpossible; the surf breaks into her continually, and that bowl is\r\nindispensable to their safety, for the men cannot use their sou’westers\r\nfor the purpose when both hands are so busily employed in freeing their\r\noars from the seas and keeping the blades from being blown up into the air\r\nby the force of the gale. Most happily, the bowl is a wooden one, and it\r\nfloats a few yards from them. The men watch it anxiously as they are\r\ntossed up and down by the quick waves. Back the boat down upon the bowl\r\nthey cannot, and it is drifting away faster than they are floating. It\r\nwould seem a simple matter to pick up a bowl floating within a distance so\r\nsmall, but the waves long render it impossible. Suddenly the coxswain\r\ncries, “Here is a lull; round with her sharp!” The men on the starboard\r\nside give a mighty pull, and the others back their hardest; then a pull\r\naltogether; the bowl is within reach; the coxswain grasps it with a hasty\r\nsnatch. “Round! round with her quick!” and the boat is got head straight\r\nto the seas again before the waves can catch her broadside and roll her\r\nover. All breathe again: they have another chance of life.\r\n\r\nThey get clear of the Sands, but a fierce gale is still raging. “As they\r\nget into the Gull stream, they see vessel after vessel running with\r\nclose-reefed topsails before the gale; the boatmen hail them, but they get\r\nno answer. One little sloop affords them slight hope, for she is evidently\r\naltering her course, but after a moment’s apparent hesitation, away she\r\ngoes again before the gale, and abandons them to their fate. The captain\r\nof the little vessel related afterwards how, in the height of the storm,\r\nhe saw some poor fellows in a small boat, and had a great wish to try and\r\nsave them, but the sea was running so high that he felt it was impossible\r\nto heave his vessel to, and so had to leave them, and that they must have\r\nbeen driven on the Sands and lost. This sloop was about a quarter of a\r\nmile from the boat, and the men do not again get as near to any other\r\nship; and as vessel after vessel passes, and the night begins to grow\r\ndark, the position of the men becomes more and more hopeless, and they all\r\nfeel that if no vessel picks them up they must soon be blown in again upon\r\nthe sands, and there perish.” The men work on, but solemnly, very\r\nsolemnly.\r\n\r\nBut one vessel, a large American ship, remains at anchor in the Downs;\r\nvessel after vessel had slipped their cables and run before the gale. It\r\nis their last hope. “As they drop slowly towards her, they shout time\r\nafter time, but cannot make themselves heard, and it is getting too dusk\r\nfor them to be seen at any distance; the seas are running alongside the\r\nship almost gunwale high, and it is impossible to get nearer to her than\r\nwithin fifty yards. Hail after hail the men give; still they get no\r\nanswer. They can see a man on the poop, but he evidently neither sees nor\r\nhears them, and their last chance seems slipping away, for they are fast\r\ndrifting past the vessel. ‘Get on the thwart, Dick, and shout with all\r\nyour might!’ the coxswain says to the man pulling stroke oar. ‘I’ll hold\r\nyou!’ hauling in his oar and catching it under the seat. The man springs\r\nupon the thwart, and balancing himself for a second, hails with all his\r\nforce.”\r\n\r\n“The man is moving; he hears us, hurrah!” is the glad cry in the boat; and\r\nthey can soon see several astonished faces peering over them. The boat\r\ndrifts by the ship; they give a pull or two, to get her under the stern of\r\nthe vessel; a coil of rope with a life-buoy is thrown to them, and they\r\nmanage to get it on board. The captain is now on deck; he orders other\r\nropes to be sent down, and soon another life-buoy, with cord attached,\r\ncomes floating by. Still the boat is in great danger; their safety\r\nhitherto has been in floating with the waves, yielding to them as they\r\nrolled on, but now the little boat has to breast the waves, and is tossed\r\nhigh in the air, and again plunged far down, running great risk of being\r\noverturned. “The difficulty now is how to get the men out of the boat, for\r\nthey dare not haul her up closer to the vessel, as she will not ride with\r\na shorter scope of rope. They send another rope down to the boat, with a\r\nbowline knot made in it, for the men to sit in, and then shout to the men,\r\n‘We will haul you on board one at a time!’” A moment’s question as to the\r\norder in which the men shall go is quickly decided, for each feels that at\r\nany moment the boat may sink or upset. They leave in the order in which\r\nthey sit, and one after another they plunge into the waves, and are hauled\r\non board, dripping, but saved! Very soon the boat fills and turns over,\r\nand hangs by the ropes till morning.\r\n\r\nThe captain will hardly credit their story at first. “Impossible!\r\nimpossible!” says he. “No boat could live in such a sea, and over the\r\nSands. Impossible!” But he becomes convinced at last, and all on board\r\nshow every attention and kindness. A little brandy and some dry clothes at\r\nonce, a beefsteak supper and a glass of grog later on, followed by warm\r\nbeds made up on the captain’s cabin floor, and their adventures in an open\r\nboat were but the memory of a horrid dream. The coxswain, however, fell\r\nvery ill soon after, and was nigh death’s door; he did not recover his\r\nstrength for a twelvemonth, so greatly had the anxiety of that night’s\r\nwork told upon him.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the lugger, after cruising backwards and forwards, the crew\r\nkeeping an anxious and fruitless look-out for their comrades in the boat,\r\nis obliged to put in for Dover, from whence they telegraph the sad news\r\nthat six of their men are to all appearance lost. Next morning they make\r\none more effort to find some traces of their lost companions, and then\r\nsteer, sad and disheartened, for Ramsgate. There the arrival of the lugger\r\nis most anxiously awaited. Alas! it is as they feared, and many a\r\nhousehold is plunged in grief. While this is going on, the boatmen leave\r\nthe American ship and row steadily for Ramsgate, near which they fall in\r\nwith another lugger, on which they are taken. The lugger’s flag is\r\nhoisted, in token that they are the bearers of good news, and great is the\r\ncuriosity of the men about the harbour. A crowd hurries down the pier to\r\nwatch her arrival, and as soon as the men missing from the _Princess\r\nAlice_ are recognised, the cheers and excitement are wild in the extreme.\r\nMen rush off to bear the good news. “One poor woman, in the midst of her\r\nagony and mourning for her husband, and surrounded by her weeping friends,\r\nis surprised by her door being burst violently open, and at seeing a\r\nboatman, almost dropping with breathlessness, gasping and gesticulating\r\nand nodding, but trying in vain to speak; and it is some seconds before he\r\ncan stammer out, ‘All right! all right! Your husband is safe—coming now!’”\r\n\r\n          [Illustration: THE LUGGER REACHING RAMSGATE HARBOUR.]\r\n\r\nThe danger incurred by the hovellers is well illustrated by the following\r\nexample, recorded by our leading journal(76) some years since. Nine of\r\nthese men endeavoured to save a sloop, the _Wool-packet_, of Dartmouth,\r\nstranded on Bideford Bar, and the crew must have lost their lives but for\r\nthe noble service performed, under great risks, by Captain Thomas Jones,\r\nmaster of the steam-tug _Ely_, of Cardiff. A shipowner of Bideford, who\r\nwas an eye-witness of the brave deed, stated that the crew of the vessel\r\nhad abandoned her, and the two boats’ crews, consisting of nine men,\r\nafterwards boarded the wreck, with the view of trying to get her off the\r\nbar; but when the tide rose the sea broke heavily over the vessel, and the\r\nmen hoisted a flag of distress. The steam-tug _Ely_ now hastened to the\r\nrescue, against a strong tide and wind. Before, however, she could get\r\nnear the wreck, the nine men were driven to seek refuge in the rigging.\r\nThe sea was breaking fearfully in all directions and the vessel rolling\r\nfrom side to side, but Captain Jones and his crew bravely proceeded\r\nthrough the broken water, at the risk of their lives and vessel, and\r\nsucceeded, at the first attempt, in saving three of the men. This was all\r\nthat they could then accomplish, for the sea was now breaking so furiously\r\nover the wreck that the steamer was driven away; and the same want of\r\nsuccess attended a second and third attempt to approach the wreck. The\r\ncaptain then backed astern, and, with consummate skill and boldness,\r\nactually placed the steamer alongside the vessel’s rigging, with her bow\r\nover the deck of the wreck, thus saving the six men in the rigging; and\r\nwithin the short space of two minutes the wreck had actually disappeared,\r\nand was not seen afterwards. But for this bold and successful service,\r\nnine widows (for the nine rescued men were all married) and forty\r\nfatherless children would to-day be lamenting the loss of husbands and\r\nfathers. The National Life-boat Institution presented a medal, &c., to the\r\ncaptain, and £1 each to the eight men forming the crew.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: WRECK OF THE “WOOL-PACKET” ON BIDEFORD BAR.]\r\n\r\nThe greatness of the risk to the hoveller, and the comparative smallness\r\nof his reward, are illustrated in the case of _La Marguerite_, a small\r\nFrench brig, rescued from the Goodwin Sands and brought safely into\r\nRamsgate Harbour. She was owned by her captain, and represented to him the\r\nlabours of a hardworking life. She was bound from Christiania to Dieppe,\r\nwith a cargo of deals, and was considerably hampered on deck, the timber\r\nbeing piled up almost to her gunwale. She lost her course in the night,\r\nand grounded on the Sands. “Where are they? Where can they be? What\r\nhorrible mistake have they made?” writes Mr. Gilmore in his forcible\r\nmanner. “They think they must have run somewhere on the mainland on the\r\nKent coast; one man proposes to swim ashore with a rope, but the seas come\r\nsweeping over them with a degree of violence that quite does away with any\r\nthought of making such an attempt. They hurry to the long-boat, to try and\r\nget it out, but it and the only other boat which is in the brig are\r\nspeedily swept overboard by the seas. The vessel is on the edge of the\r\nSands, and feels all the force of the waves as they roll in and leap and\r\nbreak upon the bark. With every inrush of the seas she lifts high, and\r\npitches, crushing her bow down upon the Sands, each time with a thump that\r\nmakes her timbers groan, and almost sends the men flying from the deck.”\r\nFor some twenty minutes she keeps thrashing on the Sands, when they glide\r\noff into deep water, and after much delay get their anchor overboard. The\r\ngale continues, and, after much entreaty—for the captain is a poor man—the\r\ncrew succeed in inducing him to cut the foremast away, and the brig rides\r\nmore easily when this is accomplished. They wait for daylight. They are\r\nthen seen from Margate, and two fine luggers have a race to see which can\r\nget first to the vessel. The life-boat also puts off. One of the luggers\r\ngets alongside in fine shape, and the men at once recommend the captain to\r\ncut away the remaining mast, but he will not be persuaded. They raise the\r\nanchor, and passing a hawser on board, attempt to tow the brig from the\r\nSands, but make little progress. To their satisfaction, they see the\r\nRamsgate steam-boat and life-boat making their way round the North\r\nForeland.\r\n\r\n“The coastguard officer at Margate, when he saw that the Margate life-boat\r\ncould not reach the brig, and knowing that if any sea got up where the\r\nvessel was that the luggers could be of no use, telegraphed to Ramsgate\r\nthat the vessel was on the Knock Sands. The steamer and life-boat get\r\nunder weigh at once, and proceed as fast as possible to the rescue. There\r\nis a nasty sea running off Ramsgate, but it is not until they get to the\r\nNorth Foreland that they feel the full force of the gale. Here the sea is\r\ntremendous, and as the steamer pitches to it the waves that break upon her\r\nbows fly right over her funnel—indeed, she buries herself so much in the\r\nseas that they have to ease her speed considerably to prevent her being\r\ncompletely overrun with them.” The boatmen at last get on board the brig;\r\na glance shows that no time must be lost, and as rapidly as possible the\r\nsteamer is enabled to take the water-logged vessel in tow. The French crew\r\nare utterly exhausted with fatigue and excitement, and are quite ready to\r\nleave their vessel in English hands. Away the brig goes, plunging and\r\nrolling, with the seas washing over her decks, which are scarcely out of\r\nthe water, while the two boats are tossing astern, all being towed by the\r\ngallant little steamer. They have nearly reached the harbour.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the rough cold night, the interest in life-boat work is too\r\ngreat for all sympathisers to be driven away from the pier-head; and there\r\nis a crowd there ready to watch the boats return and to welcome the men\r\nwith a cheer. The steamer approaches cautiously, and the brig seems well\r\nunder command. A couple of minutes more and all will be safe, when\r\nsuddenly the rush of tide catches the wreck on the bow; she overpowers the\r\nlugger, which is towing astern; round her head flies; she lurches heavily\r\nforward, and strikes the east pier-head. Crash goes her jib-boom first,\r\nand the steamer, towing with all its might, cannot prevent her again and\r\nagain crushing against the pier. Her bowsprit and figure-head are broken\r\nand torn off, her stern smashed in. Ropes and buoys are thrown from the\r\npier. “The poor Frenchmen are almost paralysed by the scene and by\r\nexcitement—they cannot make it out; the harbour-master, Captain Braine,\r\nhas enough to do: he sees the danger of the men on board the brig, but he\r\nsees more than this—he sees the danger of the crowd at the pier-head, for\r\nthe brig’s mainmast is swaying backwards and forwards, coming right over\r\nthe pier as the vessel rolls, and threatens to break and come down upon\r\nthe people as the brig strikes the pier; and if it does it will certainly\r\nkill some, perhaps many.” Women shriek and men shout, and it looks as\r\nthough the _Marguerite_ would be wrecked in sight of all. Meantime the\r\ncrew of the hovelling lugger are in equal, if not greater, danger.\r\n\r\n“As soon as the men on board the lugger saw the brig sweep and crash\r\nagainst the pier, they cast off their tow-rope, but before they could\r\nhoist any sail, the way they had on the boat and the rush of the tide\r\ncarried the lugger almost between the vessel, as she swung round, and the\r\npier. The men, however, escaped that danger, and indeed death, but the\r\nboat was swept to the back of the pier, and in the eddy of the tide was\r\ncarried into the broken waters; then she rolls in the trough of the sea;\r\nwave after wave catches and sweeps her up towards the pier, as if to crush\r\nher against it, but each time the rebound of the water from the pier acts\r\nas a fender and saves her from destruction; but she is an open boat, and\r\nif one big wave leaps on board it will fill her, and she must sink at\r\nonce; and the seas around her are very wild, the surf from their crests\r\nbreaks into her continually. The people on the pier see her extreme peril;\r\nsome run to the life-boat men, who are preparing to moor the boat, and\r\nshout to them to hasten out—that the brig is breaking up, and that the\r\nlugger will be swamped; before, however, the life-boat can get out the\r\nbrig is towed clear of the pier, and, the lugger having drifted to the end\r\nof the pier, the men are able to get up a corner of the foresail; it cants\r\nthe lugger’s head round; the men get the foresail well up: it fills; she\r\ndraws away from the pier and away from the broken water, and is clear.”\r\nBut now the brig, the rudder of which had been wrenched out of her on the\r\nSands, has no boat to help her steer, and lurches about in all directions.\r\nA heavy sea strikes her bow; the steamer’s hawser tightens, strains, and\r\nbreaks! Excited people on the pier crowd round the harbour-master, and beg\r\nhim to order the life-boat men to take the crew and the boatmen off the\r\nwreck at once. That official knows, however, the boatmen too well: _they_\r\nwill not leave her while a stitch holds together.\r\n\r\nThe captain of the steamer knows their peril, and backs his vessel down to\r\nthe wreck, now not over a hundred yards from the Dyke Sand. She is rolling\r\nheavily, and the seas sweep over her; her crew can hardly keep the deck.\r\nThe steamer gets close to the brig, and soon another cable is out. Each\r\ntime the brig sheers heavily to one side or the other she is brought up\r\nwith a jerk that makes the steamer tremble from stem to stern, but that\r\nplucky little boat is not to be beaten. Five brave fellows come off from\r\nthe pier in a small boat, bringing a line with them: with this they haul a\r\nsecond hawser to the wreck; a crowd of people on the pier pull their\r\nhardest, and succeed in moving the wreck. This cable breaks shortly\r\nafterwards, but the steamer has by this time again got hold of the vessel,\r\nand tows her safely into the harbour, a miserable wreck, with masts and\r\nrudder gone, her bow and stern crushed, but with everybody safe on board.\r\nThe _Marguerite_ was ultimately repaired and sent to sea again, though she\r\ncould never be the vessel she once was. And the Margate and Ramsgate men\r\ngot a few pounds each for work that required each one to be a hero, and a\r\nvery practical and seamanlike hero too. The old wreckers made ten times\r\nthe money, with an infinitesimal proportion of the trouble.\r\n\r\nYes, times _have_ changed for the better. Individuals may, of course, be\r\nfound capable of any amount of brutality for the sake of gain, but the\r\nshipwrecked mariner of to-day is morally certain that his life and\r\nremaining property are safe when he reaches the shore of any part of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, and that for every ruffian there will be twenty kindly and\r\nhospitable people ready to pity and to aid him. The same could not be said\r\nof the early part of this very century. It seems almost incredible, too\r\nhorrible, to be possible, that in 1811 the remnant of a poor crew of a\r\nfrigate wrecked on the Scotch coast were, after buffeting the breakers and\r\nstruggling ashore for dear life, absolutely murdered on the beach for the\r\nsake of their wretched clothes, or, at all events, stripped and left to\r\ndie. When morning dawned the beach was found strewn with naked corpses.\r\nThe inhabitants of many fishing villages and seaside hamlets were open to\r\nsimilar imputations late in the last, and indeed early in the present,\r\ncentury. Whole communities have in bygone times—let us trust gone for\r\never—turned out at the tidings of a vessel in danger; solely with a view\r\nto plunder. A tolerably well-known yarn, in which, probably, implicit\r\nconfidence should not be placed, tells us of a wreck which occurred near\r\nthe village of St. Anthony, Cornwall, one Sunday morning. This being the\r\ncase, and the parishioners assembling at the church, the clerk announced\r\nthat “Measter would gee them a holladay,” for purposes on which that\r\nexcellent clergyman well knew they were intent. This is only one part of\r\nthe story, for it is stated that as the members of the congregation were\r\nhurrying pell-mell from the church, they were stopped by the stentorian\r\nvoice of the parson, who cried out, “Here! here! let’s all start fair!”\r\nThe fact is that the contents or material of a wreck scattered around a\r\ncoast were, and, no doubt, are still in many places, looked upon as\r\nlegitimate prey by fishermen and others who would scorn anything in the\r\nform of treachery, in luring the good ship ashore, or in brutal treatment\r\nto the survivors of her crew. “Within the past five-and-twenty years,”\r\nsaid a leader-writer a short time since, “it is said that a candidate for\r\nParliamentary honours, while canvassing in a district near the coast,\r\nfound that his opinion on the subject of wrecking was made a crucial\r\npoint. Wrecking, indeed—so far as the appropriation of shipwrecked\r\nproperty is implied in the word—seems to have held very much the same\r\nposition in popular ethics as smuggling has done. ‘Such was the feeling of\r\nthe wreckers,’ writes one who was at one time Commissioner of the\r\nLiverpool Police, ‘that if a man saw a bale of goods or a barrel floating\r\nin the water, he would run almost any risk of his life to touch that\r\narticle, as a sort of warrant for calling it his own. It is considered\r\nsuch fair game, that if he could touch it he called out to those about\r\nhim, “That is mine!” and it would be marked as his, and the others would\r\nconsider he had a claim to it, and would render him assistance.’” We are\r\ntold that the natives of Sleswig-Holstein considered wrecking so\r\nlegitimate that prayers were offered up in their churches at one time that\r\n“their coasts might be blessed.” Pastor and flock looked upon wrecks as\r\nmuch of blessings as they did a good fishing season. The parson, however,\r\nit was explained, did not really pray for wrecks. Certainly not! What he\r\nmeant was that if there _must_ be wrecks, those wrecks might happen on\r\ntheir coasts!\r\n\r\nThe question of “salvage” is of a nature too technical for these columns.\r\nIn some minor matters it would seem that the authorities do not offer\r\nproper encouragement to fishermen and others to be decently honest or\r\nhumane. At the period of the wreck of the _Schiller_, on the Scilly\r\nIslands, a correspondent of our leading journal(77) tells us “that many\r\nfloating bodies of drowned passengers and seamen were picked up by the\r\nfishing boats which abound in that part of Cornwall. Upon some of them\r\nmoney or valuables were found, and these were given up to the Customs when\r\nthe body was sent ashore. In such cases the valuables were retained for\r\nthe friends of the drowned persons, and a uniform reward of five shillings\r\nwas paid to the finders. Now, for the sake of taking ashore such a body as\r\nI have described, the fishermen—seven or eight in number—would have lost\r\ntheir night’s fishing, for it would not have been safe, even if the crew\r\nwere willing, to have done otherwise. The smallness of the reward given in\r\nreturn for the services rendered would therefore operate as a strong\r\ninducement to the more selfish among them to prefer their fishing to the\r\ndictates of humanity. My informants even told a story of a fishing boat\r\nwhich picked up a floating body, and, having collected all the papers and\r\nvaluables from it, restored the body itself to the deep, and went on its\r\nway. The papers and valuables were given up in due course, and no charge\r\nof dishonesty was preferred against the crew; but the want of humanity\r\ncaused (and not unnaturally) a strong feeling of indignation against the\r\nperpetrators of this act. The fishermen, however, argued that if they\r\nbrought the bodies into port (as they were instructed to do), they would\r\nget, at most, a sum of sevenpence per man for their night’s work; and if\r\nthey brought merely the property to the proper authorities, they were\r\nabused for their inhumanity; and that, therefore, their only alternative\r\nwas to pass the bodies by, and attend to their own work. Should the view\r\nthat I have here stated be found to be a general one, I think that it will\r\nbe allowed that it is an argument for either paying more highly for the\r\nfinding of bodies at sea, or allowing the finders the same salvage upon\r\nthe property found upon the bodies that they would have received had the\r\nproperty been picked up in a chest.”\r\n\r\nPleasant it is to turn from what we may well believe is only an occasional\r\nexample of want of feeling to such a case as the following—one out of\r\nthousands that might be cited. It is slightly abridged from a little\r\npublication(78) which should be in the hands of all readers of “The Sea”\r\ninterested in benevolent efforts for the seaman’s welfare.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: RONAYNE’S BRAVERY.]\r\n\r\nSome twelve miles westward from Tramore—a favourite watering-place and\r\nsummer resort for the citizens of Waterford, and nearly half a mile from\r\nthe coast—a farm is situated which has been long occupied by John Ronayne,\r\na hardy and typical Irish farmer. The farm-house has few of the\r\nnecessaries and none of the luxuries of civilised life, it is a true type\r\nof the poor class of farm-houses in many parts of Ireland, consisting of\r\nbut two rooms—one the sleeping apartment, where Ronayne’s family of twelve\r\nchildren have been born, and the other the living-room, where it is to be\r\nsuspected sundry four-footed friends occasionally find their way, and bask\r\nor grunt before the fire. Rather less than half a mile from the farm is\r\nthe rugged shore, approached by a rough “boreen,” or narrow lane, emerging\r\non the cliff near the course of a stream, which is a roaring foaming\r\ntorrent in winter and spring-time. On winter days and nights, brown and\r\nturbulent, this stream rushes foaming into the ocean over crags and rocks\r\nand pebbly shore; but before it joins its fresh water with the salt sea\r\nfoam, it plunges into a crevice, narrow and deep and deadly. Every\r\ncoastman along the rock-bound shore knows this deep, treacherous hole, and\r\nwarns the traveller to beware of it—for, once in it, there is no return.\r\nBut this source of peril is little enough to that which is beyond.\r\n\r\nA hundred yards or so from the cove into which this impetuous torrent\r\npours frown two massive ridges of rock, offering to any venturesome ships\r\nattempting to run between their threatening sides destruction on either\r\nhand, while only some dozen yards of foaming breakers separate the one\r\nfrom the other. Skilful must be the steersman, and bold the skipper, who\r\nwould dare the narrow channel, even though the only one by which they\r\nmight hope to beach their sinking ship. And yet, on one fearful night in\r\nJanuary, 1875, a large vessel, the _Gwenissa_, bound from Falmouth to\r\nGlasgow, and new but a few weeks before, successfully accomplished the\r\ndangerous passage. Not that any skill was shown, for none on the doomed\r\nship knew of their proximity to rocks or shore, but, driving blindly on\r\nbefore the full fury of the gale, by chance were brought safely through.\r\nBut in another instant the ship struck the rocky shore, and in a moment\r\nwas shattered to pieces, timbers and tackle, cargo and living freight,\r\nbeing thrown, scattered and helpless, into the angry surf. Escaping, as by\r\na miracle, the rocky dangers of Charybdis, the good ship _Gwenissa_ had\r\nbeen hurled upon Scylla, and her doom sealed.\r\n\r\nThe family at Killeton Farm little suspected, as they went to their humble\r\nbeds, the tragedy which was being enacted on the shore; and even when some\r\nof the boys thought they heard cries of distress, little wonder—when the\r\nwind was blowing in great fitful gusts, sweeping round the homely cottage,\r\nshaking windows and doors, and moaning down the chimneys—that, after\r\nlistening a while and hearing nothing further, they thought no more of the\r\ncries, and went to bed. Ronayne had, however, not been long in bed when a\r\nloud knocking awoke him, and he jumped up, and on opening the door was\r\naccosted by three men in sailor’s garb.\r\n\r\nThe first surprise over, the instincts of hospitality asserted themselves,\r\nand he heaped up the turf fire, and, as they warmed themselves, learned\r\nthat they alone of the crew of the _Gwenissa_, nine in number, were\r\ncertainly saved. But there was a possibility that one or two might yet\r\nsurvive; and though the wintry blast roared loud without, Ronayne lingered\r\nnot a moment. Hurrying on his clothes, and taking a large sod of flaming\r\nturf by way of lantern, he rushed down the “boreen,” and soon reached the\r\ncove. Cautiously he made his way, and approached the edge of the stream,\r\nwhence he now heard the shouts of several men. He followed up the cries of\r\ndistress, and soon came upon a man in a most dangerous position.\r\n\r\nRonayne blew the turf until it glowed brightly, and, holding it down, saw\r\na man waist-deep in the water, but so jammed between the crags that it was\r\nimpossible for him to move, far less climb the overhanging rocks. He was\r\nbruised, stunned, and nearly insensible. Ronayne saw at a glance that the\r\nonly way to help him was himself to go down, extricate his bruised legs\r\nfrom the rocks and wreck that held him like a vice, and then assist him to\r\nclimb from his perilous position. This, by means of much pulling and\r\nhauling, he at length accomplished, and ultimately had the satisfaction of\r\nleading the poor fellow to a place of safety, where, for a time, he left\r\nhim, sorely bruised, faint, and well-nigh frozen, for the others, who had\r\nnever ceased calling for assistance from the moment of his arrival. They\r\nwere four in number, and, as far as could be judged through the increasing\r\ndarkness, lay in the very gorge down which rushed the swollen stream; and\r\nso it proved, for one was hanging to a spar which had become fixed in the\r\nrocks, while another was grasping a projecting crag, by which he contrived\r\nto keep afloat. The others, more fortunate, had been thrown on a ledge,\r\nwhich left them in comparative safety, though they were waist-deep in\r\nwater. But though secure upon this ledge, they were quite as helpless as\r\ntheir companions, for the beetling face of the rocks defied their utmost\r\nefforts to scale them unaided. Here Ronayne’s knowledge stood him in good\r\nstead, and after much active assistance in the shape of climbing,\r\nswimming, pulling, and scrambling, he succeeded in rescuing one after the\r\nother, each assisting afterwards to make the task easier. Five men stood\r\nbeside him, cold and hurt, but saved by his perseverance and bravery from\r\na watery grave.\r\n\r\n“But,” says the narrator—and here especially he should tell his own\r\ntale—“not without great labour had this been effected, for one of the men\r\nhad his leg broken, and all were more or less bruised, and perishing of\r\ncold and exposure. Three men were at his house and five here; but where\r\nwas the other? for nine men were on board the luckless vessel, and here\r\nwere but eight. Leaving the rescued men in the lane, Ronayne ran again to\r\nthe cove, and the dim spark expiring in the turf showed him where he had\r\nleft it. He scraped off the ash, and, the wind fanning it, again it burned\r\nup brightly—too brightly, for now it burned down to his frozen fingers;\r\nbut he only grasped it the tighter, for did it not light him on his errand\r\nof mercy? and if another life might be saved at the expense of a few\r\nburns, would it not be great gain? So on sped he along the shore,\r\nsearching into every cranny and cleft and crevice lighted by the turf,\r\nand, burning and shouting between his labours, at length was rewarded by a\r\nfaint cry as of a man in distress—more a moan than a cry, and at a\r\ndistance. Rapidly but carefully he had scanned the beach, and partially\r\nsearched every gully and cleft, and now and again receiving to his cries a\r\nfaint response, but always from far away. No doubt the man was out on the\r\nrocks, to which he had been carried by a receding wave after the ship\r\nstruck, and Ronayne knew that some further help must be procured before he\r\ncould be reached. So he hastened back to the five men he had left in the\r\nlane. They then all proceeded to the farm-house—a melancholy\r\n_cortége_—carrying as best they could the helpless between them. He then\r\nstarted off, wet and weary as he was, to the coastguard station at\r\nBonmahon, where he gave information of the wreck, and demanded assistance\r\nfor the poor fellow out on the rocks.” The coastguard men lost no time in\r\nturning out with the rocket apparatus; but just as they were fixing it in\r\nposition, Ronayne, who had been hunting about, came upon the very last and\r\nninth man of the crew, lying, half in the water and half out, upon the\r\nbeach among a quantity of wreck. His supposition had been correct in\r\nregard to his position on the rocks, but while assistance was being\r\nprocured he had been washed ashore, with shattered limbs—bruised,\r\nhelpless, unconscious, but _alive_! The poor fellow, who remained\r\nunconscious, was carried to the farm, where some old whisky-jars were\r\nfilled with hot water and placed to his feet. The little whisky in the\r\nhouse was divided among the benumbed men, and more solid provision set\r\nbefore them.\r\n\r\nAnd now Ronayne’s house contained over twenty inmates, most of them\r\nstanding round the turf fire wringing the water from their clothes and\r\nwarming their frozen limbs; the few beds, too, had their occupants. For\r\nRonayne the work had but barely commenced. Saddling his young mare, he\r\nstarted to lay information of the wreck before Lloyd’s Deputy Receiver at\r\nTramore, some _twelve miles_ distant, for eight shillings were to be\r\nearned, and for this trifling reward he was prepared to ride some\r\ntwenty-four miles on a cold winter night.\r\n\r\nOn his road he passed the doctor’s house, and sent him to attend the\r\ninjured men, arriving at Tramore a few minutes before the telegram from\r\nthe coastguard station. Two of the sailors were afterwards removed to the\r\nhospital, and recovered, and they and the remainder cared for by the\r\nShipwrecked Mariners’ Society’s agents. Ronayne was indemnified for any\r\nexpense he had incurred by the same Society, and the Life-boat Institution\r\nshortly after rewarded him.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\n\r\n                 SHIPS THAT “PASS BY ON THE OTHER SIDE.”\r\n\r\n\r\n      Captains and Owners—Reasons for apparent Inhumanity—A Case in\r\n     Point—The Wreck of the _Northfleet_—Run down by the _Murillo_—A\r\n     Noble Captain—The Vessel Lost, with a Hundred Ships near her—One\r\n         within Three Hundred Yards—Official Inquiry—Loss of the\r\n       _Schiller_—Two Hundred Drowned in one heavy Sea—Life-saving\r\n       Apparatus of little use—Lessons of the Disaster—Wreck of the\r\n         _Deutschland_—Harwich blamed unjustly—The good Tug-boat\r\n     _Liverpool_ and her Work—Necessity of proper Communication with\r\n         Light-houses and Light-ships—The new Signal Code and old\r\n                               Semaphores.\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom time to time there appear in the public journals accounts given by\r\nsailors who have been saved from imminent peril from drowning by passing\r\nships. Many and many an honourable case could be cited; but there are,\r\nalas! ships that “pass by on the other side.” An article in the\r\njournal(79) issued quarterly by that grand society the National Life-boat\r\nInstitution explains some of the reasons for this sad state of affairs.\r\nThe writer generally denies that the majority of the masters of ships who\r\nwould pass another vessel in distress are brutal or callous, and thinks\r\nthat were many of them brought face to face with an isolated case of\r\nprobable drowning, they would not hesitate to expose their own lives to\r\npreserve the one endangered. There must be some strong causes operating on\r\nthe minds of the men who act in the inhuman manner indicated. Among them\r\nare the following:—\r\n\r\n“1st. That the loss of time which the most trifling service of this kind\r\ncauses would possibly represent a very considerable money loss to the\r\nowners, by the delay in the arrival in port of the ship and cargo.\r\n\r\n“2nd. That the cost of maintenance of the persons saved is insufficiently\r\nrepaid by the Government.\r\n\r\n“3rd. That in all but the largest kind of ships the amount of food and\r\nwater habitually kept on board is rarely sufficient to meet the strain of,\r\nsay double, or, it may be quadruple, the number of men they were intended\r\nfor; and if a ship of the smaller class, towards the end of her voyage,\r\nhas to take on board the crew of a vessel greater in number than her own,\r\nshe is, from shortness of provisions and water, in nine cases out of ten,\r\ncompelled to make for the nearest port, which may be a cause of\r\nincalculable loss, unless it chances to be the one she is bound for.\r\n\r\n“4th. Every captain knows that all owners are more or less inimical to\r\ntheir ships rendering either salvage service or life-saving service. Not,\r\nas we suppose, that any owner deliberately sets to himself the axiom that\r\nno ship of his shall save life, but that they, not unnaturally, view with\r\nsuspicion salvage service, because they can receive nothing from it but\r\nloss in time and money; and cases are not infrequent in which pretence of\r\nsaving life is made a source of real loss to the owners.”\r\n\r\nOne case among the many which could be presented is here given. It\r\nappeared before the magistrates of Falmouth in 1873, in consequence of the\r\nrefusal of a crew to proceed to sea. The ship had come from a Chinese port\r\nto _a port in Europe_: it being uncertain, from the fluctuating state of\r\nthe market, which it would be. The vessel fell in with a distressed ship,\r\nfrom which she took seventeen persons. When in the entrance to the English\r\nChannel, the captain found himself short of provisions and water, and put\r\ninto Falmouth, to land the shipwrecked crew and replenish his provisions.\r\nHis own crew thereupon claimed their discharge, as having arrived “_at a\r\nport in Europe_.” The Bench ruled the men’s claim to be just, and it took\r\nthe captain a fortnight to obtain a fresh crew, to whom higher wages had\r\nto be paid. “The actual and immediate loss to the owners, by this act of\r\nhumanity of their captain, was stated at £270. The only reimbursement was\r\nthe usual State grant for feeding so many men so many days, amounting\r\naltogether to £16 and a few shillings.” The delay in delivering cargo\r\nentailed a heavy loss, and having put into a port not named, she had, it\r\nwas said, vitiated her policy. How might the owners feel towards that\r\ncaptain in future? And again, how might he feel next time, when duty\r\ncalled him one way and interest the other? In an indirect way, this and\r\nforeign Governments recognise humane services of the kind indicated by\r\npresents of telescopes or binocular glasses. Such recognition is\r\nundoubtedly valued by the sort of men who would do their duty under any\r\nadverse circumstances, and whether they were to be thanked or no; but it\r\nis to be feared that captains who were as unfortunate as the one at\r\nFalmouth might think twice before they performed that which their\r\nconsciences could only approve as right.\r\n\r\nThe owner of the relieving vessel should have the right of being recouped\r\nto the full extent of the loss incurred by delay and service—though many\r\nwould never accept it; and a ship’s insurance should never be vitiated by\r\nits calling at a port on a matter of any such necessity as landing a\r\nshipwrecked crew or obtaining provisions. It is certain that we should do\r\nall that is possible to reduce that annual list of ships whose only record\r\nis “Not since heard of.”\r\n\r\nA successful mail-steamer passage or quick run, the first clipper from\r\nChina with the season’s tea, make not only a certain stir in a pretty wide\r\ncircle, but represent a considerable increase of actual wealth. The\r\ndespairing cry of those few poor seamen—who, in their sinking craft, or\r\nwho, perishing from hunger or thirst, see fading away on the distant\r\nhorizon the white royals of some lofty ship which they had watched with\r\nsuch agonising alternation of hope and despair—is heard by God alone.\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: THE “NORTHFLEET.”]\r\n\r\nThe wreck of the _Northfleet_, and loss of life to over 300 souls, on\r\nJanuary 22nd, 1873, will illustrate some of the above remarks.(80) The\r\n_Northfleet_ was a fine old ship of 940 tons, built at Northfleet, near\r\nGravesend, and so named. After various vicissitudes in the service of\r\nDent’s China and other lines, she had become the property of Messrs. John\r\nPatton and Co., of Liverpool and London, and was at the time of which we\r\nare about to speak chartered by the contractors of the Tasmanian Line\r\nRailway to convey 350 labourers and a few women and children to Hobart\r\nTown. The vessel left the East India Docks on Friday, the 17th December,\r\n1872, with a living freight of about 400 persons. The cargo consisted\r\nprincipally of railway material. At the very last moment of leaving the\r\ndocks, her commander for the previous five years, Captain Oates, was\r\nsubpoenaed by a Treasury warrant to attend the Tichborne trial, and the\r\ncommand was given to his chief officer, Mr. Knowles. He was allowed to\r\ntake on board the lady to whom he had been married about a month.\r\n\r\nAfter leaving Gravesend the _Northfleet_ encountered very stormy weather,\r\nand Captain Knowles felt it prudent to anchor under the North Foreland,\r\nwhere the vessel remained until the following Tuesday, when, the weather\r\nhaving moderated, she sailed down Channel, and was reported at Lloyd’s as\r\nhaving passed Deal, “All well” being the signal. On the Wednesday, at\r\nsunset, she came to an anchor off Dungeness, about two miles from shore,\r\nin eleven fathoms of water. She was then almost opposite the coastguard\r\nstation. About ten o’clock the ship was taut and comfortable for the\r\nnight; almost all the passengers had turned in, and none but the usual\r\nofficers and men of the watch were on deck. Just as the bells were\r\nstriking the half-hour past ten the watch observed a large steamer,\r\noutward-bound, coming directly towards them. She appeared to be going at\r\nfull speed, and the shouts of the men on watch who called upon her to\r\nalter her course roused Captain Knowles, who was on the after deck. But in\r\nanother moment the steamer came on to the _Northfleet_, striking her\r\nbroadside almost amidships, making a breach in her timbers beneath the\r\nwater-line, and crushing the massive timbers traversing the main deck.\r\n\r\n  “’Midst the thick darkness, Death,\r\n    The dread, inexorable monarch, stalked;\r\n  And, lo! his icy breath\r\n    Encircled the devoted barque, where talked,\r\n  Or laughed, or watched, or slept,\r\n    The doomed three hundred of her living freight,\r\n  Unconscious that there crept\r\n    Through the still air the stealthy steps of Fate.\r\n\r\n    *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *     *\r\n\r\n  “Oh God, that fearful crash!\r\n    The stout ship reels, her planks disrupted wide;\r\n  Fast through the yawning gash\r\n    The green sea pours its dark, resistless tide.\r\n  What followed then, O heart,\r\n    Thou scarce may’st realise! ’Tis well for thee:\r\n  Ne’er would that sight depart\r\n    From gentle mind that had been there to see.\r\n\r\n  “For maddening terror reigned;\r\n    Honour, and manhood, and calm reason fled,\r\n  And brutal instincts gained\r\n    The mastery; and even shame was dead.\r\n  Each one, to save his life\r\n    Would give to death the lives of all beside;\r\n  Nor cared in that fell strife\r\n    What awful end his fellows might betide.(81)\r\n\r\n  “Yet ’mid that wild despair\r\n    Nobility of soul found room to stand,\r\n  And lustre bright and rare\r\n    Enfolds the memory of Knowles and Brand;\r\n  Who, face to face with death,\r\n    Save of dishonour, showed no coward dread,\r\n  Brave hearts to the last breath,\r\n    They joined the galaxy of Britain’s dead.”\r\n\r\nThe shock was described by the survivors as like the concussion of a very\r\npowerful cannon. The reader will here make his own reflections.\r\nImmediately after the collision the steamer cleared the ship, and before\r\nmany of the terrified people below could reach the deck she was out of\r\nsight. Most of the passengers were awakened by the shock, and a fearful\r\npanic ensued. Captain Knowles acted with singular calmness, promptitude,\r\nand decision. He caused rockets to be sent up, bells to be rung, and other\r\nsignals of distress; but the gun to be fired would not go off, the\r\ntouch-hole being clogged. Meantime he directed the boats to be launched,\r\ngiving orders that the safety of the women and children should be first\r\nsecured. There was a disposition to set these orders at defiance, and, on\r\nsome of the crew crowding to the davits, with a view of effecting their\r\nown safety, Captain Knowles drew a revolver, and declared he would shoot\r\nthe first man who attempted to save himself in the boats before the women\r\nwere cared for. Most of the crew seemed to understand that the captain was\r\nnot to be trifled with; but one man, Thomas Biddle, refused to obey the\r\norder, and the captain fired at him in a boat alongside the ship. The\r\nbullet entered the man’s leg just above the knee.\r\n\r\nMeantime the pumps were set to work, but with little or no effect, the\r\nwater pouring in through the opening in the ship’s side. The scene on deck\r\nwas frightful. Many of the passengers were in their night-dresses; others\r\nhad only such scanty clothing as they could secure on quitting their\r\nberths. Children were screaming for their parents, and parents searching\r\nin vain for their children; husbands and wives were hopelessly separated.\r\nThe horror was increased by the darkness of night. The captain’s wife was\r\nplaced with other women in the long-boat, under the charge of the\r\nboatswain; but the tackle being too suddenly set adrift, the boat was\r\nstove in.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: WRECK OF THE “NORTHFLEET.”]\r\n\r\nBy this time the _City of London_ steam-tug, having perceived the signals\r\nof distress, reached the spot, and succeeded in rescuing nearly the whole\r\nof the occupants of the boat, as well as several others of the passengers\r\nand crew, to the number of thirty-four. She remained cruising about the\r\nspot till early next morning, picking up such of the passengers as could\r\nget clear of the wreck, and in the last hope, which proved vain, of\r\nrendering assistance to those who might have floated on fragments of the\r\nship after she settled down. The Kingsdown lugger _Mary_ was likewise\r\nattracted by the signals of distress, and succeeded in rescuing thirty\r\npassengers. The London pilot-cutter No. 3, and the _Princess_, stationed\r\nat Dover, also got to the spot, and succeeded in rescuing twenty-one, ten\r\nof them from the rigging. The total number thus rescued was eighty-five\r\npersons.\r\n\r\nThe ship went down about three-quarters of an hour after she was struck,\r\nthe captain remaining at his post till she sank. One of the survivors\r\nstates that he was standing close to the captain when she went down. The\r\nformer managed to lay hold of some floating plank, and was borne to the\r\nsurface. The captain, however, was not again seen. The pilot and ten\r\nothers had taken to the mizen-mast, from which they were rescued. The\r\nwhole of the officers perished.\r\n\r\nIt must seem remarkable that while the _Northfleet_ showed lights and\r\nother signals of distress within two miles of shore during twenty minutes\r\nor half an hour no notice was taken of them. When a ship is in\r\ndifficulties in the night, it is usual for her either to fire guns or to\r\nexhibit a flare of light. But here, even the vessels close at hand thought\r\nthat the ship was only signalling for a pilot; and at the time there were\r\nnearly a hundred vessels at anchor in the roadstead, with their lights\r\nburning brilliantly. Those on board the three ships nearest the wreck\r\nwould have instantly sent help had they imagined there was a vessel in\r\ndistress, and they could have got to the ship in a few minutes, for,\r\nthough the night was dark and squally, it was clear at intervals, and any\r\nboat could live, the sea not being rough. It appears that the _Corona_, an\r\nAustralian clipper, was lying at anchor within 300 yards of the\r\n_Northfleet_ when the disaster occurred, but neither the terrible shock of\r\nthe collision, the subsequent cries for aid, nor the rockets continuously\r\nfired from the deck of the sinking ship, could arouse the man who was the\r\nonly watch on deck to call up either his comrades or the officers of his\r\nship. Various reports were at first current as to the name of the vessel\r\nwhich ran the _Northfleet_ down, and which passed straight on her way,\r\nwithout taking any heed of the disaster she had caused, though it must\r\nhave been clearly known on board of her, if not—it is to be hoped—to the\r\nfull extent of the calamity. Suspicion attached to the _Murillo_, a\r\nSpanish steamer, bound for Lisbon from Antwerp. The _Murillo_ arrived at\r\nCadiz on the evening of Thursday, the 30th, having stopped at Belem, the\r\nentrance to the port of Lisbon, on the day before, and having then been\r\nwarned by a telegram to go on to Cadiz without landing her Lisbon cargo.\r\nUpon her arrival at Cadiz an official inquiry was commenced, at the\r\ninstance of the British Consul. From the report of Mr. Macpherson, Lloyd’s\r\nagent at Cadiz, it appeared that her starboard bow had been newly painted\r\nblack and red to the water line, and her port bow showed marks of a slight\r\nindentation near the anchor davit. It was stated, however, on behalf of\r\nher owners, that the painting was done in London or Antwerp, before she\r\nstarted on her present journey, and that the indentation had been made on\r\nentering the port of Havre two years before. An inquiry was instituted in\r\nthe Spanish Courts, and the committee appointed for that purpose declared\r\nthat the _Murillo_ was not the vessel which ran down the _Northfleet_. The\r\n_Murillo_ was therefore released. But some time afterwards justice was\r\navenged.\r\n\r\nThe official report of the inquiry made—at the instigation of the English\r\nGovernment—by Mr. Daniel Maude, stipendiary magistrate, assisted by\r\nCaptains Harris and Hight acting as assessors, stated that there was no\r\ndoubt that the ship which came into collision with the _Northfleet_ was\r\nthe Spanish iron screw-steamer _Murillo_, trading between London and\r\nCadiz, which left London on the 12th of January, proceeded to Antwerp,\r\nand, after leaving that port, arrived off Dungeness on the night of\r\nJanuary 22nd. The _Northfleet_ was anchored in an apparently most safe\r\nposition, a mile and a half or more inside the usual fair course for\r\nvessels outward-bound. The _Murillo_ came down inside the _Northfleet_,\r\nand struck her nearly amidships. It would appear, both from observation on\r\nboard the _Northfleet_ and also from the evidence given by the chief\r\nengineer of the _Murillo_, that the latter had slackened her speed some\r\nlittle time before the collision, or probably both ships would have sunk.\r\nThere is no doubt the shock was a slight one; but the sharp stem of the\r\niron steamer having struck the weakest part of the wooden ship will\r\naccount for the mischief done. The master of the _Murillo_, in his log,\r\nstated that the reason for not laying by to inquire as to the injury\r\nsustained by the shock was that a boat had immediately left the ship and\r\nexamined the damage, and that the boat and crew having returned again, he\r\nconcluded nothing of moment had happened. The Court was satisfied that no\r\nsuch incident had occurred, nor was it mentioned by the witnesses who had\r\npreviously been examined by the Court. The survivors of the collision were\r\nunanimously of opinion that if the _Murillo_ had lain by, the whole of the\r\n_Northfleet_ people could have been saved. They thoroughly believed that\r\nthe _Murillo_ steamed away, and left them to perish, in defiance of their\r\nsignals, rockets, blue lights, and the shouts and screams of the whole\r\nship’s company, which must have been noticed. On the other hand, it\r\nappears that Captain Knowles did not apprehend immediately the damage his\r\nship had suffered, and that no rockets were fired for a quarter of an hour\r\nafter the collision. During this time the _Murillo_ was steaming away at\r\nhalf-speed, and was probably two miles off. Upon this evidence the Court\r\nfelt they ought not to impute to the captain of the _Murillo_ the full\r\napparent brutality of his offence in not staying by the injured ship. The\r\nCourt added a strong expression of opinion that no master of a ship should\r\nbe allowed to take his wife to sea with him.\r\n\r\nOn Friday, the 7th of May, 1875, one of those sad events occurred which\r\nshow the imperfection of many of the most carefully-devised schemes for\r\nlife-saving at sea. Although it occurred in British waters, neither the\r\nship nor the larger part of the passengers were British subjects. The\r\n_Schiller_ was a fine iron steamship of 3,600 tons, belonging to the Eagle\r\nline of Hamburg; she was nearly a new vessel, having been built at Glasgow\r\nin 1873. She left New York on the 27th of April, having on board at the\r\ntime 264 passengers, while the officers and crew numbered 120 souls. All\r\nwent well till the 7th of May, on which day she was due at Plymouth, when,\r\nin the afternoon, a fog set in; nevertheless, the vessel was kept at full\r\nspeed until 8.30 p.m., when the density of the fog having greatly\r\nincreased, she was put at half-speed, and an hour after she struck on the\r\nRetarrier Rocks, off the Scilly Islands, and within two-thirds of a mile\r\nof the lighthouse on the Bishop’s Rock. Although going at slow speed at\r\nthe time, and although the engines were immediately reversed, the\r\nunyielding rocks had done their work: the ship was immovable, and\r\nimmediately filled. All was at once confusion, and a panic ensued, cries\r\nof terror rising from every lip. Orders were given by the captain to lower\r\nthe boats, and until he was himself washed off the bridge, at about 4\r\na.m., and drowned, he did his best to preserve some order, even\r\nthreatening the frantic crowd with his pistol. All the boats, however,\r\nexcept two, were swept away by the sea before they could be lowered, many\r\nperishing with them, and one was crushed by the funnel falling on it. The\r\nship held together for several hours, and had there been any means of\r\nmaking their hopeless condition known at St. Mary’s, the chief of the\r\nScilly Islands, a steamer, and a first-class lifeboat(82) belonging to the\r\nNational Lifeboat Institution, might have arrived in time to save a large\r\nnumber of lives. Such, however, was not to be, and when the morning dawned\r\nall that remained of the crew and passengers who, a few hours before, had\r\nbeen looking forward to happy meetings in the Fatherland with fathers,\r\nmothers, sisters, brothers, and friends at home, were those who had\r\nsucceeded in mounting the rigging of the fore and main masts, and a few\r\nothers in the half-swamped boat, the only one which had been safely\r\nlowered. The women and children who had crowded the deck-houses and\r\nsaloon, and the male passengers and those of the crew who were on the\r\nupper deck or the bridge, had perished. Alarm-guns were fired and signal\r\nlights thrown up continually, until the seas breaking over the ship\r\nprevented such efforts attracting attention; and some of the former were\r\nheard on the islands, but as steamers from America had been in the habit\r\nof firing guns to mark their arrival off the islands, they were not\r\nsupposed to be danger signals. It is said, however, that at St. Agnes, the\r\nnearest island to the wreck, the guns were believed to be from a vessel in\r\ndistress, but the fog was so thick that boats were afraid to venture out.\r\n\r\n                   [Illustration: THE SCILLY ISLANDS.]\r\n\r\nThe mainmast fell at about seven o’clock in the morning, and the foremast\r\nan hour later, when most of those who remained in their rigging were lost.\r\nJust before the foremast had fallen, four boats from the shore arrived,\r\nand picked up several persons from the water, but finding the sea too\r\nheavy to allow them to go alongside the ship, one of them went to St.\r\nMary’s, to convey intelligence of the disaster and to procure the aid of\r\nthe steam-tug and lifeboat. As soon as possible the latter arrived in tow\r\nof the steamer, but all, alas! was then over, and they only picked up\r\ntwenty-three bags of mail matter and a few bodies. Out of 384 souls only\r\n53 were saved.\r\n\r\nIt was about ten o’clock in the evening when the ship struck. A little\r\nfestive party had been given in honour of the birthday of one of the\r\nofficers, but there is no evidence to show that the working of the ship\r\nwas thereby neglected. The majority of the passengers were on deck, on the\r\nlook-out for land, which they knew was near. Nearly all the women and\r\nchildren and a few men were in their berths; others were sitting about,\r\ntalking, smoking, playing cards or dominoes, and thinking little of the\r\nfate which was so soon to befall them. There was not the slightest\r\npremonition of the disaster, and the shock appears to have been so slight\r\nthat few were at first aware that the ship had struck on a rock. But in a\r\nfew minutes the sea which ran over her forced her on her broadside, where\r\nshe lay constantly washed over by the breakers. Let the reader imagine, if\r\nhe can, the sudden change from the gaiety and hopefulness on board, the\r\nanticipations of soon reaching shore and home, to that scene of wild\r\nterror and dismay!\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: THE BISHOP ROCK LIGHTHOUSE.]\r\n\r\nAbout midnight the funnel fell overboard and smashed two of the starboard\r\nboats. Soon after the fog cleared away, and a gleam of hope arose when the\r\nbright clear light of the Bishop Rock Lighthouse shone out. But it was\r\nonly momentary, and dense darkness soon surrounded them. When the\r\ndeck-house was swept away by a sea so heavy that it ran up to the top of\r\nthe mainmast, a heartrending cry, mingled with shrieks and groans, rent\r\nthe air. Nearly two hundred perished by this one catastrophe. Then the\r\ncaptain gathered for safety some people on the bridgeway, the highest\r\nplace, in the vain hope of saving them. Every one, including the captain,\r\nengineers, and doctor, were swept off. The riggings of both masts were now\r\ncrowded with people. With every lurch the steamer careened over to the\r\nstarboard side until the yards touched the water, and the cargo began to\r\nfloat about on all sides. Bales of wool and cotton, feathers, trunks,\r\nboxes, and woodwork of all kinds, strewed the waves.\r\n\r\nA survivor—one of seven who left the ship in a boat and was afterwards\r\ninstrumental in picking up others—said that they cruised about the greater\r\npart of the night near the vessel, and that the screaming all the time was\r\nheartrending, and lasted almost from the commencement of the disaster to\r\nfour o’clock in the morning, when it ceased. Alas! by that time nearly all\r\nhad gone to their long account. The last screams he heard, and which he\r\ncould never forget, were from a little child. Mingled with all was the\r\ncracking of the ship’s timbers as wave after wave broke over her. One by\r\none the lights disappeared, till, at three o’clock, not one was left but\r\nthe masthead light.\r\n\r\nA proportion of the bodies only were recovered, among them those of\r\nseveral ladies wearing valuable jewellery; one had £200 in money upon her,\r\nwhich she had endeavoured to save. That with 1,200 life-belts on board so\r\nfew should have escaped seems nearly incredible; but the panic and other\r\ncircumstances help to account for the sad fact. The second mate stated\r\nthat he had much trouble in getting the passengers to understand the\r\nimportance of wearing them well under the armpits, and that if the belt\r\ngot below the waist it would at once force the head under water. From the\r\nposition of some of the corpses recovered, it is evident that many must\r\nhave perished in this manner. In a number of cases the lower strings of\r\nthe life-belts had broken. The larger part of the dead were buried on the\r\nvarious islands of the Scilly group.(83)\r\n\r\nThe main features of this disaster teach some important lessons. “We\r\nfind,” says a writer in _The Lifeboat_, “in this instance, a noble ship,\r\nunder full control of steam and sail; the captain(84) an able,\r\nexperienced, and careful officer, whose devotion to his duty and sense of\r\nthe responsibility thrown on him were shown by the fact of his not having\r\nhad his clothes off for five nights previous to the loss of his ship; and\r\nthe weather fine, with the exception of the prevalence of a dense fog.\r\n\r\n“If we further inquire whether the owners of the ship had done their duty\r\nin providing their passengers with all available means of safety, we find\r\nthat she had an ample and competent crew, had eight boats, six of them\r\nbeing life-boats, and that life-belts more than sufficient for every one\r\non board were provided, and were to a large extent used, since all, or\r\nnearly all, the bodies that were picked up had life-belts on them. The\r\nlatter may, however, have been of inferior quality—indeed, are said to\r\nhave been so. With so many elements of safety, what then caused them to be\r\nof no avail?\r\n\r\n“The immediate causes of the loss of the ship were apparently the dense\r\nfog and an insufficient allowance for the set of the well-known current\r\nwhich sets out of the Bay of Biscay to the northward, across the entrance\r\nof the British Channel, which has sometimes considerable strength.\r\n\r\n“A secondary cause was the old offence, so general in the merchant\r\nservice, despite all the warnings of experience—neglect of sounding, the\r\nlead not having been used during the day or night, nor on the two previous\r\ndays.\r\n\r\n“Lastly, the chief cause of so few lives being saved, there can be little\r\ndoubt, was the same as that which led to such fearful results in the case\r\nof the _Northfleet_, viz., the custom of making use of night signals of\r\ndistress for other objects, such as to call for pilots, to signify\r\narrival, &c., a folly admonished in advance in the old fable of the boy\r\nraising the alarm of ‘Wolf, wolf!’ when there was no wolf, and then\r\nreceiving no succour from his neighbours when the wolf came.\r\n\r\n“It appears to be customary for the German steamers to make the Scilly\r\nIslands to enable their agents there to telegraph to Plymouth the approach\r\nof their steamers, in order that the necessary preparations should be made\r\nfor a prompt disembarkation of their passengers for England on their\r\narrival at that port.\r\n\r\n“The saving of time, which, looking to the great daily expense of such\r\nvessels, with their hundreds of mouths to be fed, and their immense\r\nconsumption of coal, is the saving of money to the shareholders, and is,\r\nof course, the motive for communicating by signal with Scilly, just as the\r\nmaintenance of high speed in all weathers, and by night as by day at all\r\nhazards, is so, and which leads to so many disasters.\r\n\r\n“All that we would suggest, in the interest of humanity, is that such\r\ncommunication should be left discretionary with the captain of every ship\r\nin the case of fogs, when it should be optional for him to proceed\r\ndirectly for Plymouth, or to heave to, or to feel his way at greatly\r\ndiminished speed by frequent sounding, which would be a certain guide to\r\nhim for a distance of many miles round the islands.” The writer suggests\r\nthat, in view of the too common neglect of sounding, such neglect, when\r\ndiscovered, should be punishable by heavy penalties. It was proved in\r\nevidence that the Eagle line of steamers were expressly prohibited from\r\nfiring guns, or exhibiting other distress signals, to make themselves\r\nknown, but that other German steamers had done so, of which those on board\r\nthis unfortunate ship now reaped the evil consequences.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the 6th December, 1875, one of those sad disasters\r\noccurred which ever and again remind us of the dangerous nature of our\r\nshores. But a few months before the _Schiller_ had been wrecked, with the\r\nloss of 331 lives, and now an emigrant steamship, of the same nationality,\r\nwas to share the same terrible fate off the Essex coast. Happily, the loss\r\nwas not so serious, and led to the establishment of a life-boat station\r\nwhere one had not existed before.\r\n\r\n               [Illustration: WRECK OF THE “DEUTSCHLAND.”]\r\n\r\nFew maritime disasters of modern times have excited more general interest\r\nthan the wreck of the _Deutschland_: partly from the fact that it occurred\r\nso near the mouth of the Thames, and partly because a part of the German\r\npress, in a strange and reckless manner, advanced serious charges against\r\nthe town of Harwich and the boatmen of that port, accusing them of\r\nallowing the unfortunate emigrants to perish before their eyes, and\r\nrefusing them succour. The circumstances are as follows:—In the first\r\nplace, the spot where the _Deutschland_ was wrecked—on the Kentish\r\nKnock—is twenty-four miles from Harwich, and, therefore, at too great a\r\ndistance for the vessel herself, and far less for any signals of distress\r\nor national flag to be seen from that place, even in clear weather.\r\n“Accordingly, the only modes by which intelligence of the disaster could\r\nbe conveyed to Harwich would have been by the different light-vessels\r\nrepeating the signals from one to another, and finally to that town, or by\r\nsome vessel or boat proceeding there. Now it so happened that all the\r\nhovelling smacks belonging to that and adjacent places had themselves been\r\ndriven into port by the violence of the gale and the heavy sea, and that\r\nthe only available means of communication was, therefore, by signals from\r\nthe light-ships. It appears from the evidence of the officers in charge of\r\nthose vessels at the Board of Trade inquiry, although the _Deutschland_\r\nhad been on shore since five and six o’clock in the morning on Monday, the\r\n6th of December, and had immediately commenced to throw up rockets, and\r\ncontinued to do so until daylight, none of them were seen even from the\r\nnearest light-ship—the Kentish Knock—no doubt, owing to the thickness of\r\nthe weather and almost continuous snow-storms, the master of that vessel\r\nfirst perceiving the unfortunate steamer at 9.30 a.m. He then fired guns,\r\nsounded the fog-horn, and continued to do so at half-hour intervals during\r\nthe day, and at 4.30 p.m. commenced to throw up rockets, which were\r\nanswered by the steamer.\r\n\r\n“At 5.20 the mate of the Sunk light-ship first saw two rockets, which he\r\nsupposed to be from a vessel on the Long Sand, whereupon he fired guns and\r\nsent up rockets throughout the night, but did not see the wrecked ship\r\nuntil 7.30 on the morning of Tuesday, the 7th. His first rockets had,\r\nhowever, been seen by the look-out on board the Cork light-ship, from\r\nwhich vessel rockets were then immediately discharged; and at 7.30 these\r\nwere replied to from Harwich, they having given the first intimation to\r\nthe good people of that town that anything was amiss at sea; and even then\r\nnot that a German emigrant steamer was ashore on the Kentish Knock, but\r\nmerely that some vessel was in danger somewhere on one of the numerous\r\nsandbanks which lie in all directions off that port. We have thus\r\naccounted for the circumstance of these unfortunate shipwrecked persons\r\nbeing allowed to remain for fourteen hours in their perilous position\r\nwithout succour from the shore, from the simple cause that no one knew of\r\ntheir danger; and we have arrived at another stage of our inquiry: viz.,\r\nWere the means then adopted all that could be reasonably expected from\r\nhumane people, who would gladly afford succour, if in their power, to any\r\none in distress, to whatever country they might belong?”\r\n\r\nThe writer of the critical article from which the above quotations are\r\ntaken(85) shows, firstly, that there was not at that time a life-boat\r\nstation at Harwich. It had always been considered that the sands were too\r\ndistant from that port for the successful employment of such a boat, and\r\nthat, in the event of wrecks upon them, the numerous hovelling smacks\r\nwould have anticipated its services. There was, however, a small but\r\nserviceable steam-tug—not, be it remembered, Government or town property,\r\nbut that of a private individual. It is right that this should be fully\r\nunderstood. The circumstance of this tug, the _Liverpool_, not going off\r\ninstantly on perceiving the rockets thrown up by the Cork light-ship was\r\nmuch criticised by some ignorant persons at the time. “Fortunately, she\r\nwas commanded by an able and experienced seaman, Captain Carrington, who\r\nknew what he was about; who knew the difficulties of navigating in the\r\nintricate passages between the numerous shoals off the port on a dark\r\nnight and gale of wind, and he could only do so at great risk of losing\r\nhis owner’s vessel and the lives of those intrusted to him; that he might\r\nspend the whole night in vainly searching for the vessel in distress, and,\r\neven if he should find her, that, with the small tug’s boats, it would be\r\nquite impossible for him to render any assistance to a vessel surrounded\r\nby broken water, in a dark night and heavy sea; and, moreover, that if any\r\nmishap should disable his own vessel, the only chance of saving the\r\nwrecked persons might be destroyed.” He judiciously waited till shortly\r\nbefore daylight, and then proceeded, first, to the Cork light-ship, where\r\nhe ascertained that the Sunk light-ship had been firing all night. He then\r\nsteamed to the latter, and was misinformed (unintentionally) regarding the\r\nlocality of the wreck. He, after searching in vain for some little time,\r\nsteamed for the Kentish Knock, and when half-way to it saw the\r\n_Deutschland_ on that sandbank. He then went to the Knock light-ship, and\r\nhailed her, inquiring whether those on board knew anything about the\r\nwreck, or whether there were any people remaining on board her, but could\r\nget no information. He soon proceeded to the spot, and, finding there were\r\na large number of persons on board her, anchored his vessel under her lee,\r\nat about sixty fathoms’ distance, and sent his boats to her. After taking\r\noff three boat-loads, he weighed his anchor, placed his vessel alongside\r\nthe ship, and took off the remainder of the survivors—173 in all. In spite\r\nof the time which had elapsed and the great dangers to which the vessel\r\nhad been exposed, the loss of life had not been so serious as might well\r\nhave been anticipated. Fifty-seven poor men and women had, however,\r\nperished in the raging waves. The tug(86) had done her work of saving\r\nnobly and well, and had performed it at a time when the hovelling smacks\r\ncould have done nothing at all. On the same occasion the Broadstairs\r\nlife-boat proceeded as soon as possible to the scene of the wreck, twenty\r\nmiles distant, but too late to be of service. In these days of nearly\r\nuniversal telegraphy, it would seem strange that our light-ships on\r\ndangerous sands, and our lighthouses on dangerous rocks, are almost\r\nentirely without the means of proper communication with the nearest\r\nshores. From the light-ship, indeed, rockets and guns are constantly\r\nfired, as we have seen in many preceding examples, but fogs and heavy\r\nweather often prevent either from being of service. The expense of\r\nconnecting _all_ of them with the coasts by means of submarine cables\r\nmight be sufficient to frighten any Government; but some such\r\ncommunication, however costly, should be made with many of those exposed\r\nand dangerous spots where shipwrecks are of constant occurrence.\r\n\r\nExcellent authorities on maritime matters have strongly advocated the\r\nnecessity for the establishment of a sound system of day and night signals\r\nfrom all outlying lighthouses, light-ships, and coastguard stations, and\r\nthe laying of submarine cables to many of the more prominent stations. A\r\nformula of “signals of distress” was included in the new “Merchant\r\nShipping Act of 1873,” which came into operation on the 1st of November of\r\nthat year. Prior to that time such signals were too vague and too\r\nindiscriminately used to have much value, and sometimes were calculated to\r\nmislead. Thus, in the case of the _Northfleet_ already cited, 400 of those\r\non board were drowned, “although she was surrounded by other ships, and\r\nthe rockets which she discharged as signals of distress were seen by the\r\ncoastguard and life-boat men ashore, but were unheeded, it being a common\r\ncustom for homeward-bound ships to discharge rockets for pilots, or as\r\n_feux de joie_ on their safe return from distant lands.” The following\r\nsignals of distress are now required. In _the daytime_ the following\r\nsignals, when used together or separately, shall be deemed sufficient and\r\nproper. 1. A gun fired at intervals of about a minute. 2. The\r\nInternational Code signal of distress. This is a square flag with\r\nchess-board pattern, blue and white, having beneath it a long triangular\r\nwhite pennant, with a red ball in the centre. 3. The distant signal,\r\nconsisting of a square flag, having above or below it a ball or anything\r\nresembling a ball. _At night_ the following signals:—1. A gun fired at\r\nintervals of about a minute. 2. Flames on the ship, as from a burning\r\ntar-barrel or oil-barrel, &c. 3. Rockets or shells, of any colour or\r\ndescription, fired, one at a time, at short intervals. And “any master of\r\na vessel who uses or displays, or causes or permits any person under his\r\nauthority to use or display, any of the said signals, except in the case\r\nof a vessel being in distress, shall be liable to pay compensation for any\r\nlabour undertaken, risk incurred, or loss sustained, in consequence of\r\nsuch signal having been supposed to be a signal of distress, and such\r\ncompensation may, without prejudice to any other remedy, be recovered in\r\nthe same manner in which salvage is recoverable.”\r\n\r\nThe signals for pilots are also definitely fixed as follows:—_By day_, the\r\n“Jack” or other national colour usually worn by merchant ships, having\r\nround it a white border, is to be displayed at the fore; _or_ the\r\nInternational Code pilotage signal, this consists of two square flags, the\r\nupper of which is a blue flag with a white square in its centre, and the\r\nlower of which is a striped flag, red, white, and blue, similar to the\r\nFrench flag. _At night_, “blue lights,” or bright white lights, are to be\r\nflashed at frequent intervals, just above the bulwarks. If these signals\r\nare used for any purpose other than that for which they are intended, a\r\npenalty, not exceeding twenty pounds, is incurred. Residents at, and\r\nvisitors to, seaports and sea-side resorts will, from the above\r\ndescription, be able to judge whether a vessel in the offing is in dire\r\ndistress or simply requires the ordinary services of a pilot.\r\n\r\nIn the eighteenth century, the requirements of a maritime country\r\nconstantly at war obliged the Government to establish a complete system of\r\nsignals and signal stations all round our coasts. At the conclusion of our\r\nwars with France that system was in full force, and at that time the\r\nmovements of nearly every vessel, friend or foe, were telegraphed from\r\npoint to point with a facility which contributed in an important degree to\r\nthe security of the country. “This Government telegraph system was also\r\navailable for summoning such aids as then existed for the preservation of\r\nlife from shipwreck. Accounts of wrecks at what may be called the\r\nlife-boat era all tend to show that the system of coast telegraphy then in\r\nexistence played an important part in most notable life-boat and other\r\nrescues from shipwreck. With the long peace the need for information on\r\nthe part of the Government as to the movements of its own or other ships\r\nbecame less urgent, though the coast system of signals maintained a\r\nprecarious existence for many years, to assist the coastguard in\r\nprotecting the revenue. As smuggling decreased, the coastguard men were\r\nreduced in number, and the chain of signallers became broken into gaps,\r\nwhich widened year by year. The final blow was given by railways and\r\nelectricity to the old line of semaphores stretching between Portsmouth\r\nand the Admiralty, and elsewhere, and from headland to headland. But while\r\nthe Government, by the help of modern invention, enormously increased its\r\nfacilities of communication with the great dockyards and arsenals, it,\r\nconceiving itself to be in no way concerned (we suppose) with the safety\r\nof merchant ships or saving life, failed to supply a substitute for the\r\nold semaphore system along the coast line; and year by year the evil has\r\nincreased from the reduction of the coastguard, and the consequent\r\nlengthening of the interval on lines of coasts in which watch has ceased\r\nto be kept. The result is that during the last twenty-five years, and up\r\nto the present time, there has been greater difficulty in communicating\r\nalong the coast and summoning aid to distressed vessels at all\r\nout-of-the-way parts of the coast than existed at the end of the last\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n“The First Lord of the Admiralty or the President of the Board of Trade\r\ncan converse at leisure with Plymouth, Deal, Leith, or Liverpool, but the\r\nEddystone has no means of letting the authorities at Plymouth know that a\r\nship is slowly foundering before the eyes of the keepers, though the two\r\npoints are in sight of each other. The light-keepers at the Bishop have no\r\nmeans of telling the people at St. Mary’s that a ship full of passengers\r\nis slowly but surely tearing to pieces on the Retarrier reef; and the\r\nhundreds of vessels that yearly are in deadly peril on the Goodwins, the\r\nKentish Knock, the Norfolk Sands, and elsewhere, have no means of\r\nsummoning prompt aid from the land, though they are only a few miles\r\ndistant from it.”(87) The writer notes that the number of cases of\r\nshipwreck, where the vessels might have been saved, which reach the\r\nNational Life-boat Institution is considerable. These come largely from\r\nobscure and detached parts of the coasts. A foreign barque was wrecked on\r\nthe Ship-wash, a sandbank eight miles from land, the nearest port being\r\nHarwich, from which its southern end is distant ten miles. The wreck was\r\ndiscovered by several smacks soon after seven o’clock on the morning of\r\nJanuary 7th, 1876, and the news of the disaster was in the possession of\r\nthe coastguards at Walton, Harwich, and Aldborough, before ten o’clock\r\nthat day. Yet the crew were not taken off the wreck till the following\r\nmorning, after they had been more than twenty-four hours exposed to all\r\nthe horrors of a pitiless easterly gale, and the momentary expectation of\r\nbeing swept into eternity. So ill-adapted was the system of sending\r\ninformation along the coast that the news did not reach Ramsgate till the\r\nnext morning, and tug-boat and life-boat then started on a gallant but\r\nfruitless expedition, to find that they had only just been forestalled by\r\nthe Harwich steamer. The Ramsgate men were thus needlessly exposed for\r\nfourteen hours in a storm, with the cold so intense that the salt water\r\nfroze as it fell on the boat. “It is also significant,” says a writer in\r\n_The Lifeboat_, “that the Aldborough life-boat’s crew declined to launch\r\ntheir boat (they being fifteen miles from the wreck), mainly because there\r\nwere no sure grounds for concluding that the crew were still on board\r\nit—information which could certainly have been conveyed by the Ship-wash\r\nlightship had it had an electric wire communication with the shore; or,\r\nfailing that, by properly arranged ‘distant signals’ visible to the eye.”\r\nThe writer shows that had the information been telegraphed from the point\r\nwhich it actually did reach about 10 a.m., either to the Admiralty or the\r\nBoard of Trade, or any other public department, assistance could with ease\r\nhave been sent to the wreck, by orders from London, not the day after, but\r\non the forenoon of the same day. And what might not have been the sad\r\nconsequences of delay, had the vessel been carrying a lot of helpless\r\npassengers instead of nine hardy seamen?\r\n\r\nA case occurred shortly after the above occurrence, illustrating the\r\nnecessity for prompt and suitable communication with land. The steamer\r\n_Vesper_, of Hartlepool, was lost on the Kish Bank, four miles south of\r\nthe Kish light-ship. The crew of this wreck, which struck the bank at 5\r\na.m., though only _four_ miles from the light-ship, six of a coastguard\r\nstation on shore, and seven of another point, received no assistance, nor\r\ndid the light-ship pass the intelligence till 10 a.m., when a boatman at\r\nKingstown saw masts sticking out of the water on the Kish Bank, with\r\nsignals of distress flying from them. Promptly enough then the life-boat,\r\ntowed by H.M. steam-tender _Amelie_, proceeded to the wreck, only to find,\r\nhowever, that on the steamer sinking the crew had taken to their own\r\nboats, and being unburdened with passengers, had escaped to land. The\r\nweather was moderate; had there been a gale, the story might have been far\r\ndifferent. What a reproach to our system! first, that the light-ship had\r\nno means of signalling for assistance; and, second, that it had no means\r\nafterwards of indicating that all hands were happily saved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\n\r\n               A CONTRAST—THE SHIP ON FIRE!—SWAMPED AT SEA.\r\n\r\n\r\n        The Loss of the _Amazon_—A Noble Vessel—Description of her\r\n       Engine-rooms—Her Boats—Heating of the Machinery—The Ship on\r\n     Fire—Communication Cut off—The Ominous Fire-bell—The Vessel put\r\n     before the Wind—A Headlong Course—Impossibility of Launching the\r\n    Boats—“Every Man for Himself!”—The Boats on Fire—Horrible Cases of\r\n             Roasting—Boats Stove in and Upset—The Remnant of\r\n     Survivors—“Passing by on the Other Side”—Loss of a distinguished\r\n      Author—A Clergyman’s Experiences—A Graphic Description—Without\r\n    Food, Water, Oars, Helm, or Compass—Blowing-up of the _Amazon_—“A\r\n    Sail!”—Saved on the Dutch Galliot—Back from the Dead—Review of the\r\n    Catastrophe—A Contrast—Loss of the _London_—Anxiety to get Berths\r\n    on her—The First Disaster—Terrible Weather—Swamped by the Seas—The\r\n     Furnaces Drowned out—Efforts to Replace a Hatchway—Fourteen Feet\r\n     of Water in the Hold—“Boys, you may say your Prayers!”—Scene in\r\n    the Saloon—The Last Prayer Meeting—Worthy Draper—Incidents—Loss of\r\n         an Eminent Tragedian—His Last Efforts—The Bottle Washed\r\n    Ashore—Nineteen Saved out of Two Hundred and Sixty-three Souls on\r\n        Board—Noble Captain Martin—The _London’s_ Last Plunge—The\r\n                Survivors picked up by an Italian Barque.\r\n\r\n\r\nNo greater horror can occur at sea than for the good ship to be on fire.\r\nAt first sight, indeed, it might appear that in the midst of an unbounded\r\nwaste of waters nothing could be easier than to extinguish a conflagration\r\non board a vessel, but examples already cited in this work have shown the\r\ndifficulties in the way. Steam-ships have special facilities for pumping\r\nwater into almost any part of their hulls, yet one of the saddest examples\r\nof a ship on fire is afforded in the loss of the _Amazon_, a steam-ship of\r\nthe first-class.\r\n\r\nThe _Amazon_ was one of a fleet of new vessels placed by the Royal Mail\r\nSteam-ship Company on the West India service, and was stated to be, at the\r\ntime of her launching, the largest _timber-built_ steam-ship ever\r\nconstructed in England. She was of 2,256 tons burden, and fitted with\r\nevery improvement known at the time; her entire cost was stated at over\r\n£100,000. When, on the 16th of December, 1851, she arrived at Southampton,\r\nshe was regarded as the perfect model of a passenger vessel. In due time\r\nshe was ready for sea, and having received her crew and engineers aboard,\r\nand a little later her passengers and the Admiralty agent with mails, she\r\nleft Southampton on Friday, January 2nd, 1852. The officers were all tried\r\nmen, and her commander, Captain Symons, was one of those seamen whom large\r\nsteam-ship companies are only too glad to employ and retain. He was not\r\nmerely an officer of thoroughly competent skill, but a man of unbending\r\nresolution, a man fitted to be a ruler among men, as should be every\r\ncommander of a great vessel. Only a few weeks before he had received the\r\nthanks of the American Government, accompanied by a present of a silver\r\nspeaking-trumpet, for interposing, at the risk of his own life, in an\r\naffair at Chagres between the Americans and the natives. On this occasion\r\nhe not only was the means of saving much valuable property, but by his\r\nenergetic conduct arrested a conflict, which, but for his intervention,\r\nmight probably have been attended with much bloodshed and slaughter. The\r\n_Amazon_, a pioneer of the service she was to inaugurate, left Southampton\r\namidst a considerable amount of _éclat_, and commenced her voyage.\r\n\r\n“And so,” says the work(88) from which much of the following account is\r\ncompiled, “the gallant ship sped on. The wind was right ahead, but her\r\nengines were powerful, and she passed rapidly through the water. But it is\r\nnecessary, in order to make clear what follows, to describe the position\r\nof her engines and boats.\r\n\r\n“The engine-room was about the middle of the vessel, having sixteen\r\nboilers—eight in the forward and as many in the after part. There were,\r\nconsequently, two funnels: one about midships, the other immediately\r\nbehind the foremast. In those vessels which have but one set of boilers\r\nand one funnel these are placed in the after part of the engine-room,\r\nwhile the store-room, containing tallow, oil, and other inflammable\r\nmaterials, is placed forward. But the _Amazon_ having boilers at both\r\nends, it happened that the floor of the store-room rested directly on the\r\nwood casing that surrounded the upper part or steam-chest of the forward\r\nboilers.\r\n\r\n“Then, with regard to the boats: most of the older vessels have life-boats\r\nresting, bottom up, on the top of the paddle-boxes, according to a plan\r\nmuch approved in the navy, and the smaller boats swing suspended over the\r\nwater, from two curved iron props, or davits, as they are technically\r\ntermed, by ropes that, running through a pulley, enable men seated in the\r\nboats to lower themselves from the ship’s side to the water, when the\r\nhooks by which the tackle is attached to the boats may at once be cast\r\noff. But as it would be inconvenient that the boats so hung from the\r\ndavits should be swinging backward and forward with every roll of the\r\nship, ropes are lashed round them and fastened to the bulwark of the\r\nvessel, in order to keep them steady. Now, in order to get quit of this\r\nlatter somewhat clumsy contrivance, as well as to ease the strain of the\r\nboat upon the tackling by which it swings, a different mode of fastening\r\nwas adopted in the _Amazon_. There were the davits as usual, and the\r\ncommon contrivance for lowering the boats into the water; but instead of\r\nthe undergirding ropes or guys, two iron props were introduced, each of\r\nwhich, branching out at the top into two prongs, received in its groove\r\nthe keel of the boat, in which she sat as in a cradle, thus taking away\r\nall strain from the ordinary tackling. This change in the mode of securing\r\nthe boats had, however, this effect: that, whereas in the former case the\r\nboat’s crew had but to lower the boat and themselves into the water, by\r\nthe new mode it became necessary, before they could do that, to hoist the\r\nboat up a few feet till it was got clear of the projecting points of the\r\ncrutch on which it rested. Of what fatal consequence this necessity was\r\nwill become too apparent in the course of the narrative.”\r\n\r\nThe machinery was perfectly new, and, as is frequently the case on first\r\ntrials, became much heated in the bearings: so much so, indeed, that water\r\nhad to be pumped over them. Whether or not the terrible disaster about to\r\nbe described resulted from that fact will never be known; it much more\r\nprobably occurred from some light being dropped upon the waste, &c., of\r\nthe oil-room. No neglect of duty was attributed to the engineers, who seem\r\nto have been exceptionally careful.\r\n\r\nAbout a quarter before one o’clock, Sunday, when the ship was about\r\nentering the Bay of Biscay, Mr. Treweeke, the second officer, a most\r\npromising and practical sailor, being then officer of the watch, was on\r\nthe bridge. Just before, Dunsford, quartermaster, had gone the rounds to\r\nsee that the lights were all out, and had reported that all was right; Mr.\r\nTreweeke then was on the bridge, and Mr. Dunsford was standing under him\r\nto receive orders. Mr. Vincent, one of the midshipmen, was on the\r\nquarter-deck; all was still as the grave, save the monotonous throbbing of\r\nthe engines. He happened to look towards Mr. Treweeke at that moment, and\r\nsaw him leaning listlessly against the railing of the bridge. Suddenly\r\nTreweeke started up, and looked earnestly at something apparently issuing\r\nfrom the engine-room. That officer had discovered flames issuing thence,\r\nand Dunsford was detailed to call the captain: and although he should have\r\nperformed his duty noiselessly, he managed, rather boisterously, to\r\ndisturb some of the passengers. The captain immediately ran out of his\r\ncabin, half nude, and after finding that the fire was serious, ran back\r\nand put on some clothes, immediately returning to the scene of action. At\r\nthe same time, Mr. Stone, the fourth engineer, saw fire on the starboard\r\nforemost boiler from the iron platform on which he was standing, and\r\ninstantly gave the alarm. He even attempted to stop the engines, but the\r\nsmoke was so dense that he was obliged to retreat. One of the men, who was\r\ngoing to the engine-room to warm himself, observed a glare of light in the\r\nfore stoke-hole, and on examination found between the starboard\r\nfore-boiler and the bulkhead a flame issuing as far as he could see. The\r\nfiremen’s backs were turned at the time, and he shouted out to them,\r\n“Don’t you see the fire? Why don’t you get water?” They did not, however,\r\nseem to notice it. He rushed aft, where the hose was kept, and tried to\r\ndrag it forward, shouting for assistance; but by the time the hose was\r\nbrought the flames of fire were rushing up through the oil, tallow, and\r\nwaste store-rooms. The flames were leaping upwards to the deck above.\r\nOwing to the smoke, he was obliged to give up the hose, and rush on deck,\r\nit being impossible to remain below any longer. The chief engineer, Mr.\r\nAngus, and one of his assistants, tried to put on the hose, and kept by it\r\ntill they could not breathe. Hearing a cry for buckets on deck, Angus ran\r\naft as fast as he could, and the passengers were then breaking open the\r\nsaloon door to get on deck. Several attempts to get water to the flames\r\nwere unsuccessful or utterly ineffective.\r\n\r\nThe second engineer, Mr. William Angus, stated that when he was alarmed by\r\nthe cry of “Fire!” he was in the act of “blowing off”(89) the\r\nafter-boiler, and on coming up the lower platform ladder of the\r\nengine-room, ran to set the “donkey” engine (which pumps the ship and\r\nkeeps the boilers a-going). A blast of smoke stopped him, and when he\r\nrecovered more or less from the suffocation he attempted to work her, but\r\nfailed. All the lamps were extinguished by the smoke. Mr. Stone, the\r\nfourth engineer, came to his assistance, but was forced to retire. The\r\nstokers and others found it equally impossible to remain. One of the\r\nsurvivors described the progress of the flames in the engine-room “as that\r\nof a great wave of fire, before which no man could stand and live.” He\r\nstated that it rushed upon his mind that if the boilers were left in their\r\nthen state the water would soon become exhausted, and the boilers\r\nthemselves explode, so he turned on the water into them, and attempted to\r\nremove the weights from the safety valves, so as to ease the pressure of\r\nthe steam. The glass above was cracking with the intensity of the heat.\r\n“It was not three minutes from the time that the fire was discovered till\r\nthe ship was in flames.”\r\n\r\nAbove, on deck, all was horror, confusion, and despair, among the\r\npassengers and crew. The flames, having broken out abaft the foremast,\r\nrapidly extended across the whole breadth of the ship, forming a wall of\r\nfire as high as the paddle-boxes, cutting off all communication. One or\r\ntwo of the sailors, indeed, managed to get across the paddle-boxes,\r\ncautiously creeping up one side and sliding down the other, but all other\r\nmeans of access were effectually debarred. It was the sole chance of\r\nsafety, for the boats were all in the after part of the ship. “It would be\r\nneedless here to tell of the screams and shrieks of the horror-stricken\r\npassengers, mixed with the cries of the animals aboard; of the wild\r\nanguish with which they saw before them only the choice of death almost\r\nequally dreadful—the raging flame or the raging sea, and of those fearful\r\nmoments when all self-control, all presence of mind, appeared to be lost,\r\nand no authority was recognised, no command obeyed.” Meanwhile the ominous\r\nfire-bell was ringing—the knell of many a poor man and woman that night.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: BURNING OF THE “AMAZON.”]\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: THE “AMAZON” STEAM-SHIP.]\r\n\r\nWhen Captain Symons rushed on deck, his first order was to “put up the\r\nhelm,” which was instantly obeyed. The helmsman, assisted by Mr. Treweeke,\r\nthe gallant second officer, worked at the wheel till the vessel “paid off”\r\nand turned so as to go before the wind. The effects of the wind were, by\r\nthis device, somewhat moderated, but it had almost advanced to a gale, and\r\nthe paddles were revolving rapidly, carrying the doomed vessel through the\r\nwater with headlong speed. The flames were driven, however, forward and\r\naway from the passengers and greater number of those on board. To this\r\nmovement, in fact, is to be attributed the preservation of the few boats\r\nwhich, as we shall see, succeeded in leaving the ship. To extinguish the\r\nfire was now out of question; while it was equally impossible to shut off\r\nthe steam and stop the vessel’s way. Yet, without this being done, no boat\r\ncould be launched into the water while the vessel was driving on at the\r\nrate of thirteen knots an hour. Buckets of water were still thrown on the\r\nburning mass; trusses of lighted hay and loose spars thrown overboard.\r\n“Keep fast the boats for a while, and try to save the ship!” cried the\r\ncaptain. But, alas! ship and crew were alike doomed. “Don’t lower the\r\nboats!” repeated Captain Symons again and again; and the danger—at the\r\nrate of the _Amazon’s_ speed—of attempting it was too obvious. Lieut.\r\nGrylls, R.N., a passenger on board, was attempting to lower the tackle of\r\none of the boats, when Symons “seized him by the arm, and besought him to\r\ndesist, as he said everybody would be drowned. Lieut. Grylls then called\r\nout to the person by the foremast fall, imploring him not to lower, as the\r\nship was going so fast. The person at the foremast fall, by constant and\r\nurgent request of the people in the boat, let the fall go, by which means\r\nthe boat turned over, and, as nearly as could be seen, every one was\r\nwashed out of her. Seeing this at the moment, Lieut. Grylls attempted to\r\nlet go the after fall so as to save them, but the fall being jammed, and\r\nhaving fouled, and the boat thus not being clear, her stern hung in the\r\nair for a moment, until cut adrift by some one, when she turned over, and,\r\nseeing the people washed away, Lieutenant Grylls turned away from the\r\nappalling sight in horror. He then met, face to face, Captain Symons, who\r\ncalled out for some one to help him to clear away the port life-boat,\r\nwhich was stowed on the sponson, abaft the port paddle-box, and at the\r\nsame moment leaped into the boat, using every endeavour to clear her away.\r\nLieut. Grylls followed, and also exerted himself, but the flames having\r\nreached the boat, and Captain Symons’s hair having caught in a blaze, and\r\none sleeve of his shirt, he was obliged to run off, and Lieut. Grylls was\r\ncompelled to follow him, both rushing through the flames and fire.”\r\n\r\nAbout this time it was discovered that the ship was veering round, owing\r\nto the helm having been lashed. A fresh order was shrieked out to keep her\r\nbefore the wind, and two of the officers sprang forward to execute the\r\ncaptain’s bidding. The passengers were now all on deck, with what feelings\r\nwe can imagine. “At last the shout was raised, ‘Every man for himself!’\r\nbut not by the captain. The captain called out, ‘Lower the starboard\r\nlife-boat!’ to which the answer was, ‘She is on fire!’ ‘Lower the larboard\r\n(port, or left-hand) life-boat!’ ‘She is on fire!’ was still the cry. The\r\ncaptain dropped the bucket which he idly held in his hand. ‘It’s all over\r\nwith us!’” But though he knew it so well, he did not relax an effort; nor\r\ndid Mr. Roberts, the chief officer, nor any of the officers, all of whom\r\nwent down with the ship. They were last seen collected in a group near the\r\nhelm; and to the close of that appalling scene nobly did their duty. The\r\nlast words the captain was heard to say were, “It has got too far.” He\r\nthen turned aft, took the wheel, and that appears to have been the last\r\nthat was seen of Captain Symons.\r\n\r\nWhen it was discovered that the two life-boats were on fire, attention\r\ncould only be given to the other boats. All efforts must be made: better\r\nto drown than to die in the midst of flames—suffocated, scorched. “One of\r\nthe passengers, Mr. Alleyne, of the West Indies, was observed pacing the\r\ndeck, with his hands clasped in prayer, patiently waiting that awful fate\r\nfrom which he knew there was no escape. A gentleman and lady, in their\r\nnight-dresses only—both of which were on fire—came on deck, and, with\r\ntheir arms round each other, walked over to one of the ship’s hatches, and\r\nfell together into the flames. They had previously been seen standing\r\nright abaft and looking perfectly collected, the gentleman before the\r\nlady, apparently to keep the heat from her. A female passenger rushed on\r\ndeck, having on only her night-gown, the bottom of which and her legs were\r\nmuch burnt. Three times she was placed in one of the boats which was\r\nsaved, but she refused to remain. Several persons hurriedly said to her\r\nthat they would soon give her plenty of clothing when she got away from\r\nthe ship, but modesty prevailed over the love of life, and she remained\r\nbehind to perish.”\r\n\r\nA horrible story of one standing near the helm is given: his face and side\r\nburnt, and a huge blister formed, which burst in; the skin was falling\r\naway in ribbons. A little boy was also burnt black, and the skin was\r\nfalling from him in a similar manner. Still the vessel was dashing forward\r\nin headlong speed, but still efforts were made to launch the boats; but\r\nhere, in consequence of the manner in which they were stowed—resting on\r\niron crutches or brackets, instead of being simply suspended, as\r\nusual—unexpected difficulties presented themselves. It was necessary first\r\nto raise them, put them over the bulwarks, and lower them—a work of time\r\nand labour. In the hurry two of the boats were stove in; and in the case\r\nof others, one end would be lowered properly, the other remaining high in\r\nthe air, so that the wretched passengers and sailors who crowded into them\r\nwere plunged violently into the water, escaping the fury of one element\r\nonly to be devoured by another. In one single case fifteen were thus\r\ndrowned, while one only escaped. Not to accumulate the details of horrors,\r\nwhich constantly repeated themselves, it may be here stated that the whole\r\nnumber of persons on board the _Amazon_ when she left Southampton was 162;\r\nof these 110 formed the crew; there were 50 passengers, and the mail agent\r\nand his servant. The first boat which landed at Plymouth brought in 21;\r\nthe _Gertruida_, a Dutch galliot, picked up a boat containing 16 on Sunday\r\nnight, and another containing 8 on the following morning. Another vessel,\r\nalso a Dutch galliot, picked up 13 more. The total number lost amounted,\r\ntherefore, to 104, and 58 only were saved.\r\n\r\nA survivor stated that during the time they were drifting in their boat\r\ntowards the ship, which was burning broadside on to the wind, her mainmast\r\nwent first, the foremast following; it was a considerable time before the\r\nmizen-mast fell, directly after which he noted a slight explosion of\r\ngunpowder. Previous to this a barque hove in sight, and passed between\r\ntheir boat and the burning ship. They judged her to be outward-bound from\r\nher being under close-reefed topsails. As she passed at between three and\r\nfour hundred yards they hailed her several times with their united voices,\r\nstrengthened by all the energy of despair. She answered them, and brailed\r\nher spanker, and they naturally thought she was preparing to bear up for\r\ntheir rescue. “I shall never forget,” said the narrator, “the deep sob of\r\nhope with which I noticed these preparations, or the bitterness of feeling\r\nwith which I saw him spread his canvas to the wind, and wear round past\r\nthe stern of the burning vessel, as he left us to our fate.”\r\n\r\nAmong those who perished on that terrible night was a distinguished\r\nauthor, whose writings are, or should be, familiar to all readers.\r\nWarburton(90) perished either in the flames or, as some thought, in one of\r\nthe boats which was swamped. He had been sent out by the Atlantic and\r\nPacific Junction Company, specially deputed to make a friendly arrangement\r\nwith the Indians of the isthmus of Darien. As an old and practised\r\ntraveller, he had proposed to stay on the isthmus for some time, in order\r\nto study its topography, scenery, climate, and resources. The Rev. Acton\r\nWarburton, his brother, on receipt of the fearful news, and with the fact\r\nbefore him that there were boats not yet accounted for which had been seen\r\nto leave the ship, proceeded in a steamer from Plymouth on January 17th,\r\nin the hope that, by cruising about in the Channel and entrance to the Bay\r\nof Biscay, some traces might be found of his missing relative. All was in\r\nvain; no further vestiges of the crew or passengers were found. A few days\r\nafterwards a homeward-bound vessel picked up at sea, among other fragments\r\nof the wreck, three settees, or backed forms, which had stood on the deck\r\nof the _Amazon_, and which had been lashed together, doubtless for the\r\npurpose of supporting some of the crew or passengers in the water. Other\r\npieces of the wreck were washed ashore on different parts of the coast,\r\nand a piece of burnt timber was picked up near the Eddystone, having\r\nattached to it a fragment of a lady’s dress. One of the mail bags,\r\ncontaining newspapers, unscorched, but very much damaged by sea-water, was\r\nwashed ashore near Bridport three weeks after the occurrence of the wreck.\r\n\r\n         [Illustration: RESCUE OF THE SURVIVORS OF THE “AMAZON.”]\r\n\r\nThe Rev. William Blood, who was one of the survivors, was landed at\r\nPlymouth in one of the boats late on Thursday night, and was much too ill\r\nto commit his thoughts to paper during the Friday and Saturday following.\r\nBut on the Sunday following, in presence of 4,000 people, he, in the\r\ncourse of an extempore sermon, gave his hearers a graphic description of\r\nthe catastrophe and of his escape from the wreck.(91) The first evening of\r\nthe voyage he sat up till between eleven and twelve o’clock, enjoying the\r\nsea-breeze and the beauty of the scene. He had then retired, undressing\r\nhimself as at home, and had slept well. On the fatal night, however, he\r\nseems to have had an indefinite presentiment that something was about to\r\noccur. On that evening, says he, “without any cause, I was induced to\r\nretire early (nine o’clock), and when going to bed it was deeply impressed\r\non my mind not to undress. I accordingly lay down upon the bed with my\r\nclothes on, even my boots, and immediately fell into a sound sleep. At\r\nabout half-past twelve I awoke, greatly refreshed, and prepared for what\r\nwas to follow. No voice awoke me; no alarm had been given; no bell aroused\r\nme. When I awoke, I felt surprised by a peculiar indescribable sensation\r\nas of solitude, of vacancy; and on opening the window of my cabin, I\r\nlooked out, but saw no person; still all was silent; and with the same\r\nfeeling I arose, went out of the cabin, without even taking my watch,\r\nwhich lay beneath my pillow, and, as I passed along the saloon, I\r\noverheard the voice of the stewardess in the distance, saying, ‘The ship\r\nis on fire!’ I then hastened towards the stairs at the fore part of the\r\nship, and saw (oh, horror!) the blaze ascending right across the vessel. I\r\nascended the stairs just in time to escape the flames. When on the deck, I\r\nhad merely time to walk across to the bulwarks, for on the deck the flames\r\nwere spreading with terrific rapidity.\r\n\r\n“When I got on deck I saw no one, and heard no noise or confusion, so that\r\nmuch of the disaster must have been over by that time. I then saw some men\r\nendeavouring to lower one of the boats near the paddle-box, and at the\r\nsame moment I became fully aware of my awful position, and that I had to\r\nchoose between death by fire or by water, unless I made some effort to\r\nsave myself. With this conviction on my mind, I laid hold of a rope, and\r\nswung myself over the ship’s side, and was just about to precipitate\r\nmyself into the boat beneath me, which was then swinging with her stern in\r\nthe water. In another moment her human freight were in the death struggle\r\nin an element not less terrible or destructive than that from which they\r\nhad been making such frantic efforts to escape; and even at this moment\r\ntheir appalling shrieks, as they struggled amidst the dark and gloomy\r\nwaves, seem to ring in my ears. Here, again, I think Divine interference\r\nwas manifested on my behalf, for an apparent accident saved me from that\r\nboat. Almost crippled as I was, I managed, by the aid of the rope to which\r\nI clung, to regain the now blazing deck, just as some of the crew were\r\nendeavouring to release one of the life-boats from her very embarrassing\r\nfastenings. They succeeded. She was turned over the ship’s side. I was in\r\nher then; and, while suspended midway between fire and water, she turned\r\nkeel up, and her oars were thrown out. She righted in a few minutes after,\r\nand when she did so I was still in her—by what means I know not, but that\r\nthe All-seeing eye was still upon me. In a minute or two more she was\r\nlowered into the sea with her freight of thirteen human souls, and amidst\r\ncries of ‘She is leaking!’ ‘She is stove in!’ ‘She will be swamped!’ but\r\nat the same moment one of the crew in her cut the rope that bound her to\r\nthe blazing ship, and she at once dropped astern. We now made the terrible\r\ndiscovery that she was really leaking, and with the apparent certainty of\r\nhaving escaped one horrible death only to perish by another, we set our\r\nwits to work to staunch the leak and bale out the water. Michael Fox, one\r\nof the sailors—a man who merits much honour for his coolness and bravery\r\nthroughout—actually thrust his arm through the leak to arrest the ingress\r\nof the water; while I handed him my cap, another gave his stockings;\r\nothers did likewise; and then, with such means as these, and with the aid\r\nof our boots and two little empty casks, we managed to prevent the\r\nlife-boat from being swamped. While thus occupied, and being tossed about,\r\nwithout food, water, oars, helm, or compass, totally at the mercy of the\r\ncontending elements, we had dropped about two miles astern of the doomed\r\nship. She was apparently motionless, while the sea continually broke over\r\nus. A barque passed between the blazing pile and our ill-omened craft. Her\r\nhull, sails, and rigging were reflected against that fearful blaze with a\r\nblackness of shadow that appeared to render still deeper the depth of our\r\ncalamity, and which the morning’s light helped not to lessen, for the\r\nbarque had disappeared. After the barque had departed, we fancied we saw a\r\nboat, somewhat like our own, close to us, and we hailed her, with all the\r\npower of our united voices, for oars; but she either heeded or heard us\r\nnot, and quickly disappeared, and the impression was that she had been\r\nswamped. Our frail tenement was still knocked about as I have stated,\r\nstill within sight of the burning ship; and at about five o’clock on\r\nSunday morning, when the powder on board caught light, she blew up,\r\npresenting to our terror-stricken gaze a most awful and sublime spectacle.\r\nVast beams of flaming timber were hurled about in the air, and seemed\r\nsuspended there for a moment, and then disappeared with a hissing noise in\r\nthe roaring waters. A moment after, and all that remained unconsumable by\r\nfire of that once noble specimen of our mercantile marine vanished like a\r\nshot beneath the waves. And then came upon us that intensity of darkness\r\nthat lent an additional horror to our truly forlorn condition. However,\r\nthe merciful Ruler of our destinies had not deserted us; for as the\r\nSabbath morning’s light dawned the wind abated and the sea became\r\ncomparatively calm, except that there was still a heavy swell; but still,\r\nthere we were, thirteen human beings, in a frail, leaky boat, without an\r\natom of food of any sort, the vast ocean around us, and in a state of\r\nperfect ignorance as to our geographical position, while our other\r\nphysical wants, such as of clothes, boots, &c., made our case truly\r\ndeplorable. By about twelve o’clock at noon, on Sunday, we had drifted, as\r\nnearly as possible, to the spot where the Amazon had sunk; and upon the\r\nthen comparatively calm sea were strewn about but too many evidences of\r\nthe last night’s fearful devastation—immense spars, charred timbers,\r\nbarrels, bales, and boxes innumerable. We drew up one of the latter, got\r\nit on board, forced it open, and found that it contained only a quantity\r\nof shoes. To those each helped himself to a pair, and then threw the\r\nremainder overboard.\r\n\r\n“As the Sabbath morning advanced towards noon-day the glorious sun burst\r\nforth, and appeared as a happy harbinger of the fortunate release in store\r\nfor us. The weather was fine, though there was a heavy swell in the sea,\r\nand we were all up to our middle in water. William Angus, poor fellow, was\r\nof no use in the boat. When leaving the ship, he had thrown himself\r\noverboard, fell upon my back, and cut his head severely. He appeared in a\r\nstate of despondency for the loss of his brother; and another poor fellow\r\nhad part of the fingers of one of his hands chopped off. At two o’clock\r\nthe sun shone forth in all his splendour. By this time we had taken up\r\nsome of the bottom boards of the boat, and these we had converted into\r\npaddles, rudder, and mast. Lieut. Grylls took from off his head his shirt,\r\nwhich he had previously wrapped around it, and made a flag of it; and in\r\nlieu thereof I tore off the skirts of my coat, one of which I tied around\r\nhis head, and with the other I made a cap for myself. The remainder of\r\nthat coat I still have, and will preserve as a memento; and so I ought,\r\nfor it served as a protection against the pouring rain, while our bodies\r\nlay partially submerged in the water and the waves at times dashed over\r\nus. This coat became most useful to me afterwards, during the eleven days\r\non board the galliot, for it served as a pocket-handkerchief, napkin, &c.\r\n\r\n“There was a peculiar death-like feeling produced by being obliged to sit\r\nin the water all night, while at the same time the whole body was\r\nsaturated with the rain and the billows poured their waters over us. At\r\none time, shivering with cold and wet, I strove to keep my back pressed\r\nagainst another person to preserve the vital heat. Such cold I never felt\r\nbefore. The casks which we found in the boat were of essential use. How\r\nwonderful that they should have remained in the boat when she capsized and\r\nthrew out the oars, for without them she must have swamped.\r\n\r\n“Dismal were the thoughts suggested on that day as to the future. Will a\r\nstorm arise? If so, our little vessel cannot live; she must be overwhelmed\r\nby the raging billows! How long can we remain in the midst of the wide\r\nextended ocean? Shall we starve—perish with hunger? Such were the gloomy\r\nforebodings, when the thrilling, joyful exclamation of ‘A sail!’ burst\r\nfrom the lips of one of the crew. Then followed the exclamation of, ‘Oh, I\r\nhope she sees us! Does she hear us? Is she coming this way?’ She was then\r\non the very verge of the horizon, and—disappeared! Mute despair was then\r\nplainly perceptible in every face. I had made up my mind to die of\r\nstarvation, but thought I could exist without food for a long time, for\r\nhaving once been ill in Paris for three weeks without even having tasted\r\nfood of any sort during the whole of the time, I felt now prepared to go\r\nthrough the same ordeal. But again the joyful sound was uttered by Lieut.\r\nGrylls, ‘I see another sail!’ We then commenced tearing up the boards from\r\nthe bottom of the boat, and converting one of them into a mast, upon which\r\nwe attached a shirt as a signal of distress, and breaking the rest of them\r\ninto paddles and a helm, we determined, as our lives depended upon it, to\r\nmake a desperate effort to approach the welcome visitor. Hour after hour\r\nwas passing away—our progress through the waves was slow, and the sailors\r\nwere beginning to relax their efforts at the paddles in utter\r\nhopelessness. The sun was fast fading away, and the horrors of another\r\nnight at sea in an open boat stared us in the face. I begged, prayed, and\r\nentreated the men to continue their exertions, that with the light of day\r\nwe still had hope; an hour—perhaps a few minutes—may bring us near enough\r\nto be seen. Alas! there were four out of the thirteen quite helpless—viz.,\r\npoor Angus, the man who had lost his fingers, a boy, and a Spanish\r\ngentleman, who appeared to have become quite paralysed. The sun was just\r\nabout to shed his last ray of light upon our eyes and hope in our hearts,\r\nwhen those on board the vessel saw us, heard us, bore down upon us, and\r\ntook us on board. Had not the great God sent us this timely succour, no\r\naccount of our fate could have ever been made known, for any one of the\r\nstorms which prevailed during the following eight or nine days must have\r\ndestroyed us. We were hauled on board by means of ropes, and stowed in a\r\nlittle cabin, 6 feet by 4½ only; but yet, what a palace compared to the\r\nhorrors from which we had just been rescued! This vessel was a small Dutch\r\ngalliot, and had a cargo of sugar from Amsterdam, consigned to Leghorn;\r\nand was, therefore, desirous of landing at Gibraltar, it being on her\r\ncourse. However, adverse winds set in; the captain of the galliot knew not\r\nhis position; he was unable to take an observation; and was, in\r\nconsequence, knocked about for nine days with this serious addition to his\r\ncrew. I had been visiting the house of a noble friend but a few weeks\r\nbefore, but what was it compared to our present little home?” They were at\r\nlength safely landed at Plymouth.\r\n\r\nAmong so many gloomy incidents, one of another nature may well be\r\nrecorded. The name of Lieutenant Grylls has been mentioned as one of the\r\nsurvivors. But the _Cornwall Gazette_ of January 8th had the following\r\nannouncement:—“Lost, on board the _Amazon_, mail steam-packet, on Sunday,\r\nthe 4th inst., in which vessel he had taken his passage to join H.M.S.\r\n_Devastation_, to which ship he had been appointed as first lieutenant,\r\nLieutenant Charles Gerveys Grylls, R.N., aged twenty-five, eldest\r\nsurviving son of the Rev. Henry Grylls, vicar of St. Neots.” But early in\r\nthe morning of Friday a special messenger arrived at St. Neots, bearing a\r\nletter to the good vicar from his son, stating that he was alive and safe,\r\nand that he hoped to be with him in the evening. The news soon spread; all\r\nthe neighbouring hamlets turned out their inhabitants, the village bells\r\nwere rung, and a party of about 150 persons set off on the road to\r\nPlymouth to draw him home by hand. This the gallant lieutenant would not\r\nallow, being too anxious to return to his friends. A triumphal procession\r\nwas, however, formed, escorted by which this witness from the dead was\r\nrestored to his bereaved father. One can imagine the joy in the household,\r\nand the strong revulsion of feeling there!\r\n\r\n“On taking a review of this overwhelming catastrophe,” says the Rev. C. A.\r\nJohns, “the reader will rise from a perusal of the narrative having his\r\nmind painfully impressed with the fearful loss of human life; and as he\r\nendeavours to picture to himself the incidents as they severally occurred,\r\nhe will be more inclined to doubt that any one was possessed of nerve\r\nsufficiently strong to stand the first half-hour’s ordeal rather than to\r\nwonder that so few escaped. A vessel, constructed of the best material\r\nemployed in ship-building—oak, teak, and Dantzic pine—but, nevertheless, a\r\nstructure of wood, bearing, in addition to cargo, crew, and passengers,\r\n1,000 tons of inflammable coal, and a framework of massive iron,\r\nunceasingly grinding with the force of 800 horses—sixteen furnaces and as\r\nmany huge boilers, all employed in generating the most powerful instrument\r\nof usefulness or destruction (as the case may be) which man has reduced to\r\nhis will—a store-room in the vicinity of the boilers, plentifully stocked\r\nwith oil and tallow—well might the lip quiver and the cheek blanch at the\r\nbare idea of FIRE being allowed to creep with but a flickering light\r\nbeyond its prescribed limits. But, besides all this, he will remember that\r\nto this concatenation of perils—themselves too terrible to dwell on—must\r\nbe added contingencies which aggravated the danger in a tenfold degree.\r\nThe ship was new, her timbers were dry and resinous—not, as is the case\r\nwith sea-worn vessels, saturated with salt, and therefore less\r\ninflammable, but converted into rapid fuel by the unusual heat, which from\r\nsome cause, explained or unexplained, was perceptible at a great distance\r\nfrom her boilers; the crew, though young and efficient, and more than\r\none-half of them practised servants of the Company, were yet strange to\r\nthe ship, not even having had their various duties assigned to them, nor\r\nfamiliar with the persons of their officers, as became evident afterwards\r\nfrom the discrepancies in their statements of names; the wind was blowing\r\na gale in the direction which would most readily extend a conflagration\r\nfrom the probable source of fire to the stern, where the majority of\r\npassengers were congregated; the time was midnight; many of the officers,\r\nweary with their previous exertions, were recruiting their strength by a\r\nbrief repose; most of the seamen and all the passengers were buried in\r\nsleep; the sea was in a state of commotion; the place was the Bay of\r\nBiscay, the dread of outward-bound mariners; the boats, though\r\nunexceptionable as to number, capacity, and quality, were not stowed in\r\nthe usual simple way, but rested on brackets, from which it was necessary\r\nfor them to be lifted before they could be lowered even into that foaming\r\nocean. Suddenly the cry of Fire! is shrieked out; the bell is set\r\na-ringing—the death-knell—the knell of sudden, inevitable, agonising death\r\nto many a stout heart on board that proud but perishing ship. He must\r\nsleep soundly who failed to hear that piercing cry and the heartrending\r\nshrieks which took it up. Some thought it of no consequence: ‘We will\r\ndress, and hasten on deck, that we may help to extinguish it.’ But there\r\nwere some who knew better; they could look a hurricane in the face, they\r\ncould encounter a hailstorm of bullets in the execution of their duty, but\r\nthey knew that, with that enemy on board, the iron beams of the _Amazon_\r\ncould only be cooled by the water which rolled at the bottom of the ocean.\r\nThose brave men did all they could—they gave their charge a brief space to\r\nmake their peace with God, if God were in their thoughts, and resigned\r\nthemselves to His keeping who alone could help them. Before the least\r\nterrified could gain the deck the flames were soaring above the funnels. A\r\nflight of fire was sweeping the deck; it extended from one side of the\r\nvessel to the other; it separated those in the fore-part from those in the\r\nstern; it shot forth from the port-holes; it singed the hair and scorched\r\nthe skin of those who were furthest from its reach; and the air of heaven\r\nwas one huge blast-pipe, fanning it into fury! Are the fire-engines of no\r\navail? They are themselves burning. Then stop the paddle-wheels, that the\r\nboats may be launched. Alas! the engineers, half suffocated, have long\r\nbeen driven from the engine-room, and the levers are beyond their reach.\r\nBut the ship yet answered her helm, and was put before the wind. And now\r\nthe flames were borne in an opposite direction, towards the bow, and the\r\ngale seemed to be diminished. Now the captain cried, ‘Lower the larboard\r\nlifeboat!’ ‘It is on fire!’ ‘Lower the starboard lifeboat!’ ‘It is on\r\nfire!’ Other boats yet remain, and crew and passengers crowd into them.\r\nFatal haste! It was a work of time and difficulty to lift them from their\r\nsockets before, with this addition to their weight it is next to\r\nimpossible. One after another they are tumbled, rather than lowered, into\r\na sea which, from the rapid motion of the vessel, appears to be rushing\r\nfrom them. Some hang suspended, and their cargoes are swept away by the\r\nboiling surge; one is swamped, another is stove in. Still the fire is\r\ndrawing nearer; it surrounds the boilers, and the water contained in them\r\nis nearly exhausted. When that has happened they will burst, perhaps, and\r\nthen the engines will cease to work. Strange that success in effecting an\r\nescape should be promoted by the bursting of a boiler—an accident which,\r\nhad it come alone, would have occasioned terror and dismay. No one knows,\r\namidst the overwhelming din of air, fire, water, steam, human shrieks, and\r\neven the cries of dumb animals, whether this event happened or not. It was\r\nnot dreaded—it was hoped for. It could not have added to the dismay, so,\r\nif it happened? it was unnoticed.\r\n\r\n“However that may be, the ship could not free herself from her destroyer,\r\nbut moderated her speed. A few boats were put off—no living soul can say\r\nhow many—all, probably, that were left, and then, perhaps, the officers\r\nembarked on a raft, and—we dare not carry our thoughts further in that\r\ndirection.\r\n\r\n“The vessel lay a burning log on the waters for four or five hours, and\r\nthen, as if an evil demon had possessed her, or as if some gorgeous _fête_\r\nhad now reached its close, threw up a discharge of brilliant fireworks—and\r\nthe billows of the Atlantic swept unconcernedly over her hissing embers.”\r\n\r\nThe following example—the terrible loss of the _London_—presents a\r\nstriking contrast to that of the _Amazon_. She was literally _swamped_ at\r\nsea, and there are no recorded parallels to the case on such a scale.\r\nVessels, indeed, are often lost by great leakage produced by collision,\r\nbut the cases are rare in modern days and in well-found ships, where\r\nordinary leakage and water “shipped” on deck makes any great difference,\r\nand in steam-ships the pumps worked by the “donkey” engine, as a rule,\r\neffectually prevent any danger from these sources.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: THE “LONDON.”]\r\n\r\nThe _London_ was a first-class passenger steamship of her day. She was\r\nnearly new, of 1,700 tons, and valued at £80,000. She belonged to a\r\ndistinguished firm, and had been constructed on the most approved\r\nprinciples. Her commander, Captain Martin, was an officer of ripe\r\nexperience, and this was her third voyage. She had acquired a first-class\r\nreputation; and for months before the time(92) of sailing, berths were so\r\neagerly engaged that it would have been difficult to accommodate, in the\r\nroughest manner, many more, while in the saloon there were no vacancies.\r\nOne lady who was desirous of proceeding with her family from Plymouth to\r\nMelbourne had made repeated applications to the owners’ agents, and the\r\ncaptain had been consulted, but, fortunately for the applicant, had\r\ndeclared that the cabins were so full that he could not possibly\r\naccommodate her—a result that, at the time, caused her much\r\ndisappointment; afterwards she had reason to thank her good fortune. A\r\nsecond-class male passenger was so alarmed at the rough weather which the\r\n_London_ encountered on her way from the Thames to Plymouth, that on\r\narrival at the latter he went ashore, resigned his passage, and returned\r\nto his home, thus unwittingly saving his life. A young man, as the result\r\nof some family quarrel, had left his home, and taken a passage by the\r\n_London_. He was advertised for in the _Times_, and importuned to return,\r\nhis friends being at first unaware of his whereabouts. Messengers were\r\nsent down to Plymouth, his friends having later acquired some clue to his\r\nmovements, and an influential ship-broker in the town was employed to\r\nintercept his flight should he attempt to sail thence. Fortunately, he was\r\ndetected among the passengers of the _London_, and the fact communicated\r\nto his family by the broker, the result of which was that a brother of the\r\nyoung man went down to Plymouth, and persuaded the would-be emigrant to\r\nforego his voyage.\r\n\r\nThe _London_ left the East India Docks on December 29th, and on account of\r\nthe severity of the weather remained at anchor at the Nore during part of\r\nthe 30th and the whole of the 31st. This fact alone would indicate that\r\nCaptain John Martin, her commander, was a careful seaman. The weather\r\nremained boisterous, and after getting out into the Channel the pilot\r\ndecided to take the vessel for shelter to Spithead. When the weather had\r\nabated she proceeded to Plymouth, arriving there on the 5th of January.\r\nHere an incident occurred, ominous in its nature, and particularly\r\ndistressing at the commencement of a voyage, more especially as many\r\npassengers at such a time are nervous and fearful. The small boat from a\r\nPlymouth pilot cutter, which had on board the pilot and his assistant, was\r\nswamped. The latter was rescued by a boat from the _London_, but the pilot\r\nwas drowned. The remainder of the day was occupied in shipping an\r\nadditional number of passengers and filling up with coal. She sailed the\r\nsame evening. The weather is described as having been then moderate.\r\n\r\nOn the 6th and 7th of January the wind rose, accompanied by strong squalls\r\nand a high sea, which caused the ship to roll considerably. Still the\r\nweather was not so boisterous but that Divine service was held on the 7th,\r\nit being the Sabbath. On Monday, the 8th, the wind freshened to a gale\r\nfrom the south-west, and at 9 a.m. the captain ordered the engines to be\r\nstopped, and to make sail. At 5 p.m. the weather improved, and all sails\r\nwere taken in, and steaming resumed. Early on Tuesday the wind increased\r\nto a hard gale, with a very heavy sea, the ship going under steam only,\r\nand at the reduced rate of two knots an hour. At this time she pitched\r\nwith terrible violence, taking whole seas over her bows. At 7 a.m. an\r\nunusually heavy sea broke into the life-boat stowed on the port-quarter,\r\nfilled her completely, and carried her overboard with all her gear. At 9\r\na.m. the ship gave a tremendous pitch, so as to bury herself forward, when\r\nthe sea carried away the jib and flying jibbooms, and they took with them\r\nthe fore-top mast and fore-top gallant, the fore-royal and main-royal\r\nmasts, with all their spars, sails, and rigging. The masts fell in-board,\r\nand hung suspended by the rigging, but the jibbooms remained under the\r\nbows, fastened to the ship by their stays, which were of wire. Every\r\neffort to get them clear failed till next morning, it having blown a\r\nfurious gale all night from the south-west, with a sea that kept\r\nconstantly washing all forward. On the morning of Wednesday, the 10th, the\r\ngale continued without the least abatement, and at 3 a.m. the captain gave\r\norders to Mr. Greenhill, the engineer in charge, to get up full steam, as\r\nhe intended to put back to Plymouth, in order to refit. The ship’s course\r\nwas accordingly shaped for home, the fore and mizen stay-sails were set,\r\nand she steamed along moderately at the rate of five or six knots. In the\r\ncourse of the morning, the masts, which up to that time had been swinging\r\nabout aloft, were secured, and the wreck of the jibboom cleared away.\r\nObservations taken that day indicated that she was about 200 miles from\r\nthe Land’s End. At 6 p.m. both the fore and mizen stay-sails were carried\r\naway in a furious squall; another life-boat and the cutter were washed\r\nclean overboard and lost. At 9 p.m. the wind increased to a perfect\r\nhurricane from the north-west, the squalls blowing with a degree of fury\r\nseldom paralleled. The engines were stopped, and the ship put under the\r\nmain top-sail only, which was soon blown away in shreds. The captain once\r\nmore ordered the engines to be set in motion. Up to this time,\r\nnotwithstanding the heavy seas she encountered, it does not appear that\r\nthe vessel had shipped much water.\r\n\r\n                 [Illustration: THE “LONDON” GOING DOWN.]\r\n\r\nAt half-past 10 p.m. a terrific sea broke upon the ship over the weather\r\nor port gangway, and an immense mass of water, the crest of a mighty wave,\r\ndescended almost perpendicularly over the hatch of the engine-room,\r\nsmashing it right in, admitting tons upon tons of water, washing from the\r\ndeck into the engine-room two men, a seaman and a passenger. There being\r\nnothing to obstruct the influx of sea, the engine-room began to fill with\r\nwater. The fires were extinguished at once, and in about eight minutes the\r\nengines ceased to work. The engineers remained below till the water was\r\nabove their waists, and they could work no more. The large bilge-pumps\r\nalso proved useless, and the condition of the ship became utterly\r\nhelpless, often rolling into the trough of the sea, rolling gunwale under,\r\nand labouring heavily. The captain called on those who were baling, “Men,\r\nput down your buckets, and come and try to secure the engine-room hatch,\r\nfor that’s our only chance of saving the ship! Secure that, and we may\r\nkeep her afloat yet.” Every endeavour, however, to replace the hatch\r\nproved unavailing. Efforts were made to stop the opening with sails,\r\nmattrasses, and spars, but without success; and although the donkey-engine\r\nand pumps were kept at work, yet the water quickly gained upon them, and\r\nall their efforts were fruitless. It was then that the captain uttered\r\nwords of which he knew the full meaning, and which must have thrilled\r\nthrough many of the passengers’ bosoms who had hitherto been hoping\r\nagainst hope—“Boys, you may say your prayers!” All was over with them.\r\n\r\nAt 4 a.m of the 11th a tremendous sea struck the ship abaft, which stove\r\nin four windows, or stern-ports, of the upper or poop cabin. Through the\r\nbreaches thus made the sea rushed into the ship in such quantities that\r\nthe ’tween decks were soon half full of water. The ship at this time was\r\nsettling fast; the captain went into the engine-room, and, with the\r\nengineer, took soundings, when it was found that there was fourteen feet\r\nof water in her. The captain then told Greenhill that he had abandoned all\r\nhope of saving her, and shortly afterwards made a similar communication to\r\nthe passengers. At about 10 a.m. the captain ordered the boats to be got\r\nready, which was done, and the starboard pinnace, which was of iron, was\r\nlowered into the water, but was almost immediately upset by the sea, and\r\nlost. Shortly after this the captain entered the saloon, and said,\r\n“Ladies, there is no hope for us, I’m afraid. Nothing short of a miracle\r\ncan save us!”\r\n\r\nDuring the hours of agony and horror which had preceded this announcement\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Draper,(93) a Wesleyan minister on board, was incessant in\r\nadministering religious comfort to his fellow-sufferers; and we are told\r\nby the survivors that the women (all of whom perished in the sequel) sat\r\nabout him reading their Bibles, with their children grouped around; “and\r\noccasionally some man or woman would step up to him and say, ‘Pray with\r\nme, Mr. Draper’—a request that was always complied with.” What a scene\r\nmust have been presented at that last prayer-meeting in the cabin, the\r\nship labouring and tossing the while; the waves, with their ominous roar,\r\nbreaking over her and dashing against her; while by half-extinguished\r\nlights little groups of earnest, pale-faced people huddled together,\r\nshivering and trembling, before the doomed _London_ took her last leap\r\ninto the dark waters!\r\n\r\nAfter the announcement by the captain that they must prepare for the\r\nworst, Mr. Draper is stated to have stood erect, and with a clear, firm\r\nvoice, the tears streaming from his eyes, said, “The captain tells us\r\nthere is no hope—that we must all perish; but I tell you there is hope for\r\n_all_!” The reader will know what the good old man meant. Mrs. Draper is\r\nsaid at the last moment to have handed her rug to one of the seamen who\r\nwas attempting to get off in a boat, and when asked what she would do\r\nwithout it, she replied, “It will only be for a few moments longer.”\r\n\r\nAs there were so few survivors to tell the tale, the incidents which must\r\nhave occurred during this terrible time are necessarily somewhat meagre.\r\nOne passenger rushed on deck labouring with a heavy carpet-bag, which he\r\nexpected to save with his life. The captain could hardly forbear, even at\r\nthat terrible time, a melancholy smile at the absurdity of a man at such a\r\nmoment taking any thought about his property. When the only boat which got\r\noff safely was about to leave the fated ship, a lady entreated to be taken\r\non board, offering a thousand guineas as a reward. But it was\r\nimpossible—millions could not have saved her. A passenger who was saved,\r\njust before leaving in the boat, went into the cabin to persuade a friend\r\nto join him. “No,” said the other; “I promised my wife and children to\r\nstay by them, and I will!” His friend helped him to remove the children to\r\na drier part of the cabin, and then, with a sad good-bye, ran up to the\r\ndeck. When last seen, the man was still standing with his wife and little\r\nones. Another passenger said to a friend, also one of the few saved,\r\n“Jack, I think we are going to go.” “I think we are,” was the answer. “We\r\ncan’t help it,” rejoined the first; “but there’s one thing I regret:” and\r\nhe went on to explain how some £500 of his money was in the Bank of\r\nVictoria, and he evidently feared some hitch in its recovery. “I should\r\nhave liked my poor father to have it.” He was a true son to the last.\r\n\r\nAs at the wreck of the _Amazon_ a distinguished author lost his life, so\r\non the _London_ a great actor, the celebrated G. V. Brooke, perished, but\r\nperished nobly. The _Times_ (quoting the _Western Morning News_ of the\r\ndate) says:—\r\n\r\n“Down into the waves, with 269(94) others, has sunk Gustavus V. Brooke,\r\nthe famed tragedian, who was bound for the country which had been the\r\nscene of a reverse of fortune for him, but previously of many successes.\r\nHe was a tall man, of powerful build, and he is stated by the rescued\r\npassengers to have exerted himself to the utmost in trying to keep the\r\nship afloat. The Dutch portion of the crew, twenty-one in number, refused\r\nto work, and, according to the English sailors who were saved, these men\r\nwent to their berths and remained there, so that the passengers had to\r\nwork at the pumps for many hours with the English seamen. Mr. G. V. Brooke\r\nexerted himself incessantly; attired only in a red Crimean shirt and\r\ntrousers, with no hat on, and barefooted, he went backwards and forwards\r\nto the pumps, until working at them was found to be useless, and when last\r\nseen, about four hours before the steamer went down, he was leaning with\r\ngrave composure upon one of the half-doors of the companion; his chin was\r\nresting upon both hands, and his hands were on the top of the door, which\r\nhe gently swayed to and fro, while he calmly watched the scene. One of the\r\npassengers who saw him said, ‘he had worked wonderfully—in fact, more than\r\nany man on board the ship.’ To the steward, to whom Mr. Brooke made\r\nhimself known, he said, ‘If you succeed in saving yourself, give my\r\nfarewell to the people of Melbourne.’”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nThe last trace of the gifted tragedian is found in the following episode.\r\nIn the _Times_ of March 20, 1866, appeared the following letter from Mrs.\r\nBrooke (Avonia):—\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                      “To the Editor of the _Times_.\r\n\r\n“Sir,—On Friday night I received the last written words of my dear\r\nhusband. They were found in a bottle on the Brighton beach, and forwarded\r\nto me by Mr. C. A. Elliott, of Trinity College, Cambridge. They are\r\nwritten in pencil on a torn envelope, and read as follows:—‘11th January,\r\non board the _London_. We are just going down. No chance of safety. Please\r\ngive this to Avonia Jones, Surrey Theatre.—Gustavus Vaughan Brooke.’\r\n\r\n“Will you be kind enough to insert this fact in your valuable journal,\r\nfor, sad as the message is, he has many friends who will be glad once more\r\nto hear from him, even though his words have come from his very grave.\r\n\r\n                                                     “With respect, &c.,\r\n                                                          “AVONIA BROOKE.”\r\n“36, Albemarle Street, Piccadilly.”\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAt 2 p.m. there could not be a doubt—the vessel was sinking rapidly. The\r\ncaptain then directed Greenhill that, as the port cutter was ready for\r\nlowering, he had some chance of saving himself, and that he had better get\r\ninto her. The captain shook hands with him, and said, “There’s not much\r\nchance for the boat; there’s none for the ship. Your duty is done, mine is\r\nto remain here.” The boat was lowered, and four men, followed by others of\r\nthe crew, got into her. When asked to come into the boat, the captain\r\nanswered in the true spirit of a sailor-hero, “No, I will go down with the\r\npassengers, but I wish you God speed, and safe to land!” Noble John Bohun\r\nMartin!(95) But not, thank God! the only one on record; he was but one of\r\nthe noble army of sailor martyrs of whom Mrs. Hemans sung so touchingly:—\r\n\r\n  “Yet more! the billows and the depth have more!\r\n    High hearts and brave are gathered to thy breast!\r\n  They hear not now the booming waters roar;\r\n    The battle thunders will not break their rest.\r\n  Keep thy red gold and gems, thou stormy grave!\r\n    Give back the true and brave!\r\n\r\n  “Give back the lost and lovely! those for whom\r\n    The place was kept at board and hearth so long,\r\n  The prayer went up through midnight’s breathless gloom,\r\n    And the vain yearning woke ’midst festive song!\r\n  Hold fast thy buried isles, thy towers or throne—\r\n    But all is not thine own.\r\n\r\n  “To thee the love of woman hath gone down;\r\n    Dark flow the tides o’er manhood’s noble head,\r\n  Or youth’s bright locks, and beauty’s flowery crown:\r\n    Yet must thou hear a voice—Restore the dead!\r\n  Earth shall reclaim her precious things from thee!\r\n    Restore the dead, thou sea!”\r\n\r\n            [Illustration: GETTING OUT THE “LONDON’S” BOATS.]\r\n\r\nThe boat, into which the captain had thrown a compass, and to the\r\noccupants of which he had shouted their course, “NNE. to Brest!” left the\r\nsinking _London_ none too soon. The number in the boat consisted of\r\nnineteen souls, all that were saved by any means, and comprised the first,\r\nsecond, and third engineers, one midshipman, twelve of the crew, and\r\n_three_ passengers (all second class; no first class or steerage\r\npassengers whatever were saved). Shortly afterwards those who went in the\r\nboat pushed off from the ship, seeing that she must immediately sink, and\r\napprehending that the boat might be sucked in as she went down. They had\r\nhardly got eighty yards off, when the stern of the _London_ plunged\r\nbeneath the waves, with crew and passengers and all. Her bows stood\r\nupright for a moment or two preceding the fatal plunge, exposing the keel\r\nas far as the foremast. The wind was howling so fiercely that not a sound\r\ncould be heard of the shrieks and groans of over two hundred persons who\r\nwere going, in sight of the pitiful remnant in the boat, to their last\r\ndoom. They saw a whole group of passengers suddenly swept off the deck,\r\nand they saw that the remaining boat, full of people, was drawn down into\r\nthe vortex made by the sinking ship. The third officer, Mr. Arthur Angel,\r\naged 20, with noble devotion to his duty, was observed still at his post\r\nby the pumps as she went down. The next minute there was but a watery\r\nwaste over the grave of that devoted band, so full of hope and life but a\r\nday before.\r\n\r\nWith but a few biscuits on board, and drenched to the skin by every wave,\r\nthe nineteen survivors in their open boat drifted about for twenty hours.\r\nThey fancied that they saw a ship through the gloom, and raised their\r\nvoices in one united shout. They were heard, and their hail returned; but\r\nthey were not seen, and had no light to show. The ship tacked again and\r\nagain in the hopes of finding them, and when their suspense was at its\r\nhighest, sailed away, and they saw her dim form disappearing in the\r\ndarkness. When day dawned another ship was sighted far in the distance. A\r\nshirt was hoisted for a signal, and the oars were zealously plied. After\r\nfive hours they were rescued by this vessel, the Italian barque\r\n_Marianople_, on board which they received a hearty welcome from the\r\ncaptain and his men. They were eventually landed safely at Falmouth.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\n\r\n                EARLY STEAMSHIP WRECKS AND THEIR LESSONS.\r\n\r\n\r\n     The _Rothsay Castle_—An Old Vessel, unfit for Sea Service—A Gay\r\n     Starting—Drifting to the Fatal Sands—The Steamer Strikes—A Scene\r\n        of Panic—Lost Within easy reach of Assistance—An Imprudent\r\n        Pilot—Statements of Survivors—A Father and Son parted and\r\n       re-united—Heartrending Episodes—The Other Side: Saved by an\r\n     Umbrella—Loss of the _Killarney_—Severe Weather—The Engine-fires\r\n    Swamped—At the Mercy of the Waves—On the Rocks—The Crisis—Half the\r\n         Passengers and Crew on an Isolated Rock—Spolasco and his\r\n       Child—Holding on for Dear Life—Hundreds Ashore “Wrecking”—No\r\n      Attempts to Save the Survivors—Several Washed Off—Deaths from\r\n       Exhaustion—“To the Rescue!”—Noble Efforts—Failure of Several\r\n        Plans—A Novel Expedient adopted—Its Perils—Another Dreary\r\n     Night—Good Samaritans—A Noble Lady—Saved at Last—The Inventor’s\r\n        Description of the Rope Bridge—The Wreck Register for One\r\n               Year—Grand Work of the Lifeboat Institution.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe _Rothsay Castle_ was a steamship built in 1812, and was little enough\r\nadapted for marine navigation. She was one of the first vessels of the\r\nkind on the Clyde, and was perhaps constructed for the ordinary wear and\r\ntear to which a river vessel is exposed, but certainly, at her age, should\r\nnever have been allowed to leave Liverpool for Beaumaris in weather so bad\r\nthat an American vessel which had been towed out that day had been\r\ncompelled to return to port. She had been, it was said, at one time,\r\ncondemned to be broken up, but other counsels had prevailed, and she had\r\nbeen patched up and repaired for continued service.\r\n\r\nAt ten o’clock on Wednesday morning, the 17th August, 1831, the vessel was\r\nappointed to sail from the usual place, George’s Pier-head, Liverpool; but\r\nthere was a casual delay at starting, and she did not leave till an hour\r\nlater. She was freighted heavily, and it was computed that hardly less\r\nthan 150 persons (if the children carried free were counted) were on\r\nboard. A majority were holiday seekers; the vessel was tricked out with\r\ncolours, and as the vessel left a band struck up its gayest music. Among\r\nthe pleasure parties on board was one from Bury, in Lancashire, consisting\r\nof twenty-six persons. They set out in the morning, joyous with health and\r\npleasant anticipations, and before the next sun arose all of them, except\r\ntwo, had been swallowed up in the remorseless deep!(96)\r\n\r\nThe vessel proceeded very slowly on its course, making so little way that\r\nat three o’clock in the afternoon she had not reached a floating light\r\nstationed about fifteen miles from Liverpool. Arrived off the light, the\r\nsea was so rough that many of the passengers were greatly alarmed, and\r\none, who had his wife, five children, and servant on board, went down to\r\nthe captain and begged him to put back. The captain answered, with an\r\noath, that he thought there was “a deal of fear on board, and very little\r\ndanger.” The whole family was among the lost. The vessel drifted out of\r\nher course, and proceeded so slowly that the alarm on board became\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\n              [Illustration: WRECK OF THE “ROTHSAY CASTLE.”]\r\n\r\nOne of the survivors stated that the leakage was so great that the fireman\r\nfound it impossible to keep the fires up, two being actually extinguished,\r\nwhile the coals were so wet that it was with difficulty the others were\r\nkept in. Yet there were no attempts made to sound the well or ascertain\r\nwhat water was in the vessel. It was near twelve o’clock when they arrived\r\nat the mouth of the Menai Strait, about five miles from Beaumaris, and\r\nhere her steam suddenly got so low that she drifted with the tide and wind\r\ntowards the Dutchman’s Bank, on the spit of which she struck. Now came a\r\ntime of awe and consternation. The crowded boat rolled in a frightful\r\nmanner, and the worst fears of the passengers seemed to be on the point of\r\nrealisation. The seas broke over her on either side. The engine had\r\npreviously stopped for about ten minutes, the coals being covered in\r\nwater, and the pumps were choked. On her striking, the captain said, “It\r\nis only sand, and she will soon float.” Only sand! More vessels have been\r\nlost on sands than ever were on rocks. In the meantime he and some of the\r\npassengers got the jib up. No doubt he did this intending to wear her\r\nround, and bring her head to the southward, but it did not, it proved,\r\nmake the least difference which way her head was turned, as she was on a\r\nlee shore, and there was no steam to work her off. The captain also\r\nordered the passengers first to run aft, in the hope, by removing the\r\npressure from the vessel’s bow, to make her float.(97) This failing to\r\nproduce the desired effect, he then ordered them to run forward. But all\r\nthese exertions were unavailing; the ill-fated vessel stuck still faster\r\nin the sands, and all gave themselves up for lost. The terror of the\r\npassengers became excessive. Several of them urged the captain to make\r\nsome signal of distress, which he is said to have refused to do, telling\r\nthe passengers that there was no danger, and that the packet was afloat,\r\nand _on her way_, knowing well that she was irretrievably stuck in the\r\ntreacherous sands, and that she was rapidly filling from her leaks. The\r\nunfortunate man was fully aware of the imminent danger they were in, and\r\nwe may charitably suppose that he made such statements to prevent a panic.\r\nThe great bell was now rung, with so much violence that the tongue broke,\r\nand some of the passengers continued to strike it for some time with a\r\nstone. The bell was heard at Beaumaris, for the night was clear, with\r\nstrong wind; but it was not known from whence the sound came, and no\r\ntrouble appears to have been taken. The tide began to set in with great\r\nstrength, and a heavy sea beat over the bank on which the steam-packet was\r\nfirmly and immovably fixed. It was the duty of the captain now to make\r\nevery possible exertion, by signals, to procure assistance from shore. It\r\nis said that if a light had been shown on board the unlucky steamer, the\r\nboats from upwards of twenty vessels lying at Bangor would undoubtedly\r\nhave saved the larger part of the unfortunate passengers. The masts should\r\nhave been cut away, not merely to ease the vessel, but to afford some\r\nchance to the poor people. At Penmaen Point an establishment of pilots had\r\nbeen fixed by Lord Bulkeley, for the express purpose of rendering\r\nassistance in such cases. “The world,” says Lieut. Morrison, “will hardly\r\ncredit the astonishing fact that their establishment is within little more\r\nthan a mile and a half from the scene of wretchedness, and that, the wind\r\nbeing fair, the boats from thence could have reached the spot in about ten\r\nminutes. A single blue light burned, a single rocket fired, or even a\r\nsolitary musket discharged, would have ensured this happy result.” The\r\nevidence showed that there was nothing of the kind. Probably no sea-going\r\nsteamer, carrying 150 passengers, was ever left so utterly unprovided with\r\nproper appliances.\r\n\r\nThe scene that now presented itself baffles description. A horrible death\r\nseemed to be the doom of all on board, and the females in particular\r\nuttered the most piercing shrieks. Some locked themselves in each other’s\r\narms, while others, losing all self-command, tore off their bonnets, caps,\r\nand other portions of clothing, in wild despair. The women and children\r\ngathered in a knot together, and kept embracing each other, uttering all\r\nthe while the most dismal lamentations. “When tired with crying,” says\r\nMorrison, “they lay against each other, with their heads reclined, like\r\ninanimate bodies. It was a few minutes before that a Liverpool Branch\r\npilot on board, William Jones, became aware in all its extent of their\r\ndreadful situation. He is reported to have exclaimed, ‘We are all lost!’\r\nwhich threw down whatever hopes any on board had till now entertained, and\r\ninduced them to give themselves up to bitter despair. This was sadly\r\nimprudent, and little like the conduct I should have expected from such a\r\nman. He ought to have set an example of preparing something in the nature\r\nof a raft, to save what lives could be saved; and as he must have known\r\nthat it was low water, and the whole of the Dutchman’s Bank was dry within\r\na few yards of them, and the tide just setting on to it, there can be no\r\nreason to doubt that he might have been by this means instrumental in\r\nsaving many of the unhappy victims as well as himself.”\r\n\r\n                    [Illustration: THE MENAI STRAITS.]\r\n\r\nOne of the survivors stated that after the vessel had struck several times\r\nhis wife and some friends came to him, and asked if he thought they must\r\nbe lost. “I thought,” said he, “we should, and they proposed going to\r\nprayer for the short time we had to live. We all went to prayer, myself\r\nand wife in particular, and when we got from our knees I saw four men\r\ngetting upon the mast, and beginning to fasten themselves to it. I told my\r\nwife I would look out for a better situation for us. I took her towards\r\nthe windlass, and began to fasten a rope to the frame where the bell hung;\r\nand when I had got the rope made fast, and looked back for my wife, she\r\nhad again joined our friends near to the place at which we kneeled down. A\r\ngreat wave almost took me overboard, but I held by the rope; then came a\r\nsecond and a third wave before I could see my wife again; and when I\r\nlooked—they were all gone.(98)\r\n\r\n“I then prepared to die myself in the place I was at, and remained in that\r\nsituation till daylight, at which time about fifty people remained on\r\nboard. As the waves came the people kept decreasing, until all were gone\r\nexcept myself. I remained on the wreck until I saw a boat coming, which\r\ntook me on board, and also rescued those on the mast, and afterwards\r\nothers. We were then taken to Beaumaris, and treated with the greatest\r\nhospitality and kindness.”\r\n\r\nAnother survivor, after detailing the facts preliminary to the disaster,\r\nsaid: “The waves broke heavily on the vessel; the chimney became loose,\r\nand first reeled to leeward, then to windward, and tumbled over with a\r\ngreat crash. The mainmast then went overboard, and remained hanging to the\r\nvessel by the rigging. The captain still assured us we should be saved,\r\nand that assistance would shortly arrive. I requested him to fire a gun;\r\nhe said he had none on board. A small bell was then rung, but its noise\r\nwould probably be lost in the roar of the wind and waves. Some of the\r\npassengers asked the captain to hoist a light; he said he had none; but we\r\nknew he had a lantern, for one of the crew took it round when he collected\r\nthe checks, about half an hour before the vessel struck. The confusion\r\noccasioned by the falling of the chimney and the mast, together with the\r\ncries and shrieks of the women and children, defies description. Men were\r\nseen taking leave of their wives; wives were clinging to their husbands;\r\nand persons were running about in all directions, uttering the most\r\npiteous and heartrending cries. From the weight of the chimney, the vessel\r\ncontinued lying to windward, and very soon after the mast went the weather\r\nboards gave way; and as the waves then swept the deck the passengers\r\nstationed themselves on those parts of the vessel which lay highest.\r\nSeveral climbed up the mast which was left standing; others got on the\r\npoop. The weather boards on the leeward side were then washed away, taking\r\nwith them more than thirty people, who were clinging to them. The cries\r\nwere now more dreadful than before, every succeeding wave sweeping numbers\r\nfrom the wreck. I took a situation beside one of the paddle-boxes, and\r\nwhilst there a young man came to me with a large drum, and said it would\r\nsave both of us, if I held on one side and he on the other. Some females\r\ncame and clung round us, but the young man stuck to the drum, and told\r\nthem to get hold of the first piece of timber they could.... Of what\r\nfurther happened I have but a confused recollection, and it appears to me\r\nlike the traces of a horrible dream. It seemed as if I had been in the\r\nwater many days, when I heard the welcome sound of a human voice shout\r\n‘Holloa!’ to which I also shouted ‘Holloa!’ Soon after I was lifted out of\r\nthe water, and placed in a boat belonging to R. Williamson, Esq., who,\r\nwhen he was informed of the calamity which had befallen us, manned two\r\nboats, and came out to pick up the sufferers. On being taken up I asked my\r\ndeliverers when it would be daylight, and they told me it was broad day—it\r\nwas about ten o’clock in the forenoon. I was stone blind. Mr. Williamson\r\nand the boat’s crew were most kind to me. I was kept on board until I was\r\nsufficiently restored to meet my sister and the other survivors at\r\nBeaumaris. I cannot omit to express my most grateful thanks to my\r\ndeliverers and benefactors. Their noble humanity has left an impression on\r\nmy heart which will never be effaced but with my existence.”\r\n\r\n“Amidst these almost overwhelming distresses,” says the Rev. Mr. Stewart,\r\nin one of his letters to a friend, “involving in one general calamity men,\r\nwomen, children, and even tender infants, it is a rest to the heart to\r\nturn for a moment to some special marks of divine mercy. I am sure, my\r\nvery dear friend, the following incident, related to me by the father of\r\nthe boy, will deeply affect you. He was near the helm with his child,\r\ngrasping his hand, till the waves, rolling over the quarter-deck, and\r\ntaking with them several persons who were standing near them, it was no\r\nlonger safe to remain there. The father took his child in his hands and\r\nran towards the shrouds, but the boy could not mount with him. He cried\r\nout, therefore, ‘Father! father! do not leave me!’ But finding that his\r\nson could not climb with him, and that his own life was in danger, he\r\nwithdrew his hand. When the morning came, the father was conveyed on shore\r\nwith some other passengers who were preserved, and as he was landing he\r\nsaid within himself, ‘How can I see my wife without having our boy with\r\nme?’ When, however, the child’s earthly parent let go his hand his\r\nHeavenly Father did not leave him. He was washed off the deck, but happily\r\nclung to a part of the wreck on which some others of the passengers were\r\nfloating. With them he was almost miraculously preserved. When he was\r\nlanding, not knowing of his father’s safety, he said, ‘It is of no use to\r\ntake me on shore now I have lost my father.’ He was, however, carried,\r\nmuch exhausted, to the same house where his father had been sent, and\r\nactually placed in the same bed, unknown to either, till they were clasped\r\nin each other’s arms.”\r\n\r\nAmong the victims was that of a lady entirely _unknown_. The body of this\r\npoor creature had been picked up near Conway, and it was evident that she\r\nhad been one of fortune’s favourites, though destined to a death so cruel.\r\nShe was elegantly and fashionably attired, wearing rich earrings, gold\r\nchain and locket, three valuable rings in addition to her wedding-ring,\r\nand so forth. In a day or two she was buried in a common deal shell, and\r\nfollowed to a nameless grave by strangers.\r\n\r\nIt appears, by the pilot’s statement, that early in the afternoon he had\r\nbeen invited by the steward to take some refreshment with him, and in the\r\ncourse of conversation a very strong opinion was given by the steward that\r\nCaptain Atkinson never _intended_ to reach Beaumaris, and that the voyage\r\nhe was now making would be his last. By the expression “intended” he\r\nexplained was meant _expected_, and the result proved the opinion to be\r\ntoo fatally correct. Tired by what he had gone through before entering the\r\npacket, the pilot lay down in the forecastle to sleep. He was aroused by a\r\nsensation beyond all others most dreadful—he felt the vessel strike, and\r\nhis experience told him all was over. Hastily rushing upon deck, his\r\ncourage and coolness were for a moment quite overcome. “I saw,” said he,\r\n“the quality huddled together in the waist of the vessel; and the praying\r\nand crying was the most dreadful sight to witness. The waves broke over on\r\nboth sides, and took away numbers at once. They went like flights,\r\nsometimes many, sometimes few; at last the bulwark went, and none were\r\nleft.”\r\n\r\nThe vessel had scarcely struck when the two stays of the chimney broke.\r\nThese, after many ineffectual efforts, were again made fast; but they soon\r\ngave way a second time, and the chimney fell across the deck, bringing the\r\nmainmast with it. The mast, it is stated, fell aft along the lee or\r\nlarboard side of the quarter deck, and struck overboard some of the\r\nunfortunate creatures who had there collected. The steward of the vessel\r\nand his wife lashed themselves to the mast, determined to spend their last\r\nmoments in each other’s arms. Several husbands and wives seem to have met\r\ntheir fate together, whilst parents clung to their little ones. Several\r\nmothers, it is said, perished with their little ones clasped in their\r\narms. The carpenter and his wife were seen embracing each other and their\r\nchild in the extreme of agony. The poor woman asked a young man, Henry\r\nHammond, to pull her cloak over her shoulders, when a tremendous wave came\r\nand washed off, in a moment, twelve persons, and her among them.\r\n\r\nSoon after the crash the captain’s voice was heard for the last time. He\r\nand the mate appear to have been the very first that perished, and the\r\nconclusion is that they must have been dragged overboard by the wreck of\r\nthe mainmast. It is true that an absurd report was spread in Beaumaris\r\nthat both captain and mate reached land safely in the boat, part of which\r\nwas found on shore early in the morning. This is unlikely; but it is quite\r\npossible many lives might have been saved in the boat, _if she had been\r\nprovided with oars_. The absence of these, however, shows in a glaring\r\nmanner the utter recklessness of human life which marked the whole affair.\r\nIt was stated by Mr. Henry Hammond, ship-carver, of Liverpool, one of the\r\npersons saved, that it was not true that a party of the passengers got\r\ninto the boat soon after the vessel struck, and were immediately swamped.\r\nThe statement he gave was that the boat was hanging by the davits over the\r\nstern, nearly filled with water in consequence of the spray; when the\r\nvessel struck, he and the wife and child of the carpenter got into the\r\nboat, but left it again, being ordered out by the mate, who told them it\r\nwas of no use, as no boat could live in such a sea. The boat soon after\r\nbroke adrift and was lost, but there was no person in her.\r\n\r\n“For above a mile and a half to the spit-buoy in the Friar’s Road,” says\r\nMorrison, “the sand is dry at half ebb, and as the Dutchman’s Bank is dry\r\nat low water, I have no hesitation in affirming that there was dry land\r\nwithin half a mile of the wreck when she struck; and that if they had\r\n_been informed_ of the fact, many of them on board might have swam or been\r\ndrifted over the Swash, and within two hundred yards of the vessel would\r\nhave found themselves in not more than three or four feet of water.”\r\n\r\nThe Swash is very few feet wide, and was easily passed by one individual,\r\nwho, being a resident in Bangor, knew the locality, and escaped, according\r\nto Mr. Whittaker’s narrative, who states as follows:—“At this time a\r\ngentleman from Bangor left the vessel, with a small barrel tied beneath\r\nhis chin, and an umbrella in his hand, which he unfurled when he got into\r\nthe water, in the hope of being drifted ashore in time to send some aid to\r\nhis fellow-sufferers.” This was Mr. Jones of Bangor. Now, if Mr. Jones,\r\nthe pilot, or the captain or mate, or any other person on board, who knew\r\nof the vicinity of the dry sand, on which people walk at low water, had\r\nexplained to the persons who could swim the state of the case, many others\r\nmight have been saved as well as Mr. Jones.\r\n\r\nA Mr. Tarry, who was exceedingly apprehensive during the passage, kept his\r\nwife and children in the cabin; on the vessel striking he made immediate\r\ninquiries respecting their probable fate; and Jones, the pilot, having\r\nindiscreetly said that there was no hope of safety, he became at once\r\ncalm, and said in a tone of resignation, “I brought out my family, and to\r\nreturn without them would be worse than death; I’ll, therefore, die with\r\nthem.” He then went down into the cabin and embraced his wife and\r\nchildren. It would appear that they afterwards, impelled by a sense of\r\nself-preservation, came on deck; one at least of his little girls was seen\r\nafterwards in a state of pitiable helplessness. Mr. Duckworth, of Bury,\r\nwho survived the catastrophe, says that while sustaining his wife he saw\r\nher on the quarter-deck. She was about ten years old. Each wave that broke\r\ndown on one side of the vessel hurled her along with impetuous force, and\r\ndashed her against the gunwale on the other side; and then it would\r\nrecede, and draw her back again, a ready victim for another similar shock.\r\nThe poor innocent, bruised and half choked with the waves, sent forth the\r\nmost piteous cries for her father and mother between each rush of the\r\nwaters. Her shrieks were piercing beyond description, and she screamed\r\n“Oh! won’t you come to me, father? Oh, mamma!” &c., till the narrator says\r\nhis heart yearned to save her; and though he dared not quit his wife, he\r\ncalled to a fellow-passenger to make the effort; but he believes she was\r\nwashed away soon afterwards.\r\n\r\n                      [Illustration: SAVED AT LAST.]\r\n\r\n“A schooner, belonging to a nephew of Alderman Wright, was lying off\r\nBeaumaris Green; the persons on board heard the bell ring in the _Rothsay\r\nCastle_, but in consequence of no light being displayed, which the captain\r\nrefused to allow, they could not tell in what direction to go to render\r\nassistance. They eventually saved several persons who had been seven hours\r\nin the water. Such was the state of anxiety of the poor creatures, who had\r\nbeen so long hanging to the wreck, that they imagined, when taken up at\r\nseven o’clock in the morning, that it was noon.”\r\n\r\n                        [Illustration: BEAUMARIS.]\r\n\r\nLieutenant Morrison speaks highly of the humanity and honesty of the\r\nWelshmen of the coast on which the unfortunate vessel was wrecked, and\r\ncontrasts their conduct with that of the people of certain other places.\r\nHe remembered, in the year 1816, witnessing the wreck of a vessel near\r\nAppledore, in the Bay of Barnstaple, when the country people came down in\r\ncrowds to plunder the wreck, and they drove the poor seamen back into the\r\nsurf when they attempted to rescue a part of their property. In the winter\r\nof 1827 he recalled the case of a crowd surrounding the mate of a Welsh\r\nsloop wrecked on the coast of Waterford, whom they knocked down and robbed\r\nof a small bundle of clothes, all that he had saved from the wreck.\r\n\r\nThe wreck about to be described occurred in January, 1838, and has been\r\nrecorded in a graphic though somewhat verbose pamphlet,(99) which it is\r\nvery unlikely has reached the eyes of many of our readers. It has often\r\nstruck the writer that the most fascinating and interesting descriptions\r\nof wrecks have not been written by sailors, and there is a sufficient\r\nreason for this. Many of the episodes which strike a landsman forcibly,\r\nand add greatly to the picturesque _ensemble_ of his narration, are taken\r\nby the seaman as mere matters of course. Several of the more detailed and\r\ninteresting narratives already given have been taken from accounts\r\nrecorded by the members of other professions, clergymen and military men\r\nmore particularly. The present account is compiled from the narrative\r\nfurnished by a medical man.\r\n\r\nThe _Killarney_ sailed from Cork on the 19th January of the above year,\r\nwith about fifty on board, passengers and crew. The weather was very\r\nsevere, the wind blowing hard from the east, accompanied by snow and hail\r\nsqualls; and the captain, after vainly endeavouring to make headway,\r\nturned the vessel round and returned to Cove Harbour. The weather\r\nmoderating, the _Killarney_ again got under weigh for her port of\r\ndestination, Bristol. Again a storm rose, and the mist became so dense\r\nthat they could scarcely see the vessel’s length ahead of them. During the\r\nnight 150 pigs—about a fourth of the number on the vessel—were washed\r\noverboard; the cabin was a wreck of furniture and crockery; and Dr.\r\nSpolasco’s gig had been forced from its lashings, broken up, and partly\r\nwashed away. The engine stopped for some time, and the vessel lay to, the\r\ncaptain not knowing his position. A suspicious circumstance, showing that\r\nthe men were disheartened and greatly fatigued, was that they came down to\r\nthe cabin and asked for bottles of porter, &c.—a most unusual request, of\r\ncourse. Lieut. Nicolay, a military passenger, remarked, “I don’t like to\r\nsee these men getting porter in this way; I was once at sea in great\r\ndanger, and the sailors through desperation commenced to drink.” If the\r\nsailors were doubtful of the vessel’s safety, there can be little wonder\r\nthat the passengers generally were in a state of grave alarm. Baron\r\nSpolasco had his boy, a helpless child of nine years of age, on board, and\r\nbetween his care, giving advice to passengers, and setting the leg of the\r\nunder-steward, who had broken it in a violent fall caused by the lurching\r\nof the ship, he had enough to do. At noon of Saturday it was whispered\r\nthat the captain intended to try for land, but no one on board appeared to\r\nknow whether they were twenty or fifty miles from it. The weather\r\nincreased in severity.\r\n\r\nIn these trying moments, the captain, mate, and crew, endeavoured to\r\nperform their duties, and used every exertion in their power to weather\r\nthe dreadful storm; but the water gained incessantly on the pumps, and the\r\nvessel continued to fill, and, being almost on her broadside, the deck was\r\nnearly perpendicular. The sea broke over her continually, and the\r\npassengers crawled about on hands and knees. Spolasco inquired of\r\nM‘Arthur, the chief engineer, entreating him to let him know how the water\r\nstood in the engine-room. He seemed much exhausted, and said, “We’re\r\ngetting the water down to the plates of the engines; the fires are\r\nre-kindled, and we’ll soon have steam on.” For a time this was\r\nsuccessfully done.\r\n\r\nLieut. Nicolay was the first to announce “Land at last!” to the\r\npassengers, and all hearts beat with joy at the welcome news. But they\r\nwere greatly puzzled, and indeed mortified, that they were unable to\r\nascertain what land it was. Some said that it was Poor Head, others that\r\nit was Kinsale, and others that it was Youghal, and others again that it\r\nwas Cork Harbour. But the vessel was now utterly unmanageable.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: ENTRANCE TO CORK HARBOUR.]\r\n\r\nThe captain again did his best to re-make Cork Harbour, but it was out of\r\nhis power, the sails having been blown to ribbons, and the fires put out\r\nowing to the repeated shipping of the seas. The engines went on pretty\r\nwell when they commenced working a second time, but they shortly became\r\nless and less powerful from the cause just assigned. About three o’clock\r\nin the afternoon she had drifted near some rocks, the vessel being then\r\nnearly on her beam ends. It was all that the passengers or crew could do\r\nto hold on the bulwarks or ropes, and from the terror depicted on every\r\ncountenance it was evident that the crisis was at hand. The vessel struck,\r\nand a simultaneous thrill of horror passed through every breast. Two\r\ngentlemen were, it was believed, washed overboard at this time.\r\n\r\nA heavy sea then struck abaft the paddle-box, carrying off all before it.\r\nThe doctor descried poor Nicolay on the top of a wave, like a mountain\r\nover them, as it were riding on, and buffeting in vain with his gigantic\r\nenemy. An awful and terrific scene was witnessed while grasping his child\r\nand the companion. “I believe,” says he, “it was the same sea, or one\r\ninstantaneously succeeding it, that struck the companion, and carried me\r\nand my dear little charge across the deck. Had it not been for the remnant\r\nof the bulwarks, viz., two uprights, across which a deck-form was forced,\r\nwhich proved the simple means of saving our lives at that period—were it\r\nnot for this circumstance, my child and myself must have perished with\r\nNicolay and others. Several fragments of deck-rigging fell upon us—such as\r\nropes, spars, splinters, &c.; and it was with the utmost difficulty that I\r\nwas enabled to extricate myself and child from them, in doing which I lost\r\na shoe. It is worthy of remark that I had not worn shoes for more than six\r\nmonths before, having put them on that morning, considering that they\r\nwould contribute to my ease while on board. My little boy also lost a shoe\r\nand cap owing to this circumstance. I now ought to remark, before I\r\nproceed further with this painful narrative, that immediately, or rather\r\nbefore, the engines stopped the second time from the vessel filling with\r\nwater, the engineers and firemen came upon deck, from the impossibility of\r\ntheir remaining any longer below, the steam gradually going down, and the\r\nengines consequently decreasing in power till they came to a stand. All\r\nfurther efforts on their part being unavailing, and destruction being\r\ninevitable, all rushed upon deck, leaving the engines in order to save\r\ntheir lives.”\r\n\r\nMatters for some time continuing thus, the sailors and some of the deck\r\npassengers exerted themselves, and were engaged in endeavouring with\r\nbuckets to lighten the vessel of some of the water in the hold; and, after\r\nseveral hours’ hard work, they so far succeeded (the pumps all the while\r\nkept going) as to be able early on Saturday afternoon to get up steam\r\nagain.\r\n\r\nA passenger pointed out a bay, which he said was Roberts’ Cove, and\r\nrecommended the captain to run the vessel in there, as there was a boat\r\nharbour in it, and beach her. The captain said that he did not think there\r\nwas a harbour there—that, at all events, it would be impossible to make\r\nit. The vessel was all this time drifting nearer the rock on which she\r\nultimately struck; and in about an hour after the passenger had given the\r\nrecommendation alluded to, the captain got the vessel round, and\r\nendeavoured to make Roberts’ Cove. Just as he had got her before the wind,\r\nhowever, she was pooped by a tremendous sea, which carried away the\r\ntaffrail, staunchions, the wheel (and two men who worked it), the\r\ncompanion, the binnacle, and the breakwater. The two steersmen fortunately\r\ncaught part of the rigging, and were saved; but the sea which did the\r\ndamage carried away the bulwarks, with some of the steerage passengers,\r\nwho were standing near the funnel, and cleared the deck of all the pigs\r\nthat were on it.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of all the hands having endeavoured to save themselves, the\r\nvessel was left to herself, and continued to strike piecemeal on several\r\nminor rocks, as she was driven before the fury of the waves over them with\r\na clap—a crash resembling thunder—carrying off at each stroke one or more\r\nhuman beings, together with some portion of deck, deck furniture, deck\r\ntrimmings, rigging, &c. To hear the wrenching of the vessel, now between\r\nthe roaring billows and the rock, together with the cries of the\r\nsufferers, was soul-piercing in the extreme.\r\n\r\nIt was absurd to think, even for a moment, of lowering the quarter-boats,\r\nthe tempest raged so furiously. Previously to the vessel striking on the\r\nrock which rent her asunder, and upon which she went to pieces, passengers\r\nand seamen all ran up for self-preservation on the quarter-deck. A\r\nterrible rush was then made for this, their last resource; and catching\r\nhis child, Doctor Spolasco held him in his arms, and he clung close round\r\nhis neck with all the strength of his little embrace, looking imploringly\r\nin his face for protection, and, as if foreseeing his fate, said, “Papa,\r\nkiss me! Papa, kiss me! We are all lost!”\r\n\r\nThe last moment approached. The crisis was at hand. Struggling on with his\r\nbeloved charge, the doctor sprang forward with him, clasping him closely\r\nto his breast, and, creeping on his hand and knees, dragged his child\r\nalong under one arm, while he held by the fragments of the bulwarks,\r\nshifting his hand from splinter to splinter, until he slowly and gradually\r\nreached the stern, the heavens lowering, the tempest raging, and the\r\nbillows washing over them, drenched to the skin, and every instant gasping\r\nfor breath, the waves suffocating them, the billows every instant beating\r\nagainst them.\r\n\r\nSome time previously to this both passengers and crew knew not how to act\r\nor what to attempt to secure their safety, such was the distraction of\r\ntheir minds. The direction of the vessel was no longer thought of or\r\nattended to; each individual holding on by anything that he could possibly\r\ngrasp for temporary safety with one hand, while he was seen pulling off\r\nhis clothes with the other, in readiness to be freed from the encumbrance\r\nof them, that he might be enabled to make a last, a desperate effort to\r\nswim ashore.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed a struggle for life and death, but bordering so nearly on\r\nthe latter; some dressing again, and again undressing; again hesitating,\r\nfrantic and desperate, till not another moment was left for deliberation.\r\nCrash! crash! crash! came in awful quick succession, mingled with the\r\npiteous, the soul-harrowing cries, “For pity’s sake, help! help! help!”\r\n\r\nMore than half an hour previously to the vessel’s striking on that\r\nSaturday, between three and four in the afternoon, although instantly\r\nexpecting to go down, ten or twelve persons were seen on the neighbouring\r\nmountainous promontory, and it afforded them some glimmering of\r\nsatisfaction—some faint ray of hope that they would not perish in sight of\r\nland. They were observed as early as three o’clock on Saturday, but no\r\nefforts were made to rescue them till long after. A part of them gained\r\nthe rock on which the vessel struck previously to the night’s setting in,\r\nwhere they remained all Sunday and part of Monday, wet, cold, and nearly\r\nstarved.\r\n\r\n“I desired my child,” says Spolasco, “as he loved me, to cling close,\r\nwhile I went to render assistance to others, who were loudly imploring for\r\naid. The darling child, who was evidently sick and exhausted, obeyed; and\r\nI, alas! trusted to his puny strength to hold on.\r\n\r\n“I sat for a moment on the rock, kissing him, till I looked round and\r\nreflected on the awful scene before me, and beheld (with what emotion I\r\nleave you to guess) the dreadful destruction which was going on.\r\n\r\n“Previously to my jumping on the rock I observed Mrs. Lawe on the\r\nquarter-deck on her knees, frantic, without her cap, her hair dishevelled\r\nall around her shoulders, in dreadful anguish, striking the deck with one\r\nhand, while she held on with the other. Mr. Lawe, her husband, was at this\r\ntime drowned.\r\n\r\n“About this period the midships of the vessel were thrown by the terrific\r\nsea and raging storm into a position favourable for those yet on board to\r\nmake their escape upon the rock; thus it was with comparative ease the\r\nsurviving remnant on board now forsook the vessel.\r\n\r\n“In short, if the sufferers could have anticipated and waited for this\r\nopportunity, the lives of many who were lost might have been saved. They\r\nwould, at least, have been fortunate enough to have reached the rock, and\r\nwould have had the same chance of existence as others, provided their\r\nconstitution were sufficiently strong to bear the dreadful privations that\r\nthere awaited them.\r\n\r\n“I stretched forth my hand and assisted several as they approached, taking\r\nhold of the first that presented, making, of course, no distinction of\r\npersons, and continued to act thus till I saw a female in the last gasp,\r\nstill holding by the rock after the receding of a wave—it was Mrs. Lawe.\r\nThen, with all the force I could command, I dragged her forwards one or\r\ntwo paces. She was, indeed, poor good lady! in the last stage of\r\nexhaustion, and fell on my arm, and her weight caused me to slip, by which\r\nwe were both precipitated towards a frightful chasm; but luckily I again\r\nseized the rock ere the wave retired, or we might both have been swept\r\naway, and I held fast by one hand, while with the other I supported the\r\nlady, during which two or three waves washed over us. Neither she nor I\r\ncould breathe.\r\n\r\n“I collected all my remaining strength for this the last effort I was\r\nequal to in order to save her, and folding her in my arms, I crept up the\r\nrock quite above the surge, where the spray only could reach us.\r\n\r\n“She was speechless, but sufficiently sensible to acknowledge my attention\r\nwith looks of fervent gratitude. I then left her, anxious to return to my\r\nchild. But judge of my sensations—I found him not! He, alas! was gone! I\r\ncould not tell where, or what had become of him.” The poor boy had been\r\ndrowned, and no traces of him were ever discovered.\r\n\r\nTheir sufferings on the rock are well described:—“To such dreadful shifts\r\nwere we driven that during the night I was obliged to hold on with one\r\nhand, while with the other I grasped the hand of a fellow-sufferer, in\r\norder that each might receive some portion of vital heat; this we did\r\nalternately with right and left hand. But we were all so depressed in\r\nspirits and suffering so grievously from the cold and the rain as the\r\nnight advanced, that we did little else than turn our thoughts to the Most\r\nHigh, and calmly await the approach of day, and with it some hope of\r\nrelief. My face, nose, and particularly the inside of my mouth, were\r\ndreadfully mangled, and my teeth loosened, being so repeatedly forced by\r\nthe billows against the rock to which I was clinging. In short, I think no\r\nhuman endurance equalled ours; for towards morning, when my fingers became\r\nso benumbed from wet and cold that I lost the use of them, and I found\r\nthat it was impossible to hold on longer, I twice felt resigned to commit\r\nmyself to the deep, and was on the point of doing so, invoking Heaven to\r\nreceive my spirit.\r\n\r\n“The very lacerated state of my nose, mouth, and feet,” says the doctor,\r\n“when I was borne from the rock, were indicative of the sufferings I had\r\nendured. Poor M‘Arthur seemed either quite regardless of, or insensible\r\nto, my repeated warnings of his danger. He at last put his hands into the\r\npockets of his trousers, in spite of my remonstrances to the contrary. The\r\npoint of the rock on which he stood affording him a better foothold, or\r\nstanding, than mine, and that portion of the rock immediately before him\r\nnot being so perpendicular as that before me, allowed him to bend forward.\r\nThis last advantage, coupled with that of his better footing and his being\r\noverpowered with sleep, induced him to be so careless of his safety. But\r\nalmost instantly a fearful and tremendous sea struck the rock just below\r\nthe slight shelves or openings which supported our toes, and immediately\r\nrebounded over us many feet in height; then breaking and falling with\r\ngreat force on our heads, it had the effect of hurling off on the instant\r\npoor M‘Arthur. O gracious God, I never can be sufficiently grateful for\r\nThy bountiful goodness and singular preservation in protecting me through\r\nso many imminent perils, so many hair-breadth escapes! For of all the\r\npassengers with whom I dined on Friday in the steamer _Killarney_ I am the\r\nonly survivor! The cook who prepared the dinner, and the steward,\r\nsteward’s brother, and the stewardess that served it, are all in\r\neternity!”\r\n\r\nIt was not till about ten o’clock on the morning of Sunday that the poor\r\nsufferers on the rock endeavoured to change their positions, which was a\r\nmatter of some difficulty. One of the passengers, during the early part of\r\nthe night, having been unable to attain a position as comfortable as that\r\nof some of the rest, had hung on to Dr. Spolasco’s legs, in order to save\r\nhimself from dropping into the sea. Later a heavy wave struck him; he\r\nrelinquished his hold, and was swept into the sea never to rise again. “On\r\ngaining the summit,” says the doctor, “I perceived with horror that many\r\nhad disappeared during the night, and among them the lady whom I had\r\nrescued at the loss, I may indeed fairly say, of my dear boy.” There was a\r\ngeneral hope among the survivors that they would be rescued early that\r\nmorning (Sunday), and their disappointment that no effort was made to save\r\nthem was great indeed. They saw at an early hour hundreds of peasants on\r\nthe beach and cliff, some of them busily engaged at the wreckage or in\r\nbearing away parts of the pigs which had formed part of the cargo, but all\r\nintent upon gain. Not the slightest effort was made for the poor wretches\r\non the rock, although Spolasco at intervals waved his purse in one hand\r\nand his cap in another in order to induce the peasantry to afford\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nThe doctor endeavoured by signs to indicate that a raft could be easily\r\nconstructed from the wreckage, and that the drift of the current would\r\nbring it to the rock, but he was not understood. Again their hopes fell to\r\nzero. Poor M‘Arthur, the engineer, who had been nearly drowned before, had\r\nmanaged to struggle to a higher position on the rock, but he died from\r\nexhaustion early on Monday morning. Some time after, two men, and a little\r\nlater two boys, fell headlong into the sea, being nearly dead from\r\nstarvation and exposure. Of twenty-five who got safely on the rock,\r\nthirteen died before they could be rescued; and yet it was so near the\r\ncoast that those mounting the nearest cliff had to bend over its edge to\r\nsee it. Meantime the storm beat on violently, and no boat could have\r\napproached the rock. Sea-weed and salt water was all the food (!) they\r\ncould get from dinner hour on board the steamer on Friday, about five\r\no’clock, till Monday afternoon. All this within almost a stone’s throw of\r\nland!\r\n\r\n“To return,” says the narrator, “to Sunday. I have in a previous page\r\nstated that during the whole of the morning of that day, indeed up to the\r\nafternoon, all we saw was a crowd of peasants on the beach, each carrying\r\nhis or her burden from the spoils of the wreck of the steamer _Killarney_;\r\nand on the cliff above us, numbers—altogether amounting to some hundreds.\r\nIt was in vain we looked for some respectable person among them who would\r\nbe likely to tender us the desired assistance, till ... we hailed the\r\npresence of a respectable gentleman, by whose kind gestures we could\r\nunderstand (for it was impossible to hear his voice) that we yet should be\r\nsaved. After waving his hat, and doing all in his power to cheer us, he\r\nretired, and ascended the lofty cliff, and in a reasonable time afterwards\r\nagain returned, with several other gentlemen.\r\n\r\n“Several descended with him to the edge of the precipice—a dangerous\r\ndeclivity—bringing with them ropes, slings, &c., and indeed every other\r\nrequisite that the short period of their absence allowed them to procure,\r\nor whatever appeared to them necessary for the object they had in view.\r\nHaving arrived at the brink of the precipice, somewhat in a direct line\r\n(though still above us) with the rock upon which we were—the distance I\r\nwould compute to be from a hundred and fifty to two hundred feet—they\r\ncommenced throwing stones to which were attached small lines, several in\r\ntheir turn; one having failed, another tried, and so on, till they were\r\nsufficiently convinced that all such efforts were altogether fruitless—the\r\nstrongest of them not being able to pitch such stone more than half way\r\ntowards us.\r\n\r\n“Some one then suggested the propriety of trying slings, which they\r\nimmediately prepared—in turn taking off their cloaks, coats, &c., having\r\nfirst tied round their waist a strong rope as a prudent precaution of\r\nsecurity for their safety in making the bold attempt, viz., of slinging a\r\nstone, having attached to it a line, to us unfortunate expectants upon the\r\nrock. These efforts, too, like the former, were attended with want of\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\n“Mr. John Galwey, with whom was Mr. Edward Hull and other gentlemen,\r\napparently in a most perilous position confronting us, formed a footing\r\nwith crowbars, &c. Mr. Galwey was then observed several times to try to\r\npass a duck with a small line fastened to its leg, but without effect. We\r\nalso discerned him coiling a wire or line into the barrel of a musquet,\r\nwith the view of firing off the ball to which it was connected, hoping\r\nthat when the ball should have passed the rock the line might fall upon\r\nit. This expedient too was ingenious, but unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n“The next attempt for our rescue was thought of and entered upon by a\r\nbrave young gentleman, Richard Knolles, Esq.—son of the worthy Captain\r\nKnolles of that neighbourhood—by which he nearly lost his life. He had\r\nwith him a favourite dog, well trained to the water, and apparently to his\r\ncommand, with which fine animal he descended as nearly to the edge of the\r\nbeach as the billows, breakers, and foaming spray would allow him, and\r\nrather farther, for, being young, brave, and anxious to be the means of\r\nsaving us, he ventured somewhat too far for his safety, being met by a\r\ntremendous surf, which struck him, and dashed him above some twenty feet\r\nor more with such violence, that he was not only wetted to the skin, but\r\nhad the narrowest escape that man could well have of being lashed into the\r\nfurious sea and yawning gulf below him.”\r\n\r\nThe news of their cruel sufferings having ere this spread around the\r\ncountry—this being Sunday, and rather more favourable than the previous\r\ndays—thousands of both sexes assembled from miles around to witness the\r\nawful scene. They could clearly distinguish among the vast assemblage upon\r\nthe cliffs a great number of ladies by their veils, drapery, &c., who\r\ndoubtless had been attracted to the fatal spot through sympathy for their\r\npeculiar hardships. The shore appeared so near, and the day was so fine,\r\nthat through the greater part of it they did not think, nor could bring\r\nthemselves to believe it possible, that they were cruelly doomed to suffer\r\nanother night upon the desolate rock; and it was thought by some (seeing\r\nthat the distance to the cliff on the mainland was not very great) that a\r\nbrave plunge into the waves would bear them on shore.\r\n\r\n                [Illustration: THE SURVIVORS ON THE ROCK.]\r\n\r\nHunger was keen indeed; it was piercing; and perceiving the people upon\r\nthe cliff apparently unable to give them relief, one resolute but\r\nunfortunate man volunteered, and attempted to swim to shore, and, creeping\r\ndown the rock, bade them farewell. They wished him, with all their hearts,\r\nsuccess, each meaning to follow his example, if successful, rather than\r\nremain to perish on the rock. He rushed boldly into the surf; they all\r\nawaited his re-appearance with breathless anxiety, but he was rapidly\r\nhurried into the deep below, and they could discern him no more. All such\r\nattempts, or hope of such, to gain the shore by these means were then\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\nThe second night was now closing fast upon them, and having observed that\r\nsome preparations were being made on shore to extend ropes from promontory\r\nto promontory—a distance of from half a mile to a mile—they were all\r\nhovering between hope and fear. A deathless silence reigned among them.\r\nTheir gallant captain at length exclaimed, “I have it! They are carrying\r\none end of the line to yon jutting promontory (east), and are running with\r\nthe other end to the other promontory (west); the two ends of the line\r\nbeing drawn tight in opposite directions, the centre will overhang the\r\nrock, and be within our reach.” As the sequel proved, his judgment was\r\nwell founded.\r\n\r\n“We now,” says the narrator, “placed our whole reliance on the success of\r\nthe efforts of those on shore with the ropes; but the apparatus employed\r\nwas imperfect—time passing rapidly, and the night quickly approaching.\r\nJust at the commencement of dusk the rope reached us, which we were\r\nenabled to seize by a small tripping line that hung pendent from it when\r\nit was stretched over our heads, being drawn tight at each promontory by\r\nthe many assembled.” The captain, or some one of the men, caught the line\r\nand drew it downwards, when all seized it, and there was a wild huzza! The\r\ncaptain had been right in his conjecture. The line was extended from\r\nheadland to headland.\r\n\r\n“When the rope was conveyed to us,” writes the doctor, “we all cheered, as\r\nif re-animated by a new existence; and although it reached us too late to\r\nbe of any service on that night, such was our eagerness to be delivered\r\nfrom the rock, that one man volunteered, and immediately descended to the\r\nbase of it, and by a triangular knot made himself fast to the hawser,\r\nwhich had been conveyed to us by means of the small lines already alluded\r\nto. The rope, or hawser, although not a new one, I think was sufficiently\r\nstrong to bear one at a time to shore, and, indeed, up the lofty cliff, in\r\nsafety; but a boy who had been in care of the pigs, unfortunately, through\r\nover-anxiety to escape from the rock, descended, and most imprudently\r\nattached himself also at the same time to it, notwithstanding our earnest\r\nremonstrances to the contrary; and when they said ‘all was ready’—meaning\r\nthat they were secured to the rope—at the same time directing us to shout\r\nto those on the mainland ‘to pull them ashore,’ we did so, and they\r\nimmediately drew them towards the cliff, upon which we heard a splash, but\r\ncould see nothing, it being at this time dark.\r\n\r\n“During the night, when we occasionally conversed—for we had but little to\r\nsay, each being wrapped up in his own gloomy meditations—we felt a glow of\r\nsatisfaction that at last a contrivance had been resorted to by which two\r\nof us at least were rescued from spending another night upon the rock, we\r\nnot at this time at all considering that both had met a watery grave, for\r\nwe could see nothing—it was dark—neither could we hear anything, from the\r\nhowling of the storm and roaring of the tempest.\r\n\r\n“In the morning, however, in consequence of the rope having broken, we\r\nentertained a melancholy surmise of their unhappy fate; but upon landing,\r\nin the afternoon of Monday, we ascertained the piteous fact. It was\r\nrumoured, but it proved to be untrue, that the peasants, during the second\r\nnight (Sunday) of our dreadful suspense upon the rock, had cut the rope.\r\nThis arose in consequence of its having been found divided early on Monday\r\nmorning.”\r\n\r\nNext morning the good Samaritans ashore repaired to the scene, and eagerly\r\nscanned the rock, to see whether any still survived. Among them was Lady\r\nRoberts, who came with thirty of her men, with a car laden with ropes and\r\nother materials necessary for their deliverance. The first plan attempted\r\nearly on Monday morning was with Manby’s apparatus—_i.e._, firing a\r\ntwo-pound shot with a line attached from a howitzer. After many fruitless\r\nattempts this plan was relinquished. Slings, &c., were then tried, but\r\nwith the same result.\r\n\r\nDr. Spolasco took off his cap, and repeatedly waved it, in order to\r\nattract the observation of those on shore. Having succeeded, he raised his\r\nvoice and extended his arms, pointing to either promontory, and indicating\r\nthat unless they had recourse to Mr. Hull’s plan, as it was subsequently\r\nascertained to be, their fate would be decided. Fortunately he was\r\nunderstood, and the plan was prosecuted to its completion, all working\r\nwith a will. They again extended the lines from headland to headland, with\r\nthis variation only, that they now attached two tripping-lines instead of\r\none, hanging about a yard apart, and a weight to the end of each, which\r\nhad the desired effect of causing them to fall immediately over the rock.\r\nThey were immediately grasped; their hope of safety was fully revived, and\r\nthey again cheered with hopeful exultation. They retained a secure hold of\r\nthe centre of the line, while those upon the two cliffs proceeded to a\r\ncentre point on the mainland immediately opposite to them, and instantly\r\nattached the hawser to one end of the line in question. Having\r\naccomplished this, they made signs to those on the rock to draw towards\r\nthem the hawser, to which they had fastened a small basket containing a\r\nbottle of wine, a bottle of whisky, and some bread, the thoughtful gift of\r\nLady Roberts. The liquids proved invaluable, but as for the bread,\r\nexcepting a few crumbs, they could not swallow it. They had, from cold,\r\nexposure, and exhaustion, almost lost the power of mastication and\r\ndeglutition.\r\n\r\nThe basket also contained a written paper, instructing those on the rock\r\nthat, as the hawser was sufficiently long, to make it fast round the rock,\r\nthat it might be the more secure, and that they would pass a cot along it\r\nwith iron grummets. Having so fixed the cot, the signals were made to draw\r\nit towards the rock by means of the small line. The awful example afforded\r\non Monday morning, when it was perceived that the rope was broken,\r\nnaturally made several of them nervous now, and there was some hesitation\r\nas to who should enter it first to be drawn on shore, seeing that it had\r\nto be hauled a distance of sixty to a hundred feet above the level of the\r\nsea in order to land upon the lowest accessible part of the cliff, where\r\nMr. Hull, the inventor of the plan, was stationed to receive them. On\r\nlanding, they had to be carried to the summit of the nearly perpendicular\r\ncliff, about 300 feet, upon men’s backs, supported on either side by\r\nothers of their deliverers, for the least false step would have hurried\r\nthem headlong to the depths below.\r\n\r\nAfter some deliberation, the first to be placed in the cot was a woman\r\nnamed Mary Leary, who was assisted into it, and drawn through the air to\r\nwhat seemed a frightful height, amid the cheers of all. On her being\r\nlanded, the cot was again lowered to the rock, and the narrator of our\r\nstory entered it, lying upon his back. Giving the signal that he was\r\nready, those on the mainland pulled, and in a few minutes he was safe on\r\nthe cliff, where he received the warm congratulations of the gentlemen\r\nthere assembled. The ship’s carpenter, who was evidently very ill, was\r\nnext placed in the cot, but the poor fellow breathed his last almost\r\nimmediately after landing. The others soon followed, the captain, as\r\nshould be, being the last. Once ashore, they were treated with\r\nwarm-hearted hospitality, and a liberal subscription was raised for the\r\nsufferers of the crew and passengers, and the widows and orphans of those\r\nwho were lost. Of fifty persons who left Cork on the ill-fated\r\n_Killarney_, about twenty-five landed on the rock, and of these only\r\nfourteen reached land, one of them, as we have seen, to expire\r\nimmediately.\r\n\r\nThe mode by which the few survivors were rescued was so novel that it\r\ndeserves particular notice, and the following, quoted from a letter\r\nwritten by Mr. E. W. Hull to Baron Spolasco, will be found interesting.\r\n\r\n“The first intelligence my brother and myself received of the wreck was\r\nfrom Mr. John Galwey, at about nine or ten o’clock on Sunday morning. We\r\nimmediately proceeded towards the scene of the dreadful catastrophe, which\r\nis about five miles from Roberts’ Cove, and arrived there at eleven\r\no’clock. My brother’s men, of course, accompanied us. On our reaching the\r\nplace, I descended the frightful precipice, at the foot of which I\r\ndiscovered Mr. Galwey letting ducks fly with lines attached to them. I\r\njoined him in the experiment, though indeed I entertained not the least\r\nhope of its proving effective. We abandoned this plan, and having taken\r\noff my coat and hat, and placed a rope round my waist, to prevent my\r\nfalling over the lower cliff upon which we stood, I commenced using all\r\nthe means I could devise to convey a stone with a line attached to it to\r\nthe rock. I first made an effort to throw a stone from my hand; next, I,\r\nwith others, had recourse to slings; but all our experiments, as the\r\nsequel proved, were useless. I may here, without the least exaggeration,\r\nassert that the danger to which Mr. John Galwey, young Mr. Knolles, and\r\nmyself, were exposed was beyond the power of conception. Below us appeared\r\na hideous gulf, almost yawning to receive us from the cliff upon which we\r\nstood, while from above we saw large stones rolling down from a height of\r\ntwo hundred feet. To avoid being struck by these we had not the power of\r\nmoving an inch from the place in which we respectively stood; so that in\r\nthis, as in all other circumstances connected with our dangerous\r\nundertakings on the occasion, we were protected in our frightful situation\r\nby the peculiar interposition of Providence. We next had recourse to the\r\nplan of a person named Mills, of the Coastguard at Roberts’ Cove. It was\r\nthat of attaching wire to bullets, and firing them from guns. This plan\r\nlikewise proved unsuccessful.\r\n\r\n“At this time, when all our plans had become unavailing, those who had\r\nbeen acting with me below went to the top of the cliff. Being exceedingly\r\nexhausted I was unable to follow. I lay down on the brink of the\r\nprecipice, nearly on a line with the top of the rock upon which the\r\nsufferers were, and feeling as a human being should at so heartrending a\r\nspectacle, when all hope of saving a single individual was almost extinct.\r\nI exclaimed, ‘Good God! are there no means left to save them?’ At this\r\nmoment I took a view of the east promontory and the west. The thought—the\r\nhappy thought—flashed across my mind. I immediately perceived that\r\nProvidence favoured us with a tolerable certainty of success. I ascended\r\nthe precipice, and made my brother acquainted with my plan. We both\r\nsuggested it to others, but it was disregarded, owing to the great\r\ndistance between the promontories and the immense height of the cliffs.\r\nHowever, I saw a glorious prospect before me of rescuing my\r\nfellow-creatures from an awful death. Heaven inspired me with confidence,\r\nand, in conjunction with my brother, I could not be diverted from making a\r\ntrial. My brother and the neighbouring gentlemen sent in all directions\r\nfor lines and ropes. On getting them, we commenced putting my plan into\r\nexecution. The first attempt failed through want of sufficiency of rope\r\nand the setting in of night. When the rope was carried to the rock and\r\nthere secured, I perceived that one man got upon it. Had he alone\r\nventured, all would be right; but the eagerness of another poor fellow was\r\nso great that he attached himself to it, and the weight of the two was\r\novermuch for the rope to bear, and it consequently broke. How we felt at\r\nthis dreadful occurrence your readers may imagine; I cannot describe the\r\nfearful thrill of horror which pervaded every breast. It was now dark\r\nnight; we had therefore to discontinue our efforts until the next morning.\r\nWe left the lines during the intervening night as we had adjusted them the\r\nevening before. My brother left two of his men, with one of Lieutenant\r\nCharlesson’s, to preserve the rope and property during the night.\r\n\r\n       [Illustration: RESCUE OF THE SURVIVORS OF THE “KILLARNEY.”]\r\n\r\n“To return to the subject of my communication, I should state that, on\r\nascending the cliff I met Lady Roberts and Captain Knolles. I told them of\r\nthe loss of one man, not knowing at the time that a second had also\r\nsuffered—this information, indeed, I afterwards received from yourself. I,\r\nnotwithstanding this sad disaster, felt persuaded that if I had a\r\nsufficient quantity of rope all would be saved. I mentioned this to Lady\r\nRoberts, upon which her ladyship assured me that I should be plentifully\r\nsupplied with this article. Though painful to our feelings to be obliged\r\nto leave you to spend another night of gloom and horror, we were under the\r\nnecessity of doing so for want of a sufficient quantity of rope. On the\r\nfollowing morning (Monday) I arrived at the cliff, accompanied by my\r\nbrother and his men, an hour before daylight. The weather was dreadful\r\nbeyond conception, rain and snow falling incessantly. We immediately\r\nproceeded to bring into operation the plan of the former day. We were at\r\nthis time much better enabled to do so, having obtained a sufficiency of\r\nrope by the directions of Lady Roberts, who, to the honour of her sex, was\r\npresent at that early hour, exposed to the inclemency of the weather.\r\nLieutenant Irwin, Inspector of the Coastguard at Kinsale, arrived about\r\nthis time with Captain Manby’s apparatus. This gentleman, having, I\r\npresume, had some previous experience of the capability of similar\r\nmachines, commenced discharging balls from it. This suspended the\r\noperation of my plan for some time, but it was found altogether\r\nineffective; but I consider it right to state that no man could have\r\nmanifested a greater anxiety than Mr. Irwin to do good. The lines and\r\nropes which he brought us were essentially necessary in putting the\r\nsuccessful plan into execution; he also brought the cot....\r\n\r\n“In about two hours I had the satisfaction of seeing fourteen persons\r\nsafely landed from the rock, but one of them, I regret to say, died of\r\nexhaustion a short time after having been brought on shore.\r\n\r\n“The hawser, as you perceived, had to be taken down a precipice of nearly\r\nthree hundred feet. To the end of it was joined the line which you had\r\nprimarily received upon the rock, also a basket of refreshments. I myself\r\ntook it all down to the lower cliff, where I received each person on being\r\ndrawn from the rock. The dangers to which myself and three of the\r\ncoastguard were exposed on that occasion were not, I assure you,\r\ntrifling.”\r\n\r\nAbout a fortnight after the wreck of the _Killarney_, a large portion of\r\nthe rock upon which the remnant of the crew and passengers had suffered so\r\nmuch was carried away in a storm. It is worthy of remark that during the\r\nAmerican War a vessel conveying a company and band of the 32nd Regiment of\r\nFoot was lost on the same rock, when all perished.\r\n\r\nThere can be no doubt that a life-boat, had there been one, would have\r\nrescued many more of the poor unfortunates, left on the rock from Friday\r\nafternoon to Monday afternoon, with considerable ease. During the year\r\n1876-77, not very far from _five thousand_ lives were saved by the fleet\r\nof 269 boats of the National Life-boat Institution. Let us examine the\r\nwreck record of that period.(100)\r\n\r\nWe find that the number of British vessels which entered and cleared from\r\nports of the United Kingdom during the year in question was 581,099,\r\nrepresenting the enormous tonnage of 101,799,050. Of these ships, 224,669\r\nwere steamers, having a tonnage of about two-thirds of the above amount.\r\nDuring the same period 60,000 foreign vessels entered inwards and cleared\r\noutwards from British ports, representing a tonnage of nearly 20,000,000.\r\nThese 641,099 ships, British and foreign, had probably on board, _apart\r\nfrom passengers_, 4,000,000 men and boys.\r\n\r\nIn 1876-77 the number of wrecks, casualties, and collisions, from all\r\ncauses, on and near the coasts of the United Kingdom, was 4,164, which\r\nnumber exceeds that of the previous year by 407. 511 cases out of this\r\nlarge number involved total loss, 502 and 472 representing the same class\r\nof calamities for the two preceding years.\r\n\r\nDuring the past twenty years-from 1857 to 1876-77—the number of shipwrecks\r\non our coasts alone has averaged 1,948 a year, representing in money value\r\nmillions upon millions sterling in the aggregate.\r\n\r\n“In making this statement,” says _The Life-boat_, “we lay aside entirely\r\nthe thousands of precious lives, on which no money value could be placed,\r\nwhich were sacrificed on such disastrous occasions, and which would have\r\nbeen enormously increased in the absence of the determined and gallant\r\nservices of the life-boats of the National Life-boat Institution.\r\n\r\n“In the Abstract of the Wreck Register it is stated that, between 1861 and\r\n1876-77, the number of ships, both British and foreign, wrecked on our\r\ncoasts which were attended with loss of life was 2,784, causing the loss\r\nof 13,098 persons. In 1876-77, loss of life took place in one out of every\r\ntwenty-two shipwrecks on our coasts.\r\n\r\n“It is hardly necessary to say that gales of wind are the prime causes of\r\nmost shipwrecks, and that those of 1876-77 will long be remembered for\r\ntheir violence and destructive character. Of the 4,164 wrecks, casualties,\r\nand collisions, reported as having occurred on and near the coasts of the\r\nUnited Kingdom during the year 1876-77, we find that the total comprised\r\n5,017 vessels. Thus, the number of ships in 1876-77 is more than the total\r\nin 1875-76 by 463. The number of ships reported is in excess of the\r\ncasualties reported, because in cases of collision two or more ships are\r\ninvolved in one casualty. Thus, 847 were collisions, and 3,317 were wrecks\r\nand casualties other than collisions. Of these latter casualties, 446 were\r\nwrecks, &c., resulting in total loss, 902 were casualties resulting in\r\nserious damage, and 1,969 were minor accidents. The whole number of wrecks\r\nand casualties other than collisions on and near our coasts reported\r\nduring the year 1875-76 was 2,982, or 335 less than the number reported\r\nduring the twelve months under discussion.\r\n\r\n“The localities of the wrecks, still excluding collisions, are thus\r\ngiven:—East coasts of England and Scotland, 1,140; south coast, 630; west\r\ncoast of England and Scotland, and coast of Ireland, 1,259; north coast of\r\nScotland, 129; and other parts, 159. Total, 3,317.” “It is recorded that\r\nthe greatest destruction of human life happened on the north and east\r\ncoasts of England and Scotland.”\r\n\r\nIt is interesting to observe the ages of the vessels which were wrecked\r\nduring the period under consideration. Excluding foreign ships and\r\ncollision cases, 221 wrecks and casualties happened to nearly new ships,\r\nand 396 to ships from 3 to 7 years of age. Then there are wrecks and\r\ncasualties to 631 ships from 7 to 14 years old, and to 907 from 15 to 30\r\nyears old. Then follow 459 old ships from 30 to 50 years old. Having\r\npassed the service of half a century, we come to the very old ships, viz.,\r\n71 between 50 and 60 years old, 33 from 60 to 70, 24 from 70 to 80, 9 from\r\n80 to 90, and 5 from 90 to 100, while the ages of 68 of the wrecks are\r\nunknown.\r\n\r\nOn distinguishing these last named casualties near the coasts of the\r\nUnited Kingdom, according to the force of the wind at the time at which\r\nthey happened, we find that 739 happened with the wind at forces 7 and 8,\r\nor a moderate to fresh gale, when a ship, if properly found, manned, and\r\nnavigated, can keep the sea with safety; and that 1,046 happened with the\r\nwind at force 9 and upwards, that is to say, from a strong gale to a\r\nhurricane.\r\n\r\n“We must say one word on the subject of casualties to our ships in our\r\nrivers and harbours, as the fearful calamity to the steamer _Princess\r\nAlice_ last September in the Thames has directed afresh intense attention\r\nto them throughout the civilised world. We find from the Wreck Register\r\nAbstract that the total number during the year 1876-77 was 984, of which\r\n17 were total losses, 245 were serious casualties, and 722 minor\r\ncasualties.\r\n\r\n“Of these casualties, collisions numbered 658, founderings 13, strandings\r\n184, and miscellaneous 129.\r\n\r\n“These 984 casualties caused the loss of or damage to 1,725 vessels, of\r\nwhich 1,020 were British sailing-vessels, 560 British steam-vessels, 118\r\nforeign sailing-vessels, and 27 foreign steam-vessels. The lives lost in\r\nthese casualties were 15.\r\n\r\n“With reference to the collisions on and near our coasts during the year\r\n1876-77, 48 of the 847 collisions were between two steamships both under\r\nway, irrespective of numerous other such cases in our harbours and rivers,\r\nthe particulars of which are not given in the Abstract. No disaster at sea\r\nor in a river is often more awful in its consequences than a collision, as\r\nwas too strikingly illustrated last year in the cases of the German\r\nironclad _Grosser Kurfürst_, and the Thames steamer _Princess Alice_.\r\n\r\n“As regards the loss of life, the Wreck Abstract shows that the number was\r\n776, and of these 92 were lost in vessels that foundered, 57 through\r\nvessels in collision, 470 in vessels stranded or cast ashore, and 93 in\r\nmissing vessels. The remaining number of lives lost (64) were lost from\r\nvarious causes, such as through being washed overboard in heavy seas,\r\nexplosions, missing vessels, &c.\r\n\r\n“This number (776) may appear to the casual observer a comparatively small\r\none by the side of the thousands who escaped disaster from the numerous\r\nshipwrecks before mentioned. We are, however, of opinion that it is a very\r\nlarge number; and when we bear in mind the inestimable value of human\r\nlife, we are convinced that no effort should be left untried which can in\r\nany way lessen the annual loss of life from shipwreck on our coasts.\r\n\r\n“On the other hand, great and noble work was accomplished during the same\r\nperiod, 4,795 lives having been saved from the various shipwrecks. In\r\nbringing about that most important service, it is hardly necessary to say\r\nthat the craft of the National Life-boat Institution played a most\r\nimportant part, in conjunction with the Board of Trade’s rocket apparatus,\r\nwhich is so efficiently worked by the Coastguard and our Volunteer\r\nBrigades.\r\n\r\n“Nevertheless, the aggregate loss of life is very large, and so is the\r\naggregate destruction of property. The former is a species of woe\r\ninflicted on humanity; the latter is practically a tax upon commerce.\r\nWhile the art of saving life on the coasts is understood (thanks to the\r\nprogress of science—the earnestness of men—and the stout hearts of our\r\ncoast population), the art of preserving property is as yet but\r\nimperfectly known amongst us, and still more imperfectly practised.\r\n\r\n“On reviewing the Wreck Register Abstract of the past year, we are bound\r\nto take courage from the many gratifying facts it reveals in regard to\r\nsaving life, which, after all, is our principal object in commenting upon\r\nit. Noble work has been done, and is doing, for that purpose; and is it\r\nnot something, amidst all this havoc of the sea, to help to save even one\r\nlife, with all its hopes, and to keep the otherwise desolate home\r\nunclouded?”\r\n\r\nAmong the useful works undertaken by the National Life-boat Institution is\r\nthe discussion in its journal of all matters connected with the art of\r\nswimming, and swimming and floating apparatus. The Society also issues a\r\nvaluable circular on the “Treatment of the apparently Drowned,” to which\r\nfurther allusion will be hereafter made. The writer is so satisfied that\r\nno humane or charitable institution in the wide world is better or more\r\neconomically managed than that under notice, that he would urge all\r\nreaders of THE SEA to contribute to its funds. And although every reader\r\nmay not be able to afford his guinea or guineas, he can contribute his\r\nshillings or half-crowns, and his influence in aiding one of the local\r\nbranches, or in forming new ones. A number of life-boats stationed on\r\nvarious parts of the coasts were the gifts of other associations and\r\nbodies. The Civil Service, Corn Exchange, Coal Exchange, Freemasons, Odd\r\nFellows, Foresters, Good Templars, and other orders, have contributed\r\nnobly. Several boats and stations, generally named after the particular\r\nfund, were contributed by London and other Sunday-schools, Jewish\r\nscholars, commercial travellers, workmen, yacht, boat, and other clubs;\r\nwhile three were the result of an appeal to the readers of the Quiver, two\r\nare credited to the _Dundee People’s Journal_, and one each to the\r\n_British Workman_ and _English Mechanic_. And in concluding the second\r\nvolume of THE SEA, the writer considers that he has a special right to\r\nurge the claims of the Society on his readers, the subject-matter of its\r\npages being taken into account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                            END OF VOLUME II.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n        CASSELL PETTER & GALPIN, BELLE SAUVAGE WORKS, LONDON, E.C.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                FOOTNOTES\r\n\r\n\r\n    1 “Select observations of the incomparable Sir Walter Raleigh relating\r\n      to trade,” as presented to King James.\r\n\r\n    2 “History of Merchant Shipping and Ancient Commerce.”\r\n\r\n    3 Monson’s “Naval Tracts” in Churchill’s “Collection.” Most of the\r\n      narrative to follow is taken from the same source.\r\n\r\n    4 Charnock, “History of Naval Architecture.”\r\n\r\n    5 This contemptuous allusion refers of course to the tobacco brought\r\n      from the newly-formed plantations in Virginia.\r\n\r\n    6 Macaulay: “History of England.”\r\n\r\n    7 The term “America” often included the West Indies, &c., at that\r\n      period.\r\n\r\n    8 The principal authorities are—“The History of Peter the Great, &c.,”\r\n      by Alexander Gordon, who was several years a major-general in the\r\n      Russian service, and was son-in-law of the General Patrick Gordon\r\n      who may be said to have once saved Russia to the Czar; “Histoire de\r\n      Pierre le Grand,” by Voltaire; and the “Life of Peter the Great,” by\r\n      John Barrow, F.R.S., &c.

The answer was characteristic, and the feeling it\r\n      expressed so strong and natural that I have never forgotten it.\r\n      ‘Don’t talk to me about iron ships, _it’s contrary to nature_.’\r\n      There was at one time almost as great a prejudice against Indian\r\n      teak as a material for shipbuilding, as this wood is heavier than\r\n      water, and, in the form of a log, will not float.”\r\n\r\n   32 The above account is derived from Lindsay.\r\n\r\n   33 See _Annual Register_, 1854, p. 162.\r\n\r\n   34 The _Times_, November 17th, 1875.\r\n\r\n   35 “Our Seamen: an Appeal.”\r\n\r\n   36 An excess of that very aliment, the absence of which produces\r\n      scurvy, will also induce disease. Thus, the negroes of the West\r\n      Indies live too exclusively on vegetables, and disease follows, the\r\n      remedy for which is usually _red herrings_—herrings salted and\r\n      smoked till they are as red as copper.\r\n\r\n   37 The _Times_, January 14th, 1867.\r\n\r\n   38 “English Seamen and Divers.”\r\n\r\n   39 Frederick Martin: “The History of Lloyd’s and of Marine Insurance in\r\n      Great Britain.”\r\n\r\n   40 The term is applied exclusively to maritime insurers, although,\r\n      strictly speaking, anyone signing a bond is an underwriter.\r\n\r\n   41 See Lindsay’s “History of Merchant Shipping,” Timbs’ “Year Book of\r\n      Facts in Science and Art,” and Irving’s “Annals of Our Times.” She\r\n      is still nearly _five_ times the size of any merchant vessel afloat;\r\n      as we have seen, the Inman steamer, _City of Berlin_ (5,500 tons),\r\n      comes next to her. There are ironclads nearly half her tonnage.\r\n\r\n   42 One account says a “ferry-boat,” meaning probably one of the large\r\n      steam ferry-boats common in America.\r\n\r\n   43 “Sunning” means, in some parts of Canada, the act of promenading.\r\n\r\n   44 The larger part of the above information is derived from “Our\r\n      Ironclad Ships,” by E.

The writer while in California\r\n      witnessed some experiments with it, which are indelibly written on\r\n      his brain. A mortar was set upright in the field appropriated for\r\n      the exhibition, and several pounds of ordinary powder having been\r\n      rammed down, a large cannon-ball was put in and the charge fired.\r\n      The ball was raised a foot or so, and then tumbled to the ground. A\r\n      few _ounces_ of dynamite and the same ball were placed in the\r\n      mortar, and the charge exploded by concussion. The cannon-ball was\r\n      projected upwards in the air several hundred feet. It will be\r\n      imagined that the writer and his friends scattered in all\r\n      directions, and watched very carefully the downward flight of the\r\n      ball.\r\n\r\n   51 “The Gun, Ram, and Torpedo.” (Prize Essay written for the Junior\r\n      Naval Professional Association, 1874.)

It is reported\r\n      that, in old times, there was upon the said rock a bell, fixed upon\r\n      a tree or timber, which rang continually, being moved by the sea,\r\n      giving notice to the saylors of the danger. This bell or clocke was\r\n      put there by the Abbot of Arberbrothok, and being taken down by a\r\n      sea-pirate, a year thereafter he perished upon the same rock, with\r\n      ship and goodes, by the righteous judgment of God.” (Stoddart’s\r\n      “Remarks on Scotland.”)\r\n\r\n   57 “Account of the Skerryvore Lighthouse, with Notes on the\r\n      Illumination of Lighthouses,” by Alan Stevenson.\r\n\r\n   58 “A Rudimentary Treatise on the History, Construction, and\r\n      Illumination of Lighthouses.” (Weale’s Series.)\r\n\r\n_   59 Vide_ “The Rambles of a Naturalist on the Coasts of France, Spain,\r\n      and Sicily.”\r\n\r\n   60 M.

It\r\n      is to be noted that Winstanley’s house, at Littlebury, in Essex, 200\r\n      miles from the lighthouse, fell down and was utterly destroyed in\r\n      the same storm.\r\n\r\n   68 This narrative differs from the more circumstantial account given by\r\n      Defoe, doubtless from official authorities. The vessel had seventy\r\n      guns, and 349 men; the latter, likely enough, may not have been her\r\n      full complement.\r\n\r\n   69 A large part of the information incorporated above is derived from\r\n      one of the least known of Defoe’s works, entitled, “The Storm: or, a\r\n      Collection of the most Remarkable Casualities and Disasters which\r\n      happened in the Late Dreadful Tempest, both by Sea and Land.”\r\n\r\n   70 Although so severe in England and a large part of the Continent,\r\n      Scotland scarce felt the fury of the gale. Defoe, in his poem on the\r\n      subject, says:—\r\n\r\n        “They tell us Scotland ’scaped the blast;\r\n          No nation else have been without a taste:\r\n        All Europe sure have felt the mighty shock,\r\n          ’T has been a universal stroke.\r\n        But heaven has other ways to plague the Scots,\r\n          As poverty and plots.”\r\n\r\n   71 “History of the Life-boat and its Work,” by Richard Lewis, of the\r\n      Inner Temple, Esq., Secretary of the National Life-boat Institution.\r\n\r\n   72 Including the grand name of William Wilberforce.\r\n\r\n   73 Its revenue is now approximately ten times the above amount.\r\n\r\n   74 For the perilous nature of the employment, the pay is ridiculously\r\n      small.

(Organ of the “Shipwrecked Mariner’s Society.”) The article is\r\n      from the pen of Lindon Saunders, Esq.\r\n\r\n_   79 The Life-boat: a Journal of the Life-boat Institution._ November\r\n      2nd, 1874.\r\n\r\n   80 The following account is based mainly on the reports published in\r\n      the _Times_.\r\n\r\n   81 A part of the crew behaved in a most cowardly manner, and thought\r\n      only of saving themselves, although Captain Knowles and Mr. Brand,\r\n      the chief officer, who stood nobly by their posts, did all in their\r\n      power to shame these recreants, and themselves went down with the\r\n      ship. The lines quoted above were written by a graduate of Pembroke\r\n      College, Cambridge, whose promising career was cut short by death at\r\n      an early age. The poem, described as “A Fragment,” is given in full\r\n      in _The Lifeboat_ for February 1st, 1878.\r\n\r\n   82 Vide _The Life-boat; or, Journal of the National Life-boat\r\n      Institution_. August 2, 1875.\r\n\r\n   83 The Scilly Islands, thirty miles from the Land’s End, are 140 in\r\n      number, and range in extent from one to 1,600 acres, several of the\r\n      larger being fully inhabited. They are flanked by the grandest rock\r\n      scenery, and surrounded by reefs and rocks innumerable.\r\n\r\n   84 Captain Thomas had, we were told on other authority, navigated the\r\n      _Schiller_ across the Atlantic and past the treacherous Scillies\r\n      eight times. He imagined himself to be far from a point of danger;\r\n      and old sea-captains assert that it is not uncommon for a vessel to\r\n      be in advance of her commander’s calculations—in other words, she\r\n      may plough through the water faster than he is aware. In this case\r\n      the sun had been absent for three days, and the course had been kept\r\n      by dead reckoning.\r\n\r\n_   85 The Lifeboat_, &c., February 1st, 1876.\r\n\r\n   86 Shortly after the wreck of the _Deutschland_, the same tug-boat, the\r\n      _Liverpool_, rescued from certain death the crew of another foreign\r\n      ship, this time a Norwegian vessel, wrecked on the Ship-wash\r\n      sandbank; and the Ramsgate life-boat, summoned by telegram from\r\n      Harwich, was towed by the steam-tug _Aid_ no less than forty-five\r\n      miles to the scene of the disaster—only to find on arrival there\r\n      that the shipwrecked crew had already been saved by the Harwich\r\n      tug—and then another forty-five miles on her return. The fifteen\r\n      poor fellows on board had then been fourteen hours sitting in their\r\n      boat, with the seas and spray breaking over them through the whole\r\n      of this terrible voyage in a freezing atmosphere. They landed in a\r\n      benumbed and half-frozen state, from the effects of which some of\r\n      them were sure to suffer severely afterwards.\r\n\r\n_   87 The Lifeboat_, &c., Feb. 1st, 1876.\r\n\r\n   88 “The Loss of the _Amazon_.” By the Rev. C. A. Johns, B.A., F.L.S.,\r\n      &c.\r\n\r\n   89 In sea-going steam-vessels the salt water employed in the boilers\r\n      incrusts the sides with a deposit of salt, and it is necessary to\r\n      “blow off” every now and again, and discharge the water from them.\r\n\r\n   90 Eliot Warburton, the author of “The Crescent and the Cross,” &c.,\r\n      &c.\r\n\r\n   91 “The _Amazon_:” A sermon preached at St. Andrew’s Church, Plymouth,\r\n      January 18th, 1852, by the Rev. William Blood (one of the\r\n      survivors).\r\n\r\n   92 This is common enough in all the great steamship lines, where\r\n      certain vessels acquire a name for speed and accommodation, and\r\n      where the captain is known as a first-class commander. Passengers\r\n      who can afford to wait often delay their trips for weeks for the\r\n      opportunity of sailing on a favourite ship.\r\n\r\n   93 The Rev. D. J. Draper, a man of fifty-six years of age, was\r\n      returning to Australia, where for thirty years he had laboured as a\r\n      missionary, and where he was very generally and deservedly\r\n      respected. Part of the information respecting the wreck is taken\r\n      from “The Storm and the Haven,” a tribute to his memory, published\r\n      in Melbourne the year of the terrible occurrence.\r\n\r\n   94 The official inquiry of the Board of Trade elicited the fact that\r\n      the number was somewhat smaller. The total number of souls on board\r\n      was 263, and of these 19 were saved, leaving the number who perished\r\n      at 244.\r\n\r\n   95 It is a fact that Captain Martin had an interest in the _London_ to\r\n      the extent of £5,000. Hard to lose life and property so valuable—may\r\n      be, so important to others at home—at one and the same time!\r\n\r\n   96 The above account is principally derived from a “Narrative of the\r\n      Loss of the _Rothsay Castle_,” by Lieut. R. J. Morrison, R.N., and\r\n      other sources.\r\n\r\n   97 The writer has seen nearly the same thing practised on the\r\n      flat-bottomed stern-wheel steamers common in some parts of America,\r\n      where, in shallow water, the passengers have been required to walk\r\n      to the other side of the vessel, and literally “tip” her on that\r\n      side. On one occasion in a “slough,” or shallow passage, he saw a\r\n      number of the passengers and crew literally step out into the water\r\n      and push the boat along, till, with their exertions and the\r\n      steam-power, she was got off the bank.\r\n\r\n_   98 Vide_ “Letters, &c., on the Loss of the _Rothsay Castle_.” By the\r\n      Rev.
