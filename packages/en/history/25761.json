In default of a\r\nbetter word we may call the movement a Reformation, though it might\r\nperhaps be more accurately described as an ecclesiastical revolution.\r\nWithout some knowledge of its aims and progress it is impossible to\r\nassign to Malachy his true place in the history of his native country.\r\n\r\nThat such a movement actually took place in the twelfth century is\r\nbeyond doubt. From about the year 1200 on it is certain that the\r\norganization of the Church of Ireland was similar to that of the other\r\nChurches of western Christendom. The country was divided into dioceses;\r\nand each diocese had a bishop as its ruler, and a Cathedral Church in\r\nwhich the bishop's stool was placed. The Cathedral Church, moreover, had\r\na chapter of clergy, regular or secular, who performed important\r\nfunctions in the diocese. But up to the end of the eleventh century all\r\nthese things were unknown among the Irish. The constitution of the\r\nChurch was then of an entirely different type, one that had no exact\r\nparallel elsewhere. The passage from the older to the newer organization\r\nmust have taken place in the twelfth century. During that century,\r\ntherefore, there was a Reformation in the Irish Church, however little\r\nwe may know of its causes or its process. But this Reformation was no\r\nmere re-modelling of the hierarchy. It can be shown that it imposed on\r\nthe members of the Church a new standard of sexual morality; if we\r\nbelieve contemporary writers, it restored to their proper place such\r\nrites as Confession, Confirmation and Matrimony; it substituted for the\r\noffices of divine service previously in use those of the Roman Church;\r\nit introduced the custom of paying tithes; it established in Ireland the\r\nmonastic orders of Latin Christendom[1]; and it may have produced\r\nchanges in other directions.[2] But I propose to confine myself to the\r\nchange in the constitution of the Church, which was its most striking\r\nfeature. The subject, even thus narrowed, will give us more than can be\r\nsatisfactorily treated in a few pages.\r\n\r\nFirst, I must emphasize the assertion made a moment ago that the\r\nconstitution of the Irish Church in the eleventh century was _sui\r\ngeneris_. Let us begin by reminding ourselves what it was from the sixth\r\nto the eighth century. It was then essentially monastic in character.\r\nThe rulers of the Church were the abbots of the monasteries, commonly\r\nknown as the coarbs or successors of their founders. These abbots were\r\nsometimes bishops; but whether they were bishops or of lower rank in the\r\nministry, their authority was inherent in their office of coarb. At this\r\nperiod bishops were numerous--more numerous than in later medieval or\r\nmodern times; and certain functions were reserved for bishops, for\r\nexample, ordination. No ecclesiastic, of whatever status, could perform\r\nsuch functions, unless he was of the episcopal order. But no bishop, as\r\nsuch, had jurisdiction. The bishops were often subordinate officers in\r\nmonasteries, reverenced because of their office, but executing their\r\nspecial functions at the command of the abbots. Sometimes a bishop was\r\nattached to a single tribe. Sometimes a group of bishops--often seven in\r\nnumber--dwelt together in one place. But in no case, I repeat, had they\r\njurisdiction. Thus ecclesiastical authority was vested in the abbots.\r\nThe episcopate was bestowed on certain individuals as a personal\r\ndistinction. Thus the bishops, if they were not also abbots, had only\r\nsuch influence on the affairs of the Church as their sanctity, or their\r\nlearning, might give them.\r\n\r\nIt may surprise some that so anomalous a system of government should\r\nhave persisted as late as the eleventh century, in other words for a\r\nperiod of over 500 years. But we must take account of the Danish--or as\r\nwe should rather call it, the Norse--invasion of Ireland. Danish ships\r\nfirst appeared off the Irish coasts about the year 800. From that time\r\nfor two centuries Ireland was to a large extent cut off from intercourse\r\nwith the rest of Europe. The aim of the northern hordes, as it seems,\r\nwas not mere pillage, but the extinction of Christianity. Ecclesiastical\r\ninstitutions were everywhere attacked, and often destroyed. And these\r\ninstitutions were centres of scholarship. Heretofore Ireland had been\r\nthe special home of learning, and had attracted to itself large numbers\r\nof foreign students. But in those disastrous centuries its culture was\r\nreduced to the lowest point. In such circumstances it was not possible\r\nthat the organization of the Church should be developed or strengthened.\r\nThe Danish domination of the country must have tended to stereotype the\r\nold hierarchical system. It might, indeed, suffer from deterioration: it\r\nprobably did. But it could not be assimilated to the system which then\r\nprevailed on the Continent. We should expect that the constitution of\r\nthe Church in the eleventh century, whatever abuses may have crept into\r\nits administration, would in principle be identical with that of the\r\npre-Danish period.\r\n\r\nThere can in fact be no doubt that it was. We have in our hands writings\r\nof Lanfranc, Anselm, St. Bernard and Giraldus Cambrensis which picture\r\nthe state of the Irish Church at that time. They speak of it in terms\r\nwhich are by no means complimentary. But when they come to details we\r\ndiscover that the irregularities in its hierarchical arrangement which\r\nshocked them most went back to the days of St. Columba. Quotations\r\ncannot be given here. But the reader will probably find in the Life\r\nprinted below, and the authorities referred to in the notes, sufficient\r\nproof that the constitution of the Irish Church in 1100 was in the main\r\na following, though perhaps a corrupt following, of that of the sixth\r\ncentury.[3]\r\n\r\nThere was indeed one abuse in the Irish Church of the tenth and eleventh\r\ncenturies of which few traces are found before the Danish invasion. We\r\nlearn from St. Bernard that the abbots of Armagh were the\r\nrepresentatives of a single family, and held office, as of right, by\r\nhereditary succession.[4] There is reason to believe that this evil\r\ncustom was not peculiar to Armagh.[5] According to St. Bernard, it was\r\nthe gravest departure from Catholic tradition of which the Irish Church\r\nwas guilty, and the parent of many evils. We shall hear more of it in\r\nthe sequel. For the moment it is sufficient to note that it existed.\r\n\r\n\r\nI.--The Beginnings of the Movement\r\n\r\nBut before the eleventh century ended forces were at work in Ireland\r\nwhich prepared the way for the introduction of a new order. They were\r\nset free by the conversion of the Norsemen to Christianity, and by their\r\nfinal defeat at the battle of Clontarf. The date of the conversion\r\ncannot be fixed: it was probably a gradual process. And we do not know\r\nfrom what source the Danes derived their Christianity. The victory of\r\nClontarf was won on Good Friday, 1014.\r\n\r\nNow a study of the Annals reveals the fact that in the seventh and\r\neighth centuries there was a goodly, and on the whole an increasing,\r\nbody of scholars in Ireland. Under the Norse domination, as we might\r\nexpect, the number was greatly diminished. But already in the tenth\r\ncentury there was a notable increase: in the eleventh century the number\r\nwas doubled. In the tenth century, moreover, and still more in the\r\neleventh, scholars began to congregate at special centres, which became\r\npermanent homes of learning, the most prominent of these schools being\r\nat Armagh and Clonmacnoise. And during the same period we find frequent\r\nmention of an official, unknown before the arrival of the Norsemen, who\r\nis styled _fer légind_ or professor. Between 925 and 1000 the obits of\r\ntwenty-three professors are recorded; in the eleventh century of more\r\nthan fifty. In the greater number of cases the _fer légind_ is\r\nassociated with one of those seats of learning which is known to have\r\nbeen most prolific of scholars.\r\n\r\nThus it appears that gradually, as the onslaughts of the Danes became\r\nless frequent, Irish men of learning tended more and more to become\r\nteachers rather than mere students, and to gravitate towards a few great\r\ncentres of study. The climax of this movement towards organization and\r\nthe eminence of special places was reached about the middle of the\r\neleventh century (1030-1063), when mention is made of thirty-three\r\npersons who held the office of _fer légind_, and when the principal\r\nschools seem to have been those of Clonmacnoise, Armagh, Kildare and\r\nKells.[6]\r\n\r\nThe Reformation of the twelfth century, like that of the sixteenth, was\r\nprepared for by a revival of learning.\r\n\r\nBut further, the defeat of the Danes removed the barrier which had\r\nhindered communication between Ireland and the rest of Europe. Students\r\nonce more came to Ireland from other lands to pursue their studies. The\r\nmost remarkable of these was perhaps Sulien, the future bishop of St.\r\nDavid's. Sulien the Wise was born shortly before the date of the battle\r\nof Clontarf in the district of Cardigan. In early youth he displayed\r\nmuch aptitude for learning, and in middle life, about 1058, \"stirred by\r\nthe example of the fathers,\" he paid a visit to the Irish schools in\r\norder to perfect his studies. He spent thirteen years in that country,\r\nand then established a famous school at Llanbadarn Fawr in Wales. In the\r\nlibrary of Trinity College, Dublin, there is a precious relic of the\r\nwork of this school. It is a beautiful manuscript of St. Jerome's Latin\r\nversion of the Psalter according to the Hebrew, once the property of\r\nBishop Bedell.[7] The manuscript was written by a member of the school,\r\na Welshman named Ithael. It is adorned with excellent illuminations by\r\nJohn, one of Sulien's sons, and was presented to Ricemarch, another son\r\nof Sulien. A valuable copy of the Hieronymian Martyrology prefixed to it\r\ngives sundry indications that it was transcribed from an Irish\r\nexemplar. At the end of the volume are some verses composed by\r\nRicemarch, and perhaps written there by his own hand. They display\r\nconsiderable Biblical and patristic learning. Another relic of the\r\nschool is a copy of St. Augustine's _De Trinitate_ in Corpus Christi\r\nCollege, Cambridge.[8] It was written and illuminated by John, and\r\ncontains excellent Latin verses from his pen. In the British Museum\r\nthere is also a poem of Ricemarch describing the horrors of the Norman\r\ninvasion of Wales.[9] And finally we have a _Life of St. David_, by the\r\nsame author. It relates many incidents culled from the lives of Irish\r\nsaints who had in one way or another been brought into contact with\r\nDavid; all of them reminiscent of Sulien's studies in the Irish\r\nSchools.[10]\r\n\r\nI have dwelt on these things because they illustrate in a striking way\r\nthe revival of Irish learning in the eleventh century. But just at the\r\ntime when Sulien, and doubtless many other foreigners, were coming to\r\nIreland to study, Irish scholars were beginning to renew their ancient\r\nhabit of travelling to other countries. By way of example I may mention\r\ntwo, both of whom were known by the same name, Marianus Scotus. One of\r\nthese, a native of the north of Ireland, whose real name was Muiredach\r\nMac Robartaich, founded the monastery of St. Peter at Ratisbon about\r\n1070; and he was succeeded there by six abbots of north Irish birth. He\r\nwrote a commentary on the Pauline Epistles, which is still preserved in\r\nthe Imperial Library at Vienna. The other, Mael Brigte by name, left\r\nIreland in 1056, and after some wanderings established himself at Mainz\r\nin 1069. He compiled a chronicle, which is of considerable value.[11]\r\nHereafter I shall have to mention other Irish men of travel; and it will\r\nbe seen that from some of them, who returned home, came the main impulse\r\nto the reform of the Irish Church.\r\n\r\nThe battle of Clontarf broke the power of the Danes in Ireland; but it\r\ndid not secure their departure from the country. Those that remained\r\nwere mainly settled in the four cities of Dublin, Wexford, Waterford and\r\nLimerick. In due time these four Danish colonies adopted the Christian\r\nFaith, and before long they became organized churches, each presided\r\nover by a bishop. In Dublin this took place a quarter of a century after\r\nthe battle of Clontarf, the first bishop being Dunan, in whose\r\nepiscopate the Danish king, Sitric, founded the Cathedral of the Holy\r\nTrinity about 1040. Of the early ecclesiastical history of Wexford\r\npractically nothing is known; but the first bishop of Waterford was\r\nconsecrated in 1096,[12] and the first bishop of Limerick eight or ten\r\nyears later.[13] These were the first churches in Ireland ruled by\r\nbishops who were not abbots; and it seems that each of the bishops had a\r\ndefined diocese. The dioceses of Dublin, Waterford, and perhaps Wexford,\r\nwere very small, extending only a little way, if at all, beyond the\r\nwalls of the Cathedral city. The diocese of Limerick, on the other hand,\r\nwas extensive; rather larger than the present diocese of the same name.\r\nBut whether large or small each of these dioceses presented to the eyes\r\nof the Irish a model of Church government similar to that in vogue on\r\nthe Continent, and utterly different from that to which they were\r\naccustomed.\r\n\r\nThis might prove a potent factor in the Reformation, once a tendency\r\ndeveloped among the Irish to bring their ecclesiastical machinery into\r\nconformity with that of the rest of the world. But it is manifest that\r\nby itself it would not induce them to re-model their hierarchy. It was\r\nnot to be expected that they would cast aside the tradition of\r\ncenturies, moved merely by a desire to imitate their late enemies. If,\r\nas is commonly held, the Danish dioceses, without exception, held\r\nthemselves aloof from, or were hostile to, Irish Christianity, such a\r\nresult could hardly have been attained, at any rate until the coming of\r\nthe Anglo-Normans. These later invaders would doubtless have forced\r\ndiocesan episcopacy on the Irish Church. But that it was established in\r\nIreland before the country came, even in part, under English rule, is\r\ncertain. So we must ask the question: What was the connecting link which\r\nbound the Church of the Danish colonists to that of Celtic Ireland? By\r\nway of answer I point to the remarkable fact, often overlooked, that all\r\nthe earliest bishops of the Danish dioceses were of Irish birth. Why\r\nDanish Christians should have elected Irishmen as their bishops I do not\r\nattempt to explain. But the evidence for the fact is clear.\r\n\r\nThe first two bishops of Dublin, Dunan and Patrick (Gilla Pátraic), had\r\nunmistakably Irish names. So too had their immediate successors Donough\r\nO'Hanley and his nephew Samuel O'Hanley; and of these two the latter is\r\nstated by the English chronicler Eadmer[14] to have been \"natione\r\nHibernensis.\" The next bishop, Gregory--the first archbishop of\r\nDublin--was likewise \"natione Hibernensis\" according to the continuator\r\nof Florence of Worcester.[15] He was followed by St. Laurence O'Toole,\r\nof whose nationality it is unnecessary to give proof.\r\n\r\nMalchus, the earliest bishop of Waterford, was an Irishman;[16] so also\r\nwas Gilbert, the first bishop of Limerick. And when Gilbert resigned his\r\nsee, after an episcopate of thirty-five years, he was succeeded by\r\nPatrick, whose name tells its own tale.[17]\r\n\r\nMost of the Irish rulers of Danish dioceses whom I have mentioned were\r\nmen of travel. Patrick of Dublin, to whose learning Lanfranc bears\r\ntestimony, \"was nourished in monastic institutions from his\r\nboyhood,\"[18] and certainly not, in an Irish religious house. Donough\r\nO'Hanley, before his consecration, was a monk of Canterbury; Samuel\r\nO'Hanley was a monk of St. Albans;[19] Malchus was called to Waterford\r\nfrom Walkelin's monastery at Winchester;[20] Gilbert of Limerick had\r\nvisited Normandy,[21] and at a later date we find him assisting at the\r\nconsecration of a bishop in Westminster Abbey.[22] Such men had had\r\ntraining which familiarized them with Roman methods of Church\r\nGovernment. They were well fitted to organize and rule their dioceses.\r\nAnd if they desired to imbue the Celtic Church with the principles which\r\nthey had learnt, and on which they acted, their nationality gave them a\r\nground of appeal which no Dane could have had. It is of course not to be\r\nassumed that all of them were so disposed. The Danish Christians of\r\nDublin not only stood aside from the Celtic Church; for reasons which\r\nwill appear later they were inimical to it, and it to them. Their\r\nbishops, with the possible exception of the first, made profession of\r\ncanonical obedience to the English Primates. Not only so: they gloried\r\nin their subjection to Canterbury. \"We have always been willing subjects\r\nof your predecessors,\" wrote the burgesses and clergy of Dublin to\r\nRalph, archbishop of Canterbury, when the see was vacant in 1121. And\r\nthen, after a reference to the great jealousy of Cellach of Armagh\r\nagainst them, they proceed to declare, \"We will not obey his command,\r\nbut desire to be always under your rule. Therefore we beseech you to\r\npromote Gregory to the episcopate if you wish to retain any longer the\r\nparish which we have kept for you so long.\"[23] It was clearly\r\nimpossible that this diocese could directly influence the Irish in the\r\ndirection of reform. But no such obstacle barred the path of the first\r\nbishops of Limerick and Waterford. Gilbert owed no allegiance to\r\nCanterbury; Malchus was consecrated at Canterbury, but he soon escaped\r\nhis profession of obedience to Anselm.[24] Both became leaders of the\r\nromanizing movement in Ireland.\r\n\r\nBut the influence of the Danish dioceses on the Irish Church was not\r\nlimited to the personal action of their bishops. Indirectly all of them,\r\nincluding Dublin, had a share in promoting the Reformation. Archbishop\r\nLanfranc, as early as 1072, claimed that his primacy included Ireland as\r\nwell as England.[25] The claim, curiously enough, was based on Bede's\r\n_History_, in which there is not a single word which supports it. But\r\nthe arrival two years later of Patrick, elect of Dublin, seeking\r\nconsecration at his hands, gave him his opportunity to enforce it. When\r\nPatrick returned to take possession of his see he carried with him two\r\nletters from Lanfranc. One was addressed to Gothric, the Manx prince who\r\nfor the moment was king of Dublin. Lanfranc, with tactful exaggeration,\r\ndubs him \"glorious king of Ireland,\" and tells him that in consecrating\r\nPatrick he had followed the custom of his predecessors in the chair of\r\nSt. Augustine. The other letter was more important. It was directed to\r\nTurlough O'Brien, grandson of Brian Boroimhe, who is also styled,\r\ninconsistently, and not altogether truly, \"magnificent king of Ireland\":\r\nhe was doubtless king of Ireland in hope, but in fact he never extended\r\nhis sway beyond the southern half of the island. Turlough's attention is\r\ncalled to the irregularities of the Irish Church. He is urged to call a\r\ncouncil of bishops and religious men for the extirpation of those evil\r\ncustoms, and to be present at it in person. This letter evidently\r\nproduced an impression, and not only on Turlough O'Brien. For a few\r\nyears later Lanfranc wrote another letter, this time to a bishop named\r\nDonnell and others, who had sought his advice on a difficult question\r\nconcerning the sacrament of baptism.[26]\r\n\r\nAnselm followed in the footsteps of Lanfranc. Not long after his\r\nconsecration (1093) he wrote to Donnell, Donough O'Hanley and the rest\r\nof the bishops of Ireland, begging the aid of their prayers, and urging\r\nthem to consult him in all cases of difficulty. Almost immediately\r\nafterwards came the election of Malchus, bishop of Waterford, in 1096.\r\nAmong those who signed the petition for his consecration were Bishop\r\nDonnell, Samuel O'Hanley, whom Anselm had consecrated for Dublin earlier\r\nin the same year, and O'Dunan, bishop of Meath (_Idunan episcopus\r\nMidiae_), whose name we shall do well to remember. But most notable of\r\nall were Murtough O'Brien, son of Turlough, then the strongest of Irish\r\nkings, soon to be _ardrí_, and his brother Dermot O'Brien.[27] It is\r\nclear that Lanfranc had won the O'Briens to the Romanizing side; and\r\nAnselm was determined to hold them fast. Within the next few years there\r\nwas a fairly regular correspondence between him and Murtough, of which\r\nsome letters have been preserved.[28] The relation between the two men\r\nwas evidently most friendly. And the archbishop fully exploited his\r\nopportunity. Again and again he reminded the king of his duty to repress\r\nabuses, the most important of which in his eyes were lax sexual\r\nmorality, and the consecration of bishops by single bishops, without\r\nfixed sees or defined dioceses.\r\n\r\nSo Lanfranc and Anselm schooled the O'Briens in the principles of Rome.\r\nAnd from one point of view their efforts were completely successful. The\r\nO'Briens became staunch friends of the Reform movement in Ireland. But\r\nfrom another point of view they failed. We must remember that their aim\r\nwas not only to purify the Irish Church, but to bring it into subjection\r\nto Canterbury. That they did not succeed in doing. The Reformation,\r\nwhich they taught the O'Briens to support, meant, in the end, a\r\nrepudiation of the pretensions of the English primates.\r\n\r\nI have mentioned among those who were concerned in the election of\r\nMalchus of Waterford, O'Dunan, bishop of Meath. He is unquestionably\r\nMáel Muire Ua Dunáin, whom the annalists describe as \"learned bishop of\r\nthe Goidhil, and head of the clergy of Ireland, and steward of the\r\nalmsdeeds of the world,\" and who died on Christmas Eve, 1117, at the age\r\nof seventy-six. He is mentioned in a charter in the Book of Kells, the\r\ndate of which is apparently about 1100, as Senior of Leath Chuinn\r\n(_i.e._ the north of Ireland).[29] He was fifty-five when Malchus was\r\nelected, and had probably already attained the eminence throughout\r\nIreland which is attested by the high-flown phrases of the Annals. That\r\nhe was then bishop of Meath in the modern sense is impossible; the title\r\nat that period would mean no more than that he was a bishop who lived\r\nwithin the borders of the Kingdom of Meath. But the _Annals of\r\nTigernach_ tell us that he died at Clonard, from which it may perhaps be\r\ninferred that his see was at that place. His importance for us just now\r\nis that he is the only adherent of the Reform movement whom we have yet\r\ndiscovered in the north of Ireland.\r\n\r\n\r\nII.--The First Stage\r\n\r\nBefore proceeding further in our investigation of the origin and course\r\nof the Reformation, it may be well to recall how far we have already\r\nadvanced. We started from the fact that a Reformation of the Irish\r\nChurch was actually accomplished in the twelfth century, and we\r\nproceeded to look for the causes which may have brought it about. We\r\nhave found that the first of these was the revival of learning\r\nconsequent on the cessation of the ravages of the Norsemen. We have\r\nnoted also the restoration at the same period of communication between\r\nIreland and the rest of Europe--the coming of students to the Irish\r\nschools, and the wanderings of Irish scholars in other lands. We have\r\nseen that the establishment of the Danish dioceses gave to the Irish a\r\nmodel of diocesan episcopacy, and that among the Irish-born bishops of\r\nthose dioceses there were men capable of leading a Reform movement. And\r\nwe have learned that Lanfranc and Anselm, through their relation with\r\nthe Danish dioceses, found means to induce the more conspicuous civil\r\nand religious leaders of the Celtic population to undertake the work of\r\nreconstituting the Church. Finally, we have been able to name some\r\npersons who might be expected to take a prominent place in the early\r\nstages of the Reformation. They are Gilbert of Limerick, Malchus of\r\nWaterford, O'Dunan of Meath, and the princes of the O'Brien family. The\r\nbest proof that we have rightly conceived the origin of the movement\r\nwill come before us when we study the share which these persons\r\nseverally had in promoting it.\r\n\r\nWe must now trace, as far as it can be done, the first steps in the\r\nprocess by which, under the influences which I have indicated, the\r\nChurch of Ireland passed from its older to its later hierarchical\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\nThe earliest attempt to give concrete form to the principles of the\r\nReformers seems to have been made in the Kingdom of Meath, about the\r\nyear 1100. But the primary evidence for the fact is of much later date.\r\nThere are extant some constitutions of Simon Rochfort, bishop of Meath,\r\nput forth at a synod of his diocese held at the monastery of SS. Peter\r\nand Paul at Newtown, near Trim, in 1216. The first of them recites an\r\nordinance of the papal legate, Cardinal John Paparo, at the Council of\r\nKells in 1152, which is of great importance.\r\n\r\nPaparo ordered that as the bishops of the weaker sees died off,\r\narch-priests, or, as we call them, rural deans, should succeed to their\r\nplace, and take charge of the clergy and people within their\r\nborders.[30]\r\n\r\nThe inference which this enactment suggests is that the weaker sees to\r\nwhich it refers were the centres of small dioceses, which Paparo desired\r\nto be converted into rural deaneries. In accordance with the ordinance\r\nof Paparo, Rochfort's synod enjoined that rural deans should be placed\r\nin the five sees of Trim, Kells, Slane, Skreen and Dunshaughlin, each of\r\nwhom should supervise the churches in his own deanery. These, with\r\nClonard, which had long been the see of Rochfort's diocese, are six of\r\nthe twelve rural deaneries into which the present diocese of Meath is\r\ndivided.[31] I conclude that they, and probably the remaining six,\r\ncoincided more or less closely with dioceses ruled by bishops in the\r\nfirst half of the twelfth century.[32]\r\n\r\nLet us now call to our aid a much earlier witness. The annalists inform\r\nus that in the year 1111 there was an assembly at Usnagh in Meath. It\r\ndecreed that \"the parishes[33] of Meath\" should be equally divided\r\nbetween the bishops of Clonmacnoise and Clonard. We may infer that\r\nClonmacnoise and Clonard, two of the present rural deaneries, were then\r\ndioceses. It is not likely that the dioceses of Meath would have been\r\nformed into two groups, each to constitute the diocese of a bishop who\r\nhad already no diocese of his own. But however that may be, we have here\r\nproof that before 1111 Meath had been parted into a number of small\r\ndioceses ruled by bishops.\r\n\r\nIf the question be asked, By whose authority or influence this division\r\nof Meath into dioceses was made? I can suggest no one more likely than\r\nMáel Muire Ua Dunáin, the \"bishop of Meath\" to whom reference has\r\nalready been made.[34] He was a Meath man, and probably bishop of\r\nClonard: he was an ecclesiastic of great repute, especially in the\r\nnorth; and he was a devoted adherent of the Reform movement. His action,\r\nif indeed it was his, was premature and ill-advised. As we shall see,\r\nhis work had to be slowly undone. But it is remarkable, as the first\r\nattempt known to us to establish diocesan episcopacy among the Irish. I\r\nshall have more to say about it hereafter; but now I must follow the\r\nmain stream of events.\r\n\r\nGilbert,[35] the first bishop of Limerick, as has already been noted,\r\nwas an Irishman. Indeed, we may venture to describe him as one of the\r\nmost remarkable Irishmen of his time, in spite of the fact that the\r\nAnnals pass him by in almost complete silence. He was at any rate a\r\nstaunch supporter, or, as we should rather say, the leader of the\r\nReformation movement in its earliest course. In a letter written in 1107\r\nAnselm exhorted him, in virtue of their mutual friendship, to make good\r\nuse of his episcopal office by correcting that which was amiss, and\r\nplanting and sowing good customs, calling to aid him in the work his\r\nking (Murtough O'Brien), the other Irish bishops, and all whom he could\r\npersuade.[36] That, assuredly, Gilbert was forward to do.\r\n\r\nNo sooner had he taken possession of his see than he began to organize a\r\ndiocese. Its boundaries seem to have been fixed with care. It was\r\nexactly co-extensive with the modern diocese of Limerick, except on the\r\nnorth, where it stretched across the Shannon and included part of the\r\npresent diocese of Killaloe.[37] Moreover he made the Church of St. Mary\r\nhis Cathedral Church; indeed it is not unlikely that he built it to\r\nserve that purpose.\r\n\r\nA few years later he was appointed Legate of the Holy See. It is\r\nmanifest that his new office gave him a unique opportunity of moulding\r\nthe fortunes of the Irish Church. In Ireland Gilbert was now virtually\r\nthe chief prelate and head of the Church. He was the representative and\r\nembodiment of the authority of the Holy See. The whole Romanizing party\r\nwould naturally circle round him as their leader, and many waverers\r\nwould be attracted to the new movement in the Irish Church, by the claim\r\nwhich he could make to speak in the name of the head of the Church\r\nCatholic.\r\n\r\nIt was after he became legate, and no doubt in virtue of his legatine\r\ncommission, that he issued a treatise which may be regarded as the\r\nprogramme of the Reformation. It is entitled _De Statu Ecclesiae_. Of\r\nthis a fragment, including its earlier chapters, is still in our\r\nhands.[38]\r\n\r\nBefore giving a slight summary of its contents I must mention that it is\r\naddressed \"to the bishops and presbyters of the whole of Ireland,\" and\r\nthat Gilbert declares that he wrote it at the urgent request of many of\r\nthem. In this statement there may lurk an element of exaggeration. But\r\nbehind it there lies at least so much truth as this. A considerable body\r\nof the clergy had approached the newly made legate, and requested his\r\ninstruction regarding the proper constitution of the Church--for such is\r\nthe subject of his tract; and that implies that the Romanizing movement\r\nwas no longer in its infancy. There were many bishops and presbyters who\r\nhad become dissatisfied with the old Irish method of Church government.\r\nThey desired to bring it into conformity with that of the Roman Church.\r\nBut they were in some uncertainty as to the nature of the changes that\r\nshould be made, and so they asked Gilbert to give them authoritative\r\ncounsel.\r\n\r\nIn reply to their petition, with the aid of an elaborate diagram, he\r\nsketched as follows the organization of a properly ordered Church.\r\n\r\nThe bishops, he tells us, and others of higher rank in the ministry\r\nbelong to the general Church, as distinct from particular churches. The\r\npriest is the highest officer in a particular church. It is the primary\r\nduty of every priest to serve and obey his bishop with all humility. For\r\nby the bishops particular churches are ruled. To each bishop are subject\r\nall the churches within his jurisdiction. And this applies as well to\r\nmonastic establishments as to parishes. The head of each parish is a\r\npriest, the head of each monastery is an abbot, who is himself a priest.\r\nThe bishop has a pontifical church, in which is his see (_sedes_), and\r\nof which he is the head. From it he governs the inferior churches. A\r\nbishop can perform all the offices of a priest, but he has seven\r\nfunctions peculiar to himself: to confirm, to bless, to absolve, to hold\r\nsynods, to dedicate churches and altars, to consecrate the ornaments of\r\nchurches, to ordain abbots and abbesses and the secular clergy.\r\nGilbert's diagram represented the bishop as ruling two churches; but he\r\nexplains that this is to be interpreted figuratively. A bishop may have\r\nas many as a thousand churches within his jurisdiction: he must have at\r\nleast ten.\r\n\r\nA bishop is himself subject to authority. His immediate superior is the\r\narchbishop. An archbishop has a sphere of immediate jurisdiction, like\r\nany other bishop, but he also rules a number of subject bishops. Of\r\nthese there must be at least three; but an archbishop is not permitted\r\nto have more than twenty subject bishops--an important point, as we\r\nshall see. Above the archbishop is the primate. It is the special\r\nprivilege of the primate to ordain and crown the king. He too has his\r\nsphere of immediate jurisdiction, and he must have at least one subject\r\narchbishop, but not more than six.\r\n\r\nPrimates and archbishops must be consecrated at Rome by the Pope, or at\r\nleast must receive the pall[39] from him. Without the pall they are not\r\nraised above their fellow-bishops.\r\n\r\nFinally, the primates are subject to the Pope, and the Pope to Christ.\r\n\r\nThe higher members of the hierarchy have their analogues in the civil\r\norder. The Pope corresponds to the emperor, the primate to the king, an\r\narchbishop to a duke, a bishop to an earl, a priest to a knight. But all\r\nthese are merely grades of the order of priests. There are but seven\r\norders of the ministry--priests, deacons, sub-deacons, acolytes,\r\nexorcists, readers and door-keepers. Of the laity Gilbert says little.\r\nThey are of two classes; husbandmen and soldiers. Their duties are to\r\nattend church, to pay first-fruits, tithes and oblations, to avoid evil\r\nand do good, and to obey their pastors.\r\n\r\nThere is nothing original in all this; and some parts of it must have\r\nbeen very puzzling to stay-at-home Irishmen. For example, what were they\r\nto make of Gilbert's comparison of primates, archbishops, bishops and\r\npriests to kings, dukes, earls and knights? They knew as little of dukes\r\nand earls in the civil order as they did of primates and archbishops in\r\nthe ecclesiastical; and they had far more kings than suited Gilbert's\r\nscheme. But the tract is important, both as a summary of the teaching\r\nwhich Gilbert had no doubt been inculcating far and wide for years, and\r\nas a permanent record, for future use, of the aims of the Reformers.\r\n\r\nHowever unintelligible the treatise may have been in parts, it brought\r\nout with startling clearness one or two essential points. First the\r\nChurch must be ruled by bishops. Even the monasteries are subject to\r\nthem. How amazing such a statement must have sounded to men who had\r\ninherited the tradition, many centuries old, that the abbots of\r\nmonasteries were the true ecclesiastical rulers, bishops their\r\nsubordinate officials.\r\n\r\nMoreover, bishoprics and dioceses could not be set up at random. The\r\nnumber of bishops and by consequence the size of dioceses must be\r\ncarefully considered. The puny bishoprics of Meath, for example, could\r\nform no part of a scheme such as Gilbert adumbrated.\r\n\r\nIt was manifest that if his guidance were to be followed, no mere\r\nmodification of existing arrangements would suffice. The old hierarchy\r\nmust be torn up by the roots, and a new hierarchy planted in its place.\r\n\r\nWe shall meet Gilbert again in the course of our story. But we may now\r\nturn aside from him to make the acquaintance of a new actor in the\r\ndrama of the Reformation. Like O'Dunan he was a Northern.\r\n\r\nCellach was born in 1080. He was an Armagh man, sprung from the family\r\nwhich for centuries past had provided abbots for the monastery of that\r\ncity, the grandson of a former abbot. He first appears on the scene in\r\n1105, when on the death of Abbot Donnell he became coarb of Patrick and\r\nabbot of Armagh. He was elected, we may assume, in the customary way. He\r\nwas then under twenty-six years of age, and was apparently still a\r\nlayman. But his subsequent action shows that he was already a convinced\r\ndisciple of the new movement. Doubtless he had fallen under the spell of\r\nGilbert of Limerick. Six weeks after his election he abandoned the\r\ntradition of a century and a half, and received holy orders. But in\r\nother respects he trod in the footsteps of his predecessors. In the\r\nfollowing year he went on a circuit of the Cenél Eoghain, and \"took away\r\nhis full demand: namely, a cow for every six, or an in-calf heifer for\r\nevery three, or a half ounce of silver for every four, besides many\r\ndonations also.\" Next he proceeded to Munster, with similar results. But\r\nhis circuit of Munster is important for other reasons. There he had\r\nopportunities of intercourse with his Munster friends, Gilbert of\r\nLimerick and Malchus of Waterford. And with that circuit we may connect\r\ntwo incidents of the highest significance. In 1106, apparently in the\r\nlatter part of the year, Caincomrac Ua Baigill, bishop of Armagh, died.\r\nThe news of his death probably reached Cellach while he was in the\r\nsouth. Certainly in Munster Cellach was consecrated bishop. It is\r\nimpossible not to connect the latter event with the former. He was\r\nconsecrated to fill the vacancy created by the death of O'Boyle. Thus he\r\nwas now bishop of Armagh as well as coarb of Patrick. In his own person\r\nhe united the two lines of coarbial and episcopal succession, which had\r\nparted asunder in 957, when the first of a series of lay coarbs had been\r\nelected, and the first of the six contemporary bishops had been\r\nconsecrated.[40] This was a great gain for the Reformers. The old\r\nanomaly of a ruler of the Church who was not a bishop had, so far as\r\nArmagh was concerned, disappeared for the time. And Armagh was the\r\nprincipal ecclesiastical centre in Ireland. Cellach might now call\r\nhimself archbishop of Armagh, though he had not fulfilled the condition\r\nlaid down by Gilbert, that an archbishop must receive the pall at the\r\nhands of the Pope. The title was actually accorded to him by so rigid a\r\npapalist as St. Bernard.[41]\r\n\r\nBut there was more to come. In the year 1101 there had been held at\r\nCashel a great assembly of the clergy and people of Ireland. Bishop\r\nO'Dunan, whom we already know, was at their head. To it came also\r\nMurtough O'Brien, who earlier in the year, after an expedition in force\r\nthrough Connaught and Ulster, had entered Tara as _ardrí_ of\r\nIreland.[42] In the presence of the assembly he surrendered Cashel, the\r\nroyal city of the kings of Munster, to the Church, as an offering to God\r\nand St. Patrick.[43] When we consider the persons who were concerned in\r\nthis transaction we find good ground for the suspicion that the gift was\r\nintended in some way to benefit the movement for reform. Now St. Bernard\r\ninforms us that Cellach created a second archiepiscopal see in Ireland\r\nin subordination to Armagh.[44] After his manner he does not tell us\r\nwhere it was situated. It is certain, however, that it was at Cashel,\r\nwhich was the seat of an archbishop in 1110.[45] It was probably\r\nsurrendered for this very purpose by O'Brien. And if it be asked when\r\nCellach erected it into an archbishopric the answer is scarcely\r\ndoubtful. Only once, so far as we know, did Cellach enter Munster before\r\n1110. It was on the occasion of his circuit. In the year of the circuit,\r\ntherefore, 1106, the archbishopric of Cashel was founded. In that same\r\nyear, or shortly afterwards, Malchus of Waterford was translated to the\r\nnew see, and became its first archbishop. There is no evidence that a\r\nnew bishop was consecrated for Waterford in succession to Malchus: this\r\nindeed is unlikely. But it should be noted that by his acceptance of an\r\narchbishopric subject to Armagh, Malchus was released from the\r\nprofession of obedience which he had made to Anselm ten years earlier.\r\nHe was now a bishop of the Church of Ireland, with undivided allegiance.\r\n\r\nThe reason for the creation of a second archbishopric is not difficult\r\nto guess. By this time the plans of the Reformers must have been in some\r\ndegree matured: before long, as we shall see, they were set forth in\r\nminute detail. Already Cellach was archbishop of Armagh. His suffragan\r\nsees, indeed, apart from those formed by O'Dunan, if their bishops\r\nacknowledged themselves as his suffragans, were _in nubibus_. But\r\nsuffragan sees he must have, according to the theory of Gilbert, each\r\nwith a diocese attached to it. They must be at least three in number,\r\nbut _not more than twenty_. Now it was a foregone conclusion that if the\r\nReformers had their way there would be more than twenty dioceses in\r\nIreland. Hence, by Gilbert's rule, there must be a second archbishop.\r\nMoreover, by making the archbishopric of Cashel subject to Armagh,\r\nCellach secured for himself and his successors a title yet more imposing\r\nthan that of archbishop. He was now Primate of Ireland; for it sufficed,\r\nif Gilbert spoke truly, that a primate should have one subject\r\narchbishop. As coarb of Patrick Cellach's authority ranged over the\r\nwhole country; as primate his sway would be no less extensive. He\r\nactually claimed the title, if not then, at least a few years later.[46]\r\n\r\nWe may now for a while leave Gilbert and Cellach and Malchus and\r\nO'Dunan. With Gilbert as legate, and Cellach and Malchus as archbishops;\r\nwith dioceses already formed at Limerick and Waterford and in Meath,\r\nprobably also at Armagh and Cashel and Wexford; with the great extension\r\nof the movement, and its spread from Munster to Meath and Ulster, all\r\nwas ready for the meeting of the Synod whose ordinances should give\r\ndefinite shape to the policy to be pursued in the future.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII.--The Synod of Rathbreasail\r\n\r\nGeoffrey Keating quotes from the lost _Annals of Clonenagh_ an account\r\nof a national Synod or Council held at Rathbreasail in the year\r\n1110.[47] The existing Annals record that a national Council met at\r\nFiadh meic Oengusa in 1111. With the exception of the _Annals of\r\nInisfallen_, none of them mention Rathbreasail; but the Inisfallen\r\nannalist tells us that it is another name for Fiadh meic Oengusa.[48] I\r\nshall assume therefore that there were not two national Synods in\r\nsuccessive years, but one; and, following the _Annals of Clonenagh_, I\r\nshall call it the Synod of Rathbreasail, and date it in 1110.\r\n\r\nThe Synod of Rathbreasail marks the beginning of the second stage of the\r\nReformation movement. It was convened by the papal legate; its purpose\r\nwas the Romanizing of the Irish Church, and, in particular, the\r\nestablishment in it of diocesan episcopacy. Fortunately Keating's\r\nexcerpts from its Acts give us ample information concerning the canons\r\nwhich dealt with this matter.\r\n\r\nThe annalists, as I have said, describe the council as a national\r\nassembly. But we can hardly claim so much for it. It is much more\r\nprobable that it was in reality a meeting of the Reforming party. The\r\nfirst signature appended to its canons was that of Gilbert, who presided\r\nas legate of the Holy See. He was followed by Cellach, \"coarb of Patrick\r\nand Primate of Ireland,\" and Malchus, \"archbishop of Cashel,\" whom we\r\nhave known as bishop of Waterford. The signatures of many bishops\r\nfollowed, but they have not been preserved. We know, however, that\r\nBishop O'Dunan was present, as was also Murtough O'Brien, king of\r\nIreland. These were all leaders of the Reforming party; and it is\r\nevident that they guided the deliberations of the Council. Moreover\r\nthere were no representatives of the provinces of Connaught and\r\nLeinster, in which as yet, it appears, the Reform movement had not\r\nestablished itself. That is made clear by notes appended to canons which\r\nspecially concerned those provinces. One of them begins thus: \"If the\r\nConnaught clergy agree to this ... we desire it, and if they do not\"--in\r\nthat case they may do as they please, with certain limitations. The\r\nclergy of Leinster are accorded a similar liberty. It is obvious that if\r\namong the members of the Council there had been men who could speak with\r\nauthority for the provinces mentioned such notes need not, and\r\ntherefore could not, have been written. The Council represented Munster,\r\nUlster and Meath. It was national, not because it could speak for all\r\nIreland, but because it made laws for all Ireland.\r\n\r\nI must now give an account of those laws, so far as they relate to the\r\norganization of the Church. I follow the _Annals of Clonenagh_, as\r\nreported by Keating: but in two or three places I have been obliged to\r\namend his text.[49]\r\n\r\nThe fathers began by appealing to English precedent. \"Just as twelve\r\nbishops were fixed under Canterbury in the south of England, and twelve\r\nbishops in the north under the city of York,\" so it was ordained that\r\nthere should be twelve bishops in the south of Ireland, and twelve in\r\nthe north. The constitution of the Irish Church was henceforth, it would\r\nseem, to be a copy of that of the English Church. But, as it happens,\r\nneither in 1110 nor in any other year of its history, had the Church of\r\nEngland twelve sees under Canterbury and twelve under York. How then can\r\nwe explain the statement of the Synod? The answer is simple. Bede[50]\r\npreserves a letter of Pope Gregory the Great, written in 601, in which\r\nSt. Augustine of Canterbury was directed to consecrate twelve bishops as\r\nhis own suffragans. He was also ordered to consecrate a bishop for York,\r\nwho, if his mission proved successful, was likewise to consecrate twelve\r\nsuffragans, and to be promoted to the dignity of a metropolitan. It is\r\nclear that the Synod found its precedent in this letter, not observing\r\nthat Pope Gregory's ordinance was never carried into effect. But they\r\nmade another mistake. For Gregory intended that there should be twelve\r\nbishops in the north of England, and twelve in the south, exclusive of\r\nthe archbishops, twenty-six in all; while it is evident that the Council\r\nof Rathbreasail intended that there should be twelve bishops in the\r\nnorth of Ireland, and twelve in the south, including the archbishops,\r\ntwenty-four in all. Some one whose lead the Synod followed--probably the\r\npapal legate--had read his Bede with little care. But that is not\r\nsurprising. Lanfranc had misread Bede, when on his authority he claimed\r\nto be Primate of Ireland; why should not Gilbert have gone astray in\r\nlike fashion? The point to be noticed and emphasized is that the first\r\nact of the Synod was to fix the number of the Irish sees, on the curious\r\nprinciple that what the wisdom of Pope Gregory held to be good for\r\nEngland would suit Ireland also.\r\n\r\nApparently the next step in the procedure was to determine the\r\ndistribution of the dioceses among the provinces, and to fix the see of\r\neach prospective diocese. Ireland was divided into two portions by a\r\nline running, approximately, from Dublin to Galway. The part to the\r\nnorth of that line was known as Leath Chuinn, the part to the south as\r\nLeath Mogha. In Leath Chuinn were the provinces of Ulster and Connaught\r\nand the kingdom of Meath; in Leath Mogha were the provinces of Munster\r\nand Leinster. The Synod decreed that there should be five sees in\r\nUlster, five in Connaught, and two in Meath, making twelve bishoprics\r\nfor Leath Chuinn; there were to be seven in Munster and five in\r\nLeinster--twelve bishoprics for Leath Mogha. The names of all these sees\r\nwere given in the Acts of the Synod.\r\n\r\nFinally the Synod defined the boundaries of the dioceses to which the\r\nsees severally belonged. It is not my purpose to give a minute\r\ndescription of these boundaries. That would involve an excursus on Irish\r\ntopography, which would be, to say the least, out of place. It will\r\nsuffice to indicate roughly those of the five dioceses of Ulster. To the\r\nwest was what was called the \"parish\" (_fairche_)[51] of Derry or\r\nRaphoe. It was nearly identical with our diocese of Raphoe. The only\r\nimportant difference is that it included Inishowen, the district between\r\nLough Swilly and Lough Foyle, which now belongs to the diocese of Derry.\r\nNext to the parish of Derry or Raphoe the Synod placed the parish of\r\nArdstraw.[52] Ardstraw never became the see, and the diocese was\r\nsubsequently known as \"of Derry.\" It extended eastward to the\r\nCarntougher Mountains, and coincides pretty closely with the present\r\ndiocese. It subsequently gained Inishowen from its western neighbour,\r\nand the strip between the Carntougher Mountains and the Bann from its\r\neastern neighbour. But otherwise it remains much as the Synod of\r\nRathbreasail determined. Next to it was to be the parish of Connor or\r\nDown. When the portion of it to the west of the Bann was transferred to\r\nDerry, it coincided almost exactly with the modern Down, Connor and\r\nDromore. On the other hand the parish of Armagh seems originally to have\r\nincluded the modern county of Monaghan: it has shrunk to little more\r\nthan half its size. The parish of Clogher, at first very small, has\r\nextended east and west, and is three times as large as it was intended\r\nto be. On the whole the work of the Synod has stood well the test of\r\nmany centuries of history.\r\n\r\nIt is indeed wonderful that it should have done so. For the method of\r\nthe Synod--fixing the number of the dioceses before their boundaries\r\nwere discussed--was unstatesmanlike. Always, and necessarily,\r\necclesiastical divisions have coincided with civil divisions. We may\r\nfind the germ of the rule in the Acts of the Apostles.[53] If this was\r\ninevitable in other lands it was even more inevitable in Ireland in\r\npre-Norman days. The Irish people was a collection of clans, having, it\r\nis true, certain common institutions, but bound together by no sort of\r\nnational constitution, and often at war with each other. If\r\necclesiastical divisions were to be permanent in Ireland, they must take\r\naccount of the tribal divisions of the country. The primary\r\necclesiastical unit must be the territory of a tribe, just as it was the\r\nprimary civil unit.[54] But to base the limits of dioceses, consistently\r\nand in every case, on tribal boundaries was impossible when the number\r\nof dioceses was arbitrarily fixed beforehand. It could not be that\r\nexactly the same number of dioceses would suit Ulster as suited Leinster\r\nand Connaught. In one province the tribes would be more or less\r\nnumerous, and more or less mutually antagonistic, than in another. By\r\nreason of its method, therefore, the Synod was doomed to fall short of\r\ncomplete success in its work.\r\n\r\nWe have instances in Ulster of the soundness of the principle that I\r\nhave stated. Take the diocese of Raphoe. It was designed to include\r\nInishowen. But from a tribal point of view Inishowen (Inis Eoghain)\r\nbelonged to the next diocese, which included the tribeland of Tír\r\nEoghain. Its inhabitants were of the same stock as the Cenél Eoghain,\r\nand were known as the Cenél Eoghain of the Island. So the natural result\r\nfollowed. Inishowen broke off from the diocese of Raphoe and became part\r\nof the diocese of Derry. When this happened the diocese of Raphoe was\r\nstabilized. It consisted of the land of a single tribe, the Cenél\r\nConaill; and so henceforth its limits were never altered.\r\n\r\nWe can easily understand, therefore, that the disregard of tribal\r\nboundaries, forced on it in many cases by its method, was an element of\r\nweakness in the Rathbreasail scheme. And yet it was natural that special\r\nstress should be laid on the arbitrary limitation of sees which was its\r\nmain cause. Ireland was overrun with bishops. It is said that over fifty\r\nof them attended the Synod of Rathbreasail; and they represented only\r\npart of the country. But Gilbert had laid down the rule that an\r\narchbishop could not have more than twenty suffragans. On this\r\nprinciple, if all the existing bishops had been provided with dioceses,\r\nor all the larger tribes had been given bishops, Ireland would have had\r\nnot two, but six or seven archbishops: and this would have been a\r\ntravesty of Catholic Church order, as it was then understood. It was\r\nessential that the number should be ruthlessly cut down.\r\n\r\nBut the legislators of Rathbreasail did not entirely ignore tribal\r\nboundaries. On the contrary, so far as the numerical basis of their\r\nscheme permitted, they took them into account. And here we find that the\r\nSynod was confronted with another difficulty. The territories of tribes\r\nwere fluctuating quantities. Hence, even if a diocese was the district\r\nof a single tribe, with very definite boundaries, no one could be sure\r\nthat in the course of years its limits would not change. Again I take an\r\nexample from Ulster. The Synod selected the Carntougher Mountains as the\r\nboundary between the dioceses of Derry and Connor. And wisely. For\r\nbetween those mountains and the Bann there dwelt a sept--the Fir\r\nLi--whose affinities were altogether with the people to the east of the\r\nriver. But only a few years after the Synod that territory was overrun\r\nby the O'Kanes of the Roe Valley, and the Fir Li retreated across the\r\nBann, never to return. The result followed which might have been\r\nexpected. Their territory was transferred from Connor to Derry, and the\r\nBann to this day is the boundary of the two dioceses.[55]\r\n\r\nIt may be well, before I pass to another subject, to call attention to\r\nsome special features of the Rathbreasail canons.\r\n\r\nFirst, let us note the prominence which is given to Limerick, the\r\ndiocese of Gilbert, the president of the Synod. Usually a diocese is\r\nsomewhat vaguely defined by four places on its borders. But here no less\r\nthan thirteen are named. So full are the indications that a fairly exact\r\nmap of the diocese could be drawn. Further, in this diocese alone\r\nmention is made of a Cathedral Church: \"The Church of Mary in Limerick\r\nis its principal church.\"[56] Note the present tense: \"The Church of\r\nMary _is_\"--not shall be--\"its principal church.\" We remember that\r\nGilbert insisted in the _De Statu Ecclesiae_ that a diocese should have\r\na \"pontifical church.\" Again, the boundaries of this one diocese are\r\nprotected by a clause which has no parallel elsewhere: \"Whosoever shall\r\ngo against these boundaries goes against the Lord, and against Peter the\r\nApostle, and St. Patrick and his coarb and the Christian Church.\" Who\r\nbut the legate of the Pope would have thus invoked St. Peter?\r\n\r\nSurely this portion of the ordinances of the Synod must have been\r\npenned by Gilbert himself. And the whole passage--by the minuteness of\r\nits description of the diocese, by the strength of the terms in which it\r\nis expressed, by the reference to the Cathedral Church as already\r\nexisting--suggests that the diocese was formed and organized before the\r\nSynod met, as I have already assumed. We may even suspect that an\r\nattempt had been made to invade it, which Gilbert stoutly resisted,\r\nrelying on his legatine authority.\r\n\r\nIn the list of dioceses there is an omission which demands explanation.\r\nNo mention whatever is made of Dublin, the oldest diocese in Ireland.\r\nNot only so; the northern limit of the diocese of Glendalough is marked\r\nby Lambay Island and Greenogue, which lies due west of it in the County\r\nMeath. Thus the diocese of Glendalough, as contemplated by the\r\nSynod--and, it may be added, as it was in fact forty years\r\nlater[57]--included the whole of the actually existing diocese of\r\nDublin. The Danish Christians of Dublin and their Irish bishop are\r\ntreated as interlopers; they are absolutely ignored. It may be said that\r\nthis was due to the mutual hostility which divided the diocese of Dublin\r\nfrom the native Church, and to the fact that the bishops of Dublin had\r\nalways been subject to Canterbury. But it is not enough to say this; for\r\nthe estrangement of Dublin from the Irish is the very thing that has to\r\nbe accounted for.\r\n\r\nIt had its root in the growing prosperity of the Danish city. The Irish\r\nhad no towns. Town life was introduced among them by the Norsemen. And\r\nof their towns Dublin was always the chief. By this time it had become\r\nso important that it had good right to be called the metropolis of the\r\ncountry. And its citizens were thoroughly aware of this. As early as\r\n1074 the burgesses of Dublin and their bishop, Patrick, claimed for it\r\nthat title.[58] Now in all reason a metropolis should have a\r\nmetropolitan as its bishop; and no doubt the bishops of Dublin thought\r\nthemselves _de facto_, if not _de jure_, superior to the other bishops\r\nof Ireland. In fact we find one of them playing the archbishop. We have\r\ntwo interesting letters of Anselm, written apparently about 1100. One of\r\nthem is addressed to Malchus, bishop of Waterford, directing him to\r\nrebuke Samuel O'Hanley, bishop of Dublin, for various irregularities, in\r\nparticular for having his cross carried before him like an archbishop;\r\nthe other is addressed to Samuel himself, and complains of the same\r\nactions.[59] These proceedings are not likely to have been brought to an\r\nend by Anselm's letters; and we may assume that they were continued as\r\nlong as Samuel held the see of Dublin. It was but natural that Cellach\r\nshould strongly resent them, for they were disrespectful both to himself\r\nand to the archbishop of Cashel. We are not surprised, therefore, to\r\nfind that on the death of Samuel in 1121, eleven years after\r\nRathbreasail, Cellach tried to get possession of the Church of\r\nDublin,[60] most probably with the intention of bringing it under the\r\njurisdiction of the bishop of Glendalough. Nor are we surprised that the\r\nmen of Dublin at once replied by electing another bishop and bidding\r\nRalph of Canterbury to consecrate him if he desired to retain the\r\nsuffragan see which they had so long preserved for him.[61] We shall see\r\nhereafter how the bishops of Dublin were at length induced to look with\r\nfavour on the Irish Church. Meanwhile we learn that they were not very\r\nobedient suffragans of Canterbury; and we cease to wonder that they were\r\nignored in the Rathbreasail decrees.\r\n\r\nAnother feature of the canons of the Synod is worth noting. In several\r\ninstances the see of a diocese was not absolutely fixed. Two places were\r\nnamed, and it was apparently left to the bishop of the future to select\r\nthat one of the two which he preferred to be his city. Thus we have a\r\ndiocese of Derry or Raphoe, a diocese of Connor or Down, another of\r\nWexford or Ferns, and so forth. The meaning of this is best seen by\r\ntaking a single example. To one of the dioceses of Munster was assigned\r\nthe area now occupied by the two dioceses of Waterford and Lismore. It\r\nconsisted of the original Danish diocese of Waterford, together with a\r\nmuch more extensive non-Danish area. Alternative sees were named; it was\r\ndescribed as the parish of Lismore or Waterford. Now Lismore was the\r\nmost sacred spot in the enlarged diocese. It was the site of a monastery\r\nfounded by St. Mochuta. It was an ideal place for a bishop's see. But it\r\nwas doubtless ruled at the moment by an abbot, the coarb of Mochuta.\r\nUnless he was prevailed on to accept episcopal orders, or was deprived\r\nof his authority, a diocesan bishop could not be established there. On\r\nthe other hand, Waterford had no sacred traditions; but it was already\r\nthe see of a diocese. In default of Lismore it would be a convenient\r\nplace for the see. Between Lismore and Waterford the circumstances of\r\nthe future must decide. Ultimately, it appears, Malchus retired from the\r\narchbishopric of Cashel, and became bishop of his older diocese, now so\r\nmuch greater than it had been. He placed his stool, however, not at\r\nWaterford but at Lismore.[62] A similar, but not always identical\r\ncourse was followed in other such cases.\r\n\r\nWhat the Synod of Rathbreasail actually accomplished was this. It gave\r\nto Ireland a paper constitution of the approved Roman and Catholic type.\r\nBut by doing this it had not achieved the purpose of its existence. In\r\nthe years that followed, its enactments had to be carried into effect.\r\nAnd here was the real crux. Before the Church came to be ruled by\r\ndiocesan bishops, the existing rulers--the coarbs of church\r\nfounders--must be dispossessed of their authority; the numerous bishops\r\nof the old Irish type must be got rid of; the jurisdiction of the new\r\nbishops must be fixed by common consent, or enforced without it; and\r\nrevenues must be provided for them. A mere synodal decree could not\r\naccomplish all this. The diocesan system could become a fact throughout\r\nthe whole Church, and the last vestiges of the ancient constitution be\r\nmade to disappear, only after determined effort, and probably bitter\r\ncontention. And when all was done it would certainly be found that the\r\nscheme of dioceses arranged at Rathbreasail had been largely departed\r\nfrom.\r\n\r\nI can best illustrate the nature of the difficulties which had to be\r\nencountered, and the length of time which might be required to overcome\r\nthem, by giving a short outline of the history of the forming of the\r\ndioceses of the kingdom of Meath.\r\n\r\nIn Meath, as we have seen, there were dioceses ruled by bishops before\r\nRathbreasail. But these dioceses were of small size. It may be doubted\r\nwhether most of them fulfilled the condition laid down by Gilbert, that\r\na bishop should have not less than ten churches within his jurisdiction.\r\nThey had therefore to be grouped under a smaller number of prelates.\r\nWhat had to be accomplished in this case was not so much the clipping of\r\nthe wings of the abbots, as the extirpation of the more recently\r\nappointed diocesan bishops. The Synod determined that the kingdom should\r\nbe divided into two dioceses, one in the west, the other in the east.\r\nThe western see was to be at Clonard, at the moment, as it seems, the\r\nsee of O'Dunan, and famed as the site of the great monastery of St.\r\nFinnian, founded in the sixth century; the eastern see was to be at\r\nDuleek, near Drogheda. Now a few months after the Synod of Rathbreasail\r\nthere was held at Usnagh a local synod of the men of Meath, at which the\r\nking and many notable persons were present.[63] This synod ordained that\r\nthe parishes of Meath should be equally divided between the bishops of\r\nClonmacnoise and Clonard. It will be observed that the principle of the\r\nRathbreasail decree was accepted, that there should be two, and only\r\ntwo, dioceses in Meath. But the change made in the sees is significant.\r\nThe Synod of Rathbreasail intended that Clonard should be the see of the\r\nwestern diocese, which would include Clonmacnoise. The Synod of Usnagh\r\ndemanded that Clonmacnoise, founded by one of the most noted of Irish\r\nsaints, St. Ciaran, should be one of the surviving sees, and that\r\nClonard should be the see, not of the western, but of the eastern half\r\nof the kingdom. Thus the Synod of Rathbreasail was at once met with\r\nstrenuous and, as it proved, successful opposition in Meath.\r\n\r\nAnd here I may mention another fact. A few years after the Synod we have\r\nproof of the existence of a diocese in the north of the kingdom, which\r\nhas not hitherto been mentioned, and which is not named in the\r\nRathbreasail canons. We know it as the diocese of Kilmore.[64] It may\r\nhave been one of O'Dunan's dioceses, or it may have been founded later.\r\nOne thing is certain. The diocese formed the territory of a strong\r\ntribe. Consequently it had in it the element of stability. It was never\r\nsuppressed: it exists to this day. So far as it was concerned the canons\r\nof Rathbreasail were a dead letter from the beginning.\r\n\r\nBut let us return to Clonard. It was the business of its successive\r\nbishops, in accordance with the decrees of Usnagh, to annex the small\r\nneighbouring bishoprics of east Meath. They had considerable success. We\r\npossess a list of churches granted by Eugenius, the last Irish bishop of\r\nClonard, to the monastery of St. Thomas the Martyr, Dublin.[65] They are\r\nscattered over the three deaneries of Dunshaughlin, Skreen and Trim.\r\nThus Eugenius had absorbed into his diocese the bishoprics of those\r\nthree places. Another document tells us that this same Eugenius\r\nconsecrated the church of Duleek;[66] which implies that the diocese of\r\nDuleek was also suppressed. Thus by 1191, the year of Eugenius's\r\ndeath--within eighty years of the Synod of Rathbreasail, and before the\r\nAnglo-Normans had captured the ecclesiastical domination of Meath--the\r\ndiocese of Clonard had expanded to four times its original size. Its\r\nbishop ruled the whole area of the modern county of Meath which lies\r\nsouth of the Boyne and Blackwater.\r\n\r\nSimon Rochfort, the first English bishop, stretched his arm further. We\r\nhave a charter of his, which may be dated before 1202, confirming to St.\r\nThomas's Abbey a number of churches in his diocese.[67] It includes\r\nmost, if not all, of the churches granted by his predecessor, but adds\r\nothers. Among these are some in the deanery of Slane. The bishopric of\r\nSlane had been absorbed.\r\n\r\nThe rapid extension of his diocese towards the north suggested to\r\nRochfort the desirability of having for his headquarters a more central\r\nplace than Clonard. So in 1202 he translated the see to Newtown, near\r\nTrim,[68] and began to call himself Bishop of Meath. Ten years later, as\r\nwe know, this \"impudent bishop\" captured the diocese of Kells.[69] The\r\nbishop of Meath (no longer of Clonard) from his see at Newtown had the\r\noversight of nearly the whole of the modern county. Within the confines\r\nof his diocese were the seven older dioceses of Clonard, Dunshaughlin,\r\nSkreen, Trim, Duleek, Slane and Kells. This was probably the whole of\r\nthe eastern diocese as designed by the Synod of Usnagh.\r\n\r\nBut the policy of annexation still went forward apace. Another document\r\nenables us to measure the progress of half a century. It is a concordat\r\nconcerning metropolitical visitations, between the archbishop of Armagh\r\nand Rochfort's third successor, Hugh de Tachmon. It is dated 9th April,\r\n1265.[70] The tenor of the concordat does not concern us: it is\r\nimportant for our purpose because it proves that in 1265 there were\r\neleven rural deaneries in the diocese of Meath. Four more petty dioceses\r\nhad been suppressed, Mullingar, Loxewdy, Ardnurcher and Fore. The\r\ndiocese was co-extensive with that of the present day, except that the\r\ndiocese of Clonmacnoise--as small in 1265 as it had been in 1100--was\r\nnot yet brought in.\r\n\r\nClonmacnoise preserved its independence three centuries longer. It was\r\nincorporated with Meath in 1569. Thus at length the dream of the fathers\r\nof Rathbreasail was fulfilled. There were two dioceses in the ancient\r\nkingdom of Meath--Meath and Kilmore. But neither Duleek nor Clonard nor\r\nClonmacnoise was a see. From that day to this, in fact, the diocese of\r\nMeath has had no see. And the boundary which parts Meath from Kilmore is\r\nvery different from the line which the fathers of Rathbreasail drew\r\nbetween the dioceses of Clonard and Duleek, or that which the assembly\r\nof Usnagh drew between Clonmacnoise and Clonard.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV.--St. Malachy's Part in The Reformation\r\n\r\nIt is not possible, within the limits of this Introduction, to follow\r\nthe later stages of the Reformation movement in detail. In the present\r\nsection I confine myself to the part which St. Malachy played in its\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nMalachy was born at Armagh in 1095. He was therefore a mere boy when the\r\nSynod of Rathbreasail met. At the dawn of his manhood he became the\r\ndisciple of the recluse Imar O'Hagan. Imar was in sympathy with the aims\r\nof the reformers, and it was probably through his influence that Malachy\r\nbecame imbued with their principles. He soon attracted the notice of\r\nCellach, and was by him ordained deacon. He was advanced to the\r\npriesthood about 1119. Shortly afterwards Cellach made the young priest\r\nhis vicar. For the next year or two it was Malachy's duty to administer\r\nthe diocese of Armagh; and he did so in the most effective--indeed\r\nrevolutionary--fashion. He evidently let no man despise his youth. His\r\npurpose, as his biographer tells us, was \"to root out barbarous rites,\r\nto plant the rites of the Church.\" \"He established in all the churches\r\nthe apostolic sanctions and the decrees of the holy fathers, and\r\nespecially the customs of the Holy Roman Church.\" He introduced the\r\nRoman method of chanting the services of the canonical hours. \"He\r\ninstituted anew Confession, Confirmation, the Marriage contract, of all\r\nof which those over whom he was placed were either ignorant or\r\nnegligent.\" In a word, Malachy showed himself an ardent reformer.[71]\r\n\r\nOne wonders how, even with the assistance of Cellach and Imar, a young\r\nman who had never left Armagh could have already become sufficiently\r\nacquainted with the usages of other churches to carry out these sweeping\r\nmeasures. Perhaps his zeal was not always according to knowledge. But he\r\nsoon became aware of his limitations, and determined to seek\r\ninstruction. With the consent of Cellach and Imar he betook himself to\r\nMalchus, who had by this time retired from the archbishopric of Cashel\r\nand was settled at Lismore. There Malachy spent three years. During that\r\nperiod he doubtless increased his knowledge of Roman customs and\r\nprinciples. But he did more. Cormac MacCarthy, son of the king of\r\nDesmond, was then a refugee in the monastery of Malchus. Between Cormac\r\nand Malachy there grew up a friendship, which proved in later years of\r\nmuch advantage to the reforming cause.[72]\r\n\r\nBut at length Malachy's presence was urgently needed in the north, and\r\nhe was recalled by Cellach and Imar. What had happened was this. The\r\ncoarb of St. Comgall at Bangor, the principal religious site in the\r\nnorth-east of Ireland, had lately died. Since he ended his days at\r\nLismore, it may be assumed that he was a friend of Malchus, and of the\r\nmovement with which he was identified. At any rate his successor, who\r\nwas Malachy's uncle, expressed his willingness to surrender his office\r\nand the site of the monastery to his nephew.[73] Here was an opportunity\r\nto carry into effect one of the canons of Rathbreasail, which had\r\nhitherto been a dead letter, by establishing the diocese of Connor.\r\nCellach, duly elected coarb of Patrick, and consecrated bishop, had no\r\ndoubt been able to organize the diocese of Armagh in accordance with the\r\nRathbreasail scheme. In like manner such a man as Malachy, enjoying the\r\nprestige which belonged to the coarb of Comgall, if consecrated bishop,\r\nwould probably succeed in organizing the diocese of Connor. So in 1124\r\nMalachy journeyed to Bangor, was installed as abbot, and was made bishop\r\nby Cellach.[74] He administered his diocese with the same vigour which\r\nhad already characterized his work at Armagh. But it is interesting to\r\nobserve how closely he conformed to the old Irish type of bishop, in\r\nspite of his Roman proclivities. At heart he was far less bishop of\r\nConnor than coarb of Comgall, abbot of Bangor. Indeed, in strictness, he\r\nhad no right to the title \"bishop of Connor\"; for Connor was not his\r\nsee. He made Bangor his headquarters.[75] Doubtless Malachy preferred\r\nBangor to the nominal see, because it was consecrated by centuries of\r\nsacred memories, and because as yet he could not place the office of\r\nbishop above that of abbot. He ruled his great newly formed diocese, or\r\nas much of it as he succeeded in ruling, from its remotest corner on the\r\nsea shore, as Aidan ruled Northumbria from Holy Island. There he lived\r\namong his brethren, of whom he gathered a great company. There was no\r\nprovision for his mensa, for he was \"a lover of poverty.\" He practised\r\naustere asceticism. Yet he was an active missionary. He travelled\r\nincessantly through the diocese, but always on foot, visiting the towns,\r\nand roaming about the country parts, surrounded by his disciples. He\r\npreached to the people whom he met on his way.[76] Nothing could be\r\nmore unlike a medieval bishop of the ordinary kind. At every point we\r\nare reminded of the labours of Aidan and Ceadd and Cedd as they are\r\ndescribed by Bede. But we may be sure that it was precisely because\r\nMalachy was coarb of Bangor, because he lived according to the ancient\r\nIrish ideal of sainthood, that he secured the obedience of the people of\r\nhis diocese.\r\n\r\nIn such work as I have mentioned Malachy was engaged from 1124 to 1127.\r\nIn the latter year he was driven out of Bangor by Conor O'Loughlin, king\r\nof the north of Ireland, and a second time betook himself to Lismore.\r\nThere he again met Cormac MacCarthy, for that unfortunate prince was\r\nonce more taking sanctuary with Malchus. He had succeeded a little while\r\nbefore to the throne of Desmond, but had been driven out by Turlough\r\nO'Conor, who made his brother king in his stead. But after a few months,\r\npersuaded by the entreaties of Malchus and Malachy, and aided by the\r\narms of Conor O'Brien, king of Thomond, a nephew of Murtough, Anselm's\r\ncorrespondent, he made a successful attempt to regain his kingdom.[77]\r\nThen Malachy moved on to Iveragh in the County Kerry, and there, under\r\nCormac's patronage, he founded a new monastery for his community.[78]\r\nOnce again Cormac has friendly intercourse with Malachy, and another\r\nO'Brien is on good terms with the reformers.\r\n\r\nIt was at Iveragh, two years later, that Malachy received news of the\r\ndeath of Archbishop Cellach.[79] It was an announcement which must have\r\ncaused great anxiety to him and his friends. Who was to succeed to the\r\nprimacy?\r\n\r\nThe importance of the question will become manifest if we recall the\r\nprogress which had already been made at Armagh, and what still remained\r\nto be done. When Cellach was elected abbot in 1105, and in the following\r\nyear was consecrated bishop, a great point had been gained. For the\r\nfirst time for 150 years the church of Armagh had a bishop as its ruler.\r\nWe may suppose that Cellach soon organized the diocese, the limits of\r\nwhich were fixed at Rathbreasail. But whatever Gilbert or Malchus might\r\nhold as to the source of his authority, we cannot imagine that the\r\nmembers of the Church in the diocese based their allegiance to him on\r\nany other ground than the fact that he was their abbot and the coarb of\r\nPatrick. That he was a bishop added nothing, in their view, to his\r\nclaims. Moreover Cellach belonged to the family which had long supplied\r\nArmagh with abbots. The abuse of hereditary succession had not\r\ndisappeared with his appointment.[80] If his successor was chosen in the\r\ntime-honoured way, a member of the coarbial family would certainly be\r\nselected, and in all probability he would be a layman, who would not\r\naccept episcopal orders. In a word, all that had been achieved by the\r\nreformers at the most important ecclesiastical centre in Ireland would\r\nbe undone.\r\n\r\nCellach had foreseen this, and accordingly he determined to nominate\r\nMalachy as his successor. \"With the authority of Patrick\" he laid upon\r\nthe nobles, and especially upon \"the two kings of Munster,\" the\r\nobligation of securing that his wish should be carried into effect. The\r\ntwo kings who were thus charged with a difficult duty were Conor\r\nO'Brien, king of Thomond, the principal representative of the O'Briens,\r\nand Cormac MacCarthy, king of Desmond, Malachy's friend.\r\n\r\nFrom Cellach's point of view the choice of a successor which he had made\r\nwas a wise one. Malachy was as zealous a reformer as himself. He was a\r\nman of unusual ability and force of character. Besides, he was\r\npossessed of a personal charm which might in time disarm opposition. He\r\nwas already a bishop; therefore, if he were once seated in the chair of\r\nPatrick, the question whether the new coarb should be consecrated would\r\nnot arise. More important still, he was not of the coarbial stock; with\r\nhis entry into the see the scandal of hereditary succession would come\r\nto an end.\r\n\r\nBut it was not to be expected that the appointment would be accepted\r\nwithout strong protest; and at the moment there seemed little prospect\r\nthat the scheme of Cellach would attain fruition. There is no need to\r\nenter into the details of the fierce struggle that ensued. It is dealt\r\nwith elsewhere.[81] Suffice it to say that by 1137, with the aid of\r\nO'Brien and MacCarthy, and apparently with assistance also from Donough\r\nO'Carroll, king of Oriel, he was undisputed coarb of Patrick and\r\narchbishop of Armagh. The victory was won, and an immense stride had\r\nbeen made in the Reformation movement.\r\n\r\nBut Malachy had no mind to spend the rest of his life at Armagh. Five\r\nyears before, as the condition of his entry into the fray, he had\r\nstipulated that as soon as he had been accepted as archbishop he should\r\nresign the see and return to his beloved Bangor. So in 1137 he nominated\r\nand consecrated Gelasius as his successor in the primacy, and \"returned\r\nto his former parish, but not to Connor.\" Let me explain this\r\nenigmatical statement. Malachy had had some years' experience of the\r\npeople of the diocese of Connor, whom St. Bernard gently describes as\r\n\"not men but beasts.\" He had doubtless discovered that the district\r\nwhich it included could not be ruled by a single bishop. In fact it\r\nconsisted of two tribal territories, Dál Araide in the north, and Ulaid\r\nin the south; and the two tribes which inhabited them were usually\r\nengaged in mutual war. He decided that it should be divided into two\r\ndioceses. He consecrated a bishop for Dál Araide, with his see at\r\nConnor, and himself resumed the oversight of Ulaid, with his see at\r\nBangor.[82] Thus originated the present dioceses of Down and Connor. In\r\nMalachy's time the boundary between them seems to have run west from\r\nLarne. In the course of centuries it has shifted further south.\r\n\r\nThis division was a direct violation of the letter of the ordinance of\r\nRathbreasail; but it did not contravene its spirit. In the letter, which\r\nignored the civil divisions of the country, the ordinance could not be\r\nobeyed. Malachy adopted a scheme which secured the permanent rule of\r\ndiocesan bishops in the district.\r\n\r\nMalachy was now, and continued to be till his death, bishop of Down, or\r\nmore strictly of Bangor; in the current Irish phrase bishop of Ulaid.\r\nBut his activities already extended beyond his diocese. Within the next\r\ntwo years he succeeded in establishing in actual fact another diocese\r\nwhich till now had existed only on paper. It was that which the Synod of\r\nRathbreasail had called the diocese of Clogher, and which we know by the\r\nsame name; but which for sixty years or more bore the name of the\r\ndiocese of Oriel.\r\n\r\nThat we may understand his action let us return for a moment to the five\r\nUlster dioceses as planned at Rathbreasail. In four of them regard was\r\npaid to tribal boundaries. The diocese of Raphoe corresponded to Tír\r\nConaill, Derry to Tír Eoghain, Armagh to Oriel, while Connor\r\ncomprehended the two territories of Dál Araide and Ulaid. The diocese of\r\nClogher was of necessity the remainder of the province. If it coincided\r\nwith a tribal district, that could only happen by chance. In fact it did\r\nnot. It was much smaller than the other dioceses. It embraced only the\r\npresent barony of Clogher in the county of Tyrone, and the portion of\r\nFermanagh lying between it and the Erne waterway. It had within it no\r\nelement of cohesion. It was most unlikely that it could ever constitute\r\nan ecclesiastical unit, governed by a bishop.\r\n\r\nNevertheless an attempt seems to have been made to consolidate it as a\r\ndiocese a few years after Rathbreasail; as might have been expected,\r\nwithout success. A bishop of Clogher, who apparently had no diocese,\r\ndied in 1135. He was succeeded by Christian O'Morgair, brother of\r\nMalachy. He was probably nominated and consecrated by his brother, who\r\nwas then titular archbishop of Armagh. Now about this time Donough\r\nO'Carroll, king of Oriel, joined the ranks of the reformers, as we may\r\nsuppose under the influence of Malachy. His kingdom included the little\r\ndiocese of Clogher; but the main part of it consisted of the present\r\ncounties of Monaghan and Louth. Accordingly a bold stroke of policy was\r\nconceived and carried out. The diocese of Clogher was enlarged so as to\r\ncover the greater part of O'Carroll's kingdom. For this purpose the\r\narchbishop of Armagh surrendered a large part of his diocese--the whole\r\nof Monaghan and Louth. Then Christian moved his see from Clogher to the\r\nspot now occupied by the village of Louth. Thus there was constituted a\r\nnew diocese, which included the Rathbreasail diocese of Clogher, but was\r\nfour times its size, and had its see at Louth. It was known as the\r\ndiocese of Oriel. In all this we see plainly the hand of Malachy. Not\r\nlong after the removal of the see Christian died, and Malachy selected\r\nand consecrated his successor, one Edan O'Kelly. O'Kelly had a long\r\nepiscopate, from 1139 to 1182; and with the help of O'Carroll he\r\norganized his diocese, and gave it a cathedral at Louth with a chapter\r\nof Augustinian canons.[83] Once again Malachy was the maker of a\r\ndiocese; and once again, in the interest of stability, he transgressed\r\nthe letter of the Rathbreasail canons, while fulfilling their spirit. It\r\nwas not till after the coming of the Anglo-Normans that the see was\r\nbrought back to Clogher. Subsequently the county of Louth reverted to\r\nArmagh, and the diocese extended to the west. About the year 1250 its\r\nboundaries came to be what they now are.[84]\r\n\r\nIn 1139, after settling the affairs of the diocese of Oriel, Malachy\r\nleft Ireland on an important mission. It will be remembered that Gilbert\r\nhad declared that no archbishop could exercise his functions till the\r\nPope had sent him the pall. That was the current doctrine of the age.\r\nNow neither Cellach, nor Malachy, nor Gelasius, nor Malchus, nor his\r\nsuccessor at Cashel, had received that ornament. They had therefore, in\r\nthe strict sense, no right to the title of archbishop. Malachy resolved\r\nto make request to the Pope in person for palls for the two Irish\r\nmetropolitans. So he set out from Bangor for Rome.[85] Of his journey it\r\nis unnecessary to say anything here.[86]\r\n\r\nAt Rome Malachy was received by Pope Innocent II. with great honour. He\r\nconfirmed the erection of the metropolitan see of Cashel. But he\r\npolitely declined to grant the palls. They must be demanded, he said, by\r\na council of the bishops, clergy and magnates; and then they would be\r\ngiven.\r\n\r\nBut if the Pope refused Malachy's request, he bestowed on him an office,\r\nthe securing of which we may conjecture to have been one of the purposes\r\nof his visit to Rome, though St. Bernard does not say so. Gilbert, now\r\nold and infirm, had resigned the see of Limerick, and with it his\r\nlegatine commission. Innocent made Malachy papal legate in his\r\nstead.[87]\r\n\r\nThus Malachy returned to Ireland, still bishop of Down indeed, but\r\nvirtually chief prelate of the Irish Church. For the following eight\r\nyears he laboured with zeal and vigour. St. Bernard unfortunately gives\r\nlittle information concerning the details of his administrative work as\r\nlegate. But he relates one incident which suggests that in this period\r\nMalachy was instrumental in founding another diocese. He nominated and\r\nconsecrated the first known bishop of Cork,[88] not improbably with the\r\nintention that he should unite in his own person the two offices of\r\ncoarb of Barre, founder of Cork, and diocesan bishop.\r\n\r\nAnd in this connexion it is worth noticing that he was evidently on\r\nfriendly terms with Nehemiah, the first known bishop of the neighbouring\r\ndiocese of Cloyne.[89] If that diocese was also founded by him he once\r\nagain violated the letter of the Rathbreasail canons, for by them Cloyne\r\nwas included in the diocese of Emly.\r\n\r\nIn 1148 Malachy convened a synod at Inispatrick, an island opposite\r\nSkerries, Co. Dublin. This synod demanded the palls in due form, and\r\nsent Malachy to obtain them. But he got no further on his journey than\r\nClairvaux. There, after celebrating Mass on St. Luke's Day, he was taken\r\nill of a fever; and there a fortnight later he died in the arms of St.\r\nBernard, on All Souls' Day, 2nd November, 1148.[90]\r\n\r\nNevertheless the palls came. They were brought to Ireland by a legate\r\nspecially commissioned by Pope Eugenius III., John Paparo, cardinal\r\npriest of St. Laurence. A synod was held at Kells to receive them in\r\nMarch 1152,[91] of which the joint presidents were Paparo, as _legatus a\r\nlatere_, and Christian, first abbot of Mellifont, and now bishop of\r\nLismore, who had lately succeeded Malachy as _legatus natus_.\r\n\r\nOf this synod Keating gives a short account, abridged from the _Annals\r\nof Clonenagh_,[92] from which he had also derived his knowledge of the\r\nproceedings at Rathbreasail. He preserves a list of the bishops who\r\nattended. It includes twenty-two names, if we count two vicars who\r\nrepresented absent bishops. There were besides, as Keating informs us,\r\nfive bishops-elect. And there was certainly one bishop of a diocese who\r\nwas neither present nor represented, Edan O'Kelly, bishop of Oriel. So\r\nit appears that in 1152 there were at least twenty-eight dioceses in\r\nIreland--a number considerably larger than was contemplated at\r\nRathbreasail. The increase in number is partly accounted for by the\r\npresence of the bishop of the recently formed diocese of Kilmore, the\r\ndivision of the diocese of Connor into Connor and Down, and, a most\r\nstriking addition, the inclusion of Gregory, bishop of Dublin, among the\r\nassembled prelates. It is remarkable that the bishop of Kells is not\r\nmentioned, though the synod was held in his own city. How was the bishop\r\nof Dublin induced to throw in his lot with the Irish Church? We shall\r\nsee in a moment.\r\n\r\nMuch business was transacted at this Synod. But that which concerns us\r\nmost nearly is the giving of the palls. Cardinal Paparo brought the\r\nIrish bishops more than they had asked for; more indeed than they\r\ndesired. He presented, not two palls but four, Dublin and Tuam, as well\r\nas Armagh and Cashel, being recognized as archiepiscopal sees. This\r\nexcessive generosity caused much displeasure among the Irish bishops.\r\n\"For Ireland,\" says Keating, apparently paraphrasing the _Annals of\r\nClonenagh_, \"thought it enough to have a pall in the church of Armagh\r\nand a pall in Cashel; and particularly it was in spite of the church of\r\nArmagh and the church of Down that the other palls were given.\" The\r\ncause of this discontent is not far to seek. The chief gravamen no doubt\r\nwas that Dublin was included among the four. The constant friction which\r\nhad subsisted for many years between the diocese of Dublin and the Irish\r\nChurch sufficiently explains the indignation of the archbishop of\r\nArmagh, aggravated by the fact that the creation of new archbishops\r\nimposed a limit upon his authority. It also enables us to understand why\r\nhis displeasure was shared by the Irish generally. That a see whose\r\nbishops had behaved so haughtily in the past should, at the very moment\r\nof its entrance into the Irish Church, receive so signal an honour, long\r\ndenied to Armagh and Cashel, and that in the person of its bishop it\r\nshould be given jurisdiction over bishops whom till now it had treated\r\nwith contempt, could not but be regarded as unreasonable, or even\r\ninsulting. But on the other hand, recalling the early history of the\r\nChurch in Dublin, we can comprehend why, in spite of all this, special\r\nfavour was bestowed upon it. Dublin, as we have seen, was a not too\r\nsubmissive suffragan of Canterbury. Its ambition was that its bishop\r\nshould have the status of a metropolitan. The opportunity had come for\r\ngratifying its desire, and at the same time bringing it under the Irish\r\necclesiastical régime. The pall at once separated it from Canterbury and\r\nunited it with Ireland. It was the price paid for its submission to the\r\nPrimacy of Armagh. Gregory therefore became archbishop of Dublin, and\r\nhad the right--which his predecessor had long before illegally\r\nassumed--to have the cross carried before him. With the gift of the pall\r\nPaparo bestowed upon him \"the principal part of the bishopric of\r\nGlendalough as his diocese,\" promising him the remainder on the death of\r\nthe bishop who then ruled it. All this was done, we are told, because it\r\nwas fitting that the place \"in which from ancient time had been the\r\nroyal seat and head of Ireland,\" should be made a metropolitan see.[93]\r\n\r\nThere was at last one Church in Ireland, which embraced within it not\r\nonly the Celtic parts of the island, but all the Danish dioceses as\r\nwell. And the whole Church was ruled by the bishops. The Reformation may\r\nnot have been complete in every detail--there was indeed much left for\r\nthe Anglo-Normans to do--but the Synod of Kells had set the crown on the\r\nwork of the Irish reformers. And this consummation was mainly due to the\r\nwisdom and the untiring zeal of St. Malachy of Armagh.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nA few words more will suffice to complete this too lengthy\r\nintroduction. The _Life of Malachy_ was certainly written before the\r\nSynod of Kells met in March 1152; for Christian, who attended the Synod\r\nas bishop of Lismore, is spoken of in the _Life_ as abbot of\r\nMellifont.[94] Its earliest possible date is a couple of months after\r\nMalachy's death. The ignorance displayed in § 69[95] of the movements of\r\nthe Pope in 1148 is so inexplicable on the assumption of a later date\r\nthat it may be assigned to January 1149.[96] In the following\r\ntranslation the text printed by de Backer[97] is used, with the\r\nexception of a few sentences which have been emended. It does not differ\r\nto any great extent from that of Mabillon.[98] Following de Backer I\r\nhave divided the text into chapters, in accordance with the MSS.; but\r\nMabillon's sections have been retained, as more convenient for\r\nreference, the numbers of de Backer's sections being added within\r\nbrackets.\r\n\r\nBy way of illustration four letters of St. Bernard and his two sermons\r\non St. Malachy have been added. They are translated from Mabillon's\r\nedition,[99] with some corrections. The dates of these documents are\r\ndiscussed below.[100]\r\n\r\nSt. Bernard's numerous quotations from the Bible and other sources are\r\nprinted in italics, so far as I have recognized them. The scriptural\r\nallusions are given as nearly as possible in the words of the Authorized\r\n(in the Apocryphal books the Revised) Version, though at times they do\r\nnot agree with the Vulgate Latin. Where it has been found necessary to\r\ndepart from their renderings, the symbol \"vg.\" follows the references in\r\nthe footnotes.\r\n\r\nI desire to make grateful acknowledgement of help received from my\r\nfriends, of whom I must specially mention Dr. L. C. Purser, Senior\r\nFellow of Trinity College, Dublin, Mr. R. I. Best, the Rev. J. E. L.\r\nOulton, the Rev. Dr. J. M. Harden and the Rev. Canon C. P. Price.

Gougaud (p. 358) infers from this passage\r\nthat Limerick was at that time a suffragan see of Canterbury. But this\r\nseems impossible in view of Gilbert's share in the proceedings of the\r\nSynod of Rathbreasail five years earlier. Eadmer is not a very good\r\nwitness in such matters, and his language is hardly decisive for two\r\nreasons. (1) It is not clear that he includes Gilbert among the\r\nsuffragans who co-operated in the consecration: \"Huic consecrationi\r\ninterfuerunt et cooperatores extiterunt suffraganei ecclesiae\r\nCantuariensis, episcopi videlicet hi, Willelmus Wintoniensis, Robertus\r\nLincoliensis, Rogerus Serberiensis, Johannes Bathoniensis, Urbanus\r\nGlamorgatensis, Gislebertus Lumniensis de Hibernia.\" (2) The word\r\n\"suffragan\" is often used as meaning merely an assistant bishop. Thus\r\nin the fifteenth century several bishops of Dromore were \"suffragans\"\r\nof the archbishop of York; but Dromore was certainly not regarded as\r\none of his suffragan sees.\r\n\r\n[23] Ussher, 532.\r\n\r\n[24] See p. xxxvi.\r\n\r\n[25] Ussher, 567; _Beati Lanfranci Opera_, ed.

(1846), p.\r\n136.\r\n\r\n[30] Wilkins, _Concilia_, i. 547. In the form in which Rochfort quotes\r\nit the ordinance applies to the whole of Ireland. But we have no\r\nevidence of the transformation of dioceses into deaneries outside\r\nMeath; and it is quite probable that a synod held in Meath would have\r\nin view, in such a decree, only the conditions which prevailed in that\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\n[31] The deanery of Dunshaughlin is now named Ratoath. The deanery of\r\nKells has been divided into Upper and Lower Kells.\r\n\r\n[32] The cogency of this argument is enhanced when we observe that\r\nthere is strong independent evidence for the existence in the twelfth\r\ncentury of one of the six dioceses--the diocese of Kells. (_a_) Up to\r\nthe latter part of the sixteenth century (1583) there was an\r\narchdeacon of Kells, as well as an archdeacon of Meath; the\r\njurisdiction of an archdeacon (at any rate in Ireland) seems to have\r\nbeen always originally co-extensive with a diocese. The first known\r\narchdeacon of Kells was Adam Petit who was in office in 1230 (_R.T.A._\r\n279; _C.M.A._ i. 101); but it is unlikely that he had no predecessors.\r\n(_b_) Among the prelates who greeted Henry II. at Dublin in 1171 was\r\nThaddaeus, bishop of Kells (Benedict of Peterborough (R. S.), i. 26).\r\n(_c_) In the time of Innocent III. (1198-1216) the question was raised\r\nin the papal curia whether the bishop of Kells was subject to the\r\narchbishop of Armagh or the archbishop of Tuam (Theiner, p. 2). (_d_)\r\nThe bishop of Kells is mentioned in a document of the year 1202 (_Cal.\r\nof Docts. Ireland_, i. 168). (_e_) A contemporary note records the\r\nsuppression of the bishopric: \"When a Cistercian monk ... had been\r\nelected and consecrated bishop of Kells by the common consent of the\r\nclergy and people, and had been confirmed by the Pope, the impudent\r\nbishop of Meath cast him out with violence and dared to [add] his\r\nbishopric to his own\" (_C.M.A._ ii. 22). This statement implies that\r\nthe dispossessed bishop ruled over a diocese. Moreover, when we\r\nremember that the see was certainly suppressed before Rochfort's Synod\r\nof 1216, that Rochfort was the first person who assumed the title\r\n\"bishop of Meath\" in the modern sense, and that a bishop of Kells died\r\nin 1211 (_A.L.C._), we need not hesitate to conclude that the\r\n\"impudent bishop\" was Rochfort himself, and that the suppression was\r\naccomplished about 1213.\r\n\r\n[33] _I.e._ dioceses. This synod is mentioned in _A.T._, _A.I._ and\r\nthe _Annals of Boyle_. Particulars of its Acts and of the persons\r\npresent at it are given in _C.S._ and _D.A.I._ _C.S._ has \"parish\" in\r\nthe singular. But this does not seem to yield good sense; for the\r\nwhole extent of the kingdom of Meath could scarcely have been called a\r\n\"parish\" in the twelfth century. I therefore read \"parishes.\" The\r\nsingular may have been substituted for the plural at a later time,\r\nwhen the kingdom (or the greater part of it) included only the\r\ndioceses of Meath and Clonmacnoise, and their earlier history was\r\nforgotten. Cp. the unhistorical statement of St. Bernard about Down\r\nand Connor in _Life_, § 31. _D.A.I._ have an anomalous form\r\n(_faircheadh_), which may have come from either the singular\r\n(_fairche_) or the plural (_faircheadha_) in the exemplar, but more\r\nprobably from the latter.\r\n\r\n[34] p. xxiv. f.\r\n\r\n[35] See p. 47, note 3.\r\n\r\n[36] Ussher, 513.\r\n\r\n[37] A small portion of the present diocese of Limerick lies north of\r\nthe Shannon.\r\n\r\n[38] Ussher, 501 ff.; _P.L._ clix. 995.\r\n\r\n[39] See p. 65, note 1.\r\n\r\n[40] See Additional Note B, pp. 164, 166.

MALACHY\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE\r\n\r\n\r\n1. It is indeed always worth while to portray the illustrious lives of\r\nthe saints, that they may serve as a mirror and an example, and give, as\r\nit were, a relish to the life of men on earth. For by this means in some\r\nsort they _live_ among us, even _after death_,[101] and many of those\r\nwho _are dead while they live_[102] are challenged and recalled by them\r\nto true life. But now especially is there need for it because holiness\r\nis rare, and it is plain that our age is lacking in men. So greatly, in\r\ntruth, do we perceive that lack to have increased in our day that none\r\ncan doubt that we are smitten by that saying, _Because iniquity shall\r\nabound the love of many shall wax cold_;[103] and, as I suppose, he has\r\ncome or is at hand of whom it is written, _Want shall go before his\r\nface_.[104] If I mistake not, Antichrist is he whom famine and sterility\r\nof all good both precedes and accompanies. Whether therefore it is the\r\nherald of one now present or the harbinger of one who shall come\r\nimmediately, the _want_ is evident. I speak not of the crowd, I speak\r\nnot of the vile multitude of _the children of this world_:[105] I would\r\nhave you lift up your eyes upon the very _pillars_[106] of the Church.\r\nWhom can you show me, even of the number of those who seem to be _given\r\nfor a light to the Gentiles_,[107] that in his lofty station is not\r\nrather a smoking wick than a blazing lamp? And, says One, _if the light\r\nthat is in thee be darkness, how great is that darkness_![108] Unless\r\nperchance, which I do not believe, you will say that they shine who\r\n_suppose that gain is godliness_;[109] who in the Lord's inheritance\r\n_seek not the things which are_ the Lord's, but rather _their own_.[110]\r\nWhy do I say _their own_? He would be perfect and holy, even while he\r\nseeks his own and retains his own, who should restrain his heart and\r\nhands from the things of others. But let him remember, who seems to\r\nhimself to have advanced perhaps thus far, that the same degree of\r\nholiness is demanded even of a gentile.[111] Are not _soldiers_ bidden\r\nto _be content with their wages_ that they may be saved?[112] But it is\r\na great thing for a doctor of the Church if he be as one of the\r\nsoldiers; or, _if_, in truth (as the prophet speaks to their reproach),\r\n_it be as with the people so with the priest_.[113] Hideous! Is it so\r\nindeed? Is he rightly to be esteemed highest who, falling from the\r\nhighest rank can scarce cleave to the lowest, that he be not engulfed in\r\nthe abyss? Yet how rare is even such a man among the clergy! Whom,\r\nlikewise, do you give me who is content with necessaries, who despises\r\nsuperfluities? Yet the law has been enjoined beforehand by the Apostles\r\non the successors of the Apostles, _Having_ food _and_ raiment, _let us\r\nbe therewith content_.[114] Where is this rule? We see it in books, but\r\nnot in men. But you have [the saying] about the righteous man, that _the\r\nlaw of his God is in his heart_,[115] not in a codex. Nor is that the\r\nstandard of perfection. The perfect man is ready to forgo even\r\nnecessaries. But that is beside the mark.[116] Would that some limit\r\nwere set on superfluous things! Would that our desires were not\r\ninfinite! But what? Perhaps you might find one who can achieve this. It\r\nwould indeed be difficult; but [if we find him] see what we have done.\r\nWe were seeking for a very good man, a deliverer of many; and lo, we\r\nhave labour to discover one who can save himself. The very good man\r\nto-day is one who is not utterly bad.\r\n\r\n2. Wherefore, _since the godly man has ceased_[117] from the earth, it\r\nseems to me that I do not employ myself to no purpose when I recall to\r\nour midst, from among those _who were redeemed from the earth_,[118]\r\nBishop Malachy, a man truly holy, and a man, too, of our own time, of\r\nsingular wisdom and virtue. _He was a burning and a shining light_;[119]\r\nand it has not been quenched, but only removed. Who would with good\r\nright be angry with me if I move it back again? Yes indeed, neither the\r\nmen of my own age, nor any succeeding generation should be wanting in\r\ngratitude to me if by my pen I recall one whom the course of nature has\r\nborne away; if I restore to the world one _of whom the world was not\r\nworthy_;[120] if I preserve for the memory of men one _whose memory may\r\nbe blessed_[121] to all who shall deign to read; if while I rouse my\r\nsleeping friend, _the voice of the turtle be heard in our land_[122]\r\nsaying, _Lo, I am with you alway, even unto the end of the world_.[123]\r\nThen again, he was buried among us;[124] this duty is eminently ours.\r\nNay, is it not mine, inasmuch as that holy man included me among his\r\nspecial friends, and in such regard that I may believe that I was second\r\nto none _in that respect of glory_?[125] Nor do I find that intercourse\r\nwith holiness so eminent misses its reward; I have already received the\r\nfirst-fruits. He was near the end; nay, rather, near the beginning,\r\naccording to the saying, _when a man hath finished then is he but at the\r\nbeginning_.[126] I ran to him that _the blessing of him that was ready\r\nto_ die might _come upon me_.[127] Already he could not move his other\r\nlimbs; but, mighty to give blessing, he raised his hands upon my head\r\nand blessed me.[128] I have _inherited the blessing_;[129] how then can\r\nI be silent about him? Finally, you enjoin me to undertake this task,\r\nAbbot Congan,[130] my reverend brother and sweet friend, and with you\r\nalso (as you write from Ireland) _all_ that _Church of the saints_[131]\r\nto which you belong.[132] I obey with a will, the more so because you\r\nask not panegyric but narrative. I shall endeavour that it may be\r\nchaste and clear, informing the devout, and not wearying the fastidious.\r\nAt any rate the truth of my narrative is assured, since it has been\r\ncommunicated by you;[133] and beyond doubt you assert nothing but things\r\nof which you have most certain information.\r\n\r\n_Here ends the Prologue._\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[101] Ecclus. xlviii. 12 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[102] 1 Tim. v. 6.

He may\r\ntherefore be identified with Congan, abbot of the Cistercian monastery\r\nof the Suir, mentioned in § 64. That he was personally known to St.\r\nBernard is clear; and it is probable that he was one of the Irishmen\r\nwho by Malachy's desire were instructed at Clairvaux (§ 39). Thady\r\nDowling (_Annals_, _s.a._ 1147) identifies him with \"Cogganus,\" abbot\r\nof Killeshin, near Carlow, stating on the authority of Nicholas\r\nMaguire that he wrote the _gesta_ of Malachy and Bernard.

Having been admitted to Holy Orders he\r\nassociates with Malchus_\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1095.]\r\n\r\n1. Our Malachy, born in Ireland,[134] of a barbarous people, was brought\r\nup there, and there received his education. But from the barbarism of\r\nhis birth he contracted no taint, any more than the fishes of the sea\r\nfrom their native salt. But how delightful to reflect, that uncultured\r\nbarbarism should have produced for us so worthy[135] _a fellow-citizen\r\nwith the saints and member of the household of God_.[136] He who brings\r\n_honey out of the rock and oil out of the flinty rock_[137] Himself did\r\nthis. His parents,[138] however, were great both by descent and in\r\npower, _like unto the name of the great men that are in the earth_.[139]\r\nMoreover his mother,[140] more noble in mind than in blood, took pains,\r\n_in the very beginning of his ways_,[141] _to show_ to her child _the\r\nways of life_,[142] esteeming this knowledge of more value to him than\r\nthe empty knowledge of the learning of this world. For both, however, he\r\nhad aptitude in proportion to his age. In the schools _he was taught_\r\nlearning, at home _the fear of the Lord_,[143] and by daily progress he\r\nduly responded to both teacher and mother.[144] For indeed he was\r\nendowed from the first with a _good spirit_,[145] in virtue of which he\r\nwas a docile boy and very lovable, wonderfully gracious to all in all\r\nthings. But he was [now] drinking, instead of milk from the breast of a\r\nmother, _the waters of saving wisdom_,[146] and day by day he was\r\nincreasing in discretion. In discretion, shall I say, or in holiness? If\r\nI say both, I shall not regret it, _for I should say the truth_.[147] He\r\nbehaved as an old man, a boy in years without a boy's playfulness. And\r\nwhen because of this he was regarded with reverence and astonishment by\r\nall, he was not found on that account, as commonly happens, more\r\narrogant, but rather quiet and subdued in _all meekness_.[148] Not\r\nimpatient of rule, not shunning discipline, not averse from reading,\r\nnot, therefore, eager for games--so especially dear to the heart of boys\r\nof that age. _And he advanced beyond all of his own age_[149] in that\r\nlearning, at least, which suited his years. For in discipline of morals\r\nand advance in virtues in a short time he even outshone _all his\r\ninstructors_.[150] His _unction_,[151] however, rather than his mother,\r\nwas his teacher. Urged by it he exercised himself not slothfully also in\r\ndivine things, to seek solitude, _to anticipate vigils_,[152] to\r\n_meditate in the law_,[153] to eat sparingly, to pray frequently, and\r\n(because on account of his studies he had not leisure to frequent the\r\nchurch, and from modesty would not) to _lift up holy hands\r\neverywhere_[154] to heaven; but only where it could be done\r\nsecretly--for already he was careful to avoid vainglory, that poison of\r\nvirtues.[155]\r\n\r\n2. There is a hamlet near the city in which the boy studied,[156]\r\nwhither his teacher was wont to go often, accompanied by him alone. When\r\nthey were going there both together, as he related afterwards, he would\r\n_step back, stop a moment_,[157] and standing behind his teacher, when\r\nhe was not aware of it, _spread forth his hands toward heaven_,[158] and\r\nquickly send forth a prayer, as if it were a dart; and, thus\r\ndissembling, once more would follow the teacher. By such a pious trick\r\nthe boy often deceived him who was his companion as well as teacher. It\r\nis not possible to mention all the qualities which adorned his earlier\r\nyears with the hue of a good natural disposition; we must hasten to\r\ngreater and more useful matters. One further incident, however, I\r\nrelate because, in my judgement, it yielded a sign, not only of good,\r\nbut also of great hope in the boy. Roused once on a time by the\r\nreputation of a certain teacher, famous in the studies which are called\r\nliberal, he went to him desiring to learn. For indeed he was now\r\ngrasping after the last opportunities of boyhood, and was longing\r\neagerly for such learning. But when he went into the house he saw the\r\nman playing with an awl, and with rapid strokes making furrows in the\r\nwall in some strange fashion. And shocked at the bare sight, because it\r\nsmacked of levity, the serious boy dashed away from him, and did not\r\ncare even to see him from that time forward. Thus, though an avid\r\nstudent of letters, as a lover of virtue he esteemed them lightly in\r\ncomparison with that which was becoming. By such preliminary exercises\r\nthe boy was being prepared for the conflict which awaited him in more\r\nadvanced[159] age; and already in his own person he was challenging the\r\nadversary. Such, then, was the boyhood of Malachy. Moreover he passed\r\nthrough his adolescence with like simplicity and purity; except that as\r\n_years_ increased, there _increased_ also for him _wisdom and favour\r\nwith God and man_.[160]\r\n\r\n3. From this time, that is, from his early adolescence, _what was in the\r\nman_[161] began to appear more plainly, and it came to be seen that _the\r\ngrace of God which was in him was not in vain_.[162] For the\r\n_industrious young man_,[163] seeing how _the world lieth in\r\nwickedness_,[164] and considering what sort of spirit _he had received_,\r\nsaid within himself, \"It is _not the spirit of this world_.[165] What\r\nhave the two in common?[166] One has no _communion_ with the other any\r\nmore than _light with darkness_.[167] But my spirit _is of God_, and _I\r\nknow the things that are freely given me_[168] in it. From it I have\r\ninnocence of life till now, from it the ornament of continence, from it\r\nhunger for _righteousness_,[169] from it also that _glory of mine_, by\r\nso much more secure because it is more secret, _the testimony of my\r\nconscience_.[170] None of these is safe for me under _the prince of this\r\nworld_.[171] Then, _I have this treasure in an earthen vessel_.[172] I\r\nmust take heed lest it should strike against something and be broken,\r\nand the _oil of gladness_[173] which I carry be poured out. And in truth\r\nit is most difficult not to strike _against something amid_ the stones\r\nand rocks _of this_ crooked and winding _way and life_.[174] Must I thus\r\nin a moment lose together all _the blessings of goodness with which_ I\r\nhave been _prevented_[175] from the beginning? Rather do I resign them,\r\nand myself with them, to Him from whom they come. Yea, and I am His. I\r\n_lose my_ very _soul_[176] for a time that I may not lose it for ever.\r\nAnd what I am and all that I have, where can they be as safe as in the\r\nhand of their Author? Who so concerned to preserve, so powerful to hold,\r\nso faithful to restore? He will preserve in safety. He will restore in\r\ngood time. Without hesitation I give myself to serve Him by His gifts. I\r\ncannot lose aught of all that I spend on my labour of piety. Perchance I\r\nmay even hope for some greater boon. He who gives freely is wont to\r\nrepay with usury. So it is. He will even heap up and _increase virtue in\r\nmy soul_.\"[177]\r\n\r\nSo he thought--and did; _knowing that_ apart from deeds _the thoughts of\r\nman are vanity_.[178]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: c. 1112.]\r\n\r\n4. (3) There was a man in the city of Armagh,[179] where Malachy was\r\nbrought up--a holy man and of great austerity of life, a pitiless\r\n_castigator of his body_,[180] who had a cell near the church.[181] In\r\nit he abode, _serving God with fastings and prayers day and night_.[182]\r\nTo this man Malachy betook himself to receive a rule[183] of life from\r\nhim, who had condemned himself while alive to such sepulture. And note\r\nhis humility. From his earliest age he had had God as his teacher--there\r\nis no doubt of it--in the art of holiness; and behold, he became once\r\nmore the disciple of a man, himself a man _meek and lowly in\r\nheart_.[184] If we did not know it, by this one deed he himself gave us\r\nproof of it. Let them read this who attempt to teach what they have not\r\nlearned, _heaping to themselves_ disciples,[185] though they have never\r\nbeen disciples, _blind leaders of the blind_.[186] Malachy, _taught of\r\nGod_,[187] none the less sought a man to be his teacher, and that\r\ncarefully and wisely. By what better method, I ask, could he both give\r\nand receive a proof of his progress? If the example of Malachy _is_ for\r\nthem _a very small thing_,[188] let them consider the action of Paul.\r\nDid not he judge that his _Gospel_, though he had _not received it of\r\nman but_ from _Christ_,[189] _should be discussed_ with men, _lest by\r\nany means he was running or had run in vain_?[190] Where he was not\r\nconfident, neither am I. If any one be thus confident[191] let him take\r\nheed lest it be not so much confidence as rashness. But these matters\r\nbelong to another time.\r\n\r\n5. Now, however, the rumour of what had happened went through the city,\r\nand it was universally stirred by this new and unexpected event. All\r\nwere amazed, and wondered at his virtue, all the more because it was\r\nunusual in a rude people. You would see that then _thoughts were being\r\nrevealed out of the hearts of many_.[192] The majority, considering the\r\nact from a human standpoint, were lamenting and grieving that a youth\r\nwho was an object of love and delight to all had given himself up to\r\nsuch severe labours. Others, suspecting lightness on account of his\r\nage, doubted whether he would persevere, and feared a fall. Some,\r\naccusing him of rashness, were in fact highly indignant with him because\r\nhe had undertaken a difficult task, beyond his age and strength, without\r\nconsulting them. But without counsel he did nothing; for he had counsel\r\nfrom the prophet who says, _It is good for a man that he bear the yoke\r\nin his youth_, and adds, _He sitteth alone and keepeth silence because\r\nhe hath borne it upon him._[193] The youth sat at the feet of Imar (for\r\nthat was the man's name) and either _learned obedience_[194] or showed\r\nthat he had learnt it. He sat as one that was at rest, as meek, as\r\nhumble. _He sat and kept silence_,[195] knowing, as the prophet says,\r\nthat _silence is the ornament of righteousness_.[196] _He sat_ as one\r\nthat perseveres, _he was silent_ as one that is modest, except that by\r\nthat silence of his he was speaking, with holy David, in the ears of\r\nGod: _I am a youth and despised, yet do not I forget thy precepts._[197]\r\nAnd for a time _he sat alone_, because he had neither companion nor\r\nexample; for who before Malachy even thought of attempting the most\r\nsevere discipline inculcated by the man? It was held by all indeed to be\r\nwonderful, but not imitable. Malachy showed that it was imitable by the\r\nmere act of sitting and keeping silence. In a few days he had imitators\r\nnot a few, stirred by his example. So he who at first _sat alone_[198]\r\nand the only son of his father, became now one of many, from being _the\r\nonly-begotten_[199] became _the firstborn among many brethren_.[200] And\r\nas he was before them in conversion,[201] so was he more sublime than\r\nthey in conversation; and he who came before all, in the judgement of\r\nall was eminent above all in virtue. And he seemed both to his\r\nbishop[202] and to his teacher,[203] worthy to be promoted to the degree\r\nof deacon. _And they constrained him._[204]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1119(?)]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1120.]\r\n\r\n6. (4) From this time onwards the Levite[205] of the Lord publicly\r\ngirded himself to every work of piety, but more especially to those\r\nthings in which there seemed some indignity. In fact it was his greatest\r\ncare to attend to the burial of the dead poor,[206] because that\r\nsavoured not less of humility than of humanity. Nor did _temptation_\r\nfail to test our modern Tobit,[207] and, as in the old story, it came\r\nfrom a woman,[208] or rather from the serpent through a woman.[209] His\r\nsister,[210] abhorring the indignity (as it seemed to her) of his\r\noffice, said: \"What are you doing, madman? _Let the dead bury their\r\ndead._\"[211] And she attacked him daily with this _reproach_.[212] But\r\nhe _answered the foolish_ woman _according to her folly_,[213] \"Wretched\r\nwoman, you preserve the sound of the _pure word_,[214] but you are\r\nignorant of its force.\" So he maintained with devotion, and exercised\r\nunweariedly the ministry which he had undertaken under compulsion. For\r\nthat reason also they[215] deemed that the office of the priesthood\r\nshould be conferred upon him. And this was done. But when he was\r\nordained priest he was about twenty-five years old.[216] And if in both\r\nhis ordinations the rule of the Canons seems to have been somewhat\r\ndisregarded--as indeed does seem to have been the case, for he received\r\nthe Levitical ministry before his twenty-fifth, and the dignity of the\r\npriesthood before his thirtieth year[217]--it may well be ascribed to\r\nthe zeal of the ordainer and the merits of him who was ordained.[218]\r\nBut for my part, I consider that such irregularity should neither be\r\ncondemned in the case of a saint, nor deliberately claimed by him who is\r\nnot a saint. Not content with this the bishop also committed to him his\r\nown authority[219] _to sow the_ holy _seed_[220] in a _nation_ which was\r\nnot _holy_,[221] and to give to a people rude and living _without\r\nlaw_,[222] the law of life and of discipline. He received the command\r\nwith all alacrity, even as he was _fervent in spirit_,[223] not\r\nhoarding up his talents, but eager for profit from them.[224] And\r\nbehold he began to _root out_ with the hoe of the tongue, _to destroy_,\r\n_to scatter_,[225] day by day making _the crooked straight and the rough\r\nplaces plain_.[226] _He rejoiced as a giant to run_ everywhere.[227] You\r\nmight call him a consuming _fire_ burning _the briers_ of crimes.[228]\r\nYou might call him _an axe_ or _a mattock casting down_[229] evil\r\nplantings.[230] He extirpated barbaric rites, he planted those of the\r\nChurch. All out-worn superstitions (for not a few of them were\r\ndiscovered) he abolished, and, wheresoever he found it, every sort of\r\nmalign influence _sent by evil angels_.[231]\r\n\r\n7. In fine whatsoever came to his notice which was irregular or\r\nunbecoming or perverse his _eye did not spare_;[232] but as the hail\r\nscatters the _untimely figs_ from _the fig-trees_,[233] and as _the wind\r\nthe dust from the face of the earth_,[234] so did he strive with all his\r\nmight to drive out before his face and destroy entirely such things from\r\nhis people. And in place of all these the most excellent legislator\r\ndelivered the heavenly laws. He made regulations full of righteousness,\r\nfull of moderation and integrity. Moreover in all churches he ordained\r\nthe apostolic sanctions and the decrees of the holy fathers, and\r\nespecially the customs of the holy Roman Church.[235] Hence it is that\r\nto this day there is chanting and psalmody in them at the canonical\r\nhours after the fashion of the whole world. For there was no such thing\r\nbefore, not even in the city.[236] He, however, had learnt singing in\r\nhis youth, and soon he introduced song into his monastery,[237] while as\r\nyet none in the city, nor in the whole bishopric, could or would sing.\r\nThen Malachy instituted anew[238] the most wholesome usage of\r\nConfession,[239] the Sacrament of Confirmation, the Marriage\r\ncontract--of all of which they were either ignorant or negligent.[240]\r\nAnd let these serve as an example of the rest, for [here] and through\r\nthe whole course of the history we omit much for the sake of brevity.\r\n\r\n8. (5). Since he had a desire and a very great zeal for the honouring of\r\nthe divine offices and the veneration of the sacraments, lest by chance\r\nhe might ordain or teach anything concerning these matters otherwise\r\nthan that which was in accordance with the rite of the universal Church,\r\nit came into his mind to visit Bishop Malchus,[241] that he might give\r\nhim fuller information on all points. He was _an old man, full of\r\ndays_[242] and virtues, and _the wisdom of God was in him_.[243] He was\r\nof Irish nationality, but had lived in England in the habit and rule of\r\na monk in the monastery of Winchester, from which he was promoted to be\r\nbishop in Lismore,[244] a city of Munster, and one of the noblest of the\r\ncities of that kingdom. There so great grace was bestowed upon him from\r\nabove that he was illustrious, not only for life and doctrine, but also\r\nfor signs. Of these I set down two as examples, that it may be known to\r\nall what sort of preceptor Malachy had in the knowledge of holy things.\r\nHe healed a boy, who was troubled with a mental disorder, one of those\r\nwho are called lunatics, in the act of confirming him with the holy\r\nunction. This was so well known and certain that he soon made him porter\r\nof his house, and the boy lived in good health in that office till he\r\nreached manhood. He restored hearing to one who was deaf; in which\r\nmiracle the deaf person acknowledged a wonderful fact, that when the\r\nsaint put his fingers into his ears on either side he perceived that\r\ntwo things like little pigs came out of them. For these and other such\r\ndeeds, his fame increased and he won a great name; so that Scots[245]\r\nand Irish flowed together to him and he was reverenced by all as the one\r\nfather of all.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1121]\r\n\r\nWhen therefore Malachy, having received the blessing of Father Imar, and\r\nhaving been sent by the bishop,[246] came to him, after a prosperous\r\njourney, he was kindly received by the old man; and he remained with him\r\nfor some years,[247] in order that by staying so long he might draw\r\nfuller draughts from his aged breast, knowing that which is written,\r\n_With the ancient is wisdom._[248] But I suppose that another cause of\r\nhis long sojourn was that the great Foreseer of all things would have\r\nHis servant Malachy become known to all in a place to which so many\r\nresorted, since he was to be useful to all. For he could not but be dear\r\nto those who knew him. In fact one thing happened in that period, by\r\nwhich in some measure he made manifest to men what had been known to\r\nGod as being in him.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1127]\r\n\r\n9. A conflict having taken place between the king of South\r\nMunster[249]--which is the southern part of Ireland--and his\r\nbrother,[250] and the brother being victorious, the king, driven from\r\nhis kingdom, sought refuge with Bishop Malchus.[251] It was not,\r\nhowever, in order that with his help he should recover the kingdom; but\r\nrather the devout prince _gave place unto wrath_[252] and made a virtue\r\nof necessity,[253] choosing to lead a private life. And when the bishop\r\nwas preparing to receive the king with due honour, he declined it,\r\nsaying that he preferred to be as one of those poor brothers who\r\nconsorted with him, to lay aside his royal state, and to be content with\r\nthe common poverty, rather to await the will of God than to get back his\r\nkingdom by force; and that he would not for his earthly honour _shed\r\nman's blood_,[254] since it would _cry unto_ God against him _from the\r\nground_.[255] When he heard this the bishop rejoiced greatly, and with\r\nadmiration for his devotion satisfied his desire. Why more? The king is\r\ngiven a poor house for his dwelling, Malachy for his teacher, bread with\r\nsalt and water for his food. Moreover for dainties, the presence of\r\nMalachy, his life and doctrine, were sufficient for the king; so that he\r\nmight say to him, _How sweet are thy words unto my taste, yea, sweeter\r\nthan honey to my mouth._[256] Besides, _every night he watered his couch\r\nwith his tears_,[257] and also with a daily bath of cold water he\r\nquenched the burning lust for evil in his flesh. And the king prayed in\r\nthe words of another king, _Look upon my affliction and my pain; and\r\nforgive all my sins._[258] And _God did not turn away his prayer nor His\r\nmercy from him_.[259] _And his supplication was heard_,[260] although\r\notherwise than he had desired. For he was troubled about his soul; but\r\nGod, the avenger of innocence, willing to show men _that there is a\r\nremainder for the man of peace_,[261] was preparing meanwhile _to\r\nexecute a judgement for the oppressed_,[262] which was utterly beyond\r\nhis hope. And God _stirred up the spirit_ of a neighbouring _king_:[263]\r\nfor Ireland is not one kingdom, but is divided into many. This king\r\ntherefore seeing what had been done, was filled with wrath; and\r\nindignant, on the one hand, at the freedom of the raiders and the\r\ninsolence of the proud, and on the other, pitying the desolation of the\r\nkingdom and the downfall of the king, he went down to the cell of the\r\npoor man; urged him to return, but did not succeed in persuading him. He\r\nwas instant, nevertheless, pledged himself to help him, assured him that\r\nhe need not doubt the result, promised that God would be with him, _whom\r\nall his adversaries would not be able to resist_.[264] He laid before\r\nhim also the oppression of the poor and the devastation of his country;\r\nyet he prevailed not.\r\n\r\n10. But when to these arguments were added the command of the\r\nbishop[265] and the advice of Malachy--the two men on whom he wholly\r\ndepended--at length, with difficulty, he consented. A king followed a\r\nking, and according to the word of the king,[266] _as was the will in\r\nheaven_,[267] the marauders were driven out with absolute ease, and the\r\nman was led back to his own, with great rejoicing of his people, and was\r\nrestored to his kingdom. From that time the king loved and always\r\nreverenced Malachy; so much the more because he had learned more fully\r\nin the holy man the things that were worthy of reverence and affection.\r\nFor he could not be ignorant of the holiness of him with whom he had\r\nenjoyed so much intimacy in his adversity. Therefore he honoured him the\r\nmore in his prosperity with constant acts of friendship, and faithful\r\nservices, _and he heard him gladly, and when he heard him did many\r\nthings_.[268] But enough of this. Nevertheless I suppose it was not\r\nwithout purpose that the Lord so magnified him then _before kings_,[269]\r\nbut _he was a chosen vessel unto Him_, about _to bear His name before\r\nkings_ and princes.[270]\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[134] Malachy was born in 1095, before November. See below, p. 130. n.\r\n2.\r\n\r\n[135] _Urbanum_, citizen-like.\r\n\r\n[136] Eph. ii. 19.\r\n\r\n[137] Deut. xxxii. 13.\r\n\r\n[138] _A.T._ make the curious statement that \"Mael Maedoc o Mongair\r\nand his father Mughron\" died in 1102. This is perhaps sufficient\r\nevidence that Malachy's father was Mughron Ua Morgair, who according\r\nto _A.U._ was _ard fer légind_ (chief professor) at Armagh, and died\r\nat Mungret, Co. Limerick, on October 5, 1102. Malachy was then only\r\nseven or eight years of age. Thus we may account for the large part\r\ntaken by his mother in his early education. But a poem attributed to\r\nMalachy (_L.B._ 88) calls his father Dermot. The form of the surname\r\nvaries. It is usually written Ua Morgair; but _A.T._, _A.I._ (Ua\r\nMongain), _L.B._ (_l.c._), and the Yellow Book of Lecan (T.C.D. MS. H.\r\n2. 16, p. 327 c), have Ua Mongair. The form Ua Morgair is certainly\r\nright, for it appears in the contemporary Book of Leinster (_R.I.A._\r\nxxxv. 355-360); and Ua Mongair obviously arose out of it through\r\nconfusion of the similar letters _r_ and _n_. The name must have been\r\nunfamiliar, if it had not died out, when the mistake was made.\r\nTherefore we may accept Colgan's statement that the family was known\r\nas O'Dogherty in his day (_Trias_, p. 299). If so, they had probably\r\nonly resumed an earlier surname: for according to MacFirbis (Royal\r\nIrish Academy MS. 23 P. 1, p. 698) Malachy was of the same stock as\r\nSt. Mael Brigte, son of Tornan. The latter, as well as the\r\nO'Doghertys, were of the race of Conall Gulban (Adamnan, Genealogy\r\nopp. p. 342).\r\n\r\n[139] 2 Sam. vii. 9.\r\n\r\n[140] It is interesting to note the emphasis laid by St. Bernard on\r\nthe influence of Malachy's mother on his life. How much he himself\r\nowed to his mother Aleth is well known. See _V.P._ i. 1, 2, 9, 10.\r\nMalachy's mother was probably a member of the family of O'Hanratty.\r\nSee below, p. 27, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[141] Prov. viii. 22.\r\n\r\n[142] Ps. xvi. 11.\r\n\r\n[143] Ps. xxxiv. 11.\r\n\r\n[144] The description of Malachy's boyhood by St. Bernard may be\r\ncompared with that given of his own boyhood in _V.P._ i. 3.

He was no doubt Imar O'Hagan, who\r\nfounded the monastery of St. Paul and St. Peter at Armagh, and built a\r\nstone church for it which was consecrated on October 21, 1126. It was\r\nplaced, either at its foundation or subsequently, under the rule of\r\nthe regular canons of St. Augustine. Imar died on pilgrimage at Rome\r\nin 1134, and is commemorated in Gorman on August 13, and in Usuard on\r\nNovember 12. He was at this time evidently leading the life of an\r\nanchoret. Reeves (_Churches_, p. 28) inferred from his Christian name\r\nthat he had some Danish blood in his veins. There is no certain\r\nindication of Malachy's age when he became his disciple. But he had\r\nreached adolescence (§ 3), and was old enough to choose his own\r\nteachers (§ 2). In 1112 he was seventeen years of age. We shall see\r\nthat he long acknowledged Imar as his master: §§ 5, 6, 8, 12, 14, 16.\r\n\r\n[180] 1 Cor. ix. 27 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[181] That is, apparently, the great stone church (_daimliac mór_), on\r\nwhich Cellach put a shingle roof in 1125. According to Reeves\r\n(_Churches_, pp. 14, 28) it was probably on the site of the present\r\nCathedral, from which the Abbey of St. Paul and St. Peter was distant\r\n130 yards to the north. It was the principal church of Armagh till\r\n1268. For an account of the life of such recluses as Imar the reader\r\nmay be referred to B. MacCarthy, _Codex Palatino-Vaticanus No. 830_,\r\np. 5 f.\r\n\r\n[182] Luke ii. 37.\r\n\r\n[183] _Formam._ The word, as used by St. Bernard, seems to include the\r\ntwo notions of rule and example. It would seem that Malachy received\r\nsome sort of monastic rule from Imar. Cp. § 7, \"his monastery,\" and\r\nthe reference to \"the first day of his conversion\" in § 43. Both\r\npassages imply that he belonged to a religious order. So in § 5 he is\r\nsaid to have been before the other disciples of Imar \"in conversion.\"\r\nOn later occasions he was subject to Imar's \"command\" (§§ 14, 16). It\r\nis not improbable that the disciples who gathered round Imar were the\r\nnucleus of the community which he founded at Armagh (note 1). If so,\r\nthe inference is reasonable that Malachy became a regular canon of St.\r\nAugustine.\r\n\r\n[184] Matt. xi. 29.\r\n\r\n[185] Cp. 2 Tim. iv. 3.\r\n\r\n[186] Matt. xv. 14.\r\n\r\n[187] Isa. liv. 13; John vi. 45.\r\n\r\n[188] 1 Cor. iv. 3.\r\n\r\n[189] Gal. i. 11, 12.\r\n\r\n[190] Gal. ii. 2.\r\n\r\n[191] Printed text, _hoc scit_.

This explains the stress laid by St. Bernard, here and\r\nelsewhere, on Malachy's practice. Cp. the Preface of Philip of\r\nClairvaux to _V.P._ vi.: \"In truth I have learned nothing that can\r\nmore effectively deserve the riches of the grace of the Lord than to\r\nsit and be silent, and always to condescend to men of low estate.\"\r\n\r\n[196] Isa. xxxii. 17 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[197] Ps. cxix. 141 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[198] Lam. iii. 28.\r\n\r\n[199] John i. 14, 18.\r\n\r\n[200] Rom. viii. 29.\r\n\r\n[201] The technical word for entry into a religious order.\r\n\r\n[202] Cellach, archbishop of Armagh (§ 19), son of Aedh, and grandson\r\nof Maelisa, who was abbot of Armagh 1064-1091. He was born early in\r\n1080. Of his childhood and youth we know nothing, for the statement of\r\nMeredith Hanmer (_Chron. of Ireland_ (1633), p. 101) that he is said\r\nto have been \"brought up at Oxford\" is probably as inaccurate as other\r\nassertions which he makes about him. Cellach was elected abbot of\r\nArmagh in August, 1105, and in the following month (September 23) he\r\nreceived Holy Orders. In 1106, while engaged on a visitation of\r\nMunster, he was consecrated bishop. Thus he departed from the\r\nprecedent set by his eight predecessors, who were without orders (§\r\n19). He was one of the leaders of the Romanizing party in Ireland, and\r\nattended the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1110 (Keating, iii. 307). He\r\ndied in his fiftieth year, at Ardpatrick, in co. Limerick, on April 1,\r\n1129, and was buried on April 4 at Lismore. These facts are mainly\r\ngathered from the Annals. For more about Cellach, see p. xxxiv.\r\n\r\n[203] Imar. See above p. 11, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[204] Luke xxiv. 29.--Malachy can hardly have been more, he was\r\nprobably less, than twenty-three years of age at this time. See p. 16,\r\nn. 2.\r\n\r\n[205] _I.e._ deacon.\r\n\r\n[206] It does not appear that deacons as such were specially concerned\r\nwith the burial of the dead. The present passage, indeed, implies the\r\ncontrary. Malachy was made deacon against his will; his care for the\r\ndead poor is mentioned as a work of piety, voluntarily superadded to\r\nthe duties of his office. His sister (see below) would have been\r\nunlikely to ask him to abandon a practice which he could not decline.\r\nBut there was ancient precedent for a deacon engaging in such work, of\r\nwhich Malachy may have been aware. At Alexandria throughout the\r\npersecution of Valerian, one of the deacons, Eusebius by name, not\r\nwithout danger to himself, prepared for burial the bodies of \"the\r\nperfect and blessed martyrs\" (Eus., _H.E._ vii. 11. 24).\r\n\r\n[207] _Tobiae._ The Greek of the Book of Tobit, followed by the\r\nEnglish versions, calls the father Tobit, and the son Tobias; the\r\nVulgate calls both Tobias. The text of chap. ii. is longer in the\r\nVulgate than in the Greek and English, and neither of the verses\r\n(Vulg. 12, 23) from which St. Bernard here borrows words is\r\nrepresented in the latter.\r\n\r\n[208] Tobit ii. 12 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[209] Cp. Gen. iii. 12 f.\r\n\r\n[210] She is mentioned again in § 11.\r\n\r\n[211] Matt. viii. 22.\r\n\r\n[212] Tobit ii. 23 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[213] Prov. xxvi. 5.\r\n\r\n[214] Ps. xii. 6.\r\n\r\n[215] Cellach and Imar.\r\n\r\n[216] Malachy completed his twenty-fifth year in 1120. See p. 130, n.\r\n2. For the date of his ordination to the priesthood see p. 16, n. 2.\r\n\r\n[217] For the canons of councils which regulated the minimum age of\r\ndeacons and priests reference may be made to the article \"Orders,\r\nHoly,\" by the late Dr. Edwin Hatch in the _Dictionary of Christian\r\nAntiquities_, vol. ii. p. 1482 f. From a very early date they were\r\nrespectively twenty-five and thirty years, in accordance with the\r\nstatement of the text, though there were some exceptions in remote\r\nplaces. The eighth-century Irish Canons, known as the _Hibernensis_,\r\nprescribe the same minimum ages for the diaconate and presbyterate,\r\nand add a clause, the gist of which seems to be that a bishop at the\r\ntime of his consecration must be thirty or forty years of age\r\n(Wasserschleben, _Irische Kanonesammlung_, 1885, p. 8). As late as the\r\nyear 1089, at the Council of Melfi, presided over by Pope Urban II.,\r\nit was decreed (can. 5, Mansi, xx. 723) that none should be admitted\r\ndeacon under twenty-four or twenty-five years of age, or priest under\r\nthirty. But at the Council of Ravenna, 1315 (can. 2, _ibid._ xxv.\r\n537), the ages were lowered to twenty and twenty-five respectively.\r\n\r\n[218] Cellach would hardly have understood the need for this apology.\r\nIt is more than probable that he was ignorant of the canons referred\r\nto. He himself was ordained, apparently to the priesthood, in 1105,\r\nwhen he was under twenty-six, and consecrated bishop in 1106, when he\r\nwas under twenty-seven years of age. St. Bernard himself seems to have\r\nbeen ordained priest when he was about twenty-five years old\r\n(Vacandard, i. 67).\r\n\r\n[219] In other words he made him his vicar. This may well have been in\r\n1120; for the Annals record that in that year Cellach made a\r\nvisitation of Munster. It was quite natural that during a prolonged\r\nabsence from his see he should leave its administration in the hands\r\nof one who had proved himself so capable as Malachy. And we shall see\r\nthat this date harmonizes with other chronological data. If, then, we\r\nplace the beginning of Malachy's vicariate in 1120, his ordination as\r\npriest, which appears to have been not much earlier, may be dated in\r\n1119, when he was \"about twenty-five years of age,\" _i.e._ probably\r\nsoon after his twenty-fourth birthday. His admission to the diaconate\r\nmay be placed at least a year earlier, _i.e._ in 1118. Indeed, if we\r\ncould be sure that in Ireland the normal interval between admission to\r\nthe diaconate and to the priesthood was at all as long as in other\r\ncountries we might put it further back.\r\n\r\n[220] Luke viii. 5.\r\n\r\n[221] 1 Pet. ii. 9.\r\n\r\n[222] Rom. ii. 12.\r\n\r\n[223] Rom. xii. 11.\r\n\r\n[224] Cp.

Rev. vi. 13.\r\n\r\n[234] Ps. i. 4 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[235] Malachy acted in accordance with the aims of Gilbert, bishop of\r\nLimerick, who about the year 1108, wrote these words (_De Usu\r\nEcclesiastico_, in Ussher, 500): \"I have endeavoured to describe the\r\ncanonical custom in saying the hours and performing the office of the\r\nwhole ecclesiastical order ... to the end that the various and\r\nschismatical orders, with which almost the whole of Ireland has been\r\ndeluded, may give place to the one Catholic and Roman office.\"\r\n\r\n[236] Armagh.\r\n\r\n[237] This was probably the monastery of SS. Peter and Paul. See p.\r\n11, n. 5. J. de Backer's suggestion (_AA.SS._, Nov. ii. 1, p. 147),\r\nthat \"his monastery\" was Bangor is negatived by the whole context,\r\nwhich refers only to Armagh.\r\n\r\n[238] The word \"anew\" (_de nouo_) seems to indicate St. Bernard's\r\nbelief that it was only in comparatively recent times that the usages\r\nto which he refers had fallen into desuetude.\r\n\r\n[239] It is interesting to observe that Confession is here not ranked\r\nas a sacrament.\r\n\r\n[240] For the statements in this section see Additional Note A.\r\n\r\n[241] Mael Isa Ua hAinmire, who is always called Malchus in Latin\r\ndocuments, though a native of Ireland, had been a monk of Winchester,\r\nas we are here told. He was elected first bishop of the Danish colony\r\nof Waterford in 1096, and was consecrated by Anselm, assisted by the\r\nbishops of Chichester and Rochester, at Canterbury on December 28,\r\nhaving previously made his profession of obedience to the archbishop\r\nas one of his suffragans (Eadmer, p. 76 f.; Ussher, pp. 518, 565). He\r\nsigned the Acts of the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1110 as archbishop of\r\nCashel (Keating, iii. 307). He had probably been translated to that\r\nsee shortly after its foundation in 1106 (see below, p. 65, n. 4). The\r\nSynod of Rathbreasail enlarged the Danish diocese of Waterford by\r\nadding to it an extensive non-Danish area, which included the ancient\r\nreligious site of Lismore, on which St. Carthach or Mochuta had\r\nfounded a community in the early part of the seventh century (Lanigan,\r\nii. 353). The Synod decreed that the see of this diocese should be\r\neither at Lismore or at Waterford, apparently giving preference to the\r\nformer (see p. xlvii). It would seem that after organizing the diocese\r\nof Cashel Malchus retired to his former \"parish,\" just as at a later\r\ndate Malachy retired from Armagh to Down (§ 31), placing his see at\r\nLismore. There, at any rate, he was established when Malachy visited\r\nhim, and there he died in 1135 \"after the 88th year of his pilgrimage\"\r\n(_A.F.M._). An attempt has been made to distinguish Mael Isa Ua\r\nhAinmire from the Malchus of the text (Lanigan, iv. 74), but without\r\nsuccess. It is interesting to observe that both _A.F.M._ and _A.T._\r\nstyle him bishop of Waterford in the record of his death.\r\n\r\n[242] Gen. xxxv. 29; 1 Chron. xxiii. 1; Job xlii. 16.--Malchus was in\r\nhis 75th year when Malachy visited him in 1121. See preceding note,\r\nand p. 20, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[243] 1 Kings iii. 28.\r\n\r\n[244] An error for Waterford. It is explained by, and confirms, the\r\nsuggestion that Malchus transferred the see to Lismore.\r\n\r\n[245] Throughout the _Life_, _Scotia_ is used, in its later sense, for\r\nthe country now called Scotland; and here the Scots are evidently its\r\ninhabitants. But traces of earlier usage remain in § 14, \"a Scotic\r\n(_i.e._ Irish) work,\" § 61 \"We are Scots,\" and § 72 where Ireland is\r\ncalled \"further Scotland\" (_ulterior Scotia_).\r\n\r\n[246] Cellach. Note Imar's share in the matter, and cp. p. 11, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[247] Malachy must have been the archbishop's vicar for a considerable\r\ntime if the account of his labours in that capacity (§ 7) is not\r\ngrossly exaggerated. Hence, if his vicariate began in 1119 or 1120 his\r\ndeparture for Lismore can hardly have been earlier than 1121; and as\r\nhe spent \"some years\" there before he was raised to the episcopate\r\n(1124; see § 16), it cannot have been later. Samuel O'Hanley, bishop\r\nof Dublin, died on July 4, 1121, and Cellach at once made an attempt,\r\nwhich proved unsuccessful, to take possession of the vacant see.\r\nSamuel's successor, Gregory, was duly elected, and was consecrated at\r\nLambeth on October 2. (_O.C.C._ p. 31; _A.U._ 1121; John of Worcester,\r\ned. J. H. R. Weaver, 1908, p. 16; Ussher, 532). It may have been in\r\nAugust or September, on the return of Cellach from Dublin, that\r\nMalachy was released from his office and went to Lismore.\r\n\r\n[248] Job xii. 12.\r\n\r\n[249] I read _rex australis Mumoniae_, for _rex Mumoniae_ in the\r\nprinted text, restoring the word _australis_ from two of de Backer's\r\nMSS. The king is said in § 18 to have been Cormac, _i.e._ Cormac Mac\r\nCarthy, son of Teague Mac Carthy, who succeeded his father as king of\r\nDesmond (South Munster) in 1124. He was never king of the whole of\r\nMunster. That he went to Lismore in 1121 is very probable. For the\r\nAnnals tell us that in that year Turlough O'Conor, king of Connaught,\r\ninvaded Desmond, and \"arrived at the termon of Lismore\" (_A.I._ say\r\nthat he destroyed Lismore, which can hardly be true). What more likely\r\nthan that one of the sons of Teague, the reigning monarch of Desmond,\r\nshould fly before that formidable warrior to the sanctuary of Mochuta?\r\nBut St. Bernard errs in supposing that he was then king of Desmond. On\r\nCormac, see also p. 43, n. 5.\r\n\r\n[250] Donough Mac Carthy. See next note. There is a brief notice of\r\nhim in Tundale, p. 42.\r\n\r\n[251] That the narrative of this and the following section is\r\nhistorical, but that St. Bernard has misplaced it, is proved by the\r\nfollowing extract from _A.T._ under the year 1127: \"A hosting by\r\nToirdelbach, king of Ireland [really of Connaught], till he reached\r\nCorcach, he himself on land and his fleet at sea going round to\r\nCorcach, ravaging Munster by sea and by land so that he drove Cormac\r\nmac meic Carthaig into Lismore in pilgrimage. And Toirdelbach divided\r\nMunster into two parts, the southern half [Desmond] to Donnchad mac\r\nmeic Carthaig; and the northern half [Thomond] to Conchobar o\r\nBriain.... Cormac mac meic Carthaig came from his pilgrimage, and made\r\nan alliance with Conchobar o Briain and with all the men of Muma, save\r\nthose of Tuathmuma. Donnchad mac meic Carthaig came from them--for he\r\nwas not in the alliance--with 2000 men.\"\r\n\r\nThe other Annals have notices to the same effect. These events\r\noccurred in 1127, three years after Malachy returned from his long\r\nstay at Lismore, and was made bishop of Connor (§ 16). If he had the\r\npart which is ascribed to him in the restoration of Cormac, he must\r\ntherefore have paid two visits to Lismore, which St. Bernard has\r\nconfounded. That he was in the south of Ireland for a considerable\r\ntime prior to 1129 will appear later (p. 40, n. 2).\r\n\r\n[252] Rom. xii. 19.\r\n\r\n[253] _Necessitatem in uirtutem conuertit._ Apparently a proverbial\r\nexpression.

He restores the Monastery of\r\nBangor. His first Miracles._\r\n\r\n\r\n11. (6). Meanwhile Malachy's sister, whom we mentioned before,[271]\r\ndied: and we must not pass over the visions which he saw about her. For\r\nthe saint indeed abhorred her carnal life, and with such intensity that\r\nhe vowed he would never see her alive in the flesh. But now that her\r\nflesh was destroyed his vow was also destroyed, and he began to see in\r\nspirit her whom in the body he would not see. One night he heard in a\r\ndream the voice of one saying to him that his sister was standing\r\noutside in the court, and that for thirty entire days she had tasted\r\nnothing; and when he awoke he soon understood the sort of food for want\r\nof which she was pining away. And when he had diligently considered the\r\nnumber of days which he had heard, he discovered that it went back to\r\nthe time when he had ceased to offer the _living bread from heaven_[272]\r\nfor her. Then, since he hated not the soul of his sister but her sin, he\r\nbegan again the good practice which he had abandoned. And not in vain.\r\nNot long after she was seen by him to have come to the threshold of the\r\nchurch, but to be not yet able to enter; she appeared also in dark\r\nraiment. And when he persevered, taking care that on no single day she\r\nshould be disappointed of the accustomed gift, he saw her a second time\r\nin whitish raiment, admitted indeed within the church, but not allowed\r\nto approach the altar. At last she was seen, a third time, gathered in\r\nthe company of the white-robed, and _in bright clothing_.[273] You see,\r\nreader, how much _the effectual fervent prayer of a righteous man\r\navaileth_.[274] Truly _the kingdom of heaven suffereth violence and the\r\nviolent take it by force_.[275] Does not the prayer of Malachy seem to\r\nyou to have played the part as it were of a housebreaker to the heavenly\r\ngates, when a sinful woman obtained by the weapons of a brother what was\r\ndenied to her own merits? This _violence_, good Jesus, Thou who\r\n_sufferest_ dost exercise, strong and merciful _to save_,[276] _showing_\r\nmercy and _strength with thine arm_,[277] and preserving it in thy\r\nsacrament for _the saints which are in the earth_,[278] _unto the end of\r\nthe world_.[279] Truly this sacrament is strong to _consume_ sins,[280]\r\nto defeat opposing powers, to bring into heaven those who are returning\r\nfrom the earth.\r\n\r\n12. (7). The Lord, indeed, was so preparing His beloved Malachy in the\r\ndistrict of Lismore for the glory of His name. But those who had sent\r\nhim,[281] tolerating his absence no longer, recalled him by letters.\r\nWhen he was restored to his people,[282] now better instructed in all\r\nthat was necessary, behold _a work prepared_ and kept by _God_[283] for\r\nMalachy. A rich and powerful man, who held the place of Bangor and its\r\npossessions, by inspiration of God immediately placed in his hand all\r\nthat he had and himself as well.[284] And he was his mother's\r\nbrother.[285] But kinship of spirit was of more value to Malachy than\r\nkinship of the flesh. The actual place also of Bangor, from which he\r\nreceived his name,[286] the prince[287] made over to him, that there he\r\nmight build, or rather rebuild, a monastery. For indeed there had been\r\nformerly a very celebrated one under the first father, Comgall,[288]\r\nwhich produced many thousands of monks, and was the head of many\r\nmonasteries. A truly holy place it was and prolific of saints, _bringing\r\nforth_ most abundant _fruit to God_,[289] so that one of the sons of\r\nthat holy community, Lugaid[290] by name, is said to have been the\r\nfounder--himself alone--of a hundred monasteries. I mention this in\r\norder that the reader may infer from this one instance what an immense\r\nnumber of others there were. In fine, to such an extent did its shoots\r\nfill Ireland and Scotland[291] that those verses of David seem to have\r\nsung beforehand especially of these times, _Thou visitest the earth and\r\nblessest it; thou makest it very plenteous. The river of God is full of\r\nwater: thou preparest their corn, for so thou providest for the earth,\r\nblessing its rivers, multiplying its shoots. With its drops of rain\r\nshall it rejoice while it germinates_;[292] and in like manner the\r\nverses that follow. Nor was it only into the regions just mentioned, but\r\nalso into foreign lands that those swarms of saints poured forth as\r\nthough a _flood had risen_;[293] of whom one, St. Columbanus, came up to\r\nour Gallican parts, and built the monastery of Luxovium, and was _made\r\nthere a great people_.[294] So great a people was it, they say, that\r\nthe choirs succeeding one another in turn, the solemnities of the divine\r\noffices went on continuously, so that not a moment day or night was\r\nempty of praises.[295]\r\n\r\n13. (8) Enough has been said about the ancient glory of the monastery of\r\nBangor. This, long ago destroyed by pirates,[296] Malachy eagerly\r\ncherished on account of its remarkable and long-standing prestige, as\r\nthough he were about to _replant a paradise_,[297] and because _many\r\nbodies of the saints slept_ there.[298] For, not to speak of those which\r\nwere _buried in peace_,[299] it is said that nine hundred persons were\r\nslain together in one day by pirates.[300] Vast, indeed, were the\r\npossessions of that place;[301] but Malachy, content with the holy place\r\nalone, resigned all the possessions and lands to another. For indeed\r\nfrom the time when the monastery was destroyed there was always someone\r\nto hold it with its possessions. For they were both appointed by\r\nelection and were even called abbots, preserving in name but not in fact\r\nwhat had once been.[302] And though many urged him not to alienate the\r\npossessions, but to retain the whole together for himself, this lover of\r\npoverty did not consent, but caused one to be elected, according to\r\ncustom, to hold them; the place, as we have said, being retained for\r\nMalachy and his followers. And perhaps, as afterwards appeared,[303] he\r\nwould have been wiser to have kept it all; only he looked more to\r\nhumility than to peace.\r\n\r\n14. So, then, by the command of Father Imar, taking with him about ten\r\nbrethren, he came to the place and began to build. And there, one day,\r\nwhen he himself was cutting with an axe, by chance one of the workmen,\r\nwhile he was brandishing the axe in the air, carelessly got into the\r\nplace at which the blow was aimed, and it fell on his spine with as much\r\nforce as Malachy could strike. He fell, and all ran to him supposing\r\nthat he had received a death-wound or was dead. And indeed his tunic was\r\n_rent from the top to the bottom_,[304] but the man himself was found\r\nunhurt, the skin so very slightly grazed that scarcely a trace appeared\r\non the surface. The man whom the axe had laid low, stood unharmed while\r\nthe bystanders beheld him with amazement. Hence they became more eager,\r\nand were found readier for the work. And _this was the beginning of the\r\nmiracles_[305] of Malachy. Moreover the oratory was finished in a few\r\ndays, made of smoothed planks indeed, but closely and strongly fastened\r\ntogether--a Scotic work,[306] not devoid of beauty.[307] And\r\nthenceforward God was served in it as in the ancient days; that is,\r\nwith similar devotion, though not with like numbers. Malachy presided\r\nover that place for some time,[308] by the ordinance of Father\r\nImar,[309] being at once the ruler and the rule of the brethren. They\r\nread in his life how they should behave themselves, and he was their\r\nleader _in righteousness and holiness before God_;[310] save that\r\nbesides the things appointed for the whole community he did many things\r\nof an exceptional kind, in which he still more was the leader of all,\r\nand none of the others was able to follow him to such difficult\r\npractices.\r\n\r\nAt that time and place a certain man was sick, and the devil stood by\r\nhim and suggested in plain speech that he should never heed the\r\nadmonitions of Malachy, but if he should enter his house, he should\r\nattack and kill him with a knife. And when this became known, those who\r\nministered to him, the sick man himself informing them, brought word to\r\nMalachy and warned him. But he, seizing his accustomed weapons of\r\nprayer, boldly attacked his enemy, and put to flight both disease and\r\ndemon. _But the_ man's _name was Malchus_.[311] He is brother according\r\nto the flesh of our Christian, abbot of Mellifont.[312] For both are\r\nstill alive, now brothers yet more, in spirit.[313] For when he was\r\ndelivered, immediately he was not ungrateful, but in the same place,\r\nhaving _turned[314] to the Lord_,[315] he changed both his habit and his\r\nmind. And the brethren knew that the evil one was envious of their\r\nprosperity; and they were edified and made more careful henceforth.\r\n\r\n15. (9). At the same place he healed a cleric, named Michael, who was\r\nsuffering from dysentery and despaired of, by sending him something from\r\nhis table. A second time, when the same person was smitten with a very\r\ngrave disorder, he cured him both in body and mind. And from that moment\r\n_he clave to_ God[316] and to Malachy His servant, fearing _lest a worse\r\nthing should come unto him_,[317] if once more he should be found\r\nungrateful for so great a benefit and miracle. And at present, as we\r\nhave heard, he presides over a monastery in the parts of Scotland; and\r\nthis was the latest of all Malachy's foundations.[318] Through such\r\ndeeds of Malachy both his reputation and his community increased daily,\r\nand his name became great both within and without the monastery, though\r\nnot greater than the fact. For indeed he dwelt[319] there even after he\r\nwas made bishop, for the place was near the city.[320]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[271] See § 6. Malachy's sister is here said to have died while he was\r\nat Lismore; but whether during his earlier or later visit to that\r\nplace cannot be determined.\r\n\r\n[272] John vi. 51.\r\n\r\n[273] Acts x. 30.\r\n\r\n[274] Jas. v. 16.\r\n\r\n[275] Matt. xi. 12.\r\n\r\n[276] Cp. Isa. lxiii. 1.\r\n\r\n[277] Luke i. 51.\r\n\r\n[278] Ps. xvi. 3.\r\n\r\n[279] Matt. xxviii. 20.\r\n\r\n[280] Ps vii. 9 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[281] Cellach and Imar (§ 8).\r\n\r\n[282] That is to Armagh. But see p. 36, n. 5.\r\n\r\n[283] Eph. ii. 10 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[284] This person was apparently the coarb of Comgall, the founder of\r\nBangor. It would seem that he had been but a short time in office, for\r\nOengus O'Gorman, coarb of Comgall, died at Lismore in 1123 (_A.U._),\r\nprobably during Malachy's sojourn there. It is not impossible that the\r\nunnamed coarb, mentioned in the text, was Murtough O'Hanratty, who\r\ndied at Armagh in 1131 (_A.F.M._). The statement that he gave\r\n\"himself\" to Malachy seems to mean that he placed himself under his\r\nrule in the new community.\r\n\r\n[285] If the identification suggested in the preceding note is\r\ncorrect, Malachy's mother belonged to the family of O'Hanratty, which\r\nin the eleventh and twelfth centuries held the chieftaincy of Ui Méith\r\nMacha or Ui Méith Tíre, now the barony of Monaghan, in the county of\r\nthe same name.\r\n\r\n[286] _Cognominabatur._ This verb occurs seventeen times in the\r\nVulgate, and almost always indicates a new or alternative name. In the\r\npresent passage it certainly applies, not to Malachy's baptismal name,\r\nbut to its Latin equivalent, Malachias, which he probably assumed when\r\nhe became abbot of Bangor, or bishop of Down. The remark that he\r\nreceived it from Bangor is to be explained thus. A legend, which has a\r\nplace in Jocelin's _Life of St. Patrick_ (§ 98) and is therefore at\r\nleast as old as the twelfth century, relates that Patrick, viewing the\r\nvalley in which the monastery of Comgall was afterwards constructed,\r\nperceived that it was \"filled with a multitude of the heavenly host.\"\r\nFrom this story, no doubt, came the name \"Valley of Angels (_Vallis\r\nAngelorum_),\" by which it was known in the early seventeenth century,\r\nand probably long before (Reeves, p. 199). If this name, or the legend\r\non which it was based, was known to Malachy it is quite conceivable\r\nthat on account of his connexion with Bangor, he adopted, as the Latin\r\nalternative of Máel Máedóc, a name which is only the Hebrew for _my\r\nangel_ with a Latin termination. That St. Bernard was aware of the\r\nsignificance of the name, and liked to dwell upon it, is clear from\r\nSermon ii. § 5. It may be added that the legend just mentioned is\r\nconnected with a folk-etymology of the word Bangor (_Bennchor_) which\r\nexplained it as \"white choir.\" For the true etymology see Kuno Meyer,\r\n\"Zur Keltischen Wortkunde,\" § 66 (_Preuss. Akad. Sitz._, 1913).\r\n\r\n[287] _Princeps._ This word does not necessarily imply that the donor\r\nof Bangor was a secular chieftain. St. Bernard is somewhat arbitrary\r\nin his use of such titles; and _princeps_ occurs very frequently in\r\n_A.U._ up to the tenth century as an equivalent of _abbot_.\r\n\r\n[288] Comgall, who was a Pict of Dál Araide (Adamnan, i. 49), was born\r\nat Magheramorne, near Larne, co. Antrim (Reeves, p. 269), between 516\r\nand 520. He founded the monastery of Bangor when he was about forty\r\nyears old, probably in 559, and presided over it till his death in 602\r\n(_A.U._). According to his Latin Life (§ 13, Plummer, ii. 7), so great\r\na number of monks came to him there that there was not room for them;\r\n\"he therefore founded very many cells and many monasteries, not only\r\nin the district of Ulaid, but throughout the other provinces of\r\nIreland.\" There were as many as 3000 monks under his rule. On the last\r\nleaf of an ancient service book of the monastery, known as the\r\nAntiphonary of Bangor (Facsimile edition by F. E. Warren, 1893, vol.\r\nii. p. 33), there is a hymn which gives a complete list of the\r\nabbots--fifteen in number--from Comgall to Cronan (+691), in whose\r\nperiod of office it was written. The site of St. Comgall's monastery\r\nis beside the Rectory of the parish of Bangor, co. Down, about\r\nhalf-a-mile from Bangor Bay, near the entrance to Belfast Lough.\r\n\r\n[289] Rom. vii. 4.\r\n\r\n[290] _Luanus._ This is probably Lugaid, or Molua, the founder of\r\nLismore in Scotland, who died in 592 (_A.U._) and is commemorated on\r\nJune 25 (Oengus, Gorman). He was a Pict and of the same tribe as St.\r\nComgall, both being descended from Fiacha Araide (_L.B._ 15 c, e); and\r\nin later times was the patron saint of the diocese of Argyll (Adamnan,\r\np. 371). He may be the Bishop Lugidus who ordained St. Comgall, and\r\nafterwards restrained him from leaving Ireland (Plummer, i. p. lix.;\r\nii. pp. 6, 7). But there is no evidence, apart from the statement of\r\nSt. Bernard, that either this bishop or Lugaid of Lismore was a member\r\nof the community at Bangor. There is a Life of Lugaid of Lismore in\r\nthe Breviary of Aberdeen (Prop. Sanct. pro temp, aest. ff. 5 _v._ 7;\r\nsummarized in Forbes, _Kalendars of Scottish Saints_, p. 410). His\r\nprincipal foundation after Lismore was Rosemarkie in Ross. Mr. A. B.\r\nScott (_Pictish Nation_, 1918, p. 347 f.) mentions also Mortlach\r\n(Banffshire) and Clova (Aberdeenshire); and Bishop Forbes (_l.c._)\r\nadds other sites with which his name is connected.\r\n\r\n[291] St. Comgall himself is said to have been minded in his earlier\r\ndays to go on pilgrimage to \"Britain,\" and to have been dissuaded\r\ntherefrom by Lugaid (Latin Life, § 13, Plummer, ii. 7). Seven years\r\nafter the foundation of Bangor he went to Britain to visit \"certain\r\nsaints\" (_ibid._ § 22, p. 11). It was probably on this occasion that\r\nhe spent some time on the island of Hinba (Eilean-na-naomh?) in the\r\ncompany of SS. Columba, Canice and others (Adamnan, iii. 17). It was\r\nsomewhat later, apparently, that St. Columba went with some companions\r\non a mission to Brude, king of the Picts (_ibid._ ii. 35); and we need\r\nnot question the statement that Comgall and Canice were among those\r\nwho went with him, though there is reason to doubt that Comgall was\r\nthe leader of the band, as his Life implies (§ 51, p. 18), and though\r\nthe _Life of St. Canice_, which frequently refers to his visit, or\r\nvisits, to Scotland (§§ 17, 19, 21, 23, Plummer, i. 158), never\r\nmentions the incident. It is probable, therefore, that the founder of\r\nBangor took part in the evangelization of Scotland; but the memory of\r\nvery few monasteries founded by him in that country, besides the\r\ncommunity in the island of Tiree (_Life_, § 22, p. 11; see Scott, _op.\r\ncit._ p. 239), has been preserved to later ages. Mr. Scott credits\r\nmembers of the community of Bangor with the foundation of Paisley,\r\nKingarth and Applecross (_ibid._ p. 337 ff.). See also previous note.\r\n\r\n[292] Ps. lxv. 9, 10 (vg., inexact quotation).\r\n\r\n[293] Luke vi. 48.\r\n\r\n[294] Gen. xii. 2.--St. Columbanus was the greatest of the Irish\r\nmissionaries on the Continent of Europe. Born in Leinster, according\r\nto Bruno Krusch (_Ionae Vitae Sanctorum_, p. 22) in 530, or as others\r\nhold in 543, he entered the community of Bangor not long after its\r\nfoundation, and after spending \"many cycles of years\" there, he sailed\r\nfor France about 590. His principal monasteries were Luxeuil\r\n(Luxovium) in the department of Haute Saône, and Bobbio in Lombardy.\r\nAt the latter place he died, November 23, 615. His Life was written by\r\nJonas, about 640. It was critically edited by Krusch in _M.G.H._\r\n(Script. rerum Merovingic., vol. iv. 1-152) and subsequently as a\r\nseparate volume (_Ionae Vitae Sanctorum Columbani, Vedastis,\r\nIohannis_, 1905). The story of his labours has been told by G. T.\r\nStokes in his _Celtic Church in Ireland_, Lect. vii., and by many\r\nother modern writers. See also the collection of documents in Patrick\r\nFleming's _Collectanea_ (Lovanii, 1667). Luxeuil is about eighty miles\r\nfrom Clairvaux, and less than seventy from St. Bernard's early home at\r\nDijon. Fifty years after the death of St. Columbanus it adopted the\r\nrule of St. Benedict. It was a well-known establishment in St.\r\nBernard's day, though by that time its glory had declined. It was\r\nsuppressed in 1789 (M. Stokes, _Three Months in the Forests of\r\nFrance_, p. 67).\r\n\r\n[295] The Acoemetae, founded about the middle of the fifth century,\r\nwere the first to practise the _laus perennis_, from which they\r\nderived their name (_Dict. of Christian Antiquities_, s.v.). It was\r\nadopted in the early years of the following century at the monastery\r\nof St. Maurice in the Valois, from which it spread to many other\r\nreligious establishments (_AA.SS._, Nov., i. 548 ff.).\r\n\r\n[296] _A.U._ 823 (_recte_ 824): \"The plundering of Bangor in the Ards\r\nby Foreigners [_i.e._ Norsemen], and the spoiling of its oratory; and\r\nthe relics of Comgall were shaken out of their shrine.\" _A.I._ add,\r\n\"and its learned men and bishops were slain with the sword.\"\r\n\r\n[297] Gen. ii. 8.\r\n\r\n[298] Matt. xxvii. 52.\r\n\r\n[299] Ecclus. xliv. 14.\r\n\r\n[300] This obviously exaggerated statement may refer to the event\r\nmentioned in note 2, or to a later occasion (958), when \"Tanaidhe, son\r\nof Odhar, coarb of Bangor, was killed by Foreigners\" (_A.U._).\r\n\r\n[301] \"Even at the Dissolution [1539] it was found to be possessed of\r\nthe temporalities and spiritualities of thirty-four townlands,\r\ntogether with the tithes of nine rectories or chapels\" (Reeves, p.\r\n94). The lands included the entire parish of Bangor, together with\r\npart of the adjoining parish of Holywood, and eight outlying townlands\r\n(Archdall, ed. Moran, i. 235).\r\n\r\n[302] This remark is interesting as showing that the title \"abbot of\r\nBangor\" was in use in the twelfth century. The last person to whom it\r\nis given in the _A.U._ is Indrechtach, who died in 906. From that time\r\nonwards \"coarb of Comgall\" (or in one instance, \"coarb of Bangor\") is\r\nsubstituted for it. St. Bernard is supported by the Annals when he\r\nasserts that so-called abbots were elected down to Malachy's time.\r\n_A.U._ preserve the names of twenty abbots or coarbs between 824 and\r\n1123. But St. Bernard leaves the impression that the religious\r\ncommunity of Bangor ceased to exist on its destruction by the Norse\r\npirates, and that subsequently the \"abbots\" merely held the lands that\r\nhad belonged to it, and exercised no spiritual discipline. There are\r\ngood reasons, however, for the contrary opinion. Thus Abbot Moengal,\r\nwho died in 871, was a \"pilgrim.\" Abbot Moenach (died 921) was \"the\r\nhead of the learning of the island of Ireland.\" Ceile, coarb of\r\nComgall, went on pilgrimage to Rome in 928, and died there in 929: he\r\nwas a scribe and anchoret, apostolic doctor of all Ireland, and (if\r\n_C.S._ can be trusted) a bishop. Dubhinnsi, bishop of Bangor, died in\r\n953. Finally, Diarmait Ua Maeltelcha, coarb of Comgall, whom _C.S._\r\ncalls a bishop, died in 1016. It was probably not till after that\r\ndate, as Reeves (p. 154) assures us, that the monastery began to\r\ndecline.\r\n\r\n[303] See §§ 61, 62.\r\n\r\n[304] Matt. xxvii. 51.\r\n\r\n[305] John ii. 11.\r\n\r\n[306] \"Scotic\" is obviously to be understood here in its earlier\r\nmeaning as equivalent to \"Irish.\" From this departure from his\r\nordinary usage (see p. 20, note 1) we may infer that St. Bernard is\r\nquoting the words of his authority. The habit of constructing churches\r\nof wood prevailed in early times among the Celtic and Saxon tribes in\r\nthe British Isles, the introduction of stone building for such\r\npurposes being due to Roman influence (Plummer, _Bede_, ii. 101). The\r\nolder custom lingered longer in Ireland than elsewhere; and by the\r\ntime of Bede it had come to be regarded as characteristically Irish,\r\nthough wooden churches must still have been numerous in England (Bede,\r\n_H.E._, iii. 25). In a document of much later date, the Life of the\r\nIrish Saint Monenna (quoted in Adamnan, p. 177 f.), we read of \"a\r\nchurch constructed of smoothed planks according to the custom of the\r\nScottish races\"; and the writer adds that \"the Scots are not in the\r\nhabit of building walls, or causing them to be built.\" Petrie (pp.\r\n138-151) maintained that stone churches were not unusual in early\r\nIreland; but he admits (pp. 341-344) that one type of church--the\r\noratory (in Irish _dairtheach_, _i.e._ house of oak)--was very rarely\r\nconstructed of stone. The only two passages which he cites (p. 345) as\r\nmentioning stone oratories (he says he might have produced others) are\r\nnot to his purpose. The first is a notice in _A.U._ 788, of a man\r\nbeing killed at the door of a \"stone oratory\": but another, and\r\napparently better, reading substitutes _lapide_ for _lapidei_, thus\r\naltering the entry to a statement that the man was killed \"by a stone\r\nat the door of the oratory.\" The second is Colgan's rendering\r\n(_Trias_, p. 162) of a sentence in _Trip._ iii. 74, p. 232, in which\r\nthere is in reality no mention of any ecclesiastical edifice. So far\r\nas I am aware, there is no indisputable reference in Irish literature\r\nto a stone oratory earlier than the one mentioned below, § 61.\r\n\r\n[307] Cp. the quatrain of Rummun on an oratory which was in course of\r\nconstruction at Rathen (_Otia Merseiana_, ii. 79):\r\n\r\n\"O my Lord! what shall I do About these great materials? When will\r\nthese ten hundred planks Be a structure of compact beauty?\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[308] Evidently until he became bishop. The next sentence implies that\r\nthe time spent at Bangor was of considerable length, as does also the\r\nremark at the end of § 15. St. Bernard, however, seems to have been\r\nmistaken in supposing that Malachy resigned the abbacy on his\r\nconsecration. See p. 36, note 5; p. 40, note 1; p. 80, note 1; p. 104,\r\nnote 3; p. 112, note 5; p. 113, note 1.\r\n\r\n[309] Cp. p. 11, note 1.\r\n\r\n[310] Luke i. 75.\r\n\r\n[311] John xviii. 10.\r\n\r\n[312] For Christian and Mellifont Abbey, see § 39. This Malchus is\r\nmentioned again in § 52.\r\n\r\n[313] This is not a mere conventional phrase. In a passionate outburst\r\nof grief St. Bernard says of his brother Gerard, who had recently\r\ndied, \"He was my brother by blood, yet more my brother in religion\"\r\n(_Cant._ xxvi. 4).\r\n\r\n[314] _Conversus._ Cp. p. 14, note 1. The meaning is that after his\r\nrecovery Malchus entered the community of Bangor.\r\n\r\n[315] Acts ix. 35.\r\n\r\n[316] 2 Kings xviii. 6.\r\n\r\n[317] John v. 14.\r\n\r\n[318] The abbey founded by Malachy at Soulseat. See § 68.\r\n\r\n[319] _Demorabatur_, literally, _lingered_, or _tarried_. The fact\r\nseems to be that Bangor was Malachy's headquarters for the rest of his\r\nlife, except the ten years which intervened between his expulsion from\r\nit (§ 18), and his resignation of the see of Armagh (§ 31). See p. 33,\r\nnote 1. St. Bernard was apparently puzzled by the fact that Malachy\r\ncontinued to live at Bangor after his consecration, instead of going\r\nto the see-city; and he makes a not very satisfactory apology for it.\r\n\r\n[320] The city is evidently Connor; but it is not near Bangor. The\r\ntwo places are twenty-five miles apart, and Belfast Lough lies between\r\nthem. In Malachy's day they were in different tribal territories.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\n_St. Malachy becomes Bishop of Connor; he builds the Monastery of\r\nIveragh._\r\n\r\n\r\n16. (10). At that time an episcopal see was vacant,[321] and had long\r\nbeen vacant, because Malachy would not assent: for they had elected him\r\nto it.[322] But they persisted, and at length he yielded when their\r\nentreaties were enforced by the command of his teacher,[323] together\r\nwith that of the metropolitan.[324] It was when he was just entering the\r\nthirtieth year of his age,[325] that he was consecrated bishop and\r\nbrought to Connor; for that was the name of the city through ignorance\r\nof Irish ecclesiastical affairs St. Bernard misunderstood the\r\ninformation supplied to him, and thus separated Malachy's tenure of the\r\nabbacy of Bangor from his episcopate, though the two were in reality\r\nconterminous. For the significance of Malachy's recall to the North, see\r\nIntroduction, p. liii. f.; and for a fuller discussion, _R.I.A._, xxxv.\r\n250-254..\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1124]\r\n\r\nBut when he began to administer his office, the man of God understood\r\nthat he had been sent not to men but to beasts. Never before had he\r\nknown the like, in whatever depth of barbarism; never had he found men\r\nso shameless in regard of morals, so dead in regard of rites, so impious\r\nin regard of faith, so barbarous in regard of laws, so stubborn in\r\nregard of discipline, so unclean in regard of life. They were Christians\r\nin name, in fact pagans.[326] There was no giving of tithes or\r\nfirst-fruits; no entry into lawful marriages, no making of confessions:\r\nnowhere could be found any who would either seek penance or impose it.\r\nMinisters of the altar were exceeding few. But indeed what need was\r\nthere of more when even the few were almost in idleness and ease among\r\nthe laity? There was no fruit which they could bring forth from their\r\noffices among a people so vile. For in the churches there was not heard\r\nthe voice either of preacher or singer.[327] What was _the athlete of\r\nthe Lord_[328] to do? He must either yield with shame or with danger\r\nfight. But he who recognized that he was _a shepherd and not a\r\nhireling_, elected to stand rather than to _flee_, prepared to _give his\r\nlife for the sheep_ if need be.[329] And although all were wolves and\r\nthere were no sheep, the intrepid shepherd stood in the midst of the\r\nwolves, rich in all means by which he might make sheep out of\r\nwolves[330]--admonishing in public, arguing in secret, weeping with one\r\nand another; accosting men now roughly, now gently, according as he saw\r\nit to be expedient for each. And in cases where these expedients failed\r\nhe offered for them a _broken and a contrite heart_.[331] How often did\r\nhe spend entire nights in vigil, holding out his hands in prayer! And\r\nwhen they would not come to the church he went to meet the unwilling\r\nones _in the streets and in the broad ways_, and _going round about the\r\ncity_, he eagerly _sought_[332] whom he might gain for Christ.\r\n\r\n17. (11). But further afield also, none the less, he very frequently\r\ntraversed country parts and towns with that holy band of disciples, who\r\nnever left his side. He went and bestowed even on _the unthankful[333]\r\ntheir portion of_ the heavenly _meat_.[334] Nor did he ride on a horse,\r\nbut went afoot, in this also proving himself an apostolic man. Good\r\nJesus, _how great things_ thy warrior _suffered for Thy name's\r\nsake_[335] from _crime-stained children_.[336] How great things he\r\nendured for Thee from those very men to whom, and on whose behalf, he\r\nspoke good things. Who can worthily express with how great vexations he\r\nwas harassed, with what insults he was assailed, with what unrighteous\r\nacts provoked,[337] how often he was faint with hunger, how often\r\nafflicted _with cold and nakedness_?[338] Yet _with them that hated\r\npeace he was a peacemaker,[339] instant_, nevertheless, _in season, out\r\nof season_.[340] _Being defamed he intreated_;[341] when he was dealt\r\nwith unrighteously he defended himself with the shield of patience and\r\n_overcame evil with good_.[342] Why should he not overcome? _He\r\ncontinued knocking_,[343] and according to the promise, at length,\r\nsometimes, _to him that knocked it was opened_.[344] How could that not\r\nfollow which _the Truth_[345] had declared beforehand should follow?\r\n_The right hand of the Lord brought mighty things to pass_,[346] because\r\nthe _mouth of the Lord spoke_[347] the truth. Hardness vanished,\r\nbarbarity ceased; the _rebellious house_[348] began gradually to be\r\nappeased, gradually to admit reproof, _to receive discipline_.[349]\r\nBarbarous laws disappear, Roman laws are introduced; everywhere the\r\necclesiastical customs are received, their opposites are rejected;\r\nchurches[350] are rebuilt, a clergy is appointed in them; the\r\nsolemnities of the sacraments are duly celebrated; confessions are made;\r\ncongregations[351] come to the church; the celebration of marriage\r\ngraces those who live together.[352] In fine, all things are so changed\r\nfor the better that to-day the word which the Lord speaks by the prophet\r\nis applicable to that nation; _those who_ before _were not my people are\r\nnow my people_.[353]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1127]\r\n\r\n18. (12). It happened after some years that the city[354] was destroyed\r\nby the king of the northern part of Ireland;[355] for _out of the north_\r\nall _evil breaks forth_.[356] And perhaps that evil was good for those\r\nwho used it well. For who knows that God did not wish to destroy by such\r\na scourge the ancient evils of His people? By a necessity so dire\r\nMalachy was compelled, and he retired with a crowd of his disciples. Nor\r\nwas his retirement spent in idleness. It gave opportunity for building\r\nthe monastery of Iveragh,[357] Malachy going there with his brothers,\r\nin number one hundred and twenty.[358] There King Cormac met him. He it\r\nwas who at a former time driven out of his kingdom, under the care of\r\nMalachy by the mercy of God received consolation;[359] and that place\r\nwas in his kingdom. The king rejoiced to see Malachy, placing at the\r\ndisposal of him and those who were with him himself and all that he\r\nhad--as one who was neither ungrateful nor unmindful of a benefit. Many\r\nbeasts were immediately brought for the use of the brothers; much gold\r\nand silver was also supplied, with regal munificence, for the expense of\r\nthe buildings. He himself also _was coming in and going out with\r\nthem_,[360] busy and ready to serve--in attire a king, but in mind a\r\ndisciple of Malachy. And the Lord _blessed_ that place _for_ Malachy's\r\n_sake_,[361] and in a short time he was made great in goods, possessions\r\nand persons. And there, as it were beginning anew, the burden of law and\r\ndiscipline which he laid on others he bore with greater zeal himself,\r\ntheir bishop and teacher. Himself, _in the order of his course_,[362]\r\ndid duty as cook, himself served the brothers while they sat at\r\nmeat.[363] Among the brothers who succeeded one another in singing or\r\nreading in church he did not suffer himself to be passed over, but\r\nstrenuously fulfilled the office in his place as one of them. He not\r\nonly shared but took the lead in [the life] of holy poverty, being\r\nespecially zealous for it _more abundantly than they all_.[364]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[321] Connor: see below. It is clear that after Malachy's consecration\r\nit was the see of a diocese which included Bangor (§ 15) and Down, the\r\npresent Downpatrick (§ 31). The inference is highly probable that it\r\nincluded the whole district which constituted the \"parish [_i.e._\r\ndiocese] of Connor,\" according to the decree of the Synod of\r\nRathbreasail in 1110 (Keating, iii. 303: see above p. xli), that is to\r\nsay, roughly, the present united dioceses of Down, Connor and Dromore.\r\nIt would seem that Malachy was its first bishop.\r\n\r\n[322] Here, again, St. Bernard implies that a long period elapsed\r\nbetween Malachy's return from Lismore and his consecration; for the\r\nreason given in § 12 for his recall is inconsistent with the\r\nsupposition that he had already been elected to a bishopric which\r\nCellach and Imar wished him to accept. They desired to have him with\r\nthem at Armagh. He must have been \"elected\" either while he was at\r\nArmagh or after he went to Bangor.\r\n\r\n[323] Imar.\r\n\r\n[324] Cellach. See § 19, where Cellach and his predecessors are called\r\nmetropolitans.\r\n\r\n[325] _Tricesimo ferme aetatis suae anno._ _A.F.M._ record under the\r\nyear 1124 that \"Mael Maedoc Ua Morgair sat in the bishopric of\r\nConnor.\" This agrees with the date of his consecration as given here.\r\nSee p. 128, note 1. He was consecrated bishop by Cellach (§ 19).\r\n\r\nWe have seen (p. 20, note 3) that Malachy probably went to Lismore\r\nlate in 1121. He spent several years there, and, according to St.\r\nBernard, another long period at Armagh and Bangor before his\r\nconsecration in 1124. This must be pronounced impossible. The most\r\nprobable solution of the chronological difficulty is that through\r\nignorance of Irish ecclesiastical affairs St. Bernard misunderstood\r\nthe information supplied to him, and thus separated Malachy's tenure\r\nof the abbacy of Bangor from his episcopate, though the two were in\r\nreality conterminous.

The word city (_civitas_), which he no doubt found in his\r\nauthority, might be applied, like its Irish equivalent, _cathair_, to\r\neither place: but to St. Bernard it would naturally suggest an\r\nepiscopal see. Connor was within the suzerainty of the king of the\r\nnorthern part of Ireland, Bangor was outside it. See next note.\r\n\r\n[355] Conor O'Loughlin, who is called king of the north of Ireland in\r\nthe Annals (s.a. 1136). He succeeded his father Donnell as king of\r\nAilech (Grenan Ely, co. Donegal, the residence of the kings of the\r\nnorthern Ui Neill) in 1121, and the next year he invaded the northern\r\npart of Ulaid, the district in which Bangor is situated. He invaded\r\nMagh Cobha (Iveagh, co. Down) and Bregha (Meath), with the help of the\r\nDal Araide (the district round Connor, co. Antrim) in 1128. He finally\r\nsubdued Ulaid in 1130, and \"plundered the country as far as the east\r\nof Ard [_i.e._ the baronies of the Ards, in which lies Bangor], both\r\nlay and ecclesiastical property.\" He was murdered on May 25, 1136\r\n(_A.U._, _A.L.C._). It has been supposed that the expedition of 1130\r\nwas the occasion of the destruction of Bangor mentioned in the text.\r\nBut St. Bernard places it, and the consequent departure of Malachy to\r\nthe south, before the death of Cellach in 1129 (§ 19), and we have\r\nfound reason to believe that Malachy was at Lismore in 1127 (p. 21, n.\r\n3). Though no raid by Conor in that year is referred to in the Annals,\r\nthat fact cannot be regarded as proof that none took place.\r\n\r\n[356] Jer. i. 14.\r\n\r\n[357] _Ibracense._ That this monastery was in Iveragh, a barony in the\r\ncounty of Kerry, north of the estuary of the Kenmare River, and in\r\nCormac Mac Carthy's kingdom of Desmond, was apparently first suggested\r\nby Lanigan (iv. 92). The identification is almost certainly correct.\r\nIt is more difficult to determine the part of the barony in which the\r\nmonastery was situated. O'Hanlon suggested Church Island, near\r\nCahirciveen, where there are some ecclesiastical remains,\r\ntraditionally known half a century ago as \"the monastery\" (_R.I.A._\r\nxv. 107). But these appear to be of much earlier date than the twelfth\r\ncentury. More plausible is the conjecture of the Rev. Denis\r\nO'Donoghue, that the site is on another Church Island, in Lough\r\nCurrane, near Waterville. On it are the ruins of a church which, in\r\nthe opinion of Mr. P. J. Lynch, was built in the twelfth century\r\n(_J.R.S.A.I._ xxx. 159 f.). Malachy seems to have spent some time at\r\nLismore before going to Iveragh.\r\n\r\n[358] This sentence seems to imply that Malachy brought with him the\r\nBangor community, or the greater part of it, and made a new home for\r\nit in Iveragh. If so the inference is obvious that up to 1127 Malachy\r\nresided at Bangor, and was still abbot.\r\n\r\n[359] See §§ 9, 10.\r\n\r\n[360] Acts ix. 28 (inexact quotation).\r\n\r\n[361] Gen. xxx. 27.\r\n\r\n[362] Luke i. 8.\r\n\r\n[363] Cp. Luke xii. 37; xxii. 27.\r\n\r\n[364] Cp. 1 Cor. xv. 10; 2 Cor. xi. 23.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_Being made Archbishop of Armagh, he suffers many troubles. Peace being\r\nmade, from being Archbishop of Armagh he becomes Bishop of Down._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1129]\r\n\r\n19. (12). Meanwhile[365] it happened that Archbishop Cellach[366] fell\r\nsick: he it was who ordained Malachy deacon, presbyter and bishop: and\r\nknowing that he was dying he made a sort of testament[367] to the effect\r\nthat Malachy ought to succeed him,[368] because none seemed worthier to\r\nbe bishop of the first see. This he gave in charge to those who were\r\npresent, this he commanded to the absent, this to the two kings of\r\nMunster[369] and to the magnates of the land he specially enjoined by\r\nthe authority of St. Patrick.[370] For from reverence and honour for\r\nhim, as the apostle of that nation, who had converted the whole country\r\nto the faith, that see where he presided in life and rests in death[371]\r\nhas been held in so great veneration by all from the beginning, that not\r\nmerely bishops and priests, and those who are of the clergy, but also\r\nall kings and princes are subject to the metropolitan[372] in all\r\nobedience, and he himself alone presides over all. But a very evil\r\ncustom had developed, by the devilish ambition of certain powerful\r\npersons, that the holy see[373] should be held by hereditary succession.\r\nFor they suffered none to be bishops but those who were of their own\r\ntribe and family. And for no short time had the execrable succession\r\nlasted, for fifteen generations (as I may call them)[374] had already\r\npassed in this wickedness. And to such a point had _an evil and\r\nadulterous[375] generation_[376] established for itself this distorted\r\nright, rather this unrighteousness worthy of punishment by any sort of\r\ndeath, that although at times clerics failed of that blood, yet bishops\r\nnever. In a word there had been already eight before Cellach, married\r\nmen, and without orders, albeit men of letters.[377] Hence, throughout\r\nthe whole of Ireland, all that subversion of ecclesiastical discipline,\r\nthat weakening of censure, that abandonment of religion of which we\r\nhave spoken already; hence everywhere that substitution of raging\r\nbarbarism for Christian meekness--yea, a sort of paganism brought in\r\nunder the name of Christianity. For--a thing unheard of from the very\r\nbeginning of the Christian faith--bishops were transferred and\r\nmultiplied, without order or reason, at the will of the metropolitan, so\r\nthat one bishopric was not content with one bishop, but nearly every\r\nsingle church had its bishop.[378] No wonder; for how could the members\r\nof so diseased a head be sound?\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1132]\r\n\r\n20. Cellach, greatly grieving for these and other like evils of his\r\npeople--for he was a good and devout man--took all care to have Malachy\r\nas his successor, because he believed that by him this evilly rooted\r\nsuccession might be torn up,[379] since he was dear to all, and one whom\r\nall were zealous to imitate, _and the Lord was with him_.[380] Nor was\r\nhe deceived of his hope; for when he died Malachy was put into\r\noccupation in his room. But not soon nor easily. For behold there is one\r\nof the evil seed to seize the place--Murtough by name.[381] For five\r\nyears, relying on the secular power,[382] this man fastened himself\r\nupon the church, not a bishop but a tyrant. For the wishes of the devout\r\nhad rather supported the claim of Malachy. At last they urged him to\r\nundertake the burden according to the ordinance of Cellach. But he, who\r\nshunned every high office as nothing else than his downfall,[383]\r\nthought that he had found good ground of excuse, because at that time it\r\nwas impossible that he should have a peaceful entry. All were eager for\r\nso holy a work and pressed him; especially the two bishops, Malchus[384]\r\nand Gilbert,[385] of whom the former was the elder[386] of Lismore\r\nmentioned above, the second he who is said to have been the first to\r\nexercise the office of legate of the Apostolic See throughout the whole\r\nof Ireland. These, when three years had now passed in this presumption\r\nof Murtough and dissimulation of Malachy,[387] tolerating no longer the\r\nadultery of the church and the dishonour of Christ, called together the\r\nbishops and princes of the land,[388] and came, in one spirit, to\r\nMalachy, prepared to use force. But he refused at first; pleading the\r\ndifficulty of the project, the numbers, strength and ambition of that\r\nnoble stock, urging that it was a great venture for him, a poor man and\r\nof no account, to oppose himself to men so many, so great, of such sort,\r\nso deeply rooted, who now for well-nigh two hundred years had _held_ as\r\n_by hereditary right the sanctuary of God_,[389] and now also had taken\r\npossession of it before him; that they could not be rooted out, not even\r\nat the cost of human life; that it was not to his advantage that _man's\r\nblood should be shed_[390] on his account; and lastly, that he was\r\njoined to another spouse[391] whom _it was_ not _lawful for him to put\r\naway_.[392]\r\n\r\n21. (14). But when they persisted eagerly in the contrary opinion, and\r\ncried out that the _word had come forth from the Lord_,[393] and\r\nmoreover ordered him with all authority to undertake the burden, and\r\nthreatened him with an anathema, he said, \"You are leading me to death,\r\nbut I obey in the hope of martyrdom; yet on this condition, that if, as\r\nyou expect, the enterprise has good success, and God frees his\r\n_heritage_ from _those that are destroying_ it,[394] all being then at\r\nlength completed, and the church[395] at peace, it may be lawful for me\r\nto return to my former spouse and friend, poverty,[396] from which I am\r\ncarried off, and to put in my place there another, if then one is found\r\nfit for it.\" Note, reader, the courage of the man and the purity of his\r\npurpose who, for Christ's name, neither sought honour nor dreaded death.\r\nWhat could be purer or what braver than this purpose, that after\r\nexposing himself to peril and labour he should yield to another the\r\nfruit--peace and security itself in the place of authority? And this he\r\ndoes, retaining for himself according to agreement a free return to\r\npoverty when peace and freedom are restored to the church. When they\r\ngave the pledge, at length he assented to their will; or rather to the\r\nwill of God, who, he remembered, had long foreshown to him this\r\noccurrence, at the fulfilment of which he was now grieved. For indeed\r\nwhen Cellach was already ailing there appeared to Malachy--far away and\r\nignorant [of Cellach's condition]--a woman of great stature and reverend\r\nmien. When he inquired who she was, the answer was given that she was\r\nthe wife of Cellach.[397] And she gave him a pastoral staff which she\r\nheld in her hand, and then disappeared. A few days later, Cellach, when\r\nhe was dying, sent his staff to Malachy, indicating that he should\r\nsucceed him: and when he saw it he recognized that it was the same which\r\nhe had seen [in vision]. It was the remembrance of this vision which\r\nspecially put Malachy in fear, lest if he still refused he might seem to\r\n_resist_ the Divine _will_, which he had ignored long enough.[398] But\r\nhe did not enter the city as long as that intruder lived, lest by such\r\nact it should happen that any one of those should die to whom he came\r\nrather to minister life. Thus for two years (for so long the other\r\nsurvived), living outside the town, he strenuously performed the\r\nepiscopal office throughout the whole province.[399]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1134, Sept. 17]\r\n\r\n22. (15). When that person, then, had been removed by sudden death,[400]\r\nagain one Niall [_Nigellus_] (in truth _nigerrimus_, very black)[401]\r\nquickly took possession of the see. And in appointing him as his\r\nsuccessor, Murtough, while he was still alive, _made provision for his\r\nlife_:[402] he was going forth to be damned, but in the person of Niall\r\nhe would go on adding to the works of damnation.[403] For he also was\r\nof the damned race, a relative of Murtough.[404] But the king[405] and\r\nthe bishops and faithful of the land nevertheless came together that\r\nthey might bring in Malachy. And lo, there was an _assembly of the\r\nwicked_[406] to oppose them.[407] A certain man of the sons of Belial,\r\nready for _mischief, mighty in iniquity_,[408] who _knew the place_\r\nwhere they had decided _to come together_,[409] gathered many with him\r\nand secretly seized a neighbouring high hill opposite to it, intending,\r\nwhen they were engaged with other things, suddenly to rush upon them\r\nunawares and _murder the innocent_.[410] For they had agreed to butcher\r\nthe king also with the bishop, that there might be none to _avenge the\r\nrighteous blood_.[411] The plan became known to Malachy, and he entered\r\nthe church, which was close by, and lifted up his hands in prayer to\r\nthe Lord. Lo, there came _clouds and darkness_,[412] yea also _dark\r\nwaters and thick clouds of the skies[413] changed the day into\r\nnight_,[414] _lightnings and thunderings_[415] and _an horrible spirit\r\nof tempests_[416] presaged the last day, _and all_ the elements\r\n_threatened_ speedy _death_.[417]\r\n\r\n23. But that you may know, reader, that it was the prayer of Malachy\r\nthat roused the elements, the tempest fell upon those _who sought his\r\nlife_,[418] the _dark whirlwind_[419] enveloped only those who had made\r\nready _the works of darkness_.[420] Finally, he who was the leader of so\r\ngreat wickedness was struck by a thunderbolt and perished with three\r\nothers, companions in death as they had been partners in crime; and the\r\nnext day their bodies were found half-burnt and putrid, clinging to the\r\nbranches of trees, each where the wind[421] _had lifted him up and cast\r\nhim down_.[422] Three others also were found half dead; the rest were\r\nall scattered in every direction. But, as for those who were with\r\nMalachy, though they were close to the place, the storm _touched them\r\nnot at all, neither troubled them_.[423] In that fact we find fresh\r\nproof of the truth of that saying, _The prayer of the righteous pierceth\r\nthe heavens._[424] It is also a new example of the ancient miracle, by\r\nwhich in former times, when all Egypt was in darkness, Israel alone\r\nremained in light, as the Scripture says, _Wheresoever Israel was there\r\nwas light._[425] In this connexion occurs to me also what holy Elijah\r\ndid, at one time bringing clouds and rain from the ends of the\r\nearth,[426] at another, calling down fire from heaven on the\r\nrevilers.[427] And now in like manner _God is glorified in_[428] His\r\nservant Malachy.\r\n\r\n24. (16). In the thirty-eighth year of his age,[429] the usurper having\r\nbeen driven out, the poor man, Malachy, entered Armagh, pontiff and\r\nmetropolitan of all Ireland. But when the king and the others who had\r\nbrought him in returned home,[430] he remained _in the hand of\r\nGod_;[431] and there remained for him _without fightings, within\r\nfears_.[432] For, lo, the viperous brood, raging and crying out that it\r\nwas disinherited, aroused itself in full strength, within and without,\r\n_against the Lord and against His Anointed_.[433] Moreover, Niall,\r\nseeing that flight was inevitable,[434] took with him certain insignia\r\nof that see, to wit, the copy of the Gospels, which had belonged to\r\nblessed Patrick,[435] and the staff covered with gold and adorned with\r\nmost costly gems, which they call \"the staff of Jesus,\" because the Lord\r\nhimself (as report affirms) held it in His hands and fashioned it;[436]\r\nwhich are deemed of the highest honour and sanctity in that nation. They\r\nare, in fact, very well known and celebrated among the tribes, and so\r\nrevered by all, that he who is once seen to have them is held by the\r\n_foolish and unwise people_[437] to be their bishop. That man--a\r\nvagabond[438] and another _Satan_--_went to and fro in the land and\r\nwalked up and down in it_,[439] bearing round the holy insignia; and,\r\ndisplaying them everywhere, he was for their sake everywhere received,\r\nby them winning the minds of all to himself, and withdrawing as many as\r\nhe could from Malachy. These things did he.\r\n\r\n25. But there was a certain prince, of the more powerful of the\r\nunrighteous race,[440] whom the king before he left the city, had\r\ncompelled to swear that he would maintain peace with the bishop, taking\r\nfrom him, moreover, many hostages. Notwithstanding this, when the king\r\nleft he entered the city, and took _counsel_ with his kinsmen and\r\nfriends _how they might take_ the holy man _by subtlety and kill him;\r\nbut they feared the people_;[441] and having conspired to slay\r\nMalachy[442] they fixed a place and day, and a traitor _gave them a\r\nsign_.[443] On that very day, when the prelate was now celebrating the\r\nsolemnity of Vespers in the church with the whole of the clergy and a\r\nmultitude of the people, that worthless man sent him a message in _words\r\nof peace with subtlety_,[444] asking him that he would deign to come\r\ndown to him, so that he might make peace. The bystanders answered that\r\nhe should rather come to the bishop, and that the church was a more\r\nsuitable place for establishing peace; for they foresaw guile. The\r\nmessengers replied that this was not safe for the prince; that he\r\nfeared for his head, and that he did not trust himself to the crowds\r\nwho, some days before, had nearly killed him for the bishop's sake. As\r\nthey were contending in this way, these saying that he should go, those\r\nthat he should not go, the bishop, desiring peace and not afraid to die,\r\nsaid, \"Brethren, let me imitate my Master.[445] I am a Christian to no\r\npurpose if I do not _follow_ Christ.[446] Perhaps by humility I shall\r\nbend the tyrant; if not, yet I shall conquer by rendering, a shepherd to\r\na sheep, a priest to a layman, that duty which he owed to me. You also,\r\nas far as in me lies, I shall edify not a little by such an example. For\r\nwhat if I should chance to be killed? _I refuse not to die_,[447] in\r\norder that from me you may have an example of life. It behoves a bishop,\r\nas the prince of bishops says, not _to be lord over the clergy, but to\r\nbecome an example to the flock_[448]--no other example[449] truly than\r\nthat which we have received from Him _who humbled himself and became\r\nobedient unto death_.[450] Who will give me [the opportunity] to leave\r\nthis [example] to [my] sons, sealed with my blood? Try, at any rate,\r\nwhether your priest has worthily learnt from Christ not to fear death\r\nfor Christ.\" And he arose and went his way, all weeping, and praying\r\nthat he would not so greatly desire to die for Christ that he should\r\nleave desolate so great a flock of Christ.\r\n\r\n26. (17). But as for him, _setting his whole hope_ in the Lord,[451] he\r\nwent with all speed accompanied only by three disciples who were _ready\r\nto die with him_.[452] _When he crossed the threshold_[453] of the house\r\nand suddenly came into the midst of the armed men--himself protected by\r\nthe _shield of faith_[454]--the _countenances_ of them all _fell_,[455]\r\nfor _dread fell upon them_,[456] so that the bishop could say, _Mine\r\nenemies which trouble me became weak and fell._[457] This _word is\r\ntrue_.[458] You might see the victim standing, the slaughterers\r\nsurrounding him on all sides, with weapons in their hands; and there was\r\nnone to sacrifice him. You might suppose their arms were benumbed; for\r\nthere was none to stretch out a hand. For even that one also, who seemed\r\nto be the head of the evil, rose up, not to assail him but to show him\r\nreverence. Where is the sign, O man, which you had given for the death\r\nof the pontiff? This is a sign rather of honour than death; this\r\npostpones, it does not hasten death. Wonderful result! They offer peace\r\nwho had prepared slaughter. He cannot refuse it who had sought it at the\r\nrisk of life. Therefore peace was made--a peace so firm that from that\r\nday the priest found his foe not merely appeased, but obedient,\r\ndevoted.[459] When they heard this, all the faithful rejoiced, not only\r\nbecause _the innocent blood was saved in that day_,[460] but because by\r\nthe merits of Malachy the souls of many wrongdoers escaped to salvation.\r\nAnd fear took hold on all that were round about when they heard how God\r\nhad laid low, with sudden power, those two of His enemies who seemed\r\nmost ferocious and powerful _in their generation_:[461] I refer to him\r\nwith whom we are now concerned, and the other of whom I spoke\r\nabove.[462] For in a wonderful manner He _took them_ both--one terribly\r\npunished in the body,[463] the other mercifully changed in\r\nheart[464]--_in the devices that they had imagined_.[465]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1135, July(?)]\r\n\r\n27. These matters so accomplished, the bishop now began to dispose and\r\norder in the city all things pertaining to his ministry with entire\r\nfreedom, but not without constant risk of his life. For though there was\r\nno one now who would harm him openly, yet the bishop had no place that\r\nwas safe from plotters, and no time when he could be at ease; and armed\r\nmen were appointed to guard him day and night, though he rather _trusted\r\nin the Lord_.[466] But his purpose was to take action against the\r\nschismatic already mentioned, forasmuch as he was seducing many by means\r\nof the insignia which he carried about, persuading all that he ought to\r\nbe bishop, and so stirring up the congregations[467] against Malachy and\r\nthe unity of the church.[468] And thus he did; and without difficulty in\r\na short time he so _hedged up_ all _his ways[469] through the grace\r\ngiven unto him by the Lord_,[470] and which he had toward all, that that\r\nevil one was compelled to surrender, to return the insignia,[471] and\r\nhenceforth to be quiet in _all subjection_.[472] Thus Malachy, albeit\r\nthrough many perils and labours, prospered day by day and was\r\nstrengthened, _abounding_ more and more _in hope and the power of the\r\nHoly Ghost_.[473]\r\n\r\n28. (18). And God swept away, not only those who did evil to Malachy,\r\nbut also those who disparaged him. A certain man, for example, who was\r\nin favour with the princes and magnates, and even with the king\r\nhimself,[474] because he was a flatterer and garrulous and _mighty in\r\ntongue_,[475] befriended Malachy's opponents in all things, and\r\nimpudently maintained their contention. On the other hand, when the\r\nsaint was present, he _withstood him to the face_,[476] and when he was\r\nabsent he disparaged him. Moreover he accosted him rudely everywhere,\r\nand especially when he knew that he was engaged in the more frequented\r\nassemblies. But he was soon visited with a suitable reward of his\r\nimpudent tongue. The evil-speaking tongue swelled, and _became putrid\r\nand worms swarmed_ from it[477] and filled the whole blasphemous mouth.\r\nHe vomited them forth incessantly for well-nigh seven days, and at\r\nlength with them spued out his wretched soul.\r\n\r\n29. Once when Malachy was speaking before the people and exhorting\r\nthem, a certain unhappy woman dared to interrupt his discourse with evil\r\ncries, showing no respect to the priest _and the Spirit which\r\nspake_.[478] Now she was of the impious race; and having _breath in her\r\nnostrils_[479] she vomited out blasphemies and insults against the\r\nsaint, saying that he was a hypocrite, and an invader of the inheritance\r\nof another, and even reproaching him for his baldness. But he, modest\r\nand gentle as he was, _answered_ her _nothing_;[480] but the Lord\r\nanswered for him. The woman became insane by the judgement of the Lord,\r\nand crying out many times that she was being suffocated by Malachy, at\r\nlength by a horrible death she expiated the sin of blasphemy. So this\r\nwretched woman, taking up against Malachy the reproach that had been\r\nmade against Elisha,[481] found to her cost that he was indeed another\r\nElisha.\r\n\r\n30. Further, because on account of a certain pestilence which arose in\r\nthe city, he had solemnly led out a multitude of the clergy and people\r\nwith the memorial of the saints,[482] neither is this to be passed over,\r\nthat when Malachy prayed the pestilence immediately ceased.\r\nThenceforward there was none to murmur against him, for those who were\r\nof the _seed of Canaan[483] said, Let us flee from the face of_ Malachy,\r\n_for the Lord fighteth for him_.[484] But it was too late, for the\r\nwrath of the Lord, coming everywhere upon them, pursued them _even unto\r\ndestruction_.[485] How, in a few days, _is their memorial perished with\r\nresounding noise;[486] how are they brought into desolation, they are\r\nconsumed in a moment, they are punished for their iniquity_.[487] A\r\ngreat miracle to-day is the extinction of that generation, so quickly\r\nwrought, especially for those who knew their pride and power.[488] And\r\n_many other signs truly_[489] were there by which God glorified His name\r\nand strengthened His servant amidst labours and dangers. Who can\r\nworthily recount them? Yet we do not omit them all, though we have not\r\nability to describe all. But that the sequence of the narrative may not\r\nbe interrupted we reserve to the end some that we propose to mention.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1137]\r\n\r\n31. (19). So then Malachy, when within three years[490] _a reward was\r\nrendered to the proud_[491] and liberty restored to the church,\r\nbarbarism driven out and the customs of the Christian religion\r\neverywhere instituted anew, seeing that all things were at peace, began\r\nto think also of his own peace. And mindful of his design he appointed\r\nin his own place Gelasius,[492] a good man, and worthy of so great an\r\nhonour, the clergy and people tacitly assenting, or rather supporting\r\nhim because of the agreement.[493] For apart from that it seemed\r\naltogether cruel. And when he had been consecrated and earnestly\r\ncommended to the kings and princes, Malachy himself, renowned for\r\nmiracles and triumphs, returned to his parish;[494] but not to Connor.\r\nHear the cause, which is worth relating. It is said that that diocese in\r\nancient times had two episcopal sees, and that there were two\r\nbishoprics; an arrangement which seemed to Malachy preferable to the\r\nexisting one. Hence those bishoprics which ambition had welded into\r\none,[495] Malachy divided again into two, yielding one part to another\r\nbishop and retaining the other for himself. And for this reason he did\r\nnot come to Connor, because he had already ordained a bishop in it;[496]\r\nbut he betook himself to Down, separating the parishes _as in the days\r\nof old_.[497] O pure heart! O dove-like eye![498] He handed over to the\r\nnew bishop the place which seemed better organized, which was held to be\r\nmore important, the place in which he himself had sat. Where are they\r\nthat fight about boundaries, carrying on perpetual hostilities against\r\none another for a single village? I know not if there is any class of\r\nmen whom that ancient prophecy touches more than those: _They have\r\nripped up the women with child of Gilead that they might enlarge their\r\nborder._[499] But this at another place.[500]\r\n\r\n32. When Malachy was made bishop of Down, immediately according to his\r\ncustom he was at pains to take to himself from his sons, for his\r\ncomfort, a convent of regular clerics.[501] And lo, again he girds\r\nhimself, as though a new recruit of Christ, for the spiritual conflict;\r\nagain he puts on the _weapons_ that are _mighty through God_,[502] the\r\nhumility of holy poverty, the rigour of monastic discipline, the\r\nquietness of contemplation, continuance in prayer. But all these things\r\nfor a long time he was able to maintain rather in will than in deed. For\r\nall men came to him; not only obscure persons, but also nobles and\r\nmagnates, hastened to commit themselves to his wisdom and holiness for\r\ninstruction and correction. And he himself meanwhile went about; _he\r\nwent out to sow his seed_,[503] disposing and decreeing with all\r\nauthority concerning ecclesiastical affairs, like one of the Apostles.\r\nAnd none _said unto him, By what authority doest thou these\r\nthings_?[504] inasmuch as all _saw the miracles_ and wonders _which_ he\r\ndid,[505] and because _where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is\r\nliberty_.[506]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[365] That is, while Malachy was in Iveragh.\r\n\r\n[366] Cellach is here mentioned by name for the first time. See p. 14,\r\nn. 2.\r\n\r\n[367] Harris (_Ware's Works_, ii., \"Writers,\" p. 69) identifies this\r\ntestament with the _Testamentum ad ecclesias_, a tract attributed to\r\nCellach, which is apparently no longer extant. But it may be doubted\r\nwhether the testament mentioned in the text was committed to writing.\r\n\r\n[368] The designation by a coarb of his successor seems to have been\r\nunusual. But in 1124 Malachy had in this way been appointed abbot of\r\nBangor (§ 12); and in 1134 Murtough designated Niall as his successor\r\nin the abbacy of Armagh (§ 22).\r\n\r\n[369] Conor O'Brien, king of Thomond, and Cormac Mac Carthy, king of\r\nDesmond. See § 9, and p. 21, notes 1-3. Murtough O'Brien, king of\r\nMunster, fell into ill-health in 1114, and his brother Dermot\r\nattempted, evidently with some success, to seize the throne. Dermot\r\ndied in 1118 and Murtough early in the following year. Turlough\r\nO'Conor, the powerful king of Connaught, promptly invaded Munster, and\r\ndivided it into two vassal kingdoms, Thomond and Desmond. The former\r\nhe gave to the sons of Dermot, of whom Conor was one, the latter to\r\nTeague Mac Carthy. Apparently Conor O'Brien soon established himself\r\nas sole king of Thomond, and Cormac Mac Carthy became king of Desmond\r\non the death of his father, Teague, in 1124. We have seen that both of\r\nthem were deposed in 1127, and quickly restored (§ 9 f.: see p. 21, n.\r\n3; p. 23, n. 2). From that time Conor and Cormac were allies. Cormac\r\nmarried Conor's niece (_A.T._ 1138). Together in 1133 they invaded\r\nConnaught (_A.F.M._), and the next year they made another successful\r\nexpedition through Connaught into Ulster (then ruled by Conor\r\nO'Loughlin; see p. 40, n. 2), in the course of which they burned the\r\nchurch of Rathluraigh, now Maghera, co. Derry, near the border of the\r\ndiocese of Armagh (_D.A.I._). This expedition must be referred to\r\nhereafter (p. 51, n. 2). But Conor evidently aspired to be _ardrí_ of\r\nIreland, and he found it desirable to remove a possible rival.\r\nAccordingly Cormac was murdered by his father-in-law, Conor's brother,\r\nin 1138, and Conor became king of all Munster. He was now the most\r\npowerful prince in Ireland; but he died, after a lingering illness\r\n(Tundale, p. 42), in 1142, without attaining his ambition.\r\n\r\nIt is clear from the present passage that Conor O'Brien followed in\r\nthe footsteps of his predecessors in the same family as a supporter of\r\nthe new movement in the Irish Church. Cormac, as we know, was the\r\nfriend and disciple of Malachy: his devotion to the Church is\r\nwitnessed to by the beautiful edifice built by him at Cashel, still\r\nknown as \"Cormac's Chapel,\" which was consecrated in 1134; and by his\r\ntitle of \"Bishop-King,\" which has been the subject of so much\r\ndiscussion. See Petrie, pp. 283-307; and for the crozier found in\r\nCormac's supposed tomb, G. Coffey, _Guide to the Celtic Antiquities of\r\nthe Christian Period in the National Museum, Dublin_, p. 64. But it\r\nmust be added that the contemporary Vision of Tundale, which\r\napparently emanated from Cormac's kingdom of Desmond, while bearing\r\nemphatic testimony to his generosity to \"Christ's poor and pilgrims,\"\r\ncharges him with heinous crimes strangely inconsistent with St.\r\nBernard's sketch of his character (Tundale, p. 44 f.).\r\n\r\n[370] It seems that the successor (coarb) of the founder of a church\r\nwas supposed to speak with his authority. Cp. the Epistle of Cummian\r\nin Ussher, p. 442.\r\n\r\n[371] Cp. § 65. It is generally believed that St. Patrick was buried\r\nat Downpatrick (see Reeves, p. 223 ff.); but Olden contended (not\r\nconvincingly) that the statement made here by St. Bernard is correct\r\n(_R.I.A._ xviii, 655 ff.), while Bury (_Life of St. Patrick_, p. 211)\r\nhas \"little hesitation in deciding that the obscure grave was at\r\nSaul.\"\r\n\r\n[372] This word cannot have been in St. Bernard's document, for it is\r\nunknown in early Irish ecclesiastical terminology, and in Irish\r\nhierarchical arrangements it would have no meaning. The context proves\r\nthat the persons to whom it is here applied are the abbots of Armagh,\r\nof whom Cellach was one. It probably represents a Latin rendering of\r\n\"coarb (successor) of Patrick,\" a title commonly given to the abbots\r\nof this period. The document portrayed the coarbs as rulers of the\r\nchurch of Armagh. St. Bernard would naturally infer that they were\r\nbishops. When he found that their authority extended beyond Armagh he\r\nwould no less naturally style them archbishops or metropolitans. Cp.\r\nSerm. i, § 6, where the story of §§ 19-31 is briefly summarized.\r\n\r\n[373] Armagh.\r\n\r\n[374] _Quasi generationibus quindecim._ The \"quasi-generations\" are\r\napparently the periods of office of successive coarbs. St. Bernard\r\nseems to have written \"fifteen\" in mistake for \"twelve.\" See\r\nAdditional Note B, p. 165.\r\n\r\n[375] Adulterous, because it took possession of the church, which\r\nshould have been married to true bishops. Cp. § 20, \"the adultery of\r\nthe church,\" Malachy \"being joined to another spouse;\" § 21, Malachy's\r\n\"former spouse,\" and the vision of Cellach's wife.\r\n\r\n[376] Matt. xii. 39; xvi. 4.\r\n\r\n[377] On the statements in these sentences, see Additional Note B.\r\n\r\n[378] That bishops were numerous in Ireland at this period is\r\nindubitable. Fifty attended the Synod of Fiadh meic Oengusa (_A.U._\r\n1111), and probably all of them came from the provinces of Ulster and\r\nMunster (above, p. xxxviii). But this cannot have been due to the\r\nirregularities at Armagh of which St. Bernard complains. There were\r\nmany bishops in Ireland in its earliest Christian period. See Reeves,\r\n123-136; Todd, 27 ff.\r\n\r\n[379] Malachy was not of the Clann Sinaich, to which at this period\r\nthe coarbs of Patrick belonged. See p. 6, n. 5, and Additional Note B,\r\np. 165.\r\n\r\n[380] 1 Sam. iii. 19, etc.\r\n\r\n[381] Cellach died on April 1, 1129, and was buried at Lismore on\r\nApril 4. On April 5, the day after his funeral, Murtough was appointed\r\ncoarb (_A.U._).\r\n\r\n[382] He was probably supported by Conor O'Loughlin, who was king of\r\nOriel, the district in which Armagh was situated (_A.F.M._ 1136). On\r\nhim see p. 40, n. 2. The \"five years\" are the period from Murtough's\r\nelection to his death, September 17, 1134 (_A.F.M._)--nearly five\r\nyears and a half.\r\n\r\n[383] Geoffrey, St. Bernard's secretary, recalls a saying of his about\r\n\"one of the saints,\" which actually appears in the first antiphon at\r\nMattins in the office of St. Malachy, and which Geoffrey applies to\r\nSt. Bernard himself: \"Blessed is he who loved the law, but did not\r\ndesire the chair [of dignity].\" (_V.P._ iii. 8).\r\n\r\n[384] On Malchus see p. 18, n. 6. He was now about eighty-five years\r\nof age.\r\n\r\n[385] Gillebertus (as St. Bernard writes the name) is a latinized form\r\nof the Irish _Gilla espuig_ (servant of the bishop), which is\r\nanglicized Gillespie. With that Irish name he subscribed the Acts of\r\nthe Synod of Rathbreasail (Keating, iii. 306); and we may therefore\r\naffirm with confidence that he was an Irishman. Gilbert was a friend\r\nof the famous thinker and ecclesiastical statesman, Anselm, who was\r\narchbishop of Canterbury from 1093 to 1109. The two men met each other\r\nfor the first time at Rouen, probably in 1087, when Anselm was called\r\nthither to the deathbed of William the Conqueror. Twenty years later,\r\nGilbert, then bishop of Limerick, wrote a letter of congratulation to\r\nAnselm on his victory over Henry I. in the controversy concerning\r\ninvestiture (August 1107). In his reply Anselm intimates that the long\r\ninterval had not blurred his recollection of their former\r\ncompanionship, from which we may infer that Gilbert's personality had\r\nmade a considerable impression upon him. Anselm also states that he\r\nhad learned (probably from the superscription of his friend's letter)\r\nthat he was now a bishop. It would seem, therefore, that Gilbert had\r\nbeen consecrated recently, and not, like the contemporary bishops of\r\nDanish sees in Ireland, by the English Primate (see the letters in\r\nUssher, 511, 512). He probably became bishop of Limerick about 1105.\r\nShortly after his correspondence with Anselm, and perhaps by his\r\ninfluence, he was appointed papal legate for Ireland, the first, as\r\nSt. Bernard tells us, who had held that office. He was legate when in\r\n1108 or 1109 he wrote his tract _De Statu Ecclesiæ_ (see above, p.\r\nxxx. ff.); and in 1110, as legate, he presided over the Synod of\r\nRathbreasail. In 1139 or 1140, being old and infirm, he resigned his\r\nlegatine commission and his see (§ 38 and p. 73, note 1). He died in\r\n1145. Gilbert was evidently a strong man, who had much influence on\r\nthe affairs of the Irish Church. It is therefore surprising that the\r\nonly reference to him in the native Annals is the notice of his death\r\nin the _Chronicon Scotorum_.\r\n\r\n[386] _Senior._ This is almost a technical word for the head of a\r\nreligious community. Malchus is called _ard senóir Gaoidheal_ (high\r\nsenior of the Irish) in _A.F.M._ 1135.\r\n\r\n[387] His dissimulation was his disregard of the divine call in the\r\nvision described in § 21.\r\n\r\n[388] Cp. _A.F.M._ 1132: \"Mael Maedoc Ua Morgair sat in the coarbate\r\nof Patrick _by the request of the clerics of Ireland_.\"\r\n\r\n[389] Ps. lxxxiii. 12 (vg.).--See Additional Note B, p. 165.\r\n\r\n[390] Gen. ix. 6.\r\n\r\n[391] The diocese of Connor.\r\n\r\n[392] Matt. xix. 2; Mark x. 2.\r\n\r\n[393] Ezek. xxxiii. 30.\r\n\r\n[394] Jer. l. 11.\r\n\r\n[395] The church of Armagh.\r\n\r\n[396] The \"spouse\" is primarily the diocese of Connor. His voluntary\r\npoverty is especially associated with his episcopate there in Serm. i.\r\n§ 6.\r\n\r\n[397] It can hardly be doubted that this means the diocese of Armagh\r\n(cp. p. 45, n. 4). Both § 19 and the title \"son of purity\" (_A.U._\r\n1129) imply that Cellach was not married.\r\n\r\n[398] Rom. ix. 19.\r\n\r\n[399] That Malachy was in 1132 recognized by many as coarb of Patrick\r\nis confirmed by the Annals (see p. 48, n. 3). But that he exercised\r\nhis episcopal office \"throughout the entire province\" is inconsistent\r\nwith the fact that in 1133 Murtough \"made a visitation of Tír Eoghain\r\n[counties of Derry and Tyrone] and received his tribute of cows and\r\nimparted his blessing\" (_A.F.M._).\r\n\r\n[400] September 17, 1134 (_A.F.M._). Sudden death is not suggested by\r\nthe Annals.\r\n\r\n[401] St. Bernard puns on the Latin name by which he represents Niall.\r\nIt is a diminutive of _niger_, black.\r\n\r\n[402] Josh. ix. 24 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[403] The meaning of this somewhat difficult sentence is made clear by\r\nthe reference to the Gibeonites (Josh. ix). By their stratagem they\r\n\"made provision for their lives,\" that is, that they should continue\r\nto live instead of being exterminated with the rest of the Canaanites.\r\nIn like manner Murtough provided that he should, as it were, live on\r\nand pursue his evil course, in the person of Niall.\r\n\r\n[404] He was Murtough's cousin, and Cellach's brother. See the table,\r\nAdditional Note B, p. 164.\r\n\r\n[405] That the king was either Conor O'Brien or Cormac Mac Carthy is\r\nhighly probable. To them Cellach had confided the duty of seeing that\r\nMalachy should be his successor (§ 19), and in this very year they\r\nreached the border of the diocese of Armagh (p. 43, n. 5). See p. 53,\r\nn. 5.\r\n\r\n[406] Ps. xxii. 16.\r\n\r\n[407] The narrative of this and the next section is illustrated by the\r\nAnnals under the year 1134. _A.F.M._, after recording the obit of\r\nMurtough, proceed: \"Niall, son of Aedh, was installed in the coarbate\r\nof Patrick. A change of abbots in Armagh, _i.e._ Mael Maedoc Ua\r\nMorgair in place of Niall.\" In _A.T._ we have the statement, \"Mael\r\nMaedog o Mongair ascended Patrick's chair. The Cinel Eoghain of Tulach\r\nÓg conspired against Mael Maedoc, and a flash of lightning consumed\r\ntwelve men of them on the spot where they conspired against him.\" Thus\r\nit seems that the conspirators came from the place now known as\r\nTullaghoge, in the county of Tyrone, then, as now, in the diocese of\r\nArmagh. It was the district inhabited by the sept of the O'Hagans, and\r\nin it was the _lía na rígh_, the inauguration chair of the O'Neills,\r\nkings of Ulster. The confirmation which St. Bernard's story receives\r\nfrom _A.T._ is the more important, because the two narratives are so\r\nfar different that they must have come from independent sources.\r\n\r\n[408] Ps. lii. 1 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[409] Cp.

The entry into the city of Armagh cannot\r\nhave taken place before October 1134, when Malachy was in his fortieth\r\n(possibly thirty-ninth) year. His entry into the province (§ 21) was\r\nprobably made in his thirty-eighth year. This was no doubt the cause\r\nof St. Bernard's error; for one of his documents may, like _A.F.M._\r\n(p. 48, n. 3), have used words which seemed to imply that he entered\r\nArmagh on that earlier occasion.\r\n\r\n[430] If \"the king\" was Cormac Mac Carthy (p. 51, n. 2), the statement\r\nthat he returned home shortly after Malachy obtained possession of the\r\nsee, is confirmed by _A.F.M._ For they record, under 1134, the\r\nconsecration of Cormac's Chapel on the rock of Cashel.\r\n\r\n[431] Wisd. iii. 1.\r\n\r\n[432] 2 Cor. vii. 5.\r\n\r\n[433] Ps. ii. 2; Acts iv. 26.\r\n\r\n[434] The flight of Niall seems clearly to imply that he was in the\r\ncity of Armagh. The natural inference is that \"having been driven out\"\r\nhe was afterwards reinstated. This may have happened while Malachy was\r\nabsent on a visitation of Munster, mentioned in _A.F.M._, but\r\napparently unknown to St. Bernard. The statement of the latter, that\r\nMalachy \"remained\" in Armagh, ignores it. See further, Additional Note\r\nC, p. 168 f.\r\n\r\n[435] The _Book of Armagh_, now in the Library of Trinity College,\r\nDublin. The manuscript was written at Armagh early in the ninth\r\ncentury by a scribe named Ferdomnach; but at an early date it came to\r\nbe supposed that it was the work of St. Patrick himself. From this\r\nbelief, perhaps, arose the name by which it was known for many\r\ncenturies, and which can be traced back to the year 936--the Canon of\r\nPatrick. It is strange that it should be called here a \"copy of the\r\nGospels\"; for in addition to the complete text of the New Testament it\r\ncontains two lives of St. Patrick, his _Confession_ and other\r\nhistorical documents. But the word _Gospel_ was very loosely used in\r\nIreland (see _R.I.A._ xxxiii. 327 f.). Misled by this description, de\r\nBacker (n. _ad loc._) identifies the book mentioned by St. Bernard\r\nwith the so-called \"Gospels of St. Patrick,\" found in the shrine known\r\nas the Domnach Airgid, about 1830, which have no connexion with Armagh\r\nor St. Patrick (_R.I.A. Trans._ xviii., \"Antiquities,\" pp. 14 ff.;\r\nxxx. 303 ff.; _R.I.A._ xxxiv. 108 ff.). For further information about\r\nthe _Book of Armagh_ the reader may consult Gwynn, especially pp.\r\nci.-cxvi.\r\n\r\n[436] The staff of Jesus was a wooden crozier (Giraldus, _Top._ iii.\r\n34), richly adorned. The story of its presentation by Christ to St.\r\nPatrick is found in the tenth-century _Trip._ (p. 30), no doubt taken\r\nfrom an earlier source. The staff was much older than the _Book of\r\nArmagh_; for we find that it was \"profaned\" in 789, and it was then\r\napparently regarded as the principal relic of St. Patrick (_A.U._\r\n788). It seems that there was a still more ancient tradition, that St.\r\nPatrick gave it to St. Mac Cairthinn (_R.I.A._ xxxiv. 114), from which\r\nit may be inferred that it once belonged to the church of Clogher. It\r\nwas removed from Armagh to Dublin in 1180, and deposited in Christ\r\nChurch. It was burnt in 1538 (_A.L.C._). Apparently St. Bernard is the\r\nonly authority for the statement that it was \"fashioned\" by Christ. It\r\nappears that the staff of Jesus, in the twelfth century, was regarded\r\nas a much more important relic than the _Book of Armagh_, and was more\r\nclosely associated with the person and office of the coarb of Patrick.\r\nIt is frequently mentioned in such a way as to suggest that it was one\r\nof the insignia of his authority (_A.U._ 1015, 1073, 1101, 1113, 1157,\r\n1166, 1167; _A.F.M._ 1135, 1139, 1143, 1148, 1152). Similar references\r\nto the _Book of Armagh_ do not occur till near the close of the\r\ntwelfth century, immediately after the removal of the staff from\r\nArmagh (_A.U._ 1179, 1196; Gwynn, p. civ.). A very full account of the\r\nlater history of the staff may be read in _O.C.C._ pp. viii-xx.\r\n\r\n[437] Deut. xxxii. 6.\r\n\r\n[438] _Gyrovagus._ The word is commonly used of a monk who leaves his\r\nproper monastery, and wanders about from one cell to another (see,\r\n_e.g._, St. Bernard, _Ep._ 68, § 4), or to a priest who deserts his\r\nparish (Du Cange, _s.v._).\r\n\r\n[439] Job i. 6, 7; ii. 2.\r\n\r\n[440] King (_Primacy of Armagh_, p. 97) thought that this was Conor\r\nO'Loughlin. But he could hardly be described as \"of the unrighteous\r\nrace,\" or as a \"prince,\" which would indicate a petty chieftain.\r\nProbably the conspirator was a local magnate.\r\n\r\n[441] Matt. xxvi. 4, combined with Luke xxii. 2.\r\n\r\n[442] Cp.

It is quite possible that the offer of peace was\r\nmade in good faith, and that Malachy and his friends were unduly\r\nsuspicious when they \"foresaw guile.\" The prince may have surrounded\r\nhimself with armed men as a mere matter of prudence.\r\n\r\n[460] Susanna, 62.\r\n\r\n[461] Luke xvi. 8.\r\n\r\n[462] § 23.\r\n\r\n[463] _Mulctatum in corpore._\r\n\r\n[464] _Mutatum in corde._\r\n\r\n[465] Ps. x. 2.\r\n\r\n[466] Jer. xvii. 7, etc.\r\n\r\n[467] _Plebes._\r\n\r\n[468] That is, the church of Armagh.\r\n\r\n[469] Hos. ii. 6.\r\n\r\n[470] Rom. xii. 3; xv. 15, etc.\r\n\r\n[471] This statement can hardly be regarded as accurate. Flann Ua\r\nSinaich, keeper of the staff of Jesus, having died, Malachy purchased\r\nit on July 7, 1135; or, in other words, as we may suppose, bribed the\r\nnew keeper to hand it over to him (_A.F.M._). Niall himself may have\r\nsubsequently surrendered the _Book of Armagh_.\r\n\r\n[472] 1 Tim. ii. 11.\r\n\r\n[473] Rom. xv. 13 (vg.).--The success of Malachy in establishing peace\r\nin the latter years of his rule at Armagh may be attributed in part to\r\nthe influence of a prince who is not mentioned in the text. Donough\r\nO'Carroll first appears in the Annals as chieftain of the men of\r\nFearnmaigh (now represented by the barony of Farney, co. Monaghan),\r\nwhom he led in an expedition against Fingal (the district north of\r\nDublin) in 1133. He seems to have succeeded to the kingdom or lordship\r\nof Oriel (which included the present counties of Armagh, Monaghan and\r\nLouth) on the death of Conor O'Loughlin (May 1136); for in 1138, \"with\r\nthe Oirgialla,\" he took part in an invasion of Meath. His career was\r\nprosperous till 1152, when he assaulted the coarb of Patrick\r\n(Gelasius). In consequence he was attacked by the Cenél Eoghain, and\r\nexpelled from Oriel. In 1155 he was imprisoned by Tighernan O'Rorke in\r\nLough Sheelan, for six weeks; but he escaped and recovered his\r\nkingdom, and was present at the consecration of the Church of\r\nMellifont Abbey in 1157. He was murdered in 1168. For his support of\r\nMalachy see Additional Note C, p. 170.\r\n\r\n[474] This is obviously not the king mentioned in §§ 22, 24, 25. The\r\nreference may be to Conor O'Loughlin, who was king of Oriel till he\r\nwas murdered in May 1136 (p. 40, note 2), or his successor, Donough\r\nO'Carroll.\r\n\r\n[475] Ecclus. xxi. 7.\r\n\r\n[476] Gal. ii. 11.\r\n\r\n[477] Exod. xvi. 20 (vg., inexact quotation).\r\n\r\n[478] Acts vi. 10 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[479] Isa. ii. 22; cf.

In the biblical passages in which the phrase occurs it\r\nindicates mortality. On the other hand, by the previous sentence St.\r\nBernard suggests that, in contrast to Malachy, the woman spoke under\r\nthe influence of an evil spirit.\r\n\r\n[480] Mark xiv. 61.\r\n\r\n[481] 2 Kings ii. 23.\r\n\r\n[482] _Memoria sanctorum._ Probably a reliquary. A reliquary preserved\r\nat Clogher in 1300 was known as the _membra_, which, according to one\r\nexplanation, was the equivalent of _memoriale scrinium_, memorial\r\nshrine. See _L.A.J._ iv. 245.

But the period of three years must be\r\nreckoned from the death of Murtough (September 17, 1134), or from the\r\nsubsequent ejection of Niall. Since stress is laid on the shortness,\r\nrather than the length of the period, we may therefore conclude that\r\npeace was established not long before October 1137, or, at any rate,\r\nafter the beginning of that year. And as St. Bernard believed that the\r\ninauguration of Gelasius \"immediately\" followed the resignation of\r\nMalachy, we may gather that both these events took place in 1137.\r\n_A.F.M._ date Malachy's resignation in 1136; but the chronology of St.\r\nBernard is to be preferred. See Additional Note C, pp. 168, 169.\r\n\r\n[491] Ps. xciv. 2.\r\n\r\n[492] Gelasius--in Irish Gilla meic Liag, the servant of the son of\r\nthe poet--was born about 1087. His father was apparently the poet of a\r\nTyrone sept, named Dermot (O'Hanlon, _Saints_, iii. 965). About 1121\r\nhe was appointed abbot of Derry, and held that office till he became\r\narchbishop of Armagh in 1137. He had a long episcopate and seems to\r\nhave been a vigorous prelate. His age and infirmity (says Giraldus)\r\nprevented him from attending the Synod of Cashel in 1172. But he\r\nsubsequently visited Henry II. in Dublin. Thither he brought the white\r\ncow, whose milk was his only food (Giraldus, _Expug._ i. 35). He died\r\nMarch 27, 1174, in his eighty-seventh year. For a Life of Gelasius,\r\nsee Colgan, _A.S.H._ p. 772.\r\n\r\n[493] See § 21.\r\n\r\n[494] _I.e._ diocese.\r\n\r\n[495] The two episcopal sees are evidently Connor and Down. But in\r\nearly time there were many more sees than two in that district (see\r\nReeves, p. 138), and there is no evidence that any one of them was the\r\nseat of a diocesan bishop. But, even if it were so, St. Bernard's\r\nstatement that the two supposed dioceses were \"welded into one\" by\r\nsome ambitious prelate prior to Malachy is unhistorical. A bishop of\r\nConnor and a bishop of Down both died in 1117, just seven years before\r\nMalachy became bishop of the diocese which included these two places;\r\nand there is no trace of a bishop in either of them in the interval.\r\nThe fact seems to be that the diocese of Connor or Down was\r\nconstituted for the first time at the Synod of Rathbreasail in 1110.\r\nIt remained on paper until Malachy was appointed its first bishop. For\r\nthe probable reason of Malachy's division of the diocese, see p. lvii.\r\nf.\r\n\r\n[496] This cannot be the true reason for Malachy's choice of Down\r\nrather than Connor. If he had wished to go to Connor on his retirement\r\nfrom Armagh he could have consecrated a bishop for Down. It is more\r\nprobable that his preference was due to his love for Bangor, where he\r\nresided during his first episcopate, and where he probably resided\r\nalso when he was bishop of Down. But, however that may be, Bangor was\r\nnecessarily under his jurisdiction as bishop of Down; his connexion\r\nwith it would have been severed if he had assumed the oversight of the\r\nnew diocese of Connor.\r\n\r\n[497] Isa. li. 9; Amos ix. 11.\r\n\r\n[498] Cp. Cant. i. 15; iv. i.; v. 12.--St. Bernard himself is said to\r\nhave had \"dove-like eyes\" (_V.P._ v. 12); and the meaning of the\r\nphrase is explained thus: \"In his eyes there shone a certain angelic\r\n_purity_ and a dove-like _simplicity_ (single-mindedness)\" (_ibid._\r\niii. 1).\r\n\r\n[499] Amos i. 13.\r\n\r\n[500] Cp. § 44, p. 83.\r\n\r\n[501] It has been commonly assumed that the house of this\r\nconvent--which obviously consisted of Augustinian canons (the only\r\norder of regular clerics recognized at this period by the Roman\r\nChurch: see Conc. Lat. 1139, can. 9, Mansi xxi. 528)--was in\r\nDownpatrick. It has accordingly been identified with a monastery which\r\nin the Terrier of 1615 is described as \"the monastery of the Irish,\r\nhard by the Cathedral,\" and called \"the church of the channons\"\r\n(Reeves, 43, 231). But it is not stated in the text to have been in\r\nDown. It seems more likely to have been the monastery of Bangor, which\r\nwas destroyed in 1127 (§ 18), and must have been reconstituted about\r\nthis time. There is no indication in the _Life_ that Malachy resided\r\nin Down, while there are several hints that Bangor was his\r\nheadquarters and that he was abbot of the community there as long as\r\nhe lived. (See p. 33, n. 1.) In other words Bangor was, in fact if not\r\nin name, the see of the diocese of Ulaid, or Down. For this curious\r\nanomaly we have a parallel in the diocese of Tír Eoghain, the see of\r\nwhich for a long period was at Maghera, the bishop, the while, being\r\noften styled bishop of Derry (_Irish Church Quarterly_, x. 225 ff.);\r\nand for the bishop of a diocese serving as abbot of his cathedral\r\nchapter of regular canons we may point to Carlisle (_Trans. of\r\nScottish Ecclesiological Society_, iii. 267 ff.), Louth (_L.A.J._ iv.\r\n143 ff.) and Christ Church, Dublin (_ibid._ 145). That the canons of\r\nBangor were at an early period the bishop's chapter we have\r\nindependent evidence. For in 1244 the Pope gave judgement in a cause\r\nwhich had been pending for some time between the prior and monks of\r\nDown and the abbot and canons of Bangor, each of whom claimed that\r\ntheir church was cathedral (Theiner, p. 42). This claim on behalf of\r\nBangor is easily explained if it was reckoned as the bishop's see in\r\nthe time of Malachy.\r\n\r\n[502] 2 Cor. x. 4.\r\n\r\n[503] Luke viii. 5.\r\n\r\n[504] Matt. xxi. 23; Mark xi. 28.\r\n\r\n[505] Acts viii. 6; John ii. 23.\r\n\r\n[506] 2 Cor. iii. 17.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\n_The Roman Pilgrimage: the Miracles which were wrought in it._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1139]\r\n\r\n33. (20). It seemed to him, however, that one could not go on doing\r\nthese things with sufficient security without the authority of the\r\nApostolic See; and for that reason he determined to set out for Rome,\r\nand most of all because the metropolitan see still lacked, and from the\r\nbeginning had lacked, the use of the pall, which is the fullness of\r\nhonour.[507] And it _seemed good in his eyes_[508] that the church for\r\nwhich he had laboured so much[509] should acquire, by his zeal and\r\nlabour, that privilege which hitherto it had not had. There was also\r\nanother metropolitan see, which Cellach had constituted anew, though\r\nsubject to the first see and to its archbishop as primate.[510] For it\r\nalso Malachy no less desired the pall, and that the prerogative which it\r\nhad attained by the gift of Cellach should be confirmed by the authority\r\nof the Apostolic See. When his purpose became known it displeased both\r\nthe brothers and the magnates and people of the country; because all\r\njudged that they could not endure so long an absence of the loving\r\nfather of them all, and because they feared he might die.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1139, June 12]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1140, January]\r\n\r\n34. It happened meanwhile that his brother, Christian by name,\r\ndied,[511] _a good man, full of grace and_ power.[512] He was a bishop\r\nsecond to Malachy in reputation, but in holiness of life and zeal for\r\nrighteousness perhaps his equal. His departure made all the more afraid,\r\nand rendered a parting from Malachy more grievous. They said, in fact,\r\nthat they would in no wise assent to the pilgrimage of their only\r\nprotector, since _the whole land_ would _be made desolate_[513] if in\r\none moment it was bereaved of two such _pillars_.[514] Therefore all,\r\nwith one voice, opposed him, and would have used force but that he\r\nthreatened them with divine vengeance. They refused to desist, however,\r\ntill the will of God on this matter should be asked by the casting of a\r\nlot. He forbade it: nevertheless they cast the lot, but thrice it was\r\nfound to give an answer in favour of Malachy. For they were not content\r\nwith one trial, so eager were they to retain him. Yielding at length\r\nthey let him go, but not without _lamentation and weeping and great\r\nmourning_.[515] But that he should leave nothing imperfect he began to\r\ntake measures by which he might _raise up the seed of his_ dead\r\n_brother_.[516] And three of his disciples having been summoned to him\r\nhe deliberated anxiously which should seem more worthy, or, in other\r\nwords, more useful, for this work. And when he had scrutinized them one\r\nby one, he said, \"Do you, Edan\" (that was the name of one of them),\r\n\"undertake the burden.\"[517] And when he hesitated and wept, he\r\nproceeded, \"Do not fear; for you have been designated to me by the Lord;\r\nfor just now I saw in anticipation the gold ring with which you are to\r\nbe espoused on your finger.\"[518] He assented, and when he had been\r\nconsecrated Malachy set out on his journey.\r\n\r\n35. And when he had left Scotland[519] and reached York, a priest,\r\nnamed Sycarus,[520] _steadfastly beholding him_[521] recognized him. For\r\nthough he had not seen his face before, because he _had the spirit of\r\nprophecy_[522] he had received a revelation concerning him long ago. And\r\nnow without hesitation he pointed him out with his finger to those who\r\nstood round him, saying, \"_This is he of whom I had said_ that from\r\nIreland _there shall come_[523] a holy bishop who _knoweth the thoughts\r\nof man_.\"[524] So the _lamp_ could not be hid _under a bushel_, for the\r\nHoly Spirit who _lighted_ it[525] brought it forth by the mouth of\r\nSycarus. For also many secret things concerning the affairs of him and\r\nhis companions were told him by Sycarus, all of which he acknowledged to\r\nbe or to have been. But when the companions of Malachy went on to\r\ninquire about their return, Sycarus immediately replied--and _the event\r\nafterwards proved the truth of the saying_[526]--that evidently very few\r\nof their number would return with the bishop. When they heard that they\r\nimagined that he apprehended death: but God fulfilled it in another way;\r\nfor on his way back from the City he left some with us, and some in\r\nother places, to learn the rule of life;[527] and so, _according to the\r\nword_ of Sycarus,[528] he returned to his own country with very few\r\ncompanions. So much concerning Sycarus.\r\n\r\n36. In the same city of York he was visited by a man of noble rank\r\naccording to the standard of the world, Waltheof[529] by name, then\r\nprior of the regular brothers at Kirkham,[530] but now a monk, and\r\nfather of the monks at Melrose, a monastery of our Order,[531] who\r\ndevoutly commended himself with humility to Malachy's prayers. And when\r\nhe noticed that the bishop had many companions and few horses--for\r\nbesides ministers[532] and other clerks he had with him five presbyters,\r\nand only three horses--he offered him his own, on which he rode, saying\r\nthat he regretted only one thing, that it was a pack-horse[533] and a\r\nrough animal to ride. And he added, \"I would have given it more\r\nwillingly if it had been better; but, if you think it worth while, take\r\nit with you, such as it is.\" \"And I,\" replied the bishop, \"accept it the\r\nmore willingly the more valueless you proclaim it, because nothing can\r\nbe of no value to me which so precious a will offers;\" and, turning to\r\nhis companions, \"Saddle this horse for me, for it is suitable for me,\r\nand will suffice for a long time.\" This done, he mounts. And at first he\r\nconsidered it rough, as it was, but afterwards, by a wonderful change,\r\nhe found that it suited him well and ambled pleasantly. And that there\r\nmight not _fall_ on _the ground_ any part of the word which he had\r\nspoken,[534] till the ninth year, the year in which he died,[535] it did\r\nnot fail him, and became an excellent and very valuable palfrey.\r\nAnd--that which made the miracle more evident to those that saw--from\r\nbeing nearly black it began to grow white, and after no long time[536]\r\nthere was scarcely a whiter horse to be found than it.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1140, March]\r\n\r\n37. (21). To me also it was granted to see the man on that journey,[537]\r\nand by the sight of him and by his word I was refreshed, and _I\r\nrejoiced as in all riches_;[538] and I, in turn, though a sinner, _found\r\ngrace in his sight_[539] then, and from that time up to his death, as I\r\nsaid in the Preface.[540] He also, deigning to turn aside to\r\nClairvaux,[541] when he saw the brothers was deeply moved; and they\r\nwere not a little edified by his presence and his speech. So accepting\r\nthe place and us, and gathering us into his inmost heart, he bade us\r\nfarewell and departed. And crossing the Alps he came to Ivrea,[542] a\r\ncity of Italy, where he immediately healed the little son of his host\r\nwho _was sick and ready to die_.[543]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1140, May]\r\n\r\n38. Pope Innocent II., of happy memory, was then in the Apostolic\r\nSee.[544] He received him courteously, and displayed kindly pity for him\r\non account of his long pilgrimage. And Malachy in the first place asked\r\nwith many tears for that which he had fixed most deeply in his heart,\r\nthat he might be allowed to live and die at Clairvaux, with the\r\npermission and blessing of the chief Pontiff. He sought this, not\r\nforgetful of the purpose for which he had come, but influenced by the\r\nlonging for Clairvaux which he had brought with him.[545] But he did not\r\nobtain his request, because the apostolic man decided that he should be\r\nemployed to more profitable advantage. He was not, however, wholly\r\ndisappointed of _his heart's desire_,[546] since it was granted him if\r\nnot to live, at least to die there. He spent a whole month in the City,\r\nvisiting the holy places and resorting to them for prayer. During that\r\ntime the chief Pontiff made frequent and careful inquiry of him and\r\nthose who were with him concerning the affairs of their country, the\r\nmorals of the people, the state of the churches, and the great things\r\nthat God had wrought by him in the land. And when he was already\r\npreparing to return home the Pope committed his own authority to him,\r\nappointing him legate throughout the whole of Ireland. For Bishop\r\nGilbert, who, as we have mentioned above, was then legate, had intimated\r\nto him that by reason of age and infirmity of body _he could no longer\r\ndischarge the duties of the office_.[547] After this Malachy prayed that\r\nthe constitution of the new metropolis[548] should be confirmed, and\r\nthat palls should be given him for both sees. The privilege of\r\nconfirmation he soon received; \"but regarding the palls,\" said the chief\r\nPontiff, \"more formal action must be taken. You must call together the\r\nbishops and clerks and the magnates of the land and hold a general\r\ncouncil; and so with the assent and common desire of all ye shall demand\r\nthe pall by persons of honest repute, and it shall be given you.\" Then\r\nhe took his mitre from his own head, and placed it on Malachy's\r\nhead,[549] and more, he gave him the stole and maniple which he was\r\naccustomed to use in the offering; and saluting him with the kiss of\r\npeace he dismissed him, strengthened with the apostolic blessing and\r\nauthority.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1140, July-August]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1142]\r\n\r\n39. And returning by Clairvaux he bestowed on us _a second_\r\nbenediction.[550] And sighing deeply that it was not allowed him to\r\nremain as he longed to do, he said, \"Meanwhile I pray you to keep these\r\nmen for me, that they may learn from you what they may afterwards teach\r\nus.\" And he added, \"They will be to us for a seed, _and in_ this _seed\r\nshall the nations be blessed_,[551] even those nations which from\r\nancient days have heard the name of monk, but have not seen a\r\nmonk.\"[552] And leaving four of his most intimate companions[553] he\r\ndeparted: and they, when they were proved and found worthy, were made\r\nmonks. After a time, when the saint was now in his own country, he sent\r\nothers,[554] and they were dealt with in like manner. And when they had\r\nbeen instructed for some time _and had applied their hearts unto\r\nwisdom_,[555] the holy brother Christian,[556] who was one of\r\nthemselves, was given to them to be their father, and we sent them out,\r\nadding from our own a sufficient number for an abbey.[557] And this\r\nabbey _conceived and bare_ five _daughters_,[558] and the seed being\r\nthus multiplied[559] the number of monks increases from day to day\r\naccording to the desire and prophecy of Malachy. Now let us return to\r\nthe order of the narrative.\r\n\r\n40. (22). Malachy having set out from us had a prosperous journey\r\nthrough Scotland. And he found King David,[560] who is still alive\r\nto-day, in one of his castles;[561] and his son _was sick nigh unto\r\ndeath_.[562] And when Malachy entered the king's house he was honourably\r\nreceived by him and prevailed upon by humble entreaty _that he would\r\nheal his son_.[563] He sprinkled the youth with water which he had\r\nblessed, and _fastening his eyes upon him_ said,[564] \"Trust me, my son;\r\nyou shall not die this time.\" He said this, and on the next day,\r\naccording to his word, there followed the cure, and after the cure the\r\njoy of the father and the shouting and noise of the whole exulting\r\nfamily. The _rumour went forth_[565] to all, for what happened in the\r\nroyal house and to the king's son _could not be hid_.[566] And lo,\r\neverywhere there resounded _thanksgiving and the voice of praise_,[567]\r\nboth for the salvation of their lord, and for the novelty of the\r\nmiracle. This is Henry;[568] for he still lives, the only son of his\r\nfather, a brave and prudent knight, taking after his father as they say,\r\nin _following after righteousness_[569] and love of the truth. And both\r\nloved Malachy, as long as he lived, because he had recalled him from\r\ndeath. They asked him to remain some days; but he, shunning renown, was\r\nimpatient of delay, and in the morning went on his way.\r\n\r\nAs he passed, therefore, through the village called Cruggleton,[570] a\r\ndumb girl met him. While he prayed _the string of her tongue was loosed\r\nand she spake plain_.[571]\r\n\r\nThen he entered the village which they call St. Michael's Church,[572]\r\nand before all the people cured a woman who was brought to him, mad and\r\nbound with cords; and when he had sent her away restored he went on.\r\n\r\nBut when he came to Portus Lapasperi,[573] he waited there for a passage\r\nsome days; but the time of delay did not pass idly. In the interval an\r\noratory is constructed of twigs woven into a hedge, he both giving\r\ndirections and himself working. When it was finished he surrounded it\r\nwith a wall, and blessed the enclosed space for a cemetery. The merits\r\nof him who blessed, the miracles, which are said to be wrought there\r\nfrequently to this day, sufficiently declare.\r\n\r\n41. Hence it came that they were in the habit of carrying thither from\r\nthe neighbouring places those _that were_ infirm and _diseased_, and\r\n_many_ were healed.[574] A woman paralysed in all her limbs, brought\r\nthither on a waggon, returned home on foot, having waited only one night\r\nin the holy place, not in vain, for the mercy of the Lord.[575]\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLet these incidents--a few out of many--suffice with reference to that\r\nplace; for now we must proceed with what remains.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[507] The pall is a sort of collar, made of lamb's wool, which every\r\nmetropolitan is required to obtain from the Pope, and without which he\r\ncannot exercise his functions. From the end of the eleventh century it\r\nhas been described in papal bulls as the symbol of \"the fullness of\r\nthe pontifical office\" (_Catholic Encyclopedia_, xi. 428). For the\r\ndate of Malachy's decision to go to Rome, see p. 72, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[508] 1 Sam. xiv. 36, 40 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[509] Armagh.\r\n\r\n[510] Cashel, the seat of the kings of Munster. It was certainly the\r\nsee of an archbishop in 1110, when Malchus subscribed the Acts of\r\nRathbreasail as archbishop of Cashel. For the date of its foundation\r\nsee p. xxxv. f.\r\n\r\n[511] Christian, bishop of Clogher, was probably appointed bishop of\r\nthat diocese in succession to Cinaeth Ua Baigill, who died in 1135\r\n(_A.T._). He seems to have transferred the see of the diocese to\r\nLouth, a large part of the diocese of Armagh (in which Louth was\r\nsituated) being placed under his jurisdiction. This arrangement was no\r\ndoubt made by Malachy with the support of Donough O'Carroll. See the\r\ndocument quoted in Additional Note C, p. 170, _L.A.J._ iv. 133 ff. and\r\nabove, p. lix. Christian is commemorated in the contemporary\r\nMartyrology of Gorman on June 12. The year of his death is stated\r\n(_A.F.M._) to have been 1138. St. Bernard obviously supposed it to\r\nhave taken place in 1139 (p. 70, n. 2), and he appears to be right.\r\nFor the work described in § 32 demands a longer period than can be\r\nallowed for it on the supposition that he divulged his scheme of\r\nvisiting Rome before June 12, 1138. Moreover by that time he cannot\r\nhave known that the papal schism had come to an end; for the Anti-pope\r\ndid not submit till May 29. Cp. p. 72, n. 3, and _R.I.A._ xxxv. 245\r\nff. For another notice of Christian, see p. 89, n. 1.\r\n\r\n[512] Acts vi. 8 (vg.), combined with Acts xi. 24.\r\n\r\n[513] Jer. xii. 11.\r\n\r\n[514] Gal. ii. 9.\r\n\r\n[515] Matt. ii. 18.\r\n\r\n[516] Deut. xxv. 5 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[517] Edan O'Kelly was bishop of Louth till his death in 1182\r\n(_A.L.C._). He organized the diocese of Oriel, with its see at\r\nLouth--corresponding to the present diocese of Clogher--by the help of\r\nDonough O'Carroll. In conjunction with him he founded the monastery of\r\nSS. Peter and Paul for Augustinian canons at Knock, by Louth,\r\nconsecrated by Malachy in 1148 (_A.F.M._; _L.A.J._ iv. 239, and\r\ndocument quoted, p. 170). Close to it he also founded the Augustinian\r\nmonastery of St. Mary, the church of which was the cathedral church of\r\nthe diocese. On the early history of this diocese see _L.A.J._ iv. 129\r\nff.\r\n\r\n[518] This simple story was much developed in later times. Thus in a\r\nmedieval register of Clogher we read that when Edan had anointed\r\nChristian on his deathbed \"Malachy saw the ring which Christian wore\r\nleap to Edan's finger, and therefore he consecrated him bishop\"\r\n(_L.A.J._ iv. 239).\r\n\r\n[519] No particulars are given of the passage through Scotland. But\r\nMalachy probably sailed from Bangor to Cairngarroch (§ 40, p. 78, n.\r\n4), and travelled thence by the shortest route through Carlisle to\r\nYork. The kingdom of Scotland then extended southwards to the river\r\nRibble at Gisburn (§ 69) and eastwards to the Tees (William of\r\nNewburgh, in _Chron. of Stephen_ (R.S.), i. 70). For a full discussion\r\nof his journeys, the results of which are here assumed, see _R.I.A._\r\nxxxv. 238-243.\r\n\r\n[520] This probably represents the Saxon name Sighere. Jocelin, who\r\ntells this story (_Vita S. Waltheni_ in _AA.SS._, Aug., i. 255), says\r\nthat Sycarus (or as the MSS. of his tract call him, Figarus) was a\r\npriest _de Neubato_ (v.l. _Neuvelt_). _i.e._, I suppose, of Newbald, a\r\nparish near Market Weighton, and about twenty-three miles from York.\r\n\r\n[521] Acts xiv. 9.\r\n\r\n[522] Rev. xix. 10.\r\n\r\n[523] John i. 30.\r\n\r\n[524] Ps. xciv. 11.\r\n\r\n[525] Matt. v. 15; Mark iv. 21; Luke xi. 33.\r\n\r\n[526] Gen. xli. 13 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[527] Cp. § 39.\r\n\r\n[528] 2 Kings vi. 18, etc.\r\n\r\n[529] Printed text, _Wallenus_, obviously an error for _Walleuus_\r\n(_Wallevus_), which is the reading of A. The name occurs also in the\r\nform Waldeve. St. Waltheof was the younger son of Simon de St. Liz,\r\nearl of Northampton, by his wife Matilda, daughter of Waltheof, earl\r\nof Northumberland. After Simon's death Matilda married David,\r\nafterwards (1124) king of Scots. That Waltheof was the stepson of\r\nDavid I. is a fact not unimportant for readers of the _Life of St.\r\nMalachy_. After living for some time in Scotland Waltheof retired to\r\nthe Augustinian priory of St. Oswald, Nostal. Subsequently, but at\r\nwhat date seems to be unknown, he was appointed prior of Kirkham. But,\r\ndesirous of a more austere life, he resigned the priory, and entered a\r\nCistercian house at Wardon, Bedfordshire. From it he soon migrated to\r\nRievaulx in Yorkshire, and took the vows of the Order. On the\r\ndeposition of Richard, first abbot of Melrose, he was elected as his\r\nsuccessor in 1148. He died August 3, 1159. (Life by Jocelin in\r\n_AA.SS._, Aug, i. 248). His visit to Malachy proves that the fame of\r\nthe latter had come to his ears--probably through the Scots who knew\r\nhim at Lismore (§ 8). It indicates also that Malachy stayed at York\r\nlong enough to allow the news of his arrival to be sent to Kirkham.\r\n\r\n[530] The ruins of Kirkham Abbey remain in the parish of Weston, about\r\nsixteen miles north-east of York. This house of Augustinian canons was\r\nfounded in 1121 by Walter Espec and his wife Adeline. The first prior\r\nwas William, rector of Garton, uncle of Espec. Dugdale (vol. vi. 1.\r\npp. 207-209), overlooking Waltheof, mentions no other before 1190.\r\n\r\n[531] The first Cistercian monastery in Scotland, founded in 1136 by\r\nDavid I. It was a daughter of Rievaulx, from which, as we have seen,\r\nWaltheof was called to be its abbot. Its church of St. Mary was\r\nconsecrated July 28, 1146. It is on the bank of the Tweed, not far\r\nfrom Old Melrose, the site of a community founded in the seventh\r\ncentury, of which St. Cuthbert was a member. See James A. Wade,\r\n_History of Melrose_.\r\n\r\n[532] Deacons.\r\n\r\n[533] _Runcinus_, the Old English _rouncy_ (Chaucer, _Prol._ 390).\r\nFrom this incident the inference is clear that during the whole\r\njourney to Rome and back most of Malachy's companions were always on\r\nfoot, and that the party went at a walking pace.\r\n\r\n[534] 1 Sam. iii. 19. Cp. Matt. x. 29.\r\n\r\n[535] An important date. Since Malachy died on November 2, 1148, he\r\nmust have reached York not earlier than November 1139. For reasons for\r\nputting the visit somewhat later see _R.I.A._, xxxv. 247 f.\r\n\r\n[536] \"Within a few days,\" says Jocelin in his version of the story!\r\nSee _AA.SS._ l.c.\r\n\r\n[537] After leaving York Malachy no doubt followed approximately the\r\nline of the Roman road known as Erming Street to London and\r\nCanterbury. Thanks to the preservation of the Itinerary of Archbishop\r\nSigeric on his journey from Rome to Canterbury in 990 (Stubbs,\r\n_Memorials of St. Dunstan_ (R.S.), pp. 391-395), to our knowledge of\r\nthe routes of travellers contemporary with Malachy, and to the rare\r\nmention in the _Life_ of places through which he passed, we can follow\r\nhim almost step by step from Canterbury to Rome and back. He probably\r\nsailed from Dover, and landed on the French coast at or near Wissant.\r\nThence he went by Arras, Rheims, Châlons-sur-Marne, Bar-sur-Aube,\r\nLausanne, Martigny, and over the Great St. Bernard to Ivrea. Then he\r\nfollowed the beaten tract through Vercelli, Pavia, Piacenza,\r\nPontremoli, Lucca and Viterbo to Rome. On the whole journey, from\r\nBangor to Rome and back, the company traversed about 3000 miles on\r\nland, besides crossing the sea four times. Allowing for stoppages at\r\nRome, Clairvaux and elsewhere, and for a weekly rest on Sunday,\r\nMalachy must have been absent from Ireland about nine months. For\r\ndetails see _R.I.A._ xxxv. 238 ff. The marginal dates are based on\r\nthat investigation, and are to be regarded merely as approximations.\r\n\r\n[538] Ps. cxix. 14.\r\n\r\n[539] Gen. xxxiii. 10, etc.\r\n\r\n[540] Pref. § 2.\r\n\r\n[541] Malachy probably \"turned aside\" from the main road at\r\nBar-sur-Aube, from which Clairvaux is distant eight miles. A few words\r\nmay be said about this famous monastery and its first abbot. Bernard,\r\nthe son of a nobleman named Tescelin and his saintly wife Aleth, whose\r\nmemory exercised a powerful influence on the lives of her children,\r\nwas born at Fontaines, a mile or two from Dijon, in 1090. In Oct. 1111\r\nhe persuaded his brothers and many of his friends to embrace the\r\nreligious life. Early in the following year the whole band, thirty in\r\nnumber, entered the austere and now declining community which had been\r\nestablished in 1098 at Citeaux, twelve miles from Dijon. Their arrival\r\nwas the beginning of the prosperity of the great Cistercian Order. In\r\n1115 Bernard was sent out, with some brothers, by the abbot, Stephen\r\nHarding, to found a daughter house on the river Aube, in a valley\r\nwhich had once been known, from its desolation, as the Valley of\r\nWormwood. After incredible hardships a monastery was built, and the\r\nplace was so transformed by the labours of the monks that henceforth\r\nit deserved its newer name of Clara Vallis, or Clairvaux. The\r\ncommunity rapidly increased in numbers; and in 1133, in spite of the\r\nopposition of the abbot when the proposal was first made, the building\r\nof a large monastery on a different site was begun. It was probably\r\nfar advanced when Malachy arrived in 1140 (Vacandard, i. 413, 423). It\r\nwas just completed when he came again in 1148 (see p. 143, n. 5). St.\r\nBernard died on August 20, 1153. At this time he was the most powerful\r\necclesiastic in Europe, not excepting his nominee Pope Innocent II.\r\n(see p. 72, n. 3). Doubtless the main purpose of Malachy's visit to\r\nClairvaux was to secure St. Bernard's support of the petition which he\r\nwas about to present to the Pope. For further information about St.\r\nBernard the reader may consult _V.P._, Vacandard, J. Cotter Morison,\r\n_The Life and Times of St. Bernard, Abbot of Clairvaux_ (1868), and\r\nRichard S. Storrs, _Bernard of Clairvaux, the Times, the Man, and his\r\nWork_ (1892).\r\n\r\n[542] _Yporia._ Its ancient name was Eporedia. From it there are two\r\nroutes across the Alps, by the Great St. Bernard and the Little St.\r\nBernard respectively.\r\n\r\n[543] Luke vii. 2.\r\n\r\n[544] On the death of Pope Honorius II. (February 14, 1130) two Popes\r\nwere elected by different groups of cardinals, Innocent II. and\r\nAnacletus II. St. Bernard espoused the cause of the former, and by his\r\nuntiring efforts almost all the sovereigns of Europe were enlisted on\r\nhis side (see Vacandard, chaps. x.-xiii., xviii.; Storrs, pp. 523-540;\r\nMorison, pp. 149-165, 209-213). But the schism lasted for eight years.\r\nAt length Anacletus died (January 7, 1138), and the surrender of his\r\nsuccessor, Victor IV., on May 29, 1138 (_Ep._ 317), left Innocent in\r\nundisputed occupation of the papal chair. The news of the pacification\r\nwas not announced in Scotland till the end of September (Richard of\r\nHexham, 170). It probably reached Ireland a little later. It must have\r\nbeen after he was assured of the end of the schism that Malachy\r\nproposed his journey to Rome, _i.e._ at the end of 1138 or in 1139.\r\n\r\n[545] _Quo uenerat._\r\n\r\n[546] Ps. xxi. 2.\r\n\r\n[547] Luke xvi. 2 (vg.).--For Gilbert see p. 47, n. 3. Patrick,\r\nsuccessor of Gilbert in the see of Limerick, was consecrated by\r\nTheobald, archbishop of Canterbury, who was himself consecrated on\r\nJanuary 8, 1139 (W. Stubbs, _Reg. Sac. Angl._, p. 45). His profession\r\nof obedience (Ussher, p. 565) appears in the roll of professions at\r\nCanterbury immediately before that of Uhtred of Llandaff, who was\r\nconsecrated in 1140 (Stubbs, _l.c._). If we assume that Gilbert\r\nresigned his see and his legatine commission at the same time, this\r\ngives 1139-40 as the date of Malachy's journey, in agreement with the\r\nhint of St. Bernard in § 36. It is possible that Gilbert's resignation\r\nof his office as legate was sent to Rome by Malachy.\r\n\r\n[548] Cashel. See p. 65, note 4.\r\n\r\n[549] Fleming in 1623 saw a mitre of Malachy at Clairvaux, which was\r\nsupposed to have been the one placed on his head by Innocent at\r\nOrbiers, ten leagues away, his wooden drinking cup was preserved: it\r\nwas in a leathern case, adorned with Irish interlacings (_Irish\r\nEcclesiastical Record_, vii. 63).\r\n\r\n[550] Cp. 2 Cor. i. 15.\r\n\r\n[551] Gen. xxii. 18; xxvi. 4.\r\n\r\n[552] Compare the passage concerning a brother who had been sent from\r\nClairvaux to Sweden in 1143, and had founded a daughter monastery\r\nthere: \"The lord [St. Bernard] sent to his faithful servant learned\r\nand discreet persons from the parts of Germany and England, by whom\r\nthe discipline of monastic religion founded in that kingdom increased\r\nand bore worthy fruit among peoples who had indeed heard the name of\r\nmonk, but had never before seen a monk\" (_V.P._ vii. 54). It was\r\nliterally true that no monastic communities had previously existed in\r\nSweden (C. H. Robinson, _Conversion of Europe_, p. 482 f. Cp.\r\nVacandard, ii. 416). But the passage before us cannot be construed as\r\nan assertion that Ireland was in like case; for in § 12 mention is\r\nmade of the \"monks\" of Bangor in the time of Congall. St. Bernard (or\r\nMalachy, if the words are really his) must be taken to mean simply\r\nthat the so-called monks of the decadent contemporary Church of\r\nIreland were not monks in the true sense of the word. (Cp. Lett. iii.\r\n§ 2). There is nothing to be said for the explanation suggested by\r\nLanigan (iv. 114) that the \"nations\" are nations other than the Irish,\r\nwho had no monks. For where were those nations to whom the Irish might\r\nsend colonies of monks? The fact is that the Latin word for \"nations\"\r\n(_gentes_) may quite well mean here what it certainly means in § 42,\r\nthe Irish tribes.\r\n\r\n[553] He left others in other Cistercian houses (§ 35).\r\n\r\n[554] Cp. Letter i. § 1.\r\n\r\n[555] Ps. xc. 12.\r\n\r\n[556] Gilla Críst Ua Condoirche was probably a native of the district\r\nof Bangor (§ 14). He seems to have been one of the four who were left\r\nby Malachy at Clairvaux; and, as is here stated, he was the first\r\nabbot of Mellifont. He seems, however, to have proved not well suited\r\nfor the office, for he was sent back to Clairvaux for further\r\ninstruction (Letter iii. § 3). Some of the Clairvaux brothers (if not\r\nall of them) refused to remain in Ireland, and it is perhaps hinted\r\nthat the cause of their return was dissatisfaction with his\r\nadministration (_ib._ § 2). About 1150 he was promoted to the\r\nbishopric of Lismore, and at the Synod of Kells in 1152 he appeared as\r\npapal legate (Keating, iii. 317). He was present at the consecration\r\nof the church of Mellifont Abbey in 1157 (_A.U._) As legate he also\r\npresided at the Synod of Cashel in 1172 (Giraldus, _Expug._ i. 34). He\r\ndied in 1186 (_A.L.C._). Felix, bishop of Lismore, attended the\r\nLateran Council of 1179 (Mansi, xxii. 217). Christian must therefore\r\nhave resigned his see before that date.\r\n\r\n[557] Mellifont Abbey, the ruins of which still remain in a secluded\r\nvalley, beside the stream known as the Mattock, about two miles from\r\nthe Boyne, and five miles west of Drogheda. Some time after Malachy\r\nreturned to Ireland he wrote to St. Bernard, asking him to send two of\r\nthe four brothers who had been left at Clairvaux to select a site for\r\nthe abbey. This request was declined (Lett. i. § 1), and the\r\nsite--doubtless the gift of Donough O'Carroll (see the document quoted\r\np. 170)--was apparently chosen by Malachy himself. In 1142 (_C.M.A._\r\nii. 262, _Clyn's Annals_, _Annals of Boyle_), the four brothers,\r\ntogether with a contingent of monks from Clairvaux, arrived, and the\r\nmonastery was founded, with Christian as its first abbot (Lett. ii.).\r\nConsiderable progress was made with the buildings, and endowments\r\npoured in. But after a while it became necessary to send Christian\r\nback to France for further instruction, and the Clairvaux monks went\r\nwith him, never to return. In due time Christian resumed his office as\r\nabbot, and with him came one Robert, to assist him in the work of\r\nbuilding and organization (Lett. iii). The Abbey Church was not\r\nconsecrated till 1157, nine years after Malachy's death (_A.U._).\r\nMellifont remained the principal Cistercian house in Ireland up to the\r\nReformation. After the dissolution (1539) it was granted, with its\r\npossessions, to Sir Edward Moore, ancestor of the earls of Drogheda.\r\nThe only portions of the monastery which remain in a fair state of\r\npreservation are the Chapter House and the Lavabo. The latter belongs\r\nto the original building. Excavations made about twenty years ago\r\nrevealed the ground plan of the entire monastery, most of which was of\r\nlater date than Malachy. Traces were discovered of the foundation of\r\nthe eastern portion of the original church, about forty feet west of\r\nthe east wall of the structure which later took its place. It had six\r\nchapels at the east end, four of which were apsidal (_71st Report of\r\nCommissioners of Public Works, Ireland_, p. 11).\r\n\r\n[558] 1 Sam. ii. 21.--The five daughters were apparently Bective (de\r\nBeatitudine) founded in 1147, Boyle, 1147-8, Monasternenagh, 1148,\r\nBaltinglas (de Valle Salutis), 1148, and Inislounaght (Janauschek,\r\n_Origines Cistercienses_, Vindoboniæ, 1877, pp. 70, 92, 113). The\r\nlast-named seems to have been in existence in 1148 (see § 64), and it\r\nmay have been an off-shoot of Mellifont, though at an early date it\r\nwas subject to Monasternenagh (_ibid._ 131). Gougaud (_Les Chrétientés\r\nCeltiques_, 1911, p. 364) gives Shrule (de Benedictione Dei) the fifth\r\nplace; but it appears to have been founded (1150?) after the _Life_\r\nwas written (Janauschek, p. 114).\r\n\r\n[559] Cp. Gen. xxii. 17; xxvi. 4.\r\n\r\n[560] David I. of Scotland, son of Malcolm Canmore and St. Margaret,\r\nthe sister of Edgar the Atheling. He was born in 1084. His sister\r\nMatilda was the wife of Henry I. of England; and thus he was uncle of\r\nMatilda, the empress, for whom he fought against Stephen, though\r\nStephen's wife, Queen Matilda, was also his niece. In 1113 David\r\nmarried Matilda, the widow of Simon de St. Liz, earl of Northampton\r\n(cp. p. 69, n. 1). He succeeded Alexander I. in 1124 and died in 1153.\r\nAs the founder of several Scottish dioceses and as having introduced\r\nthe Cistercian Order into his kingdom he had much in common with St.\r\nMalachy.\r\n\r\n[561] This is probably an error. There is no record that David I. had\r\nany castles in Galloway; and the chronicles seem to show that at this\r\nperiod his principal residences were at Roxburgh and Carlisle. The\r\nnarrative suggests that the castle referred to was in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of Cruggleton (p. 78, n. 1), and it was probably the\r\npredecessor of that of which the scanty ruins--believed to be of\r\nthirteenth-century date--remain on the coast not far from the village.\r\nThey are on a peninsula of such natural strength that we may suppose\r\nit was in very early times the site of a fortress (_Fourth Report of\r\nCommission on Ancient Monuments in Scotland_, vol. i. p. 144).\r\nPossibly, as has been suggested, David was there as the guest of\r\nFergus, lord of Galloway (1124-1161), to whom, subsequently to the\r\nBattle of the Standard (August 22, 1138), and probably not long before\r\nthis visit of Malachy, he had been reconciled after a long\r\nestrangement (Agnew, _Hereditary Sheriffs of Galloway_, 1893. vol. i.\r\np. 58).\r\n\r\n[562] Phil. ii. 27 (inexact quotation).\r\n\r\n[563] 2 John iv. 47.\r\n\r\n[564] Acts iii. 4.\r\n\r\n[565] Luke vii. 17.\r\n\r\n[566] Mark vii. 24.\r\n\r\n[567] Isa. li. 3 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[568] The only son of David: \"a man gentle and pious, a man of sweet\r\nnature and of pure heart, and worthy in all things to be born of such\r\na father\" (Ailred of Rievaulx, in A. O. Anderson, _Scottish Annals\r\nfrom English Chroniclers_, p. 156). He died before his father, in May\r\nor June 1152 (John of Hexham). Two of his sons became kings of Scots,\r\nMalcolm IV. and William I.\r\n\r\n[569] Rom. ix. 30, etc.\r\n\r\n[570] _Crugeldum._ Cruggleton is on the west coast of Wigtown Bay, in\r\nthe parish of Sorby, Wigtownshire. In passing through this village\r\nMalachy made a détour, probably in order to visit King David, which\r\nconsiderably lengthened his journey.\r\n\r\n[571] Mark vii. 35.\r\n\r\n[572] The parish church of Mochrum, Wigtownshire, as Sir Herbert\r\nMaxwell informs me, was anciently dedicated to St. Michael. Thus the\r\nvillage called St. Michael's Church is undoubtedly Kirk Mochrum, which\r\nclusters round the church, and through which every traveller from\r\nCruggleton to Cairngarroch (see next note) must pass. It is twelve\r\nmiles from Cruggleton.\r\n\r\n[573] _Lapasperi_ is obviously the gen. of _Lapasper_, a corruption of\r\n_Lapis asper_ (rough stone). This seems to be a Latin rendering of\r\nCairngarroch (= _Carn garbh_), a name which occurs three times on the\r\nshores of Wigtownshire. One of the places so called, on the west coast\r\nof Luce Bay, may be set aside. The other two are seven or eight miles\r\napart, within sight of the Bangor coast, and nearly equidistant from\r\nit; one in the parish of Stoneykirk, the other (now known as Rough\r\nCairn) in the parish of Geswalt. The late Sir Andrew Agnew (_op. cit._\r\np. 59) regarded the latter as the place referred to in the text on\r\ngrounds which do not seem conclusive. Cairngarroch in Stoneykirk is to\r\nbe preferred for two reasons: it is more easily approached from inland\r\nthan its rival; and it has impressed its name on the actual\r\ncoast-line, which the other has not done; \"Cairngarroch Bay\" is\r\nequivalent to _Port Cairn garbh_, and that to the _Portus Lapasperi_\r\nof the text. This identification was first proposed by O'Hanlon (p.\r\n81); and its probability is increased now that the position of St.\r\nMichael's Church has been fixed (see preceding note). But one of his\r\narguments in favour of it, based on the name of the parish, is\r\nfallacious; for \"Stoneykirk\" has nothing to do with stones: it is a\r\nlate corruption of Steiniekirk = St. Stephen's Church.\r\n\r\n[574] Mark i. 32, 34.\r\n\r\n[575] For the passage here omitted see Appendix, p. 171.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n_St. Malachy's Apostolic Labours, Praises and Miracles._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1140, October]\r\n\r\n42. (23). Malachy embarked in a ship, and after a prosperous voyage\r\nlanded at his monastery of Bangor,[576] so that his first sons might\r\nreceive the first _benefit_.[577] In what state of mind do you suppose\r\nthey were when they received their father--and such a father--in good\r\nhealth from so long a journey? No wonder if their whole heart gave\r\nitself over to joy at his return, when swift rumour soon brought\r\nincredible gladness even to the tribes[578] outside round about them. In\r\nfine, from the cities and castles and hamlets they ran to meet him, and\r\nwherever he turned he was received with _the joy of the whole\r\nland_.[579] But honour is not to his taste. He exercises his office as\r\nlegate; many assemblies are held in many places, so that no region, or\r\npart of a region, may be defrauded of the fruit and advantage of his\r\nlegation. He _sows beside all waters_;[580] there is not one who can\r\nescape from his sedulous care. Neither sex, nor age, nor condition, nor\r\n[religious] profession is held in account.[581] Everywhere the saving\r\nseed is scattered, everywhere the heavenly trumpet sounds. He scours\r\nevery place, everywhere he breaks in, with _the sword_ of his tongue\r\nunsheathed _to execute vengeance upon the nations and punishments upon\r\nthe peoples_.[582] The terror of him is _on them that do evil_.[583] He\r\ncries _unto the unrighteous, deal not unrighteously, and to the wicked,\r\nlift not up the horn_.[584] Religion is planted everywhere, is\r\npropagated, is tended. His _eyes are upon_ them,[585] his care is for\r\ntheir necessities. In councils, which are everywhere held, the ancient\r\ntraditions are revived, which, though their excellence was undisputed,\r\nhad fallen into disuse by the negligence of the priests. And not only\r\nare the old restored, new customs are also devised; and whatsoever\r\nthings he promulgated are accepted as though issued from heaven, are\r\nheld fast, are committed to writing for a memorial to posterity. Why\r\nshould we not believe those things were sent from heaven which so many\r\nheavenly miracles confirm? And that I may make what has been said\r\ncredible, let me touch on some of these miracles in a few words. For who\r\ncan enumerate all? Though I confess I had rather dwell on those things\r\nwhich can be imitated than on those which can only excite wonder.\r\n\r\n43. (24). And in my judgement the first and greatest miracle that he\r\nexhibited was himself.[586] For to say nothing of his _inner man_,[587]\r\nthe beauty and strength and purity of which his habits and life\r\nsufficiently attested, he so bore himself even outwardly in a uniform\r\nand consistent manner, and that the most modest and becoming, that\r\nabsolutely nothing appeared in him which could offend the beholders.\r\nAnd, indeed, _he who offends not in word, the same is a perfect\r\nman_.[588] But yet in Malachy, who, though he observed with unusual\r\ncare, ever detected, I will not say an _idle word_,[589] but an idle\r\nnod? Who ever knew his hand or his foot to move without purpose? Yea,\r\nwhat was there that was not edifying in his gait, his mien, his bearing,\r\nhis countenance? In fine, neither did sadness darken nor laughter turn\r\nto levity the joyousness of his countenance.[590] Everything in him was\r\nunder _discipline_, everything a mark _of virtue_, _a rule_[591] of\r\nperfection. Always he was grave, but not austere. Relaxing at times, but\r\nnever careless; neglecting nothing, though for a time ignoring many\r\nthings. Quiet often, but by no means at any time idle.[592] From the\r\nfirst day of his conversion to the last of his life, he lived without\r\npersonal possessions.[593] He had neither _menservants_ nor\r\n_maidservants_,[594] nor villages nor hamlets, nor in fact any revenues,\r\necclesiastical or secular, even when he was a bishop. There was nothing\r\nwhatever ordained or assigned for his episcopal mensa, by which the\r\nbishop might live; for he had not even a house of his own. But he was\r\nalmost always going about all the parishes[595] serving the Gospel,[596]\r\nand _living of the Gospel_,[597] as the Lord appointed for him when he\r\nsaid, _The labourer is worthy of his hire._[598] Except that more\r\nfrequently, _making the Gospel_ itself _without charge_,[599] as a\r\nresult of the labours of himself and his companions, he brought with\r\nhim that by which he might sustain himself and _those who laboured with\r\nhim in the work of the ministry_.[600] Further, if at times he had to\r\nrest he did so in the holy places which he himself had scattered through\r\nthe whole of Ireland; but he conformed to the customs and observances of\r\nthose with whom it pleased him to tarry, content with the common life\r\nand the common table. There was nought in his food, nought in his\r\nclothing, by which Malachy could be distinguished from the rest of the\r\nbrethren; to such a degree, though he was _greatest_, did he _humble\r\nhimself in all things_.[601]\r\n\r\n44. Then, when he went out to preach, he was accompanied by others\r\non foot, and on foot went he himself, the bishop and legate. That was\r\nthe apostolic rule; and it is the more to be admired in Malachy\r\nbecause it is too rare in others. The true successor of the Apostles\r\nassuredly is he who does such things. But it is to be observed how he\r\n_divides the inheritance with his brothers_,[602] equally descendants\r\nof the Apostles. They _lord it among the clergy_;[603] he, _though he\r\nwas free from all men, made himself the servant of all_.[604] They\r\neither do not preach the Gospel and yet eat, or preach the Gospel in\r\norder that they may eat; Malachy, imitating Paul, eats that he may\r\npreach the Gospel.[605] They _suppose that_ arrogance and _gain are\r\ngodliness_;[606] Malachy claims for himself by inheritance labour and\r\na load.[607] They believe themselves happy if they _enlarge their\r\nborders_;[608] Malachy glories in enlarging charity.[609] They _gather\r\ninto barns_[610] and fill the wine-jars, that they may load their\r\ntables; Malachy collects [men] into deserts and solitudes that he may\r\nfill the heavens. They, though they receive tithes and first-fruits\r\nand oblations, besides customs and tributes by the gift of Cæsar and\r\ncountless other revenues, nevertheless _take thought what they shall\r\neat or what they shall drink_;[611] Malachy _having nothing_ of such\r\nthings, yet _makes many rich_[612] out of the store-house of faith. Of\r\ntheir desire and anxiety there is no end; Malachy, desiring nothing,\r\nknows not how to think about the morrow.[613] They exact from the poor\r\nthat which they may give to the rich; Malachy implores the rich to\r\nprovide for the poor. They empty the purses of their subjects; he for\r\ntheir sins _heaps altars_[614] with vows and _peace-offerings_.[615]\r\nThey build lofty palaces, raise up towers and ramparts to the\r\nheavens.[616] Malachy, _not having where to lay his head,[617] does\r\nthe work of an evangelist_.[618] They _ride on horses_[619] with a\r\ncrowd of men, who _eat bread for nought_, and that not _their\r\nown_;[620] Malachy, hedged round with a college of holy brothers, goes\r\nabout on foot, bearing _the bread of angels_,[621] with which to\r\n_satisfy the hungry souls_.[622] They do not even know the\r\ncongregations;[623] he instructs them. They honour powerful men and\r\ntyrants; he punishes them. O, apostolic man, whom so many and so\r\nstriking _signs of his apostleship_[624] ennoble! What wonder, then,\r\nif he has wrought wondrous things when he himself is so wonderful? Yet\r\ntruly not he but God in him.[625] Moreover, it is said, _Thou art the\r\nGod that doest wonders._[626]\r\n\r\n45. (25). There was a woman in the city of Coleraine[627] who had a\r\ndemon. Malachy was called; he prayed for the possessed; he commanded the\r\ninvader and he went out. But his iniquity was not yet fully satisfied,\r\nand he entered into an unhappy woman who happened to be standing by. And\r\nMalachy said, \"I did not release that woman from your grasp in order\r\nthat you might enter this one; go out of her also.\" He obeyed, but went\r\nback to the former woman; and driven forth from her once more, he again\r\nwent into the second. So for some time he vexed them alternately,\r\nfleeing to and fro. Then the saint, indignant that he was mocked by a\r\ndemon, summoned up his spirit, and shouted; and when he had made an\r\nattack on the adversary with all the forces of faith, he drove the demon\r\naway from both, no less vexed than those whom he had vexed. But do not\r\nsuppose, reader, that the delay which he caused the saint was due to his\r\nown strength: it was permitted by the divine dispensation, evidently in\r\norder that by this as well the power of the evil one as the victory of\r\nMalachy might be made more manifest.\r\n\r\nHear now what he did elsewhere, but not by reason of his presence.\r\nAssuredly what he had power to accomplish when absent, he could do also\r\nwhen present.\r\n\r\n46. In a district of the northern part of Ireland a sick man lay in his\r\nhouse. His sickness was beyond doubt due to the evil influence of\r\ndemons. For one night he heard them talking; and one said to another,\r\n\"See that this wretched man does not touch the bed or bedding of that\r\nhypocrite, and so escape from our hands.\" The man perceived that they\r\nwere speaking of Malachy, who, as he remembered, had not long before\r\npassed a night in that house. And the bedding was still in its place;\r\nand taking courage, with his utmost effort he began to crawl, weak in\r\nbody but strong in faith. And lo, in the air there was clamour and\r\nshouting: \"Stop him, stop him, hold him, hold him; we are losing our\r\nprey.\" But, carried on by faith and the desire to escape, the more they\r\nshouted the more he hastened to the remedy, straining with knees and\r\nhands. And when he reached the couch, and went up on it, he rolled\r\nhimself in the bed-clothes, and heard the wailing of them that lamented,\r\n\"Alas, alas, we have betrayed ourselves, we have been deceived, he has\r\nescaped.\"[628] And quicker than a word, there left him the terror of the\r\ndemons and the horror which he suffered, and with them all his sickness.\r\n\r\nIn the city of Lismore a man vexed by a demon was delivered by Malachy.\r\n\r\nAlso once, when he was passing through Leinster, an infant was brought\r\nto him who had a demon, and he was brought back whole.\r\n\r\nIn the same region he ordered a mad woman,[629] bound with cords, to be\r\nloosed and to be bathed in water which he blessed. She washed and was\r\nhealed.\r\n\r\nAnother woman also in Saul,[630] a region of Ulaid,[631] who was tearing\r\nher own limbs with her teeth, he cured by praying and touching her.\r\n\r\nThere was a madman, who predicted many things to come. His friends and\r\nneighbours brought him to the man of God, bound strongly with cords,\r\nbecause his very madness had made him strong to do hurt and exceeding\r\nterrible. Malachy prayed, and immediately the sick man was healed and\r\nreleased. This was done in a certain place, the name of which we omit\r\nbecause it has a very barbarous sound, as also have many others.[632]\r\n\r\nAt another time in the above-mentioned city of Lismore,[633] the parents\r\nof a dumb girl[634] brought her to him in the midst of the street as he\r\npassed, asking him with much entreaty that he would deign to help her.\r\nMalachy stood and prayed; and he _touched her tongue_ with his finger\r\nand _spat_[635] upon her mouth, and sent her away speaking.\r\n\r\n47. (26). Going out of a certain church he met a man with his wife, and\r\nshe could not speak. And when he was asked to have mercy on her, he\r\nstood in the gate, the people surrounding him; and he gave a blessing\r\nupon her, and bade her say the Lord's Prayer. She said it, and the\r\npeople blessed the Lord.\r\n\r\nIn a city called Antrim[636] a certain man lying on a bed, now deprived\r\nfor twelve days of the use of his tongue, at the bidding of the saint,\r\nwho visited him, recovered his speech and received the Eucharist; and so\r\nfortified he breathed his last breath in _a good confession_.[637] O,\r\n_fruitful olive tree in the house of God_![638] O, _oil_ of\r\ngladness,[639] giving both anointing and light! By the splendour of the\r\nmiracle he gave light to those who were whole, by the graciousness of\r\nthe favour he anointed the sick man, and obtained for him, soon about to\r\ndie, the saving power of confession and communion.[640]\r\n\r\nOne of the nobles came in to him, _having somewhat to say to him_;[641]\r\nand while they were speaking, _full of faith_[642] piously stole three\r\nrushes from the couch on which Malachy sat, and took them with him: and\r\nGod wrought many things as a result of the pious theft, by that man's\r\nfaith and the sanctity of the prelate.\r\n\r\nBy chance he had come to a city called Cloyne.[643] And when he was\r\nsitting at table a nobleman of that city came in and humbly prayed him\r\nfor his wife, who was pregnant, and had passed the appointed time of\r\nparturition, so that all wondered, and there was none who did not\r\nbelieve that her life was in danger. With him also Nehemiah,[644] the\r\nbishop of that city, who was sitting next to him, made request to\r\nMalachy, and others also as many as were present reclining together.\r\nThen he said, \"I pity her, for she is a good and modest woman.\" And\r\noffering the man a cup which he had blessed, he said, \"Go, give her to\r\ndrink, and know that when she has taken the draught of blessing[645] she\r\nwill bring forth without delay, and without danger.\" It was done as he\r\ncommanded, and that very night there followed that which he promised.\r\n\r\nHe was sitting in a plain with the count of Ulaid, dealing with certain\r\nmatters, _and a great multitude_[646] was about them. There came a woman\r\nwho had long been with child. She declared that contrary to all the laws\r\nof nature she had already been pregnant for fifteen months and twenty\r\ndays. Malachy having pity for this new and unheard-of trouble, prayed,\r\nand the woman was delivered. Those who were present rejoiced and\r\nwondered. For all saw with what ease and rapidity she brought forth in\r\nthe same place, and the sad portent of birth denied was changed to a\r\nhappier marvel.\r\n\r\n48. (27). There happened in the same place an event with a similar\r\nmiracle but a different issue. He saw a man who was reported to be\r\nconsorting publicly with his brother's concubine; and he was a knight, a\r\nservant of the count. And publicly accosting the incestuous man he\r\ndisplayed himself to him as another John, saying, _It is not lawful for\r\nthee to have thy brother's_ concubine.[647] But he, nevertheless, in\r\nhis turn displaying himself to Malachy as another Herod, not only did\r\nnot hearken to him, but even answered him haughtily, and before them all\r\nswore that he would never put her away. Then Malachy, much agitated, for\r\nhe was vehemently zealous for righteousness, said, \"Then God shall\r\nseparate you from her against your will.\" Paying little heed the man\r\nwent away at once in a rage. And meeting the woman not far from the\r\ncrowd which was in the place, he treated her evilly and with violence,\r\nas though he wholly belonged to _Satan_ to whom he had a little before\r\nbeen _delivered_.[648] Nor was the crime hidden. The damsel who\r\naccompanied the lady ran back to the house (for it was not far from the\r\nplace), and, breathless, announced the wickedness that had taken place.\r\nAt the word her brothers, who were at home, enraged at the dishonour\r\ndone to their sister, rushed thither with all haste and slew the enemy\r\nof virtue, _taken in the very_ place and _act_[649] of crime, piercing\r\nhim with many wounds. The assembly was not yet dismissed when, lo! his\r\narmour-bearer proclaimed what had happened. And all wondered that the\r\nsentence of Malachy had taken such speedy effect. When this word was\r\nheard all evil-doers (for there were many in the land) feared and, being\r\nterrified, purified themselves, _washing their hands in the blood of the\r\nungodly_.[650]\r\n\r\n49. (28). Dermot the count,[651] who had now for a long time lain on his\r\nbed, he sprinkled with blessed water, and caused him to rise up without\r\ndelay, and so strong that he mounted his horse on the spot, surpassing\r\nassuredly the hope of himself and of his friends--rebuking him severely\r\nat the same time because he was a bad man _serving his belly_[652] and\r\nhis appetite immoderately.\r\n\r\nIn the town of Cashel a man came before him with his paralysed son,\r\nasking that he should be healed.[653] And Malachy, praying briefly,\r\nsaid, \"_Go thy way; thy son_ shall be made whole.\"[654] He went, and on\r\nthe morrow he returned with his son, who was nevertheless by no means\r\nwhole. Then Malachy rose and standing over him prayed at greater length,\r\nand he was made whole. And turning to the father he said, \"Offer him to\r\nGod.\" The man assented, but did not keep his promise; and after some\r\nyears his son, now a young man, relapsed into the same state, no doubt\r\nbecause of his father's disobedience and his violation of the pledge.\r\n\r\nAnother man came from a long distance, when Malachy was in the borders\r\nof Munster, bringing to him his son, who was entirely deprived of the\r\nuse of his feet. When he inquired how this had happened to him, he said,\r\n\"As I suspect, by the malignity of demons\"; adding, \"It was they, if I\r\nmistake not, who, when he was playing in a field, _caused a sleep to\r\nfall_ upon him,[655] and when the child awoke he found himself so.\"\r\nSaying this, he poured forth his petition with tears, and earnestly\r\nsought help. Malachy pitying him prayed, bidding the sick boy in the\r\nmeantime to sleep there upon the ground. He slept, and he arose whole.\r\nBecause he had _come from far_[656] he kept him some time in his\r\ncompany, and he used to walk with him.\r\n\r\n50. In the monastery of Bangor a certain poor man was maintained by the\r\nalms of the brothers; and he received a small sum every day, for\r\nperforming some office in the mill. He had been lame for twelve years,\r\ncreeping on the ground with his hands, and dragging his dead feet after\r\nhim. Him Malachy found one day before his cell, sad and sorrowful, and\r\nasked him the cause. And he said, \"You see how for a long time I am\r\nmiserably troubled and _the hand of the Lord is upon me_;[657] and lo,\r\nto increase my distress, men who ought to have had pity, rather laugh at\r\nme and cast my wretchedness in my teeth.\" And when he heard him, moved\r\nwith compassion, he _looked up to heaven_,[658] at the same time raising\r\nhis hands. Having said a short prayer he entered his cell, and the other\r\nrose up. And standing upon his feet he wondered if it was true,\r\nsuspecting that he was in a dream.[659] But he began to move with slow\r\nsteps, for he did not altogether believe that he could walk. At length,\r\n_as it were waking out of a deep sleep_,[660] he recognized the mercy of\r\nthe Lord upon him; he walked firmly, and returned to the mill _leaping_\r\nand exulting _and praising God_. When those saw him who had before seen\r\nand _known him_ they _were filled with wonder and amazement,[661]\r\nsupposing it to be a spirit_.[662]\r\n\r\nMalachy likewise healed a dropsical man by praying, who remained there\r\nin the monastery and was appointed shepherd.\r\n\r\n51. A city of Ireland called Cork was without a bishop. They proceeded\r\nto an election; but the various parties did not agree, each, as is\r\nusual, wishing to appoint their own bishop, not God's.[663] Malachy\r\ncame to the place when he heard of the disagreement. Calling together\r\nthe clergy and people he took pains to unite the hearts and desires of\r\nthe opposing parties. And when they had been persuaded that the whole\r\nbusiness ought to be entrusted to him, on whom in a very special manner\r\nlay _the care of_ that as also of the other _churches_[664] throughout\r\nIreland,[665] immediately he named to them, not any of the nobles of the\r\nland,[666] but rather a certain poor man whom he knew to be holy and\r\nlearned; _and he was a stranger_.[667] He was sought; and it was\r\nannounced that he was lying in bed, and so weak that he could in no\r\nwise go out unless carried in the hands of those who ministered to him.\r\n\"Let him rise,\" said Malachy; \"in the name of the Lord I command it;\r\nobedience will save him.\" What was he to do? He wished to obey, but he\r\nthought himself unfitted; for though it should be possible for him to\r\ngo, he dreaded to be a bishop. So with the will to be obedient twin\r\nenemies were contending, the load of weakness and the fear of the\r\nburden. But the first conquered, the hope of salvation being given him\r\nas an aid. Therefore he made the attempt, he moved, tested his power,\r\ndiscovered that he was stronger than usual. Faith increased along with\r\npower, and again faith made stronger gave in its turn increase of power.\r\nNow he was able to rise unassisted, now to walk somewhat better, now not\r\neven to perceive weariness in walking; at length, to come to Malachy\r\nwithout difficulty and quickly, unaided by man. He promoted him, and put\r\nhim into the chair, with the applause of clergy and people. This was\r\ndone without question, because neither did they dare to oppose the will\r\nof Malachy in any way, seeing the sign which he had wrought; nor did he\r\nhesitate to obey, being made surer, by so evident a proof, of the will\r\nof God.\r\n\r\n52. (29). A certain _woman was diseased with an issue of blood_;[668]\r\nand she was of noble birth and very dear to Malachy, though by reason of\r\nthe nobility rather of her character than of her descent. When she was\r\nentirely failing, her strength no doubt being exhausted with her blood,\r\nand was now near the end, she sent to the man of God, in order that--the\r\nonly thing that remained to be done--he might help her soul who should\r\nsee her no more in the body. When Malachy heard it he was troubled,\r\nbecause she was a woman of virtue, and her life fruitful in work and\r\nexample. And perceiving that he could not reach her in time he called\r\nMalchus, for he was young and active (he is that brother of Abbot\r\nChristian whom we mentioned above),[669] and said, \"Haste, take her\r\nthese three apples on which I have invoked the name of the Lord; I am\r\nassured of this, that when she tastes these she _shall not taste of\r\ndeath_ before _she sees_ us,[670] though we shall follow somewhat more\r\nslowly.\" Malchus hastened as he was commanded, and when he came he went\r\nin to the dying woman, showing himself another servant of Elisha, except\r\nthat his work was more efficacious.[671] He bade her take that which\r\nMalachy had blessed and sent to her, and to taste it if by any means she\r\ncould. But she was so refreshed when she heard Malachy's name, that she\r\nwas able to obey, and indicated by a nod (for she could not speak) that\r\nshe wished to be raised up for a little while. She was raised up, she\r\ntasted; she was strengthened by what she tasted, she spoke, and gave\r\nthanks. _And the Lord caused a deep sleep to fall upon_ her,[672] and\r\nshe rested most sweetly in it, having long ceased to enjoy the benefit\r\nof sleep, or to partake of food. Meanwhile _her blood was\r\nstaunched_[673] and awaking after a while she found herself whole,[674]\r\nbut she was still weak from long fasting and loss of blood. If in any\r\ndegree the cure was not complete,[675] on the following day the\r\nwished-for presence and appearance of Malachy made it perfect.\r\n\r\n53. (30). A nobleman lived in the neighbourhood of the monastery of\r\nBangor, whose wife was _sick nigh unto death_.[676] Malachy, being asked\r\nto _come down ere she died_,[677] to _anoint the sick_ woman _with\r\noil_,[678] came down and went in to her; and when she saw him she\r\nrejoiced greatly, animated by the hope of salvation. And when he was\r\npreparing to anoint her, it seemed to all that it ought rather to be\r\npostponed to the morning; for it was evening. Malachy assented, and when\r\nhe had given a blessing over the sick woman, he went out with those who\r\nwere with him. But shortly afterwards, suddenly _there was a cry\r\nmade_,[679] lamentation and great wailing through the whole house, for\r\nit was reported that she had died. Malachy ran up when he heard the\r\ntumult, and his disciples followed him. And coming to the bed, when he\r\nhad assured himself that she had breathed her last, he was greatly\r\ntroubled in mind, blaming himself that she had died without the grace of\r\nthe sacrament. And lifting up his hands to heaven he said, \"_I beseech\r\nthee_, Lord, _I have done very foolishly_. I, even _I, have\r\nsinned_,[680] who postponed, not she who desired it.\" Saying this he\r\nprotested in the hearing of all that _he_ would not _be comforted_,[681]\r\nthat he would give _no rest to his spirit_,[682] unless he should be\r\nallowed to restore the grace which he had taken away. And standing over\r\nher, all night _he laboured in his groaning_; and, instead of the holy\r\noil, flooding the dead woman with a great rain of _tears_,[683] he\r\nbestowed on her such a substitute for the unction as he could. Thus did\r\nhe; but to his companions he said, \"_Watch and pray._\"[684] So they in\r\npsalms, he in tears, passed a night of vigil. And when the morning came\r\nthe Lord heard His saint, for the _Spirit_ of the Lord was _making\r\nintercession for him_, who _maketh intercession for_ the saints _with\r\ngroanings that cannot be uttered_.[685] Why more? She who had been dead\r\n_opened her eyes_,[686] and, as those do who wake from a deep sleep,\r\nrubbing her forehead and temples with her hands, she rose upon the bed,\r\nand recognizing Malachy, devoutly saluted him with bowed head. And\r\nmourning being _turned into joy_,[687] amazement took hold of all, both\r\nthose who saw and those who heard. And Malachy also gave thanks and\r\nblessed the Lord. And he anointed her, nevertheless, knowing that in\r\nthat sacrament _sins are forgiven_, and that _the prayer of faith saves\r\nthe sick_.[688] After this he went away, and she recovered, and after\r\nliving for some time in good health, _that the_ glory _of God should be\r\nmade manifest in her_,[689] she accomplished the penance which Malachy\r\nhad enjoined upon her, and again _fell asleep_[690] in a _good\r\nconfession_,[691] and passed to the Lord.\r\n\r\n54. (3). There was also a woman whom _a spirit of_ anger and _fury_[692]\r\ndominated to such an extent that not only her neighbours and relatives\r\nfled from her society, but even her own sons could scarcely endure to\r\nlive with her. Shouting, rancour and _a mighty tempest_[693] wherever\r\nshe was. Violent, fiery, hasty, terrible with tongue and hand,\r\nintolerable to all, and hated. Her sons, grieving both for her and for\r\nthemselves, dragged her into the presence of Malachy, setting forth\r\ntheir lamentable complaint with tears. But the holy man, pitying both\r\nthe sickness of the mother and the trouble of her sons, called her\r\naside, and made urgent inquiry whether she had ever confessed her sins.\r\nShe replied, \"Never.\" \"Confess,\" said he. She obeyed; and he enjoined\r\npenance on her when she made confession, and prayed over her that\r\nAlmighty God might give her _the spirit of meekness_,[694] and in the\r\nname of the Lord Jesus bade her to be angry no more. Such meekness\r\nfollowed that it was plain to all that it was nothing else than a\r\nmarvellous _change effected by the right hand of the Most High_.[695] It\r\nis said that she is still living to-day, and is so patient and gentle\r\nthat, though she used to exasperate all, now she cannot be exasperated\r\nby any injuries or insults or afflictions. If it be allowed me, as the\r\nApostle says, _to be fully persuaded in my own mind_,[696] let each\r\naccept it as he will; for me, I give it as my opinion that this miracle\r\nshould be regarded as superior to that of raising the dead woman,\r\nmentioned above, inasmuch as there the outward, but here the _inner\r\nman_[697] was restored to life. And now let us hasten to what remains.\r\n\r\n55. A man who as regards the world was honourable, as regards God\r\ndevout, came to Malachy and complained to him concerning _the barrenness\r\nof his soul_,[698] praying that he would obtain for him from Almighty\r\nGod the grace of tears. And Malachy, smiling because he was pleased that\r\nthere should be spiritual desire from a man of the world, laid his cheek\r\non the cheek of the other as though caressing him, and said, \"_Be it\r\ndone unto you as you have asked_.\"[699] From that time _rivers of waters\r\nran down his eyes_[700] so great and so nearly incessant that the phrase\r\nof Scripture might seem applicable to him: \"_A fountain of gardens, a\r\nwell of living waters_.\"[701]\r\n\r\nThere is an island of the sea in Ireland, from of old fruitful of\r\nfishes;[702] and the sea there abounds in fish. By the sins of the\r\ninhabitants, as it is believed, the wonted supply was taken away, and\r\n_she that had many children was waxed feeble_,[703] and her own great\r\nusefulness utterly dwindled away. While the natives were grieving, and\r\nthe peoples taking ill the great loss, it was revealed to a certain\r\nwoman that a remedy might be effected by the prayers of Malachy; and\r\nthat became known to all, for she herself proclaimed it. By the will of\r\nGod it happened that Malachy arrived. For while he was going round and\r\nfilling the region with the Gospel, he turned aside thither that to them\r\nalso he might impart the same grace.[704] But _the barbarous\r\npeople_,[705] who cared more for the fishes,[706] demanded with all\r\nvehemence that he would deign to regard rather the sterility of their\r\nisland. And when he answered that it was not for that he had come, but\r\nthat he desired to catch men rather than fish,[707] yet seeing their\r\nfaith[708] he _kneeled down on the shore and prayed_[709] to the Lord\r\nthat, though they were unworthy of it, he would not deny them the\r\nbenefit granted long before, since they sought it again with so great\r\nfaith. _The prayer went up_,[710] there came up also _a multitude of\r\nfishes_,[711] and perhaps more fruitful than in ancient days; and the\r\npeople of the land continue to enjoy that abundance to this day. What\r\nwonder if _the prayer of a righteous man_ which _penetrates the\r\nheavens_,[712] penetrated _the abysses_,[713] and called forth from the\r\ndepth of the sea so great supplies of fish?\r\n\r\n56. There came, on one occasion, three bishops into the village of\r\nFaughart,[714] which they say was the birthplace of Brigit the\r\nvirgin;[715] and Malachy was a fourth. And the presbyter who had\r\nreceived them with hospitality, said to him, \"What shall I do, for I\r\nhave no fish?\" And when he answered that he should seek them from the\r\nfishermen, he said, \"For the last two years no fish have been found in\r\nthe river;[716] and for that reason the fishermen also are all scattered\r\nand have even abandoned their art.\" And Malachy replied \"Command them to\r\n_let down the nets_[717] in the name of the Lord.\" It was done, and\r\ntwelve salmon were caught. They lowered them a second time, and catching\r\nas many more they brought to the tables both an unlooked-for dish and an\r\nunlooked-for miracle. And that it might be clear that this was granted\r\nto the merits of Malachy, the same sterility nevertheless continued also\r\nfor the following two years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[576] Of which, it appears from this and other passages (see p. 33, n.\r\n1), he was still abbot.\r\n\r\n[577] 2 Cor. i. 15.\r\n\r\n[578] _Gentibus._\r\n\r\n[579] Ps. xlviii. 2.\r\n\r\n[580] Isa. xxxii. 20.\r\n\r\n[581] Cp.

They are arranged according to their\r\ncharacter. Thus the first four (§§ 45, 46) are instances of his power\r\nover demons.\r\n\r\n[627] Coleraine is said to have been founded by St. Patrick; and it\r\nwas certainly a religious establishment at least as early as the sixth\r\ncentury (Adamnan, i. 50). One of its erenachs died in 1122 (_A.F.M._).\r\nThe word \"city\" implies that the community was still in existence.\r\n\r\n[628] Compare the story of St. Gall listening to the conversation of\r\nthe demon of the mountain and the demon of the waters, told in\r\nStokes's _Celtic Church in Ireland_, p. 145, from the Life of St. Gall\r\nin _M.G.H._, Scr. i. 7.\r\n\r\n[629] The first of three miracles of healing the insane.\r\n\r\n[630] In Lecale, co. Down, near Downpatrick. There St. Patrick made\r\nhis first convert, and there he died. It is not easy to explain why\r\nSt. Bernard calls it a \"region.\" See further, p. 113, n. 3.\r\n\r\n[631] Ulaid was a district which included the greater part of the\r\npresent county of Down, and the southern part of Antrim.\r\n\r\n[632] For a similar avowal by Jocelin, who wrote in the same century\r\nas St. Bernard, and other illustrative passages, see Adamnan, p. 4.\r\n\r\n[633] See § 8, and above in this section.\r\n\r\n[634] The first of three healings of dumb persons.\r\n\r\n[635] Mark vii. 33.\r\n\r\n[636] The word \"city\" implies that there was a religious community at\r\nAntrim. That this was the case is proved by the round tower which\r\nstill remains, and other evidence (Reeves, p. 63). But apparently the\r\n_Annals_ do not refer to any monastery or church at that place. See,\r\nhowever, _U.A._ and _A.F.M._ at 1096 for a possible exception.\r\n\r\n[637] 1 Tim. vi. 13.\r\n\r\n[638] Ps. lii. 8 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[639] Ps. xlv. 7.\r\n\r\n[640] Cp.

The next\r\ntwo miracles are concerned with childbirth. The first of them may have\r\nbeen related to St. Bernard by Marcus, the author of Tundale's Vision\r\n(see Friedel and Meyer, _La Vision de Tondale_, p. iv., and above p.\r\nlxv. n. 3).\r\n\r\n[644] Nehemiah Moriarty, who died in 1149 (_A.F.M._), being then, it\r\nis said, 95 years old (Tundale, p. 5). In Tundale (p. 53 f.) he is one\r\nof four bishops who were with St. Patrick in Paradise, the others\r\nbeing Cellach, Malachy and Christian O'Morgair. He is there (pp. 5,\r\n54) called bishop of Cloyne (_Cluanensis_).\r\n\r\n[645] Cp. 1 Cor. x. 16.\r\n\r\n[646] Luke vi. 17.\r\n\r\n[647] Mark vi. 18.\r\n\r\n[648] 1 Cor. v. 5; 1 Tim. i. 20.\r\n\r\n[649] John viii. 4.\r\n\r\n[650] Ps. lviii. 10 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[651] Probably Dermot MacMurrough, who became king of Leinster in\r\n1126, and died in 1171. He was driven out of his kingdom in 1166, and\r\nthen invited the Anglo-Normans to come to his aid. The result was the\r\nconquest of Ireland. His character merits the description which St.\r\nBernard gives of it.\r\n\r\n[652] Rom. xvi. 18.\r\n\r\n[653] The first of three healings of paralysis.\r\n\r\n[654] John iv. 50.\r\n\r\n[655] Gen. ii. 21.\r\n\r\n[656] Mark viii. 3.\r\n\r\n[657] Acts xiii. 11, etc.\r\n\r\n[658] Mark vii. 34.\r\n\r\n[659] Cp.

It is at least\r\npossible that there was strife between different septs concerning the\r\nappointment of a coarb of Barre, founder of the church of Cork.\r\nMalachy may have taken advantage of the strife to nominate a ruler who\r\nbelonged to no sept in the district and who would allow himself to be\r\nconsecrated bishop. The vacancy may have been made by the death of\r\nDonnell Shalvey, erenach of Cork, in 1140 (_A.F.M._). The word\r\n_erenach_ is sometimes used at this period where we might have\r\nexpected to find _abbot_ (cp. _A.F.M._ 1137, quoted in Additional Note\r\nC, p. 167).\r\n\r\n[664] 2 Cor. xi. 28.\r\n\r\n[665] Evidently Malachy was now papal legate. The date of the incident\r\nis therefore not earlier than 1140.\r\n\r\n[666] It would seem that it was taken for granted that one of the\r\nleading men of a sept would be appointed, according to prevalent\r\ncustom, exemplified in the case of Armagh. This suggests that the\r\nvacant office was that of abbot. There would be nothing surprising in\r\nthe selection of a \"poor man,\" who was not a local magnate, as\r\ndiocesan bishop.\r\n\r\n[667] Luke xvii. 16, 18.--This was probably Gilla Aedha Ua Muidhin,\r\nwho attended the Synod of Kells in 1152 as bishop of Cork (Keating,\r\niii. 317), and died in 1172 (_A.U._). Since he attained \"a good old\r\nage\" there is no reason why he should not have been consecrated as\r\nearly as 1140 or 1141. He had been a monk of Errew in Lough Con, co.\r\nMayo (_A.T._ 1172), and was therefore \"a stranger,\" _i.e._ not a\r\nnative of Munster. He is called a \"poor man,\" no doubt, for the same\r\nreason as Malachy himself (§ 24), because he had embraced the life of\r\nvoluntary poverty. He had a reputation for piety and learning, for the\r\nAnnals describe him as \"full of the grace of God\" (_A.U._), and \"the\r\ntower of devotion and wisdom and virginity of Ireland\" (_A.T._). And\r\nif the tradition is trustworthy that he was abbot of St. John the\r\nEvangelist at Cork, founded by Cormac Mac Carthy \"for pilgrims from\r\nConnaught\" (see the charter of Dermot Mac Carthy printed in Gibson's\r\n_History of Cork_, ii. 348), and that it received its later name of\r\nGill Abbey from him, we can explain how he came to be near at hand\r\nwhen the election was taking place.\r\n\r\n[668] Matt. ix. 20.--In this and the next two sections we have three\r\nmiracles wrought on women; one at the point of death, another dead,\r\nand the third spiritually dead.\r\n\r\n[669] See § 14.\r\n\r\n[670] Matt. xvi. 28; Mark ix. 1; Luke ix. 27.\r\n\r\n[671] See 2 Kings iv. 29 ff.\r\n\r\n[672] Gen. ii. 21.\r\n\r\n[673] Luke viii. 44.\r\n\r\n[674] Cp.

(32). There was a certain clerk in Lismore whose life, as it is\r\nsaid, was good, but his faith not so. He was a man of some knowledge in\r\nhis own eyes, and dared to say that in the Eucharist there is only a\r\nsacrament and not the fact[718] of the sacrament, that is, mere\r\nsanctification and not the truth of the Body. On this subject he was\r\noften addressed by Malachy in secret, but in vain; and finally he was\r\ncalled before a public assembly, the laity however being excluded, in\r\norder that if it were possible, he should be healed and not put to\r\nconfusion.[719] So in a gathering of clerics the man was given\r\nopportunity to answer for his opinion. And when with all his powers of\r\ningenuity, in which he had no slight skill, he attempted to assert and\r\ndefend his error, Malachy disputing against him and convicting him, in\r\nthe judgement of all, he was worsted; and he retired, put to confusion\r\nby the unanimity though not sentenced to punishment.[720] But he said\r\nthat he was not overcome by reason, but crushed by the authority of the\r\nbishop. \"And you, Malachy,\" said he, \"have put me to confusion this day\r\nwithout good reason, speaking assuredly against the truth and contrary\r\nto your own conscience.\" Malachy, sad for a man so hardened, but\r\ngrieving more for the injury that was done to the faith, and fearing\r\ndangerous developments, called the church together,[721] publicly\r\ncensured the erring one, publicly admonished him to repent, the bishops\r\nand the whole clergy urging him to the same effect. When he did not\r\nsubmit, they pronounced an anathema upon him as contumacious and\r\nproclaimed him a heretic. But not aroused from sleep by this he said,\r\n\"You all favour the man, not the truth; I do not accept persons so that\r\nI should _forsake the truth_.\"[722] To this word the saint made answer\r\nwith some heat, \"The Lord make you confess the truth even of necessity;\"\r\nand when he replied \"Amen\" the assembly was dissolved. Burnt with such a\r\nbranding-iron he meditated flight, for he could not bear to be of ill\r\nrepute and dishonoured. And forthwith he departed, carrying his\r\nbelongings; when lo, seized with sudden weakness, he stood still, and\r\nhis strength failing he threw himself on the ground in the same spot,\r\npanting and weary. A vagabond madman, arriving by chance at that place,\r\ncame upon the man and asked him what he did there. He replied that he\r\nwas suffering from great weakness and unable either to advance or to go\r\nback. And the other said, \"This weakness is nothing else than death\r\nitself.\" _But this he spake not of himself, but_[723] God fitly rebuked\r\nby means of a madman him who would not submit to the sane counsels of\r\nmen of understanding. And he said, \"Return home, I will help you.\"\r\nFinally with his guidance he went back into the city: he returned to his\r\nright mind and to the mercy of the Lord. In the same hour the bishop was\r\nsummoned, the truth was acknowledged, error was renounced. He confessed\r\nhis guilt and was absolved. He asked for the viaticum, and\r\nreconciliation was granted; and almost in the same moment his perfidy\r\nwas renounced by his mouth and dissolved by his death. So, to the wonder\r\nof all, with all speed was fulfilled the word of Malachy, and with it\r\nthat of the Scripture which says, \"_Trouble gives understanding to the\r\nhearing._\"[724]\r\n\r\n58. (33). Between the peoples of certain regions there once arose\r\ngrievous discord.[725] Malachy was importuned to make peace between\r\nthem, and because he was hindered by other business he committed this\r\nmatter to one of the bishops. He made excuse and refused, saying that\r\nMalachy, not he, had been sought for, that he would be despised, that he\r\nwas unwilling to take trouble to no purpose. \"_Go_,\" said Malachy, \"_and\r\nthe Lord be with you_.\"[726] He replied, \"I assent, but if they will not\r\nhear me, know that I will appeal to your Fatherhood.\" Smiling, Malachy\r\nsaid, \"Be it so.\" Then the bishop, having called the parties together,\r\ndictated terms of peace; they assented and were reconciled to one\r\nanother, security was given on both sides, and peace was established;\r\nand so he dismissed them. But one party, seeing that their enemies had\r\nbecome careless and were unprepared, because peace having been made they\r\nsuspected no harm, _said_ among themselves, each man _to his\r\nneighbour_,[727] \"What are we minded to do? Victory and vengeance on\r\nour foes is in our grasp\"; and they began to attack them. What was\r\nhappening became known to the bishop, and hastening up he charged their\r\nchief with wickedness and guile, but he treated him with contempt. He\r\ninvoked the name of Malachy against him, and he paid no attention to it.\r\nLaughing at the bishop he said, \"Do you suppose that for you we ought to\r\nlet those go who did evil to us, whom _God hath delivered into our\r\nhands_?\"[728] And the bishop, remembering the conversation which he had\r\nhad with Malachy, _weeping and wailing_,[729] turned his face towards\r\nMalachy's monastery[730] and said, \"Where art thou, man of God, where\r\nart thou? Is not this, my father, what I told thee of? Alas, alas, I\r\ncame here that I might do good and not evil; and behold, through me all\r\nare perishing, these in the body, those in the soul.\" Many things in\r\nthis manner said he as he _mourned_ and _lamented_,[731] and he urged\r\nand addressed Malachy, as though he were present, against the wicked.\r\nBut meanwhile the impious men did not cease to attack those with whom\r\nthey had made peace, so as to destroy them; and behold there was _a\r\nlying spirit in the mouth of_ certain men to _deceive_ them.[732] And\r\nthese men met them in the way announcing that a raid had been made into\r\ntheir lands by their adversaries, that all things were being consumed\r\n_with the edge of the sword_,[733] and that their goods were being laid\r\nwaste, and their wives and children taken and led away. When they heard\r\nthis they returned in haste. The hindmost followed the first, _not\r\nknowing whither they went_[734] or what had happened; for they had not\r\nall heard the men who spoke. And when they came and found none of those\r\nthings which had been told them they were confounded, taken in their own\r\nwickedness;[735] and they _knew_ that they had been given up to _the\r\nspirit of error_,[736] on account of the messenger of Malachy whom they\r\ndeceived and his _name_ which _they despised_.[737] Further, the bishop,\r\nwhen he heard that the traitors were foiled in the iniquity which they\r\nhad devised, returned with joy to Malachy and told him all things in\r\norder which had happened to him.\r\n\r\n59. Malachy, knowing that by such an event the peace was disturbed,\r\ntaking suitable opportunity was at pains in his own person to restore\r\npeace once more between them, and to confirm it when restored by the\r\ngiving and receiving of security and an oath on both sides. But those\r\nwho before had suffered from the violation of peace, mindful of the\r\ninjury, and ignoring the agreement and the command of Malachy, took in\r\nhand to make reprisals. And all coming together, they set out to take\r\ntheir enemies unprepared and to return upon their own head the evil\r\nwhich they had thought to do to them.[738] And when they had very easily\r\nforded a great river which lay between them, they were stopped by a\r\nrivulet to which they came, not far from it. For indeed now it was not a\r\nrivulet, but appeared clearly to be a huge river, denying passage in\r\nevery part of it to those who desired to cross it. All wondered that it\r\nwas now so great, knowing how small it had been before, and they said\r\namong themselves, \"What has caused this inundation? The air is clear,\r\nthere are no rains, and we do not remember that there have been any\r\nlately; and even if there had been much rain, which of us remembers\r\nthat, to however great a flood it swelled, it ever before covered the\r\nland, spreading over sown ground and meadow? _This is the finger of\r\nGod_,[739] and the Lord _is hedging up our ways_,[740] on account of\r\nMalachy, His saint, whose _covenant we have transgressed_[741] and\r\ndisobeyed his commandment.\"[742] So these also, without accomplishing\r\ntheir purpose, returned to their own territory, likewise confounded. The\r\nreport was spread _throughout all the region_;[743] and they blessed\r\nGod, who _took the wise in their own craftiness_,[744] _and cutting off\r\nthe horns of the wicked_,[745] _exalted the horn of His anointed_.[746]\r\n\r\n60. One of the nobles hostile to the king[747] was reconciled by means\r\nof Malachy. For he did not trust the king sufficiently to make peace\r\nwith him except by the mediation of Malachy, or of one for whom the king\r\nhad equal reverence. His distrust was not unfounded, as afterwards\r\nappeared. For when he had become careless, and was no longer taking\r\nprecautions, the king captured him and put him in bonds, more truly\r\nhimself captured by ancient hate. His own friends demanded him by _the\r\nhand of the mediator_;[748] for neither did they expect anything but\r\nhis death. What should Malachy do? There was nothing to be done except\r\nto recur to that one accustomed refuge of his. Gathering an exceeding\r\nmighty army, a great crowd of his own disciples, he went to the king,\r\nand demanded him who was bound; he was refused. But Malachy said, \"You\r\nact unrighteously against the Lord, and against me, and against\r\nyourself, _transgressing the covenant_;[749] if you disregard it, yet\r\nshall not I. A man has entrusted himself to my guarantee; if he should\r\ndie, I have betrayed him. I am guilty of his blood. Why has it seemed\r\ngood to you to make me a traitor, yourself a transgressor? Know that _I\r\nwill eat nothing until_[750] he is liberated; no, nor these\r\neither.\"[751] Having said this he entered the church. He called upon\r\nAlmighty God with anxious groanings, his own and those of his disciples,\r\nthat He would deign to _deliver out of the hand of the transgressor and\r\ncruel man_[752] him who was unjustly sentenced. And that day and the\r\nfollowing night they persisted in fasting and prayer. Word was brought\r\nto the king of that which was being done; and his _heart was_ the more\r\n_hardened_[753] by that by which it ought to have been softened. The\r\ncarnal man took to flight, fearing lest if he remained near at hand he\r\nmight not be able to withstand the power of prayer; as though, forsooth,\r\nif he was hidden it could not find him, nor would penetrate to a remote\r\nplace. Do you put bounds, wretched man, to _the prayers of saints_?[754]\r\nIs prayer an arrow that has been shot, that you may _flee from the face\r\nof the bow_?[755] _Whither wilt thou go from the Spirit of God_, who\r\ncarries it, _or whither wilt thou flee from His presence_?[756] At last\r\nMalachy pursues the fugitive, he finds him who lies hidden. \"_You shall\r\nbe blind and not seeing_,[757] that you may see better, and may\r\nunderstand that _it is hard for you to kick against the pricks._[758]\r\nNay, perceive even now that _sharp arrows of the mighty_[759] have come\r\nto you, which, although they have rebounded from your heart, because it\r\nis of stone, have not rebounded from your eyes. Would that even through\r\nthe windows of the eyes they might reach to the heart, and _trouble give\r\nunderstanding_[760] to blindness.\" It could be seen that _Saul_ again\r\nwas _led by the hand_[761] and brought to Ananias, a wolf to a sheep,\r\nthat he might disgorge his prey. He disgorged it and _received\r\nsight_,[762] for to such a degree was Malachy like a sheep, if, for\r\nexample, it were to take pity even on the wolf. Note carefully from\r\nthis, reader, with whom Malachy had his dwelling, what sort of princes\r\nthey were, what sort of peoples. How is it that he also was not _a\r\nbrother to dragons, and a companion to owls_?[763] And therefore the\r\nLord _gave him power to tread upon serpents and scorpions_,[764] _to\r\nbind their kings with chains and their nobles with fetters of\r\niron_.[765] Hear now what follows.\r\n\r\n61. (34). He to whom Malachy had yielded the possessions of the\r\nmonastery of Bangor,[766] ungrateful for the benefit, from that time\r\nforward behaved himself always most arrogantly against him and his\r\nfollowers, hostile to them in all things, plotting everywhere, and\r\ndisparaging his deeds. But not without punishment. He had an only son,\r\nwho, imitating his father and daring himself to act in opposition to\r\nMalachy, died the same year. And thus he died. It seemed good to\r\nMalachy that a stone oratory should be erected at Bangor like those\r\nwhich he had seen constructed in other regions.[767] And when he began\r\nto lay the foundations the natives wondered, because in that land no\r\nsuch buildings were yet to be found.[768] But that worthless fellow,\r\npresumptuous and arrogant as he was, not only wondered but was\r\nindignant. And from that indignation _he conceived grief and brought\r\nforth iniquity_.[769] And he became a _talebearer among the\r\npeoples_,[770] now _disparaging secretly_,[771] now speaking evil\r\nopenly; drawing attention to Malachy's frivolity, shuddering at the\r\nnovelty, exaggerating the expense. With such poisonous words as these he\r\nwas urging and inducing many to put a stop to it: \"Follow me, and what\r\nought not to be done by any but ourselves let us not permit to be done\r\nagainst our will.\" Then with many whom he was able to persuade--_himself\r\nthe_ first _leader in speech_[772] as well as the origin of the\r\nevil--he went down to the place, and finding the man of God accosted\r\nhim: \"Good sir, why have you thought good to introduce this novelty into\r\nour regions? We are Scots, not Gauls. What is this frivolity? What need\r\nwas there for a work so superfluous, so proud? Where will you, _a poor\r\nand needy man_,[773] find _the means to finish it_?[774] Who will see it\r\nfinished? What sort of presumption is this, to begin, I say not what you\r\ncannot finish, but what you cannot even see finished? Though indeed it\r\nis the act of a maniac rather than of a presumptuous man to attempt what\r\nis beyond his measure, what exceeds his strength, what baffles his\r\nabilities. Cease, cease, desist from this madness. If not, we shall not\r\npermit it, we shall not tolerate it.\" This he said, proclaiming what he\r\nwould do, but not considering what it was within his power to do. For\r\nsome of those on whom he counted and whom he had brought with him, when\r\nthey saw the man[775] changed their minds and went no more with\r\nhim.[776]\r\n\r\n62. And to him the holy man spoke quite freely: \"Wretched man, the work\r\nwhich you see begun, and on which you look askance, shall undoubtedly be\r\nfinished: many shall see it finished. But you, because you do not wish\r\nit, will not see it;[777] and that which you wish not shall be yours--to\r\ndie: take heed that you do not _die in your sins_.\"[778] So it happened:\r\nhe died, and the work was finished; but he saw it not, for, as we have\r\nsaid already, he died the same year. Meanwhile the father, who soon\r\nheard what the holy man had foretold concerning his son, and knew that\r\nhis word was _quick and powerful_,[779] said, \"He _has slain my\r\nson_.\"[780] And by the instigation of the devil he burned with such\r\nrage against him that he was not afraid, before the duke and magnates of\r\nUlaid, to accuse of falsehood and lying him who was most truthful and a\r\ndisciple and lover of the Truth; and he used violent language against\r\nhim, calling him an ape.[781] And Malachy, who had been taught not to\r\n_render railing for railing,[782] was dumb, and opened not his\r\nmouth[783] while the wicked was before him_.[784] But the Lord was not\r\nforgetful of His word which He had spoken, _Vengeance is mine, I will\r\nrepay_.[785] The same day when the man returned home he expiated the\r\nrashness of his unbridled tongue, the avenger being the very one at\r\nwhose instigation he had let it loose. The demon seized him and cast him\r\ninto the fire, but he was soon pulled out by those that stood by; yet\r\nwith his body partly burnt, and deprived of reason. And while he was\r\nraving Malachy was called, and when he came he found the accursed man,\r\nhis foaming mouth contorted, terrifying all things with horrible sounds\r\nand movements, his whole body writhing, and scarcely to be kept in\r\nrestraint by many men. And when he prayed for his enemy the man of all\r\nperfection was heard, but only in part. For in a moment, while the saint\r\nwas praying, he opened his eyes, and recovered his understanding. But\r\n_an evil spirit of the Lord_[786] was left to him _to buffet him,[787]\r\nthat he might learn not to blaspheme_.[788] We believe that he still\r\nlives, and up to this time is expiating the great sin which he sinned\r\nagainst the saint; but they say that at certain times he is a lunatic.\r\nFurther, the aforesaid possessions, since he could no longer hold them\r\nby reason of his helplessness and uselessness, returned in peace to the\r\nplace to which they had belonged. Nor did Malachy refuse them, when the\r\nprospect of peace was held out at length after so much trouble.\r\n\r\n63. But now our narrative must return to the work of the building which\r\nMalachy had undertaken. And though Malachy had not the means, I do not\r\nsay to finish it, but to do any part of it, yet _his heart trusted in\r\nthe Lord_.[789] The Lord, in fact, provided that, though he _set not his\r\nhope on treasures of money_,[790] money should not be lacking. For who\r\nelse caused a treasure to be stored in that place, and being stored, not\r\nto be found till the time and work of Malachy? The servant of God found\r\nin God's purse what was not in his own. Deservedly, indeed. For what\r\nmore just than that he who for God's sake possessed nothing should enter\r\ninto partnership with God, and that they should both _have one\r\npurse_.[791] For the man who believes, the whole world is a treasury of\r\nriches; and what is it but a kind of purse of God? Indeed He says, _The\r\nworld is mine, and the fulness thereof_.[792] Hence it was that when\r\nmany pieces of silver were found Malachy did not put them back in their\r\nplace, but took them out of their place; for he bade the whole gift of\r\nGod to be spent on the work of God.[793] He considered not his own\r\nnecessities nor those of his companions, but _cast his_ thought upon\r\n_the Lord_,[794] to whom he did not doubt that he ought to resort as\r\noften as need required. And there is no doubt that that was the work of\r\nGod, because Malachy had foreseen it by God's revelation. He had first\r\nconsulted with the brothers concerning that work; and many on account\r\nof their lack of means were unwilling to assent to it. Anxious therefore\r\nand doubtful what he should do, he began to inquire earnestly in prayer\r\nwhat was the will of God. And one day coming back from a journey,[795]\r\nwhen he drew near to the place he viewed it some way off; and lo, there\r\nappeared a great oratory, of stone and very beautiful. And paying\r\ncareful attention to its position, form and construction, he took up the\r\nwork with confidence, having first however related the vision to a few\r\nof the elder brothers. Indeed so carefully did he adhere to all his\r\nattentive observations regarding place and manner and quality that when\r\nthe work was finished that which was made appeared closely similar to\r\nthat which he had seen, as if he also as well as Moses had heard the\r\nsaying, _Look_ that _thou make all things according to the pattern\r\nshewed to thee in the mount_.[796] By the same kind of vision there was\r\nshown to him before it was built, not only the oratory, but also the\r\nwhole monastery, which is situated at Saul.[797]\r\n\r\n64. (35). As he was passing through a certain city and a great multitude\r\nwas running together to him, by chance he saw a young man among the rest\r\neager _to see_ him.[798] He had _climbed up_ on a stone, and standing on\r\ntip-toes, with outstretched neck, contemplating him with eyes and mind,\r\nshowed himself to him as a kind of new Zacchaeus.[799] And it was not\r\nhid from Malachy (for the Holy Spirit revealed it) that he had truly\r\ncome _in the spirit and power of_ Zacchaeus.[800] He took no notice,\r\nhowever, at the time, and passed on in silence. But in the hospice that\r\nnight he told the brothers how he had seen him and what he had foreseen\r\nconcerning him. But on the third day behold he came with a certain\r\nnobleman, his lord, who disclosed the wish and desire of the young man,\r\nand asked that he would deign to receive him on his commendation, and\r\nhave him henceforth among his companions. And Malachy recognizing him\r\nsaid, \"There is no need that man should commend him _whom_ already _God\r\nhas commended_.\"[801] And taking him by the hand he delivered him over\r\nto our abbot Congan[802] and he to the brothers. But that young\r\nman--still living if I mistake not--the first lay conversus of the\r\nmonastery of the Suir,[803] has testimony from all that he lives a holy\r\nlife among the brothers, according to the Cistercian Order. And the\r\ndisciples recognized also in this incident that Malachy had _the spirit\r\nof prophecy_,[804] and not in this only, but in that which we shall add.\r\n\r\n65. When he was offering the sacraments,[805] and the deacon had\r\napproached him to do something belonging to his office, the priest\r\nbeholding him groaned because he had perceived that something was hidden\r\nin him that was not meet. When the sacrifice was over, having been\r\nprobed privately concerning his conscience _he confessed and denied\r\nnot_[806] that he had been _mocked_[807] in a dream that night. And\r\nMalachy enjoined penance upon him and said, \"It was your duty not to\r\nhave ministered to-day, but reverently to withdraw from sacred things\r\nand to show respect to so great and divine mysteries, that purified by\r\nthis humiliation you might in future minister more worthily.\"\r\n\r\nLikewise on another occasion,[808] when he was sacrificing and praying\r\nat the hour of sacrifice with his accustomed sanctity and purity of\r\nheart, the deacon standing by him, a dove was seen to enter through the\r\nwindow in great glory. And with that glory the priest was completely\r\nflooded, and the whole of the gloomy basilica became suffused with\r\nlight. But the dove, after flitting about for a while, at length settled\r\ndown on the cross before the face of the priest. The deacon was amazed;\r\nand trembling on account of the novelty both of the light and of the\r\nbird, for that is a rare bird in the land, fell upon his face, and\r\npalpitating, scarcely dared to rise even when the necessity of his\r\noffice required it. After Mass Malachy spoke to him privately and bade\r\nhim, as he valued his life, on no account to divulge the mystery which\r\nhe had seen, as long as he himself was alive.\r\n\r\nOnce, when he was at Armagh with one of his fellow-bishops, he rose in\r\nthe night and began to go round the memorials of the saints, of which\r\nthere are many in the cemetery of St. Patrick,[809] with prayer. And lo,\r\nthey saw one of the altars suddenly take fire. For both saw this great\r\nvision, and both wondered. And Malachy, understanding that it was a sign\r\nof the great merit of him, or those, whose bodies rested under that\r\naltar, ran and plunged into the midst of the flames with outstretched\r\narms and embraced the sacred altar. What he did there, or what he\r\nperceived, none knows; but that from that fire he went forth ablaze more\r\nthan his wont with heavenly fire, I suppose there is none of the\r\nbrothers who were with him then that does not know.\r\n\r\n66. These things have been mentioned, a few out of many, but many for\r\nthis time. For these are not times of signs, as it is written, _We see\r\nnot signs; there is no more any prophet._[810] Whence it appears\r\nsufficiently how great in merits was my Malachy, who was so rich in\r\nsigns, rare as they now are. For in what kind of _ancient miracles_[811]\r\nwas not Malachy conspicuous? If we consider well those few that have\r\nbeen mentioned, he lacked not prophecy,[812] nor revelation,[813] nor\r\nvengeance upon the impious,[814] nor _the grace of healings_,[815] nor\r\ntransformation of minds,[816] nor lastly raising the dead.[817] By all\r\nthese things God was blessed who so loved and adorned him, who also\r\nmagnified him _before kings_,[818] and gave him _the crown of\r\nglory_.[819] That he was loved is proved in his merits, that he was\r\nadorned, in his signs, that he was magnified, in his vengeance on\r\nenemies, that he had glory, in recompense of rewards. You have in\r\nMalachy, diligent reader, something to wonder at, you have also\r\nsomething to imitate. Now carefully note what you may hope for as the\r\nresult of these things. For _the end of these things is a precious\r\ndeath_.[820]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[718] _Rem._ This may have been a follower of Berengarius, who in his\r\nrecantation in 1059 anathematized the heresy that the bread and wine\r\n\"after consecration are merely a sacrament and not the true Body and\r\nBlood of our Lord Jesus Christ\" (Mansi, xix. 900).\r\n\r\n[719] Compare St. Bernard's method with Abélard, _V.P._ iii. 13;\r\nand for his dealing with a brother who did not believe in\r\ntransubstantiation, _ibid._ vii. 8, 9.\r\n\r\n[720] I follow the printed text: _de consensu confusus quidem exiit,\r\nsed non correptus_. But Mabillon, supported by A, has \"he retired from\r\nthe assembly confounded, but not brought to the right opinion\" (_de\r\nconuentu ... non correctus_). K reads _de conuentu ... non correptus_.\r\n\r\n[721] It would seem from this that Malachy was acting as legate. The\r\ndate is therefore after 1140.\r\n\r\n[722] Prov. xxviii. 21 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[723] John xi. 51.\r\n\r\n[724] Isa. xxviii. 19 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[725] In §§ 58-62 we have three stories in which Malachy appears as a\r\npeacemaker.\r\n\r\n[726] 1 Sam. xvii. 37, combined with 1 Chron. xxii. 16.\r\n\r\n[727] Gen. xi. 3 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[728] Judg. xvi. 24.\r\n\r\n[729] Mark v. 38.\r\n\r\n[730] This expression indicates that Malachy had a special relation to\r\none monastery.

(1) his\r\nown son Rory O'Conor, together with Donnell O'Flaherty and Cathal\r\nO'Conor, in 1143, (2) Murrough Ua Maelsechlainn, king of Meath, in\r\n1143, and (3) Teague O'Brien, in 1148. Release was obtained, in the\r\nfirst instance, in 1144 by the clergy of Ireland and the \"coarb of\r\nPatrick,\" who fasted at Rathbrennan. The coarb may have been Malachy.\r\nIn the second instance, it was secured through the influence of\r\ncertain \"sureties\"; and in the third, \"at the intercession of the\r\nbishops of Ireland with the coarb of Patrick, Mael Maedoc Ua Morgair\"\r\n(_A.F.M._, _A.T._).

The same conclusion follows from\r\nthe words \"We are Scots, _not Gauls_,\" lower down.\r\n\r\n[768] St. Bernard is speaking, not of stone churches in general, as\r\nhas sometimes been assumed, but of stone oratories, which may have\r\nbeen unknown in \"that land,\" _i.e._ the district about Bangor (see p.\r\n32, n. 3). The innovation would naturally cause dissatisfaction among\r\na conservative people. Indignation may also have been excited by the\r\nunusual size of the building; for it was \"a great oratory\" (§ 63). But\r\non the other hand, its ornate style cannot have contributed to the\r\nopposition which the project aroused; for it commenced when the\r\nfoundations were being laid. Indeed, however \"beautiful\" it may have\r\nbeen (§ 63), it was probably, like the churches of the Cistercians, of\r\nsimple design and devoid of ornament. See St. Bernard's _Apologia ad\r\nGuillelmum_, § 28 ff. (_P.L._ clxxxii. 914 f.). The only relic of the\r\nmedieval monastery of Bangor is a rudely built wall, once pierced by a\r\ndoor and a window, now built up. It seems to be later than the twelfth\r\ncentury. About 120 yards to the south-west of it is \"The Abbey\r\nChurch,\" still used for worship. The main part of this structure dates\r\nfrom the seventeenth century. But the core of the tower appears to be\r\nmuch earlier, and may be on the site of St. Malachy's oratory.\r\n\r\n[769] Job xv. 35 (vg.); Ps. vii. 14 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[770] Lev. xix. 16.\r\n\r\n[771] Ps. ci. 5.\r\n\r\n[772] Acts xiv. 12.\r\n\r\n[773] Ps. lxxiv. 21.\r\n\r\n[774] Luke xiv. 28.\r\n\r\n[775] _Viro_, _i.e._ Malachy.\r\n\r\n[776] Cp.

That\r\nfact, together with his relation to the brothers, revealed by the next\r\nfew sentences, makes it exceedingly probable that he was still their\r\nabbot.\r\n\r\n[794] Ps. lv. 23 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[795] Bangor was apparently his headquarters.\r\n\r\n[796] Heb. viii. 5.\r\n\r\n[797] Jocelin, writing towards the end of the twelfth century,\r\ndeclares that St. Patrick founded a monastery at Saul (_Vita S.\r\nPatricii_, cap. 32). But, apparently, neither in the Annals nor in any\r\nother authority earlier than Jocelin, is mention made of a monastery\r\nthere before St. Malachy's time. The text seems to imply that there\r\nwere no monastic buildings on the site when he founded (or re-founded)\r\nit. Malachy placed in his new monastery a convent of regular canons of\r\nSt. Augustine (_A.U._ 1170); but it never became an important\r\nestablishment, though it was still in existence in the sixteenth\r\ncentury. See Reeves, pp. 40, 220 ff.\r\n\r\n[798] This and the next story (§ 65) illustrate Malachy's power of\r\nreading the hearts of men.\r\n\r\n[799] Luke xix. 1-4.\r\n\r\n[800] Luke i. 17.\r\n\r\n[801] 2 Cor. x. 18.\r\n\r\n[802] See p. 4, n. 7.\r\n\r\n[803] _Suriensis monasterii._ The monastery of Inislounaght, close to\r\nthe River Suir, a mile or two to the west of Clonmel, co.

For information about it see an\r\narticle by the late Dr. Bagwell, in _J.R.S.A.I._ xxxix. 267 f. and\r\nJanauschek, _Orig. Cist._ p. 131.

Death and Burial at Clairvaux._\r\n\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1148, May (?)]\r\n\r\n67. (30). Being asked once, in what place, if a choice were given him,\r\nhe would prefer to spend his last day--for on this subject the brothers\r\nused to ask one another what place each would select for himself--he\r\nhesitated, and made no reply. But when they insisted, he said, \"If I\r\ntake my departure hence[821] I shall do so nowhere more gladly than\r\nwhence I may rise together with our Apostle\"[822]--he referred to St.\r\nPatrick; \"but if it behoves me to make a pilgrimage, and if God so\r\npermits, I have selected Clairvaux.\" When asked also about the time, [he\r\nnamed in reply] the festival of all the dead.[823] If it is regarded as\r\na mere wish, it was fulfilled, if as a prophecy, not _a jot passed_ from\r\nit.[824] _As we have heard so have we seen_[825] alike concerning place\r\nand day. Let us relate briefly in what order and by what occasion it\r\ncame to pass. Malachy took it amiss that Ireland was still without a\r\npall; for he was zealous for the sacraments, and would not that his\r\nnation should be wholly deprived of any one of them.[826] And\r\nremembering that it had been promised to him by Pope Innocent,[827] he\r\nwas the more sad that while he was still alive it had not been sent for.\r\nAnd taking advantage of the fact that Pope Eugenius[828] held the chief\r\nrule and was reported to have gone at that time to France,[829] he\r\nrejoiced that he had found opportunity for claiming it. He took for\r\ngranted that, the Pope being such a man as he was, and having been\r\npromoted from such a religious profession--and the more because he had\r\nbeen a special son of his own Clairvaux--he need not fear that he should\r\nhave any difficulty with him. Therefore the bishops were summoned; a\r\ncouncil assembled.[830] Matters which were of immediate importance at\r\nthe time were discussed for three days, and on the fourth the scheme of\r\nobtaining the pall was broached. Assent was given, but on condition that\r\nit should be obtained by another. However, since the journey was a\r\ncomparatively short one, and on that account the pilgrimage seemed more\r\neasy to be endured, none presumed to oppose his counsel and will. And\r\nwhen the council was dissolved Malachy started on his way.[831] Such\r\nbrothers as had come together followed him to the shore; but not many,\r\nfor he doubtless restrained them. One of them, Catholicus by name, with\r\ntearful voice and face, said to him, \"Alas! you are going away; and in\r\nhow great, almost daily, trouble you leave me you are not ignorant, and\r\nyet you do not, of your pity, give me help. If I deserve to suffer, what\r\nsin have the brothers committed that they are scarcely allowed to have\r\nany day or night free from the labour of caring for and guarding me?\" By\r\nthese words and tears of his son (for he wept) the father's _heart was_\r\ntroubled,[832] and he embraced him with caresses, and making the sign of\r\nthe cross on his breast said, \"Be assured that you will have no such\r\nsuffering till I return.\" Now he was an epileptic, and fell often;\r\ninsomuch that at times he suffered not once but many times a day. He had\r\nbeen a victim to this horrible disease for six years; but at the word of\r\nMalachy he made a perfect recovery. From that hour he has suffered no\r\nsuch thing; no such thing, as we believe, will he suffer henceforth, for\r\nhenceforth Malachy will not return.\r\n\r\n68. When he was just about to embark there _came unto him_ two of those\r\nwho _clave unto him_[833] more closely, boldly _desiring a certain thing\r\nof him_. And he said to them, _\"What would ye?\"_[834] And they answered,\r\n\"We will not say, except you promise that you will give it.\" He pledged\r\nhimself. And they said, \"We would have you certainly promise of your\r\ncondescension, that you will return in good health to Ireland.\" All the\r\nothers also insisted upon it. Then he deliberated for a while, repenting\r\nat first that he had bound himself, and not finding any way of escape.\r\nHe was _straitened on every side_,[835] while no way of safety presented\r\nitself from both dangers--of forfeiting his wish and of breaking his\r\npromise. It seemed at length that he should rather choose that which\r\ninfluenced him more strongly at the moment, and leave the rest to higher\r\nguidance. He assented, sadly it is true; but he was more unwilling that\r\nthey should be made sad; and pledging himself as they wished, he went on\r\nboard the ship. And when they had completed nearly half the voyage\r\nsuddenly a contrary wind drove the ship back and brought it to the land\r\nof Ireland again. Leaving the ship he passed the night in the port\r\nitself in one of his churches. And he joyfully gave thanks for the\r\nresourcefulness of the divine providence, by which it came about that he\r\nhad now satisfied his promise. But in the morning, he went on board, and\r\nthe same day, after a prosperous crossing, came into Scotland. On the\r\nthird day[836] he reached a place which is called Viride Stagnum;[837]\r\nwhich he had caused to be prepared that he might found an abbey there.\r\nAnd leaving there some of his sons, our brothers, as a convent of monks\r\nand abbot[838] (for he had brought them with him for that purpose) he\r\nbade them farewell and set out.\r\n\r\n69. And as he passed on, King David met him, by whom he was received\r\nwith joy and was detained as his guest for some days.[839] And having\r\ndone many things pleasing to God he resumed the journey that he had\r\nbegun. And passing through Scotland, at the very border of England he\r\nwent aside to the Church of Gisburn, where there dwell religious men\r\nleading a canonical life,[840] familiar to him of old for their\r\nreligious conversation and honourable character. At that place a woman\r\nwas brought to him, suffering from a disease horrible to see, which is\r\ncommonly called cancer; and he healed her. For when water which he\r\nblessed was sprinkled on the sores she ceased to feel pain. On the next\r\nday scarcely a sore was to be seen.\r\n\r\nDeparting thence he came to the sea, but was refused passage. The\r\nreason, if I am not mistaken, was that some difference had arisen\r\nbetween the chief pontiff and the king of England: for the king\r\nsuspected in that good man I know not what evil, if he should cross the\r\nsea;[841] for neither did he allow other bishops to cross.[842] That\r\nobstacle, though contrary to the will of Malachy, was not contrary to\r\nthe object of his wish. He grieved that the attainment of his desire\r\nshould be postponed, not knowing that by this it would be the rather\r\nfulfilled. For if he had immediately passed over the sea he would have\r\nbeen obliged to pass by Clairvaux in order to follow the chief Pontiff.\r\nFor by that time he had left it and was at or near Rome.[843] But now\r\nthrough this delay it was brought about that he crossed later, and so,\r\nas was fitting, he came to the place of his most holy death, and at the\r\nhour of its approach.\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1148, Oct. 13 or 14]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1148, Oct. 18]\r\n\r\n70. (37). And he was received by us, though he came from the west, as\r\nthe true _day-spring[844] from on high visiting us_.[845] O, how greatly\r\ndid that radiant sun fill our Clairvaux with added glory! How pleasant\r\nwas the festal day that dawned upon us at his coming! _This was the day\r\nwhich the Lord had made, we rejoiced and were glad in it._[846] As for\r\nme, with what rapid and bounding step, though trembling and weak,[847]\r\ndid I soon _run_ to meet him! With what joy I _kissed him_! With what\r\njoyful arms I _embraced_[848] this grace sent to me from heaven! With\r\nwhat eager face and mind, my father, _I brought thee into my mother's\r\nhouse and into the chamber of her that conceived me_![849] What festive\r\ndays I spent with thee then, though few! But how did he in his turn\r\ngreet us? In truth our pilgrim showed himself cheerful and kindly to\r\nall, to all incredibly gracious. _How good and how pleasant_[850] a part\r\nhe played among us as our guest, whom, forsooth, _he had come from the\r\nuttermost parts of the earth_ to see, not that he should _hear_, but\r\nthat he should show us, a _Solomon_! In fact we _heard_ his\r\n_wisdom_,[851] we had his presence, and we have it still. Already four\r\nor five days of this our festival had passed, when lo, on the feast day\r\nof Blessed Luke the Evangelist,[852] when he had celebrated Mass in the\r\nconvent[853] with that holy devotion of his, he was taken with a fever\r\nand lay down in his bed: and all of us were [sick] with him. _The end of\r\nour mirth is sorrow_,[854] but moderate sorrow, because for a time the\r\nfever seemed to be slight. You should see the brothers running about,\r\neager to give, or to receive. To whom was it not sweet to see him? To\r\nwhom was it not sweeter to minister to him? Both were pleasant and both\r\nsalutary. It was an act of kindness to do him service, and it was repaid\r\nalso to each one of them, by the gift of grace. All assisted, all were\r\nbusied _with much serving_,[855] searching for medicines, applying\r\npoultices, urging him often to eat. But he said to them, \"These things\r\nare without avail, yet for love of you I do whatever you bid me.\" For he\r\nknew that _the time_ of his departure was at hand.[856]\r\n\r\n71. And when the brothers who had come with him[857] urged him more\r\nboldly, saying that it behoved him not to despair of life, for that no\r\nsigns of death appeared in him,[858] he said, \"It behoves Malachy to\r\nleave the body this year.\"[859] And he added, \"See, the day is drawing\r\nnear which, as you very well know, I have always desired to be the day\r\nof _my dissolution_.[860] _I know whom I have believed and am\r\npersuaded_;[861] I shall _not be disappointed of_ the rest of _my\r\ndesire_,[862] since I already have part of it. He who by his mercy has\r\nled me to the place which I sought, will not deny me the time for which\r\nI wished no less. As regards this mean body, _here is my rest_;[863] as\r\nregards my soul, the Lord will provide, _who saveth them that put their\r\ntrust in Him_.[864] And _there is_ no small hope _laid up for me at that\r\nday_[865] in which so great benefits are bestowed by the living on the\r\ndead.\"[866] Not far away was that day when he spoke thus. Meanwhile he\r\nordered that he should be anointed with the sacred oil. When the convent\r\nof brothers was going out that it might be done solemnly,[867] he would\r\nnot permit them to come up to him; he went down to them. For he was\r\nlying in the balcony[868] of the upper house. He was anointed; and when\r\nhe had received the viaticum, he commended himself to the prayers of the\r\nbrothers, and the brothers to God,[869] and went back to bed. He went\r\ndown from the high balcony[870] on his feet, and again, as if that were\r\nnot enough, he went up on his feet; yet he said that death _was at the\r\ndoors_.[871] Who should believe that this man was dying? Himself alone\r\nand God could know it. His face did not seem to have become pallid or\r\nwasted. His brow was not wrinkled, his eyes were not sunken, his\r\nnostrils were not thin, his lips were not contracted, his teeth were not\r\nbrown, his neck was not gaunt and lean, his shoulders were not bowed,\r\nthe flesh on the rest of his body had not failed. Such was the grace of\r\nhis body, and such the _glory of his countenance which was_ not _to be\r\ndone away_,[872] even in death. As he appeared in life so was he also in\r\ndeath, more like to one alive.\r\n\r\n72. (38). Hitherto our story has run a rapid course; but now it stays\r\nbecause Malachy _has finished his course_.[873] He is still, and with\r\nhim we are still. Moreover, who would willingly hasten to [tell of]\r\ndeath? Especially thy death, holy father, who could describe it? Who\r\nwould wish to hear the story? Yet we loved _in life, in death we shall\r\nnot be divided_.[874] Brothers, let us not forsake in death him with\r\nwhom we companied in life. From further Scotland[875] he ran hither to\r\ndeath; _let us also go and die with him_.[876] I must, I must tell that\r\nwhich of necessity I saw. The celebration, everywhere renowned, of All\r\nSaints[877] comes, and according to the ancient saying, _Music in\r\nmourning is an unseasonable discourse_.[878] We come, we sing, even\r\nagainst our will. We weep while we sing and we sing while we weep.\r\nMalachy, though he sings not, yet does not lament. For why should he\r\nlament, who is drawing near to joy? For _us who remain_,[879] mourning\r\nremains. Malachy alone keeps festival. For what he cannot do with his\r\nbody he does with his mind, as it is written, _The thought of man shall\r\nconfess to thee, and the residue of thought shall keep the day of\r\nfestival to thee._[880] When the instrument of the body fails him, and\r\nthe organ of the mouth is silent, and the office of the voice ceases, it\r\nremains that with songs in his heart he keeps festival. Why should not\r\nthe saint keep festival, who is being brought to the festival of the\r\nsaints?[881] He presents to them what will soon be due to himself. _Yet\r\na little while_[882] and he will be one of them.\r\n\r\n73. Towards the dusk of night, when now somehow the celebration of the\r\nday had been finished by us, Malachy had drawn near, not to dusk but to\r\ndawn. Was it not dawn to him[883] for whom _the night is far spent and\r\nthe day is at hand_?[884] So, the fever increasing, a burning sweat from\r\nwithin him began to break out over his whole body, that, as it were\r\n_going through fire and through water, he might be brought into a\r\nwealthy place_.[885] Now his life was despaired of, now each one\r\ncondemned his own judgement, now none doubted that Malachy's word[886]\r\nwas prevailing. We were called; we came. And lifting up his eyes on\r\nthose who stood round him, he said, \"_With desire I have desired to eat\r\nthis passover_ with _you_;[887] I give thanks to the divine compassion,\r\nI have _not been disappointed of my desire_.\"[888] Do you see the man\r\nfree from care in death, and, not yet dead, already certain of life? No\r\nwonder. Seeing that the night was come to which he had looked forward,\r\nand that in it the day was dawning for him, so to speak triumphing over\r\nthe night, he seemed to scoff at the darkness and as it were to cry, \"_I\r\nshall_ not _say, surely the darkness shall cover me_, because this\r\n_night shall be light about me in my pleasure_.\"[889] And tenderly\r\nconsoling us he said, \"Take care of me; if it be allowed me I shall not\r\nforget you. And it shall be allowed. _I have believed in God_,[890] and\r\n_all things are possible to him that believeth_.[891] I have loved God;\r\nI have loved you, and _charity never faileth_.\"[892] _And looking up to\r\nheaven_[893] he said, \"O God, _keep them in Thy name_;[894] _and not\r\nthese_ only _but_ all them _also who through_ my _word_[895] and\r\nministry have given themselves to thy service.\" Then, laying his hands\r\non each one severally and blessing all,[896] he bade them go to rest,\r\n_because his hour was not yet come_.[897]\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1148, November 2]\r\n\r\n74. We went. We returned about midnight, for at that hour it was\r\nannounced that _the light shineth in darkness_.[898] The house filled,\r\nthe whole community was present, many abbots also who had assembled.\r\n_With psalms and hymns and spiritual songs_[899] we followed our\r\nfriend as he returned to his own country.[900] In the fifty-fourth\r\nyear of his age,[901] at the place and time which he had chosen\r\nbeforehand and predicted, Malachy, the bishop and legate of the holy\r\nApostolic See, taken up _by the angels_,[902] as it were from our\r\nhands, happily _fell asleep in the Lord_.[903] And indeed he slept.\r\nHis placid face was the sign of a placid departure. And verily _the\r\neyes of all were_ fixed _upon him_;[904] but none could perceive when\r\nhe departed. When dead he was thought to be alive, when alive, dead;\r\nso true was it that there was no difference which might distinguish\r\ndeath from life. The same vivacity of face, the same serenity, as\r\ncommonly appears in one who sleeps. You might say that death robbed\r\nhim of none of these things, but rather very greatly increased them.\r\nHe was not changed; but he changed us all. In wondrous fashion the\r\nsorrow and groaning of all suddenly sank to rest, _sadness_ was\r\nchanged _into joy_,[905] singing banished lamentation.[906] He is\r\nborne forth, voices are borne to heaven, he is borne into the oratory\r\non the shoulders of the abbots. _Faith has conquered_,[907] affection\r\ntriumphs, things assume their normal course. All things are carried\r\nout in order, all proceed in the way of reason.\r\n\r\n75. And in truth what reason is there to lament Malachy immoderately, as\r\nthough his _death_ was not _precious_,[908] as though it was not rather\r\nsleep than death, as though it was not the port of death and the portal\r\nof life?[909] _Our friend_ Malachy _sleepeth_;[910] and I, must I mourn?\r\nsuch mourning is based on custom, not on reason. If the Lord _hath given\r\nHis beloved one sleep_, and such sleep, in which there is _an heritage\r\nof the Lord_, even _children, and the reward, the fruit of the\r\nwomb_,[911] which of these things seems to call for weeping? Must I weep\r\nfor him who has escaped from weeping? He rejoices, he triumphs, he has\r\nbeen brought _into the joy of his Lord_,[912] and I, must I lament for\r\nhim? I desire these things for myself, I do not grudge them to him.\r\nMeanwhile the obsequies are prepared, the sacrifice is offered for\r\nhim,[913] all is performed according to custom with the greatest\r\ndevotion. There stood some way off a boy whose arm hung by his side\r\ndead, rather burdensome to him than useful. When I discovered him I\r\nsigned to him to come near, and taking his withered hand I laid it on\r\nthe hand of the bishop, and it restored it to life. For in truth _the\r\ngrace of healings_[914] lived in the dead; and his hand was to the dead\r\nhand what Elisha was to the dead man.[915] The boy _had come from\r\nfar_[916] and the hand which he brought hanging down, he carried back\r\nwhole to his own country. Now, all things having been duly accomplished\r\nin the very oratory of Saint Mary, Mother of God, _in which he was well\r\npleased_,[917] Malachy is carried to his burial[918] in the eleven\r\nhundred and forty-eighth year from the Incarnation of the Lord, on the\r\nfourth of the Nones of November.[919] Thine, good Jesus, is _the\r\ndeposit_ which has been committed to us,[920] Thine is the treasure\r\nwhich is laid up with us.[921] We _keep_ it[922] to be given back at the\r\ntime when Thou shalt see fit to recall it; only that he may not go forth\r\nwithout his comrades, but that him whom we have had as our guest we may\r\nhave also as our leader, when we _shall reign_ with Thee, and with him\r\nalso, _for ever and ever_.[923] Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[821] _I.e._ \"If I die in Ireland.\"\r\n\r\n[822] In Armagh.

On the death of Lucius II. he was elected\r\nPope, February 15, 1144, and assumed the title of Eugenius III. (H. K.\r\nMann, _Lives of the Popes_, ix. 131 ff.)\r\n\r\n[829] Eugenius left Viterbo at the beginning of 1147. He was at Lyons\r\nin March, and at Troyes on April 10 (Jaffé, p. 624 ff.; Mann, ix.\r\n185).\r\n\r\n[830] In accordance with the instructions of Innocent II. (§ 38): \"A\r\nSynod was convened at Inis Patraic by Mael Maedoc, coarb of Patrick,\r\nat which were present fifteen bishops and two hundred priests, to\r\nestablish rules and morals for all, both laity and clergy; and Mael\r\nMaedoc Ua Morgair, by the advice of the Synod, went a second time to\r\nRome (_sic_) to confer with the comarb of Peter\" (_A.F.M._ 1148).\r\nInispatrick is a small island off Skerries, co. Dublin. For the date\r\nsee _R.A.I._ xxxv. 249 f. In the same year Malachy had consecrated the\r\nmonastery of Knock (_A.F.M._ See p. 67, n. 3).\r\n\r\n[831] St. Bernard seems to have thought that St. Malachy set sail\r\nimmediately after the Synod, and from a port not far from the place\r\nwhere it met. But this is impossible, for one day's sail brought him\r\nto Scotland (§ 68). He seems to have embarked at Bangor, which is\r\nabout a hundred miles north of Inispatrick.\r\n\r\n[832] Cp. Lam. ii. 11.\r\n\r\n[833] Ruth i. 14.\r\n\r\n[834] Matt. xx. 20, combined with Mark x. 35, 36.\r\n\r\n[835] Susanna, 22.\r\n\r\n[836] That is, the first day after his landing in Scotland.\r\n\r\n[837] The Green Lake. It is now Soulseat, about eight miles from\r\nCairngarroch. At this place Fergus, lord of Galloway (p. 76, n. 4),\r\nfounded a famous monastery of Premonstratensian canons (Grub, _Eccl.\r\nHist. of Scotland_, i. 269), which must not be confused with Malachy's\r\nmore humble community.\r\n\r\n[838] The abbot was Michael, who had belonged to the community at\r\nBangor (§ 15). As this new community is called \"a convent of monks\" we\r\nmay infer that it was of the Cistercian Order.\r\n\r\n[839] Note the leisureliness of the journey in its earlier stages.\r\nLater on Malachy encountered difficulties, which no doubt involved\r\nfurther delay (Serm. i. § 1).\r\n\r\n[840] Gisburn is a village in the West Riding of Yorkshire on the\r\nriver Ribble, not far from the border of Lancashire. It is clear that\r\non this occasion Malachy followed the line of Watling Street, which\r\nran through Ribchester, on the Ribble, about fourteen miles from\r\nGisburn. His road probably passed within three miles of that place\r\nbetween Settle and Chetburn. He seems to have avoided entering England\r\nas long as possible--supposing no doubt, and with good reason, that he\r\nwas safer in the dominions of David than in those of Stephen. For\r\ndetails of the journey see _R.I.A._ xxxv. 239 ff., 249. The monastery\r\nof Gisburn, of which the ruins remain to the south of the parish\r\nchurch, was founded for Augustinian canons, in 1129, by Robert de Brus\r\n(Dugdale, vi. 1, 265 ff.).\r\n\r\n[841] Malachy was probably suspected (not without cause) of being an\r\nemissary of the supporters of the Empress Matilda. He had just spent\r\nsome days with David I., and with him and his stepson Waltheof he was\r\non terms of intimate friendship (§§ 36, 40). King David invaded\r\nEngland in the following year.\r\n\r\n[842] The reference is apparently to King Stephen's attempt to prevent\r\nTheobald of Canterbury and other bishops from attending the Council of\r\nRheims in March 1148. But Malachy does not seem to have been summoned\r\nto the Council, and he did not reach the Channel till long after it\r\nwas over (see next note).\r\n\r\n[843] Eugenius left Clairvaux on April 27, and Lausanne on May 20\r\n(Jaffé, p. 634). At this rate he might have been expected to reach\r\nRome by the end of July. About that time, therefore, we may conjecture\r\nthat Malachy was on the coast of Kent. Actually, the Pope was not near\r\nRome till he reached Viterbo on November 30 (_ibid._ 636). St.\r\nBernard, therefore, when he wrote this passage, was ignorant of his\r\nmovements for a considerable time before Malachy's death.\r\n\r\n[844] _Oriens_: literally, \"east.\"\r\n\r\n[845] Luke i. 78.\r\n\r\n[846] Ps. cxviii. 24.\r\n\r\n[847] St. Bernard's life-long and ever-increasing frailty is\r\nconstantly alluded to by his biographers. It was largely due to his\r\nextreme austerity. In this incident we have an example of the way in\r\nwhich, on many occasions, the strength of his mind conquered the\r\nweakness of his body (_V. P._ v. 4).\r\n\r\n[848] Gen. xxix. 13.\r\n\r\n[849] Cant. iii. 4.\r\n\r\n[850] Ps. cxxxiii. 1.\r\n\r\n[851] Matt. xii. 42; Luke xi. 31.\r\n\r\n[852] October 18. Malachy had therefore reached Clairvaux on October\r\n13 or 14. In the interval he met St. Gilbert of Sempringham and\r\npresented him with a pastoral staff (Dugdale, vi. 2, p. xii.). In\r\nFrance Malachy travelled alone--having been parted from his companions\r\nin England--and probably on horseback (§ 36). He may, therefore, have\r\nleft England about September 30, and traversed the 270 miles from\r\nWissant to Clairvaux by October 14. He apparently intended to start\r\nfor Rome on St. Luke's Day (Serm. i. § 1).\r\n\r\n[853] That is, in the presence of the community.\r\n\r\n[854] Prov. xiv. 13 (inexact quotation).\r\n\r\n[855] Luke x. 40.\r\n\r\n[856] Cp. 2 Tim. iv. 6, in which the phraseology of the vg. differs\r\nentirely from that of the text.\r\n\r\n[857] Not strictly accurate.

Cp. Serm. ii., § 6.\r\n\r\n[901] _A.F.M._ say, \"after the fifty-fourth year of his age.\" St.\r\nBernard appears to be right. For Malachy was made bishop of Connor\r\nwhen he was just entering his thirtieth year (§ 16), _i.e._ about his\r\ntwenty-ninth birthday. _A.F.M._ give the date as 1124. But if he was\r\nover fifty-four on November 2, 1148 (§ 75), his twenty-ninth birthday\r\nwould have been before November 1123. If he was under fifty-four on\r\nthat day it may have been in 1124.\r\n\r\n[902] Luke xvi. 22.\r\n\r\n[903] Acts vii. 60 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[904] Luke iv. 20.\r\n\r\n[905] Esth. xiii. 17 (vg.); xvi. 21 (vg.); cp.

He\r\nthen devoutly kissed his feet (_V.P._ iv. 21).\r\n\r\n[914] 1 Cor. xii. 9 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[915] 2 Kings xiii. 21.\r\n\r\n[916] Mark viii. 3.\r\n\r\n[917] Matt. iii. 17.\r\n\r\n[918] Malachy was buried on the north side of the Oratory, vested in\r\nSt. Bernard's habit. Five years later St. Bernard was buried before\r\nthe Altar of Saint Mary, clad in the habit in which Malachy died, and\r\nwhich he had worn ever since his death when he celebrated Mass (_V.P._\r\nv. 15, 23, 24). For further particulars of St. Malachy's burial and\r\nthe disposal of his relics see _R.Q.H._ lii. 43 f.\r\n\r\n[919] November 2. From this statement (see p. 128, n. 1) we may infer\r\nthat Malachy was born in 1095, before November.\r\n\r\n[920] 2 Tim. i. 12.\r\n\r\n[921] The biographers of St. Bernard give no detailed account of any\r\nof Malachy's visits to Clairvaux. But one of them--Geoffrey, St.\r\nBernard's secretary--wrote a prayer for the Bright Valley, in which he\r\nplaced Malachy on a par with the great Cistercian, thereby revealing\r\nto us the extraordinary impression which he made on the community\r\n(_V.P._ v. 25). I owe the following translation of it to a friend:\r\n\"Grant, O Lord, thy never-failing bounty to the spiritual harvest of\r\nthe Valley, which thou didst deem worthy to illumine with two stars of\r\nsuch surpassing brightness, so making it brighter in very truth even\r\nthan in name. Do thou guard the house wherein this twofold treasure is\r\nlaid up and guarded for thee. Be it also unto us according to thy\r\nword, that as thy treasure is there so may thy heart be also; there\r\ntoo thy grace and mercy: and may the favour of thy compassion for ever\r\nrest on all who are gathered together in the self-same place in thy\r\nName, which is above every name, even as thou art over all, God\r\nblessed for ever.--Amen.\"\r\n\r\n[922] 2 Tim. i. 12.\r\n\r\n[923] Rev. xxii. 5.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nLETTERS OF ST. BERNARD\r\n\r\n\r\nI\r\n\r\nTo Malachy. 1141.[924]\r\n\r\n(Epistle 341.)\r\n\r\nTo the venerable lord and most blessed father, Malachy, by the grace of\r\nGod archbishop of the Irish, legate of the Apostolic See, Brother\r\nBernard called to be abbot of Clairvaux, [desiring] to find grace with\r\nthe Lord.\r\n\r\n1. Amid the manifold _anxieties_ and _cares_ of my _heart_,[925] by the\r\nmultitude of which _my soul is sore vexed_,[926] the brothers _coming\r\nfrom a far country_[927] that they may serve the Lord,[928] _thy_\r\nletter, _and thy staff, they comfort me_:[929] the letter, as a proof of\r\ngood will; the staff, to support my weak body; the brothers, because\r\nthey serve the Lord _in a humble spirit_.[930] We have received them\r\nall, we are pleased with all, _all_ alike _work together for good_.[931]\r\nBut as to the wish that you have expressed that two of the\r\nbrothers[932] should be sent to look out a place for you beforehand,\r\nhaving taken counsel with the brothers, we have not thought it meet that\r\nthey should be _separated one from another[933] until Christ be more\r\nfully formed in them_,[934] until they are wholly instructed in _the\r\nbattles of the Lord_.[935] When therefore they have been taught in the\r\nschool of the Holy Spirit, when they have been _endued with power from\r\non high_,[936] then at length the sons shall return to their father that\r\nthey may _sing the Lord's song_, not now _in a strange land_,[937] but\r\nin their own.\r\n\r\n2. But do you yourselves in the mean time, according to _the wisdom\r\ngiven you_[938] by the Lord, look out beforehand and _prepare_\r\nbeforehand _a place for them_,[939] like the places which you have seen\r\nhere, apart from the commotions of the world. _For the time is at\r\nhand_[940] when, by the operation of the grace of God, we shall bring\r\nforth for you _new men_ out of the _old_.[941] _Blessed be the Name of\r\nthe Lord for ever,[942] of whose only gift it cometh that_[943] I have\r\nsons in common with you, whom your preaching _planted_ and our\r\nexhortation _watered_, but _God gave the increase_.[944] We beseech your\r\nholiness to _preach the word of the Lord_[945] so that you may _give\r\nknowledge of salvation unto His people_.[946] _For_ a double _necessity\r\nis laid upon you_,[947] both from your office as legate and your duty as\r\nbishop. Finally, since _in many things we offend all_,[948] and, being\r\noften thrown among the men of this age, we are much besmirched with the\r\ndust of the world, I commend myself to your prayers and to those of your\r\ncompanions, that in His fountain of mercy Jesus Christ, himself the\r\nfountain of pity, may deign to wash and cleanse us, who said to Peter,\r\n_If I wash thee not, thou shalt have no part with me._[949] And, indeed,\r\nI not only earnestly entreat this of you, but also require it as in some\r\nsense the payment of a debt, since I cry to the Lord for you, if the\r\nprayer of a sinner can do anything. Farewell in the Lord.\r\n\r\n\r\nII\r\n\r\nTo Malachy. 1141 _or_ 1142.[950]\r\n\r\n(Epistle 356.)\r\n\r\nTo Malachy, by the grace of God bishop, legate of the Apostolic See,\r\nBrother Bernard, called to be abbot of Clairvaux, if the prayer of a\r\nsinner can do anything, and if the devotion of a poor man is of any\r\nadvantage.\r\n\r\nWe have done what your holiness commanded, not perhaps as it was worthy\r\nto be done, yet as well as was possible considering the time in which we\r\nlive. So great evil everywhere struts about among us that it was\r\nscarcely possible to do the little that has been done. We have sent only\r\na few grains of seed,[951] as you see, to sow at least a small part of\r\nthat _field_ into which the true _Isaac_ once went out _to meditate_,\r\nwhen _Rebekah_ was first brought to him by Abraham's _servant_, to be\r\nhappily joined to him in everlasting marriage.[952] And the seed is not\r\nto be despised concerning which we find that word fulfilled at this time\r\nin your regions,[953] _Except the Lord of Sabaoth had left us a seed, we\r\nhad been as Sodoma, and been made like unto Gomorrha._[954] _I_,\r\ntherefore, have sown, do you _water_, and _God shall give the\r\nincrease_.[955] All the saints who are with you we salute through you,\r\nhumbly commending ourselves to their holy prayers and yours. Farewell.\r\n\r\n\r\nIII\r\n\r\nTo Malachy. 1143 _or_ 1144.[956]\r\n\r\n(Epistle 357.)\r\n\r\nTo our most loving father and most revered lord, Malachy, by the grace\r\nof God bishop, legate of the Holy and Apostolic See, the servant of his\r\nholiness, Brother Bernard, called to be abbot of Clairvaux, health and\r\nour prayers, of whatever value they may be.\r\n\r\n1. _How sweet are thy words unto my taste_,[957] my lord and father. How\r\npleasant is _the remembrance of thy holiness_.[958] If there is any\r\nlove, any devotedness, any good will in us, without doubt the charity of\r\nyour belovedness claims it all as its due. There is no need for a\r\nmultitude of words where affection blossoms abundantly. For I am\r\nconfident that _the Spirit which_ you have _from God_[959] bears\r\n_witness with your spirit that[960] what we are_,[961] however small it\r\nbe, _is yours_.[962] You also, most loving and most longed-for father,\r\n_deliver not_ to forgetfulness _the soul of the poor man_, which cleaves\r\n_to thee_ with the bonds of charity, _and forget not the soul of thy\r\npoor man for ever_.[963] For neither, as it were anew, _do we commend\r\nourselves unto you_[964] when now for a long time we _glory in the\r\nLord_[965] that our littleness has been worthy _to find grace in the\r\nsight of_ your holiness;[966] but we pray that our affection, no longer\r\nnew, may advance with new accessions day by day. We commend to you our\r\nsons, yea also yours, and the more earnestly because they are so far\r\nremoved from us. You know that, after God, all our trust was in you, in\r\nsending them, because it seemed to us wrong not to fulfil the prayers of\r\nyour holiness. See, as becomes you, that with your whole heart of love\r\nyou embrace them and cherish them. In no wise for any cause let your\r\nearnest care for them grow cold, nor let that perish _which thy right\r\nhand hath planted_.[967]\r\n\r\n2. We have now indeed learned both from your letter and from the report\r\nof our brothers[968] that the house is making good progress, [and] is\r\nbeing enriched both in temporal and spiritual possessions.[969]\r\nWherefore we rejoice greatly with you and give thanks with our whole\r\nheart to God and to your fatherly care. And because there is still need\r\nof great watchfulness, because the place is new, and the land\r\nunaccustomed to the monastic life, yea, without any experience of it,\r\n_we beseech you in the Lord,[970] that you slack not your hand_,[971]\r\nbut perfectly accomplish that which you have well begun. Concerning our\r\nbrothers who have returned from that place,[972] it had pleased us well\r\nif they had remained. But perhaps the brothers[973] of your country,\r\nwhose characters are less disciplined and who have lent a less ready ear\r\nto advice in those observances, which were new to them, have been in\r\nsome measure the reason for their return.\r\n\r\n3. We have sent back to you Christian, our very dear son, and yours. We\r\nhave instructed him more fully, as far as we could, in the things which\r\nbelong to the [Cistercian] Order, and henceforth, as we hope, he will be\r\nmore careful concerning its obligations.[974] Do not be surprised that\r\nwe have not sent any other brothers with him; for we did not find\r\ncompetent brothers who were ready to assent to our wishes, and it was\r\nnot our plan to compel the unwilling. Our much-loved brother,\r\nRobert,[975] assented on this occasion also to our prayers, _as an\r\nobedient son_.[976] It will be your part to assist him that your house\r\nmay now be set forward, both in buildings and in other necessaries. This\r\nalso we suggest to your fatherhood, that you persuade religious men and\r\nthose who, you hope, will be useful to the monastery, to come into their\r\nOrder, for this will be of the greatest advantage to the house, and to\r\nyou they will pay the greater heed. May your holiness have good health,\r\nbeing always mindful of us in Christ.\r\n\r\n\r\nIV\r\n\r\nTo the Brothers in Ireland. November 1148.[977]\r\n\r\n(Epistle 374.)\r\n\r\nTo the religious brothers who are in Ireland, and especially to those\r\ncommunities which Malachy the bishop, of blessed memory, founded,\r\nBrother Bernard, called to be abbot of Clairvaux, [wishing them] _the\r\nconsolation of the Comforter_.[978]\r\n\r\n1. If _here we had a continuing city_ we should rightly mourn with most\r\nabundant tears that we had lost such a fellow-citizen. But if _we_\r\nrather _seek one to come_,[979] as befits us, it is nevertheless no\r\nsmall cause of grief that we are bereaved of a guide so indispensable.\r\nWe ought, however, to regulate passion with knowledge and to mitigate\r\ngrief with the _confidence of hope_.[980] Nor does it become any one to\r\nwonder if love compels groaning, if desolation draws forth tears: yet we\r\nmust set a limit to these things, nay in no small measure be consoled\r\nwhile we gaze _not at the things which are seen, but at the things which\r\nare not seen; for the things which are seen are temporal, but the things\r\nwhich are not seen are eternal_.[981] First, indeed, we ought to rejoice\r\nwith the holy soul, lest he accuse us of want of charity, saying also\r\nhimself what the Lord said to the apostles, \"_If ye loved me ye would\r\nrejoice because I go unto the Father._\"[982] The spirit of our father\r\nhas gone before us to _the Father of spirits_,[983] and we are\r\nconvicted, not only as wanting in charity, but even as guilty of\r\ningratitude for all the benefits which came to us through him, if we do\r\nnot rejoice with him who has _departed_ from labour to rest, from danger\r\nto safety, from _the world unto the Father_.[984] Therefore, if it is an\r\nact of filial piety to weep for Malachy who is dead, yet more is it an\r\nact of piety to rejoice with Malachy who is alive. Is he not alive?\r\nAssuredly he is, and in bliss. _In the eyes of the foolish he seemed to\r\nhave died; but he is in peace._[985]\r\n\r\n2. Hence even the thought of our own advantage provides us with another\r\nmotive for great joy and gladness, because so powerful a patron, so\r\nfaithful an advocate has gone before us to the heavenly court.[986] For\r\nhis most fervent charity cannot forget his sons, and his approved\r\nholiness must secure _favour with God_.[987] For who would dare to\r\nsuppose that this holy Malachy can now be less profitable [than before]\r\nor less loving to his own? Assuredly, if he was loved aforetime, now he\r\nreceives from God surer proofs of His love, and _having loved his own,\r\nhe loved them unto the end_.[988] Far be it from us, holy soul, to\r\nesteem thy prayer now less effectual, for now thou canst make\r\nsupplication with more vigour in the presence of _the Majesty_[989] and\r\nthou no longer _walkest in faith_, but reignest _in the sight_ of\r\nHim.[990] Far be it from us to count that laborious charity of thine as\r\ndiminished, not to say made void, now that thou prostratest thyself at\r\nthe very fountain of eternal charity, quaffing full draughts of that for\r\nthe very drops of which thou didst thirst before. Charity, _strong as\r\ndeath_,[991] yea even stronger than death itself, could not yield to\r\ndeath. For even at the moment of his departure he was not unmindful of\r\nyou, with exceptional affection commending you to God, and with his\r\naccustomed _meekness and lowliness_[992] praying our insignificance also\r\nthat we should not _forget you for ever_.[993] Wherefore also we thought\r\ngood to write to you that you may know that we are ready to bestow upon\r\nyou all consolation with entire devotion, whether in spiritual things,\r\nif in them our insignificance can ever do anything by the merits of this\r\nour blessed father, or in temporal, if ever perchance opportunity should\r\nbe given us.\r\n\r\n3. And now also, dearly beloved, we are filled with heartfelt pity for\r\nthis grievous bereavement of the Irish Church.[994] And we unite\r\nourselves the more with you in suffering because we know that by this\r\nvery thing we have become the more your debtors. For the _Lord did great\r\nthings for us_[995] when He deigned to honour this place of ours by\r\nmaking it the scene of his blessed death, and to enrich it with the most\r\ncostly treasure of his body.[996] But do not take it ill that he is\r\nburied among us; for God so ordered, _according to the multitude of His\r\nmercies_,[997] that you should possess him in life, and that it might\r\nbe allowed to us to possess him, if only in death. And to us, indeed, in\r\ncommon with you, he was, and still is, father. _For_ even _in_ his\r\n_death_ this _testament was confirmed_ to us.[998] Wherefore as, for the\r\nsake of so great a father, we embrace you all as our true brothers, with\r\nthe unstinted yearning of charity, so also concerning yourselves,\r\nspiritual kinship persuades us that you are like-minded.\r\n\r\n4. But we exhort you, brothers, that you be always careful to _walk in\r\nthe steps of_ this _our_ blessed _father_,[999] by so much the more\r\nzealously as by daily proofs his _holy conversation_[1000] was more\r\ncertainly known to you. For in this you shall prove yourselves to be his\r\ntrue sons, if you manfully maintain the father's ordinances, and if, as\r\nyou have seen in him, and heard _from him how you ought to walk, you so\r\nwalk that you may abound more and more_:[1001] for the glory of a father\r\nis the wisdom of his sons.[1002] For even for us the example of so great\r\nperfection in our midst has begun in no slight degree both to expel our\r\nsloth and impel us to reverence. And would that he may in such wise\r\n_draw us after him_ that he may draw us to the goal, _running_ more\r\neagerly and more quickly in _the fragrance_ which his virtues have left\r\nso fresh behind them.[1003] May Christ guard all of you _while you pray\r\nfor us_.[1004]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[924] When this letter was written certain brothers, sent by Malachy\r\nafter his return from Rome (October 1140), had arrived at Clairvaux,\r\nand had spent some time there (see notes 5, 7); and the brothers left\r\nthere on his return journey had had a considerable amount of\r\ninstruction (n. 7). The date is therefore not earlier than 1141. But\r\nit is evidently earlier than that of Letter ii.\r\n\r\n[925] Cp.

BERNARD ON THE PASSING OF MALACHY\r\n\r\n\r\nSermon I\r\n\r\n(November 2, 1148.)[1005]\r\n\r\n1. A certain abundant blessing, dearly beloved, has been sent by the\r\ncounsel of heaven to you this day; and if it were not faithfully\r\ndivided, you would suffer loss, and I, to whom of a surety this office\r\nseems to have been committed, would incur danger. I fear therefore your\r\nloss, I fear my own damnation,[1006] if perchance it be said, _The young\r\nchildren ask bread, and no man offereth it unto them_.[1007] For I know\r\nhow necessary for you is the consolation which comes from heaven, since\r\nit is certain that you have manfully renounced carnal delights and\r\nworldly pleasures. None can reasonably doubt that it was by the good\r\ngift of heaven, and _determined by_ divine _purpose_,[1008] that Bishop\r\nMalachy should fall asleep among you to-day, and among you have his\r\nplace of burial, as he desired. For if not even a leaf of a tree _falls_\r\nto _the ground without_ the will of God,[1009] who is so dull as not to\r\nsee plainly in the coming of this blessed man, and his passing, a truly\r\ngreat purpose of the divine compassion?[1010] _From the uttermost parts\r\nof the earth he came_[1011] to leave his earth here. He was hastening,\r\nit is true, on another errand; but we know that by reason of his special\r\nlove for us he desired that most of all.[1012] He suffered many\r\nhindrances in the journey itself, and he was refused permission to cross\r\nthe sea till the time of his consummation was drawing near,[1013] and\r\nthe goal which could not be passed. And when, with many labours, he came\r\nto us _we received him as an angel of God_[1014] out of reverence for\r\nhis holiness; but he, out of his very deeply rooted _meekness and\r\nlowliness_,[1015] far beyond our merits, received us with devoted love.\r\nThen he spent a few days with us in his usual health: for he was waiting\r\nfor his companions, who had been scattered in England, when the baseless\r\ndistrust of the king was hindering the man of God. And when they had all\r\nassembled to him, he was preparing to set out to the Roman Court, on his\r\nway to which he had come hither;[1016] when suddenly he was overtaken by\r\nsickness, and he immediately perceived that he was being summoned rather\r\nto the heavenly palace, _God having provided some better thing for us_,\r\nlest going out from _us he should be made perfect_ elsewhere.[1017]\r\n\r\n2. There appeared to the physicians no sign in him, I say not of death,\r\nbut even of serious illness; but he, gladdened in spirit, said that in\r\nevery way it was befitting that this year Malachy should depart from\r\nthis life.[1018] We laboured to prevent it, both by earnest prayers to\r\nGod, and by whatever other means we could; but his merits prevailed,\r\nthat _his heart's desire should be given him and_ that _the request of\r\nhis lips_ should _not be withholden_.[1019] For so all things happened\r\nto him in accordance with his wishes; that by the inspiration of the\r\ndivine goodness he had chosen this place above all others, and that he\r\nhad long desired that he should have as the day of his burial this day\r\non which the general memory of all the faithful is celebrated.[1020]\r\nMoreover, these joys of ours were worthily increased by the circumstance\r\nthat we had selected that same day, by God's will, for bringing hither\r\nfrom the former cemetery for their second burial the bones of our\r\nbrothers.[1021] And when we were bringing them, and singing psalms in\r\nthe accustomed manner, the same holy man said that he was very greatly\r\ndelighted with that chanting. And not long after, he himself also\r\nfollowed, having sunk into a most sweet and blessed sleep. Therefore we\r\nrender thanks to God for all the things that He has disposed, because He\r\nwilled to honour us, unworthy as we are, by his blessed death among us,\r\nto enrich His poor with the most costly treasure of his body, and to\r\nstrengthen us, who are weak, by so great a _pillar_[1022] of His church.\r\nFor one or other of two _signs_ proves that it was _wrought for us for\r\ngood_,[1023] either that this place is pleasing to God, or that it is\r\nHis will to make it pleasing to Him, since He led to it _from the\r\nuttermost parts of the earth_[1024] so holy a man to die and to be\r\nburied there.\r\n\r\n3. But our very love for this blessed father compels us to sorrow with\r\nthat people from our heart, and to shudder exceedingly at the cruelty of\r\nhim, even Death, who has not spared to inflict this terrible wound on\r\nthe Church, now so much to be pitied. Terrible and unpitying surely is\r\ndeath, which has punished so great a multitude of men by smiting one;\r\nblind and without foresight, which has tied the tongue of Malachy,\r\narrested his steps, relaxed his hands, closed his eyes. Those devout\r\neyes, I say, which were wont to restore divine grace to sinners, by most\r\ntender tears; those most holy _hands_, which had always loved to be\r\noccupied in laborious and humble deeds, which so often _offered for_\r\nsinners _the saving sacrifice_[1025] of the Lord's body, and were\r\n_lifted up_ to heaven in prayer _without wrath and doubting_,[1026]\r\nwhich are known to have bestowed many benefits on the sick and to have\r\nbeen resplendent with manifold signs; those _beautiful_ steps also of\r\n_him that preached the Gospel of peace and brought glad tidings of good\r\nthings_; those _feet_,[1027] which were so often wearied with eagerness\r\nto show pity; those footprints which were always worthy to merit devout\r\nkisses;[1028] finally, those holy _lips of the priest_, which _kept\r\nknowledge_,[1029] _the mouth of the righteous_, which _spoke wisdom,\r\nand his tongue_ which, _talking of judgement_,[1030] yea _and of\r\nmercy_,[1031] was wont to heal so great wounds of souls. And it is no\r\nwonder, brothers, that _death_ is iniquitous, since iniquity _brought_\r\nit _forth_,[1032] that it is heedless, since it is known to have been\r\nborn of _seduction_.[1033] It is nothing wonderful, I say, if it strikes\r\nwithout distinction, since it came from _the transgression_;[1034] if it\r\nis cruel and mad, since it was produced by the subtlety of _the old\r\nserpent_[1035] and the folly of the woman. But why do we charge against\r\nit that it dared to assail Malachy, a faithful _member_, it is true, _of\r\nChrist_,[1036] when it also rushed madly upon the very _head_ of[1037]\r\nMalachy and of all the elect as well? It rushed, assuredly, upon One\r\nwhom it could not hurt; but it did not rush away unhurt. Death hurled\r\nitself against life, and life shut up death within itself, and _death_\r\nwas _swallowed up of life_.[1038] Gulping down the hook to its hurt, it\r\nbegan to be held by Him whom it seemed to have held.[1039]\r\n\r\n4. But perhaps some one may say, How does it appear that death has been\r\novercome by the Head, if it still rages with so great liberty against\r\nthe members? If death is dead, how did it kill Malachy? If it is\r\nconquered how has it still power over all, and _there is no man that\r\nliveth and shall not see death_?[1040] Death is clearly conquered--_the\r\nwork of the devil_[1041] and the penalty of sin: sin is conquered, the\r\ncause of death; and _the wicked one_ himself is _conquered_,[1042] the\r\nauthor both of sin and death. And not only are these things conquered,\r\nthey are, moreover, already judged and condemned. The sentence is\r\ndetermined, but not yet published. In fact, _the fire is prepared for\r\nthe devil_,[1043] though he is not yet cast into the fire, though still\r\nfor _a short time_[1044] he is allowed to work wickedness. He is become,\r\nas it were, the hammer of the Heavenly Workman, _the hammer of the whole\r\nearth_.[1045] He crushes the elect _for_ their _profit_,[1046] he\r\ncrushes to powder the reprobate for their damnation. As is the _master\r\nof the house_, so are _they of his household_,[1047] that is, sin and\r\ndeath. For _sin_, though it is not to be doubted that it was _nailed_\r\nwith Christ _to His cross_,[1048] was yet allowed still for a time,\r\n_not_ indeed to _reign_,[1049] but to dwell even in the Apostle himself\r\nwhile he lived. I lie if he does not himself say, _It is no more I that\r\ndo it, but sin dwelleth in me._[1050] So also death itself is by no\r\nmeans, indeed, yet compelled not to be present, but it is compelled not\r\nto be present to men's hurt. But there will come a time when it is said,\r\n_O death, where is thy victory?_[1051] For death also is _the last\r\nenemy that shall be destroyed_.[1052] But now, since He rules _who has\r\nthe power_ of life and _death_[1053] and confines the very sea within\r\nthe fixed limits of its shores, death itself to the beloved of the Lord\r\nis a sleep of refreshment. The prophet bears witness who says, _When he\r\ngiveth his beloved sleep, behold the heritage of the Lord._[1054] _The\r\ndeath of the wicked is indeed most evil_,[1055] since their birth is\r\nevil and their life more evil; but _precious is the death of the\r\nsaints_.[1056] Precious clearly, for it is the end of labours, the\r\nconsummation of victory, the gate of life, and the entrance to perfect\r\nsafety.\r\n\r\n5. Let us rejoice therefore, brothers, let us rejoice as is meet, with\r\nour father, for if it is an act of filial piety to mourn for Malachy who\r\nis dead, yet more is it an act of piety to rejoice with Malachy who is\r\nalive. Is he not alive? He is, and in bliss. Certainly, _in the eyes of\r\nthe foolish he seemed to have died; but he is in peace_.[1057] In fine,\r\n_now a fellow-citizen with the saints, and of the household of\r\nGod_,[1058] he at once sings and gives thanks, saying, _We went through\r\nfire and water; but thou broughtest us out into a wealthy place._[1059]\r\nHe _went_, clearly, in manly fashion, and he _went through_[1060]\r\nhappily. The true Hebrew celebrated the Passover in spirit, and as he\r\nwent, he said to us, \"_With desire I have desired to eat this Passover\r\nwith you._\"[1061] _He went through fire and water_,[1062] whom neither\r\nexperiences of sadness could crush, nor pleasures hold back. For there\r\nis below us a place which fire wholly claims as its own, so that the\r\nwretched Dives could not have there even the least drop of _water_ from\r\nthe _finger_ of _Lazarus_.[1063] There is also above _the city of God_\r\nwhich _the streams of the river make glad_,[1064] _a torrent of\r\npleasure_,[1065] _a cup which inebriates, how goodly_![1066] Here, _in\r\nthe midst_, truly is found _the knowledge of good and evil_,[1067] and\r\nin this place we may receive the _trial_ of pleasure and _of\r\naffliction_.[1068] Unhappy Eve brought us into these alternations. Here\r\nclearly is day and night; for in the lower world there is only night,\r\nand in heaven only day.[1069] Blessed is the soul which passes through\r\nboth, neither ensnared by pleasure nor _fainting at tribulation_.[1070]\r\n\r\n6. I think it right to relate to you, briefly, a specimen of the many\r\nsplendid deeds of this man, in which he is known to have _gone_, with no\r\nlittle vigour, _through fire and water_.[1071] A tyrannous race laid\r\nclaim to the metropolitan see of Patrick, the great apostle of the\r\nIrish, creating archbishops in regular succession, and _possessing the\r\nsanctuary of God by hereditary right_.[1072] Our Malachy was therefore\r\nasked by the faithful to combat such great evils; and _putting his life\r\nin his hand_[1073] he advanced to the attack with vigour, he undertook\r\nthe archbishopric, exposing himself to evident danger, that he might put\r\nan end to so great a crime. Surrounded by perils he ruled the church;\r\nwhen the perils were passed, immediately he canonically ordained another\r\nas his successor. For he had undertaken the office on this condition,\r\nthat when the fury of persecution had ceased and it thus became possible\r\nthat another should safely be appointed, he should be allowed to return\r\nto his own see.[1074] And there, without ecclesiastical or secular\r\nrevenues he lived in the religious communities which he himself had\r\nformed, dwelling among them up to this time as one of themselves, and\r\nabjuring all personal property.[1075] So the fire of _affliction\r\ntried_[1076] the man of God, but did not consume[1077] him; for he was\r\ngold. So neither did pleasure hold him captive or destroy him, nor did\r\nhe stand a curious spectator on the way, forgetful of his own\r\npilgrimage.\r\n\r\n7. Which of you, brothers, would not earnestly desire to imitate his\r\nholiness, if he dared even to hope for such an attainment? I believe,\r\ntherefore, you will gladly hear, if I perchance can tell it, what made\r\nMalachy holy. But lest our testimony should seem not easy to be\r\nreceived, hear what the Scripture says: _He made him holy in his faith\r\nand meekness._[1078] By faith he trampled on the world, as John bears\r\nwitness when he says, _This is the victory that overcometh the world,\r\neven our faith._[1079] For _in the spirit of meekness_[1080] he endured\r\nall things whatsoever that were hard and contrary with _good\r\ncheer_.[1081] On the one hand, indeed, after the example of Christ, by\r\nfaith he trampled on the seas,[1082] lest he should be entangled in\r\npleasures; on the other, _in his patience he possessed his soul_,[1083]\r\nlest he should be crushed by troubles. For concerning these two things\r\nyou have the saying in the Psalm, _A thousand shall fall at thy side,\r\nand ten thousand at thy right hand_;[1084] for many more are cast down\r\nby the deceitfulness of prosperity than by the lashes of adversity.\r\nTherefore, dearly beloved, let none of us, allured by the level surface\r\nof the easier way, suppose that road of the sea to be more convenient\r\nfor himself. This plain[1085] has great mountains, invisible indeed, but\r\nfor that very reason more dangerous. That way perhaps seems more\r\nlaborious which passes through the steeps of the hills and the\r\nruggedness of rocks; but to them that have tried it, it is found far\r\nsafer and more to be desired. But on both sides there is labour, on both\r\nsides danger, as he knew who said, _By the armour of righteousness on\r\nthe right hand and on the left_;[1086] so that we may rightly rejoice\r\nwith those that _went through fire and water and have been brought into\r\na wealthy place_.[1087] Do you wish to hear something about the _wealthy\r\nplace_? Would that another might speak to you of it. For as for me, that\r\nwhich I have not tasted I cannot indite.\r\n\r\n8. But I seem to hear Malachy saying to me to-day about this _wealthy\r\nplace_, _Return unto thy rest, O my soul; for the Lord hath dealt\r\nbountifully with thee: for he hath delivered my soul from death, [mine\r\neyes from tears, and my feet from falling]._[1088] And what I understand\r\nto be expressed in those words hear in a few sentences; _for the day is\r\nfar spent_,[1089] and I have spoken at greater length than I intended,\r\nbecause I am unwilling to tear myself away from the sweetness of the\r\nfather's name, and my tongue, dreading to be silent about Malachy, fears\r\nto cease. The death of the soul,[1090] my brothers, is sin; unless you\r\nhave overlooked that which you have read in the prophet: _The soul that\r\nsinneth, it shall die._[1091] Threefold, then, is the rejoicing of the\r\nman, since he is delivered from all sin, and from labour, and from\r\ndanger. For from this time neither is _sin_ said to _dwell in\r\nhim_,[1092] nor is the sorrow of penitence enjoined, nor from henceforth\r\nis he warned to guard himself _from_ any _falling_.[1093] _Elijah_[1094]\r\nhas laid aside his _mantle_;[1095] it was not that he feared, it was not\r\nthat he was afraid that it should be touched, still less _retained_, by\r\nan adulteress.[1096] He went up into the _chariot_;[1097] he is not now\r\nin terror of falling; he mounts delightfully; he labours not to fly by\r\nhis own power, but sits in a swift vehicle. To this _wealthy place_,\r\ndearly beloved, _let us run_ with all eagerness of spirit, in _the\r\nfragrance of the ointments_ of this our blessed father, who this day has\r\nbeen seen to have stirred up our torpor to most fervent desire. Let us\r\nrun after him, I say, crying to him again and again, \"_Draw us after\r\nthee_\";[1098] and, with earnest heart and advancing holiness of life,\r\nreturning devout thanks to the Almighty Pity, that He has willed that\r\nHis unworthy servants, who are without merits of their own, should at\r\nleast not be without the prayers of another.\r\n\r\n\r\nSermon II\r\n\r\n(November 2, 1149)[1099]\r\n\r\n1. It is clear, dearly beloved, _that whilst we are_ detained _in the\r\nbody we are absent from the Lord_.[1100] And throughout this wretched\r\ntime of detention banishment and conscience of faults enjoins upon us\r\nsorrow rather than joy. But because by the mouth of the apostle we are\r\nexhorted to _rejoice with them that do rejoice_,[1101] the time and the\r\noccasion require that we should be stirred up to all gladness. For if it\r\nis true, as the prophet perceived, that _the righteous rejoice before\r\nGod_,[1102] without doubt Malachy rejoices, who _in his days[1103]\r\npleased God_[1104] and _was found righteous_.[1105] Malachy ministered\r\nin _holiness and righteousness before Him_:[1106]the ministry pleased\r\nHim; the minister also pleased Him. Why should he not please Him? He\r\n_made the Gospel without charge_,[1107] he filled the country with the\r\nGospel, he tamed the deathly barbarism of his Irishmen, with the _sword\r\nof the spirit_[1108] he subdued foreign nations to the _light yoke_ of\r\nChrist,[1109] _restoring His inheritance to Him[1110] even unto the ends\r\nof the earth_.[1111] O, fruitful ministry! O, faithful minister! Is not\r\nthe promise of the Father to the Son fulfilled through him? Did not the\r\nFather behold him long ago when He said to the Son, _I shall give thee\r\nthe heathen for thine inheritance, and the uttermost parts of the earth\r\nfor thy possession_.[1112] How willingly the Saviour received what He\r\nhad _bought_,[1113] and had _bought with the price_[1114] of _His own\r\nblood_,[1115] with the shame of the Cross, with the horror of the\r\nPassion. How willingly from the hands of Malachy, because he ministered\r\n_freely_.[1116] So in the minister the freely executed office was\r\nacceptable,[1117] and in the ministry the conversion of sinners was\r\npleasing. Acceptable and pleasing, I say, in the minister was the\r\n_singleness of eye_,[1118] but in the ministry _the salvation of the\r\npeople_.[1119]\r\n\r\n2. However, even though a less effective result of the ministry\r\nfollowed, He would nevertheless justly have had regard to Malachy and\r\nhis works, He to whom purity is a friend and single-mindedness one of\r\nhis household, to whose righteousness it belongs to weigh the work in\r\naccordance with its purpose, from the character of _the eye_ to measure\r\nthe state of _the whole body_.[1120] But now _the works of the Lord are\r\ngreat, sought out according to all_ the _desires_[1121] and efforts of\r\nMalachy; they are great and many and _very good_,[1122] though better in\r\nproportion to the good origin of the pure purpose. What work of piety\r\nescaped the attention of Malachy? He was poor as regards himself, but\r\nrich to the poor. He was a _father of the fatherless_, a husband _of the\r\nwidows_,[1123] a protector of the oppressed. _A cheerful giver_,[1124]\r\nseldom making petitions, modest in receiving gifts. He was specially\r\nsolicitous, and had much success, in restoring peace between those who\r\nwere at variance. Who was as tender as he in sharing the sufferings of\r\nothers? who as ready to help? who as free in rebuke? For he was zealous,\r\nand yet not wanting in knowledge, the restrainer of zeal. And, indeed,\r\n_to the weak_ he was _weak_,[1125] but none the less strong to the\r\nstrong: he _resisted the proud_,[1126] he lashed the tyrants, a teacher\r\nof kings and princes. It was he who by prayer deprived a king of sight\r\nwhen he worked wickedness, and restored it when he was humbled.[1127] It\r\nwas he, when certain men broke a peace which he had made, who gave them\r\nup to _the spirit of error_,[1128] and foiled them in the evil which\r\nthey devised to do; and who compelled them to accept peace a second\r\ntime, confounded and stunned by that which had happened to them. It was\r\nhe[1129] to whom a river most opportunely lent its aid against the\r\nothers, who were equally _transgressors of a covenant_.[1130] In\r\nwonderful fashion, by throwing itself before them, it made void the\r\nefforts of the ungodly. There had been no rains, no floods of waters, no\r\ngathering of clouds, no melting of snows, when suddenly the mere rivulet\r\nwas converted into a great river; and it rushed along[1131] and swelling\r\nup overflowed the banks, and utterly denied passage to those who wished\r\nto do wickedly.[1132]\r\n\r\n3. What things we have heard and known of the wrath of the man and his\r\nvengeance on his enemies, while yet he was _sweet and gentle and\r\nplenteous in mercy unto all_[1133] that suffered need! For he lived for\r\nall as though he were the one parent of all.[1134] _As a hen her\r\nchickens_,[1135] so he cherished all and _protected them under the\r\ncovert of his wings_.[1136] He made no distinction of sex or age, of\r\ncondition or person;[1137] he failed none, his loving heart embraced\r\nall. In whatsoever affliction men cried to him he counted it his own:\r\neven more than that, for in regard to his own afflictions he was\r\npatient, in regard to those of others he was compassionate, very often\r\neven passionate. For indeed sometimes, filled with wrath, he was stirred\r\nto take the part of one against another, that by _delivering the poor_\r\nand restraining the _strong_[1138] he might take thought in equal\r\nmeasure for the salvation of all. Therefore he was angry; but it was in\r\norder that he might not sin by not being angry, according to the words\r\nof the Psalm, _Be ye angry and sin not._[1139] Anger did not rule him,\r\nbut he himself _ruled his spirit_.[1140] He had power over himself.\r\nAssuredly he who had the victory over himself could not be _mastered by\r\nanger_.[1141] His anger was kept in hand. When it was summoned it came,\r\ngoing forth, not bursting forth; it was brought into action by his will,\r\nnot by impulse. He was not set on fire by it, but used it.[1142] As well\r\nin this as in ruling and restraining all the motions both of his inner\r\nand his outer man[1143] his judgement was careful, his caution great.\r\nFor he did not give so much attention to all, as to leave himself alone\r\nout of account, as, in his universal solicitude, to disregard only\r\nhimself. He was careful of himself also. He _guarded himself_.[1144] In\r\nfact, he was so wholly his own, so wholly also belonged to all, that his\r\nlove seemed in no degree to hinder or delay him from his guardianship of\r\nhimself, nor his concern for his own person from the common good.[1145]\r\nIf you saw the man busied in the midst of crowds, involved in cares, you\r\nwould say he was born for his country, _not for himself_.[1146] If you\r\nsaw the man alone and dwelling by himself, you would suppose that he\r\nlived for God alone and for himself.\r\n\r\n4. Without tumult he went about among tumults; without ease he spent the\r\ntime which he gave to ease. How could he be taking his ease[1147] when\r\nhe _was occupied in the statutes of the Lord_?[1148] For though he had\r\ntime free from the necessities of the peoples, yet had he none\r\nunoccupied by holy meditations, by the work of prayer, by the ease\r\nitself of contemplation. In the time of ease he spoke gravely or not at\r\nall. His mien was either courteous, or humble and self-restrained.\r\nAssuredly--a trait which is counted worthy of much praise among the\r\nwise--_his eye was in his head_,[1149] never flying forth except when it\r\nwas obedient to power. His laughter displayed love, or provoked it: but\r\neven so it was rare. Sometimes indeed, it came forth, but it was never\r\nforced, intimating the gladness of his heart in such a way that his\r\nmouth did not lose but gained in grace.[1150] So modest was it that it\r\ncould not be suspected of levity; so gentle,[1151] however, that it\r\nsufficed to free his joyous countenance from every trace and shadow of\r\nsadness.[1152] O perfect gift! O _rich burnt sacrifice_![1153] O\r\npleasing service in mind and hand! How _sweet unto God is the\r\nsavour_[1154] of him who employs his leisure in prayers, how sweet unto\r\nmen of him who is occupied in fatiguing labours.\r\n\r\n5. Because he was such an one, then, _beloved of God_[1155] and men, not\r\nundeservedly was Malachy received this day into the company of angels,\r\nhaving attained in fact what his name denoted.[1156] And indeed, already\r\nhe was an angel not less in purity than in name. But now more happily is\r\nthe significance of his glorious name fulfilled in him, since he is glad\r\nwith a glory and happiness equal to that of the angels.[1157] Let us\r\nalso, dearly beloved, be glad because our _angel ascended_[1158] to his\r\nfellow-citizens, acting as an ambassador for _the children of the\r\ncaptivity_,[1159] winning for us the favour of the blessed ones,\r\ndeclaring to them the desires of the wretched. Let us _be glad_, I say,\r\n_and rejoice_,[1160] because in that heavenly court[1161] there is one\r\nwho went forth from us to take care of us,[1162] to protect us by his\r\nmerits,[1163] whom he instructed[1164] by his example and\r\nstrengthened[1165] by his miracles.\r\n\r\n6. The holy pontiff, who _in a humble spirit_[1166] often brought\r\npeace-offerings to the heavens, to-day in his own person has _gone unto\r\nthe altar of God_,[1167] himself the victim and the priest. With the\r\ndeparture of the priest the rite of sacrifice is changed into a better\r\nthing. The _fountain of tears_[1168] is dried up, every burnt sacrifice\r\nis made _with gladness and rejoicing_.[1169] _Blessed be the Lord God\r\nof_ Malachy, who by the ministry of so great a pontiff _hath visited his\r\npeople_,[1170] and now, _taking him up into the holy city_,[1171]\r\nceaseth not, by the remembrance of so great sweetness to _comfort our\r\ncaptivity_.[1172] Let _the spirit of_ Malachy _rejoice in the\r\nLord_,[1173] because he is freed from the heavy load of the body, and is\r\nno longer hindered, by the weight of impure and earthly matter, from\r\npassing with all eagerness and fullness of life, through the whole\r\ncreation, corporeal and incorporeal, that he may enter entirely into\r\nGod, and _joined to_ Him may with Him _be one spirit_[1174] for\r\never.[1175]\r\n\r\n7. _Holiness becometh_ that _house_[1176] in _which the remembrance of_\r\nso great _holiness_[1177] is celebrated. Holy Malachy, preserve it _in\r\nholiness and righteousness_[1178] pitying us who in the midst of so many\r\nand great miseries _utter the memory of thine abundant goodness_.[1179]\r\nGreat is the dispensation of the mercy of God upon thee, who made thee\r\n_little in thine own sight_,[1180] great in His; who _did_ great things\r\nby thee, in saving thy country, _great things to thee_,[1181] in\r\nbringing thee into His glory. May thy festival, which is deservedly\r\ndevoted to thy virtues, have a saving efficacy for us by thy merits and\r\nprayers. _May the glory of thy holiness_,[1182] which is celebrated by\r\nus, be continued by angels: so shall it meetly be pleasant for us, if it\r\nbe also fruitful. While thou departest be it allowed to us, who are met\r\ntogether to-day in thy so delicious feast, to preserve some remnants of\r\nthe fruits of the Spirit, loaded with which thou ascendest.\r\n\r\n8. Be to us, we beseech thee, holy Malachy, another Moses, or another\r\nElijah, like them imparting _of thy spirit_[1183] to us, for thou hast\r\ncome _in_ their _spirit and power_.[1184] Thy life was _a law of life\r\nand knowledge_,[1185] thy death the port of death and the portal of\r\nlife,[1186] thy memory the delight of sweetness and grace, thy\r\npresence _a crown of glory in the hand of the Lord_[1187] thy God. O\r\n_fruitful olive tree in the house of God_![1188] O _oil of\r\ngladness_,[1189] giving both anointing and light, cherishing with\r\nfavours, _resplendent with miracles_,[1190] make us partakers of that\r\nlight and graciousness which thou enjoyest.[1191] O sweet-smelling\r\n_lily, blossoming and budding_ evermore before the Lord, and spreading\r\neverywhere a _sweet_ and life-giving _savour_,[1192] _whose memorial\r\nis blessed_[1193] with us, whose presence is in honour with those who\r\nare above, grant to those who sing of thee that they may not be\r\ndeprived of their share in so great _an assembly_.[1194] O _great\r\nluminary_[1195] and _light_ that _shinest in darkness_,[1196]\r\nilluminating the prison, _making glad the city_[1197] by the rays of\r\nthy signs and merits, by the lustre of virtues put to flight from our\r\nhearts the darkness of vices. O _morning star_,[1198] more brilliant\r\nthan the rest because thou art nearer the day, more like to the sun,\r\ndeign to go before us, that we also may _walk in the light as children\r\nof light_, and _not_ children _of darkness_.[1199] O thou who art the\r\ndawn breaking into day upon the earth, but _the noon light_[1200]\r\nillumining the higher regions of heaven, receive us in the fellowship\r\nof light, by which illuminated thou sheddest light far without, and\r\nsweetly burnest within, by the gift of our Lord Jesus Christ, who with\r\nthe Father and the Holy Spirit reigneth One God, world without\r\nend.--Amen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1005] The evidence that this discourse was delivered on the day of\r\nMalachy's death is cumulative. (1) The opening words of § 1, and the\r\nclosing sentences of § 8 (note \"this day\"). (2) The statement in § 5,\r\n\"He said _to us_, 'With desire I have desired,'\" etc., implies that\r\nthose who tended Malachy in his sickness were present (see _Life_, §\r\n73). The first person plural in § 2 suggests the same conclusion. (3)\r\nIn § 6, \"dwelling among them _up to this time_\" implies that his death\r\nwas not long past. (4) The striking parallels with Letter iv.; for\r\nwhich see the notes on it. (5) The tone of the sermon--in marked\r\ncontrast to that of Sermon ii.--indicates that the community was\r\ncrushed with sorrow for a recent bereavement.

O hell, I will be thy\r\nbite.' Pierced, I say, by that hook, to the faithful who go through\r\nthe midst of thee thou offerest a broad and pleasant path-way into\r\nlife\" (Morison's translation). A very old metaphor. It is thus\r\nexplained by Rufinus (A.D. 400) in his Commentary on the Apostles'\r\nCreed (§ 16, Heurtley's translation): \"The object of that mystery of\r\nthe Incarnation ... was that the divine virtue of the Son of God, as\r\nthough it were a hook concealed beneath the form and fashion of human\r\nflesh, ... might lure on the prince of this world to a conflict, to\r\nwhom offering His flesh as a bait, His divinity underneath might\r\nsecure him, caught with a hook by the shedding of His immaculate\r\nblood.... As, if a fish seizes a baited hook, it not only does not\r\ntake the bait off the hook, but is drawn out of the water to be itself\r\nfood for others, so he who had the power of death seized the body of\r\nJesus in death, not being aware of the hook of divinity enclosed\r\nwithin it, but, having swallowed it, he was caught forthwith, and the\r\nbars of hell being burst asunder, he was drawn forth as it were from\r\nthe abyss to become food for others.\"\r\n\r\n[1040] Ps. lxxxix. 48 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[1041] 1 John iii. 8.\r\n\r\n[1042] 1 John ii. 13, 14.\r\n\r\n[1043] Matt. xxv. 41.\r\n\r\n[1044] Rev. xii. 12.\r\n\r\n[1045] Jer. l. 23.\r\n\r\n[1046] 1 Cor. xii. 7 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[1047] Matt. x. 25.\r\n\r\n[1048] Col. ii. 14.\r\n\r\n[1049] Rom. vi. 12.\r\n\r\n[1050] Rom. vii. 17.\r\n\r\n[1051] 1 Cor. xv. 55 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[1052] 1 Cor. xv. 26.\r\n\r\n[1053] Heb. ii. 14; Tobit ii. 8.\r\n\r\n[1054] Ps. cxxvii. 2, 3 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[1055] Ps. xxxiv. 21 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[1056] Ps. cxvi. 15.\r\n\r\n[1057] Communio for All Saints (Wisd. iii. 2, 3).\r\n\r\n[1058] Eph. ii. 19 (with variant).\r\n\r\n[1059] Ps. lxvi. 12.\r\n\r\n[1060] Hos. x. 15 (vg.: xi. 1).\r\n\r\n[1061] Luke xxii. 15.--See _Life_, § 73, where for \"he said to us\" we\r\nhave \"lifting up his eyes on _those who stood round him_, he said.\"\r\n\r\n[1062] Ps. lxvi. 12.\r\n\r\n[1063] Luke xvi. 24, 25.\r\n\r\n[1064] Ps. xlvi. 4.\r\n\r\n[1065] Ps. xxxvi. 8 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[1066] Ps. xxiii. 5 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[1067] Gen. ii. 9.\r\n\r\n[1068] 2 Cor. viii. 2.\r\n\r\n[1069] Rev. xxi. 25; xxii. 5.\r\n\r\n[1070] Eph. iii. 13.\r\n\r\n[1071] Ps. lxvi. 12.\r\n\r\n[1072] Ps. lxxxiii 12 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[1073] 1 Sam. xix. 5.\r\n\r\n[1074] See _Life_, §§ 19-31.\r\n\r\n[1075] See p. 82, n. 5.\r\n\r\n[1076] Ps. lxvi. 10, 11.\r\n\r\n[1077] _Examinauit, non exinaniuit._\r\n\r\n[1078] Ecclus. xlv. 4 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[1079] 1 John v. 4.\r\n\r\n[1080] Gal. vi. 1.\r\n\r\n[1081] 1 Kings xxi. 7 (vg.).\r\n\r\n[1082] Cp.

I put it in 1149 because of its striking coincidences with\r\nthe _Life_, which was written early in that year (see p. lxv). There\r\nis also a possible echo (§ 3) of _De Cons._ i. which belongs to the\r\nsame year (_P.L._ clxxxii. 723).

These charges refer\r\nprimarily to the dioceses of Armagh and Connor; but it is probable that\r\nthose dioceses were typical of many other districts throughout the\r\ncountry. If St. Bernard's statements are true of them, they may be\r\napplied with little reserve to the greater part of Ireland. Indeed he\r\nhimself gives us more than a hint that the abuses which he condemns were\r\nby no means confined to eastern Ulster (§ 19). It may be well,\r\ntherefore, to bring them together and to discuss them.\r\n\r\n1. There was no such thing as chanting at the canonical hours. In the\r\nwhole bishopric of Armagh \"there was none who could or would sing\" (§\r\n7). \"In the churches [of Connor] there was not heard the voice either of\r\npreacher or singer\" (§ 16). We may suspect that there is some\r\nexaggeration here; for if church song was absolutely unknown, how could\r\nMalachy have \"learnt singing in his youth\" (§ 7)? But that St. Bernard's\r\nremarks are substantially correct need not be questioned. He is not\r\nspeaking of the Irish Church as it was in its earlier period, but of its\r\nstate at the time when it had probably fallen to its lowest depth. His\r\nassertion, therefore, is not disposed of by references to the chanting\r\nat the funerals of Brian Boroimhe in 1014 and Maelsechlainn in 1022\r\n(O'Hanlon, p. 34). Indeed in the notices of those events in _A.F.M._\r\nthere is no express mention of ecclesiastical song.\r\n\r\n2. At Armagh Confession was not practised (§ 7); in the diocese of\r\nConnor \"nowhere could be found any who would either seek penance or\r\nimpose it\" (§ 16). It may be true that Confession had been much\r\nneglected among some classes of the people: Malachy on one occasion met\r\na woman who had never confessed (§ 54), and the very fact that he put\r\nthe question to her \"whether she had ever confessed her sins\" suggests\r\nthat she was not singular in this respect. But it is remarkable that the\r\n_anmchara_ (soul-friend), or Confessor, is frequently mentioned in Irish\r\nliterature. The obits of several persons to whom that title is given are\r\nrecorded in the Annals in the twelfth century. And penance is often\r\nalluded to in the obituary notices of distinguished persons, clerical\r\nand lay. In his sweeping statement St. Bernard may have had in mind some\r\ndifferences of method in penitential discipline between the Roman and\r\nIrish Churches.\r\n\r\n3. The sacrament of Confirmation was not celebrated, at any rate in\r\nArmagh (§ 7). This rite has always been used in the Irish Church, though\r\npossibly neglected locally at some periods. St. Patrick tells us that he\r\n\"confirmed in Christ\" those whom he had \"begotten to God\" (_Epistle_, 2;\r\ncp. _Confession_, 38, 51)--thus giving us one of the earliest instances\r\nin literature of the application to the rite of its present familiar\r\nname. But in his practice (_Epistle_, § 3), as in the Stowe Missal,\r\nabout A.D. 800 (ed. Sir G. F. Warner, vol. ii. p. 31), it seems to have\r\nconsisted of an anointing with chrism without laying on, or raising, of\r\nhand, or a direct prayer for the Holy Spirit. According to the Stowe\r\nMissal it was administered by a presbyter. It is improbable that St.\r\nBernard or his romanizing friends would recognize the rite so performed\r\nas true Confirmation.\r\n\r\n4. One of the things which was neglected at Armagh was \"the marriage\r\ncontract\" (§ 7). In the diocese of Connor there was \"no entry into\r\nlawful marriages\" (§ 16). By the labours of Malachy this abuse\r\ndisappeared. In Armagh he \"instituted anew\" the marriage contract; in\r\nConnor it came to pass that \"the celebration of marriage\" was revived (§\r\n17). Putting these statements together we may conclude that St.\r\nBernard's meaning is that marriages had ceased to be celebrated in the\r\nface of the Church, and that in consequence the vow of a life-long union\r\nwas often evaded. Now contemporary writers charge the Irish of this\r\nperiod with loose sexual morality, especially in regard of arbitrary\r\ndivorce, matrimony within the prohibited degrees, exchange of wives, and\r\nother breaches of the law of marriage. Such accusations are made, for\r\nexample, by Pope Gregory VII. (Haddan and Stubbs, _Eccl. Docs._ ii.\r\n160), Lanfranc (Ussher, 490; _P.L._ cl. 535, 536), Anselm (Ussher 521,\r\n523; _P.L._ clix. 173, 178) and Giraldus Cambrensis (_Gest._ ii. 14;\r\n_Top._ iii. 19). Their evidence is the more worthy of credence because\r\nthe usages to which they refer were characteristic of the Irish at an\r\nearlier period (_Encycl. of Religion and Ethics_, v. 456, 460), and\r\nmight be expected to recur in an age of spiritual decline. But both\r\nLanfranc and Anselm testify to the existence of marriage as an\r\ninstitution among the Irish. The former speaks of the divorce of a wife\r\n\"lawfully joined to her husband,\" and the latter uses terms of similar\r\nimport. So also does St. Bernard himself. His praise of Malachy's mother\r\n(_Life_, § 1) is inconceivable if she did not live in wedlock; and he\r\nexpressly states that eight \"metropolitans\" of Armagh were \"married men\"\r\n(§ 19). But if there was nevertheless a revival among large sections of\r\nthe people of pagan ideas of marriage, which tolerated polygamy,\r\nconcubinage, incest and easy termination of unions, it can be understood\r\nthat marriage in the face of the Church, which included a vow absolutely\r\nprohibitive of all these things, would be commonly avoided. Malachy's\r\nanxiety to restore the marriage ceremony was no doubt due to a desire\r\nto purge the nation of immoral customs of which St. Bernard makes no\r\nexpress mention. But, however that may be, we have contemporary native\r\nevidence that the rite of marriage had fallen into desuetude, and that\r\nMalachy was successful in his effort to restore it. For in the document\r\nquoted on p. 170, we are told that in a district which was part of the\r\ndiocese of Armagh when he was Cellach's vicar (_L.A.J._ iv. 37), and\r\nunder the rule of his patron, Donough O'Carroll, \"marriage was assented\r\nto.\"\r\n\r\n5. \"There was no giving of tithes or firstfruits,\" writes St. Bernard (§\r\n16). He is speaking of the diocese of Connor. But there is no doubt that\r\nthe remark might have been made of other districts. There was no such\r\ncustom as the payment of tithes in Ireland before the twelfth century.\r\nThey are first mentioned by Gilbert of Limerick, about 1108, in his _De\r\nStatu Ecclesiae_ (Ussher, 507); and they were enjoined at the Synods of\r\nKells in 1152 (Keating, iii. 315) and Cashel in 1172 (Can. 3, Giraldus,\r\n_Expug._, i. 35). From the document quoted above we learn that in Oriel,\r\nunder Donough O'Carroll, \"tithes were received\"--evidently a new impost.\r\n\r\n6. \"Ministers of the altar were exceeding few\" in the diocese of Connor\r\n(§ 16); and accordingly it is observed that Malachy provided his new\r\nchurches with clergy (§ 17). This is not proved, nor is it in any great\r\ndegree corroborated by the statement of _A.F.M._ (1148) that Malachy\r\n\"ordained bishops and priests and men of every order\"; but the parallel\r\nis perhaps worth noting.\r\n\r\n7. The voice of the preacher was not heard in the churches (§ 16). This\r\nstatement cannot, so far as I know, be checked.\r\n\r\n8. The same remark must be made about the statements that the people\r\nwould not come to church (§ 16), and that Malachy's exertions at length\r\ninduced them to do so (§ 17), though they are sufficiently probable.\r\n\r\n9. That \"churches were rebuilt\" (§ 17) cannot be questioned. No doubt\r\nthe monasteries of Bangor and Saul would be counted among the number. We\r\nhave explicit and independent evidence of the fact. The foundation of\r\nchurches and re-edifying of monasteries were a conspicuous feature of\r\nthe reign of Donough O'Carroll (see p. 170). And _A.F.M._ (1148) lay\r\ngreat stress on Malachy's activities in this direction. He \"consecrated\r\nmany churches and cemeteries,\" and \"founded churches and monasteries,\r\nfor by him was repaired every church in Ireland which had been consigned\r\nto decay and neglect, and they had been neglected from time remote.\"\r\n\r\nOn the whole it appears that St. Bernard's strictures are at least not\r\nwithout foundation in fact, in so far as they can be tested. But he can\r\nscarcely be acquitted of some measure of exaggeration in the rhetorical\r\npassages in which they occur.\r\n\r\n\r\nB.--The Hereditary Succession of the Coarbs Of Patrick.\r\n\r\n_Life_, §§ 19. 20, 30.\r\n\r\nThe assertions of St. Bernard in _Life_, § 19, concerning the coarbs of\r\nPatrick are controlled by _A.U._ The ninth predecessor of Cellach,\r\nCathasach II. (+957) is described in them (_s.a._ 956) as\r\n\"coarb of Patrick, learned bishop of the Goidhil.\" None of the following\r\neight is said to have been a bishop, though all are called coarbs of\r\nPatrick. Moreover Cellach himself was appointed abbot before he\r\n\"received holy orders,\" and the record of his ordination on St.\r\nAdamnan's Day (September 23) 1105, several weeks after his\r\n\"institution,\" seems to indicate that it was unusual for the abbots to\r\nbe ordained. All this corroborates the statement that his eight\r\npredecessors were \"without orders.\" It is true, indeed, that according\r\nto _A.F.M._ Amalgaid, one of the eight, anointed Maelsechlainn king of\r\nIreland, on his deathbed in 1022. But it does not follow from this that\r\nhe was a priest. In early times, as is well known, unction was\r\nadministered to the sick by laymen; and there appears to be no evidence\r\nthat this office was confined to the priesthood till well on in the\r\nninth century (_Dict. of Christ. Antiquities_, ii. 2004). It is at least\r\npossible that the older usage lingered on in Ireland to a much later\r\ndate than on the Continent. But the statement of _A.F.M._ as to the\r\nanointing of Maelsechlainn is not confirmed by the more reliable\r\nauthority of _A.U._\r\n\r\nThat at least five of the eight were, as St. Bernard says, \"married men\"\r\nis shown by the following table, compiled from _A.U._ and MacFirbis\r\n(_R.I.A._, MS. 23 P. 1, p. 308). The persons whose names are printed in\r\nitalics were coarbs of Patrick.\r\n\r\n                                    Cellach\r\n                                       |-------------|\r\n                                       |             |\r\n                                   Eochaid  _Dubdalethe II_ +998\r\n                                       |\r\n                                 _Mael Muire_ +1020\r\n                                       |\r\n               |--------------------------------------------------|\r\n               |                          |                       |\r\n          _Amalgaid_ +1049           _Dubdalethe III_ +1064     Aed +1042\r\n               |                          |\r\n               |                      Aed +1108\r\n               |\r\n      |----------------------------------------------------------|\r\n      |                     |                 |                  |\r\n  _Mael Isa_ +1091     _Domnall_ +1105    Dubesa +1078     Eochaid(?) +1038\r\n      |                     |\r\n  |-------------|     _Muirchertach_ (§ 20) +1134\r\n  |             |\r\n  Aed +1095  Flannacan +1113\r\n    |\r\n   |----------------------|\r\n   |                      |\r\n  _Cellach_ +1129     _Niall_ (§ 22) +1139\r\n\r\nThis table also confirms the statement that the abbots all belonged to\r\nthe same family, and so obtained office by a sort of hereditary right.\r\nSt. Bernard gives no hint which would enable us to identify this family.\r\nBut the genealogy given by MacFirbis enumerates the ancestors of Cellach\r\nin a direct line up to Fiachrach, son of Colla fo Crich, and is headed\r\n\"Genealogy of Ui Sinaich, _i.e._ the coarbs of Patrick.\" The Bodleian\r\nMS., Rawl. B. 502,[1201] has the same genealogy, and entitles it\r\n\"Genealogy of Clann Sinaich.\" The family then from which the abbots of\r\nArmagh were taken was the principal branch of that sept. From the\r\ngenealogy it appears that the sept was derived from Sinach, from whom\r\nthe fifth in descent was the Cellach whose name appears at the head of\r\nforegoing table.\r\n\r\nSt. Bernard represents Malachy to have said in 1132, when he was induced\r\nto oppose Murtough, that the system of hereditary succession had already\r\nlasted nearly two centuries (§ 20). This statement is in accord with\r\nknown facts. The genealogical table gives sufficient evidence that it\r\nbegan not earlier than the accession of Dubdalethe II. (965), and\r\ncontinued to the accession of Murtough. If there is no evidence that the\r\nthree predecessors of Dubdalethe were of the Clann Sinaich, neither is\r\nthere anything to disprove it. But their immediate predecessor, Joseph,\r\nwas certainly not of that sept; for _A.U._ (MS. A, 935) tells us that he\r\nwas of the Clann Gairb-gaela, and the list of coarbs in the Book of\r\nLeinster notes in addition that he came from Dalriada (_R.I.A._ xxxv.\r\n327, 359). Thus the succession cannot have been established before the\r\ndeath of Joseph (936). Hence it lasted for a period of between 167 and\r\n196 years. A period of 167 years, or a period of 196 years, might be\r\ndescribed as \"well-nigh two hundred years\" (_annos ferme ducentos_),\r\nthough the latter suits St. Bernard's language better than the former.\r\n\r\nBut how can this be harmonized with the statement that \"fifteen\r\nquasi-generations had passed in this wickedness\" (§ 19)? Obviously a\r\n\"quasi-generation\" is not a generation of human life: apart from the\r\nfacts just mentioned, the very word _quasi_ forbids the supposition.\r\nColgan (_Trias_, p. 301) suggested that the word indicates the period of\r\noffice of a coarb; and this is very probable. The figure of generations,\r\nso applied, is in line with St. Bernard's conception of a bishop as \"the\r\nseed\" of his predecessor (§ 34). But the first of a series of coarbs, of\r\nwhich Murtough was the fifteenth, was Maelcoba, the second predecessor\r\nof Joseph. So that, even on Colgan's hypothesis, St. Bernard's two\r\nstatements are irreconcilable. Yet it is difficult to believe that an\r\nerror so manifest was in his source. I suggest that he wrote \"fifteen\"\r\nin error for \"twelve\": in other words his document had _xii_, and he\r\nmisread it _xu_. The confusion of _u_ with _ii_ is very common in\r\nmanuscripts. If this explanation is accepted, St. Bernard's authority\r\nimplied that the hereditary succession was upheld without interruption\r\nfrom the death of Joseph to the accession of Murtough, which is\r\n\"well-nigh two hundred years.\"\r\n\r\nThis investigation may convince us that St. Bernard depended on an\r\nexcellent document for his knowledge of the history of Armagh. But he\r\ncertainly went astray in the interpretation of the document when he\r\nstyled the predecessors of Cellach metropolitans (see p. 45, n. 1). And\r\nhe goes further when he asserts that none were allowed to be bishops who\r\nwere not of their family (§ 19); thus leaving the impression that under\r\nthe rule of the eight lay abbots--that is, for a century and a\r\nhalf--Armagh was deprived of episcopal ministrations. But this is wholly\r\nunhistorical. The Ulster Annals mention six bishops of Armagh,\r\ncontemporary with the lay abbots. They seem to have followed one another\r\nin regular succession, and there is no indication that any one of them\r\nbelonged to the Clann Sinaich. They were no doubt monastic bishops, such\r\nas are found in the Irish Church from the sixth century onwards, who\r\nexercised the functions of their order at the bidding of the abbots.\r\nThey were probably not referred to in St. Bernard's document; and if\r\nthey were, one who had been trained in an entirely different\r\necclesiastical system would have been at a loss to understand their\r\nposition.\r\n\r\nThus we conclude that St. Bernard, in the passage which we are\r\nconsidering, used good material with conscientious care, but that he was\r\nmisled by lack of knowledge of Irish ecclesiastical methods. This result\r\nis important because it may apparently be applied to the whole of his\r\nmemoir of St. Malachy. His statements, as a rule, stand well the test of\r\ncomparison with the native records; and when he is at fault we can\r\nusually explain his errors as misunderstandings, due to ignorance of\r\nconditions of which he had no experience.\r\n\r\nSt. Bernard has been charged with gross exaggeration in another passage.\r\n\"A great miracle to-day,\" he writes (§ 30), \"is the extinction of that\r\ngeneration, so quickly wrought, especially for those who knew their\r\npride and power.\" It is an extravagant hyperbole to say that either the\r\nO'Neills, or the great tribe of the Oirgialla, represented to this day\r\nby the Maguires, the O'Hanlons and the MacMahons, was blotted out when\r\nthe _Life of St. Malachy_ was written. So argued some in the time of\r\nColgan (_Trias_, p. 302). But they misrepresented St. Bernard. The word\r\n\"generation\" obviously means in the sentence before us what it meant in\r\n§ 19 (\"adulterous generation\")--not an extensive tribe, nor even the\r\nClann Sinaich as a whole, but the branch of that sept which provided\r\nabbots for Armagh. The speedy extinction of a single family is not a\r\nthing incredible. And it is worthy of remark that neither the Clann\r\nSinaich, nor any person described as ua Sinaich or mac Sinaich is\r\nmentioned in the Annals after 1135 (see p. 58, n. 9).\r\n\r\nFor a more detailed treatment of the subjects discussed in this note\r\nreference may be made to _R.I.A._ xxxv. 232-238, 340-353.\r\n\r\n\r\nC.--Malachy's Contest with Niall.\r\n\r\n_Life_, §§ 22-31.\r\n\r\nThe narrative of the series of events between the death of Murtough and\r\nthe consecration of Gelasius, both in St. Bernard's _Life_ and in\r\n_A.F.M._, is obscure, and our two main authorities contradict each other\r\nin some particulars. In this note, I propose to attempt a reconstruction\r\nof the story.\r\n\r\n1. Among the native authorities _A.F.M._ stand alone in giving what\r\napproximates to a full account of the struggle between the rival abbots.\r\n_A.T._ record only three incidents; the _Chronicon Scotorum_ also\r\nrecords three incidents belonging to the year 1134, and then breaks off,\r\nto be resumed in 1142; in _A.U._ and _A.I._ there are hiatus which cover\r\nthe whole period; the other Annals ignore the events with which we are\r\nconcerned. The information supplied by _A.F.M._ runs as follows:\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1134.]\r\n\r\n(1) Malachy O'Morgair made a visitation of Munster and obtained his\r\ntribute.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(2) A chapel, which was erected by Cormac Mac Carthy, king of Cashel,\r\nwas consecrated by a synod of clergy assembled at that place.\r\n\r\n(3) Murtough died 17 September.\r\n\r\n(4) Niall was installed in the coarbate of Patrick.\r\n\r\n(5) A change of abbots at Armagh, _i.e._ Malachy O'Morgair in place of\r\nNiall.\r\n\r\n(6) Malachy afterwards made a visitation of Munster and received his\r\ntribute.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1135.]\r\n\r\n(7) Flann Ua Sinaich, keeper of the Staff of Jesus, died after good\r\npenance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(8) Malachy O'Morgair purchased the Staff of Jesus, and took it from its\r\ncave 7 July.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1136.]\r\n\r\n(9) A visitation of Munster was made by Malachy O'Morgair, coarb of\r\nPatrick.\r\n\r\n(10) A change of abbots at Armagh, _i.e._ Niall in place of Malachy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n(11) Malachy O'Morgair resigned the coarbate of Patrick for the sake of\r\nGod.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1137.]\r\n\r\n(12) A change of abbots at Armagh, _i.e._ the erenach (_recte_ abbot) of\r\nDerry in place of Niall.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n[Sidenote: 1138.]\r\n\r\n(13) Christian O'Morgair died.\r\n\r\n_A.T._ record the second and fifth of the above events, and subjoin to\r\nthe latter notice the passage quoted p. 51, n. 4. The _Chronicon\r\nScotorum_ records, the second, third and fifth.\r\n\r\nThere is obvious confusion in the narrative of the Masters. They put the\r\ndeath of Christian O'Morgair under 1138, which is a year too early (see\r\np. 66, n. 1), and they credit Malachy with having made three visitations\r\nof Munster within three years, which he is very unlikely to have done.\r\nBut it is to be observed that the notices of the visitations are not\r\nmere repetitions, for they differ from each other verbally. Thus we may\r\nsuspect that the Masters copied those entries from three different\r\nsources, and that they refer to the same visitation, which, in at least\r\none of the sources, appeared under the wrong year. Now the consecutive\r\nsentences 9, 10 are probably connected with each other: the absence of\r\nMalachy in Munster would give his opponents opportunity to reinstate his\r\nrival. In like manner entries 1, 2 (not consecutive) may be connected.\r\nIt would not be surprising if Malachy, even at some risk to the security\r\nof his tenure of the abbacy at Armagh, took part in the consecration of\r\nhis patron's church at Cashel. And it may be added that he would not\r\nimprobably make this visit to the south the occasion of a circuit in\r\nMunster. The visitation, on that hypothesis, must have taken place in\r\n1134 or early in 1135. Again, the note of time in entry 6 implies that\r\nit was made not very long after the appointment of Malachy, recorded in\r\nthe immediately preceding entry 5. Finally, entry 8 mentions an event\r\nwhich must have greatly strengthened his hands. Having possessed himself\r\nof the more important and revered of the abbatial insignia he was at\r\nlength more than a match for his antagonist. Probably, therefore, the\r\nrestoration of Niall (10) should be placed rather before than after it.\r\nFor these reasons we seem to be justified in placing the recorded\r\nincidents in the following order. When Malachy secured possession of the\r\nsee (5) he remained long enough in Armagh to establish himself in the\r\nabbacy. During this time may have occurred the abortive conspiracy\r\nagainst him related in _A.T._, but not alluded to in _A.F.M._ He then\r\nwent to Cashel for the consecration of the Chapel (2), and held his\r\nvisitation of Munster (1, 6, 9). When he returned he found that Niall\r\nhad once more entered Armagh (10). By July 1135 the power of his rival\r\nhad considerably decreased, and Malachy got possession of the Staff of\r\nJesus (8). Finally he resigned his office (11) and Gelasius was\r\nappointed to it (12). If this is a true account of the course of events,\r\none statement of the Annals needs correction. They tell us that Gelasius\r\nsucceeded Niall; on our hypothesis he succeeded Malachy. But that the\r\nMasters should have substituted the former for the latter was to be\r\nexpected; for according to their previous (as I believe misplaced)\r\nstatement Niall, not Malachy, was in possession in the latter part of\r\n1136.\r\n\r\n2. We now turn to St. Bernard's narrative of these transactions.\r\nSections 22 and 23 present no difficulty. They are simply an\r\namplification, with differences in detail, of what we learn from _A.T._\r\nIn the early part of § 24 it is stated that Malachy remained in Armagh\r\nafter the king, with whose aid he had \"ascended the chair of Patrick,\"\r\nhad returned home; and in the succeeding narrative it is implied that he\r\nnever left it till he went to Down. That is to say, the visitation of\r\nMunster is ignored. This need cause no surprise. It is quite possible\r\nthat St. Bernard had never heard of it. Again, there is no explicit\r\nmention of the reinstatement of Niall. But it seems to be implied in §\r\n24 (see p. 53, n. 9). The whole story becomes more intelligible if we\r\nassume that Niall was in possession for a short time, and then fled, but\r\ncontinued to exercise his functions outside the city, as Malachy himself\r\nhad done in a previous period (§ 21). If we suppose that the visit to\r\nMunster took place shortly after the episode of § 23 we can explain the\r\nonly difficulty in the narrative, the return of Niall after he had been\r\ndriven out. The latter part of § 24 seems to intimate a lessening of\r\nopposition to Malachy's rule. The whole passage, §§ 24-27, with the\r\nexception of the last two sentences of § 27, must relate to the period\r\nbefore July 1135, inasmuch as Niall is represented as carrying about\r\nwith him the Staff of Jesus as well as the Book of Armagh.\r\n\r\nUp to this point St. Bernard's narrative harmonizes admirably with the\r\nstory as it has been reconstructed above from the Annals. But we must\r\ncarry our comparison of the two accounts a little further. They agree in\r\ngiving 1137 as the date of the appointment of Gelasius as coarb of\r\nPatrick; but while St. Bernard puts the resignation of Malachy in the\r\nsame year the Masters record it under 1136 (p. 61, n. 7). Now their\r\nphrase (11), that he \"resigned for the sake of God,\" in its present\r\ncontext (10) can have only one meaning. Malachy, seeing that his contest\r\nwith Niall was hopeless, determined to retire rather than continue the\r\nstrife, and left Niall in possession. But apart from entry 10, which\r\nseems to have been misplaced, the words have no such implication, and\r\nare in harmony with the reason given by St. Bernard for Malachy's return\r\nto his former diocese (§§ 20, 21). Since the dates of the Masters for\r\nthis period are already suspect we need not hesitate to follow St.\r\nBernard's guidance here. But we may go further. The annalists were\r\ncompelled, if they would be consistent, to suppose that there was a\r\nconsiderable interval between the retirement of Malachy and the\r\naccession of Gelasius. How was it possible that when Niall had finally\r\nrouted his formidable rival, who was in possession of the Staff of\r\nJesus, another should at once step in and, apparently without any\r\ndifficulty, deprive him of the fruits of his victory? The difficulty is\r\nincreased if we accept the statement of St. Bernard--not contradicted by\r\nthe Annals, and not easy to dispute--that Gelasius was nominated by\r\nMalachy himself, and was therefore presumably favourable to his cause.\r\nThus we perceive that there was good reason that the annalists should\r\nseparate the two events as far as possible, by antedating Malachy's\r\nresignation, and by connecting it rather with Niall's restoration than\r\nwith the appointment of Gelasius.\r\n\r\n3. In weighing the respective claims of St. Bernard and the annalists to\r\ncredence in this part of Malachy's life it is well to remember that of\r\nit St. Bernard may be assumed to have had full and first-hand\r\ninformation. The main facts were probably communicated to him by\r\nMalachy himself, though some particulars were no doubt added by other\r\nIrish informants. It is true, we must also allow for bias on St.\r\nBernard's part in favour of his friend. Such bias in fact displays\r\nitself in §§ 25, 26. But bias, apart from sheer dishonesty, could not\r\ndistort the whole narrative, as it certainly must have been distorted in\r\nthe _Life_, if the narrative of _A.F.M._ is to be accepted as it stands.\r\n\r\n4. It is important to observe that in the earlier stages of Malachy's\r\nconflict with Niall the lord of Oriel was Conor O'Loughlin, who was\r\napparently not friendly to the reformers of the Irish Church (cp. §§ 18,\r\n20, p. 40, n. 2, and p. 46, n. 5). No doubt his defeat by O'Brien and\r\nMac Carthy in 1134 (p. 43, n. 5) made him a less ardent supporter of\r\nNiall than he had been of Murtough; but it is not likely that he\r\nentirely discouraged his attempts to seize the abbacy. The ultimate\r\nsuccess of Malachy was in fact probably due to O'Loughlin's murder at\r\nthe end of May 1136 and the rise to power of Donough O'Carroll (see p.\r\n58, n. 11), his successor in the kingdom of Oriel. St. Bernard never\r\nmentions O'Carroll by name, though he possibly alludes to him in one\r\npassage (§ 28: see note there). But we may infer from other sources that\r\nhe was a zealous friend and helper of Malachy. The most important of\r\nthese is a contemporary document, part of which has been copied on a\r\nblank page of a fourteenth-century Antiphonary of Armagh (T.C.D. ms. B.\r\n1. 1.) opposite the first page of the Calendar. Unfortunately the scribe\r\nlaid down his pen at the end of a line and in the middle of a sentence.\r\nThe document was first published by Petrie (p. 389) with a translation.\r\nAs it is referred to several times in the notes to the _Life_ it may be\r\nwell to print here, with a few slight alterations, Dr. Whitley Stokes'\r\nrevised rendering (Gorman, p. xx.).\r\n\r\n\"_Kalend.

It is this illustrious king who\r\nfounded the entire monastery both [as to] stone and wood, and gave\r\nterritory and land to it for the prosperity of his soul in honour of\r\nPaul and Peter. By him the church throughout the land of Oirgialla was\r\nreformed, and a regular bishopric was made, and the church was placed\r\nunder the jurisdiction of the bishop. In his time tithes were received\r\nand marriage was assented to, and churches were founded and temples and\r\nbell-houses [round towers] were made, and monasteries of monks and\r\ncanons and nuns were re-edified, and _nemheds_ were made. These are\r\nespecially the works which he performed for the prosperity [of his soul]\r\nand reign in the land of Oirgialla, namely, the monastery of monks on\r\nthe banks of the Boyne [as to] stone and wood, implements and books, and\r\nterritory and land, in which there are one hundred monks and three\r\nhundred conventuals, and the monastery of canons of Termann Feichin, and\r\nthe monastery of nuns, and the great church of Termann Feichin, and the\r\nchurch of Lepadh Feichin, and the church of....\"\r\n\r\nO'Carroll, then, was an ardent supporter of Malachy. Is it likely that\r\nafter his long struggle to secure the Chair of Patrick, and when he was\r\nin actual possession of it, Malachy should voluntarily surrender his\r\nclaim to Niall at the very moment when the new king of Oriel had come to\r\nhis aid? Yet, unless we are prepared to place his resignation before\r\nJune 1136, that is the assumption we must make if we adhere to the\r\nstatements of _A.F.M._\r\n\r\n5. There are other documents of high authority which must be taken into\r\naccount: the contemporary record of the succession of coarbs of Patrick\r\nin the Book of Leinster, and the copy of a similar record in the Yellow\r\nBook of Lecan. The former of these seems to have been written by a\r\npartizan of Malachy, since it ignores Murtough. The latter assigns to\r\nthat abbot a rule of three years, in agreement with St. Bernard (§§ 20,\r\n21). But neither of them so much as mentions Niall; and both make\r\nGelasius the successor of Malachy. Thus they contradict _A.F.M._ and\r\ncorroborate the narrative of St. Bernard.
