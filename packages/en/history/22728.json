Nor can there be any doubt\r\nthat, when he started on board the _Beagle_, such opinions as he had\r\nwere on the side of immutability. When therefore did the current of his\r\nthoughts begin to set in the direction of Evolution?\r\n\r\n     {1} See the extracts in _Life and Letters of Charles Darwin_, ii.\r\n     p. 5.\r\n\r\nWe have first to consider the factors that made for such a change. On\r\nhis departure in 1831, Henslow gave him vol. I. of Lyell's _Principles_,\r\nthen just published, with the warning that he was not to believe what he\r\nread{2}. But believe he did, and it is certain (as Huxley has forcibly\r\npointed out{3}) that the doctrine of uniformitarianism when applied to\r\nBiology leads of necessity to Evolution. If the extermination of a\r\nspecies is no more catastrophic than the natural death of an individual,\r\nwhy should the birth of a species be any more miraculous than the birth\r\nof an individual? It is quite clear that this thought was vividly\r\npresent to Darwin when he was writing out his early thoughts in the 1837\r\nNote Book{4}:--\r\n\r\n\"Propagation explains why modern animals same type as extinct, which is\r\nlaw almost proved. They die, without they change, like golden pippins;\r\nit is a _generation of species_ like generation _of individuals_.\"\r\n\r\n\"If _species_ generate other _species_ their race is not utterly cut\r\noff.\"\r\n\r\n     {2} The second volume,--especially important in regard to\r\n     Evolution,--reached him in the autumn of 1832, as Prof. Judd has\r\n     pointed out in his most interesting paper in _Darwin and Modern\r\n     Science_. Cambridge, 1909.\r\n\r\n     {3} Obituary Notice of C. Darwin, _Proc. R. Soc._ vol. 44.\r\n     Reprinted in Huxley's _Collected Essays_. See also _Life and\r\n     Letters of C. Darwin_, ii. p. 179.\r\n\r\n     {4} See the extracts in the _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 5.\r\n\r\nThese quotations show that he was struggling to see in the origin of\r\nspecies a process just as scientifically comprehensible as the birth of\r\nindividuals. They show, I think, that he recognised the two things not\r\nmerely as similar but as identical.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to know how soon the ferment of uniformitarianism began\r\nto work, but it is fair to suspect that in 1832 he had already begun to\r\nsee that mutability was the logical conclusion of Lyell's doctrine,\r\nthough this was not acknowledged by Lyell himself.\r\n\r\nThere were however other factors of change. In his Autobiography{5} he\r\nwrote:--\"During the voyage of the _Beagle_ I had been deeply impressed\r\nby discovering in the Pampean formation great fossil animals covered\r\nwith armour like that on the existing armadillos; secondly, by the\r\nmanner in which closely allied animals replace one another in proceeding\r\nsouthward over the Continent; and thirdly, by the South American\r\ncharacter of most of the productions of the Galapagos archipelago, and\r\nmore especially by the manner in which they differ slightly on each\r\nisland of the group; none of the islands appearing to be very ancient in\r\na geological sense. It was evident that such facts as these, as well as\r\nmany others, could only be explained on the supposition that species\r\ngradually become modified; and the subject haunted me.\"\r\n\r\n     {5} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 82.\r\n\r\nAgain we have to ask: how soon did any of these influences produce an\r\neffect on Darwin's mind? Different answers have been attempted.\r\nHuxley{6} held that these facts could not have produced their essential\r\neffect until the voyage had come to an end, and the \"relations of the\r\nexisting with the extinct species and of the species of the different\r\ngeographical areas with one another were determined with some\r\nexactness.\" He does not therefore allow that any appreciable advance\r\ntowards evolution was made during the actual voyage of the _Beagle_.\r\n\r\n     {6} _Obituary Notice_, _loc. cit._\r\n\r\nProfessor Judd{7} takes a very different view. He holds that November\r\n1832 may be given with some confidence as the \"date at which Darwin\r\ncommenced that long series of observations and reasonings which\r\neventually culminated in the preparation of the _Origin of Species_.\"\r\n\r\n     {7} _Darwin and Modern Science._\r\n\r\nThough I think these words suggest a more direct and continuous march\r\nthan really existed between fossil-collecting in 1832 and writing the\r\n_Origin of Species_ in 1859, yet I hold that it was during the voyage\r\nthat Darwin's mind began to be turned in the direction of Evolution, and\r\nI am therefore in essential agreement with Prof. Judd, although I lay\r\nmore stress than he does on the latter part of the voyage.\r\n\r\nLet us for a moment confine our attention to the passage, above quoted,\r\nfrom the Autobiography and to what is said in the Introduction to the\r\n_Origin_, Ed. i., viz. \"When on board H.M.S. 'Beagle,' as naturalist, I\r\nwas much struck with certain facts in the distribution of the\r\ninhabitants of South America, and in the geological relations of the\r\npresent to the past inhabitants of that continent.\" These words,\r\noccurring where they do, can only mean one thing,--namely that the facts\r\nsuggested an evolutionary interpretation. And this being so it must be\r\ntrue that his thoughts _began to flow in the direction of Descent_ at\r\nthis early date.\r\n\r\nI am inclined to think that the \"new light which was rising in his\r\nmind{8}\" had not yet attained any effective degree of steadiness or\r\nbrightness. I think so because in his Pocket Book under the date 1837 he\r\nwrote, \"In July opened first note-book on 'transmutation of species.'\r\nHad been greatly struck _from about month of previous March_{9} on\r\ncharacter of South American fossils, and species on Galapagos\r\nArchipelago. These facts origin (_especially latter_), of all my views.\"\r\nBut he did not visit the Galapagos till 1835 and I therefore find it\r\nhard to believe that his evolutionary views attained any strength or\r\npermanence until at any rate quite late in the voyage. The Galapagos\r\nfacts are strongly against Huxley's view, for Darwin's attention was\r\n\"thoroughly aroused{10}\" by comparing the birds shot by himself and by\r\nothers on board. The case must have struck him at once,--without waiting\r\nfor accurate determinations,--as a microcosm of evolution.\r\n\r\n     {8} Huxley, _Obituary_, p. xi.\r\n\r\n     {9} In this citation the italics are mine.\r\n\r\n     {10} _Journal of Researches_, Ed. 1860, p. 394.\r\n\r\nIt is also to be noted, in regard to the remains of extinct animals,\r\nthat, in the above quotation from his Pocket Book, he speaks of March\r\n1837 as the time at which he began to be \"greatly struck on character of\r\nSouth American fossils,\" which suggests at least that the impression\r\nmade in 1832 required reinforcement before a really powerful effect was\r\nproduced.\r\n\r\nWe may therefore conclude, I think, that the evolutionary current in my\r\nfather's thoughts had continued to increase in force from 1832 onwards,\r\nbeing especially reinforced at the Galapagos in 1835 and again in 1837\r\nwhen he was overhauling the results, mental and material, of his\r\ntravels. And that when the above record in the Pocket Book was made he\r\nunconsciously minimised the earlier beginnings of his theorisings, and\r\nlaid more stress on the recent thoughts which were naturally more vivid\r\nto him. In his letter{11} to Otto Zacharias (1877) he wrote, \"On my\r\nreturn home in the autumn of 1836, I immediately began to prepare my\r\nJournal for publication, and then saw how many facts indicated the\r\ncommon descent of species.\" This again is evidence in favour of the view\r\nthat the later growths of his theory were the essentially important\r\nparts of its development.\r\n\r\n     {11} F. Darwin's _Life of Charles Darwin_ (in one volume), 1892, p.\r\n     166.\r\n\r\nIn the same letter to Zacharias he says, \"When I was on board the\r\n_Beagle_ I believed in the permanence of species, but as far as I can\r\nremember vague doubts occasionally flitted across my mind.\" Unless Prof.\r\nJudd and I are altogether wrong in believing that late or early in the\r\nvoyage (it matters little which) a definite approach was made to the\r\nevolutionary standpoint, we must suppose that in 40 years such advance\r\nhad shrunk in his recollection to the dimensions of \"vague doubts.\" The\r\nletter to Zacharias shows I think some forgetting of the past where the\r\nauthor says, \"But I did not become convinced that species were mutable\r\nuntil, I think, two or three years had elapsed.\" It is impossible to\r\nreconcile this with the contents of the evolutionary Note Book of 1837.\r\nI have no doubt that in his retrospect he felt that he had not been\r\n\"convinced that species were mutable\" until he had gained a clear\r\nconception of the mechanism of natural selection, _i.e._ in 1838-9.\r\n\r\nBut even on this last date there is some room, not for doubt, but for\r\nsurprise. The passage in the Autobiography{12} is quite clear, namely\r\nthat in October 1838 he read Malthus's _Essay on the principle of\r\nPopulation_ and \"being well prepared to appreciate the struggle for\r\nexistence ..., it at once struck me that under these circumstances\r\nfavourable variations would tend to be preserved, and unfavourable ones\r\nto be destroyed. The result of this would be the formation of new\r\nspecies. Here then I had at last got a theory by which to work.\"\r\n\r\n     {12} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 83.\r\n\r\nIt is surprising that Malthus should have been needed to give him the\r\nclue, when in the Note Book of 1837 there should occur--however\r\nobscurely expressed--the following forecast{13} of the importance of the\r\nsurvival of the fittest. \"With respect to extinction, we can easily see\r\nthat a variety of the ostrich (Petise{14}), may not be well adapted, and\r\nthus perish out; or on the other hand, like Orpheus{15}, being\r\nfavourable, many might be produced. This requires the principle that the\r\npermanent variations produced by confined breeding and changing\r\ncircumstances are continued and produce<d> according to the adaptation of\r\nsuch circumstances, and therefore that death of species is a consequence\r\n(contrary to what would appear in America) of non-adaptation of\r\ncircumstances.\"\r\n\r\n     {13} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 8.\r\n\r\n     {14} Avestruz Petise, _i.e. Rhea Darwini_.\r\n\r\n     {15} A bird.\r\n\r\nI can hardly doubt, that with his knowledge of the interdependence of\r\norganisms and the tyranny of conditions, his experience would have\r\ncrystallized out into \"a theory by which to work\" even without the aid\r\nof Malthus.\r\n\r\nIn my father's Autobiography{16} he writes, \"In June 1842 I first\r\nallowed myself the satisfaction of writing a very brief abstract of my\r\ntheory in pencil in 35 pages; and this was enlarged during the summer of\r\n1844 into one of 230 pages{17}, which I had fairly copied out and still\r\npossess.\" These two Essays, of 1842 and 1844, are now printed under the\r\ntitle _The Foundations of the Origin of Species_.\r\n\r\n     {16} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 84.\r\n\r\n     {17} It contains as a fact 231 pp. It is a strongly bound folio,\r\n     interleaved with blank pages, as though for notes and additions.\r\n     His own MS. from which it was copied contains 189 pp.\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that in the above passage he does not mention the MS.\r\nof 1842 as being in existence, and when I was at work on _Life and\r\nLetters_ I had not seen it. It only came to light after my mother's\r\ndeath in 1896 when the house at Down was vacated. The MS. was hidden in\r\na cupboard under the stairs which was not used for papers of any value,\r\nbut rather as an overflow for matter which he did not wish to destroy.\r\n\r\nThe statement in the Autobiography that the MS. was written in 1842\r\nagrees with an entry in my fathers Diary:--\r\n\r\n\"1842. May 18th went to Maer. June 15th to Shrewsbury, and on 18th to\r\nCapel Curig.... During my stay at Maer and Shrewsbury (five years after\r\ncommencement) wrote pencil sketch of my species theory.\" Again in a\r\nletter to Lyell (June 18, 1858) he speaks of his \"MS. sketch written out\r\nin 1842{18}.\" In the _Origin of Species_, Ed. i. p. 1, he speaks of\r\nbeginning his speculations in 1837 and of allowing himself to draw up\r\nsome \"short notes\" after \"five years' work,\" _i.e._ in 1842. So far\r\nthere seems no doubt as to 1842 being the date of the first sketch; but\r\nthere is evidence in favour of an earlier date{19}. Thus across the\r\nTable of Contents of the bound copy of the 1844 MS. is written in my\r\nfather's hand \"This was sketched in 1839.\" Again in a letter to Mr\r\nWallace{20} (Jan. 25, 1859) he speaks of his own contributions to the\r\nLinnean paper{21} of July 1, 1858, as \"written in 1839, now just twenty\r\nyears ago.\" This statement as it stands is undoubtedly incorrect, since\r\nthe extracts are from the MS. of 1844, about the date of which no doubt\r\nexists; but even if it could be supposed to refer to the 1842 Essay, it\r\nmust, I think, be rejected. I can only account for his mistake by the\r\nsupposition that my father had in mind the date (1839) at which the\r\nframework of his theory was laid down. It is worth noting that in his\r\nAutobiography (p. 88) he speaks of the time \"about 1839, when the theory\r\nwas clearly conceived.\" However this may be there can be no doubt that\r\n1842 is the correct date. Since the publication of _Life and Letters_ I\r\nhave gained fresh evidence on this head. A small packet containing 13\r\npp. of MS. came to light in 1896. On the outside is written \"First\r\nPencil Sketch of Species Theory. Written at Maer and Shrewsbury during\r\nMay and June 1842.\" It is not however written in pencil, and it consists\r\nof a single chapter on _The Principles of Variation in Domestic\r\nOrganisms_. A single unnumbered page is written in pencil, and is headed\r\n\"Maer, May 1842, useless\"; it also bears the words \"This page was\r\nthought of as introduction.\" It consists of the briefest sketch of the\r\ngeological evidence for evolution, together with words intended as\r\nheadings for discussion,--such as \"Affinity,--unity of type,--foetal\r\nstate,--abortive organs.\"\r\n\r\n     {18} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 116.\r\n\r\n     {19} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 10.\r\n\r\n     {20} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 146.\r\n\r\n     {21} _J. Linn. Soc. Zool._ iii. p. 45.\r\n\r\nThe back of this \"useless\" page is of some interest, although it does\r\nnot bear on the question of date,--the matter immediately before us.\r\n\r\nIt seems to be an outline of the Essay or sketch of 1842, consisting of\r\nthe titles of the three chapters of which it was to have consisted.\r\n\r\n\"I. The Principles of Var. in domestic organisms.\r\n\r\n\"II. The possible and probable application of these same principles to\r\nwild animals and consequently the possible and probable production of\r\nwild races, analogous to the domestic ones of plants and animals.\r\n\r\n\"III. The reasons for and against believing that such races have really\r\nbeen produced, forming what are called species.\"\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that Chapter III as originally designed corresponds to\r\nPart II (p. 22) of the Essay of 1842, which is (p. 7) defined by the\r\nauthor as discussing \"whether the characters and relations of animated\r\nthings are such as favour the idea of wild species being races descended\r\nfrom a common stock.\" Again at p. 23 the author asks \"What then is the\r\nevidence in favour of it (the theory of descent) and what the evidence\r\nagainst it.\" The generalised section of his Essay having been originally\r\nChapter III{22} accounts for the curious error which occurs in pp. 18\r\nand 22 where the second Part of the Essay is called Part III.\r\n\r\n     {22} It is evident that _Parts_ and _Chapters_ were to some extent\r\n     interchangeable in the author's mind, for p. 1 (of the MS. we have\r\n     been discussing) is headed in ink Chapter I, and afterwards altered\r\n     in pencil to Part I.\r\n\r\nThe division of the Essay into two parts is maintained in the enlarged\r\nEssay of 1844, in which he writes: \"The Second Part of this work is\r\ndevoted to the general consideration of how far the general economy of\r\nnature justifies or opposes the belief that related species and genera\r\nare descended from common stocks.\" The _Origin of Species_ however is\r\nnot so divided.\r\n\r\nWe may now return to the question of the date of the Essay. I have found\r\nadditional evidence in favour of 1842 in a sentence written on the back\r\nof the Table of Contents of the 1844 MS.--not the copied version but the\r\noriginal in my father's writing: \"This was written and enlarged from a\r\nsketch in 37 pages{23} in Pencil (the latter written in summer of 1842\r\nat Maer and Shrewsbury) in beginning of 1844, and finished it <_sic_> in\r\nJuly; and finally corrected the copy by Mr Fletcher in the last week in\r\nSeptember.\" On the whole it is impossible to doubt that 1842 is the date\r\nof the earlier of the two Essays.\r\n\r\n     {23} On p. 23 of the MS. of the _Foundations_ is a reference to the\r\n     \"back of p. 21 bis\": this suggests that additional pages had been\r\n     interpolated in the MS. and that it may once have had 37 in place\r\n     of 35 pp.\r\n\r\nThe sketch of 1842 is written on bad paper with a soft pencil, and is in\r\nmany parts extremely difficult to read, many of the words ending in mere\r\nscrawls and being illegible without context. It is evidently written\r\nrapidly, and is in his most elliptical style, the articles being\r\nfrequently omitted, and the sentences being loosely composed and often\r\nillogical in structure. There is much erasure and correction, apparently\r\nmade at the moment of writing, and the MS. does not give the impression\r\nof having been re-read with any care. The whole is more like hasty\r\nmemoranda of what was clear to himself, than material for the convincing\r\nof others.\r\n\r\nMany of the pages are covered with writing on the back, an instance of\r\nhis parsimony in the matter of paper{24}. This matter consists partly of\r\npassages marked for insertion in the text, and these can generally\r\n(though by no means always) be placed where he intended. But he also\r\nused the back of one page for a preliminary sketch to be rewritten on a\r\nclean sheet. These parts of the work have been printed as footnotes, so\r\nas to allow what was written on the front of the pages to form a\r\ncontinuous text. A certain amount of repetition is unavoidable, but much\r\nof what is written on the backs of the pages is of too much interest to\r\nbe omitted. Some of the matter here given in footnotes may, moreover,\r\nhave been intended as the final text and not as the preliminary sketch.\r\n\r\n     {24} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 153.\r\n\r\nWhen a word cannot be deciphered, it is replaced by:--<illegible>, the\r\nangular brackets being, as already explained, a symbol for an insertion\r\nby the editor. More commonly, however, the context makes the\r\ninterpretation of a word reasonably sure although the word is not\r\nstrictly legible. Such words are followed by an inserted mark of\r\ninterrogation <?>. Lastly, words inserted by the editor, of which the\r\nappropriateness is doubtful, are printed thus <variation?>.\r\n\r\nTwo kinds of erasure occur in the MS. of 1842. One by vertical lines\r\nwhich seem to have been made when the 35 pp. MS. was being expanded into\r\nthat of 1844, and merely imply that such a page is done with: and\r\nsecondly the ordinary erasures by horizontal lines. I have not been\r\nquite consistent in regard to these: I began with the intention of\r\nprinting (in square brackets) all such erasures. But I ultimately found\r\nthat the confusion introduced into the already obscure sentences was\r\ngreater than any possible gain; and many such erasures are altogether\r\nomitted. In the same way I have occasionally omitted hopelessly obscure\r\nand incomprehensible fragments, which if printed would only have\r\nburthened the text with a string of <illegible>s and queried words. Nor have I\r\nprinted the whole of what is written on the backs of the pages, where it\r\nseemed to me that nothing but unnecessary repetition would have been the\r\nresult.\r\n\r\nIn the matter of punctuation I have given myself a free hand. I may no\r\ndoubt have misinterpreted the author's meaning in so doing, but without\r\nsuch punctuation, the number of repellantly crabbed sentences would have\r\nbeen even greater than at present. In dealing with the Essay of 1844, I\r\nhave corrected some obvious slips without indicating such alterations,\r\nbecause the MS. being legible, there is no danger of changing the\r\nauthor's meaning.\r\n\r\nThe sections into which the Essay of 1842 is divided are in the original\r\nmerely indicated by a gap in the MS. or by a line drawn across the page.\r\nNo titles are given except in the case of § VIII.; and § II. is the only\r\nsection which has a number in the original. I might equally well have\r\nmade sections of what are now subsections, _e.g. Natural Selection_ p.\r\n7, or _Extermination_ p. 28. But since the present sketch is the germ of\r\nthe Essay of 1844, it seemed best to preserve the identity between the\r\ntwo works, by using such of the author's divisions as correspond to the\r\nchapters of the enlarged version of 1844. The geological discussion with\r\nwhich Part II begins corresponds to two chapters (IV and V) of the 1844\r\nEssay. I have therefore described it as §§ IV. and V., although I cannot\r\nmake sure of its having originally consisted of two sections. With this\r\nexception the ten sections of the Essay of 1842 correspond to the ten\r\nchapters of that of 1844.\r\n\r\nThe _Origin of Species_ differs from the sketch of 1842 in not being\r\ndivided into two parts. But the two volumes resemble each other in\r\ngeneral structure. Both begin with a statement of what may be called the\r\nmechanism of evolution,--variation and selection: in both the argument\r\nproceeds from the study of domestic organisms to that of animals and\r\nplants in a state of nature. This is followed in both by a discussion of\r\nthe _Difficulties on Theory_ and this by a section _Instinct_ which in\r\nboth cases is treated as a special case of difficulty.\r\n\r\nIf I had to divide the _Origin_ (first edition) into two parts without\r\nany knowledge of earlier MS., I should, I think, make Part II begin with\r\nCh. VI, _Difficulties on Theory_. A possible reason why this part of the\r\nargument is given in Part I of the Essay of 1842 may be found in the\r\nEssay of 1844, where it is clear that the chapter on instinct is placed\r\nin Part I because the author thought it of importance to show that\r\nheredity and variation occur in mental attributes. The whole question is\r\nperhaps an instance of the sort of difficulty which made the author give\r\nup the division of his argument into two Parts when he wrote the\r\n_Origin_. As matters stand §§ IV. and V. of the 1842 Essay correspond to\r\nthe geological chapters, IX and X, in the _Origin_. From this point\r\nonwards the material is grouped in the same order in both works:\r\ngeographical distribution; affinities and classification; unity of type\r\nand morphology; abortive or rudimentary organs; recapitulation and\r\nconclusion.\r\n\r\nIn enlarging the Essay of 1842 into that of 1844, the author retained\r\nthe sections of the sketch as chapters in the completer presentment. It\r\nfollows that what has been said of the relation of the earlier Essay to\r\nthe _Origin_ is generally true of the 1844 Essay. In the latter,\r\nhowever, the geological discussion is, clearly instead of obscurely,\r\ndivided into two chapters, which correspond roughly with Chapters IX and\r\nX of the _Origin_. But part of the contents of Chapter X (_Origin_)\r\noccurs in Chapter VI (1844) on Geographical Distribution. The treatment\r\nof distribution is particularly full and interesting in the 1844 Essay,\r\nbut the arrangement of the material, especially the introduction of §\r\nIII. p. 183, leads to some repetition which is avoided in the _Origin_.\r\nIt should be noted that Hybridism, which has a separate chapter (VIII)\r\nin the _Origin_, is treated in Chapter II of the Essay. Finally that\r\nChapter XIII (_Origin_) corresponds to Chapters VII, VIII and IX of the\r\nwork of 1844.\r\n\r\nThe fact that in 1842, seventeen years before the publication of the\r\n_Origin_, my father should have been able to write out so full an\r\noutline of his future work, is very remarkable. In his Autobiography{25}\r\nhe writes of the 1844 Essay, \"But at that time I overlooked one problem\r\nof great importance.... This problem is the tendency in organic beings\r\ndescended from the same stock to diverge in character as they become\r\nmodified.\" The absence of the principle of divergence is of course also\r\na characteristic of the sketch of 1842. But at p. 37, the author is not\r\nfar from this point of view. The passage referred to is: \"If any\r\nspecies, _A_, in changing gets an advantage and that advantage ... is\r\ninherited, _A_ will be the progenitor of several genera or even families\r\nin the hard struggle of nature. _A_ will go on beating out other forms,\r\nit might come that _A_ would people <the> earth,--we may now not have one\r\ndescendant on our globe of the one or several original creations{26}.\"\r\nBut if the descendants of _A_ have peopled the earth by beating out\r\nother forms, they must have diverged in occupying the innumerable\r\ndiverse modes of life from which they expelled their predecessors. What\r\nI wrote{27} on this subject in 1887 is I think true: \"Descent with\r\nmodification implies divergence, and we become so habituated to a belief\r\nin descent, and therefore in divergence, that we do not notice the\r\nabsence of proof that divergence is in itself an advantage.\"\r\n\r\n     {25} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 84.\r\n\r\n     {26} In the footnotes to the Essay of 1844 attention is called to\r\n     similar passages.\r\n\r\n     {27} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 15.\r\n\r\nThe fact that there is no set discussion on the principle of divergence\r\nin the 1844 Essay, makes it clear why the joint paper read before the\r\nLinnean Society on July 1, 1858, included a letter{28} to Asa Gray, as\r\nwell as an extract{29} from the Essay of 1844. It is clearly because the\r\nletter to Gray includes a discussion on divergence, and was thus,\r\nprobably, the only document, including this subject, which could be\r\nappropriately made use of. It shows once more how great was the\r\nimportance attached by its author to the principle of divergence.\r\n\r\n     {28} The passage is given in the _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 124.\r\n\r\n     {29} The extract consists of the section on _Natural Means of\r\n     Selection_, p. 87.\r\n\r\nI have spoken of the hurried and condensed manner in which the sketch of\r\n1842 is written; the style of the later Essay (1844) is more finished.\r\nIt has, however, the air of an uncorrected MS. rather than of a book\r\nwhich has gone through the ordeal of proof sheets. It has not all the\r\nforce and conciseness of the _Origin_, but it has a certain freshness\r\nwhich gives it a character of its own. It must be remembered that the\r\n_Origin_ was an abstract or condensation of a much bigger book, whereas\r\nthe Essay of 1844 was an expansion of the sketch of 1842. It is not\r\ntherefore surprising that in the _Origin_ there is occasionally evident\r\na chafing against the author's self-imposed limitation. Whereas in the\r\n1844 Essay there is an air of freedom, as if the author were letting\r\nhimself go, rather than applying the curb. This quality of freshness and\r\nthe fact that some questions were more fully discussed in 1844 than in\r\n1859, makes the earlier work good reading even to those who are familiar\r\nwith the _Origin_.\r\n\r\nThe writing of this Essay \"during the summer of 1844,\" as stated in the\r\nAutobiography{30}, and \"from memory,\" as Darwin says elsewhere{31}, was\r\na remarkable achievement, and possibly renders more conceivable the\r\nstill greater feat of the writing of the _Origin_ between July 1858 and\r\nSeptember 1859.\r\n\r\n     {30} _Life and Letters_, i. p. 84.\r\n\r\n     {31} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 18.\r\n\r\nIt is an interesting subject for speculation: what influence on the\r\nworld the Essay of 1844 would have exercised, had it been published in\r\nplace of the Origin. The author evidently thought of its publication in\r\nits present state as an undesirable expedient, as appears clearly from\r\nthe following extracts from the _Life and Letters_, vol. ii. pp.\r\n16--18:\r\n\r\n_C. Darwin to Mrs Darwin._\r\n\r\nDOWN, _July 5, 1844_.\r\n\r\n\"... I have just finished my sketch of my species theory. If, as I\r\nbelieve, my theory in time be accepted even by one competent judge, it\r\nwill be a considerable step in science.\r\n\r\n\"I therefore write this in case of my sudden death, as my most solemn\r\nand last request, which I am sure you will consider the same as if\r\nlegally entered in my will, that you will devote £400 to its\r\npublication, and further will yourself, or through Hensleigh{32}, take\r\ntrouble in promoting it. I wish that my sketch be given to some\r\ncompetent person, with this sum to induce him to take trouble in its\r\nimprovement and enlargement. I give to him all my books on Natural\r\nHistory, which are either scored or have references at the end to the\r\npages, begging him carefully to look over and consider such passages as\r\nactually bearing, or by possibility bearing, on this subject. I wish you\r\nto make a list of all such books as some temptation to an editor. I also\r\nrequest that you will hand over <to> him all those scraps roughly divided\r\ninto eight or ten brown paper portfolios. The scraps, with copied\r\nquotations from various works, are those which may aid my editor. I also\r\nrequest that you, or some amanuensis, will aid in deciphering any of the\r\nscraps which the editor may think possibly of use. I leave to the\r\neditor's judgment whether to interpolate these facts in the text, or as\r\nnotes, or under appendices. As the looking over the references and\r\nscraps will be a long labour, and as the _correcting_ and enlarging and\r\naltering my sketch will also take considerable time, I leave this sum of\r\n£400 as some remuneration, and any profits from the work. I consider\r\nthat for this the editor is bound to get the sketch published either at\r\na publisher's or his own risk. Many of the scraps in the portfolios\r\ncontain mere rude suggestions and early views, now useless, and many of\r\nthe facts will probably turn out as having no bearing on my theory.\r\n\r\n     {32} Mrs Darwin's brother.\r\n\r\n\"With respect to editors, Mr Lyell would be the best if he would\r\nundertake it; I believe he would find the work pleasant, and he would\r\nlearn some facts new to him. As the editor must be a geologist as well\r\nas a naturalist, the next best editor would be Professor Forbes of\r\nLondon. The next best (and quite best in many respects) would be\r\nProfessor Henslow. Dr Hooker would be _very_ good. The next, Mr\r\nStrickland{33}. If none of these would undertake it, I would request you\r\nto consult with Mr Lyell, or some other capable man, for some editor, a\r\ngeologist and naturalist. Should one other hundred pounds make the\r\ndifference of procuring a good editor, I request earnestly that you will\r\nraise £500.\r\n\r\n     {33} After Mr Strickland's name comes the following sentence, which\r\n     has been erased, but remains legible. \"Professor Owen would be very\r\n     good; but I presume he would not undertake such a work.\"\r\n\r\n\"My remaining collections in Natural History may be given to any one or\r\nany museum where <they> would be accepted....\"\r\n\r\n<The following note seems to have formed part of the original letter,\r\nbut may have been of later date:>\r\n\r\n\"Lyell, especially with the aid of Hooker (and of any good zoological\r\naid), would be best of all. Without an editor will pledge himself to\r\ngive up time to it, it would be of no use paying such a sum.\r\n\r\n\"If there should be any difficulty in getting an editor who would go\r\nthoroughly into the subject, and think of the bearing of the passages\r\nmarked in the books and copied out of scraps of paper, then let my\r\nsketch be published as it is, stating that it was done several years\r\nago{34}, and from memory without consulting any works, and with no\r\nintention of publication in its present form.\"\r\n\r\n     {34} The words \"several years ago, and\" seem to have been added at\r\n     a later date.\r\n\r\nThe idea that the sketch of 1844 might remain, in the event of his\r\ndeath, as the only record of his work, seems to have been long in his\r\nmind, for in August, 1854, when he had finished with the Cirripedes, and\r\nwas thinking of beginning his \"species work,\" he added on the back of\r\nthe above letter, \"Hooker by far best man to edit my species volume.\r\nAugust 1854.\"\r\n\r\nI have called attention in footnotes to many points in which the\r\n_Origin_ agrees with the _Foundations_. One of the most interesting is\r\nthe final sentence, practically the same in the Essays of 1842 and 1844,\r\nand almost identical with the concluding words of the _Origin_. I have\r\nelsewhere pointed out{35} that the ancestry of this eloquent passage may\r\nbe traced one stage further back,--to the Note Book of 1837. I have\r\ngiven this sentence as an appropriate motto for the _Foundations_ in its\r\ncharacter of a study of general laws. It will be remembered that a\r\ncorresponding motto from Whewell's _Bridgewater Treatise_ is printed\r\nopposite the title-page of the _Origin of Species_.\r\n\r\n     {35} _Life and Letters_, ii. p. 9.\r\n\r\nMr Huxley who, about the year 1887, read the Essay of 1844, remarked\r\nthat \"much more weight is attached to the influence of external\r\nconditions in producing variation and to the inheritance of acquired\r\nhabits than in the _Origin_.\" In the _Foundations_ the effect of\r\nconditions is frequently mentioned, and Darwin seems to have had\r\nconstantly in mind the need of referring each variation to a cause. But\r\nI gain the impression that the slighter prominence given to this view in\r\nthe _Origin_ was not due to change of opinion, but rather because he had\r\ngradually come to take this view for granted; so that in the scheme of\r\nthat book, it was overshadowed by considerations which then seemed to\r\nhim more pressing. With regard to the inheritance of acquired characters\r\nI am not inclined to agree with Huxley. It is certain that the\r\n_Foundations_ contains strong recognition of the importance of germinal\r\nvariation, that is of external conditions acting indirectly through the\r\n\"reproductive functions.\" He evidently considered this as more important\r\nthan the inheritance of habit or other acquired peculiarities.\r\n\r\nAnother point of interest is the weight he attached in 1842-4 to\r\n\"sports\" or what are now called \"mutations.\" This is I think more\r\nprominent in the _Foundations_ than in the first edition of the\r\n_Origin_, and certainly than in the fifth and sixth editions.\r\n\r\nAmong other interesting points may be mentioned the \"good effects of\r\ncrossing\" being \"possibly analogous to good effects of change in\r\ncondition,\"--a principle which he upheld on experimental grounds in his\r\n_Cross and Self-Fertilisation_ in 1876.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion, I desire to express my thanks to Mr Wallace for a\r\nfootnote he was good enough to supply: and to Professor Bateson, Sir W.\r\nThiselton-Dyer, Dr Gadow, Professor Judd, Dr Marr, Col. Prain and Dr\r\nStapf for information on various points. I am also indebted to Mr\r\nRutherford, of the University Library, for his careful copy of the\r\nmanuscript of 1842.\r\n\r\nCAMBRIDGE,\r\n\r\n_June 9, 1909._\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nEXPLANATION OF SIGNS, &c.\r\n\r\n\r\n[] Means that the words so enclosed are erased in the original MS.\r\n\r\n<> Indicates an insertion by the Editor.\r\n\r\n_Origin_, Ed. vi. refers to the Popular Edition.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART I.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ I. <ON VARIATION UNDER DOMESTICATION, AND ON THE PRINCIPLES OF\r\nSELECTION.>\r\n\r\nAn individual organism placed under new conditions [often] sometimes\r\nvaries in a small degree and in very trifling respects such as stature,\r\nfatness, sometimes colour, health, habits in animals and probably\r\ndisposition. Also habits of life develope certain parts. Disuse\r\natrophies. [Most of these slight variations tend to become hereditary.]\r\n\r\nWhen the individual is multiplied for long periods by buds the variation\r\nis yet small, though greater and occasionally a single bud or individual\r\ndeparts widely from its type (example){36} and continues steadily to\r\npropagate, by buds, such new kind.\r\n\r\n     {36} Evidently a memorandum that an example should be given.\r\n\r\nWhen the organism is bred for several generations under new or varying\r\nconditions, the variation is greater in amount and endless in kind\r\n[especially{37} holds good when individuals have long been exposed to\r\nnew conditions]. The nature of the external conditions tends to effect\r\nsome definite change in all or greater part of offspring,--little food,\r\nsmall size--certain foods harmless &c. &c. organs affected and\r\ndiseases--extent unknown. A certain degree of variation (Müller's\r\ntwins){38} seems inevitable effect of process of reproduction. But more\r\nimportant is that simple <?> generation, especially under new conditions\r\n[when no crossing] <causes> infinite variation and not direct effect of\r\nexternal conditions, but only in as much as it affects the reproductive\r\nfunctions{39}. There seems to be no part (_beau ideal_ of liver){40} of\r\nbody, internal or external, or mind or habits, or instincts which does\r\nnot vary in some small degree and [often] some <?> to a great amount.\r\n\r\n     {37} The importance of exposure to new conditions for several\r\n     generations is insisted on in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 7, also p.\r\n     131. In the latter passage the author guards himself against the\r\n     assumption that variations are \"due to chance,\" and speaks of \"our\r\n     ignorance of the cause of each particular variation.\" These\r\n     statements are not always remembered by his critics.\r\n\r\n     {38} Cf. _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 10, vi. p. 9, \"Young of the same\r\n     litter, sometimes differ considerably from each other, though both\r\n     the young and the parents, as Müller has remarked, have apparently\r\n     been exposed to exactly the same conditions of life.\"\r\n\r\n     {39} This is paralleled by the conclusion in the _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     p. 8, that \"the most frequent cause of variability may be\r\n     attributed to the male and female reproductive elements having been\r\n     affected prior to the act of conception.\"\r\n\r\n     {40} The meaning seems to be that there must be some variability in\r\n     the liver otherwise anatomists would not speak of the 'beau ideal'\r\n     of that organ.\r\n\r\n[All such] variations [being congenital] or those very slowly acquired\r\nof all kinds [decidedly evince a tendency to become hereditary], when\r\nnot so become simple variety, when it does a race. Each{41} parent\r\ntransmits its peculiarities, therefore if varieties allowed freely to\r\ncross, except by the _chance_ of two characterized by same peculiarity\r\nhappening to marry, such varieties will be constantly demolished{42}.\r\nAll bisexual animals must cross, hermaphrodite plants do cross, it seems\r\nvery possible that hermaphrodite animals do cross,--conclusion\r\nstrengthened: ill effects of breeding in and in, good effects of\r\ncrossing possibly analogous to good effects of change in condition <?>{43}.\r\n\r\n     {41} The position of the following passage is uncertain. \"If\r\n     individuals of two widely different varieties be allowed to cross,\r\n     a third race will be formed--a most fertile source of the variation\r\n     in domesticated animals. <In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 20 the author\r\n     says that \"the possibility of making distinct races by crossing has\r\n     been greatly exaggerated.\"> If freely allowed, the characters of\r\n     pure parents will be lost, number of races thus <illegible> but\r\n     differences <?> besides the <illegible>. But if varieties differing\r\n     in very slight respects be allowed to cross, such small variation\r\n     will be destroyed, at least to our senses,--a variation [clearly]\r\n     just to be distinguished by long legs will have offspring not to be\r\n     so distinguished. Free crossing great agent in producing uniformity\r\n     in any breed. Introduce tendency to revert to parent form.\"\r\n\r\n     {42} The swamping effect of intercrossing is referred to in the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 103, vi. p. 126.\r\n\r\n     {43} A discussion on the intercrossing of hermaphrodites in\r\n     relation to Knight's views occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 96,\r\n     vi. p. 119. The parallelism between crossing and changed conditions\r\n     is briefly given in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 267, vi. p. 391, and\r\n     was finally investigated in _The Effects of Cross and\r\n     Self-Fertilisation in the Vegetable Kingdom_, 1876.\r\n\r\nTherefore if in any country or district all animals of one species be\r\nallowed freely to cross, any small tendency in them to vary will be\r\nconstantly counteracted. Secondly reversion to parent form--analogue of\r\n_vis medicatrix_{44}. But if man selects, then new races rapidly\r\nformed,--of late years systematically followed,--in most ancient times\r\noften practically followed{45}. By such selection make race-horse,\r\ndray-horse--one cow good for tallow, another for eating &c.--one plant's\r\ngood lay <illegible> in leaves another in fruit &c. &c.: the same plant\r\nto supply his wants at different times of year. By former means animals\r\nbecome adapted, as a direct effect to a cause, to external conditions,\r\nas size of body to amount of food. By this latter means they may also be\r\nso adapted, but further they may be adapted to ends and pursuits, which\r\nby no possibility can affect growth, as existence of tallow-chandler\r\ncannot tend to make fat. In such selected races, if not removed to new\r\nconditions, and <if> preserved from all cross, after several generations\r\nbecome very true, like each other and not varying. But man{46} selects\r\nonly <?> what is useful and curious--has bad judgment, is\r\ncapricious,--grudges to destroy those that do not come up to his\r\npattern,--has no [knowledge] power of selecting according to internal\r\nvariations,--can hardly keep his conditions uniform,--[cannot] does not\r\nselect those best adapted to the conditions under which <the> form <?> lives,\r\nbut those most useful to him. This might all be otherwise.\r\n\r\n     {44} There is an article on the _vis medicatrix_ in Brougham's\r\n     _Dissertations_, 1839, a copy of which is in the author's library.\r\n\r\n     {45} This is the classification of selection into methodical and\r\n     unconscious given in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 33, vi. p. 38.\r\n\r\n     {46} This passage, and a similar discussion on the power of the\r\n     Creator (p. 6), correspond to the comparison between the selective\r\n     capacities of man and nature, in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 83, vi. p.\r\n     102.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ II. <ON VARIATION IN A STATE OF NATURE AND ON THE NATURAL MEANS OF\r\nSELECTION.>\r\n\r\nLet us see how far above principles of variation apply to wild animals.\r\nWild animals vary exceedingly little--yet they are known as\r\nindividuals{47}. British Plants, in many genera number quite uncertain\r\nof varieties and species: in shells chiefly external conditions{48}.\r\nPrimrose and cowslip. Wild animals from different [countries can be\r\nrecognized]. Specific character gives some organs as varying. Variations\r\nanalogous in kind, but less in degree with domesticated animals--chiefly\r\nexternal and less important parts.\r\n\r\n     {47} i.e. they are individually distinguishable.\r\n\r\n     {48} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 133, vi. p. 165.\r\n\r\nOur experience would lead us to expect that any and every one of these\r\norganisms would vary if <the organism were> taken away <?> and placed\r\nunder new conditions. Geology proclaims a constant round of change,\r\nbringing into play, by every possible <?> change of climate and the death\r\nof pre-existing inhabitants, endless variations of new conditions. These\r\n<?> generally very slow, doubtful though <illegible> how far the\r\nslowness <?> would produce tendency to vary. But Geolog<ists> show\r\nchange in configuration which, together with the accidents of air and\r\nwater and the means of transportal which every being possesses, must\r\noccasionally bring, rather suddenly, organism to new conditions and <?>\r\nexpose it for several generations. Hence <?> we should expect every now\r\nand then a wild form to vary{49}; possibly this may be cause of some\r\nspecies varying more than others.\r\n\r\n     {49} When the author wrote this sketch he seems not to have been so\r\n     fully convinced of the general occurrence of variation in nature as\r\n     he afterwards became. The above passage in the text possibly\r\n     suggests that at this time he laid more stress on _sports_ or\r\n     _mutations_ than was afterwards the case.\r\n\r\nAccording to nature of new conditions, so we might expect all or\r\nmajority of organisms born under them to vary in some definite way.\r\nFurther we might expect that the mould in which they are cast would\r\nlikewise vary in some small degree. But is there any means of selecting\r\nthose offspring which vary in the same manner, crossing them and keeping\r\ntheir offspring separate and thus producing selected races: otherwise as\r\nthe wild animals freely cross, so must such small heterogeneous\r\nvarieties be constantly counter-balanced and lost, and a uniformity of\r\ncharacter [kept up] preserved. The former variation as the direct and\r\nnecessary effects of causes, which we can see can act on them, as size\r\nof body from amount of food, effect of certain kinds of food on certain\r\nparts of bodies &c. &c.; such new varieties may then become adapted to\r\nthose external [natural] agencies which act on them. But can varieties\r\nbe produced adapted to end, which cannot possibly influence their\r\nstructure and which it is absurd to look <at> as effects of chance. Can\r\nvarieties like some vars of domesticated animals, like almost all wild\r\nspecies be produced adapted by exquisite means to prey on one animal or\r\nto escape from another,--or rather, as it puts out of question effects\r\nof intelligence and habits, can a plant become adapted to animals, as a\r\nplant which cannot be impregnated without agency of insect; or hooked\r\nseeds depending on animal's existence: woolly animals cannot have any\r\ndirect effect on seeds of plant. This point which all theories about\r\nclimate adapting woodpecker{50} to crawl <?> up trees, <illegible>\r\nmiseltoe, <sentence incomplete>. But if every part of a plant or animal\r\nwas to vary <illegible>, and if a being infinitely more sagacious than\r\nman (not an omniscient creator) during thousands and thousands of years\r\nwere to select all the variations which tended towards certain ends ([or\r\nwere to produce causes <?> which tended to the same end]), for instance,\r\nif he foresaw a canine animal would be better off, owing to the country\r\nproducing more hares, if he were longer legged and keener\r\nsight,--greyhound produced{51}. If he saw that aquatic <animal would\r\nneed> skinned toes. If for some unknown cause he found it would\r\nadvantage a plant, which <?> like most plants is occasionally visited by\r\nbees &c.: if that plant's seed were occasionally eaten by birds and were\r\nthen carried on to rotten trees, he might select trees with fruit more\r\nagreeable to such birds as perched, to ensure their being carried to\r\ntrees; if he perceived those birds more often dropped the seeds, he\r\nmight well have selected a bird who would <illegible> rotten trees or\r\n[gradually select plants which <he> had proved to live on less and less\r\nrotten trees]. Who, seeing how plants vary in garden, what blind foolish\r\nman has done{52} in a few years, will deny an all-seeing being in\r\nthousands of years could effect (if the Creator chose to do so), either\r\nby his own direct foresight or by intermediate means,--which will\r\nrepresent <?> the creator of this universe. Seems usual means. Be it\r\nremembered I have nothing to say about life and mind and _all_ forms\r\ndescending from one common type{53}. I speak of the variation of the\r\nexisting great divisions of the organised kingdom, how far I would go,\r\nhereafter to be seen.\r\n\r\n     {50} The author may possibly have taken the case of the woodpecker\r\n     from Buffon, _Histoire Nat. des Oiseaux_, T. vii. p. 3, 1780, where\r\n     however it is treated from a different point of view. He uses it\r\n     more than once, see for instance _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 3, 60, 184,\r\n     vi. pp. 3, 76, 220. The passage in the text corresponds with a\r\n     discussion on the woodpecker and the mistletoe in _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     p. 3, vi. p. 3.\r\n\r\n     {51} This illustration occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 90, 91,\r\n     vi. pp. 110, 111.\r\n\r\n     {52} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 83, vi. p. 102, where the word\r\n     _Creator_ is replaced by _Nature_.\r\n\r\n     {53} Note in the original. \"Good place to introduce, saying reasons\r\n     hereafter to be given, how far I extend theory, say to all\r\n     mammalia--reasons growing weaker and weaker.\"\r\n\r\nBefore considering whether <there> be any natural means of selection, and\r\nsecondly (which forms the 2nd Part of this sketch) the far more\r\nimportant point whether the characters and relations of animated\r\n<things> are such as favour the idea of wild species being races <?>\r\ndescended from a common stock, as the varieties of potato or dahlia or\r\ncattle having so descended, let us consider probable character of\r\n[selected races] wild varieties.\r\n\r\n_Natural Selection._ De Candolle's war of nature,--seeing contented face\r\nof nature,--may be well at first doubted; we see it on borders of\r\nperpetual cold{54}. But considering the enormous geometrical power of\r\nincrease in every organism and as <?> every country, in ordinary cases\r\n<countries> must be stocked to full extent, reflection will show that\r\nthis is the case. Malthus on man,--in animals no moral [check] restraint\r\n<?>--they breed in time of year when provision most abundant, or season\r\nmost favourable, every country has its seasons,--calculate\r\nrobins,--oscillating from years of destruction{55}. If proof were wanted\r\nlet any singular change of climate <occur> here <?>, how astoundingly\r\nsome tribes <?> increase, also introduced animals{56}, the pressure is\r\nalways ready,--capacity of alpine plants to endure other\r\nclimates,--think of endless seeds scattered abroad,--forests regaining\r\ntheir percentage{57},--a thousand wedges{58} are being forced into the\r\noeconomy of nature. This requires much reflection; study Malthus and\r\ncalculate rates of increase and remember the resistance,--only\r\nperiodical.\r\n\r\n     {54} See _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 62, 63, vi. p. 77, where similar\r\n     reference is made to De Candolle; for Malthus see _Origin_, p. 5.\r\n\r\n     {55} This may possibly refer to the amount of destruction going on.\r\n     See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 68, vi. p. 84, where there is an estimate\r\n     of a later date as to death-rate of birds in winter. \"Calculate\r\n     robins\" probably refers to a calculation of the rate of increase of\r\n     birds under favourable conditions.\r\n\r\n     {56} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 64, 65, vi. p. 80, he instances\r\n     cattle and horses and certain plants in S. America and American\r\n     species of plants in India, and further on, as unexpected effects\r\n     of changed conditions, the enclosure of a heath, and the relation\r\n     between the fertilisation of clover and the presence of cats\r\n     (_Origin_, Ed. i. p. 74, vi. p. 91).\r\n\r\n     {57} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 74, vi. p. 91. \"It has been observed that\r\n     the trees now growing on ... ancient Indian mounds ... display the\r\n     same beautiful diversity and proportion of kinds as in the\r\n     surrounding virgin forests.\"\r\n\r\n     {58} The simile of the wedge occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 67;\r\n     it is deleted in Darwin's copy of the first edition: it does not\r\n     occur in Ed. vi.\r\n\r\nThe unavoidable effect of this <is> that many of every species are\r\ndestroyed either in egg or [young or mature (the former state the more\r\ncommon)]. In the course of a thousand generations infinitesimally small\r\ndifferences must inevitably tell{59}; when unusually cold winter, or hot\r\nor dry summer comes, then out of the whole body of individuals of any\r\nspecies, if there be the smallest differences in their structure,\r\nhabits, instincts [senses], health &c, <it> will on an average tell; as\r\nconditions change a rather larger proportion will be preserved: so if\r\nthe chief check to increase falls on seeds or eggs, so will, in the\r\ncourse of 1000 generations or ten thousand, those seeds (like one with\r\ndown to fly{60}) which fly furthest and get scattered most ultimately\r\nrear most plants, and such small differences tend to be hereditary like\r\nshades of expression in human countenance. So if one parent <?> fish\r\ndeposits its egg in infinitesimally different circumstances, as in\r\nrather shallower or deeper water &c., it will then <?> tell.\r\n\r\n     {59} In a rough summary at the close of the Essay, occur the\r\n     words:--\"Every creature lives by a struggle, smallest grain in\r\n     balance must tell.\"\r\n\r\n     {60} Cf. _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 77, vi. p. 94.\r\n\r\nLet hares{61} increase very slowly from change of climate affecting\r\npeculiar plants, and some other <illegible> rabbit decrease in same\r\nproportion [let this unsettle organisation of], a canine animal, who\r\nformerly derived its chief sustenance by springing on rabbits or\r\nrunning them by scent, must decrease too and might thus readily become\r\nexterminated. But if its form varied very slightly, the long legged\r\nfleet ones, during a thousand years being selected, and the less fleet\r\nrigidly destroyed must, if no law of nature be opposed to it, alter\r\nforms.\r\n\r\n     {61} This is a repetition of what is given at p. 6.\r\n\r\nRemember how soon Bakewell on the same principle altered cattle and\r\nWestern, sheep,--carefully avoiding a cross (pigeons) with any breed.\r\nWe cannot suppose that one plant tends to vary in fruit and another\r\nin flower, and another in flower and foliage,--some have been selected\r\nfor both fruit and flower: that one animal varies in its covering and\r\nanother not,--another in its milk. Take any organism and ask what is\r\nit useful for and on that point it will be found to vary,--cabbages\r\nin their leaf,--corn in size <and> quality of grain, both in times\r\nof year,--kidney beans for young pod and cotton for envelope of seeds\r\n&c. &c.: dogs in intellect, courage, fleetness and smell <?>: pigeons\r\nin peculiarities approaching to monsters. This requires\r\nconsideration,--should be introduced in first chapter if it holds, I\r\nbelieve it does. It is hypothetical at best{62}.\r\n\r\n     {62} Compare _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 41, vi. p. 47. \"I have seen it\r\n     gravely remarked, that it was most fortunate that the strawberry\r\n     began to vary just when gardeners began to attend closely to this\r\n     plant. No doubt the strawberry had always varied since it was\r\n     cultivated, but the slight varieties had been neglected.\"\r\n\r\nNature's variation far less, but such selection far more rigid and\r\nscrutinising. Man's races not [even so well] only not better adapted to\r\nconditions than other races, but often not <?> one race adapted to its\r\nconditions, as man keeps and propagates some alpine plants in garden.\r\nNature lets <an> animal live, till on actual proof it is found less able\r\nto do the required work to serve the desired end, man judges solely by\r\nhis eye, and knows not whether nerves, muscles, arteries, are developed\r\nin proportion to the change of external form.\r\n\r\nBesides selection by death, in bisexual animals <illegible> the\r\nselection in time of fullest vigour, namely struggle of males; even in\r\nanimals which pair there seems a surplus <?> and a battle, possibly as in\r\nman more males produced than females, struggle of war or charms{63}.\r\nHence that male which at that time is in fullest vigour, or best armed\r\nwith arms or ornaments of its species, will gain in hundreds of\r\ngenerations some small advantage and transmit such characters to its\r\noffspring. So in female rearing its young, the most vigorous and skilful\r\nand industrious, <whose> instincts <are> best developed, will rear more\r\nyoung, probably possessing her good qualities, and a greater number will\r\nthus <be> prepared for the struggle of nature. Compared to man using a\r\nmale alone of good breed. This latter section only of limited\r\napplication, applies to variation of [specific] sexual characters.\r\nIntroduce here contrast with Lamarck,--absurdity of habit, or chance??\r\nor external conditions, making a woodpecker adapted to tree{64}.\r\n\r\n     {63} Here we have the two types of sexual selection discussed in\r\n     the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 88 et seq., vi. pp. 108 et seq.\r\n\r\n     {64} It is not obvious why the author objects to \"chance\" or\r\n     \"external conditions making a woodpecker.\" He allows that variation\r\n     is ultimately referable to conditions and that the nature of the\r\n     connexion is unknown, i.e. that the result is fortuitous. It is not\r\n     clear in the original to how much of the passage the two ? refer.\r\n\r\nBefore considering difficulties of theory of selection let us consider\r\ncharacter of the races produced, as now explained, by nature. Conditions\r\nhave varied slowly and the organisms best adapted in their whole course\r\nof life to the changed conditions have always been selected,--man\r\nselects small dog and afterwards gives it profusion of food,--selects a\r\nlong-backed and short-legged breed and gives it no particular exercise\r\nto suit this function &c. &c. In ordinary cases nature has not allowed\r\nher race to be contaminated with a cross of another race, and\r\nagriculturists know how difficult they find always to prevent\r\nthis,--effect would be trueness. This character and sterility when\r\ncrossed, and generally a greater amount of difference, are two main\r\nfeatures, which distinguish domestic races from species.\r\n\r\n[Sterility not universal admitted by all{65}. _Gladiolus_, _Crinum_,\r\n_Calceolaria_{66} must be species if there be such a thing. Races of\r\ndogs and oxen: but certainly very general; indeed a gradation of\r\nsterility most perfect{67} very general. Some nearest species will not\r\ncross (crocus, some heath <?>), some genera cross readily (fowls{68} and\r\ngrouse, peacock &c.). Hybrids no ways monstrous quite perfect except\r\nsecretions{69} hence even the mule has bred,--character of sterility,\r\nespecially a few years ago <?> thought very much more universal than it now\r\nis, has been thought the distinguishing character; indeed it is obvious\r\nif all forms freely crossed, nature would be a chaos. But the very\r\ngradation of the character, even if it always existed in some degree\r\nwhich it does not, renders it impossible as marks <?> those <?> suppose\r\ndistinct as species{70}]. Will analogy throw any light on the fact of\r\nthe supposed races of nature being sterile, though none of the domestic\r\nones are? Mr Herbert <and> Koelreuter have shown external differences will\r\nnot guide one in knowing whether hybrids will be fertile or not, but the\r\nchief circumstance is constitutional differences{71}, such as being\r\nadapted to different climate or soil, differences which [must] probably\r\naffect the whole body of the organism and not any one part. Now wild\r\nanimals, taken out of their natural conditions, seldom breed. I do not\r\nrefer to shows or to Zoological Societies where many animals unite, but\r\n<do not?> breed, and others will never unite, but to wild animals caught\r\nand kept _quite tame_ left loose and well fed about houses and living\r\nmany years. Hybrids produced almost as readily as pure breds. St Hilaire\r\ngreat distinction of tame and domestic,--elephants,--ferrets{72}.\r\nReproductive organs not subject to disease in Zoological Garden.\r\nDissection and microscope show that hybrid is in exactly same condition\r\nas another animal in the intervals of breeding season, or those animals\r\nwhich taken wild and _not bred_ in domesticity, remain without breeding\r\ntheir whole lives. It should be observed that so far from domesticity\r\nbeing unfavourable in itself <it> makes more fertile: [when animal is\r\ndomesticated and breeds, productive power increased from more food and\r\nselection of fertile races]. As far as animals go might be thought <an>\r\neffect on their mind and a special case.\r\n\r\n     {65} The meaning is \"That sterility is not universal is admitted by\r\n     all.\"\r\n\r\n     {66} See _Var. under Dom._, Ed. 2, i. p. 388, where the garden\r\n     forms of _Gladiolus_ and _Calceolaria_ are said to be derived from\r\n     crosses between distinct species. Herbert's hybrid _Crinums_ are\r\n     discussed in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 250, vi. p. 370. It is well\r\n     known that the author believed in a multiple origin of domestic\r\n     dogs.\r\n\r\n     {67} The argument from gradation in sterility is given in the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 248, 255, vi. pp. 368, 375. In the _Origin_, I\r\n     have not come across the cases mentioned, viz. crocus, heath, or\r\n     grouse and fowl or peacock. For sterility between closely allied\r\n     species, see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 257, vi. p. 377. In the present\r\n     essay the author does not distinguish between fertility between\r\n     species and the fertility of the hybrid offspring, a point on which\r\n     he insists in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 245, vi. p. 365.\r\n\r\n     {68} Ackermann (_Ber. d. Vereins f. Naturkunde zu Kassel_, 1898, p.\r\n     23) quotes from Gloger that a cross has been effected between a\r\n     domestic hen and a _Tetrao tetrix_; the offspring died when three\r\n     days old.\r\n\r\n     {69} No doubt the sexual cells are meant. I do not know on what\r\n     evidence it is stated that the mule has bred.\r\n\r\n     {70} The sentence is all but illegible. I think that the author\r\n     refers to forms usually ranked as varieties having been marked as\r\n     species when it was found that they were sterile together. See the\r\n     case of the red and blue _Anagallis_ given from Gärtner in the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 247, vi. p. 368.\r\n\r\n     {71} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 258, where the author speaks of\r\n     constitutional differences in this connexion, he specifies that\r\n     they are confined to the reproductive system.\r\n\r\n     {72} The sensitiveness of the reproductive system to changed\r\n     conditions is insisted on in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 8, vi. p. 10.\r\n\r\n     The ferret is mentioned, as being prolific in captivity, in _Var.\r\n     under Dom._, Ed. 2, ii. p. 90.\r\n\r\nBut turning to plants we find same class of facts. I do not refer to\r\nseeds not ripening, perhaps the commonest cause, but to plants not\r\nsetting, which either is owing to some imperfection of ovule or pollen.\r\nLindley says sterility is the [curse] bane of all propagators,--Linnæus\r\nabout alpine plants. American bog plants,--pollen in exactly same state\r\nas in hybrids,--same in geraniums. Persian and Chinese{73} lilac will\r\nnot seed in Italy and England. Probably double plants and all fruits owe\r\ntheir developed parts primarily <?> to sterility and extra food thus <?>\r\napplied{74}. There is here gradation <in> sterility and then parts, like\r\ndiseases, are transmitted hereditarily. We cannot assign any cause why\r\nthe Pontic Azalea produces plenty of pollen and not American{75}, why\r\ncommon lilac seeds and not Persian, we see no difference in healthiness.\r\nWe know not on what circumstances these facts depend, why ferret breeds,\r\nand cheetah{76}, elephant and pig in India will not.\r\n\r\n     {73} Lindley's remark is quoted in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 9.\r\n     Linnæus' remark is to the effect that Alpine plants tend to be\r\n     sterile under cultivation (see _Var. under Dom._, Ed. 2, ii. p.\r\n     147). In the same place the author speaks of peat-loving plants\r\n     being sterile in our gardens,--no doubt the American bog-plants\r\n     referred to above. On the following page (p. 148) the sterility of\r\n     the lilac (_Syringa persica_ and _chinensis_) is referred to.\r\n\r\n     {74} The author probably means that the increase in the petals is\r\n     due to a greater food supply being available for them owing to\r\n     sterility. See the discussion in _Var. under Dom._, Ed. 2, ii. p.\r\n     151. It must be noted that doubleness of the flower may exist\r\n     without noticeable sterility.\r\n\r\n     {75} I have not come across this case in the author's works.\r\n\r\n     {76} For the somewhat doubtful case of the cheetah (_Felis jubata_)\r\n     see _Var. under Dom._, Ed. 2, ii. p. 133. I do not know to what\r\n     fact \"pig in India\" refers.\r\n\r\nNow in crossing it is certain every peculiarity in form and constitution\r\nis transmitted: an alpine plant transmits its alpine tendency to its\r\noffspring, an American plant its American-bog constitution, and <with>\r\nanimals, those peculiarities, on which{77} when placed out of their\r\nnatural conditions they are incapable of breeding; and moreover they\r\ntransmit every part of their constitution, their respiration, their\r\npulse, their instinct, which are all suddenly modified, can it be\r\nwondered at that they are incapable of breeding? I think it may be truly\r\nsaid it would be more wonderful if they did. But it may be asked why\r\nhave not the recognised varieties, supposed to have been produced\r\nthrough the means of man, [not refused to breed] have all bred{78}.\r\nVariation depends on change of condition and selection{79}, as far as\r\nman's systematic or unsystematic selection <has> gone; he takes external\r\nform, has little power from ignorance over internal invisible\r\nconstitutional differences. Races which have long been domesticated, and\r\nhave much varied, are precisely those which were capable of bearing\r\ngreat changes, whose constitutions were adapted to a diversity of\r\nclimates. Nature changes slowly and by degrees. According to many\r\nauthors probably breeds of dogs are another case of modified species\r\nfreely crossing. There is no variety which <illegible> has been <illegible>\r\nadapted to peculiar soil or situation for a thousand years and another\r\nrigorously adapted to another, till such can be produced, the question\r\nis not tried{80}. Man in past ages, could transport into different\r\nclimates, animals and plants which would freely propagate in such new\r\nclimates. Nature could effect, with selection, such changes slowly, so\r\nthat precisely those animals which are adapted to submit to great\r\nchanges have given rise to diverse races,--and indeed great doubt on\r\nthis head{81}.\r\n\r\n     {77} This sentence should run \"on which depends their incapacity to\r\n     breed in unnatural conditions.\"\r\n\r\n     {78} This sentence ends in confusion: it should clearly close with\r\n     the words \"refused to breed\" in place of the bracket and the\r\n     present concluding phrase.\r\n\r\n     {79} The author doubtless refers to the change produced by the\r\n     _summation_ of variation by means of selection.\r\n\r\n     {80} The meaning of this sentence is made clear by a passage in the\r\n     MS. of 1844:--\"Until man selects two varieties from the same stock,\r\n     adapted to two climates or to other different external conditions,\r\n     and confines each rigidly for one or several thousand years to such\r\n     conditions, always selecting the individuals best adapted to them,\r\n     he cannot be said to have even commenced the experiment.\" That is,\r\n     the attempt to produce mutually sterile domestic breeds.\r\n\r\n     {81} This passage is to some extent a repetition of a previous one\r\n     and may have been intended to replace an earlier sentence. I have\r\n     thought it best to give both. In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 141, vi.\r\n     p. 176, the author gives his opinion that the power of resisting\r\n     diverse conditions, seen in man and his domestic animals, is an\r\n     example \"of a very common flexibility of constitution.\"\r\n\r\nBefore leaving this subject well to observe that it was shown that a\r\ncertain amount of variation is consequent on mere act of reproduction,\r\nboth by buds and sexually,--is vastly increased when parents exposed for\r\nsome generations to new conditions{82}, and we now find that many\r\nanimals when exposed for first time to very new conditions, are <as>\r\nincapable of breeding as hybrids. It [probably] bears also on supposed\r\nfact of crossed animals when not infertile, as in mongrels, tending to\r\nvary much, as likewise seems to be the case, when true hybrids possess\r\njust sufficient fertility to propagate with the parent breeds and _inter\r\nse_ for some generations. This is Koelreuter's belief. These facts throw\r\nlight on each other and support the truth of each other, we see\r\nthroughout a connection between the reproductive faculties and exposure\r\nto changed conditions of life whether by crossing or exposure of the\r\nindividuals{83}.\r\n\r\n     {82} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. Chs. I. and V., the author does not\r\n     admit reproduction, apart from environment, as being a cause of\r\n     variation. With regard to the cumulative effect of new conditions\r\n     there are many passages in the _Origin_, Ed. i. e.g. pp. 7, 12, vi.\r\n     pp. 8, 14.\r\n\r\n     {83} As already pointed out, this is the important principle\r\n     investigated in the author's _Cross and Self-Fertilisation_.\r\n     Professor Bateson has suggested to me that the experiments should\r\n     be repeated with gametically pure individuals.\r\n\r\n_Difficulties on theory of selection_{84}. It may be objected such\r\nperfect organs as eye and ear, could never be formed, in latter less\r\ndifficulty as gradations more perfect; at first appears monstrous and to\r\n<the> end appears difficulty. But think of gradation, even now manifest,\r\n(Tibia and Fibula). Everyone will allow if every fossil preserved,\r\ngradation infinitely more perfect; for possibility of selection a\r\nperfect <?> gradation is required. Different groups of structure, slight\r\ngradation in each group,--every analogy renders it probable that\r\nintermediate forms have existed. Be it remembered what strange\r\nmetamorphoses; part of eye, not directly connected with vision, might\r\ncome to be [thus used] gradually worked in for this end,--swimming\r\nbladder by gradation of structure is admitted to belong to the ear\r\nsystem,--rattlesnake. [Woodpecker best adapted to climb.] In some cases\r\ngradation not possible,--as vertebræ,--actually vary in domestic\r\nanimals,--less difficult if growth followed. Looking to whole animals, a\r\nbat formed not for flight{85}. Suppose we had flying fish{86} and not\r\none of our now called flying fish preserved, who would have guessed\r\nintermediate habits. Woodpeckers and tree-frogs both live in countries\r\nwhere no trees{87}.\r\n\r\n     {84} In the _Origin_ a chapter is given up to \"difficulties on\r\n     theory\": the discussion in the present essay seems slight even when\r\n     it is remembered how small a space is here available. For _Tibia_\r\n     &c. see p. 48.\r\n\r\n     {85} This may be interpreted \"The general structure of a bat is the\r\n     same as that of non-flying mammals.\"\r\n\r\n     {86} That is truly winged fish.\r\n\r\n     {87} The terrestrial woodpecker of S. America formed the subject of\r\n     a paper by Darwin, _Proc. Zool. Soc._, 1870. See _Life and\r\n     Letters_, vol. iii. p. 153.\r\n\r\nThe gradations by which each individual organ has arrived at its present\r\nstate, and each individual animal with its aggregate of organs has\r\narrived, probably never could be known, and all present great\r\ndifficulties. I merely wish to show that the proposition is not so\r\nmonstrous as it at first appears, and that if good reason can be\r\nadvanced for believing the species have descended from common parents,\r\nthe difficulty of imagining intermediate forms of structure not\r\nsufficient to make one at once reject the theory.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ III. <ON VARIATION IN INSTINCTS AND OTHER MENTAL ATTRIBUTES.>\r\n\r\nThe mental powers of different animals in wild and tame state [present\r\nstill greater difficulties] require a separate section. Be it remembered\r\nI have nothing to do with origin of memory, attention, and the different\r\nfaculties of the mind{88}, but merely with their differences in each of\r\nthe great divisions of nature. Disposition, courage, pertinacity <?>,\r\nsuspicion, restlessness, ill-temper, sagacity and <the> reverse\r\nunquestionably vary in animals and are inherited (Cuba wildness dogs,\r\nrabbits, fear against particular object as man Galapagos{89}). Habits\r\npurely corporeal, breeding season &c., time of going to rest &c., vary\r\nand are hereditary, like the analogous habits of plants which vary and\r\nare inherited. Habits of body, as manner of movement d^o. and d^o.\r\nHabits, as pointing and setting on certain occasions d^o. Taste for\r\nhunting certain objects and manner of doing so,--sheep-dog. These are\r\nshown clearly by crossing and their analogy with true instinct thus\r\nshown,--retriever. Do not know objects for which they do it. Lord\r\nBrougham's definition{90}. Origin partly habit, but the amount\r\nnecessarily unknown, partly selection. Young pointers pointing stones\r\nand sheep--tumbling pigeons--sheep{91} going back to place where born.\r\nInstinct aided by reason, as in the taylor-bird{92}. Taught by parents,\r\ncows choosing food, birds singing. Instincts vary in wild state (birds\r\nget wilder) often lost{93}; more perfect,--nest without roof. These\r\nfacts [only clear way] show how incomprehensibly brain has power of\r\ntransmitting intellectual operations.\r\n\r\n     {88} The same proviso occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 207, vi. p.\r\n     319.\r\n\r\n     {89} The tameness of the birds in the Galapagos is described in the\r\n     _Journal of Researches_ (1860), p. 398. Dogs and rabbits are\r\n     probably mentioned as cases in which the hereditary fear of man has\r\n     been lost. In the 1844 MS. the author states that the Cuban feral\r\n     dog shows great natural wildness, even when caught quite young.\r\n\r\n     {90} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 207, vi. p. 319, he refuses to\r\n     define instinct. For Lord Brougham's definition see his\r\n     _Dissertations on Subjects of Science etc._, 1839, p. 27.\r\n\r\n     {91} See James Hogg (the Ettrick Shepherd), Works, 1865, _Tales and\r\n     Sketches_, p. 403.\r\n\r\n     {92} This refers to the tailor-bird making use of manufactured\r\n     thread supplied to it, instead of thread twisted by itself.\r\n\r\n     {93} _Often lost_ applies to _instinct_: _birds get wilder_ is\r\n     printed in a parenthesis because it was apparently added as an\r\n     after-thought. _Nest without roof_ refers to the water-ousel\r\n     omitting to vault its nest when building in a protected situation.\r\n\r\nFaculties{94} distinct from true instincts,--finding [way]. It must I\r\nthink be admitted that habits whether congenital or acquired by practice\r\n[sometimes] often become inherited{95}; instincts, influence, equally\r\nwith structure, the preservation of animals; therefore selection must,\r\nwith changing conditions tend to modify the inherited habits of animals.\r\nIf this be admitted it will be found _possible_ that many of the\r\nstrangest instincts may be thus acquired. I may observe, without\r\nattempting definition, that an inherited habit or trick (trick because\r\nmay be born) fulfils closely what we mean by instinct. A habit is often\r\nperformed unconsciously, the strangest habits become associated, d^o.\r\ntricks, going in certain spots &c. &c., even against will, is excited by\r\nexternal agencies, and looks not to the end,--a person playing a\r\npianoforte. If such a habit were transmitted it would make a marvellous\r\ninstinct. Let us consider some of the most difficult cases of instincts,\r\nwhether they could be _possibly_ acquired. I do not say _probably_, for\r\nthat belongs to our 3rd Part{96}, I beg this may be remembered, nor do I\r\nmean to attempt to show exact method. I want only to show that whole\r\ntheory ought not at once to be rejected on this score.\r\n\r\n     {94} In the MS. of 1844 is an interesting discussion on _faculty_\r\n     as distinct from _instinct_.\r\n\r\n     {95} At this date and for long afterwards the inheritance of\r\n     acquired characters was assumed to occur.\r\n\r\n     {96} Part II. is here intended: see the Introduction.\r\n\r\nEvery instinct must, by my theory, have been acquired gradually by\r\nslight changes <illegible> of former instinct, each change being useful\r\nto its then species. Shamming death struck me at first as remarkable\r\nobjection. I found none really sham death{97}, and that there is\r\ngradation; now no one doubts that those insects which do it either more\r\nor less, do it for some good, if then any species was led to do it more,\r\nand then <?> escaped &c. &c.\r\n\r\n     {97} The meaning is that the attitude assumed in _shamming_ is not\r\n     accurately like that of death.\r\n\r\nTake migratory instincts, faculty distinct from instinct, animals have\r\nnotion of time,--like savages. Ordinary finding way by memory, but how\r\ndoes savage find way across country,--as incomprehensible to us, as\r\nanimal to them,--geological changes,--fishes in river,--case of sheep in\r\nSpain{98}. Architectural instincts,--a manufacturer's employee in making\r\nsingle articles extraordinary skill,--often said seem to make it almost\r\n<illegible>, child born with such a notion of playing{99},--we can\r\nfancy tailoring acquired in same perfection,--mixture of\r\nreason,--water-ouzel,--taylor-bird,--gradation of simple nest to most\r\ncomplicated.\r\n\r\n     {98} This refers to the _transandantes_ sheep mentioned in the MS.\r\n     of 1844, as having acquired a migratory instinct.\r\n\r\n     {99} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 209, vi. p. 321, Mozart's\r\n     pseudo-instinctive skill in piano-playing is mentioned. See _Phil.\r\n     Trans._, 1770, p. 54.\r\n\r\nBees again, distinction of faculty,--how they make a\r\nhexagon,--Waterhouse's theory{100},--the impulse to use whatever faculty\r\nthey possess,--the taylor-bird has the faculty of sewing with beak,\r\ninstinct impels him to do it.\r\n\r\n     {100} In the discussion on bees' cells, _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 225,\r\n     vi. p. 343, the author acknowledges that his theory originated in\r\n     Waterhouse's observations.\r\n\r\nLast case of parent feeding young with different food (take case of\r\nGalapagos birds, gradation from Hawfinch to Sylvia) selection and habit\r\nmight lead old birds to vary taste <?> and form, leaving their instinct of\r\nfeeding their young with same food{101},--or I see no difficulty in\r\nparents being forced or induced to vary the food brought, and selection\r\nadapting the young ones to it, and thus by degree any amount of\r\ndiversity might be arrived at. Although we can never hope to see the\r\ncourse revealed by which different instincts have been acquired, for we\r\nhave only present animals (not well known) to judge of the course of\r\ngradation, yet once grant the principle of habits, whether congenital or\r\nacquired by experience, being inherited and I can see no limit to the\r\n[amount of variation] extraordinariness <?> of the habits thus acquired.\r\n\r\n     {101} The hawfinch-and _Sylvia-_types are figured in the _Journal\r\n     of Researches_, p. 379. The discussion of change of form in\r\n     relation to change of instinct is not clear, and I find it\r\n     impossible to suggest a paraphrase.\r\n\r\n_Summing up this Division._ If variation be admitted to occur\r\noccasionally in some wild animals, and how can we doubt it, when we see\r\n[all] thousands <of> organisms, for whatever use taken by man, do vary.\r\nIf we admit such variations tend to be hereditary, and how can we doubt\r\nit when we <remember> resemblances of features and character,--disease\r\nand monstrosities inherited and endless races produced (1200 cabbages).\r\nIf we admit selection is steadily at work, and who will doubt it, when\r\nhe considers amount of food on an average fixed and reproductive powers\r\nact in geometrical ratio. If we admit that external conditions vary, as\r\nall geology proclaims, they have done and are now doing,--then, if no\r\nlaw of nature be opposed, there must occasionally be formed races,\r\n[slightly] differing from the parent races. So then any such law{102},\r\nnone is known, but in all works it is assumed, in <?> flat contradiction\r\nto all known facts, that the amount of possible variation is soon\r\nacquired. Are not all the most varied species, the oldest domesticated:\r\nwho <would> think that horses or corn could be produced? Take dahlia and\r\npotato, who will pretend in 5000 years{103} <that great changes might\r\nnot be effected>: perfectly adapted to conditions and then again brought\r\ninto varying conditions. Think what has been done in few last years,\r\nlook at pigeons, and cattle. With the amount of food man can produce he\r\nmay have arrived at limit of fatness or size, or thickness of wool <?>,\r\nbut these are the most trivial points, but even in these I conclude it\r\nis impossible to say we know the limit of variation. And therefore with\r\nthe [adapting] selecting power of nature, infinitely wise compared to\r\nthose of man, <I conclude> that it is impossible to say we know the limit\r\nof races, which would be true <to their> kind; if of different\r\nconstitutions would probably be infertile one with another, and which\r\nmight be adapted in the most singular and admirable manner, according to\r\ntheir wants, to external nature and to other surrounding\r\norganisms,--such races would be species. But is there any evidence <that>\r\nspecies <have> been thus produced, this is a question wholly independent\r\nof all previous points, and which on examination of the kingdom of\r\nnature <we> ought to answer one way or another.\r\n\r\n     {102} I should interpret this obscure sentence as follows, \"No such\r\n     opposing law is known, but in all works on the subject a law is (in\r\n     flat contradiction to all known facts) assumed to limit the\r\n     possible amount of variation.\" In the _Origin_, the author never\r\n     limits the power of variation, as far as I know.\r\n\r\n     {103} In _Var. under Dom._ Ed. 2, ii. p. 263, the _Dahlia_ is\r\n     described as showing sensitiveness to conditions in 1841. All the\r\n     varieties of the _Dahlia_ are said to have arisen since 1804\r\n     (_ibid._ i. p. 393).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPART II{104}.\r\n\r\n     {104} In the original MS. the heading is: Part III.; but Part II.\r\n     is clearly intended; for details see the Introduction. I have not\r\n     been able to discover where § IV. ends and § V. begins.\r\n\r\n\r\n§§ IV. & V. <ON THE EVIDENCE FROM GEOLOGY.>\r\n\r\nI may premise, that according to the view ordinarily received, the\r\nmyriads of organisms peopling this world have been created by so many\r\ndistinct acts of creation. As we know nothing of the <illegible> will of a\r\nCreator,--we can see no reason why there should exist any relation\r\nbetween the organisms thus created; or again, they might be created\r\naccording to any scheme. But it would be marvellous if this scheme\r\nshould be the same as would result from the descent of groups of\r\norganisms from [certain] the same parents, according to the\r\ncircumstances, just attempted to be developed.\r\n\r\nWith equal probability did old cosmogonists say fossils were created, as\r\nwe now see them, with a false resemblance to living beings{105}; what\r\nwould the Astronomer say to the doctrine that the planets moved <not>\r\naccording to the law of gravitation, but from the Creator having willed\r\neach separate planet to move in its particular orbit? I believe such a\r\nproposition (if we remove all prejudices) would be as legitimate as to\r\nadmit that certain groups of living and extinct organisms, in their\r\ndistribution, in their structure and in their relations one to another\r\nand to external conditions, agreed with the theory and showed signs of\r\ncommon descent, and yet were created distinct. As long as it was thought\r\nimpossible that organisms should vary, or should anyhow become adapted\r\nto other organisms in a complicated manner, and yet be separated from\r\nthem by an impassable barrier of sterility{106}, it was justifiable,\r\neven with some appearance in favour of a common descent, to admit\r\ndistinct creation according to the will of an Omniscient Creator; or,\r\nfor it is the same thing, to say with Whewell that the beginnings of all\r\nthings surpass the comprehension of man. In the former sections I have\r\nendeavoured to show that such variation or specification is not\r\nimpossible, nay, in many points of view is absolutely probable. What\r\nthen is the evidence in favour of it and what the evidence against it.\r\nWith our imperfect knowledge of past ages [surely there will be some] it\r\nwould be strange if the imperfection did not create some unfavourable\r\nevidence.\r\n\r\n     {105} This passage corresponds roughly to the conclusion of the\r\n     _Origin_, see Ed. i. p. 482, vi. p. 661.\r\n\r\n     {106} A similar passage occurs in the conclusion of the _Origin_,\r\n     Ed. i. p. 481, vi. p. 659.\r\n\r\nGive sketch of the Past,--beginning with facts appearing hostile under\r\npresent knowledge,--then proceed to geograph. distribution,--order of\r\nappearance,--affinities,--morphology &c., &c.\r\n\r\nOur theory requires a very gradual introduction of new forms{107}, and\r\nextermination of the old (to which we shall revert). The extermination\r\nof old may sometimes be rapid, but never the introduction. In the groups\r\ndescended from common parent, our theory requires a perfect gradation\r\nnot differing more than breed<s> of cattle, or potatoes, or cabbages in\r\nforms. I do not mean that a graduated series of animals must have\r\nexisted, intermediate between horse, mouse, tapir{108}, elephant [or\r\nfowl and peacock], but that these must have had a common parent, and\r\nbetween horse and this <?> parent &c., &c., but the common parent may\r\npossibly have differed more from either than the two do now from each\r\nother. Now what evidence of this is there? So perfect gradation in some\r\ndepartments, that some naturalists have thought that in some large\r\ndivisions, if all existing forms were collected, a near approach to\r\nperfect gradation would be made. But such a notion is preposterous with\r\nrespect to all, but evidently so with mammals. Other naturalists have\r\nthought this would be so if all the specimens entombed in the strata\r\nwere collected{109}. I conceive there is no probability whatever of\r\nthis; nevertheless it is certain all the numerous fossil forms fall\r\nin<to>, as Buckland remarks, _not_ present classes, families and genera,\r\nthey fall between them: so is it with new discoveries of existing forms.\r\nMost ancient fossils, that is most separated <by> space of time, are most\r\napt to fall between the classes--(but organisms from those countries\r\nmost separated by space also fall between the classes <_e.g._>\r\nOrnithorhyncus?). As far as geological discoveries <go> they tend towards\r\nsuch gradation{110}. Illustrate it with net. Toxodon,--tibia and\r\nfibula,--dog and otter,--but so utterly improbable is <it>, in _ex. gr._\r\nPachydermata, to compose series as perfect as cattle, that if, as many\r\ngeologists seem to infer, each separate formation presents even an\r\napproach to a consecutive history, my theory must be given up. Even if\r\nit were consecutive, it would only collect series of one district in our\r\npresent state of knowledge; but what probability is there that any one\r\nformation during the _immense_ period which has elapsed during each\r\nperiod will _generally_ present a consecutive history. [Compare number\r\nliving at one period to fossils preserved--look at enormous periods of\r\ntime.]\r\n\r\n     {107} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 312, vi. p. 453.\r\n\r\n     {108} See _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 280, 281, vi. p. 414. The author\r\n     uses his experience of pigeons for examples for what he means by\r\n     _intermediate_; the instance of the horse and tapir also occurs.\r\n\r\n     {109} The absence of intermediate forms between living organisms\r\n     (and also as regards fossils) is discussed in the _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     pp. 279, 280, vi. p. 413. In the above discussion there is no\r\n     evidence that the author felt this difficulty so strongly as it is\r\n     expressed in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 299,--as perhaps \"the most\r\n     obvious and gravest objection that can be urged against my theory.\"\r\n     But in a rough summary written on the back of the penultimate page\r\n     of the MS. he refers to the geological evidence:--\"Evidence, as far\r\n     as it does go, is favourable, exceedingly incomplete,--greatest\r\n     difficulty on this theory. I am convinced not insuperable.\"\r\n     Buckland's remarks are given in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 329, vi. p.\r\n     471.\r\n\r\n     {110} That the evidence of geology, as far as it goes, is\r\n     favourable to the theory of descent is claimed in the _Origin_, Ed.\r\n     i. pp. 343-345, vi. pp. 490-492. For the reference to _net_ in the\r\n     following sentence, see Note 1, p. 48, {Note 161} of this Essay.\r\n\r\nReferring only to marine animals, which are obviously most likely to be\r\npreserved, they must live where <?> sediment (of a kind favourable for\r\npreservation, not sand and pebble){111} is depositing quickly and over\r\nlarge area and must be thickly capped, <illegible> littoral deposits:\r\nfor otherwise denudation <will destroy them>,--they must live in a\r\nshallow space which sediment will tend to fill up,--as movement is <in?>\r\nprogress if soon brought <?> up <?> subject to denudation,--[if] as\r\nduring subsidence favourable, accords with facts of European\r\ndeposits{112}, but subsidence apt to destroy agents which produce\r\nsediment{113}.\r\n\r\n     {111} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 288, vi. p. 422. \"The remains that do\r\n     become embedded, if in sand and gravel, will, when the beds are\r\n     upraised, generally be dissolved by the percolation of rain-water.\"\r\n\r\n     {112} The position of the following is not clear:--\"Think of\r\n     immense differences in nature of European deposits,--without\r\n     interposing new causes,--think of time required by present slow\r\n     changes, to cause, on very same area, such diverse deposits,\r\n     iron-sand, chalk, sand, coral, clay!\"\r\n\r\n     {113} The paragraph which ends here is difficult to interpret. In\r\n     spite of obscurity it is easy to recognize the general resemblance\r\n     to the discussion on the importance of subsidence given in the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 290 et seq., vi. pp. 422 et seq.\r\n\r\nI believe safely inferred <that> groups of marine <?> fossils only\r\npreserved for future ages where sediment goes on long <and>\r\ncontinuous<ly> and with rapid but not too rapid deposition in <an> area\r\nof subsidence. In how few places in any one region like Europe will <?>\r\nthese contingencies be going on? Hence <?> in past ages mere [gaps]\r\npages preserved{114}. Lyell's doctrine carried to extreme,--we shall\r\nunderstand difficulty if it be asked:--what chance of series of\r\ngradation between cattle by <illegible> at age <illegible> as far back\r\nas Miocene{115}? We know then cattle existed. Compare number of\r\nliving,--immense duration of each period,--fewness of fossils.\r\n\r\n     {114} See Note 3, p. 27.\r\n\r\n     {115} Compare _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 298, vi. p. 437. \"We shall,\r\n     perhaps, best perceive the improbability of our being enabled to\r\n     connect species by numerous, fine, intermediate, fossil links, by\r\n     asking ourselves whether, for instance, geologists at some future\r\n     period will be able to prove that our different breeds of cattle,\r\n     sheep, horses, and dogs have descended from a single stock or from\r\n     several aboriginal stocks.\"\r\n\r\nThis only refers to consecutiveness of history of organisms of each\r\nformation.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing argument will show firstly, that formations are distinct\r\nmerely from want of fossils <of intermediate beds>, and secondly, that\r\neach formation is full of gaps, has been advanced to account for\r\n_fewness_ of _preserved_ organisms compared to what have lived on the\r\nworld. The very same argument explains why in older formations the\r\norganisms appear to come on and disappear suddenly,--but in [later]\r\ntertiary not quite suddenly{116}, in later tertiary gradually,--becoming\r\nrare and disappearing,--some have disappeared within man's time. It is\r\nobvious that our theory requires gradual and nearly uniform\r\nintroduction, possibly more sudden extermination,--subsidence of\r\ncontinent of Australia &c., &c.\r\n\r\n     {116} The sudden appearance of groups of allied species in the\r\n     lowest known fossiliferous strata is discussed in the _Origin_, Ed.\r\n     i. p. 306, vi. p. 446. The gradual appearance in the later strata\r\n     occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 312, vi. p. 453.\r\n\r\nOur theory requires that the first form which existed of each of the\r\ngreat divisions would present points intermediate between existing ones,\r\nbut immensely different. Most geologists believe Silurian{117} fossils\r\nare those which first existed in the whole world, not those which have\r\nchanced to be the oldest not destroyed,--or the first which existed in\r\nprofoundly deep seas in progress of conversion from sea to land: if they\r\nare first they <? we> give up. Not so Hutton or Lyell: if first\r\nreptile{118} of Red Sandstone <?> really was first which existed: if\r\nPachyderm{119} of Paris was first which existed: fish of Devonian:\r\ndragon fly of Lias: for we cannot suppose them the progenitors: they\r\nagree too closely with existing divisions. But geologists consider\r\nEurope as <?> a passage from sea to island <?> to continent (except\r\nWealden, see Lyell). These animals therefore, I consider then mere\r\nintroduction <?> from continents long since submerged.\r\n\r\n     {117} Compare _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 307, vi. p. 448.\r\n\r\n     {118} I have interpreted as _Sandstone_ a scrawl which I first read\r\n     as _Sea_; I have done so at the suggestion of Professor Judd, who\r\n     points out that \"footprints in the red sandstone were known at that\r\n     time, and geologists were not then particular to distinguish\r\n     between Amphibians and Reptiles.\"\r\n\r\n     {119} This refers to Cuvier's discovery of _Palæotherium_ &c. at\r\n     Montmartre.\r\n\r\nFinally, if views of some geologists be correct, my theory must be given\r\nup. [Lyell's views, as far as they go, are in _favour_, but they go so\r\nlittle in favour, and so much more is required, that it may <be> viewed as\r\nobjection.] If geology present us with mere pages in chapters, towards\r\nend of <a> history, formed by tearing out bundles of leaves, and each page\r\nillustrating merely a small portion of the organisms of that time, the\r\nfacts accord perfectly with my theory{120}.\r\n\r\n     {120} This simile is more fully given in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p.\r\n     310, vi. p. 452. \"For my part, following out Lyell's metaphor, I\r\n     look at the natural geological record, as a history of the world\r\n     imperfectly kept, and written in a changing dialect; of this\r\n     history we possess the last volume alone, relating only to two or\r\n     three countries. Of this volume, only here and there a short\r\n     chapter has been preserved; and of each page, only here and there a\r\n     few lines. Each word of the slowly-changing language, in which the\r\n     history is supposed to be written, being more or less different in\r\n     the interrupted succession of chapters, may represent the\r\n     apparently abruptly changed forms of life, entombed in our\r\n     consecutive, but widely separated formations.\" Professor Judd has\r\n     been good enough to point out to me, that Darwin's metaphor is\r\n     founded on the comparison of geology to history in Ch. i. of the\r\n     _Principles of Geology_, Ed. i. 1830, vol. i. pp. 1-4. Professor\r\n     Judd has also called my attention to another\r\n     passage,--_Principles_, Ed. i. 1833, vol. iii. p. 33, when Lyell\r\n     imagines an historian examining \"two buried cities at the foot of\r\n     Vesuvius, immediately superimposed upon each other.\" The historian\r\n     would discover that the inhabitants of the lower town were Greeks\r\n     while those of the upper one were Italians. But he would be wrong\r\n     in supposing that there had been a sudden change from the Greek to\r\n     the Italian language in Campania. I think it is clear that Darwin's\r\n     metaphor is partly taken from this passage. See for instance (in\r\n     the above passage from the _Origin_) such phrases as \"history ...\r\n     written in a changing dialect\"--\"apparently abruptly changed forms\r\n     of life.\" The passage within [] in the above paragraph:--\"Lyell's\r\n     views as far as they go &c.,\" no doubt refers, as Professor Judd\r\n     points out, to Lyell not going so far as Darwin on the question of\r\n     the imperfection of the geological record.\r\n\r\n_Extermination._ We have seen that in later periods the organisms have\r\ndisappeared by degrees and [perhaps] probably by degrees in earlier, and\r\nI have said our theory requires it. As many naturalists seem to think\r\nextermination a most mysterious circumstance{121} and call in\r\nastonishing agencies, it is well to recall what we have shown concerning\r\nthe struggle of nature. An exterminating agency is at work with every\r\norganism: we scarcely see it: if robins would increase to thousands in\r\nten years how severe must the process be. How imperceptible a small\r\nincrease: fossils become rare: possibly sudden extermination as\r\nAustralia, but as present means very slow and many means of escape, I\r\nshall doubt very sudden exterminations. Who can explain why some species\r\nabound more,--why does marsh titmouse, or ring-ouzel, now little\r\nchange,--why is one sea-slug rare and another common on our coasts,--why\r\none species of Rhinoceros more than another,--why is <illegible> tiger of\r\nIndia so rare? Curious and general sources of error, the place of an\r\norganism is instantly filled up.\r\n\r\n     {121} On rarity and extinction see _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 109, 319,\r\n     vi. pp. 133, 461.\r\n\r\nWe know state of earth has changed, and as earthquakes and tides go on,\r\nthe state must change,--many geologists believe a slow gradual cooling.\r\nNow let us see in accordance with principles of [variation]\r\nspecification explained in Sect. II. how species would probably be\r\nintroduced and how such results accord with what is known.\r\n\r\nThe first fact geology proclaims is immense number of extinct forms, and\r\nnew appearances. Tertiary strata leads to belief, that forms gradually\r\nbecome rare and disappear and are gradually supplied by others. We see\r\nsome forms now becoming rare and disappearing, we know of no sudden\r\ncreation: in older periods the forms _appear_ to come in suddenly, scene\r\nshifts: but even here Devonian, Permian &c. [keep on supplying new links\r\nin chain]--Genera and higher forms come on and disappear, in same way\r\nleaving a species on one or more stages below that in which the form\r\nabounded.\r\n\r\n\r\n<GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION.>\r\n\r\n§ VI. Let us consider the absolute state of distribution of organisms of\r\nearth's face.\r\n\r\nReferring chiefly, but not exclusively (from difficulty of transport,\r\nfewness, and the distinct characteristics of groups) to Mammalia; and\r\nfirst considering the three or four main [regions] divisions; North\r\nAmerica, Europe, Asia, including greater part of E. Indian Archipelago\r\nand Africa are intimately allied. Africa most distinct, especially most\r\nsouthern parts. And the Arctic regions, which unite N. America, Asia and\r\nEurope, only separated (if we travel one way by Behring's St.) by a\r\nnarrow strait, is most intimately allied, indeed forms but one\r\nrestricted group. Next comes S. America,--then Australia, Madagascar\r\n(and some small islands which stand very remote from the land). Looking\r\nat these main divisions separately, the organisms vary according to\r\nchanges in condition{122} of different parts. But besides this, barriers\r\nof every kind seem to separate regions in a greater degree than\r\nproportionally to the difference of climates on each side. Thus great\r\nchains of mountains, spaces of sea between islands and continents, even\r\ngreat rivers and deserts. In fact the amount <of> difference in the\r\norganisms bears a certain, but not invariable relation to the amount of\r\nphysical difficulties to transit{123}.\r\n\r\n     {122} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 346, vi. p. 493, the author begins\r\n     his discussion on geographical distribution by minimising the\r\n     effect of physical conditions. He lays great stress on the effect\r\n     of _barriers_, as in the present Essay.\r\n\r\n     {123} Note in the original, \"Would it be more striking if we took\r\n     animals, take Rhinoceros, and study their habitats?\"\r\n\r\nThere are some curious exceptions, namely, similarity of fauna of\r\nmountains of Europe and N. America and Lapland. Other cases just <the>\r\nreverse, mountains of eastern S. America, Altai <?>, S. India <?>{124}:\r\nmountain summits of islands often eminently peculiar. Fauna generally of\r\nsome islands, even when close, very dissimilar, in others very similar.\r\n[I am here led to observe one or more centres of creation{125}.]\r\n\r\n     {124} Note by Mr A. R. Wallace. \"The want of similarity referred\r\n     to, is, between the mountains of Brazil and Guiana and those of the\r\n     Andes. Also those of the Indian peninsula as compared with the\r\n     Himalayas. In both cases there is continuous intervening land.\r\n\r\n     \"The islands referred to were, no doubt, the Galapagos for\r\n     dissimilarity from S. America; our own Islands as compared with\r\n     Europe, and perhaps Java, for similarity with continental Asia.\"\r\n\r\n     {125} The arguments against multiple centres of creation are given\r\n     in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 352, vi. p. 499.\r\n\r\nThe simple geologist can explain many of the foregoing cases of\r\ndistribution. Subsidence of a continent in which free means of\r\ndispersal, would drive the lowland plants up to the mountains, now\r\nconverted into islands, and the semi-alpine plants would take place of\r\nalpine, and alpine be destroyed, if mountains originally were not of\r\ngreat height. So we may see, during gradual changes{126} of climate on a\r\ncontinent, the propagation of species would vary and adapt themselves to\r\nsmall changes causing much extermination{127}. The mountains of Europe\r\nwere quite lately covered with ice, and the lowlands probably partaking\r\nof the Arctic climate and Fauna. Then as climate changed, arctic fauna\r\nwould take place of ice, and an inundation of plants from different\r\ntemperate countries <would> seize the lowlands, leaving islands of arctic\r\nforms. But if this had happened on an island, whence could the new forms\r\nhave come,--here the geologist calls in creationists. If island formed,\r\nthe geologist will suggest <that> many of the forms might have been\r\nborne from nearest land, but if peculiar, he calls in creationist,--as\r\nsuch island rises in height &c., he still more calls in creation. The\r\ncreationist tells one, on a <illegible> spot the American spirit of\r\ncreation makes _Orpheus_ and _Tyrannus_ and American doves, and in\r\naccordance with past and extinct forms, but no persistent relation\r\nbetween areas and distribution, Geologico-Geograph.-Distribution.\r\n\r\n     {126} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 366, vi. p. 516, the author does\r\n     not give his views on the distribution of alpine plants as original\r\n     but refers to Edward Forbes' work (_Geolog. Survey Memoirs_, 1846).\r\n     In his autobiography, Darwin refers to this. \"I was forestalled\" he\r\n     says, \"in only one important point, which my vanity has always made\r\n     me regret.\" (_Life and Letters_, i. p. 88.)\r\n\r\n     {127} <The following is written on the back of a page of the MS.>\r\n     Discuss one or more centres of creation: allude strongly to\r\n     facilities of dispersal and amount of geological change: allude to\r\n     mountain-summits afterwards to be referred to. The distribution\r\n     varies, as everyone knows, according to adaptation, explain going\r\n     from N. to S. how we come to fresh groups of species in the same\r\n     general region, but besides this we find difference, according to\r\n     greatness of barriers, in greater proportion than can be well\r\n     accounted for by adaptation. <On representive species see _Origin_,\r\n     Ed. i. p. 349, vi. p. 496.> This very striking when we think of\r\n     cattle of Pampas, plants <?> &c. &c. Then go into discussion; this\r\n     holds with 3 or 4 main divisions as well as the endless minor ones\r\n     in each of these 4 great ones: in these I chiefly refer to mammalia\r\n     &c. &c. The similarity of type, but not in species, in same\r\n     continent has been much less insisted on than the dissimilarity of\r\n     different great regions generically: it is more striking.\r\n\r\n     <I have here omitted an incomprehensible sentence.> Galapagos\r\n     Islands, Tristan d'Acunha, _volcanic_ islands covered with craters\r\n     we know lately did not support any organisms. How unlike these\r\n     islands in nature to neighbouring lands. These facts perhaps more\r\n     striking than almost any others. [Geology apt to affect geography\r\n     therefore we ought to expect to find the above.]\r\n     Geological-geographical distribution. In looking to past times we\r\n     find Australia equally distinct. S. America was distinct, though\r\n     with more forms in common. N. America its nearest neighbour more in\r\n     common,--in some respects more, in some less allied to Europe.\r\n     Europe we find <?> equally European. For Europe is now part of Asia\r\n     though not <illegible>. Africa unknown,--examples, Elephant,\r\n     Rhinoceros, Hippopotamus, Hyaena. As geology destroys geography we\r\n     cannot be surprised in going far back we find Marsupials and\r\n     Edentata in Europe: but geology destroys geography.\r\n\r\nNow according to analogy of domesticated animals let us see what would\r\nresult. Let us take case of farmer on Pampas, where everything\r\napproaches nearer to state of nature. He works on organisms having\r\nstrong tendency to vary: and he knows <that the> only way to make a\r\ndistinct breed is to select and separate. It would be useless to\r\nseparate the best bulls and pair with best cows if their offspring run\r\nloose and bred with the other herds, and tendency to reversion not\r\ncounteracted; he would endeavour therefore to get his cows on islands\r\nand then commence his work of selection. If several farmers in different\r\n_rincons_{128} were to set to work, especially if with different\r\nobjects, several breeds would soon be produced. So would it be with\r\nhorticulturist and so history of every plant shows; the number of\r\nvarieties{129} increase in proportion to care bestowed on their\r\nselection and, with crossing plants, separation. Now, according to this\r\nanalogy, change of external conditions, and isolation either by chance\r\nlanding <of> a form on an island, or subsidence dividing a continent, or\r\ngreat chain of mountains, and the number of individuals not being\r\nnumerous will best favour variation and selection{130}. No doubt change\r\ncould be effected in same country without any barrier by long continued\r\nselection on one species: even in case of a plant not capable of\r\ncrossing would easier get possession and solely occupy an island{131}.\r\nNow we can at once see that <if> two parts of a continent isolated, new\r\nspecies thus generated in them, would have closest affinities, like\r\ncattle in counties of England: if barrier afterwards destroyed one\r\nspecies might destroy the other or both keep their ground. So if island\r\nformed near continent, let it be ever so different, that continent would\r\nsupply inhabitants, and new species (like the old) would be allied with\r\nthat continent. An island generally very different soil and climate, and\r\nnumber and order of inhabitants supplied by chance, no point so\r\nfavourable for generation of new species{132},--especially the\r\nmountains, hence, so it is. As isolated mountains formed in a plain\r\ncountry (if such happens) is an island. As other islands formed, the old\r\nspecies would spread and thus extend and the fauna of distant island\r\nmight ultimately meet and a continent formed between them. No one doubts\r\ncontinents formed by repeated elevations and depressions{133}. In\r\nlooking backwards, but not so far that all geographical boundaries are\r\ndestroyed, we can thus at once see why existing forms are related to the\r\nextinct in the same manner as existing ones are in some part of existing\r\ncontinent. By chance we might even have one or two absolute parent\r\nfossils.\r\n\r\n     {128} _Rincon_ in Spanish means a _nook_ or _corner_, it is here\r\n     probably used to mean a small farm.\r\n\r\n     {129} The following is written across the page: \"No one would\r\n     expect a set of similar varieties to be produced in the different\r\n     countries, so species different.\"\r\n\r\n     {130} <The following passage seems to have been meant to follow\r\n     here.> The parent of an organism, we may generally suppose to be in\r\n     less favourable condition than the selected offspring and therefore\r\n     generally in fewer numbers. (This is not borne out by horticulture,\r\n     mere hypothesis; as an organism in favourable conditions might by\r\n     selection be adapted to still more favourable conditions.)\r\n\r\n     Barrier would further act in preventing species formed in one part\r\n     migrating to another part.\r\n\r\n     {131} <The following notes occur on the back of the page.> Number\r\n     of species not related to capabilities of the country: furthermore\r\n     not always those best adapted, perhaps explained by creationists by\r\n     changes and progress. <See p. 34, note 1.{Note 134}>\r\n\r\n     Although creationists can, by help of geology, explain much, how\r\n     can he explain the marked relation of past and present in same\r\n     area, the varying relation in other cases, between past and\r\n     present, the relation of different parts of same great area. If\r\n     island, to adjoining continent, if quite different, on mountain\r\n     summits,--the number of individuals not being related to\r\n     capabilities, or how &c.--our theory, I believe, can throw much\r\n     light and all facts accord.\r\n\r\n     {132} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 390, vi. p. 543.\r\n\r\n     {133} On oscillation see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 291, vi. p. 426.\r\n\r\nThe detection of transitional forms would be rendered more difficult on\r\nrising point of land.\r\n\r\nThe distribution therefore in the above enumerated points, even the\r\ntrivial ones, which on any other <theory?> can be viewed as so many\r\nultimate facts, all follow <in> a simple manner on the theory of the\r\noccurrence of species by <illegible> and being adapted by selection to\r\n<illegible>, conjoined with their power of dispersal, and the steady\r\ngeographico-geological changes which are now in progress and which\r\nundoubtedly have taken place. Ought to state the opinion of the\r\nimmutability of species and the creation by so many separate acts of\r\nwill of the Creator{134}.\r\n\r\n     {134} <From the back of MS.> Effect of climate on stationary island\r\n     and on continent, but continent once island. Moreover repeated\r\n     oscillations fresh diffusion when non-united, then isolation, when\r\n     rising again immigration prevented, new habitats formed, new\r\n     species, when united free immigration, hence uniform characters.\r\n     Hence more forms <on?> the island. Mountain summits. Why not true\r\n     species. First let us recall in Part I, conditions of variation:\r\n     change of conditions during several generations, and if frequently\r\n     altered so much better [perhaps excess of food]. Secondly, continued\r\n     selection [while in wild state]. Thirdly, isolation in all or nearly\r\n     all,--as well to recall advantages of.\r\n\r\n     [In continent, if we look to terrestrial animal, long continued\r\n     change might go on, which would only cause change in numerical\r\n     number <? proportions>: if continued long enough might ultimately\r\n     affect all, though to most continents <there is> chance of\r\n     immigration. Some few of whole body of species must be long affected\r\n     and entire selection working same way. But here isolation absent,\r\n     without barrier, cut off such <illegible>. We can see advantage of\r\n     isolation. But let us take case of island thrown up by volcanic\r\n     agency at some distances, here we should have occasional visitants,\r\n     only in few numbers and exposed to new conditions and <illegible>\r\n     more important,--a quite new grouping of organic beings, which would\r\n     open out new sources of subsistence, or <would> control <?> old\r\n     ones. The number would be few, can old have the very best opportunity.\r\n     <The conquest of the indigenes by introduced organisms shows that\r\n     the indigenes were not perfectly adapted, see _Origin_, Ed. i. p.\r\n     390.> Moreover as the island continued changing,--continued slow\r\n     changes, river, marshes, lakes, mountains &c. &c., new races as\r\n     successively formed and a fresh occasional visitant.\r\n\r\n     If island formed continent, some species would emerge and\r\n     immigrate. Everyone admits continents. We can see why Galapagos and\r\n     C. Verde differ <see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 398>], depressed and raised.\r\n     We can see from this repeated action and the time required for a\r\n     continent, why many more forms than in New Zealand <see _Origin_,\r\n     Ed. i. p. 389 for a comparison between New Zealand and the Cape> no\r\n     mammals or other classes <see however, _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 393 for\r\n     the case of the frog>. We can at once see how it comes when there\r\n     has been an old channel of migration,--Cordilleras; we can see why\r\n     Indian Asiatic Flora,--[why species] having a wide range gives\r\n     better chance of some arriving at new points and being selected, and\r\n     adapted to new ends. I need hardly remark no necessity for change.\r\n\r\n     Finally, as continent (most extinction <?> during formation of\r\n     continent) is formed after repeated elevation and depression, and\r\n     interchange of species we might foretell much extinction, and that\r\n     the survivor would belong to same type, as the extinct, in same\r\n     manner as different part of same continent, which were once\r\n     separated by space as they are by time <see _Origin_, Ed. i. pp.\r\n     339 and 349>.\r\n\r\n     As all mammals have descended from one stock, we ought to expect\r\n     that every continent has been at some time connected, hence\r\n     obliteration of present ranges. I do not mean that the fossil\r\n     mammifers found in S. America are the lineal successors <ancestors>\r\n     of the present forms of S. America: for it is highly improbable\r\n     that more than one or two cases (who will say how many races after\r\n     Plata bones) should be found. I believe this from numbers, who have\r\n     lived,--mere <?> chance of fewness. Moreover in every case from\r\n     very existence of genera and species only few at one time will\r\n     leave progeny, under form of new species, to distant ages; and the\r\n     more distant the ages the fewer the progenitors. An observation may\r\n     be here appended, bad chance of preservation on rising island, the\r\n     nurseries of new species, appeal to experience <see _Origin_, Ed.\r\n     i. p. 292>. This observation may be extended, that in all cases,\r\n     subsiding land must be, in early stages, less favourable to\r\n     formation of new species; but it will isolate them, and then if\r\n     land recommences rising how favourable. As preoccupation is bar to\r\n     diffusion to species, so would it be to a selected variety. But it\r\n     would not be if that variety was better fitted to some not fully\r\n     occupied station; so during elevation or the formation of new\r\n     stations, is scene for new species. But during elevation not\r\n     favourable to preservation of fossil (except in caverns <?>); when\r\n     subsidence highly favourable in early stages to preservation of\r\n     fossils; when subsidence, less sediment. So that our strata, as\r\n     general rule will be the tomb of old species (not undergoing any\r\n     change) when rising land the nursery. But if there be vestige will\r\n     generally be preserved to future ages, the new ones will not be\r\n     entombed till fresh subsidence supervenes. In this long gap we\r\n     shall have no record: so that wonderful if we should get\r\n     transitional forms. I do not mean every stage, for we cannot expect\r\n     that, as before shown, until geologists will be prepared to say\r\n     that although under unnaturally favourable condition we can trace\r\n     in future ages short-horn and Herefordshire <see note 2, p. 26>.\r\n     {Note 115}\r\n\r\n\r\n§ VII. <AFFINITIES AND CLASSIFICATION.>\r\n\r\nLooking now to the affinities of organisms, without relation to their\r\ndistribution, and taking all fossil and recent, we see the degrees of\r\nrelationship are of different degrees and\r\narbitrary,--sub-genera,--genera,--sub-families, families, orders and\r\nclasses and kingdoms. The kind of classification which everyone feels is\r\nmost correct is called the natural system, but no can define this. If we\r\nsay with Whewell <that we have an> undefined instinct of the importance\r\nof organs{135}, we have no means in lower animals of saying which is\r\nmost important, and yet everyone feels that some one system alone\r\ndeserves to be called natural. The true relationship of organisms is\r\nbrought before one by considering relations of analogy, an otter-like\r\nanimal amongst mammalia and an otter amongst marsupials. In such cases\r\nexternal resemblance and habit of life and _the final end of whole\r\norganization_ very strong, yet no relation{136}. Naturalists cannot\r\navoid these terms of relation and affinity though they use them\r\nmetaphorically. If used in simple earnestness the natural system ought\r\nto be a genealogical <one>; and our knowledge of the points which are\r\nmost easily affected in transmission are those which we least value in\r\nconsidering the natural system, and practically when we find they do\r\nvary we regard them of less value{137}. In classifying varieties the\r\nsame language is used and the same kind of division: here also (in\r\npine-apple){138} we talk of the natural classification, overlooking\r\nsimilarity of the fruits, because whole plant differs. The origin of\r\nsub-genera, genera, &c., &c., is not difficult on notion of genealogical\r\nsuccession, and accords with what we know of similar gradations of\r\naffinity in domesticated organisms. In the same region the organic\r\nbeings are <illegible> related to each other and the external conditions\r\nin many physical respects are allied{139} and their differences of same\r\nkind, and therefore when a new species has been selected and has\r\nobtained a place in the economy of nature, we may suppose that\r\ngenerally it will tend to extend its range during geographical changes,\r\nand thus, becoming isolated and exposed to new conditions, will slightly\r\nalter and its structure by selection become slightly remodified, thus we\r\nshould get species of a sub-genus and genus,--as varieties of\r\nmerino-sheep,--varieties of British and Indian cattle. Fresh species\r\nmight go on forming and others become extinct and all might become\r\nextinct, and then we should have <an> extinct genus; a case formerly\r\nmentioned, of which numerous cases occur in Palæontology. But more often\r\nthe same advantages which caused the new species to spread and become\r\nmodified into several species would favour some of the species being\r\npreserved: and if two of the species, considerably different, each gave\r\nrise to group of new species, you would have two genera; the same thing\r\nwill go on. We may look at case in other way, looking to future.\r\nAccording to mere chance every existing species may generate another,\r\nbut if any species, A, in changing gets an advantage and that advantage\r\n(whatever it may be, intellect, &c., &c., or some particular structure\r\nor constitution) is inherited{140}, A will be the progenitor of several\r\ngenera or even families in the hard struggle of nature. A will go on\r\nbeating out other forms, it might come that A would people earth,--we\r\nmay now not have one descendant on our globe of the one or several\r\noriginal creations{141}. External conditions air, earth, water being\r\nsame{142} on globe, and the communication not being perfect, organisms\r\nof widely different descent might become adapted to the same end and\r\nthen we should have cases of analogy{143}, [they might even tend to\r\nbecome numerically representative]. From this often happening each of\r\nthe great divisions of nature would have their representative eminently\r\nadapted to earth, to <air>{144}, to water, and to these in <illegible>\r\nand then these great divisions would show numerical relations in their\r\nclassification.\r\n\r\n     {135} After \"organs\" is inserted, apparently as an\r\n     afterthought:--\"no, and instance metamorphosis, afterwards\r\n     explicable.\"\r\n\r\n     {136} For analogical resemblances see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 427, vi.\r\n     p. 582.\r\n\r\n     {137} \"Practically when naturalists are at work, they do not\r\n     trouble themselves about the physiological value of the\r\n     characters.... If they find a character nearly uniform, ... they\r\n     use it as one of high value,\" _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 417, vi. p. 573.\r\n\r\n     {138} \"We are cautioned ... not to class two varieties of the\r\n     pine-apple together, merely because their fruit, though the most\r\n     important part, happens to be nearly identical,\" _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     p. 423, vi. p. 579.\r\n\r\n     {139} The whole of this passage is obscure, but the text is quite\r\n     clear, except for one illegible word.\r\n\r\n     {140} <The exact position of the following passage is uncertain:>\r\n     \"just as it is not likely every present breed of fancy birds\r\n     and cattle will propagate, only some of the best.\"\r\n\r\n     {141} This suggests that the author was not far from the principle\r\n     of divergence on which he afterwards laid so much stress. See\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 111, vi. p. 134, also _Life and Letters_, i. p.\r\n     84.\r\n\r\n     {142} That is to say the same conditions occurring in different\r\n     parts of the globe.\r\n\r\n     {143} The position of the following is uncertain, \"greyhound and\r\n     racehorse have an analogy to each other.\" The same comparison\r\n     occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 427, vi. p. 583.\r\n\r\n     {144} _Air_ is evidently intended; in the MS. _water_ is written\r\n     twice.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ VIII. UNITY [OR SIMILARITY] OF TYPE IN THE GREAT CLASSES.\r\n\r\nNothing more wonderful in Nat. Hist. than looking at the vast number of\r\norganisms, recent and fossil, exposed to the most diverse conditions,\r\nliving in the most distant climes, and at immensely remote periods,\r\nfitted to wholely different ends, yet to find large groups united by a\r\nsimilar type of structure. When we for instance see bat, horse,\r\nporpoise-fin, hand, all built on same structure{145}, having bones{146}\r\nwith same name, we see there is some deep bond of union between\r\nthem{147}, to illustrate this is the foundation and objects <?> <of>\r\nwhat is called the Natural System; and which is foundation of\r\ndistinction <?> of true and adaptive characters{148}. Now this wonderful\r\nfact of hand, hoof, wing, paddle and claw being the same, is at once\r\nexplicable on the principle of some parent-forms, which might either be\r\n<illegible> or walking animals, becoming through infinite number of small\r\nselections adapted to various conditions. We know that proportion,\r\nsize, shape of bones and their accompanying soft parts vary, and hence\r\nconstant selection would alter, to almost any purpose <?> the framework\r\nof an organism, but yet would leave a general, even closest similarity in\r\nit.\r\n\r\n     {145} Written between the lines occurs:--\"extend to birds and other\r\n     classes.\"\r\n\r\n     {146} Written between the lines occurs:--\"many bones merely\r\n     represented.\"\r\n\r\n     {147} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 434, vi. p. 595, the term\r\n     _morphology_ is taken as including _unity of type_. The paddle of\r\n     the porpoise and the wing of the bat are there used as instances of\r\n     morphological resemblance.\r\n\r\n     {148} The sentence is difficult to decipher.\r\n\r\n[We know the number of similar parts, as vertebræ and ribs can vary,\r\nhence this also we might expect.] Also <if> the changes carried on to a\r\ncertain point, doubtless type will be lost, and this is case with\r\nPlesiosaurus{149}. The unity of type in past and present ages of certain\r\ngreat divisions thus undoubtedly receives the simplest explanation.\r\n\r\n     {149} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 436, vi. p. 598, the author speaks\r\n     of the \"general pattern\" being obscured in the paddles of \"extinct\r\n     gigantic sea-lizards.\"\r\n\r\nThere is another class of allied and almost identical facts, admitted by\r\nthe soberest physiologists, [from the study of a certain set of organs\r\nin a group of organisms] and refers <? referring> to a unity of type of\r\ndifferent organs in the same individual, denominated the science of\r\n\"Morphology.\" The <? this> discovered by beautiful and regular series,\r\nand in the case of plants from monstrous changes, that certain organs in\r\nan individual are other organs metamorphosed. Thus every botanist\r\nconsiders petals, nectaries, stamens, pistils, germen as metamorphosed\r\nleaf. They thus explain, in the most lucid manner, the position and\r\nnumber of all parts of the flower, and the curious conversion under\r\ncultivation of one part into another. The complicated double set of jaws\r\nand palpi of crustaceans{150}, and all insects are considered as\r\nmetamorphosed <limbs> and to see the series is to admit this phraseology.\r\nThe skulls of the vertebrates are undoubtedly composed of three\r\nmetamorphosed vertebræ; thus we can understand the strange form of the\r\nseparate bones which compose the casket holding man's brain. These{151}\r\nfacts differ but slightly from those of last section, if with wing,\r\npaddle, hand and hoof, some common structure was yet visible, or could\r\nbe made out by a series of occasional monstrous conversions, and if\r\ntraces could be discovered of <the> whole having once existed as walking or\r\nswimming instruments, these organs would be said to be metamorphosed, as\r\nit is they are only said to exhibit a common type.\r\n\r\n     {150} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 437, vi. p. 599.\r\n\r\n     {151} The following passage seems to have been meant to precede the\r\n     sentence beginning \"These facts\":--\"It is evident, that when in\r\n     each individual species, organs are metamorph. a unity of type\r\n     extends.\"\r\n\r\nThis distinction is not drawn by physiologists, and is only implied by\r\nsome by their general manner of writing. These facts, though affecting\r\nevery organic being on the face of the globe, which has existed, or does\r\nexist, can only be viewed by the Creationist as ultimate and\r\ninexplicable facts. But this unity of type through the individuals of a\r\ngroup, and this metamorphosis of the same organ into other organs,\r\nadapted to diverse use, necessarily follows on the theory of\r\ndescent{152}. For let us take case of Vertebrata, which if{153} they\r\ndescended from one parent and by this theory all the Vertebrata have\r\nbeen altered by slow degrees, such as we see in domestic animals. We\r\nknow that proportions alter, and even that occasionally numbers of\r\nvertebræ alter, that parts become soldered, that parts are lost, as tail\r\nand toes, but we know <that?> here we can see that possibly a walking organ\r\nmight <?> be converted into swimming or into a gliding organ and so on to a\r\nflying organ. But such gradual changes would not alter the unity of type\r\nin their descendants, as parts lost and soldered and vertebræ. But we\r\ncan see that if this carried to extreme, unity lost,--Plesiosaurus. Here\r\nwe have seen the same organ is formed <?> <for> different purposes\r\n<ten words illegible>: and if, in several orders of vertebrata, we could\r\ntrace origin <of> spinous processes and monstrosities &c. we should say,\r\ninstead of there existing a unity of type, morphology{154}, as we do\r\nwhen we trace the head as being the vertebræ metamorphosed. Be it\r\nobserved that Naturalists, as they use terms of affinity without\r\nattaching real meaning, here also they are obliged to use metamorphosis,\r\nwithout meaning that any parent of crustacean was really an animal with\r\nas many legs as crustacean has jaws. The theory of descent at once\r\nexplains these wonderful facts.\r\n\r\n     {152} This is, I believe, the first place in which the author uses\r\n     the words \"theory of descent.\"\r\n\r\n     {153} The sentence should probably run, \"Let us take the case of\r\n     the vertebrata: if we assume them to be descended from one parent,\r\n     then by this theory they have been altered &c.\"\r\n\r\n     {154} That is \"we should call it a morphological fact.\"\r\n\r\nNow few of the physiologists who use this language really suppose that\r\nthe parent of insect with the metamorphosed jaw, was an insect with\r\n[more] so many legs, or that the parent of flowering plants, originally\r\nhad no stamens, or pistils or petals, but some other means of\r\npropagation,--and so in other cases. Now according to our theory during\r\nthe infinite number of changes, we might expect that an organ used for a\r\npurpose might be used for a different one by his descendant, as must\r\nhave been the case by our theory with the bat, porpoise, horse, &c.,\r\nwhich are descended from one parent. And if it so chanced that traces of\r\nthe former use and structure of the part should be retained, which is\r\nmanifestly possible if not probable, then we should have the organs, on\r\nwhich morphology is founded and which instead of being metaphorical\r\nbecomes plain and <and instead of being> utterly unintelligible becomes\r\nsimple matter of fact{155}.\r\n\r\n     {155} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 438, vi. p. 602, the author,\r\n     referring to the expressions used by naturalists in regard to\r\n     morphology and metamorphosis, says \"On my view these terms may be\r\n     used literally.\"\r\n\r\n<_Embryology._> This general unity of type in great groups of organisms\r\n(including of course these morphological cases) displays itself in a\r\nmost striking manner in the stages through which the foetus passes{156}.\r\nIn early stage, the wing of bat, hoof, hand, paddle are not to be\r\ndistinguished. At a still earlier <stage> there is no difference between\r\nfish, bird, &c. &c. and mammal. It is not that they cannot be\r\ndistinguished, but the arteries{157} <illegible>. It is not true that\r\none passes through the form of a lower group, though no doubt fish more\r\nnearly related to foetal state{158}.\r\n\r\n     {156} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 439, vi. p. 605.\r\n\r\n     {157} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 440, vi. p. 606, the author argues\r\n     that the \"loop-like course of the arteries\" in the vertebrate\r\n     embryo has no direct relation to the conditions of existence.\r\n\r\n     {158} The following passages are written across the page:--\"They\r\n     pass through the same phases, but some, generally called the higher\r\n     groups, are further metamorphosed.\r\n\r\n     ? Degradation and complication? no tendency to perfection.\r\n\r\n     ? Justly argued against Lamarck?\"\r\n\r\nThis similarity at the earliest stage is remarkably shown in the course\r\nof the arteries which become greatly altered, as foetus advances in life\r\nand assumes the widely different course and number which characterize\r\nfull-grown fish and mammals. How wonderful that in egg, in water or air,\r\nor in womb of mother, artery{159} should run in same course.\r\n\r\n     {159} An almost identical passage occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p.\r\n     440, vi. p. 606.\r\n\r\nLight can be thrown on this by our theory. The structure of each\r\norganism is chiefly adapted to the sustension of its life, when\r\nfull-grown, when it has to feed itself and propagate{160}. The structure\r\nof a kitten is quite in secondary degree adapted to its habits, whilst\r\nfed by its mother's milk and prey. Hence variation in the structure of\r\nthe full-grown species will _chiefly_ determine the preservation of a\r\nspecies now become ill-suited to its habitat, or rather with a better\r\nplace opened to it in the economy of Nature. It would not matter to the\r\nfull-grown cat whether in its young state it was more or less eminently\r\nfeline, so that it become so when full-grown. No doubt most variation,\r\n(not depending on habits of life of individual) depends on early\r\nchange{161} and we must suspect that at whatever time of life the\r\nalteration of foetus is effected, it tends to appear at same period.\r\nWhen we <see> a tendency to particular disease in old age transmitted by\r\nthe male, we know some effect is produced during conception, on the\r\nsimple cell of ovule, which will not produce its effect till half a\r\ncentury afterwards and that effect is not visible{162}. So we see in\r\ngrey-hound, bull-dog, in race-horse and cart-horse, which have been\r\nselected for their form in full-life, there is much less (?) difference\r\nin the few first days after birth{163}, than when full-grown: so in\r\ncattle, we see it clearly in cases of cattle, which differ obviously in\r\nshape and length of horns. If man were during 10,000 years to be able to\r\nselect, far more diverse animals from horse or cow, I should expect\r\nthere would be far less differences in the very young and foetal state:\r\nand this, I think, throws light on above marvellous fact. In larvæ,\r\nwhich have long life selection, perhaps, does much,--in the pupa not so\r\nmuch{164} There is no object gained in varying form &c. of foetus\r\n(beyond certain adaptations to mother's womb) and therefore selection\r\nwill not further act on it, than in giving to its changing tissues a\r\ntendency to certain parts afterwards to assume certain forms.\r\n\r\n     {160} The following: \"Deaths of brothers <when> old by same peculiar\r\n     disease\" which is written between the lines seems to have been a\r\n     memorandum which is expanded a few lines lower. I believe the case\r\n     of the brothers came from Dr R. W. Darwin.\r\n\r\n     {161} See the discussion to this effect in the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp.\r\n     443-4, vi. p. 610. The author there makes the distinction between a\r\n     cause affecting the germ-cell and the reaction occurring at a late\r\n     period of life.\r\n\r\n     {162} Possibly the sentence was meant to end \"is not visible till\r\n     then.\"\r\n\r\n     {163} See _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 444-5, vi. p. 611. The query\r\n     appended to _much less_ is justified, since measurement was\r\n     necessary to prove that the greyhound and bulldog puppies had not\r\n     nearly acquired \"their full amount of proportional difference.\"\r\n\r\n     {164} <The following discussion, from the back of the page, is in\r\n     large measure the same as the text.> I think light can be thrown on\r\n     these facts. From the following peculiarities being hereditary, [we\r\n     know that some change in the germinal vesicle is effected, which\r\n     will only betray itself years after] diseases--man, goitre, gout,\r\n     baldness, fatness, size, [longevity <illegible> time of reproduction,\r\n     shape of horns, case of old brothers dying of same disease]. And we\r\n     know that the germinal vesicle must have been affected, though no\r\n     effect is apparent or can be apparent till years afterwards,--no\r\n     more apparent than when these peculiarities appear by the exposure\r\n     of the full-grown individual. <That is, \"the young individual is as\r\n     apparently free from the hereditary changes which will appear\r\n     later, as the young is actually free from the changes produced by\r\n     exposure to certain conditions in adult life.\"> So that when we see\r\n     a variety in cattle, even if the variety be due to act of\r\n     reproduction, we cannot feel sure at what period this change became\r\n     apparent. It may have been effected during early age of free life\r\n     <or> foetal existence, as monsters show. From arguments before used,\r\n     and crossing, we may generally suspect in germ; but I repeat it\r\n     does not follow, that the change should be apparent till life fully\r\n     developed; any more than fatness depending on heredity should be\r\n     apparent during early childhood, still less during foetal\r\n     existence. In case of horns of cattle, which when inherited must\r\n     depend on germinal vesicle, obviously no effect till cattle\r\n     full-grown. Practically it would appear that the [hereditary]\r\n     peculiarities characterising our domestic races, therefore\r\n     resulting from vesicle, do not appear with their full characters\r\n     in very early states; thus though two breeds of cows have calves\r\n     different, they are not so different,--grey-hound and bull-dog.\r\n     And this is what is <to> be expected, for man is indifferent to\r\n     characters of young animals and hence would select those full-grown\r\n     animals which possessed the desirable characteristics. So that from\r\n     mere chance we might expect that some of the characters would be\r\n     such only as became fully apparent in mature life. Furthermore we\r\n     may suspect it to be a law, that at whatever time a new character\r\n     appears, whether from vesicle, or effects of external conditions,\r\n     it would appear at corresponding time <see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 444>.\r\n     Thus diseases appearing in old age produce children with d^o.,--early\r\n     maturity,--longevity,--old men, brothers, of same disease--young\r\n     children of d^o. I said men do not select for quality of\r\n     young,--calf with big bullocks. Silk-worms, peculiarities which,\r\n     appear in caterpillar state or cocoon state, are transmitted to\r\n     corresponding states. The effect of this would be that if some\r\n     peculiarity was born in a young animal, but never exercised, it\r\n     might be inherited in young animal; but if exercised that part of\r\n     structure would be increased and would be inherited in\r\n     corresponding time of life after such training.\r\n\r\n     I have said that man selects in full-life, so would it be in\r\n     Nature. In struggle of existence, it matters nothing to a feline\r\n     animal, whether kitten eminently feline, as long as it sucks.\r\n     Therefore natural selection would act equally well on character\r\n     which was fully <developed> only in full age. Selection could tend\r\n     to alter no character in foetus, (except relation to mother) it would\r\n     alter less in young state (putting on one side larva condition) but\r\n     alter every part in full-grown condition. Look to a foetus and its\r\n     parent, and again after ages foetus and its <i. e. the above\r\n     mentioned parents> descendant; the parent more variable <?> than\r\n     foetus, which explains all.]\r\n\r\nThus there is no power to change the course of the arteries, as long as\r\nthey nourish the foetus; it is the selection of slight changes which\r\nsupervene at any time during <illegible> of life.\r\n\r\nThe less differences of foetus,--this has obvious meaning on this view:\r\notherwise how strange that a [monkey] horse, a man, a bat should at one\r\ntime of life have arteries, running in a manner, which is only\r\nintelligibly useful in a fish! The natural system being on theory\r\ngenealogical, we can at once see, why foetus, retaining traces of the\r\nancestral form, is of the highest value in classification.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ IX. <ABORTIVE ORGANS.>\r\n\r\nThere is another grand class of facts relating to what are called\r\nabortive organs. These consist of organs which the same reasoning power\r\nthat shows us how beautifully these organs in some cases are adapted to\r\ncertain end, declares in other cases are absolutely useless. Thus teeth\r\nin Rhinoceros{165}, whale, narwhal,--bone on tibia, muscles which do not\r\nmove,--little bone of wing of Apteryx,--bone representing extremities in\r\nsome snake,--little wings within <?> soldered cover of beetles,--men and\r\nbulls, mammæ: filaments without anthers in plants, mere scales\r\nrepresenting petals in others, in feather-hyacinth whole flower. Almost\r\ninfinitely numerous. No one can reflect on these without astonishment,\r\ncan anything be clearer than that wings are to fly and teeth <to bite>,\r\nand yet we find these organs perfect in every detail in situations where\r\nthey cannot possibly be of their normal use{166}.\r\n\r\n     {165} Some of these examples occur in _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 450-51,\r\n     vi. pp. 619-20.\r\n\r\n     {166} The two following sentences are written, one down the margin,\r\n     the other across the page. \"Abortive organs eminently useful in\r\n     classification. Embryonic state of organs. Rudiments of organs.\"\r\n\r\nThe term abortive organ has been thus applied to above structure (as\r\n_invariable_ as all other parts{167}) from their absolute similarity to\r\nmonstrous cases, where from _accident_, certain organs are not\r\ndeveloped; as infant without arms or fingers with mere stump\r\nrepresenting them: teeth represented by mere points of ossification:\r\nheadless children with mere button,--viscera represented by small\r\namorphous masses, &c.,--the tail by mere stump,--a solid horn by minute\r\nhanging one{168}. There is a tendency in all these cases, when life is\r\npreserved, for such structures to become hereditary. We see it in\r\ntailless dogs and cats. In plants we see this strikingly,--in Thyme, in\r\n_Linum flavum_,--stamen in _Geranium pyrenaicum_{169}. Nectaries abort\r\ninto petals in Columbine <_Aquilegia_>, produced from some accident and\r\nthen become hereditary, in some cases only when propagated by buds, in\r\nother cases by seed. These cases have been produced suddenly by accident\r\nin early growth, but it is part of law of growth that when any organ is\r\nnot used it tends to diminish (duck's wing{170}?) muscles of dog's ears,\r\n<and of> rabbits, muscles wither, arteries grow up. When eye born\r\ndefective, optic nerve (Tuco Tuco) is atrophied. As every part whether\r\nuseful or not (diseases, double flowers) tends to be transmitted to\r\noffspring, the origin of abortive organs whether produced at the birth\r\nor slowly acquired is easily understood in domestic races of organisms:\r\n[a struggle between the atrophy and hereditariness. Abortive organs in\r\ndomestic races.] There will always be a struggle between atrophy of an\r\norgan rendered useless, and hereditariness{171}. Because we can\r\nunderstand the origin of abortive organs in certain cases, it would be\r\nwrong to conclude absolutely that all must have had same origin, but the\r\nstrongest analogy is in favour of it. And we can by our theory, for\r\nduring infinite changes some organ, we might have anticipated, would\r\nhave become useless. <We can> readily explain the fact, so astounding\r\non any other view, namely that organs possibly useless have been formed\r\noften with the same exquisite care as when of vital importance.\r\n\r\n     {167} I imagine the meaning to be that abortive organs are specific\r\n     characters in contrast to monstrosities.\r\n\r\n     {168} Minute hanging horns are mentioned in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p.\r\n     454, vi. p. 625, as occurring in hornless breeds of cattle.\r\n\r\n     {169} _Linum flavum_ is dimorphic: thyme gynodiæcious. It is not\r\n     clear what point is referred to under _Geranium pyrenaicum_.\r\n\r\n     {170} The author's work on duck's wings &c. is in _Var. under\r\n     Dom._, Ed. 2, i. p. 299.\r\n\r\n     {171} The words _vis medicatrix_ are inserted after \"useless,\"\r\n     apparently as a memorandum.\r\n\r\nOur theory, I may remark would permit an organ <to> become abortive with\r\nrespect to its primary use, to be turned to any other purpose, (as the\r\nbuds in a cauliflower) thus we can see no difficulty in bones of male\r\nmarsupials being used as fulcrum of muscles, or style of\r\nmarygold{172},--indeed in one point of view, the heads of [vertebrated]\r\nanimal may be said to be abortive vertebræ turned into other use: legs\r\nof some crustacea abortive jaws, &c., &c. De Candolle's analogy of table\r\ncovered with dishes{173}.\r\n\r\n     {172} In the male florets of certain Compositæ the style functions\r\n     merely as a piston for forcing out the pollen.\r\n\r\n     {173} <On the back of the page is the following.> If abortive organs\r\n     are a trace preserved by hereditary tendency, of organ in ancestor\r\n     of use, we can at once see why important in natural classification,\r\n     also why more plain in young animal because, as in last section, the\r\n     selection has altered the old animal most. I repeat, these wondrous\r\n     facts, of parts created for no use in past and present time, all\r\n     can by my theory receive simple explanation; or they receive none\r\n     and we must be content with some such empty metaphor, as that of De\r\n     Candolle, who compares creation to a well covered table, and says\r\n     abortive organs may be compared to the dishes (some should be empty)\r\n     placed symmetrically!\r\n\r\n<The following passage was possibly intended to be inserted here.>\r\nDegradation and complication see Lamarck: no tendency to perfection: if\r\nroom, [even] high organism would have greater power in beating lower\r\none, thought <?> to be selected for a degraded end.\r\n\r\n\r\n§ X. RECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nLet us recapitulate the whole <?> <of> these latter sections by taking\r\ncase of the three species of Rhinoceros, which inhabit Java, Sumatra,\r\nand mainland of Malacca or India. We find these three close neighbours,\r\noccupants of distinct but neighbouring districts, as a group having a\r\ndifferent aspect from the Rhinoceros of Africa, though some of these\r\nlatter inhabit very similar countries, but others most diverse stations.\r\nWe find them intimately related [scarcely <?> differences more than some\r\nbreeds of cattle] in structure to the Rhinoceros, which for immense\r\nperiods have inhabited this one, out of three main zoological divisions\r\nof the world. Yet some of these ancient animals were fitted to very\r\ndifferent stations: we find all three <illegible> of the generic character\r\nof the Rhinoceros, which form a [piece of net]{174} set of links in the\r\nbroken chain representing the Pachydermata, as the chain likewise forms\r\na portion in other and longer chains. We see this wonderfully in\r\ndissecting the coarse leg of all three and finding nearly the same bones\r\nas in bat's wings or man's hand, but we see the clear mark in solid\r\ntibia of the fusion into it of the fibula. In all three we find their\r\nheads composed of three altered vertebræ, short neck, same bones as\r\ngiraffe. In the upper jaws of all three we find small teeth like\r\nrabbit's. In dissecting them in foetal state we find at a not very early\r\nstage their form exactly alike the most different animals, and even with\r\narteries running as in a fish: and this similarity holds when the young\r\none is produced in womb, pond, egg or spawn. Now these three undoubted\r\nspecies scarcely differ more than breeds of cattle, are probably\r\nsubject to many the same contagious diseases; if domesticated these\r\nforms would vary, and they might possibly breed together, and fuse into\r\nsomething{175} different <from> their aboriginal forms; might be selected\r\nto serve different ends.\r\n\r\n     {174} The author doubtless meant that the complex relationships\r\n     between organisms can be roughly represented by a net in which the\r\n     knots stand for species.\r\n\r\n     {175} Between the lines occurs:--\"one <?> form be lost.\"\r\n\r\nNow the Creationist believes these three Rhinoceroses were created{176}\r\nwith their deceptive appearance of true, not <illegible> relationship;\r\nas well can I believe the planets revolve in their present courses not\r\nfrom one law of gravity but from distinct volition of Creator.\r\n\r\n     {176} The original sentence is here broken up by the insertion\r\n     of:--\"out of the dust of Java, Sumatra, these <?> allied to past\r\n     and present age and <illegible>, with the stamp of inutility in\r\n     some of their organs and conversion in others.\"\r\n\r\nIf real species, sterile one with another, differently adapted, now\r\ninhabiting different countries, with different structures and instincts,\r\nare admitted to have common descent, we can only legitimately stop where\r\nour facts stop. Look how far in some case a chain of species will lead\r\nus. <This probably refers to the Crustacea, where the two ends of the\r\nseries have \"hardly a character in common.\" _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 419.>\r\nMay we not jump (considering how much extermination, and how imperfect\r\ngeological records) from one sub-genus to another sub-genus. Can genera\r\nrestrain us; many of the same arguments, which made us give up species,\r\ninexorably demand genera and families and orders to fall, and classes\r\ntottering. We ought to stop only when clear unity of type, independent\r\nof use and adaptation, ceases.\r\n\r\nBe it remembered no naturalist pretends to give test from external\r\ncharacters of species; in many genera the distinction is quite\r\narbitrary{177}. But there remains one other way of comparing species\r\nwith races; it is to compare the effects of crossing them. Would it not\r\nbe wonderful, if the union of two organisms, produced by two separate\r\nacts of Creation, blended their characters together when crossed\r\naccording to the same rules, as two races which have undoubtedly\r\ndescended from same parent stock; yet this can be shown to be the case.\r\nFor sterility, though a usual <?>, is not an invariable concomitant, it\r\nvaries much in degree and has been shown to be probably dependent on\r\ncauses closely analogous with those which make domesticated organisms\r\nsterile. Independent of sterility there is no difference between\r\nmongrels and hybrids, as can be shown in a long series of facts. It is\r\nstrikingly seen in cases of instincts, when the minds of the two species\r\nor races become blended together{178}. In both cases if the half-breed\r\nbe crossed with either parent for a few generations, all traces of the\r\none parent form is lost (as Kölreuter in two tobacco species almost\r\nsterile together), so that the Creationist in the case of a species,\r\nmust believe that one act of creation is absorbed into another!\r\n\r\n     {177} Between the lines occur the words:--\"Species vary according\r\n     to same general laws as varieties; they cross according to same\r\n     laws.\"\r\n\r\n     {178} \"A cross with a bull-dog has affected for many generations\r\n     the courage and obstinacy of greyhounds,\" _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 214,\r\n     vi. p. 327.\r\n\r\n{Illustration: Facsimile of the original manuscript of the paragraph on\r\np. 50.}\r\n\r\n\r\nCONCLUSION.\r\n\r\nSuch are my reasons for believing that specific forms are not immutable.\r\nThe affinity of different groups, the unity of types of structure, the\r\nrepresentative forms through which foetus passes, the metamorphosis of\r\norgans, the abortion of others cease to be metaphorical expressions and\r\nbecome intelligible facts. We no longer look <an> on animal as a savage does\r\nat a ship{179}, or other great work of art, as a thing wholly beyond\r\ncomprehension, but we feel far more interest in examining it. How\r\ninteresting is every instinct, when we speculate on their origin as an\r\nhereditary or congenital habit or produced by the selection of\r\nindividuals differing slightly from their parents. We must look at every\r\ncomplicated mechanism and instinct, as the summary of a long history,\r\n<as the summing up> of{180} useful contrivances, much like a work of art.\r\nHow interesting does the distribution of all animals become, as throwing\r\nlight on ancient geography. [We see some seas bridged over.] Geology\r\nloses in its glory from the imperfection of its archives{181}, but how\r\ndoes it gain in the immensity of the periods of its formations and of\r\nthe gaps separating these formations. There is much grandeur in looking\r\nat the existing animals either as the lineal descendants of the forms\r\nburied under thousand feet of matter, or as the coheirs of some still\r\nmore ancient ancestor. It accords with what we know of the law impressed\r\non matter by the Creator, that the creation and extinction of forms,\r\nlike the birth and death of individuals should be the effect of\r\nsecondary [laws] means{182}. It is derogatory that the Creator of\r\ncountless systems of worlds should have created each of the myriads of\r\ncreeping parasites and [slimy] worms which have swarmed each day of life\r\non land and water <on> [this] one globe. We cease being astonished, however\r\nmuch we may deplore, that a group of animals should have been directly\r\ncreated to lay their eggs in bowels and flesh of other,--that some\r\norganisms should delight in cruelty,--that animals should be led away by\r\nfalse instincts,--that annually there should be an incalculable waste\r\nof eggs and pollen. From death, famine, rapine, and the concealed war of\r\nnature we can see that the highest good, which we can conceive, the\r\ncreation of the higher animals has directly come. Doubtless it at first\r\ntranscends our humble powers, to conceive laws capable of creating\r\nindividual organisms, each characterised by the most exquisite\r\nworkmanship and widely-extended adaptations. It accords better with [our\r\nmodesty] the lowness of our faculties to suppose each must require the\r\nfiat of a creator, but in the same proportion the existence of such laws\r\nshould exalt our notion of the power of the omniscient Creator{183}.\r\nThere is a simple grandeur in the view of life with its powers of\r\ngrowth, assimilation and reproduction, being originally breathed into\r\nmatter under one or a few forms, and that whilst this our planet has\r\ngone circling on according to fixed laws, and land and water, in a cycle\r\nof change, have gone on replacing each other, that from so simple an\r\norigin, through the process of gradual selection of infinitesimal\r\nchanges, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful have been\r\nevolved{184}.\r\n\r\n     {179} The simile of the savage and the ship occurs in the _Origin_,\r\n     Ed. i. p. 485, vi. p. 665.\r\n\r\n     {180} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 486, vi. p. 665, the author speaks\r\n     of the \"summing up of many contrivances\": I have therefore\r\n     introduced the above words which make the passage clearer. In the\r\n     _Origin_ the comparison is with \"a great mechanical\r\n     invention,\"--not with a work of art.\r\n\r\n     {181} See a similar passage in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 487, vi. p.\r\n     667.\r\n\r\n     {182} See the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 488, vi. p. 668.\r\n\r\n     {183} The following discussion, together with some memoranda are on\r\n     the last page of the MS. \"The supposed creative spirit does not\r\n     create either number or kind which <are> from analogy adapted to site\r\n     (viz. New Zealand): it does not keep them all permanently adapted\r\n     to any country,--it works on spots or areas of creation,--it is not\r\n     persistent for great periods,--it creates forms of same groups in\r\n     same regions, with no physical similarity,--it creates, on islands\r\n     or mountain summits, species allied to the neighbouring ones, and\r\n     not allied to alpine nature as shown in other mountain\r\n     summits--even different on different island of similarly\r\n     constituted archipelago, not created on two points: never mammifers\r\n     created on small isolated island; nor number of organisms adapted\r\n     to locality: its power seems influenced or related to the range of\r\n     other species wholly distinct of the same genus,--it does not\r\n     equally effect, in amount of difference, all the groups of the same\r\n     class.\"\r\n\r\n     {184} This passage is the ancestor of the concluding words in the\r\n     first edition of the _Origin of Species_ which have remained\r\n     substantially unchanged throughout subsequent editions, \"There is\r\n     grandeur in this view of life, with its several powers, having been\r\n     originally breathed into a few forms or into one; and that whilst\r\n     this planet has gone cycling on according to the fixed law of\r\n     gravity, from so simple a beginning endless forms most beautiful\r\n     and most wonderful have been, and are being, evolved.\" In the 2nd\r\n     edition \"by the Creator\" is introduced after \"originally breathed.\"\r\n\r\nN.B.--There ought somewhere to be a discussion from Lyell to show that\r\nexternal conditions do vary, or a note to Lyell's works <work?>.\r\n\r\nBesides other difficulties in ii. Part, non-acclimatisation of plants.\r\nDifficulty when asked _how_ did white and negro become altered from\r\ncommon intermediate stock: no facts. We do NOT know that species are\r\nimmutable, on the contrary. What arguments against this theory, except\r\nour not perceiving every step, like the erosion of valleys{185}.\r\n\r\n     {185} Compare the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 481, vi. p. 659, \"The\r\n     difficulty is the same as that felt by so many geologists, when\r\n     Lyell first insisted that long lines of inland cliffs had been\r\n     formed, and great valleys excavated, by the slow action of the\r\n     coast-waves.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ESSAY OF 1844 PART I\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER I\r\n\r\nON THE VARIATION OF ORGANIC BEINGS UNDER DOMESTICATION; AND ON THE\r\nPRINCIPLES OF SELECTION\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most favourable conditions for variation seem to be when organic\r\nbeings are bred for many generations under domestication{186}: one may\r\ninfer this from the simple fact of the vast number of races and breeds\r\nof almost every plant and animal, which has long been domesticated.\r\nUnder certain conditions organic beings even during their individual\r\nlives become slightly altered from their usual form, size, or other\r\ncharacters: and many of the peculiarities thus acquired are transmitted\r\nto their offspring. Thus in animals, the size and vigour of body,\r\nfatness, period of maturity, habits of body or consensual movements,\r\nhabits of mind and temper, are modified or acquired during the life of\r\nthe individual{187}, and become inherited. There is reason to believe\r\nthat when long exercise has given to certain muscles great development,\r\nor disuse has lessened them, that such development is also inherited.\r\nFood and climate will occasionally produce changes in the colour and\r\ntexture of the external coverings of animals; and certain unknown\r\nconditions affect the horns of cattle in parts of Abyssinia; but whether\r\nthese peculiarities, thus acquired during individual lives, have been\r\ninherited, I do not know. It appears certain that malconformation and\r\nlameness in horses, produced by too much work on hard roads,--that\r\naffections of the eyes in this animal probably caused by bad\r\nventilation,--that tendencies towards many diseases in man, such as\r\ngout, caused by the course of life and ultimately producing changes of\r\nstructure, and that many other diseases produced by unknown agencies,\r\nsuch as goitre, and the idiotcy resulting from it, all become\r\nhereditary.\r\n\r\n     {186} The cumulative effect of domestication is insisted on in the\r\n     _Origin_, see _e.g. Origin_, Ed. i. p. 7, vi. p. 8.\r\n\r\n     {187} This type of variation passes into what he describes as the\r\n     direct effect of conditions. Since they are due to causes acting\r\n     during the adult life of the organism they might be called\r\n     individual variations, but he uses this term for congenital\r\n     variations, _e.g._ the differences discoverable in plants raised\r\n     from seeds of the same pod _(Origin_, Ed. i. p. 45, vi. p. 53).\r\n\r\nIt is very doubtful whether the flowers and leaf-buds, annually produced\r\nfrom the same bulb, root, or tree, can properly be considered as parts\r\nof the same individual, though in some respects they certainly seem to\r\nbe so. If they are parts of an individual, plants also are subject to\r\nconsiderable changes during their _individual_ lives. Most\r\nflorist-flowers if neglected degenerate, that is, they lose some of\r\ntheir characters; so common is this, that trueness is often stated, as\r\ngreatly enhancing the value of a variety{188}: tulips break their\r\ncolours only after some years' culture; some plants become double and\r\nothers single, by neglect or care: these characters can be transmitted\r\nby cuttings or grafts, and in some cases by true or seminal propagation.\r\nOccasionally a single bud on a plant assumes at once a new and widely\r\ndifferent character: thus it is certain that nectarines have been\r\nproduced on peach trees and moss roses on provence roses; white\r\ncurrants on red currant bushes; flowers of a different colour from that\r\nof the stock, in Chrysanthemums, Dahlias, sweet-williams, Azaleas, &c.,\r\n&c.; variegated leaf-buds on many trees, and other similar cases. These\r\nnew characters appearing in single buds, can, like those lesser changes\r\naffecting the whole plant, be multiplied not only by cuttings and such\r\nmeans, but often likewise by true seminal generation.\r\n\r\n     {188} <It is not clear where the following note is meant to come>:\r\n     Case of Orchis,--most remarkable as not long cultivated by\r\n     seminal propagation. Case of varieties which soon acquire, like\r\n     _Ægilops_ and Carrot (and Maize) _a certain general character_ and\r\n     then go on varying.\r\n\r\nThe changes thus appearing during the lives of individual animals and\r\nplants are extremely rare compared with those which are congenital or\r\nwhich appear soon after birth. Slight differences thus arising are\r\ninfinitely numerous: the proportions and form of every part of the\r\nframe, inside and outside, appear to vary in very slight degrees:\r\nanatomists dispute what is the \"beau ideal\" of the bones, the liver and\r\nkidneys, like painters do of the proportions of the face: the proverbial\r\nexpression that no two animals or plants are born absolutely alike, is\r\nmuch truer when applied to those under domestication, than to those in a\r\nstate of nature{189}. Besides these slight differences, single\r\nindividuals are occasionally born considerably unlike in certain parts\r\nor in their whole structure to their parents: these are called by\r\nhorticulturists and breeders \"sports\"; and are not uncommon except when\r\nvery strongly marked. Such sports are known in some cases to have been\r\nparents of some of our domestic races; and such probably have been the\r\nparents of many other races, especially of those which in some senses\r\nmay be called hereditary monsters; for instance where there is an\r\nadditional limb, or where all the limbs are stunted (as in the Ancon\r\nsheep), or where a part is wanting, as in rumpless fowls and tailless\r\ndogs or cats{190}. The effects of external conditions on the size,\r\ncolour and form, which can rarely and obscurely be detected during one\r\nindividual life, become apparent after several generations: the slight\r\ndifferences, often hardly describable, which characterize the stock of\r\ndifferent countries, and even of districts in the same country, seem to\r\nbe due to such continued action.\r\n\r\n     {189} Here, as in the MS. of 1842, the author is inclined to\r\n     minimise the variation occurring in nature.\r\n\r\n     {190} This is more strongly stated than in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p.\r\n     30.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the hereditary tendency._\r\n\r\nA volume might be filled with facts showing what a strong tendency there\r\nis to inheritance, in almost every case of the most trifling, as well as\r\nof the most remarkable congenital peculiarities{191}. The term\r\ncongenital peculiarity, I may remark, is a loose expression and can only\r\nmean a peculiarity apparent when the part affected is nearly or fully\r\ndeveloped: in the Second Part, I shall have to discuss at what period of\r\nthe embryonic life connatal peculiarities probably first appear; and I\r\nshall then be able to show from some evidence, that at whatever period\r\nof life a new peculiarity first appears, it tends hereditarily to appear\r\nat a corresponding period{192}. Numerous though slight changes, slowly\r\nsupervening in animals during mature life (often, though by no means\r\nalways, taking the form of disease), are, as stated in the first\r\nparagraphs, very often hereditary. In plants, again, the buds which\r\nassume a different character from their stock likewise tend to transmit\r\ntheir new peculiarities. There is not sufficient reason to believe that\r\neither mutilations{193} or changes of form produced by mechanical\r\npressure, even if continued for hundreds of generations, or that any\r\nchanges of structure quickly produced by disease, are inherited; it\r\nwould appear as if the tissue of the part affected must slowly and\r\nfreely grow into the new form, in order to be inheritable. There is a\r\nvery great difference in the hereditary tendency of different\r\npeculiarities, and of the same peculiarity, in different individuals and\r\nspecies; thus twenty thousand seeds of the weeping ash have been sown\r\nand not one come up true;--out of seventeen seeds of the weeping yew,\r\nnearly all came up true. The ill-formed and almost monstrous \"Niata\"\r\ncattle of S. America and Ancon sheep, both when bred together and when\r\ncrossed with other breeds, seem to transmit their peculiarities to their\r\noffspring as truly as the ordinary breeds. I can throw no light on these\r\ndifferences in the power of hereditary transmission. Breeders believe,\r\nand apparently with good cause, that a peculiarity generally becomes\r\nmore firmly implanted after having passed through several generations;\r\nthat is if one offspring out of twenty inherits a peculiarity from its\r\nparents, then its descendants will tend to transmit this peculiarity to\r\na larger proportion than one in twenty; and so on in succeeding\r\ngenerations. I have said nothing about mental peculiarities being\r\ninheritable for I reserve this subject for a separate chapter.\r\n\r\n     {191} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 13.\r\n\r\n     {192} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 86, vi. p. 105.\r\n\r\n     {193} It is interesting to find that though the author, like his\r\n     contemporaries, believed in the inheritance of acquired characters,\r\n     he excluded the case of mutilation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Causes of Variation._\r\n\r\nAttention must here be drawn to an important distinction in the first\r\norigin or appearance of varieties: when we see an animal highly kept\r\nproducing offspring with an hereditary tendency to early maturity and\r\nfatness; when we see the wild-duck and Australian dog always becoming,\r\nwhen bred for one or a few generations in confinement, mottled in their\r\ncolours; when we see people living in certain districts or circumstances\r\nbecoming subject to an hereditary taint to certain organic diseases, as\r\nconsumption or plica polonica,--we naturally attribute such changes to\r\nthe direct effect of known or unknown agencies acting for one or more\r\ngenerations on the parents. It is probable that a multitude of\r\npeculiarities may be thus directly caused by unknown external agencies.\r\nBut in breeds, characterized by an extra limb or claw, as in certain\r\nfowls and dogs; by an extra joint in the vertebræ; by the loss of a\r\npart, as the tail; by the substitution of a tuft of feathers for a comb\r\nin certain poultry; and in a multitude of other cases, we can hardly\r\nattribute these peculiarities directly to external influences, but\r\nindirectly to the laws of embryonic growth and of reproduction. When we\r\nsee a multitude of varieties (as has often been the case, where a cross\r\nhas been carefully guarded against) produced from seeds matured in the\r\nvery same capsule{194}, with the male and female principle nourished\r\nfrom the same roots and necessarily exposed to the same external\r\ninfluences; we cannot believe that the endless slight differences\r\nbetween seedling varieties thus produced, can be the effect of any\r\ncorresponding difference in their exposure. We are led (as Müller has\r\nremarked) to the same conclusion, when we see in the same litter,\r\nproduced by the same act of conception, animals considerably different.\r\n\r\n     {194} This corresponds to _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 10, vi. p. 9.\r\n\r\nAs variation to the degree here alluded to has been observed only in\r\norganic beings under domestication, and in plants amongst those most\r\nhighly and long cultivated, we must attribute, in such cases, the\r\nvarieties (although the difference between each variety cannot possibly\r\nbe attributed to any corresponding difference of exposure in the\r\nparents) to the indirect effects of domestication on the action of the\r\nreproductive system{195}. It would appear as if the reproductive powers\r\nfailed in their ordinary function of producing new organic beings\r\nclosely like their parents; and as if the entire organization of the\r\nembryo, under domestication, became in a slight degree plastic{196}. We\r\nshall hereafter have occasion to show, that in organic beings, a\r\nconsiderable change from the natural conditions of life, affects,\r\nindependently of their general state of health, in another and\r\nremarkable manner the reproductive system. I may add, judging from the\r\nvast number of new varieties of plants which have been produced in the\r\nsame districts and under nearly the same routine of culture, that\r\nprobably the indirect effects of domestication in making the\r\norganization plastic, is a much more efficient source of variation than\r\nany direct effect which external causes may have on the colour, texture,\r\nor form of each part. In the few instances in which, as in the\r\nDahlia{197}, the course of variation has been recorded, it appears that\r\ndomestication produces little effect for several generations in\r\nrendering the organization plastic; but afterwards, as if by an\r\naccumulated effect, the original character of the species suddenly gives\r\nway or breaks.\r\n\r\n     {195} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 8, vi. p. 10.\r\n\r\n     {196} For _plasticity_ see _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 12, 132.\r\n\r\n     {197} _Var. under Dom._, Ed. ii. I. p. 393.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On Selection._\r\n\r\nWe have hitherto only referred to the first appearance in individuals of\r\nnew peculiarities; but to make a race or breed, something more is\r\ngenerally{198} requisite than such peculiarities (except in the case of\r\nthe peculiarities being the direct effect of constantly surrounding\r\nconditions) should be inheritable,--namely the principle of selection,\r\nimplying separation. Even in the rare instances of sports, with the\r\nhereditary tendency very strongly implanted, crossing must be prevented\r\nwith other breeds, or if not prevented the best characterized of the\r\nhalf-bred offspring must be carefully selected. Where the external\r\nconditions are constantly tending to give some character, a race\r\npossessing this character will be formed with far greater ease by\r\nselecting and breeding together the individuals most affected. In the\r\ncase of the endless slight variations produced by the indirect effects\r\nof domestication on the action of the reproductive system, selection is\r\nindispensable to form races; and when carefully applied, wonderfully\r\nnumerous and diverse races can be formed. Selection, though so simple in\r\ntheory, is and has been important to a degree which can hardly be\r\noverrated. It requires extreme skill, the results of long practice, in\r\ndetecting the slightest difference in the forms of animals, and it\r\nimplies some distinct object in view; with these requisites and\r\npatience, the breeder has simply to watch for every the smallest\r\napproach to the desired end, to select such individuals and pair them\r\nwith the most suitable forms, and so continue with succeeding\r\ngenerations. In most cases careful selection and the prevention of\r\naccidental crosses will be necessary for several generations, for in new\r\nbreeds there is a strong tendency to vary and especially to revert to\r\nancestral forms: but in every succeeding generation less care will be\r\nrequisite for the breed will become truer; until ultimately only an\r\noccasional individual will require to be separated or destroyed.\r\nHorticulturalists in raising seeds regularly practise this, and call it\r\n\"roguing,\" or destroying the \"rogues\" or false varieties. There is\r\nanother and less efficient means of selection amongst animals: namely\r\nrepeatedly procuring males with some desirable qualities, and allowing\r\nthem and their offspring to breed freely together; and this in the\r\ncourse of time will affect the whole lot. These principles of selection\r\nhave been _methodically_ followed for scarcely a century; but their\r\nhigh importance is shown by the practical results, and is admitted\r\nin the writings of the most celebrated agriculturalists and\r\nhorticulturalists;--I need only name Anderson, Marshall, Bakewell, Coke,\r\nWestern, Sebright and Knight.\r\n\r\n     {198} Selection is here used in the sense of isolation, rather than\r\n     as implying the summation of small differences. Professor Henslow\r\n     in his _Heredity of Acquired Characters in Plants_, 1908, p. 2,\r\n     quotes from Darwin's _Var. under Dom._, Ed. i. II. p. 271, a\r\n     passage in which the author, speaking of the direct action of\r\n     conditions, says:--\"A new sub-variety would thus be produced\r\n     without the aid of selection.\" Darwin certainly did not mean to\r\n     imply that such varieties are freed from the action of natural\r\n     selection, but merely that a new form may appear without\r\n     _summation_ of new characters. Professor Henslow is apparently\r\n     unaware that the above passage is omitted in the second edition of\r\n     _Var. under Dom._, II. p. 260.\r\n\r\nEven in well-established breeds the individuals of which to an\r\nunpractised eye would appear absolutely similar, which would give, it\r\nmight have been thought, no scope to selection, the whole appearance of\r\nthe animal has been changed in a few years (as in the case of Lord\r\nWestern's sheep), so that practised agriculturalists could scarcely\r\ncredit that a change had not been effected by a cross with other breeds.\r\nBreeders both of plants and animals frequently give their means of\r\nselection greater scope, by crossing different breeds and selecting the\r\noffspring; but we shall have to recur to this subject again.\r\n\r\nThe external conditions will doubtless influence and modify the results\r\nof the most careful selection; it has been found impossible to prevent\r\ncertain breeds of cattle from degenerating on mountain pastures; it\r\nwould probably be impossible to keep the plumage of the wild-duck in the\r\ndomesticated race; in certain soils, no care has been sufficient to\r\nraise cauliflower seed true to its character; and so in many other\r\ncases. But with patience it is wonderful what man has effected. He has\r\nselected and therefore in one sense made one breed of horses to race and\r\nanother to pull; he has made sheep with fleeces good for carpets and\r\nother sheep good for broadcloth; he has, in the same sense, made one dog\r\nto find game and give him notice when found, and another dog to fetch\r\nhim the game when killed; he has made by selection the fat to lie mixed\r\nwith the meat in one breed and in another to accumulate in the bowels\r\nfor the tallow-chandler{199}; he has made the legs of one breed of\r\npigeons long, and the beak of another so short, that it can hardly feed\r\nitself; he has previously determined how the feathers on a bird's body\r\nshall be coloured, and how the petals of many flowers shall be streaked\r\nor fringed, and has given prizes for complete success;--by selection, he\r\nhas made the leaves of one variety and the flower-buds of another\r\nvariety of the cabbage good to eat, at different seasons of the year;\r\nand thus has he acted on endless varieties. I do not wish to affirm that\r\nthe long-and short-wooled sheep, or that the pointer and retriever, or\r\nthat the cabbage and cauliflower have certainly descended from one and\r\nthe same aboriginal wild stock; if they have not so descended, though it\r\nlessens what man has effected, a large result must be left unquestioned.\r\n\r\n     {199} See the Essay of 1842, p. 3.\r\n\r\nIn saying as I have done that man makes a breed, let it not be\r\nconfounded with saying that man makes the individuals, which are given\r\nby nature with certain desirable qualities; man only adds together and\r\nmakes a permanent gift of nature's bounties. In several cases, indeed,\r\nfor instance in the \"Ancon\" sheep, valuable from not getting over\r\nfences, and in the turnspit dog, man has probably only prevented\r\ncrossing; but in many cases we positively know that he has gone on\r\nselecting, and taking advantage of successive small variations.\r\n\r\nSelection{200} has been _methodically_ followed, as I have said, for\r\nbarely a century; but it cannot be doubted that occasionally it has been\r\npractised from the remotest ages, in those animals completely under the\r\ndominion of man. In the earliest chapters of the Bible there are rules\r\ngiven for influencing the colours of breeds, and black and white sheep\r\nare spoken of as separated. In the time of Pliny the barbarians of\r\nEurope and Asia endeavoured by cross-breeding with a wild stock to\r\nimprove the races of their dogs and horses. The savages of Guyana now do\r\nso with their dogs: such care shows at least that the characters of\r\nindividual animals were attended to. In the rudest times of English\r\nhistory, there were laws to prevent the exportation of fine animals of\r\nestablished breeds, and in the case of horses, in Henry VIII's time,\r\nlaws for the destruction of all horses under a certain size. In one of\r\nthe oldest numbers of the _Phil. Transactions_, there are rules for\r\nselecting and improving the breeds of sheep. Sir H. Bunbury, in 1660,\r\nhas given rules for selecting the finest seedling plants, with as much\r\nprecision as the best recent horticulturalist could. Even in the most\r\nsavage and rude nations, in the wars and famines which so frequently\r\noccur, the most useful of their animals would be preserved: the value\r\nset upon animals by savages is shown by the inhabitants of Tierra del\r\nFuego devouring their old women before their dogs, which as they\r\nasserted are useful in otter-hunting{201}: who can doubt but that in\r\nevery case of famine and war, the best otter-hunters would be preserved,\r\nand therefore in fact selected for breeding. As the offspring so\r\nobviously take after their parents, and as we have seen that savages\r\ntake pains in crossing their dogs and horses with wild stocks, we may\r\neven conclude as probable that they would sometimes pair the most useful\r\nof their animals and keep their offspring separate. As different races\r\nof men require and admire different qualities in their domesticated\r\nanimals, each would thus slowly, though unconsciously, be selecting a\r\ndifferent breed. As Pallas has remarked, who can doubt but that the\r\nancient Russian would esteem and endeavour to preserve those sheep in\r\nhis flocks which had the thickest coats. This kind of insensible\r\nselection by which new breeds are not selected and kept separate, but a\r\npeculiar character is slowly given to the whole mass of the breed, by\r\noften saving the life of animals with certain characteristics, we may\r\nfeel nearly sure, from what we see has been done by the more direct\r\nmethod of separate selection within the last 50 years in England, would\r\nin the course of some thousand years produce a marked effect.\r\n\r\n     {200} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 33, vi. p. 38. The evidence is given\r\n     in the present Essay rather more fully than in the _Origin_.\r\n\r\n     {201} _Journal of Researches_, Ed. 1860, p. 214. \"Doggies catch\r\n     otters, old women no.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n_Crossing Breeds._\r\n\r\nWhen once two or more races are formed, or if more than one race, or\r\nspecies fertile _inter se_, originally existed in a wild state, their\r\ncrossing becomes a most copious source of new races{202}. When two\r\nwell-marked races are crossed the offspring in the first generation take\r\nmore or less after either parent or are quite intermediate between them,\r\nor rarely assume characters in some degree new. In the second and\r\nseveral succeeding generations, the offspring are generally found to\r\nvary exceedingly, one compared with another, and many revert nearly to\r\ntheir ancestral forms. This greater variability in succeeding\r\ngenerations seems analogous to the breaking or variability of organic\r\nbeings after having been bred for some generations under\r\ndomestication{203}. So marked is this variability in cross-bred\r\ndescendants, that Pallas and some other naturalists have supposed that\r\nall variation is due to an original cross; but I conceive that the\r\nhistory of the potato, Dahlia, Scotch Rose, the guinea-pig, and of many\r\ntrees in this country, where only one species of the genus exists,\r\nclearly shows that a species may vary where there can have been no\r\ncrossing. Owing to this variability and tendency to reversion in\r\ncross-bred beings, much careful selection is requisite to make\r\nintermediate or new permanent races: nevertheless crossing has been a\r\nmost powerful engine, especially with plants, where means of propagation\r\nexist by which the cross-bred varieties can be secured without incurring\r\nthe risk of fresh variation from seminal propagation: with animals the\r\nmost skilful agriculturalists now greatly prefer careful selection from\r\na well-established breed, rather than from uncertain cross-bred stocks.\r\n\r\n     {202} The effects of crossing is much more strongly stated here\r\n     than in the _Origin_. See Ed. i. p. 20, vi. p. 23, where indeed the\r\n     opposite point of view is given. His change of opinion may be due\r\n     to his work on pigeons. The whole of the discussion on crossing\r\n     corresponds to Chapter VIII of the _Origin_, Ed. i. rather than to\r\n     anything in the earlier part of the book.\r\n\r\n     {203} The parallelism between the effects of a cross and the\r\n     effects of conditions is given from a different point of view in\r\n     the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 266, vi. p. 391. See the experimental\r\n     evidence for this important principle in the author's work on\r\n     _Cross and Self-Fertilisation_. Professor Bateson has suggested\r\n     that the experiments should be repeated with gametically pure\r\n     plants.\r\n\r\nAlthough intermediate and new races may be formed by the mingling of\r\nothers, yet if the two races are allowed to mingle quite freely, so that\r\nnone of either parent race remain pure, then, especially if the parent\r\nraces are not widely different, they will slowly blend together, and the\r\ntwo races will be destroyed, and one mongrel race left in its place.\r\nThis will of course happen in a shorter time, if one of the parent\r\nraces exists in greater number than the other. We see the effect of this\r\nmingling, in the manner in which the aboriginal breeds of dogs and pigs\r\nin the Oceanic Islands and the many breeds of our domestic animals\r\nintroduced into S. America, have all been lost and absorbed in a mongrel\r\nrace. It is probably owing to the freedom of crossing, that, in\r\nuncivilised countries, where inclosures do not exist, we seldom meet\r\nwith more than one race of a species: it is only in enclosed countries,\r\nwhere the inhabitants do not migrate, and have conveniences for\r\nseparating the several kinds of domestic animals, that we meet with a\r\nmultitude of races. Even in civilised countries, want of care for a few\r\nyears has been found to destroy the good results of far longer periods\r\nof selection and separation.\r\n\r\nThis power of crossing will affect the races of all _terrestrial_\r\nanimals; for all terrestrial animals require for their reproduction the\r\nunion of two individuals. Amongst plants, races will not cross and blend\r\ntogether with so much freedom as in terrestrial animals; but this\r\ncrossing takes place through various curious contrivances to a\r\nsurprising extent. In fact such contrivances exist in so very many\r\nhermaphrodite flowers by which an occasional cross may take place, that\r\nI cannot avoid suspecting (with Mr Knight) that the reproductive action\r\nrequires, at _intervals_, the concurrence of distinct individuals{204}.\r\nMost breeders of plants and animals are firmly convinced that benefit is\r\nderived from an occasional cross, not with another race, but with\r\nanother family of the same race; and that, on the other hand, injurious\r\nconsequences follow from long-continued close interbreeding in the same\r\nfamily. Of marine animals, many more, than was till lately believed,\r\nhave their sexes on separate individuals; and where they are\r\nhermaphrodite, there seems very generally to be means through the water\r\nof one individual occasionally impregnating another: if individual\r\nanimals can singly propagate themselves for perpetuity, it is\r\nunaccountable that no terrestrial animal, where the means of observation\r\nare more obvious, should be in this predicament of singly perpetuating\r\nits kind. I conclude, then, that races of most animals and plants, when\r\nunconfined in the same country, would tend to blend together.\r\n\r\n     {204} The so-called Knight-Darwin Law is often misunderstood. See\r\n     Goebel in _Darwin and Modern Science_, 1909, p. 419; also F.\r\n     Darwin, _Nature_, Oct. 27, 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Whether our domestic races have descended from one or more wild\r\nstocks._\r\n\r\nSeveral naturalists, of whom Pallas{205} regarding animals, and Humboldt\r\nregarding certain plants, were the first, believe that the breeds of\r\nmany of our domestic animals such as of the horse, pig, dog, sheep,\r\npigeon, and poultry, and of our plants have descended from more than one\r\naboriginal form. They leave it doubtful, whether such forms are to be\r\nconsidered wild races, or true species, whose offspring are fertile when\r\ncrossed _inter se_. The main arguments for this view consist, firstly,\r\nof the great difference between such breeds, as the Race-and Cart-Horse,\r\nor the Greyhound and Bull-dog, and of our ignorance of the steps or\r\nstages through which these could have passed from a common parent; and\r\nsecondly that in the most ancient historical periods, breeds resembling\r\nsome of those at present most different, existed in different countries.\r\nThe wolves of N. America and of Siberia are thought to be different\r\nspecies; and it has been remarked that the dogs belonging to the\r\nsavages in these two countries resemble the wolves of the same country;\r\nand therefore that they have probably descended from two different wild\r\nstocks. In the same manner, these naturalists believe that the horse of\r\nArabia and of Europe have probably descended from two wild stocks both\r\napparently now extinct. I do not think the assumed fertility of these\r\nwild stocks any very great difficulty on this view; for although in\r\nanimals the offspring of most cross-bred species are infertile, it is\r\nnot always remembered that the experiment is very seldom fairly tried,\r\nexcept when two near species _both_ breed freely (which does not readily\r\nhappen, as we shall hereafter see) when under the dominion of man.\r\nMoreover in the case of the China{206} and common goose, the canary and\r\nsiskin, the hybrids breed freely; in other cases the offspring from\r\nhybrids crossed with either pure parent are fertile, as is practically\r\ntaken advantage of with the yak and cow; as far as the analogy of plants\r\nserves, it is impossible to deny that some species are quite fertile\r\n_inter se_; but to this subject we shall recur.\r\n\r\n     {205} Pallas' theory is discussed in the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 253,\r\n     254, vi. p. 374.\r\n\r\n     {206} See Darwin's paper on the fertility of hybrids from the\r\n     common and Chinese goose in _Nature_, Jan. 1, 1880.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the upholders of the view that the several breeds of\r\ndogs, horses, &c., &c., have descended each from one stock, may aver\r\nthat their view removes all _difficulty about fertility_, and that the\r\nmain argument from the high antiquity of different breeds, somewhat\r\nsimilar to the present breeds, is worth little without knowing the date\r\nof the domestication of such animals, which is far from being the case.\r\nThey may also with more weight aver that, knowing that organic beings\r\nunder domestication do vary in some degree, the argument from the great\r\ndifference between certain breeds is worth nothing, without we know the\r\nlimits of variation during a long course of time, which is far from the\r\ncase. They may argue that almost every county in England, and in many\r\ndistricts of other countries, for instance in India, there are slightly\r\ndifferent breeds of the domestic animals; and that it is opposed to all\r\nthat we know of the distribution of wild animals to suppose that these\r\nhave descended from so many different wild races or species: if so, they\r\nmay argue, is it not probable that countries quite separate and exposed\r\nto different climates would have breeds not slightly, but considerably,\r\ndifferent? Taking the most favourable case, on both sides, namely that\r\nof the dog; they might urge that such breeds as the bull-dog and\r\nturnspit have been reared by man, from the ascertained fact that\r\nstrictly analogous breeds (namely the Niata ox and Ancon sheep) in other\r\nquadrupeds have thus originated. Again they may say, seeing what\r\ntraining and careful selection has effected for the greyhound, and\r\nseeing how absolutely unfit the Italian greyhound is to maintain itself\r\nin a state of nature, is it not probable that at least all\r\ngreyhounds,--from the rough deerhound, the smooth Persian, the common\r\nEnglish, to the Italian,--have descended from one stock{207}? If so, is\r\nit so improbable that the deerhound and long-legged shepherd dog have so\r\ndescended? If we admit this, and give up the bull-dog, we can hardly\r\ndispute the probable common descent of the other breeds.\r\n\r\n     {207} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 19, vi. p. 22.\r\n\r\nThe evidence is so conjectural and balanced on both sides that at\r\npresent I conceive that no one can decide: for my own part, I lean to\r\nthe probability of most of our domestic animals having descended from\r\nmore than one wild stock; though from the arguments last advanced and\r\nfrom reflecting on the slow though inevitable effect of different races\r\nof mankind, under different circumstances, saving the lives of and\r\ntherefore selecting the individuals most useful to them, I cannot doubt\r\nbut that one class of naturalists have much overrated the probable\r\nnumber of the aboriginal wild stocks. As far as we admit the difference\r\nof our races <to be> due to the differences of their original stocks, so\r\nmuch must we give up of the amount of variation produced under\r\ndomestication. But this appears to me unimportant, for we certainly know\r\nin some few cases, for instance in the Dahlia, and potato, and rabbit,\r\nthat a great number of varieties have proceeded from one stock; and, in\r\nmany of our domestic races, we know that man, by slowly selecting and by\r\ntaking advantage of sudden sports, has considerably modified old races\r\nand produced new ones. Whether we consider our races as the descendants\r\nof one or several wild stocks, we are in far the greater number of cases\r\nequally ignorant what these stocks were.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limits to Variation in degree and kind._\r\n\r\nMan's power in making races deends, in the first instance, on the stock\r\non which he works being variable; but his labours are modified and\r\nlimited, as we have seen, by the direct effects of the external\r\nconditions,--by the deficient or imperfect hereditariness of new\r\npeculiarities,--and by the tendency to continual variation and\r\nespecially to reversion to ancestral forms. If the stock is not variable\r\nunder domestication, of course he can do nothing; and it appears that\r\nspecies differ considerably in this tendency to variation, in the same\r\nway as even sub-varieties from the same variety differ greatly in this\r\nrespect, and transmit to their offspring this difference in tendency.\r\nWhether the absence of a tendency to vary is an unalterable quality in\r\ncertain species, or depends on some deficient condition of the\r\nparticular state of domestication to which they are exposed, there is no\r\nevidence. When the organization is rendered variable, or plastic, as I\r\nhave expressed it, under domestication, different parts of the frame\r\nvary more or less in different species: thus in the breeds of cattle it\r\nhas been remarked that the horns are the most constant or least variable\r\ncharacter, for these often remain constant, whilst the colour, size,\r\nproportions of the body, tendency to fatten &c., vary; in sheep, I\r\nbelieve, the horns are much more variable. As a general rule the less\r\nimportant parts of the organization seem to vary most, but I think there\r\nis sufficient evidence that every part occasionally varies in a slight\r\ndegree. Even when man has the primary requisite variability he is\r\nnecessarily checked by the health and life of the stock he is working\r\non: thus he has already made pigeons with such small beaks that they can\r\nhardly eat and will not rear their own young; he has made families of\r\nsheep with so strong a tendency to early maturity and to fatten, that in\r\ncertain pastures they cannot live from their extreme liability to\r\ninflammation; he has made (_i.e._ selected) sub-varieties of plants with\r\na tendency to such early growth that they are frequently killed by the\r\nspring frosts; he has made a breed of cows having calves with such large\r\nhinder quarters that they are born with great difficulty, often to the\r\ndeath of their mothers{208}; the breeders were compelled to remedy this\r\nby the selection of a breeding stock with smaller hinder quarters; in\r\nsuch a case, however, it is possible by long patience and great loss, a\r\nremedy might have been found in selecting cows capable of giving birth\r\nto calves with large hinder quarters, for in human kind there <are> no\r\ndoubt hereditary bad and good confinements. Besides the limits already\r\nspecified, there can be little doubt that the variation of different\r\nparts of the frame are connected together by many laws{209}: thus the\r\ntwo sides of the body, in health and disease, seem almost always to vary\r\ntogether: it has been asserted by breeders that if the head is much\r\nelongated, the bones of the extremities will likewise be so; in\r\nseedling-apples large leaves and fruit generally go together, and serve\r\nthe horticulturalist as some guide in his selection; we can here see the\r\nreason, as the fruit is only a metamorphosed leaf. In animals the teeth\r\nand hair seem connected, for the hairless Chinese dog is almost\r\ntoothless. Breeders believe that one part of the frame or function being\r\nincreased causes other parts to decrease: they dislike great horns and\r\ngreat bones as so much flesh lost; in hornless breeds of cattle certain\r\nbones of the head become more developed: it is said that fat\r\naccumulating in one part checks its accumulation in another, and\r\nlikewise checks the action of the udder. The whole organization is so\r\nconnected that it is probable there are many conditions determining the\r\nvariation of each part, and causing other parts to vary with it; and man\r\nin making new races must be limited and ruled by all such laws.\r\n\r\n     {208} _Var. under Dom._, Ed. ii. vol. II. p. 211.\r\n\r\n     {209} This discussion corresponds to the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 11\r\n     and 143, vi. pp. 13 and 177.\r\n\r\n\r\n_In what consists Domestication._\r\n\r\nIn this chapter we have treated of variation under domestication, and it\r\nnow remains to consider in what does this power of domestication\r\nconsist{210}, a subject of considerable difficulty. Observing that\r\norganic beings of almost every class, in all climates, countries, and\r\ntimes, have varied when long bred under domestication, we must conclude\r\nthat the influence is of some very general nature{211}. Mr Knight alone,\r\nas far as I know, has tried to define it; he believes it consists of an\r\nexcess of food, together with transport to a more genial climate, or\r\nprotection from its severities. I think we cannot admit this latter\r\nproposition, for we know how many vegetable products, aborigines of this\r\ncountry, here vary, when cultivated without any protection from the\r\nweather; and some of our variable trees, as apricots, peaches, have\r\nundoubtedly been derived from a more genial climate. There appears to be\r\nmuch more truth in the doctrine of excess of food being the cause,\r\nthough I much doubt whether this is the sole cause, although it may well\r\nbe requisite for the kind of variation desired by man, namely increase\r\nof size and vigour. No doubt horticulturalists, when they wish to raise\r\nnew seedlings, often pluck off all the flower-buds, except a few, or\r\nremove the whole during one season, so that a great stock of nutriment\r\nmay be thrown into the flowers which are to seed. When plants are\r\ntransported from high-lands, forests, marshes, heaths, into our gardens\r\nand greenhouses, there must be a considerable change of food, but it\r\nwould be hard to prove that there was in every case an excess of the\r\nkind proper to the plant. If it be an excess of food, compared with that\r\nwhich the being obtained in its natural state{212}, the effects continue\r\nfor an improbably long time; during how many ages has wheat been\r\ncultivated, and cattle and sheep reclaimed, and we cannot suppose their\r\n_amount_ of food has gone on increasing, nevertheless these are amongst\r\nthe most variable of our domestic productions. It has been remarked\r\n(Marshall) that some of the most highly kept breeds of sheep and cattle\r\nare truer or less variable than the straggling animals of the poor,\r\nwhich subsist on commons, and pick up a bare subsistence{213}. In the\r\ncase of forest-trees raised in nurseries, which vary more than the same\r\ntrees do in their aboriginal forests, the cause would seem simply to lie\r\nin their not having to struggle against other trees and weeds, which in\r\ntheir natural state doubtless would limit the conditions of their\r\nexistence. It appears to me that the power of domestication resolves\r\nitself into the accumulated effects of a change of all or some of the\r\nnatural conditions of the life of the species, often associated with\r\nexcess of food. These conditions moreover, I may add, can seldom remain,\r\nowing to the mutability of the affairs, habits, migrations, and\r\nknowledge of man, for very long periods the same. I am the more inclined\r\nto come to this conclusion from finding, as we shall hereafter show,\r\nthat changes of the natural conditions of existence seem peculiarly to\r\naffect the action of the reproductive system{214}. As we see that\r\nhybrids and mongrels, after the first generation, are apt to vary much,\r\nwe may at least conclude that variability does not altogether depend on\r\nexcess of food.\r\n\r\n     {210} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 7, vi. p. 7.\r\n\r\n     {211} <Note in the original.> \"Isidore G.

What the\r\n     meaning of \"not of the offspring\" may be is not clear.\r\n\r\n     {213} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 41, vi. p. 46 the question is\r\n     differently treated; it is pointed out that a large stock of\r\n     individuals gives a better chance of available variations\r\n     occurring. Darwin quotes from Marshall that sheep in small lots can\r\n     never be improved. This comes from Marshall's _Review of the\r\n     Reports to the Board of Agriculture_, 1808, p. 406. In this Essay\r\n     the name Marshall occurs in the margin. Probably this refers to\r\n     _loc. cit._ p. 200, where unshepherded sheep in many parts of\r\n     England are said to be similar owing to mixed breeding not being\r\n     avoided.\r\n\r\n     {214} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 8, vi. p. 8.\r\n\r\nAfter these views, it may be asked how it comes that certain animals\r\nand plants, which have been domesticated for a considerable length of\r\ntime, and transported from very different conditions of existence, have\r\nnot varied much, or scarcely at all; for instance, the ass, peacock,\r\nguinea-fowl, asparagus, Jerusalem artichoke{215}. I have already said\r\nthat probably different species, like different sub-varieties, possess\r\ndifferent degrees of tendency to vary; but I am inclined to attribute in\r\nthese cases the want of numerous races less to want of variability than\r\nto selection not having been practised on them. No one will take the\r\npains to select without some corresponding object, either of use or\r\namusement; the individuals raised must be tolerably numerous, and not so\r\nprecious, but that he may freely destroy those not answering to his\r\nwishes. If guinea-fowls or peacocks{216} became \"fancy\" birds, I cannot\r\ndoubt that after some generations several breeds would be raised. Asses\r\nhave not been worked on from mere neglect; but they differ in _some_\r\ndegree in different countries. The insensible selection, due to\r\ndifferent races of mankind preserving those individuals most useful to\r\nthem in their different circumstances, will apply only to the oldest and\r\nmost widely domesticated animals. In the case of plants, we must put\r\nentirely out of the case those exclusively (or almost so) propagated by\r\ncuttings, layers or tubers, such as the Jerusalem artichoke and laurel;\r\nand if we put on one side plants of little ornament or use, and those\r\nwhich are used at so early a period of their growth that no especial\r\ncharacters signify, as asparagus{217} and seakale, I can think of none\r\nlong cultivated which have not varied. In no case ought we to expect to\r\nfind as much variation in a race when it alone has been formed, as when\r\nseveral have been formed, for their crossing and recrossing will\r\ngreatly increase their variability.\r\n\r\n     {215} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 42, vi. p. 48.\r\n\r\n     {216} <Note in the original.> There are white peacocks.\r\n\r\n     {217} <Note in the original.> There are varieties of asparagus.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of first Chapter._\r\n\r\nTo sum up this chapter. Races are made under domestication: 1st, by the\r\ndirect effects of the external conditions to which the species is\r\nexposed: 2nd, by the indirect effects of the exposure to new conditions,\r\noften aided by excess of food, rendering the organization plastic, and\r\nby man's selecting and separately breeding certain individuals, or\r\nintroducing to his stock selected males, or often preserving with care\r\nthe life of the individuals best adapted to his purposes: 3rd, by\r\ncrossing and recrossing races already made, and selecting their\r\noffspring. After some generations man may relax his care in selection:\r\nfor the tendency to vary and to revert to ancestral forms will decrease,\r\nso that he will have only occasionally to remove or destroy one of the\r\nyearly offspring which departs from its type. Ultimately, with a large\r\nstock, the effects of free crossing would keep, even without this care,\r\nhis breed true. By these means man can produce infinitely numerous\r\nraces, curiously adapted to ends, both most important and most\r\nfrivolous; at the same time that the effects of the surrounding\r\nconditions, the laws of inheritance, of growth, and of variation, will\r\nmodify and limit his labours.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II\r\n\r\nON THE VARIATION OF ORGANIC BEINGS IN A WILD STATE; ON THE NATURAL MEANS\r\nOF SELECTION; AND ON THE COMPARISON OF DOMESTIC RACES AND TRUE SPECIES\r\n\r\n\r\nHaving treated of variation under domestication, we now come to it in a\r\n_state of nature_.\r\n\r\nMost organic beings in a state of nature vary exceedingly little{218}: I\r\nput out of the case variations (as stunted plants &c., and sea-shells in\r\nbrackish water{219}) which are directly the effect of external agencies\r\nand which we do not _know are in the breed_{220}, or are _hereditary_.\r\nThe amount of hereditary variation is very difficult to ascertain,\r\nbecause naturalists (partly from the want of knowledge, and partly from\r\nthe inherent difficulty of the subject) do not all agree whether certain\r\nforms are species or races{221}. Some strongly marked races of plants,\r\ncomparable with the decided sports of horticulturalists, undoubtedly\r\nexist in a state of nature, as is actually known by experiment, for\r\ninstance in the primrose and cowslip{222}, in two so-called species of\r\ndandelion, in two of foxglove{223}, and I believe in some pines. Lamarck\r\nhas observed that, as long as we confine our attention to one limited\r\ncountry, there is seldom much difficulty in deciding what forms to call\r\nspecies and what varieties; and that it is when collections flow in from\r\nall parts of the world that naturalists often feel at a loss to decide\r\nthe limit of variation. Undoubtedly so it is, yet amongst British plants\r\n(and I may add land shells), which are probably better known than any in\r\nthe world, the best naturalists differ very greatly in the relative\r\nproportions of what they call species and what varieties. In many genera\r\nof insects, and shells, and plants, it seems almost hopeless to\r\nestablish which are which. In the higher classes there are less doubts;\r\nthough we find considerable difficulty in ascertaining what deserve to\r\nbe called species amongst foxes and wolves, and in some birds, for\r\ninstance in the case of the white barn-owl. When specimens are brought\r\nfrom different parts of the world, how often do naturalists dispute this\r\nsame question, as I found with respect to the birds brought from the\r\nGalapagos islands. Yarrell has remarked that the individuals of the same\r\nundoubted species of birds, from Europe and N. America, usually present\r\nslight, indefinable though perceptible differences. The recognition\r\nindeed of one animal by another of its kind seems to imply some\r\ndifference. The disposition of wild animals undoubtedly differs. The\r\nvariation, such as it is, chiefly affects the same parts in wild\r\norganisms as in domestic breeds; for instance, the size, colour, and the\r\nexternal and less important parts. In many species the variability of\r\ncertain organs or qualities is even stated as one of the specific\r\ncharacters: thus, in plants, colour, size, hairiness, the number of the\r\nstamens and pistils, and even their presence, the form of the leaves;\r\nthe size and form of the mandibles of the males of some insects; the\r\nlength and curvature of the beak in some birds (as in Opetiorynchus) are\r\nvariable characters in some species and quite fixed in others. I do not\r\nperceive that any just distinction can be drawn between this recognised\r\nvariability of certain parts in many species and the more general\r\nvariability of the whole frame in domestic races.\r\n\r\n     {218} In Chapter II of the first edition of the _Origin_ Darwin\r\n     insists rather on the presence of variability in a state of nature;\r\n     see, for instance, p. 45, Ed. vi. p. 53, \"I am convinced that the\r\n     most experienced naturalist would be surprised at the number of the\r\n     cases of variability ... which he could collect on good authority,\r\n     as I have collected, during a course of years.\"\r\n\r\n     {219} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 44, vi. p. 52.\r\n\r\n     {220} <Note in the original.> Here discuss _what is a species_,\r\n     sterility can most rarely be told when crossed.--Descent from common\r\n     stock.\r\n\r\n     {221} <Note in the original.> Give only rule: chain of intermediate\r\n     forms, and _analogy_; this important. Every Naturalist at first when\r\n     he gets hold of new variable type is _quite puzzled_ to know what to\r\n     think species and what variations.\r\n\r\n     {222} The author had not at this time the knowledge of the meaning\r\n     of dimorphism.\r\n\r\n     {223} <Note in original.> Compare feathered heads in very different\r\n     birds with spines in Echidna and Hedgehog. <In _Variation under\r\n     Domestication_, Ed. ii. vol. II. p. 317, Darwin calls attention to\r\n     laced and frizzled breeds occurring in both fowls and pigeons. In\r\n     the same way a peculiar form of covering occurs in Echidna and the\r\n     hedgehog.>\r\n\r\n     Plants under very different climate not varying. Digitalis shows\r\n     jumps <?> in variation, like Laburnum and Orchis case--in fact hostile\r\n     cases. Variability of sexual characters alike in domestic and wild.\r\n\r\nAlthough the amount of variation be exceedingly small in most organic\r\nbeings in a state of nature, and probably quite wanting (as far as our\r\nsenses serve) in the majority of cases; yet considering how many animals\r\nand plants, taken by mankind from different quarters of the world for\r\nthe most diverse purposes, have varied under domestication in every\r\ncountry and in every age, I think we may safely conclude that all\r\norganic beings with few exceptions, if capable of being domesticated and\r\nbred for long periods, would vary. Domestication seems to resolve itself\r\ninto a change from the natural conditions of the species [generally\r\nperhaps including an increase of food]; if this be so, organisms in a\r\nstate of nature must _occasionally_, in the course of ages, be exposed\r\nto analogous influences; for geology clearly shows that many places\r\nmust, in the course of time, become exposed to the widest range of\r\nclimatic and other influences; and if such places be isolated, so that\r\nnew and better adapted organic beings cannot freely emigrate, the old\r\ninhabitants will be exposed to new influences, probably far more varied,\r\nthan man applies under the form of domestication. Although every species\r\nno doubt will soon breed up to the full number which the country will\r\nsupport, yet it is easy to conceive that, on an average, some species\r\nmay receive an increase of food; for the times of dearth may be short,\r\nyet enough to kill, and recurrent only at long intervals. All such\r\nchanges of conditions from geological causes would be exceedingly slow;\r\nwhat effect the slowness might have we are ignorant; under domestication\r\nit appears that the effects of change of conditions accumulate, and then\r\nbreak out. Whatever might be the result of these slow geological\r\nchanges, we may feel sure, from the means of dissemination common in a\r\nlesser or greater degree to every organism taken conjointly with the\r\nchanges of geology, which are steadily (and sometimes suddenly, as when\r\nan isthmus at last separates) in progress, that occasionally organisms\r\nmust suddenly be introduced into new regions, where, if the conditions\r\nof existence are not so foreign as to cause its extermination, it will\r\noften be propagated under circumstances still more closely analogous to\r\nthose of domestication; and therefore we expect will evince a tendency\r\nto vary. It appears to me quite _inexplicable_ if this has never\r\nhappened; but it can happen very rarely. Let us then suppose that an\r\norganism by some chance (which might be hardly repeated in 1000 years)\r\narrives at a modern volcanic island in process of formation and not\r\nfully stocked with the most appropriate organisms; the new organism\r\nmight readily gain a footing, although the external conditions were\r\nconsiderably different from its native ones. The effect of this we might\r\nexpect would influence in some small degree the size, colour, nature of\r\ncovering &c., and from inexplicable influences even special parts and\r\norgans of the body. But we might further (and <this> is far more important)\r\nexpect that the reproductive system would be affected, as under\r\ndomesticity, and the structure of the offspring rendered in some degree\r\nplastic. Hence almost every part of the body would tend to vary from the\r\ntypical form in slight degrees, and in no determinate way, and therefore\r\n_without selection_ the free crossing of these small variations\r\n(together with the tendency to reversion to the original form) would\r\nconstantly be counteracting this unsettling effect of the extraneous\r\nconditions on the reproductive system. Such, I conceive, would be the\r\nunimportant result without selection. And here I must observe that the\r\nforegoing remarks are equally applicable to that small and admitted\r\namount of variation which has been observed in some organisms in a state\r\nof nature; as well as to the above hypothetical variation consequent on\r\nchanges of condition.\r\n\r\nLet us now suppose a Being{224} with penetration sufficient to perceive\r\ndifferences in the outer and innermost organization quite imperceptible\r\nto man, and with forethought extending over future centuries to watch\r\nwith unerring care and select for any object the offspring of an\r\norganism produced under the foregoing circumstances; I can see no\r\nconceivable reason why he could not form a new race (or several were he\r\nto separate the stock of the original organism and work on several\r\nislands) adapted to new ends. As we assume his discrimination, and his\r\nforethought, and his steadiness of object, to be incomparably greater\r\nthat those qualities in man, so we may suppose the beauty and\r\ncomplications of the adaptations of the new races and their differences\r\nfrom the original stock to be greater than in the domestic races\r\nproduced by man's agency: the ground-work of his labours we may aid by\r\nsupposing that the external conditions of the volcanic island, from its\r\ncontinued emergence and the occasional introduction of new immigrants,\r\nvary; and thus to act on the reproductive system of the organism, on\r\nwhich he is at work, and so keep its organization somewhat plastic. With\r\ntime enough, such a Being might rationally (without some unknown law\r\nopposed him) aim at almost any result.\r\n\r\n     {224} A corresponding passage occurs in _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 83, vi.\r\n     p. 101, where however Nature takes the place of the selecting\r\n     Being.\r\n\r\nFor instance, let this imaginary Being wish, from seeing a plant growing\r\non the decaying matter in a forest and choked by other plants, to give\r\nit power of growing on the rotten stems of trees, he would commence\r\nselecting every seedling whose berries were in the smallest degree more\r\nattractive to tree-frequenting birds, so as to cause a proper\r\ndissemination of the seeds, and at the same time he would select those\r\nplants which had in the slightest degree more and more power of drawing\r\nnutriment from rotten wood; and he would destroy all other seedlings\r\nwith less of this power. He might thus, in the course of century after\r\ncentury, hope to make the plant by degrees grow on rotten wood, even\r\nhigh up on trees, wherever birds dropped the non-digested seeds. He\r\nmight then, if the organization of the plant was plastic, attempt by\r\ncontinued selection of chance seedlings to make it grow on less and less\r\nrotten wood, till it would grow on sound wood{225}. Supposing again,\r\nduring these changes the plant failed to seed quite freely from\r\nnon-impregnation, he might begin selecting seedlings with a little\r\nsweeter <or> differently tasted honey or pollen, to tempt insects to visit\r\nthe flowers regularly: having effected this, he might wish, if it\r\nprofited the plant, to render abortive the stamens and pistils in\r\ndifferent flowers, which he could do by continued selection. By such\r\nsteps he might aim at making a plant as wonderfully related to other\r\norganic beings as is the mistletoe, whose existence absolutely depends\r\non certain insects for impregnation, certain birds for transportal, and\r\ncertain trees for growth. Furthermore, if the insect which had been\r\ninduced regularly to visit this hypothetical plant profited much by it,\r\nour same Being might wish by selection to modify by gradual selection\r\nthe insect's structure, so as to facilitate its obtaining the honey or\r\npollen: in this manner he might adapt the insect (always presupposing\r\nits organization to be in some degree plastic) to the flower, and the\r\nimpregnation of the flower to the insect; as is the case with many bees\r\nand many plants.\r\n\r\n     {225} The mistletoe is used as an illustration in _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     p. 3, vi. p. 3, but with less detail.\r\n\r\nSeeing what blind capricious man has actually effected by selection\r\nduring the few last years, and what in a ruder state he has probably\r\neffected without any systematic plan during the last few thousand years,\r\nhe will be a bold person who will positively put limits to what the\r\nsupposed Being could effect during whole geological periods. In\r\naccordance with the plan by which this universe seems governed by the\r\nCreator, let us consider whether there exists any _secondary_ means in\r\nthe economy of nature by which the process of selection could go on\r\nadapting, nicely and wonderfully, organisms, if in ever so small a\r\ndegree plastic, to diverse ends. I believe such secondary means do\r\nexist{226}.\r\n\r\n     {226} <Note in original.> The selection, in cases where adult lives\r\n     only few hours as Ephemera, must fall on larva--curious speculation\r\n     of the effect <which> changes in it would bring in parent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Natural means of Selection{227}._\r\n\r\n     {227} This section forms part of the joint paper by Darwin and\r\n     Wallace read before the Linnean Society on July 1, 1858.\r\n\r\nDe Candolle, in an eloquent passage, has declared that all nature is at\r\nwar, one organism with another, or with external nature. Seeing the\r\ncontented face of nature, this may at first be well doubted; but\r\nreflection will inevitably prove it is too true. The war, however, is\r\nnot constant, but only recurrent in a slight degree at short periods and\r\nmore severely at occasional more distant periods; and hence its effects\r\nare easily overlooked. It is the doctrine of Malthus applied in most\r\ncases with ten-fold force. As in every climate there are seasons for\r\neach of its inhabitants of greater and less abundance, so all annually\r\nbreed; and the moral restraint, which in some small degree checks the\r\nincrease of mankind, is entirely lost. Even slow-breeding mankind has\r\ndoubled in 25 years{228}, and if he could increase his food with greater\r\nease, he would double in less time. But for animals, without artificial\r\nmeans, _on an average_ the amount of food for each species must be\r\nconstant; whereas the increase of all organisms tends to be geometrical,\r\nand in a vast majority of cases at an enormous ratio. Suppose in a\r\ncertain spot there are eight pairs of [robins] birds, and that _only_\r\nfour pairs of them annually (including double hatches) rear only four\r\nyoung; and that these go on rearing their young at the same rate: then\r\nat the end of seven years (a short life, excluding violent deaths, for\r\nany birds) there will be 2048 robins, instead of the original sixteen;\r\nas this increase is quite impossible, so we must conclude either that\r\nrobins do not rear nearly half their young or that the average life of a\r\nrobin when reared is from accident not nearly seven years. Both checks\r\nprobably concur. The same kind of calculation applied to all vegetables\r\nand animals produces results either more or less striking, but in\r\nscarcely a single instance less striking than in man{229}.\r\n\r\n     {228} Occurs in _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 64, vi. p. 79.\r\n\r\n     {229} Corresponds approximately with _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 64-65,\r\n     vi. p. 80.\r\n\r\nMany practical illustrations of this rapid tendency to increase are on\r\nrecord, namely during peculiar seasons, in the extraordinary increase of\r\ncertain animals, for instance during the years 1826 to 1828, in La\r\nPlata, when from drought, some millions of cattle perished, the whole\r\ncountry _swarmed_ with innumerable mice: now I think it cannot be\r\ndoubted that during the breeding season all the mice (with the exception\r\nof a few males or females in excess) ordinarily pair; and therefore that\r\nthis astounding increase during three years must be attributed to a\r\ngreater than usual number surviving the first year, and then breeding,\r\nand so on, till the third year, when their numbers were brought down to\r\ntheir usual limits on the return of wet weather. Where man has\r\nintroduced plants and animals into a new country favourable to them,\r\nthere are many accounts in how surprisingly few years the whole country\r\nhas become stocked with them. This increase would necessarily stop as\r\nsoon as the country was fully stocked; and yet we have every reason to\r\nbelieve from what is known of wild animals that _all_ would pair in the\r\nspring. In the majority of cases it is most difficult to imagine where\r\nthe check falls, generally no doubt on the seeds, eggs, and young; but\r\nwhen we remember how impossible even in mankind (so much better known\r\nthan any other animal) it is to infer from repeated casual observations\r\nwhat the average of life is, or to discover how different the percentage\r\nof deaths to the births in different countries, we ought to feel no\r\nlegitimate surprise at not seeing where the check falls in animals and\r\nplants. It should always be remembered that in most cases the checks are\r\nyearly recurrent in a small regular degree, and in an extreme degree\r\nduring occasionally unusually cold, hot, dry, or wet years, according to\r\nthe constitution of the being in question. Lighten any check in the\r\nsmallest degree, and the geometrical power of increase in every\r\norganism will instantly increase the average numbers of the favoured\r\nspecies. Nature may be compared to a surface, on which rest ten thousand\r\nsharp wedges touching each other and driven inwards by incessant\r\nblows{230}. Fully to realise these views much reflection is requisite;\r\nMalthus on man should be studied; and all such cases as those of the\r\nmice in La Plata, of the cattle and horses when first turned out in S.\r\nAmerica, of the robins by our calculation, &c., should be well\r\nconsidered: reflect on the enormous multiplying power _inherent and\r\nannually in action_ in all animals; reflect on the countless seeds\r\nscattered by a hundred ingenious contrivances, year after year, over the\r\nwhole face of the land; and yet we have every reason to suppose that the\r\naverage percentage of every one of the inhabitants of a country will\r\n_ordinarily_ remain constant. Finally, let it be borne in mind that this\r\naverage number of individuals (the external conditions remaining the\r\nsame) in each country is kept up by recurrent struggles against other\r\nspecies or against external nature (as on the borders of the arctic\r\nregions{231}, where the cold checks life); and that ordinarily each\r\nindividual of each species holds its place, either by its own struggle\r\nand capacity of acquiring nourishment in some period (from the egg\r\nupwards) of its life, or by the struggle of its parents (in short lived\r\norganisms, when the main check occurs at long intervals) against and\r\ncompared with other individuals of the _same_ or _different_ species.\r\n\r\n     {230} This simile occurs in _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 67, not in the\r\n     later editions.\r\n\r\n     {231} <Note in the original.> In case like mistletoe, it may be\r\n     asked why not more species, no other species interferes; answer\r\n     almost sufficient, same causes which check the multiplication of\r\n     individuals.\r\n\r\nBut let the external conditions of a country change; if in a small\r\ndegree, the relative proportions of the inhabitants will in most cases\r\nsimply be slightly changed; but let the number of inhabitants be small,\r\nas in an island{232}, and free access to it from other countries be\r\ncircumscribed; and let the change of condition continue progressing\r\n(forming new stations); in such case the original inhabitants must cease\r\nto be so perfectly adapted to the changed conditions as they originally\r\nwere. It has been shown that probably such changes of external\r\nconditions would, from acting on the reproductive system, cause the\r\norganization of the beings most affected to become, as under\r\ndomestication, plastic. Now can it be doubted from the struggle each\r\nindividual (or its parents) has to obtain subsistence that any minute\r\nvariation in structure, habits, or instincts, adapting that individual\r\nbetter to the new conditions, would tell upon its vigour and health? In\r\nthe struggle it would have a better _chance_ of surviving, and those of\r\nits offspring which inherited the variation, let it be ever so slight,\r\nwould have a better _chance_ to survive. Yearly more are bred than can\r\nsurvive; the smallest grain in the balance, in the long run, must tell\r\non which death shall fall, and which shall survive{233}. Let this work\r\nof selection, on the one hand, and death on the other, go on for a\r\nthousand generations; who would pretend to affirm that it would produce\r\nno effect, when we remember what in a few years Bakewell effected in\r\ncattle and Western in sheep, by this identical principle of selection.\r\n\r\n     {232} See _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 104, 292, vi. pp. 127, 429.\r\n\r\n     {233} Recognition of the importance of minute differences in the\r\n     struggle occurs in the Essay of 1842, p. 8 note 3.{Note 59}\r\n\r\nTo give an imaginary example, from changes in progress on an island, let\r\nthe organization{234} of a canine animal become slightly plastic, which\r\nanimal preyed chiefly on rabbits, but sometimes on hares; let these same\r\nchanges cause the number of rabbits very slowly to decrease and the\r\nnumber of hares to increase; the effect of this would be that the fox or\r\ndog would be driven to try to catch more hares, and his numbers would\r\ntend to decrease; his organization, however, being slightly plastic,\r\nthose individuals with the lightest forms, longest limbs, and best\r\neye-sight (though perhaps with less cunning or scent) would be slightly\r\nfavoured, let the difference be ever so small, and would tend to live\r\nlonger and to survive during that time of the year when food was\r\nshortest; they would also rear more young, which young would tend to\r\ninherit these slight peculiarities. The less fleet ones would be rigidly\r\ndestroyed. I can see no more reason to doubt but that these causes in a\r\nthousand generations would produce a marked effect, and adapt the form\r\nof the fox to catching hares instead of rabbits, than that greyhounds\r\ncan be improved by selection and careful breeding. So would it be with\r\nplants under similar circumstances; if the number of individuals of a\r\nspecies with plumed seeds could be increased by greater powers of\r\ndissemination within its own area (that is if the check to increase fell\r\nchiefly on the seeds), those seeds which were provided with ever so\r\nlittle more down, or with a plume placed so as to be slightly more acted\r\non by the winds, would in the long run tend to be most disseminated; and\r\nhence a greater number of seeds thus formed would germinate, and would\r\ntend to produce plants inheriting this slightly better adapted down.\r\n\r\n     {234} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 90, vi. p. 110.\r\n\r\nBesides this natural means of selection, by which those individuals are\r\npreserved, whether in their egg or seed or in their mature state, which\r\nare best adapted to the place they fill in nature, there is a second\r\nagency at work in most bisexual animals tending to produce the same\r\neffect, namely the struggle of the males for the females. These\r\nstruggles are generally decided by the law of battle; but in the case\r\nof birds, apparently, by the charms of their song{235}, by their beauty\r\nor their power of courtship, as in the dancing rock-thrush of Guiana.\r\nEven in the animals which pair there seems to be an excess of males\r\nwhich would aid in causing a struggle: in the polygamous animals{236},\r\nhowever, as in deer, oxen, poultry, we might expect there would be\r\nseverest struggle: is it not in the polygamous animals that the males\r\nare best formed for mutual war? The most vigorous males, implying\r\nperfect adaptation, must generally gain the victory in their several\r\ncontests. This kind of selection, however, is less rigorous than the\r\nother; it does not require the death of the less successful, but gives\r\nto them fewer descendants. This struggle falls, moreover, at a time of\r\nyear when food is generally abundant, and perhaps the effect chiefly\r\nproduced would be the alteration of sexual characters, and the selection\r\nof individual forms, no way related to their power of obtaining food, or\r\nof defending themselves from their natural enemies, but of fighting one\r\nwith another. This natural struggle amongst the males may be compared in\r\neffect, but in a less degree, to that produced by those agriculturalists\r\nwho pay less attention to the careful selection of all the young animals\r\nwhich they breed and more to the occasional use of a choice male{237}.\r\n\r\n     {235} These two forms of sexual selection are given in _Origin_,\r\n     Ed. i. p. 87, vi. p. 107. The Guiana rock-thrush is given as an\r\n     example of bloodless competition.\r\n\r\n     {236} <Note in original.> Seals?

Man\r\nselects chiefly by the eye, and is not able to perceive the course of\r\nevery vessel and nerve, or the form of the bones, or whether the\r\ninternal structure corresponds to the outside shape. He{240} is unable\r\nto select shades of constitutional differences, and by the protection he\r\naffords and his endeavours to keep his property alive, in whatever\r\ncountry he lives, he checks, as much as lies in his power, the selecting\r\naction of nature, which will, however, go on to a lesser degree with all\r\nliving things, even if their length of life is not determined by their\r\nown powers of endurance. He has bad judgment, is capricious, he does\r\nnot, or his successors do not, wish to select for the same exact end for\r\nhundreds of generations. He cannot always suit the selected form to the\r\nproperest conditions; nor does he keep those conditions uniform: he\r\nselects that which is useful to him, not that best adapted to those\r\nconditions in which each variety is placed by him: he selects a small\r\ndog, but feeds it highly; he selects a long-backed dog, but does not\r\nexercise it in any peculiar manner, at least not during every\r\ngeneration. He seldom allows the most vigorous males to struggle for\r\nthemselves and propagate, but picks out such as he possesses, or such as\r\nhe prefers, and not necessarily those best adapted to the existing\r\nconditions. Every agriculturalist and breeder knows how difficult it is\r\nto prevent an occasional cross with another breed. He often grudges to\r\ndestroy an individual which departs considerably from the required type.\r\nHe often begins his selection by a form or sport considerably departing\r\nfrom the parent form. Very differently does the natural law of selection\r\nact; the varieties selected differ only slightly from the parent\r\nforms{241}; the conditions are constant for long periods and change\r\nslowly; rarely can there be a cross; the selection is rigid and\r\nunfailing, and continued through many generations; a selection can\r\n_never be made_ without the form be _better_ adapted to the conditions\r\nthan the parent form; the selecting power goes on without caprice, and\r\nsteadily for thousands of years adapting the form to these conditions.\r\nThe selecting power is not deceived by external appearances, it tries\r\nthe being during its whole life; and if less well <?> adapted than its\r\n_congeners_, without fail it is destroyed; every part of its structure\r\nis thus scrutinised and proved good towards the place in nature which it\r\noccupies.\r\n\r\n     {238} In the _Origin_ the author would here have used the word\r\n     _variety_.\r\n\r\n     {239} The whole of p. 94 and 15 lines of p. 95 are, in the MS.,\r\n     marked through in pencil with vertical lines, beginning at \"Races\r\n     produced, &c.\" and ending with \"to these conditions.\"\r\n\r\n     {240} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 83, vi. p. 102.\r\n\r\n     {241} In the present Essay there is some evidence that the author\r\n     attributed more to _sports_ than was afterwards the case: but the\r\n     above passage points the other way. It must always be remembered\r\n     that many of the minute differences, now considered small\r\n     mutations, are the small variations on which Darwin conceived\r\n     selection to act.\r\n\r\nWe have every reason to believe that in proportion to the number of\r\ngenerations that a domestic race is kept free from crosses, and to the\r\ncare employed in continued steady selection with one end in view, and to\r\nthe care in not placing the variety in conditions unsuited to it; in\r\nsuch proportion does the new race become \"true\" or subject to little\r\nvariation{242}. How incomparably \"truer\" then would a race produced by\r\nthe above rigid, steady, natural means of selection, excellently trained\r\nand perfectly adapted to its conditions, free from stains of blood or\r\ncrosses, and continued during thousands of years, be compared with one\r\nproduced by the feeble, capricious, misdirected and ill-adapted\r\nselection of man. Those races of domestic animals produced by savages,\r\npartly by the inevitable conditions of their life, and partly\r\nunintentionally by their greater care of the individuals most valuable\r\nto them, would probably approach closest to the character of a species;\r\nand I believe this is the case. Now the characteristic mark of a\r\nspecies, next, if not equal in importance to its sterility when crossed\r\nwith another species, and indeed almost the only other character\r\n(without we beg the question and affirm the essence of a species, is its\r\nnot having descended from a parent common to any other form), is the\r\nsimilarity of the individuals composing the species, or in the language\r\nof agriculturalists their \"trueness.\"\r\n\r\n     {242} See _Var. under Dom._, Ed. ii. vol. II. p. 230.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difference between \"Races\" and \"Species\" in fertility when crossed._\r\n\r\nThe sterility of species, or of their offspring, when crossed has,\r\nhowever, received more attention than the uniformity in character of the\r\nindividuals composing the species. It is exceedingly natural that such\r\nsterility{243} should have been long thought the certain characteristic\r\nof species. For it is obvious that if the allied different forms which\r\nwe meet with in the same country could cross together, instead of\r\nfinding a number of distinct species, we should have a confused and\r\nblending series. The fact however of a perfect gradation in the degree\r\nof sterility between species, and the circumstance of some species most\r\nclosely allied (for instance many species of crocus and European heaths)\r\nrefusing to breed together, whereas other species, widely different,\r\nand even belonging to distinct genera, as the fowl and the peacock,\r\npheasant and grouse{244}, Azalea and Rhododendron, Thuja and Juniperus,\r\nbreeding together ought to have caused a doubt whether the sterility did\r\nnot depend on other causes, distinct from a law, coincident with their\r\ncreation. I may here remark that the fact whether one species will or\r\nwill not breed with another is far less important than the sterility of\r\nthe offspring when produced; for even some domestic races differ so\r\ngreatly in size (as the great stag-greyhound and lap-dog, or cart-horse\r\nand Burmese ponies) that union is nearly impossible; and what is less\r\ngenerally known is, that in plants Kölreuter has shown by hundreds of\r\nexperiments that the pollen of one species will fecundate the germen of\r\nanother species, whereas the pollen of this latter will never act on the\r\ngermen of the former; so that the simple fact of mutual impregnation\r\ncertainly has no relation whatever to the distinctness in creation of\r\nthe two forms. When two species are attempted to be crossed which are so\r\ndistantly allied that offspring are never produced, it has been observed\r\nin some cases that the pollen commences its proper action by exserting\r\nits tube, and the germen commences swelling, though soon afterwards it\r\ndecays. In the next stage in the series, hybrid offspring are produced\r\nthough only rarely and few in number, and these are absolutely sterile:\r\nthen we have hybrid offspring more numerous, and occasionally, though\r\nvery rarely, breeding with either parent, as is the case with the common\r\nmule. Again, other hybrids, though infertile _inter se_, will breed\r\n_quite_ freely with either parent, or with a third species, and will\r\nyield offspring generally infertile, but sometimes fertile; and these\r\nlatter again will breed with either parent, or with a third or fourth\r\nspecies: thus Kölreuter blended together many forms. Lastly it is now\r\nadmitted by those botanists who have longest contended against the\r\nadmission, that in certain families the hybrid offspring of many of the\r\nspecies are sometimes perfectly fertile in the first generation when\r\nbred together: indeed in some few cases Mr Herbert{245} found that the\r\nhybrids were decidedly more fertile than either of their pure parents.\r\nThere is no way to escape from the admission that the hybrids from some\r\nspecies of plants are fertile, except by declaring that no form shall be\r\nconsidered as a species, if it produces with another species fertile\r\noffspring: but this is begging the question{246}. It has often been\r\nstated that different species of animals have a sexual repugnance\r\ntowards each other; I can find no evidence of this; it appears as if\r\nthey merely did not excite each others passions. I do not believe that\r\nin this respect there is any essential distinction between animals and\r\nplants; and in the latter there cannot be a feeling of repugnance.\r\n\r\n     {243} <Note in the original.> If domestic animals are descended from\r\n     several species and _become_ fertile _inter se_, then one can see\r\n     they gain fertility by becoming adapted to new conditions and\r\n     certainly domestic animals can withstand changes of climate without\r\n     loss of fertility in an astonishing manner.\r\n\r\n     {244} See Suchetet, _L'Hybridité dans la Nature_, Bruxelles, 1888,\r\n     p. 67. In _Var. under Dom._, Ed. ii. vol. II. hybrids between the\r\n     fowl and the pheasant are mentioned. I can give no information on\r\n     the other cases.\r\n\r\n     {245} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 250, vi. p. 370.\r\n\r\n     {246} This was the position of Gärtner and of Kölreuter: see\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 246-7, vi. pp. 367-8.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Causes of Sterility in Hybrids._\r\n\r\nThe difference in nature between species which causes the greater or\r\nlesser degree of sterility in their offspring appears, according to\r\nHerbert and Kölreuter, to be connected much less with external form,\r\nsize, or structure, than with constitutional peculiarities; by which is\r\nmeant their adaptation to different climates, food and situation, &c.:\r\nthese peculiarities of constitution probably affect the entire frame,\r\nand no one part in particular{247}.\r\n\r\n     {247} <Note in the original.> Yet this seems introductory to the\r\n     case of the heaths and crocuses above mentioned. <Herbert observed\r\n     that crocus does not set seed if transplanted before pollination,\r\n     but that such treatment after pollination has no sterilising effect.\r\n     (_Var. under Dom._, Ed. ii. vol. II. p. 148.) On the same page is\r\n     a mention of the Ericaceæ being subject to contabescence of the\r\n     anthers. For _Crinum_ see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 250: for _Rhododenron_\r\n     and _Calceolaria_ see p. 251.>\r\n\r\nFrom the foregoing facts I think we must admit that there exists a\r\nperfect gradation in fertility between species which when crossed are\r\nquite fertile (as in Rhododendron, Calceolaria, &c.), and indeed in an\r\nextraordinary degree fertile (as in Crinum), and those species which\r\nnever produce offspring, but which by certain effects (as the exsertion\r\nof the pollen-tube) evince their alliance. Hence, I conceive, we must\r\ngive up sterility, although undoubtedly in a lesser or greater degree of\r\nvery frequent occurrence, as an unfailing mark by which _species_ can be\r\ndistinguished from _races_, _i.e._ from those forms which have descended\r\nfrom a common stock.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Infertility from causes distinct from hybridisation._\r\n\r\nLet us see whether there are any analogous facts which will throw any\r\nlight on this subject, and will tend to explain why the offspring of\r\ncertain species, when crossed, should be sterile, and not others,\r\nwithout requiring a distinct law connected with their creation to that\r\neffect. Great numbers, probably a large majority of animals when caught\r\nby man and removed from their natural conditions, although taken very\r\nyoung, rendered quite tame, living to a good old age, and apparently\r\nquite healthy, seem incapable under these circumstances of\r\nbreeding{248}. I do not refer to animals kept in menageries, such as at\r\nthe Zoological Gardens, many of which, however, appear healthy and live\r\nlong and unite but do not produce; but to animals caught and left partly\r\nat liberty in their native country. Rengger{249} enumerates several\r\ncaught young and rendered tame, which he kept in Paraguay, and which\r\nwould not breed: the hunting leopard or cheetah and elephant offer other\r\ninstances; as do bears in Europe, and the 25 species of hawks, belonging\r\nto different genera, thousands of which have been kept for hawking and\r\nhave lived for long periods in perfect vigour. When the expense and\r\ntrouble of procuring a succession of young animals in a wild state be\r\nborne in mind, one may feel sure that no trouble has been spared in\r\nendeavours to make them breed. So clearly marked is this difference in\r\ndifferent kinds of animals, when captured by man, that St Hilaire makes\r\ntwo great classes of animals useful to man:--the _tame_, which will not\r\nbreed, and the _domestic_ which will breed in domestication. From\r\ncertain singular facts we might have supposed that the non-breeding of\r\nanimals was owing to some perversion of instinct. But we meet with\r\nexactly the same class of facts in plants: I do not refer to the large\r\nnumber of cases where the climate does not permit the seed or fruit to\r\nripen, but where the flowers do not \"set,\" owing to some imperfection of\r\nthe ovule or pollen. The latter, which alone can be distinctly examined,\r\nis often manifestly imperfect, as any one with a microscope can observe\r\nby comparing the pollen of the Persian and Chinese lilacs{250} with the\r\ncommon lilac; the two former species (I may add) are equally sterile in\r\nItaly as in this country. Many of the American bog plants here produce\r\nlittle or no pollen, whilst the Indian species of the same genera freely\r\nproduce it. Lindley observes that sterility is the bane of the\r\nhorticulturist{251}: Linnæus has remarked on the sterility of nearly all\r\nalpine flowers when cultivated in a lowland district{252}. Perhaps the\r\nimmense class of double flowers chiefly owe their structure to an excess\r\nof food acting on parts rendered slightly sterile and less capable of\r\nperforming their true function, and therefore liable to be rendered\r\nmonstrous, which monstrosity, like any other disease, is inherited and\r\nrendered common. So far from domestication being in itself unfavourable\r\nto fertility, it is well known that when an organism is once capable of\r\nsubmission to such conditions <its> fertility is increased{253} beyond the\r\nnatural limit. According to agriculturists, slight changes of\r\nconditions, that is of food or habitation, and likewise crosses with\r\nraces slightly different, increase the vigour and probably the fertility\r\nof their offspring. It would appear also that even a great change of\r\ncondition, for instance, transportal from temperate countries to India,\r\nin many cases does not in the least affect fertility, although it does\r\nhealth and length of life and the period of maturity. When sterility is\r\ninduced by domestication it is of the same kind, and varies in degree,\r\nexactly as with hybrids: for be it remembered that the most sterile\r\nhybrid is no way monstrous; its organs are perfect, but they do not act,\r\nand minute microscopical investigations show that they are in the same\r\nstate as those of pure species in the intervals of the breeding season.\r\nThe defective pollen in the cases above alluded to precisely resembles\r\nthat of hybrids. The occasional breeding of hybrids, as of the common\r\nmule, may be aptly compared to the most rare but occasional reproduction\r\nof elephants in captivity. The cause of many exotic Geraniums producing\r\n(although in vigorous health) imperfect pollen seems to be connected\r\nwith the period when water is given them{254}; but in the far greater\r\nmajority of cases we cannot form any conjecture on what exact cause the\r\nsterility of organisms taken from their natural conditions depends. Why,\r\nfor instance, the cheetah will not breed whilst the common cat and\r\nferret (the latter generally kept shut up in a small box) do,--why the\r\nelephant will not whilst the pig will abundantly--why the partridge and\r\ngrouse in their own country will not, whilst several species of\r\npheasants, the guinea-fowl from the deserts of Africa and the peacock\r\nfrom the jungles of India, will. We must, however, feel convinced that\r\nit depends on some constitutional peculiarities in these beings not\r\nsuited to their new condition; though not necessarily causing an ill\r\nstate of health. Ought we then to wonder much that those hybrids which\r\nhave been produced by the crossing of species with different\r\nconstitutional tendencies (which tendencies we know to be eminently\r\ninheritable) should be sterile: it does not seem improbable that the\r\ncross from an alpine and lowland plant should have its constitutional\r\npowers deranged, in nearly the same manner as when the parent alpine\r\nplant is brought into a lowland district. Analogy, however, is a\r\ndeceitful guide, and it would be rash to affirm, although it may appear\r\nprobable, that the sterility of hybrids is due to the constitutional\r\npeculiarities of one parent being disturbed by being blended with those\r\nof the other parent in exactly the same manner as it is caused in some\r\norganic beings when placed by man out of their natural conditions{255}.\r\nAlthough this would be rash, it would, I think, be still rasher, seeing\r\nthat sterility is no more incidental to _all_ cross-bred productions\r\nthan it is to all organic beings when captured by man, to assert that\r\nthe sterility of certain hybrids proved a distinct creation of their\r\nparents.\r\n\r\n     {248} <Note in original.> Animals seem more often made sterile by\r\n     being taken out of their native condition than plants, and so are\r\n     more sterile when crossed.\r\n\r\n     We have one broad fact that sterility in hybrids is not closely\r\n     related to external difference, and these are what man alone gets\r\n     by selection.\r\n\r\n     {249} See _Var. under Dom._, Ed. ii. vol. II. p. 132; for the case\r\n     of the cheetah see _loc cit._ p. 133.\r\n\r\n     {250} _Var. under Dom._, Ed. ii. vol.

This is the principle\r\n     experimentally investigated in the author's _Cross-and\r\n     Self-Fertilisation_.\r\n\r\nBut it may be objected{256} (however little the sterility of certain\r\nhybrids is connected with the distinct creations of species), how comes\r\nit, if species are only races produced by natural selection, that when\r\ncrossed they so frequently produce sterile offspring, whereas in the\r\noffspring of those races confessedly produced by the arts of man there\r\nis no one instance of sterility. There is not much difficulty in this,\r\nfor the races produced by the natural means above explained will be\r\nslowly but steadily selected; will be adapted to various and diverse\r\nconditions, and to these conditions they will be rigidly confined for\r\nimmense periods of time; hence we may suppose that they would acquire\r\ndifferent constitutional peculiarities adapted to the stations they\r\noccupy; and on the constitutional differences between species their\r\nsterility, according to the best authorities, depends. On the other hand\r\nman selects by external appearance{257}; from his ignorance, and from\r\nnot having any test at least comparable in delicacy to the natural\r\nstruggle for food, continued at intervals through the life of each\r\nindividual, he cannot eliminate fine shades of constitution, dependent\r\non invisible differences in the fluids or solids of the body; again,\r\nfrom the value which he attaches to each individual, he asserts his\r\nutmost power in contravening the natural tendency of the most vigorous\r\nto survive. Man, moreover, especially in the earlier ages, cannot have\r\nkept his conditions of life constant, and in later ages his stock pure.\r\nUntil man selects two varieties from the same stock, adapted to two\r\nclimates or to other different external conditions, and confines each\r\nrigidly for one or several thousand years to such conditions, always\r\nselecting the individuals best adapted to them, he cannot be said to\r\nhave even commenced the experiment. Moreover, the organic beings which\r\nman has longest had under domestication have been those which were of\r\nthe greatest use to him, and one chief element of their usefulness,\r\nespecially in the earlier ages, must have been their capacity to undergo\r\nsudden transportals into various climates, and at the same time to\r\nretain their fertility, which in itself implies that in such respects\r\ntheir constitutional peculiarities were not closely limited. If the\r\nopinion already mentioned be correct, that most of the domestic animals\r\nin their present state have descended from the fertile commixture of\r\nwild races or species, we have indeed little reason now to expect\r\ninfertility between any cross of stock thus descended.\r\n\r\n     {256} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 268, vi. p. 398.\r\n\r\n     {257} <Notes in original.> Mere difference of structure no guide to\r\n     what will or will not cross. First step gained by races keeping\r\n     apart. <It is not clear where these notes were meant to go.>\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of remark, that as many organic beings, when taken by man\r\nout of their natural conditions, have their reproductive system <so>\r\naffected as to be incapable of propagation, so, we saw in the first\r\nchapter, that although organic beings when taken by man do propagate\r\nfreely, their offspring after some generations vary or sport to a degree\r\nwhich can only be explained by their reproductive system being <in> some way\r\naffected. Again, when species cross, their offspring are generally\r\nsterile; but it was found by Kölreuter that when hybrids are capable of\r\nbreeding with either parent, or with other species, that their\r\noffspring are subject after some generations to excessive\r\nvariation{258}. Agriculturists, also, affirm that the offspring from\r\nmongrels, after the first generation, vary much. Hence we see that both\r\nsterility and variation in the succeeding generations are consequent\r\nboth on the removal of individual species from their natural states and\r\non species crossing. The connection between these facts may be\r\naccidental, but they certainly appear to elucidate and support each\r\nother,--on the principle of the reproductive system of all organic\r\nbeings being eminently sensitive to any disturbance, whether from\r\nremoval or commixture, in their constitutional relations to the\r\nconditions to which they are exposed.\r\n\r\n     {258} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 272, vi. p. 404.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Points of Resemblance between \"Races\" and \"Species{259}.\"_\r\n\r\n     {259} This section seems not to correspond closely with any in the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i.; in some points it resembles pp. 15, 16, also the\r\n     section on analogous variation in distinct species, _Origin_, Ed.\r\n     i. p. 159, vi. p. 194.\r\n\r\nRaces and reputed species agree in some respects, although differing\r\nfrom causes which, we have seen, we can in some degree understand, in\r\nthe fertility and \"trueness\" of their offspring. In the first place,\r\nthere is no clear sign by which to distinguish races from species, as is\r\nevident from the great difficulty experienced by naturalists in\r\nattempting to discriminate them. As far as external characters are\r\nconcerned, many of the races which are descended from the same stock\r\ndiffer far more than true species of the same genus; look at the\r\nwillow-wrens, some of which skilful ornithologists can hardly\r\ndistinguish from each other except by their nests; look at the wild\r\nswans, and compare the distinct species of these genera with the races\r\nof domestic ducks, poultry, and pigeons; and so again with plants,\r\ncompare the cabbages, almonds, peaches and nectarines, &c. with the\r\nspecies of many genera. St Hilaire has even remarked that there is a\r\ngreater difference in size between races, as in dogs (for he believes\r\nall have descended from one stock), than between the species of any one\r\ngenus; nor is this surprising, considering that amount of food and\r\nconsequently of growth is the element of change over which man has most\r\npower. I may refer to a former statement, that breeders believe the\r\ngrowth of one part or strong action of one function causes a decrease in\r\nother parts; for this seems in some degree analogous to the law of\r\n\"organic compensation{260},\" which many naturalists believe holds good.\r\nTo give an instance of this law of compensation,--those species of\r\nCarnivora which have the canine teeth greatly developed have certain\r\nmolar teeth deficient; or again, in that division of the Crustaceans in\r\nwhich the tail is much developed, the thorax is little so, and the\r\nconverse. The points of difference between different races is often\r\nstrikingly analogous to that between species of the same genus: trifling\r\nspots or marks of colour{261} (as the bars on pigeons' wings) are often\r\npreserved in races of plants and animals, precisely in the same manner\r\nas similar trifling characters often pervade all the species of a genus,\r\nand even of a family. Flowers in varying their colours often become\r\nveined and spotted and the leaves become divided like true species: it\r\nis known that the varieties of the same plant never have red, blue and\r\nyellow flowers, though the hyacinth makes a very near approach to an\r\nexception{262}; and different species of the same genus seldom, though\r\nsometimes they have flowers of these three colours. Dun-coloured horses\r\nhaving a dark stripe down their backs, and certain domestic asses having\r\ntransverse bars on their legs, afford striking examples of a variation\r\nanalogous in character to the distinctive marks of other species of the\r\nsame genus.\r\n\r\n     {260} The law of compensation is discussed in the _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     p. 147, vi. p. 182.\r\n\r\n     {261} <Note in original.> Boitard and Corbié on outer edging red in\r\n     tail of bird,--so bars on wing, white or black or brown, or white\r\n     edged with black or <illegible>: analogous to marks running through\r\n     genera but with different colours.

It would, I think, be a marvellous fact, if species have\r\nbeen formed by distinct acts of creation, that they should act upon each\r\nother in uniting, like races descended from a common stock. In the first\r\nplace, by repeated crossing one species can absorb and wholly obliterate\r\nthe characters of another, or of several other species, in the same\r\nmanner as one race will absorb by crossing another race. Marvellous,\r\nthat one act of creation should absorb another or even several acts of\r\ncreation! The offspring of species, that is hybrids, and the offspring\r\nof races, that is mongrels, resemble each other in being either\r\nintermediate in character (as is most frequent in hybrids) or in\r\nresembling sometimes closely one and sometimes the other parent; in both\r\nthe offspring produced by the same act of conception sometimes differ in\r\ntheir degree of resemblance; both hybrids and mongrels sometimes retain\r\na certain part or organ very like that of either parent, both, as we\r\nhave seen, become in succeeding generations variable; and this tendency\r\nto vary can be transmitted by both; in both for many generations there\r\nis a strong tendency to reversion to their ancestral form. In the case\r\nof a hybrid laburnum and of a supposed mongrel vine different parts of\r\nthe same plants took after each of their two parents. In the hybrids\r\nfrom some species, and in the mongrel of some races, the offspring\r\ndiffer according as which of the two species, or of the two races, is\r\nthe father (as in the common mule and hinny) and which the mother. Some\r\nraces will breed together, which differ so greatly in size, that the dam\r\noften perishes in labour; so it is with some species when crossed; when\r\nthe dam of one species has borne offspring to the male of another\r\nspecies, her succeeding offspring are sometimes stained (as in Lord\r\nMorton's mare by the quagga, wonderful as the fact{264} is) by this\r\nfirst cross; so agriculturists positively affirm is the case when a pig\r\nor sheep of one breed has produced offspring by the sire of another\r\nbreed.\r\n\r\n     {263} This section corresponds roughly to that on _Hybrids and\r\n     Mongrels compared independently of their fertility_, _Origin_, Ed.\r\n     i. p. 272, vi. p. 403. The discussion on Gärtner's views, given in\r\n     the _Origin_, is here wanting. The brief mention of prepotency is\r\n     common to them both.\r\n\r\n     {264} See _Animals and Plants_, Ed. ii. vol. I. p. 435. The\r\n     phenomenon of _Telegony_, supposed to be established by this and\r\n     similar cases, is now generally discredited in consequence of\r\n     Ewart's experiments.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary of second chapter_{265}.\r\n\r\n     {265} The section on p. 109 is an appendix to the summary.\r\n\r\nLet us sum up this second chapter. If slight variations do occur in\r\norganic beings in a state of nature; if changes of condition from\r\ngeological causes do produce in the course of ages effects analogous to\r\nthose of domestication on any, however few, organisms; and how can we\r\ndoubt it,--from what is actually known, and from what may be presumed,\r\nsince thousands of organisms taken by man for sundry uses, and placed\r\nin new conditions, have varied. If such variations tend to be\r\nhereditary; and how can we doubt it,--when we see shades of expression,\r\npeculiar manners, monstrosities of the strangest kinds, diseases, and a\r\nmultitude of other peculiarities, which characterise and form, being\r\ninherited, the endless races (there are 1200 kinds of cabbages{266}) of\r\nour domestic plants and animals. If we admit that every organism\r\nmaintains its place by an almost periodically recurrent struggle; and\r\nhow can we doubt it,--when we know that all beings tend to increase in a\r\ngeometrical ratio (as is instantly seen when the conditions become for a\r\ntime more favourable); whereas on an average the amount of food must\r\nremain constant, if so, there will be a natural means of selection,\r\ntending to preserve those individuals with any slight deviations of\r\nstructure more favourable to the then existing conditions, and tending\r\nto destroy any with deviations of an opposite nature. If the above\r\npropositions be correct, and there be no law of nature limiting the\r\npossible amount of variation, new races of beings will,--perhaps only\r\nrarely, and only in some few districts,--be formed.\r\n\r\n     {266} I do not know the authority for this statement.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Limits of Variation._\r\n\r\nThat a limit to variation does exist in nature is assumed by most\r\nauthors, though I am unable to discover a single fact on which this\r\nbelief is grounded{267}. One of the commonest statements is that plants\r\ndo not become acclimatised; and I have even observed that kinds not\r\nraised by seed, but propagated by cuttings, &c., are instanced. A good\r\ninstance has, however, been advanced in the case of kidney beans, which\r\nit is believed are now as tender as when first introduced. Even if we\r\noverlook the frequent introduction of seed from warmer countries, let me\r\nobserve that as long as the seeds are gathered promiscuously from the\r\nbed, without continual observation and _careful_ selection of those\r\nplants which have stood the climate best during their whole growth, the\r\nexperiment of acclimatisation has hardly been begun. Are not all those\r\nplants and animals, of which we have the greatest number of races, the\r\noldest domesticated? Considering the quite recent progress{268} of\r\nsystematic agriculture and horticulture, is it not opposed to every\r\nfact, that we have exhausted the capacity of variation in our cattle and\r\nin our corn,--even if we have done so in some trivial points, as their\r\nfatness or kind of wool? Will any one say, that if horticulture\r\ncontinues to flourish during the next few centuries, that we shall not\r\nhave numerous new kinds of the potato and Dahlia? But take two varieties\r\nof each of these plants, and adapt them to certain fixed conditions and\r\nprevent any cross for 5000 years, and then again vary their conditions;\r\ntry many climates and situations; and who{269} will predict the number\r\nand degrees of difference which might arise from these stocks? I repeat\r\nthat we know nothing of any limit to the possible amount of variation,\r\nand therefore to the number and differences of the races, which might be\r\nproduced by the natural means of selection, so infinitely more efficient\r\nthan the agency of man. Races thus produced would probably be very\r\n\"true\"; and if from having been adapted to different conditions of\r\nexistence, they possessed different constitutions, if suddenly removed\r\nto some new station, they would perhaps be sterile and their offspring\r\nwould perhaps be infertile. Such races would be undistinguishable from\r\nspecies. But is there any evidence that the species, which surround us\r\non all sides, have been thus produced? This is a question which an\r\nexamination of the economy of nature we might expect would answer either\r\nin the affirmative or negative{270}.\r\n\r\n     {267} In the _Origin_ no limit is placed to variation as far as I\r\n     know.\r\n\r\n     {268} <Note in original.> History of pigeons shows increase of\r\n     peculiarities during last years.\r\n\r\n     {269} Compare an obscure passage in the Essay of 1842, p. 14.\r\n\r\n     {270} <Note in original.> Certainly <two pages in the MS.> ought to\r\n     be here introduced, viz., difficulty in forming such organ, as eye,\r\n     by selection. <In the _Origin_, Ed. i., a chapter on _Difficulties\r\n     on Theory_ follows that on _Laws of Variation_, and precedes that\r\n     on _Instinct_: this was also the arrangement in the Essay of 1842;\r\n     whereas in the present Essay _Instinct_ follows _Variation_ and\r\n     precedes _Difficulties_.>\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III\r\n\r\nON THE VARIATION OF INSTINCTS AND OTHER MENTAL ATTRIBUTES UNDER\r\nDOMESTICATION AND IN STATE OF NATURE; ON THE DIFFICULTIES IN THIS\r\nSUBJECT; AND ON ANALOGOUS DIFFICULTIES WITH RESPECT TO CORPOREAL\r\nSTRUCTURES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variation of mental attributes under domestication._\r\n\r\nI have as yet only alluded to the mental qualities which differ greatly\r\nin different species. Let me here premise that, as will be seen in the\r\nSecond Part, there is no evidence and consequently no attempt to show\r\nthat _all_ existing organisms have descended from any one common\r\nparent-stock, but that only those have so descended which, in the\r\nlanguage of naturalists, are clearly related to each other. Hence the\r\nfacts and reasoning advanced in this chapter do not apply to the first\r\norigin of the senses{271}, or of the chief mental attributes, such as of\r\nmemory, attention, reasoning, &c., &c., by which most or all of the\r\ngreat related groups are characterised, any more than they apply to the\r\nfirst origin of life, or growth, or the power of reproduction. The\r\napplication of such facts as I have collected is merely to the\r\ndifferences of the primary mental qualities and of the instincts in the\r\nspecies{272} of the several great groups. In domestic animals every\r\nobserver has remarked in how great a degree, in the individuals of the\r\nsame species, the dispositions, namely courage, pertinacity, suspicion,\r\nrestlessness, confidence, temper, pugnaciousness, affection, care of\r\ntheir young, sagacity, &c., &c., vary. It would require a most able\r\nmetaphysician to explain how many primary qualities of the mind must be\r\nchanged to cause these diversities of complex dispositions. From these\r\ndispositions being inherited, of which the testimony is unanimous,\r\nfamilies and breeds arise, varying in these respects. I may instance the\r\ngood and ill temper of different stocks of bees and of horses,--the\r\npugnacity and courage of game fowls,--the pertinacity of certain dogs,\r\nas bull-dogs, and the sagacity of others,--for restlessness and\r\nsuspicion compare a wild rabbit reared with the greatest care from its\r\nearliest age with the extreme tameness of the domestic breed of the same\r\nanimal. The offspring of the domestic dogs which have run wild in\r\nCuba{273}, though caught quite young, are most difficult to tame,\r\nprobably nearly as much so as the original parent-stock from which the\r\ndomestic dog descended. The habitual \"_periods_\" of different families\r\nof the same species differ, for instance, in the time of year of\r\nreproduction, and the period of life when the capacity is acquired, and\r\nthe hour of roosting (in Malay fowls), &c., &c. These periodical habits\r\nare perhaps essentially corporeal, and may be compared to nearly similar\r\nhabits in plants, which are known to vary extremely. Consensual\r\nmovements (as called by Müller) vary and are inherited,--such as the\r\ncantering and ambling paces in horses, the tumbling of pigeons, and\r\nperhaps the handwriting, which is sometimes so similar between father\r\nand sons, may be ranked in this class. _Manners_, and even tricks which\r\nperhaps are only _peculiar_ manners, according to W. Hunter and my\r\nfather, are distinctly inherited in cases where children have lost their\r\nparent in early infancy. The inheritance of expression, which often\r\nreveals the finest shades of character, is familiar to everyone.\r\n\r\n     {271} A similar proviso occurs in the chapter on instinct in\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 207, vi. p. 319.\r\n\r\n     {272} The discussion occurs later in Chapter VII of the _Origin_,\r\n     Ed. i. than in the present Essay, where moreover it is fuller in\r\n     some respects.\r\n\r\n     {273} In the margin occurs the name of Poeppig. In _Var. under\r\n     Dom._, Ed. ii. vol. I. p. 28, the reference to Poeppig on the Cuban\r\n     dogs contains no mention of the wildness of their offspring.\r\n\r\nAgain the tastes and pleasures of different breeds vary, thus the\r\nshepherd-dog delights in chasing the sheep, but has no wish to kill\r\nthem,--the terrier (see Knight) delights in killing vermin, and the\r\nspaniel in finding game. But it is impossible to separate their mental\r\npeculiarities in the way I have done: the tumbling of pigeons, which I\r\nhave instanced as a consensual movement, might be called a trick and is\r\nassociated with a taste for flying in a close flock at a great height.\r\nCertain breeds of fowls have a taste for roosting in trees. The\r\ndifferent actions of pointers and setters might have been adduced in the\r\nsame class, as might the peculiar _manner_ of hunting of the spaniel.\r\nEven in the same breed of dogs, namely in fox-hounds, it is the fixed\r\nopinion of those best able to judge that the different pups are born\r\nwith different tendencies; some are best to find their fox in the cover;\r\nsome are apt to run straggling, some are best to make casts and to\r\nrecover the lost scent, &c.; and that these peculiarities undoubtedly\r\nare transmitted to their progeny. Or again the tendency to point might\r\nbe adduced as a distinct habit which has become inherited,--as might the\r\ntendency of a true sheep dog (as I have been assured is the case) to run\r\nround the flock instead of directly at them, as is the case with other\r\nyoung dogs when attempted to be taught. The \"transandantes\" sheep{274}\r\nin Spain, which for some centuries have been yearly taken a journey of\r\nseveral hundred miles from one province to another, know when the time\r\ncomes, and show the greatest restlessness (like migratory birds in\r\nconfinement), and are prevented with difficulty from starting by\r\nthemselves, which they sometimes do, and find their own way. There is a\r\ncase on good evidence{275} of a sheep which, when she lambed, would\r\nreturn across a mountainous country to her own birth-place, although at\r\nother times of year not of a rambling disposition. Her lambs inherited\r\nthis same disposition, and would go to produce their young on the farm\r\nwhence their parent came; and so troublesome was this habit that the\r\nwhole family was destroyed.\r\n\r\n     {274} <Note in original.> Several authors.\r\n\r\n     {275} In the margin \"Hogg\" occurs as authority for this fact. For\r\n     the reference, see p. 17, note 4.\r\n\r\nThese facts must lead to the conviction, justly wonderful as it is, that\r\nalmost infinitely numerous shades of disposition, of tastes, of peculiar\r\nmovements, and even of individual actions, can be modified or acquired\r\nby one individual and transmitted to its offspring. One is forced to\r\nadmit that mental phenomena (no doubt through their intimate connection\r\nwith the brain) can be inherited, like infinitely numerous and fine\r\ndifferences of corporeal structure. In the same manner as peculiarities\r\nof corporeal structure slowly acquired or lost during mature life\r\n(especially cognisant <?> in disease), as well as congenital peculiarities,\r\nare transmitted; so it appears to be with the mind. The inherited paces\r\nin the horse have no doubt been acquired by compulsion during the lives\r\nof the parents: and temper and tameness may be modified in a breed by\r\nthe treatment which the individuals receive. Knowing that a pig has been\r\ntaught to point, one would suppose that this quality in pointer-dogs was\r\nthe simple result of habit, but some facts, with respect to the\r\noccasional appearance of a similar quality in other dogs, would make one\r\nsuspect that it originally appeared in a less perfect degree, \"_by\r\nchance_,\" that is from a congenital tendency{276} in the parent of the\r\nbreed of pointers. One cannot believe that the tumbling, and high flight\r\nin a compact body, of one breed of pigeons has been taught; and in the\r\ncase of the slight differences in the manner of hunting in young\r\nfox-hounds, they are doubtless congenital. The inheritance of the\r\nforegoing and similar mental phenomena ought perhaps to create less\r\nsurprise, from the reflection that in no case do individual acts of\r\nreasoning, or movements, or other phenomena connected with\r\nconsciousness, appear to be transmitted. An action, even a very\r\ncomplicated one, when from long practice it is performed unconsciously\r\nwithout any effort (and indeed in the case of many peculiarities of\r\nmanners opposed to the will) is said, according to a common expression,\r\nto be performed \"instinctively.\" Those cases of languages, and of songs,\r\nlearnt in early childhood and _quite_ forgotten, being _perfectly_\r\nrepeated during the unconsciousness of illness, appear to me only a few\r\ndegrees less wonderful than if they had been transmitted to a second\r\ngeneration{277}.\r\n\r\n     {276} In the _Origin_, Ed. i., he speaks more decidedly against the\r\n     belief that instincts are hereditary habits, see for instance pp.\r\n     209, 214, Ed. vi. pp. 321, 327. He allows, however, something to\r\n     habit (p. 216).\r\n\r\n     {277} A suggestion of Hering's and S. Butler's views on memory and\r\n     inheritance. It is not, however, implied that Darwin was inclined\r\n     to accept these opinions.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Hereditary habits compared with instincts._\r\n\r\nThe chief characteristics of true instincts appear to be their\r\ninvariability and non-improvement during the mature age of the\r\nindividual animal: the absence of knowledge of the end, for which the\r\naction is performed, being associated, however, sometimes with a degree\r\nof reason; being subject to mistakes and being associated with certain\r\nstates of the body or times of the year or day. In most of these\r\nrespects there is a resemblance in the above detailed cases of the\r\nmental qualities acquired or modified during domestication. No doubt the\r\ninstincts of wild animals are more uniform than those habits or\r\nqualities modified or recently acquired under domestication, in the same\r\nmanner and from the same causes that the corporeal structure in this\r\nstate is less uniform than in beings in their natural conditions. I have\r\nseen a young pointer point as fixedly, the first day it was taken out,\r\nas any old dog; Magendie says this was the case with a retriever which\r\nhe himself reared: the tumbling of pigeons is not probably improved by\r\nage: we have seen that in the case above given that the young sheep\r\ninherited the migratory tendency to their particular birth-place the\r\nfirst time they lambed. This last fact offers an instance of a domestic\r\ninstinct being associated with a state of body; as do the\r\n\"transandantes\" sheep with a time of year. Ordinarily the acquired\r\ninstincts of domestic animals seem to require a certain degree of\r\neducation (as generally in pointers and retrievers) to be perfectly\r\ndeveloped: perhaps this holds good amongst wild animals in rather a\r\ngreater degree than is generally supposed; for instance, in the singing\r\nof birds, and in the knowledge of proper herbs in Ruminants. It seems\r\npretty clear that bees transmit knowledge from generation to generation.\r\nLord Brougham{278} insists strongly on ignorance of the end proposed\r\nbeing eminently characteristic of true instincts; and this appears to me\r\nto apply to many acquired hereditary habits; for instance, in the case\r\nof the young pointer alluded to before, which pointed so steadfastly the\r\nfirst day that we were obliged several times to carry him away{279}.\r\nThis puppy not only pointed at sheep, at large white stones, and at\r\nevery little bird, but likewise \"backed\" the other pointers: this young\r\ndog must have been as unconscious for what end he was pointing, namely\r\nto facilitate his master's killing game to eat, as is a butterfly which\r\nlays her eggs on a cabbage, that her caterpillars would eat the leaves.\r\nSo a horse that ambles instinctively, manifestly is ignorant that he\r\nperforms that peculiar pace for the ease of man; and if man had never\r\nexisted, he would never have ambled. The young pointer pointing at white\r\nstones appears to be as much a mistake of its acquired instinct, as in\r\nthe case of flesh-flies laying their eggs on certain flowers instead of\r\nputrifying meat. However true the ignorance of the end may generally be,\r\none sees that instincts are associated with some degree of reason; for\r\ninstance, in the case of the tailor-bird, who spins threads with which\r\nto make her nest <yet> will use artificial threads when she can procure\r\nthem{280}; so it has been known that an old pointer has broken his point\r\nand gone round a hedge to drive out a bird towards his master{281}.\r\n\r\n     {278} Lord Brougham's _Dissertations on Subjects of Science_, etc.,\r\n     1839, p. 27.\r\n\r\n     {279} This case is more briefly given in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p.\r\n     213, vi. p. 326. The simile of the butterfly occurs there also.\r\n\r\n     {280} \"A little dose, as Pierre Huber expresses it, of judgment or\r\n     reason, often comes into play.\" _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 208, vi. p.\r\n     320.\r\n\r\n     {281} In the margin is written \"Retriever killing one bird.\" This\r\n     refers to the cases given in the _Descent of Man_, 2nd Ed. (in 1\r\n     vol.) p. 78, of a retriever being puzzled how to deal with a\r\n     wounded and a dead bird, killed the former and carried both at\r\n     once. This was the only known instance of her wilfully injuring\r\n     game.\r\n\r\nThere is one other quite distinct method by which the instincts or\r\nhabits acquired under domestication may be compared with those given by\r\nnature, by a test of a fundamental kind; I mean the comparison of the\r\nmental powers of mongrels and hybrids. Now the instincts, or habits,\r\ntastes, and dispositions of one _breed_ of animals, when crossed with\r\nanother breed, for instance a shepherd-dog with a harrier, are blended\r\nand appear in the same curiously mixed degree, both in the first and\r\nsucceeding generations, exactly as happens when one _species_ is crossed\r\nwith another{282}. This would hardly be the case if there was any\r\nfundamental difference between the domestic and natural instinct{283};\r\nif the former were, to use a metaphorical expression, merely\r\nsuperficial.\r\n\r\n     {282} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 214, vi. p. 327.\r\n\r\n     {283} <Note in original.> Give some definition of instinct, or at\r\n     least give chief attributes. <In _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 207, vi. p.\r\n     319, Darwin refuses to define instinct.> The term instinct is often\r\n     used in <a> sense which implies no more than that the animal does\r\n     the action in question. Faculties and instincts may I think be\r\n     imperfectly separated. The mole has the faculty of scratching\r\n     burrows, and the instinct to apply it. The bird of passage has the\r\n     faculty of finding its way and the instinct to put it in action at\r\n     certain periods. It can hardly be said to have the faculty of\r\n     knowing the time, for it can possess no means, without indeed it be\r\n     some consciousness of passing sensations. Think over all habitual\r\n     actions and see whether faculties and instincts can be separated.\r\n     We have faculty of waking in the night, if an instinct prompted us\r\n     to do something at certain hour of night or day. Savages finding\r\n     their way. Wrangel's account--probably a faculty inexplicable by\r\n     the possessor. There are besides faculties \"_means_,\" as conversion\r\n     of larvæ into neuters and queens. I think all this generally\r\n     implied, anyhow useful. <This discussion, which does not occur in\r\n     the _Origin_, is a first draft of that which follows in the text,\r\n     p. 123.>\r\n\r\n\r\n_Variation in the mental attributes of wild animals._\r\n\r\nWith respect to the variation{284} of the mental powers of animals in a\r\nwild state, we know that there is a considerable difference in the\r\ndisposition of different individuals of the same species, as is\r\nrecognised by all those who have had the charge of animals in a\r\nmenagerie. With respect to the wildness of animals, that is fear\r\ndirected particularly against man, which appears to be as true an\r\ninstinct as the dread of a young mouse of a cat, we have excellent\r\nevidence that it is slowly acquired and becomes hereditary. It is also\r\ncertain that, in a natural state, individuals of the same species lose\r\nor do not practice their migratory instincts--as woodcocks in Madeira.\r\nWith respect to any variation in the more complicated instincts, it is\r\nobviously most difficult to detect, even more so than in the case of\r\ncorporeal structure, of which it has been admitted the variation is\r\nexceedingly small, and perhaps scarcely any in the majority of species\r\nat any one period. Yet, to take one excellent case of instinct, namely\r\nthe nests of birds, those who have paid most attention to the subject\r\nmaintain that not only certain individuals <? species> seem to be able\r\nto build very imperfectly, but that a difference in skill may not\r\nunfrequently be detected between individuals{285}. Certain birds,\r\nmoreover, adapt their nests to circumstances; the water-ouzel makes no\r\nvault when she builds under cover of a rock--the sparrow builds very\r\ndifferently when its nest is in a tree or in a hole, and the\r\ngolden-crested wren sometimes suspends its nest below and sometimes\r\nplaces it _on_ the branches of trees.\r\n\r\n     {284} A short discussion of a similar kind occurs in the _Origin_,\r\n     Ed. i. p. 211, vi. p. 324.\r\n\r\n     {285} This sentence agrees with the MS., but is clearly in need of\r\n     correction.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Principles of Selection applicable to instincts._\r\n\r\nAs the instincts of a species are fully as important to its preservation\r\nand multiplication as its corporeal structure, it is evident that if\r\nthere be the slightest congenital differences in the instincts and\r\nhabits, or if certain individuals during their lives are induced or\r\ncompelled to vary their habits, and if such differences are in the\r\nsmallest degree more favourable, under slightly modified external\r\nconditions, to their preservation, such individuals must in the long run\r\nhave a better _chance_ of being preserved and of multiplying{286}. If\r\nthis be admitted, a series of small changes may, as in the case of\r\ncorporeal structure, work great changes in the mental powers, habits and\r\ninstincts of any species.\r\n\r\n     {286} This corresponds to _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 212, vi. p. 325.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difficulties in the acquirement of complex instincts by Selection._\r\n\r\nEvery one will at first be inclined to explain (as I did for a long\r\ntime) that many of the more complicated and wonderful instincts could\r\nnot be acquired in the manner here supposed{287}. The Second Part of\r\nthis work is devoted to the general consideration of how far the general\r\neconomy of nature justifies or opposes the belief that related species\r\nand genera are descended from common stocks; but we may here consider\r\nwhether the instincts of animals offer such a _primâ facie_ case of\r\nimpossibility of gradual acquirement, as to justify the rejection of any\r\nsuch theory, however strongly it may be supported by other facts. I beg\r\nto repeat that I wish here to consider not the _probability_ but the\r\n_possibility_ of complicated instincts having been acquired by the slow\r\nand long-continued selection of very slight (either congenital or\r\nproduced by habit) modifications of foregoing simpler instincts; each\r\nmodification being as useful and necessary, to the species practising\r\nit, as the most complicated kind.\r\n\r\n     {287} This discussion is interesting in differing from the\r\n     corresponding section of the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 216, vi. p. 330,\r\n     to the end of the chapter. In the present Essay the subjects dealt\r\n     with are nest-making instincts, including the egg-hatching habit of\r\n     the Australian bush-turkey. The power of \"shamming death.\"\r\n     \"Faculty\" in relation to instinct. The instinct of lapse of time,\r\n     and of direction. Bees' cells very briefly given. Birds feeding\r\n     their young on food differing from their own natural food. In the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i., the cases discussed are the instinct of laying\r\n     eggs in other birds' nests; the slave-making instinct in ants; the\r\n     construction of the bee's comb, very fully discussed.\r\n\r\nFirst, to take the case of birds'-nests; of existing species (almost\r\ninfinitely few in comparison with the multitude which must have existed,\r\nsince the period of the new Red Sandstone of N. America, of whose habits\r\nwe must always remain ignorant) a tolerably perfect series could be made\r\nfrom eggs laid on the bare ground, to others with a few sticks just\r\nlaid round them, to a simple nest like the wood-pigeons, to others more\r\nand more complicated: now if, as is asserted, there occasionally exist\r\nslight differences in the building powers of an individual, and if,\r\nwhich is at least probable, that such differences would tend to be\r\ninherited, then we can see that it is at least _possible_ that the\r\nnidificatory instincts may have been acquired by the gradual selection,\r\nduring thousands and thousands of generations, of the eggs and young of\r\nthose individuals, whose nests were in some degree better adapted to the\r\npreservation of their young, under the then existing conditions. One of\r\nthe most surprising instincts on record is that of the Australian\r\nbush-turkey, whose eggs are hatched by the heat generated from a huge\r\npile of fermenting materials, which it heaps together; but here the\r\nhabits of an allied species show how this instinct _might possibly_ have\r\nbeen acquired. This second species inhabits a tropical district, where\r\nthe heat of the sun is sufficient to hatch its eggs; this bird, burying\r\nits eggs, apparently for concealment, under a lesser heap of rubbish,\r\nbut of a dry nature, so as not to ferment. Now suppose this bird to\r\nrange slowly into a climate which was cooler, and where leaves were more\r\nabundant, in that case, those individuals, which chanced to have their\r\ncollecting instinct strongest developed, would make a somewhat larger\r\npile, and the eggs, aided during some colder season, under the slightly\r\ncooler climate by the heat of incipient fermentation, would in the long\r\nrun be more freely hatched and would probably produce young ones with\r\nthe same more highly developed collecting tendencies; of these again,\r\nthose with the best developed powers would again tend to rear most\r\nyoung. Thus this strange instinct might _possibly_ be acquired, every\r\nindividual bird being as ignorant of the laws of fermentation, and the\r\nconsequent development of heat, as we know they must be.\r\n\r\nSecondly, to take the case of animals feigning death (as it is commonly\r\nexpressed) to escape danger. In the case of insects, a perfect series\r\ncan be shown, from some insects, which momentarily stand still, to\r\nothers which for a second slightly contract their legs, to others which\r\nwill remain immovably drawn together for a quarter of an hour, and may\r\nbe torn asunder or roasted at a slow fire, without evincing the smallest\r\nsign of sensation. No one will doubt that the length of time, during\r\nwhich each remains immovable, is well adapted to <favour the insect's>\r\nescape <from> the dangers to which it is most exposed, and few will deny\r\nthe _possibility_ of the change from one degree to another, by the means\r\nand at the rate already explained. Thinking it, however, wonderful\r\n(though not impossible) that the attitude of death should have been\r\nacquired by methods which imply no imitation, I compared several\r\nspecies, when feigning, as is said, death, with others of the same\r\nspecies really dead, and their attitudes were in no one case the same.\r\n\r\nThirdly, in considering many instincts it is useful to _endeavour_ to\r\nseparate the faculty{288} by which they perform it, and the mental power\r\nwhich urges to the performance, which is more properly called an\r\ninstinct. We have an instinct to eat, we have jaws &c. to give us the\r\nfaculty to do so. These faculties are often unknown to us: bats, with\r\ntheir eyes destroyed, can avoid strings suspended across a room, we know\r\nnot at present by what faculty they do this. Thus also, with migratory\r\nbirds, it is a wonderful instinct which urges them at certain times of\r\nthe year to direct their course in certain directions, but it is a\r\nfaculty by which they know the time and find their way. With respect to\r\ntime{289}, man without seeing the sun can judge to a certain extent of\r\nthe hour, as must those cattle which come down from the inland mountains\r\nto feed on sea-weed left bare at the changing hour of low-water{290}. A\r\nhawk (D'Orbigny) seems certainly to have acquired a knowledge of a\r\nperiod of every 21 days. In the cases already given of the sheep which\r\ntravelled to their birth-place to cast their lambs, and the sheep in\r\nSpain which know their time of march{291}, we may conjecture that the\r\ntendency to move is associated, we may then call it instinctively, with\r\nsome corporeal sensations. With respect to direction we can easily\r\nconceive how a tendency to travel in a certain course may possibly have\r\nbeen acquired, although we must remain ignorant how birds are able to\r\npreserve any direction whatever in a dark night over the wide ocean. I\r\nmay observe that the power of some savage races of mankind to find their\r\nway, although perhaps wholly different from the faculty of birds, is\r\nnearly as unintelligible to us. Bellinghausen, a skilful navigator,\r\ndescribes with the utmost wonder the manner in which some Esquimaux\r\nguided him to a certain point, by a course never straight, through newly\r\nformed hummocks of ice, on a thick foggy day, when he with a compass\r\nfound it impossible, from having no landmarks, and from their course\r\nbeing so extremely crooked, to preserve any sort of uniform direction:\r\nso it is with Australian savages in thick forests. In North and South\r\nAmerica many birds slowly travel northward and southward, urged on by\r\nthe food they find, as the seasons change; let them continue to do this,\r\ntill, as in the case of the sheep in Spain, it has become an urgent\r\ninstinctive desire, and they will gradually accelerate their journey.\r\nThey would cross narrow rivers, and if these were converted by\r\nsubsidence into narrow estuaries, and gradually during centuries to arms\r\nof the sea, still we may suppose their restless desire of travelling\r\nonwards would impel them to cross such an arm, even if it had become of\r\ngreat width beyond their span of vision. How they are able to preserve a\r\ncourse in any direction, I have said, is a faculty unknown to us. To\r\ngive another illustration of the means by which I conceive it _possible_\r\nthat the direction of migrations have been determined. Elk and reindeer\r\nin N. America annually cross, as if they could marvellously smell or see\r\nat the distance of a hundred miles, a wide tract of absolute desert, to\r\narrive at certain islands where there is a scanty supply of food; the\r\nchanges of temperature, which geology proclaims, render it probable that\r\nthis desert tract formerly supported some vegetation, and thus these\r\nquadrupeds might have been annually led on, till they reached the more\r\nfertile spots, and so acquired, like the sheep of Spain, their migratory\r\npowers.\r\n\r\n     {288} The distinction between _faculty_ and _instinct_ corresponds\r\n     in some degree to that between perception of a stimulus and a\r\n     specific reaction. I imagine that the author would have said that\r\n     the sensitiveness to light possessed by a plant is _faculty_, while\r\n     _instinct_ decides whether the plant curves to or from the source\r\n     of illumination.\r\n\r\n     {289} <Note in the original in an unknown handwriting.> At the time\r\n     when corn was pitched in the market instead of sold by sample, the\r\n     geese in the town fields of Newcastle <Staffordshire?> used to\r\n     know market day and come in to pick up the corn spilt.\r\n\r\n     {290} <Note in original.> Macculloch and others.\r\n\r\n     {291} I can find no reference to the _transandantes_ sheep in\r\n     Darwin's published work. He was possibly led to doubt the accuracy\r\n     of the statement on which he relied. For the case of the sheep\r\n     returning to their birth-place see p. 17, note 4.{Note 91}\r\n\r\nFourthly, with respect to the combs of the hive-bee{292}; here again we\r\nmust look to some faculty or means by which they make their hexagonal\r\ncells, without indeed we view these instincts as mere machines. At\r\npresent such a faculty is quite unknown: Mr Waterhouse supposes that\r\nseveral bees are led by their instinct to excavate a mass of wax to a\r\ncertain thinness, and that the result of this is that hexagons\r\nnecessarily remain. Whether this or some other theory be true, some such\r\nmeans they must possess. They abound, however, with true instincts,\r\nwhich are the most wonderful that are known. If we examine the little\r\nthat is known concerning the habits of other species of bees, we find\r\nmuch simpler instincts: the humble bee merely fills rude balls of wax\r\nwith honey and aggregates them together with little order in a rough\r\nnest of grass. If we knew the instinct of all the bees, which ever had\r\nexisted, it is not improbable that we should have instincts of every\r\ndegree of complexity, from actions as simple as a bird making a nest,\r\nand rearing her young, to the wonderful architecture and government of\r\nthe hive-bee; at least such is _possible_, which is all that I am here\r\nconsidering.\r\n\r\n     {292} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 224, vi. p. 342.\r\n\r\nFinally, I will briefly consider under the same point of view one other\r\nclass of instincts, which have often been advanced as truly wonderful,\r\nnamely parents bringing food to their young which they themselves\r\nneither like nor partake of{293};--for instance, the common sparrow, a\r\ngranivorous bird, feeding its young with caterpillars. We might of\r\ncourse look into the case still earlier, and seek how an instinct in the\r\nparent, of feeding its young at all, was first derived; but it is\r\nuseless to waste time in conjectures on a series of gradations from the\r\nyoung feeding themselves and being slightly and occasionally assisted in\r\ntheir search, to their entire food being brought to them. With respect\r\nto the parent bringing a different kind of food from its own kind, we\r\nmay suppose either that the remote stock, whence the sparrow and other\r\ncongenerous birds have descended, was insectivorous, and that its own\r\nhabits and structure have been changed, whilst its ancient instincts\r\nwith respect to its young have remained unchanged; or we may suppose\r\nthat the parents have been induced to vary slightly the food of their\r\nyoung, by a slight scarcity of the proper kind (or by the instincts of\r\nsome individuals not being so truly developed), and in this case those\r\nyoung which were most capable of surviving were necessarily most often\r\npreserved, and would themselves in time become parents, and would be\r\nsimilarly compelled to alter their food for their young. In the case of\r\nthose animals, the young of which feed themselves, changes in their\r\ninstincts for food, and in their structure, might be selected from\r\nslight variations, just as in mature animals. Again, where the food of\r\nthe young depends on where the mother places her eggs, as in the case of\r\nthe caterpillars of the cabbage-butterfly, we may suppose that the\r\nparent stock of the species deposited her eggs sometimes on one kind and\r\nsometimes on another of congenerous plants (as some species now do), and\r\nif the cabbage suited the caterpillars better than any other plant, the\r\ncaterpillars of those butterflies, which had chosen the cabbage, would\r\nbe most plentifully reared, and would produce butterflies more apt to\r\nlay their eggs on the cabbage than on the other congenerous plants.\r\n\r\n     {293} This is an expansion of an obscure passage in the Essay of\r\n     1842, p. 19.\r\n\r\nHowever vague and unphilosophical these conjectures may appear, they\r\nserve, I think, to show that one's first impulse utterly to reject any\r\ntheory whatever, implying a gradual acquirement of these instincts,\r\nwhich for ages have excited man's admiration, may at least be delayed.\r\nOnce grant that dispositions, tastes, actions or habits can be slightly\r\nmodified, either by slight congenital differences (we must suppose in\r\nthe brain) or by the force of external circumstances, and that such\r\nslight modifications can be rendered inheritable,--a proposition which\r\nno one can reject,--and it will be difficult to put any limit to the\r\ncomplexity and wonder of the tastes and habits which may _possibly_ be\r\nthus acquired.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Difficulties in the acquirement by Selection of complex corporeal\r\nstructures._\r\n\r\nAfter the past discussion it will perhaps be convenient here to consider\r\nwhether any particular corporeal organs, or the entire structure of any\r\nanimals, are so wonderful as to justify the rejection _primâ facie_ of\r\nour theory{294}. In the case of the eye, as with the more complicated\r\ninstincts, no doubt one's first impulse is to utterly reject every such\r\ntheory. But if the eye from its most complicated form can be shown to\r\ngraduate into an exceedingly simple state,--if selection can produce the\r\nsmallest change, and if such a series exists, then it is clear (for in\r\nthis work we have nothing to do with the first origin of organs in their\r\nsimplest forms{295}) that it may _possibly_ have been acquired by\r\ngradual selection of slight, but in each case, useful deviations{296}.\r\nEvery naturalist, when he meets with any new and singular organ, always\r\nexpects to find, and looks for, other and simpler modifications of it in\r\nother beings. In the case of the eye, we have a multitude of different\r\nforms, more or less simple, not graduating into each other, but\r\nseparated by sudden gaps or intervals; but we must recollect how\r\nincomparably greater would the multitude of visual structures be if we\r\nhad the eyes of every fossil which ever existed. We shall discuss the\r\nprobable vast proportion of the extinct to the recent in the succeeding\r\nPart. Notwithstanding the large series of existing forms, it is most\r\ndifficult even to conjecture by what intermediate stages very many\r\nsimple organs could possibly have graduated into complex ones: but it\r\nshould be here borne in mind, that a part having originally a wholly\r\ndifferent function, may on the theory of gradual selection be slowly\r\nworked into quite another use; the gradations of forms, from which\r\nnaturalists believe in the hypothetical metamorphosis of part of the ear\r\ninto the swimming bladder in fishes{297}, and in insects of legs into\r\njaws, show the manner in which this is possible. As under domestication,\r\nmodifications of structure take place, without any continued selection,\r\nwhich man finds very useful, or valuable for curiosity (as the hooked\r\ncalyx of the teazle, or the ruff round some pigeons' necks), so in a\r\nstate of nature some small modifications, apparently beautifully adapted\r\nto certain ends, may perhaps be produced from the accidents of the\r\nreproductive system, and be at once propagated without long-continued\r\nselection of small deviations towards that structure{298}. In\r\nconjecturing by what stages any complicated organ in a species may have\r\narrived at its present state, although we may look to the analogous\r\norgans in other existing species, we should do this merely to aid and\r\nguide our imaginations; for to know the real stages we must look only\r\nthrough one line of species, to one ancient stock, from which the\r\nspecies in question has descended. In considering the eye of a\r\nquadruped, for instance, though we may look at the eye of a molluscous\r\nanimal or of an insect, as a proof how simple an organ will serve some\r\nof the ends of vision; and at the eye of a fish as a nearer guide of the\r\nmanner of simplification; we must remember that it is a mere chance\r\n(assuming for a moment the truth of our theory) if any existing organic\r\nbeing has preserved any one organ, in exactly the same condition, as it\r\nexisted in the ancient species at remote geological periods.\r\n\r\n     {294} The difficulties discussed in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 171,\r\n     vi. p. 207, are the rarity of transitional varieties, the origin of\r\n     the tail of the giraffe; the otter-like polecat (_Mustela vison_);\r\n     the flying habit of the bat; the penguin and the logger-headed\r\n     duck; flying fish; the whale-like habit of the bear; the\r\n     woodpecker; diving petrels; the eye; the swimming bladder;\r\n     Cirripedes; neuter insects; electric organs.\r\n\r\n     Of these, the polecat, the bat, the woodpecker, the eye, the\r\n     swimming bladder are discussed in the present Essay, and in\r\n     addition some botanical problems.\r\n\r\n     {295} In the _Origin_, Ed. vi. p. 275, the author replies to\r\n     Mivart's criticisms (_Genesis of Species_, 1871), referring\r\n     especially to that writer's objection \"that natural selection is\r\n     incompetent to account for the incipient stages of useful\r\n     structures.\"\r\n\r\n     {296} <The following sentence seems to have been intended for\r\n     insertion here> \"and that each eye throughout the animal kingdom is\r\n     not only most useful, but _perfect_ for its possessor.\"\r\n\r\n     {297} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 190, vi. p. 230.\r\n\r\n     {298} This is one of the most definite statements in the present\r\n     Essay of the possible importance of _sports_ or what would now be\r\n     called _mutations_. As is well known the author afterwards doubted\r\n     whether species could arise in this way. See _Origin_, Ed. v. p.\r\n     103, vi. p. 110, also _Life and Letters_, vol. iii. p. 107.\r\n\r\nThe nature or condition of certain structures has been thought by some\r\nnaturalists to be of no use to the possessor{299}, but to have been\r\nformed wholly for the good of other species; thus certain fruit and\r\nseeds have been thought to have been made nutritious for certain\r\nanimals--numbers of insects, especially in their larval state, to exist\r\nfor the same end--certain fish to be bright coloured to aid certain\r\nbirds of prey in catching them, &c. Now could this be proved (which I am\r\nfar from admitting) the theory of natural selection would be quite\r\noverthrown; for it is evident that selection depending on the advantage\r\nover others of one individual with some slight deviation would never\r\nproduce a structure or quality profitable only to another species. No\r\ndoubt one being takes advantage of qualities in another, and may even\r\ncause its extermination; but this is far from proving that this quality\r\nwas produced for such an end. It may be advantageous to a plant to have\r\nits seeds attractive to animals, if one out of a hundred or a thousand\r\nescapes being digested, and thus aids dissemination: the bright colours\r\nof a fish may be of some advantage to it, or more probably may result\r\nfrom exposure to certain conditions in favourable haunts for food,\r\n_notwithstanding_ it becomes subject to be caught more easily by certain\r\nbirds.\r\n\r\n     {299} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 210, vi. p. 322, where the question\r\n     is discussed for the case of instincts with a proviso that the same\r\n     argument applies to structure. It is briefly stated in its general\r\n     bearing in _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 87, vi. p. 106.\r\n\r\nIf instead of looking, as above, at certain individual organs, in order\r\nto speculate on the stages by which their parts have been matured and\r\nselected, we consider an individual animal, we meet with the same or\r\ngreater difficulty, but which, I believe, as in the case of single\r\norgans, rests entirely on our ignorance. It may be asked by what\r\nintermediate forms could, for instance, a bat possibly have passed; but\r\nthe same question might have been asked with respect to the seal, if we\r\nhad not been familiar with the otter and other semi-aquatic carnivorous\r\nquadrupeds. But in the case of the bat, who can say what might have been\r\nthe habits of some parent form with less developed wings, when we now\r\nhave insectivorous opossums and herbivorous squirrels fitted for merely\r\ngliding through the air{300}. One species of bat is at present partly\r\naquatic in its habits{301}. Woodpeckers and tree-frogs are especially\r\nadapted, as their names express, for climbing trees; yet we have species\r\nof both inhabiting the open plains of La Plata, where a tree does not\r\nexist{302}. I might argue from this circumstance that a structure\r\neminently fitted for climbing trees might descend from forms inhabiting\r\na country where a tree did not exist. Notwithstanding these and a\r\nmultitude of other well-known facts, it has been maintained by several\r\nauthors that one species, for instance of the carnivorous order, could\r\nnot pass into another, for instance into an otter, because in its\r\ntransitional state its habits would not be adapted to any proper\r\nconditions of life; but the jaguar{303} is a thoroughly terrestrial\r\nquadruped in its structure, yet it takes freely to the water and catches\r\nmany fish; will it be said that it is _impossible_ that the conditions\r\nof its country might become such that the jaguar should be driven to\r\nfeed more on fish than they now do; and in that case is it impossible,\r\nis it not probable, that any the slightest deviation in its instincts,\r\nits form of body, in the width of its feet, and in the extension of the\r\nskin (which already unites the base of its toes) would give such\r\nindividuals a better _chance_ of surviving and propagating young with\r\nsimilar, barely perceptible (though thoroughly exercised),\r\ndeviations{304}? Who will say what could thus be effected in the course\r\nof ten thousand generations? Who can answer the same question with\r\nrespect to instincts? If no one can, the _possibility_ (for we are not\r\nin this chapter considering the _probability_) of simple organs or\r\norganic beings being modified by natural selection and the effects of\r\nexternal agencies into complicated ones ought not to be absolutely\r\nrejected.\r\n\r\n     {300} <Note in original.> No one will dispute that the gliding is\r\n     most useful, probably necessary for the species in question.\r\n\r\n     {301} <Note in original.> Is this the Galeopithecus?

In the MS. the chapters of Part II are numbered afresh,\r\n     the present being Ch. I of Pt. II. I have thought it best to call\r\n     it Ch. IV and there is evidence that Darwin had some thought of\r\n     doing the same. It corresponds to Ch. IX of _Origin_, Ed. i., Ch. X\r\n     in Ed. vi.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV\r\n\r\nON THE NUMBER OF INTERMEDIATE FORMS REQUIRED ON THE THEORY OF COMMON\r\nDESCENT; AND ON THEIR ABSENCE IN A FOSSIL STATE\r\n\r\n\r\nI must here premise that, according to the view ordinarily received, the\r\nmyriads of organisms, which have during past and present times peopled\r\nthis world, have been created by so many distinct acts of creation. It\r\nis impossible to reason concerning the will of the Creator, and\r\ntherefore, according to this view, we can see no cause why or why not\r\nthe individual organism should have been created on any fixed scheme.\r\nThat all the organisms of this world have been produced on a scheme is\r\ncertain from their general affinities; and if this scheme can be shown\r\nto be the same with that which would result from allied organic beings\r\ndescending from common stocks, it becomes highly improbable that they\r\nhave been separately created by individual acts of the will of a\r\nCreator. For as well might it be said that, although the planets move in\r\ncourses conformably to the law of gravity, yet we ought to attribute\r\nthe course of each planet to the individual act of the will of the\r\nCreator{306}. It is in every case more conformable with what we know of\r\nthe government of this earth, that the Creator should have imposed only\r\ngeneral laws. As long as no method was known by which races could become\r\nexquisitely adapted to various ends, whilst the existence of species was\r\nthought to be proved by the sterility{307} of their offspring, it was\r\nallowable to attribute each organism to an individual act of creation.\r\nBut in the two former chapters it has (I think) been shown that the\r\nproduction, under existing conditions, of exquisitely adapted species,\r\nis at least _possible_. Is there then any direct evidence in favour <of> or\r\nagainst this view? I believe that the geographical distribution of\r\norganic beings in past and present times, the kind of affinity linking\r\nthem together, their so-called \"metamorphic\" and \"abortive\" organs,\r\nappear in favour of this view. On the other hand, the imperfect evidence\r\nof the continuousness of the organic series, which, we shall immediately\r\nsee, is required on our theory, is against it; and is the most weighty\r\nobjection{308}. The evidence, however, even on this point, as far as it\r\ngoes, is favourable; and considering the imperfection of our knowledge,\r\nespecially with respect to past ages, it would be surprising if evidence\r\ndrawn from such sources were not also imperfect.\r\n\r\n     {306} In the Essay of 1842 the author uses astronomy in the same\r\n     manner as an illustration. In the _Origin_ this does not occur; the\r\n     reference to the action of secondary causes is more general, _e.g._\r\n     Ed. i. p. 488, vi. p. 668.\r\n\r\n     {307} It is interesting to find the argument from sterility given\r\n     so prominent a place. In a corresponding passage in the _Origin_,\r\n     Ed. i. p. 480, vi. p. 659, it is more summarily treated. The author\r\n     gives, as the chief bar to the acceptance of evolution, the fact\r\n     that \"we are always slow in admitting any great change of which we\r\n     do not see the intermediate steps\"; and goes on to quote Lyell on\r\n     geological action. It will be remembered that the question of\r\n     sterility remained a difficulty for Huxley.\r\n\r\n     {308} Similar statements occur in the Essay of 1842, p. 24, note 1,\r\n     and in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 299.\r\n\r\nAs I suppose that species have been formed in an analogous manner with\r\nthe varieties of the domesticated animals and plants, so must there have\r\nexisted intermediate forms between all the species of the same group,\r\nnot differing more than recognised varieties differ. It must not be\r\nsupposed necessary that there should have existed forms exactly\r\nintermediate in character between any two species of a genus, or even\r\nbetween any two varieties of a species; but it is necessary that there\r\nshould have existed every intermediate form between the one species or\r\nvariety of the common parent, and likewise between the second species or\r\nvariety, and this same common parent. Thus it does not necessarily\r\nfollow that there ever has existed <a> series of intermediate sub-varieties\r\n(differing no more than the occasional seedlings from the same\r\nseed-capsule,) between broccoli and common red cabbage; but it is\r\ncertain that there has existed, between broccoli and the wild parent\r\ncabbage, a series of such intermediate seedlings, and again between red\r\ncabbage and the wild parent cabbage: so that the broccoli and red\r\ncabbage are linked together, but not _necessarily_ by directly\r\nintermediate forms{309}. It is of course possible that there _may_ have\r\nbeen directly intermediate forms, for the broccoli may have long since\r\ndescended from a common red cabbage, and this from the wild cabbage. So\r\non my theory, it must have been with species of the same genus. Still\r\nmore must the supposition be avoided that there has necessarily ever\r\nexisted (though one _may_ have descended from <the> other) directly\r\nintermediate forms between any two genera or families--for instance\r\nbetween the genus _Sus_ and the Tapir{310}; although it is necessary\r\nthat intermediate forms (not differing more than the varieties of our\r\ndomestic animals) should have existed between Sus and some unknown\r\nparent form, and Tapir with this same parent form. The latter may have\r\ndiffered more from Sus and Tapir than these two genera now differ from\r\neach other. In this sense, according to our theory, there has been a\r\ngradual passage (the steps not being wider apart than our domestic\r\nvarieties) between the species of the same genus, between genera of the\r\nsame family, and between families of the same order, and so on, as far\r\nas facts, hereafter to be given, lead us; and the number of forms which\r\nmust have at former periods existed, thus to make good this passage\r\nbetween different species, genera, and families, must have been almost\r\ninfinitely great.\r\n\r\n     {309} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 280, vi. p. 414 he uses his\r\n     newly-acquired knowledge of pigeons to illustrate this point.\r\n\r\n     {310} Compare the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 281, vi. p. 414.\r\n\r\nWhat evidence{311} is there of a number of intermediate forms having\r\nexisted, making a passage in the above sense, between the species of the\r\nsame groups? Some naturalists have supposed that if every fossil which\r\nnow lies entombed, together with all existing species, were collected\r\ntogether, a perfect series in every great class would be formed.\r\nConsidering the enormous number of species requisite to effect this,\r\nespecially in the above sense of the forms not being _directly_\r\nintermediate between the existing species and genera, but only\r\nintermediate by being linked through a common but often widely different\r\nancestor, I think this supposition highly improbable. I am however far\r\nfrom underrating the probable number of fossilised species: no one who\r\nhas attended to the wonderful progress of palæontology during the last\r\nfew years will doubt that we as yet have found only an exceedingly small\r\nfraction of the species buried in the crust of the earth. Although the\r\nalmost infinitely numerous intermediate forms in no one class may have\r\nbeen preserved, it does not follow that they have not existed. The\r\nfossils which have been discovered, it is important to remark, do tend,\r\nthe little way they go, to make good the series; for as observed by\r\nBuckland they all fall into or between existing groups{312}. Moreover,\r\nthose that fall between our existing groups, fall in, according to the\r\nmanner required by our theory, for they do not directly connect two\r\nexisting species of different groups, but they connect the groups\r\nthemselves: thus the Pachydermata and Ruminantia are now separated by\r\nseveral characters, <for instance> the Pachydermata{313} have both a\r\ntibia and fibula, whilst Ruminantia have only a tibia; now the fossil\r\nMacrauchenia has a leg bone exactly intermediate in this respect, and\r\nlikewise has some other intermediate characters. But the Macrauchenia\r\ndoes not connect any one species of Pachydermata with some one other of\r\nRuminantia but it shows that these two groups have at one time been less\r\nwidely divided. So have fish and reptiles been at one time more closely\r\nconnected in some points than they now are. Generally in those groups in\r\nwhich there has been most change, the more ancient the fossil, if not\r\nidentical with recent, the more often it falls between existing groups,\r\nor into small existing groups which now lie between other large existing\r\ngroups. Cases like the foregoing, of which there are many, form steps,\r\nthough few and far between, in a series of the kind required by my\r\ntheory.\r\n\r\n     {311} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 301, vi. p. 440.\r\n\r\n     {312} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 329, vi. p. 471.\r\n\r\n     {313} The structure of the Pachyderm leg was a favourite with the\r\n     author. It is discussed in the Essay of 1842, p. 48. In the present\r\n     Essay the following sentence in the margin appears to refer to\r\n     Pachyderms and Ruminants: \"There can be no doubt, if we banish all\r\n     fossils, existing groups stand more separate.\" The following occurs\r\n     between the lines \"The earliest forms would be such as others could\r\n     radiate from.\"\r\n\r\nAs I have admitted the high improbability, that if every fossil were\r\ndisinterred, they would compose in each of the Divisions of Nature a\r\nperfect series of the kind required; consequently I freely admit, that\r\nif those geologists are in the right who consider the lowest known\r\nformation as contemporaneous with the first appearances of life{314}; or\r\nthe several formations as at all closely consecutive; or any one\r\nformation as containing a nearly perfect record of the organisms which\r\nexisted during the whole period of its deposition in that quarter of the\r\nglobe;--if such propositions are to be accepted, my theory must be\r\nabandoned.\r\n\r\n     {314} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 307, vi. p. 448.\r\n\r\nIf the Palæozoic system is really contemporaneous with the first\r\nappearance of life, my theory must be abandoned, both inasmuch as it\r\nlimits _from shortness of time_ the total number of forms which can have\r\nexisted on this world, and because the organisms, as fish, mollusca{315}\r\nand star-fish found in its lower beds, cannot be considered as the\r\nparent forms of all the successive species in these classes. But no one\r\nhas yet overturned the arguments of Hutton and Lyell, that the lowest\r\nformations known to us are only those which have escaped being\r\nmetamorphosed <illegible>; if we argued from some considerable districts,\r\nwe might have supposed that even the Cretaceous system was that in which\r\nlife first appeared. From the number of distant points, however, in\r\nwhich the Silurian system has been found to be the lowest, and not\r\nalways metamorphosed, there are some objections to Hutton's and Lyell's\r\nview; but we must not forget that the now existing land forms only 1/5\r\npart of the superficies of the globe, and that this fraction is only\r\nimperfectly known. With respect to the fewness of the organisms found in\r\nthe Silurian and other Palæozoic formations, there is less difficulty,\r\ninasmuch as (besides their gradual obliteration) we can expect\r\nformations of this vast antiquity to escape entire denudation, only when\r\nthey have been accumulated over a wide area, and have been subsequently\r\nprotected by vast superimposed deposits: now this could generally only\r\nhold good with deposits accumulating in a wide and deep ocean, and\r\ntherefore unfavourable to the presence of many living things. A mere\r\nnarrow and not very thick strip of matter, deposited along a coast where\r\norganisms most abound, would have no chance of escaping denudation and\r\nbeing preserved to the present time from such immensely distant\r\nages{316}.\r\n\r\n     {315} <Pencil insertion by the author.> The parent-forms of Mollusca\r\n     would probably differ greatly from all recent,--it is not directly\r\n     that any one division of Mollusca would descend from first time\r\n     unaltered, whilst others had become metamorphosed from it.\r\n\r\n     {316} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 291, vi. p. 426.\r\n\r\nIf the several known formations are at all nearly consecutive in time,\r\nand preserve a fair record of the organisms which have existed, my\r\ntheory must be abandoned. But when we consider the great changes in\r\nmineralogical nature and texture between successive formations, what\r\nvast and entire changes in the geography of the surrounding countries\r\nmust generally have been effected, thus wholly to have changed the\r\nnature of the deposits on the same area. What time such changes must\r\nhave required! Moreover how often has it not been found, that between\r\ntwo conformable and apparently immediately successive deposits a vast\r\npile of water-worn matter is interpolated in an adjoining district. We\r\nhave no means of conjecturing in many cases how long a period{317} has\r\nelapsed between successive formations, for the species are often wholly\r\ndifferent: as remarked by Lyell, in some cases probably as long a period\r\nhas elapsed between two formations as the whole Tertiary system, itself\r\nbroken by wide gaps.\r\n\r\n     {317} <Note in original.> Reflect on coming in of the Chalk,\r\n     extending from Iceland to the Crimea.\r\n\r\nConsult the writings of any one who has particularly attended to any one\r\nstage in the Tertiary system (and indeed of every system) and see how\r\ndeeply impressed he is with the time required for its accumulation{318}.\r\nReflect on the years elapsed in many cases, since the latest beds\r\ncontaining only living species have been formed;--see what Jordan Smith\r\nsays of the 20,000 years since the last bed, which is above the boulder\r\nformation in Scotland, has been upraised; or of the far longer period\r\nsince the recent beds of Sweden have been upraised 400 feet, what an\r\nenormous period the boulder formation must have required, and yet how\r\ninsignificant are the records (although there has been plenty of\r\nelevation to bring up submarine deposits) of the shells, which we know\r\nexisted at that time. Think, then, over the entire length of the\r\nTertiary epoch, and think over the probable length of the intervals,\r\nseparating the Secondary deposits. Of these deposits, moreover, those\r\nconsisting of sand and pebbles have seldom been favourable, either to\r\nthe embedment or to the preservation of fossils{319}.\r\n\r\n     {318} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 282, vi. p. 416.\r\n\r\n     {319} _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 288, 300, vi. pp. 422, 438.\r\n\r\nNor can it be admitted as probable that any one Secondary formation\r\ncontains a fair record even of those organisms which are most easily\r\npreserved, namely hard marine bodies. In how many cases have we not\r\ncertain evidence that between the deposition of apparently closely\r\nconsecutive beds, the lower one existed for an unknown time as land,\r\ncovered with trees. Some of the Secondary formations which contain most\r\nmarine remains appear to have been formed in a wide and not deep sea,\r\nand therefore only those marine animals which live in such situations\r\nwould be preserved{320}. In all cases, on indented rocky coasts, or any\r\nother coast, where sediment is not accumulating, although often highly\r\nfavourable to marine animals, none can be embedded: where pure sand and\r\npebbles are accumulating few or none will be preserved. I may here\r\ninstance the great western line of the S. American coast{321}, tenanted\r\nby many peculiar animals, of which none probably will be preserved to a\r\ndistant epoch. From these causes, and especially from such deposits as\r\nare formed along a line of coast, steep above and below water, being\r\nnecessarily of little width, and therefore more likely to be\r\nsubsequently denuded and worn away, we can see why it is improbable that\r\nour Secondary deposits contain a fair record of the Marine Fauna of any\r\none period. The East Indian Archipelago offers an area, as large as most\r\nof our Secondary deposits, in which there are wide and shallow seas,\r\nteeming with marine animals, and in which sediment is accumulating; now\r\nsupposing that all the hard marine animals, or rather those having hard\r\nparts to preserve, were preserved to a future age, excepting those which\r\nlived on rocky shores where no sediment or only sand and gravel were\r\naccumulating, and excepting those embedded along the steeper coasts,\r\nwhere only a narrow fringe of sediment was accumulating, supposing all\r\nthis, how poor a notion would a person at a future age have of the\r\nMarine Fauna of the present day. Lyell{322} has compared the geological\r\nseries to a work of which only the few latter but not consecutive\r\nchapters have been preserved; and out of which, it may be added, very\r\nmany leaves have been torn, the remaining ones only illustrating a\r\nscanty portion of the Fauna of each period. On this view, the records\r\nof anteceding ages confirm my theory; on any other they destroy it.\r\n\r\n     {320} <Note in original.> Neither highest or lowest fish (_i.e._\r\n     Myxina <?> or Lepidosiren) could be preserved in intelligible\r\n     condition in fossils.\r\n\r\n     {321} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 290, vi. p. 425.\r\n\r\n     {322} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 310, vi. p. 452 for Lyell's metaphor.\r\n     I am indebted to Prof. Judd for pointing out that Darwin's version\r\n     of the metaphor is founded on the first edition of Lyell's\r\n     _Principles_, vol. I. and vol. III.; see the Essay of 1842, p. 27.\r\n\r\nFinally, if we narrow the question into, why do we not find in some\r\ninstances every intermediate form between any two species? the answer\r\nmay well be that the average duration of each specific form (as we have\r\ngood reason to believe) is immense in years, and that the transition\r\ncould, according to my theory, be effected only by numberless small\r\ngradations; and therefore that we should require for this end a most\r\nperfect record, which the foregoing reasoning teaches us not to expect.\r\nIt might be thought that in a vertical section of great thickness in the\r\nsame formation some of the species ought to be found to vary in the\r\nupper and lower parts{323}, but it may be doubted whether any formation\r\nhas gone on accumulating without any break for a period as long as the\r\nduration of a species; and if it had done so, we should require a series\r\nof specimens from every part. How rare must be the chance of sediment\r\naccumulating for some 20 or 30 thousand years on the same spot{324},\r\nwith the bottom subsiding, so that a proper depth might be preserved for\r\nany one species to continue living: what an amount of subsidence would\r\nbe thus required, and this subsidence must not destroy the source whence\r\nthe sediment continued to be derived. In the case of terrestrial\r\nanimals, what chance is there when the present time is become a\r\npleistocene formation (at an earlier period than this, sufficient\r\nelevation to expose marine beds could not be expected), what chance is\r\nthere that future geologists will make out the innumerable transitional\r\nsub-varieties, through which the short-horned and long-horned cattle\r\n(so different in shape of body) have been derived from the same parent\r\nstock{325}? Yet this transition has been effected in _the same country_,\r\nand in a far _shorter time_, than would be probable in a wild state,\r\nboth contingencies highly favourable for the future hypothetical\r\ngeologists being enabled to trace the variation.\r\n\r\n     {323} See _More Letters_, vol. I. pp. 344-7, for Darwin's interest\r\n     in the celebrated observations of Hilgendorf and Hyatt.\r\n\r\n     {324} This corresponds partly to _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 294, vi. p.\r\n     431.\r\n\r\n     {325} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 299, vi. p. 437.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V\r\n\r\nGRADUAL APPEARANCE AND DISAPPEARANCE OF SPECIES{326}\r\n\r\n     {326} This chapter corresponds to ch. X of _Origin_, Ed. i., vi.\r\n     ch. XI, \"On the geological succession of organic beings.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the Tertiary system, in the last uplifted beds, we find all the\r\nspecies recent and living in the immediate vicinity; in rather older\r\nbeds we find only recent species, but some not living in the immediate\r\nvicinity{327}; we then find beds with two or three or a few more extinct\r\nor very rare species; then considerably more extinct species, but with\r\ngaps in the regular increase; and finally we have beds with only two or\r\nthree or not one living species. Most geologists believe that the gaps\r\nin the percentage, that is the sudden increments, in the number of the\r\nextinct species in the stages of the Tertiary system are due to the\r\nimperfection of the geological record. Hence we are led to believe that\r\nthe species in the Tertiary system have been gradually introduced; and\r\nfrom analogy to carry on the same view to the Secondary formations. In\r\nthese latter, however, entire groups of species generally come in\r\nabruptly; but this would naturally result, if, as argued in the\r\nforegoing chapter, these Secondary deposits are separated by wide\r\nepochs. Moreover it is important to observe that, with our increase of\r\nknowledge, the gaps between the older formations become fewer and\r\nsmaller; geologists of a few years standing remember how beautifully\r\nhas the Devonian system{328} come in between the Carboniferous and\r\nSilurian formations. I need hardly observe that the slow and gradual\r\nappearance of new forms follows from our theory, for to form a new\r\nspecies, an old one must not only be plastic in its organization,\r\nbecoming so probably from changes in the conditions of its existence,\r\nbut a place in the natural economy of the district must [be made,] come\r\nto exist, for the selection of some new modification of its structure,\r\nbetter fitted to the surrounding conditions than are the other\r\nindividuals of the same or other species{329}.\r\n\r\n     {327} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 312, vi. p. 453.\r\n\r\n     {328} In the margin the author has written \"Lonsdale.\" This refers\r\n     to W. Lonsdale's paper \"Notes on the age of the Limestone of South\r\n     Devonshire,\" _Geolog. Soc. Trans._, Series 2, vol. V. 1840, p. 721.\r\n     According to Mr H. B. Woodward (_History of the Geological Society\r\n     of London_, 1907, p. 107) \"Lonsdale's 'important and original\r\n     suggestion of the existence of an intermediary type of Palæozoic\r\n     fossils, since called Devonian,' led to a change which was then\r\n     'the greatest ever made at one time in the classification of our\r\n     English formations'.\" Mr Woodward's quotations are from Murchison\r\n     and Buckland.\r\n\r\n     {329} <Note in original.> Better begin with this. If species really,\r\n     after catastrophes, created in showers over world, my theory false.\r\n     <In the above passage the author is obviously close to his theory of\r\n     divergence.>\r\n\r\nIn the Tertiary system the same facts, which make us admit as probable\r\nthat new species have slowly appeared, lead to the admission that old\r\nones have slowly disappeared, not several together, but one after\r\nanother; and by analogy one is induced to extend this belief to the\r\nSecondary and Palæozoic epochs. In some cases, as the subsidence of a\r\nflat country, or the breaking or the joining of an isthmus, and the\r\nsudden inroad of many new and destructive species, extinction might be\r\nlocally sudden. The view entertained by many geologists, that each fauna\r\nof each Secondary epoch has been suddenly destroyed over the whole\r\nworld, so that no succession could be left for the production of new\r\nforms, is subversive of my theory, but I see no grounds whatever to\r\nadmit such a view. On the contrary, the law, which has been made out,\r\nwith reference to distinct epochs, by independent observers, namely,\r\nthat the wider the geographical range of a species the longer is its\r\nduration in time, seems entirely opposed to any universal\r\nextermination{330}. The fact of species of mammiferous animals and fish\r\nbeing renewed at a quicker rate than mollusca, though both aquatic; and\r\nof these the terrestrial genera being renewed quicker than the marine;\r\nand the marine mollusca being again renewed quicker than the Infusorial\r\nanimalcula, all seem to show that the extinction and renewal of species\r\ndoes not depend on general catastrophes, but on the particular relations\r\nof the several classes to the conditions to which they are exposed{331}.\r\n\r\n     {330} Opposite to this passage the author has written \"d'Archiac,\r\n     Forbes, Lyell.\"\r\n\r\n     {331} This passage, for which the author gives as authorities the\r\n     names of Lyell, Forbes and Ehrenberg, corresponds in part to the\r\n     discussion beginning on p. 313 of _Origin_, Ed. i., vi. p. 454.\r\n\r\nSome authors seem to consider the fact of a few species having\r\nsurvived{332} amidst a number of extinct forms (as is the case with a\r\ntortoise and a crocodile out of the vast number of extinct sub-Himalayan\r\nfossils) as strongly opposed to the view of species being mutable. No\r\ndoubt this would be the case, if it were presupposed with Lamarck that\r\nthere was some inherent tendency to change and development in all\r\nspecies, for which supposition I see no evidence. As we see some species\r\nat present adapted to a wide range of conditions, so we may suppose that\r\nsuch species would survive unchanged and unexterminated for a long time;\r\ntime generally being from geological causes a correlative of changing\r\nconditions. How at present one species becomes adapted to a wide range,\r\nand another species to a restricted range of conditions, is of difficult\r\nexplanation.\r\n\r\n     {332} The author gives Falconer as his authority: see _Origin_, Ed.\r\n     i. p. 313, vi. p. 454.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Extinction of species._\r\n\r\nThe extinction of the larger quadrupeds, of which we imagine we better\r\nknow the conditions of existence, has been thought little less wonderful\r\nthan the appearance of new species; and has, I think, chiefly led to the\r\nbelief of universal catastrophes. When considering the wonderful\r\ndisappearance within a late period, whilst recent shells were living, of\r\nthe numerous great and small mammifers of S. America, one is strongly\r\ninduced to join with the catastrophists. I believe, however, that very\r\nerroneous views are held on this subject. As far as is historically\r\nknown, the disappearance of species from any one country has been\r\nslow--the species becoming rarer and rarer, locally extinct, and finally\r\nlost{333}. It may be objected that this has been effected by man's\r\ndirect agency, or by his indirect agency in altering the state of the\r\ncountry; in this latter case, however, it would be difficult to draw any\r\njust distinction between his agency and natural agencies. But we now\r\nknow in the later Tertiary deposits, that shells become rarer and rarer\r\nin the successive beds, and finally disappear: it has happened, also,\r\nthat shells common in a fossil state, and thought to have been extinct,\r\nhave been found to be still living species, but very _rare_ ones{334}.\r\nIf the rule is that organisms become extinct by becoming rarer and\r\nrarer, we ought not to view their extinction, even in the case of the\r\nlarger quadrupeds, as anything wonderful and out of the common course of\r\nevents. For no naturalist thinks it wonderful that one species of a\r\ngenus should be rare and another abundant, notwithstanding he be quite\r\nincapable of explaining the causes of the comparative rareness{335}. Why\r\nis one species of willow-wren or hawk or woodpecker common in England,\r\nand another extremely rare: why at the Cape of Good Hope is one species\r\nof rhinoceros or antelope far more abundant than other species? Why\r\nagain is the same species much more abundant in one district of a\r\ncountry than in another district? No doubt there are in each case good\r\ncauses: but they are unknown and unperceived by us. May we not then\r\nsafely infer that as certain causes are acting _unperceived_ around us,\r\nand are making one species to be common and another exceedingly rare,\r\nthat they might equally well cause the final extinction of some species\r\nwithout being perceived by us? We should always bear in mind that there\r\nis a recurrent struggle for life in every organism, and that in every\r\ncountry a destroying agency is always counteracting the geometrical\r\ntendency to increase in every species; and yet without our being able to\r\ntell with certainty at what period of life, or at what period of the\r\nyear, the destruction falls the heaviest. Ought we then to expect to\r\ntrace the steps by which this destroying power, always at work and\r\nscarcely perceived by us, becomes increased, and yet if it continues to\r\nincrease ever so slowly (without the fertility of the species in\r\nquestion be likewise increased) the average number of the individuals of\r\nthat species must decrease, and become finally lost. I may give a single\r\ninstance of a check causing local extermination which might long have\r\nescaped discovery{336}; the horse, though swarming in a wild state in La\r\nPlata, and likewise under apparently the most unfavourable conditions in\r\nthe scorched and alternately flooded plains of Caraccas, will not in a\r\nwild state extend beyond a certain degree of latitude into the\r\nintermediate country of Paraguay; this is owing to a certain fly\r\ndepositing its eggs on the navels of the foals: as, however, man with a\r\n_little_ care can rear horses in a tame state _abundantly_ in Paraguay,\r\nthe problem of its extinction is probably complicated by the greater\r\nexposure of the wild horse to occasional famine from the droughts, to\r\nthe attacks of the jaguar and other such evils. In the Falkland Islands\r\nthe check to the _increase_ of the wild horse is said to be loss of the\r\nsucking foals{337}, from the stallions compelling the mares to travel\r\nacross bogs and rocks in search of food: if the pasture on these islands\r\ndecreased a little, the horse, perhaps, would cease to exist in a wild\r\nstate, not from the absolute want of food, but from the impatience of\r\nthe stallions urging the mares to travel whilst the foals were too\r\nyoung.\r\n\r\n     {333} This corresponds approximately to _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 317,\r\n     vi. p. 458.\r\n\r\n     {334} The case of _Trigonia_, a great Secondary genus of shells\r\n     surviving in a single species in the Australian seas, is given as\r\n     an example in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 321, vi. p. 463.\r\n\r\n     {335} This point, on which the author laid much stress, is\r\n     discussed in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 319, vi. p. 461.\r\n\r\n     {336} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 72, vi. p. 89.\r\n\r\n     {337} This case does not occur in the _Origin_, Ed.\r\n\r\nFrom our more intimate acquaintance with domestic animals, we cannot\r\nconceive their extinction without some glaring agency; we forget that\r\nthey would undoubtedly in a state of nature (where other animals are\r\nready to fill up their place) be acted on in some part of their lives by\r\na destroying agency, keeping their numbers on an average constant. If\r\nthe common ox was known only as a wild S. African species, we should\r\nfeel no surprise at hearing that it was a very rare species; and this\r\nrarity would be a stage towards its extinction. Even in man, so\r\ninfinitely better known than any other inhabitant of this world, how\r\nimpossible it has been found, without statistical calculations, to judge\r\nof the proportions of births and deaths, of the duration of life, and of\r\nthe increase and decrease of population; and still less of the causes of\r\nsuch changes: and yet, as has so often been repeated, decrease in\r\nnumbers or rarity seems to be the high-road to extinction. To marvel at\r\nthe extermination of a species appears to me to be the same thing as to\r\nknow that illness is the road to death,--to look at illness as an\r\nordinary event, nevertheless to conclude, when the sick man dies, that\r\nhis death has been caused by some unknown and violent agency{338}.\r\n\r\n     {338} An almost identical sentence occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     p. 320, vi. p. 462.\r\n\r\nIn a future part of this work we shall show that, as a general rule,\r\ngroups of allied species{339} gradually appear and disappear, one after\r\nthe other, on the face of the earth, like the individuals of the same\r\nspecies: and we shall then endeavour to show the probable cause of this\r\nremarkable fact.\r\n\r\n     {339} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 316, vi. p. 457.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI\r\n\r\nON THE GEOGRAPHICAL DISTRIBUTION OF ORGANIC BEINGS IN PAST AND PRESENT\r\nTIMES\r\n\r\n\r\nFor convenience sake I shall divide this chapter into three\r\nsections{340}. In the first place I shall endeavour to state the laws of\r\nthe distribution of existing beings, as far as our present object is\r\nconcerned; in the second, that of extinct; and in the third section I\r\nshall consider how far these laws accord with the theory of allied\r\nspecies having a common descent.\r\n\r\n     {340} Chapters XI and XII in the _Origin_, Ed. i., vi. chs. XII and\r\n     XIII (\"On geographical distribution\") show signs of having been\r\n     originally one, in the fact that one summary serves for both. The\r\n     geological element is not separately treated there, nor is there a\r\n     separate section on \"how far these laws accord with the theory,\r\n     &c.\"\r\n\r\n     In the MS. the author has here written in the margin \"If same\r\n     species appear at two spot at once, fatal to my theory.\" See\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 352, vi. p. 499\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION FIRST.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distribution of the inhabitants in the different continents._\r\n\r\nIn the following discussion I shall chiefly refer to terrestrial\r\nmammifers, inasmuch as they are better known; their differences in\r\ndifferent countries, strongly marked; and especially as the necessary\r\nmeans of their transport are more evident, and confusion, from the\r\naccidental conveyance by man of a species from one district to another\r\ndistrict, is less likely to arise. It is known that all mammifers (as\r\nwell as all other organisms) are united in one great system; but that\r\nthe different species, genera, or families of the same order inhabit\r\ndifferent quarters of the globe. If we divide the land{341} into two\r\ndivisions, according to the amount of difference, and disregarding the\r\nnumbers of the terrestrial mammifers inhabiting them, we shall have\r\nfirst Australia including New Guinea; and secondly the rest of the\r\nworld: if we make a three-fold division, we shall have Australia, S.\r\nAmerica, and the rest of the world; I must observe that North America is\r\nin some respects neutral land, from possessing some S. American forms,\r\nbut I believe it is more closely allied (as it certainly is in its\r\nbirds, plants and shells) with Europe. If our division had been\r\nfour-fold, we should have had Australia, S. America, Madagascar (though\r\ninhabited by few mammifers) and the remaining land: if five-fold,\r\nAfrica, especially the southern eastern parts, would have to be\r\nseparated from the remainder of the world. These differences in the\r\nmammiferous inhabitants of the several main divisions of the globe\r\ncannot, it is well known, be explained by corresponding differences in\r\ntheir conditions{342}; how similar are parts of tropical America and\r\nAfrica; and accordingly we find some _analogous_ resemblances,--thus\r\nboth have monkeys, both large feline animals, both large Lepidoptera,\r\nand large dung-feeding beetles; both have palms and epiphytes; and yet\r\nthe essential difference between their productions is as great as\r\nbetween those of the arid plains of the Cape of Good Hope and the\r\ngrass-covered savannahs of La Plata{343}. Consider the distribution of\r\nthe Marsupialia, which are eminently characteristic of Australia, and in\r\na lesser degree of S. America; when we reflect that animals of this\r\ndivision, feeding both on animal and vegetable matter, frequent the dry\r\nopen or wooded plains and mountains of Australia, the humid impenetrable\r\nforests of New Guinea and Brazil; the dry rocky mountains of Chile, and\r\nthe grassy plains of Banda Oriental, we must look to some other cause,\r\nthan the nature of the country, for their absence in Africa and other\r\nquarters of the world.\r\n\r\n     {341} This division of the land into regions does not occur in the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n\r\n     {342} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 346, vi. p. 493.\r\n\r\n     {343} Opposite this passage is written \"_not botanically_,\" in Sir\r\n     J. D. Hooker's hand. The word _palms_ is underlined three times and\r\n     followed by three exclamation marks. An explanatory note is added\r\n     in the margin \"singular paucity of palms and epiphytes in Trop.\r\n     Africa compared with Trop. America and Ind. Or.\" <=East Indies>.\r\n\r\nFurthermore it may be observed that _all_ the organisms inhabiting any\r\ncountry are not perfectly adapted to it{344}; I mean by not being\r\nperfectly adapted, only that some few other organisms can generally be\r\nfound better adapted to the country than some of the aborigines. We must\r\nadmit this when we consider the enormous number of horses and cattle\r\nwhich have run wild during the three last centuries in the uninhabited\r\nparts of St Domingo, Cuba, and S. America; for these animals must have\r\nsupplanted some aboriginal ones. I might also adduce the same fact in\r\nAustralia, but perhaps it will be objected that 30 or 40 years has not\r\nbeen a sufficient period to test this power of struggling <with> and\r\novercoming the aborigines. We know the European mouse is driving before\r\nit that of New Zealand, like the Norway rat has driven before it the old\r\nEnglish species in England. Scarcely an island can be named, where\r\ncasually introduced plants have not supplanted some of the native\r\nspecies: in La Plata the Cardoon covers square leagues of country on\r\nwhich some S. American plants must once have grown: the commonest weed\r\nover the whole of India is an introduced Mexican poppy. The geologist\r\nwho knows that slow changes are in progress, replacing land and water,\r\nwill easily perceive that even if all the organisms of any country had\r\noriginally been the best adapted to it, this could hardly continue so\r\nduring succeeding ages without either extermination, or changes, first\r\nin the relative proportional numbers of the inhabitants of the country,\r\nand finally in their constitutions and structure.\r\n\r\n     {344} This partly corresponds to _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 337, vi. p.\r\n     483.\r\n\r\nInspection of a map of the world at once shows that the five divisions,\r\nseparated according to the greatest amount of difference in the\r\nmammifers inhabiting them, are likewise those most widely separated from\r\neach other by barriers{345} which mammifers cannot pass: thus Australia\r\nis separated from New Guinea and some small adjoining islets only by a\r\nnarrow and shallow strait; whereas New Guinea and its adjoining islets\r\nare cut off from the other East Indian islands by deep water. These\r\nlatter islands, I may remark, which fall into the great Asiatic group,\r\nare separated from each other and the continent only by shallow water;\r\nand where this is the case we may suppose, from geological oscillations\r\nof level, that generally there has been recent union. South America,\r\nincluding the southern part of Mexico, is cut off from North America by\r\nthe West Indies, and the great table-land of Mexico, except by a mere\r\nfringe of tropical forests along the coast: it is owing, perhaps, to\r\nthis fringe that N. America possesses some S. American forms. Madagascar\r\nis entirely isolated. Africa is also to a great extent isolated,\r\nalthough it approaches, by many promontories and by lines of shallower\r\nsea, to Europe and Asia: southern Africa, which is the most distinct in\r\nits mammiferous inhabitants, is separated from the northern portion by\r\nthe Great Sahara Desert and the table-land of Abyssinia. That the\r\ndistribution of organisms is related to barriers, stopping their\r\nprogress, we clearly see by comparing the distribution of marine and\r\nterrestrial productions. The marine animals being different on the two\r\nsides of land tenanted by the same terrestrial animals, thus the shells\r\nare wholly different on the opposite sides of the temperate parts of\r\nSouth America{346}, as they are (?) in the Red Sea and the\r\nMediterranean. We can at once perceive that the destruction of a barrier\r\nwould permit two geographical groups of organisms to fuse and blend into\r\none. But the original cause of groups being different on opposite sides\r\nof a barrier can only be understood on the hypothesis of each organism\r\nhaving been created or produced on one spot or area, and afterwards\r\nmigrating as widely as its means of transport and subsistence permitted\r\nit.\r\n\r\n     {345} On the general importance of barriers, see _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     p. 347, vi. p. 494.\r\n\r\n     {346} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 348, vi. p. 495.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Relation of range in genera and species._\r\n\r\nIt is generally{347} found, that where a genus or group ranges over\r\nnearly the entire world, many of the species composing the group have\r\nwide ranges: on the other hand, where a group is restricted to any one\r\ncountry, the species composing it generally have restricted ranges in\r\nthat country{348}. Thus among mammifers the feline and canine genera are\r\nwidely distributed, and many of the individual species have enormous\r\nranges [the genus Mus I believe, however, is a strong exception to the\r\nrule]. Mr Gould informs me that the rule holds with birds, as in the\r\nowl genus, which is mundane, and many of the species range widely. The\r\nrule holds also with land and fresh-water mollusca, with butterflies and\r\nvery generally with plants. As instances of the converse rule, I may\r\ngive that division of the monkeys which is confined to S. America, and\r\namongst plants, the Cacti, confined to the same continent, the species\r\nof both of which have generally narrow ranges. On the ordinary theory of\r\nthe separate creation of each species, the cause of these relations is\r\nnot obvious; we can see no reason, because many allied species have been\r\ncreated in the several main divisions of the world, that several of\r\nthese species should have wide ranges; and on the other hand, that\r\nspecies of the same group should have narrow ranges if all have been\r\ncreated in one main division of the world. As the result of such and\r\nprobably many other unknown relations, it is found that, even in the\r\nsame great classes of beings, the different divisions of the world are\r\ncharacterised by either merely different species, or genera, or even\r\nfamilies: thus in cats, mice, foxes, S. America differs from Asia and\r\nAfrica only in species; in her pigs, camels and monkeys the difference\r\nis generic or greater. Again, whilst southern Africa and Australia\r\ndiffer more widely in their mammalia than do Africa and S. America, they\r\nare more closely (though indeed very distantly) allied in their plants.\r\n\r\n     {347} <Note in original.> The same laws seem to govern distribution\r\n     of species and genera, and individuals in time and space. <See\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 350, vi. p. 497, also a passage in the last\r\n     chapter, p. 146.>\r\n\r\n     {348} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 404, vi. p. 559.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Distribution of the inhabitants in the same continent._\r\n\r\nIf we now look at the distribution of the organisms in any one of the\r\nabove main divisions of the world, we shall find it split up into many\r\nregions, with all or nearly all their species distinct, but yet\r\npartaking of one common character. This similarity of type in the\r\nsubdivisions of a great region is equally well-known with the\r\ndissimilarity of the inhabitants of the several great regions; but it\r\nhas been less often insisted on, though more worthy of remark. Thus for\r\ninstance, if in Africa or S. America, we go from south to north{349}, or\r\nfrom lowland to upland, or from a humid to a dryer part, we find wholly\r\ndifferent species of those genera or groups which characterise the\r\ncontinent over which we are passing. In these subdivisions we may\r\nclearly observe, as in the main divisions of the world, that\r\nsub-barriers divide different groups of species, although the opposite\r\nsides of such sub-barriers may possess nearly the same climate, and may\r\nbe in other respects nearly similar: thus it is on the opposite sides of\r\nthe Cordillera of Chile, and in a lesser degree on the opposite sides of\r\nthe Rocky mountains. Deserts, arms of the sea, and even rivers form the\r\nbarriers; mere preoccupied space seems sufficient in several cases: thus\r\nEastern and Western Australia, in the same latitude, with very similar\r\nclimate and soils, have scarcely a plant, and few animals or birds, in\r\ncommon, although all belong to the peculiar genera characterising\r\nAustralia. It is in short impossible to explain the differences in the\r\ninhabitants, either of the main divisions of the world, or of these\r\nsub-divisions, by the differences in their physical conditions, and by\r\nthe adaptation of their inhabitants. Some other cause must intervene.\r\n\r\n     {349} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 349, vi. p. 496.\r\n\r\nWe can see that the destruction of sub-barriers would cause (as before\r\nremarked in the case of the main divisions) two sub-divisions to blend\r\ninto one; and we can only suppose that the original difference in the\r\nspecies, on the opposite sides of sub-barriers, is due to the creation\r\nor production of species in distinct areas, from which they have\r\nwandered till arrested by such sub-barriers. Although thus far is pretty\r\nclear, it may be asked, why, when species in the same main division of\r\nthe world were produced on opposite sides of a sub-barrier, both when\r\nexposed to similar conditions and when exposed to widely different\r\ninfluences (as on alpine and lowland tracts, as on arid and humid soils,\r\nas in cold and hot climates), have they invariably been formed on a\r\nsimilar type, and that type confined to this one division of the world?\r\nWhy when an ostrich{350} was produced in the southern parts of America,\r\nwas it formed on the American type, instead of on the African or on\r\nAustralian types? Why when hare-like and rabbit-like animals were formed\r\nto live on the Savannahs of La Plata, were they produced on the peculiar\r\nRodent type of S. America, instead of on the true{351} hare-type of\r\nNorth America, Asia and Africa? Why when borrowing Rodents, and\r\ncamel-like animals were formed to tenant the Cordillera, were they\r\nformed on the same type{352} with their representatives on the plains?\r\nWhy were the mice, and many birds of different species on the opposite\r\nsides of the Cordillera, but exposed to a very similar climate and soil,\r\ncreated on the same peculiar S. American type? Why were the plants in\r\nEastern and Western Australia, though wholly different as species,\r\nformed on the same peculiar Australian types? The generality of the\r\nrule, in so many places and under such different circumstances, makes it\r\nhighly remarkable and seems to demand some explanation.\r\n\r\n     {350} The case of the ostrich (_Rhea_) occurs in the _Origin_, Ed.\r\n     i. p. 349, vi. p. 496.\r\n\r\n     {351} <Note in original.> There is a hare in S. America,--so bad\r\n     example.\r\n\r\n     {352} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 349, vi. p. 497.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Insular Faunas._\r\n\r\nIf we now look to the character of the inhabitants of small\r\nislands{353}, we shall find that those situated close to other land have\r\na similar fauna with that land{354}, whilst those at a considerable\r\ndistance from other land often possess an almost entirely peculiar\r\nfauna. The Galapagos Archipelago{355} is a remarkable instance of this\r\nlatter fact; here almost every bird, its one mammifer, its reptiles,\r\nland and sea shells, and even fish, are almost all peculiar and distinct\r\nspecies, not found in any other quarter of the world: so are the\r\nmajority of its plants. But although situated at the distance of between\r\n500 and 600 miles from the S. American coast, it is impossible to even\r\nglance at a large part of its fauna, especially at the birds, without at\r\nonce seeing that they belong to the American type{356}. Hence, in fact,\r\ngroups of islands thus circumstanced form merely small but well-defined\r\nsub-divisions of the larger geographical divisions. But the fact is in\r\nsuch cases far more striking: for taking the Galapagos Archipelago as an\r\ninstance; in the first place we must feel convinced, seeing that every\r\nisland is wholly volcanic and bristles with craters, that in a\r\ngeological sense the whole is of recent origin comparatively with a\r\ncontinent; and as the species are nearly all peculiar, we must conclude\r\nthat they have in the same sense recently been produced on this very\r\nspot; and although in the nature of the soil, and in a lesser degree in\r\nthe climate, there is a wide difference with the nearer part of the S.\r\nAmerican coast, we see that the inhabitants have been formed on the same\r\nclosely allied type. On the other hand, these islands, as far as their\r\nphysical conditions are concerned, resemble closely the Cape de Verde\r\nvolcanic group, and yet how wholly unlike are the productions of these\r\ntwo archipelagoes. The Cape de Verde{357} group, to which may be added\r\nthe Canary Islands, are allied in their inhabitants (of which many are\r\npeculiar species) to the coast of Africa and southern Europe, in\r\nprecisely the same manner as the Galapagos Archipelago is allied to\r\nAmerica. We here clearly see that mere geographical proximity affects,\r\nmore than any relation of adaptation, the character of species. How many\r\nislands in the Pacific exist far more like in their physical conditions\r\nto Juan Fernandez than this island is to the coast of Chile, distant 300\r\nmiles; why then, except from mere proximity, should this island alone be\r\ntenanted by two very peculiar species of humming-birds--that form of\r\nbirds which is so exclusively American? Innumerable other similar cases\r\nmight be adduced.\r\n\r\n     {353} For the general problem of Oceanic Islands, see _Origin_, Ed.\r\n     i. p. 388, vi. p. 541.\r\n\r\n     {354} This is an illustration of the general theory of barriers\r\n     (_Origin_, Ed. i. p. 347, vi. p. 494). At i. p. 391, vi. p. 544 the\r\n     question is discussed from the point of view of means of transport.\r\n     Between the lines, above the words \"with that land,\" the author\r\n     wrote \"Cause, formerly joined, no one doubts after Lyell.\"\r\n\r\n     {355} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 390, vi. p. 543.\r\n\r\n     {356} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 397, vi. p. 552.\r\n\r\n     {357} The Cape de Verde and Galapagos Archipelagoes are compared in\r\n     the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 398, vi. p. 553. See also _Journal of\r\n     Researches_, 1860, p. 393.\r\n\r\nThe Galapagos Archipelago offers another, even more remarkable, example\r\nof the class of facts we are here considering. Most of its genera are,\r\nas we have said, American, many of them are mundane, or found\r\neverywhere, and some are quite or nearly confined to this archipelago.\r\nThe islands are of absolutely similar composition, and exposed to the\r\nsame climate; most of them are in sight of each other; and yet several\r\nof the islands are inhabited, each by peculiar species (or in some cases\r\nperhaps only varieties) of some of the genera characterising the\r\narchipelago. So that the small group of the Galapagos Islands typifies,\r\nand follows exactly the same laws in the distribution of its\r\ninhabitants, as a great continent. How wonderful it is that two or three\r\nclosely similar but distinct species of a mocking-thrush{358} should\r\nhave been produced on three neighbouring and absolutely similar islands;\r\nand that these three species of mocking-thrush should be closely related\r\nto the other species inhabiting wholly different climates and different\r\ndistricts of America, and only in America. No similar case so striking\r\nas this of the Galapagos Archipelago has hitherto been observed; and\r\nthis difference of the productions in the different islands may perhaps\r\nbe partly explained by the depth of the sea between them (showing that\r\nthey could not have been united within recent geological periods), and\r\nby the currents of the sea sweeping _straight_ between them,--and by\r\nstorms of wind being rare, through which means seeds and birds could be\r\nblown, or drifted, from one island to another. There are however some\r\nsimilar facts: it is said that the different, though neighbouring\r\nislands of the East Indian Archipelago are inhabited by some different\r\nspecies of the same genera; and at the Sandwich group some of the\r\nislands have each their peculiar species of the same genera of plants.\r\n\r\n     {358} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 390, a strong point is made of\r\n     birds which immigrated \"with facility and in a body\" not having\r\n     been modified. Thus the author accounts for the small percentage of\r\n     peculiar \"marine birds.\"\r\n\r\nIslands standing quite isolated within the intra-tropical oceans have\r\ngenerally very peculiar floras, related, though feebly (as in the case\r\nof St Helena{359} where almost every species is distinct), with the\r\nnearest continent: Tristan d'Acunha is feebly related, I believe, in its\r\nplants, both to Africa and S. America, not by having species in common,\r\nbut by the genera to which they belong{360}. The floras of the numerous\r\nscattered islands of the Pacific are related to each other and to all\r\nthe surrounding continents; but it has been said, that they have more of\r\nan Indo-Asiatic than American character{361}. This is somewhat\r\nremarkable, as America is nearer to all the Eastern islands, and lies in\r\nthe direction of the trade-wind and prevailing currents; on the other\r\nhand, all the heaviest gales come from the Asiatic side. But even with\r\nthe aid of these gales, it is not obvious on the ordinary theory of\r\ncreation how the possibility of migration (without we suppose, with\r\nextreme improbability, that each species with an Indo-Asiatic character\r\nhas actually travelled from the Asiatic shores, where such species do\r\nnot now exist) explains this Asiatic character in the plants of the\r\nPacific. This is no more obvious than that (as before remarked) there\r\nshould exist a relation between the creation of closely allied species\r\nin several regions of the world, and the fact of many such species\r\nhaving wide ranges; and on the other hand, of allied species confined to\r\none region of the world having in that region narrow ranges.\r\n\r\n     {359} \"The affinities of the St Helena flora are strongly South\r\n     African.\" Hooker's _Lecture on Insular Floras_ in the _Gardeners'\r\n     Chronicle_, Jan. 1867.\r\n\r\n     {360} It is impossible to make out the precise form which the\r\n     author intended to give to this sentence, but the meaning is clear.\r\n\r\n     {361} This is no doubt true, the flora of the Sandwich group\r\n     however has marked American affinities.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Alpine Floras._\r\n\r\nWe will now turn to the floras of mountain-summits which are well known\r\nto differ from the floras of the neighbouring lowlands. In certain\r\ncharacters, such as dwarfness of stature, hairiness, &c., the species\r\nfrom the most distant mountains frequently resemble each other,--a kind\r\nof analogy like that for instance of the succulency of most desert\r\nplants. Besides this analogy, Alpine plants present some eminently\r\ncurious facts in their distribution. In some cases the summits of\r\nmountains, although immensely distant from each other, are clothed by\r\nthe same identical species{362} which are likewise the same with those\r\ngrowing on the likewise very distant Arctic shores. In other cases,\r\nalthough few or none of the species may be actually identical, they are\r\nclosely related; whilst the plants of the lowland districts surrounding\r\nthe two mountains in question will be wholly dissimilar. As\r\nmountain-summits, as far as their plants are concerned, are islands\r\nrising out of an ocean of land in which the Alpine species cannot live,\r\nnor across which is there any known means of transport, this fact\r\nappears directly opposed to the conclusion which we have come to from\r\nconsidering the general distribution of organisms both on continents and\r\non islands--namely, that the degree of relationship between the\r\ninhabitants of two points depends on the completeness and nature of the\r\nbarriers between those points{363}. I believe, however, this anomalous\r\ncase admits, as we shall presently see, of some explanation. We might\r\nhave expected that the flora of a mountain summit would have presented\r\nthe same relation to the flora of the surrounding lowland country, which\r\nany isolated part of a continent does to the whole, or an island does to\r\nthe mainland, from which it is separated by a rather wide space of sea.\r\nThis in fact is the case with the plants clothing the summits of _some_\r\nmountains, which mountains it may be observed are particularly isolated;\r\nfor instance, all the species are peculiar, but they belong to the forms\r\ncharacteristic of the surrounding continent, on the mountains of\r\nCaraccas, of Van Dieman's Land and of the Cape of Good Hope{364}. On\r\nsome other mountains, for instance <in> Tierra del Fuego and in Brazil,\r\nsome of the plants though distinct species are S. American forms; whilst\r\nothers are allied to or are identical with the Alpine species of Europe.\r\nIn islands of which the lowland flora is distinct <from> but allied to\r\nthat of the nearest continent, the Alpine plants are sometimes (or\r\nperhaps mostly) eminently peculiar and distinct{365}; this is the case\r\non Teneriffe, and in a lesser degree even on some of the Mediterranean\r\nislands.\r\n\r\n     {362} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 365, vi. p. 515. The present\r\n     discussion was written before the publication of Forbes' celebrated\r\n     paper on the same subject; see _Life and Letters_, vol. I. p. 88.\r\n\r\n     {363} The apparent breakdown of the doctrine of barriers is\r\n     slightly touched on in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 365, vi. p. 515.\r\n\r\n     {364} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 375, vi. p. 526, the author points\r\n     out that on the mountains at the Cape of Good Hope \"some few\r\n     representative European forms are found, which have not been\r\n     discovered in the inter-tropical parts of Africa.\"\r\n\r\n     {365} See Hooker's _Lecture on Insular Floras_ in the _Gardeners'\r\n     Chronicle_, Jan. 1867.\r\n\r\nIf all Alpine floras had been characterised like that of the mountain of\r\nCaraccas, or of Van Dieman's Land, &c., whatever explanation is possible\r\nof the general laws of geographical distribution would have applied to\r\nthem. But the apparently anomalous case just given, namely of the\r\nmountains of Europe, of some mountains in the United States (Dr Boott)\r\nand of the summits of the Himalaya (Royle), having many identical\r\nspecies in common conjointly with the Arctic regions, and many species,\r\nthough not identical, closely allied, require a separate explanation.\r\nThe fact likewise of several of the species on the mountains of Tierra\r\ndel Fuego (and in a lesser degree on the mountains of Brazil) not\r\nbelonging to American forms, but to those of Europe, though so immensely\r\nremote, requires also a separate explanation.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Cause of the similarity in the floras of some distant mountains._\r\n\r\nNow we may with confidence affirm, from the number of the then floating\r\nicebergs and low descent of the glaciers, that within a period so near\r\nthat species of shells have remained the same, the whole of Central\r\nEurope and of North America (and perhaps of Eastern Asia) possessed a\r\nvery cold climate; and therefore it is probable that the floras of these\r\ndistricts were the same as the present Arctic one,--as is known to have\r\nbeen to some degree the case with then existing sea-shells, and those\r\nnow living on the Arctic shores. At this period the mountains must have\r\nbeen covered with ice of which we have evidence in the surfaces polished\r\nand scored by glaciers. What then would be the natural and almost\r\ninevitable effects of the gradual change into the present more temperate\r\nclimate{366}? The ice and snow would disappear from the mountains, and\r\nas new plants from the more temperate regions of the south migrated\r\nnorthward, replacing the Arctic plants, these latter would crawl{367} up\r\nthe now uncovered mountains, and likewise be driven northward to the\r\npresent Arctic shores. If the Arctic flora of that period was a nearly\r\nuniform one, as the present one is, then we should have the same plants\r\non these mountain-summits and on the present Arctic shores. On this view\r\nthe Arctic flora of that period must have been a widely extended one,\r\nmore so than even the present one; but considering how similar the\r\nphysical conditions must always be of land bordering on perpetual frost,\r\nthis does not appear a great difficulty; and may we not venture to\r\nsuppose that the almost infinitely numerous icebergs, charged with\r\ngreat masses of rocks, soil and _brushwood_{368} and often driven high\r\nup on distant beaches, might have been the means of widely distributing\r\nthe seeds of the same species?\r\n\r\n     {366} In the margin the author has written \"(Forbes).\" This may\r\n     have been inserted at a date later than 1844, or it may refer to a\r\n     work by Forbes earlier than his Alpine paper.\r\n\r\n     {367} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 367, vi. p. 517.\r\n\r\n     {368} <Note in original.> Perhaps vitality checked by cold and so\r\n     prevented germinating. <On the carriage of seeds by icebergs, see\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 363, vi. p. 513.>\r\n\r\nI will only hazard one other observation, namely that during the change\r\nfrom an extremely cold climate to a more temperate one the conditions,\r\nboth on lowland and mountain, would be singularly favourable for the\r\ndiffusion of any existing plants, which could live on land, just freed\r\nfrom the rigour of eternal winter; for it would possess no inhabitants;\r\nand we cannot doubt that _preoccupation_{369} is the chief bar to the\r\ndiffusion of plants. For amongst many other facts, how otherwise can we\r\nexplain the circumstance that the plants on the opposite, though\r\nsimilarly constituted sides of a wide river in Eastern Europe (as I was\r\ninformed by Humboldt) should be widely different; across which river\r\nbirds, swimming quadrupeds and the wind must often transport seeds; we\r\ncan only suppose that plants already occupying the soil and freely\r\nseeding check the germination of occasionally transported seeds.\r\n\r\n     {369} A note by the author gives \"many authors\" apparently as\r\n     authority for this statement.\r\n\r\nAt about the same period when icebergs were transporting boulders in N.\r\nAmerica as far as 36° south, where the cotton tree now grows in South\r\nAmerica, in latitude 42° (where the land is now clothed with forests\r\nhaving an almost tropical aspect with the trees bearing epiphytes and\r\nintertwined with canes), the same ice action was going on; is it not\r\nthen in some degree probable that at this period the whole tropical\r\nparts of the two Americas possessed{370} (as Falconer asserts that\r\nIndia did) a more temperate climate? In this case the Alpine plants of\r\nthe long chain of the Cordillera would have descended much lower and\r\nthere would have been a broad high-road{371} connecting those parts of\r\nNorth and South America which were then frigid. As the present climate\r\nsupervened, the plants occupying the districts which now are become in\r\nboth hemispheres temperate and even semi-tropical must have been driven\r\nto the Arctic and Antarctic{372} regions; and only a few of the loftiest\r\npoints of the Cordillera can have retained their former connecting\r\nflora. The transverse chain of Chiquitos might perhaps in a similar\r\nmanner during the ice-action period have served as a connecting road\r\n(though a broken one) for Alpine plants to become dispersed from the\r\nCordillera to the highlands of Brazil. It may be observed that some\r\n(though not strong) reasons can be assigned for believing that at about\r\nthis same period the two Americas were not so thoroughly divided as they\r\nnow are by the West Indies and tableland of Mexico. I will only further\r\nremark that the present most singularly close similarity in the\r\nvegetation of the lowlands of Kerguelen's Land{373} and of Tierra del\r\nFuego (Hooker), though so far apart, may perhaps be explained by the\r\ndissemination of seeds during this same cold period, by means of\r\nicebergs, as before alluded to{374}.\r\n\r\n     {370} Opposite to this passage, in the margin, the author has\r\n     written:--\"too hypothetical.\"\r\n\r\n     {371} The Cordillera is described as supplying a great line of\r\n     invasion in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 378.\r\n\r\n     {372} This is an approximation to the author's views on\r\n     trans-tropical migration (_Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 376-8). See\r\n     Thiselton-Dyer's interesting discussion in _Darwin and Modern\r\n     Science_, p. 304.\r\n\r\n     {373} See Hooker's _Lecture on Insular Floras_ in the _Gardeners'\r\n     Chronicle_, Jan. 1867.\r\n\r\n     {374} <Note by the author.> Similarity of flora of coral islands\r\n     easily explained.\r\n\r\nFinally, I think we may safely grant from the foregoing facts and\r\nreasoning that the anomalous similarity in the vegetation of certain\r\nvery distant mountain-summits is not in truth opposed to the conclusion\r\nof the intimate relation subsisting between proximity in space (in\r\naccordance with the means of transport in each class) and the degree of\r\naffinity of the inhabitants of any two countries. In the case of several\r\nquite isolated mountains, we have seen that the general law holds good.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Whether the same species has been created more than once._\r\n\r\nAs the fact of the same species of plants having been found on\r\nmountain-summits immensely remote has been one chief cause of the belief\r\nof some species having been contemporaneously produced or created at two\r\ndifferent points{375}, I will here briefly discuss this subject. On the\r\nordinary theory of creation, we can see no reason why on two similar\r\nmountain-summits two similar species may not have been created; but the\r\nopposite view, independently of its simplicity, has been generally\r\nreceived from the analogy of the general distribution of all organisms,\r\nin which (as shown in this chapter) we almost always find that great and\r\ncontinuous barriers separate distinct series; and we are naturally led\r\nto suppose that the two series have been separately created. When taking\r\na more limited view we see a river, with a quite similar country on both\r\nsides, with one side well stocked with a certain animal and on the other\r\nside not one (as is the case with the Bizcacha{376} on the opposite\r\nsides of the Plata), we are at once led to conclude that the Bizcacha\r\nwas produced on some one point or area on the western side of the\r\nriver. Considering our ignorance of the many strange chances of\r\ndiffusion by birds (which occasionally wander to immense distances) and\r\nquadrupeds swallowing seeds and ova (as in the case of the flying\r\nwater-beetle which disgorged the eggs of a fish), and of whirlwinds\r\ncarrying seeds and animals into strong upper currents (as in the case of\r\nvolcanic ashes and showers of hay, grain and fish{377}), and of the\r\npossibility of species having survived for short periods at intermediate\r\nspots and afterwards becoming extinct there{378}; and considering our\r\nknowledge of the great changes which _have_ taken place from subsidence\r\nand elevation in the surface of the earth, and of our ignorance of the\r\ngreater changes which _may have_ taken place, we ought to be very slow\r\nin admitting the probability of double creations. In the case of plants\r\non mountain-summits, I think I have shown how almost necessarily they\r\nwould, under the past conditions of the northern hemisphere, be as\r\nsimilar as are the plants on the present Arctic shores; and this ought\r\nto teach us a lesson of caution.\r\n\r\n     {375} On centres of creation see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 352, vi. p.\r\n     499.\r\n\r\n     {376} In the _Journal of Researches_, Ed. 1860, p. 124, the\r\n     distribution of the Bizcacha is described as limited by the river\r\n     Uruguay. The case is not I think given in the _Origin_.\r\n\r\n     {377} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. a special section (p. 356, vi. p.\r\n     504) is devoted to _Means of Dispersal_. The much greater\r\n     prominence given to this subject in the _Origin_ is partly\r\n     accounted for by the author's experiments being of later date,\r\n     _i.e._ 1855 (_Life and Letters_, vol. II. p. 53). The carriage of\r\n     fish by whirlwinds is given in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 384, vi. p.\r\n     536.\r\n\r\n     {378} The case of islands serving as halting places is given in the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 357, vi. p. 505. But here the evidence of this\r\n     having occurred is supposed to be lost by the subsidence of the\r\n     islands, not merely by the extinction of the species.\r\n\r\nBut the strongest argument against double creations may be drawn from\r\nconsidering the case of mammifers{379} in which, from their nature and\r\nfrom the size of their offspring, the means of distribution are more in\r\nview. There are no cases where the same species is found in _very\r\nremote_ localities, except where there is a continuous belt of land:\r\nthe Arctic region perhaps offers the strongest exception, and here we\r\nknow that animals are transported on icebergs{380}. The cases of lesser\r\ndifficulty may all receive a more or less simple explanation; I will\r\ngive only one instance; the nutria{381}, I believe, on the eastern coast\r\nof S. America live exclusively in fresh-water rivers, and I was much\r\nsurprised how they could have got into rivulets, widely apart, on the\r\ncoast of Patagonia; but on the opposite coast I found these quadrupeds\r\nliving exclusively in the sea, and hence their migration along the\r\nPatagonian coast is not surprising. There is no case of the same\r\nmammifer being found on an island far from the coast, and on the\r\nmainland, as happens with plants{382}. On the idea of double creations\r\nit would be strange if the same species of several plants should have\r\nbeen created in Australia and Europe; and no one instance of the same\r\nspecies of mammifer having been created, or aboriginally existing, in\r\ntwo as nearly remote and equally isolated points. It is more\r\nphilosophical, in such cases, as that of some plants being found in\r\nAustralia and Europe, to admit that we are ignorant of the means of\r\ntransport. I will allude only to one other case, namely, that of the\r\nMydas{383}, an Alpine animal, found only on the distant peaks of the\r\nmountains of Java: who will pretend to deny that during the ice period\r\nof the northern and southern hemispheres, and when India is believed to\r\nhave been colder, the climate might not have permitted this animal to\r\nhaunt a lower country, and thus to have passed along the ridges from\r\nsummit to summit? Mr Lyell has further observed that, _as in space, so\r\nin time_, there is no reason to believe that after the extinction of a\r\nspecies, the self-same form has ever reappeared{384}. I think, then, we\r\nmay, notwithstanding the many cases of difficulty, conclude with some\r\nconfidence that every species has been created or produced on a single\r\npoint or area.\r\n\r\n     {379} \"We find no inexplicable cases of the same mammal inhabiting\r\n     distant points of the world.\" _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 352, vi. p. 500.\r\n     See also _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 393, vi. p. 547.\r\n\r\n     {380} <Note by the author.> Many authors. <See _Origin_, Ed. i. p.\r\n     394, vi. p. 547.>\r\n\r\n     {381} _Nutria_ is the Spanish for otter, and is now a synonym for\r\n     _Lutra_. The otter on the Atlantic coast is distinguished by minute\r\n     differences from the Pacific species. Both forms are said to take\r\n     to the sea. In fact the case presents no especial difficulties.\r\n\r\n     {382} In _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 394, vi. p. 548, bats are mentioned as\r\n     an explicable exception to this statement.\r\n\r\n     {383} This reference is doubtless to _Mydaus_, a badger-like animal\r\n     from the mountains of Java and Sumatra (Wallace, _Geographical\r\n     Distribution_, ii. p. 199). The instance does not occur in the\r\n     _Origin_ but the author remarks (_Origin_, Ed. i. p. 376, vi. p.\r\n     527) that cases, strictly analogous to the distribution of plants,\r\n     occur among terrestrial mammals.\r\n\r\n     {384} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 313, vi. p. 454.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the number of species, and of the classes to which they belong in\r\ndifferent regions._\r\n\r\nThe last fact in geographical distribution, which, as far as I can see,\r\nin any way concerns the origin of species, relates to the absolute\r\nnumber and nature of the organic beings inhabiting different tracts of\r\nland. Although every species is admirably adapted (but not necessarily\r\nbetter adapted than every other species, as we have seen in the great\r\nincrease of introduced species) to the country and station it frequents;\r\nyet it has been shown that the entire difference between the species in\r\ndistant countries cannot possibly be explained by the difference of the\r\nphysical conditions of these countries. In the same manner, I believe,\r\nneither the number of the species, nor the nature of the great classes\r\nto which they belong, can possibly in all cases be explained by the\r\nconditions of their country. New Zealand{385}, a linear island\r\nstretching over about 700 miles of latitude, with forests, marshes,\r\nplains and mountains reaching to the limits of eternal snow, has far\r\nmore diversified habitats than an equal area at the Cape of Good Hope;\r\nand yet, I believe, at the Cape of Good Hope there are, of phanerogamic\r\nplants, from five to ten times the number of species as in all New\r\nZealand. Why on the theory of absolute creations should this large and\r\ndiversified island only have from 400 to 500 (? Dieffenbach)\r\nphanerogamic plants? and why should the Cape of Good Hope, characterised\r\nby the uniformity of its scenery, swarm with more species of plants than\r\nprobably any other quarter of the world? Why on the ordinary theory\r\nshould the Galapagos Islands abound with terrestrial reptiles? and why\r\nshould many equal-sized islands in the Pacific be without a single\r\none{386} or with only one or two species? Why should the great island of\r\nNew Zealand be without one mammiferous quadruped except the mouse, and\r\nthat was probably introduced with the aborigines? Why should not one\r\nisland (it can be shown, I think, that the mammifers of Mauritius and St\r\nIago have all been introduced) in the open ocean possess a mammiferous\r\nquadruped? Let it not be said that quadrupeds cannot live in islands,\r\nfor we know that cattle, horses and pigs during a long period have run\r\nwild in the West Indian and Falkland Islands; pigs at St Helena; goats\r\nat Tahiti; asses in the Canary Islands; dogs in Cuba; cats at Ascension;\r\nrabbits at Madeira and the Falklands; monkeys at St Iago and the\r\nMauritius; even elephants during a long time in one of the very small\r\nSooloo Islands; and European mice on very many of the smallest islands\r\nfar from the habitations of man{387}. Nor let it be assumed that\r\nquadrupeds are more slowly created and hence that the oceanic islands,\r\nwhich generally are of volcanic formation, are of too recent origin to\r\npossess them; for we know (Lyell) that new forms of quadrupeds succeed\r\neach other quicker than Mollusca or Reptilia. Nor let it be assumed\r\n(though such an assumption would be no explanation) that quadrupeds\r\ncannot be created on small islands; for islands not lying in mid-ocean\r\ndo possess their peculiar quadrupeds; thus many of the smaller islands\r\nof the East Indian Archipelago possess quadrupeds; as does Fernando Po\r\non the West Coast of Africa; as the Falkland Islands possess a peculiar\r\nwolf-like fox{388}; so do the Galapagos Islands a peculiar mouse of the\r\nS. American type. These two last are the most remarkable cases with\r\nwhich I am acquainted; inasmuch as the islands lie further from other\r\nland. It is possible that the Galapagos mouse may have been introduced\r\nin some ship from the S. American coast (though the species is at\r\npresent unknown there), for the aboriginal species soon haunts the goods\r\nof man, as I noticed in the roof of a newly erected shed in a desert\r\ncountry south of the Plata. The Falkland Islands, though between 200 and\r\n300 miles from the S. American coast, may in one sense be considered as\r\nintimately connected with it; for it is certain that formerly many\r\nicebergs loaded with boulders were stranded on its southern coast, and\r\nthe old canoes which are occasionally now stranded, show that the\r\ncurrents still set from Tierra del Fuego. This fact, however, does not\r\nexplain the presence of the _Canis antarcticus_ on the Falkland Islands,\r\nunless we suppose that it formerly lived on the mainland and became\r\nextinct there, whilst it survived on these islands, to which it was\r\nborne (as happens with its northern congener, the common wolf) on an\r\niceberg, but this fact removes the anomaly of an island, in appearance\r\neffectually separated from other land, having its own species of\r\nquadruped, and makes the case like that of Java and Sumatra, each having\r\ntheir own rhinoceros.\r\n\r\n     {385} The comparison between New Zealand and the Cape is given in\r\n     the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 389, vi. p. 542.\r\n\r\n     {386} In a corresponding discussion in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 393,\r\n     vi. p. 546, stress is laid on the distribution of Batrachians not\r\n     of reptiles.\r\n\r\n     {387} The whole argument is given--more briefly than here--in the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 394, vi. p. 547.\r\n\r\n     {388} See _Origin_, Ed i. p. 393, vi. p. 547. The discussion is\r\n     much fuller in the present Essay.\r\n\r\nBefore summing up all the facts given in this section on the present\r\ncondition of organic beings, and endeavouring to see how far they admit\r\nof explanation, it will be convenient to state all such facts in the\r\npast geographical distribution of extinct beings as seem anyway to\r\nconcern the theory of descent.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION SECOND.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Geographical distribution of extinct organisms._\r\n\r\nI have stated that if the land of the entire world be divided into (we\r\nwill say) three sections, according to the amount of difference of the\r\nterrestrial mammifers inhabiting them, we shall have three unequal\r\ndivisions of (1st) Australia and its dependent islands, (2nd) South\r\nAmerica, (3rd) Europe, Asia and Africa. If we now look to the mammifers\r\nwhich inhabited these three divisions during the later Tertiary periods,\r\nwe shall find them almost as distinct as at the present day, and\r\nintimately related in each division to the existing forms in that\r\ndivision{389}. This is wonderfully the case with the several fossil\r\nMarsupial genera in the caverns of New South Wales and even more\r\nwonderfully so in South America, where we have the same peculiar group\r\nof monkeys, of a guanaco-like animal, of many rodents, of the Marsupial\r\nDidelphys, of Armadilloes and other Edentata. This last family is at\r\npresent very characteristic of S. America, and in a late Tertiary epoch\r\nit was even more so, as is shown by the numerous enormous animals of the\r\nMegatheroid family, some of which were protected by an osseous armour\r\nlike that, but on a gigantic scale, of the recent Armadillo. Lastly,\r\nover Europe the remains of the several deer, oxen, bears, foxes,\r\nbeavers, field-mice, show a relation to the present inhabitants of this\r\nregion; and the contemporaneous remains of the elephant, rhinoceros,\r\nhippopotamus, hyæna, show a relation with the grand Africo-Asiatic\r\ndivision of the world. In Asia the fossil mammifers of the Himalaya\r\n(though mingled with forms long extinct in Europe) are equally related\r\nto the existing forms of the Africo-Asiatic division; but especially to\r\nthose of India itself. As the gigantic and now extinct quadrupeds of\r\nEurope have naturally excited more attention than the other and smaller\r\nremains, the relation between the past and the present mammiferous\r\ninhabitants of Europe has not been sufficiently attended to. But in fact\r\nthe mammifers of Europe are at present nearly as much Africo-Asiatic as\r\nthey were formerly when Europe had its elephants and rhinoceroses, etc.;\r\nEurope neither now nor then possessed peculiar groups as does Australia\r\nand S. America. The extinction of certain peculiar forms in one quarter\r\ndoes not make the remaining mammifers of that quarter less related to\r\nits own great division of the world: though Tierra del Fuego possesses\r\nonly a fox, three rodents, and the guanaco, no one (as these all belong\r\nto S. American types, but not to the most characteristic forms) would\r\ndoubt for one minute <as to> classifying this district with S. America;\r\nand if fossil Edentata, Marsupials and monkeys were to be found in\r\nTierra del Fuego, it would not make this district more truly S. American\r\nthan it now is. So it is with Europe{390}, and so far as is known with\r\nAsia, for the lately past and present mammifers all belong to the\r\nAfrico-Asiatic division of the world. In every case, I may add, the\r\nforms which a country has is of more importance in geographical\r\narrangement than what it has not.\r\n\r\n     {389} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 339, vi. p. 485.\r\n\r\n     {390} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 339, vi. p. 485, which corresponds\r\n     to this part of the present Essay, the author does not make a\r\n     separate section for such cases as the occurrence of fossil\r\n     Marsupials in Europe (_Origin_, Ed. i. p. 340, vi. p. 486) as he\r\n     does in the present Essay; see the section on _Changes in\r\n     geographical distribution_, p. 177.\r\n\r\nWe find some evidence of the same general fact in a relation between the\r\nrecent and the Tertiary sea-shells, in the different main divisions of\r\nthe marine world.\r\n\r\nThis general and most remarkable relation between the lately past and\r\npresent mammiferous inhabitants of the three main divisions of the world\r\nis precisely the same kind of fact as the relation between the different\r\nspecies of the several sub-regions of any one of the main divisions. As\r\nwe usually associate great physical changes with the total extinction of\r\none series of beings, and its succession by another series, this\r\nidentity of relation between the past and the present races of beings in\r\nthe same quarters of the globe is more striking than the same relation\r\nbetween existing beings in different sub-regions: but in truth we have\r\nno reason for supposing that a change in the conditions has in any of\r\nthese cases supervened, greater than that now existing between the\r\ntemperate and tropical, or between the highlands and lowlands of the\r\nsame main divisions, now tenanted by related beings. Finally, then, we\r\nclearly see that in each main division of the world the same relation\r\nholds good between its inhabitants in time as over space{391}.\r\n\r\n     {391} \"We can understand how it is that all the forms of life,\r\n     ancient and recent, make together one grand system; for all are\r\n     connected by generation.\" _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 344, vi. p. 491.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Changes in geographical distribution._\r\n\r\nIf, however, we look closer, we shall find that even Australia, in\r\npossessing a terrestrial Pachyderm, was so far less distinct from the\r\nrest of the world than it now is; so was S. America in possessing the\r\nMastodon, horse, [hyæna,]{392} and antelope. N. America, as I have\r\nremarked, is now, in its mammifers, in some respects neutral ground\r\nbetween S. America and the great Africo-Asiatic division; formerly, in\r\npossessing the horse, Mastodon and three Megatheroid animals, it was\r\nmore nearly related to S. America; but in the horse and Mastodon, and\r\nlikewise in having the elephant, oxen, sheep, and pigs, it was as much,\r\nif not more, related to the Africo-Asiatic division. Again, northern\r\nIndia was much more closely related (in having the giraffe,\r\nhippopotamus, and certain musk-deer) to southern Africa than it now is;\r\nfor southern and eastern Africa deserve, if we divide the world into\r\nfive parts, to make one division by itself. Turning to the dawn of the\r\nTertiary period, we must, from our ignorance of other portions of the\r\nworld, confine ourselves to Europe; and at that period, in the presence\r\nof Marsupials{393} and Edentata, we behold an _entire_ blending of those\r\nmammiferous forms which now eminently characterise Australia and S.\r\nAmerica{394}.\r\n\r\n     {392} The word _hyæna_ is erased. There appear to be no fossil\r\n     Hyænidæ in S. America.\r\n\r\n     {393} See note 1{390}, p. 175, also _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 340, vi. p. 486.\r\n\r\n     {394} <Note by the author.> And see Eocene European mammals in\r\n     N. America.\r\n\r\nIf we now look at the distribution of sea-shells, we find the same\r\nchanges in distribution. The Red Sea and the Mediterranean were more\r\nnearly related in these shells than they now are. In different parts of\r\nEurope, on the other hand, during the Miocene period, the sea-shells\r\nseem to have been more different than at present. In{395} the Tertiary\r\nperiod, according to Lyell, the shells of N. America and Europe were\r\nless related than at present, and during the Cretaceous still less like;\r\nwhereas, during this same Cretaceous period, the shells of India and\r\nEurope were more like than at present. But going further back to the\r\nCarbonaceous period, in N. America and Europe, the productions were much\r\nmore like than they now are{396}. These facts harmonise with the\r\nconclusions drawn from the present distribution of organic beings, for\r\nwe have seen, that from species being created in different points or\r\nareas, the formation of a barrier would cause or make two distinct\r\ngeographical areas; and the destruction of a barrier would permit their\r\ndiffusion{397}. And as long-continued geological changes must both\r\ndestroy and make barriers, we might expect, the further we looked\r\nbackwards, the more changed should we find the present distribution.\r\nThis conclusion is worthy of attention; because, finding in widely\r\ndifferent parts of the same main division of the world, and in volcanic\r\nislands near them, groups of distinct, but related, species;--and\r\nfinding that a singularly analogous relation holds good with respect to\r\nthe beings of past times, when none of the present species were living,\r\na person might be tempted to believe in some mystical relation between\r\ncertain areas of the world, and the production of certain organic forms;\r\nbut we now see that such an assumption would have to be complicated by\r\nthe admission that such a relation, though holding good for long\r\nrevolutions of years, is not truly persistent.\r\n\r\n     {395} <Note by the author.> All this requires much verification.\r\n\r\n     {396} This point seems to be less insisted on in the _Origin_.\r\n\r\n     {397} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 356, vi. p. 504.\r\n\r\nI will only add one more observation to this section. Geologists\r\nfinding in the most remote period with which we are acquainted, namely\r\nin the Silurian period, that the shells and other marine\r\nproductions{398} in North and South America, in Europe, Southern Africa,\r\nand Western Asia, are much more similar than they now are at these\r\ndistant points, appear to have imagined that in these ancient times the\r\nlaws of geographical distribution were quite different than what they\r\nnow are: but we have only to suppose that great continents were extended\r\neast and west, and thus did not divide the inhabitants of the temperate\r\nand tropical seas, as the continents now do; and it would then become\r\nprobable that the inhabitants of the seas would be much more similar\r\nthan they now are. In the immense space of ocean extending from the east\r\ncoast of Africa to the eastern islands of the Pacific, which space is\r\nconnected either by lines of tropical coast or by islands not very\r\ndistant from each other, we know (Cuming) that many shells, perhaps even\r\nas many as 200, are common to the Zanzibar coast, the Philippines, and\r\nthe eastern islands of the Low or Dangerous Archipelago in the Pacific.\r\nThis space equals that from the Arctic to the Antarctic pole! Pass over\r\nthe space of quite open ocean, from the Dangerous Archipelago to the\r\nwest coast of S. America, and every shell is different: pass over the\r\nnarrow space of S. America, to its eastern shores, and again every shell\r\nis different! Many fish, I may add, are also common to the Pacific and\r\nIndian Oceans.\r\n\r\n     {398} <Note by the author.> D'Orbigny shows that this is not so.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Summary on the distribution of living and extinct organic beings._\r\n\r\nLet us sum up the several facts now given with respect to the past and\r\npresent geographical distribution of organic beings. In a previous\r\nchapter it was shown that species are not exterminated by universal\r\ncatastrophes, and that they are slowly produced: we have also seen that\r\neach species is probably only once produced, on one point or area once\r\nin time; and that each diffuses itself, as far as barriers and its\r\nconditions of life permit. If we look at any one main division of the\r\nland, we find in the different parts, whether exposed to different\r\nconditions or to the same conditions, many groups of species wholly or\r\nnearly distinct as species, nevertheless intimately related. We find the\r\ninhabitants of islands, though distinct as species, similarly related to\r\nthe inhabitants of the nearest continent; we find in some cases, that\r\neven the different islands of one such group are inhabited by species\r\ndistinct, though intimately related to one another and to those of the\r\nnearest continent:--thus typifying the distribution of organic beings\r\nover the whole world. We find the floras of distant mountain-summits\r\neither very similar (which seems to admit, as shown, of a simple\r\nexplanation) or very distinct but related to the floras of the\r\nsurrounding region; and hence, in this latter case, the floras of two\r\nmountain-summits, although exposed to closely similar conditions, will\r\nbe very different. On the mountain-summits of islands, characterised by\r\npeculiar faunas and floras, the plants are often eminently peculiar. The\r\ndissimilarity of the organic beings inhabiting nearly similar countries\r\nis best seen by comparing the main divisions of the world; in each of\r\nwhich some districts may be found very similarly exposed, yet the\r\ninhabitants are wholly unlike;--far more unlike than those in very\r\ndissimilar districts in the same main division. We see this strikingly\r\nin comparing two volcanic archipelagoes, with nearly the same climate,\r\nbut situated not very far from two different continents; in which case\r\ntheir inhabitants are totally unlike. In the different main divisions of\r\nthe world, the amount of difference between the organisms, even in the\r\nsame class, is widely different, each main division having only the\r\nspecies distinct in some families, in other families having the genera\r\ndistinct. The distribution of aquatic organisms is very different from\r\nthat of the terrestrial organisms; and necessarily so, from the barriers\r\nto their progress being quite unlike. The nature of the conditions in an\r\nisolated district will not explain the number of species inhabiting it;\r\nnor the absence of one class or the presence of another class. We find\r\nthat terrestrial mammifers are not present on islands far removed from\r\nother land. We see in two regions, that the species though distinct are\r\nmore or less related, according to the greater or less _possibility_ of\r\nthe transportal in past and present times of species from one to the\r\nother region; although we can hardly admit that all the species in such\r\ncases have been transported from the first to the second region, and\r\nsince have become extinct in the first: we see this law in the presence\r\nof the fox on the Falkland Islands; in the European character of some of\r\nthe plants of Tierra del Fuego; in the Indo-Asiatic character of the\r\nplants of the Pacific; and in the circumstance of those genera which\r\nrange widest having many species with wide ranges; and those genera with\r\nrestricted ranges having species with restricted ranges. Finally, we\r\nfind in each of the main divisions of the land, and probably of the sea,\r\nthat the existing organisms are related to those lately extinct.\r\n\r\nLooking further backwards we see that the past geographical distribution\r\nof organic beings was different from the present; and indeed,\r\nconsidering that geology shows that all our land was once under water,\r\nand that where water now extends land is forming, the reverse could\r\nhardly have been possible.\r\n\r\nNow these several facts, though evidently all more or less connected\r\ntogether, must by the creationist (though the geologist may explain some\r\nof the anomalies) be considered as so many ultimate facts. He can only\r\nsay, that it so pleased the Creator that the organic beings of the\r\nplains, deserts, mountains, tropical and temperature forests, of S.\r\nAmerica, should all have some affinity together; that the inhabitants of\r\nthe Galapagos Archipelago should be related to those of Chile; and that\r\nsome of the species on the similarly constituted islands of this\r\narchipelago, though most closely related, should be distinct; that all\r\nits inhabitants should be totally unlike those of the similarly volcanic\r\nand arid Cape de Verde and Canary Islands; that the plants on the summit\r\nof Teneriffe should be eminently peculiar; that the diversified island\r\nof New Zealand should have not many plants, and not one, or only one,\r\nmammifer; that the mammifers of S. America, Australia and Europe should\r\nbe clearly related to their ancient and exterminated prototypes; and so\r\non with other facts. But it is absolutely opposed to every analogy,\r\ndrawn from the laws imposed by the Creator on inorganic matter, that\r\nfacts, when connected, should be considered as ultimate and not the\r\ndirect consequences of more general laws.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION THIRD.\r\n\r\n\r\n_An attempt to explain the foregoing laws of geographical distribution,\r\non the theory of allied species having a common descent._\r\n\r\nFirst let us recall the circumstances most favourable for variation\r\nunder domestication, as given in the first chapter--viz. 1st, a change,\r\nor repeated changes, in the conditions to which the organism has been\r\nexposed, continued through several seminal (_i.e._ not by buds or\r\ndivisions) generations: 2nd, steady selection of the slight varieties\r\nthus generated with a fixed end in view: 3rd, isolation as perfect as\r\npossible of such selected varieties; that is, the preventing their\r\ncrossing with other forms; this latter condition applies to all\r\nterrestrial animals, to most if not all plants and perhaps even to most\r\n(or all) aquatic organisms. It will be convenient here to show the\r\nadvantage of isolation in the formation of a new breed, by comparing the\r\nprogress of two persons (to neither of whom let time be of any\r\nconsequence) endeavouring to select and form some very peculiar new\r\nbreed. Let one of these persons work on the vast herds of cattle in the\r\nplains of La Plata{399}, and the other on a small stock of 20 or 30\r\nanimals in an island. The latter might have to wait centuries (by the\r\nhypothesis of no importance){400} before he obtained a \"sport\"\r\napproaching to what he wanted; but when he did and saved the greater\r\nnumber of its offspring and their offspring again, he might hope that\r\nhis whole little stock would be in some degree affected, so that by\r\ncontinued selection he might gain his end. But on the Pampas, though\r\nthe man might get his first approach to his desired form sooner, how\r\nhopeless would it be to attempt, by saving its offspring amongst so many\r\nof the common kind, to affect the whole herd: the effect of this one\r\npeculiar \"sport{401}\" would be quite lost before he could obtain a\r\nsecond original sport of the same kind. If, however, he could separate a\r\nsmall number of cattle, including the offspring of the desirable\r\n\"sport,\" he might hope, like the man on the island, to effect his end.\r\nIf there be organic beings of which two individuals _never_ unite, then\r\nsimple selection whether on a continent or island would be equally\r\nserviceable to make a new and desirable breed; and this new breed might\r\nbe made in surprisingly few years from the great and geometrical powers\r\nof propagation to beat out the old breed; as has happened\r\n(notwithstanding crossing) where good breeds of dogs and pigs have been\r\nintroduced into a limited country,--for instance, into the islands of\r\nthe Pacific.\r\n\r\n     {399} This instance occurs in the Essay of 1842, p. 32, but not in\r\n     the _Origin_; though the importance of isolation is discussed\r\n     (_Origin_, Ed. i. p. 104, vi. p. 127).\r\n\r\n     {400} The meaning of the words within parenthesis is obscure.\r\n\r\n     {401} It is unusual to find the author speaking of the selection of\r\n     _sports_ rather than small variations.\r\n\r\nLet us now take the simplest natural case of an islet upheaved by the\r\nvolcanic or subterranean forces in a deep sea, at such a distance from\r\nother land that only a few organic beings at rare intervals were\r\ntransported to it, whether borne by the sea{402} (like the seeds of\r\nplants to coral-reefs), or by hurricanes, or by floods, or on rafts, or\r\nin roots of large trees, or the germs of one plant or animal attached to\r\nor in the stomach of some other animal, or by the intervention (in most\r\ncases the most probable means) of other islands since sunk or destroyed.\r\nIt may be remarked that when one part of the earth's crust is raised it\r\nis probably the general rule that another part sinks. Let this island\r\ngo on slowly, century after century, rising foot by foot; and in the\r\ncourse of time we shall have instead <of> a small mass of rock{403},\r\nlowland and highland, moist woods and dry sandy spots, various soils,\r\nmarshes, streams and pools: under water on the sea shore, instead of a\r\nrocky steeply shelving coast, we shall have in some parts bays with mud,\r\nsandy beaches and rocky shoals. The formation of the island by itself\r\nmust often slightly affect the surrounding climate. It is impossible\r\nthat the first few transported organisms could be perfectly adapted to\r\nall these stations; and it will be a chance if those successively\r\ntransported will be so adapted. The greater number would probably come\r\nfrom the lowlands of the nearest country; and not even all these would\r\nbe perfectly adapted to the new islet whilst it continued low and\r\nexposed to coast influences. Moreover, as it is certain that all\r\norganisms are nearly as much adapted in their structure to the other\r\ninhabitants of their country as they are to its physical conditions, so\r\nthe mere fact that a _few_ beings (and these taken in great degree by\r\nchance) were in the first case transported to the islet, would in itself\r\ngreatly modify their conditions{404}. As the island continued rising we\r\nmight also expect an occasional new visitant; and I repeat that even one\r\nnew being must often affect beyond our calculation by occupying the room\r\nand taking part of the subsistence of another (and this again from\r\nanother and so on), several or many other organisms. Now as the first\r\ntransported and any occasional successive visitants spread or tended to\r\nspread over the growing island, they would undoubtedly be exposed\r\nthrough several generations to new and varying conditions: it might also\r\neasily happen that some of the species _on an average_ might obtain an\r\nincrease of food, or food of a more nourishing quality{405}. According\r\nthen to every analogy with what we have seen takes place in every\r\ncountry, with nearly every organic being under domestication, we might\r\nexpect that some of the inhabitants of the island would \"sport,\" or have\r\ntheir organization rendered in some degree plastic. As the number of the\r\ninhabitants are supposed to be few and as all these cannot be so well\r\nadapted to their new and varying conditions as they were in their native\r\ncountry and habitat, we cannot believe that every place or office in the\r\neconomy of the island would be as well filled as on a continent where\r\nthe number of aboriginal species is far greater and where they\r\nconsequently hold a more strictly limited place. We might therefore\r\nexpect on our island that although very many slight variations were of\r\nno use to the plastic individuals, yet that occasionally in the course\r\nof a century an individual might be born{406} of which the structure or\r\nconstitution in some slight degree would allow it better to fill up some\r\noffice in the insular economy and to struggle against other species. If\r\nsuch were the case the individual and its offspring would have a better\r\n_chance_ of surviving and of beating out its parent form; and if (as is\r\nprobable) it and its offspring crossed with the unvaried parent form,\r\nyet the number of the individuals being not very great, there would be a\r\nchance of the new and more serviceable form being nevertheless in some\r\nslight degree preserved. The struggle for existence would go on annually\r\nselecting such individuals until a new race or species was formed.\r\nEither few or all the first visitants to the island might become\r\nmodified, according as the physical conditions of the island and those\r\nresulting from the kind and number of other transported species were\r\ndifferent from those of the parent country--according to the\r\ndifficulties offered to fresh immigration--and according to the length\r\nof time since the first inhabitants were introduced. It is obvious that\r\nwhatever was the country, generally the nearest from which the first\r\ntenants were transported, they would show an affinity, even if all had\r\nbecome modified, to the natives of that country and even if the\r\ninhabitants of the same source (?) had been modified. On this view we\r\ncan at once understand the cause and meaning of the affinity of the\r\nfauna and flora of the Galapagos Islands with that of the coast of S.\r\nAmerica; and consequently why the inhabitants of these islands show not\r\nthe smallest affinity with those inhabiting other volcanic islands, with\r\na very similar climate and soil, near the coast of Africa{407}.\r\n\r\n     {402} This brief discussion is represented in the _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     by a much fuller one (pp. 356, 383, vi. pp. 504, 535). See,\r\n     however, the section in the present Essay, p. 168.\r\n\r\n     {403} On the formation of new stations, see _Origin_, Ed. i. p.\r\n     292, vi. p. 429.\r\n\r\n     {404} _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 390, 400, vi. pp. 543, 554.\r\n\r\n     {405} In the MS. _some of the species ... nourishing quality_ is\r\n     doubtfully erased. It seems clear that he doubted whether such a\r\n     problematical supply of food would be likely to cause variation.\r\n\r\n     {406} At this time the author clearly put more faith in the\r\n     importance of sport-like variation than in later years.\r\n\r\n     {407} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 398, vi. p. 553.\r\n\r\nTo return once again to our island, if by the continued action of the\r\nsubterranean forces other neighbouring islands were formed, these would\r\ngenerally be stocked by the inhabitants of the first island, or by a few\r\nimmigrants from the neighbouring mainland; but if considerable obstacles\r\nwere interposed to any communication between the terrestrial productions\r\nof these islands, and their conditions were different (perhaps only by\r\nthe number of different species on each island), a form transported from\r\none island to another might become altered in the same manner as one\r\nfrom the continent; and we should have several of the islands tenanted\r\nby representative races or species, as is so wonderfully the case with\r\nthe different islands of the Galapagos Archipelago. As the islands\r\nbecome mountainous, if mountain-species were not introduced, as could\r\nrarely happen, a greater amount of variation and selection would be\r\nrequisite to adapt the species, which originally came from the lowlands\r\nof the nearest continent, to the mountain-summits than to the lower\r\ndistricts of our islands. For the lowland species from the continent\r\nwould have first to struggle against other species and other conditions\r\non the coast-land of the island, and so probably become modified by the\r\nselection of its best fitted varieties, then to undergo the same process\r\nwhen the land had attained a moderate elevation; and then lastly when it\r\nhad become Alpine. Hence we can understand why the faunas of insular\r\nmountain-summits are, as in the case of Teneriffe, eminently peculiar.\r\nPutting on one side the case of a widely extended flora being driven up\r\nthe mountain-summits, during a change of climate from cold to temperate,\r\nwe can see why in other cases the floras of mountain-summits (or as I\r\nhave called them islands in a sea of land) should be tenanted by\r\npeculiar species, but related to those of the surrounding lowlands, as\r\nare the inhabitants of a real island in the sea to those of the nearest\r\ncontinent{408}.\r\n\r\n     {408} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 403, vi. p. 558, where the author\r\n     speaks of Alpine humming birds, rodents, plants, &c. in S. America,\r\n     all of strictly American forms. In the MS. the author has added\r\n     between the lines \"As world has been getting hotter, there has been\r\n     radiation from high-lands,--old view?--curious; I presume Diluvian\r\n     in origin.\"\r\n\r\nLet us now consider the effect of a change of climate or of other\r\nconditions on the inhabitants of a continent and of an isolated island\r\nwithout any great change of level. On a continent the chief effects\r\nwould be changes in the numerical proportion of the individuals of the\r\ndifferent species; for whether the climate became warmer or colder,\r\ndrier or damper, more uniform or extreme, some species are at present\r\nadapted to its diversified districts; if for instance it became cooler,\r\nspecies would migrate from its more temperate parts and from its higher\r\nland; if damper, from its damper regions, &c. On a small and isolated\r\nisland, however, with few species, and these not adapted to much\r\ndiversified conditions, such changes instead of merely increasing the\r\nnumber of certain species already adapted to such conditions, and\r\ndecreasing the number of other species, would be apt to affect the\r\nconstitutions of some of the insular species: thus if the island became\r\ndamper it might well happen that there were no species living in any\r\npart of it adapted to the consequences resulting from more moisture. In\r\nthis case therefore, and still more (as we have seen) during the\r\nproduction of new stations from the elevation of the land, an island\r\nwould be a far more fertile source, as far as we can judge, of new\r\nspecific forms than a continent. The new forms thus generated on an\r\nisland, we might expect, would occasionally be transported by accident,\r\nor through long-continued geographical changes be enabled to emigrate\r\nand thus become slowly diffused.\r\n\r\nBut if we look to the origin of a continent; almost every geologist will\r\nadmit that in most cases it will have first existed as separate islands\r\nwhich gradually increased in size{409}; and therefore all that which has\r\nbeen said concerning the probable changes of the forms tenanting a small\r\narchipelago is applicable to a continent in its early state.\r\nFurthermore, a geologist who reflects on the geological history of\r\nEurope (the only region well known) will admit that it has been many\r\ntimes depressed, raised and left stationary. During the sinking of a\r\ncontinent and the probable generally accompanying changes of climate the\r\neffect would be little, _except_ on the numerical proportions and in the\r\nextinction (from the lessening of rivers, the drying of marshes and the\r\nconversion of high-lands into low &c.) of some or of many of the\r\nspecies. As soon however as the continent became divided into many\r\nisolated portions or islands, preventing free immigration from one part\r\nto another, the effect of climatic and other changes on the species\r\nwould be greater. But let the now broken continent, forming isolated\r\nislands, begin to rise and new stations thus to be formed, exactly as in\r\nthe first case of the upheaved volcanic islet, and we shall have equally\r\nfavourable conditions for the modification of old forms, that is the\r\nformation of new races or species. Let the islands become reunited into\r\na continent; and then the new and old forms would all spread, as far as\r\nbarriers, the means of transportal, and the preoccupation of the land by\r\nother species, would permit. Some of the new species or races would\r\nprobably become extinct, and some perhaps would cross and blend\r\ntogether. We should thus have a multitude of forms, adapted to all kinds\r\nof slightly different stations, and to diverse groups of either\r\nantagonist or food-serving species. The oftener these oscillations of\r\nlevel had taken place (and therefore generally the older the land) the\r\ngreater the number of species <which> would tend to be formed. The\r\ninhabitants of a continent being thus derived in the first stage from\r\nthe same original parents, and subsequently from the inhabitants of one\r\nwide area, since often broken up and reunited, all would be obviously\r\nrelated together and the inhabitants of the most _dissimilar_ stations\r\non the same continent would be more closely allied than the inhabitants\r\nof two very _similar_ stations on two of the main divisions of the\r\nworld{410}.\r\n\r\n     {409} See the comparison between the Malay Archipelago and the\r\n     probable former state of Europe, _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 299, vi. p.\r\n     438, also _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 292, vi. p. 429.\r\n\r\n     {410} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 349, vi. p. 496. The arrangement of the\r\n     argument in the present Essay leads to repetition of statements\r\n     made in the earlier part of the book: in the _Origin_ this is\r\n     avoided.\r\n\r\nI need hardly point out that we now can obviously see why the number of\r\nspecies in two districts, independently of the number of stations in\r\nsuch districts, should be in some cases as widely different as in New\r\nZealand and the Cape of Good Hope{411}. We can see, knowing the\r\ndifficulty in the transport of terrestrial mammals, why islands far from\r\nmainlands do not possess them{412}; we see the general reason, namely\r\naccidental transport (though not the precise reason), why certain\r\nislands should, and others should not, possess members of the class of\r\nreptiles. We can see why an ancient channel of communication between two\r\ndistant points, as the Cordillera probably was between southern Chile\r\nand the United States during the former cold periods; and icebergs\r\nbetween the Falkland Islands and Tierra del Fuego; and gales, at a\r\nformer or present time, between the Asiatic shores of the Pacific and\r\neastern islands in this ocean; is connected with (or we may now say\r\ncauses) an affinity between the species, though distinct, in two such\r\ndistricts. We can see how the better chance of diffusion, from several\r\nof the species of any genus having wide ranges in their own countries,\r\nexplains the presence of other species of the same genus in other\r\ncountries{413}; and on the other hand, of species of restricted powers\r\nof ranging, forming genera with restricted ranges.\r\n\r\n     {411} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 389, vi. p. 542.\r\n\r\n     {412} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 393, vi. p. 547.\r\n\r\n     {413} _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 350, 404, vi. pp. 498, 559.\r\n\r\nAs every one would be surprised if two exactly similar but peculiar\r\nvarieties{414} of any species were raised by man by long continued\r\nselection, in two different countries, or at two very different periods,\r\nso we ought not to expect that an exactly similar form would be produced\r\nfrom the modification of an old one in two distinct countries or at two\r\ndistinct periods. For in such places and times they would probably be\r\nexposed to somewhat different climates and almost certainly to different\r\nassociates. Hence we can see why each species appears to have been\r\nproduced singly, in space and in time. I need hardly remark that,\r\naccording to this theory of descent, there is no necessity of\r\nmodification in a species, when it reaches a new and isolated country.\r\nIf it be able to survive and if slight variations better adapted to the\r\nnew conditions are not selected, it might retain (as far as we can see)\r\nits old form for an indefinite time. As we see that some sub-varieties\r\nproduced under domestication are more variable than others, so in\r\nnature, perhaps, some species and genera are more variable than others.\r\nThe same precise form, however, would probably be seldom preserved\r\nthrough successive geological periods, or in widely and differently\r\nconditioned countries{415}.\r\n\r\n     {414} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 352, vi. p. 500.\r\n\r\n     {415} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 313, vi. p. 454.\r\n\r\nFinally, during the long periods of time and probably of oscillations of\r\nlevel, necessary for the formation of a continent, we may conclude (as\r\nabove explained) that many forms would become extinct. These extinct\r\nforms, and those surviving (whether or not modified and changed in\r\nstructure), will all be related in each continent in the same manner and\r\ndegree, as are the inhabitants of any two different sub-regions in that\r\nsame continent. I do not mean to say that, for instance, the present\r\nMarsupials of Australia or Edentata and rodents of S. America have\r\ndescended from any one of the few fossils of the same orders which have\r\nbeen discovered in these countries. It is possible that, in a very few\r\ninstances, this may be the case; but generally they must be considered\r\nas merely codescendants of common stocks{416}. I believe in this, from\r\nthe improbability, considering the vast number of species, which (as\r\nexplained in the last chapter) must by our theory have existed, that\r\nthe _comparatively_ few fossils which have been found should chance to\r\nbe the immediate and linear progenitors of those now existing. Recent as\r\nthe yet discovered fossil mammifers of S. America are, who will pretend\r\nto say that very many intermediate forms may not have existed? Moreover,\r\nwe shall see in the ensuing chapter that the very existence of genera\r\nand species can be explained only by a few species of each epoch leaving\r\nmodified successors or new species to a future period; and the more\r\ndistant that future period, the fewer will be the _linear_ heirs of the\r\nformer epoch. As by our theory, all mammifers must have descended from\r\nthe same parent stock, so is it necessary that each land now possessing\r\nterrestrial mammifers shall at some time have been so far united to\r\nother land as to permit the passage of mammifers{417}; and it accords\r\nwith this necessity, that in looking far back into the earth's history\r\nwe find, first changes in the geographical distribution, and secondly a\r\nperiod when the mammiferous forms most distinctive of two of the present\r\nmain divisions of the world were living together{418}.\r\n\r\n     {416} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 341, vi. p. 487.\r\n\r\n     {417} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 396, vi. p. 549.\r\n\r\n     {418} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 340, vi. p. 486.\r\n\r\nI think then I am justified in asserting that most of the above\r\nenumerated and often trivial points in the geographical distribution of\r\npast and present organisms (which points must be viewed by the\r\ncreationists as so many ultimate facts) follow as a simple consequence\r\nof specific forms being mutable and of their being adapted by natural\r\nselection to diverse ends, conjoined with their powers of dispersal, and\r\nthe geologico-geographical changes now in slow progress and which\r\nundoubtedly have taken place. This large class of facts being thus\r\nexplained, far more than counterbalances many separate difficulties and\r\napparent objections in convincing my mind of the truth of this theory of\r\ncommon descent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Improbability of finding fossil forms intermediate between existing\r\nspecies._\r\n\r\nThere is one observation of considerable importance that may be here\r\nintroduced, with regard to the improbability of the chief transitional\r\nforms between any two species being found fossil. With respect to the\r\nfiner shades of transition, I have before remarked that no one has any\r\ncause to expect to trace them in a fossil state, without he be bold\r\nenough to imagine that geologists at a future epoch will be able to\r\ntrace from fossil bones the gradations between the Short-Horns,\r\nHerefordshire, and Alderney breeds of cattle{419}. I have attempted to\r\nshow that rising islands, in process of formation, must be the best\r\nnurseries of new specific forms, and these points are the least\r\nfavourable for the embedment of fossils{420}: I appeal, as evidence, to\r\nthe state of the _numerous_ scattered islands in the several great\r\noceans: how rarely do any sedimentary deposits occur on them; and when\r\npresent they are mere narrow fringes of no great antiquity, which the\r\nsea is generally wearing away and destroying. The cause of this lies in\r\nisolated islands being generally volcanic and rising points; and the\r\neffects of subterranean elevation is to bring up the surrounding\r\nnewly-deposited strata within the destroying action of the coast-waves:\r\nthe strata, deposited at greater distances, and therefore in the depths\r\nof the ocean, will be almost barren of organic remains. These remarks\r\nmay be generalised:--periods of subsidence will always be most\r\nfavourable to an accumulation of great thicknesses of strata, and\r\nconsequently to their long preservation; for without one formation be\r\nprotected by successive strata, it will seldom be preserved to a distant\r\nage, owing to the enormous amount of denudation, which seems to be a\r\ngeneral contingent of time{421}. I may refer, as evidence of this\r\nremark, to the vast amount of subsidence evident in the great pile of\r\nthe European formations, from the Silurian epoch to the end of the\r\nSecondary, and perhaps to even a later period. Periods of elevation on\r\nthe other hand cannot be favourable to the accumulation of strata and\r\ntheir preservation to distant ages, from the circumstance just alluded\r\nto, viz. of elevation tending to bring to the surface the\r\ncircum-littoral strata (always abounding most in fossils) and destroying\r\nthem. The bottom of tracts of deep water (little favourable, however, to\r\nlife) must be excepted from this unfavourable influence of elevation. In\r\nthe quite open ocean, probably no sediment{422} is accumulating, or at a\r\nrate so slow as not to preserve fossil remains, which will always be\r\nsubject to disintegration. Caverns, no doubt, will be equally likely to\r\npreserve terrestrial fossils in periods of elevation and of subsidence;\r\nbut whether it be owing to the enormous amount of denudation, which all\r\nland seems to have undergone, no cavern with fossil bones has been found\r\nbelonging to the Secondary period{423}.\r\n\r\n     {419} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 299, vi. p. 437.\r\n\r\n     {420} \"Nature may almost be said to have guarded against the\r\n     frequent discovery of her transitional or linking forms,\" _Origin_,\r\n     Ed. i. p. 292. A similar but not identical passage occurs in\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. vi. p. 428.\r\n\r\n     {421} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 291, vi. p. 426.\r\n\r\n     {422} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 288, vi. p. 422.\r\n\r\n     {423} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 289, vi. p. 423.\r\n\r\nHence many more remains will be preserved to a distant age, in any\r\nregion of the world, during periods of its subsidence{424}, than of its\r\nelevation.\r\n\r\n     {424} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 300, vi. p. 439.\r\n\r\nBut during the subsidence of a tract of land, its inhabitants (as before\r\nshown) will from the decrease of space and of the diversity of its\r\nstations, and from the land being fully preoccupied by species fitted to\r\ndiversified means of subsistence, be little liable to modification from\r\nselection, although many may, or rather must, become extinct. With\r\nrespect to its circum-marine inhabitants, although during a change from\r\na continent to a _great_ archipelago, the number of stations fitted for\r\nmarine beings will be increased, their means of diffusion (an important\r\ncheck to change of form) will be greatly improved; for a continent\r\nstretching north and south, or a quite open space of ocean, seems to be\r\nto them the only barrier. On the other hand, during the elevation of a\r\nsmall archipelago and its conversion into a continent, we have, whilst\r\nthe number of stations are increasing, both for aquatic and terrestrial\r\nproductions, and whilst these stations are not fully preoccupied by\r\nperfectly adapted species, the most favourable conditions for the\r\nselection of new specific forms; but few of them in their early\r\ntransitional states will be preserved to a distant epoch. We must wait\r\nduring an enormous lapse of time, until long-continued subsidence shall\r\nhave taken the place in this quarter of the world of the elevatory\r\nprocess, for the best conditions of the embedment and the preservation\r\nof its inhabitants. Generally the great mass of the strata in every\r\ncountry, from having been chiefly accumulated during subsidence, will be\r\nthe tomb, not of transitional forms, but of those either becoming\r\nextinct or remaining unmodified.\r\n\r\nThe state of our knowledge, and the slowness of the changes of level, do\r\nnot permit us to test the truth of these remarks, by observing whether\r\nthere are more transitional or \"fine\" (as naturalists would term them)\r\nspecies, on a rising and enlarging tract of land, than on an area of\r\nsubsidence. Nor do I know whether there are more \"fine\" species on\r\nisolated volcanic islands in process of formation, than on a continent;\r\nbut I may remark, that at the Galapagos Archipelago the number of forms,\r\nwhich according to some naturalists are true species, and according to\r\nothers are mere races, is considerable: this particularly applies to the\r\ndifferent species or races of the same genera inhabiting the different\r\nislands of this archipelago. Furthermore it may be added (as bearing on\r\nthe great facts discussed in this chapter) that when naturalists confine\r\ntheir attention to any one country, they have comparatively little\r\ndifficulty in determining what forms to call species and what to call\r\nvarieties; that is, those which can or cannot be traced or shown to be\r\nprobably descendants of some other form: but the difficulty increases,\r\nas species are brought from many stations, countries and islands. It was\r\nthis increasing (but I believe in few cases insuperable) difficulty\r\nwhich seems chiefly to have urged Lamarck to the conclusion that species\r\nare mutable.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII\r\n\r\nON THE NATURE OF THE AFFINITIES AND CLASSIFICATION OF ORGANIC\r\nBEINGS{425}\r\n\r\n     {425} Ch. XIII of the _Origin_, Ed. i., Ch. XIV Ed. vi. begins with\r\n     a similar statement. In the present Essay the author adds a\r\n     note:--\"The obviousness of the fact (_i.e._ the natural grouping of\r\n     organisms) alone prevents it being remarkable. It is scarcely\r\n     explicable by creationist: groups of aquatic, of vegetable feeders\r\n     and carnivorous, &c., might resemble each other; but why as it is.\r\n     So with plants,--analogical resemblance thus accounted for. Must\r\n     not here enter into details.\" This argument is incorporated with\r\n     the text in the _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Gradual appearance and disappearance of groups._\r\n\r\nIt has been observed from the earliest times that organic beings fall\r\ninto groups{426}, and these groups into others of several values, such\r\nas species into genera, and then into sub-families, into families,\r\norders, &c. The same fact holds with those beings which no longer exist.\r\nGroups of species seem to follow the same laws in their appearance and\r\nextinction{427}, as do the individuals of any one species: we have\r\nreason to believe that, first, a few species appear, that their numbers\r\nincrease; and that, when tending to extinction, the numbers of the\r\nspecies decrease, till finally the group becomes extinct, in the same\r\nway as a species becomes extinct, by the individuals becoming rarer and\r\nrarer. Moreover, groups, like the individuals of a species, appear to\r\nbecome extinct at different times in different countries. The\r\nPalæotherium was extinct much sooner in Europe than in India: the\r\nTrigonia{428} was extinct in early ages in Europe, but now lives in the\r\nseas of Australia. As it happens that one species of a family will\r\nendure for a much longer period than another species, so we find that\r\nsome whole groups, such as Mollusca, tend to retain their forms, or to\r\nremain persistent, for longer periods than other groups, for instance\r\nthan the Mammalia. Groups therefore, in their appearance, extinction,\r\nand rate of change or succession, seem to follow nearly the same laws\r\nwith the individuals of a species{429}.\r\n\r\n     {426} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 411, vi. p. 566.\r\n\r\n     {427} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 316, vi. p. 457.\r\n\r\n     {428} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 321, vi. p. 463.\r\n\r\n     {429} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. this preliminary matter is replaced\r\n     (pp. 411, 412, vi. pp. 566, 567) by a discussion in which\r\n     extinction is also treated, but chiefly from the point of view of\r\n     the theory of divergence.\r\n\r\n\r\n_What is the Natural System?_\r\n\r\nThe proper arrangement of species into groups, according to the natural\r\nsystem, is the object of all naturalists; but scarcely two naturalists\r\nwill give the same answer to the question, What is the natural system\r\nand how are we to recognise it? The most important characters{430} it\r\nmight be thought (as it was by the earliest classifiers) ought to be\r\ndrawn from those parts of the structure which determine its habits and\r\nplace in the economy of nature, which we may call the final end of its\r\nexistence. But nothing is further from the truth than this; how much\r\nexternal resemblance there is between the little otter (Chironectes) of\r\nGuiana and the common otter; or again between the common swallow and the\r\nswift; and who can doubt that the means and ends of their existence are\r\nclosely similar, yet how grossly wrong would be the classification,\r\nwhich put close to each other a Marsupial and Placental animal, and two\r\nbirds with widely different skeletons. Relations, such as in the two\r\nlatter cases, or as that between the whale and fishes, are denominated\r\n\"analogical{431},\" or are sometimes described as \"relations of\r\nadaption.\" They are infinitely numerous and often very singular; but are\r\nof no use in the classification of the higher groups. How it comes, that\r\ncertain parts of the structure, by which the habits and functions of the\r\nspecies are settled, are of no use in classification, whilst other\r\nparts, formed at the same time, are of the greatest, it would be\r\ndifficult to say, on the theory of separate creations.\r\n\r\n     {430} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 414, vi. p. 570.\r\n\r\n     {431} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 414, vi. p. 570.\r\n\r\nSome authors as Lamarck, Whewell &c., believe that the degree of\r\naffinity on the natural system depends on the degrees of resemblance in\r\norgans more or less physiologically important for the preservation of\r\nlife. This scale of importance in the organs is admitted to be of\r\ndifficult discovery. But quite independent of this, the proposition, as\r\na general rule, must be rejected as false; though it may be partially\r\ntrue. For it is universally admitted that the same part or organ, which\r\nis of the highest service in classification in one group, is of very\r\nlittle use in another group, though in both groups, as far as we can\r\nsee, the part or organ is of equal physiological importance: moreover,\r\ncharacters quite unimportant physiologically, such as whether the\r\ncovering of the body consists of hair or feathers, whether the nostrils\r\ncommunicated with the mouth{432} &c., &c., are of the highest generality\r\nin classification; even colour, which is so inconstant in many species,\r\nwill sometimes well characterise even a whole group of species. Lastly,\r\nthe fact, that no one character is of so much importance in determining\r\nto what great group an organism belongs, as the forms through which the\r\nembryo{433} passes from the germ upwards to maturity, cannot be\r\nreconciled with the idea that natural classification follows according\r\nto the degrees of resemblance in the parts of most physiological\r\nimportance. The affinity of the common rock-barnacle with the\r\nCrustaceans can hardly be perceived in more than a single character in\r\nits mature state, but whilst young, locomotive, and furnished with eyes,\r\nits affinity cannot be mistaken{434}. The cause of the greater value of\r\ncharacters, drawn from the early stages of life, can, as we shall in a\r\nsucceeding chapter see, be in a considerable degree explained, on the\r\ntheory of descent, although inexplicable on the views of the\r\ncreationist.\r\n\r\n     {432} These instances occur with others in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p.\r\n     416, vi. p. 572.\r\n\r\n     {433} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 418, vi. p. 574.\r\n\r\n     {434} _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 419, 440, vi. pp. 575, 606.\r\n\r\nPractically, naturalists seem to classify according to the resemblance\r\nof those parts or organs which in related groups are most uniform, or\r\nvary least{435}: thus the æstivation, or manner in which the petals etc.\r\nare folded over each other, is found to afford an unvarying character in\r\nmost families of plants, and accordingly any difference in this respect\r\nwould be sufficient to cause the rejection of a species from many\r\nfamilies; but in the Rubiaceæ the æstivation is a varying character, and\r\na botanist would not lay much stress on it, in deciding whether or not\r\nto class a new species in this family. But this rule is obviously so\r\narbitrary a formula, that most naturalists seem to be convinced that\r\nsomething ulterior is represented by the natural system; they appear to\r\nthink that we only discover by such similarities what the arrangement of\r\nthe system is, not that such similarities make the system. We can only\r\nthus understand Linnæus'{436} well-known saying, that the characters do\r\nnot make the genus; but that the genus gives the characters: for a\r\nclassification, independent of characters, is here presupposed. Hence\r\nmany naturalists have said that the natural system reveals the plan of\r\nthe Creator: but without it be specified whether order in time or place,\r\nor what else is meant by the plan of the Creator, such expressions\r\nappear to me to leave the question exactly where it was.\r\n\r\n     {435} _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 418, 425, vi. pp. 574, 581.\r\n\r\n     {436} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 413, vi. p. 569.\r\n\r\nSome naturalists consider that the geographical position{437} of a\r\nspecies may enter into the consideration of the group into which it\r\nshould be placed; and most naturalists (either tacitly or openly) give\r\nvalue to the different groups, not solely by their relative differences\r\nin structure, but by the number of forms included in them. Thus a genus\r\ncontaining a few species might be, and has often been, raised into a\r\nfamily on the discovery of several other species. Many natural families\r\nare retained, although most closely related to other families, from\r\nincluding a great number of closely similar species. The more logical\r\nnaturalist would perhaps, if he could, reject these two contingents in\r\nclassification. From these circumstances, and especially from the\r\nundefined objects and criterions of the natural system, the number of\r\ndivisions, such as genera, sub-families, families, &c., &c., has been\r\nquite arbitrary{438}; without the clearest definition, how can it be\r\npossible to decide whether two groups of species are of equal value, and\r\nof what value? whether they should both be called genera or families; or\r\nwhether one should be a genus, and the other a family{439}?\r\n\r\n     {437} _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 419, 427, vi. pp. 575, 582.\r\n\r\n     {438} This is discussed from the point of view of divergence in the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 420, 421, vi. pp. 576, 577.\r\n\r\n     {439} <Footnote by the author.> I discuss this because if Quinarism\r\n     true, I false. <The Quinary System is set forth in W. S. Macleay's\r\n     _Horæ Entomologicæ_, 1821.>\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the kind of relation between distinct groups._\r\n\r\nI have only one other remark on the affinities of organic beings; that\r\nis, when two quite distinct groups approach each other, the approach is\r\n_generally_ generic{440} and not special; I can explain this most easily\r\nby an example: of all Rodents the Bizcacha, by certain peculiarities in\r\nits reproductive system, approaches nearest to the Marsupials; of all\r\nMarsupials the Phascolomys, on the other hand, appears to approach in\r\nthe form of its teeth and intestines nearest to the Rodents; but there\r\nis no special relation between these two genera{441}; the Bizcacha is no\r\nnearer related to the Phascolomys than to any other Marsupial in the\r\npoints in which it approaches this division; nor again is the\r\nPhascolomys, in the points of structure in which it approaches the\r\nRodents, any nearer related to the Bizcacha than to any other Rodent.\r\nOther examples might have been chosen, but I have given (from\r\nWaterhouse) this example as it illustrates another point, namely, the\r\ndifficulty of determining what are analogical or adaptive and what real\r\naffinities; it seems that the teeth of the Phascolomys though _appearing\r\nclosely_ to resemble those of a Rodent are found to be built on the\r\nMarsupial type; and it is thought that these teeth and consequently the\r\nintestines may have been adapted to the peculiar life of this animal and\r\ntherefore may not show any real relation. The structure in the Bizcacha\r\nthat connects it with the Marsupials does not seem a peculiarity related\r\nto its manner of life, and I imagine that no one would doubt that this\r\nshows a real affinity, though not more with any one Marsupial species\r\nthan with another. The difficulty of determining what relations are real\r\nand what analogical is far from surprising when no one pretends to\r\ndefine the meaning of the term relation or the ulterior object of all\r\nclassification. We shall immediately see on the theory of descent how it\r\ncomes that there should be \"real\" and \"analogical\" affinities; and why\r\nthe former alone should be of value in classification--difficulties\r\nwhich it would be I believe impossible to explain on the ordinary theory\r\nof separate creations.\r\n\r\n     {440} In the corresponding passage in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 430,\r\n     vi. p. 591, the term _general_ is used in place of _generic_, and\r\n     seems a better expression. In the margin the author gives\r\n     Waterhouse as his authority.\r\n\r\n     {441} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 430, vi. p. 591.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification of Races or Varieties._\r\n\r\nLet us now for a few moments turn to the classification of the generally\r\nacknowledged varieties and subdivisions of our domestic beings{442}; we\r\nshall find them systematically arranged in groups of higher and higher\r\nvalue. De Candolle has treated the varieties of the cabbage exactly as\r\nhe would have done a natural family with various divisions and\r\nsubdivisions. In dogs again we have one main division which may be\r\ncalled the _family_ of hounds; of these, there are several (we will call\r\nthem) _genera_, such as blood-hounds, fox-hounds, and harriers; and of\r\neach of these we have different _species_, as the blood-hound of Cuba\r\nand that of England; and of the latter again we have breeds truly\r\nproducing their own kind, which may be called races or varieties. Here\r\nwe see a classification practically used which typifies on a lesser\r\nscale that which holds good in nature. But amongst true species in the\r\nnatural system and amongst domestic races the number of divisions or\r\ngroups, instituted between those most alike and those most unlike, seems\r\nto be quite arbitrary. The number of the forms in both cases seems\r\npractically, whether or not it ought theoretically, to influence the\r\ndenomination of groups including them. In both, geographical\r\ndistribution has sometimes been used as an aid to classification{443};\r\namongst varieties, I may instance, the cattle of India or the sheep of\r\nSiberia, which from possessing some characters in common permit a\r\nclassification of Indian and European cattle, or Siberian and European\r\nsheep. Amongst domestic varieties we have even something very like the\r\nrelations of \"analogy\" or \"adaptation{444}\"; thus the common and Swedish\r\nturnip are both artificial varieties which strikingly resemble each\r\nother, and they fill nearly the same end in the economy of the\r\nfarm-yard; but although the swede so much more resembles a turnip than\r\nits presumed parent the field cabbage, no one thinks of putting it out\r\nof the cabbages into the turnips. Thus the greyhound and racehorse,\r\nhaving been selected and trained for extreme fleetness for short\r\ndistances, present an analogical resemblance of the same kind, but less\r\nstriking as that between the little otter (Marsupial) of Guiana and the\r\ncommon otter; though these two otters are really less related than <are>\r\nthe horse and dog. We are even cautioned by authors treating on\r\nvarieties, to follow the _natural_ in contradistinction of an artificial\r\nsystem and not, for instance, to class two varieties of the\r\npine-apple{445} near each other, because their fruits accidentally\r\nresemble each other closely (though the fruit may be called _the final\r\nend_ of this plant in the economy of its world, the hothouse), but to\r\njudge from the general resemblance of the entire plants. Lastly,\r\nvarieties often become extinct; sometimes from unexplained causes,\r\nsometimes from accident, but more often from the production of more\r\nuseful varieties, and the less useful ones being destroyed or bred out.\r\n\r\n     {442} In a corresponding passage in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 423,\r\n     vi. p. 579, the author makes use of his knowledge of pigeons. The\r\n     pseudo-genera among dogs are discussed in _Var. under Dom._, Ed.\r\n     ii. vol. I. p. 38.\r\n\r\n     {443} _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 419, 427, vi. pp. 575, 582.\r\n\r\n     {444} _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 423, 427, vi. pp. 579, 583.\r\n\r\n     {445} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 423, vi. p. 579.\r\n\r\nI think it cannot be doubted that the main cause of all the varieties\r\nwhich have descended from the aboriginal dog or dogs, or from the\r\naboriginal wild cabbage, not being equally like or unlike--but on the\r\ncontrary, obviously falling into groups and sub-groups--must in chief\r\npart be attributed to different degrees of true relationship; for\r\ninstance, that the different kinds of blood-hound have descended from\r\none stock, whilst the harriers have descended from another stock, and\r\nthat both these have descended from a different stock from that which\r\nhas been the parent of the several kinds of greyhound. We often hear of\r\na florist having some choice variety and breeding from it a whole group\r\nof sub-varieties more or less characterised by the peculiarities of the\r\nparent. The case of the peach and nectarine, each with their many\r\nvarieties, might have been introduced. No doubt the relationship of our\r\ndifferent domestic breeds has been obscured in an extreme degree by\r\ntheir crossing; and likewise from the slight difference between many\r\nbreeds it has probably often happened that a \"sport\" from one breed has\r\nless closely resembled its parent breed than some other breed, and has\r\ntherefore been classed with the latter. Moreover the effects of a\r\nsimilar climate{446} may in some cases have more than counterbalanced\r\nthe similarity, consequent on a common descent, though I should think\r\nthe similarity of the breeds of cattle of India or sheep of Siberia was\r\nfar more probably due to the community of their descent than to the\r\neffects of climate on animals descended from different stocks.\r\n\r\n     {446} A general statement of the influence of conditions on\r\n     variation occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 131-3, vi. pp. 164-5.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these great sources of difficulty, I apprehend every\r\none would admit, that if it were possible, a genealogical classification\r\nof our domestic varieties would be the most satisfactory one; and as far\r\nas varieties were concerned would be the natural system: in some cases\r\nit has been followed. In attempting to follow out this object a person\r\nwould have to class a variety, whose parentage he did not know, by its\r\nexternal characters; but he would have a distinct ulterior object in\r\nview, namely, its descent in the same manner as a regular systematist\r\nseems also to have an ulterior but undefined end in all his\r\nclassifications. Like the regular systematist he would not care whether\r\nhis characters were drawn from more or less important organs as long as\r\nhe found in the tribe which he was examining that the characters from\r\nsuch parts were persistent; thus amongst cattle he does value a\r\ncharacter drawn from the form of the horns more than from the\r\nproportions of the limbs and whole body, for he finds that the shape of\r\nthe horns is to a considerable degree persistent amongst cattle{447},\r\nwhilst the bones of the limbs and body vary. No doubt as a frequent rule\r\nthe more important the organ, as being less related to external\r\ninfluences, the less liable it is to variation; but he would expect that\r\naccording to the object for which the races had been selected, parts\r\nmore or less important might differ; so that characters drawn from parts\r\ngenerally most liable to vary, as colour, might in some instances be\r\nhighly serviceable--as is the case. He would admit that general\r\nresemblances scarcely definable by language might sometimes serve to\r\nallocate a species by its nearest relation. He would be able to assign a\r\nclear reason why the close similarity of the fruit in two varieties of\r\npine-apple, and of the so-called root in the common and Swedish turnips,\r\nand why the similar gracefulness of form in the greyhound and\r\nracehorse, are characters of little value in classification; namely,\r\nbecause they are the result, not of community of descent, but either of\r\nselection for a common end, or of the effects of similar external\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\n     {447} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 423, vi. p. 579. In the margin Marshall\r\n     is given as the authority.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Classification of \"races\" and species similar._\r\n\r\nThus seeing that both the classifiers of species and of varieties{448}\r\nwork by the same means, make similar distinctions in the value of the\r\ncharacters, and meet with similar difficulties, and that both seem to\r\nhave in their classification an ulterior object in view; I cannot avoid\r\nstrongly suspecting that the same cause, which has made amongst our\r\ndomestic varieties groups and sub-groups, has made similar groups (but\r\nof higher values) amongst species; and that this cause is the greater or\r\nless propinquity of actual descent. The simple fact of species, both\r\nthose long since extinct and those now living, being divisible into\r\ngenera, families, orders &c.--divisions analogous to those into which\r\nvarieties are divisible--is otherwise an inexplicable fact, and only not\r\nremarkable from its familiarity.\r\n\r\n     {448} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 423, vi. p. 579.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Origin of genera and families._\r\n\r\nLet us suppose{449} for example that a species spreads and arrives at\r\nsix or more different regions, or being already diffused over one wide\r\narea, let this area be divided into six distinct regions, exposed to\r\ndifferent conditions, and with stations slightly different, not fully\r\noccupied with other species, so that six different races or species\r\nwere formed by selection, each best fitted to its new habits and\r\nstation. I must remark that in every case, if a species becomes modified\r\nin any one sub-region, it is probable that it will become modified in\r\nsome other of the sub-regions over which it is diffused, for its\r\norganization is shown to be capable of being rendered plastic; its\r\ndiffusion proves that it is able to struggle with the other inhabitants\r\nof the several sub-regions; and as the organic beings of every great\r\nregion are in some degree allied, and as even the physical conditions\r\nare often in some respects alike, we might expect that a modification in\r\nstructure, which gave our species some advantage over antagonist species\r\nin one sub-region, would be followed by other modifications in other of\r\nthe sub-regions. The races or new species supposed to be formed would be\r\nclosely related to each other; and would either form a new genus or\r\nsub-genus, or would rank (probably forming a slightly different section)\r\nin the genus to which the parent species belonged. In the course of\r\nages, and during the contingent physical changes, it is probable that\r\nsome of the six new species would be destroyed; but the same advantage,\r\nwhatever it may have been (whether mere tendency to vary, or some\r\npeculiarity of organization, power of mind, or means of distribution),\r\nwhich in the parent-species and in its six selected and changed\r\nspecies-offspring, caused them to prevail over other antagonist species,\r\nwould generally tend to preserve some or many of them for a long period.\r\nIf then, two or three of the six species were preserved, they in their\r\nturn would, during continued changes, give rise to as many small groups\r\nof species: if the parents of these small groups were closely similar,\r\nthe new species would form one great genus, barely perhaps divisible\r\ninto two or three sections: but if the parents were considerably\r\nunlike, their species-offspring would, from inheriting most of the\r\npeculiarities of their parent-stocks, form either two or more sub-genera\r\nor (if the course of selection tended in different ways) genera. And\r\nlastly species descending from different species of the newly formed\r\ngenera would form new genera, and such genera collectively would form a\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\n     {449} The discussion here following corresponds more or less to the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 411, 412, vi. pp. 566, 567; although the\r\n     doctrine of divergence is not mentioned in this Essay (as it is in\r\n     the _Origin_) yet the present section seems to me a distinct\r\n     approximation to it.\r\n\r\nThe extermination of species follows from changes in the external\r\nconditions, and from the increase or immigration of more favoured\r\nspecies: and as those species which are undergoing modification in any\r\none great region (or indeed over the world) will very often be allied\r\nones from (as just explained) partaking of many characters, and\r\ntherefore advantages in common, so the species, whose place the new or\r\nmore favoured ones are seizing, from partaking of a common inferiority\r\n(whether in any particular point of structure, or of general powers of\r\nmind, of means of distribution, of capacity for variation, &c., &c.),\r\nwill be apt to be allied. Consequently species of the same genus will\r\nslowly, one after the other, _tend_ to become rarer and rarer in\r\nnumbers, and finally extinct; and as each last species of several allied\r\ngenera fails, even the family will become extinct. There may of course\r\nbe occasional exceptions to the entire destruction of any genus or\r\nfamily. From what has gone before, we have seen that the slow and\r\nsuccessive formation of several new species from the same stock will\r\nmake a new genus, and the slow and successive formation of several other\r\nnew species from another stock will make another genus; and if these two\r\nstocks were allied, such genera will make a new family. Now, as far as\r\nour knowledge serves, it is in this slow and gradual manner that groups\r\nof species appear on, and disappear from, the face of the earth.\r\n\r\nThe manner in which, according to our theory, the arrangement of species\r\nin groups is due to partial extinction, will perhaps be rendered clearer\r\nin the following way. Let us suppose in any one great class, for\r\ninstance in the Mammalia, that every species and every variety, during\r\neach successive age, had sent down one unaltered descendant (either\r\nfossil or living) to the present time; we should then have had one\r\nenormous series, including by small gradations every known mammiferous\r\nform; and consequently the existence of groups{450}, or chasms in the\r\nseries, which in some parts are in greater width, and in some of less,\r\nis solely due to former species, and whole groups of species, not having\r\nthus sent down descendants to the present time.\r\n\r\n     {450} The author probably intended to write \"groups separated by\r\n     chasms.\"\r\n\r\nWith respect to the \"analogical\" or \"adaptive\" resemblances between\r\norganic beings which are not really related{451}, I will only add, that\r\nprobably the isolation of different groups of species is an important\r\nelement in the production of such characters: thus we can easily see, in\r\na large increasing island, or even a continent like Australia, stocked\r\nwith only certain orders of the main classes, that the conditions would\r\nbe highly favourable for species from these orders to become adapted to\r\nplay parts in the economy of nature, which in other countries were\r\nperformed by tribes especially adapted to such parts. We can understand\r\nhow it might happen that an otter-like animal might have been formed in\r\nAustralia by slow selection from the more carnivorous Marsupial types;\r\nthus we can understand that curious case in the southern hemisphere,\r\nwhere there are no auks (but many petrels), of a petrel{452} having been\r\nmodified into the external general form so as to play the same office\r\nin nature with the auks of the northern hemisphere; although the habits\r\nand form of the petrels and auks are normally so wholly different. It\r\nfollows, from our theory, that two orders must have descended from one\r\ncommon stock at an immensely remote epoch; and we can perceive when a\r\nspecies in either order, or in both, shows some affinity to the other\r\norder, why the affinity is usually generic and not particular--that is\r\nwhy the Bizcacha amongst Rodents, in the points in which it is related\r\nto the Marsupial, is related to the whole group{453}, and not\r\nparticularly to the Phascolomys, which of all Marsupialia is related\r\nmost to the Rodents. For the Bizcacha is related to the present\r\nMarsupialia, only from being related to their common parent-stock; and\r\nnot to any one species in particular. And generally, it may be observed\r\nin the writings of most naturalists, that when an organism is described\r\nas intermediate between two _great_ groups, its relations are not to\r\nparticular species of either group, but to both groups, as wholes. A\r\nlittle reflection will show how exceptions (as that of the Lepidosiren,\r\na fish closely related to _particular_ reptiles) might occur, namely\r\nfrom a few descendants of those species, which at a very early period\r\nbranched out from a common parent-stock and so formed the two orders or\r\ngroups, having survived, in nearly their original state, to the present\r\ntime.\r\n\r\n     {451} A similar discussion occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 427,\r\n     vi. p. 582.\r\n\r\n     {452} _Puffinuria berardi_, see _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 184, vi. p.\r\n     221.\r\n\r\n     {453} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 430, vi. p. 591.\r\n\r\nFinally, then, we see that all the leading facts in the affinities and\r\nclassification of organic beings can be explained on the theory of the\r\nnatural system being simply a genealogical one. The similarity of the\r\nprinciples in classifying domestic varieties and true species, both\r\nthose living and extinct, is at once explained; the rules followed and\r\ndifficulties met with being the same. The existence of genera, families,\r\norders, &c., and their mutual relations, naturally ensues from\r\nextinction going on at all periods amongst the diverging descendants of\r\na common stock. These terms of affinity, relations, families, adaptive\r\ncharacters, &c., which naturalists cannot avoid using, though\r\nmetaphorically, cease being so, and are full of plain signification.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII\r\n\r\nUNITY OF TYPE IN THE GREAT CLASSES; AND MORPHOLOGICAL STRUCTURES\r\n\r\n\r\n_Unity of Type_{454}.\r\n\r\n     {454} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 434, vi. p. 595. Ch. VIII corresponds to\r\n     a section of Ch. XIII in the _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n\r\nScarcely anything is more wonderful or has been oftener insisted on than\r\nthat the organic beings in each great class, though living in the most\r\ndistant climes and at periods immensely remote, though fitted to widely\r\ndifferent ends in the economy of nature, yet all in their internal\r\nstructure evince an obvious uniformity. What, for instance, is more\r\nwonderful than that the hand to clasp, the foot or hoof to walk, the\r\nbat's wing to fly, the porpoise's fin{455} to swim, should all be built\r\non the same plan? and that the bones in their position and number should\r\nbe so similar that they can all be classed and called by the same names.\r\nOccasionally some of the bones are merely represented by an apparently\r\nuseless, smooth style, or are soldered closely to other bones, but the\r\nunity of type is not by this destroyed, and hardly rendered less clear.\r\nWe see in this fact some deep bond of union between the organic beings\r\nof the same great classes--to illustrate which is the object and\r\nfoundation of the natural system. The perception of this bond, I may\r\nadd, is the evident cause that naturalists make an ill-defined\r\ndistinction between true and adaptive affinities.\r\n\r\n     {455} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 434, vi. p. 596. In the _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     these examples occur under the heading _Morphology_; the author\r\n     does not there draw much distinction between this heading and that\r\n     of _Unity of Type_.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Morphology._\r\n\r\nThere is another allied or rather almost identical class of facts\r\nadmitted by the least visionary naturalists and included under the name\r\nof Morphology. These facts show that in an individual organic being,\r\nseveral of its organs consist of some other organ metamorphosed{456}:\r\nthus the sepals, petals, stamens, pistils, &c. of every plant can be\r\nshown to be metamorphosed leaves; and thus not only can the number,\r\nposition and transitional states of these several organs, but likewise\r\ntheir monstrous changes, be most lucidly explained. It is believed that\r\nthe same laws hold good with the gemmiferous vesicles of Zoophytes. In\r\nthe same manner the number and position of the extraordinarily\r\ncomplicated jaws and palpi of Crustacea and of insects, and likewise\r\ntheir differences in the different groups, all become simple, on the\r\nview of these parts, or rather legs and all metamorphosed appendages,\r\nbeing metamorphosed legs. The skulls, again, of the Vertebrata are\r\ncomposed of three metamorphosed vertebræ, and thus we can see a meaning\r\nin the number and strange complication of the bony case of the brain. In\r\nthis latter instance, and in that of the jaws of the Crustacea, it is\r\nonly necessary to see a series taken from the different groups of each\r\nclass to admit the truth of these views. It is evident that when in each\r\nspecies of a group its organs consist of some other part metamorphosed,\r\nthat there must also be a \"unity of type\" in such a group. And in the\r\ncases as that above given in which the foot, hand, wing and paddle are\r\nsaid to be constructed on a uniform type, if we could perceive in such\r\nparts or organs traces of an apparent change from some other use or\r\nfunction, we should strictly include such parts or organs in the\r\ndepartment of morphology: thus if we could trace in the limbs of the\r\nVertebrata, as we can in their ribs, traces of an apparent change from\r\nbeing processes of the vertebræ, it would be said that in each species\r\nof the Vertebrata the limbs were \"metamorphosed spinal processes,\" and\r\nthat in all the species throughout the class the limbs displayed a\r\n\"unity of type{457}.\"\r\n\r\n     {456} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 436, vi. p. 599, where the parts of\r\n     the flower, the jaws and palpi of Crustaceans and the vertebrate\r\n     skull are given as examples.\r\n\r\n     {457} The author here brings _Unity of Type_ and _Morphology_\r\n     together.\r\n\r\nThese wonderful parts of the hoof, foot, hand, wing, paddle, both in\r\nliving and extinct animals, being all constructed on the same framework,\r\nand again of the petals, stamina, germens, &c. being metamorphosed\r\nleaves, can by the creationist be viewed only as ultimate facts and\r\nincapable of explanation; whilst on our theory of descent these facts\r\nall necessary follow: for by this theory all the beings of any one\r\nclass, say of the mammalia, are supposed to be descended from one\r\nparent-stock, and to have been altered by such slight steps as man\r\neffects by the selection of chance domestic variations. Now we can see\r\naccording to this view that a foot might be selected with longer and\r\nlonger bones, and wider connecting membranes, till it became a swimming\r\norgan, and so on till it became an organ by which to flap along the\r\nsurface or to glide over it, and lastly to fly through the air: but in\r\nsuch changes there would be no tendency to alter the framework of the\r\ninternal inherited structure. Parts might become lost (as the tail in\r\ndogs, or horns in cattle, or the pistils in plants), others might become\r\nunited together (as in the feet of the Lincolnshire breed of pigs{458},\r\nand in the stamens of many garden flowers); parts of a similar nature\r\nmight become increased in number (as the vertebræ in the tails of pigs,\r\n&c., &c. and the fingers and toes in six-fingered races of men and in\r\nthe Dorking fowls), but analogous differences are observed in nature and\r\nare not considered by naturalists to destroy the uniformity of the\r\ntypes. We can, however, conceive such changes to be carried to such\r\nlength that the unity of type might be obscured and finally be\r\nundistinguishable, and the paddle of the Plesiosaurus has been advanced\r\nas an instance in which the uniformity of type can hardly be\r\nrecognised{459}. If after long and gradual changes in the structure of\r\nthe co-descendants from any parent stock, evidence (either from\r\nmonstrosities or from a graduated series) could be still detected of the\r\nfunction, which certain parts or organs played in the parent stock,\r\nthese parts or organs might be strictly determined by their former\r\nfunction with the term \"metamorphosed\" appended. Naturalists have used\r\nthis term in the same metaphorical manner as they have been obliged to\r\nuse the terms of affinity and relation; and when they affirm, for\r\ninstance, that the jaws of a crab are metamorphosed legs, so that one\r\ncrab has more legs and fewer jaws than another, they are far from\r\nmeaning that the jaws, either during the life of the individual crab or\r\nof its progenitors, were really legs. By our theory this term assumes\r\nits literal meaning{460}; and this wonderful fact of the complex jaws of\r\nan animal retaining numerous characters, which they would probably have\r\nretained if they had really been metamorphosed during many successive\r\ngenerations from true legs, is simply explained.\r\n\r\n     {458} The solid-hoofed pigs mentioned in _Var. under Dom._, Ed. ii.\r\n     vol. II. p. 424 are not _Lincolnshire pigs_. For other cases see\r\n     Bateson, _Materials for the Study of Variation_, 1894, pp. 387-90.\r\n\r\n     {459} In the margin C. Bell is given as authority, apparently for\r\n     the statement about Plesiosaurus. See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 436, vi.\r\n     p. 598, where the author speaks of the \"general pattern\" being\r\n     obscured in \"extinct gigantic sea lizards.\" In the same place the\r\n     suctorial Entomostraca are added as examples of the difficulty of\r\n     recognising the type.\r\n\r\n     {460} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 438, vi. p. 602.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Embryology_.\r\n\r\nThe unity of type in the great classes is shown in another and very\r\nstriking manner, namely, in the stages through which the embryo passes\r\nin coming to maturity{461}. Thus, for instance, at one period of the\r\nembryo, the wings of the bat, the hand, hoof or foot of the quadruped,\r\nand the fin of the porpoise do not differ, but consist of a simple\r\nundivided bone. At a still earlier period the embryo of the fish, bird,\r\nreptile and mammal all strikingly resemble each other. Let it not be\r\nsupposed this resemblance is only external; for on dissection, the\r\narteries are found to branch out and run in a peculiar course, wholly\r\nunlike that in the full-grown mammal and bird, but much less unlike that\r\nin the full-grown fish, for they run as if to ærate blood by\r\nbranchiæ{462} on the neck, of which even the slit-like orifices can be\r\ndiscerned. How wonderful it is that this structure should be present in\r\nthe embryos of animals about to be developed into such different forms,\r\nand of which two great classes respire only in the air. Moreover, as the\r\nembryo of the mammal is matured in the parent's body, and that of the\r\nbird in an egg in the air, and that of the fish in an egg in the water,\r\nwe cannot believe that this course of the arteries is related to any\r\nexternal conditions. In all shell-fish (Gasteropods) the embryo passes\r\nthrough a state analogous to that of the Pteropodous Mollusca: amongst\r\ninsects again, even the most different ones, as the moth, fly and\r\nbeetle, the crawling larvæ are all closely analogous: amongst the\r\nRadiata, the jelly-fish in its embryonic state resembles a polype, and\r\nin a still earlier state an infusorial animalcule--as does likewise the\r\nembryo of the polype. From the part of the embryo of a mammal, at one\r\nperiod, resembling a fish more than its parent form; from the larvæ of\r\nall orders of insects more resembling the simpler articulate animals\r\nthan their parent insects{463}; and from such other cases as the embryo\r\nof the jelly-fish resembling a polype much nearer than the perfect\r\njelly-fish; it has often been asserted that the higher animal in each\r\nclass passes through the state of a lower animal; for instance, that the\r\nmammal amongst the vertebrata passes through the state of a fish{464}:\r\nbut Müller denies this, and affirms that the young mammal is at no time\r\na fish, as does Owen assert that the embryonic jelly-fish is at no time\r\na polype, but that mammal and fish, jelly-fish and polype pass through\r\nthe same state; the mammal and jelly-fish being only further developed\r\nor changed.\r\n\r\n     {461} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 439, vi. p. 604.\r\n\r\n     {462} The uselessness of the branchial arches in mammalia is\r\n     insisted on in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 440, vi. p. 606.

Thus certain female Epizoic\r\nCrustaceans in their mature state have neither eyes nor any organs of\r\nlocomotion; they consist of a mere sack, with a simple apparatus for\r\ndigestion and procreation; and when once attached to the body of the\r\nfish, on which they prey, they never move again during their whole\r\nlives: in their embryonic condition, on the other hand, they are\r\nfurnished with eyes, and with well articulated limbs, actively swim\r\nabout and seek their proper object to become attached to. The larvæ,\r\nalso, of some moths are as complicated and are more active than the\r\nwingless and limbless females, which never leave their pupa-case, never\r\nfeed and never see the daylight.\r\n\r\n     {465} This corresponds to the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 441, vi. p. 607,\r\n     where, however, the example is taken from the Cirripedes.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Attempt to explain the facts of embryology._\r\n\r\nI think considerable light can be thrown by the theory of descent on\r\nthese wonderful embryological facts which are common in a greater or\r\nless degree to the whole animal kingdom, and in some manner to the\r\nvegetable kingdom: on the fact, for instance, of the arteries in the\r\nembryonic mammal, bird, reptile and fish, running and branching in the\r\nsame courses and nearly in the same manner with the arteries in the\r\nfull-grown fish; on the fact I may add of the high importance to\r\nsystematic naturalists{466} of the characters and resemblances in the\r\nembryonic state, in ascertaining the true position in the natural system\r\nof mature organic beings. The following are the considerations which\r\nthrow light on these curious points.\r\n\r\n     {466} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 449, vi. p. 617.\r\n\r\nIn the economy, we will say of a feline animal{467}, the feline\r\nstructure of the embryo or of the sucking kitten is of quite secondary\r\nimportance to it; hence, if a feline animal varied (assuming for the\r\ntime the possibility of this) and if some place in the economy of\r\nnature favoured the selection of a longer-limbed variety, it would be\r\nquite unimportant to the production by natural selection of a\r\nlong-limbed breed, whether the limbs of the embryo and kitten were\r\nelongated if they _became_ so _as soon_ as the animal had to provide\r\nfood for itself. And if it were found after continued selection and the\r\nproduction of several new breeds from one parent-stock, that the\r\nsuccessive variations had supervened, not very early in the youth or\r\nembryonic life of each breed (and we have just seen that it is quite\r\nunimportant whether it does so or not), then it obviously follows that\r\nthe young or embryos of the several breeds will continue resembling each\r\nother more closely than their adult parents{468}. And again, if two of\r\nthese breeds became each the parent-stock of several other breeds,\r\nforming two genera, the young and embryos of these would still retain a\r\ngreater resemblance to the one original stock than when in an adult\r\nstate. Therefore if it could be shown that the period of the slight\r\nsuccessive variations does not always supervene at a very early period\r\nof life, the greater resemblance or closer unity in type of animals in\r\nthe young than in the full-grown state would be explained. Before\r\npractically{469} endeavouring to discover in our domestic races whether\r\nthe structure or form of the young has or has not changed in an exactly\r\ncorresponding degree with the changes of full-grown animals, it will be\r\nwell to show that it is at least quite _possible_ for the primary\r\ngerminal vesicle to be impressed with a tendency to produce some change\r\non the growing tissues which will not be fully effected till the animal\r\nis advanced in life.\r\n\r\n     {467} This corresponds to the _Origin_, Ed. i. pp. 443-4, vi. p.\r\n     610: the \"feline animal\" is not used to illustrate the\r\n     generalisation, but is so used in the Essay of 1842, p. 42.\r\n\r\n     {468} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 447, vi. p. 613.\r\n\r\n     {469} In the margin is written \"Get young pigeons\"; this was\r\n     afterwards done, and the results are given in the _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     p. 445, vi. p. 612.\r\n\r\nFrom the following peculiarities of structure being inheritable and\r\nappearing only when the animal is full-grown--namely, general size,\r\ntallness (not consequent on the tallness of the infant), fatness either\r\nover the whole body, or local; change of colour in hair and its loss;\r\ndeposition of bony matter on the legs of horses; blindness and deafness,\r\nthat is changes of structure in the eye and ear; gout and consequent\r\ndeposition of chalk-stones; and many other diseases{470}, as of the\r\nheart and brain, &c., &c.; from all such tendencies being I repeat\r\ninheritable, we clearly see that the germinal vesicle is impressed with\r\nsome power which is wonderfully preserved during the production of\r\ninfinitely numerous cells in the ever changing tissues, till the part\r\nultimately to be affected is formed and the time of life arrived at. We\r\nsee this clearly when we select cattle with any peculiarity of their\r\nhorns, or poultry with any peculiarity of their second plumage, for such\r\npeculiarities cannot of course reappear till the animal is mature.\r\nHence, it is certainly _possible_ that the germinal vesicle may be\r\nimpressed with a tendency to produce a long-limbed animal, the full\r\nproportional length of whose limbs shall appear only when the animal is\r\nmature{471}.\r\n\r\n     {470} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. the corresponding passages are at pp.\r\n     8, 13, 443, vi. pp. 8, 15, 610. In the _Origin_, Ed. i. I have not\r\n     found a passage so striking as that which occurs a few lines lower\r\n     \"that the germinal vesicle is impressed with some power which is\r\n     wonderfully preserved, &c.\" In the _Origin_ this _preservation_ is\r\n     rather taken for granted.\r\n\r\n     {471} <In the margin is written> Aborted organs show, perhaps,\r\n     something about period <at> which changes supervene in embryo.\r\n\r\nIn several of the cases just enumerated we know that the first cause of\r\nthe peculiarity, when _not_ inherited, lies in the conditions to which\r\nthe animal is exposed during mature life, thus to a certain extent\r\ngeneral size and fatness, lameness in horses and in a lesser degree\r\nblindness, gout and some other diseases are certainly in some degree\r\ncaused and accelerated by the habits of life, and these peculiarities\r\nwhen transmitted to the offspring of the affected person reappear at a\r\nnearly corresponding time of life. In medical works it is asserted\r\ngenerally that at whatever period an hereditary disease appears in the\r\nparent, it tends to reappear in the offspring at the same period. Again,\r\nwe find that early maturity, the season of reproduction and longevity\r\nare transmitted to corresponding periods of life. Dr Holland has\r\ninsisted much on children of the same family exhibiting certain diseases\r\nin similar and peculiar manners; my father has known three brothers{472}\r\ndie in very old age in a _singular_ comatose state; now to make these\r\nlatter cases strictly bear, the children of such families ought\r\nsimilarly to suffer at corresponding times of life; this is probably not\r\nthe case, but such facts show that a tendency in a disease to appear at\r\nparticular stages of life can be transmitted through the germinal\r\nvesicle to different individuals of the same family. It is then\r\ncertainly possible that diseases affecting widely different periods of\r\nlife can be transmitted. So little attention is paid to very young\r\ndomestic animals that I do not know whether any case is on record of\r\nselected peculiarities in young animals, for instance, in the first\r\nplumage of birds, being transmitted to their young. If, however, we turn\r\nto silk-worms{473}, we find that the caterpillars and coccoons (which\r\nmust correspond to a _very early_ period of the embryonic life of\r\nmammalia) vary, and that these varieties reappear in the offspring\r\ncaterpillars and coccoons.\r\n\r\n     {472} See p. 42, note 5.{Note 160}\r\n\r\n     {473} The evidence is given in _Var. under Dom._, I. p. 316.\r\n\r\nI think these facts are sufficient to render it probable that at\r\nwhatever period of life any peculiarity (capable of being inherited)\r\nappears, whether caused by the action of external influences during\r\nmature life, or from an affection of the primary germinal vesicle, it\r\n_tends_ to reappear in the offspring at the corresponding period of\r\nlife{474}. Hence (I may add) whatever effect training, that is the full\r\nemployment or action of every newly selected slight variation, has in\r\nfully developing and increasing such variation, would only show itself\r\nin mature age, corresponding to the period of training; in the second\r\nchapter I showed that there was in this respect a marked difference in\r\nnatural and artificial selection, man not regularly exercising or\r\nadapting his varieties to new ends, whereas selection by nature\r\npresupposes such exercise and adaptation in each selected and changed\r\npart. The foregoing facts show and presuppose that slight variations\r\noccur at various periods of life _after birth_; the facts of\r\nmonstrosity, on the other hand, show that many changes take place before\r\nbirth, for instance, all such cases as extra fingers, hare-lip and all\r\nsudden and great alterations in structure; and these when inherited\r\nreappear during the embryonic period in the offspring. I will only add\r\nthat at a period even anterior to embryonic life, namely, during the\r\n_egg_ state, varieties appear in size and colour (as with the\r\nHertfordshire duck with blackish eggs{475}) which reappear in the egg;\r\nin plants also the capsule and membranes of the seed are very variable\r\nand inheritable.\r\n\r\n     {474} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 444, vi. p. 610.\r\n\r\n     {475} In _Var. under Dom._, Ed. ii. vol. I. p. 295, such eggs are\r\n     said to be laid early in each season by the black Labrador duck. In\r\n     the next sentence in the text the author does not distinguish the\r\n     characters of the vegetable capsule from those of the ovum.\r\n\r\nIf then the two following propositions are admitted (and I think the\r\nfirst can hardly be doubted), viz. that variation of structure takes\r\nplace at all times of life, though no doubt far less in amount and\r\nseldomer in quite mature life{476} (and then generally taking the form\r\nof disease); and secondly, that these variations tend to reappear at a\r\ncorresponding period of life, which seems at least probable, then we\r\nmight _a priori_ have expected that in any selected breed the _young_\r\nanimal would not partake in a corresponding degree the peculiarities\r\ncharacterising the _full-grown_ parent; though it would in a lesser\r\ndegree. For during the thousand or ten thousand selections of slight\r\nincrements in the length of the limbs of individuals necessary to\r\nproduce a long-limbed breed, we might expect that such increments would\r\ntake place in different individuals (as we do not certainly know at what\r\nperiod they do take place), some earlier and some later in the embryonic\r\nstate, and some during early youth; and these increments would reappear\r\nin their offspring only at corresponding periods. Hence, the entire\r\nlength of limb in the new long-limbed breed would only be acquired at\r\nthe latest period of life, when that one which was latest of the\r\nthousand primary increments of length supervened. Consequently, the\r\nfoetus of the new breed during the earlier part of its existence would\r\nremain much less changed in the proportions of its limbs; and the\r\nearlier the period the less would the change be.\r\n\r\n     {476} This seems to me to be more strongly stated here than in the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n\r\nWhatever may be thought of the facts on which this reasoning is\r\ngrounded, it shows how the embryos and young of different species might\r\ncome to remain less changed than their mature parents; and practically\r\nwe find that the young of our domestic animals, though differing, differ\r\nless than their full-grown parents. Thus if we look at the young\r\npuppies{477} of the greyhound and bulldog--(the two most obviously\r\nmodified of the breeds of dog)--we find their puppies at the age of six\r\ndays with legs and noses (the latter measured from the eyes to the tip)\r\nof the same length; though in the proportional thicknesses and general\r\nappearance of these parts there is a great difference. So it is with\r\ncattle, though the young calves of different breeds are easily\r\nrecognisable, yet they do not differ so much in their proportions as the\r\nfull-grown animals. We see this clearly in the fact that it shows the\r\nhighest skill to select the best forms early in life, either in horses,\r\ncattle or poultry; no one would attempt it only a few hours after birth;\r\nand it requires great discrimination to judge with accuracy even during\r\ntheir full youth, and the best judges are sometimes deceived. This shows\r\nthat the ultimate proportions of the body are not acquired till near\r\nmature age. If I had collected sufficient facts to firmly establish the\r\nproposition that in artificially selected breeds the embryonic and young\r\nanimals are not changed in a corresponding degree with their mature\r\nparents, I might have omitted all the foregoing reasoning and the\r\nattempts to explain how this happens; for we might safely have\r\ntransferred the proposition to the breeds or species naturally selected;\r\nand the ultimate effect would necessarily have been that in a number of\r\nraces or species descended from a common stock and forming several\r\ngenera and families the embryos would have resembled each other more\r\nclosely than full-grown animals. Whatever may have been the form or\r\nhabits of the parent-stock of the Vertebrata, in whatever course the\r\narteries ran and branched, the selection of variations, supervening\r\nafter the first formation of the arteries in the embryo, would not tend\r\nfrom variations supervening at corresponding periods to alter their\r\ncourse at that period: hence, the similar course of the arteries in the\r\nmammal, bird, reptile and fish, must be looked at as a most ancient\r\nrecord of the embryonic structure of the common parent-stock of these\r\nfour great classes.\r\n\r\n     {477} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 444, vi. p. 611.\r\n\r\nA long course of selection might cause a form to become more simple, as\r\nwell as more complicated; thus the adaptation of a crustaceous{478}\r\nanimal to live attached during its whole life to the body of a fish,\r\nmight permit with advantage great simplification of structure, and on\r\nthis view the singular fact of an embryo being more complex than its\r\nparent is at once explained.\r\n\r\n     {478} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 441, vi. p. 607.\r\n\r\n\r\n_On the graduated complexity in each great class._\r\n\r\nI may take this opportunity of remarking that naturalists have observed\r\nthat in most of the great classes a series exists from very complicated\r\nto very simple beings; thus in Fish, what a range there is between the\r\nsand-eel and shark,--in the Articulata, between the common crab and the\r\nDaphnia{479},--between the Aphis and butterfly, and between a mite and a\r\nspider{480}. Now the observation just made, namely, that selection might\r\ntend to simplify, as well as to complicate, explains this; for we can\r\nsee that during the endless geologico-geographical changes, and\r\nconsequent isolation of species, a station occupied in other districts\r\nby less complicated animals might be left unfilled, and be occupied by a\r\ndegraded form of a higher or more complicated class; and it would by no\r\nmeans follow that, when the two regions became united, the degraded\r\norganism would give way to the aboriginally lower organism. According to\r\nour theory, there is obviously no power tending constantly to exalt\r\nspecies, except the mutual struggle between the different individuals\r\nand classes; but from the strong and general hereditary tendency we\r\nmight expect to find some tendency to progressive complication in the\r\nsuccessive production of new organic forms.\r\n\r\n     {479} Compare _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 419, vi. p. 575.\r\n\r\n     {480} <Note in original.> Scarcely possible to distinguish between\r\n     non-development and retrograde development.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Modification by selection of the forms of immature animals._\r\n\r\nI have above remarked that the feline{481} form is quite of secondary\r\nimportance to the embryo and to the kitten. Of course, during any great\r\nand prolonged change of structure in the mature animal, it might, and\r\noften would be, indispensable that the form of the embryo should be\r\nchanged; and this could be effected, owing to the hereditary tendency at\r\ncorresponding ages, by selection, equally well as in mature age: thus if\r\nthe embryo tended to become, or to remain, either over its whole body or\r\nin certain parts, too bulky, the female parent would die or suffer more\r\nduring parturition; and as in the case of the calves with large hinder\r\nquarters{482}, the peculiarity must be either eliminated or the species\r\nbecome extinct. Where an embryonic form has to seek its own food, its\r\nstructure and adaptation is just as important to the species as that of\r\nthe full-grown animal; and as we have seen that a peculiarity appearing\r\nin a caterpillar (or in a child, as shown by the hereditariness of\r\npeculiarities in the milk-teeth) reappears in its offspring, so we can\r\nat once see that our common principle of the selection of slight\r\naccidental variations would modify and adapt a caterpillar to a new or\r\nchanging condition, precisely as in the full-grown butterfly. Hence\r\nprobably it is that caterpillars of different species of the Lepidoptera\r\ndiffer more than those embryos, at a corresponding early period of life,\r\ndo which remain inactive in the womb of their parents. The parent during\r\nsuccessive ages continuing to be adapted by selection for some one\r\nobject, and the larva for quite another one, we need not wonder at the\r\ndifference becoming wonderfully great between them; even as great as\r\nthat between the fixed rock-barnacle and its free, crab-like offspring,\r\nwhich is furnished with eyes and well-articulated, locomotive\r\nlimbs{483}.\r\n\r\n     {481} See p. 42, where the same illustration is used.\r\n\r\n     {482} _Var. under Dom._, Ed. ii. vol. I. p. 452.\r\n\r\n     {483} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 441, vi. p. 607.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Importance of embryology in classification._\r\n\r\nWe are now prepared to perceive why the study of embryonic forms is of\r\nsuch acknowledged importance in classification{484}. For we have seen\r\nthat a variation, supervening at any time, may aid in the modification\r\nand adaptation of the full-grown being; but for the modification of the\r\nembryo, only the variations which supervene at a very early period can\r\nbe seized on and perpetuated by selection: hence there will be less\r\npower and less tendency (for the structure of the embryo is mostly\r\nunimportant) to modify the young: and hence we might expect to find at\r\nthis period similarities preserved between different groups of species\r\nwhich had been obscured and quite lost in the full-grown animals. I\r\nconceive on the view of separate creations it would be impossible to\r\noffer any explanation of the affinities of organic beings thus being\r\nplainest and of the greatest importance at that period of life when\r\ntheir structure is not adapted to the final part they have to play in\r\nthe economy of nature.\r\n\r\n     {484} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 449, vi. p. 617.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Order in time in which the great classes have first appeared._\r\n\r\nIt follows strictly from the above reasoning only that the embryos of\r\n(for instance) existing vertebrata resemble more closely the embryo of\r\nthe parent-stock of this great class than do full-grown existing\r\nvertebrata resemble their full-grown parent-stock. But it may be argued\r\nwith much probability that in the earliest and simplest condition of\r\nthings the parent and embryo must have resembled each other, and that\r\nthe passage of any animal through embryonic states in its growth is\r\nentirely due to subsequent variations affecting _only_ the more mature\r\nperiods of life. If so, the embryos of the existing vertebrata will\r\nshadow forth the full-grown structure of some of those forms of this\r\ngreat class which existed at the earlier periods of the earth's\r\nhistory{485}: and accordingly, animals with a fish-like structure ought\r\nto have preceded birds and mammals; and of fish, that higher organized\r\ndivision with the vertebræ extending into one division of the tail ought\r\nto have preceded the equal-tailed, because the embryos of the latter\r\nhave an unequal tail; and of Crustacea, entomostraca ought to have\r\npreceded the ordinary crabs and barnacles--polypes ought to have\r\npreceded jelly-fish, and infusorial animalcules to have existed before\r\nboth. This order of precedence in time in some of these cases is\r\nbelieved to hold good; but I think our evidence is so exceedingly\r\nincomplete regarding the number and kinds of organisms which have\r\nexisted during all, especially the earlier, periods of the earth's\r\nhistory, that I should put no stress on this accordance, even if it held\r\ntruer than it probably does in our present state of knowledge.\r\n\r\n     {485} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 449, vi. p. 618.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX\r\n\r\nABORTIVE OR RUDIMENTARY ORGANS\r\n\r\n\r\n_The abortive organs of naturalists._\r\n\r\nParts of structure are said to be \"abortive,\" or when in a still lower\r\nstate of development \"rudimentary{486},\" when the same reasoning power,\r\nwhich convinces us that in some cases similar parts are beautifully\r\nadapted to certain ends, declares that in others they are absolutely\r\nuseless. Thus the rhinoceros, the whale{487}, etc., have, when young,\r\nsmall but properly formed teeth, which never protrude from the jaws;\r\ncertain bones, and even the entire extremities are represented by mere\r\nlittle cylinders or points of bone, often soldered to other bones: many\r\nbeetles have exceedingly minute but regularly formed wings lying under\r\ntheir wing-cases{488}, which latter are united never to be opened: many\r\nplants have, instead of stamens, mere filaments or little knobs; petals\r\nare reduced to scales, and whole flowers to buds, which (as in the\r\nfeather hyacinth) never expand. Similar instances are almost\r\ninnumerable, and are justly considered wonderful: probably not one\r\norganic being exists in which some part does not bear the stamp of\r\ninutility; for what can be clearer{489}, as far as our reasoning powers\r\ncan reach, than that teeth are for eating, extremities for locomotion,\r\nwings for flight, stamens and the entire flower for reproduction; yet\r\nfor these clear ends the parts in question are manifestly unfit.\r\nAbortive organs are often said to be mere representatives (a\r\nmetaphorical expression) of similar parts in other organic beings; but\r\nin some cases they are more than representatives, for they seem to be\r\nthe actual organ not fully grown or developed; thus the existence of\r\nmammæ in the male vertebrata is one of the oftenest adduced cases of\r\nabortion; but we know that these organs in man (and in the bull) have\r\nperformed their proper function and secreted milk: the cow has normally\r\nfour mammæ and two abortive ones, but these latter in some instances are\r\nlargely developed and even (??) give milk{490}. Again in flowers, the\r\nrepresentatives of stamens and pistils can be traced to be really these\r\nparts not developed; Kölreuter has shown by crossing a diæcious plant (a\r\nCucubalus) having a rudimentary pistil{491} with another species having\r\nthis organ perfect, that in the hybrid offspring the rudimentary part is\r\nmore developed, though still remaining abortive; now this shows how\r\nintimately related in nature the mere rudiment and the fully developed\r\npistil must be.\r\n\r\n     {486} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 450, vi. p. 619, the author does\r\n     not lay stress on any distinction in meaning between the terms\r\n     _abortive_ and _rudimentary_ organs.\r\n\r\n     {487} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 450, vi. p. 619.\r\n\r\n     {488} _Ibid._\r\n\r\n     {489} This argument occurs in _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 451, vi. p. 619.\r\n\r\n     {490} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 451, vi. p. 619, on male mammæ. In the\r\n     _Origin_ he speaks certainly of the abortive mammæ of the cow\r\n     giving milk,--a point which is here queried.\r\n\r\n     {491} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 451, vi. p. 620.\r\n\r\nAbortive organs, which must be considered as useless as far as their\r\nordinary and normal purpose is concerned, are sometimes adapted to other\r\nends{492}: thus the marsupial bones, which properly serve to support the\r\nyoung in the mother's pouch, are present in the male and serve as the\r\nfulcrum for muscles connected only with male functions: in the male of\r\nthe marigold flower the pistil is abortive for its proper end of being\r\nimpregnated, but serves to sweep the pollen out of the anthers{493}\r\nready to be borne by insects to the perfect pistils in the other\r\nflorets. It is likely in many cases, yet unknown to us, that abortive\r\norgans perform some useful function; but in other cases, for instance in\r\nthat of teeth embedded in the solid jaw-bone, or of mere knobs, the\r\nrudiments of stamens and pistils, the boldest imagination will hardly\r\nventure to ascribe to them any function. Abortive parts, even when\r\nwholly useless to the individual species, are of great signification in\r\nthe system of nature; for they are often found to be of very high\r\nimportance in a natural classification{494}; thus the presence and\r\nposition of entire abortive flowers, in the grasses, cannot be\r\noverlooked in attempting to arrange them according to their true\r\naffinities. This corroborates a statement in a previous chapter, viz.\r\nthat the physiological importance of a part is no index of its\r\nimportance in classification. Finally, abortive organs often are only\r\ndeveloped, proportionally with other parts, in the embryonic or young\r\nstate of each species{495}; this again, especially considering the\r\nclassificatory importance of abortive organs, is evidently part of the\r\nlaw (stated in the last chapter) that the higher affinities of organisms\r\nare often best seen in the stages towards maturity, through which the\r\nembryo passes. On the ordinary view of individual creations, I think\r\nthat scarcely any class of facts in natural history are more wonderful\r\nor less capable of receiving explanation.\r\n\r\n     {492} The case of rudimentary organs adapted to new purposes is\r\n     discussed in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 451, vi. p. 620.\r\n\r\n     {493} This is here stated on the authority of Sprengel; see also\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 452, vi. p. 621.\r\n\r\n     {494} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 455, vi. p. 627.

Brown's\r\n     name is given apparently as the authority for the fact.\r\n\r\n     {495} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 455, vi. p. 626.\r\n\r\n\r\n_The abortive organs of physiologists._\r\n\r\nPhysiologists and medical men apply the term \"abortive\" in a somewhat\r\ndifferent sense from naturalists; and their application is probably the\r\nprimary one; namely, to parts, which from accident or disease before\r\nbirth are not developed or do not grow{496}: thus, when a young animal\r\nis born with a little stump in the place of a finger or of the whole\r\nextremity, or with a little button instead of a head, or with a mere\r\nbead of bony matter instead of a tooth, or with a stump instead of a\r\ntail, these parts are said to be aborted. Naturalists on the other hand,\r\nas we have seen, apply this term to parts not stunted during the growth\r\nof the embryo, but which are as regularly produced in successive\r\ngenerations as any other most essential parts of the structure of the\r\nindividual: naturalists, therefore, use this term in a metaphorical\r\nsense. These two classes of facts, however, blend into each other{497};\r\nby parts accidentally aborted, during the embryonic life of one\r\nindividual, becoming hereditary in the succeeding generations: thus a\r\ncat or dog, born with a stump instead of a tail, tends to transmit\r\nstumps to their offspring; and so it is with stumps representing the\r\nextremities; and so again with flowers, with defective and rudimentary\r\nparts, which are annually produced in new flower-buds and even in\r\nsuccessive seedlings. The strong hereditary tendency to reproduce every\r\neither congenital or slowly acquired structure, whether useful or\r\ninjurious to the individual, has been shown in the first part; so that\r\nwe need feel no surprise at these truly abortive parts becoming\r\nhereditary. A curious instance of the force of hereditariness is\r\nsometimes seen in two little loose hanging horns, quite useless as far\r\nas the function of a horn is concerned, which are produced in hornless\r\nraces of our domestic cattle{498}. Now I believe no real distinction can\r\nbe drawn between a stump representing a tail or a horn or the\r\nextremities; or a short shrivelled stamen without any pollen; or a\r\ndimple in a petal representing a nectary, when such rudiments are\r\nregularly reproduced in a race or family, and the true abortive organs\r\nof naturalists. And if we had reason to believe (which I think we have\r\nnot) that all abortive organs had been at some period _suddenly_\r\nproduced during the embryonic life of an individual, and afterwards\r\nbecome inherited, we should at once have a simple explanation of the\r\norigin of abortive and rudimentary organs{499}. In the same manner as\r\nduring changes of pronunciation certain letters in a word may become\r\nuseless{500} in pronouncing it, but yet may aid us in searching for its\r\nderivation, so we can see that rudimentary organs, no longer useful to\r\nthe individual, may be of high importance in ascertaining its descent,\r\nthat is, its true classification in the natural system.\r\n\r\n     {496} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 454, vi. p. 625.\r\n\r\n     {497} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 454, vi. p. 625, the author in\r\n     referring to semi-monstrous variations adds \"But I doubt whether\r\n     any of these cases throw light on the origin of rudimentary organs\r\n     in a state of nature.\" In 1844 he was clearly more inclined to an\r\n     opposite opinion.\r\n\r\n     {498} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 454, vi. p. 625.\r\n\r\n     {499} See _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 454, vi. p. 625. The author there\r\n     discusses monstrosities in relation to rudimentary organs, and\r\n     comes to the conclusion that disuse is of more importance, giving\r\n     as a reason his doubt \"whether species under nature ever undergo\r\n     abrupt changes.\" It seems to me that in the _Origin_ he gives more\r\n     weight to the \"Lamarckian factor\" than he did in 1844. Huxley took\r\n     the opposite view, see the Introduction.\r\n\r\n     {500} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 455, vi. p. 627.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Abortion from gradual disuse._\r\n\r\nThere seems to be some probability that continued disuse of any part or\r\norgan, and the selection of individuals with such parts slightly less\r\ndeveloped, would in the course of ages produce in organic beings under\r\ndomesticity races with such parts abortive. We have every reason to\r\nbelieve that every part and organ in an individual becomes fully\r\ndeveloped only with exercise of its functions; that it becomes developed\r\nin a somewhat lesser degree with less exercise; and if forcibly\r\nprecluded from all action, such part will often become atrophied. Every\r\npeculiarity, let it be remembered, tends, especially where both parents\r\nhave it, to be inherited. The less power of flight in the common duck\r\ncompared with the wild, must be partly attributed to disuse{501} during\r\nsuccessive generations, and as the wing is properly adapted to flight,\r\nwe must consider our domestic duck in the first stage towards the state\r\nof the Apteryx, in which the wings are so curiously abortive. Some\r\nnaturalists have attributed (and possibly with truth) the falling ears\r\nso characteristic of most domestic dogs, some rabbits, oxen, cats,\r\ngoats, horses, &c., &c., as the effects of the lesser use of the muscles\r\nof these flexible parts during successive generations of inactive life;\r\nand muscles, which cannot perform their functions, must be considered\r\nverging towards abortion. In flowers, again, we see the gradual abortion\r\nduring successive seedlings (though this is more properly a conversion)\r\nof stamens into imperfect petals, and finally into perfect petals. When\r\nthe eye is blinded in early life the optic nerve sometimes becomes\r\natrophied; may we not believe that where this organ, as is the case with\r\nthe subterranean mole-like Tuco-tuco <_Ctenomys_>{502}, is frequently\r\nimpaired and lost, that in the course of generations the whole organ\r\nmight become abortive, as it normally is in some burrowing quadrupeds\r\nhaving nearly similar habits with the Tuco-tuco?\r\n\r\n     {501} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 11, vi. p. 13, where drooping-ears of\r\n     domestic animals are also given.\r\n\r\n     {502} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 137, vi. p. 170.\r\n\r\nIn as far then as it is admitted as probable that the effects of disuse\r\n(together with occasional true and sudden abortions during the embryonic\r\nperiod) would cause a part to be less developed, and finally to become\r\nabortive and useless; then during the infinitely numerous changes of\r\nhabits in the many descendants from a common stock, we might fairly have\r\nexpected that cases of organs becom<ing> abortive would have been numerous.\r\nThe preservation of the stump of the tail, as usually happens when an\r\nanimal is born tailless, we can only explain by the strength of the\r\nhereditary principle and by the period in embryo when affected{503}: but\r\non the theory of disuse gradually obliterating a part, we can see,\r\naccording to the principles explained in the last chapter (viz. of\r\nhereditariness at corresponding periods of life{504}, together with the\r\nuse and disuse of the part in question not being brought into play in\r\nearly or embryonic life), that organs or parts would tend not to be\r\nutterly obliterated, but to be reduced to that state in which they\r\nexisted in early embryonic life. Owen often speaks of a part in a\r\nfull-grown animal being in an \"embryonic condition.\" Moreover we can\r\nthus see why abortive organs are most developed at an early period of\r\nlife. Again, by gradual selection, we can see how an organ rendered\r\nabortive in its primary use might be converted to other purposes; a\r\nduck's wing might come to serve for a fin, as does that of the penguin;\r\nan abortive bone might come to serve, by the slow increment and change\r\nof place in the muscular fibres, as a fulcrum for a new series of\r\nmuscles; the pistil{505} of the marigold might become abortive as a\r\nreproductive part, but be continued in its function of sweeping the\r\npollen out of the anthers; for if in this latter respect the abortion\r\nhad not been checked by selection, the species must have become extinct\r\nfrom the pollen remaining enclosed in the capsules of the anthers.\r\n\r\n     {503} These words seem to have been inserted as an afterthought.\r\n\r\n     {504} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 444, vi. p. 611.\r\n\r\n     {505} This and similar cases occur in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 452,\r\n     vi. p. 621.\r\n\r\nFinally then I must repeat that these wonderful facts of organs formed\r\nwith traces of exquisite care, but now either absolutely useless or\r\nadapted to ends wholly different from their ordinary end, being present\r\nand forming part of the structure of almost every inhabitant of this\r\nworld, both in long-past and present times--being best developed and\r\noften only discoverable at a very early embryonic period, and being full\r\nof signification in arranging the long series of organic beings in a\r\nnatural system--these wonderful facts not only receive a simple\r\nexplanation on the theory of long-continued selection of many species\r\nfrom a few common parent-stocks, but necessarily follow from this\r\ntheory. If this theory be rejected, these facts remain quite\r\ninexplicable; without indeed we rank as an explanation such loose\r\nmetaphors as that of De Candolle's{506}, in which the kingdom of nature\r\nis compared to a well-covered table, and the abortive organs are\r\nconsidered as put in for the sake of symmetry!\r\n\r\n     {506} The metaphor of the dishes is given in the Essay of 1842, p.\r\n     47, note 3.{Note 173}\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X\r\n\r\nRECAPITULATION AND CONCLUSION\r\n\r\n\r\n_Recapitulation._\r\n\r\nI will now recapitulate the course of this work, more fully with respect\r\nto the former parts, and briefly <as to> the latter. In the first\r\nchapter we have seen that most, if not all, organic beings, when taken\r\nby man out of their natural condition, and bred during several\r\ngenerations, vary; that is variation is partly due to the direct effect\r\nof the new external influences, and partly to the indirect effect on the\r\nreproductive system rendering the organization of the offspring in some\r\ndegree plastic. Of the variations thus produced, man when uncivilised\r\nnaturally preserves the life, and therefore unintentionally breeds from\r\nthose individuals most useful to him in his different states: when even\r\nsemi-civilised, he intentionally separates and breeds from such\r\nindividuals. Every part of the structure seems occasionally to vary in a\r\nvery slight degree, and the extent to which all kinds of peculiarities\r\nin mind and body, when congenital and when slowly acquired either from\r\nexternal influences, from exercise, or from disuse <are inherited>, is\r\ntruly wonderful. When several breeds are once formed, then crossing is\r\nthe most fertile source of new breeds{507}. Variation must be ruled, of\r\ncourse, by the health of the new race, by the tendency to return to the\r\nancestral forms, and by unknown laws determining the proportional\r\nincrease and symmetry of the body. The amount of variation, which has\r\nbeen effected under domestication, is quite unknown in the majority of\r\ndomestic beings.\r\n\r\n     {507} Compare however Darwin's later view:--\"The possibility of\r\n     making distinct races by crossing has been greatly exaggerated,\"\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 20, vi. p. 23. The author's change of opinion\r\n     was no doubt partly due to his experience in breeding pigeons.\r\n\r\nIn the second chapter it was shown that wild organisms undoubtedly vary\r\nin some slight degree: and that the kind of variation, though much less\r\nin degree, is similar to that of domestic organisms. It is highly\r\nprobable that every organic being, if subjected during several\r\ngenerations to new and varying conditions, would vary. It is certain\r\nthat organisms, living in an _isolated_ country which is undergoing\r\ngeological changes, must in the course of time be so subjected to new\r\nconditions; moreover an organism, when by chance transported into a new\r\nstation, for instance into an island, will often be exposed to new\r\nconditions, and be surrounded by a new series of organic beings. If\r\nthere were no power at work selecting every slight variation, which\r\nopened new sources of subsistence to a being thus situated, the effects\r\nof crossing, the chance of death and the constant tendency to reversion\r\nto the old parent-form, would prevent the production of new races. If\r\nthere were any selective agency at work, it seems impossible to assign\r\nany limit{508} to the complexity and beauty of the adaptive structures,\r\nwhich _might_ thus be produced: for certainly the limit of possible\r\nvariation of organic beings, either in a wild or domestic state, is not\r\nknown.\r\n\r\n     {508} In the _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 469, vi. p. 644, Darwin makes a\r\n     strong statement to this effect.\r\n\r\nIt was then shown, from the geometrically increasing tendency of each\r\nspecies to multiply (as evidenced from what we know of mankind and of\r\nother animals when favoured by circumstances), and from the means of\r\nsubsistence of each species on an _average_ remaining constant, that\r\nduring some part of the life of each, or during every few generations,\r\nthere must be a severe struggle for existence; and that less than a\r\ngrain{509} in the balance will determine which individuals shall live\r\nand which perish. In a country, therefore, undergoing changes, and cut\r\noff from the free immigration of species better adapted to the new\r\nstation and conditions, it cannot be doubted that there is a most\r\npowerful means of selection, _tending_ to preserve even the slightest\r\nvariation, which aided the subsistence or defence of those organic\r\nbeings, during any part of their whole existence, whose organization had\r\nbeen rendered plastic. Moreover, in animals in which the sexes are\r\ndistinct, there is a sexual struggle, by which the most vigorous, and\r\nconsequently the best adapted, will oftener procreate their kind.\r\n\r\n     {509} \"A grain in the balance will determine which individual shall\r\n     live and which shall die,\" _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 467, vi. p. 642. A\r\n     similar statement occurs in the 1842 Essay, p. 8, note 3.{Note 59}\r\n\r\nA new race thus formed by natural selection would be undistinguishable\r\nfrom a species. For comparing, on the one hand, the several species of a\r\ngenus, and on the other hand several domestic races from a common stock,\r\nwe cannot discriminate them by the amount of external difference, but\r\nonly, first, by domestic races not remaining so constant or being so\r\n\"true\" as species are; and secondly by races always producing fertile\r\noffspring when crossed. And it was then shown that a race naturally\r\nselected--from the variation being slower--from the selection steadily\r\nleading towards the same ends{510}, and from every new slight change in\r\nstructure being adapted (as is implied by its selection) to the new\r\nconditions and being fully exercised, and lastly from the freedom from\r\noccasional crosses with other species, would almost necessarily be\r\n\"truer\" than a race selected by ignorant or capricious and short-lived\r\nman. With respect to the sterility of species when crossed, it was shown\r\nnot to be a universal character, and when present to vary in degree:\r\nsterility also was shown probably to depend less on external than on\r\nconstitutional differences. And it was shown that when individual\r\nanimals and plants are placed under new conditions, they become, without\r\nlosing their healths, as sterile, in the same manner and to the same\r\ndegree, as hybrids; and it is therefore conceivable that the cross-bred\r\noffspring between two species, having different constitutions, might\r\nhave its constitution affected in the same peculiar manner as when an\r\nindividual animal or plant is placed under new conditions. Man in\r\nselecting domestic races has little wish and still less power to adapt\r\nthe whole frame to new conditions; in nature, however, where each\r\nspecies survives by a struggle against other species and external\r\nnature, the result must be very different.\r\n\r\n     {510} Thus according to the author what is now known as\r\n     _orthogenesis_ is due to selection.\r\n\r\nRaces descending from the same stock were then compared with species of\r\nthe same genus, and they were found to present some striking analogies.\r\nThe offspring also of races when crossed, that is mongrels, were\r\ncompared with the cross-bred offspring of species, that is hybrids, and\r\nthey were found to resemble each other in all their characters, with the\r\none exception of sterility, and even this, when present, often becomes\r\nafter some generations variable in degree. The chapter was summed up,\r\nand it was shown that no ascertained limit to the amount of variation is\r\nknown; or could be predicted with due time and changes of condition\r\ngranted. It was then admitted that although the production of new races,\r\nundistinguishable from true species, is probable, we must look to the\r\nrelations in the past and present geographical distribution of the\r\ninfinitely numerous beings, by which we are surrounded--to their\r\naffinities and to their structure--for any direct evidence.\r\n\r\nIn the third chapter the inheritable variations in the mental phenomena\r\nof domestic and of wild organic beings were considered. It was shown\r\nthat we are not concerned in this work with the first origin of the\r\nleading mental qualities; but that tastes, passions, dispositions,\r\nconsensual movements, and habits all became, either congenitally or\r\nduring mature life, modified and were inherited. Several of these\r\nmodified habits were found to correspond in every essential character\r\nwith true instincts, and they were found to follow the same laws.\r\nInstincts and dispositions &c. are fully as important to the\r\npreservation and increase of a species as its corporeal structure; and\r\ntherefore the natural means of selection would act on and modify them\r\nequally with corporeal structures. This being granted, as well as the\r\nproposition that mental phenomena are variable, and that the\r\nmodifications are inheritable, the possibility of the several most\r\ncomplicated instincts being slowly acquired was considered, and it was\r\nshown from the very imperfect series in the instincts of the animals now\r\nexisting, that we are not justified in _prima facie_ rejecting a theory\r\nof the common descent of allied organisms from the difficulty of\r\nimagining the transitional stages in the various now most complicated\r\nand wonderful instincts. We were thus led on to consider the same\r\nquestion with respect both to highly complicated organs, and to the\r\naggregate of several such organs, that is individual organic beings; and\r\nit was shown, by the same method of taking the existing most imperfect\r\nseries, that we ought not at once to reject the theory, because we\r\ncannot trace the transitional stages in such organs, or conjecture the\r\ntransitional habits of such individual species.\r\n\r\nIn the Second Part{511} the direct evidence of allied forms having\r\ndescended from the same stock was discussed. It was shown that this\r\ntheory requires a long series of intermediate forms between the species\r\nand groups in the same classes--forms not directly intermediate between\r\nexisting species, but intermediate with a common parent. It was admitted\r\nthat if even all the preserved fossils and existing species were\r\ncollected, such a series would be far from being formed; but it was\r\nshown that we have not _good_ evidence that the oldest known deposits\r\nare contemporaneous with the first appearance of living beings; or that\r\nthe several subsequent formations are nearly consecutive; or that any\r\none formation preserves a nearly perfect fauna of even the hard marine\r\norganisms, which lived in that quarter of the world. Consequently, we\r\nhave no reason to suppose that more than a small fraction of the\r\norganisms which have lived at any one period have ever been preserved;\r\nand hence that we ought not to expect to discover the fossilised\r\nsub-varieties between any two species. On the other hand, the evidence,\r\nthough extremely imperfect, drawn from fossil remains, as far as it does\r\ngo, is in favour of such a series of organisms having existed as that\r\nrequired. This want of evidence of the past existence of almost\r\ninfinitely numerous intermediate forms, is, I conceive, much the\r\nweightiest difficulty{512} on the theory of common descent; but I must\r\nthink that this is due to ignorance necessarily resulting from the\r\nimperfection of all geological records.\r\n\r\n     {511} Part II begins with Ch. IV. See the Introduction, where the\r\n     absence of division into two parts (in the _Origin_) is discussed.\r\n\r\n     {512} In the recapitulation in the last chapter of the _Origin_,\r\n     Ed. i. p. 475, vi. p. 651, the author does not insist on this point\r\n     as the weightiest difficulty, though he does so in Ed. i. p. 299.\r\n     It is possible that he had come to think less of the difficulty in\r\n     question: this was certainly the case when he wrote the 6th\r\n     edition, see p. 438.\r\n\r\nIn the fifth chapter it was shown that new species gradually{513}\r\nappear, and that the old ones gradually disappear, from the earth; and\r\nthis strictly accords with our theory. The extinction of species seems\r\nto be preceded by their rarity; and if this be so, no one ought to feel\r\nmore surprise at a species being exterminated than at its being rare.\r\nEvery species which is not increasing in number must have its\r\ngeometrical tendency to increase checked by some agency seldom\r\naccurately perceived by us. Each slight increase in the power of this\r\nunseen checking agency would cause a corresponding decrease in the\r\naverage numbers of that species, and the species would become rarer: we\r\nfeel not the least surprise at one species of a genus being rare and\r\nanother abundant; why then should we be surprised at its extinction,\r\nwhen we have good reason to believe that this very rarity is its regular\r\nprecursor and cause.\r\n\r\n     {513} <The following words:> The fauna changes singly <were inserted\r\n     by the author, apparently to replace a doubtful erasure>.\r\n\r\nIn the sixth chapter the leading facts in the geographical distribution\r\nof organic beings were considered--namely, the dissimilarity in areas\r\nwidely and effectually separated, of the organic beings being exposed to\r\nvery similar conditions (as for instance, within the tropical forests of\r\nAfrica and America, or on the volcanic islands adjoining them). Also the\r\nstriking similarity and general relations of the inhabitants of the same\r\ngreat continents, conjoined with a lesser degree of dissimilarity in the\r\ninhabitants living on opposite sides of the barriers intersecting\r\nit--whether or not these opposite sides are exposed to similar\r\nconditions. Also the dissimilarity, though in a still lesser degree, in\r\nthe inhabitants of different islands in the same archipelago, together\r\nwith their similarity taken as a whole with the inhabitants of the\r\nnearest continent, whatever its character may be. Again, the peculiar\r\nrelations of Alpine floras; the absence of mammifers on the smaller\r\nisolated islands; and the comparative fewness of the plants and other\r\norganisms on islands with diversified stations; the connection between\r\nthe possibility of occasional transportal from one country to another,\r\nwith an affinity, though not identity, of the organic beings inhabiting\r\nthem. And lastly, the clear and striking relations between the living\r\nand the extinct in the same great divisions of the world; which\r\nrelation, if we look very far backward, seems to die away. These facts,\r\nif we bear in mind the geological changes in progress, all simply follow\r\nfrom the proposition of allied organic beings having lineally descended\r\nfrom common parent-stocks. On the theory of independent creations they\r\nmust remain, though evidently connected together, inexplicable and\r\ndisconnected.\r\n\r\nIn the seventh chapter, the relationship or grouping of extinct and\r\nrecent species; the appearance and disappearance of groups; the\r\nill-defined objects of the natural classification, not depending on the\r\nsimilarity of organs physiologically important, not being influenced by\r\nadaptive or analogical characters, though these often govern the whole\r\neconomy of the individual, but depending on any character which varies\r\nleast, and especially on the forms through which the embryo passes, and,\r\nas was afterwards shown, on the presence of rudimentary and useless\r\norgans. The alliance between the nearest species in _distinct_ groups\r\nbeing general and not especial; the close similarity in the rules and\r\nobjects in classifying domestic races and true species. All these facts\r\nwere shown to follow on the natural system being a genealogical system.\r\n\r\nIn the eighth chapter, the unity of structure throughout large groups,\r\nin species adapted to the most different lives, and the wonderful\r\nmetamorphosis (used metaphorically by naturalists) of one part or organ\r\ninto another, were shown to follow simply on new species being produced\r\nby the selection and inheritance of successive _small_ changes of\r\nstructure. The unity of type is wonderfully manifested by the similarity\r\nof structure, during the embryonic period, in the species of entire\r\nclasses. To explain this it was shown that the different races of our\r\ndomestic animals differ less, during their young state, than when full\r\ngrown; and consequently, if species are produced like races, the same\r\nfact, on a greater scale, might have been expected to hold good with\r\nthem. This remarkable law of nature was attempted to be explained\r\nthrough establishing, by sundry facts, that slight variations originally\r\nappear during all periods of life, and that when inherited they tend to\r\nappear at the corresponding period of life; according to these\r\nprinciples, in several species descended from the same parent-stock,\r\ntheir embryos would almost necessarily much more closely resemble each\r\nother than they would in their adult state. The importance of these\r\nembryonic resemblances, in making out a natural or genealogical\r\nclassification, thus becomes at once obvious. The occasional greater\r\nsimplicity of structure in the mature animal than in the embryo; the\r\ngradation in complexity of the species in the great classes; the\r\nadaptation of the larvæ of animals to independent powers of existence;\r\nthe immense difference in certain animals in their larval and mature\r\nstates, were all shown on the above principles to present no difficulty.\r\n\r\nIn the <ninth> chapter, the frequent and almost general presence of\r\norgans and parts, called by naturalists abortive or rudimentary, which,\r\nthough formed with exquisite care, are generally absolutely useless\r\n<was considered>. <These structures,> though sometimes applied to uses\r\nnot normal,--which cannot be considered as mere representative parts,\r\nfor they are sometimes capable of performing their proper\r\nfunction,--which are always best developed, and sometimes only\r\ndeveloped, during a very early period of life,--and which are of\r\nadmitted high importance in classification,--were shown to be simply\r\nexplicable on our theory of common descent.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Why do we wish to reject the theory of common descent?_\r\n\r\nThus have many general facts, or laws, been included under one\r\nexplanation; and the difficulties encountered are those which would\r\nnaturally result from our acknowledged ignorance. And why should we not\r\nadmit this theory of descent{514}? Can it be shown that organic beings\r\nin a natural state are _all absolutely invariable_? Can it be said that\r\nthe _limit of variation_ or the number of varieties capable of being\r\nformed under domestication are known? Can any distinct line be drawn\r\n_between a race and a species_? To these three questions we may\r\ncertainly answer in the negative. As long as species were thought to be\r\ndivided and defined by an impassable barrier of _sterility_, whilst we\r\nwere ignorant of geology, and imagined that the _world was of short\r\nduration_, and the number of its past inhabitants few, we were justified\r\nin assuming individual creations, or in saying with Whewell that the\r\nbeginnings of all things are hidden from man. Why then do we feel so\r\nstrong an inclination to reject this theory--especially when the actual\r\ncase of any two species, or even of any two races, is adduced--and one\r\nis asked, have these two originally descended from the same parent womb?\r\nI believe it is because we are always slow in admitting any great\r\nchange of which we do not see the intermediate steps. The mind cannot\r\ngrasp the full meaning of the term of a million or hundred million\r\nyears, and cannot consequently add up and perceive the full effects of\r\nsmall successive variations accumulated during almost infinitely many\r\ngenerations. The difficulty is the same with that which, with most\r\ngeologists, it has taken long years to remove, as when Lyell propounded\r\nthat great valleys{515} were hollowed out [and long lines of inland\r\ncliffs had been formed] by the slow action of the waves of the sea. A\r\nman may long view a grand precipice without actually believing, though\r\nhe may not deny it, that thousands of feet in thickness of solid rock\r\nonce extended over many square miles where the open sea now rolls;\r\nwithout fully believing that the same sea which he sees beating the rock\r\nat his feet has been the sole removing power.\r\n\r\n     {514} This question forms the subject of what is practically a\r\n     section of the final chapter of the _Origin_ (Ed. i. p. 480, vi. p.\r\n     657).\r\n\r\n     {515} _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 481, vi. p. 659.\r\n\r\nShall we then allow that the three distinct species of rhinoceros{516}\r\nwhich separately inhabit Java and Sumatra and the neighbouring mainland\r\nof Malacca were created, male and female, out of the inorganic materials\r\nof these countries? Without any adequate cause, as far as our reason\r\nserves, shall we say that they were merely, from living near each other,\r\ncreated very like each other, so as to form a section of the genus\r\ndissimilar from the African section, some of the species of which\r\nsection inhabit very similar and some very dissimilar stations? Shall we\r\nsay that without any apparent cause they were created on the same\r\ngeneric type with the ancient woolly rhinoceros of Siberia and of the\r\nother species which formerly inhabited the same main division of the\r\nworld: that they were created, less and less closely related, but still\r\nwith interbranching affinities, with all the other living and extinct\r\nmammalia? That without any apparent adequate cause their short necks\r\nshould contain the same number of vertebræ with the giraffe; that their\r\nthick legs should be built on the same plan with those of the antelope,\r\nof the mouse, of the hand of the monkey, of the wing of the bat, and of\r\nthe fin of the porpoise. That in each of these species the second bone\r\nof their leg should show clear traces of two bones having been soldered\r\nand united into one; that the complicated bones of their head should\r\nbecome intelligible on the supposition of their having been formed of\r\nthree expanded vertebræ; that in the jaws of each when dissected young\r\nthere should exist small teeth which never come to the surface. That in\r\npossessing these useless abortive teeth, and in other characters, these\r\nthree rhinoceroses in their embryonic state should much more closely\r\nresemble other mammalia than they do when mature. And lastly, that in a\r\nstill earlier period of life, their arteries should run and branch as in\r\na fish, to carry the blood to gills which do not exist. Now these three\r\nspecies of rhinoceros closely resemble each other; more closely than\r\nmany generally acknowledged races of our domestic animals; these three\r\nspecies if domesticated would almost certainly vary, and races adapted\r\nto different ends might be selected out of such variations. In this\r\nstate they would probably breed together, and their offspring would\r\npossibly be quite, and probably in some degree, fertile; and in either\r\ncase, by continued crossing, one of these specific forms might be\r\nabsorbed and lost in another. I repeat, shall we then say that a pair,\r\nor a gravid female, of each of these three species of rhinoceros, were\r\nseparately created with deceptive appearances of true relationship, with\r\nthe stamp of inutility on some parts, and of conversion in other parts,\r\nout of the inorganic elements of Java, Sumatra and Malacca? or have they\r\ndescended, like our domestic races, from the same parent-stock? For my\r\nown part I could no more admit the former proposition than I could admit\r\nthat the planets move in their courses, and that a stone falls to the\r\nground, not through the intervention of the secondary and appointed law\r\nof gravity, but from the direct volition of the Creator.\r\n\r\n     {516} The discussion on the three species of _Rhinoceros_ which\r\n     also occurs in the Essay of 1842, p. 48, was omitted in Ch. XIV of\r\n     the _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n\r\nBefore concluding it will be well to show, although this has\r\nincidentally appeared, how far the theory of common descent can\r\nlegitimately be extended{517}. If we once admit that two true species of\r\nthe same genus can have descended from the same parent, it will not be\r\npossible to deny that two species of two genera may also have descended\r\nfrom a common stock. For in some families the genera approach almost as\r\nclosely as species of the same genus; and in some orders, for instance\r\nin the monocotyledonous plants, the families run closely into each\r\nother. We do not hesitate to assign a common origin to dogs or cabbages,\r\nbecause they are divided into groups analogous to the groups in nature.\r\nMany naturalists indeed admit that all groups are artificial; and that\r\nthey depend entirely on the extinction of intermediate species. Some\r\nnaturalists, however, affirm that though driven from considering\r\nsterility as the characteristic of species, that an entire incapacity to\r\npropagate together is the best evidence of the existence of natural\r\ngenera. Even if we put on one side the undoubted fact that some species\r\nof the same genus will not breed together, we cannot possibly admit the\r\nabove rule, seeing that the grouse and pheasant (considered by some good\r\nornithologists as forming two families), the bull-finch and canary-bird\r\nhave bred together.\r\n\r\n     {517} This corresponds to a paragraph in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p.\r\n     483, vi. p. 662, where it is assumed that animals have descended\r\n     \"from at most only four or five progenitors, and plants from an\r\n     equal or lesser number.\" In the _Origin_, however, the author goes\r\n     on, Ed. i. p. 484, vi. p. 663: \"Analogy would lead me one step\r\n     further, namely, to the belief that all animals and plants have\r\n     descended from some one prototype.\"\r\n\r\nNo doubt the more remote two species are from each other, the weaker the\r\narguments become in favour of their common descent. In species of two\r\ndistinct families the analogy, from the variation of domestic organisms\r\nand from the manner of their intermarrying, fails; and the arguments\r\nfrom their geographical distribution quite or almost quite fails. But if\r\nwe once admit the general principles of this work, as far as a clear\r\nunity of type can be made out in groups of species, adapted to play\r\ndiversified parts in the economy of nature, whether shown in the\r\nstructure of the embryonic or mature being, and especially if shown by a\r\ncommunity of abortive parts, we are legitimately led to admit their\r\ncommunity of descent. Naturalists dispute how widely this unity of type\r\nextends: most, however, admit that the vertebrata are built on one type;\r\nthe articulata on another; the mollusca on a third; and the radiata on\r\nprobably more than one. Plants also appear to fall under three or four\r\ngreat types. On this theory, therefore, all the organisms _yet\r\ndiscovered_ are descendants of probably less than ten parent-forms.\r\n\r\n\r\n_Conclusion._\r\n\r\nMy reasons have now been assigned for believing that specific forms are\r\nnot immutable creations{518}. The terms used by naturalists of affinity,\r\nunity of type, adaptive characters, the metamorphosis and abortion of\r\norgans, cease to be metaphorical expressions and become intelligible\r\nfacts. We no longer look at an organic being as a savage does at a\r\nship{519} or other great work of art, as at a thing wholly beyond his\r\ncomprehension, but as a production that has a history which we may\r\nsearch into. How interesting do all instincts become when we speculate\r\non their origin as hereditary habits, or as slight congenital\r\nmodifications of former instincts perpetuated by the individuals so\r\ncharacterised having been preserved. When we look at every complex\r\ninstinct and mechanism as the summing up of a long history of\r\ncontrivances, each most useful to its possessor, nearly in the same way\r\nas when we look at a great mechanical invention as the summing up of the\r\nlabour, the experience, the reason, and even the blunders of numerous\r\nworkmen. How interesting does the geographical distribution of all\r\norganic beings, past and present, become as throwing light on the\r\nancient geography of the world. Geology loses glory{520} from the\r\nimperfection of its archives, but it gains in the immensity of its\r\nsubject. There is much grandeur in looking at every existing organic\r\nbeing either as the lineal successor of some form now buried under\r\nthousands of feet of solid rock, or as being the co-descendant of that\r\nburied form of some more ancient and utterly lost inhabitant of this\r\nworld. It accords with what we know of the laws impressed by the\r\nCreator{521} on matter that the production and extinction of forms\r\nshould, like the birth and death of individuals, be the result of\r\nsecondary means. It is derogatory that the Creator of countless\r\nUniverses should have made by individual acts of His will the myriads of\r\ncreeping parasites and worms, which since the earliest dawn of life have\r\nswarmed over the land and in the depths of the ocean. We cease to be\r\nastonished{522} that a group of animals should have been formed to lay\r\ntheir eggs in the bowels and flesh of other sensitive beings; that some\r\nanimals should live by and even delight in cruelty; that animals should\r\nbe led away by false instincts; that annually there should be an\r\nincalculable waste of the pollen, eggs and immature beings; for we see\r\nin all this the inevitable consequences of one great law, of the\r\nmultiplication of organic beings not created immutable. From death,\r\nfamine, and the struggle for existence, we see that the most exalted end\r\nwhich we are capable of conceiving, namely, the creation of the higher\r\nanimals{523}, has directly proceeded. Doubtless, our first impression is\r\nto disbelieve that any secondary law could produce infinitely numerous\r\norganic beings, each characterised by the most exquisite workmanship and\r\nwidely extended adaptations: it at first accords better with our\r\nfaculties to suppose that each required the fiat of a Creator.\r\nThere{524} is a [simple] grandeur in this view of life with its several\r\npowers of growth, reproduction and of sensation, having been originally\r\nbreathed into matter under a few forms, perhaps into only one{525}, and\r\nthat whilst this planet has gone cycling onwards according to the fixed\r\nlaws of gravity and whilst land and water have gone on replacing each\r\nother--that from so simple an origin, through the selection of\r\ninfinitesimal varieties, endless forms most beautiful and most wonderful\r\nhave been evolved.\r\n\r\n     {518} This sentence corresponds, not to the final section of the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 484, vi. p. 664, but rather to the opening\r\n     words of the section already referred to (_Origin_, Ed. i. p. 480,\r\n     vi. p. 657).\r\n\r\n     {519} This simile occurs in the Essay of 1842, p. 50, and in the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 485, vi. p. 665, _i.e._ in the final section of\r\n     Ch. XIV (vi. Ch. XV). In the MS. there is some erasure in pencil of\r\n     which I have taken no notice.\r\n\r\n     {520} An almost identical sentence occurs in the _Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     p. 487, vi. p. 667. The fine prophecy (in the _Origin_, Ed. i. p.\r\n     486, vi. p. 666) on \"the almost untrodden field of inquiry\" is\r\n     wanting in the present Essay.\r\n\r\n     {521} See the last paragraph on p. 488 of the _Origin_, Ed. i., vi.\r\n     p. 668.\r\n\r\n     {522} A passage corresponding to this occurs in the sketch of 1842,\r\n     p. 51, but not in the last chapter of the _Origin_.\r\n\r\n     {523} This sentence occurs in an almost identical form in the\r\n     _Origin_, Ed. i. p. 490, vi. p. 669. It will be noted that man is\r\n     not named though clearly referred to. Elsewhere (_Origin_, Ed. i.\r\n     p. 488) the author is bolder and writes \"Light will be thrown on\r\n     the origin of man and his history.\" In Ed. vi. p. 668, he writes\r\n     \"Much light &c.\"\r\n\r\n     {524} For the history of this sentence (with which the _Origin of\r\n     Species_ closes) see the Essay of 1842, p. 52, note 2{Note 184}:\r\n     also the concluding pages of the Introduction.\r\n\r\n     {525} These four words are added in pencil between the lines.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\nFor the names of Authors, Birds, Mammals (including names of classes)\r\nand Plants, see sub-indexes under _Authors_, _Birds_, _Mammals_ and\r\n_Plants_.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Acquired characters, _see_ Characters\r\n\r\n  Affinities and classification, 35\r\n\r\n  America, fossils, 177\r\n\r\n  Analogy, resemblance by, 36, 82, 199, 205, 211\r\n\r\n  Animals, marine, preservation of as fossils, 25, 139, 141;\r\n     --marine distribution, 155, 196\r\n\r\n  Australia, fossils, 177\r\n\r\n  AUTHORS, NAMES OF:--Ackerman on hybrids, 11;\r\n    Bakewell, 9, 91;\r\n    Bateson, W., xxix, 69 _n._, 217;\r\n    Bellinghausen, 124;\r\n    Boitard and Corbié, 106 _n._;\r\n    Brougham, Lord, 17, 117;\r\n    Brown, R., 233;\r\n    Buckland on fossils, 24, 137, 145 _n._;\r\n    Buffon on woodpecker, 6;\r\n    Bunbury (_Sir_ H.), rules for selection, 67;\r\n    Butler, S., 116 _n._;\r\n    d'Archiac, 146 _n._;\r\n    Darwin, C., origin of his evolutionary views, xi-xv;\r\n     --on Forbes' theory, 30;\r\n     --his _Journal of Researches_ quoted, 67 _n._, 168 _n._;\r\n     --his _Cross-and Self-Fertilisation_, 69 _n._, 103 _n._;\r\n     --on crossing Chinese and common goose, 72 _n._;\r\n    Darwin, Mrs, letter to, xxvi;\r\n    Darwin, F., on Knight's Law, 70 _n._;\r\n    Darwin, R.
