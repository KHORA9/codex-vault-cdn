Anthony and Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, that the records\r\nconnected with it should be secured to posterity. With Miss Anthony,\r\nindeed, the idea had been ever present, and from the beginning she had\r\ncarefully preserved as far as possible the letters, speeches and\r\nnewspaper clippings, accounts of conventions and legislative and\r\ncongressional reports. By 1876 they were convinced through various\r\ncircumstances that the time had come for writing the history. So\r\nlittle did they foresee the magnitude which this labor would assume\r\nthat they made a mutual agreement to accept no engagements for four\r\nmonths, expecting to finish it within that time, as they contemplated\r\nnothing more than a small volume, probably a pamphlet of a few hundred\r\npages. Miss Anthony packed in trunks and boxes the accumulations of\r\nthe years and shipped them to Mrs. Stanton's home in Tenafly, N. J.,\r\nwhere the two women went cheerfully to work.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton was the matchless writer, Miss Anthony the collector of\r\nmaterial, the searcher of statistics, the business manager, the keen\r\ncritic, the detector of omissions, chronological flaws and\r\ndiscrepancies in statement such as are unavoidable even with the most\r\ncareful historian. On many occasions they called to their aid for\r\nhistorical facts Mrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage, one of the most logical,\r\nscientific and fearless writers of her day. To Mrs. Gage Vol. I of the\r\nHistory of Woman Suffrage is wholly indebted for the first two\r\nchapters--Preceding Causes and Woman in Newspapers, and for the last\r\nchapter--Woman, Church and State, which she later amplified in a book;\r\nand Vol. II for the first chapter--Woman's Patriotism in the Civil\r\nWar.\r\n\r\nWhen the allotted time had expired the work had far exceeded its\r\noriginal limits and yet seemed hardly begun. Its authors were amazed\r\nat the amount of history which already had been made and still more\r\ndeeply impressed with the desirability of preserving the story of the\r\nearly struggle, but both were in the regular employ of lecture bureaus\r\nand henceforth could give only vacations to the task. They were\r\nentirely without the assistance of stenographers and typewriters, who\r\nat the present day relieve brain workers of so large a part of the\r\nphysical strain. A labor which was to consume four months eventually\r\nextended through ten years and was not completed until the closing\r\ndays of 1885. The pamphlet of a few hundred pages had expanded into\r\nthree great volumes of 1,000 pages each, and enough material remained\r\nunused to fill another.[1]\r\n\r\nIt was almost wholly due to Miss Anthony's clear foresight and\r\npainstaking habits that the materials were gathered and preserved\r\nduring all the years, and it was entirely owing to her unequaled\r\ndetermination and persistence that the History was written. The demand\r\nfor Mrs. Stanton on the platform and the cares of a large family made\r\nthis vast amount of writing a most heroic effort, and one which\r\ndoubtless she would have been tempted to evade had it not been for the\r\nrelentless mentor at her side, helping to bear her burdens and\r\novercome the obstacles, and continually pointing out the necessity\r\nthat the history of this movement for the emancipation of women should\r\nbe recorded, in justice to those who carried it forward and as an\r\ninspiration to the workers of the future. And so together, for a long\r\ndecade, these two great souls toiled in the solitude of home just as\r\ntogether they fought in the open field, not for personal gain or\r\nglory, but for the sake of a cause to which they had consecrated their\r\nlives. Had it not been for their patient and unselfish labor the story\r\nof the hard conditions under which the pioneers struggled to lift\r\nwoman out of her subjection, the bitterness of the prejudice, the\r\ncruelty of the persecution, never would have been told. In all the\r\nyears that have passed no one else has attempted to tell it, and\r\nshould any one desire to do so it is doubtful if, even at this early\r\ndate, enough of the records could be found for the most superficial\r\naccount. In not a library can the student who wishes to trace this\r\nmovement to its beginning obtain the necessary data except in these\r\nthree volumes, which will become still more valuable as the years go\r\nby and it nears success.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony began this work in 1876 without a dollar in hand for its\r\npublication. She never had the money in advance for any of her\r\nundertakings, but she went forward and accomplished them, and when the\r\npeople saw that they were good they usually repaid the amount she had\r\nadvanced from her own small store. In this case she resolved to use\r\nthe whole of it and all she could earn in the future rather than not\r\npublish the History. Mrs. Elizabeth Thompson, of New York, a generous\r\npatron of good works, gave her the first $1,000 in 1880, but this did\r\nnot cover the expenses that had been actually incurred thus far in its\r\npreparation. She was in nowise discouraged, however, but kept steadily\r\non during every moment which could be spared by Mrs. Stanton and\r\nherself, absolutely confident that in some way the necessary funds\r\nwould be obtained. Her strong faith was justified, for the first week\r\nof 1882 came a notice from Wendell Phillips that Mrs. Eliza Jackson\r\nEddy, of Boston, had left her a large legacy to be used according to\r\nher own judgment \"for the advancement of woman's cause.\" Litigation by\r\nan indirect heir deprived her of this money for over three years, but\r\nin April, 1885, she received $24,125.\r\n\r\nThe first volume of the History had been issued in May, 1881, and the\r\nsecond in April, 1882. In June, 1885, Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony\r\nset resolutely to work and labored without ceasing until the next\r\nNovember, when the third volume was sent to the publishers. With the\r\nbequest Miss Anthony paid the debts that had been incurred, replaced\r\nher own fund, of which every dollar had been used, and brought out\r\nthis last volume. All were published at a time when paper and other\r\nmaterials were at a high price. The fine steel engravings alone cost\r\n$5,000. On account of the engagements of the editors it was necessary\r\nto employ proofreaders and indexers, and because of the many years\r\nover which the work had stretched an immense number of changes had to\r\nbe made in composition, so that a large part of the legacy was\r\nconsumed.\r\n\r\nThe money which Miss Anthony now had enabled her to carry out her\r\nlong-cherished project to put this History free of charge in the\r\npublic libraries. It was thus placed in twelve hundred in the United\r\nStates and Europe. Mrs. Stanton and Mrs. Gage, who had contributed\r\ntheir services without price, naturally felt that it should be sold\r\ninstead of given away, and in order to have a perfectly free hand she\r\npurchased their rights. In addition to the libraries, she has given it\r\nto hundreds of schools and to countless individuals, writers,\r\nspeakers, etc., whom she thought it would enable to do better work for\r\nthe franchise. For seventeen years she has paid storage on the volumes\r\nand the stereotype plates. During this time there has been some demand\r\nfor the books from those who were able and willing to pay, but much\r\nthe largest part of the labor and money expended were a direct\r\ndonation to the cause of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nFrom the time the last volume was finished it was Miss Anthony's\r\nintention, if she should live twenty years longer, to issue a fourth\r\ncontaining the history which would be made during that period, and for\r\nthis purpose she still preserved the records. As the century drew near\r\na close, bringing with it the end of her four-score years, the desire\r\ngrew still stronger to put into permanent shape the continued story of\r\na contest which already had extended far beyond the extreme limits\r\nimagined when she dedicated to it the full power of her young\r\nwomanhood with its wealth of dauntless courage and unfailing hope. She\r\nresigned the presidency of the National Association in February, 1900,\r\nwhich marked her eightieth birthday, in order that she might carry out\r\nthis project and one or two others of especial importance. Among her\r\nbirthday gifts she received $1,000 from friends in all parts of the\r\ncountry, and this sum she resolved to apply to the contemplated\r\nvolume. One of the other objects which she had in view was the\r\ncollecting of a large fund to be invested and the income used in work\r\nfor the enfranchisement of women. Already about $3,000 had been\r\nsubscribed.\r\n\r\nBy the time the first half year had passed, nature exacted tribute for\r\nsix decades of unceasing and unparalleled toil, and it became evident\r\nthat the idea of gathering a reserve fund would have to be abandoned.\r\nThe donors of the $3,000 were consulted and all gave cordial assent to\r\nhave their portion applied to the publication of the fourth volume of\r\nthe History. The largest amount, $1,000, had been contributed by Mrs.\r\nPauline Agassiz Shaw, of Boston. Dr. Cordelia A. Greene, of Castile,\r\nN. Y., had given $500 and Mrs. Emma J. Bartol, of Philadelphia, $200.\r\nThe other contributions ranged all the way down to a few dollars,\r\nwhich in many cases represented genuine sacrifice on the part of the\r\ngivers. It is not practicable to publish the list of the women in\r\nfull. They will be sufficiently rewarded in the consciousness of\r\nhaving helped to realize Miss Anthony's dream of finishing the story,\r\nto the end of her own part in it, of a great progressive movement in\r\nwhich they were her fellow-workers and loyal friends.\r\n\r\nMrs. Gage passed away in 1898. Although Mrs. Stanton is still living\r\nas this volume goes to the publishers in 1902, and evinces her mental\r\nvigor at the age of eighty-seven in frequent magazine and newspaper\r\narticles, she could not be called upon for this heavy and exacting\r\ntask. It seemed to Miss Anthony that the one who had recently\r\ncompleted her Biography, in its preparation arranging and classifying\r\nher papers of the past sixty years, and who necessarily had made a\r\nthorough study of the suffrage movement from its beginning, should\r\nshare with her this arduous undertaking. The invitation was accepted\r\nwith much reluctance because of a full knowledge of the great labor\r\nand responsibility involved. It must be confessed that even a strong\r\nsense of obligation to further the cause of woman's enfranchisement\r\nwould not have been a sufficient incentive, but personal devotion to a\r\nbeloved and honored leader outweighed all selfish considerations. It\r\nis to Miss Anthony, however, that the world is indebted for this as\r\nwell as the other volumes. It was she who conceived the idea; through\r\nher came the money for its publication; for several years her own home\r\nhas been given up to the mass of material, the typewriters, the coming\r\nand going of countless packages, the indescribable annoyances and\r\nburdens connected with a matter of this kind. In addition she has\r\nborne from her private means a considerable portion of the expenses,\r\nand has endured the physical weariness and mental anxiety at a time\r\nwhen she has earned the right to complete rest and freedom from care.\r\nThere is not a chapter which has not had the inestimable benefit of\r\nher acute criticism and matured judgment.\r\n\r\nThe peculiar difficulties of historical work can be understood only by\r\nthose who have experienced them. General information is the easiest of\r\nall things to obtain--exact information the hardest, and a history\r\nthat is not accurate has no practical utility. If a reader discover\r\none mistake it vitiates the whole book. Every historian knows how\r\ncommon it is to find several totally different statements of the same\r\noccurrence, each apparently as authentic as the others. He also knows\r\nthe eel-like elusiveness of dates and the flat contradictions of\r\nstatistics which seem to disprove absolutely the adage that \"figures\r\ndo not lie.\" He has suffered the nightmare of wrestling with proper\r\nnames; and if he is conscientious he has agonized over the attempt to\r\ndo exact justice to the actors in the drama which he is depicting and\r\nyet not detract from its value by loading it with trivial details, of\r\nvital moment to those who were concerned in them but of no importance\r\nto future readers. All of these embarrassments are intensified in a\r\nhistory of a movement for many years unnoticed or greatly\r\nmisrepresented in the public press, and its records usually not\r\nconsidered of sufficient value to be officially preserved. None,\r\nhowever, has required such supreme courage and faithfulness from its\r\nadherents and this fact makes all the more obligatory the preserving\r\nof their names and deeds.\r\n\r\nTo collect the needful information from fifty States and Territories\r\nand arrange it for publication has required the careful and constant\r\nwork of over two years. It has been necessary many times to appeal to\r\npublic officials, who have been most obliging, but the main dependence\r\nhas been on the women of various localities who are connected with the\r\nsuffrage associations. These women have spent weeks of time and labor,\r\nwriting letters, visiting libraries, examining records, and often\r\nleaving their homes and going to the State capital to search the\r\narchives. All this has been done without financial compensation, and\r\nit is largely through their assistance that the editors have been able\r\nto prepare this volume. To give an idea of the exacting work required\r\nit may be stated that to obtain authentic data on one particular point\r\nthe writer of the Kansas chapter sent 198 letters to 178 city clerks.\r\nThe meager record of Florida necessitated about thirty letters of\r\ninquiry. Several thousand were sent out by the editors of the History,\r\nwhile the number exchanged within the various States is beyond\r\ncomputation.\r\n\r\nThe demand is widespread that the information which this book contains\r\nshould be put into accessible shape. Miss Anthony herself and the\r\nsuffrage headquarters in New York are flooded with inquiries for\r\nstatistics as to the gains which have been made, the laws for women,\r\nthe present status of the question and arguments that can be used in\r\nthe debates which are now of frequent occurrence in Legislatures,\r\nuniversities, schools and clubs in all parts of the country.\r\nPractically everything that can be desired on these points will be\r\nfound herein. The first twenty-two chapters contain the whole argument\r\nin favor of granting the franchise to women, as every phase of the\r\nquestion is touched and every objection considered by the ablest of\r\nspeakers. It has been a special object to present here in compact form\r\nthe reasons on which is based the claim for woman suffrage. In Chapter\r\nXXIV and those following are included the laws pertaining to women,\r\ntheir educational and industrial opportunities, the amount of suffrage\r\nthey possess, the offices they may fill, legislative action on matters\r\nconcerning them, and the part which the suffrage associations have had\r\nin bringing about present conditions. There are also chapters on the\r\nprogress made in foreign countries and on the organized work of women\r\nin other lines besides that of the franchise. All the care possible\r\nhas been taken to make each chapter accurate and complete.\r\n\r\nBeginning with 1884, where Vol. III closes, the present volume ends\r\nwith the century. This is not a book which must necessarily wait upon\r\nposterity for its readers, but it is filled with live, up-to-date\r\ninformation. Its editors take the greatest pleasure in presenting it\r\nto the young, active, progressive men and women of the present day,\r\nwho, without doubt, will bring to a successful end the long and\r\ndifficult contest to secure that equality of rights which belongs\r\nalike to all the citizens of this largest of republics and greatest of\r\nnations.\r\n\r\n                                             I. H. H.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[1] The reader can not fail to be interested in the personal story of\r\nthe writing of these books as related in the Reminiscences of\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton and the Life and Work of Susan B. Anthony--the\r\nmany journeys made by the big boxes of documents from the home of one\r\nto that of the other; the complications with those who were gathering\r\ndata in their respective localities; the trials with publishers; the\r\ndelays, disappointments and vexations, all interspersed and brightened\r\nwith many humorous features.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINTRODUCTION.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt has been frequently said that the first three volumes of the\r\nHistory of Woman Suffrage, which bring the record to twenty years ago,\r\nrepresent the seed-sowing time of the movement. They do far more than\r\nthis, for seeds sown in the early days which they describe would have\r\nfallen upon ground so stony that if they had sprung up they would soon\r\nhave withered away. The pioneers in the work for the redemption of\r\nwomen found an unbroken field, not fallow from lying idle, but arid\r\nand barren, filled with the unyielding rocks of prejudice and choked\r\nwith the thorns of conservatism. It required many years of labor as\r\nhard as that endured by the forefathers in wresting their lands from\r\nundisturbed nature, before the ground was even broken to receive the\r\nseed. Then followed the long period of persistent tilling and sowing\r\nwhich brought no reaping until the last quarter of the century, when\r\nthe scanty harvest began to be gathered. The yield has seemed small\r\nindeed at the end of each twelvemonth and it is only when viewed in\r\nthe aggregate that its size can be appreciated. The condition of woman\r\nto-day compared with that of last year seems unchanged, but contrasted\r\nwith that of fifty years ago it presents as great a revolution as the\r\nworld has ever witnessed in this length of time.\r\n\r\nIf the first organized demand for the rights of woman--made at the\r\nmemorable convention of Seneca Falls, N. Y., in 1848--had omitted the\r\none for the franchise, those who made it would have lived to see all\r\ngranted. It asked for woman the right to have personal freedom, to\r\nacquire an education, to earn a living, to claim her wages, to own\r\nproperty, to make contracts, to bring suit, to testify in court, to\r\nobtain a divorce for just cause, to possess her children, to claim a\r\nfair share of the accumulations during marriage. An examination of\r\nChap. XXIV and the following chapters in this volume will show that in\r\nmany of the States all these privileges are now accorded, and in not\r\none are all refused, but when this declaration was framed all were\r\ndenied by every State. For the past half century there has been a\r\nsteady advance in the direction of equal rights for women. In many\r\ninstances these have been granted in response to the direct efforts of\r\nwomen themselves; in others without exertion on their part but through\r\nthe example of neighboring States and as a result of the general trend\r\ntoward a long-delayed justice. Enough has been accomplished in all of\r\nthe above lines to make it absolutely certain that within a few years\r\nwomen everywhere in the United States will enjoy entire equality of\r\nlegal, civil and social rights.\r\n\r\nBehind all of these has been the persistent demand for political\r\nrights, and the question naturally arises, \"Why do these continue\r\nto be denied? Educated, property-owning, self-reliant and\r\npublic-spirited, why are women still refused a voice in the\r\nGovernment? Citizens in the fullest sense of the word, why are they\r\ndeprived of the suffrage in a country whose institutions rest upon\r\nindividual representation?\"\r\n\r\nThere are many reasons, but the first and by far the most important is\r\nthe fact that this right, and this alone of all that have had to be\r\ngained for woman, can be secured only through Constitutional Law. All\r\nothers have rested upon statute law, or upon the will of a board of\r\ntrustees, or of a few individuals, or have needed no official or\r\nformal sanction. The suffrage alone must be had through a change of\r\nthe constitution of the State and this can be obtained only by consent\r\nof the majority of the voters. Therefore this most valuable of all\r\nrights--the one which if possessed by women at the beginning would\r\nhave brought all the others without a struggle--is placed absolutely\r\nin the hands of men to be granted or withheld at will from women. It\r\nis an unjust condition which does not exist even in a monarchy of the\r\nOld World, and it makes of the United States instead of a true\r\nrepublic an oligarchy in which one-half of the citizens have entire\r\ncontrol of the other half. There is not another country having an\r\nelected representative body, where this body itself may not extend the\r\nsuffrage. While the writing of this volume has been in progress the\r\nParliament of Australia by a single Act has fully enfranchised the\r\n800,000 women of that commonwealth. The Parliament of Great Britain\r\nhas conferred on women every form of suffrage except that for its own\r\nmembers, and there is a favorable prospect of this being granted long\r\nbefore the women of the United States have a similar privilege.\r\n\r\nNot another nation is hampered by a written Federal Constitution which\r\nit is almost impossible to change, and by forty-five written State\r\nconstitutions none of which can be altered in the smallest particular\r\nexcept by consent of the majority of the voters. Every one of these\r\nconstitutions was framed by a convention which no woman had a voice in\r\nselecting and of which no woman was a member. With the sole exception\r\nof Wyoming, not one woman in the forty-five States was permitted a\r\nvote on the constitution, and every one except Wyoming and Utah\r\nconfined its elective franchise strictly to \"male\" citizens.\r\n\r\nThus, wherever woman turns in this boasted republic, from ocean to\r\nocean, from lakes to gulf, seeking the citizen's right of\r\nself-representation, she is met by a dead wall of constitutional\r\nprohibition. It has been held in some of the States that this applies\r\nonly to State and county suffrage and that the Legislature has power\r\nto grant the Municipal Franchise to women. Kansas is the only one,\r\nhowever, which has given such a vote. A bill for this purpose passed\r\nthe Legislature of Michigan, after years of effort on the part of\r\nwomen, and was at once declared unconstitutional by its Supreme Court.\r\nSimilar bills have been defeated in many Legislatures on the ground of\r\nunconstitutionality. It is claimed generally that they may bestow\r\nSchool Suffrage and this has been granted in over half the States, but\r\nfrequently it is vetoed by the Governor as unconstitutional, as has\r\nbeen done several times in California. In New York, after four Acts of\r\nthe Legislature attempting to give School Suffrage to all women, three\r\ndecisions of the highest courts confined it simply to those of\r\nvillages and country districts where questions are decided at \"school\r\nmeetings.\" Eminent lawyers hold that even this is \"unconstitutional.\"\r\n(See chapter on New York.) The Legislature and courts of Wisconsin\r\nhave been trying since 1885 to give complete School Suffrage to women\r\nand yet they are enabled to exercise it this year (1902) for the first\r\ntime. (See chapter on Wisconsin.) Some State constitutions provide, as\r\nin Rhode Island, that no form even of School Suffrage can be\r\nconferred on women until it has been submitted as an amendment and\r\nsanctioned by a majority of the voters.\r\n\r\nThe constitutions of a number of States declare that it shall not be\r\nsufficient to carry an amendment for it to receive a majority of the\r\nvotes cast upon it, but it must have a majority of the largest vote\r\ncast at the election. Not one State where this in the case ever has\r\nbeen able to secure an amendment for any purpose whatever. Minnesota\r\nsubmitted this question itself to the electors in 1898 in the form of\r\nan amendment and it was carried, receiving a total of 102,641, yet the\r\nlargest number of votes cast at that election was 251,250, so if its\r\nown provisions had been required it would have been lost. Nebraska is\r\nabout to make an effort to get rid of such a provision, but, as this\r\ncan be done only by another amendment to the constitution, the dilemma\r\nis presented of the improbability of securing a vote for it which\r\nshall be equal to the majority of the highest number cast at the\r\ngeneral election. Since it is impossible to get such a vote even on\r\nquestions to which there is no special objection, it is clearly\r\nevident that an amendment enfranchising women, to which there is a\r\nlarge and strong opposition, would have no chance whatever in States\r\nmaking the above requirement.\r\n\r\nIt then remains to consider the situation in those States where only a\r\nmajority of the votes cast upon the amendment itself is required. One\r\nor two instances will show the stubborn objection which exists among\r\nthe masses of men to the very idea of woman suffrage. In 1887 the\r\nLegislature of New Jersey passed a law granting School Suffrage to\r\nwomen in villages and country districts. After they had exercised it\r\nuntil 1894 the Supreme Court declared it to be unconstitutional, as\r\n\"the Legislature can not enlarge or diminish the class of voters.\" The\r\nwomen decided it was worth while to preserve even this scrap of\r\nsuffrage, so they made a vigorous effort to secure from the\r\nLegislature the submission of an amendment which should give it to\r\nthem constitutionally. The resolution for this had to pass two\r\nsuccessive Legislatures, and it happened in this case that by a\r\ntechnicality three were necessary, but with hard work and a petition\r\nsigned by 7,000 the amendment was finally submitted in 1897. The\r\nunvarying testimony of the school authorities was that the women had\r\nused their vote wisely and to the great advantage of the schools\r\nduring the seven years; there was no organized opposition from the\r\nclass who might object to the Full Suffrage for women lest their\r\nbusiness should be injured, or that other class who might fear their\r\npersonal liberty would be curtailed; yet the proposition to restore to\r\nwomen in the villages and country districts the right simply to vote\r\nfor school trustees was defeated by 75,170 noes, 65,029 ayes--over\r\n10,000 majority.\r\n\r\nSouth Dakota as a Territory permitted women to vote for all school\r\nofficers. It entered the Union in 1889 with a clause in its\r\nconstitution authorizing them to vote \"at any election held solely for\r\nschool purposes.\" They soon found that this did not include State and\r\ncounty superintendents, who are voted for at general elections, and\r\nthat in order to get back their Territorial rights an amendment would\r\nhave to be submitted to the electors. This was done by the Legislature\r\nof 1893. There had not been the slightest criticism of the way in\r\nwhich they had used their school suffrage during the past fourteen\r\nyears, no class was antagonized, and yet this amendment was voted down\r\nby 22,682 noes, 17,010 ayes, an opposing majority of 5,672.\r\n\r\nWith these examples in two widely-separated parts of the country, the\r\nold and the new, representing not only crystallized prejudice in the\r\none but inborn opposition in both to any step toward enfranchising\r\nwomen, and with this depending absolutely on the will of the voters,\r\nis it a matter of wonder that its progress has been so slow? If the\r\nquestion were submitted in any State to-day whether, for instance, all\r\nwho did not pay taxes should be disfranchised, and only taxpayers were\r\nallowed to vote upon it, it would be carried by a large majority. If\r\nit were submitted whether all owning property above a certain amount\r\nshould be disfranchised, and only those who owned less than this, or\r\nnothing, were allowed to vote, it would be carried unanimously. No\r\nclass of men could get any electoral right whatever if it depended\r\nwholly on the consent of another class whose interests supposedly lay\r\nin withholding it. Political, not moral influence removed the property\r\nrestrictions from the suffrage in order to build up a great party--the\r\nDemocratic--which because of its enfranchisement of wage-earning men\r\nhas received their support for eighty years. After the Civil War,\r\nalthough the Republican party was in absolute control, amendments to\r\nthe State constitutions for striking out the word \"white,\" in order\r\nto enfranchise colored men, were defeated in one after another of the\r\nNorthern States, even in Kansas, the most radical of them all in its\r\nanti-slavery sentiment. It finally became so evident that this\r\nconcession would not be granted by the voters that Congress was\r\nobliged to submit first one and then a second amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution to secure it. But even then the ratification of the\r\nnecessary three-fourths of the Legislatures could be obtained only\r\nbecause it was positively certain that through this action an immense\r\naddition would be made to the Republican electorate. Now after a lapse\r\nof thirty years this same party looks on unmoved at the violation of\r\nthese amendments in every Southern State because it is believed that\r\nthus there can be, through white suffrage, the building up of the\r\nparty in that section which the colored vote has not been able to\r\naccomplish.\r\n\r\nThe most superficial examination of the conditions which govern the\r\nfranchise answers the question why, after fifty years of effort, so\r\nlittle progress has been made in obtaining it for women. Of late years\r\nevery new or \"third\" party which is organized declares for woman\r\nsuffrage. This is partly because such parties come into existence to\r\ncarry out reforms in which they believe women can help, and partly\r\nbecause in their weak state they are ready to grasp at straws. While\r\ngiving them full credit for such recognition, whatever may be its\r\ninspiring motive, it is clearly evident that the franchise must come\r\nto women through the dominant parties. If either of these could have\r\nhad assurance of receiving the majority of the woman's vote it would\r\nhave been obtained for her long ago without effort on her part, just\r\nas the workingman's and the colored man's were secured for them, but\r\nthis has been impossible. Even in the four States where women now have\r\nthe full suffrage neither party has been able to claim a distinct\r\nadvantage from it. At the last Presidential election two of the four\r\nwent Democratic and two Republican. In Colorado, where women owed\r\ntheir enfranchisement very largely to the Populists, that party was\r\ndeposed from power at the first election where they voted and never\r\nhas been reinstated. Although there was no justification for holding\r\nwomen responsible, they were so held, and the party consequently did\r\nnot extend the franchise to women in other States where it might have\r\ndone so. Many consider that the principles of the Republican party in\r\ngeneral would be more apt to commend themselves to women than those of\r\nthe Democratic, but others believe that, so great is their antipathy\r\nto war and all the evils connected with it and the consequences\r\nfollowing it, they would have opposed the party responsible for these\r\nduring the past four years. It may be accepted, however, as the most\r\nprobable view that women will divide on the main issues in much the\r\nsame proportion as men. From this standpoint neither party will see\r\nany especial advantage in their enfranchisement, and both will look\r\nwith disfavor upon adding to the immense number of voters who must now\r\nbe reckoned with in every campaign an equally great number who are\r\nlikely to require an entirely different management. There is a certain\r\nelement in the leadership of all parties which is not especially\r\nobjectionable to men, but would not be tolerated by women. Candidates\r\nwho would be perfectly acceptable to men if they were sound on the\r\npolitical issues might be wholly repudiated by the women of their own\r\nparty. If temperance and morality were made requisites many leaders\r\nand officials who now hold high position would be permanently retired.\r\nThese are all reasons which appeal to politicians for deferring the\r\nday of woman suffrage as long as possible.\r\n\r\nEach of the two dominant parties is largely controlled by what are\r\nknown as the liquor interests. Their influence begins with the\r\nNational Government, which receives from them billions of revenue; it\r\nextends to the States, to which they pay millions; to the cities,\r\nwhose income they increase by hundreds of thousands; to the farmers,\r\nwho find in breweries and distilleries the best market for their\r\ngrain. There is no hamlet so small as not to be touched by their\r\nramifications. No \"trust\" ever formed can compare with them in the\r\npower which they exercise. That their business shall not be interfered\r\nwith they must possess a certain authority over Congress and\r\nLegislatures. They and the various institutions connected with them\r\ncontrol millions of votes. They are among the largest contributors to\r\npolitical campaigns. There are few legislators who do not owe their\r\nelection in a greater or less degree to the influence wielded by these\r\nliquor interests, which are positively, unanimously and unalterably\r\nopposed to woman suffrage. This can be gained only by the submission\r\nof an amendment to the National or State constitutions, and for that\r\nwomen must go to the Congress or the Legislatures. What can they offer\r\nto offset the influences behind these bodies? They have no money to\r\ncontribute for party purposes. They represent no constituency and can\r\nnot pledge a single vote, a situation in which no other class is\r\nplaced. They ask men to divide a power of which they now have a\r\nmonopoly; to give up a sure thing for an uncertainty; to sacrifice\r\nevery selfish interest--and all in the name of abstract justice, a\r\nword which has no place in politics. Was there ever apparently a more\r\nhopeless quest?\r\n\r\nWith the exception of the three amendments made necessary by the Civil\r\nWar, the Federal Constitution has not been amended for ninety-eight\r\nyears, and there is strong opposition to any changes in that\r\ninstrument. If Congress would submit an article to the State\r\nLegislatures for the enfranchisement of women the situation would be\r\nvastly simplified and eventually the requisite three-fourths for\r\nratification could be secured, but undoubtedly a number of States will\r\nhave to follow the example of those in the far West in granting the\r\nsuffrage before this is done. The question at present, therefore, may\r\nbe considered as resting with the various Legislatures. With all the\r\npowerful influences above mentioned strongly intrenched and pitted\r\nagainst the women who come empty-handed, it is naturally a most\r\ndifficult matter to secure the submission of an amendment where there\r\nis the slightest chance of its carrying. With the two exceptions of\r\nColorado and Idaho, it may be safely asserted that in every case where\r\none has been submitted it has been done simply to please the women and\r\nto get rid of them, and with the full assurance that it would not be\r\ncarried. Two conspicuous examples of the impossibility of obtaining an\r\namendment where it would be likely to receive a majority vote are to\r\nbe found in California and Iowa. In the former State one went before\r\nthe electors in 1896, and, although the conditions were most\r\nunfavorable and the strongest possible fight was made against it, so\r\nlarge an affirmative sentiment was developed that it was clearly\r\nevident it would be carried on a second trial. Up to that time the\r\nwomen of this State had very little difficulty in securing suffrage\r\nbills, but since then the Legislature has persistently refused to\r\nsubmit another amendment. (See chapter on California.)\r\n\r\nIn probably no State is the general sentiment so strongly in favor of\r\nwoman suffrage as in Iowa, and yet for the past thirty years the women\r\nhave tried in vain to secure from the Legislature the submission of an\r\namendment--simply an opportunity to carry their case to the electors.\r\n(See chapter on Iowa.) The politics of that State is practically\r\ncontrolled by the great brewing interests and the balance of power\r\nrests in the German vote. It is believed that woman suffrage would be\r\ndetrimental to their interests and they will not allow it. Here, as in\r\nmany States, a resolution for an amendment must be acted upon by two\r\nsuccessive Legislatures. If a majority of either party should pass\r\nthis resolution, the enemy would be able to defeat its nominees for\r\nthe next Legislature before the women could get the chance to vote for\r\nthem. In other words, all the forces hostile to woman suffrage are\r\nalready enfranchised and are experienced, active and influential in\r\npolitics, while the women themselves can give no assistance, and the\r\nmen in every community who favor it are very largely those who have\r\nnot an aggressive political influence. This very refusal of certain\r\nLegislatures to let the voters pass upon the question is the strongest\r\npossible indication that they fear the result. If women could be\r\nenfranchised simply by an Act of Congress they would have an\r\nopportunity to vote for their benefactors at the same time as the\r\nenemies would vote against them, and thus the former would not, as at\r\npresent, run the risk of personal defeat and the overthrow of their\r\nparty by espousing the cause of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nIf, however, Legislatures were willing to submit the question it is\r\ndoubtful whether, under present conditions, it could be carried in any\r\nlarge number of States, as the same elements which influence\r\nlegislators act also upon the voters through the party \"machines.\"\r\nAmendments to strike the word \"male\" from the suffrage clause of the\r\nConstitution have been submitted by ten States, and by five of these\r\ntwice--Kansas, 1867-94; Michigan, 1874; Colorado, 1877-93; Nebraska,\r\n1882; Oregon, 1884-1900; Rhode Island, 1886; Washington, 1889-98;\r\nSouth Dakota, 1890-98; California, 1896; Idaho, 1896. Out of the\r\nfifteen trials the amendment has been adopted but twice--in Colorado\r\nand Idaho. In these two cases it was indorsed by all the political\r\nparties and carried with their permission. Wyoming and Utah placed\r\nequal suffrage in the constitution under which they entered\r\nStatehood. In both, as Territories, women had had the full\r\nfranchise--in Wyoming twenty-one and in Utah seventeen years--and\r\npublic sentiment was strongly in favor. In the States where the\r\nquestion was defeated it had practically no party support.\r\n\r\nAside from all political hostility, however, woman suffrage has to\r\nface a tremendous opposition from other sources. The attitude of a\r\nremonstrant is the natural one of the vast majority of people. Their\r\nfirst cry on coming into the world, if translated, would be, \"I\r\nobject.\" They are opposed on principle to every innovation, and the\r\ngreatest of these is the enfranchisement of women. To grant woman an\r\nequality with man in the affairs of life is contrary to every\r\ntradition, every precedent, every inheritance, every instinct and\r\nevery teaching. The acceptance of this idea is possible only to those\r\nof especially progressive tendencies and a strong sense of justice,\r\nand it is yet too soon to expect these from the majority. If it had\r\nbeen necessary to have the consent of the majority of the men in every\r\nState for women to enter the universities, to control their own\r\nproperty, to engage in the various professions and occupations, to\r\nspeak from the public platform and to form great organizations, in not\r\none would they be enjoying these privileges to-day. It is very\r\nprobable that this would be equally true if they had depended upon the\r\npermission of a majority of women themselves. They are more\r\nconservative even than men, because of the narrowness and isolation of\r\ntheir lives, the subjection in which they always have been held, the\r\nsevere punishment inflicted by society on those who dare step outside\r\nthe prescribed sphere, and, stronger than all, perhaps, their\r\nreligious tendencies through which it has been impressed upon them\r\nthat their subordinate position was assigned by the Divine will and\r\nthat to rebel against it is to defy the Creator. In all the\r\ngenerations, Church, State and society have combined to retard the\r\ndevelopment of women, with the inevitable result that those of every\r\nclass are narrower, more bigoted and less progressive than the men of\r\nthat class.\r\n\r\nWhile the girls are crowding the colleges now until they threaten to\r\nexceed the number of boys, the demand for the higher education was\r\nmade by the merest handful of women and granted by an equally small\r\nnumber of men, who, on the boards of trustees, were able to do so,\r\nbut it would have been deferred for decades if it had depended on a\r\npopular vote of either men or women. The pioneers in the professions\r\nfound their most trying opposition from other women, instigated by the\r\nmen who did their thinking for them to believe that the whole sex was\r\nbeing disgraced. Married women almost universally were opposed to laws\r\nwhich would give them control of their property, being assured by\r\ntheir masculine advisers that this would deprive them of the love and\r\nprotection of their husbands. Public sentiment was wholly opposed to\r\nthese laws and no such objections ever have been made in Legislatures\r\neven to woman suffrage as were urged against allowing a wife to own\r\nproperty. The contest was won by the smallest fraction of women and a\r\nfew strong, far-seeing men, the latter actuated not alone by a\r\nsentiment of justice but also by the desire of preventing husbands\r\nfrom squandering the property which fathers had accumulated and wished\r\nto secure to their daughters, and fortunate indeed was it that this\r\naction did not have to be ratified by the voters.\r\n\r\nThere are in the United States between three and four million women\r\nengaged in wage-earning occupations outside of domestic service. Would\r\nthis be possible had they been obliged to have the duly recorded\r\npermission of a majority of all the men over twenty-one years old? If\r\nthe question were submitted to the votes of these men to-day whether\r\nwomen should be allowed to continue in these employments and enter any\r\nand all others, would it be carried in the affirmative in a single\r\nState?\r\n\r\nAnd yet this prejudiced, conservative and in a degree ignorant and\r\nvicious electorate possesses absolutely the power to withhold the\r\nsuffrage from women. A large part of it is composed of foreign-born\r\nmen, bringing from the Old World the most primitive ideas of the\r\ndegraded position which properly belongs to woman. Another part is\r\naddicted to habits with which it never would give women the chance to\r\ninterfere. Boys of twenty-one form another portion, fully imbued with\r\na belief in woman's inferiority which only experience can eradicate.\r\nMen of the so-called working classes vote against it because they fear\r\nto add to the power of the so-called aristocracy. The latter oppose it\r\nbecause they think the suffrage already has been too widely extended\r\nand ought to be curtailed instead of expanded. The old fogies cast a\r\nnegative ballot because they believe woman ought to be kept in her\r\n\"sphere,\" and the strictly orthodox because it is not authorized by\r\nthe Scriptures. A large body who are \"almost persuaded,\" but have some\r\nlingering doubts as to the \"expediency,\" satisfy their consciences for\r\nvoting \"no\" by saying that the women of their family and acquaintance\r\ndo not want it. Thus is the most valuable of human rights--the right\r\nof individual representation--made the football of Legislatures, the\r\nshuttlecock of voters, kicked and tossed like the veriest plaything in\r\nutter disregard of the vital fact that it is the one principle above\r\nall others on which the Government is founded.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there is abundant reason for belief that, in the face of\r\nall the forces which are arrayed against it, this measure could be\r\ncarried in almost any State where the women themselves were a unit or\r\neven very largely in the majority in favor of it. In the indifference,\r\nthe inertia, the apathy of women lies the greatest obstacle to their\r\nenfranchisement. Investigation in States where a suffrage amendment\r\nhas been voted on has shown that practically every election precinct\r\nwhere a thorough canvass was made and every voter personally\r\ninterviewed by the women who resided in it, was carried in favor. Some\r\nmen of course can not be moved, but many who never have given the\r\nsubject any thought can be set to thinking; while there is in the\r\naverage man a latent sense of justice which responds to the persuasion\r\nof a woman who comes in person and says, \"I ask you to grant me the\r\nsame rights which you yourself enjoy; I am your neighbor; I pay taxes\r\njust as you do; our interests are identical; give me the same power to\r\nprotect mine which you possess to protect yours.\" A man would have to\r\nbe thoroughly hardened to vote \"no\" after such an appeal, but if he\r\nwere let alone he could do so without any qualms. The same situation\r\nobtains in the family and in social life. The average man would not\r\nvote against granting women the franchise if all those of his own\r\nfamily and the circle of his intimate friends brought a strong\r\npressure to bear upon him in its favor. The measure could be carried\r\nagainst all opposition if every clergyman in every community would\r\nurge the women of his congregation to work for it, assuring them of\r\nthe sanction of the church and the blessing of God, and showing them\r\nhow vastly it would increase their power for good.\r\n\r\nEvery privilege which has been granted women has tended to develop\r\nthem, until their influence is incomparably stronger at the present\r\ntime than ever before. Their great organizations are a power in every\r\ntown and city. If these throughout a State would unite in a determined\r\neffort to secure the franchise, bringing to bear upon legislators the\r\ndemands of thousands of women, high and low, rich and poor, of all\r\nclasses and conditions, they would be compelled to yield; and the same\r\namount of influence would carry the amendment with the voters. But the\r\npetitioners for the suffrage are in the minority. There are many\r\nobvious reasons for this, and one of them, paradoxical as it may seem,\r\nis because so much already has been gained. Woman in general now finds\r\nher needs very well supplied. If she wants to work she has all\r\noccupations to choose from. If she desires an education the schools\r\nand colleges are freely opened to her. If she wishes to address the\r\npublic by pen or voice the people hear her gladly. The laws have been\r\nlargely modified in her favor, and where they might press they are\r\nseldom enforced. She may accumulate and control property; she may set\r\nup her own domestic establishment and go and come at will. If the\r\nworkingwoman finds herself at a disadvantage she has not time and\r\noften not ability to seek the cause until she traces it to\r\ndisfranchisement, and if she should do so she is too helpless to make\r\na contest against it. Those women who \"have dwelt, since they were\r\nborn, in well-feathered nests and have never needed do anything but\r\nopen their soft beaks for the choicest little grubs to be dropped into\r\nthem,\" can not be expected to feel or see any necessity for the\r\nballot. Nor will the woman half way between, absorbed in her church,\r\nher clubs, her charities and her household, make the philosophical\r\nstudy necessary to show that she could do larger and more effective\r\nwork for all of these if she possessed the great power which lies in\r\nthe suffrage. Even women of much wealth who are not idle,\r\nself-centered and indifferent to the needs of humanity, but are giving\r\nmunificently for religious, educational and philanthropic purposes,\r\nhave not been aroused in any large number to the necessity of the\r\nsuffrage, for reasons which are evident.\r\n\r\nReforms of every kind are inaugurated and carried forward by a\r\nminority, and there is no reason why this one should prove an\r\nexception. In not an instance has a majority of any class of men\r\ndemanded the franchise, and there is no precedent for expecting the\r\nmajority of women to do so. It will have to be gained for them by the\r\nforesight, the courage and the toil of the few, just as all other\r\nprivileges have been, and they will enter into possession with the\r\nsame eagerness and unanimity as has marked their acceptance of the\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nWith this mass of prejudice, selfishness and inertia to overcome is\r\nthere any hope of future success? Yes, there is a hope which amounts\r\nto a certainty. Nothing could be more logical than a belief that where\r\none hundred privileges have been opposed and then ninety-nine of them\r\ngranted, the remaining one will ultimately follow. While women still\r\nsuffer countless minor disadvantages, the fundamental rights have\r\nlargely been secured except the suffrage. This, as has been pointed\r\nout, is most difficult to obtain because it is intrenched in\r\nconstitutional law and because it represents a more radical revolution\r\nthan all the others combined. The softening of the bitter opposition\r\nof the early days through the general spirit of progress has been\r\nsomewhat counteracted by a modern skepticism as to the supreme merit\r\nof a democratic government and a general disgust with the prevalent\r\npolitical corruption. This will continue to react strongly against any\r\nfurther extension of the suffrage until men can be made to see that a\r\nreal democracy has not as yet existed, but that the dangerous\r\nexperiment has been made of enfranchising the vast proportion of\r\ncrime, intemperance, immorality and dishonesty, and barring absolutely\r\nfrom the suffrage the great proportion of temperance, morality,\r\nreligion and conscientiousness; that, in other words, the worst\r\nelements have been put into the ballot-box and the best elements kept\r\nout. This fatal mistake is even now beginning to dawn upon the minds\r\nof those who have cherished an ideal of the grandeur of a republic,\r\nand they dimly see that in woman lies the highest promise of its\r\nfulfilment. Those who fear the foreign vote will learn eventually that\r\nthere are more American-born women in the United States than\r\nforeign-born men and women; and those who dread the ignorant vote will\r\nstudy the statistics and see that the percentage of illiteracy is much\r\nsmaller among women than among men.\r\n\r\nThe consistent tendency since the right to individual representation\r\nwas established by the Revolutionary War has been to extend this\r\nright, until now every man in the United States is enfranchised. While\r\na few, usually those who are too exclusive to vote themselves, insist\r\nthat this is detrimental to the electorate, the vast majority hold\r\nthat in numbers there is the safety of its being more difficult to\r\npurchase or mislead; that even the ignorant may vote more honestly\r\nthan the educated; that more knowledge and judgment can be added\r\nthrough ten million electors than through five; and also that by this\r\nuniversal male suffrage it is made impossible for one class of men to\r\nlegislate against another class, and thus all excuse for anarchy or a\r\nresort to force is removed. Added to these advantages is the\r\ndeveloping influence of the ballot upon the individual himself, which\r\nrenders him more intelligent and gives him a broader conception of\r\njustice and liberty. All of these conditions must lead eventually to\r\nthe enfranchising of the only remaining part of the citizenship\r\nwithout this means of protection and development.\r\n\r\nThe gradual movement in this direction in the United States is seen in\r\nthe partial extension of the franchise which has taken place during\r\nthe past thirty-three years, or within one generation. During this\r\ntime over one-half of them have conferred School Suffrage on women;\r\none has granted Municipal Suffrage; four a vote on questions of\r\ntaxation; three have recognized them in local matters, and a number of\r\ncities have given such privileges as were possible by charter. Since\r\n1890 four States, by a majority vote of the electors, have\r\nenfranchised 200,000 women by incorporating the complete suffrage in\r\ntheir constitutions, from which it never can be removed except by a\r\nvote of women themselves. During all these years there have been but\r\ntwo retrogressive steps--the disfranchising of the women of Washington\r\nTerritory in 1888 by an unconstitutional decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt, dictated by the disreputable elements then in control; and the\r\ntaking away of the School Suffrage from all women of the second-class\r\ncities in Kentucky by its Legislature of 1902 for the purpose of\r\neliminating the vote of colored women. In every other Legislature a\r\nbill to repeal any limited franchise which has been extended has been\r\noverwhelmingly voted down.\r\n\r\nAnother favorable sign is the action taken by Legislatures on bills\r\nfor the full enfranchisement of women. Formerly they were treated with\r\ncontempt and ridicule and either thrown out summarily or discussed in\r\nlanguage which the descendants of the honorable gentlemen who used it\r\nwill regret to read. Now such bills are treated with comparative\r\ncourtesy; a discussion is avoided wherever possible, members not\r\nwishing to go on record, but if forced it is conducted in a respectful\r\nmanner; and, while usually rejected, the opposing majority is small,\r\nin many instances only just large enough to secure defeat, and\r\nfrequently members have to change their votes to the negative as they\r\nfind the measure is about to be carried. Several instances have\r\noccurred in the last year or two where the bill passed but during the\r\nnight the party whip was applied with such force that the affirmative\r\nwas compelled to reconsider its action the next day. There is little\r\ndoubt that even now if members were free to vote their convictions a\r\nbill could be carried in many Legislatures.\r\n\r\nA most encouraging sign is the attitude of the Press. Although the\r\ncountry papers occasionally refer to the suffrage advocates as hyenas,\r\ncats, crowing hens, bold wantons, unsexed females and dangerous\r\nhome-wreckers--expressions which were common a generation ago--these\r\nare no longer found in metropolitan and influential newspapers. Scores\r\nof both city and country papers openly advocate the measure and scores\r\nof others would do so if they were not under the same control as the\r\nLegislatures. Ten years ago it was almost impossible to secure space\r\nin any paper for woman suffrage arguments. To-day several of the\r\nlargest in the country maintain regular departments for this purpose,\r\nwhile the report of the press chairman of the National Association for\r\n1901 stated that during the past eight months 175,000 articles on the\r\nsubject had been sent to the press and a careful investigation showed\r\nthat three-fourths of them had been published. In addition different\r\npapers had used 150 special articles, while the page of plate matter\r\nfurnished every six weeks was extensively taken. New York reported 400\r\npapers accepting suffrage matter regularly; Pennsylvania, 368; Iowa,\r\n253; Illinois, 161; Massachusetts, 107, and other States in varying\r\nnumbers. Since this question is very largely one of educating the\r\npeople, the opening of the Press to its arguments is probably the most\r\nimportant advantage which has been gained.\r\n\r\nThe progress of public sentiment is strikingly illustrated in a\r\ncomparison of the votes in those States which have twice submitted an\r\namendment to their constitution that would give the suffrage to women.\r\nIn Kansas such an amendment in 1867 received 9,070 ayes, 19,857 noes;\r\nin 1894, 95,302 ayes, 130,139 noes. The second time it was indorsed by\r\nthe Populists and not by the Republicans, therefore the latter, who in\r\nthat State are really favorable to the measure, largely voted against\r\nit in order that the Populists might not strengthen their party by\r\nappearing to carry it, and yet the percentage of opposition was\r\nconsiderably decreased. In Colorado in 1877 the vote stood 6,612 ayes,\r\n14,055 noes; in 1893 the amendment was carried by 35,698 ayes, 29,461\r\nnoes--a majority of 6,237. Oregon in 1884 gave 11,223 ayes, 28,176\r\nnoes; in 1900, 26,265 ayes, 28,402 noes--an increase of 226 opponents\r\nand 15,042 advocates. The vote in Washington in 1889 was 16,527 ayes,\r\n35,917 noes; in 1898, 20,171 ayes, 30,497 noes--the opposing majority\r\nreduced from 19,396 to 10,326, or almost one-half.\r\n\r\nOne is logically entitled to believe from these figures that the\r\nquestion will be carried in each of those States the next time it is\r\nvoted on. It must be remembered that women go into all these campaigns\r\nwith no political influence and practically no money, not enough to\r\nemploy workers and speakers to make an approach to a thorough\r\norganization and canvass of the State; totally without the aid of\r\nparty machinery; with no platform on which to present their cause\r\nexcept such as is granted by courtesy; and with no advocacy of it by\r\nthe speakers on the platforms of the various parties. The increased\r\nmajorities indicate solely that men are emerging from the bondage of\r\ntradition, prejudice and creed, and that when they can escape from the\r\nbondage of politics they will grant justice to women.\r\n\r\nThe very fact that women themselves are arousing from their inertia to\r\nthe extent of organizing in opposition to what they term \"the danger\r\nof having the ballot thrust upon them\" shows life. While their\r\nenrollment is infinitesimal it has set women to thinking, and a number\r\nwho have signed the declaration that they do not want the franchise,\r\nhave for the first time been compelled to give the matter\r\nconsideration and have decided that they do want it. The facts also\r\nthat within a few years the membership of the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation has doubled; that auxiliaries have been formed in every\r\nState and Territory; that permanent headquarters have been established\r\nin New York; and that the revenues (almost wholly the contributions of\r\nwomen) have risen from the $2,000 or $3,000 per annum, which it was\r\nbarely possible to secure half-a-dozen years ago, to $10,345 in 1899,\r\n$22,522 in 1900 (including receipts from Bazar), $18,290 in\r\n1901--these facts are indisputable evidence of the growth of the\r\nsentiment among women. In this line of progress must be placed also\r\nthe thousands of other organizations containing millions of women,\r\nwhich, although not including the suffrage among their objects, are\r\nengaged in efforts for better laws, civic improvements and a general\r\nadvance in conditions that inevitably will bring them to realize the\r\nimmense disadvantage of belonging to a class without political\r\ninfluence.\r\n\r\nNothing could be more illogical than the belief that a republic would\r\nconfer every gift upon woman except the choicest and then forever\r\nwithhold this; or that women would be content to possess all others\r\nand not eventually demand the one most valuable. The increasing number\r\nwho are attending political conventions and crowding mass meetings\r\nuntil they threaten to leave no room for voters, are unmistakable\r\nproof that eventually women themselves and men also will see the utter\r\nabsurdity of their disfranchised condition. The ancient objections\r\nwhich were urged so forcibly a generation or two ago have lost their\r\nforce and must soon be retired from service. The charge of mental\r\nincapacity is totally refuted by the statistics of 1900 showing the\r\npercentage of girls in the High Schools to be 58.36 and of boys,\r\n41.64; the number of girl graduates, 39,162; boys, 22,575; 70 per\r\ncent. of the public school teachers women; 40,000 women college\r\ngraduates scattered throughout the country and 30,000 now in the\r\nuniversities, with the percentage of their increase in women students\r\nthree times as great as that of men, and 431,153 women practicing in\r\nthe various professions.\r\n\r\nThe charge of business incompetency is disproved by the 503,574 women\r\nwho are engaged in trade and transportation, the 980,025 in\r\nagriculture and the 1,315,890 in manufacturing and mechanical\r\npursuits. Every community also furnishes its special examples of the\r\naptitude of women for business, now that they are allowed a chance to\r\nmanifest it. Statistics show further that one-tenth of the\r\nmillionaires are women and that they are large property holders in\r\nevery locality. Whether they earned or inherited their holdings, the\r\nfact remains that they are compelled to pay taxes on billions of\r\ndollars without any representation.\r\n\r\nThe military argument--that women must not vote because they can not\r\nfight--is seldom used nowadays, as it is so clearly evident that it\r\nwould also disfranchise vast numbers of men; that the value of women\r\nin the perpetuation of the Government is at least equal to that of the\r\nmen who defend it; and that there is no recognition in the laws by\r\nwhich the franchise is exercised of the slightest connection between a\r\nballot and a bullet.\r\n\r\nThe most persistent objection--that if women are allowed to enter\r\npolitics they will neglect their homes and families--is conclusively\r\nanswered in the four States where they have had political rights for a\r\nnumber of years and domestic life still moves on just as in other\r\nplaces. In two of the four while Territories women had exercised the\r\nfranchise from seventeen to twenty-one years, and yet a large majority\r\nof the men voted to grant it perpetually. Women do not love their\r\nfamilies because compelled to do so by statute, or cling to their\r\nhomes because there is no place for them outside. This same direful\r\nprediction was made at every advanced step, but, although the entire\r\nstatus of women has been changed, and they are largely engaged in the\r\npublic work of every community, they are better and happier wives,\r\nmothers and housekeepers because they are more intelligent and live a\r\nbroader life. But they are learning, and the world is learning, that\r\ntheir housekeeping qualities should extend to the municipality and\r\ntheir power of motherhood to the children of the whole nation, and\r\nthat these should be expressed through this very politics from which\r\nthey are so rigorously excluded.\r\n\r\nThe objections of the opponents have been so largely confuted that\r\nthey have for the most part been compelled to make a last defense by\r\ndeclaring: \"When the majority of women ask for the suffrage they may\r\nhave it.\" By this very concession they admit that there is no valid\r\nreason for withholding it, and in thus arbitrarily doing so they are\r\ndenying all representation to the minority, which is wholly at\r\nvariance with republican principles. This is excused on the ground\r\nthat the franchise is not a \"right\" but a privilege to be granted or\r\nnot as seems best to those in power. This was the Tory argument before\r\nthe American Revolution, and, carried back to its origin, it upholds\r\n\"the divine authority of kings.\" The law to put in force the one and\r\nonly amendment ever added to our National Constitution to extend the\r\nfranchise was entitled, \"An act to enforce the _right_ of citizens of\r\nthe United States to vote;\" and the amendment itself reads, \"The\r\n_right_ of citizens of the United States to vote shall not be denied\r\nor abridged.\" (See Chap. I.)\r\n\r\nThe readers of the present volume will not find such a story of cruel\r\nand relentless punishment inflicted upon advocates of woman suffrage\r\nas is related in the earlier volumes of this History, but the passing\r\nof rack and thumbscrew, of stake and fagot, does not mean the end of\r\npersecution in the world. Those who stand for this reform to-day do\r\nnot tread a flower-strewn path. It is yet an unpopular subject, under\r\nthe ban of society and receiving scant measure of public sympathy, but\r\nit must continue to be urged. If the assertion had been accepted as\r\nconclusive, that a measure which after years of advocacy is still\r\nopposed by the majority should be dropped, the greatest reforms of\r\nhistory would have been abandoned. The personal character of those who\r\nrepresent a cause, however, sometimes carries more weight than the\r\nnumbers, and judged by this standard none has had stronger support\r\nthan the enfranchisement of women[2].\r\n\r\nThe struggle of the Nineteenth Century was the transference of power\r\nfrom one man or one class of men to all men, it has been said, and\r\nwhile but one country in 1800 had a constitutional government, in 1900\r\nfifty had some form of constitution and some degree of male\r\nsovereignty. Must the Twentieth Century be consumed in securing for\r\nwoman that which man spent a hundred years in obtaining for himself?\r\nThe determination of those engaged in this righteous contest was thus\r\nexpressed by the president of the National Suffrage Association in her\r\naddress at the annual convention of 1902:\r\n\r\n     Before the attainment of equal rights for men and women there\r\n     will be years of struggle and disappointment. We of a younger\r\n     generation have taken up the work where our noble and consecrated\r\n     pioneers left it. We, in turn, are enlisted for life, and\r\n     generations yet unborn will take up the work where we lay it\r\n     down. So, through centuries if need be, the education will\r\n     continue, until a regenerated race of men and women who are equal\r\n     before man and God shall control the destinies of the earth.\r\n\r\nBut have we not reason to hope, in this era of rapid fulfilment--when\r\nin all material things electricity is accomplishing in a day what\r\nrequired months under the old régime--that moral progress will keep\r\npace? And that as much stronger as the electric power has shown itself\r\nthan the coarse and heavy forces of the stone and iron periods, so\r\nmuch superior will prove the _noblesse oblige_ of the men and women of\r\nthe present, achieving in a generation what was not possible to the\r\nnarrow selfishness and ignorant prejudice of all the past ages?\r\n\r\nA part of the magnificent plan to beautify Washington, the capital of\r\nthe nation, is a colossal statue to American Womanhood. The design\r\nembodies a great arch of marble standing on a base in the form of an\r\noval and broken by sweeps of steps. On either side are large bronze\r\npanels, bearing groups of figures. One of these will be a symbolic\r\ndesign showing the spirit of the people descending to lay offerings on\r\nwoman's altar. Lofty pillars crowned by figures representing Victory,\r\nare to be placed at the approaches. Surmounting the arch will be the\r\nchief group of the composition, symbolizing Woman Glorified. She is\r\nrising from her throne to greet War and Peace, Literature and Art,\r\nScience and Industry, who approach to lay homage at her feet. Inside\r\nthe arch is a memorial hall for recording the achievements of women.\r\n\r\nHow soon this symbol shall become reality and woman stand forth in all\r\nthe glory of freedom to reach her highest stature, depends upon the\r\nuse she makes of the opportunities already hers and the fraternal\r\nassistance she receives from man. Fearless of criticism, courageous in\r\nfaith, let each take for a guide these inspiring words which it has\r\nbeen said the Puritan of old would utter if he could speak: \"I was a\r\nradical in my day; be thou the same in thine! I turned my back upon\r\nthe old tyrannies and heresies and struck for the new liberties and\r\nbeliefs; my liberty and my belief are doubtless already tyranny and\r\nheresy to thine age; strike thou for the new!\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[2] For partial list, see Appendix--Eminent Advocates of Woman\r\nSuffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nILLUSTRATIONS\r\n\r\n\r\n  ANTHONY, SUSAN B.                                   _Frontispiece_\r\n  ANTHONY, MARY S.                                               848\r\n  AVERY, RACHEL FOSTER                                           270\r\n  AVERY, SUSAN LOOK                                              678\r\n  BLACKWELL, ALICE STONE                                         270\r\n  BLANKENBURG, LUCRETIA L.                                       750\r\n  CATT, CARRIE CHAPMAN                                           388\r\n  CHAPMAN, MARIANA W.                                            848\r\n  CLAY, LAURA                                                    270\r\n  COGGESHALL, MARY J.                                            948\r\n  EATON, DR.

While the word \"male\" was not used in this document, yet\r\nwith the one exception of New Jersey, where women exercised the full\r\nsuffrage from the adoption of its first constitution in 1776 until\r\n1807, there is no record of any woman's being permitted to vote. At\r\nthe inception of the republic women were almost wholly uneducated;\r\nthey were unknown in the industrial world; there were very few\r\nproperty owners among them; the manifold exactions of domestic duties\r\nabsorbed all their time, strength and interest; and for these and many\r\nother causes they were not public factors in even the smallest sense\r\nof the word. One could readily believe that the founders of the\r\nGovernment never imagined a time when women would ask for a voice were\r\nit not for the significant fact that every State constitution, except\r\nthe one mentioned above, was careful to put up an absolute barrier\r\nagainst such a contingency by confining the elective franchise\r\nstrictly to \"male\" citizens--and there it has stood impassable down to\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\nIt was almost the exact middle of the nineteenth century before the\r\nfirst demand was made by women for the right to represent\r\nthemselves--the right for which their forefathers had fought a\r\nseven-years' war, and the one which had been made the corner-stone of\r\nthe new Government. The complete story of the startling results which\r\nfollowed this demand never has been told but once, and that was when\r\nVol. I of this History of Woman Suffrage was written. It was related\r\nthen by the two who were the principal personages in a period which\r\ntried women's souls as they were never tried before--Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton and Susan B. Anthony.[3]\r\n\r\nThis movement for the freedom of women was scarcely launched when the\r\nlong-threatened Civil War broke forth and precipitated the struggle\r\nfor the liberty of another class whose slavery seemed far more\r\nterrible than the servitude of white women. The five years' ordeal\r\nwhich followed developed women as all the previous centuries had not\r\nbeen able to do, and when peace reigned once more, when an entire race\r\nhad been born into freedom and the republic had been consecrated anew,\r\nthe whole status of the American woman had been changed and the lines\r\nwhich circumscribed her old sphere had been forever obliterated. Women\r\nwere studying laws, constitutions and public questions as never before\r\nin all history, and, as they saw millions of colored men endowed with\r\nthe full prerogatives of citizenship, they began to ask, \"Am I not\r\nalso a citizen of this great republic and entitled to all its rights\r\nand privileges?\"\r\n\r\nUp to this time the word \"male\" never had appeared in the Federal\r\nConstitution. In 1865, when the leaders among women were beginning to\r\ngather up their scattered forces, and the Fourteenth Amendment was\r\nunder discussion, they saw to their amazement and indignation that it\r\nwas proposed to incorporate in that instrument this discriminating\r\nword. Miss Anthony was the first to sound the alarm, and Mrs. Stanton\r\nquickly came to her aid in the attempt to prevent this desecration of\r\nthe people's Bill of Rights. The thrilling account of their efforts to\r\nthwart this highhanded act, their abandonment in consequence by nearly\r\nall of their co-workers before and during the war, their anger and\r\nhumiliation at seeing the former slaves, whom they had helped to free,\r\nmade their political superiors and endowed with a personal\r\nrepresentation in Government which women had been pilloried for\r\nasking--all this is graphically told in Vol. II of the History of\r\nWoman Suffrage, Chaps. XVII and XXI. The story with many personal\r\ntouches is also related in the Life and Work of Susan B. Anthony,\r\nChaps. XV and XVI.\r\n\r\nThe Fourteenth Amendment was declared adopted July 28, 1868,[4] and\r\nthe women felt that the ground had been swept from beneath their feet,\r\nas now the barriers opposed to their enfranchisement by all the State\r\nconstitutions had been doubly and trebly strengthened by sanction of\r\nthe National Constitution. The first ray of encouragement came in\r\nOctober, 1869, when, at a State woman suffrage convention held in St.\r\nLouis, Mo., Francis Minor, a leading attorney of that city, declared\r\nthat this very Fourteenth Amendment in enfranchising colored men had\r\nperformed a like service for all women. His argument was embodied\r\nconcisely in the following resolutions, which were adopted by that\r\nconvention with great enthusiasm, and by the National Association at\r\nits annual convention in Washington, D. C., the next January:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, All persons born or naturalized in the United States,\r\n     and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the\r\n     United States and of the State wherein they reside; therefore be\r\n     it\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, 1. That the immunities and privileges of American\r\n     citizenship, however defined, are national in character and\r\n     paramount to all State authority.\r\n\r\n     2. That while the Constitution of the United States leaves the\r\n     qualification of electors to the several States, it nowhere gives\r\n     them the right to _deprive_ any citizen of the elective franchise\r\n     which is possessed by any other citizen--to _regulate_ not\r\n     including the right to _prohibit_.\r\n\r\n     3. That, as the Constitution of the United States expressly\r\n     declares that no State shall make or enforce any laws that shall\r\n     abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United\r\n     States, those provisions of the several State constitutions which\r\n     exclude women from the franchise on account of sex are violative\r\n     alike of the spirit and letter of the Federal Constitution.\r\n\r\n     4. That, as the subject of _naturalization_ is expressly withheld\r\n     from the States, and as the States clearly have no right to\r\n     deprive of the franchise naturalized citizens, among whom women\r\n     are expressly included, still more clearly have they no right to\r\n     deprive native-born women citizens of the franchise.\r\n\r\nIn support of these resolutions various portions of the National\r\nConstitution were quoted, including Article IV, Section 2: \"The\r\ncitizens of each State shall be entitled to all privileges and\r\nimmunities of citizens in the several States;\" and Section 4: \"The\r\nUnited States shall guarantee to every State in this Union a\r\nrepublican form of government.\" Many other authorities were cited,\r\nincluding numerous court decisions, as to the right of women to the\r\nsuffrage now that their citizenship had been clearly established and\r\nthe protection of its privileges and immunities guaranteed.\r\n\r\nThis position was sustained by many of the best lawyers in the United\r\nStates, including members of Congress. The previous May the National\r\nWoman Suffrage Association had been formed in New York City, and\r\nhenceforth this right to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment was made\r\nthe keynote of all its speeches, resolutions, etc., as will be seen in\r\nthe History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. II, Chap. XXIII.\r\n\r\nFor the first time the Federal Constitution had defined the term\r\n\"citizen,\" leaving no doubt that a woman was a citizen in the fullest\r\nmeaning of the word. Until now there had been but one Supreme Court\r\ndecision on this point--that of Chief Justice Taney in 1857, in the\r\nDred Scott Case, which declared that citizens were \"the political body\r\nwho, according to our republican institutions, form the sovereignty\r\nand hold the power, and conduct the Government through their\r\nrepresentatives.\" This plainly had barred negroes and white women from\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nAt the next general election, in 1872, women attempted to vote in many\r\nparts of the country, in some cases their votes being received, in\r\nothers rejected.[5] The vote of Miss Anthony was accepted in\r\nRochester, N. Y., and she was then arrested for a criminal offense,\r\ntried and fined in the U. S. Circuit Court at Canandaigua, by\r\nAssociate Justice Ward Hunt of the U. S. Supreme Court. There is no\r\nmore flagrant judicial outrage on record. The full account of this\r\ncase, in which she was refused the right of trial by jury as\r\nguaranteed by the Constitution, will be found in Vol. II, History of\r\nWoman Suffrage, p. 627 and following; also much more in detail in the\r\nLife and Work of Susan B. Anthony, p. 423, with her great\r\nConstitutional Argument delivered in fifty of the postoffice districts\r\nof the two counties before the trial, p. 977 and following.\r\n\r\nThe vote of Mrs. Virginia L. Minor was refused in St. Louis and she\r\nbrought suit against the inspectors of election. The case was decided\r\nagainst her in the Circuit Court of the county and the Supreme Court\r\nof Missouri. She then carried it to the Supreme Court of the United\r\nStates--_Minor vs. Happersett et al._ No. 182, October term, 1874. The\r\ncase was argued by her husband, Francis Minor, and after the lapse of\r\na quarter of a century it is still believed that his argument could\r\nnot have been excelled. The decision was delivered by Chief Justice\r\nWaite, March 29, 1875, and was in brief: \"The National Constitution\r\ndoes not define the privileges and immunities of citizens. The United\r\nStates has no voters of its own creation. The Constitution does not\r\nconfer the right of suffrage upon any one, but the franchise must be\r\nregulated by the States. The Fourteenth Amendment does not add to the\r\nprivileges and immunities of a citizen; it simply furnishes an\r\nadditional guarantee to protect those he already has. Before the\r\npassage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments the States had the\r\npower to disfranchise on account of race or color. These Amendments,\r\nratified by the States, simply forbade that discrimination but did not\r\nforbid that against sex.\"\r\n\r\nThe full text of argument and decision will be found in the History of\r\nWoman Suffrage, Vol. II, p. 715 and following. In making this decision\r\nthe Court was compelled to reverse absolutely its own finding of three\r\nyears previous in what was known as the _Slaughter House Cases_ (16\r\nWallace) which said: \"The negro having by the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nbeen declared to be a citizen of the United States, _is thus made a\r\nvoter_ in every State in the Union.\"\r\n\r\nThe Fifteenth Amendment says: \"The right of citizens of the United\r\nStates to vote shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or\r\nby any State on account of race, color or previous condition of\r\nservitude.\" No right is conferred by this amendment. It simply\r\nguarantees protection for a right already existing in the citizen, and\r\nthe negro having been declared a citizen by the Fourteenth Amendment\r\nis thus protected in his right to vote. But whence did he obtain this\r\nright unless from the National Constitution, which the Supreme Court\r\nin the Minor decision declares \"does not confer the right of suffrage\r\nupon any one\"? Volume II of this History of Woman Suffrage, containing\r\nnearly 1,000 pages, is devoted mainly to a recital of the efforts on\r\nthe part of women to obtain and exercise the franchise through the\r\nFourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments. This decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt destroyed the last hope, although it did not shake the belief of\r\nthe leaders of this movement in the justice and legality of their\r\nclaim.\r\n\r\nA number of the women contended that, if the National Constitution did\r\nnot confer Full Suffrage, it did at least guarantee Federal\r\nSuffrage--the right to vote for Congressional Representatives--and in\r\nthis opinion they were sustained by eminent lawyers. The National\r\nAssociation, however, never made an issue of this question,\r\nconsidering that it would be useless, but it has a Standing Committee\r\non Federal Suffrage empowered to make such efforts in this direction\r\nas it deems advisable.[6]\r\n\r\nThe assertion is made that if Congress had no authority over the\r\nelection of its own members, it would be wholly unable to perpetuate\r\nitself should the States at any time decide that they no longer care\r\nto be under the authority of a central governing body, and refuse to\r\nelect Representatives. Many able reports have been made by this\r\nStanding Committee, and the question was clearly stated in an article\r\nin _The Arena_, December, 1891, by Francis Minor, who gave the\r\nquestion of woman suffrage a more thorough legal examination,\r\nperhaps, than any other man. He prepared the following bill which was\r\npresented in the House of Representatives, April 25, 1892, by the Hon.\r\nClarence D. Clark, member from Wyoming:\r\n\r\n     AN ACT TO PROTECT THE RIGHT OF CITIZENS OF THE UNITED STATES TO\r\n     REGISTER AND TO VOTE FOR MEMBERS OF THE HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The right to choose Members of the House of\r\n     Representatives is vested by the Constitution in the people of\r\n     the several States, without distinction of sex, but for want of\r\n     proper legislation has hitherto been restricted to one-half of\r\n     the people; for the purpose, therefore, of correcting this error\r\n     and of giving effect to the Constitution:\r\n\r\n     _Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n     United States of America in Congress assembled:_ That at all\r\n     elections hereafter held in the several States of this Union for\r\n     members of the House of Representatives, the right of citizens of\r\n     the United States, of either sex, above the age of twenty-one\r\n     years, to register and to vote for such Representatives shall not\r\n     be denied or abridged by the United States, or by any State, on\r\n     account of sex.\r\n\r\nThe argument for the authority of Congress to pass this law is based\r\npartly on Article I of the Federal Constitution:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 2. The House of Representatives shall be composed of\r\n     members chosen every second year by the people of the several\r\n     States; and the electors in each State shall have the\r\n     qualifications requisite for electors of the most numerous branch\r\n     of the State Legislature.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 4. The time, place and manner of holding elections for\r\n     Senators and Representatives shall be prescribed in each State by\r\n     the Legislature thereof, but the Congress may at any time by law\r\n     make or alter such regulations, except as to the places of\r\n     choosing Senators.[7]\r\n\r\nCongress is here endowed unquestionably with the right to regulate the\r\nelection of Representatives. James Madison, one of the framers of the\r\nConstitution, when asked the intention of this clause, in the Virginia\r\nconvention of 1788, called to ratify this instrument, answered that\r\nthe power was reserved to Congress because \"should the people of any\r\nState by any means be deprived of the right of suffrage, it was judged\r\nproper that it should be remedied by the General Government.\"\r\n[Elliott's Debates, Vol. II, p. 266.]\r\n\r\nAgain Madison said in _The Federalist_ (No. 54), in speaking of the\r\nenumeration for Representatives:\r\n\r\n     The Federal Constitution, therefore, decides with great propriety\r\n     in the case of our slaves when it views them in the mixed\r\n     character of persons and property. This is in fact their true\r\n     character. It is the character bestowed on them by the laws under\r\n     which they live; and it will not be denied that these are the\r\n     proper criteria; because it is only under the pretext that the\r\n     laws have transformed the negroes into subjects of property, that\r\n     _a place is disputed them in the computation of numbers_; and it\r\n     is admitted that, if the laws were to restore the rights which\r\n     have been taken away, _the negroes could no longer be refused an\r\n     equal share of representation_.\r\n\r\nTherefore, as women _are_ counted in the enumeration on which the\r\nCongressional apportionment is based, they are legally entitled to an\r\nequal share in direct representation.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 the case of Jasper Yarbrough and others who had been sentenced\r\nto hard labor in the penitentiary in Georgia for preventing a colored\r\nman from voting for a member of Congress, was brought to the U. S.\r\nSupreme Court by a petition for a writ of _habeas corpus_. The\r\ndecision rendered March 2, virtually nullified that given by this\r\ncourt in the case of Mrs. Minor in 1875, as quoted above, which held\r\nthat \"the National Constitution has no voters,\" for this one declared:\r\n\r\n     But it is not correct to say that the right to vote for a member\r\n     of Congress does not depend on the Constitution of the United\r\n     States. The office, if it be properly called an office, is\r\n     created by the Constitution and by that alone. It also declares\r\n     how it shall be filled, namely, by election. Its language is:\r\n     \"The House of Representatives shall be composed of members chosen\r\n     every second year by the people of the several States; and the\r\n     electors in each State shall have the qualifications requisite\r\n     for electors of the most numerous branch of the State\r\n     Legislature.\"\r\n\r\n     The States in prescribing the qualifications of voters for the\r\n     most numerous branch of their own Legislature, do not do this\r\n     with reference to the election for members of Congress. Nor can\r\n     they prescribe the qualifications for those _eo nomine_ [by that\r\n     name].\r\n\r\n     They define who are to vote for the popular branch of their own\r\n     Legislature, and the Constitution of the United States says the\r\n     same persons shall vote for members of Congress in that State.\r\n\r\n     It adopts the qualification thus furnished as the qualification\r\n     of its own electors for members of Congress. _It is not true,\r\n     therefore, that the electors for members of Congress owe their\r\n     right to vote to the State law in any sense which makes the\r\n     exercise of the right to depend exclusively on the law of the\r\n     State._\r\n\r\n     Counsel for petitioners seizing upon the expression found in the\r\n     opinion of the Court in the case of _Minor vs. Happersett_, \"that\r\n     the Constitution of the United States does not confer the right\r\n     of suffrage upon any one,\" without reference to the connection in\r\n     which it is used, insists that the voters in this case do not owe\r\n     their right to vote in any sense to that instrument. But the\r\n     Court was combating the argument that this right was conferred on\r\n     all citizens, and therefore upon women as well as men.(!)\r\n\r\n     In opposition to that idea it was said the Constitution adopts,\r\n     as the qualification for voters for members of Congress, that\r\n     which prevails in the State where the voting is to be done;\r\n     therefore, said the opinion, the right is not definitely\r\n     conferred on any person or class of persons by the Constitution\r\n     alone, because you have to look to the law of the State for the\r\n     description of the class. But the Court did not intend to say\r\n     that, when the class or the person is thus ascertained, his right\r\n     to vote for a member of Congress was not _fundamentally based\r\n     upon the Constitution which created the office of member of\r\n     Congress_, and declared it should be elective, and pointed to the\r\n     means of ascertaining who should be electors.\r\n\r\n     The Fifteenth Amendment of the Constitution, by its limitation of\r\n     the power of the States in the exercise of their right to\r\n     prescribe the qualifications of voters in their own elections,\r\n     and by its limitation of the power of the United States over that\r\n     subject, clearly shows that the right of suffrage was considered\r\n     to be of supreme importance to the National Government and _was\r\n     not intended to be left within the exclusive control of the\r\n     States_.\r\n\r\n     In such cases this Fifteenth Article of amendment does _proprio\r\n     vigore_ [by its own force] substantially _confer on the negro the\r\n     right to vote_, and Congress has the power to protect and enforce\r\n     that right. In the case of _United States vs. Happersett_, so\r\n     much relied on by counsel, this Court said, in regard to the\r\n     Fifteenth Amendment, that it has invested the citizens of the\r\n     United States with a new constitutional right which is within the\r\n     protecting power of Congress. That right is an exemption from\r\n     discrimination in the exercise of the elective franchise on\r\n     account of race, color or previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\n     This new constitutional right was mainly designed for [male]\r\n     citizens of African descent. The principle, however, that the\r\n     protection of the exercise of this right _is within the power of\r\n     Congress_, is as necessary to the right of other citizens to vote\r\n     in general as to the right to be protected against\r\n     discrimination.\r\n\r\nThis legal hair-splitting is beyond the comprehension of the average\r\nlay mind and will be viewed by future generations with as much\r\ncontempt as is felt by the present in regard to the infamous decision\r\nof the Supreme Court in the Dred Scott case in 1857. If it decides\r\nanything it is that the right to vote for Congressional\r\nRepresentatives is a Federal right, vested in all the people by the\r\nNational Constitution, and one which it is beyond the power of the\r\nStates to regulate. Therefore, no State has the power to deprive women\r\nof the right to vote for Representatives in Congress.\r\n\r\nThose who hold that women are already entitled to Federal Suffrage\r\nunder the National Constitution, further support their claim by a\r\nseries of decisions as to the citizenship of women and the inherent\r\nrights which it carries. They quote especially the case of the _United\r\nStates vs. Kellar_. The defendant was indicted by a Federal grand jury\r\nin Illinois for illegal voting in a Congressional election, as he\r\nnever had been naturalized. He and his mother were born in Prussia,\r\nbut came to the United States when he was a minor, and she married a\r\nnaturalized citizen. The case was tried in June, 1882, in the Circuit\r\nCourt of the United States for the Southern District of Illinois, by\r\nAssociate Justice Harlan of the U. S. Supreme Court, who discharged\r\nthe defendant. He held that the mother, having become a citizen by\r\nmarriage while the son was a minor, transferred citizenship to him. In\r\nother words she transmitted a Federal Citizenship including the right\r\nto vote which she did not herself possess, thus enfranchising a child\r\nborn while she was an alien. The whole matter was settled not by State\r\nbut by Federal authority.[8] If a mother can confer this right on a\r\nson, why not on a daughter? But why does she not possess it herself?\r\nThe clause of the National Constitution which established suffrage at\r\nthe time that instrument was framed, does not mention the sex of the\r\nelector.\r\n\r\nThe argument for Federal Suffrage was presented in a masterly manner\r\nbefore the National Convention of 1889 by U. S. Senator Henry W. Blair\r\n(N. H.); and it was discussed by Miss Anthony and Mrs. Minor. See\r\npresent volume, Chap. IX.\r\n\r\nFrom this bare outline of the claim that women already possess Federal\r\nSuffrage, or that Congress has authority to confer it without the\r\nsanction of the States, readers can continue the investigation.\r\nNotwithstanding its apparent equity, the leaders of the National\r\nAssociation, including Miss Anthony herself, felt convinced after the\r\ndecision against Mrs. Minor that it would be useless to expect from\r\nthe Supreme Court any interpretation of the Constitution which would\r\npermit women to exercise the right of suffrage. They had learned,\r\nhowever, through the passage of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\r\nAmendments, that it had been possible to amend this document in such a\r\nway as to enfranchise an entire new class of voters--or in other words\r\nto protect them in the exercise of a right which it seemed that in\r\nsome mysterious way they already possessed. As the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment declared the negroes to be citizens, and the Fifteenth\r\nforbade the United States or any State to deny or abridge \"the right\r\nof citizens of the United States to vote, on account of race, color or\r\nprevious condition of servitude,\" it was clearly evident that this\r\nright inhered in citizenship. This being the case women must already\r\nhave it, but as there was no national authority prohibiting the States\r\nfrom denying or abridging it, each of them did so by putting the word\r\n\"male\" in its constitution as a qualification for suffrage; just as\r\nmany of them had used the word \"white\" until the adoption of the\r\nFifteenth Amendment by a three-fourths majority made this\r\nunconstitutional. Therefore, since the _Minor vs. Happersett_\r\ndecision, the National Association has directed its principal efforts\r\nto secure from Congress the submission to the several State\r\nLegislatures of a Sixteenth Amendment which should prohibit\r\ndisfranchisement on account of \"sex,\" as the Fifteenth had done on\r\naccount of \"color.\"\r\n\r\nThe association does not discourage attempts in various States to\r\nsecure from their respective Legislatures the submission of an\r\namendment to the voters which shall strike out this word \"male\" from\r\ntheir own constitutions. On the contrary, it assists every such\r\nattempt with money, speakers and influence, but having seen such\r\namendments voted on sixteen times and adopted only twice (in Colorado\r\nand Idaho), it is confirmed in the opinion that the quickest and\r\nsurest way to secure woman suffrage will be by an amendment to the\r\nFederal Constitution. In other words it holds that women should be\r\npermitted to carry their case to the selected men of the Legislatures\r\nrather than to the masses of the voters.\r\n\r\nFrom 1869 until the decision in the Minor case in 1875, the National\r\nAssociation went before committees of every Congress with appeals for\r\na Declaratory Act which would permit women to vote under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment. Since that decision it has asked for a Sixteenth\r\nAmendment. In both cases it has been supported by petitions of\r\nhundreds of thousands of names.\r\n\r\nThe ablest women this nation has produced have presented the arguments\r\nand pleadings. Many of the older advocates have passed away, but new\r\nones have taken their place. It is the unvarying testimony of the\r\nSenate and House Committees who have granted these hearings, that no\r\nbody of men has appeared before them for any purpose whose dignity,\r\nlogic and acumen have exceeded, if indeed they have equaled, those of\r\nthe members of this association. They have been heard always with\r\nrespect, often with cordiality, but their appeals have fallen, if not\r\nupon deaf, at least upon indifferent ears. They have asked these\r\ncommittees to report to their respective Houses a resolution to submit\r\nthis Sixteenth Amendment. Sometimes the majority of the committee has\r\nbeen hostile to woman suffrage and presented an adverse report:\r\nsometimes it has been friendly and presented one favorable; sometimes\r\nthere have been an opposing majority and a friendly minority report,\r\nor vice versa; but more often no action whatever has been taken.\r\nDuring these thirty years eleven favorable reports have been\r\nmade--five from Senate, six from House Committees.[9]\r\n\r\nIn the History of Woman Suffrage, Vols. II and III, will be found a\r\nfull record of various debates which occurred in Senate and House on\r\ndifferent phases of the movement to secure suffrage for women previous\r\nto 1884, when the present volume begins. In 1885 Thomas W. Palmer gave\r\nhis great speech in the United States Senate in advocacy of their\r\nenfranchisement; and in 1887 occurred the first and only discussion\r\nand vote in that body on a Sixteenth Amendment for this purpose, both\r\nof which are described herein under their respective dates.\r\n\r\nIn the following chapters will be found an account of the annual\r\nconventions of the National Suffrage Association since 1883, and of\r\nthe American until the two societies united in 1890, with many of the\r\nresolutions and speeches for which these meetings have been\r\ndistinguished. They contain also portions of the addresses, covering\r\nevery phase of this subject, made at the hearings before Congressional\r\nCommittees, and the arguments advanced for and against woman suffrage\r\nin the favorable and adverse reports of these committees, thus\r\npresenting both sides of the question. Readers who follow the story\r\nwill be obliged to acknowledge that the very considerable progress\r\nwhich has been made toward obtaining the franchise is due to the\r\nunceasing and long-continued efforts of this association far more than\r\nto all other agencies combined; and that the women who compose this\r\nbody have demonstrated their capacity and their right to a voice in\r\nthe Government infinitely beyond any class to whom it has been granted\r\nsince the republic was founded.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[3] The part of this record with which Miss Anthony herself was\r\ndirectly connected, and which comprises by far the greater portion of\r\nthe whole, is given with many personal incidents in her Life and Work.\r\n[Husted-Harper.]\r\n\r\n[4] ARTICLE XIV.\r\n\r\n_Section 1._ All persons born or naturalized in the United States and\r\nsubject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States\r\nand of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce\r\nany law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens;\r\nnor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty or property,\r\nwithout due process of law, or deny to any person within its\r\njurisdiction the equal protection of the laws.\r\n\r\n_Section 2._ Representatives shall be apportioned among the several\r\nStates according to their respective numbers, counting the whole\r\nnumber of persons in each State, excluding Indians not taxed. But when\r\nthe right to vote at any election for the choice of electors for\r\nPresident and Vice-President of the United States, Representatives in\r\nCongress, the Executive and Judicial officers of a State, or the\r\nmembers of the Legislature thereof, is denied to any of the _male_\r\ninhabitants of such State, being twenty-one years of age, and citizens\r\nof the United States, or in any way abridged, except for participation\r\nin rebellion or other crime, the basis of representation therein shall\r\nbe reduced in the proportion which the number of such _male_ citizens\r\nshall bear to the whole number of _male_ citizens twenty-one years of\r\nage in such State.\r\n\r\n[5] Women also had attempted to vote in local and State elections in\r\n1870 and 1871. An account of the trials and decisions which followed\r\nwill be found in the History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. II, Chap. XXV.\r\n\r\n[6] The most earnest advocates of the constitutional right of women to\r\nFederal Suffrage are Mrs. Sallie Clay Bennett, Ky.; Mrs. Clara B.\r\nColby, D. C.; Mrs. Martha E. Root, Mich.; Miss Sara Winthrop Smith,\r\nConn. They have done a large amount of persistent but ineffectual work\r\nin the endeavor to obtain a recognition of this right.\r\n\r\n[7] Senator John Sherman did at one time introduce a bill for this\r\npurpose.\r\n\r\n[8] This is precisely what was done in the case of Susan B. Anthony\r\nabove referred to.\r\n\r\n[9] The first report, in 1871, was signed by Representatives Benjamin\r\nF. Butler (Mass.) and William A. Loughridge (Ia.): History of Woman\r\nSuffrage, Vol. II, p. 464.\r\n\r\nThe second, in 1879, was signed by Senators George F. Hoar (Mass.),\r\nJohn H. Mitchell (Ore.), Angus Cameron (Wis.): Id., Vol. III, p. 131.\r\n\r\nThe third, in 1882, was signed by Senators Elbridge G. Lapham (N. Y.),\r\nThomas W. Ferry (Mich.), Henry W. Blair (N. H.), Henry B. Anthony (R.\r\nI.): Id., p. 231.\r\n\r\nThe fourth, in 1883, was signed by Representative John D. White (Ky.):\r\nId., p. 263.\r\n\r\nFor the fifth and sixth, in 1884, see Chap.

XII.\r\n\r\nIt is worthy of notice that from 1879 to 1891, inclusive, Miss Susan\r\nB. Anthony was enabled to spend the congressional season in Washington\r\n[see pp. 188, 366], and during this time nine of these eleven\r\nfavorable reports were made.\r\n\r\nFor adverse reports see History of Woman Suffrage: 1871, Vol. II, p.\r\n461; 1878, Vol. III, p. 112; 1882, Id., p. 237; 1884, present volume,\r\nChap.

XVI.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL SUFFRAGE CONVENTION OF 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first Woman's Rights Convention on record was held in Seneca\r\nFalls, N. Y., in July, 1848; the second in Salem, O., in April, 1850;\r\nthe third in Worcester, Mass., in October, 1850. By this time the\r\nmovement for the civil, educational and political rights of women was\r\nfully initiated, and every year thenceforth to the beginning of the\r\nCivil War national conventions were held in various States for the\r\npurpose of agitating the question and creating a favorable public\r\nsentiment. These were addressed by the ablest men and women of the\r\ntime, and the discussions included the whole scope of women's wrongs,\r\nwhich in those days were many and grievous.\r\n\r\nImmediately after the war the political disabilities of the negro man\r\nwere so closely akin to those of all women that the advocates of\r\nuniversal suffrage organized under the name of the Equal Rights\r\nAssociation. The \"reconstruction period,\" however, engendered so many\r\ndifferences of opinion, and a platform so broad permitted such\r\nlatitude of debate, the women soon became convinced that their own\r\ncause was being sacrificed. Therefore in May, 1869, under the\r\nleadership of Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Miss Susan B. Anthony,\r\nthe National Woman Suffrage Association was formed in New York City,\r\nhaving for its sole object the enfranchisement of women. From this\r\ntime it held a convention in Washington, D. C., every winter.\r\n\r\nThe above mentioned associations and conventions, as well as the\r\nAmerican Woman Suffrage Association, formed at Cleveland, O., in\r\nNovember, 1869, under the leadership of Mrs. Lucy Stone, are described\r\nin detail in the preceding volumes of this History. The present volume\r\nbegins with the usual convention of the National Association in\r\nWashington in 1884. This place was selected for a twofold purpose:\r\nbecause here a more cosmopolitan audience could be secured than in any\r\nother city, including representatives from every State in the Union\r\nand from all the nations of the world; and because here the\r\nassociation could carry directly to the only tribunal which had power\r\nto act, its demand for a submission to the State Legislatures of an\r\namendment to the Federal Constitution which should forbid\r\ndisfranchisement on account of sex. During each of these conventions\r\nit was the custom for committees of the Senate and House to grant\r\nhearings to the leading advocates of this proposition.\r\n\r\nThe Sixteenth of these annual conventions met in Lincoln Hall, in\r\nresponse to the usual Call,[10] March 4, 1884, continuing in session\r\nfour days.[11]\r\n\r\nOn the evening before the convention a handsome reception was given at\r\nthe Riggs House by Charles W. and Mrs. Jane H. Spofford to Miss Susan\r\nB. Anthony, which was attended by several hundred prominent men and\r\nwomen. Delegates were present from twenty-six States and\r\nTerritories.[12] Miss Anthony was in the chair at the opening session\r\nand read a letter from Mrs. Stanton, who was detained at home, in\r\nwhich she paid a glowing tribute to Wendell Phillips, the staunch\r\ndefender of the rights of women, who had died the preceding month.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary B. Clay, in speaking of the work in her State, said:\r\n\r\n     In talking to a Kentuckian on the subject of woman's right to\r\n     qualify under the law, you have to batter down his self-conceit\r\n     that he is just and generous and chivalric toward woman, and\r\n     that she can not possibly need other protection than he gives her\r\n     with his own right arm--while he forgets that it is from man\r\n     alone woman needs protection, and often does she need the right\r\n     to protect herself from the avarice, brutality or neglect of the\r\n     one nearest to her. The only remedy for her, as for man himself,\r\n     in this republic, is the ballot in her hand. He thinks he is\r\n     generous to woman when he supplies her wants, forgetting that he\r\n     has first robbed her by law of all her property in marriage, and\r\n     then may or may not give her that which is her own by right of\r\n     inheritance....\r\n\r\n     A mother, legally so, has no right to her child, the husband\r\n     having the right to will it to whom he pleases, and even to will\r\n     away from the mother the unborn child at his death. The wife does\r\n     not own her own property, personal or real, unless given for her\r\n     sole use and benefit. If a husband may rent the wife's land, or\r\n     use it during his life and hers, and take the increase or rental\r\n     of it, and after her death still hold it and deprive her children\r\n     of its use, which he does by curtesy, and if she can not make a\r\n     will and bequeath it at her death, then I say she is robbed, and\r\n     insulted in the bargain, by such so-called ownership of land. \"A\r\n     woman fleeing from her husband and seeking refuge or protection\r\n     in a neighbor's house, the man protecting her makes himself\r\n     liable to the husband, who can recover damages by law.\" \"If a\r\n     husband refuse to sue for a wife who has been slandered or\r\n     beaten, she can not sue for herself.\" These are Kentucky laws.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harriette R. Shattuck closed her record for Massachusetts by\r\nsaying: \"The dead wall of indifference is at last broken down and the\r\nwomen 'remonstrants,' by their active resistance to our advancing\r\nprogress, are not only turning the attention of the public in our\r\ndirection and making the whole community interested, but also are\r\npaving the way for future political action themselves. By\r\nremonstrating they have expressed their opinion and entered into\r\npolitics.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Abigail Scott Duniway gave a full report of the situation in\r\nOregon, and a hopeful outlook for the success of the pending suffrage\r\namendment.[13] This was followed later by a strong address. A letter\r\nwas read from Mrs. Sallie Clay Bennett (Ky.). Dr. Clemence S. Lozier\r\n(N. Y.) spoke briefly, saying that for eleven years her parlor had\r\nbeen opened each month for suffrage meetings, and that \"this question\r\nis the foundation of Christianity; for Christians can look up and\r\ntruly say 'Our Father' only when they can treat each other as brothers\r\nand sisters.\" Mrs. Mary Seymour Howell (N. Y.) gave an eloquent\r\naddress on The Outlook, answering the four stock questions: Why do not\r\nmore women ask for the ballot? Will not voting destroy the womanly\r\ninstincts? Will not women be contaminated by going to the polls? Will\r\nthey not take away employment from men?\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the evening session Miss Anthony read a letter from\r\nMrs. Millicent Garrett Fawcett of England, and an extract from a\r\nrecent speech by her husband, Henry Fawcett, member of Parliament and\r\nPostmaster General, strongly advocating the removal of all political\r\ndisabilities of women. Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton Harbert (Ills.) spoke on\r\nThe Statesmanship of Women, citing illustrious examples in all parts\r\nof the world. Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake (N. Y.) gave a trenchant and\r\nhumorous speech on The Unknown Quantity in Politics, showing the\r\nindirect influence of women which unfortunately is not accompanied\r\nwith responsibility. She took up leading candidates and their records,\r\ncriticising or commending; illustrated how in every department women\r\nare neglected and forgotten, and closed as follows:\r\n\r\n     It is better to have the power of self-protection than to depend\r\n     on any man, whether he be the Governor in his chair of State, or\r\n     the hunted outlaw wandering through the night, hungry and cold\r\n     and with murder in his heart. We are tired of the pretense that\r\n     we have special privileges and the reality that we have none; of\r\n     the fiction that we are queens, and the fact that we are\r\n     subjects; of the symbolism which exalts our sex but is only a\r\n     meaningless mockery. We demand that these shadows shall take\r\n     substance. The coat of arms of the State of New York represents\r\n     Liberty and Justice supporting a shield on which is seen the sun\r\n     rising over the hills that guard the Hudson. How are justice and\r\n     liberty depicted? As a police judge and an independent voter? Oh,\r\n     no; as two noble and lovely women! What an absurdity in a State\r\n     where there is neither liberty nor justice for any woman! We ask\r\n     that this symbolism shall assume reality, for a redeemed and\r\n     enfranchised womanhood will be the best safeguard of justice.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blake was followed by Mrs. Martha McClellan Brown, of Cincinnati\r\nWesleyan College, who spoke on Disabilities of Woman. Miss Anthony\r\nread the report from Missouri by Mrs. Virginia L. Minor, who strongly\r\nsupported her belief in the constitutional right of women to the\r\nfranchise. A letter of greeting was read from Miss Fannie M. Bagby,\r\nmanaging editor St. Louis _Chronicle_; Miss Phoebe W. Couzins (Mo.)\r\ngave a brilliant address entitled What Answer?\r\n\r\nAt the evening session the hall was crowded. The speech of Mrs. Belva\r\nA. Lockwood (D. C.), the first woman admitted to practice before the\r\nSupreme Court, was a severe criticism on the disfranchising of the\r\nwomen in Utah as proposed by bills now before Congress. It was a clear\r\nand strong legal argument which would be marred by an attempt at\r\nquotation.\r\n\r\nIn an address on Women Before the Law, the report says:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Helen M. Gougar of Indiana traced the development of human\r\n     liberty as shown in the history of the ballot, which was at first\r\n     given to a certain class of believers in orthodox religions, then\r\n     to property holders, then to all white men. She showed how class\r\n     legislation had been gradually done away with by allowing\r\n     believer and unbeliever, rich and poor, white and black, to vote\r\n     unquestioned and unhindered, and as a result of this onward march\r\n     of justice, the last remaining form of class legislation, now\r\n     shown by the sex ballot, must pass away. She declared the\r\n     sex-line to be the lowest standard upon which to base a privilege\r\n     and unworthy the civilization of the present time. She answered\r\n     many of the popular objections to woman suffrage by showing that\r\n     if education were to be made the test of the ballot, women would\r\n     not be the disfranchised class in America, as three-fifths of all\r\n     graduates from the public schools in the last ten years have been\r\n     women. If morality were to be made a test, women would do more\r\n     voting than men. The ratio of law-abiding women to men is as one\r\n     to every 103; of drunken women to drunken men, one to every\r\n     1,000. Reasoning from these facts, if sobriety, virtue and\r\n     intelligence were necessary qualifications, women enfranchised\r\n     would largely reflect these elements in the Government.\r\n\r\nAt noon on March 6 the delegates were courteously received at the\r\nWhite House by President Chester A. Arthur.\r\n\r\nDuring the afternoon session the Pennsylvania report was presented by\r\nEdward M. Davis, son-in-law of Lucretia Mott, and an exhaustive\r\naccount of Woman's Work in Philadelphia by Mrs. Lucretia L.\r\nBlankenburg. A letter from Mrs. Anna C. Wait (Kas.) was read by Mrs.\r\nBertha H. Ellsworth, who closed with a tribute to Mrs. Wait and a poem\r\ndedicated to Kansas.\r\n\r\nThe guest of the convention, Mrs. Jessie M. Wellstood of Edinburgh,\r\npresented a report made by Miss Eliza Wigham, secretary of the\r\nScotland Suffrage Association, prefaced with some earnest remarks in\r\nwhich she said:\r\n\r\n     To those who are sitting at ease, folding their hands and sweetly\r\n     saying: \"I have all the rights I want, why should I trouble about\r\n     these matters?\" let me quote the burning words of the grand old\r\n     prophet Isaiah, which entered into my soul and stirred it to\r\n     action: \"Rise up, ye women that are at ease; hear my voice, ye\r\n     careless daughters, give ear unto my speech; many days shall ye\r\n     be troubled, ye careless women, etc.\" It is just because we fold\r\n     our hands and sit at ease that so many of our less fortunate\r\n     fellow creatures are leading lives of misery, want, sin and\r\n     shame.\r\n\r\nIn the evening Mrs. May Wright Sewall (Ind.) delivered a beautiful\r\naddress on Forgotten Women, which she closed with these words: \"It was\r\nnot a grander thing to lead the forlorn hope in 1776, not a grander\r\nthing to strike the shackles from the black slaves in 1863, than it\r\nwould be in 1884 to carry a presidential campaign on the basis of\r\nPolitical Equality to Women. The career, the fame, to match that of\r\nWashington, to match that of Lincoln, awaits the man who will espouse\r\nthe cause of forgotten womanhood and introduce that womanhood to\r\npolitical influence and political freedom.\"\r\n\r\nInteresting addresses were made by Mrs. Mary E. Haggart (Ind.), Why Do\r\nNot Women Vote? and by the Rev. Phebe A. Hanaford, pastor of the\r\nSecond Universalist Church, Jersey City, on New Jersey as a\r\nLeader--the first to grant suffrage to women. They voted from 1776\r\nuntil the Legislature took away the right in 1807.\r\n\r\nAt the afternoon session of the last day Mrs. Lizzie D. Fyler, a\r\nlawyer of Arkansas, gave an extended résumé of the legal and\r\neducational position of women in that State, which was shown to be in\r\nadvance of many of the eastern and western States. George W. Clark,\r\none of the old Abolition singers contemporaneous with the Hutchinsons,\r\nexpressed a strong belief in woman suffrage and offered a tribute of\r\nsong to Wendell Phillips. Brief addresses were made by Mrs. J. Ellen\r\nFoster (Ia.) and Mrs. Morrison (Mass.). A letter of greeting was read\r\nfrom the corresponding secretary, Rachel G. Foster, Julia and Mrs.\r\nJulia Foster (Penn.), written in Florence, Italy. Mrs. Caroline Gilkey\r\nRogers described School Suffrage in Lansingburgh, N. Y.\r\n\r\nAn eloquent address was made by Mrs. Caroline Hallowell Miller (Md.),\r\nin which she said:\r\n\r\n     There are a great many excellent people in the world who are\r\n     strongly prejudiced against what they designate \"isms,\" but who\r\n     are always glad of any opportunity of serving God, as they\r\n     express it. I ask what can finite beings do to serve Omnipotence\r\n     unless it be to exert all their powers for the good of humanity,\r\n     for the uplifting of man, which, if aught of ours could do, must\r\n     rejoice our Creator. When we see more than one-half of the adult\r\n     human family--reasonably industrious and intelligent, if we make\r\n     for them no larger claim, and certainly the _raison d'etre_ of\r\n     the other half--called to account by the laws of the land and\r\n     held in strict obedience to them without the slightest voice in\r\n     their making, with neither form nor shadow of representation\r\n     before State or country, do we not see that there rests upon the\r\n     entire race a stigma that materialist and idealist, agnostic and\r\n     churchman, should each and all hasten to remove?\r\n\r\n     \"Behold, the fields are white unto harvest, but the laborers are\r\n     few!\" How can it be longer tolerated that the wives and mothers,\r\n     the sisters and daughters, of a land claiming the highest degree\r\n     of civilization and boasting of freedom as its watchword, should\r\n     still rank before the law with criminals, idiots and slaves? I\r\n     feel as confident as I do of my existence, that the apathy which\r\n     we are now fighting against, especially among our own sex,\r\n     springs mainly from want of thought; the women of culture\r\n     throughout the country placidly accept the comfortable conditions\r\n     in which they find themselves. They receive without question the\r\n     formulated theories of woman's sphere as they accept the\r\n     formulated theories of the orthodox religions into which they may\r\n     chance to have been born; occasionally an original thinker steps\r\n     out of the ranks and finds herself after a while with a few\r\n     followers. They remain but few, however, for it is too much\r\n     trouble to think.\r\n\r\nAt the evening session the Rev. Florence Kollock (Ills.) spoke on The\r\nEthics of Woman Suffrage, saying in part:\r\n\r\n     By what moral right stands a law upon the statute books that\r\n     infringes upon the rights and duties of womanhood, that prohibits\r\n     a mother from the full discharge of the duties of her sacred\r\n     office, as all are prohibited through the law that forbids them\r\n     the opportunity of throwing their whole moral strength, influence\r\n     and convictions against the existence and growth of social and\r\n     political iniquities and in defense of truth and purity? The\r\n     great evils of our day are of such a nature that all, regardless\r\n     of moral principles or sex, suffer from their effects, proving\r\n     clearly that all have a moral obligation in these matters, and\r\n     the fact that one human being suffers from an evil carries with\r\n     it the highest authority to remove that evil.\r\n\r\n     The silent influence of woman has failed to accomplish the\r\n     desired good of humanity, has failed to bring about the needed\r\n     moral reforms, and all observing persons are ready to concede\r\n     that posing is a weak way of combating giant evils--that\r\n     attitudism can not take the place of activity. To suppress the\r\n     full utterance of the moral convictions of those who so largely\r\n     mold the character of the race is a crime against humanity,\r\n     against progress, against God.\r\n\r\nMrs. Shattuck, in discussing the question, said:\r\n\r\n     It is absolutely necessary for the improvement of the race that\r\n     the manly and womanly elements shall be side by side in all walks\r\n     of life, and the fact that our social status, our literature and\r\n     our educational systems have been greatly improved by woman's\r\n     co-operation with man, points to the eternal truth that man and\r\n     woman must work hand in hand in the State also, in order that it\r\n     shall be uplifted and saved. Woman herself will not be harmed by\r\n     the ballot, for the acquisition of greater responsibilities\r\n     improves and not degrades the recipient thereof. If the ballot\r\n     has made man worse it will make woman worse, and not otherwise.\r\n     Whoever studies the history of the race from age to age and\r\n     nation to nation finds the world has advanced and not retrograded\r\n     by giving responsibility to the individual. The opposition to\r\n     woman suffrage strikes a blow at the foundation-stone of this\r\n     republic, which is self-representation by means of the ballot. At\r\n     the bottom of this opposition is a subtle distrust of American\r\n     institutions, an idea of \"restricted suffrage\" which is creeping\r\n     into our republic through so-called aristocratic channels.\r\n\r\nA distinguishing feature of this convention was the large number of\r\nletters and reports sent from abroad, undoubtedly due to the fact that\r\nMrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony had spent the preceding year in Europe,\r\nmaking the acquaintance and arousing the interest of foreign men and\r\nwomen in the status of the suffrage question in the United States.\r\nAmong these letters was one from Miss Frances Power Cobbe in which she\r\nsaid: \"The final and complete emancipation of our sex ere long, I\r\nthink, is absolutely certain. All is going well here and I hope with\r\nyou in America; and with all my heart, dear Miss Anthony, I wish you\r\nand the woman's convention triumphant success.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Jane Cobden, daughter of Richard Cobden, said in the course of\r\nher letter: \"I feel all the more certain of the righteousness of the\r\nwork in which I am so much engaged, because I know from words spoken\r\nand written by my father as far back as 1845, that had he been living\r\nat the present day I should have had his sympathy. He was nothing if\r\nnot consistent, and so he said in a speech delivered in London that\r\nyear on Free Trade: 'There are many ladies present, I am happy to say.\r\nNow it is a very anomalous and singular fact that they can not vote\r\nthemselves and yet they have the power of conferring votes upon other\r\npeople. I wish they had the franchise, for they would often make a\r\nmuch better use of it than their husbands.'\"\r\n\r\nMiss Caroline Ashurst Biggs, for many years editor of the\r\n_Englishwoman's Review_, sent a full report of the situation in\r\nEngland. There was a letter of greeting also from Miss Lydia Becker,\r\neditor of the _Women's Suffrage Journal_ and member of the Manchester\r\nSchool Board. John P. Thomasson and Peter A. Taylor, members of\r\nParliament, favored woman suffrage in the strongest terms, the latter\r\nsaying: \"Justice never can be done to the rising generations till the\r\ninfluence of the mother is freed from the ignominy of exclusion from\r\nthe great political and social work of the day.\" Mrs. Thomasson,\r\ndaughter of Margaret Bright Lucas, and Mrs. Taylor, known as the\r\norganizer of the women's suffrage movement in England, also sent\r\ncordial good wishes.[14]\r\n\r\nThe wife of Jacob Bright, who was largely responsible for the Married\r\nWomen's Property Bill, presented a review of present suffrage laws;\r\nhis sister, Mrs. Priscilla Bright McLaren, wife of Duncan McLaren, M.\r\nP., and the great Abolitionist, Mrs. Elizabeth Pease Nichol of\r\nEdinburgh, sent long and valuable letters. Mrs. McLaren wrote:\r\n\r\n     I was in Exeter Hall, London, on the day our Parliament\r\n     assembled; a prayer-meeting was held there the whole of that day.\r\n     Earnest were the intercessions that the hearts of our rulers\r\n     might be influenced to repeal every vestige of the Contagious\r\n     Diseases Acts; and the women especially prayed that our men might\r\n     be led to send representatives to Parliament of much higher\r\n     morality than such Acts testified to, and that the eyes of the\r\n     women of their country might be opened to see the iniquity of\r\n     such legislation. I venture to express that the burden of my\r\n     prayer had been, whilst sitting in that meeting, that the eyes of\r\n     the women there assembled, and of the women throughout our\r\n     country, might be opened to see that we could not expect men who\r\n     did not consider morality to be a necessary part of their own\r\n     character, to regard it as needful for the men who were to\r\n     represent them in Parliament; that we needed a new moral power\r\n     to be brought into exercise at our elections, and as Parliament\r\n     was meeting that day and one of its first acts would be to bring\r\n     in a new reform bill, that we might unite in prayer that the\r\n     petitions so long put forth by many of the women of this land,\r\n     that their claim to the suffrage should be included in this new\r\n     Act for the extended representation of the people, might be\r\n     righteously answered; and the power given to women not only to\r\n     pray for what was just and right, but to have by the\r\n     Parliamentary vote a direct power to promote that higher\r\n     legislation which they all so much desired. I know nothing which\r\n     calls for more faith and patience than to hear women pleading for\r\n     justice, and refusing to help get it in the only legitimate\r\n     way....\r\n\r\n     Whilst we have our anomalies here, you have a glaring\r\n     inconsistency in your country. It is not a property qualification\r\n     which gives a vote in America. Is not every human being, who is\r\n     of age, according to your Constitution, entitled to equal justice\r\n     and freedom? Are you women not human beings? The lowest and most\r\n     ignorant man who leaves any shore and lands on yours, ere he has\r\n     earned a home or made family ties, becomes a citizen of your\r\n     great country; whilst your own women, who during a life-time may\r\n     have done much service and given much to the State, are denied\r\n     the right accorded to that man, however low his condition may be.\r\n     You are fighting to overcome this great monopoly of citizenship.\r\n     We watch your proceedings with deep interest. We rejoice in your\r\n     successes and sympathize with you in your endeavors to gain fresh\r\n     victories.\r\n\r\nCongratulatory letters were received from Ewing Whittle, M. D., of the\r\nRoyal Academy, Liverpool, and Miss Isabella M. S. Tod, the well-known\r\nreformer of Belfast. M. Leon Richer, the eminent writer of Paris, and\r\nMlle. Hubertine Auclert, editor of _La Citoyenne_, sent cordial words\r\nof co-operation. There were also greetings from Mrs. Ernestine L.\r\nRose, a Polish exile, one of the first women lecturers in America;\r\nfrom the wife and daughter of A. A. Sargent, U. S. Minister to Berlin;\r\nfrom Theodore Stanton; Miss Florence Kelley, daughter of the Hon.\r\nWilliam D. Kelley; the wife of Moncure D. Conway; Rosamond, daughter\r\nof Robert Dale Owen; Mrs. Charlotte B. Wilbour and Dr. Frances E.\r\nDickinson, all Americans residing abroad.\r\n\r\nAmong the noted men and women of the United States who sent letters\r\nendorsing equal suffrage, were George William Curtis, William Lloyd\r\nGarrison, U. S. Senators Henry B. Anthony and Henry W. Blair, the Hon.\r\nGeorge W. Julian, the Hon. William I. Bowditch, Robert Purvis, the\r\nRev. Anna Oliver, Mrs. Zerelda G. Wallace, the \"mother\" of Ben Hur,\r\nand Mrs. Abby Hutchinson Patton.[15]\r\n\r\nTo this assembly Bishop Matthew Simpson, of the Methodist Episcopal\r\nChurch, sent almost his last public utterance:\r\n\r\n     For more than thirty years I have been in favor of woman\r\n     suffrage. I was led to this position not by the consideration of\r\n     the question of natural rights or of alleged injustice or of\r\n     inequality before the law, but by what I believed would be the\r\n     influence of woman on the great moral questions of the day. Were\r\n     the ballot in the hands of women, I am satisfied that the evils\r\n     of intemperance would be greatly lessened, and I fear that\r\n     without that ballot we shall not succeed against the saloons and\r\n     kindred evils in large cities. You will doubtless have many\r\n     obstacles placed in your way; there will be many conflicts to\r\n     sustain; but I have no doubt that the coming years will see the\r\n     triumph of your cause; and that our higher civilization and\r\n     morality will rejoice in the work which enlightened woman will\r\n     accomplish.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions presented by Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton Harbert (Ills.),\r\nchairman of the committee, were adopted.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The fundamental idea of a republic is the right of\r\n     self-government, the right of every citizen to choose her own\r\n     representatives to enact the laws by which she is governed; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, This right can be secured only by the exercise of the\r\n     suffrage; therefore\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the ballot in the hand of every qualified\r\n     citizen constitutes the true political status of the people, and\r\n     to deprive one-half of the people of the use of the ballot is to\r\n     deny the first principle of a republican government.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the duty of Congress to submit a\r\n     Sixteenth Amendment to the National Constitution, securing to\r\n     women the right of suffrage; first, because the disfranchisement\r\n     of one-half of the people deprives that half of the means of\r\n     self-protection and support, limits their resources for\r\n     self-development and weakens their influence on popular thought;\r\n     second, because giving all men the absolute authority to decide\r\n     the social, civil and political status of women, creates a spirit\r\n     of caste, unrepublican in tendency; third, because in depriving\r\n     the State of the united wisdom of man and woman, that important\r\n     \"consensus of the competent,\" our form of government becomes in\r\n     fact an oligarchy of males instead of a republic of the people.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That since the women citizens of the United States\r\n     have thus far failed to receive proper recognition from any of\r\n     the existing political parties, we recommend the appointment by\r\n     this convention of a committee on future political action.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That as there is a general awakening to the rights of\r\n     women in all European countries, the time has arrived to take the\r\n     initiative steps for a grand International Woman Suffrage\r\n     Convention, to be held in either England or America, and that for\r\n     this purpose a committee of three be appointed at this convention\r\n     to correspond with leading persons in different countries\r\n     interested in the elevation of women.\r\n\r\nMiss Couzins submitted the following, which was unanimously accepted:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in the death of Wendell Phillips the nation has\r\n     lost one of its greatest moral heroes, its most eloquent orator\r\n     and honest advocate of justice and equality for all classes; and\r\n     woman in her struggle for enfranchisement has lost in him a\r\n     steadfast friend and wise counselor. His consistency in the\r\n     application of republican principles of government brought him to\r\n     the woman suffrage platform at the inauguration of the movement,\r\n     where he remained faithful to the end. The National Woman\r\n     Suffrage Association in convention assembled, would express their\r\n     gratitude for his brave words for woman before the Legislatures\r\n     of so many States and on so many platforms, both in England and\r\n     America, and would extend their sincere sympathy to her who was\r\n     his constant inspiration to the utterance of the highest truth,\r\n     his noble wife, Ann Green Phillips.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the services of Anna Ella Carroll of Maryland,\r\n     who directed the armies of the republic up the Tennessee river\r\n     and then southward to the center of the Confederate power to its\r\n     base in northern Alabama, cutting the Memphis and Charleston\r\n     railroad and thus breaking the backbone of the rebellion, entitle\r\n     her justly to the name of the military genius of the war; that\r\n     her long struggle for recognition at the hands of our Government\r\n     commends her to the sympathy of all who believe in truth and\r\n     justice; and the continued refusal of the Government to\r\n     acknowledge this woman's service, which saved to us the Union,\r\n     defeated national bankruptcy and prevented the intervention of\r\n     foreign powers, merits the condemnation of all lovers of right,\r\n     and we hereby not only send to her our loving recognition and\r\n     sympathy, but pledge ourselves to arouse this nation to the fact\r\n     of her services.[16]\r\n\r\nThe plan of work submitted by Mrs. Gougar, chairman of the committee,\r\nwas adopted.[17] This was supplemented by suggestions of the national\r\nboard as to methods of organization.[18]\r\n\r\nThe following officers were elected: president, Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton, N. Y.; vice-presidents-at-large, Susan B. Anthony, Matilda\r\nJoslyn Gage, N. Y., the Rev. Olympia Brown, Wis., Phoebe W. Couzins,\r\nMo., Abigail Scott Duniway, Ore.; recording secretaries, Ellen H.\r\nSheldon, D. C., Julia T. Foster, Penn.; Pearl Adams, Ills.;\r\ncorresponding secretary, Rachel G. Foster (Avery), Penn.; foreign\r\ncorresponding secretaries, Caroline Ashurst Biggs, Lydia E. Becker,\r\nEngland; Marguerite Berry Stanton, Hubertine Auclert, France;\r\ntreasurer, Jane H. Spofford, D. C.; auditors, Ruth C. Dennison, Julia\r\nA. Wilbur, D. C.; chairman of executive committee, May Wright Sewall,\r\nInd., and vice-presidents in every State.\r\n\r\nThe financial report showed the receipts for 1884 to be in round\r\nnumbers $2,000, and a balance of $300 still remaining in the treasury.\r\n\r\nIn her address closing the convention Miss Anthony said:\r\n\r\n     The reason men are so slow in conceding political equality to\r\n     women is because they can not believe that women suffer the\r\n     humiliation of disfranchisement as they would. A dear and noble\r\n     friend, one who aided our work most efficiently in the early\r\n     days, said to me, \"Why do you say the 'emancipation of women?'\" I\r\n     replied, \"Because women are political slaves!\" Is it not strange\r\n     that men think that what to them would be degradation, slavery,\r\n     is to women elevation, liberty? Men put the right of suffrage for\r\n     themselves above all price, and count the denial of it the most\r\n     severe punishment. If a man serving a term in State's prison has\r\n     one friend outside who cares for him, that friend will get up a\r\n     petition begging the Governor to commute his sentence, if for not\r\n     more than forty-eight hours prior to its expiration, so that,\r\n     when he comes out of prison he may not be compelled to suffer the\r\n     disgrace of disfranchisement and may not be doomed to walk among\r\n     his fellows with the mark of Cain upon his forehead. The only\r\n     penalty inflicted upon the men, who a few years ago laid the\r\n     knife at the throat of the Nation, was that of disfranchisement,\r\n     which all men, loyal and disloyal, felt was too grievous to be\r\n     borne, and our Government made haste to permit every one, even\r\n     the leader of them all, to escape from this humiliation, this\r\n     degradation, and again to be honored with the crowning right of\r\n     United States citizenship. How can men thus delude themselves\r\n     with the idea that what to them is ignominy unbearable is to\r\n     women honor and glory unspeakable.[19]\r\n\r\nAn able address from Mrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage (N. Y.) arrived too late\r\nfor the convention. It was a denial of the superiority of man from a\r\nscientific standpoint, and was so original in thought that it deserves\r\nto be reproduced almost in full:\r\n\r\n     ....We must bear in mind the old theologic belief that the earth\r\n     was flat, the center of the universe, around which all else\r\n     revolved--that all created things animate and inanimate, were\r\n     made for man alone--that woman was not part of the original plan\r\n     of creation but was an after-thought for man's special use and\r\n     benefit. So that a science which proves the falsity of any of\r\n     these theological conceptions aids in the overthrow of all.\r\n\r\n     The first great battle fought by science for woman was a\r\n     Geographical one lasting for twelve centuries. But finally,\r\n     Columbus, sustained and sent on his way by Isabella in 1492,\r\n     followed by Magellan's circumnavigation of the globe twenty years\r\n     later, settled the question of the earth's rotundity and was the\r\n     first step toward woman's enfranchisement.\r\n\r\n     Another great battle was in progress at the same time and the\r\n     second victory was an Astronomical one. Copernicus was born, the\r\n     telescope discovered, the earth sank to its subordinate place in\r\n     the solar system and another battle for woman was won.\r\n\r\n     Chemistry, long opposed under the name of Alchemy, at last gained\r\n     a victory, and by its union of diverse atoms began to teach men\r\n     that nature is a system of nuptials, and that the feminine is\r\n     everywhere present as an absolute necessity of life.\r\n\r\n     Geology continued this lesson. It not only taught the immense age\r\n     of creation, but the motherhood of even the rocks.\r\n\r\n     Botany was destined for a fierce battle, as when Linnæus declared\r\n     the sexual nature of plants, he was shunned as having degraded\r\n     the works of God by a recognition of the feminine in plant life.\r\n\r\n     Philology owes its rank to Catherine II of Russia, who, in\r\n     assembling her great congress of deputies from the numerous\r\n     provinces of her empire, gave the first impetus to this science.\r\n     Max Müller declares the evidence of language to be irrefragable,\r\n     and it is the only history we possess prior to historic periods.\r\n     Through Philology we ascend to the dawn of nations and learn of\r\n     the domestic, religious and governmental habits of people who\r\n     left neither monuments nor writing to speak for them. From it we\r\n     learn the original meaning of our terms, father and mother.\r\n     Father, says Müller, who is a recognized philological authority,\r\n     is derived from the root \"Pa,\" which means to protect, to\r\n     support, to nourish. Among the earliest Aryans, the word _mater_\r\n     (mother), from the root \"Ma,\" signified maker; creation being\r\n     thus distinctively associated with the feminine. Taylor, in his\r\n     Primitive Culture says the husband acknowledged the offspring of\r\n     his wife as his own as thus only had he a right to claim the\r\n     title of father.\r\n\r\n     While Philology has opened a new fount of historic knowledge,\r\n     Biology, the seventh and most important witness, the latest\r\n     science in opposition to divine authority, is the first to deny\r\n     the theory of man's original perfection. Science gained many\r\n     triumphs, conquered many superstitions, before the world caught a\r\n     glimpse of the result toward which each step was tending--the\r\n     enfranchisement of woman.\r\n\r\n     Through Biology we learn that the first manifestation of life is\r\n     feminine. The albuminous protoplasm lying in silent darkness on\r\n     the bottom of the sea, possessing within itself all the phenomena\r\n     exhibited by the highest forms of life, as sensation, motion,\r\n     nutrition and reproduction, produces its like, and in all forms\r\n     of life the capacity for reproduction undeniably stamps the\r\n     feminine. Not only does science establish the fact that\r\n     primordial life is feminine, but it also proves that a greater\r\n     expenditure of vital force is requisite for the production of the\r\n     feminine than for the masculine.\r\n\r\n     The experiments of Meehan, Gentry, Treat, Herrick, Wallace,\r\n     Combe, Wood and many others, show sex to depend upon environment\r\n     and nutrition. A meager, contracted environment, together with\r\n     innutritious or scanty food, results in a weakened vitality and\r\n     the birth of males; a broad, generous environment together with\r\n     abundant nutrition, in the birth of females. The most perfect\r\n     plant produces feminine flowers; the best nurtured insect or\r\n     animal demonstrates the same law. From every summary of vital\r\n     statistics we gather further proof that more abundant vitality,\r\n     fewer infantile deaths and greater comparative longevity belong\r\n     to woman. It is a recognized fact that quick reaction to a\r\n     stimulus is proof of superior vitality. In England, where very\r\n     complete vital statistics have been recorded for many years, it\r\n     is shown that while the mean duration of man's life within the\r\n     last thirty years has increased five per cent. that of woman has\r\n     increased more than eight per cent. Our own last census (tenth)\r\n     shows New Hampshire to be the State most favorable for longevity.\r\n     While one in seventy-four of its inhabitants is eighty years old,\r\n     among native white men the proportion is but one to eighty, while\r\n     among native white women, the very great preponderance of one to\r\n     fifty-eight is shown.\r\n\r\n     That the vitality of the world is at a depressed standard is\r\n     proven by the fact that more boys are born than girls, the per\r\n     cent. varying in different countries. Male infants are more often\r\n     deformed, suffer from abnormal characteristics, and more speedily\r\n     succumb to infantile diseases than female infants, so that within\r\n     a few years, notwithstanding the large proportion of male births,\r\n     the balance of life is upon the feminine side. Many children are\r\n     born to a rising people, but this biological truth is curiously\r\n     supplemented by the fact that the proportion of girls born among\r\n     such people, is always in excess of boys; while in races dying\r\n     out, the very large proportion of boys' births over those of\r\n     girls is equally noticeable.\r\n\r\n     From these hastily presented scientific facts it is manifest that\r\n     woman possesses in a higher degree than man that adaptation to\r\n     the conditions surrounding her which is everywhere accepted as\r\n     evidence of superior vitality and higher physical rank in life;\r\n     and when biology becomes more fully understood it will also be\r\n     universally acknowledged that the primal creative power, like the\r\n     first manifestation of life, is feminine.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[10] The Call ended as follows: \"The satisfactory results of\r\nUnrestricted Suffrage for Women in Wyoming Territory, of School\r\nSuffrage in twelve States, of Municipal and School Suffrage in England\r\nand Scotland, of Municipal and Parliamentary Suffrage in the Isle of\r\nMan, with the recent triumph in Washington Territory; also the\r\nconstant agitation of the suffrage question in this country and in\r\nEngland, and the demands that women are everywhere making for larger\r\nliberties, are most encouraging signs of the times. This is the\r\nsupreme hour for all who are interested in the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen to dedicate their time and money to the success of this\r\nmovement, and by their generous contributions to strengthen those upon\r\nwhom rests the responsibility of carrying forward this beneficent\r\nreform.\r\n\r\n                              \"ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, President.\r\n                              \"SUSAN B.

It is the story of a national disgrace.\r\n\r\n[17] _Resolved_, That we hold a convention in every unorganized State\r\nand Territory during the present year, as far as possible, at the\r\ncapital.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we consider the enfranchisement of the women citizens\r\nof the United States the paramount issue of the hour, therefore\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we will, by all honorable methods, oppose the\r\nelection of any presidential candidate who is a known opponent to\r\nwoman suffrage, and we recommend similar action on the part of our\r\nState associations in regard to State and congressional candidates and\r\nfurther\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the officers of this convention shall communicate\r\nwith presidential nominees of the several political parties and\r\nascertain their position upon this question.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That all Legislatures shall be requested to memorialize\r\nCongress upon the submission of a Sixteenth Amendment to the\r\nConstitution, this to be the duty of the vice presidents of the States\r\nand Territories.\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, The National Government, through Congress and the Supreme\r\nCourt, has persistently refused to protect the women of the several\r\nStates and Territories in \"the right of the citizen to vote,\"\r\ntherefore\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That this association most earnestly protests against\r\nnational interference to abolish the right where it has been secured\r\nby the Legislature--as, for example, the Edmunds Tucker Bill, which\r\nproposes to disfranchise all the women of Utah, thus inflicting the\r\nmost degrading penalty upon the innocent equally with the guilty, by\r\nrobbing them of their most sacred right of citizenship.\r\n\r\n[18] The method of organization must be governed by circumstances. In\r\nsome localities it is best to call a public meeting, in others to\r\ninvite the friends of the movement to a private conference. Both women\r\nand men should be members and co-operate, and the society should be\r\norganized on as broad and liberal a basis as possible.\r\n\r\nHold conventions, picnics, teas, and occasionally have a lecture from\r\nsome one who will draw a large crowd. Utilize your own talent,\r\nencourage your young women and men to speak, read essays and debate on\r\nthe question. Hold public celebrations of the birthdays of eminent\r\nwomen, and in that way interest many who would not attend a pronounced\r\nsuffrage meeting.\r\n\r\nPersons who can not be induced to attend a public meeting will often\r\naccept an invitation to a parlor conference or entertainment where\r\nwoman suffrage can be made the subject of conversation. Cultured women\r\nand men, who \"have given the matter no thought,\" can be interested\r\nthrough a paper presenting the life and work of such women as Margaret\r\nFuller, Abigail Adams, Lucretia Mott, etc., or showing the rise and\r\nprogress of the woman suffrage movement, giving short biographies of\r\nthe leaders.\r\n\r\nAdvocate suffrage through your local papers. Send them short, pithy\r\ncommunications, and, when possible, secure a column in each, to be\r\nedited by the society.\r\n\r\nInvite pastors of churches to select from the numerous appropriate\r\ntexts in the Bible and preach occasionally upon this subject.\r\n\r\nA strong effort should be made to circulate literature. Every society\r\nshould own a copy of the Woman Question in Europe, by Theodore\r\nStanton, of the History of Woman Suffrage, by Mrs. Stanton, Miss\r\nAnthony and Mrs. Gage, of Mrs. Robinson's Massachusetts in the Woman\r\nSuffrage Movement, of T. W. Higginson's Common Sense for Women, of\r\nJohn Stuart Mill's Subjection of Women, and of Frances Power Cobbe's\r\nDuties of Women. These will furnish ammunition for arguments and\r\ndebates.\r\n\r\nSuffrage leaflets should be circulated in parlors and places of\r\nbusiness, and \"pockets\" should be filled and hung in railroad\r\nstations, post-offices and hotels, that \"he who runs may read.\" Over\r\nthese should be printed \"Woman Suffrage--Take and Read.\"\r\n\r\nAll the above methods aim rather at the education of the popular mind\r\nthan the judiciary and legislative branches of the Government. The\r\nnext step is to educate the representatives in Congress and on the\r\nbench of the Supreme Court in the principles of constitutional law and\r\nrepublican government, that they may understand the justice of the\r\ndemands for a Sixteenth Amendment which shall forbid the several\r\nStates to deny or abridge the rights of women citizens of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[19] Miss Anthony never wrote her addresses and no stenographic\r\nreports were made. Brief and inadequate newspaper accounts are all\r\nthat remain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\nCONGRESSIONAL HEARINGS AND REPORTS OF 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nBoth Senate and House of the preceding Congress had appointed Select\r\nCommittees on Woman Suffrage to whom all petitions, etc., were\r\nreferred.[20] The Senate of the Forty-eighth Congress renewed this\r\ncommittee, but the House declined to do so. Early in the session, Dec.\r\n19, 1883, the Committee on Rules refused to report such a committee\r\nbut authorized Speaker Warren Keifer of Ohio to present the question\r\nto the House. A spirited debate followed which displayed the sentiment\r\nof members against the question of woman suffrage itself. John H.\r\nReagan of Texas was the principal opponent, saying in the course of\r\nhis remarks:\r\n\r\n     I hope that it will not be considered ungracious in me that I\r\n     oppose the wish of any lady. But when she so far misunderstands\r\n     her duty as to want to go to working on the roads and making\r\n     rails and serving in the militia and going into the army, I want\r\n     to protect her against it. I do not think that sort of employment\r\n     suits her sex or her physical strength. I think also, when we\r\n     attempt to overturn the social status of the world as it has\r\n     existed for six thousand years, we ought to begin somewhere where\r\n     we have a constitutional basis to stand upon....\r\n\r\n     But I suppose whoever clamors for action here finds a warrant for\r\n     it in the clamor outside, and it is not necessary to look to the\r\n     Constitution for it; it is not necessary to regard the interests\r\n     of civilization and the experience of ages in determining our\r\n     social as well as our political policy; but we will arrange it so\r\n     that there shall be no one to nurse the babies, no one to\r\n     superintend the household, but all shall go into the political\r\n     scramble, and we shall go back as rapidly as we can march into\r\n     barbarism. That is the effect of such doings as this,\r\n     disregarding the social interests of society for a clamor that\r\n     never ought to have been made.\r\n\r\nMr. Reagan then rambled into a long discussion of the rights allowed\r\nunder the Constitution, although no action had been proposed except\r\nthe mere appointment of a Select Committee, to whom all questions\r\nrelating to woman suffrage might be referred, such as already existed\r\nin the Senate.\r\n\r\nJames B. Belford of Colorado in an able reply said:\r\n\r\n     I have no doubt that this House will be gratified with the\r\n     profound respect which the gentleman from Texas has expressed for\r\n     the Constitution of the country. The last distinguished act with\r\n     which he was connected was its attempted overthrow; and a man who\r\n     was engaged in an enterprise of that kind can fight a class to\r\n     whom his mother belonged. I desire to know whether a woman is a\r\n     citizen of the United States or an outcast without any political\r\n     rights whatever....\r\n\r\n     What is the proposition presented by the gentleman from Ohio?\r\n     That we will constitute a committee to whom shall be referred all\r\n     petitions presented by women. Is not the right of petition a\r\n     constitutional right? Has not woman, in this country at least,\r\n     risen above the horizon of servitude, discredit and disgrace, and\r\n     has she not a right, representing as she does in many instances\r\n     great questions of property, to present her appeals to this\r\n     National Council and have them judiciously considered? I think it\r\n     is due to our wives, daughters, mothers and sisters to afford\r\n     them an avenue through which they can legitimately and judicially\r\n     reach the ear of this great nation.\r\n\r\nMoved by Mr. Reagan's attacks, Mr. Keifer made a strong plea for the\r\nrights of women, which deserves a place in history, saying in part:\r\n\r\n     We must remember that we stand here committed in a large sense to\r\n     the matter of woman suffrage. In the Territories of Wyoming and\r\n     Utah for fifteen years past women have had the right to vote on\r\n     all questions which men can vote upon; and the Congress of the\r\n     United States has stood by without disapproving the legislative\r\n     acts of those Territories. And we now have before us a law passed\r\n     at the last session of the Legislature of Washington, giving to\r\n     its women the right to vote. We have not passed upon the question\r\n     one way or the other, but we have the right to pass upon it.\r\n     This, I think, seems to dispose sufficiently of the question of\r\n     constitutional legislative power without trampling upon the toes\r\n     of any State-rights man.\r\n\r\n     The right of petition belongs to all persons within the limits of\r\n     our republic, and with the right of petition goes the right on\r\n     the part of the Congress through constitutional means to grant\r\n     relief. Do gentlemen claim it is unconstitutional to amend the\r\n     Constitution? I know that claim was made at one time on the floor\r\n     of this House and on the floor of the Senate. When it was\r\n     proposed to abolish slavery in the United States, distinguished\r\n     gentlemen argued that it was unconstitutional to amend the\r\n     Constitution so as to abolish slavery. But all that has passed\r\n     away and we now find ourselves, in the light of the present,\r\n     seeing clearly that we may amend the Constitution in any way we\r\n     please, pursuing always the proper constitutional methods of\r\n     doing so.\r\n\r\n     There are considerations due to the women of this country which\r\n     ought not to be lightly thrust aside. For thirty-five years they\r\n     have been petitioning and holding conventions and demanding that\r\n     certain relief should be granted them, to the extent of allowing\r\n     them to exercise the right of suffrage. In that thirty-five years\r\n     we have seen great things accomplished. We have seen some of the\r\n     subtleties of the Common Law, which were spread over this\r\n     country, swept away. There is hardly anybody anywhere who now\r\n     adheres to the doctrine that a married woman can not make a\r\n     contract, and that she has no rights or liabilities except those\r\n     which are centered in her husband. Even the old Common-Law maxim\r\n     that \"husband and wife are one, and that one the husband,\" has\r\n     been largely modified under the influence of these patriotic,\r\n     earnest ladies who have taken hold of this question and\r\n     enlightened the world upon it. There are now in the vaults of\r\n     this Capitol _hundreds of thousands of petitions_ for relief,\r\n     sent in here by women and by those who believed that women ought\r\n     to have certain rights and privileges of citizenship granted to\r\n     them. For sixteen years there has been held in this city,\r\n     annually, a convention composed of representative women from all\r\n     parts of the country. These conventions, as well as various State\r\n     and local conventions, have been appealing for relief; and they\r\n     ought not to be met by the statement that we will not even give\r\n     them the poor privilege of a committee to whom their petitions\r\n     and memorials may be referred.\r\n\r\n     We have made some progress. In 1871 there was a very strong\r\n     minority report made in this House in favor of woman suffrage.\r\n     Notwithstanding the notion that we must stand by all our old\r\n     ideas, the Supreme Court of the United States, after deliberately\r\n     considering the question, admitted a woman to practice at the bar\r\n     of that Court.[21] A hundred years ago, in the darkness of which\r\n     some gentlemen desire still to live, I suppose they would not\r\n     have done this. Favorable reports on this subject were made by\r\n     the Committee on Privileges and Elections in the Senate of the\r\n     Forty-fifth Congress, and in the last Congress by a Select\r\n     Committee of the Senate and of the House. The Legislatures of\r\n     many of the States have expressed their judgment on the matter.\r\n     There has been a great deal of progress in that direction. The\r\n     Senate and the House of Representatives of the last Congress\r\n     provided Select Committees to whom all matters relating to woman\r\n     suffrage could be referred. Will this House take a step backward\r\n     on this question?\r\n\r\n     I want especially to notify the gentleman from Texas that we are\r\n     not standing still on this matter. Eleven States--New Hampshire,\r\n     Vermont, Massachusetts, New York, Michigan, Kentucky, Minnesota,\r\n     Nebraska, Kansas, Colorado and Oregon--have authorized women to\r\n     vote for school trustees and members of school boards. Kentucky\r\n     extends this right to widows who have children and pay taxes.\r\n     Women are nominated and voted for not only in the eleven States\r\n     and three Territories, but in nearly all the Northern and Western\r\n     States. Pennsylvania, Illinois, Iowa and other States have large\r\n     numbers of women county superintendents of public schools. And\r\n     let me say, for the benefit of the Democratic party, that in the\r\n     great, progressive western State of Kansas the Democracy rose so\r\n     high as to nominate and vote for a woman for State Superintendent\r\n     of Public Instruction at the last election. So there has been a\r\n     little growing away from those old ideas and notions, even among\r\n     the Democracy. We are permitting women to fill public offices.\r\n     Why should they not participate in the election of officers who\r\n     are to govern them? We require them to pay taxes and there are a\r\n     great many burdens imposed upon them. Kansas, Michigan, Colorado\r\n     and Nebraska have in recent years submitted the question of woman\r\n     suffrage to a vote of the people and more than one-third of the\r\n     electors of each voted in favor. Oregon has now a similar\r\n     proposition pending.\r\n\r\n     By the laws of all the States women are required to pay taxes;\r\n     but we are practically working on the theory that these women\r\n     shall be taxed without the right of representation. Taxation\r\n     without representation led to the separation of the colonies from\r\n     the mother country. They were not so much opposed to being taxed\r\n     as they were to being taxed without representation. The patriots\r\n     of that day conceived the idea that there was a principle\r\n     somewhere involved in the right of representation. So they\r\n     evolved and formulated that Revolutionary maxim, \"Millions for\r\n     defense, but not one cent for tribute.\" The basis of that maxim\r\n     was that they would not give to the payment of taxes without the\r\n     right of representation. Revolution and war made representation\r\n     and taxation correlative. But the States tax all women on their\r\n     property. For illustration, 8,000 women of Boston and 34,000 in\r\n     Massachusetts pay $2,000,000 of taxes, one-eleventh of the entire\r\n     tax of that great and wealthy State. The same ratio will be found\r\n     to prevail in all the other States.\r\n\r\n     Progress has gone on elsewhere than in the United States. England\r\n     has been moving forward in this matter, and we should not stand\r\n     behind her in anything....\r\n\r\n     I am one of those who do not believe that to give to women common\r\n     rights and privileges will degrade them, but on the contrary I\r\n     believe it will ennoble them; and I believe further that to put\r\n     them on an equality in the matter of rights and privileges with\r\n     men will enhance their charms and not lessen their beauty.\r\n\r\nThe vote resulted--yeas, 85; nays, 124; not voting, 112. Of the\r\naffirmative votes 72 were Republican, 13 Democratic; of the negative,\r\n4 were Republican, 120 Democratic.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1884, after the return of the members from their holiday\r\nrecess, Miss Anthony addressed letters to the 112 absentees, asking\r\neach how he would have voted had he been present. Fifty-two replies\r\nwere received, 26 from Republicans, all of whom would have voted yes;\r\n26 from Democrats, 10 of whom would have voted yes, 10, no, and 6\r\ncould not tell which way they would have voted.\r\n\r\nIn the hope that this respectable minority could be increased to a\r\nmajority, the Hon. John D. White (Ky.) made a further attempt, Feb. 7,\r\n1884, to secure the desired committee, saying in his speech upon this\r\nquestion:\r\n\r\n     It seems to me to be an anomalous state of affairs that in a\r\n     great Nation like this one-half of the people should have no\r\n     committee to which they could address their appeals.\r\n\r\n     Women consider they have the same political rights as men. I\r\n     might read from such distinguished authority as Miss Susan B.\r\n     Anthony, whose name has been jeered in her native State, and who\r\n     has been prosecuted there for voting, but who stands before the\r\n     American people to-day the peer of any woman in the nation, and\r\n     the superior of half the men occupying a representative capacity.\r\n     It does seem to me hard that when a woman like this comes to\r\n     Congress, instructed by thousands and tens of thousands of her\r\n     sex, in order to be heard she should be compelled to hang around\r\n     the doors of the Judiciary Committee, or of some other committee,\r\n     pre-eminently occupied with other matters. But we are told there\r\n     is no room. Yet we have a room where lobbyists of every sort are\r\n     provided for. And are we to be told that no room in this wing of\r\n     the Capitol can be had where respectable women of the nation can\r\n     present arguments for the calm consideration of their friends in\r\n     this body? I ask simply for the opportunity to be afforded the\r\n     representatives of the political rights of women to be heard in\r\n     making respectful argument to the law-making power of the nation.\r\n\r\nByron M. Cutcheon (Mich.) also spoke in favor of the committee,\r\nsaying:\r\n\r\n     Ever since the organization of this House I have received\r\n     petitions from my constituents in regard to this matter of the\r\n     political rights of women, but there seems to be no committee to\r\n     which they could properly be referred. A few years since, when\r\n     this question of woman suffrage was submitted to the people in my\r\n     State, more than 40,000 electors were in favor of it. It seems to\r\n     me, without committing ourselves on the question of the political\r\n     rights of women, it is but respectful to a very large number of\r\n     people in all our States that there should be a committee to\r\n     receive and consider and report upon these petitions which come\r\n     to us from time to time.\r\n\r\nThe House refused to allow a vote.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Committee on Woman Suffrage granted a hearing March 7,\r\n1884, at 10:30 a. m., in the Senate reception room, to the speakers\r\nand delegates in attendance at the convention, the entire committee\r\nbeing present.[22] In introducing the speakers Miss Anthony said:\r\n\"This is the sixteenth year that we have come before Congress in\r\nperson, and the nineteenth by petitions, asking national protection\r\nfor the citizen's right to vote, when the citizen happens to be a\r\nwoman.\"\r\n\r\n     MRS. HARRIET R. SHATTUCK (Mass.): We canvassed four localities in\r\n     the city of Boston, two in smaller cities, two in country\r\n     districts and made one record also of school teachers in nine\r\n     schools of one town. The teachers were unanimously in favor of\r\n     woman suffrage, and in the nine localities we found that the\r\n     proportion of women in favor was very much larger than of those\r\n     opposed. The total of women canvassed was 814. Those in favor\r\n     were 405, those opposed, 44; indifferent, 166; refused to sign,\r\n     160; not seen, 39. These canvasses were made by respectable,\r\n     responsible women, and they swore before a Justice of the Peace\r\n     as to the truth of their statements. Thus we have in\r\n     Massachusetts this reliable canvass of women showing those in\r\n     favor are to those opposed as nine to one....\r\n\r\n     MRS. MAY WRIGHT SEWALL (Ind.): ... My friend has said that men\r\n     have always kept us just a little below them where they could\r\n     shower upon us favors and they have done that generously. So they\r\n     have, but, gentlemen, has your sex been more generous to women\r\n     than they have been generous toward you in their favors? Neither\r\n     can dispense with the service of the other, neither can dispense\r\n     with the reverence of the other or with the aid of the other in\r\n     social life. The men of this nation are rapidly finding that they\r\n     can not dispense with the service of woman in business life. I\r\n     know that they are also feeling the need of the moral support of\r\n     woman in their political life.\r\n\r\n     You, gentlemen, by lifting the women of the nation into political\r\n     equality would simply place us where we could lift you where you\r\n     never yet have stood--upon a moral equality with us. I do not\r\n     speak to you as individuals but as the representatives of your\r\n     sex, as I stand here the representative of mine, and never until\r\n     we are your equals politically will the moral standard for men be\r\n     what it now is for women, and it is none too high. Let woman's\r\n     standard be still more elevated, and let yours come up to match\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     We do not appeal to you as Republicans or as Democrats. We were\r\n     reared with our brothers under the political belief and faith of\r\n     our fathers, and probably as much influenced by that rearing as\r\n     they were. We shall go to strengthen both the parties, neither\r\n     the one nor the other the more, probably. So this is not a\r\n     partisan measure; it is a just measure, which is our due, because\r\n     of what we are, men and women both, by virtue of our heritage and\r\n     our one Father, our one Mother eternal.\r\n\r\n     MRS. HELEN M. GOUGAR (Ind.): I maintain there is no political\r\n     question paramount to that of woman suffrage before the people of\r\n     America to-day. Political parties would have us believe that\r\n     tariff is the great question of the hour. It is an insult to the\r\n     intelligence of the present to say that when one-half of the\r\n     citizens of this republic are denied a direct voice in making the\r\n     laws under which they shall live, that the tariff, the civil\r\n     rights of the negro, or any other question which can be brought\r\n     up, is equal to the one of giving political freedom to women.\r\n\r\n     I ask you to let me have a voice in the laws under which I shall\r\n     live because the older empires of the earth are sending to the\r\n     United States a population drawn very largely from their asylums,\r\n     penitentiaries, jails and poor-houses. They are emptying those\r\n     men upon our shores, and within a few months they are intrusted\r\n     with the ballot, the law-making power in this republic, and they\r\n     and their representatives are seated in official and legislative\r\n     positions. I, as an American-born woman, enter my protest at\r\n     being compelled to live under laws made by this class of men\r\n     while I am denied the protection that can only come from the\r\n     ballot. While I would not have you take this right from those men\r\n     whom we invite to our shores, I do ask you, in the face of this\r\n     immense foreign immigration, to enfranchise the tax-paying,\r\n     intelligent, moral, native-born women of America.\r\n\r\n     ....We have in our State the signatures of over 5,000 of the\r\n     school teachers asking for woman's ballot. I ask you if the\r\n     Government does not need the voice of those 5,000 educated\r\n     teachers as much as it needs the voice of the 240 criminals who\r\n     are, on an average, sent out of the penitentiary of Indiana each\r\n     year, to go to the ballot-box upon every question, and make laws\r\n     under which those teachers must live, and under which the mothers\r\n     of our State must keep their homes and rear their children?\r\n\r\n     On behalf of the mothers of this country I demand that their\r\n     hands shall be loosened before the ballot-box, and that they\r\n     shall have the privilege of throwing the mother heart into the\r\n     laws which shall follow their sons not only to the age of\r\n     majority, but even after their hair has turned gray and they have\r\n     seats in the United States Congress; yes, to the very confines of\r\n     eternity. This can be done in no indirect way; it can not be done\r\n     by silent influence; it can not be done by prayer. While I do not\r\n     underestimate the power of prayer, I say give me my ballot with\r\n     which to send statesmen instead of modern politicians into our\r\n     legislative halls. I would rather have that ballot on election\r\n     day than the prayers of all the disfranchised women in the\r\n     universe!\r\n\r\n     ....Our forefathers did not object to taxation, but they did\r\n     object to taxation without representation, and we object to it.\r\n     We are willing to contribute our share to the support of this\r\n     Government, as we always have done; but we demand our little yes\r\n     and no in the form of the ballot so that we shall have a direct\r\n     influence in distributing the taxes.\r\n\r\n     I am amenable to the gallows and the penitentiary, and it is no\r\n     more than right that I shall have a voice in framing the laws\r\n     under which I shall be rewarded or punished. It is written in the\r\n     law of every State in this Union that a person tried in the\r\n     courts shall have a jury of his peers; yet so long as the word\r\n     \"male\" stands as it does in the Constitution of the United States\r\n     and the States, no woman can have a jury of her peers. I protest\r\n     in the name of justice against going into the court-room and\r\n     being compelled to run the gauntlet of the gutter and\r\n     saloon--yes, even of the police court and of the jail--as is done\r\n     in selecting a male jury to try the interests of woman, whether\r\n     relating to life, property or reputation....\r\n\r\n     The political party that presumes to fight the moral battles of\r\n     the future must have the women in its ranks. We are non-partisan.\r\n     We come as Democrats, Republicans, Prohibitionists and\r\n     Green-backers, and if there were half a dozen other political\r\n     parties some of us would affiliate with them. We ask this\r\n     beneficent action upon your part, because we believe the\r\n     intelligence and justice of the hour demand it. We ask you in the\r\n     name of equity and humanity alone, and not in that of any\r\n     party....\r\n\r\n     You ask us if we are impatient. Yes; we are impatient. Some of us\r\n     may die, and I want our grand old standard-bearer, Susan B.\r\n     Anthony, whose name will go down to history beside those of\r\n     George Washington, Abraham Lincoln and Wendell Phillips--I want\r\n     that woman to go to Heaven a free angel from this republic. The\r\n     power lies in your hands to make all women free.\r\n\r\n     MRS. CAROLINE GILKEY ROGERS (N. Y.): It is often said to us that\r\n     when _all_ the women ask for the ballot it will be granted. Did\r\n     _all_ the married women petition the Legislatures of their States\r\n     to secure to them the right to hold in their own name the\r\n     property which belonged to them? To secure to the poor forsaken\r\n     wife the right to her earnings? _All_ the women did not ask for\r\n     these rights, but _all_ accepted them with joy and gladness when\r\n     they were obtained, and so it will be with the franchise. Woman's\r\n     right to self-government does not depend upon the numbers that\r\n     demand it, but upon precisely the same principles on which man\r\n     claims it for himself. Where did man get the authority which he\r\n     now exercises to govern one-half of humanity; from what power the\r\n     right to place woman, his helpmeet in life, in an inferior\r\n     position? Came it from nature? Nature made woman his superior\r\n     when it made her his mother--his equal when it fitted her to hold\r\n     the sacred position of wife. Did women meet in council and\r\n     voluntarily give up all their right to be their own law-makers?\r\n     The power of the strong over the weak makes man the master. Thus,\r\n     and thus only, does he gain the authority.\r\n\r\n     It is all very well to say, \"Convert the women.\" While we most\r\n     heartily wish they could all feel as we do, yet when it comes to\r\n     the decision of this great question they are mere ciphers, for if\r\n     it is settled by the States it will be left to the men, not to\r\n     the women, to decide. Or if suffrage comes to women through a\r\n     Sixteenth Amendment to the National Constitution, it will be\r\n     decided by Legislatures elected by men only. In neither case will\r\n     women have an opportunity of passing upon the question. So reason\r\n     tells us we must devote our best efforts to converting those to\r\n     whom we must look for the removal of the barriers which now\r\n     prevent our exercising the right of suffrage....\r\n\r\n     MRS. MARY SEYMOUR HOWELL (N. Y.): We ask for the ballot for the\r\n     good of the race. Huxley says: \"Admitting, for the sake of\r\n     argument, that woman is the weaker, mentally and physically, for\r\n     that very reason she should have the ballot and every help which\r\n     the world can give her.\" When you debar from your councils and\r\n     legislative halls the purity, the spirituality and the love of\r\n     woman, then those councils are apt to become coarse and brutal.\r\n     God gave us to you to help you in this little journey to a better\r\n     land, and by our love and our intellect to help make our country\r\n     pure and noble, and if you would have statesmen you must have\r\n     stateswomen to bear them....\r\n\r\n     MRS. LILLIE DEVEREUX BLAKE (N. Y.): It is often said that we have\r\n     too many voters; that the aggregate of vice and ignorance among\r\n     us should not be increased by giving women the right of suffrage.\r\n     In the enormous immigration which pours upon our shores every\r\n     year, numbering nearly half a million, there come twice as many\r\n     men as women. What does this mean? It means a constant\r\n     preponderance of the masculine over the feminine; and it means\r\n     also, of course, a preponderance of the voting power of the\r\n     foreign men as compared to the native born men. To those who fear\r\n     that our American institutions are threatened by this gigantic\r\n     inroad of foreigners, I commend the reflection that the best\r\n     safeguard against any such preponderance of foreign influence is\r\n     to put the ballot in the hands of the American born woman, and of\r\n     all other women also, so that if the foreign born man\r\n     overbalances us in numbers we shall be always in a majority on\r\n     the side of the liberty which is secured by our institutions....\r\n\r\n     MRS. ELIZABETH BOYNTON HARBERT: From the great State of Illinois\r\n     I come, representing 200,000 men and women of that State who have\r\n     recorded their written petitions for woman's ballot, 90,000 of\r\n     these being citizens under the law, male voters; those 90,000\r\n     have signed petitions for the right of woman to vote on the\r\n     temperance question; 90,000 women also signed those petitions;\r\n     50,000 men and women signed the petitions for the school vote,\r\n     and 60,000 more have signed petitions that the full right of\r\n     suffrage might be accorded to woman.\r\n\r\n     This growth of public sentiment has been occasioned by the needs\r\n     of the children and the working women of that great State. I come\r\n     here to ask you to make a niche in the statesmanship and\r\n     legislation of the nation for the domestic interests of the\r\n     people. You recognize that the masculine thought is more often\r\n     turned to material and political interests. I claim that the\r\n     mother-thought, the woman-element needed, is to supplement the\r\n     statesmanship of American men on political and industrial affairs\r\n     with domestic legislation.\r\n\r\nIn her closing address Miss Anthony took up the question of obtaining\r\nsuffrage for women through the States instead of Congress and said:\r\n\r\n     My answer is that I do not wish to see the women of the\r\n     thirty-eight States of this Union compelled to leave their homes\r\n     to canvass each one of these, school district by school district.\r\n     It is asking too much of a moneyless class. The joint earnings of\r\n     the marriage co-partnership in all the States belong legally to\r\n     the husband. It is only that wife who goes outside the home to\r\n     work whom the law permits to own and control the money she earns.\r\n     Therefore, to ask of women, the vast majority of whom are without\r\n     an independent dollar of their own, to make a thorough canvass of\r\n     their several States, is asking an impossibility.\r\n\r\n     We have already made the experiment of canvassing four\r\n     States--Kansas in 1867, Michigan in 1874, Colorado in 1877,\r\n     Nebraska in 1882--and in each, with the best campaign possible\r\n     for us to make, we obtained a vote of only one-third. One man out\r\n     of every three voted for the enfranchisement of the women of his\r\n     household, while two out of every three voted against it....\r\n\r\n     We beg, therefore, that instead of insisting that a majority of\r\n     the individual voters must be converted before women shall have\r\n     the franchise, you will give us the more hopeful task of\r\n     appealing to the representative men in the Legislatures of the\r\n     several States. You need not fear that we shall get suffrage too\r\n     quickly if Congress submits the proposition, for even then we\r\n     shall have a long siege in going from Legislature to Legislature\r\n     to secure the vote of three-fourths of the States necessary to\r\n     ratify the amendment. It may require twenty years after Congress\r\n     has taken the initiative step, to obtain action by the requisite\r\n     number, but once submitted by Congress it always will stand until\r\n     ratified by the States.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton's paper on Self-Government the Best Means\r\nof Self-Development was read to the committee. A few extracts will\r\nserve to show its broad scope:\r\n\r\n     The basic idea of a republic is the right of self-government, the\r\n     right of every citizen to choose his own representatives and to\r\n     have a voice in the laws under which he lives. As this right can\r\n     be secured only by the exercise of the suffrage, the ballot in\r\n     the hand of every qualified citizen constitutes the true\r\n     political status of the people in a republic.\r\n\r\n     The right of suffrage is simply the right to govern one's self.\r\n     Every human being is born into the world with this right, and the\r\n     desire to exercise it comes naturally with the feeling of life's\r\n     responsibilities. Those only who are capable of appreciating this\r\n     dignity, can measure the extent to which women are defrauded, and\r\n     they only can measure the loss to the councils of the nation of\r\n     the wisdom of representative women. They who say that women do\r\n     not desire the right of suffrage, that they prefer masculine\r\n     domination to self-government, falsify every page of history,\r\n     every fact in human experience.\r\n\r\n     It has taken the whole power of the civil and canon law to hold\r\n     woman in the subordinate position which it is said she willingly\r\n     accepts. If woman naturally has no will, no self-assertion, no\r\n     opinions of her own, what means the terrible persecution of the\r\n     sex under all forms of religious fanaticism, culminating in\r\n     witchcraft in which scarce one wizard to a thousand witches was\r\n     sacrificed? So powerful and merciless has been the struggle to\r\n     dominate the feminine element in humanity, that we may well\r\n     wonder at the steady, determined resistance maintained by woman\r\n     through the centuries. To every step of progress which she has\r\n     made from slavery to the partial freedom she now enjoys, the\r\n     Church and the State alike have made the most cruel opposition,\r\n     and yet, under all circumstances she has shown her love of\r\n     individual freedom, her desire for self-government, while her\r\n     achievements in practical affairs and her courage in the great\r\n     emergencies of life have vindicated her capacity to exercise this\r\n     right....\r\n\r\n     The right of suffrage in a republic means self-government, and\r\n     self-government means education, development, self-reliance,\r\n     independence, courage in the hour of danger. That women may\r\n     attain these virtues we demand the exercise of this right. Not\r\n     that we suppose we should at once be transformed into a higher\r\n     order of beings with all the elements of sovereignty, wisdom,\r\n     goodness and power full-fledged, but because the exercise of the\r\n     suffrage is the primary school in which the citizen learns how to\r\n     use the ballot as a weapon of defense; it is the open sesame to\r\n     the land of freedom and equality. The ballot is the scepter of\r\n     power in the hand of every citizen. Woman can never have an equal\r\n     chance with man in the struggle of life until she too wields this\r\n     power. So long as women have no voice in the Government under\r\n     which they live they will be an ostracised class, and invidious\r\n     distinctions will be made against them in the world of work.\r\n     Thrown on their own resources they have all the hardships that\r\n     men have to encounter in earning their daily bread, with the\r\n     added disabilities which grow out of disfranchisement. Men of the\r\n     republic, why make life harder for your daughters by these\r\n     artificial distinctions? Surely, if governments were made to\r\n     protect the weak against the strong, they are in greater need\r\n     than your stalwart sons of every political right which can give\r\n     them protection, dignity and power....\r\n\r\n     The disfranchisement of one-half the people places a dangerous\r\n     power in the hands of the other half. All history shows that one\r\n     class never did legislate with justice for another, and all\r\n     philosophy shows they never can, as the relations of class grow\r\n     out of either natural or artificial advantages which one has over\r\n     the other and which it will maintain if possible. It is folly to\r\n     say that women are not a class, so long as there is any\r\n     difference in the code of laws for men and women, any\r\n     discrimination in the customs of society, giving advantages to\r\n     men over women; so long as in all our State constitutions women\r\n     are ranked with lunatics, idiots, paupers and criminals. When you\r\n     say that one-half the people shall be governed by the other half,\r\n     surely the class distinction is about as broad as it can be....\r\n\r\n     The disfranchisement of one-half the people deprives the State of\r\n     the united wisdom of man and woman--that \"consensus of the\r\n     competent\" so necessary in national affairs--making our\r\n     Government an oligarchy of males, instead of a republic of the\r\n     people, thus perpetuating with all its evils a dominant masculine\r\n     civilization. But in answer to this it is said that although\r\n     women do not vote, yet they have an indirect influence in\r\n     Government through their husbands and brothers. Yes, an\r\n     \"irresponsible power,\" of all kinds of influence the most\r\n     dangerous....\r\n\r\n     The dogged, unreasonable persecutions of sex in all ages, the\r\n     evident determination to eliminate, as far as possible, the\r\n     feminine element in humanity, has been the most fruitful cause of\r\n     the moral chaos the race has suffered, under every form of\r\n     government and religion.... The loss to women themselves of the\r\n     highest development of which they are capable is sad, but when\r\n     this involves a lower type of manhood and danger to our free\r\n     institutions, it is still more sad. The primal work in every\r\n     country, for its own safety, should be the education and freedom\r\n     of woman.\r\n\r\nThe arguments before the Judiciary Committee of the House were given\r\nthe next morning, March 8, twelve of the fifteen members being\r\npresent.[23] Miss Anthony opened the hearing with an earnest address\r\nin which she referred to the hundreds of thousands of petitions which\r\nhad been sent to Congress for woman suffrage--far more than for any\r\nother measure--and continued:\r\n\r\n     Negro suffrage was again and again overwhelmingly voted down in\r\n     various States--New York, Connecticut, Ohio, etc.--and you know,\r\n     gentlemen, that if the negro had never had the right to vote\r\n     until the majority of the rank and file of white men,\r\n     particularly foreign-born men, had voted \"Yes,\" he would have\r\n     gone without it till the crack of doom. It was because of the\r\n     prejudice of the unthinking majority that Congress submitted the\r\n     question of the negro's enfranchisement to the Legislatures of\r\n     the several States, to be adjudicated by the educated, broadened\r\n     representatives of the people. We now appeal to you to lift the\r\n     decision of woman suffrage from the vote of the populace to that\r\n     of the Legislatures, that you may thereby be as considerate, as\r\n     just, to the women of this nation as you were to the male\r\n     ex-slaves.\r\n\r\n     Every new privilege granted to women has been by the\r\n     Legislatures. The liberal laws for married women, the right of\r\n     the wife to own and control her inherited property and separate\r\n     earnings, the right of women to vote at school elections in a\r\n     dozen States, the right to vote on all questions in three\r\n     Territories, have all been gained through the Legislatures. Had\r\n     any one of these beneficent propositions been submitted to the\r\n     masses, do you believe a majority would have placed their\r\n     sanction upon them? I do not.\r\n\r\n     It takes all too many of us women, and too much of our hard\r\n     earnings, from our homes and from the works of charity and\r\n     education of our respective localities, even to come to\r\n     Washington, session after session, until Congress shall have\r\n     submitted the proposition, and then to go from Legislature to\r\n     Legislature, urging its adoption; but when you insist that we\r\n     shall beg at the feet of each and every individual voter of each\r\n     and every one of the thirty-eight States, native and foreign,\r\n     white and black, educated and ignorant, you doom us to\r\n     incalculable hardships and sacrifices and to most exasperating\r\n     insults and humiliations. I pray you, therefore, save us from the\r\n     fate of working and waiting for our freedom until we shall have\r\n     educated the masses of men to consent to give their wives and\r\n     sisters equality of rights with themselves. You surely will not\r\n     compel us to wait the enlightenment of all the freedmen of this\r\n     nation and all the newly-made voters from the monarchial\r\n     governments of the Old World!\r\n\r\n     Liberty for one's self is a natural instinct possessed alike by\r\n     all, but to be willing to accord liberty to another is the result\r\n     of education, of self-discipline, of the practice of the golden\r\n     rule--\"Do unto others as you would that others should do unto\r\n     you.\" Therefore we ask that the question of equality of rights to\r\n     women shall be arbitrated upon by the picked men of the nation in\r\n     Congress, and the picked men of the several States in their\r\n     respective Legislatures.\r\n\r\n     THE REV. FLORENCE KILLOCK (Ills.): ... Called as I am into the\r\n     homes of the people through the requirements of my office, I know\r\n     whereof I speak when I say that I am as faithfully fulfilling its\r\n     sacred duties when I come before you urging this claim, as when,\r\n     on my bended knees, I plead at the throne of God for the\r\n     salvation of souls.\r\n\r\n     I know too well the suffering that might be alleviated, the\r\n     terrible wrongs that might be righted, the sins that might be\r\n     punished, could the moral power of the women of our land be\r\n     utilized--could it be brought to bear on those great questions\r\n     which affect so vitally the welfare of society. The gigantic evil\r\n     of intemperance is prostrating the finest powers of our country\r\n     and threatening the life of social purity; it is in truth the\r\n     fell destroyer of peace, virtue and domestic and national safety,\r\n     and upon the unoffending the blow falls with the greatest weight.\r\n     Why should not they who suffer the most deeply through this evil,\r\n     be authorized before the law of the land to protect themselves\r\n     and their loved ones from its fearful ravages? Is it other than\r\n     simple justice which I ask for them? I have listened to too many\r\n     sad stories from heart-broken wives and mothers not to know that\r\n     the demand which the women of the land make in this matter comes\r\n     not from love of power, is not prompted by false ambition,\r\n     springs not from unwomanly aspirations, but does come from a\r\n     direful need of self-protection and an earnest desire to protect\r\n     those dearer than life itself.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen of the Judiciary Committee, in the same spirit in which\r\n     I seek the aid of Heaven in my endeavor to promote the spiritual\r\n     welfare of mankind, I now and here seek your aid in promoting the\r\n     highest moral welfare of every man, woman and child. This you\r\n     will do in giving your vote and influence for the equality of\r\n     women before the law, and as you thus confer this new power upon\r\n     the women of our land, like the bread cast upon the waters, it\r\n     shall come to you in a higher, nobler type of womanhood, in\r\n     sweeter homes, in purer social life, in all that contributes to\r\n     the welfare of the individual and the state.\r\n\r\n     MRS. MARY B. CLAY (Ky.): We do not come here to plead as\r\n     individual women with individual men, but as a subject class with\r\n     a ruling class; nor do we come as suffering individuals--though\r\n     God knows some of us might do that with propriety--but as the\r\n     suffering millions whom we represent....\r\n\r\n     We are born of the same parents as men and raised in the same\r\n     family. We are possessed of the same loves and animosities as our\r\n     brothers, and we inherit equally with them the substance of our\r\n     fathers. So long as we are minors the Government treats us as\r\n     equals, but when we come of age, when we are capable of feeling\r\n     and knowing the difference, the boy becomes a free human being,\r\n     while the girl remains a slave, a subject, and no moral heroism,\r\n     no self-sacrificing patriotism, ever entitles her to her freedom.\r\n     Is this just? Is it not, indeed, barbarous?\r\n\r\n     If American men intend always to keep women slaves, political and\r\n     civil, they make a great mistake when they let the girl, with the\r\n     boy, learn the alphabet, for no educated class will long remain\r\n     in subjection. We are told that men protect us; that they are\r\n     generous, even chivalric in their protection. Gentlemen, if your\r\n     protectors were women, and they took all your property and your\r\n     children, and paid you half as much for your work, though as well\r\n     or better done than your own, would you think much of the\r\n     chivalry which permitted you to sit in street-cars and picked up\r\n     your pocket-handkerchief?\r\n\r\n     Each one of you is responsible for these laws continuing as they\r\n     are, and you can not avoid responsibility by saying that you did\r\n     not help to make them. Great injustice is done us in the fact\r\n     that we are not tried by a jury of our peers. Great injustice is\r\n     done us everywhere by our not having a vote. Human nature is\r\n     naturally selfish, and, as woman is deprived of the ballot, and\r\n     powerless either to punish or reward, man, loving his bread and\r\n     butter more than justice, will ever thrust her aside for the\r\n     benefit of those who can help him, those with ballots in their\r\n     hands.\r\n\r\n     ....All that is good in the home, and largely the highest\r\n     principles taught in your youth, were given by your mothers. How\r\n     then it is possible for you to return this love and interest, as\r\n     soon as you are capable of acting, by riveting the chains which\r\n     hold them still slaves, politically and civilly?\r\n\r\n     You need woman's presence and counsel in legislation as much as\r\n     she needs yours in the home; you need the association and\r\n     influence of woman; her intuitive knowledge of men's character\r\n     and the effect of measures upon the household; you need her for\r\n     the economical details of public work; you need her sense of\r\n     justice and moral courage to execute the laws; you need her for\r\n     all that is just, merciful and good in government. But above all,\r\n     women themselves need the ballot for self-protection, and as we\r\n     are by common right and the laws of God free human beings, we\r\n     demand that you no longer hold us your subjects--your political\r\n     slaves.\r\n\r\n     MRS. MARY E. HAGGART (Ind.): When Abraham Lincoln penned the\r\n     immortal emancipation proclamation he did not stop to inquire\r\n     whether every man and every woman in Southern slavery did or did\r\n     not want to be free. Whether women do or do not wish to vote does\r\n     not affect the question of their right to do so. The right of man\r\n     to the ballot is a logical deduction from the principles\r\n     enunciated in the Declaration of Independence. And singular to\r\n     say, while this inheres in all people alike, the privilege of\r\n     exercising it is withheld from women by a class who have no right\r\n     to say whether they are willing or not that women should vote.\r\n     Their right to the ballot was long ago settled beyond a quibble,\r\n     by laws and principles of justice which are superior to the codes\r\n     of men, who have usurped the power to regulate the voting\r\n     privileges of citizens. If this right be inherent and existing in\r\n     the great body of society before governments are formed, it\r\n     follows that all citizens of a republic, be they male or female,\r\n     are alike entitled to its exercise.\r\n\r\n     ....Is there a man among you willing to resign his own right to\r\n     the ballot and to place his own business interests and general\r\n     welfare at the mercy of the votes of others? Would you not resent\r\n     an attempt on the part of any man, or set of men, to fix your\r\n     mental status, assign your work in life and lay out with\r\n     mathematical precision your exact sphere in the world? And yet\r\n     men undertake to adjust the limitations of the Elizabeth Cady\r\n     Stantons, the Susan B. Anthonys, the Harriet Beecher Stowes, the\r\n     Frances E. Willards, the Harriet Hosmers of the world, and\r\n     continue to talk with patronizing condescension of female\r\n     retirement, female duties and female spheres.\r\n\r\n     The question is not whether women want or do not want to vote,\r\n     but how can republican inconsistencies be wiped out, justice\r\n     universally recognized and impartially administered, and the\r\n     civil and political errors of the past effectually repaired.\r\n     Whoever admits that men have a right to the franchise must\r\n     include in the admission women also, for there are no reasons\r\n     capable of demonstrating an abstract right in behalf of one sex\r\n     which are not equally applicable to the other....\r\n\r\n     The assertion that women do not want to vote is absolutely\r\n     without authority, so long as each individual woman does not\r\n     speak out for herself. In Ohio 225,000, and in Illinois 185,000,\r\n     have signified a desire to use the ballot for home protection,\r\n     and yet it is still asserted in those States that women do not\r\n     want it. Over 100,000 women have already notified this Congress\r\n     that they desire equality of political rights, and still it is\r\n     declared all around us that women do not want to vote. Gentlemen,\r\n     this is most emphatically an assertion which no individual can be\r\n     justified in making for another.\r\n\r\n     Since the elective franchise is the parent stem from which branch\r\n     out legal, industrial, social and educational enterprises\r\n     necessary to the welfare of the citizens, it will be readily seen\r\n     how women engaged in reforms, public charities, social\r\n     enterprises, are hampered and trammeled in their progress without\r\n     the ballot. Women have beheld their plans frustrated, their\r\n     Herculean labor undone, their lives wasted, for want of\r\n     legislative power through the citizen's emblem of sovereignty....\r\n\r\n     All ranks and occupations are beginning to realize that monstrous\r\n     evils must ever crowd upon both classes while one side of\r\n     humanity only is represented, and while one sex has the\r\n     irresponsible keeping of the rights and privileges of the other.\r\n     To-day, throughout the length and breadth of our land, woman\r\n     finds the greatest need of the ballot through an almost\r\n     overpowering desire to have her wishes and opinions crystallized\r\n     into law.\r\n\r\n     I have no hesitancy in saying that if the conditions which\r\n     surround the women of this nation to-day were the conditions of\r\n     the male citizens of the country, they would rise up and\r\n     pronounce them the exact definition of civil and political\r\n     slavery, instead of the true interpretation of natural justice\r\n     and civil equity.\r\n\r\n     Many persons claim that men are born with the right to vote, as\r\n     they are to the right of life, liberty and happiness; that\r\n     suffrage is the gift of the State, and that the State has a right\r\n     to regulate it in any way that it may deem best for the common\r\n     good. If men are born with the right to life, liberty and\r\n     happiness, they are also born with the right to give expression\r\n     as to how these are to be maintained; and in this nation, which\r\n     professes to rest upon the consent of the governed, this\r\n     expression is given through the ballot. Consequently the\r\n     expression of a freeman's will is as God-given as his right to be\r\n     free. Since the year of Magna Charta we have repudiated the idea\r\n     of representation by proxy.\r\n\r\n     We all know that there are thousands of women in this nation who\r\n     are owners of property, mothers of children, devoted to their\r\n     homes and families and to all the duties and responsibilities\r\n     which grow out of social life, and hence are most deeply\r\n     interested in the public welfare. They have just as much at\r\n     stake in this Government, which affords them no opportunity of\r\n     giving or withholding their consent, as men who are consulted.\r\n     John Quincy Adams said in that grand speech in defense of the\r\n     petitions of the women of Plymouth: \"The women are not only\r\n     justified, but exhibit the most exalted virtue, when they do\r\n     depart from the domestic sphere and enter upon the concerns of\r\n     their country, of humanity and of God.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Phoebe W. Couzins (Mo.) in closing her address said: \"At the\r\ngateway of this nation, the harbor of New York, there soon shall stand\r\na statue of the Goddess of Liberty, presented by the republic of\r\nFrance--a magnificent figure of a woman, typifying all that is grand\r\nand glorious and free in self-government. She will hold aloft an\r\nelectric torch of great power which is to beam an effulgent light far\r\nout to sea, that ships sailing towards this goodly land may ride\r\nsafely into harbor. So should you thus uplift the women of this\r\nnation, and teach these men, at the very threshold, when first their\r\nfeet shall touch the shore of this republic, that here woman is\r\nexalted, ennobled and honored; that here she bears aloft the torch of\r\nintelligence and purity which guides our Ship of State into the safe\r\nharbor of wise laws, pure morals and secure institutions.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been the custom of these committees, when they reported at all,\r\nto delay doing so until the following year. In 1884, however, those of\r\nboth Senate and House submitted reports soon after the hearings. The\r\nfavorable recommendation was presented March 28, 1884, signed by\r\nThomas W. Palmer, Henry W. Blair, Elbridge G. Lapham and Henry B.\r\nAnthony. Senators Francis Marion Cockrell and Joseph E. Brown\r\ndissented.[24] The name of Senator James G. Fair does not appear on\r\neither document, but he had signed an adverse report in 1882.\r\n\r\nAn adverse majority report from the House Judiciary Committee was\r\npresented by William C. Maybury (Mich.) and began thus:\r\n\r\n     The right of suffrage is not and never has, under our system of\r\n     government, been one of the essential rights of citizenship....\r\n\r\n     What class or portion of the whole people of any State should be\r\n     admitted to suffrage, and should, by virtue of such admission,\r\n     exert the active and potential control in the direction of its\r\n     affairs, was a question reserved exclusively for the\r\n     determination of the State.\r\n\r\n[The report loses sight entirely of the point that this question was\r\nnot and never has been left to \"the people\" of a State, but that men\r\nalone usurped the right to decide who should be admitted to the\r\nsuffrage, arbitrarily excluded women and have kept them excluded.]\r\n\r\n     Under the influence of a just fear that without suffrage as a\r\n     protective power to the newly-acquired rights and privileges\r\n     guaranteed to the former slave he might suffer detriment, and\r\n     with this dominant motive in view, originated the Fifteenth\r\n     Amendment. It will be noted that by this later amendment the\r\n     privilege of suffrage is not sought to be _conferred_ on any\r\n     class; but an inhibition is placed upon the States from\r\n     _excluding_ from the privilege of suffrage any class on account\r\n     of race, color or previous condition of servitude.\r\n\r\n[The Fifteenth Amendment does not mention the \"privilege\" of suffrage.\r\nIt says expressly, \"The _right_ of citizens of the United States to\r\nvote shall not be denied or abridged.\" But whether it be a \"right\" or\r\na \"privilege,\" where did the negro get that which the States are\r\nforbidden to deny or abridge, if it does not inhere in citizenship?\r\nThe report is incorrect in saying that the State is prohibited from\r\nexcluding any \"class;\" it is only the \"males\" of any class who are\r\nprotected from exclusion. The same right or privilege belongs to\r\nwomen, but they are not protected in the exercise of it. Women never\r\nhave asked Congress to grant them any _new_ right or privilege, but\r\nonly to prohibit the States from denying or abridging what is already\r\ntheirs, as it did in the case of negro men.]\r\n\r\n     Woman's true sphere is not restricted, but is boundless in\r\n     resources and consequences. In it she may employ every energy of\r\n     the mind and every affection of the heart, while within its\r\n     limitless compass, under Providence, she exercises a power and\r\n     influence beyond all other agencies for good. She trains and\r\n     guides the life that is, and forms it for the eternity and\r\n     immortality that are to be. From the rude contact of life, man is\r\n     her shield. He is her guardian from its conflicts. He is the\r\n     defender of her rights in his home, and the avenger of her wrongs\r\n     everywhere.\r\n\r\n[That is, what man considers her true sphere is not restricted, but\r\nshe is not allowed to decide for herself what shall be its\r\ndimensions. \"Her power for good is beyond all other agencies,\" but it\r\nis not wanted in affairs of State, where surely it is needed quite as\r\nbadly as in any place in the world. \"Man is her shield, guardian,\r\ndefender and avenger.\" Witness the Common Law of England, made by men,\r\nunder which women lived for centuries and which is still in force in a\r\nnumber of the States; witness the records of the courts with the\r\nwife-beaters and slayers, the rapists, the seducers, the husbands who\r\nhave deserted their families, the schemers who have defrauded widows\r\nand orphans--witness all these and then say if all men are the natural\r\nprotectors of women. But even if they were, witness the millions of\r\nwomen who are not legally entitled to the protection and assistance of\r\nany man. However, the report does not forget these women.]\r\n\r\n     The exceptional cases of unmarried females are too rare to change\r\n     the general policy, while expectancy and hope, constantly being\r\n     realized in marriage, are happily extinguishing the exceptions\r\n     and bringing all within the rule which governs wife and matron.\r\n\r\n     To permit the entrance of political contention into the home\r\n     would be either useless or pernicious--useless if man and wife\r\n     agree, and pernicious if they differ. In the former event the\r\n     volume of ballots alone would be increased without changing\r\n     results. In the latter, the peace and contentment of home would\r\n     be exchanged for the bedlam of political debate and become the\r\n     scene of base and demoralizing intrigue.\r\n\r\n[What a breadth of statesmanship, what a grasp of the principles of a\r\nrepublican form of government, to see in the voting of husband and\r\nwife only an \"increase of ballots\"; what a reflection upon men to\r\nassume that if there were an honest difference of opinion \"the home\r\nwould become a scene of base and demoralizing intrigue\"; what a\r\nrecognition of justice to decree that, since possibly there might be a\r\ndisagreement, the man should do the voting and the woman should be\r\nforbidden a voice!]\r\n\r\n     In respect to married women, it may well be doubted whether the\r\n     influences which result from the laws of property between husband\r\n     and wife, would not make it improbable that the woman should\r\n     exercise her suffrage with freedom and independence. This, too,\r\n     in despite of the fact that the dependence of woman under the\r\n     Common Law has been almost entirely obliterated by statutory\r\n     enactments.\r\n\r\n[Almost, but not quite, and it would still prevail everywhere had its\r\nobliteration depended upon the committee making this report. Think of\r\nsaying in cold blood that, as the husband holds the purse-strings, the\r\nwife would not dare vote with freedom and independence!]\r\n\r\n     Your committee are of the opinion that while a few intelligent\r\n     women, such as appeared before the committee in advocacy of the\r\n     pending measure, would defy all obstacles in the way of their\r\n     casting the ballot, yet the great mass of the intelligent,\r\n     refined and judicious, with the becoming modesty of their sex,\r\n     would shrink from the rude contact of the crowd and, with the\r\n     exceptions mentioned, leave the ignorant and vile the exclusive\r\n     right to speak for the gentler sex in public affairs.\r\n\r\n[This opinion has been wholly disproved by the experience of States\r\nwhere women do vote. The \"intelligent and judicious\" have learned that\r\nthere is more \"rude contact\" in going to the market, the theater, the\r\ntrain and the ferry-boat, than in a quiet booth where no man is\r\npermitted to come within a hundred feet. But women are not so \"modest\r\nand refined\" as to shrink from \"rude contact\" even, if it would give\r\nthem the opportunity to control the conditions which surround and\r\ninfluence their husbands, their children, their homes and their\r\ncommunity.]\r\n\r\n     Your committee are of the opinion that the general policy of\r\n     female suffrage should remain in abeyance, in so far as the\r\n     general Government is concerned, until the States and communities\r\n     directly chargeable under our system of government with the\r\n     exercise and regulation of this privilege, shall put the seal of\r\n     affirmation upon it; and there certainly can be no reason for an\r\n     amendment of the Constitution to settle a question within the\r\n     jurisdiction of the States, and which they should first settle\r\n     for themselves.\r\n\r\n[Of course, according to this logic, after the States settle the\r\nquestion and put the seal of affirmation on it, then the general\r\nGovernment will take a hand!]\r\n\r\nThis House Report (No. 1330) was not drastic enough to suit the Hon.\r\nLuke P. Poland (Vt.), so he made his own, in which he said:\r\n\r\n     No government founded upon the principle that sovereignty resides\r\n     in the people has ever allowed all the people to vote, or to\r\n     directly participate in making or administering the laws.\r\n     Suffrage has never been regarded as the natural right of all the\r\n     people or of any particular class or portion of the people.\r\n     Suffrage is representation, and it has been given in free\r\n     governments to such class of persons as in their judgment [whose\r\n     judgment?] would fairly and safely represent the rights and\r\n     interests of the whole. The right has generally, if not\r\n     universally, been conferred on men above twenty-one years of age,\r\n     and often this has been restricted by requiring the ownership of\r\n     property or the payment of taxes. [Which?]\r\n\r\n     The great majority of women are either under the age of\r\n     twenty-one, or are married and therefore _under such influence\r\n     and control_ as that relation implies and confers. Is there any\r\n     necessity for the protection and preservation of the rights of\r\n     women, that they must be allowed to vote and, of course, to hold\r\n     office and directly to participate in the administration of the\r\n     laws?\r\n\r\n     Nearly every man who votes has a wife or mother or sisters or\r\n     daughters; some sustain all these relations or more than one. I\r\n     think it certain that the great majority of men when voting or\r\n     when engaged as legislators or in administering the laws in some\r\n     official character, are fully mindful of the interests of all\r\n     that class with whom they are so closely connected, and whose\r\n     interests are so bound up with their own, and that, therefore,\r\n     they fairly represent all the rights and interests of women as\r\n     well as their own. Persons who have been accustomed to see legal\r\n     proceedings in the courts, and occasionally to see a female\r\n     litigant in court, know very well whether they are apt to suffer\r\n     wrong because their rights are determined wholly by men.[25]\r\n     There is just as little reason for suspicion that their rights\r\n     are not carefully guarded in legislation, and in every way where\r\n     legislation can operate.\r\n\r\n     There is another reason why I think this proposal to enlist the\r\n     women of the country as a part of its active political force, and\r\n     to cast upon them an equal duty in the political meetings,\r\n     campaigns and elections--to make them legislators, jurors, judges\r\n     and executive officers--is all wrong. I believe it to be utterly\r\n     inconsistent with the very nature and constitution of woman, and\r\n     wholly subversive of the sphere and function she was designed to\r\n     fill in the home and in society. The office and duty which nature\r\n     has devolved upon woman during _all the active and vigorous\r\n     portion_ of her life would often render it impossible, and still\r\n     more often indelicate, for her to appear and act in caucuses,\r\n     conventions or elections, or to act as a member of the\r\n     Legislature or as a juror or judge.\r\n\r\n     I can not bring myself to believe that any large portion of the\r\n     intelligent women of this country desire any such thing granted\r\n     them, or would perform any such duties if the chance were offered\r\n     them.\r\n\r\n[To comment upon this would be \"to gild refined gold, to paint the\r\nlily, to throw a perfume on the violet.\" It would be positively\r\n\"indelicate.\"]\r\n\r\nWilliam Dorsheimer (N. Y.) agreed with the committee to table the\r\nresolution, but did not endorse their arguments. He signed the\r\nfollowing statement: \"I think it probable that the interests of\r\nsociety will some time require that women should have the right of\r\nsuffrage, and I am not willing to say more than that the present is\r\nnot an opportune time for submission to the States of the proposed\r\namendment.\"\r\n\r\nIn this, it will be observed, there is no recognition of woman's right\r\nto represent herself, no disposition to grant her petition for her own\r\nsake, but simply the opinion that should there ever be a crisis when\r\nher suffrage was needed it should be allowed as a matter of\r\nexpediency.\r\n\r\nIn the eyes of posterity the Judiciary Committee of this Forty-eighth\r\nCongress will be redeemed from the disgrace of these reports by that\r\nof the minority, signed by Thomas B. Reed, afterwards for many years\r\nSpeaker of the House; Ezra B. Taylor (O.); Moses A. McCoid (Ia.);\r\nThomas M. Browne (Ind.). The question of woman suffrage never has been\r\nand never can be more concisely and logically stated.\r\n\r\n     No one who listens to the reasons given by the superior class for\r\n     the continuance of any system of subjection can fail to be\r\n     impressed with the noble disinterestedness of mankind. When the\r\n     subjection of persons of African descent was to be maintained,\r\n     the good of those persons was always the main object. When it was\r\n     the fashion to beat children, to regard them as little animals\r\n     who had no rights, it was always for their good that they were\r\n     treated with severity, and never on account of the bad temper of\r\n     their parents. Hence, when it is proposed to give to the women of\r\n     this country an opportunity to present their case to the various\r\n     State Legislatures to demand equality of political rights, it is\r\n     not surprising to find that the reasons on which the continuance\r\n     of the inferiority of women is urged are drawn almost entirely\r\n     from a tender consideration of their own good. The anxiety felt\r\n     lest they should thereby deteriorate would be an honor to human\r\n     nature were it not an historical fact that the same sweet\r\n     solicitude has been put up as a barrier against all the progress\r\n     which women have made since civilization began.\r\n\r\n     There is no doubt that if to-day in Turkey or Algiers, countries\r\n     where woman's sphere is most thoroughly confined to the home\r\n     circle, it was proposed to admit them to social life, to remove\r\n     the veil from their faces and permit them to converse in open day\r\n     with the friends of their husbands and brothers, the conservative\r\n     and judicious Turk or Algerine of the period, if he could be\r\n     brought even to consider such a horrible proposition, would point\r\n     out that the sphere of woman was to make home happy by those\r\n     gentle insipidities which education would destroy; that by\r\n     participating in conversation with men they would debase their\r\n     natures, and men would thereby lose that ameliorating influence\r\n     which still leaves them unfit to associate with women. He would\r\n     point out that \"nature\" had determined that women should be\r\n     secluded; that their sphere was to raise and educate the\r\n     man-child, and that any change would be a violation of the divine\r\n     law which, in the opinion of all conservative men, ordains the\r\n     present but never the future.\r\n\r\n     So in civilized countries when it was proposed that women should\r\n     own their own property, that they should have the earnings of\r\n     their own labor, there were not wanting those who were sure that\r\n     such a proposition could work only evil to women, and that\r\n     continually. It would destroy the family, discordant interests\r\n     would provoke dispute, and the only real safety for woman was in\r\n     the headship of man; not that man wanted superiority for any\r\n     selfish reason, but to preserve intact the family relation for\r\n     woman's good. To-day a woman's property belongs to herself; her\r\n     earnings are her own; she has been emancipated beyond the wildest\r\n     hopes of any reformer of twenty-five years ago. Almost every\r\n     vocation is open to her. She is proving her usefulness in spheres\r\n     which the \"nature\" worshiped by the conservative of the last\r\n     generation absolutely forbade her to enter. Notwithstanding all\r\n     these changes the family circle remains unbroken, the man-child\r\n     gets as well educated as before, and the ameliorating influence\r\n     of woman has become only the more marked.\r\n\r\n     Thirty years ago hardly any political assemblage of the people\r\n     was graced by the presence of women. Had it needed a law to\r\n     enable them to be present, what an argument could have been made\r\n     against it! How easily it could have been shown that the\r\n     coarseness, the dubious expressions, the general vulgarity of the\r\n     scene, could have had no other effect than to break down that\r\n     purity of thought and word which women have, and which\r\n     conservative and radical are alike sedulous to preserve. And yet\r\n     the actual presence of women at political meetings has not\r\n     debased them but has raised the other sex. Coarseness has not\r\n     become diffused through both sexes but has fled from both. To put\r\n     the whole matter in a short phrase: The association of the sexes\r\n     in the family circle, in society, and in business, having\r\n     improved both, there is neither history, reason nor sense to\r\n     justify the assertion that association in politics will lower the\r\n     one or demoralize the other.\r\n\r\n     Hence, we would do well to approach the question without\r\n     trepidation. We can better leave the \"sphere\" of woman to the\r\n     future than confine it in the chains of the past. Words change\r\n     nothing. Prejudices are none the less prejudices because we\r\n     vaguely call them \"nature,\" and prate about what nature has\r\n     forbidden, when we only mean that the thing we are opposing has\r\n     not been hitherto done. \"Nature\" forbade a steamship to cross the\r\n     Atlantic the very moment it was crossing, and yet it arrived just\r\n     the same. What the majority call \"nature\" has stood in the way of\r\n     all progress of the past and present, and will stand in the way\r\n     of all future progress. It is only another name for conservatism.\r\n     With conservatism the minority have no quarrel. It is essential\r\n     to the stability of mankind, of government and of social life.\r\n     To every new proposal it rightfully calls a halt, demanding\r\n     countersign, whether it be friend or foe. The enfranchisement of\r\n     women must pass this ordeal like everything else. It must give\r\n     good reason for its demand to be, or take its place among the\r\n     half-forgotten fantasies which have challenged the support of\r\n     mankind and have not stood the test of argument and discussion.\r\n\r\n     The majority of the committee claim that suffrage is not a right\r\n     but a privilege to be guarded by those who have it, and to be by\r\n     them doled out to those who shall become worthy. That every\r\n     extension of suffrage has been granted in some form or other by\r\n     those already holding it is probably true. In some countries,\r\n     however, it has been extended upon the simple basis of\r\n     expediency, and in others in obedience to a claim of right. If\r\n     suffrage be a right, if it be true that no man has a claim to\r\n     govern any other man except to the extent that the other man has\r\n     a right to govern him, then there can be no discussion of the\r\n     question of Woman Suffrage. No reason on earth can be given by\r\n     those who claim suffrage as a right of manhood which does not\r\n     make it a right of womanhood also. If the suffrage is to be given\r\n     man to protect him in his life, liberty and property, the same\r\n     reasons urge that it be given to woman, for she has the same\r\n     life, liberty and property to protect. If it be urged that her\r\n     interests are so bound up in those of man that they are sure to\r\n     be protected, the answer is that the same argument was urged as\r\n     to the merging in the husband of the wife's right of property,\r\n     and was pronounced by the judgment of mankind fallacious in\r\n     practice and in principle. If the natures of men and women are so\r\n     alike that for that reason no harm is done by suppressing women,\r\n     what harm can be done by elevating them to equality? If the\r\n     natures be different, what right can there be in refusing\r\n     representation to those who might take juster views about many\r\n     social and political questions?\r\n\r\n     Our Government is founded, not on the rule of the wisest and\r\n     best, but upon the rule of all. The learned and the ignorant, the\r\n     wise and the unwise, the judicious and the injudicious are all\r\n     invited to assist in governing, and upon the broad principle that\r\n     the best government for mankind is not the government which the\r\n     wisest and best would select, but that which the average of\r\n     mankind would select. Laws are daily enacted, not because they\r\n     seem the wisest even to those legislators who pass them, but\r\n     because they represent what the whole people wish. And, in the\r\n     long run, it may be just as bad to enact laws in advance of\r\n     public sentiment as to hold on to laws behind it. Upon what\r\n     principle in a Government like ours can one-half the minds be\r\n     denied expression at the polls? Is it because they are untrained\r\n     in public affairs? Are they more so than the slaves were when the\r\n     right of suffrage was conferred on them? It is objected that to\r\n     admit women would be temporarily to lower the suffrage on account\r\n     of their lack of training in public duties. What is now asked of\r\n     us is not immediate admission to the right, but the privilege of\r\n     presenting to the Legislatures of the different States the\r\n     amendment, which can not become effective until adopted by\r\n     three-fourths of them. It may be said that the agitation and\r\n     discussion of this question will, long before its adoption, have\r\n     made women as familiar with public affairs as the average of men,\r\n     for the agitation is hardly likely to be successful until after a\r\n     majority, at least, of women are in favor of it.\r\n\r\n     We believe in the educating and improving effect of participation\r\n     in government. We believe that every citizen in the United States\r\n     is made more intelligent, more learned and better educated by his\r\n     participation in politics and political campaigns. It must be\r\n     remembered that education, like all things else, is relative.\r\n     While the average American voter may not be all that impatient\r\n     people desire, and is far behind his own future, yet he is\r\n     incomparably superior to the average citizen of any other land\r\n     where the subject does not fully participate in the government.\r\n     Discussions on the stump, and above all the discussions he\r\n     himself has with his fellows, breed a desire for knowledge which\r\n     will take no refusal and which leads to great general\r\n     intelligence. In political discussion, acrimony and hate are not\r\n     essential, and have of late years quite perceptibly diminished\r\n     and will more and more diminish when discussions by women, and in\r\n     the presence of women, become more common. If, then, discussion\r\n     of public affairs among men has elevated them in knowledge and\r\n     intelligence, why will it not lead to the same results among\r\n     women? It is not merely education that makes civilization, but\r\n     diffusion of education. The standing of a nation and its future\r\n     depend not upon the education of the few, but of the whole. Every\r\n     improvement in the status of woman in the matter of education has\r\n     been an improvement to the whole race. Women have by education\r\n     thus far become more womanly, not less. The same prophecies of\r\n     ruin to womanliness were made against her education on general\r\n     subjects that are now made against her participation in politics.\r\n\r\n     It is sometimes asserted that women now have a great influence in\r\n     politics through their husbands and brothers. This is undoubtedly\r\n     true. But that is just the kind of influence which is not\r\n     wholesome for the community, for it is influence unaccompanied by\r\n     responsibility. People are always ready to recommend to others\r\n     what they would not do themselves. If it be true that women can\r\n     not be prevented from exercising political influence, is not that\r\n     only another reason why they should be steadied in their\r\n     political action by that proper sense of responsibility which\r\n     comes from acting themselves?\r\n\r\n     We conclude then, that every reason which in this country bestows\r\n     the ballot upon man is equally applicable to the proposition to\r\n     bestow the ballot upon woman, and that in our judgment there is\r\n     no foundation for the fear that woman will thereby become\r\n     unfitted for all the duties she has hitherto performed.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[20] For an interesting account of the struggle to secure these\r\ncommittees see History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. III, p. 198.\r\n\r\n[21] But it was after five years of persistent appeal to Congress by\r\nMrs. Belva A.

C., Jan. 20-22, 1885, preceded by the usual brilliant\r\nreception, which was extended by Mr. and Mrs. Spofford each season for\r\nthe twelve years during which the association had its headquarters at\r\nthe Riggs House.\r\n\r\nIt is rather amusing to note the custom of the newspaper reporters to\r\ngive a detailed description of the dress of each one of the speakers,\r\nusually to the exclusion of the subject-matter of her speech. On this\r\noccasion the public was informed that one lady \"spoke in dark bangs\r\nand Bismarck brown;\" one \"in black and gold with angel sleeves,\r\nboutonnière and ear-drops;\" another \"in a basque polonaise and snake\r\nbracelets;\" another \"in black silk dress and bonnet, gold eye-glasses\r\nand black kid gloves.\" One lady wore \"a small bonnet made of\r\ngaudy-colored birds' wings;\" one \"spoke with a pretty lisp, was\r\nattired in a box-pleated satin skirt, velvet newmarket basque\r\npolonaise, hollyhock corsage bouquet;\" another \"addressed the meeting\r\nin low tones and a poke bonnet;\" still another \"discussed the question\r\nin a velvet bonnet and plain linen collar.\" \"A large lady wore a green\r\ncashmere dress with pink ribbons in her hair;\" then there was \"a slim\r\nlady with tulle ruffles, velvet sacque and silk skirt.\" Of one it was\r\nsaid: \"Her face, though real feminine in shape, was painted all over\r\nwith business till it looked like a man's, and her hair was shingled\r\nand brushed in little banglets.\" \"Miss Anthony,\" so the report said,\r\n\"wore a blue barbe trimmed in lace,\" while Mrs. Stanton \"was attired\r\nin a black silk dress with a white handkerchief around her throat.\"\r\nOne record declares that \"there was not a pair of earrings on the\r\nplatform, but most of the ladies wore gold watch-chains.\"\r\n\r\nThese extracts are taken verbatim from the best newspapers of the\r\nday. The conventions had passed the stage where, according to the\r\nreporters, all of the participants had short hair and wore bloomers,\r\nbut, according to the same authority, they had reached the wonderful\r\nattire described above. This was fifteen years ago. The proceedings of\r\nthe national convention of 1900 occupied from four to seven columns\r\ndaily in each of the Washington papers, and one or more columns were\r\ntelegraphed each day to the large newspapers of the United States, and\r\nyet it may be safely said that there was not one line of reference to\r\nthe costumes of the ladies in attendance. The business meetings,\r\nspeeches, etc., were reported with the same respect and dignity as are\r\naccorded to national conventions of men. The petty personalities of\r\nthe past were wholly eliminated and women were presented from an\r\nintellectual standpoint, to be judged upon their merits and not by\r\ntheir clothes. This result alone is worth the fifty years of endeavor.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton presided over all of the sessions. Mrs.\r\nLillie Devereux Blake gave a full report of the legislative work done\r\nin New York during the past year. In the address of Mrs. Harriette R.\r\nShattuck (Mass.) she laid especial stress on the need for women to be\r\ninvested with responsibility. Mrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage (N. Y.)\r\ndiscussed the woman question from a scientific standpoint. She was\r\nfollowed by Mrs. Laura de Force Gordon, the second woman admitted to\r\npractice before the U. S. Supreme Court, who answered the question, Is\r\nour Civilization Civilized? and described the legal status of women in\r\nCalifornia. Mrs. Caroline Gilkey Rogers (N. Y.) gave a spirited talk\r\non the Aristocracy of Sex. The principal address of the evening was by\r\nMrs. Stanton, a long and thoughtful paper in which she said:\r\n\r\n     Those people who declaim on the inequalities of sex, the\r\n     disabilities and limitations of one as against the other, show\r\n     themselves as ignorant of the first principles of life as would\r\n     that philosopher who should undertake to show the comparative\r\n     power of the positive as against the negative electricity, of the\r\n     centrifugal as against the centripetal force, the attraction of\r\n     the north as against the south end of the magnet. These great\r\n     natural forces must be perfectly balanced or the whole material\r\n     world would relapse into chaos. Just so the masculine and\r\n     feminine elements in humanity must be exactly balanced to redeem\r\n     the moral and social world from the chaos which surrounds it.\r\n     One might as well talk of separate spheres for the two ends of\r\n     the magnet as for man and woman; they may have separate duties in\r\n     the same sphere, but their true place is together everywhere.\r\n     Having different duties in the same sphere, neither can succeed\r\n     without the presence and influence of the other. To restore the\r\n     equilibrium of sex is the first step in social, religious and\r\n     political progress. It is by the constant repression of the best\r\n     elements in humanity, by our false customs, creeds and codes,\r\n     that we have thus far retarded civilization....\r\n\r\n     There would be more sense in insisting on man's limitations\r\n     because he can not be a mother, than on woman's because she can\r\n     be. Surely maternity is an added power and development of some of\r\n     the most tender sentiments of the human heart and not a\r\n     \"limitation.\" \"Yes,\" says another pertinacious reasoner, \"but it\r\n     unfits woman for much of the world's work.\" Yes, and it fits her\r\n     for much of the world's work; a large share of human legislation\r\n     would be better done by her because of this deep experience....\r\n\r\n     If one-half the effort had been expended to exalt the feminine\r\n     element that has been made to degrade it, we should have reached\r\n     the natural equilibrium long ago. Either sex, in isolation, is\r\n     robbed of one-half its power for the accomplishment of any given\r\n     work. This was the most fatal dogma of the Christian\r\n     religion--that in proportion as men withdrew from all\r\n     companionship with women, they could get nearer to God, grow more\r\n     like the Divine Ideal.\r\n\r\nTelegrams of greetings were received from many associations and\r\nindividuals. Miss Frances Ellen Burr, who made a fine stenographic\r\nreport of the entire convention, spoke for Connecticut, closing with\r\nan ideal picture of civilization as it might be with the wisdom of\r\nboth sexes brought to bear on the problems of society. The following\r\nresolutions were written by Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The dogmas incorporated in the religious creeds derived\r\n     from Judaism, teaching that woman was an afterthought in\r\n     creation, her sex a misfortune, marriage a condition of\r\n     subordination, and maternity a curse, are contrary to the law of\r\n     God as revealed in nature and the precepts of Christ; and,\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, These dogmas are an insidious poison, sapping the\r\n     vitality of our civilization, blighting woman and palsying\r\n     humanity; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we denounce these dogmas wherever they are\r\n     enunciated, and we will withdraw our personal support from any\r\n     organization so holding and teaching; and,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we call upon the Christian ministry, as leaders\r\n     of thought, to teach and enforce the fundamental idea of creation\r\n     that man was made in the image of God, male and female, and given\r\n     equal dominion over the earth, but none over each other. And\r\n     further we invite their co-operation in securing the recognition\r\n     of the cardinal point of our creed, that in true religion there\r\n     is neither male nor female, neither bond nor free, but all are\r\n     one.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions were introduced and advocated by Mrs. Stanton, who\r\nsaid: \"Woman has been licensed to preach in the Methodist church; the\r\nUnitarian and Universalist and some branches of the Baptist\r\ndenomination have ordained women, but the majority do not recognize\r\nthem officially, although for the first three centuries after the\r\nproclamation of Christianity women had a place in the church. They\r\nwere deaconesses and elders, and were ordained and administered the\r\nsacrament. Yet through the Catholic hierarchy these privileges were\r\ntaken away in Christendom and they have never been restored. Now we\r\nintend to demand equal rights in the church.\"\r\n\r\nThis precipitated a vigorous discussion which extended into the next\r\nday. Miss Anthony was opposed to a consideration of the resolutions\r\nand in giving her reasons said:\r\n\r\n     I was on the old Garrisonian platform and found long ago that\r\n     this matter of settling any question of human rights by people's\r\n     interpretation of the Bible is never satisfactory. I hope we\r\n     shall not go back to that war. No two can ever interpret alike,\r\n     and discussion upon it is time wasted. We all know what we want,\r\n     and that is the recognition of woman's perfect equality--in the\r\n     Home, the Church and the State. We all know that such recognition\r\n     has never been granted her in the centuries of the past. But for\r\n     us to begin a discussion here as to who established these dogmas\r\n     would be anything but profitable. Let those who wish go back into\r\n     the history of the past, but I beg it shall not be done on our\r\n     platform.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary E. McPherson (Ia.) insisted that the Bible did not ignore\r\nwomen, although custom might do so. The Rev. Dr. McMurdy (D. C.)\r\ndeclared that women were teachers under the old Jewish dispensation;\r\nthat the Catholic church set apart its women, ordained them and gave\r\nthem the title \"reverend\"; that the Episcopal church ordained\r\ndeaconesses. He hoped the convention would not take action on this\r\nquestion. John B. Wolf upheld the resolution. Mrs. Shattuck thought\r\nthe church was coming around to a belief in woman suffrage and it\r\nwould be a mistake to antagonize it.\r\n\r\nMrs. Colby insisted the resolutions did not attack the Bible, but the\r\ndogmas which grew out of man's interpretation of it, saying:\r\n\r\n     This dogma of woman's divinely appointed inferiority has sapped\r\n     the vitality of our civilization, blighted woman and palsied\r\n     humanity. As a Christian woman and a member of an orthodox\r\n     church, I stand on this resolution; on the divine plan of\r\n     creation as set forth in the first chapter of Genesis, where we\r\n     are told that man was created male and female and set over the\r\n     world to have equal dominion; and on the gospel of the new\r\n     dispensation, in which there is neither male nor female, bond nor\r\n     free, but all are one. This resolution avows our loyalty to what\r\n     we believe to be the true teachings of the Bible, and the\r\n     co-operation of the Christian ministry is invited in striving to\r\n     secure the application of the golden rule to women.\r\n\r\nEdward M. Davis (Penn.) declared that, while individual members might\r\nfavor woman suffrage, not one religious body ever had declared for it,\r\nand the convention ought to express itself on this subject. Mrs.\r\nGordon pointed out the difference between religion and theology. Mrs.\r\nStanton, being called on for further remarks, spoke in the most\r\nearnest manner:\r\n\r\n     You may go over the world and you will find that every form of\r\n     religion which has breathed upon this earth has degraded woman.\r\n     There is not one which has not made her subject to man. Men may\r\n     rejoice in them because they make man the head of the woman. I\r\n     have been traveling over the old world during the last few years\r\n     and have found new food for thought. What power is it that makes\r\n     the Hindoo woman burn herself on the funeral pyre of her husband?\r\n     Her religion. What holds the Turkish woman in the harem? Her\r\n     religion. By what power do the Mormons perpetuate their system of\r\n     polygamy? By their religion. Man, of himself, could not do this;\r\n     but when he declares, \"Thus saith the Lord,\" of course he can do\r\n     it. So long as ministers stand up and tell us that as Christ is\r\n     the head of the church, so is man the head of the woman, how are\r\n     we to break the chains which have held women down through the\r\n     ages? You Christian women can look at the Hindoo, the Turkish,\r\n     the Mormon women, and wonder how they can be held in such\r\n     bondage. Observe to-day the work women are doing for the\r\n     churches. _The church rests on the shoulders of women._ Have we\r\n     ever yet heard a man preach a sermon from Genesis i:27-28, which\r\n     declares the full equality of the feminine and masculine element\r\n     in the Godhead? They invariably shy at that first chapter. They\r\n     always get up in their pulpits and read the second chapter.\r\n\r\n     Now I ask you if our religion teaches the dignity of woman? It\r\n     teaches us that abominable idea of the sixth century--Augustine's\r\n     idea--that motherhood is a curse; that woman is the author of\r\n     sin, and is most corrupt. Can we ever cultivate any proper sense\r\n     of self-respect as long as women take such sentiments from the\r\n     mouths of the priesthood?... The canon laws are infamous--so\r\n     infamous that a council of the Christian church was swamped by\r\n     them. In republican America, and in the light of the nineteenth\r\n     century, we must demand that our religion shall teach a higher\r\n     idea in regard to woman. People seem to think we have reached the\r\n     very end of theology; but let me say that the future is to be as\r\n     much purer than the past as our immediate past has been better\r\n     than the dark ages. We want to help roll off from the soul of\r\n     woman the terrible superstitions that have so long repressed and\r\n     crushed her.\r\n\r\nThrough the determined efforts of Miss Anthony and some others the\r\nresolution was permitted to lie on the table.\r\n\r\nMiss Matilda Hindman (Penn.) gave an address on As the Rulers, So the\r\nPeople, well fortified with statistics. The Rev. Olympia Brown (Wis.)\r\nmade a stirring appeal under the title All Are Created Equal. Among\r\nthe many excellent addresses were those of Mrs. Colby, Mrs. Annie L.\r\nDiggs (Kas.) and Dr. Alice B. Stockham (Ills.). The usual resolutions\r\nwere adopted, and the memorial called forth a number of eulogies:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in the death of the Hon. Henry Fawcett, of\r\n     England, Senator Henry B. Anthony, the Rev. William Henry\r\n     Channing, ex-Secretary of the Treasury Charles J. Folger, Bishop\r\n     Matthew Simpson, Madame Mathilde Anneke, Kate Newell Doggett,\r\n     Frances Dana Gage, Laura Giddings Julian, Sarah Pugh and\r\n     Elizabeth T. Schenck, the year 1884 has been one of irreparable\r\n     losses to our movement.\r\n\r\nAmong the many interesting letters written to the convention was one\r\nfrom Wm. Lloyd Garrison, inclosing letters received in times past\r\nexpressing sympathy with the efforts of the suffrage advocates, from\r\nhis father, from Ralph Waldo Emerson and from the Rev. William Henry\r\nChanning, whose body at this very time was being borne across the\r\nocean to its resting place in this country. A touching message was\r\nread from that faithful and efficient pioneer, Clarina I. H. Nichols,\r\nof California, which ended: \"My last words in the good work for\r\nhumanity are, 'God is with us.' There can be no failure and no defeat\r\noutside ourselves.\" The writer passed away before it reached the\r\nconvention. Other encouraging letters were received from the Reverends\r\nAnna Garlin Spencer (R. I.), Ada C. Bowles and Phebe A. Hanaford\r\n(Mass.); from Mrs. Julia Foster and her daughters, Rachel and Julia,\r\nin Berlin; from Mrs. Caroline E. Merrick (La.), Mrs. Emma C. Bascom,\r\nof Wisconsin University, and friends and workers in all parts of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThe convention adopted a comprehensive plan of work submitted by Mrs.\r\nBlake, Miss Hindman and Mrs. Colby.[27] At the last session Miss\r\nAnthony made a strong, practical speech on the Present Status of the\r\nWoman Suffrage Question, and Mrs. Stanton closed the convention.\r\n\r\nA number of ministers on the following Sunday took as a text the\r\nresolution which had been discussed so vigorously, and used it as an\r\nargument against the enfranchisement of women, some of them going so\r\nfar as to denounce the suffrage advocates as infidels and the movement\r\nitself as atheistic and immoral. They wholly ignored the facts--first,\r\nthat the resolution was merely against the dogmas which had been\r\nincorporated into the creeds, and was simply a demand that Christian\r\nministers should teach and enforce only the fundamental declarations\r\nof the Scriptures; second, that there was an emphatic division of\r\nopinion among the members on the resolution; third, that by consent it\r\nwas laid on the table; and fourth, that even had it been adopted, it\r\nwas neither atheistic nor immoral.\r\n\r\nOn February 6, 1885, Thomas W. Palmer (Mich.) brought up in the Senate\r\nthe joint resolution for a Sixteenth Amendment which had been\r\nfavorably reported by the Select Committee on Woman Suffrage the\r\nprevious winter, and in its support made a masterly argument which has\r\nnot been surpassed in the fifteen years that have since elapsed,\r\nsaying in part:\r\n\r\n     This resolution involves the consideration of the broadest step\r\n     in the progress of the struggle for human liberty that has ever\r\n     been submitted to any ruler or to any legislative body. Its\r\n     taking is pregnant with wide changes in the pathway of future\r\n     civilization. Its obstruction will delay and cripple our\r\n     advancement. The trinity of principles which Lord Chatham called\r\n     the \"Bible of the English Constitution,\" the Magna Charta, the\r\n     Petition of Rights, and the Bill of Rights, are towering\r\n     landmarks in the history of our race, but they immediately\r\n     concerned but few at the time of their erection.\r\n\r\n     The Declaration of Independence by the colonists and its\r\n     successful assertion, the establishment of the right of petition,\r\n     the abolition of imprisonment for debt, the property\r\n     qualification for suffrage in nearly all the States, the\r\n     recognition of the right of women to earn, hold, enjoy and devise\r\n     property, are proud and notable gains.\r\n\r\n     The emancipation of 4,000,000 slaves and the subsequent extension\r\n     of suffrage to the male adults among them were measures enlarging\r\n     the possibilities of freedom, the full benefits of which have yet\r\n     to be realized; but the political emancipation of 26,000,000 of\r\n     our citizens, equal to us in most essential respects and superior\r\n     to us in many, it seems to me would translate our nation, almost\r\n     at a bound, to the broad plateau of universal equality and\r\n     co-operation to which all these blood-stained and prayer-worn\r\n     steps have surely led.\r\n\r\n     Like life insurance and the man who carried the first umbrella,\r\n     the inception of this movement was greeted with derision. Born of\r\n     an apparently hopeless revolt against unjust discrimination,\r\n     unequal statutes, and cruel constructions of courts, it has\r\n     pressed on and over ridicule, malice, indifference and\r\n     conservatism, until it stands in the gray dawn before the most\r\n     powerful legislative body on earth and challenges final\r\n     consideration.\r\n\r\n     The laws which degraded our wives have been everywhere repealed\r\n     or modified, and our children may now be born of free women. Our\r\n     sisters have been recognized as having brains as well as hearts,\r\n     and as being capable of transacting their own business affairs.\r\n     New avenues of self-support have been found and profitably\r\n     entered upon, and the doors of our colleges have ceased to creak\r\n     their dismay at the approach of women. Twelve States have\r\n     extended limited suffrage through their Legislatures, and three\r\n     Territories admit all citizens of suitable age to the ballot-box,\r\n     while from no single locality in which it has been tried comes\r\n     any word but that of satisfaction concerning the experiment.\r\n\r\n     The spirit of inquiry attendant upon the agitation and discussion\r\n     of this question has permeated every neighborhood in the land,\r\n     and none can be so blind as to miss the universal development in\r\n     self-respect, self-reliance, general intelligence and increased\r\n     capacity among our women. They have lost none of the womanly\r\n     graces, but by fitting themselves for counselors and mental\r\n     companions have benefited man, more perhaps than themselves.\r\n\r\n     In considering the objections to this extension of the suffrage\r\n     we are fortunate in finding them grouped in the adverse report of\r\n     the minority of your committee, and also in confidently\r\n     assuming, from the acknowledged ability and evident earnestness\r\n     of the distinguished Senators who prepared it, that all is\r\n     contained therein in the way of argument or protest which is left\r\n     to the opponents of this reform after thirty-seven years of\r\n     discussion. I wish that every Senator would examine this report\r\n     and note how many of its reasonings are self-refuting and how few\r\n     even seem to warrant further antagonism.\r\n\r\n     They cite the physical superiority of man, but offer no amendment\r\n     to increase the voting power of a Sullivan or to disfranchise the\r\n     halt, the lame, the blind or the sick. They regard the manly head\r\n     of the family as its only proper representative, but would not\r\n     exclude the adult bachelor sons. They urge disability to perform\r\n     military service as fatal to full citizenship, but would hardly\r\n     consent to resign their own rights because they have passed the\r\n     age of conscription; or to question those of Quakers, who will\r\n     not fight, or of professional men and civic officials, who, like\r\n     mothers, are regarded as of more use to the State at home.\r\n\r\n     They are dismayed by a vision of women in attendance at caucuses\r\n     at late hours of the night, but doubtless enjoy their presence at\r\n     balls and entertainments until the early dawn. They deprecate the\r\n     appearance of women at political meetings, but in my State women\r\n     have attended such meetings for years upon the earnest\r\n     solicitation of those in charge, and the influence of their\r\n     presence has been good. Eloquent women are employed by State\r\n     committees of all parties to canvass in their interests and are\r\n     highly valued and respected....\r\n\r\n     They object that many women do not desire the suffrage and that\r\n     some would not exercise it. It is probably true, as often\r\n     claimed, that many slaves did not desire emancipation in\r\n     1863--and there are men in most communities who do not vote, but\r\n     we hear of no freedman to-day who asks re-enslavement, and no\r\n     proposition is offered to disfranchise all men because some\r\n     neglect their duty.\r\n\r\n     The minority profess a willingness to have this measure\r\n     considered as a local issue rather than a national one, but those\r\n     who recall the failures to extend the ballot to black men, in the\r\n     most liberal Northern States, by a popular vote, may be excused\r\n     if they question their frankness in suggesting this transfer of\r\n     responsibility. The education of the people of a whole State on\r\n     this particular question is a much more laborious and expensive\r\n     work than an appeal to the several Legislatures. The subject\r\n     would be much more likely to receive intelligent treatment at the\r\n     hands of the picked men of a State, where calm discussion may be\r\n     had, than at the polls where prejudice and tradition oftentimes\r\n     exert a more potent influence than logic and justice. To refuse\r\n     this method to those to whom we are bound by the dearest ties\r\n     betrays an indifference to their requests or an inexplicable\r\n     adhesion to prejudice, which is only sought to be defended by an\r\n     asserted regard for women, that to me seems most illogical.\r\n\r\n     I share no fears of the degradation of women by the ballot. I\r\n     believe rather that it will elevate men. I believe the tone of\r\n     our politics will be higher, that our caucuses will be more\r\n     jealously guarded and our conventions more orderly and decorous.\r\n     I believe the polls will be freed from the vulgarity and\r\n     coarseness which now too often surround them, and that the\r\n     polling booths, instead of being in the least attractive parts of\r\n     a ward or town, will be in the most attractive; instead of being\r\n     in stables, will be in parlors. I believe the character of\r\n     candidates will be more closely scrutinized and that better\r\n     officers will be chosen to make and administer the laws. I\r\n     believe that the casting of the ballot will be invested with a\r\n     seriousness--I had almost said a sanctity--second only to a\r\n     religious observance.\r\n\r\n     The objections enumerated above appear to be the only profferings\r\n     against this measure excepting certain fragmentary quotations and\r\n     deductions from the sacred Scriptures; and here, Mr. President, I\r\n     desire to enter my most solemn protest. The opinions of Paul and\r\n     Peter as to what was the best policy for the struggling churches\r\n     under their supervision, in deferring to the prejudices of the\r\n     communities which they desired to attract and benefit, were not\r\n     inspirations for the guidance of our civilization in matters of\r\n     political co-operation; and every apparent inhibition of the\r\n     levelment of the caste of sex may be neutralized by selections of\r\n     other paragraphs and by the general spirit and trend of the Holy\r\n     Book.... Sir, my reverence for this grandest of all compilations,\r\n     human or divine, compels a protest against its being cast into\r\n     the street as a barricade against every moral, political and\r\n     social reform; lest, when the march of progress shall have swept\r\n     on and over to its consummation, it may appear to the superficial\r\n     observer that it is the Bible which has been overthrown and not\r\n     its erroneous interpretation.\r\n\r\n     If with our present experience of the needs and dangers of\r\n     co-operative government and our present observation of woman's\r\n     social and economic status, we could divest ourselves of our\r\n     traditions and prejudices, and the question of suffrage should\r\n     come up for incorporation into a new organic law, a distinction\r\n     based upon sex would not be entertained for a moment. It seems to\r\n     me that we should divest ourselves to the utmost extent possible\r\n     of these entanglements of tradition, and judicially examine three\r\n     questions relative to the proposed extension of suffrage: First,\r\n     Is it right? Second, Is it desirable? Third, Is it expedient? If\r\n     these be determined affirmatively our duty is plain.\r\n\r\n     If the right of the governed and the taxed to a voice in\r\n     determining by whom they shall be governed and to what extent and\r\n     for what purposes they may be taxed is not a natural right, it is\r\n     nevertheless a right to the declaration and establishment of\r\n     which by the fathers we owe all that we possess of liberty. They\r\n     declared taxation without representation to be tyranny, and\r\n     grappled with the most powerful nation of their day in a\r\n     seven-years' struggle for the overthrow of such tyranny. It\r\n     appears incredible to me that any one can indorse the principles\r\n     proclaimed by the patriots of 1776 and deny their application to\r\n     women.\r\n\r\n     Samuel Adams said: \"Representation and legislation, as well as\r\n     taxation, are inseparable, according to the spirit of our\r\n     Constitution and of all others that are free.\" Again, he said:\r\n     \"No man can be justly taxed by, or bound in conscience to obey,\r\n     any law to which he has not given his consent in person or by his\r\n     representative.\" And again: \"No man can take another's property\r\n     from him without his consent. This is the law of nature; and a\r\n     violation of it is the same thing whether it is done by one man,\r\n     who is called a king, or by five hundred of another\r\n     denomination.\"\r\n\r\n     James Otis, in speaking of the rights of the colonists as\r\n     descendants of Englishmen; said they \"were not to be cheated out\r\n     of them by any phantom of virtual representation or any other\r\n     fiction of law or politics.\" Again: \"No such phrase as virtual\r\n     representation is known in law or constitution. It is altogether\r\n     a subtlety and illusion, wholly unfounded and absurd.\"\r\n\r\n     The Declaration of Independence asserts that, to secure the\r\n     inalienable rights to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness,\r\n     governments are instituted among men, \"deriving their just powers\r\n     from the consent of the governed.\"\r\n\r\n     Benjamin Franklin wrote that \"liberty or freedom consists in\r\n     having an actual share in the appointment of those who frame the\r\n     laws and who are the guardians of every man's life, property and\r\n     peace;\" that \"they who have no voice nor vote in the electing of\r\n     representatives do not enjoy liberty, but are absolutely enslaved\r\n     to those who have votes and to their representatives.\"\r\n\r\n     James Madison said: \"Under every view of the subject, it seems\r\n     indispensable that the mass of the citizens should not be without\r\n     a voice in making the laws which they are to obey, and in\r\n     choosing the magistrates who are to administer them.\" ...\r\n\r\n     The right of women to personal representation through the ballot\r\n     seems to me unassailable, wherever the right of man is conceded\r\n     and exercised. I can conceive of no possible abstract\r\n     justification for the exclusion of the one and the inclusion of\r\n     the other.\r\n\r\n     Is the recognition of this right desirable? The earliest mention\r\n     of the Saxon people is found in the Germany of Tacitus, and in\r\n     his terse description of them he states that \"in all grave\r\n     matters they consult their women.\" Can we afford to dispute the\r\n     benefit of this counseling in the advancement of our race?\r\n\r\n     The measure of the civilization of any nation may be no more\r\n     surely ascertained by its consumption of salt than by the social,\r\n     economic and political status of its women. It is not enough for\r\n     contentment that we assert the superiority of our women in\r\n     intelligence, virtue, and self-sustaining qualities, but we must\r\n     consider the profit to them and to the State in their further\r\n     advancement.\r\n\r\n     Our statistics are lamentably meager in information as to the\r\n     status of our women outside their mere enumeration, but we learn\r\n     that in a single State 42,000 are assessed and pay one-eleventh\r\n     of the total burden of taxation, with no voice in its\r\n     disbursements. From the imperfect gleaning of the Tenth Census we\r\n     learn that of the total enumerated bread-winners of the United\r\n     States more than one-seventh are women.... That these 2,647,157\r\n     citizens of whom we have official information labor from\r\n     necessity and are everywhere underpaid is within the knowledge\r\n     and observation of every Senator upon this floor. Only the\r\n     Government makes any pretense of paying women in accordance with\r\n     the labor performed--without submitting them to the competition\r\n     of their starving sisters, whose natural dignity and self-respect\r\n     have suffered from being driven by the fierce pressure of want\r\n     into the few and crowded avenues for the exchange of their labor\r\n     for bread. Is it not the highest exhibit of the moral superiority\r\n     of our women that so very few consent to exchange pinching penury\r\n     for gilded vice?\r\n\r\n     Will the possession of the ballot multiply and widen these\r\n     avenues to self-support and independence? The most thoughtful\r\n     women who have given the subject thorough examination believe it,\r\n     and I can not but infer that many men, looking only to their own\r\n     selfish interests, fear it.\r\n\r\n     History teaches that every class which has assumed political\r\n     responsibility has been materially elevated and improved thereby,\r\n     and I can not believe that the rule would have an exception in\r\n     the women of to-day. I do not say that to the idealized women so\r\n     generally described by obstructionists--the dainty darlings whose\r\n     prototypes are to be found in the heroines of Walter Scott and\r\n     Fenimore Cooper--immediate awakening would come; but to the\r\n     toilers, the wage-workers and the women of affairs, the\r\n     consequent enlargement of possibilities would give new courage\r\n     and stimulate to new endeavor, and the State would be the gainer\r\n     thereby.\r\n\r\n     The often-urged fear that the ignorant and vicious would swarm to\r\n     the polls while the intelligent and virtuous would stand aloof,\r\n     is fully met by the fact that the former class has never asked\r\n     for the suffrage or shown interest in its seeking, while the\r\n     hundreds of thousands of petitioners are from our best and\r\n     noblest women, including those whose efforts for the amelioration\r\n     of the wrongs and sufferings of others have won for them\r\n     imperishable tablets in the temple of humanity. Would fear be\r\n     entertained that the State would suffer mortal harm if, by some\r\n     strange revolution, its exclusive control should be turned over\r\n     to an oligarchy composed of such women as have been and are\r\n     identified with the agitation for the political emancipation of\r\n     their sex? Saloons, brothels and gaming-houses might vanish\r\n     before such an administration; wars avoidable with safety and\r\n     honor might not be undertaken, and taxes might be diverted to\r\n     purposes of general sanitation and higher education, but neither\r\n     in these respects nor in the efforts to lift the bowed and\r\n     strengthen the weak would the right to life, liberty and the\r\n     pursuit of happiness be placed in peril. Women have exercised the\r\n     highest civil powers in all ages of the world--from Zenobia to\r\n     Victoria--and have exhibited statecraft and military capacity of\r\n     high degree without detracting from their graces as women or\r\n     their virtues as mothers....\r\n\r\n     The preponderance of women in our churches, our charitable\r\n     organizations, our educational councils, has been of such use as\r\n     to suggest the benefit of their incorporation into our voting\r\n     force to the least observant. A woman who owns railroad or\r\n     manufacturing or mining stock may vote unquestioned by the side\r\n     of the brightest business men of our continent, but if she\r\n     transfers her property into real estate she loses all voice in\r\n     its control.\r\n\r\n     Their abilities, intellectual, physical and political, are as\r\n     various as ours, and they err who set up any single standard,\r\n     however lovely, by which to determine the rights, needs and\r\n     possibilities of the sex. To me the recognition of their capacity\r\n     for full citizenship is right and desirable, and it only remains\r\n     to consider whether it is safe, whether it is expedient. To this\r\n     let experience answer to the extent that the experiment has been\r\n     made.\r\n\r\n     During the first thirty years of the independence of New Jersey,\r\n     universal suffrage was limited only by a property qualification;\r\n     but we do not learn that divorces were common, that families were\r\n     more divided on political than on religious differences, that\r\n     children were neglected or that patriotism languished, although\r\n     the first seven years of that experiment were years of decimating\r\n     war, and the remaining twenty-three of poverty and\r\n     recuperation--conditions most conducive to discontent and erratic\r\n     legislation.\r\n\r\n     The reports from Wyoming, which I have examined, are uniform in\r\n     satisfaction with the system, and I do not learn therefrom that\r\n     women require greater physical strength, fighting qualities or\r\n     masculinity to deposit a ballot than a letter or visiting card;\r\n     while in their service as jurors they have exhibited greater\r\n     courage than their brothers in finding verdicts against\r\n     desperadoes in accordance with the facts. Governors, judges,\r\n     officers and citizens unite in praises of the influence of women\r\n     upon the making and execution of wholesome laws.\r\n\r\n     In Washington Territory, last fall, out of a total vote of 40,000\r\n     there were 12,000 ballots cast by women, and everywhere friends\r\n     were rejoiced and opponents silenced as apprehended dangers\r\n     vanished upon approach. Some of the comments of converted\r\n     newspaper editors which have reached us are worthy of\r\n     preservation and future reference. The elections were quiet and\r\n     peaceable for the first time; the brawls of brutal men gave place\r\n     to the courtesies of social intercourse; saloons were closed, and\r\n     nowhere were the ladies insulted or in any way annoyed. Women\r\n     vote intelligently and safely, and it does not appear that their\r\n     place is solely at home any more than that the farmer should\r\n     never leave his farm, the mechanic his shop, the teacher his\r\n     desk, the clergyman his study, or the professional man his\r\n     office, for the purpose of expressing his wishes and opinions at\r\n     the tribunal of the ballot-box.\r\n\r\n     To-day--and to a greater extent in the near future--we are\r\n     confronted with political conditions dangerous to the integrity\r\n     of our nation. In the unforeseen but constant absorption of\r\n     immigrants and former bondmen into a vast army of untrained\r\n     voters, without restrictions as to the intelligence, character or\r\n     patriotism, many political economists see the material for\r\n     anarchy and public demoralization. It is claimed that the\r\n     necessities of parties compel subserviency to the lawless and\r\n     vicious classes in our cities, and that, without the addition of\r\n     a counterbalancing element, the enactment and enforcement of\r\n     wholesome statutes will soon be impossible. Fortunately that\r\n     needed element is not far to seek. It stands at the door of the\r\n     Congress urging annexation. In its strivings for justice it has\r\n     cried aloud in petitions from the best of our land, and more than\r\n     one-third of the present voters of five States have indorsed its\r\n     cause. Its advocates are no longer the ridiculed few, but the\r\n     respected many. A list of the leaders of progressive thought of\r\n     this generation who espouse and urge this reform would be too\r\n     long and comprehensive for recital.\r\n\r\n     Mr. President, I do not ask the submission of this amendment, nor\r\n     shall I urge its adoption, because it is desired by a portion of\r\n     the American women, although in intelligence, property and\r\n     numbers that portion would seem to have every requisite for the\r\n     enforcement of their demands; neither are we bound to give undue\r\n     regard to the timidity and hesitation of that possibly larger\r\n     portion who shrink from additional responsibilities; but I ask\r\n     and shall urge it because the nation has need of the co-operation\r\n     of women in all directions.\r\n\r\n     The war power of every government compels, upon occasion, all\r\n     citizens of suitable age and physique to leave their homes,\r\n     families and avocations to be merged in armies, whether they be\r\n     willing or unwilling, craven or bold, patriotic or indifferent,\r\n     and no one gainsays the right, because the necessities of State\r\n     require their services. We have passed the harsh stages incident\r\n     to our permanent institution. We have conquered our independence,\r\n     conquered the respect of European powers, conquered our neighbors\r\n     on the western borders, and at vast cost of life and waste have\r\n     conquered our internal differences and emerged a nation\r\n     unchallenged from without or within. The great questions of the\r\n     future conduct of our people are to be economic and social ones.\r\n     No one doubts the superiority of womanly instincts, and\r\n     consequent thought in the latter, and the repeated failures and\r\n     absurdities exhibited by male legislators in the treatment of the\r\n     former, should give pause to any assertion of superiority there.\r\n\r\n     The day has come when the counsel and service of women are\r\n     required by the highest interests of the State, and who shall\r\n     gainsay their conscription? We place the ballot in the keeping of\r\n     immigrants who have grown middle-aged or old in the environment\r\n     of governments dissimilar to the spirit and purpose of ours, and\r\n     we do well, because the responsibility accompanying the trust\r\n     tends to examination, comparison and consequent political\r\n     education; but we decline to avail ourselves of the aid of our\r\n     daughters, wives and mothers, who were born and are already\r\n     educated under our system, reading the same newspapers, books and\r\n     periodicals as ourselves, proud of our common history, tenacious\r\n     of our theories of human rights and solicitous for our future\r\n     progress. Whatever may have been wisest as to the extension of\r\n     suffrage to this tender and humane class when wars of assertion\r\n     or conquest were likely to be considered, to-day and to-morrow\r\n     and thereafter no valid reason seems assignable for longer\r\n     neglect to avail ourselves of their association.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[26] This chapter closes with the speech in favor of woman suffrage by\r\nThomas W. Palmer in the U. S. Senate.\r\n\r\n[27] The primal object of the National Woman Suffrage Association has\r\nbeen from its foundation to secure the submission by the Congress of a\r\nSixteenth Amendment which shall prohibit the several States from\r\ndisfranchising United States citizens on account of sex. To this end\r\nall State societies should see that senators and members of Congress\r\nare constantly appealed to by their constituents to labor for the\r\npassage of this amendment by the next Congress.\r\n\r\nWoman suffrage associations in the several States are advised to push\r\nthe question to a vote in their respective Legislatures. The time for\r\nagitation alone has passed, and the time for aggressive action has\r\ncome. It will be found by a close examination of many State\r\nconstitutions that by the liberal provisions of their Bill of\r\nRights--often embodied in Article I--the women of the State can be\r\nenfranchised without waiting for the tedious and hopeless proviso of a\r\nconstitutional amendment....\r\n\r\nIn States where there has been little or no agitation we recommend the\r\npassage of laws granting School Suffrage to women. This first step in\r\npolitics is an incentive to larger usefulness and aids greatly in\r\nfamiliarizing women with the use of the ballot.\r\n\r\nWe do not specially recommend Municipal Suffrage, as we think that the\r\nagitation expended for the fractional measure had better be directed\r\ntowards obtaining the passage of a Full Suffrage Bill, but we leave\r\nthis to the discretion of the States.\r\n\r\nThe acting Vice-President in every State must hold a yearly convention\r\nin the capital or some large town. No efficient organization can exist\r\nwithout some such annual reunion of the friends.\r\n\r\nIn each county there should be a county woman suffrage society\r\nauxiliary to the State; in each town or village a local society\r\nauxiliary to the county. Friends desirous of forming a society should\r\nmeet, even though few in number, and organize.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL SUFFRAGE CONVENTION OF 1886.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Eighteenth national convention met in the Church of Our Father,\r\nWashington, D. C., Feb. 17-19, 1886, presided over by Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony, vice-president-at-large, with twenty-three States\r\nrepresented. In her opening address Miss Anthony paid an eloquent\r\ntribute to her old friend and co-laborer, their absent president, Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton; sketched the history of the movement for the\r\npast thirty-six years, and described the first suffrage meeting ever\r\nheld in Washington. This had been conducted by Ernestine L. Rose and\r\nherself in 1854, and the audience consisted of twenty or thirty\r\npersons gathered in an upper room of a private house. To-night she\r\nfaced a thousand interested listeners.\r\n\r\nThe first address was given by Mrs. Sarah M. Perkins (O.), Are Women\r\nCitizens? \"While suffrage will not revolutionize the world,\" she said,\r\n\"the door of the millennium will have a little child's hand on the\r\nlatch when the mothers of the nation have equal power with its\r\nfathers.\"\r\n\r\nIn the evening Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby addressed the audience on The\r\nRelation of the Woman Suffrage Movement to the Labor Question. She\r\nbegan by saying, \"All revolutions of thought must be allied to\r\npractical ends.\" After sketching those already attained by women, she\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n     The danger threatens that, having accomplished all these so\r\n     thoroughly and successfully that they no longer need our help and\r\n     already scarcely own their origin, we will be left without the\r\n     connecting line between the abstract right on which we stand and\r\n     the common heart and sympathy which must be enlisted for our\r\n     cause ere it can succeed. Why is it that, having accomplished so\r\n     much, the woman suffrage movement does not force itself as a\r\n     vital issue into the thoughts of the masses? Is it not because\r\n     the ends which it most prominently seeks do not enlist the\r\n     self-interest of mankind, and those palpable wrongs which it had\r\n     in early days to combat have now almost entirely disappeared?...\r\n\r\n     We need to vitalize our movement by allying it with great\r\n     non-partisan questions, and many of these are involved in the\r\n     interests of the wage-earning classes.... We need to labor to\r\n     secure a change of the conditions under which workingwomen live.\r\n     We need to help them to educative and protective measures, to\r\n     better pay, to better knowledge how to make the most of their\r\n     resources, to better training, to protection against frauds, to\r\n     shelter when health and heart fail. We must help them to see the\r\n     connection between the ballot and better hours, exclusion of\r\n     children from factories, compulsory education, free\r\n     kindergartens; between the ballot and laws relating to liability\r\n     of employers, savings banks, adulteration of food and a thousand\r\n     things which it may secure when in the hands of enlightened and\r\n     virtuous people.\r\n\r\nMiss Ada C. Sweet, who for a number of years occupied the unique\r\nposition of pension agent in Chicago, supplemented Mrs. Colby's\r\nremarks by urging all women to work for the ballot in order to come to\r\nthe rescue of their fellow-women in the hospitals, asylums and other\r\ninstitutions. She emphasized her remarks by recounting instances of\r\npersonal knowledge.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Rush R. Shippen, pastor of All Souls Unitarian Church of\r\nWashington, a consistent advocate of equal suffrage, spoke on woman's\r\nadvance in every department of the world's work, on the evolution of\r\nthat work itself and the necessity for a continued progress in\r\nconditions.\r\n\r\nMrs. May Wright Sewall presented a comprehensive report of the year's\r\nwork of the executive committee. The Edmunds Bill had been a special\r\npoint of attack because of its arbitrary disfranchisement of Utah\r\nwomen, and Mrs. Zerelda G. Wallace (Ind.) had written a personal plea\r\nagainst it to every member of the House. At the close of this report a\r\nvote on woman suffrage was called for. The audience voted unanimously\r\nin favor, except one man whose \"no\" called forth much laughter. Miss\r\nAnthony said she sympathized with him, as she had been laughed at all\r\nher life.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sallie Clay Bennett (Ky.), whose specialty was the Bible argument\r\nfor woman's equality, said in the course of her remarks: \"I am filled\r\nwith shame and sorrow that from listening to men, instead of studying\r\nthe Bible for myself, I did once think that the God who said He came\r\ninto the world to preach glad tidings to the poor, to break every\r\nyoke and to set the prisoners free, had really come to rivet the\r\nchains with which sin had bound the women, and to forge a gag for them\r\nmore cruel and silencing than that put into their mouths by heathen\r\nmen; for in many heathen nations women were once selected to preside\r\nat their most sacred altars.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Mary F. Eastman (Mass), in an impressive address, said:\r\n\r\n     I asked a friend what phase of the subject I should talk about\r\n     to-night. She answered, \"The despair of it.\".. Can you conceive\r\n     what it is to native-born American women citizens, accustomed to\r\n     the advantages of our schools, our churches and the mingling of\r\n     our social life, to ask over and over again for so simple a thing\r\n     as that \"we, the people,\" should mean women as well as men; that\r\n     our Constitution should mean exactly what it says?...\r\n\r\n     Men tell us that they speak for us. There is no companionship of\r\n     women as equals permitted in the State. A man can not represent a\r\n     woman's opinion. It was in inspiration that magnificent\r\n     Declaration of Independence was framed. Men builded better than\r\n     they knew; they were at the highest perception of principles; but\r\n     after declaring this magnificent principle they went back on\r\n     it....\r\n\r\n     Although I hold the attitude of a petitioner, I come not with the\r\n     sense that men have any right to give. Our forefathers erected\r\n     barriers which exclude women. I want to press it into the\r\n     consciousness of the legislator and of the individual citizen\r\n     that he is personally responsible for the continuance of this\r\n     injustice. We ask that men take down the barriers. We do not come\r\n     to pledge that we will be a unit on temperance or virtue or high\r\n     living, but we want the right to speak for ourselves, as men\r\n     speak for themselves.\r\n\r\nMrs. Caroline Hallowell Miller (Md.) spoke strongly on A Case in\r\nPoint. Mrs. Elizabeth Avery Meriwether, of St. Louis, devoted her\r\nremarks chiefly to a caustic criticism of Senator George G. Vest, who\r\nhad recently declared himself uncompromisingly opposed to woman\r\nsuffrage. He was made the target of a number of spicy remarks, and\r\nsome of the newspaper correspondents insisted that the presence of the\r\nsuffrage convention in the city was responsible for the Senator's\r\nsevere illness, which followed immediately afterwards. Mrs.\r\nMeriwether's son, Lee, paid a handsome tribute to \"strong-minded\r\nmothers\".\r\n\r\nMrs. Harriette R. Shattuck (Mass.) addressed the convention on The\r\nBasis of Our Claim, the right of every individual to make his\r\npersonality felt in the Government. Madame Clara Neymann (N. Y.) gave\r\na scholarly paper on German and American Independence Contrasted, in\r\nwhich she said:\r\n\r\n     The difference between the German and the American is simply\r\n     this: Germans believe in monarchism, in the rule of the Emperor\r\n     and Prince Bismarck, while Americans believe in the government by\r\n     all the people, high or low, rich or poor. You have conferred the\r\n     blessings of free citizenship upon the negro; you invite the\r\n     humblest, the lowest men to cast their vote; you make them feel\r\n     that they are sovereign human beings; you place those men above\r\n     the most virtuous, intelligent women; you set them above your own\r\n     daughters. Yes, your own child, if born a girl on this free soil,\r\n     is not free, for she stands without the pale of the Constitution.\r\n     She, and only she, is deprived of her rightful heritage.\r\n\r\n     Oh, shame upon the short-sightedness, the delinquency of American\r\n     statesmen, who will quietly look on and suffer such an injustice\r\n     to exist! Nowhere in the world is woman so highly respected as in\r\n     free America, and nowhere does she feel so keenly and deeply her\r\n     degradation. The vote--you know it full well--is the insignia of\r\n     power, of influence, of position. And from this position the\r\n     American woman is debarred.\r\n\r\n     Do you wonder at the low estimate of American politics? The\r\n     exclusion of women means the exclusion of your best men. Not\r\n     before the husband can take his wife, the brother his sister, the\r\n     father his daughter to the primary meeting, to the political\r\n     assembly and to the polls, will he himself become interested and\r\n     fulfil his duty as a voter and a citizen....\r\n\r\n     \"Look at the homes of the wealthy, or even of the large\r\n     middle-class\", it is often said; \"what shallowness and pretense\r\n     among the women; how they shrink from the responsibility of\r\n     motherhood; how they spend their days in idle gossip, in hollow\r\n     amusements; how they waste their hours in frivolities; see what\r\n     extravagant, unhallowed lives they lead\". Sad and true enough!\r\n     For there is no aristocracy so pernicious as a moneyed\r\n     aristocracy--no woman so dangerous as she who has privileges and\r\n     no corresponding duties. There is nothing so wasteful as wasted\r\n     energies, nothing so harmful as powers wrongfully directed; and\r\n     the gifts and powers of our wealthy, well-to-do women are\r\n     wrongfully directed. They are employed in the interest of vanity,\r\n     of worldly ambition, of public display, of sense gratification.\r\n\r\n     From whence arises this misdirected ambition? The harm is caused\r\n     by the false standard man holds up to woman. If men would no\r\n     longer admire the shallowness of such women they would\r\n     undoubtedly aim higher. On the one side man subordinates himself\r\n     to woman's whims and caprices, and on the other side she is made\r\n     conscious all the time of her dependence and subordination in all\r\n     that pertains to the higher interests of life; and while he makes\r\n     a slave of her, she revenges herself and makes a slave of him.\r\n     See how these women hold men down to their own low level; for\r\n     women who have no higher aspirations than their own immediate\r\n     pleasure will induce men to do the same. There is an even-handed\r\n     justice that rules this world. For every wrong society permits to\r\n     exist, society must suffer. Look what fools men are made by\r\n     foolish women--women who are brought up with the idea that they\r\n     must be ornamental, a beautiful toy for man to play with. See how\r\n     they turn around and make a toy of him, an instrument to play\r\n     upon at their leisure.\r\n\r\n     What we ask in place of all this indulgence is simple justice, a\r\n     recognition of woman's higher endowment. In giving her larger\r\n     duties to perform, nobler aims to accomplish--in making her a\r\n     responsible human being--you not only will benefit her, but will\r\n     regenerate the manhood of America....\r\n\r\n     To make the advocates of suffrage responsible for the sins of\r\n     American women is simply atrocious, since it is from these very\r\n     advocates that every reform for and among women has started; it\r\n     is they who preach simplicity, purity, devotion, and who would\r\n     gird all womanhood with the armor of self-respect and true\r\n     womanliness. That such women are compelled to come before the\r\n     public, before the Congress and the Legislatures, and pray for\r\n     such rights as are freely given to every unenlightened foreigner\r\n     is a burning shame and reflects badly upon the intelligence, the\r\n     righteousness of Legislatures and people.\r\n\r\nMuch indignation was expressed during the convention over the recent\r\naction of Gov. Gilbert A. Pierce, of the Territory of Dakota. The\r\nLegislature, composed of residents, the previous year passed a bill\r\nconferring Full Suffrage on women, which was vetoed by the Governor,\r\nan outsider appointed a short time before by President Chester A.\r\nArthur. With a stroke of the pen he prevented the enfranchisement of\r\n50,000 women.\r\n\r\nHundreds were turned away at the last evening session and there was\r\nscarcely standing room within the church. A witty and vivacious speech\r\nby Mrs. Helen M. Gougar (Ind.) was the first number on the program.\r\nMrs. Julia B. Nelson (Minn.) followed in an original dialect poem,\r\nHans Dunderkopf's Views of Equality. Mrs. Sewall showed the Absurdity\r\nof the American Woman's Disfranchisement:\r\n\r\n     The inconsistency of the present position of the American woman\r\n     is forcibly shown in that she is now making such an advance in\r\n     education, studying political science under the best teachers of\r\n     constitutional law, and enjoying such advantages at the expense\r\n     of the Government, yet is not allowed to make use of this\r\n     knowledge in the Government....\r\n\r\n     Much has been said about the need of the ballot to protect the\r\n     industrial interests of men, but is it not as ungallant as it is\r\n     illogical that they should have the ballot for their protection\r\n     while women, pressed by the same necessities, should be denied\r\n     it?...\r\n\r\n     I may perhaps put it that man is composed of brain and heart and\r\n     woman of heart and brain. We must have the brain of man and the\r\n     heart of woman employed in the higher developments to come. There\r\n     can be no great scheme that does not require to be conceived by\r\n     our brains, quickened by our hearts and carried into execution by\r\n     our skilled hands. The activities which are considered the\r\n     especial sphere of woman need more brain; the realm of State\r\n     developed by the brain of man needs more heart. Home and State\r\n     have been too long divided. Man must not neglect the interests of\r\n     home, woman must care for the State. Our public interests and\r\n     private hopes need all the subtle forces of brain and heart.\r\n\r\nAn interesting feature of these national conventions was the State\r\nreports, which contained not only valuable specific information, but\r\noften felicitous little arguments quite equal to those of the more\r\nformal addresses. Such reports were received in 1886 from thirty\r\ndifferent States. A large number of interesting letters also were\r\nread, among them one from George W. Childs, inclosing check; John W.\r\nHutchinson, Belva A. Lockwood, the Hon. J. A. Pickler, Madame\r\nDemorest, Dr. Mary F. Thomas, Lucinda B. Chandler, the Rev. Olympia\r\nBrown, Mary E. Haggart, Armenia S. White, Emma C. Bascom, Almeda B.\r\nGray and many others.\r\n\r\nA letter from Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton urged that the question of\r\nwoman suffrage should now be carried into the churches and church\r\nconventions for their approval, and that more enlightened teaching\r\nfrom the pulpit in regard to women should be insisted upon. The letter\r\nwas accompanied by a resolution to this effect, both expressed in very\r\nstrong language. They were read first in executive session. The\r\nfollowing extracts are taken from the stenographic report of the\r\nmeeting:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Helen M. Gougar (Ind.) moved that the resolution be laid\r\n     upon the table, saying: \"A resolution something like this came\r\n     into the last convention, and it has done more to cripple my work\r\n     and that of other suffragists than anything which has happened in\r\n     the whole history of the woman suffrage movement. When you look\r\n     this country over you find the slums are opposed to us, while\r\n     some of the best leaders and advocates of woman suffrage are\r\n     among the Christian people. A bishop of the Roman Catholic Church\r\n     stood through my meeting in Peoria not long since. We can not\r\n     afford to antagonize the churches. Some of us are orthodox, and\r\n     some of us are unorthodox, but this association is for suffrage\r\n     and not for the discussion of religious dogmas. I can not stay\r\n     within these borders if that resolution is adopted, from the fact\r\n     that my hands would be tied. I hope it will not go into open\r\n     convention for debate.\r\n\r\n     MRS. PERKINS (O.): I think we ought to pay due consideration and\r\n     respect to our beloved president. I have no objection to sending\r\n     missionaries to the churches asking them to pay attention to\r\n     woman suffrage; but I do not think the churches are our greatest\r\n     enemies. They might have been so in Mrs. Stanton's early days,\r\n     but to-day they are our best helpers. If it were not for their\r\n     co-operation I could not get a hearing before the public. And now\r\n     that they are coming to meet us half way, do not throw stones at\r\n     them. I hope that resolution, as worded, will not go into the\r\n     convention.\r\n\r\n     MRS. MERIWETHER (Mo.): I think the resolution could be amended so\r\n     as to offend no one. The ministers falsely construe the\r\n     Scriptures. We can overwhelm them with arguments for woman\r\n     suffrage--with Biblical arguments. We can hurl them like shot and\r\n     shell. Herbert Spencer once wrote an article on the different\r\n     biases which distort the human mind, and among the first he\r\n     reckoned the theological bias. In Christ's time and in the early\r\n     Christian days there was no liberty, every one was under the\r\n     despotism of the Roman Cæsars, but women were on an equality with\r\n     men, and the religion that Christ taught included women equally\r\n     with men. He made none of the invidious distinctions which the\r\n     churches make to-day.\r\n\r\n     MRS. SHATTUCK (Mass.): We did not pass the resolution of last\r\n     year, so it could not have harmed anybody. But I protest against\r\n     this fling at masculine interpretation of the Scriptures.\r\n\r\n     MRS. MINOR (Mo.): I object to the whole thing--resolution and\r\n     letter both. I believe in confining ourselves to woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n     MRS. COLBY (Neb.): I was on that committee of resolutions last\r\n     year and wrote the modified one which was presented, and I am\r\n     willing to stand by it. I have not found that it hurts the work,\r\n     save with a few who do not know what the resolution was, or what\r\n     was said about it. The discussion was reported word for word in\r\n     the _Woman's Tribune_ and I think no one who read it would say\r\n     that it was irreligious or lacked respect for the teachings of\r\n     Christ. I believe we must say something in the line of Mrs.\r\n     Stanton's idea. She makes no fling at the church. She wants us to\r\n     treat the Church as we have the State--viz., negotiate for more\r\n     favorable action. We have this fact to deal with--that in no high\r\n     orthodox body have women been accorded any privileges.\r\n\r\n     EDWARD M. DAVIS (Penn.): I think we have never had a resolution\r\n     offered here so important as this. We have never had a measure\r\n     brought forward which would produce better results. I agree\r\n     entirely with Mrs. Stanton on this thing, that the church is the\r\n     greatest barrier to woman's progress. We do not want to proclaim\r\n     ourselves an irreligious or a religious people. This question of\r\n     religion does not touch us either way. We are neutral.\r\n\r\n     MADAME NEYMANN (N. Y.): Because the clergy has been one-sided, we\r\n     do not want to be one-sided. I know of no one for whom I have a\r\n     greater admiration than for Mrs. Stanton. Her resolution\r\n     antagonizes no one.\r\n\r\n     MRS. BROOKS (Neb.): Let us do this work in such a way that it\r\n     will not arouse the opposition of the most bigoted clergyman. All\r\n     this discussion only shows that the old superstitions have got to\r\n     be banished.\r\n\r\n     MRS. SNOW (Me.): Mrs. Stanton wishes to convert the clergy.\r\n\r\n     MRS. DUNBAR (Md.): I don't want the resolution referred back to\r\n     the committee, out of respect to Mrs. Stanton and the manner in\r\n     which she has been treated by the clergy. I do not want to lose\r\n     the wording of the original resolution, and therefore move that\r\n     it be taken up here.\r\n\r\n     MRS. GOUGAR: I think it is quite enough to undertake to change\r\n     the National Constitution without undertaking to change the\r\n     Bible. I heartily agree with Mrs. Stanton in her idea of sending\r\n     delegates to church councils and convocations, but I do not\r\n     sanction this resolution which starts out--\"The greatest barrier\r\n     to woman's emancipation is found in the superstitions of the\r\n     church.\" That is enough in itself to turn the entire church,\r\n     Catholic and Protestant, against us.\r\n\r\n     MRS. NELSON (Minn.): The resolution is directed against the\r\n     superstitions of the church and not against the church, but I\r\n     think it would be taken as against the church.\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY (N. Y.): As the resolution contains the essence of\r\n     the letter, I move that the whole subject go to the Plan of Work\r\n     Committee.\r\n\r\n     The meeting adjourned without action, and on Friday morning the\r\n     same subject was resumed. A motion to table Mrs. Stanton's\r\n     resolution was lost. Miss Anthony then moved that both letter and\r\n     resolution be placed in her hands, as the representative of the\r\n     president of the association, to be read in open convention\r\n     without indorsement. \"I do not want any one to say that we young\r\n     folks strangle Mrs. Stanton's thought.\"\r\n\r\n     THE REV. DR. MCMURDY (D. C.): I do not intend to oppose or favor\r\n     the motion, but as a clergyman and a High Church Episcopalian, I\r\n     can not see any particular objections to Mrs. Stanton's letter.\r\n     The Scriptures must be interpreted naturally. Whenever Paul's\r\n     remarks are brought up I explain them in the light of this\r\n     nineteenth century as contrasted with the first.\r\n\r\n     It was finally voted that the letter be read without the\r\n     resolution.\r\n\r\nThe resolution was brought up later in open convention and the final\r\nvote resulted in 32 ayes and 24 noes. This was not at that time a\r\ndelegate body, but usually only those voted who were especially\r\nconnected with the work of the association. Before the present\r\nconvention adjourned a basis of delegate representation was adopted,\r\nand provision made that hereafter only regularly accredited delegates\r\nshould be entitled to vote.\r\n\r\nThe resolution calling upon Congress to take the necessary measures to\r\nsecure the ballot for women through an amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution, was vigorously opposed by the Southern delegates as\r\ncontrary to States' Rights, but was finally adopted. There was some\r\ndiscussion also on the resolution which condemned the disfranchising\r\nof Gentile as well as Mormon women, but which approved the action of\r\nCongress in making disfranchisement a punishment for the crime of\r\npolygamy. A difference of opinion was shown in regard to the latter\r\nclause. This closed the convention.\r\n\r\nAs a favorable Senate report was pending, no hearing was held before\r\nthat committee.\r\n\r\nThe House Judiciary Committee[28] granted a hearing on the morning of\r\nFebruary 20. The speakers, as usual, were introduced to the chairman\r\nof the committee by Miss Anthony. The first of these, Mrs. Virginia L.\r\nMinor, had attempted to vote in St. Louis, been refused permission,\r\ncarried her case to the Supreme Court and received an adverse\r\ndecision.[29] Miss Anthony said in reference to this decision: \"Chief\r\nJustice Waite declared the United States had no voters. The Dred Scott\r\nDecision was that the negro, not being a voter, was not a citizen. The\r\nSupreme Court decided that women, although citizens, were not\r\nprotected in the rights of citizenship by the Fourteenth Amendment.\"\r\nMrs. Minor said in part:\r\n\r\n     I do not stand here to represent rich women but poor women.\r\n     Should you give me the right to vote and deny it to my sister I\r\n     should spurn the gift. Without the ballot no class is so helpless\r\n     as the working women. If the ballot is necessary for man, it is\r\n     necessary for woman. We must have one law for all American\r\n     citizens.\r\n\r\n     The Supreme Court has half done the work. When my case came up,\r\n     and I asked them that the same law should protect me as protected\r\n     the negro, the court said, \"When the State gives you the right to\r\n     vote, we will perpetuate it; the United States has no voters.\" I\r\n     want to ask you one question. If there are no United States\r\n     voters, what right has the U. S. Court to go into the State of\r\n     New York, arrest Susan B. Anthony and condemn her under Federal\r\n     Law?[30]\r\n\r\n     Another decision of the Supreme Court said in relation to the\r\n     Fourteenth Amendment, that the negro, because of citizenship, was\r\n     made a voter in every State of the Union. The court went on to\r\n     say that it had a broader significance, that it included the\r\n     Chinese or any nationality that should become citizens. That\r\n     court has said we are citizens. If the Chinese would have the\r\n     right to vote if they were citizens, have not we the right to\r\n     vote because of citizenship?\r\n\r\n     A third decision was in the case of the United States vs. Kellar\r\n     in the State of Illinois. A man arrested for illegal voting was\r\n     brought before the court; he was born abroad and was the son of\r\n     an American woman. Justice Harlan held that because his mother\r\n     was a citizen, she had transmitted citizenship to her son,\r\n     therefore he had a right to vote. This right must have been\r\n     inherent in the mother, else she could not have transmitted it to\r\n     her son.\r\n\r\nMrs. Julia B. Nelson (Minn.), who had been for many years teaching the\r\nfreed negroes of the South, said:\r\n\r\n     What are the obligations of the Government to me, a widow,\r\n     because my husband gave his life for it? I have been forced to\r\n     think. As a law-abiding citizen and taxpayer and one who has\r\n     given all she could give to the support of this Government, I\r\n     have a right to be heard. I am teaching for it, teaching\r\n     citizens. I began teaching freedmen when it was so unpopular that\r\n     men could not have done it. The voting question met me in the\r\n     office of the mission, which sends out more women than men\r\n     because better work is done by them. A woman gets for this work\r\n     $15 per month; if capable of being a principal she has $20. A man\r\n     in this position receives $75 a month. There must be something\r\n     wrong, but I do not need to explain to you that an unrepresented\r\n     class must work at a disadvantage.\r\n\r\n     If it were granted to women to fill all positions for which they\r\n     are qualified, they would not be so largely compelled to rush\r\n     into those occupations where they are unfairly remunerated. As so\r\n     many people have faith that whatever is is right, the law as it\r\n     stands has great influence. If it puts woman down as an inferior,\r\n     she will surely be regarded as such by the people. If I am\r\n     capable of preparing citizens, I am capable of possessing the\r\n     rights of a citizen myself. I ask you to remove the barriers\r\n     which restrain women from equal opportunities and privileges with\r\n     men.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meriwether pointed out the helplessness of mothers to obtain\r\nlegal protection for themselves and their children, or to influence\r\nthe action of municipal bodies, without the suffrage. Miss Eastman\r\nsaid in the course of her address:\r\n\r\n     The first business of government is foreshadowed in the\r\n     Constitution, that it is to secure justice between man and man\r\n     by allowing no intrusion of any on the rights of others. This\r\n     principle is large in application although simple in statement.\r\n     The first words, \"We, the people,\" contain the foundation of our\r\n     claim. If we limit the application of the word \"people,\" all the\r\n     rest falls to the ground. Whatever work of government is referred\r\n     to, it all rests on its being managed by \"We, the people.\" If we\r\n     strike that out, we have lost the fundamental principle. Who are\r\n     the people? I feel that it is not my business to ask men to vote\r\n     on my right to be admitted to the franchise. I have been debarred\r\n     from my right. You hold the position to do me justice. Why should\r\n     I go to one-half of the people and ask whether so clear and\r\n     explicit a declaration as this includes me? The suffrage is not\r\n     theirs to give, and I would not get it from them easily if it\r\n     were. Neither would you get even education if you had to ask them\r\n     for it. This question is not for the people at large to settle.\r\n     Justice demands that we should be referred to the most\r\n     intelligent tribunals in the land, and not remanded to the\r\n     popular vote.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clay Bennett based her argument largely on the authority of the\r\nScriptures. Mrs. Gougar said:\r\n\r\n     We do not come as Democrats or Republicans, not as Northern or as\r\n     Southern, but as women representing a great principle. This is in\r\n     line with the Magna Charta, with the Petition of Rights, with the\r\n     Articles of Confederation, with the National Constitution. This\r\n     is in direct line of the growth of human liberty. The Declaration\r\n     of Independence says, \"Governments derive their just powers from\r\n     the consent of the governed.\" Are you making a single law which\r\n     does not touch me as much as it does you?\r\n\r\n     Questions are upon you which you can not solve without the moral\r\n     sentiment of womanhood. You need us more than we need suffrage.\r\n     In our large cities the vicious element rules. The reserve force\r\n     is in the womanhood of the nation. Woman suffrage is necessary\r\n     for the preservation of the life of the republic. To give women\r\n     the ballot is to increase the intelligent and law-abiding vote.\r\n     The tramp vote is entirely masculine. By enfranchising the women\r\n     of this country, you enfranchise humanity.\r\n\r\nMrs. Colby thus described to the committee the recent vote in Nebraska\r\non a woman suffrage amendment:\r\n\r\n     The subject was well discussed; the leading men and the majority\r\n     of the press and pulpit favored it. Everything indicated that\r\n     here at last the measure might be safely submitted to popular\r\n     vote. On election day the women went to the polling places in\r\n     nearly every precinct in the State, with their flowers, their\r\n     banners, their refreshments and their earnest pleadings. But\r\n     every saloon keeper worked against the amendment, backed by the\r\n     money and the power of the liquor league. The large foreign vote\r\n     went almost solidly against woman suffrage. Nebraska defies the\r\n     laws of the United States by allowing foreigners to vote when\r\n     they have been only six months on the soil of America. Many of\r\n     these, as yet wholly unfamiliar with the institutions of our\r\n     country, voted the ballot which was placed in their hands. The\r\n     woman suffrage amendment received but a little over one-third of\r\n     the votes cast.\r\n\r\n     Men were still so afraid women did not want to vote that only one\r\n     thing remained to convince them we were in earnest, and that was\r\n     for us to vote that way. So the next session we had another\r\n     amendment introduced, to be voted on by the men as before, but\r\n     not to take effect until ratified by a majority of the women. We\r\n     were willing to be counted if the Legislature would make it legal\r\n     to count us. It refused because the question, it said, had\r\n     already been settled by the people. Although we had worked and\r\n     pleaded and done all that women could do to obtain our rights of\r\n     citizenship, yet the Legislature looking at \"the people\" did not\r\n     see us, and refused to submit the question again. Having failed\r\n     to obtain our rights by popular vote, we now appeal to you.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony related the unsuccessful efforts of Mrs. Caroline E.\r\nMerrick and other ladies of Louisiana to have women placed on the\r\nschool boards of that State, due wholly to their disfranchisement. In\r\na forcible speech Mrs. Sewall declared:\r\n\r\n     In coming here my sense of justice is satisfied, for we belong to\r\n     this nation as well as you. This room, this building, this\r\n     committee, the whole machinery of government is supported in part\r\n     by the money of women and is for their protection as well as for\r\n     that of men....\r\n\r\n     Our question should never be partisan. We do not wish to go\r\n     before our State Legislatures crippled with the fact that an\r\n     amendment has been submitted by one party rather than the other.\r\n     The Republican party gave the ballot to the negro and claimed its\r\n     vote in return. We do not wish any party to feel it has a right\r\n     to our vote. The Senate now has a majority of Republicans and the\r\n     House of Democrats, consequently any measure which is passed by\r\n     this Congress will be unpartisan. This question should receive\r\n     support of both parties by the higher laws of the universe.\r\n     Another name for life is helpfulness. Separation of parts\r\n     belonging to one whole is death. Separation of parties on\r\n     questions not of partisan interest is death to many issues. It is\r\n     in your power to bring the parties together by that higher law of\r\n     the universe on this proposition to submit a Sixteenth Amendment\r\n     to our Legislatures, that without entanglement of partisan\r\n     interests this question can be decided.\r\n\r\nThe committee were so interested in the address of Madame Neymann that\r\nthe time of the hearing was extended in order that she might finish\r\nit. She said in part:\r\n\r\n     Why Americans, so keen in their sense of what is right and just,\r\n     should be so dull on this question of giving woman her due share\r\n     of independence, I can not comprehend. Is not this the land where\r\n     foreigners flock because they have heard the bugle call of\r\n     freedom? Why then is it that your own children, the patriotic\r\n     daughters of America, who have been reared and nurtured in free\r\n     homes, brought up under the guidance and amidst the blessings of\r\n     freedom--why is it that you hold them unworthy of the honor of\r\n     being enrolled as citizens and voters? England, Canada and even\r\n     Ireland have gone ahead of us, and was not America destined by\r\n     its tradition to be first and foremost in this important movement\r\n     of making women the equal, the true partner of man?\r\n\r\n     In a free country the national life stands in direct relation to\r\n     the home life, the public life reacts upon the family, and the\r\n     family furnishes the material for the State. The lives and the\r\n     characters of our children are influenced by the manners and\r\n     methods of our Government, and to say that mothers have no right\r\n     to be concerned in the politics of the country is simply saying\r\n     that the life and character of our children are of no concern to\r\n     us.\r\n\r\n     The citizen's liberty instead of being sacrificed by society has\r\n     to be defended by society. Who defends woman's individuality in\r\n     our modern State? Universal suffrage is the only guarantee\r\n     against despotism. Every man who believes in the subjection of\r\n     woman will play the despot whenever you give him an opportunity.\r\n\r\n     We have no right to ask if it is expedient to grant suffrage to\r\n     women. We recognize that the principle is just and justice must\r\n     be done though the heavens fall. It is small minds that bring\r\n     forth small objections. The man who believes in a just principle\r\n     trusts and confides in it, and thus we ask you to confide in\r\n     suffrage for women.\r\n\r\nOn May 6, 1886, the committee report, made by the Hon. John W. Stewart\r\n(Vt.), stated that the resolution was laid on the table. The following\r\nminority report was submitted:\r\n\r\n     In a Government by the people the ballot is at once a badge of\r\n     sovereignty and the means of exercising power. We need not for\r\n     our present purpose define the right to vote, nor inquire whence\r\n     it comes. Whether it is a natural or a political right, one\r\n     arising from social relations and duties, or a necessity\r\n     incidental to individual protection and communal welfare, is\r\n     immaterial to the discussion. Let the advocates of man's right to\r\n     participate in governmental affairs choose their own ground and\r\n     we will be content. The voting franchise exists, and it exists\r\n     because it has been seized by force or because of some right\r\n     antedating its sanction by law. Nativity does not confer it,\r\n     because aliens exercise it; it does not arise from taxation, for\r\n     many are taxed who can not vote and many vote who are not taxed.\r\n     Ability to bear arms is not the test of the voting franchise, as\r\n     many legally vote who were never able to bear arms, and others\r\n     who have become unable to do so by reason of sickness, accident\r\n     or age; nor does education mark the line, for the learned and the\r\n     illiterate meet at the ballot box.\r\n\r\n     With us a portion of the adult population have assumed to\r\n     exercise the right, admitted to exist somewhere, of governing,\r\n     and have forced another portion into the position of the\r\n     governed. That this assumption is just and wise is averred by\r\n     some and denied by others. If we call upon these rulers for a\r\n     copy of their commission they present one written by themselves.\r\n\r\n     Children, idiots and convicted felons properly belong to the\r\n     governed and not to the governing class, as they are\r\n     intellectually or morally unfit to govern. Necessity only places\r\n     them there; necessity is an absolute monarch and will be\r\n     everywhere obeyed. To this governed class has been added woman,\r\n     and we beg the House and the country to inquire why. They are\r\n     also \"people\" and we submit that they are neither moral nor\r\n     intellectual incapables, and no necessity for their\r\n     disfranchisement can be suggested; on the contrary, we believe\r\n     that they are now entitled to immediate and absolute\r\n     enfranchisement.\r\n\r\n     First: Because their own good demands it. Give woman the ballot\r\n     and she will have additional means and inducements to a broader\r\n     and better education, including a knowledge of affairs, of which\r\n     she will not fail to avail herself to the uttermost; give her the\r\n     ballot and you add to her means of protection of her person and\r\n     estate. The ballot is a powerful weapon of defense sorely needed\r\n     by those too weak to wield any other, and to take it from such\r\n     and give to those already clothed in strength and fully armed,\r\n     would appear to be unjust, unfair and unwise to one unaccustomed\r\n     to the sight. Long usage \"sanctions and sanctifies\" wrongs and\r\n     abuses, and causes cruelty to be mistaken for kindness.\r\n\r\n     The history of woman is for the most part a history of wrong and\r\n     outrage. Created the equal companion of man, she early became his\r\n     slave, and still is so in most parts of the world. In many\r\n     so-called Christian nations of Europe she is to-day yoked with\r\n     beasts and is doing the labor of beasts, while her son and\r\n     husband are serving in the army, protecting the divine right of\r\n     kings and men to slay and destroy. In the farther East she is\r\n     still more degraded, being substantially excluded from the world.\r\n     Man has not been consciously unjust to woman in the past, nor is\r\n     he now, but he believes that she is in her true sphere, not\r\n     realizing that he has fixed her sphere, and not God. This is as\r\n     true of the barbarian as of the Christian, and no more so. If the\r\n     \"unspeakable Turk\" should be solicited to open the doors of his\r\n     harem and let the inmates become free, he would be indignant,\r\n     doubtless, and would swear by the beard of the Prophet that he\r\n     never would so degrade lovely woman, who, in her sphere, was\r\n     intended to be the solace of glorious, superior man.\r\n\r\n     Yet, as man advances, woman is elevated, and her elevation in\r\n     turn advances him. No liberty ever given her has been lost or\r\n     abused or regretted. Where most has been given she has become\r\n     best. Liberty never degrades her; slavery always does. For her\r\n     good, therefore, she needs the ballot.\r\n\r\n     Second: Woman's vote is needed for the good of others. Our\r\n     horizon is misty with apparent dangers. Woman may aid in\r\n     dispelling them. She is an enemy of foreign war and domestic\r\n     turmoil; she is a friend of peace and home. Her influence for\r\n     good in many directions would be multiplied if she possessed the\r\n     ballot. She desires the homes of the land to be pure and sober;\r\n     with her help they may become so. Without her what is the\r\n     prospect in this regard?\r\n\r\n     We do not invite woman into the \"dirty pool of politics,\" nor\r\n     does she intend to enter that pool. Politics is not necessarily\r\n     unclean; if it is unclean she is not chargeable with the great\r\n     crime, for crime it is. Politics must be purified or we are lost.\r\n     To govern this great nation wisely and well is not degrading\r\n     service; to do it, all the wisdom, ability and patriotism of all\r\n     the people is required. No great moral force should be\r\n     unemployed.\r\n\r\n     But it is sometimes said that women do not desire the ballot.\r\n     Some may not; very many do not, perhaps a majority. Such\r\n     indifference can not affect the right of those who are not\r\n     indifferent. Some men, for one or other insufficient reason,\r\n     decline to vote; but no statesman has yet urged general\r\n     disfranchisement on that account. It may be true, and in our\r\n     judgment it is, that those individuals who so fail to appreciate\r\n     the rights and obligations of freemen as to deliberately refuse\r\n     to vote should be disfranchised and made aliens, but their\r\n     offense should not be visited on vigilant and patriotic citizens.\r\n     Neither male nor female suffragists can be forced to use the\r\n     ballot, and while the individuals of each class may fail to\r\n     appreciate the privilege or recognize the duty the franchise\r\n     confers, in the main it will result otherwise.\r\n\r\n     The conservative woman who feels that her present duties are as\r\n     burdensome as she can bear, when she realizes what she can\r\n     accomplish for her country and for mankind by the ballot, will as\r\n     reverently thank God for the opportunity and will as zealously\r\n     discharge her new obligations, as will her more radical sister\r\n     who has long and wearily labored and fervently prayed for the\r\n     coming of the day of equality of rights, duties and hopes.\r\n\r\n                                             E.

CASWELL.\r\n\r\n     I concur in the opinion of the minority that the resolution ought\r\n     to be adopted.\r\n\r\n                                             A. A.

SENATE--1887.\r\n\r\n\r\nAlthough the Senate Select Committee on Woman Suffrage had reported\r\nseveral times in favor of a Sixteenth Amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution which should prohibit disfranchisement on account of sex,\r\nand although Thomas W. Palmer, in 1885, had delivered a speech on the\r\nquestion in the Senate, it never had been brought to a discussion and\r\nvote.[31] Urged by the members of the National Association, and by his\r\nown strong convictions as to the justice of the cause, Senator Henry\r\nW. Blair (N. H.), on Dec. 8, 1886, called up the following, which he\r\nhad reported for the majority of the committee on February 2 of that\r\nyear:\r\n\r\n     JOINT RESOLUTION PROPOSING AN AMENDMENT TO THE CONSTITUTION OF\r\n     THE UNITED STATES EXTENDING THE RIGHT OF SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives of the\r\n     United States of America in Congress assembled (two-thirds of\r\n     each House concurring therein)_, That the following article be\r\n     proposed to the Legislatures of the several States as an\r\n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States; which, when\r\n     ratified by three-fourths of the said Legislatures, shall be\r\n     valid as part of said Constitution, namely:\r\n\r\n     SECTION 1. The right of citizens of the United States to vote\r\n     shall not be denied or abridged by the United States or by any\r\n     State on account of sex.\r\n\r\n     SECTION 2. The Congress shall have power, by appropriate\r\n     legislation, to enforce the provisions of this article.\r\n\r\nSenator Blair supported this resolution in a long and comprehensive\r\nspeech, that will be recorded in history as one of the ablest ever\r\nmade on this subject, in the course of which he said:[32]\r\n\r\n     Upon solemn occasions concerning grave public affairs, and when\r\n     large numbers of the citizens of the country desire to test the\r\n     sentiments of the people upon an amendment of the organic law in\r\n     the manner provided by the provisions of that law, it may well\r\n     become the duty of Congress to submit the proposition to the\r\n     amending power, which is the same as that which created the\r\n     original instrument itself--the electors of the several States.\r\n     It can hardly be claimed that two-thirds of each branch of\r\n     Congress must necessarily be convinced that the Constitution\r\n     should be amended, before it submits the same to the judgment of\r\n     the States.\r\n\r\n     If there be any principle upon which our form of government is\r\n     founded, and wherein it is different from aristocracies,\r\n     monarchies and despotisms, that principle is this: Every human\r\n     being of mature powers, not disqualified by ignorance, vice or\r\n     crime, is the equal of and is entitled to all the rights and\r\n     privileges which belong to any other human being under the law.\r\n\r\n     The independence, equality and dignity of all human souls is the\r\n     fundamental assertion of those who believe in what we call human\r\n     freedom. But we are informed that women are represented by men.\r\n     This can not reasonably be claimed unless it first be shown that\r\n     their consent has been given to such representation, or that they\r\n     lack the capacity to consent. But the exclusion of this class\r\n     from the suffrage deprives them of the power of assent to\r\n     representation even when they possess the requisite ability....\r\n     The Czar represents his whole people, just as much as voting men\r\n     represent women who do not vote at all.\r\n\r\n     True it is that the voting men, in excluding women and other\r\n     classes from the suffrage, by that act charge themselves with the\r\n     trust of administering justice to all, even as the monarch whose\r\n     power is based upon force is bound to rule uprightly. But if it\r\n     be true that \"all just government is founded upon the consent of\r\n     the governed,\" then the government of woman by man, without her\r\n     consent given in a sovereign capacity, even if that government be\r\n     wise and just in itself, is a violation of natural right and an\r\n     enforcement of servitude against her on the part of man. If\r\n     woman, like the infant or the defective classes, be incapable of\r\n     self-government, then republican society may exclude her from all\r\n     participation in the enactment and enforcement of the laws under\r\n     which she lives. But in that case, like the infant and the idiot\r\n     and the unconsenting subject of tyrannical forms of government,\r\n     she is ruled and not represented by man. This much I desire to\r\n     say in the beginning in reply to the broad assumption of those\r\n     who deny women the suffrage by saying that they are already\r\n     represented by their fathers, their husbands, their brothers and\r\n     their sons.\r\n\r\n     The common ground upon which all agree may be stated thus: All\r\n     males having certain qualifications are in reason and in law\r\n     entitled to vote. These qualifications affect either the body or\r\n     the mind or both. The first is the attainment of a certain age.\r\n     The age in itself is not material, but maturity of mental\r\n     development is material, although soundness of body in itself is\r\n     not essential, and want of it never works forfeiture of the\r\n     right. Age as a qualification for suffrage is by no means to be\r\n     confounded with age as a qualification for service in war.\r\n     Society has well established the distinction, and also that one\r\n     has no relation whatever to the other--the one having reference\r\n     to physical prowess, while the other relates only to the mental\r\n     state. This is shown by the ages fixed by law, that of eighteen\r\n     years as the commencement of the term of presumed fitness for\r\n     military service and forty-five as the period of its termination;\r\n     while the age of presumed fitness for the suffrage, which\r\n     requires no physical superiority certainly, is set at twenty-one\r\n     years when still greater strength of body has been attained than\r\n     at the period when liability to the dangers and hardships of war\r\n     begins. There are at least three million more male voters in our\r\n     country than of the population liable by law to the performance\r\n     of military duty. It is still further to be observed that the\r\n     right of suffrage continues as long as the mind lasts, while\r\n     ordinary liability to military service ceases at a period when\r\n     the physical powers, though still strong, are beginning to wane.\r\n     The truth is that there is no legal or natural connection between\r\n     the liability to fight and the right to vote.\r\n\r\n     The right to fight may be exercised voluntarily, or the liability\r\n     to fight may be enforced by the community, whenever there is need\r\n     for it, and the extent to which the physical forces of society\r\n     may be called upon in self-defense or in justifiable revolution\r\n     is measured not by age or sex, but by necessity, which may go so\r\n     far as to call into the field old men and women and the last\r\n     vestige of physical force. It can not be claimed that woman has\r\n     no right to vote because she is not liable to fight, for she is\r\n     so liable, and the freest government on the face of the earth has\r\n     the reserved power under the call of necessity to place her in\r\n     the forefront of the battle itself; and more than this, woman has\r\n     the right, and often has exercised it, to go there. If any one\r\n     could question the existence of this reserved power to call woman\r\n     to the common defense, either in the hospital or the field, it\r\n     would be woman herself, who has been deprived of participation in\r\n     the Government and in shaping public policies which have resulted\r\n     in dire emergency to the State. But in all times, and under all\r\n     forms of government and of social existence, woman has given her\r\n     body and her soul to the common defense.\r\n\r\n     The qualification of age, then, is imposed for the purpose of\r\n     securing mental and moral fitness for the suffrage on the part of\r\n     those who exercise it. It has no relation to the possession of\r\n     physical powers at all.\r\n\r\n     The property qualification for suffrage is, to my mind, an\r\n     invasion of natural right, which elevates mere property to an\r\n     equality with life and personal liberty, and it ought never to be\r\n     imposed. But, however that may be, its application has no\r\n     relation to sex, and its only object is to secure the exercise of\r\n     the suffrage under a stronger sense of obligation and\r\n     responsibility. The same is true of the qualifications of sanity,\r\n     education and obedience to the laws, which exclude dementia,\r\n     ignorance and crime from participation in the sovereignty. Every\r\n     condition or qualification imposed upon the exercise of the\r\n     suffrage, save sex alone, has for its only object or possible\r\n     justification the possession of mental and moral fitness, and has\r\n     no relation to physical power.\r\n\r\n     The question then arises why is the qualification of masculinity\r\n     required? The distinction between human beings by reason of sex\r\n     is a physical distinction. The soul is of no sex. If there be a\r\n     distinction of soul by reason of the physical difference, woman\r\n     is the superior of man. In proof of this see the minority report\r\n     of this committee with all the eulogiums of woman pronounced by\r\n     those who, like the serpent of old, would flatter her vanity that\r\n     they may continue to wield her power. I repeat that the soul is\r\n     of no sex, and that so far as the possession and exercise of\r\n     human rights and powers are concerned, sex is but a physical\r\n     property, whose possession renders the female just as important\r\n     as the male, and in just as great need of power in the government\r\n     of society. If there be a difference, however, her average\r\n     physical inferiority is really compensated for by a superior\r\n     mental and moral fitness to give direction to the course of\r\n     society and to the policy of the State. If, then, there be a\r\n     distinction between the souls of human beings resulting from sex,\r\n     woman is better fitted for the exercise of the suffrage than man.\r\n\r\n     It is asserted by some that the suffrage is an inherent natural\r\n     right, and by others that it is merely a privilege extended to\r\n     the individual by society at its discretion. However this may be,\r\n     its extension to any class must come through the exercise of the\r\n     suffrage by those who already possess it. Therefore, the appeal\r\n     by those who have it not must be made to those who are asked to\r\n     part with a portion of their own power. It is only human nature\r\n     that the male sex should hesitate to yield one-half of its power\r\n     to those whose cause, however strong in reason and justice, lacks\r\n     that physical force by which so largely the masses of men\r\n     themselves have wrung their own rights from rulers and kings.\r\n\r\n     It is not strange that when overwhelmed with argument and half\r\n     won by appeals to his better nature, and ashamed to refuse\r\n     blankly that which he finds no reason for longer withholding, man\r\n     avoids the dilemma by a pretended elevation of woman to a higher\r\n     sphere, where, as an angel, she has certain gauzy, ethereal\r\n     resources and superior attributes and functions which render the\r\n     possession of mere earthly, every-day powers and privileges\r\n     non-essential to her, however mere mortal men may find them\r\n     indispensable to their own freedom and happiness. But to the\r\n     denial of her right to vote, whether that denial be the blunt\r\n     refusal of the ignorant or the polished evasion of the refined\r\n     courtier and politician, woman can oppose only her most solemn\r\n     and perpetual appeal to the reason of man and to the justice of\r\n     Almighty God. She must continually point out the nature and\r\n     object of the suffrage and the necessity that she possess it for\r\n     her own and the public good.\r\n\r\n     What, then, is the suffrage, and why is it necessary that woman\r\n     should possess and exercise this function of freemen? I quote\r\n     briefly from the majority report of the Senate Committee:[33]\r\n\r\n     \"The rights for the maintenance of which human governments are\r\n     constituted are life, liberty and property. These rights are\r\n     common to men and women alike and both are entitled to the\r\n     sovereign power to protect these rights. This right to the\r\n     protection of rights appertains to the individual, not to the\r\n     family, or to any form of association, whether social or\r\n     corporate. Probably not more than five-eighths of the men of\r\n     legal age, qualified to vote, are heads of families, and not more\r\n     than that proportion of adult women are united with men in the\r\n     legal merger of married life. It is, therefore, quite incorrect\r\n     to speak of the State as an aggregate of families duly\r\n     represented at the ballot-box by their male head. The relation\r\n     between the government and the individual is direct; all rights\r\n     are individual rights, all duties are individual duties.\r\n\r\n     \"Government in its two highest functions is legislative and\r\n     judicial. By these powers the sovereignty prescribes the law and\r\n     directs its application to the vindication of rights and the\r\n     redress of wrongs. Conscience and intelligence are the only\r\n     forces which enter into the exercise of these primary and highest\r\n     functions of government. The remaining department is the\r\n     executive or administrative, and in all forms of government the\r\n     primary element of administration is force, but even in this\r\n     department conscience and intelligence are indispensable to its\r\n     direction.\r\n\r\n     \"If, now, we are to decide who of our sixty millions of human\r\n     beings are, by virtue of their qualifications, to be the\r\n     law-making power, by what tests shall the selection be\r\n     determined? The suffrage is this great primary law-making power.\r\n     It is not the executive power. It is not founded upon force.\r\n     Never in the history of this or any other genuine republic has\r\n     the law-making power, whether in general elections or in the\r\n     framing of laws in legislative assemblies, been vested in\r\n     individuals by reason of their physical powers....\r\n\r\n     \"The executive power of itself is a mere physical\r\n     instrumentality--an animal quality--and it is confided from\r\n     necessity to those who possess that quality, but always with\r\n     danger, except so far as wisdom and virtue control its exercise.\r\n     Therefore it is obvious that the greater the spiritual forces,\r\n     whether found in those who execute the law, or in the large body\r\n     by whom the suffrage is exercised, and who direct its execution,\r\n     the greater will be the safety and the surer will be the\r\n     happiness of the State.\r\n\r\n     \"It is too late to question the intellectual and moral capacity\r\n     of woman to understand political issues and intelligently decide\r\n     them at the polls. Indeed the pretense is no longer advanced that\r\n     woman should not vote because of her mental or moral unfitness to\r\n     perform this legislative function; but the suffrage is denied to\r\n     her because she can neither hang criminals, suppress mobs nor\r\n     handle the enginery of war. We have already seen the untenable\r\n     nature of this assumption, because those who make it bestow the\r\n     suffrage upon very large classes of men who, however well\r\n     qualified they may be to vote, are physically unable to perform\r\n     any of the duties which appertain to the execution of the law and\r\n     the defense of the State. Scarcely a Senator on this floor is\r\n     liable by law to perform military or other administrative duty,\r\n     yet this rule set up against the right of women to vote would\r\n     disfranchise nearly this whole body.\r\n\r\n     \"But it is unnecessary to grant that woman can not fight. History\r\n     is full of examples of her heroism in danger, of her endurance\r\n     and fortitude in trial, of her indispensable and supreme service\r\n     in hospital and field.... It is hardly worth while to consider\r\n     this trivial objection--that she is incompetent for purposes of\r\n     national murder or of bloody self-defense--as the basis for\r\n     denying a fundamental right, when we consider that if this right\r\n     were given to her she would by its very exercise almost certainly\r\n     abolish this great crime of the nations, which has always\r\n     inflicted upon woman the chief burden of woe.\"\r\n\r\nMr. Blair then demonstrated the intellectual ability of the woman of\r\nthe present day, proving in this respect her capacity and fitness to\r\nvote. He quoted from the minority report of the Senate Committee,\r\nwhich had been submitted by Senators Brown and Cockrell, saying:\r\n\r\n     It proceeds to show that both man and woman are designed for a\r\n     higher final estate--to-wit, that of matrimony. It seems to be\r\n     conceded that man is just as well fitted for matrimony as woman\r\n     herself, and the whole subject is illuminated with certain\r\n     botanical lore about stamens and pistils, which, however relevant\r\n     to matrimony, does not prove that woman should not vote unless at\r\n     the same time it proves that man should not vote. And certainly\r\n     it can not apply to those women, any more than to those men,\r\n     whose highest and final estate never is merged in the family\r\n     relation at all....\r\n\r\n     The right to vote is the great primitive right in which all\r\n     freedom originates and culminates. It is the right from which all\r\n     others spring, in which they merge, and without which they fall\r\n     whenever assailed. This right makes all the difference between\r\n     government by and with the consent of the governed, and\r\n     government without and against the consent of the governed; and\r\n     that is the difference between freedom and slavery. If the right\r\n     to vote be not that difference, what is? If either sex as a class\r\n     can dispense with the right to vote, then take it from the\r\n     strong and do not longer rob the weak of their defense for the\r\n     benefit of the strong. But it is impossible to conceive of the\r\n     suffrage as a right dependent at all upon such an irrelevant\r\n     condition as sex. It is an individual, a personal right, and if\r\n     withheld by reason of sex it is a moral robbery.\r\n\r\n     It is said that the duties of maternity disqualify for the\r\n     performance of the act of voting. It can not be, and I think is\r\n     not claimed by any one, that the mother who otherwise would be\r\n     fit to vote is rendered mentally or morally less fit to exercise\r\n     this high function in the State because of motherhood. On the\r\n     contrary, if any woman has a motive more than another person, man\r\n     or woman, to secure the enactment and enforcement of good laws,\r\n     it is the mother, who, besides her own life, person and\r\n     property--to the protection of which the ballot is as essential\r\n     as to those of man--has her little contingent of immortal beings\r\n     to conduct safely to the portals of active life through all the\r\n     snares and pitfalls woven around them by bad men and bad laws,\r\n     and to prepare rightly for the discharge of all the duties of\r\n     their day and generation, including, if boys, the exercise of the\r\n     very right denied to their mother.\r\n\r\n     Certainly if but for motherhood woman should vote, then ten\r\n     thousand times more necessary is it that the mother should be\r\n     armed with this great social and political power for the sake of\r\n     all men and women who are yet to be. It is said that she has not\r\n     the time. Let us see. By the best deductions I can make from the\r\n     census and from other sources, of the women of voting age in this\r\n     country not more than one-half are married and still liable to\r\n     the duties of maternity; for it will be remembered that a\r\n     considerable proportion of the mothers at any given time are\r\n     below the voting age, while another large proportion have passed\r\n     beyond the point of this objection. Then why disfranchise the\r\n     half to whom your objection, even if valid as to any, does not\r\n     apply at all; and most of these, too, the most mature and\r\n     therefore the best qualified to vote of any of their sex?\r\n\r\n     But how much is there of this objection of want of time or\r\n     physical strength to vote in its application to those women who\r\n     are bearing and training the coming millions?... The average\r\n     mother will attend church at least forty times yearly from her\r\n     cradle to her grave; and there is, besides, an infinity of other\r\n     social, religious and industrial obligations which she performs\r\n     because she is a married woman and a mother rather than for any\r\n     other reason whatever. Yet it is proposed to deprive all women\r\n     alike of an inestimable privilege for the reason that on any\r\n     given day of election perhaps one woman in twenty of voting age\r\n     may not be able to reach the polls....\r\n\r\n     When one thinks of the innumerable and trifling causes which keep\r\n     many of the best of men and the strongest opponents of woman\r\n     suffrage from the polls upon important occasions, it is difficult\r\n     to be tolerant of the objection that woman by reason of\r\n     motherhood has no time to vote....\r\n\r\n     It is urged that woman does not desire the privilege. If the\r\n     right exist at all it is an individual right, and not one which\r\n     belongs to a class or to the sex as such. Yet men tell us that\r\n     they will vote to give the suffrage to women whenever the\r\n     majority of women desire it. What would we say if it were\r\n     seriously proposed to recall the suffrage from all colored or\r\n     from all white men because a majority of either class should\r\n     decline or for any cause fail to vote? If one or many choose not\r\n     to claim their right it is no argument for depriving me of mine\r\n     or one woman of hers. There are many reasons why some women\r\n     declare themselves opposed to the extension of suffrage to their\r\n     sex. Some well-fed and pampered, without serious experiences in\r\n     life, are incapable of comprehending the subject at all. Vast\r\n     numbers, who secretly and earnestly desire it, from the long\r\n     habit of deference to the wishes of the other sex upon whom they\r\n     are so entirely dependent, and knowing the hostility of their\r\n     \"protectors\" to it, conceal their real sentiments. The \"lord\" of\r\n     the family referring this question to his wife, who has heard him\r\n     sneer or worse than sneer at suffragists for half a lifetime,\r\n     ought not expect an answer which she knows will subject her to\r\n     his censure and ridicule. It is like the old appeal of the master\r\n     to his slave to know if he would like to be free. Full well did\r\n     the wise and wary slave know that happiness depended upon\r\n     declaring contentment with his lot....\r\n\r\n     We are told that husband and wife will disagree and thus the\r\n     suffrage will destroy the family and ruin society. If a married\r\n     couple will quarrel at all, they will find the occasion, and it\r\n     would be fortunate indeed if their contention might concern\r\n     important affairs. There is no peace in the family save where\r\n     love is, and the same spirit which enables husband and wife to\r\n     enforce the toleration act between themselves in religious\r\n     matters will keep the peace between them in political\r\n     discussions. At all events this argument is unworthy of notice\r\n     unless we are to push it to its logical conclusion, and, for the\r\n     sake of peace in the family, to prohibit woman absolutely the\r\n     exercise of free speech and action. Men live with their\r\n     countrymen and yet disagree with them in politics, religion and\r\n     ten thousand of the affairs of life, as often the trifling as the\r\n     important. What harm, then, if woman be allowed her thought and\r\n     vote upon the tariff, education, temperance, peace, war, and\r\n     whatsoever else the suffrage decides.\r\n\r\n     We are told that no government of which we have authentic history\r\n     ever gave to women a share in the sovereignty. This is not true,\r\n     for the annals of monarchies and despotisms have been rendered\r\n     illustrious by queens of surpassing brilliance and power. But\r\n     even if it be true that no nation ever enfranchised woman--even\r\n     so until within one hundred years universal or even general\r\n     suffrage was unknown among men.\r\n\r\n     Has the millennium yet dawned? Is all progress at an end? If that\r\n     which is should therefore remain, why abolish the slavery of men?\r\n\r\n     We are informed that woman does not vote when she has the\r\n     opportunity. Wherever she has the unrestricted right she\r\n     exercises it. The records of Wyoming and Washington demonstrate\r\n     this fact.\r\n\r\nMr. Blair then quoted the statistics embodied in the report of the\r\ncommittee, showing the slow but sure progress of the enfranchisement\r\nof women, and concluded:\r\n\r\n     It is sometimes urged against this movement for the submission of\r\n     a resolution for a National Constitutional Amendment that women\r\n     should go to the States and fight it out there. But we did not\r\n     send the colored man to the States. No other amendment touching\r\n     the general national interest has been left to be fought out by\r\n     individual action in the separate States....\r\n\r\n     We only ask for woman an opportunity to bring her suit in the\r\n     great court for the amendment of fundamental law. It is\r\n     impossible for any right mind to escape the impression of solemn\r\n     responsibility which attaches to our decision. Ridicule and wit\r\n     of whatever quality are here as much out of place as in the\r\n     debates upon the Declaration of Independence. We are affirming or\r\n     denying the right of petition which by all law belongs as much to\r\n     women as to men....\r\n\r\n     Let us by our action to-day indorse, if we do not initiate, a\r\n     movement which, in the development of our race, shall guarantee\r\n     liberty to all without distinction of sex, even as our glorious\r\n     Constitution already grants the suffrage to every male citizen\r\n     without distinction of color or race.\r\n\r\nAs Senator Brown was absent, Senator Cockrell objected to a\r\nconsideration of the resolution and it was postponed. The minority\r\nreport of the Select Committee on Woman Suffrage signed by these two\r\nSenators consisted wholly of extracts from a series of anonymous\r\narticles which had appeared in the Chicago _Tribune_, entitled\r\n\"Letters from a Chimney-Corner.\"\r\n\r\nOn January 25, 1887, Senator Blair again called up his resolution and\r\na spirited debate followed. Senators Joseph E. Brown (Ga.) and George\r\nG. Vest (Mo.) represented the negative; Henry W. Blair (N. H.) and\r\nJoseph N. Dolph (Ore.) the affirmative. Senator Brown opened the\r\ndiscussion by presenting, word for word, the report signed by Senator\r\nFrancis M. Cockrell (Mo.) and himself in 1884. It embodied the stock\r\nobjections to woman suffrage, practically all in fact which are ever\r\nmade, and was in part as follows:[34]\r\n\r\n     Mr. President, the joint resolution introduced by my friend, the\r\n     Senator from New Hampshire, proposing an amendment to the\r\n     Constitution of the United States, conferring the right to vote\r\n     upon the women of the United States, is one of paramount\r\n     importance, as it involves great questions far-reaching in their\r\n     tendency, which seriously affect the very pillars of our social\r\n     fabric, which involve the peace and harmony of society, the unity\r\n     of the family, and much of the future success of our\r\n     Government....\r\n\r\n     I believe that the Creator intended that the sphere of the males\r\n     and females of our race should be different, and that their\r\n     duties and obligations, while they differ materially, are equally\r\n     important and equally honorable, and that each sex is equally\r\n     well qualified by natural endowments for the discharge of the\r\n     important duties which pertain to each, and that each sex is\r\n     equally competent to discharge those duties.\r\n\r\n     We find an abundance of evidence, both _in the works of nature_\r\n     and in the Divine revelation, to establish the fact that the\r\n     family properly regulated is the foundation and pillar of\r\n     society, and is the most important of any other human\r\n     institution. In the Divine economy it is provided that the man\r\n     shall be the head of the family, and shall take upon himself the\r\n     solemn obligation of providing for and protecting the family.\r\n\r\n     Man, by reason of his physical strength, and his other endowments\r\n     and faculties, is qualified for the discharge of those duties\r\n     that require strength and ability to combat with the sterner\r\n     realities and difficulties of life. It is not only his duty to\r\n     provide for and protect the family, but as a member of the\r\n     community it is also his duty to discharge the laborious and\r\n     responsible obligations which the family owe to the State, and\r\n     which obligations must be discharged by the head of the family,\r\n     until the male members have grown up to manhood and are able to\r\n     aid in the discharge of those obligations, when it becomes their\r\n     duty each in turn to take charge of and rear a family, for which\r\n     he is responsible.\r\n\r\n     Among other duties which the head of the family owes to the State\r\n     is military duty in time of war, which he, _when able-bodied_, is\r\n     able to discharge and which the female members of the family are\r\n     unable to discharge.[35]\r\n\r\n     He is also under obligation to discharge jury duty,[36] and by\r\n     himself _or his representatives_ to perform his part of the labor\r\n     necessary to construct and keep in order roads, bridges, streets\r\n     and all grades of public highways.[37] And in this progressive\r\n     age upon the male sex is devolved the duty of constructing and\r\n     operating our railroads, and the engines and other rolling stock\r\n     with which they are operated; of building, equipping and\r\n     launching shipping and other water craft of every character\r\n     necessary for the transportation of passengers and freight upon\r\n     our rivers, our lakes, and upon the high seas.\r\n\r\n     The labor in our fields, sowing, cultivating and reaping crops\r\n     must be discharged _mainly_ by the male sex, as the female sex,\r\n     for want of physical strength, are generally unable to discharge\r\n     these duties. As it is the duty of the male sex to perform the\r\n     obligations to the State, to society and to the family, already\r\n     mentioned, with numerous others that might be enumerated, it is\r\n     also their duty to aid in the government of the State, which is\r\n     simply a great aggregation of families.[38] Society can not be\r\n     preserved nor can the people be prosperous without good\r\n     government. The government of our country is a government _of the\r\n     people_, and it becomes necessary that the _class_ of people upon\r\n     whom the responsibility rests should assemble together and\r\n     consider and discuss the great questions of governmental policy\r\n     which from time to time are presented for their decision.\r\n\r\n     This often requires the assembling of caucuses in the night time,\r\n     as well as public assemblages in the daytime. It is a _laborious\r\n     task_, for which the male sex is infinitely better fitted than\r\n     the female sex; and after proper consideration and discussion of\r\n     the measures that may divide the country from time to time, the\r\n     duty devolves upon those who are responsible for the government,\r\n     at times and places to be fixed by law, to meet and by ballot to\r\n     decide the great questions of government upon which the\r\n     prosperity of the country depends.\r\n\r\n     These are some of the _active and sterner duties_ of life to\r\n     which the male sex is by nature better fitted than the female\r\n     sex. If in carrying out the policy of the State on great measures\r\n     adjudged vital such policy should lead to war, either foreign or\r\n     domestic, it would seem to follow very naturally that those who\r\n     have been responsible for the management of the State should be\r\n     the parties to take the hazards and hardships of the\r\n     struggle.[39] Here again man is better fitted by nature for the\r\n     discharge of the duty--woman is unfit for it.\r\n\r\n     On the other hand, the Creator has assigned to woman very\r\n     laborious and responsible duties, _by no means less important_\r\n     than those imposed upon the male sex, though entirely different\r\n     in their character.[40] In the family she is a _queen_. She alone\r\n     is fitted for the discharge of the sacred trust of wife and the\r\n     endearing relation of mother. While the man is contending with\r\n     the sterner duties of life, _the whole time_ of the noble,\r\n     affectionate and true woman is required in the discharge of the\r\n     delicate and difficult duties assigned her in the family circle,\r\n     in her church relations and in the society where her lot is cast.\r\n     When the husband returns home weary and worn in the discharge of\r\n     the difficult and laborious tasks assigned him, he finds in the\r\n     good wife solace and consolation which is nowhere else afforded.\r\n\r\n     But a still more important duty devolves upon the mother. After\r\n     having brought into existence the offspring of the nuptial union,\r\n     the children are dependent upon the mother _as they are not upon\r\n     any other human being_. The trust is a most sacred, most\r\n     responsible and most important one. She molds the character. She\r\n     educates the heart as well as the intellect, and she prepares the\r\n     future man, now the boy, for honor or dishonor. Upon the manner\r\n     in which she discharges her duty depends the fact whether he\r\n     shall in future be a useful citizen or a burden to society. She\r\n     inculcates lessons of patriotism, manliness, religion and virtue,\r\n     _fitting the man by reason of his training_ to be an ornament to\r\n     society, or dooming him by her neglect to a life of dishonor and\r\n     shame. Society acts unwisely, when it imposes upon her the duties\r\n     that by common consent have always been assigned to the stronger\r\n     and sterner sex, and the discharge of which causes her to neglect\r\n     those sacred and all-important duties to her children and to the\r\n     society of which they are members.[41]\r\n\r\n     In the church, by her piety, her charity and her Christian\r\n     purity, she not only aids society by a proper training of her own\r\n     children, but the children of others, whom she encourages to come\r\n     to the sacred altar. In the Sunday-school room the good woman is\r\n     a _princess_ and she exerts an influence which purifies and\r\n     ennobles society. In the sick room and among the humble, the poor\r\n     and the suffering the good woman is an _angel_ of light....\r\n\r\n     If the wife and the mother is required to leave the sacred\r\n     precincts of home and to attempt to do military duty when the\r\n     State is in peril; or if she is to be required to leave her home\r\n     from day to day in attendance upon the court as a juror, and to\r\n     be shut up in the jury room from night to night with men who are\r\n     strangers, while a question of life or property is being\r\n     discussed; if she is to attend political meetings, take part in\r\n     political discussions and mingle with the male sex at political\r\n     gatherings; if she is to become an active politician; if she is\r\n     to attend political caucuses at late hours of the night; if she\r\n     is to take part in all the unsavory work that may be deemed\r\n     necessary for the triumph of her party; and if on election day\r\n     she is to leave her home and go upon the streets electioneering\r\n     for votes for the candidates who receive her support, and\r\n     mingling among the crowds of men who gather round the polls, she\r\n     is to press her way through them to the precinct and deposit her\r\n     ballot; if she is to take part in the corporate struggles of the\r\n     city or town in which she resides, attend to the duties of his\r\n     honor, the mayor, the councilman, or of policeman, to say nothing\r\n     of the many other like obligations which are disagreeable (!)\r\n     even to the male sex, how is she, with all these heavy duties of\r\n     citizen, politician and officeholder resting upon her shoulders,\r\n     to attend to the more sacred, delicate, refining trust to which\r\n     we have already referred, and for which she is peculiarly fitted\r\n     by nature? Who is to care for and train the children while she\r\n     is absent in the discharge of these masculine duties?[42]\r\n\r\n     But it has been said that the present law is unjust to woman;\r\n     that she is _often_ required to pay tax on the property she holds\r\n     without being permitted to take part in framing or administering\r\n     the laws by which her property is governed, and that she is taxed\r\n     without representation. _That is a great mistake._ It may be very\r\n     doubtful whether the male or female sex in the present state of\r\n     things has more influence in the administration of the affairs of\r\n     the government and the enactment of the laws by which we are\r\n     governed.[43]\r\n\r\n     While the woman does not discharge military duty, nor does she\r\n     attend courts and serve on juries, nor does she labor on the\r\n     public streets, bridges or highways, nor does she engage actively\r\n     and publicly in the discussion of political affairs, nor does she\r\n     enter the _crowded precincts of the ballot-box_ to deposit her\r\n     suffrage, still the intelligent, cultivated, noble woman is a\r\n     power behind the throne. All her influence is in favor of\r\n     morality, justice and fair dealing, all her efforts and her\r\n     counsel are in favor of good government, wise and wholesome\r\n     regulations and a faithful administration of the laws.[44] ...\r\n\r\n     It would be a gratification, and we are always glad to see the\r\n     ladies gratified, to many who have espoused the cause of woman\r\n     suffrage if they could take active part in political affairs and\r\n     go to the polls and cast their votes alongside the male sex; but\r\n     while this would be a gratification to a large number of very\r\n     worthy and excellent ladies who take a different view of the\r\n     question from that which we entertain, we feel that it would be a\r\n     great cruelty to a much larger number of the cultivated, refined,\r\n     delicate and lovely women of this country who seek no such\r\n     distinction, who would enjoy no such privilege, who would with\r\n     womanlike delicacy shrink from the discharge of any such\r\n     obligation, and who would sincerely regret that what they\r\n     consider the folly of the State had imposed upon them any such\r\n     unpleasant duties. But should female suffrage be once established\r\n     it would become an imperative necessity that the very large\r\n     class, indeed much the largest class, of the women of this\r\n     country of the character last described should yield, contrary to\r\n     their inclinations and wishes, to the necessity which would\r\n     compel them to engage in political strife.\r\n\r\n     We apprehend no one who has properly considered this question\r\n     will doubt, if female suffrage should be established, that the\r\n     more ignorant and less refined portions of the female population,\r\n     to say nothing of the baser class of females, laying aside\r\n     feminine delicacy and disregarding the sacred duties devolving\r\n     upon them, to which we have already referred, would rush to the\r\n     polls and take pleasure in the crowded association which the\r\n     situation would compel, of the two sexes in political meetings\r\n     and at the ballot-box....\r\n\r\n     It is now a problem which perplexes the brain of the ablest\r\n     statesmen to determine how we will best preserve our republican\r\n     system as against the demoralizing influence of the large class\r\n     of our present citizens and voters who by reason of their\r\n     illiteracy are unable to read or write the ballot they cast. If\r\n     our colored population, who were so recently slaves that even the\r\n     males who are voters have had but little opportunity to educate\r\n     themselves or to be educated, whose ignorance is now exciting the\r\n     liveliest interest of our statesmen, are causes of serious\r\n     apprehension, what is to be said in favor of adding to the voting\r\n     population all the females of that race, who, on account of the\r\n     situation in which they have been placed, have had much less\r\n     opportunity to be educated than even the males of their own\r\n     race?[45]\r\n\r\n     It may be said that their votes could be offset by the ballots of\r\n     the educated and refined ladies of the white race in the same\r\n     section; but who does not know that the ignorant female voters\r\n     would be at the polls _en masse_, while the refined and educated,\r\n     shrinking from public contact on such occasions, would remain at\r\n     home and attend to their domestic and other important duties?[46]\r\n     Are we ready to expose the country to the demoralization, and our\r\n     institutions to the strain, which would be placed upon them, for\r\n     the gratification of a minority of the virtuous and good of our\r\n     female population at the expense of the mortification of a very\r\n     large majority of the same sex?\r\n\r\n     It has been frequently urged that the ballot is necessary to\r\n     women to enable them to protect themselves in securing\r\n     occupations, and to enable them to realize the same compensation\r\n     for the like labor which is received by men. This argument is\r\n     plausible, but upon a closer examination it will be found to\r\n     possess but little real force. The price of labor is and must\r\n     continue to be governed by the law of supply and demand, and the\r\n     person who has the most physical strength to labor, and the most\r\n     pursuits requiring such strength open for employment, will always\r\n     command the higher prices.\r\n\r\n     Ladies make excellent teachers in public schools; many of them\r\n     are every way the equals of their male competitors, and still\r\n     they secure less wages than males. The reason is obvious. The\r\n     number of ladies who offer themselves as teachers is much larger\r\n     than the number of males who are willing to teach. The larger\r\n     number of females offer to teach _because other occupations are\r\n     not open to them_. The smaller number of males offer to teach\r\n     _because other more profitable occupations are open_ to most\r\n     males who are competent to teach....\r\n\r\n     The ballot can not impart to the female physical strength which\r\n     she does not possess, nor can it open to her pursuits which she\r\n     does not have physical ability to engage in; and as long as she\r\n     lacks the physical strength to compete with men in the different\r\n     departments of labor, there will be more competition in her\r\n     department, and she must necessarily receive less wages.[47]\r\n\r\n     But it is claimed again that females should have the ballot as a\r\n     protection against the tyranny of bad husbands. This is also\r\n     delusive. If the husband is brutal, arbitrary or tyrannical, and\r\n     tyrannizes over her at home, the ballot in her hands would be no\r\n     protection against such injustice, but the husband who compelled\r\n     her to conform to his wishes in other respects would also compel\r\n     her to use the ballot, if she possessed it, as he might please to\r\n     dictate. The ballot would, therefore, be of no assistance to the\r\n     wife in such case, nor could it heal family strifes or\r\n     dissensions. On the contrary, one of the gravest objections to\r\n     placing the ballot in the hands of the female sex is that it\r\n     would promote unhappiness and dissensions in the family circle.\r\n     There should be unity and harmony in the family.[48] ...\r\n\r\n     When woman becomes a voter she will be more or less of a\r\n     politician, and will form political alliances or unite with\r\n     political parties which will frequently be antagonistic to those\r\n     to which her husband belongs. This will introduce into the family\r\n     circle new elements of disagreement and discord which will\r\n     frequently end in unhappy divisions, if not in separation and\r\n     divorce. This must frequently occur when she becomes an active\r\n     politician, identified with a party which is distasteful to her\r\n     husband. On the other hand, if she unites with her husband in\r\n     party associations and votes with him on all occasions so as not\r\n     to disturb the harmony and happiness of the family, then the\r\n     ballot is of no service, as it simply _duplicates the vote of the\r\n     male_ on each side of the question and leaves the result the\r\n     same.[49] ...\r\n\r\n     It may be said, however, that there is a class of young ladies\r\n     who do not choose to marry, and who select professions or\r\n     avocations and follow them for a livelihood. This is true, but\r\n     this class, compared with the number who unite in matrimony with\r\n     the husbands of their choice, is comparatively very small, and it\r\n     is the duty of society to encourage the increase of marriages\r\n     rather than of celibacy. If the larger number of females select\r\n     pursuits or professions which require them to decline marriage,\r\n     society to that extent is deprived of the advantage resulting\r\n     from the increase of population by marriage.\r\n\r\n     It is said by those who have examined the question closely that\r\n     the largest number of divorces is now found in the communities\r\n     where the advocates of female suffrage are most numerous, and\r\n     where the _individuality_ of woman as related to her husband,\r\n     which such a doctrine inculcates, is increased to the greatest\r\n     extent.[50] ...\r\n\r\nSenator Brown then introduced a long quotation from the\r\n\"Chimney-Corner,\" covering so exactly the ground of his speech and in\r\nso nearly the same language as to suggest, if not collusion, at least\r\n\"two souls with but a single thought,\" which he thus emphasized in\r\nclosing:\r\n\r\n     The woman with the infant at the breast is in no condition to\r\n     plow on the farm, labor hard in the workshop, discharge the\r\n     duties of a juryman, conduct cases as an advocate in court,\r\n     preside in important cases as a judge, command armies as a\r\n     general, or bear arms as a private. These duties, and others of\r\n     like character, belong to the male sex; while the more important\r\n     duties of home, to which I have already referred, devolve upon\r\n     the female sex. We can neither reverse the physical nor the moral\r\n     laws of our nature, and as this movement is an attempt to reverse\r\n     these laws, and to devolve upon the female sex important and\r\n     laborious duties for which they are not by nature physically\r\n     competent, I am not prepared to support this bill.\r\n\r\nHe was followed by Senator Dolph, who said:\r\n\r\n     Mr. President, I shall not detain the Senate long. I do not feel\r\n     satisfied, when a measure so important to the people of this\r\n     country and to humanity is about to be submitted to a vote of the\r\n     Senate, to remain wholly silent.\r\n\r\n     Fortunately for the perpetuity of our institutions and the\r\n     prosperity of the people, the Federal Constitution contains a\r\n     provision for its own amendment. The framers of that instrument\r\n     foresaw that time and experience, the growth of the country and\r\n     the consequent expansion of the Government, would develop the\r\n     necessity for changes in it. Under this provision, at the first\r\n     session of the First Congress, ten amendments were submitted to\r\n     the Legislatures of the several States, in due time ratified by\r\n     the constitutional number, and thus became a part of the\r\n     Constitution. Since then there have been added to the\r\n     Constitution by the same process five different articles. To\r\n     secure an amendment requires the concurrent action of two-thirds\r\n     of both branches of Congress and the affirmative action of\r\n     three-fourths of the States. The question as to whether this\r\n     resolution shall be submitted to the Legislatures for\r\n     ratification does not involve the right or policy of the proposed\r\n     amendment....\r\n\r\n     No question in this country has been more ably discussed than\r\n     this has been by the women themselves. I do not think a single\r\n     objection which is made to woman suffrage is tenable. No one will\r\n     contend but that women have sufficient capacity to vote\r\n     intelligently. Sacred and profane history is full of the records\r\n     of great deeds by women. They have ruled kingdoms, and, my friend\r\n     from Georgia to the contrary notwithstanding, they have commanded\r\n     armies. They have excelled in statecraft, they have shone in\r\n     literature, and, rising superior to their environments and\r\n     breaking the shackles with which custom and tyranny have bound\r\n     them, they have stood side by side with men in the fields of the\r\n     arts and the sciences.\r\n\r\n     If it were a fact that woman is intellectually inferior to man,\r\n     which I do not admit, still that would be no reason why she\r\n     should not be permitted to participate in the formation and\r\n     control of the government to which she owes allegiance. If we are\r\n     to have as a test for the exercise of the right of suffrage a\r\n     qualification based upon intelligence, let it be applied to women\r\n     and to men alike. If it be admitted that suffrage is a right,\r\n     that is the end of controversy; there can no longer be any\r\n     argument made against woman suffrage; because, if it is her\r\n     right, then, if there were but one poor woman in all the United\r\n     States demanding the right it would be tyranny to refuse the\r\n     demand.\r\n\r\n     But our opponents say that suffrage is not a right; that it is a\r\n     matter of grace only; that it is a privilege which is conferred\r\n     upon or withheld from individual members of society by society at\r\n     pleasure. Society as here used means man's government, and the\r\n     proposition assumes that men have a right to institute and\r\n     control governments for themselves and for women. I admit that in\r\n     the governments of the world, past and present, men as a rule\r\n     have assumed to be the ruling class; that they have instituted\r\n     governments from participation in which they have excluded women;\r\n     that they have made laws for themselves and for women, and have\r\n     themselves administered them. But, that the provisions conferring\r\n     or regulating suffrage, in the constitutions and laws of\r\n     governments so constituted, have determined the question of the\r\n     _right_ of suffrage, can not be maintained.\r\n\r\n     Let us suppose, if we can, a community separated from all\r\n     others--having no organized government, owing no allegiance to\r\n     any existing governments, without any knowledge of the character\r\n     of those present or past, so that when they come to form one for\r\n     themselves they can do so free from the bias or prejudice of\r\n     custom or education--a community composed of an equal number of\r\n     men and women, having equal property rights to be defined and to\r\n     be protected by law. When such community came to institute a\r\n     government--and it would have an undoubted right to institute one\r\n     for itself, and the instinct of self-preservation would soon lead\r\n     it to do so--will my friend from Georgia tell me by what right,\r\n     human or divine, the male portion could exclude the female\r\n     portion, equal in number and having equal property rights, from\r\n     participation in the formation of such government and in the\r\n     enactment of its laws? I understand that the Senator, if he\r\n     would answer, would say that he believes the author of our\r\n     existence, the ruler of the universe, has given different spheres\r\n     to man and woman. Admit that; and still neither in nature nor in\r\n     the revealed will of God do I find anything to lead me to believe\r\n     that the Creator did not intend that a woman should exercise the\r\n     right of self-government.\r\n\r\n     During the consideration by this body, at the last session, of\r\n     the bill to admit Washington Territory into the Union, referring\r\n     to the fact that in that Territory woman already had been\r\n     enfranchised, I briefly submitted my views on this subject, which\r\n     I now ask the Secretary to read.\r\n\r\n     The Secretary read as follows: \" ... I do not believe the\r\n     proposition so often asserted that suffrage is a political\r\n     privilege only, and not a natural right. It is regulated by the\r\n     constitution and laws of a State, I grant, but it needs no\r\n     argument to show that a constitution and laws adopted and enacted\r\n     by a fragment only of the whole body of the people, but binding\r\n     alike on all, are a usurpation of the powers of government.\r\n\r\n     \"Government is but organized society. Whatever its form, it has\r\n     its origin in the necessities of mankind and is indispensable for\r\n     the maintenance of civilized society. It is essential to every\r\n     government that it should represent the supreme power of the\r\n     State, and be capable of subjecting the will of its individual\r\n     citizens to its authority. Such a government can derive its just\r\n     powers only from the consent of the governed, and can be\r\n     established only under a fundamental law which is self-imposed.\r\n     Every person of suitable age and discretion who is to be subject\r\n     to such a government has, in my judgment, a natural right to\r\n     participate in its formation. It is a significant fact that,\r\n     should Congress pass this bill and authorize the people of\r\n     Washington Territory to frame a State constitution and organize a\r\n     State government, the fundamental law of the State would be made\r\n     by all the citizens who were to be subject to it, and not by\r\n     one-half of them. And we shall witness the spectacle of a State\r\n     government founded in accordance with the principles of equality,\r\n     and have a State at last with a truly republican form of\r\n     government.[51]\r\n\r\n     \"The fathers of the republic enunciated the doctrine 'that all\r\n     men are created equal; that they are endowed by their Creator\r\n     with certain inalienable rights; that among these are life,\r\n     liberty and the pursuit of happiness.' It is strange that any one\r\n     in this enlightened age should be found to contend that this\r\n     declaration is true only of men, and that a man is endowed by his\r\n     Creator with inalienable rights not possessed by a woman. The\r\n     lamented Lincoln immortalized the expression that ours is a\r\n     government 'of the people, by the people and for the people,' and\r\n     yet it is far from that. There can be no government by the people\r\n     where one-half of them are allowed no voice in its organization\r\n     and control. I regard the struggle going on in this country and\r\n     elsewhere for the enfranchisement of women as but a continuation\r\n     of the great struggle for human liberty which, from the earliest\r\n     dawn of authentic history, has convulsed nations, rent kingdoms\r\n     and drenched battlefields with human blood. I look upon the\r\n     victories which have been achieved in the cause of woman's\r\n     enfranchisement in Washington Territory and elsewhere, as the\r\n     crowning victories of all which have been won in the\r\n     long-continued, still-continuing contest between liberty and\r\n     oppression, and as destined to exert a greater influence upon the\r\n     human race than any achieved upon the battlefield in ancient or\r\n     modern times.\"\r\n\r\n     Mr. President, the movement for woman suffrage has passed the\r\n     stage of ridicule. The pending joint resolution may not pass\r\n     during this Congress, but the time is not far distant when in\r\n     every State of the Union and in every Territory women will be\r\n     admitted to an equal voice in the government, and that will be\r\n     done whether the Federal Constitution is amended or not....\r\n\r\n     No measure involving such radical changes in our institutions and\r\n     fraught with so great consequences to this country and to\r\n     humanity has made such progress as the movement for woman\r\n     suffrage. Denunciation will not much longer answer for arguments\r\n     by the opponents of this measure. The portrayal of the evils to\r\n     flow from woman suffrage such as we have heard pictured to-day by\r\n     the Senator from Georgia, the loss of harmony between husband and\r\n     wife and the consequent instability of the marriage relation, the\r\n     neglect of husbands and children by wives and mothers for the\r\n     performance of their political duties, in short the\r\n     incapacitating of women for wives and mothers and companions,\r\n     will not much longer serve to frighten the timid. Proof is better\r\n     than theory. The experiment has been made and the predicted evils\r\n     to flow from it have not followed. On the contrary, if we can\r\n     believe the almost universal testimony, wherever it has been\r\n     tried it has been followed by the most beneficial results.\r\n\r\n     In Washington Territory, since woman was enfranchised, there have\r\n     been two elections. At the first there were 8,368 votes cast by\r\n     women out of a total vote of about 34,000. At the second\r\n     election, which was held in November last, out of 48,000 votes,\r\n     12,000 were cast by women.\r\n\r\n     I desire also to inform my friend from Georgia that since women\r\n     were enfranchised in Washington Territory nature has continued in\r\n     her wonted course. The sun rises and sets; there are seed-time\r\n     and harvest; seasons come and go. The population has increased\r\n     with the usual regularity and rapidity. Marriages have been quite\r\n     as frequent and divorces have been no more so. Women have not\r\n     lost their influence for good upon society, but men have been\r\n     elevated and refined. If we are to believe the testimony which\r\n     comes from lawyers, physicians, ministers of the gospel,\r\n     merchants, mechanics, farmers and laboring men--the united\r\n     testimony of the entire people of the Territory--the results of\r\n     woman suffrage there have been all that could be desired by its\r\n     friends. Some of the results have been seen in its making the\r\n     polls quiet and orderly, awakening a new interest in educational\r\n     questions and those of moral reform, securing the passage of\r\n     beneficial laws and the proper enforcement of them, elevating\r\n     men, and doing so without injury to women.\r\n\r\nSenator James B. Eustis (La.) inquired whether, if the right of\r\nsuffrage were conferred, women ought to be required to serve on\r\njuries. To this Senator Dolph replied: \"I can answer that very\r\nreadily. It does not necessarily follow that because a woman is\r\npermitted to vote and thus have a voice in making the laws by which\r\nshe is to be governed and by which her property rights are to be\r\ndetermined, she must perform such duty as service upon a jury. But I\r\nwill inform the Senator that in Washington Territory she does serve\r\nupon juries, and with great satisfaction to the judges of the courts\r\nand to all parties who desire to see an honest and efficient\r\nadministration of law.\" The following colloquy then ensued:\r\n\r\n     MR. EUSTIS: I was aware of the fact that women are required to\r\n     serve on juries in Washington Territory because they are allowed\r\n     to vote. I understand that under all State laws those duties are\r\n     considered correlative. Now, I ask the Senator whether he thinks\r\n     it is a decent spectacle to take a mother away from her nursing\r\n     infant and lock her up all night to sit on a jury?\r\n\r\n     MR. DOLPH: I intended to say before I reached this point of being\r\n     interrogated that I not only do not believe that there is a\r\n     single argument against woman suffrage which is tenable, but also\r\n     that there is not a single one which is really worthy of any\r\n     serious consideration. The Senator from Louisiana is a lawyer,\r\n     and he knows very well that a mother with a nursing infant, that\r\n     fact being made known to the court, would be excused. He knows\r\n     himself, and he has seen it done a hundred times, that for\r\n     trivial excuses compared to that, men have been excused from\r\n     service on a jury.\r\n\r\n     MR. EUSTIS: I will ask the Senator whether he knows that under\r\n     the laws of Washington Territory this is a legal excuse from\r\n     serving on a jury?\r\n\r\n     MR. DOLPH: I am not prepared to state that it is; but there is no\r\n     question in the world but that any Judge, this fact being made\r\n     known, would excuse a woman from attendance upon a jury. No\r\n     special authority would be required. I will state further that I\r\n     have not learned that there has been any serious objection on the\r\n     part of any woman summoned for jury service in that Territory to\r\n     performing that duty. I have not learned that it has worked to\r\n     the disadvantage of any family, but I do know that the judges of\r\n     the courts have taken especial pains to commend the women who\r\n     have been called to serve upon juries for the manner in which\r\n     they have discharged their duty.\r\n\r\n     I wish to say further that there is no connection whatever\r\n     between jury service and the right of suffrage. The question as\r\n     to who shall perform jury service, who shall perform military\r\n     service, who shall perform civil official duty, is certainly a\r\n     matter to be regulated by the community itself; but the question\r\n     of the right to participate in the formation of a government\r\n     which controls the life, the property and the destinies of its\r\n     citizens, I contend is one which goes back of these mere\r\n     regulations for the protection of property and the punishment of\r\n     offenses under the laws. It is a matter of right which it is a\r\n     tyranny to refuse to any citizen demanding it.\r\n\r\n     Now, Mr. President, I shall close by saying, God speed the day\r\n     when not only in all the States of the Union and in all the\r\n     Territories, but everywhere, woman shall stand before the law\r\n     freed from the last shackle which has been riveted upon her by\r\n     tyranny and the last disability which has been imposed upon her\r\n     by ignorance--not only in respect to the right of suffrage but in\r\n     every other respect the peer and equal of her brother, man.\r\n\r\nSenator Vest then entered into a long and elaborate discussion of the\r\nresolution, in which he said:\r\n\r\n     Mr. President, any measure of legislation which affects popular\r\n     government based on _the will of the people as expressed through\r\n     their suffrage_ is not only important but vitally so. If this\r\n     government which is based on _the intelligence of the people_,\r\n     shall ever be destroyed it will be by injudicious, immature or\r\n     corrupt suffrage. If the Ship of State launched by our fathers\r\n     shall ever be destroyed, it will be by striking the rock of\r\n     universal, unprepared suffrage. Suffrage once given can never be\r\n     taken away. Legislatures and conventions may do everything else;\r\n     they never can do that. When any particular class or portion of\r\n     the community is once invested with this privilege _it is fixed,\r\n     accomplished and eternal_.[52]\r\n\r\n     The Senator who spoke last on this question refers to the\r\n     successful experiment in regard to woman suffrage in the\r\n     Territories of Wyoming and Washington. It is not upon the plains\r\n     of the sparsely-settled Territories of the West that woman\r\n     suffrage can be tested. Suffrage in the rural districts and\r\n     sparsely-settled regions of this country must from the very\r\n     nature of things remain pure when corrupt everywhere else. The\r\n     danger of corrupt suffrage is in the cities, and those masses of\r\n     population to which civilization tends everywhere in all history.\r\n     Wyoming Territory! Washington Territory! Where are their large\r\n     cities? Where are the localities in which the strain upon popular\r\n     government must come?\r\n\r\n     The Senator from New Hampshire, who is so conspicuous in this\r\n     movement, appalled the country some months since by his ghastly\r\n     array of illiteracy in the Southern States.... He proposes to\r\n     give the negro women of the South this right of suffrage, utterly\r\n     unprepared as they are for it. In a convention some\r\n     two-years-and-a-half ago in the city of Louisville an\r\n     intelligent negro from the South said the negro men could not\r\n     vote the Democratic ticket because the women would not live with\r\n     them if they did. The negro men go out in the hotels and upon the\r\n     railroad cars; they go to the cities and by attrition they wear\r\n     away the prejudice of race; but the women remain at home, and\r\n     their emotional natures aggregate and compound the\r\n     race-prejudice, and when suffrage is given them what must be the\r\n     result?\r\n\r\n     Mr. President, it is not my purpose to speak of the\r\n     inconveniences, for they are nothing more, of woman suffrage.[53]\r\n     I trust that as a gentleman I respect the feelings of the ladies\r\n     and their advocates. I am not here to ridicule. My purpose only\r\n     is to use legitimate argument as to a movement which commands\r\n     respectful consideration if for no other reason than because it\r\n     comes from women. But it is impossible to divest ourselves of a\r\n     certain degree of sentiment when considering this question. I\r\n     pity the man who can consider any question affecting the\r\n     influence of woman with the cold, dry logic of business. What man\r\n     can, without aversion, turn from the blessed memory of that dear\r\n     old grandmother, or the gentle words and caressing hand of that\r\n     blessed mother gone to the unknown world, to face in its stead\r\n     the idea of a female justice of the peace or township constable?\r\n     For my part I want when I go to my home--when I turn from the\r\n     arena where man contends with man for what we call the prizes of\r\n     this paltry world--I want to go back, not to be received in the\r\n     masculine embrace of some female ward politician, but to the\r\n     earnest, loving look and touch of a true woman. I want to go back\r\n     to the jurisdiction of the wife, the mother; and instead of a\r\n     lecture upon finance or the tariff or the construction of the\r\n     Constitution, I want those blessed, loving details of domestic\r\n     life and domestic love.\r\n\r\n     I have said I would not speak of the inconveniences to arise from\r\n     woman suffrage--when the mother is called upon to decide as a\r\n     juryman or jurywoman rights of property or rights of life, whilst\r\n     her baby is \"mewling and puking\" in solitary confinement at home.\r\n     There are other considerations more important, and one of them to\r\n     my mind is insuperable. I speak now respecting women as a sex. I\r\n     believe that they are better than men, but I do not believe they\r\n     are adapted to the political work of this world. I do not believe\r\n     that the Great Intelligence ever intended them to invade the\r\n     sphere of work given to men, tearing down and destroying all the\r\n     best influences for which God has intended them.\r\n\r\n     The great evil in this country to-day is in emotional suffrage.\r\n     The great danger to-day is in excitable suffrage. If the voters\r\n     of this country could think always coolly, and if they could\r\n     deliberate, if they could go by judgment and not by passion, our\r\n     institutions would survive forever, eternal as the foundations of\r\n     the continent itself; but massed together, subject to the\r\n     excitement of mobs and of these terrible political contests that\r\n     come upon us from year to year under the autonomy of our\r\n     government, what would be the result if suffrage were given to\r\n     the women of the United States?\r\n\r\n     Women are essentially emotional. It is no disparagement to them\r\n     they are so. It is no more insulting to say that women are\r\n     emotional than to say that they are delicately constructed\r\n     physically and unfitted to become soldiers or workmen under the\r\n     sterner, harder pursuits of life. What we want in this country is\r\n     to avoid emotional suffrage, and what we need is to put more\r\n     logic into public affairs and less feeling.[54]\r\n\r\n     There are spheres in which feeling should be paramount. There are\r\n     kingdoms in which the heart should reign supreme. That kingdom\r\n     belongs to woman, the realm of sentiment, the realm of love, the\r\n     realm of the gentler and holier and kindlier attributes that make\r\n     the name of wife, mother and sister next to that of God himself.\r\n\r\n     I would not, and I say it deliberately, degrade woman by giving\r\n     her the right of suffrage. I mean the word in its full\r\n     signification, because I believe that woman as she is today, the\r\n     queen of home and of hearts, is above the political collisions of\r\n     this world, and should always be kept above them....\r\n\r\n     Sir, if it be said to us that this is a natural right belonging\r\n     to women, I deny it. The right of suffrage is one to be\r\n     determined by expediency and by policy, and given by the State to\r\n     whom it pleases. It is not a natural right; it is a right that\r\n     comes from the State.[55]\r\n\r\n     It is claimed that if the suffrage be given to women it is to\r\n     protect them. Protect them from whom? The brute that would invade\r\n     their rights would coerce the suffrage of his wife or sister or\r\n     mother as he would wring from her the hard earnings of her toil\r\n     to gratify his own beastly appetites and passions.[56]\r\n\r\n     It is said that the suffrage is to be given to enlarge the sphere\r\n     of woman's influence. Mr. President, it would destroy her\r\n     influence. It would take her down from that pedestal where she is\r\n     today, influencing as a mother the minds of her offspring,\r\n     influencing by her gentle and kindly caress the action of her\r\n     husband toward the good and pure.[57]\r\n\r\nSenator Vest then presented a list of two hundred men from\r\nMassachusetts, among them forty-five clergymen, remonstrating against\r\nany further extension of suffrage to women. He next presented the\r\nold-time letter of Mrs. Clara T. Leonard of that State protesting\r\nagainst the enfranchisement of women. Senator Hoar called attention to\r\nthe fact that the writer herself was an office-holder, a member of the\r\nState Board of Lunacy and Charity, to which Senator Vest answered:\r\n\r\n     Ah! but what sort of an office-holder? She held the office\r\n     delegated to her by God himself, a ministering angel to the sick,\r\n     the afflicted and the insane. What man in his senses would take\r\n     from woman this sphere? What man would close to her the\r\n     charitable institutions and eleemosynary establishments of the\r\n     country? That is part of her kingdom; that is part of her\r\n     undisputed sway and realm. Is that the office to which woman\r\n     suffragists of this country ask us now to admit them? Is it to be\r\n     the director of a hospital? Is it to the presidency of a board of\r\n     visitors of an eleemosynary institution? Oh, no; they want to be\r\n     President, to be Senators and Members of the House of\r\n     Representatives and, God save the mark, ministerial and executive\r\n     officers, sheriffs, constables and marshals. Of course, this lady\r\n     is found on this board of directors. Where else should a true\r\n     woman be found? Where else has she always been found but by the\r\n     fevered brow, the palsied hand, the erring intellect, aye, God\r\n     bless them, from the cradle to the grave the guide and support of\r\n     the faltering steps of childhood and the weakening steps of old\r\n     age.[58]\r\n\r\n     Oh, no, Mr. President, this will not do. If we are to tear down\r\n     all the blessed traditions, if we are to desolate our homes and\r\n     firesides, if we are to unsex our mothers and wives and sisters\r\n     and turn our blessed temples of domestic peace into ward\r\n     political-assembly rooms, pass this joint resolution. But for one\r\n     I thank God that I am so old-fashioned that I would not give one\r\n     memory of my grandmother or of my mother for all the arguments\r\n     that could be piled, Pelion upon Ossa, in favor of this political\r\n     monstrosity.\r\n\r\n     I now present a pamphlet sent to me by a lady. I do not know\r\n     whether she be wife or mother. She signs this pamphlet as Adeline\r\n     D. T. Whitney. I have read it twice, and read it to pure and\r\n     gentle and intellectual women. I shall not read it today for my\r\n     strength does not suffice.[59] ... There is not one impure,\r\n     unintellectual aspiration or thought throughout the whole of it.\r\n     Would to God that I knew her, that I could thank her on behalf of\r\n     the society and politics of the United States for this\r\n     production. She says to her own sex: \"After all, men work for\r\n     women; or, if they think they do not, it would leave them but\r\n     sorry satisfaction to abandon them to such existence as they\r\n     could arrange without us.\"\r\n\r\n     Oh, how true that is, how true!\r\n\r\nThis pamphlet of over five thousand words which began, \"What is the\r\nlaw of woman-life? What was she made woman for, and not man?\"--might\r\nbe described as the apotheosis of the sentimental effusions of\r\nSenators Brown and Vest.\r\n\r\nDuring the discussion Senator George F. Hoar (Mass.) said:\r\n\r\n     Mr. President, I do not propose to make a speech at this late\r\n     hour of the day, it would be cruel to the Senate, and I had not\r\n     expected that this measure would be here this afternoon. I was\r\n     absent on a public duty and came in just at the close of the\r\n     speech of my honorable friend from Missouri. I wish, however, to\r\n     say one word in regard to what seemed to be the burden of his\r\n     speech.\r\n\r\n     He says that the women who ask this change in our political\r\n     organization are not simply seeking to be put upon school boards\r\n     and upon boards of health and charity and to fulfil all the large\r\n     number of duties of a political nature for which he must confess\r\n     they are fit, but he says they will want to be President of the\r\n     United States, and Senators and marshals and sheriffs, and that\r\n     seems to him supremely ridiculous. Now I do not understand that\r\n     this is the proposition. What they want is simply to be eligible\r\n     to such public duty as a majority of their fellow-citizens may\r\n     think they are fitted for. The most of the public duties in this\r\n     country do not require robust, physical health, or exposure to\r\n     what is base or unhealthy; and when those duties are imposed upon\r\n     anybody it will be only upon such persons as are fit for them.\r\n\r\n     My honorable friend spoke of the French revolution and the\r\n     horrors in which the women of Paris took part, and from that he\r\n     would argue that American wives and mothers and sisters are not\r\n     fit for the calm and temperate management of our American\r\n     republican life. His argument would require him by the same logic\r\n     to agree that republicanism itself is not fit for human society.\r\n     The argument is against popular government, whether by men or\r\n     women, and the Senator only applies to this new phase of the\r\n     claim of equal rights what his predecessors would have argued\r\n     against the rights which men now enjoy.\r\n\r\n     But the Senator thought it was unspeakably absurd that woman with\r\n     her sentiment and emotional nature and liability to be moved by\r\n     passion and feeling should hold the office of Senator. Why, Mr.\r\n     President, the Senator's own speech is a refutation of its own\r\n     argument. Everybody knows that my honorable friend from Missouri\r\n     is one of the most brilliant men in this country. He is a\r\n     logician, he is an orator, he is a man of wide experience, he is\r\n     a lawyer entrusted with large interests; yet when he was called\r\n     upon to put forth this great effort of his, this afternoon, and\r\n     to argue this question which he thinks so clear, what did he do?\r\n     _He furnished the gush and the emotion and the eloquence, but\r\n     when he wanted an argument he had to call upon two women to\r\n     supply it._ If Mrs. Leonard and Mrs. Whitney have to make the\r\n     argument in the Senate of the United States for the\r\n     distinguished Senator from Missouri, it does not seem to me so\r\n     absolutely ridiculous that they should have, or that women like\r\n     them should have, seats in this body to make arguments of their\r\n     own.\r\n\r\nSenator Blair closed the debate by saying in part:\r\n\r\n     I appeal to Senators not to decide this question upon the\r\n     arguments which have been offered here today for or against the\r\n     merits of the proposition. I appeal to them to decide it upon\r\n     that other principle to which I have adverted, whether one-half\r\n     of the American people shall be permitted to go into the arena of\r\n     public discussion in the various States, and before their\r\n     Legislatures be heard upon the issue, \"Shall the Federal\r\n     Constitution be so amended as to extend this right of suffrage?\"\r\n     If, with this opportunity, those who believe in woman suffrage\r\n     shall fail, then they must be content; for I agree with the\r\n     Senators upon the opposite side of the chamber and with all who\r\n     hold that if the suffrage is to be extended at all, it must be by\r\n     the operation of existing law. I believe it to be an innate\r\n     right; yet even an innate right must be exercised only by the\r\n     consent of the controlling forces of the State. That is all woman\r\n     asks--that an amendment be submitted.\r\n\r\nThe opposition had presented three documents, each representing the\r\nviews of one woman, and one of these anonymous. Senator Blair\r\npresented a petition for the suffrage from the Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union of 200,000 members, signed by Miss Frances E.\r\nWillard, president, and the entire official board. This was\r\naccompanied by a strong personal appeal from a number of distinguished\r\nwomen, and hundreds of thousands of petitions had been previously\r\nsent. The Senator also received permission to have printed in the\r\n_Congressional Record_ the arguments made by the representatives of\r\nthe suffrage movement before the Senate committee in 1880 and\r\n1884.[60]\r\n\r\nA vote was then taken on the resolution to submit to the State\r\nLegislatures an amendment to the Federal Constitution forbidding the\r\ndisfranchisement of United States citizens on account of sex, which\r\nresulted in 16 yeas, 34 nays, 26 absent.[61] Of the absentees\r\nSenators Chace, Dawes, Plumb and Stanford announced that they would\r\nhave voted \"yea;\" Jones of Arkansas and Butler that they would have\r\nvoted \"nay.\"\r\n\r\nThus on January 25, 1887, occurred the first and only discussion and\r\nvote in the United States Senate on the submission of an amendment to\r\nthe Federal Constitution which should forbid disfranchisement on\r\naccount of sex, that took place up to the end of the nineteenth\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[31] The only time the direct question of woman suffrage ever had been\r\ndiscussed and voted on in the U. S. Senate was in December, 1866,\r\non the Bill to Regulate the Franchise for the District of\r\nColumbia--History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. II, p. 102; and in May,\r\n1874, on the Bill to Establish the Territory of Pembina--the same, p.\r\n545; but these were entirely distinct from the submission of a\r\nconstitutional amendment.\r\n\r\n[32] Extended space is accorded this discussion, as it might\r\nreasonably be expected that on the floor of the United States Senate\r\nwould be made the most exhaustive arguments possible on both sides of\r\nthis important question.\r\n\r\n[33] This report had been presented Mar. 28, 1884, by Senators T. W.\r\nPalmer, H. W. Blair, E. G. Lapham and H. B. Anthony.\r\n\r\n[34] The italics are made by the editors of the History.\r\n\r\n[35] Senator Brown did not enter the army during the Civil War.\r\n\r\n[36] As a lawyer Senator Brown was always exempt from jury service.\r\n\r\n[37] Senator Brown had this done by his representatives, as any woman\r\ncould do.\r\n\r\n[38] As every private family urgently needs the man and the woman, why\r\nare both not needed in this \"great aggregation?\"\r\n\r\n[39] Do women have no hardships or hazards in time of war?\r\n\r\n[40] If her duties are just as laborious, responsible and important as\r\nman's, do they not entitle her to a voice in the Government?\r\n\r\n[41] Since this tremendous responsibility is placed upon woman, why\r\nshould she not have a voice in the conditions which surround these\r\nchildren outside the home? Why should man alone determine these\r\nconditions which often counteract all the mother's training?\r\n\r\n[42] Senator Brown assumes that all women are wives and the mothers of\r\nyoung children, and that the mother's sense of duty would not hold her\r\nto the care of her children if she had a chance to go into politics.\r\n\r\n[43] Would any man be willing to exchange his influence for that of a\r\nwoman in the affairs of government?\r\n\r\n[44] This would seem to be the very influence which ought to be\r\nenforced by a vote.\r\n\r\n[45] In readjusting the qualifications for the suffrage the Southern\r\nStates have been very careful to secure the right to all the\r\nilliterate _white_ men.\r\n\r\n[46] Senator Brown says in the preceding paragraph that the \"delicate\r\nand lovely women\" would not remain at home but would consider it an\r\nimperative duty to go to the polls.\r\n\r\n[47] Is it because women lack physical strength that they are not\r\nallowed to practice law in Georgia or to act as notaries public or to\r\nfill any office, even that of school trustee, and that no woman is\r\npermitted to enter the State University? The men should at least give\r\ntheir \"queens\" and \"princesses\" and \"angels\" an education.\r\n\r\n[48] Yes, if the husband has to enforce it with a club. This paragraph\r\ndoes not tally with the one in the early part of the Senator's speech\r\nwhere all women were placed on a throne, and all men were declared to\r\nbe their natural protectors.\r\n\r\n[49] The picture of family life in Georgia is not alluring, but the\r\nSenator takes small account of the woman who does not happen to\r\npossess a \"male,\" or rather to be possessed by one.\r\n\r\n[50] Therefore the wife should not be allowed any individuality.\r\nStatistics, however, from the States where women do vote prove exactly\r\nthe opposite of this assertion in regard to divorce.\r\n\r\n[51] For account of the unconstitutional disfranchisement of the women\r\nof Washington Territory by its Supreme Court, see chapter on that\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[52] This does not seem to apply to negro suffrage in the Southern\r\nStates.\r\n\r\n[53] One hearing Senator Brown's blood-curdling descriptions would\r\nthink they were more than \"inconveniences.\"\r\n\r\n[54] Observe that Senator Vest's entire argument against woman\r\nsuffrage is based wholly on sentiment and emotion and is entirely\r\ndevoid of logic.\r\n\r\n[55] The Senator meant that it is a right which comes from the men of\r\nthe State, from one-half of its people.\r\n\r\n[56] Because of a few such brutes millions of women must be deprived\r\nof the suffrage. If women had some control over the conditions which\r\ntend to make men brutes, might the number not be lessened? The Senator\r\nignores entirely the secret ballot which would prevent the aforesaid\r\nbrutes from knowing how the women voted.\r\n\r\n[57] In the preceding paragraph she did not seem to be on a pedestal.\r\n\r\n[58] The advocates of woman suffrage have repeatedly had bills in the\r\nvarious Legislatures asking that women might be appointed on the\r\nboards of all State institutions, and as physicians in all where women\r\nand children are placed, but up to the present day not one woman is\r\nallowed this privilege in Senator Vest's own State of Missouri.\r\n\r\n[59] This does not accord with the argument of Senator Brown that man\r\nmust do the voting for the family on account of his superior physical\r\nstrength.\r\n\r\n[60] These were Susan B. Anthony, Nancy R. Allen, Lillie Devereux\r\nBlake, Lucinda B. Chandler, Abigail Scott Duniway, Helen M.

E. Metropolitan\r\nChurch of Washington, Jan. 25, 1887, continuing in session three days.\r\nOn no evening was the building large enough to accommodate the\r\naudience. The Rev. John P. Newman, pastor of the church, prayed\r\nearnestly for the blessing of God \"on these women, who, through good\r\nand evil report, have been striving for the right.\"[62] Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony came directly from the Capitol and opened the convention by\r\nreading a letter from Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was in England.\r\nShe then referred to the fact that while this convention was in\r\nsession the United States Senate was discussing the question of woman\r\nsuffrage. There would be taken the first direct vote in that body on a\r\nSixteenth Amendment to enfranchise women. The attention of the\r\nadvocates of woman suffrage was directed to Congress for the first\r\ntime when the Fourteenth Amendment was under discussion in 1865. That\r\narticle in the beginning was broad enough to include women but\r\npolitical expediency inserted the word \"male,\" so that if any State\r\nshould disfranchise any of its _male_ citizens they should be counted\r\nout of the basis of representation. She continued:\r\n\r\n     This taught us that we might look to Congress. We presented our\r\n     first petition in 1865. In December, 1866, came the discussion in\r\n     the Senate on the proposition to strike the word \"male\" from the\r\n     District of Columbia Suffrage Bill and nine voted in favor. From\r\n     that day we have gone forward pressing our claims on Congress.\r\n     Denied in the construction of the Fourteenth and Fifteenth\r\n     Amendments we have been trying for a Sixteenth Amendment. We have\r\n     gained so much as a special committee, who hear our arguments and\r\n     have four times reported in our favor; Senator Hoar, chairman in\r\n     1879, Senator Lapham in 1882, Senator Palmer in 1884, and Senator\r\n     Blair in 1886. This is the bill which is pending now. We are not\r\n     asking Congress to enfranchise us, because it does not possess\r\n     that power. We are asking it to submit a proposition to be voted\r\n     on by the Legislatures.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton's letter said in part:\r\n\r\n     For half a century we have tried appeals, petitions, arguments,\r\n     with thrilling quotations from our greatest jurists and\r\n     statesmen, and lo! in the year of our Lord, 1887, the best answer\r\n     we can wring from Senators Brown and Cockrell, in the shape of a\r\n     minority report, is a \"chimney corner letter\" written by a woman\r\n     ignorant of the first principles of republican government, which,\r\n     they say, gives a better statement of the whole question than\r\n     they are capable of producing. Verily this is a new departure in\r\n     congressional proceedings! Though a woman has not sufficient\r\n     capacity to vote, yet she has superior capacity to her\r\n     representatives in drawing up a minority report....\r\n\r\n     But if Senators Cockrell and Brown hope to dispose of the\r\n     question by remanding us to \"the chimney corner\" we trust their\r\n     constituents will send them to keep us company, that they may\r\n     enliven our retirement and make us satisfied 'in the sphere where\r\n     the Creator intended we should be' by daily intoning for us their\r\n     inspired minority report.\r\n\r\n     The one pleasant feature in this original document is the harmony\r\n     between the views of these gentlemen and their Creator. The only\r\n     drawback to our faith in their knowledge of what exists in the\r\n     Divine mind, is in the fact that they can not tell us when, where\r\n     and how they interviewed Jehovah. I have always found that when\r\n     men have exhausted their own resources, they fall back on \"the\r\n     intentions of the Creator.\" But their platitudes have ceased to\r\n     have any influence with those women who believe they have the\r\n     same facilities for communication with the Divine mind as men\r\n     have.\r\n\r\n     The right and liability to be called on to fight, if we vote, as\r\n     continually emphasized by our opponents, is one of the greatest\r\n     barriers in our way. If all the heroic deeds of women recorded in\r\n     history and our daily journals, and the active virtues so\r\n     forcibly illustrated in domestic life, have not yet convinced our\r\n     opponents that women are possessed of superior fighting\r\n     qualities, the sex may feel called upon in the near future to\r\n     give some further illustrations of their prowess. Of one thing\r\n     they may be assured, that the next generation will not argue the\r\n     question of woman's rights with the infinite patience we have had\r\n     for half a century, and to so little purpose. To emancipate\r\n     woman from the fourfold bondage she has so long suffered in the\r\n     State, the church, the home and the world of work, harder battles\r\n     than we have yet fought are still before us.\r\n\r\nMrs. Caroline Hallowell Miller (Md.) paid a beautiful tribute to Miss\r\nAnthony, \"the Sir Galahad in search of the Holy Grail,\" and closed\r\nwith an eloquent prophecy of future success. Mrs. Lillie Devereux\r\nBlake (N. Y.) gave a clever satire on The Rights of Men, which was\r\nvery imperfectly reported.\r\n\r\n     ....Surely it is time that some one on this platform should say\r\n     something for this half of humanity, which we really must confess\r\n     after all is an important half. Ought we not admit that men have\r\n     wrongs to complain of? Are they not constantly declaring\r\n     themselves our slaves? Is it not a well known fact, conceded even\r\n     here, that women shine in all the tints of the rainbow while men\r\n     must wear only costumes of dull brown and somber black? Nor is\r\n     this because men do not like bright colors, for never a belle in\r\n     all the sheen of satin and glimmer of pearls looks half so\r\n     happily proud as does a man when he has on a uniform, or struts\r\n     in a political procession with a white hat on his head, a red\r\n     ribbon in his buttonhole and a little cane in his hand.\r\n\r\n     Then, too, have not men, poor fellows, had to do all the talking\r\n     since the world began? Have we not heretofore been the silent\r\n     sex? Even to-day a thousand men speak from pulpit and platform\r\n     where one woman uplifts her voice.\r\n\r\n     But let us pass to other and more important rights which have\r\n     been denied to man in the past. The first right that any man\r\n     ought to be allowed--a right paramount to all others--is the\r\n     right to a wife. But look how even in this matter he has been\r\n     hardly dealt with. Has he had just standards set before him as to\r\n     what a wife should be? No, but he has been led to believe that\r\n     the weak woman, the dependent woman, is the one to be desired....\r\n\r\n     Look again at the unhappy mess into which man all by himself has\r\n     brought politics and public affairs. Is it not too bad to leave\r\n     him longer alone in his misery? Like the naughty boy who has\r\n     broken and destroyed his toys, who needs mamma to help him mend\r\n     them, and perhaps also to administer to him such wholesome\r\n     discipline as Solomon himself has advised--so does man need woman\r\n     to come to his rescue. Look what politics is now. Who to-day can\r\n     tell the difference between a Democrat and a Republican? Even a\r\n     Mugwump is becoming a doubtful being....\r\n\r\n     Do not these wrongs which men suffer appeal to our tenderest\r\n     sympathies? Is it not evident that the poor fellows can't go on\r\n     alone much longer, that it is high time we should take the boys\r\n     in hand and show them what a correct government really is?\r\n\r\n     There is another question which deserves our gravest\r\n     consideration. Man sinks or rises with woman; if she is degraded\r\n     he is tempted to vice; if she is oppressed he is brutalized. What\r\n     is the industrial condition of women to-day?...\r\n\r\n     In behalf of the sons, the brothers and the husbands of these\r\n     wage-earning women we ask for that political power which alone\r\n     will insure equality of pay without regard to sex. For the sake\r\n     of man's redemption and morality we demand that this injustice\r\n     shall cease, for it is not possible for woman to be half-starved\r\n     and man not dwarfed; for many women to be degraded and all men's\r\n     lives pure; for women to be fallen and no man lost.\r\n\r\n     We all know that man himself has been most willing to grant to\r\n     women every right, every opportunity. If he has hesitated it has\r\n     been rather from love and admiration of woman than from any\r\n     tyrannical desire of oppression. He has said that women must not\r\n     vote because they can not perform military duty. Can they not\r\n     serve the nation as well as those men, who during the last war\r\n     sent substitutes and to-day hold the highest places in the\r\n     Government? But we ask one question: Which every year does most\r\n     for the State, the soldier or the mother who risks her life not\r\n     to destroy other life but to create it? Of the two it would be\r\n     better to disfranchise the soldiers and enfranchise the mothers.\r\n     For much as the nation owes to the soldiers, she owes far more to\r\n     the mothers who in endless martyrdom make the nation a\r\n     possibility....\r\n\r\n     Man deserves that we should consider his present unhappy\r\n     condition. In all ages he has proved his reverence for woman by\r\n     embodying every virtue in female form, and has left none for\r\n     himself. Truth and chastity, mercy and peace, charity and\r\n     justice, all are represented as feminine, and lately, as a proof\r\n     of his devotion, he has erected at the entrance to the harbor of\r\n     our greatest metropolis a statue of liberty and this too is\r\n     represented as a woman.... And so we hail the men, liberty\r\n     enlightening a world where woman and man shall alike be free.\r\n\r\nOne interesting address followed another throughout the convention,\r\npresenting the question of suffrage for women with appeal, humor,\r\nlogic, statistics and every variety of argument.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harriette Robinson Shattuck (Mass.) presented in striking\r\ncontrast The Women Who Ask and the Women Who Object. Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nBoynton Harbert in a fine address told of Our Motherless Government.\r\nMrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker (Conn.) gave for the first time her\r\nmasterly speech, The Constitutional Rights of the Women of the United\r\nStates, which has been so widely circulated in pamphlet form, and\r\nwhich closed with this peroration:\r\n\r\n     There are those who say we have too many voters already. No, we\r\n     have not too many. On the contrary, to take away the ballot even\r\n     from the ignorant and perverse is to invite discontent, social\r\n     disturbance, and crime. The restraints and benedictions of this\r\n     little white symbol are so silent and so gentle, so atmospheric,\r\n     so like the snow-flakes that come down to guard the slumbering\r\n     forces of the earth and prepare them for springing into bud,\r\n     blossom, and fruit in due season, that few recognize the divine\r\n     alchemy, and many impatient souls are saying we are on the wrong\r\n     path--the Old World was right--the government of the few is safe;\r\n     the wise, the rich, should rule; the ignorant, the poor, should\r\n     serve. But God, sitting between the eternities, has said\r\n     otherwise, and we of this land are foreordained to prove His word\r\n     just and true. And we will prove it by inviting every newcomer to\r\n     our shore to share our liberties so dearly bought and our\r\n     responsibilities now grown so heavy that the shoulders which bear\r\n     them are staggering under their weight; that by the joys of\r\n     freedom and the burdens of responsibility they, with us, may grow\r\n     into the stature of perfect men, and our country realize at last\r\n     the dreams of the great souls who, \"appealing to the Supreme\r\n     Judge of the world for the rectitude of their intentions,\" did\r\n     \"ordain and establish the Constitution for the United States of\r\n     America\"--the grandest charter of human rights that the world has\r\n     yet conceived.\r\n\r\nIn an impassioned address Mrs. Mary Seymour Howell (N. Y.) contrasted\r\nThe Present and the Past, saying:\r\n\r\n     The destiny of the world to-day lies in the hearts and brains of\r\n     her women. The world can not travel upward faster than the feet\r\n     of her women are climbing the paths of progress. Put us back if\r\n     you can; veil us in harems; make us beasts of burden; take from\r\n     us all knowledge; teach us we are only material; and humanity\r\n     will go back to the dark ages. The nineteenth century is closing\r\n     over a world arising from bondage. It is the grandest, sublimest\r\n     spectacle ever beheld. The world has seen and is still looking at\r\n     the luminous writing in the heavens--\"The truth shall make you\r\n     free\"--and for the first time is gathering to itself the true\r\n     significance of liberty. All the progress of these years has not\r\n     come easily or from conservatism, but from the persistent efforts\r\n     of enthusiastic radicals, men and women with ideas in their heads\r\n     and courage in their hearts to make them practical.\r\n\r\n     Ever since woman took her life in her own hands, ever since she\r\n     began to think for herself, the dawning of a great light has\r\n     flooded the world. We are the mothers of men. Show me the mothers\r\n     of a country and I will tell you of the sons. If men would ever\r\n     rise above their sensuality and materialism, they must have\r\n     mothers whose pure souls, brave hearts and clear intellects have\r\n     touched them deeply before their birth and equipped them for the\r\n     journey of life....\r\n\r\n     It is the evening of the nineteenth century, but the starlight is\r\n     clearer than the morning of its existence. I look back and see in\r\n     each year improvement and advancement. I see woman gathering up\r\n     her soul and personality and claiming them as her own against all\r\n     odds and the world. I see her asking that this personality may\r\n     be impressed upon her nation. I see her speaking her soul from\r\n     platforms, preaching in pulpits of a life of which this is the\r\n     shadow. I see her pleading before courts, using her brains to\r\n     solve the knotty questions of the law. Woman's sphere is the wide\r\n     world, her sceptre the mind that God has given her, her kingdom\r\n     the largest place that she has the brains to fill and the will to\r\n     hold. So is woman influencing the world, and as her sphere widens\r\n     the world grows better. With the freedom she now has, see how she\r\n     is arousing the public conscience on all questions of right....\r\n\r\n     What is conservatism? It is the dying faith of a closing century.\r\n     What is fanaticism? It is the dawning light of a new era. Yes, a\r\n     new era will dawn with the twentieth century. I look to that time\r\n     and see woman the redeeming power of the world.\r\n\r\nMrs. Pearson of Nottingham gave a glowing account of the progress of\r\nsuffrage in England and the work of the Primrose League; Madame Clara\r\nNeymann (N. Y.) made a scholarly address entitled Skeptics and\r\nSkepticism; Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby (Neb.), the Rev. Rush R. Shippen\r\nof Washington City and Miss Phoebe W. Couzins (Mo.) were among the\r\nspeakers. Delegate Joseph M. Carey (Wy.) said in the course of his\r\naddress:\r\n\r\n     Eighteen years ago the right of suffrage was given to the women\r\n     of Wyoming. Women have voted as universally and as\r\n     conscientiously as men. I have had the honor of voting for women\r\n     and of being voted for by them. There are not three per cent. of\r\n     women old enough who do not vote in every part of the Territory.\r\n     In intelligence, beauty, grace, in perfection of home and social\r\n     duties, the women of Wyoming will compare favorably with those of\r\n     any other State. I have been asked if they neglect home affairs\r\n     on account of politics. I have never known an instance of this. I\r\n     have never known a controversy to arise from the wives voting\r\n     differently from their husbands, which they often do. If women\r\n     could vote in the States to-day they would vote as wisely as\r\n     men....\r\n\r\n     I will say to woman's credit she has not sought office, she is\r\n     not a natural office-seeker, but she desires to vote, has\r\n     preferences and exercises her rights. The superintendents in\r\n     nearly all the counties are women. They have taken a deep\r\n     interest in school matters and as a rule they control school\r\n     meetings. Three-fourths of the voters present at these are women.\r\n     In Cheyenne they alone seem to have the time to attend. Give\r\n     woman this right to vote and she will make out of the boys men\r\n     more capable of exercising it. I have seen the results and am\r\n     satisfied that every woman should have the suffrage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carey sat on the platform with Miss Anthony, Mrs. Hooker and\r\nother prominent members of the convention. The eloquent address of\r\nMrs. May Wright Sewall (Ind.) on The Conditions of Liberty attracted\r\nspecial attention. Mrs. Caroline Gilkey Rogers (N. Y.) proved in an\r\noriginal manner that There is Nothing New under the Sun. In a\r\nstatesmanlike paper Mrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage (N. Y.) set forth the\r\nauthority of Congress to secure to woman her right to the ballot:\r\n\r\n     To protect all citizens in the use of the ballot by national\r\n     authority is not to deprive the States of the right of local\r\n     self-government. When Andrew Jackson, who had been elected as a\r\n     State's Rights man, asserted the supremacy of the National\r\n     Government, that assertion, carried out as it was, did not\r\n     deprive States of their power of self-government. Neither did the\r\n     Reconstruction Acts nor the adoption of the Fourteenth and\r\n     Fifteenth Amendments. Yet in many ways it is proved that States\r\n     are not sovereign. Besides their inability to coin money, to\r\n     declare peace and war, they are proved by their own acts not even\r\n     to be self-protective. If women as individuals, as one-half of\r\n     the people, call upon the nation for protection, they are doing\r\n     no more nor less than so-called sovereign States themselves do.\r\n     National aid has been frequently asked to preserve peace, or to\r\n     insure that protection found impossible under mere local or State\r\n     authority....\r\n\r\n     In ratifying an amendment States become factors in the nation,\r\n     the same as by the acts of their representatives and senators in\r\n     Congress. A law created by themselves in this way can be no\r\n     interference with their local rights of self-government; because\r\n     in helping enact these laws, either through congressional action,\r\n     or by legislative ratification of amendments, each State has\r\n     arisen above and beyond itself into a higher national realm.\r\n\r\n     The one right above all others which is not local is the right of\r\n     self-government. That right being the corner stone on which the\r\n     nation was founded, is a strictly national right. It is not\r\n     local, it is not State....\r\n\r\n     It does not matter by what instrumentality--whether by State\r\n     constitution or by statute law--woman has been deprived of her\r\n     national right of self-government, it is none the less the duty\r\n     of Congress to protect her in regaining it. Surely her right to\r\n     govern herself is of as much value as the protection of property,\r\n     the quelling of riots, the destruction or establishment of banks,\r\n     the guarding of the polls, the securing of a free ballot for the\r\n     colored race or the taking of it from a Mormon voter.\r\n\r\nIn her address on The Work of Women, Miss Mary F. Eastman (Mass.)\r\nsaid: \"Men say the work of the State is theirs. The State is the\r\npeople. The origin of government is simply that two men call in a\r\nthird for umpire. The ideal of the State is gradually rising. No State\r\ncan be finer in its type of government than the individuals who make\r\nit. We enunciate a grand principle, then we are timid and begin\r\nrestricting its application. We are a nation of infidels to\r\nprinciple.\"\r\n\r\nThe leading feature of the last evening was the address of Mrs.\r\nZerelda G. Wallace (Ind.) on Woman's Ballot a Necessity for the\r\nPermanence of Free Institutions. A Washington paper said: \"As she\r\nstood upon the platform, holding her hearers as in her hand, she\r\nlooked a veritable queen in Israel and the personification of womanly\r\ndignity and lofty bearing. The line of her argument was irresistible,\r\nand her eloquence and pathos perfectly bewildering. Round after round\r\nof applause greeted her as she poured out her words with telling\r\neffect upon the great congregation before her, who were evidently in\r\nperfect accord with her earnest and womanly utterances.\"\r\n\r\nAn imperfect extract from a newspaper report will suggest the trend of\r\nher argument:\r\n\r\n     In this Nineteenth annual convention, reviewing what these\r\n     nineteen years have brought, we find that we have won every\r\n     position in the field of argument for our cause. By its dignity\r\n     and justice we have overcome ridicule, although our progress has\r\n     been impeded by the tyranny of custom and prejudice.\r\n\r\n     I will ask the American question \"will it pay\" to enfranchise the\r\n     women of this nation--I will not say republic? The world has\r\n     never been blessed with a republic. Those who think this is a\r\n     narrow struggle for woman's rights have never conceived the\r\n     height, length and breadth of this momentous question.\r\n\r\n     The purpose of divinity is enunciated in that it is said He would\r\n     create humanity in His image. The purpose of the Creator is that\r\n     the two are to have dominion; woman is included in the original\r\n     grant. Free she must be before you yourselves will be free. The\r\n     highest form of development is to govern one's self. No man\r\n     governs himself who practices injustice to another....\r\n\r\n     We have passed through one Gethsemane because of our refusal to\r\n     co-operate with the Deity in His purpose to establish justice and\r\n     liberty on this continent. It took a hundred years and a Civil\r\n     War to evolve the principle in our nation that all men were\r\n     created free and equal. Will it require another century and\r\n     another Civil War before there is secured to humanity the\r\n     God-given inalienable right to \"life, liberty and the pursuit of\r\n     happiness?\" The most superficial observer can see elements at\r\n     work, a confusion of forces, that can only be wiped out in blood,\r\n     unless some new, unifying power is brought into Government. No\r\n     class was ever known to extend a right or share the application\r\n     of a just principle as long as it could safely retain these\r\n     exclusively for itself.\r\n\r\n     We have no quarrel with men. They are grand and just and noble in\r\n     exact proportion as their spiritual nature is exalted. As sure\r\n     as you live down low to the animal that is in you, will the\r\n     animal dominate your nature. Woman is the first to recognize the\r\n     Divine. When God was incarnated in humanity, when the Word was\r\n     made flesh and born of a woman, the arsenal of Heaven was\r\n     exhausted to redeem the race....\r\n\r\n     Woman is your last resource, and she will not fail you. I have\r\n     faith that humanity is to be perfected. Examine the record for\r\n     yourselves. I do not agree with the view of some of our divines.\r\n     We find the Creator taking a survey, and man is the only creation\r\n     he finds imperfect. Therefore a helpmeet is created for him.\r\n     According to accepted theology the first thing that helpmeet does\r\n     is to precipitate him into sin. I have unbounded faith in the\r\n     plans of God and in His ability to carry them out, and when He\r\n     said He would make a helpmeet I believe He did it, and that Eve\r\n     helped Adam, gave him an impetus toward perfection, instead of\r\n     causing him to fall. Man was a noble animal and endowed with\r\n     intellectual ability, but Eve found him a moral infant and tried\r\n     to teach him to discriminate between good and evil. That is the\r\n     first and greatest good which comes to anybody, and Adam, instead\r\n     of falling down when he ate the apple, rose up. There is no moral\r\n     or spiritual growth possible without being able to discern good\r\n     from evil. Adam was an animal superior to all others that\r\n     preceded him, but it needed a woman to quicken his spiritual\r\n     perceptions.\r\n\r\n     Eve having taken it upon herself to teach man to know the\r\n     difference between good and evil, the responsibility rests upon\r\n     woman to teach man to choose the good and refuse the evil. She\r\n     will do this if she has freedom of opportunity.\r\n\r\n     Man has been given schools to develop brain power, and I do not\r\n     underrate their value. He has nearly entered into his domain as\r\n     far as the material forces are concerned, but there is a moral\r\n     and spiritual element in humanity which eludes his grasp in\r\n     practically everything he undertakes. This lack of the moral\r\n     element is to-day our greatest danger. We do not ask for the\r\n     ballot because men are tyrants, but because God has made us the\r\n     conservators of the race. To-day we are queens without a scepter;\r\n     the penalty to the nation is that men are largely indifferent to\r\n     its best interests and many do not vote. Men are under the\r\n     influence of women during the formative period of their lives,\r\n     first of their mothers, then of women teachers; how can they do\r\n     otherwise than underestimate the value of citizenship? How can\r\n     the young men of this nation be inspired with a love of justice?\r\n     It is a dangerous thing that the education of citizens is given\r\n     over to women, unless these teachers have themselves the rights\r\n     of citizens. How can you expect such women as have addressed you\r\n     here in this convention to teach the youth to honor a Government\r\n     which thus dishonors women?\r\n\r\n     The world has never known but one Susan B. Anthony. God and the\r\n     world needed her and God gave her to the world and to humanity.\r\n     The next Statue of Liberty will have her features. Of all the\r\n     newspaper criticisms and remarks which have been made about her I\r\n     read one the other day which exactly suited me; it called her\r\n     \"that grand old champion of progress.\"\r\n\r\n     The women are coming and the men will be better for their coming.\r\n     Men say women are not fit to govern because they can not fight.\r\n     When men live upon a very low plane so there is only one way to\r\n     manage them and that is to knock them on the head, that is true.\r\n     It probably was true of government in the beginning, but we are\r\n     to grow up out of this low state.\r\n\r\n     When we reach the highest development, moral and spiritual forces\r\n     will govern. That women can and do govern even in our present\r\n     undeveloped condition is shown by the fact that three-fourths of\r\n     our educators are women. I remember when it used to be said, \"You\r\n     can not put the boys and girls into the hands of women, because\r\n     they can not thrash them.\" To-day brute force is almost entirely\r\n     eliminated from our schools. That women should not take part in\r\n     government because they can not fight was probably true in ages\r\n     gone by when governments were maintained by brute force, but it\r\n     does not obtain in a government ruled by public opinion expressed\r\n     on a little piece of paper. Women as a class do not fight, and\r\n     that is the reason they are needed to introduce into government a\r\n     power of another kind, the power with which women govern their\r\n     children and their husbands, that beautiful law of love which is\r\n     to be the only thing that remains forever....\r\n\r\n     Our statesmen are doubting the success of self-government. They\r\n     say universal suffrage is a failure, forgetting that we have\r\n     never had universal suffrage. The majority of the race has never\r\n     expressed its sense in government. We are a living falsehood when\r\n     we compare the basic principles of our Government with things as\r\n     they are now. It is becoming a common expression, \"The voice of\r\n     the people is not the voice of God.\" If you do not find God in\r\n     the voice of the people you can not find him anywhere. It is\r\n     said, \"Power inheres in the people,\" and the nation is shorn of\r\n     half its power for progress as long as the ballot is not in the\r\n     hands of women.\r\n\r\n     What has caused heretofore the downfall of nations? The lack of\r\n     morality in government. It will eat out the life of a nation as\r\n     it does the heart of an individual. This question of woman's\r\n     equal rights, equal duties, equal responsibilities, is the\r\n     greatest which has come before us. The destiny of the whole race\r\n     is comprised in four things: Religion, education, morals,\r\n     politics. Woman is a religious being; she is becoming educated;\r\n     she has a high code of morals; she will yet purify politics.\r\n\r\n     I want to impress upon the audience this thought, that every man\r\n     is a direct factor in the legislation of this land. Every woman\r\n     is not a direct factor, but yet is more or less responsible for\r\n     every evil existing in the community. I have nothing but pity for\r\n     that woman who can fold her hands and say she has all the rights\r\n     she wants. How can she think of the great problem God has given\r\n     us to solve--to redeem the race from superstition and crime--and\r\n     not want to put her hand to the wheel of progress and help move\r\n     the world?\r\n\r\nMrs. Hannah Whitall Smith (Penn.) pronounced the benediction at the\r\nclosing session.\r\n\r\nSixteen States were represented at this Nineteenth convention, and\r\nreports were sent from many more. Mrs. Sewall, chairman of the\r\nexecutive committee, presented a comprehensive report of the past\r\nyear's work, which included appeals to many gatherings of religious\r\nbodies. Conventions had been held in each congressional district of\r\nKansas and Wisconsin. She referred particularly to the completion of\r\nthe last of the three volumes of the History of Woman Suffrage by Miss\r\nAnthony, Mrs. Stanton and Mrs. Gage. An elaborate plan of work was\r\nadopted for the coming year, which included the placing of this\r\nHistory in public libraries, a continuation of the appeals to\r\nreligious assemblies, the appointment of delegates to all of the\r\napproaching national political conventions, and the holding by each\r\nvice-president of a series of conventions in the congressional\r\ndistricts of her State. It was especially desired that arrangements\r\nshould be made for the enrollment in every State of the women who want\r\nto vote, and Mrs. Colby was appointed to mature a suitable plan.\r\n\r\nAmong the extended resolutions adopted were the following:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, For the first time a vote has been taken in the Senate\r\n     of the United States on an amendment to the National Constitution\r\n     enfranchising women; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Nearly one-third of the Senators voted for the\r\n     amendment; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we rejoice in this evidence that our demand is\r\n     forcing itself upon the attention and action of Congress, and\r\n     that when a new Congress shall have assembled, with new men and\r\n     new ideas, we may hope to change this minority into a majority.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The Anti-Polygamy bill passed by both Houses of Congress\r\n     provides for the disfranchisement of the non-polygamous women of\r\n     Utah; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The women thus sought to be disfranchised have been for\r\n     years in the peaceable exercise of the ballot, and no charge is\r\n     made against them of any crime by reason of which they should\r\n     lose their vested rights; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That this association recognizes in these measures a\r\n     disregard of individual rights which is dangerous to the\r\n     liberties of all; since to establish the precedent that the\r\n     ballot may be taken away is to threaten the permanency of our\r\n     republican form of government.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we call the attention of the working women of\r\n     the country to the fact that a disfranchised class is always an\r\n     oppressed class and that only through the protection of the\r\n     ballot can they secure equal pay for equal work.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we recognize as hopeful signs of the times the\r\n     indorsement of woman suffrage by the Knights of Labor in national\r\n     assembly, and by the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union,\r\n     and that we congratulate these organizations upon their\r\n     recognition of the fact that the ballot in the hands of woman is\r\n     necessary for their success.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we extend our sympathy to our beloved president,\r\n     in the recent death of her husband, Henry B. Stanton; and we\r\n     recall with gratitude the fact that he was one of the earliest\r\n     and most consistent advocates of human liberty.\r\n\r\nThanks were extended to the United States Senators who voted for a\r\nSixteenth Amendment. A committee was appointed, Mrs. Blake, chairman,\r\nto wait upon President Grover Cleveland and protest against the\r\nthreatened disfranchising of the women of Washington Territory; also\r\nto secure a hearing before the proper congressional committee in\r\nreference to the Edmunds-Tucker Bill, which proposed to disfranchise\r\nboth the Gentile and Mormon women of Utah. The usual large number of\r\nletters were received.[63]\r\n\r\nThe following letter was read from ex-United States Treasurer F. E.\r\nSpinner, the first official to employ women:\r\n\r\n     I am eighty-five years old, and I can no longer look forward for\r\n     future earthly happiness. All my joys are now retrospective, and\r\n     in the long vista of years that I constantly look back upon,\r\n     there is no time that affords me more pleasure than that when I\r\n     was in the Treasury of the United States. The fact that I was\r\n     instrumental in introducing women to employment in the offices of\r\n     the Government, gives me more real satisfaction than all the\r\n     other deeds of my life.\r\n\r\nA committee consisting of the national board and chairman of the\r\nexecutive committee was appointed to arrange for a great international\r\nmeeting the next year.\r\n\r\nOn the opening day of this convention a vote on woman suffrage was\r\ntaken in the United States Senate as described in the preceding\r\nchapter; at its close a telegram was received that a Municipal\r\nSuffrage Bill had been passed by the Kansas Legislature; and its\r\nmembers separated with the consciousness that two distinctly\r\nprogressive steps had been taken.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[62] Dr. Newman was an advocate of suffrage for women. After he became\r\nBishop he wrote for publication, July 12, 1894: \"The exalted mission\r\nof Christianity is to reverse the verdict of the world on the rights\r\nof woman. Until Christ came she had been regarded by State and Church,\r\nin the most highly civilized lands, as the servant of man, created for\r\nhis pleasure and subordinated to his authority. Her rights of life,\r\nproperty and vocation were in his hands for control and final\r\ndisposition.\r\n\r\n\"Against this tyranny we wage a war of extermination. Henceforth in\r\nState and Church, in business and pleasure, whether married or single,\r\nwoman is to be esteemed an individual, one of the two equal units of\r\nhumanity, to count one the whole world over, and to possess and\r\nexercise the rights of 'life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness.'\"\r\n\r\n[63] Among the writers were Harriot Stanton Blatch of England, the\r\nRev.

C., March 25, continuing until\r\nApril 1. The origin of this great body is briefly stated in the\r\nofficial report as follows: \"Visiting England and France in 1882, Mrs.\r\nStanton conceived the idea of an International Council of Women\r\ninterested in the movement for suffrage, and pressed its consideration\r\non the leading reformers in those countries. A few accepted the idea,\r\nand when Miss Anthony arrived in England early the following year,\r\nthey discussed the question fully with each other, and seeing that\r\nsuch a convention was both advisable and practicable, they resolved to\r\ncall it in the near future. On the eve of their departure, at a\r\nreception given them in Liverpool, the subject was presented and\r\nfavorably received. Among the guests were Priscilla Bright McLaren,\r\nMargaret Bright Lucas, Alice Scatcherd and Margaret E. Parker. The\r\ninitiative steps for an International Council were then taken and a\r\ncommittee of correspondence appointed.[64]\r\n\r\n\"When Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony returned to America it was\r\ndecided, in consultation with friends, to celebrate the fourth decade\r\nof the woman suffrage movement by calling an International Council.\r\nAt its nineteenth annual convention, January, 1887, the National\r\nSuffrage Association had resolved to assume the entire responsibility\r\nand to extend the invitation to all associations of women in the\r\ntrades, professions and reforms, as well as those advocating political\r\nrights. The herculean task of making all the necessary arrangements\r\nfell chiefly on Miss Anthony, Miss Rachel G. Foster (Avery) and Mrs.\r\nMay Wright Sewall, as Mrs. Stanton and Mrs. Spofford were in Europe.\r\nTo say nothing of the thought, anxiety, time and force expended, we\r\ncan appreciate in some measure the magnitude of the undertaking by its\r\nfinancial cost of nearly $12,000.\r\n\r\n\"This was the first attempt to convene an international body of women\r\nand its conception would have been possible only with those to whom\r\nthe whole cause of woman is indebted for its most daring and important\r\ninnovations. The call for this meeting was issued in June, 1887:\r\n\r\n     The first public demand for equal educational, industrial,\r\n     professional and political rights for women was made in a\r\n     convention held at Seneca Falls, New York, in the year 1848.\r\n\r\n     To celebrate the Fortieth Anniversary of this event, an\r\n     International Council of Women will be convened under the\r\n     auspices of the National Woman Suffrage Association, in Albaugh's\r\n     opera house, Washington, D. C., on March 25, 1888.\r\n\r\n     It is impossible to overestimate the far-reaching influence of\r\n     such a Council. An interchange of opinions on the great questions\r\n     now agitating the world will rouse women to new thought, will\r\n     intensify their love of liberty and will give them a realizing\r\n     sense of the power of combination.\r\n\r\n     However the governments, religions, laws and customs of nations\r\n     may differ, all are agreed on one point, namely: man's\r\n     sovereignty in the State, in the Church and in the Home. In an\r\n     International Council women may hope to devise new and more\r\n     effective methods for securing in these three institutions the\r\n     equality and justice which they have so long and so earnestly\r\n     sought. Such a Council will impress the important lesson that the\r\n     position of women anywhere affects their position everywhere.\r\n     Much is said of universal brotherhood, but for weal or woe, more\r\n     subtle and more binding is universal sisterhood.\r\n\r\n     Women recognizing the disparity between their achievements and\r\n     their labors, will no doubt agree that they have been trammeled\r\n     by their political subordination. Those active in great\r\n     philanthropic enterprises sooner or later realize that, so long\r\n     as women are not acknowledged to be the political equals of men,\r\n     their judgment on political questions will have but little\r\n     weight.\r\n\r\n     It is, however, neither intended nor desired that discussions in\r\n     the International Council shall be limited to questions touching\r\n     the political rights of women. Formal invitations requesting the\r\n     appointment of delegates will be issued to representative\r\n     organizations in every department of woman's work. Literary\r\n     Clubs, Art Unions, Temperance Unions, Labor Leagues, Missionary,\r\n     Peace and Moral Purity Societies, Charitable, Professional,\r\n     Educational and Industrial Associations will thus be offered\r\n     equal opportunity with Suffrage Societies to be represented in\r\n     what should be the ablest and most imposing body of women ever\r\n     assembled.\r\n\r\n     The Council will continue eight days, and its sixteen public\r\n     sessions will afford ample opportunity for reporting the various\r\n     phases of woman's work and progress in all parts of the world,\r\n     during the past forty years. It is hoped that all friends of the\r\n     advancement of women will lend their support to this undertaking.\r\n\r\n     On behalf of the National Woman Suffrage Association:\r\n\r\n                              ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, President.\r\n                              SUSAN B. ANTHONY, First Vice-Pres.\r\n                              MATILDA JOSLYN GAGE, Second Vice-Pres.\r\n                              RACHEL G. FOSTER, Corresponding Sec'y.\r\n                              ELLEN H. SHELDON, Recording Sec'y.\r\n                              JANE H. SPOFFORD, Treasurer.\r\n                              MAY WRIGHT SEWALL, Chairman Ex. Com.\r\n\r\n\"All of the intervening months from June until the next March were\r\nspent in the extensive preparations necessary to the success of a\r\nconvention which proposed to assemble delegates and speakers from many\r\nparts of the world. As the funds had to be raised wholly by private\r\nsubscription, no bureau with an expensive pay-roll was established but\r\nthe entire burden was carried by a few individuals, who contributed\r\ntheir services.\"[65]\r\n\r\nFifty-three organizations of women, national in character, of a\r\nreligious, patriotic, charitable, reform, literary and political\r\nnature, were represented on the platform by eighty speakers and\r\nforty-nine delegates, from England, Ireland, France, Norway, Denmark,\r\nFinland, India, Canada and the United States. Among the subjects\r\ndiscussed were Education, Philanthropies, Temperance, Industries,\r\nProfessions, Organizations, Social Purity, Legal, Political and\r\nReligious Conditions. While no restriction was placed upon the fullest\r\nexpression of the most widely divergent views upon these vital\r\nquestions of the age, the sessions, both executive and public, were\r\nabsolutely without friction.\r\n\r\nA complete stenographic report of these fifty-three meetings was\r\ntranscribed and furnished to the press by a thoroughly organized corps\r\nof women under the direction of Miss Mary F. Seymour of New York City,\r\nan unexcelled if not an unparalleled feat.[66] The management of the\r\nCouncil by the different committees was perfect in every detail, and\r\nthe eight days' proceedings passed without a break, a jar or an\r\nunpleasant circumstance.\r\n\r\nSaturday evening, March 23, Mr. and Mrs. Spofford, of the Riggs House,\r\ngave a reception to enable the people of Washington to meet the\r\ndistinguished speakers and delegates. The large parlors were thrown\r\nopen and finally the big dining-room, but the throng was so dense that\r\nit was almost impossible to move from one room to another.\r\n\r\nPresident and Mrs. Grover Cleveland received the Council Friday\r\nafternoon. Monday evening a reception was given by Senator and Mrs.\r\nThomas W. Palmer of Michigan, for which eight hundred invitations were\r\nsent to foreign legations, prominent officials and the members of the\r\nCouncil. Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford opened their elegant home on\r\nTuesday afternoon in honor of the pioneers in the woman suffrage\r\nmovement. In addition to these many special entertainments were given\r\nfor the women lawyers, physicians, ministers, collegiate alumnae,\r\netc., and those of a semi-private nature were far too numerous for\r\nmention.\r\n\r\nAlbaugh's Opera House was crowded to its capacity at all of the\r\nsixteen sessions. Religious services were held on both Sundays,\r\nconducted entirely by women representing many different creeds. Some\r\nof the old-time hymns were sung, but many were from modern\r\nwriters--Whittier, Samuel Longfellow, John W. Chadwick, Elizabeth\r\nBoynton Harbert, Julia Mills Dunn, etc. The assisting ministers for\r\nthe first Sunday were the Reverends Phebe A. Hanaford, Ada C. Bowles,\r\nAntoinette Brown Blackwell, Amanda Deyo. The Rev. Anna Howard Shaw\r\ngave the sermon, a matchless discourse on The Heavenly Vision.\r\n\r\n     \"Whereupon, O, King Agrippa, I was not disobedient unto the\r\n     heavenly vision.\" Acts, xxvi:19.\r\n\r\n     In the beauty of his Oriental home the Psalmist caught the vision\r\n     of the events in the midst of which you and I are living to-day.\r\n     And though he wrought the vision into the wonderful prophecy of\r\n     the 68th Psalm, yet so new and strange were the thoughts to men,\r\n     that for thousands of years they failed to catch its spirit and\r\n     understand its power.\r\n\r\n     The vision which appeared to David was a world lost in sin. He\r\n     heard its cry for deliverance, he saw its uplifted hands.\r\n     Everywhere the eyes of good men were turned toward the skies for\r\n     help. For ages had they striven against the forces of evil; they\r\n     had sought by every device to turn back the flood-tide of base\r\n     passion and avarice, but to no purpose. It seemed as if all men\r\n     were engulfed in one common ruin. Patient, sphinx-like, sat\r\n     woman, limited by sin, limited by social custom, limited by false\r\n     theories, limited by bigotry and by creeds, listening to the\r\n     tramp of the weary millions as they passed on through the\r\n     centuries, patiently toiling and waiting, humbly bearing the pain\r\n     and weariness which fell to her lot.\r\n\r\n     Century after century came forth from the divine life only to\r\n     pass into the great eternity--and still she toiled and still she\r\n     waited. At last, in the mute agony of despair, she lifted her\r\n     eyes above the earth to heaven and away from the jarring strifes\r\n     which surrounded her, and that which dawned upon her gaze was so\r\n     full of wonder that her soul burst its prison-house of bondage as\r\n     she beheld the vision of true womanhood. She knew then it was not\r\n     the purpose of the Divine that she should crouch beneath the\r\n     bonds of custom and ignorance. She learned that she was created\r\n     not from the side of man, but rather by the side of man. The\r\n     world had suffered because she had not kept her\r\n     divinely-appointed place. Then she remembered the words of\r\n     prophecy, that salvation was to come to the race not through the\r\n     man, but through the descendant of the woman. Recognizing her\r\n     mission at last, she cried out: \"Speak now, Lord, for thy servant\r\n     heareth thee.\" And the answer came: \"The Lord giveth the Word,\r\n     and the women that publish the tidings are a great host.\"\r\n\r\n     [Illustration: THE REV. ANNA HOWARD SHAW.\r\n\r\n     Vice-President-at-Large of National-American Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association.]\r\n\r\n     To-day the vision is a reality. From every land the voice of\r\n     woman is heard proclaiming the word which is given her, and the\r\n     wondering world, which for a moment stopped its busy wheel of\r\n     life that it might smite and jeer her, has learned at last that\r\n     wherever the intuitions of the human mind are called into special\r\n     exercise, wherever the art of persuasive eloquence is demanded,\r\n     wherever heroic conduct is based upon duty rather than impulse,\r\n     wherever her efforts in opening the sacred doors for the benefit\r\n     of truth can avail--in one and all these respects woman greatly\r\n     excels man. Now the wisest and best people everywhere feel that\r\n     if woman enters upon her tasks wielding her own effective armor,\r\n     if her inspirations are pure and holy, the Spirit Omnipotent,\r\n     whose influence has held sway in all movements and reforms, whose\r\n     voice has called into its service the great workmen of every age,\r\n     shall, in these last days, fall especially upon woman. If she\r\n     venture to obey, what is man that he should attempt to abrogate\r\n     her sacred and divine mission? In the presence of what woman has\r\n     already accomplished, who shall say that a true woman--noble in\r\n     her humility, strong in her gentleness, rising above all\r\n     selfishness, gathering up her varied gifts and accomplishments to\r\n     consecrate them to God and humanity--who shall say that such an\r\n     one is not in a position to do that for which the world will no\r\n     longer rank her other than among the first in the work of human\r\n     redemption? Then, influenced by lofty motives, stimulated by the\r\n     wail of humanity and the glory of God, woman may go forth and\r\n     enter into any field of usefulness which opens up before her....\r\n\r\n     In the Scripture from which the text is taken we recognize a\r\n     universal law which has been the experience of every one of us.\r\n     Paul is telling the story of a vision he saw, which became the\r\n     inspiration of his life, the turning point where his whole\r\n     existence was changed, when, in obedience to that vision, he put\r\n     himself in relation with the power to which he belonged, and\r\n     recognizing in that One which appeared to him on his way from\r\n     Jerusalem to Damascus his Divine Master, he also recognized that\r\n     the purpose of his life could be fulfilled only when, in\r\n     obedience to that Master, he caught and assimilated to himself\r\n     the nature of Him, whose servant he was....\r\n\r\n     Every reformer the world has ever seen has had a similar\r\n     experience. Every truth which has been taught to humanity has\r\n     passed through a like channel. No one of God's children has ever\r\n     gone forth to the world who has not first had revealed to him his\r\n     mission, in a vision.\r\n\r\n     To this Jew, bound by the prejudices of past generations, weighed\r\n     down by the bigotry of human creeds, educated in the schools of\r\n     an effete philosophy, struggling through the darkness and gloom\r\n     which surrounded him, when as a persecutor he sought to\r\n     annihilate the disciples of a new faith, there came this vision\r\n     into his life; there dawned the electric light of a great truth,\r\n     which found beneath the hatred and pride and passion which filled\r\n     his life and heart, the divine germ that is implanted in the soul\r\n     of each one of God's children....\r\n\r\n     Then came crowding through his mind new queries: \"Can it be that\r\n     my fathers were wrong, and that their philosophy and religion do\r\n     not contain all there is of truth? Can it be that outside of all\r\n     we have known, there lies a great unexplored universe to which\r\n     the mind of man can yet attain?\" And filled with the divine\r\n     purpose, he opened his heart to receive the new truth that came\r\n     to him from the vision which God revealed to his soul.\r\n\r\n     All down through the centuries God has been revealing in visions\r\n     the great truths which have lifted the race, step by step, until\r\n     to-day womanhood, in this sunset hour of the nineteenth century,\r\n     is gathered here from the East and the West, the North and the\r\n     South, women of every land, of every race, of all religious\r\n     beliefs. But diverse and varied as are our races, our theories,\r\n     our religions, yet we come together here with one harmonious\r\n     purpose--that of lifting humanity into a higher, purer, truer\r\n     life.\r\n\r\n     To one has come the vision of political freedom. She saw how the\r\n     avarice and ambition of one class with power made them forget the\r\n     rights of another. She saw how the unjust laws embittered\r\n     both--those who made them and those upon whom the injustice\r\n     rested. She recognized the great principles of universal\r\n     equality, seeing that all alike must be free; that humanity\r\n     everywhere must be lifted out of subjection into the free and\r\n     full air of divine liberty.\r\n\r\n     To another was revealed the vision of social freedom. She saw\r\n     that sin which crushed the lives of one class, rested lightly on\r\n     the lives of the other. She saw its blighting effect on both, and\r\n     she lifted up her voice and demanded that there be recognized no\r\n     sex in sin.\r\n\r\n     Another has come hither, who, gazing about her, saw men\r\n     brutalized by the rum fiend, the very life of a nation\r\n     threatened, and the power of the liquor traffic, with its hand on\r\n     the helm of the Ship of State, guiding it with sails full spread\r\n     straight upon the rocks to destruction. Then, looking away from\r\n     earth, she beheld a vision of what the race and our nation might\r\n     become, with all its possibility of wealth and power, if freed\r\n     from this burden, and forth upon her mission of deliverance she\r\n     sped her way.\r\n\r\n     Another beheld a vision of what it is to be learned, to explore\r\n     the great fields of knowledge which the Infinite has spread\r\n     before the world. And this vision has driven her out from the\r\n     seclusion of her own quiet life that she might give this great\r\n     truth to womanhood everywhere....\r\n\r\n     And so we come, each bearing her torch of living truth, casting\r\n     over the world the light of the vision that has dawned upon her\r\n     soul.\r\n\r\n     But there is still another vision which reaches above earth,\r\n     beyond time--a vision which has dawned upon many, that they are\r\n     here not to do their own work, but the will of Him who sent them.\r\n     And the woman who sees the still higher truth, recognizes the\r\n     great power to which she belongs and what her life may become\r\n     when, in submission to that Master, she takes upon herself the\r\n     nature of Him whom she serves.\r\n\r\n     We will notice in the second place the purpose of all these\r\n     visions which have come to us. Paul was not permitted to dwell on\r\n     the vision of truth which came to him. God had a purpose in its\r\n     manifestation, and that purpose was revealed when He said to the\r\n     wonder-stricken servant, \"Arise; for I have appeared unto thee\r\n     for this purpose, not that thou behold the truth for thyself, but\r\n     to make thee a minister and a witness both of that which thou\r\n     hast already seen and of other truths which I shall reveal unto\r\n     thee. Go unto the Gentiles. Give them the truth which thou shalt\r\n     receive that their eyes may be opened, and that they may be\r\n     turned from darkness to light; that they, too, may receive a like\r\n     inheritance with thyself....\"\r\n\r\n     This, then, is God's lesson to you and to me. He opens before our\r\n     eyes the vision of a great truth and for a moment He permits our\r\n     wondering gaze to rest upon it; then He bids us go forth. Jacob\r\n     of old saw the vision of God's messengers ascending and\r\n     descending, but none of them standing still.\r\n\r\n     Herein, then, lies the secret of the success of the reformer.\r\n     First the vision, then the purpose of the vision. \"I was not\r\n     disobedient unto the heavenly vision.\" This is the manly and\r\n     noble confession of one of the world's greatest reformers, and in\r\n     it we catch a glimpse of the secrets of the success of his\r\n     divinely-appointed mission. The difference between the Saul of\r\n     Tarsus and Paul the Prisoner of the Lord was measured by his\r\n     obedience. This, too, is a universal law, true of the life of\r\n     every reformer, who, having had revealed to him a vision of the\r\n     great truth, has in obedience to that vision carried it to\r\n     humanity. Though at first he holds the truth to himself, and\r\n     longs to be lifted up by its power, he soon learns that there is\r\n     a giving forth of that which one possesses which enriches the\r\n     giver, and that the more he gives of his vision to men the richer\r\n     it becomes, the brighter it grows, until it illuminates all his\r\n     pathway....\r\n\r\n     Yet Paul's life was not an idle dream; it was a constant struggle\r\n     against the very people whom he tried to save; his greatest foes\r\n     were those to whom he was sent. He had learned the lesson all\r\n     reformers must sooner or later learn, that the world never\r\n     welcomes its deliverers save with the dungeon, the fagot or the\r\n     cross. No man or woman has ever sought to lead his fellows to a\r\n     higher and better mode of life without learning the power of the\r\n     world's ingratitude; and though at times popularity may follow in\r\n     the wake of a reformer, yet the reformer knows popularity is not\r\n     love. The world will support you when you have compelled it to do\r\n     so by manifestations of power, but it will shrink from you as\r\n     soon as power and greatness are no longer on your side. This is\r\n     the penalty paid by good people who sacrifice themselves for\r\n     others. They must live without sympathy; their feelings will be\r\n     misunderstood; their efforts will be uncomprehended. Like Paul,\r\n     they will be betrayed by friends; like Christ in the agony of\r\n     Gethsemane, they must bear their struggle alone.\r\n\r\n     Our reverence for the reformers of the past is posterity's\r\n     judgment of them. But to them, what is that now? They have passed\r\n     into the shadows where neither our voice of praise or of blame\r\n     disturbs their repose.\r\n\r\n     This is the hardest lesson the reformer has to learn. When, with\r\n     soul aglow with the light of a great truth, she, in obedience to\r\n     the vision, turns to take it to the needy one, instead of finding\r\n     a world ready to rise up and receive her, she finds it wrapped in\r\n     the swaddling clothes of error, eagerly seeking to win others to\r\n     its conditions of slavery. She longs to make humanity free; she\r\n     listens to their conflicting creeds, and yearns to save them from\r\n     the misery they endure. She knows that there is no form of\r\n     slavery more bitter or arrogant than error, that truth alone can\r\n     make man free, and she longs to bring the heart of the world and\r\n     the heart of truth together, that the truth may exercise its\r\n     transforming power over the life of the world. The greatest test\r\n     of the reformer's courage comes when, with a warm, earnest\r\n     longing for humanity, she breaks for it the bread of truth and\r\n     the world turns from this life-giving power and asks instead of\r\n     bread a stone.\r\n\r\n     It is just here that so many of God's workmen fail, and\r\n     themselves need to turn back to the vision as it appeared to\r\n     them, and to gather fresh courage and new inspiration for the\r\n     future. This, my sisters, we all must do if we would succeed. The\r\n     reformer may be inconsistent, she may be stern or even impatient,\r\n     but if the world feels that she is in earnest she can not fail.\r\n     Let the truth which she desires to teach first take possession of\r\n     herself. Every woman who to-day goes out into the world with a\r\n     truth, who has not herself become possessed of that truth, had\r\n     far better stay at home.\r\n\r\n     Who would have dreamed, when at that great anti-slavery meeting\r\n     in London, some years ago, the arrogance and pride of men\r\n     excluded the women whom God had moved to lift up their voices in\r\n     behalf of the baby that was sold by the pound--who would have\r\n     dreamed that that very exclusion would be the keynote of woman's\r\n     freedom? That out of the prejudice of that hour God should be\r\n     able to flash upon the crushed hearts of those excluded the grand\r\n     vision which we see manifested here to-day? That out of a longing\r\n     for the liberty of a portion of the race, God should be able to\r\n     show to women the still larger vision of the freedom of all human\r\n     kind?\r\n\r\n     Grand as is this vision which meets us here, it is but the\r\n     dawning of a new day; and as the first beams of morning light\r\n     give promise of the radiance which shall envelop the earth when\r\n     the sun shall have arisen in all its splendor, so there comes to\r\n     us a prophecy of that glorious day when the vision which we are\r\n     now beholding, which is beaming in the soul of one, shall enter\r\n     the hearts and transfigure the lives of all.\r\n\r\nThe formal opening of the Council, Monday morning, March 25, was thus\r\ndescribed: \"The vast auditorium, perfect in its proportions and\r\narrangements, was richly decorated with the flags of all nations and\r\nof every State in the Union. The platform was fragrant with evergreens\r\nand flowers, brilliant with rich furniture, crowded with distinguished\r\nwomen, while soft music with its universal language attuned all hearts\r\nto harmony. The beautiful portrait of the sainted Lucretia Mott,\r\nsurrounded with smilax and lilies of the valley, seemed to sanctify\r\nthe whole scene and to give a touch of pathos to all the proceedings.\"\r\n\r\nThis great meeting, like so many before and since that time, was\r\nopened by Miss Anthony. After the invocation and the hymn, she said in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n     Forty years ago women had no place anywhere except in their\r\n     homes; no pecuniary independence, no purpose in life save that\r\n     which came through marriage. From a condition, as many of you can\r\n     remember, in which no woman thought of earning her bread by any\r\n     other means than sewing, teaching, cooking or factory work, in\r\n     these later years the way has been opened to every avenue of\r\n     industry, to every profession, whereby woman to-day stands almost\r\n     the peer of man in her opportunities for financial independence.\r\n     What is true in the world of work is true in education, is true\r\n     everywhere.\r\n\r\n     Men have granted us, in the civil rights which we have been\r\n     demanding, everything almost but the pivotal right, the one that\r\n     underlies all other rights, the one with which citizens of this\r\n     republic may protect themselves--the right to vote.\r\n\r\n     I have the pleasure of introducing to you this morning the woman\r\n     who not only joined with Lucretia Mott in calling the first\r\n     convention, but who for the greater part of twenty years has been\r\n     president of the National Suffrage Association--Mrs. Elizabeth\r\n     Cady Stanton.\r\n\r\nThe entire audience arose with clapping of hands and waving of\r\nhandkerchiefs to greet this leader, who had come from England to\r\nattend the Council. In the course of a long and dignified address of\r\nwelcome, she said:\r\n\r\n     Whether our feet are compressed in iron shoes, our faces hidden\r\n     with veils and masks; whether yoked with cows to draw the plow\r\n     through its furrows, or classed with idiots, lunatics and\r\n     criminals in the laws and constitutions of the State, the\r\n     principle is the same; for the humiliations of spirit are as real\r\n     as the visible badges of servitude. A difference in government,\r\n     religion, laws and social customs makes but little change in the\r\n     relative status of woman to the self-constituted governing\r\n     classes, so long as subordination in all countries is the rule of\r\n     her being. Through suffering we have learned the open sesame to\r\n     the hearts of each other. With the spirit forever in bondage, it\r\n     is the same whether housed in golden cages with every want\r\n     supplied, or wandering in the dreary deserts of life, friendless\r\n     and forsaken. Long ago we of America heard the deep yearnings of\r\n     the souls of women in foreign lands for freedom responsive to our\r\n     own. Mary Wollstonecraft, Madame de Stael, Madam Roland, George\r\n     Sand, Frederica Bremer, Elizabeth Barrett Browning, Frances\r\n     Wright and George Eliot alike have pictured the wrongs of woman\r\n     in poetry and prose. Though divided by vast mountain ranges,\r\n     oceans and plains, yet the psalms of our lives have been in the\r\n     same strain--too long, alas, in the minor key--for hopes deferred\r\n     have made the bravest hearts sometimes despairing. But the same\r\n     great over-soul has been our faith and inspiration. The steps of\r\n     progress already achieved in many countries should encourage us\r\n     to tune our harps anew to songs of victory....\r\n\r\n     I think most of us have come to feel that a voice in the laws is\r\n     indispensable to achieve success; that these great moral\r\n     struggles for higher education, temperance, peace, the rights of\r\n     labor, international arbitration, religious freedom, are all\r\n     questions to be finally adjusted by the action of government and\r\n     thus, without a direct voice in legislation, woman's influence\r\n     will be entirely lost.\r\n\r\n     Experience has fully proved that sympathy as a civil agent is\r\n     vague and powerless until caught and chained in logical\r\n     propositions and coined into law. When every prayer and tear\r\n     represents a ballot, the mothers of the race will no longer weep\r\n     in vain over the miseries of their children. The active interest\r\n     women are taking in all the great questions of the day is in\r\n     strong contrast with the apathy and indifference in which we\r\n     found them half a century ago, and the contrast in their\r\n     condition between now and then is equally marked. Those who\r\n     inaugurated the movement for woman's enfranchisement, who for\r\n     long years endured the merciless storm of ridicule and\r\n     persecution, mourned over by friends, ostracized in social life,\r\n     scandalized by enemies, denounced by the pulpit, scarified and\r\n     caricatured by the press, may well congratulate themselves on the\r\n     marked change in public sentiment which this magnificent\r\n     gathering of educated women from both hemispheres so triumphantly\r\n     illustrates....\r\n\r\n     We, who like the children of Israel, have been wandering in the\r\n     wilderness of prejudice and ridicule for forty years feel a\r\n     peculiar tenderness for the young women on whose shoulders we are\r\n     about to leave our burdens. Although we have opened a pathway to\r\n     the promised land and cleared up much of the underbrush of false\r\n     sentiment, logic and rhetoric intertwisted with law and custom,\r\n     which blocked all avenues in starting, yet there are still many\r\n     obstacles to be encountered before the rough journey is ended.\r\n     The younger women are starting with great advantages over us.\r\n     They have the results of our experience; they have superior\r\n     opportunities for education; they will find a more enlightened\r\n     public sentiment for discussion; they will have more courage to\r\n     take the rights which belong to them. Hence we may look to them\r\n     for speedy conquests. When we think of the vantage-ground woman\r\n     holds to-day, in spite of all the artificial obstacles placed in\r\n     her way, we are filled with wonder as to what the future mothers\r\n     of the race will be when free to have complete development.\r\n\r\n     Thus far women have been the mere echoes of men. Our laws and\r\n     constitutions, our creeds and codes, and the customs of social\r\n     life are all of masculine origin. The true woman is as yet a\r\n     dream of the future. A just government, a humane religion, a pure\r\n     social life await her coming....\r\n\r\nAt the close of this address Miss Anthony presented greetings from the\r\nWoman's Liberal Association of Bristol, England, signed by many\r\ndistinguished names; from the Woman Suffrage Association of Norway,\r\nand from a number of prominent women in Dublin.[67] There were also\r\nindividual letters from Mrs. Priscilla Bright McLaren and many other\r\nforeigners.[68]\r\n\r\nDr. Elizabeth C. Sargent and eight other women physicians of San\r\nFrancisco sent cordial good wishes. Congratulations were received from\r\nmany Americans,[69] and a cablegram from Mrs. Harriot Stanton Blatch,\r\nof England.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony then presented the foreign delegates: England, Mrs. Laura\r\nOrmiston Chant, Mrs. Alice Scatcherd, Mrs. Ashton Dilke, Madame Zadel\r\nB. Gustafson; Ireland, Mrs. Margaret Moore; France, Madame Isabella\r\nBogelot; Finland, Baroness Alexandra Gripenberg; Denmark, Madame Ada\r\nM. Frederiksen; Norway, Madame Sophie Magelsson Groth; Italy, Madame\r\nFanny Zampini Salazar; India, Pundita Ramabai Sarasvati; Canada, Mrs.\r\nBessie Starr Keefer.\r\n\r\nAfter all had acknowledged the introduction with brief remarks, Miss\r\nAnthony presented, amid much applause, Lucy Stone, Frances E. Willard,\r\nJulia Ward Howe, Isabella Beecher Hooker, Matilda Joslyn Gage, Clara\r\nBarton--the most eminent galaxy of women ever assembled upon one\r\nplatform. Frederick Douglass and Robert Purvis were introduced as\r\npioneers in the movement for woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible within the limits of one chapter to give even\r\nthe briefest synopsis of the addresses which swept through the week\r\nlike a grand procession. The program only could convey an idea of the\r\nvalue of this intellectual entertainment which called together, day\r\nafter day and night after night, audiences that taxed the capacity of\r\nthe largest opera house in Washington.[70]\r\n\r\nOn the second Sunday afternoon, Easter Day, the services consisted of\r\na symposium conducted by sixteen women, of all religious faiths and of\r\nnone. In the evening, when as in the morning a vast and interested\r\naudience was present, brief farewells were spoken by a number of the\r\nforeign delegates. The leading address was by Mrs. Zerelda G. Wallace\r\non the Moral Power of the Ballot. Mrs. Stanton closed the meeting with\r\na great speech, and the following resolution was adopted:\r\n\r\n     It is the unanimous voice of this International Council that all\r\n     institutions of learning and of professional instruction,\r\n     including schools of theology, law and medicine, should, in the\r\n     interests of humanity, be as freely opened to women as to men,\r\n     and that opportunities for industrial training should be as\r\n     generally and as liberally provided for one sex as for the other.\r\n     The representatives of organized womanhood in this Council will\r\n     steadily demand that in all avocations in which both men and\r\n     women engage, equal wages shall be paid for equal work; and they\r\n     declare that an enlightened society should demand, as the only\r\n     adequate expression of the high civilization which it is its\r\n     office to establish and maintain, an identical standard of\r\n     personal purity and morality for men and women.\r\n\r\nDuring the month of preparation for this International Council, the\r\nidea came many times to Mrs. Sewall that it should result in a\r\npermanent organization. The other members gave a cordial assent to\r\nthis proposition, and the necessary committees were appointed. Before\r\nthe delegates left Washington both a National and International\r\nCouncil of Women were formed.[71]\r\n\r\nImmediately following the Council the National Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation held its Twentieth annual convention in the Church of Our\r\nFather, April 3, 4, 1888. As there had been eight days of continuous\r\nspeech-making this meeting was devoted principally to the presenting\r\nof State reports and transacting of necessary business. There were,\r\nhowever, a number of addresses from the distinguished women who\r\nremained after the Council to attend this convention.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on National Enrollment, Mrs. Louisa Southworth of Ohio,\r\nchairman, reported 40,000 names of adult citizens who favored equal\r\nsuffrage; 9,000 of these were from Ohio and 9,000 from Nebraska. Women\r\nwere urged to send petitions to members of Congress from their\r\nrespective States. Mrs. Stanton was requested to prepare a memorial to\r\nbe presented to each of the national political conventions to be held\r\nduring the year, and committees were appointed to visit each for the\r\npurpose of securing in their platforms a recognition of woman\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting feature was the hearing before the Senate\r\nCommittee on Woman Suffrage, which took place April 2.[72] Mrs.\r\nStanton made the opening address, in which she took up the provisions\r\nof the Federal Constitution, one by one, and showed how they had been\r\nviolated in their application to women, saying:\r\n\r\n     Even the preamble of the Constitution is an argument for\r\n     self-government--\"We, the people.\" You recognize women as people,\r\n     for you count them in the basis of representation. Half our\r\n     Congressmen hold their seats to-day as representatives of women.\r\n     We help to swell the figures by which you are here, and too many\r\n     of you, alas, are only figurative representatives, paying little\r\n     heed to our rights as citizens.\r\n\r\n     \"No bill of attainder shall be passed.\" \"No title of nobility\r\n     granted.\" So says the Constitution; and yet you have passed bills\r\n     of attainder in every State of the Union making sex a\r\n     disqualification for the franchise. You have granted titles of\r\n     nobility to every male voter, making all men rulers, governors,\r\n     sovereigns over all women.\r\n\r\n     \"The United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a\r\n     republican form of government.\" And yet you have not a republican\r\n     form of government in a single State. One-half the people have\r\n     never consented to one law under which they live. They have\r\n     rulers placed over them in whom they have no choice. They are\r\n     taxed without representation, tried in our courts by men for the\r\n     violation of laws made by men, with no appeal except to men, and\r\n     for some crimes over which men should have no jurisdiction....\r\n\r\n     Landing in New York one week ago, I saw 400 steerage passengers\r\n     leave the vessel. Dull-eyed, heavy-visaged, stooping with huge\r\n     burdens and the oppressions endured in the Old World, they stood\r\n     in painful contrast with the group of brilliant women on their\r\n     way to the International Council here in Washington. I thought,\r\n     as this long line passed by, of the speedy transformation the\r\n     genial influences of equality would effect in the appearance of\r\n     these men, of the new dignity they would acquire with a voice in\r\n     the laws under which they live, and I rejoiced for them; but\r\n     bitter reflections filled my mind when I thought that these men\r\n     are the future rulers of our daughters; these will interpret the\r\n     civil and criminal codes by which they will be governed; these\r\n     will be our future judges and jurors to try young girls in our\r\n     courts, for trial by a jury of her peers has never yet been\r\n     vouchsafed to woman. Here is a right so ancient that it is\r\n     difficult to trace its origin in history, a right so sacred that\r\n     the humblest criminal may choose his juror. But alas for the\r\n     daughters of the people, their judges, advocates, jurors, must be\r\n     men, and for them there is no appeal. But this is only one wrong\r\n     among many inevitable for a disfranchised class. It is\r\n     impossible for you, gentlemen, to appreciate the humiliations\r\n     women suffer at every turn....\r\n\r\n     You have now the power to settle this question by wise\r\n     legislation. But if you can not be aroused to its serious\r\n     consideration, like every other step in progress, it will\r\n     eventually be settled by violence. The wild enthusiasm of woman\r\n     can be used for evil as well as good. To-day you have the power\r\n     to guide and direct it into channels of true patriotism, but in\r\n     the future, with all the elements of discontent now gathering\r\n     from foreign countries, you will have the scenes of the French\r\n     Commune repeated in our land. What women, exasperated with a\r\n     sense of injustice, have done in dire extremities in the nations\r\n     of the Old World, they will do here....\r\n\r\n     I will leave it to your imagination to picture to yourselves how\r\n     you would feel if you had had a case in court, a bill before some\r\n     legislative body or a political aspiration for nearly half a\r\n     century, with a continual succession of adverse decisions, while\r\n     law and common justice were wholly on your side. Such, honorable\r\n     gentlemen, is our case....\r\n\r\n     In the history of the race there has been no struggle for liberty\r\n     like this. Whenever the interest of the ruling classes has\r\n     induced them to confer new rights on a subject class it has been\r\n     done with no effort on the part of the latter. Neither the\r\n     American slave nor the English laborer demanded the right of\r\n     suffrage. It was given in both cases to strengthen the Liberal\r\n     party. The philanthropy of the few may have entered into those\r\n     reforms, but political expediency carried both measures. Women,\r\n     on the contrary, have fought their own battles and in their\r\n     rebellion against existing conditions have inaugurated the most\r\n     fundamental revolution the world has ever witnessed. The\r\n     magnitude and multiplicity of the changes involved make the\r\n     obstacles in the way of success seem almost insurmountable....\r\n\r\n     Society is based on this fourfold bondage of woman--Church,\r\n     State, Capital and Society--making liberty and equality for her\r\n     antagonistic to every organized institution. Where, then, can we\r\n     rest the lever with which to lift one-half of humanity from these\r\n     depths of degradation, but on \"that columbiad of our political\r\n     life--the ballot--which makes every citizen who holds it a full\r\n     armed monitor?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony then introduced a number of the foreign delegates who had\r\nbeen in attendance at the National Council. Mrs. Laura Ormiston Chant\r\nof England, in an eloquent address, said:\r\n\r\n     I stand here as the grandniece of one of the greatest orators and\r\n     clearest and wisest statesmen that Europe has known, Edmund\r\n     Burke. It seems to me an almost overwhelming humility that I\r\n     should be compelled to echo the magnificent impeachment that he\r\n     made against Warren Hastings, in our House of Commons, on behalf\r\n     of the oppressed women of Hindostan, in this my passionate appeal\r\n     on behalf of oppressed women all over the world....\r\n\r\n     By all you have held most sacred and beautiful in the women who\r\n     have loved you and made life possible for you--for their sake and\r\n     in their name--I do intreat that you will not allow your grandest\r\n     women to plead for another half century. Say rather \"the past has\r\n     been a long night of wrong, but the day has come and the hour in\r\n     which justice shall conquer.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Alice Scatcherd, delegate from the Liberal and the Suffrage\r\nAssociations of Leeds and neighboring cities, gave an interesting\r\naccount of the manner in which Englishwomen exercise the franchise and\r\nthe influence they wield in politics.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony then said, \"I have the pleasure of introducing to you the\r\nwoman who, twenty-five years ago, wrote the Battle Hymn of the\r\nRepublic, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe.\" Mrs. Howe spoke briefly, saying: \"My\r\nheart has been full with the words of others which have been here\r\nuttered; but a single word will enable me to cast in my voice with\r\ntheirs with all the emphasis that my life and such power as I have\r\nwill enable me to add. Gentlemen, what a voice you have here to-day\r\nfor universal suffrage. Think that not only we American women, your\r\nown kindred, appear here--and you know what we represent--but these\r\nforemost women from other countries, representing not alone the native\r\nintelligence and character of those countries, but deep and careful\r\nstudy and precious experience, and think that between them and us who\r\nask for suffrage, there is entire unanimity. We all say the same\r\nwords; we are all for the same thing....\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Caroline E. Merrick, wife of the former Chief Justice of\r\nLouisiana, addressed the committee with that deep and touching\r\nearnestness so characteristic of Southern women.\r\n\r\nAfter saying that women were present from every State and Territory\r\nwho would add their pleadings if there were time, Miss Anthony\r\nintroduced Mrs. Bessie Starr Keefer of Canada, who told of the good\r\neffects of woman suffrage in that country. Miss Anthony then said:\r\n\"Gentlemen of the committee, here stands before you one who is\r\ncommander-in-chief of an army of 250,000 women. It is said women do\r\nnot want to vote, but this woman has led this vast army to the\r\nballot-box, or to a wish to get there. I present to you Miss Frances\r\nE. Willard.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the only time Miss Willard ever appeared before a Suffrage\r\nCommittee in the Capitol, and she was heard with much interest.\r\nBeginning with the playful manner which rendered her speeches so\r\nattractive, she closed with great seriousness:\r\n\r\n     I suppose these honorable gentlemen think that we women want the\r\n     earth, when we only want half of it. We call their attention to\r\n     the fact that our brethren have encroached upon the sphere of\r\n     woman. They have definitely marked out that sphere, and then they\r\n     have proceeded with their incursion by the power of invention.\r\n     They have taken away the loom and the spinning-jenny, and they\r\n     have obliged Jenny to seek her occupation somewhere else. They\r\n     have set even the tune of the old knitting-needle to humming by\r\n     steam. So that we women, full of vigor and desire to be active\r\n     and useful and to react upon the world around us, finding our\r\n     industrial occupations largely gone, have been obliged to seek\r\n     out a new territory and to pre-empt from the sphere of our\r\n     brothers some of that which they have hitherto considered their\r\n     own.\r\n\r\n     I know it is a sentiment of chivalry in some good men which\r\n     hinders them from giving us the ballot. They think we might not\r\n     be what they admire so much; they think we should be lacking in\r\n     womanliness of character. I ask you to notice if the women who\r\n     have been in this International Council, if the women who are\r\n     school teachers all over this nation, if these hundreds of\r\n     thousands are not a womanly set of women, and yet they have gone\r\n     outside of the old sphere. We believe that in the time of peace\r\n     women can come forward and with peaceful plans can use weapons\r\n     which are grand and womanly, and that their thoughts, winged with\r\n     hope and the force of the heart given to them, will have an\r\n     effect far mightier than physical power. For that reason we ask\r\n     you that they shall be allowed to stand at the ballot-box,\r\n     because we believe that there every person expresses his\r\n     individuality. The majesty or the meanness of a person comes out\r\n     at the ballot-box more than anywhere else. The ballot is the\r\n     compendium of all there is in civilization, and of all that\r\n     civilization has done for us. We believe that the mothers who had\r\n     the good sense to train noble men, like you who have achieved\r\n     high positions, had the good sense to train your sisters in the\r\n     same way, and that it is a pity the State has lost that other\r\n     half of the conservative power which comes from a Christian\r\n     rearing and a Christian character.\r\n\r\n     I have spoken thus on the principles which have made me, a\r\n     conservative woman, devoted to the idea of the ballot, and one in\r\n     heart with all these good and true suffrage women, though not one\r\n     in organic community. I represent before you the Woman's\r\n     Christian Temperance Union and not a suffrage society, but I\r\n     bring these principles to your sight, and I ask you, my brothers,\r\n     to be grand and chivalrous towards us in this new departure which\r\n     we now wish to make.\r\n\r\n     I ask you to remember that it is women who have given the\r\n     costliest hostages to fortune, and out into the battle of life\r\n     they have sent their best beloved into snares that have been\r\n     legalized on every hand. From the arms which held him long, the\r\n     boy has gone forever, for he will not come back again to the\r\n     home. Then let the world in the person of its womanhood go forth\r\n     and make a home in the State and in society. By all the pains and\r\n     dangers the mother has shared, by the hours of patient watching\r\n     over beds where little children tossed in fever and pain, by the\r\n     incense of ten thousand prayers wafted to God from earnest lips,\r\n     I charge you, gentlemen, give woman power to go forth, so that\r\n     when her son undertakes life's treacherous battle, his mother\r\n     will still walk beside him clad in the garments of power.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony, who knew better than anyone else when not another word\r\nwas needed, said at the close of Miss Willard's touching address:\r\n\"Now, gentlemen, we are greatly obliged to you. I feel very proud of\r\nall my 'girls' who have come before you this morning, and you may\r\nconsider the meeting adjourned.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[64] The following report was prepared by Mrs. Parker: At a large and\r\ninfluential gathering of the friends of woman suffrage, at Parliament\r\nTerrace, Liverpool, November 16, 1883, convened by E. Whittle, M. D.,\r\nto meet Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony prior to their return to\r\nAmerica, a resolution was proposed by Mrs. Parker of Penketh, seconded\r\nby Mrs. McLaren of Edinburgh, and unanimously passed: \"Recognizing\r\nthat union is strength and that the time has come when women all over\r\nthe world should unite in the just demand for their political\r\nenfranchisement; therefore\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That we do here appoint a committee of correspondence,\r\npreparatory to forming an International Woman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n\"_Resolved_, That the committee consist of the following friends, with\r\npower to add to their number.\r\n\r\n\"For the American Center--Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony, Miss Rachel G. Foster. For Foreign Centers--(An extended\r\ncommittee was named of prominent persons in Great Britain, Ireland and\r\nFrance).\"\r\n\r\n[65] There were printed and distributed by mail 10,000 Calls (four\r\npages each); 10,000 Appeals (two pages each); sketches were prepared\r\nof the lives and work of a number of the delegates and circulated by\r\nmeans of a Press Committee of over ninety persons in various cities of\r\nmany States. On March 10, the first edition (5,000) of the\r\nsixteen-page program was issued; this was followed by five other\r\neditions of 5,000 each and a final seventh edition of 7,000 copies.\r\nEach edition required revision and the introduction of alterations\r\nmade necessary by changing conditions. There were written in\r\nconnection with the preparations about 4,000 letters. Including those\r\nconcerning railroad rates, there were not less than 10,000 more\r\ncirculars of various kinds printed and distributed. A low estimate of\r\nthe number of pages thus issued (circulars, calls, programs, etc.)\r\ngives 672,000. During the week of the Council and the following\r\nconvention of the N. W. S. A., the _Woman's Tribune_ was published by\r\nMrs. Clara Bewick Colby eight times (four days sixteen pages, four\r\ndays twelve pages), the daily edition averaging 12,500 copies.\r\n\r\nThe receipts from contributions and memberships were in round numbers\r\n$5,000; from sale of seats and boxes at opera-house $5,000, and from\r\nsale of daily _Woman's Tribune_, photographs and badges, collections,\r\nadvertisements, etc., $1,500, making a total of nearly $12,000. The\r\nlargest sums were from Julia T. Foster, $400; Elizabeth Thompson,\r\n$250; Mrs. Leland Stanford, $200; Rachel G. Foster, $200; and $100\r\neach from Adeline Thomson, Ellen Clark Sargent, Emma J. Bartol,\r\nMargaret Caine, Sarah Knox Goodrich, Mary Hamilton Williams, Lucy\r\nWinslow Curtis, Mary Gray Dow, Jane S. Richards, George W. Childs and\r\nHenry C. Parsons. The cost of the _Tribune_ (printing, stenographic\r\nreport, mailing, etc.) was over $3,600; hall rent, $1,800. When one\r\nconsiders the entertainment of so many officers, speakers and\r\ndelegates, printing, postage, the salary of one clerk for a year\r\n(whose board was a contribution from Miss Adeline Thomson and Miss\r\nJulia Foster of Philadelphia), and the thousand et ceteras of such a\r\nmeeting, the total cost of about $12,000 is not surprising. An\r\ninternational convention of men, held in Washington within the year,\r\ncost in round numbers $50,000.\r\n\r\n[66] After the Council Mrs. Stanton, Miss Anthony and Miss Foster\r\nremained in Washington for six weeks preparing a complete report of\r\nthe addresses and proceedings which filled nearly 500 pages. Five\r\nthousand copies of these were printed, a large number of which were\r\nplaced in the public libraries of the United States and foreign\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\n[67] Anna Maria Haslam, Honorable Secretary Woman's Suffrage\r\nAssociation; Mary Edmundson, Honorable Secretary Dublin Prison Gate\r\nMission; Hannah Maria Wigham, President Women's Temperance\r\nAssociation, Dublin, and Member of Peace Committee; Wilhelmina Webb,\r\nMember of Ladies' Sanitary Committee, Women's Suffrage, etc., Rose\r\nMcDowell, Honorable Secretary Women's Suffrage Committee, Isabella\r\nMulvany, Head Mistress Alexandra School, Dublin, Harriet W.

Blair, N. H.;\r\nThomas W. Palmer, Mich.; Jonathan Chace, R. I.; Thomas M. Bowen, Colo.\r\nNo hearing was held before the Judiciary Committee of the House, but\r\non April 24 Mrs. Sallie Clay Bennett of Kentucky obtained an audience\r\nand made an extended and unanswerable argument from two points of\r\nview, the Scriptural and the Constitutional. Her address is printed in\r\nfull in the _Woman's Tribune_ of April 28, 1888.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IX.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL SUFFRAGE CONVENTION OF 1889.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Twenty-first annual convention of the National Association met in\r\nthe Congregational Church at Washington, Jan. 21-23, 1889, in answer\r\nto the official Call:\r\n\r\n     Neither among politicians, nor among women themselves, is this in\r\n     any sense a party movement. While the Prohibition party in Kansas\r\n     incorporated woman suffrage in its platform, the Republicans made\r\n     it a fact by extending municipal suffrage to the women of that\r\n     State. The Democrats of Connecticut on several occasions voted\r\n     for woman suffrage while Republicans voted against it. In the New\r\n     York Legislature Republicans and Democrats alike have advocated\r\n     and voted for the measure. In Congress the last vote in the House\r\n     stood eighty Republicans for woman suffrage and nearly every\r\n     Democrat against it, while not a single Democrat voted in favor\r\n     of it on the floor of the Senate. Both the Labor and Greenback\r\n     parties have uniformly recognized woman suffrage in their\r\n     platforms.... Our strength for future action lies in the fact\r\n     that woman suffrage has some advocates in all parties and that\r\n     we, as an association, are pledged to none.\r\n\r\n     The denial of the ballot to woman is the great political crime of\r\n     the century, before which tariff, finance, land monopoly,\r\n     temperance, labor and all economic questions sink into\r\n     insignificance; for the right of suffrage involves all questions\r\n     of person and of property.\r\n\r\n     While each party in power has refused to enfranchise woman, being\r\n     skeptical as to her moral influence in government, yet with\r\n     strange inconsistency they alike seek the aid of her voice and\r\n     pen in all important political struggles. While not morally bound\r\n     to obey the laws made without their consent, yet we find women\r\n     the most law-abiding class of citizens in the community. While\r\n     not recognized as a component part of the Government, they are\r\n     most active in all great movements for education, religion,\r\n     philanthropy and reform.\r\n\r\n     The magnificent convocation of women from the world over--held in\r\n     Washington last March--a Council more important than any since\r\n     the Diet of Worms--was proof of woman's marvelous power of\r\n     organization and her clear comprehension of the underlying\r\n     principles of all questions of government. With such evidence of\r\n     her keen insight and executive ability, we invite all interested\r\n     in good government to give us the inspiration of their presence\r\n     in the coming convention.\r\n\r\nIn the absence of Mrs. Stanton Miss Anthony presided, opening her\r\naddress with the sentence, \"Here we have stood for the last twenty-one\r\nyears, demanding of Congress to take the necessary step to secure to\r\nthe women of this nation protection in the exercise of their\r\nconstitutional right to a voice in the government.\" She introduced the\r\nHon. Albert G. Riddle (D. C.), who in 1871 had made an argument before\r\nthe Joint Judiciary Committee in favor of woman's right to vote under\r\nthe Fourteenth Amendment; and later had argued before the Supreme\r\nCourt her right to vote in the District. In the course of his remarks\r\nhe said: \"All the changes in favor of woman--everything indeed that\r\nhas been achieved--has been in consequence of this contest for woman\r\nsuffrage. Its advocates began it; they traveled along with it; and all\r\nthat has been gained in the statutes of the various States and of the\r\nUnited States has been by their efforts; whatever has taken a\r\ncrystallized form of irrepealable law is because of this discussion,\r\nbecause of this agitation.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker (Conn.) read the resolution demanding a\r\nrepresentation of women in the Centennial Celebration of the Adoption\r\nof the United States Constitution soon to be held in New York City.\r\nMiss Anthony then introduced Senator Henry W. Blair (N. H.), who was\r\nreceived with much applause, as the unswerving champion of woman\r\nsuffrage. In an address considering the constitutional phase of the\r\nquestion, he said:\r\n\r\n     There has been such progress in the formulation of the State and\r\n     the national law that it has become necessary for the Supreme\r\n     Court of the United States to decide that we are not a sovereign\r\n     people, that we have no nation at all, in order to prevent woman\r\n     from exercising the right of suffrage throughout this country. In\r\n     that decision which deprived Mrs. Virginia L. Minor of her right,\r\n     the Supreme Court was driven to the necessity of deciding in\r\n     express terms, \"The United States has no voters of its own\r\n     creation.\" If the United States has no voters, then the old\r\n     doctrine of State sovereignty is the true one and there is no\r\n     nation. We are subservient and subordinate to the power of the\r\n     States to-day by virtue of this decision just exactly as it was\r\n     claimed we were prior to the recent war. We thought the war\r\n     established the fact that we were a nation; that the controversy\r\n     which led up to the war had been decided in favor of the\r\n     sovereignty of the nation. Under our republican form of\r\n     government the sovereignty is lodged in the masses of the people.\r\n     If, therefore, it is not in the man who votes by virtue of his\r\n     membership in the association of the people known as the United\r\n     States, then there is no sovereignty there....\r\n\r\n     As the law now is, in the Federal Constitution there must always\r\n     have been such a voter of the United States, for in the second\r\n     clause of the first article it is provided that there shall be a\r\n     House of Representatives \"elected by the people in the States.\"\r\n     Where that provision is made it says that the electors shall have\r\n     the qualifications of the electors in the States. But it does not\r\n     say that they shall be the same individuals; it does not say that\r\n     they are to act in the same capacity. They might vary in\r\n     different portions of the country, in different States; but\r\n     nevertheless, in giving to the people of the States the right to\r\n     specify the qualifications which should belong to the electors of\r\n     the United States, the Constitution did not give up the power to\r\n     create electors itself....\r\n\r\n     Take the Fifteenth Amendment. There is the first instance in the\r\n     entire Constitution where we find the franchise declared to be a\r\n     \"right,\" and in specific terms alluded to as such. And there it\r\n     is provided that a right already recognized as existing shall not\r\n     be abridged by the United States or by the States--a right\r\n     already _existing_, not _established_. And by virtue of that\r\n     amendment and the provision that this existing right shall not be\r\n     denied or abridged on account of \"race, color or previous\r\n     condition of servitude,\" either by the United States or by the\r\n     States, the _national existence_ of the voter is established....\r\n\r\n     I think our great difficulty about this is that women perhaps do\r\n     not, to the extent that they should, place their cause upon the\r\n     platform that it is a right; that to uphold that it is not a\r\n     right is a wrong greater than any which has been perpetrated in\r\n     the past; that freedom to half the human race is a glorious\r\n     achievement which it still remains for mankind to accomplish....\r\n\r\n     There is no way in which you can do so much for this world as by\r\n     giving liberty to those who are the mothers of the generations\r\n     past and to come; so that freedom to think, freedom to formulate\r\n     opinions, freedom to decide by the majority of the whole of\r\n     mature human nature, shall be the universal boon as far as the\r\n     human race extends....\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony then read a letter from Mrs. Stanton which embodied that\r\nspirit of independence possessed by her almost beyond all other women:\r\n\r\n     I notice that in some of our conventions resolutions of thanks\r\n     are passed to senators, congressmen and legislators for\r\n     advocating some minor privileges which have been conceded to\r\n     women, such as admission to colleges and professions, limited\r\n     forms of suffrage, etc. Now I do not see any occasion for\r\n     gratitude to these honorable gentlemen who, after robbing us of\r\n     all our fundamental rights as citizens, propose to restore a few\r\n     minor privileges. There is not one impulse of gratitude in my\r\n     soul for any of the fragmentary privileges which by slow degrees\r\n     we have wrung out of our oppressors during the last half century,\r\n     nor will there be so long as woman is robbed of all the essential\r\n     rights of citizenship.\r\n\r\n     If strong appeals could induce the highway robber to return a\r\n     modicum of what he had stolen, it might mitigate the miseries of\r\n     his victim, but surely there would be no reason for gratitude,\r\n     and an expression of thanks to him would be quite as much out of\r\n     place as are complimentary resolutions passed in our conventions\r\n     to legislators for their concessions to women. They deserve\r\n     nothing at our hands until they make full restitution of all we\r\n     possessed in the original compact under the colonial\r\n     constitutions--rights over which in the nature of things men\r\n     could have no lawful jurisdiction whatever.... Woman has the same\r\n     right to a voice in this government that man has, and it is based\r\n     on the same natural desire and capacity for self-government and\r\n     self-protection....\r\n\r\n     Until woman is recognized as an equal factor in civilization, and\r\n     is possessed of her personal property, civil and political\r\n     rights, all minor privileges and concessions are but so many\r\n     added aggravations, and are insulting mockeries of that justice,\r\n     liberty and equality which are the birthright of every citizen of\r\n     a republic. \"Universal suffrage,\" said Charles Sumner, \"is the\r\n     first proof and only basis of a genuine republic.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton referred to the bravery of recent women writers in\r\nattacking social problems, citing Mrs. Humphrey Ward, Margaret Deland,\r\nOlive Schreiner, Mona Caird and Helen Gardiner. She closed with a\r\ntribute to the co-laborers who had died during the past year, among\r\nthem the Rev. James Freeman Clarke, Judge Samuel E. Sewall, Dr.\r\nClemence S. Lozier, Dr. Mary F. Thomas, Miss Abby W. May and numerous\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nDuring the second day's proceedings the Rev. Alexander Kent, of the\r\nChurch of Our Father (Universalist), addressed the convention, saying\r\nin part:\r\n\r\n     It is not uncommon among writers on woman suffrage to find the\r\n     root of the trouble in those notions of the creation and fall set\r\n     forth in the ancient Jewish Scriptures--notions which have very\r\n     generally prevailed throughout Christendom until recently, and\r\n     which even yet have a large hold upon many people professing to\r\n     be Christians. In the account of the origin of evil given by the\r\n     ancient Hebrew writer, woman is the chief offender, and upon her\r\n     falls the burden of the penalty. In sorrow she is to bring forth\r\n     her children; her desire is to be to her husband and he is to\r\n     rule over her. Unquestionably this has tended to prolong the\r\n     reign of brute force in Christendom by perpetuating a belief in\r\n     the rightful headship of man in the family and State. But it is a\r\n     great mistake to see in this Scripture the root of the evil. It\r\n     is only the record of a theory offered to explain a fact--which\r\n     antedated both the theory and the record. We find the fact to-day\r\n     even where we do not find the record--the woman ruled by the man\r\n     in places where there is no knowledge whatever of the Hebrew\r\n     Scriptures. I doubt not that among the founders of our\r\n     Government--meaning the people generally--this doctrine of the\r\n     rightful headship of man and the subordination of woman was\r\n     sacredly held as a part of the revealed word of God, and that as\r\n     such it operated to keep the women as well as the men of that day\r\n     from perceiving the full significance, the comprehensive scope of\r\n     the principles affirmed by their leaders, in the Constitution and\r\n     the Declaration of Independence....\r\n\r\n     If the ballot in the hands of woman is to do a great work for\r\n     society, it will be first and foremost because of its wholesome\r\n     influence on herself--because it rouses in her more of hope, more\r\n     of laudable ambition, more of earnest purpose, more of\r\n     self-reliance, more independence of the fashions, frivolities and\r\n     conventionalities of society and the dictates of the church....\r\n\r\n     Praying for the speedy coming of this day, and hoping it may work\r\n     gradually toward a purer and happier social life, and a further\r\n     companionship in thought and feeling, in purpose and effort,\r\n     between men and women, and especially between husbands and wives\r\n     in the life of the home, I express my sympathy with the purpose\r\n     of this convention.\r\n\r\nMrs. Caroline Hallowell Miller (Md.) took the ground that, after fifty\r\nyears of argument, women now should unite in a continuous demand for\r\nthe rights of citizenship.\r\n\r\nIn introducing the Hon. William D. Kelley (Penn.) Miss Anthony said\r\nthat not only in Congress, where he was known as the Father of the\r\nHouse, but years ago in his own State Legislature, he advocated the\r\npolitical equality of women. After paying a tribute to his mother, to\r\nMary Wollstonecraft and to Frances Wright, he said: \"I am here,\r\nbecause I feel that I should again declare publicly the justice of the\r\nenfranchisement of women, which, having cherished through youth and\r\nearly manhood, I asserted in a public address in Independence Hall, at\r\nhigh noon on the Fourth of July, 1841, before there was any\r\norganization for promoting woman's rights politically.\" He then\r\nsketched results already achieved and urged women to keep the flame\r\nburning for the benefits which would come to posterity.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Olympia Brown (Wis.) spoke on Foreign Rule, and after\r\npointing out the glory of a country which offered a home to all, and\r\nexpressing a belief in universal suffrage, she continued:\r\n\r\n     In Wisconsin we have by the census of 1880 a population of\r\n     910,072 native-born, 405,425 foreign-born. Our last vote cast was\r\n     149,463 American, 189,469 foreign; thus you see nearly 1,000,000\r\n     native-born people are out-voted and out-governed by less than\r\n     half their number of foreigners. Is that fair to Americans? Is it\r\n     just to American men? Will they not, under this influence, in a\r\n     little while be driven to the wall and obliged to step down and\r\n     out? When the members of our Legislatures are the greater part\r\n     foreigners, when they sit in the office of mayor and in all the\r\n     offices of our city, and rule us with a rod of iron, it is time\r\n     that American men should inquire if we have any rights that\r\n     foreigners are bound to respect....\r\n\r\n     The last census shows, I think, that there are in the United\r\n     States three times as many American-born women as the whole\r\n     foreign population, men and women together, so that the votes of\r\n     women will eventually be the only means of overcoming this\r\n     foreign influence and maintaining our free institutions. There is\r\n     no possible safety for our free school, our free church or our\r\n     republican government, unless women are given the suffrage and\r\n     that right speedily.... The question in every political caucus,\r\n     in every political convention, is not what great principles shall\r\n     we announce, but what kind of a document can we draw up that will\r\n     please the foreigners?...\r\n\r\n     When we remember that the first foot to touch Plymouth Rock was a\r\n     woman's--that in the first settlement of this country women\r\n     endured trials and privations and stood bravely at the post of\r\n     duty, even fighting in the ranks that we might have a\r\n     republic--and that in our great Western world women came at an\r\n     early day to make the wilderness blossom as the rose, and rocked\r\n     their babies' cradles in the log cabins when the Indians'\r\n     war-whoop was heard on the prairies and the wolves howled around\r\n     their doors--when we remember that in the last war thousands of\r\n     women in the Northwest bravely took upon themselves the work of\r\n     the households and the fields that their husbands and sons might\r\n     fight the battles of liberty--when we recollect all this, and\r\n     then are told that loyal women, pioneer women, the descendants of\r\n     the Pilgrim Fathers, are not even to ask for the right of\r\n     suffrage lest the Scandinavians should be offended, it is time to\r\n     rise in indignation and ask, Whose country is this? Who made it?\r\n     Who have periled their lives for it?\r\n\r\n     Our American women are property holders and pay large taxes; but\r\n     the foreigner who has lived only one year in the State, and ten\r\n     days in the precinct, who does not own a foot of land, may vote\r\n     away their property in the form of taxes in the most reckless\r\n     manner, regardless of their interests and their rights. Women are\r\n     well-educated; they are graduating from our colleges; they are\r\n     reading and thinking and writing; and yet they are the political\r\n     inferiors of all the riff-raff of Europe that is poured upon our\r\n     shores. It is unbearable. There is no language that can express\r\n     the enormous injustice done to women....\r\n\r\n     We can not separate subjects and say we will vote on temperance\r\n     or on school matters, for all these questions are part of\r\n     government.... When women as well as men are voters, the church\r\n     will get some recognition. I marvel that all ministers are not in\r\n     favor of woman suffrage, when I consider that their audiences are\r\n     almost entirely composed of women and that the church to-day is\r\n     brought into disrepute because it is made up of disfranchised\r\n     members. The minister would stand a hundred-fold higher than he\r\n     does now if women had the suffrage. Everybody would want to know\r\n     what the minister was saying to those women voters.\r\n\r\n     We are in danger in this country of Catholic domination, not\r\n     because the Catholics are more numerous than we are, but because\r\n     the Catholic church is represented at the polls and the\r\n     Protestant church is not. The foreigners are Catholic--the\r\n     greater portion of them; the foreigners are men--the greater part\r\n     of them, and members of the Catholic church, and they work for it\r\n     and vote for it. The Protestant church is composed of women. Men\r\n     for the most part do not belong to it; they do not care much for\r\n     it except as something to interest the women of their household.\r\n     The consequence is the Protestant church is comparatively\r\n     unrepresented at the ballot-box....\r\n\r\n     I urge upon you, women, that you put suffrage first and foremost,\r\n     before every other consideration upon earth. Make it a religious\r\n     duty and work for the enfranchisement of your sex, which means\r\n     the growth and development of noble characters in your children;\r\n     for you can not educate your children well surrounded by men and\r\n     women who hold false doctrines of society, of politics, of\r\n     morals. Leave minor issues, leave your differences of opinion\r\n     about the Trinity, or the Holy Ghost, or endless misery; about\r\n     high license and low license; or Dorcas Societies and Chautauqua\r\n     Circles. Let them all go; they are of no consequence compared\r\n     with the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary Seymour Howell gave a humorous series of Suffrage Pictures\r\nin New York, which was greatly relished by the audience. Mrs. Laura M.\r\nJohns described Municipal Suffrage in Kansas in an enthusiastic and\r\ninteresting manner. The Rev. Anna Howard Shaw then delivered her\r\nlecture, which has since become so famous, The Fate of Republics,\r\ntracing the rise and fall of the republics of history, which grew\r\nbecause of material prosperity and failed because of moral weakness.\r\nAll were in the hands of men, and women were excluded from any\r\nshare.[73]\r\n\r\nMrs. Harriette R. Shattuck gave an account of the recent school\r\nelection in Boston where 19,490 women voted, a much higher percentage\r\nof those registered than of the men, and thus defeated the dangerous\r\nattempt which had been made by the Church to interfere with the State.\r\nRichard W. Blue, State Senator of Kansas, was called to the platform\r\nby Mrs. Gougar as one who had greatly aided its Municipal Suffrage\r\nBill.\r\n\r\nMrs. May Wright Sewall (Ind.) spoke on Women in the Recent Campaign.\r\nIn the National Prohibition Convention they sat as delegates and\r\nserved on committees. In all parts of the country Republican and\r\nDemocratic women organized clubs and marched in processions; but she\r\ncalled attention to the fact that these methods are not advocated by\r\nthe suffrage societies so long as women remain disfranchised. Over two\r\nhundred clubs were formed for political study. All of the parties\r\nplaced women on their platforms to speak in behalf of the candidates.\r\nA Central Republican Headquarters was opened in New York and put in\r\ncharge of a national committee of women who sent out hundreds of\r\nthousands of campaign documents. When election day came not one of all\r\nthese women could put her opinion in the ballot-box.\r\n\r\nAt the evening session Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake (N. Y.) in her\r\ntrenchant way discussed Political Methods and pointed out the\r\ninconsistent and illogical declarations of platforms and speakers when\r\napplied to women, also the delight afforded to men by the tin horns\r\nand fireworks. She suggested for President Harrison's Cabinet,\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, Secretary of State; Susan B. Anthony,\r\nSecretary of War; May Wright Sewall, Secretary of the Treasury;\r\nZerelda G. Wallace, Secretary of the Navy; Clara Barton, Secretary of\r\nthe Interior; Laura de Force Gordon, Attorney-General.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sarah M. Perkins (O.) spoke on The Concentration of Forces,\r\nshowing how prone women are to organize for every object except\r\nsuffrage, and yet the majority of these workers would rejoice to have\r\nthe power which lies in the ballot and would be infinitely better\r\nequipped for their work.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary B. Clay (Ky.) opened the last day's session with a forcible\r\naddress entitled, Are American Women Civil and Political Slaves? She\r\nproved the affirmative of her question by quoting the spoken and\r\nwritten declarations of the greatest statesmen on the right of\r\nindividual representation and the exceptions made against women,\r\nciting Walker, the legal writer: \"This language applied to males would\r\nbe the exact definition of political slavery; applied to females,\r\ncustom does not so regard it.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Abigail Scott Duniway (Ore.) described the recent arbitrary and\r\nunwarranted disfranchisement of the women of Washington Territory.\r\nFrederick Douglass was loudly called for and in responding expressed\r\nhis gratitude to women, \"who were chiefly instrumental in liberating\r\nmy people from actual chains of bondage,\" and declared his full belief\r\nin their right to the franchise.\r\n\r\nMrs. Helen M. Gougar (Ind.) made a strong speech upon Partisan or\r\nPatriot? In her address on Woman in Marriage Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby,\r\neditor of the _Woman's Tribune_, said:\r\n\r\n     It is customary to regard marriage as of even more importance to\r\n     woman than to man, since the maternal, social and household\r\n     duties involved in it consume the greater portion of the time and\r\n     thought of a large majority. Love, it is commonly said, is an\r\n     incident in a man's life, but makes or mars a woman's whole\r\n     existence. This, however, is one of the many popular delusions\r\n     crystallized into opinion by apt phraseology. To one who believes\r\n     in the divinely intended equality of the sexes it is impossible\r\n     to consider that any mutual relation is an incident for the one\r\n     and the total of existence for the other. We may lay it down as a\r\n     premise upon which to base our whole reasoning that all mutual\r\n     relations of the sexes are not only divinely intended to, but\r\n     actually do bring equal joys, pains, pleasures and sacrifices to\r\n     both. Whatever mistake one has made has acted upon the other, and\r\n     reacted equally upon the first.\r\n\r\n     The one great mistake of the ages--since woman lost her primal\r\n     independence and supremacy--to which is due all the sins and\r\n     sorrows growing out of the association of the sexes, has been in\r\n     making woman a passive agent instead of an equal factor in\r\n     arranging the laws, customs and conditions of this mutual state.\r\n     Whether marriage be a purely business partnership for the care\r\n     and maintenance of children, or whether it be a sacrament to\r\n     which the benediction of the church gives peculiar sanctity and\r\n     perpetuity and makes the parties \"no more twain but one flesh,\"\r\n     in either case it is an absurdity, which we only tolerate because\r\n     of custom, for men alone to make all the regulations and\r\n     stipulations concerning it.\r\n\r\n     This unnatural and strained assumption by one sex of the control\r\n     of everything relating to marriage, and the equally unnatural and\r\n     mischievous passivity on the part of the other, have given birth\r\n     to the meek maiden waiting for her fate, to the typical\r\n     disconsolate and forlorn \"superfluous woman,\" to the two\r\n     standards of morality for the sexes, to the mercenary marriage\r\n     with all its attendant miseries, to the selfish, exacting,\r\n     querulous wife, to the disappointed or tyrannical husband; and of\r\n     late, with the wider possibilities of individual pleasure and\r\n     satisfaction, to the growing aversion of young people to\r\n     matrimony, and the rush of women to the divorce courts for\r\n     freedom from the galling bonds; all these and a thousand\r\n     variations of each, until the nature of both sexes is so\r\n     perverted that it is impossible to decide what is nature.\r\n\r\nA letter was read from Mrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage (N. Y.) urging women\r\nindividually to petition Senators and Representatives for the removal\r\nof their political disabilities, because by this means these men were\r\ncompelled to think on the question.\r\n\r\nMrs. Virginia L. Minor (Mo.) addressed the convention on The Law of\r\nFederal Suffrage, a legal argument on the right to vote conferred by\r\nthe Constitution. Miss Anthony supplemented Mrs. Minor's argument with\r\na history of the Fourteenth Amendment, in which she said:\r\n\r\n     When that Fourteenth Amendment was under discussion--when it was\r\n     proposed to put the word \"male\" into the second section--it read:\r\n     \"If any State shall disfranchise any of its citizens on account\r\n     of color, all of that class shall be counted out of the basis of\r\n     representation.\" But there were timid souls on the floor of\r\n     Congress at the close of the war, as well as at other periods of\r\n     our history, and to prevent the enfranchisement of women by this\r\n     amendment they moved to make it read: \"If any State shall\r\n     disfranchise any of its _male_ citizens, all of that class shall\r\n     be counted out of the basis of representation.\" Male citizens!\r\n     For the first time in the history of our Government that\r\n     discriminating adjective was placed in the Constitution, and yet\r\n     the men on the floor of Congress, from Charles Sumner down, all\r\n     declared that this amendment would not in any wise change the\r\n     status of women!\r\n\r\n     We at once asserted our right to vote under this amendment: \"All\r\n     persons born or naturalized in the United States, and subject to\r\n     the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and\r\n     of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce\r\n     any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of\r\n     citizens of the United States.\" Our first trial was on civil\r\n     rights, when Mrs. Myra Bradwell of Chicago, who had been for some\r\n     time publishing a law journal which every lawyer in the State\r\n     said he could not afford to do without, applied for admission to\r\n     the bar, and these same lawyers denied it. She appealed to the\r\n     Illinois Supreme Court and it confirmed the denial, because she\r\n     was not only a woman but a married woman. Then she appealed her\r\n     case to the Supreme Court of the United States, and a majority of\r\n     this court decided that the right to be a lawyer was not\r\n     especially a citizen's right and that therefore the State of\r\n     Illinois could legally abridge the privileges and immunities of\r\n     its women by denying them admission to the bar.\r\n\r\n     I shall never forget how our hearts sank when in 1871 that\r\n     decision came, declaring the powerlessness of the Federal\r\n     Constitution to protect women in their civil right of being\r\n     eligible to the legal profession. When we said if these rights\r\n     which it is meant to protect are not civil they must be political\r\n     rights, we thought we had the Supreme Court in a corner. But when\r\n     my trial for voting came on, Justice Hunt said that the right to\r\n     vote was a special right belonging to men alone. We didn't\r\n     believe that this decision could be confirmed, but it was, when\r\n     Mrs. Minor, who attempted to vote at the same election in her\r\n     State of Missouri, appealed her case to the Supreme Court of the\r\n     United States. It was argued by her husband, the ablest of\r\n     lawyers, and when the Judges brought in their decision it was to\r\n     the effect that the Constitution of the United States has no\r\n     voters. Thus it is that we have two Supreme Court decisions\r\n     relative to the powers of the Fourteenth Amendment to protect\r\n     women, and in both cases they have been excluded absolutely from\r\n     its provisions.\r\n\r\n     I remember, Mrs. Minor (turning to that lady), how we discussed\r\n     these questions in those early years. We weren't sleepy in our\r\n     talk as we were being cut off inch by inch from the protection of\r\n     the Constitution. I remember how Mrs. Stanton said in a public\r\n     address: \"If you continue to deny to women the protection of this\r\n     amendment, you will finally come to the point when it will cease\r\n     to protect even black men,\" and we have lived to see that day.\r\n\r\nThe address on The Coming Sex by Mrs. Eliza Archard Connor, a\r\nwell-known journalist of New York, was declared by the press to be in\r\nits delivery \"the gem of the convention.\" She said in part:\r\n\r\n     It is my conviction that women are the natural orators of the\r\n     race. They have keener sympathies and quicker intuitions than\r\n     men. They have a gift of language that not even their worst\r\n     enemies will deny, and these are just the qualities which go to\r\n     make the orator.... The time is coming when we shall need all our\r\n     eloquence, all our intellectual power and all our love. The day\r\n     is approaching when men will come with ballots in their hands,\r\n     begging women to use them....\r\n\r\n     Wherever you go, wake women up, tell them to learn everything.\r\n     Tell them to study with all their might history, civil\r\n     government, political economy, social and industrial science--for\r\n     the time is coming when they will need them all....\r\n\r\n     This is the work before us. This is the meaning of the desperate\r\n     unrest and unhappiness of women. It is this that has drawn us\r\n     here to enter our protest against the wicked, old, one-legged\r\n     order of things. Our honored Miss Anthony has gone through fire\r\n     and hail while she worked for her convictions. All of us have\r\n     wrought as best we might for the higher education of women, for\r\n     their pecuniary independence, for their civil and political\r\n     rights, fighting the world, the flesh and the devil.\r\n\r\n     My own work has been in the field of journalism. For nearly\r\n     twenty years I have faced here every form of disability because I\r\n     am a woman, have met defeat after defeat, till the iron has\r\n     entered my soul. Yet every day I have thanked God that I have\r\n     been permitted to bear my share in the tremendous struggle for\r\n     the development of women in the nineteenth century. Struggle\r\n     means development; it can come in no other way, and this will be\r\n     the grandest since creation began--the crowned, perfected woman.\r\n     For this the cry of womanhood has risen out of the depths through\r\n     the centuries. Up through agony and despair it has come, through\r\n     sin and shame, through poverty and martyrdom, through torture\r\n     which has wrung drops of blood from woman's lips, still up, up,\r\n     till it has reached the great white throne itself.\r\n\r\nThe enrollment committee reported a list of about one hundred thousand\r\nnames of persons asking for woman suffrage. The treasurer announced\r\nthe receipts for 1888 to be $12,510. All of the expenses of the great\r\nInternational Council had been paid and a balance of nearly $300\r\nremained.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions might be described as an epitomized recital of wrongs\r\nand a Bill of Rights.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Women possessed and exercised the right of suffrage in\r\n     the inauguration of this Government; and,\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, They were deprived of this right by the arbitrary Acts\r\n     of successive State Legislatures in violation of the original\r\n     compact as seen in the early constitutions; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the duty of the several States to make\r\n     prompt restitution of these ancient rights, recognized by\r\n     innumerable precedents in English history, and to-day by the\r\n     gradual extension of the suffrage over vast territories.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Woman's title deed to an equal share in the inheritance\r\n     left her by the fathers of the Republic has been examined and\r\n     proved by able lawyers; and,\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, This right is already exercised in some form in one\r\n     hundred localities in different parts of the world; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That sex is no longer considered a bar to the\r\n     exercise of suffrage by civilized nations.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the duty of Congress to pass a declaratory\r\n     act, compelling the several States to establish a \"republican\r\n     form of government\" within their borders by securing to women\r\n     their right to vote, thus nullifying the fraudulent Acts of\r\n     Legislatures and making our Government homogeneous from Maine to\r\n     Oregon.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the question of enfranchising one-half the\r\n     people is superior to that of Indian treaties, admission of new\r\n     States, tariff, international copyright or any other subject\r\n     before the country, and that it is the foremost duty of the\r\n     Fiftieth Congress at this, its last session, to submit an\r\n     amendment to the Constitution forbidding States to disfranchise\r\n     citizens on account of sex.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That as a question of ethics the difference between\r\n     putting a fraudulent ballot in the box and keeping a rightful\r\n     ballot out is nothing, and that we condemn the action which\r\n     prevents women from casting a ballot at any election as a\r\n     shameful evidence of the corruption of dominant political parties\r\n     in this country.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The Legislature of Washington Territory has twice voted\r\n     for woman suffrage--women for the most part having gladly\r\n     accepted and exercised the right, Governor Squire in his report\r\n     to the Secretary of the Interior in 1884 having declared that it\r\n     met the approval of a large majority of the people; and,\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, In 1887, after the women had voted for three and a half\r\n     years, the Territorial Supreme Court pronounced the law invalid\r\n     on the ground that the nature of the bill must be described in\r\n     the title of the act; and,\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, In January, 1888, another bill passed by the Legislature\r\n     gave to this law an explicit title; and the bill, again granting\r\n     suffrage to women, was signed by Governor Semple, thus\r\n     triumphantly showing the approval of the people, the Legislature\r\n     and the Governor; and,\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The Territorial Supreme Court, in August, 1888, again\r\n     rendered a decision against the right of the women of the\r\n     Territory to vote, basing their decision upon the false\r\n     assumption that Congress had never delegated to the Territories\r\n     the right to define the status of their own voters; and,\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, This decision strikes a blow at the fundamental powers\r\n     of the United States Congress, confounding laws delegated to the\r\n     Territories by the Organic Act of 1852, which vests in their\r\n     Legislatures the power to prescribe their qualifications for\r\n     voting and holding office--with State governments which limit\r\n     legislative enactments by constitutions of their own making--thus\r\n     setting at naught the will of the people; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we earnestly and respectfully petition Congress\r\n     that in passing an enabling act or acts for the admission of the\r\n     other Territories there be incorporated a clause allowing women\r\n     to vote for delegates to their constitutional conventions, and at\r\n     the election for the adoption of the constitution, in every one\r\n     where the Legislature has granted woman suffrage and such law has\r\n     not been repealed by a subsequent Legislature.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, In the year 1873 our leader, Susan B. Anthony, was\r\n     deprived of the right of trial by jury, by a Judge of the Supreme\r\n     Court of the United States, simply because she was a woman, it is\r\n     the duty of all women to resent the insult thus offered to\r\n     womanhood and demand of the men of this closing century of\r\n     constitutional government such condemnation of this infamous\r\n     decision of Judge Ward Hunt[74] as shall teach the coming\r\n     generation of voters that the welfare of the republic demands\r\n     that women be protected equally with men in the exercise of\r\n     citizenship; and,\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, In the great Centennial Celebration of 1876 women were\r\n     denied all participation in the public proceedings commemorating\r\n     the birth of the Declaration of Independence, though they sought\r\n     earnestly and respectfully to declare their sentiments of loyalty\r\n     to the great principles of liberty and responsibility there\r\n     enunciated, they should now demand official recognition by\r\n     Congress and the State Legislature on all the Boards of\r\n     Commissioners which, at the public expense, are to initiate and\r\n     carry out the august ceremonials of the coming Constitutional\r\n     Celebration in New York in April, 1889, to the end that taxation\r\n     without representation shall no longer be acknowledged a just and\r\n     constitutional policy in this government nominally of the\r\n     _people_, therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That a committee be appointed by the National W. S.\r\n     A. to memorialize Congress on this subject, and to take such\r\n     other action as shall bring before the enlightened manhood of our\r\n     country their duty of chivalry no less than justice in this\r\n     important matter.[75]\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The question of woman's enfranchisement is fundamental\r\n     and of paramount importance; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That, while the National Woman Suffrage Association\r\n     welcomes and claims the support of persons of all parties and\r\n     beliefs, it desires to strongly reassert the position which it\r\n     has held of being nonpartisan.\r\n\r\nA hearing was granted by the Senate Committee on Woman Suffrage the\r\nmorning of January 24. Mrs. Hooker, Mrs. Minor, Mrs. Duniway, Mrs.\r\nJohns, the Rev. Olympia Brown, the Rev. Miss Shaw and Miss Alice Stone\r\nBlackwell were introduced to the committee by Miss Anthony, and each\r\nfrom a different standpoint presented the arguments for the submission\r\nof a Sixteenth Amendment enfranchising women.\r\n\r\nOn February 7, Senator Blair reported for the committee--Senators\r\nCharles B. Farwell (Ill.), Jonathan Chace (R. I.), Edward O. Wolcott\r\n(Col.), in favor of the amendment. After an able and exhaustive\r\nargument the report closed as follows:\r\n\r\n     Unless this Government shall be made and preserved truly\r\n     republican in form by the enfranchisement of woman, the great\r\n     reforms which her ballot would accomplish may never be; the\r\n     demoralization and disintegration now proceeding in the body\r\n     politic are not likely soon to be arrested. Corruption of the\r\n     male suffrage is already a well-nigh fatal disease; intemperance\r\n     has no sufficient foe in the law-making power; a republican form\r\n     of government can not survive half-slave and half-free.\r\n\r\n     The ballot is withheld from women because men are not willing to\r\n     part with one-half the sovereign power. There is no other real\r\n     cause for the continued perpetration of this unnatural tyranny.\r\n\r\n     Enfranchise women or this republic will steadily advance to the\r\n     same destruction, the same ignoble and tragic catastrophe, which\r\n     has engulfed the male republics of history. Let us establish a\r\n     government in which both men and women shall be free indeed. Then\r\n     shall the republic be perpetual.\r\n\r\nThe women of the nation are deeply indebted to Senator Blair for his\r\nable and persistent efforts in their behalf. Year after year, in the\r\nmidst of the great pressure of duties connected with his office, he\r\ncarefully prepared these constitutional and legal reports knowing that\r\nthey could have only the indirect results of educating public\r\nsentiment and contributing to the history of this great movement for\r\nthe political rights of half the race.\r\n\r\nThe other members of the committee, Senators Zebulon B. Vance (N. C.),\r\nJoseph E. Brown (Ga.), J. B. Beck (Ky.), announced that they should\r\npresent a minority report in opposition, but as \"Letters from a\r\nChimney Corner,\" by Mrs. Caroline F. Corbin, and \"The Law of Woman\r\nLife,\" by Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney, apparently had been exhausted, and as\r\nno other woman had provided them with the necessary ideas, the report\r\nnever materialized. Senator Vance, however, as chairman of this Select\r\nSuffrage Committee asked for a clerk at this time, to be paid out of\r\nthe contingent fund.\r\n\r\nThe House Judiciary Committee granted a hearing January 28, which was\r\naddressed by Miss Anthony, Mrs. Hooker, Mrs. Duniway, Mrs. Minor, the\r\nRev. Olympia Brown, Mrs. Colby, Miss Lavina A. Hatch (Mass.) and Mrs.\r\nElla M. Marble (Minn.). The committee took no action.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[73] It is a loss to posterity that Miss Shaw never writes her\r\naddresses. She is beyond question the leading woman orator of this\r\ngeneration, and is not surpassed in power by any of the men.\r\n\r\n[74] See History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. II, p. 647.\r\n\r\n[75] This was done, but no representation was allowed women in the\r\ncelebration.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER X.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL-AMERICAN CONVENTION OF 1890.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe winter of 1890 brought the usual crowd of eminent women to\r\nWashington to attend the Twenty-second national convention of the\r\nsuffrage association, February 18-21. As the president, Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nCady Stanton, was to start for Europe on the 19th, the congressional\r\nhearings took place previous to the convention and consisted only of\r\nher address. The Senate hearing on February 8 was held for the first\r\ntime in the new room set apart for the Select Committee on Woman\r\nSuffrage, but much objection was made because on account of its size\r\nonly a small audience could be admitted. Senators Vance, Farwell,\r\nBlair and John B. Allen of the new State of Washington were present.\r\nMrs. Stanton said in part:\r\n\r\n     For almost a quarter of a century a body of intelligent and\r\n     law-abiding women have held annual conventions in Washington and\r\n     made their appeals before committees of the House and the Senate,\r\n     asking to be recognized as citizens of this Republic. A whole\r\n     generation of distinguished members, who have each in turn given\r\n     us aid and encouragement, have passed away--Seward, Sumner,\r\n     Wilson, Giddings, Wade, Garfield, Morton and Sargent--with\r\n     Hamlin, Butler and Julian still living, have all declared our\r\n     demands just, our arguments unanswerable.\r\n\r\n     In consulting at an early day as to the form in which our claims\r\n     should be presented, some said by an amendment to the\r\n     Constitution, others said the Constitution as it is, in spirit\r\n     and letter, is broad enough to protect the rights of every\r\n     citizen under our flag. But when the war came and we saw that it\r\n     took three amendments to make the slaves of the South\r\n     full-fledged citizens, we thought it would take at least one to\r\n     make woman's calling and election sure. So we asked for a\r\n     Sixteenth Amendment. But learned lawyers, Judges and Congressmen\r\n     took the ground that women were already enfranchised by the\r\n     Fourteenth Amendment. The House minority report in 1871, signed\r\n     by Benjamin F. Butler and William Loughridge, held that view. It\r\n     is an able, unanswerable argument on the whole question, based on\r\n     the oft-repeated principles of the Republican party at that\r\n     time. It stands to-day a living monument of the grossest\r\n     inconsistencies of which the Republican party ever was\r\n     guilty.[76] ...\r\n\r\n     We can not play fast and loose with the eternal principle of\r\n     justice without being caught sooner or later in the net of our\r\n     own weaving. The legitimate results of the war have been all\r\n     frittered away by political maneuvering. While Northern statesmen\r\n     have made a football of the rights of 12,000,000 women as voters,\r\n     and by Supreme Court decisions driven them from the polls, why\r\n     arraign the men in the South for treating 1,000,000 freedmen in\r\n     the same way? Are the rights of that class of citizens more\r\n     sacred than ours? Are the violations of the fundamental\r\n     principles of our Government in their case more dangerous than in\r\n     ours?...\r\n\r\n     In addressing those who already enjoy the right of suffrage, one\r\n     naturally would suppose that it would not be necessary to enlarge\r\n     on the advantages of having a voice in deciding the laws and the\r\n     rulers under which one lives. And neither would it if each member\r\n     of this committee understood that woman's wants and needs are\r\n     similar to his own; that the cardinal virtues belong to her as\r\n     well as to him; that personal dignity, the power of\r\n     self-protection, are as important for her as for him; that woman\r\n     loves justice, equality, liberty, and wishes the right to give\r\n     her consent to the Government under which she lives, as much as\r\n     man does. Matthew Arnold says: \"The first desire of every\r\n     cultured mind is to take part in the great work of government.\"\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n     If we would rouse new respect for womanhood in the hearts of the\r\n     masses, we must place woman in a position to respect herself,\r\n     which she can never do as long as her political status is beneath\r\n     that of the most degraded, ignorant classes of men. To make women\r\n     the political equals of their sons, or even of their gardeners\r\n     and coachmen, would add new dignity to their position; and to\r\n     change our laws and constitutions in harmony with the new status\r\n     would have its influence on the large class of young men now\r\n     devoting themselves to the study of the law. Lord Brougham said\r\n     long ago that the Common Law of England for women, and all the\r\n     statutes based on such principles, were a disgrace to the\r\n     Christianity and civilization of the nineteenth century. Do you\r\n     think our sons can rise from such studies with a high ideal of\r\n     womanhood? And with what feelings do you suppose women themselves\r\n     read these laws, and the articles in the State constitutions,\r\n     rating them with the disreputable and feeble-minded classes? Can\r\n     you not understand the dignity, the pride, the new-born\r\n     self-respect which would thrill the hearts of the women of this\r\n     nation in their enfranchisement? It would elevate their sphere of\r\n     action and every department of labor in which they are occupied;\r\n     it would give new force to their words as teachers, reformers and\r\n     missionaries, new strength to their work as guardians of the\r\n     young, the wayward and the unfortunate. It would transform them\r\n     from slaves to sovereigns, crowned with the rights of\r\n     citizenship, with the ballot, that scepter of power, in their own\r\n     right hands....\r\n\r\n     If there are any who do not wish to vote, that is the strongest\r\n     reason for their enfranchisement. If all love of liberty has been\r\n     quenched in their souls by their degraded condition, the duties\r\n     of citizenship and the responsibility of self-government should\r\n     be laid upon them at once, for their pitiful indifference is\r\n     merely the result of their disfranchisement. Would that I could\r\n     awake in the minds of my countrywomen the full significance of\r\n     this demand for the right of suffrage; what it is to be queens in\r\n     their own right, intrusted with the power of self-government,\r\n     possessed of all the privileges and immunities of American\r\n     citizens....\r\n\r\n     Whoever heard of an heir apparent to a throne in the Old World\r\n     abdicating her rights because some conservative politician or\r\n     austere bishop doubted woman's capacity to govern? History\r\n     affords no such example. Those who have had the right to a throne\r\n     have invariably taken possession of it and, against intriguing\r\n     cardinals, ambitious nobles and jealous kinsmen, fought even to\r\n     the death to maintain the royal prerogatives which by inheritance\r\n     were theirs. When I hear American women, descendants of\r\n     Jefferson, Hancock and Adams, say they do not want to vote, I\r\n     feel that the blood of the revolutionary heroes must long since\r\n     have ceased to flow in their veins.\r\n\r\n     Suppose when the day dawned for Victoria to be crowned Queen of\r\n     England she had gone before the House of Commons and begged that\r\n     such terrible responsibilities might not be laid upon her,\r\n     declaring that she had not the moral stamina nor intellectual\r\n     ability for the position; that her natural delicacy and\r\n     refinement shrank from the encounter; that she was looking\r\n     forward to the all-absorbing duties of domestic life, to a\r\n     husband, children, home, to her influence in the social circle\r\n     where the Christian graces are best employed. Suppose with a\r\n     tremulous voice and a few stray tears in her blue eyes, her head\r\n     drooping on one side, she had said she knew nothing of the\r\n     science of government; that a crown did not befit a woman's brow;\r\n     that she had not the physical strength even to wave her nation's\r\n     flag, much less to hold the scepter of power over so vast an\r\n     empire; that in case of war she could not fight and hence could\r\n     not reign, as there must be force behind the throne, and this\r\n     force must be centered in the hand which governed. What would her\r\n     Parliament have thought? What would other nations have\r\n     thought?...\r\n\r\n     None of you would admit, honorable gentlemen, that all the great\r\n     principles of government which center round our theories of\r\n     justice, liberty and equality in favor of individual sovereignty\r\n     have not as yet produced as high a type of womanhood as has a\r\n     monarchy in the Old World. We have a large number of women as\r\n     well fitted as Victoria for the most responsible positions in the\r\n     Government, who could fill the highest places with equal dignity\r\n     and wisdom.\r\n\r\n     There is no subject more intensely interesting to men than the\r\n     science of government, and when their wives are intelligent on\r\n     all the questions it comprises they will be far more valuable\r\n     companions than they are to-day. Marriage means companionship, a\r\n     similarity of tastes and opinions, and where one of the parties\r\n     has no interest in or knowledge of those subjects most absorbing\r\n     to the other, the bonds of union necessarily are weakened. So\r\n     long as woman's thought is centered in personal and family\r\n     aggrandizement, her strongest influence will be used to keep\r\n     man's interest there also. The virtue of patriotism would be far\r\n     greater among men, their devotion to the public good far more\r\n     earnest, if the influences of home life were not continually\r\n     drawing them into a narrow selfishness.\r\n\r\n     Women naturally take no interest in questions where their\r\n     opinions have no weight, in a sphere of action from which they\r\n     are excluded. They are not supposed to know what is necessary for\r\n     the public good, hence how could they influence their husbands to\r\n     make that their first duty when in public life? But when women\r\n     are enfranchised their interest in the State will deepen. They\r\n     will see that the welfare of their own children depends as much\r\n     on the conditions of the outside world as on the environments of\r\n     their own homes. This settled discontent of women is exerting an\r\n     insidious influence which is undermining the very foundations of\r\n     the home as well as the State. We must rouse them to new hopes,\r\n     new ambitions, new aspirations, through the enjoyment of the\r\n     blessings of freedom and self-government.\r\n\r\n     Moreover, an active participation in the practical duties of\r\n     government by educated women would bring a new and needed element\r\n     to the State. We can not overestimate the influence women exert,\r\n     whether for good or ill, hence the immense importance of their\r\n     having right views on all questions of public interest and some\r\n     knowledge of the requirements of practical politics. But their\r\n     power to-day is wholly irresponsible and hence dangerous. Lay on\r\n     them the responsibility of legislating, with all the criticism\r\n     and odium of a constituency and a party, in case they make some\r\n     blunder, and you render them wiser in judgment and more\r\n     deliberate in action. To secure this large disfranchised class as\r\n     allies to one of the leading parties would be a wise measure for\r\n     that party and bring a new element of morality and intelligence\r\n     into the body politic. Women are now taking a more active part in\r\n     public affairs than ever before and, with political freedom,\r\n     always will be the reserved moral power to sustain great men in\r\n     their best endeavors.\r\n\r\nAn interesting conversation followed. Chairman Zebulon B. Vance (N.\r\nC.) asked Mrs. Stanton if women would be willing to go to war if they\r\nhad the ballot. She answered that they would decide whether there\r\nshould be war. He inquired whether women would not lose their refining\r\ninfluence and moral qualities if they engaged in men's work. She\r\nreplied that there would have to be a definition of \"men's work\" and\r\nthat she found the latter in many avocations, such as washing,\r\ncooking, and selling needles and tape, which might be considered the\r\nwork of women. \"The moral qualities,\" she said, \"are more apt to grow\r\nwhen a human being is useful, and they increase in the woman who helps\r\nto support the family rather than in the one who gives herself to\r\nidleness and fashionable frivolities. The consideration of questions\r\nof legislation, finance, free trade, etc., certainly would not degrade\r\nwoman, nor is her refinement so evanescent a virtue that it could be\r\nswept away by some work which she might do with her hands. Queen\r\nVictoria looked as dignified and refined in opening Parliament as any\r\nlady one ever had seen.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Susan B. Anthony, who was never so happy as when her beloved\r\nfriend was scoring a victory, said there would always be a division of\r\nlabor, in time of war as in time of peace. Women would do their share\r\nin the hospitals and elsewhere, and if they were enfranchised, the\r\nonly difference would be that they would be paid for their services\r\nand pensioned at the close of the war. Mrs. Colby reminded the\r\ncommittee that the report of the U. S. Commissioner of Labor showed\r\nthat the largest proportion of immoral women came from home life and\r\nthe more feminine occupations.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton drew from the chairman the admission that his wife wanted\r\nthe franchise, and he laughingly admitted that he had had the worst of\r\nthe discussion. Senator Allen expressed himself in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage, and Senator Charles B. Farwell said, \"The suffragists have\r\nlogic, argument, everything on their side.\"\r\n\r\nAnother heaping was granted by the Senate Committee, February 24, when\r\nthey were addressed by the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, Mrs. Sallie Clay\r\nBennett, Mrs. Virginia L. Minor and Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby.\r\n\r\nLater in the session Senator Henry W. Blair (N. H.) presented the\r\nmajority report of the Committee (No. 1576), the usual strong,\r\ndignified statement. It closed as follows: \"To deny the submission of\r\nthis joint resolution to the action of the Legislatures of the States\r\nis analogous to the denial of the right of justice in the courts. It\r\nis to say that no plaintiff shall bring his suit; no claimant of\r\njustice shall be heard; and whatever may be the result to the friends\r\nof woman suffrage when they reach the Legislatures of the States, it\r\nis, in our belief, the duty of Congress to submit the joint resolution\r\nand give them the opportunity to try their case.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton presented the same address before the House Judiciary\r\nCommittee, February 11, with the result that for the first time in\r\nhistory a majority House report in favor of a Sixteenth Amendment was\r\nsubmitted. It was presented by Lucien B. Caswell (Wis.) and said in\r\nconclusion: \"The disfranchisement of twelve millions of people, who\r\nare citizens of the United States, should command from us an immediate\r\naction. Since the women of this country are unjustly deprived of a\r\nright so essential to complete citizenship in a republic as the\r\nelective franchise, common justice requires that we should submit the\r\nproposition for a change in the fundamental law to the State\r\nLegislatures, where the correction can be made.\"[77]\r\n\r\nThe fiftieth birthday of Susan B. Anthony had been celebrated in New\r\nYork City in 1870 by a large number of prominent men and women, the\r\nfirst instance of the kind on record. It had been decided by her\r\nfriends that her seventieth birthday should receive a similar\r\nrecognition, but that it should be more national in character. The\r\narrangements were made by Mrs. May Wright Sewall and Mrs. Rachel\r\nFoster Avery, and on the evening of February 15 a distinguished\r\ncompany of two hundred sat around the banquet tables in the great\r\ndining-room of the Riggs House. Miss Anthony occupied the place of\r\nhonor, on her right Senator Blair and Mrs. Stanton, on her left Robert\r\nPurvis, Mrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker and Mrs. Sewall, who presided. In\r\naddition to the after-dinner speeches of these distinguished guests\r\nthere were clever and sparkling responses to toasts by the Rev. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw, Mrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage, Miss Phoebe W. Couzins, the\r\nRev. Frederick A. Hinckley, Representative J. A. Pickler (S. D.), Mrs.\r\nColby, Mrs. Stanton's two daughters--Mrs. Harriot Blatch and Mrs.\r\nMargaret Lawrence--Mrs. Laura Ormiston Chant of England, and others.\r\nMrs. Stanton began her address by saying: \"If there is one part of my\r\nlife which gives me more intense satisfaction than another, it is my\r\nfriendship of more than forty years' standing with Susan B. Anthony.\"\r\nThe key-note to Miss Anthony's touching response was struck in the\r\nopening sentence: \"The thing I most hope for is that, should I stay on\r\nthis planet twenty years longer, I still may be worthy of the\r\nwonderful respect you have manifested for me to-night.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the more than two hundred letters, poems and telegrams received\r\nwere those of George William Curtis, William Lloyd Garrison, John G.\r\nWhittier, George F. Hoar, Lucy Stone, Frances E. Willard, Speaker\r\nThomas B. Reed, Mrs. John A. Logan, Thomas W. Palmer, the Rev. Olympia\r\nBrown, Harriet Hosmer, Elizabeth Boynton Harbert, Alice Williams\r\nBrotherton, Charles Nordhoff, Frank G. Carpenter, U. S. Senator Henry\r\nL. Dawes, Neal Dow, Laura M. Johns, T. V. Powderly and Leonora M.\r\nBarry. Most of the prominent newspapers in the country contained\r\neditorial congratulations, and the _Woman's Tribune_ issued a special\r\nbirthday edition.\r\n\r\nThe convention opened in Metzerott's Music Hall, February 18, 1890,\r\ncontinuing four days. The feature of this occasion which will\r\ndistinguish it in history was the formal union of the National and the\r\nAmerican Associations under the joint name. For the past twenty-one\r\nyears two distinctive societies had been in existence, both national\r\nas to scope but differing as to methods. Negotiations had been in\r\nprogress for several years toward a uniting of the forces and, the\r\npreliminaries having been satisfactorily arranged by committees from\r\nthe two bodies,[78] the officers and members of both participated in\r\nthis national convention of 1890.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, the newly-elected president of the united\r\nsocieties, faced a brilliant assemblage of men and women as she arose\r\nto make the opening address. Having declared that in going to England\r\nas president of the National-American Association she felt more\r\nhonored than if sent as minister plenipotentiary of the United States,\r\nshe spoke to a set of resolutions which she presented to the\r\nconvention.[79] After reviewing the history of the movement for the\r\nrights of woman and naming some of its brilliant leaders she said:\r\n\r\n     For fifty years we have been plaintiffs in the courts of justice,\r\n     but as the bench, the bar and the jury are all men, we are\r\n     nonsuited every time. Some men tell us we must be patient and\r\n     persuasive; that we must be womanly. My friends, what is man's\r\n     idea of womanliness? It is to have a manner which pleases\r\n     him--quiet, deferential, submissive, approaching him as a subject\r\n     does a master. He wants no self-assertion on our part, no\r\n     defiance, no vehement arraignment of him as a robber and a\r\n     criminal. While the grand motto, \"Resistance to tyrants is\r\n     obedience to God,\" has echoed and re-echoed around the globe,\r\n     electrifying the lovers of liberty in every latitude and making\r\n     crowned heads tremble on their thrones; while every right\r\n     achieved by the oppressed has been wrung from tyrants by force;\r\n     while the darkest page on human history is the outrages on\r\n     women--shall men still tell us to be patient, persuasive,\r\n     womanly?\r\n\r\n     What do we know as yet of the womanly? The women we have seen\r\n     thus far have been, with rare exceptions, the mere echoes of men.\r\n     Man has spoken in the State, the Church and the Home, and made\r\n     the codes, creeds and customs which govern every relation in\r\n     life, and women have simply echoed all his thoughts and walked in\r\n     the paths he prescribed. And this they call womanly! When Joan of\r\n     Arc led the French army to victory I dare say the carpet knights\r\n     of England thought her unwomanly. When Florence Nightingale, in\r\n     search of blankets for the soldiers in the Crimean War, cut her\r\n     way through all orders and red tape, commanded with vehemence and\r\n     determination those who guarded the supplies to \"unlock the doors\r\n     and not talk to her of proper authorities when brave men were\r\n     shivering in their beds,\" no doubt she was called unwomanly. To\r\n     me, \"unlock the doors\" sounds better than any words of\r\n     circumlocution, however sweet and persuasive, and I consider that\r\n     she took the most womanly way of accomplishing her object.\r\n     Patience and persuasiveness are beautiful virtues in dealing with\r\n     children and feeble-minded adults, but those who have the gift of\r\n     reason and understand the principles of justice, it is our duty\r\n     to compel to act up to the highest light that is in them, and as\r\n     promptly as possible.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton urged that women should have more power in church\r\nmanagement, saying:\r\n\r\n     As women are taking an active part in pressing on the\r\n     consideration of Congress many narrow sectarian measures, such as\r\n     more rigid Sunday laws, the stopping of travel, the distribution\r\n     of the mail on that day, and the introduction of the name of God\r\n     into the Constitution; and as this action on the part of some\r\n     women is used as an argument for the disfranchisement of all, I\r\n     hope this convention will declare that the Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association is opposed to all union of Church and State, and\r\n     pledges itself as far as possible to maintain the secular nature\r\n     of our Government. As Sunday is the only day that the laboring\r\n     man can escape from the cities, to stop the street-cars,\r\n     omnibuses and railroad trains would indeed be a lamentable\r\n     exercise of arbitrary authority. No, no, the duty of the State is\r\n     to protect those who do the work of the world, in the largest\r\n     liberty, and instead of shutting them up in their gloomy tenement\r\n     houses on Sunday, to open wide the parks, horticultural gardens,\r\n     museums, libraries, galleries of art and the music halls where\r\n     they can listen to the divine melodies of the great masters.\r\n\r\nShe demanded that women declare boldly and decisively on all the vital\r\nissues of the day, and said:\r\n\r\n     In this way we make ourselves mediums through which the great\r\n     souls of the past may speak again. The moment we begin to fear\r\n     the opinions of others and hesitate to tell the truth that is in\r\n     us, and from motives of policy are silent when we should speak,\r\n     the divine floods of light and life flow no longer into our\r\n     souls. Every truth we see is ours to give the world, not to keep\r\n     for ourselves alone, for in so doing we cheat humanity out of\r\n     their rights and check our own development.\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Stanton finished she introduced her daughter, Mrs. Blatch, a\r\nresident of England, who in a few impressive remarks showed that on\r\nthe great socialistic questions of the day--capital and labor, woman\r\nsuffrage, race prejudice--England was liberal and the United States\r\nconservative; that the latter had beautiful ideas but did not apply\r\nthem, and tended too much to the worship of legislation.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Wm. Dudley Foulke, retiring president of the American\r\nAssociation, an uncompromising advocate of woman's enfranchisement,\r\nthen made a strong and scholarly address in the course of which he\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     The fundamental rights of self-government, the right of each man\r\n     to cast his single vote and have it counted as it is cast, is of\r\n     greater and more lasting importance than any of the temporary\r\n     consequences which flow from the result of any election. Beyond\r\n     all matters of expediency and good administration lies the great\r\n     question of human liberty and equality, which can only be\r\n     maintained by the uncorrupted equal suffrage of every citizen;\r\n     and so sacred is this in the eyes of the law that years of\r\n     penitentiary service are prescribed for the interference with the\r\n     right of a single human being of the male sex to cast the vote\r\n     which the law allows him.\r\n\r\n     But there may be a moral guilt outside the law, of a character\r\n     quite similar to that which is so punished when it comes within\r\n     the terms of the statute, and it may be the crime, not of a\r\n     single lawbreaker, but of the entire community that establishes\r\n     the constitutions and enacts the statutes, which denies these\r\n     equal rights to citizens who are subject to equal burdens.\r\n     Wherever the rule of power is substituted for the just and\r\n     equitable principle that all who are subject to government should\r\n     have a voice in controlling it, we are guilty under the form of\r\n     law of the same violation of the just rights of others for which\r\n     the corruptor of elections and the forger of tally-sheets is\r\n     tried, convicted and incarcerated. Yet from the remotest times\r\n     the world has done this thing, for equal rights have never been\r\n     conceded to women, and so warped are our convictions by custom\r\n     and prejudice that a denial of their political equality seems as\r\n     natural as the breath we draw....\r\n\r\n     Paternalism in government, which seeks to do good to the people\r\n     against their will, is wrong in the Czar of Russia and in old\r\n     King George, but is quite right and just when it affects only our\r\n     wives, sisters and daughters! They have everything they need, why\r\n     ask the ballot? Ah, my friends, so long as they have not the\r\n     right to determine the thing they need, so long as the ultimate\r\n     sovereignty remains with men to say what is good and what is bad\r\n     for them, they are deprived of that which we, as men, esteem the\r\n     most precious of all rights. I suppose there never was a time\r\n     when men did not believe that women had everything they ought to\r\n     want; that they had as much as was good for them. The woman must\r\n     obey in consideration of the kind protection which her lord\r\n     vouchsafes to her. The wife's property ought to belong to the\r\n     husband, because upon him the law casts the burden of sustaining\r\n     the family. There must be a ruler, and the husband ought to be\r\n     that one. But this is the same principle which, during thousands\r\n     of years, maintained the divine right of kings. When we apply it\r\n     to our system of suffrage the number of sovereigns is increased,\r\n     that is all. It is a recognition of the divine right of man to\r\n     legislate for himself and woman too. It is only a difference in\r\n     the number of autocrats and the manner in which their decrees are\r\n     promulgated....\r\n\r\n     By what argument can a man defend his own suffrage as a right and\r\n     not concede an equal right to woman? A just man ought to accord\r\n     to every other human being, even his own wife, the rights which\r\n     he demands himself.\r\n\r\n     \"But she has her sphere and she ought not go beyond it.\" My\r\n     friend, who gave you the right to determine what that sphere\r\n     should be? If nature prescribes it, nature will carry out her own\r\n     ordinances without your prohibitory legislation. I have the\r\n     greatest contempt for the sort of legislation which seeks to\r\n     enable nature to carry out her own immutable laws. I would have\r\n     very little respect for any decree, enacted with whatever\r\n     solemnity, which should prescribe that an object shall fall\r\n     towards the earth and not from it; and I have just as little\r\n     respect for any statute of man which enacts that women shall\r\n     continue to love and care for their children by shutting them out\r\n     from political action and preferment lest they should neglect the\r\n     duties of the household....\r\n\r\n     \"But,\" say you, \"woman is already adequately represented. She\r\n     does not form a separate class. She has no interests different\r\n     from those of her husband, brother or father.\" These arguments\r\n     have been used even by so eminent an authority as John Bright. Is\r\n     it indeed a fact? Wherever woman owns property which she would\r\n     relieve from unjust taxation; wherever she has a son whom she\r\n     would preserve from the temptations of intemperance, or a\r\n     daughter from the enticements of a libertine, or a husband from\r\n     the conscriptions of war, she has a separate interest which she\r\n     is entitled to protect.\r\n\r\n     \"But she can control legislation by her influence.\" If it were\r\n     proposed to take away our right to vote, we would think it a\r\n     satisfactory answer that our influence would still remain? If she\r\n     has influence she is entitled to that and her vote too. You have\r\n     no right to burn down a man's house because you leave him his\r\n     lot.\r\n\r\n     \"But woman does not want the suffrage.\" How do you know? have you\r\n     given her an opportunity of saying so? Wherever the right has\r\n     been accorded it has been generally exercised, and the best proof\r\n     of her wishes is the actual use which she makes of the ballot\r\n     when she has it. But it makes no difference whether all women\r\n     want to vote or whether most women want to vote, so long as there\r\n     is one woman who insists upon this simple right, the justice of\r\n     America can not afford to deny it....\r\n\r\nAt the close of Mr. Foulke's address Mrs. Stanton was obliged to leave\r\nin order to reach New York City in time for her steamer. The entire\r\naudience arose, the women waving handkerchiefs and the men joining in\r\nthree farewell cheers.\r\n\r\nOne splendid address followed another, morning and evening, while the\r\nafternoons were occupied with business meetings, and even here there\r\nwere many little speeches which were worthy of preservation. Among\r\nthem was one of Miss Anthony's, in which she said: \"If it is\r\nnecessary, I will fight forty years more to make our platform free for\r\nthe Christian to stand upon, whether she be a Catholic and counts her\r\nbeads, or a Protestant of the straightest orthodox sect, just as I\r\nhave fought for the rights of the 'infidels' the last forty years.\r\nThese are the principles I want to maintain--that our platform may be\r\nkept as broad as the universe, that upon it may stand the\r\nrepresentatives of all creeds and of no creeds--Jew and Christian,\r\nProtestant and Catholic, Gentile and Mormon, believer and atheist.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker (Conn.) discussed The Centennial of 1892,\r\ndemanding the recognition of women. Mrs. Mary Seymour Howell (N. Y.)\r\nspoke on the Present, the Destiny of To-day. Mrs. Ormiston Chant\r\n(Eng.) depicted the glory of The Coming Woman. Mrs. Carrie Chapman\r\nCatt made her first appearance on the national platform with an\r\naddress on The Symbol of Liberty, describing political conditions with\r\na keen knowledge of the facts and showing their need of the\r\nintelligence, morality and independence of women. The subject selected\r\nby Miss Phoebe W. Couzins, herself an office-holder, was Woman's\r\nInfluence in Official Government.\r\n\r\nHenry B. Blackwell made a strong speech on Woman Suffrage a Growth of\r\nCivilization. He read a letter from Lucy Stone, his wife, who was to\r\nhave spoken on The Progress of Women but was prevented by illness, in\r\nwhich she said: \"The time is full of encouragement for us. We look\r\nback to our small beginnings and over the many years of constant\r\nendeavor to secure for women the application of the principles which\r\nare the foundation of a representative government. Now we are a host.\r\nBoth Houses of Congress and the legislative bodies in nearly all the\r\nStates, have our questions before them. So has the civilized world.\r\nSurely at no distant day the sense of justice which exists in\r\neverybody will secure our claim, and we shall have at last a truly\r\nrepresentative government, of the people, by the people and for the\r\npeople. We may, therefore, rejoicing in what is already gained, look\r\nforward with hope to the future.\"\r\n\r\nA large audience listened to the address of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe on\r\nThe Chivalry of Reform, during which she said:\r\n\r\n     The political enfranchisement of woman has long been sought upon\r\n     the ground of abstract right and justice. This ground is surely\r\n     the soundest and safest basis for any claim to rest upon. But\r\n     mankind, after yielding a general obedience to the moral law,\r\n     will reserve for themselves a certain freedom in its application\r\n     to particular things. Even in so imperative a matter as the\r\n     salvation of their own souls they will not be content with\r\n     weights and measures. The touch of sentiment must come in,\r\n     uplifting what law knocks down, freeing what it trammels,\r\n     satisfying man's love for freedom by ministering to his sense of\r\n     beauty. When this subtle power joins itself to the demonstrations\r\n     of reason, the victory is sure and lasting.\r\n\r\n     It is in the grand order of these ideas that I stand here to\r\n     advocate the enfranchisement of my sex. Morally, socially,\r\n     intellectually equal with men, it is right that we should be\r\n     politically equal with them in a society which claims to\r\n     recognize and uphold one equal humanity. I do not say it is _our_\r\n     right. I say it is right--God's right and the world's.\r\n\r\n     In the name of high sentiment then, in the name of all that good\r\n     men profess, I ask that the gracious act may be consummated which\r\n     will admit us to the place that henceforth befits us, that of\r\n     equal participants with you in the sovereignty of the people. Do\r\n     this in the spirit of that mercy whose quality is not strained.\r\n     Remember that the neglect of justice brings with it the direst\r\n     retribution. Make your debt to us a debt of honor, and pay it in\r\n     that spirit; if you do not pay it, dread the proportions which\r\n     its arrears will assume. Remember that he who has the power to do\r\n     justice and refrains from doing it, will presently find it doing\r\n     itself, to his no small discomfiture....\r\n\r\n     Women, trained for the moral warfare of the time, armed with the\r\n     fine instincts which are their birthright, are not doomed to sit\r\n     forever as mere spectators in these great encounters of society.\r\n     They are to deserve the crown as well as to bestow it; to meet\r\n     the powers of darkness with the powers of light; to bring their\r\n     potent aid to the eternal conquest of right. And let me say here\r\n     to those women who not only hang back from this encounter but who\r\n     throw obstacles in the way of true reform and progress, that the\r\n     shallow ground upon which they stand is within the belt of the\r\n     moral earthquake, and that what they build upon it will be\r\n     overthrown....\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Miss Shaw, in an address filled with humor as well as logic,\r\ntreated of Our Unconscious Allies, among whom she included clergymen\r\nwho oppose equal suffrage, the women remonstrants with their weak\r\ndocuments, the colleges which try to keep out girls, and the many\r\ncases of outrage and wrong committed by \"our motherless Government.\"\r\nThe Rev. Olympia Brown replied to the question, Where is the Mistake?\r\nWith great power and earnestness she pointed out the mistakes made by\r\nour Government during the century of its existence and demanded the\r\ncorrection of the greatest one of all--the exclusion of women.\r\n\r\nThe address of Mrs. Zerelda G. Wallace (Ind.), A Whole Humanity,\r\naroused the universal sympathy and appreciation of the audience,\r\npermeated as it was with the spirit of love, charity and justice:\r\n\r\n     ....The animus of this movement for woman's freedom has been\r\n     mistaken in the idea that it meant competition between women and\r\n     men; to my thought it simply means co-operation in the work of\r\n     the world. The man is to bring the physical forces, and he has\r\n     done that work magnificently. I never go over this continent and\r\n     see what men have done, that I do not feel like bowing my head in\r\n     reverence to their wisdom, their strength, their power, and I\r\n     think the nearest thing we see to divinity is the incarnation of\r\n     the God-head in a grand good man.\r\n\r\n     But there are other forces which must be brought into subjection\r\n     to humanity before we reach the highest development, and those\r\n     are the moral and spiritual forces. That is woman's share\r\n     largely, not that I exempt man, but pre-eminently woman is the\r\n     teacher of the race; in virtue of her motherhood she is the\r\n     character builder; she forms the soul life; she rears the\r\n     generations. It is not part of woman's work to contend with man\r\n     for supremacy over the material forces. It was never told to\r\n     woman that she should earn her bread by the sweat of her brow.\r\n     That was man's curse. He was to earn his bread and woman's too,\r\n     if he faithfully performed his duty, and we are not \"dependents\"\r\n     even if he does that. I never allow a man to say in my presence\r\n     that he \"supports\" his wife, and I want every woman to take the\r\n     same position. I would correct any man and tell him he was\r\n     mistaken in his phraseology if he should say anything of that\r\n     kind. You have something different to do, my sisters. You shall\r\n     hate evil, was said to woman, and evil shall hate you. There\r\n     shall go forth from you an influence which shall ultimately\r\n     exterminate evil.... The men of this nation would never have made\r\n     the success they have in the material world, if some stronger\r\n     force had limited them on all sides.\r\n\r\n     I said a moment ago that I do not like the idea of dependence of\r\n     women on men, or the dependence of men on women. I do not like\r\n     the word independence, but I do like the word interdependence. It\r\n     is said of this beautiful country, \"United we stand, divided we\r\n     fall.\" It is the same with men and women. Men without women would\r\n     go back to barbarism, and women without men would be most\r\n     frivolous and vain. If we work not in competition but in\r\n     co-operation and harmony we shall bring the race to its ultimate\r\n     inheritance, which is rulership over the universe.\r\n\r\n     Now to deprive woman of the right to express her thought with\r\n     authority at the ballot-box in regard to the laws under which she\r\n     is governed, puts a mark of imbecility upon her at once. So far\r\n     as the Government is concerned we are held in perpetual tutelage,\r\n     we are minors always, and while good men will act justly towards\r\n     women, it is an excuse for every bad and foolish man to oppress\r\n     them, and every unfledged boy to make them the subject of\r\n     ridicule....\r\n\r\n     I believe the great majority of American men love our free\r\n     institutions; I believe they have hope and pride in the future of\r\n     this nation; but as sure as you live, every argument you use\r\n     against the enfranchisement of women deals a death-blow against\r\n     the fundamental principle which lies at the base of our\r\n     government, and it is treason to bring an argument against it.\r\n\r\n     Another thing which you permit is reacting now to the detriment\r\n     of our free institutions; if from prejudice or expediency you\r\n     think you have a right to withhold the ballot from the women of\r\n     this nation, you have but to go one step further and deprive any\r\n     other class of a right they already have, should you think it\r\n     expedient to do so. It is beginning to bear its fruit now in your\r\n     elections. You are becoming demoralized; ballots are bought and\r\n     sold; you have your blocks of five; and in some entire\r\n     communities the men are deprived of the right of suffrage. It is\r\n     simply a question of time how long you will be able to maintain\r\n     the freedom you cherish for yourselves.\r\n\r\n     If we women are citizens, if we are governed, if we are a part of\r\n     the people, according to the plain declarations of the\r\n     fundamental principles which underlie this nation, we are as much\r\n     entitled to vote as you, and you can not make an argument against\r\n     us that would not disfranchise yourselves.\r\n\r\n     I feel this phase of the question more acutely than any other\r\n     because I think from a fundamental standpoint the progress of the\r\n     race is bound up in republican institutions. It is not a question\r\n     of woman's rights, it is a question of human rights, of the\r\n     success or failure of these institutions, and the more highly\r\n     cultured a woman is the more deeply she feels this\r\n     humiliation....\r\n\r\n     I do not think it weakness to say that women love, and that love\r\n     predominates in their nature, because, my friends, love is the\r\n     only immortal principle in the universe. Love is to endure\r\n     forever. Faith will be swallowed up in knowledge after a while,\r\n     and hope in fruition, but love abides forever. It is peculiarly\r\n     an attribute of our feminine nature to love our offspring over\r\n     everything else; for them we would peril our lives; and for the\r\n     men of this nation, under our form of government, to say to us\r\n     that we shall not have the power which will enable us through\r\n     laws and legislation to decide the conditions which shall\r\n     surround them, and throw the mother love around these children\r\n     from the cradle to the grave, is an inhuman use of their\r\n     authority....\r\n\r\nThe Washington _Star_ said: \"If the first day of the convention was\r\nMrs. Stanton's, the rest have belonged to Miss Anthony, 'Saint Susan,'\r\nas her followers love to call her. As vice-president-at-large she\r\npresided over every session, and never was in better voice or more\r\nenthusiastic spirits. As she sat by the table clad in a handsome dress\r\nof black satin, she was the life and soul of the meetings.... She does\r\nnot make much noise with her gavel,[80] nor does she have to use it\r\noften, but she manages to keep the organization over which she\r\npresides in a state of order that puts to shame many a convention of\r\nthe other sex. Business is transacted in proper shape, and every\r\nimportant measure receives its due share of attention. There is no\r\nfilibustering. The speakers who have been invited to address the\r\nconvention are listened to with attention and interest. When speeches\r\nare on the program they are made. When resolutions are desired they\r\nare presented, discussed, rejected or adopted as the case may be....\r\nThere are no attempts to push through unsuitable measures in haste and\r\nwithout the necessary attention. If any of those who have not attended\r\nthe meetings of the association are of the opinion that serious\r\nbreaches of parliamentary usage are committed through ignorance or\r\nwith intent, they are laboring under a decided delusion.\"\r\n\r\nThe business meeting devoted to a discussion of Our Attitude toward\r\nPolitical Parties proved to be the most exciting of the series. Among\r\nthe speakers were Mr. Foulke, Mrs. Sewall, Mrs. Howe, Miss Blackwell,\r\nMrs. Blake, the Rev. Mr. Hinckley, Mrs. Alice M. A. Pickler, Mrs.\r\nEllen Sully Fray, Mr. Blackwell, Miss Shaw, Mrs. Martha McClellan\r\nBrown, the Rev. Mrs. Brown, Mrs. Martha E. Root and Miss Mary Desha.\r\nWithout exception the sentiment was in favor of keeping strictly aloof\r\nfrom all political alliances. It was pointed out that repeatedly the\r\npromises made by politicians were violated and the planks in the\r\nplatforms ignored; it was shown that the suffrage can be gained only\r\nthrough the assistance of men in all parties; and it was proved\r\nbeyond doubt that in the past, where members had allied themselves\r\nwith a political party it had injured the cause of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the speakers already mentioned Wm. Lloyd Garrison, Col.\r\nD. R. Anthony, Ellen Battelle Dietrick, Laura Clay, the Hon. J. A.\r\nPickler, Sallie Clay Bennett, Margaret W. Campbell, Laura M. Johns,\r\nFrances Ellen Burr, Frances Stuart Parker, Dr. Frances Dickinson and\r\nothers participated in the various discussions of the convention.\r\n\r\nA deep interest was felt in the pending woman suffrage amendment in\r\nSouth Dakota. The subject was presented by Representative and Mrs.\r\nPickler, national speakers were appointed to canvass the State and a\r\nfund of over $5,000 was eventually raised.\r\n\r\nTributes of respect were paid to Caroline Ashurst Biggs and Margaret\r\nBright Lucas of England, U. S. Senator Elbridge G. Lapham, Maria\r\nMitchell, the great astronomer, Prudence Crandall Philleo, Harriet\r\nWinslow Sewall, Amy Post, Wm. D. Kelley, M. C., Dinah Mendenhall,\r\nEmerine J. Hamilton, Amanda McConnell and other friends and supporters\r\nof woman suffrage who had passed away during the year.\r\n\r\nThe vote for officers of the united association, which was limited\r\nstrictly to delegates, stood as follows: For president, Elizabeth\r\nCady Stanton, 131; Susan B. Anthony, 90; scattering, 2: for\r\nvice-president-at-large, Susan B. Anthony, 213; scattering, 9.[81]\r\nRachel Foster Avery was elected recording secretary; Alice Stone\r\nBlackwell, corresponding secretary; Jane H. Spofford, treasurer; Lucy\r\nStone, chairman of the executive committee by unanimous vote; Eliza T.\r\nWard and the Rev. Frederick A. Hinckley, auditors. The Rev. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw was appointed national lecturer.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[76] See History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. II, p. 464.\r\n\r\n[77] The other members in favor of this report were Ezra B.

It was held in Albaugh's\r\nOpera House, Washington, beginning Sunday, February 22, and continuing\r\nfour days, an assemblage of the most distinguished women of the nation\r\nin many lines of work. Miss Frances E. Willard presided and the other\r\nofficers contributed to the success of the Council--Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony, vice-president; Mrs. May Wright Sewall, corresponding\r\nsecretary; Miss Mary F. Eastman, recording secretary; Mrs. M. Louise\r\nThomas, treasurer. Ten national organizations were represented by\r\nofficial delegates and forty sent fraternal delegates.\r\n\r\nThe Sunday services were conducted entirely by women, the Rev. Ida C.\r\nHultin giving the sermon from the text, \"For the earth bringeth forth\r\nfruit of herself; first the blade, then the ear, after that the full\r\ncorn in the ear.\" \"And I saw a new heaven and a new earth\". The\r\nprogram of the week included Charities, Education, Temperance,\r\nReligion, Organized Work, Political Status of Women, etc.[82] On\r\nSaturday evening Mrs. Jane H. Spofford gave a large reception at the\r\nRiggs House to the Council and the Suffrage Association. The latter\r\nheld its sessions February 26-March 1, occupying the same beautifully\r\ndecorated opera house which had been filled for four days by audiences\r\nin attendance at the Council, who kept on coming, scarcely knowing the\r\ndifference.\r\n\r\nThe Call for this convention expressed the great joy over the action\r\nof Congress during the past year in admitting Wyoming as a State with\r\nwoman suffrage in its constitution:\r\n\r\n     The admission of Wyoming into the Union as a State with equal\r\n     rights for women guaranteed in its organic law, not only sets a\r\n     seal of approval upon woman suffrage after a practical experience\r\n     of twenty-one years, but it makes woman a recognized factor in\r\n     national politics. Hereafter the Chief Executive and both Houses\r\n     of Congress will owe their election partly to the votes of women.\r\n     The injustice and absurdity of allowing women in one State to be\r\n     sovereign rulers, and across the line in every direction obliging\r\n     them to occupy the position of a subject class, taxed without\r\n     representation and governed without consent--and this in a nation\r\n     which by its Constitution guarantees equal rights to all the\r\n     States and equal protection to all their citizens--must soon be\r\n     manifest even to the most conservative and prejudiced. We\r\n     therefore congratulate the friends of woman suffrage everywhere\r\n     that at last there is one spot under the American flag where\r\n     equal justice is done to women. Wyoming, all hail; the first true\r\n     republic the world has ever seen!\r\n\r\nThe program attracted considerable attention from a design on the\r\ncover showing a woman yoked with an ox to the plow, and, looking down\r\nupon them a girl in a college cap and gown with the inscription,\r\n\"Above the Senior Wrangler,\" referring to the recent victory at\r\nCambridge University, England, by Philippa Fawcett, in outranking the\r\nmale student who stood highest in mathematics. The first session was\r\nopened by the singing of Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton Harbert's inspiring\r\nhymn, The New America. After a welcome by Mrs. Ella M. S. Marble,\r\npresident of the District W. S. A., Miss Anthony read the address of\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, who was in England, entitled, The\r\nDegradation of Disfranchisement, which said in part:\r\n\r\n     Disfranchisement is the last lingering shadow of the old spirit\r\n     of caste which always has divided humanity into classes of\r\n     greater or less inferiority, some even below certain animals that\r\n     were considered special favorites with Heaven. One can not\r\n     contemplate these revolting distinctions among mankind without\r\n     amazement and disgust. This spirit of caste which has darkened\r\n     the lives of millions through the centuries still lives. The\r\n     discriminations against color and sex in the United States are\r\n     but other forms of this same hateful spirit, still sustained by\r\n     our religion as in the past. It is the outgrowth of the false\r\n     ideas of favoritism ascribed to Deity in regard to races and\r\n     individuals, but which have their origin in the mind of man.\r\n     Banish the idea of divine authority for these machinations of the\r\n     human mind, and the power of the throne and the church, of a\r\n     royal family and an apostolic order of succession, of kings and\r\n     queens, of popes and bishops, and man's headship in the State,\r\n     the Church, and the Home will be heard of no more forever....\r\n\r\n     All men of intelligence appreciate the power of holding the\r\n     ballot in their own hands; of having a voice in the laws under\r\n     which they live; of enjoying the liberty of self-government.\r\n     Those who have known the satisfaction of wielding political\r\n     influence would not willingly accept the degradation of\r\n     disfranchisement. Yet men can not understand why women should\r\n     feel aggrieved at being deprived of this same protection, dignity\r\n     and power. This is the Gibraltar of our difficulties to-day. We\r\n     can not make men see that women feel the humiliation of their\r\n     petty distinctions of sex precisely as the black man feels those\r\n     of color. It is no palliation of our wrongs to say that we are\r\n     not socially ostracized as he is, so long as we are politically\r\n     ostracized as he is not. That all orders of foreigners also rank\r\n     politically above the most intelligent, highly-educated\r\n     women--native-born Americans--is indeed the most bitter drop in\r\n     the cup of our grief which we are compelled to swallow....\r\n\r\n     Again, the degradation of woman in the world of work is another\r\n     result of her disfranchisement. Some deny that, and say the\r\n     laboring classes of men have the ballot yet they are still\r\n     helpless victims of capitalists. They have the power and hold the\r\n     weapon of defense but have not yet learned how to use it. The\r\n     bayonet, the sword, the gun, are of no value to the soldier until\r\n     he knows how to wield them. Yet without the weapons of defense\r\n     what could individuals and nations do in time of war for their\r\n     own protection? The first step in learning to use a gun or a\r\n     ballot is to possess one....\r\n\r\n     Man has the prestige of centuries in his favor, with the force to\r\n     maintain it, and he has possession of the throne, which is\r\n     nine-tenths of the law. He has statutes and Scriptures and the\r\n     universal usages of society all on his side. What have women? The\r\n     settled dissatisfaction of half the race, the unorganized\r\n     protests of the few, and the open resistance of still fewer. But\r\n     we have truth and justice on our side and the natural love of\r\n     freedom and, step by step, we shall undermine the present form of\r\n     civilization and inaugurate the mightiest revolution the world\r\n     has ever witnessed. But its far-reaching consequences themselves\r\n     increase the obstacles in the way of success, for the selfish\r\n     interests of all classes are against us. The rulers in the State\r\n     are not willing to share their power with a class over whom as\r\n     equals they could never obtain absolute control, whose votes they\r\n     could not manipulate to maintain the present conditions of\r\n     injustice and oppression....\r\n\r\n     Again, the rulers in the church are hostile to liberty for a sex\r\n     supposed for wise purposes to have been subordinated to man by\r\n     divine decree. The equality of woman as a factor in religious\r\n     organizations would compel an entire change in church canons,\r\n     discipline, authority, and many doctrines of the Christian faith.\r\n     As a matter of self-preservation, the church has no interest in\r\n     the emancipation of woman, as its very existence depends on her\r\n     blind faith....\r\n\r\n     Society at large, based on the principle that might makes right,\r\n     has in a measure excluded women from the profitable industries of\r\n     the world, and where she has gained a foothold her labor is at a\r\n     discount. Man occupies the ground and holds the key to the\r\n     situation. As employer, he plays the cheap labor of a\r\n     disfranchised class against the employe, thus in a measure\r\n     undermining his independence, making wife and daughter in the\r\n     world of work the rivals of husband and father.\r\n\r\n     The family, too, is based on the idea of woman's subordination,\r\n     and man has no interest, as far as he sees, in emancipating her\r\n     from that despotism by which his narrow, selfish interests are\r\n     maintained under the law and religion of the country.\r\n\r\n     Here, then, is a fourfold bondage, so many cords tightly twisted\r\n     together, strong for one purpose. To attempt to undo one is to\r\n     loosen all.... To my mind, if we had at first bravely untwisted\r\n     all the strands of this fourfold cord which bound us, and\r\n     demanded equality in the whole round of the circle, while\r\n     perhaps, we should have had a harder battle to fight, it would\r\n     have been more effective and far shorter. Let us henceforth meet\r\n     conservatives on their own ground and admit that suffrage for\r\n     woman does mean political, religious, industrial and social\r\n     freedom--a new and a higher civilization....\r\n\r\n     Woman's happiness and development are of more importance than all\r\n     man's institutions. If constitutions and statute laws stand in\r\n     the way of woman's emancipation, they must be amended to meet her\r\n     wants and needs, of which she is a better judge than man possibly\r\n     can be. If church canons and scriptures do not admit of woman's\r\n     equal recognition in all the sacred offices, then they must be\r\n     revised in harmony with that idea. If the present family life is\r\n     necessarily based on man's headship, then we must build a new\r\n     domestic altar, at which the mother shall have equal dignity,\r\n     honor and power; and we do not propose to wait another century to\r\n     secure all this; the time has come....\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony, with an allusion to pioneer days, then introduced Lucy\r\nStone, who, amid much applause, said that, while this was the first\r\ntime she had stood beside Susan B. Anthony in a Washington suffrage\r\nconvention, she had stood beside her on more than one hard-fought\r\nbattle-field before many of those present were born. After sketching\r\nbriefly the progress of the last forty years and giving some trying\r\npersonal experiences, she said in conclusion: \"The vote will not make\r\na man of a woman, but it will enable her to demand and receive many\r\nthings which are hers by right; to do the things which ought to be\r\ndone, to prevent what ought not to be done. Women and men can help\r\neach other in making the world better. This is not an anti-man\r\nmovement, but an effort toward the highest good of the race. We can\r\ncongratulate ourselves upon what we have gained, but the root of the\r\nevil still remains--the root of disfranchisement. All organizations of\r\nwomen should join with us in pulling steadily at this deeply-planted\r\nand obstinate root.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker (Conn.) read an able paper on Woman in\r\nPolitics and Jurisprudence, in which she showed the necessity in\r\npolitics and in law of a combination of the man's and the woman's\r\nnature, point of view and distinguishing characteristics.\r\n\r\nThe second evening Mrs. Julia Ward Howe gave an address on The\r\nPossibilities of the American Salon, and the Rev. Anna Garlin Spencer\r\nconsidered The Democratic Principle. Mrs. Spencer pointed out that the\r\nreason why the advance in the specific line of woman suffrage had not\r\nbeen so great as in some other directions was because its advocates\r\nhad to contend with a reaction of disbelief in the democratic\r\nprinciple. In expressing her own faith in this principle she said:\r\n\"There are wisdom enough and virtue enough in this country to take\r\ncare of all its ignorance and wickedness. The difficulty is that the\r\naverage American citizen does not know that he wears a crown. And oh,\r\nthe pity of it, and the shame of it, when some of us women, who do\r\nfeel the importance of the duty of suffrage and who need no man to\r\nteach us patriotism, wish to help in this work that any man should say\r\nus nay!\"\r\n\r\nMiss Florence Balgarnie, who brought the greetings of a number of\r\ngreat English associations,[83] gave a comprehensive sketch of The\r\nStatus of Women in England. The Rev. Ida C. Hultin (Ills.) followed in\r\nan eloquent appeal that there should be no headship of either man or\r\nwoman alone, but that both should represent humanity; government is a\r\ndevelopment of humanity and if woman is human she has an equal right\r\nin that development. Mrs. Ellen Battelle Dietrick (Mass.) showed that\r\nthe present supremacy of men was a reaction from the former undue\r\nsupremacy of women, and brought out many historical points of deep\r\ninterest. Mrs. Josephine K. Henry spoke on The Kentucky Constitutional\r\nConvention, illustrating the terrible injustice of the laws of that\r\nState in regard to women and the vain efforts of the latter to have\r\nthem changed. The Rev. Frederick A. Hinckley (R. I.) lifted the\r\naudience to the delectable heights, taking as a text, \"Husband and\r\nWife are One.\" After illustrating the tendency of all nature and all\r\nscience toward unity and harmony, he said:\r\n\r\n     Humanity is the whole. Men alone are half a sphere; women alone\r\n     half a sphere; men and women together the whole of truth, the\r\n     whole of love, the whole of aspiration. We have come to recognize\r\n     this thought in nearly all the walks of life. We want to\r\n     acknowledge it in the unity of mankind. The central thought we\r\n     need in our creeds and in our lives is that of the solidarity and\r\n     brotherhood of the race. This movement derives its greatest\r\n     significance not because it opens a place here and there for\r\n     women; not because it enables women to help men; but because in\r\n     all the concerns of life it places man and woman side by side,\r\n     hand in hand, shoulder to shoulder, putting their best thought,\r\n     their finest feeling, their highest aspiration, into the work of\r\n     the world. This reflection gives us a lasting and sublime\r\n     satisfaction amid defeat and derision. Whatever of fortune or\r\n     misfortune befalls the Suffrage Association in the carrying on of\r\n     its work, this belief is the root which is calculated to sustain\r\n     and inspire us--that this movement is the next step in the\r\n     progress of the race towards the unification of humanity....\r\n\r\n     I look forward to the time when men and women, labor and capital,\r\n     all classes and all sections, shall work side by side with one\r\n     great co-operative spirit, the denizens of the world and the\r\n     keepers of human progress. When that time comes we may not have\r\n     reached the millennium but we shall be nearer to it. We shall\r\n     then together establish justice, temperance, purity of life, as\r\n     never has been done before. Earth's aspirations then shall grow\r\n     to events. The indescribable--that shall then be done.\r\n\r\nU. S. Senator Joseph M. Carey was introduced by Miss Anthony as \"the\r\nman who on the floor of Congress fought Wyoming's battle for\r\nStatehood.\" His address on Wyoming, the True Republic, was a leading\r\nfeature of the convention. He said in part:\r\n\r\n     On the tenth day of July last, the State of Wyoming was born and\r\n     the forty-fourth star took its place on the old flag. Never was\r\n     first-born more warmly welcomed, for not only had a commonwealth\r\n     been created, but the principle of equality of citizenship\r\n     without regard to sex had been fully recognized and incorporated\r\n     as a part of the constitution of the new State.\r\n\r\nThe adoption of a woman suffrage bill by the first Territorial\r\nLegislature was graphically described, and after relating the\r\nsubsequent efforts for its repeal, and its incorporation finally into\r\nthe State constitution, he told of the struggle in Congress and said:\r\n\r\n     While I would not make invidious distinctions by giving the names\r\n     of those in both branches of Congress who favored Wyoming's\r\n     admission, I wish to say that I was agreeably surprised to have\r\n     many of the ablest members, both in public and private, disclose\r\n     the fact that they firmly believed the time would come when women\r\n     would be permitted to exercise full political rights throughout\r\n     the United States. They rejoiced that an opportunity had\r\n     presented itself by which they could show they had no prejudice\r\n     or opposition in their hearts to women's exercising the rights of\r\n     citizenship.\r\n\r\nHe closed with the following strong argument for the enfranchisement\r\nof women:\r\n\r\n     Suffrage should be granted to women for two reasons: first,\r\n     because it will help women; and second, because it will promote\r\n     the interests of the State. Whatever doubt I may have entertained\r\n     in the past concerning either the first or second proposition,\r\n     has entirely disappeared. From the experiment made under my own\r\n     eyes I can state in all candor that suffrage has been a real\r\n     benefit to women. It gives them a character and standing which\r\n     they would not otherwise possess. It does not lower a woman to be\r\n     consulted about public affairs, but is calculated to make her\r\n     more intelligent and thoughtful in matters that concern her own\r\n     household, especially in bringing up her sons and daughters. It\r\n     increases her interest in those things which concern the great\r\n     body of the people. Men in office and out of office, particularly\r\n     those who expect to serve the public, are compelled to be more\r\n     considerate of her wishes, and more desirous of doing those\r\n     things which will secure her approval. The greater the number of\r\n     persons living under a government who are interested in the\r\n     administration of its affairs, its well-being and the perpetuity\r\n     of its institutions, the stronger the government and the more\r\n     difficult it will be to compass its overthrow....\r\n\r\n     We frequently hear it said that women will not vote if they have\r\n     the opportunity; or, if permitted to vote, such an inconsiderable\r\n     number will exercise the privilege that it will not be worth\r\n     while to encumber the electoral system by granting it. In all\r\n     matters in which women have an interest, as large a percentage\r\n     vote as of the other sex. They have the same interest in all\r\n     which pertains to good government. They have exercised the\r\n     privilege of voting not in a careless and indifferent manner but\r\n     in a way reflecting credit on their good sense and judgment.\r\n\r\n     I know women who have exercised the fullest political rights for\r\n     a period of more than twenty years. They have taken the deepest\r\n     interest in the political affairs of the Territory and young\r\n     State. Neither in their homes nor in public places have they lost\r\n     one womanly quality; but their minds have broadened and they\r\n     have become more influential in the community in which they live.\r\n     During these years I have never heard of any unhappiness brought\r\n     into the home on account of women's exercising their political\r\n     rights. A fair and unbiased test of this question has been made\r\n     by the people of Wyoming, and no unprejudiced man or woman who\r\n     has seen its workings, can now raise a single honest objection.\r\n     Where women have voted, the family relation has not been\r\n     destroyed, men have loved them none the less, the mountains have\r\n     not been shaken from their foundations, nor have social\r\n     earthquakes or political convulsions taken place....\r\n\r\n     In order that women shall be more influential citizens of the\r\n     State and better qualified to raise noble men and women to fight\r\n     the battles of life, and to carry out the true purpose of this\r\n     republic, they must possess the full rights of citizenship.\r\n\r\nAt the close of his speech the Senator was presented with a large\r\nbasket of roses from the delegates.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lillie Devereux Blake (N. Y.) spoke on The Right of a Citizen to\r\na Trial by a Jury of His Peers, showing that women never have\r\npossessed this right; that in many criminal cases, such as seduction\r\nand infanticide, women could better understand the temptations than\r\ncould men; that the feminine heart, the maternal influence, are needed\r\nin the court-room as well as in the home. Mrs. Lida A. Meriwether\r\n(Tenn.) spoke in a keen, sarcastic but humorous manner of The Silent\r\nSeven, \"the legally mute\"--minors, aliens, paupers, criminals,\r\nlunatics, idiots and women.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Anna Howard Shaw took for her subject Women vs. Indians, and\r\nreviewed the suffrage amendment campaign in South Dakota the previous\r\nyear. In an address brimming and bubbling over with wit, satire and\r\npathos, she showed how much greater consideration the Indians received\r\nfrom the men of that State than did women. She told how 45 per cent.\r\nof the votes cast the preceding year were for male Indian suffrage and\r\nonly 37 per cent. for woman suffrage; how Indians in blankets and\r\nmoccasins were received in the State convention with the greatest\r\ncourtesy, and Susan B. Anthony and other eminent women were barely\r\ntolerated; how, while these Indians were engaged in their ghost\r\ndances, the white women were going up and down the State pleading for\r\nthe rights of citizens; how the law in that State gives not only the\r\nproperty but the children to the husband, in the face of all the\r\nhardships endured by those pioneer wives and mothers. She suggested\r\nthat the solution of the Indian question should be left to a\r\ncommission of women with Alice Fletcher at its head, and said in\r\nclosing: \"Let all of us who love liberty solve these problems in\r\njustice; and let us mete out to the Indian, to the negro, to the\r\nforeigner, and to the woman, the justice which we demand for\r\nourselves, the liberty which we love for ourselves. Let us recognize\r\nin each of them that One above, the Father of us all, and that all are\r\nbrothers, all are one.\"\r\n\r\nThe Moral and Political Emergency was presented by Mrs. Emma Smith\r\nDeVoe (S. D.). Henry B. Blackwell and Mrs. Alice M. A. Pickler\r\ndescribed the South Dakota Campaign. Representative J. A. Pickler was\r\nintroduced by Miss Anthony as the candidate who, when told that if he\r\nexpressed his views on woman suffrage he would lose votes, expressed\r\nthem more freely than ever and ran ahead of his ticket; and his wife\r\nas the woman who bade her husband to speak even if it lost him the\r\noffice, and who was herself the only Congressman's wife that ever took\r\nthe platform for the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clara Bewick Colby took for her subject Ibsen's drama, A Doll's\r\nHouse, and discussed its ethical problems, closing with the sentence:\r\n\"As long as the fighting qualities of woman remain, there is a chance\r\nfor the nation to make a robust, steady progress; but if these die out\r\nand woman willingly surrenders herself for the sake of selfish ease to\r\nthe dominance of man, civilization is arrested and true manhood\r\nbecomes impossible.\" The convention ended with a scholarly address by\r\nWm. Lloyd Garrison (Mass.) on The Social Aspect of the Woman Question.\r\n\r\nThe present officers were re-elected. Mrs. Lucia E. Blount (D. C.),\r\nchairman of the committee appointed to push the claim of Anna Ella\r\nCarroll, reported that a great deal of work had been done by Mr. and\r\nMrs. Melvin A. Root of Michigan, Mrs. Colby and herself. Every\r\npossible effort had been made but the prospect was that Congress would\r\ndo nothing for Miss Carroll. Miss Frances E. Willard brought an\r\ninvitation from Mrs. Harrison to the National Council of Women and the\r\nmembers of all its auxiliary societies to attend a reception at the\r\nWhite House, which was accepted by the convention. Mrs. Ellen M.\r\nHenrotin presented in the name of Mrs. Bertha Honoré Palmer an\r\nofficial invitation to the association to meet in Chicago during the\r\nColumbian Exposition, promising a hall which would seat five thousand.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony announced that she had engaged permanent headquarters for\r\nthe association in the Wimodaughsis club building, which action was\r\nratified. It was decided to give especial attention to suffrage work\r\nin the Southern States during the year. The wives of the two senators\r\nfrom Wyoming, Mrs. Warren and Mrs. Carey, occupied seats on the\r\nplatform.\r\n\r\nMrs. Blake reported the work done by the Platform Committee in having\r\nsuffrage resolutions endorsed by a large number of Labor Unions. Miss\r\nSara Winthrop Smith had been equally successful in Granges and\r\nbranches of the Knights of Labor. Dr. Frances Dickinson, Dr. Lucy\r\nWaite, Mrs. Corinne S. Brown and Mrs. Colby had visited the National\r\nConvention of Locomotive Engineers and secured the endorsement of a\r\nsuffrage petition. They obtained also the cordial approval of T. V.\r\nPowderly and the Knights of Labor, and of Samuel Gompers and the\r\nFederation of Labor. The Illinois Trade and Labor Assembly endorsed\r\ntheir petition. All of these bodies circulated suffrage petitions\r\namong their members, as also did the Illinois Farmers' Mutual Benefit\r\nAssociation and the Grand Army Posts, a number of which were reported\r\nas heartily recommending the enfranchisement of women. Signatures\r\nrepresenting millions of voters were thus obtained.[84]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the resolutions adopted by the convention bearing\r\ndirectly on suffrage, there was a demand for women on school boards\r\nand as physicians, matrons and managers in all public institutions\r\ncontaining women and children; and for a revision of the laws on\r\nmarriage and property.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday afternoon a great audience assembled for the closing\r\nexercises. The sermon was given by the Rev. Caroline J. Bartlett from\r\nthe text, \"The night is far spent, the day is at hand.\" It had been\r\nsaid on the preceding Sunday that the sermon of Miss Hultin could not\r\nbe equalled. The verdict now was that the honors must be evenly\r\ndivided.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[82] A complete report of the able addresses made by specialists in\r\nthese subjects was prepared by the new corresponding secretary, Mrs.\r\nRachel Foster Avery, and placed by Miss Anthony in the large libraries\r\nof the country.\r\n\r\n[83] The Central National Society for Women's Suffrage; the Women's\r\nFranchise Leagues of Edinburgh, Glasgow, Bedford, Bridgeport,\r\nLeicester, Nottingham and York; the Bristol Woman's Temperance\r\nAssociation; the International Arbitration and Peace Society; the\r\nWoman Councillors' Society; the Women's Federal Association of Great\r\nBritain.\r\n\r\n[84] The funds necessary for this work were furnished by J. W.\r\nHedenberg of Chicago, who also made a personal appeal to many of these\r\nbodies; but he claimed possession of the petitions, and for some\r\nreason never permitted them to be presented to Congress.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XII.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL-AMERICAN CONVENTION AND HEARINGS OF 1892.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Twenty-fourth annual woman suffrage convention, held in the Church\r\nof Our Father, Washington, D. C., Jan. 17-21, 1892, was preceded by\r\nthe usual services at three o'clock on Sunday afternoon. The text of\r\nthe sermon, by the Rev. Mila Tupper, was \"Think on these things\" and\r\nit was devoted to a lofty consideration of \"success through the moral\r\npower of ideals.\" Unexpectedly the congressional hearings were set for\r\nMonday morning, which called to the Capitol both Mrs. Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton and Miss Susan B. Anthony, president and vice-president of the\r\nassociation. The convention was called to order by the Rev. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw, and Mrs. Caroline McCullough Everhard (O.) was made\r\nchairman _pro tem_. Twenty-six States were represented by seventy-six\r\ndelegates, the reports showed a year of unprecedented activity and\r\nthere were requests from every State for speakers and organizers. The\r\ntreasurer reported receipts for the past year, $3,830.\r\n\r\nThe executive sessions throughout the convention were spirited and\r\ninteresting. After some discussion it was decided to carry the work\r\ninto the Southern States, and also to appropriate money and workers\r\nfor Kansas, where it was likely that an amendment for full suffrage\r\nsoon would be submitted. It was voted to accept the space offered at\r\nthe Columbian Exposition, to furnish and decorate a booth, circulate\r\nliterature, etc. The motion to have the next meeting in Chicago during\r\nthe Fair renewed the question of holding alternate conventions in some\r\nother city besides Washington, but the measure was defeated.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stanton introduced a resolution in favor of keeping the World's\r\nFair open on Sunday, which was advocated and opposed with great\r\nearnestness. The majority of opinion evidently was in favor of opening\r\nthe gates on Sunday but many felt that the subject was not germane to\r\nthe purposes of the association, while others were conscientiously\r\nopposed to Sunday opening. Finally, in the midst of the controversy\r\nMrs. Stanton withdrew her resolution, saying that she had offered it\r\nlargely for the sake of discussion. Miss Shaw presented a resolution\r\nopposing the sale of intoxicating liquor on the Fair Grounds, saying\r\nthat she did so as a matter of conscience and in order that it might\r\ngo on record. It was voted to call an international suffrage meeting\r\nat Chicago during the Columbian Exposition. Miss Anthony urged more\r\nsystematic organization, special efforts with the Legislatures, the\r\nsecuring of a Woman's Day at all Chautauqua Assemblies, county fairs,\r\ncamp meetings, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the earnest request of Mrs. Stanton, who had now reached the age of\r\nseventy-six, she was permitted to retire from the presidency, and Miss\r\nAnthony, aged seventy-two, was elected in her place. The Rev. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw was made vice-president-at-large. Lucy Stone, who was now\r\nseventy-four, begged to be released as chairman of the executive\r\ncommittee, which was then abolished, the duties being transferred to\r\nthe business committee consisting of all the officers of the\r\nassociation. Mrs. Stanton and Mrs. Stone were made honorary\r\npresidents.\r\n\r\nThis was Mrs. Stanton's last appearance at a national convention after\r\nan attendance of forty years, but she never failed to take an active\r\ninterest in the proceedings and to send her speech to be read by Miss\r\nAnthony. This also was the last time Lucy Stone appeared upon the\r\nnational platform, as she died the next year, and Miss Anthony alone,\r\nof this remarkable trio of women, was left to carry forward the great\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe addresses of this convention were up to the high standard of those\r\nwhich had preceded them during the past years, and no organization in\r\nexistence, of either men or women, can show a more brilliant record of\r\noratory. As Mrs. Stanton, Lucy Stone and Miss Anthony came on the\r\nplatform the first evening they were enthusiastically applauded. The\r\nmental and physical vigor of Mrs. Stanton was much commented upon as\r\nin a rich and resonant voice she read the speech which she had that\r\nmorning delivered before the Judiciary Committee of the House. It was\r\nentitled The Solitude of Self, and is considered by many to be her\r\nmasterpiece.\r\n\r\nLucy Stone discussed The Outlook with clear vision. She contrasted the\r\nwoman of the past, her narrow life, her limited education, her\r\ninferior position, with the educated, ambitious, independent woman of\r\nto-day, and urged that the latter should be equal to her\r\nopportunities, lay aside all frivolous things and labor unceasingly to\r\nsecure for her sex an absolute equality of civil and political rights.\r\n\r\nIn the half-humorous address of Mrs. Caroline Hallowell Miller (Md.)\r\non The Golden Rule, she said:\r\n\r\n     I am firmly convinced that our present powerless--I may almost\r\n     say ignominious--position arises not so much, as many aver, from\r\n     the lukewarmness of our own sex as from the supreme and absolute\r\n     indifference of men. With a few honorable exceptions, men do not\r\n     care one iota whether we vote or not....\r\n\r\n     Now if only men would take to betting on this question of woman\r\n     suffrage, if we could open it up as a field of speculation, if we\r\n     could manipulate it by some sort of patent process into stocks or\r\n     bonds and have it introduced into Wall Street, we should very\r\n     soon find ourselves emancipated. I keep on hoping that, by some\r\n     fortuitous chance, fate may eventually execute for us as\r\n     brilliant a _coup d'etat_ as did General Butler for the colored\r\n     slaves when he made them contraband of war, so that we shall just\r\n     tumble into freedom as they did very soon thereafter. Until then\r\n     let us trust in God, keep our powder very dry and our armies well\r\n     drilled and disciplined.\r\n\r\nIn an inspiring address on The True Daughters of the Republic, Mme.\r\nClara Neymann (N. Y.) pointed out the splendid material progress of\r\nour country under the guidance of men, and urged that women should be\r\nthe power to lift it up to an equally exalted spiritual plane. The\r\npaper of Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby (D. C.) on Wyoming, in which as a\r\nTerritory women had voted for twenty years and as a State for two\r\nyears, presented a most convincing array of statistics proving the\r\nbenefits of equal suffrage. Ex-Governor John W. Hoyt of Wyoming came\r\nto the platform and corroborated these statements, paying a fine\r\ntribute to the political influence of women. He was followed by Mrs.\r\nLida A. Meriwether (Tenn.), whose reputation as a humorist was fully\r\nsustained in her clever portrayal of Dreams that Go by Contraries.\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt (N. Y.) gave a brilliant address on The\r\nMission of a Republic.\r\n\r\nIn discussing The Value of Organizations for Women, Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nLyle Saxon (La.) said:\r\n\r\n     Among the various organizations of women the suffrage society\r\n     must rank first, for its demands have reached out and embraced\r\n     every reform which comes under the head of right, justice or\r\n     charity; and I am firmly persuaded that if the demand for the\r\n     ballot, the full right of citizenship, had not been made the\r\n     foundation of all other advantages, our organization would have\r\n     fallen apart and drifted into the more conservative and popular\r\n     lines along which less courageous women have successfully\r\n     worked....\r\n\r\n     Financial independence has been gained by many women, who, proud\r\n     of their own success, never try to benefit others, and fail to\r\n     comprehend the debt they owe to the brave, unselfish ones who\r\n     first made demands for them and who never ceased their efforts\r\n     until one after another the barriers were removed and\r\n     opportunities secured for thousands which they never could have\r\n     found themselves. It was this stanch band of pioneers, defying\r\n     criticism, scorn and hate, who forced open college doors, invaded\r\n     the law courts and stubbornly contested every inch of ground so\r\n     persistently held by fraud or force from the daughters of the\r\n     great republic....\r\n\r\n     Organized as women now are, they could pour such an overwhelming\r\n     moral influence into the political life of the country as to\r\n     become its saving grace; for when women vote they will show good\r\n     men, who have weakly shrunk from political duty, that they have a\r\n     moral and clean constituency to stand with them.\r\n\r\nThe platform proceedings of the convention closed with Miss Shaw's\r\nsplendid delineation of The Injustice of Chivalry.\r\n\r\nEvery suffrage convention for the last twelve years had been preceded\r\nby a handsome reception at the Riggs House. This well-known and\r\ncommodious hotel had been the convention headquarters, and it also had\r\nbeen the winter home of Miss Anthony, where she remained as a guest of\r\nthe proprietor, C. W. Spofford, and his wife, being thus enabled to do\r\na vast amount of congressional and political work, such as never has\r\nbeen done since. The hotel now had passed into other hands and the\r\nWashington _Post_, in speaking of this matter, said: \"The delegates\r\nfeel like lost sheep without Mrs. Spofford's hospitality at the Riggs\r\nHouse, which has always been headquarters for suffragist and all\r\nwomen's conventions. Probably no one but those in the inner circle\r\nwill ever know just how much Mrs. Spofford has done for the\r\nadvancement of women in every direction. Whatever was hers was at the\r\ndisposal of the leaders, and in the absence of so much assistance it\r\nis appreciated more nearly at its real worth.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. ELIZABETH CADY STANTON.\r\n\r\nHonorary President of National-American Woman Suffrage Association.]\r\n\r\nThe new club house of Wimodaughsis was opened for a reception to the\r\ndelegates by the District W. S. A., with Miss Anthony, Lucy Stone,\r\nMrs. Stanton, Henry B. Blackwell, and Miss Shaw, president of\r\nWimodaughsis, as guests of honor. All made clever little speeches\r\ntoward the close of the evening, which were supplemented with remarks\r\nby Senator Joseph M. Carey (Wy.), Representatives J. A. Pickler (S.\r\nD.), Martin N. Johnson (N. D.) and the Rev. Dr. Corey of the\r\nMetropolitan church.\r\n\r\nThe hearing on January 17 was held for the first time before a\r\nJudiciary Committee of the House, the majority of which was\r\nDemocratic.[85] The Washington _Star_ said: \"The new members of the\r\ncommittee were apparently surprised at receiving such a talk from a\r\nwoman and there was the most marked attention on the part of every one\r\npresent. Their surprise was still greater when they found that Mrs.\r\nStanton was not a phenomenal exception, but that every woman there\r\ncould make an argument which would do credit to the best of public\r\nmen.\"\r\n\r\nThe hearing before the Senate Committee on Woman Suffrage was held the\r\nmorning of February 20. Four of the greatest women this nation ever\r\nproduced addressed this committee, asking for themselves and their sex\r\na privilege which is freely granted without the asking to every man,\r\nno matter how humble, how ignorant, how unworthy, who is not included\r\nwithin the category of the insane, the idiotic, the convicted\r\ncriminal--Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Susan B. Anthony, Lucy Stone,\r\nIsabella Beecher Hooker. Mrs. Stanton (N. Y.) gave her address, The\r\nSolitude of Self, in place of the old arguments so many times\r\nrepeated, saying in part:\r\n\r\n     The point I wish plainly to bring before you on this occasion is\r\n     the individuality of each human soul--our Protestant idea, the\r\n     right of individual conscience and judgment--our republican idea,\r\n     individual citizenship. In discussing the rights of woman, we are\r\n     to consider, first, what belongs to her as an individual, in a\r\n     world of her own, the arbiter of her own destiny, an imaginary\r\n     Robinson Crusoe with her woman Friday on a solitary island. Her\r\n     rights under such circumstances are to use all her faculties for\r\n     her own safety and happiness.\r\n\r\n     Secondly, if we consider her as a citizen, as a member of a\r\n     great nation, she must have the same rights as all other\r\n     members, according to the fundamental principles of our\r\n     Government.\r\n\r\n     Thirdly, viewed as a woman, an equal factor in civilization, her\r\n     rights and duties are still the same--individual happiness and\r\n     development.\r\n\r\n     Fourthly, it is only the incidental relations of life, such as\r\n     mother, wife, sister, daughter, which may involve some special\r\n     duties and training. In the usual discussion in regard to woman's\r\n     sphere, such men as Herbert Spencer, Frederick Harrison and Grant\r\n     Allen uniformly subordinate her rights and duties as an\r\n     individual, as a citizen, as a woman, to the necessities of these\r\n     incidental relations, some of which a large class of women never\r\n     assume. In discussing the sphere of man we do not decide his\r\n     rights as an individual, as a citizen, as a man, by his duties as\r\n     a father, a husband, a brother or a son, some of which he may\r\n     never undertake. Moreover he would be better fitted for these\r\n     very relations, and whatever special work he might choose to do\r\n     to earn his bread, by the complete development of all his\r\n     faculties as an individual. Just so with woman. The education\r\n     which will fit her to discharge the duties in the largest sphere\r\n     of human usefulness, will best fit her for whatever special work\r\n     she may be compelled to do.\r\n\r\n     The isolation of every human soul and the necessity of\r\n     self-dependence must give each individual the right to choose his\r\n     own surroundings. The strongest reason for giving woman all the\r\n     opportunities for higher education, for the full development of\r\n     her faculties, her forces of mind and body; for giving her the\r\n     most enlarged freedom of thought and action; a complete\r\n     emancipation from all forms of bondage, of custom, dependence,\r\n     superstition; from all the crippling influences of fear--is the\r\n     solitude and personal responsibility of her own individual life.\r\n     The strongest reason why we ask for woman a voice in the\r\n     government under which she lives; in the religion she is asked to\r\n     believe; equality in social life, where she is the chief factor;\r\n     a place in the trades and professions, where she may earn her\r\n     bread, is because of her birthright to self-sovereignty; because,\r\n     as an individual, she must rely on herself....\r\n\r\n     To throw obstacles in the way of a complete education is like\r\n     putting out the eyes; to deny the rights of property is like\r\n     cutting off the hands. To refuse political equality is to rob the\r\n     ostracized of all self-respect, of credit in the market place, of\r\n     recompense in the world of work, of a voice in choosing those who\r\n     make and administer the law, a choice in the jury before whom\r\n     they are tried, and in the judge who decides their punishment.\r\n     Shakespeare's play of Titus and Andronicus contains a terrible\r\n     satire on woman's position in the nineteenth century--\"Rude men\r\n     seized the king's daughter, cut out her tongue, cut off her\r\n     hands, and then bade her go call for water and wash her hands.\"\r\n     What a picture of woman's position! Robbed of her natural rights,\r\n     handicapped by law and custom at every turn, yet compelled to\r\n     fight her own battles, and in the emergencies of life to fall\r\n     back on herself for protection....\r\n\r\n     How the little courtesies of life on the surface of society,\r\n     deemed so important from man towards woman, fade into utter\r\n     insignificance in view of the deeper tragedies in which she must\r\n     play her part alone, where no human aid is possible!\r\n\r\n     Nothing strengthens the judgment and quickens the conscience like\r\n     individual responsibility. Nothing adds such dignity to character\r\n     as the recognition of one's self-sovereignty; the right to an\r\n     equal place, everywhere conceded--a place earned by personal\r\n     merit, not an artificial attainment by inheritance, wealth,\r\n     family and position. Conceding then that the responsibilities of\r\n     life rest equally on man and woman, that their destiny is the\r\n     same, they need the same preparation for time and eternity. The\r\n     talk of sheltering woman from the fierce storms of life is the\r\n     sheerest mockery, for they beat on her from every point of the\r\n     compass, just as they do on man, and with more fatal results, for\r\n     he has been trained to protect himself, to resist, to conquer....\r\n\r\n     In music women speak again the language of Mendelssohn,\r\n     Beethoven, Chopin, Schumann, and are worthy interpreters of their\r\n     great thoughts. The poetry and novels of the century are theirs,\r\n     and they have touched the keynote of reform in religion, politics\r\n     and social life. They fill the editor's and professor's chair,\r\n     plead at the bar of justice, walk the wards of the hospital,\r\n     speak from the pulpit and the platform. Such is the type of\r\n     womanhood that an enlightened public sentiment welcomes to-day,\r\n     and such the triumph of the facts of life over the false theories\r\n     of the past.\r\n\r\n     Is it, then, consistent to hold the developed woman of this day\r\n     within the same narrow political limits as the dame with the\r\n     spinning wheel and knitting needle occupied in the past? No, no!\r\n     Machinery has taken the labors of woman as well as man on its\r\n     tireless shoulders; the loom and the spinning wheel are but\r\n     dreams of the past; the pen, the brush, the easel, the chisel,\r\n     have taken their places, while the hopes and ambitions of women\r\n     are essentially changed.\r\n\r\n     We see reason sufficient in the outer conditions of human beings\r\n     for individual liberty and development, but when we consider the\r\n     self-dependence of every human soul, we see the need of courage,\r\n     judgment and the exercise of every faculty of mind and body,\r\n     strengthened and developed by use, in woman as well as man....\r\n\r\nWith the earnest persuasiveness for which she had been noted nearly\r\nhalf a century, Lucy Stone (Mass.) said:\r\n\r\n     I come before this committee with the sense which I always feel,\r\n     that we are handicapped as women in what we try to do for\r\n     ourselves by the single fact that we have no vote. This cheapens\r\n     us. You do not care so much for us as if we had votes, so that we\r\n     come always with that infinite disadvantage.\r\n\r\n     But the thing I want to say particularly is that we have our\r\n     immortal Declaration of Independence and the various bills of\r\n     rights of the different States (George Washington advised us to\r\n     recur often to first principles), and in these nothing is clearer\r\n     than the basis of the claim that women should have equal rights\r\n     with men. A complete government is a perfectly just\r\n     government....\r\n\r\n     What I desire particularly to impress upon this committee is the\r\n     gross and grave injustice of holding thirty millions of women\r\n     absolutely helpless under the Government. The laws touch us at\r\n     every point. From the time the girl baby is born until the time\r\n     the aged woman makes her last will and testament, there is not\r\n     one of her affairs which the law does not control. It says who\r\n     shall own the property, and what rights the woman shall have; it\r\n     settles all her affairs, whether she shall buy or sell or will or\r\n     deed....\r\n\r\n     Persons are elected by men to represent them in Congress and the\r\n     State Legislatures, and here are these millions of women, with\r\n     just the same stake in the Government that men have, with a class\r\n     interest of their own, and with not one solitary word to say or\r\n     power to help settle any of the things which concern them.\r\n\r\n     Men know the value of votes and the possession of power, and I\r\n     look at them and wonder how it is possible for them to be willing\r\n     that their own mothers, sisters, wives and daughters should be\r\n     debarred from the possession of like power. We have been going to\r\n     the Legislature in Massachusetts longer than Mrs. Stanton has\r\n     been coming here. We asked that when a husband and wife make a\r\n     contract with each other, as for instance, if the wife loan the\r\n     husband her money, the contract should be considered valid just\r\n     as it would be between any other parties--for now in case the\r\n     husband fails in business, she can not get her money--and the\r\n     Legislature very kindly gave us leave to withdraw. Then we asked\r\n     that when a man dies and the wife is left alone, with the whole\r\n     burden of life on her shoulders, the law might give her more than\r\n     forty days in which to stay in her home without paying rent. But\r\n     we could not defeat one of our legislators, and they cared not a\r\n     cent for our petition and less than a cent for our opinion; and\r\n     so when we asked for this important measure they gave us leave to\r\n     withdraw.\r\n\r\n     They respect the wants of the voter, but they care nothing about\r\n     the wants of those who do not have votes. So, when we asked for\r\n     protection for wives beaten by their husbands, and that the\r\n     husband should be made to give a portion of his earnings to\r\n     support the minor children, again we had leave to withdraw....\r\n\r\n     I can think of nothing so helpless and humiliating as the\r\n     position of a disfranchised person. I do not know whether I am\r\n     treading on dangerous toes when I say that, after the late war\r\n     the Government in power wished to punish Jefferson Davis, and it\r\n     considered that the worst punishment it could inflict upon him\r\n     was to take away his right to vote. Now, the odium which attached\r\n     to him from his disfranchisement is just the same as attaches to\r\n     women from their disfranchisement. The only persons who are not\r\n     allowed to vote in Massachusetts are the lunatics, idiots, felons\r\n     and people who can not read and write. In what a category is this\r\n     to place women, after one hundred years and at the close of this\r\n     nineteenth century? And yet that is history. In Massachusetts we\r\n     are trying to get a small concession--the right to vote in the\r\n     cities and towns in which we live in regard to the taxes we have\r\n     to pay. In 1792, in Newburyport, Mass., it was not thought\r\n     necessary to give women education. At that time there were no\r\n     schools for girls; the public money was not so used, and when one\r\n     man said he had five daughters, and paid his taxes like other\r\n     men, and his girls were not allowed to attend school, and that\r\n     they ought to give the girls a chance, another man said, \"Take\r\n     the public money and educate shes? Never!\"\r\n\r\n     Remember this was one hundred years ago. Some of the fathers\r\n     urged that the girls should be educated in the public schools,\r\n     and so the men--God forgive them!--said, \"We will let the girls\r\n     go in the morning between 6 and 8 o'clock, before the boys want\r\n     the schoolhouse.\" Just think of the time those girls would have\r\n     to rise in order to have a little instruction before the boys got\r\n     there! This plan did not work well, and the teacher was directed\r\n     not to teach females any longer. Every descendant of those men\r\n     now feels ashamed of them; and I think that in one hundred years\r\n     the children of the men who are now letting us come here, year\r\n     after year, pleading for suffrage, will feel ashamed. Men would\r\n     rather lose anything than their votes; they would fight for their\r\n     right of suffrage, and if anybody attempted to deprive them of it\r\n     there would be war to the knife and the knife to the hilt. We\r\n     come here to carry on our bloodless warfare, praying that the\r\n     privilege granted in the foundation of the Government should be\r\n     applied to women....\r\n\r\n     What we look forward to is part of the eternal order. It is not\r\n     possible that thirty millions of women should be held forever as\r\n     lunatics, fools and criminals. It is not possible, as the years\r\n     go on, that each person should not at least have the right to\r\n     look after his or her own interests. As the home is at its best\r\n     when the father and mother consult together in regard to the\r\n     family interests, so it is with the Government. I do not think a\r\n     man can see from a man's point of view all the things that a\r\n     woman needs, or a woman from her single point of view all the\r\n     things that a man needs. Now men have brought their best, and\r\n     also brought their worst, into the Government, and it is all\r\n     here, but the thing you have not at all is the qualities which\r\n     women possess, the feminine qualities. It has been said that\r\n     women are more economical, peaceful and law-abiding than men, and\r\n     all these qualities are lacking in the Government today.... But\r\n     whether this be so or not, it is right that every class should be\r\n     heard in behalf of its own interest....\r\n\r\n     Now, gentlemen, I hope you will try to make this case your own.\r\n     It is simple justice and fair play, and it is also a fundamental\r\n     principle of the Government. Here we are trying to have a\r\n     complete republic, and yet there are twelve millions of\r\n     disfranchised adults. I believe that among the great people--and\r\n     by the people I do not mean men, but men and women, the whole\r\n     people--nothing creates such disrespect for a fundamental\r\n     principle as not to apply it. The Government was founded upon the\r\n     principle that those who obey the laws should make them, and yet\r\n     it shuts out a full half. As long as this continues to be done,\r\n     it certainly tends to create disrespect for the principle itself.\r\n     Do you not see it? Why not reach out a hand to woman and say,\r\n     \"Come and help us make the laws and secure fair play\"?\r\n\r\nAt the close of this argument Miss Anthony said: \"We have with us one\r\nnot so old in our cause as Mrs. Stone--I never call myself old because\r\nI shall be young until the crack of doom--and that is Mrs. Hooker, a\r\nsister of Harriet Beecher Stowe and Henry Ward Beecher. The world has\r\nalways made special place for the family of Beechers.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hooker (Conn.) spoke very briefly, saying: \"You all know those\r\nold Jewish words in the Decalogue, 'Honor thy father and thy mother\r\nthat thy days may be long in the land that the Lord thy God giveth\r\nthee.' If we want to help the republic, if we want to perpetuate the\r\ninstitutions our fathers brought across the water, we must honor the\r\nmothers equally with the fathers in the Government. To-day the laws\r\ncompel our sons the moment they are twenty-one to come to us and say:\r\n'My mother, I owe you much; sometimes I think all that is good in me\r\nhas come from you, but to-day you will retire and I will rule. I will\r\nno longer listen to your counsel; but I will make the laws for you and\r\nmy sisters, and you must obey them. Henceforth I am your ruler.' Now,\r\nfriends, a Government can not last long which teaches its sons\r\ndisrespect to its mothers. It is in line with our principles that we\r\nrecognize the mother element in the Government as well as in the\r\nfamily.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony closed the hearing with a strong appeal for a report from\r\nthe committee which should recommend Congress to submit a Sixteenth\r\nAmendment and allow the women of the country to carry their case to\r\nthe State Legislatures. The committee seemed much impressed by the\r\narguments, but evidently there was no change of opinion.[86]\r\n\r\nA hearing was granted February 17 by the House Judiciary Committee,\r\nwith delegates present from twenty-six States. Addresses were made in\r\npart as follows:\r\n\r\n     MRS. CHAPMAN CATT: ... You know that in these modern years there\r\n     has been a great deal of talk about natural rights, and we have\r\n     had an innumerable host of philosophers writing books to tell us\r\n     what natural rights are. I believe that to-day both scientists\r\n     and philosophers are agreed that they are the right to life, the\r\n     right to liberty, the right to free speech, the right to go where\r\n     you will and when you please, the right to earn your own living\r\n     and the right to do the best you can for yourself. One of the\r\n     greatest of those philosophers and writers, Herbert Spencer, has\r\n     accorded to woman the same natural rights as to man. I believe\r\n     every thoughtful man in the United States to-day concedes that\r\n     point.\r\n\r\n     The ballot has been for man a means of defending these natural\r\n     rights. Even now in some localities of the world those rights are\r\n     still defended by the revolver, as in former days, but in\r\n     peaceable communities the ballot is the weapon by means of which\r\n     they are protected. We find, as women citizens, that when we are\r\n     wronged, when our rights are infringed upon, inasmuch as we have\r\n     not this weapon with which to defend them, they are not\r\n     considered, and we are very many times imposed upon. We find that\r\n     the true liberty or the American people demands that all citizens\r\n     to whom these rights have been accorded should have that\r\n     weapon....\r\n\r\n     MRS. LIDA A. MERIWETHER (Tenn.): \"Oh, Cæsar, we who are about to\r\n     die salute you!\" was the gladiators' cry in the arena, standing\r\n     face to face with death and with the Roman populace. All over\r\n     this fair city, youth and beauty, freshness and joy, stand with\r\n     welcoming hands, calling you to all pleasures of ear and eye, of\r\n     soul and sense. But here, into the inner sanctuary of your\r\n     deepest, gravest thought, come, year after year, a little band of\r\n     women over whose heads the snows of many winters and of many\r\n     sorrows have sifted. Here \"we who are about to die salute you.\"\r\n     We do not come asking for gifts of profit or preferment for\r\n     ourselves; for us the day for ban or benison has almost passed.\r\n     But we ask for greater freedom, for better conditions for the\r\n     children of our love, whom we shall so soon leave behind. In the\r\n     short space allowed each petitioner we have not time to ask for\r\n     much. But in my State the grandmothers of seventy are growing\r\n     weary of being classed with the grandsons of seven. They fail to\r\n     find a valid reason why they should be relegated to perpetual\r\n     legal and political childhood.\r\n\r\n     Years ago, when the bugle call rang out over this unhappy land,\r\n     as the men rallied to the standard of their State, we, the wives\r\n     and mothers, who had no voice in bringing about those cruel\r\n     conditions, were called to give up our brightest and best for\r\n     cannons' food. We furnished the provisions, ministered on the\r\n     battlefield, nursed in the hospital; we, equally with our\r\n     brothers, regarded \"our lives, our fortunes and our sacred honor\"\r\n     only as gifts held in trust to spend and be spent for home and\r\n     State. And to-day when we see the wayfaring man, who probably\r\n     hails from a penal institution of the Old World, who honors no\r\n     home, no country and no political faith, freely enjoying the\r\n     right to say who shall make and who shall enforce the laws by\r\n     which we women are governed, we grow weary of being classed as\r\n     perpetual aliens upon our nation's soil.\r\n\r\n     The honest, industrious, bread-winning women of Tennessee do not\r\n     enjoy the knowledge that the pauper of their State is their\r\n     political superior. Four years ago we saw it practically\r\n     demonstrated that when a great moral issue was at stake the male\r\n     pauper could cast his ballot without hindrance from the penal\r\n     code, but if the widow or the single woman, who earned and owned\r\n     property and paid her quota of the tax for his support, should\r\n     attempt to cast a counteracting ballot, her penalty would be fine\r\n     or imprisonment.\r\n\r\n     Year after year we have journeyed to the Mecca of the\r\n     petitioner--the legislative halls. There we have asked protection\r\n     for our boys from the temptation of the open saloon; we have\r\n     asked that around our baby girls the wall of protection might be\r\n     raised at least a little higher than ten years; we have asked for\r\n     reform schools for boys, where they should not be thrown in daily\r\n     contact with old and hardened criminals. Year after year we have\r\n     pleaded for better conditions for the children to whom we have\r\n     given the might of our love, the strength and labor of our lives;\r\n     but in not one instance has that prayer been granted. And at last\r\n     we have found the reason why. A senator in a sister State said to\r\n     a body of petitioners: \"Ladies, you won't get your bill, but your\r\n     defeat will be a paying investment if it only teaches you that\r\n     the politician, little or big, is now, always was, and always\r\n     will be, the drawn image, pocket edition, safety valve and\r\n     speaking-trumpet of the fellow that voted him in.\"\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, we ask your help to the end that not we, perhaps, but\r\n     the daughters and granddaughters whom we leave behind, may be\r\n     counted with \"those that voted him in.\"\r\n\r\n     MRS. JEAN BROOKS GREENLEAF (N. Y.): Soon after I came to\r\n     Washington to make it my home for two years, one clear, bright\r\n     morning I drove up to this Capitol with a friend. As we ascended\r\n     the hill on the left we warmly expressed our admiration for the\r\n     beautiful structure within whose walls we are now standing, and\r\n     were enthusiastic in our admiration for those who so nobly\r\n     planned that, with the growth of the nation, there could be a\r\n     commensurate outstretching of its legislative halls without loss\r\n     to the dignity of the whole. We drove slowly around the front and\r\n     commenced the descent on the opposite side, when I called to the\r\n     driver to stop in order that we might feast our eyes on the\r\n     inspiring view which lay before us. There rose Washington\r\n     Monument so simple yet so grand, and I recalled the fact that in\r\n     its composition it fitly represented the Union of the States. My\r\n     heart swelled and my eyes overflowed as I thought of the grand\r\n     idea embodied in this Government, the possibilities of this\r\n     country's future. The lines of \"My country, 'tis of thee,\" rose\r\n     to my lips, but they died there.\r\n\r\n     Whence came my right to speak those words? True I was born here;\r\n     true I was taught from my earliest youth to repeat the glorious\r\n     words of Thomas Jefferson, Roger Sherman and other patriots; but\r\n     when I grew to womanhood I had to learn the bitter lesson that\r\n     these words applied only to men; that I simply counted as one in\r\n     the population; that I must submit to be governed by the laws in\r\n     the selection of whose makers I had no choice; that my consent to\r\n     be governed would never be asked; that for my taxation there\r\n     would be no representation; that, so far as my right to \"life,\r\n     liberty, and the pursuit of happiness\" was concerned, others must\r\n     judge for me; that I had no voice for myself; that I was a woman\r\n     without a country, and only on the plane of political equality\r\n     with the insane, the idiot, the pauper, Indians not taxed, the\r\n     criminal, and the unnaturalized foreigner.\r\n\r\n     Honorable gentlemen, women come here annually to ask that these\r\n     wrongs be righted. To-day we have come again to entreat that, as\r\n     you have extended this building to meet the needs of the people,\r\n     you will extend your thought of the people and make it possible\r\n     that the principle underlying the Government of this country may\r\n     be embodied in a law which will make the daughters of the land\r\n     joint heirs with the sons to all the rights and privileges of an\r\n     enfranchised people. In the name of the women of the State of New\r\n     York, I ask it.\r\n\r\n     MISS ALICE STONE BLACKWELL (Mass.): Except where there is some\r\n     very strong reason to the contrary, it is generally admitted that\r\n     every man has a right to be consulted in regard to his own\r\n     concerns. The laws which he has to obey and the taxes he has to\r\n     pay are things that do most intimately concern him, and the only\r\n     way of being directly consulted in regard to them, under our form\r\n     of government, is through the ballot. Is there any very good\r\n     reason why women should not be free to be consulted in this\r\n     direct manner? Let us consider a few of the reasons which are\r\n     generally given against this freedom of women, and see whether\r\n     they are good.\r\n\r\n     It is said that women do not need to vote, because they are\r\n     virtually represented by their husbands, fathers and brothers.\r\n     The first trouble with this doctrine of virtual representation is\r\n     that it is not according to numbers. I know a man who had a wife,\r\n     a widowed mother, four unmarried daughters and five unmarried\r\n     sisters. According to this theory his vote represented himself\r\n     and all those eleven women. Yet it counted but one, just the same\r\n     as the vote of his next-door bachelor neighbor without a female\r\n     relative in the world.\r\n\r\n     Then, again, suppose that all the women in one family do not\r\n     think alike. A member of our Massachusetts Legislature had two\r\n     daughters. One was a suffragist, the other was so much opposed\r\n     that she used to burn the _Woman's Journal_ as soon as it came in\r\n     the house. How was that man to represent both his daughters by\r\n     his single vote on the suffrage question? Instead of two\r\n     daughters he might have had three, one a Republican, one a\r\n     Democrat and the other a Prohibitionist. How could he have\r\n     represented all of them by his one vote unless he had voted\r\n     \"early and often?\"\r\n\r\n     Again, in order to represent the women of his family a man may\r\n     have to go without representation himself. There was a case of an\r\n     old gentleman in Chicago, a Greenbacker, who had three daughters,\r\n     all of whom were Republicans. When election day approached his\r\n     three daughters said to him that he was the natural\r\n     representative of their family--he had always told them so, and\r\n     they fully agreed with him--and they pointed out to him how very\r\n     wrong it would be, when that family consisted of three\r\n     Republicans and only one Greenbacker, with but one ballot to\r\n     represent the family, that it should be cast for the Greenback\r\n     candidate. The old gentleman was conscientious and consistent\r\n     and, although he was a man of strong Greenback convictions, he\r\n     actually voted the Republican ticket in order to represent his\r\n     daughters. It was the nearest he could come to representing them\r\n     under this theory. But did it give that family any accurate or\r\n     adequate representation? Evidently not. The Greenback candidate\r\n     was entitled to one vote from that family, and he did not get it;\r\n     and the Republican candidate was entitled to three ballots, and\r\n     he got only one. And then, in order to represent his daughters,\r\n     that chivalrous father had to go without any representation\r\n     himself. It is evident that the only fair way to get at public\r\n     sentiment in such a case is for each member of the family to have\r\n     one vote, and thus represent himself or herself.\r\n\r\n     Another proof that women are not virtually represented is to be\r\n     found in the laws as they actually exist. These one-sided laws\r\n     were not made because men meant to be unjust or unkind to women,\r\n     but simply because they naturally looked at things mainly from\r\n     their own point of view. It does not indicate any special\r\n     depravity on the part of men. I have no doubt that if women alone\r\n     had made the laws, those laws would be just as one-sided as they\r\n     are to-day, only in the opposite direction.\r\n\r\n     It is said that if women are enfranchised, husbands and wives\r\n     will vote just alike, and you will simply double the vote and\r\n     have no change in the result. Then, in the next breath, it is\r\n     said that husbands and wives would vote for opposing candidates,\r\n     and then there would be matrimonial quarrels. If they vote just\r\n     alike there will be no harm done, and this good may be done--the\r\n     women will be broadened by a knowledge of public affairs, and\r\n     husband and wife will have a subject of mutual interest in which\r\n     they can sympathize with each other. In cases where husband and\r\n     wife do not think alike as to who will make the best selectmen,\r\n     for instance, you will admit that is hardly sufficient to cause\r\n     them to quarrel; but if they should think differently on very\r\n     many other points, they would quarrel anyway, so that politics\r\n     would not make much difference with them.\r\n\r\n     Then it is said that women do not want to vote, and in proof it\r\n     is said they do not vote generally for school committeemen where\r\n     allowed to do so. We all know that the size of the vote cast at\r\n     any election is just in proportion to the amount of interest that\r\n     election calls forth. At a Presidential election nearly all the\r\n     voters turn out; in an ordinary State election only about half;\r\n     at a municipal election only a small fraction of the men take the\r\n     trouble to vote. The Troy _Press_ states that at a recent\r\n     election in Syracuse for a board of education, out of about 3,000\r\n     qualified voters only 40 voted.\r\n\r\n     Then, it is said that this movement is making no progress; that\r\n     while the movements along other lines are largely succeeding,\r\n     there has been no advance along this line. Twenty-five years ago,\r\n     with insignificant exceptions, women could not vote anywhere.\r\n     To-day they have school suffrage in twenty-three States, full\r\n     suffrage in Wyoming, municipal suffrage in Kansas, and municipal\r\n     suffrage for single women and widows in England, Scotland and\r\n     most of the British provinces. The common sense of the world is\r\n     slowly but surely working toward the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\n     MRS. ANNIE L. DIGGS (Kan.): You remember the time when the\r\n     theoretical objection was often urged that if the suffrage was\r\n     given to women, men would cease to show them the proper respect.\r\n     For instance, the weighty argument was made that they would not\r\n     raise their hats when they met women on the street, and that they\r\n     would not give up their seats in the cars. But, gentlemen, you\r\n     should just see how they take off their hats to us in Kansas, and\r\n     how every man of them gets up and offers us his seat when we come\r\n     into a street car!\r\n\r\n     It was also urged that if the ballot were put into the hands of\r\n     women it would be detrimental to the interests of the home. There\r\n     is not a man in the State to-day who would venture to go before a\r\n     Kansas audience and urge that objection. There is not a man there\r\n     who would be willing to jeopardize his political, social or\r\n     business interests by casting any kind of obloquy upon the women\r\n     who have exercised the right of the elective franchise for the\r\n     last five years. This is the result of success. We have Municipal\r\n     Suffrage. One little ounce of fact outweighs whole tons of\r\n     theory....\r\n\r\n     THE REV. ANNA HOWARD SHAW (Penn.): Yesterday I noticed in a\r\n     report of our hearing before the Judiciary Committee of the House\r\n     the headline, \"Appeals to Deaf Ears\". And I said, \"Has it come to\r\n     this, that when earnest and sincere women of this great country\r\n     make an appeal to the heads of the Government it is dubbed an\r\n     'Appeal to Deaf Ears'?\" Time was when the British Government\r\n     thought our ancestors had not sufficient merit in their cause to\r\n     be heard, and when they made an \"appeal to deaf ears\". But the\r\n     time came when those ears were unstopped and they heard, and what\r\n     they heard was the cry of victory by a free people. We may be\r\n     appealing to deaf ears to-day, but the time is coming when it\r\n     will not be so. Men will hear and, hearing, they will answer,\r\n     because ultimately men desire the right. If I were asked what I\r\n     conscientiously believe the real condition of the hearts of most\r\n     men to be, I should say they are positively ignorant in regard to\r\n     the justice of this matter, and if it could be brought properly\r\n     before them, they would stand on the side of justice and right\r\n     for women.\r\n\r\n     Therefore I desire only to say that I know from my travels all\r\n     over the country, conferring with the intelligent women to bring\r\n     before them this great principle, that the good work is going on.\r\n     It may be deafness yesterday and partial hearing to-day, but it\r\n     will be full hearing to-morrow. To-day we may be blind to the\r\n     truth; to-morrow we shall see the whole truth. We may not have\r\n     another centennial before we shall see justice for all human\r\n     kind.\r\n\r\n     You know, gentlemen, that this Government exists for only three\r\n     things, and in those every woman is as much interested as every\r\n     man. It exists for the administration of justice, for the\r\n     protection of person and property, and for the development of\r\n     society. Just as you and all men have persons and property to\r\n     protect, so we women have. We are because of our nature and\r\n     because it seems as if the Almighty had intended it should be so,\r\n     more interested than men in the development of society. Wherever\r\n     there is any movement for the uplifting of society you will find\r\n     women in the forefront. There never has been any great movement\r\n     in this nation when women have not stood side by side with the\r\n     noblest and truest men.\r\n\r\n     We do to-day nine-tenths of the philanthropic work, nine-tenths\r\n     of the church work, and form three-fourths of the church\r\n     membership. We are the teachers of the young; we are the mothers\r\n     of the race. If you want the noblest men you must have the\r\n     noblest mothers. \"Eye hath not seen, nor hath ear heard, nor hath\r\n     it entered into the heart of man to conceive\" the kind of men and\r\n     women God had in view when He created man in His own likeness and\r\n     gave to male and female dominion over the world, to subdue it and\r\n     to bring out of it the best things.\r\n\r\n     You who talk of a great Government in which the voice of God is\r\n     heard must remember that, if \"the voice of the people is the\r\n     voice of God,\" you never will know what that is until you get the\r\n     voice of the people, and you will find it has a soprano as well\r\n     as a bass. You must join the soprano voice of God to the bass\r\n     voice in order to get the harmony of the Divine voice. Then you\r\n     will have a law which will enable you to say, \"We are a people\r\n     justly ruled, because in this nation the voice of the people is\r\n     the voice of God, and the voice of the people has been heard.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Ellen M. Bolles (R. I.) said in the course of her remarks: \"The\r\nconditions surrounding women to-day are quite different from what they\r\nwere in the days of our grandmothers. Women are becoming property\r\nearners and owners, as they were not in those former times before they\r\nbegan asking for the ballot. Twenty-five per cent. or more of the\r\nwomen of this country are property owners. Nearly nine-tenths of the\r\nlaws are made for the protection of property and of those who own it\r\nand who earn wages. Now it seems to me that this twenty-five per cent.\r\nof the women should have a voice in the making of laws for the\r\nprotection of their property and of their right to earn a living....\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Colby thus closed her address on Wyoming: \"Having thus shown that\r\nthe twenty-two years' experience of woman suffrage has been\r\nsatisfactory to the citizens of Wyoming; that it has conduced to good\r\norder in the elections and to the purity of politics; that the\r\neducational system is improved and that teachers are paid without\r\nregard to sex; that Wyoming stands alone in a decreased proportion of\r\ncrime and divorce; and that it has elevated the personal character of\r\nboth sexes--what possible good is there left to speak of as coming to\r\nthat State from woman suffrage save its position as the vanguard of\r\nprogress and human freedom. Not the Bartholdi statue in New York\r\nharbor, but Wyoming on the crest of the continent, the first true\r\nrepublic, represents Liberty enlightening the world.\"\r\n\r\nShort addresses were made also by Mrs. Caroline McCullough Everhard,\r\nMrs. Mary Jewett Telford, the Rev. Mila F. Tupper, Mrs. Marble, Dr.\r\nFrances Dickinson, Miss H. Augusta Howard, Mrs. Saxon, Mrs. Hannah J.\r\nBailey, Mrs. Evaleen L. Mason and Mrs. Olive Pond Amies.[87]\r\n\r\nThe _Post_, in an account of the Senate hearing, said: \"Miss Anthony\r\ncalled attention to Senator Hoar as the gentleman who had presented\r\nthe first favorable suffrage report to the Senate in 1879. Everybody\r\nshouted \"Stand up,\" and as he retired deeper into his leather chair\r\nthey continued to cry, \"Up, up!\" It was a tableau when the Senator\r\nfound his feet, and at the same time was confronted with a round of\r\napplause and a volley of white handkerchiefs waved at him in\r\nChautauqua style. He capped the climax by moving at once a favorable\r\nreport. Laurel wreaths and bouquets would have been Senator Hoar's\r\nportion if they had been available, but the women all assured him\r\nafterward of their sincere appreciation. The hearing was held in the\r\nladies' reception room, which was completely filled.\"\r\n\r\nThese matchless arguments had no effect upon the Democratic members of\r\nthe committee, but Senator Warren of Wyoming made a favorable report\r\nfor himself, Senators Hoar of Massachusetts, Quay of Pennsylvania and\r\nAllen of Washington, which concluded by saying: \"The majority of the\r\nmembers of this committee, believing that equal suffrage, regardless\r\nof sex, should be the legitimate outgrowth of the principles of a\r\nrepublican form of government, and that the right of suffrage should\r\nbe conferred upon the women of the United States, earnestly recommend\r\nthe passage of the amendment submitted herewith.\"\r\n\r\nSenators Vance of North Carolina and George of Mississippi filed the\r\nsame minority report which already had done duty several times,\r\nalthough the former was said to have declared that the speeches of the\r\nwomen surpassed anything he ever had heard, and that their logic, if\r\nused in favor of any other measure, could not fail to carry it.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[85] David B.

Whatever may be the opinion of the world at\r\nlarge upon the feasibility or desirability of granting the franchise\r\nto women, none who attended their annual reunion of delegates or\r\nlistened to the addresses of their orators and leaders, can deny that\r\nthe convention was composed of clever, sensible and attractive women,\r\nsplendidly representative of their sex and of the present time.\"\r\n\r\nAfter complimentary notices of the leading members, it continued:\r\n\"'One very pleasant thing connected with our business committee is the\r\nbeautiful relations existing among its members,' said one of the\r\nofficers the other evening. 'We all have our opinions and they often\r\ndiffer, but we are absolutely true to each other and to the cause. We\r\nare most of us married, and all of us have the co-operation of our\r\nhusbands and fathers. Of the business committee of nine, six are\r\nmarried. For the past two years we have had one man on our board, the\r\nHon. Wm. Dudley Foulke, but as a rule men have not the time and\r\nthought to give this subject, as they are engaged in more remunerative\r\nemployment.' The self-control and good-nature prevailing even in the\r\nheated debate on the religious liberty interference resolution have\r\nalready been alluded to in our columns.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Susan B. Anthony presided over the convention, Jan. 16-19, 1893,\r\nheld in Metzerott's Music Hall and preceded by the usual religious\r\nservices Sunday afternoon. The sermon was given by the Rev. Annis F.\r\nEastman (N. Y.), an ordained Congregational minister, from the text in\r\nIsaiah, \"Take away the yoke.\"\r\n\r\nThe memorial service, which was of unusual impressiveness, opened with\r\nthe reading by Miss Anthony of Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton's tribute\r\nto the distinguished dead of the past year who advocated equality of\r\nrights for women--George William Curtis, John Greenleaf Whittier,\r\nErnestine L. Rose, Abby Hutchinson Patton and others.[88] Of Mr.\r\nCurtis she said:\r\n\r\n     If the success of our cause could be assured by the high\r\n     character of the men who from the beginning have identified\r\n     themselves with it, woman would have been emancipated long ago. A\r\n     reform advocated by Garrison, Phillips, Emerson, Alcott, Theodore\r\n     Parker, Gerrit Smith, Samuel J. May and George William Curtis\r\n     must be worthy the consideration of statesmen and bishops.\r\n\r\n     For more than one generation Mr. Curtis maintained a brave\r\n     attitude on this question. As editor of _Harper's Magazine_, and\r\n     as a popular lecturer on the lyceum platform, he was ever true to\r\n     his convictions. Before the war his lecture on Fair Play for\r\n     Women aroused much thought among the literary and fashionable\r\n     classes. In the New York Constitutional Convention in 1867, a\r\n     most conservative body, Mr. Curtis, though a young man and aware\r\n     that he had but little sympathy among his compeers, bravely\r\n     demanded that the word \"male\" should be stricken from the\r\n     suffrage article of the proposed constitution. His speech on that\r\n     occasion, in fact, philosophy, rhetoric and argument never has\r\n     been surpassed in the English language. From the beginning of his\r\n     public life to its close Mr. Curtis was steadfast on this\r\n     question. _Harper's Magazine_ for June, 1892, contains his last\r\n     plea for woman and for a higher standard for political\r\n     parties....\r\n\r\nMrs. Ernestine L. Rose, exiled from Poland on account of her religious\r\nfaith, married an Englishman and came to America, where she was one of\r\nthe first and most eloquent of the women who spoke on the public\r\nplatform. In 1836 she circulated petitions for the property rights of\r\nmarried women, in company with Mrs. Paulina Wright (Davis), and\r\npresented them to the New York Legislature. For forty years she was\r\namong the ablest advocates of the rights of women, lecturing also on\r\nreligion, government and other subjects. Mrs. Abby Hutchinson Patton\r\nwas lovingly referred to, the last but one of that family who had sung\r\nso many years for freedom, not only for the negro but for woman.\r\nWhittier, the uncompromising advocate of liberty for woman as well as\r\nfor man, was eulogized in fitting terms.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. A. G. Riddle (D. C.) offered a fine testimonial to Francis\r\nMinor and Gen. Benjamin F. Butler, saying: \"Mr. Minor was the first to\r\nurge the true and sublime construction of that noble amendment born of\r\nthe war. It declares that all persons--not simply males--born or\r\nnaturalized in the United States are citizens of the United States and\r\nof the State wherein they reside. Those who are denied or are refused\r\nthe right to exercise the privileges and franchises of citizenship are\r\nless than citizens. Those who still declare that women may not vote,\r\nsimply write 'falsehood' across that glorious declaration.\" General\r\nButler, as a leading member of the House Judiciary Committee, in a\r\nmatchless argument had asserted the right of women to vote under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment,[89] and used all his influence to secure\r\nsuffrage for women. Miss Anthony said in part:\r\n\r\n     The good of this hour is that it brings to the knowledge of the\r\n     young the work of the pioneers who have passed away. It seems\r\n     remarkable to those standing, as I do, one of a generation almost\r\n     ended, that so many of these young people know nothing of the\r\n     past; they are apt to think they have sprung up like somebody's\r\n     gourd, and that nothing ever was done until they came. So I am\r\n     always gratified to hear these reminiscences, that they may know\r\n     how others have sown what they are reaping to-day.\r\n\r\n     One of the earliest advocates of this cause was Sally Holly, the\r\n     daughter of Myron Holly, founder of the Liberty Party in the\r\n     State of New York, and also founder of Unitarianism in the city\r\n     of Rochester. Frederick Douglass will say a few words in regard\r\n     to Sally Holly, and of such of the others as he may feel moved to\r\n     speak; and I want to say that when, at the very first convention\r\n     called and managed by women, Elizabeth Cady Stanton read her\r\n     resolution that the elective franchise is the underlying right,\r\n     there was but one man to stand with her, and that man was\r\n     Frederick Douglass.\r\n\r\nMr. Douglass (D. C.) told of attempting to speak in Buffalo against\r\nslavery in 1843, when every hall was closed to him and he went into an\r\nabandoned storeroom:\r\n\r\n     I continued from day to day speaking in that old store to\r\n     laborers from the wharves, cartmen, draymen and longshoremen,\r\n     until after awhile the room was crowded. No woman made her\r\n     appearance at the meetings, but day after day for six days in\r\n     succession I spoke--morning, afternoon and evening. On the third\r\n     day there came into the room a lady leading a little girl. No\r\n     greater contrast could possibly have been presented than this\r\n     elegantly dressed, refined and lovely woman attempting to wend\r\n     her way through that throng. I don't know that she showed the\r\n     least shrinking from the crowd, but I noticed that they rather\r\n     shrank from her, as if fearful that the dust of their garments\r\n     would soil hers. Her presence to me at that moment was as if an\r\n     angel had been sent from Heaven to encourage me in my\r\n     anti-slavery endeavors. She came day after day thereafter, and at\r\n     last I had the temerity to ask her name. She gave it--Sally\r\n     Holly. \"A daughter of Myron Holly?\" said I. \"Yes,\" she answered.\r\n     I understood it all then, for he was amongst the foremost of the\r\n     men in western New York in the anti-slavery movement. His home\r\n     was in Rochester and his dust now lies in Mt. Hope, the beautiful\r\n     cemetery of that city. Over him is a monument, placed there by\r\n     that other true friend of women, Gerrit Smith of Peterboro....\r\n\r\n     I have seen the Hutchinson family in a mob in New York. When\r\n     neither Mr. Garrison, Mr. Phillips nor Mr. Burleigh, nor any one\r\n     could speak, when there was a perfect tempest and whirlwind of\r\n     rowdyism in the old Tabernacle on Broadway, then this family\r\n     would sing, and almost upon the instant that they would raise\r\n     their voices, so perfect was the music, so sweet the concord, so\r\n     enchanting the melody, that it came down upon the audience like a\r\n     summer shower on a dusty road, subduing, settling everything.\r\n\r\n     I can not add to the paper which Mrs. Stanton has sent. After\r\n     her--silence. Your cause has raised up no voice so potent as that\r\n     of Elizabeth Cady Stanton--no living voice except yours, Madame\r\n     President.\r\n\r\n     How delighted I am to see that you have the image of Lucretia\r\n     Mott here [referring to her marble bust on the stage]. I am glad\r\n     to be here, glad to be counted on your side, and glad to be able\r\n     to remember that those who have gone before were my friends. I\r\n     was more indebted to Whittier perhaps than to any other of the\r\n     anti-slavery people. He did more to fire my soul and enable me to\r\n     fire the souls of others than any other man. It was Whittier and\r\n     Pierpont who feathered our arrows, shot in the direction of the\r\n     slave power, and they did it well. No better reading can now be\r\n     had in favor of the rights of woman or the liberties of man than\r\n     is to be found in their utterances....\r\n\r\nMiss Clara Barton (D. C.) spoke in a touching manner of the great\r\nservice rendered to humanity by Dr. Harriet N. Austin, who assisted\r\nDr. James C. Jackson to establish the \"Home on the Hillside,\" the\r\nDansville (N. Y.) Sanitorium. Henry B. Blackwell told of John L.\r\nWhiting, \"a power and a strength to the Massachusetts Suffrage\r\nAssociation for many years, one of those rare men not made smaller by\r\nwealth, and always willing to give himself, his mind, his heart, his\r\nmoney, to help the cause of woman.\" The Rev. Anna Howard Shaw said in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n     I have been asked to speak a word of Mrs. Ralph Waldo Emerson. It\r\n     has been said by some people that we have wrongfully quoted Mr.\r\n     Emerson as being on our side. His biographers appear to have put\r\n     in his early statements and forgotten to include his later\r\n     declarations, which were all in favor of the enfranchisement of\r\n     women.\r\n\r\n     I was once sent to Concord by the Massachusetts society to hold a\r\n     meeting. The churches were closed against suffrage speakers and\r\n     there was not money enough to pay for a hall. Mrs. Ralph Waldo\r\n     Emerson heard the meeting was to be given up, and she sent a\r\n     message to the lady having the work in charge, saying: \"Shall it\r\n     be said that here in Concord, where the Revolutionary war began,\r\n     there is no place to speak for the freedom of women? Get the best\r\n     hall in town and I will pay for it.\" So on that occasion and on\r\n     another Mrs. Emerson paid for the hall and sent a kind word to\r\n     the meeting, declaring herself in favor of the suffrage for\r\n     women, and stating that her husband's views and her own were\r\n     identical on this question. She had the New England trait of\r\n     being a good wife, a good mother and a good housekeeper, and Mr.\r\n     Emerson's home was a restful and blessed place. We sometimes\r\n     forget the wives of great men in thinking of the greatness of\r\n     their husbands, but Mrs. Emerson was as great in her way as Mr.\r\n     Emerson in his, and no more faithful friend to woman and to\r\n     woman's advancement ever has lived among us.[90]\r\n\r\n     A word as to the Rev. Anna Oliver, the first woman to enter the\r\n     theological department of Boston University. She was much beloved\r\n     by her class. She was a devoted Christian, eminently orthodox,\r\n     and a very good worker in all lines of religious effort. After\r\n     Miss Oliver graduated she was ambitious to become ordained, as\r\n     all women ought to be who desire to preach the gospel; and so\r\n     after I had graduated from the theological school, the year\r\n     following, we both applied to the conference of the Methodist\r\n     Episcopal Church for admission. Miss Oliver's name beginning with\r\n     O and mine with S, her case was presented first. She was denied\r\n     ordination by Bishop Andrews. Our claims were carried to the\r\n     general conference in Cincinnati, and the Methodist Episcopal\r\n     Church denied ordination to the women whom it had graduated in\r\n     its schools and upon whom it had conferred the degree of bachelor\r\n     of divinity. It not only did this, but it made a step backwards;\r\n     it took from us the licenses to preach which had been granted to\r\n     Miss Oliver for four years and to myself for eight years.\r\n\r\n     But Miss Oliver was earnest in her efforts, and so she began to\r\n     preach in the city of Brooklyn, and with great courage bought a\r\n     church in which a man had failed as a minister, leaving a debt of\r\n     $14,000. She was like a great many other women--and here is a\r\n     warning for all women. God made a woman equal to a man, but He\r\n     did not make a woman equal to a woman _and_ a man. We usually try\r\n     to do the work of a man and of a woman too; then we break down,\r\n     and they say that women ought not to be ministers because they\r\n     are not strong enough. They do not get churches that can afford\r\n     to send them to Europe on a three months' vacation once a year.\r\n     Miss Oliver was not only the minister and the minister's wife,\r\n     but she started at least a dozen reforms and undertook to carry\r\n     them all out. She was attacked by that influential Methodist\r\n     paper, the _Christian Advocate_, edited by the Rev. Dr. James M.\r\n     Buckley, who declared that he would destroy her influence in the\r\n     church, and so with that great organ behind him he attacked her.\r\n     She had that to fight, the world to fight and the devil to fight,\r\n     and she broke down in health. She went abroad to recover, but\r\n     came home only to die.[91]\r\n\r\nThe death of those less widely known was touchingly referred to by\r\nwomen of the different States. Miss Anthony closed the services by\r\nsaying: \"I am just informed that we must add to this list the revered\r\nname of Abby Hopper Gibbons, of four-score-and-ten, who with her\r\nfather, Isaac T. Hopper, formed the Women's Prison Association, and\r\nwho has stood for more than the allotted years of man the sentinel on\r\nthe watch-tower to guard unfortunate women and help them back into\r\nwomanly living.\"\r\n\r\nAt the first evening session Miss Anthony, in her president's address,\r\nanswered the question, \"What has been gained by the forty years'\r\nwork?\" She called attention to the woman who had preached the day\r\nbefore, ordained by an orthodox denomination; to the women alternate\r\ndelegates to the late National Republican Convention; to the\r\nrecommendation of Gov. Roswell P. Flower that women should be\r\ndelegates to the approaching New York Constitutional Convention. She\r\npointed out rapidly many other straws showing the direction of the\r\nwind, saying: \"Wendell Phillips said what he wanted to do on the\r\nabolition question was to turn Congress into an anti-slavery debating\r\nsociety. That is what we have done with every educational, industrial,\r\nreligious and political body--we have turned them all into debating\r\nsocieties on the woman question.\"\r\n\r\nU. S. Senator Joseph M. Carey (Wy.) sent a letter reaffirming his\r\nconviction that the granting of full political rights to women would\r\nbe for the best interests of the country. Mr. Blackwell sketched the\r\nsuccessive extensions of suffrage to women, and set forth the special\r\nimportance of their trying to secure the Municipal and the\r\nPresidential franchises, both of which could be granted by the\r\nLegislature. Mrs. Ellen Battelle Dietrick (Mass.) read an able paper\r\non The Best Methods of Interesting Women in Suffrage, in which she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     The truth is, the American woman has been so pleasantly soothed\r\n     by the sweet opiate of that high-sounding theory of her\r\n     \"sovereignty,\" that until very recently she could not be aroused\r\n     to examine the facts. Forty years ago the voices of a few crying\r\n     in the wilderness began to prepare the way for the present\r\n     awakening....\r\n\r\n     The deliverance of woman must have as its corner-stone\r\n     self-support. The first step in this direction must be to explode\r\n     the fallacy that marriage is a state of being supported. As men\r\n     are most largely the gatherers of money, it is mistakenly assumed\r\n     that they are most largely the creators of wealth. The man goes\r\n     abroad and gives his daily labor toward earning his board and\r\n     clothes; but what he actually receives for his work can neither\r\n     be eaten nor worn. It does nothing whatever until he puts it into\r\n     his wife's hands, and upon her intelligence, energy and ability\r\n     depend how much can be done through the using of it. Not until\r\n     her labor in transforming raw material, in cooking, sewing, and\r\n     rendering a house habitable, is joined to his, can a man be said\r\n     to have really received anything worth having. He begins, she\r\n     completes, the making of their joint wealth. Their dependence is\r\n     mutual; the position of the one who turns the money into usable\r\n     material by her labor being equally important, equally valuable,\r\n     with that of him who turned his labor into money; and this must\r\n     be fully recognized if woman is ever to come into her true\r\n     relation to man. She supports him exactly as he supports her, and\r\n     this is equally the case with the wife who herself produces\r\n     directly, or the one who gives her time and intelligence to\r\n     direct the production of others....\r\n\r\n     Closely allied to the fallacy that man supports woman is the\r\n     fallacy that man protects woman, and has a right to control her\r\n     by virtue of this protection. There was a period in the world's\r\n     transition from savagery to civilization when mankind had so\r\n     little conception of the mutuality of human interests that war\r\n     was a perpetual condition of society. Originally women also were\r\n     fighters; just as the lioness or tigress is as capable as her\r\n     mate of self-defense and protection of her young, so the savage\r\n     woman, when necessity required, was equally capable of conducting\r\n     warfare in the same cause. But long before men had given up\r\n     killing each other for the better business of trading with and\r\n     helping each other woman had ceased to be a fighter. She was the\r\n     first to see the advantages of peace, both because she was the\r\n     earliest manufacturer and trader and because it cost her more in\r\n     the production of every soldier than it cost man. Instinct\r\n     directed her toward peace long before reason made it possible for\r\n     her to explain why she hated war, and she hated it as an\r\n     occupation for herself long before it occurred to her to despise\r\n     it as an occupation for man. To-day the love of peace and hatred\r\n     for war which she is rapidly spreading through the world is the\r\n     real protector of woman; she is a self-protector by virtue of\r\n     this proclivity, and, as war is equally the enemy of man, here\r\n     again woman gives to man as much as she receives. Whatever force\r\n     the argument based on the right of soldiers to rule may once have\r\n     had is rapidly passing away. The era of the destroyer is dying,\r\n     the epoch of the Creator is coming in....\r\n\r\n     The subjugation of woman doubtless arose from an honest desire of\r\n     man to protect her. His mistake lay in assuming that his mind and\r\n     will could do private and public duty for both. Woman's mistake\r\n     lay in assuming that she might with safety permit man's mind and\r\n     will to discharge the duties nature meant to be fulfilled by her\r\n     own. Unhappily nature has a way of allowing the human race to\r\n     learn by its own experience, even though the lesson consume ages\r\n     of time; and she has also a rule that unused faculties and\r\n     functions fall into a state of atrophy. It was by such a\r\n     substitution of masculine for feminine will that woman fell so\r\n     far behind him whom she originally led in the race, industrial\r\n     and intellectual. If they are ever to march side by side as true\r\n     comrades and free partners, it must be by a voluntary resumption\r\n     of independence in feminine mind and will. In this man can assist\r\n     by stimulating her spirit of independence, or he can discourage\r\n     it by a contrary course, but the final result lies with woman\r\n     herself. She alone can free herself from the habits of thought\r\n     and action engendered by thousands of years of slavery.\r\n\r\n     The steps toward the emancipation of women are first\r\n     intellectual, then industrial, lastly legal and political. Great\r\n     strides in the first two of these stages already have been made\r\n     by millions of women who do not yet perceive that it is surely\r\n     carrying them towards the last.\r\n\r\nIn the address of Mrs. Ruth C. D. Havens (D. C.) on The Girl of the\r\nFuture, which was greatly enjoyed, she said:\r\n\r\n     The training and education of the girl of the present have seldom\r\n     been discussed except from one standpoint--her suitable\r\n     preparation for becoming an economical housekeeper, an\r\n     inexpensive wife, a willing and self-forgetful mother, a cheap,\r\n     unexacting, patient, unquestioning, unexpectant, ministering\r\n     machine. The girl's usefulness to herself, to her sex and race,\r\n     her preferences, tastes, happiness, social, intellectual or\r\n     financial prosperity, hardly have entered into the thought upon\r\n     this question....\r\n\r\n     If woman would be a student, a scientist, a lecturer, a\r\n     physician; if she would be a pioneer in a wilderness of scoffers\r\n     to make fair roads up which her sex might easily travel to equal\r\n     educational and legal rights, equal privileges and pay in fields\r\n     of labor, equal suffrage--she must divide her eager energies and\r\n     give the larger half to superior homekeeping, wifehood and\r\n     motherhood, in order that her new gospel shall be received with\r\n     any respect or acceptance. And probably no class of women have\r\n     been such sticklers for the cultivation of all woman's modest,\r\n     unassuming home duties as have been the great, ambitious teachers\r\n     on this suffrage platform....\r\n\r\n     But this will not be the training of the girl of the future. It\r\n     is not the sort of preparation to which the boy of the present is\r\n     urged. \"Jack of all trades, good at none\" is the old epithet\r\n     bestowed upon a man who thus diffuses his energies. You do not\r\n     expect a distinguished lawyer to clean his own clothes, a doctor\r\n     to groom his horse, a teacher to take care of the schoolhouse\r\n     furnace, a preacher to half-sole his shoes. This would be\r\n     illogical, and men are nothing if not logical. Yet a woman who\r\n     enters upon any line of achievement is invariably hampered, for\r\n     at least the early years, with the inbred desire to add to the\r\n     labor of her profession all the so-called feminine duties, which,\r\n     fulfilled to-day, are yet to be done to-morrow, which bring to\r\n     her neither comfort, gain nor reputation, and which by their\r\n     perpetual demand diminish her powers for a higher quality of\r\n     work....\r\n\r\n     Everywhere there is too much housekeeping. It is not economy of\r\n     time or money for every little family of moderate means to\r\n     undertake alone the expensive and wearing routine. The married\r\n     woman of the future will be set free by co-operative methods,\r\n     half the families on a square, perhaps, enjoying one luxurious,\r\n     well-appointed dining-room with expenses divided _pro rata_. In\r\n     many other ways housekeeping will be simplified. Homes have no\r\n     longer room for people--they are consecrated to things. Parlors\r\n     and bedrooms are full of the cheap and incongruous or expensive\r\n     and harmonious belongings of a junk shop. Plush gods hold the\r\n     fort. All the average house needs to make it a museum is the\r\n     sign, \"Hands off.\" ...\r\n\r\n     The girl of the future will select her own avocation and take her\r\n     own training for it. If she be a houseworker, and many will\r\n     prefer to be, she will be so valuable in that line as to command\r\n     much respect and good wages. If she be an architect, a jeweler,\r\n     an electrical engineer, she will not rob a cook by mutilating a\r\n     dinner, or a dressmaker by amateur cutting and sewing, or a\r\n     milliner by creating her own bonnet. The house helper will not be\r\n     incompetent, because the development and training of woman for\r\n     her best and truest work will have extended to her also, and she\r\n     will do housework because she loves it and is better adapted to\r\n     it than to any other employment. She will preside in the kitchen\r\n     with skill and science.\r\n\r\n     The service girl of the future will be paid perhaps double or\r\n     treble her present wages, with wholesome food, a cheerful room,\r\n     an opportunity to see an occasional cousin and some leisure for\r\n     recreation. At present this would be ruinous, and why? Because\r\n     too frequently the family has but one producer. The wife, herself\r\n     a consumer, produces more consumers. Daughters grow up around a\r\n     man like lilies of the field, which toil not, neither do they\r\n     spin. Every member of every family in the future will be a\r\n     producer of some kind and in some degree. The only one who will\r\n     have the right of exemption will be the mother, for a child can\r\n     hardly be born with cheerful views of living whose mother's life\r\n     has been, for its sake, a double burden. From this root spring\r\n     melancholy, insanity, suicide. The production of human souls is\r\n     the highest production of all, the one which requires most\r\n     preparation, truest worth, gravest care and holiest consecration.\r\n     If the girl of the future recognizes this truth, she will have\r\n     made an advance indeed. But apart from the mother every member of\r\n     the family should be a material producer; and then there will be\r\n     means sufficient for the producer in the kitchen to get such\r\n     remuneration for her skill as will eliminate the incompetent,\r\n     shirking, migratory creature of today....\r\n\r\n     I hardly need say to this audience that the girl of the future\r\n     will vote. She will not plead for the privilege--she will be\r\n     urged to exercise the right, and no one will admit that he ever\r\n     opposed it, or remember that there was a time when woman's ballot\r\n     was despised and rejected of men. She will not be told that she\r\n     needs the suffrage for her own protection, but she will be urged\r\n     to exercise it for the good of her country and of humanity. It\r\n     will not be known that the Declaration of Independence was once a\r\n     dead letter. No one will believe that it ever was declared that\r\n     the Constitution did not protect this right. It will be\r\n     incredible that women were once neither people nor citizens, _and\r\n     yet were the mothers, and in so much the creators, of the men who\r\n     governed them_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary S. Lockwood (D. C.), member-at-large of the World's Fair\r\nBoard of Lady Managers, read a carefully prepared statement of the\r\nmethods and aims of that body, which began: \"The Board of Lady\r\nManagers owe their existence to Susan B. Anthony and her co-workers.\r\nIt was these women who went before Congress and not only asked but\r\ndemanded that women should have a place in the management of this\r\nColumbian Exposition--and they got it\"![92] She closed as follows:\r\n\r\n     I have been greatly impressed as I have come into this hall from\r\n     day to day, and have looked upon the sweet representative face in\r\n     marble of Lucretia Mott and the benign, glorified face of Mrs.\r\n     Stanton, with Susan B. Anthony as the central figure of the trio,\r\n     and have thought of the years they have lifted up their voices\r\n     praying they might see the glory of the coming of the Lord; and I\r\n     have felt if only I could bring before them the sheaves which we\r\n     are gathering from the women of the earth for this great\r\n     exposition; if only I could show them how their work has put the\r\n     women of this nation in touch with the women of every other\r\n     country, awakening them to new aspirations, new hopes, new\r\n     efforts, to whom the dawn of a brighter day is visible--these\r\n     pioneers would say, \"Our eyes are indeed opened; a handful of\r\n     corn planted on the top of the mountain has been made to shake\r\n     all Lebanon.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Mary H. Williams (Neb.) reported that, as chairman of a committee\r\nfor this purpose, she had sent letters to forty-nine Governors of\r\nStates and Territories; twenty-one replies had been received--nine in\r\nfavor of full suffrage for women, two of school suffrage only, three\r\nwere totally opposed and the others made evasive replies. The nine in\r\nfavor were Governors Barber of Wyoming, Routt of Colorado, Mellette of\r\nSouth Dakota, Winans of Michigan, Thomas of Utah, Burke of North\r\nDakota, Humphrey of Kansas, Colcord of Nevada, Knapp of Alaska. All of\r\nthese were Western men and all Republicans but Winans. Tillman of\r\nSouth Carolina and Willey of Idaho favored school suffrage alone.\r\nStone of Mississippi and Fleming of West Virginia answered \"no\". Gov.\r\nJames E. Boyd of Nebraska was opposed, although he would allow women\r\nto vote on school questions. Governor Boyd's election had been\r\ncontested on the ground that his father had not been properly\r\nnaturalized.\r\n\r\nGov. Thomas M. Holt of North Carolina replied: \"I am utterly opposed\r\nto woman suffrage in any shape or form. I have a wife and three\r\ndaughters, all married, who are as much opposed to women going into\r\npolitics as I am, and they _reflex_ the sentiment of our Southern\r\nwomen generally.\"\r\n\r\nGov. Francis P. Fleming of Florida gave nine reasons why he was\r\nopposed, but concluded: \"The above objections would not as a rule\r\napply to church or school elections, and as women are usually much\r\nmore pious than men and take more interest in church matters, I am\r\ninclined to think it would be well for them to vote at church\r\nelections, and am not aware of any particular objection to their\r\nvoting at school elections.\"\r\n\r\nThe address of Mrs. Orra Langhorne (Va.) was read by her niece, Miss\r\nHenderson Dangerfield. It gave a charming picture of the oldtime\r\nSouthern woman, her responsible social position, her care for her\r\ngreat household in her own small world; described how she was\r\nhandicapped by tradition and lack of intellectual training; depicted\r\nthe changed conditions since the war and her gradual awakening to the\r\ndemands of modern life and the need of larger rights.\r\n\r\nLucy Stone was not able to be present and a letter from her was read\r\nby her husband, Mr. Blackwell:\r\n\r\n     DEAR FRIENDS:--Wherever woman suffragists are gathered together\r\n     in the name of equal rights, there am I always in spirit with\r\n     them. Although unable to be present in person, my glad greeting\r\n     goes to you, every one, to those who have borne the heat and\r\n     burden of the day, and to the strong, brave, younger workers who\r\n     have come to lighten the load and help bring the victory. The\r\n     work still calls for patient perseverance and ceaseless endeavor;\r\n     but we have every reason to rejoice when there are so many gains\r\n     and when favorable conditions abound on every hand. The end is\r\n     not yet in sight, but it can not be far away. The road before us\r\n     is shorter than the road behind.\r\n\r\nThis was her last message to the association. She passed away in\r\nOctober of this year, having labored nearly half a century for the\r\nenfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, in an address entitled Comparisons Are\r\nOdious, showed the contrast between the Government's treatment of the\r\nSioux Indians, exempted from taxation and allowed to vote, and of\r\nlaw-abiding, intelligent women in the same section of the country,\r\ncompelled to pay taxes and not allowed to vote.[93] Miss Elizabeth\r\nUpham Yates closed the evening with a brilliant address.\r\n\r\nBefore adjourning Miss Anthony read Gov. Roswell P. Flower's\r\ncertificate appointing her a member of the Board of Managers of the\r\nState Industrial School at Rochester, N. Y. She took considerable\r\nsatisfaction in pointing out that it referred to her as \"him,\" because\r\nshe had always contended that, if the masculine pronoun in an official\r\ndocument is sufficient to send a woman to the jail or the gallows, it\r\nis sufficient to enable her to vote and hold office.\r\n\r\nOn the last evening, the Hon. Carroll D. Wright, U. S. Commissioner of\r\nLabor, delivered a valuable address on The Industrial Emancipation of\r\nWomen, in which he said:\r\n\r\n     Until within a comparatively recent period, woman's subjection to\r\n     man has been well-nigh complete in all respects, whether such\r\n     subjection is considered from a social, political, intellectual\r\n     or even a physical point of view. At first the property of man,\r\n     she emerged under civilization from the sphere of a drudge to\r\n     that of a social factor and, consequently, into the liberty of\r\n     cultivating her mental faculties....\r\n\r\n     Industrial emancipation, using the term broadly, means the\r\n     highest type of woman as the result, the word \"industrial\"\r\n     comprehending in this sense all remunerative employment. The\r\n     entrance of woman into the industrial field was assured when the\r\n     factory system of labor displaced the domestic or hand labor\r\n     system. The age of invention, with the wonderful ramifications\r\n     which invention always has produced, must be held accountable for\r\n     bringing woman into a field entirely unknown to her prior to that\r\n     age. As an economic factor, either in art, literature or\r\n     industry, she was before that time hardly recognizable. With the\r\n     establishment of the factory system, the desire of woman to have\r\n     something more than she could earn as a domestic or in\r\n     agricultural labor, or to earn something where before she had\r\n     earned nothing, resulted in her becoming an economic factor, and\r\n     she was obliged to submit to all the conditions of this new\r\n     position. It hardly can be said that in the lower forms of\r\n     industrial pursuits she superseded man, but it is true that she\r\n     supplemented his labors....\r\n\r\n     Each step in industrial progress has raised her in the scale of\r\n     civilization rather than degraded her. As a result she has\r\n     constantly gone up higher and gained intellectual advantages,\r\n     such as the opening to her of the higher institutions of\r\n     learning, which have in turn equipped her for the best\r\n     professional employment. The moral plane of the so-called\r\n     workingwoman certainly is higher than that of the woman engaged\r\n     in domestic service, and is equal to that of any class of women\r\n     in the community....\r\n\r\n     As women have occupied the positions of bookkeepers, telegraphers\r\n     and many of what might be called semi-professional callings, men\r\n     have entered engineering, electrical, mechanical and other\r\n     spheres of work which were not known when women first stepped\r\n     into the industrial field. As the latter have progressed from\r\n     entire want of employment to that which pays a few dollars per\r\n     week, men, too, have progressed in their employments, and\r\n     occupied larger fields not existing before....\r\n\r\n     Woman is now stepping out of industrial subjection and coming\r\n     into the industrial system of the present as an entirely new\r\n     economic factor. If there were no other reasons, this alone would\r\n     be sufficient to make her wages low and prevent their very rapid\r\n     increase.... The growing importance of woman's labor, her general\r\n     equipment through technical education, her more positive\r\n     dedication to the life-work she chooses, the growing sentiment\r\n     that an educated and skilful woman is a better and truer\r\n     companion in marriage than an ignorant and unskilful one, her\r\n     appreciation of the value of organization, the general uplifting\r\n     of the principle of integrity in business circles, woman's\r\n     gradual approach to man's powers in mental achievement also, her\r\n     possible and probable political influence--all these combined,\r\n     working along general avenues of progress and evolution, will\r\n     bring her industrial emancipation, by which she will stand on an\r\n     equality with man in those callings in life for which she may be\r\n     fitted. As she approaches this equality her remuneration will be\r\n     increased and her economic importance acknowledged....\r\n\r\n     If woman's industrial emancipation leads to what many are pleased\r\n     to call \"political rights,\" we must not quarrel with it. It is\r\n     not just that all other advantages which may come through this\r\n     emancipation shall be withheld simply because one great privilege\r\n     on which there is a division of sentiment may also come.\r\n\r\n     One of the greatest boons which will result from the industrial\r\n     emancipation of woman will be the frank admission on the part of\r\n     the true and chivalric man that she is the sole and rightful\r\n     owner of her own being in every respect, and that whatever\r\n     companionship may exist between her and man shall be as\r\n     thoroughly honorable to her as to him.\r\n\r\nMiss Harriet May Mills (N. Y.) gave a paper on The Present Political\r\nStatus of Woman, which showed the trained mind and logical method of\r\nthought one would expect from a graduate of Cornell University. The\r\nlast address of the convention was given by the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nentitled The America Undiscovered by Columbus. This, like so many of\r\nMiss Shaw's unsurpassed lectures, will be lost to posterity because\r\nunwritten and not stenographically reported.\r\n\r\nIn her report as vice-president-at-large Miss Shaw announced that she\r\nhad given during the year 215 lectures for which she had received pay,\r\ntwenty-five of these for suffrage associations and the rest for\r\ntemperance and literary organizations, but on every occasion it had\r\nbeen a suffrage lecture. In addition she had given gratuitously to the\r\nservice of this cause lectures which at her regular price would have\r\namounted to $1,265. She also related the following incident: \"I was\r\npresent at the National Woman's Christian Temperance Union in Denver,\r\nand Miss Willard introduced me as a fraternal delegate from the\r\nNational Suffrage Association. I made my little speech and the whole\r\nconvention arose and waved their handkerchiefs at the message sent by\r\nthis body. One woman jumped to her feet and moved that a telegram be\r\nreturned from that convention, giving its sisterly sympathy. Miss\r\nWillard got up and said, 'Shoo, ladies; this is different from what it\r\nwas in Washington in 1881, when you refused to let me have Miss\r\nAnthony on my platform. Things are coming around, girls.'\"\r\n\r\nThe corresponding secretary, Mrs. Rachel Foster Avery, announced that\r\nthirty-three State associations were auxiliary to the national. Miss\r\nAdelaide Johnson was introduced as the sculptor who had modeled the\r\nfine busts of Lucretia Mott, Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony, which were\r\non the platform. Miss Laura Clay reported on the work that had just\r\nbeen commenced in the Southern States, which she considered a most\r\nhopeful field. In the discussion on Press Work, when it was proposed\r\nthat the association start an official paper, Miss Anthony said with\r\nmuch feeling: \"I had an experience in publishing a paper about\r\ntwenty-five years ago and I came to grief. I never hear of a woman\r\nstarting a suffrage paper that my blood does not tingle with agony for\r\nwhat that poor soul will have to endure--the same agony I went\r\nthrough. I feel, however, that we shall never become an immense power\r\nin the world until we concentrate all our money and editorial forces\r\nupon one great national daily newspaper, so we can sauce back our\r\nopponents every day in the year; once a month or once a week is not\r\nenough.\r\n\r\nThe resolutions presented by the chairman, Mrs. Dietrick, were adopted\r\nwithout dissent,[94] except the last:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The Constitution of the United States promises\r\n     noninterference with the religious liberty of the people; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Congress is now threatening to abridge the liberties of\r\n     all in response to ecclesiastical dictation from a portion of the\r\n     people; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That this association enters a protest against any\r\n     national attempt to control the innocent inclinations of the\r\n     people either on the Jewish Sabbath or the Christian Sunday, and\r\n     this we do quite irrespective of our individual opinions as to\r\n     the sanctity of Sunday.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we especially protest against this present\r\n     attempt to force all the people to follow the religious dictates\r\n     of a part of the people, as establishing a precedent for the\r\n     entrance of a most dangerous complicity between Church and State,\r\n     thereby subtly undermining the foundation of liberty, so\r\n     carefully laid by the wisdom of our fathers.\r\n\r\nThis precipitated the discussion as to the opening of the World's Fair\r\non Sunday which had been vigorously waged during two preceding\r\nconventions without resulting in definite action. It was now continued\r\nduring three sessions and then, by majority vote, indefinitely\r\npostponed. Mrs. Avery, chairman of the Columbian Exposition\r\nCommittee,[95] closed her report as follows: \"As we are to be\r\nrepresented in so many ways during the World's Fair--i. e., at the\r\nWorld's Congress of Representative Women, in the Suffrage Congresses,\r\nin the meetings to be held in the auditorium of the Woman's Building,\r\nin the program to be presented by us for the approval of the Committee\r\non General Meetings of the Board of Lady Managers--I would strongly\r\nurge against attempting to hold a separate Suffrage Congress, either\r\nnational or international, during the Exposition.\" This was agreed to.\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Committee, through Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton,\r\nreported that 375 letters had been sent to members of Congress asking\r\nfor an expression on the question of woman suffrage. Of those who\r\nresponded fifty-nine were in favor of full suffrage; twenty-five of\r\nqualified suffrage; sixty-five wholly opposed. The remainder did not\r\nreply, although stamps were enclosed. This committee also arranged for\r\nthe printing, purchasing and distributing of 23,000 copies of the\r\nSenate and House hearings. The report concluded: \"The time has come\r\nwhen women wanting legislation must proceed exactly as men do who want\r\nit. No man procures an office for himself or a friend, nor does any\r\nman or association get an Act passed, unless the claim is persistently\r\npressed, not only upon the members of the committee in charge of it\r\nbut upon his friends and acquaintances in Congress. There is no use in\r\nsupposing the justice or right of a question, without persistent work,\r\nis going to bring about a reform.\"[96]\r\n\r\nMrs. Colby, chairman of the Committee on Federal Suffrage, appointed\r\nto urge the legal right of women to vote for Representatives under the\r\nU. S. Constitution, reported that she had sent a copy of Francis\r\nMinor's argument to every member of the Judiciary Committee of the\r\nHouse of Representatives, with a personal letter asking for an\r\nopinion, and that not one replied. Petitions were sent from twenty\r\nStates, including suffrage associations, temperance societies,\r\ngranges, etc. Letters asking an opinion were written to nineteen\r\nSenators who were considered friendly to the enfranchisement of women,\r\nand only one answered, Joseph N. Dolph of Oregon. Miss Sara Winthrop\r\nSmith (Conn.) opened the discussion.[97]\r\n\r\nThe motion of Miss Alice Stone Blackwell to amend the constitution so\r\nthat it would not be obligatory to hold every annual convention in\r\nWashington, was amended by Mrs. Avery to the effect that \"the annual\r\ndelegate convention shall be held in Washington during the first\r\nsession of each Congress, in order to influence national legislation;\r\nthe meeting of the alternate conventions to be left an open question.\"\r\nMiss Anthony was greatly opposed to holding any of the national\r\nmeetings outside of Washington, and in a forcible speech she said:\r\n\r\n     The sole object, it seems to me, of this organization is to bring\r\n     the combined influence of all the States upon Congress to secure\r\n     national legislation. The very moment you change the purpose of\r\n     this great body from National to State work you have defeated its\r\n     object. It is the business of the States to do the district work;\r\n     to create public sentiment; to make a national organization\r\n     possible; and then to bring their united power to the capital\r\n     and focus it on Congress. Our younger women naturally can not\r\n     appreciate the vast amount of work done here in Washington by the\r\n     National Association in the last twenty-five years. The delegates\r\n     do not come here as individuals but as representatives of their\r\n     entire States.\r\n\r\n     We have had these conventions here for a quarter of a century,\r\n     and every Congress has given hearings to the ablest women we\r\n     could bring from every section. In the olden times the States\r\n     were not fully organized--they had not money enough to pay their\r\n     delegates' expenses. We begged and worked and saved the money and\r\n     the National Association paid the expenses of delegates from\r\n     Oregon and California in order that they might come and bring the\r\n     influence of their States to bear upon Congress.\r\n\r\n     Last winter we had twenty-three States represented by delegates.\r\n     Think of those twenty-three women going before the Senate\r\n     committee, each making her speech, and showing these Senators the\r\n     interest in all these States. We have educated at least a part of\r\n     three or four hundred men and their wives and daughters every two\r\n     years to return as missionaries to their respective localities. I\r\n     shall feel it a grave mistake if you vote in favor of a movable\r\n     convention. It will lessen our influence and our power; but come\r\n     what may, I shall abide by the decision of the majority.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was strongly supported by Miss Shaw, Mrs. Colby, Mrs.\r\nLouisa Southworth, Mrs. Rosa L. Segur, Mrs. Olivia B. Hall, Mrs. Jean\r\nBrooks Greenleaf and others.\r\n\r\nMrs. Claudia Quigley Murphy (O.) expressed the sentiment of the other\r\nside in saying:\r\n\r\n     It seems better to sow the seed of suffrage throughout the\r\n     country by means of our national conventions. We may give the\r\n     people mass meetings and district and State conventions and\r\n     various other things, but we can never give them anything as good\r\n     as the national convention. We must get down to the unit of our\r\n     civilization, which is the individual voter or person. We have\r\n     worked for twenty-five years here among the legislators at\r\n     Washington; we have gone to the halls of Congress and to the\r\n     Legislatures, and we have found the average legislator to be but\r\n     a reflex of the sentiment of his constituents. If we wish\r\n     representation at Washington we can send our delegation to the\r\n     halls of Congress this year and next year, the same as we have\r\n     done in the past. This great convention does not go to Congress;\r\n     it sends a committee.... Let us get down to the people and sow\r\n     the seed among them. It is the people we want to reach if we\r\n     expect good results.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was warmly advocated by Mr. and Miss Blackwell, Miss\r\nClay, Mrs. Dietrick, Mrs. Esther F. Boland and others. It was finally\r\nadopted by a vote of 37 yeas, 28 nays.\r\n\r\nAmong the many excellent State reports that of Kansas, prepared by\r\nMrs. Laura M. Johns and read by Miss Jennie, daughter of\r\nRepresentative Case Broderick, was of special interest, as a suffrage\r\ncampaign was imminent in that State and the National Association had\r\nresolved to contribute speakers and money. It spoke of the great\r\ncanvass of thirty conventions the previous year, with Mrs. Johns as\r\nchairman and a large corps of speakers from outside and inside the\r\nState; of their cordial reception by the Republican State Convention;\r\nof the benefits of Municipal Suffrage; and ended with an earnest\r\nappeal for the friends to rally to the support of Kansas.\r\n\r\nBrief remarks were made by the wives of Representatives John G. Otis\r\nof Kansas and Halbert S. Greenleaf of New York. Letters of greeting\r\nwere received from Mrs. Annie Besant of England, and many others.\r\nBishop John F. Hurst, of the Methodist Episcopal Church, in regretting\r\nthat it was impossible to accept the invitation to address the\r\nconvention, said: \"I have the fullest sympathy with your work and have\r\nhad for many years. I believe that every year brings nearer the great\r\nachievement when women will have the right of the ballot if they\r\nplease to use it.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[88] Bishop Phillips Brooks, who declared himself unequivocally for\r\nwoman suffrage, died the week following the convention.\r\n\r\n[89] See History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. II, p. 482.\r\n\r\n[90] For other instances see Life and Work of Susan B.

We\r\nalso advise that women everywhere work for the election of an equal\r\nnumber of women and men upon school boards, that the State in taking\r\nupon itself the education of children may provide them with as many\r\nofficial mothers as fathers.\r\n\r\nWHEREAS, Many forms of woman suffrage may be granted by State\r\nLegislatures without change in existing constitutions; therefore,\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That the suffragists in every State should petition for\r\nMunicipal, School and Presidential Suffrage by statute, and take every\r\npracticable step toward securing such legislation.\r\n\r\n_Resolved_, That we urge all women to enter protest, at the time of\r\npaying taxes, at being compelled to submit to taxation without\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\n[95] Rachel Foster Avery, Susan B.

Ezra B.\r\nTaylor of Ohio, was in Congress, she made it her especial business to\r\npress this matter upon the members. At least two favorable reports\r\nwere due to her efforts, and the association greatly missed her\r\ncongressional work when she left Washington.\r\n\r\n[97] The arguments for Federal Suffrage are contained in Chapter I.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XIV.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL-AMERICAN CONVENTION OF 1894.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Call for the Twenty-sixth annual convention contained this\r\nparagraph of hope and joy: \"The Government's recognition of women on\r\nthe Board of Managers for the World's Columbian Exposition; the\r\nWorld's Congress of Representative Women--the greatest convocation of\r\nwomen ever assembled; their participation in the entire series of\r\nCongresses; the gaining of Full Suffrage in Colorado--all give to our\r\ndemand for equality for women unprecedented prestige in the world of\r\nthought.\"\r\n\r\nThe meetings were held in Metzerott's Music Hall, Washington, D. C.,\r\nFeb. 15-20, 1894. An excellent summary of the week was given by the\r\nsecretary, Miss Alice Stone Blackwell, in the _Woman's Journal_, of\r\nwhich she was editor:\r\n\r\n     Over the platform was draped a large suffrage flag, bearing two\r\n     full stars for Wyoming and Colorado, and two more merely outlined\r\n     in gold for Kansas and New York, which have equal suffrage\r\n     amendments now pending and hope to add their stars to the galaxy\r\n     next November. Instead of \"Old Glory,\" the equal rights banner\r\n     might be called \"New Glory.\" Beside it hung the American flag,\r\n     the great golden flag of Spain with its two red bars, the crimson\r\n     flag of Turkey with its crescent and star, and the British\r\n     flag--these last three in honor respectively of Senorita Catalina\r\n     de Alcala of Spain, Madame Hanna Korany of Syria and Miss\r\n     Catherine Spence of Australia, who were on the program. At one\r\n     side the serene face of Lucy Stone looked down upon the audience.\r\n     On the afternoon of the memorial service the frame of the\r\n     portrait was draped with smilax, entwining bunches of violets\r\n     from South Carolina, and beneath stood a jar of great white\r\n     lilies....\r\n\r\n     Kansas and New York divided the interest of the convention, and\r\n     the importance of the two campaigns was ably presented by the\r\n     respective State presidents, stately Mrs. Greenleaf and graceful\r\n     Mrs. Johns. The appeals of the former were warmly supported by\r\n     Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake, and of the latter by Mrs. Annie L.\r\n     Diggs. Mrs. Johns is a strong Republican, and Mrs. Diggs an\r\n     equally ardent Populist, but they were perfectly agreed in their\r\n     devotion to the woman suffrage amendment and in their desire\r\n     that help should be given to the Kansas campaign. Both are small\r\n     women of gentle and feminine aspect, though known as mighty\r\n     workers; and when Mrs. Diggs, a soft-voiced, bright-eyed morsel\r\n     of humanity, said in presenting the needs of the Kansas Equal\r\n     Suffrage Association, \"Mrs. Johns is our president, and I am\r\n     vice-president; she is the gentle officer, I am the savage one;\r\n     my business is to frighten people\"--the audience roared with\r\n     laughter. The New York women generously declared that they would\r\n     carry the financial burden of their own campaign and would ask no\r\n     outside help except in speakers and sympathy. This left the field\r\n     clear for Kansas and more than $2,200 were raised at one session\r\n     towards the expenses of the campaign....\r\n\r\n     The two delegates from Colorado, Mrs. Ellis Meredith and Mrs.\r\n     Hattie E. Fox, were the objects of much interest and of hearty\r\n     congratulations. They seemed very happy over their recent\r\n     enfranchisement, as they well might be. Mrs. Meredith, who is\r\n     very small, looked up brightly at a tall Maryland lady, who was\r\n     congratulating her, and said, \"I feel as tall as you.\" These two\r\n     ladies looked just like other women and had developed no horns or\r\n     hoofs or other unamiable and unfeminine characteristics in\r\n     consequence of their having obtained the right to vote.... The\r\n     Southern women have distinguished themselves in the national\r\n     suffrage conventions during the last few years. This year, on\r\n     \"presidents' evening,\" among a number of brilliant addresses that\r\n     of Mrs. Virginia D. Young of South Carolina fairly brought down\r\n     the house....\r\n\r\n     A beautiful silk flag, bearing the two suffrage stars, was\r\n     presented to Miss Anthony in honor of her seventy-fourth\r\n     birthday, on the first evening of the convention, a gift from the\r\n     enfranchised women of Wyoming and Colorado. One of these women\r\n     had been called upon to act as a judge of elections and had\r\n     received three dollars for her services. She spent two dollars on\r\n     shoes for her little boy and sent the third dollar as her\r\n     contribution toward the suffrage flag.\r\n\r\n     It was a pleasure to see the gathering of the clans--so many good\r\n     and able and interesting women assembled together to report their\r\n     work for equal rights and to plan more for the future. One with a\r\n     pleasant, honest face and wistful brown eyes, had been lecturing\r\n     in the interest of the amendment in the country districts of New\r\n     York, riding from village to village in an open sleigh, with the\r\n     thermometer many degrees below zero, and speaking sometimes in\r\n     unwarmed halls. She did not expect to take a day's rest until the\r\n     6th of next November, and then if the amendment carried, she said\r\n     quietly, she should be willing to lie down and die....\r\n\r\n     It is pleasant also to note the increasing number of bright,\r\n     sensible, earnest young women coming from all parts of the\r\n     country to aid the older workers and to close up their thinning\r\n     ranks. The sight would be a revelation to that Massachusetts\r\n     legislator who was lately reported as saying that the petitioners\r\n     who had been asking for suffrage for so many years were fast\r\n     dying off, and soon there would be none left. He would have seen\r\n     how greatly he was reckoning without his host--or his hostesses.\r\n     A sound and righteous reform does not die with any leader,\r\n     however beloved.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Anna Howard Shaw pronounced the invocation at the opening\r\nsession. In the course of her president's address Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony said:\r\n\r\n     For the twenty-sixth time we have come together under the shadow\r\n     of the Capitol, asking that Congress shall take the necessary\r\n     steps to secure to the women of the nation their right to a voice\r\n     in the national government as well as that of their respective\r\n     States. For twelve successive Congresses we have appeared before\r\n     committees of the two Houses making this plea, that the\r\n     underlying principle of our Government, the right of consent,\r\n     shall have practical application to the other half of the people.\r\n     Such a little simple thing we have been asking for a quarter of a\r\n     century. For over forty years, longer than the children of Israel\r\n     wandered through the wilderness, we have been begging and praying\r\n     and pleading for this act of justice. We shall some day be\r\n     heeded, and when we shall have our amendment to the Constitution\r\n     of the United States, everybody will think it was always so, just\r\n     exactly as many young people believe that all the privileges, all\r\n     the freedom, all the enjoyments which woman now possesses always\r\n     were hers. They have no idea of how every single inch of ground\r\n     that she stands upon to-day has been gained by the hard work of\r\n     some little handful of women of the past.\r\n\r\nThis was Miss Anthony's birthday and Mrs. Chapman Catt concluded her\r\nlittle speech in presenting a silk flag by saying: \"And now, our\r\nbeloved leader, the enfranchised women of Wyoming and Colorado, upon\r\nthis the seventy-fourth anniversary of your life--a life every year of\r\nwhich has been devoted to the advancement of womankind--have sent this\r\nemblem and with it the message that they hope you will bear it at the\r\nhead of our armies until there shall be on this blue field not two\r\nstars but forty-four. They have sent it with the especial wish that\r\nits silent lesson shall teach such justice to the men of the State of\r\nNew York that in November they will rise as one man to crown you, as\r\nwell as their own wives and daughters, with the sovereignty of\r\nAmerican citizenship.\"\r\n\r\nFor a few moments Miss Anthony was unable to reply and then she said:\r\n\"I have heard of standard bearers in the army who carried the banner\r\nto the topmost ramparts of the enemy, and there I am going to try to\r\ncarry this one. You know without my telling how proud I am of this\r\nflag and how my heart is touched by this manifestation.\" Large boxes\r\nof flowers were sent her from Georgia and South Carolina, a telegram\r\nof greeting was received from ex-Governor and Mrs. Routt of Colorado,\r\nand there were many other pleasant remembrances.\r\n\r\nThe convention was welcomed by the Hon. John Ross, commissioner of the\r\nDistrict of Columbia. Miss Catherine H. Spence of South Australia said\r\nin speaking of the suffrage there: \"This country was not only the\r\nbirthplace of the Australian ballot, by which you now vote in the\r\nUnited States, but it was the birthplace of woman suffrage, because\r\nsix years before the Municipal Franchise was granted to women in\r\nEngland it was in effect in the towns and cities in South Australia.\"\r\nAt a later session Miss Spence gave a practical illustration of what\r\nis known as proportional representation. Miss Windeyer also\r\nrepresented the women electors of Australia.\r\n\r\nIn response to Mrs. Young, bearing the greetings of South Carolina,\r\nMiss Anthony said with much feeling:\r\n\r\n     I think the most beautiful part of our coming together in\r\n     Washington for the last twenty-five years has been that more\r\n     friendships, more knowledge of each other, have come through the\r\n     hand-shakes here than would have been possible through any other\r\n     instrumentality. I shall never cease to be grateful for all the\r\n     splendid women who have come up to this great center for these\r\n     twenty-six conventions, and have learned that the North was not\r\n     such a cold place as they had believed; I have been equally glad\r\n     when we came down here and met the women from the sunny South and\r\n     found they were just like ourselves, if not a little better. In\r\n     this great association we know no North, no South, no East, no\r\n     West. This has been our pride for all these years. We have no\r\n     political party. We never have inquired what anybody's religion\r\n     is. All we ever have asked is simply, \"Do you believe in perfect\r\n     equality for women?\" This is the one article in our creed.\r\n\r\nSenator Joseph M. Carey of Wyoming and Representative Lafayette Pence\r\nof Colorado referred with great pride to the enfranchisement of the\r\nwomen of their respective States. Mrs. Johns was introduced by Miss\r\nAnthony as \"the general of the Kansas army;\" Mrs. Greenleaf as the\r\nDemocratic nominee for member of the N. Y. Constitutional Convention;\r\nMrs. Henry as the woman who received 4,500 votes for Clerk of the\r\nSupreme Court of Kentucky. Miss Anthony's spicy introductions of the\r\nvarious speakers were always greatly relished by the audiences.\r\n\r\nNo more impressive or beautiful memorial service ever was held than\r\nthat in remembrance of Lucy Stone. The principal address was made by\r\nMrs. Julia Ward Howe (Mass.), in the course of which she said:\r\n\r\n     In all action taken under her supervision, Mrs. Stone was most\r\n     careful that the main issue should be constantly presented and\r\n     kept in view. While welcoming every reform which gave evidence of\r\n     the ethical progress of the community, she yet held to woman\r\n     suffrage, pure and simple, as the first condition upon which the\r\n     new womanhood should base itself. Efforts were often made to\r\n     entangle suffrage with the promise of endless reforms in various\r\n     directions, but firm as Cato, who always repeated his words that\r\n     Carthage should be destroyed, Lucy Stone always asked for\r\n     suffrage because it is right and just that women should have it,\r\n     and not on the ground of a swiftly-coming millennium which should\r\n     follow it....\r\n\r\n     When Lucy Stone first resolved to devote her life to the\r\n     rehabilitation of her sex, to what a task did she pledge herself!\r\n     The high road to reform which she held so dear was not even\r\n     measured before her. The ground was covered with a growth of\r\n     centuries. Could this small hand that held a sickle hope to cut\r\n     down those forests of time-honored prejudice and superstition?\r\n     What had she to work with? A silver voice, a winning smile, the\r\n     great gift of a persuasive utterance. What had she to work from?\r\n     A deep and abiding faith in divine justice and in man's ability\r\n     to follow its laws and to execute its decrees.\r\n\r\n     The prophetic sense of good to come, vouchsafed to her in the\r\n     morning of life, did not forsake her at its close. Her mind was\r\n     of a very practical cast and in her many days of labor her eyes\r\n     were always fixed upon her work. But when her work was taken from\r\n     her, she saw at once the heavens open before her and the eternal\r\n     life and light beckoning to her to go up higher. With a smile she\r\n     passed from the struggle of earthly existence to the peace of the\r\n     saints made perfect. Here she was still debarred the right to\r\n     cast her ballot at the polls, but lo, in the blue urn of heaven\r\n     her life was received, one glowing and perfect vote for the\r\n     rights of women, for the good of humanity, for the Kingdom of God\r\n     on earth.\r\n\r\nA few sentences may be given as the key-note of the eulogy of the Hon.\r\nWm. Dudley Foulke (Ind.): \"Her career, while different from that of\r\nmost women, was characterized throughout by entire and consistent\r\nwomanliness. Among the many admirable qualities that she possessed, it\r\nis difficult to single out the one for which she will hereafter be\r\nbest remembered, but as dauntless moral courage is a rarer quality\r\nperhaps than any other, it seems to me that this will remain her\r\nbrightest jewel.\"\r\n\r\nIn the address of Mrs. Josephine K. Henry (Ky.) she referred to the\r\nmarriage of Lucy Stone and Henry B. Blackwell as follows:\r\n\r\n     Their matrimonial contract is the grandest chart of the absolute\r\n     equality of man and woman that has ever been made, and it throws\r\n     a new halo of consecration and sanctity around the institution of\r\n     marriage. It has not yet been written in our ecclesiastical and\r\n     civil codes that every woman shall retain and dignify her own\r\n     name through life, but civilization is preparing now to issue\r\n     this edict. The coming woman will not resign her name at the\r\n     marriage altar, and it will be told in future years of these two\r\n     great souls who were the first to recognize the dignity of human\r\n     individuality. The domestic life of this couple who set up the\r\n     standard of absolute equality of husband and wife was an\r\n     exquisite idyl, fragrant with love and tenderness, a poem whose\r\n     rhythm was not marred, a divine melody that rose above the\r\n     discords and dissensions of domestic life upon the lowlands where\r\n     man is the ruler and woman the subject.\r\n\r\nIn the touching tribute of Miss Laura Clay (Ky.) she said: \"Lucy Stone\r\nis one of those who paid what must be paid for liberty or for any high\r\ngood of humanity. She made sacrifices and did things that none of us\r\nto-day would be called upon to do, did them bravely, did them without\r\nshrinking, did them almost without knowing that she was doing anything\r\nwhich would call forth the blessing, the gratitude of the human race.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lillie Devereux Blake (N. Y.) referred more especially to the\r\ndomestic qualities, saying:\r\n\r\n     When the gift of a little child came it was more to her than all\r\n     else beside. For a while the world centered in that tiny cradle,\r\n     and the hand which rocked that cradle had rather perform this\r\n     gentle office than rule the world. It will ever be thus. With the\r\n     true woman, dearer than wealth or fame is the touch of baby\r\n     hands, sweeter than the applause of multitudes is the ripple of a\r\n     baby's laughter. As the years passed by, the mother gave more of\r\n     her life to the public, but always with the thought of the young\r\n     girl who was growing up beside her and making of her home the\r\n     dearest and most sacred spot.\r\n\r\nThis part of the memorial services appropriately closed with the\r\ntender reminiscences of forty-five years of married life, by the\r\nhusband, Mr. Blackwell.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton (N. Y.) sent an eloquent tribute to the\r\nmemory of Lucy Stone, Leland Stanford, George W. Childs, Elizabeth\r\nOakes Smith and Elizabeth Peabody. After reciting the contributions of\r\neach in the cause of woman, she closed with these words from The\r\nPrince of India in reference to the last great record: \"There is thy\r\nhistory and mine, and all of little and great and good and bad that\r\nshall befall us in this life. Death does not blot out the records.\r\nEverlastingly writ, they shall be everlastingly read; for the shame of\r\nsome, for the glory of others.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lucretia L. Blankenburg of Philadelphia told of the loyalty to\r\nwomen of Mr. Child's paper, the _Public Ledger_, and of his many\r\nbenefactions. Frederick Douglass gave the offering of his eloquence\r\nand ended as follows:\r\n\r\n     It is not alone because of the goodness of any cause that men can\r\n     safely predicate success. Much depends on the character and\r\n     quality of the men and women who are its advocates. The Redeemer\r\n     must ever come from above. Only the best of mankind can afford to\r\n     support unpopular opinions. The common sort will drift with the\r\n     tide. No good cause can fail when supported by such women as were\r\n     Lucretia Mott, Abby Kelly, Angelina Grimke, Lydia Maria Child,\r\n     Maria W. Chapman, Thankful Southwick, Sally Holly, Ernestine L.\r\n     Rose, E. Oakes Smith, Elizabeth Peabody and the noble and gifted\r\n     Lucy Stone. Not only have we a glorious constellation of women on\r\n     the silent continent to assure us that our cause is good and that\r\n     it must finally prevail, but we have such men as William Lloyd\r\n     Garrison, Wendell Phillips, William Henry Channing, Francis\r\n     Jackson, Gerrit Smith, Samuel J. May, Samuel E. Sewall--now no\r\n     longer with us in body, but in spirit and memory to cheer us on\r\n     in the good work of lifting women in the fullest sense to the\r\n     dignity of American liberty and American citizenship.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony closed the services with heartfelt testimonials to Mrs.\r\nMyra Bradwell, one of the first woman lawyers and founder and editor\r\nof _The Legal News_; Miss Mary F. Seymour, founder of _The Business\r\nWoman's Journal_; and Col. John Thompson, a founder of the Patrons of\r\nHusbandry, the first national organization of men to indorse woman\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nAt one of the evening sessions Miss Anthony presented Dr. John\r\nTrimble, secretary of the National Grange, and Leonard Rhone,\r\nchairman of its executive committee. The latter said in course of a\r\nfew brief remarks: \"When the farmers of this country organized they\r\ntook with them their wives and daughters, and for twenty-seven years\r\nwe have tried woman suffrage in the Grange and it has worked well.\r\nWhat we have demonstrated by experience in our organization we are\r\nready to indorse, and by almost a unanimous vote at our last national\r\nconvention we passed a resolution in favor of woman suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Orra Langhorne read a clever paper on House Cleaning in Old\r\nVirginia, describing present social and political conditions and\r\nshowing the need of woman's participation. Mrs. Mary Lowe Dickinson\r\n(N. Y.), secretary of the King's Daughters, gave a talk which sparkled\r\nwith anecdotes and illustrations, every one scoring a point for woman\r\nsuffrage. Madame Hanna Korany, from Syria, told in her soft, broken\r\nEnglish how the women of the old world looked to those of America to\r\nfree them from the slavery of customs and laws.\r\n\r\nMrs. Miriam Howard DuBose took for her subject Some Georgia\r\nCuriosities, which she showed to be \"men who love women too dearly to\r\naccord them justice; women who are deceived by such affection; the\r\nself-supporting woman, who crowds all places where there is any money\r\nto be made without encountering the masculine frown and declares she\r\nhas all the rights she wants. Georgia's motto should read: Unwisdom,\r\nInjustice, Immoderation.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Harriet A. Shinn (Ills.), president of the National Association\r\nof Women Stenographers, gave unanswerable testimony from employers in\r\nmany different kinds of business expressing a preference for women\r\nstenographers. Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates (Me.) illustrated how class\r\ndistinctions, public schools, religious liberty and social life have\r\nbeen affected by the thought of the times, by fashionable thought. The\r\nofficial report said: \"So bristling with humor was this address that\r\nthere were several times when the speaker had to stop and wait for the\r\nlaughter to subside. At the conclusion, her effort was acknowledged by\r\nlong applause.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Shaw closed an evening which had been full of mirth, saying in\r\nthe course of her vivacious remarks:\r\n\r\n     I spoke at a woman's club in Philadelphia yesterday and a young\r\n     lady said to me afterwards: \"Well, that sounds very nice, but\r\n     don't you think it is better to be the power behind the throne?\"\r\n     I answered that I had not had much experience with thrones, but a\r\n     woman who has been on a throne, and who is now behind it, seems\r\n     to prefer to be on the throne.[98] Mr. Edward Bok, editor of the\r\n     _Ladies' Home Journal_, says that by careful watching for many\r\n     years, he has come to the conclusion that no woman has had any\r\n     business relations with men who has not been contaminated by\r\n     them; and this same individual who does not want us to have\r\n     business relations with men, lest we be contaminated by the\r\n     association, wants us to marry these same men and live with them\r\n     three hundred and sixty-five and one-fourth days a year!\r\n\r\nOn Sunday Mrs. Chapman Catt gave a sermon in the People's Church, Mrs.\r\nEllen Battelle Dietrick in All Soul's Church (Unitarian), and the Rev.\r\nAnna Howard Shaw in Metzerott's Music Hall. At the last named meeting\r\nMrs. Howe offered the prayer and, at the close, recited her Battle\r\nHymn of the Republic. Miss Shaw preached from the text, \"Let no man\r\ntake thy crown.\"\r\n\r\n     ....Since the beginning of the Christian era those who have\r\n     expounded the Scriptures have been principally men, and the\r\n     Gospel has been presented to us from the standpoint of men. In\r\n     all these interpretations Heaven has been peopled with men, God\r\n     has been pictured as a man, and even the earth has been\r\n     represented as masculine.\r\n\r\n     In the beginning this was wise, because people have always been\r\n     more impressed by law, order, system and government than by the\r\n     spirit of faith. But we have passed the stage of force in nature,\r\n     of force in physical life, and have arrived at the age of\r\n     spiritual thought and earthly needs when the mother comes to the\r\n     front. In the Old World I have seen venerable men, strong men,\r\n     and women kneeling together at the shrine of Mary pouring out\r\n     their sufferings into the mother heart of the Virgin and rising\r\n     refreshed and solaced. What Catholicism has done for its church,\r\n     Protestantism must do for Christianity everywhere, by revealing\r\n     the mother-life and the mother-spirit of divine nature. In the\r\n     lesson of life there is not only a father but a mother-love.\r\n\r\n     Jesus Christ, we are told, was a man and so were His disciples,\r\n     and this is given as the reason why men only should preach the\r\n     Gospel, yet the Scriptures tell us that the first\r\n     divinely-ordained preacher was a woman. All the way down in the\r\n     history of Christianity are found women side by side with men,\r\n     always ready and willing to bear the burdens and sorrows of life\r\n     in order to better their fellows. In this country every\r\n     reformation has been urged by women as well as men. The names of\r\n     William Lloyd Garrison and Wendell Phillips will go down to\r\n     posterity linked with those of Lucretia Mott, Harriet Beecher\r\n     Stowe and Susan B. Anthony. In the great temperance movement the\r\n     name of Gough will at once bring to mind Frances E. Willard.\r\n     There is no name more prominently identified in the effort to\r\n     uplift the Indian than that of Helen Hunt Jackson. Wherever there\r\n     has been a wrong committed there have always been women to defend\r\n     the wronged. Julia Ward Howe gave us the \"Battle Hymn of the\r\n     Republic,\" while Lucy Stone's last words should be the motto of\r\n     every young girl's life, \"Make the world better.\"\r\n\r\n     With respect to my text, \"Let no man take thy crown,\" these words\r\n     were written to the church, and not to the men alone, and the\r\n     command should be obeyed by every woman. If the churches then\r\n     were anything like the churches of to-day, they were composed of\r\n     three-fourths women. Hence this injunction was intended\r\n     especially for women. This crown, I take it, means the crown of\r\n     righteousness, of regeneration, of redemption, of purity, and\r\n     applies to the whole body of the church. I believe the crown of\r\n     womanhood in its highest sense means womanly character and\r\n     nature. We never can wear a higher or nobler crown than pure and\r\n     womanly womanhood....\r\n\r\n     The world has always been more particular how we did things than\r\n     what things we did.... All human beings are under obligations\r\n     first to themselves. If self-sacrifice seems best, then we should\r\n     practice that; while if self-assertion seems best, then we should\r\n     assert ourselves. The abominable doctrine taught in the pulpit,\r\n     the press, in books and elsewhere, is that the whole duty of\r\n     women is self-abasement and self-sacrifice. I do not believe\r\n     subjection is woman's duty any more than it is the duty of a man\r\n     to be under subjection to another man or to many men. Women have\r\n     the right of independence, of conscience, of will and of\r\n     responsibility.\r\n\r\n     Women are robbed of themselves by the laws of the country and by\r\n     fashion. The time has not passed when women are bought and sold.\r\n     Social custom makes the world a market-place in which women are\r\n     bought and sold, and sometimes they are given away. In the\r\n     marriage ceremony woman loses her name, and under the old Common\r\n     Law a married woman had no legal rights. She occupied the same\r\n     position to her husband as the slave to his master. These things\r\n     degraded marriage, but the home would be the holiest of spots if\r\n     the wife asserted her individuality and worked hand-in-hand with\r\n     her husband, each uplifting the other. Women are robbed of the\r\n     right of conscience. Their silence and subjection in the church\r\n     have been the curse not only of womanhood but of manhood. No\r\n     other human being should decide for us in questions pertaining to\r\n     our own moral and spiritual welfare. Women are beginning to\r\n     believe that God will listen to a woman as quickly as to a man.\r\n     The time has come when councils of women will gather and do their\r\n     work in their quiet way without regard to men.\r\n\r\n     No person is human who may not \"will\" to be anything he can be.\r\n     When the woman says \"I will,\" there is not anything this side of\r\n     the throne of God to stop her, and the girls of the present day\r\n     should learn this lesson. Now there is placed upon women the\r\n     obligation of service without the responsibility of their\r\n     actions. The man who leads feels the responsibility of his acts,\r\n     and this urges him to make them noble. Women should have this\r\n     same responsibility and be made to feel it. The most dangerous\r\n     thing in the world is power without responsibility....\r\n\r\nMonday night's session was designated \"president's evening\" and many\r\nshort, clever talks were given.[99] James L. Hughes, Superintendent of\r\nSchools in Toronto and president of the Equal Suffrage Association of\r\nthat city, told how the women of Canada voted, sat on the public and\r\nHigh School boards and even served as president of the Toronto board.\r\n\r\nAt the Tuesday evening meeting Miss Anthony introduced Senator W. A.\r\nPeffer and Representatives Jerry Simpson, John C. Davis, Case\r\nBroderick and Charles Curtis of Kansas, and Henry A. Coffeen of\r\nWyoming. Ex-Senator Blanche K. Bruce of Mississippi was invited to the\r\nplatform and responded by saying he hoped to see the day when every\r\nqualified woman could exercise the suffrage. The Hon. Simon Wolf,\r\ncommissioner of the District, urged equality of rights for women.\r\n\r\nGrace Greenwood was presented as one of the pioneer woman suffragists.\r\nMrs. Mary Seymour Howell (N. Y.), the heroine of many campaigns, in a\r\nstirring speech related her varied experiences and said: \"Ours is one\r\nof the greatest wars of the centuries. Indeed, it is a continuation of\r\nthe same battle which has been waged almost since the world began but\r\ncarried on with different tactics. It stands unique. No cannon is\r\nheard. No smoke tells of defeat or victory. No bloody battlefields\r\nlift their blushing faces to the heavens. It is a battle of ideas, a\r\nbattle of prejudices, the right and the wrong, the new and the old,\r\nmeeting in close contact. It is the 'war of the roses,' if you so\r\nplease to call it. It is the motherhood of the republic asking for\r\nfull political recognition.\"\r\n\r\nThe last address of the convention was made by the Rev. Ida C. Hultin,\r\non the Crowning Race, whose men and women should be equally free. Gov.\r\nDavis H. Waite of Colorado sent a letter in relation to the\r\nenfranchising of women the previous year, in which he said:\r\n\r\n     The Populists more than any other political party in Colorado\r\n     favored equal suffrage, but many Republicans and Democrats also\r\n     voted for it, and in my opinion the result may be considered as\r\n     due to the enlightened public sentiment of the common people of\r\n     the State. The more I consider the matter the more it grows upon\r\n     me in importance, and the more I realize the fact that all the\r\n     patriotism, all the intelligence and all the virtue of the\r\n     commonwealth are necessary to preserve it from the corrupt and\r\n     mercenary attacks made upon it from all points by corporate\r\n     trusts and monopolies. Equal suffrage can not fail to encourage\r\n     purity in both private and public life, and to elevate the\r\n     official standard of fitness.\r\n\r\nA letter from Mrs. May Wright Sewall, regretting her enforced absence,\r\nclosed by saying:\r\n\r\n     Many of you know that the last few months I have spent in editing\r\n     the papers presented at the World's Congress of Representative\r\n     Women, held in Chicago last May. It is a remarkable and to me\r\n     quite an unexpected fact that the papers upon the subject of\r\n     Civil and Political Reform are hardly more earnest appeals for\r\n     political equality than are the addresses to be found in every\r\n     other chapter. Hereafter if one asserts that the interest in the\r\n     woman suffrage movement is not growing, let him be cited to this\r\n     galaxy of witnesses, whose testimony is all the more valuable\r\n     because in the large majority of instances it proceeds from women\r\n     who never have identified themselves with it, and are not at all\r\n     known as advocates of political equality. The meaning of the\r\n     entire report is equality, co-operation, organization; that is,\r\n     the demand made by the National Suffrage Association is the\r\n     demand borne to us by the echoes of that great congress.\r\n\r\nAmong the committee reports that of Mrs. Rachel Foster Avery, Chairman\r\nof Columbian Exposition Work, attracted especial attention and was in\r\npart as follows:\r\n\r\n     There is a most valuable and interesting bit of unpublished\r\n     history which seems to me to form an integral part of your\r\n     committee's report. It concerns the origin of the Board of Lady\r\n     Managers, and this association should be proud to be able to feel\r\n     that to our president is largely due the recognition of women in\r\n     official capacity at the World's Fair. The fact that women were\r\n     not officially recognized during the Centennial Exposition in\r\n     1876 was a great disappointment to all interested in the\r\n     advancement of womankind, and while it was suggested on every\r\n     side that women must have a voice in the management of the\r\n     World's Fair in 1893, it remained for Susan B. Anthony to take\r\n     the initiatory step which led to the creation of the Board of\r\n     Lady Managers. She had invitations sent to women of official and\r\n     social position to meet in the Riggs House parlors to consider\r\n     this matter, in December, 1889. At this meeting Mrs. Conger, wife\r\n     of Senator Omar D. Conger of Michigan, was made chairman, and\r\n     Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, secretary. Miss Anthony was not\r\n     present, fearing lest her well-known radical views might hinder\r\n     the progress of affairs in the direction she wished them to take,\r\n     but she restlessly walked about her room in the hotel anxiously\r\n     awaiting the result.\r\n\r\n     Several meetings followed this and a committee was appointed to\r\n     wait upon Congress, asking that the commission should consist of\r\n     both men and women. Meanwhile the World's Fair Bill had been\r\n     brought before the House and Miss Anthony soon saw that there\r\n     would not be time for this committee to act. She therefore\r\n     prepared petitions, sent them to women in official life and asked\r\n     them to obtain signatures of official people.[100] On the\r\n     strength of these petitions there was added to the bill, in\r\n     March, 1890, an amendment providing for the appointment of women\r\n     on the Board.\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony's self-effacement was perhaps the wisest thing under\r\n     the circumstances, for the Board, as appointed, being unconnected\r\n     with woman suffrage, proved an immense source of education to the\r\n     conservative women of the whole world--an education not needed by\r\n     the radical women of our own ranks. I think the time has surely\r\n     come when the truth of this history should be known to all.\r\n\r\nThe election of officers resulted in Miss Anthony's receiving\r\nfor president 139 out of 140 possible votes; Miss Shaw for\r\nvice-president-at-large, 130; Rachel Foster Avery for corresponding\r\nsecretary, unanimous; Alice Stone Blackwell for recording secretary,\r\n136; Harriet Taylor Upton for treasurer, unanimous.\r\n\r\nDuring the convention the death of Miss Anna Ella Carroll was\r\nannounced. A resolution of sympathy with her sister was adopted and a\r\ncollection was taken up, as had been done for Miss Carroll a number\r\nof times during the past twenty-five years, which resulted in over\r\nforty dollars.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sallie Clay Bennett (Ky.), the faithful champion of Federal\r\nSuffrage, insisted that, instead of asking for an amendment to confer\r\nsuffrage, we should demand protection in the right already guaranteed\r\nby the U. S. Constitution: \"Even when asking for Municipal Suffrage,\r\nwe never should fail to assert that it is already ours under the\r\nConstitution, and that there is strength enough in our national\r\ngovernment to protect every woman in the Union provided the men had\r\ninterpreted the laws right.\" Miss Sara Winthrop Smith (Conn.)\r\nsupported Mrs. Bennett, saying: \"It is useless labor to petition for a\r\nSixteenth Amendment--we do not need it. Our fundamental institutions\r\nmost adequately protect the rights of all citizens of the United\r\nStates, irrespective of sex. In the twenty-four years since the\r\npassage of the Fifteenth Amendment, 300 amendments to the Constitution\r\nhave been introduced into Congress which never met with any approval\r\nfrom either House. I think it is wasted time for us to continue in\r\nthis work, and therefore I feel that it concerns our dignity as a part\r\nof the people of this great United States that we declare and ask only\r\nfor that which recognizes the dignity of such citizens.\" Mrs. Diggs,\r\nMrs. Dietrick, Mrs. Colby and others supported this view.\r\n\r\nIn expressing his dissent Mr. Blackwell said: \"I do not believe in\r\nFederal Suffrage. I agree with the State's Rights party in their\r\nviews.\" Miss Blackwell and others took the same position, and Miss\r\nAnthony closed the debate by saying: \"There is no doubt that the\r\nspirit of the Constitution guarantees full equality of rights and the\r\nprotection of citizens of the United States in the exercise of these\r\nrights, but the powers that be have decided against us, and until we\r\ncan get a broader Supreme Court--which will not be until after the\r\nwomen of every State in the Union are enfranchised--we never will get\r\nthe needed liberal interpretation of that document.\" The majority\r\nconcurred in this view.\r\n\r\nThe most spirited discussion of the convention was in regard to the\r\nplace of holding the next annual meeting. Urgent invitations were\r\nreceived from Detroit and Cincinnati, but the persuasive Southern\r\nadvocates, Claudia Howard Maxwell, Miriam Howard DuBose and H. Augusta\r\nHoward, three Georgia delegates, carried off the prize for Atlanta.\r\n\r\nThis was the first and last appearance on the suffrage platform of\r\nMiss Kate Field, who was introduced by Miss Anthony with her\r\ncharacteristic abruptness: \"Now, friends, here is Kate Field, who has\r\nbeen talking all these years against woman suffrage. She wants to tell\r\nyou of the faith that is in her.\" Miss Field responded quickly:\r\n\r\n     I take exception to what Miss Anthony has said, because I think\r\n     she has misconstrued my position entirely. I never have been\r\n     against woman suffrage. I have been against universal suffrage of\r\n     any kind, regardless of sex. I think that morally woman has\r\n     exactly as much right to the suffrage as man. It is a disgrace\r\n     that such women as you and I have not the suffrage, but I do\r\n     think that all suffrage should be regarded as a privilege and\r\n     should not be demanded as a right. It should be the privilege of\r\n     education and, if you please--I will not quarrel about that--of a\r\n     certain property qualification. I have not changed my opinion,\r\n     but I did say that I was tired of waiting for men to have common\r\n     sense, that there evidently never would be any restriction in\r\n     suffrage and that I should come in for the whole thing, woman\r\n     included. Now, that is my position.... I withdraw my former\r\n     attitude and take my stand on this platform.\r\n\r\nThe usual able \"hearings\" were held. Before the Senate\r\ncommittee--Senators Hoar, Teller, Wolcott, Blackburn and Hill--the\r\nspeakers were the Rev. Ida C. Hultin, Miss Blackwell, Mrs. Lucretia\r\nMitchell, Mrs. Diggs, Mrs. Phoebe C. Wright, Miss Alice Smith, Mrs.\r\nBennett, Mrs. Colby, Representative John C. Davis of Kansas. Although\r\nthe majority of the committee were in favor of woman suffrage no\r\nreport was made.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Isaac H. Goodnight (Ky.) was in the chair of the House\r\nJudiciary Committee, which was addressed by the Reverends Miss Shaw\r\nand Miss Hultin, Mrs. Young, Mrs. Emily G. Ketcham, Miss Lavina A.\r\nHatch, Prof. Jennie Gifford, Mrs. Alice Waugh, Mrs. Pickler, Miss\r\nHoward, Mrs. Meredith, Mrs. Greenleaf, Mr. Blackwell. Miss Anthony\r\npresented the speakers and closed the discussion. Later Mr. Goodnight\r\nsubmitted an adverse report for a majority of the committee.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[98] The Hawaiian ex-queen, then in the United States endeavoring to\r\nhave her throne restored to her.\r\n\r\n[99] Among the speakers were Mrs. Mary L. Bennett, Mrs. Lucretia L.\r\nBlankenburg, Miss Laura Clay, Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby, Mrs. Etta\r\nGrymes Farrah, Mrs. Jean Brooks Greenleaf, Mrs. Florence Howe Hall,\r\nMrs. Rebecca Henry Hayes, Mrs. Laura M. Johns, Mrs. Emily B. Ketcham,\r\nMrs. Claudia Howard Maxwell, Mrs. Ellis Meredith, Mrs. Mary Bentley\r\nThomas, Mrs. Emmeline B. Wells, Mrs. Virginia D. Young.\r\n\r\n[100] Miss Anthony herself also went among prominent persons of her\r\nown acquaintance obtaining signatures. In a few days 111 names were\r\nsecured of the wives and daughters of Judges of the Supreme Court, the\r\nCabinet, Senators, Representatives, Army and Navy officers--as\r\ninfluential a list as the national capital could offer. These names\r\nmay be found in the published minutes of this convention of 1894, p.\r\n135.\r\n\r\nAt the time Miss Anthony secured this petition no organization of\r\nwomen had considered the question and, if she had not been on the\r\nground and taken immediate action, there is every reason to believe\r\nthat the bill would have passed Congress without any provision for a\r\nboard of women. For a further account of this matter, and for a\r\ndescription of this great Congress of Women, see Life and Work of\r\nSusan B. Anthony, Chap. XLI; also chapter on Illinois in this volume\r\nof the History.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XV.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL-AMERICAN CONVENTION OF 1895.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Twenty-seventh annual convention--Jan. 31-Feb. 5, 1895--possessed\r\nan unusual interest because of its being held outside of Washington.\r\nThe American society had been accustomed to migratory conventions, but\r\nthe National had gone to the capital for twenty-six winters. The\r\n_Woman's Journal_, whose editors were strongly in favor of the former\r\nplan, said of the Atlanta meeting:\r\n\r\n     There had been some fears that holding the convention so far\r\n     south might result in a smaller attendance of delegates than\r\n     usual; but there were ninety-three delegates, representing\r\n     twenty-eight States, and also a large number of visitors. Some,\r\n     like Mrs. Abigail Scott Duniway of Oregon, had come nearly 4,000\r\n     miles to be present. De Give's Opera House was crowded. Even at\r\n     the morning meetings the seats were full and men stood for hours,\r\n     several rows deep all around the sides and back of the house--a\r\n     novel and gratifying sight at a business meeting. The proportion\r\n     of men among the delegates and in the audiences, both day and\r\n     evening, was larger than usual....\r\n\r\n     Over the platform hung two large flags, that of the association,\r\n     with the two stars of Wyoming and Colorado, and another flag, the\r\n     work of Georgia ladies, on which was ingeniously depicted the\r\n     relative standing of the different States on this question. The\r\n     States where women have no form of suffrage were represented by\r\n     black stars. Those where they can vote for school committee or on\r\n     certain local questions had a golden rim. Kansas and Iowa had a\r\n     wider golden rim, to indicate municipal and bond suffrage.\r\n     Wyoming and Colorado shone with full and undimmed luster.\r\n     Portraits of Lucy Stone and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, draped in\r\n     yellow, adorned opposite sides of the platform.\r\n\r\n     Many of the delegates were from the Southern States, and some of\r\n     them strikingly illustrated Miss Anthony's assertion, \"These\r\n     Southern women are born orators.\" In sweetness of voice, grace of\r\n     manner and personal charm they have all the qualities to make\r\n     most effective speakers, while in the fervor of their equal\r\n     rights sentiments they go even beyond their sisters from the\r\n     North and West. One handsome young lady, who sat on the platform\r\n     a good deal of the time, was supposed to be from New England,\r\n     because she wore her hair short. It turned out, however, that she\r\n     was from New Orleans and was a cousin of Jefferson Davis. The\r\n     announcement of this fact caused her to be received by the\r\n     audience with roars of enthusiasm.\r\n\r\n     The Atlanta papers devoted columns every day to friendly reports\r\n     and innumerable portraits. Ministers of different denominations\r\n     opened the convention with prayer and their pulpits afterwards\r\n     for addresses by the ladies. Some of the best people of the city\r\n     took visitors into their homes, entertaining them hospitably and\r\n     delightfully, and showing them what a Southern home is like. The\r\n     national officers and speakers were entertained by the Georgia W.\r\n     S. A. at the Aragon, and the State officers generously insisted\r\n     upon taking almost the entire expenses of the great convention\r\n     upon their own young shoulders. These \"Georgia girls\" devoted\r\n     unlimited time, thought and work to getting up the convention,\r\n     and then effaced themselves as far as possible....[101]\r\n\r\n     Perhaps no one person did more, unintentionally, to promote the\r\n     enthusiasm of the convention than the Rev. Dr. Hawthorne, a\r\n     Baptist preacher. He had felt called upon to denounce all woman\r\n     suffragists from his pulpit, not only with severity but with\r\n     discourtesy, and had been so misguided as to declare that the\r\n     husbands of suffragists were all feeble-minded men. As the\r\n     average equal-rights woman is firmly convinced that her husband\r\n     is the very best man in the world, this remark stirred the women\r\n     up to a degree of wrath which no amount of abuse leveled against\r\n     themselves would have aroused. On the other hand, the Atlanta\r\n     people, even those who were not in favor of suffrage, felt\r\n     mortified by this unprovoked insult to their guests, and many of\r\n     them took occasion in private to express their regret. Several\r\n     speakers at the convention criticised Dr. Hawthorne's utterances,\r\n     and every such allusion was received with warm applause by the\r\n     audience....\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the convention four announcements were made which\r\nadded much to the general good cheer--that South Australia had\r\nfollowed the example of New Zealand in extending Full Suffrage to\r\nwomen; that the Supreme Court of Ohio had pronounced the School\r\nSuffrage Law constitutional; that the Governor of Illinois had filled\r\na vacancy on the Board of Trustees of the State University by\r\nappointing a woman; that the Idaho Legislature had submitted a woman\r\nsuffrage amendment.\r\n\r\nThe most perfect arrangements had been made for the meetings, and the\r\nnovelty of the occasion attracted large crowds, but there was also\r\nmuch genuine interest. The success was partly due to the excellent\r\nwork of the press of Atlanta. There was, however, no editorial\r\nendorsement except by _The Sunny South_, Col. Henry Clay Fairman,\r\neditor.\r\n\r\nThe national president, Miss Susan B. Anthony, said in opening the\r\nconvention: \"With this gavel was called to order in 1869 that\r\nLegislature of Wyoming which established the first true republic under\r\nthe Stars and Stripes and gave the franchise to what men call the\r\nbetter-half of the people. We women do not say that, but we do claim\r\nto be half.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony seldom made a stated address either in opening or\r\nclosing, but throughout the entire convention kept up a running fire\r\nof quaint, piquant, original and characteristic observations which\r\ndelighted the audience and gave a distinctive attraction to the\r\nmeetings. It was impossible to keep a record of these and they would\r\nlose their zest and appropriateness if separated from the\r\ncircumstances which called them forth. They can not be transmitted to\r\nfuture generations, but the thousands who heard them during the fifty\r\nyears of her itineracy will preserve them among their delightful\r\nmemories. Perfectly at home on the platform, she would indulge in the\r\nsame informality of remarks which others use in private conversation,\r\nbut always with a quick wit, a fine satire and a keen discrimination.\r\nWords of praise or criticism were given with equal impartiality, and\r\naccepted with a grace which would have been impossible had the giver\r\nbeen any other than the recognized Mentor of them all. Her wonderful\r\npower of reminiscence never failed, and she had always some personal\r\nrecollection of every speaker or of her parents or other relatives.\r\nShe kept the audience in continuous good-humor and furnished a variety\r\nto the program of which the newspaper reporters joyfully availed\r\nthemselves. At the morning business meetings which were always\r\ninformal there would often be a running dialogue something like the\r\nfollowing, when Mrs. Alberta C. Taylor was called to the platform:\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY: This is an Alabama girl, transplanted to the\r\n     Rockies--a daughter of Governor Chapman of Alabama. She is as\r\n     good a Southerner as any one, and also as good a Northerner and\r\n     Westerner.\r\n\r\n     MRS. TAYLOR: A Southern paper lately said no Southern woman\r\n     could read the report of the late election in Colorado without\r\n     blushing. I went through the election itself without blushing,\r\n     except with gratification.\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY: Instead of degrading a woman it makes her feel\r\n     nobler not to be counted with idiots, lunatics and criminals. It\r\n     even changes the expression of her face.\r\n\r\n     VOICE IN THE AUDIENCE: How many women are there in the Colorado\r\n     Legislature?\r\n\r\n     MRS. TAYLOR: Three.\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY: It has always been thought perfectly womanly to be\r\n     a scrub-woman in the Legislature and to take care of the\r\n     spittoons; that is entirely within the charmed circle of woman's\r\n     sphere; but for women to occupy any of those official seats would\r\n     be degrading.\r\n\r\n     MISS LUCY E. ANTHONY: What salaries do the women legislators\r\n     receive?\r\n\r\n     MRS. TAYLOR: The same as the men, $4 a day. The pay of our\r\n     legislators is small. A prosperous business man has to make a\r\n     great sacrifice to go to the Legislature, and we can not always\r\n     get the best men to serve. This is an additional reason for\r\n     making women eligible. There are more first-class women than\r\n     first-class men who have the leisure.\r\n\r\n     MISS SHAW: We are accused of wishing to belittle men, but in\r\n     Colorado they think a man's time is worth only as much as a\r\n     woman's.\r\n\r\n     MRS. CLARA B. COLBY: The Hon. Mrs. Holley has just introduced in\r\n     the Colorado House, and carried through it against strong\r\n     opposition, a bill raising the age of protection for girls to\r\n     eighteen years.\r\n\r\n     MRS. DUNIWAY: I was in the Colorado House and saw it done. The\r\n     women members are highly respected. I have never seen women so\r\n     honored since those of Washington were disfranchised. The leading\r\n     men are as proud of the enfranchisement of their women as Georgia\r\n     men will be when the time comes. The Colorado women have\r\n     organized a Good Government League to promote education,\r\n     sanitation and general prosperity.\r\n\r\n     MRS. TAYLOR: A bookseller in Denver told me that since women were\r\n     given the suffrage he had sold more books on political economy\r\n     than he had sold since Colorado was admitted into the Union.\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY: The bill raising the age of protection for girls\r\n     shows that suffrage does not make a woman forget her children,\r\n     and the bookseller's remark shows that she will study the science\r\n     of government.\r\n\r\n     MRS. MARY BENTLEY THOMAS: One of our most conservative Maryland\r\n     women, who married in Colorado ten years ago, writes to me: \"I\r\n     enjoyed every moment of the campaign, especially the primary\r\n     meetings.\" A Virginia woman who also married a Colorado man\r\n     writes back: \"Come West, where women are appreciated, and where\r\n     they are proud and happy citizens.\" She adds: \"If you will come\r\n     I will show you the sweetest girl baby you ever saw.\"\r\n\r\n     MRS. HENRY: Let it be recorded that the first bill introduced by\r\n     a woman member in any State Legislature was a bill for the\r\n     protection of girls.\r\n\r\n     On motion of Mrs. Colby, it was voted to send a telegram of\r\n     congratulation to the Hon. Mrs. Holley.\r\n\r\nAgain:\r\n\r\n     Before introducing the president of the Florida W. S. A. Miss\r\n     Anthony said: \"For several years a big box of oranges has come to\r\n     me from Florida. Not long ago, I got home on one of the coldest\r\n     nights of the year, and found a box standing in my woodshed, full\r\n     of magnificent oranges. Next morning the papers reported that all\r\n     the oranges in Florida were frozen; but the president of the\r\n     suffrage association saved that boxful for me.\"\r\n\r\n     MRS. ELLA C. CHAMBERLAIN: Those were all we saved.... A man in\r\n     Florida who hires himself and his wife out to hoe corn, charges\r\n     $1.25 for his own services and 75 cents for hers, although she\r\n     does just as much work as he, so the men who employ them tell me.\r\n     It costs his wife 50 cents a day to be a woman.\r\n\r\n     VOICE IN THE AUDIENCE: And the 75 cents paid for her work belongs\r\n     to her husband.\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY: I suppose those are colored men.\r\n\r\n     MRS. CHAMBERLAIN: No, they are white.\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY: White men have always controlled their wives'\r\n     wages. Colored men were not able to do so until they themselves\r\n     became free. Then they owned both their wives and their wages.\r\n\r\nThe delegate from the District of Columbia answered in a very faint\r\ntone of voice, and Miss Anthony remarked that \"this was through\r\nmortification because even the men there had no more rights than\r\nwomen.\" When another delegate could not be heard she said: \"Women have\r\nalways been taught that it is immodest to speak in a loud voice, and\r\nit is hard for them to get out of the old rut.\" At another time:\r\n\r\n     MISS LAVINA A. HATCH: In Massachusetts there are between 103,000\r\n     and 105,000 families which have no male head. Some of these pay\r\n     large taxes and none of them has any representation.\r\n\r\n     MRS. MARIANA W. CHAPMAN: In about two-thirds of the State of New\r\n     York, and not including New York City, women are assessed on\r\n     $348,177,107.\r\n\r\n     MRS. LOUISA SOUTHWORTH: This year, with the new income tax, I\r\n     shall pay in taxes, national, State and municipal, $5,300.\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY: Yet why should she have a right to vote?\r\n     Inconsistency is the jewel of the American people.\r\n\r\n     MRS. MERIWETHER: Tennessee caps the climax in taxation without\r\n     representation. In Shelby County there are two young women,\r\n     sisters, who own farms. Both are married, and both were sensible\r\n     enough to have their farms secured to themselves and their\r\n     children. In one case, at least, it proved a wise precaution. One\r\n     of these young women asked the other, when she went to town, to\r\n     pay a few bills for her and settle her taxes. Accordingly she\r\n     went to the tax office, and as she handed in the papers she\r\n     noticed written at the foot of her sister's tax bill, \"Poll tax,\r\n     $1.00.\" She exclaimed, \"Oh, when did Mrs. A. become a voter? I am\r\n     so glad Tennessee has granted suffrage to women!\" \"Oh, she\r\n     hasn't; it doesn't,\" said the young clerk with a smile. \"That is\r\n     her husband's poll tax.\" \"And why is she required to pay her\r\n     husband's poll tax?\" \"It is the custom,\" he said. She replied,\r\n     \"Then Tennessee will change its custom this time. I will see the\r\n     tax collector dead and very cold before I will pay Mr. A.'s poll\r\n     tax out of my sister's property in order that he may vote, while\r\n     she is not allowed to do so!\"\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY: It seems to me that these Southern women are in a\r\n     state of chronic rebellion.\r\n\r\n     MRS. MERIWETHER: We are.\r\n\r\nIn closing this meeting Miss Anthony said: \"Now, don't all of you come\r\nto me to tell me how glad you are that I have worked for fifty years,\r\nbut say rather that you are going to begin work yourselves.\"\r\n\r\nThe delegates were eloquently welcomed in behalf of the South by\r\nBennett J. Conyers of Atlanta, who declared that \"suffrage for women\r\nis demanded by the divine law of human development.\" He said in part:\r\n\r\n     The work of Miss Anthony needs no apology. She has blazed a way\r\n     for advanced thought in her lonely course over the red-hot\r\n     plowshares of resistance. Now almost at the summit she looks back\r\n     to see following her an army with banners. May she long worship\r\n     where she stands at Truth's mountain altar, as, with the royal\r\n     sunset flush upon her brow, she catches the beckoning of the\r\n     lights twinkling on the heavenly shore.... The South is a maiden\r\n     well worthy of the allegiance of this cause, and when her aid is\r\n     given it will be as devoted as it has been reserved. The South is\r\n     the land where has lingered latest on earth the chivalry which\r\n     idealized its objects of worship. What though it may have meant\r\n     repression? Is it any wonder that the tender grace of a day that\r\n     is dead even now lingers and makes men loath to welcome change?\r\n     Perhaps it can not be told how much it has cost men to surrender\r\n     the ideal, even though it be to change it for the perfected\r\n     womanhood....\r\n\r\nThe address of welcome for the State was made by Mrs. Mary L.\r\nMcLendon, who spoke earnestly in favor of equal suffrage, saying:\r\n\r\n     If Georgia women could vote, this National Convention could hold\r\n     its session in our million dollar capitol, which rears its grand\r\n     proportions on yonder hill. Crowning its loftiest pinnacle is the\r\n     statue of a woman representing Liberty, and on its front the\r\n     motto, \"Justice, Wisdom and Moderation.\" It was built with money\r\n     paid into our State's treasury by women as well as men, both\r\n     white and black; but men alone, white and black, have the\r\n     privilege of meeting in legislative session to make laws to\r\n     govern women. Men are also allowed to hold their Democratic,\r\n     Republican, Prohibition and Populist Conventions in its halls. It\r\n     is with difficulty that women can secure a hearing before a\r\n     legislative committee to petition for laws to ameliorate their\r\n     own condition, or to secure compulsory training in the public\r\n     schools, that their children may be brought up in the way they\r\n     should go, and become sober, virtuous citizens.\r\n\r\nMajor Charles W. Hubner extended the welcome of the city, saying in\r\nconclusion: \"Reason and right are with you, and these, in the name of\r\nGod, will at last prevail.\" Afterwards he contributed the poem, \"Thank\r\nGod that Thought is Free.\" Miss Anthony was presented by Miss H.\r\nAugusta Howard and, after a speech complimentary to Southern women,\r\nintroduced Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake (N. Y.), who eulogized Southern\r\nChivalry, and Mrs. Lida A. Meriwether (Tenn.), who spoke in behalf of\r\nMotherhood. Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates (Me.) made the closing address,\r\nin which she said: \"As surely as I want to vote--and nothing is more\r\ncertain--the man for whom I have most wished to vote was your own\r\nbeloved Henry W. Grady. There is something else for women to do than\r\nto sit at home and fan themselves, 'cherishing their femininity.'\r\nWomanliness will never be sacrificed in following the path of duty and\r\nservice.\"\r\n\r\nOne of the principal addresses of the convention was that of Gen.\r\nRobert R. Hemphill of South Carolina, who began by saying that in 1892\r\nhe introduced a woman suffrage resolution in his State Senate, which\r\nreceived fourteen out of thirty-five votes. He closed as follows: \"The\r\ncause is making headway, though slowly it is true, for it has the\r\nprejudices of hundreds of years to contend against. The peaceful\r\nrevolution is upon us. It will not turn backward but will go on\r\nconquering until its final triumph. Woman will be exalted, she will\r\nenjoy equal rights; pure politics and good government will be\r\ninsured, the cause of morality advanced, and the happiness of the\r\npeople established.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Alice Stone Blackwell (Mass.) discussed The Strongholds of\r\nOpposition, showing what they are and how they must be attacked. Woman\r\nas a Subject was presented by Mrs. Caroline E. Merrick (La.), who said\r\nin part:\r\n\r\n     Women are, and ever will be, loyal, tender, true and devoted to\r\n     their well beloved men; for they naturally love them better than\r\n     they do themselves. It is the brave soldier submissive to\r\n     authority who deserves promotion to rank and honor; so woman,\r\n     having proved herself a good subject, is now ready for her\r\n     promotion and advancement. She is urgently asking, not to rule\r\n     over men, but to take command of herself and all her rightful\r\n     belongings....\r\n\r\n     As a self-respecting, reasonable being, she has grave\r\n     responsibilities, and from her is required an accountability\r\n     strict and severe. If she owns stock in one of your banks, she\r\n     has an influence in the management of the institution which takes\r\n     care of her money. The possession of children makes her a large\r\n     stockholder in public morality, but her self-constituted agents\r\n     act as her proxy without her authorization, as though she were of\r\n     unsound mind, or not in existence.\r\n\r\n     The great truths of liberty and equality are dear to her heart.\r\n     She would die before she would imperil the well-being of her\r\n     home. She has no design to subvert church government, nor is she\r\n     organized to tear up the social fabric of polite society. But she\r\n     has now come squarely up to a crisis, a new epoch in her history\r\n     here in the South, and asks for a womanly right to participate by\r\n     vote in this representative government.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, you value the power and privilege which the right of\r\n     suffrage has conferred upon you, and in your honest, manly souls\r\n     you can not but disdain the meanness and injustice which might\r\n     prompt you to deny it to women. Language utterly fails me when I\r\n     try to describe the painful humiliation and mortification which\r\n     attend this abject condition of total disfranchisement, and how\r\n     anxiously and earnestly women desire to be taken out of the list\r\n     of idiots, criminals and imbeciles, where they do not belong, and\r\n     placed in the respectable company of men who choose their\r\n     lawmakers, and give an intelligent consent to the legal power\r\n     which controls them.\r\n\r\n     Do women deserve nothing? Are they not worthy? They have a noble\r\n     cause, and they beg you to treat it magnanimously.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Lyle Saxon (La.) described in an interesting manner\r\nClub Life among the Women of the South. Mrs. Blake gave a powerful\r\naddress on Wife, Mother and Citizen. Miss Shaw closed the meeting with\r\nan impromptu speech in which, according to the reporter, she said: \"It\r\nis declared that women are too emotional to vote; but the morning\r\npaper described a pugilistic encounter between two members of Congress\r\nwhich looked as if excitability were not limited to women. It is said\r\nthat 'the legal male mind' is the only mind fit for suffrage.\" Miss\r\nShaw then made her wit play around the legal male mind like chain\r\nlightning. \"It is said that women are illogical, and jump to their\r\nconclusions, flea-like. I shall not try to prove that women are\r\nlogical, for I know they are not, but it is beyond me how men ever got\r\nit into their heads that _they_ are. When we read the arguments\r\nagainst woman suffrage, we see that flea-like jumping is by no means\r\nconfined to women.\"\r\n\r\nOn one evening the Hon. Henry C. Hammond of Georgia made the opening\r\naddress, which was thus reported:\r\n\r\n     After declaring that the atmosphere of the nineteenth century is\r\n     surcharged with the sentiment of woman's emancipation, he traced\r\n     the gradual evolution of this sentiment, showing that one by one\r\n     the shackles had been stricken from the limbs of woman until now\r\n     she was making her final protest against tyranny and her last\r\n     appeal for liberty. \"What is meant,\" said he, \"by this mysterious\r\n     dictum, 'Out of her sphere?' It is merely a sentimental phrase\r\n     without either sense or reason.\" He then proceeded to say that if\r\n     woman had a sphere the privilege of voting was clearly within its\r\n     limitations. There was no doubt in his mind as to woman's moral\r\n     superiority, and the politics of the country was in need of her\r\n     purifying touch. In its present distracted and unhappy condition,\r\n     the adoption of the woman suffrage platform and the incorporation\r\n     of equal rights into the supreme law of the land was the only\r\n     hope of its ultimate salvation....\r\n\r\nJ. Colton Lynes of Georgia, taking for his subject Women to the Front,\r\ngave a valuable historical review of their progress during the last\r\nhalf century. Mrs. Josephine K. Henry was introduced as \"the daughter\r\nof Kentucky,\" and the _Constitution_ said the next day: \"If the spirit\r\nof old Patrick Henry could have heard the eloquent plea of his\r\nnamesake, he would have had no reason to blush for a decadence of the\r\noratory which gave the name to the world.\" In considering Woman\r\nSuffrage in the South, Mrs. Henry said:\r\n\r\n     It is asserted on all sides that the women of the South do not\r\n     want the ballot. The real truth is the women of the South never\r\n     have been asked what they want. When Pundita Ramabai was in this\r\n     country she saw a hen carried to market with its head downward.\r\n     This Christian method of treating a poor, dumb creature caused\r\n     the heathen woman to cry out, \"Oh, how cruel to carry a hen with\r\n     its head down!\" and she quickly received the reply, \"Why, the hen\r\n     does not mind it\"; and in her heathen innocence she inquired,\r\n     \"Did you ask the hen?\" Past civilization has not troubled either\r\n     dumb creatures or women by consulting them in regard to their own\r\n     affairs. For woman everything in sociology, law or politics has\r\n     been arranged without consulting her in any way, and when her\r\n     rights are trampled on and money extorted from her by the votes\r\n     of the vicious and ignorant, the glib tongue of tyranny says,\r\n     \"Tax her again, she has no wish or right to tell what she wants.\"\r\n     ...\r\n\r\n     Where the laws rob her in marriage of her property, she does want\r\n     possession and control of her inheritance and earnings. Where she\r\n     is a mother, she wants co-guardianship of her own children. Where\r\n     she is a breadwinner she wants equal pay for equal work. She\r\n     wants to wipe out the law that in its savagery protects brutality\r\n     when it preys upon innocent, defenseless girlhood. She wants the\r\n     streets and highways of the land made safe for the child whose\r\n     life cost her a hand to hand conflict with death. She wants a\r\n     single standard of morals established, where a woman may have an\r\n     equal chance with a man in this hard, old world, and it may not\r\n     be possible to crowd a fallen woman out of society and close\r\n     against her every avenue whereby she can make an honest living,\r\n     while the fallen man runs for Congress and is heaped with honors.\r\n     More than all, she needs and wants the ballot, the only weapon\r\n     for the protection of individual rights recognized in this\r\n     government.\r\n\r\n     In short, this New Woman of the New South wants to be a citizen\r\n     queen as well as a queen of hearts and a queen of home, whose\r\n     throne under the present regime rests on the sandy foundation of\r\n     human generosity and human caprice. It should be remembered that\r\n     the women of the South are the daughters of their fathers, and\r\n     have as invincible a spirit in their convictions in the cause of\r\n     liberty and justice as had those fathers.\r\n\r\n     We come asking the men of our section for the right of suffrage,\r\n     not that it be bestowed on us as a gift on a suppliant, but that\r\n     our birthright, bequeathed to us by the immortal Jefferson, be\r\n     restored to us....\r\n\r\n     The most pathetic picture in all history is this great conflict\r\n     which women are waging for their liberty. Men armed with all the\r\n     death-dealing weapons devised by human ingenuity, and with the\r\n     wealth of nations at their backs, have waged wars of\r\n     extermination to gain freedom; but women with no weapon save\r\n     argument, and no wealth save the justice of their cause, are\r\n     carrying on a war of education for their liberty, and no earthly\r\n     power can keep them from winning the victory.\r\n\r\nThe Next Phase of the Woman Question was considered by Miss Mary C.\r\nFrancis (O.) from the standpoint of a practical newspaper woman. Mrs.\r\nChapman Catt, chairman of the national organization committee, made\r\nthe last address, taking for a subject Eternal Justice. The\r\n_Constitution_ said: \"As a rapid, logical and fluent speaker it is\r\ndoubtful if America ever has produced one more gifted, and the\r\nsuffrage movement is fortunate in having so brilliant a woman for its\r\nchampion.\"\r\n\r\nHenry B. Blackwell urged the South to adopt woman suffrage as one\r\nsolution of the negro problem:\r\n\r\n     Apply it to your own State of Georgia, where there are 149,895\r\n     white women who can read and write, and 143,471 negro voters, of\r\n     whom 116,516 are illiterates.\r\n\r\n     The time has come when this question should be considered. An\r\n     educational qualification for suffrage may or may not be wise,\r\n     but it is not necessarily unjust. If each voter governed only\r\n     himself, his intelligence would concern himself alone, but his\r\n     vote helps to govern everybody else. Society in conceding his\r\n     right has itself a right to require from him a suitable\r\n     preparation. Ability to read and write is absolutely necessary as\r\n     a means of obtaining accurate political information. Without it\r\n     the voter is almost sure to become the tool of political\r\n     demagogues. With free schools provided by the States, every\r\n     citizen can qualify himself without money and without price.\r\n     Under such circumstances there is no infringement of rights in\r\n     requiring an educational qualification as a pre-requisite of\r\n     voting. Indeed, without this, suffrage is often little more than\r\n     a name. \"Suffrage is the authoritative exercise of rational\r\n     choice in regard to principles, measures and men.\" The comparison\r\n     of an unintelligent voter to a \"trained monkey,\" who goes through\r\n     the motion of dropping a paper ballot into a box, has in it an\r\n     element of truth. Society, therefore, has a right to prescribe,\r\n     in the admission of any new class of voters, such a qualification\r\n     as every one can attain and as will enable the voter to cast an\r\n     intelligent and responsible vote.\r\n\r\n     In the development of our complex political society we have\r\n     to-day two great bodies of illiterate citizens: In the North,\r\n     people of foreign birth; in the South, people of the African race\r\n     and a considerable portion of the native white population.\r\n     Against foreigners and negroes, as such, we would not\r\n     discriminate. But in every State, save one, there are more\r\n     educated women than all the illiterate voters, white and black,\r\n     native and foreign.\r\n\r\nThe convention proper closed on Saturday night, but the exercises\r\nSunday afternoon may be said to have been a continuation of it. The\r\nofficial report said:\r\n\r\n     The services began at 3 o'clock and more than half an hour before\r\n     this time the theatre was filled almost to its fullest capacity.\r\n     When the opening hour arrived there was not an empty chair in the\r\n     house, every aisle was crowded, and people anxious to hear the\r\n     sermon of the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw had invaded the stage. So\r\n     dense became the crowd that the doors were ordered closed and\r\n     people were refused admission even before the services began.\r\n     After the doors were closed the disappointed ones stood on the\r\n     stairs and many of them remained in the streets. The vast\r\n     congregation was made up of all classes of citizens. Every chair\r\n     that could be found in the theatre had been either placed in the\r\n     aisles or on the stage, and then boxes and benches were pressed\r\n     into service. Many of the most prominent professional and\r\n     business men were standing on the stage and in different parts of\r\n     the house.\r\n\r\nMiss Shaw gave her great sermon The Heavenly Vision. She told of the\r\nvisions of the man which it depended upon himself to make reality; of\r\nthe visions of the woman which were forever placed beyond her reach by\r\nthe church, by society and by the laws, and closed with these words:\r\n\"We ask for nothing which God can not give us. God created nature, and\r\nif our demands are contrary to nature, trust nature to take care of\r\nitself without the aid of man. It is better to be true to what you\r\nbelieve, though that be wrong, than to be false to what you believe,\r\neven if that belief is correct.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Clara Bewick Colby (D. C.) preached to more than a thousand\r\npeople at the Bethel (colored) Church; Mrs. Meriwether at the\r\nUnitarian Church; Miss Yates and Miss Emily Howland (N. Y.) also\r\noccupied pulpits.\r\n\r\nThe evening programs with their formal addresses naturally attracted\r\nthe largest audiences and occupied the most space in the newspapers,\r\nbut the morning and afternoon sessions, devoted to State and committee\r\nreports and the business of the association, were really the life and\r\nsoul of this as of all the conventions. Among the most interesting of\r\nthe excellent State reports presented to the Atlanta meeting were\r\nthose of New York and Kansas, because during the previous year\r\nsuffrage campaigns had been carried on in those States. The former,\r\npresented by Mrs. Jean Brooks Greenleaf, State president, said in\r\npart:\r\n\r\n     The New York Constitutional Convention before whom we hopefully\r\n     carried our cause--\"so old, so new, so ever true\"--is a thing of\r\n     the past. We presented our petition, asking that the word \"male\"\r\n     be eliminated from the organic law, with the endorsement of _over\r\n     half a million_ citizens of the State. We laid before the\r\n     convention statistics showing that outside the city of New York\r\n     the property on which women pay taxes is assessed at\r\n     $348,177,107; the number of women taxed, 146,806 in 571 cities\r\n     and towns; not reported, 389.\r\n\r\n     We had the satisfaction of knowing that the delegates assembled\r\n     were kept upon a strong equal suffrage diet for days and nights\r\n     together. At the public hearings, graciously granted us, we saw\r\n     the great jury listen not only with patience but with evident\r\n     pleasure and enthusiasm, while women representing twenty-six\r\n     districts gave reasons for wanting to be enfranchised; and we\r\n     also saw the creative body itself turned into a woman suffrage\r\n     meeting for three evenings. At the close of the last we learned\r\n     that there were in this convention ninety-eight men who dared to\r\n     say that the freemen of the State should not be allowed to decide\r\n     whether their wives, mothers and daughters should be enfranchised\r\n     or not. We learned also, that there were fifty-eight men,\r\n     constituting a noble minority, who loved justice better than\r\n     party power, and were willing to risk the latter to sustain the\r\n     former.[102]\r\n\r\nThe report of the Press Committee Chairman, Mrs. Ellen Battelle\r\nDietrick (Mass.), called especial attention to the flood of matter\r\nrelating to the woman question which was now appearing in the\r\nnewspapers and magazines of the country, to the activity of the enemy\r\nand to the necessity for suffragists to \"publish an antidote wherever\r\nthe poison appears.\" The Legislative Committee, Mrs. Blake, Mrs. Henry\r\nand Mrs. Diggs, closed their report as follows:\r\n\r\n     In a State where there is hope of support from the political\r\n     parties, where there has been long agitation and everything\r\n     points to a favorable result, it is wise to urge a constitutional\r\n     amendment striking out the word \"male\" as a qualification for\r\n     voters. This must pass both Houses in the form of concurrent\r\n     resolution; in some States it must pass two successive\r\n     Legislatures; and it must be ratified at the polls by a majority\r\n     of the voters.\r\n\r\n     When the conditions are not yet ripe for a constitutional\r\n     amendment, there are many measures which are valuable in arousing\r\n     public interest and preparing the way for final triumph, as well\r\n     as important in ameliorating the condition of women. Among these\r\n     are laws to secure school suffrage for women; women on boards of\r\n     education and as school trustees; equality of property rights for\r\n     husbands and wives; equal guardianship of children for mother and\r\n     father; women factory inspectors; women physicians in hospitals\r\n     and insane asylums; women trustees in all State institutions;\r\n     police matrons; seats for saleswomen; the raising of \"the age of\r\n     consent.\"\r\n\r\nThe report of the Plan of Work Committee, Mrs. Chapman Catt, chairman,\r\nbegan by saying:\r\n\r\n     The great need of the hour is organization. There can be no\r\n     doubt that the advocates of woman suffrage in the United States\r\n     are to be numbered by millions, but it is a lamentable fact that\r\n     our organization can count its numbers only by thousands. There\r\n     are illustrious men and women in every State, and there are men\r\n     and women innumerable, who are not known to the public, who are\r\n     openly and avowedly woman suffragists, yet we do not possess the\r\n     benefit of their names on our membership lists or the financial\r\n     help of their dues. In other words, the size of our membership is\r\n     not at all commensurate with the sentiment for woman suffrage.\r\n     The reason for this condition is plain; the chief work of\r\n     suffragists for the past forty years has been education and\r\n     agitation, and not organization. The time has come when the\r\n     educational work has borne its fruit, and there are States in\r\n     which there is sentiment enough to carry a woman suffrage\r\n     amendment, but it is individual and not organized sentiment, and\r\n     is, therefore, ineffective.\r\n\r\nThe audience was greatly amused when Miss Anthony commented on this:\r\n\"There never yet was a young woman who did not feel that if she had\r\nhad the management of the work from the beginning the cause would have\r\nbeen carried long ago. I felt just so when I was young.\" There was\r\nmuch laughter also over one of Mrs. Abigail Scott Duniway's short\r\nspeeches in which she said:\r\n\r\n     There are in Oregon three classes of women opposed to suffrage.\r\n     1. Women who are so overworked that they have no time to think of\r\n     it. They are joined to their wash-tubs; let them alone. But the\r\n     children of these overworked women are coming on. 2. Women who\r\n     have usurped all the rights in the matrimonial category, their\r\n     husbands' as well as their own. The husbands of such women are\r\n     always loudly opposed to suffrage. The \"sassiest\" man in any\r\n     community is the hen-pecked husband away from home. 3. Young\r\n     girls matrimonially inclined, who fear the avowal of a belief in\r\n     suffrage would injure their chances. I can assure such girls that\r\n     a woman who wishes to vote gets more offers than one who does\r\n     not. Their motto should be \"Liberty first, and union afterwards.\"\r\n     The man whose wife is a clinging vine is apt to be like the oaks\r\n     in the forest that are found wrapped in vines--dead at the top.\r\n\r\nWhen Miss Anthony said, \"One reason why politicians hesitate to grant\r\nsuffrage to woman is because she is an unknown quantity,\" Mrs. Henry\r\nresponded quickly, \"There are two great unknown forces to-day,\r\nelectricity and woman, but men can reckon much better on electricity\r\nthan they can on woman.\" A resolution was adopted for a public\r\ncelebration in New York City of Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton's\r\neightieth birthday, November 12, by the association.[103]\r\n\r\nThe treasurer, Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, reported the receipts of the\r\npast year to be $5,820, of which $2,571 went to the Kansas campaign.\r\nThe contributions and pledges of this convention for the coming year\r\nwere about $2,000. In addition, Mrs. Louisa Southworth of Cleveland\r\ngave $1,000 to Miss Anthony to use as she thought best, and she\r\nannounced that it would be applied to opening national headquarters. A\r\nNational Organization Committee was for the first time formally\r\norganized and Mrs. Chapman Catt was made its chairman by unanimous\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nMrs. Colby presented the memorial resolutions, saying in part:\r\n\r\n     During the past year our association has lost by death a number\r\n     of members whose devotion to the cause of woman's liberty has\r\n     contributed largely to the position she holds to-day, and whose\r\n     labors are a part of the history of this great struggle for the\r\n     amelioration of her condition. Among these beloved friends and\r\n     co-workers three stood, each as the foremost representative in a\r\n     distinct line of action: Myra Bradwell of Chicago, Virginia L.\r\n     Minor of St. Louis, Amelia Bloomer of Council Bluffs, Ia.\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Bradwell was the first to make a test case with regard to\r\n     the civil rights of women, and to prove that the disfranchised\r\n     citizen is unprotected. [Her struggle to secure from the U.S.\r\n     Supreme Court a decision enabling women to practice law was\r\n     related.] The special importance of Mrs. Minor's connection with\r\n     the suffrage work lies in the fact that she first formulated and\r\n     enunciated the idea that women have the right to vote under the\r\n     United States Constitution. [The story was then told of Mrs.\r\n     Minor's case in the U.S. Supreme Court to test the right of women\r\n     to vote under the Fourteenth Amendment.][104] Mrs. Amelia Bloomer\r\n     was the first woman to own and edit a paper devoted to woman\r\n     suffrage and temperance, the _Lily_, published in Seneca Falls,\r\n     N. Y. She was also an eloquent lecturer for both these reforms\r\n     and one of the first women to hold an office under the\r\n     Government, as deputy postmaster. The costume which bears her\r\n     name she did not originate, but wore and advocated for a number\r\n     of years.\r\n\r\n     Of the noble band that started in 1848, few now remain, but a\r\n     host of young women are already on the stage of action, even\r\n     better equipped than were our pioneers to plead their own cases\r\n     in the courts, the halls of legislation, the pulpit and the\r\n     press.\r\n\r\nTwo large receptions were given to the delegates and visitors, one at\r\nthe Hotel Aragon, and one by Mrs. W. A. Hemphill, chairman of the\r\nCommittee on the Professional Work of Women at the approaching Cotton\r\nStates Exposition soon to be held in Atlanta. She was assisted by Mrs.\r\nW. Y. Atkinson, wife of the newly-elected Governor of Georgia.\r\n\r\nDuring several weeks before the convention Miss Anthony and Mrs.\r\nChapman Catt had made a tour of the Southern States, speaking in the\r\nprincipal cities to arouse suffrage sentiment, as this section was\r\npractically an unvisited field. Immediately after the convention\r\nclosed a mass meeting was held in the court-house of Atlanta.\r\nAfterwards Mrs. Blake was requested to address the Legislature of\r\nNorth Carolina, Miss Anthony lectured in a number of cities on the way\r\nnorthward, and others were invited to hold meetings in the neighboring\r\nStates. Most of the speakers and delegates met in Washington on\r\nFebruary 15 to celebrate Miss Anthony's seventy-fifth birthday and\r\nparticipate in the triennial convention of the National Council of\r\nWomen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[101] The three sisters, Claudia Howard Maxwell, Miriam Howard Du Bose\r\nand H. Augusta Howard, who as delegates at Washington the previous\r\nwinter had invited the association to Atlanta, bore the principal part\r\nof these expenses and were largely responsible for the success of the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\n[102] The facts and figures presented in the report from Kansas by the\r\npresident, Mrs. Laura M. Johns, will be found in the chapter on that\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[103] For an account of this beautiful celebration in the Metropolitan\r\nOpera House with an audience of 3,000, see Life and Work of Susan B.\r\nAnthony, p. 848; also Reminiscences of Elizabeth Cady Stanton.\r\n\r\n[104] For account of Mrs. Bradwell's case see History of Woman\r\nSuffrage, Vol. II, p. 601; of Mrs. Minor's, same, p. 715.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVI.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL-AMERICAN CONVENTION OF 1896.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe suffrage association held its Twenty-eighth annual convention in\r\nthe Church of Our Father, Washington, D. C., Jan. 23-28, 1896. In her\r\nopening remarks the president, Miss Susan B. Anthony, said:\r\n\r\n     The thought that brought us here twenty-eight years ago was that,\r\n     if the Federal Constitution could be invoked to protect black men\r\n     in the right to vote, the same great authority could be invoked\r\n     to protect women. The question has been urged upon every Congress\r\n     since 1869. We asked at first for a Sixteenth Amendment\r\n     enfranchising women; then for suffrage under the Fourteenth\r\n     Amendment; then, when the Supreme Court had decided that against\r\n     us, we returned to the Sixteenth Amendment and have pressed it\r\n     ever since. The same thing has been done in this Fifty-fourth\r\n     Congress which has been done in every Congress for a decade,\r\n     namely, the introducing of a bill providing for the new\r\n     amendment....\r\n\r\n     You will notice that the seats of the delegation from Utah are\r\n     marked by a large United States flag bearing three stars, a big\r\n     one and two smaller ones. The big star is for Wyoming, because it\r\n     stood alone for a quarter of a century as the only place where\r\n     _women had full suffrage_. Colorado comes next, because it is the\r\n     first State where a majority of the men voted to grant women\r\n     equal rights. Then comes Utah, because its men in convention\r\n     assembled--in spite of the bad example of Congress, which took\r\n     the right away from its women nine years ago--those men, having\r\n     seen the good effects of woman suffrage for years, voted by an\r\n     overwhelming majority to leave out the little word \"male\" from\r\n     the suffrage clause of their new State Constitution, and their\r\n     action was ratified by the electors. Next year, if I am here, I\r\n     hope to rejoice with you over woman suffrage in California and\r\n     Idaho.\r\n\r\nSome one whispered to Miss Anthony that the convention had not been\r\nopened with prayer, and she answered without the slightest confusion:\r\n\"Now, friends, you all know I am a Quaker. We give thanks in silence.\r\nI do not think the heart of any one here has been fuller of silent\r\nthankfulness than mine, but I should not have remembered to have the\r\nmeeting formally opened with prayer if somebody had not reminded me.\r\nThe Rev. Anna Howard Shaw will offer prayer.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Shaw's report as vice-president-at-large was full of the little\r\ntouches of humor for which she was noted:\r\n\r\n     The report of my specific work would not take long; but the work\r\n     that really did count for our association began last May, when\r\n     your president and I were invited to California. On the way we\r\n     stopped first at St. Louis, where Miss Anthony spoke before the\r\n     Women's Federation, the Woman's Council, and the State W. S. A.\r\n     From there we went to Denver, where we had a remarkable meeting,\r\n     and a warm greeting was given to Miss Anthony by the newly\r\n     enfranchised women of Colorado. It was pleasant to find them so\r\n     grateful to the pioneers. The large opera house was packed, and a\r\n     reception, in which the newspapers estimated that 1,500 persons\r\n     took part, was afterwards given at the Palace Hotel.\r\n\r\n     From Denver we went to Cheyenne, where we addressed the citizens,\r\n     men and women. For once there were present at our meeting quite\r\n     as many men as women, and not only ordinary but extraordinary\r\n     men. After introducing us to the audience, Mrs. Theresa A.\r\n     Jenkins introduced the audience to us. It included the Governor,\r\n     Senators, Representatives, Judges of the Supreme Court, city\r\n     officials, and never so many majors and colonels, and it showed\r\n     that where women have a vote, men think their meetings are worth\r\n     going to. We were the guests of the Governor during our stay in\r\n     Colorado, and guests of a U. S. Senator in Wyoming. At Salt Lake\r\n     all the city turned out, and I spoke in the Tabernacle to the\r\n     largest audience I ever had. It was sympathetic too, for Utah\r\n     people are accustomed to go to church and listen. At Ogden they\r\n     had to take two buildings for the meeting. At Reno, Nevada, there\r\n     was a large audience.\r\n\r\n     The Woman's Congress at San Francisco was the most marvelous\r\n     gathering I ever saw. The newspapers said the men were all\r\n     hypnotized, or they would not stand on the sidewalk two hours to\r\n     get into a church. Every subject considered during the whole\r\n     week, whether it was the care of children or the decoration of\r\n     the home, turned on the ballot for women, and Susan B. Anthony\r\n     was the belle of the ball. The superintendent of San Francisco\r\n     closed the schools that Miss Anthony might address the 900\r\n     teachers. The Ministers' Association passed resolutions favoring\r\n     the amendment. We went the whole length of the State and the\r\n     meetings were just as enthusiastic.\r\n\r\n     The Citizens' Committee asked women to take part in the Fourth of\r\n     July celebration. The women accepted more than the men meant they\r\n     should, for they insisted that a woman should be on the program.\r\n     The Program Committee refused, and the Executive Committee said\r\n     if they did not put a woman on they should be discharged. Instead\r\n     of this they proposed that Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper should provide\r\n     sandwiches for over 5,000 kindergarten children. That was the\r\n     kind of work they invited such women to do.\r\n\r\n     The Program Committee discussed the matter, and their discussion\r\n     could be heard four blocks away, but they finally yielded and\r\n     invited me to speak. So Miss Anthony and I rode for three miles\r\n     in a highly-decorated carriage, just behind the mayor and\r\n     followed by a brass band and the fire brigade, and I wore a big\r\n     badge that almost covered me, just like the badge worn by the\r\n     masculine orator. The dispute between the Executive and the\r\n     Program Committees had excited so much interest that there were\r\n     more cheers for your president and vice-president as we passed\r\n     along than there were for the mayor....\r\n\r\n     They wanted us both to come back in the fall. I went and spoke\r\n     thirty-four times in thirty-seven evenings.\r\n\r\nAs the vice-president finished, Miss Anthony observed in her\r\ncharacteristic manner: \"Miss Shaw said she only went to California to\r\nhold Miss Anthony's bonnet, but, when we left, everybody thought that\r\nI had come to hold her bonnet. It is my delight to see these girls\r\ndevelop and outdo their elders. There is another little woman that I\r\nwant to come up here to the platform, Mrs. Chapman Catt. While she is\r\nblushing and getting ready, there is a delegation here from the\r\nWoman's National Press Association.\" Mesdames Lockwood, Gates,\r\nCromwell and Emerson were introduced, and Miss Anthony remarked: \"Our\r\nmovement depends greatly on the press. The worst mistake any woman can\r\nmake is to get crosswise with the newspapers.\"[105]\r\n\r\nBy this time Mrs. Chapman Catt had reached the platform, and Miss\r\nAnthony continued: \"Mrs. Catt went down South with me last year to\r\nhold my bonnet; and wherever we were, at Memphis or New Orleans or\r\nelsewhere, when she had spoken, Miss Anthony was nowhere. It is she\r\nwho has done the splendid organization work which has brought into the\r\nassociation nearly every State in the Union, and every Territory\r\nexcept the Indian and Alaska and we shall have them next year.\"\r\n\r\nAn able address was given by Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby (D. C.) on The\r\nPhilosophy of Woman Suffrage, in which she said:\r\n\r\n     Woman suffrage is in harmony with the evolution of the race. The\r\n     progress of civilization has developed the finer forces of\r\n     mankind and made ready for the entrance of woman into government.\r\n     As long as man was merely a slayer of men and animals he did not\r\n     feel the need of the co-partnership of woman, but as his\r\n     fatherhood was developed he felt his inadequacy and the necessity\r\n     of the maternal element by his side. Woman suffrage is in harmony\r\n     with the growth of the idea of the worth of the individual, which\r\n     has its best expression in our republic. Our nation is heir of\r\n     all the struggles for freedom which have been made....\r\n\r\n     The Magna Charta belongs to us as much as does the Declaration of\r\n     Independence. In all these achievements for liberty women have\r\n     borne their share. Not only have they inspired men but the record\r\n     of the past is illumined with the story of their own brave deeds.\r\n     Women love liberty as well as men do. The love of liberty is the\r\n     corollary of the right of consent to government. All the progress\r\n     of our nation has been along the line of extending the\r\n     application of this basic idea....\r\n\r\n     Woman suffrage is in harmony with the evolution in the status of\r\n     women. They always have done their share in the development of\r\n     the race. There always has been a \"new woman,\" some one stepping\r\n     out in advance of the rest and gaining a place for others to\r\n     stand upon.... We have no cause to blush for our ancestors. We\r\n     may save our blushes for the women of to-day who do not live up\r\n     to their privileges.\r\n\r\n     Now that woman has made such advance in personal and property\r\n     rights, educational and industrial opportunities, to deny her the\r\n     ballot is to force her to occupy a much more degrading position\r\n     than did the women of the past. We think the savage woman\r\n     degraded because she walks behind her husband bearing the burden\r\n     to leave his hands free for the weapon which is his sign of\r\n     sovereignty; what shall we say of the woman of to-day who may not\r\n     follow her husband and brother as he goes forth to wield the\r\n     weapon of civilization, the ballot? If the evolution in the\r\n     status of woman does not point to the franchise it is\r\n     meaningless.\r\n\r\nMrs. Colby was followed by Miss Julie R. Jenney, a member of the bar\r\nin Syracuse, N. Y., with a thoughtful address on Law and the Ballot.\r\nShe showed that woman's present legal rights are in the nature of a\r\nlicense, and therefore revocable at the will of the bodies granting\r\nthem, and that until women elect the lawmakers they can not be\r\nentirely sure of any rights whatever. Between Daybreak and Sunrise was\r\nthe title of the address of Mrs. May Stocking Knaggs (Mich.), who\r\npleaded for the opportunity of complete co-operation between men and\r\nwomen, declaring that \"each human being is a whole, single and\r\nresponsible; each human unit is concerned in the social compact which\r\nis formed to protect individual and mutual rights.\"\r\n\r\nThis was the first appearance of Mrs. Stetson on this national\r\nplatform. She came as representative of the Pacific Coast Woman's\r\nCongress and California Suffrage Association. The _Woman's Journal_\r\nsaid: \"Those of us who have for years admired Mrs. Stetson's\r\nremarkably bright poems were delighted to meet her, and to find her\r\neven more interesting than her writings. She is still a young woman,\r\ntall, lithe and graceful, with fine dark eyes, and spirit and\r\noriginality flashing from her at every turn like light from a diamond.\r\nShe read several poems to the convention, made an address one evening\r\nand preached twice on Sunday; and the delegates followed her around,\r\nas iron filings follow a magnet.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Catharine E. Hirst, president of the Ladies of the G. A. R.; Mrs.\r\nLillian M. Hollister, representing the Supreme Hive Ladies of the\r\nMaccabees; Miss Harriette A. Keyser, from the Political Study Club of\r\nNew York; Mrs. Rose E. Lumpkin, president Virginia King's Daughters,\r\nwere presented as fraternal delegates. Grace Greenwood and Mrs.\r\nCaroline B. Buell were introduced to the convention.\r\n\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt spoke for the Course of Study in Political Science,\r\nwhich had been in operation only five months, had sold five hundred\r\nfull sets of books and reported over one hundred clubs formed. The\r\ncommittee on credentials reported 138 delegates present, and all the\r\nStates and Territories represented except thirteen. A very\r\nsatisfactory report of the first year's work of the organization\r\ncommittee was presented by its chairman, Mrs. Chapman Catt, which\r\nclosed as follows:\r\n\r\n     Our committee are more than ever convinced that it is possible to\r\n     build a great organization based upon the one platform of the\r\n     enfranchisement of women. With harmony, co-operation and\r\n     determination we shall yet build this organization, of such\r\n     numbers and political strength that through the power of\r\n     constituency it can dictate at least one plank in the platform of\r\n     every political party, and secure an amendment from any\r\n     Legislature it petitions. We believe it will yet have its\r\n     auxiliaries in every village and hamlet, township and school\r\n     district, to influence majorities when the amendment is\r\n     submitted. More--we believe ere many years its powers will be so\r\n     subtle and widespread that it can besiege the conservatism of\r\n     Congress itself, and come away with the laurel wreath of victory.\r\n\r\nNearly $3,300 were at once pledged for the committee, Miss Anthony\r\nherself agreeing to raise $600 of this amount.\r\n\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt presented also a detailed Plan of Work, which\r\nincluded Organization, Club Work, Letter Writing, Raising of Money\r\nand Political Work. Of the last she said: \"The time has fully come\r\nwhen we should carry the rub-a-dub of our agitation into 'the\r\npolitical Africa,' that is into every town meeting of every township\r\nof every county, and every caucus or primary meeting of every ward of\r\nevery city of every State.... For a whole half century we have held\r\nspecial suffrage meetings, with audiences largely of women; that is,\r\nwomen have talked to women. We must now carry our discussion of the\r\nquestion into all of the different political party gatherings, for it\r\nis only there that the rank and file of the voters ever go. They won't\r\ncome to our meetings, so we must carry our gospel into theirs. It will\r\nbe of no more avail in the future than it has been in the past to send\r\nappeals to State and national conventions, so long as they are not\r\nbacked by petitions from a vast majority of the voting constituents of\r\ntheir members.\"\r\n\r\nWith the thousand dollars which had been put into Miss Anthony's hands\r\nby Mrs. Louisa Southworth of Cleveland the preceding year, national\r\nheadquarters had been opened in Philadelphia with Mrs. Rachel Foster\r\nAvery, corresponding secretary, in charge. Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton,\r\ntreasurer, reported total receipts for 1895 to be $9,835, with a\r\nbalance of several hundred dollars in the treasury.\r\n\r\nThe principal feature of the Saturday evening meeting was the address\r\nof Miss Elizabeth Burrill Curtis, daughter of George William Curtis,\r\non Universal Suffrage. She said in part:\r\n\r\n     I find many people in my native State of New York who are leaning\r\n     toward a limited suffrage, and therefore I am beginning to ask,\r\n     \"What does it mean? Is democratic government impossible after\r\n     all?\" For a government in order to be democratic must be founded\r\n     on the suffrages of all the people, not a part. A republic may\r\n     exist by virtue of a limited suffrage, but a democracy can not,\r\n     and a democratic government has been our theoretical ideal from\r\n     the first. Are we prepared, after a hundred and twenty years, to\r\n     own ourselves defeated?... Universal suffrage, to me, means the\r\n     right of every man and woman who is mentally able to do so, and\r\n     who has not forfeited the right by an ill use of it, to say who\r\n     shall rule them, and what action shall be taken by those rulers\r\n     upon questions of moment....\r\n\r\n     This brings me to what I wish to say about those who desire a\r\n     limited suffrage. Who are they, and to what class do they belong?\r\n     For the most part, as I know them, they are men of property, who\r\n     belong to the educated classes, who are refined and cultivated,\r\n     and who see the government about them falling into the hands of\r\n     the unintelligent and often illiterate classes who are voted at\r\n     the polls like sheep. Therefore these gentlemen weep aloud and\r\n     wail and say: \"If we had a limited suffrage, if we and our\r\n     friends had the management of affairs, how much better things\r\n     would be!\"\r\n\r\n     Do not misunderstand me here. I am far from decrying the benefits\r\n     of education. Nobody believes in its necessity more sincerely\r\n     than I do. In fact I hold that, other things being equal, the\r\n     educated man is immeasurably in advance of the uneducated one;\r\n     but the trouble is that other things are often very far from\r\n     being equal and it is utterly impossible for the average man,\r\n     educated or not, to be trusted to decide with entire justice\r\n     between himself and another person when their interests are\r\n     equally involved....\r\n\r\n     The intelligent voter in a democratic community can not abdicate\r\n     his responsibility without being punished. He is the natural\r\n     leader, and if he refuses to fulfil his duties the leadership\r\n     will inevitably fall into the hands of those who are unfitted for\r\n     the high and holy task--and who is to blame? It is the educated\r\n     men, the professional men, the men of wealth and culture, who are\r\n     themselves responsible when things go wrong; and the refusal to\r\n     acknowledge their responsibility will not release them from\r\n     it....\r\n\r\n     The principle of universal suffrage, like every other high ideal,\r\n     will not stand alone. It carries duties with it, duties which are\r\n     imperative and which to shirk is filching benefits without\r\n     rendering an equivalent. How dare a man plead his private ease or\r\n     comfort as an excuse for neglecting his public duties? How dare\r\n     the remonstrating women of Massachusetts declare that they fear\r\n     the loss of privileges, one of which is the immunity from\r\n     punishment for a misdemeanor committed in the husband's presence?\r\n     \"When I was a child, I spake as a child, I thought as a child, I\r\n     understood as a child; but when I became a man, I put away\r\n     childish things.\"\r\n\r\n     Throughout history all women and many men have been forced, so\r\n     far as government has been concerned, to speak, think and\r\n     understand as children. Now, for the first time, we are asking\r\n     that the people, as a whole body, shall rise to their full\r\n     stature and put away childish things.\r\n\r\nThe sermon on Sunday afternoon was given by Mrs. Stetson from the\r\ntopic which was to have been considered by the Rev. Anna Garlin\r\nSpencer, The Spiritual Significance of Democracy and Woman's Relation\r\nto It. She spoke without notes and illustrated the central thought\r\nthat love grows where people are brought together, and that they are\r\nbrought together more in a democracy than in any other mode of living.\r\n\"Women have advanced less rapidly than men because they have always\r\nbeen more isolated. They have been brought into relation with their\r\nown families only. It is men who have held the inter-human\r\nrelation.... Everything came out of the home; but because you began\r\nin a cradle is no reason why you should always stay there. Because\r\ncharity begins at home is no reason why it should stop there, and\r\nbecause woman's first place is at home is no reason why her last and\r\nonly place should be there. Civilization has been held back because so\r\nmany men have inherited the limitations of the female sex. You can not\r\nraise public-spirited men from private-spirited mothers, but only from\r\nmothers who have been citizens in spite of their disfranchisement. In\r\nholding back the mothers of the race, you are keeping back the race.\"\r\n\r\nAt the memorial services loving tributes were paid to the friends of\r\nwoman suffrage who had passed away during the year. Among these were\r\nex-Secretary of the Treasury Hugh McCulloch, ex-Governor Oliver Ames\r\n(Mass.), Dr. James C. Jackson of Dansville (N. Y.), Dr. Abram W.\r\nLozier of New York City, Thomas Davis, Sarah Wilbur of Rhode Island,\r\nMarian Skidmore of Lily Dale, N. Y., and Amelia E. H. Doyon of\r\nMadison, Wis., who left $1,000 to the National Association.\r\n\r\nHenry B. Blackwell spoke of Theodore D. Weld, the great abolitionist,\r\nleader of the movement to found Oberlin, the first co-educational\r\ncollege, and one of the earliest advocates of equal rights for women.\r\nHe told also of Frederick Douglass, whose last act was to bear his\r\ntestimony in favor of suffrage for women at the Woman's Council in\r\nWashington on the very day of his death. Mrs. Avery gave a tender\r\neulogy of Theodore Lovett Sewall of Indianapolis, his brilliancy as a\r\nconversationalist, his charm as a host, his loyalty as a friend, his\r\nbeautiful devotion to his wife, Mrs. May Wright Sewall, and his\r\nlifelong adherence to the cause of woman.\r\n\r\nThe loss of Mrs. Ellen Battelle Dietrick came with crushing force, as\r\nher services to the association were invaluable. To her most intimate\r\nfriend, the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, was assigned the duty of speaking a\r\nword in her memory, and in broken sentences she said: \"I never knew\r\nsuch earnest purpose and consecration or such a fund of knowledge in\r\nany one as Mrs. Dietrick possessed. She never stopped thinking because\r\nshe had reached the furthest point to which some one else had thought.\r\nShe was the best antagonist I ever saw; I never knew any one who could\r\ndiffer so intensely, and yet be so perfectly calm and good-tempered.\r\nWhat she was as a friend no one can tell. Her death is a great loss to\r\nour press work. Perhaps no one ever wrote so many articles in the same\r\nlength of time. This was especially the case last summer. It seemed as\r\nif she had a premonition that her life would soon end, for she sat at\r\nher desk writing hour after hour. I believe it shortened her life. She\r\nhad just finished a book--Women in the Early Christian Ministry--and\r\nshe left many other manuscripts. It would be a pity if the rich, ripe\r\nthought of this woman should not be preserved. Her funeral was like\r\nher life, without show or display. No one outside the family was\r\npresent except myself. No eulogy was uttered there; she would not have\r\nwanted it. Tennyson's last poem, Crossing the Bar, was recited by her\r\nbrother-in-law, the Rev. J. W. Hamilton.[106]\" Miss Shaw ended her\r\nremarks by reciting this poem.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony, who was to close the exercises, was too much affected to\r\nspeak and motioned that the audience was dismissed, but no one\r\nstirred. At length she said: \"There are very few human beings who have\r\nthe courage to utter to the fullest their honest convictions--Mrs.\r\nDietrick was one of these few. She would follow truth wherever it led,\r\nand she would follow no other leader. Like Lucretia Mott, she took\r\n'truth for authority, not authority for truth.' Miss Anthony spoke\r\nalso of the \"less-known women\": \"Adeline Thomson, a most remarkable\r\ncharacter, was a sister to J. Edgar Thomson, first president of the\r\nPennsylvania railroad. She lived to be eighty, and for years she stood\r\nthere in Philadelphia, a monument of the past. Her house was my home\r\nwhen in that city for thirty years. We have also lost in Julia Wilbur\r\nof the District a most useful woman, and one who was faithful to the\r\nend. This is the first convention for twenty-eight years at which she\r\nhas not been present with us. We should all try to live so as to make\r\npeople feel that there is a vacancy when we go; but, dear friends, do\r\nnot let there be a vacancy long. Our battle has just reached the place\r\nwhere it can win, and if we do our work in the spirit of those who\r\nhave gone before, it will soon be over.\"\r\n\r\nThere was special rejoicing at this convention over the admission of\r\nUtah as a State with full suffrage for women. Senator and Mrs. Frank\r\nJ. Cannon and Representative and Mrs. C. E. Allen of Utah were on the\r\nplatform. In her address of welcome Miss Shaw said:\r\n\r\n     Every star added to that blue field makes for the advantage of\r\n     every human being. We are just beginning to learn that we are all\r\n     children of one Father and members of one family; and when one\r\n     member suffers or is benefited, all the members suffer or\r\n     rejoice. So when Utah comes into the Union with every one free,\r\n     it is not only that State which is benefited, but we and all the\r\n     world. As the stars at night come out one by one, so will they\r\n     come out one by one on our flag, till the whole blue field is a\r\n     blaze of glory.\r\n\r\n     We expected it of the men of Utah. No man there could have stood\r\n     by the side of his mother and heard her tell of all that the\r\n     pioneers endured, and then have refused to grant her the same\r\n     right of liberty he wanted for himself, without being unworthy of\r\n     such a mother. They are the crown of our Union, those three\r\n     States on the crest of the Rockies, above all the others. In the\r\n     name of the National American Woman Suffrage Association, we\r\n     extend our welcome, our thanks and our congratulations to Utah,\r\n     as one of the three so dear to the heart of every woman who loves\r\n     liberty in these United States.\r\n\r\nSenator Cannon said in response: \" ... Only one serious question came\r\nbefore our constitutional convention, and that was whether the\r\nadoption of woman suffrage would hinder the admission of our Territory\r\nas a State.... But our women had furnished courage, patience and\r\nheroism to our men, and so we said: 'Utah shall take another\r\nforty-nine years of wandering in the wilderness as a Territory before\r\ncoming in as a State without her women.' My mother wandered there for\r\ntwelve years. Women trailed bleeding feet and lived on roots that\r\nthose of to-day might reap bounteous harvests. Utah gave women the\r\nsuffrage while still a Territory. Congress, in its not quite infinite\r\nwisdom, took it away after they had exercised it intelligently for\r\nseventeen years; but the first chance that the men of Utah had they\r\ngave it back.\"\r\n\r\nRepresentative Allen was called on by Miss Anthony to \"tell us how\r\nnice it seems to feel that your wife is as good as you are,\" and said\r\nin part: \"Perhaps you have read what the real estate agents say about\r\nUtah--how they praise her sun and soil, her mountains and streams, and\r\nher precious metals. They tell you that she is filled with the basis\r\nof all material prosperity, with gold, silver, lead and iron: but\r\ngreatness can not come from material resources alone--it must come\r\nfrom the people who till and delve. Utah is great because her people\r\nare great. When she has centuries behind her she will make a splendid\r\nshowing because she has started right. She has given to that part of\r\nthe people who instinctively know what is right, the power to\r\ninfluence the body politic.... This movement is destined to go on\r\nuntil it reaches every State in the Union.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Allen and Mrs. Sarah A. Boyer told of the heroic efforts the\r\nwomen had made for themselves; and Mrs. Emily S. Richards,\r\nvice-president of the Territorial suffrage association, described in a\r\ngraphic manner the systematic and persistent work of this\r\norganization. The tribute to its president, Mrs. Emmeline B. Wells,\r\nwhose influence had been paramount in securing the franchise for the\r\nwomen of Utah, was heartily applauded and a telegram of congratulation\r\nwas sent to her.[107]\r\n\r\nThe address of Mrs. Ella Knowles Haskell, Assistant Attorney-General\r\nof Montana, on The Environments of Woman as Related to her Progress,\r\nattracted much attention. She had been the Populist candidate for\r\nAttorney-General and made a strong canvass but went down to defeat\r\nwith the rest of her party. Soon afterward she married her competitor,\r\nwho appointed her his assistant. She reviewed the laws of past ages,\r\nshowing how impossible it was then for women to rise above the\r\nconditions imposed upon them, and pointed out the wonderful progress\r\nthey had made as soon as even partial freedom had been granted.\r\n\r\nMrs. Virginia D. Young (S. C.), taking as a subject The Sunflower\r\nBloom of Woman's Equality, gave an address which in its quaint speech,\r\ndialect stories and attractive provincialisms captivated the audience.\r\n\r\nThe convention received an invitation from Mrs. John R. McLean for\r\nMonday afternoon to meet Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant on her seventieth\r\nbirthday. The ladies were welcomed by their hostess and Mrs. Nellie\r\nGrant Sartoris, while Miss Anthony, who had attended the luncheon\r\nwhich preceded the reception, presented the ladies to Mrs. Grant.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel Foster Avery, corresponding secretary, devoted a portion\r\nof her report to an account of the visit made by the delegates of the\r\nassociation in response to an invitation from the Woman's Board of\r\nCongresses of the Atlanta Exposition, Oct. 17, 1895. The principal\r\naddress on that occasion was made by Mrs. Helen Gardiner.\r\n\r\nThis convention was long remembered on account of the vigorous contest\r\nover what was known as the Bible Resolution. Mrs. Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton recently had issued a commentary on the passages of Scripture\r\nreferring to women, which she called \"The Woman's Bible.\" Although\r\nthis was done in her individual capacity, yet some of the members\r\nclaimed that, as she was honorary president of the National\r\nAssociation, this body was held by the public as partly responsible\r\nfor it and it injured their work for suffrage. A resolution was\r\nbrought in by the committee declaring: \"This association is\r\nnon-sectarian, being composed of persons of all shades of religious\r\nopinion, and has no official connection with the so-called 'Woman's\r\nBible' or any theological publication.\"\r\n\r\nThe debate was long and animated, but although there was intense\r\nfeeling it was conducted in perfectly temperate and respectful\r\nlanguage. Those participating were Rachel Foster Avery, Katie R.\r\nAddison, Henry B. Blackwell, Alice Stone Blackwell, Carrie Chapman\r\nCatt, Annie L. Diggs, Laura M. Johns, Helen Morris Lewis, Anna Howard\r\nShaw, Frances A. Williamson and Elizabeth U. Yates speaking for the\r\nresolution; Lillie Devereux Blake, Clara B. Colby, Cornelia H. Cary,\r\nLavina A. Hatch, Harriette A. Keyser, J. B. Merwin, Caroline Hallowell\r\nMiller, Althea B. Stryker, Charlotte Perkins Stetson, Mary Bentley\r\nThomas and Victoria C. Whitney speaking against it.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was thoroughly aroused and, leaving the chair, spoke\r\nagainst the resolution as follows:\r\n\r\n     The one distinct feature of our association has been the right of\r\n     individual opinion for every member. We have been beset at each\r\n     step with the cry that somebody was injuring the cause by the\r\n     expression of sentiments which differed from those held by the\r\n     majority. The religious persecution of the ages has been carried\r\n     on under what was claimed to be the command of God. I distrust\r\n     those people who know so well what God wants them to do, because\r\n     I notice it always coincides with their own desires. All the way\r\n     along the history of our movement there has been this same\r\n     contest on account of religious theories. Forty years ago one of\r\n     our noblest men said to me: \"You would better never hold another\r\n     convention than allow Ernestine L. Rose on your platform;\"\r\n     because that eloquent woman, who ever stood for justice and\r\n     freedom, did not believe in the plenary inspiration of the Bible.\r\n     Did we banish Mrs. Rose? No, indeed!\r\n\r\n     Every new generation of converts threshes over the same old\r\n     straw. The point is whether you will sit in judgment on one who\r\n     questions the divine inspiration of certain passages in the Bible\r\n     derogatory to women. If Mrs. Stanton had written approvingly of\r\n     these passages you would not have brought in this resolution for\r\n     fear the cause might be injured among the _liberals_ in religion.\r\n     In other words, if she had written _your_ views, you would not\r\n     have considered a resolution necessary. To pass this one is to\r\n     set back the hands on the dial of reform.\r\n\r\n     What you should say to outsiders is that a Christian has neither\r\n     more nor less rights in our association than an atheist. When our\r\n     platform becomes too narrow for people of all creeds and of no\r\n     creeds, I myself can not stand upon it. Many things have been\r\n     said and done by our _orthodox_ friends which I have felt to be\r\n     extremely harmful to our cause; but I should no more consent to a\r\n     resolution denouncing them than I shall consent to this. Who is\r\n     to draw the line? Who can tell now whether these commentaries may\r\n     not prove a great help to woman's emancipation from old\r\n     superstitions which have barred its way?\r\n\r\n     Lucretia Mott at first thought Mrs. Stanton had injured the cause\r\n     of all woman's other rights by insisting upon the demand for\r\n     suffrage, but she had sense enough not to bring in a resolution\r\n     against it. In 1860 when Mrs. Stanton made a speech before the\r\n     New York Legislature in favor of a bill making drunkenness a\r\n     ground for divorce, there was a general cry among the friends\r\n     that she had killed the woman's cause. I shall be pained beyond\r\n     expression if the delegates here are so narrow and illiberal as\r\n     to adopt this resolution. You would better not begin resolving\r\n     against individual action or you will find no limit. This year it\r\n     is Mrs. Stanton; next year it may be I or one of yourselves who\r\n     will be the victim.\r\n\r\n     If we do not inspire in women a broad and catholic spirit, they\r\n     will fail, when enfranchised, to constitute that power for better\r\n     government which we have always claimed for them. Ten women\r\n     educated into the practice of liberal principles would be a\r\n     stronger force than 10,000 organized on a platform of intolerance\r\n     and bigotry. I pray you vote for religious liberty, without\r\n     censorship or inquisition. This resolution adopted will be a vote\r\n     of censure upon a woman who is without a peer in intellectual and\r\n     statesmanlike ability; one who has stood for half a century the\r\n     acknowledged leader of progressive thought and demand in regard\r\n     to all matters pertaining to the absolute freedom of women.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this eloquent appeal the original resolution was\r\nadopted by 53 yeas, 41 nays.[108]\r\n\r\nAt the request of about thirty of the delegates, mostly from the far\r\nWestern States, Miss Anthony sent a message to Mrs. Cleveland asking\r\nthat they might be permitted to call upon her, and she received them\r\nwith much courtesy.\r\n\r\nThe association decided to help California and Idaho in whatever\r\nmanner was desired in their approaching campaigns for a woman suffrage\r\namendment. Invitations for holding the national convention were\r\nreceived from Springfield, Ill.; Denver, Col.; Cincinnati, O.; St.\r\nLouis, Mo.; Portland, Ore.; Charleston, S. C. It was voted to leave\r\nthe matter to the business committee, who later accepted an invitation\r\nfrom Des Moines, Ia., as the suffrage societies of that State were\r\norganizing to secure an amendment from the Legislature.\r\n\r\nAt the last meeting, on Tuesday evening, every inch of space was\r\noccupied and people were clinging to the window sills. Miss Anthony\r\nstated that since Frederick Douglass was no longer among them as he\r\nhad been for so many years, his grandson, Joseph Douglass, who was an\r\naccomplished violinist, would give two selections in his memory.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lillie Devereux Blake (N. Y.), spoke on Presidential Candidates\r\nand the Interests of Women, outlining the attitude of the various\r\nnominees and parties. Miss Harriet May Mills (N. Y.) discussed Our\r\nUnconscious Allies, the Remonstrants, illustrating from her experience\r\nas organizer how their efforts really help the cause they try to\r\nhinder. Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe (Ills.), in demonstrating that The\r\nLiberty of the Mother means the Liberty of the Race, showed the need\r\nof truer companionship between man and woman and that the political\r\ndisabilities of women affect all humanity. This was further\r\nillustrated by Mrs. Annie L. Diggs (Kas.) under the topic Women as\r\nLegislators. She said in part:\r\n\r\n     You have before you a great problem as to whether republican\r\n     government itself is to be successful at this time, and statesmen\r\n     to save their souls can not tell what will be the outcome. We\r\n     believe that women have in their possession what is needed to\r\n     make it a success--those things upon which are built the home\r\n     life and the ethical life of the nation. We can supply what is\r\n     lacking, not because women are better than men, but because they\r\n     are other than men; because they have a supplementary part, and\r\n     it is their mission to guard most sacredly and closely those\r\n     things which protect the home life. Because of their womanhood,\r\n     because of their divine function of motherhood, women must always\r\n     be most closely concerned with the matters that pertain to the\r\n     home. It belongs to man, with his strong right arm, to pioneer\r\n     the way, and then woman comes along to help him build the\r\n     enduring foundation upon which everything rests.\r\n\r\nMiss Shaw, in a short, good-naturedly sarcastic speech on The Bulwarks\r\nof the Constitution, showed the illogical position of President Eliot\r\nof Harvard in declaiming grand sentiments in favor of universal\r\nsuffrage and then protesting against having them applied to women. The\r\nlast number on the program was The Ballot as an Improver of\r\nMotherhood, by Mrs. Stetson. It was an address of wonderful power\r\nwhich thrilled the audience. Among other original statements were\r\nthese:\r\n\r\n     We have heard much of the superior moral sense of woman. It is\r\n     superior in spots but not as a whole.... Here is an imaginary\r\n     case which will show how undeveloped in some respects woman's\r\n     moral sense still is: Suppose a train was coming with a\r\n     children's picnic on board--three hundred merry, laughing\r\n     children. Suppose you saw this train was about to go through an\r\n     open switch and over an embankment, and your own child was\r\n     playing on the track in front of it. You could turn the switch\r\n     and save the train, or save your own child by pulling it off the\r\n     track, but there was not time to do both. Which would you do? I\r\n     have put that question to hundreds of women. I never have found\r\n     one but said she would save her own child, and not one in a\r\n     hundred but claimed this would be absolutely right. The maternal\r\n     instinct is stronger in the hearts of most women than any moral\r\n     sense....\r\n\r\n     What is the suffrage going to do for motherhood? Women enter\r\n     upon this greatest function of life without any preparation, and\r\n     their mothers permit them to do it because they do not recognize\r\n     motherhood as a business. We do not let a man practice as a\r\n     doctor or a druggist, or do anything else which involves issues\r\n     of life and death, without training and certificates; but the\r\n     life and death of the whole human race are placed in the hands of\r\n     utterly untrained young girls. The suffrage draws the woman out\r\n     of her purely personal relations and puts her in relations with\r\n     her kind, and it broadens her intelligence. I am not disparaging\r\n     the noble devotion of our present mothers--I know how they\r\n     struggle and toil--but when that tremendous force of mother love\r\n     is made intelligent, fifty per cent of our children will not die\r\n     before they are five years old, and those that grow up will be\r\n     better men and women. A woman will no longer be attached solely\r\n     to one little group, but will be also a member of the community.\r\n     She will not neglect her own on that account, but will be better\r\n     to them and of more worth as a mother.\r\n\r\nMrs. Stetson closed with her own fine poem, Mother to Child.\r\n\r\nThe usual congressional hearings were held on Tuesday morning, January\r\n28.[109] The speakers were presented by Miss Shaw, who made a very\r\nstrong closing argument. At its conclusion Senator Peffer announced\r\nhis thorough belief in woman suffrage, and Senator Hoar planted\r\nhimself still more firmly in the favorable position he always had\r\nmaintained.[110]\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony led the host before the Judiciary Committee of the House,\r\nand opened with the statement that the women had been coming here\r\nasking for justice for nearly thirty years. She gave a brief account\r\nof the status of the question before Congress and then presented her\r\nspeakers, each occupying the exact limit of time allotted and each\r\ntaking up a different phase of the question.[111] Miss Anthony called\r\non Representative John F. Shafroth of Colorado, who was among the\r\nlisteners, to say something in regard to the experiment in his State.\r\nHe spoke in unqualified approval, saying: \"In the election of 1894 a\r\ngreater per cent. of women voted than men, and instead of their being\r\ncontaminated by any influence of a bad nature at the polls, the effect\r\nhas been that there are no loafers, there are no drunkards, there are\r\nno persons of questionable character standing around the polls. One of\r\nthe practical effects of woman suffrage will be to inject into\r\npolitics an element that is independent and does not have to keep a\r\nconsistent record with the party. We find that the ladies of Colorado\r\ndo not care whether they vote for one ticket or the other, but they\r\nvote for the men they think the most deserving. Consequently if a man\r\nis nominated who has a questionable record invariably they will strike\r\nthe party that does it. That tendency, I care not where it may exist,\r\nmust be for good.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony closed with an earnest appeal that the committee would\r\nreport in favor of a Sixteenth Amendment to the Constitution, thus\r\nenabling the women to carry their case to the Legislatures of the\r\ndifferent States instead of to the masses of voters. She then\r\nsubmitted for publication and distribution the address of Mrs.\r\nStanton, which said in part:\r\n\r\n     There is not a principle of our Government, not an article or\r\n     section of our Constitution, from the preamble to the last\r\n     amendment, which we have not elucidated and applied to woman\r\n     suffrage before the various committees in able arguments that\r\n     have never been answered. Our failure to secure justice thus far\r\n     has not been due to any lack of character or ability in our\r\n     advocates or of strength in their propositions, but to the\r\n     popular prejudices against woman's emancipation. Eloquent,\r\n     logical arguments on any question, though based on justice,\r\n     science, morals and religion, are all as light as air in the\r\n     balance with old theories, creeds, codes and customs.\r\n\r\n     Could we resurrect from the archives of this Capitol all the\r\n     petitions and speeches presented here by women for human freedom\r\n     during this century, they would reach above this dome and make a\r\n     more fitting pedestal for the Goddess of Liberty than the\r\n     crowning point of an edifice beneath which the mother of the race\r\n     has so long pleaded in vain for her natural right of\r\n     self-government--a right her sons should have secured to her long\r\n     ago of their own free will by statutes carved indelibly on the\r\n     corner-stones of the Republic.\r\n\r\n     As arguments have thus far proved unavailing, may not appeals to\r\n     your feelings, to your moral sense, find the response so long\r\n     withheld by your reason? Allow me, honorable gentlemen, to paint\r\n     you a picture and bring within the compass of your vision at once\r\n     the comparative position of two classes of citizens: The central\r\n     object is a ballot box guarded by three inspectors of foreign\r\n     birth. On the right is a multitude of coarse, ignorant beings,\r\n     designated in our constitutions as male citizens--many of them\r\n     fresh from the steerage of incoming steamers. There, too, are\r\n     natives of the same type from the slums of our cities. Policemen\r\n     are respectfully guiding them all to the ballot box. Those who\r\n     can not stand, because of their frequent potations, are carefully\r\n     supported on either side, each in turn depositing his vote, for\r\n     what purpose he neither knows nor cares, except to get the\r\n     promised bribe.\r\n\r\n     On the left stand a group of intelligent, moral,\r\n     highly-cultivated women, whose ancestors for generations have\r\n     fought the battles of liberty and have made this country all it\r\n     is to-day. These come from the schools and colleges as teachers\r\n     and professors; from the press and pulpit as writers and\r\n     preachers; from the courts and hospitals as lawyers and\r\n     physicians; and from happy and respectable homes as honored\r\n     mothers, wives and sisters. Knowing the needs of humanity\r\n     subjectively in all the higher walks of life, and objectively in\r\n     the world of work, in the charities, in the asylums and prisons,\r\n     in the sanitary condition of our streets and public buildings,\r\n     they are peculiarly fitted to write, speak and vote intelligently\r\n     on all these questions of such vital, far-reaching consequence to\r\n     the welfare of society. But the inspectors refuse their votes\r\n     because they are not designated in the Constitution as \"male\"\r\n     citizens, and the policemen drive them away.\r\n\r\n     Sad and humiliated they retire to their respective abodes,\r\n     followed by the jeers of those in authority. Imagine the feelings\r\n     of these dignified women, returning to their daily round of\r\n     duties, compelled to leave their interests, public and private,\r\n     in the State and the home, to these ignorant masses. The most\r\n     grievous result of war to the conquered is wearing a foreign\r\n     yoke, yet this is the position of the daughters of the\r\n     Puritans....\r\n\r\n     What a dark page the present political position of women will be\r\n     for the future historian! In reading of the republics of Greece\r\n     and Rome and the grand utterances of their philosophers in pæans\r\n     to liberty, we wonder that under such governments there should\r\n     have been a class of citizens held in slavery. Our descendants\r\n     will be still more surprised to know that our disfranchised\r\n     citizens, our pariahs, our slaves, belonged to the most highly\r\n     educated, moral, virtuous class in the nation, women of wealth\r\n     and position who paid millions of taxes every year into the State\r\n     and national treasuries; women who had given thousands to build\r\n     colleges and churches and to encourage the sciences and arts.\r\n     From the dawn of creation to this hour history affords no other\r\n     instance of so large a class of such a character subordinated\r\n     politically to the ignorant masses.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[105] Letters and telegrams of greeting were received from the Hon.\r\nMrs. C.

Circumstances were unfavorable, the\r\nthermometer registering twenty-four degrees below zero and a heavy\r\nblizzard prevailing throughout the West. Nevertheless sixty-three\r\ndelegates, representing twenty States, were present. All the visitors\r\nwere entertained in the hospitable homes of this city, and the entire\r\nexecutive board were the guests of James and Martha C. Callanan at\r\ntheir handsome home in the suburbs. Receptions were given by the Des\r\nMoines Woman's Club, by the Young Women's Christian Association and by\r\nMr. and Mrs. F. M. Hubbell at their palatial residence, Terrace Hill.\r\nThe convention was welcomed in behalf of the State by Gov. Francis M.\r\nDrake, who paid the highest possible tribute to the social and\r\nintellectual qualities of women, pointed out the liberality of Iowa in\r\nrespect to manhood suffrage and congratulated the association\r\ngenerally, but was extremely careful not to commit himself on the\r\nquestion of woman suffrage. Mayor John McVicar extended the welcome of\r\nthe city in eloquent language. He also skirted all around the suffrage\r\nquestion, came much nearer an expression of approval than did the\r\nGovernor, but cleverly avoided a direct assertion in favor. He was\r\nfollowed by the Rev. H. O. Breeden, pastor of the Christian Church in\r\nwhich the convention was assembled. Not being in politics he dared\r\nexpress an honest opinion and said in the course of his remarks:\r\n\r\n[Illustration: (MISS ANTHONY'S CABINET IN 1900.)\r\n\r\n  CATHARINE WAUGH McCULLOCH.\r\n  Second Auditor.\r\n\r\n          ALICE STONE BLACKWELL.\r\n          Recording Secretary.\r\n\r\n      RACHEL FOSTER AVERY.\r\n      Corresponding Secretary 21 Years.\r\n\r\n  LAURA CLAY.\r\n  First Auditor.\r\n\r\n          HARRIET TAYLOR UPTON.\r\n          Treasurer.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\n     It is my privilege to address you in behalf of the churches, and\r\n     I do so with great pleasure, because I have a robust faith that\r\n     you are right, and also that the churches are with you in\r\n     sympathy and heart. I belong to one which welcomes women to its\r\n     pulpit and to all its offices. I should distrust the Christianity\r\n     of any that would deny to my mother and wife the rights it\r\n     accords to my father and myself. We welcome you to this city of\r\n     churches and to the churches of the city, and to its homes.\r\n\r\n     Woman shows her capacity for the highest functions in proportion\r\n     as she is admitted to them. I hold it true, with Dr. Storrs, that\r\n     as Dante measured his progress in Paradise not by outer objects\r\n     but by the increased beauty upon the face of Beatrice, so the\r\n     progress of the race is measured by the increasing beauty of\r\n     character shown in its women. The fanaticism of yesterday is the\r\n     reform of to-day, and the victory of to-morrow. Truth always goes\r\n     onward and never back. The day of equal rights for women is\r\n     surely coming. You are fighting a good warfare, with God, with\r\n     conscience and with right to inspire you, and the triumph is near\r\n     at hand.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mattie Locke Macomber extended the greetings of the Women's Clubs\r\nof the State; Mrs. Adelaide Ballard, president of the Iowa Suffrage\r\nAssociation, presented its welcome, and greetings were read from\r\nvarious Women's Christian Temperance Unions. Miss Anthony responded\r\nbriefly, contrasting the welcome by Governor, mayor and different\r\nsocieties with the olden times when perhaps not one person would\r\nextend a friendly hand to those who attempted to hold a suffrage\r\nmeeting. \"I hardly know what to say now,\" she continued. \"It is so\r\nmuch easier to speak when brickbats are flying. But I do rejoice with\r\nyou over the immense revolution and evolution of the past twenty-five\r\nyears, and I thank you for this cordial greeting.\"\r\n\r\nThe meetings were held in the large and well-arranged Christian\r\nChurch, with an auditorium seating 1,500. The four daily papers gave\r\nfull and fair reports and, although there was no editorial\r\nendorsement, there was no adverse comment. The _Leader_ thus described\r\nthe opening session, Tuesday afternoon:\r\n\r\n     It is doubtful if the church ever before held so many people.\r\n     They poured in at all the doors, and the great audience room,\r\n     with the balconies and the windows, the choir and the aisles, the\r\n     platform and every foot of available space, was early occupied.\r\n     There were many gentlemen in the audience, but probably four of\r\n     every five were women. The men had come, apparently, to see and\r\n     hear Miss Anthony; and when she was done many of them left. It\r\n     was such an audience as is not often seen. The ladies were\r\n     generally elderly, the great majority beyond middle-age; they had\r\n     braved the cold and wind to hear the leader whom they had known\r\n     and loved for many years, but whom most of them had never seen.\r\n     Their bright faces framed in silvery hair, with brighter eyes\r\n     upturned to the speakers, must have been an inspiration to those\r\n     on the platform; in the case of Miss Anthony it was plain that\r\n     she was indeed inspired by her audience.\r\n\r\nThere was much rejoicing over the enfranchisement of the women of\r\nIdaho by an amendment to the State constitution during the past year;\r\nand much sorrow over the defeat of a similar amendment in California.\r\nIn her president's address Miss Anthony said in part:\r\n\r\n     The year 1896 witnessed greater successes than any since the\r\n     first pronunciamento was made at Seneca Falls, N. Y., July 19,\r\n     1848. On January 6 President Cleveland proclaimed Utah to be a\r\n     State, with a constitution which does not discriminate against\r\n     women. With Utah and Wyoming we have two States coming into the\r\n     Union with the principle of equal rights to women guaranteed by\r\n     their constitutions.\r\n\r\n     On November 3 the men of Idaho declared in favor of woman\r\n     suffrage, and for the first time in the history of judicial\r\n     decisions upon the enlargement of women's rights, civil and\r\n     political, a Supreme Court gave a broad interpretation of the\r\n     constitution. The Supreme Court of Idaho--Isaac N. Sullivan,\r\n     Joseph W. Huston, John T. Morgan--unanimously decided that the\r\n     amendment was carried constitutionally. This decision is the more\r\n     remarkable because the Court might as easily have declared that\r\n     the constitution requires amendments to receive a majority of the\r\n     total vote cast at the election, instead of a majority of the\r\n     votes cast on the amendment itself. By the former construction it\r\n     would have been lost, notwithstanding two to one of all who\r\n     expressed an opinion were in favor.\r\n\r\n     If anyone will study the history of our woman suffrage movement\r\n     since the days of reconstruction and the adoption of the\r\n     Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to the Federal\r\n     Constitution--taking the decisions of the Supreme Court of the\r\n     United States in the cases of Mrs. Myra Bradwell for the\r\n     protection of her civil rights; of Mrs. Virginia L. Minor for the\r\n     protection of her political rights; of the law granting Municipal\r\n     Suffrage to women in Michigan; on giving women the right to vote\r\n     for County School Commissioners in New York, and various other\r\n     decisions--he will find that in every case the courts have put\r\n     the narrowest possible construction upon the spirit and the\r\n     letter of the constitution. The Judges of Idaho did themselves\r\n     the honor to make a decision in direct opposition to judicial\r\n     precedent and prejudice. The Idaho victory is a great credit not\r\n     only to the majority of men who voted for the amendment, but to\r\n     the three Judges who made this broad and just decision.\r\n\r\nAfter sketching the situation in California, and relating the part\r\ntaken by the National Association in these two campaigns, she\r\nconcluded:\r\n\r\n     In every county which was properly organized, with a committee in\r\n     every precinct, who visited every voter and distributed leaflets\r\n     in every family, the amendment received a majority vote. This\r\n     ought to be sufficient to teach the women of all the States that\r\n     what we need is house-to-house educational work throughout every\r\n     voting precinct. We may possibly carry amendments with education\r\n     short of this, but we are not likely to. I believe if the slums\r\n     of San Francisco and Oakland had been thus organized, even the\r\n     men there could have been made to see that it was for their\r\n     interest and that of their wives and daughters to vote for the\r\n     amendment. But, while the suffragists had no committees whatever\r\n     in those districts, the \"liquor men\" had an active committee in\r\n     every saloon, \"dive\" and gambling house. I am, therefore, more\r\n     and more convinced that it is educational work which needs to be\r\n     done. It is of little use for us to make our appeals to political\r\n     party conventions, State Legislatures or Congress for resolutions\r\n     in favor of woman's enfranchisement, while no appeal comes up to\r\n     them from the rank and file of the voters.\r\n\r\n     Until we do this kind of house-to-house work we can never expect\r\n     to carry any of the States in which there are large cities. If\r\n     Idaho had had San Francisco, with all its liquor interests and\r\n     foreigners banded together, she would probably have been defeated\r\n     as was California.\r\n\r\n     So, friends, I am not in any sense disheartened, and while I\r\n     rejoice exceedingly over Idaho, I also rejoice exceedingly over\r\n     the grand work done in California, and over the 110,000 votes\r\n     given for woman suffrage in that State. It was vastly more than\r\n     was ever done in any other amendment campaign. Study then the\r\n     methods of California and Idaho and improve on them as much as\r\n     you possibly can.\r\n\r\nThe Des Moines _Leader_ thus finished its report:\r\n\r\n     It was not difficult for one who saw Miss Anthony for the first\r\n     time to understand why she is so well beloved by her associates.\r\n     Seventy-seven years old, she is the most earnest worker of them\r\n     all; she is not only their leader but their counsellor and\r\n     friend. While she occupied the platform the utmost solicitude was\r\n     manifested for her on the part of everybody. Once a glass of\r\n     water was sent for but did not come as soon as it should, and\r\n     everyone on the stage was visibly concerned except Miss Anthony\r\n     herself, who calmly observed, by way of apology for a trifling\r\n     difficulty with her voice, that she was not accustomed to speak\r\n     in public, at which a laugh went round.... Her silvery hair was\r\n     parted in the middle and brushed down over her ears. Her eyes\r\n     have the deep-set appearance which is characteristic of elderly\r\n     people who have been hard mental laborers, but on the whole she\r\n     did not look all her years, though older than most of her hearers\r\n     had expected to see her. But those beaming, earnest eyes, taking\r\n     in her whole audience as she talked, told of a nature tenacious\r\n     of purpose and not to be daunted by any obstacle--the qualities\r\n     which in her many years' work in the cause Miss Anthony has so\r\n     many times manifested.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Anna Howard Shaw devoted the most of her report as\r\nvice-president-at-large to the California campaign, as she had spent\r\nthe greater part of the past year in that State. She closed by saying:\r\n\"Our reception by the Californians was such as to make them forever\r\ndear to us. I wish you could have seen Miss Anthony for once walking\r\nankle-deep in roses. It showed that the sentiment for suffrage had\r\nreached the point where its advocates not only were tolerated but\r\nhonored. I used to like to see her sitting in a chair all adorned with\r\nflowers and with a laurel crown suspended over her head, and to feel\r\nthat it was woman suffrage that was crowned. The work was hard, but we\r\nall came back from California better in health and stronger in hope.\"\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday evening the crowd was so great it became necessary to\r\nhold an overflow meeting, which was attended by five hundred persons.\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, who was introduced as \"one of Iowa's own\r\ndaughters,\" was received with great applause. She said in part:\r\n\r\n     I have a deep and tender love for Iowa. When I cross her\r\n     boundary, I always feel that I am coming home. In my travels\r\n     through the West I meet many men and women who give me a warmer\r\n     hand-shake because they too are from Iowa. But this State no\r\n     longer occupies the first place in my heart. There are four that\r\n     I love better, and every woman here feels the same. The first is\r\n     Wyoming. Many pass through that State and see only a barren plain\r\n     covered with sage brush, but when I cross her border, I feel a\r\n     thrill as sacred as ever the crusaders felt in visiting the Holy\r\n     Land. The second State is Colorado, the third Utah, and the\r\n     fourth Idaho. All of us Iowa women will love these States better\r\n     than our own until it shall arouse and place its laws and\r\n     institutions on an equality for women and men....\r\n\r\n     We ask suffrage in order to make womanhood broader and motherhood\r\n     nobler. Men and women are inextricably bound together. If we are\r\n     to have a great race, we must have a great motherhood. Do you ask\r\n     why people can not see this? In all history no class has been\r\n     enfranchised without some selfish motive underlying. If to-day we\r\n     could prove to Republicans or Democrats that every woman would\r\n     vote for their party, we should be enfranchised.\r\n\r\n     Do you say that whenever all women wish the ballot they will have\r\n     it? That time will never come. Not all of any class of men ever\r\n     wanted to vote till the ballot was put into their hands. When the\r\n     first woman desired to study medicine, not one school would admit\r\n     her. Since that time, only half a century ago, 25,000 women have\r\n     been admitted to the practice of medicine. If a popular vote had\r\n     been necessary, not one of them would yet have her diploma. We\r\n     have gained these advantages because we did not have to ask\r\n     society for them. If woman suffrage were granted in Iowa, women\r\n     would soon wish to vote, and every home would become a forum of\r\n     education....\r\n\r\nThere never had been so many deaths in the ranks as during the past\r\nyear. The following were among the names presented by Mrs. Clara\r\nBewick Colby as those whom the association would ever hold in reverent\r\nmemory:\r\n\r\n     Hannah Tracy Cutler of Illinois, former president of the American\r\n     Association and one of the earliest and most self-sacrificing of\r\n     woman suffrage lecturers; Sarah B. Cooper of California, auditor\r\n     of this association, whose labors for the enfranchisement of the\r\n     women of the Pacific coast will be remembered and honored equally\r\n     with her beneficent work in founding and sustaining free\r\n     kindergartens, and in whatever promoted justice, truth and mercy,\r\n     so that on the day of her funeral all the flags in San Francisco\r\n     were placed at half-mast; Mary Grew, who began her work for\r\n     freedom as corresponding secretary of the Philadelphia Female\r\n     Anti-Slavery Society in 1834, one of the founders of the New\r\n     Century Club of Philadelphia, and of the Pennsylvania Woman\r\n     Suffrage Association, of which she was president for twenty-three\r\n     years; Elizabeth McClintock Phillips, who in 1848 signed the call\r\n     for the first convention which demanded the ballot for women; J.\r\n     Elizabeth Jones of New York, a pioneer in anti-slavery and woman\r\n     suffrage; Judge E. T. Merrick of New Orleans, whose home was ever\r\n     open to the woman suffrage lecturers in that section, and who by\r\n     his eminent position as Chief Justice of Louisiana for many\r\n     years, sustained his wife in work which in earlier days but for\r\n     him would have been impossible; Eliza Murphy of New Jersey, who\r\n     bequeathed five hundred dollars to this association; Harriet\r\n     Beecher Stowe of Connecticut, who, although the apostle of\r\n     freedom in another field, yet held as firmly and expressed as\r\n     steadfastly her allegiance to the cause of woman suffrage; Dr.\r\n     Caroline B. Winslow, the earliest woman physician in the District\r\n     of Columbia, intrepid as a journalist, successful in practice, a\r\n     leader in many lines of reform; Maria G. Porter of Rochester, N.\r\n     Y.; Sarah Hussey Southwick of Massachusetts, a worker in the\r\n     cause of liberty for more than sixty years; Kate Field of\r\n     Washington, D. C.; Gov. Frederick T. Greenhalge of Massachusetts;\r\n     Dr. Hiram Corson of Pennsylvania, who stood for the full\r\n     opportunities of women in medicine, and secured the opening to\r\n     them of the conservative medical societies of Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe names of over thirty other tried and true friends who had passed\r\naway during the months since the last meeting were given. Mrs. Colby\r\nclosed the memorial service by saying:\r\n\r\n     The best that comes to this world comes through the love of\r\n     liberty. These were souls of noble aspiration and undaunted\r\n     courage. We enter into their labors; we will enshrine them in the\r\n     history of the suffrage movement and bear them gratefully in our\r\n     hearts forever. May our lives be as fruitful as theirs, and when\r\n     we too pass away may we\r\n\r\n    \"Join the choir invisible\r\n    Of these immortal dead who live again,\r\n    In minds made better by their presence.\"\r\n\r\nAmong letters received was one from Parker Pillsbury (N. H.), now 88\r\nyears old, who had spoken so eloquently in early days for the\r\nemancipation of the slaves and the freedom of women. One of the many\r\nexcellent addresses was on the general topic Equal Rights, by Miss\r\nAlice Stone Blackwell (Mass.), illustrated by a number of the piquant\r\nand appropriate stories for which she is noted and which perhaps leave\r\na more lasting impression than a labored argument. Mrs. Catharine\r\nWaugh McCulloch, a practicing lawyer of Chicago, considered the\r\nhackneyed phrase All the Rights We Want, showing up in a humorous way\r\nthe legal disabilities of women in her own State. The wife's earnings\r\nmay be seized to pay for her husband's clothes; she can not testify\r\nagainst her husband; she can not enter into a business partnership\r\nwithout his consent; a married mother has no right to her children;\r\nthe age of protection for girls is only fourteen, etc.\r\n\r\nPresident George A. Gates of Iowa College said in part: \"I never heard\r\nor read a single sound argument against the suffrage of women in a\r\ndemocracy. There are a hundred arguments for it. The question now is\r\none of organization, of agitation, of perseverance. In my judgment he\r\nwho sneers at suffrage not only proclaims himself a boor and casts\r\ndiscredit on at least four women--his mother, his wife, his sister and\r\nhis daughter--but he reveals a depth of ignorance that is pitiable.\r\nLet the appeal be to experience. Not one of the direful consequences\r\npredicted has come to pass where suffrage is enjoyed. Homes have not\r\nbeen deserted, bad women have not flocked to the polls, conjugal\r\nstrife has not been aroused, bad effects have not come but good\r\neffects have. Bad men seek office in vain where women have the ballot.\r\nNew States are coming into line and the triumph of the cause can not\r\nmuch longer be delayed.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Charlotte Perkins Stetson spoke with her usual ability on Duty\r\nand Honor:\r\n\r\n     Underlying the objections to woman suffrage is a reason of which,\r\n     as an American, I am deeply ashamed. I do not think either men or\r\n     women have the same honest pride in our democracy that they had\r\n     fifty years ago. We are becoming a little afraid of what Europe\r\n     has always told us was an experiment, but one reason it has not\r\n     yet been all we could wish is that it is not a democracy at all,\r\n     but a semi-democracy, one-half of the race ruling over the other\r\n     half.\r\n\r\n     Another deep-seated feeling is that, while development is the\r\n     general rule, yet the production of the best men and women\r\n     requires \"the maternal sacrifice,\" _i. e._ that the mother shall\r\n     be sacrificed to her children, and incidentally to her husband.\r\n     If the sacrifice is necessary, well and good; but how if it is\r\n     not?... It has been regarded as dangerous to improve the\r\n     condition of women for fear they would not be as good mothers. If\r\n     gain to the mother means robbery to the child, let the mother\r\n     remain as she is. But the standard is the amount of good done to\r\n     the children, not the amount of evil done to herself....\r\n\r\n     Grant that it is a woman's business to take care of her\r\n     children--not merely of her own children. If children anywhere\r\n     are not under right conditions, women ought to see to it. The\r\n     trouble is we are too wrapped up in _my_ children to think of\r\n     _our_ children. We can not keep out disease by shutting our own\r\n     front door. We have to know and care about the world outside our\r\n     gates. In order to do our duty to our children we must make this\r\n     world a better place to live in.\r\n\r\n     Our children are not born with that degree of brain power that we\r\n     could wish. They will not be, until our minds are widened by\r\n     study of the whole duty of a human being.... What is needed for\r\n     women is an enlargement of their moral sense so as to include\r\n     social as well as private virtues. We have been taught that there\r\n     is only one virtue for us. Our morality is high but narrow. It is\r\n     not wholesome to limit oneself to one virtue, or to six or to\r\n     ten. Sons resemble their mothers. While mothers limit their\r\n     interests to their own narrow domestic affairs, regardless of the\r\n     world outside, their sons will betray the interests of the\r\n     country for their own private business interests.... Women and\r\n     men are so connected that we can not improve one without\r\n     improving the other. Under equal rights we shall raise the moral\r\n     sense of the community by the natural laws of transmission\r\n     through the mothers. We shall learn to blame a man as much if he\r\n     betrays a public trust as we do if he deserts his wife.\r\n\r\n     Have we done our full duty when we have loved and served and\r\n     taken care of those that every beast on earth loves and serves\r\n     and takes care of--our own young? That is the beginning of human\r\n     duty but not the whole of it. The duty of woman is not confined\r\n     to the reproduction of the species; it extends to the working of\r\n     the will of God on earth. The family is a leaf on the tree of the\r\n     State. It can grow in strength and purity while the State is\r\n     healthy, but when the State is degraded the family becomes\r\n     degraded with it. We have not done our full duty to the family\r\n     till we have done our best to serve the State.\r\n\r\nMiss Shaw took up this subject, saying:\r\n\r\n     The millennium will not come as soon as women vote, but it will\r\n     not come until they do vote. If a woman has only a little brain,\r\n     she has a right to the fullest development of all she has.... If\r\n     we are to keep our children healthy, as Mrs. Stetson says is our\r\n     duty, pure water is essential. I know a city (Philadelphia) where\r\n     you can fast for forty days, drinking only water, and grow\r\n     fat--because you have chowder every time. Is there any reason why\r\n     women should not have a vote in regard to water-works? A woman\r\n     knows as much about water as a man. Generally, she drinks more of\r\n     it. See how the street cleaners sweep the dirt into heaps on\r\n     Monday and leave it to blow about until Saturday, before it is\r\n     taken up. Any housekeeper would know better. Sewers and man-traps\r\n     spread disease literally and also metaphorically. You may teach\r\n     your boy every precept in the Bible from beginning to end, and he\r\n     will go out into the street and be taught to violate every one of\r\n     them, under the protection of law, and you can't help yourself or\r\n     him.\r\n\r\nAt one of the morning meetings Miss Anthony said in response to a\r\nmessage from the W. C. T. U. accompanied by a great bunch of daisies:\r\n\"We always are glad to receive greetings from this society, because\r\none of its forty departments is for the franchise. The suffrage\r\nassociation has only one, but that one aims to make every State a true\r\nrepublic.\" She continued: \"A newspaper of this city has criticized the\r\nsuffrage banner with its four stars and has accused us of desecrating\r\nour country's flag. But no one ever heard anything about desecration\r\nof the flag during the political campaign, when the names and\r\nportraits of all the candidates were tacked to it. Our critics compare\r\nus to Texas and its lone star. We have not gone out of the Union, but\r\nfour States have come in. Keep your flag flying, and do not let any\r\none persuade you that you are desecrating it by putting on stars for\r\nthe States where government is based on the consent of the governed,\r\nand leaving them off for those which are not.\"\r\n\r\nState Senators Rowen, Kilburn and Byers brought an official message\r\ninviting the convention to visit the Senate and select certain of\r\ntheir members to address that body. Each of these gentlemen spoke\r\nbriefly but unequivocally in favor of the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\nThe ladies found the Senate Chamber crowded from top to bottom on the\r\noccasion of their visit Friday morning, and they were welcomed by\r\nLieutenant-Governor Parrott. In her response Miss Anthony called\r\nattention to the fact that the women of Iowa had been pleading their\r\ncause in vain before the Legislature for nearly thirty years. Mrs.\r\nMary C. C. Bradford, Mrs. Emmeline B. Wells and Mrs. Mell C. Woods\r\nspoke for the States of Colorado, Utah and Idaho, which had\r\nenfranchised women; Mrs. Colby represented Wyoming. Clever two-minute\r\nspeeches were made by Mrs. Ballard, Miss Shaw and Mrs. Chapman Catt,\r\nwhich were highly appreciated by the legislators and the rest of the\r\naudience.\r\n\r\nDuring the convention an informal speech of Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton\r\n(O.), As the World Sees Us, was much enjoyed. In the course of her\r\nremarks she said:\r\n\r\n     The world thinks our husbands are inferior men, and I do not like\r\n     it. For fifty years they have said all sorts of things about the\r\n     overbearing suffragists--that they were crazy, tyrannical, etc.,\r\n     but they never have said we were fools. Why should they think\r\n     that we would pick out fools for our husbands?...\r\n\r\n     The world also thinks the suffrage advocates are poor\r\n     housekeepers. I know, for I was in the world a long time and I\r\n     thought so. When I was brought into the movement and visited the\r\n     leaders, I was surprised to find the order and executive ability\r\n     with which their homes were conducted.\r\n\r\n     The world thinks we are office-seekers. Most of us have not the\r\n     slightest wish for office, but we do want to see women serving on\r\n     all boards that deal with matters where woman's help is needed.\r\n\r\n     The world thinks we are irreligious; but our individual churches\r\n     do not think so--for most of us are members of churches in good\r\n     and regular standing, and we are not denied communion. We can not\r\n     be vestrymen, but if the church wants a steam heater it is voted\r\n     to have one, without a cent in the treasury, because the women\r\n     are relied upon to raise the money. We are religious enough to\r\n     have oyster suppers in aid of the church and to make choir-boys'\r\n     vestments and to raise the minister's salary and to make up the\r\n     congregation. Religion is love to God and man. If it is not\r\n     religion to promote a cause that will make men better and women\r\n     wiser and happier, what is it? The world thinks we are\r\n     irreligious because in the early days some of our leaders were\r\n     held to be unorthodox. But most of those who years ago were\r\n     looked upon as such are regarded as orthodox to-day. The\r\n     eye-sight of the world is much better than it used to be....\r\n\r\nThe discussion--_Resolved_, That the propaganda of the woman suffrage\r\nidea demands a non-partisan attitude on the part of individual\r\nworkers--was led by Miss Laura Clay in the affirmative and Henry B.\r\nBlackwell in the negative. Miss Clay said in part:\r\n\r\n     It is a well established rule that the greater should never be\r\n     subordinated to the less. Therefore, suffrage should never be\r\n     made a tail to the kite of any political party. There are\r\n     momentous issues now before the people, but none so momentous as\r\n     woman suffrage. This principle appeals to the conscience of the\r\n     people, and will ultimately convince all those who cherish the\r\n     political principles of our fathers. Already we believe we have\r\n     convinced a sufficient number to make this a practical question.\r\n     We have now to deal with the politicians. They may be divided\r\n     into two classes, men of high ideals and those who cling to\r\n     party, right or wrong. It is necessary to gain both classes.\r\n\r\n     Partisan methods are not suited to the discussion of this\r\n     question. We must show that when enfranchised we shall hold a\r\n     self-preservative attitude; that we know our rights, and, knowing\r\n     them, dare maintain. Wisdom is less tangible than force but more\r\n     powerful in the end. Women are different from men and their\r\n     political methods will differ from those of men. Women will never\r\n     win so long as they consent to barter their services for vague\r\n     promises of what will be done for them in the future, or to\r\n     subordinate woman suffrage to the interests of any party.\r\n\r\n     MR. BLACKWELL: We are all agreed that Woman Suffrage\r\n     Associations, local, State and national, are and must be\r\n     non-partisan. But a clear distinction should be made between the\r\n     attitude of a society and that of the individual women and men\r\n     who compose its membership. Suffrage societies, being composed of\r\n     men and women of all shades of political belief, can not take\r\n     sides on any other question without violating each member's right\r\n     and duty to have and express personal political opinions. But, as\r\n     individuals, it is our duty to be partisans. Woman suffrage is\r\n     not the only issue. In almost every political contest one party\r\n     is right and the other wrong. Everybody is bound to do what he or\r\n     she can to promote the success of the right side. If no moral\r\n     questions were involved, political contests would be ignoble and\r\n     insignificant. We value suffrage mainly because questions of\r\n     right and wrong are settled by votes....\r\n\r\n     Every woman, equally with every man, should be affiliated with\r\n     some political party.... Every manifestation by women of\r\n     intelligent interest in political questions helps woman suffrage.\r\n     Political questions necessarily become party questions, for we\r\n     live under a government of parties.\r\n\r\n     A non-partisan attitude is a phrase which needs definition. If\r\n     \"partisan\" means \"our party, right or wrong,\" then no woman and\r\n     no man should be a partisan. An attitude of moderation and\r\n     conciliation befits every candid person. I am for holding equal\r\n     suffrage paramount to ordinary political questions, but I am not\r\n     for repudiating party ties altogether. Woman suffrage, though the\r\n     most important question, is not always the one to be first\r\n     settled. It is not the only question. Voting, though the most\r\n     direct form of political power, is not the only political power.\r\n     Women's interests and those of their children are involved,\r\n     equally with those of men, in every question of finance,\r\n     currency, tariff, domestic and foreign relations. They have no\r\n     right to be neutral or apathetic. So long as they remain silent\r\n     and inert they command no attention or respect. I maintain,\r\n     therefore, that affirmative political activity, working by and\r\n     through party machinery, is the duty of every individual\r\n     citizen--whether man or woman.\r\n\r\n     In States where a suffrage amendment is pending, in meetings\r\n     where suffrage is advocated, party politics should be laid aside\r\n     for the time being. In religious meetings no distinction should\r\n     be made between Republicans, Democrats or Populists. In political\r\n     meetings no distinction should be made between Methodists,\r\n     Baptists or Presbyterians. In suffrage meetings there should be\r\n     no distinction of sect or party. But we hold our individual\r\n     opinions all the same.\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY: I want to say that you can not possibly divide\r\n     yourself up as Mr. Blackwell suggests. You can not be a\r\n     Republican in one convention to-day and non-partisan in another\r\n     to-morrow. The men who believe in suffrage are voters, and must\r\n     have their parties, of course. But any woman who champions either\r\n     political party makes more votes against than for suffrage. I\r\n     could give numerous examples. Do not be deluded with this idea\r\n     that one party is right and the other wrong. Which is it? One\r\n     party seems right to one-half of the people, and the other party\r\n     to the other half. As long as women have no votes, any one of\r\n     them who will make a speech either for gold or silver or for any\r\n     party issue is lacking in self-respect.\r\n\r\n     MISS BLACKWELL: Miss Clay seems to have understood the question\r\n     presented for discussion in a different sense from what I did. I\r\n     do not believe in making suffrage a tail to any party kite, of\r\n     course; but women as well as men are bound to do what they can to\r\n     promote good government, and hence to promote by all legitimate\r\n     means the party which they believe to be in the right. They will\r\n     inevitably do this more and more as they become more interested\r\n     in public questions. See how many women took part in the late\r\n     campaign, making speeches for gold or silver, not with any eye\r\n     to woman suffrage--for neither party was committed to it--but\r\n     purely for the sake of the welfare of the country, as they\r\n     understood it. I can not agree that they were lacking in\r\n     self-respect....\r\n\r\n     MISS SHAW: I have made only one party speech in my life. That was\r\n     ten years ago, for the Prohibition Party; and if the Lord will\r\n     forgive me, I will never do it again till women vote.\r\n\r\nIn spite of the lively difference of opinion, the meeting adjourned in\r\ngreat good humor and amid considerable laughter.\r\n\r\nThe last session of the convention was a celebration of the suffrage\r\nvictory in Idaho, conducted by representatives of what the association\r\nliked to call \"the free States.\" Mrs. Colby said in behalf of Wyoming:\r\n\r\n     ....No matter if we fill the field of blue with stars, one will\r\n     always shine with peculiar lustre, the star of Wyoming, who\r\n     opened the door of hope for women.\r\n\r\n     There is a beautiful custom in Switzerland among the Alpine\r\n     shepherds. He who, tending his flock among the heights, first\r\n     sees the rays of the rising sun gild the top of the loftiest\r\n     peak, lifts his horn and sounds forth the morning greeting,\r\n     \"Praise the Lord.\" Soon another shepherd catches the radiant\r\n     gleam, and then another and another takes up the reverent\r\n     refrain, until mountain, hill and valley are vocal with praise\r\n     and bathed in the glory of a new day.\r\n\r\n     So the dawn of the day that shall mean freedom for woman and the\r\n     ennobling of the race was first seen by Wyoming, on the crest of\r\n     our continent, and the clarion note was sounded forth, \"Equality\r\n     before the law.\" For a quarter of a century she was the lone\r\n     watcher on the heights to sound the tocsin of freedom. At last\r\n     Colorado, from her splendid snow-covered peaks, answered back in\r\n     grand accord, \"Equality before the law.\" Then on Utah's brow\r\n     shone the sun, and she, too, exultantly joined in the trio,\r\n     \"Equality before the law.\" And now Idaho completes the quartette\r\n     of mountain States which sing the anthem of woman's freedom. Its\r\n     echoes rouse the sleepers everywhere, until from the rock-bound\r\n     coast of the Atlantic to the golden sands of the Pacific resounds\r\n     one resolute and jubilant demand, \"Equality before the law,\" and\r\n     lo, the whole world wakes to the sunlight of liberty!\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary C. C. Bradford, in speaking for Colorado, said:\r\n\r\n     Civilization means self-realization. The level is being slowly\r\n     but surely raised and the atmosphere improved. Freedom for the\r\n     individual, properly guarded, is the ideal to-day. When woman is\r\n     free, the eternal feminine shows itself to be also the truly\r\n     human. Witness Wyoming, with its magnificent school system, its\r\n     equal pay for equal work. Witness Colorado, where women cast 52\r\n     per cent. of the total vote though the State contains a large\r\n     majority of men. What does this show if not that women wish to\r\n     vote? We women believe that election day administers to each of\r\n     us the sacrament of citizenship, and we go, most of us,\r\n     prayerfully and thankfully to partake in this outward and visible\r\n     sign of an inward and spiritual grace....\r\n\r\n     The first time I went to vote I was out of the house just nine\r\n     minutes. The second time I took my little girl along to school,\r\n     stopped in to vote, and then went down town and did my marketing;\r\n     and I was gone twenty minutes. While I was casting my vote the\r\n     men gave my little one a flower. They always decorate the\r\n     polling-places with flowers now, for they know women love beauty.\r\n\r\n     The tone of political conventions has improved since suffrage was\r\n     granted to women. So has the character of the candidates....\r\n     There is no character-builder like responsibility. Every woman's\r\n     club in the State has been turned into a study club, and the\r\n     women are examining public questions for themselves. This is one\r\n     of the best results of equal suffrage.\r\n\r\n     When women obtained the ballot they wanted to know about public\r\n     affairs, and so they asked their husbands at home (every woman\r\n     wants to believe that her husband knows everything), and the\r\n     husbands had to inform themselves in order to answer their wives'\r\n     questions. Equal suffrage has not only educated women and\r\n     elevated the primaries, but it has given back to the State the\r\n     services of her best men, large numbers of whom had got into the\r\n     habit of neglecting their political duties....\r\n\r\nMrs. Emmeline B. Wells said in describing the conditions in Utah:\r\n\r\n     After the ballot was given to women the men soon came to us and\r\n     asked us to help them. We divided on party lines but not rigidly\r\n     so. We helped not only the good men and women of our own party,\r\n     but those of the other. If they put up a Republican or a Democrat\r\n     who is not fit for the position, the women vote against him. In\r\n     all the work I do for the Republicans, I never denounce the\r\n     Democrats....\r\n\r\n     This year the men were more willing to have us go to the\r\n     primaries than we were to go. Even the women who had not wished\r\n     for suffrage voted. I do not mind going to the primaries. I am\r\n     not afraid of men--not the least in the world. I have often been\r\n     on committees with men. I don't think it has hurt me at all, and\r\n     I have learned a great deal. They have always been very good to\r\n     me. We must stand up for the men. We could not do without them.\r\n     Certainly we could not have settled Utah without them. They built\r\n     the bridges and killed the bears; but I think the women worked\r\n     just as hard, in their way....\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Mell C. Woods came forward to speak for Idaho the audience\r\narose and received her with cheers and the waving of handkerchiefs.\r\nShe brought letters of greeting from most of the women's clubs of\r\nthat State, and in a long and beautiful address she said:\r\n\r\n     With her head pillowed in the lap of the North, her feet resting\r\n     in the orchards of the South, her snowy bosom rising to the\r\n     clouds, Idaho lies serene in her beauty of glacier, lake and\r\n     primeval forest, guarding in her verdure-clad mountains vast\r\n     treasures of precious minerals, with the hem of her robe\r\n     embroidered in sapphires and opals.... As representing Idaho,\r\n     first I wish to express the heartfelt gratitude of every equal\r\n     suffragist in our proud and happy State to the National\r\n     Association for the most generous help afforded us in our two\r\n     years' campaign. Without the aid of the devoted women, Mrs.\r\n     DeVoe, Mrs. Chapman Catt, Mrs. Bradford and Mrs. Johns, who made\r\n     the arduous journey to organize our clubs, plead our cause and\r\n     teach us how to work and win, we should not be celebrating\r\n     Idaho's victory to-night....\r\n\r\nAfter describing the great output of the mines and the fruit-producing\r\nvalue of the State, she continued:\r\n\r\n     I fancy few of you know much of the conditions existing in the\r\n     mining country, dotted with camps in every gulch; the\r\n     preponderance of the adult males over the women of maturity; the\r\n     power of the saloon element, and the cosmopolitan character of\r\n     the people--men from all parts of the world, ignorant and\r\n     cultured, depraved and respectable, seeking fame and fortune in\r\n     the far West--no reading-rooms, no lectures, no lyceums, no\r\n     spelling-bees or corn-huskings, the relaxation of the farm hand;\r\n     single men away from home and its influences, forced from the\r\n     draughty lobby of the hotel or tavern to the warmth and comfort\r\n     of the well-appointed saloon.\r\n\r\n     The missionary suffrage work in such places was obliged to be\r\n     quietly done, without any apparent advocacy on the part of men\r\n     who were in reality ardent supporters of our cause, lest the\r\n     saloon element should organize and, by concerted action, crush\r\n     the movement as they did in the State of Washington in 1889; and\r\n     California, too, owes her defeat of the amendment at least\r\n     partially to this cause. Yet you may go far to find nobler men\r\n     than we have in Idaho, and we did not lack able champions. Our\r\n     amendment was carried by more than a two-thirds majority of the\r\n     votes cast upon it.\r\n\r\nThe last address, by the Rev. Ida C. Hultin (Ills.), The Point of\r\nView, was a masterly effort. She said in part:\r\n\r\n     Before any woman is a wife, a sister or a mother she is a human\r\n     being. We ask nothing as women but everything as human beings.\r\n     The sphere of woman is any path that she can tread, any work that\r\n     she can do. Let no one imagine that we wish to be men. In the\r\n     beginning God created them male and female. The principle of\r\n     co-equality is recognized in all of God's kingdom. We are\r\n     beginning to find in the human race, as in the vegetable and the\r\n     animal, that the male and the female are designed to be the\r\n     equals of each other.\r\n\r\n     It is because woman loves her home that she wants her country to\r\n     be pure and holy, so that she may not lose her children when they\r\n     go out from her protection. We want to be women, womanly women,\r\n     stamping the womanliness of our nature upon the country, even as\r\n     the men have stamped the manliness of their nature upon it. The\r\n     home is the sphere of woman and of man also. The home does not\r\n     mean simply bread-making and dish-washing, but also the place\r\n     into which shall enter that which makes pure manhood possible.\r\n     Give woman a chance to do her whole duty. What is education for,\r\n     what is religion for, but as a means to the end of the\r\n     development of humanity? If national life is what it ought to be\r\n     also, a means to the same end, it needs then everything that\r\n     humanity has to make it sweet and hopeful. Women have moral\r\n     sentiments and they want to record them. That is the only\r\n     difference between voting and not voting. The national life is\r\n     the reflected life of the people. It is strong with their\r\n     strength and weak with their weakness.\r\n\r\nA letter was read to the convention by Miss Anthony from Miss Kitty\r\nReed, daughter of Speaker Thomas B. Reed, who had been with her father\r\nin California during the recent suffrage campaign. In referring to\r\nthis she said:\r\n\r\n     There and elsewhere the thinking women who opposed it used this\r\n     argument: There are too many people voting already; the practical\r\n     effect of woman suffrage would be an increase in the illiterate\r\n     vote, without a proportionate increase in the intelligent vote.\r\n     They were not in favor of it unless there could be an educational\r\n     qualification. In other words, they were opposed to woman\r\n     suffrage because they were opposed to universal suffrage. I have\r\n     always regarded universal suffrage as the foundation principle of\r\n     our government. If \"governments deriving their just powers from\r\n     the consent of the governed\" does not mean that, what can it\r\n     mean? So I tried to persuade these women of the truth of that\r\n     which I supposed had been settled about one hundred and\r\n     twenty-one years ago. It is necessary to make women believe that\r\n     suffrage is a natural right rather than a privilege; that, while\r\n     abstractly it seems well for an intelligent citizen to govern an\r\n     ignorant one, human nature is such that the intelligent will\r\n     govern selfishly and leave the ignorant no opportunity to\r\n     improve.\r\n\r\n     It seems to me that the worst obstacle we have to encounter now\r\n     is not the prejudice of men against women's voting, but a\r\n     misunderstanding on the part of women of the real meaning of\r\n     government by the people. This may be ancient history to you, but\r\n     it impressed me deeply while I was in California and that is why\r\n     I write it. Of course there are many women who do not think. When\r\n     they hear woman suffrage spoken of, they go to their husbands and\r\n     ask them what they think about it, and their husbands tell them\r\n     that they are too good to vote, and those women are content. It\r\n     does not occur to them to ask why, if they are too pure and good\r\n     to vote, they are not excused from obeying the laws and paying\r\n     taxes.\r\n\r\nThe report of the first year's work done at national headquarters was\r\nvery satisfactory. In regard to the Press it contained the following:\r\n\r\n     The year 1896 has seen the beginning of an effort by our National\r\n     Association to use systematically the mighty lever of the public\r\n     press in behalf of our work. We have sent out in regular weekly\r\n     issues since March hundreds of copies of good equal suffrage\r\n     articles. These go into the hands of Press Committees in\r\n     forty-one States, and now between six and seven hundred papers\r\n     publish them each week. Of forty-one different articles by about\r\n     thirty different writers, nearly 25,000 copies have been\r\n     distributed to newspapers. These articles reach, in local papers,\r\n     not less than one million readers weekly.\r\n\r\n     We have taken charge of the National Suffrage Bulletin which is\r\n     edited by the chairman of the organization committee, have had it\r\n     printed in Philadelphia and mailed from the headquarters. In the\r\n     past twelve months there have been wrapped and sent out\r\n     separately 17,700 copies of the Bulletin. A portion of the\r\n     expenses has been defrayed by special contributions of $900 of\r\n     the $1,000 given to Miss Anthony by Mrs. Southworth, and $400\r\n     through the New York State Association, from the bequest of Mrs.\r\n     Eliza J. Clapp of Rochester to Miss Anthony.\r\n\r\nMr. Blackwell, as usual, reported for the Committee on Presidential\r\nSuffrage, suggesting a form of petition as follows:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The Constitution of the United States, the supreme law\r\n     of the land, expressly confers upon the Legislature of every\r\n     State the sole and exclusive right to appoint or to delegate the\r\n     appointment of presidential electors, in article II, section 1,\r\n     paragraph 2, as follows: \"Each State shall appoint in such manner\r\n     as the Legislature thereof may direct a number of electors equal\r\n     to the whole number of Senators and Representatives to which the\r\n     State may be entitled in the Congress;\" and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, In some of the States said appointment has been\r\n     repeatedly made by the Legislature; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Women equally with men are citizens of this State and of\r\n     the United States; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _The undersigned_, citizens of the State of ----, 21 years of age\r\n     and upwards, respectfully petition your honorable bodies so to\r\n     amend the election laws as to enable women to vote in the\r\n     appointment of presidential electors.\r\n\r\nThe report of the treasurer, Mrs. Upton, showed that the receipts had\r\nrisen to $11,825 during the year just passed. It ended thus: \"In\r\nclosing this report the treasurer would like to say that no one person\r\nhas ever been to the treasury what Miss Anthony has been and is. Every\r\ndollar given to her for any purpose whatever, she feels belongs to the\r\nwork and is most happy when she turns it in. On the other hand the\r\nassociation does very little for her. She pays her own traveling\r\nexpenses and her own clerk hire. It is to be hoped that this is the\r\nlast year we may be so neglectful in this direction.\"\r\n\r\nThe Congressional Committee, Mrs. Ellen Powell Thompson, acting\r\nchairman, reported as a part of the work done: \"To still further\r\nadvance the matter we determined to address a letter to each member of\r\nthe House and Senate, asking his opinion on the proposed amendment to\r\nenfranchise women. At least three-fourths of these letters were\r\npromptly answered in most gracious terms, and in many of them hearty\r\nsympathy with the purpose of the amendment was expressed. Not a small\r\nnumber declared they were ready to vote for the amendment when\r\nopportunity should be given.\"\r\n\r\nAmong the State reports those of California, by Mrs. Ellen Clark\r\nSargent, and of Idaho, by Mrs. Eunice Pond Athey, were of special\r\ninterest, as they contained an epitomized history of the recent\r\ncampaigns in these States. It was decided that there should be a\r\nspecial effort to make the next annual meeting a noteworthy affair, as\r\nit would celebrate the Fiftieth Anniversary of the First Woman's\r\nRights Convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XVIII.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL-AMERICAN CONVENTION OF 1898.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thirtieth annual convention of the suffrage association took place\r\nin the Columbia Theatre, Washington, D. C., Feb. 13-19, 1898, and\r\ncelebrated the Fiftieth Anniversary of the First Woman's Rights\r\nConvention.[112] In the center of the stage was an old-fashioned,\r\nround mahogany table, draped with the Stars and Stripes and the famous\r\nsilk suffrage flag with its four golden stars. In her opening address\r\nthe president, Miss Susan B. Anthony, said: \"On this table the\r\noriginal Declaration of Rights for Women was written at the home of\r\nthe well-known McClintock family in Waterloo, N. Y., just half a\r\ncentury ago. Around it gathered those immortal four, Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton, Lucretia Mott, Martha C. Wright and Mary Ann McClintock, to\r\nformulate the grievances of women. They did not dare to sign their\r\nnames but published the Call for their convention anonymously.[113] We\r\nhave had that remarkable document printed for distribution here, and\r\nyou will notice that those demands which were ridiculed and denounced\r\nfrom one end of the country to the other, all have now been conceded\r\nbut the suffrage, and that in four States.\"\r\n\r\nThis convention was the largest in number of delegates and States\r\nrepresented of any in the history of the association, 154 being in\r\nattendance and all but four of the States and Territories represented.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Anna Howard Shaw devoted the most of her vice-president's\r\nreport to an account of the work to secure a suffrage amendment from\r\nthe Legislature which was being done in Iowa, where she had been\r\nspending considerable time. The report on Press Work by the chairman,\r\nMiss Jessie J. Cassidy, stated that 30,000 suffrage articles had been\r\nsent from headquarters to the various newspapers of the country and\r\nthe number willing to accept these was constantly increasing. The\r\nheadquarters had been removed from Philadelphia to New York City\r\nduring the year and united with the organization office. The Committee\r\non Course of Study, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman, reported that\r\nduring the past three years they had published 25,000 books and\r\npamphlets, purchased from publishers 3,100 and had 9,000 contributed.\r\nThe treasurer, Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, announced the receipts of\r\nthe past year to be $14,055. Bequests had been received of $500 by the\r\nwill of Mrs. Eliza Murphy of New Jersey, and $500 from Mrs. A. Viola\r\nNeblett of South Carolina.\r\n\r\nThe report of the Organization Committee, Mrs. Chapman Catt, chairman,\r\nshowed a large amount of work done in Iowa, Illinois, South Dakota and\r\nthe Southern States, the writing of 10,000 letters, the holding of\r\n1,000 public meetings under the auspices of this committee. It closed\r\nby saying:\r\n\r\n     The chief obstacle to organization is not found in societies\r\n     opposed to the extension of suffrage to woman, nor in ignorance,\r\n     nor in conservatism; it is to be found in that large body of\r\n     suffragists who believe that the franchise will come, but that it\r\n     will come in some unaccountable way without effort or concern on\r\n     their part. It is to be found in the hopeless, faithless,\r\n     lifeless members of our own organization. They are at times the\r\n     officers of local clubs, and the clubs die on their hands; in\r\n     State executive committees, and there, appalled by the magnitude\r\n     of the undertaking, they decide that organization is impossible\r\n     because there is no money, and they make no effort to secure\r\n     funds. They are in our national body, ready to find fault with\r\n     plans and results and to criticise the conscientious efforts of\r\n     those who are struggling to accomplish good--yet they are never\r\n     ready to propose more helpful methods. In short, we find them\r\n     everywhere, doing practically nothing themselves, but \"throwing\r\n     cold water\" upon every effort inaugurated by others. \"It can not\r\n     be done\" is their motto, and by it they constantly discourage the\r\n     hopeful and extract all enthusiasm from new workers. Judging from\r\n     the intimate knowledge of the condition of our association gained\r\n     in the last three years, I am free to say that these are our most\r\n     effective opponents to-day, and, without question, the best\r\n     result of the three years' work is the gradual strengthening of\r\n     belief in the possibility of organization.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sallie Clay Bennett, chairman, presented the report on Federal\r\nSuffrage;[114] Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake, chairman, on Legislation;\r\nand Miss Laura Clay on the Suffrage Convocation at the Tennessee\r\nExposition the preceding year. The Plan of Work, offered by the\r\nchairman, Mrs. Mariana W. Chapman, and adopted, represented the best\r\nresult of many years' experience and exemplified the aims and methods\r\nof the association. The old board of officers was almost unanimously\r\nre-elected.\r\n\r\nThe afternoon Work Conferences, to exchange ideas as to methods for\r\norganizing, raising funds, etc., which met in a small hall, aroused so\r\nmuch interest and attracted so many people that it was necessary to\r\ntransfer them to the large auditorium. The Resolutions Committee\r\npresented by its chairman, Mrs. Ida Husted Harper, a brief summary of\r\nthe results already accomplished and the rights yet to be secured, in\r\npart as follows:\r\n\r\n     The National-American Woman Suffrage Association, at this its\r\n     thirtieth annual meeting, celebrates the semi-centennial\r\n     anniversary of the first Woman's Rights Convention, held in 1848\r\n     in Seneca Falls, N. Y., and reaffirms every principle then and\r\n     there enunciated. We count the gains of fifty years. Woman's\r\n     position revolutionized in the home, in society, in the church\r\n     and in the State; public sentiment changed, customs modified,\r\n     industries opened, co-education established, laws amended,\r\n     economic independence partially secured, and equal suffrage a\r\n     recognized subject of legislation. Fifty years ago women voted\r\n     nowhere in the world; to-day Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Idaho\r\n     have established equal suffrage for women, and have already in\r\n     the Congress of the United States eight Senators and seven\r\n     Representatives with women constituents. Kansas has granted women\r\n     Municipal Suffrage, and twenty-three other States have made women\r\n     voters in school elections. This movement is not confined to the\r\n     United States; in Great Britain and her colonies women now have\r\n     Municipal and County Suffrage, while New Zealand and South\r\n     Australia have abolished all political distinctions of sex.\r\n     Therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we hereby express our profound appreciation of\r\n     the prophetic vision, advanced thought and moral courage of the\r\n     pioneers in this movement for equality of rights, and our sincere\r\n     gratitude for their half century of toil and endurance to secure\r\n     for women the privileges they now enjoy, and to make the way\r\n     easier for those who are to complete the work. We, their\r\n     successors, a thousandfold multiplied, stand pledged to unceasing\r\n     effort until women have all the rights and privileges which\r\n     belong equally to every citizen of a republic.\r\n\r\n     That in every State we demand for women citizens equality with\r\n     male citizens in the exercise of the elective franchise, upon\r\n     such terms and conditions as the men impose upon themselves.\r\n\r\n     That we appeal to Congress to submit a Sixteenth Amendment to the\r\n     United States Constitution, thereby enabling the citizens of each\r\n     State to carry this question of woman suffrage before its\r\n     Legislature for settlement.\r\n\r\n     That we will aid, so far as practicable, every State campaign for\r\n     woman suffrage; but we urgently recommend our auxiliary State\r\n     societies to effect thorough county organizations before\r\n     petitioning their Legislatures for a State constitutional\r\n     amendment.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The good results of woman suffrage in Wyoming since 1869\r\n     have caused its adoption successively by the three adjoining\r\n     States; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we earnestly request the citizens of these four\r\n     free States to make a special effort to secure the franchise for\r\n     women in the States contiguous to their own.\r\n\r\n     That we demand for mothers equal custody and control of their\r\n     minor children, and for wives and widows an equal use and\r\n     inheritance of property.\r\n\r\n     That we ask for an equal representation of women on all boards of\r\n     education and health, of public schools and colleges, and in the\r\n     management of all public institutions; and for their employment\r\n     as physicians for women and children in all hospitals and\r\n     asylums, and as police matrons and guards in all prisons and\r\n     reformatories.\r\n\r\n     That this Association limits its efforts exclusively to securing\r\n     equal rights for women, and it appeals for co-operation to the\r\n     whole American people.\r\n\r\nMiss Alice Stone Blackwell, Mrs. Ida Porter Boyer and Mrs. Harper were\r\nappointed fraternal delegates to the Woman's Press Association, in\r\nsession at this time in Washington.\r\n\r\nA beautiful feature of this occasion was the luncheon given by Mrs.\r\nJohn R. McLean to Miss Anthony on her seventy-eighth birthday,\r\nFebruary 15, attended by thirty-six of the most distinguished ladies\r\nin the national capital, and followed by a reception to the members of\r\nthe convention. Mrs. McLean was assisted in receiving by Miss Anthony\r\nand Mrs. Ulysses S. Grant. Seventy-eight wax tapers burned upon the\r\nbirthday cake, which was three feet in diameter and decorated with\r\nflowers. It was presented to Miss Anthony, who carried it in triumph\r\nto the convention in Columbia Theatre, where it was cut into slices\r\nthat were sold as souvenirs and realized about $120, which she donated\r\nto the cause.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, at the age of eighty-two, sent two papers\r\nfor this fiftieth anniversary, one for the congressional hearing, on\r\nThe Significance of the Ballot; the other, Our Defeats and our\r\nTriumphs, was read to the convention by Mrs. Colby. Both displayed\r\nall the old-time vigor of thought and beauty of expression. The\r\nlatter, filled with interesting reminiscence, closed with these words:\r\n\r\n     Another generation has now enlisted for a long or short campaign.\r\n     What, say they, shall we do to hasten the work? I answer, the\r\n     pioneers have brought you through the wilderness in sight of the\r\n     promised land; now, with active, aggressive warfare, take\r\n     possession. Instead of rehearsing the old arguments which have\r\n     done duty fifty years, make a brave attack on every obstacle\r\n     which stands in your way.... Lord Brougham said: \"The laws for\r\n     women [in England and America] are a disgrace to the civilization\r\n     of the nineteenth century.\" The women in every State should watch\r\n     their law-makers, and any bill invidious to their interests\r\n     should be promptly denounced, and with such vehemence and\r\n     indignation as to agitate the whole community....\r\n\r\n     There is no merit in simply occupying the ground which others\r\n     have conquered. There are new fields for conquest and more\r\n     enemies to meet. Whatever affects woman's freedom, growth and\r\n     development affords legitimate subject for discussion here....\r\n     Some of our opponents think woman would be a dangerous element in\r\n     politics and destroy the secular nature of our Government. I\r\n     would have a resolution on that point discussed freely, and show\r\n     liberal thinkers that we have a large number in our association\r\n     as desirous to preserve the secular nature of our Government as\r\n     they themselves can possibly be.... When educated women, teachers\r\n     in all our schools, professors in our colleges, are governed by\r\n     rulers, foreign and native, who can neither read nor write, I\r\n     would have this association discuss and pass a resolution in\r\n     favor of \"educated suffrage.\" ...\r\n\r\n     The object of our organization is to secure equality and freedom\r\n     for woman: First, in the State, which is denied when she is not\r\n     permitted to exercise the right of suffrage; second, in the\r\n     Church, which is denied when she has no voice in its councils,\r\n     creeds and discipline, or in the choice of its ministers, elders\r\n     and deacons; third, in the Home, where the State makes the\r\n     husband's authority absolute, the wife a subject, where the\r\n     mother is robbed of the guardianship of her own child, and where\r\n     the joint earnings belong solely to the husband.\r\n\r\n     ....Let this generation pay its debt to the past by continuing\r\n     this great work until the last vestige of woman's subjection\r\n     shall be erased from our creeds and codes and constitutions. Then\r\n     the united thought of man and woman will inaugurate a pure\r\n     religion, a just government, a happy home and a civilization in\r\n     which ignorance, poverty and crime will exist no more. They who\r\n     watch behold already the dawn of a new day.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell (N. Y.), the first woman to\r\ngraduate in theology and be ordained, delineated The Changing Phases\r\nof Opposition, pointing out that when the first Woman's Rights\r\nConvention was held the general tone of the press was shown in that\r\nnewspaper which said: \"This bolt is the most shocking and unnatural\r\nincident ever recorded in the history of humanity; if these demands\r\nwere effected, it would set the world by the ears, make confusion\r\nworse confounded, demoralize and degrade from their high sphere and\r\nnoble destiny women of all respectable and useful classes, and prove a\r\nmonstrous injury to all mankind.\" Yet this present convention was\r\ncelebrating the granting of all those demands except the suffrage and\r\nnot one of the predicted evils had come to pass. The direful\r\nprophecies of the early days were taken up, one by one, and their\r\nutter absurdity pointed out in the light of experience. Now all of\r\nthose ancient, stereotyped objections were concentrated against\r\ngranting the suffrage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Virginia D. Young (S. C.) delighted the audience with one of her\r\ncharacteristic addresses. Prof. Frances Stewart Mosher, of Hillsdale\r\nCollege (Mich.), gave an exhaustive review of the great increase and\r\nvalue of Woman's Work in Church Philanthropies. Mrs. May Wright Sewall\r\n(Ind.) demonstrated the wonderful Progress of Women in Education. The\r\nNew Education possessed the charm of novelty in being presented by\r\nMiss Grace Espy Patton, State Superintendent of Public Instruction in\r\nColorado, a lady so delicate and dainty that, when Miss Anthony led\r\nher forward and said, \"It has always been charged that voting and\r\nofficeholding will make women coarse and unwomanly; now look at her!\"\r\nthe audience responded with an ovation.\r\n\r\nMiss Belle Kearney (Miss.) discussed Social Changes in the South,\r\ndepicting in a rapid, magnetic manner, interspersed with flashes of\r\nwit, the evolution of the Southern woman and the revolution in customs\r\nand privileges which must inevitably lead up to political rights. Mrs.\r\nMary Seymour Howell (N. Y.) gave an eloquent review of the splendid\r\nservices of Women in Philanthropy.\r\n\r\nAt the memorial services Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby (D. C.) offered the\r\nfollowing resolutions:\r\n\r\n     It is fitting in this commemorative celebration to pause a moment\r\n     to place a laurel in memory's chaplet for those to whom it was\r\n     given to be the earliest to voice the demand that woman should be\r\n     allowed to enter into the sacred heritage of liberty, as one\r\n     made equally with man in the image of the Creator and divinely\r\n     appointed to co-sovereignty over the earth. To name them here is\r\n     to recognize their presence with us in spirit and to invoke their\r\n     benediction upon this generation which, entering into the results\r\n     of their labors, must carry them forward to full fruition.\r\n\r\n     Lucretia Mott always will be revered as one of those who\r\n     conceived the idea of a convention to make an organized demand\r\n     for justice to women. She became a Quaker preacher in 1818 at the\r\n     age of twenty-five, and the last suffrage convention she attended\r\n     was in her eighty-sixth year. Her motto, \"Truth for authority and\r\n     not authority for truth,\" is still the tocsin of reform. Sarah\r\n     Pugh, the lovely Quaker, was ever her close friend and helper.\r\n\r\n     Frances Wright, a noble Scotchwoman, a friend of General\r\n     Lafayette, early imbibed a love for freedom and a knowledge of\r\n     the principles on which it is based. In this the land of her\r\n     adoption she was the first woman to lecture on political\r\n     subjects, in 1826.\r\n\r\n     Ernestine L. Rose, the beautiful Polish patriot, sent the first\r\n     petition to the New York Legislature to give a married woman the\r\n     right to hold real estate in her own name. This was in 1836, and\r\n     she continued the work of securing signatures until 1848, when\r\n     the bill was passed. She was a matchless orator and lectured on\r\n     woman suffrage for nearly fifty years.\r\n\r\n     Lucy Stone's voice pleaded the wide continent over for justice\r\n     for her sex. Her life-long devotion to the woman suffrage cause\r\n     was idealized by the companionship and assistance of her husband,\r\n     Henry B. Blackwell, the one man in this nation who under any and\r\n     all circumstances has made woman's cause his chief consideration.\r\n     Her first lecture on woman's rights was given in 1847, the year\r\n     of her graduation at Oberlin College, and her life work was\r\n     epitomized in her dying words, \"Make the world better.\"\r\n\r\n     Martha C. Wright, Jane Hunt and Mary Ann McClintock were three of\r\n     those noble women who issued the call for the Seneca Falls\r\n     Convention, and were ever ready for service.\r\n\r\n     Paulina Wright Davis, who called the first National Convention in\r\n     1850 and presided over its twentieth celebration in 1870, was one\r\n     of the moving spirits of the work for more than twenty-five\r\n     years. Assisted by Caroline H. Dall, she edited the _Una_,\r\n     founded in 1853, the first distinctively woman suffrage paper.\r\n\r\n     Frances Dana Gage, better known by her pen-name, \"Aunt Fanny,\"\r\n     was farmer, editor, lecturer and worker in the Sanitary\r\n     Commission. Of her eight children six were stalwart sons, and she\r\n     used to boast that she was the mother of thirty-six feet of boys.\r\n     She was a pillar of strength to the movement in early days.\r\n\r\n     Clarina Howard Nichols is associated with the seed-sowing in\r\n     Vermont, in Wisconsin and especially in Kansas, where her labors\r\n     with the first constitutional convention, in 1859, engrafted in\r\n     organic law many rights for women which were obtained elsewhere,\r\n     if at all, only by slow and difficult legislative changes. Susan\r\n     E. Wattles led the Kansas campaign of 1859 with Mrs. Nichols.\r\n\r\n     Emily Robinson of Salem, Ohio, was one of the chief movers in\r\n     the second Woman's Rights Convention, and this was held in her\r\n     own town in 1850. From that time until the present year she has\r\n     been unfaltering in her devotion.\r\n\r\n     Dr. Susan A. Edson, who was graduated in medicine in 1854, was a\r\n     fellow-pioneer in the District of Columbia with Dr. Caroline B.\r\n     Winslow, whose death preceded hers by about one year. She was one\r\n     of the most distinguished army nurses and the friend and faithful\r\n     attendant of President Garfield. For many years she was the\r\n     president of the District Woman Suffrage Association. Among the\r\n     earlier woman physicians who espoused the cause were Dr. Harriot\r\n     K. Hunt, Dr. Mary B. Jackson, Dr. Ann Preston, one of the\r\n     founders and physicians of the Woman's Hospital of Philadelphia,\r\n     and Dr. Clemence S. Lozier, a founder and physician of the New\r\n     York Medical College for Women.\r\n\r\n     Sarah Helen Whitman was the first literary woman of reputation\r\n     who gave her name to the movement, which later counted among its\r\n     warmest friends Lydia Maria Child, Alice and Phoebe Cary and Mary\r\n     Clemmer.\r\n\r\n     Amalia B. Post of Cheyenne, to whom the enfranchisement of the\r\n     women of Wyoming was largely due, was ready, as she often said,\r\n     at the first tap of the drum at Seneca Falls. She occupied the\r\n     place of honor by the side of the Governor on that proud day when\r\n     the admission of Wyoming as a State was celebrated.\r\n\r\n     Josephine S. Griffing, organizer of the Freedman's Bureau; Amelia\r\n     Bloomer, editor of the _Lily_, the first temperance and woman's\r\n     rights paper; Mary Grew, for twenty-three years president of the\r\n     Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association; Myra Bradwell, the first\r\n     woman to enter the ranks of legal journalism; Virginia L. Minor,\r\n     the dove with the eagle's heart, who took to the U. S. Supreme\r\n     Court her suit against the Missouri officials for refusing her\r\n     vote--all these, and many more who might be added, form the noble\r\n     galaxy who brought to the cause of woman's liberty rare personal\r\n     beauty, social gifts, intellectual culture, and the\r\n     all-compelling eloquence of earnestness and sincerity.\r\n\r\n     Albert O. Willcox of New York, whose eighty-seven years were\r\n     filled with valuable work for reforms, was drawn to the\r\n     conviction that women should have a share in the Government by a\r\n     sermon preached by Lucretia Mott in 1831, and from that time\r\n     declared himself publicly for the movement and was its life-long\r\n     supporter.\r\n\r\n     James G. Clark, the sweet-souled troubadour of reform, sang for\r\n     woman's freedom in suffrage conventions all over the land.\r\n\r\n     Joseph N. Dolph was always to be counted on to further the\r\n     political emancipation of women, both in his own State of Oregon\r\n     and in the U. S. Senate, of which he was long an honored member.\r\n\r\n     To name the men who have been counselors and friends of the woman\r\n     suffrage movement is to name the greatest poets, preachers and\r\n     statesmen of the last half century. Wherever there has been a\r\n     woman strong enough to demand her rights there has been a man\r\n     generous and just enough to second her. Surely we may say that\r\n     \"the spirits of just men made perfect\" are our strength and our\r\n     inspiration.\r\n\r\n     No less entitled to remembrance and gratitude are the unnamed\r\n     multitude who have helped the onward march of freedom by standing\r\n     for the truth that was revealed to them. Whether they pass away\r\n     in the beauty of youth, the strength of maturity or the glory of\r\n     old age, they who have given to the world one impulse on the\r\n     upward path to freedom and to light are not dead. They live here\r\n     in the life of all good things, and, because of strength gained\r\n     in earthly activity, have strength to perfect in other spheres\r\n     what here they but dreamed of.\r\n\r\nThe _Woman's Tribune_ thus described one scene of the convention:\r\n\r\n     The opening address of Wednesday evening was by Mrs. Isabella\r\n     Beecher Hooker (Conn.) on United States Citizenship. She was not\r\n     heard distinctly and the audience was very fidgety. Miss Anthony\r\n     came forward and told them they ought to be perfectly satisfied\r\n     just to sit still and look at Mrs. Hooker. She is always a\r\n     commanding presence on the stage, and on this evening, impressed\r\n     with the deep significance of the event, and clad in silver gray,\r\n     which harmonized beautifully with her whitening curls, she was a\r\n     picture which would delight an artist. But notwithstanding Miss\r\n     Anthony's admonition, the audience really wanted to hear as well\r\n     as to see. Mrs. Hooker realizing this at last said impatiently,\r\n     \"I never could give a written speech, but Susan insisted that I\r\n     must this time,\" and, discarding her manuscript, she spoke\r\n     clearly and forcibly with her old-time power. A portion of her\r\n     address was a graphic recital of Miss Anthony's trial for illegal\r\n     voting in 1872.\r\n\r\n     When Mrs. Hooker's time had expired Miss Anthony rose and put her\r\n     arm around her, and thus these striking figures, representing the\r\n     opposite poles of the woman suffrage force, made a tableau which\r\n     will never pass from the mental vision of those who witnessed it.\r\n     At the close of her remarks Mrs. Hooker threw her arms around\r\n     Miss Anthony and kissed her. The latter, more moved than was her\r\n     wont, gave vent to that strong feeling of the injustice of\r\n     woman's disfranchisement which is ever present with her, and\r\n     exclaimed: \"To think that such a woman, belonging by birth and\r\n     marriage to the most distinguished families in our country's\r\n     history, should be held as a subject and have set over her all\r\n     classes of men, with the prospect of there being added to her\r\n     rulers the Cubans and the Sandwich Island Kanakas. Shame on a\r\n     government that permits such an outrage!\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Caroline Hallowell Miller (Md.), one of the first suffrage\r\nadvocates south of Mason and Dixon's line, gave A Glimpse of the Past\r\nand Present. Dr. Clara Marshall, Dean of the Woman's Medical College\r\nof Pennsylvania, presented the history of Fifty Years in Medicine. She\r\nrelated in a graphic manner the struggle of women to gain admission\r\nto the colleges, the embarrassments they suffered, the obstacles they\r\nwere obliged to overcome, reading from published reports the hostile\r\ndemonstrations of the male students. In closing she bore testimony to\r\nthe encouragement and assistance rendered by those men who were\r\nbroad-minded and generous enough to recognize the rights of women in\r\nthis profession and help secure them. The Ministry of Religion as a\r\nCalling for Women was the subject of an able and interesting address\r\nby the Rev. Florence Buck of Unity Church, Cleveland, Ohio. Mrs. Ella\r\nKnowles Haskell, assistant attorney-general of Montana, spoke on Women\r\nin the Legal Profession, giving many incidents of the practice of law\r\nin the far West.\r\n\r\nSamuel J. Barrows, member of Congress from Massachusetts, was called\r\nfrom the audience by Miss Anthony, and closed his brief remarks by\r\nsaying: \"I believe in woman suffrage; it has in it the elements of\r\njustice which entitle it to every man's support, and we all ought to\r\nhelp secure it.\" A leading feature of the program was the speech of\r\nAugust W. Machen, head of the free delivery division of the national\r\npost office, on Women in the Departmental Service of the United\r\nStates. He gave the history of their employment by the government,\r\ndeclared they had raised the standard of work and testified to their\r\nefficiency and faithfulness.\r\n\r\nThe Civil Rights of Women were ably discussed by the Rev. Frederick A.\r\nHinckley of the Second Unitarian Church, Philadelphia, who reviewed\r\nthe existing laws and pointed out the changes in favor of women. In\r\nregard to the prevalence of divorce he said: \"There is a large class\r\nof our fellow-citizens who greatly misinterpret, in my opinion, the\r\nsignificance of the increase in the number of divorces. No one would\r\ncounsel more earnestly than I, patience and consideration and every\r\nreasonable effort on the part of people once married to live together.\r\nBut I can not dispute the proposition, nor do I believe any one can\r\ndispute it, that in the great process of evolution divorce is an\r\nindication of growing independence and self-respect in women, a\r\nproclamation that marriage must be the union of self-respecting and\r\nmutually respected equals, and that in the ideal home of the future\r\nthat hideous thing, the subjugation of woman, is to be unknown.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch (Ills.) discussed The Economic Status\r\nof Women. Madame Clara Neymann (N. Y.) read a philosophical paper on\r\nMarriage in the Light of Woman's Freedom. The Progress of Colored\r\nWomen was pictured in an impassioned address by Mrs. Mary Church\r\nTerrell, president of the National Association of Colored Women. She\r\nreceived numerous floral tributes at its close. Mrs. Emmy C. Evald of\r\nChicago, with an attractive foreign enthusiasm, told of the work of\r\nSwedish women in their own country and in the United States. Mrs.\r\nLillie Devereux Blake (N. Y.) with clever satire and amidst laughter\r\nand applause, considered Women in Municipalities.\r\n\r\nThe Pioneers' Evening was one of great interest, when Miss Anthony\r\nmarshalled her hosts and made \"the roll-call of the years.\" As each\r\ndecade was called, beginning with 1848, those who began the suffrage\r\nwork at that time rose on the stage and in all parts of the house and\r\nremained standing. Not one was there who was present at the original\r\nSeneca Falls Convention, but it had held an adjourned meeting at\r\nRochester, three weeks later, and Miss Anthony's sister, Mary S.,\r\nresponded as having attended then and signed the Declaration of\r\nRights. The daughters of Mrs. Martha C. Wright, who called this\r\nconvention--Mrs. Eliza Wright Osborne and Mrs. Wm. Lloyd Garrison--and\r\nalso Mrs. Millie Burtis Logan, whose mother, Miss Anthony's cousin,\r\nserved as its secretary, were introduced to the audience. The children\r\nof Frederick Douglass, who had spoken at both meetings, were present\r\nand should have come forward with this group. The Rev. Antoinette\r\nBrown Blackwell stated that she had spoken in favor of woman's rights\r\nin 1846. Among the earliest of the pioneers present were John W.\r\nHutchinson, the last of that famous family of singers; Henry B.\r\nBlackwell, Mrs. Helen Philleo Jenkins (Mich.), Miss Sarah Wall (Mass.)\r\nand Mrs. Hooker. Many of those who arose made brief remarks and the\r\noccasion was one which will not be forgotten by those who witnessed\r\nit.\r\n\r\nAmong the letters received from the many pioneers still living was one\r\nfrom Mrs. Abigail Bush, now eighty-eight years old and residing in\r\nCalifornia, who presided over the Rochester meeting, Aug. 2, 1848. It\r\nis especially interesting as showing that even so advanced women as\r\nLucretia Mott and Mrs. Stanton, although they dared call such a\r\nmeeting, were yet so conservative as to object to a woman's presiding\r\nover it:\r\n\r\n     TO SUSAN B. ANTHONY, GREETING: You will bear me witness that the\r\n     state of society is very different from what it was fifty years\r\n     ago, when I presided at the first Woman's Rights Convention. I\r\n     had not been able to meet in council at all with the friends\r\n     until I met them in the hall as the congregation was gathering,\r\n     and then fell into the hands of those who urged me to take part\r\n     with the opposers of a woman serving, as the party had with them\r\n     a fine-looking man to preside at all of their meetings, James\r\n     Mott, who had presided at Seneca Falls. Afterward I fell in with\r\n     the old friends, Amy Post, Rhoda de Garmo and Sarah Fish, who at\r\n     once commenced labors with me to prove that the hour had come\r\n     when a woman should preside, and led me into the church. Amy\r\n     proposed my name as president; I was accepted at once, and from\r\n     that hour I seemed endowed as from on high to serve.\r\n\r\n     It was a two days' meeting with three sessions per day. On my\r\n     taking the chair, Lucretia Mott and Elizabeth Cady Stanton left\r\n     the platform and took their seats in the audience, but it did not\r\n     move me from performing all my duties, and at the close of the\r\n     meeting Lucretia Mott came forward, folded me tenderly in her\r\n     arms and thanked me for presiding. That settled the question of\r\n     men's presiding at a woman's convention. From that day to this,\r\n     in all the walks of life, I have been faithful in asserting that\r\n     there should be \"no taxation without representation.\" It has\r\n     seemed long in coming, but I think the time draws near when woman\r\n     will be acknowledged as equal with man. Heaven grant the day to\r\n     dawn soon!\r\n\r\nMrs. Catharine A. F. Stebbins (Mich.), who had attended the Seneca\r\nFalls Convention and signed the Declaration of Rights, sent an\r\ninteresting descriptive letter. Mrs. Lucinda H. Stone (Mich.), the\r\nmother of women's clubs and a pioneer on educational lines, wrote:\r\n\r\n     You wanted I should write you any anecdotes of early interest in\r\n     woman suffrage. The remembrance of Dr. Stone's waking up to that\r\n     subject has come to me, and I have thought I would tell you about\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     It was some time in the forties that he was requested to deliver\r\n     a Fourth of July oration in Kalamazoo. I can not tell the exact\r\n     year, but it was before I had ever heard of the Rochester\r\n     Convention, or of you or Mrs. Stanton, and he was looking up all\r\n     that he could find in the early history of our Declaration of\r\n     Independence, and the principles of Jefferson and the early\r\n     revolutionists. I remember his coming in one day (it must have\r\n     been before 1848), seeming very much absorbed in something that\r\n     he was thinking about. He threw down the book he had been\r\n     reading, and said to me: \"The time will come when women will\r\n     vote. Mark my words! We may not live to see it, we probably shall\r\n     not, but it will come. It is not a woman's right or a man's\r\n     right; it is a human right, and their voting is but a natural\r\n     process of evolution.\" ...\r\n\r\nMrs. Esther Wattles, who helped secure School Suffrage and equal\r\nproperty laws for women in the State constitution of Kansas in 1859,\r\nsent this message: \"My attention was first called to the injustice\r\ndone to women by a lecture given near Wilmington, Ohio, by John O.\r\nWattles in 1841. He devoted most of his time to lecturing on Woman's\r\nRights, The Sin of Slavery, The Temperance Reform and Peace. I heard\r\nhim on all these subjects, off and on, till 1844, when we were\r\nmarried.... Seventy-nine summers with their clouds and sunshine, make\r\nit fitting I should greet you by letter rather than personal presence.\r\nMay the cause never falter till the victory is won.\"\r\n\r\nMost of the letters were sent to Miss Anthony personally. Among these\r\nwere the following:\r\n\r\n     We, the members of the National Association of Woman\r\n     Stenographers, take great pleasure in extending congratulations\r\n     to you on the occasion of your seventy-eighth birthday, and hope\r\n     that the days of your years may still be many and happy. We also\r\n     desire to express our appreciation of and gratitude for the work\r\n     you have done in securing freedom and justice for women. As\r\n     business women we are better able to comprehend what you have\r\n     accomplished, especially for those who are bread-winners, and we\r\n     trust the time may soon come when we shall not be limited to\r\n     understanding what freedom is, but be able to act in accordance\r\n     with its principles.\r\n\r\n     THE NEVADA EQUAL SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION: Although we are young in\r\n     the ranks and few in number compared with the older States, yet\r\n     we are none the less loyal to the principles advocated and\r\n     established by the National Association. We are brave because we\r\n     draw inspiration from the thoughts and acts of that Spartan band\r\n     of suffragists of fifty years ago, who devoted the sunshine of\r\n     their lives and the energies of their philosophic minds to the\r\n     effort to obtain for womankind their inherent right to have a\r\n     voice in the Government which derives its just powers from the\r\n     consent of the governed.\r\n\r\n     ALFRED H. LOVE, president of the Universal Peace Union: From our\r\n     rooms in the east wing of Independence Hall, I send greetings to\r\n     you and your cause. Your cause is ours, and has been one of our\r\n     essential principles since our organization. Your success is a\r\n     triumph for peace.\r\n\r\n     MARY LOWE DICKINSON, secretary of the International Order of the\r\n     King's Daughters and Sons: I hope you will live to see the full\r\n     day for the cause whose dawn owed so much to your labors, and I\r\n     can ask nothing better for you than that you have \"the desire of\r\n     your heart,\" which I am sure will be the ballot for us all.\r\n\r\n     DR. ELIZABETH BLACKWELL, the first woman physician: Although I\r\n     can not respond in person to your very friendly invitation to be\r\n     a representative of \"the pioneers,\" yet I gladly send my hearty\r\n     greeting to you and to the other brave workers for the progress\r\n     of the race--a progress slow but inevitable. Amongst all its\r\n     steps I consider the admission of women to the medical profession\r\n     as the most important. Whilst thankfully recognizing the\r\n     wonderful accumulations of knowledge which generations of our\r\n     brethren have gathered together, our future women physicians will\r\n     rejoice to help in the construction of that noble temple of\r\n     medicine, whose foundation stone must be sympathetic justice.\r\n     Pray allow me to send my warm greeting to the Congress through\r\n     you.\r\n\r\nThere were messages and grateful recognition from so many societies\r\nand individuals in the United States that it would be impossible even\r\nto call them by name; also from the Dominion of Canada Suffrage Club,\r\nthrough Dr. Augusta Stowe Gullen; the National Union of Women's\r\nSuffrage Societies in Great Britain, with individual letters from Lady\r\nAberdeen, Mrs. Millicent Garrett Fawcett, Mrs. Priscilla Bright\r\nMcLaren and others; on behalf of the Swedish Frederika Bremer\r\nFörbundet, by Carl Lindhagen; on behalf of Finnish women by Baroness\r\nAlexandra Gripenberg; on behalf of German women by Frau Hanna\r\nBieber-Bohm, president of the National Council of Women; on behalf of\r\nthe Woman Suffrage Society of Holland by its secretary, Margarethe\r\nGallé; from the Norwegian Woman Suffrage Club; from the Verein\r\nJugendschutz of Berlin, and from the Union to Promote Woman's Rights\r\nin Finland.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable scenes of the closing evening made a deep impression\r\nupon the large audience. After fifty years of effort to overcome the\r\nmost stubborn and deeply-rooted prejudices of the ages, the results\r\nwere beginning to appear. Among the speakers were a woman State\r\nsenator from Utah, Mrs. Martha Hughes Cannon; a woman member of the\r\nColorado Legislature, Mrs. Martha A. B. Conine; a woman State\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction, Miss Estelle Reel of Wyoming; U.\r\nS. Senators Henry M. Teller of Colorado, and Frank J. Cannon of Utah,\r\nStates where women have full suffrage; Representative John F. Shafroth\r\nof Colorado--and in the center of this distinguished group, Susan B.\r\nAnthony, receiving the fruits of her half century of toil and\r\nhardship.\r\n\r\n     MISS REEL: I want to tell you a little about our work in\r\n     Wyoming, where women have been voting and holding office for\r\n     nearly thirty years, and where our people are convinced that it\r\n     has been of great benefit. Our home life there is as sacred and\r\n     sweet as anywhere else on the globe. Equal suffrage has been\r\n     tried and not found wanting. You may ask, What reforms has\r\n     Wyoming to show? We were the first State to adopt the Australian\r\n     ballot, and to accept a majority verdict of juries in civil\r\n     cases. We are noted for our humane treatment of criminals, our\r\n     care of the deserving poor and the education of our young. Child\r\n     labor is prohibited. The Supreme Court has just decided that\r\n     every voter must be able to read the Constitution in English. We\r\n     have night schools all over the State for those who can not\r\n     attend school by day. Equal suffrage was given to help protect\r\n     the home element, and the home vote is a great conservative\r\n     force. Woman suffrage means stable government, anchored in the\r\n     steadfast rock of American homes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Conine was commissioned as a delegate to the convention by Gov.\r\nAlva Adams of Colorado. She read the statement recently put forth,\r\ntestifying to the good results of equal suffrage and signed by the\r\nGovernor, three ex-Governors, all the State Senators and the\r\nRepresentatives in Congress, the Chief Justice and the Associate\r\nJustices of the Supreme Court, the Judges of the Court of Appeals, the\r\nJudges of the District Court, the Secretary of State, the State\r\ntreasurer, auditor, attorney-general, the mayor of Denver, the\r\npresidents of the State University and of Colorado College, the\r\npresident of the General Federation of Women's Clubs and the\r\npresidents of thirteen women's clubs, and said:\r\n\r\n     During the session of the Legislature last winter, there were\r\n     three women in the House. We met the other members upon terms of\r\n     absolute equality. No thought of incongruity or unfitness seems\r\n     to have arisen, and at the same time those little courtesies\r\n     which gentlemen instinctively pay to ladies were never omitted.\r\n     Each of the ladies was given a chairmanship, one of them that of\r\n     the Printing Committee, and the printing bill was lower by\r\n     thousands of dollars than for any previous session. The women\r\n     were as frequently called to the chair in Committee of the Whole\r\n     as were the men. One of them was placed upon the Judiciary\r\n     Committee at the request of its chairman. Every honorary\r\n     committee appointed during the session included one or more of\r\n     the ladies.\r\n\r\n     Our State Federation of Women's Clubs now numbers about 100,\r\n     representing a united membership of 4,000. They are largely\r\n     occupied in studying social and economic questions, earnestly\r\n     seeking for the best methods of educating their children,\r\n     reforming criminals, alleviating poverty and purifying the\r\n     ballot; in short, striving to make their city and their State a\r\n     cleaner, better home for their families. Their work receives\r\n     added encouragement from the knowledge that by their ballots\r\n     they may determine who shall make and administer the laws under\r\n     which their children must be reared. The home has always been\r\n     conceded to be the woman's kingdom. In the free States she has\r\n     but expanded the walls of that home, that she may afford to the\r\n     inmates, and also to those who unfortunately have no other home,\r\n     the same protection and loving care which was formerly limited to\r\n     the few short years of childhood passed beneath the parental\r\n     roof.\r\n\r\n     SENATOR TELLER: I want to indorse what has been said by the two\r\n     members from Colorado and Wyoming. The former is rather young as\r\n     a suffrage State, but we are living side by side with the latter,\r\n     where they have had equal suffrage for nearly thirty years. The\r\n     results of woman suffrage have proved entirely satisfactory--not\r\n     to every individual, but to the great mass of the people: I hear\r\n     it said in this city every day that if women are allowed to vote\r\n     the best women will not take part. I want to say to you that this\r\n     is a mistake. To my certain knowledge, the best women do take\r\n     part. When I went back to Colorado, after the granting of equal\r\n     suffrage, a prominent society woman, whom I had known for years,\r\n     telephoned me to come up and speak to the ladies at her house. I\r\n     found her big parlors full of representative women--the wives of\r\n     bankers, lawyers, preachers--society women. If you put any duty\r\n     upon women they are not going to shirk it. Those who feared the\r\n     responsibility are now as enthusiastic as those who had been\r\n     \"clamoring\" for it. In the past, women have had no object in\r\n     studying political questions; now they have, and they are taking\r\n     them up in their clubs. We find that women are less partisan than\r\n     men. Why? Because they generally have more conscience than men.\r\n     They will not vote for a dissolute and disreputable man who may\r\n     happen to force himself on a party ticket....\r\n\r\n     We are an intelligent community; we have long had a challenge to\r\n     our fellow-citizens to show any other city that has as large a\r\n     proportion of college graduates as Denver. Colorado people are\r\n     proud of equal suffrage. The area where it prevails spread last\r\n     year and took in Utah and Idaho. It will take in more neighboring\r\n     States. I predict that in ten years, instead of four suffrage\r\n     States, we shall have twice as many--perhaps three or four times\r\n     that number.\r\n\r\n     REPRESENTATIVE SHAFROTH: I want to say this, as coming from\r\n     Colorado: The experience we have had ought to demonstrate to\r\n     every one that woman suffrage is not only right but practical. It\r\n     tends to elevate. There is not a caucus now but is better\r\n     attended and by better people, and held in a better place. I have\r\n     seen the time when a political convention without a disturbance\r\n     and the drawing of weapons was rare. That time is past in\r\n     Colorado, and it is due to the presence of women. Every man now\r\n     shows that civility which makes him take off his hat and not\r\n     swear, and deport himself decently when ladies are present.\r\n     Instead of women's going to the polls corrupting them it has\r\n     purified the polls. Husband and wife go there together. No one\r\n     insults them. There are no drunken men there, nothing but what\r\n     is pleasant and decorous.\r\n\r\n     Woman is an independent element in politics. She has no\r\n     allegiance to any party. When a ticket is presented to her, she\r\n     asks, \"Are these good men?\" A man is apt to say, \"Well, this is a\r\n     bad ticket, but I must stand by my party.\" He wants to keep his\r\n     party record straight. She votes for the best man on the ticket.\r\n     That element is bound to result in good in any State.\r\n\r\n     People say they don't know how it will work; they are afraid of\r\n     it. Can it be that we distrust our mothers and sisters? We shall\r\n     never have the best possible government till women participate in\r\n     it.\r\n\r\n     SENATOR CANNON: No nation can exist half slave and half free. Ten\r\n     years before I was old enough to vote, my mother was a voter. I\r\n     learned at her knee to vote according to my conscience, and not\r\n     according to the dictation of the bosses. The strongest argument\r\n     for the suffrage of any class exists in behalf of womankind,\r\n     because women will not be bound by mere partisanship. If the\r\n     world is to be redeemed, it must be by the conscience of the\r\n     individual voter. The woman goes to the truth by instinct. Men\r\n     have to confer together and go down street and look through\r\n     glasses darkly. The woman stays at home and rocks the cradle, and\r\n     God tells her what to do. The suffrage never was abused by women\r\n     in Utah. During the seventeen years that they voted in the\r\n     Territory there was not a defalcation in any public office.\r\n\r\n     I believe in the republic. I believe that its destiny is to shed\r\n     light not only here, but all over the world. If we can trust\r\n     woman in the house to keep all pure and holy there, so that the\r\n     little ones may grow up right, surely we can trust her at the\r\n     ballot-box. When children learn political wisdom and truth from\r\n     their mother's lips, they will remember it and live up to it; for\r\n     those lessons are the longest remembered. When Senator Teller\r\n     withdrew from a political convention for conscience's sake, a man\r\n     said, commenting on his action: \"It is generally safe to stay\r\n     with your party.\" His wife said: \"And it is always safe to stay\r\n     with your principles.\"\r\n\r\nIn the midst of the convention came the sad news on February 17 of the\r\ndeath of Miss Frances E. Willard, president of the National Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union. Affectionate tributes were offered by Miss\r\nAnthony, Miss Shaw and other members; a telegram of sympathy was sent\r\nto her secretary and close companion, Miss Anna Gordon, by a rising\r\nvote, and the audience remained standing for a few moments in silent\r\nprayer. A large wreath of violets and Southern ivy, adorned with\r\nminiatures of Mrs. Stanton, Miss Anthony and other pioneer suffrage\r\nworkers was sent by the delegates to be laid on her coffin.\r\n\r\nThe congressional hearings on the morning of February 15, Miss\r\nAnthony's birthday, attracted crowds of people to the Capitol. The\r\nhearing before the Senate Committee was conducted by the Rev. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw, and considered The Philosophy of the Movement for Woman\r\nSuffrage. Only two members of the committee were present--James H.\r\nBerry of Arkansas, and George P. Wetmore of Rhode Island--but a number\r\nof other senators were interested listeners, and the large Marble Room\r\nwas crowded with delegates and spectators. The first paper, by Wm.\r\nLloyd Garrison (Mass.) considered The Nature of a Republican Form of\r\nGovernment:\r\n\r\n     The advocates of complete enfranchisement of women base their\r\n     demand upon the principles underlying all suffrage, rather than\r\n     upon the question of sex. If manhood suffrage is a mistake; if\r\n     voting is a privilege and not a right; if government does not\r\n     derive its just powers from the consent of the governed; if\r\n     Lincoln's aphorism that ours is a \"government of the people, for\r\n     the people and by the people\" is only a rhetorical generality,\r\n     then women have no case. If not, they see no reason why, as they\r\n     are governed, they should not have a voice in choosing their\r\n     rulers; why, as people, they are not covered by Lincoln's\r\n     definition. They feel naturally that their exclusion is unjust.\r\n\r\n     Woman suffragists are not unconscious of the glaring contrast\r\n     between declared principles and actual practice, and they venture\r\n     to believe that a professed self-government which deliberately\r\n     ignores its own axioms is tending to decadence. They are not\r\n     unmindful of the slow evolution of human government from earliest\r\n     history, beginning in force and greed, reaching through struggles\r\n     of blood, in the course of time, to the legislative stage where\r\n     differences are adjudicated by reason, and the sword reserved as\r\n     the last resort. This vantage ground has been gained only by a\r\n     recognition of the primal right of the people to be consulted in\r\n     regard to public affairs; and in proportion as this right has\r\n     been respected and the franchise extended has government grown\r\n     more stable and society more safe. It has come through a\r\n     succession of steps, invariably opposed by the dominant classes,\r\n     and only permitted after long contest and a changed public\r\n     opinion.\r\n\r\n     In England, where the progress of constitutional government can\r\n     be most accurately traced, there was a time when the landowning\r\n     aristocracy controlled the franchise and elected the members of\r\n     Parliament. The dawn of a sense of injustice in the minds of the\r\n     mercantile classes brought with it a demand for the extension of\r\n     the suffrage, which was of course vigorously combated. It was an\r\n     illogical resistance, which ended in the admission of the\r\n     tradesmen. Later the workingmen awakened to their political\r\n     disability and asserted their rights, only to be promptly\r\n     antagonized by both classes in power. Eventually logic and\r\n     justice won in this issue. In the light of history none of the\r\n     objections urged against the extension of the right of voting\r\n     have been sustained by subsequent facts. On the contrary, the\r\n     broadening of the suffrage base has been found to add stability\r\n     to the superstructure of British government and to have been in\r\n     the interest of true conservatism.\r\n\r\n     In the course of time the woman's hour has struck. Her cause is\r\n     now going through the same ordeal suffered by the classes\r\n     referred to. Her triumph is as sure as theirs. The social and\r\n     industrial changes of constitutional government in all countries\r\n     have revolutionized her condition. Fifty years ago the avenues of\r\n     employment open to women were few and restricted. To-day, in\r\n     every branch of manufacture and trade, and in the professions\r\n     formerly monopolized by men, they are actively and successfully\r\n     engaged. Every law put upon the statute books affects their\r\n     interests directly and indirectly--undreamed of in a social order\r\n     where household drudgery and motherhood limited a woman's\r\n     horizon.\r\n\r\n     It is inevitable, therefore, that, feeling the pressure of\r\n     legislation under which they suffer, a new intelligence should\r\n     stir the minds of women such as stirred the once disfranchised\r\n     classes of men in Great Britain. It leads to an examination of\r\n     the principles of self-government and to their application on\r\n     lines of equality and not of sex. In them is found no\r\n     justification for the present enforced political disability.\r\n     Therefore all legislative bodies vested with the power to change\r\n     the laws are petitioned to consider the justice and expediency of\r\n     allowing women to register their opinions, on the same terms with\r\n     men, at the ballot-box.\r\n\r\n     The principles at stake are rarely alluded to by the opponents of\r\n     woman suffrage. The battle rages chiefly upon the ground of\r\n     expediency. Every argument formerly used by the English Tories is\r\n     to-day heard in the mouths of men who profess a belief in a\r\n     democratic form of government....\r\n\r\n     In the discussion of the rights of labor, the inadequacy of\r\n     wages, the abuses of the factory system, the management of\r\n     schools, of reformatory and penal institutions, the sanitary\r\n     arrangements of a city, the betterment of public highways, the\r\n     encroachment of privileged corporations, the supervision of the\r\n     poor, the improvement of hospitals, and the many branches of\r\n     collective housekeeping included in a municipality--women are by\r\n     nature and education adapted to participate. In many States,\r\n     certainly in Massachusetts, it is a common practice to appoint\r\n     women to responsible positions demanding large organizing and\r\n     directing power. If thus fitted to rule, are women unfitted to\r\n     have a voice in choosing rulers?\r\n\r\n     The true advancement of common interest waits for the active and\r\n     responsible participation of women in political matters. Indirect\r\n     and irresponsible influence they have now, but indirection and\r\n     irresponsibility are dangerous elements in governments which\r\n     assume to be representative, and are a constant menace. If this\r\n     whole question of equal political rights of women is considered\r\n     in the light of common sense and common justice, the sooner will\r\n     the present intolerable wrong be wiped out and self-government be\r\n     put upon a broader and safer basis.\r\n\r\nMrs. May Wright Sewall (Ind.) discussed the Fitness of Women to Become\r\nCitizens from the Standpoint of Education and Mental Development.\r\n\r\n     From the close of the Revolution, we find all the distinguished\r\n     American patriots expressing the conviction that a self-governing\r\n     people must be an educated people. Hancock, Jay, Franklin,\r\n     Morris, Paine, Quincy Adams, Jefferson, Hamilton, Washington, all\r\n     urge the same argument in support of education. It is no longer\r\n     to produce an educated ministry, but to insure educated citizens,\r\n     that schools are maintained and colleges multiplied....\r\n\r\n     In this year of 1897-98 not less than 20,000,000 pupils and\r\n     students of all ages, from the toddlers in the kindergartens to\r\n     the full-grown candidates for post-graduate honors, are\r\n     registered in the schools, academies, colleges and universities\r\n     of the United States. The average length of time which girls\r\n     spend in school exceeds by nearly three years the average length\r\n     of time which boys stay there; while the number of girls\r\n     graduating from high-school courses, those which include United\r\n     States history and civil government, is almost double the number\r\n     of boys. Thus, at the present time, largely more than one-half of\r\n     the moneys spent by the governments, local and national, in\r\n     support of free schools, is used in the education of girls. By\r\n     what authority does the Government tax its citizens to support\r\n     schools for the education of millions of women to whom, after\r\n     they have received the education declared necessary to\r\n     citizenship, this is denied?\r\n\r\n     Is it urged that the Government gets its return upon its\r\n     investment in the education of women through the increased\r\n     intelligence with which women rear their children, manage their\r\n     homes and conduct the larger social affairs outside the boundary\r\n     of their home life? I have no disposition to diminish the\r\n     Government's recognition of such return, but I wish to remind you\r\n     that no one has ever justified the maintenance of public schools,\r\n     and an enforced attendance upon them, on the theory that the\r\n     Government has a right to compel _men_ to be agreeable husbands\r\n     and wise fathers, or that it is responsible for teaching _men_\r\n     how to conduct their own business with discretion and judgment.\r\n     Quite in another tone is it urged that the schools are the\r\n     fountains of the nation's liberties and that a government whose\r\n     policy is decided by a majority of the votes cast by its men is\r\n     not safe in the hands of uneducated voters. ....It is the\r\n     political life of our nation which stands in the sorest need; yet\r\n     this is the only department of our national life which rejects\r\n     the aid of women.\r\n\r\n     If intelligence is vital to good citizenship in a republic, it\r\n     would seem that, to justify the exclusion of the present\r\n     generation of American women, whose intelligence is bought at so\r\n     high a price and at the expense of the whole people, there must\r\n     be some proof that they have qualities which so vitiate it as to\r\n     render it unserviceable. Such proof has never yet been presented.\r\n\r\n     At the present moment the education and the intellectual culture\r\n     of American women has reached a plane where its further\r\n     development is a menace, unless it is to be accompanied by the\r\n     direct responsibility of its possessors--a responsibility which\r\n     in a republic can be felt only by those who participate directly\r\n     in the election of public officers and in the shaping of public\r\n     policies.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Anna Garlin Spencer (R. I.) considered the Fitness of Women\r\nto Become Citizens from the Standpoint of Moral Development.\r\n\r\n     Government is not now merely the coarse and clumsy instrument by\r\n     which military and police forces are directed; it is the\r\n     flexible, changing and delicately adjusted instrument of many and\r\n     varied educative, charitable and supervisory functions, and the\r\n     tendency to increase the functions of government is a growing\r\n     one. Prof. Lester F. Ward says: \"Government is becoming more and\r\n     more the organ of the social consciousness and more and more the\r\n     servant of the social will.\" The truth of this is shown in the\r\n     modern public school system; in the humane and educative care of\r\n     dependent, defective and wayward children; in the increasingly\r\n     discriminating and wise treatment of the insane, the pauper, the\r\n     tramp and the poverty-bound; in the provisions for public parks,\r\n     baths and amusement places; in the bureaus of investigation and\r\n     control and the appointment of officers of inspection to secure\r\n     better sanitary and moral conditions; in the board of arbitration\r\n     for the settlement of political and labor difficulties; and in\r\n     the almost innumerable committees and bills, national, State and\r\n     local, to secure higher social welfare for all classes,\r\n     especially for the weaker and more ignorant. Government can never\r\n     again shrink and harden into a mere mechanism of military and\r\n     penal control.\r\n\r\n     It is, moreover, increasingly apparent that for these wider and\r\n     more delicate functions a higher order of electorate, ethically\r\n     as well as intellectually advanced, is necessary. Democracy can\r\n     succeed only by securing for its public service, through the rule\r\n     of the majority, the best leadership and administration the State\r\n     affords. Only a wise electorate will know how to select such\r\n     leadership, and only a highly moral one will authoritatively\r\n     choose such....\r\n\r\n     When the State took the place of family bonds and tribal\r\n     relationships, and the social consciousness was born and began\r\n     its long travel toward the doctrine of \"equality of human rights\"\r\n     in government and the principle of human brotherhood in social\r\n     organization, man, as the family and tribal organizer and ruler,\r\n     of course took command of the march. It was inevitable, natural\r\n     and beneficent so long as the State concerned itself with only\r\n     the most external and mechanical of social interests. The\r\n     instant, however, the State took upon itself any form of\r\n     educative, charitable or personally helpful work, it entered the\r\n     area of distinctive feminine training and power, and therefore\r\n     became in need of the service of woman. Wherever the State\r\n     touches the personal life of the infant, the child, the youth, or\r\n     the aged, helpless, defective in mind, body or moral nature,\r\n     there the State enters \"woman's peculiar sphere,\" her sphere of\r\n     motherly succor and training, her sphere of sympathetic and\r\n     self-sacrificing ministration to individual lives. If the service\r\n     of women is not won to such governmental action (not only through\r\n     \"influence or the shaping of public opinion,\" but through\r\n     definite and authoritative exercise), the mother-office of the\r\n     State, now so widely adopted, will be too often planned and\r\n     administered as though it were an external, mechanical and\r\n     abstract function, instead of the personal, organic and practical\r\n     service which all right helping of individuals must be.\r\n\r\n     In so far as motherhood has given to women a distinctive ethical\r\n     development, it is that of sympathetic personal insight\r\n     respecting the needs of the weak and helpless, and of\r\n     quick-witted, flexible adjustment of means to ends in the\r\n     physical, mental and moral training of the undeveloped. And thus\r\n     far has motherhood fitted women to give a service to the modern\r\n     State which men can not altogether duplicate....\r\n\r\n     Whatever problems might have been involved in the question of\r\n     woman's place in the State when government was purely military,\r\n     legal and punitive have long since been antedated. Whatever\r\n     problems might have inhered in that question when women were\r\n     personally subject to their families or their husbands are\r\n     well-nigh outgrown in all civilized countries, and entirely so in\r\n     the most advanced. Woman's nonentity in the political department\r\n     of the State is now an anachronism and inconsistent with the\r\n     prevailing tendencies of social growth....\r\n\r\n     The earth is ready, the time is ripe, for the authoritative\r\n     expression of the feminine as well as the masculine\r\n     interpretation of that common social consciousness which is\r\n     slowly writing justice in the State and fraternity in the social\r\n     order.\r\n\r\nMiss Laura Clay (Ky.) illustrated the Fitness of Women to Become\r\nCitizens from the Standpoint of Physical Development.\r\n\r\n     Among the objections brought against the extension of suffrage to\r\n     women, that of their physical unfitness to perform military\r\n     duties is the most plausible, because in the popular mind there\r\n     is an idea that the right of casting a ballot is in its final\r\n     analysis dependent upon the ability to defend it with a\r\n     bullet....\r\n\r\n     It is by no means self-evident that women are naturally unfitted\r\n     for fighting or are unwarlike in disposition. The traditions of\r\n     Amazons and the conduct of savage women give room to believe that\r\n     the instinct for war was primitively very much the same in both\r\n     sexes. Though the earliest division of labor among savages known\r\n     to us is that of assigning war and the chase to men, yet we have\r\n     no reason to believe that this was done by way of privilege to\r\n     women; but in the struggle for tribal supremacy that tribe must\r\n     have ultimately survived and succeeded best which exposed its\r\n     women the least. Polygamy, universal among primitive races, could\r\n     in a degree sustain population against the ravages among men of\r\n     continual warfare, but any large destruction of women must\r\n     extinguish a tribe that suffered it. So those tribes which\r\n     earliest engrafted among their customs the exclusion of women\r\n     from war were the ones that finally survived....\r\n\r\n     Military genius among women has appeared in all ages and people,\r\n     as in Deborah, Zenobia, Joan of Arc and our own Anna Ella\r\n     Carroll. The prowess of women has often been conspicuous in\r\n     besieged cities. Our early history of Indian warfare recounts\r\n     many of their valiant deeds. It is well known that in the late\r\n     war many women on both sides eluded the vigilance of recruiting\r\n     officers, enlisted and fought bravely. Who knows how many of such\r\n     women there might have been if their enlistment had been desired\r\n     and stimulated by beat of drum and blare of trumpet and \"all the\r\n     pomp and circumstance of glorious war?\" But no State can afford\r\n     to accept military service from its women, for while a nation may\r\n     live for ages without soldiers, it could exist but for a span\r\n     without mothers. Since woman's exemption from war is not an\r\n     un-bought privilege, it is evident that in justice men have no\r\n     superior rights as citizens on that account.\r\n\r\n     It is an equally fallacious idea that sound expediency demands\r\n     that every ballot shall be defended by a bullet. The theory of\r\n     representative government does not admit of any connection\r\n     between military service and the right and duty of suffrage, even\r\n     among men. It is trite to point out that the age required for\r\n     military service begins at eighteen years, when a man is too\r\n     young to vote, and ends at forty-five years, when he is usually\r\n     in the prime of his usefulness as a citizen. Some very slight\r\n     physical defects will incapacitate a man under the usual\r\n     recruiting rules. Many lawyers, judges, physicians, ministers,\r\n     merchants, editors, authors, legislators and Congressmen are\r\n     exempt on the ground of physical incapacity. A citizen's ability\r\n     to help govern by voting is in no manner proportioned to ability\r\n     to bear arms....\r\n\r\n     In the finest conception of government not only is there room for\r\n     women to take part, but it can not be realized without help from\r\n     them. Men alone possess only a half of human wisdom; women\r\n     possess the other half of it, and a half that must always be\r\n     somewhat different from men's, because women must always see from\r\n     a somewhat different point of view. The wisdom of men must be\r\n     supplemented by that of women to discover the whole of\r\n     governmental truth. Women's help is equally indispensable in\r\n     persuading society to love and obey law. This help is very\r\n     largely given now, or civilization as we know it would be\r\n     impossible. But the best interests of society demand that women's\r\n     present indirect and half-conscious influence shall be\r\n     strengthened by the right of suffrage, so that their sense of\r\n     duty to government may be stimulated by a clear perception of the\r\n     connection which exists between power and responsibility.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harriot Stanton Blatch (Eng.) treated of Woman as an Economic\r\nFactor.\r\n\r\n     It is often urged that women stand greatly in need of training in\r\n     citizenship before being finally received into the body\r\n     politic.... As a matter of fact women are the first class who\r\n     have asked the right of citizenship after their ability for\r\n     political life has been proved. I have seen in my time two\r\n     enormous extensions of the suffrage to men--one in America and\r\n     one in England. But neither the negroes in the South nor the\r\n     agricultural laborers in Great Britain had shown before they got\r\n     the ballot any capacity for government; for they had never had\r\n     the opportunity to take the first steps in political action. Very\r\n     different has been the history of the march of women toward a\r\n     recognized position in the State. We have had to prove our\r\n     ability at each stage of progress, and have gained nothing\r\n     without having satisfied a test of capacity....\r\n\r\n     The public demand for \"proved worth\" suggests what appears to me\r\n     the chief and most convincing argument upon which our future\r\n     claims must rest--the growing recognition of the economic value\r\n     of the work of women.... There has been a marked change in the\r\n     estimate of our position as wealth producers. We have never been\r\n     \"supported\" by men; for if all men labored hard every hour of the\r\n     twenty-four, they could not do all the work of the world. A few\r\n     worthless women there are, but even they are not so much\r\n     supported by the men of their family as by the overwork of the\r\n     \"sweated\" women at the other end of the social ladder. From\r\n     creation's dawn our sex has done its full share of the world's\r\n     work; sometimes we have been paid for it, but oftener not.\r\n\r\n     Unpaid work never commands respect; it is the paid worker who has\r\n     brought to the public mind conviction of woman's worth. The\r\n     spinning and weaving done by our great-grandmothers in their own\r\n     homes was not reckoned as national wealth until the work was\r\n     carried to the factory and organized there; and the women who\r\n     followed their work were paid according to its commercial value.\r\n     It is the women of the industrial class, the wage-earners,\r\n     reckoned by the hundreds of thousands, and not by units, the\r\n     women whose work has been submitted to a money test, who have\r\n     been the means of bringing about the altered attitude of public\r\n     opinion toward woman's work in every sphere of life.\r\n\r\n     If we would recognize the democratic side of our cause, and make\r\n     an organized appeal to industrial women on the ground of their\r\n     need of citizenship, and to the nation on the ground of its need\r\n     that all wealth producers should form part of its body politic,\r\n     the close of the century might witness the building up of a true\r\n     republic in the United States.\r\n\r\nMrs. Florence Kelley, State Factory Inspector of Illinois, showed the\r\nWorking Woman's Need of the Ballot.\r\n\r\n     No one needs all the powers of the fullest citizenship more\r\n     urgently than the wage-earning woman, and from two different\r\n     points of view--that of actual money wages and that of her wider\r\n     needs as a human being and a member of the community.\r\n\r\n     The wages paid any body of working people are determined by many\r\n     influences, chief among which is the position of the particular\r\n     body of workers in question. Thus the printers, by their\r\n     intelligence, their powerful organization, their solidarity and\r\n     united action, keep up their wages in spite of the invasion of\r\n     their domain by new and improved machinery. On the other hand,\r\n     the garment-workers, the sweaters' victims, poor, unorganized,\r\n     unintelligent, despised, remain forever on the verge of\r\n     pauperism, irrespective of their endless toil. If, now, by some\r\n     untoward fate the printers should suddenly find themselves\r\n     disfranchised, placed in a position in which their members were\r\n     politically inferior to the members of other trades, no effort of\r\n     their own short of complete enfranchisement could restore to them\r\n     that prestige, that good standing in the esteem of their\r\n     fellow-craftsmen and the public at large which they now enjoy,\r\n     and which contributes materially in support of their demand for\r\n     high wages.\r\n\r\n     In the garment trades, on the other hand, the presence of a body\r\n     of the disfranchised, of the weak and young, undoubtedly\r\n     contributes to the economic weakness of these trades. Custom,\r\n     habit, tradition, the regard of the public, both employing and\r\n     employed, for the people who do certain kinds of labor,\r\n     contribute to determine the price of that labor, and no\r\n     disfranchised class of workers can permanently hold its own in\r\n     competition with enfranchised rivals. But this works both ways.\r\n     It is fatal for any body of workers to have forever hanging from\r\n     the fringes of its skirts other bodies on a level just below its\r\n     own; for that means continual pressure downward, additional\r\n     difficulty to be overcome in the struggle to maintain reasonable\r\n     rates of wages. Hence, within the space of two generations there\r\n     has been a complete revolution in the attitude of the\r\n     trades-unions toward the women working in their trades. Whereas\r\n     forty years ago women might have knocked in vain at the doors of\r\n     the most enlightened trade-union, to-day the Federation of Labor\r\n     keeps in the field paid organizers whose duty it is to enlist in\r\n     the unions as many women as possible. The workingmen have\r\n     perceived that women are in the field of industry to stay; and\r\n     they see, too, that there can not be two standards of work and\r\n     wages for any trade without constant menace to the higher\r\n     standard. Hence their effort to place the women upon the same\r\n     industrial level with themselves in order that all may pull\r\n     together in the effort to maintain reasonable conditions of life.\r\n\r\n     But this same menace holds with regard to the vote. The lack of\r\n     the ballot places the wage-earning woman upon a level of\r\n     irresponsibility compared with her enfranchised fellow\r\n     workingman. By impairing her standing in the community the\r\n     general rating of her value as a human being, and consequently as\r\n     a worker, is lowered. In order to be rated as good as a good man\r\n     in the field of her earnings, she must show herself better than\r\n     he. She must be more steady, or more trustworthy, or more\r\n     skilled, or more cheap in order to have the same chance of\r\n     employment. Thus, while women are accused of lowering wages,\r\n     might they not justly reply that it is only by conceding\r\n     something from the pay which they would gladly claim, that they\r\n     can hold their own in the market, so long as they labor under the\r\n     disadvantage of disfranchisement?...\r\n\r\n     Finally, the very fact that women now form about one-fifth of the\r\n     employes in manufacture and commerce in this country has opened a\r\n     vast field of industrial legislation directly affecting women as\r\n     wage-earners. The courts in some of the States, notably in\r\n     Illinois, are taking the position that women can not be treated\r\n     as a class apart and legislated for by themselves, as has been\r\n     done in the factory laws of England and on the continent of\r\n     Europe, but must abide by that universal freedom of contract\r\n     which characterizes labor in the United States. This renders the\r\n     situation of the working woman absolutely anomalous. On the one\r\n     hand, she is cut off from the protection awarded to her sisters\r\n     abroad; on the other, she has no such power to defend her\r\n     interests at the polls, as is the heritage of her brothers at\r\n     home. This position is untenable, and there can be no pause in\r\n     the agitation for full political power and responsibility until\r\n     these are granted to all the women of the nation.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mariana W. Chapman (N. Y.) spoke from the standpoint of Women as\r\nCapitalists and Taxpayers.\r\n\r\n     The first impulse toward the organization of women to protect\r\n     their own rights came from the injustice of laws toward married\r\n     women, and in 1848 it manifested itself in the first Woman's\r\n     Rights Convention in Seneca Falls. Slowly the leaven spread.\r\n     There was agitation in one State after the other about the\r\n     property rights of women.... Now in many States married as well\r\n     as single women are proprietors of business enterprises upon the\r\n     same basis as men, and are interested as capitalists and\r\n     tax-payers in every law which affects the country industrially or\r\n     financially.\r\n\r\n     In 1894 a careful copy was made of the women taxpayers of\r\n     Brooklyn. Names with initials were not placed on the list, so\r\n     that the total was probably under rather than over estimated.\r\n     This showed 22.03 or nearly one-fourth of all the assessable\r\n     realty in the names of women, amounting to $110,000,000, besides\r\n     many large estates in which they were interested. In 1896 the\r\n     assessed value of real estate in the State of New York was\r\n     $4,506,985,694, which, if estimated in the same ratio, would give\r\n     taxable property owned by women to the extent of $1,124,221,423.\r\n\r\n     They are agriculturally interested, inasmuch as they are\r\n     frequently owners of large tracts of land in the West as well as\r\n     of smaller farms in our Eastern States. What shall we say to a\r\n     Government that gives land in severalty to the Indian, supplies\r\n     him with tools and rations, puts a ballot in his hand, and then\r\n     says to the American woman who purchases the same right to land,\r\n     \"You shall not have the political privileges of American\r\n     citizenship?\" Under the laws of our country every stock company\r\n     is obliged to give men and women shareholders a vote upon the\r\n     same basis, and one fails to see why a government, which\r\n     professedly exists to maintain the rights of the people, should\r\n     practice in its own dealing such flaunting injustice....\r\n\r\n     Women help to support every public institution in the State and\r\n     should have representation upon every board, and in the laws\r\n     which control them. They help to pay the army pensions and should\r\n     be allowed to help in deciding how much shall be paid. They help\r\n     to pay for standing armies and for navies and they have the\r\n     larger part in the nurture and training of every man who is in\r\n     army or navy, and this is not the smaller part of the tax, since\r\n     it is at times the matter of a life for a life. Women pay their\r\n     part of the taxes to support our public schools and have intense\r\n     interests in their well-doing. Twenty-six States have recognized\r\n     this fact and have given to women some kind of School Suffrage,\r\n     one has granted Municipal Suffrage and four Full Political\r\n     Equality; but this is only a fraction of the justice which\r\n     belongs to a government founded by statesmen whose watchword was,\r\n     \"No taxation without representation.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Elizabeth Burrill Curtis (N. Y.) answered the question, Are Women\r\nRepresented in our Government?\r\n\r\n     \"Taxation without representation is tyranny\" was one of the\r\n     slogans of liberty in this country one hundred and twenty years\r\n     ago. Have we outlived this principle? If not, why is it supposed\r\n     to have no application to women?\r\n\r\n     That a century ago the latter were not thought of as having any\r\n     rights under this motto is not surprising. So few women then held\r\n     property in their own name that the injustice done them was not\r\n     so apparent. But the situation is changed now, and the right of\r\n     women to be considered as individuals is everywhere acknowledged\r\n     save in this one particular. Even those who feel that the\r\n     granting of universal male suffrage was a mistake, and that the\r\n     right to self-government should be proved by some test,\r\n     educational or otherwise--even those do not assert that it would\r\n     be anything but gross injustice to tax men without allowing them\r\n     a voice in the disposal of their money....\r\n\r\n     But there is still another side to the question. It is not only\r\n     that the disfranchised women are unfairly treated, but the public\r\n     good inevitably suffers from the political nonexistence of half\r\n     the citizens of the republic. Either women are interested in\r\n     politics or they are not. If the former, the country is\r\n     distinctly injured, for nothing is more fatal to good government\r\n     than the intermeddling of a large body of people who have never\r\n     studied the questions at issue and whose only interest is a\r\n     personal one. If, on the other hand, women are not interested in\r\n     politics, what is the condition of that country, half of whose\r\n     citizens do not care whether it be well or ill governed? That\r\n     women influence men is never denied, even by the most strenuous\r\n     opponents of woman suffrage. It is, on the contrary, most\r\n     violently asserted by those very people; but of what value is\r\n     that interest if woman is utterly ignorant of one of the most\r\n     important duties of a man's life?...\r\n\r\n     On one hand the public good demands that no class of citizens be\r\n     arbitrarily prevented from serving the commonweal; and on the\r\n     other hand thinking and patriotic women are crying against the\r\n     injustice which forbids them to prove their fitness for\r\n     self-government. What shall be the result of this double demand?\r\n\r\nWoman Suffrage and the Home was the topic of Henry B. Blackwell\r\n(Mass.).\r\n\r\n     One of the objections to extending suffrage to women is a fear\r\n     that its exercise will divert their attention from domestic\r\n     pursuits, and diminish their devotion to husband, children and\r\n     home. We believe, on the contrary, that it will increase domestic\r\n     happiness by giving women greater self-respect and greater\r\n     respect and consideration from men.\r\n\r\n     People who make this objection seem to regard the conjugal and\r\n     maternal instincts as artificial, as the result of education and\r\n     circumstances, losing sight of the fact that these qualities are\r\n     innate in the feminine soul. Mental cultivation and larger views\r\n     of life do not tend to make women less womanly any more than they\r\n     tend to make men less manly. No one imagines that business or\r\n     politics diminishes or destroys the conjugal and paternal\r\n     instinct in men. We do not look for dull or idle or indolent men\r\n     as husbands for our daughters. Ignorant, narrow-minded men do not\r\n     make the best husbands and fathers. Ignorant, narrow-minded women\r\n     do not make the best wives and mothers. Mental discipline and\r\n     intelligent responsibility add strength to the conjugal and\r\n     parental sentiment alike in men and women....\r\n\r\n     But fortunately this is no longer a question of theory. We appeal\r\n     to the experience of the four States which have extended equal\r\n     suffrage to women. Wyoming has had complete woman suffrage since\r\n     1869. For twenty-nine years, as a Territory and a State, women\r\n     have voted there in larger ratio than men. Supreme Judge J. W.\r\n     Kingman many years ago testified that the actual proportion of\r\n     men voting had increased to 80 per cent., but that 90 per cent.\r\n     of the women went to the polls. And now, after a generation of\r\n     continuous voting, the percentage of divorces in Wyoming is\r\n     smaller than in the surrounding States where women do not vote,\r\n     and while the percentage in the latter is rapidly increasing, in\r\n     Wyoming it is steadily diminishing. Where women have once voted\r\n     the right has never been taken away by the people. In Utah women\r\n     voted for seventeen years while it was a Territory, until\r\n     Congress abolished it for political reasons. But when Utah was\r\n     about to be admitted to statehood the men in framing their\r\n     constitution restored the suffrage to women. Would they have done\r\n     so if it had proved injurious to their homes? Impossible! You\r\n     have eight Senators and seven Representatives in Congress from\r\n     the four States where women have the full franchise. Ask them if\r\n     it has demoralized their homes or the homes of their\r\n     fellow-citizens, and your fears, if you have any, will be forever\r\n     set at rest....\r\n\r\n     Believe me, gentlemen, it is not patriotism, it is not a passion\r\n     for justice, it is not loyalty to sister women, it is not a\r\n     desire to better her country, which will make a woman neglect her\r\n     husband. Society women, superficial, selfish, silly women, the\r\n     butterflies of the ballroom, the seekers for every new sensation,\r\n     the worldly-minded aspirants for social position, these are the\r\n     women who neglect their homes; and not the brave, earnest,\r\n     serious-minded, generous, unselfish women who ask for the ballot\r\n     in order by its use to make the world better. In the twentieth\r\n     century, already dawning, we shall have a republican family in a\r\n     republican nation, a true democracy, a government of the people,\r\n     by the people and for the people, men and women co-operating\r\n     harmoniously on terms of absolute equality in the home and in the\r\n     State.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Hearing closed with the paper of Mrs. Elizabeth Cady\r\nStanton on the Significance and History of the Ballot, which was in\r\npart as follows:\r\n\r\n     The recent bills on Immigration, by Senators Lodge of\r\n     Massachusetts and Kyle of South Dakota, indirectly affect the\r\n     interests of woman. Their proposition to demand a reading and\r\n     writing qualification on landing strikes me as arbitrary and\r\n     equally detrimental to our mutual interests. The danger is not in\r\n     their landing and living in this country, but in their speedy\r\n     appearance at the ballot-box and there becoming an impoverished\r\n     and ignorant balance of power in the hands of wily politicians.\r\n     While we should not allow our country to be a dumping ground for\r\n     the refuse population of the Old World, still we should welcome\r\n     all hardy, common-sense laborers here, as we have plenty of room\r\n     and work for them. Here they can improve their own condition and\r\n     our surroundings, developing our immense resources and the\r\n     commerce of the country. The one demand I would make in regard to\r\n     this class is that they should not become a part of our ruling\r\n     power until they can read and write the English language\r\n     intelligently and understand the principles of republican\r\n     government. This is the only restrictive legislation we need to\r\n     protect ourselves against foreign domination. To this end the\r\n     Congress should enact a law for \"educated suffrage\" for our\r\n     native-born as well as foreign rulers.\r\n\r\n     With free schools and compulsory education, no one has an excuse\r\n     for not understanding the language of the country. As women are\r\n     governed by a \"male aristocracy,\" they are doubly interested in\r\n     having their rulers able at least to read and write. See with\r\n     what care in the Old World the prospective heirs to the throne\r\n     are educated. There was a time when the members of the British\r\n     Parliament could neither read nor write, but these\r\n     accomplishments are now required of the Lords and Commons, and\r\n     even of the King and Queen, while we have rulers, native and\r\n     foreign, who do not understand the letters of the alphabet; and\r\n     this in a republic supposed to be based on intelligence of the\r\n     people!\r\n\r\n     Much as we need this measure for the stability of our Government,\r\n     we need it still more for the best interests of women. This\r\n     ignorant vote is solid against woman's emancipation. In States\r\n     where amendments to their constitutions are proposed for the\r\n     enfranchisement of women, this vote has been in every case\r\n     against them. We should ask for national protection against this\r\n     hostile force playing football with the most sacred rights of\r\n     one-half of the people.... In all national conflicts it is ever\r\n     deemed the most grievous accident of war for the conquered people\r\n     to find themselves under a foreign yoke, yet this is the position\r\n     of the women of this republic to-day. Foreigners are our judges\r\n     and jurors, our legislators and municipal officials, and decide\r\n     all questions of interest to us, even to the discipline in our\r\n     schools, charitable institutions and prisons. Woman has no voice\r\n     as to the education of her children or the environments of the\r\n     unhappy wards of the State. The love and sympathy of the\r\n     mother-soul have but an evanescent influence in all departments\r\n     of human interest until coined into law by the hand that holds\r\n     the ballot. Then only do they become a direct and effective power\r\n     in the Government....\r\n\r\n     The popular objection to woman suffrage is that it would \"double\r\n     the ignorant vote.\" The patent answer to this is, \"Abolish the\r\n     ignorant vote.\" Our legislators have this power in their own\r\n     hands. There have been serious restrictions in the past for men.\r\n     We are willing to abide by the same for women, provided the\r\n     insurmountable qualification of sex be forever removed. Some of\r\n     the opponents talk as if educated suffrage would be invidious to\r\n     the best interests of the laboring masses, whereas it would be\r\n     most beneficial in its ultimate influence.... Surely when we\r\n     compel all classes to learn to read and write and thus open to\r\n     themselves the door to knowledge, not by force, but by the\r\n     promise of a privilege which all intelligent citizens enjoy, we\r\n     are benefactors and not tyrants. To stimulate them to climb the\r\n     first rounds of the ladder that they may reach the divine heights\r\n     where they shall be as gods, knowing good and evil, by\r\n     withholding the citizen's right to vote for a few years is a\r\n     blessing to them as well as to the State.\r\n\r\n     We must inspire our people with a new sense of their sacred\r\n     duties as citizens of a republic, and place new guards around our\r\n     ballot-box. Walking in Paris one day I was greatly impressed with\r\n     an emblematic statue in the square Chateau d'Eau, placed there in\r\n     1883 in honor of the republic. On one side is a magnificent\r\n     bronze lion with his fore paw on the electoral urn, which answers\r\n     to our ballot-box, as if to guard it from all unholy uses.... As\r\n     I turned away I thought of the American republic and our\r\n     ballot-box with no guardian or sacred reverence for its contents.\r\n     Ignorance, poverty and vice have full access; thousands from\r\n     every incoming steamer go practically from the steerage to the\r\n     polls, while educated women, representing the virtue and\r\n     intelligence of the nation, are driven away. I would like to see\r\n     a monument to \"educated suffrage\" in front of our national\r\n     Capitol, guarded by the goddess Minerva, her right hand resting\r\n     on the ballot-box, her left hand on the spelling book, the\r\n     Declaration of Rights and the Federal Constitution. It would be\r\n     well for us to ponder the Frenchman's idea, but instead of the\r\n     royal lion, representing force to guard the sacred urn, let us\r\n     substitute wisdom and virtue in the form of Woman.\r\n\r\nThe Washington _Star_ said of the hearing before the House Judiciary\r\nCommittee:\r\n\r\n     The members paid a tribute to the devotion of the woman\r\n     suffragists, and at the same time showed appreciation of it by\r\n     nearly all being in attendance at the hearing this morning. It is\r\n     seldom that more than a quorum of any committee can be induced to\r\n     attend a hearing of any sort. To-day fifteen out of seventeen\r\n     members were present and manifested a deep interest in the\r\n     remarks submitted by the women. The character of the assemblage\r\n     was one to inspire respect, and the force and intelligence of\r\n     what was said warranted the attention and interest shown. The\r\n     people who not many years ago thought that every woman suffragist\r\n     was a masculine creature who \"wanted to wear the pants\" would\r\n     have been greatly embarrassed in their theories had they been\r\n     present at the hearing to-day. There was not a mannish-appearing\r\n     woman among the number. It was such an assemblage as may be seen\r\n     at a popular church on Sunday, or at a fashionable afternoon\r\n     reception. In fact there was not anywhere such an affectation of\r\n     masculinity as is common among the society women of the period.\r\n     Each year there have appeared more young women at these hearings,\r\n     and the average of youth seemed greater to-day than ever before.\r\n     Fashionably attired and in good taste, representative of the\r\n     highest grade of American womanhood, the fifty or sixty women\r\n     present inspired respect for their opinions without destroying\r\n     the sentiment of gallantry which men generally feel that they\r\n     must extend towards women.\r\n\r\nThe speakers before this committee[115] presented The Practical\r\nWorking of Woman Suffrage. Miss Anthony introduced them. Limited\r\nSuffrage in the United States was discussed by Prof. Ellen H. E. Price\r\nof Swarthmore College, Penn., whose address was rendered especially\r\nvaluable by a carefully compiled table of statistics showing the\r\namount of suffrage possessed by women in every State and Territory.\r\nMunicipal Suffrage in Kansas was described by J. W. Gleed; Woman\r\nSuffrage in Wyoming by ex-U. S. Senator Joseph M. Carey; Woman\r\nSuffrage in Colorado by the Hon. Martha A. B. Conine, member of its\r\nState Legislature; Woman Suffrage in Idaho by Wm. Balderston, editor\r\nof the Boisé _Statesman_; Woman Suffrage in Foreign Countries by Miss\r\nHelen Blackburn, editor _The Englishwomen's Review_.[116] Woman\r\nSuffrage in Utah was depicted by State Senator Martha Hughes Cannon:\r\n\r\n     ....The history of the struggle in Utah for equal rights is full\r\n     of interest and could be recounted with advantage. But, after\r\n     all, the results which have been attained speak with such\r\n     unerring logic, and vindicate so thoroughly the argument that\r\n     woman should take part in the affairs of government which so\r\n     vitally affect her, that I point to the actual conditions now\r\n     existing as a complete vindication of the efforts of equal\r\n     suffragists, and as the most cogent of all reasons why woman\r\n     should have the right to aid in nominating and electing our\r\n     public officers.\r\n\r\n     I can say, in all sincerity, that there is a strong and\r\n     cumulative evidence that even those who opposed equal suffrage\r\n     with the greatest ability and vehemence would not now vote for\r\n     the repeal of the measure. The practical working of the law\r\n     demonstrates its wisdom and verifies the claims which were\r\n     advanced by its ardent advocates. It has proved to the world that\r\n     woman is not only a helpmeet by the fireside, but when allowed to\r\n     do so she can become a most powerful factor in the affairs of the\r\n     Government.\r\n\r\n     None of the unpleasant results which were predicted have\r\n     occurred. The contentions in families, the tarnishment of woman's\r\n     charm, the destruction of ideals, have all been proved to be but\r\n     the ghosts of unfounded prejudices. \"The divinity which doth\r\n     hedge woman about like subtle perfume\" has not been displaced.\r\n     Women have quietly assumed the added power which always was\r\n     theirs by right, and with the grace and ready adaptation to\r\n     circumstances peculiar to the women of America, they have so\r\n     conducted themselves that they have gained admiration and respect\r\n     while losing none of their old-time prestige.\r\n\r\n     Before suffrage was granted to women they had ideas upon public\r\n     questions. Suffrage has given them opportunity for practical\r\n     expression of these views. They pay more attention to political\r\n     affairs. They studied political economy more earnestly. They\r\n     familiarize themselves with public questions, and their mistakes,\r\n     if they have made any, have not thus far been brought to light.\r\n\r\n     Women have acted as delegates to county and State conventions,\r\n     and represented Utah in the national convention of one of the\r\n     great political parties, held in Chicago in 1896. They have acted\r\n     upon political committees and have taken part in political\r\n     management, and, instead of being dragged down, as was most\r\n     feared, their enfranchisement has tended to elevate them. Under\r\n     our system of the Australian ballot, they have found that the\r\n     contaminating influence of which they had been told was but a\r\n     bugbear, born of fright, produced by shadows. They learned that\r\n     to deposit their vote did not subject them to anything like the\r\n     annoyance which they often experienced from crowds on \"bargain\r\n     days,\" while their presence drove from the polls the ward workers\r\n     who had been so obnoxious in the past.\r\n\r\n     Through the courtesy of the Governor and the approval of the\r\n     Senate they have been given places upon various State boards, and\r\n     in the last Legislature, in both the Senate and the House, they\r\n     represented the two most populous and wealthy counties of Utah.\r\n     The bills introduced by women received due consideration, and a\r\n     majority were enacted into laws. Whatever they have been required\r\n     to do they have done to the full satisfaction of their\r\n     constituents, and they have proved most careful and painstaking\r\n     public officers.\r\n\r\n     No one in Utah will dispute the statements I have made. To the\r\n     people of that young commonwealth, destined by its manifold\r\n     resources and the intelligence of its men and women to become the\r\n     Empire State of the Rocky Mountains, I refer you, in the fullest\r\n     confidence that, with scarcely a dissenting voice, they will say\r\n     that woman suffrage is no longer an experiment, but is a\r\n     practical reality, tending to the well-being of the State.\r\n\r\nMiss Alice Stone Blackwell, national recording secretary, took for a\r\nsubject The Indifference of Women:\r\n\r\n     It is often said that the chief obstacle to equal suffrage is the\r\n     indifference and opposition of women, and that whenever the\r\n     majority ask for the ballot they will get it. But it is a simple\r\n     historical fact that every improvement thus far made in their\r\n     condition has been secured, not by a general demand from the\r\n     majority, but by the arguments, entreaties and \"continual coming\"\r\n     of a persistent few. In each case the advocates of progress have\r\n     had to contend not merely with the conservatism of men, but with\r\n     the indifference of women, and often with active opposition from\r\n     some of them.\r\n\r\n     When a man in Saco, Me., first employed a saleswoman the men\r\n     boycotted his store, and the women remonstrated with him on the\r\n     sin of which he was guilty in placing a young woman in a position\r\n     of such publicity. When Lucy Stone tried to secure for married\r\n     women the right to their own property, they asked with scorn, \"Do\r\n     you think I would give myself where I would not give my\r\n     property?\" When Elizabeth Blackwell began to study medicine, the\r\n     women at her boarding house refused to speak to her, and those\r\n     passing her on the streets would hold their skirts aside so as\r\n     not to touch her. It is a matter of history with what ridicule\r\n     and opposition Mary Lyon's first efforts for the education of\r\n     women were received, not only by the mass of men, but by the mass\r\n     of women as well. In England when the Oxford examinations were\r\n     thrown open to women, the Dean of Chichester preached a sermon\r\n     against it, in which he said: \"By the sex at large, certainly,\r\n     the new curriculum is not asked for. I have ascertained, by\r\n     extended inquiry among gentlewomen, that, with true feminine\r\n     instinct, they either entirely distrust or else look with\r\n     downright disfavor on so wild an innovation and interference with\r\n     the best traditions of their sex.\" Pundita Ramabai tells us that\r\n     the idea of education for girls is so unpopular with the majority\r\n     of Hindoo women that when a progressive Hindoo proposes to\r\n     educate his little daughter it is not uncommon for the women of\r\n     his family to threaten to drown themselves.\r\n\r\n     All this merely shows that human nature is conservative, and that\r\n     it is fully as conservative in women as in men. The persons who\r\n     take a strong interest in any reform are always comparatively\r\n     few, whether among men or women, and they are habitually regarded\r\n     with disfavor, even by those whom the proposed reform is to\r\n     benefit. Thomas Hughes says, in School Days at Rugby: \"So it is,\r\n     and must be always, my dear boys. If the Angel Gabriel were to\r\n     come down from heaven and head a successful rise against the most\r\n     abominable and unrighteous vested interest which this poor old\r\n     world groans under, he would most certainly lose his character\r\n     for many years, probably for centuries, not only with the\r\n     upholders of the said vested interest, but with the respectable\r\n     mass of the people whom he had delivered.\"\r\n\r\n     Many changes for the better have been made during the last half\r\n     century in the laws, written and unwritten, relating to women.\r\n     Everybody approves of these changes now, because they have become\r\n     accomplished facts. But not one of them would have been made to\r\n     this day if it had been necessary to wait until the majority of\r\n     women asked for it. The change now under discussion is to be\r\n     judged on its merits. In the light of history the indifference of\r\n     most women and the opposition of a few must be taken as a matter\r\n     of course. It has no more rational significance than it has had\r\n     in regard to each previous step of woman's progress.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony closed with an impassioned argument which profoundly\r\nmoved both the committee and the audience. The chairman said that in\r\nall the years there had never been so dignified, logical and perfectly\r\nmanaged a hearing before the Judiciary, and several of its members\r\ncorroborated this statement and assured the ladies present of a full\r\nbelief in the justice of their cause. Yet neither the Senate nor the\r\nHouse Committee made any report or paid the slightest heed to these\r\nearnest and eloquent appeals.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[112] The Sunday afternoon preceding the convention religious services\r\nwere held in the theatre, which was crowded. The sermon was given by\r\nthe Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, from the text, \"One shall chase a thousand\r\nand two put ten thousand to flight.\"\r\n\r\n[113] A most interesting account of that historic occasion may be\r\nfound in the History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. I, p. 67.\r\n\r\n[114] Federal Suffrage is considered in Chapter I.\r\n\r\n[115] David B.

It\r\nwas thought by many that this was an unfavorable season, as the\r\naudiences were not so large as usual, but in all other respects it was\r\none of the most delightful of these many gatherings. The meetings were\r\nheld in the handsome St. Cecilia Club House, whose auditorium seats\r\n1,200, and the official report, usually confined to bare details,\r\ncontains the following account:\r\n\r\n     The music arranged by Mrs. Rathbone Carpenter and her efficient\r\n     committee was throughout of the finest character and fully\r\n     justified the reputation of Grand Rapids as a musical community.\r\n     Mrs. W. D. Giddings, chairman of decorations, worked daily with\r\n     different members of her committee in arranging the cut flowers\r\n     and decorative plants generously furnished by different florists,\r\n     so that the platform was beautiful and fragrant from beginning to\r\n     end of the meetings. At the evening sessions the audience was\r\n     seated by the help of young lady ushers under the management of\r\n     Mrs. Marie Wilson Beasley.\r\n\r\n     The Bureau of Information, under the charge of Mrs. H. Margaret\r\n     Downs; the Courtesies, chairman, Mrs. Delos A. Blodgett, and the\r\n     opening reception on the first evening of the convention,\r\n     chairman, Mrs. William Alden Smith, were ably managed. But, with\r\n     the exception of the work devolving upon Mrs. Ketcham, the most\r\n     constant and trying labor fell to the chairman of entertainment,\r\n     Mrs. Allen C. Adsit, who cared for the housing of all the\r\n     delegates and also of the Michigan friends in attendance.\r\n\r\n     Of the efforts bf Mrs. Emily B. Ketcham the entire convention\r\n     bore witness; it went to Grand Rapids upon her invitation, and\r\n     upon her work for many months before its opening depended its\r\n     success, which was unquestioned. At one of the evening sessions\r\n     she was surprised by the presentation of a handsome souvenir of\r\n     the occasion containing the signatures of the officers of the\r\n     association, the speakers and many of the local workers. At the\r\n     close of the first evening the National officers, assisted by\r\n     Mrs. Ketcham, Mrs. William Alden Smith, Mrs. Julius Burrows and\r\n     several of the speakers, received in the beautiful parlor of the\r\n     St. Cecilia, thus giving delegates and visitors an opportunity to\r\n     meet the people of the city and to exchange social greetings with\r\n     each other.\r\n\r\n     The Ladies' Literary Club, which also owns its home, kept open\r\n     house several afternoons from four to six, the officers receiving\r\n     the guests and serving light refreshments. This club also\r\n     tendered the freedom of its house for any and all hours of the\r\n     day to the delegates. Saturday afternoon the Federation of the\r\n     Woman's Christian Temperance Unions of Grand Rapids received the\r\n     convention at the Young Woman's Building, where a substantial\r\n     supper was served. The Bissell carpet-sweeper factory, president,\r\n     Mrs. M. R. Bissell, presented to the delegates one hundred and\r\n     fifty specially made small carpet-sweepers, each marked in gilt,\r\n     National American Woman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n     But to the Board of Trade belongs the honor of having outrivaled\r\n     all the other kind hosts in the extent of their hospitality. They\r\n     presented to the convention its programs, beautifully printed on\r\n     extra fine paper and bearing a picture of the St. Cecilia Club\r\n     House. The Board also sent carriages to take the entire working\r\n     convention for a drive through the city, a visit to one of the\r\n     largest furniture warehouses and to the carpet-sweeper factory,\r\n     where Mrs. Bissell received the delegates and all were shown\r\n     through the works. A handsome souvenir containing many views of\r\n     the city was given by the Board to every delegate.\r\n\r\n     The ladies of the St. Cecilia were kindness itself, and it was\r\n     delightful to hold the meetings in so friendly an atmosphere, as\r\n     well as in so well appointed a building. The president, Mrs.\r\n     Kelsey, presented to the badge committee St. Cecilia pins having\r\n     a reproduction of Carlo Dolci's head of the musical saint after\r\n     whom this club is named, the only musical society of women in the\r\n     United States which owns a club-house.\r\n\r\n     Cordial addresses of welcome were made by Emily B. Ketcham,\r\n     president of Susan B. Anthony Club; Mary Atwater Kelsey,\r\n     president of St. Cecilia; Josephine Ahnafeldt Goss, president of\r\n     Ladies' Literary Club; May Stocking Knaggs, president of State\r\n     Equal Suffrage Association; Martha A. Keating, president of State\r\n     Federation of Women's Clubs; Mrs. A. S. Benjamin, president of\r\n     State Women's Christian Temperance Union; Mary A. McConnelly,\r\n     department president of State Woman's Relief Corps; Lucy A.\r\n     Leggett, president of State Woman's Press Association, and\r\n     Frances E. Burns, Great Commander Ladies of the Maccabees.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ketcham expressed their pleasure in having Grand Rapids selected\r\nin preference to several larger cities which had extended invitations;\r\nreferred to the long distances many of the delegates had come and\r\nassured the convention of a royal welcome, not only from the city but\r\nfrom the State. Brief extracts must give an idea of the scope and\r\ncordiality of these addresses:\r\n\r\n     MRS. GOSS: This has been called the woman's century. The past\r\n     centuries might have been called man's, because of the great\r\n     progress he has made in them; and it is now conceded that God\r\n     made women to match the men. The next will be the children's\r\n     century, when they will make real their parents' ideals. After\r\n     humanity has been sufficiently educated, people will understand\r\n     that no class has a right to special privileges, or can\r\n     appropriate them without injury to the body politic. Then a woman\r\n     will not demand any special privilege because she is a woman, nor\r\n     be denied it because she is not a man. As a result of this\r\n     movement, old lessons have been better learned and old burdens\r\n     more easily carried. We advocate equal suffrage not alone because\r\n     it is just to the mothers, but because it will be good for the\r\n     children, good for man, good for all humanity. We are glad to be\r\n     a part of this movement for a higher civilization. Grand Rapids\r\n     is noted for its furniture factories, and after equal suffrage is\r\n     granted it will supply plenty of material for the President's\r\n     cabinet.\r\n\r\n     MRS. KNAGGS: I welcome you in behalf of the Michigan E. S. A.,\r\n     representing the women of this State who are especially\r\n     interested in woman's enfranchisement. We have looked forward to\r\n     the day when you would bring us the inspiration of one of these\r\n     great meetings; we needed it. We are told that women are\r\n     indifferent. Many are so; and nothing can better arouse us than\r\n     to meet those engaged in this work from so many different places.\r\n\r\n     An alderman this spring boasted that he had been elected by the\r\n     votes of eight nationalities. He enumerated seven of them but for\r\n     some time was unable to think of the eighth. At last he\r\n     remembered; it was the American. The ballot in the hands of our\r\n     present voters might be improved by the intelligence that the\r\n     great body of Michigan women would bring to it. We are beginning\r\n     to appreciate the solidarity of women. When one State wins\r\n     suffrage, all the others are gainers by it. The good of this\r\n     meeting will go abroad over the country.\r\n\r\n     MRS. KEATING: ....In the happy tone of welcome that you may hear\r\n     rising from all parts of our State the club women join, with\r\n     voices 9,000 strong. We have never been happier than now, even\r\n     during the annual club elections, amid the joy and intelligence\r\n     of the club ballot. Your fame has preceded you.\r\n\r\n     MRS. BENJAMIN: The W. C. T. U. of Michigan numbers about 9,000\r\n     active members, and I bring you the greeting of your white-ribbon\r\n     sisters. We welcome not only you but your principles, and your\r\n     avowed determination to conquer before you die. A good mother\r\n     works in the home, but she would not wish to be forbidden to\r\n     cross the threshold. For the good of her child, she needs\r\n     sometimes to cross it. A mother should guard her child outside\r\n     the home as well as in it. Every mother worthy of the name wishes\r\n     to protect her own child from vice, and her duty extends to her\r\n     neighbor's child also. Equal suffrage is coming, friends, and\r\n     coming soon.\r\n\r\n     MRS. BURNS: I bring you the welcome of the 45,000 Ladies of the\r\n     Maccabees. Times have greatly changed in Michigan since seventy\r\n     years ago, when the Indian squaws did all the manual labor, and\r\n     the braves limited themselves to the noble task of hunting. There\r\n     has been a corresponding change in the condition of women all\r\n     along the line.\r\n\r\nIn the response of Miss Susan B. Anthony, the national president, she\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     Since our last convention the area of disfranchisement in the\r\n     possessions of the United States has been greatly enlarged. Our\r\n     nation has undertaken to furnish provisional governments for\r\n     Hawaii and the Philippine Islands, Cuba and Porto Rico. Hitherto\r\n     the settlers of new Territories have been permitted to frame\r\n     their own provisional governments, which were ratified by\r\n     Congress, but to-day Congress itself assumes the prerogative of\r\n     making the laws for the newly-acquired Territories. When the\r\n     governments for those in the West were organized there had been\r\n     no practical example of universal suffrage in any one of the\r\n     older States, hence it might be pardonable for their settlers to\r\n     ignore the right of the women associated with them to a voice in\r\n     their governments.\r\n\r\n     But to-day, after fifty years' continuous agitation of the right\r\n     of women to vote, and after the demand has been conceded in\r\n     one-half the States in the management of the public schools;\r\n     after one State has added to that of the schools the management\r\n     of its cities; and after four States have granted women the full\r\n     vote--the universal reports show that the exercise of the\r\n     suffrage by women has added to their influence, increased the\r\n     respect of men, and elevated the moral, social and political\r\n     conditions of their respective commonwealths. With those\r\n     object-lessons before Congress, it would seem that no member\r\n     could be so blind as not to see it the duty of that body to have\r\n     the provisional governments of our new possessions founded on the\r\n     principle of equal rights, privileges and immunities for all the\r\n     people, women included. I hope this convention will devise some\r\n     plan for securing a strong expression of public sentiment on this\r\n     question, to be presented to the Fifty-sixth Congress, which is\r\n     to convene on the first Monday of December next....\r\n\r\n     During the reconstruction period and the discussion of the\r\n     negro's right to vote Senator Blaine and others opposed the\r\n     counting of all the negroes in the basis of representation,\r\n     instead of the old-time three-fifths, because they saw that to do\r\n     so would greatly increase the power of the white men of the South\r\n     on the floor of Congress. Therefore the Republican leaders\r\n     insisted upon the Fourteenth and Fifteenth Amendments to secure\r\n     the ballot to the negro men. Only one generation has passed and\r\n     yet nearly all of the Southern States have by one device or\r\n     another succeeded in excluding from the ballot-box very nearly\r\n     the entire negro vote, openly and defiantly declaring their\r\n     intention to secure the absolute supremacy of the white race, but\r\n     there is not a suggestion on their part of allowing the citizens\r\n     to whom they deny the right of suffrage to be counted out from\r\n     the basis of representation. Some of the Northern newspapers\r\n     have been growing indignant upon the subject, declaring that a\r\n     vote in South Carolina counts more than two votes in New York, in\r\n     the election of the President and the House of Representatives.\r\n     It seems to me that a still greater violation of the principle of\r\n     \"the consent of the governed\" is practiced in all the States of\r\n     the Union where women, though disfranchised, are yet counted in\r\n     the basis of representation, and I think the time has come when\r\n     this association should make a most strenuous demand for an\r\n     amendment to the Constitution of the United States forbidding any\r\n     State thus to count disfranchised citizens....\r\n\r\n     The increased discussion of the enfranchisement of women in the\r\n     newspapers throughout the country evidences the larger demand of\r\n     the public for information on this line, and a vast amount of\r\n     educational work is being done in this way.... The presentation\r\n     of the woman question in the New York _Sunday Sun_ each week by\r\n     Mrs. Ida Husted Harper, with the articles it has elicited from\r\n     the opposition, is of incalculable value; and when we add to the\r\n     number of people who read the _Sun_ the vast numbers who read the\r\n     copies of these articles made by the many newspapers between the\r\n     two oceans, we see what an immense reading audience is gained by\r\n     getting our question into that one of the best New York dailies.\r\n     We must remember that these papers never would have copied Mrs.\r\n     Harper's or any other literary woman's productions had they been\r\n     first published in one of our special organs; therefore one very\r\n     important branch of press work is to gain access to the\r\n     metropolitan dailies. Then there is the immense work done by Mrs.\r\n     Elnora M. Babcock for the State of New York, and by the chairmen\r\n     of the different State press committees, as well as that done by\r\n     our national organizer from the headquarters. Never has the press\r\n     of the entire nation been kept so alive with discussions upon the\r\n     woman suffrage question as during the past year, and my hope is\r\n     that we may yet have upon every one of the great city papers a\r\n     strong, educated suffrage woman, as editor of a woman's page or,\r\n     better still, as writer of suffrage articles to be inserted\r\n     without a special heading which would advertise to the general\r\n     reader that they were about women.\r\n\r\n     Though we have not obtained the suffrage in any of the States\r\n     where we had hoped to do so during the past year, the failures\r\n     have been by very small majorities. In South Dakota, where eight\r\n     years ago a woman suffrage amendment was lost by a majority of\r\n     over 23,000, at the election of 1898 the opposing majority was\r\n     reduced to 3,000; while in Washington, where the question was\r\n     submitted for the second time, it was lost by a majority less\r\n     than one-half as large as that of nine years ago. In California\r\n     both Houses of the Legislature passed the School Suffrage Bill,\r\n     which the Governor refused to sign, repeating the action of 1894.\r\n     The suffrage bills in the Territorial Legislatures of Oklahoma\r\n     and Arizona were carried by very fine majorities through both\r\n     lower Houses, but were lost in both upper Houses (as will be\r\n     stated by our national organizer, who led our suffrage hosts in\r\n     each case) through a shameful surrender to the temptation of\r\n     bribery from the open and avowed enemies of woman's\r\n     enfranchisement, the liquor organizations.\r\n\r\n     None of these so-called defeats ought to discourage us in the\r\n     slightest degree. Our enemies, the women remonstrants, may\r\n     comfort themselves with the thought that the liquor interest has\r\n     joined in their efforts, but we surely can solace ourselves with\r\n     the fact that the very best men voted in favor of allowing women\r\n     to exercise their right to a voice in the conditions of home and\r\n     State. So we have nothing to fear but everything to gain by going\r\n     forward with renewed faith to agitate and educate the public,\r\n     until the vast majority of men and women are thoroughly grounded\r\n     in the great principle of political equality....\r\n\r\n     I thank you, friends, for your cordial words of welcome. We are\r\n     glad to come here. I always feel a certain kinship to Michigan\r\n     since the constitutional amendment campaign of 1874, in which I\r\n     assisted. I remember that I went across one city on a dray, the\r\n     only vehicle I could secure, in order to catch a train. A\r\n     newspaper said next day: \"That ancient daughter of Methuselah,\r\n     Susan B. Anthony, passed through our city last night, with a\r\n     bonnet looking as if she had just descended from Noah's Ark.\" Now\r\n     if Susan B. Anthony had represented votes, that young political\r\n     editor would not have cared if she were the oldest or youngest\r\n     daughter of Methuselah, or whether her bonnet came from the Ark\r\n     or from the most fashionable man milliner's.\r\n\r\n     There are women's clubs all over the country; did you ever hear\r\n     of one organized for other than an uplifting purpose? (Several\r\n     voices: \"Yes, the Anti-Suffrage Associations!\") Well, even the\r\n     \"antis\" wish to keep the world just as it is; they do not aim to\r\n     make it worse. Some persons have tried to belittle the resolution\r\n     passed by the Colorado Legislature recently, testifying to the\r\n     good results of equal suffrage, by declaring that the members\r\n     were afraid of the women. I never heard before of a Legislature\r\n     that voted solidly in a certain way for fear of women. We have\r\n     with us to-day Mrs. Welch, the president of the Colorado Equal\r\n     Suffrage Association, of whom it is said that the Legislature was\r\n     so afraid. [Miss Anthony led forward Mrs. Welch, a pretty little\r\n     woman in a very feminine bonnet, who shrank away slightly from\r\n     the compelling hand, and showed shyness in every line of her\r\n     figure, as she felt the eyes of the audience' concentrated upon\r\n     her.] At the time of the first recognition of women in the early\r\n     Granger days, when the farmers used to harness up their horses to\r\n     their big wagons and take all their women folks to the meetings,\r\n     I used to say that I could tell a Grange woman as far off as I\r\n     could see her, because of her air of feeling herself as good as a\r\n     man. Now look at this woman from Colorado!\r\n\r\n     MRS. WELCH: When I came before the Executive Committee this\r\n     morning, and they said they were proud of me as a free woman, I\r\n     felt almost ashamed to be a free woman. I thought of all the\r\n     tears and sorrows and struggles of Miss Anthony and wondered if\r\n     she ever would possess the ballot for which she had done so much,\r\n     and I so little.\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY: I am glad you have it. We are not working for\r\n     ourselves alone; that is one reason why our society does not grow\r\n     as fast as some others.\r\n\r\nThe paper of the Rev. Anna Garlin Spencer (R. I.) was a strong,\r\nphilosophical presentation of our Duty to the Women of Our New\r\nPossessions:\r\n\r\n     ....Prof. Otis T. Mason, author of that important book, \"Woman's\r\n     Share in Primitive Culture,\" tells us that \"the longer one\r\n     studies the subject the more he will be convinced that savage\r\n     tribes can now be elevated chiefly through their women.\" Why is\r\n     this true? For the reason that the savage is in the stage of\r\n     social order through which all civilized nations have passed at\r\n     some period--the stage of the mother-rule more or less modified\r\n     by partial masculine domination. It is a well-known fact of human\r\n     history and prehistoric record that the Matriarchate, or the\r\n     mother-rule, preceded the Patriarchate, or the father-rule. \"All\r\n     the social fabrics of the world are built around women. The first\r\n     stable society was a mother and her child.\" The reason why the\r\n     primitive descent of name and property, and the first fixed stake\r\n     of home life, was the expression of this maternal relationship is\r\n     obvious. Motherhood was demonstrated by nature before fatherhood\r\n     was definitely known. Inheritance of name by the female line was\r\n     alone possible; and that, as well as the female holding and\r\n     transmitting of property, was a family or tribal or clan\r\n     relationship, women always retaining rule and wealth not so much\r\n     as individuals as custodians of communal life and possessions.\r\n     Not only was the mother with the child the first founder of human\r\n     society, but the woman in savage life was the first inventor and\r\n     originator of all life-sustaining industries....\r\n\r\n     When man also began to \"settle down\"--whether from personal\r\n     choice or from social pressure--when he, too, began to learn and\r\n     practice the industrial arts heretofore solely in the hands of\r\n     women, he began to press his more personal and individualistic\r\n     claims of recognition and of property-owning against the family\r\n     wealth of which the woman was the custodian.\r\n\r\n     As man more and more assumed the burden of the world's industries\r\n     outside the home (which before had been woman's care alone), and\r\n     as woman became more and more absorbed in purely domestic\r\n     concerns, man's individualism assumed greater and greater power\r\n     within the family life, and he gradually acquired the despotic\r\n     family headship which marked the ancient patriarchal order of\r\n     Rome. This was not a social descent, but an immense social\r\n     uplift, in the age in which it was natural. Professor Mason says,\r\n     and with profound truth, \"Matrimony in all ages is an effort to\r\n     secure to the child the authenticity of the father.\" It was\r\n     necessary for social growth that offspring should have two\r\n     parents instead of one; that the division of labor should be more\r\n     equal, and man be fastened to domestic needs by bonds he could\r\n     not break, and through labors which were peaceful as well as\r\n     arduous. For that process his individualism, developed through\r\n     ages of free wandering and purely militant life, must be not only\r\n     tamed somewhat, but harnessed to the home life.\r\n\r\n     To accomplish that mighty social uplift by which offspring\r\n     secured two parents instead of one, woman's subjection to man was\r\n     paid as the price of the higher form of family unity. Nor was her\r\n     subjection to man in the ruder ages of the world wholly an evil\r\n     to herself. It has been said that \"woman was first the wife of\r\n     any, second the wife of many, and third one of many wives.\" Each\r\n     of these steps was an advance in her sexual relationship. All\r\n     were stepping-stones to the monogamic union which is the standard\r\n     of our civilization, and the realized ideal of all our best and\r\n     wisest men and women....\r\n\r\n     Bebel says, \"Woman was the first human being to taste of\r\n     bondage.\" True, and her bondage has been long and bitter; but the\r\n     subjection of woman to man in the family bond was a vast step\r\n     upward from the preceding condition. It gave woman release from\r\n     the terrible labor-burdens of savage life; it gave her time and\r\n     strength to develop beauty of person and refinement of taste and\r\n     manners. It gave her the teaching capacity, for it put all the\r\n     younger child-life into her exclusive care, with some leisure at\r\n     command to devote to its mental and moral, as well as physical,\r\n     well-being. It led to a closer relationship between man and woman\r\n     than the world had known before, and thus gave each the advantage\r\n     of the other's qualities. And always and everywhere the\r\n     subjection of woman to man has had a mitigation and softening of\r\n     hardships unknown to other forms of slavery, by reason of the\r\n     power of human affection as it has worked through sex-attraction.\r\n     As soon, however, as the slavery of woman to man was outgrown and\r\n     obsolete it became (as was African slavery in a professedly\r\n     democratic country like our own) \"the sum of all villainies.\" And\r\n     to-day there is no inconsistency so great, and therefore no\r\n     condition so hurtful and outrageous, as the subjection of women\r\n     to men in a civilization which like ours assumes to rest upon\r\n     foundations of justice and equality of human rights....\r\n\r\n     To-day these considerations (especially the failure fully to\r\n     apply the doctrine of equality of human rights to women, even in\r\n     the most advanced centers of modern civilization) have an\r\n     especial and most fateful significance in relation to the women\r\n     of the more backward races as they are brought into contact with\r\n     our modern civilization. I said the peoples with whom we are now\r\n     being brought as a nation into vital relationship may be still in\r\n     the matriarchate. If they are not, most of them are certainly in\r\n     some transition stage from that to the father-rule. Not all\r\n     peoples have had to pass through the entire subjection of women\r\n     to men which marked our ancestral advance. The more persistent\r\n     tribal relationship and collective family life have sometimes\r\n     softened the process of social growth which was so harsh for\r\n     women under the old Roman law and the later English common law.\r\n     It may be that the dusky races of Africa and of the islands of\r\n     the sea, as well as our Aryan cousins of India, may pass more\r\n     easily through the stages of attachment of man's responsibility\r\n     to the family life than we, with our tough fiber of character,\r\n     were able to do. If so, in the name of justice they should have\r\n     the chance!\r\n\r\n     But if we, who have not yet \"writ large\" in law and political\r\n     rights that respect for woman which all our education, industry,\r\n     religion, art, home life and social culture express; if we, who\r\n     are still inconsistent and not yet out of the transition stage\r\n     from the father-rule to the equal reign of both sexes; if we lay\r\n     violent hands upon these backward peoples and give them only our\r\n     law and our political rights as they relate to women, we shall do\r\n     horrible injustice to the savage women, and through them to the\r\n     whole process of social growth for their people. When we tried to\r\n     divide \"in severalty\" the lands of the American Indian, we did\r\n     violence to all his own sense of justice and co-operative feeling\r\n     when we failed to recognize the women of the tribes in the\r\n     distribution. We then and there gave the Indian the worst of the\r\n     white man's relationship to his wife, and failed utterly, as in\r\n     the nature of the case we must have done, to give him the best of\r\n     the white man's relation to his wife.\r\n\r\n     When in India, as Mrs. Garrett Fawcett has so finely shown, we\r\n     introduce the technicalities of the English law of marriage to\r\n     bind an unwilling wife to her husband, we give the Hindoo the\r\n     slavery of the Anglo-Saxon wife, but we do not give him that\r\n     spirit of Anglo-Saxon marriage and home-life which has made that\r\n     slavery often scarcely felt, and never an unmixed evil. If,\r\n     to-day, in the Hawaiian Islands or in Cuba we fail to recognize\r\n     the native women, who still hold something of the primitive\r\n     prestige of womanhood, fail to recognize them as entitled to a\r\n     translation, under new laws and conditions, of the old dignity of\r\n     position, we shall not only do them an injustice, but we shall\r\n     forcibly give the Hawaiian and Cuban men lessons in the wrong\r\n     side and not the right side of our domestic relations. Above all,\r\n     if in the Philippines we abruptly and with force of arms\r\n     establish the authority of the husband over the wife, by\r\n     recognizing men only as property-owners, as signers of treaties,\r\n     as industrial rulers and as domestic law-givers, we shall\r\n     introduce every outrage and injustice of women's subjection to\r\n     men, without giving these people one iota of the sense of family\r\n     responsibility, of protection of and respect for woman, and of\r\n     deep and self-sacrificing devotion to childhood's needs, which\r\n     mark the Anglo-Saxon man.\r\n\r\n     In a word, if we introduce one particle of our belated and\r\n     illogical political and legal subjection of women to men into any\r\n     savage or half-civilized community, we shall spoil the domestic\r\n     virtues that community already possesses, and we shall not\r\n     (because we can not so abruptly and violently) inoculate them\r\n     with the virtues of civilized domestic life. Nature will not be\r\n     cheated. We can not escape, nor can we roughly and swiftly help\r\n     others to escape, the discipline of ages of natural growth.\r\n\r\n     This all means that we need another Commission to go to all the\r\n     lands in which our flag now claims a new power of oversight and\r\n     control--a Commission other than that so recently sent to the\r\n     Philippines--to see what may be done to bring order to that\r\n     distracted group of islands. We need a Commission which shall\r\n     study domestic rather than political conditions, and which shall\r\n     look for the undercurrents of social growth rather than the more\r\n     showy political movements. We should have on that Commission two\r\n     archæologists, a man and a woman, and I can name them--Otis T.\r\n     Mason and Alice C. Fletcher....\r\n\r\nAn earnest discussion followed this paper, in which Mrs. Clara Bewick\r\nColby (D. C.), Mrs. Helen Philleo Jenkins (Mich.), Henry B. Blackwell\r\n(Mass.), Miss Octavia W. Bates (Mich.), Miss Martha Scott Anderson\r\n(Minn.), and Miss Anthony took part:\r\n\r\n     MRS. JENKINS: ....Whatever power in government may be given to\r\n     the men of our new possessions in selecting their rulers, let the\r\n     same privilege be accorded the women. It may be said that the\r\n     women are ignorant, and need yet to be held in subjection--that\r\n     they are unfit to have a voice in the new order of things. Let us\r\n     not be deceived. Probably the women are no more ignorant and\r\n     stupid than the masses of men in these newly acquired\r\n     regions--excepting always the few men whom circumstances have\r\n     developed. The ignorant mother can guide her child quite as\r\n     safely as its ignorant father. Men and women in all nations and\r\n     tribes are pretty nearly on a level as to common sense and\r\n     forethought for the future good of the family. Indeed, the\r\n     interests of the home, protection of the children, and the morals\r\n     and behavior of the community make the standard of even\r\n     unlettered women one notch higher than that of their ignorant\r\n     husbands. Let us of this nation hesitate before we establish a\r\n     sex supremacy that it may take long centuries to overcome....\r\n\r\n     Thousands of dollars are expended on a military commission; it is\r\n     sent to investigate the commercial possibilities, the financial\r\n     opportunities, in remote lands; but the army, the commerce, the\r\n     finance are not all there is of a nation. There are more vital\r\n     interests--there is something which lies at the very base of the\r\n     nation, without which it could not exist--the homes, the women\r\n     and the children. It is the social conditions that need special\r\n     consideration in our country's dealings with these new lands.\r\n\r\n     MISS BATES: ....In the presence of the events which have\r\n     transpired during the past year, and in all the discussions\r\n     pertaining to the new peoples who have suddenly become our\r\n     protégés, seldom if ever does one hear a word about the women,\r\n     who, all will admit, are a most important factor in the\r\n     civilization--or the lack of it--which we have taken under our\r\n     control.\r\n\r\n     We women are here at this time to do our best to awaken the\r\n     public conscience to a realizing sense of the state of affairs.\r\n     We are the result of what the religion, the education of the\r\n     nineteenth century and the liberty which it has granted to women\r\n     have made us. We are ready and willing and competent to befriend\r\n     our less favored sisters beyond the seas, and to extend to them\r\n     the benefits we enjoy, so far as they are able to receive them;\r\n     but--the tragedy of it--in a certain sense we are utterly\r\n     helpless to reach them and to give them what they, unconsciously\r\n     to themselves, so grievously need. There is no place for the\r\n     thought of the women of this land in the plans of the nation for\r\n     the study of these questions.\r\n\r\n     No matter how much our speaker may think and write and publish on\r\n     this subject--aye, and women like her--no matter how wise the\r\n     conclusions they reach, is it at all likely that their voices\r\n     will be listened to in the din and blare and clash of warring\r\n     political parties, or respected in legislative halls? Or is it\r\n     probable that the advocates of territorial expansion will pause a\r\n     moment to ponder on the woman side of that question? We, to-day,\r\n     are discussing this subject without even the shadow of a hope of\r\n     putting our convictions into practice. Is it any wonder that\r\n     women at large are dead to the importance of this matter?...\r\n\r\n     I am in favor of pushing the question to the utmost--not that I\r\n     have any hope that such a Commission will be appointed, but\r\n     because it furnishes a most valuable argument for extending the\r\n     suffrage to women: first, in order that, by its possession, they\r\n     may have an uncontested, legally-defined right of serving on such\r\n     commissions; and, second, because of the opportunity it offers\r\n     for proving to the world the necessity of commissions like this\r\n     for settling questions and conditions of which women form a\r\n     central and integral part. Of course if we possessed the\r\n     suffrage, we should have no necessity for a discussion like the\r\n     present. Everything we are saying would seem like truisms then,\r\n     instead of being contested point by point, as it is to-day....\r\n\r\n     MR. BLACKWELL: ....In those islands are peoples ranging from\r\n     absolute savagery to mediæval civilization, from fighters with\r\n     blow-guns and bows and arrows to fighters with Mauser rifles and\r\n     modern artillery. Laws and institutions suited to the needs of\r\n     one tribe are unsuited to those of another. Side by side are\r\n     Catholicism, Mohammedanism and heathenism. Their amusements vary\r\n     from cannibalism to cock-fighting. Their social status ranges\r\n     from barbarous promiscuity to Moslem polygamy and thence to\r\n     Hindoo monogamy. But everywhere exist masculine domination and\r\n     feminine subjection, under varied forms of political despotism,\r\n     tempered with Protestant liberalism in the case of Hawaii. To\r\n     establish over all these diverse social conditions the rigid\r\n     principles of the English common law, which prevail largely in\r\n     our jurisprudence, will perpetuate and intensify the tyranny of\r\n     husband over wife, of father over offspring.\r\n\r\n     We see the consequences already in the British West Indies, where\r\n     negro women generally prefer to live outside of legal marriage\r\n     because as wives they find themselves subjected to practical\r\n     serfdom. In Jamaica 75 per cent. of the births are illegitimate\r\n     for this reason. When I visited Haiti, I was told to my great\r\n     surprise that the homes and small farms were usually owned by the\r\n     women. Expressing my admiration of this chivalrous recognition of\r\n     women's right to the homestead, I was informed that there was no\r\n     such sentiment. It was solely because the men were so lazy and\r\n     unreliable that the perpetuity of the race was endangered. The\r\n     fathers of the children were here to-day and away to-morrow. They\r\n     spent their time in loafing, drinking, gambling and plotting\r\n     \"revolutions.\" The women, anchored by the love for their\r\n     children, lived in the little huts on their small plantations,\r\n     raising yams and bananas, and if the men became too drunken and\r\n     abusive the women ordered them to leave. Among those people, in a\r\n     tropical climate, with land to squat upon, most of the work is\r\n     done by the women. Let no one imagine that the so-called\r\n     \"matriarchate\" of early ages was an ideal condition of society.\r\n     It was based primarily upon the industrial and moral\r\n     irresponsibility of men.\r\n\r\n     In our new possessions, side by side with these primitive\r\n     conditions, we have great bodies of Chinese and Hindoo coolies,\r\n     who represent ancient and fossilized types of civilized society,\r\n     patient, economical, industrious, monogamous and exclusive in\r\n     their family relations. The trouble is that where Western\r\n     civilization interferes with Oriental abuses it does not go far\r\n     enough. When in India the British government prohibited the\r\n     custom of burning widows on the funeral pyre of their deceased\r\n     husbands, widows became the slaves of their husband's relatives,\r\n     and were actually believed to be responsible for his death and\r\n     were ill treated accordingly. When infanticide was forbidden and\r\n     peace maintained, population multiplied until famine became\r\n     chronic. The only salvation for the women of our new possessions\r\n     lies in a legal recognition of their personal, industrial, social\r\n     and political equality. If, as seems too probable, their rights\r\n     shall be simply ignored in the reconstruction, women will suffer\r\n     all the disabilities of the law, without the practical\r\n     alleviations afforded by an enlightened public opinion. Such\r\n     women, even more than those of our own States, will need the\r\n     ballot as a means of self-protection....\r\n\r\n     MISS ANTHONY: I have been overflowing with wrath ever since the\r\n     proposal was made to engraft our half-barbaric form of government\r\n     on Hawaii and our other new possessions. I have been studying how\r\n     to save, not them, but ourselves from the disgrace. This is the\r\n     first time the United States has ever tried to foist upon a new\r\n     people the exclusively masculine form of government. Our business\r\n     should be to give this people the highest form which has been\r\n     attained by us. When our State governments were originally\r\n     formed, there was no example of woman suffrage anywhere, but now\r\n     we have a great deal of it, and everywhere it has done good. The\r\n     principle is constantly spreading....\r\n\r\n     We are told it will be of no use for us to ask this measure of\r\n     justice--that the ballot be given to the women of our new\r\n     possessions upon the same terms as to the men--because we shall\r\n     not get it. It is not our business whether we are going to get\r\n     it; our business is to make the demand. Suppose during these\r\n     fifty years we had asked only for what we thought we could\r\n     secure, where should we be now? Ask for the whole loaf and take\r\n     what you can get.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary L. Doe (Mich.), brought greetings from the American\r\nFederation of Labor. \"Woman suffrage would find its most hopeful and\r\nfertile field among the labor organizations,\" she said; \"the\r\nworkingmen stood for weak and defenseless women even before they did\r\nfor their own rights.\" From Samuel Gompers, president of the\r\nFederation, she read the following letter:\r\n\r\n     The American Federation of Labor, at every convention where the\r\n     subject has been brought up and discussed, has unfalteringly\r\n     declared for equal legal, political and economic rights for\r\n     women. At the convention held in Detroit, some thirteen years\r\n     ago, a resolution to that effect was unanimously adopted. A\r\n     petition to Congress for the submission of a constitutional\r\n     amendment enfranchising women was circulated among our various\r\n     unions, and within two months it received nearly 300,000\r\n     signatures and indorsements.\r\n\r\n     At the Kansas City convention last December, the question of\r\n     woman's work was discussed, and the following declaration was\r\n     unanimously adopted: \"In view of the awful conditions under which\r\n     woman is compelled to toil, this, the eighteenth annual\r\n     convention of the American Federation of Labor, strongly urges\r\n     the more general formation of trade unions of wage-working women,\r\n     to the end that they may scientifically and permanently abolish\r\n     the terrible evils accompanying their weakened, because\r\n     unorganized state; and we emphatically reiterate the trade-union\r\n     demand that women receive equal compensation for equal service\r\n     performed.\"\r\n\r\n     You will see that there ought to be no question as to the\r\n     attitude of the organized labor movement on this subject,\r\n     notwithstanding the designing misrepresentations of enemies of\r\n     our cause, who seek to place our movement in a false light. Let\r\n     me say, too, that the declaration just quoted is not for\r\n     compliment merely, for members of many of our organizations have\r\n     been involved in long and sacrificing contests in order to secure\r\n     to women equal pay for equal work. Please convey fraternal\r\n     greetings to our friends who will meet at Grand Rapids.\r\n\r\nWhen Mrs. Loraine Immen came forward with a greeting from the Michigan\r\nElocutionists' Association, Miss Anthony spoke of the great change\r\nwhich had taken place in women's voices in the last twenty-five years.\r\nAt an early Woman's Rights Convention, when she insisted that they\r\nshould speak louder, one of them answered, \"We are not here to\r\nscreech; we are here to be ladies.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Lillie Devereux Blake (N. Y.) spoke entertainingly on The Hope of\r\nthe Future:\r\n\r\n     The lessons of the past year have brought home to many of us more\r\n     forcibly than any other recent events the injustice and cruelty\r\n     of denying to women their proper share in deciding questions for\r\n     the public good. We have seen the republic plunged into war in\r\n     which women have borne a heavy share of the burdens. It should be\r\n     the rule of all nations that no contest of arms should be entered\r\n     into without the consent of the women....\r\n\r\n     Another significant object lesson grew out of the war. When the\r\n     time of election approached, the governmental authorities became\r\n     much exercised over the means of providing for the voting of the\r\n     soldiers. It is astonishing how much men think of their own right\r\n     to vote. Extra sessions of the Legislatures were called to\r\n     provide means of meeting this emergency. In this dilemma I\r\n     ventured to write to the Governor of my State and suggest that he\r\n     recommend the passing of a law empowering each soldier and sailor\r\n     to send to some woman at home a proxy permitting her to vote for\r\n     him. You can see how simple a plan this would be. Every man would\r\n     have a beloved mother, a dear sister or some adored damsel whom\r\n     he would be proud to have represent him at the polls, and the\r\n     amount of money which this scheme would have saved to the State\r\n     is enormous. The counting of the soldiers' votes when at last\r\n     they were sent to New York cost hundreds of thousands of dollars.\r\n     In one instance, in a certain county where the board of\r\n     supervisors had to be called together in two special sessions and\r\n     the county officials summoned as if at a regular election, to\r\n     count six votes, the amount reached $100 per vote!\r\n\r\nMiss Frances A. Griffin (Ala.), a new speaker on the national\r\nplatform, captured the audience with her rich voice and southern\r\nintonation as she discussed The Effects of Our Teaching:\r\n\r\n     The thanksgiving of the old Jew, \"Lord, I thank Thee that Thou\r\n     didst not make me a woman,\" doubtless came from a careful review\r\n     of the situation. Like all of us, he had fortitude enough to bear\r\n     his neighbors' afflictions....\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony deals recklessly with years, apportioning them to\r\n     her friends as liberally as Napoleon dealt out kingdoms and\r\n     duchies to his brothers and other relations. Her example has\r\n     strengthened me; you never would have had this next remark but\r\n     for Miss Anthony: Thirty-five years ago I read a graduating\r\n     essay. I knew I was doing an unwomanly thing, and in order to\r\n     preserve what little womanliness I might have left, when I got up\r\n     to read it I whispered the whole essay. I've quit that. Since I\r\n     made up my mind to be heard, I have been heard.... A great\r\n     progress of women has gone on and is going on. Men for the most\r\n     part are manageable; women are the converts needed. When women\r\n     have their minds made up to vote, it will be with them as it was\r\n     with me about being heard....\r\n\r\n     This is a new era for woman. If the larger sphere now open to her\r\n     is not a new discovery, it is at least a new testament. The day\r\n     will come that people will look back with shame on the time when\r\n     brains and virtue were shut away from the ballot-box, if they\r\n     belonged to a woman....\r\n\r\nMiss Anna Caulfield (Mich.) pointed out The Achievements of Woman in\r\nArt. Mrs. May Wright Sewall (Ind.) spoke eloquently on The True\r\nCivilization of the World, saying in part:\r\n\r\n     In the new civilization the sense of personal responsibility is\r\n     strong; it respects the child's individuality and also recognizes\r\n     the unity of all educational agencies--kindergarten, school,\r\n     college and university.\r\n\r\n     There is also a new theology, in which individual conscience is\r\n     substituted for the dictates of authority, and which\r\n     distinguishes between metaphysical doctrine and practical\r\n     principle. It seeks the higher unity, all embracing.\r\n\r\n     The new political economy recognizes the right of the individual,\r\n     and the body politic as composed of units, each one of which must\r\n     be respected. Its whole effort is to preserve the rights of\r\n     employers and to give equal recognition to the employed; to unify\r\n     all those classes that have heretofore been kept divided.\r\n\r\n     The new civilization results from all these. The difficulties in\r\n     realizing this perfect unit arise from selfishness. We have long\r\n     recognized that individual selfishness is a defect, but national\r\n     selfishness has been for a long time extolled under the name of\r\n     patriotism, and has gone on cleaving great chasms between\r\n     different peoples. In the new civilization the individual will\r\n     recognize himself at his best in his relation to the whole. The\r\n     different professions will recognize that what each contributes\r\n     bears but a small ratio to what each receives from the rest. The\r\n     different nationalities will recognize their respective dignities\r\n     in just the proportion in which the whole must transcend any\r\n     part. Then humanity will exceed national feeling and the unity of\r\n     the race will exalt the dignity of the individual.\r\n\r\nThe resolution presented by Mrs. Sewall, member for the United States\r\nof the International Peace Union, rejoicing over the approaching Peace\r\nConference at The Hague and assuring the commissioners from the United\r\nStates of the sympathy of the women of this country, was unanimously\r\nadopted.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, national vice-president, whose childhood\r\nand early girlhood had been spent in Michigan, closed the Saturday\r\nevening meeting with a tender address on Working Partners, a graphic\r\ndescription of the pioneer days of this State and the hardships of\r\nits women, during which she said: \"Women have been faithful partners\r\nand have done their full share of the work. A gentleman opposed to\r\ntheir enfranchisement once said to me, 'Women have never produced\r\nanything of any value to the world.' I told him the chief product of\r\nthe women had been the men, and left it to him to decide whether the\r\nproduct was of any value. Is it said that women must not vote because\r\nthey can not bear arms? Why, women's arms have borne all the\r\narm-bearers of the world. We have no antique art in America, but we\r\nhave antique laws. We do not look back to the antiquity of the world,\r\nbut to the babyhood of the world. Who would think of calling a\r\nnew-born infant antique? Yet laws made in the babyhood of the world\r\nare in this day of its manhood quoted for our guidance. Much has been\r\nsaid lately about 'the white man's burden', but the white man will\r\nnever have a heavier burden to take up than himself.\"\r\n\r\nTwelve churches offered their pulpits, which were filled by the women\r\nspeakers Sunday morning.[117] The regular convention services were\r\nheld Sunday afternoon in the St. Cecilia building, a large audience\r\nbeing present. The Rev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell led the devotional\r\nexercises, and the Rev. Florence Kollock Crooker gave the sermon from\r\nthe text: \"Whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it;\r\nor one member be honored, all the members rejoice with it.\" Afterwards\r\nMrs. Sewall spoke on the coming Peace Congress at The Hague and, on\r\nmotion of Melvin A. Root, a resolution was adopted that on May 15, the\r\nopening day of the congress, the women of our country assemble in\r\npublic and send to it the voice of women in favor of peace.\r\n\r\nA touching letter from Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton was read by Miss\r\nAnthony during the convention, in which she said: \"We seem to be\r\npariahs alike in the visible and the invisible world, with no foothold\r\nanywhere, though by every principle of government and religion we\r\nshould have an equal place on this planet. We do not hold the ignorant\r\nclass of men responsible for these outrages against women, but rather\r\nthe published opinions of men in high positions, judges, bishops,\r\npresidents of colleges, editors, novelists and poets--all taught by\r\nthe common and civil law. It is a sad reflection that the chains of\r\nwoman's bondage have been forged by her own sires and sons. Every man\r\nwho is not for us in this prolonged struggle for liberty is\r\nresponsible for the present degradation of the mothers of the race. It\r\nis pitiful to see how few men ever have made our cause their own, but\r\nwhile leaving us to fight our battle alone, they have been unsparing\r\nin their criticism of every failure. Of all the battles for liberty in\r\nthe long past, woman only has been left to fight her own, without help\r\nand with all the powers of earth and heaven, human and divine, arrayed\r\nagainst her.\"\r\n\r\nMonday evening Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, national treasurer, told of\r\nAn Ohio Woman's Experience as Member of a School Board. She gave a\r\nlively account of her own nomination and election in Warren, and said\r\nin concluding: \"It was not a war of women against men, but of\r\nliberalism against conservatism, of principle against prejudice, of\r\nthe new against the old. It does not take any more time to clean up a\r\nschoolhouse and keep out scarlet fever than it does to nurse the\r\nchildren through the scarlet fever.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Flora Beadle Renkes, School Commissioner of Barry County, Mich.,\r\ndescribed Some Phases of Public School Work. She advocated industrial\r\nand moral as well as intellectual training and all of this equally for\r\nboth sexes.\r\n\r\nMrs. Minerva Welch, in considering Woman's Possibilities, said: \"To my\r\nmind it is given to woman to develop the greatest possibilities in all\r\nthe world. She can direct the character of generations. If woman ever\r\ngains the place God intended her to have it must be through the mother\r\nelement. In Denver we have organized women's clubs for the study of\r\nart, literature and political science. We have learned to fraternize.\r\nMen have found that women bring their moral influence into politics,\r\nand the men also know that they must look to their own morals if they\r\nwant office. Many questions have been sent to our State asking about\r\nthe new conditions. Woman suffrage has proved a success, and the women\r\ncan stand with heads erect, shoulder to shoulder with any one, knowing\r\nthat they are full, free citizens of the State of Colorado and of the\r\nUnited States.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony then, by special request, gave a recital of all the facts\r\nconnected with her arrest, trial and conviction for voting in 1872.\r\nMiss Shaw introduced her as a criminal, and Miss Anthony retorted,\r\n\"Yes, a criminal out of jail, just like a good many of the brethren.\"\r\nWith marvelous power she recalled all the details of that dramatic\r\nepisode.\r\n\r\nMrs. Abigail Scott Duniway (Ore.) gave an address on How to Win the\r\nBallot, containing much sound sense. It was published in full by the\r\nGrand Rapids _Democrat_. Mrs. Evelyn H. Belden, president of the Iowa\r\nEqual Suffrage Association, spoke on Women and War, saying:\r\n\r\n     Did you ever have to live with heroes--with men who have survived\r\n     the hardships and dangers of war? One of the reasons for my\r\n     mildness in public is that I have to be mild at home. I live with\r\n     the heroes of two wars. The elder put down the rebellion--so he\r\n     tells me. The younger, for whom I am responsible, has\r\n     accomplished an even more perilous feat; he met in mortal combat\r\n     every day for six months the product of the commissary department\r\n     of our late war. He is still alive, but \"kicking\"--and so is his\r\n     mother!\r\n\r\n     Note that there were no women on the War Investigating\r\n     Commission. Brutal officers, incompetent quartermasters and\r\n     ignorant doctors were tried before a jury of their peers. Every\r\n     department which was conducted without the help of women has been\r\n     for months writhing under the probe of an official investigation,\r\n     and is still writhing under the lash of public opinion.\r\n\r\n     When the war broke out, the women of Iowa, with the suffragists\r\n     at their head, cheerfully consecrated themselves to the service\r\n     of a State which does not recognize them as the equals of their\r\n     own boys. I have one old trunk that made six trips to Chickamauga\r\n     Park, filled with delicacies for the soldiers. About August I\r\n     made up my mind to go and see things for myself. My husband was\r\n     told it was no place for a woman there among 60,000 men and 1,500\r\n     animals; but he had business at home which he did not think I\r\n     could attend to, and he thought I could go to Chickamauga just as\r\n     well as he....\r\n\r\n     If there had been women on the commission, would they have\r\n     pitched the camp five miles from water? Or provided only one\r\n     horse and one mule to bring the water for two companies? Or\r\n     ordered the soldiers to filter and boil their drinking water,\r\n     without furnishing any filters or any vessels to boil it in? It\r\n     is said that suffragists do not know how to keep house. If so,\r\n     the men who managed the war must all be suffragists.\r\n\r\n     But Clara Barton and the women nurses have won golden opinions\r\n     from every one. If any man had given a tithe of what Helen Gould\r\n     did, he could have had any office in the gift of the\r\n     administration. So could she, if she had been a voter. She might\r\n     even have been Secretary of War.\r\n\r\n     We raise our sons to die not for their country--no woman grudges\r\n     her sons to her country--but to die unnecessarily of disease and\r\n     neglect, because of red tape....\r\n\r\n     History furnishes no parallel to the women of America during the\r\n     last year's war. They were fully alive to its issues,\r\n     intelligently conversant with its causes, its purposes and\r\n     possibilities; they studied camp locations, conditions and\r\n     military rules; and through the hand the heart found constant\r\n     expression, as many a company of grateful boys can testify. The\r\n     experience of this war ought to have effectually destroyed the\r\n     last trace of mediæval sentiment concerning the propriety of\r\n     women mixing in the affairs of government, and also the last\r\n     shadow of doubt as to the expediency of recognizing them as\r\n     voters.\r\n\r\nMrs. Josephine K. Henry (Ky.) made an address sparkling with the\r\nepigrams for which she was noted, entitled A Plea for the Ballot:\r\n\r\n     ....The light and the eager interest in the faces of American\r\n     women show that they are going somewhere; and when women have\r\n     started for somewhere, they are harder to head off than a\r\n     comet.... All roads for women lead to suffrage, even if they do\r\n     not know it. We are Daughters of Evolution, and who can stop old\r\n     Dame Evolution?... We must live up to our principles, or, as a\r\n     nation, we are not going to live at all. Then it will be time for\r\n     Liberty to throw down her torch, and go out of the enlightening\r\n     business.... \"Woman's sphere\"--these are the two hardest-worked\r\n     words in the dictionary.... They call in the mental and moral\r\n     wreckage of foreign nations to help rule us. A man was asked,\r\n     \"How are you going to vote on the constitution?\" He answered: \"My\r\n     constitution's mighty poorly; my mother was feeble before me.\"\r\n     There is deep tragedy in giving such men control of the lives and\r\n     property of American women.... There is not so much the matter\r\n     with the U. S. Constitution as with the constitutions of some of\r\n     our statesmen.... It is not an expansion of territory that we\r\n     need so much as an expansion of justice to our own women....\r\n     American men have had a hard struggle for their own liberty, and\r\n     some of them are afraid there will not be liberty enough to go\r\n     around.... What relation is woman to the State? She is a very\r\n     poor relation, yet her tax-money is demanded promptly.\r\n\r\nDr. Mary H. Barker Bates, of the Denver School Board, discussed Our\r\nGains and Our Losses, and said in closing: \"We have learned that in\r\npolitics we must have a machine, only it should be used for good\r\ngovernment, not for corruption. Make your machine as perfect as you\r\ncan, without a flaw in it anywhere, and then use it for good ends.\"\r\nMrs. Mary B. Clay (Ky.) gave a careful survey of conditions resulting\r\nfrom The Removal of Industries from the Home, which had forced woman\r\nto follow them and made her an industrial factor in the outside world.\r\nMiss Griffin being again called on told these anecdotes:\r\n\r\n     In my home in Alabama there are four educated women. My father\r\n     has passed away. My sisters are widows and I am an old maid. We\r\n     have as our gardener a negro boy twenty-three years old. When he\r\n     came to us he said that he had been in the Second Reader for ten\r\n     years, but on election day he goes over and votes to represent\r\n     our family. If we complain of having no vote on the expenditure\r\n     of our tax-money, we are told we must \"influence\" men; in other\r\n     words, we must influence that gardener. But when we start to do\r\n     so, and ask him how he means to vote, he says he doesn't know\r\n     yet, because he hasn't seen \"Uncle Peter,\" the colored minister.\r\n\r\n     In my section men are chivalric and say, \"Don't you know that you\r\n     shall have everything you ask as ladies? Don't you know that we\r\n     are your natural protectors?\" But what is a woman afraid of on a\r\n     lonely road after dark? The bears and wolves are all gone; there\r\n     is nothing to be afraid of now but our natural protectors.\r\n\r\n     On the islands off our coast there was a large population that\r\n     could not read or write. A missionary-spirited woman went there\r\n     to help educate them. After awhile she was made a member of the\r\n     school board, which consisted of a few white men and more\r\n     negroes. The president of the board, a colored man, was disgusted\r\n     at the elevation of a woman to that dignity, and when she was\r\n     sworn in he resigned, saying, \"Now you've swore her in, you've\r\n     got to swear me out; I'm not going to sit on no board with no\r\n     woman.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the convention Miss Anthony made an earnest appeal for\r\nco-operation in the equal suffrage work, saying: \"Why is it the duty\r\nof the little handful on this platform to be talking and working for\r\nthe enfranchisement of women any more than that of all of you who sit\r\nhere to-night? Every woman can do something for the cause. She who is\r\ntrue to it at her own fireside, who speaks the right word to her\r\nguests, to her children and her neighbors' children, does an\r\neducational work as valuable as that of the woman who speaks from the\r\nplatform.\" She also urged a wider reading of the equal rights papers,\r\nthe _Woman's Journal_, _Tribune_, _Standard_, _Wisconsin Citizen_,\r\netc., and suffrage pamphlets and leaflets. She defended herself\r\nagainst the accusation of abusing the men, saying, \"We have not been\r\nfighting the 'male' citizen anywhere but in the statute books.\"\r\n\r\nEighty-seven delegates representing twenty-two States were present at\r\nthis convention. The treasurer reported the receipts of the past year\r\nto be $14,020. Mrs. Chapman Catt, chairman of the Organization\r\nCommittee, related the work done by the suffrage organizations in\r\nbehalf of the Spanish-American War. She described also the efforts\r\nmade to obtain suffrage for women in the new constitution of Louisiana\r\nthe preceding year, which resulted in securing the franchise for\r\ntaxpaying women on all matters submitted to taxpayers. The work in\r\ndifferent States and Territories, especially in Arizona and Oklahoma,\r\nwas sketched in detail, and will be found in their respective\r\nchapters.\r\n\r\nIn concluding her report as chairman of the Legislative Committee,\r\nMrs. Blake called attention to the more hopeful character of this\r\nrecord as compared to that of last year, and urged upon all State\r\npresidents the importance of having some one to represent the\r\ninterests of women constantly at their capitals during the legislative\r\nsessions, not only to secure favorable legislation but to prevent that\r\ninimical to their interests, citing the case of New Mexico, where a\r\nlaw which infringes on the right of dower was recently passed without\r\nthe knowledge of women.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elnora M. Babcock (N. Y.) was made chairman of National Press\r\nWork, with power to appoint a chairman in each State. The customary\r\ntelegram of congratulation and appreciation was sent to the honorary\r\npresident, Mrs. Stanton. Mrs. Eliza Wright Osborne (N. Y.) was\r\nappointed fraternal delegate to the International Council of Women to\r\nmeet in London in June. Greetings were received through fraternal\r\ndelegates, Mrs. Jessie R. Denney, from the Ancient Order of United\r\nWorkingmen, and Mrs. Emma A. Wheeler from the Canadian W. C. T. U. The\r\nletter to Miss Anthony from its president, Mrs. Annie O. Rutherford,\r\nsaid: \"A vigorous campaign is being carried on in every Province in\r\nfavor of equal suffrage, with fair hope of success in most of them. We\r\nwish for your convention a most successful issue, and that your life,\r\nwhose grand pioneer work has made it easy for those who follow after,\r\nmay be spared many years yet to help broaden the path and uplift the\r\ncause of humanity.\" Many letters and telegrams were received from\r\nState suffrage associations and from individuals. Mrs. Belva A.\r\nLockwood (D. C.) wrote: \"As a delegate to the ninth annual convention\r\nof the International League of Press Clubs just held in Baltimore, I\r\nsucceeded in gaining recognition on equal terms for women journalists\r\nin the space to be allotted to men journalists in the Exposition at\r\nParis in 1900.\"\r\n\r\nA lively discussion was caused by a resolution offered by Mrs. Lottie\r\nWilson Jackson, a delegate from Michigan, so light-complexioned as\r\nhardly to suggest a tincture of African blood, that \"colored women\r\nought not be compelled to ride in smoking cars, and that suitable\r\naccommodations should be provided for them.\" It was finally tabled as\r\nbeing outside the province of the convention.[118]\r\n\r\nThe memorial resolutions were presented by the Rev. Antoinette Brown\r\nBlackwell, who said: \"These tributes are largely to older men and\r\nwomen with whom I was associated long ago and it is a pleasure to\r\nrecall their noble services to humanity in times when they and their\r\nwork were far more unpopular than to-day. There are twenty-five on my\r\nlist, yet I think there was only one of the entire number who was not\r\nmore than fifty years old, and most of them reached on toward the\r\neighties and nineties. All were earnest advocates of equal suffrage,\r\nbut there were kindred causes to which most of them were also\r\ndevoted.... Laura P. Haviland spent seventy years of her life in\r\nMichigan, the last five here in Grand Rapids. At one time she assumed\r\nthe care of nine orphan children; at another, during the Civil War she\r\nwas the active agent who freed from prison a large number of Union\r\nsoldiers held upon false charges. She labored for every good cause and\r\nwas a simple Quaker in religion and life....\r\n\r\n\"Parker Pillsbury of New Hampshire, who died last year, aged 88, known\r\nas a life-long worker for the oppressed before the Civil War, gave\r\nmuch of his energy to the cause of anti-slavery. When that noble\r\nphilanthropy was split in two throughout its whole length because\r\none-half would not let women serve on committees with men or raise\r\ntheir voices publicly for those who were dumb and helpless, Parker\r\nPillsbury stood by the side of Abby Kelly and the Grimké sisters. His\r\nterse, characteristic, uncompromising language, his cheerful braving\r\nof prejudice, his sympathetic claim for justice to womanhood, made him\r\none of the noblest of men....\r\n\r\n\"In the long and many-sided history of the woman's cause, Mrs. Matilda\r\nJoslyn Gage made a deep and lasting mark. I recall her as she came\r\nfirst upon our platform at the Syracuse Woman's Rights Convention in\r\n1852, a young mother of two children, yet with a heart also for a\r\nwider cause. Wendell Phillips said of her then, 'She came to us an\r\nunknown woman. She leaves us a co-worker whose reputation is\r\nestablished.' ...\r\n\r\n\"The Hon. Nelson W. Dingley was able officially to help our movement\r\nwith efficient good-will. His vote was recorded for the admission of\r\nStates with a woman suffrage constitution.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Blackwell paid personal tribute to most of those who had passed\r\naway, and Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby continued the memorial, speaking at\r\nlength of the splendid work of Mrs. Gage; of Mrs. Flora M. Kimball and\r\nMrs. Abigail Bush, of California--but early Eastern pioneers; Mrs.\r\nSarah M. Kimball of Utah; Mrs. Frances Bagley and Dr. Charlotte\r\nLevanway of Michigan; and a long list of men and women in various\r\nStates who had done their part in aiding the cause of equal suffrage.\r\nShe concluded with eloquent words of appreciation of the services of\r\nRobert Purvis of Philadelphia, and presented the following resolutions\r\nsent by Mrs. Stanton:\r\n\r\n     During the period of reconstruction, the popular cry was, \"This\r\n     is the negro's hour,\" and Republicans and Abolitionists alike\r\n     insisted that woman's claim to the suffrage must be held in\r\n     abeyance until the negro was safe beyond peradventure.\r\n     Distinguished politicians, lawyers and congressmen declared that\r\n     woman as well as the negro was enfranchised by the Fourteenth\r\n     Amendment, yet reformers and politicians denounced those women\r\n     who would not keep silent, while the Republican and anti-slavery\r\n     press ignored their demands altogether. In this dark hour of\r\n     woman's struggle, forsaken by all those who once recognized her\r\n     civil and political rights, two noble men steadfastly maintained\r\n     that it was not only woman's right but her duty to push her\r\n     claims while the constitutional door was open and the rights of\r\n     citizens in a republic were under discussion; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That women owe a debt of gratitude to Robert Purvis\r\n     and Parker Pillsbury for their fearless advocacy of our cause,\r\n     when to do so was considered to be treason to a great party\r\n     measure, involving life and liberty for the colored race.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That in the death of men of such exalted virtue, true\r\n     to principle under the most trying circumstances, sacrificing the\r\n     ties of friendship and the respect of their compeers, they are\r\n     conspicuous as the moral heroes of the nineteenth century.\r\n\r\nThe memorial service was closed with prayer by the Rev. Anna Howard\r\nShaw, who voiced the gratitude for the inspiration of such lives as\r\nthese and the hope that this generation might carry the work on to its\r\nfull fruition.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe keynote to the speeches and action of this convention was the\r\nstatus of women in our new possessions. At a preliminary meeting of\r\nthe Business Committee, held in the home of Mrs. Chapman Catt at\r\nBensonhurst-by-the-Sea, N. Y., Jan. 2, 1899, the following \"open\r\nletter\" had been prepared and sent to every member of Congress:\r\n\r\n     TO THE SENATE AND HOUSE OF REPRESENTATIVES: We respectfully\r\n     request that in the qualifications for voters in the proposed\r\n     Constitution for the new Territory of Hawaii the word \"male\" be\r\n     omitted.\r\n\r\n     The declared intention of the United States in annexing the\r\n     Hawaiian Islands is to give them the benefits of the most\r\n     advanced civilization, and it is a truism that the progress of\r\n     civilization in every country is measured by the approach of\r\n     women toward the ideal of equal rights with men.\r\n\r\n     Under barbarism the struggle for existence is entirely on the\r\n     physical plane. The woman freely enters the arena and her failure\r\n     or success depends wholly upon her own strength. When life rises\r\n     to the intellectual plane public opinion is expressed in law.\r\n     Justice demands that we shall not offer to women emerging from\r\n     barbarism the ball and chain of a sex disqualification while we\r\n     hold out to men the crown of self-government.\r\n\r\n     The trend of civilization is closely in the direction of equal\r\n     rights for women. [Then followed a list of the gains for woman\r\n     suffrage.]\r\n\r\n     The Hon. John D. Long, Secretary of the Navy, calls the\r\n     opposition to woman suffrage a \"slowly melting glacier of\r\n     bourbonism and prejudice\". The melting is going on steadily all\r\n     over our country, and it would be most inopportune to impose upon\r\n     our new possessions abroad the antiquated restrictions which we\r\n     are fast discarding at home.\r\n\r\n     We, therefore, petition your Honorable Body that, upon whatever\r\n     conditions and qualifications the right of suffrage is granted to\r\n     Hawaiian men, it shall be granted to Hawaiian women.[119]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding this appeal, and special petitions also from the\r\nSuffrage Associations of the forty-five States, our Congress provided\r\na constitution in which the word \"male\" was introduced more frequently\r\nthan in the Constitution of the United States or of any State, in the\r\ndetermination to bar out Hawaiian women from voting and holding\r\noffice. It was declared that only \"male\" citizens should fill any\r\noffice or vote for any officer, a sweeping restriction which is not\r\nmade in a single State of our Union. Not satisfied with this infamous\r\nabuse of power, our Congress refused to this new Territory a privilege\r\nenjoyed by every other Territory in the United States--that of having\r\nthe power vested in its Legislature to grant woman suffrage--and\r\nprovided that this Territorial Legislature must submit the question to\r\nthe voters. It took care, however, to enfranchise every male being in\r\nthe Islands--Kanaka, Japanese and Portuguese--and it will be only by\r\ntheir permission that even the American and English women residing\r\nthere ever can possess the suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe members of the commission who drafted this constitution were\r\nPresident Sanford B. Dole and Associate Justice W. F. Frear of Hawaii;\r\nSenators John T. Morgan, Ala.; Shelby M. Cullom, Ills.; Representative\r\nRobert R. Hitt, Ills. Justice Frear said over his own signature, Feb.\r\n11, 1899: \"I proposed at a meeting of the Hawaiian Commission that the\r\nLegislature be permitted to authorize woman suffrage, and President\r\nDole supported me, but the other members of the commission took a\r\ndifferent view.\" In other words, the Hawaiian members favored the\r\nenfranchisement of their women but were overruled by the American\r\nmembers. If but one of the latter had stood by those from Hawaii its\r\nwomen would not have been placed, as they now are, under greater\r\nsubjection even than those of the United States, and far greater than\r\nthey were before the annexation of the Islands. Yet after the\r\nconsummation of this shameful act the world was asked to rejoice over\r\nthe creation of a new republic!\r\n\r\nThere is not the slightest reason to hope that the appeals for justice\r\nto the women of the Philippines will meet with any greater success, as\r\nit is the policy of our Government to give to men every incentive to\r\nstudy its institutions and fit themselves for an intelligent voice in\r\ntheir control, but to discourage all interest on the part of women and\r\nto prevent them absolutely from any participation. Having held\r\nAmerican women in subjection for a century and a quarter, it now shows\r\na determination to place the same handicap upon the women of our\r\nnewly-acquired possessions.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the spring of 1902, just before this volume goes to the\r\npublishers, the U. S. Senate Philippine Commission has been summoning\r\nbefore it a number of persons competent to give expert testimony as to\r\nexisting conditions in those Islands. Among these were Judge W. H.\r\nTaft, who for the past year has been Governor of the Philippines and\r\nspeaks with high authority; and Archbishop Nozaleda, who has been\r\nconnected with the Catholic church in the Islands for twenty-six\r\nyears, and Archbishop since 1889, and who has the fullest\r\nunderstanding of the natives. Governor Taft said in answer to the\r\ncommittee:\r\n\r\n     The fact is that, not only among the Tagalogs but also among the\r\n     Christian Filipinos, the woman is the active manager of the\r\n     family, so if you expect to confer political power on the\r\n     Filipinos it ought to be given to the women.\r\n\r\nArchbishop Nozaleda testified as follows: (Senate Document 190, p.\r\n109.)\r\n\r\n     The woman is better than the man in every way--in intelligence,\r\n     in virtue and in labor--and a great deal more economical. She is\r\n     very much given to trade and trafficking. If any rights and\r\n     privileges are to be granted to the natives, do not give them to\r\n     the men but to the women.\r\n\r\n     Q. Then you think it would be much better to give the women the\r\n     right to vote than the men?\r\n\r\n     A. O, much better. Why, even in the fields it is the women who do\r\n     the work; the men who go to the cock fights and gamble. The woman\r\n     is the one who supports the man there; so every law of justice\r\n     demands that even in political life they should have the\r\n     privilege over the men.\r\n\r\nThe action which our Government will eventually take in conferring the\r\nsuffrage on the Filipinos can not be recorded in this volume, but the\r\nprophecy is here made that, in spite of the above testimony, and much\r\nmore of the same nature which has been given by correspondents in the\r\nPhilippines and by many who have returned from there, the Government\r\nof the United States will enfranchise the inferior male inhabitants\r\nand hold as political subjects the superior women of these Islands.\r\nAnd again the world will be called upon to greet another republic!\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[117] Miss Anthony spoke to a crowded house in the Fountain Street\r\nBaptist Church on The Moral Influence of Women, and the Rev. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw to another great audience in the Park Congregational\r\nChurch from the text, \"Only be thou strong and very courageous.\"\r\nCalvary Baptist Church was filled to overflowing to hear Miss Laura\r\nClay on The Bible for Equal Rights.

Textor at All Souls, and Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton and\r\nvarious members of the convention in other pulpits.\r\n\r\n[118] The following resolutions were adopted:\r\n\r\nThat we reaffirm our devotion to the immortal principle that\r\ngovernments derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,\r\nand we call for its application in the case of women citizens.\r\n\r\nWe protest against the introduction of the word \"male\" in the suffrage\r\nclause of the proposed Constitution of Hawaii, and declare that upon\r\nwhatever terms the franchise may be granted to men, it should be\r\ngranted also to women.\r\n\r\nIn all the great questions of war and peace, currency, tariff and\r\ntaxation, annexation of foreign territory and alien races, women are\r\nvitally interested and should have an equal expression at the ballot\r\nbox, and we recommend to the President of the United States the\r\nappointment of a committee of women to investigate the condition of\r\nwomen in our new island territories.\r\n\r\nWe congratulate the women of Ireland who have just voted for the first\r\ntime for municipal and county officers, and we call attention to the\r\nfact that 75 per cent. of the qualified women voted, and that the\r\ndispatches say they discharged their duty in a serious and\r\nbusinesslike spirit, with a keen eye to the personal merits of\r\ncandidates.\r\n\r\nWe congratulate the women of Colorado, whose Legislature lately passed\r\na resolution testifying to the good effects of equal suffrage by a\r\nvote of 45 to 3 in the House, and 30 to 1 in the Senate.\r\n\r\nWe congratulate the women of New Orleans, who are about to vote for\r\nthe first time, on a tax levy for sewerage and drainage, and we\r\ncommend their patriotic activity in collecting the signatures of 2,000\r\ntaxpaying women of that city in behalf of clean streets and a pure\r\nwater supply.\r\n\r\nWe congratulate the women of France, who have just voted for the first\r\ntime for judges of tribunals of commerce, and we call attention to the\r\nfact that in Paris, of the qualified voters, men and women taken\r\ntogether, only 14 per cent. voted, but of the women 30 per cent.\r\nvoted.\r\n\r\nWe congratulate the women of Kansas on the increased municipal vote of\r\nApril, 1899, over the entire State, Kansas City alone registering\r\n4,800 women and casting over 3,000 women's votes at the municipal\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nWe thank the House of Representatives of Oklahoma for its vote of 14\r\nto 9, and of Arizona for its vote of 19 to 5, for woman suffrage, and\r\nregret that the question did not reach the Councils of these\r\nTerritories.\r\n\r\nWe thank the Legislature of California for its enactment, with only\r\none dissenting vote in the House and six in the Senate, of a school\r\nsuffrage law (which failed to receive the approval of the Governor),\r\nalso we thank the Legislatures of Connecticut and Ohio, which have\r\ndefeated bills to repeal the existing school suffrage laws of those\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nWe thank the legislators of Oregon who have just submitted an\r\namendment granting suffrage to women by a vote of 48 to 6 in the House\r\nand 25 to 1 in the Senate, and we hope that Oregon will add a fifth\r\nstar to our equal suffrage flag.\r\n\r\nThis association is non sectarian and non partisan, and asks for the\r\nballot not for the sake of advancing any specific measure, but as a\r\nmatter of justice to the whole human family. In all the States where\r\nequal suffrage campaigns are pending we advise women and men to base\r\ntheir plea on the ground of clear and obvious justice, and not to\r\nindulge in predictions as to what women will do with the ballot before\r\nit is secured.\r\n\r\nWe protest against women being counted in the basis of representation\r\nof State and nation so long as they are not permitted to vote for\r\ntheir representatives.\r\n\r\nWe appreciate the friendly attitude of the American Federation of\r\nLabor, the National Grange and other public bodies of voters, as shown\r\nby their resolutions indorsing the legal, political and economic\r\nequality of women.\r\n\r\nWe rejoice in the Peace Congress about to meet at The Hague, and hope\r\nit may be preliminary to the establishment of international\r\narbitration.\r\n\r\n[119] See also Chap. XXIII for further efforts to protect the women of\r\nHawaii.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XX.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL-AMERICAN CONVENTION OF 1900.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Thirty-second annual convention of the suffrage association, held\r\nin Washington, D. C., Feb. 8-14, 1900, possessed two features of\r\nunusual interest--it closed the century and it marked the end of Miss\r\nSusan B. Anthony's presidency of the organization. The latter event\r\nattracted wide attention. Sketches of her career and of the movement\r\nwhose history was almost synonymous with her own, appeared in most of\r\nthe leading newspapers and magazines of the country; special reporters\r\nwere sent to Washington, and the celebration of her eightieth birthday\r\nat the close of the convention was in the nature of a national event.\r\nOn the opening morning the _Post_ said in a leading editorial:\r\n\r\n     Washington entertains the National Woman Suffrage Association\r\n     from year to year with entire complacency, apart from any\r\n     political prejudice, without any sense of partisanship and in a\r\n     spirit of keen interest in the great propaganda which is being\r\n     thus conducted. There was a time, not so very long ago, when the\r\n     plea for suffrage was ridiculed far and wide; but the women have\r\n     worked ahead undaunted by the scoffings of the world, until they\r\n     have actually won the battle in such a marked degree as to give\r\n     them unbounded assurance for the future....\r\n\r\n     The world is beginning to take a new view of this suffrage\r\n     question. The advent of women into the professions and even the\r\n     trades, their appearance as wage-earners in virtually every\r\n     branch of modern activity, and their success in these various\r\n     enterprises which they have entered, have worked a reform even\r\n     more significant than the absolute and universal grant of the\r\n     suffrage would have been. It can not be denied by men to-day that\r\n     the women have become economic factors of marked importance, and\r\n     this appreciation has had a great influence in softening the\r\n     sentiments of the male population toward the suffragists.\r\n\r\n     One of the foremost arguments formerly urged against the\r\n     extension of the suffrage to women was that it would be harmful\r\n     to woman's moral nature to thrust her into contact with the rough\r\n     conditions of campaigning. The women answered that their entrance\r\n     would perhaps redeem the immoral character of the politics of\r\n     many communities. In the minds of impartial observers the\r\n     argument was a stand-off. But this economic, professional\r\n     tendency of the women has done much to destroy the force of the\r\n     men's plea to preserve the women from contaminating contact with\r\n     harsh conditions. The security of the average woman worker in the\r\n     various lines of honest activity which the sex has fearlessly\r\n     entered has worked a revelation. The close of the century is\r\n     witnessing a great change in public sentiment in this regard. The\r\n     demand of the suffragists can not but be strengthened by the\r\n     demonstrated fact that women can become workers in competition\r\n     with men without becoming demoralized.\r\n\r\n     Just where this new tendency will lead in an economic direction\r\n     is a serious question, to be answered by facts rather than by\r\n     theories. Some students of the science believe that it is working\r\n     a revolution and is affecting the whole business fabric. There\r\n     may be a reaction against it, affecting in turn the now moderate\r\n     attitude of most men toward the suffrage question; but in any\r\n     event it is clear that this great agitation, carried on by the\r\n     association now in session, has been of serious importance and\r\n     not without palpable fruits.\r\n\r\nThe advocates of woman's enfranchisement never were brighter, happier\r\nor more hopeful and courageous. All of the States but four were\r\nrepresented by the 173 delegates in attendance. Some of them were\r\nwhite-haired and wrinkled and had been coming to Washington for the\r\nwhole thirty-two years. Others were in the prime and vigor of life and\r\nhad entered the movement after the heaviest blows had been struck and\r\nthe hardest battles had been won, but now they had enlisted until the\r\nend of the war. And now there were a large number of beautiful and\r\nhighly-educated young women, graduates of the best colleges, filled\r\nwith the zeal of new converts, bringing to the work well-trained and\r\nthoroughly-equipped minds and giving to the old members the comforting\r\nassurance that the vital cause would still be carried forward when\r\ntheir own labors were ended.\r\n\r\nThe _Woman's Journal_ in recounting the gains for suffrage concluded:\r\n\"In this year, 1900, the woman suffragists, after a half-century of\r\nunbroken national organization, can go before Congress and claim the\r\nsupport of members from four States who were elected in part by the\r\nvotes of women. They can enforce their pleas before presidential\r\nnominating conventions with the concrete fact that thirteen members of\r\nthe electoral college have a constituency of women voters.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony presided at three public sessions daily and at all the\r\nexecutive and business meetings, went to Baltimore and held a\r\none-day's conference and made a big speech, addressed a parlor\r\nmeeting, attended several dinners and receptions, participated in her\r\nown great birthday festivities, afternoon and evening, and remained\r\nfor nearly a week of Executive Committee meetings after the convention\r\nhad closed.\r\n\r\nAs she rose to open the convention, clad as usual in soft black satin,\r\nwith duchesse lace in the neck and sleeves and the lovely red crépe\r\nshawl falling gracefully from her shoulders, there were many a moist\r\neye and tightened throat at the thought that this was the last time.\r\nHer fine voice with its rich alto vibrations was as strong and\r\nresonant as fifty years ago, and her practical, matter-of-fact speech,\r\nfollowed by the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw's lively stories, soon dispelled\r\nthe sadness and put the audience in a cheerful mood. Miss Anthony\r\ncommenced by saying:\r\n\r\n     I have been attending conventions in Washington for over thirty\r\n     years. It is good for us to come to this Mecca, the heart of our\r\n     nation. Here the members of Congress from all parts of the\r\n     country meet together to deliberate for the best interests of the\r\n     whole government and of their respective States. So our delegates\r\n     assemble here to plan for the best interests of our cause in the\r\n     nation and in their respective States. We come here to study how\r\n     we may do more and more for the spread of the doctrine of\r\n     equality, but chiefly to study how to get the States to\r\n     concentrate their efforts on Congress. Our final aim is an\r\n     amendment to the Federal Constitution providing that no citizen\r\n     over whom the Stars and Stripes wave shall be debarred from\r\n     suffrage except for cause. I am always glad when we come to\r\n     Washington, and in our little peregrinations over the country I\r\n     have been more and more impressed with the conviction that, while\r\n     we should do all the good work we can in our own States, we ought\r\n     to hold our annual meeting in the national capital.\r\n\r\nIn beginning her vice-president's address, which as usual defied\r\nreporting, Miss Shaw said:\r\n\r\n     Before giving my report I want to tell a story against Miss\r\n     Anthony. We suffragists have been called everything under the\r\n     sun, and when there was nothing else quite bad enough for us we\r\n     have been called infidels, which includes everything. Once we\r\n     went to hold a convention in a particularly orthodox city in New\r\n     York, and Miss Anthony, wishing to impress upon the audience that\r\n     we were not atheists, introduced me as \"a regularly-ordained\r\n     orthodox minister, the Rev. Anna H. Shaw, _my right bower_!\" That\r\n     orthodox audience all seemed to know what a \"right bower\" is, for\r\n     they laughed even louder than you do. After the meeting Miss\r\n     Anthony said to me, \"Anna, what did I say to make the people\r\n     laugh so?\" I answered, \"You called me your right bower.\" She\r\n     said, \"Well, you are my right-hand man. That is what right bower\r\n     means, isn't it?\" And this orthodox minister had to explain to\r\n     her Quaker friend what a right bower is.\r\n\r\n     The chief event of last summer was the quinquennial meeting of\r\n     the International Council of Women in London. The Woman's\r\n     National Council of the United States is made up of about twenty\r\n     societies with an aggregate membership of over a million women.\r\n     It was only allowed two delegates besides its president, and it\r\n     is not a suffrage association, yet it honored two women who have\r\n     been known for some years as suffragists, Miss Anthony and\r\n     myself, by making us its delegates to London. They said they did\r\n     this because they wanted women who did not represent anything too\r\n     radical!\r\n\r\n     That Congress was the greatest assemblage of women from all parts\r\n     of the world that ever had taken place, and therefore the biggest\r\n     suffrage convention ever held. Suffrage seemed to take possession\r\n     of the whole meeting, as it does at every great gathering of\r\n     women. From this point of view it was a decided and emphatic\r\n     success. The largest meeting of all was the one held by the\r\n     Suffrage Association and every suffrage heart would have swollen\r\n     so large it could hardly have been kept within the bounds of the\r\n     body if it had heard the applause with which Miss Anthony was\r\n     greeted. She could not speak for ten minutes....\r\n\r\n     In England I entered upon a role I had never filled before, or\r\n     had any ambition for--I \"entered society,\" and for ten days I was\r\n     in it from before breakfast till after midnight; and I prayed the\r\n     prayer of the Pharisee--I thanked the Lord that I was not as\r\n     other women are who have to go into society all the time. I had\r\n     thought that traveling up and down the country with gripsack in\r\n     hand was hard enough; but it is child's play to hand-shaking and\r\n     hob-nobbing with duchesses and countesses. However, the\r\n     experience was good for us, and it was especially good for those\r\n     American women who had thought that they knew more than other\r\n     women till they met them and found that they didn't.\r\n\r\n     I came home, spent three days there, and then took my grip in\r\n     hand and started out again lecturing--mostly for the Redpath\r\n     bureau, and for people who did not want to hear about suffrage;\r\n     so I spoke on \"The Fate of Republics,\" \"The American Home,\" \"The\r\n     New Man,\" etc. Under these titles I gave them stronger doses of\r\n     suffrage than I ever do to you here, and they received it with\r\n     great enthusiasm, because it was not called suffrage. I spoke the\r\n     other day in Cincinnati to about 3,000 people and they were\r\n     delighted, and did not suspect that I was talking suffrage. They\r\n     don't know what woman suffrage is. They think it only means to\r\n     berate the men. In this way I have perhaps done the best suffrage\r\n     work I possibly could.\r\n\r\nLater in the session Miss Anthony made her report as delegate from\r\nthe National Council of Women of the United States to this\r\nInternational Congress in London, in which she said:\r\n\r\n     During the last seventeen years there has been a perfect\r\n     revolution in England. When Mrs. Stanton and I went there for the\r\n     first time, in 1883, just a few families were not afraid of\r\n     us--the Brights, Peter Taylor's household, and some of the old\r\n     abolitionists who knew all about us. When it was proposed to get\r\n     up a testimonial meeting for us, even the officers of the\r\n     suffrage societies did not dare to sign the invitation. They\r\n     thought we Americans were too radical....\r\n\r\n     This time when we reached London we were the recipients of\r\n     testimonials not only from the real, radical suffrage people, but\r\n     also from the conservatives. At that magnificent Queen's Hall\r\n     meeting of the Suffrage Association, with Mrs. Fawcett presiding,\r\n     three or four thousand people packed the hall. It was a\r\n     representative gathering. Australia and New Zealand were there to\r\n     speak for themselves, and they had me to speak for the United\r\n     States. I tried to have them call on Miss Shaw instead, but they\r\n     would not do it....\r\n\r\n     Every young woman who is to-day enjoying the advantages of free\r\n     schools and opportunities to earn a living and the other enlarged\r\n     rights for women, is a child of the woman suffrage movement. This\r\n     larger freedom has broadened and strengthened women wonderfully.\r\n     At the end of the Council, Lady Aberdeen, who had been its\r\n     president for six years, in a published interview summing up the\r\n     work of the women who had been present, said there was no denying\r\n     that the English-speaking women stood head and shoulders above\r\n     all the others in their knowledge of Parliamentary law, and that\r\n     at the very top were those of the United States and Canada--the\r\n     two freest parts of the world. I said: \"If the women of the\r\n     United States, with their free schools and all their enlarged\r\n     liberties, are not superior to women brought up under monarchical\r\n     forms of government, then there is no good in liberty.\" It is\r\n     because of this freedom that Europeans are always struck with the\r\n     greater self-poise, self-control and independence of American\r\n     women. These characteristics will be still more marked when we\r\n     have mingled more with men in their various meetings. It is only\r\n     by the friction of intellect with intellect that these desirable\r\n     qualities can be gained.\r\n\r\n     The public sessions of the Council were all that heart could\r\n     wish. I was present at only a few of them because the business\r\n     meetings came at the same hour, and were held miles away. But\r\n     every day people would say to me, \"Miss Anthony, you yourself\r\n     could not have made a stronger suffrage speech than So-and-So\r\n     made to-day in such-and-such a section\"--industrial,\r\n     professional, etc. In the educational section, one of the best\r\n     speeches was made by Miss Brownell, dean of Sage College, Cornell\r\n     University, on co-education.\r\n\r\n     It was a great occasion. Here were the advocates of this movement\r\n     for absolutely equal rights received and entertained by the\r\n     nobility of England--American women at the head. Among many\r\n     others a reception was given by the Lord Bishop of London at his\r\n     home, Fulham Palace. In talking with Lady Battersea, daughter of\r\n     a Rothschild, I caught myself repeatedly addressing her as \"Mrs.\r\n     Battersea,\" and I said, \"I suppose I shock you very much by\r\n     forgetting your title.\" She answered emphatically: \"Not at all. I\r\n     like an American to be an American. It is much pleasanter than\r\n     when they come cringing and crawling and trying to conform to our\r\n     customs.\" When all sorts of notables were giving us receptions, I\r\n     said to Lady Aberdeen: \"If this great Council of Women of ten\r\n     nations were meeting in Washington, we would be invited to the\r\n     White House. Can't you contrive an interview with the Queen?\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony then described the reception of the Congress by the Queen\r\nat Windsor Castle, the serving of tea in the great Hall of St. George,\r\nand all the incidents of that interesting occasion, and concluded:\r\n\"What I want most to impress upon you is this: If we had represented\r\nnothing but ourselves we should have been nowhere. Wendell Phillips\r\nsaid: 'When I speak as an individual, I represent only myself, but\r\nwhen I speak for the American Anti-Slavery Society, I represent every\r\none in the country who believes in liberty.' It was because Miss Shaw\r\nand I represented you and all which makes for liberty that we were so\r\nwell received; and I want you to feel that all the honors paid to us\r\nwere paid to you.\"\r\n\r\nA paper to be remembered was that of Mrs. Isabel C. Barrows (Mass.) on\r\nWoman's Work in Philanthropy. After tracing the various lines of\r\nphilanthropic effort in which women had been distinguished, she said\r\nin conclusion that no woman who ever had lived had done more in the\r\nline of philanthropy than Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\nMiss Harriet May Mills (N. Y.) gave a fine address on The Winning of\r\nEducational Freedom, saying in part:\r\n\r\n     Abigail Adams said of the conditions in the early part of the\r\n     nineteenth century: \"Female education in the best families went\r\n     no farther than reading, writing and arithmetic and, in some rare\r\n     instances, music and dancing.\" A lady living in the first quarter\r\n     of the century relates that she returned from a school in\r\n     Charleston, where she had been sent to be \"finished off,\" with\r\n     little besides a knowledge of sixty different lace stitches....\r\n\r\n     The majority of women were content, they asked no change; they\r\n     took no part in the movement for higher education except to\r\n     ridicule it. This, like every other battle for freedom which the\r\n     world has seen, was led by the few brave, strong souls who saw\r\n     the truth and dared proclaim it. In 1820 the world looked aghast\r\n     upon \"bluestockings.\" Because a young woman was publicly examined\r\n     in geometry at one of Mrs. Emma Willard's school exhibitions, a\r\n     storm of ridicule broke forth at so scandalous a proceeding. It\r\n     was ten years after Holyoke was founded before Mary Lyon dared to\r\n     have Latin appear in the regular course, because the views of the\r\n     community would not allow it. Boston had a high school for girls\r\n     in 1825, which was maintained but eighteen months, Mayor Quincy\r\n     declaring that \"no funds of any city could stand the expense.\"\r\n     The difficulty was that \"too many girls attended.\" ...\r\n\r\n     In 1877 President Charles W. Eliot of Harvard protested against\r\n     the opening of the Boston Latin School to girls, saying: \"I\r\n     resist the proposition for the sake of the boys, the girls, the\r\n     schools and the general interest of education.\" Nearly twenty\r\n     years later, he said to the Radcliffe graduates: \"It is a quarter\r\n     of a century since the college doors were open to women. From\r\n     that time, where boys and girls have been educated together, it\r\n     has become a historical fact that women have taken a greater\r\n     number of honors, in proportion to their numbers, than men.\" It\r\n     is to be hoped that the next twenty years may work further\r\n     conversion in the mind of this learned president, and lead him to\r\n     see that equality in citizenship is as desirable as equality in\r\n     education.\r\n\r\n     One learned man prophesied that all educated women would become\r\n     somnambulists. Another declared that the perilous track to higher\r\n     education would be strewn with wrecks. There are now over thirty\r\n     thousand of these college-educated wrecks, the majority of them\r\n     engaged in the active work of the world. It was found in 1874,\r\n     when Dr. E. H. Clarke's evil prophecies as to higher education\r\n     were attracting attention, that at Antioch, opened to women in\r\n     1853, thirteen and one-half per cent. of the men graduates had\r\n     died, nine and three-fourths per cent. of the women. This did not\r\n     include war mortality or accidental death. Three of the men then\r\n     living were confirmed invalids; not one of the women was in such\r\n     a condition. The Association of Collegiate Alumnae has compiled\r\n     later and fuller statistics. The results show an increase during\r\n     the college course of from three to six per cent. in good health,\r\n     and the health after graduation to be twenty-two per cent. higher\r\n     among graduates than among women who have not been in college....\r\n\r\n     Elizabeth Blackwell applied to twelve colleges before she gained\r\n     admittance to the Geneva (N. Y.) Medical School in 1846, and\r\n     secured the first M. D. ever given to a woman in this country.\r\n     To-day 1,583 women are studying medicine. Not so full a measure\r\n     of freedom has been won in law or theology. In 1897, 131 women\r\n     were in the law schools, 193 in the theological schools, but\r\n     women are still handicapped in these professions....\r\n\r\n     Unfortunately, educational freedom has not been followed by\r\n     industrial freedom. Of the leading colleges for women but four\r\n     have women presidents; but one offers a free field to women on\r\n     its professional staff. In the majority of co-educational\r\n     colleges which give women any place as teachers, they appear in\r\n     small numbers as assistant professors and, more often, as\r\n     instructors....\r\n\r\n     With educational freedom partially won has come general interest\r\n     among collegiate and non-collegiate women in furthering the\r\n     movement. Large gifts have been bestowed for scholarships and for\r\n     colleges, both co-educational and separate. Within the last year\r\n     thirty-four women have given $4,446,400 to the cause of\r\n     education. Mrs. Stanford's munificent benefactions, and other\r\n     lesser ones, swell the amount to more than fifty millions from\r\n     women alone. As a result of the struggle for educational freedom,\r\n     we have 35,782 women in the colleges of the country.[120]\r\n\r\n     Educational freedom without political freedom is but partial.\r\n     Minerva sprang fully armed from the head of Jove; not only had\r\n     she wisdom, but she had the spear and the helmet in her\r\n     hands--every weapon of offense and defense to equip her for the\r\n     world's conquest. Standing on the threshold of the new century,\r\n     we behold the woman of the future thus armed; we see the fully\r\n     educated woman possessed of a truer knowledge of the fundamental\r\n     principles of government; we see her conscious of her\r\n     responsibilities as a citizen, and doing her part in the making\r\n     of laws and in the fulfilment of the ideal of democracy.\r\n     Educational freedom must lead to political freedom.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary C. C. Bradford, a leader among Colorado women, spoke\r\neloquently on The Social Transformation, following the stages in\r\nevolution expressed in the words, \"I dare, I will, I am.\" Describing\r\nthe effects of woman suffrage, she said:\r\n\r\n     I wish I could make you all understand that the home is not\r\n     touched. Equal suffrage does not mean destruction or\r\n     disintegration but the radiation of the home--carrying it out\r\n     into the wider life of the community. The ideal of the family\r\n     must pervade society; and that is what equal suffrage is\r\n     gradually bringing about. I know you hear all sorts of things\r\n     about woman suffrage in Colorado. Not very long ago certain\r\n     Eastern papers gave great prominence to an interview with a\r\n     \"distinguished citizen of Colorado,\" who gave a highly\r\n     unfavorable account of the workings of woman suffrage there. The\r\n     \"distinguished citizen\" in question was a prize-fighter who had\r\n     killed three men--a gambler driven out by woman suffrage; and he\r\n     naturally said that woman suffrage was a failure.... The great\r\n     Woman's Club of Denver is a power for good in the city; it is\r\n     carrying on schools in \"the bottoms,\" night schools, kitchen\r\n     gardens, traveling libraries; it secured the establishment of the\r\n     State Home for Dependent Children, the removal of the emblems\r\n     from the Australian ballot, and other good things....\r\n\r\n     I would that you could all go out to Colorado and see how\r\n     subtly, yes, and how swiftly, the social transformation is going\r\n     on. It is the home transforming the State, not the State\r\n     destroying the home. A Denver paper lately said the men had found\r\n     out that in determining all questions of morality, sanitation,\r\n     etc., if the women were consulted, better results were obtained.\r\n     We have more intelligent homes because of equal suffrage. Where\r\n     children see their father and mother go to the polls together,\r\n     and hear them talk over public questions, and occasionally\r\n     express different views, they learn tolerance. A party slave will\r\n     not come out from such a home. The children will grow up seeing\r\n     that it is un-American to say that everybody in the opposite\r\n     party is either a fool or a knave. The two best features of equal\r\n     suffrage are the improvement of the individual woman and the\r\n     prospective abolition of the political \"boss.\"\r\n\r\nIntroducing Henry B. Blackwell (Mass.) to report on Presidential\r\nSuffrage, Miss Anthony said: \"Here is a man who has the virtue of\r\nhaving stood by the woman's cause for nearly fifty years. I can\r\nremember him when his hair was not white, and when he was following up\r\nour conventions assiduously because a bright, little, red-cheeked\r\nwoman attracted him. She attracted him so strongly that he still works\r\nfor woman suffrage, and will do so as long as he lives, not only\r\nbecause of her who was always so true and faithful to the cause--Lucy\r\nStone--but also because he has a daughter, a worthy representative of\r\nthe twain who were made one.\"\r\n\r\nOn Friday evening Mrs. Ida Husted Harper gave a portion of her paper,\r\nThe Training of the Woman Journalist, which she had presented at the\r\nInternational Congress in London. Miss Anna Barrows (Mass.), literary\r\neditor of _The American Kitchen Magazine_, spoke on New Professions\r\nfor Women Centering in the Home:\r\n\r\n     The main objection made by conservative people to definite\r\n     occupations or professions for women has been that such callings\r\n     would inevitably tend to destroy the home. Once let women prove\r\n     that they can follow a trade or profession and yet make a home\r\n     for themselves and others, and such objectors have no ground\r\n     left.... The fear is sometimes expressed that the club movement\r\n     is drawing women away from home interests; but the general\r\n     attention now given to household economics by all the women's\r\n     clubs proves that women are realizing that knowledge of history,\r\n     art and science is needed to give the broad culture necessary for\r\n     the proper conduct of the home life. Although as yet few women's\r\n     colleges offer adequate courses in home economics, nevertheless\r\n     after marriage the college women begin to study household\r\n     problems with all the energy brought out by the college\r\n     training.\r\n\r\n     A very general comment on woman's desire for a share in municipal\r\n     and national government is that the servant question is yet\r\n     unsolved; that, since she has not succeeded in governing her own\r\n     domain, she has no rights outside of it. By going outside of her\r\n     home as an employee herself she is learning to deal with this\r\n     problem. It has been necessary for women to have thorough\r\n     business training in other directions before they could discover\r\n     how unbusinesslike were the methods pursued in the average\r\n     household. The more women have gone out of their homes into new\r\n     occupations, the more they have realized that the home is\r\n     dependent upon the same principles as the business world. The\r\n     business woman understands human nature, and therefore can deal\r\n     successfully with the butcher, the baker and other tradespeople.\r\n     She has a power of adapting herself to new conditions which is\r\n     impossible to her sister accustomed only to the narrow treadmill\r\n     of housework.\r\n\r\n     Specialization is the tendency of the age, and by wise attention\r\n     to this in the household, as elsewhere, enough time should be\r\n     saved to each community for the world's work to be done in fewer\r\n     hours, and for men and women to have time besides to be\r\n     homemakers and good citizens. Little by little one art and craft\r\n     after another has been evolved into the dignity of a profession,\r\n     while housework as a whole has been left to untrained workers.\r\n     Needle work, cookery and cleaning are dependent on the\r\n     fundamental principles of all the natural sciences.... There is\r\n     need also of trained women to lead public sentiment to recognize\r\n     the dignity of manual labor.\r\n\r\nThe statesmanlike paper of Mrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker (Conn.) on the\r\nDuty of Woman Citizens of the United States in the Present Political\r\nCrisis, was read by Mrs. Mary Seymour Howell (N. Y.), who enforced its\r\nsentiments by earnest and stirring remarks of her own. Mrs. Mary\r\nChurch Terrell, A. M. of Oberlin College, president of the National\r\nAssociation of Colored Women and a member of the Washington School\r\nBoard, considered the Justice of Woman Suffrage:\r\n\r\n     ....To assign reasons in this day and time why it is unjust to\r\n     deprive one-half of the human race of rights and privileges\r\n     freely accorded to the other, which is neither more deserving nor\r\n     more capable of exercising them, seems like a reflection upon the\r\n     intelligence of the audience. As a nation we professed long ago\r\n     to have abandoned the principle that might makes right. Before\r\n     the world we pose to-day as a government whose citizens have the\r\n     right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness. And yet, in\r\n     spite of these lofty professions and noble sentiments, the\r\n     present policy of this government is to hold one-half of its\r\n     citizens in legal subjection to the other, without being able to\r\n     assign good and sufficient reasons for such a flagrant violation\r\n     of the very principles upon which it was founded.\r\n\r\n     When one observes how all the most honorable and lucrative\r\n     positions in Church and State have been reserved for men,\r\n     according to laws which they themselves have made so as to debar\r\n     women; how, until recently, a married woman's property was under\r\n     the exclusive control of her husband; how, in all transactions\r\n     where husband and wife are considered one, the law makes the\r\n     husband that one--man's boasted chivalry to the disfranchised sex\r\n     is punctured beyond repair.\r\n\r\n     These unjust discriminations will ever remain, until the source\r\n     from which they spring--the political disfranchisement of\r\n     woman--shall be removed. The injustice involved in denying woman\r\n     the suffrage is not confined to the disfranchised sex alone, but\r\n     extends to the nation as well, in that it is deprived of the\r\n     excellent service which woman might render....\r\n\r\n     The argument that it is unnatural for woman to vote is as old as\r\n     the rock-ribbed and ancient hills. Whatever is unusual is called\r\n     unnatural, the world over. Whenever humanity takes a step forward\r\n     in progress, some old custom falls dead at our feet. Nothing\r\n     could be more unnatural than that a good woman should shirk her\r\n     duty to the State.\r\n\r\n     If you marvel that so few women work vigorously for political\r\n     enfranchisement, let me remind you that woman's success in almost\r\n     everything depends upon what men think of her. Why the majority\r\n     of men oppose woman suffrage is clear even to the dullest\r\n     understanding. In all great reforms it is only the few brave\r\n     souls who have the courage of their convictions and who are\r\n     willing to fight until victory is wrested from the very jaws of\r\n     fate.\r\n\r\nIn treating of Women in the Ministry, the Rev. Ida C. Hultin (Mass.)\r\nconsidered what is known as \"the woman movement\" from a broad and\r\nphilosophical standpoint, which carried conviction and disarmed\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nAt the opening of the Saturday evening meeting a telegram was read\r\nfrom the Executive Committee of the National Anti-Trust Conference, in\r\nsession at Chicago: \"Hearty congratulations to the distinguished\r\npresident of the Woman Suffrage Association, and hopes that Miss\r\nAnthony may enjoy many years of added happiness and honor. This\r\ncordial salutation includes Elizabeth Cady Stanton and all of the\r\nnoble souls who have wrought so great a work in the liberation and\r\nadvancement of the women of this country.\" A letter was read also from\r\nFrank Morrison, secretary of the American Federation of Labor, with\r\nthe following resolution, which was passed by the convention held in\r\nDetroit, Mich., the previous December:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Disfranchised labor, like that of the enslaved, degrades\r\n     all free and enfranchised labor; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the American Federation of Labor earnestly\r\n     appeals to Congress to pass a resolution submitting to the\r\n     Legislatures of the several States a proposition for a Sixteenth\r\n     Amendment to the Federal Constitution that shall prohibit the\r\n     States from disfranchising United States citizens on account of\r\n     sex.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony expressed her satisfaction that equal suffrage was\r\nendorsed by \"the hard-working, wage-earning men of the country, each\r\nof them with a good solid ballot in his hand.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Clara Bewick Colby (D. C.) gave a historical sketch of Our Great\r\nLeaders, replete with beauty and pathos. Miss Kate M. Gordon spoke\r\nentertainingly on the possibilities of A Scrap of Suffrage.[121] In\r\npresenting her Miss Anthony said: \"The right of taxpaying women in\r\nLouisiana to vote upon questions of taxation is practically the first\r\nshred of suffrage which those of any Southern State have secured, and\r\nthey have used it well. They deserve another scrap, and I think they\r\nwill get it before some of us do who have been asking for half a\r\ncentury.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Gail Laughlin, a graduate of Wellesley and of the Law Department\r\nof Cornell University, discussed Conditions of the Wage-Earning Women\r\nof Our Country, saying in part:\r\n\r\n     \"Wage-earner\" among women is used in a broad sense. All women\r\n     receiving money payment for work are proud to be called\r\n     wage-earners, because wage-earning means economic independence.\r\n     The census of 1890 reports nearly 400 occupations open to women,\r\n     and nearly 4,000,000 women engaged in them. But government\r\n     reports show the average wages of women in large cities to be\r\n     from $3.83 to $6.91 per week, and the general average to be from\r\n     $5.00 to $6.68. In all lines women are paid less than men for the\r\n     same grade of work, and they are often compelled to toil under\r\n     needlessly dangerous and unsanitary conditions. If the people of\r\n     this country want to advance civilization, they have no need to\r\n     go to the islands of the Pacific to do it.\r\n\r\n     How are these evils to be remedied? By organization, suffrage,\r\n     co-operation among women, and above all, the inculcation of the\r\n     principle that a woman is an individual, with a right to choose\r\n     her work, and with other rights equal with man. Our law-makers\r\n     control the sanitary conditions and pay of teachers. Here is work\r\n     for the women who have \"all the rights they want.\" When one of\r\n     these comfortably situated women was told of the need of the\r\n     ballot for working women, she held up her finger, showing the\r\n     wedding ring on it, and said, \"I have all the rights I want.\" The\r\n     next time that I read the parable of the man who fell among\r\n     thieves and was succored by the good Samaritan, methought I could\r\n     see that woman with the wedding ring on her finger, passing by on\r\n     the other side.\r\n\r\n     It is said that every woman who earns her living crowds a man\r\n     out. That argument is as old as the trade guilds of the\r\n     thirteenth century, which tried to exclude women. The Rev. Samuel\r\n     G. Smith of St. Paul, who has recently declared against women in\r\n     wage-earning occupations, stands to-day just where they did seven\r\n     hundred years ago....[122]\r\n\r\nMrs. Helen Adelaide Shaw (Mass.), in A Review of the Remonstrants, was\r\nenthusiastically received. Young, handsome and a fine elocutionist,\r\nher imitation of the \"remonstrants\" and their objections to woman\r\nsuffrage convulsed the audience and was quite as effective as the most\r\nimpassioned argument.\r\n\r\nThe speakers of the convention were invited to fill a number of\r\npulpits in Washington Sunday morning and evening. In the Unitarian\r\nChurch, where the Rev. Ida C. Hultin preached, there was not standing\r\nroom. The Rev. Anna Howard Shaw gave the sermon at the Universalist\r\nChurch, of which the _Post_ said:\r\n\r\n     Never in the history of the church had such a crowd been in\r\n     attendance. The lecture rooms on either side of the auditorium\r\n     had been thrown open, and these, as well as the galleries, were\r\n     crowded almost to suffocation. Women stood about the edges of the\r\n     room, and seats on window sills were at a premium. Outside in the\r\n     vestibules of the church women elbowed one another for points of\r\n     vantage on the gallery stairs, where an occasional glimpse might\r\n     be caught of the handsome, dark-eyed, gray-haired woman who\r\n     looked singularly appropriate at the pulpit desk. The\r\n     congregation hung upon every word, and her remarks, sometimes\r\n     bitter and caustic, were met with a hum of approval from the\r\n     crowded auditorium.\r\n\r\n     Perhaps eight-tenths of the congregation were women. Miss Shaw's\r\n     pulpit manner is easy, but her words are emphasized by gestures\r\n     which impress her hearers with a sense of the speaker's\r\n     earnestness. Her voice, while sweet and musical, is strong, and\r\n     carries a tone of conviction. Her subject last night was\r\n     \"Strength of Character.\" The text was chosen from Joshua, 1:9:\r\n     \"Have I not commanded thee? Be strong and of good courage; be not\r\n     afraid, neither be thou dismayed; for the Lord thy God is with\r\n     thee whithersoever thou goest.\"\r\n\r\n     In the opening remarks the speaker said it was now time that\r\n     women asserted their rights. \"Men have no right to define for us\r\n     our limitations. Who shall interpret to a woman the divine\r\n     element in her being? It is for me to say that I shall be free.\r\n     No human soul shall determine my life for me unless that soul\r\n     will stand before the bar of God and take my sentence. Men who\r\n     denounce us do so because they are ignorant of what they do.\r\n     Woman has broken the silence of the century. Her question to God\r\n     is, 'Who shall interpret Thee to me?' The churches of this day\r\n     have not begun to conceive of what Christianity means.\r\n\r\n     \"It is not true that all women should be married and the managers\r\n     of homes. There is not more than one woman in five capable of\r\n     motherhood in its highest possible state, and I may say that not\r\n     one man in ten is fitted for fatherhood. We strongly advocate\r\n     that no woman and man should marry until they are instructed in\r\n     the science of home duties. Instead of woman suffrage breaking up\r\n     families, it has just the opposite effect. In the State of\r\n     Wyoming where it has existed thirty years, there is a larger per\r\n     cent. of marriages and a less of divorces than in any other State\r\n     in the Union. Because a woman is a suffragist is no reason that\r\n     she may not be a good housekeeper. The two most perfect\r\n     housekeepers I ever knew in my life were members of my\r\n     congregation in New England--one was a suffragist and the other\r\n     had no thought of the rights of women.\" ...\r\n\r\n     After the services almost every woman in the congregation crowded\r\n     forward to shake the hand of the speaker.\r\n\r\nOn Monday evening the national character of the convention was\r\nconspicuously demonstrated, as the speakers represented the East, the\r\nSouth, the Middle West and the Pacific Slope. Mrs. Florence Howe Hall\r\n(N. J.), the highly educated daughter of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, read a\r\ncharming farce entitled The Judgment of Minerva, the suffragists and\r\nthe antis, as goddesses, bringing their cause before Jupiter, with a\r\ndecision, of course, in favor of the former. Miss Diana Hirschler, a\r\nyoung lawyer of Boston, presented Woman's Position in the Law in a\r\npaper which was in itself an illustration of the benefit of a legal\r\ntraining. Mrs. Virginia D. Young (S. C.) told the Story of Woman\r\nSuffrage in the South, and sketched the history of the progressive\r\nSouthern woman, beginning as follows:\r\n\r\n     The woman suffragists of the South have suffered in the pillory\r\n     of public derision. It has been as deadly a setting up in the\r\n     stocks as ever New England practiced on her martyrs to freedom.\r\n     The women who have led in this revolt against old ideals have had\r\n     to be as heroic as the men who stormed San Juan heights in the\r\n     contest for Santiago de Cuba....\r\n\r\n     It is out of date to be carried in a sedan chair when one can fly\r\n     around on a bicycle, and though in our conservative South, we\r\n     have still some preachers with Florida moss on their chins, who\r\n     storm at the woman on her wheel as riding straight to hell, we\r\n     believe, with Julian Ralph, that the women bicyclists \"out-pace\r\n     their staider sisters in their progress to woman's emancipation.\"\r\n\r\n     Clark Howell, the brilliant Georgian, in his recent address\r\n     before the Independent Club, set people to talking about him,\r\n     from Niagara Falls in the East to the Garden of the Gods in the\r\n     West, by his elucidations of \"The Man with his Hat in his Hand;\"\r\n     but I propose to show you to-night a greater--the Woman With Her\r\n     Bonnet Off, who speaks from the platform in a Southern city. You\r\n     know how the women of the stagnant Orient stick to their veils,\r\n     coverings for head and face, outward signs of real slavery. The\r\n     bonnet is the civilized substitute for the Oriental veil, and to\r\n     take it off is the first manifestation of a woman's resolve to\r\n     have equal rights, even if all the world laugh and oppose.\r\n\r\n     In South Carolina the first newspaper article in favor of woman\r\n     suffrage written by a woman over her own name, was met by the\r\n     taunt that she had imbibed her views from the women of the North.\r\n     But this was merely ignorance of history, for the story of woman\r\n     suffrage in the South really antedates that in New England. The\r\n     new woman of the new South, who asks for equal rights with her\r\n     brother man, is in the direct line of succession to that\r\n     magnificent \"colonial dame,\" Mistress Margaret Brent of Maryland,\r\n     who asked for a vote in the Colonial Assembly after the death of\r\n     her kinsman, Lord Baltimore, who had endowed her with powers of\r\n     attorney. Margaret Brent antedated Abigail Adams by over a\r\n     century.\r\n\r\nMrs. Annie L. Diggs, State librarian, depicted Municipal Suffrage in\r\nKansas, with the knowledge of one who had been a keen observer and an\r\nactive participant.[123] Mrs. Abigail Scott Duniway described the work\r\nwhich had been and would be done in the interest of the approaching\r\nsuffrage amendment campaign in Oregon.\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday evening Mrs. Mabel Loomis Todd (Mass.), under the head of\r\nThe Village Beautiful, told what might be accomplished toward the\r\nbeautifying of towns and cities if the authority and the means were\r\nallowed to women. This was followed by a strong, clear business talk\r\nfrom Mrs. A. Emmagene Paul, superintendent of the Street-Cleaning\r\nDepartment of the First Ward, Chicago, who told how \"crooked\r\ncontractors and wily politicians\" at first began to cultivate her.\r\nThey found, however, that they could not shake her determination to\r\nmake them live up to their contracts; they had agreed to clean the\r\nstreets, they were receiving pay for that purpose, and she, as an\r\ninspector, was there to see that the contracts were lived up to. Mrs.\r\nPaul was appointed when the municipal government adopted a civil\r\nservice system, and holds her position by virtue of its examination.\r\nShe has checkmated the contractor and politician, and has accomplished\r\na long-needed reform in the street-cleaning department of\r\nChicago.[124]\r\n\r\nAn interesting description of The Russian Woman was given by Madame\r\nSofja Levovna Friedland, who said that there is little suffrage for\r\neither men or women in Russia, but such as there is both alike\r\npossess. Mrs. Amy K. Cornwall, president of the Colorado Equal\r\nSuffrage Association, related the work accomplished by the women of\r\nher State since they had been enfranchised; \"only six years,\" she\r\nsaid, \"and yet we are expected to have cleaned up all Colorado,\r\nincluding Denver.\" Grace Greenwood (Mrs. Sara J. Lippincott) was\r\nintroduced by Miss Anthony as a suffragist of thirty years' standing.\r\nThe audience was greatly amused by her recital of the answers which\r\nshe had made to the \"remonstrants\" more than a quarter of a century\r\nago, showing that they were using then exactly the same objections\r\nwhich are doing service to-day. Several of the speakers having failed\r\nto appear, a very unusual occurrence, Mrs. May Wright Sewall,\r\npresident of the International Council of Women, was pressed into\r\nservice by Miss Anthony. She introduced her address gracefully by\r\nsaying: \"We women think we believe in freedom, but we are often told\r\nthat we love best the tyrant who can make us obey, and I can testify\r\nto the truth of it,\" motioning toward Miss Anthony. She then made an\r\neloquent and convincing plea for the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\nThe mornings were devoted to committee reports and to ten-minute\r\nreports from each of the States, often the most interesting features\r\nof the convention. The afternoons were given to Work Conferences, when\r\nall the various details of the work were discussed under the\r\nleadership of those who had proved most competent--methods of\r\norganization, of holding conventions, etc. The treasurer, Mrs. Upton,\r\nstated that the receipts for the past year were $10,345; that the\r\nassociation had an indebtedness of about $1,400, and Miss Anthony,\r\ndesiring to leave it entirely free from debt, had raised almost all of\r\nthis amount herself; that the books now showed every bill to be paid.\r\nBefore the close of the convention almost $10,000 were subscribed\r\ntoward the work of the coming year. It was decided to hold a National\r\nSuffrage Bazar in New York City before the holidays in order to add to\r\nthis fund.[125]\r\n\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt, chairman of the Organization Committee, reported\r\nthat with the secretary of the committee, Miss Mary G. Hay, she had\r\nvisited twenty States, lecturing and attending State conventions,\r\ngiving fifty-one lectures and traveling 13,000 miles. Ten thousand\r\nletters had been sent out from the office.\r\n\r\nThe comprehensive report of Mrs. Elnora M. Babcock (N. Y.), chairman\r\nof the Press Committee, showing the remarkable success achieved in\r\nsecuring the publication of articles on suffrage, seemed to offer the\r\nbest possible proof of an increasing favorable public sentiment.\r\nArticles had been furnished regularly to 1,360 newspapers; 3,675 had\r\nbeen prepared on the present convention and birthday celebration;\r\naltogether 31,800 weekly articles had been sent out and, so far as\r\ncould be ascertained, all had been published. The number of papers\r\nwhich would use plate matter on suffrage was limited only by the money\r\nwhich could be commanded to supply it.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony, in reporting for the Congressional Committee, made a\r\ngood point when she said:\r\n\r\n     One reason why so little has been done by Congress is because\r\n     none of us has remained here to watch our employes up at the\r\n     Capitol. Nobody ever gets anything done by Congress or by a State\r\n     Legislature except by having some one on hand to look out for it.\r\n     We need a Watching Committee. The women can not expect to get as\r\n     much done as the railroads, the trusts, the corporations and all\r\n     the great moneyed concerns. They keep hundreds of agents at the\r\n     national Capital to further their interests. We have no one here,\r\n     and yet we expect to get something done, although we labor under\r\n     the additional disadvantage of having no ballots to use as a\r\n     reward or punishment. Whatever takes place in Washington is felt\r\n     to the circumference of the country. I have had nearly all the\r\n     States send petitions to Congress asking that upon whatever terms\r\n     suffrage is extended to the men of Hawaii and our other new\r\n     possessions, it may be extended to the women, and it is this\r\n     which has stirred up the anti-suffragists in Massachusetts, New\r\n     York and Illinois to their recent demonstrations.... Mrs. Harper\r\n     has culled extracts from all the favorable congressional reports\r\n     we have had during the past thirty years, and we have made a\r\n     pamphlet of them, which will be laid on the desk of every member\r\n     of Congress.[126]\r\n\r\nMary F. Gist, Anna S. Hamilton and Emma Southwick Brinton were\r\nintroduced as fraternal delegates from the Woman's National Press\r\nAssociation; Mrs. William Scott, from the Universal Peace Union; Dr.\r\nAgnes Kemp, from the Peace Society of Philadelphia; Elizabeth B.\r\nPassmore from the Baltimore Yearly Meeting of Friends. Letters of\r\ngreeting were received from Mrs. Priscilla Bright McLaren of Scotland,\r\nMrs. Mary Foote Henderson, of Washington, D. C., and many others.\r\n\r\nAmong the memorial resolutions were the following:\r\n\r\n     In reviewing the gains and losses of the past year, we recall\r\n     with profound regret the loss of those tried and true workers for\r\n     woman's enfranchisement, George W. and Mrs. Henrietta M. Banker\r\n     of New York, who died within a few days of each other. \"Lovely in\r\n     life, in death they were not divided.\" Although we shall sorely\r\n     miss their genial and inspiring presence, they will continue by\r\n     the munificent provisions of their wills to aid the cause.\r\n\r\n     We are also saddened by the news just received of the decease of\r\n     Dr. Elizabeth C. Sargent of San Francisco, our valued co-worker\r\n     in the recent California Suffrage Campaign, and daughter of our\r\n     lifelong friends, U. S. Senator Aaron A. and Mrs. Ellen Clark\r\n     Sargent. All advocates of equal suffrage unite in offering to the\r\n     bereaved mother their heartfelt sympathy in her loss.\r\n\r\nA vote of thanks was passed to Bishop Spaulding of Peoria, Ills.,\r\nBishop McQuaid of Rochester, N. Y. (Catholics), and the Rev. Frank M.\r\nBristol of the M. E. Metropolitan Church, Washington (the one attended\r\nby President McKinley), for their recent sermons referring favorably\r\nto woman suffrage. These were the more noticeable as during this\r\nconvention Cardinal Gibbons of Baltimore devoted his Sunday discourse\r\nto a terrific arraignment of society women and those asking for the\r\nsuffrage, denouncing them alike as destroyers of the home, etc.\r\n\r\nThe National Association requested the appointment by President\r\nMcKinley of Mrs. Bertha Honoré Palmer as National Commissioner from\r\nthe United States to the Paris Exposition, and of Mrs. May Wright\r\nSewall as delegate to represent the organized work of women in the\r\nUnited States. Both of these appointments were afterwards made.\r\n\r\nThe corresponding secretary read invitations for the next annual\r\nconvention from the Citizens' Business League of Milwaukee; the\r\nBusiness Men's League and the Mayor of Cincinnati; the Chamber of\r\nCommerce of Detroit; the Business Men's League of San Antonio; the\r\nCleveland Business Men's Convention League; the Suffrage Society of\r\nBuffalo and the following: \"The Minnesota Woman Suffrage Association\r\ntakes great pride in being able to invite you most cordially to hold\r\nyour annual meeting for 1901 in the city of Minneapolis. We guarantee\r\n$600 towards expenses and more if necessary. Enclosed are invitations\r\nfrom the Board of Trade, the Mayor and our three daily newspapers, all\r\nassuring us of financial backing.\" This was signed by Mrs. Martha J.\r\nThompson, president, and Dr. Ethel E. Hurd, corresponding secretary.\r\nThe invitation was accepted.\r\n\r\nThe usual hearings were held Tuesday morning, February 13, in the\r\nMarble Room of the Senate and the committee room of the House\r\nJudiciary, both of which were crowded to the doors, the seats being\r\nfilled with women while members of Congress stood about the sides of\r\nthe room. That before the Senate Committee--John W. Daniel (Va.),\r\nchairman; James H. Berry (Tenn.); George P. Wetmore (R. I.); Addison\r\nG. Foster (Wash.)--was confined to a historical résumé of the movement\r\nfor woman suffrage, the speakers being presented by Miss Anthony. The\r\nWork with Congress was carefully delineated by Mrs. Colby, who\r\nconcluded: \"Everything that a disfranchised class could do has been\r\ndone by women, and never in the long ages in which the love of freedom\r\nhas been evolving in the human heart has there been such an effort by\r\nany other class of people. Surely it ought to win the respect and\r\nsupport of every man in this republic who has a brain to understand\r\nthe blessings of liberty and a heart to beat in sympathy with a\r\nstruggle to obtain it.\"[127]\r\n\r\nMunicipal Suffrage in Kansas was described by Mrs. Laura M. Johns.\r\nWoman Suffrage in Colorado was presented by Mrs. Bradford. Mrs.\r\nHarriot Stanton Blatch told of Woman Suffrage in England, closing as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     We have heard about the suffrage in the Western States of\r\n     America, and the reply always is: \"Oh, that is all very well for\r\n     thinly populated countries.\" Now I am going to tell you a little\r\n     of the suffrage question in England, not a thinly populated\r\n     country, with its 20,000,000 of people crowded in that small\r\n     space.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen of the committee, I would like to draw your attention\r\n     to one thing, which is true in America as well as in\r\n     England--that nothing has been given to women gratuitously. They\r\n     have had at each step to prove their ability before you gave them\r\n     anything else. In 1870 England passed the Education Act, which\r\n     gave women the right to sit on the school boards and to vote for\r\n     them. It was the first time they had had elective school boards\r\n     in England; before that all the education had been controlled by\r\n     church organizations, who had appointed boards of managers. Women\r\n     had been appointed to those boards and so admirable had been\r\n     their work that when the law was passed in 1870 many women stood\r\n     for election and were elected, and in three cases they came in at\r\n     the head of the polls. Five years after that a verdict was passed\r\n     upon the work of those women as school officials, for in 1875,\r\n     women were allowed to go on the poor-law boards. In 1894 the law\r\n     was further modified so that it contemplated the possibility of a\r\n     larger circle of poor-law guardians. Before that there had been a\r\n     high qualification--occupation of a house of a certain rental,\r\n     etc., but now that was all pushed aside. What was the result?\r\n     Nearly 1,000 women are now sitting on the poor-law boards of\r\n     England; 94 on the great board of London itself.\r\n\r\n     These local boards deal with the great asylums, with the great\r\n     pauper schools, with the immense poorhouses and, more than that,\r\n     they deal with one of the largest funds in England, the outdoor\r\n     and indoor relief. What has been the verdict upon the work of\r\n     those women on the poor-law board? In 1896 there was the\r\n     question, when this law was extended to Ireland, whether women\r\n     should be put on those boards. The vote in Parliament was 272 in\r\n     favor of the women and only 8 against. Eight men only, so unwise,\r\n     so foolish, left in the great English Parliament, who said it was\r\n     not for women to deal with those immense bodies of pauper\r\n     children, not for women to deal with this outdoor relief fund,\r\n     not for women to deal with the unfortunate mothers of\r\n     illegitimate children....\r\n\r\n     Women in England, qualified women, have every local vote,\r\n     everything which would correspond with your State and municipal\r\n     vote here, they have all except the Parliamentary vote.\r\n\r\n     In England we have opponents, just as you have here. I do not\r\n     know whether they are more illogical or less so, but they\r\n     certainly do one extraordinary thing--they are in favor of\r\n     everything that has been won and take advantage of it. A large\r\n     number of the 2,000 women who are sitting on the various local\r\n     bodies in England are opposed to the Parliamentary vote for their\r\n     sex, and yet they are really in political life. Now, gentlemen,\r\n     if you want to have the women stop coming here, give us the vote\r\n     and then we won't come; give the \"antis\" the vote, and then they\r\n     will have the political life that they are really longing for.\r\n\r\n     Almost always, if you analyze the anti-suffrage idea in either a\r\n     man or a woman you find it is anti-democratic. I have begun to\r\n     think that I am the only good democrat left in America. I believe\r\n     in the very widest possible suffrage. Why do I believe it?\r\n     Because I have lived and seen the other thing in England, and I\r\n     have seen that as democracy broadened politics was purified. That\r\n     has been the history from the beginning. No politics in the world\r\n     was more corrupt than the English at the beginning of this\r\n     century, but as democracy has come farther and farther into the\r\n     field, England has become politically one of the purest nations\r\n     in the world.\r\n\r\nThe paper on Woman Suffrage in the British Isles and Colonies was\r\nprepared by Miss Helen Blackburn, editor of the _Englishwoman's\r\nReview_; and Woman Suffrage in Foreign Countries was described by Mrs.\r\nJessie Cassidy Saunders. The last address was given by Mrs. Carrie\r\nChapman Catt (N. Y.), Why We Ask for the Submission of an Amendment:\r\n\r\n     A survey of the changes which have been wrought within the past\r\n     hundred years in the status of women--educational, social,\r\n     financial and political--fills the observing man or woman with a\r\n     feeling akin to awe. No great war has been fought in behalf of\r\n     their emancipation; no great political party has espoused their\r\n     cause; no heroes have bled and died for their liberty; yet words\r\n     fail utterly to measure the distance between the \"sphere\" of the\r\n     woman of 1800 and that of the woman of 1900. How has the\r\n     transformation come? What mysterious power has brought it?\r\n\r\n     On the whole, men and women of the present rejoice at every right\r\n     gained and every privilege conceded. Not one jot or tittle would\r\n     they abate the advantage won; yet when the plea is made that the\r\n     free, self-respecting, self-reliant, independent, thinking women\r\n     of this generation be given the suffrage, the answer almost\r\n     invariably comes back, \"When women as a whole demand it, men will\r\n     consider it.\" This answer carries with it the apparent\r\n     supposition that all the changes have come because the majority\r\n     of women wanted them, and that further enlargement of liberty\r\n     must cease because the majority do not want it. Alas, it is a\r\n     sad comment upon the conservatism of the average human being that\r\n     not one change of consequence has been desired by women as a\r\n     whole, or even by a considerable part. It would be nearer the\r\n     truth to say women as a whole have opposed every advance.\r\n\r\n     The progress has come because women of a larger mold, loftier\r\n     ambitions and nobler self-respect than the average have been\r\n     willing to face the opposition of the world for the sake of\r\n     liberty. More than one such as these deserve the rank of martyr.\r\n     The sacrifice of suffering, of doubt, of obloquy, which has been\r\n     endured by the pioneers in the woman movement will never be fully\r\n     known or understood....\r\n\r\n     With the bold demand for perfect equality of rights in every walk\r\n     of life the public have compromised. Not willing to grant all,\r\n     they have conceded something; and by repeated compromises and\r\n     concessions to the main demand the progress of woman's rights has\r\n     been accomplished.\r\n\r\n     There are two kinds of restrictions upon human liberty--the\r\n     restraint of law and that of custom. No written law has ever been\r\n     more binding than unwritten custom supported by popular opinion.\r\n     At the beginning of our century both law and custom restricted\r\n     the liberty of women.\r\n\r\n     It was the edict of custom which prohibited women from receiving\r\n     an education, engaging in occupations, speaking in public,\r\n     organizing societies, or in other ways conducting themselves like\r\n     free, rational human beings. It was law which forbade married\r\n     women to control their own property or to collect their own\r\n     wages, and which forbade all women to vote. The changes have not\r\n     come because women wished for them or men welcomed them. A\r\n     liberal board of trustees, a faculty willing to grant a trial, an\r\n     employer willing to experiment, a broad-minded church willing to\r\n     hear a woman preach, a few liberal souls in a community willing\r\n     to hear a woman speak--these have been the influences which have\r\n     brought the changes.\r\n\r\n     There is no more elaborate argument or determined opposition to\r\n     woman suffrage than there has been to each step of progress....\r\n     Had a vote been taken, co-education itself would have been\r\n     overwhelmingly defeated. In 1840, before women had studied or\r\n     practiced medicine, had it been necessary to obtain permission to\r\n     do so by a vote of men or women, 8,000 graduated women physicians\r\n     would not now be engaged in the healing art in our country. In\r\n     1850, when vindictive epithets were hurled from press, pulpit and\r\n     public in united condemnation of the few women who were\r\n     attempting to be heard on the platform as speakers, had it been\r\n     necessary to secure the right of free public speech through\r\n     Legislatures or popular approval, the voices of women would still\r\n     be silent.... The rights of women have come in direct opposition\r\n     to the popular consensus of opinion. Yet when they have once\r\n     become established, they have been wanted by women and welcomed\r\n     by men.\r\n\r\n     There are a few fanatics who, if they could, would force the\r\n     women of this generation back into the spheres of their\r\n     grandmothers. There are some pessimists who imagine they see all\r\n     natural order coming to a speedy end because of the enlarged\r\n     liberties and opportunities of women. There are sentimentalists\r\n     who believe that the American home, that most sacred unit of\r\n     society, is seriously imperiled by the tendencies of women to\r\n     adopt new duties and interests. But this is not the thought of\r\n     the average American. There are few intelligent men who would be\r\n     willing to provide their daughters no more education than was\r\n     deemed proper for their grandmothers, or who would care to\r\n     restrict them to the old-time limited sphere of action. Thinking\r\n     men and women realize that the American home was never more\r\n     firmly established than at the present time, and that it has\r\n     grown nobler and happier as women have grown more self-reliant.\r\n     The average man and woman recognize that the changes which have\r\n     come have been in the interest of better womanhood and better\r\n     manhood, bringing greater happiness to women and greater\r\n     blessings to men. They recognize that each step gained has\r\n     rendered women fitter companions for men, wiser mothers and far\r\n     abler units of society.\r\n\r\n     The public acknowledges the wisdom, the common sense, the\r\n     practical judgment of the woman movement until it asks for the\r\n     suffrage. In other words, it approves every right gained because\r\n     it is here, and condemns the one right not yet gained because it\r\n     is not here.\r\n\r\n     Had it been either custom or statutory law which forbade women to\r\n     vote, the suffrage would have been won by the same processes\r\n     which have gained every other privilege. A few women would have\r\n     voted, a few men and women would have upheld them, and, little by\r\n     little, year after year, the number of women electors would have\r\n     increased until it became as general for women to vote as it is\r\n     for men. Had this been possible the women would be voting to-day\r\n     in every State in the Union; and undoubtedly their appearance at\r\n     the polls would now be as generally accepted as a matter of fact\r\n     as the college education. But, alas, when this step of\r\n     advancement was proposed, women found themselves face to face\r\n     with the stone wall of Constitutional Law, and they could not\r\n     vote until a majority of men should first give their consent.\r\n     Indeed the experiment was made to gain this sacred privilege by\r\n     easier means. The history of the voting of Susan B. Anthony and\r\n     others is familiar to all, but the Supreme Court decided that the\r\n     National Constitution must first be amended. It therefore becomes\r\n     a necessity to convert to this reform a majority of the men of\r\n     the whole United States.\r\n\r\n     When we recall the vast amount of illiteracy, ignorance,\r\n     selfishness and degradation which exists among certain classes of\r\n     our people the task imposed upon us is appalling. There are whole\r\n     precincts of voters in this country whose united intelligence\r\n     does not equal that of one representative American woman. Yet to\r\n     such classes as these we are asked to take our cause as the court\r\n     of final resort. We are compelled to petition men who have never\r\n     heard of the Declaration of Independence, and who have never\r\n     read the Constitution, for the sacred right of self-government;\r\n     we are forced to appeal for justice to men who do not know the\r\n     meaning of the word; we are driven to argue our claim with men\r\n     who never had two thoughts in logical sequence. We ask men to\r\n     consider the rights of a citizen in a republic and we get the\r\n     answer in reply, given in all seriousness, \"Women have more\r\n     rights now than they ought to have;\" and that, too, without the\r\n     faintest notion of the inanity of the remark or the emptiness of\r\n     the brain behind it.\r\n\r\n     When we present our cause to men of higher standing and more\r\n     liberal opinion, we find that the interest of party and the\r\n     personal ambition for place are obstacles which prevent them from\r\n     approving a question concerning whose popularity there is the\r\n     slightest doubt.\r\n\r\n     The way before us is difficult at best, not because our demand is\r\n     not based upon unquestioned justice, not because it is not\r\n     destined to win in the end, but because of the nature of the\r\n     processes through which it must be won. In fact the position of\r\n     this question might well be used to demonstrate that observation\r\n     of Aristotle that \"a democracy has many striking points of\r\n     resemblance with tyranny....\"\r\n\r\n     It is for these reasons, gentlemen, that we appeal to your\r\n     committee to aid in the submission of a Sixteenth Amendment. Such\r\n     an amendment would go before the Legislatures of our country\r\n     where the grade of intelligence is at least higher than we should\r\n     find in the popular vote.\r\n\r\n     Though you yourselves may doubt the expediency of woman suffrage,\r\n     though you may question the soundness of our claim, yet, in the\r\n     name of democracy, which permits the people to make and amend\r\n     their constitutions, and in the name of American womanhood,\r\n     prepared by a century of unmeasured advance for political duties,\r\n     we beg your aid in the speedy submission of this question. We ask\r\n     this boon in the direct interest of the thousands of women who do\r\n     want to vote, who suffer pangs of humiliation and degradation\r\n     because of their political servitude. We ask it equally in the\r\n     indirect interest of the thousands of women who do not want to\r\n     vote, as we believe their indifference or opposition is the same\r\n     natural conservatism which led other women to oppose the college\r\n     education, the control of property, the freedom of public speech\r\n     and the right of organization.\r\n\r\n     Years ago George William Curtis pleaded for fair play for women.\r\n     It is the same plea we are repeating. We only petition for fair\r\n     play, and this means the submission of our question to the most\r\n     intelligent constituency which has power to act upon it. If we\r\n     shall fail, we will abide by the decision. That is, we will wait\r\n     till courage has grown stronger, reason more logical, justice\r\n     purer, in the positive knowledge that our cause will eventually\r\n     triumph. As the daughters of Zelophehad appealed to Moses and his\r\n     great court for justice, so do the daughters of America appeal to\r\n     you.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony closed the hearing in a speech whose vigor, logic and\r\neloquence were accentuated in the minds of the hearers by the thought\r\nthat for more than thirty years she had made these pleas before\r\ncongressional committees, only to be received with stolid indifference\r\nor open hostility. She began by saying: \"In closing I would like to\r\ngive a little object lesson of the two methods of gaining the\r\nsuffrage. By one it is insisted that we shall carry our question to\r\nwhat is termed a popular vote of each State--that is, that its\r\nLegislature shall submit to the electors the proposition to strike the\r\nlittle adjective \"male\" from the suffrage clause. We have already made\r\nthat experiment in fifteen different elections in ten different\r\nStates. Five States have voted on it twice.\" She then summarized\r\nbriefly the causes of the defeats in the various States, and\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n     Now here is all we ask of you, gentlemen, to save us women from\r\n     any more tramps over the States, such as we have made now fifteen\r\n     times. In nine of those campaigns I myself, made a canvass from\r\n     county to county. In my own State of New York at the time of the\r\n     constitutional convention in 1894, I visited every county of the\r\n     sixty--I was not then 80 years of age, but 74....\r\n\r\n     There is an enemy of the homes of this nation and that enemy is\r\n     drunkenness. Every one connected with the gambling house, the\r\n     brothel and the saloon works and votes solidly against the\r\n     enfranchisement of women, and, I say, if you believe in chastity,\r\n     if you believe in honesty and integrity, then do what the enemy\r\n     wants you not to do, which is to take the necessary steps to put\r\n     the ballot in the hands of women....\r\n\r\n     I pray you to think of this question as you would if the one-half\r\n     of the people who are disfranchised were men, if we women had\r\n     absolute power to control every condition in this country and you\r\n     were obliged to obey the laws and submit to whatever arrangements\r\n     we made. I want you to report on this question exactly as if the\r\n     masculine half of the people were the ones who were deprived of\r\n     this right to a vote in governmental affairs. You would not be\r\n     long in bringing in a favorable report if you were the ones who\r\n     were disfranchised and denied a voice in your Government. If it\r\n     were not women--if it were the farmers of this country, the\r\n     manufacturers, or any class of men who were robbed of their\r\n     inalienable rights, then we would see that class rising in\r\n     rebellion, and the Government shaken to its very foundation; but\r\n     being women, being only the mothers, daughters, wives and sisters\r\n     of men who constitute the aristocracy, we have to submit.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Anna Howard Shaw (Penn.) presided over the hearing before the\r\nHouse Judiciary Committee.[128] The Constitutional Argument was made\r\nby Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake (N. Y.), who said in the course of a\r\nlong and logical address:\r\n\r\n     We find that it is declared in Article IV, Section 4, that \"the\r\n     United States shall guarantee to every State in the Union a\r\n     republican form of Government.\" What is a republican form of\r\n     Government? In a monarchy, the theory is that all power flows\r\n     directly from the monarch; even in constitutional monarchies each\r\n     concession has been obtained \"by consent of our gracious\r\n     sovereign.\" When the laws are based on the idea that the caprices\r\n     of the ruler regulate the privileges granted to the people, it is\r\n     at least logical, even if it is cruel, to refuse the right of\r\n     suffrage to any class of the community. You will agree that this\r\n     is not a monarchy, where power flows from the sovereign to the\r\n     people, but a republic, where the sovereign people give to the\r\n     Executive they have chosen the power to carry out their will. Can\r\n     you really claim that we live under a republican form of\r\n     government when one-half the adult inhabitants are denied all\r\n     voice in the affairs of the nation? It may be better described as\r\n     an oligarchy, where certain privileged men choose the rulers who\r\n     make laws for their own benefit, too often to the detriment of\r\n     the unrepresented portion of our people, who are denied\r\n     recognition as completely as was ever an oppressed class in the\r\n     most odious form of oligarchy which usurped a government.\r\n\r\n     Article XIV, Section 2, provides that \"Representation shall be\r\n     apportioned among the several States according to their\r\n     respective numbers, counting the whole number of persons in each\r\n     State, excluding Indians, not taxed.\" What sort of justice is\r\n     there in excluding from the basis of representation Indians who\r\n     are not taxed and including in this basis women who are taxed?\r\n     The framers of this amendment were evidently impressed with the\r\n     tenet that taxation and representation should be associated, and\r\n     that as the Indian paid no taxes, and was not, therefore, forced\r\n     to carry the burdens of citizenship, he might, with justice, be\r\n     denied the privileges of citizenship. But by what specious\r\n     reasoning can any one maintain that it is honest to tax the great\r\n     body of women citizens, to count them in the basis of\r\n     representation, and yet deny to them the right of personal\r\n     representation at the ballot box? What excuse can be made for\r\n     this monstrous perversion of liberty? Each one of you, gentlemen,\r\n     sits here as the representative of thousands of women who, by\r\n     their money, have helped to build this Capitol in which you\r\n     assemble and to pay for the seats in which you sit; nay, more,\r\n     they pay a part of the salary of every man here, and yet what\r\n     real representation have they? How often do you think of the\r\n     women of your States and of their interests in the laws you pass?\r\n     How much do you reflect on the injustice which is daily and\r\n     hourly done them by denying to them all voice in this body,\r\n     wherein you claim to \"represent the people\" of your respective\r\n     States....\r\n\r\n     Some years ago, when the bill regulating affairs in Utah was\r\n     under discussion Senator Edmunds said, \"Disfranchisement is a\r\n     cruel and degrading penalty, that ought not to be inflicted\r\n     except for crime.\" Yet this cruel and degrading penalty is\r\n     inflicted upon practically all the women of the United States. Of\r\n     what crime have we been guilty? Or is our mere sex a fault for\r\n     which we must be punished? Would not any body of men look upon\r\n     disfranchisement as \"a cruel and degrading penalty?\" Suppose the\r\n     news were to be flashed across our country to-morrow that the\r\n     farmers of the nation were to be disfranchised, what indignation\r\n     there would be! How they would leave their homes to assemble and\r\n     protest against this wrong! They would declare that\r\n     disfranchisement was a burden too heavy to be borne; that if they\r\n     were unrepresented laws would be passed inimical to their best\r\n     interests; that only personal representation at the ballot box\r\n     could give them proper protection; and they would hasten here,\r\n     even as we are doing, to entreat you to remove from them the\r\n     burden of \"the cruel and degrading penalty of disfranchisement.\"\r\n\r\n     And now, I desire to call your attention to a series of\r\n     declarations in the Constitution which prove beyond all\r\n     possibility of contravention that the Government has solemnly\r\n     pledged itself to secure to the women of the nation the right of\r\n     suffrage.\r\n\r\n     Article XIV, Section 1, declares that \"All persons born or\r\n     naturalized in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction\r\n     thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State\r\n     wherein they reside.\" The women of this country are, then,\r\n     citizens thereof and entitled to all the rights of citizens.\r\n\r\n     Article XV speaks of \"the right of a citizen to vote,\" as if that\r\n     were one of the most precious privileges of citizenship, so\r\n     precious that its protection is embodied in a separate amendment.\r\n\r\n     If we now turn to Article IV, Section 2, we find it declares that\r\n     \"the citizens of each State shall be entitled to all the\r\n     privileges and immunities of citizens in the several States.\"\r\n\r\n     What do these assertions mean? Is there one of you who can\r\n     explain away these noble guarantees of the right of individual\r\n     representation at the ballot box as mere one-sided phrases,\r\n     having no significance for one-half the people? No. These grand\r\n     pledges are abiding guarantees of human freedom, honest promises\r\n     of protection to all the people of the republic.\r\n\r\n     You, gentlemen, have sworn to carry out all the provisions of the\r\n     Constitution. Does not this oath lay upon you the duty of seeing\r\n     that this great pledge is kept and that the Fifty-sixth Congress\r\n     sets its mark in history by fulfilling these guarantees and\r\n     securing the ballot to the millions of women citizens, possessing\r\n     every qualification for the intelligent use of this mighty weapon\r\n     of liberty?\r\n\r\n     The Dome of this Capitol is surmounted by a magnificent statue\r\n     representing the genius of American freedom. How is this mighty\r\n     power embodied? As a majestic woman, full-armed and panoplied to\r\n     protect the liberty of the republic. Is not this symbol a mockery\r\n     while the women of the country are held in political slavery? We\r\n     ask you to insist that the pledges of the republic shall be\r\n     redeemed, that its promises shall be fulfilled, and that American\r\n     womanhood shall be enfranchised.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton (N. Y.), as had been her custom during all\r\nthe years since she had ceased to appear in person before these\r\ncommittees, sent a strong appeal for justice, beginning as follows:\r\n\r\n     In adjusting the rights of citizens in our newly-acquired\r\n     possessions, the whole question of suffrage is again fairly open\r\n     for discussion in the House of Representatives; and as some of\r\n     the States are depriving the colored men of the exercise of this\r\n     right and all of the States, except four, deny it to all women, I\r\n     ask Congress to submit an amendment to the National Constitution\r\n     declaring that citizens not allowed a voice in the Government\r\n     shall not be taxed or counted in the basis of representation.\r\n\r\n     To every fair mind, such an amendment would appear pre-eminently\r\n     just, since to count disfranchised classes in the basis of\r\n     representation compels citizens to aid in swelling the number of\r\n     Congressmen who may legislate against their most sacred\r\n     interests. If the Southern States that deny suffrage to negro men\r\n     should find that it limited their power in Congress by counting\r\n     in the basis of representation only those citizens who vote, they\r\n     would see that the interests of the races lay in the same\r\n     direction. A constitutional amendment to this effect would also\r\n     rouse the Northern States to their danger, for the same rule\r\n     applied there in excluding all women from the basis of\r\n     representation would reduce the number of their members of\r\n     Congress one-half. And if the South should continue her suicidal\r\n     policy toward women as well as colored men, her States would be\r\n     at a still greater disadvantage....\r\n\r\n     By every principle of our republic, logically considered, woman's\r\n     emancipation is a foregone conclusion. The great \"declarations,\"\r\n     by the fathers, regarding individual rights and the true\r\n     foundations of government, should not be glittering generalities\r\n     for demagogues to quote and ridicule, but eternal laws of\r\n     justice, as fixed in the world of morals as are the laws of\r\n     attraction and gravitation in the material universe.\r\n\r\n     In regard to the injustice of taxing unrepresented classes, Lord\r\n     Coke says: \"The supreme power can not take from any man his\r\n     property without his consent in person or by representation. The\r\n     very act of taxing those who are not represented appears to me to\r\n     deprive them of one of their most sacred rights as free men, and\r\n     if continued, seems to be in effect an entire disfranchisement of\r\n     every civil right; for what one civil right is worth a rush when\r\n     a man's property is subject to be taken from him without his\r\n     consent?\r\n\r\n     Woman's right to life, liberty and happiness, to education,\r\n     property and representation, can not be denied, for if we go\r\n     back to first principles, where did the few get the right,\r\n     through all time, to rule the many? They never had it, any more\r\n     than pirates had the right to scour the high seas, and take\r\n     whatever they could lay hands upon.\r\n\r\nMiss Elizabeth Sheldon Tillinghast (Conn.) considered The Economic\r\nBasis of Woman Suffrage:\r\n\r\n     ....However we may explain it, and whether we like it or not,\r\n     woman has become an economic factor in our country and one that\r\n     is constantly assuming larger proportions. The question is now\r\n     what treatment will make her an element of economic strength\r\n     instead of weakness as at present. The presence of women in\r\n     business now demoralizes the rate of wages even more than the\r\n     increase in the supply of labor. Why? Principally because she can\r\n     be bullied with greater impunity than voters--because she has no\r\n     adequate means of self-defense. This seems a hard accusation, but\r\n     I believe it to be true.\r\n\r\n     Trade is a fight--an antagonism of interests which are\r\n     compromised in contracts in which the economically stronger\r\n     always wins the advantage. There are many things that contribute\r\n     to economic strength besides ability, and among them the most\r\n     potent is coming more and more to be the power which arises from\r\n     organization expressing itself in political action. Without\r\n     political expression woman's economic value is at the bottom of\r\n     the scale. She is the last to be considered, and the\r\n     consideration is usually about exhausted before she is reached.\r\n\r\n     She must do better work than men for equal pay or equal work for\r\n     less pay. In spite of this she may be supplanted at any time by a\r\n     political adherent, or her place may be used as a bribe to an\r\n     opposing faction. Women are weak in the business world because\r\n     they are new in it; because they are only just beginning to learn\r\n     their economic value; because their inherent tendencies are\r\n     passive instead of aggressive, which makes them as a class less\r\n     efficient fighters than men.\r\n\r\n     For these reasons women are and must be for years, if not for\r\n     generations, economically weaker than men. Does it appeal to any\r\n     one's sense of fairness to give the stronger party in a struggle\r\n     additional advantages and deny them to the weaker one? Would that\r\n     be considered honorable--would it be considered tolerable--even\r\n     among prize-fighters? What would be thought of a contest between\r\n     a heavy-weight and a feather-weight in which the heavy-weight was\r\n     allowed to hit below the belt and the feather-weight was confined\r\n     to the Marquis of Queensberry's rules? And yet these are\r\n     practically the conditions under which women do business in\r\n     forty-one of our States.\r\n\r\n     While the State does not owe any able-bodied, sound-minded man or\r\n     woman a living, it does owe them all a fair--yes, even a generous\r\n     opportunity to earn their own living, and one that shall not be\r\n     prolonged dying. I do not claim that woman suffrage would be a\r\n     panacea for all our economic woes. But I do claim that it would\r\n     remove one handicap which women workers have to bear in addition\r\n     to all those they share in common with men. I do claim that the\r\n     men of the future will be healthier, wiser and more efficient\r\n     wealth-producers if their mothers are stimulated by a practical\r\n     interest in public affairs. I do claim that that nation will be\r\n     the strongest in which the economic conditions are the most\r\n     nearly just to all, and in which co-operation and altruism are\r\n     the most completely incorporated in the lives of the people.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hala Hammond Butt (Miss.) discussed The Changed Intellectual\r\nQualifications of the Women of this Century, with the intense\r\neloquence of Southern women, and closed as follows:\r\n\r\n     There are mighty forces striving within our souls--a latent\r\n     strength is astir that is lifting us out of our passive sleep.\r\n     Defenseless, still are we subject to restrictions, bonds as\r\n     illogical in theory as unjust in practice. Helpless, we may\r\n     formulate as we will; but demonstrate we may not. The query\r\n     persists in thrusting itself upon my mind, why should I be\r\n     amenable to a law that does not accord me recognition? Why,\r\n     indeed, should I owe loyalty and allegiance to a Government that\r\n     stamps my brow with the badge of servility and inferiority?\r\n\r\n     Our human interests are identical--yours and mine; our paths not\r\n     far apart; we have the same loves, the same hates, the same\r\n     hopes, the same desires; a common origin, a common need, a common\r\n     destiny. Our moral responsibilities are equal, our civil\r\n     liabilities not less than yours, our social and industrial\r\n     exactions equally as stringent as yours, and yet--O, crowning\r\n     shame of the nineteenth century!--we are denied the garb of\r\n     citizenship. Gentlemen, is this justice?\r\n\r\nMrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch, auditor of the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation and a member of the Chicago bar, demonstrated The\r\nProtective Power of the Ballot:\r\n\r\n     The spirit of struggle against oppression and dependence is in\r\n     the air, and all have breathed it in--women as well as men. They,\r\n     too, feel the desire for freedom, opportunity, progress; the wish\r\n     for liberty, a share in the government, emancipation. The\r\n     practical method by which these aspirations can be realized is\r\n     through the ballot. It is the insignia of power. The Outlander\r\n     wants it; so does the Filipino, the Slav, the Cuban; so do women.\r\n     Women need the ballot not only for the honor of being esteemed\r\n     peers among freemen, but they want it for the practical value it\r\n     will be in protecting them in the exercise of a citizen's\r\n     prerogatives....\r\n\r\n     But, it is asked, \"Have not women had some sort of protection\r\n     without the ballot?\" Yes, but it has been only such protection\r\n     as the caprice or affection of the voting class has given,\r\n     gratuities revocable at will. The man of wealth or power defends\r\n     his wife, daughter or sweetheart because she is his, just as he\r\n     would defend his property. His own opinions, not her views,\r\n     decide him concerning the things from which she should be\r\n     protected. Should she ever need protection against \"her\r\n     protector,\" there is no one to give it....\r\n\r\n     Entrance into remunerative employments in many instances has been\r\n     denied women. In many of the States the professions of law,\r\n     medicine, dentistry and all the elective offices are closed by\r\n     statute. Appointive positions, also, which women might legally\r\n     hold are practically withheld from them because of their lack of\r\n     the ballot. The appointing power--president, governor, mayor,\r\n     judge or commissioner--all owe their own positions to voters who\r\n     expect some minor appointment in acknowledgment of service.\r\n\r\n     Even large private corporations not supposed to be influenced by\r\n     politics have occasionally desired and received governmental help\r\n     and protection. In return, the employes of these enterprises have\r\n     been advised to vote for the party which has protected their\r\n     employers' business. At a caucus, a street parade and on election\r\n     day, the 500 or 10,000 or 100,000 persons employed in a certain\r\n     industry make a considerable political showing if they are all\r\n     voters. On such occasions women employes are of no value. Women\r\n     refused employment in various enterprises not alone are injured\r\n     in their feelings, but they are not protected in their right to\r\n     earn food, shelter and clothes.\r\n\r\n     There are many different kinds of employment which do not debar\r\n     women, but even in these they need protection in securing a fair\r\n     return for their labor. In an investigation conducted by the U.\r\n     S. Department of Labor concerning the wages received by men and\r\n     women it appeared that in 75 per cent. of the 782 instances\r\n     investigated, men received 50 per cent. higher wages than did\r\n     women laboring with the same degree of efficiency on the same\r\n     kind of work.\r\n\r\n     Women also need protection of their property. A man who knows the\r\n     inside truth says, \"Widows and minors are always assessed higher\r\n     than men.\" If the assessor desires re-election, one of the\r\n     easiest methods of securing it is to lower the assessments of the\r\n     politicians who control most voters....\r\n\r\n     Women also want protection for the one sphere which even the most\r\n     conservative loudly proclaim should be theirs--the home. That the\r\n     water supply is good and abundant, that the sewage is carried\r\n     away properly and speedily, that contagious cases are isolated,\r\n     that food is pure in quality and reasonable in price, that\r\n     inspection of food is honest and scientific, that weights and\r\n     measures are true, that gas and electricity are inexpensive, that\r\n     buildings are strongly constructed--these are all matters under\r\n     the control of certain officials elected by voters....\r\n\r\n     Women, too, want protection for the children, proper regulations\r\n     in regard to the schools, the trains at crossings, seducers,\r\n     tramps and child abductors. They want strict laws against obscene\r\n     literature and the unhealthy cigarette; and what is equally\r\n     important, honest enforcement of such laws and ordinances....\r\n\r\n     One class can not, will not, legislate better for all classes\r\n     than they can do for themselves. So men alone can not legislate\r\n     better for women and men than can the two for both. Women need\r\n     the ballot to protect themselves and all that they hold dear.\r\n\r\nThe hearing was closed by Miss Shaw, who said in ending her remarks:\r\n\r\n     Dire results have been predicted at every step of radical\r\n     progress. When women first enjoyed higher education the cry went\r\n     out that the home would be destroyed. It was said that if all the\r\n     women were educated, all would become bluestockings, and if all\r\n     women became bluestockings all would write books, and if all\r\n     women wrote books what would become of the homes, who would rear\r\n     the children? But the schools were opened and women entered them,\r\n     and it has been discovered that the intelligent woman makes a\r\n     wiser mother, a better homemaker and a much more desirable\r\n     companion, friend and wife than a woman who is illiterate, whose\r\n     intellectual horizon is narrowed.\r\n\r\n     In many of the States where the statutes were based on the old\r\n     English common law, the husband absorbed the wife's property as\r\n     he absorbed her personal rights. Then came the demand for\r\n     property rights for wives, but the cry went up they will desert\r\n     their homes. Then it was found there were thousands of women who\r\n     could have no home if they were not permitted to pursue\r\n     avocations in the outside world. And then it was said that the\r\n     moral life of women would be degraded by public contact. Yet the\r\n     statistics show that in those occupations in which women are able\r\n     to earn a livelihood in an honorable and respectable manner they\r\n     have raised the standard of morality rather than lowered it.\r\n\r\n     The results have not been those which were predicted. The homes\r\n     have not been broken up; for human hearts are and always will be\r\n     the same, and so long as God has established in this world a\r\n     greater force than all other forces combined--which we call the\r\n     divine gravity of love--just so long human hearts will continue\r\n     to be drawn together, homes will be founded, families will be\r\n     reared; and never so good a home, never so good a family, as\r\n     those founded in justice and educated upon right principles.\r\n     Consequently the industrial emancipation of women has been of\r\n     benefit to the home, to women and to men.\r\n\r\n     The claim is made that we are building a barrier between men and\r\n     women; that we are antagonistic because men are men and we are\r\n     women. This is not true. We believe there never was a time when\r\n     men and women were such good friends as now, when they esteemed\r\n     each other as they do now. We have coeducation in our schools;\r\n     boys and girls work side by side and study and recite together.\r\n     When coeducation was first tried men thought they would easily\r\n     carry off the honors; but soon they learned their mistake. That\r\n     experience gave to men a better opinion of woman's intellectual\r\n     ability.\r\n\r\n     There is nothing in liberty which can harm either man or woman.\r\n     There is nothing in justice which can work against the highest\r\n     good of humanity; and when on the ground of expediency this\r\n     measure is opposed, in the words of Wendell Phillips, \"Whatever\r\n     is just, God will see that it is expedient.\" There is no greater\r\n     inexpediency than injustice....\r\n\r\n     We do not ask the ballot because we do not believe in men or\r\n     because we think men unjust or unfair. We do not ask to speak for\r\n     ourselves because we believe men unwilling to speak for us; but\r\n     because men by their very nature never can speak for women. It\r\n     would be as impossible for all men to understand the needs of\r\n     women and care for their interests as it would be for all women\r\n     to understand the needs and care for the interests of men. So\r\n     long as laws affect both men and women, both should make the\r\n     laws.\r\n\r\n     Gentlemen, we leave our case with you. I wish those who oppose\r\n     this measure could know the great need of the power of the ballot\r\n     in the hands of those who struggle in the world's affairs. I\r\n     thank you in the name of our association for your kindness in\r\n     listening to us. There will never be laid before you a claim more\r\n     just--one more in accord with the fundamental principles of our\r\n     national life.\r\n\r\nNo one can read the arguments for the enfranchisement of women as\r\npresented before these two committees without a profound conviction of\r\nthe justice of their cause and the imperative duty of those before\r\nwhom they pleaded it to report in favor of submitting the desired\r\namendment. This report would simply have placed the matter before the\r\nrespective Houses of Congress. But neither committee took any action\r\nwhatever and as far as practical results were concerned these eloquent\r\npleas fell upon deaf ears and hardened hearts.\r\n\r\nA unique feature was added to the hearings this year because, for the\r\nfirst time, the advocates of woman suffrage were opposed before the\r\ncommittees by a class of women calling themselves \"remonstrants.\" The\r\n_Woman's Journal_ said:\r\n\r\n     About a dozen women from New York and Massachusetts, with one\r\n     from Delaware, came to Washington and made public speeches before\r\n     Congressional Committees to prove that a woman's place is at\r\n     home. They said they were led to take this action by their alarm\r\n     at the activity of the National-American W. S. A.\r\n\r\n     The party of \"antis\" who came to the Senate hearing in the Marble\r\n     Room would not have been able to get in but for Miss Anthony. As\r\n     this room accommodates only about sixty persons, admission was by\r\n     tickets, and these had been issued to delegates only. The\r\n     \"antis,\" having no tickets, were turned away; but Miss Anthony,\r\n     learning who they were, persuaded the doorkeeper to admit them,\r\n     introduced them herself to the chairman of the committee, and\r\n     placed them in good seats near the front, where they certainly\r\n     heard more about the facts of equal suffrage than they ever did\r\n     before.[129]\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Arthur M. Dodge and Miss Bissell addressed the Senate\r\n     Committee on Woman Suffrage, and Mr. Thomas Russell, Mrs. A. J.\r\n     George, Miss Emily Bissell and Mrs. Rossiter Johnson addressed\r\n     the House Judiciary Committee. In each case they secured the last\r\n     word, to which they were not entitled either by equity or custom,\r\n     by asking to speak at the conclusion of the suffrage hearing. It\r\n     was trying to have to listen to egregious misstatements of fact,\r\n     and to hear the _Woman's Journal_ audaciously cited as authority\r\n     for them, without a chance to reply.\r\n\r\nThe time for these hearings belonged exclusively to the suffrage\r\ndelegates, the chairmen of the two congressional committees stating\r\nthat they would appoint some other day for the \"remonstrants.\" The\r\ndelegates, however, declaring that they had no objections, the \"antis\"\r\nwere permitted to read their papers at the close of the suffrage\r\nhearing, thus having the benefit of the large audiences, but\r\nfurnishing a vast amount of amusement to the suffragists.[130]\r\n\r\nThe _Woman's Journal_ said in its perfectly fair description:\r\n\r\n     The chairman of the House Committee asked Mrs. A. J. George of\r\n     Massachusetts, who conducted the hearing for the \"antis,\" a\r\n     number of questions that she could not answer, and Thomas Russell\r\n     of that State had to prompt her repeatedly. The chairman would\r\n     ask a question; Mrs. George would look nonplussed; Mr. Russell\r\n     would lean over and whisper, \"Say yes,\" and she would answer\r\n     aloud \"Yes.\" The chairman would ask another question; Mr. Russell\r\n     would whisper, \"Say no,\" and Mrs. George would answer \"No.\" This\r\n     happened so often that both the audience and the committee were\r\n     visibly amused, and several persons said it was Mr. Russell who\r\n     was really conducting the hearing. He is a Boston lawyer who has\r\n     conducted the legislative hearings for the \"antis\" in\r\n     Massachusetts for some years.\r\n\r\nMrs. Dodge, in her speech, begged the committee not to allow the\r\n\"purely sentimental reasons of the petitioners\" to have any weight,\r\nand said: \"The mere fact that this amendment is asked as a compliment\r\nto the leading advocate of woman suffrage on the attainment of her\r\neightieth birthday, is evidence of the emotional frame of mind which\r\ninfluences the advocates of the measure, and which is scarcely\r\nfavorable to the calm consideration that should be given to\r\nfundamental political principles.\" Miss Anthony's birthday had not\r\nbeen mentioned by any speaker before either committee, and the\r\nsuffragists under her leadership had been making their pleas and\r\narguments for a Sixteenth Amendment for over thirty years.\r\n\r\nAs the suffrage speakers were not permitted to answer the\r\nmisstatements and prevarications of the \"remonstrants\" at the time of\r\nthe hearings and these were widely circulated through the press, the\r\nconvention passed the following resolutions on motion of Miss Alice\r\nStone Blackwell:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, At this morning's Congressional hearing letters were\r\n     read by the anti-suffragists from two men and one woman in\r\n     Colorado, asserting equal suffrage in that State to be a failure;\r\n     therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we call attention to a published statement\r\n     declaring that the results are wholesome and that none of the\r\n     predicted evils have followed. This statement is signed by the\r\n     Governor and three ex-Governors of Colorado, the Chief Justice,\r\n     all the Judges of the State Supreme Court, the Denver District\r\n     Court and the Court of Appeals; all the Colorado Senators and\r\n     Representatives in Congress; President Slocum of Colorado\r\n     College, the president of the State University, the State\r\n     Superintendent of Public Instruction, the Attorney-General, the\r\n     mayor of Denver, prominent clergymen of different denominations,\r\n     and the presidents of thirteen of the principal women's\r\n     associations of Denver. The social science department of the\r\n     Denver Woman's Club has just voted unanimously to the same\r\n     effect, and the Colorado Legislature lately passed a similar\r\n     resolution by a vote of 45 to 3 in the House and 30 to 1 in the\r\n     Senate. On the other hand, during the six years that equal\r\n     suffrage has prevailed in Colorado the opponents have not yet\r\n     found six respectable men who assert over their own names and\r\n     addresses that it has had any bad results.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, At the Congressional hearing it was asserted that equal\r\n     suffrage had led to no improvements in the laws of Colorado;\r\n     therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we call attention to the fact that Colorado owes\r\n     to equal suffrage the laws raising the age of protection for\r\n     girls to eighteen years; establishing a State Home for Dependent\r\n     Children and a State Industrial School for Girls; making fathers\r\n     and mothers joint guardians of their children; removing the\r\n     emblems from the Australian ballot; prohibiting child labor; also\r\n     city ordinances in Denver providing drinking fountains in the\r\n     streets; forbidding expectoration in public places, and requiring\r\n     the use of smoke-consuming chimneys on all public and business\r\n     buildings.\r\n\r\nThis anecdote was related the next day: \"Miss Anthony's love of the\r\nbeautiful leads her always to clothe herself in good style and fine\r\nmaterials, and she has an eye for the fitness of things as well as for\r\nthe funny side. 'Girls,' she said yesterday, after returning from the\r\nCapitol, 'those statesmen eyed us very closely, but I will wager that\r\nit was impossible after we got mixed together to tell an anti from a\r\nsuffragist by her clothes. There might have been a difference, though,\r\nin the expression of the faces and the shape of the heads,' she added\r\ndrily.\"\r\n\r\nOn Tuesday afternoon about two hundred members of the convention were\r\nreceived by President McKinley in the East Room of the White House.\r\nMiss Anthony stood at his right hand and, after the President had\r\ngreeted the last guest, he invited her to accompany him upstairs to\r\nmeet Mrs. McKinley, who was not well enough to receive all of the\r\nladies. Giving her his arm he led her up the old historic staircase,\r\n\"as tenderly as if he had been my own son,\" she said afterward. When\r\nshe was leaving, after a pleasant call, Mrs. McKinley expressed a wish\r\nto send some message to the convention and she and the President\r\ntogether filled Miss Anthony's arms with white lilies, which graced\r\nthe platform during the remainder of the meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[120] The statistics used in this paper were taken from the report of\r\nthe U. S. Commissioner of Education for 1899.\r\n\r\n[121] See chapter on Louisiana.\r\n\r\n[122] The address of Miss Laughlin created a sensation. A member of\r\nthe United States Labor Commission was in the audience, and was so\r\nmuch impressed with the power of this young woman that shortly\r\nafterwards she was made a member of this commission to investigate the\r\ncondition of the working women of the United States. Her valuable\r\nreport was published in pamphlet form.\r\n\r\n[123] See chapter on Kansas.\r\n\r\n[124] Immediately after the convention, the New York _Times_ published\r\nan alleged interview with Mrs. Paul, in which she was made to say that\r\nshe was not a believer in suffrage for women. She at once denied this\r\nemphatically over her own signature, saying that the interview was a\r\nfabrication and that she was an advocate of the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen especially because of the need of their ballot in city\r\ngovernment.\r\n\r\n[125] This was held the first week in December, 1901, and netted about\r\n$8,000 for the association.\r\n\r\n[126] It will be noticed in this pamphlet that all but one of the\r\nfavorable reports from congressional committees were made during the\r\nyears when Miss Anthony had a winter home at the Riggs House, through\r\nthe courtesy of its proprietors, Mr. and Mrs. C. W. Spofford, and was\r\nable to secure them through personal attention and influence. There\r\nwere always some members of these committees who were favorable to\r\nwoman suffrage, but with the great pressure on every side from other\r\nmatters, this one was apt to be neglected unless somebody made a\r\nbusiness of seeing that it did not go by default. This Miss Anthony\r\ndid for many years, and during this time secured the excellent reports\r\nof 1879, 1882, 1883, 1884, 1886 and 1890. The great speech of Senator\r\nT. W. Palmer, made February 6, 1885, was in response to her insistence\r\nthat he should keep his promise to speak in favor of the question. In\r\n1888-90 Mrs. Upton, who was residing in Washington with her father,\r\nEzra B. Taylor, M. C., did not permit the Judiciary Committee to\r\nforget the report for that year, which was the first and only\r\nfavorable House Report.\r\n\r\n[127] For account of the work of the association before Congress see\r\nChap. I.\r\n\r\n[128] George W. Ray, N. Y., chairman; John J. Jenkins, Wis.; Richard\r\nWayne Parker, N. J.; Jesse Overstreet, Ind.; De Alva S. Alexander, N.\r\nY.; Vespasian Warner, Ill.; Winfield S. Kerr, O.; Charles E.\r\nLittlefield, Me.; Romeo H. Freer, W. Va.; Julius Kahn, Calif.; William\r\nL. Terry, Ark.; David A. De Armond, Mo.; Samuel W. T. Lanham, Tex.;\r\nWilliam Elliott, S. C.; Oscar W. Underwood, Ala.; David H. Smith, Ky.;\r\nWilliam H. Fleming, Ga.\r\n\r\n[129] That this was a mistaken courtesy was proved by subsequent\r\nevents, as afterwards Mrs. Dodge came out with a card in the New York\r\n_Sun_ denying that they were admitted through the intervention of Miss\r\nAnthony.\r\n\r\n[130] In the official Senate report of the hearing the arguments of\r\nthe suffragists filled forty pages; those of the \"antis\" five pages.\r\nThey consisted of brief papers by Mrs. Dodge and Miss Bissell. The\r\nformer took the ground that the Congress should leave this matter to\r\nbe decided by the States; that women are not physically qualified to\r\nuse the ballot; and that its use by them would render \"domestic\r\ntranquillity\" a byword among the people. Miss Bissell began by saying,\r\n\"It is not the tyranny but the chivalry of men that we have to fear,\"\r\nand opposed the suffrage principally because the majority of women do\r\nnot want it, saying, \"I have never yet been so situated that I could\r\nsee where a vote could help me. If I felt that it would, I might\r\nbecome a suffragist perhaps.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXI.\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL-AMERICAN CONVENTION OF 1900 CONTINUED.\r\n\r\n\r\nIt had been known for some time before the suffrage convention of Feb.\r\n8-14, 1900, that Miss Anthony intended to resign the presidency of the\r\nnational association at that time, when she would be eighty years old,\r\nbut her devoted adherents could not resist urging that she would\r\nreconsider her decision. When they assembled, however, they found it\r\nimpossible to persuade her to continue longer in the office. The\r\nWashington _Post_ of February 8 said:\r\n\r\n     Miss Susan B. Anthony has resigned. The woman who for the greater\r\n     part of her life has been the star that guided the National Woman\r\n     Suffrage Association through all of its vicissitudes until it\r\n     stands to-day a living monument to her wonderful mental and\r\n     physical ability has turned over the leadership to younger minds\r\n     and hands, not because this great woman feels that she is no\r\n     longer capable of exercising it, but because she has a still\r\n     larger work to accomplish before her life's labors are at an end.\r\n     In a speech which was characteristic of one who has done so much\r\n     toward the uplifting of her sex, Miss Anthony tendered her\r\n     resignation during the preliminary meeting of the executive\r\n     committee, held last night at the headquarters in the parlors of\r\n     the Riggs House.\r\n\r\n     Although Miss Anthony had positively stated that she would resign\r\n     in 1900, there were many of those present who were visibly\r\n     shocked when she announced that she was about to relinquish her\r\n     position as president of the association. In the instant hush\r\n     which followed this statement a sorrow settled over the\r\n     countenances of the fifty women seated about the room, who love\r\n     and venerate Miss Anthony so much, and probably some of them\r\n     would have broken down had it not been that they knew well her\r\n     antipathy to public emotion. In a happy vein, which soon drove\r\n     the clouds of disappointment from the faces of those present, she\r\n     explained why she no longer desired to continue as an officer of\r\n     the association after having done so since its beginning.\r\n\r\n     \"I have fully determined,\" she began, \"to retire from the active\r\n     presidency of the association. I was elected assistant secretary\r\n     of a woman suffrage society in 1852, and from that day to this\r\n     have always held an office. I am not retiring now because I feel\r\n     unable, mentally or physically, to do the necessary work, but\r\n     because I wish to see the organization in the hands of those who\r\n     are to have its management in the future.\" Then jestingly she\r\n     continued: \"I want to see you all at work, while I am alive, so I\r\n     can scold if you do not do it well. Give the matter of selecting\r\n     your officers serious thought. Consider who will do the best work\r\n     for the political enfranchisement of women, and let no personal\r\n     feelings enter into the question.\"\r\n\r\nWhile Miss Anthony seemed at the height of her physical and mental\r\nvigor, those who loved her best felt it to be right that she should be\r\nrelieved of the burdens of the office which were growing heavier each\r\nyear as the demands upon the association became more numerous, and\r\nshould be free to devote her time to certain lines of work which could\r\nbe done only by herself. They tried to imitate her own cheerfulness\r\nand philosophy in this matter, but found it more difficult than it\r\never before had been to follow where she led.\r\n\r\nThe last of the resolutions, presented to the convention a few days\r\nlater by the chairman of the committee, Henry B. Blackwell, read as\r\nfollows: \"In view of the announced determination of Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony to withdraw from the presidency of this association, we tender\r\nher our heartfelt expression of appreciation and regard. We\r\ncongratulate her upon her eightieth birthday, and trust that she will\r\nadd to her past illustrious services her aid and support to the\r\nyounger workers for woman's enfranchisement. We shall continue to look\r\nto her for advice and counsel in the years to come. May the new\r\ncentury witness the fruition of our labors.\"\r\n\r\nThis was unanimously adopted by a rising vote. Observing that many of\r\nthe delegates were on the point of yielding to their feelings, Miss\r\nAnthony arose and in clear, even tones, with a touch of quaint humor,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     I wish you could realize with what joy and relief I retire from\r\n     the presidency. I want to say this to you while I am still\r\n     alive--and I am good yet for another decade--don't be afraid. As\r\n     long as my name stands at the head, I am Yankee enough to feel\r\n     that I must watch every potato which goes into the dinner-pot and\r\n     supervise every detail of the work. For the four years since I\r\n     fixed my date to retire, I have constantly been saying to myself,\r\n     \"Let go, let go, let go!\" I am now going to let go of the\r\n     machinery but not of the spiritual part. I expect to do more work\r\n     for woman suffrage in the next decade than ever before. I have\r\n     not been for nearly fifty years in this movement without gaining\r\n     a certain \"notoriety,\" at least, and this enables me to get a\r\n     hearing before the annual conventions of many great national\r\n     bodies, and to urge on them the passage of resolutions asking\r\n     Congress to submit to the State Legislatures a Sixteenth\r\n     Amendment to the Federal Constitution forbidding disfranchisement\r\n     on account of sex. This is a part of the work to which I mean to\r\n     devote myself henceforward. Then you all know about the big fund\r\n     which I am going to raise so that you young workers may have an\r\n     assured income and not have to spend the most of your time\r\n     begging money, as I have had to do.\r\n\r\nThe convention proceeded to the election of officers. Mrs. Lillie\r\nDevereux Blake (N. Y.), who was a candidate for president, asked\r\npermission to make a personal explanation and said: \"I have received\r\nfrom many parts of the United States expressions of regard and esteem\r\nthat have deeply touched me. But in the interests of harmony I desire\r\nto withdraw my name from any consideration you may have wished to give\r\nme.\" Of the 278 votes cast for president Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt (N.\r\nY.) received 254; eleven of the remaining twenty-four were cast for\r\nMiss Anthony and ten for Mrs. Blake. The other members of the old\r\nboard were re-elected almost unanimously.[131]\r\n\r\nThe Washington _Post_ said: \"There was a touching scene when the vote\r\nfor Mrs. Chapman Catt was announced. First there was an outburst of\r\napplause, and then as though all at once every one realized that she\r\nwas witnessing the passing of Susan B. Anthony, their beloved\r\npresident, the deepest silence prevailed for several seconds. Lifelong\r\nmembers of the association, who had toiled and struggled by the side\r\nof Miss Anthony, could not restrain their emotions and wept in spite\r\nof their efforts at control.\" The Washington _Star_ thus described the\r\noccasion:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Blake not being in the hall, Miss Anthony was made a\r\n     committee of one to present Mrs. Catt to the convention. The\r\n     women went wild as, erect and alert, she walked to the front of\r\n     the platform, holding the hand of her young co-worker, of whom\r\n     she is extremely fond and of whom she expects great things. Miss\r\n     Anthony's eyes were tear-dimmed, and her tones were uneven, as\r\n     she presented to the convention its choice of a leader in words\r\n     freighted with love and tender solicitude, rich with\r\n     reminiscences of the past, and full of hope for the future of the\r\n     new president and her work.\r\n\r\n     \"Suffrage is no longer a theory, but an actual condition,\" she\r\n     said, \"and new occasions bring new duties. These new duties,\r\n     these changed conditions, demand stronger hands, younger heads\r\n     and fresher hearts. In Mrs. Catt you have my ideal leader. I\r\n     present to you my successor.\"\r\n\r\n     By this time half the women were using their handkerchiefs on\r\n     their eyes and the other half were waving them in the air.\r\n\r\nThe object of all this praise stood with downcast eyes and evidently\r\nwas deeply moved. At length she said in response:\r\n\r\n     Good friends, I should hardly be human if I did not feel\r\n     gratitude and appreciation for the confidence you have shown me;\r\n     but I feel the honor of the position much less than its\r\n     responsibility. I never was an aspirant for it. I consented only\r\n     six weeks ago to stand. I was not willing to be the next\r\n     president after Miss Anthony. I have known that there was a\r\n     general loyalty to her which could not be given to any younger\r\n     worker. Since Miss Anthony announced her intention to retire,\r\n     there have been editorials in many leading papers expressing\r\n     approval of her--but not of the cause. She has been much larger\r\n     than our association. The papers have spoken of the new president\r\n     as Miss Anthony's successor. Miss Anthony never will have a\r\n     successor.\r\n\r\n     A president chosen from the younger generation is on a level with\r\n     the association, and it might suffer in consequence of Miss\r\n     Anthony's retirement if we did not still have her to counsel and\r\n     advise us. I pledge you whatever ability God has given me, but I\r\n     can not do this work alone. The cause has got beyond where one\r\n     woman can do the whole. I shall not be its leader as Miss Anthony\r\n     has been; I shall be only an officer of this association. I will\r\n     do all I can, but I can not do it without the co-operation of\r\n     each of you. The responsibility much overbalances the honor, and\r\n     I hope you will all help me bear the burden.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT.\r\n\r\nSuccessor of Miss Susan B. Anthony as President of National-American\r\nWoman Suffrage Association.]\r\n\r\nIt was voted on motion of Mrs. Rachel Foster Avery to make Miss\r\nAnthony honorary president, which was done with applause and she\r\nobserved informally: \"You have moved me up higher. I always did stand\r\nby Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and my name always was after hers, and I am\r\nglad to be there again.\"\r\n\r\nThe press notices said of the new officer:\r\n\r\n     Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, the newly-elected president of the\r\n     National Suffrage Association, is a young and handsome woman with\r\n     a charming personality, and is one of the most eloquent and\r\n     logical speakers upon the public platform. For the past five\r\n     years she has been lecturer and organizer for the association,\r\n     where she has shown rare executive ability and earnestness of\r\n     purpose.\r\n\r\n     She has traveled from east to west and from north to south many\r\n     times, lectured in nearly every city in the Union and has been\r\n     associated with every important victory that equal suffrage has\r\n     won of late years. She was in Colorado during the amendment\r\n     campaign, and the women attribute their success to her more than\r\n     to any other person from outside the State. She was in Idaho,\r\n     where all four political parties put suffrage planks into their\r\n     platforms and the amendment carried. She went before the\r\n     Louisiana constitutional convention, by the earnest invitation of\r\n     New Orleans women, and it gave tax-paying women the right to vote\r\n     upon all questions submitted to the tax-payers.\r\n\r\nIt had been known for several years that Mrs. Chapman Catt was Miss\r\nAnthony's choice as her successor; she was considered the\r\nbest-equipped woman in the association for the position, and the vote\r\nof the delegates showed how nearly unanimous was her election. The\r\nRev. Anna Howard Shaw, who for a number of years had been\r\nvice-president-at-large, could have had Miss Anthony's sanction and\r\nthe unanimous vote of the convention if she would have consented to\r\naccept the office.\r\n\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt opened the next day's meeting by saying:\r\n\r\n     A surprise was promised as part of this afternoon's program and a\r\n     pleasant duty now falls to me. It is to present Miss Anthony with\r\n     the spirit of a gift, for the gift itself is not here. Suffrage\r\n     people from all over the world go to see Miss Anthony at her home\r\n     in Rochester, N. Y., and consequently the carpets of the parlor\r\n     and sitting-room are getting a little worn. When she goes home\r\n     she will find two beautiful Smyrna rugs fitting the floors of\r\n     those two rooms--the gift of her suffrage friends. I am also\r\n     commissioned to present her with an album. Some of our naughty\r\n     officers have been making fun of it and saying that albums are\r\n     all out of date; but this one contains the photographs of all the\r\n     presidents of the State Suffrage Associations, and the chairmen\r\n     of standing committees. No collection of \"antis\" could be found\r\n     that would present in their faces as much intelligence and\r\n     strength of character.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony expressed her thanks, and said: \"These girls have\r\ndisproved the old saying that a secret can not be kept by a woman, for\r\nI have not heard a word of a rug or a picture.\"\r\n\r\nFrom the Utah Silk Commission composed of women came a handsome black\r\nbrocaded dress pattern, the work of women, from the tending of the\r\ncocoons to the weaving of the silk. A beautiful solid silver vase was\r\npresented from \"the free women of Idaho.\" There was also from this\r\nState an album of two hundred pages of pen drawings, water colors and\r\npressed flowers, with a sentiment on each page, the contributions of\r\nas many individuals. California sent more than one hundred dollars.\r\nFrom every State came gifts of money, silver-plate, fine china, sofa\r\ncushions, books, pictures, exquisite jewelry, lace, chatelaine bags\r\nand every token which loving hearts could devise. To each Miss Anthony\r\nresponded with a terse sentence or two, half tender, half humorous;\r\nthe audience entered fully into the spirit of it all, and the\r\nconvention was like a big family enjoying the birthday of one of its\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nOf the last session on February 14, the Washington _Post_ said:\r\n\r\n     A vast audience consisting of both men and women witnessed at the\r\n     Church of Our Father, last evening, the passing of Susan B.\r\n     Anthony as president of the National Suffrage Association. It was\r\n     the final evening session of the Thirty-second annual convention,\r\n     which, Miss Anthony announced at its close, had been the most\r\n     successful from every point of view of any ever held.\r\n\r\n     Long before the opening hour arrived the church was completely\r\n     filled, and people stood eight and ten deep in the aisles, sat\r\n     around the edge of the speakers' platform and filled the\r\n     approaches to the church. Miss Anthony and many of the other\r\n     speakers, who arrived at eight o'clock, had great difficulty in\r\n     reaching the platform.\r\n\r\nJohn C. Bell, member of Congress from Colorado, made the opening\r\naddress in which he said: \"The greatest obstruction to human progress\r\nis human prejudice. As long as men are controlled more by their\r\nprejudices than by their reason, they will be slaves to habit. If\r\nwomen had voted from the foundation of the Government it would now be\r\nas difficult to deprive them of this privilege as it would be to\r\nrepeal the Bill of Rights, but as the men have done the voting from\r\nthe beginning, the force of habit is successfully battling with both\r\nreason and justice.\" He refuted the charge that woman suffrage made\r\ndissension in families, saying: \"You must bear in mind that the\r\nextending of the elective franchise to women not only elevates and\r\nbroadens them but the men as well.\"\r\n\r\nThe address of Mrs. Blatch on Woman and War was among the most notable\r\nof the convention. She declared that one of the good effects of war\r\nwas that \"it made women work.\" The _Post_ said: \"Mrs. Harriot Stanton\r\nBlatch, a daughter of Elizabeth Cady Stanton, whose present home is in\r\nEngland, laid the blame of all the British reverses in the Transvaal\r\nat the door of what she termed 'the evils of an idle aristocracy.' In\r\na most dramatic manner she denounced the course of the British Empire.\r\nAfter summing up the war situation she said: 'The English armies now\r\non the battle-fields in the Transvaal have at their heads as officers\r\nsons of this idle aristocracy, who through their incompetency are not\r\nfit to be leaders. They are beneath contempt, but to the English\r\nsoldier all honor is due. He is all right.'\"\r\n\r\nThe speech of the pioneer Quaker suffragist, Mrs. Caroline Hallowell\r\nMiller (Md.), delighted the audience, and her comparison of Abraham\r\nLincoln and Susan B. Anthony, \"both having devoted their lives to\r\nfreedom,\" was enthusiastically received. Then occurred one of the\r\npleasant diversions so characteristic of these suffrage conventions.\r\nDuring the interval while the collection was being taken, Mrs. Helen\r\nMosher James, niece of Miss Anthony, stepping to the front of the\r\nplatform, said: \"This is the Rev. Anna Shaw's birthday. Her friends\r\nwish to present her with an easy chair to await her when she comes\r\nback wearied from going up and down the land, satchel in hand, on her\r\nmany lecture tours. Here are fifty-three gold dollars, one for each\r\nyear of her life, and we wish her to buy such a chair as suits her\r\nbest.\"\r\n\r\nIn response the little minister said in part: \"I am not like Miss\r\nAnthony, so used to having gifts poured in upon me that I know just\r\nwhat to say. I shall buy the chair when I have been told what is the\r\ncorrect thing to buy by another niece of Miss Anthony's, who for\r\ntwelve years has made a home for me. If you want to see a pretty\r\nlittle spot, come to our home, and every one of you shall sit in _our_\r\nchair.\"[132]\r\n\r\nThen Miss Anthony, clasping the hand of Mrs. Chapman Catt, led her\r\nforward and introduced her to the audience as \"president of the\r\nNational-American Woman Suffrage Association.\" The _Woman's Journal_\r\nthus described the occasion:\r\n\r\n     She was received with immense applause, the great audience rising\r\n     and waving handkerchiefs. She spoke on The Three I's, showing how\r\n     every effort of women for improvement was called, first,\r\n     indelicate, then immodest, and finally impracticable, but how all\r\n     the old objections had been proved to be, in legal phrase,\r\n     \"incompetent, irrelevant and immaterial.\"\r\n\r\n     The woman's rights agitation began in the early days of the\r\n     republic, and a moral warfare along that line has been waged for\r\n     more than a hundred years. Each step has been fiercely contested.\r\n     The advocates of every claim have been lovers of justice and the\r\n     opponents have been adherents of conservatism. The warfare has\r\n     been waged in three distinct battles, the weapon of the opponents\r\n     always being ridicule, that of the defenders, appeals to reason.\r\n\r\n     In the early days, when colleges and public schools were closed\r\n     to women and the education of girls was confined to the three\r\n     R's, an agitation was begun to permit them to take more advanced\r\n     studies. Society received it with the cry \"indelicate.\" At that\r\n     time delicacy was the choicest charm of woman and indelicacy was\r\n     a crushing criticism. But the battle was won.\r\n\r\n     The second great battle occurred between 1850 and 1860. Upon\r\n     every hand incorrigible woman, with a big W, arose to irritate\r\n     and torment the conservatives of the world. She appeared in the\r\n     pulpit, on the platform, in conventions, in new occupations and\r\n     in innumerable untried fields. Everywhere the finger of scorn was\r\n     pointed at her, and the world with merciless derision pronounced\r\n     her immodest. But that battle was won.\r\n\r\n     We are now in the heat of the greatest of all battles. Woman asks\r\n     for the suffrage. The world answers, \"impractical.\" We are told\r\n     that this movement is quite different from all others because\r\n     there is an organized opposition of women themselves against it,\r\n     but the \"remonstrant\" is not new. This century has witnessed ten\r\n     generations of remonstrants. In 1800 the remonstrant was\r\n     horrified at the study of geography. In 1810 she accepted\r\n     geography but protested against physiology. In 1820 she accepted\r\n     physiology but protested against geometry. In 1830 she accepted\r\n     geometry but protested against the college education. In 1840 she\r\n     accepted the college but remonstrated against the property laws\r\n     for married women. In 1850 she accepted the property laws but\r\n     remonstrated against public speaking. In 1860 she protested\r\n     against the freedom of organization. In 1870 she remonstrated\r\n     against the professions for women. In 1880 she protested against\r\n     school suffrage. In 1890 she protested against women in office.\r\n     In 1900 she accepts everything that every former generation of\r\n     remonstrants has protested against and, availing herself of the\r\n     privilege of free public speech secured by this women's rights\r\n     movement, pleads publicly that she may be saved from the burden\r\n     of voting.\r\n\r\n     The remonstrant of 1800 said \"indelicate,\" of 1850 \"immodest,\" of\r\n     1900 \"impractical.\" That the forces of conservatism will\r\n     surrender as unconditionally to the forces of justice in the\r\n     great battle of the impractical as they did in the battle of the\r\n     indelicate and of the immodest is as inevitable as that the sun\r\n     will rise tomorrow.\r\n\r\nAt the close of her fine address, of which this is the barest\r\nsynopsis, Miss Anthony came forward and asked triumphantly, \"Do you\r\nthink the three hundred delegates made a mistake in choosing that\r\nwoman for president?\"--a question which brought out renewed applause.\r\nShe then introduced to the audience the other officers, all of whom\r\nexcept Mrs. McCulloch had served in their present capacity from eight\r\nto ten years, Mrs. Avery having been corresponding secretary twenty\r\nyears. They were enthusiastically greeted. Afterwards she presented\r\nMiss Clara Barton, the president of the Red Cross Association, an\r\nearnest advocate of suffrage, and as the cheers for her rang out, Miss\r\nAnthony observed, \"Politically her opinion is worth no more than an\r\nidiot's.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony came forward at the close of the program and, the\r\naudience realizing that she was about to say good-bye, there was the\r\nmost profound stillness, with every eye and ear strained to the utmost\r\ntension. A woman who loved the theatrical and posed for effect would\r\nhave taken advantage of this opportunity to create a dramatic scene\r\nand make her exit in the midst of tears and lamentations, but nothing\r\ncould be further from Miss Anthony's nature. Her voice rang out as\r\nstrong and true as if making an old-time speech on the rights of\r\nwomen, with only one little break in it, and she covered this up by\r\nsaying quickly, \"Not one of our national officers ever has had a\r\ndollar of salary. I retire on full pay!\"\r\n\r\nThe Washington _Post_ said of this occasion:\r\n\r\n     The convention closed its labors with the farewell address of\r\n     Miss Anthony. The retiring president paid a magnificent tribute\r\n     to the faithful women whose aid and loyal companionship she had\r\n     enjoyed for so many years. Emphatically she declared that she\r\n     was not going to give up her efforts in behalf of that for which\r\n     she had struggled so long, and concluded: \"I am grateful to this\r\n     association; I am grateful to you all, and to the world, for the\r\n     great kindness which has been mine. To-morrow I will have\r\n     finished fourscore years. I have lived to rise from the most\r\n     despised and hated woman in all the world of fifty years ago,\r\n     until now it seems as if I am loved by you all. If this is true,\r\n     then I am indeed satisfied.\"\r\n\r\n     Miss Anthony lost control of her voice for a moment. She soon\r\n     regained her composure, however, and, calling the officers of the\r\n     association to her side, she told of what each individual had\r\n     done for the organization. It was a pretty picture. The audience\r\n     caught the spirit of determination from Miss Anthony and a\r\n     thunderous applause and waving of handkerchiefs followed.\r\n\r\nThe great crowd sang the doxology and even then seemed unwilling to\r\ndisperse, hundreds of people staying for a hand-shake and a few\r\npersonal words with the officers and delegates.\r\n\r\nThe day following the close of the convention was the eightieth\r\nanniversary of Miss Anthony's birth, and many suffrage advocates from\r\ndifferent parts of the country had come to the national capital to\r\nassist in celebrating it. The following program was handsomely\r\nprepared for distribution and was carried out, except that Mrs. Birney\r\nand Dr. Smith were unavoidably absent.\r\n\r\n  CELEBRATION OF THE EIGHTIETH BIRTHDAY\r\n  OF\r\n  SUSAN B.

CLAY, Kentucky.\r\n               RACHEL FOSTER AVERY, Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nEvery large newspaper in the country had a description of what might\r\nbe properly considered an event of national interest. The Washington\r\n_Post_ said: \"The program, though a long one, was replete throughout\r\nwith stirring tributes to Miss Anthony's great career. Eloquent women\r\nwho ascribed the opportunities which they had been allowed to enjoy to\r\nthe tremendous effort to which their beloved leader had devoted her\r\nwhole life, stood before the audience and voiced their sentiments.\r\nTears and applause mingled swiftly as the voices of the speakers rang\r\nthrough the theater, recounting the hardships, the struggles, and at\r\nlast the crowning achievements of the woman whose eightieth birthday\r\nwas being celebrated.\"\r\n\r\nThe _Woman's Tribune_ thus began its report:\r\n\r\n     There never has been before and, in the nature of things, there\r\n     can never be again, a personal celebration having the significant\r\n     relation to the woman suffrage movement which marked that of Miss\r\n     Anthony's eightieth birthday. When Mrs. Stanton's eightieth\r\n     birthday was celebrated five years ago she had already retired\r\n     from the active leadership of the organization; the program was\r\n     in charge of the National Council of Women and was largely in the\r\n     nature of a jubilee for the whole woman movement, although\r\n     rallying around Mrs. Stanton as a center. Lucretia Mott's\r\n     eightieth birthday came before the movement had gained the\r\n     impetus necessary for such a celebration. Lucy Stone passed on in\r\n     1893 before reaching this ripe age, and now there is no one left\r\n     in the lead who represents the earliest stage of the work but\r\n     Miss Anthony.\r\n\r\n     It was the fairest and sunniest day of all the good convention\r\n     weather, and Lafayette Opera House was full to the remotest part\r\n     of its fourth gallery with invited guests when Mrs. Chapman Catt\r\n     opened the program at 3 o'clock. On the stage were the Birthday\r\n     Committee, a large number of persons who had been thirty years or\r\n     more in the work, relatives of Miss Anthony and the national\r\n     officers. Miss Anthony's entrance while the Ladies' Mandolin Club\r\n     were playing was greeted with long-continued applause.\r\n\r\n     John W. Hutchinson was first introduced. After stating that he\r\n     had known Miss Anthony for fifty-five years, had attended in Ohio\r\n     in 1850 the second suffrage convention ever held, and had always\r\n     sympathized with the cause, he sang with a clear, far-reaching\r\n     voice a song composed by himself.\r\n\r\n     The presiding officer stated that the gains of the last\r\n     half-century in all lines relating to women were largely due to\r\n     the guest of the occasion and her fellow-workers, and said: \"When\r\n     Miss Anthony began her labors there were practically no\r\n     organizations of women; now they are numbered by thousands. The\r\n     crown of the whole is the union of all organizations, the\r\n     National Council of Women. Its president will now address us.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gaffney said in her tribute:\r\n\r\n     ....The Christian world reckoned by centuries is just coming of\r\n     age. Therefore women are beginning to put away childish things\r\n     and to realize the greatness of womanhood. They have had to let\r\n     ideals wait. They submitted to conditions because they were\r\n     afraid that if they did not man would take to the woods and\r\n     become again a wild barbarian. They were flattered by the fact\r\n     that men liked them as they were, and they failed to realize that\r\n     their power to civilize was God-given.\r\n\r\n     They needed a leader to rally them, to give them the courage of\r\n     their convictions; and such a leader Miss Anthony has been. She\r\n     spoke to the world in tones which rang out so clear and true that\r\n     they will echo down the centuries. Some who had been protected\r\n     and petted were slow to rally; others who had broader views\r\n     accepted sooner the doctrine of rights--not privileges--of rights\r\n     for all women. Miss Anthony taught us the sisterhood of woman,\r\n     and that the privileges of one class could not offset the wrongs\r\n     of another....\r\n\r\nMrs. Sewall, president of the International Council of Women, composed\r\nof the Councils of thirteen nations, and the largest organization of\r\nwomen in the world, said in part:\r\n\r\n     It is proper that the International Council should remember today\r\n     \"to render unto Cæsar the things that are Cæsar's,\" and to pay\r\n     tribute to the organization which it may not regard as other than\r\n     its direct progenitor. There are certain incidents, simple in\r\n     themselves, in which probably the actors are always at the time\r\n     quite unconscious of their perennial significance, and yet which\r\n     become landmarks in the evolution of the human spirit. Such are\r\n     Thermopylæ and Marathon and Bunker Hill. Such was that first\r\n     convention at Seneca Falls.... The light from that meeting,\r\n     springing from a vital source, has vitalized every point it has\r\n     touched. Other torches lit by that have become beacon lights, and\r\n     every one has stood for the illumination of women....\r\n\r\n     In the name and in the blended tongues of the women of the\r\n     different nationalities who belong to the International Council,\r\n     I salute and congratulate you.... I beg the proud honor of\r\n     placing your name, Miss Anthony, among the list of Patrons of the\r\n     Council as a birthday gift, where it shall one day be pronounced\r\n     in every language....\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Ida C. Hultin brought the gratitude of the ministers, saying:\r\n\r\n     ....Women have failed to see that the work of every woman has\r\n     touched that of every other. The woman who works with the hand\r\n     helps her who works with the brain. To-day we know there could be\r\n     no choice of work until there was freedom of choice to work. O,\r\n     beloved leader, we of the ministry, as they of all ministries of\r\n     service, bring our greetings and benediction. I hear the voices\r\n     which shall tell of the new gospel and among them are the glad\r\n     tones of women and the intonations of this one who spake in\r\n     tears, who dared to speak before other tongues were loosed. Years\r\n     will never silence that voice. Woman in her highest moods will\r\n     catch the cadence of its melody and in the future there shall be\r\n     that which will work back and forth to the enlightenment of the\r\n     world because you have lived and ever shall live....\r\n\r\nMiss Hirschler thus closed the tribute of her profession: \"In the\r\ngenerations to come when courts of law shall have become courts of\r\njustice, women lawyers will think of Susan B. Anthony as one who paved\r\nthe way and made this possible.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Hollister said in part: \"Miss Anthony has opened the portals of\r\nactivities; has dignified labor; has made it possible for women to\r\nmanage their own affairs--four millions to-day earning independent\r\nincomes. Women have given their lives for philanthropies and reforms,\r\nbut the one we honor to-day gave hers for woman. Olive Schreiner tells\r\nof an artist who painted a wonderful picture and none could learn what\r\npigments he used. When he died a wound was found over his heart; he\r\nhad painted his masterpiece with his own blood. Such women as Miss\r\nAnthony are painting their masterpieces with their life's blood.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Cook, with a dignity and simplicity which won the audience, said:\r\n\r\n     ....It is fitting on this occasion, when the hearts of women the\r\n     world over are turned to this day and hour, that the colored\r\n     women of the United States should join in the expressions of love\r\n     and praise offered to Miss Anthony upon her eightieth birthday.\r\n     ....She is to us not only the high priestess of woman's cause,\r\n     but the courageous defender of rights wherever assailed.\r\n\r\n     We hold in high esteem her strong and noble womanhood, for in her\r\n     untiring zeal, her uncompromising stand for justice to women, her\r\n     unfailing friendship for all good work, she herself is a stronger\r\n     and better argument in favor of woman's rights than the most\r\n     gifted orator could put into words. When she first championed\r\n     woman's cause, humiliation followed her footsteps and injustice\r\n     barred the door of her progress among even the most favored\r\n     classes of society; while among less enlightened and enslaved\r\n     classes the wrongs which woman suffered were too terrible to\r\n     mention. Carlyle has said, \"Beware when the great God lets loose\r\n     a thinker upon this earth.\" When Susan B. Anthony was born, a\r\n     thinker was \"let loose.\" Her voice and her pen have lighted a\r\n     torch whose sacred fire, like that of some old Roman temples,\r\n     dies not, but whose penetrating ray shall brighten the path of\r\n     women down the long line of ages yet to come. Our children and\r\n     our children's children will be taught to honor her memory, for\r\n     they shall be told that she has been always in the vanguard of\r\n     the immortal few who have stood for the great principles of human\r\n     rights. Grander than any achievement that has crowned the work of\r\n     woman in this woman's century has been that which has led her\r\n     away from the narrow valley of custom and prejudice up to the\r\n     lofty height where she can accept the Divine teaching that \"God\r\n     hath made of one blood all nations of men.\"\r\n\r\n     Not until the suffrage movement had awakened woman to her\r\n     responsibility and power, did she come to appreciate the true\r\n     significance of Christ's pity for Magdalene as well as of His\r\n     love for Mary; not till then was the work of Pundita Ramabai in\r\n     far away India as sacred as that of Frances Willard at home in\r\n     America; not till she had suffered under the burden of her own\r\n     wrongs and abuses did she realize the all-important truth that no\r\n     woman and no class of women can be degraded and all womankind not\r\n     suffer thereby.\r\n\r\n     And so, Miss Anthony, in behalf of the hundreds of colored women\r\n     who wait and hope with you for the day when the ballot shall be\r\n     in the hands of every intelligent woman; and also in behalf of\r\n     the thousands who sit in darkness and whose condition we shall\r\n     expect those ballots to better, whether they be in the hands of\r\n     white women or black, I offer you my warmest gratitude and\r\n     congratulations.\r\n\r\nMrs. Thompson presented $200 from the District of Columbia, with the\r\nfollowing affectionate tribute:\r\n\r\n     ....In behalf of the Suffragists of the District of Columbia,\r\n     both men and women, I am happy to say I am deputized to present\r\n     to you a gift which expresses their regard and love for you as\r\n     well as their appreciation of the almost superhuman efforts you\r\n     have made for the past fifty years to secure justice and civil\r\n     and political equality for women.\r\n\r\n     The gift is in the form of what is often called \"the sinews of\r\n     war\"--money. Not coarse, dead cash, such as passes from hand to\r\n     hand in everyday transactions, but money every penny of which is\r\n     alive with sincere thanks and earnest, loving wishes for\r\n     happiness and continued success in all your endeavors....\r\n\r\n     We do not hail you, love you, as one who has made woman's life\r\n     easier, strewn it with more rose leaves of idleness, shielded it\r\n     from more stress and storm, but as one who has taken the grander,\r\n     truer view, that by equally sharing stress and storm, by equal\r\n     effort and work, by equality in rights, privileges, powers and\r\n     opportunities with her other self--man--woman will evolve and\r\n     will reach her loftiest, loveliest development. Not as an apostle\r\n     of ease, parasitism and shrinking fear do we regard you, but as\r\n     the apostle, the incarnation, of work, of high courage and\r\n     deathless endeavor.\r\n\r\n     We wish our gift were myriad-fold greater, but it would never\r\n     express more appreciation of what you stand for and what you\r\n     are--a _Liberator of Woman_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Helen M. Warren, wife of the Senator from Wyoming, speaking in a\r\nfine, resonant voice which would do credit to any legislative hall,\r\nread the poem written by Miss Phoebe Cary for the celebration of Miss\r\nAnthony's fiftieth birthday, presented her with a brooch, a little\r\nAmerican flag, made of gold and jewels, and said: \"I feel honored on\r\nthis, your eightieth birthday, to represent the State of Wyoming which\r\nhas espoused your cause for more than thirty years. I have in my hand\r\na flag, which bears on its field forty-one _common_ stars and four\r\ndiamonds, representing the four progressive or suffrage\r\nStates--Wyoming, the banner State; Colorado, Utah and Idaho. The back\r\nof the flag bears this inscription: 'Miss Anthony. From the ladies of\r\nWyoming, who love and revere you. Many happy returns of the day.\r\n1820-1900.' We hope you may live to see all the common stars turn into\r\ndiamonds. With kindly greetings from Wyoming I present you this\r\nexpression of her esteem.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Shafroth, wife of the Representative from Colorado, presented a\r\ngift designed and made by the women of her State, saying: \"It is with\r\ngreat pleasure that I bring you the greeting from the sun-kissed land\r\nof the West, where the flag which we all love, and of which we all\r\nsing, really waves over the land of the free and the home of the\r\nbrave. Our men are brave and generous and our women are free. You and\r\nyour noble co-workers stormed the heights of ridicule and prejudice to\r\nwin this freedom for woman. In behalf of our Non-Partisan Equal\r\nSuffrage Association, I beg you to accept this 'loving cup' of\r\nColorado silver.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Emily S. Richards brought the affectionate greetings of the women\r\nof Utah, and Mrs. Chapman Catt referred to the loving testimonials\r\nwhich had been sent by the Idaho women.[133] Then after an exquisite\r\nviolin solo by Mr. Douglass, she said: \"The liberties of the citizens\r\nof the future will be still more an outgrowth of this movement than\r\nthose of the present,\" and to the delighted surprise of the audience\r\nthe following scene occurred, as described by the _Post_:\r\n\r\n     The most beautiful and touching part of the program was when\r\n     eighty little children, boys and girls, passed in single file\r\n     across the stage, each bearing a rose. Slowly they marched,\r\n     keeping time to music, and, as they reached the spot where Miss\r\n     Anthony sat, each child deposited a blossom in her lap, a rose\r\n     for every year. It was a surprise so complete, so wonderfully\r\n     beautiful, that for a few moments she could do nothing more than\r\n     grasp the hand of each child. Then she began kissing the little\r\n     people, and the applause which greeted this act was deafening.\r\n     The roses were distributed among the pioneers at the close of the\r\n     exercises by her request.\r\n\r\nMrs. Coonley-Ward of Chicago gave an eloquent poem, entitled Love's\r\nRosary, which closed as follows:\r\n\r\n    Behold our Queen! Surely with heart elate\r\n      At homage given to her love and power,\r\n    World-famed associate of the wise and great,\r\n      She is herself the woman of the hour.\r\n\r\n    How kindly have the years all dealt with her!\r\n      She proves that Bible promises are true;\r\n    She waited on the Lord without demur,\r\n      And He failed not her courage to renew.\r\n\r\n    Oft on the wings of eagles she uprose;\r\n      On mercy's errands have her glad feet run;\r\n    And yet no sign of weariness she shows;\r\n      She does not faint, but works from sun to sun.\r\n\r\n    Deep in her eyes burn fires of purpose strong;\r\n      Her hand upholds the sceptre of God's truth;\r\n    Her lips send forth brave words against the wrong;\r\n      Glows in her heart the joy of deathless youth.\r\n\r\n    Kindly and gentle, learned too, and wise;\r\n      Lover of home and all the ties of kin;\r\n    Gay comrade of the laughing lips and eyes;\r\n      Give us new words to sing your praises in.\r\n\r\n    Yet let us rather now forget to praise,\r\n      Remembering only this true friend to greet,\r\n    As drawing near by straight and devious ways,\r\n      We lay our hearts--love's guerdon--at her feet.\r\n\r\n    Blow, O ye winds across the oceans, blow!\r\n      Go to the hills and prairies of the West!\r\n    Haste to the tropics, search the fields of snow,\r\n      Let the world's gift to her become your quest.\r\n\r\n    Shine, sun, through prism of the waterfall,\r\n      And build us here a rainbow arch to span\r\n    The years, and hold the citadel\r\n      Of her abiding work for God and man.\r\n\r\n    What is the gift, O winds, that ye have brought?\r\n      O, sun, what legend shines your arch above?\r\n    Ah, they are one, and all things else are naught,\r\n     Take them, beloved--they are love, love, love!\r\n\r\nMrs. Blatch spoke eloquently for her mother, saying in part:\r\n\r\n     I bring to you, Susan B. Anthony, the greetings of your friend\r\n     and co-worker, Elizabeth Cady Stanton, greetings full of gracious\r\n     memories. When the cause for which you have worked shall be\r\n     victorious, then as is the way of the world, will it be forgotten\r\n     that it ever meant effort or struggle for pioneers; but the\r\n     friendship of you two women will remain a precious memory in the\r\n     world's history, unforgotten and unforgettable. Your lives have\r\n     proved not only that women can work strenuously together without\r\n     jealousy, but that they can be friends in times of sunshine and\r\n     peace, of stress and storm. No mere fair-weather friends have you\r\n     been to each other.\r\n\r\n     Does not Emerson say that friendship is the slowest fruit in the\r\n     garden of God? The fruit of friendship between you two has grown\r\n     through half a hundred years, each year making it more beautiful,\r\n     more mellow, more sweet. But you have not been weak echoes of\r\n     each other; nay, often for the good of each you were thorns in\r\n     the side. Yet disagreement only quickened loyalty. Supplementing\r\n     each other, companionship drew out the best in each. You have\r\n     both been urged to untiring efforts through the sympathy, the\r\n     help of each other. You have attained the highest achievement in\r\n     demonstrating a lofty, an ideal friendship. This friendship of\r\n     you two women is the benediction for our century.\r\n\r\nThe last and tenderest tribute was offered by the Rev. Anna Howard\r\nShaw who said, in rich, musical accents and with a manner which seemed\r\nalmost to be inspired, what can only be most inadequately reported:\r\n\r\n     A little over a hundred years ago there came men who told us what\r\n     freedom is and what freemen may become. Later women with the same\r\n     love of it in their hearts said, \"There is no sex in freedom.\r\n     Whatever it makes possible for men it will make possible for\r\n     women.\" A few of these daring souls went forth to blaze the path.\r\n     Gradually the sunlight of freedom shone in their faces and they\r\n     encouraged others to follow. They went slowly for the way was\r\n     hard. They must make the path and it was a weary task. Sometimes\r\n     darkness settled over them and they must grope their way. Mott,\r\n     Stanton, Stone, Anthony--not one retraced her footsteps. The two\r\n     who are left still stand on the summit, great, glorious figures.\r\n     We ask, \"Is the way difficult?\" They answer, \"Yes, but the sun\r\n     shines on us and in the valley they know nothing of its glory.\r\n     Their cry we hear and are calling back to those who are still in\r\n     the valley.\"\r\n\r\n     Leader, comrade, friend, no name can express what you are to us.\r\n     You might have led us as commander, and we might have followed\r\n     and obeyed, but there still might have been wanting the divine\r\n     force of unchanging love. We look up to the sunlight where you\r\n     stand and say, \"We are coming.\" When we shall be fourscore we\r\n     shall still be calling to you, \"We are coming,\" for you will\r\n     still be beckoning us on as you climb still loftier heights.\r\n     Souls like yours can never rest in all the eternities of God.\r\n\r\nThen a hush fell on the people and all waited for Miss Anthony. During\r\nthe afternoon she had been sitting in a large armchair that was almost\r\ncovered by her cloak of royal purple velvet which she had thrown over\r\nit, the white satin lining forming a lovely background for her\r\nfinely-shaped head with its halo of silver hair. No one ever had seen\r\nher so moved as on this occasion when her memory must have carried her\r\nback to the days of bare halls, hostile audiences, ridicule, abuse,\r\nloneliness and ostracism by all but a very few staunch friends. \"Would\r\nshe be able to speak?\" many in the audience asked themselves, but the\r\nnearest friends waited calmly and without anxiety. They never had\r\nknown her to fail. The result was thus described:\r\n\r\n     For a moment after gaining her feet, Miss Anthony stood battling\r\n     with her emotions, but her indomitable courage conquered, and she\r\n     smiled at the audience as it rose to greet her. She wore a gown\r\n     of black duchesse satin with vest and revers of fine white lace\r\n     in which were a few modest pinks, while she carried a large\r\n     bouquet of violets. The moment she began talking the shadow\r\n     passed from her face and she stood erect, with head uplifted,\r\n     full of her old-time vigor.\r\n\r\n     \"How can you expect me to say a word?\" she said. \"And yet I must.\r\n     I have reason to feel grateful, for I have received letters and\r\n     telegrams from all over the world.[134] But the one that has\r\n     touched me the most is a simple note which came from an old home\r\n     of slavery, from a woman off of whose hands and feet the shackles\r\n     fell nearly forty years ago. That letter, my friends, contained\r\n     eighty cents--one penny for every year. It was all that this aged\r\n     person had....\r\n\r\n     I am grateful for the many expressions which I have listened to\r\n     this afternoon. I have heard the grandson of the great Frederick\r\n     Douglass speak to me through his violin. I mention this because I\r\n     remember so well Frederick Douglass when he rose at the\r\n     convention where the first resolution ever presented for woman\r\n     suffrage had his eloquence to help it....\r\n\r\n     Among the addresses from my younger co-workers, none has touched\r\n     me so deeply as that from the one of darker hue.... Nothing\r\n     speaks so strongly of freedom as the fact that the descendants of\r\n     those who went through that great agony--which, thank Heaven, has\r\n     passed away--have now full opportunities and can help to\r\n     celebrate my fifty years' work for liberty. I am glad of the\r\n     gains the half-century has brought to the women of Anglo-Saxon\r\n     birth. And I am glad above all else that the time is coming when\r\n     all women alike shall have the fullest rights of citizenship.\r\n\r\n     I thank you all. If I have had one regret this afternoon, it is\r\n     that some whom I have longed to have with me can not be here,\r\n     especially Mrs. Stanton. I want to impress the fact that my work\r\n     could have accomplished nothing if I had not been surrounded with\r\n     earnest and capable co-workers. Then, good friends, I have had a\r\n     home in which my father and mother, brothers and sisters, one and\r\n     all, stood at my back and helped me to success. I always have had\r\n     this co-operation and I have yet one sister left, who makes a\r\n     home for me and aids my work in every possible way....\r\n\r\n     I have shed no tears on arriving at a birthday ten years beyond\r\n     the age set for humanity. I have shed none over resigning the\r\n     presidency of the association. I am glad to give it up. I do it\r\n     cheerfully. And even so, when my time comes, I shall pass on\r\n     further, and accept my new place and vocation just as cheerfully\r\n     as I have touched this landmark.\r\n\r\n     I have passed as the leader of the association of which I have\r\n     been a member for so long, but I am not through working, for I\r\n     shall work to the end of my time, and when I am called home, if\r\n     there exist an immortal spirit, mine will still be with you,\r\n     watching and inspiring you.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony's words and manner thrilled every heart and left the\r\naudience in a state of exaltation.\r\n\r\nIn the evening, the Corcoran Art Gallery, one of the world's beautiful\r\nbuildings, was thrown open for the birthday reception. A colored\r\norchestra, under the leadership of Mr. Douglass, rendered a musical\r\nprogram. President Kauffman, of the Board of Trustees, presented the\r\nvisitors to the guest of honor, and the birthday committee assisted in\r\nreceiving. Although Miss Anthony had attended a business meeting in\r\nthe morning, and been the central figure in the celebration of the\r\nafternoon lasting until 6 o'clock, she was so alert, happy and\r\nvivacious during the entire evening as to challenge the admiration of\r\nall. There was no picture in all that famous collection more\r\nattractive than this white-haired woman, robed in garnet velvet,\r\nrelieved by antique fichu, collar and cuffs of old point lace. The\r\ncity press said:\r\n\r\n     For two hours, without a moment's intermission, Miss Anthony\r\n     clasped hands with those who were presented to her and listened\r\n     to congratulatory expressions. A number of local organizations of\r\n     women, and also the entire membership of the Washington College\r\n     of Law, for women, attended the reception in a body.\r\n\r\n     On the second floor hung her fine portrait which was presented to\r\n     the Corcoran Gallery of Art last night by Mrs. John B. Henderson,\r\n     wife of the former Senator from Missouri. The portrait is in oil\r\n     and represents Miss Anthony in full profile, attired in black\r\n     with lace at the throat, and about her shoulders the red shawl\r\n     which has come to be regarded as the emblem of her office as\r\n     president of the National Association.\r\n\r\n     During the two hours it seemed as if every one who greeted Miss\r\n     Anthony had met her at some time or at some place long ago.\r\n     Everybody wanted to stop and converse with her, and in the brief\r\n     minute they stood before her they plied her with countless\r\n     questions. In speaking of the event after she had returned to the\r\n     Riggs House, she said: \"Wasn't it wonderful? It seemed as if\r\n     every other person in that vast throng had met me before, or that\r\n     I had during my long life been a visitor at the home of some of\r\n     their relatives. It was grand. It was beautiful. It is good to be\r\n     loved by so many people. It is worth all the toil and the\r\n     heartaches.\"\r\n\r\nFrom a little band apparently leading a forlorn hope, almost\r\nuniversally ridiculed and condemned, Miss Anthony had increased her\r\nforces to a mighty host marching forward to an assured victory. From a\r\ncondition of social ostracism she had brought them to a position where\r\nthey commanded respect and admiration for their courageous advocacy of\r\na just cause. The small, curious, unsympathetic audiences of early\r\ndays had been transformed into this great gathering, which represented\r\nthe highest official life of the nation's capital and the intellectual\r\naristocracy of all the States in the Union. It was a wonderful change\r\nto have been effected in the lifetime of one woman, and all posterity\r\nwill rejoice that the leader of this greatest of progressive movements\r\nreceived the full measure of recognition from the people of her own\r\ntime and generation.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[131] From the founding of the National Association in 1869 the\r\npresidency was usually held by Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, while Miss\r\nSusan B Anthony was either vice president, corresponding secretary or\r\nchairman of the executive committee, although she sometimes filled the\r\npresidential chair. Mrs. Stanton continued as president until 1892,\r\nwhen she resigned at the age of seventy six. Miss Anthony was elected\r\nthat year and held the office until 1900, when she resigned at the age\r\nof eighty.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel Foster Avery served as corresponding secretary for twenty\r\none years, from 1880 to 1901. Her resignation was reluctantly accepted\r\nand a gift of $1,000 was presented to her, the contribution of friends\r\nin all parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe other officers since 1884 have been as follows: Vice presidents at\r\nlarge, Miss Anthony, Matilda Joslyn Gage, the Rev. Olympia Brown,\r\nPhoebe W. Couzins, Abigail Scott Duniway and, from 1892, the Rev. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw, treasurers, Jane H. Spofford from 1880 to 1892, and since\r\nthen Harriet Taylor Upton, recording secretaries, Ellen H. Sheldon,\r\nJulia T. Foster, Pearl Adams, Julia A. Wilbur, Caroline A. Sherman,\r\nSara Winthrop Smith, Hannah B. Sperry and, since 1890, Alice Stone\r\nBlackwell, auditors, Ruth C. Denison, Julia A. Wilbur, Eliza T. Ward,\r\nEllen M. O'Connor, the Rev. Frederick A. Hinckley, Harriet Taylor\r\nUpton, the Hon. Wm. Dudley Foulke, May Wright Sewall, Ellen Battelle\r\nDietrick, Josephine K. Henry, H. Augusta Howard, Annie L. Diggs, Sarah\r\nB. Cooper, Laura Clay, Catharine Waugh McCulloch. Mrs. Sewall was\r\nchairman of the executive committee from 1882 until she resigned in\r\n1890 and Lucy Stone was elected; in 1892 she begged to be relieved as\r\nshe was seventy four years old. The committee was then abolished, its\r\nduties being transferred to the business committee.\r\n\r\n[132] Miss Shaw referred to Miss Lucy E. Anthony, who for twelve years\r\nhad been her secretary and companion.\r\n\r\n[133] The most of the numerous gifts were presented during the\r\nconvention, as related earlier in the chapter.\r\n\r\n[134] Miss Anthony received on this occasion 1,100 letters and\r\ntelegrams, every one of which she acknowledged later with a personal\r\nmessage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXII.\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION.[135]\r\n\r\n\r\n_1884._--The American Woman Suffrage Association which was organized\r\nin Cleveland, Ohio, in November, 1869, held its sixteenth annual\r\nmeeting, November 19, 20, at Hershey Hall, Chicago. Lucy Stone in the\r\n_Woman's Journal_ said:\r\n\r\n     Beginning with a good-sized audience, it went on increasing in\r\n     numbers until the gallery, the stairs and the side aisles were\r\n     literally packed with people.\r\n\r\n     Reports of the work done by auxiliary and other societies came in\r\n     from Maine to Oregon and all the way between, showing in some\r\n     cases very little and in others a great deal of good work. But\r\n     each one was helpful in its measure to the final success, just as\r\n     streams of all sizes flow to make great rivers and the seas.\r\n     There were present some of the oldest workers--Dr. Mary F. Thomas\r\n     of Indiana and Mrs. Hannah M. Tracy Cutler of Illinois--who,\r\n     having put their hands to the plow in the beginning of the\r\n     movement, have never looked back. To supplement and continue the\r\n     work there were noble and earnest younger women, who came down\r\n     from Minnesota, Iowa, Wisconsin and Michigan and up from Ohio,\r\n     Missouri, Kansas, Indiana and Illinois, women who can speak well\r\n     for the cause and whose reports show that they know how to work\r\n     well for it, too. It was a joy and a comfort to meet them....\r\n\r\n     Not the least pleasant feature was the cordial friendliness that\r\n     seemed all-pervasive. Troops of women we had never seen came to\r\n     shake hands.... A bevy of bright girls stood below the platform\r\n     on the last evening and, looking up, they said: \"We are\r\n     school-girls now, but we are bound to help.\" The collections more\r\n     than paid the expenses, and two hundred memberships were taken.\r\n\r\nAll the local arrangements had been admirably made by a committee of\r\ninfluential Chicago women.[136] The city papers gave friendly reports,\r\nthose of the _Inter-Ocean_ being especially full.\r\n\r\nThe convention was not expected to open till Wednesday evening, but\r\nso large a number of delegates and friends met in the hall in the\r\nafternoon that an informal meeting was held in advance. Mrs. Cutler\r\ncalled the assembly to order, and the Rev. Florence Kollock offered\r\nprayer. A telegram was read from Chief-Justice Roger S. Greene, of\r\nWashington Territory, saying: \"Be assured that woman suffrage has\r\nworked well, done good, and been generally exercised by women at our\r\nState election.\"\r\n\r\nBrief addresses were made by Mrs. Lucy Stone, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore\r\nand Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton Harbert. Dr. Mary F. Thomas, in the name of\r\nthe Indiana W. S. A., the oldest State association in the country,\r\norganized in 1851, presented the association with a bouquet of never\r\nfading chrysanthemums.\r\n\r\nOn Wednesday evening Mrs. Helen Ekin Starrett gave the address of\r\nwelcome. In referring to the influence of the woman suffrage movement\r\nupon the legal status of women, she said that Kansas entered the Union\r\nas a State with women's personal and property rights legally\r\nrecognized as never before. This was largely because a delegate to the\r\nKansas constitutional convention which met in Leavenworth, (Mr. Sam\r\nWood), wrote to Lucy Stone at her home in Orange, N. J., asking her to\r\ndraft a legal form, which she did, with her baby on her knee, and its\r\nsuggestions were afterwards incorporated in the organic law of that\r\nState.[137] As one result of School Suffrage in the hands of women,\r\nKansas had the best schools in the United States while the people\r\nstill lived in cabins.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary B. Clay, of Kentucky, president of the association, made a\r\nspecial plea for work in the South, saying in part:\r\n\r\n     Alabama has given married women equal property rights with their\r\n     husbands. This monied equality I regard as one of the most\r\n     essential steps to our freedom, for as long as women are\r\n     dependent upon men for bread their whole moral nature is\r\n     necessarily warped. There never was a truer thought than that of\r\n     Alexander Hamilton, when he said, \"He who controls my means of\r\n     daily subsistence controls my whole moral being.\" I therefore\r\n     recommend to the Southern women particularly the petitioning for\r\n     property rights, because pecuniary independence is one of the\r\n     most potent weapons for freedom, and because that claim has less\r\n     prejudice to overcome....\r\n\r\n     Mississippi also has made equal property laws for women; and\r\n     Arkansas allows married women to hold their own property, and all\r\n     women to vote on the licensing of saloons within three miles of a\r\n     church or school-house. A lady writing from there says: \"The\r\n     welcome accorded the law by the women of the State refutes all\r\n     adverse theories, and establishes the fact that woman's nature\r\n     possesses an inherent strength and courage which no surroundings\r\n     can extinguish, and which only need the light of hope and the\r\n     voice of duty to call them into action.\" I would recommend that\r\n     whenever it is possible, we hold our conventions and send our\r\n     speakers through the South....\r\n\r\nHenry B. Blackwell said: \"This is not an anti-man society. Suffrage is\r\ndemanded as much for the sake of men as for the sake of women. What is\r\ngood for one is good for both;\" and Mrs. Livermore said, \"Women should\r\nhave a share in the government because the whole is better than the\r\nhalf.\"\r\n\r\nIn the annual report of Mrs. Lucy Stone, chairman of the executive\r\ncommittee, she said in part: \"During the past year, the chief effort\r\nof the society has been directed to aid the work in Oregon, where a\r\nconstitutional amendment had been submitted to the voters. One\r\nthousand dollars were raised for this purpose by our auxiliary\r\nsocieties, and forwarded to the Oregon Woman Suffrage Association.[138]\r\nThe society has also printed and circulated at cost more than 100,000\r\ntracts and leaflets.\"\r\n\r\nOfficers for the next year were elected, as follows: President,\r\nthe Hon. Wm. Dudley Foulke, State Senator of Indiana;\r\nvice-presidents-at-large, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore, the Hon. George\r\nWilliam Curtis, N. Y.; the Hon. George F. Hoar, Mass.; Mrs. Mary B.\r\nWillard, Mrs. H. M. T. Cutler, Ill.; Mrs. D. G. King, Neb.; Mrs. R. A.\r\nS. Janney, O.; Mrs. J. P. Fuller, Mrs. Rebecca N. Hazard, Mo.; Mrs.\r\nMartha A. Dorsett, Minn.; Mrs. Mary J. Coggeshall, Ia.; Mrs. Mary B.\r\nClay, Ky.; foreign corresponding secretary, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe;\r\ncorresponding secretary, Henry B. Blackwell; recording secretary, Mrs.\r\nMargaret W. Campbell; treasurer, Mrs. Abbie T. Codman; chairman\r\nexecutive committee, Mrs. Lucy Stone.[139]\r\n\r\nMr. Blackwell, chairman of the committee, reported resolutions which\r\nwere adopted with a few changes as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, In the words of Abraham Lincoln, That \"we go for all\r\n     sharing the privileges of the government who assist in bearing\r\n     its burdens, by no means excluding women;\" that a government of\r\n     the people, by the people, for the people, must be a government\r\n     of men and women, by men and women, for men and women; and that\r\n     any other form of government is unreasonable, unjust and\r\n     inconsistent with American principles.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we rejoice in the triumph of woman suffrage in\r\n     Washington Territory; in the continued success of woman suffrage\r\n     in Wyoming; in the exercise of School Suffrage by the women of\r\n     twelve States; in the establishment of Municipal Woman Suffrage\r\n     by Nova Scotia and Ontario, and in the steady growth of woman\r\n     suffrage during the past year as shown by more than 21,000\r\n     petitioners for it in Massachusetts, by increased activity in\r\n     Connecticut, New York, Ohio, Indiana, Illinois, Wisconsin,\r\n     Kansas, Nebraska, Kentucky, Minnesota and Oregon, by the recent\r\n     formation of an active State association in Vermont, and by the\r\n     presence with us to-day of sixty-six delegates from organized\r\n     societies in fifteen States.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the American Association is non-partisan; that\r\n     success will be promoted by refusing to connect woman suffrage\r\n     with any political party, or to take sides as suffragists in any\r\n     party conflict; but that we will question candidates of all\r\n     parties for State Legislatures, and use every honorable effort to\r\n     secure the election of suffragists as legislators irrespective of\r\n     party lines, provided they be men of integrity.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That this association expresses its appreciation of\r\n     the services rendered by the co-workers who since our last\r\n     meeting have been gathered with the honored dead: Mrs. Frances D.\r\n     Gage, who from the beginning of our movement until the last week\r\n     of her life never ceased to do what she could for its success;\r\n     Wendell Phillips, who as early as 1850 attended a woman's rights\r\n     convention at Worcester, Mass., and made an argument which\r\n     covered the whole ground of statement and defense, and with\r\n     serene faith advised: \"Take your part with the perfect and\r\n     abstract right and trust God to see that it shall prove the\r\n     expedient.\" Besides these we record the names of Kate Newell\r\n     Doggett, Laura Giddings Julian, Bishop Matthew Simpson, Mrs. L.\r\n     B. Barrett, Emily J. Leonard and Jane Gray Swisshelm.\r\n\r\nSpeaking to the memorial resolution Mrs. Cutler said: \"Some years ago\r\nI paid a visit to an old and valued friend who had long been an\r\ninvalid, though never so absorbed in her own suffering as to forget\r\nthe great needs of her human brothers and sisters. Said she, 'If you\r\noutlive me, I hope you will say for me that I tried honestly and\r\nearnestly to do my duty.' The promise then given I now attempt to\r\nfulfil in behalf of Mrs. Frances Dana Gage, our beloved 'Aunt Fanny,'\r\nwho entered upon her rest Nov. 10, 1884.\" Mrs. Cutler gave a full and\r\nappreciative review of Mrs. Gage's life. Dr. Mary F. Thomas spoke\r\nfeelingly of her, of Mrs. Julian and Mr. Phillips; and Mrs. Livermore\r\npaid a warm tribute to Mr. Phillips and Mrs. Doggett.\r\n\r\nThe plan of work adopted was in part as follows:\r\n\r\n     1. That the officers of this association memorialize Congress in\r\n     behalf of a sixteenth constitutional amendment prohibiting all\r\n     political distinctions on account of sex.\r\n\r\n     2. That while we do not undervalue any form of agitation, State\r\n     or national, we hold that practical woman suffrage can at present\r\n     be best promoted by urging legislative as well as constitutional\r\n     changes, and by appealing to State as well as national authority;\r\n     therefore we urge the establishment of active State societies,\r\n     with their working centers in the State capitals and their\r\n     corresponding committees in every representative district.\r\n\r\n     3. That in every State, at each session of its Legislature,\r\n     petitions should be presented by its own citizens asking for\r\n     woman suffrage by statute in all elections and for all officers\r\n     not expressly limited by the word \"male\" in the State\r\n     constitution.\r\n\r\n     4. That School Suffrage having been secured for women by statute\r\n     in twelve States, our next demand should be for Municipal\r\n     Suffrage by statute; also for Presidential Suffrage by statute,\r\n     under Article 2, Section 1, par. 2, of the United States\r\n     Constitution.\r\n\r\n     5. And, whereas, in three Territories, viz., Wyoming, Utah and\r\n     Washington, our cause is already won by statutes, therefore a\r\n     special effort should be made to secure similar statutory action\r\n     in the remaining Territories, viz.: Dakota, Montana, Idaho,\r\n     Arizona and New Mexico.\r\n\r\nAddresses were made by the Rev. S. S. Hunting, Mrs. Margaret W.\r\nCampbell of Iowa and Dr. Thomas. Mr. Foulke, Mrs. Mary E. Haggart of\r\nIndiana, Mrs. Livermore and Lucy Stone addressed the evening meeting,\r\nand the singing of the Doxology closed a memorable convention.\r\n\r\n_1885._--The Seventeenth annual meeting was held in Minneapolis,\r\nOctober 13-15, in the Church of the Redeemer (Universalist), the\r\nfinest in the city, which was given without charge. Here, as the daily\r\npapers said, \"the most brilliant audiences that ever assembled in\r\nMinneapolis\" gathered evening after evening until the last when crowds\r\nof people went away unable to find even standing room. The pulpit\r\nsteps were occupied, extra seats were brought in, the aisles were\r\ncrowded, and as far as one could see over the throng that filled the\r\ndoorway, was another assembly eager to hear what it could. The\r\nearnest, interested, assenting faces of the vast audience and their\r\nhearty applause attested their sympathy with the ideas and principles\r\nexpressed.\r\n\r\nEvery evening several of the speakers addressed large audiences in St.\r\nPaul, thus carrying on two series of meetings contemporaneously. The\r\nHon. Wm. Dudley Foulke occupied the chair. Mayor George A. Pillsbury,\r\nof Minneapolis, gave the address of welcome, which he closed by\r\nsaying: \"Our citizens may not all agree with you, yet we recognize the\r\nfact that some of the greatest and best minds in the country are\r\nengaged in this work. I have never identified myself with your\r\norganization but wish you Godspeed, and hope to see the time when the\r\nwomen shall stand with the men at the polls.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Julia Ward Howe in responding said: \"We are glad to be welcomed\r\nfor ourselves; we are still more gratified by the welcome extended to\r\nour cause. We do not live altogether in our magnificent cities and\r\nhouses; we all live in houses not made with hands. We have with us\r\nsome who have devoted their lives to this noble work. They have been\r\nbuilding up, stone by stone, a mighty structure, and it is to lay a\r\nfew more stones that we have gathered here.\"\r\n\r\nIt had been persistently asserted that Mrs. Howe and Louisa M. Alcott\r\nhad renounced their belief in equal suffrage. Mrs. Howe was present to\r\nspeak for herself. Miss Alcott wrote from Concord, Mass.:\r\n\r\n     I should think it was hardly necessary for me to say that it is\r\n     impossible for me ever to \"go back\" on woman suffrage. I\r\n     earnestly desire to go forward on that line as far and as fast as\r\n     the prejudices, selfishness and blindness of the world will let\r\n     us, and it is a great cross to me that ill-health and home duties\r\n     prevent my devoting heart, pen and time to this most vital\r\n     question of the age. After a fifty years' acquaintance with the\r\n     noble men and women of the anti-slavery cause and the sight of\r\n     the glorious end to their faithful work, I should be a traitor to\r\n     all I most love, honor and desire to imitate if I did not covet a\r\n     place among those who are giving their lives to the emancipation\r\n     of the white slaves of America.\r\n\r\n     If I can do no more, let my name stand among those who are\r\n     willing to bear ridicule and reproach for the truth's sake, and\r\n     so earn some right to rejoice when the victory is won.\r\n\r\n     Most heartily yours for woman suffrage and all other reforms.\r\n\r\nElizabeth Stuart Phelps wrote: \"With all my head and with all my heart\r\nI believe in womanhood suffrage; can I say more for your convention?\"\r\nand from the Rev. James Freeman Clarke, of Boston, \"Every word spoken\r\nfor or against our cause helps it forward. I feel that there is a\r\ncurrent of conviction sweeping us on toward the day when there shall\r\nbe neither male nor female, in Church or State, but equal rights for\r\nall, and the tools to those who can use them.\"\r\n\r\nChief-Justice Greene, of Washington Territory, sent a careful\r\nstatistical computation in regard to the women's votes, and said: \"My\r\nsober judgment, from the best light I have succeeded in getting, is\r\nthat at our last general election the women cast as full or a fuller\r\nvote than the men in proportion to their numbers.\" Mrs. Livermore\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     Whatever may be the apparent direction of the ripples on the\r\n     surface, facts which accumulate daily show us that the cause of\r\n     woman's enfranchisement progresses with a deep and steady\r\n     undercurrent. The long, weary, faithful work of the past,\r\n     covering almost half a century, has resulted in a radical change\r\n     of public opinion. It has opened to woman the doors of colleges,\r\n     universities and professional schools; it has increased her\r\n     opportunities for self-support till the United States census\r\n     enumerates nearly 300 employments in which women are working and\r\n     earning livelihoods; it has repealed many of the unjust laws\r\n     which discriminate against woman; it has given her partial\r\n     suffrage in twelve States and full suffrage in three Territories.\r\n\r\n     Courage, then, for the end draws near! A few more years of\r\n     persistent, faithful work and the women of the United States will\r\n     be recognized as the legal equals of men; for the goal towards\r\n     which we toil is the enfranchisement of women, since the ballot\r\n     is the only symbol of legal equality that is known in a republic.\r\n\r\nChancellor Wm. G. Eliot, of Washington University, St. Louis, wrote:\r\n\r\n     Considered as a _right_, suffrage belongs equally to man and\r\n     woman. They are equally citizens and taxpayers. They share\r\n     equally in the advantages of good government and suffer equally\r\n     from bad legislation. They equally need the right of\r\n     self-protection which the ballot alone can give. In average good,\r\n     practical sense, wherever fair opportunity is permitted women are\r\n     equal to men. In moral perception and practice women are at least\r\n     equal--generally the superiors, if such comparison must be made.\r\n     There is, therefore, no justification in saying that the right of\r\n     suffrage, on whatever founded, belongs to man rather than to\r\n     woman.\r\n\r\n     Considered as a _privilege_, little needs to be said on either\r\n     side.... Every citizen is under moral obligation to take part in\r\n     the social interests and welfare of the community, whether\r\n     national or municipal. Woman equally with man is under that moral\r\n     law. In a republic she can not rightly be deprived of the\r\n     opportunity to do her full share as a citizen in all that\r\n     concerns good government.\r\n\r\n     This seems to be the whole story. I have read with astonishment\r\n     the arguments (so called) of Francis Parkman, the Rev. Brooke\r\n     Herford and Mrs. Kate Gannett Wells. They scarcely touch the real\r\n     merits of the case.\r\n\r\nDr. Mary F. Thomas, of Indiana, wrote:\r\n\r\n     As I see pictured before me all of you gathered from different\r\n     parts of this great sisterhood of States to discuss the grand\r\n     principle of human freedom, I can but compare this assembly with\r\n     one convened in Philadelphia over a hundred years ago with this\r\n     difference--they declared for the civil and political freedom of\r\n     all men; you ask to-day that all human beings of sound mind shall\r\n     enjoy the civil and political rights which they are entitled to\r\n     by virtue of their humanity. As the judicious management of the\r\n     family circle requires the combined wisdom and judgment of father\r\n     and mother, so this great political family, whose interests are\r\n     identical, can only be consistently managed by the complete\r\n     representation and concurrence of each individual governed by its\r\n     laws.\r\n\r\n     It is not necessary for me to show argument for this statement,\r\n     as your meeting to-day, composed of men and women thoroughly\r\n     imbued with the spirit of the great truth contained in the\r\n     Declaration of Independence, will supply words glowing with\r\n     fervor that can not be written, that comes with a full conviction\r\n     of the magnitude of this great question, involving even the\r\n     perpetuity of our government.... But without other reasons than\r\n     that it is right, let the united voice of your meeting demand\r\n     full recognition of the political rights of the women of the\r\n     nation, so that it may stand before the world exemplifying the\r\n     meaning of a true republic. After near half a century of earnest,\r\n     continued pleading we see light breaking in different parts of\r\n     the political horizon. If it takes half a century more, nay, even\r\n     longer than that, to establish this truth let us never falter.\r\n     For we know our cause is just and, as God is just, the eternal\r\n     principles of right must succeed.\r\n\r\nAmong the speakers were Mr. Foulke, Mr. Blackwell, Mrs. Alice Pickler\r\nof Dakota, Mrs. Cutler, Miss Bessie Isaacs of Washington Territory,\r\nthe Rev. Ada C. Bowles of Massachusetts, Mrs. Abigail Scott Duniway,\r\neditor of the _New Northwest_, Oregon, and from Minneapolis Mrs. Sarah\r\nBurger Stearns, C. H. Du Bois, editor of the _Spectator_, Dr. Martha\r\nG. Ripley, the Rev. Dr. J. H. Tuttle, pastor of the Church of the\r\nRedeemer, the Rev. Kristofer Jansen, of the Swedish Unitarian Church,\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Williams of the City Mission, the Rev. Mr. Tabor of the\r\nFriends' Church, the Rev. Mr. Harrington, a visiting Universalist\r\nminister, and Mrs. Charlotte O. Van Cleve, of the Bethany Home, who\r\nspoke of herself and her associates as \"the ambulance corps, to pick\r\nup and care for the fallen and wounded of their sex.\"\r\n\r\nJudge Norton H. Hemiup of Minneapolis, read a humorous play in several\r\nacts, dramatically representing the venerable widows of ex-presidents\r\nand wives of living ones going to the polls in their respective\r\nprecincts and offering their votes in vain, while those of the late\r\nslaves and of men half-drunk and wholly ignorant were received without\r\na question.\r\n\r\nMajor J. A. Pickler, the chivalrous legislator of Dakota, who\r\nchampioned the suffrage bill which passed both Houses and was defeated\r\nby the veto of Gov. Gilbert F. Pierce, was invited to tell the history\r\nof the bill and did so in a vigorous speech. He said its passage was\r\nmaterially aided by the efforts of Eastern remonstrants to defeat it,\r\nand added: \"There are peculiar reasons why our women should have their\r\nrights, as they own fully one-fourth of the land and are veritable\r\nheroines.\" During the convention the men and women present from Dakota\r\norganized an association to carry on the battle for equal rights in\r\nthat Territory.\r\n\r\nMrs. Howe said in her address:\r\n\r\n     While a great deal needs to be said to both men and women on the\r\n     subject of woman suffrage, I am one who thinks that most needs\r\n     to be said to women. This is quite natural both because of their\r\n     timidity in putting themselves forward and because of their\r\n     frequent ignorance of the principles upon which reform is based.\r\n     No one could be more opposed to woman suffrage than I was twenty\r\n     years ago. Everything I had read and heard seemed to point in\r\n     exactly the opposite direction. But at the first meeting I\r\n     attended I heard Lucy Stone, Henry B. Blackwell, Elizabeth Cady\r\n     Stanton and other pioneers of the cause, found nothing but\r\n     reasonableness in their speech and their arguments and so was\r\n     speedily converted.\r\n\r\nThe Battle Hymn of the Republic was then sung by Prof. James G. Clark,\r\nthe well-known singer of anti-slavery days, the audience rising and\r\njoining in the chorus.\r\n\r\nMrs. Margaret W. Campbell of Iowa, who was introduced by Lucy Stone\r\nwith a history of her many years of devoted work for the cause, said\r\nin part: \"Good men who mean well often say that women are as fit to\r\nvote as the ignorant foreigners just landed at Castle Garden or the\r\nfreedmen who can not read or write. Don't say that any more; you don't\r\nknow how it hurts. Say instead, 'You are as fit to vote as we are.'\r\nThe names of those who emancipated the slave will be written in\r\nletters of gold, but the names of those who have helped to emancipate\r\nthe women of this nation will be written in letters of living light.\"\r\n\r\nThe closing address was made by Mrs. Stone. \"Her feeling and womanly\r\nappeals,\" said the Minneapolis papers, \"were such as to move any\r\nmasculine heart not thoroughly indurated.\" She said in part:\r\n\r\n     If the question of the right of women to a voice in making the\r\n     laws they are to obey could be treated in the same common-sense\r\n     way that other practical questions are treated it would have been\r\n     settled long ago. If the question were to be asked in any\r\n     community about to establish a government, \"Shall the whole\r\n     people who are of mature age and sound mind have a right to help\r\n     make the laws they are required to obey?\" the natural answer\r\n     would be that they should have that right. But the fact is that\r\n     only the men exercise it. If the question were asked, \"Shall the\r\n     whole people who are of mature age and sound mind and not\r\n     convicted of crime have a right to elect the men who will have\r\n     the spending of the money they pay for taxes?\" the common-sense\r\n     answer would be that they should have that right. But the fact is\r\n     that only men are allowed to exercise it. So of the special\r\n     interests of women, their right to settle the laws which regulate\r\n     their relation to their children, their right to earn and own, to\r\n     buy and sell, to will and deed, the application of the simple\r\n     principles of fair play, would have given women equal voice with\r\n     men in these questions of personal and common interest. But as\r\n     it is men control it all, whether it is the child we bear, the\r\n     dollar we earn or the will we wish to make.\r\n\r\n     One would suppose that under a government whose fundamental\r\n     principle affirms that \"the consent of the governed\" is the just\r\n     basis, the consent of the governed women would have been asked\r\n     for. The only form of consent is a vote and that is denied to\r\n     women. As a result they are at a disadvantage everywhere. The\r\n     stigma of disfranchisement cheapens the respect due to their\r\n     opinions, diminishes their earnings and makes them subjects in\r\n     the home as they are in the State. The woman suffrage movement\r\n     means equal rights for women. It proposes to secure fair play and\r\n     justice.\r\n\r\nAt this convention valuable reports were presented from twenty-six\r\nStates. Of especial interest was that from Texas, where Mrs. Mariana\r\nT. Folsom had done seven months' work under the auspices of the\r\nAmerican W. S. A., giving nearly 200 public addresses in advocacy of\r\nequal rights. Texas was virgin soil on this subject, and Mrs. Folsom's\r\ndescription of the conditions she found there was both entertaining\r\nand instructive.\r\n\r\nThe old officers were re-elected with but few changes. Among the\r\nresolutions adopted were the following:\r\n\r\n     The American Woman Suffrage Association, at its seventeenth\r\n     annual meeting, in this beautiful city of the new Northwest,\r\n     reaffirms the American principle of free representative\r\n     government, and demands its application to women. \"Governments\r\n     derive their just powers from the consent of the governed,\" and\r\n     women are governed; \"taxation without representation is tyranny,\"\r\n     and women are taxed; \"all political power inheres in the people,\"\r\n     and one-half of the people are women.\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That women, as sisters, wives and mothers of men,\r\n     have special rights to protect and special wrongs to remedy; that\r\n     their votes will represent in a special sense the interests of\r\n     the home; that equal co-operation of the sexes is essential alike\r\n     to a happy home, a refined society, a Christian church and a\r\n     republican State.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Under the Federal Constitution, \"All persons born or\r\n     naturalized in the United States are citizens thereof, and of the\r\n     States in which they reside;\" and, by the decision of the United\r\n     States courts, \"Women are citizens, and may be made voters by\r\n     appropriate State legislation;\" therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That this association regards with satisfaction the\r\n     acceptance of the claim of Anna Ella Carroll by the United States\r\n     Court of Claims, by which the remarkable services of Miss Carroll\r\n     in urging the campaign of Tennessee, which broke the force of the\r\n     rebellion and gave success to our armies, will have at last,\r\n     after more than a score of years, their late reward.[140]\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the association send a deputation to Washington\r\n     in behalf of its memorial to Congress to frame a statute\r\n     prohibiting the disfranchisement of women in the Territories, and\r\n     to co-operate with the National Woman Suffrage Association (at\r\n     its January meeting) for a Sixteenth Amendment forbidding\r\n     political distinctions on account of sex.\r\n\r\nThe great success of this convention was due in large measure to the\r\nexcellent arrangements made by the friends in Minneapolis, especially\r\nDr. Ripley and Mrs. Martha A. Dorsett.\r\n\r\nThe association sent two delegates, Henry B. Blackwell and the Rev.\r\nAnna H. Shaw, to Washington, to urge upon the House Committee the duty\r\nof Congress to establish equal suffrage in the Territories. They were\r\ngiven a respectful hearing.\r\n\r\n_1886._--The Eighteenth annual meeting was held in Topeka, Kan.,\r\nOctober 26-28. The morning and afternoon sessions were held in Music\r\nHall. Above the platform hung the beautiful banner of the Minnesota W.\r\nS. A., sent by Dr. Martha G. Ripley, and at its side was a package of\r\n7,000 leaflets for distribution contributed by Mrs. Cornelia C. Hussey\r\nof New Jersey, which were gladly taken for use in different States.\r\nThe evening meetings assembled in the Hall of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, seating 1,200 persons; the floor and both galleries\r\nwere crowded with the best citizens of Topeka; all the desks were\r\ntaken out, making room for more chairs, and even then hundreds of\r\npeople were turned away. Both halls were given free.\r\n\r\nAll the preparations had been admirably made by Mrs. Juliet N. Martin,\r\nMiss Olive P. Bray, Mrs. S. A. Thurston and other Topeka women, who\r\nhad a collation spread in Music Hall for the delegates on their\r\narrival. The press gave full and cordial reports. Lucy Stone wrote in\r\nthe _Woman's Journal_:\r\n\r\n     We found the editors of the four daily papers all suffragists.\r\n     Among these was Major J. K. Hudson, who took his first lessons in\r\n     equal rights on the _Anti-Slavery Bugle_ in Ohio and, reared\r\n     among \"Friends,\" was ready to continue the good service he has\r\n     all along rendered. Here, too, we found our old co-worker,\r\n     William P. Tomlinson, who at one time published the _Anti-Slavery\r\n     Standard_ for Wendell Phillips and the American Anti-Slavery\r\n     Society, and who a little later, in his young prime, devoted his\r\n     time, his money and his strength to the publication of the\r\n     _Woman's Advocate_ in New York, of which he was proprietor and\r\n     editor. He is now editor of the Topeka _Daily Democrat_. Mr. B.\r\n     P. Baker, now editor and proprietor of the _Commonwealth_, did\r\n     good service to the woman suffrage cause in 1867 in the Topeka\r\n     _Record_. Mr. McLennan, of the _Journal_, is also with us.\r\n\r\nThe whole convention was interspersed with ringing reminiscences of\r\nthe heroic early history of Kansas. Mrs. S. N. Wood, who in the Border\r\nRuffian days went through the enemy's lines and at great personal\r\nperil brought into beleaguered Lawrence the ammunition which enabled\r\nit to defend itself, came to the platform to add her good word for\r\nequal suffrage. It was a great pleasure to the officers of the\r\nassociation to meet her and the other early Kansas workers, many of\r\nwhom, like Mrs. J. H. Slocum, of Emporia, were old personal friends.\r\n\r\nMrs. Anna C. Wait, president of the Kansas W. S. A. and editor of the\r\nLincoln _Beacon_, gave the address of welcome in behalf of the\r\nsuffragists. Referring to the first campaign for a woman suffrage\r\namendment in 1867, when Lucy Stone and Henry B. Blackwell spoke in\r\nforty-two counties of Kansas, Mrs. Wait said: \"Nineteen years ago when\r\nyou came to Kansas you found no suffrage societies and even seven\r\nyears ago you would have found none. To-day, in behalf of the State W.\r\nS. A. and its many flourishing auxiliaries, I welcome these dear\r\nfriends who come to us from the rock-ribbed shores of the Atlantic,\r\nfrom the coast of the Pacific, from the lakes of the North and from\r\nthe sunny South, a veritable gathering of the clans of freedom.\"\r\n\r\nMajor Hudson, in his address of welcome in behalf of the city,\r\nreviewed the history of woman suffrage in Kansas, paid a tribute to\r\nthe work of the pioneer suffragists, and said:\r\n\r\n     We welcome you to Kansas, because it has been good battle-ground\r\n     for the right.... We place the ballot in the hands of the\r\n     foreigner who can not read or speak our language, and who knows\r\n     nothing of our government; we enfranchised a slave race, most of\r\n     whom can not read; and yet we deny to the women of America the\r\n     ballot, which in their hands would be the strongest protection of\r\n     this republic against the ignorance and vice of the great centers\r\n     of our population. Give to woman the ballot, and you give her\r\n     equal pay with men for the same work; you break down prejudice\r\n     and open to her every vocation in which she is competent to\r\n     engage; you do more--you give her an individuality, and equal\r\n     right in life.\r\n\r\nThe president, the Hon. William Dudley Foulke, in his response to the\r\nwelcome of the suffrage association said: \"It gives us great pleasure\r\nto visit your beautiful city and fertile State. It gives us pleasure\r\nnot because your State is fertile and your city beautiful but because\r\nit is in these Western States that there is most hope of the growth of\r\nthe woman suffrage movement. The older States are what old age is in\r\nthe human frame, something that is difficult to change; but where\r\nthere is young blood there is hope and the progress of a new idea is\r\nmore rapid.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Howe, responding to the welcome of the citizens, said some one\r\nhad spoken of woman suffrage as a hobby; she questioned whether the\r\nopposition to suffrage was not the hobby and suffrage the horse. The\r\ndiscussion of these great questions was doing much to make the women\r\nof the country one in feeling, and to do away with sectional\r\nprejudices. A most cordial hearing was given to the Woman's Congress\r\nlately held at Louisville, Ky., and especially to the woman suffrage\r\nsymposium which occupied one evening. Mrs. Howe spoke of the\r\nwonderful, providential history of Kansas, and the way in which a new\r\nand unexpected chapter of the country's history opened out from the\r\nexperience of the young Territory. She remembered when the name of\r\nKansas was the word which set men's blood at the East tingling. She\r\ncontinued:\r\n\r\n     You men of Kansas, you who have been bought with a price, noble\r\n     men have worked and suffered and died that you might be free. For\r\n     you Charles Sumner fell in the Senate of the United States. He\r\n     fell to rise again, but others fell for whom there was no rising.\r\n     Having received this great gift of freedom, pray you go on to\r\n     make it perfect. You may think that you have a free State, well\r\n     founded and stable, and that it will stand; but remember that the\r\n     State, like the Church, is not a structure to be built and set up\r\n     but a living organism to grow and move. Its life is progress and\r\n     freedom. Do not think that you can stay this great tide of\r\n     progress by saying, \"Thus far shalt thou go and no farther.\" No\r\n     such limitation is possible. That tide will oversweep every\r\n     obstacle set in its way.\r\n\r\n     Why, men of Kansas, having been so nobly endowed at the\r\n     beginning, have you let the younger children in the nursery of\r\n     our dear mother country learn lessons that you have not learned?\r\n     Are the women of Wyoming and Washington better than your women,\r\n     and do the men of those Territories love their women better than\r\n     you love yours? You will say \"no,\" with indignation; but remember\r\n     that love is shown in deeds far more than in words. Until you\r\n     make your women free I must hold that you do not love them as\r\n     well as those do who have given their mothers and sisters the\r\n     gift of political enfranchisement. This place is the temple of\r\n     your liberties; here, if anywhere, should be spoken the words of\r\n     wisdom and be enacted just and equal laws. However grand the\r\n     words may be which have been spoken here, may they become grander\r\n     and better and deeper, until to all your other glories shall be\r\n     added that of having set the crown of freedom upon the heads of\r\n     the women of your State!\r\n\r\nOnly a few gleanings from the many speeches can be given. Professor W.\r\nH. Carruth, of the Kansas State University, said in part:\r\n\r\n     We are likely to meet some good-natured person who will say:\r\n     \"Why, yes, I am in favor of woman suffrage, but I don't see that\r\n     there is any need of it here in Kansas. If I were in Rhode Island\r\n     or Connecticut, where there are so many laws unjust to women, I\r\n     would petition and work for it; but I don't see that it is worth\r\n     while to make a fuss about it here.\" Now, what can be said to\r\n     such a person? Weapons are both defensive and aggressive. The\r\n     ballot has both uses. What would a herdsman say if you told him\r\n     his sheepfold was all that was needed, and refused to give him a\r\n     gun? What would the farmer say if you gave him a cultivator but\r\n     no plough? What would Christianity be if it had only the Ten\r\n     Commandments and not the Golden Rule?\r\n\r\n     He who thinks the ballot is given simply as a means of\r\n     protection--protection in a limited sense, against fraud and\r\n     violence--has but a limited conception of the duties of American\r\n     citizenship. The old let-alone theory of government has been\r\n     found a failure, and instead of it people are coming to think\r\n     that government is good to do anything that it can do best--just\r\n     as they have already learned that it is proper for woman to do\r\n     anything that she can do well. In a word, as Mrs. Howe said the\r\n     other evening, the ballot is a means of getting things done which\r\n     we want done.\r\n\r\n     When your good friend with a kind and prosperous husband, a\r\n     pleasant home and nothing lacking which better laws could secure\r\n     for her, says she thinks women are already pretty well treated\r\n     and she doesn't know that she would care for the ballot, ask her\r\n     how she would feel if she were a teacher and were expected to\r\n     work beside a man, equal work and equal time, he to get $60 and\r\n     she $40 a month? Ask her whether she would not want to have a\r\n     vote then? Isn't this a case, kind mistress of a home, where you\r\n     should remember those in bonds as bound with them? I very much\r\n     fear there never will be a time when all the good people in this\r\n     world can dispense with any effective weapon against wrong.\r\n\r\n     And, beyond this, there are all the offensive, aggressive uses of\r\n     the ballot. We want a sewer here, a bridge there, a lamp-post or\r\n     a hydrant yonder. A woman's nose will scent a defective drain\r\n     where ten men pass it by, but votes get these things looked\r\n     after. We want a new schoolhouse, or more brains or more fresh\r\n     air in an old one. Don't you know that women will attend to such\r\n     needs sooner than men?\r\n\r\nMr. Foulke said in part:\r\n\r\n     It is said that woman suffragists are dreamers. There was a time\r\n     within our memory when human flesh in this our free America was\r\n     sold at auction. In those days a few earnest men dreamed of a\r\n     time when our flag should no longer unfurl itself over a slave.\r\n     Inspired by this great vision they bore the persecution and\r\n     contumely of their fellows. In season and out of season they\r\n     preached their glorious gospel of immediate and unconditional\r\n     emancipation. Wild visionaries they, incendiaries whose very\r\n     writings, like the heresies of old, must be consigned to the\r\n     flames; impracticable enthusiasts, seditious citizens. But lo!\r\n     the flame of war passed over us and their dream is true; and in\r\n     the clearer light which shines upon us to-day, we can hardly\r\n     realize that this great blot upon our civilization could have\r\n     existed, the time seems so far away.\r\n\r\n     And we of America, we who have reached the summit of the\r\n     prophecies of centuries past, we dream of new and loftier\r\n     mountains in the distance. We who have realized in our political\r\n     institutions a universal equality of men before the law, find\r\n     that we have only reached the foothills of the greater range\r\n     beyond. There are men in our midst who are dreaming to-day of a\r\n     time when mere political equality shall be based upon that\r\n     broader social and economic equality which is so necessary to\r\n     maintain it. They dream of a time when each man's reward shall be\r\n     proportioned to his own exertions and his own desert, and nothing\r\n     at all shall be due to the accident of birth; dream of a time\r\n     when bitter, grinding poverty, save as a punishment for idleness,\r\n     shall no longer exist in a world so full of the bounty of heaven.\r\n     Is it wilder than the dream of him who, under the despotism of\r\n     the Bourbons, could dream of a great people whose birth should be\r\n     heralded by the cry that all men are created equal? Is it wilder\r\n     than the dream of him who, oppressed by the tyranny of Alva,\r\n     could dream of a day of perfect religious toleration? Men talk\r\n     with contemptuous pity of the dreamer. But he rather is the\r\n     object of pity who bars the windows and draws the curtains of his\r\n     soul to shut out the light of heaven that would smile in upon\r\n     him. Let us rather pity the man who fears to utter the divine\r\n     thought which fills him. Let us pity rather that man or that\r\n     nation which lives in the complacent consciousness of its own\r\n     virtue and blessedness, and dreams of no higher good than it\r\n     possesses. He that has a dream of something better than he sees\r\n     around him, let him tell it though the world smile. He that has a\r\n     prophecy to utter, let him speak, though men account it his folly\r\n     as much as they will. God bless the dreamers of all just and\r\n     perfect dreams! The great wheel of the ages with ever-increasing\r\n     motion is sure to roll out their accomplishment.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Louis A. Banks, lately of Washington Territory, spoke of\r\nwoman suffrage there. He said:\r\n\r\n     The first fact proved by experience is that women do vote. Before\r\n     the law was enacted, the old objection used to meet us on every\r\n     hand, \"The women do not want to vote\"--as though that, if true,\r\n     were a valid reason. They ought to want to. It is my business to\r\n     urge men to repent, and I have never supposed it a reason to\r\n     cease preaching to them because they did not want to repent; they\r\n     ought to want to. But our experience has proved that women do\r\n     want to vote. It was universally conceded that in our first\r\n     general Territorial election fully as many women voted in\r\n     proportion to their numbers as men....\r\n\r\n     Woman's influence as a citizen has been of equal value in the\r\n     jury-box. Experience shows that she is peculiarly fitted for that\r\n     duty. Woe to the gambler who enriches himself by the folly or\r\n     innocence of the ignorant, and the rum-seller who lures boys into\r\n     his backroom! Woe to the human vultures who prey upon young\r\n     lives, when they fall into the hands of a jury of mothers!...\r\n\r\n     You who have not hitherto been woman suffragists, why not espouse\r\n     this cause now, when it is in the full flush of its heroic\r\n     struggle? When John Adams went courting Abigail Smith, her proud\r\n     father said to her: \"Who is this young Adams? Where did he come\r\n     from?\" Abigail answered: \"I do not know where he came from and I\r\n     do not care, but I know where he is going and I am going with\r\n     him.\" Ladies and gentlemen, you know where we are going; we\r\n     invite your company for the journey.\r\n\r\nState Senator R. W. Blue said: \"One of the greatest questions of the\r\nday is how to counteract the influence of the vicious vote cast every\r\nyear in the large cities. I believe the only way to do that is to\r\nenfranchise the women.\" He added that he had worked for the Municipal\r\nSuffrage Bill in the preceding Legislature, and should do so in the\r\nnext. President Foulke complimented him on his bold and outspoken\r\nremarks, and said he thought a man in politics never lost anything by\r\ntelling the people exactly where he stood on vital issues.[141]\r\n\r\nJames G. Clark, associate editor of the Minneapolis _Spectator_, was a\r\ndelegate, and delighted the audience with his equal rights songs. A\r\nletter was received from Dr. Mary F. Thomas and, by a rising vote of\r\nthe convention, it was decided to send her a telegram of greeting and\r\ncongratulations on her seventieth birthday.\r\n\r\nLetters were read from Chief-Justice Greene of Washington Territory,\r\nand from Mrs. Margaret Bright Lucas of England, sister of John and\r\nJacob Bright; also telegrams from the Minnesota W. S. A., from Major\r\nand Mrs. Pickler of South Dakota, and from others, and reports from\r\nthe different State societies.\r\n\r\nChancellor J. A. Lippincott, of the State University, invited the\r\nassociation to visit that institution, and Mrs. Howe and Mrs. Stone to\r\naddress the students. Mrs. Stone wrote in the _Woman's Journal_: \"It\r\nwas worth the journey to receive the warm welcome which greeted us on\r\nevery hand, and still more to see the progress the cause has made in\r\nthe nineteen years that have passed since the first suffrage campaign\r\nin Kansas. It would not be surprising if Municipal Suffrage should be\r\nsecured in this State at the next session of the Legislature.[142] The\r\nvery air was full of suffrage, even in the midst of the political\r\ncontest.\"\r\n\r\n_1887._--The Nineteenth annual meeting was held in Association Hall,\r\nPhiladelphia, October 31, November 1, 2. The platform had been\r\nbeautifully decorated with tropical plants and foliage by Miss\r\nElizabeth B. Justice and other Pennsylvania friends. The weather was\r\nfine, the audience sympathetic and the speaking excellent.\r\n\r\nState Senator A. D. Harlan gave the address of welcome in behalf of\r\nthe Pennsylvania W. S. A. President Wm. Dudley Foulke in responding\r\npaid a tribute to the Senator's good service in the Legislature in\r\nbehalf of a constitutional amendment for equal suffrage. A letter of\r\nwelcome was read from the venerable and beloved president of the\r\nassociation, Miss Mary Grew, who was kept away by illness. Col. T. W.\r\nHigginson said:\r\n\r\n     I have the sensations of a Revolutionary veteran, almost, in\r\n     coming back to Philadelphia and remembering our early suffrage\r\n     meetings here in that time of storm, in contrasting the audiences\r\n     of to-day with the audiences of that day, and in thinking what\r\n     are the difficulties that come before us now as compared with\r\n     those of our youth. The audiences have changed, the atmosphere of\r\n     the community has changed; nothing but the cause remains the\r\n     same, and that remains because it is a part of the necessary\r\n     evolution of democratic society and is an immortal thing.\r\n\r\n     I recall those early audiences; the rows of quiet faces in Quaker\r\n     bonnets in the foreground; the rows of exceedingly unquiet\r\n     figures of Southern medical students, with their hats on, in the\r\n     background. I recall the visible purpose of those energetic young\r\n     gentlemen to hear nobody but the women, and the calm\r\n     determination with which their bootheels contributed to put the\r\n     male speakers down. I recall also their too-assiduous attentions\r\n     in the streets outside when the meeting broke up....\r\n\r\n     Woman suffrage should be urged, in my opinion, not from any\r\n     predictions of what women will do with their votes after they get\r\n     them, but on the ground that by all the traditions of our\r\n     government, by all the precepts of its early founders, by all the\r\n     axioms which lie at the foundation of our political principles,\r\n     woman needs the ballot for self-respect and self-protection.\r\n\r\n     The woman of old times who did not read books of political\r\n     economy or attend public meetings, could retain her self-respect;\r\n     but the woman of modern times, with every step she takes in the\r\n     higher education, finds it harder to retain that self-respect\r\n     while she is in a republican government and yet not a member of\r\n     it. She can study all the books that I saw collected this morning\r\n     in the political economy alcove of the Bryn Mawr College; she can\r\n     master them all; she can know more about them perhaps than any\r\n     man of her acquaintance; and yet to put one thing she has learned\r\n     there in practice by the simple process of dropping a piece of\r\n     paper into a ballot-box--she can no more do that than she could\r\n     put out her slender finger and stop the planet in its course.\r\n     That is what I mean by woman's needing the suffrage for\r\n     self-respect.\r\n\r\n     Then as to self-protection. We know there have been great\r\n     improvements in the laws in regard to women. What brought about\r\n     those improvements? The steady labor of women like these on this\r\n     platform, going before Legislatures year by year and asking for\r\n     something they were not willing to give, the ballot; but, as a\r\n     result of it, to keep the poor creatures quiet, some law was\r\n     passed removing a restriction. The old English writer Pepys,\r\n     according to his diary, after spending a good deal of money for\r\n     himself finds a little left and buys his wife a new gown,\r\n     because, he says, \"It is fit that the poor wretch should have\r\n     something to content her.\" I have seen many laws passed for the\r\n     advantage of women and they were generally passed on that\r\n     principle.\r\n\r\n     I remember going before the Rhode Island Legislature once with\r\n     Lucy Stone and she unrolled with her peculiar persuasive power\r\n     the wrong laws which existed in that commonwealth in regard to\r\n     women. After the hearing was over the chairman of that committee,\r\n     a judge who had served on it for years, said to her: \"Mrs. Stone,\r\n     all that you have stated this morning is true, and I am ashamed\r\n     to think that I, who have been chairman for years of this\r\n     judiciary committee, should have known in my secret heart that it\r\n     was all true and should have done nothing to set these wrongs\r\n     right until I was reminded of them by a woman.\" Again and again I\r\n     have seen that experience. Women with bleeding feet, women with\r\n     exhausted voices, women with wornout lives, have lavished their\r\n     strength to secure ordinary justice in the form of laws which a\r\n     single woman inside the State House, armed with the position of\r\n     member of the Legislature and representing a sex who had votes,\r\n     could have had righted within two years. Every man knows the\r\n     weakness of a disfranchised class of men. The whole race of women\r\n     is disfranchised, and they suffer in the same way.\r\n\r\nAmong the other speakers were the Rev. Charles G. Ames, Henry B.\r\nBlackwell, the Rev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell, Dr. Thomas, Mrs.\r\nCampbell, Mrs. Mary E. Haggart, Mrs. Frances E. W. Harper, the Rev. S.\r\nS. Hunting, Miss Cora Scott Pond, the Rev. Ada C. Bowles and Mrs.\r\nAdelaide A. Claflin.\r\n\r\nThe chairman of the executive committee, Mrs. Lucy Stone, in her\r\nannual report, reviewed the year's activities and continued:\r\n\r\n     But the chief work of the American Woman Suffrage Association\r\n     during the past year has been to obtain wide access to the public\r\n     through the newspapers. Early in the year correspondence was\r\n     opened with most of the papers in the United States. The editors\r\n     were asked whether they would publish suffrage literature if it\r\n     were sent them every week without charge. More than a thousand\r\n     answered that they would use what we sent, in whole or in part.\r\n     Accepting this the association has, for the last eight months,\r\n     furnished 1,000 weekly papers with a suffrage column. The cost of\r\n     it consumes nearly the whole interest of the Eddy Fund, besides\r\n     much time and strength gratuitously given. But as these papers\r\n     come to us week by week containing the suffrage items and\r\n     articles which through their columns reach millions of readers,\r\n     we feel that no better use could be made of money or time.\r\n\r\nThe Revs. Anna H. Shaw and Ada C. Bowles were chosen national\r\nlecturers. Among the resolutions were the following:\r\n\r\n     We congratulate the Legislature of Kansas upon its honorable\r\n     record in extending Municipal Suffrage last February to the women\r\n     of that State, and the 26,000 women of Kansas by whose aid, last\r\n     April, reformed city governments were elected in every\r\n     municipality; we hail the National W. C. T. U. as an efficient\r\n     ally of the woman suffrage movement; we recognize the woman\r\n     suffrage resolutions of the Knights of Labor, the Land and Labor\r\n     organizations, the Third Party Prohibitionists and other\r\n     political parties, as evidence of a growing public sentiment in\r\n     favor of the equal rights of women; we rejoice that two-thirds of\r\n     the Northern Senators in the Congress of the United States voted\r\n     last winter for a Sixteenth Constitutional Amendment prohibiting\r\n     political distinctions on account of sex; we observe an\r\n     increasing friendliness in the attitude of press and pulpit and\r\n     the fact that 1,000 newspapers now publish a weekly column in the\r\n     interests of woman suffrage; we are encouraged by more general\r\n     discussions and more favorable votes of State Legislatures than\r\n     ever before--all indicating a sure and steady progress toward the\r\n     complete enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The woman suffragists of the United States were all\r\n     united until 1868 in the American Equal Rights Association; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The causes of the subsequent separation into the\r\n     National and the American Woman Suffrage Societies have since\r\n     been largely removed by the adoption of common principles and\r\n     methods, therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That Mrs. Lucy Stone be appointed a committee of one\r\n     from the American W. S. A. to confer with Miss Susan B. Anthony,\r\n     of the National W. S. A., and if on conference it seems\r\n     desirable, that she be authorized and empowered to appoint a\r\n     committee of this association to meet a similar committee\r\n     appointed by the National W. S. A., to consider a satisfactory\r\n     basis of union, and refer it back to the executive committees of\r\n     both associations for final action.\r\n\r\nA pleasant incident of the convention was the presentation to the\r\naudience of Mrs. E. R. Hunter, of Wichita, Kan., a real voter. Letters\r\nof greeting were read from Miss Matilda Hindman of Pennsylvania,\r\nSenator M. B. Castle of Illinois, Mrs. Mary B. Clay of Kentucky, and\r\nJudge Stanton J. Peelle of Indiana. Mrs. Stone, the Rev. Antoinette\r\nBrown Blackwell and Mrs. Mary A. Livermore were elected delegates to\r\nthe International Council of Women to be held in Washington, D. C., in\r\n1888, with Dr. Mary F. Thomas, Miss Mary Grew and Mrs. Hannah M. Tracy\r\nCutler as alternates.\r\n\r\nAfter Mrs. Howe's address on the last evening, The Battle Hymn of the\r\nRepublic was sung standing, the great assembly joining in the chorus.\r\nThe officers had the pleasure of visiting Bryn Mawr College, by\r\ninvitation of Dean M. Carey Thomas, during the convention.\r\n\r\nIn December of this year, a Suffrage Bazar was held in Boston for the\r\njoint benefit of the American W. S. A. and of the State suffrage\r\nassociations that participated,[143] which was a success both socially\r\nand financially. The _Woman's Journal_ of December 17 said:\r\n\r\n     Music Hall is a wonderful sight; the green and gold banner of\r\n     Kansas occupies the place of honor in the middle of the platform,\r\n     flanked on the left by the great crimson banner of Michigan with\r\n     its motto \"Neither delay nor rest,\" and on the right by the blue\r\n     flag of Maine, decorated with a pine branch and cones. The bronze\r\n     statue of Beethoven which has looked calmly down upon so many\r\n     different assemblages in Music Hall, gazes meditatively at the\r\n     Kansas table, with a large yellow sunflower which surmounts the\r\n     Kansas banner blazing like a great star at his very feet. Next\r\n     comes the banner of Vermont, rich and beautiful, though smaller\r\n     than the rest, in two shades of blue, with the seal of the State\r\n     in the center surrounded by wild roses and bearing the motto\r\n     \"Freedom and Unity.\" At the extreme right of the platform hangs\r\n     the banner of Pennsylvania, yellow, with heavy crimson fringe and\r\n     the motto \"Taxation _with_ Representation.\" On the other side of\r\n     Michigan is a large portrait of Wendell Phillips, sent by friends\r\n     in Minnesota. At the left are the _Woman's Journal_ exhibit,\r\n     press headquarters and a display of exquisite blankets made at\r\n     the Lamoille mills and contributed to the Vermont exhibit by the\r\n     manufacturer, Mrs. M. G. Minot.\r\n\r\n     All down the hall on both sides and across the middle hang the\r\n     many banners of the Massachusetts local leagues, of all sizes and\r\n     colors and with every variety of motto and device. At the extreme\r\n     end hangs the white banner of the State Association.\r\n\r\nThis handsome banner, bearing the motto, \"Male and female created He\r\nthem, and gave _them_ dominion,\" was presented to the association by\r\nMiss Cora Scott Pond and the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, to whose energetic\r\nwork the success of the bazar was largely due.\r\n\r\nMrs. Livermore, the president of the bazar, made the opening address\r\non the first evening. Floor and gallery were filled and scores of\r\nyellow-ribboned delegates threaded their way through the smiling\r\ncrowd. Mrs. Howe followed, saying in part:\r\n\r\n     Addresses this evening are something like grace before meat; they\r\n     are expected to be short and sweet. The grace is a good thing\r\n     because it reminds us that we do not live by bread alone but by\r\n     all the divine words with which the Creator has filled the\r\n     universe. The most divine word of all is justice, and in that\r\n     sacred name we are met to-night. In her name we set up our tents\r\n     and spread our banners....\r\n\r\n     In the suspense in which we have so long waited for suffrage, I\r\n     sometimes feel as if we were in a dim twilight through which at\r\n     last a single star sheds its way to show us there is light yet,\r\n     and then another and another star follow. Wyoming was the first,\r\n     the evening star--we may call her our Venus; then came Washington\r\n     Territory, and then Kansas. What sort of a star shall we call\r\n     Boston? She might aptly be compared to sleepy old Saturn,\r\n     surrounded by a triple ring of prejudice. Dr. Channing was asked\r\n     once if he did not despair of Harvard College. He replied: \"No, I\r\n     never _quite_ despair of anything.\" Therefore, following his good\r\n     example, I never quite despair of Boston. We want our flag to be\r\n     full of such stars as those I have mentioned.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lucy Stone closed a brief address by saying: \"To-morrow will be\r\nelection day and the papers urge all citizens to go and vote; but\r\nthere are 60,000 women in Boston who have the same interest in the\r\ncity government that men have, and yet can have no voice in the\r\nmatter. Make this bazar a success and so enable us to take\r\nMassachusetts by its four corners and shake it till it gives suffrage\r\nto women.\"\r\n\r\n_1888._--The twentieth annual meeting was held in Cincinnati, Ohio,\r\nNovember 20-22, with large crowds in attendance and much interest\r\nshown. The _Enquirer_ said: \"The audiences may be said to have\r\nchestnutized the time-honored assertion that advocates of the ballot\r\nfor the fair sex are unable to win even womankind to their way of\r\nthinking. New faces of ladies of the highest standing in society are\r\nseen at every succeeding session. The Scottish Rite Cathedral has\r\nrarely or never held as large a number of ladies, and equally rarely\r\nhas there been present at a meeting of woman suffragists so large a\r\nproportion of men.\" And the _Commercial Gazette_: \"The Scottish Rite\r\nCathedral never held a finer-looking company, composed as it was of a\r\nlarge number of the oldest and best citizens.\"\r\n\r\nThe Hon. Wm. Dudley Foulke presided.[144] Addresses of welcome were\r\nmade by the Hon. Alphonso Taft and Mrs. McClellan Brown, president of\r\nthe Wesleyan Woman's College. Mrs. Julia Ward Howe responded.\r\n\r\nIn a letter the Hon. George William Curtis said: \"Every change in the\r\nrestrictive laws regarding women is an acknowledgment of the justice\r\nof the demand for equal suffrage. The case was conceded when women\r\nbecame property holders and taxpayers in their own right. In every way\r\ntheir interest in society is the same as that of men, and the reason\r\nfor their voting in school meetings is conclusive for their voting\r\nupon the appropriation of other taxes which they pay.\"\r\n\r\nU. S. Senator George F. Hoar wrote: \"My belief in the wisdom and\r\njustice of the demand that women shall be admitted to the ballot\r\ngrows stronger every year.\" In a letter to Lucy Stone, Clara Barton\r\nwrote:\r\n\r\n     It gives me pain to be compelled to decline your generous\r\n     invitation to attend your annual meeting, but there is a deep\r\n     pleasure in the thought that you remembered and desired me to be\r\n     with you. Nowhere would I so gladly speak my little word for\r\n     woman, her rights, her needs, her privileges delayed and\r\n     debarred--yet blessed with the grand advance of the last thirty\r\n     years, the budding and blossoming of the seed sown in darkness,\r\n     doubt and humiliation, scattered by the winds of conscious\r\n     superiority and power and the whirlwinds of opposing wrath--as on\r\n     the green, native soil, the home of the early labors of its\r\n     sainted citizen, Frances D. Gage. Dear, noble, precious Aunt\r\n     Fanny, with the soul so pure and white, the heart so warm, the\r\n     sympathies so quick and ready, the sensitive, shrinking modesty\r\n     of self, the courage that scoffed at fear when the needs of\r\n     others were plead; the friend of the bondman and oppressed, who\r\n     knew no sect, sex, race or color, but toiled on for freedom and\r\n     humanity till the glorious summons came! If only five minutes of\r\n     her clarion voice could ring out in that meeting--McGregor on his\r\n     native heath--\"'twere worth a thousand men.\" I pray you, dear\r\n     friend, whose voice will reach and be heard, try to point out to\r\n     the younger and later workers of the grand, old State the broad\r\n     stubble swath of the scythe and the deep blazing of the sturdy\r\n     axe of this glorious pioneer of theirs--the grandest of them\r\n     all--whose sleeping dust is an honor to Ohio.\r\n\r\n     It is nothing that I am not there; it is much that you will be,\r\n     who carry back the memories of your girlhood, your school-life,\r\n     your earliest labors, to lay them on this freely-proffered altar,\r\n     in a spot where then there was no room for the tired foot, nor\r\n     scarce safety for the head. The occasion points with unerring\r\n     finger to the hands on the dial of thirty years in the future. We\r\n     need not to see it then, for it is given us to foresee it now.\r\n     God's blessing on this work and on the meeting, and on all who\r\n     may compose it![145]\r\n\r\nHenry B. Blackwell said in his address:\r\n\r\n     In equal suffrage lies our only hope of a representative\r\n     government. Women are one-half of our citizens with rights to\r\n     protect and wrongs to remedy. They are a distinct class in\r\n     society, differing from men in character, position and interest.\r\n     Every class that votes makes itself felt in the government. Women\r\n     will change the quality of government when they vote. They are\r\n     more peaceable, temperate, chaste, economical and law-abiding\r\n     than men; less controlled by physical appetite and passion; more\r\n     influenced by humane and religious considerations. They will\r\n     superadd to the more harsh and aggressive masculine qualities\r\n     those feminine qualities in which they are superior to men. And\r\n     these qualities are precisely what our government lacks. Women\r\n     will always be wives and mothers. They will represent the home as\r\n     men represent the business interests, and both are needed. This\r\n     is a reform higher, broader, deeper than any and all others. Let\r\n     good men and women of all sects, parties and opinions unite in\r\n     establishing a government of and by and for the people--men and\r\n     women.\r\n\r\nLucy Stone, describing the convention in the _Woman's Journal_ of\r\nDecember 1, wrote:\r\n\r\n     The local arrangements had been carefully made by Dr. Juliet M.\r\n     Thorpe, Mrs. Ellen B. Dietrick and Miss Annie McLean Marsh. The\r\n     spirit and temper of the meeting were of the best. Telegrams of\r\n     greeting were received from various States, and from far and near\r\n     came letters from those who were already friends of the cause,\r\n     and others who wished to learn. One old lady with snow-white\r\n     locks had come alone forty miles. She was not a delegate and she\r\n     had no speech to make, but her heart was in the work and she\r\n     found opportunity to speak words of cheer to those who were in\r\n     the thick of the fight. One young woman, a busy teacher, came\r\n     from Knoxville, Tenn. She wanted to know how to work for suffrage\r\n     in that State, and said she thought it \"the best way to come\r\n     where the suffrage was.\" A large supply of leaflets, copies of\r\n     the _Woman's Journal_ and of the _Woman's Column_, were given\r\n     her, with such advice and instruction as the time permitted. Two\r\n     ladies were there from Virginia. This was their first suffrage\r\n     meeting, but they listened eagerly, subscribed for our\r\n     periodicals and gladly accepted leaflets. It was a comfort to see\r\n     by these new recruits how widely the idea of equal rights for\r\n     women is taking root. At these annual meetings the workers who\r\n     come from far distant States and Territories strengthen each\r\n     other. The sight of their faces and the warm grasp of their hands\r\n     serve to renew the strength of those who never have flinched, and\r\n     who never will flinch till women are secure in possession of\r\n     equal rights.\r\n\r\n     A number of ladies who came over from Kentucky took the\r\n     opportunity to organize a Kentucky Equal Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n     It is always a matter of regret that the excellent speeches made\r\n     at these meetings can not be phonographically reported, but it\r\n     must suffice to say that they covered all the ground, from the\r\n     principles on which representative government rests, to the\r\n     teaching of the Bible, which Miss Laura Clay, in an able speech,\r\n     warmly claimed was on the side of equal rights for women. Mrs.\r\n     Zerelda G. Wallace, that noble mother in Israel, agreed with her,\r\n     though from a different point of view, while Frederick Douglass\r\n     claimed that the \"Eternal Right exists independent of all books.\"\r\n\r\n     The Cincinnati press gave noticeably friendly and fair reports.\r\n     Hospitality to delegates was abundant. The sunny side of many of\r\n     the best people of the Queen City was evidently turned toward\r\n     this meeting. A distinguished member of the Hamilton County bar,\r\n     who had not been thoroughly converted before, said: \"When you\r\n     come again, let me make the address of welcome!\"\r\n\r\nThe annual report of the chairman of the executive committee stated\r\nthat the association had continued to supply with suffrage matter all\r\neditors who would use it; and that to save postage this weekly\r\nbulletin had been put into the form of a small newspaper, the _Woman's\r\nColumn_:\r\n\r\n     Its woman suffrage arguments come back to us in papers scattered\r\n     from Maine to California, and reach hundreds of thousands of\r\n     readers who would not take a paper devoted specifically to this\r\n     reform.... Twenty thousand suffrage leaflets were given to the\r\n     Rev. Anna H. Shaw, national lecturer for the American W. S. A.,\r\n     whose position as national superintendent of franchise for the W.\r\n     C. T. U. enables her to use them with great effect; 7,700 were\r\n     made a gift to the Ohio Centennial Exposition at Cincinnati with\r\n     hundreds of copies of the _Woman's Journal_ and _Woman's Column_;\r\n     also many to the exposition at Columbus; 1,000 leaflets were sent\r\n     to the meeting of the Wisconsin W. S. A. at Milwaukee, and 500 to\r\n     its recent meeting at Stevens Point; many were sent to the fair\r\n     at Ottumwa, Ia.; a large number were distributed at the annual\r\n     meeting of the National W. C. T. U. in New York, and smaller\r\n     quantities have been supplied for local use in almost all the\r\n     States and Territories. Several friends have made donations of\r\n     money for this purpose, and there is no way in which money goes\r\n     further or does more good. In August, the association began the\r\n     publication of a series of tracts under the title of the _Woman\r\n     Suffrage Leaflet_. The association has given $50 for work in\r\n     Montana, $50 in Vermont, $25 in Wisconsin and $15 in New York.\r\n\r\nMemorial resolutions were adopted for Louisa M. Alcott, Dr. Mary F.\r\nThomas and James Freeman Clarke, D. D.\r\n\r\nThe following committee was chosen to continue the negotiations for\r\nunion with the National Woman Suffrage Association, which had been\r\nentered upon in pursuance of the resolution adopted at Philadelphia:\r\nthe Hon. William Dudley Foulke, Indiana; the Rev. Anna H. Shaw,\r\nMichigan; Miss Laura Clay, Kentucky; Mrs. Margaret W. Campbell, Iowa;\r\nProf. W. H. Carruth, Kansas; Miss Mary Grew, Pennsylvania; the Rev.\r\nAntoinette Brown Blackwell, New Jersey; Mrs. Sarah C. Schrader, Ohio;\r\nMrs. Catherine V. Waite, Illinois; Mrs. May S. Knaggs, Michigan; Miss\r\nAlice Stone Blackwell, Massachusetts.\r\n\r\n_1889._--In January these delegates met with those from the National\r\nAssociation at the convention of the latter in Washington, D. C., and\r\narrangements for the union of the two societies for the following year\r\nwere practically completed.[146]\r\n\r\nIn the summer an appeal was addressed by Lucy Stone, Julia Ward Howe\r\nand Mary A. Livermore to the constitutional conventions which were\r\npreparing for Statehood in Dakota, Washington, Montana and Idaho. It\r\nsaid in part:\r\n\r\n     The undersigned, officers of the American Woman Suffrage\r\n     Association, though not properly entitled to address your\r\n     convention, nevertheless ask its courtesy on account of the great\r\n     interest they feel in the question of the status you will give to\r\n     women.\r\n\r\n     You, gentlemen, felt keenly the disadvantage you were under when\r\n     you had only Territorial rights. If you will consider how much\r\n     greater are the disadvantages of a class that is wholly without\r\n     political rights, you will, we feel sure, pardon our entreaty\r\n     that in building your new constitution you will secure for women\r\n     equal political rights with men.\r\n\r\n     The men of the older States inherited their constitutions, with\r\n     the odious features which the common law imposes upon women. But\r\n     you are making constitutions. You have the golden opportunity to\r\n     save your women from all these evils by securing their right to\r\n     vote in the organic law of the new State. By doing this, over and\r\n     above the satisfaction which comes from having done a just deed,\r\n     you will win the gratitude of women for all time, as our fathers\r\n     won the gratitude of the race when they announced the principle\r\n     which we ask you to apply. You will also secure the historic\r\n     credit of being the first men to take the next great step in\r\n     civilization--a step sure to be taken at no distant day....\r\n\r\n     Edward Everett once said, illustrating the effect of small things\r\n     on character: \"The Mississippi and the St. Lawrence Rivers have\r\n     their rise near each other. A very small difference in the\r\n     elevation of the land sends one to the ocean amid tropical heat,\r\n     while the other empties into the frozen waters of the north.\" So,\r\n     it may seem a small matter whether you admit or shut out women\r\n     from an equal share in the government. But if you exclude them\r\n     you shut out a class of citizens pre-eminently orderly,\r\n     law-abiding and peaceful, and especially interested in the\r\n     welfare of the home and the safety of society. If, at the same\r\n     time, you admit all classes of men, however worthless, provided\r\n     they are out of prison, and if you make them free to stamp their\r\n     impress upon the government, in the long run you will find the\r\n     moral tone of the community lowered and cheapened, and your most\r\n     sacred institutions imperiled by the dangerous classes to whom\r\n     you entrusted the power which you denied to orderly and good\r\n     women.\r\n\r\nHenry B. Blackwell, secretary of the association, visited North\r\nDakota, Montana and Washington, and personally labored with the\r\nmembers of the three constitutional conventions. He carried with him\r\nletters written expressly for these conventions by Governor Francis E.\r\nWarren and U. S. Delegate Joseph M. Carey of Wyoming; Governor Lyman\r\nU. Humphrey, Attorney-General L. B. Kellogg, Chief Justice Albert H.\r\nHorton and all the Judges of the Supreme Court of Kansas; U. S.\r\nSenator Henry M. Teller of Colorado, U. S. Senator Cushman K. Davis of\r\nMinnesota, Governor Oliver Ames, U. S. Senator George F. Hoar, William\r\nLloyd Garrison and others of Massachusetts, commending his mission and\r\nexpressing the hope that the new States would incorporate equal\r\nsuffrage in their constitutions. Copies of these letters were placed\r\nin the hands of every delegate. Mr. Blackwell devoted over a month to\r\nthe journey and the work in these Territories, paying his own expenses\r\nand giving them and his services to the American Suffrage Association.\r\n[Detailed accounts of these efforts will be found in chapters on these\r\nthree States.]\r\n\r\n_1890._--In February the American and the National Societies held a\r\nconvention in Washington under the name of the National-American\r\nAssociation and this body has continued its annual meetings as one\r\norganization.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[135] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Alice Stone\r\nBlackwell, editor of _The Woman's Journal_, Boston, Mass.

There have been described also the hearings before committees\r\nof Congress, at which the advocates of this measure have made pleas\r\nfor the submission to the State Legislatures of a Sixteenth Amendment\r\nto the Federal Constitution which should prohibit disfranchisement on\r\naccount of sex, as the Fifteenth Amendment does on account of\r\ncolor--pleas which a distinguished Senator, who reported against\r\ngranting them, said \"surpassed anything he ever had heard, and whose\r\nlogic if used in favor of any other measure could not fail to carry\r\nit\" (p. 201); and of which another, who had the courage to report in\r\nfavor, declared, \"The suffragists have logic, argument, everything on\r\ntheir side\" (p. 162).\r\n\r\nIn addition to this national work the following chapters will show\r\nthat the State work has been continued on similar lines--State and\r\nlocal conventions and appeals to Legislatures to submit an amendment\r\nto the electors to strike the word \"male\" from the suffrage clause of\r\ntheir own State constitution. These appeals, in many instances, have\r\nbeen supported by larger petitions than ever presented for any other\r\nobject.\r\n\r\nFurther efforts have been made on a still different line, viz.:\r\nthrough attempts to secure from outside conventions an indorsement of\r\nwoman suffrage, not only from those of a political but also from those\r\nof a religious, educational, professional or industrial nature. This\r\nhas been desired in order that the bills may go before Congress and\r\nLegislatures with the all-important sanction of voters, and also\r\nbecause of its favorable effect on those composing these conventions\r\nand on public sentiment.\r\n\r\nThe idea of asking for recognition from a national political\r\nconvention was first suggested to Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Miss\r\nSusan B. Anthony in 1868. By their protests against the use of the\r\nword \"male\" in the Fourteenth Amendment, as described in Chap. I of\r\nthis volume, they had angered the Republican leaders, some of whom,\r\neven those who favored woman suffrage, sarcastically advised them to\r\nask the Democrats for indorsement in their national convention of this\r\nyear and see what would be the response. These two women, therefore,\r\ndid appear before that body, which dedicated the new Tammany Hall in\r\nNew York City, on July 4. An account of their insulting reception may\r\nbe found in the History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. II, p. 340, and in the\r\nLife and Work of Susan B. Anthony, p. 304. They, with Abby Hopper\r\nGibbons, daughter of Isaac T. Hopper, and Elizabeth Smith Miller,\r\ndaughter of Gerrit Smith, previously had sent an earnest letter to the\r\nNational Republican Convention which had met in Chicago in June,\r\nasking in the name of the women who had rendered the party such\r\nfaithful service during the Civil War, that it would recognize in its\r\nplatform their right to the suffrage, but the letter received no\r\nnotice whatever.\r\n\r\nFrom that year until the present a committee of women has attended\r\nevery national convention of all the parties, asking for an\r\nindorsement or at least a commendation of their appeal for the\r\nfranchise. Sometimes they have been received with respect, sometimes\r\nwith discourtesy, and occasionally they have been granted a few\r\nminutes to make their plea before the Committee on Resolutions. In but\r\na single instance has any one of these women, the most eminent in the\r\nnation, been permitted to address a Republican convention--at\r\nCincinnati in 1876. Twice this privilege has been extended by a\r\nDemocratic--at St. Louis in 1876 and at Cincinnati in 1880. A far-off\r\napproach to a recognition of woman's claim was made by the National\r\nRepublican Convention at Philadelphia in 1872, in this resolution:\r\n\r\n     The Republican party, mindful of its obligations to the loyal\r\n     women of America, expresses gratification that wider avenues of\r\n     employment have been opened to woman, and it further declares\r\n     that her demands for additional rights should be treated with\r\n     respectful consideration.\r\n\r\nAgain in 1876 the national convention, held in Cincinnati, adopted the\r\nfollowing:\r\n\r\n     The Republican party recognizes with approval the substantial\r\n     advance recently made toward the establishment of equal rights\r\n     for women by the many important amendments effected by the\r\n     Republican (!) Legislatures, in the laws which concern the\r\n     personal and property relations of wives, mothers and widows, and\r\n     by the election and appointment of women to the superintendence\r\n     of education, charities and other public trusts. The honest\r\n     demands of this class of citizens for additional rights,\r\n     privileges and immunities should be treated with respectful\r\n     consideration.\r\n\r\nIn 1880, '84, '88 and '92 the women were wholly disregarded. The\r\nnational platform of 1888, however, contained this plank:\r\n\r\n     We recognize the supreme and sovereign right of every lawful\r\n     citizen to cast one free ballot in all public elections and to\r\n     have that ballot duly counted.\r\n\r\nThe leaders of the woman suffrage movement at once telegraphed to\r\nChicago to the chairman of the convention, the Hon. Morris M. Estee,\r\nasking if this statement was intended to include \"lawful women\r\ncitizens,\" and he answered, \"I do not think the platform is so\r\nconstrued here.\" A letter was addressed to the presidential candidate,\r\nGen. Benjamin Harrison, begging that in his acceptance of the\r\nnomination, he would interpret this declaration as including women,\r\nbut it was politely ignored.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 Miss Anthony appeared before the Resolutions Committee of the\r\nnational convention in Minneapolis and in an address of thirty minutes\r\npleaded that women might have recognition in its platform. At the\r\nclose many of the members assured her of their thorough belief in the\r\njustice of woman suffrage, but said frankly that \"the party could not\r\ncarry the load.\"[147] The following was the suffrage plank in its\r\nplatform that year:\r\n\r\n     We demand that every citizen of the United States shall be\r\n     allowed to cast one free and unrestricted ballot in all public\r\n     elections, and that such ballot shall be counted as cast; that\r\n     such laws shall be enacted and enforced as will secure to every\r\n     citizen, be he rich or poor, native or foreign, white or black,\r\n     this sovereign right guaranteed by the constitution. The free and\r\n     honest popular ballot, the just and equal representation of all\r\n     the people, as well as their just and equal protection under the\r\n     laws, are the foundation of our republican institutions, and the\r\n     party will never relax its efforts until the integrity of the\r\n     ballot and the purity of elections shall be guaranteed and\r\n     protected in every State.\r\n\r\nBut not once during the campaign did the party speakers or newspapers\r\napply this declaration to the women citizens of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, when the prospects of success seemed certain enough to\r\njustify the party in assuming some additional \"load,\" the women made\r\nthe most impassioned appeal to the committee at the St. Louis\r\nconvention, with the following remarkable result:\r\n\r\n     The Republican party is mindful of the rights and interests of\r\n     women. Protection of American industries includes equal\r\n     opportunities, equal pay for equal work, and protection to the\r\n     home. We favor the admission of women to wider spheres of\r\n     usefulness, and welcome their co-operation in rescuing the\r\n     country from Democratic mismanagement and Populist misrule.\r\n\r\nA whole plank to exploit Republicanism and a small splinter to cajole\r\nthe women, who had not asked for the suffrage to \"rescue\" or to defeat\r\nany political party!\r\n\r\nNo Democratic national platform ever has recognized so much as the\r\nexistence of women, in all its grandiloquent declarations of the\r\n\"rights of the masses,\" the \"equality of the people,\" the \"sovereignty\r\nof the individual\" and the \"powers inherent in a democracy.\"\r\n\r\nThe Populists at the beginning of their career sounded the slogan,\r\n\"Equal rights to all, special privileges to none,\" and many believed\r\nthat at length the great party had arisen which was to secure to women\r\nthe equal right in the suffrage which thus far had been the special\r\nprivilege of men. Full of joy and hope there went to the first\r\nnational convention of this party, held in Omaha, July 4, 1892, Susan\r\nB. Anthony and the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, president and\r\nvice-president-at-large of the National Suffrage Association. To their\r\namazement they were refused permission even to appear before the\r\nCommittee on Resolutions, a courtesy which by this time was usually\r\nextended at all political conventions. The platform contained no woman\r\nsuffrage plank and no reference to the question except that in the\r\nlong preamble occurred this sentence:\r\n\r\n     We believe that the forces of reform this day organized will\r\n     never cease to move forward until every wrong is righted, and\r\n     equal rights and equal privileges securely established for all\r\n     the men and women of this country.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the Populist National Convention in St. Louis effected its\r\ngreat fusion with the Democrats, and the political rights of women\r\nwere hopelessly lost in the shuffle. By 1900 the organization was\r\nthoroughly under Democratic control, and the expectations of women to\r\nsecure their enfranchisement through this \"party of the people,\"\r\ncreated to reform all abuses and abolish all unjust discriminations,\r\nvanished forever. It must be said to its credit, however, that during\r\nits brief existence women received more recognition in general than\r\nthey ever had had from the old parties. They sat as delegates in its\r\nnational and State conventions and served on National and State\r\nCommittees; they were employed as political speakers and organizers;\r\nand they were elected and appointed to official positions. Various\r\nState and county conventions declared in favor of enfranchising women,\r\nthe majority of the legislators advocated it, and there is reason to\r\nbelieve that in those States where an amendment to secure it was\r\nsubmitted, individual Populists very largely voted for it.\r\n\r\nThe Prohibition National Conventions many times have put a woman\r\nsuffrage plank in their platforms, and women have served as delegates\r\nand on committees. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union forms the\r\nbulwark of this party, and, like its distinguished president, Miss\r\nFrances E. Willard, her successor, Mrs. Lillian M. N. Stevens, is an\r\nearnest advocate of the enfranchisement of women, which is also true\r\nof the vast majority of its members, so it has not been necessary for\r\nthe Woman Suffrage Association to send delegates to the national\r\nconventions, although it has occasionally done so. These have\r\nfrequently failed, however, to adopt a plank declaring for woman\r\nsuffrage, the refusal to do so at Pittsburg in 1896 being a principal\r\ncause of the division in the ranks which took place at that time.\r\n\r\nThe Greenback party, the Labor party, the various Socialist parties,\r\nand other reform organizations of a political character have made\r\nunequivocal declarations for woman suffrage and welcomed women as\r\ndelegates. Whether they would do so if strong enough to have any hope\r\nof electing their candidates must remain an open question until\r\npractically demonstrated.[148]\r\n\r\nWomen have served a number of times as delegates in the national\r\nconventions of most of the so-called Third parties. In 1892 they\r\nappeared for the first time at a Republican National Convention,\r\nserving as alternates from Wyoming. In 1896 women alternates were sent\r\nfrom Utah to the Democratic National Convention. In 1900 Mrs. W. H.\r\nJones went as delegate from that State to the Republican, and Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Cohen to the Democratic National Convention, and both\r\ndischarged the duties of the position in a satisfactory manner. Mrs.\r\nCohen seconded the nomination of William J. Bryan. A newspaper\r\ncorrespondent published a sensational story in regard to her bold and\r\nnoisy behavior, but afterwards he was compelled to retract publicly\r\nevery word of it and admit that it had no foundation.\r\n\r\nDoubtless Miss Anthony has attended more political conventions to\r\nsecure recognition of the cause which she represents than any other\r\nwoman, and also has presented the subject to more national conventions\r\nof various associations. In early days this was because she was one of\r\nthe few who had the courage to take this new and radical step, and\r\nalso because she was the only one who made the suffrage the sole\r\nobject of her life and was ready and willing to work for it at all\r\ntimes and under all circumstances. In later days her name has carried\r\nso much weight and she is so universally respected that she has been\r\nable to obtain a hearing and often a resolution where this would be\r\ndifficult if not impossible for other women. However, in national and\r\nState work of this kind she has had the valuable co-operation of the\r\nablest women of two generations. In no way can the scope and extent of\r\nthese efforts be better understood than by reviewing Miss Anthony's\r\nreport to the National Suffrage Convention of 1901, as chairman of\r\nthe Committee on Convention Resolutions. It is especially interesting\r\nas a fair illustration of the vast amount of work which women have\r\nbeen doing in this direction for the past thirty years.\r\n\r\nAfter stating that the names and home addresses of most of the\r\ndelegates to all the national political conventions of 1900 were\r\nobtained, Miss Anthony submitted copies of four letters of which 4,000\r\nwere sent in June from the national suffrage headquarters in New York,\r\nsigned by herself and the other members of the committee--Carrie\r\nChapman Catt, Anna Howard Shaw, Ida Husted Harper and Rachel Foster\r\nAvery.\r\n\r\n     (To the Republican delegates.)\r\n\r\n     The undersigned Committee, appointed by the National-American\r\n     Woman Suffrage Association, beg leave to submit to you, as\r\n     delegate to the approaching Republican Convention, the enclosed\r\n     Memorial.\r\n\r\n     The Republican party was organized in response to the demand for\r\n     human freedom. Its platform for the last forty years has been an\r\n     unswerving declaration for liberty and equality. Animated by the\r\n     spirit of progress, it has continued to enlarge the voting\r\n     constituency from time to time, thus acknowledging the right of\r\n     the individual to self-representation. This principle was\r\n     embodied in the plank adopted at the Chicago convention of 1888,\r\n     and has been often reaffirmed: \"We recognize the supreme and\r\n     sovereign right of every lawful citizen to cast one free ballot\r\n     in all public elections and have that ballot duly counted.\" We\r\n     appeal to the Republican party to sustain its record by applying\r\n     this declaration to the lawful women citizens of the United\r\n     States.\r\n\r\n     You will observe that this petition does not ask you to endorse\r\n     the enfranchisement of women, but simply to recommend that\r\n     Congress submit this question to the decision of the various\r\n     State Legislatures. In the name of American womanhood we ask you\r\n     to use every means within your power to bring this matter to a\r\n     discussion and affirmative vote in your convention.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     (To the Democratic delegates.)\r\n\r\n     Since its inception the Democratic party has had for its rallying\r\n     cry the immortal words of Thomas Jefferson, \"No taxation without\r\n     representation,\" \"Governments derive their just powers from the\r\n     consent of the governed.\" Under this banner wage-earning men,\r\n     native and foreign, were endowed with the franchise, by which\r\n     means alone an individual can represent himself or consent to his\r\n     government, and by this act the party was kept in power for\r\n     nearly sixty years.\r\n\r\n     At the close of the eighteenth century this was a broad view for\r\n     even so great a leader to take. In this closing year of the\r\n     nineteenth century it would show an equally progressive spirit\r\n     if his loyal followers would carry these splendid declarations to\r\n     their logical conclusion and enfranchise women.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     (To the Populist delegates.)\r\n\r\n     At the very first National Convention of the People's Party, held\r\n     at Omaha in 1892, the preamble of their platform declared that\r\n     \"equal rights and privileges must be securely established for all\r\n     the men and women of the country.\" In the majority of State\r\n     conventions held since that time there has been specific\r\n     recognition of equal political rights for women. By admitting\r\n     women as delegates in their representative assemblies and by\r\n     appointing them to State and local offices, the Populists have\r\n     put into practice this fundamental principle of their\r\n     organization. Therefore, in asking you to give your influence and\r\n     vote in favor of this petition, we are proposing only that you\r\n     shall reaffirm your previous declarations.\r\n\r\n            *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n     (To the Prohibition delegates.)\r\n\r\n     Judging from the honorable record made by your party upon this\r\n     subject, we have every reason to hope that you will give your\r\n     influence and your vote in favor of the petition contained\r\n     herein.\r\n\r\nIn the Democratic letter was enclosed an Open Letter from Gov. Charles\r\nS. Thomas (Dem.) of Colorado, setting forth in the strongest manner\r\nthe advantages of woman suffrage, and in all was placed favorable\r\ntestimony from prominent men of the respective States, accompanied by\r\nthe following Memorial. The latter was mailed also to every member of\r\nthe Resolutions Committees, and 10,000 copies were sent to editors and\r\notherwise circulated throughout the country.\r\n\r\n     MEMORIAL\r\n\r\n     TO THE NATIONAL PRESIDENTIAL CONVENTION OF 1900.\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN: You are respectfully requested by the\r\n     National-American Woman Suffrage Association to place the\r\n     following plank in your platform:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we favor the submission by Congress, to the\r\n     various State Legislatures, of an Amendment to the Federal\r\n     Constitution forbidding disfranchisement of United States\r\n     citizens on account of sex.\r\n\r\n     The chief contribution to human liberty made by the United States\r\n     is the establishment of the right of personal representation in\r\n     government. In other countries suffrage often has been called\r\n     \"the vested right of property,\" and as such has been extended to\r\n     women the same as to men. Our country at length has come to\r\n     recognize the principle that the elective franchise is inherent\r\n     in the individual and not in his property, and this principle has\r\n     become the corner-stone of our republic. Up to the beginning of\r\n     the twentieth century, however, the application of this great\r\n     truth has been made to but one-half the citizens.\r\n\r\n     The women of the United States are now the only disfranchised\r\n     class, and sex is the one remaining disqualification. A man may\r\n     be idle, corrupt, vicious, utterly without a single quality\r\n     necessary for purity and stability of government, but through the\r\n     exercise of the suffrage he is a vital factor. A woman may be\r\n     educated, industrious, moral and law-abiding, possessed of every\r\n     quality needed in a pure and stable government, but, deprived of\r\n     that influence which is exerted through the ballot, she is not a\r\n     factor in affairs of State. Who will claim that our government is\r\n     purer, wiser, stronger and more lasting by the rigid exclusion of\r\n     what men themselves term \"the better half\" of the people?\r\n\r\n     Every argument which enfranchises a man, enfranchises a woman.\r\n     There is no escape from this logic except to declare sex the just\r\n     basis of suffrage. But this position can not be maintained in\r\n     view of the fact that women already have full suffrage in\r\n     Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Idaho, municipal suffrage in Kansas,\r\n     school suffrage in twenty-five States, a vote on tax levies in\r\n     Louisiana, on bond issues in Iowa, and on minor questions in\r\n     various other States. They have every franchise except the\r\n     Parliamentary in England, Scotland and Ireland, the full ballot\r\n     in New Zealand and South and West Australia, and some form of\r\n     suffrage in every English colony. In a large number of the\r\n     monarchical countries certain classes of women vote. On this\r\n     fundamental question of individual sovereignty surely the United\r\n     States should be a leader and not a follower. The trend of the\r\n     times is clearly toward equal suffrage. It will add to the credit\r\n     and future strength of any party to put itself in line with the\r\n     best modern and progressive thought on this question.\r\n\r\n     In the division of the world's labor an equal share falls to\r\n     woman. As property holder and wage-earner her material stake in\r\n     the government is equal to that of man. As wife, as mother, as\r\n     individual, her moral stake is certainly as great as his. The\r\n     perpetuity of the republic depends upon the careful performance\r\n     of the duties of both. One is just as necessary as the other to\r\n     the growth and prosperity of the country. All of these\r\n     propositions are self-evident, but they are wholly foreign to the\r\n     question at issue. The right of the individual to a vote is not\r\n     founded upon the value of his stake in government, upon his moral\r\n     character, his business ability or his physical strength, but\r\n     simply and solely upon that guarantee of personal representation\r\n     which is the essence of a true republic, a true democracy.\r\n\r\n     The literal definition of these two terms is, \"a State in which\r\n     the sovereign power resides in the whole body of the people and\r\n     is exercised by representatives elected by them.\" By the\r\n     Declaration of Independence, by the rules of equity, by the laws\r\n     of justice, women equally with men are entitled to exercise this\r\n     sovereign power, through the franchise, the only legal means\r\n     provided. But whatever may be regarded as the correct basis of\r\n     suffrage--character, education, property, or the inherent right\r\n     of the person who is subject to law and taxation--women possess\r\n     all the qualifications required of men.\r\n\r\n     At this dawn of a new century are not the sons of the\r\n     Revolutionary Fathers sufficiently progressive to remove the\r\n     barriers which for more than a hundred years have prevented women\r\n     from exercising this citizen's right? We appeal to this great\r\n     national delegate body, representing the men of every State,\r\n     gathered to outline the policy and select the head of the\r\n     Government for the next four years, to adopt in your platform a\r\n     declaration approving the submission by Congress of an amendment\r\n     enfranchising women. We urge this action in order that the\r\n     question shall be carried to the various Legislatures, where\r\n     women may present their arguments before the representative men,\r\n     instead of being compelled to plead their cause before each\r\n     individual voter of the forty-one States where they are still\r\n     disfranchised.\r\n\r\n     We make this earnest appeal on behalf of the hundreds of\r\n     thousands of women who, from year to year, have petitioned\r\n     Congress to take the action necessary for their enfranchisement;\r\n     and of those millions who are so engrossed in the struggle for\r\n     daily bread, or in the manifold duties of the home, that they are\r\n     compelled to leave this task to others. We make it also on behalf\r\n     of the generations yet to come, for there will be no cessation of\r\n     this demand until this highest privilege of citizenship has been\r\n     accorded to women.\r\n\r\n     ELIZABETH CADY STANTON,      } Honorary Presidents.\r\n     SUSAN B. ANTHONY,            }\r\n\r\n                CARRIE CHAPMAN CATT, President.\r\n\r\n     HARRIET TAYLOR UPTON,        ANNA HOWARD SHAW,\r\n                   Treasurer.                  Vice-President-at-Large.\r\n\r\n     LAURA CLAY,                  RACHEL FOSTER AVERY,\r\n                   First Auditor.              Corresponding Secretary.\r\n\r\n     CATHARINE WAUGH MCCULLOCH,   ALICE STONE BLACKWELL,\r\n                   Second Auditor.                 Recording Secretary.\r\n\r\n     Headquarters, National-American Woman Suffrage Association,\r\n              2008 American Tract Society Building,\r\n                         New York City.\r\n\r\nFour women were permitted to appear before a sub-committee of the\r\nCommittee on Platform at the Republican National Convention at\r\nPhiladelphia, in 1900. They met with a polite but chilly reception\r\nand were informed that they could have ten minutes to present\r\ntheir case. This time was occupied by the president and the\r\nvice-president-at-large in concise but forcible arguments on the duty\r\nof the party to recognize their claim for enfranchisement. The\r\nplatform eventually contained the following plank:\r\n\r\n     We congratulate the women of America upon their splendid record\r\n     of public service in the Volunteer Aid Association, and as nurses\r\n     in camp and hospital during the recent campaigns of our armies in\r\n     the Eastern and Western Indies, and we appreciate their faithful\r\n     co-operation in all works of education and industry.\r\n\r\nIn other words, being asked to recognize women as political factors,\r\nthe committee responded by commending them as nurses!\r\n\r\nThis plank was written by Mrs. J. Ellen Foster, who as president of\r\nthe Woman's National Republican League and a campaign speaker, has\r\ndone far more for the party than any other woman, and originally it\r\nended with this clause: \"We regard with satisfaction their unselfish\r\ninterest in public affairs in the four States where they have already\r\nbeen enfranchised, and their growing interest in good government and\r\nRepublican principles.\" But even so small a recognition as this of\r\nwomen in political life was ruthlessly struck out by the committee.\r\n\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt and Miss Mary G. Hay attended the Democratic\r\nNational Convention at Kansas City and were not allowed to address any\r\ncommittee, but the platform contained the Declaration of Independence\r\nas its preamble!\r\n\r\nThe Populist national platform adopted at Sioux City did not contain\r\neven a reference to women or their rights and privileges.\r\n\r\nThe Prohibition convention followed its action of 1896 and put no\r\nwoman suffrage plank in its platform. A separate resolution was passed\r\nexpressing a favorable regard but carrying no official weight.\r\n\r\nThe only national political convention in 1900 which adopted a plank\r\ndeclaring for the enfranchisement of women was that of the\r\nSocial-Democratic party at Indianapolis.\r\n\r\nIn not one of the four largest parties were the delegates in\r\nconvention given so much as an opportunity to discuss and vote on a\r\nresolution to enfranchise women. All these heroic efforts, all these\r\nnoble appeals, had not the slightest effect because made by a class\r\nutterly without influence by reason of this very disfranchisement\r\nwhich it was struggling to have removed. At every political convention\r\nall matters of right, of justice, of the eternal verities themselves,\r\nare swallowed up in the one all-important question, \"Will it bring\r\nparty success?\" And to this a voteless constituency can not contribute\r\nin the smallest degree, even though it represent the Ten Commandments,\r\nthe Sermon on the Mount, the Golden Rule, the Magna Charta and the\r\nDeclaration of Independence.\r\n\r\nParadoxical as it may seem, notwithstanding the refusal of the\r\nResolutions Committees of all these national bodies to grant even an\r\nindirect recognition of woman suffrage in their platforms, its\r\nadvocates never before found such a general sentiment in its favor\r\namong the individual delegates. In a number of instances they were\r\ntold that a poll of delegations had shown a majority of the members to\r\nbe ready to vote for it. It was demonstrated beyond doubt that the\r\nrank and file of the delegates, if freed from hostile influences among\r\ntheir constituents and granted the sanction of the political leaders,\r\ncould be won to a support of the measure, but that at present it must\r\nwait on party expediency. As every campaign brings with it national\r\nissues on which each party makes a fight for its life, and which it\r\nfears to hamper by any extraneous questions; as the elements most\r\nstrongly opposed to the enfranchisement of women not only are fully\r\narmed with ballots themselves but are in complete control of an\r\nimmense force similarly equipped; and as the vote of women is so\r\nproblematical that none of the parties can claim it in advance, it is\r\nimpossible to foresee when and how they are to obtain political\r\nfreedom. The one self-evident fact is, however, that in order to win\r\nit they must be supported by a stronger public sentiment than exists\r\nat present, and that this can be secured only through a constant\r\nagitation of the subject.\r\n\r\nA return to Miss Anthony's report will illustrate other methods\r\nadopted to bring this question to the attention of the public. \"During\r\nthe year I have also sent petitions and letters to more than one\r\nhundred national conventions of different sorts--industrial,\r\neducational, charitable, philanthropic, religious and political.[149]\r\nBelow are the forms of petition:\"\r\n\r\n     _To the Senate and House of Representatives of the Fifty-sixth\r\n     Congress of the United States:_\r\n\r\n     The undersigned on behalf of (naming the association) in annual\r\n     convention assembled at ......, ......, 1900, and representing\r\n     fully ...... members, respectfully ask for the prompt passage by\r\n     your Honorable Body of a _Sixteenth Amendment_ to the Federal\r\n     Constitution, to be submitted to the Legislatures of the several\r\n     States for ratification, prohibiting the disfranchisement of\r\n     United States citizens on account of sex.\r\n\r\n                                   ................, President.\r\n                                   ................, Secretary.\r\n\r\n     _To the Senate and House of Representatives of the Fifty-sixth\r\n     Congress of the United States:_\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The trend of civilization is plainly in the direction of\r\n     equal rights for women, and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Woman suffrage is no longer an experiment, but has been\r\n     clearly demonstrated to be beneficial to society; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we, on behalf of [as above], do respectfully\r\n     petition your Honorable Body not to insert the word \"male\" in the\r\n     suffrage clause of whatever form of government you shall\r\n     recommend to Hawaii, Cuba, Porto Rico or any other newly-acquired\r\n     possessions. We ask this in the name of justice and equality for\r\n     all citizens of a republic founded on the consent of the\r\n     governed.[150]\r\n\r\n\"A number of large associations adopted these and returned them to me\r\nduly engrossed on their official paper, signed by the president and\r\nsecretary and with their seal affixed; and I forwarded all to the\r\nSenators and Representatives whom I thought most likely to present\r\nthem to Congress in a way to make an impression.\r\n\r\n\"The General Federation of Labor at Detroit was the first to respond.\r\nI was invited to address its annual convention and, after I had\r\nspoken, the four hundred delegates passed a resolution of thanks to\r\nme, adopted the above petition for the Sixteenth Amendment by a rising\r\nvote, and ordered their officers to sign it in the name of their one\r\nmillion constituents.\r\n\r\n\"The National Building Trades Council at Milwaukee had an able\r\ndiscussion in its annual meeting, based on my letter, and adopted both\r\npetitions. This body has half a million members.\r\n\r\n\"The Bricklayers' and Masons' International Union of America was held\r\nin Rochester, and invited me to address the delegates. They received\r\nme with enthusiasm, passed strong woman suffrage resolutions and\r\nsigned both petitions. Afterwards a stenographic report of my speech,\r\ncovering two full pages of their official organ, _The Bricklayer and\r\nMason_, was published with an excellent portrait of myself, thus\r\nsending me and my argument to each one of their more than sixty\r\nthousand members, all of whom subscribe to this paper as part of their\r\ndues to the union.\r\n\r\n\"The National Grange, which has indorsed woman suffrage for so many\r\nyears, adopted the resolutions and petitions.\r\n\r\n\"At the Federation of Commercial Schools of the United States and\r\nCanada, which met in Chicago, my letter was read, the question was\r\nthoroughly discussed and the suffrage petitions were adopted almost\r\nunanimously.\r\n\r\n\"The Columbia Catholic Summer School, held at Detroit, gave a hearing\r\nto our national president, Mrs. Chapman Catt, at which she is said to\r\nhave made many converts. A strong suffrage speech was made by the Rev.\r\nFather W. J. Dalton, and other prominent members expressed themselves\r\nin favor.\r\n\r\n\"The contents of my letters to religious and educational bodies can\r\nreadily be imagined, and one which was sent to the United States\r\nBrewers' Association, in convention at Atlantic City, N. J., may be\r\ncited as an example of the subject-matter of those to other\r\norganizations:\r\n\r\n     GENTLEMEN: As chairman of the committee appointed by our National\r\n     Suffrage Association to address letters to the large conventions\r\n     held this year, allow me to bring before you the great need of\r\n     the recognition of women in all of the rights, privileges and\r\n     immunities of United States citizenship.\r\n\r\n     Though your association has for its principal object the\r\n     management of the great brewing interests of this country, yet I\r\n     have noted that you have adopted resolutions declaring against\r\n     woman suffrage. I therefore appeal to you, since the question\r\n     seems to come within the scope of your deliberations, to reverse\r\n     your action this closing year of the century, and declare\r\n     yourselves in favor of the practical application of the\r\n     fundamental principles of our Government to all the people--women\r\n     as well as men. Whatever your nationality, whatever your\r\n     religious creed, whatever your political party, you are either\r\n     born or naturalized citizens of the United States, and because of\r\n     that are voters of the State in which you reside. Will you not,\r\n     gentlemen, accord to the women of this nation, having the same\r\n     citizenship as yourselves, precisely the same privileges and\r\n     powers which you possess because of that one fact?\r\n\r\n     The only true principle--the only safe policy--of a\r\n     democratic-republican government is that every class of people\r\n     shall be protected in the exercise of the right of individual\r\n     representation. I pray you, therefore, to pass a resolution in\r\n     favor of woman suffrage, and order your officers, on behalf of\r\n     the association, to sign a petition to Congress for this\r\n     purpose, and thereby put the weight of your influence on the side\r\n     of making this Government a genuine republic.\r\n\r\n     Should you desire to have one of our best woman suffrage speakers\r\n     address your convention, if you will let me know as soon as\r\n     possible, I will take pleasure in arranging for one to do so.\r\n\r\n\"This was read to the convention, and the secretary, Gallus Thomann,\r\nthus reported its action to me:\r\n\r\n     Mr. Obermann [ex-president of the association and one of the\r\n     trustees] voicing the sentiments of the delegates, spoke as\r\n     follows: \"Miss Susan B. Anthony is entitled to the respect of\r\n     every man and woman in this country, whether agreeing with her\r\n     theories or not. I think it but fair and courteous to her that\r\n     the secretary be instructed to answer that letter, and to inform\r\n     Miss Anthony that this is a body of business men; that we meet\r\n     for business purposes and not for politics. Furthermore, that she\r\n     is mistaken and misinformed so far as her statement is concerned\r\n     that we have passed resolutions opposing woman suffrage. _We have\r\n     never taken such action at any of our conventions or on any other\r\n     occasion._ I submit this as a motion.\"\r\n\r\n     The motion was unanimously adopted, and that part of Mr.\r\n     Obermann's remarks which related to the respect due Miss Anthony\r\n     was loudly and enthusiastically applauded.\r\n\r\n     To the sentiment thus expressed, permit me, dear Miss Anthony, to\r\n     add personally the assurance of my highest esteem.\r\n\r\n\"Among the results of the work with State conventions it may be\r\nmentioned that the Georgia Federation of Labor, the Minnesota\r\nFederation of Labor, the State Teachers' Association of Washington and\r\nthe New York State Grange signed the petitions and passed the\r\nresolutions.\r\n\r\n\"As another branch of the work, copies of these two petitions were\r\nsent to each of the forty-five States and three Territories, with\r\nletters asking the suffrage presidents, where associations existed,\r\nand prominent individuals in the few States where they did not, to\r\nmake two copies of each petition on their own official paper, sign\r\nthem on behalf of the suffragists of the State, and return them to me\r\nto be sent to the members of Congress from the respective districts.\r\nThis was done almost without exception and these petitions were\r\npresented by various members, one copy in the Senate and one in the\r\nHouse. Of all the State petitions, the most interesting was that of\r\nWyoming, which, in default of a suffrage association (none being\r\nneeded) was signed by every State officer, from the Governor down, by\r\nseveral United States officials, and by many of the most influential\r\nmen and women. With it came a letter from the wife of ex-U. S. Senator\r\nJoseph M. Carey, who collected these names, saying the number was\r\nlimited only by the brief space of time allowed.\r\n\r\n\"In all, more than two hundred petitions for woman suffrage from\r\nvarious associations were thus sent to Congress in 1900, representing\r\nmillions of individuals. Many cordial responses were received from\r\nmembers, and promises of assistance should the question come before\r\nCongress, but there is no record of the slightest attempt by any\r\nmember to bring it before that body.\r\n\r\n\"In doing this work I wrote fully a thousand letters to associations\r\nand individuals, in all of which I placed some of our best printed\r\nliterature. There was a thorough stirring up of public sentiment which\r\nmust have definite results in time, for it should not be forgotten\r\nthat in addressing conventions we appeal to the chosen leaders of\r\nthought and work from many cities and States, and so set in motion an\r\never-widening circle of agitation in countless localities.\"\r\n\r\nA most valuable means of educating public sentiment is the securing of\r\na Woman's Day at Chautauqua Assemblies and State and county fairs,\r\nwhen good speakers present the \"woman question\" in its various phases,\r\nincluding always the need for enfranchisement. The Rev. Anna Howard\r\nShaw and Mrs. Chapman Catt, the leading orators of the country, have\r\naddressed Chautauquas in all parts of the United States, as well as\r\ncountless other large gatherings which have no connection with\r\nsuffrage, being thus enabled to propagate the principle over a vast\r\narea. It can be seen from the above résumé that the ground of effort\r\nis widely extended and that the harvest is ripening, but alas, there\r\nis a constant repetition of the old, old cry, \"The laborers are few.\"\r\nOne can only repeat what has often been said, that never before were\r\nsuch results as can be seen on every hand in the improved conditions\r\nfor women and the advanced public sentiment in favor of a full\r\nequality of rights, accomplished by so small a number of workers and\r\nunder such adverse conditions. Perhaps this will continue to be said\r\neven unto the end, but their labors will know neither faltering nor\r\ncessation until the original object, as announced over fifty years\r\nago, has been attained, viz.: the full enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[147] See Life and Work of Susan B.

XIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIV.\r\n\r\nTHE RIGHTS OF WOMEN IN THE STATES.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe preceding chapters have been devoted principally to efforts made\r\nin behalf of women by the National-American Suffrage Association\r\nthrough its conventions, committees, officers, speakers, organizers\r\nand members. Contemporaneous with this line of action there has been\r\nfor a number of years a similar movement in the respective States\r\ncarried forward through their associations auxiliary to the National,\r\ntheir committees, officers, speakers, organizers and individual\r\nmembership. Each of the two divisions has been largely dependent upon\r\nthe other, the States forming the strength of the national body, the\r\nlatter extending assistance to the States whenever a special campaign\r\nhas been at hand or help has been needed in organizing, convention or\r\nlegislative work. The following chapters are confined wholly to the\r\nsituation in the various States and are subdivided into Organization,\r\nLegislative Action, Laws, Suffrage, Office-Holding, Occupations and\r\nEducation. Their object is to give a general idea of the status of\r\nwoman at the close of the nineteenth century and the manifold changes\r\nof which it is the result. It is desired also to put on record the\r\npart which women themselves have had in the steady advance which will\r\nbe observed.\r\n\r\nThe account of only the past seventeen years is given, as the three\r\npreceding volumes of this History relate in detail the pioneer work\r\nand the gains made previous to 1884. Unfortunately it is inevitable in\r\na recital of this kind that many names should be omitted which are\r\nquite as worthy of mention as those that find place, for in some\r\ninstances the records are imperfectly kept and in others the list is\r\nso long as to forbid reproduction.[151] It has been necessary to bar\r\ncompliments in order to avoid unjust discrimination and to meet the\r\ndemands of limited space. To posterity the work is of more importance\r\nthan the workers, and those who have engaged in the efforts to improve\r\nthe condition of women necessarily have had to possess a spirit of\r\nself-abnegation and self-sacrifice which neither expected nor desired\r\npersonal rewards.\r\n\r\nThe subject of Organization in most of the States is treated in the\r\nbriefest possible manner, the intention being merely to show that in\r\nevery State and Territory there has been some attempt to gather into a\r\nworking force the scattered individuals who believe in the justice of\r\nwoman suffrage and wish to obtain it. More extended mention of course\r\nis due to the older States, where there has been continuous organized\r\nwork for many years, and where the societies have remained intact and\r\nheld their regular meetings in spite of such defeats and\r\ndiscouragements as never have had to be faced by any other cause. It\r\nis most difficult to form and maintain an association which has not a\r\nconcrete object to labor for, and when a campaign for an amendment is\r\nnot actually in progress, the suffrage in the distant future appears\r\nlargely as an abstraction. The early days of the movement necessarily\r\nhad to be given to creating the sentiment which would later be\r\norganized, and it is only within the past decade that the time has\r\nseemed ripe for systematic effort in this direction. The lack of\r\neffective organization has been a serious but unavoidable weakness\r\nwhich henceforth will be remedied as speedily and thoroughly as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIt is a favorite argument of the opponents of woman suffrage that the\r\nmany gains of various kinds have not been due to the efforts of women\r\nthemselves. Under the head of Legislative Action will be found the\r\ndates and figures to prove that, year after year, in almost every\r\nState, women have gone to the Legislatures with appeals for every\r\nconcession which has been granted and many more which have been\r\nrefused. The bills presented by the Woman's Christian Temperance Union\r\nhave not been specifically included because they are fully recorded in\r\nthe publications of that body, and because this volume is confined\r\nalmost exclusively to the one subject of enfranchisement. While the\r\nSuffrage Associations have directed their legislative efforts\r\nprincipally to secure action for this purpose, individual members have\r\njoined the W. C. T. U. innumerable times in its attempts to obtain\r\nother bills of advantage to women and children, and in some instances\r\nthis has been done officially by the associations.\r\n\r\nAmong various measures in which the two organizations have united may\r\nbe mentioned the raising of the \"age of protection\" for girls; the\r\nsecuring of women physicians in all institutions where women and\r\nchildren are confined, and women on the boards of all such; women city\r\nphysicians; matrons at jails and station houses; better conditions for\r\nworking women; the abolition of child-labor; industrial schools for\r\ngirls. Measures which have been especially championed by the W. S. A.,\r\nbut which the W. C. T. U. has aided officially or individually, have\r\nbeen those asking for every form of suffrage; equal property laws for\r\nwives; the opening of all educational institutions to women; their\r\nadmission to all professions and occupations; the repeal of laws\r\nbarring them from office; the enactment of laws giving father and\r\nmother equal guardianship of children.[152]\r\n\r\nThe W. C. T. U. alone has secured temperance measures of many kinds,\r\nincluding a law in every State requiring scientific temperance\r\ninstruction in the public schools; in many States curfew laws, and\r\nstatutes prohibiting the sale of cigarettes and of liquor on or near\r\nfair grounds, Soldiers' Homes and school-houses, and preventing\r\ngambling devices, immoral exhibits, etc. The Federation of Women's\r\nClubs has obtained laws for free traveling libraries and has united\r\nwith other organizations in various States in efforts for equal\r\nguardianship of children, school suffrage, women on school and library\r\nboards and the abolishing of child labor. Other associations have\r\njoined in one or more of the above lines of work and have had\r\nindependent measures of their own, such as prison reform, social\r\npurity, the assistance of different races--as the negro and the\r\nIndian--village improvement, kindergartens, public playgrounds, etc.\r\n\r\nIt would not be possible to draw a distinct line dividing the\r\nlegislative work of one association from the others, except that it\r\nmay be said the suffrage societies have made the franchise their chief\r\npoint, believing it to be the power with which the rest could be\r\ngained, and the temperance unions have made their principal attack\r\nupon the liquor traffic, considering it the greatest evil. The objects\r\nof the various bodies are indicated in the last chapter of this volume\r\non Organizations of Women, but whatever these may be, if they include\r\nany direct, practical work their promoters usually find themselves at\r\nthe door of the Legislature asking for help. Here they get their first\r\nlesson in the imperative necessity of possessing a vote, and seeing\r\ntheir measures fail because asked for by a disfranchised class, to\r\nwhom the legislators are in no way indebted, they frequently become\r\nardent advocates of suffrage for women.\r\n\r\nAs it would be wholly impossible in the small space which can be\r\nallowed to include an account of all the legislative work done by\r\nwomen, mention is made principally of that for the franchise. While\r\nthe successes have been few compared to the number of bills presented,\r\nthe record is valuable as indicating that determined and persistent\r\neffort will not be relaxed until it is granted in every State.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of Legislation is related also the attempts to get from\r\nConstitutional Conventions an amendment striking out the word \"male\"\r\nas a qualification for suffrage. It includes, besides, graphic\r\naccounts of the campaigns made in behalf of such amendments when\r\nsubmitted to the voters by the Legislatures. Those who have not\r\nclosely followed these events doubtless will be surprised to learn the\r\namount of effort which has been expended by women to obtain the\r\nfranchise. It is infinitely greater than has been put forth for this\r\npurpose by all other classes combined, since the Revolutionary War was\r\nfought to secure to every citizen the right of individual\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nThe Laws regarding women as here given are in no sense of the word a\r\n\"brief,\" but merely present the facts in the language of a layman and\r\nin the simplest and most concise form. Those relating to property are\r\nin the nature of a curiosity. An attorney in San Francisco who was\r\nasked for information as to the laws in general for women in\r\nCalifornia, answered that to give in full those of property alone\r\nwould require as much space as could be granted in the History for the\r\nentire chapter. It is not possible to make in these introductory\r\nparagraphs an adequate digest of these laws in various States. They\r\nare not precisely the same in any two of the forty-nine States and\r\nTerritories, and they offer a striking illustration of the attempts of\r\nlaw-makers, during the last few decades, to rectify in a measure the\r\nlegal outrages of the past, and of their inability in the present\r\nstate of their development to grant absolute justice. That must await\r\nthe lawmakers of the future, and probably the time when women shall\r\nhave a part in selecting them.\r\n\r\nAll that can be claimed for the statutes quoted herein is that they\r\nare as nearly correct as it has been possible to make them. With but\r\none or two exceptions, the Attorney-Generals in every State have been\r\nmost courteous and obliging when appealed to for assistance. The laws\r\nfor women, however, have been so taken from and added to, so torn to\r\npieces and patched up, that the best lawyers in many States say\r\nfrankly that they do not know just what they are at the present time.\r\nLegislatures and code revision committees are continually tinkering at\r\nthem and every year witnesses some changes in most of the States.[153]\r\nA very thorough abstract of the laws, made in 1886 by Miss Lelia J.\r\nRobinson, LL. B., a member of the bar in Massachusetts, was of almost\r\nno use in the compilation for this volume because of the endless\r\nalterations since that time. The Legal Status of Women, a condensed\r\nrésumé issued in 1897 by the National Suffrage Association, has been\r\ncovered thickly with pencil marks during the preparation of this\r\nsummary, as the reports received from different States have shown the\r\nchanges effected in the few years which have since elapsed. A new\r\nbook, Woman and the Law, prepared by a lecturer on political science\r\nin one of our largest universities and published in 1901, was hailed\r\nwith joy, but was found to include a number of laws which had been\r\nrepealed within the past four or five years and to omit some very\r\nimportant ones which had been enacted during this time, as well as to\r\ncontain frequent mistakes in regard to others.\r\n\r\nThese instances show the impossibility of an absolutely authentic\r\npresentation of the laws for women in their constantly changing\r\ncondition. Although it was the intention to close this History with\r\n1900, in several States, notably Massachusetts, Connecticut, New York,\r\nIllinois and Wisconsin, laws have been passed since that date of\r\nsufficient importance to demand a place. During the two years of its\r\npreparation the entire codes of property laws for women in\r\nMassachusetts and Virginia have been revolutionized.\r\n\r\nAn amusing part of a difficult task has been the reluctance of men to\r\nadmit the existence of laws which are conspicuously unjust to women,\r\nthe admission being frequently accompanied by the statement that it is\r\nthe intention to change them at an early date, or that it would only\r\nbe necessary to call the attention of the Legislature to them in order\r\nto secure their repeal. Even women themselves in States where the\r\nstatutes especially discriminate against them, have written that these\r\nmust not be published unless those from all the others are given.\r\nWhether this is due to State pride or personal humiliation is not\r\nclearly evident.\r\n\r\nThe one encouraging feature is that in almost every State decided\r\nprogress is shown since 1848, when in New York and Pennsylvania the\r\nfirst change was made in the English Common Law which then everywhere\r\nprevailed, and which did not permit a married woman to hold property,\r\nto buy or sell, to sue or be sued, to make a contract or a will, to\r\ncarry on business in her own name, to possess the wages she earned, or\r\nto have her children in case of divorce. An examination of the laws in\r\nthe following chapters will show that the wife now may own and control\r\nher separate property in three-fourths of the States, and in the other\r\nfourth only one Northern State is included. In every State a married\r\nwoman may make a will, but can dispose only of her separate property.\r\nIn about two-thirds of the States she possesses her earnings. In the\r\ngreat majority she may make contracts and bring suit. The property\r\nrights of unmarried women always have been nearly the same as those of\r\nunmarried men, but the Common Law declared that \"by marriage husband\r\nand wife are one person in law and the legal existence of the wife is\r\nmerged in that of the husband. He is her baron or lord, bound to\r\nsupply her with shelter, food, clothing and medicine, and is entitled\r\nto her earnings and the use and custody of her person, which he may\r\nseize wherever he may find it.\" (Blackstone, I, 442.)[154]\r\n\r\nIn his Commentaries, after enumerating some of the disabilities of\r\nwoman under these laws, Blackstone calmly argues that the most of them\r\nwere really intended for her benefit, \"so great a favorite is the\r\nfemale sex with the law of England.\" He strikes here the keynote of\r\neven the special statutes which have superseded the Common Law in the\r\nvarious States, all have been \"intended for her benefit,\" man alone\r\nbeing the judge of what she needed and careful while providing it to\r\nretain within himself the exclusive power of law-making. It has been\r\ngradually dawning upon him, however, that, as a human being like\r\nhimself, her needs are very similar to his own, and where he has\r\nfailed to see it she has reminded him of it as she has slowly learned\r\nthis fact herself. The laws show an awakening conscience on the part\r\nof men and a tardy but continuous advance toward justice to women,\r\nalthough there is yet very much to be desired. For instance, in\r\nreading the laws regarding the inheritance of separate property, which\r\nin a number of States is now made the same for widow and widower, the\r\nfirst thought will be, \"These are absolutely just.\" But a little\r\ninvestigation will show that the separate property of either is what\r\nhe or she possesses at marriage or receives afterwards by gift or\r\ninheritance, while all that is acquired during marriage by the joint\r\nearnings of the two belongs to the husband. In many States the law now\r\nprovides that if the wife engages in business as a sole trader or goes\r\noutside the home to work, her earnings belong to her, but all the\r\nproceeds of her labor within the household are still the sole and\r\nseparate property of the husband. The Common Law on this point, which\r\nnever has been changed in a single State,[155] makes the services of\r\nthe wife belong to the husband, and in return she is legally entitled\r\nonly to food, shelter and clothes, and these of such quality and\r\nquantity as the husband dictates. She can not dispose by will of any\r\nof the property acquired during marriage, nor has she any control of\r\nit during the husband's lifetime.\r\n\r\nThese facts should be borne in mind when reading the laws which\r\ndeclare that husband and wife have the same power to dispose of\r\nseparate property. Comparatively few women in this country have\r\nproperty when married, especially if young at the time, and the same\r\nis true of the majority of men, but afterwards the woman may never\r\nhope to accumulate any, as the joint earnings of the marriage\r\npartnership belong exclusively to the husband, and the duties of the\r\naverage household prevent the wife from engaging in outside work.\r\nHowever, in order that she might not be left absolutely penniless\r\nafter years of labor, the Common Law provided that she should be\r\nentitled to \"dower,\" i. e., the possession, for her lifetime, of\r\none-third of all the real estate of which her husband was possessed in\r\nfee simple during the marriage. That is, she should receive the\r\nlife-use of one-third of any realty she might have brought into the\r\nmarriage and one-third of all they had earned together. But if the\r\nhusband had converted these into cash, bonds, stocks or other personal\r\nproperty, she could legally claim nothing. He had \"curtesy,\" i. e.,\r\nthe life-use of all her real estate, (sometimes dependent on the birth\r\nof children, sometimes not), and usually the whole of her personal\r\nestate absolutely.\r\n\r\nCurtesy has now been abolished in over one-half the States. The law of\r\ndower still exists in more than one-half, but special statutes in\r\nregard to personal property and the wife's separate estate have been\r\nmade so liberal that in comparatively few States is she left in the\r\nhelpless condition of olden times. In about one-half of them she takes\r\nfrom one-third to the whole (if there are no children) of both real\r\nand personal estate absolutely; but in all of them it is only at the\r\ndeath of the husband that she has any share or control of the joint\r\naccumulations except such as he chooses to allow. At the death of the\r\nwife all of these belong legally to the husband and she can not secure\r\nto her children or her parents any part of the property which she has\r\nhelped to earn. Space forbids going into a discussion of the general\r\nupheaval which follows the death of the husband, the inventories\r\nwhich must be taken, the divisions which must be made, generally\r\nresulting in the breaking up of the home; while at the death of the\r\nwife all passes peacefully into the possession of the husband and\r\nthere is no scattering of the family unless he wishes it. A general\r\nbut necessarily superficial statement of the property laws will be\r\nfound in connection with each State in the following chapters, and\r\nthey represent a complete legal revolution during the past half\r\ncentury.\r\n\r\nFathers and mothers are given equal guardianship of children in the\r\nDistrict of Columbia and nine States--Colorado, Connecticut, Illinois,\r\nKansas, Maine, Massachusetts, Nebraska, New York and Washington. (See\r\nPennsylvania.) In all others the father has the sole custody and\r\ncontrol of the persons, education, earnings and estates of minor\r\nchildren. Where this right is abused the mother can obtain custody\r\nonly by applying for separation or divorce or proving in court the\r\nunfitness of the father. In a number of States the father may by will\r\nappoint a guardian even of a child unborn, to the exclusion of the\r\nmother. In others the widow is legally entitled to the guardianship\r\nbut forfeits it by marrying again. Others do not permit a widow to\r\nappoint by will a guardian for her children. Tennessee and Louisiana\r\noffer examples of the English and French codes in this respect.\r\n\r\nAlthough the father is the sole guardian and entitled to the services\r\nof the children, and although the joint earnings of the marriage\r\nbelong exclusively to him, and in a number of States he is declared in\r\nthe statutes to be the \"head of the family,\" in many of them the\r\nmother is held to be equally liable for its support. Her separate\r\nproperty may be taken for this purpose and she is also required to\r\ncontribute by her labor. In such cases the husband decides what\r\nconstitutes \"necessities\" and the wife must pay for what he orders. A\r\nrecent decision of the Illinois courts compelled a wife to pay for the\r\nclothes of an able-bodied husband. In most but not all of the States\r\nthe husband, if competent, is punished for failure to support his\r\nfamily. The punishment consists in a fine, the State thus taking from\r\nthe family what money he may possess; or confinement in prison, where\r\nhe is boarded and lodged while the family is in nowise relieved.\r\n\r\nIt has not been deemed necessary to consider at length the subject of\r\ndivorce, except to mention the laws of the few States which\r\ndiscriminate against women. South Carolina is the only one which does\r\nnot grant divorce; New York the only one which makes adultery the sole\r\ncause. In the remainder the causes have a wider range, but in all the\r\nrecords show that the vast majority of divorces are granted to wives.\r\nThe following list is taken from the New York _Sun_ (1902) and\r\ncorresponds with information gathered from other sources:\r\n\r\n  Habitual drunkenness, in all except eight States.\r\n  Wilful desertion, generally.\r\n  Felony, in all except three.\r\n  Cruelty, and intolerable cruelty, in all except five.\r\n  Failure by the husband to provide, in twenty.\r\n  Fraud and fraudulent contract, in nine.\r\n  Absence without being heard from, for different periods, in six.\r\n  Ungovernable temper, in two.\r\n  Insupportably cruel treatment, outrages and excesses, in six.\r\n  Indignities rendering life burdensome, in six.\r\n  Attempt to murder other party, in three.\r\n\r\n  Insanity or idiocy at time of marriage, in six. Insanity lasting\r\n  ten years, in Washington; incurable insanity, in North Dakota,\r\n  Florida and Idaho.\r\n\r\n  Husband notoriously immoral before marriage, unknown to wife,\r\n  in West Virginia. [Pregnancy of wife before marriage, unknown\r\n  to husband, in many States].\r\n  Fugitive from justice, in Virginia.\r\n  Gross misbehavior or wickedness, in Rhode Island.\r\n  Any gross neglect of duty, in Kansas and Ohio.\r\n  Refusal of wife to remove into the State, in Tennessee.\r\n  Mental incapacity at time of marriage, in Georgia.\r\n  Three years with any religious society that believes the marriage\r\n  relation unlawful, in Massachusetts; and joining any such sect, in\r\n  New Hampshire.\r\n  When parties can not live in peace and union, in Utah.\r\n  Vagrancy of the husband, in Missouri and Wyoming.\r\n  Excesses, in Texas.\r\n  Where wife by cruel and barbarous treatment renders condition\r\n  of husband intolerable, in Pennsylvania.\r\n\r\nBy reference to the History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. I, pp. 482, 717,\r\n745 and following, it will be seen that the resolutions favoring\r\ndivorce for habitual drunkenness offered in the first women's\r\nconventions, during the early '50's, almost disrupted the meetings,\r\nand caused press and pulpit throughout the country to thunder\r\ndenunciations, but half a century later such laws exist in\r\nthirty-seven of the forty-five States and meet with general approval.\r\nIt is frequently charged that the granting of woman suffrage has been\r\nfollowed by laws for free divorce, but an examination of the statutes\r\nwill show that exactly the same causes obtain in the States where\r\nwomen do not vote as in those where they do; that there has not been\r\nthe slightest change in the latter since the franchise was given them;\r\nand that in Wyoming, where it has been exercised since 1869, there is\r\nthe smallest percentage of divorce in proportion to the population of\r\nany State in the Union. The three places which are so largely utilized\r\nby outsiders who wish a speedy divorce, because only a ninety days'\r\nresidence is required, are North and South Dakota and Oklahoma, in\r\nneither of which have women any suffrage except for school trustees.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of consent or protection\" for girls, i. e., the age when they\r\nare declared to have sufficient understanding to consent to\r\nintercourse, and above which they can claim no legal protection, was\r\nfixed at ten years by the Common Law. No action was taken by any State\r\nto advance the age up to which they might be protected until 1864,\r\nwhen Oregon raised it to fourteen years. No other State followed this\r\nexample until 1882, when Wyoming made it fourteen. In 1885 Nebraska\r\nadded two years making it twelve. At this date women commenced to\r\nbesiege the Legislatures in all parts of the country, and there was a\r\ngeneral movement from that time forward to have the age of protection\r\nincreased, but in almost every instance where this has been\r\naccomplished, the penalty for violation of the law has been reduced,\r\nand now in thirteen States no minimum penalty is named. The age still\r\nremains at ten years in Florida, Georgia, Mississippi, North and South\r\nCarolina. In Kentucky, Louisiana, Tennessee and West Virginia the age\r\nis twelve years, but in Tennessee it is only a \"misdemeanor\" between\r\ntwelve and sixteen. (For the recent efforts of women in Georgia and\r\nFlorida to have the age advanced, and their failure, see the chapters\r\non those States.) In Delaware the Common Law age of ten years was\r\nreduced to seven by the Legislature in 1871, and no protection was\r\nafforded to infants over seven until 1889 when the age was raised to\r\nfifteen, but the crime was declared to be only a \"misdemeanor.\"\r\n\r\nWomen who have \"all the rights they want,\" and men who insist that\r\n\"the laws are framed for the best interests of women,\" are recommended\r\nto make a study of those presented herewith.\r\n\r\nUnder the head of Suffrage it is stated whether women possess any form\r\nof it and, if so, in what it consists. The story of the four States\r\nwhere they have the complete franchise--Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and\r\nIdaho--naturally is most interesting, as it describes just how this\r\nwas obtained and gives considerable information on points which are\r\nnot fully understood by the general public. The chapter on Kansas\r\ndoubtless will come next in interest, as there women have had the\r\nMunicipal ballot since 1887. It is frequently said in criticism that\r\nwomen have School Suffrage in twenty-six States and Territories,\r\nincluding the five mentioned above, but they do not make use of it in\r\nlarge numbers. What this fragmentary suffrage includes, the\r\nrestrictions thrown around it and the obstacles placed in its way, are\r\ndescribed in the chapters of those States and Territories where it\r\nprevails--Arizona, Connecticut, Delaware, Illinois, Kentucky,\r\nMassachusetts, Minnesota, Michigan, Montana, Nebraska, North Dakota,\r\nNew Hampshire, New Jersey, New York, Ohio, Oklahoma, Oregon, South\r\nDakota, Vermont, Washington, Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that in New York women tax-payers in villages, and in\r\nLouisiana and Montana all tax-paying women, may vote on questions\r\nsubmitted for taxation, and an account is given of the first use which\r\nwomen made of this privilege in Louisiana in 1899. In Iowa all women\r\nmay vote on the issuing of bonds. In Mississippi they have the merest\r\nform of a franchise on a few matters connected with country schools\r\nand the running at large of stock. In Arkansas they may sign a\r\npetition against liquor selling within certain limits and their names\r\ncount for as much as men's. After a careful study of the situation the\r\nwonder will not be that women do not exercise more largely these\r\ngrudgingly-given and closely-restricted privileges, but that in many\r\nStates they think it worth while to exercise them at all. In the four,\r\nhowever, where they have the Full Suffrage, and in Kansas where they\r\nhave the Municipal, the official figures which have been carefully\r\ntabulated will demonstrate beyond further controversy that where they\r\npossess exactly the same electoral rights as men they use them in\r\neven a larger proportion. These statistics answer conclusively the\r\nquestion, \"Do women want to vote?\"\r\n\r\nThe information as to Office-Holding is necessarily somewhat desultory\r\nas there is no record in any State of the women in office. This is\r\ntrue even of those pertaining to the schools, and in very few cases\r\ndoes the State Superintendent of Public Instruction know how many\r\nwomen are serving as county superintendents and members of school\r\nboards. The information on these points contained in the State\r\nchapters was secured principally through personal investigation and by\r\nan extended correspondence, and while it is believed to be entirely\r\ncorrect so far as it goes, it does not by any means include the total\r\nnumber of offices filled by women. Imperfect as is the list it will be\r\na surprise to those who look upon office-holding as the natural\r\nprerogative of man. A stock objection to woman suffrage is that women\r\nwill be wanting the offices. An examination of the reports here\r\nsubmitted will disclose the surprising fact that in a number of States\r\nwhere women do not vote they are filling as many offices as in those\r\nwhere they have the full franchise. Probably the majority of State\r\nconstitutions declare that the offices must be held by electors, but\r\nwhere this proviso is not made, women have been elected and appointed\r\nto various offices and so far as can be learned have given general\r\nsatisfaction.[156]\r\n\r\nThe necessity for matrons at police stations and jails, and for women\r\nphysicians in all institutions where women and children are confined,\r\nis too evident to need any argument in its favor, and yet it is only\r\nwithin the past ten years that they have been thus employed to any\r\nextent and even now they are found in only a small fraction of such\r\ninstitutions. The objection to these matrons on the part of the police\r\nforce has been strenuous, and yet, almost without exception, after\r\nthey have gained a foothold, the police officers testify that they do\r\nnot understand how the department got on without them. It ought to be\r\nequally evident that there should be women on the boards of all\r\ninstitutions which care for women and children, but, although in most\r\ninstances these positions have no salary, there is the most violent\r\nopposition to giving women a place, and the concession has had to be\r\nwrung from Legislatures in the few States where it has been obtained.\r\nThe right of women and their value to school offices is now partly\r\nconceded in about half the States. Women librarians also have met with\r\nsome favor. As to offices in general, most of which carry either\r\nsalary or patronage or both, they will continue to be regarded as\r\nbelonging entirely to voters and as perquisites of party managers with\r\nwhich to reward political service, although all of them are\r\nproportionately supported by women tax-payers.\r\n\r\nAs regards Occupations, the census of 1900 shows 3,230,642 women\r\nengaged in wage-earning employments, exclusive of domestic service,\r\nand the question of their admittance to practically all such may be\r\nregarded as settled, but it has not been gained without a contest.\r\nWomen, however, are still barred from the best-paying positions and\r\nare usually compelled to accept unequal wages for equal work. This is\r\npartly due to disfranchisement and partly to economic causes and can\r\nbe remedied only by time. In many of the States of which it is said,\r\n\"No profession is forbidden to women,\" the test has not been made, and\r\nuntil some woman attempts to be a minister, physician, lawyer or\r\nnotary public it can not be known whether she will encounter a\r\nstatutory prohibition.\r\n\r\nThe department of Education presents the most satisfactory condition.\r\nThe battle for co-education, which means simply a chance for women to\r\nhave the best advantages which exist, has been bitterly fought. A\r\nguerilla warfare is still maintained against it, but the contest is so\r\nnearly finished as to warrant no fears as to the future. Every State\r\nUniversity but those of Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina and\r\nVirginia, is open to women on exactly the same terms as to men (with\r\nthe exception of some departments of Pennsylvania). They have full\r\nadmission to Chicago and Leland Stanford Universities, two of the\r\nlargest in the United States. They may enter the post-graduate\r\ndepartment of Yale and receive its degrees. Harvard and Princeton are\r\nstill entirely closed to them, as are a number of the smaller of the\r\nold, established Eastern universities, but this is largely compensated\r\nby the great Woman's Colleges of the East--Bryn Mawr, Wellesley, Smith\r\nand Vassar--which accommodate nearly 4,000 students. The Medical\r\nDepartment of Johns Hopkins, and Medical, Theological, Law and Dental\r\nColleges in all parts of the country, admit women to their full\r\ncourses. This is true also of Agricultural Colleges and of Technical\r\nInstitutes such as Drexel and Pratt. There is now no lack of\r\nopportunity for them to obtain the highest education, either along the\r\nline of general culture or specialized work.[157]\r\n\r\nThe details of the following chapters will show that the civil, legal,\r\nindustrial and educational rights of women are so far secured as to\r\ngive full assurance that they will be absolute in the near future. The\r\npolitical rights are further off, for reasons which are presented in\r\nthe introduction to this volume, but the yielding of all the others is\r\nproof sufficient that the spirit of our institutions will eventually\r\nfind its fullest expression in perfect equality of rights for all the\r\npeople.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[151] The names of newspapers which have supported this cause are not\r\ngiven, partly for these reasons and partly because on this question\r\nthey reflect simply the personal views of the editors, and a change of\r\nmanagement may cause a complete reversal of their attitude toward\r\nwoman suffrage.\r\n\r\n[152] A reading of these chapters will show that the suffrage\r\nsocieties have started many progressive movements and then turned them\r\nover to other organizations of women, believing they would thrive\r\nbetter if freed from the effects of the prejudice against woman\r\nsuffrage and everything connected with it.\r\n\r\n[153] Notwithstanding these efforts, the very statutes which are\r\nintended to be fair to women are continually found to be defective,\r\nand whenever any doubt arises as to their construction the Common Law\r\nmust prevail, which in all cases is unjust to women. An example of\r\nthis kind will be found in the chapter on New York, showing that it\r\nwas held in 1901 that a wife's wages belonged to her husband, although\r\nit was supposed that these had been secured to her beyond all question\r\nby a special statute of 1860.\r\n\r\n[154] For abstract of the Common Law in regard to women see History of\r\nWoman Suffrage, Vol. III, p. 961.\r\n\r\n[155] A few of the States were formed under the Spanish or French code\r\ninstead of the English Common Law, but neither was more favorable to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n[156] No mention is made of women postmasters as these are found in\r\nall States. The first were appointed by President Grant during his\r\nfirst term of office, 1868-1872.\r\n\r\n[157] In the various States under the head of Education, Roman\r\nCatholic colleges and universities are not considered, as they are\r\nnowhere co-educational.\r\n\r\nThe public school statistics are taken from the reports for 1898-9 of\r\nthe U. S. Commissioner of Education.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXV.\r\n\r\nALABAMA.[158]\r\n\r\n\r\nActual work for woman suffrage in Alabama began in 1890, at the time\r\nthe constitutional convention of Mississippi was in session. The\r\neditor of the New Decatur _Advertiser_ opened his columns to all\r\nmatter on the question and thus aroused local interest, which in 1892\r\nculminated in the formation in that town of the first suffrage club in\r\nthe State, with seven charter members. The women who thus faced a most\r\nconservative public sentiment were Mesdames Harvey Lewis, F. E.\r\nJenkins, E. G. Robb, A. R. Rose, B. E. Moore, Lucy A. Gould and Ellen\r\nStephens Hildreth.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the year a second club was formed in Verbena by\r\nMiss Frances A. Griffin, who has since become noted as a public\r\nspeaker for this cause. Others were soon established through the\r\nefforts of Mesdames Minnie Hardy Gist, Bessie Vaughn, M. C. Arter, W.\r\nJ. Sibert and Miss B. M. Haley.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 and 1893 the _Woman's Column_, published in Boston, was sent\r\nby the National Association to 1,500 teachers, ministers, school\r\nsuperintendents, editors, legislators and other prominent people, the\r\nnames being furnished by Mrs. Hildreth. A State organization was\r\neffected in 1893, with Mrs. Hildreth, president, and Miss Griffin,\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Miss Susan B. Anthony, president of the National Association,\r\nand Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of its organization committee,\r\nwho were making a southern tour, were asked by the New Decatur Club to\r\ninclude that city in their itinerary. They were also invited by Mrs.\r\nAlberta Taylor to address her society at Huntsville. These visits of\r\nthe great leader and her eloquent assistant aroused much interest, but\r\nthe financial depression prevented active work.\r\n\r\nMrs. Virginia Clay Clopton was elected State president in 1896; Mrs.\r\nAnnie D. Shelby, Mrs. Milton Hume and Mrs. Taylor were made\r\nvice-presidents; Mrs. Laura McCullough and Mrs. Amelia Dilliard,\r\nrecording secretaries; Mrs. Hildreth, corresponding secretary; and\r\nMrs. E. E. Greenleaf, treasurer. Mrs. Clopton represented the\r\nassociation at the Tennessee Centennial in 1898. Opposition is so\r\ngreat that it has been deemed wise to do nothing more than distribute\r\nliterature and present the arguments in the press.\r\n\r\nA State convention was held at Huntsville, Oct. 1, 1900, Mrs. Taylor\r\npresiding. Mrs. Clopton being obliged to resign, Miss Griffin was made\r\npresident. Mrs. Hume and Mrs. Robert Cunningham were chosen\r\nvice-presidents; Mrs. Greenleaf, treasurer; Miss Julia Tutweiler,\r\nState organizer.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In January, 1893, through the influence\r\nof the suffrage association, Senator J. W. Inzer presented a bill to\r\namend the State constitution so as to permit women to vote on\r\nmunicipal questions and prohibitory liquor enactments. It never was\r\nreported from the Judiciary Committee.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, at the desire of the New Decatur Club, Representative Osceola\r\nKyle introduced a bill raising the \"age of protection\" for girls from\r\nten to fourteen years, and a similar one was offered for the Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union. Although these efforts were not successful\r\nthen, public attention was drawn to the subject, and at the next\r\nsession, in 1897, the age was raised to fourteen years with a penalty\r\nof death or imprisonment for not less than ten years in the\r\npenitentiary.\r\n\r\nPrevious to 1886 legislation and public sentiment in Alabama were of\r\nthe most conservative kind, but at the Constitutional Convention held\r\nthat year changes in the statutes were made which gave to women many\r\nrights and privileges not before possessed. Dower but not curtesy\r\nobtains. If there are no lineal descendants, and the estate is\r\nsolvent, the widow takes one-half of the real estate for life, but if\r\nthe estate is insolvent, one-third only. If there are lineal\r\ndescendants, then the dower right is one-third, whether the estate is\r\nsolvent or not. If a husband die without a will, his widow, if there\r\nare no children, is entitled to all of his personal property; if\r\nthere is but one child, she is entitled to one-half; if there are more\r\nthan one and not more than four children, then she is entitled to one\r\nchild's portion. A homestead to the value of $2,000 is exempt to her\r\nfrom all creditors and no will can deprive her of it, unless she has\r\nsigned a mortgage on it. If a wife die without a will, her husband is\r\nentitled to one-half of her personal property, whether there are\r\nchildren or not, and to the life use of all her real estate.\r\n\r\nA wife may will her property to whom she pleases, excluding her\r\nhusband from all share. He can do this with his property, but can not\r\nimpair her dower rights. She can not sell her real estate without his\r\nwritten consent, but can sell her personal property without it. He can\r\nmortgage or sell his real estate, except the homestead, and can\r\ndispose of his personal property, without her consent.\r\n\r\nA married woman may be agent, guardian or administrator. She may\r\nacquire and hold separate property not liable for the debts of her\r\nhusband, though necessaries for the family can be a liability. Her\r\nbank deposit is her own, and her earnings can not be taken by her\r\nhusband or his creditors. A wife can not become surety for her\r\nhusband. Property purchased with her money will be returned to her\r\nupon application to the court.\r\n\r\nA wife may engage in business with her husband's written consent. If\r\nshe does so without it she incurs no penalty, but it is necessary in\r\norder that her creditors may recover their money. She must sue and be\r\nsued and make contracts jointly with the husband.\r\n\r\nIf a woman commit a crime in partnership with her husband (except\r\nmurder or treason) she can not be punished; nor, if she commit a crime\r\nin his presence, can he testify against her.\r\n\r\nCommon law marriage is valid and the legal age for a girl is fourteen\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe father is the guardian of the minor children, and at his death may\r\nappoint a guardian to the exclusion of the mother. If this is not done\r\nshe becomes the legal guardian of the girls till they are eighteen, of\r\nthe boys till fourteen.\r\n\r\nAlabama is one of the few States which do not by law require the\r\nhusband to support the family.\r\n\r\nThe convicted father of an illegitimate child must pay to the Probate\r\nCourt for its support not exceeding $50 yearly for ten years, and must\r\ngive $1,000 bond for this purpose. Failing to do this, judgment is\r\nrendered for not more than $625 and he is sentenced to hard labor for\r\nthe county for one year.\r\n\r\nIt is a criminal offense to use foul language to or in the hearing of\r\na woman, or by rude behavior to annoy her in any public place; or to\r\ntake a woman of notorious character to any public place of resort for\r\nrespectable women and men. Slander against a woman's character is\r\nheavily punished; a seducer is sent to the penitentiary if his victim\r\npreviously has been chaste. Procurers may be sentenced to the\r\npenitentiary.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection for girls\" is 14 years, and the penalty is\r\ndeath or imprisonment in the penitentiary from ten years to life.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women have no form of suffrage.[159]\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women are not eligible to any elective office. They\r\nact as enrolling clerks in the Legislature. Two women, whose fathers\r\ndied while holding the position, were made registrars in chancery.\r\nWomen can not serve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nThere are no women trustees on the board of any State institution,\r\nalthough the charitable and benevolent work is almost entirely in the\r\nhands of women. A man is superintendent of the Girls' Industrial\r\nSchool and the entire board is composed of men. Limited State aid is\r\nextended to a number of institutions founded and controlled by women,\r\nincluding the Boys' Industrial Farm.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: Women are legally prohibited from acting as lawyers,\r\nphysicians or ministers. They are not allowed to engage in mining.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All educational institutions admit women. The State\r\nPolytechnic at Auburn was the pioneer, offering to women in 1892 every\r\ncourse, technical, scientific and agricultural. The State University\r\nat Tuscaloosa opened its doors to them in 1896. Two scholarships for\r\ngirls are maintained here, one by the ladies of Montgomery and one by\r\nthose of Birmingham. In 1900, out of a class of 178 boys and 23\r\ngirls, two boys and four girls took the highest honors.\r\n\r\nThe State Industrial School for Girls, at Montevallo, was established\r\nin 1896. There are two co-educational Normal Schools at Florence and\r\nTroy.\r\n\r\nThe colored men and women have excellent advantages in several Normal\r\nSchools and Colleges. The Tuskegee Normal and Industrial Institute,\r\nunder the presidency of Booker T. Washington, has a national\r\nreputation. Colored children have also their full share of public\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nThere are in the public schools 2,262 men and 5,041 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $32; of the women, $25.35.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe most progressive movement in the State is that of the Federation\r\nof Women's Clubs, formed in 1895, and including at present fifty-eight\r\nclubs. Its work has been extremely practical in the line of education\r\nand philanthropy. The most important achievement is the Boys'\r\nIndustrial Farm, located at East Lake near Birmingham. This is managed\r\nby a board of women and has a charter which secures its control to\r\nwomen, even if it become entirely a State institution. The club women\r\nhave for three years sustained five scholarships for girls, two at\r\nTuscaloosa and three at Montevallo. They have organized also a free\r\ntraveling library, and in four cities free kindergartens.\r\n\r\nIn conclusion it may be noted that the strength of the woman movement\r\nin the State has been wonderfully developed in all directions during\r\nthe last five years.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[158] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Ellen Stephens\r\nHildreth of New Decatur, the first president of the State Woman\r\nSuffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[159] In the Constitutional Convention of 1901, an amendment providing\r\nthat any woman paying taxes on $500 worth of property might vote on\r\nall bond propositions was adopted with great enthusiasm, but the next\r\nday, under the influence of the argument that \"it would be an entering\r\nwedge for full suffrage,\" it was reconsidered and voted down. U. S.\r\nSenator John T. Morgan urged this amendment. The new constitution did\r\ncontain a clause, however, providing that if a wife paid taxes on $500\r\nworth of property her husband should be entitled to this vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVI.\r\n\r\nARIZONA.[160]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Territory having elected delegates to a convention to be held in\r\nPhoenix in August and September, 1891, to prepare a constitution for\r\nStatehood, Henry B. Blackwell and Lucy Stone of Massachusetts sent\r\nMrs. Laura M. Johns of Kansas to Arizona in August to endeavor to\r\nsecure a clause in this constitution granting suffrage to women. She\r\nwas received in Tucson by Mr. and Mrs. Hughes, editors and proprietors\r\nof an influential daily paper, who gave every possible assistance.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns soon went to Phoenix, where the convention was in session,\r\nand followed up a previous correspondence with the delegates\r\nby personal interviews. She found a powerful champion in\r\nex-Attorney-General William Herring, chairman of the committee which\r\nhad the question of woman suffrage in charge. When she asked\r\npermission to address this committee it set an early date and\r\nsuggested that it might be pleasanter for the ladies if the hearing\r\nshould be held in a private residence. Accordingly Mrs. E. D. Garlick,\r\nformerly of Winfield, Kansas, opened her parlor, invited a number of\r\nladies who were interested and the committee met with them and\r\nlistened courteously to their plea for the ballot. A favorable report\r\nwas presented to the convention and General Herring, Mrs. Johns, Mrs.\r\nHughes and others spoke eloquently in favor of its acceptance. The\r\nmeasure was lost by three votes.\r\n\r\nSo much interest had been manifested that a Territorial Suffrage\r\nAssociation was formed, with Mrs. Hughes as president and Mrs. Garlick\r\nas corresponding secretary. Mrs. Johns intended to organize the\r\nTerritory but was suddenly called home by a death in her family.\r\n\r\nFour years later, in 1895, while she was working in New Mexico for the\r\nNational Association, she was requested by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\nchairman of its organization committee, to speak at the annual\r\nconvention in Phoenix; and on the way she held preliminary meetings at\r\nTucson, Tempe and other places.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1896, Mrs. Hughes, whose husband was now Governor, went to\r\nthe convention of the National Association in Washington to interest\r\nthat body in Arizona, which it was then expected would soon enter\r\nStatehood. She made a strong appeal, assuring the delegates that the\r\npioneer men of the Territory were willing to confer the suffrage on\r\nthe women who had braved the early hardships with them, and saying:\r\n\r\n     It is of the most vital importance that our women be enfranchised\r\n     before the election of delegates to the approaching\r\n     constitutional convention, as the Congressional enabling act\r\n     provides that all persons qualified as voters under the\r\n     Territorial law shall be qualified to vote for delegates to this\r\n     convention and for the ratification or rejection of the same.\r\n\r\n     If our women are enfranchised before the enabling act is passed,\r\n     then Arizona is safe and no power can prevent them from being\r\n     accorded their rights in the constitution, and if their rights\r\n     are not conceded they will see to it that the constitution fails\r\n     of ratification.\r\n\r\nIn March the National Association sent Mrs. Johns again into the\r\nTerritory and she remained until May. In company with Mrs. Hughes she\r\nmade a successful tour through the Salt River Valley, receiving\r\ngenerous hospitality, addressing large audiences and forming local\r\nclubs. The two ladies then crossed the Territory to Yuma, speaking at\r\nvarious points on the way, and went from there to Prescott. Governor\r\nHughes himself spoke at the meetings held in Clifton. Mrs. Johns then\r\nwent to the Northern counties. Altogether most of the towns were\r\nvisited, and while the distances were great and the difficulties\r\nnumerous, the meetings were well attended and earnest advocates were\r\nfound even in small mining camps among the mountains.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns returned in the winter of 1897 and addressed the\r\nLegislature in behalf of a bill for woman suffrage but no action was\r\ntaken. Among the friends and workers not elsewhere mentioned were the\r\nHon. and Mrs. George P. Blair, ex-Mayor Gustavus Hoff, C. R. Drake,\r\nJohn T. Hughes; the other officers of the suffrage association were\r\nMrs. C. T. Hayden, vice-president; Mrs. R. G. Phillips, corresponding\r\nsecretary; Mrs. Lillian Collins, recording secretary; Mrs. Mary E.\r\nHall, treasurer.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1899 the time seemed propitious for a vigorous\r\nmovement, and Mrs. Chapman Catt and Miss Mary G. Hay spent a month at\r\nPhoenix during the legislative session. Every possible effort was\r\nmade, there seemed to be a remarkable sentiment in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage among the better classes and it looked as if it would be\r\ngranted. The final result is thus described in Mrs. Chapman Catt's\r\nreport to the national convention the following April:\r\n\r\n     Our bill went through the House by an unprecedented majority, 10\r\n     yeas, 5 nays, and then, as in Oklahoma, the remonstrants\r\n     concentrated their opposition upon the Council. Here, as there,\r\n     the working opponents were the saloon-keepers, with the\r\n     difference that in Arizona they are often the proprietors of a\r\n     gambling den and house of prostitution in connection with the\r\n     saloons, and thus the opposition was more bitter and intolerant\r\n     because it was believed greater damage would result from the\r\n     votes of women. Every member of the Council received letters or\r\n     telegrams from the leading proprietors of such resorts,\r\n     threatening political ruin if he failed to vote against the\r\n     measure. It was well known that money was contributed from these\r\n     same sources. Here, as in Oklahoma, a majority were pledged to\r\n     support the bill, but here, too, they played a filibustering game\r\n     which prevented its coming to final vote. Pledges made to women\r\n     are not usually counted as binding, but these pledges, as in\r\n     Oklahoma, were made to men who were political co-workers. They\r\n     did not deem it prudent to break these pledges by an open vote\r\n     against the bill, but they held that they were not violated when\r\n     they kept the matter from coming to a vote. The opposition was\r\n     led by the proprietor of the largest and richest saloon in the\r\n     Territory.\r\n\r\n     I have never found anywhere, however, so many strong, determined,\r\n     able men, anxious to espouse our cause as in Arizona. The general\r\n     sentiment is overwhelmingly in our favor. At one time three\r\n     prominent men were in Phoenix to do what they could for the\r\n     suffrage bill, each of whom had traveled four hundred miles for\r\n     this express purpose. Governor N. O. Murphy recommended woman\r\n     suffrage in his message and did all that was possible to assist\r\n     its passage. The press is favorable, the intelligent and moral\r\n     citizens are eager for it, but the vicious elements, as\r\n     everywhere, are opposed. For a month the question was bitterly\r\n     contested, but its foes prevented a vote. So again a campaign,\r\n     which was sure of victory had each man voted his conviction,\r\n     ended in crime and bribery won the day. The pay of legislators in\r\n     the Territories is very small, and the most desirable men can not\r\n     afford to serve. In consequence there drifts into every\r\n     Legislature enough men of unprincipled character to make a\r\n     balance of power. It may interest you to know that in both\r\n     Territories we were told that all such legislation is controlled\r\n     by bribery, and that our measure could be put through in a\r\n     twinkling by \"a little money judiciously distributed,\" but to\r\n     such suggestions we replied that what the suffragists had won\r\n     they had won honestly and we would postpone further advances till\r\n     they could come in the same way. In the future years of strife\r\n     over this question there will be many hands stained with guilt,\r\n     but they will be those of the remonstrants and not ours. Though\r\n     crime prevented the victory, yet we were abundantly assured of\r\n     the lasting results of the campaign.\r\n\r\nLAWS: Curtesy and dower were abolished by Territorial legislation, but\r\nin 1887 Congress passed an act granting a widow dower in all the\r\nTerritories. If either husband or wife die without a will, leaving\r\ndescendants, out of the separate property of either the survivor has\r\none-third of the personal and a life use of one-third of the real\r\nestate. If there are no descendants, the survivor has all of the\r\npersonal and a life use of one-half the real estate; if there are\r\nneither descendants nor father nor mother of the decedent, the\r\nsurvivor has the whole estate. The community property goes entirely to\r\nthe survivor if there are no descendants, otherwise one-half goes to\r\nthe survivor, in either case charged with the community debts. If the\r\nwidow has a maintenance derived from her own property equal to $2,000,\r\nthe whole property so set apart, other than her half of the homestead,\r\nmust go to the minor children. If the homestead was selected from the\r\ncommunity property it vests absolutely in the survivor. If selected\r\nfrom the separate property of either, it vests in that one or his\r\nheirs. It can not exceed $5,000 in value.\r\n\r\nMarried women have the exclusive control of their separate property;\r\nit is not liable for the debts or obligations of the husband; it may\r\nbe mortgaged, sold or disposed of by will without his consent. The\r\nsame privileges are extended to husbands.\r\n\r\nA married woman may sue and be sued and make contracts in her own name\r\nas regards her separate property, but she must sue jointly with her\r\nhusband for personal injuries, and damages recovered are community\r\nproperty and in his control.\r\n\r\nIf a married woman desire to become a sole trader she must file a\r\ncertificate in the registry of deeds setting forth the nature and\r\nplace of business. She can not become a sole trader if the original\r\ncapital invested exceeds $10,000 unless she takes oath that the\r\nsurplus did not come from any funds of the husband. If the wife is not\r\na sole trader her wages are community property and belong to the\r\nhusband while she is living with him.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the minor children. At his death\r\nthe mother becomes guardian so long as she remains unmarried, provided\r\nshe is a suitable person.\r\n\r\nIf the husband fails to support his wife, she may contract debts for\r\nnecessaries on his credit, and for such debts she and her husband must\r\nbe sued jointly and if he is not financially responsible her separate\r\nproperty may be taken.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 14 years in\r\n1887, and to 18 in 1895. The penalty is confinement in the\r\npenitentiary for life or for not less than five years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Since 1887 every person, male or female, twenty-one years\r\nold, who is the parent or guardian of a child of school age residing\r\nin the district, or has paid Territorial or county school tax,\r\nexclusive of poll-tax, during the preceding year, is eligible to the\r\noffice of school trustee and entitled to vote for this officer at any\r\nSchool District election. This includes all cities and towns in the\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women may legally serve as school trustees, court\r\ncommissioners, clerks of court, official stenographers, deputies and\r\nclerks in Territorial, county and municipal offices, and notaries\r\npublic. Very few, however, are filling any of these offices.\r\n\r\nGovernor L. C. Hughes held that women were qualified to sit on any\r\nState Board and appointed one on the board of the State Normal School\r\nand one assistant superintendent of the Insane Asylum. None have since\r\nbeen appointed. There are no women physicians in any public\r\ninstitutions, and no police matrons at any jail or station-house.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The State University is co-educational. In the public\r\nschools there are 122 men and 257 women teachers. The average monthly\r\nsalary of the men is $73.23; of the women, $63.17.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[160] The History is indebted to Mrs. L. C. Hughes of Tucson, former\r\npresident of the Territorial Woman Suffrage Association, and to Mrs.\r\nLaura M. Johns of Kansas for material used in this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVII.\r\n\r\nARKANSAS.[161]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the first woman suffrage association in Arkansas was formed at\r\nEureka Springs by Miss Phoebe W. Couzins and Mrs. Lizzie D. Fyler, who\r\nwas made president. Miss Susan B. Anthony lectured in February, 1889,\r\nin Helena, Fort Smith and Little Rock, at the last place introduced by\r\nGov. James B. Eagle. On Sunday afternoon she spoke at a temperance\r\nmeeting in this city, to a large audience that manifested every\r\nevidence of approval although she advocated woman suffrage. These were\r\nthe first addresses on woman's enfranchisement given in the State.\r\n\r\nNo regularly constituted State suffrage convention ever has been held,\r\nbut at the close of the annual Woman's Christian Temperance Union\r\nconvention it is customary for the members of this body who favor the\r\nballot for woman to meet and elect the usual officers for that branch\r\nof the work.\r\n\r\nFor fifteen years before her death in 1899, Mrs. Clara A. McDiarmid\r\nwas a leader, was president of the association and represented the\r\nState at the national conventions. Dr. Ida J. Brooks is an earnest\r\nworker, and valuable assistance has been given by Mrs. Fannie L. Chunn\r\nand Mrs. Bernie Babcock.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Mrs. Lida A. Meriwether of Tennessee gave twelve lectures\r\nunder the auspices of the National Association. Miss Frances A.\r\nGriffin of Alabama also spoke here on this subject.\r\n\r\nNot even this brief history of the suffrage movement would be complete\r\nwithout a mention of the _Woman's Chronicle_, established in 1888 by\r\nCatherine Campbell Cunningham, Mary Burt Brooks and Haryot Holt\r\nCahoon. Mrs. Brooks was principal of the Forest Grove School, and Miss\r\nCunningham a teacher in the public schools of Little Rock, but every\r\nweek for five years this bright, newsy paper appeared on time. It was\r\ndevoted to the general interests of women, with a strong advocacy of\r\ntheir enfranchisement. During the General Assembly it was laid each\r\nSaturday morning on the desk of every legislator. Charles E.\r\nCunningham encouraged and sustained his daughter in her work.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: The only bill for woman suffrage was that\r\nchampioned in the Senate by J. P. H. Russ, in 1891, \"An act to give\r\nwhite women the right to vote and hold office, and all other rights\r\nthe same as are accorded to male citizens.\" This unconstitutional\r\nmeasure passed third reading, but it is not surprising that it\r\nreceived only four affirmative votes; fourteen voted against it and\r\nfourteen refrained from voting.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 the law recognizing insanity after marriage as a ground for\r\ndivorce was repealed.\r\n\r\nThis year a law was passed requiring the councils of all first-class\r\ncities to elect a police matron to look after woman prisoners.\r\n\r\nDower exists but not curtesy, unless the wife dies intestate and there\r\nhas been issue born alive. If there are children the wife is entitled\r\nto one-third of the real property for her life and one-third of the\r\npersonal property absolutely. If there are no children living she\r\ntakes in fee simple one-half of the real estate where it is a new\r\nacquisition and not an inheritance, and one-half of the personal\r\nestate absolutely as against the collateral heirs; but as against\r\ncreditors she takes one-third of the real estate in fee simple and\r\none-third of the personal property absolutely. If either the husband\r\nor the wife die without a will and there are neither father, mother,\r\nnor their descendants, nor any paternal or maternal kindred capable of\r\ninheriting, the whole estate, both real and personal, goes to the\r\nsurviving wife or husband.\r\n\r\nThe wife may sell or transfer her separate real estate without the\r\nconsent of the husband. He can do the same with his real estate but\r\ncan not impair her dower. A transfer of the homestead requires the\r\njoint signature.\r\n\r\nA married woman as sole trader may engage in business on her own\r\naccount and have the profits free from the interference of her\r\nhusband, but if she is simply working for wages he may sue for her\r\nearnings and his receipt will bind her.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the children, having custody of\r\ntheir persons and property, but \"no man shall bind his child to\r\napprenticeship or service, or part with the control of such child, or\r\ncreate any testamentary guardianship therefor, unless the mother\r\nshall in writing signify her consent thereto.\" At the father's death\r\nthe mother may be guardian of the persons of the children but not of\r\ntheir property unless derived from her.\r\n\r\nThere is no law requiring the husband to support his family.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 12 to 16 years in\r\n1893, with a penalty of imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than\r\nfive years nor more than twenty-one. In 1899 the minimum penalty was\r\nreduced to one year.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women have no form of suffrage except under the Three-Mile\r\nLaw. This provides that, on petition of a majority of the inhabitants\r\nliving within three miles of any church or school, the court shall\r\nmake it illegal for liquor to be sold within this limit for two years.\r\nThe law never has been utilized in the larger cities, but has been\r\ntried in numerous small towns and hundreds of outlying districts,\r\nwhere it has borne the test bravely, ruling out completely the public\r\ndrink-houses. Wherever it has been put into force, women have been a\r\nstrong factor, giving their own signatures in its favor and in many\r\ninstances making house to house canvasses to obtain signers.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women are not eligible for any elective office. For\r\ntwenty-five years, however, they have held clerkships in both branches\r\nof the General Assembly. In 1899 a bill to disqualify them from\r\nholding these was defeated in the Lower House by a considerable\r\nmajority. But this same Legislature did not hesitate to declare women\r\nnot qualified to serve as notaries public, which they had been doing\r\nfor several years.\r\n\r\nThere are police matrons in Little Rock and Hot Springs.\r\n\r\nFor one year the \"visiting committee\" appointed by the School Board\r\nwas composed of three men and two women. The latter made a written\r\nreport, but the innovation was not repeated.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: Women are not permitted to practice law. No other\r\nprofession or occupation is legally forbidden.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All of the universities and colleges are coeducational,\r\neven the Law and Medical Departments of the State University being\r\nopen to women.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 4,515 men and 2,558 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $49.22, of the women,\r\n$35.52.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[161] The History is indebted for the material for this chapter to\r\nMiss Catherine Campbell Cunningham of Little Rock, one of the earliest\r\nsuffrage workers in the State.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXVIII.\r\n\r\nCALIFORNIA.[162]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first woman suffrage meeting on the Pacific Coast was held in San\r\nFrancisco in May, 1869, and a State association was formed in January,\r\n1870. From that date meetings were held regularly and a committee of\r\nwomen did faithful work at the Legislature every session, securing\r\nmany changes in the laws to the advantage of women.[163]\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting of the association in San Francisco in December,\r\n1884, Mrs. Laura De Force Gordon succeeded Mrs. Clara S. Foltz as\r\npresident and held the office for the next ten years. During this time\r\nshe attended a number of national suffrage conventions in Washington\r\nand delivered addresses in many parts of the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the political campaign of 1888 Mrs. Gordon and Mrs. Foltz were\r\nemployed as speakers by the Democratic Central Committee, and Miss\r\nAddie L. Ballou by the Republican. The Populist and the Labor parties\r\nselected women as delegates to their State conventions and placed them\r\non their tickets for various offices. Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake of\r\nNew York and Mrs. Marilla M. Ricker of New Hampshire visited the\r\nPacific Coast and gave very acceptable lectures to the suffrage\r\nsocieties.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Mrs. Ellen Clark Sargent and Mrs. Sarah Knox Goodrich each\r\nsubscribed $100 to send Mrs. Gordon to Washington Territory to aid the\r\nwomen there in securing the adoption of a suffrage amendment to the\r\nState constitution. She canvassed the State, contributing her\r\nservices. The next year, through the efforts of these two ladies and\r\ntheir own contributions, over $1,000 were sent to South Dakota to\r\nassist the women in a similar attempt.\r\n\r\nSuffrage meetings for various purposes were held in 1890, the largest\r\nbeing a grand rally at Metropolitan Temple, July 4, to celebrate the\r\nadmission of Wyoming as a State with full suffrage for women, at which\r\nthere were addresses by the Hon. T. V. Cator, the Rev. C. W. Wendte,\r\nJames K. Barry, the Hon. P. Reddy, the Hon. Charles Summer, Mrs.\r\nGordon and others. This year the State Grange and the Farmers'\r\nAlliance cordially indorsed woman suffrage at their conventions. The\r\nannual suffrage meeting was held in Washington Hall, San Francisco,\r\nSeptember 26. Mrs. Gordon was appointed a committee to select her own\r\nassistants and have full charge of the legislative work during the\r\nwinter.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 practically every organization of either men or women seemed\r\nto be permeated with the agitation for woman suffrage. Among the most\r\neffective speakers and writers were Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Stetson,\r\nMrs. Sarah B. Cooper, Miss Agnes Manning, Miss Ina D. Coolbrith, Mme.\r\nA. L. Sorbier, Mrs. E. O. Smith and Mrs. Sara A. T. Lemmon.[164]\r\n\r\nMany informal business meetings were held during the next two years in\r\nMrs. Gordon's law office. The adoption of equal suffrage by Colorado\r\nin 1893 inspired the California women to renewed effort. An Equal\r\nRights League was formed of experienced suffrage workers. This was\r\nfollowed by the Young Woman's Suffrage Club, Miss Fannie Lemme,\r\npresident, which became very popular. The Political Equality Club of\r\nAlameda County was organized in April. The Portia Law Club, Mrs.\r\nFoltz, dean, occupied a prominent place. The Woman's Federation also\r\nwas an active society.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the Trans-Mississippi Congress met in San Francisco with five\r\nregularly accredited women delegates in attendance. A woman suffrage\r\nresolution was presented for their indorsement and eloquently\r\nadvocated by Mrs. Mary Lynde Craig. It was bitterly contested but\r\nfinally passed by 251 yeas, 211 nays, amidst cheers and the waving of\r\nhats.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 was held the great Midwinter Fair, and the Woman's Congress\r\nAuxiliary became an intellectual focus for gifted women. It culminated\r\nin the brilliant convocation which was in session in Golden Gate Hall,\r\nSan Francisco, for a week in May. Its promoters were Mrs. John Vance\r\nCheney, Mrs. Horace Davis, Mrs. Cooper, Miss Hattie Cooper, Mrs. Mary\r\nS. Sperry, Mrs. Lovell White, Mrs. William A. Keith, Mrs. Tupper\r\nWilkes, Mrs. Alice Moore McComas, Mrs. Gordon and others. Mrs. Irving\r\nM. Scott, president of Sorosis, received the Congress socially in her\r\nelegant home. A large reception was given also at the magnificent\r\ncountry residence of Mrs. Frank M. Smith in East Oakland.\r\n\r\nThe Congress was followed by a mass meeting under the auspices of the\r\nsuffrage societies. The hall would scarcely hold the audiences, which\r\nwere especially distinguished by the large number of men, and noted\r\nmen were also among the speakers. The venerable Alfred Cridge of the\r\nSingle Tax League created much interest by a practical illustration of\r\nproportional representation, the candidates for president and\r\nvice-president being Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B. Anthony, the\r\nwomen doing the voting. Letters of regret at inability to be present\r\nbut expressing sympathy with the object of the meeting were received\r\nfrom Gov. James H. Budd, President David Starr Jordan of Leland\r\nStanford University, U. S. Senator Perkins, Supreme Judge McFarland,\r\nJudge James G. Maguire and others.\r\n\r\nThis year the State Association elected as its president Mrs. Nellie\r\nHolbrook Blinn, who had been an ardent worker in the cause for a\r\nnumber of years and a prominent speaker for the Republican party. Mrs.\r\nAnnie K. Bidwell was made vice-president; Mrs. Hester A. Harland,\r\nrecording secretary; Mrs. Emily Pitt Stevens, corresponding secretary;\r\nMrs. Emma Gregory, treasurer. Meetings were held every fortnight in\r\nSt. George's Hall. In a short time General Warfield, proprietor of the\r\nCalifornia Hotel, offered the society the use of its parlors, which\r\nwas gladly accepted.\r\n\r\nIn August a reception was given in honor of the National Press\r\nAssociation, then holding a convention in San Francisco, at which\r\naddresses were made by Mayor Adolph Sutro, the Hon. Samuel Shortridge\r\nand others. During the autumn a number of large and enthusiastic\r\nmeetings were held.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1895, Miss Susan B. Anthony and the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\npresident and vice-president of the National Association, arrived in\r\nSan Francisco in response to a cordial invitation to assist in the\r\nWoman's Congress which opened on the 20th. No meetings ever held were\r\nmore beautiful and inspiring than these, presided over by Mrs.\r\nCooper.[165] The best speakers in the State, men and women,\r\nparticipated and every possible honor, public and social, was\r\nconferred upon the two Eastern guests.\r\n\r\nAfter the congress they accepted invitations to speak in San Jose, Los\r\nAngeles, Pasadena, Riverside, Pomona and San Diego. The audiences\r\neverywhere were large and cordial and their pathway was literally\r\nstrewn with flowers. They returned to San Francisco and again\r\naddressed great audiences in that city and Oakland. Miss Shaw accepted\r\nthe invitation of the executive committee to be one of the orators at\r\nthe Fourth of July celebration in Woodward's Pavilion.\r\n\r\nOn July 2, 3, these ladies met with the State Suffrage Convention in\r\nGolden Gate Hall. Under their wise counsel a board of officers was\r\nelected which proved acceptable to all the members of the\r\nassociation,[166] and a constitution was adopted which eliminated the\r\ncauses of past contentions.\r\n\r\nThe State was now thoroughly aroused over the submission by the\r\nLegislature the preceding winter of an amendment conferring Full\r\nSuffrage on women, which was to be voted on the next year. Auxiliary\r\nsocieties were reported from Oakland, San Jose, Stockton, Los Angeles,\r\nFresno and other places and 300 new members were enrolled. The big\r\nhall was crowded at the evening meetings and addresses were made by\r\nMrs. Sargent, the new president, Miss Anthony, Miss Shaw, Mrs. Cooper,\r\nMrs. Craig, Mrs. Blinn and others.\r\n\r\nThe officers elected at this time continued through all the long and\r\ntrying campaign of 1896, which is described further on. The amendment\r\nwas defeated at the election of November 3. The State convention was\r\ncalled for November 5, 6, in order that the Eastern women might be\r\npresent, as they were to leave on the 7th. A magnificent farewell\r\nmeeting was held on the first evening in Metropolitan Temple, which\r\nwas crowded from pit to dome. The _Call_ declared, \"It was more like\r\nthe ratification of a victory than a rally after defeat;\" and at the\r\nclose of the convention said: \"It furnished during its entire sessions\r\nan example of pluck and patience such as should forever quiet the\r\ncalumny that women do not know how to govern themselves--that they\r\nbecome hysterical in the face of defeat.\"\r\n\r\nThe committee[167] reported a set of strong, courageous resolutions\r\nwhich were adopted with cheers. The last one declared: \"While we\r\naccept the verdict of the election we do not regard it as final, but\r\nbelieving that our cause is just and must prevail, we will enter at\r\nonce on a vigorous campaign which will end only when the ballot is\r\nplaced in the hands of California women.\"\r\n\r\nA systematic plan of work was adopted and, as Mrs. Sargent was about\r\nto leave for a year abroad, Mrs. Mary Wood Swift was elected\r\npresident. Mrs. Goodrich and Mrs. Sargent were made honorary\r\npresidents. Twelve hundred dollars were raised to pay all outstanding\r\ncampaign debts, and the convention closed with a good-bye reception to\r\nMiss Anthony, Miss Shaw, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt and the other ladies\r\nfrom the East.\r\n\r\nThe annual State meeting of 1897 was held in San Francisco, October 5,\r\n6, with able addresses by the Rev. E. S. Chapman, Albert H. Elliott, a\r\nSan Francisco attorney, Doctors Beecher and Bushnell, representing the\r\nwomen in their profession, Mrs. E. O. Smith and many others. Mrs.\r\nSwift was re-elected president and continued to serve until 1900.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1898 also was held in San Francisco, October 4-6,\r\nand was made a jubilee meeting to celebrate the calling of the First\r\nWoman's Rights Convention in 1848.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the annual State meeting, held in San Francisco November 7, 8,\r\nwas greatly stimulated by the presence of Mrs. Chapman Catt, chairman\r\nof the national organization committee, and Miss Mary G. Hay, its\r\nsecretary. Active societies were reported in many counties and a large\r\namount of work done by the press committee of fourteen members, Mrs.\r\nMary L. Wakeman Curtis, chairman. It was announced that the Susan B.\r\nAnthony Club would hold a public meeting in the audience room of the\r\nCentury Club, February 15, to celebrate that lady's eightieth\r\nbirthday, at which President Jordan and Albert H. Elliott would be the\r\norators. Addresses were given by Miss Sarah Severance, Mrs. Julia S.\r\nSanborn, Mrs. Mary McHenry (Wm. A.) Keith, Mrs. Smith, Miss Selina\r\nSolomons and Miss Clara M. Schlingheyde.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of November 9 the convention was transferred to Oakland\r\nand every seat in the large Unitarian church was filled. Mrs. Chapman\r\nCatt was the speaker, introduced by the Rev. J. K. McLean. Mrs.\r\nBaldwin, president of the Alameda County society, Mrs. Swift and other\r\nprominent women occupied the beautifully decorated platform. During\r\nthe afternoon a reception had been given in the artistic home of Mrs.\r\nEmma Shafter Howard.\r\n\r\nThe convention for 1900 was held in San Francisco as usual, December\r\n14, 15. Mrs. Annie R. Wood was elected president.[168]\r\n\r\nOne of the largest auxiliary societies is that of Alameda County with\r\na dozen branches. The presidents have been the Rev. J. K. McLean, Mrs.\r\nM. S. Haight, Mrs. Alice M. Stocker, Mrs. Isabel A. Baldwin, Mrs. H.\r\nJ. D. Chapman and Mrs. Frances A. Williamson.[169]\r\n\r\nThe San Jose Club was formed for campaign work, Nov. 14, 1895, with\r\nfifty-four charter members. It has continued to hold weekly meetings\r\nunder the presidency of Dr. Alida C. Avery.[170] There are a number of\r\nother efficient clubs in Northern California.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: As early as 1868, and for many years afterwards,\r\nMrs. Laura De Force Gordon addressed the Legislature in behalf of\r\npolitical rights for women, and from then until the present time there\r\nhave been few sessions which have not had the question brought before\r\nthem. A large number of legislators, lawyers and leading women have\r\ncontended that the constitution of the State is so worded that it is\r\nwithin the power of the Legislature to confer the full franchise by\r\nstatute, but bills for this purpose always have been defeated by a\r\nmajority who hold that this can be done legally only by an amendment\r\nto the constitution adopted by the electors. Mrs. Nellie Holbrook\r\nBlinn has spent many winters at Sacramento in the interest of suffrage\r\nbills, and Mrs. Clara S. Foltz has frequently made legal arguments\r\nbefore joint committees. Beginning with 1891 Mrs. Sturtevant Peet,\r\npresident of the State Woman's Christian Temperance Union, has\r\nremained through every legislative session representing that\r\norganization, with bills for temperance measures, suffrage and other\r\nmatters of especial interest to women. During all of these years the\r\nsuffrage bills before the Legislature have been reinforced by great\r\npetitions and hundreds of personal letters from the women of Southern\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Miss Sarah M. Severance, State Superintendent of Franchise for\r\nthe W. C. T. U., went to Sacramento with a large petition asking for\r\nSchool Suffrage. Mrs. Gordon, a practicing lawyer, already had\r\nprepared three bills asking for Municipal and School Suffrage\r\nincluding the right to hold every educational office. All were\r\nreported favorably from the Senate committee. The first was passed,\r\nreconsidered and although again receiving a majority vote, had not the\r\nconstitutional two-thirds. The School Suffrage Bill passed by 24 ayes,\r\n7 noes. In the Assembly it received 36 ayes, 22 noes, not the required\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 a bill was presented to enfranchise women by statute. It was\r\nchampioned by Senators McGowan, Dargie and Simpson of the northern,\r\nand Carpenter and McComas of the southern part of the State. On\r\nFebruary 7 a hearing was granted by the Judiciary Committee, and Mrs.\r\nGordon gave a strong legal argument which was presented to the members\r\nas a \"brief;\" and addresses were made by Miss Severance, Mrs. Addie\r\nL. Ballou and Mrs. Emily Pitt Stevens. Before the vote was taken in\r\nthe Legislature Mrs. Sturtevant Peet presented the great petition of\r\nthe W. C. T. U. containing 15,000 names, and many were offered by\r\nsenators from various counties. Individual appeals were sent by Mrs.\r\nEllen Clark Sargent, Mrs. Sarah Knox Goodrich, Dr. Alida C. Avery,\r\nMrs. E. O. Smith and many other well-known women. The bill passed the\r\nSenate by 21 ayes, 17 noes. It had been delayed so long, however, that\r\nit was too late to reach the Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the State Republican Convention adopted a plank as follows:\r\n\"Believing that taxation without representation is against the\r\nprinciples of the Government we favor the extension of the right of\r\nsuffrage to all citizens of the United States, both men and women.\"\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of 1895 was strongly Republican and the time seemed to\r\nbe highly propitious for securing woman suffrage. To this end a number\r\nof influential women visited Sacramento. The first bill presented\r\ncalled for enfranchisement by special statute and was introduced and\r\nchampioned in the Assembly by Judge E. V. Spencer. On the afternoon of\r\nJanuary 24 Mrs. Blinn and Mrs. Foltz addressed the Senate Judiciary\r\nCommittee, and in the evening a mass meeting took place in the Court\r\nHouse, which the Judiciary and Elections Committees of the Senate and\r\nHouse attended in a body, as did also a large number of the members.\r\nMrs. Gordon made the leading address and Mrs. Foltz the closing\r\nspeech. Another meeting, held in the Assembly Chamber February 8, was\r\naddressed by Mrs. E. V. Spencer, Mrs. Blinn, Miss Laura Tilden, a\r\nlawyer, Mrs. Gordon and Mrs. Peet. Great assistance also was rendered\r\nby Mrs. Annie K. Bidwell, Mme. A. L. Sorbier, Dr. Lillian Lomax and\r\nMrs. Jennie Phelps Purvis.\r\n\r\nThe bill came to a vote in the Assembly February 11 and passed. A\r\ndefect was then discovered in the title and it was voted on again\r\nFebruary 19, receiving 46 ayes, 29 noes. In the Senate it met with\r\nmany vicissitudes which need not be recounted, as it eventually failed\r\nto pass. This was largely because the members did not believe it would\r\nbe constitutional.\r\n\r\nThis question being settled, Senators McGowan of Eureka, and Bulla of\r\nLos Angeles, Assemblyman Spencer of Lassen, and others championed a\r\nresolution to amend the constitution by striking out the word \"male\"\r\nfrom the suffrage clause. This was adopted in March, 1895, by a\r\ntwo-thirds majority of both Houses, and signed by Gov. James H. Budd.\r\nThe story of the campaign which was made to secure the adoption of\r\nthis amendment is related hereafter. It was defeated by the voters.\r\n\r\nAlthough the experienced national officers told the California women\r\nthat it would be many years before they would be able to secure\r\nanother bill they did not believe it, but went to the Legislature of\r\n1897 full of hope that an amendment would be submitted again and they\r\ncould make another campaign while their organizations were intact and\r\npublic sentiment aroused. Mrs. Mary Wood Swift, Mrs. Mary S. Sperry\r\nand Mme. A. L. Sorbier spent much of the winter in Sacramento, and\r\nenough members were pledged to pass the bill. When it was acted upon,\r\nhowever, while it received a majority in both Houses, it lacked seven\r\nvotes in the Assembly and one in the Senate of the necessary\r\ntwo-thirds.[171]\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Representative W. S. Mellick of Los Angeles introduced a bill\r\ngiving women the right to vote for school trustees, and at elections\r\nfor school bonds or tax levy. It passed the Assembly with only one\r\ndissenting vote, and the Senate by a majority of six. Gov. Henry T.\r\nGage refused to sign it on the old ground of unconstitutionality.\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT CAMPAIGN: The action of the Legislature of\r\n1895 in submitting an amendment to the voters, instead of conferring\r\nthe franchise by statute, was somewhat of a disappointment to the\r\nwomen as it precipitated a campaign which would come at the same time\r\nas that for President of the United States, and for which there was\r\nnot sufficient organization. They were very much at sea for a while\r\nbut in the spring of 1895 Miss Susan B. Anthony and the Rev. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw, president and vice-president of the National Association,\r\ncame to California to the Woman's Congress, and while here, having\r\nhad much experience, helped them plan their work and gave every\r\npossible encouragement. In the autumn Miss Shaw returned and held\r\nmeetings throughout the State, managed by Miss Harriet Cooper. The\r\nnext year, at the urgent request of the State Association, Miss\r\nAnthony and Miss Shaw came back and remained from the first of March\r\nuntil after the election in November, rendering all the assistance\r\nwithin their power in the longest and hardest campaign ever made for a\r\nwoman suffrage amendment. An amendment committee had been appointed at\r\nthe last annual convention and out of this and the State officers a\r\nCampaign Committee[172] was formed and, in addition, a State Central\r\nCommittee was organized.\r\n\r\nMrs. Sargent opened her handsome home for headquarters the first three\r\nmonths, and for eight months she and her daughter, Dr. Elizabeth C.\r\nSargent, gave every hour to this work, entertaining as guests Miss\r\nAnthony, Miss Shaw and other workers and contributing large sums of\r\nmoney. In February, Dr. Sargent and Miss Shaw's secretary, Lucy E.\r\nAnthony, arranged a series of two days' conventions in every county in\r\nthe State. Miss Harriet May Mills and Miss Mary G. Hay of New York,\r\nexperienced organizers, were invited to California to manage these\r\nconventions and remained throughout the campaign.[173] The Rev. Miss\r\nShaw and Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates of Maine were the speakers. The\r\naudiences were large and cordial, clubs were formed and the meetings\r\nmore than paid expenses.\r\n\r\nOn Sunday, May 3, the San Francisco _Call_, the leading Republican\r\npaper, under the management of Charles M. Shortridge, came out with\r\nflaming headlines declaring for woman suffrage, and several hundred\r\ncopies were sent to the State Republican convention which met in\r\nSacramento the following Tuesday. A number of prominent women went to\r\nthis convention, as it was considered very important that it should\r\nrepeat its indorsement of the previous year. The delegation consisted\r\nof Miss Anthony, Miss Shaw, Mrs. Sargent, State president, Mrs. Mary\r\nWood Swift, Mrs. Sarah Knox Goodrich, Mrs. Mary S. Sperry, Mrs. Ida\r\nHusted Harper and Miss Mary G. Hay, members of the campaign committee.\r\nMiss Anthony and Miss Shaw addressed the Committee on Resolutions, and\r\nthe next day a plank declaring for the amendment was adopted by the\r\nbig convention with only one dissenting voice.\r\n\r\nOn May 12 most of these ladies attended the Populist Convention in\r\nSacramento. They were received with cheers, escorted to front seats,\r\ninvited to address the convention and the plank was unanimously\r\nadopted. From here a part of them went to the Prohibition Convention\r\nin Stockton, meeting a most cordial reception and a similar result.\r\nThe Socialist Labor and the National parties also indorsed the\r\namendment.\r\n\r\nThere was little hope for the indorsement of the Democratic\r\nConvention, but the ladies, reinforced by Mrs. Sarah B. and Miss\r\nHarriet Cooper, Mrs. Henry Krebs, Jr., Mrs. Alice M. Stocker and Mrs.\r\nE. O. Smith attended it on June 16. They were permitted to address the\r\nResolutions Committee and present a petition signed by about 40,000\r\nmen and women of the State asking for the amendment, but it was laid\r\non the table almost before they had left the room.[174]\r\n\r\nA minority report was at once prepared by Charles Wesley Reed and\r\nsigned by himself, William H. Alford, chairman of the committee, and\r\ntwo other members, but it was prevented from coming before the\r\nconvention by order of its chairman, Frank Gould of San Joaquin\r\nCounty. After the platform had been adopted Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw\r\nwere invited to address the convention, which they did to such effect\r\nthat when they had finished the minority report was demanded. It was\r\ntoo late for this but, in spite of the efforts of John P. Irish and W.\r\nW. Foote of Alameda County,[175] and others, the original resolution\r\ndeclaring for an amendment was brought to a vote, receiving 149 ayes,\r\n420 noes, more than one-fourth the whole number.\r\n\r\nThe women opened their campaign a few days later with an immense\r\nratification meeting in Metropolitan Temple. All of the political\r\nparties were represented by prominent men who made strong suffrage\r\nspeeches, Congressman James G. Maguire speaking for the fraction of\r\nthe Democratic party. Most of the ladies who had attended the\r\nconventions made addresses and there was the greatest enthusiasm. Miss\r\nAnthony was invited to speak at the ratification meeting of each of\r\nthe political parties and was most cordially received. No suffrage\r\ncampaign ever commenced so full of promise.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters were opened on Main Street in the fine new Parrott\r\nBuilding, five rooms being donated for the purpose by the manager of\r\nthe Emporium, William Harper. The furnishings were contributed by\r\ndifferent firms and individuals, and a handsome banner was swung\r\nacross the street. Here a force of women worked day and night for five\r\nmonths, most of them donating their services.[176]\r\n\r\nThe State Board and all the committees were composed of women of good\r\nposition and especial ability. The counties formed their own\r\norganizations and all the important towns had active local clubs. The\r\nreport from Southern California appears in another part of this\r\nchapter. In San Francisco Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper gave generously of her\r\nvaluable time and powerful influence. Mrs. Mary Wood Swift and Mrs.\r\nMary S. Sperry responded many times when the finances were at the\r\nlowest ebb. It would be impossible to name even a small fraction of\r\nthose who freely and continuously gave labor and money.\r\n\r\nEach of the eighteen assembly districts of San Francisco was organized\r\nby precincts, regular meetings were held, a personal canvass was made\r\nand an immense amount of literature was distributed. It is wholly\r\nimpracticable in a limited space to mention the work done by the\r\nvarious counties, as in each where the amendment was carried it was\r\ndue largely to the wise, faithful and unwearying efforts of its own\r\nwomen, and any distinction would be invidious.\r\n\r\nThe work of the W. C. T. U. deserves a prominent place in the history\r\nof the struggle, as all the powers of its excellent organization and\r\nexperienced workers were devoted to the success of the amendment, and\r\nthe majority in several counties at least was due to its efforts.\r\n\r\nFor the usual necessary and legitimate campaign purposes a fund of\r\nabout $19,000 was raised and sent to headquarters, almost wholly the\r\ncontributions of women.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony remained in San Francisco addressing meetings in that\r\ncity and making many short trips to neighboring towns, speaking once\r\nor more every day for eight months. During this time she made a tour\r\nof Central and Southern California, lecturing in halls, churches,\r\nwigwams, parlors, schoolhouses and the open air. In some places the\r\ntrain was stopped and she spoke from the rear platform which was then\r\nbanked with flowers.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Anna Howard Shaw spoke every night for seven months; Miss\r\nYates made about one hundred speeches; Mrs. Chapman Catt spent the\r\nlast two months in the State giving several addresses every day. Miss\r\nSarah M. Severance spoke under the auspices of the W. C. T. U.\r\nthroughout the campaign. Mrs. Naomi Anderson represented the colored\r\npeople. Every California woman who could make a speech was pressed\r\ninto service for clubs, ward meetings, etc. Many handsome homes were\r\nopened for parlor lectures. Miss Anthony herself addressed great\r\npolitical rallies of thousands of people; church conventions of every\r\ndenomination; Spiritualist and Freethinkers' gatherings; Salvation\r\nArmy meetings; African societies; Socialists; all kinds of labor\r\norganizations; granges; Army and Navy Leagues; Soldiers' Homes and\r\nmilitary encampments; women's clubs and men's clubs; Y. M. C. A.'s and\r\nW. C. T. U.'s. She spoke at farmers' picnics on the mountain tops, and\r\nBethel missions in the cellars of San Francisco; at parlor meetings in\r\nthe most elegant homes; and in pool-rooms where there was printed on\r\nthe blackboard, \"Welcome to Susan B. Anthony.\" Her services during the\r\nentire time were a personal contribution.\r\n\r\nThe attitude of the press was one of the remarkable features. Mrs. Ida\r\nHusted Harper was made Chairman of the Press Committee which had local\r\nmembers in every community. In company with Miss Anthony every editor\r\nin San Francisco was visited and assurances received that the\r\namendment would have respectful treatment. The _Call_, the _Record_\r\nand the _Post_ gave strong editorial indorsement, the latter\r\nmaintaining a daily department, the responsibility being largely taken\r\nby Dr. Sargent. Mrs. Harper had a long article each week in the\r\n_Sunday Call_ and many weeks one in the _Chronicle_ also. The\r\n_Examiner_ placed a column on the editorial page of its Sunday edition\r\nat the disposal of Miss Anthony and she filled it for seven months,\r\nbut the paper gave no official approval. The _Report_ had a double\r\ncolumn every Saturday edited by Miss Winnifred Harper. The _Bulletin_\r\nhad one conducted by Miss Eliza D. Keith, but editorially it was not\r\nfriendly. Mrs. Mary L. Wakeman Curtis rendered especially valuable\r\nservice. The Populist press was universally favorable, as were the\r\n_Star_ and other labor papers, the temperance, Socialist and A. P. A.\r\norgans, the leading Jewish papers, those of the colored people,\r\nseveral published in foreign languages and many in the interest of\r\nagriculture, insurance, etc.\r\n\r\nBefore the close of the campaign the press chairman was in\r\ncommunication with 250 papers in the State which declared editorially\r\nfor woman suffrage. Only 27 spoke openly against it, prominent among\r\nthese being the _San Francisco Chronicle_, _Argonaut_, _Sacramento\r\nRecord-Union_ and _Los Angeles Times_. From California papers alone\r\n9,000 clippings were received on this subject.\r\n\r\nHad it not been the year of a presidential election it is probable\r\nthat the amendment might have carried, but the bitter competition of\r\npolitics soon produced many complications and, although the suffrage\r\nquestion was kept absolutely non-partisan, it could not escape their\r\nserious effects. The demand for free silver had made such inroads on\r\nthe Republican party that it was threatened with the loss of the\r\nState, and it was soon made to understand by the liquor element that\r\nits continued advocacy of the suffrage amendment would mean a great\r\nloss of money and votes. It was found that the chairman of the State\r\nCentral Committee, Major Frank M'Laughlin, was notifying the county\r\nchairmen not to permit the women to speak at the Republican meetings,\r\nand it became very difficult to persuade the speakers of that party\r\nto refer to the amendment, although an indorsement of it was the first\r\nplank in their platform.\r\n\r\nThe Populists and Democrats found themselves in accord on financial\r\nquestions and in most localities a fusion was effected. While the\r\nformer, for the most part, were loyal to the amendment they could not\r\nfully control the speakers or platforms at the rallies and it was kept\r\nout of sight as much as possible. The A. P. A. was strongly organized\r\nin California and was waging a bitter war against the Catholic Church,\r\nand both feared the effect of the enfranchisement of women, although\r\nat the beginning the former seemed wholly in favor.\r\n\r\nThe women made a brave fight but these political conditions, added to\r\ninsufficient organization, too small a number of workers, lack of\r\nnecessary funds, the immense amount of territory to be covered, the\r\nlarge foreign population in San Francisco and the strong prejudices in\r\ngeneral against the movement, which must be overcome everywhere, made\r\ndefeat inevitable. The final blow was struck when, ten days before\r\nelection, the wholesale Liquor Dealers' League, which had been making\r\nits influence felt all during the campaign, met in San Francisco and\r\nresolved \"to take such steps as are necessary to protect our\r\ninterests.\" One of these steps was to send to the saloonkeepers, hotel\r\nproprietors, druggists and grocers throughout the State the following:\r\n\r\n     At the election to be held on November 3, Constitutional\r\n     Amendment No. Six, which gives the right to vote to women, will\r\n     be voted on.\r\n\r\n     It is to your interest and ours to vote against this amendment.\r\n     We request and urge you to vote and work against it and do all\r\n     you can to defeat it.\r\n\r\n     See your neighbor in the same line of business as yourself, and\r\n     have him be with you in this matter.\r\n\r\nAlthough the women had the written promise of the Secretary of State\r\nsaying, \"The amendment shall be third in order on the ballot, as\r\ncertified to me by the various county clerks,\" it was placed last,\r\nwhich made it the easy target for the mass of voters who could not\r\nread. Hundreds of tickets were cast in San Francisco on which the only\r\ncross was against this amendment, not even the presidential electors\r\nvoted for.\r\n\r\nThere were 247,454 votes cast on the suffrage amendment; 110,355 for;\r\n137,099 against; defeated by 26,744. The majority against in San\r\nFrancisco County was 23,772; in Alameda County, comprising Oakland,\r\nAlameda and Berkeley, 3,627; total 27,399--665 votes more than the\r\nwhole majority cast against the amendment. Berkeley gave a majority in\r\nfavor, so in reality it was defeated by the vote of San Francisco,\r\nOakland and Alameda.[177] Alameda is the banner Republican County and\r\ngave a good majority for the Republican ticket. There never had been a\r\nhope of carrying San Francisco for the amendment, but the result in\r\nAlameda County was a most unpleasant surprise, as the voters were\r\nprincipally Republicans and Populists, both of whom were pledged in\r\nthe strongest possible manner in their county conventions to support\r\nthe amendment, and every newspaper in the county had declared in favor\r\nof it. The fact remains, however, that a change of 13,400 votes in the\r\nentire State would have carried the amendment; and proves beyond\r\nquestion that, if sufficient organization work had been done, this\r\nmight have been accomplished in spite of the combined efforts of the\r\nliquor dealers and the political \"bosses.\"[178]\r\n\r\nAs it is almost universally insisted that woman suffrage amendments\r\nare defeated by the ballots of the ignorant, the vicious and the\r\nforeign born, an analysis of the vote of San Francisco, which contains\r\nmore of these elements than all the rest of California, is of\r\ninterest. Not one of the eighteen Assembly Districts was carried for\r\nthe amendment and but one precinct in the whole city. It is not\r\npracticable to draw an exact dividing line between the best and the\r\nworst localities in any city, but possibly the 28th, or water front,\r\ndistrict in San Francisco may come under the latter head and the 40th\r\nunder the former. The vote on the amendment in the 28th was 355 ayes,\r\n1,188 noes; in the 40th, 890 ayes, 2,681 noes, a larger percentage of\r\nopposition in the district containing the so-called best people.\r\nDistricts 37, 39, 40, 41, 42, 43 would probably be designated the most\r\naristocratic of the city. Their vote on the amendment was 5,189 ayes,\r\n13,615 noes, an opposing majority of 8,426, or about 1,400 to the\r\ndistrict. This left the remainder to be distributed among the other\r\neighteen districts, including the ignorant, the vicious and the\r\nforeign born, with an average of less than 1,300 adverse votes in each\r\ndistrict.\r\n\r\nThe proportion of this vote was duplicated in Oakland, the most\r\naristocratic ward giving as large a negative majority as the one\r\ncommonly designated \"the slums.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTHERN CALIFORNIA.[179]\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1885 the first woman suffrage association of Southern\r\nCalifornia was organized in Los Angeles at the home of Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nA. Kingsbury, a lecturer and writer of ability and a co-worker with\r\nthe Eastern suffragists in pioneer days. This small band of men and\r\nwomen held weekly meetings from this time until the opening of the\r\nAmendment Campaign in 1896, when it adjourned--subject to the call of\r\nits president--and its members became a part of the Los Angeles\r\nCampaign Committee.\r\n\r\nThe principal work of this early suffrage society was educational.\r\nOnce a month meetings were held to which the public was invited,\r\naddresses were given by able men and women, good music was furnished\r\nand suffrage literature distributed. For five years Mrs. Kingsbury\r\ncontinued its efficient president and then returned to her Eastern\r\nhome. She was succeeded by Mrs. Margaret V. Longley, another pioneer\r\nworker from the East, who served acceptably for the same length of\r\ntime, when Mrs. Alice Moore McComas was elected. Under her regime was\r\ncalled the first county suffrage convention ever held in the State.\r\n\r\nAll other organizations of women wholly ignored the suffrage\r\nassociation during these years. The Woman's Christian Temperance Union\r\nhad its franchise department, but it was by no means so popular as the\r\nother thirty-nine. Discouragement was met on every hand, but the\r\nfaithful few, adhering to the principles of political liberty, saw\r\nyear by year a slow but certain growth of sentiment in favor of the\r\nballot for women.\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1887, an effort was made to secure a bill from the\r\nLegislature conferring Municipal Suffrage upon women. Hundreds of\r\nletters were written and a large petition was sent but no action was\r\ntaken.[180] Every year afterward a bill asking for some form of\r\nsuffrage was presented to the Legislature, accompanied by great\r\npetitions signed by representative people, and an unremitting\r\nagitation was kept up throughout Southern California, until a strong\r\nsentiment was created in favor of the enfranchisement of women. Among\r\nthose who championed the cause in the Legislature in those days were\r\nR. N. Bulla, R. B. Carpenter, Edward Denio and W. S. Mellick. U. S.\r\nSenators George C. Perkins and Stephen M. White also gave their\r\ninfluence in its favor.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1892 the Southern California Woman's Parliament was\r\norganized. While the fact was emphasized that it was \"not a woman's\r\nrights society;\" the suffragists saw here an opportunity for good\r\nwork. The whole membership of their various organizations went into\r\nthis parliament and were active promoters of all the enterprises taken\r\nup, fully realizing that, sooner or later, in a body where all phases\r\nof woman's work--in the home, the church, the school and society--were\r\ndiscussed, woman's political limitations could not fail to receive\r\nattention. They were not mistaken for in a short time its sessions\r\nmight properly have been called \"woman's rights meetings,\" but none\r\nwere more careful not to mention this fact than the \"strong-minded\"\r\nmembers. The women who were afraid to be seen at suffrage meetings\r\nwere being so quietly converted that they had no idea of it. The\r\nsentiment grew and grew--and so did the suffrage association--until,\r\nafter consultation with various members of the Legislature, it was\r\ndecided to ask for an amendment to the State constitution which would\r\nenfranchise women.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile the Los Angeles Suffrage Association called a convention of\r\ndelegates from the southern counties in April, 1894, and a central\r\ncommittee was organized consisting of one representative woman from\r\neach voting precinct. This was productive of systematic work, and when\r\nthe Legislature the following winter submitted an amendment, workers\r\nin every city, town, hamlet and school district were ready for the\r\ncampaign.\r\n\r\nCounty campaign committees were organized of which that of Los\r\nAngeles was the leader, and from its headquarters the main work was\r\ncarried on. These, consisting of four large rooms on the second floor\r\nof the Muskegon block, a fine stone building in the business center of\r\nLos Angeles, were donated by T. D. Stimson. They were handsomely\r\nfurnished by friends with every requirement for office work and\r\nsemi-public meetings. Leo Alexander and William D. Hayward contributed\r\nthe typewriters. Their arrangement was in the hands of Mesdames J. H.\r\nBraly, A. M. Davidson, R. L. Craig and Laura B. Fay. All through that\r\never-to-be-remembered hot summer of 1896 these dainty, artistic rooms,\r\nconstantly supplied with fresh flowers, afforded a cool retreat for\r\nthe busy suffragists, as well as a resting place for their less active\r\nsisters who were invited to visit them, even if not in sympathy, and\r\nnone left without some of the literature and a gentle hint as to their\r\nobvious duty.\r\n\r\nIn San Diego the work was led by the president, Mrs. Flora M. Kimball.\r\nMrs. Kimball was the first woman ever elected Master of a Grange, and\r\nwas for eight years a member of the San Diego school board. She was a\r\nmost efficient manager and the beautiful grounds around her home were\r\nthe scene of many gatherings. A gifted writer also, her satires during\r\nthis campaign, over the signature \"Betty Snow, an anti-suffragist,\"\r\nmade many converts.\r\n\r\nProminent among the workers were Mrs. Annie Bristol Sloan, president\r\nof the San Diego County W. S. A., the Rev. Amanda Deyo, Dr. Lelia\r\nLatta and Mrs. Laura Riddell; Mrs. Helen Joslin Le Boeuf (Tustin),\r\norganizer of Orange County; Mrs. Lizzie H. Mills, secretary of the\r\nSouthern California W. C. T. U., and its president, Mrs. N. P. J.\r\nButton, who kept the question prominently before the people of\r\nRiverside County. Mrs. Ida K. Spears led the work in Ventura County\r\nwith pen and voice. Kern County though less densely settled had in its\r\nlittle clusters of humanity staunch friends of the cause under the\r\nleadership of Mrs. McLeod, and gave also its majority for the\r\namendment. San Bernardino was ably marshaled by Mrs. Ella Wilson\r\nMerchant, the county president. In Santa Barbara County Mrs. Emily\r\nWright had stood sponsor for the cause for many years, and Mrs. S. E.\r\nA. Higgins assisted with her facile pen. This county in its favorable\r\nvote ranked next to Los Angeles. The work was tremendous but the\r\nresult was compensating.\r\n\r\nThe key-note of the campaign was to reach every voter without regard\r\nto race or rank. Therefore, women of all castes and conditions were\r\nset to work where their direct influence would be most effective.\r\nHundreds of precinct meetings were held during the whole summer. Each\r\nprecinct had its own organization officered by its own people--men and\r\nwomen--a vice-president being appointed from each of its churches, and\r\nthis was called Campaign Committee Precinct No. ----, pledged to work\r\nonly until election. The meetings numbered from five to eighteen a\r\nday, and one day in August twenty-two were held in a single county. In\r\nthe city of Los Angeles the highest number in any one day was nine\r\nprecinct meetings and one public rally in the evening, near the close\r\nof the campaign. Mrs. McComas addressed four of these meetings and\r\nspoke at the rally--which was not unusual work for the speakers in the\r\nfield. From the afternoon meetings, held generally in the largest\r\nhomes in the precinct, hundreds of leaflets were sent out and every\r\neffort was made to increase the interest among women, for it was\r\nbelieved that if these did their duty the votes could be secured. The\r\nevening meetings were held principally in halls or churches, though\r\nfrequently the larger homes and hotel parlors were thrown open for a\r\nreception where men were the honored guests.\r\n\r\nThe churches of all Protestant denominations were offered for debates\r\nand entertainments. In several the Rev. Mila Tupper Maynard--the\r\nsalaried campaign speaker--preached Sunday evenings on texts pertinent\r\nto the subject, and many pastors delivered special sermons on equal\r\nrights. Leading hotels gave their parlors for precinct meetings and\r\nmany of the halls used for public gatherings were donated by the\r\nowners. Noontide meetings were held in workshops, factories and\r\nrailroad stations, and while the men ate their lunch a short suffrage\r\ntalk was given or some good leaflet read aloud. The wives of these men\r\nwere invited to take part, or to have full charge, and many earnest,\r\ncompetent workers were found among them who influenced these voters as\r\nno one else could do. The large proportion of foreign citizens were\r\nthus reached in a quiet, educational manner.\r\n\r\nAnother most effective method of work was carried on by the public\r\nmeeting committee. Every political organization had in its ranks some\r\nfather, husband, son or brother who was pledged to watch the suffrage\r\ninterests and report to this committee--composed of men from these\r\norganizations and women from the campaign committees--when and where a\r\nwedge could be put in for the amendment. Its main duty was to present\r\nat political meetings, through the most distinguished speaker on the\r\nprogram, a resolution favoring the amendment. In this way it was\r\ntreated as one of the general issues and, being brought before the\r\nvoters by one of their own speakers, did not give the annoyance that\r\nis sometimes felt when a lady is introduced for this purpose. In every\r\ninstance, the speaker would call upon the voters to \"honor themselves\r\nin honoring the women.\" This method became very popular and won many\r\nvotes where, otherwise, a hearing could not have been secured.\r\n\r\nAnother popular plan was that of utilizing the young people, who\r\nproved effective helpers. Every boy and girl who could sing, play,\r\ndeclaim, write an essay or in any other way entertain was enlisted for\r\noratorical debates, prize essays and public meetings.[181] Through\r\ntheir work many a young man cast his first vote for his mother.\r\n\r\nHearings were secured before clubs and organizations, when short\r\naddresses were made and resolutions adopted.[182]\r\n\r\nThe W. C. T. U. was throughout the campaign, active, efficient and\r\nhelpful, while its members were found on all the suffrage committees.\r\nValued assistance was given also by the Woman's Parliament, the church\r\nauxiliaries, labor unions, Christian Endeavor Societies, Epworth\r\nLeagues, theosophical societies and the Southern California\r\nFederation of Woman's Clubs--which devoted a whole session of its\r\nannual meeting to the question.\r\n\r\nThe Afro-American Congress, convening in Los Angeles, gave up an\r\nafternoon session to listen to Mrs. Naomi Anderson, the salaried\r\norganizer. This was followed up with faithful work by the Colored\r\nWoman's Club, its president, Dr. Mary T. Longley, assisted by Mesdames\r\nWashington, White, Jackson, Knott, Campbell, Clarkson and others,\r\nbeing instrumental in converting many of the colored men to a belief\r\nin suffrage for women. A number of them indeed became active workers,\r\nthe most prominent being the Rev. John Albright. Mrs. McComas\r\naddressed the Los Angeles County Republican Convention, which put in\r\nits platform a resolution in favor of the amendment.\r\n\r\nLiterature in small, concise leaflets was hung up in the street cars,\r\nrailroad offices, hotels, theaters and post-offices; wrapped in\r\ndry-goods and grocery parcels and placed in profusion in the public\r\nlibraries, many of these being compiled especially to suit certain\r\nlocalities. This required unceasing labor and watchfulness on the part\r\nof the press committee. Much original matter was used to show the\r\npeople that the women of their community were fully capable of\r\nexpressing their ideas and giving their reasons for desiring the\r\nballot.\r\n\r\nFourteen of the papers published in Los Angeles were friendly to the\r\namendment and gave it more or less editorial support, while three used\r\ntheir influence against it. The Los Angeles _Times_ was unyielding in\r\nits opposition throughout the campaign, although it published fair\r\nreports of the meetings. The _Sunday World_ kept pace with the _Liquor\r\nDealer_ in its coarse hostility, while the Pasadena _Town Talk_ was a\r\ngood second to both. The majority of the newspapers in Southern\r\nCalifornia were favorable to the proposed measure and were largely\r\nresponsible for its success in this section of the State.[183]\r\n\r\nThe most harmonious spirit existed at headquarters and among all the\r\nworkers. Enough money was raised to pay salaries to county presidents,\r\norganizers, corresponding secretary and one speaker. All others\r\ndonated their services. Among the series of county conventions called\r\nby the State board, Los Angeles not only paid its own expenses but\r\ncontributed $67 to the general State fund. This money was freely given\r\nby friends and workers, no special assessments being levied and no\r\ncollections taken at public meetings. Those who could not give largely\r\nworked the harder to secure contributions from those who could. Great\r\ncredit is due to the excellent management of the financial secretary,\r\nMrs. Almeda B. Gray, who labored constantly at headquarters from May\r\nto November, besides contributing a monthly instalment to the county\r\nfund. Much of it was also due to the wise and conservative policy of\r\nthe president of the campaign committee, Mrs. Elizabeth H. Meserve.\r\n\r\nIt would be impossible to give even the names of all who assisted in\r\nthis long and arduous campaign. The work was far-reaching, and many\r\nwere modest home-keepers who gave effective service in their own\r\nimmediate neighborhood.[184]\r\n\r\nThe amendment was defeated--for many reasons. Among the most\r\nconspicuous were ignorance of the real merits of the issue;\r\nindifference--for thousands of voters failed to vote either way; a\r\nsecret but systematic opposition to woman's voice in legislative\r\naffairs from the only organization against it--the Liquor Dealers'\r\nAssociation; and, most potent of all, a political combination which\r\nwould not have occurred except at the time of a presidential election.\r\nEvery county in Southern California gave a majority for the amendment,\r\nLos Angeles County leading with 4,600. Miss Anthony, who spent the\r\nsummer in California aiding and encouraging the women with her wisdom,\r\ncheerfulness and hope, said on leaving: \"The campaign was a\r\nmagnificent one, and it has developed many splendid workers who will\r\nbe ready for the next which is sure to come.\"\r\n\r\nAfter the disappointing result the Campaign Committee held a meeting,\r\npassed resolutions of fealty to the cause and adjourned _sine die_.\r\nBut in order to perpetuate the work already done and be ready for \"new\r\nbusiness\" at any time, the Los Angeles County Woman Suffrage League\r\nwas organized the following week, Mrs. Elmira T. Stephens, president;\r\nMrs. Gray, chairman of advisory board; Mrs. Craig, secretary. The\r\nnatural reaction after defeat followed and no work was done for\r\nseveral years.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1900, the State president, Mrs. Mary Wood Swift, came to\r\nLos Angeles and gave a parlor talk at the home of her hostess, Mrs. I.\r\nG. Chandler, and later an address at a public meeting in the Woman's\r\nClub House, of which Mrs. Caroline M. Severance was chairman.\r\nPractically all were in favor of reviving the old Woman Suffrage\r\nLeague and an executive committee was appointed, Mrs. Sarah Burger\r\nStearns (formerly of Minnesota), chairman.\r\n\r\nAt its call a meeting was held December 1, and the league reorganized:\r\nPresident, Mrs. Severance; vice-president, Mrs. Shelley Tolhurst;\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Carl Schutz; treasurer, Mrs. Amelia Griffith; chairman\r\nof executive committee, Mrs. Stearns. A leaflet announcing the\r\nformation of the league, its plan of work, etc., was largely\r\ncirculated. A committee was appointed who went before the Legislative\r\nConference, which was held later in the Chamber of Commerce, and\r\nexpressed the thanks of the league for the efforts of the Southern\r\nCalifornia members who had worked and voted for the School Suffrage\r\nBill at the previous session of 1899.\r\n\r\nThe executive committee meets once a month and special sessions are\r\ncalled whenever necessary. The plan of work, as outlined by Mrs.\r\nStearns, was sent to the State convention at San Francisco and\r\ncordially approved.\r\n\r\nIn February half of a show window on Broadway was secured, with ample\r\nfloor space back of it. With the donation of $100 by a Los Angeles\r\nwoman both were made attractive with flags, engravings and\r\nfurnishings. Above a handsome desk the suffrage flag with its four\r\nstars is draped and photographs of prominent women adorn the walls.\r\nThe suffrage papers are kept on file and quantities of fresh\r\nliterature are ready for distribution. Stationery, photographs,\r\nmedallions, etc., are for sale, a register is open for the enrollment\r\nof friends and a member of the league is always in attendance. When\r\nanother amendment campaign is to be made Southern California will be\r\nfound ready for work and will declare in its favor by a largely\r\nincreased majority.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nLAWS: The original property law of California is an inheritance from\r\nthe Mexicans, which it incorporated in its own code, and it is quite\r\nas unjust as those which still exist on the statute-books of some\r\nStates as a remnant of the barbarous old English Common Law. Community\r\nproperty includes all which is accumulated by the joint labors of\r\nhusband and wife after marriage. This is in the absolute control of\r\nthe husband. Previous to 1891 he could dispose of all of it as if he\r\nhad no wife, could will, sell, mortgage, pledge or give it away. That\r\nyear the Legislature enacted that he could not make a gift of it or\r\nconvey it without a valuable consideration, unless the wife consented\r\nin writing, although he could still dispose of it in ordinary business\r\ntransactions without her knowledge or consent. The decision in the\r\nSpreckles case apparently nullified this law, as the gift was made in\r\n1893 and the Supreme Court in 1897 declared it legal.[185]\r\n\r\nIn 1895 it was provided that at the husband's death the wife is\r\nentitled to one-half of what remains, subject to one-half of the\r\ndebts. At the death of the wife the whole belongs absolutely to the\r\nhusband without administration. If some portion of it may have been\r\nset apart for her support by judicial decree, this is subject to her\r\ntestamentary disposition, or, if she makes none, it passes to her\r\nheirs.\r\n\r\nA homestead to the value of $5,000, which must continuously be\r\noccupied by the family, may be selected from the community property,\r\nor from the husband's separate estate, or from the wife's with her\r\nconsent. If from the first-named it belongs to the survivor, if from\r\nthe separate property it descends to his or her heirs, subject to the\r\npower of the court to assign it to the family for a limited period.\r\nDuring marriage it can not be mortgaged or conveyed without the\r\nsignature of both. In case of divorce, if it has been selected from\r\ncommunity property, it may be assigned to the innocent party\r\nabsolutely or for a limited time, or it may be sold and the proceeds\r\ndivided, according to decree. If selected from separate property it\r\nshall be returned to the former owner, but the court may assign it for\r\na limited time to the innocent party.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 a law was passed that if the estate is less than $1,500 it\r\nshall be assigned to the widow, subject to incumbrances, funeral\r\ncharges and expenses of settlement.\r\n\r\nSeparate property consists in what was possessed before marriage or is\r\nreceived by gift or inheritance afterwards. If the deceased leave wife\r\nor husband and only one child, or the lawful issue of one, the\r\nseparate estate is divided in equal shares. If there be more than one\r\nchild or the issue of one, the widow or widower is entitled to\r\none-third. If there is no issue the survivor takes one-half and the\r\nother half goes to the father, mother, brothers and sisters of the\r\ndeceased. If none exists, the survivor is entitled to the whole\r\nestate.\r\n\r\nEither husband or wife may dispose of separate property without the\r\nconsent of the other. Until 1894 it rested upon the wife to prove that\r\nproperty was her separate possession, but now the proof rests upon the\r\ncontestants. Until 1897 she was compelled to prove that it was not\r\npaid for with community earnings. Neither of these recent laws applies\r\nto property acquired previous to May 19, 1889.\r\n\r\nA married woman may be administrator or executor. (1891.)\r\n\r\nThe wife may engage in business as sole trader and her husband is not\r\nliable for her contracts, but her earnings, and also any wages she\r\nmay make by her labor, are community property and belong absolutely to\r\nhim, and suit for them must be brought by him. By becoming a sole\r\ntrader she makes herself liable for the support of the family.\r\n\r\nA married woman may sue and be sued and make contracts in regard to\r\nher separate property, but in torts of a personal nature she must be\r\nsued jointly with her husband, although the wife may defend in her own\r\nright.\r\n\r\nUntil 1899 common law marriage was legal, and this consisted merely in\r\na promise and the mutual assumption of marital rights, duties and\r\nobligations. That year a law was passed requiring a license and a\r\ncivil or religious ceremony. The law declares specifically that \"the\r\nhusband is the head of the family and the wife is subject to him.\"\r\n\r\nThe wife may sue for separate maintenance without divorce.\r\n\r\nThe father is the guardian of the minor children and entitled to their\r\ncustody, services and earnings. At his death, or if he has abandoned\r\nhis family, the guardianship belongs to the mother, if suitable.\r\n\r\nThe husband is expected to give his family proper maintenance. There\r\nis no penalty for not supporting a wife but he can be arrested for\r\nfailure to support the children. If he have no property or is disabled\r\nfrom any cause, then the wife must support him and the family out of\r\nher property or her earnings. The husband decides what are necessaries\r\nand may take even her personal belongings to pay for them.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the W. C. T. U. asked to have the \"age of protection\" for\r\ngirls raised from 10 to 18 years, but secured only 14. In 1895 they\r\nsucceeded in having a bill passed for 18 years but it was vetoed by\r\nGov. James H. Budd. In 1897 they obtained one for 16 years which he\r\nsigned and it is now the law. The penalty is imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary for not less than five years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women possess no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, to make a test case, Mrs. Ellen Clark Sargent brought suit\r\nbefore Judge M. C. Sloss, of the Supreme Court of San Francisco, to\r\nrecover her taxes for that year, about $500. The city through its\r\nattorney filed a demurrer which was argued March 29 by George C.\r\nSargent, son of the plaintiff and a member of the bar. He based his\r\nmasterly argument on the ground that a constitution which declares\r\nthat \"all political power is inherent in the people\" has no right to\r\nexclude one-half of the people from the exercise of this inherent\r\npower. He quoted the most eminent authorities to prove that taxation\r\nand representation are inseparable; that the people of the United\r\nStates would have been slaves if they had not enjoyed the\r\nconstitutional right of granting or withholding their own money; that\r\nit is inseparably essential to the freedom of a people that no taxes\r\ncan be imposed upon them except with their consent given personally or\r\nby their representatives. He said in closing:\r\n\r\n     If Article I of the State constitution defines inalienable rights\r\n     and Article II abrogates them, it is monarchy. The Code of Civil\r\n     Procedure says that where one of two constructions is in favor of\r\n     natural right and the other against it, the former shall be\r\n     accepted. The question is whether the Court shall grant this\r\n     right, or whether by toil and struggle it shall be wrung from the\r\n     consciences of the electors.\r\n\r\nThe court decided that the case required a mandamus before the\r\nRegistrar. Application was then made for a writ of mandate against the\r\nRegistrar of Elections to compel him to place Mrs. Sargent's name upon\r\nthe list of voters. Should this be denied she asked to have her taxes\r\nreturned. Both demands were refused by Judge Sloss in the Superior\r\nCourt. He took the ground that if Mr. Sargent's argument should be\r\ncarried to its logical conclusion it would enfranchise idiots,\r\nlunatics and criminals; that if there is a conflict between the two\r\nsections of the constitution cited it should be settled in favor of\r\nlimiting the suffrage to males, as where a general and a particular\r\nprovision are inconsistent the latter is paramount to the former. He\r\nquoted various State Supreme Court decisions and declared that he\r\ndecided the case according to the law.[186]\r\n\r\nAs Mrs. Sargent had every assurance that this judgment would be\r\nsustained by the Supreme Court she did not carry the case further. It\r\nattracted attention and comment in all parts of the country and she\r\nreceived encouragement and wishes for her success from all classes of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: The Legislature of 1873 made women eligible to all\r\nSchool offices. None ever has been elected State Superintendent of\r\nPublic Instruction but there is scarcely a county where women have not\r\nserved as superintendents. At present seventeen are acting in this\r\ncapacity. They have frequently been elected School Trustees and a\r\nwoman is now president of the San Francisco school board at a salary\r\nof $3,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nThe constitution is interpreted to prohibit women from holding any\r\nother office. It is claimed by some that this does not include the\r\nboards of State institutions, but out of twenty-six such boards and\r\ncommissions only one ever has had a woman member--Mrs. Phoebe A.\r\nHearst, who is on the Board of Regents of the State University.\r\n\r\nThere are women on local library boards. A woman has been assistant\r\nState Librarian, and there have been women deputies and clerks in\r\ncounty and city offices. At present in the offices of the\r\nAttorney-General, Board of Examiners, State Department of Highways and\r\nDebris Committee women hold positions as clerks at salaries of from\r\n$1,200 to $1,800. They may serve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1899 the California Woman's Club resurrected an old\r\nlaw which never had been enforced, providing for the appointment of\r\nassistant women physicians at the hospitals for the insane \"provided\r\nthere are already three assistant male physicians.\" They petitioned\r\nthe proper authorities and the matter was presented to the State\r\nLunacy Commission by Gov. Henry T. Gage with his earnest indorsement.\r\nFrom highly qualified candidates, whom the club had in readiness, two\r\nwere appointed, and the promise was made that others should be at an\r\nearly date. In a short time the superintendent of one hospital wrote\r\nthat he did not see how they ever had managed without a woman\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nA woman physician is on the Board of Health in Oakland.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 a law was passed providing for jail matrons in cities of\r\n100,000 and over. This included only San Francisco and was not\r\nmandatory. In 1901 a law was secured requiring all cities of over\r\n15,000 to have a matron at jails and city prisons, to be appointed\r\nfor two years at a salary of $50, $65 or $75 a month, according to the\r\nsize of the city.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: After the hard struggle to obtain a law admitting women\r\nto the bar in 1877, a long contest followed to secure their admission\r\nto the Hastings College of Law, a branch of the State University,\r\nwhich ended in a favorable decision of the Supreme Court.[187] As a\r\nresult of these efforts the constitutional convention of 1879\r\nincorporated a provision that \"No person shall, on account of sex, be\r\ndisqualified from entering upon or pursuing any lawful business,\r\nvocation or profession.\" This does not, however, include appointive or\r\nelective offices.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: This same constitution of 1879 provided also that \"No\r\nperson shall be debarred admission to any of the collegiate\r\ndepartments of the State University on account of sex.\" Most of the\r\nsmaller colleges are co-educational.\r\n\r\nThe assertion will hardly be questioned that the gifts of women for\r\neducational purposes in all parts of the Union, in all time, do not\r\nequal those made by the women of California within the last decade. As\r\na memorial to their son, U. S. Senator and Mrs. Leland Stanford\r\nerected the Leland Stanford, Jr., University at Palo Alto in 1890 and\r\nendowed it with many millions of dollars. Mr. Stanford's death before\r\nit was fully completed threw the estate into litigation for a number\r\nof years, the legality of even some portion of the university\r\nendowment being in doubt. He left the bulk of his great fortune to his\r\nwife, and, after the estate was settled and free from all\r\nencumbrances, she reaffirmed the titles of all previous gifts and\r\nadded the largest part of her own property. The endowment is now about\r\n$30,000,000, all but $4,000,000 of this having been given by Mrs. Jane\r\nLathrop Stanford. This is the largest endowment ever made by any one\r\nperson for one institution, and places Stanford at the head of the\r\nendowed universities of the world. It has been co-educational in all\r\ndepartments from the beginning and the tuition is practically free.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Mrs. Miranda Lux of San Francisco left a bequest of $750,000\r\nfor a school of manual training for both sexes. In 1898 Miss Cora Jane\r\nFlood of San Francisco conveyed to the University of California her\r\nmagnificent estate at Menlo Park and 4,000 shares of stocks, valued at\r\nnot far from $1,000,000. The request was made that the income should\r\nbe devoted to some branch of commercial education. Mrs. Jane Krom\r\nSather of Oakland has given about $200,000 to the University. The\r\ndonations of Mrs. Phoebe A. Hearst have been thus far about $300,000,\r\nbut this is merely preliminary to the great endowment of millions for\r\nwhich she has arranged. It is exclusive also of $30,000 a year for\r\nseveral archæological expeditions. Liberal gifts have been made by\r\nother women.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 1,722 men and 6,425 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $81.08; of the women $64.76.\r\nAs a law of 1873 requires equal pay of teachers for equal work, these\r\nfigures show that the highly salaried positions are largely occupied\r\nby men.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWomen's clubs play a very prominent part in the social life. Of these,\r\n111 with a membership of over 7,000 belong to the State Federation.\r\nThe oldest in the State is the Ebell of Oakland, organized over\r\ntwenty-five years ago, and having now a handsome club house and a\r\nmembership of 500. It raised $20,000 to purchase a site for the new\r\nCarnegie Library. The Century Club of San Francisco with 275 members\r\nis one of the oldest and most influential; the California Club has an\r\nactive membership of 400; and there are a number of other flourishing\r\nclubs in that city, Oakland, Berkeley, Alameda and Sacramento, of from\r\n175 to 250 members. The Friday Morning Club of Los Angeles, with a\r\nmembership of 500, owns a beautiful club house. The Ebell of that city\r\nhas 300 members, and clubs of from 150 to 200 are found in various\r\nplaces in Southern California.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[162] The History is indebted for most of the material in this chapter\r\nto Mrs. Ellen Clark Sargent of San Francisco, honorary president, and\r\nMiss Carrie A.

Hay, chairman.\r\n\r\n[173] Later Mrs. Ida Crouch Hazlitt of Colorado, Mrs. Laura M. Riddell\r\nof San Diego and other State women were added to the organizing force.\r\n\r\n[174] Dr. Elizabeth Sargent was chairman of the Committee on Petitions\r\nfor Northern and Mrs. Alice Moore McComas for Southern California. As\r\nthe names had to be collected in the winter months preceding the\r\nspring campaign, the distances to be covered were long and the labor\r\nwas the free offering of busy women, it is surprising that the list\r\nwas so large. It by no means represented the suffrage sentiment in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\n[175] Alameda had sent in the largest petition for woman suffrage of\r\nany county in the State, and San Joaquin afterwards gave a big\r\nmajority vote for the amendment.\r\n\r\n[176] A number of young women who were engaged the greater part of\r\nevery day in teaching, stenography, bookkeeping, etc., gave every hour\r\nthat could be spared to the work at headquarters, a free will\r\noffering. Among those who deserve special mention are Misses Mary,\r\nLouise and Sarah Donnelly, Mary Gorham, Clara Schlingheyde, Effie\r\nScott Vance, Evelyn Grove, Mrs. N. W. Palmer, Winifred and Marguerite\r\nWarner and Carrie A. Whelan. Mrs. Lelia S. Martin also contributed\r\nfive months' time.\r\n\r\n[177] Los Angeles County gave a majority of 4,600 in favor of the\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n[178] Many personal incidents and anecdotes of this campaign will be\r\nfound in the Life and Work of Susan B. Anthony, Chap. XLVII.\r\n\r\n[179] This portion of the chapter was prepared by Mrs. Alice Moore\r\nMcComas, former president of the Los Angeles Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation and chairman of the Southern California press committee\r\nduring the amendment campaign of 1896. A considerable amount of space\r\nis given because it presents so admirable an example of the manner in\r\nwhich the work in such a campaign should be done.\r\n\r\n[180] The first paper to establish a Suffrage Column was the Los\r\nAngeles _Express_, in 1887, H. Z. Osborne, editor. This was conducted\r\nby Mrs. McComas for three years.\r\n\r\n[181] Among the many were Gertrude Foster, the young California\r\nactress, who added attraction to many programs with her brilliant\r\nreadings, and Jessie, daughter of Superior Judge Waldo York, who won\r\nthe prize of $75 offered by Dr. Ella Whipple Marsh, superintendent of\r\nfranchise of the Southern California W. C. T. U., for the best essay\r\non woman suffrage, one hundred young people of both sexes competing.\r\nAn oratorical contest for young college men--original orations on\r\nwoman suffrage--resulted in a $20 prize to Edwin Hahn of Pomona\r\nCollege, five young men participating. Clare, daughter of Judge C. C.\r\nMcComas, gave highly-appreciated recitations on the woman question,\r\nand Miss Nina Cuthbert, the young teacher of elocution, delighted many\r\naudiences with her readings and wonderful imitations.\r\n\r\n[182] Prominent among these were the Single Tax Club, Royal Arcanum,\r\nForesters, Native Daughters of the Golden West, Socialist League, Y.\r\nM. C. A., Carpenters' Union, Woman's Relief Corps, Y. W. C. A., Friday\r\nMorning Woman's Club and the Fraternal Brotherhood.\r\n\r\n[183] It is regretted that the carefully compiled list of these\r\npapers, sent by Mrs. McComas, is too long to be used.

Justice Temple rendered the\r\ndecision as follows:\r\n\r\n\"All these differences point to the fact that the husband is absolute\r\nowner of the community property. The marital community was not\r\nacquired for the purpose of accumulating property, and the husband\r\nowes no duty to the community or to the wife, either to labor or\r\naccumulate money, or to save or to practice economy to that end. He\r\nowes his wife and children suitable maintenance, and if he has\r\nsufficient income from his separate estate he need not engage in\r\nbusiness, or so live that there can be community property. If he earns\r\nmore than is sufficient for such maintenance, he violates no legal\r\nobligation if he spends the surplus in extravagance or gives it away.\r\nThe community property may be lost in visionary schemes or in mere\r\nwhims. Within the law he may live his life, although the community\r\nproperty is dissipated. Of course I am not now speaking of moral\r\nobligations.\"\r\n\r\n[186] During this trial Mrs. Sargent and her friends in attendance\r\nwere caricatured in the most shameless manner by the San Francisco\r\n_Call_, which had passed under a new management.\r\n\r\n[187] See History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. III, p. 757.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXIX.\r\n\r\nCOLORADO.[188]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the campaign of 1877, when a woman suffrage amendment was\r\ndefeated in Colorado, the first really important step forward was the\r\norganization at Denver, in 1890, of a little club to aid the campaign\r\nin South Dakota. In April Miss Matilda Hindman, who was working there,\r\ncame from that State to ask assistance and formed a committee of six,\r\nwho pledged themselves to raise $100. They were Miss Georgiana Watson,\r\npresident; Mrs. Susan Sharman, secretary; Mrs. Mary J. Nichols,\r\ntreasurer; and Mesdames Amy K. Cornwall, Jennie P. Root and Lavinia C.\r\nDwelle.\r\n\r\nShortly afterward Mrs. Louise M. Tyler removed from Boston to Denver,\r\nbearing a letter from Lucy Stone urging Colorado suffragists to unite\r\nin an organization auxiliary to the National Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation. Mrs. Tyler heard of this small band, called with Mrs.\r\nElizabeth P. Ensley, delivered her message, and their names were added\r\nto the list of members. The organization was completed and became an\r\nauxiliary.\r\n\r\nAbout this time Mrs. Leonora Barry Lake followed her lecture,\r\ndelivered under the auspices of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union\r\nby an appeal to the women of the audience to join the suffrage\r\nassociation; and among those who responded were two whose ears had\r\nlonged for such a gospel sound, Mrs. Emily R. Meredith and her\r\ndaughter Ellis. Temperance women who repeatedly had found their work\r\ndefeated by the lack of \"the right preservative of rights,\" such women\r\nas Mrs. Anna Steele, Mrs. Ella L. Benton, Mrs. Eliza J. Patrick and\r\nothers, thought truly that a society whose sole aim should be the\r\nballot was a necessity. At this time the meetings were held in Mrs.\r\nTyler's parlor. Miss Watson was much occupied with school duties, and\r\nin the fall of 1890 Mrs. Tyler was chosen president in her stead.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 a petition for the right of suffrage by constitutional\r\namendment was presented to the Legislature, but the bill not being\r\nintroduced within the specific time it went by default. Ashamed of\r\ntheir lack of political acumen, the women then persuaded\r\nRepresentative F. F. O'Mahoney, who had a bill prohibiting foreigners\r\nfrom voting on their first naturalization papers, to strike the word\r\n\"male\" from his measure, thus making it an equal suffrage enactment,\r\nbut bill and rider were defeated. The ladies who worked for suffrage\r\nwere treated with such scant courtesy by some of the legislators, and\r\nthe general sentiment was so adverse, that ultimate success looked\r\nvery distant to the most sanguine friends.\r\n\r\nSome of the club even questioned the advisability of giving an\r\nafternoon a week, as they had been doing, to the study of a government\r\nin which they had no part and might never hope to have. Mrs. Sharman,\r\na small, delicate woman, who already had passed four-score years, was\r\nits inspiration. She advised the members to remain united, ready for\r\nactive effort when opportunity offered, and in the meantime to\r\ncontinue as seed-sowers and students of citizenship in the preparatory\r\ndepartment.\r\n\r\nThe membership slowly increased. Mrs. Tyler served as president until\r\n1892, when Mrs. Olive Hogle was elected. Mrs. Benton (Adams) had given\r\nthe use of her rooms in the central part of Denver, and the society\r\nremained with her until, having outgrown its quarters, it accepted the\r\nhospitality of Dr. Minnie C. T. Love early in 1893.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1891 a small majority of its members had put up a\r\nwoman candidate for the East Denver school board and tried their\r\n\"prentice hands\" at voting. It is a settled fact that a partial\r\nsuffrage seldom awakens much interest. The school ballot had been\r\ngiven to women by the constitution when Colorado became a State, but\r\nhere, as elsewhere, they exercised it only when aroused by some\r\nespecial occasion. Mrs. Scott Saxton was the candidate selected. The\r\nwiser of the suffragists thought the work should have been undertaken\r\nsooner, if at all, as there was not then sufficient time for\r\ncanvassing, and the result proved they were right. More women voted\r\nthan ever before, but the men opposed to women on the school board\r\ncame out in still greater numbers. Twelve hundred ballots were\r\ncast--by far the largest school vote ever polled in the district. Of\r\nthese about 300 were for Mrs. Saxton.\r\n\r\nTwo years later this effort was repeated and other organizations of\r\nwomen aided the suffragists. Mrs. Ione T. Hanna was the candidate.\r\nThere were four tickets in the field and over 6,000 votes were cast.\r\nThis time both men and women voted in favor and, in the face of bitter\r\nopposition, Mrs. Hanna was elected by 1,900 majority.\r\n\r\nA bill providing that the question of full suffrage for women should\r\nbe submitted to the voters at the next general election was drawn by\r\nJ. Warner Mills and presented in the House early in 1893 by J. T.\r\nHeath. On this, and all other occasions when advice or assistance was\r\nneeded, Mr. Mills gave his legal services without charge.\r\n\r\nThis was indeed the golden opportunity, the tide which taken at the\r\nflood might lead on to fortune. The Populist party, which was in\r\npower, had a suffrage plank in its State platform; in both the other\r\nparties there were individuals who favored it; and, if the bill\r\npassed, the Governor's signature was a certainty. But there are as\r\nmany vicissitudes in the life of a bill as in that of an infant. It is\r\nthrown in the midst of its fellows to struggle for existence, and the\r\noutcome is not a question of the survival of the fittest but of the\r\none that receives the best nursing. If it escapes the death that lurks\r\nin the committee room, it still may be gently crowded toward the edge\r\nuntil it falls into the abyss which awaits bills that never reach the\r\nthird reading.\r\n\r\nMrs. Tyler, chairman of legislative work, gave a large share of her\r\ntime during the entire session to looking after the bill in the House,\r\nand Miss Minnie J. Reynolds was equally untiring in the Senate. Three\r\nother suffrage bills were introduced that session but two yielded\r\nprecedence to the one prepared by the association. The author of the\r\nthird believed that women could obtain suffrage only through a\r\nconstitutional amendment, which was what his bill called for. The\r\nwomen received such contradictory advice on this point as to awaken\r\nmuch anxiety. However, they read in their meetings a copy of the\r\nstatutes of Colorado, and possessing only plain common sense and not\r\nthe legal ability which would have qualified them for a place in the\r\nSupreme Court, concluded that the referendum to the voters, which\r\ntheir bill provided for, was the proper thing to request.\r\n\r\nThe opposition came from the usual sources. After the bill was\r\npresented, the _Remonstrance_, the organ of the anti-suffrage society\r\nin Boston, soon appeared on the desk of every legislator. The liquor\r\ninfluence also was prominent in the lobby.\r\n\r\nThe bill was reported from the committee to the House on Jan. 24,\r\n1893, with the recommendation that it should not pass and a minority\r\nreport in favor. The former was rejected by a vote of 39 to 21. The\r\nbill was brought to a final vote on March 8. A number of the members\r\nof the suffrage club and some other women who approved their cause\r\nwere present by request of the friends in the House. Some of the\r\narguments used were peculiar. Ruth didn't vote and she married very\r\nwell (at least at the second trial) nor did any of the women referred\r\nto in the Bible, so why should the women of the United States do so?\r\nOne Representative said he always attended to affairs out of doors and\r\nleft those within to his wife. He thought that was the right way and\r\ndidn't believe his wife would vote if she could. \"But she says she\r\nwould,\" declared another, who was prompted by Mrs. Tyler, and a ripple\r\nof laughter arose at the speaker's expense.\r\n\r\nThere was the customary talk about neglected homes and implied\r\ndisbelief in woman's ability to use the ballot rightly, but only one\r\nman tried the weapon of insult. Robert W. Bonynge spoke so slightingly\r\nof the character of women who upheld equal suffrage that one incensed\r\nwoman, not a member of the association and presumably ignorant of\r\nparliamentary courtesy, gave a low hiss. Immediately he assumed the\r\ndenunciatory and threatened immediate expulsion of all persons not\r\nmembers from the House. Frank Carney then arose and referred to the\r\nfact that the anti-suffrage speakers had received repeated applause\r\nfrom their adherents and no notice had been taken of it, although it\r\nwas equally out of place. Mr. Bonynge subsided from his position and\r\ncontinued his speech.[189]\r\n\r\nThe bill finally passed by 34 ayes, 27 noes; divided politically as\r\nfollows: Ayes, 22 Populists, 11 Republicans, 1 Democrat; noes, 3\r\nPopulists, 21 Republicans, 3 Democrats.\r\n\r\nHamilton Armstrong had introduced the bill into the Senate, where it\r\nhad been tabled to await the action of the House. It passed on April 3\r\nby 20 ayes, 10 noes: Ayes, 12 Populists, 8 Republicans, no Democrat;\r\nnoes, one Populist, 4 Republicans, 5 Democrats.\r\n\r\nThe bill received the signature of the Populist governor, Davis H.\r\nWaite, without delay.\r\n\r\nA general election was to be held in the fall of 1893, so that the\r\nverdict of the voters was soon to follow. At the annual meeting of the\r\nState Woman Suffrage Association that spring the officers chosen were:\r\nPresident, Miss Martha Pease; vice-president, Mrs. Ellis Meredith;\r\nsecretary, Mrs. C. S. Bradley; treasurer, Mrs. Ensley; chairman\r\nexecutive committee, Mrs. Tyler. On motion of Mrs. Meredith, the name\r\nof the society was changed to the Non-Partisan Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation of Colorado, as in the word \"equal\" there is an appeal to\r\njustice which does not seem to exist in the word \"woman.\"\r\n\r\nThe women realized the conflict before them in the near future, and\r\nMrs. Ellis Meredith volunteered to visit the Woman's Congress, which\r\nwas to meet at Chicago in May, during the World's Fair, and appeal for\r\naid to the representatives of the National Association who would be\r\nthere. Miss Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. Lucy Stone and other notables were\r\npresent and appointed a meeting to listen to appeals. These asked help\r\nfor the Constitutional Convention Campaign in New York and the Kansas\r\nAmendment Campaign, which were both considered very hopeful compared\r\nto what was thought in the East to be the almost hopeless campaign in\r\nColorado. Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake presented the claims of New York,\r\nMrs. Laura M. Johns of Kansas, and Mrs. Meredith of Colorado. \"Why was\r\nyour campaign precipitated when our hands are so full?\" was one of\r\nthe discouraging questions. \"Are all those Mexicans dead?\" asked Miss\r\nAnthony, referring to the heavy vote against equal suffrage in the\r\nfirst Colorado campaign of 1877. \"No,\" said Mrs. Meredith, \"the\r\nMexicans are all there yet;\" but she explained that there were\r\nfavorable influences now which did not then exist. In the labor unions\r\nwomen members voted, and this fact inclined the men belonging to them\r\nto grant the full franchise. The W. C. T. U., now organized throughout\r\nthe State, had become a firm friend and advocate, and the ruling\r\npolitical party was favorable. Clearly this was the time to strike.\r\n\r\nA promise of consideration and such aid as the National Association\r\nwas able to furnish was given. Later they decided to send Mrs. Carrie\r\nChapman Catt and guarantee her expenses in case she was not able to\r\nraise them in the State. From her past record, they thought it likely\r\nshe would not only do that but put money in the treasury, and the\r\nresult justified their expectations. She was a financial help, but,\r\nmuch as money was needed, her eloquence and judgment were worth more,\r\nand she always will have a warm place in the hearts of Colorado women\r\nwho were active in the campaign of 1893.\r\n\r\nWhen that campaign opened, there were just $25 in the treasury. Lucy\r\nStone sent a donation of $100. Iowa and California gave aid, and there\r\nwere small contributions in money from members of the E. S. A. and\r\nfrom auxiliary clubs formed by Mrs. Chapman Catt in different parts of\r\nthe State.\r\n\r\nBesides these, others already had been organized. In Longmont a club\r\nwas formed in the spring of 1893 by Mesdames Mary L. Carr, Orpha\r\nBacon, Rosetta Webb and Jane Lincoln. They took up the study of laws\r\nrelating to the property rights of women and endeavored to awaken\r\ninterest in the question to be settled the following November. The\r\nmajority which Longmont gave for suffrage is a testimony to the value\r\nof their work. In Colorado Springs Mrs. Mary C. C. Bradford was\r\npresident of a large local society which afterward became auxiliary to\r\nthe State association, with Mrs. Ella L. C. Dwinnell as president, and\r\ndid excellent work in El Paso County. In Greeley many of the workers\r\nof 1877 were still active. Mrs. Lillian Hartman Johnson organized a\r\nclub in Durango and spoke for the cause. Mrs. A. Guthrie Brown formed\r\none in Breckinridge of which Mesdames H. R. Steele, C. L. Westermann\r\nand E. G. Brown were active members.\r\n\r\nAll these clubs, large and small, scattered throughout the State,\r\nassisted in arousing public sentiment, but the situation in Denver was\r\nthe one of most anxious interest. It is always in cities that reforms\r\nmeet defeat, for there the opposing interests are better organized and\r\nmore watchful. In no other State is the metropolis so much the center\r\nof its life as is Denver of Colorado. Through this modern Palmyra,\r\nwhich stands in the center of the continent and of the tide of\r\ncommerce from East and West, flow all the veins and arteries of the\r\nState life. Arapahoe County, in which it is situated, contains more\r\nthan one-fourth of the population of the entire State. Upon the women\r\nof Denver, therefore, was imposed a triple share of responsibility.\r\nBesides the importance of the large vote, there rested particularly\r\nupon the members of its suffrage club the burden of having invited\r\nthis contest and made it a campaign issue.\r\n\r\nIn the early fall, the City League of Denver was organized with 100\r\nmembers and Mrs. John L. Routt, wife of the ex-governor, as president.\r\nMrs. Thomas M. Patterson and Mrs. N. P. Hill were prominent workers in\r\nthis club. A Young Woman's League was formed by Misses Mary and\r\nMargaret Patterson and Miss Isabel Hill, and there were other leagues\r\nin various parts of the city. In all this work Mrs. Tyler was\r\nindefatigable.\r\n\r\nMiss Minnie J. Reynolds, chairman of press work, enlisted the help of\r\nseventy-five per cent. of the newspapers. In some cases editorial\r\napproval and assistance were given, in others space was allowed for\r\nsuffrage matter. In August Mrs. Elizabeth Tabor donated the use of two\r\nrooms in the opera house block, one large enough to seat several\r\nhundred persons, the other a suitable office for the corresponding\r\nsecretary. Dr. Minnie C. T. Love had acted gratuitously in that\r\ncapacity and opened communication with suffragists throughout the\r\nState, but it was now deemed necessary to employ some one who could\r\ndevote her entire time to the work. Miss Helen M. Reynolds was chosen\r\nand added to unusual capability the most earnest zeal. The rooms were\r\nfurnished through loans of rugs, desks, chairs, etc.\r\n\r\nEqual suffrage was indorsed by the county conventions of the\r\nRepublican, Prohibition and Populist parties, and also at a called\r\nmeeting of the Democratic State Central Committee. Many ministers and\r\nlawyers spoke in its favor. Among the latter were Charles S. Thomas,\r\nsince governor of the State, J. Warner Mills, Judge L. C. Rockwell,\r\nCharles Hartzell, Eugene Engley and Attorney-General I. N. Stevens,\r\nwho was one of the most trusted advisers.\r\n\r\nThere were also women speakers of experience: Mrs. Therese Jenkins of\r\nWyoming, Mrs. Susan S. Fessenden of Massachusetts; Mrs. Dora Phelps\r\nBuell, Mrs. Mary Jewett Telford, president of the Woman's Relief Corps\r\nin the Department of Colorado and Wyoming and also president for\r\nseveral terms of the State W. C. T. U., who made a five-months'\r\nspeaking tour; Mrs. Leonora Barry Lake of St. Louis, who spoke\r\nefficiently under the auspices of the Knights of Labor. Mrs. Laura\r\nOrmiston Chant of England delivered an address on her way westward.\r\n\r\nSome women made speeches who never had been on the platform before but\r\nhave since developed much oratorical ability. When needed, women who\r\ndid not dare risk an unwritten address read papers. Meetings were held\r\nall over the city and State. \"I should think,\" said a banker, \"from\r\nthe campaign the women are running that they had a barrel of money;\"\r\nbut he was a contributor to the fund and knew it was very limited. In\r\nall about $2,000 were raised, over $300 of which were spent for\r\nliterature. Some of the most efficient leaflets were written by\r\nmembers of the association and printed in Denver. Nearly 150,000 of\r\nthese were issued.\r\n\r\nIn the city press Mrs. Patience Mapleton represented the cause in the\r\n_Republican_; Mrs. Ellis Meredith in the _Rocky Mountain News_. There\r\nwere house to house canvassers, distributors of literature and others\r\nwho rendered most valuable assistance and yet whose names must\r\nnecessarily remain unrecorded. The most of this service was given\r\nfreely, but some of the women who devoted all their time received\r\nmoderate salaries, for most of the workers belonged to the\r\nwage-earning class. The speakers asked no compensation but their\r\nexpenses were frequently borne. Halls and churches had to be paid for\r\nand on several occasions opera houses were rented. When in the final\r\nreport the expenses of election day were given as $17 a murmur of\r\namusement ran through the audience.\r\n\r\nThe women who \"had all the rights they wanted\" appeared late in the\r\ncampaign. Some of them sent communications to the papers, complaining\r\nof the effort to thrust the ballot upon them and add to the already\r\nonerous duties of life. When told that they would not be compelled to\r\nvote and that if silent influence was in their opinion more potent\r\nthan the ballot, it would not be necessary to cast it aside for the\r\nweaker weapon, they responded indignantly that if they had the\r\nfranchise of course it would be their duty to use it. Let it be noted\r\nthat many of them have voted regularly ever since they were\r\nenfranchised, though some have reconsidered and returned to their\r\nsilent influence.\r\n\r\nThe liquor element slept in fancied security until almost the eve of\r\nelection, as they did not believe the amendment would receive popular\r\nsanction. When they awoke to the danger they immediately proceeded to\r\nassess all saloon keepers and as many as possible of their prominent\r\npatrons. They got out a large number of dodgers, which were put into\r\nthe hands of passers-by. These were an attack upon equal suffrage and\r\nthe women who advocated it, and at the bottom of the first issue was a\r\nbrewer's advertisement. This dodger stated that \"only some old maids\r\nlike Lucy Stone, Susan Anthony, Frances Willard, Elizabeth Stanton and\r\nMary Livermore wanted to vote.\" They also employed an attorney to\r\njuggle the ballots so that they might be thrown out on a technicality.\r\nThere was consternation among the suffragists when the ballot was\r\nfinally produced bearing the words \"For the Amendment,\" \"Against the\r\nAmendment,\" for it was well known that the measure was not an\r\n\"amendment.\" The best legal talent in Denver was consulted and an\r\nopinion rendered that the ruse would prove of no avail, as the\r\nintention was still clear. The women, however, issued a leaflet\r\ninstructing the voters just where to put the cross on the ticket if\r\nthey wished to vote for equal suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists were divided in opinion as to the presence of women at\r\nthe polls on the election day which was to decide their fate. Some\r\nthought it might be prejudicial, but the friends among the men\r\nstrongly approved their presence in order to influence voters. What\r\nfuture election could be of more importance to women than this, and\r\nwhy should they hesitate to show their interest? Under directions from\r\nsuffrage headquarters workers at the polls distributed the leaflets,\r\noften supplementing them by their own eloquence. No woman received any\r\ndiscourtesy.\r\n\r\nThe night of November 7 was an anxious one. Women went home and lay\r\nawake wondering whether they had done everything possible to insure\r\nsuccess, or whether failure might be the result of some omission. When\r\nthe returns published the next morning, although incomplete, showed\r\nthat success really had crowned their efforts it seemed almost too\r\ngood to be true. All day long and in the evening people were coming\r\nand going at suffrage headquarters with greetings and congratulations.\r\nWomen of all classes seemed drawn together by the new tie of\r\ncitizenship.\r\n\r\nThe full returns gave the result as follows: For suffrage, 35,798;\r\nagainst. 29,451; an affirmative majority of 6,347.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhat were the causes of this unique success? First, it may be claimed\r\nthat Western men have more than others of that spirit of chivalry of\r\nwhich the world has heard so much and seen so little. The human mind\r\ninclines to justice, except when turned aside by prejudice, and there\r\nis less prejudice against and a stronger belief in equal rights in the\r\nnewer communities. The pressure of hard times, culminating in the\r\npanic of 1893, undoubtedly contributed to the success of the Populist\r\nparty, and to its influence the suffrage cause owes much. A new party\r\nboldly accepts new principles while the old parties are struggling to\r\nconform to precedents. This is shown clearly in both the legislative\r\nand the popular vote. It was in the counties giving Populist\r\npluralities that the majority of 6,818 in favor of equal suffrage was\r\nfound. The counties which went Republican and Democratic gave a\r\nmajority of 471 against the measure. The fact, however, that in all\r\nparties there were friends who were willing to work and speak for it,\r\nand also the number of suffrage bills which had been introduced at\r\nthis time, showed that the State was ready for it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LAURA A. GREGG.\r\n  Omaha, Neb.\r\n\r\n          MARY WOOD SWIFT.\r\n          San Francisco, Cal.\r\n\r\n      ELLIS MEREDITH.\r\n      Denver, Colo.\r\n\r\n  EMMA SHAFTER HOWARD.\r\n  Oakland, Cal.\r\n\r\n          DR. CORA SMITH EATON.\r\n          Minneapolis, Minn.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nThe favorable influence of the W. C. T. U. and the labor organizations\r\nhas been referred to. There was but little active opposition from\r\nwomen and, as the campaign progressed, indifference often turned into\r\nsympathy. Women who had kept silent even at home for fear of ridicule\r\nwere surprised and delighted to hear their husbands express approval.\r\nThose of all classes of society worked unitedly and well. They could\r\nnot have done this if they had not been used to organized effort in\r\nother directions. How many doors stand open now through which women\r\nfreely pass, unmindful of the fact that they were unlocked by the\r\nearlier workers in the suffrage cause!\r\n\r\nThe first feeling was the one common in all victories, that of joy and\r\nexultation, but the weight of responsibility was soon felt. At the\r\nfirst meeting of the executive board of the equal suffrage association\r\nafter the election, Mrs. Routt, a woman of queenly presence, said as\r\nshe took the hand of another member, \"I never felt so weak in all my\r\nlife.\" Mrs. Routt was the first woman in the State to register.\r\n\r\nIt was natural that other women should look to the suffragists for\r\ndirection, and as long as headquarters were kept open there were\r\nfrequent calls for advice and instruction. Foreign women came to ask\r\nconcerning the measures which would make them naturalized citizens;\r\nthere were inquiries about registration, and the question often came\r\nfrom those in humble life: \"Now that I have received this new right,\r\nwhat books shall I get to teach me how to exercise it?\" Surely such an\r\nawakening of conscience ought to have a purifying effect! One firm in\r\nDenver stated that they sold more books on political economy in the\r\nfirst eight months after the suffrage victory than in twenty years\r\nbefore. The suffrage club took up the study of Fiske's Civil\r\nGovernment and of parliamentary law, and as long as it existed in the\r\nold form was actively devoted to political subjects.\r\n\r\nThe day after the election a German woman came out of her house and\r\naccosted one of the members of the club with the exclamation, \"Ach,\r\nYon he feel so bad; he not vote any more; me, I vote now!\" When\r\nassured that John had not been deprived of any of his rights, with\r\nmore generosity than can be attributed to many of the Johns, she\r\ncalled her husband, exclaiming delightedly: \"Yon, Yon, you vote too;\r\nwe bofe vote!\"\r\n\r\nAFTER THE BATTLE WAS WON: Colorado had always gone Republican in\r\nnational elections until 1892, when the People's Party scored an\r\noverwhelming majority. In 1894, while still partially a unit on\r\nnational issues, the parties were widely separated on State affairs\r\nand each put a ticket in the field.\r\n\r\nThe reign of the Populists was of short duration. The eccentricities\r\nof Gov. Davis H. Waite brought upon his party an unmerited degree of\r\ncensure. The Republicans raised a cry of \"Redeem the State!\" and under\r\nthat motto called to their aid women of former Republican\r\naffiliations. At no subsequent election have women given such close\r\nallegiance to party lines. Mrs. J. Ellen Foster, who was sent by the\r\nNational Republican Committee to canvass the State, probably won many\r\nstraight Republican votes by arousing in the minds of the women the\r\nfear that by attempting to scratch a ticket they might lose their vote\r\nentirely. They have learned since that the Australian ballot is not so\r\nintricate that any one who can read and write need stand in awe of it.\r\n\r\nThe Populist women had formed clubs to assist that party before the\r\nsuffrage was granted. In February, 1894, they opened headquarters in\r\nDenver and began organizing throughout the State. Miss Phoebe W.\r\nCouzins of St. Louis assisted them in this campaign. Mrs. Helen M.\r\nGougar of Indiana worked for the Prohibitionists. When the annual\r\nconvention of the National Republican League Clubs was held at Denver,\r\nin June, the Republican women were as yet unorganized. At this time\r\nMrs. Frank Hall was persuaded to take charge of that department under\r\nthe direction of the State Central Committee. Women's Republican\r\nleagues were established throughout the State, and in the larger towns\r\nand cities complete precinct organizations were effected. In Denver\r\nwomen's Republican clubs were formed in every district and, with their\r\ncommittees subject to the county central committee, worked separately\r\nfrom the men. That known as the East Capitol Hill Women's Republican\r\nLeague, founded by Mrs. H. B. Stevens, acquired a membership of 1,000.\r\nThe East Denver Women's Republican Club, president, Mrs. Alma\r\nLafferty, was equally successful. These were very active in managing\r\nthe large mass meetings which contributed so much to the success of\r\ntheir party.\r\n\r\nThe Democratic women had a peculiar task. Their party was in the\r\nminority and it was divided into Silver Democrats and White Wings\r\n(Cleveland Democrats). The women refused to acknowledge either\r\nfaction. Mrs. Anna Marshall Cochrane and Mrs. Mary C. C. Bradford\r\ncalled a meeting of the Democratic women of Denver at the home of the\r\nlatter in May, 1894, and organized the Colorado Women's Democratic\r\nClub with a membership of nine: President, Mrs. Mary V. Macon;\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Cochrane; treasurer, Mrs. Mary Holland Kincaid. The\r\nNational Committee recognized this as the only straight Democratic\r\nassociation in Colorado, and appointed Mrs. Bradford as organizer. She\r\ncanvassed the State and being a pleasant and convincing speaker and\r\nbringing letters from the chairmen of the two State committees, both\r\nfactions attended her meetings. She formed twelve large women's clubs\r\nand set them to work. When the two State conventions met in Denver,\r\nthey were both quite willing to acknowledge delegates from these\r\nclubs, but the delegates refused to act except with a united\r\nconvention. Mrs. Bradford was nominated as State Superintendent of\r\nPublic Instruction, being the first woman named in Colorado for a\r\nState office. Mrs. Macon was nominated for regent of the State\r\nUniversity. Since there was no chance of electing their ticket, the\r\nprincipal work of the Democratic women in this campaign was the\r\nunifying of the party.\r\n\r\nThe Republicans elected Mrs. Antoinette J. Peavy Superintendent of\r\nPublic Instruction and three women members of the Legislature--Mrs.\r\nClara Cressingham, Mrs. Frances S. Klock and Mrs. Carrie C. Holly.\r\n\r\nDuring this campaign women gained a good deal of insight into\r\npolitical machinery and learned much which dampened their ardor as\r\nparty politicians. The idea began to prevail that at least in\r\nmunicipal government the best results could be attained by\r\nnon-partisan methods.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1895 Mrs. Hall, as vice-chairman of the Republican\r\nState Central, Committee, being in charge of the woman's department,\r\ncalled a conference of the several presidents of the women's\r\nRepublican clubs of Denver. Their object was to purify the ballot and\r\nto overcome corrupt gang rule and present worthy candidates. A meeting\r\nof all the clubs was called in the Broadway Theater and the house was\r\ncrowded. Mrs. E. M. Ashley read an announcement of the objects to be\r\naccomplished \"in the party if they could, out of it if they must.\" At\r\nthis election, for the first time, the _demi-monde_ were compelled to\r\nregister. Desiring to avoid it they sent a petition to this woman's\r\norganization, imploring its interference in their behalf. A committee\r\nof three women of high standing was appointed and appeared before the\r\nFire and Police Board to request that these unfortunates should not be\r\nforced to vote against their will. The board promised compliance but\r\ndisregarded their pledge and those women were compelled to vote.\r\n\r\nIt is no wonder that other organizations sprang up in rebellion\r\nagainst such corrupt methods. The Tax-Payers' Party and the\r\nIndependent Citizens' Movement were examples of these attempts,\r\ndefeated at first but succeeding later. The Civic Federation of\r\nDenver, an outcome of these efforts, is an organization composed of\r\nwomen from all parties, which has endeavored to enforce the selection\r\nof suitable candidates.\r\n\r\nThe Silver Issue of 1896 created a division in the ranks of the\r\nRepublican party which dissolved many of its women's clubs. The larger\r\nwing, under the name of Silver Republican, fused with the other silver\r\nparties and elected their State ticket. Miss Grace Espy Patton, who\r\nhad been prominent in Democratic politics, was chosen State\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction. Three women were elected to the\r\nLower House: Mrs. Olive C. Butler, National Silver Party; Mrs. Martha\r\nA. B. Conine, Non-Partisan; Mrs. Evangeline Heartz, Populist, all of\r\nDenver.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1898 voters were divided between the National\r\nRepublican party under U. S. Senator Edward O. Wolcott and a fusion of\r\nthe Silver Republicans, Democrats and Populists under the leadership\r\nof U. S. Senator Henry M. Teller, Thomas M. Patterson and Charles S.\r\nThomas. In Arapahoe County, owing to various conflicting interests in\r\nthe municipal government of Denver, fifteen tickets were filed. Each\r\nof the principal parties appointed a woman as vice-chairman of the\r\nState Central Committee: National Republican, Mrs. Ione T. Hanna;\r\nSilver Republican, Mrs. Arras Bissel; Democratic, Mrs. S. E. Shields;\r\nPopulist, Mrs. Heartz. A woman's executive committee was formed in\r\neach party.\r\n\r\nThe Fusion party elected Mrs. Helen M. Grenfell, Silver Republican, as\r\nState Superintendent of Public Instruction; and Mrs. Frances S. Lee,\r\nDemocrat, Mrs. Harriet G. R. Wright, Populist, and Dr. Mary F. Barry,\r\nSilver Republican, as members of the House of Representatives.\r\n\r\nConditions in the State changed materially between the Presidential\r\nelections of 1896 and 1900. The depression in the price of silver,\r\nwhich closed many mines and reduced the working force in others, set\r\ncountless men adrift and led to much prospecting and the discovery of\r\nnew gold fields. The mines of Cripple Creek gave Colorado the foremost\r\nplace among gold-producing States, California taking second.\r\nConsequently, although interest in the silver question did not cease,\r\nits pressure was less felt. In 1896 the McKinley Republicans had no\r\nhope of carrying the State, while the Silver Republicans, Populists\r\nand Democrats had united and were confident of the success which\r\nalways had attended a complete fusion of those parties. Thus in both\r\ncases the incentive to the utmost exertion was wanting.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the situation was different. The Republicans thought there was\r\na chance to win and the Fusionists were not over-confident, hence both\r\nparties were stimulated to greater efforts. In 1896 the straight\r\nRepublicans had only one daily and not more than five weekly papers.\r\nIn 1900 they had fifteen daily and 103 weekly papers supporting their\r\nticket. They were thoroughly organized throughout the State. In Denver\r\na Woman's Republican League was formed which vied in size with the\r\norganization of 1894. Mrs. Stanley M. Casper, a most efficient member\r\nof the Equal Suffrage Club in the campaign of 1893, was president;\r\nMrs. A. L. Welch, vice-president and Miss Mary H. Thorn, secretary.\r\nThey organized every district in the city of Denver, appointing women\r\nto look after the registration, secure speakers and get out the vote.\r\nIt was through this league that U. S. Senator Henry Cabot Lodge came\r\nto the State. Mrs. J. Ellen Foster and U. S. Senator J. B. Foraker\r\nalso spoke under their auspices, as well as other distinguished\r\norators, and from their own ranks Mrs. Hanna, Mrs. Lucy R. Scott, Mrs.\r\nPeavey and Mrs. Thalia M. Rhoads.\r\n\r\nThe Colorado Woman's Bryan League were not less active, under the\r\nfollowing officers: Chairman, Mrs. Salena V. Ernest; vice-chairmen,\r\nMesdames Sarah Platt Decker, Katherine A. G. (Thomas M.) Patterson and\r\nMary L. Fletcher; secretary, Mrs. Helen Thomas Belford; treasurer,\r\nMrs. Harriet G. R. Wright.\r\n\r\nBoth organizations kept open headquarters, and the daily papers\r\ncontained long lists of parlor meetings held throughout the city,\r\naddressed by men and women of prominence. The Bryan League was\r\nfortunate in having among its own members many excellent speakers,\r\nincluding Mrs. Decker, Mrs. Patton Cowles, formerly State\r\nSuperintendent of Public Instruction, Dr. Rose Kidd Beare, Mrs.\r\nBradford, Mrs. Dora Phelps Buell and Mrs. Wright. Mrs. Grenfell,\r\npresent State Superintendent, and Mrs. Heartz, now Representative,\r\nboth candidates for re-election, made many speeches.[190]\r\n\r\nThe committees of men and women worked together. On October 27 the\r\nWoman's Bryan League held a rally of the Silver Parties and a\r\nreception to U. S. Senator Teller at the Coliseum. The same evening\r\nthe Woman's Republican League gave a reception to their candidates at\r\nWindsor Hall. Women seem to have an unsuspected gift for managing\r\nlarge meetings. The Denver _Times_ (Republican) said: \"The women have\r\nshown an ability to handle campaigns for which they never were given\r\ncredit in the past.\"\r\n\r\nIn the election of 1900 the Republicans not only lost their electoral\r\nticket but carried fewer counties than they had done for years, yet\r\ntheir vote of 26,000 for McKinley in 1896 was increased to 93,000; and\r\nthe Bryan vote was reduced from 161,000 to 122,700. John F. Shafroth\r\nand John C. Bell, Fusionists, both strong advocates of woman suffrage,\r\nwere elected by large majorities. The Legislature was overwhelmingly\r\nDemocratic, which defeated the re-election to the U. S. Senate of\r\nEdward O. Wolcott, that the women had especially determined upon.\r\nThomas M. Patterson was elected.\r\n\r\nI. N. Stevens, of the _Colorado Springs Gazette_, Republican, in\r\nclosing an article on the State campaign says:\r\n\r\n     The women have demonstrated their effectiveness in political\r\n     campaigns, and wherever party candidates and party politics are\r\n     up to the high standard which they have a right to demand they\r\n     can be counted upon for loyal support. The Republican party in\r\n     Colorado can only hope to triumph in one way and that is by\r\n     appealing to the judgment of the honest and intelligent people of\r\n     the State with clean candidates for commendable policies and\r\n     under worthy leadership.\r\n\r\nThis testimony certainly implies two things, viz.: That the women of\r\nColorado are a power in politics which must be reckoned with, and that\r\ntheir loyal support can be fully counted upon only when the character\r\nof the candidates as well as the political methods and aims of the\r\nparty receive due consideration.\r\n\r\nThe vote at the second presidential election after the suffrage was\r\nconferred on women was as follows:\r\n\r\nPercentage of population in the State: Males, 55; females, 45 (in\r\nround numbers).\r\n\r\nPercentage of vote cast: Males, (nearly) 58-1/2; females, (over)\r\n41-1/2.\r\n\r\nPercentage of vote cast in Denver: Males, 57-1/2; females, 42-1/2.\r\n\r\nThis vote shows that from all causes an average of only three per\r\ncent. of the women in the entire State failed to exercise the\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: The legislation of most importance which is\r\ndirectly due to woman suffrage may be summed up as follows: Equal\r\nguardianship of children; raising the \"age of protection\" for girls\r\nfrom 16 to 18 years; establishment of a State Home for Dependent\r\nChildren; a State Industrial School for Girls; indeterminate sentence\r\nfor criminals; a State Arbitration Board; open meetings of school\r\nboards; the removal of emblems from ballots; placing drinking\r\nfountains on the corners of most of the down-town streets of Denver.\r\n\r\nIndirectly, the results have been infinitely greater. The change in\r\nthe conduct of Denver stores alone, in regard to women employes, is\r\nworthy a chapter. Probably no other city of the same size has more\r\nstores standing upon the so-called White List, and laws which prior to\r\n1893 were dead letters are enforced to-day.\r\n\r\nThe bills introduced by women in the Legislature have been chiefly\r\nsuch as were designed to improve social conditions. The law raising\r\nthe \"age of protection\" for girls, the law giving the mother an equal\r\nright in her children, and the law creating a State Home for Dependent\r\nChildren were secured by women in 1895. In the next session they\r\nsecured the Curfew Law and an appropriation for the State Home for\r\nIncorrigible Girls. By obtaining the removal of the emblems from the\r\nballot, they enforced a measure of educational qualification. They\r\nhave entirely answered the objection that the immature voter would be\r\nsure so to exaggerate the power of legislation that she would try to\r\ndo everything at once.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton said that when she viewed the exhibit of\r\nwoman's work at the Centennial, her heart sank within her; but when\r\nshe bethought her to examine into the part women had had in the work\r\naccredited to men, she took new courage. In like manner much of the\r\nlegislative work women already have done in Colorado is unchronicled.\r\nWhen a woman finds that there are several other bills besides her own\r\nadvocating the same measure of reform, she wisely tries to concentrate\r\nthis effort, even if it is necessary to let the desired bill appear in\r\nthe name of another. Many excellent bills for which they receive no\r\ncredit have run the gauntlet of legislative perils piloted by women.\r\n\r\nA notable instance of this is what was called the Frog-Blocking Bill,\r\nfor the protection of railroad employes, which was introduced by a man\r\nbut so ably engineered by Mrs. Evangeline Heartz that upon its passage\r\nshe received a huge box of candy, with \"The thanks of 5,000 railroad\r\nmen.\" While she introduced a number of bills herself, only two of them\r\nfinally passed--one compelling school boards to hold open meetings\r\ninstead of Star Chamber sessions, and the present law providing for a\r\nState Board of Arbitration. In order to make the latter effective it\r\nshould have a compulsory clause, which she will strive for in the\r\nLegislature of 1901.\r\n\r\nLAWS: While the laws of Colorado always have been liberal to women in\r\nmany respects, there are a few notable exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe first Legislature of the Territory, in 1861, passed a bill to the\r\neffect that either party to the marriage contract might dispose of\r\nproperty without the signature or consent of the other. The men of\r\nthis new mining country often had left their wives thousands of miles\r\naway in the Eastern States; there was no railroad or telegraph; mining\r\nclaims, being real estate, had to be transferred by deed, often in a\r\nhurry, and this law was largely a necessity. It now works great\r\ninjustice to women, however, through the fact that all the property\r\naccumulated after marriage belongs to the husband and he may legally\r\ndispose of it without the wife's knowledge, leaving her penniless.\r\nEven the household goods may be thus disposed of.[191]\r\n\r\nA law of recent years exempts from execution a homestead to the value\r\nof $2,000 for \"the head of the family,\" but even this can be sold by\r\nthe husband without the wife's signature, although he can not mortgage\r\nit. This property must be designated as a \"homestead\" on the margin of\r\nthe recorded title, and it must be occupied by the owner. \"A woman\r\noccupying her own property as the home of the family has the right to\r\ndesignate it as a homestead. The husband has the legal right to live\r\nwith her and enjoy the homestead he has settled upon her.\"(!) He has,\r\nhowever, the sole right to determine the residence of the family, as\r\nin every other State, and by removing from a property the homestead\r\nright is destroyed. If the husband abandon the wife and acquire a\r\nhomestead elsewhere, she has a right only in that.\r\n\r\nNeither curtesy nor dower obtains. The surviving husband or wife, if\r\nthere are children or the descendants of children living, receives,\r\nsubject to the payment of debts, one-half of the entire estate, real\r\nand personal. If there is no living child nor a descendant of any\r\nchild, the entire estate goes to the survivor.\r\n\r\nHusband and wife have the same rights in making wills. Each can will\r\naway from the other half of his or her separate property.\r\n\r\nIn buying and selling, making contracts, suing and being sued, the\r\nmarried woman has the same rights as the unmarried.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 fathers and mothers were made joint guardians of the children\r\nwith equal powers.\r\n\r\nThe expenses of the family and the education of the children are\r\nchargeable upon the property of both husband and wife, or either of\r\nthem, and in relation thereto they may be sued jointly or separately.\r\n\r\nIn case a man fails to support his family, he can be compelled to do\r\nso on the complaint of the wife, the chairman of the board of county\r\ncommissioners, or the agent of the humane society. Unless he show\r\nphysical incapacity, or some other good reason for this failure, he\r\nmay be committed to jail for sixty days.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 16 years in\r\n1891; from 16 to 18 in 1895. The penalty is confinement in the\r\npenitentiary not less than one nor more than twenty years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: School Suffrage was granted to women by the constitution in\r\n1876, the year Colorado became a State.\r\n\r\nThe amendment to the constitution adopted by 6,347 majority, Nov. 7,\r\n1893, is as follows:\r\n\r\n     Every female person shall be entitled to vote at all elections,\r\n     in the same manner in all respects as male persons are or shall\r\n     be entitled to vote by the constitution and laws of this State,\r\n     and the same qualifications as to age, citizenship and time of\r\n     residence in the State, county, city, ward and precinct, and all\r\n     other qualifications required by law to entitle male persons to\r\n     vote, shall be required to entitle female persons to vote.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Possessing the Full Suffrage, women of course are\r\neligible to all offices, but naturally the men will not surrender them\r\nunless compelled to do so. That of State Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction is generally conceded by all parties as belonging to a\r\nwoman, and no man has been a candidate for this office since 1893. It\r\ncan best be spared, as it does not encourage idleness or enable its\r\nholder to amass wealth.\r\n\r\nBeginning with 1895 ten women have been elected to the Lower House of\r\nthe Legislature but none to the Senate. Not more than three have been\r\nmembers during any one term.\r\n\r\nOnly two women were elected to State offices in 1900. The others\r\nholding office at present are as follows: County school\r\nsuperintendents, 29; school directors, 508; county clerk, one; county\r\ntreasurer, one; assessor, one; clerk of County Court, one; clerk of\r\nDistrict Court, one. Of the county superintendents, three were elected\r\nby a fusion of Democrats and Prohibitionists, three by Democrats,\r\nProhibitionists and Silver Republicans; ten by Democrats and thirteen\r\nby Republicans.\r\n\r\nThe State Board of Charities and Corrections, which has general\r\nsupervision over all the charitable and penal institutions, has had\r\nMrs. Sarah Platt Decker for its president through this and previous\r\nadministrations. Dr. Eleanor Lawney also is on this board. On the\r\nboard of control of the State Industrial School for Girls, three out\r\nof five members are women; State Home for Dependent Children, four out\r\nof five; State School for Deaf and Blind, one out of five; State\r\nNormal School, two out of seven; State Board of Horticulture, one out\r\nof six. There have been women on the State Board of Pardons.\r\n\r\nThere are women physicians in the State Insane Asylum and connected\r\nwith all institutions containing women and children.\r\n\r\nThe law for jurors is construed by the judges to apply equally to men\r\nand women, but thus far it has been so manipulated that no women have\r\nbeen drawn for service.\r\n\r\nIn 1897-98 two counties had women coroners.\r\n\r\nThere are eight women clerks in the Senate and seven in the House of\r\nthe present Legislature. A number are employed in the court-house and\r\nin the county offices.\r\n\r\nThis partition of offices does not appear very liberal, considering\r\nthat women have cast as high as 52 per cent. of the total vote; but\r\nthere are in the State 30,000 more men than women, who could vote if\r\nthey chose, and they are much more accustomed to holding offices and\r\nmuch more anxious to get them. The less the probabilities of election,\r\nthe more liberal the parties have been in granting nominations to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: The only occupation legally forbidden to women is that of\r\nworking in mines. Children under fourteen can not be employed,\r\nlegally, in mines, factories, stores, etc.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All the institutions of learning are open alike to both\r\nsexes. There are five women on the faculty of the State University,\r\none on that of the School of Agriculture, nine in the State Normal\r\nSchool, and in the State Institute for Deaf Mutes seventeen of the\r\nthirty-three teachers are women. The Medical Department of the\r\nUniversity of Denver has three women professors.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 727 men and 2,557 women teachers. The\r\naverage monthly salary of the men is $67; of the women, $48.42.\r\nColorado spends a larger amount per capita for public school education\r\nthan any other State.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOn June 29, 30, 1894, a general meeting of Colorado suffragists was\r\nheld in Denver and a reorganization of the State association effected.\r\nThe reason for its continuance was the desire to help other States in\r\ntheir efforts to win the franchise, and a feeling of loyalty to the\r\nNational Association, to which in common with all other women those of\r\nColorado owed so much.\r\n\r\nIn May 1895, Miss Susan B. Anthony, president of the National\r\nAssociation, and the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, vice-president at large,\r\non their way to California, addressed a large and delighted audience\r\nin the Broadway Theater, and a reception was given them by the Woman's\r\nClub.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the Colorado E. S. A. raised the funds to send Mrs. Mary C. C.\r\nBradford to aid in the Idaho amendment campaign.\r\n\r\nDuring the Biennial of the General Federation of Women's Clubs, held\r\nin Denver in June, 1898, the E. S. A. celebrated the Jubilee\r\nAnniversary of the first Woman's Rights Convention at Seneca Falls, N.\r\nY., by a meeting in the Auditorium and a reception in the parlors of\r\nthe Central Christian Church, with addresses by eminent local and\r\nvisiting speakers. In these rooms, for the entire week, this\r\norganization and the Civic Federation kept open house, and in a\r\nflag-draped booth gave an illustration of the Australian system of\r\nvoting.[192]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1899, Denver entertained Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\nchairman of the national organization committee, and Miss Mary G. Hay,\r\nsecretary, as they were passing through the State. Mrs. A. L. Welch\r\ngave a reception in their honor, at which ex-Gov. Charles S. Thomas\r\nand Gov. Alva Adams spoke enthusiastically of the results of equal\r\nsuffrage, followed by Mrs. Chapman Catt in an interesting address. The\r\noccasion was especially happy because that day the Legislature had\r\nalmost unanimously passed a joint resolution as follows:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Equal suffrage has been in operation in Colorado for\r\n     five years, during which time women have exercised the privilege\r\n     as generally as men, with the result that better candidates have\r\n     been selected for office, methods of election have been purified,\r\n     the character of legislation improved, civic intelligence\r\n     increased and womanhood developed to greater usefulness by\r\n     political responsibility; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, by the House of Representatives, the Senate\r\n     concurring, That in view of these results the enfranchisement of\r\n     women in every State and Territory of the American Union is\r\n     hereby recommended as a measure tending to the advancement of a\r\n     higher and better social order.\r\n\r\n     That an authenticated copy of these resolutions be forwarded by\r\n     the Governor of the State to the Legislature of every State and\r\n     Territory, and the press be requested to call public attention to\r\n     them.[193]\r\n\r\nThis year Mrs. Katherine A. G. Patterson, who had been president of\r\nthe State E. S. A. for three years, retired and was succeeded by Mrs.\r\nWelch, who was followed in 1900 by Mrs. Amy K. Cornwall, and in 1901\r\nby Prof. Theodosia G. Ammons.\r\n\r\nOne of the uncongenial tasks of the officers of the association has\r\nbeen the answering of the many attacks made in Eastern papers on the\r\nposition of women in Colorado, though this becomes far less trying\r\nwhen it is remembered that in most States public opinion on the\r\nquestion of woman suffrage is still in its formative stage. So soon do\r\nwe become accustomed to a new thing, if it is in the order of nature,\r\nthat the women of Colorado have almost ceased to realize that they\r\npossess an uncommon privilege. It seems as much a matter of course\r\nthat women should vote as that they should enjoy the right of free\r\nspeech or the protection of the _habeas corpus_ act. It is seldom\r\ndefended, for the same reason that it is no longer thought necessary\r\nto defend the Copernican vs. the Ptolemaic theory. One aim of the\r\nassociation is to arouse a more altruistic spirit, and another so to\r\nunite women that they will stand together for a good cause\r\nirrespective of party. There is at present a strong legislative\r\ncommittee which has been studying the statutes from a non-partisan\r\nstandpoint, with a view to influencing needful legislation.[194]\r\n\r\nBefore the autumn of 1893 there were many clubs in Denver, mostly of a\r\nliterary nature, each formed of women of a certain rank in life, with\r\nsimilar tastes and pursuits. Some had a membership so limited as to\r\nrender them very difficult of access, but in their way all were good.\r\nPerhaps the only truly democratic association, if those of the\r\nchurches were excepted, where the rich and the poor met together on a\r\nplane so perfectly level that only mental or moral height in the\r\nindividual produced any difference, was the equal suffrage club.\r\nWhether related to it or not, this new ideal of club life followed\r\nclosely after the gaining of political equality.\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Club of Denver was organized April 21, 1894, with 225\r\ncharter members, and now has nearly 1,000. It contains many women of\r\nwealth and high social standing, many quiet housekeepers without the\r\nslightest aspirations toward fashionable life, and many women who earn\r\ntheir daily bread by some trade or profession. What the public school\r\nis supposed to do for our youth in helping us to become a homogeneous\r\nnation, the modern woman's club is doing for those of maturer years.\r\nThe North Side Woman's Club of Denver is second to the Woman's Club\r\nonly in size and time of organization. The Colorado Federation of\r\nWomen's Clubs was formed April 5, 1895, with a charter membership of\r\nthirty-seven. It now is composed of over 100 clubs, containing about\r\n4,000 individuals.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThis is merely a plain tale from the hills. Colorado women feel that\r\nthey have done well but have made only a beginning. The fact that\r\nwomen are factors in politics underlies and overrules many things not\r\ndirectly connected with the results of election day. Many of the dire\r\neffects predicted of equal suffrage have proved their prophets false.\r\nIn some cases the women themselves have been surprised to find they\r\nhad entertained groundless fears. This is particularly true concerning\r\nthe fierce partisanship which is supposed to run riot in the female\r\nnature. There is a strong tendency on the part of women to stand by\r\neach other, though not always to the extent evinced by one lady who\r\nwas and still is a pronounced \"anti.\" At the first election she voted\r\nfor every woman placed in nomination for the Legislature, Populist,\r\nDemocrat, Republican and Prohibitionist, until she had filled out her\r\nticket. Women frequently scratch their ballots when by so doing they\r\ncan elect a better man. In legislative work there are absolutely no\r\nparty lines. The Republican and the Democratic women both want the\r\nsame measures, and they look upon themselves as constituents whether\r\nthe member belongs to their party or not.\r\n\r\nThe vote of the _demi-monde_ always has been a stumbling-block to\r\ncertain particularly good people. These women never register, never\r\nvote and never attend primaries except when compelled to do so. Their\r\nidentity is often a secret even to their closest associates. It is\r\nalmost impossible to learn their true names. All they ask is to be let\r\nalone. Unfortunately the city of Denver is under what is known as the\r\nMetropolitan Fire and Police System. The firemen and police are\r\ncontrolled by boards appointed by the Governor. If he is a politically\r\nscrupulous man and his appointments are good ones, this class is not\r\nmolested. Gov. Davis H. Waite did not compel these women to vote for\r\nhim in 1894, though he had the power. Under the administration of\r\nGovernor Adams, when the Hon. Ralph Talbot was president of the board,\r\nthey took no part whatever.\r\n\r\nPossibly those who have been most disappointed at the workings of\r\nequal suffrage are the Prohibitionists, yet they really have reason\r\nfor congratulation. Weld County, which gave the largest vote for equal\r\nsuffrage of any in the State, has excluded liquor from its borders\r\nexcept in one small town, a coal mining camp with a heavy foreign\r\nvote. In many sections the liquor traffic has been abolished, always\r\nby the votes of women, but there are many more men than women in the\r\nState and without their co-operation no general reform can be enacted\r\nor enforced. Every political party has banished liquor and tobacco\r\nfrom its headquarters, as desiring to win the women's support they are\r\ncareful not to give offense. On election days Denver has a holiday\r\nappearance. The vote is cast early and the members of a family usually\r\ngo together to the polls.\r\n\r\nThe most noteworthy result is the improved character of the\r\ncandidates, as one of the most important points to be considered is\r\nwhether they can get the votes of women. The addition of a large\r\nnumber of independent and conscientious voters to the electorate; the\r\nwider outlook given to woman herself through the exercise of civic\r\nrights; and the higher degree of comradeship made possible by the\r\nremoval of political inequality between man and woman; these are the\r\ngreatest benefits which equal suffrage has brought to Colorado.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[188] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Emily R.\r\nMeredith and her daughter, Ellis Meredith of Denver, both strong\r\nfactors in securing suffrage for the women of their State; the latter\r\nis on the staff of the _Rocky Mountain News_ and editor of the\r\n_Western Clubwoman_.\r\n\r\n[189] In 1900 Mr. Bonynge was a candidate for Congress on the\r\nRepublican ticket and was overwhelmingly defeated by the votes of\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\n[190] Mrs. Grenfell was re-elected on the Fusion ticket, having been\r\nindorsed by the heads of all the State institutions, most of the\r\ncounty superintendents and all the prominent educators. The\r\nRepublicans had a woman candidate for this office. Mrs. Heartz was\r\nre-elected on the Fusion ticket. There was a Republican woman\r\ncandidate for the Legislature also.\r\n\r\n[191] A bill was introduced in the Legislature of 1901 to give the\r\nwife a half-interest in all the earnings after marriage, but it failed\r\nto pass either House, perhaps owing to the time consumed by the\r\nimportant revenue bill.\r\n\r\n[192] Governor Adams did a splendid work for equal suffrage in his\r\nwelcome to this great body of women. Quite unaware that it was a\r\ntabooed subject, he made a most eloquent address openly glorying in it\r\nand advocating its wholesale extension. Probably no one act of his\r\nadministration made him so many friends among women, and it is said\r\nthat scores of those from other States went home thoroughly converted.\r\n\r\n[193] See Appendix--Testimony from Woman Suffrage States.\r\n\r\n[194] The Legislature of 1901 passed 116 bills, a number being of\r\nspecial interest to women. Among these was one establishing truancy\r\nschools; another for the care of the feeble-minded; several humane\r\nsociety bills; a measure permitting the State Board of Charities and\r\nCorrections to investigate private charitable institutions; a bill for\r\nan eight-hour day; one for the preservation of forest trees; one for a\r\nbi-weekly pay-day, and an Insurance Bill providing that in cases where\r\na company has to be sued for the amount of a policy it must pay the\r\ncosts of said suit. This last was indorsed by nearly every woman's\r\norganization in the State. The Eight Hour Law requires a\r\nconstitutional amendment, and will be voted on in the fall of 1902.\r\nThis is also true of a bill consolidating and reducing the number of\r\nelections, and of one providing for full citizenship and an\r\neducational qualification as requisites for suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXX.\r\n\r\nCONNECTICUT.[195]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Connecticut Woman Suffrage Association was organized in September,\r\n1869, after a memorable two days' convention in Hartford, under the\r\ncall and management of Mrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker,[196] The Rev.\r\nNathaniel J. Burton, D. D., was elected its first president and in\r\n1871 he was succeeded by Mrs. Hooker, who has now held the office\r\nthirty years with unswerving loyalty and devotion to the cause. During\r\nthe first fifteen years eight conventions were held, addressed by the\r\nmost prominent speakers in the country.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 a State convention took place in Hartford, attended by Miss\r\nSusan B. Anthony and a large delegation of men and women from various\r\nparts of the State. But one other (1888) intervened between this and\r\nthat which met in Meriden in 1892, when the society was reorganized\r\nunder a broader constitution, with the name of Connecticut\r\nWoman Suffrage Society for the Study of Political Science.\r\nMrs. Hooker was made president and Mrs. Elizabeth D. Bacon\r\nvice-president-at-large.[197]\r\n\r\nSince then annual conventions have been held in Hartford (four),\r\nMeriden, Willimantic and Southington. Several executive meetings have\r\nbeen called yearly and the business of the association has been\r\nsystematically arranged. Public meetings have been addressed by Miss\r\nAnthony, president of the National Association, Mrs. Carrie Chapman\r\nCatt, chairman of its organization committee, Mrs. Mary Seymour\r\nHowell of New York, Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates of Maine and many\r\nothers.[198]\r\n\r\nThe Hartford Equal Rights Club was organized in 1885 through the\r\nefforts of Mrs. Emily P. Collins and Miss Frances Ellen Burr, both\r\npioneers in the work. Located in the capital, it is the center of the\r\neffort for the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\nThe Meriden Political Equality Club was formed in 1889. The late Hon.\r\nIsaac C. Lewis, one of its charter members and a lover of justice and\r\nequality, in 1893 gave $10,000 in invested funds to aid its work. The\r\nEqual Rights Club of Willimantic, founded in 1894, is an active body.\r\n\r\nA series of public meetings was held in 1892 at Seymour, Willimantic,\r\nWinsted and Ansonia, arranged and financially supported by the Meriden\r\nClub and addressed by Mrs. Howell.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, under the auspices of the State society, a course of twenty\r\nlectures was arranged by Mrs. Bacon for Miss Yates.\r\n\r\nThe local clubs have kept the question before the people through\r\naddresses, the circulation of literature and other methods of\r\npropaganda. For several years a suffrage tent was supported at the\r\nState Fair held in Meriden, and one day set apart as Woman's Day, with\r\ngood speakers to present the subject. The press department has been an\r\nimportant feature of the work, most efficiently conducted by Mrs. Ella\r\nB. Kendrick, its superintendent for the past three years.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: Women have been instrumental in securing\r\nthe passage of laws prohibiting the sale of tobacco in any form to\r\nboys under sixteen years of age; compelling merchants to provide women\r\nand girls in their employment with seats when not engaged in their\r\nduties; securing scientific temperance instruction in the public\r\nschools; and requiring a police matron in all cities of 20,000 or more\r\ninhabitants.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 a bill giving women the right to vote in school district\r\nmeetings was rejected in the House by 83 ayes, 95 noes, and in the\r\nSenate by a majority vote.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 a bill for School Suffrage was rejected by both Houses.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 a bill for Full Suffrage was defeated in both Houses.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 two bills were introduced, one asking Full Suffrage and the\r\nother that unmarried women be exempt from taxation. In both cases the\r\ncommittee reported \"Ought not to pass,\" and the petitioners were given\r\nleave to withdraw. At this session women were made eligible to serve\r\nas School Trustees.\r\n\r\nThis year the annual sessions were changed to biennial.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the petitions for Full Suffrage of Mrs. Elizabeth D. Bacon and\r\nothers were indefinitely postponed. During the same session women were\r\nmade eligible to hold the office of assistant town clerk, and to\r\nbecome members of ecclesiastical societies.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 a legal dispute as to the result of a gubernatorial election\r\ncaused the former Governor to hold over, and all legislative business\r\nto be postponed for two years.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the committee, after giving several hearings upon a bill\r\nasking Full Suffrage, substituted, with the consent of the State\r\nassociation, one for School Suffrage. Upon the third reading this\r\npassed the House, but the Senate referred it back to the committee as\r\nimperfect. There it would have remained but for the efforts of the\r\nHartford Equal Rights Club. It finally passed the Senate and the\r\nHouse, was signed by Gov. Luzon B. Morris and became law. Several\r\nattempts have been made to repeal it but unsuccessfully.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 a bill providing for the right of women to vote for\r\nPresidential electors was reported unfavorably by the committee, the\r\nreport being accepted. The same year a Municipal Suffrage Bill went to\r\na third reading and was passed by the House, but failed in the Senate\r\nby unanimous vote.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 a bill conferring upon women the right to vote for\r\nPresidential electors was rejected after a third reading both in the\r\nHouse and Senate. Another was presented for the exemption of women\r\nfrom taxation, the committee reported, \"Ought not to pass,\" and the\r\nreport was accepted. A bill for Municipal Suffrage met the same fate.\r\nThis year a bill was introduced at the request of the Hartford club,\r\ncreating the office of woman factory inspector, with the same salary\r\nas the male inspector. The Judiciary Committee reported unanimously in\r\nfavor. Great opposition developed in the House, but after some\r\namendments it passed, but failed in the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 a Municipal Suffrage Bill was again introduced and reported\r\nupon favorably, but on the third reading it was rejected in the House,\r\nand defeated by 9 ayes, 12 noes in the Senate. A bill also was\r\npresented providing that any woman who pays taxes on real estate\r\nwherein she resides may vote at any meeting upon questions of taxation\r\nor appropriation of money. This passed the House, but was rejected in\r\nthe Senate. The House refused to concur, and the Senate adhered to its\r\nformer action.\r\n\r\nThere have been hearings before the Judiciary Committees of several\r\nLegislatures for the purpose of securing a Reformatory for Women.\r\nMembers of the Woman's Aid Society of Hartford and others equally\r\ninterested have appeared in its behalf.\r\n\r\nThe law regarding the property rights of women upon the statute books\r\nof to-day, except one amendment, was passed in April, 1877, and reads\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n     In case of marriage on or after April 20, 1877, neither husband\r\n     nor wife shall acquire, by force of marriage, any right to or\r\n     interest in any property held by the other before, or acquired\r\n     after such marriage, except as to the share of the survivor in\r\n     the property as provided by law. The separate earnings of the\r\n     wife shall be her sole property. She shall have power to make\r\n     contracts with third persons and to convey to them her real\r\n     estate, as if unmarried. Her property shall be liable to be taken\r\n     for her debts except when exempt from execution, but in no case\r\n     shall be liable to be taken for the debts of her husband. And the\r\n     husband shall not be liable for her debts contracted before her\r\n     marriage, nor upon contracts made after her marriage, except as\r\n     provided by the succeeding sections.\r\n\r\n     The dower rights of women married before this date are: A life\r\n     estate in one-third the husband's realty and one-half his\r\n     personalty absolutely, unless they shall have made together with\r\n     their husbands a written contract and recorded the same in the\r\n     Probate Records, in which they mutually agree to abandon their\r\n     respective common-law rights in the property of each other, and\r\n     to claim in place thereof certain other rights as provided by\r\n     statute made in 1877 as below. The husband before that date took\r\n     the whole of the wife's personal estate absolutely and the use\r\n     for life of all her real estate.\r\n\r\n     Women married on or after April 20, 1877, and those married\r\n     earlier, who have made and recorded contracts with their husbands\r\n     as above stated, have no dower rights, and their husbands have no\r\n     rights by curtesy, but both have, in place of these, rights more\r\n     valuable.\r\n\r\n     Where there are children, the survivor is entitled to one-third\r\n     of decedent's real and personal estate absolutely, and in the\r\n     absence of children, takes all of the decedent's estate\r\n     absolutely to the extent of $2,000, and one-half of the remainder\r\n     absolutely after the decedent's debts have been paid.\r\n\r\nThe father always has been entitled to the custody and control of the\r\nminor children with power to appoint a guardian by will; but a law was\r\npassed the present year (1901) which gives the father and mother equal\r\nrights of guardianship, and on the death of the father makes the\r\nmother the legal guardian.\r\n\r\nIf a husband neglect to support his wife he may be committed to the\r\nworkhouse or county jail and sentenced to hard labor not more than\r\nsixty days, unless he can show good cause why he is unable to furnish\r\nsuch support, or unless he can give a bond. If he neglect to comply\r\nwith his bond the selectmen of the town shall immediately furnish\r\nsupport to the extent provided for in such bond. (1895.)\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 14\r\nyears, and in 1895 this was increased to 16. The penalty is\r\nimprisonment in the penitentiary not less than three years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: The School Suffrage Law of 1893 allows all women citizens\r\nwho have arrived at the age of majority, and have resided one year in\r\nthe State and six months in the town, to vote at any meeting held for\r\nelection of school trustees or for any educational purpose.\r\n\r\nAt the first election after the passage of this Act, 4,471 women voted\r\nin the State. Since then the number has gradually decreased for\r\nseveral reasons. Women soon learned that their vote amounted to but\r\nlittle because of the fact that Connecticut has a minority\r\nrepresentation upon its school boards. This practically eliminates\r\ncontest in the election of school officers, for it often occurs that\r\nonly the exact number of candidates to be elected are placed in\r\nnomination. In cities men are frequently placed on school boards to\r\npay political debts or as an opening for further advancement,\r\ntherefore it has been found almost impossible to secure the nomination\r\nof women. This, of course, decreases their interest in the election.\r\nIn several marked instances, however, where some question of\r\nimportance has arisen, women have registered and voted in large\r\nnumbers.\r\n\r\nWillimantic offers a good illustration. All the schools in the town of\r\nWindham, of which Willimantic is a borough, were under the district\r\nsystem. For some time the largest school district had been unwisely\r\nmanaged through the influence of one man, who controlled enough votes\r\nto insure his retention as chairman year after year. In June, 1895,\r\nwhen he had entirely forfeited confidence, Mrs. Ella L. Bennett,\r\npresident, and other wide awake members of the Equal Rights Club,\r\ndetermined he should no longer hold this office. The best citizens\r\nassured the women that their fears of his re-election were groundless,\r\nbut they kept on in their efforts and secured the attendance of fifty\r\nwomen at the district meeting, where he was defeated by about twenty\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nThe level-headed ones saw that consolidation of all the school\r\ndistricts was absolutely necessary. Before the election in October the\r\nwomen did valiant work in agitating this question. Previous to this\r\nnot more than 200 women ever had voted; but now the number registered\r\nreached 1,129, and on election day, although the rain fell in torrents\r\nand rivers of water ran down the streets, 975 cast their ballots. The\r\nEqual Rights Club conducted the election so far as the women were\r\nconcerned, assisted in preparing ballots, kept a check-list and sent\r\ncarriages where it seemed necessary. Every little while, all day long,\r\ncould be heard from the hall where the voting was going on, \"Fall\r\nback, ladies, fall back and give the men a chance.\" At the noon hour a\r\ncrowd of male voters saw a line of women coming down the street and,\r\nseizing a ladder, they set it against a window over the stairway,\r\nscrambled up and thus got into the hall and headed off the women until\r\nthe men had voted. The measure for consolidation was carried.\r\n\r\nIn Hartford the question of consolidation of districts has twice come\r\nbefore the people since women voted, and in both instances they cast a\r\nlarge number of ballots. In several districts in this city women have\r\nshown much interest in the annual meetings. One woman has served three\r\nyears upon a district committee very acceptably, and it is due to the\r\nefforts and votes of women that wise management has been sustained and\r\na good principal kept in office.\r\n\r\nIn his report of 1896, Secretary Charles D. Hine of the State Board of\r\nEducation, after speaking in unmeasured terms of the efficient\r\nservice rendered by women as school visitors, on boards of education\r\nand on town and district committees, says:\r\n\r\n     The returns indicate that women are not anxious to vote upon\r\n     educational matters alone. If men were reluctantly permitted as a\r\n     great favor to vote for agent of the town-deposit fund, they\r\n     would not swarm to the polls. The exciting interests of State\r\n     elections are important and varied enough to allure 85 per cent.\r\n     of the male voters to the polls, but in many districts it is\r\n     difficult to obtain enough of them to transact the business of\r\n     the annual meeting. In the largest district in the State, school\r\n     meetings have been held and considerable sums of money voted,\r\n     with less than a dozen men present. Woman can not be adjudged\r\n     peculiarly lacking in interest because they are not found voting\r\n     in large numbers on one question and one set of officers.[199]\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the Legislature amended the School Suffrage Law. The women\r\nbelieved that this change was effected to make the process of becoming\r\na voter more disagreeable. Heretofore they had been permitted to go at\r\nany time before the town clerk, answer the necessary questions and be\r\nregistered. The amendment required them to observe the same\r\nregulations as the men who have the full franchise. They must make\r\napplication to the registrar at one fixed time, fill out a blank and\r\nhave their names published in the newspapers in the list of those who\r\nwish to be made voters. Then at another fixed time they must go before\r\nthe selectmen, await their turn, take the necessary oath, etc. In many\r\ntowns and cities it was ruled that all who had been made voters under\r\nthe old law must re-register. Feeling the injustice of this, many\r\nwomen refused. In Hartford they rebelled absolutely, and after much\r\ndiscussion in the papers and otherwise the city attorney decided that\r\nthe law was not retroactive.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Since 1887 women have been eligible as school\r\ntrustees, and at present 45 are serving, of whom 29 are school\r\nvisitors. The latter prescribe rules for the management,\r\nclassification, studies and discipline of the public schools. The old\r\nschool district system prevails in many cities and towns and there are\r\na dozen or more women on district committees.\r\n\r\nWomen are filling other offices, elective and appointive, as follows:\r\nPublic librarians, 27; police matrons, 5; matron of the State\r\nHospital for the Insane, one; matrons of Reform School for Boys, six,\r\nand one assistant; visiting committee of State Industrial School for\r\nGirls, 12, two acting each month; assistant superintendent for same,\r\none; in each of the eight Homes connected with this school are to be\r\nfound a matron and an assistant.\r\n\r\nTwo of the five members of the State Board of Charities must be women.\r\n\r\nWomen may serve as notaries public and forty-two are now doing so.\r\nThey are eligible as assistant town clerks.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is forbidden to women by law.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Wesleyan University, in Middletown, admitted women to equal\r\nprivileges with men in 1872. By a vote of the trustees in 1900 the\r\nnumber of women was limited to 20 per cent. of the total number of\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the Theological Seminary (Cong'l) of Hartford admitted women\r\nupon the same terms as men.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 Yale University opened the courses of the post-graduate\r\ndepartment, with the degree of Ph. D. to women.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, by an Act of the Legislature, the State Agricultural School,\r\nat Storrs, admitted women to its full course.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 387 men and 3,692 women teachers. The\r\naverage monthly salary of the men is $89.87; of the women, $43.61.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe State Federation of Women's Clubs was organized in 1897 and under\r\nits auspices traveling libraries have been formed for rural schools,\r\nfree kindergartens supported, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Society of Colonial Dames has loaned to the library committee\r\ntwenty libraries which have been placed in public schools.\r\n\r\nThe Civic Club of Hartford, organized in 1895 with a membership of 150\r\nwomen, has been instrumental in securing greater cleanliness of\r\nstreets and public places. It has raised $3,000 for the support of\r\nvacation schools, for three years, and has instituted plans for public\r\nplaygrounds.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the Home for Incurable Children was founded by the Children's\r\nAid Society, entirely the work of women.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[195] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Elizabeth D.\r\nBacon of Hartford, vice-president-at-large of the State Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n[196] See History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. III, p. 321.\r\n\r\n[197] County vice-presidents, Mesdames Ella B.

Leon and Mrs. Susan\r\nJ. Cheney. Honorable mention might be made of many others who have\r\nspent time and money without stint in efforts to advance this cause.\r\n\r\n[199] In 1902 a revised State constitution was submitted and only 15\r\nper cent. of the electors voted on it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXI.\r\n\r\nDAKOTA.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Territory of Dakota was created in 1861, but in 1889 it entered\r\nthe Union divided into two separate States, North and South Dakota. As\r\nearly as 1872 the Territorial Legislature lacked only one vote of\r\nconferring the full suffrage on women. The sparsely settled country\r\nand the long distances made any organized work an impossibility,\r\nalthough a number of individuals were strong advocates of equal\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 it gave women the right to vote at school meetings. In 1883 a\r\nschool township law was passed requiring regular polls and a private\r\nballot instead of special meetings, which took away the suffrage from\r\nwomen in all but a few counties.\r\n\r\nAt the convening of the Territorial Legislature in January, 1885,\r\nMajor J. A. Pickler (afterward member of Congress), without\r\nsolicitation early in the session introduced a bill in the House\r\ngranting Full Suffrage to women, as under the organic act the\r\nlegislative body had the power to describe the qualifications for the\r\nfranchise. The bill passed the House, February 11, by 29 ayes, 19\r\nnoes. Soon afterward it passed the Council by 14 ayes, 10 noes, and\r\nits friends counted the victory won. But Gov. Gilbert A. Pierce,\r\nappointed by President Arthur and only a few months in the Territory,\r\nfailed to recognize the grand opportunity to enfranchise 50,000\r\nAmerican citizens by one stroke of his pen and vetoed the bill. Not\r\nonly did it express the sentiment of the representatives elected by\r\nthe voters, but it had been generally discussed by the press of the\r\nTerritory, and all the newspapers but one were outspoken for it. An\r\neffort was made to carry it over the Governor's veto, but it failed.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 a law was passed enlarging the School Suffrage possessed by\r\nwomen and giving them the right to vote at all school elections and\r\nfor all school officers, and also making them eligible to any\r\nelective school office. At this time, under the liberal provisions of\r\nthe United States Land Laws, more than one-third of the land in the\r\nTerritory was held by women.\r\n\r\nIn this same Legislature of 1887 another effort was made to pass an\r\nEqual Suffrage Bill, and a committee from the franchise department of\r\nthe Woman's Christian Temperance Union, consisting of Mesdames Helen\r\nM. Barker, S. V. Wilson and Alice M. A. Pickler, appeared before the\r\ncommittee and presented hundreds of petitions from the men and women\r\nof the Territory. The committees of both Houses reported favorably,\r\nbut the bill failed by 13 votes in the House and 6 in the Council.\r\n\r\nIt was mainly through women's instrumentality that a local option bill\r\nwas carried through this Legislature, and largely through their\r\nexertions that it was adopted by sixty-five out of the eighty-seven\r\norganized counties at the next general election.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1885, the American Woman Suffrage Association held a\r\nnational convention in Minneapolis, Minn., which was attended by a\r\nnumber of people from Dakota, who were greatly interested. The next\r\nmonth the first suffrage club was formed, in Webster. Several local\r\nsocieties were afterwards started in the southern part of the\r\nTerritory, but for five years no attempt was made at bringing these\r\ntogether in a convention.[200]\r\n\r\nThe long contention as to whether the Territory should come into the\r\nUnion as one State or two was not decided until 1889, when Congress\r\nadmitted two States. Thenceforth there were two distinct movements for\r\nwoman suffrage, one in North and one in South Dakota.\r\n\r\n\r\nNORTH DAKOTA.[201]\r\n\r\nOn July 4, 1889, a convention met at Bismarck to prepare a\r\nconstitution for the admission of North Dakota as a State. As similar\r\nconventions were to be held in several other Territories, Henry B.\r\nBlackwell, editor of the _Woman's Journal_, came from Boston in the\r\ninterest of woman suffrage. His object was to have it embodied in the\r\nconstitution if possible, but failing in this he endeavored to have\r\nthe matter left as it had been under the Territorial government, viz.:\r\nin the hands of the Legislature. To this end, H. F. Miller introduced\r\nthe following clause:\r\n\r\n     The Legislature shall be empowered to make further extensions of\r\n     suffrage hereafter at its discretion to all citizens of mature\r\n     age and sound mind, not convicted of crime, without regard to\r\n     sex, but it shall not restrict suffrage without a vote of the\r\n     people.\r\n\r\nToward the adoption of this all efforts were directed. Two public\r\nmeetings were addressed by Mr. Blackwell, and on July 8 the\r\nConstitutional Convention itself invited him to speak to its members.\r\n\r\nAfter remaining in Bismarck two weeks he went to Helena to attend the\r\nMontana convention, but before leaving he succeeded in obtaining the\r\npromise of 30 votes out of the 38 necessary for the adoption of the\r\nclause. During his absence Dr. Cora Smith (Eaton), secretary of the\r\nGrand Forks Suffrage Club, was called to Bismarck to carry on the\r\nwork. The secretary of the Territory, L. B. Richardson, placed at her\r\nservice a room on the same floor as Convention Hall, and to this the\r\nfriends of woman suffrage brought members who had not yet declared\r\nthemselves in favor. Some ladies were always there to receive them and\r\npresent the arguments in the case, among these Mrs. Mary Wilson, Mrs.\r\nGeorge Watson, Dr. Kate Perkins and Mrs. Benjamin of Bismarck.\r\nEverything was managed with scrupulous formality and courtesy.\r\n\r\nMr. Miller's proposition was championed by R. M. Pollock and Judge\r\nJohn E. Carland in Committee of the Whole, and after a second reading\r\nwas referred to the Committee on Elective Franchise, but on July 25 it\r\nreported the substitute of S. H. Moer, confining the suffrage to\r\nmales. A minority report was offered, directing the Legislature at its\r\nfirst session to submit an amendment to the voters to enfranchise\r\nwomen. After a heated discussion the minority report was defeated, and\r\nthe constitution provided as follows:\r\n\r\n     No law extending or restricting the right of suffrage shall be\r\n     enforced until adopted by _a majority of the electors of the\r\n     State voting at a general election_.\r\n\r\nBy requiring not merely a majority of those voting on the question but\r\nof the largest number voting at the election, no amendment for any\r\npurpose ever has been carried.\r\n\r\nOn the question of School Suffrage women received greater\r\nconsideration, the constitution providing that all women properly\r\nqualified should vote for all school officers, including State\r\nSuperintendent, also upon any question pertaining solely to school\r\nmatters, and should be eligible to any school office.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION: The suffragists were widely scattered over this immense\r\nTerritory and there had been little opportunity for organized work. In\r\nthe spring of 1888 a call had been issued in Grand Forks, signed by\r\nseventy-five representative men and women, for a meeting to form an\r\nassociation, and on April 12 this was held in the court-house, which\r\nwas crowded to the doors. The extension of the franchise to women was\r\nstrongly advocated by Judge J. M. Cochrane, Prof. H. B. Wentworth,\r\nMrs. Sara E. B. Smith, Mrs. Sue R. Caswell and others; and encouraging\r\nletters were read from the Hon. William Dudley Foulke, Lucy Stone and\r\nJulia Ward Howe of the American Suffrage Association. A public meeting\r\non July 25 at the same place was addressed by Mrs. Ella M. S. Marble\r\nof Minnesota. On September 9 Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake of New York\r\ngave a strong lecture.\r\n\r\nOther local clubs were formed during the following years, and the\r\nfirst State convention was held in Grand Forks, Nov. 14, 15, 1895. It\r\nwas called to order by Dr. Cora Smith Eaton, president of the local\r\nsociety. Mrs. Laura M. Johns of Kansas, a national organizer who had\r\njust made a successful lecturing tour of the State, was elected\r\nchairman and Mrs. Edwinna Sturman was made secretary. Cordial letters\r\nof greeting were read from Miss Susan B. Anthony, president of the\r\nNational Suffrage Association, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of\r\nthe national organization committee, U. S. Senator Henry C.\r\nHansbrough,[202] Miss Elizabeth Preston, president of the State W. C.\r\nT. U., and others. In Miss Anthony's letter was outlined the plan of\r\nwork that she never failed to recommend to State organizations, which\r\nsaid in part:\r\n\r\n     First, your local clubs should cover the respective _townships_,\r\n     and the officers should not only hold meetings of their own to\r\n     discuss questions pertaining to their work, but should have the\r\n     men, when they go into their _town meetings_ for any and every\r\n     purpose pertaining to local affairs--especially into the meetings\r\n     which nominate delegates to county conventions--pledged to\r\n     present a resolution in favor of the enfranchisement of women. By\r\n     this means you will secure the discussion of the question by the\r\n     men who compose the different political parties in each\r\n     township--an educational work that can not be done through any\r\n     distinctively woman suffrage meeting, because so few of the rank\r\n     and file of voters ever attend these.\r\n\r\n     Then, when the time comes for the county convention to elect\r\n     delegates to the State nominating convention, let every town\r\n     meeting see to it that they are instructed to vote for a\r\n     resolution favoring the submission and indorsement of a\r\n     proposition to strike the word \"male\" from your constitution. If\r\n     the State conventions of the several parties are to put\r\n     indorsement planks in their platforms, the demand for these must\r\n     come from the townships composing the counties sending delegates\r\n     thereto. Women going before a committee and asking a resolution\r\n     indorsing equal suffrage, are sure to be met with the statement\r\n     that _they have heard nothing of any such demand among their\r\n     constituents_. This has been the response on the many different\r\n     occasions when this request has been made of State conventions.\r\n     From this repeated and sad experience we have learned that _we\r\n     must begin with the constituents_ in each township and have the\r\n     demand start there.\r\n\r\nDr. Eaton was elected president of the association.\r\n\r\nThe second convention took place at Fargo, Nov. 30, 1897. An extra\r\nmeeting was held this year at the Devil's Lake Chautauqua Assembly on\r\nWoman's Day, with Mrs. Julia B. Nelson, president of the Minnesota,\r\nand Mrs. Ella Knowles Haskell, of the Montana W. S. A., among the\r\nspeakers. Dr. Eaton having removed from the State, Miss Mary Allen\r\nWhedon was made president.\r\n\r\nThe third convention met in Larimore, Sept. 27, 28, 1898, with\r\ndelegates from eleven counties. Mrs. Chapman Catt was present and\r\ncontributed much to the success of the meetings. These were held in\r\nthe M. E. Church with the active co-operation of the pastor, the Rev.\r\nH. C. Cooper. Mrs. Flora Blackman Naylor was chosen president.\r\n\r\nThe fourth convention was held in Hillsboro, Sept. 26, 27, 1899, at\r\nwhich Mrs. Susan S. Fessenden of Massachusetts gave valuable\r\nassistance. A page to be devoted to suffrage matter was secured in the\r\n_White Ribbon Bulletin_, a paper published monthly under the auspices\r\nof the State W. C. T. U.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1900 convened in Lakota, September 25, 26, in\r\nthe M. E. Church, its pastor, the Rev. Stephen Whitford, making the\r\naddress of welcome. A Matron's Silver Medal Oratorical Contest was\r\ngiven under the direction of Mrs. Cora Ross Clark.[203]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In the Legislature of 1893 a bill was\r\nintroduced granting women taxpayers the right of suffrage. This was\r\nvoted down by the House: 18 ayes; 22 noes. A motion was offered that\r\nall woman suffrage bills hereafter presented at this session should be\r\nrejected, but it was tabled.\r\n\r\nA bill to submit to the voters an amendment conferring Full Suffrage\r\non women in the manner provided by the constitution was introduced in\r\nthe Senate by J. W. Stevens and passed by 16 ayes, 15 noes. It was\r\ncalled up in the House on the last day of the session. Miss Elizabeth\r\nPreston was invited to address that body, and the Senate took a recess\r\nand came in. The bill received 33 ayes, a constitutional majority, and\r\nwas returned to the Senate. The House then took a recess, and during\r\nthis brief time the enemies of the measure secured enough votes to\r\nrecall it from the Senate. This body by vote refused to send it back,\r\nthus endorsing it a second time. The Speaker of the House, George H.\r\nWalsh, refused to sign it. Then began a long fight between the House\r\nand the Senate. A motion was made by Judson La Moure instructing the\r\nPresident of the Senate to sign no more House bills until the Speaker\r\nsigned the Woman Suffrage Bill. This armed neutrality lasted until 10\r\no'clock that night when some of the senators, who had important\r\nmeasures yet to pass, weakened and voted to send the bill back to the\r\nHouse. When it reached there a motion prevailed to expunge all the\r\nrecords relating to it.\r\n\r\nIn the Legislature of 1895 a bill for a suffrage amendment was\r\nintroduced in the House by A. W. Edwards, editor of the Fargo _Forum_.\r\nMrs. Emma Smith DeVoe was sent by the National Association to assist\r\nin the work for the passage of this and other bills of interest to\r\nwomen. The courtesy of the floor was extended to her in the House and\r\nshe was invited to address the members, the Senate again taking a\r\nrecess and coming in to listen. Col. W. C. Plummer spoke against the\r\nbill, which received 28 ayes but not a constitutional majority. No\r\nsuffrage bill has been introduced since.[204]\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy have been abolished. If either husband or wife die\r\nwithout a will, leaving only one child or the lawful issue of one\r\nchild, the survivor is entitled to one-half of the real and personal\r\nestate. If there is more than one child living, or one child and the\r\nlawful issue of one or more children, the widow or widower receives\r\none-third of the estate. If there is no issue living, he or she\r\nreceives one-half of the estate; and if there is neither father,\r\nmother, brother nor sister, the whole of it. The survivor may retain a\r\nhomestead to the value of $5,000, which on his or her death the minor\r\nchildren are entitled to occupy.\r\n\r\nA married woman may contract, sue and be sued and proceed in all\r\nactions as if unmarried. She may dispose of all her separate property\r\nby deed or will, without the consent of her husband. He can not do\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the persons, estates and earnings\r\nof the minor children. If he abandon them the mother is entitled\r\nthereto. At his death she is the guardian, if suitable. Should she\r\nmarry again she loses the guardianship but, by agreement, the court\r\nmay re-appoint her.\r\n\r\nIf the husband is not able to support the family the wife must\r\nmaintain him and the children to the best of her ability, and her\r\nseparate estate may be held liable. If he wilfully neglect to provide\r\nfor them his separate property shall be held liable, and he may be\r\nimprisoned in the county jail not less than sixty days nor more than\r\nsix months.\r\n\r\nIn case either husband or wife abandons the family and leaves the\r\nState for a year or more, or is sent to prison for a year or more, the\r\ncourt may authorize the one remaining to sell or encumber the property\r\nof the other for the maintenance of the family or the debts which were\r\nleft unpaid after due notice has been given to the absent one.\r\n\r\nThe causes for divorce do not differ from those in a number of other\r\nStates, but by requiring a residence of only six months a great\r\ninducement is offered to persons from outside to come here for the\r\nexpress purpose of securing a divorce.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 14 years in\r\n1887. The women attempted in 1895 to have it raised to 18 but\r\nsucceeded only in getting 16 years. The reduction of the penalty,\r\nhowever, made this of small avail. For the first degree it is\r\nimprisonment in the penitentiary not less than ten years; second\r\ndegree, imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than five years.\r\n\"But no conviction can be had in case the female is over the age of 10\r\nyears and the man under the age of 20 years, and it appears to the\r\nsatisfaction of the jury that the female was sufficiently matured and\r\ninformed to understand the nature of the act and consent thereto.\"\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: The Territorial Legislature of 1879 gave women a vote on\r\nquestions pertaining to the schools, which were then decided at school\r\nmeetings. This was partially repealed by a law of 1883 which required\r\nregular polls and a private ballot, but this Act did not include\r\nfifteen counties which had school districts fully established, and\r\nwomen still continued to vote at these district school meetings. In\r\n1887 a law was enacted giving all women the right to vote at all\r\nschool elections for all officers, and making them eligible for all\r\nschool offices. By the State constitution adopted in 1889 all women\r\nproperly qualified may vote for all public school officers, including\r\nState Superintendent, and on all questions pertaining solely to school\r\nmatters.\r\n\r\nAt the special school election held in Grand Forks, Aug. 4, 1890, Mrs.\r\nSara E. B. Smith and Dr. Cora Smith (Eaton) voted. Objections were\r\nraised, but with the law and the constitution back of them they\r\ncarried the day. On September 5, in response to a request from the\r\nGrand Forks W. S. A., Attorney-General J. M. Cochrane gave a written\r\nopinion that the provision of the constitution relating to woman\r\nsuffrage was not self-executing, and that until supplementary\r\nlegislation was enacted providing the requisite machinery for\r\nrecording school ballots cast by women, they could not vote. As the\r\nauthorities in a number of places refused to provide separate boxes,\r\nthe Legislature of 1893 passed an act requiring them.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women are eligible for all school offices, but for no\r\nother elective office.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 Mrs. Laura J. Eisenhuth was elected State Superintendent of\r\nPublic Instruction on the Democratic ticket. In 1894 she was again\r\nnominated but was defeated by Miss Emma Bates on the Republican\r\nticket.\r\n\r\nEleven women are now serving as county superintendents, and many on\r\nlocal school boards. They do not sit on any State boards. All of the\r\ndirectors of the Woman's Reformatory, under control of the W. C. T.\r\nU., are women.\r\n\r\nIn the Legislature they serve as librarians, journal, enrolling and\r\nengrossing clerks and stenographers. They act also as deputies in\r\nState, county and city offices. By special statute of 1893 they may be\r\nnotaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All of the educational institutions are open to both sexes\r\nalike and women are on the faculties. Dr. Janette Hill Knox was\r\nvice-president of Red River Valley University (Meth. Epis.) for five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThere are in the public schools 1,115 men and 2,522 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $39.92; of the women,\r\n$35.57.\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Christian Temperance Union was the first and still\r\ncontinues to be the largest of the organizations. It works for the\r\nfranchise through public lectures, petitions, legislative bills and\r\nvarious educational measures. The Woman's Relief Corps and a large\r\nnumber of church, lodge and literary societies enlist women's\r\nactivities in a marked degree. They sit on the official boards of many\r\nchurches and some of these are composed entirely of women.\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH DAKOTA.[205]\r\n\r\nIn June, 1883, a convention was held at Huron to discuss the question\r\nof dividing the Territory and forming two States, and a convention was\r\ncalled to meet at Sioux Falls, September 4, and prepare a constitution\r\nfor those in the southern portion. The suffrage leaders in the East\r\nwere anxious that this should include the franchise for women. Mrs.\r\nMatilda Joslyn Gage of New York, vice-president-at-large of the\r\nNational Suffrage Association, lectured at various points in the\r\nTerritory during the summer to awaken public sentiment on this\r\nquestion. On September 6 a petition signed by 1,000 Dakota men and\r\nwomen, praying that the word \"male\" should not be incorporated in the\r\nconstitution, was presented to the convention, accompanied by personal\r\nappeals. There was some disposition to grant this request but the\r\nopponents prevailed and only the school ballot was given to women,\r\nwhich they already possessed by Act of the Legislature of 1879.\r\nHowever, this constitution never was acted upon.\r\n\r\nThe desire for division and Statehood became very urgent throughout\r\nthe great Territory, and this, with the growing sentiment in Congress\r\nin favor of the same, induced the Legislature of 1885 to provide for a\r\nconvention at Sioux Falls, composed of members elected by the voters\r\nof the Territory, to form a constitution for the proposed new State of\r\nSouth Dakota and submit the same to the electors for adoption, which\r\nwas done in November, 1885. Many of the women had become landholders\r\nand were interested in the location of schoolhouses, county seats,\r\nState capital and matters of taxation. As their only organization was\r\nthe Woman's Christian Temperance Union, a committee was appointed\r\nfrom that body, consisting of Alice M. A. Pickler, Superintendent of\r\nthe Franchise Department, Helen M. Barker and Julia Welch, to appear\r\nbefore the Committee on Suffrage and ask that the word \"male\" be left\r\nout of the qualifications of electors. They were helped by letters to\r\nmembers of the convention from Lucy Stone, Henry B. Blackwell, Susan\r\nB. Anthony, Lillie Devereux Blake and others of national reputation.\r\n\r\nSeven of the eleven members of the committee were willing to grant\r\nthis request but there was so much opposition from the convention,\r\nlest the chances for Statehood might be imperiled, that they compelled\r\na compromise and it was directed that the first Legislature should\r\nsubmit the question to the voters. They did incorporate a clause,\r\nhowever, that women properly qualified should be eligible to any\r\nschool office and should vote at any election held solely for school\r\npurposes. This applied merely to school trustees, as State and county\r\nsuperintendents are elected at general and not special elections.\r\n\r\nThe constitution was ratified by the voters in 1885, with a provision\r\nthat \"the Legislature should at its first session after the admission\r\nof the State into the Union, submit to a vote of the electors at the\r\nnext general election, the question whether the word 'male' should be\r\nstricken from the article of the constitution relating to elections\r\nand the right of suffrage.\"\r\n\r\nCongress at that time refused to divide the Territory and thus the\r\nquestion remained in abeyance awaiting Statehood.\r\n\r\nIn 1889, an enabling act having been passed by Congress, delegates\r\nwere elected from the different counties to meet in convention at\r\nSioux Falls to prepare for the entrance of South Dakota into\r\nStatehood. This convention reaffirmed the constitution adopted in\r\n1885, and again submitted it to the voters who again passed upon it\r\nfavorably, and the Territory became a State, Nov. 2, 1889.\r\n\r\nThe first Legislature met at once in Pierre, and although they were\r\nrequired by the constitution to submit an amendment for woman suffrage\r\na vote was taken as to whether this should be done. It stood in the\r\nSenate 40 yeas, one nay; absent or not voting, 4; in the House 84\r\nyeas, 9 nays; 21 absent.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 11, 1889, Miss Anthony, in response to urgent requests from\r\nthe State, made a lecture tour of twelve cities and towns and\r\naddressed the Farmers' Alliance at their convention in Aberdeen, when\r\nthey officially indorsed the suffrage amendment. On her return home\r\nshe sent 50,000 copies of Senator T. W. Palmer's great woman suffrage\r\nspeech to individual voters in Dakota under his frank.\r\n\r\nA State Suffrage Association had been formed with S. A. Ramsey,\r\npresident, Alonzo Wardall, vice-president, the Rev. M. Barker,\r\nsecretary, and Mrs. Helen M. Barker, treasurer and State organizer;\r\nbut the beginning of this campaign found the women with no funds and\r\nvery little local organization. Mr. Wardall, who was also secretary of\r\nthe Farmers' Alliance, went to Washington and, with Representative and\r\nMrs. J. A. Pickler, presented a strong appeal for assistance to the\r\nnational suffrage convention in February, 1890. It was heartily\r\nresponded to and a South Dakota campaign committee was formed with\r\nMiss Anthony chairman. The officers and friends made vigorous efforts\r\nto raise a fund and eventually $5,500 were secured. Of this amount\r\nCalifornia sent $1,000; Senator Stanford personally gave $300; Rachel\r\nFoster Avery of Philadelphia, the same amount; Mrs. Clara L. McAdow of\r\nMontana, $250; a number gave $100, among them U. S. Senator R. F.\r\nPettigrew of South Dakota, and different States sent various\r\nsums.[206]\r\n\r\nThe first of May Miss Anthony returned to South Dakota and established\r\ncampaign headquarters in Huron. A mass convention of men and women was\r\nheld and an active State organization formed with Mrs. Philena Everett\r\nJohnson, president, Mr. Wardall, vice-president, which co-operated\r\nwith the national committee and inaugurated an active campaign. The\r\nnew State had adopted as its motto, \"Under God the People Rule,\" and\r\nthe suffragists wrote upon their banners, \"Under God the People Rule.\r\nWomen Are People.\" A large number of national speakers came in the\r\nsummer. Local workers would organize suffrage clubs in the\r\nschoolhouses and these efforts would culminate in large rallies at the\r\ncounty seats where some noted speakers would make addresses and\r\nperfect the organization.\r\n\r\nThose from the outside who canvassed the State were Henry B.\r\nBlackwell, editor _Woman's Journal_, Boston, the Rev. Anna Howard\r\nShaw, national lecturer, Mary Seymour Howell (N. Y.), the Rev. Olympia\r\nBrown (Wis.), Matilda Hindman (Penn.), Carrie Chapman Catt (Wash.),\r\nLaura M. Johns (Kan.), Clara Bewick Colby (Neb.), the Rev. Helen G.\r\nPutnam (N. D.), Julia B. Nelson (Minn.) Miss Anthony was always and\r\neverywhere the moving spirit and contributed her services the entire\r\nsix months without pay. When $300 were lacking to settle the final\r\nexpenses she paid them out of her own pocket. Mr. Blackwell also\r\ndonated his services. Most effective State work was done by Mrs. Emma\r\nSmith De Voe, and the home of Mr. and Mrs. De Voe was a haven of rest\r\nfor the toilers during the campaign. Among the other valuable State\r\nworkers were Dr. Nettie C. Hall, Mrs. Helen M. Barker, and Mrs.\r\nElizabeth M. Wardall, superintendent of press. A large number of\r\nministers indorsed the amendment. Two grand rallies of all the\r\nspeakers were held, one in Mitchell, August 26, 27, during which time\r\nMiss Anthony, Mr. Blackwell, Miss Shaw and Mrs. Pickler addressed the\r\nRepublican State Convention; the other during the State Fair in\r\nSeptember. The 17th was \"Woman's Day\" and the Fair Association invited\r\nthe ladies to speak. Miss Anthony, Miss Shaw and Mrs. De Voe complied.\r\nThe summing up of the superintendent of press was as follows: Total\r\nnumber of addresses by national speakers, 789; State speakers, 707;\r\nunder the auspices of the W. C. T. U., 104; total, 1,600; local clubs\r\nof women organized, 400; literature sent to every voter.\r\n\r\nIt would be difficult to put into words the hardships of this campaign\r\nof 1890 in a new State through the hottest and dryest summer on\r\nrecord. Frequently the speakers had to drive twenty miles between the\r\nafternoon and evening meetings and the audiences would come thirty\r\nmiles. All of the political State conventions declined to indorse the\r\namendment. The Republicans refused seats to the ladies on the floor of\r\ntheir convention although Indians in blankets were welcomed. The\r\nDemocrats invited the ladies to seats where they listened to a speech\r\nagainst woman suffrage by E. W. Miller, land receiver of the Huron\r\ndistrict, too indecent to print, which was received with cheers and\r\napplause by the convention. The minority committee report asking for\r\nan indorsement, presented by Judge Bangs of Rapid City, was\r\noverwhelmingly voted down. A big delegation of Russians came to this\r\nconvention wearing huge yellow badges lettered, Against Woman Suffrage\r\nand Susan B. Anthony.\r\n\r\nThe greatest disappointment of the campaign was the forming of an\r\nIndependent party by the Farmers' Alliance and the Knights of Labor.\r\nThe Alliance at its convention the previous year, 478 delegates\r\npresent, at the close of Miss Anthony's address, had declared that\r\nthey would do all in their power to carry the suffrage amendment, and\r\nit was principally on account of their assurances of support and on\r\nthe invitation of their leaders, that she undertook the work in South\r\nDakota. The Knights of Labor at their convention in January of the\r\npresent year had adopted a resolution which said: \"We will support\r\nwith all our strength the amendment to be voted on at the next general\r\nelection giving women the ballot ... believing this to be the first\r\nstep toward securing those reforms for which all true Knights of Labor\r\nare striving.\"\r\n\r\nBut the following June these two organizations formed a new party and\r\nabsolutely refused to put a woman suffrage plank in their platform,\r\nalthough Miss Anthony addressed their convention and implored them to\r\nkeep their promise, assuring them that their failure to support the\r\namendment would be its death blow. The previous summer H. L. Loucks,\r\npresident of the Farmers' Alliance, had made a special journey to the\r\nState suffrage convention at Minneapolis to invite her to come to\r\nSouth Dakota to conduct this canvass. He was a candidate for Governor\r\non this new party ticket and in his speech of acceptance did not\r\nmention the pending amendment. Before adjourning the convention\r\nadopted a long resolution containing seven or eight declarations,\r\namong them one that \"no citizen should be disfranchised on account of\r\nsex,\" but so far as any party advocacy was concerned the question was\r\na dead issue.\r\n\r\nA bitter contest was being made between Huron and Pierre for the\r\nlocation of the State capital, and the woman suffrage amendment was\r\nfreely used as an article of barter. There were 30,000 Russians,\r\nPoles, Scandinavians and other foreigners in the State, most of whom\r\nopposed woman suffrage. The liquor dealers and gamblers worked\r\nvigorously against it, and they were reinforced by the women\r\n\"remonstrants\" of Massachusetts, who sent their literature into every\r\ncorner of the State.\r\n\r\nAt the election, Nov. 4, 1890, the amendment received 22,072 ayes,\r\n45,862 noes, majority opposed 23,790. The Republicans carried the\r\nState by 16,000 majority.\r\n\r\nAt this same election an amendment was submitted as to whether male\r\nIndians should be enfranchised. It received an affirmative vote of 45\r\nper cent.; that for woman suffrage received 35 per cent. Of the two\r\nclasses of voters it seemed the men preferred the Indians. It was\r\nclaimed by many, however, that they did not understand the wording of\r\nthe Indian amendment and thought they were voting against it.[207]\r\n\r\nAs the School Suffrage possessed by women applied only to trustees and\r\ndid not include the important offices of State and county\r\nsuperintendents, and as it was held that the franchise for this\r\npurpose could be secured only by a constitutional amendment, it was\r\ndecided to ask for this. Through the efforts of Mrs. Anna R. Simmons\r\nand Mrs. Emma A. Cranmer, officers of the State Association, a bill\r\nfor this purpose was secured from the Legislature of 1893. As there\r\nseemed to be no objection to women's voting for school trustees it was\r\nnot supposed that there would be any to extending the privilege for\r\nthe other school officers. It was submitted at the regular election in\r\nNovember, 1894, and defeated by 17,010 ayes, 22,682 noes, an opposing\r\nmajority of 5,672.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the above ladies made one more effort and secured from the\r\nLegislature the submission again of an amendment conferring the Full\r\nSuffrage on women. The campaign was managed almost entirely by Mrs.\r\nSimmons and Mrs. Cranmer. The National Association assisted to the\r\nextent of sending a lecturer, Miss Laura A. Gregg of Kansas, who\r\nremained for two months preceding the election; and $100 worth of\r\nliterature also was furnished for distribution. The Dakota women\r\nraised about $1,500, and every possible influence was exerted upon the\r\nvoters. The returns of the election in November, 1898, gave for the\r\namendment 19,698; against, 22,983; adverse majority, 3,285.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the amendment had received 35 per cent. of the whole vote cast\r\nupon it; in 1898 it received 77 per cent. The figures show\r\nunmistakably that the falling off in the size of the vote was almost\r\nwholly among the opponents.[208]\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION: After the defeat of the suffrage amendment in 1890 a\r\nmore thorough State organization was effected and a convention has\r\nbeen held every year since. That of 1891 met in Huron and Mrs. Irene\r\nG. Adams was elected president. Soon afterwards she compiled a leaflet\r\nshowing the unjust laws for women which disgraced the statute books.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a successful annual meeting took place at Hastings and Mrs.\r\nMary A. Groesbeck was made president. In September, 1893, the\r\nconvention was held in Aberdeen during the Grain Palace Exposition.\r\nThe State president and the president elect, Mrs. Emma A. Cranmer, had\r\ncharge of the program for Woman's Day, and Mrs. Clara Hoffman (Mo.)\r\ngave addresses in the afternoon and evening.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Mrs. Anna R. Simmons was elected president and continued in\r\noffice for six years. This year $100 was sent to aid the Kansas\r\ncampaign. During 1894 and '95 she made twenty public addresses and\r\nheld ten parlor meetings. At the convention in Pierre in September,\r\n1895, she was able to report fifty clubs organized with 700 members.\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the national organization\r\ncommittee, was present at this convention.\r\n\r\nActive work was continued throughout 1896 and 1897, when the\r\nsubmission of a suffrage amendment was secured. The year of 1898 was\r\ngiven up to efforts for its success. Mrs. C. C. King established and\r\ncarried on almost entirely at her own expense the _South Dakota\r\nMessenger_, a campaign paper which was of the greatest service. The\r\nState convention met in Mitchell September 28-30. Miss Elizabeth Upham\r\nYates (Me.) came as representative of the National Association and\r\ngave two addresses to large audiences. The following October a\r\nconference of National and State workers was held at Sioux Falls, the\r\nformer represented by Mrs. Chapman Catt, the Rev. Henrietta G. Moore\r\n(O.) and Miss Mary G. Hay, national organizers. Several public\r\nsessions were held.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1899 took place in Madison, September 5, 6. The\r\ntenth convention met in Brookings, Sept. 5, 1900. Mrs. Simmons having\r\nremoved from the State, Mrs. Alice M. A. Pickler was elected\r\npresident. Mrs. Philena Everett Johnson was made vice-president.[209]\r\n\r\nAmong the prominent friends of woman suffrage may be mentioned the\r\nHon. Arthur C. Mellette, first State Governor; U. S. Senators Richard\r\nF. Pettigrew, James H. Kyle and Robert J. Gamble; Lieutenant-Governor\r\nD. T. Hindman; members of Congress J. A. Pickler, W. B. Lucas and\r\nE. W. Martin; the Hons. S. A. Ramsey and Coe I. Crawford;\r\nAttorney-General John L. Pyle, Judge D. C. Thomas, General W. H.\r\nBeadle, Professor McClennen, of the Madison Normal School, and\r\nministers of many churches. The Hon. J. H. Patton and the Hon. W. C.\r\nBowers paid the expenses of the legislative committee of the suffrage\r\nassociation while they were in Pierre during the winter of 1897 to\r\nsecure the submission of an amendment. Chief Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt A. J. Edgerton, was a pronounced advocate of woman suffrage and\r\nappointed a woman official stenographer of his judicial district, the\r\nbest salaried office within his gift. Associate Justice Seward Smith\r\nappointed a woman clerk of the Faulk County district court.[210]\r\n\r\nLAWS: Neither dower nor curtesy obtains. If either husband or wife die\r\nwithout a will, leaving only one child or the lawful issue of one, the\r\nsurvivor is entitled to one-half of the separate estate of the other;\r\nor one-third if there are more than one child or the issue of more\r\nthan one. If there are no children nor the issue of any, the survivor\r\nis entitled to one-half of the estate and the other half goes to the\r\nkindred of the deceased. If there are none the survivor takes all. A\r\nhomestead of 160 acres, or one-quarter of an acre in town, may be\r\nreserved for the widow or widower.\r\n\r\nEither husband or wife may dispose of separate property, real or\r\npersonal, by deed or will, without the consent of the other. Joint\r\nreal estate, including the homestead, can be conveyed only by\r\nsignature of both, but the husband may dispose of joint personal\r\nproperty without the consent of the wife.\r\n\r\nIn order to control her separate property the wife must keep it\r\nrecorded in the office of the county register.\r\n\r\nOn the death of an unmarried child the father inherits all of its\r\nproperty. If he is dead and there are no other children, the mother\r\ninherits it. If there are brothers and sisters she inherits a child's\r\nshare.\r\n\r\nA married woman can not act as administrator. Of several persons\r\nclaiming and equally entitled to act as executors, males must be\r\npreferred to females.\r\n\r\nA married woman can control her earnings outside the home only when\r\nliving separate from her husband.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian and has custody of the persons and\r\nservices of minor children. If he refuse to take the custody or has\r\nabandoned his family or has been legally declared a drunkard, the\r\nmother is entitled to the custody.\r\n\r\nThe law declares the husband the head of the family and he must\r\nsupport the wife by his separate property or labor, but if he has not\r\ndeserted her, and has no separate property, and is too infirm to\r\nsupport her by his labor, the wife must support him and their children\r\nout of her separate property or in other ways to the extent of her\r\nability. An act of Feb. 21, 1896, makes the wife liable for\r\nnecessaries for the family purchased on her own account to the same\r\nextent that her husband would be liable under a similar purchase, but\r\nwith no control over the joint earnings.\r\n\r\nThe causes for divorce are the same as in most States but only six\r\nmonths' residence is required. The disposition of the children is left\r\nentirely with the court.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, through the efforts of the W.C.T.U., the \"age of protection\"\r\nfor girls was raised from 10 to 14 years. In 1893 they tried to have\r\nit made 18 but the Legislature compromised on 16 years. Rape in the\r\nfirst degree _is punishable_ by imprisonment in the penitentiary not\r\nless than ten years; in the second degree, not less than five years.\r\n\r\nThe penalty for seduction and for enticing away for purposes of\r\nprostitution is prescribed by the same words \"is punishable,\" which in\r\nreality leaves it to the judgment of the court, but the statutes fix\r\nthe penalty for all other crimes by the words \"shall be punished.\" In\r\naddition to this latitude the penalty for seduction or enticing for\r\npurposes of prostitution is, if the girl is under 15, imprisonment in\r\nthe penitentiary not more than five years, or in the county jail not\r\nmore than one year, or by fine not exceeding $1,000, or both; with no\r\nminimum penalty.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: The Territorial Legislature of 1879 gave women a vote on\r\nquestions pertaining to the schools, which were then decided at school\r\nmeetings. This was partially repealed by a law of 1883 which required\r\nregular polls and a private ballot, but this act did not include\r\nfifteen counties which had school districts fully established, and\r\nwomen still continued to vote at these district school meetings. In\r\n1887 a law was enacted giving all women the right to vote at all\r\nschool elections for all officers, and making them eligible for all\r\nschool offices. The constitution which was adopted when South Dakota\r\nentered the Union (1889) provided that \"any woman having the required\r\nqualifications as to age, residence and citizenship may vote at any\r\nelection held solely for school purposes.\" As State and county\r\nsuperintendents are elected at general and not special elections,\r\nwomen can vote only for school trustees. They have no vote on bonds or\r\nappropriations.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: The State constitution provides that all persons,\r\neither male or female, being twenty-one years of age and having the\r\nnecessary qualifications, shall be eligible to the office of school\r\ndirector, treasurer, judge or clerk of school elections, county\r\nsuperintendent of public schools and State Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction. All other civil offices must be filled by male electors.\r\n\r\nThere are at present eleven women serving as county superintendents.\r\nThey sit on the school boards in many places and have been treasurers.\r\nA woman was nominated for State Superintendent of Public Instruction\r\nby the Independent party.\r\n\r\nEfforts to secure a law requiring women on the boards of State\r\ninstitutions have failed. The Governor is required to appoint three\r\nwomen inspectors of penal and charitable institutions, who are paid by\r\nthe State and make their report directly to him. They inspect the\r\npenitentiary, reform school, insane hospitals, deaf and dumb institute\r\nand school for the blind. There is one assistant woman physician in\r\nthe State Hospital for the Insane. Women in subordinate official\r\npositions are found in all State institutions.\r\n\r\nThey act as clerks in all city, county and State offices and in the\r\nLegislature, and have served as court stenographers and clerk of the\r\nCircuit Court.\r\n\r\nThere are eight women notaries public at the present time.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen. Ten hours is made a legal working day for them. Four women are\r\nediting county papers.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All institutions of learning are open alike to both sexes\r\nand there are women on the faculties. In the public schools there are\r\n1,225 men and 3,581 women teachers. The average monthly salary of the\r\nmen is $36.45; of the women $30.82.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe W.C.T.U. was the first organization of women in the State and\r\nthrough its franchise department has worked earnestly and collected\r\nnumerous petitions for suffrage. The Woman's Relief Corps is the\r\nlargest body, having 1,800 members. The Eastern Star, Daughters of\r\nRebekah, Ladies of the Maccabees, and other lodge societies are well\r\norganized. The Federation of Clubs, the youngest association,\r\nrepresents 200 members. A number of churches have women on their\r\nofficial boards.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[200] At the New Orleans Exposition in 1885 the displays of Kansas,\r\nDakota and Nebraska taught the world the artistic value of grains and\r\ngrasses for decoration, but it was exemplified most strikingly in the\r\nDakota's Woman's Department, arranged by Mrs. J. M. Melton of Fargo.\r\nAmong the industrial exhibits was a carriage robe sent from a leading\r\nfurrier to represent the skilled work of women in his employ. There\r\nwere also bird fans, a curtain of duck skins and cases of taxidermy,\r\nall prepared and cured by women, and a case of work from women\r\nemployed in the printing office of the Fargo Argus. Four thousand\r\nbouquets of grasses were distributed on Dakota Day and carried away as\r\ncurious and beautiful memorials. All were made by women in the\r\nTerritory.\r\n\r\n[201] The History is indebted for this part of the chapter to Dr.\r\nJanette Hill Knox, of Wahpeton, corresponding secretary of the State\r\nWoman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[202] U. S. Senator W. N. Roach also wrote and voted in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage. Martin N. Johnson, M. C., was a strong advocate.\r\n\r\n[203] Officers elected: Honorary presidents, Dr. Cora Smith Eaton and\r\nMiss Mary Allen Whedon; president, Mrs. Flora Blackman Naylor;\r\nvice-president, Mrs. G. S. Roberts; corresponding secretary, Dr.\r\nJanette Hill Knox; recording secretary, Mrs. Henrietta Paulson\r\nHaagenson; treasurer, Mrs. Anna Carmody; auditors, Mrs. J. S. Kemp,\r\nMrs. Addie L. Carr; member national executive committee, Mrs. Lois L.\r\nMuir; organizer and lecturer, Mrs. Mary E. Slater; press\r\nsuperintendent, Mrs. Flora P. Gates.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these, the following have served as State officers:\r\nVice-presidents, Mesdames Mary Wilson, Florence Dixon and G. S.\r\nRoberts; corresponding secretaries, Mrs. Sara E. B. Smith, Mrs. Delia\r\nLee Hyde; recording secretary, Mrs. Helen de Lendrecie; treasurer,\r\nMrs. Katherine V. King; auditors, Dr. Helena G. Wink and Mesdames M.\r\nB. Goodrich, L. C. McKinney and L. C. Campbell.\r\n\r\nAmong other efficient workers may be mentioned Gov. Eli Shortridge,\r\nGov. Roger Allen, Dr. M. V. B. Knox, Miss Bena Halerow, and Mesdames\r\nIda S. Clark, Mazie Stevens, Nellie Mott, Frances M. Dixon, R. C.\r\nCooper and S. M. Woodhull.\r\n\r\n[204] In the Legislature of 1901 a bill was introduced in the House by\r\nH. E. Lavayea of Grand Forks County, to take away School Suffrage from\r\nwomen. The bill was unconstitutional and was never reported from the\r\ncommittee, but its introduction stirred up indignant protests from all\r\nparts of the State.\r\n\r\n[205] The History is indebted to Mrs. Alice M. A. Pickler of Faulkton,\r\npresident of the State Woman Suffrage Association, for the material\r\ncontained in this part of the chapter.\r\n\r\n[206] The speakers raised about $1,400 which went toward paying their\r\nexpenses. Over $1,000 were secured by other means. Most of the State\r\nworkers donated their expenses.\r\n\r\n[207] A graphic account of this campaign, with many anecdotes and\r\npersonal reminiscences, will be found in the Life and Work of Susan B.\r\nAnthony, Chap. XXXVIII.\r\n\r\n[208] Petitions have been presented to several Legislatures to grant\r\nMunicipal Suffrage by statute but a bill for this purpose has been\r\nbrought to a vote only once, in 1893, when it was passed by the\r\nSenate, 27 ayes, 11 noes; and defeated in the House by only one vote.\r\n\r\n[209] Others who have served in official position are vice-president,\r\nMrs. Emma A. Cranmer; corresponding secretaries, Mesdames Kate Uline\r\nFolger, F. C. Bidwell, Hannah V. Best; treasurers, Mrs. Elizabeth M.\r\nWardall, Mrs. Marion L. Bennett, Mrs. Clara M. Williams; auditor, Mrs.\r\nJohn Davis; superintendents of literature, Mrs. Jane Rooker Breeden,\r\nMrs. Delia Robinson King.\r\n\r\n[210] The list of men and women who are not so widely known but who\r\nhave stood faithfully for woman suffrage would be a long one. Among\r\nthem are S. H. Cranmer, Rev. and Mrs. C. E. Hagar, Mrs. Alice Gossage,\r\nMrs. C. E. Thorpe, Mrs. Luella A. Ramsey, Mrs. Ruby Smart, Kara Smart\r\nand Floy Cochrane.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXII.\r\n\r\nDELAWARE.[211]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1884 the Republicans had a Ship of State called the\r\nNew Constitution, with an eagle on the top, which was mounted on\r\nwheels and taken from place to place where they held public meetings.\r\nWhen they came to Greenwood, the home of Mrs. Mary A. Stuart, she put\r\na \"blue hen\" upon it, saying they should not have an eagle to\r\nrepresent freedom for men and nothing to represent women. So the hen\r\nwent from one end of Delaware to the other, sitting in state in a\r\nglass coop. Some of the Republican speakers announced from the\r\nplatform this year that they favored enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the State Woman's Christian Temperance Union adopted the\r\nfranchise department with Mrs. Patience Kent as superintendent, and\r\nheld several public meetings. In 1889 Mrs. Martha S. Cranston was\r\nelected her successor, and still occupies the position.\r\n\r\nMrs. Rachel Foster Avery, corresponding secretary of the National\r\nAssociation, organized the Wilmington Equal Suffrage Club, the first\r\nin the State, on Nov. 18, 1895, with twenty-five members. The\r\nmembership soon increased to fifty-three.\r\n\r\nThe following winter Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the\r\nnational organization committee, sent into the State the Rev.\r\nHenrietta G. Moore of Ohio and Miss Mary G. Hay of New York, the\r\nlatter to arrange meetings and the former to address them and organize\r\nclubs. On Jan. 17, 18, 1896, they assisted in a convention at\r\nWilmington, where a State Association was formed.\r\n\r\nAs Delaware was to hold a Constitutional Convention in 1897, the\r\nNational Association was especially interested in pushing the suffrage\r\nwork there. Mrs. Chapman Catt met with the executive committee in\r\nWilmington to arrange plans, and Mrs. Mary C. C. Bradford of Colorado\r\nand Miss Laura A. Gregg of Kansas were sent during March and April to\r\nfurther organization. Three county associations were formed, and Mrs.\r\nHortense Davenport held parlor meetings in various towns throughout\r\nMay.\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 27, 1896, the second annual convention was held in the New\r\nCentury Club parlors in Wilmington. Judge William N. Ashman of\r\nPhiladelphia and Mrs. Mary Heald Way of Oxford, Penn., addressed the\r\naudience in the evening.\r\n\r\nPetitions were circulated throughout the State, and Mrs. Cranston and\r\nMiss Hay went to Dover to present the Constitutional Convention with a\r\nmemorial, which was referred to the Committee on Elections. It\r\ncontained the signatures of 1,592 men and 1,228 women. A hearing was\r\ngranted Jan. 13, 1897. Mrs. Emalea P. Warner, Mrs. Margaret W. Houston\r\nand Miss Emma Worrell made addresses. Mrs. Chapman Catt was the chief\r\nspeaker. Only two members of the committee were absent. A vote was\r\ntaken February 16 on omitting the word \"male\" from the new\r\nconstitution, and the proposition was defeated by 7 yeas, 17 nays,\r\nwith 6 not present.\r\n\r\nA national conference was held in Wilmington April 22, 23.\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt and the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, national\r\nvice-president-at-large, were the principal speakers, and Mrs.\r\nElizabeth G. Robinson, Mrs. Elizabeth Walling and Mrs. Houston\r\nassisted in making the meetings a success. On Sunday Miss Shaw\r\npreached in the Union M. E. Church in the morning and the Delaware\r\nAvenue Baptist Church in the evening.\r\n\r\nThe third State meeting took place at Wilmington, Dec. 2, 1897, with\r\naddresses by Miss Diana Hirschler of Boston and Mrs. C. O. H. Craigie\r\nof Brooklyn.\r\n\r\nThere was no convention in 1898, but the State association held a\r\nmeeting in the Unitarian Church, in Wilmington, Dec. 15, 1899, which\r\nwas addressed by Mrs. Chapman Catt.\r\n\r\nAfter the national convention in February, 1900, Mrs. Bradford made a\r\nfew addresses in the State. The annual meeting took place in\r\nNewcastle, Nov. 15, 1900. Among the speakers were Mrs. Ellen H. E.\r\nPrice of Pennsylvania and Professors William H. Purnell and Wesley\r\nWebb.\r\n\r\nMrs. Martha S. Cranston has been president of the State association,\r\nand Mrs. Margaret W. Houston vice-president, since its beginning.\r\nOthers who have served in official capacity are Mrs. Margaret H. Kent,\r\nEdward Mullen, Miss Emma Lore, Mrs. Mary R. De Vou and Mrs. May Price\r\nPhillips. Among those not previously mentioned who have given valuable\r\nassistance are Chief Justice Charles B. Lore and Mrs. Gertrude Nields.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: No bill for woman suffrage has been\r\npresented to the Legislature since 1881.\r\n\r\nOn the petition of women a law was passed in 1887 requiring employers\r\nto provide seats for female employes when not on duty.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 a police matron was appointed for Wilmington.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the Bastardy Law, which compelled the father of an\r\nillegitimate child to pay fifty cents a week for its support during\r\nseven years, was repealed; $3 a week for ten years were asked, but the\r\nlaw made it $1 a week for ten years.\r\n\r\nUntil 1889 the \"age of protection\" for girls was only seven years.\r\nThat year, on petition of many women, it was raised to fifteen, but\r\nthe violation of the law was declared to be only a \"misdemeanor,\"\r\npunishable by a fine of not more than $1,000 or imprisonment for not\r\nmore than seven years, or both, at the discretion of the court, with\r\nno minimum penalty named. In 1895 the Legislature, on the insistence\r\nof women, raised the \"age of protection\" to eighteen years, but\r\ncontinued to extend the \"protection\" to boys as well as girls. It has\r\nbeen found very difficult to secure the conviction of men for this\r\ncrime, and those convicted have been repeatedly pardoned by the\r\nGovernor.\r\n\r\nOn May 10, 1897, the Legislature passed a bill requiring the\r\nproprietors of mills, factories and stores in the city of Wilmington\r\nto provide comfortable toilet-rooms for their female employes, and one\r\ngiving power for the appointment of women as factory inspectors. One\r\nwas appointed by Chief Justice Lore the same year.\r\n\r\nIf there is a child or the lawful issue of a child living, the widow\r\nhas a life-interest in one-third of the real estate and one-third\r\nabsolutely of the personal property. If there is no child nor the\r\ndescendant of any child living, the widow has a life-interest in\r\none-half of the real estate and one-half absolutely of the personal\r\nestate. If there are neither descendants nor kin--brothers, sisters,\r\ntheir descendants, father nor mother--the widow has the entire real\r\nestate for her life, and all the personal estate absolutely. If a\r\nchild of the marriage was born alive, whether living or dead at the\r\ndeath of the wife, the widower has her entire real estate during his\r\nlife, and the whole of her personal estate absolutely, subject to all\r\nlegal claims. If there has not been a child born alive, the widower\r\nhas a life-interest in one-half of her real estate, but the whole of\r\nher personal estate absolutely.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the children, and he alone may\r\nappoint a guardian at his death.\r\n\r\nFor failure to support his wife and minor children, a man may be fined\r\nfrom $10 to $100; and, by Act of 1887, arrested and required to give\r\nbail not exceeding $500. The court may order him to pay reasonable\r\nsupport not exceeding $100 per month and give security to the State.\r\nIf he fail to comply, he may be committed to jail. The wife is\r\ncompetent as a witness.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: The women in Milford, Townsend, Wyoming and Newark who pay a\r\nproperty tax are privileged to vote for Town Commissioners in person\r\nor by proxy. All such women in the State may vote for School Trustees.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: In January, 1900, the Supreme Court denied the\r\napplication of a woman to practice at the bar, on the ground that a\r\nlawyer is a State officer and all State officers must be voters.\r\n\r\nIn the one city of Wilmington women are eligible as school directors,\r\nbut none ever has been elected.\r\n\r\nA woman factory inspector was appointed by the Chief Justice in 1897,\r\nand reappointed in 1900.\r\n\r\nWomen never have served as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: Only the practice of law is legally forbidden.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Delaware has one college, at Newark, which receives State\r\nfunds. Women were admitted in 1872, and during the next thirteen years\r\neighty availed themselves of its advantages. It was then closed to\r\nthem. The only High School in the State, at Wilmington, is open to\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nThere are in the public schools 211 men and 643 women teachers. It is\r\nimpossible to obtain their average salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[211] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Martha S.\r\nCranston of Newport, president of the State Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIII.\r\n\r\nDISTRICT OF COLUMBIA.[212]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe women of the District of Columbia who desire the suffrage have a\r\nunique place among those of other localities. As the franchise for men\r\neven is not included in the privileges of citizenship, all are\r\ncompelled to work circuitously through Congress in order to gain that\r\nwhich in the States is secured directly by the ballot. The suffrage\r\nsocieties stand in especially close relation to the National\r\nAssociation, as every year from 1869 until 1895, and each alternate\r\nyear since, they have served as its hosts and arranged the many\r\ndetails of its delegate conventions. Being near, also, to the great\r\nlegislative body of the nation they often serve as messengers and\r\nmediators between congressional committees and various State\r\norganizations of women.\r\n\r\nThe District, however, has its own vital problems to solve, and in\r\nthese the suffrage association takes a prominent part. Since 1883,\r\nthrough its organized and persistent efforts, alone or in co-operation\r\nwith other societies, many local reforms and improvements have been\r\nsecured. These have been unusually difficult to obtain because subject\r\nto the dual authority of Congress and of the District Commissioners.\r\nNevertheless, so systematically and harmoniously have the women worked\r\nthat the entire personnel of the association's committees has often\r\nbeen changed during the long delays in the introduction of a bill, the\r\nlobbying for it and its final passage, without in the least imperiling\r\nits success.\r\n\r\nThe District society never has languished since its organization in\r\n1868. Dr. Clara W. MacNaughton is now president and there are over one\r\nhundred active members.[213]\r\n\r\nThe Equal Suffrage Association of the District of Columbia is a\r\nseparate body, corresponding to a State association, and is composed\r\nof delegates elected from the District society and the Junior Equal\r\nSuffrage Club. It was organized Dec. 2, 1898, and holds regular\r\nmeetings. Mrs. Helen Rand Tindall is the president.[214]\r\n\r\nThe association made every possible effort to secure a bill to\r\nrecompense Anna Ella Carroll for her services during the war. It has\r\nused its influence in favor of industrial schools and kindergartens in\r\nthe public schools and has urged Congress to appropriate money for\r\nvacation schools. In 1895 it petitioned the national convention of the\r\nKnights of Labor, meeting in Washington, to adopt a resolution asking\r\nCongress to restore suffrage to the citizens of the District of\r\nColumbia with no distinction of sex. This was unanimously adopted\r\nwithout even the formality of referring to a committee. Delegates were\r\nsent to the International Congress of Women in Brussels in 1897.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, for the first time, the suffrage women of the District gave\r\nfree entertainment to delegates to the national convention. Mrs. Ellen\r\nPowell Thompson was chairman of the committee and contributed largely\r\nto the success of that memorable convention, which ended with the\r\ncelebration of Miss Susan B. Anthony's eightieth birthday and her\r\nretirement from the presidency of the National Association. Mrs.\r\nThompson was especially active in securing the handsome gift of a\r\npurse of over $200, which was presented to her by the District\r\nsociety. Mrs. Julius C. Burrows assisted in many ways and through her\r\ninfluence the Corcoran Gallery of Art was opened to the brilliant\r\nreception given in honor of Miss Anthony.\r\n\r\nAmong many who openly espouse woman suffrage are ex-Gov. and Mrs. John\r\nW. Hoyt of Wyoming, now living in Washington, Mrs. John B. Henderson,\r\nMrs. A. L. Barber, Mrs. Judith Ellen Foster, president of the Woman's\r\nRepublican Association of the United States, and Miss Clara Barton,\r\nfounder and president of the National Red Cross Society; to whom might\r\nbe added hosts of others.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: The suffrage association has been largely\r\ninstrumental in securing most of the District legislation in favor of\r\nwomen, as the records of the past twenty years will show. What is\r\nregarded as the most important achievement of this nature since 1884\r\nis the passage by Congress, in 1896, of the Married Woman's Property\r\nRights Bill.\r\n\r\nThe removal of the disabilities of wives had been agitated for a\r\nnumber of years by the association. In 1893 a bill for this purpose,\r\ndrafted by one of its members, Miss Emma M. Gillett, attorney-at-law,\r\nwas passed by the Senate. When it reached the House it went through\r\nthe usual stages, was tossed about from one committee to another and\r\ndeferred and delayed in the most exasperating manner. It was\r\nchampioned by Miss Gillett, however, with an unswerving courage and\r\nfidelity which never allowed it to be forgotten or neglected, and she\r\nwas treated always with the utmost courtesy when appearing before\r\ncongressional committees.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Mrs. Ellen Spencer Mussey, always an ardent suffragist, as\r\nchairman of the committee on legislation for the District Federation\r\nof Women's Clubs, began a vigorous prosecution of this bill before\r\nCongress. Miss Gillett and Mrs. Mussey were ably assisted by Mrs.\r\nBelva A. Lockwood, Mrs. Lucia B. Blount, Mrs. M. E. Coues and Mrs.\r\nMary S. Lockwood.\r\n\r\nAt this time married women had no legal right to hold property, and in\r\nmost respects the District laws remained about as arbitrary as they\r\nwere in the reign of King Charles II. A mother had no right by law to\r\nher own child, the father having legal sanction to dispose of the\r\noffspring even before it was born. At the time this committee was\r\nurging Congress to pass the bill, the public was horrified by a\r\nnotorious case in the courts of the District in which a profligate\r\nfather, who had never done anything to benefit his children, had\r\ndisposed of them by will, debarring the mother from their custody and\r\ncontrol. This cruelty and injustice was an object-lesson which\r\nespecially evoked the sympathy of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe bill finally passed both Houses, was approved by President William\r\nMcKinley, and became a law June 1, 1896. At a special meeting, held\r\nJune 11, Mrs. Belva A. Lockwood presented the association with an\r\nengrossed copy of the new law, and the women held a jubilee to\r\ncelebrate their victory.\r\n\r\nThe law provides that the real, personal or mixed property which shall\r\ncome to a woman by descent, purchase, gift, etc., shall be and remain\r\nher sole and separate property, notwithstanding her marriage, and\r\nshall not be subject to the disposal of her husband or be liable for\r\nhis debts.\r\n\r\nA married woman may bargain, sell and convey her real and personal\r\nproperty, enter into any contract, sue and be sued the same as a\r\nmarried man.\r\n\r\nA married woman may carry on any business or enter any profession, by\r\nherself or with others, and the proceeds shall be her separate\r\nproperty and may be invested in her own name.\r\n\r\nThe law also provides that the father and mother shall be equal\r\nguardians of their children, and that the survivor may by last will\r\nand testament appoint a guardian.\r\n\r\nThe husband, if he have property, is required by a recent decision to\r\nfurnish his family with reasonable support; otherwise there is no\r\npenalty for failure to do so.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy obtain. The widow's dower is one-third for life of\r\nthe real estate, and one-third of the personal estate absolutely if\r\nthere is a child or descendant of any living. If there is no issue or\r\ndescendant of any, but father, mother, brother, sister or descendants\r\nof these, the widow has one-half the personal estate. If none of\r\nthese, the widow may have all of the personal estate, and all of the\r\nreal estate if there is no kindred whatever. A widower, if his wife\r\nhas borne a living child, is entitled to the use of one-third of her\r\nreal estate for life, and one-third of her personal property. If there\r\nare no heirs, lineal or collateral, he takes the whole estate\r\nabsolutely.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised in 1889 from 12 to 16\r\nyears. The penalty is, for the first offense imprisonment at hard\r\nlabor in the penitentiary not more than fifteen years, and for each\r\nsubsequent offense not more than thirty years. No minimum penalty is\r\nfixed.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Since the Territorial government was abolished and male\r\ncitizens disfranchised, in 1874, there have been numerous petitions to\r\nCongress for the ballot by both men and women, but no action has been\r\ntaken by that body.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Through the early '80's Mrs. Belva A. Lockwood, Mrs.\r\nJane H. Spofford and others worked unceasingly for the placing of\r\nmatrons at the jail and police stations. One was appointed in 1884,\r\nand, during the sixteen years since, a matron has been secured for the\r\njail and three for the ten police stations, largely through the\r\nefforts of the suffragists and especially of Mrs. Ellen Powell\r\nThompson, president of the District Association. The women have had\r\nthe hearty support of Major Richard Sylvester, Chief of Police.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 an act was passed for a Board of Guardians for Dependent\r\nChildren, of which at least three of the nine members must be women.\r\n\r\nPrincipally to the efforts of Mrs. Sara A. Spencer, with the help of\r\nother members of the association, is due the bill providing for a\r\nGirl's Reform School, in 1892. The board of managers has always been\r\ncomposed of men, but there are a woman superintendent and a woman\r\nphysician.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lockwood and Mrs. Elizabeth A. Russell worked long and arduously\r\nto secure a House of Detention and also a special carriage and a\r\nspecial court for the women and children arrested. To Major Sylvester\r\nabove all others, however, belongs the credit of securing this House\r\nof Detention. Senator James McMillan of Michigan, chairman of the\r\nCommittee on the District of Columbia, framed the bill and it was\r\nfinally transformed into law. This house was opened in the summer of\r\n1900. A Lieutenant of Police and three matrons have charge, under\r\nsupervision of the Chief.\r\n\r\nMrs. Marilla M. Ricker was made notary public and master in chancery\r\nin 1885, and Miss Emma M. Gillett soon afterward. They secured the\r\nlegislation necessary for women to hold the latter office. There are\r\nat present four or five women masters in chancery and twenty women\r\nnotaries in the District.\r\n\r\nIt required six years of agitation and effort on the part of the\r\nsuffrage association before women were allowed to serve as members on\r\nthe Board of Public School Education. The principal movers in this\r\nwork were Dr. Clara W. MacNaughton, Mrs. Thompson, Mrs. Helen Rand\r\nTindall, Mrs. Lockwood and Mrs. Caroline E. Kent. During this time the\r\nbill passed through many vicissitudes and its friends became\r\ndiscouraged, but in 1894 Dr. MacNaughton went to work with a strong\r\ndetermination to secure its passage. Great assistance was rendered by\r\nSenator McMillan and the Hon. Edwin F. Uhl, at that time Assistant\r\nSecretary of State. The bill was finally passed just before Congress\r\nadjourned for that year. The school board, which has charge of both\r\nwhite and colored schools, consists of five members, each with a\r\nsalary of $500 a year. Mrs. Mary C. Terrill (colored) served five\r\nyears and resigned. She was succeeded by Mrs. Betty G. Francis\r\n(colored). Mrs. Mary Hope West (white) is the other woman member. A\r\nwoman is serving as assistant superintendent of the public schools,\r\nreceiving $2,500 per annum; and a woman is employed as assistant\r\nsecretary of the Board of Education.\r\n\r\nWomen sit on the Hospital Boards and those of Public Charities. It\r\nnever has been possible to secure the appointment of women physicians\r\nat any of the hospitals or asylums.\r\n\r\nAs women are admitted to the various Government Departments there\r\nnaturally would be more of them holding office in the District of\r\nColumbia than in all the States combined. The relative number of men\r\nand women employed is as follows:\r\n\r\n  _LEGISLATIVE._\r\n\r\n                                                 _Male._ _Female._\r\n\r\n  Senate, officers and employes                     382            3\r\n  House of Representatives, officers and employes   272          ...\r\n  Capitol Police                                     65          ...\r\n  Library of Congress                               216          151\r\n  United States Botanic Garden                       28          ...\r\n                                                   ----         ----\r\n                                                    963          154\r\n\r\n                         _EXECUTIVE._\r\n\r\n  Executive Office                                   28          ...\r\n  State Department                                   92           17\r\n  Treasury Department                             3,234        2,313\r\n  War Department[215]                               2,411          300\r\n  Navy Department[216]                              2,992           85\r\n  Postoffice Department                             812          237\r\n  Interior Department                             4,810        2,862\r\n  Department of Justice                             191           21\r\n  Department of Agriculture                         650          332\r\n  Government Printing Office                      2,623        1,068\r\n  Department of Labor                                74           10\r\n  Fish Commission                                    55           12\r\n  Interstate Commerce Commission                    133          ...\r\n  Civil Service Commission                           55            6\r\n  Industrial Commission                              10            7\r\n  Smithsonian Institution                           320           39\r\n  Bureau of American Republics                       13            9\r\n  Local Postoffices in District                     606           22\r\n                                                   ----         ----\r\n                                                 19,109        7,340\r\n\r\n                        _JUDICIAL._\r\n\r\n  Supreme Court of the United States                 12          ...\r\n  Court of Claims                                    25            2\r\n                                                   ----         ----\r\n                                                     37            2\r\n\r\n                        _SUMMARY._\r\n\r\n                                                 20,109        7,496\r\n\r\nWhether the number of women is increasing or decreasing is a disputed\r\nquestion. The Civil Service alone enables them to hold their places or\r\nto secure new ones against the tremendous pressure for the offices\r\nwhich is brought upon the appointing powers by the men who form the\r\nvoting constituency of the country. Chiefs of the Divisions rarely\r\ncall for a woman on the Civil Service list of eligibles.\r\n\r\nFew women fill the highly salaried positions. One woman receives\r\n$2,500 as Portuguese translator; one, working in the U. S. Land Office\r\nat Lander, Wyoming, receives the same. One secured a $2,250 position\r\nin the Federal Postoffice Department but was soon reduced to an $1,800\r\nplace and her own given to a man. The salaries of women in general\r\nrange from $900 to $1,600, not more than fifty receiving the latter\r\nsum, while many hundreds of men clerks receive $1,800. Clerkships\r\nunder Civil Service rules are supposed to pay the same to men and\r\nwomen, but the latter rarely secure the better-paid ones. There are a\r\nlarge number of positions graded above clerkships and paying from\r\n$2,000 to $3,000 a year to which women are practically never\r\nappointed.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No professions or occupations are forbidden to women. Two\r\nof the pioneer women physicians in the United States made name and\r\nfame in Washington--Dr. Caroline B. Winslow and Dr. Susan A.\r\nEdson--the latter the attending physician during the last illness of\r\nPresident James A. Garfield.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Howard University, for white and colored students, is the\r\nonly one which graduates women in medicine. In all of its ten\r\ndepartments, including law, it is co-educational. Columbian University\r\n(Baptist) opens its literary departments to women but excludes them\r\nfrom those of law and medicine, which are its strongest\r\ndepartments.[217] They were admitted to the Medical School in 1884,\r\nbut excluded in 1892 on the ground that the university could not\r\nafford to have professors for separate classes and that the buildings\r\nwere too small for the increased number of students.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ellen S. Mussey and Miss Emma M. Gillett, in 1896, established\r\nthe Washington College of Law for the legal education of women. Mrs.\r\nMussey has been the dean since its organization and is the only woman\r\ndean of a law school in the country. The Hon. Edward F. Bingham, Chief\r\nJustice of the Supreme Court of the District, is president of the\r\nboard of trustees, and leading members of the bar have used their\r\ninfluence to make the college a success. The curriculum is the same as\r\nobtains in the leading institutions. There are several men among the\r\nstudents. Mrs. Mussey is counsel for the Red Cross Society.\r\n\r\nThe American University (Methodist Episcopal), now being organized for\r\npost-graduate work, is to be co-educational.\r\n\r\nThe great Catholic Universities, here, as everywhere, are closed to\r\nwomen. Trinity College for Women (Roman Catholic) was dedicated Nov.\r\n22, 1900. The necessity for this college became apparent from their\r\nmany applications to enter the universities for men. It is the first\r\ninstitution founded by this church for the higher education of women\r\nsuch as is provided by the largest of the women's colleges in the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThere are in the public schools 155 men and 1,004 women teachers. The\r\naverage monthly salary of the men is $94.48; of the women, $64.31.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Kindergartens into the public schools received the\r\nassistance of all the women's societies in the District. In 1898 a\r\nbill passed Congress appropriating $15,000 with which to make the\r\nexperiment. This proving successful an annual appropriation of $25,000\r\nwas made.[218]\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Christian Temperance Union, Mrs. Clinton Smith, president,\r\nhas secured the suppression of liquor selling in the café of the new\r\nLibrary of Congress, and a large number of most beneficent measures.\r\nIn December, 1900, the national convention of the W. C. T. U. was held\r\nin Washington and among the strongest resolutions adopted were those\r\ndeclaring for woman suffrage and the abolishment of the army canteen.\r\nA bill for the latter purpose passed the House while the convention\r\nwas in session, and soon afterwards passed the Senate.\r\n\r\nThe District Federation of Women's Clubs includes eleven affiliated\r\norganizations comprising nearly four thousand women.\r\n\r\nMrs. Julius C. Burrows (Mich.) is among the most prominent of the many\r\nwomen engaged in philanthropic work. Largely under her direction the\r\nTraining School for Nurses connected with the Garfield Memorial\r\nHospital has become one of the best in the country.\r\n\r\nMrs. Clara Bewick Colby has long owned and published the _Woman's\r\nTribune_. Mrs. Mary S. Lockwood for a number of years has edited the\r\n_American Magazine_, the official organ of the National Society\r\nDaughters of the American Revolution. Mrs. Belva A. Lockwood is\r\nassociate editor of _The Peacemaker_.\r\n\r\nDr. Anita Newcombe McGee was the first woman in the United States\r\ncommissioned as surgeon, with the rank of lieutenant and the privilege\r\nof wearing shoulder straps. She examined most of the women nurses who\r\nvolunteered their services in Cuba and the Philippines.\r\n\r\nAll of the women mentioned above are members of the suffrage\r\nassociation, and those engaged in public work of all kinds are, almost\r\nwithout exception, advocates of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nDuring the Spanish-American War the women of the District, including\r\nthe Daughters of the American Revolution, the Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union and the District Federation of Women's Clubs, united\r\nin their services. Pleasant headquarters were opened in different\r\nlocalities. Mrs. Judith Ellen Foster, Mrs. James B. Tanner and many\r\nother loyal Red Cross women answered the call of Clara Barton, and\r\nassisted daily through the long, hot summer of 1898 in contributing to\r\nthe comfort of the soldiers when passing through Washington or while\r\nstationed at Camp Alger; and also in sending supplies for the comfort\r\nof those at the front. There were no castes, creeds or factions in\r\nthis great work of patriotism.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[212] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Florence Adele\r\nChase, for a number of years on the editorial staff of a daily paper\r\nat Grand Rapids, Mich., now on the editorial force in the Division of\r\nPublications of the Agricultural Department at Washington, the only\r\nwoman who has held the position.\r\n\r\n[213] The presidents since 1884 have been Mrs. Ruth G. Denison, Dr.\r\nSusan A. Edson, Mrs. Ella M. S. Marble, Mrs. Mary L. Bennett, Mrs.\r\nMary Powell Davis, Mrs. Ellen Powell Thompson, Miss Cora La Matyr\r\nThomas and Mrs. Helen Rand Tindall.\r\n\r\nOn March 18, 1901, the association was incorporated by Clara W.\r\nMacNaughton, Mary L. Talbott, Ellen Powell Thompson, Helen Rand\r\nTindall, Clara Bewick Colby, Kate W. Burt, Sara A. Haslett, Caroline\r\nE. Kent and Belva A. Lockwood, \"to secure for women citizens of the\r\nUnited States the full rights of citizenship; to build a clubhouse for\r\nwomen; and to collect funds for appropriate memorials to the memory of\r\nwomen who have performed meritorious work for the enfranchisement of\r\nwomen and the good of humanity.\"\r\n\r\n[214] The Junior Equal Suffrage Club is probably the first\r\norganization of young people to become affiliated with the National\r\nAssociation. It was founded Jan. 24, 1895, by three girls in the\r\nCentral High School, Anna Kemball, Alice Stearns and Edith Maddren.\r\nYoung men comprise about one-third of its membership and join in its\r\nproceedings and discussions.\r\n\r\n[215] Not including 71 officers of the U. S. Army on duty at the War\r\nDepartment.\r\n\r\n[216] Not including 37 officers U. S. Navy and 4 officers U. S. Marine\r\nCorps on duty at Navy Department.\r\n\r\n[217] In 1901 women graduates were admitted as special students to\r\nlecture courses in the graduate department, known as the National\r\nSchool of Jurisprudence and Diplomacy, by a special vote of the\r\ntrustees in each case, but no general rule has been made.\r\n\r\n[218] The Senate committee included Senators Allison, Cullom, Gorman,\r\nQuay and Cockrell. When Mrs. Mussey appeared before them to ask for a\r\nnew appropriation, after the trial had proved a success, she stated\r\nthat she was about to ask something for that which is the most\r\nprecious to every woman's heart--a little child. The Senators at once\r\ndeclared that a little child was also the dearest thing on earth to a\r\nman's heart, and unanimously recommended the appropriation.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIV.\r\n\r\nFLORIDA.[219]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe brief history of work in Florida for the enfranchisement of women\r\ngathers about the name of Mrs. Ella C. Chamberlain. She returned to\r\nher home in Tampa from attendance on the Woman's Inter-State\r\nConference at Des Moines in the autumn of 1892, and secured space for\r\na suffrage department in the principal paper of that city. In January,\r\n1893, she presented the question so forcibly at a social gathering, as\r\na woman taxpayer, that a gentleman suggested forming a society and\r\ntwenty members were secured, eight of them men. Mrs. Chamberlain was\r\nmade president; O. G. Sexton, secretary; Miss Stowell, treasurer.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the president addressed the Carpenters' Union twice, and\r\nconsiderable literature was distributed. In December the suffragists\r\nof Tampa, aided by those of Melrose, held a bazar which netted $125.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1895, a State convention was held in Tampa and the\r\nfollowing officers were elected: President, Mrs. Chamberlain;\r\nvice-presidents, Mesdames E. W. King, Emma Tebbitts, Jessie M.\r\nBartlett; secretary, Miss Nellie Glenn; treasurer, J. L. Cae. During\r\nthe year Mrs. Chamberlain gave addresses at the De Funiak Springs\r\nAssembly, the Adventists' Campmeeting and in various towns. The\r\nsociety paid dues to the National Association until 1897, when the\r\npresident removed from the State, no one came forward to take the\r\nleadership and the movement has since languished.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: Until 1901 the women never had a bill\r\nbefore the Legislature, although the W. C. T. U. aided greatly in\r\nsecuring the State Reform School. Its influence also was strongly used\r\nagainst a Dispensary Bill.\r\n\r\nSome men and many women had long felt that the law placing the \"age of\r\nconsent\" for girls at 10 years was a disgrace to the State. In 1887 W.\r\nB. Lamar (now Attorney-General) presented a bill raising it to 17\r\nyears, but this was defeated.\r\n\r\nFlorida makes a distinction between \"age of consent\" and \"age of\r\nprotection.\" Up to 10 years the crime is rape and the penalty is death\r\nor imprisonment for life. The law \"protects\" girls until 16 to the\r\nextent of a penalty of imprisonment not more than one year or a fine\r\nnot exceeding $500, with no minimum fixed. Several attempts were made\r\nby the W. C. T. U. to have both ages changed to 18 years, but bills\r\nfor this purpose always were laid on the table.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 this organization, under the leadership of Mrs. C. S.\r\nBurnett-Haney, its superintendent of purity, began a thorough and\r\nsystematic canvass of the State to secure such a petition for raising\r\nthe age as it would be impossible for the Legislature to ignore. For\r\nthis 15,000 signatures of representative men and women were obtained,\r\nbesides the official indorsement of U. S. Senators Stephen R. Mallory\r\nand James P. Taliaferro, Congressmen S. M. Sparkman and Robert W.\r\nDavis, four Judges of the Circuit Court, with many other Judges,\r\nattorneys and city officers; also those of Presidents W. F. Yocum of\r\nthe State Agricultural College, G. M. Ward of Rollins College, John F.\r\nForbes of Stetson University, the State Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction and over 100 other leading educators. The petition\r\nreceived also the unanimous indorsement of the State Press Association\r\nand the State Medical Association, and the signatures of 100\r\nphysicians, including every member of the State Medical Board.\r\n\r\nIn the hope of at least a measure of success two bills were\r\nintroduced, one raising the \"age of consent\" from 10 to 14 years, and,\r\nas it had been found practically impossible to secure a conviction\r\nunder the existing penalty, to reduce this to a term of imprisonment.\r\nThis bill was presented and championed in the House by R. H. Burr, the\r\nage was raised to 16 years and the bill passed unanimously, May 17. In\r\nthe Senate it was indefinitely postponed.\r\n\r\nThe second bill asked that the \"age of protection\" be raised from 16\r\nto 18 years, and that the penalty be increased to imprisonment from\r\none to twenty years or a fine of from $500 to $2,000. This bill also\r\nwas advocated by Mr. Burr and passed the House May 17, but with no\r\nminimum penalty. The vote stood 26 ayes, 20 noes.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate every possible means was adopted to prevent this bill\r\nfrom reaching a vote, and it was only by the determined efforts of E.\r\nN. Dimick, and all the influence which the W. C. T. U. could bring to\r\nbear, that it finally was passed the last day of the session, May 31,\r\nwith but two dissenting votes, although a number of senators absented\r\nthemselves. It was signed the same day by Gov. William S. Jennings.\r\n\r\nThus as the result of all this great canvass, the expenditure of much\r\ntime and money and the assistance of the best elements in the\r\ncommunity, a child of 10 years may still consent to her own ruin in\r\nFlorida, and the age at which the law will give any protection\r\nwhatever was raised only two years. The penalty which may be inflicted\r\nwas increased, but by the refusal to fix a minimum of fine or\r\nimprisonment there is but a slight improvement over the original\r\nstatus.\r\n\r\nIf over 16 each of the parties may be punished by imprisonment not\r\nexceeding three months or a fine not exceeding $30.\r\n\r\nAll property of the wife, real or personal, owned by her before\r\nmarriage or lawfully acquired afterward, by gift, bequest or purchase,\r\nis her separate estate and is not liable for the debts of the husband\r\nwithout her written consent in legal form. It remains, however, under\r\nhis care and management, but he can not charge for these, nor can she\r\ncompel him to account for its rents, proceeds or profits.\r\n\r\nThe wife can not transfer her real or personal property without the\r\nhusband's joinder. If he has been insane one year she can convey or\r\ntransfer without his signature. Any married woman who may wish to take\r\ncharge of her estate, and become a free dealer in every respect, must\r\napply to the court for a license. Since 1891 a married woman's\r\nearnings acquired by any employment aside from the household are her\r\nseparate property.\r\n\r\nDower but not curtesy prevails. The widow has the life use of\r\none-third of the real estate and, if there are no children or but one\r\nchild, she has one-half the personal estate absolutely; if more than\r\none, she has one-third. If there are no children and no will she takes\r\nthe whole estate, real and personal. If the wife die without a will,\r\nand the husband but no descendants survive her, the whole of her\r\nestate goes to him; but if there are children or their descendants,\r\nthe estate, both real and personal, descends in distribution to them.\r\nThe homestead, to the extent of 160 acres of land in the country or a\r\nhalf-acre in town, is exempt from seizure for debt.\r\n\r\nA married woman may dispose of her property, both real and personal,\r\nby last will and testament in the same manner as if she were\r\nunmarried.\r\n\r\nThe father has legal control of the persons, education and property of\r\nthe children, and he alone may appoint a guardian by will, during any\r\npart of infancy.\r\n\r\nThe husband is required by law to support his family and, on his\r\nfailure to do so, the court may make such orders as are necessary. If\r\nliving separate from him, the wife may sue for alimony without divorce\r\nif legal cause exist.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women possess no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women are not eligible to any office, elective or\r\nappointive, except that they may serve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: Women have been admitted to the practice of law in a few\r\njudicial circuits, but none have been admitted into the medical\r\nprofession. No other occupation is legally forbidden.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All of the institutions of learning are open alike to both\r\nsexes.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 1,121 men and 1,671 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $35; of the women, $32.40.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[219] The History is indebted to Mrs. C. S. Burnett-Haney of Stuart,\r\nsuperintendent of purity for the State Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion, for much of the information in this chapter.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXV.\r\n\r\nGEORGIA.[220]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first woman suffrage association of Georgia was organized in July,\r\n1890, by Miss H. Augusta Howard and her sister, Miss Claudia Hope\r\nHoward (Maxwell). For some time the membership was composed only of\r\nthese two, their mother, Mrs. Anne Jane Lindsay Howard, and other\r\nrelatives, all residents of Columbus. Mr. and Mrs. D. M. Allen of\r\nDouglasville were the first outside the Howard family to encourage and\r\nsupport the infant organization. In 1892 Mrs. Kate Mallette Hardwick\r\nand Mrs. Mary L. McLendon became members, and served for several years\r\nas auditor and vice-president.\r\n\r\nThe Atlanta association was organized in the Marietta Street M. E.\r\nChurch, March 21, 1894, by Mrs. McLendon and Mrs. Margaret Chandler;\r\nperfected in the Unitarian Church on March 28, and begun with a\r\nmembership of forty men and women.\r\n\r\nIn the latter part of 1895, Miss Howard and Mrs. Maxwell, who had\r\nserved continuously as president, secretary and treasurer of the State\r\nassociation, resigned their offices; and Mrs. Frances Cater Swift was\r\nelected president; Mrs. U. O. Robertson, secretary; Miss Adelaide\r\nWilson, treasurer.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Mrs. McLendon was made president; Mrs. S. L. Ober Allen and\r\nMrs. Ala Holmes Cheney, vice-presidents; Dr. L. D. Morse,\r\ncorresponding secretary; Mrs. Gertrude C. Thomas, recording secretary;\r\nMiss Sarah A. Gresham, treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention of the National Association, which was held in\r\nthe opera house in Atlanta the first week of February, 1895, gave a\r\nnew impetus to the movement in Georgia.[221] Men and women throughout\r\nthe State felt its widespreading influence. Many ancient Southern\r\nprejudices received a death-blow when those who harbored them saw what\r\nmanner of women had espoused this hitherto unpopular cause.[222]\r\n\r\nAll the Atlanta papers extended a cordial greeting to the convention\r\nand devoted columns of space to biographical sketches, reports of\r\nmeetings, etc., but the _Sunny South_, edited by Col. Henry Clay\r\nFairman, was the only one which editorially indorsed the suffrage\r\nmovement. The business manager of the Atlanta _Constitution_, William\r\nA. Hemphill, and his wife, tendered a large reception to the members\r\nof the convention.\r\n\r\nF. H. Richardson, editor of the Atlanta _Journal_, the largest evening\r\npaper in the State, was converted to a belief in woman suffrage at\r\nthis time, and is now an honorary member of the organization. As a\r\npart of his work, he has made an earnest and long-continued effort to\r\nhave women placed on the school board.[223]\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Board of the Cotton States and International Exposition,\r\nsoon to be held in Atlanta, were so impressed by the _personnel_ of\r\nthis convention that an official invitation was extended for them to\r\nhold a Suffrage Day on Oct. 17, 1895, in the Woman's Congress Assembly\r\nHall. This was accepted by Miss Anthony on behalf of the National\r\nAssociation, and under the guiding hand of Mrs. Rachel Foster Avery,\r\nits corresponding secretary, Suffrage Day was one of the very best of\r\nthe many days celebrated during the Woman's Congress. The State\r\nassociation also fitted up a booth in the Liberal Arts Building and\r\nlarge quantities of literature were distributed by Mrs. H. M. Tripp,\r\nwho kindly took charge.\r\n\r\nThe first State convention was held in Atlanta, Nov. 28, 29, 1899. The\r\nfollowing resolution, offered in the Legislature by Representative\r\nMartin V. Calvin, was adopted: \"The use of the Hall of the House of\r\nRepresentatives is hereby granted to Mrs. Virginia D. Young of South\r\nCarolina, Miss Frances A. Griffin of Alabama, and Mrs. Isabella Webb\r\nParks of Georgia, on the 28th inst., for the purpose of delivering\r\nlectures on the scope of the elective franchise.\"[224]\r\n\r\nThe first evening session was held in the State capitol. Mrs.\r\nMcLendon, the president, called the meeting to order. The address of\r\nwelcome for Georgia was made by Mrs. Thomas; for Atlanta, by its\r\npresident, Mrs. Swift; Miss Gresham responded to both. Mrs. Young,\r\nMiss Griffin, Mrs. Maxwell and Mrs. Parks delivered addresses to a\r\nlarge and interested audience.[225]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In 1888 the Hon. Augustus Dupont applied\r\nto the Legislature for a city charter for the town of Dupont, and\r\nsought to secure suffrage to all persons, male or female, owning\r\nproperty in the corporation, but failed.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 the Atlanta association presented two bills to the\r\nLegislature--one to raise the \"age of protection\" for girls from 10 to\r\n18 years; the other, drawn by Charles A. Reid, a member of the society\r\nand an able lawyer, to take the necessary measures for granting equal\r\nlegal and political rights to women. Neither was reported from the\r\ncommittees.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Representative Martin V. Calvin introduced a bill to make a\r\nwoman eligible to serve on the staff of physicians at the State insane\r\nasylum, but it failed to pass.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 an effort was made to secure a bill providing police matrons\r\nin every city of 10,000 or more inhabitants, and one to exempt the\r\nproperty of women from taxation until they should be permitted to\r\nvote. Both failed.\r\n\r\nMiss Frances A. Griffin appeared for the Georgia W. S. A. at the\r\nconvention of the State Federation of Labor, held in Augusta in April,\r\n1900, and in response to her address it called on its members to\r\ndemand a change in the United States Constitution which should secure\r\nthe legal and political equality of women. A strong suffrage plank was\r\nadded to the platform of the federation, and Miss Griffin was invited\r\nby it to address the Legislature in the interest of the Child Labor\r\nBill, which it had championed so unsuccessfully for a number of years.\r\n\r\nOne result of the State suffrage convention held in Atlanta in 1899,\r\nwas that the following petitions were ordered to be circulated and\r\nreturned for presentation to the legislative committees in the fall of\r\n1900:\r\n\r\n     1. That the University of Georgia be opened to women.\r\n\r\n     2. That women be members of the boards of education.\r\n\r\n     3. That women physicians be placed on the staff of the State\r\n     insane asylum.\r\n\r\n     4. That women be made eligible to the office of president of the\r\n     State Normal and Industrial College for Girls.\r\n\r\n     5. That the \"age of protection\" for girls be raised from 10 to 18\r\n     years.\r\n\r\n     6. That girls of eighteen be permitted to enter the textile\r\n     department of the State Technological School.\r\n\r\nFour bills were considered by the Legislature of 1900 in which the\r\nwomen of the State were deeply interested. All failed, and many of\r\nthem now see that Legislatures, like juries, should be composed of an\r\nequal number of men and women to secure exact justice for both.\r\n\r\nThe Child Labor Bills, introduced by Representative Seaborn Wright and\r\nC. C. Houston, to prevent the employment in factories of children\r\nunder ten and under twelve years of age were defeated by a vote of\r\nmore than three to one.\r\n\r\nThe Textile Bill was read twice in the House but failed to secure a\r\nthird reading. Lyman Hall, president of the school, was in favor of\r\nthe bill.\r\n\r\nThe Age of Protection Bill, introduced by Representative C. S. Reid,\r\nwas very quietly handled. Only one paper (the Atlanta _Daily News_)\r\ninformed the public that it would be made the special order for\r\nNovember 15. It was defeated by 71 ayes, 77 noes. At the request of\r\nwomen Mr. Reid moved that it be reconsidered November 16, which\r\nresulted in its being voted down by a larger majority than the day\r\nbefore. Mr. Reid thought it well that his bill was defeated, since it\r\nonly asked that the \"age of protection\" be raised from 10 to 12 years.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists asked that it be raised from 10 to 18, and the Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union from 10 to 21. Many petitions had been sent\r\nto previous Legislatures by both these organizations, but this was the\r\nfirst time a bill had been presented and carried to a vote.\r\n\r\nThe bill to admit women to the State University was not considered by\r\nthe Legislature of 1900.[226]\r\n\r\nThe State W. C. T. U. has been laboring to secure the passage of a law\r\nfor scientific temperance instruction in the public schools since\r\n1890, when Mrs. Mary H. Hunt of Massachusetts, who was the first woman\r\nto speak in the capitol building, addressed the Legislature. The bill\r\npassed both Houses in 1894, but was vetoed by Gov. William J. Northen\r\nbecause no provision had been made to require teachers to stand an\r\nexamination on the subject.[227]\r\n\r\nSince 1857, when the law which gave a husband the right to whip his\r\nwife was amended, there have been some favorable changes. In 1866 a\r\nlaw was enacted allowing a married woman to own property, but not\r\nincluding any wages she might earn.\r\n\r\nIn 1891, when a married woman was suing for personal injury in a\r\nrailroad accident, Chief Justice Logan E. Bleckley decided that the\r\namount of a wife's recovery for physical damages \"is not to be\r\nmeasured by pecuniary earnings, for such earnings as a general rule\r\nbelong to the husband and the right of action for this loss is in\r\nhim.\" In 1892 Judge Thomas J. Simmons rendered practically the same\r\ndecision, and in 1893 ruled again: \"Inasmuch as the earnings of the\r\nwife belong to her husband, her individual and personal damages can be\r\nmeasured only by the consciences of an impartial jury.\"\r\n\r\nIn November, 1895, when William H. Flemming (now a member of Congress)\r\nwas Speaker of the House of Representatives, he offered a bill which,\r\nas he said, \"was to complete the good work begun with the Married\r\nWoman's Property Act of 1866, by making a wife's labor as well as her\r\nacquired property her own.\" It passed the House by 98 ayes, 29 noes,\r\nbut was killed in the Senate.\r\n\r\nAs the law now stands a married woman in Georgia can control her\r\nearnings only if a sole trader with her husband's consent by notice\r\npublished in the papers for one month, or if living separate from him.\r\n\r\nDower obtains but not curtesy. If a husband die intestate, leaving a\r\nwife and issue, the wife may elect to take dower--a life interest in\r\none-third of the real estate--or she may take a child's share of the\r\nwhole estate absolutely, unless the shares exceed five in number, when\r\nshe may have one-fifth.\r\n\r\nThe father is legally entitled to the custody and control of the\r\nchildren, and at his death may appoint a guardian to the exclusion of\r\nthe mother. The husband must furnish necessities for the family\r\nsuitable to their station in life.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls still remains 10 years, with a\r\npenalty of death, or if recommended to mercy by the jury, imprisonment\r\nin the penitentiary at hard labor not less than one nor more than\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women have no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: In December, 1884, Representative Martin V. Calvin\r\nintroduced and carried through the Legislature, under most unfavorable\r\npressure, a bill to render women eligible to employment in the State\r\nHouse. Besides the large number engaged in manual labor, a woman is\r\nnow postmaster of the House of Representatives, and many others are\r\nemployed as stenographers, typewriters and engrossing clerks, the\r\nGovernor himself having a woman stenographer.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Representative J. E. Mosley succeeded in having an ancient law\r\namended, by which women were made eligible to the position of State\r\nlibrarian; but none has been appointed, although one is now assistant.\r\n\r\nIn the opinion of State School Commissioner G. R. Glenn, women are\r\neligible to sit on School Boards, but none ever has done so. Within\r\nthe past two years the Board of Education in Atlanta has appointed a\r\nBoard of Women Visitors to the public schools, but they can exercise\r\nno authority. Lately they have been permitted to be present at the\r\nmeetings of the board as listeners but they can have no voice.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1895, a committee, Mrs. F. S. Whiteside, chairman, appeared\r\nbefore the city council of Atlanta with a petition asking for a police\r\nmatron, signed by more than 1,000 well-known citizens. On the same day\r\na committee of the W. C. T. U., Mrs. McLendon, chairman, presented a\r\nsimilar petition from temperance people.[228] The matter was referred\r\nto the police committee, who \"laid it on the table\" and it never was\r\nheard from afterward.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 a woman was employed by the Ladies' Society of the First M. E.\r\nChurch South to stay at police barracks and serve as matron. In May,\r\n1898, she was engaged by the city at a salary of $20 per month, but\r\nwas dismissed without warning in June of the same year. The different\r\norganizations of women protested so vigorously that the position of\r\npolice matron was created by the city council with a salary of $40 per\r\nmonth, but no matron has been appointed up to date.[229]\r\n\r\nWomen can not serve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: Women may practice medicine, but are forbidden by statute\r\nto practice law.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The Legislature of 1889 established the State Normal and\r\nIndustrial College for Girls (white) at Athens, largely through the\r\nefforts of women. The Hon. W. Y. Atkinson, afterward Governor,\r\nchampioned the bill. No woman is eligible to serve as president of\r\nthis college. A board of Women Visitors was appointed by Governor\r\nAtkinson.\r\n\r\nConsiderable effort has been made by the Georgia Federation of Woman's\r\nClubs to have the doors of the State University opened to women. At\r\npresent they are permitted to enter certain departments of the branch\r\ncolleges in different parts of the State, but not to enter the\r\nUniversity itself upon any terms, being thus deprived of the highest\r\neducational facilities.\r\n\r\nThe State Normal School and the North Georgia Agricultural College\r\n(both white), the Georgia State Industrial College (colored) and the\r\nAtlanta University (white and colored) are co-educational.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 4,168 men and 4,811 women teachers. It\r\nis impossible to obtain the average monthly salaries, but those of\r\nwomen are estimated to be two-thirds of those paid to men.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[220] The History is indebted for the material for this chapter to\r\nMrs. Mary L. McLendon, of Atlanta, honorary president of the State\r\nWoman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[221] See Chap. XV.\r\n\r\n[222] The State association never should cease to be grateful to \"the\r\nHoward girls,\" (Augusta, Claudia and Mrs. Miriam Howard Du Bose), as\r\nthe national officers called them, who brought this grand object\r\nlesson to Georgia to give Southern women the advantages which they\r\nthemselves had enjoyed the previous year in Washington, D. C. They\r\nrefused all proffered aid and themselves paid the expenses, which\r\namounted to $600, declaring that it was only right for them to do so,\r\nsince they had consulted no one when they gave the invitation at\r\nWashington but had taken the full responsibility.\r\n\r\n[223] William C. Sibley, Will N. Harben, G. Gunby Jordan, Walter H.\r\nJohnson, J. Colton Lynes, Charles Hubner, Lucian Knight, editor of the\r\n_Constitution_, and Walter B. Hill, chancellor of the State\r\nUniversity, all have declared in favor of woman suffrage. Mrs. Julia\r\nI. Patten, editor of the _Saturday Review_, is a member of the Atlanta\r\nassociation and her paper is its official organ.\r\n\r\nAmong others who have stood by a cause which it requires courage to\r\nadvocate in this State are J. H. and Mrs. Addie D. Hale, W. T. Cheney,\r\nS. M. White and William Forsyth; Mesdames Harriet Winchell, A. H.\r\nAmes, Mary Brent Reid, Harry Dewar, Nettie C. Hall, Francis Bellamy,\r\nA. G. Helmer, Sara Strahan, M. T. Wynne, Sarah McDonald Sheridan,\r\nPatrick H. Moore, E. A. Latimer, E. A. Corrigan, Charles Behre and Dr.\r\nSchuman; Misses Mary Lamar Jackson, editor of the woman's department\r\nin the Atlanta _Journal_, E. Williams, Willette Allen and Sarah\r\nFreeman Clarke, sister of James Freeman Clarke, of Boston.\r\n\r\n[224] This certainly proved that woman suffrage had gained at least in\r\nrespectful consideration among politicians since February, 1895. At\r\nthat time Gov. W. Y. Atkinson refused the use of the same hall for the\r\ngreat National Association to hold a mass meeting on the last day of\r\nits visit to Atlanta. He declared it would be unconstitutional to\r\nallow women to use it, although white and negro men had been permitted\r\nto do so for many and varied purposes. The Hon. Charles A. Collier, a\r\ncounty commissioner, granted the basement of the courthouse for this\r\nmeeting, which was a marked success, though held underground. Speeches\r\nwere made by Miss Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Lyle Saxon, Mrs. Josephine K. Henry and others.\r\n\r\n[225] Officers elected: President, Mrs. Gertrude C. Thomas;\r\nvice-presidents, Mrs. S. L. Ober Allen, Miss Sarah A. Gresham;\r\ncorresponding secretary, Mrs. Alice Daniel; recording secretary, Mrs.\r\nClaudia Howard Maxwell; treasurer, Mrs. E. O. Archer; auditor, D. M.\r\nAllen. Mrs. McLendon, who had been in office since 1892, refused to\r\nserve longer and was made honorary president.\r\n\r\n[226] A bill presented by Thomas J. Chappelle in 1901 to make the\r\nUniversity co-educational was defeated in the Senate and not\r\nconsidered in the House. Virginia and Louisiana are the only other\r\nStates which exclude women, although North Carolina admits them only\r\nto its post-graduate department.\r\n\r\n[227] A bill providing for the teaching of the effects of alcoholic\r\ndrinks and other narcotics upon the system, requiring all teachers to\r\nstand an examination on this subject, and affixing a penalty for the\r\nfailure of any board of education to enforce the law, passed the\r\nLegislature of 1901--Senate, 23 ayes, 7 nays; House, 106 ayes, 28\r\nnays. It was signed by Gov. Allan C. Candler, December 17.\r\n\r\nThis law is now in effect in every State, Georgia being the last to\r\nadopt it.\r\n\r\n[228] The Atlanta South Side W. C. T. U. is the only one in the State\r\nto adopt the franchise department. Mrs. Isabella Webb Parks, one of\r\nthe editors of the _Union Signal_ and also a member of the city\r\nsuffrage association, is its superintendent of franchise.\r\n\r\n[229] In August, 1901, a police matron was at last appointed at a\r\nsalary of $30 per month. In December one of the police commissioners\r\nstated that she was invaluable and he did not see how they ever had\r\nmanaged to get on without a matron.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVI.\r\n\r\nIDAHO.[230]\r\n\r\n\r\nIdaho was admitted into the Union as a State in 1890. Previous to this\r\ntime there had been practically no work done for woman suffrage in the\r\nTerritory except that of Mrs. Abigail Scott Duniway of Oregon. Between\r\n1876 and 1895 she gave 140 public lectures, at the same time securing\r\nsubscribers to her paper, the _New Northwest_, devoted to the\r\ninterests of women, and distributing literature. She traveled 12,000\r\nmiles by river, rail, stage and buckboard and canvassed many a mile on\r\nfoot.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Mrs. Duniway addressed the Territorial Legislature in behalf\r\nof a bill to enfranchise women. In 1889 she appealed to the\r\nconstitutional convention at Boise to adopt a woman suffrage clause.\r\nJudge William H. Claggett, the president, and a majority of the\r\nmembers favored it, but yielded to the fears of the minority that it\r\nwould endanger the acceptance of the constitution by the voters.\r\n\r\nJudge Milton Kelly, founder and for many years editor of the Boise\r\n_Daily Statesman_, was one of the early advocates of the rights of\r\nwomen, as also was his wife, who was, indeed, the pioneer suffragist\r\nof Idaho. Mrs. Rebecca Mitchell, president of the State Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union, was another early laborer. At her request\r\nLouis E. Workman introduced a bill into the House of the Legislature\r\nof 1893, asking for a constitutional amendment conferring suffrage on\r\nwomen, and it was defeated by only two votes.\r\n\r\nIn a little country schoolhouse, May 16, 1893, at Hagerman, Lincoln\r\nCounty, the first suffrage society was formed. The teacher, Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Ingram, was president and prime mover, and its members were\r\nscattered over a territory of ten miles.\r\n\r\nUp to this time, there had not been any organized effort in the State\r\nto secure the ballot for women, although there was a pronounced\r\nsentiment in its favor. The real campaign began at the time of the\r\nassembling of the Republican State Convention in 1894. At a conference\r\nof a few friends of the measure a resolution was prepared for\r\npresentation, pledging the party to submit the question of equal\r\nsuffrage to a vote. The plank was introduced and championed by the\r\nHon. W. E. Borah. Mrs. J. Ellen Foster of Washington, D. C., addressed\r\nthe convention, and the Hon. Edgar Wilson urged the adoption of the\r\nresolution, which was done with little or no opposition.\r\n\r\nThe Populist State Convention passed a similar resolution, but it was\r\nnot adopted by the Democratic.\r\n\r\nAs a result of the election the Republicans were placed in\r\noverwhelming control of the Legislature, and the desired joint\r\nresolution submitting the question to a vote was passed unanimously in\r\nthe Senate on January 11, and by 33 yeas, 2 nays in the House on Jan.\r\n17, 1895.\r\n\r\nThe campaign for woman suffrage was spirited and effective. In the\r\nearly part of the year Mrs. Duniway came to Boise and held a meeting.\r\nA temporary organization was formed at that time, but for sufficient\r\nreasons nothing was done to start the work until some months later.\r\n\r\nIn the summer the National Association sent Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe of\r\nIllinois to assist in organizing the State. She lectured through June\r\nand July and formed many clubs, often making her own appointments and\r\novercoming the most discouraging obstacles.\r\n\r\nA State convention was held in Boise Nov. 20, 1895, at which officers\r\nwere elected as follows: President, Mrs. J. H. Richards;\r\nvice-president, Mrs. W. W. Woods; secretary, Mrs. Eunice Pond Athey;\r\ntreasurer, Mrs. Leah Burnside; advisory board, Mrs. Kate E. N.\r\nFeltham, Mrs. M. J. Whitman, Miss Annette Bowman. A telegram was\r\nreceived from Miss Susan B. Anthony, saying: \"Educate the rank and\r\nfile of voters through political party newspapers and meetings.\"\r\n\r\nTo the advisory board were added William Balderston,[231] D. L.\r\nBadley and James A. McGee. The last having been made chairman of the\r\nDemocratic State Central Committee was able to be of much assistance\r\nto the suffragists.\r\n\r\nMrs. Laura M. Johns of Kansas came into the State in May, 1896, in\r\ntime to attend a meeting of the advisory board at Nampa and to render\r\ninvaluable help. By order of the board a convention was called in\r\nBoise, July 1-3, at which Mrs. Johns was present. The officers elected\r\nwere: President, Mrs. Whitman; vice-presidents, Mrs. Feltham, Mrs.\r\nHelen Young, Idaho's only woman attorney, Mrs. D. L. Badley;\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Athey; treasurer, Mrs. I. Herron; press committee,\r\nMrs. Kate Green, Mrs. Young, Mrs. Minnie Priest Dunton. Thus\r\norganized, the association conducted the final campaign.\r\n\r\nThe president authorized the secretary to send a circular letter to\r\nall clubs urging them to commence in the precinct primaries the work\r\nof securing suffrage planks in the platforms of the several political\r\nparties. Wherever possible delegates were elected pledged to support\r\nthe amendment.\r\n\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the national organizing\r\ncommittee, came to Boise August 14. On the 18th and 25th she lectured\r\nto crowded houses there and captured her audiences. She addressed the\r\ncommittees on resolutions of the different party State conventions,\r\nand, with the aid of Mrs. Johns, Major and Mrs. W. W. Woods and other\r\neffective workers, secured a plank favoring the amendment in each of\r\nthe four platforms--Republican, Democratic, Populist and Silver\r\nRepublican. Her coming was opportune and her work most valuable. The\r\nindorsement by the Democratic convention was a great achievement, and\r\nthe fact that the planks had been inserted in all the political\r\nplatforms was a strong point later on in the case before the Supreme\r\nCourt.[232]\r\n\r\nAfter the conventions Mrs. Johns returned home, and Mrs. Chapman Catt\r\nwent to aid the California campaign, speaking several times in Idaho\r\n_en route_.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary C. C. Bradford of Colorado came in September. For six weeks\r\nshe traveled over sandhills, mountains, valleys and sage plains,\r\nvisiting points not reached by other workers. She organized fourteen\r\nnew clubs and made many converts. Mrs. Helen D. Harford of Oregon\r\nlectured at several places on her way to the St. Louis W. C. T. U.\r\nconvention. Many campaign speakers of all political parties called the\r\nattention of the voters to the amendment, and some gave a large\r\nportion of their time to the cause. This proved of great benefit,\r\nreaching voters who would not attend a suffrage meeting.\r\n\r\nHeadquarters were opened at Boise August 1. As three of the counties\r\nhad no organizations whatever, it was found necessary to reach the\r\nprecincts in these, as well as in some others, by correspondence; but\r\nby November 3 there were few without at least one active worker. Mrs.\r\nWhitman came to Boise October 1, and labored zealously until the\r\nelection. Previous to her coming Miss Frances Wood had ably assisted\r\nthe secretary at headquarters.\r\n\r\nThe press was carefully looked after during the last three months of\r\nthe campaign, and out of sixty-five papers only three were openly\r\nopposed. Seven thousand copies of the resolutions passed at the\r\nsuffrage convention in July were sent out; also literature presented\r\nby the Utah association, 100 copies of the _Woman's Tribune_ and 3,000\r\nleaflets from Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby, and 9,000 tracts purchased of\r\nthe National Association.[233]\r\n\r\nA strong factor in the campaign was the large colony in the Southern\r\npart of the State who were residents of Utah when women voted there\r\nand who believed in their enfranchisement. Mrs. Emily S. Richards of\r\nUtah did effective work among them.\r\n\r\nThe amendment was voted upon at the general election of November,\r\n1896. The association had had 50,000 dodgers printed, \"Vote for the\r\nwoman suffrage amendment.\" These were sent to every precinct in the\r\nState and given to voters on election day as a reminder. On that day\r\nthe local clubs did heroic work. It would be impossible to describe in\r\ndetail the final effort made by the women. Mrs. R. H. Leonard, Sr., of\r\nSilver City, and her co-workers stood all day, ankle-deep in snow,\r\ndistributing the slips and urging the voters to cast their ballots in\r\nfavor of the amendment. At many points refreshments were served as\r\nnear the polls as permissible under the law.\r\n\r\nWhen the results of the election were officially announced it was\r\nfound that there were 12,126 votes in favor of the amendment and 6,282\r\nagainst it--a majority of 5,844.\r\n\r\nA question arose, however, whether this was such a majority as is\r\ncontemplated by the constitution, the number of electors voting on the\r\namendment not being as great as the largest number voting on the\r\ncandidates. The constitution provides that \"if a majority of the\r\nelectors shall ratify the same, such amendment or amendments shall\r\nbecome a part of this constitution.\" It was held by the opponents that\r\nit would require a majority of all the electors to ratify it, and the\r\nmatter was taken at once to the Supreme Court. Attorneys J. H. Hawley,\r\nW. E. Borah and M. W. Tate gave their services gratuitously to\r\nprosecute the case. Judge J. H. Richards also rendered valuable\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nAfter a few weeks of anxious waiting, this tribunal, consisting of\r\nJudges Isaac N. Sullivan, Joseph W. Huston and John T. Morgan,\r\nrendered a unanimous decision that a _majority of those voting on the\r\nquestion_ was sufficient to carry it. And thus the women of Idaho were\r\nenfranchised!\r\n\r\nThe total expenses of this campaign were less than $2,500.\r\n\r\nThe city election of Boise, in July, 1897, was the first after the\r\nadoption of equal suffrage, and the woman vote was a most important\r\nfactor. The issue was that of public improvements. On this the\r\nmajority of women took sides in favor of progress, although the\r\n_personnel_ of the tickets was such that it was thought they would\r\ngenerally vote the other way; and to them belongs the credit of the\r\nvictory.\r\n\r\nThe first State election under equal suffrage was in 1898, and there\r\nwas very general participation by women. In all the counties their\r\nclubs did effective work and exercised a good influence. The election\r\nwas noticeable for its order and the absence of anything like the\r\nscenes at the polls so common in former times. About 40 per cent. of\r\nthe vote was cast by women. One of them, Mrs. B. T. Jeffers, rode\r\nsixty miles on horseback to her old home in order to vote.\r\n\r\nThree women were elected members of the Legislature, Mrs. Clara\r\nCampbell, Republican; Mrs. Hattie Noble, Democrat; Mrs. Mary Allen\r\nWright, Populist. Mrs. Wright was chairman of the House Committee of\r\nthe Whole during one entire afternoon, and ruled with a firm but\r\nimpartial hand.\r\n\r\nFour women were elected county treasurers, and these have given entire\r\nsatisfaction. One of them has been renominated by her party. Miss\r\nPermeal French was elected State superintendent of public instruction\r\nand re-elected in 1900.[234] Fifteen women were chosen county\r\nsuperintendents.\r\n\r\nIn nearly all the counties women are found holding responsible\r\nappointments. Three have been made deputy sheriffs. Since equal\r\nsuffrage was adopted women have been placed on the Board of Regents of\r\nthe State University for the first time.\r\n\r\nGov. Frank Steunenberg said in 1900:\r\n\r\n     In a general sense there can be no doubt that the participation\r\n     of women in our public affairs has had a most elevating\r\n     influence. All parties see the necessity of nominating the best\r\n     individuals. The natural aim of women is toward the highest good\r\n     of the community, and the best social conditions. Instead of\r\n     seeking extremes of reform, as had been predicted, they are\r\n     interested in stable and conservative administration, for the\r\n     benefit of the homes and the children, and they avoid radical and\r\n     excessive reforms. In short, the objections which in theory have\r\n     been urged against woman's participation in public affairs have\r\n     been overcome by the actual application of the system in Idaho.\r\n\r\n     The suggestion may be made that this activity of women in public\r\n     affairs has operated to draw them away from their homes and from\r\n     the usual domestic avocations, a suggestion which our experience\r\n     amply disproves. In Idaho women are to-day the same loving wives,\r\n     kind mothers and capable home-managers that they always have\r\n     been. Nor has there been the least belittling of the sex in the\r\n     eyes of the men, nor any falling off in that tenderness and\r\n     respect which men universally accord to women. There is not the\r\n     slightest interruption of family ties. Whether husband and wife\r\n     vote together or oppositely excites no interest and no animosity,\r\n     although naturally families are apt to have the same party\r\n     affiliations. The system has not operated to take women from\r\n     their homes, nor has it tended to make them in any way\r\n     masculine.[235]\r\n\r\nIn the presidential election of 1900 women showed the liveliest\r\ninterest. The universal testimony was that never in the history of the\r\nState had there been such order about the polling-places. Four-fifths\r\nof the ballots were cast by 1 o'clock. The women did as effective work\r\nas the men in getting out the voters.\r\n\r\nThe total population of Idaho is 161,762, and is composed, in round\r\nnumbers, of 58 per cent. of males and 42 per cent. of females. The\r\ntotal vote of the men was 55,096; of the women, 19,660. In the\r\ncounties representing the agricultural, manufacturing and general\r\nbusiness of the State the women's vote averaged 41 per cent. of the\r\ntotal ballot. In the counties devoted exclusively to mining, where\r\nthere are very few women, they cast only 24 per cent. This brought the\r\naverage of the women's vote in the entire State down to 35-1/2 per\r\ncent. of the total.\r\n\r\nIn Boise 1,982 men and 1,561 women registered; total, 3,543. The vote\r\ncast was 3,281. Allowing for the usual failures on the part of the\r\nmen, these figures show that over 40 per cent. of the vote of this\r\ncity must have been cast by women.[236]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: The placing of the ballot in the hands of\r\nwomen has had the effect of bringing about two changes of the highest\r\nimportance. The session of the Legislature held immediately after the\r\nadoption of the suffrage amendment passed an act prohibiting gambling.\r\nPrior to that time it had been licensed in the State, and its\r\nestablishments were openly conducted in practically all communities.\r\nAgainst this evil the sentiment of the women was solidly arrayed, and\r\nit could not be ignored. Before they voted, a bill altering the law\r\nwould have been ignominiously pigeon-holed, but the ballot in their\r\nhands wrought a change under which a measure abolishing gambling was\r\nenacted. This was found defective, and gambling continued until the\r\nnext legislative session. The gambling interests organized a lobby to\r\nprevent the enactment of a valid law against their business, but they\r\nfailed, the law was passed, and gambling has since been suppressed in\r\nnearly all communities. The sentiment which obtained the law secures\r\nits enforcement--men do not dare run counter to the wishes of women,\r\nwhen the latter have in their hands the power to make or unmake\r\npoliticians.\r\n\r\nThe present session of the Legislature (1900) passed a bill exempting\r\nwomen from jury service. Gov. Frank W. Hunt returned it with his veto,\r\nin which he said that this was in response to the protests of the\r\nwomen themselves, who objected to being deprived of this right. There\r\nwas some talk in the Legislature of passing it over his veto, but this\r\nwas finally abandoned. The women took the ground that while the\r\nostensible object was to relieve them of an onerous duty, the real one\r\nwas to protect the gamblers and other law-breakers to whom women\r\njurors show no favor.\r\n\r\nIt is to be regretted that Governor Hunt could not have been\r\ninfluenced by the protests of women on another point. The law of Idaho\r\nprovides that while a wife may hold property in her own name, the\r\nhusband shall have control of it. The present Legislature passed an\r\nact giving married women control of their separate property. This was\r\nvetoed by the Governor, who said:\r\n\r\n     Our statutes as they now exist provide complete adjustment of the\r\n     property relations between man and wife, placing them upon equal\r\n     terms, excepting that the husband has the management and control\r\n     of his wife's property during marriage, unless it should be taken\r\n     from him on complaint of the wife for causes set forth in Sec.\r\n     2,499.\r\n\r\nAs the law stands the wife can secure control over her own property\r\nonly by going into court, showing that her husband is mismanaging it,\r\nand obtaining a decree taking it away from him.\r\n\r\nThe law regarding the inheritance of the separate estates is the same\r\nfor husband and wife, but not so of the community. Upon the death of\r\nthe wife the entire community property belongs to the husband without\r\nadministration. Upon the death of the husband one-half the community\r\nproperty belongs to the wife; the other half is subject to his\r\ntestamentary disposition, or in the absence of that goes to his\r\ndescendants in equal shares. If he leave neither will nor descendants,\r\nit goes to the wife.\r\n\r\nThe earnings of the wife belong to the husband unless she is living\r\nseparate from him.\r\n\r\nNo provision is made compelling the husband to support the wife, but\r\nif he is infirm she must support him.\r\n\r\nIf the wife desire to engage in business she must apply to the court\r\nfor permission, showing the necessity for it; and every time she\r\nwishes to remove to another place she must repeat this process.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the children. At his death the\r\nmother, if suitable, is guardian while she remains unmarried.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 14 years in\r\n1893, and from 14 to 18 in 1895. The penalty is imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary for not less than five years, and this may be extended\r\nfor life.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women have complete suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women are eligible to all offices. (See previous\r\npages.)\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: Naturally none are forbidden to women.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The State University and all other educational institutions\r\nare open to both sexes.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 344 men and 558 women teachers. The\r\naverage monthly salary of the men is $56.11; of the women, $44.83.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[230] The History is indebted for this chapter to William Balderston,\r\neditor of the Boise _Daily Statesman_, and Mrs. Eunice Pond Athey,\r\nsecretary of the State Suffrage Association during the amendment\r\ncampaign of 1896, when women became enfranchised.\r\n\r\n[231] It was through the influence of Mr. Balderston more than that of\r\nany other one man that the suffrage amendment was passed by the\r\nLegislature. His power politically was felt during all the campaign.\r\nIt was only his personal influence which secured for the measure the\r\nhelp of the _Daily Statesman_ of Boise, which it was so necessary to\r\nhave. Through his persuasion the co-operation of the National Woman\r\nSuffrage Association was invited. He was our principal adviser\r\nthroughout, and with money, voice and pen aided the cause in every\r\npossible way. [Eunice Pond Athey.\r\n\r\n[232] Republican: We favor the amendments to the constitution of this\r\nState proposed by the late Republican Legislature, including equal\r\nsuffrage for men and women, and recommend their adoption.\r\n\r\nSilver Republican: We favor the adoption of the proposed amendment to\r\nthe constitution of the State providing for the extension of the right\r\nof suffrage to women.\r\n\r\nPeople's Party: Believing in equal rights to all and special\r\nprivileges to none, we favor the adoption of the pending woman's\r\nsuffrage amendment to the constitution.\r\n\r\nDemocratic: We recommend to the favorable consideration of the voters\r\nof the State the proposed constitutional amendment granting equal\r\nsuffrage, believing that the great question should receive the earnest\r\nattention of every person as an important factor in the future welfare\r\nof the State.\r\n\r\n[233] Among those who aided this movement were Judge J. H. Richards,\r\nthe Hon. Fremont Wood, Ex-Secretary of State George J. Lewis, Judge C.\r\nO. Stockslager, J. H. Hawley, U. S. Marshal Joseph Pinkham, Judge J.\r\nH. Beatty, the Hon. J. A. McGee, the Hon. Joseph Perrault, the Hon.\r\nEdgar Wilson, and their wives; also the wives of the Justices of the\r\nSupreme Court; Mesdames Martha B. Keller, M. A. Wright and Mina J.\r\nMathew, and Miss Annette Bowman of the faculty of the State\r\nUniversity.\r\n\r\n[234] Gov. Frank Steunenberg thus testified: \"It is conceded by all\r\nthat Miss French is the best officer in that capacity the State ever\r\nhas had. The place she occupies is one of unusual importance with\r\nus.... Of the three women in the Legislature it may also be said that\r\nthey made most acceptable public officers, serving with ability and\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\n[235] See Appendix--Testimony from Woman Suffrage States.\r\n\r\n[236] Prof. L. F. Henderson of the State University says that equal\r\nsuffrage, even in the few years it has been in operation in Idaho, has\r\nproved itself a thing so simple, so natural, so entirely free from any\r\nobjectionable features, that it is now generally accepted and looked\r\nupon as a matter of course. It has already converted the majority of\r\nthe men who were opposed and, which is still more remarkable, has\r\nconverted also the majority of the women.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henderson says the intelligent women take more interest in\r\nsuffrage than the ignorant ones; that women have suffered no loss of\r\nconsideration or social influence, but are treated, if anything, with\r\nmore respect. The possession of the ballot has made them much more\r\nintelligent about public questions, as it has stimulated the study of\r\nthese.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVII.\r\n\r\nILLINOIS.[237]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Equal Suffrage Association has had only four presidents\r\nin the past sixteen years. Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton Harbert retired from\r\nthis office at the annual meeting of Sept. 25, 1884, and was succeeded\r\nby Mrs. Mary E. Holmes, who served until the autumn of 1889, when Mrs.\r\nHarbert again filled the presidency for one year. At the convention of\r\n1890 Mrs. Holmes was re-elected, and held office until her resignation\r\nin 1897. In May of this year, Mrs. Julia Mills Dunn was elected. In\r\n1899 Mrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch was made president, and in 1900\r\nMrs. Harbert resumed the position for one year. The other officers\r\nelected were: Vice-president, Dr. Julia Holmes Smith; corresponding\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Mary Munn; recording secretary, Miss S. Grace\r\nNicholas; treasurer, the Rev. Kate Hughes; chairman executive\r\ncommittee, Mrs. Elmina E. Springer.\r\n\r\nAs the work is divided into districts and counties, and as there are\r\ntwenty-two districts and 102 counties partially organized, it will not\r\nbe possible to name in this chapter the hundreds of quiet but very\r\nefficient workers, men and women, or to tell of their unselfish\r\ndevotion, shown often in the face of fierce opposition.\r\n\r\nThe association has held a State convention each year, except 1893,\r\nthe year of the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, when it was decided\r\ninstead to attend the World's Congress of Representative Women, which\r\nmet in May.[238] At many of these meetings national officers were\r\npresent, among them Susan B. Anthony and Lucy Stone, and the halls\r\nwere seldom large enough to accommodate the crowds in attendance.\r\nThere have been also district and county conventions every year, while\r\nFourth of July celebrations, county fairs and Chautauqua assemblies\r\nhave been utilized to disseminate suffrage sentiment.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 Senator Miles B. Castle, Judge C. B. Waite, Mrs. Dunn and Mrs.\r\nHelen M. Gougar, the last-named from Indiana, held suffrage\r\nconferences in various cities. Later in this and the following year,\r\nsimilar meetings were held in a number of other places by the Illinois\r\nworkers, with the assistance of Mrs. Gougar and the Rev. Anna Howard\r\nShaw.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 occurred a series of conventions which extended over six weeks\r\nand was conducted by Mrs. Zerelda G. Wallace of Indiana and Mrs.\r\nMcCulloch. In November Mrs. Holmes made a two-weeks' lecturing trip.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 and '93 Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe canvassed the State, speaking in\r\nnearly fifty towns and cities, and raising enough money to defray all\r\nexpenses and put a handsome amount in the treasury for legislative\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1893, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the national\r\norganization committee, made a lecture tour of the central and\r\nsouthern part of Illinois.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the National Association held a series of meetings in Illinois\r\nwith Miss Mary G. Hay of New York, Mrs. Jennie Hutchins, Mrs. Leonora\r\nBeck, as managers, and Mrs. Dunn and the Rev. Ida C. Hultin as\r\nspeakers. During the summer Mrs. Dunn, with Mrs. Martha A. B. Conine\r\nof Colorado lectured in numerous cities; and in November the national\r\nofficers held a conference in Chicago, in which Miss Anthony and Miss\r\nShaw, president and vice-president of the National Association, Mrs.\r\nChapman Catt and also many local workers participated.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Miss Lena Morrow made speeches for the State association and\r\nspent a month lecturing before labor organizations. She secured\r\nsuffrage resolutions from unions representing a membership of 25,000.\r\n\r\nMrs. McCulloch gave the month of June, 1890, to canvassing South\r\nDakota in the interest of the suffrage amendment there; and in the\r\nfall of 1898 Mrs. Dunn and Miss Morrow were sent to that State to\r\nassist in its second campaign for one month, at the expense of the\r\nIllinois association. Miss Morrow worked also in the amendment\r\ncampaign of 1900 in Oregon for two-and-one-half months, a portion of\r\nher expenses being contributed by Illinois suffragists.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Political Equality League was organized by Miss Ellen A.\r\nMartin, who was at its head for many years.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In 1891, at the request of the State E.\r\nS. A., a joint resolution was presented to the Legislature for an\r\namendment to the constitution enfranchising women. This was championed\r\nin the House by George W. Curtis and brought to a vote. It received 54\r\nvotes, a majority of those cast but not a constitutional majority,\r\nwhich is one over one-half of the whole membership. Charles Bogardus\r\nmanaged the bill in the Senate, but was not able to secure a vote upon\r\nit. The hard work for this Amendment Bill, however, paved the way for\r\nthe passage of the School Suffrage Bill later in the session.\r\n\r\nThis bill had been prepared by the State Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion, and was introduced into the Senate by T. C. MacMillan. Although\r\nthere were many more petitions asking for the amendment than for\r\nSchool Suffrage, their combined influence, with Senator MacMillan's\r\nearnest work, was sufficient to pass this bill through the Senate by\r\n29 ayes, 4 noes. At the closing hour of the last session in the House,\r\nDr. H. M. Moore, one of the members of a third party that finally had\r\nassisted the Democrats to elect John M. Palmer as United States\r\nSenator, made an urgent plea that something should be done for the\r\nwomen; and because of his eloquence, or the gratitude of the\r\nDemocrats, or the keen sense of justice among all the members, the\r\nSenate School Suffrage Bill was passed by 83 ayes, 43 noes.\r\n\r\nAs it was the general impression that women had received the full\r\nSchool Franchise by this bill, they proceeded to vote on bonds,\r\nlocation of buildings and various other matters pertaining to the\r\nschools, and also for county superintendents. The bill was obscurely\r\nworded, and it has taken four decisions of the Supreme Court of\r\nIllinois to decide just the points which it covered and the limits to\r\nwhich it might be constitutionally extended. As it now stands, under\r\nthis law women can vote only for candidates for such school offices\r\nas have been created by the Legislature. (See Suffrage.)\r\n\r\nHowever, this bill was useful in securing from the Supreme Court the\r\nruling that the Legislature had power to regulate the suffrage\r\nconcerning all positions created by itself. Heretofore the weight of\r\njudicial opinion had been the other way; that no change whatever could\r\nbe made in the suffrage except by constitutional amendment.[239]\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1893 R. W. Coon secured the passage in the\r\nSenate of a Township Suffrage Bill prepared by the State association.\r\nIts members argued that if school offices not named in the\r\nconstitution are creations of the Legislature, so are most of the\r\ntownship offices and therefore it has power to grant women the\r\nsuffrage for these. This bill was accompanied by a petition of 12,000\r\nnames. Senator Bogardus made a spirited report on these, extolling the\r\ncharacter of the signers, whose standing he had ascertained from the\r\nsenators of their districts. It passed the Senate by 26 votes, a\r\nconstitutional majority. In the House the committee reported it\r\nfavorably, many members pledged themselves to its support, and it went\r\nthrough the second reading safely; but just when expectation ran\r\nhighest, it was referred back to the committee and smothered.\r\n\r\nIn this same Legislature a bill to repeal the School Suffrage Law was\r\ndefeated in the House, less than 40 of the 153 members voting aye. It\r\nwas not brought to a vote in the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Senator Coon introduced the Township Bill again, but owing to\r\nabsentees it received only 23 votes, 26 being necessary to pass it.\r\nFearing that a majority of the members of the House were pledged to\r\nvote for it, the chairman of the committee to which it was referred\r\nmade a sub-committee of three notorious opponents who took care that\r\nit never was reported.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Senator G. W. Monroe took charge of the State association's\r\nmeasures. Bills for Township and Bond Suffrage, and for suffrage for\r\ncertain city, county and township officers and for Presidential\r\nelectors, were introduced by him but failed to pass.\r\n\r\nIn the special session of 1898 only such matters could be considered\r\nas were named by Gov. John R. Tanner in calling it. The State\r\nassociation petitioned him to include woman suffrage in the list, but\r\nhe did not grant the request. One of the subjects named was taxation.\r\nThe association prepared a bill to exempt the property of women from\r\ntaxation until they were allowed to vote. All the metropolitan papers\r\nwere interested in or amused by this bill, and gave it considerable\r\npublicity, but it was not acted upon.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the three bills championed by Senator Monroe in 1897 were\r\nmanaged by Senator Isaac H. Hamilton. He forced two of them to a vote,\r\nbut neither received a majority.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time Mrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch, a practicing\r\nlawyer of Chicago, auditor of the National Association and former\r\npresident of the State E. S. A., was the very efficient legislative\r\nsuperintendent. She pressed the bills with a force which almost\r\nbrought success by its own momentum, and yet by her good judgment and\r\nfair methods kept the respect of legislators who were bitterly opposed\r\nto her measures.[240]\r\n\r\nSometimes the hearings on these bills occurred in the Senate Chamber\r\nor the House of Representatives. One of the most noteworthy was in\r\n1895, when about twenty women, representing many different localities,\r\nsocieties and nationalities, made clever five-minute speeches.\r\n\r\nThe State association has sent the _Woman's Journal_, the _Woman's\r\nColumn_ and other suffrage literature to members of the Legislature\r\nfor months at a time. Petitions always have accompanied the bills.\r\nAdded to those presented in 1899 were resolutions adopted by various\r\nChicago labor organizations of men, representing a membership of\r\n25,000. The petitions of the State association generally have exceeded\r\nall those presented for all other measures.[241]\r\n\r\nThere has been no distinction between husband and wife in the laws of\r\ninheritance since 1873. The surviving wife or husband is endowed of a\r\nthird part of all the real estate of which the other dies possessed.\r\nIf either die without a will, leaving a surviving child or children,\r\nor descendants of such, the survivor receives, in addition, one-third\r\nof the personal estate absolutely. If, however, there are no lineal\r\ndescendants, the widow or widower receives absolutely one-half of the\r\nreal estate and the whole of the personal estate. If there are no\r\ndescendants and no kindred, the whole estate goes to the surviving\r\nwidow or widower.\r\n\r\nA married woman has held her property in her own name since 1861. She\r\nhas been entitled to engage in business, control her earnings, sue and\r\nbe sued and make contracts since 1869.\r\n\r\nUntil 1901 the father was entitled to the care of the persons and\r\neducation of the minor children. In 1898 Mrs. McCulloch published, in\r\nthe form of a story called Mr. Lex, a _résumé_ of the terrible\r\ninjustice and cruelty possible under this law; and also pointed out\r\nthe same possibilities in the administration of other laws which seem\r\nentirely fair to the casual observer. It was widely reviewed by the\r\nChicago press and aroused much interest. In the winter of 1901 a bill\r\nwas passed by the Legislature giving fathers and mothers equal\r\nguardianship and custody of their minor children. Mrs. McCulloch,\r\nrepresenting the State E. S. A., had charge of this bill. A copy of\r\nher book, Mr. Lex, was sent to every member, as well as the full facts\r\nfrom every State which had such a law as the one proposed. She also\r\nobtained the indorsement of numerous organizations and influential\r\npersons, and had many individual letters written to members. All this\r\nsimply to give mothers equal guardianship with fathers of their own\r\nchildren!\r\n\r\nMrs. McCulloch was ably assisted by the Rev. Kate Hughes. The bill\r\npassed by the large vote of 34 ayes, 8 noes, in the Senate; 119 ayes,\r\none no, in the House. It was signed by Gov. Richard Yates on May 18.\r\n\r\nThe wife is entitled to support suited to her condition in life. The\r\nhusband is entitled to the same support out of her individual\r\nproperty. They are jointly liable for family expenses. Failure to\r\nsupport the wife and children under twelve years of age is a\r\nmisdemeanor, and may be punished by a fine of not less than $100 or\r\nmore than $500, or imprisonment in the county jail, house of\r\ncorrection or workhouse not less than one month nor more than twelve\r\nmonths, or both such fine and imprisonment. The wife may sue for\r\nseparate maintenance without divorce.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 14 years in\r\n1887, but it never has been possible to have this age extended. The\r\npenalty is imprisonment in the penitentiary for from one year to life.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 Mrs. Florence Kelley and Miss Mary Kenney, aided by the\r\nwomen's and men's labor organizations of Chicago and by many women's\r\nclubs, secured a Factory Inspection Law. It contained a prohibition\r\nagainst the employment of a woman over eight hours daily in any\r\nfactory or workshop, but this section was declared unconstitutional\r\nbecause it was a restriction upon the right to contract.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: The Legislature which adjourned in 1891 left the School\r\nSuffrage Law obscure, incomplete and with no provisions to carry out\r\nits intentions. In many cases the women had to provide their own\r\nballots and ballot-boxes. To the credit of the large majority of the\r\njudges of election it can be said that they accepted the votes of the\r\nwomen with no certainty that they were acting legally or would be\r\nsustained by future decisions. In a number of instances, however, in\r\nthe more ignorant parts of the State, the votes were insolently\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nIn the country and unincorporated towns, in villages and small cities,\r\nwhere the school boards are elected by the people, there are a number\r\nof officers for whom women may vote;[242] but in places like Chicago,\r\nwhere the board is appointed by the mayor, the only vote they have is\r\nfor three trustees of the State University every two years.\r\n\r\nIn the summer and fall of 1893 the officers of the State association\r\nagitated the question of asking for the nomination of a woman as one\r\nof these trustees, and in March, 1894, the convention in Danville\r\napproved this suggestion. The auxiliary societies were urged to use\r\nall their influence to have delegates from their counties to the State\r\npolitical conventions instructed to vote for a woman candidate. Later\r\nin the spring several of the suffrage officers and prominent women of\r\nChicago appeared before the Republican State Central Committee, and\r\nthe same day visited the Republican State Editorial Association,\r\nasking their influence to secure the nomination of a woman for\r\ntrustee. Letters were sent to 200 leading politicians of different\r\nparties giving reasons why such action should be taken and asking for\r\ntheir co-operation. Personal appeals were made to the editors of the\r\nChicago dailies for their influence.\r\n\r\nThen came the most important work of all--securing the indorsement of\r\nthe Cook County conventions. Previous to that of the Republicans Mrs.\r\nMcCulloch interviewed leading members of the county committee and\r\nreceived an invitation to present the matter to the convention, which\r\nshe did, representing both the State E. S. A. and the Woman's Club of\r\nChicago. Mrs. Elmina D. Springer also made an address. They were\r\ninvited to meet the resolutions committee, were treated with great\r\ncourtesy, and the resolution asking that delegates to the State\r\nconvention be instructed to vote as a unit for the nomination of a\r\nwoman for University trustee, was adopted.\r\n\r\nThe Chicago Woman's Club sent fifty women to the Cook County\r\nDemocratic Convention and secured the same pledge.\r\n\r\nCommittees were then appointed to manage this question in the State\r\nconventions of the parties. Just a few days before the first\r\n(Democratic), the attorney-general, who was a Democrat, gave the\r\nopinion that women could not legally vote for trustees or be trustees,\r\nand published it widely in the Chicago press. Mrs. McCulloch followed\r\nhim with a carefully prepared brief which also was given to the press.\r\nThis new difficulty made it imperative for her to attend the\r\nDemocratic State Convention to present her view of the disputed legal\r\npoint, and this she did with marked success. Whenever any of the\r\ndelegates said, \"Why, haven't you read Maloney's opinion that a woman\r\ncan not hold the office or vote for trustee?\" she would answer, \"Yes,\r\nbut haven't you read my opinion that she can?\" She addressed the\r\nentire convention, and the nomination of Dr. Julia Holmes Smith was\r\nmade unanimously. The other political parties then had to follow with\r\nthe nomination of a woman or fall behind the Democrats in chivalry.\r\n\r\nAs the Chicago Woman's Club sent a strong representation to the\r\nRepublican convention, and as pledges already had been secured from\r\nthe delegates, the committee appointed by the suffrage association did\r\nnot deem it necessary to attend. Mrs. Lucy L. Flower was nominated by\r\nthis body.\r\n\r\nThe Prohibitionists nominated two women, one of them the secretary of\r\nthe Illinois E. S. A., Prof. Rena Michaels Atchison.\r\n\r\nThis recognition from the different parties so encouraged the women\r\nthat in 1894 they voted enthusiastically throughout the State,\r\nespecially in Chicago where the candidates were well known. Before the\r\nelection, however, a difficulty arose from an unexpected quarter. The\r\nmen composing the Board of University Trustees became alarmed, and\r\nemployed an attorney who gave an opinion that women neither could vote\r\nfor trustees nor be elected to the office. He rushed into print; Mrs.\r\nMcCulloch, who might have been worn to shreds by this time, patiently\r\nanswered the young man, and \"the women went right on voting.\"\r\n\r\nProfessor Atchison had the compliment of receiving about 3,000 votes\r\nmore than the men on the same ticket as herself, and Dr. Smith\r\nlikewise ran ahead of her ticket.[243] Mrs. Flower was the successful\r\ncandidate, also leading the nominees of her party.\r\n\r\nThe Republican women organized by appointing a State Central\r\nCommittee, and placed upon it a woman from each congressional\r\ndistrict.[244] The Democratic women formed a Cornelia Club which\r\nworked for the interest of their party's nominee.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: A statute of Illinois (1873) provides that no person\r\nshall be debarred from any occupation, profession or employment\r\n(except the military), on account of sex, and that this shall not be\r\nconstrued to affect the eligibility of any person to an elective\r\noffice.[245]\r\n\r\nThe following have served as trustees of the State University: Mrs.\r\nLucy L. Flower, Dr. Julia Holmes Smith, Mrs. Mary Turner Carriel, Mrs.\r\nAlice Asbury Abbott, Mrs. Carrie Thomas Alexander. The term of office\r\nis six years.\r\n\r\nWomen are eligible to all school offices (1873) and large numbers have\r\nserved as county superintendents, members of city boards of education\r\nand directors of district schools. All the principal cities now have\r\nwomen on their school boards. In Chicago there are two at the present\r\ntime. Ten counties have women for superintendents.\r\n\r\nMiss Cora B. Hirtzell was appointed as assistant by C. S. Thornton,\r\ncorporation counsel of Chicago, and served during his whole term of\r\noffice.\r\n\r\nMiss Mary M. Bartelme was appointed by Gov. John R. Tanner Public\r\nGuardian of Cook County, and is the only woman in the United States to\r\nfill such a position. Her duties are to look after the persons of\r\nminors and their small estates, when no one else will take the\r\nguardianship, and she has over 200 children under her care. She\r\nreceived the highest commendation from Judge Christian C. Kohlsaat,\r\nformerly of the Probate Court, and continues to hold office under his\r\nsuccessor.\r\n\r\nA decision of the Supreme Court permits a woman to be Master in\r\nChancery, but only one ever was appointed.\r\n\r\nWomen may be official court reporters, but only two have been\r\nappointed. The office of a Judge being elective he naturally feels\r\nobliged to give these places to voters.\r\n\r\nWomen have been notaries public for over twenty years.\r\n\r\nMiss Kate O'Connor was deputy clerk of Winnebago County for ten years,\r\nand Miss Rose Beatson was deputy county treasurer. Mrs. A. T. Ames was\r\ndeputy sheriff of Boone County.\r\n\r\nFrequently the position of State Librarian has been filled by a woman,\r\nand of late years that of postmaster in the House and the Senate. The\r\nlibrarian of the Southern Normal University at Carbondale is a woman.\r\nWomen have served as presidents of library boards in various places.\r\n\r\nWomen sit on the Board of Directors of the Illinois Farmers'\r\nInstitute. One of the State Commissioners of Public Charities was a\r\nwoman; but she resigned because of the introduction of politics into\r\nthe board. A woman has served on the State Board of Health.\r\n\r\nThe Home for Juvenile Female Offenders was established in 1893. It is\r\nunder the control of five trustees, two of whom are women. The\r\nsuperintendent also is a woman.\r\n\r\nThe Soldiers' Widows' Home was established by a law of 1895, which\r\nprovided that of the five trustees three should be women and members\r\nof the State Woman's Relief Corps. The entire board is now composed of\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nChicago has three women deputy factory inspectors, and formerly had a\r\nchief inspector, Mrs. Florence Kelley, who served four years with\r\ngreat ability.\r\n\r\nMiss Jane Addams of Hull House was appointed garbage inspector of the\r\nnineteenth ward of Chicago by Mayor George B. Swift. She served one\r\nyear and was succeeded by Miss Amanda Johnson, also a resident of Hull\r\nHouse. Under their care this ward, which had been one of the most\r\nneglected in the city, became famous for cleanliness and order.\r\n\r\nVolunteer associations of women in Chicago did so much in this\r\ndirection that some of their members finally took the civil service\r\nexaminations for garbage inspectors or contractors and several\r\nreceived official positions. Among the most prominent of these is Mrs.\r\nA. Emmagene Paul, who superintends a large force of men in the first\r\nward of Chicago. As this is a down-town ward it is one of the hardest\r\nin the city to keep clean, but she performs the work to the\r\nsatisfaction of all except \"gang\" politicians, who have made every\r\npossible effort to have Mayor Carter Harrison remove her.\r\n\r\nMrs. Bertha Honore Palmer of Chicago was appointed United States\r\nCommissioner at the Paris Exposition of 1900 by President McKinley,\r\nthe only woman distinguished by any government with so important a\r\nposition. Miss Addams was appointed a member of the Jury of\r\nInternational Awards, Department of Social Economics, for the same\r\nexposition. Her election as vice-president of this jury made her\r\neligible to membership in the Group Jury, on which she also served.\r\nThis was a distinction conferred upon no other woman.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: All occupations were opened to women by a statute of\r\n1873, which declared also that they should not be required to work on\r\nstreets or roads or serve upon juries.\r\n\r\nThey were not allowed to practice law until 1872, Mrs. Myra W.\r\nBradwell having been the first to make application in 1869.[246] Since\r\nthat time ninety women have been admitted to the bar. Among those who\r\nhave done noteworthy work is the daughter of Judge and Mrs. Bradwell,\r\nMrs. Bessie Bradwell Helmer, who was chief editor of twenty volumes of\r\nthe Appellate Court Reports and, since the death of her mother, has\r\nbeen president of the _Chicago Legal News_ Company, which issues the\r\nprincipal law publications of the State.\r\n\r\nMrs. Catharine V. Waite published the _Chicago Law Times_ for two\r\nyears; Mrs. Marietta B. R. Shay wrote The Student's Guide to Common\r\nLaw Pleading; and Miss Ellen A. Martin organized the National Woman\r\nLawyer's League, and is its secretary. Women are members of the State\r\nand the Chicago Bar Associations and of the Chicago Law Institute.\r\n\r\nThe World's Columbian Exposition, held in Chicago in 1893, opened\r\nlarge fields of usefulness and power to women. Those of Illinois were\r\nespecially conspicuous in the wonderful work done by their sex during\r\nthis World's Fair. Its Board of Lady Managers was appointed under an\r\nAct of Congress to represent the special interests of women at the\r\nexposition, and Mrs. Bertha Honore Palmer was elected president. Mrs.\r\nEllen M. Henrotin of Chicago was vice-president and active\r\nsuperintendent of the Woman's Branch of the World's Congress\r\nAuxiliary.\r\n\r\nA complete official report of nearly 1,000 pages of the Congress of\r\nRepresentative Women, the greatest assemblage of women which ever had\r\nbeen held up to this date, was prepared by the Chairman of the\r\nOrganization Committee, Mrs. May Wright Sewall of Indianapolis, who\r\nmade several trips abroad in the interest of the Congress. To her\r\ngreat executive capacity and untiring efforts for three years, with\r\nthose added of its secretary, Mrs. Rachel Foster Avery of\r\nPhiladelphia, and the splendid co-operation of the committee of\r\nChicago women--Miss Frances E. Willard. Dr. Sarah Hackett Stevenson,\r\nDr. Julia Holmes Smith, Mrs. Lydia Avery Coonley, Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nBoynton Harbert and Mrs. William Thayer Brown--is due the fact that\r\nthis Congress was the most conspicuous success of any held during the\r\nExposition, with the exception of the Parliament of Religions. It\r\nconvened May 15, 1893, and continued one week, during which eighty-one\r\nmeetings were held in the different rooms of the Art Palace.\r\nTwenty-seven countries and 126 organizations were represented by 528\r\ndelegates. According to official estimate the total attendance\r\nexceeded 150,000.[247]\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The law colleges never have been closed to women. Union\r\nCollege of Law was the first in the United States to graduate a woman,\r\nMrs. Ada H. Kepley, in 1870.\r\n\r\nSome of the medical schools are still bitterly opposed to admitting\r\nwomen. All the homeopathic colleges are open to them with the\r\nexception of the Chicago Homeopathic. At Harvey Medical College about\r\nhalf the students are women, and several of the full professorships\r\nare filled by them. Hahnemann College admits them but has no woman\r\nprofessor or instructor. In 1899 Dr. Julia Holmes Smith was elected\r\ndean of the National Medical College (Homeopathic) with no dissenting\r\nvote, and in 1900 she was re-elected. She is the only woman dean of a\r\nmedical institution composed of both sexes. Women are received in the\r\nCollege of Physicians and Surgeons, which is the medical department of\r\nthe State University. Rush College, one of the largest of the\r\nallopathic institutions, has just been opened to them. All of the\r\ncolleges named above are in Chicago. Dr. Sarah Hackett Stevenson was\r\nthe first woman admitted to the American Medical Association.\r\n\r\nThe theological schools generally are closed to women. They are\r\nadmitted to the full courses of the Garrett Biblical Institute of the\r\nNorthwestern University. Lombard University gives them the full\r\nprivileges of its Divinity School (Universalist). In 1898 the Chicago\r\nUnion Theological Seminary (Congregationalist) opened its doors to\r\nthem. They may also enter the theological department of Chicago\r\nUniversity, but its circular of information says: \"Women students\r\nreceive no encouragement to become ministers.\"\r\n\r\nThe State University and all of the other large universities and\r\ncolleges in Illinois are open to women, although some of the minor\r\ninstitutions are still closed.\r\n\r\nThere are in the public schools 6,973 men and 18,974 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $60.42; of the women, $53.27.\r\nIn the Chicago schools women receive the same pay as men for the same\r\nwork, but the highly salaried positions are largely monopolized by\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nAn incident which has no parallel deserves a place on these pages. In\r\nChicago it was long the custom, whenever retrenchment of taxes became\r\nnecessary, to cut down the salaries of the school teachers. In 1899\r\nthey could not get even what was legally due to them, and in 1900 the\r\nsame condition prevailed.\r\n\r\nVarious reasons were given for the shortage of funds, but two of the\r\nteachers. Miss Margaret Haley and Miss Catharine Goggin, obtained\r\ninformation that the reason of the deficit was that some of the\r\nlargest corporations in the State were not assessed for taxes. Without\r\nany backing they began an investigation. When proof positive was\r\nsecured, through a long search of official records, they laid the case\r\nbefore the Teachers' Federation of 4,000 members, who authorized them\r\nto prosecute it to the end and supplied the necessary funds.\r\n\r\nThey went before the Board of Equalization with proofs that hundreds\r\nof millions of dollars of corporation property was not assessed for\r\ntaxation; but the board refused absolutely to act. Then they filed a\r\nmandamus to compel it to do so, and brought the matter into the\r\ncourts. Every legal, political and financial influence that could be\r\nsecured in the State was used to fight these courageous women. They\r\ncarried the case through the lower courts and into the Supreme Court,\r\nwhich confirmed their contention that these corporations should be\r\ntaxed (Oct 24. 1901.)\r\n\r\nThe Union Traction Company and the Chicago Consolidated Traction\r\nCompany, two of the greatest corporations which for years had been\r\navoiding their legal taxes, applied to the United States Circuit Court\r\nfor an injunction to restrain the State Board of Equalization from\r\nassessing them. They invoked the Fourteenth Amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution, which says that private property shall not be taken\r\nwithout due process of law. The injunction was refused.\r\n\r\nThis decision will increase the revenues of Chicago not less than\r\n$5,000,000 a year, unless some scheme is evolved for circumventing the\r\nlaw, which has not been enforced up to this time. (July, 1902.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the campaign of 1900 both Republican and Democratic clubs of\r\nwomen were formed. The Democratic Club of Chicago announced that it\r\nwould be permanent, and at all times would oppose every legislative\r\nand congressional candidate who should be unfavorable to woman\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nThe Illinois Federation of Women's Clubs has been a great educator. It\r\nwas organized in 1894, and is composed of 225 clubs with a membership\r\nof 20,000. The Chicago Woman's Club is one of the largest in the\r\nUnited States and does a vast amount of practical work.\r\n\r\nMiss Frances E. Willard belonged to Illinois as well as to the world,\r\nand it was through her powerful influence that the great organization\r\nof the W. C. T. U. was first swung into line for the enfranchisement\r\nof women. By voice and pen she aided this cause for over twenty years.\r\n\r\nAmong other staunch supporters are Mrs. Lydia Avery Coonley-Ward,\r\nwhose home and purse and pen are used for the benefit of woman\r\nsuffrage; and her mother, Mrs. Susan Look Avery, who speaks and writes\r\nwith the vigor of youth, although eighty-three years of age. Mrs.\r\nEmily M. Gross is one of the large contributors.\r\n\r\nSenator Miles B. Castle was chairman of the Illinois E. S. A.\r\nexecutive committee for over twenty years, and edited and published\r\nthe State organ, the _Suffragist_, for five years, supplying the\r\ndeficit from his own pocket. The Rev. C. C. Harrah, now of Iowa, did\r\nvaliant service for many years as chairman of the State advisory\r\ncommittee. He sent his leaflet, Jesus Christ the Emancipator of\r\nWoman, at his own expense to hundreds of ministers throughout the\r\ncountry, and it is still in use by the National Association.\r\n\r\nMrs. Eva Munson Smith, vice-president of the State association,\r\npublished a volume entitled Woman in Sacred Song, which contains poems\r\nwritten by 830, and 150 musical compositions by 50 different women.\r\nMrs. Carrie Ashton Johnson, secretary, compiled a popular Suffrage\r\nDime Speaker. Miss Mary H. Krout, for ten years connected with the\r\n_Inter-Ocean_, never has failed to use her influence in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage. Mrs. Fannie H. Rastall gave her services as editor-in-chief\r\nof the _Woman's Forum_ for several years.\r\n\r\nSixteen years ago but one paper in Illinois had a woman's department;\r\nnow this is a feature of all, and 161 are regularly publishing\r\nsuffrage matter furnished by the State press bureau.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[237] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Mary E. Holmes\r\nof Chicago, who has been officially connected with the State Equal\r\nSuffrage Association since 1884.\r\n\r\n[238] State conventions have been held as follows: Watseka, 1884;\r\nGeneseo, 1885; Sandwich, 1886; Galva, 1887; Rockford, 1888; Joliet,\r\n1889; Moline, 1890; Kewanee, 1891; Aurora, 1892; Chicago (World's\r\nFair), 1893; Danville, 1894; Decatur, 1895; Harvey, 1896; Waukegan,\r\n1897; Springfield, 1898; Barry, 1899. The twenty-seventh annual\r\nmeeting took place in Edgewater, Oct. 11, 12, 1900.\r\n\r\n[239] Among the officers for whom the Legislature has the power to\r\nallow women to vote are Presidential electors, members of the State\r\nBoard of Equalization, clerk of the Appellate Court, county collector,\r\ncounty surveyor, members of the Board of Assessors, sanitary district\r\ntrustees, members of the Board of Review, all officers of cities,\r\nvillages and towns (except police magistrates), supervisor, town\r\nclerk, assessor, collector and highway commissioner.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature has power also to permit women to vote on general\r\nquestions submitted to the electors, besides voting in all annual and\r\nspecial town meetings.\r\n\r\n[240] During these years various suffrage bills were introduced by\r\nother organizations. The school board of Winnetka had one to give\r\nwomen a right to vote on all matters relating to schools; the W. C. T.\r\nU. one for a constitutional amendment; and members of the Legislature\r\noccasionally on their own responsibility introduced bills.\r\n\r\n[241] In 1891 an anti-suffrage petition, signed by twelve persons,\r\naroused some interest on account of its novelty. In later Legislatures\r\ntheir petitions do not seem to have appeared, but some of those twelve\r\nsigners can be found composing the Chicago Anti Suffrage Society of\r\nthe present day.\r\n\r\n[242] In April, 1891, fifteen women of Lombard voted at the municipal\r\nelection under a special charter which gave the franchise to citizens\r\nover twenty-one years of age. The judges were about to refuse the\r\nvotes, but Miss Ellen A. Martin, of the law firm of Perry & Martin in\r\nChicago, argued the legal points so conclusively that they were\r\naccepted. No one has contested that election, and the women have\r\nestablished their right to vote.\r\n\r\n[243] Although Dr. Smith was defeated she was really the first woman\r\nwho served as trustee of the State University, for Gov. John P.\r\nAltgeld appointed her to fill a member's unexpired term and she took\r\nher seat one month before Mrs. Flower, serving eighteen months. At the\r\nnext election her name was again placed on the Democratic ticket,\r\nwhich was again defeated.\r\n\r\n[244] They continued to hold delegate conventions every two years to\r\nnominate a woman for trustee, until the Primary Election Law, recently\r\npassed, provided that delegates to nominating conventions must be\r\nelected at the polls.\r\n\r\n[245] During the Legislature of 1873 a Joint Special Committee was\r\nappointed to revise the laws. Through the heroic efforts of Miles B.\r\nCastle in the Senate and Judge James B. Bradwell in the House, with\r\nthe assistance of the veteran law professor and reviser of statutes,\r\nthe Hon. Harvey B. Hurd, a most liberal legislation for women, in all\r\ndirections possible at that time, was secured.\r\n\r\n[246] See History Woman Suffrage, Vol. II, p. 601.\r\n\r\n[247] Mrs. Sewall's report will be found in most public libraries. A\r\ngraphic account of this Congress is contained in the Life and Work of\r\nSusan B. Anthony, Chap. XLI. See also present volume of this History,\r\nChap XIV.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXVIII.\r\n\r\nINDIANA.[248]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe earliest woman suffrage society in Indiana was formed in Dublin\r\nonly three years after that first memorable convention at Seneca\r\nFalls, N. Y., in 1848, and annual meetings were held until the\r\nbeginning of the Civil War, and resumed after its close.\r\n\r\nThat of 1884 took place December 9, 10, in the Methodist Church at\r\nKokomo with delegates present from a number of cities. The resolutions\r\nincluded one of sorrow over the deaths of Frances Dana Gage, a pioneer\r\nsuffragist, and Laura Giddings Julian, daughter of Joshua R. Giddings\r\nand wife of George W. Julian, M. C., both staunch advocates of the\r\nenfranchisement of women, as she herself had been. Dr. Mary F. Thomas,\r\nwho had joined in the call for the first meeting in 1851, was\r\nre-elected president and the Hon. William Dudley Foulke made\r\nvice-president-at-large. Among the speakers were the Reverends\r\nFrazier, Hudson and McCune, Dr. Gifford and Judge Pollard.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1885 was held at Warsaw, October 22, 23, and\r\nwelcomed by Mayor Royse. On account of the advanced age of Dr. Thomas\r\nher resignation was accepted and Mrs. Mary S. Armstrong elected\r\npresident. Henry B. Blackwell and Lucy Stone were present throughout\r\nthe sessions.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1886 met in Richmond, November 8, 9, in the\r\nEighth Street Friends' Meeting House and was welcomed by the Mayor.\r\nAddresses were made by Mr. Blackwell, Mrs. Stone, Mrs. Zerelda G.\r\nWallace, Dr. Thomas, Mr. Foulke, Mrs. Mary E. Haggart, Mrs. Armstrong,\r\nMrs. Mattie Stewart Charles, Sylvester Johnson and others.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the convention took place at La Porte, December 1, 2, and was\r\naddressed by Mr. Foulke, Professor Hailman and Mrs. Eudora F. Hailman,\r\nthe Rev. Mr. Grant, General Packard, Mrs. J. W. Ridgway, Mrs.\r\nRhenton, Sylvanus Grover and others. Mr. Foulke was elected president\r\nand Mrs. Haggart vice-president-at-large.[249]\r\n\r\nUp to this time these annual meetings had been convened under the\r\nauspices of the American Woman Suffrage Association. In 1878 a strong\r\nsociety had been organized in Indianapolis with Mrs. Zerelda G.\r\nWallace, president, Mrs. May Wright Sewall, secretary, and 175\r\nmembers. It had held numerous meetings and done a large amount of\r\nlegislative and political work, but had made no State or national\r\nalliances. In May, 1887, however, it called a convention, which met in\r\nPlymouth Congregational Church, and with the assistance of Miss Susan\r\nB. Anthony a State organization was effected, auxiliary to the\r\nNational Woman Suffrage Association. The officers elected were:\r\nPresident, Mrs. Helen M. Gougar; vice-president-at-large, Mrs.\r\nWallace; secretary, Mrs. Ida Husted Harper; treasurer, Mrs. Juliette\r\nK. Wood; chairman executive committee, Mrs. Sewall; superintendent of\r\npress, Miss Mary E. Cardwill.\r\n\r\nIn November, under the management of this board, two days' conventions\r\nwere held in each of the congressional districts of the State, at\r\nEvansville, Vincennes, Bloomington, Kokomo, Logansport, Wabash,\r\nLafayette, South Bend, Fort Wayne, Muncie, Madison, New Albany and\r\nTerre Haute. The speakers were Miss Anthony, Mrs. Wallace, Mrs. Sewall\r\nand Mrs. Gougar, the meetings being arranged by Mrs. Harper. They were\r\nwell attended, a great deal of suffrage sentiment was aroused and a\r\nbalance was left in the treasury.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention took place at Indianapolis in the Grand Opera\r\nHouse, May 15, 16, 1888, with delegates present from every\r\ncongressional district. Among the speakers were Mr. Foulke, Mrs. Annie\r\nJenness Miller and Miss Anthony. The board of officers was re-elected.\r\n\r\nThe third convention met at Rushville, Oct. 10, 11, 1889. Miss Anthony\r\nwas in attendance. By previous arrangement delegates from the\r\nAmerican branch were present and, with unanimous consent, a union of\r\ntwo bodies into one State organization was effected. Although\r\nreceiving a majority vote, Mrs. Sewall, Miss Cardwill and Mrs. Harper,\r\nfor personal reasons, refused longer to serve. The election finally\r\nresulted: President, Mrs. Gougar; vice-president-at-large, Mrs.\r\nWallace; secretary, Mrs. Caroline C. Hodgin; treasurer, Mrs. Hattie E.\r\nMerrill; chairman executive committee, Mrs. E. M. Seward;\r\nsuperintendent of press, Mrs. Georgia Wright. A resolution was adopted\r\nmourning the death of Dr. Mary F. Thomas.\r\n\r\nState meetings were held for several years afterward, but the records\r\nof them are not available.\r\n\r\nIn 1899, the State association having been apparently defunct for a\r\nlong time, a conference of the officers of the National Association\r\nwas called to meet in Indianapolis, at the earnest request of\r\nMrs. Sewall and a committee. There were present on December\r\n7, 8, Miss Anthony, president, the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nvice-president-at-large, Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, treasurer, Miss\r\nLaura Clay and Mrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch, auditors, and Mrs.\r\nCarrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the organization committee. Mrs.\r\nSewall gave two receptions to enable the people of the city to greet\r\nthem; a large one was given by Mrs. Lucy McDowell Milburn, wife of the\r\nRev. Joseph A. Milburn, of the Second Presbyterian Church; and a\r\nluncheon at the handsome residence of Mrs. Alice Wheeler Peirce by the\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nBusiness meetings were held at the Denison Hotel. The evening\r\nmeetings, in Plymouth Church, were large and enthusiastic. A new State\r\nassociation was formed and also a new local club for Indianapolis,\r\nwhile the staunch and steadfast old societies of Kokomo and Tipton\r\nwere aroused to new activity.[250]\r\n\r\nAt the State meeting in Indianapolis in November, 1900, the old board\r\nof officers was re-elected, except that Mrs. Mary Shank was made\r\nvice-president and Mrs. Ethel B. McMullen, treasurer.\r\n\r\nA very considerable sentiment in favor of woman suffrage exists\r\nthroughout the State and many well-known individuals advocate it,\r\namong them U. S. Senator Albert J. Beveridge and most of the\r\nCongressional delegation, State officials, judges, clergymen and\r\nprominent members of the women's clubs, but there is so slight an\r\norganization that little opportunity is afforded for public expression\r\nor action.\r\n\r\nFrom 1884 down to the present women have appeared many times in person\r\nand by petition before county and State conventions of the different\r\npolitical parties, asking for a recognition in their platforms of the\r\nright of women to the suffrage. Although these efforts have met with\r\nno response from the Democratic party, and none from the Republican in\r\nState meetings, a few county conventions have adopted planks to this\r\neffect. In 1889 the Greenback and the United Labor State Conventions\r\nunequivocally indorsed the franchise for women. In 1892 the Populist\r\nand the Prohibition State platforms contained declarations for woman\r\nsuffrage. In 1894 the Populists again adopted the plank. Similar\r\naction was taken by the Social Democratic Party in 1900. Among those\r\nappearing before these bodies are found the names of Mrs. Sewall, Mrs.\r\nGougar, Mrs. Haggart, Mrs. Pauline T. Merritt, Miss Flora Hardin, Mrs.\r\nFlorence M. Adkinson, Mrs. Augusta Cooper Bristol and Mrs. Harper.\r\n\r\nDuring the past sixteen years a number of women have sat as delegates\r\nin the State conventions of the Greenback, Prohibition, Populist,\r\nSocialist and Labor parties. Women have shown great interest in\r\npolitics for many years, crowding the galleries at the State\r\nconventions and forming at least one-half of the audiences at the\r\ncampaign rallies. Among those who have canvassed the State in national\r\ncampaigns are the noted orators, Miss Anna E. Dickinson, and Mrs.\r\nNellie Holbrook Blinn of California, for the Republican party; Mrs.\r\nMary E. Lease and Mrs. Annie L. Diggs, both of Kansas, for the\r\nPopulist; Miss Cynthia Cleveland for the Democratic, and Mrs. Helen M.\r\nGougar for the Republican, Prohibition and Populist.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: It is most difficult to look up the\r\nhistory of legislation on any subject in Indiana. The original bills\r\nare not printed but are presented in writing, stowed away in\r\npigeon-holes and thenceforth referred to only by number, with perhaps\r\na fragment of their titles. After several women, deeply interested in\r\nthe question, had attempted to make a list of the suffrage bills\r\nduring the last sixteen years and had given up in despair, they\r\nappealed to one of the best lawyers in the State, who is a firm\r\nbeliever in the enfranchisement of women. He responded that no\r\naccurate report could be made without first going through all the\r\npigeon-holes and over all the journals of the two Houses during that\r\nperiod, which would require weeks of time and great expense. As very\r\nfew of these bills ever were reported from the committees, it seemed\r\nunnecessary to undertake their resurrection for the purposes of this\r\nHistory.\r\n\r\nThe Indiana Legislature meets biennially and there is seldom a session\r\nin which bills are not presented for municipal or full suffrage. In\r\n1893 bills were before this body asking for the Municipal ballot, and\r\nnewspaper accounts speak of Mrs. Zerelda G. Wallace, Mrs. Mary S.\r\nArmstrong and Mrs. Laura G. Schofield as working industriously for\r\ntheir passage.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Judge George B. Cardwill introduced two bills without request,\r\none for an amendment to the constitution striking out the word \"male;\"\r\nthe other to amend the law so as to make it obligatory to have one\r\nwoman on the school board of every city. The women made no effort to\r\nsecure consideration of these bills, and they lay dormant in\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nIt never has been thought worth while to make the struggle for School\r\nSuffrage, as Indianapolis is the only city which elects its school\r\nboard. In the others this is appointed by the Common Council.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 5, 1897, Miss Susan B. Anthony, who was visiting Mrs. Sewall,\r\naddressed the Legislature in joint session asking it to recommend to\r\nCongress the passage of a Sixteenth Amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution enfranchising women.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, under the auspices of Mrs. M. A. Tompkins, State\r\nsuperintendent of franchise for the Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion, an active and systematic canvass was begun to secure from the\r\nLegislature the submission of an amendment to the State constitution\r\nto strike out the word \"male.\" She was assisted by members of her\r\norganization in every county; short, convincing articles were\r\nprepared for the newspapers, petitions circulated and 30,000 names of\r\nmen and women obtained.\r\n\r\nAccompanied by these a joint resolution was presented to the\r\nLegislature of 1899--in the Senate by O. Z. Hubbell, in the House by\r\nQuincy A. Blankinship, and both labored strenuously for its passage.\r\nThe Senate Bill was referred to the Committee on Revision of Laws,\r\nFrederick A. Joss, chairman, and the House Bill to the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, Silas A. Canada, chairman. They granted hearings, were\r\naddressed by Miss Marie Brehm of Chicago, national superintendent of\r\nfranchise for the W. C. T. U., and reported the bill favorably. It\r\npassed the Senate by unanimous vote, January 25. The members of the\r\nHouse had been personally interviewed by Mrs. Tompkins and Miss Brehm,\r\nand two-thirds of them were pledged to vote for the measure.\r\n\r\nThe law provides that not more than two bills for amending the State\r\nconstitution can be before the Legislature at one time, and, as two\r\npreceded this one, Speaker Littleton, who was opposed to it, ruled it\r\nout of order and would not permit it to be considered. The same\r\ncondition existed in the Senate but that body deemed its action\r\nperfectly legal, as all which could be done was to submit the bill to\r\nthe next Legislature. Thus all the work of nearly two years was\r\nlost.[251]\r\n\r\nIn 1899 a number of Factory Inspection Laws were passed, some of them\r\nespecially intended to protect women. While these serve their purpose\r\nin one way they may defeat it in another, as those, for instance,\r\nlimiting the work of women to ten hours a day and prohibiting their\r\nemployment at night in any manufacturing concern, when no such\r\nrestrictions are imposed on men, which often is to their advantage\r\nwith employers. Seats for women employes, suitable toilet-rooms and a\r\nfull hour for the noonday meal are commendable features of these new\r\nlaws.\r\n\r\nThrough the efforts of Robert Dale Owen and a few other broad-minded\r\nmen, when the constitution of Indiana was revised in 1851 the laws for\r\nwomen were made more liberal than those of most other States at that\r\nperiod, although conservative compared to present standards. Unjust\r\ndiscriminations have been abolished from time to time since then,\r\nuntil now, in a very large degree, the laws bear equally upon husband\r\nand wife. Some distinctions, however, still exist, as is shown by the\r\nintroduction of bills in almost every Legislature \"to remove the\r\nexisting disabilities of married women.\"\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy are abolished. If a husband die, with or without a\r\nwill, one-third of his real estate descends to the widow in fee\r\nsimple, free from all demands of creditors; provided, however, that\r\nwhere the real estate exceeds in value $10,000, the widow shall have\r\none-fourth only, and where it exceeds $20,000, one-fifth only as\r\nagainst creditors. If a husband die without a will and leave a widow\r\nand one child, the real estate is divided equally between them; the\r\npersonal estate is divided equally if there are not more than two\r\nchildren; if there are more than two the widow still has one-third. If\r\na man has children living by a former marriage and none by a\r\nsubsequent marriage, the widow can have only a life interest in her\r\nshare of his estate. If a wife die, with or without a will, one-third\r\nof her real and personal estate descends to the widower, regardless of\r\nits value, but subject to its proportion of her debts contracted\r\nbefore marriage. If a husband or wife die without a will, leaving no\r\nchild, but father or mother, one or both, three-fourths of the entire\r\nestate goes to the widow or widower, unless it does not exceed $1,000,\r\nin which case it all goes to the widow or widower. If there are\r\nneither children, father nor mother, the entire estate goes to the\r\nwidow or widower.\r\n\r\nThe husband is liable for the wife's debts incurred before marriage to\r\nthe extent of any property received by him through her. He is not\r\nliable for his wife's contracts with respect to her separate property,\r\nbusiness or labor, or for torts committed by her.\r\n\r\nShe may sue in her own name for injury to her person, property or\r\ncharacter. The husband may maintain action for the loss of her society\r\nand services.\r\n\r\nA wife can not convey or encumber her separate real estate without the\r\njoinder of her husband, nor can he do this with his separate real\r\nestate unless she joins. Husband and wife each may dispose of\r\ntwo-thirds of their real and personal estate by will without the\r\nconsent of the other.\r\n\r\nA married woman may without any legal formalities carry on business or\r\ntrade or perform any labor or services on her sole and separate\r\naccount and her earnings shall be her sole and separate property,\r\nprovided she keeps her business distinct from her husband's, as all\r\ntheir joint earnings are his property.\r\n\r\nA wife can act as executor or administrator of an estate only with her\r\nhusband's consent.\r\n\r\nNo married woman can become surety for any person.\r\n\r\nThe father has the custody of the persons and the control of the\r\neducation of the minor children, even though there may be a guardian\r\nappointed for their property. (1896.)\r\n\r\nA wife may sue for support: (1) If deserted by her husband and left\r\nwithout means of support; (2) if he has been convicted of a felony and\r\nput in State prison; (3) if he is a habitual drunkard; (4) if he join\r\na religious society prohibiting marriage. The court may award\r\nnecessary support according to circumstances, may sell lands of the\r\nhusband, or allow the wife to sell her lands without his joining.\r\n(1896.)\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls is 14 years. No bills presented by\r\nwomen to have it raised ever have been allowed to get beyond a\r\nlegislative committee. The penalty is imprisonment in the penitentiary\r\nfrom one to twenty-one years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women possess no form of suffrage. A decision of the Supreme\r\nCourt, Feb. 1, 1901, that an amendment to be adopted must receive a\r\nmajority of the highest number of votes cast at the election, has made\r\nit practically impossible to secure the franchise for women by\r\nchanging the State constitution. It is held, however, by lawyers whose\r\nopinion is of value, that this even now may be legally construed so as\r\nto permit them to vote.\r\n\r\nSustained in her own belief by these views and by a Supreme Court\r\ndecision of 1893, which interpreted this constitution to permit women\r\nto practice law (see Occupations), Mrs. Helen M. Gougar decided to\r\nmake a test case, and offered her vote in the State election, Nov. 6,\r\n1894, at her home in Lafayette. It was refused and she brought suit\r\nagainst the election board in the Superior Court of Tippecanoe County.\r\nSayler & Sayler and John D. Gougar, husband of the plaintiff, were\r\nher attorneys, but she was herself admitted to the bar and argued her\r\nown case before Judge F. B. Everett, Jan. 10, 1895. She based her\r\nmasterly argument on the rights guaranteed to all citizens by the\r\nFederal Constitution, and on the first article of the constitution of\r\nIndiana, which declares that \"the General Assembly shall not grant to\r\nany citizen, or class of citizens, privileges or immunities which,\r\nupon the same terms, shall not equally belong to all citizens;\" and\r\nshe used with deadly effect the parallel between the decision of the\r\nSupreme Court in the case of Antoinette D. Leach, by which she was\r\nenabled to practice law, and the claims which were now being made as\r\nto the right of women to vote.[252]\r\n\r\nThe long, adverse decision of Judge Everett was based upon his\r\ndeclaration that \"suffrage is not a natural right or one necessarily\r\nincident to such freedom and preservation of rights as are upheld by\r\nthe National and State constitutions;\" that \"the intention of their\r\nframers to limit the suffrage to males is so strong that it can not be\r\ndisregarded;\" and that \"the legal and well understood rule of\r\nconstruction is that the express mention of certain things excludes\r\nall others.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Gougar then carried her case to the Supreme Court of Indiana, and\r\nwas herself the first woman admitted to practice before that body. Her\r\nbrief was filed by her attorneys and she made her own argument before\r\nthe full bench, the court-room being crowded with lawyers and members\r\nof the Legislature. It was said by one of the judges to be the\r\nclearest and ablest oral argument presented since he had been a\r\nmember.\r\n\r\nNevertheless the judgment of the lower court was affirmed. The\r\ndecision, in which the five judges concurred, was founded almost\r\nexclusively upon the affirmation that \"that which is expressed makes\r\nthat which is silent cease.\" This decision reversed absolutely the one\r\nrendered in the case of Leach for the right to practice law, which had\r\ndeclared that \"although the statute says voters may practice, it says\r\nnothing about women, and therefore there is no denial of this right to\r\nthem;\" or in other words \"that which is expressed does _not_ make that\r\nwhich is silent cease.\" Yet both of these opinions were written by\r\nthe same Chief Justice--Leonard J. Hackney!\r\n\r\nThe decision closed by saying: \"Whatever the personal views of the\r\nJustices upon the advisability of extending the franchise to women,\r\nall are agreed that under the present constitution it can not be\r\nextended to them.\"\r\n\r\nAs it is practically impossible to amend the State constitution, the\r\noutlook for woman suffrage in Indiana appears hopeless except through\r\nan amendment to the National Constitution.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women are not eligible for election to any offices\r\nwithin the gift of the voters, except those pertaining to the public\r\nschools.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the Legislature enacted that women should be eligible to any\r\noffice the appointment or election to which is or shall be vested in\r\nthe Governor or General Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 it was enacted that women should be eligible to any office\r\nunder the general or special school laws of the State.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these liberal provisions there is scarcely one of the\r\nNorthern States where so few women have served in office. There never\r\nhas been even a woman candidate for that of State Superintendent. Many\r\nyears ago there were a few county superintendents but none now fill\r\nthat office and not half a dozen women ever have sat on local school\r\nboards. These are appointed by the Common Council in all the towns and\r\ncities except Indianapolis. On one occasion its Local Council of Women\r\nnominated two of its members for school trustees, but both were\r\ndefeated. Women themselves were not allowed to vote, but their\r\ninterest brought out an unusually large number of men.[253] At present\r\nnot one woman is known to be filling any school office.\r\n\r\nThe law of 1873 includes the boards of all penal and benevolent\r\ninstitutions, State Librarian, custodians of public buildings, and\r\nmany minor offices, but women have found it practically impossible to\r\nsecure any of these. The explanation for this probably lies in the\r\nfact that Indiana is a pivotal State in politics and the parties are\r\nso evenly divided that the elections are equally apt to be carried by\r\neither party. It thus becomes vitally necessary to utilize every\r\noffice for political purposes and none can be spared to persons\r\nwithout votes. For a number of years the two parties elected women as\r\nState Librarian, and they gave much satisfaction, although several\r\ntimes the political pressure has been so great that the office has had\r\nto be given to men.[254]\r\n\r\nA number of times bills have been presented to require the Governor to\r\nput a representation of women on the boards of all State institutions\r\nwhere women and children are confined, but they never have been\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 the first State prison in the United States exclusively for\r\nwomen was opened in Indianapolis, but the management was vested in a\r\nboard of men with a visiting board of women and a woman\r\nsuperintendent. In 1877 a bill was passed placing the entire\r\nmanagement of this Woman's Reformatory in the hands of women. An\r\nIndustrial School for Girls is now under the same supervision.[255]\r\n\r\nIn 1889 an act of the Legislature established the State Board of\r\nCharities and Corrections and provided that two of its six trustees\r\nshould be women. It exercises supervision over the State penal and\r\nbenevolent institutions. In 1899 a legislative act required that on\r\npetition of fifteen citizens of any county the Circuit Judge must\r\nappoint a board to exercise the same supervision over its\r\ninstitutions, to consist of four men and two women.\r\n\r\nThe only other women serving on State boards are one for the Soldiers'\r\nand Sailors' Orphans' Home at Knightstown and one for the Home for\r\nFeeble-minded Youth at Ft. Wayne.[256]\r\n\r\nThe State Board of Charities and Corrections has made great effort to\r\nsecure women physicians at all State Institutions and, though there is\r\nno law authorizing it, there is now one at each of the four Hospitals\r\nfor the Insane, and at the Woman's Prison and Girls' Industrial\r\nSchool. One was appointed for the Home for Feeble-minded but a man now\r\nholds the position.\r\n\r\nAlmost every State, county and city office has women deputies,\r\nassistants or stenographers. It is said that one-third of the employes\r\nin the State House are women. Many serve as notaries public, and a\r\nnumber as court stenographers.\r\n\r\nThe need of a Police Matron in Indianapolis was so obvious and it had\r\nbeen so impossible to persuade the authorities of this fact, that in\r\nNovember, 1890, the Meridian W. C. T. U. obtained permission from the\r\nMayor and Commissioners to place one on duty at the central station\r\nhouse at their own expense. This was continued until March, 1891, when\r\na change in the city charter vested the authority in a Board of\r\nSafety. The matron, Mrs. Annie M. Buchanan, had given such\r\nsatisfaction that on petition of the Woman's Local Council she was\r\nregularly employed by the city, with full police powers, at a salary\r\nof $60 per month and two furnished rooms for her occupancy. The first\r\nyear 852 women and children came into her charge, 24 of the latter\r\nbeing under five years of age.\r\n\r\nThe State W. C. T. U. appointed Mrs. Buchanan as the head of a\r\nmovement to secure Police Matrons in all cities of 7,000 inhabitants.\r\nA bill for this purpose was presented in 1893 but failed to pass. In\r\n1895 the Local Council of Women also made this a special line of work,\r\nand to Mrs. Buchanan's petition, signed by one hundred of the leading\r\nmen and women of the State and the entire Common Council, were added\r\nthe names of the presidents of the forty-nine societies composing the\r\nCouncil of Women, representing 8,000 members. It asked for a law\r\ncompelling the appointment of Police Matrons in all cities of 10,000\r\ninhabitants. This time the bill passed both Houses but so altered as\r\nto merely permit the Mayor and Commissioners to appoint such Matrons,\r\na power they already possessed.\r\n\r\nMrs. Buchanan remained in office seven years, until her marriage. The\r\nexperiment in Indianapolis has been so successful that matrons are now\r\nemployed in Evansville, Terre Haute, Richmond and Lafayette, but these\r\nby no means include all of the cities of over 10,000 inhabitants.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: The only occupations forbidden to women are those of\r\nworking in mines and selling liquor. Women have served as bank\r\ncashiers and directors for twenty years.\r\n\r\nIn 1875 Miss Elizabeth Eaglesfield was admitted to practice law at\r\nthe Vigo County bar, through the efforts of Judge William Mack, and\r\nhad a number of cases in the courts of Indianapolis. Eighteen years\r\nlater Mrs. Antoinette D. Leach, although properly qualified, was\r\nrefused a license to practice in Greene County. The lower court based\r\nits refusal on a clause in the State Constitution which says: \"Every\r\nperson of good moral character, _being a voter_, shall be entitled to\r\npractice law in all the courts of the State.\" She carried the case to\r\nthe Supreme Court which reversed this judgment. Its decision, June 14,\r\n1893, says that \"while voters are granted admission to practice there\r\nis no _denial_ of such right to women, and it must be held to exist as\r\nlong as not forbidden by law. That which is expressed does not make\r\nthat which is silent cease.\" (See Suffrage on previous page.) The\r\ndecision continued:\r\n\r\n     The right to practice law is not a political question, but\r\n     belongs to that class of rights inherent in every citizen, and\r\n     pertains to the fundamental duty of every inhabitant to gain a\r\n     livelihood. Judge Cooley says: \"To forbid to an individual or a\r\n     class the right to the acquisition or enjoyment of property in\r\n     such manner as should be permitted to the community at large,\r\n     would be to deprive them of liberty in particulars of primary\r\n     importance.\" In Story on the Constitution it is said that the\r\n     right to acquire, possess and enjoy property and to choose from\r\n     those which are lawful the profession or occupation of life, are\r\n     among the privileges which the States are forbidden by the\r\n     Constitution to abridge.[257]\r\n\r\nBasing her claims on this decision, a woman the next year, 1894,\r\napplied for license to sell liquor. This was refused on the ground\r\nthat the statute reads: \"Any _male_ inhabitant having certain other\r\nspecified qualifications may obtain a license.\" The Supreme Court\r\ndecided that \"by the use of the word 'male' women are inhibited from\r\nobtaining license to vend intoxicating liquor at retail.\"\r\n\r\nThus within three years--1893, '94, '95--the same Supreme Court\r\nrendered three decisions each absolutely reversing the others.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The State University was opened to women in 1867. They are\r\nadmitted on equal terms with men to all State institutions of\r\nlearning, including Purdue University (agricultural). The only\r\ncolleges closed to them are Wabash at Crawfordsville, and the Rose\r\nPolytechnic at Terre Haute. There are women on the faculties of most\r\nof the co-educational universities. A number of women have been\r\ngraduated from the various Law and Medical Schools.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 7,252 men and 8,236 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $48.80; of the women $43.55.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Women's Clubs number considerably over one hundred, and there are\r\nalso many which are composed of both men and women. The State Press\r\nAssociation had both as charter members. The Union of Literary Clubs,\r\na strong organization of 104 branches, includes many of these and also\r\nthose composed of women alone and of men alone.\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Club of Indianapolis, founded in 1875, is the oldest in\r\nthe city. Under its auspices and through the inspiration of Mrs. May\r\nWright Sewall, the Propylæum, a handsome club house, was built at a\r\ncost of over $30,000. It was dedicated in 1891 with imposing\r\nceremonies, in which the Governor, the Mayor and many distinguished\r\nguests assisted the board of directors. All of the stock is held by\r\nwomen and the construction was entirely superintended by women. It is\r\none of the important institutions of the city, and is used by a number\r\nof men's and of women's clubs and for many public and private\r\nfunctions.\r\n\r\nIn numerous forms of organized work, sanitary inspection, free\r\nkindergartens, flower missions, training schools for nurses,\r\ncollegiate alumnæ, art associations, musical clubs, industrial unions,\r\npatriotic societies, church missionary boards, lodge auxiliaries and\r\ncountless others--women render conspicuous and inestimable service.\r\nThe State Monograph for the World's Fair, previously referred to,\r\ngives detailed information of the associated work of Indiana women in\r\nnearly fifty distinct departments.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[248] The History is indebted to Mrs. Alice Judah Clarke of Vincennes\r\nfor much of the information contained in this chapter.\r\n\r\n[249] The other names which appear most frequently during these years\r\nas officers and workers are the Rev. A. Marine, Doctors Isabel\r\nStafford and Anna B. Campbell, Miss Mary D. Naylor and Mesdames Laura\r\nC. Schofield, Georgia Wright, Sarah E. Franklin, Laura Sandefur, Laura\r\nC. Arnold, C. A. P. Smith, S. S. McCain, H. R. Ridpath, Mary B.\r\nWilliams, Laura Kregelo, H. R. Vickery, Emma E. Dixon, Pauline T.\r\nMerritt, Eliza J. Hamilton, L. May Wheeler and Florence M. Adkinson.\r\n\r\n[250] State officers: President, Mrs. Bertha G. Wade; vice-president,\r\nMrs. Mary S. Armstrong; corresponding secretary, Mrs. Alice Wheeler\r\nPeirce; recording secretary, Mrs. Hester Moore Hart; treasurer, Mrs.\r\nAlice E. Waugh; auditors, Mrs. Grace Julian Clarke and Mrs. Albertina\r\nA. Forrest.\r\n\r\nAmong the strong members of the Tipton club are Judge and Mrs. Dan\r\nWaugh, State Senator and Mrs. G. W. Gifford, Representative and Mrs.\r\nW. R. Ogleboy, Postmaster and Mrs. M. W. Pershing, Dr. and Mrs. M. V.\r\nB. Newcomer and W. H. Barnhart, editor of the _Advocate_.\r\n\r\n[251] In 1901 the suffrage societies had a similar bill before the\r\nLegislature, supported by a large petition. It was passed by the House\r\non March 5 by 52 ayes, 35 noes. Enough votes to carry it had been\r\npledged in the Senate, but the night following its success in the\r\nHouse hurried consultations were held and the element which fights\r\nwoman suffrage to the death issued its edict. The next morning the\r\nvote was reconsidered and the measure defeated. It was therefore\r\nunnecessary to bring it before the Senate.\r\n\r\n[252] Mrs. Gougar's argument in full, with authorities cited, was\r\npublished in a pamphlet of sixty pages.\r\n\r\n[253] In 1901 the Political Equality Club of Indianapolis put up a\r\nwoman candidate who polled over 4,000 votes but was not elected.\r\n\r\n[254] The women who have filled this office are Sarah A. Oren,\r\n1873-75; Margaret F. Peelle, 1879-1881; Elizabeth O. Callis,\r\n1881-1889; Mary A. Ahern, 1893-1895; Mrs. E. L. Davidson, 1895-1897.\r\nAt present the first and second assistants are women.\r\n\r\n[255] For particulars of this unique institution see Vol. III, p. 970.\r\n\r\n[256] A Monograph on the Associated Work of Indiana Women, prepared in\r\n1893 by Mrs. Ida Husted Harper for the Columbian Exposition, showed\r\nabout twenty county and city orphans' home entirely controlled by\r\nwomen, and also a number of Homes for the Friendless, Old Ladies'\r\nHomes, Children's Aid Societies, etc.\r\n\r\n[257] Some of the highest legal authorities in the State declare that\r\nthis is not the law and that it will be so decided whenever the\r\nquestion is presented to another Supreme Court. If this should happen\r\nthen women could practice law only by an amendment of the\r\nconstitution. What then would be the status of the cases in which Mrs.\r\nLeach and other women had acted as attorney?\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XXXIX.\r\n\r\nIOWA.[258]\r\n\r\n\r\nFor thirty years the women of Iowa have been petitioning its\r\nlegislative body for the elective franchise. Any proposed amendment to\r\nthe State constitution must pass two successive Legislatures before\r\nbeing submitted to the voters, which makes it exceedingly difficult to\r\nsecure one. Throughout the State, however, there has been a steady,\r\nhealthy growth of favorable sentiment and the cause now numbers its\r\nfriends by thousands.\r\n\r\nThe Iowa Equal Suffrage Association was formed in 1870 and ever since\r\nhas held annual conventions. That of 1884 took place in Des Moines,\r\nNovember 27, 28, Mrs. Narcissa T. Bemis presiding. The report of the\r\nvice-president, Mrs. Jane Amy McKinney, stated that Miss Matilda\r\nHindman of Pennsylvania had been employed two months of the year,\r\nbesides working several weeks upon her own responsibility. She had\r\ndelivered seventy-two lectures, formed about forty organizations and\r\nobtained many hundreds of names to pledges of help. Mrs. Helen M.\r\nGougar of Indiana had given fifteen addresses, distributed 3,000\r\ntracts and secured 500 subscribers for her paper, _Our Herald_. Mrs.\r\nMariana T. Folsome, financial secretary, had gone from town to town,\r\narranging her own meetings and visiting many places where no suffrage\r\nwork ever before had been done. Mrs. Margaret W. Campbell, State\r\norganizer, had addressed 139 meetings and assisted in organizing ten\r\ncounties. Letters urging a Sixteenth Amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution had been written to all the Iowa members of Congress.\r\n\r\nThe convention met Oct. 21, 22, 1885, in Cedar Rapids, and elected\r\nMrs. Campbell president. Lucy Stone and Henry B. Blackwell delivered\r\nevening addresses, while among the delegates was Mrs. Carrie Lane\r\nChapman (Catt). Mrs. Mary J. Coggeshall, chairman of the executive\r\ncommittee, reported that each of the eleven congressional districts\r\nhad been given in charge of a vice-president of the State association,\r\nlocal societies had been formed, numerous public meetings held and\r\nseventeen counties organized. Petitions were in circulation asking the\r\nLegislature to amend the constitution of the State so as to\r\nenfranchise women, and others that women be excused from paying taxes\r\nuntil they had representation. About forty weekly papers had columns\r\nedited by the press committee. At the State Agricultural Fair this\r\ncommittee had, as usual, a large amount of literature in a handsomely\r\ndecorated booth, which was crowded with visitors from all parts of the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1886 the annual meeting convened in Ottumwa. During\r\nthat year funds had been raised and a permanent cottage erected on the\r\nState Fair grounds to be used as suffrage headquarters. There was also\r\nestablished in Des Moines a State paper, the _Woman's Standard_, with\r\nMrs. Coggeshall as editor and Mrs. Martha C. Callanan as business\r\nmanager. This paper, an eight-page monthly, issued its first number in\r\nSeptember.[259]\r\n\r\nThe State Convention of 1887 was held in Des Moines, and that of 1888\r\nin Ames. At the latter Miss Susan B. Anthony gave an inspiring\r\naddress. The State Agricultural College is located at Ames, and Capt.\r\nJames Rush Lincoln of the military department tendered the delegates\r\nan exhibition drill on the campus of Company G, which was composed\r\nentirely of girls.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention took place in Oskaloosa, Oct. 30-Nov. 1, 1889. A\r\nletter of approval was received from George A. Gates, president of\r\nIowa College. Mr. Blackwell and Lucy Stone were present and added much\r\nto the interest of the meetings. Mrs. Campbell was for the third time\r\nelected president.\r\n\r\nOn Dec. 4, 5, 1890, the association again assembled in Des Moines,\r\nwith Miss Anthony in attendance. The resolutions recommended that the\r\nsuffragists make an effort to place women on all the school boards,\r\nand that they work for the election of legislators favoring Municipal\r\nand School Suffrage for women.\r\n\r\nThe society was incorporated under the State laws Nov. 7, 1891, as the\r\nIowa Equal Suffrage Association. The twentieth convention was held at\r\nAmes, December 3, 4. Three departments of work were arranged--fair,\r\npress and oratorical contest--and a superintendent of each was\r\nappointed. Reports were received from all parts of the State which\r\nindicated an increasing growth of sentiment and it was decided to\r\nplace another organizer in the field. The delegates were invited by\r\nPresident William Beardshear to visit the State Agricultural College.\r\nUpon their return they passed a resolution declaring that \"the\r\nLegislature ought to provide a suitable hall for women students.\"\r\nMargaret Hall has since been erected, a commodious building designed\r\nfor their exclusive use.\r\n\r\nThe twenty-first annual meeting was called at Des Moines, Sept. 22,\r\n1892, in connection with the Mississippi Valley Suffrage Conference.\r\nThere were present Miss Anthony, president of the National\r\nAssociation, Mr. Blackwell, Senator M. B. Castle and Mrs. Catharine\r\nWaugh McCulloch of Illinois, Miss Laura Clay of Kentucky, Mrs. Sarah\r\nBurger Stearns of Minnesota and many others from different States. The\r\nreport of Mrs. Eliza H. Hunter, chairman of the executive committee,\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     In no previous year has the demand upon our workers been so\r\n     great, and never has the response been so quick and hearty. Mrs.\r\n     Chapman Catt, Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe of Illinois, the Rev. Olympia\r\n     Brown of Wisconsin, and Mrs. Belle Mitchell of Iowa, have been\r\n     our lecturers and organizers. The association was invited to send\r\n     a speaker to the Chautauqua Assembly at Colfax and the Rev. C. C.\r\n     Harrah was secured. A plan of work prepared by Mrs. Chapman Catt\r\n     was issued as a supplement to the _Woman's Standard_, and sent to\r\n     every county president and local club. Mrs. Callanan published at\r\n     the same time the Iowa Collection of Readings and Recitations for\r\n     suffrage societies. The study topics arranged for clubs two years\r\n     ago had been in such demand that a new supply was necessary. We\r\n     also have had printed 6,000 copies of a tract, A Woman Suffrage\r\n     Catechism, by Mrs. C. Holt Flint. The State Agricultural Society\r\n     by request set apart one day of the fair as Woman's Day, and five\r\n     women's organizations took part in the exercises. At the hour\r\n     devoted especially to suffrage Mrs. DeVoe made the address, Mrs.\r\n     Coggeshall presiding. It was hard to tell where this hour began\r\n     and ended, for to the listener all seemed suffrage hours.\r\n\r\nThis report told also of a series of questions sent out which\r\nascertained that, in the territory covered by twenty-eight clubs,\r\nseventy-eight ministers were in favor of suffrage and eighteen\r\nopposed; and in the same territory forty editors were in favor and\r\nnineteen opposed. There were at that time fifty-seven clubs in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nThe year 1893 marked a period of unusual activity. The executive\r\ncommittee held monthly meetings. Four organizers were kept in the\r\nfield. A large amount of money was raised and $100 donated to the\r\ncampaign in Colorado. A request was sent to the clubs that each\r\ncontribute to the campaign in Kansas, which in many instances was\r\ndone. The annual meeting took place in Webster City, November 9, 10.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1894 was held in Marshalltown, November 8, 9. That\r\nof 1895 met in Des Moines, October 18, 19. Mrs. Laura M. Johns of\r\nKansas was secured for a month of organization work and the suffrage\r\nenrollment ordered to be continued.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Mrs. Adelaide Ballard was elected State organizer. At the\r\nState Fair Mrs. Pauline Swalm delivered an address on The Woman\r\nCitizen. The suffrage cottage was kept open and a long list of names\r\nwas placed upon the enrollment books. The annual meeting convened in\r\nIndependence, November 17-19. Mrs. Ballard reported thirty-seven new\r\nclubs organized. Mrs. Anna H. Satterly announced that forty-two\r\nnewspapers were publishing articles furnished by the National\r\nAssociation, which also sent Mrs. DeVoe for a month's work in the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1897, the National Association held its convention in Des\r\nMoines, with many noted women in attendance.[260] This gave a great\r\nimpetus to the work and had a decided effect upon sentiment in the\r\nState, particularly on that of the daily papers in Des Moines, most of\r\nwhich since this time have treated the cause with marked courtesy. At\r\nthe close of the convention fifty members were added to the city club.\r\nThe National Association heartily approved the plan of an active\r\ncampaign with a view to securing the submission of a suffrage\r\namendment from the Legislature. Under the directions of Mrs. Chapman\r\nCatt, chairman of its organization committee, workers were sent into\r\nthe field to hold a series of conventions for the purpose of\r\nperfecting the organization of the State. These resulted in county\r\nsocieties in ninety-four of the ninety-nine counties and one hundred\r\nnew clubs. The speakers were the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, national\r\nvice-president-at-large, and the Rev. Henrietta G. Moore of Ohio; the\r\nmanagers, Miss Mary G. Hay of New York and Miss Laura A. Gregg of\r\nKansas. Mrs. Ballard and Mrs. Clara M. Richey each gave a month to\r\nconducting meetings, and other Iowa women rendered valuable\r\nassistance.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1897 took place in Des Moines, October 13-15.\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt, Miss Hay, Miss Moore and Mrs. Addie M. Johnson of\r\nMissouri were present. Much enthusiasm was manifested and $1,400 were\r\nraised to carry on the next year's work. It was decided to open\r\nheadquarters in Des Moines the first of January, 1898, with Mrs. Ina\r\nLight Taylor as office secretary.\r\n\r\nBeginning in April, 1898, the State association conducted a series of\r\nconferences throughout the northern part of Iowa, employing as\r\nspeakers Mrs. Campbell and Mrs. Ballard; and as managers Miss Ella\r\nHarrison of Missouri and Mrs. Richey. At the same time the National\r\nAssociation sent into the southern part Miss Moore and Mrs. Martha A.\r\nB. Conine of Colorado, as speakers, and Miss Gregg and Mrs. Jennie L.\r\nWilson as managers. The annual meeting was held in Council Bluffs,\r\nOctober 19-21. Mrs. Evelyn H. Belden was made president.\r\n\r\nDuring 1899 a large amount of work was done by correspondence. The\r\noffice of press superintendent was transferred to headquarters, from\r\nwhich 200 newspapers were supplied each week with suffrage matter. Two\r\nhundred and fifty clubs were in active existence. The convention met\r\nin Mason City, October 10-12. Mrs. Belden was unanimously re-elected\r\nand $1,500 were raised.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1900 was held in Des Moines, October 16-18, with\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt in attendance. During the year Mrs. Nellie Welsh\r\nNelson had done organization work in northwestern Iowa, and Miss Hay\r\nand Dr. Frances Woods lately had held a number of meetings and formed\r\nseveral clubs. One thousand dollars were pledged to continue the State\r\nheadquarters. Mrs. Belden was again elected to the presidency, and\r\nthe association entered upon the new century bearing the banner it had\r\nfollowed for thirty years, with the inscription, \"Never give up.\"[261]\r\n\r\nYear after year the executive committee have visited the State\r\nconventions of all the political parties asking for a plank in their\r\nplatforms indorsing equal suffrage, but without success. Many of the\r\nprominent officials and political leaders, however, have openly\r\ndeclared in favor of the enfranchisement of women.[262]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: From its organization in 1870 the State\r\nassociation has had a bill before every Legislature asking some form\r\nof suffrage for women. This usually has passed one House but never\r\nboth at the same session. The petitions accompanying these bills have\r\nvaried from 8,000 signatures in 1884 to 100,000 in 1900. In 1884 the\r\nmeasure was carried in the Senate but lost in the House.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 a bill for Municipal Suffrage was introduced by Representative\r\nJ. A. Lyons, amended to include School Suffrage and recommended for\r\npassage, but it never came to a vote.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 a bill for Municipal and School Suffrage was lost in the House\r\nby 11 ayes, 80 noes. This was presented in the Senate also but never\r\nvoted upon.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 a bill for School Suffrage was recommended for passage in the\r\nHouse but did not reach a vote. A bill for Municipal Suffrage at the\r\nsame session was not reported. Both were killed in the Senate\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a bill allowing women to vote for Presidential Electors was\r\nintroduced in the House but was unfavorably reported and indefinitely\r\npostponed. In the Senate it was referred to the Committee on Suffrage\r\nand never reported.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 a bill for Municipal and School Suffrage was favorably\r\nreported in the House. It was made a special order and, after being\r\namended so as to give women the right to vote _only when bonds were to\r\nbe issued_, it was returned to the Judiciary Committee. They reported\r\nit without recommendation for the reason that they were not agreed as\r\nto its constitutionality. It was passed by 51 ayes, 39 noes. In the\r\nSenate the amended bill passed by 27 ayes, 20 noes.\r\n\r\nThe greatest difficulty in the way of securing Municipal or School\r\nSuffrage was the opinion prevalent among legislators that it would be\r\nunconstitutional. In view of this fact the State association decided\r\nto drop all partial suffrage measures and ask only for the Full\r\nFranchise by constitutional amendment.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 a legislative committee was appointed with Mrs. Belden, State\r\npresident, as chairman. Assisted by Miss Mary G. Hay of New York, she\r\nspent some time at the capital trying to secure a joint resolution for\r\nthe submission of an amendment. The resolution was lost in the House\r\nby 50 ayes, 47 noes--just one short of a constitutional majority,\r\nwhich is one over a half of the whole number of members. It did not\r\ncome to a vote in the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 Mrs. Belden established headquarters at the Savery House in\r\nDes Moines, and with other members of the legislative committee\r\nconducted a vigorous campaign for submission. The bill was reported\r\nfavorably by unanimous vote of both House and Senate committees, but\r\nwas lost in the House by 44 ayes, 55 noes. Subsequently it passed the\r\n\"sifting committee,\" for the first time in the history of suffrage\r\nlegislation in the State. It was then acted upon by the Senate and\r\nlost by 24 ayes, 23 noes--lacking two votes of a constitutional\r\nmajority. The absence on account of illness of some of the friends of\r\nthe measure contributed to this result. In the meantime work had been\r\ndone in the House by Mrs. Belden and the Hon. G. W. Hinkle which had\r\nmade it certain that if the bill was carried in the Senate the House\r\nwould reconsider and pass it. The bill was treated with courtesy and\r\nfairness and instead of ignoring its claims men came voluntarily to\r\ntalk about it and showed a genuine interest.\r\n\r\nThe laws of inheritance are the same for husband and wife. Dower and\r\ncurtesy are abolished. The surviving husband or wife is entitled to\r\none-third in fee simple of both real and personal estate of the other\r\nat his or her death. If either die intestate, leaving no issue,\r\none-half of the estate goes to the survivor, the rest to his or her\r\nparents, one or both; or if they are both dead, to their descendants.\r\nIf there are none such, the whole estate goes to the surviving husband\r\nor wife. If there should have been more than one wife or husband, the\r\nhalf portion is equally divided between the husband or wife living and\r\nthe heirs of those who are dead, or the heirs of all, if all are dead.\r\n\r\nA married woman may contract, sue and be sued and carry on business in\r\nher own name as if unmarried and her earnings are her sole and\r\nseparate property.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 an act was passed making it illegal for the husband to\r\nmortgage household goods without the wife's signature. The same year\r\nit was made a misdemeanor and punishable as such for a man to desert a\r\nwoman whom he married to escape prosecution for seduction.\r\n\r\nThe law declares the father and mother natural guardians and legally\r\nentitled to the custody of the minor children, but in practice the\r\nfather has prior claim.\r\n\r\nThe support and education of the family are chargeable equally on the\r\nhusband's and the wife's property.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 13\r\nyears; and in 1896, on petition of the Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion, from 13 to 15 years. The penalty is imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary for life or for any term of years not less than twenty.\r\nAn amendment was made in 1894 that \"a man can not be convicted upon\r\nthe testimony of the person injured unless she be corroborated by\r\nother evidence.\"\r\n\r\nThe same year this organization secured a law compelling the\r\nseparation of men and women prisoners in county jails.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Since 1894 the right of any citizen to vote at any city,\r\ntown or school election, on the question of issuing any bonds for\r\nmunicipal or school purposes, and for the purpose of borrowing money,\r\nor on the question of increasing the tax levy, shall not be denied or\r\nabridged on account of sex.\r\n\r\nAt all elections where women may vote, no registration of women shall\r\nbe required, separate ballots shall be furnished for the question on\r\nwhich they are entitled to vote, a separate ballot-box shall be\r\nprovided in which all ballots cast by them shall be deposited, and a\r\nseparate canvass thereof made by the judges of the election, and the\r\nreturns thereof shall show such vote.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women are not forbidden by law to hold any office\r\nexcept that of legislator.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 thirteen women were serving as county superintendents and ten\r\nas superintendents of city schools; six were presidents, thirty-five\r\nsecretaries and fifty treasurers of school boards. In 1885 the school\r\nboard of Des Moines elected a woman city superintendent at a salary of\r\n$1,800, with charge of eighty teachers, including two male principals.\r\nIn 1900 twenty-one women were elected county superintendents. A large\r\nnumber are acting as school trustees but it is impossible to get the\r\nexact figures.\r\n\r\nThe office of State librarian always was filled by a woman until 1898,\r\nwhen Gov. Leslie M. Shaw placed a man in charge. The librarian of the\r\nState University always has been a woman. There are two women on the\r\nLibrary Board of Des Moines.\r\n\r\nClerkships in the Legislature and in the executive offices are\r\nfrequently given to women.\r\n\r\nFor six years Mrs. Anna Hepburn was recorder of Polk County, and this\r\noffice has been held by women in other counties.\r\n\r\nA law of 1892 requires cities of over 25,000 inhabitants to employ\r\npolice matrons. They wear uniform and star and have the same authority\r\nas men on the force, with this difference in their appointment: The\r\nlaw makes it permanent and they can not be dismissed unless serious\r\ncharges are proved against them.\r\n\r\nA woman has been appointed a member of the Board of Examiners for the\r\nLaw Department of the State University. For a number of years women\r\nhave been sitting on the State boards of Charities and Reforms. They\r\nhave served on the Board of Trustees of the Soldiers' Orphans' Home. A\r\nwoman is on the State Board of Education, and another on the State\r\nLibrary Commission.\r\n\r\nThe law provides that women physicians may be employed in the State\r\nhospitals for the insane, but only two or three have been appointed.\r\nThe Board of Control may appoint a woman on the visiting committee for\r\nthese asylums but this has not yet been done. A few women have served\r\non this board.\r\n\r\nThe law also provides for women physicians in all State institutions\r\nwhere women are placed, but does not require them.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of 1900 passed a bill to establish a Woman's\r\nIndustrial Reformatory of which the superintendent must be a woman.\r\nThe salary is $1,000 a year.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen. In 1884 Iowa furnished, at Marion, what is believed to be the\r\nfirst instance of the election of a woman as president of a United\r\nStates national bank.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The universities and colleges, including the State\r\nAgricultural College, always have been co-educational.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 5,855 men and 22,839 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $37.10; of the women, $31.45.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe women of Iowa have thrown themselves eagerly into the great club\r\nmovement, and clubs literary, philanthropic, scientific and political\r\nabound. The State Federation numbers 300 of these with a membership of\r\n12,000. This, however, does not include nearly all the women's\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nBy all the means at their command women are striving to fit themselves\r\nfor whatever duties the future may have in store for them. With an\r\nunfaltering trust in the manhood of Iowa men, those who advocate\r\nsuffrage are waiting--and working while they wait--for the time when\r\nmen and women shall stand side by side in governmental as in all other\r\nvital matters.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[258] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Clara M. Richey\r\nof Des Moines, recording secretary of the State Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n[259] The _Woman's Standard_ has continued to be a source of pride to\r\nIowa women up to the present time, and is now edited by J. O.\r\nStevenson and published by Mrs. Sarah Ware Whitney.\r\n\r\n[260] See Chapter XVII.\r\n\r\n[261] The following have served as presidents, beginning with 1884:\r\nMrs. Narcissa T. Bemis, Mrs. Margaret W. Campbell (four terms), Mrs.\r\nMary B. Welch, Mrs. Mary J. Coggeshall (two terms), Mrs. Estelle T.\r\nSmith (two terms), Mrs. Rowena Stevens, Mrs. M.

A\r\nfew of the most prominent not already named are George W. Bemis;\r\nMesdames Irene Adams, Virginia Branner, S. J. Cole, S. J. Cottrell,\r\nMary E. Emsley, Clara F.

They did not\r\nsucceed in this but to them is largely due its remarkably liberal\r\nprovisions regarding women.[264]\r\n\r\nAfterwards local suffrage societies were formed but there was no\r\nattempt to have a State association until 1884. In the winter of that\r\nyear Mrs. Bertha H. Ellsworth was sent to the National Convention at\r\nWashington by the society of Lincoln, and she returned enthusiastic\r\nfor organization. After some correspondence the first convention was\r\ncalled by Mrs. Hetta P. Mansfield, who had been appointed\r\nvice-president of Kansas by the National Association, and it met in\r\nthe Senate Chamber at Topeka, June 25. Mrs. Helen M. Gougar, who was\r\nmaking a lecture tour of the State, was invited to preside, and Mrs.\r\nAnna C. Wait, president of the five-year-old society at Lincoln and\r\nfor many years the strongest force behind the movement, acted as\r\nsecretary.[265] Telegrams of greeting were received from Lucy Stone\r\nand Henry B. Blackwell, editors of the _Woman's Journal_. At the\r\nevening meeting Mrs. Ellsworth recited an original poem and Mrs.\r\nGougar delivered a fine address to a large audience. Professor W. H.\r\nCarruth, of the University of Kansas, assisted, coming as delegate\r\nfrom a flourishing suffrage society at Lawrence, of which Miss Sarah\r\nA. Brown was president and Mrs. Annie L. Diggs secretary. A\r\nconstitution was adopted and Mrs. Mansfield was elected president;\r\nMrs. Wait, vice-president; Mrs. Ellsworth, corresponding secretary.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1884 Mrs. Ellsworth and Mrs. Clara B. Colby of\r\nNebraska, made an extended lecture and organizing tour. At Salina they\r\nmet and enlisted Mrs. Laura M. Johns, and then began the systematic\r\nwork which rapidly brought Mrs. Johns to the front as the leader of\r\nthe suffrage forces in Kansas. In addition to her great ability as an\r\norganizer, she is an unsurpassed manager of conventions, a forceful\r\nwriter, an able speaker and a woman of winning personality.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 15, 16, 1885, the State association held its annual meeting in\r\nTopeka, during the first week of the Legislature. Its chief business\r\nwas to secure the introduction of a bill granting Municipal Woman\r\nSuffrage, in which it succeeded. Mrs. Gougar was an inspiring figure\r\nthroughout the convention, addressing a large audience in Assembly\r\nHall. A Committee on the Political Rights of Women was secured in the\r\nLower House by a vote of 75 yeas, 45 nays, after a spirited contest.\r\nOne was refused in the Senate by a tie vote. Much interest and\r\ndiscussion among the members resulted and a favorable sentiment was\r\ncreated. Mrs. Wait was made president, Mrs. Johns, vice-president. A\r\nsecond convention was held this year in Salina, October 28, 29, with\r\n\"Mother\" Bickerdyke and Mrs. Colby as the principal speakers. A large\r\namount of work was planned, all looking to the end of securing\r\nMunicipal Suffrage from the next Legislature.\r\n\r\nDuring 1886 the State Woman's Christian Temperance Union, under the\r\npresidency of Mrs. Fannie H. Rastall, zealously co-operated with the\r\nsuffrage association in the effort for the Municipal Franchise, Miss\r\nAmanda Way, Mrs. Sarah A. Thurston, Miss Olive P. Bray and many other\r\nable women making common cause with its legislative committee and\r\nworking for the bill. About 9,000 suffrage documents were distributed.\r\n\r\nThis autumn eleven conventions in the congressional districts of the\r\nState were held under the efficient management of Mrs. Johns and Mrs.\r\nWait, beginning at Leavenworth, October 4, 5, and following at\r\nAbilene, Lincoln, Florence, Hutchinson, Wichita, Anthony, Winfield,\r\nIndependence, Fort Scott and Lawrence. Miss Susan B. Anthony,\r\nvice-president-at-large of the National Association, Mrs. Colby and\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Lyle Saxon of New Orleans, were the speakers. They were\r\ngreeted by crowded houses, Miss Anthony especially receiving an\r\novation at every place visited.\r\n\r\nIn October the American W. S. A. held its national convention in\r\nTopeka. Lucy Stone, Henry B. Blackwell, the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw and\r\nMrs. Julia Ward Howe, of Massachusetts, and the Hon. William Dudley\r\nFoulke and Mrs. Mary E. Haggart, of Indiana, were present. The meeting\r\nwas of incalculable benefit at this time. For the next few months Mrs.\r\nGougar, with her strong speeches, was everywhere in demand; Mrs. Saxon\r\nwas continuously at work; Mrs. Zerelda G. Wallace of Indiana made a\r\nnumber of powerful addresses, and the whole State was aroused in the\r\ninterest of the bill.\r\n\r\nInstead of holding the usual State convention in 1886 it met in\r\nTopeka, Jan. 11-13, 1887, when the Legislature was in session, and was\r\nlargely attended for success seemed near at hand. Mrs. Belva A.\r\nLockwood of Washington, D. C., made an able address. The other\r\nspeakers were Professor Carruth, the Rev. C. H. Rogers, Mrs. Saxon and\r\nMrs. Colby. Miss Sarah A. Brown, as chairman of the committee,\r\nreported a resolution urging the Legislature to confer Municipal\r\nSuffrage on women, which was unanimously carried, and the most\r\ndetermined purpose to secure its passage by the Legislature then in\r\nsession was manifested. Mrs. Johns was elected president, an office\r\nwhich she held eight consecutive years.\r\n\r\nThe bill passed and became a law February 15. The next annual meeting\r\ntook place in Newton, Oct. 13-15, 1887, with the usual large\r\nattendance.[266] Miss Anthony, Mr. Blackwell, the Rev. Miss Shaw and\r\nRachel G. Foster (Avery) were the speakers from abroad. Two notable\r\nevents were the appearance of Kansas' first woman mayor, Mrs. M. D.\r\nSalter of Argonia, and the reading of a carefully compiled statement\r\nrelative to the first vote of women in the towns and cities at the\r\nelection the preceding April. This paper was the work of Judge Francis\r\nG. Adams, for many years secretary of the State Historical Society,\r\nand a lifelong friend and helper of woman's enfranchisement. It\r\nanswered conclusively the question whether women would vote if they\r\nhad an opportunity.\r\n\r\nThis convention was followed by a very successful series of meetings\r\nin many cities to arouse public sentiment in favor of Full Suffrage,\r\nunder the management of Mrs. Johns and Mrs. Letitia V. Watkins, State\r\norganizer, with Miss Anthony, Miss Shaw and Miss Foster as speakers.\r\nConsiderable attention was given to the speech recently made by U. S.\r\nSenator John J. Ingalls at Abilene, vigorously opposing woman\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary A. Woodbridge of the National, and Mrs. Rastall of the\r\nKansas W. C. T. U., also made an active canvass of the State. These\r\norganizations united in a strong appeal to women to be equal to their\r\nnew responsibilities, which was supplemented by one from the national\r\npresident, Miss Frances E. Willard.\r\n\r\nThe State convention met at Emporia, Nov. 13-15, 1888, with Miss\r\nAnthony as its most inspiring figure. A notable feature was the\r\naddress of Mrs. Johns, the president, in which she said:\r\n\r\n     And this brings me to speak of our attitude toward political\r\n     parties. Whatever may be the individual preferences of the\r\n     officers of our State Association, _our organization is\r\n     non-partisan_. I have hitherto regarded it as necessary that it\r\n     should be strictly non-partisan, just as I have believed that it\r\n     must remain non-sectarian, so that no one of any faith, political\r\n     or religious, shall be shut out from our work.... I believe that\r\n     this attitude toward sects will be necessary to the day of our\r\n     full enfranchisement; but not as it now is will our relations to\r\n     _party_ remain. The time is not yet ripe perhaps, but the years\r\n     will not be many to go over our heads before we shall feel the\r\n     necessity of declaring our allegiance to a party, and it is\r\n     possible that to this we will be compelled to come before we\r\n     secure an amendment to the constitution of the State striking out\r\n     the word \"male.\"\r\n\r\nA strong speech was made by Secretary Adams, urging that women should\r\ndo aggressive political work with a view of securing the franchise.\r\nFrom this time on women were not only welcomed as political allies,\r\nbut their influence and active participation were sought in party\r\npolitics. Many women lent their aid chiefly owing to their belief\r\nthat they would thus become so valuable as to win party support to\r\ntheir full enfranchisement; others were enlisted by reason of their\r\ninterest and devotion to the issues. Whether for good or ill as it\r\nshould affect full suffrage, Kansas women thenceforth entered fully\r\ninto party affiliations, but as individuals and not as representing\r\nthe suffrage association.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1889 assembled in Wichita, October 1-3. Miss\r\nAnthony was an honored guest and among those who made addresses were\r\nMrs. Colby, Mrs. Mary D. Lowman, mayor of Oskaloosa, and the Hon.\r\nRandolph Hatfield.\r\n\r\nAt the convention of 1890 in Atchison, November 18-20, Miss Anthony\r\nwas again present accompanied by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt and Mrs.\r\nColby.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1891 was held in Topeka, November 20, 21. During\r\nthe past year the great political change from Republicanism to\r\nPopulism had taken place in Kansas. Women had been among the most\r\npotent factors in this revolution, and as woman suffrage was at that\r\ntime a cardinal principle of the Populist party, and there always had\r\nbeen considerable sentiment in favor of it among Republicans, the\r\nprospects of obtaining the Full Franchise seemed very bright.\r\n\r\nIn February and March of 1892 a series of thirty two-days' conventions\r\nwas held in the congressional districts and in nearly one-third of the\r\ncounties of the State, attended by great crowds. Miss Jennie Broderick\r\nwas chairman of the committee, Mrs. Rachel Foster Avery secretary and\r\ntreasurer, and Mrs. Martha Powell Davis, Mrs. Martia L. Berry, Mrs.\r\nDiggs and Mrs. Wait were the other members. Mrs. Avery contributed\r\n$1,000 toward this canvass. Outside speakers were Miss Florence\r\nBalgarnie of England, Mrs. Mary Seymour Howell of New York, Mrs. Clara\r\nC. Hoffman of Missouri, and the Rev. Miss Shaw. The State speakers\r\nwere Mesdames S. A. Thurston, May Belleville Brown, Elizabeth F.\r\nHopkins, J. Shelly Boyd and Caroline L. Denton. Mrs. Johns arranged\r\nall of these conventions, presided one day or more over each and spoke\r\nat every one, organizing in person twenty-five of the thirty-one local\r\nsocieties which were formed as a result of these meetings.\r\n\r\nThe first week in June a two-days' suffrage conference was held at\r\nthe Ottawa Chautauqua Assembly, with the assistance of Miss Anthony,\r\npresident, and Miss Shaw, vice-president-at-large of the National\r\nAssociation. From here Miss Anthony went to the State Republican\r\nConvention, in session at Topeka, accompanied by Mrs. Johns, Mrs.\r\nHopkins and Mrs. Brown, officers of the State suffrage society. They\r\nwere joined by Miss Amanda Way and \"Mother\" Bickerdyke, and by\r\nunanimous vote all of these ladies were given seats upon the floor of\r\nthe convention. Miss Anthony was invited to address the body,\r\nconducted to the platform amid ringing cheers and her remarks were\r\ncordially received. Later several of the ladies addressed the\r\nresolutions committee, and the final result, by 455 yeas, 267 nays,\r\nwas a plank in the platform unequivocally declaring for the submission\r\nof an amendment to the constitution to enfranchise women. A similar\r\nplank already had been adopted by the Populist State Convention at\r\nWichita with great enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nDuring the autumn campaign following, Mrs. Diggs and other women spoke\r\nfrom the Populist platform, and Miss Anthony, Mrs. Johns and Mrs. T.\r\nJ. Smith from the Republican. Miss Anthony, however, simply called\r\nattention to the record of the Republican party in the cause of human\r\nfreedom, and urged them to complete it by enfranchising women, but did\r\nnot take up political issues.\r\n\r\nThe State convention of 1892 was held at Enterprise, December 6-8, and\r\nthe problem of preserving the non-partisan attitude of the\r\norganization so as to appeal with equal force to Republicans and\r\nPopulists presented itself. With this in view, Mrs. Diggs, a Populist,\r\nwas made vice-president, as support and counsellor of Mrs. Johns, the\r\npresident, who was a prominent Republican, and the association,\r\ndespite the political diversity of its members, was held strictly to a\r\nnon-partisan basis.\r\n\r\nBoth Republicans and Populists having declared for the submission of a\r\nwoman suffrage amendment, the Legislature of 1893 passed a bill for\r\nthis purpose, championed by Representative E. W. Hoch and Senator\r\nHouseholder. From that time forward, Mrs. Johns, Mrs. Diggs and\r\nhundreds of Kansas women of both Republican and Populist faith labored\r\nwith untiring zeal for its success. Nothing was left undone that human\r\nwisdom could plan or human effort carry out.\r\n\r\nOn Sept. 1, 2, 1893, a mass meeting was held in Kansas City at which\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt ably presented the question. Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe\r\nof Illinois agreed to raise $2,000 in the State. Mrs. Thurston, at the\r\nhead of the press bureau, announced that hundreds of papers were\r\npledged to support the amendment; the State Teachers' Association\r\npassed a strong resolution for it; the Grand Army of the Republic was\r\nin favor; Miss Helen L. Kimber related much success in organizing, and\r\nfrom every county came reports of meetings and debates.\r\n\r\nMrs. Johns, State president, went to the National Suffrage Convention\r\nin Washington in the winter of 1894 and made a most earnest appeal for\r\nassistance in the way of speakers and funds, both of which were\r\npromised by the association. She was appointed chairman of the\r\namendment committee with power to name the members,[267] and they\r\nopened up with energy the long campaign of agitation, education and\r\norganization. They started enrollment books, appointed polling\r\ncommittees and undertook to put people to work in every one of the\r\n2,100 voting precincts. The National Association contributed $2,571\r\nand also a number of speakers. A constitutional amendment campaign was\r\nin progress in New York but Miss Anthony made many trips from there to\r\nKansas, and spent months in canvassing the State, donating her\r\nservices during the entire time.\r\n\r\nWork was continued without cessation for the purpose of creating a\r\npublic sentiment which would be strong enough to compel the delegates\r\nto the political State conventions of 1894 to adopt a plank supporting\r\nthis amendment, just as in 1892 they had adopted one asking for it.\r\nBut in 1892 the Populists had swept the State, and in 1894 the\r\nRepublicans were determined to regain possession of it at all hazards.\r\nThe amazement and grief of the Republican women was beyond expression\r\nwhen they learned early in 1894 that their party was going to refuse\r\nindorsement at its convention in June. Every possible influence was\r\nbrought to bear by the State and the National Associations. Miss\r\nAnthony, Miss Shaw and Mrs. Chapman Catt went to Kansas to open the\r\nspring canvass for the women, May 4. They spoke to an immense audience\r\nin Kansas City and a resolution was adopted urging all parties to put\r\na woman suffrage plank in their platforms. Miss Anthony's speech was\r\npublished in full in the Leavenworth _Times_, Col. D. R. Anthony,\r\neditor, and circulated throughout the State. This was the beginning of\r\na great series of two-days' suffrage conventions held by two groups of\r\nspeakers and so \"overlapping\" that meetings were going on in four\r\ncounty seats every day, until 85 of the 105 counties had been reached\r\nin this way. The Rev. Miss Shaw and Mrs. Chapman Catt represented the\r\nNational Association, reinforced by a number of able State speakers.\r\nAll of these meetings were arranged and managed by Mrs. Johns.\r\n\r\nAlthough obliged to return to New York at that time, in three weeks\r\nMiss Anthony went back to Kansas, arriving the day before the\r\nRepublican convention, June 6. Neither she nor Miss Shaw was allowed\r\nto address the resolutions committee, which had been carefully\r\nfortified against all efforts by the appointment as chairman of\r\nex-Gov. C. V. Eskridge, an active opponent of woman suffrage since the\r\nprevious campaign of 1867. Mrs. J. Ellen Foster of Washington, D. C.,\r\nand Mrs. Johns, both strong Republican speakers, were, however,\r\npermitted to present the claims of the women, but the platform was\r\nabsolutely silent, not even recognizing the services of Republican\r\nwomen in municipal politics.\r\n\r\nThe next Saturday night a mass meeting attended by over 1,000 people\r\nwas held in Topeka, Mrs. Diggs presiding, Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw\r\nmaking the addresses.\r\n\r\nEvery effort was now put forth to secure a plank from the Populist\r\nconvention, June 12. There was great opposition, as the party knew the\r\napproaching struggle would be one of life or death. Gov. L. D.\r\nLewelling had asserted he would not stand for re-election on a\r\nplatform which declared for woman suffrage. While the resolutions\r\ncommittee was out, Miss Anthony, Miss Shaw and Mrs. Chapman Catt\r\naddressed the convention amidst great enthusiasm. The majority of the\r\ncommittee, led by its chairman, P. P. Elder, were bitterly opposed to\r\na suffrage plank. It occupied them most of the night, and was defeated\r\nby 13 yeas, 8 nays. The one woman member, Mrs. Eliza Hudson, brought\r\nin a minority report signed by herself and the other seven, and in\r\nspite of every parliamentary tactic it was brought to a debate and\r\ndiscussed four hours, Judge Frank Doster[268] leading the affirmative.\r\nThe debate was closed by Mrs. Diggs,[269] and the resolution was\r\nadopted by 337 yeas, 269 nays--with a rider attached to it saying,\r\n\"but we do not regard this as a test of party fealty.\"\r\n\r\nThe Democratic women brought every possible influence to bear on the\r\nState convention of that party but it adopted the following\r\nresolution: \"We oppose woman suffrage as tending to destroy the home\r\nand family, the true basis of political safety, and express the hope\r\nthat the helpmeet and guardian of the family sanctuary may not be\r\ndragged from the modest purity of self-imposed seclusion to be thrown\r\nunwillingly into the unfeminine places of political strife.\"\r\n\r\nMiss Shaw continued canvassing the State for two months. Then Mrs.\r\nChapman Catt went out and remained until after election, making\r\naddresses, conferring with the politicians and counseling with the\r\nwomen. Miss Anthony, who was obliged to give most of the summer to the\r\ngreat campaign in progress in her own State of New York, returned to\r\nKansas October 20, and spoke daily on the Populist platform in the\r\nprincipal towns until election day, November 6, but only on the\r\nsuffrage plank. A large number of the ablest of the Kansas women made\r\nspeeches throughout the campaign and an army of them worked for the\r\namendment.[270]\r\n\r\nThe battle was lost, and the grief and disappointment of the Kansas\r\nwomen were indescribable. The amendment failed by 34,837 votes--95,302\r\nyeas, 130,139 nays. The total vote cast for Governor was 299,231;\r\ntotal vote on suffrage amendment, 225,441; not voting on amendment,\r\n73,790. There was an attempt to keep count of the ballots according to\r\nparties, but it was not entirely successful and there was no way of\r\ncorrectly estimating their political complexion. However, the vote for\r\nGov. E. N. Morrill (Rep.) lacked only 1,800 of that for the other\r\nthree candidates combined, which shows how easily the Republican party\r\nmight have carried the amendment. Subtracting the 5,000 Prohibition\r\nvotes, three-fourths of which it was conceded were cast for the\r\namendment, it lacked 27,000 of receiving as many votes as were cast\r\nfor the Populist candidate for Governor. Since some Republicans must\r\nhave voted for it, the figures prove that a vast number of Populists\r\ndid not do so.[271]\r\n\r\nThe first State convention following the defeat of 1894 was held at\r\nWinfield, December 6, 7, of that year. Mrs. Johns was once more\r\nelected president, but the profound disappointment over the defeat of\r\nthe amendment made it impossible to revive organization or interest to\r\nany satisfactory degree.\r\n\r\nFrom 1887 until 1895 Mrs. Johns was the efficient and devoted\r\npresident of the State association. As she declined to serve longer,\r\nthe convention which met at Eureka, November 21, 22, elected Mrs. Kate\r\nR. Addison to this office. Mrs. Addison began her official work with\r\nmuch hopefulness, established a monthly paper, the _Suffrage\r\nReveille_, and succeeded in enlisting new workers in the cause. Miss\r\nLaura A. Gregg, State organizer, added a number of clubs and over 200\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1896, Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Stetson was brought into the\r\nState for twenty-seven lectures, beginning with the Chautauqua\r\nAssembly at Winfield. The annual meeting took place at Topeka,\r\nNovember 10, ll, and Mrs. Addison was re-elected.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1897 was held at Yates Center, December 8-10, and\r\nMrs. Addison was continued in office. Mrs. Stetson had again made a\r\nlecturing tour of the State and a general revival of interest was\r\nreported.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony and Mrs. Chapman Catt were present at the State\r\nconvention in Paola, Oct. 21, 22, 1898. Mrs. Abbie A. Welch, a pioneer\r\nin the cause, was elected to the presidency. During this year Mrs.\r\nJohns and Miss Gregg organized a number of counties, and the press\r\nsuperintendent, Mrs. Alice G. Young, did effective work with the\r\nnewspapers.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1899 was held in Kansas City, October 9-11, and\r\nwas the most largely attended since the great defeat. Gov. John P. St.\r\nJohn was the orator of the occasion. The Rev. Father Kuhls, a Catholic\r\npriest, spoke as a disbeliever in woman's enfranchisement, which\r\nfurnished inspiration for a reply by Mrs. Diggs. This event created an\r\ninterest equalling the old-time enthusiasm, and it was believed that\r\nthe hour for renewed activity had struck. Mrs. Diggs was made\r\npresident, and it was unanimously resolved to take up again the work\r\nfor full enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1900 was held in Olathe, December 18, 19. The State\r\nat the recent Presidential election having gone strongly Republican,\r\nMrs. Diggs thought it not political wisdom to remain at the head of\r\nthe association and Miss Gregg was elected president. When it was\r\nlearned that she had taken charge of the Nebraska suffrage\r\nheadquarters her duties devolved upon Miss Helen L. Kimber, the new\r\nvice-president. This convention voted against the proposition to ask\r\nthe Legislature of 1901 to submit a constitutional amendment, thinking\r\nit advisable first to devote two years to the work of organization,\r\nafter which it is generally believed the full suffrage can be\r\nsecured.[272]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: The State Association from its beginning in 1884\r\nmade Municipal Suffrage its chief object. In 1885 a bill for this\r\npurpose was presented in the House by Frank J. Kelly. It was favorably\r\nreported by the Judiciary Committee, but although advanced somewhat on\r\nthe calendar it was too far down to reach a vote.\r\n\r\nAt a special session in 1886 the bill was reported to the House by the\r\ncommittee on Political Rights of Women, and a large force of competent\r\nwomen went to Topeka to urge its passage. On February 10 it stood\r\neighth from the top on the calendar. On February 11, when the\r\nCommittee on Revision submitted its report, it stood sixty-first. A\r\nstrong protest was made by its friends on the floor and by a standing\r\nvote it was restored to its original place. The enemies were now\r\nthoroughly alarmed. A State election was close at hand and the\r\nProhibitionists were crowding the Republicans. The bill was\r\npractically a Republican measure and its opponents in that party hit\r\nupon the scheme of getting up a Third Party scare. They were led by\r\nex-Gov. George T. Anthony who declared he would spend his last cent to\r\ndefeat the bill. It was denounced by press and politicians as a sly\r\nProhibition trick, some of its best friends were thus silenced and it\r\nwas quietly smothered. The bill was introduced in the Senate by L. B.\r\nKellogg and favorably reported from the Judiciary Committee with an\r\nopposing minority report. It was ably championed by himself, Senators\r\nH. B. Kelly and R. W. Blue, but was eventually stricken from the\r\ncalendar by the Committee on Revision and a motion to reinstate was\r\nlost by 12 yeas, 25 nays, on February 16.\r\n\r\nWhen the Legislature convened in 1887 the election was over and had\r\nresulted favorably for the Republicans. The suffragists had spent the\r\nintervening ten months in a campaign of their own. Miss Anthony had\r\ncome to Kansas and they had held conventions in all the principal\r\ncities. At her request the W. C. T. U. had given up their plan of\r\nasking for an amendment to the constitution and joined the attempt to\r\nsecure Municipal Suffrage under the leadership of their president,\r\nMrs. Fannie H. Rastall. Mrs. Zerelda G. Wallace, their national\r\nsuperintendent of franchise, gave a series of her eloquent lectures.\r\nThe strongest suffrage speakers in the country came to the State,\r\nunder the management of Mrs. Laura M. Johns, and petitions were\r\nsecured containing 10,000 names, more than ever had been presented for\r\nany purpose. This agitation was continued up to the opening of the\r\nLegislature, Jan. 11, 1887, when Mrs. Johns was on hand with the bill.\r\nIt was introduced in the Senate by Judge R. W. Blue and referred to\r\nthe Judiciary Committee, of which he was chairman. A favorable report,\r\nwith a minority dissent, was made, but the original bill had been\r\nsubstituted by one which provided merely that \"women should vote for\r\nall city officers.\" A vigorous protest was made by the suffrage\r\nleaders. They insisted that the right to vote for city bonds should be\r\nincluded, and that the inequalities should be remedied in the present\r\nlaw which prevented women of first and second class cities from voting\r\non school questions as did those of the third class and the country\r\ndistricts. A compromise was finally effected and a bill drafted by\r\nwhich women should vote for all city and school officers and on bonds\r\nfor school appropriations.\r\n\r\nA petition against the bill was sent in signed by nineteen women of\r\nIndependence, saying in effect that women had all the rights they\r\nneeded. On the morning when it was to be discussed an enormous bouquet\r\nadorned the desk of Senator R. M. Pickler, leader of the opponents,\r\nthe card inscribed, \"From the women of Kansas who do not wish to vote.\r\nHistory honors the man who dares to do what is right.\" Later\r\ninvestigation disclosed the fact that no woman had any part in sending\r\nthe flowers, but that, as one member remarked in open session, their\r\nchief perfume was that of alcohol.\r\n\r\nAfter hours of debate and an adjournment the bill finally was adopted\r\non January 28, by 25 yeas, all Republicans; 13 nays, 10 Republicans, 3\r\nDemocrats. Judge Blue's table was loaded with flowers and every\r\nSenator who voted in favor was decorated with a choice buttonhole\r\nbouquet sent by the ladies.\r\n\r\nThe bill was already far advanced in the House, under the management\r\nof Gen. T. T. Taylor. On February 10 the discussion continued the\r\nentire day. Scripture was read and Biblical authorities cited from Eve\r\nto St. Paul; the pure female angels were dragged through the filthy\r\ncesspool of politics, and the changes were rung on the usual hackneyed\r\nobjections. The measure was splendidly championed, however, by many\r\nmembers, especially by T. A. McNeal (Rep.) who made a telling response\r\nto the scurrilous speech of Edward Carrol (Dem.), leader of the\r\nopposition. No member of the House rendered more effective service\r\nthan did A. W. Smith, Speaker. It passed by 91 yeas--88 Rep., 3 Dem.;\r\n22 nays, 5 Rep., 17 Dem. The total vote of both Houses was 116\r\nyeas--113 Rep., 3 Dem.; 35 nays, 15 Rep., 20 Dem. The bill was signed\r\nby Gov. John A. Martin (Rep.), February 15, 1887.[273]\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding all the efficient work done by the officers of the\r\nState association, the local clubs and the platform speakers, this\r\nmeasure would not have become a law but for the vigilant work of the\r\nwomen with the Legislature itself. Mrs. Johns was on hand from the\r\nfirst, tactfully urging the bill. She had very material aid in the\r\nconstant presence, active pen and careful work of J. B. Johns, her\r\nhusband. Mrs. Helen M. Gougar of Indiana was granted the privilege of\r\naddressing the House while in session. Prominent women from all parts\r\nof the State were in attendance, using their influence with the\r\nmembers from their districts. On the day of final debate in the House\r\nthe floor and galleries were crowded, over 300 women being present. A\r\njubilee impossible to describe followed the announcement that the bill\r\nhad passed.[274] The next day the House was transformed by the women\r\ninto a bower of blossoms.\r\n\r\nIn March, the next month after Municipal Suffrage was granted to\r\nwomen, the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from ten to\r\neighteen years.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, in 1889, a bill was presented to amend this law,\r\nwhich passed the Senate by 26 yeas, 9 nays, and was sent to the House.\r\nIt was so smothered in words that the general public was not aware of\r\nits meaning. By the time it reached the House, however, the alarm had\r\nbeen sounded that it proposed to reduce the age of consent, and there\r\nwas a storm of protest. This was not alone from women but also from a\r\nnumber of men. The Labor Unions were especially active in opposition\r\nand the House was inundated with letters and petitions. The bill was\r\nreferred to the Judiciary Committee which reported it with the\r\nrecommendation that it be not passed. Its author claimed that it was\r\nintended simply to afford some protection for boys.[275] In 1891\r\nAttorney-General L. B. Kellogg recommended that, in order to protect\r\nyoung men of immature years from women of immoral life, inquiry as to\r\nthe character of the woman bringing the charge should be permitted.\r\nGov. Lyman U. Humphrey urged that such an amendment should be adopted,\r\nwhich could be done without lowering the age of protection for girls.\r\nNo change, however, has been made in the law.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the divorce law was so amended as to give the wife all the\r\nproperty owned by her at the time of marriage and all acquired by her\r\nafterward, alimony being allowed from the real and personal estate of\r\nthe husband.\r\n\r\nThis year a bill was passed creating the Girls' Industrial School.\r\nMrs. S. A. Thurston was one of the prime factors in securing this\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nAs the Legislature was overwhelmingly Republican the greatest effort\r\nwas put forth to secure a law making it mandatory to place women on\r\nthe State Boards of Charitable Institutions. Thirty-six large\r\npetitions were introduced by as many members in each House but all\r\nfailed of effect.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the Populist party gained control of the House of\r\nRepresentatives, although the Senate was still Republican. Mrs. Annie\r\nL. Diggs had been appointed by the Farmers' Alliance on their State\r\nlegislative committee and she began a vigorous campaign to secure Full\r\nSuffrage for Women by Statutory Enactment, which it was believed\r\ncould be done under the terms of the constitution. The bill was\r\nintroduced into the House and urged by J. L. Soupene. Mrs. Diggs had\r\nthe assistance of Col. Sam Wood and other ardent friends of suffrage.\r\nThe Committee on Political Rights of Women reported the bill\r\nfavorably, and said through its chairman, D. M. Watson:\r\n\r\n     While the constitution declares in the first section of its\r\n     suffrage article that \"every white male person, etc., shall be\r\n     deemed a qualified elector,\" in the second section it names\r\n     certain persons who shall be excluded from voting. Women are not\r\n     given the right to vote in the first nor are they excluded in the\r\n     second, and this indicates that the question of their right to\r\n     vote was intended to be left to the Legislature. The Supreme\r\n     Court (Wheeler vs. Brady, 15th Kas., p. 33,) says: \"There is\r\n     nothing in the nature of government which would prevent it. Women\r\n     are members of society, members of the great body politic,\r\n     citizens as much as men, with the same natural rights, united\r\n     with men in the same common destiny, and are capable of receiving\r\n     and exercising whatever political rights may be conferred upon\r\n     them.\"\r\n\r\nOn February 14 the bill received 60 yeas, 39 nays, not a\r\nconstitutional majority. The sentiment in favor was so strong among\r\nthe Populists that a reconsideration was finally secured and the bill\r\npassed by 69 yeas--64 Pop., 4 Rep., 1 Dem.; 32 nays--16 Pop., 12 Rep.,\r\n4 Dem. Previous to its passage the Speaker, P. P. Elder (Pop.)\r\npresented a protest signed by himself, 7 Populists, 4 Republicans and\r\n4 Democrats, declaring it to be unconstitutional and giving eight\r\nother objections.[276]\r\n\r\nThe friends were much elated at its passage over this protest and sent\r\nat once for Mrs. Johns to come to Topeka and work for its success in\r\nthe Senate. She made every possible effort but in vain, the\r\nRepublicans basing their refusal on its unconstitutionality. There was\r\nevery reason to believe the Supreme Court would have upheld the\r\nstatute.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 an amendment to the constitution was submitted to the electors\r\nby votes of both Republican and Populist members of the Legislature\r\nand was defeated in 1894, as has been related.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 two bills were introduced, one providing for a Bond Suffrage\r\nwhich is not included in the Municipal; the other to enable women to\r\nvote for Presidential electors. They were not reported from committee.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 a bill providing that there should be women physicians in\r\npenal institutions containing women and at least one woman on the\r\nState Board of Charities was favorably reported by, the House\r\ncommittee, but did not reach a vote.\r\n\r\nThis year an act was secured creating the Traveling Libraries\r\nCommission. The work for this was initiated and principally carried\r\nforward by Mrs. Lucy B. Johnston, who enlisted the women of the Social\r\nScience Federation in 1897. The federated club women had conducted the\r\nenterprise three years and now turned over to the State forty\r\nlibraries of about 5,000 volumes. In 1901 the appropriation was raised\r\nfrom $2,000 to $8,000.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 14, 1901, a bill prepared by Auditor Carlisle of Wyandotte\r\ncounty was introduced by its Representative J. A. Butler (Dem.) of\r\nKansas City, to repeal the law giving Municipal Suffrage to women. It\r\nwas received with jeers and shouts of laughter and referred to the\r\nJudiciary Committee, which, on the 17th, reported it with the\r\nrecommendation that it be not passed. On January 18 he re-introduced\r\nthe same measure under another title. This time protests were sent in\r\nfrom all parts of the State. Mrs. Diggs went to Mr. Butler's home and\r\nsecured a large number of these from his own constituents. A hearing\r\nwas given by the Judiciary Committee to a delegation of prominent\r\nwomen and the bill was never reported.\r\n\r\nAs there seemed so much favorable sentiment it was hastily decided to\r\nask this Legislature to give women the right to vote for Presidential\r\nelectors, which would unquestionably be legal. Mrs. Johns and Miss\r\nHelen Kimber looked after its interests with the Republican members;\r\nMrs. Diggs with the Populists. The evening of February 26, when the\r\nvote was to be taken in the Senate, floor and galleries were crowded\r\nwith women of position and influence. Senator Fred Dumont Smith (Rep.)\r\nhad charge of the bill, and Senator G. A. Noftzger (Rep.) led the\r\nopposition. The vote resulted in 22 yeas--16 Rep., 4 Pop., 2 Dem.; 13\r\nnays--12 Rep., 1 Pop. The friends had every reason to believe the\r\nHouse would pass the bill, but in the still small hours of the night\r\nfollowing the action of the Senate, its Republican members in caucus\r\ndecided that this might injure the party at the approaching State\r\nelection, and the next morning it was reconsidered and defeated by 14\r\nyeas--9 Rep., 4 Pop., 1 Dem.; 23 nays--21 Rep., 1 Pop., 1 Dem.\r\n\r\nLAWS: The constitution of Kansas, adopted in 1859, contained more\r\nliberal provisions for women than had existed in any State up to that\r\ntime. It made the law of inheritance the same for widow and widower;\r\ngave father and mother equal guardianship of children; and directed\r\nthe Legislature to protect married women in the possession of separate\r\nproperty. This was not done, however, until 1868, the next year after\r\nthe first campaign to secure an amendment conferring suffrage upon\r\nwomen. At this time a statute provided that all property, real and\r\npersonal, owned by a woman at marriage, and all acquired thereafter by\r\ndescent or by the gift of any person except her husband, shall remain\r\nher sole and separate property, not subject to the disposal of her\r\nhusband or liable for his debts.\r\n\r\nA married woman may make contracts, sue and be sued as if unmarried;\r\nengage in any business or perform any services and her earnings shall\r\nbe her sole and separate property to be used or invested by her. The\r\nwife can convey or mortgage her separate personal property without the\r\nhusband's signature. He can do the same without her signature except\r\nsuch as is exempt so long as a man is married. Neither can convey or\r\nencumber real estate without consent of the other.\r\n\r\nIf there are no children the surviving husband or wife takes all the\r\nproperty real and personal; if there are children, one-half. Neither\r\ncan dispose by will of more than one-half of the separate property\r\nwithout the consent of the other. A homestead of 160 acres of land, or\r\none acre within city limits, is reserved free from creditors for the\r\nsurvivor. If the wife marry again, or when the children have attained\r\ntheir majority, the homestead must be divided, she taking one-half. If\r\nshe die first the husband has the right of occupancy for life, whether\r\nhe marry or not, but the homestead must descend to her heirs.\r\n\r\nThe husband must support the wife according to his means, or she may\r\nhave alimony decreed by the court without divorce, or in some cases\r\nshe may sue directly for support. In case of divorce the wife is\r\nentitled to all the property owned by her at marriage and all acquired\r\nby her afterwards, alimony being allowed from the real and personal\r\nestate of the husband.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls is 18, with penalty of imprisonment\r\nat hard labor not less than five nor more than twenty-one years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: (See page 659.)\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: The first State constitution, in 1859, declared women\r\neligible for all School offices. As it does not require that any State\r\nofficer except member of the Legislature shall be an elector, women\r\nare not legally debarred from any other State office. The constitution\r\ndoes prescribe the qualifications for some county officers, and the\r\nLegislature for others and for all township officers. Some of these\r\nare required to be electors and some are not; some can be voted for\r\nonly by electors and the law is silent in regard to others. It would\r\nperhaps require a Supreme Court decision in almost every case if there\r\nwere any general disposition to elect women to these offices. Twenty\r\nyears ago a few were serving as county clerks, registers of deeds,\r\nregents of the State University, county superintendents and school\r\ntrustees.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Attorney-General L. B. Kellogg (Rep.) appointed his wife\r\nAssistant Attorney-General. She was a practicing attorney and her\r\nhusband's law partner and filled the office with great ability. Miss\r\nElla Cameron served out her father's unexpired term as Probate Judge\r\nand the Legislature legalized her acts.\r\n\r\nThere is no law requiring women on the boards of State institutions\r\nbut a number have been appointed. Gov. L. D. Lewelling (Pop.) in 1893\r\nappointed Mrs. Mary E. Lease member of the State Board of Charities\r\nand Mrs. Eva Blackman on the Board of Police Commissioners of\r\nLeavenworth. These were the first and last appointments of women to\r\nthese positions.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 women physicians were appointed by him in two insane asylums,\r\nthe Orphans' Home and the Girls' Industrial School.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Gov. John W. Leedy (Pop.) appointed Mrs. John P. St. John\r\nmember Board of Regents of State Agricultural College and Dr. Eva\r\nHarding physician at Boys' Reform School.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Mrs. Annie L. Diggs was appointed State Librarian by the\r\nSupreme Court, Judges Frank Doster, Stephen Allen, Populists; William\r\nA. Johnston, Republican. The term is four years. There are two women\r\nassistants in the State library.\r\n\r\nMiss Zu Adams is first assistant in the State Historical Library.\r\nThree other women are employed as assistants in that office.\r\n\r\nEach of the three State Hospitals for the Insane has a woman\r\nphysician, but this is not required. The law provides that the Girls'\r\nIndustrial School shall have a woman physician and superintendent. Its\r\nofficers always have been women, except the farmer and engineer. In\r\n1894 a woman was appointed as farmer and was said to be the best the\r\ninstitution ever had.\r\n\r\nMrs. Lucy B. Johnston and Mrs. Mary V. Humphreys are members of the\r\nState Traveling Library Commission, Mrs. Diggs, as State Librarian,\r\nbeing president.\r\n\r\nSince the very first time that women voted they have been clerks of\r\nelections, and in some instances, judges.\r\n\r\nSeveral small towns have put the entire local government into the\r\nhands of women. From 1887 to 1894 there had been about fifty women\r\naldermen, five police judges, one city attorney, several city clerks\r\nand treasurers, and numerous clerks and treasurers of school boards.\r\nIn 1896 a report from about half the counties showed twenty women\r\ncounty superintendents of schools, and 554 serving on school boards.\r\nThey are frequently made president or secretary of the board.\r\n\r\nWomen have been candidates for State Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction, but none has been elected.\r\n\r\nA number of women within the past few years have been elected county\r\ntreasurers, recorders, registers and clerks. They serve as notaries\r\npublic. Probably one-third of the county offices have women deputies.\r\n\r\nThe record for 1900, as far as it could be obtained, showed the women\r\nin office to be one clerk of the district court, two county clerks,\r\nseven registrars of deeds and twenty-seven county superintendents of\r\nschools. This list is far from complete.\r\n\r\nAbout twenty-five women have been elected to the office of mayor in\r\nthe smaller towns of Kansas. In several instances the entire board of\r\naldermen have been women. The business record of these women has been\r\ninvariably good and their industrious efforts to improve sanitation,\r\nschools, sidewalks, and to advance the other interests of their town,\r\nhave been generously seconded and aided by the men of their community.\r\nAmong the most prominent of the women mayors were Mrs. Mary D. Lowman\r\nof Oskaloosa, Mrs. Minnie D. Morgan of Cottonwood Falls, and Mrs.\r\nAntoinette Haskell of Gaylord. Mrs. Lowman, the second woman to be\r\nelected, conducted a great work in improving the conditions of the\r\nmunicipality, morally and physically. She held her office two terms\r\nwith entire boards of women aldermen, and refused to serve a third\r\nterm, saying that she and her boards had accomplished the work they\r\nset out to do. They retired with much honor and esteem, having made a\r\ncreditable amount of street improvements and left the treasury with\r\nmore money than they found in it. Mrs. Morgan is editor with her\r\nhusband of a Republican newspaper, an officer in the Woman's State\r\nPress Association and holds high official position in the Woman's\r\nRelief Corps. Mrs. Haskell is the wife of a prominent lawyer and\r\npolitician. She held the office of mayor for two terms and the last\r\ntime her entire board of aldermen were women. Her administration of\r\nmunicipal affairs was so satisfactory that she was besought to accept\r\na third term but declined.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: The constitution of the State, framed in 1859, opened\r\nevery occupation to women.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: This first constitution also required the admission of\r\nwomen to all the State educational institutions and gave them a place\r\non the faculties. As early as 1882 one-half of the faculty of the\r\nState University was composed of women. This university, the State\r\nAgricultural College and the State Normal College average an equal\r\nnumber of men and women graduates. Women hold places on the faculties\r\nof all these institutions.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 5,380 men and 7,133 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $39; of the women, $32.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: The constitution for Statehood, framed in 1859, provided\r\nthat all women over 21 should vote at all School District meetings the\r\nsame as men, the first one to contain such a provision. This excluded\r\nall women in first and second class cities in after years, as their\r\nschool affairs are not managed through district meetings. When a test\r\ncase was made it was decided by the Supreme Court that no women could\r\nlegally vote for State or county superintendents, but only for\r\ntrustees. (5th Kansas, p. 227.) Both the constitution and the statutes\r\nare confused as to the qualifications of those who may vote for\r\nvarious county and township officers but women never have been\r\npermitted to do so.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the Legislature granted Municipal Suffrage to women. The law\r\nis as follows:\r\n\r\n     In any election hereafter held in any city of the first, second\r\n     or third class, for the election of city or school officers, or\r\n     for the purpose of authorizing the issuance of any bonds for\r\n     school purposes, the right of any citizen to vote shall not be\r\n     denied or abridged on account of sex; and women may vote at such\r\n     elections the same as men, under like restrictions and\r\n     qualifications; and any women possessing the qualifications of a\r\n     voter under this act shall also be eligible to any such city or\r\n     school office.\r\n\r\nThis law includes women in all of the villages, as these are known as\r\n\"third class cities.\" Women in country districts, however, continue to\r\nhave only a limited School Suffrage. It does not give women a vote on\r\nany questions of taxation which are submitted to the electors except\r\nfor school purposes.\r\n\r\nNevertheless this was an advanced step which attracted the attention\r\nof the entire country. While in Wyoming women had Full Suffrage, it\r\nwas a sparsely settled Territory, with few newspapers and far removed\r\nfrom centers of political activity. Kansas was a battle-ground for\r\npolitics, and great interest was felt in the new forces which had been\r\ncalled into action. From the first women very extensively took\r\nadvantage of their new privilege. It was granted February 15 and the\r\nnext municipal election took place April 5, so there were only a few\r\nweeks in which to accustom them to the new idea, make them acquainted\r\nwith the issues, settle the disputed points and give them a chance to\r\nregister. The question was at once raised whether they could vote for\r\njustices of the peace and constables, and at a late hour\r\nAttorney-General S. B. Bradford gave his opinion that they could not\r\ndo so, as these are township officers. This made separate ballot-boxes\r\nnecessary and in many places these were not provided, so there was\r\nconsiderable misunderstanding and confusion. On election day a wind\r\nstorm of unusual violence, even for that section of the country, raged\r\nall day. Through the influence of the Liquor Dealers' Association,\r\nwhich had used every possible effort to defeat the suffrage bill,\r\nreporters were sent by a number of large papers in different cities,\r\nespecially St. Louis, with orders to ridicule the voting of the women\r\nand minimize its effects. As a result the Eastern press was soon\r\nflooded with sensational and false reports.\r\n\r\nAn official and carefully prepared report of 112 pages was issued by\r\nJudge Francis G. Adams, secretary of the Kansas State Historical\r\nAssociation, and Prof. William H. Carruth of the State University,\r\ngiving the official returns from 253 cities. The total vote was\r\n105,216; vote of men, 76,629; of women, 28,587. In a few of the very\r\nsmall cities there were no women's votes. In many of the second-class\r\ncities more than one-half as many women as men voted. In Leavenworth,\r\n3,967 ballots were cast by men, and 2,467 by women; in Lawrence, 1,437\r\nby men, 1,050 by women. In Kansas City, Topeka and Fort Scott about\r\none-fourth as many women as men voted. In these estimates it must be\r\ntaken into consideration that there were many more men than women in\r\nthe State. In 1890, three years later, the census report showed the\r\nexcess of males to be about 100,000.\r\n\r\nThe pamphlet referred to contained 100 pages of extracts from the\r\npress of Kansas on the voting of women, and stated that these\r\nrepresented but a fraction of the comment. They varied as much as the\r\nindividual opinions of men, some welcoming the new voters, some\r\nridiculing and abusing, others referring to the movement as a foolish\r\nfad which would soon be dropped. The Republican and Prohibitionist\r\npapers almost universally paid the highest tribute to the influence of\r\nwomen on the election and assured them of every possible support in\r\nthe future. The Democratic papers, with but few exceptions, scoffed at\r\nthem and condemned woman suffrage. The immense majority of opinion was\r\nin favor of the new regime and was an unimpeachable answer to the\r\nobjections and misrepresentations which found place in the press of\r\nall other parts of the country.\r\n\r\nThe interest of Kansas women in their political rights never has\r\nabated. The proportion of their vote varies in about the same ratio as\r\nthat of men. Upon occasions when the character of candidates or the\r\nimportance of the issue commands especial attention a great many go to\r\nthe polls. Their chief interest, however, centers in questions which\r\nbear directly upon the education and welfare of their children, the\r\nenvironment of their homes and those of kindred nature. When issues\r\ninvolving these are presented they vote in large numbers.\r\n\r\nThere is always a larger municipal vote in the uneven years when\r\nmayors are to be elected, and therefore a comparison is made in five\r\nprominent cities between the vote of 1887 and that of 1901 to show\r\nthat in the fourteen years the interest of women in the suffrage has\r\nincreased instead of diminished.\r\n\r\n  _Town._        _Year._     _Man-Vote._     _Woman-Vote._\r\n  Kansas City     1887       3,956          1,042\r\n  Kansas City     1901       8,900          4,582\r\n  Topeka          1887       4,580          1,049\r\n  Topeka          1901       7,338          5,335\r\n  Fort Scott      1887       1,273            425\r\n  Fort Scott      1901       1,969          1,270\r\n  Leavenworth     1887       3,967          2,467\r\n  Leavenworth     1901       5,590          3,018\r\n  Wichita         1887       3,312          2,984\r\n  Wichita         1901       .....          .....\r\n\r\nIt was impossible to obtain the vote of Wichita in 1901 but the\r\nregistration was 6,546 men, 4,040 women, and out of these 10,586,\r\nthere were 8,960 who voted. One of the most prominent lawyers in\r\nWichita writes of this election: \"The women fully maintained the ratio\r\nof the registration. The vote was small on account of inclement\r\nweather but I am sure that it kept away more men than women.\"\r\n\r\nAt one election it is recorded the vote of women exceeded that of men\r\nin one second-class and three third-class cities. In one instance all\r\nbut two of the women of Cimarron cast their ballots. In Lincoln for\r\nseveral years women have polled 46 per cent. of the entire vote. The\r\npercentage of males in the State by the census of 1900 was 52.3.\r\n\r\nThe question frequently is asked why, with the ballot in their hands,\r\nwomen do not compel the enforcement of the prohibitory law, as it is\r\ngenerally supposed that Municipal Suffrage carries with it the right\r\nto vote for all city officials. The same year that women were\r\nenfranchised, the Legislature, for whom women do not vote, passed a\r\nlaw authorizing the Governor, for whom women do not vote, to appoint a\r\nBoard of Police Commissioners for each city of the first class, with\r\npower to appoint the police judge, city marshal and police, and have\r\nabsolute control of the organization, government and discipline of the\r\npolice force and of all station-houses, city prisons, etc. Temperance\r\nmen and women strongly urged this measure as they believed the\r\nGovernor would have stamina enough to select commissioners who would\r\nenforce the prohibitory law. This board was abolished at the special\r\nsession of the Legislature in 1897, as it was made a scapegoat for\r\ncity and county officers who were too cowardly or too unfriendly to\r\nenforce the liquor ordinances, and it did not effect the hoped-for\r\nreforms.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 City Courts were established. By uniting the townships with\r\ncities and giving these courts jurisdiction over State and county\r\ncases, to relieve the congested condition of State courts, women are\r\ndeprived of a vote for their officers. The exercise of the Municipal\r\nFranchise at present is as follows:\r\n\r\n  MEN VOTE FOR                            WOMEN VOTE FOR\r\n  Mayor,                                  Mayor,\r\n  Councilmen,                             Councilmen,\r\n  School Board,                           School Board,\r\n  City Attorney,                          City Attorney,\r\n  City Treasurer,                         City Treasurer,\r\n  City Clerk,                             City Clerk.\r\n  Judge of City Court,\r\n  Clerk of City Court,                    APPOINTED BY MAYOR\r\n  Marshal of City Court,                  Police Judge,\r\n  Two Justices of the Peace,              City Marshal,\r\n  Two Constables.                         Chief of Police.\r\n\r\nIn cities of less than 30,000 the Police Judge is elected and women\r\nmay vote for this officer. In the smallest places the City Marshal is\r\nalso Chief of Police.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen that even for the Police Court in the largest cities\r\nwomen have only an indirect vote through the Mayor's appointments. In\r\nall the cities and towns liquor sellers when convicted here simply\r\ntake an appeal to a higher court over which women have no\r\njurisdiction. They have no vote for sheriff, county attorney or any\r\ncounty officer. These facts may in a measure answer the question why\r\nwomen are helpless to enforce the prohibitory law or any other to\r\nwhich they are opposed.\r\n\r\nNevertheless even this small amount of suffrage has been of much\r\nbenefit to the women and to the cities. As the years go by the general\r\naverage of the woman-vote is larger. Municipal voting has developed a\r\nstronger sense of civic responsibility among women; it has completely\r\ndemolished the old stock objections and has familiarized men with the\r\npresence of women at the polls. Without question a higher level in the\r\nconduct of city affairs has resulted. It may, however, well be\r\nquestioned as to whether Municipal Suffrage has not militated against\r\nthe full enfranchisement of women. Politicians have been annoyed by\r\ninterference with their schemes. Men have learned that women command\r\ninfluence in politics, and the party machine has become hostile to\r\nfurther extension of woman's opportunity and power to demand cleaner\r\nmorals and nobler standards.[277]\r\n\r\nJudge S. S. King, Commissioner of Elections at Kansas City, has given\r\nthe suffrage question much thought, and he has gleaned from the\r\nfigures of his official records some interesting facts. Alluding to\r\nthe mooted question of what class of women vote he says:\r\n\r\n     The opponents of woman suffrage insist that the lower classes\r\n     freely exercise the franchise, while the higher classes generally\r\n     refrain from voting. As women in registering usually give their\r\n     vocation as \"housekeeper\" it is impossible to learn from that\r\n     record what particular ledge of the social strata they stand\r\n     upon, therefore, in order to locate them as to trades, business,\r\n     etc., I give them the positions occupied by their husbands and\r\n     fathers. I take the 17th voting precinct of Kansas City as a\r\n     typical one. It is about an average in voting population of white\r\n     and colored men and women and in the diversified industries. The\r\n     149 white women who registered in this precinct, as indicated by\r\n     the vocations of their husbands, fathers, etc., would be\r\n     classified thus:\r\n\r\n     The trades (all classes of skilled labor), 32; the professions,\r\n     26; merchants (all manner of dealers), 16; laborers (unskilled),\r\n     15; clerks, 10; public officers, 8; bankers and brokers, 7;\r\n     railroad employes, 7; salesmen, 5; contractors, 2; foremen, 2;\r\n     paymaster, 1; unclassified, 16. Thus, if the opponents of woman\r\n     suffrage use the term \"lower classes\" according to some\r\n     ill-defined rule of élite society, the example given above would\r\n     be a complete refutation. If by \"lower classes\" they mean the\r\n     immoral and dissolute, the refutation appears to be still more\r\n     complete, for the woman electorate in the 17th precinct is\r\n     particularly free from those elements.\r\n\r\nIt is extremely rare to find a prominent man in Kansas, except certain\r\npoliticians, who openly opposes woman suffrage. With a very few\r\nexceptions the most eminent cordially advocate it, including a large\r\nnumber of ministers, lawyers and editors. It would require a chapter\r\nsimply to catalogue the names of well-known men and women who are\r\nheartily in favor of it. Had Kansas men voted their convictions,\r\nKansas women would long since have been enfranchised, but political\r\npartisanship has been stronger than the sense of justice.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[263] The History is indebted for this chapter principally to Mrs.\r\nAnnie L.

It was\r\nafterwards adopted by the National Association in recognition of\r\nKansas, then the most progressive State in regard to women. Those of a\r\nclassical bent accepted it because yellow among the ancients signified\r\nwisdom.\r\n\r\n[267] Secretary, May Belleville Brown; treasurer, Elizabeth F.\r\nHopkins; Mrs. S. A.

At one point she said: 'The great\r\nmajority of you declare that woman suffrage is right, (a roar of\r\n'yes,' 'yes,' went up), and yet you oppose this plank. Are you afraid\r\nto do right?' Her reply to the flimsy objections of the chairman, P.\r\nP. Elder, was simply unanswerable. She cut the ground from under his\r\nfeet, and his confusion and rout were so complete that he stood\r\nutterly confounded. That small woman with her truth and eloquence had\r\nslain the Goliath of the opposition!\"\r\n\r\n[270] The following speakers and organizers were placed at fairs,\r\nChautauqua assemblies, picnics, teachers' institutes and in\r\ndistinctive suffrage meetings: James Clement Ambrose (Ills.), Theresa\r\nJenkins (Wyo.), Elizabeth Upham Yates (Me.), Clara C.

These returns were carefully\r\ntabulated by Mrs. Thurston, acting secretary of the amendment campaign\r\ncommittee. The result showed that of Republicans _voting on the\r\nproposition_, 38-1/2 per cent. voted _for_; of Populists, 54 per\r\ncent.; of Democrats, 14 per cent.; of Prohibitionists, 88 per cent.\r\n\r\nOf the entire vote of the Republican party for its ticket, 22 per\r\ncent. were silent on the amendment; of the entire vote of the People's\r\nparty, 22 per cent.; of the Democratic, 28 per cent.; of the\r\nProhibition, 24 per cent.\r\n\r\n[272] Others who have held official position are vice-presidents,\r\nMesdames J.K.

Hawley.\r\n\r\n[273] Miss Susan B. Anthony was in the National Convention at\r\nWashington and this news was telegraphed her as a birthday greeting.\r\n\r\n[274] Among the most influential workers for this bill during the\r\nthree sessions of the Legislature, in addition to those mentioned,\r\nwere Thomas L. Bond; Mesdames Bertha H. Ellsworth, Hetta P. Mansfield,\r\nMartia L. Berry, S. A. Thurston and Henrietta B. Wall; Misses Jennie\r\nNewby, Olive P. Bray and Amanda Way.\r\n\r\n[275] Mrs. Johns says of this occasion: \"If we had ever had any doubt\r\nthat even our small moiety of the suffrage would strengthen our\r\ninfluence for righteousness, the effect of our protest at this time\r\nand the attitude of the politicians toward us would have dispelled\r\nthat doubt. We felt our power and it was a new thrill which we\r\nexperienced.\"\r\n\r\n[276] Among these were the following:\r\n\r\nThe relations of man and wife \"are one and inseparable\" as to the good\r\nto be derived from or the evil to be suffered by laws imposed, and the\r\naddition of woman suffrage will not better their condition, but is\r\nfraught with danger and evil to both sexes and the well-being of\r\nsociety.\r\n\r\nThis privilege conferred will bring to every primary, caucus and\r\nelection--to our jury rooms, the bench and the Legislature--the\r\nambitious and designing women only, to engage in all the tricks,\r\nintrigues and cunning incident to corrupt political campaigns, only to\r\nlower the moral standing of their sex; it invites and creates\r\njealousies and scandals and jeopardizes their high moral standing;\r\nhurls women out from their central orb fixed by their Creator to an\r\nexternal place in the order of things. Promiscuous mingling with the\r\nrude and unscrupulous element around earnest and exciting elections\r\ntends to a familiarity that breeds contempt for the fair sex deeply to\r\nbe deplored.\r\n\r\nThe demand for female suffrage is largely confined to the ambitious\r\noffice-seeking class, possessing an insatiable desire for the forum,\r\nand when allowed will unfit this class for all the duties of domestic\r\nlife and transform them into politicians, and dangerous ones at that.\r\n\r\nWhen the laws of nature shall so change the female organization as to\r\nmake it possible for them to sing \"bass\" we shall then be quite\r\nwilling for such a bill to become a law.\r\n\r\nIt is a grave mistake, an injury to both sexes and the party, to add\r\nanother \"ism\" to our political creed.\r\n\r\n  Republican--A.

Morris,\r\n  Levi Dumbauld, C. W. Dickson, Geo. E. Smith of Neosho.\r\n\r\n[277] In 1901, in Topeka, a candidate for the mayoralty, supposed to\r\nrepresent the liquor element, speaking on the afternoon of election\r\nday--bleak, dismal and shoe-top deep in snow and mud--said: \"I will\r\nlose 1,000 votes on account of the weather as the women are out and\r\nthey are opposed to me. It is impossible to keep them from voting.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLI.\r\n\r\nKENTUCKY.[278]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn October, 1886, the Association for the Advancement of Women held\r\nits annual congress in Louisville, and for the first time woman\r\nsuffrage was admitted to a place on the program. It was advocated by\r\nMrs. Ednah D. Cheney of Massachusetts and Miss Laura Clay.\r\n\r\nThe subject was much discussed for the next two years and in February,\r\n1888, Mrs. Mary B. Clay, vice-president of the American and of the\r\nNational Woman Suffrage Associations, called a convention in\r\nFrankfort. Delegates from Lexington and Richmond attended, and Mrs.\r\nZerelda G. Wallace of Indiana was present by invitation. The Hall of\r\nRepresentatives was granted for two evenings, the General Assembly\r\nbeing in session. On the first Mrs. Wallace delivered an able address\r\nand the hall was well filled, principally with members of the\r\nLegislature. On the second Mrs. Clay spoke upon the harsh laws in\r\nregard to women, and Prof. E. B. Walker on the injustice of the\r\nproperty laws and the advantage of giving women the ballot in\r\nmunicipal affairs. He was followed by Mrs. Sarah Clay Bennett, who\r\nargued that women already had a right to the ballot under the\r\nFourteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution. At the\r\nconclusion of her address she asked all legislators present who were\r\nwilling to give the ballot to women to stand. Seven arose and were\r\ngreeted with loud applause.\r\n\r\nWhen the annual meeting of the American W. S. A. convened in\r\nCincinnati, Ohio, Nov. 20-22, 1888, Miss Laura Clay, member of its\r\nexecutive committee from Kentucky, issued a call to the suffragists of\r\nthat State to attend this convention for the purpose of organizing a\r\nState association. Accordingly delegates from the Fayette and Kenton\r\ncounty societies met and organized the Kentucky Equal Rights\r\nAssociation. The following officers were elected: President, Miss\r\nClay; vice-presidents, Mrs. Ellen Battelle Dietrick, Mrs. Mary B.\r\nClay; corresponding secretary, Mrs. Eugenia B. Farmer; recording\r\nsecretary, Miss Anna M. Deane; treasurer, Mrs. Isabella H. Shepard.\r\n\r\nThe second annual convention was held in the court house at Lexington,\r\nNov. 19-21, 1889, with officers and delegates representing seven\r\ncounties. The evening speakers were Mrs. Clay, Mrs. Josephine K. Henry\r\nand Joseph B. Cottrell, D. D. A committee was appointed, Mrs. Henry,\r\nchairman, to present the interests of women to the approaching General\r\nAssembly and the Constitutional Convention. (See Legislative Action\r\nfor 1890.)\r\n\r\nThe next annual meeting took place in Richmond, Dec. 3, 4, 1890. Mrs.\r\nSarah Hardin Sawyer was asked to prepare a tract on co-education,\r\nwhich proved of great assistance in opening the colleges to women. The\r\nevening speakers were Mrs. Shepard, Mrs. Henry and the Rev. John G.\r\nFee, the venerable Kentucky Abolitionist.\r\n\r\nThe fourth convention was held in Louisville, Dec. 8-10, 1891, and was\r\naddressed by the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw and the Rev. Dr. C. K. J.\r\nJones.\r\n\r\nThe fifth annual meeting convened in Richmond, Nov. 9, 10, 1892.[279]\r\nMrs. Lida Calvert Obenchain's paper, \"Why a Democratic Woman Wants the\r\nBallot,\" was afterwards widely circulated as a leaflet. The evening\r\nspeakers were Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby of Washington, D. C., and Dr. J.\r\nFranklin Browne.\r\n\r\nThe General Assembly of 1892 was in session most of that year and some\r\nmonths in 1893, as there was a vast amount of business to be done in\r\nbringing all departments of legislation into harmony with the new\r\nconstitution. During all this time the State association was busy\r\nurging the rights of women; and at its sixth convention, held in\r\nNewport, Oct. 17-19, 1893, was able to report that a law had been\r\nsecured granting a married woman the power to make a will and control\r\nher separate property. Among the speakers was the Rev. G. W.\r\nBradford.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting took place in Lexington, Oct. 24-26, 1894. The most\r\nencouraging successes of any year were reported in the extension of\r\nSchool Suffrage and the passage of the Married Woman's Property Rights\r\nBill. In answer to the petition of the Fayette County society to Mayor\r\nHenry T. Duncan and the city council of Lexington to place a woman on\r\nthe school board, Mrs. Wilbur R. Smith had been appointed. She was the\r\nfirst to hold such a position in Kentucky. Mrs. Farmer gave an address\r\non School Suffrage, with illustrations of registration and voting,\r\nwhich women were to have an opportunity to apply in 1895.[280]\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Richmond was again selected as the place for the State\r\nconvention, December 10-12, at which legislative work in the General\r\nAssembly of 1896 was carefully planned. (See Legislative Action.)\r\n\r\nThe convention met in Lexington, Dec. 18, 1896. A committee was\r\nappointed to work for complete School Suffrage in the extra session of\r\nthe General Assembly the next year.[281]\r\n\r\nCovington entertained the annual meeting Oct. 14, 15, 1897. Mrs. Emma\r\nSmith DeVoe of Illinois, a national organizer, was present, being then\r\nengaged in a tour through the State. This convention was unusually\r\nlarge and full of encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe eleventh convention was held in Richmond, Dec. 1, 1898, and the\r\ntwelfth in Lexington, Dec. 11, 12, 1899. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt,\r\nchairman of the national organization committee, and Miss Mary G. Hay,\r\nsecretary, assisted, the former giving addresses both evenings. It was\r\ndecided to ask the General Assembly to make an appropriation for the\r\nestablishment of a dormitory for the women students of the State\r\nCollege.\r\n\r\nMiss Laura Clay has been president of the State Association since it\r\nwas organized in 1888. Mrs. Ellen Battelle Dietrick was the first\r\nvice-president, but removing to Massachusetts the following year, Mrs.\r\nMary Barr Clay, the second vice-president, was elected and has\r\ncontinued in that office. There have been but two other second\r\nvice-presidents, the Hon. William Randall Ramsey and Mrs. Mary C.\r\nCramer, and but two corresponding secretaries, Mrs. Eugenia B. Farmer\r\nand Mrs. Mary C. Roark. The office of treasurer has been filled\r\ncontinuously by Mrs. Isabella H. Shepard.[282] During all these years\r\nH. H. Gratz, editor of the Lexington _Gazette_, and John W. Sawyer,\r\neditor of the _Southern Journal_, have been among the most faithful\r\nand courageous friends of woman suffrage. The Prohibition papers,\r\nalmost without exception, have been cordial.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: During the General Assembly of 1890, a\r\ncommittee of eight from the E. R. A. went to Frankfort to ask\r\nlegislation on the property rights of women, and for women physicians\r\nin the State asylums for the insane. A petition for property rights\r\nwas presented, signed with 9,000 names. Of these 2,240 were collected\r\nby Mrs. S. M. Hubbard. On January 10 appeals were made in\r\nRepresentatives' Hall by Miss Laura Clay for the Women Physicians\r\nBill, and by Mrs. Josephine K. Henry for the Property Rights Bill. The\r\nlatter had carefully prepared a compendium of the married women's\r\nproperty laws in all the States, which was of incalculable value\r\nthroughout the years of labor necessary to secure this bill.\r\n\r\nThe press of the State, with few exceptions, espoused the cause of\r\nproperty rights for women. Seven bills were presented to this General\r\nAssembly, among them one drawn and introduced into the Senate by Judge\r\nWilliam Lindsay, afterward United States Senator. This secured to\r\nmarried women the enjoyment of their property, gave them the power to\r\nmake a will and equalized curtesy and dower. Although reported\r\nadversely by the committee, it was taken up for discussion and was\r\neloquently defended by Judge Lindsay. It passed the Senate, but, was\r\ndefeated in the House by the opposing members withdrawing and\r\nbreaking the quorum.[283] A bill introduced by the Hon. William B.\r\nSmith, making it obligatory upon employers to pay wages earned by\r\nmarried women to themselves and not their husbands, became a law at\r\nthis session.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Convention held in 1890-91 was the field of much\r\nlabor by the State association. In October a committee consisting of\r\nMrs. Henry, Miss Clay, Mrs. Eugenia B. Farmer, Mrs. Isabella H.\r\nShepard and Mrs. Sarah Clay Bennett went to Frankfort to appeal for\r\nclauses in the new constitution empowering the General Assembly to\r\nextend Full Suffrage to women; to secure the property rights of wives;\r\nand to grant School Suffrage to all women. The importance of their\r\nclaims was so impressed upon the convention that it appointed a\r\nspecial Committee on Woman's Rights, with one of its most esteemed\r\nmembers, the Hon. Jep. C. Jonson, as chairman, who did all in his\r\npower to bring their cause favorably before this body.\r\n\r\nOn the evening of October 9, in Representatives' Hall, Miss Clay, Mrs.\r\nShepard and Mrs. Bennett addressed an audience composed largely of\r\nmembers, being introduced by Mr. Jonson. Later, Mrs. Henry was given a\r\nhearing before the committee. Her tract appealing for property rights\r\nwas read before the convention by Mr. Jonson and supplied to each of\r\nthe 100 members. In addition she supplied them several times a week\r\nwith leaflets, congressional hearings, etc., and wrote 200 articles\r\nfor the press on property rights and thirty-one on suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe five ladies, with Mrs. Sarah Hardin Sawyer and Mrs. Margaret A.\r\nWatts, met in Frankfort again on December 8, and obtained hearings\r\nbefore the Committees on Revision of the Constitution, Education and\r\nWoman's Rights. Mrs. Henry also addressed the Committee on Elections,\r\nwho asked that her speech be printed and furnished to each member of\r\nthe convention.\r\n\r\nOn December 12 the Hon. W. H. Mackoy, at the request of the\r\nsuffragists, offered this amendment to the section on elections: \"The\r\nGeneral Assembly may hereafter extend full or partial suffrage to\r\nfemale citizens of the United States of the age of 21 years, who have\r\nresided in this State one year, etc.\" By his motion the ladies\r\nappeared before the convention in Committee of the Whole. They\r\nselected Miss Clay as their spokesman and sat in front of the\r\nspeaker's stand during her address.\r\n\r\nThe only clause finally obtained in the new constitution was one\r\npermitting the General Assembly to extend School Suffrage to women;\r\nbut the Legislature of 1892 made important concessions.\r\n\r\nAmong the members of the General Assembly of 1894 especial gratitude\r\nis due to Judges S. B. Vance and W. H. Beckner. The former introduced\r\nthe Bill for Married Women's Property Rights in the House, giving\r\nSenator Lindsay credit for being practically its author. Judge Beckner\r\ncordially supported this bill, saying he preferred it to one of his\r\nown, which he had introduced but would push only if it should be\r\nevident that Judge Vance's more liberal bill could not become law. To\r\nthe leadership of these two is due the vote of 79 ayes to 14 noes with\r\nwhich the bill passed the House. In the Senate it came near to defeat,\r\nbut was carried through by the strenuous efforts of its friends,\r\nespecially of Senators W. W. Stephenson, Rozel Weissinger and William\r\nGoebel. Senator Weissinger withdrew in favor of the House bill one of\r\nhis own, not so comprehensive. The bill passed on the very last day of\r\nthe session possible to finish business. The Senate vote was 21 yeas,\r\n10 nays.[284] It was signed March 15 by Gov. John Young Brown, who\r\nalways had favored it.\r\n\r\nAnother signal victory this year was School Suffrage for women of the\r\nsecond-class cities. Since 1838 widows with children of school age had\r\nbeen voters for school trustees in the country districts, and in 1888\r\nthis right was extended to allow tax-paying widows and spinsters to\r\nvote on school taxes. This general law, however, did not apply to\r\nchartered cities. The vigilance of Mrs. Farmer observed and seized\r\nthe opportunity offered by the revision of city charters, after the\r\nadoption of the new constitution, to put in clauses granting full\r\nSchool Suffrage to all women. At her instigation, in 1892, the equal\r\nrights associations of Covington, Newport and Lexington, the only\r\nsecond-class cities, petitioned the committee selected to prepare a\r\ncharter for such cities to insert a clause in the section on\r\neducation, making women eligible as members of school boards and\r\nqualified to vote at all elections of such boards. This was done, and\r\nthe charter passed the General Assembly in 1894, and was signed by\r\nGovernor Brown on March 19. The influence of the State association was\r\nnot sufficient, however, to have School Suffrage put in the charters\r\nof cities of the first, third and fourth classes. The Hons. Charles\r\nJacob Bronston, John O. Hodges, William Goebel and Joel Baker did\r\nexcellent service for this clause.\r\n\r\nThe changes wrought by liberal legislation and the part the State\r\nassociation had in securing this will be best understood by quotations\r\nfrom a leaflet issued by the State Association:\r\n\r\n     In 1888 the Kentucky E. R. A. was organized for the purpose of\r\n     obtaining for women equality with men in educational, industrial,\r\n     legal and political rights.\r\n\r\n     We found on the statute books a law which permitted a husband to\r\n     collect his wife's wages.\r\n\r\n     We found Kentucky the only State which did not allow a married\r\n     woman to make a will.\r\n\r\n     We found that marriage gave to the husband all the wife's\r\n     personal property which could be reduced to possession, and the\r\n     use of all her real estate owned at the time or acquired by her\r\n     after marriage, with power to rent the same and receive the rent.\r\n\r\n     We found that the common law of curtesy and dower prevailed,\r\n     whereby on the death of the wife the husband inherited absolutely\r\n     all her personalty and, when there were children, a life interest\r\n     in all her real estate; while the wife, when there were children,\r\n     inherited one-third of her husband's personalty and a\r\n     life-interest in one-third of his real estate.\r\n\r\n     I. In 1890 we secured a law which made the wife's wages payable\r\n     only to herself.\r\n\r\n     II. From the General Assembly of 1892-93 we secured a law giving\r\n     a married woman the right to make a will and control her real\r\n     estate.\r\n\r\n     III. From the General Assembly of 1894 we secured the present Law\r\n     for Husband and Wife. The main features of this are:\r\n\r\n     1. Curtesy and dower are equalized. After the death of either\r\n     husband or wife, the survivor is given a life estate in one-third\r\n     of the realty of the deceased and an absolute estate in one-half\r\n     of the personalty.\r\n\r\n     2. The wife has entire control of her property, real and\r\n     personal. She owns her personal property absolutely, and can\r\n     dispose of it as she pleases.[285] The statute gives her the\r\n     right to make contracts and to sue and be sued as a single woman.\r\n     This enables a married woman to enter business and hold her stock\r\n     in trade free from the control of her husband and liability to\r\n     his creditors.\r\n\r\n     3. The power to make a will is the same in husband and wife, and\r\n     neither can by will divest the other of dower or interest in his\r\n     or her estate.\r\n\r\n     These splendid property laws are pronounced by leading lawyers to\r\n     be the greatest legal revolution which has taken place in our\r\n     history.\r\n\r\nA section of the new constitution made it the duty of the General\r\nAssembly to provide by law as soon as practicable for Houses of Reform\r\nfor Juvenile Offenders. The State Woman's Christian Temperance Union\r\ndecided in 1892 to urge it to act speedily, and the Equal Rights\r\nAssociation co-operated heartily, with a special view to securing\r\nprovision for girls equal to that for boys, and women on the Board of\r\nManagers. A joint committee from the two associations was appointed,\r\nwith Mrs. Frances E. Beauchamp chairman for the former and Mrs. S. A.\r\nCharles for the latter. They compiled a bill with legal advice of\r\nSenator Bronston, who had been largely instrumental in securing the\r\nsection. The unremitting labor of three years was at last crowned with\r\nsuccess in 1896, when a bill, essentially that prepared by the women,\r\npassed the General Assembly and was signed by Gov. William O. Bradley,\r\nMarch 21.[286] This bill provides for two separate institutions, one\r\nfor girls and one for boys, on the cottage family plan. The general\r\ngovernment is vested in a board of six trustees, three women and three\r\nmen.\r\n\r\nFrom the General Assembly of 1898 the E. R. A. finally obtained the\r\nlaw making it mandatory to have at least one woman physician in each\r\nState insane asylum, for which they had been petitioning ten years.\r\nRepresentative W. C. G. Hobbs introduced the bill into the House,\r\nwhere it passed by a vote of 77 ayes, 4 noes. Mr. Bronston supported\r\nit in the Senate, where it received 26 ayes, one no. It was approved\r\nby Governor Bradley March 15.\r\n\r\nIn the same year the benevolent associations of the women of\r\nLouisville secured an act providing for police matrons in that city,\r\nthe only first-class one in the State, which was approved by the\r\nGovernor March 10.[287] The first police matron was appointed March 4,\r\nbefore the law required it, at the request of women and through the\r\ninfluence of Mayor Charles P. Weaver, Chief of Police Jacob H. Haager,\r\nJailer John R. Pflanz and Judge Reginald H. Thompson. By the action of\r\nthe State Board of Prison Commissioners this year, two women were\r\nappointed as guards for the women's wards in the penitentiary, their\r\nduties being such as usually pertain to a matron.\r\n\r\nThis year the Women's Club of Central Kentucky set on foot a movement\r\nfor a free library in Lexington. Senator Bronston secured a change in\r\nthe city charter to facilitate this object. The act provides that the\r\nlibrary shall be under the control of a board of five trustees and was\r\nintentionally worded to make women eligible. Mayor Joseph Simrall\r\nappointed two of the club women, Mrs. Mary D. Short and Mrs. Ida\r\nWithers Harrison. This is the first free library established in\r\nKentucky.\r\n\r\nOwing to the turbulent political conditions in the General Assembly of\r\n1900, the State association did not send its usual committee to the\r\ncapital. However, a committee from the W. C. T. U. did go, and\r\nsucceeded in securing an appropriation to build the young women's\r\ndormitory at the State College, receiving in this effort the\r\nencouragement of the E. R. A., as agreed upon at their convention of\r\n1899.\r\n\r\nThe history of the State association would not be complete without\r\nrecording its failures. In 1893 an effort to raise the \"age of\r\nprotection\" for girls from 12 to 18 was made a part of its work. It\r\nwas deemed expedient to place this in the hands of a special\r\ncommittee, Mrs. Thomas L. Jones and Mrs. Sarah G. Humphreys consenting\r\nto assume the arduous task. Mrs. Henry wrote a strong leaflet on the\r\n\"age of protection,\" and Mrs. Humphreys sent many articles to the\r\npress. A petition was widely circulated and bore thousands of names\r\nwhen the ladies carried it to the General Assembly in 1894. They\r\nsucceeded in having a bill introduced, and were given hearings before\r\nan appropriate committee; but the Assembly adjourned without acting.\r\nIn 1895, Mrs. Martha R. Stockwell was added to the committee, which\r\nagain went to the Assembly with the petition; but without success, and\r\nthe \"age of protection\" still remains 12 years. The penalty is death\r\nor imprisonment for life.\r\n\r\nBy special statute the Common Law is retained which makes 12 years the\r\nlegal age for a girl to marry.\r\n\r\nA law to make mothers equal guardians with fathers of minor children\r\nis one to which the State association has devoted much attention, but\r\nwhich still waits on the future for success. At present the father is\r\nthe legal guardian, and at his death may appoint one even for a child\r\nunborn. If the court appoints a guardian, the law (1894) requires that\r\nit \"shall choose the father, or his testamentary appointee; then the\r\nmother if [still] unmarried, then next of kin, giving preference to\r\nthe males.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband is expected to furnish the necessaries of life according\r\nto his condition, but if he has only his wages there is no law to\r\npunish him for non-support.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Kentucky was the first State in the Union to grant any form\r\nof suffrage to women by special statute, as its first School Law,\r\npassed in 1838, permitted widows in the country districts with\r\nchildren of school age to vote for trustees. In 1888 further\r\nextensions of School Suffrage were made and in the country districts,\r\nincluding fifth and sixth class cities, i. e., the smallest villages,\r\nany widow having a child of school age, and any widow or spinster\r\nhaving a ward of school age, may now vote for school trustees and\r\ndistrict school taxes; also taxpaying widows and spinsters may vote\r\nfor district school taxes.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the General Assembly granted women the right to vote for\r\nmembers of the board of education on the same terms as men in the\r\nsecond-class cities, by a special clause in their charter. There are\r\nthree of these--Covington, Newport and Lexington.[288]\r\n\r\nIn the one first-class city, Louisville, the five third-class and the\r\ntwenty or more fourth-class cities, no woman has any vote.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: In 1886 Mrs. Amanda T. Million was appointed to the\r\noffice of county superintendent of public schools. Her husband had\r\nbeen elected in Madison County, but dying at the commencement of his\r\nterm, Judge J. C. Chenault, after the eligibility of a woman had been\r\nascertained, appointed the widow to fill out the year. Mrs. Million\r\nthen became a candidate, and was elected for the remaining three years\r\nof the term, being the first woman in the State to fill that office.\r\nHer case attracted much attention and at the election in 1889 four\r\nwomen were elected county superintendents; in 1893, eight, and in\r\n1897, eighteen.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Mayor Henry T. Duncan appointed two women on the Lexington\r\nSchool Board, Mrs. Ida Withers Harrison and Mrs. Mary E. Lucas, to\r\nserve until their successors were elected under the laws of the new\r\ncharter. In August the women held a mass meeting, conducted by a joint\r\ncommittee from the local E. R. A., the W. C. T. U. and the Woman's\r\nClub of Central Kentucky, to nominate a woman from each ward. They\r\nnamed Mrs. Harrison, Mrs. Ella Williamson, Mrs. Sarah West Marshal and\r\nMrs. Mary C. Roark. This ticket was indorsed the same day by the\r\nCitizens' Association (of men). Judge Frank Bullock allowed private\r\nhouses to be used for women to register, one in each precinct, the\r\nregistration officers all to be women--clerk, two judges and a\r\nsheriff. They were sworn in and did their duty nobly. The Democratic\r\nand Republican parties refused to accept the Woman's Ticket. The women\r\ntherefore selected a man from each ward in addition to the four women\r\nnominated, making the required number of eight, known as the\r\nIndependent Ticket, which was triumphantly elected in November by\r\nvoters of all parties and both sexes.\r\n\r\nIn Covington, three women were placed on the Republican ticket, but\r\nwere defeated. About 5,000 women voted. In Newport two women were\r\nplaced on the Democratic ticket, but it was defeated. About 2,800\r\nwomen registered.\r\n\r\nThe Prohibitionists nominated Mrs. Josephine K. Henry for clerk of\r\nthe Court of Appeals in 1890. Though in many places the election\r\nclerks refused to enter her name on the polling-books, doubting the\r\neligibility of a woman, she received 4,460 votes. This case is worthy\r\nof note because it was the first in Kentucky where a woman was a\r\ncandidate for election to a State office; and because, as she ran on a\r\nplatform containing a suffrage plank, practically all the votes for\r\nher were cast for woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nWomen have been State librarians continuously since January, 1876,\r\nwhen the first one was elected.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the Senate for the first time elected a woman as enrolling\r\nclerk, and women have held this office ever since.\r\n\r\nDuring the session of 1900, stormy as it was, the House for the first\r\ntime elected a woman as enrolling clerk.\r\n\r\nWomen serve as notaries public. (For other offices see Legislative\r\nAction.)\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: Women are engaged in all the professions and no\r\noccupation is forbidden to them by law. On Dec. 15, 1886, the Court of\r\nAppeals affirmed the right of women to dispense medicines. The case\r\nwas that of Bessie W. White (Hager), a graduate of the School of\r\nPharmacy of Michigan University. She applied to the State Board of\r\nPharmacy for registration in 1883, complying with all the\r\nrequirements. They rejected her application, whereupon she applied for\r\na mandamus. The writ was granted but an appeal was taken. Judge\r\nWilliam H. Holt delivered the opinion of the Appellate Court, saying\r\nin his decision: \"It is gratifying to see American women coming to the\r\nfront in these honorable pursuits. The history of civilization in\r\nevery country shows that it has merely kept pace with the advancement\r\nof its women.\"\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: On April 27, 1889, at a called meeting of the Board of\r\nCurators of Kentucky University (Disciples of Christ) in Lexington, it\r\nwas decided to admit women students. This was the result of a petition\r\nthe preceding June by the Fayette County E. R. A. In response a\r\ncommittee had been appointed, President Charles Louis Loos, chairman,\r\nand, upon its favorable report, the resolution was carried by\r\nunanimous vote. An immediate appropriation was made for improvements\r\nto the college buildings to accommodate the new students, the opening\r\nwas announced in the annual calendar and women invited to avail\r\nthemselves of its advantages. This was the second institution of\r\nhigher education opened to women, the State Agricultural and\r\nMechanical College and Normal School, also in Lexington, having\r\nadmitted them in 1880.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 the work done by Mrs. Sarah Hardin Sawyer resulted in the\r\nadmission of women to Wesleyan College in Winchester. The Baptist\r\nCollege at Georgetown became co-educational through the influence of\r\nProf. James Jefferson Rucker. The Homeopathic Medical College, opened\r\nin Louisville the same year, admitted women from the first and placed\r\na woman upon the faculty. In 1893 the Madison County E. R. A. secured\r\nthe admission of girls to Central University at Richmond.\r\n\r\nCo-education now prevails in all the normal and business schools, and\r\nin the majority of the institutions of higher learning; the only\r\nnotable exceptions being Centre University, Danville; Baptist College,\r\nRussellville; Baptist Theological College[289] and Allopathic Medical\r\nCollege, Louisville.\r\n\r\nThere are in the public schools 4,909 men and 5,057 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $44; of the women, $37.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Emergency Association of Louisville, organized during the\r\nSpanish-American War, called a non-partisan mass meeting February 6,\r\n1900, \"for the special purpose of directing the attention of women to\r\nthe importance and necessity of using their influence on behalf of\r\ngood citizenship.\" The mass meeting was addressed by several prominent\r\ngentlemen, who deplored the spirit of lawlessness prevailing in the\r\nState and declared that the remedy rested with the women, but the\r\nsuggestion that these should have the franchise was not once made.\r\n\r\nThe State E. R. A. sent a memorial to the annual meeting of the\r\nKentucky Federation of Women's Clubs in 1900, soliciting their\r\nassistance in securing from the General Assembly the extension of\r\nSchool Suffrage to the women of all towns and cities. It was voted to\r\ngive the co-operation desired.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[278] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Laura Clay of\r\nLexington, president of the State Equal Rights Association since its\r\norganization, and first auditor of the National-American Woman\r\nSuffrage Association since 1895.\r\n\r\n[279] The State W. C. T. U. at its convention in 1892 adopted a\r\nfranchise department, and has proved a faithful and valuable ally in\r\neducating public sentiment and obtaining desired legislation.\r\n\r\n[280] In the congressional contest of the Seventh District, between W.\r\nC. P. Breckinridge and W. C. Owens, in 1894, the women took such a\r\nshare in defeating the former that their action became an instructive\r\npart of political history. Mrs. F. K. Hunt, president of their Owens\r\nClub, which did such distinguished service for public morality,\r\nafterwards became a member of the Equal Rights Association, this\r\ncampaign having convinced her, as she said, that \"there is a place for\r\nwomen in politics.\"\r\n\r\n[281] In the Presidential campaign of 1896, Mrs. Josephine K. Henry\r\nand Miss Margaret Ingals spoke for the Silver Democrats, and Mrs.\r\nFrances E. Beauchamp for the Prohibitionists, under the auspices of\r\nthe party committees.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1898, Mrs. Beauchamp, president of the State W. C. T. U., was\r\nelected permanent chairman and presided over the State Prohibition\r\nConvention held in Louisville--the first time a woman ever filled such\r\na position in Kentucky. She was also elected a member of the National\r\nCentral Committee of the Prohibitionists in 1899. This party has\r\nretained the woman suffrage plank in its State platform since 1889.\r\n\r\n[282] The other State officers have been, recording secretaries, Dr.\r\nSarah M. Siewers; Mesdames Mary Ritchie McKee, Mary Muggeridge, Mary\r\nR. Patterson, Sarah Hardin Sawyer, Kate Rose Wiggins; Misses Anna M.\r\nDeane, Mary Susan Hamilton, Mary E. Light; third vice-presidents,\r\nMesdames Sallie H. Chenault, S. M. Hubbard, Mary H. Johnson, Thomas L.\r\nJones, N. S. McLaughlin; Miss Belle Harris Bennett; superintendents of\r\npress, Mrs. Lida Calvert Obenchain, Mrs. Sarah G. Humphreys;\r\nsuperintendent of legislative work, Mrs. Josephine K. Henry.\r\n\r\n[283] This bill, drawn up with legal precision and clearness, was\r\npractically the one passed four years later (1894), which raised\r\nKentucky's property laws for wives to a just and honorable plane.\r\n\r\n[284] On the night of March 8 Mrs. Josephine K. Henry spoke in\r\nFrankfort on the subject of American Citizenship. The Legislative Hall\r\nwas voted unanimously and the Senate, which was holding night\r\nsessions, adjourned to hear her address. The Property Rights Bill was\r\non this night virtually dead. Mrs. Henry in her speech never alluded\r\nto this bill, but plainly asked the Legislature to create a power to\r\nwhich she could apply and receive her papers of citizenship, claiming\r\nthat she had every qualification save that of sex. The speech did not\r\nprocure for her the right to vote, but the next morning, amid the\r\ngreatest tumult, the dead Property Rights Bill was resurrected and\r\npassed.\r\n\r\n                                   Minutes of Kentucky E. R. A., 1894.\r\n\r\n[285] The wife can not dispose of real estate without the husband's\r\nsignature. He can convey real estate without her signature but it is\r\nsubject to her dower.\r\n\r\n[286] This year the E. R. A., the W. C. T. U. and the Woman's Club of\r\nCentral Kentucky petitioned Governor Bradley to appoint a woman\r\nphysician for the insane asylum at Lexington. He did appoint one, Dr.\r\nKathryn Houser, but placed her in the Hopkinsville asylum.\r\n\r\n[287] A notable feature of this act is that none shall be appointed\r\nwho has not been recommended by a committee composed of one woman\r\nselected by each of the following organizations: Home of Friendless\r\nWomen, Flower Mission, Free Kindergarten Association, Humane Society,\r\nCharity Organization Society, City Federation of Women's Clubs,\r\nKentucky Children's Home Society, W. C. T. U. and Women's Christian\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n[288] This Act was repealed in 1902 because more colored than white\r\nwomen voted in Lexington at the spring election. This is the only\r\ninstance where the suffrage has been taken from women after being\r\nconferred by a Legislature. [Eds.\r\n\r\n[289] This college was opened to women in 1902.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLII.\r\n\r\nLOUISIANA.[290]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of woman suffrage in Louisiana must center always about\r\nthe names of Mrs. Elizabeth Lyle Saxon and Mrs. Caroline E. Merrick.\r\nIn 1879, before there had been any general agitation of this question\r\nin the State, these ladies appeared before the convention which was\r\npreparing a new constitution, and urged that the ballot should be\r\ngranted to women on the same terms as to men. The only concession to\r\ntheir demands was a clause making women eligible to any office of\r\ncontrol or management under the School Laws of the State.\r\n\r\nMrs. Saxon continued to create equal suffrage sentiment until her\r\nremoval to another State, and Mrs. Merrick remains still a principal\r\nfigure in the movement. Until his death in 1897 she had the earnest\r\nencouragement and assistance of her distinguished husband, Edwin T.\r\nMerrick, for ten years Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of Louisiana\r\nprior to the Civil War.\r\n\r\nAs New Orleans is the only large city and contains one-fourth of the\r\npopulation of a State which is among the most conservative in the\r\nUnion, organized work naturally would be confined to this locality,\r\nbut up to 1884 it had no active club or society of women. In this year\r\nthere was a demand by the press that the women of New Orleans should\r\norganize for the promotion of the World's Cotton Centennial, to be\r\nheld there in the autumn and winter of 1884-85. This was done and the\r\nWoman's Department was a conspicuous feature of the centennial. Mrs.\r\nJulia Ward Howe of Massachusetts was the commissioner for the\r\nGovernment, different States sent capable representatives and there\r\nwas cordial co-operation with the women of New Orleans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  SUSAN LOOK AVERY.\r\n  Louisville, Ky., and Chicago, Ill.\r\n\r\n          HELEN PHILLEO JENKINS.\r\n          Detroit, Mich.\r\n\r\n      LOUISA SOUTHWORTH.\r\n      Cleveland, Ohio.\r\n\r\n  MARY BENTLEY THOMAS.\r\n  Ednor, Md.\r\n\r\n          KATE M. GORDON.\r\n          New Orleans, La.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1885, Miss Susan B. Anthony visited the city for two weeks.\r\nShe was deluged with invitations for addresses, and spoke in\r\nAgricultural Hall of the exposition at the request of the Press Club,\r\nin Tulane Hall under the auspices of the city teachers, at the Girls'\r\nHigh School and in half-a-dozen other places. Everywhere she was most\r\nwarmly welcomed and was favorably reported in the papers, although her\r\ndoctrines were new and unpopular. Mrs. Eliza J. Nicholson, owner and\r\nmanager of the _Picayune_, and Mrs. M. A. Field (Catharine Cole), of\r\nits editorial staff, gave pleasant manifestations of friendship. One\r\nof the addresses delivered by Miss Anthony was before the Woman's\r\nClub, which had been an outgrowth of the exposition committees. Mrs.\r\nMay Wright Sewall of Indiana gave an address on this same occasion.\r\nWhile this club had by no means been formed in the interests of\r\nsuffrage, it was a decided innovation and the first step out of\r\ntradition and conservatism.\r\n\r\nThe work of the women of Louisiana in the Anti-Lottery campaign of\r\n1891 is entitled to special mention. The lottery, as the great money\r\npower, controlled absolutely the politics of the State, and the\r\nleading newspapers were a unit in its support. The reform movement to\r\nprevent the renewal of its charter was without money, prestige or the\r\ninfluence of the press. The women came nobly to the rescue of this\r\napparently hopeless cause. They formed leagues for the collection of\r\nmoney, they called meetings, they assisted in every possible way to\r\neducate the public mind and awaken the public conscience. To them\r\nbelongs a large share of the credit for the final overthrow at the\r\npolls of this octopus corporation, which was so long a reproach to the\r\nState.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 the Portia Club was formed, a strictly suffrage organization,\r\nwith Mrs. Merrick as president.[291] Under its auspices the\r\nAssociation for the Advancement of Women held its annual congress in\r\nNew Orleans in 1895, during which Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby of\r\nWashington, D. C., gave an address on The Philosophy of Woman\r\nSuffrage. At another time Mrs. Clara C. Hoffman of Missouri lectured\r\nfor the club.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1895, Miss Anthony, president of the National Suffrage\r\nAssociation, accompanied by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of its\r\norganization committee, came again to New Orleans. The _Picayune_ said\r\nof their first appearance:\r\n\r\n     If any one doubted the interest which Southern women feel in the\r\n     all-absorbing question of the day, \"Woman and her Rights,\" that\r\n     idea would have been forever dispelled by a glance at the\r\n     splendid audience assembled last night. The hall was literally\r\n     packed to overflowing, not only with women but with men,\r\n     prominent representatives in every walk of life.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the Era[292] Club was organized with Miss Belle Van Horn as\r\npresident. The successful work of this society has been largely due to\r\nthe ability and personal influence of Mrs. Evelyn W. Ordway, a\r\nprogressive Massachusetts woman, professor of chemistry in Newcomb\r\nCollege, New Orleans, who was its second president. Miss Kate M.\r\nGordon was the third.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the Era united with the Portia Club in the beginning of a\r\nState suffrage association, of which Mrs. Merrick was made president.\r\nMrs. Mary C. C. Bradford of Colorado gave two lectures before the new\r\nassociation this year. Those who have represented this body at the\r\nnational conventions are Mrs. Merrick, Miss Katharine Nobles and Miss\r\nGordon.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 a convention was held in New Orleans to prepare a new State\r\nconstitution. A committee composed of Mrs. Marie Garner Graham, Miss\r\nNobles, Miss Gordon and Miss Jean Gordon appeared before the Suffrage\r\nCommittee in support of a petition for Full Suffrage for the educated,\r\ntaxpaying women of Louisiana, which had been presented to the\r\nconvention by the Hon. A. W. Faulkner. Mrs. Graham made an eloquent\r\nappeal in behalf of using the intelligence and morality embodied in\r\nthe woman's vote in solving the political problem of the South. The\r\ncommittee further requested that Mrs. Chapman Catt be permitted to\r\naddress the convention. The request was immediately granted and an\r\nofficial invitation courteously extended.\r\n\r\nMrs. Merrick, who was a delegate to the suffrage convention then in\r\nsession at Washington, urged that some prominent members of the\r\nNational Association should accompany this speaker on her important\r\nmission, and Miss Laura Clay of Kentucky and Miss Mary G. Hay of New\r\nYork were duly appointed. On February 24, in Tulane Hall, before the\r\nassembled convention and a large throng of listeners in the galleries,\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt made a strong argument for the enfranchisement of\r\nLouisiana women.\r\n\r\nFor many days woman suffrage was seriously considered as a means to\r\nthe end of securing white supremacy in the State. The following week\r\nthe Athenæum, the finest lecture hall in New Orleans, was crowded with\r\nmen and women from all classes of society anxious to hear more on this\r\ndaily topic of discussion, as presented by Mrs. Chapman Catt, Miss\r\nClay and Miss Frances A. Griffin of Alabama. Seats were reserved for\r\nthe members of the Constitutional Convention, who responded almost\r\nunanimously to the invitation to be present.\r\n\r\nDr. Henry Dickson Bruns, a member of the Suffrage Committee, bent\r\nevery effort to secure Full Suffrage for women as the only means to\r\neffect the reform in political conditions so much desired. The\r\nmajority report of the committee, however, contained only this clause:\r\n\"All taxpaying women shall have the right to vote in person or by\r\nproxy on all questions of taxation.\"\r\n\r\nWhile the women were greatly disappointed, this was really a signal\r\nvictory in so conservative a State.\r\n\r\nThose who supposed that women would make practically no use of this\r\nscrap of suffrage were soon to be undeceived. New Orleans was at this\r\ntime a city of 300,000 with absolutely no sewerage system; an\r\ninadequate water supply, and what there was of this in the hands of a\r\nmonopoly; an excellent drainage system plodding along for the want of\r\nmeans at a rate which would have required twenty years to complete it.\r\nThe return of yellow fever, the city's arch-enemy, after a lapse of\r\neighteen years, created consternation. Senseless quarantines prevailed\r\non all sides; business was paralyzed; property values had fallen;\r\ncommercial rivals to the right and left were pressing. A crisis was at\r\nhand, and all depended on the hygienic regeneration of the city.\r\n\r\nThe lawful limit of taxation had been reached. One of two ways alone\r\nremained--either to grant franchises to private corporations, or for\r\nthe taxpayers to vote to tax themselves for the necessary\r\nimprovements. Finally a plan was evolved, where, by a combination with\r\nthe drainage funds, the great public necessities--water, sewerage and\r\ndrainage--could be secured to the city by a tax of two mills on the\r\ndollar, covering a period of forty-two years. A similar proposition\r\nhad been voted down two years before, and little hope was entertained\r\nthat it would carry this time. Here was the women's opportunity. They\r\nfound that one-third of the taxpayers must sign a petition calling the\r\nelection to establish its legality. This meant that from 9,000 to\r\n10,000 signatures must be secured. They learned also that to carry the\r\nmeasure there must be a majority of numbers as well as of property\r\nvalues.\r\n\r\nRealizing that a campaign of education was on their hands, the Era\r\nClub called a mass meeting of women, at which prominent speakers\r\npresented the necessities of the situation. At its close a resolution\r\nwas adopted to form a Woman's League for Sewerage and Drainage, of\r\nwhich Miss Gordon was made president. The papers, which a short time\r\nbefore had been most vehement in their denunciation of suffrage for\r\ntaxpaying women, were now unanimous in commending their public spirit\r\nand predicting ultimate victory through the women.\r\n\r\nThe first work of the league was to secure a correct list of women\r\ntaxpayers, the number of whom had been variously estimated from 1,500\r\nto 7,000. Actual count proved that the names of more than 15,000 women\r\nappeared on the roll, about one-half the taxpayers of the entire city.\r\nLeaving a large margin for possible duplicates, foreign residents and\r\nchanges by death, a conservative estimate gave at least 10,000 women\r\neligible to vote. Few can realize the magnitude of this undertaking,\r\nfor the names were without addresses but simply given as owners of\r\nsuch and such pieces of property in such and such boundaries.\r\n\r\nThe work of location was at last accomplished, and then came the task\r\nof securing the names of these women to the petitions. The lists were\r\ndivided according to wards, with a chairman for each, who appointed\r\nlieutenants in the various precincts. Parlor meetings to interest\r\nwomen were held everywhere, in the homes of the rich, the poor and the\r\nmiddle classes. Volunteer canvassers were secured and suffrage\r\nsentiment awakened. Occasionally mass meetings of men and women\r\ntogether were called, and good speakers obtained to arouse the people\r\nto the necessity of voting for the tax. It was the number of women's\r\nsignatures which enabled the mayor to order the election.\r\n\r\nThe law carried with it the privilege of voting by proxy, and the\r\nwomen who were active in this movement had the great task of gathering\r\nup the proxies of all those who had not the courage to go to the\r\npolls. These had to be made out in legal form and signed by two\r\nwitnesses, and they then learned that no woman in Louisiana can\r\nlegally witness a document, so in all these thousands of cases it was\r\nnecessary to secure two men as witnesses. It made no difference\r\nwhether they could read or write, whether they owned property or not,\r\nif males it was sufficient.[293]\r\n\r\nThe election was held June 6, 1899. The _Picayune_, which, with the\r\nother papers, had opposed the extension of even this bit of suffrage\r\nto women, came out the next morning with a three-quarter-page picture\r\nof a beautiful woman, labeled New Orleans, on a prancing steed named\r\nProgress, dashing over a chasm entitled Sanitary Neglect and\r\nCommercial Stagnation, to a bluff called A Greater City, while in one\r\ncorner was a female angel with wings outspread, designated as Victory.\r\nThe two-page account began as follows:\r\n\r\n     The great election for Sewerage and Drainage has come and gone,\r\n     and with it a notable chapter in the history of woman's work in\r\n     New Orleans in behalf of municipal improvement. It is unanimously\r\n     conceded, as incontestably proven by facts, that but for the\r\n     number of signatures of women sent to the mayor the election\r\n     never would have been called. It was also conceded late yesterday\r\n     afternoon that the noble work of the women had won the day in\r\n     behalf of these much-needed improvements for our beloved city....\r\n\r\n     The politician has been crushed, and let the credit go where it\r\n     belongs. The women of New Orleans did it, under the leadership of\r\n     those two active, energetic and self-sacrificing young women, the\r\n     Misses Kate M. and Jean Gordon, and all the glory is theirs.\r\n     Woman plays a most important part in the politics and affairs of\r\n     this city. Whenever a crisis approaches, the men on the right\r\n     side appeal to her and the appeal is never in vain. She jumps\r\n     into the breach, and invariably victory perches upon her banner.\r\n     All honor to the fair sex! The women, or rather the few women who\r\n     were in the Sewerage and Drainage League, probably did as much\r\n     work for the special tax as all the men in this city put\r\n     together, and they did it quietly and thoroughly....\r\n\r\n     It was the first time in the history of New Orleans that women\r\n     were allowed the proud privilege of the suffrage, and it was a\r\n     novel sight to see them at the polls, producing their\r\n     certificates of assessment and then retiring to the booths,\r\n     fixing their ballots and depositing them in the boxes.... Enough\r\n     of them showed their independence of the sterner sex to prove to\r\n     the community that they are a deal more competent to wield the\r\n     ballot than a vast majority of the male suffragans. From what\r\n     some of the commissioners of election say, the women demonstrated\r\n     that they had observed the instructions as to voting with a great\r\n     deal more punctiliousness than the men. They had no difficulty in\r\n     arranging their ballots, and knew the routine better than many\r\n     men who had been in the habit of voting, not only early but\r\n     often.\r\n\r\nThis paper contained also an interview with Mrs. Merrick, of which the\r\nfollowing is a portion:\r\n\r\n     \"Women are saying everywhere, Mrs. Merrick, that much of the\r\n     glory of this day is due to you, for you were the first woman in\r\n     the State to pin your faith to the suffrage cause.\"\r\n\r\n     \"Without boasting,\" she said modestly, \"the women of Louisiana, I\r\n     think, do owe a little to me. For years I stood alone for their\r\n     enfranchisement, especially where questions of property and\r\n     taxation were concerned.... I may say I have fought, labored and\r\n     almost died for suffrage. I do hope to see the women of New\r\n     Orleans with the School and Municipal Suffrage before I die. I am\r\n     getting old now,\" she added sweetly; \"I am threescore and ten; I\r\n     cast my first vote to-day. It was only for sewerage and drainage;\r\n     but then it was for the protection of the home from the invasion\r\n     of disease, the better health of our city, the greater prosperity\r\n     of our commonwealth, and I am satisfied; for it will be\r\n     discovered that women hold the balance of power in all things\r\n     good and true, and our votes will soon be wanted in other\r\n     praiseworthy reforms.\"\r\n\r\nThe duties of the women did not end when they had voted for the tax.\r\nIt was necessary to have a Sewerage and Water Board of seven\r\ncommissioners, and the voters were to decide whether these should be\r\nelected by the people or appointed by the mayor with the ratification\r\nof the City Council. The politicians were determined on the former\r\nmethod, while the business interests of the city demanded the latter.\r\nThe women almost to a unit voted for appointment, and the majority of\r\n1,000 by which it was carried can be placed practically to the credit\r\nof the Woman's League for Sewerage and Drainage.[294] It was conceded\r\nthat of the 6,000 votes cast at this election, at least one-half were\r\nthose of women.\r\n\r\nThe tax was immediately levied, the necessary legislative and\r\nconstitutional authority was obtained, the bonds were all sold and the\r\nwork is now under way for a complete system of drainage, sewerage and\r\nwater supply.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In 1894 a law was passed permitting women\r\nto receive degrees from Law and Medical Schools; also one allowing a\r\nmarried woman to \"subscribe for, withdraw or transfer stock of\r\nbuilding, homestead or loan associations, and to deposit funds and\r\nwithdraw the same without the assistance and intervention of her\r\nhusband.\" This law was secured by these associations to protect their\r\nown interests.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the same privilege was extended in regard to depositing money\r\nin savings banks and withdrawing it, which a married woman could not\r\ndo up to this time.\r\n\r\nThe laws of Louisiana for the most part are a survival of the\r\nNapoleonic Code:\r\n\r\n     Art. 25. Men are capable of all kinds of engagements and\r\n     functions, unless disqualified by reasons and causes applying to\r\n     particular individuals. Women can not be appointed to any public\r\n     office, nor perform any civil functions, except those which the\r\n     law specially declares them capable of exercising. Widows and\r\n     unmarried women of age may bind themselves as sureties or\r\n     indorsers for other persons, in the same manner and with the same\r\n     validity as men who are of full age.\r\n\r\n     Art. 81. If a father has disappeared, leaving minor children born\r\n     during his marriage, the mother shall take care of them, and\r\n     shall exercise all the rights of her husband with respect to\r\n     their education and the administration of their estate.\r\n\r\n     Art. 82. If the mother contracts a second marriage, she can not\r\n     preserve her superintendence of her children, except with the\r\n     consent of a family meeting composed of the relations or friends\r\n     of the father. [Failing to call this family meeting, she forfeits\r\n     also her right to appoint a guardian at her death.]\r\n\r\n     Art. 121. The wife can not appear in court without the authority\r\n     of her husband, although she may be a public merchant,[295] or\r\n     possess her property separate from her husband.\r\n\r\n     Art. 122. The wife, even when she is separate in estate from the\r\n     husband, can not alienate, grant, mortgage, acquire, either by\r\n     gratuitous or encumbered title, unless her husband concurs in the\r\n     act, or yields his consent in writing.\r\n\r\n     Art. 126. A married woman over the age of twenty-one years, may,\r\n     by and with the authorization of her husband, and with the\r\n     sanction of the Judge, borrow money or contract debts for her\r\n     separate benefit and advantage, and to secure the same, grant\r\n     mortgages or other securities affecting her separate estate,\r\n     paraphernal or dotal.\r\n\r\n     Art. 135. The wife may make her last will without the authority\r\n     of her husband.\r\n\r\n     Art. 302. The following persons can not be tutors [_i. e._,\r\n     guardians]: 1. Minors, except the father and mother. 2. Women,\r\n     except the mother or grandmother. 3. Idiots and lunatics. 4.\r\n     Those whose infirmities prevent them from managing their own\r\n     affairs. 5. Those whom the penal law declares incapable of\r\n     holding a public office, etc.\r\n\r\n     Art. 1316. Married women, even if separated in property, can not\r\n     institute a suit for partition without the authorization of their\r\n     husbands or of the Judge.\r\n\r\n     Art. 1480. A married woman can not make a donation _inter vivos_\r\n     [between living persons] without the concurrence or special\r\n     consent of her husband, or unless she be authorized by the Judge.\r\n     But she needs neither the consent of her husband nor any judicial\r\n     authorization to dispose by donation _mortis causa_ [in prospect\r\n     of death].\r\n\r\n     Art. 1591. The following persons are absolutely incapable of\r\n     being witnesses to testaments: 1. Women of what age soever. 2.\r\n     Male children who have not attained the age of sixteen years\r\n     complete. 3. Persons who are insane, deaf, dumb or blind. 4.\r\n     Persons whom the criminal laws declare incapable of exercising\r\n     civil functions.\r\n\r\n     Art. 1664. A married woman can not accept a testamentary\r\n     executorship without the consent of her husband. If there is\r\n     between them a separation of property, she may accept it with the\r\n     consent of her husband, or, on his refusal, she may be authorized\r\n     by the courts.\r\n\r\n     Art. 1782. All persons have the capacity to contract, except\r\n     those whose incapacity is specially declared by law--these are\r\n     married women, those of insane mind, those who are interdicted,\r\n     and minors.\r\n\r\n     Art. 2335. The separate property of the wife is divided into\r\n     dotal and extradotal. Dotal property is that which the wife\r\n     brings to the husband to assist him in bearing the expenses of\r\n     the marriage establishment. Extradotal property, otherwise called\r\n     paraphernal property, is that which forms no part of the dowry.\r\n\r\n     Art. 2338. Whatever in the marriage contract is declared to\r\n     belong to the wife, or to be given to her on account of the\r\n     marriage by other persons than the husband, is part of the dowry,\r\n     unless there be a stipulation to the contrary.\r\n\r\n     Art. 2347. The dowry is given to the husband, for him to enjoy\r\n     the same as long as the marriage shall last.\r\n\r\n     Art. 2349. The income or proceeds of the dowry belong to the\r\n     husband, and are intended to help him support the charges of the\r\n     marriage, such as the maintenance of the husband and wife, that\r\n     of their children, and other expenses which he may deem proper.\r\n\r\n     Art. 2350. The husband alone has the administration of the dowry,\r\n     and his wife can not deprive him of it; he may act alone in a\r\n     court of justice for the preservation or recovery of the dowry,\r\n     against such as either owe or detain the same, but this does not\r\n     prevent the wife from remaining the owner of the effects which\r\n     she brought as her dowry.\r\n\r\n     Art. 2358. The wife may, with the authorization of her husband,\r\n     or, on his refusal, with the authorization of the Judge, give her\r\n     dotal effects for the establishment of the children she may have\r\n     had by a former marriage.\r\n\r\nAll accumulations after marriage, except by inheritance, here as in\r\nall States, are the property of the husband. Any wages the wife may\r\nearn, the very clothes she wears, belong entirely to him.\r\n\r\nThe laws of inheritance of separate property are practically the same\r\nfor widow and widower.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the persons and property of minor\r\nchildren. Until 1888 the custody of children while a divorce suit was\r\npending was given to the father, but now this is granted to the\r\nmother. The final guardianship is awarded by the Judge to the one who\r\nsucceeds in obtaining the divorce.\r\n\r\nBefore 1896 no \"age of protection\" for girls was named in the\r\nstatutes, but the penalty for rape was death. In this year, the Arena\r\nClub of New Orleans, a socio-economic society of women, secured a law\r\nfixing the age at 16 years. The penalty was changed to imprisonment,\r\nwith or without labor, for a period not exceeding five years, with no\r\nminimum penalty named.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Since 1898 taxpaying women have the right to vote in person\r\nor by proxy on all questions of taxation.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: The clause in the constitution of 1879 that made women\r\neligible to school offices was inoperative on account of some\r\ntechnicality, which in 1894 Mrs. Helen Behrens, a member of the Portia\r\nClub, succeeded in having removed. In 1896 Mrs. Evelyn W. Ordway, as\r\nchairman of a committee from the Era Club, presented a petition to the\r\nCity Council signed by all of the editors and many other\r\nrepresentative men of New Orleans, asking for the appointment of a\r\nwoman to an existing vacancy on the school board, but this was\r\nrefused. No women ever were appointed to such positions except in a\r\nfew country districts.\r\n\r\nThe office of State librarian had been held by a number of women\r\nprevious to 1898. The Constitutional Convention of that year,\r\nhowever, which gave the taxpayer's suffrage to women, swept away every\r\nvestige of their right to hold any office by adopting a clause\r\ndeclaring that only qualified voters should be eligible to office.\r\nUnder this ruling women can not serve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nThere are no women on the boards of any public institutions in the\r\nState and none has a woman physician.\r\n\r\nFour police matrons are employed by New Orleans, one for the parish\r\nprison, one for the police jail and two for station houses.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The State University at Baton Rouge is one of three in the\r\nUnited States which do not admit women to any department. Tulane, in\r\nNew Orleans, the largest university in Louisiana, admits women to\r\npost-graduate work and to the Departments of Law and Pharmacy, but the\r\nMedical Department is still closed to them. The H. Sophie Newcomb\r\nMemorial College for Girls is a part of Tulane University. It was\r\nendowed by Mrs. Josephine Louise Newcomb with $2,500,000 in memory of\r\nher daughter. At her death she left to it the remainder of her estate,\r\nvalued at $1,500,000.\r\n\r\nNew Orleans University (white) and Leland University (colored) are\r\nco-educational. Most of the other colleges in the State are open to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 1,991 men and 2,166 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $37; of the women, $29.70.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[290] The History is indebted for the material for this chapter to\r\nMiss Kate M. Gordon, president of the Era Club, Mrs. Evelyn W. Ordway\r\nand Mrs. Martha Gould, all of New Orleans.\r\n\r\n[291] Other presidents: Mrs. Elizabeth Lyle Saxon, Mrs. Evelyn W.\r\nOrdway, Miss Florence Huberwald, Mrs. Helen Behrens.\r\n\r\n[292] The clever reader between the lines will see that E. R.\r\nA.--Equal Rights Association--is concealed in this innocent appearing\r\nword.\r\n\r\n[293] Miss Kate M. Gordon herself obtained and voted 300 proxies.\r\nAfter the election the Business Men's Association of New Orleans\r\npresented her with a gold medal. [Eds.\r\n\r\n[294] So determined were the politicians to have this board elected,\r\ninstead of appointed, in order that they might get control of the\r\n$42,000,000 fund, that a bill for this purpose was passed by the\r\nLegislature of 1902 and signed by Gov. William W. Heard. The matter\r\nwill be carried to the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\n[295] Certain legal processes are necessary before a woman can engage\r\nin business on her own account.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIII.\r\n\r\nMAINE.[296]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe Maine Woman Suffrage Association entered upon its career in 1873,\r\nflourished until 1876 and then ceased active work, which was not\r\nresumed until 1885. In September of that year, a convention was called\r\nin co-operation with the New England W. S. A., which resulted in the\r\nreorganization of the society. The Rev. Henry Blanchard, D. D., pastor\r\nof the First Universalist Church at Portland, was elected president,\r\ncontinuing in that capacity until 1891. During these six years of\r\nunremitting service, twelve public meetings (with occasional executive\r\nsessions) are recorded, all of which were held in Portland and\r\naddressed by the best speakers on suffrage, including Mrs. Lucy Stone,\r\nHenry B. Blackwell, the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe\r\nand Mrs. Mary A. Livermore.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 Dr. Blanchard resigned and Mrs. Hannah J. Bailey was elected\r\npresident, as she said, \"because it was thought best to have a woman\r\nat the head of the organization in order to confute the argument, then\r\noften advanced by the legislators, that women do not want the ballot.\"\r\nMrs. Bailey's term of office expired in 1897, by her own request. In\r\nthe six years of her leadership, six public conventions took place,\r\nall in Portland. The business of the association having been\r\nsystematically arranged, a large amount of work was done in the\r\nexecutive meetings which occurred frequently.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a local club was organized in Portland, and this, as a live\r\nand aggressive force, has been of incalculable benefit to the cause.\r\nOther clubs were formed in this administration at Saco, Waterville and\r\nHampden. The last owes its existence to the efforts of Mrs. Jane H.\r\nSpofford, formerly of Washington, D. C., and for many years treasurer\r\nof the National Association.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the present incumbent, Mrs. Lucy Hobart Day, was chosen State\r\npresident. During the past three years there have been three annual\r\nconventions held respectively at Hampden, Waterville and Portland,\r\nwith one semi-annual conference at Saco. Miss Susan B. Anthony,\r\npresident of the National Association, was present at the first of\r\nthese and afterwards addressed a public meeting in Portland.\r\n\r\nIn addition to these conventions, in May, 1900, a series of public\r\nmeetings in the interest of further organization was held at Old\r\nOrchard, Saco, Waterville, Hampden, Winthrop, Monmouth, Cornish and\r\nPortland, arranged by the president and addressed by Miss Diana\r\nHirschler, a practicing lawyer of Boston.\r\n\r\nThe second week of August, 1900, was celebrated in Maine as \"Old Home\r\nWeek,\" and from the 7th to the 11th the State association kept \"open\r\nhouse\" in Portland to old and new friends alike. The register shows a\r\nrecord of 232 names, with fourteen States represented, from California\r\nto Maine.\r\n\r\nOn August 24, the association again made a new departure by holding a\r\nSuffrage Day at Ocean Park, Old Orchard, this being the first time\r\nMaine suffragists had appeared on the regular platform of any summer\r\nassembly in the State. The national president, Mrs. Carrie Chapman\r\nCatt, was in attendance and the day was a memorable one.\r\n\r\nSince 1898 the press department has taken on new life under the\r\nmanagement of Mrs. Sarah G. Crosby, and has grown from a circulation\r\nof six to eighty newspapers containing suffrage matter.\r\n\r\nNew clubs have been formed at Old Orchard and Skowhegan. A regular\r\nsystem of bi-monthly meetings of the executive committee has been\r\ninstituted, the business there transacted being reported to the\r\nvarious clubs, thus keeping the mother in touch with her\r\nchildren.[297]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: There have been several hearings before\r\nlegislative committees in the interest of a reformatory prison for\r\nwomen, together with repeated petitions for a matron of the State\r\nprison, so far with negative results.\r\n\r\nIn all changes of laws in favor of women much work has been done by\r\nthemselves. They have been instrumental also in securing the passage\r\nof laws against obscene literature, cigarettes and immoral kinetoscope\r\nexhibitions. They have opposed and prevented the appointment of a\r\nconspicuously immoral man as Judge; have prevented the pardon of\r\nnotoriously vile women in some marked cases, and have secured police\r\nmatrons in several of the large cities, also matrons of almshouses.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 a petition was presented to the Legislature asking for a\r\nconstitutional amendment in favor of woman suffrage. \"The significant\r\nvote\" was upon the third reading of the bill, when it was ordered to\r\nbe engrossed by 15 yeas, 13 nays in the Senate, and 67 yeas, 47 nays\r\nin the House; but as a two-thirds vote was necessary it failed to\r\npass.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the vote on a bill granting Municipal Suffrage to women stood\r\n42 yeas, 91 nays in the House; 18 yeas, 8 nays in the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the Judiciary Committee reported \"ought not to pass\" on the\r\nbill to confer Municipal Suffrage on women, to which the House voted\r\nto adhere, the Senate concurring.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 it was moved in the House to substitute the favorable minority\r\nreport for the majority report on the Municipal Suffrage Bill. This\r\nmotion was lost by 54 yeas, 63 nays. The Senate non-concurred with the\r\nHouse and accepted the minority report by 16 yeas, 13 nays.\r\n\r\nIn the campaign of 1895 an exceedingly active canvass for Municipal\r\nSuffrage was made by the use of petitions. These were circulated by\r\nthe State Association and the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, over\r\n9,000 names being sent to the Legislature. At the hearing before the\r\nJudiciary Committee every county in the State was represented, and the\r\nhall was crowded to its utmost capacity. The committee reported in\r\nfavor, and their report was accepted in the House by 79 yeas, 54\r\nnays. The Senate refused to concur in the action of the House by 11\r\nyeas, 15 nays.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the petitions for Municipal Suffrage were placed on file, the\r\nHouse and Senate concurring in this action.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 a bill was presented asking \"exemption from taxation for the\r\ntaxpaying women of Maine,\" on the ground that \"taxation without\r\nrepresentation is tyranny.\" The Committee on Taxation granted a\r\nhearing and reported \"leave to withdraw,\" which report was accepted in\r\nthe House, the Senate concurring.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy were abolished in 1895. If there is no will the\r\ninterest of the husband or wife in the real estate of the other is the\r\nsame; if there is issue of the marriage living, one-third absolutely;\r\nif no such issue, then one-half; if there is neither issue nor\r\nkindred, then the whole of it. The same provisions of law hold\r\nregarding the personal estate of each. Both a wife and a husband have\r\nthe right to claim their statutory share in the estate of the other in\r\npreference to any provision that may have been made by a will,\r\nprovided that such an election is made within a period of six months.\r\nThe widow is entitled to occupy the home for ninety days after the\r\nhusband's death, and to have support for that length of time. He is\r\naccorded the same privileges and the presence of a will does not\r\nchange the case. A more liberal allowance than formerly is granted to\r\nthe family from an insolvent estate.\r\n\r\nIn the presence of two witnesses, before marriage, the man and the\r\nwoman may determine what rights each shall have in the other's estate\r\nduring marriage and after its dissolution by death, and may bar each\r\nother of all rights in their respective estates not then secured to\r\nthem.\r\n\r\nA married woman may acquire and hold real and personal property in her\r\nown right, and convey the same without joinder of her husband. He has\r\nthe same legal privilege. The wife may control her own earnings, and\r\ncarry on business, and the profits are her sole and separate property.\r\n\r\nShe can prosecute and defend suits in her own name both in contract\r\nand in tort, and the wages of the wife and minor children are exempt\r\nfrom attachment in suits against the husband.\r\n\r\nDower, alimony and other provisions for the wife are made in case of\r\ndivorce for the husband's fault, and a law of 1895 compels the husband\r\nto support his family or contribute thereto (provided the separation\r\nwas not the fault of the wife) and the Supreme Judicial Court may\r\nenforce obedience.\r\n\r\nMaine is one of the few States in the Union where fathers and mothers\r\nhave equal guardianship of their children. (1895.)\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 13\r\nyears. In 1889 it was advanced to 14 years, providing unqualified\r\nprotection, with penalty of imprisonment for life or for a term of\r\nyears. In 1897 an act was passed providing a \"qualified\" protection\r\nfor girls between 14 and 16--that is, protection from men over\r\ntwenty-one years of age.\r\n\r\nSome of the above laws have originated with the legislators\r\nthemselves. Others have been asked for by the women of the State,\r\nthrough the medium of the W. S. A., the W. C. T. U. and the Woman's\r\nCouncil; but in the various organizations it has been those who are\r\nsuffragists that have carried these measures to a successful\r\nissue.[298]\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women have no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: At the present time women are filling offices,\r\nelective and appointive, as follows: School superintendents, 69;\r\nschool supervisor, one; school committee, 112; public librarians, 40;\r\ntrustee of State insane asylum, one; physician on board of same, one;\r\nmatron of same, one; supervisor female wards of same, one; police\r\nmatrons, 2; visiting committee of State Reform School, one; trustees\r\nof Westbrook Seminary, 3; Stenographic commissioners, 4; trustees of\r\nGirls' State Industrial School, 2; principal of same, one; matrons of\r\nsame, 3.\r\n\r\nThere are fifteen women justices of the peace, with authority to\r\nadminister oaths and solemnize marriages.\r\n\r\nWomen are eligible also as deputy town clerk and register of probate.\r\nThey can not serve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: As early as 1884 Maine had women lawyers, ministers,\r\nphysicians, authors and farmers. No occupation is forbidden them by\r\nlaw, and they are found in all departments of work. Since 1887 the\r\nworking day for women and children is limited to ten hours.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The educational advantages accorded to women are equal to\r\nthose of men. Bates College, Colby College and the State University,\r\nincluding the Agricultural Department, were opened to them before\r\n1884. Bowdoin College alone does not admit women.\r\n\r\nThere are in the public schools 1,020 men and 5,427 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $35; of the women, $27.20.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nDuring the past ten years the literary club movement has done an\r\nimmense amount of educational work, and Maine was the first State to\r\nfederate. In 1899 the federation instituted a system of traveling\r\nlibraries, which has become a great power for good in the rural\r\ndistricts, and several clubs circulate libraries of their own. It also\r\nhas secured minor bills on educational matters.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 two important institutions were established--the Home for\r\nFriendless Girls, in Belfast, and the Home for Friendless Boys, in\r\nPortland. There are also other homes for children.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the Invalids' Home (now the Mary Brown Home, in honor of its\r\nfounder) was incorporated. Any woman in Portland of good character may\r\nbe admitted to it for $3 a week.\r\n\r\nAll of the above were organized by women, and are managed by them.\r\n\r\nThis in brief is the history of woman's progress in the Pine Tree\r\nState since 1884.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[296] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Lucy Hobart Day\r\nof Portland, president of the State Suffrage Association, whose work\r\nis done under the motto, \"In order to establish justice.\"\r\n\r\n[297] State officers for 1900: President, Mrs. Lucy Hobart Day;\r\nvice-president-at-large, Mrs. S. J. L. O'Brion; vice-president, Mrs.\r\nSarah Fairfield Hamilton; corresponding secretary, Miss Anne Burgess;\r\nrecording secretary, Miss Lillia Floyd Donnell; treasurer, Dr. Emily\r\nN. Titus; auditor, Miss Eliza C. Tappan; superintendent press work,\r\nMiss Vetta Merrill.\r\n\r\nAmong others who have served are Mesdames Lillian M. N. Stevens, Etta\r\nHaley Osgood, Winnifred Fuller Nelson and Helen Coffin Beedy; Miss\r\nLouise Titcomb and Dr. Jane Lord Hersom.\r\n\r\n[298] Among those who have been instrumental in securing better\r\nlegislation for the women of the State may be mentioned the Hon.\r\nThomas Brackett Reed, Judge Joseph W. Symonds, Franklin Payson;\r\nex-Governors Joseph Bodwell, Frederick Robie, Henry B. Cleaves and\r\nLlewellyn Powers; Mesdames Augusta Merrill Hunt, Margaret T. W.\r\nMerrill and Ann Frances Greeley; Dr. Abby Mary Fulton and the Misses\r\nCornelia M. Dow, Charlotte Thomas and Elizabeth Upham Yates.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIV.\r\n\r\nMARYLAND.[299]\r\n\r\n\r\nIf but one State in the Union allowed woman to represent herself it\r\nshould be Maryland, which was named for a woman, whose capital was\r\nnamed for a woman, and where in 1647 Mistress Margaret Brent, the\r\nfirst woman suffragist in America, demanded \"place and voyce\" in the\r\nAssembly as the executor and representative of her kinsman, Lord\r\nBaltimore. Her petition was denied but she must have had some gallant\r\nsupporters, as the archives record that the question of her admission\r\nwas hotly debated for hours. After the signal defeat of Mistress\r\nBrent, there seems to have been no demand for the ballot on the part\r\nof Maryland women for about 225 years.[300]\r\n\r\nIn 1870 and '71 Miss Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. Lucy Stone and Mrs. Julia\r\nWard Howe lectured in Baltimore and there was some slight agitation of\r\nthe subject.\r\n\r\nImmediately following the national suffrage convention of 1883, in\r\nWashington, Miss Phoebe W. Couzins of Missouri addressed a large and\r\nenthusiastic audience at Sandy Spring. Soon afterwards Madame Clara\r\nNeymann of New York spoke in the same place and was cordially\r\nreceived. She and Mrs. Caroline Hallowell Miller were invited about\r\nthis time to make addresses at Rockville. Mrs. Miller also spoke on\r\nthe rights and wrongs of women at the Sandy Spring Lyceum.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Mrs. Miller invited some of her acquaintances to meet at her\r\nhome in Sandy Spring to form a suffrage association. Thirteen men and\r\nwomen became members, all but one of whom belonged to the Society of\r\nFriends.[301] This year Maryland was represented for the first time at\r\nthe national suffrage convention by a delegate, Mrs. Sarah T. Miller.\r\nShe is now superintendent of franchise in the State Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union, this department having been adopted in 1893.\r\n\r\nAnnual State conventions have been held since 1889 and about 300\r\ndifferent members have been enrolled. The membership includes many\r\nmen; one public meeting was addressed by a father and daughter, and a\r\nmother and son. The officers for 1900 are: President, Mary Bentley\r\nThomas; vice-president, Pauline W. Holme; corresponding secretary,\r\nAnnie R. Lamb; recording secretary, Margaret Smythe Clarke; treasurer,\r\nMary E. Moore; member national executive committee, Emma J. M. Funck.\r\n\r\nThe first to organize a suffrage club in Baltimore was Mrs. Sarah H.\r\nTudor. It has now a flourishing society and many open meetings have\r\nbeen held with large and interested audiences.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 six members of the W. C. T. U. of Baltimore went before the\r\nregistrars and demanded that their names should be placed on the\r\npolling books. Mrs. Thomas J. Boram, whose husband was one of the\r\nregistrars, was spokeswoman and claimed their right to vote under the\r\nConstitution of the United States. She made a strong argument in the\r\nname of taxpaying women and of mothers but was told that the State\r\nconstitution limited the suffrage to males. The other ladies were Dr.\r\nEmily G. Peterson, Miss Annie M. V. Davenport, Mrs. Jane H. Rupp, Mrs.\r\nC. Rupp and Mrs. Amanda Peterman.\r\n\r\nAmong the outside speakers who have come into the State at different\r\ntimes are the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, vice-president-at-large of the\r\nNational Association, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the\r\nnational organization committee, Mrs. Mary C. C. Bradford of Colorado,\r\nMiss Elizabeth Upham Yates of Maine, the Rev. Henrietta G. Moore of\r\nOhio, Mrs. Annie L. Diggs and Miss Laura A. Gregg of Kansas, Miss\r\nHelen Morris Lewis of North Carolina, Mrs. Ruth B. Havens of\r\nWashington, D. C., and Mrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch of Chicago.\r\n\r\nOne of the first and most efficient of the workers is Mrs. Caroline\r\nHallowell Miller, who has represented her State for many years at the\r\nnational conventions and pleased the audiences with her humorous but\r\nstrong addresses. Her husband, Francis Miller, a prominent lawyer, was\r\none of the very few men in the State who advocated suffrage for women\r\nas early as 1874, when he made an appeal for the enfranchisement of\r\nthe women of the District of Columbia before the House Judiciary\r\nCommittee.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: The constitution of Maryland opens as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     The right of the people to participate in the Legislature is the\r\n     best security of liberty and the foundation of all free\r\n     government; for this purpose, elections ought to be free and\r\n     frequent; and every male (!) citizen having the qualifications\r\n     prescribed by the constitution ought to have the right of\r\n     suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature has been petitioned to grant full suffrage to women;\r\nto raise the \"age of protection\" for girls, and to refrain from giving\r\nState aid to institutions of learning which do not admit women\r\nstudents on equal terms with men.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of 1900 took a remarkably progressive step. An act\r\nauthorizing the city of Annapolis to submit to the voters the question\r\nof issuing bonds to the amount of $121,000, to pay off the floating\r\nindebtedness and provide a fund for permanent improvements, contained\r\na paragraph entitling women to vote.\r\n\r\nThis bill was introduced in the Senate January 25, by Elijah Williams\r\nand was referred to the Committee on Finance. On January 31, Austin L.\r\nCrothers reported it favorably. On February 1, at the motion of\r\nSenator Williams, the bill was recommitted and on the 15th Senator\r\nCrothers again reported it favorably. On the 19th it was passed by the\r\nSenate unanimously.\r\n\r\nThe Senate Bill was presented to the House of Delegates February 20,\r\nand referred to the Committee on Ways and Means. On the 28th,\r\nFerdinand C. Latrobe (who had been mayor of Baltimore four or five\r\ntimes) reported the bill favorably. On March 23 it was passed by the\r\nHouse, 69 yeas, one nay, the negative vote being cast by Patrick E.\r\nFinzel of Garrett County.\r\n\r\nIt is a common practice of the General Assembly to pass laws\r\napplicable only to one county or portion of a county, or to one\r\nmunicipality or to one special occasion, as in this instance.\r\n\r\nAs this law was a decided innovation in a very conservative community,\r\nnaturally the number of women availing themselves of it for the first\r\ntime was not large, and it hardly seemed worth a special Act of the\r\nLegislature, except as a progressive step. The Baltimore _Sun_ of May\r\n14 said:\r\n\r\n     Women voted in Annapolis to-day under the law permitting property\r\n     owners to say if $121,000 bonds shall be issued for street and\r\n     other improvements. The novelty of their presence did not disturb\r\n     the serenity of the polling-room or unnerve the ladies who were\r\n     exercising their right to vote for the first time. They were\r\n     calm, direct and as unruffled as though it were the usual order\r\n     of things. Those who voted are of the highest social standing.\r\n     They received the utmost courtesy at the polls and voted without\r\n     any embarrassment whatever.\r\n\r\nNumerous changes in the statutes have been made during the past twelve\r\nyears, modifying the discriminations against married women under the\r\nold Common Law.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 it was enacted that a wife might bring action for slander in\r\nher own name and defend her own character.\r\n\r\nThe last of these improved laws went into effect in 1898, when the\r\ninheritance of property was made the same for widow and widower.\r\nAbsolute control of her own estate was vested in the wife. Power was\r\ngiven her to make contracts and bring suit, and she alone was to be\r\nliable for her own actions.\r\n\r\nInequalities still exist, however, in regard to divorce and\r\nguardianship of children. The fifth ground for absolute divorce is as\r\nfollows: \"Where the woman before marriage has been guilty of illicit\r\ncarnal intercourse with another man, the same being unknown to the\r\nhusband at the time of marriage.\" A similar act on the part of the\r\nhusband prior to the marriage does not entitle the wife to a divorce.\r\n\r\nThe father has complete control of the minor children and may appoint\r\na guardian by will. If he die without doing so the mother becomes\r\ntheir natural guardian, but her control over a daughter terminates at\r\neighteen years of age while the father's continues to twenty-one. This\r\npower of appointing a testamentary guardian was created by an act of\r\nCharles II, and adopted as a part of the laws of Maryland. It gives\r\nthe father power, by deed or will, to dispose of the custody and\r\ntuition of his infant children up to the age of twenty-one, or until\r\nthe marriage of the daughters. It gives him custody of their persons\r\nand all their real and personal estate, not only such as comes from\r\nhis family, but all they may acquire of any person soever, even from\r\nthe family of the mother. The guardian is placed _in loco parentis_\r\nand his rights are generally regarded as paramount.\r\n\r\nFor non-support of the family the husband may be fined $100 or\r\nimprisoned in the House of Correction not exceeding one year, or both,\r\nat discretion of the court. (1896.)\r\n\r\nWife-beaters are punished by flogging or imprisonment.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 women succeeded in having the \"age of protection\" for girls\r\nraised from 14 to 16 years, with penalty ranging from death to\r\nimprisonment in the penitentiary for eighteen months.\r\n\r\nEmployers are compelled to provide seats for female employes. Children\r\nunder twelve can not work in factories. Women or girls may not be\r\nemployed as waiters in any place of amusement.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women have no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: The State librarian is a woman, who has filled the\r\nposition most satisfactorily for a number of years and through her\r\ncare valuable documents relating to colonial times have been saved\r\nfrom destruction and classified. A leading paper of Baltimore said\r\nthat these had been allowed to remain in the cellar of the State House\r\nfor years, and would have been ruined but for the new system of public\r\nhousekeeping inaugurated by the womanly element.\r\n\r\nWomen physicians have been placed in charge of women patients at one\r\nState insane asylum.\r\n\r\nPolice matrons are employed at all the station houses in Baltimore.\r\nDuring the past two years women have been placed on its jail boards\r\nand on the boards of most of its charitable and reformatory\r\ninstitutions. By the recommendation of two mayors they have been put\r\non the school board. They have applied for positions on the\r\nstreet-cleaning board but without success.\r\n\r\nWomen are doing efficient work on the jail and almshouse boards of\r\nHarford County and the school boards of Montgomery.\r\n\r\nWomen serve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: In 1901 Miss Etta Maddox, a graduate of the Baltimore\r\nCollege of Law, was refused admission to the bar and carried her case\r\nto the Supreme Court. It was argued before the full bench and the\r\nopinion rendered by Justice C. J. McSherry, November 21. Her petition\r\nwas denied on the ground that the act providing for admission to the\r\nbar uses the masculine pronouns. In this decision the general\r\nproposition was affirmed that \"women are excluded from all occupations\r\nwhich were denied them by the English common law, except when the\r\ndisability has been removed by express statutory enactment.\"[302] It\r\nis believed that this opinion makes it illegal for women to serve as\r\nnotaries public, and as a number have been serving for several years,\r\nthree in Baltimore, the situation promises to be very serious, many\r\ndeeds, etc., having been acknowledged before them.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Through the leadership of Miss Mary E. Garrett and Dr. M.\r\nCarey Thomas, president of Bryn Mawr College, assisted by Miss Mary\r\nGwinn and Miss Elizabeth King (now Mrs. William Ellicott), committees\r\nof prominent women were organized in various States for raising a fund\r\nto open a Medical Department in Johns Hopkins University which should\r\nbe co-educational. The trustees required an endowment of $500,000. The\r\ncommittees raised $200,000 and Miss Garrett herself added the\r\nremaining $300,000. In 1893 this Medical College, which is not\r\noutranked in the country, was dedicated alike to men and women with\r\nabsolutely no distinction in their privileges. Women are not admitted\r\nto any other department of Johns Hopkins.\r\n\r\nOf the nine other colleges and universities two are open to women, and\r\nthe Woman's College of Baltimore, which receives State aid, is for\r\nthem alone. They may be graduated from the Baltimore Colleges of Law\r\nand of Dentistry. The State Colleges of Agriculture, of Medicine and\r\nof Law are closed to them. The State Normal Schools admit both sexes\r\non equal terms.\r\n\r\nThere are 1,162 men and 3,965 women teachers in the public schools. It\r\nis impossible to obtain the average monthly salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[299] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Mary Bentley\r\nThomas of Ednor, who for the last nine years has been president of the\r\nState Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[300] Miss Mary Catherine Goddard conducted the Baltimore post-office\r\nand also the only newspaper in the city, the _Maryland Journal and\r\nCommercial Advertiser_, through all the trying times of the\r\nRevolutionary War. On July 12, 1775, she published a detailed account\r\nof the battle of Bunker Hill, which had occurred on June 17, and the\r\nDeclaration of the Continental Congress giving the causes and\r\nnecessity for taking up arms. The first official publication of the\r\nDeclaration of Independence, with the signers' names attached, was\r\nentrusted by Congress, at that time sitting in Baltimore, to Miss\r\nGoddard.\r\n\r\nShe remained in control of her paper for ten years. In 1779 she made\r\nan appeal through its columns for the destitute families of the\r\nAmerican soldiers, and by her efforts $25,000 were raised for their\r\nneeds.\r\n\r\n[301] The charter members were Caroline H., Margaret E., Sarah T.,\r\nRebecca T. and George B. Miller, Margaret B. and Mary Magruder, Ellen\r\nand Martha T. Farquhar, James P. and Jessie B. Stablu, Hannah B.\r\nBrooke and Mary E. Moore. At the second meeting a number of others\r\nbecame members, including the writer of this chapter.\r\n\r\n[302] State Senator Jacob M. Moses presented a bill in the Legislature\r\nof 1902 to permit women to practice law, which passed, was signed by\r\nthe Governor and Miss Maddox was admitted to the bar.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLV.\r\n\r\nMASSACHUSETTS.[303]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first suffrage convention ever held which assumed a national\r\ncharacter by inviting representatives from other States took place in\r\nWorcester, Mass., Oct. 23, 24, 1850.[304]\r\n\r\nThe New England Woman Suffrage Association was formed at Boston in\r\nNovember, 1868, with Mrs. Julia Ward Howe as president; and the\r\nMassachusetts Association was organized in the same city Jan. 28,\r\n1870, of which also Mrs. Howe was elected president. In 1871 Henry B.\r\nBlackwell, editor of the _Woman's Journal_, was made corresponding\r\nsecretary of both associations and has filled the office of the latter\r\ncontinuously, of the former twenty-two years.\r\n\r\nFrom those years until the present each of these bodies has held an\r\nannual meeting in Boston and they have almost invariably been\r\naddressed by men and women of State, of national and of international\r\nreputation. They have met in various churches and halls, but of late\r\nyears the historic old Faneuil Hall has been selected. The State\r\nassociation meets in the winter and the New England association during\r\nAnniversary Week in May, when there are business sessions with reports\r\nfrom the various States, public meetings and a great festival or\r\nbanquet. The last is attended by hundreds of people, all the tickets\r\nare frequently sold weeks in advance, and with its prominent\r\nafter-dinner speakers it has long been an attractive feature.[305]\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1884 was held January 22, 23, presided over by\r\nWilliam I. Bowditch, who had succeeded the Rev. Dr. James Freeman\r\nClarke as president in 1878. A number of fine addresses were given and\r\nthe official board was unanimously re-elected.[306] Mr. Bowditch's\r\nopening address was afterwards widely circulated as a tract, The\r\nForgotten Woman in Massachusetts.\r\n\r\nIt was voted that a fund should be raised to organize local suffrage\r\nassociations or leagues throughout the State, and that, as soon as\r\n$2,500 was in hand, an agent should be put in the field. Mr. Bowditch,\r\nMiss Louisa M. Alcott, John L. Whiting and Henry H. Faxon each\r\nsubscribed $100 on the spot; $800 was raised at the meeting and more\r\nthan $2,500 within four months.\r\n\r\nThis year, in the death of Wendell Phillips, the cause of equal rights\r\nlost one of its earliest and noblest supporters. On February 28 an\r\nimpressive memorial service was held in Boston. Mrs. Howe presided and\r\nthe other speakers were William Lloyd Garrison, Theodore D. Weld,\r\nJudge Thomas Russell, Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney, Elizur Wright, the Rev.\r\nSamuel May, George W. Lowther, Mrs. Lucy Stone and Mr. Blackwell. John\r\nBoyle O'Reilly and William P. Liscomb read memorial poems.\r\n\r\nFifty-seven meetings were held this year in different parts of the\r\nState, arranged by Arthur P. Ford and Miss Cora Scott Pond. The\r\nspeakers were the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, Miss Matilda Hindman, Miss\r\nPond and Miss Ida M. Buxton, and at some of the meetings Lucy Stone,\r\nMr. Blackwell and Mrs. Adelaide A. Claflin. In addition six\r\nconventions were held and a large number of local leagues were formed.\r\nSuffrage sociables were given monthly in Boston. Leaflets were\r\nprinted, including Wendell Phillips' great speech at the Worcester\r\nConvention in 1850, which were sent out by tens of thousands, and\r\n50,000 special copies of the _Woman's Journal_ were distributed\r\ngratuitously. Mrs. H. M. Tracy Cutler was employed for a month in\r\nWorcester to enlist interest in the churches, and Miss Pond for two\r\nmonths in Boston. Letters were sent to every town, with postal cards\r\ninclosed for reply, to find who were friends of suffrage, and to those\r\nso found a letter was sent asking co-operation. This constitutes an\r\naverage twelve months' work for the past thirty years.\r\n\r\nThe sixteenth annual meeting of the New England Association took place\r\nMay 26, 27, Lucy Stone presiding. The Rev. Minot J. Savage and Edward\r\nM. Winston of Harvard University were among the speakers. The two\r\nassociations united as usual in the May Festival. Letters of greeting\r\nwere read from the Hons. George F. Hoar, John D. Long and John E.\r\nFitzgerald, Postmaster Edward S. Tobey, Col. Albert Clarke and\r\nChancellor William G. Eliot, of Washington University, St. Louis. The\r\nRev. Robert Collyer, Mr. Garrison and the Rev. Miss Shaw made\r\naddresses.\r\n\r\nAt the State convention, Jan. 27, 28, 1885, addresses were made by\r\nMrs. Margaret Moore of Ireland, A. S. Root of Boston University, and\r\nthe usual brilliant galaxy, while letters expressing sympathy with the\r\ncause were read from John G. Whittier, the Rev. Samuel Longfellow, the\r\nRev. Samuel J. Barrows and many others. An appeal to the Legislature,\r\nwritten by Lucy Stone, was unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nAn Anti-Woman Suffrage Association formed in Massachusetts the\r\nprevious year, had devoted itself chiefly to securing signatures of\r\nwomen to a protest against the franchise. In 1885 Mrs. Kate Gannett\r\nWells and her associates obtained the signatures of about 140\r\ninfluential men to a remonstrance against \"any further extension of\r\nsuffrage to women,\" and published it as an advertisement in the Boston\r\n_Herald_ of Sunday, February 15. The list included President Eliot of\r\nHarvard, a number of college professors, one or two literary men,\r\nseveral ex-members of the Legislature, and a number of clergymen of\r\nconservative churches; but it was made up largely of those prominent\r\nchiefly on account of their wealth.\r\n\r\nAn average of ten suffrage meetings and conventions a month were held\r\nin various cities throughout the year. The Rev. Miss Shaw and Miss\r\nPond attended nearly all, and Mrs. Stone, Mr. Blackwell, Mrs. Claflin,\r\nMr. Garrison, Miss Eastman and Mr. Bowditch addressed some of them,\r\nbesides local speakers. Two thousand persons gathered in Tremont\r\nTemple on the opening night of the May anniversary, Lucy Stone\r\npresiding. Senator Hoar, Mrs. Livermore and others made short speeches\r\nand later responded to toasts at the Festival.\r\n\r\nMr. Blackwell presided over the State convention Jan. 26, 1886. At the\r\nNew England meeting this year Frederick Douglass delivered an oration\r\nand spoke also at the Festival, over which Miss Eastman presided. The\r\nassociation kept Miss Shaw in the field for six months and Miss Pond\r\nthroughout the year and held summer conventions in Cottage City and\r\nNantucket, besides ten county conventions in the fall. There were\r\n123,014 pages of literature sent out and agents visited seventy-five\r\ntowns. A suffrage bazar was held in December with Mrs. Livermore as\r\npresident and Mrs. Howe as editor of the _Bazar Journal_. The list of\r\nvice-presidents included Phillips Brooks and many other distinguished\r\npersons. The brunt of the work, however, was borne by Miss Pond and\r\nMiss Shaw, and the bazar cleared $6,000.\r\n\r\nMrs. Howe, Mrs. Stone, Mr. Garrison, Mrs. Cheney, State Senator Elijah\r\nA. Morse and others addressed the annual convention of 1887.\r\nPetitions were circulated for Municipal and Presidential Suffrage and\r\na constitutional amendment; also for police matrons, the raising of\r\nthe age of protection for girls, improvements in the property rights\r\nof married women, a bill enabling husbands and wives to make legal\r\ncontracts with each other, and one making women eligible to all\r\noffices from which they are not debarred by the constitution. In March\r\nthe association gave $1,000 to the constitutional amendment campaign\r\nin Rhode Island, and a number of the officers contributed their\r\nservices.\r\n\r\nMrs. Howe presided at the May Festival, and among the speakers were\r\nMrs. Helen M. Gougar of Indiana, Mrs. J. Ellen Foster of Iowa, the\r\nRevs. Henry Blanchard of Maine and Frederick A. Hinckley of Rhode\r\nIsland. Mr. Garrison read an original poem rejoicing over the granting\r\nof Municipal Suffrage in Kansas. At the New England Convention which\r\nfollowed, these speakers were reinforced by the Rev. Jenkyn Lloyd\r\nJones of Chicago. On October 19 the State Association gave a reception\r\nto Miss Frances E. Willard, president of the National Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union, at the Hotel Brunswick.\r\n\r\nIn December a great bazar was held in Boston for the joint benefit of\r\nthe American Suffrage Association and various States which took part.\r\nThe gross receipts were nearly $8,000. This year the association moved\r\ninto larger offices at No. 3 Park street; held fifty-one public\r\nmeetings and four county conventions and organized twenty-one new\r\nleagues. The _Woman's Journal_ was sent for three months to all the\r\nmembers of the Legislature; 378,000 pages of suffrage literature were\r\nsold and many thousands more given away.\r\n\r\nDuring the annual meeting in February, 1888, a reception was given to\r\nMrs. Rebecca Moore, of England, at which John W. Hutchinson sang and\r\nmany bright speeches were made. At the twentieth anniversary of the\r\nNew England association, in May, Lucy Stone presided. Mrs. Laura\r\nOrmiston Chant and Mrs. Alice Scatcherd of England, and Baroness\r\nGripenberg and Miss Alli Trygg of Finland, were among the speakers.\r\nOthers were Miss Clara Barton, Mrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker of\r\nConnecticut, the Hon. William Dudley Foulke and Mrs. Zerelda G.\r\nWallace of Indiana. At the Festival Music Hall was crowded to\r\noverflowing and Miss Susan B. Anthony was one of the guests of honor.\r\n\r\nThis year great excitement was aroused among both men and women by a\r\ncontroversy over the historical text-books used in the public schools\r\nof Boston. At the request of a priest the school board removed a\r\nhistory which the Catholics regarded as unfair in its statements, and\r\nsubstituted one which many Protestants considered equally unfair. The\r\nschool vote of women never had risen much above 2,000, and generally\r\nhad been below that number. This year 25,279 applied to be assessed a\r\npoll tax and registered, and 19,490 voted, in one of the worst storms\r\nof the season. All the Catholic candidates were defeated. The suffrage\r\nassociation kept out of the controversy as a body, but its members as\r\nindividuals took sides as their personal views dictated.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Gov. Oliver Ames, for the third time, recommended women\r\nsuffrage in his inaugural, saying: \"Recent political events have\r\nconfirmed the opinion I have long held, that if women have sufficient\r\nreason to vote they will do so and become an important factor in the\r\nsettlement of great questions. If we can trust uneducated men to vote\r\nwe can with greater safety and far more propriety grant the same power\r\nto women, who as a rule are as well educated and quite as intelligent\r\nas men.\"\r\n\r\nThe convention met January 29-31. Among outside speakers were Mrs.\r\nEllen Battelle Dietrick of Kentucky, Prof. William H. Carruth of\r\nKansas, and the Hon. Hamilton Willcox of New York. Col. Thomas\r\nWentworth Higginson presided at the May Festival and Mrs. Howe's\r\nseventieth birthday was celebrated. Mrs. Laura M. Johns of Kansas,\r\nMrs. Mary Seymour Howell of New York, Mrs. Emily P. Collins of\r\nConnecticut, and many from other States were present.\r\n\r\nAn organizer was kept in the field eight months and a State lecturer\r\ntwo months; summer meetings were held at Swampscott, Hull and\r\nNantasket. Two quarterly conferences took place in Boston between the\r\nState officers and representatives from the eighty-nine local leagues.\r\nA great Historical Pageant was given under Miss Pond's supervision in\r\nMay and October, which netted $1,582; the _Woman's Journal_ was sent\r\nfour months to all the legislators, and leaflets to all the students\r\nof Harvard and Boston Universities; 15,000 leaflets were given to the\r\nSouth Dakota campaign. The State Farmers' Institute, held at West\r\nBrookfield, adopted a woman suffrage resolution almost unanimously.\r\n\r\nIn Boston 10,051 women voted and the Catholic candidates for the\r\nschool board were again defeated. The Independent Women Voters elected\r\nall their nominees, and candidates who had the joint nomination of\r\nboth Republicans and Democrats were defeated.\r\n\r\nEx-Gov. John D. Long was one of the speakers at the convention of Jan.\r\n28, 29, 1890; also Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates of Maine. In April an\r\nevening with authors and composers was arranged, chiefly by Miss Lucia\r\nT. Ames. Well-known authors read from their writings and musicians\r\ncontributed from their own compositions. In the same month a week's\r\nfair called The Country Store was held, Miss Charlotte H. Allen\r\nsupervising the arrangements, with gross receipts, $2,346. The Rev.\r\nCharles G. Ames presided at the May Festival and the Rev. Anna Garlin\r\nSpencer of Rhode Island was one of the speakers.\r\n\r\nIn July a reception was given in the suffrage parlors to the ladies of\r\nthe National Editorial Association and the members of the New England\r\nWomen's Press Association. The editors of the _Woman's Journal_--Lucy\r\nStone, Mr. and Miss Blackwell--and the associate editor, Mrs. Florence\r\nM. Adkinson, received the guests, assisted by the Rev. Miss Shaw and\r\nMiss Lucy E. Anthony. During Grand Army week in August a reception was\r\nextended to the ladies of the Woman's Relief Corps and others, the\r\nguests received by Mrs. Livermore, Mrs. Howe, the editors of the\r\n_Journal_ and Dr. Emily Blackwell, dean of the Women's Medical College\r\nof the New York Infirmary for Women and Children.\r\n\r\nIn October the association exhibited at the Hollis Street Theater a\r\nseries of Art Tableaux, The History of Marriage, showing the marriage\r\nceremonies of different ages and countries, Mrs. Livermore acting as\r\nhistorian. The receipts were $1,463. The association sent literature\r\nto the legislators, to several thousand college students and to all\r\nthe members of the Mississippi Constitutional Convention; had a booth\r\nfor two months at the Mechanics' Fair in Boston; supplied suffrage\r\nmatter every week to 603 editors in all parts of the country and gave\r\n133,334 pages of leaflets to the campaign in South Dakota. The\r\nchairman of its executive committee, Mrs. Stone, also donated 95,000\r\ncopies of the _Woman's Column_ to the same campaign, and the\r\nsecretary, Mr. Blackwell, contributed five weeks' gratuitous service\r\nin Dakota, lecturing for the amendment.\r\n\r\nThe Boston Methodist ministers, at their Monday meeting, passed\r\nunanimously a resolution in favor of Municipal Woman Suffrage; and a\r\ngathering of Massachusetts farmers, at the rooms of the _Ploughman_,\r\ndid the same with only one dissenting vote, after an address by Lucy\r\nStone, herself a farmer's daughter.[307]\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting, Jan. 27, 28, 1891, was made a celebration of the\r\nfortieth anniversary of the First National Woman's Rights Convention,\r\nwhich had been held at Worcester in October, 1850. Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony came on from Washington to attend. The advance of women in\r\ndifferent lines during the past forty years was ably reviewed\r\nin the addresses by representative women in their respective\r\ndepartments.[308] Only two of the speakers at the convention of forty\r\nyears ago were present on this occasion, Lucy Stone and the Rev.\r\nAntoinette Brown Blackwell; and two who had signed the Call--Colonel\r\nHigginson and Charles K. Whipple. The resolutions were reaffirmed\r\nwhich had been reported by Wendell Phillips and adopted at the\r\nconvention of 1850. At this time Mrs. Howe was elected president of\r\nthe State association.\r\n\r\nThe New England meeting in May was preceded by a reception to Miss\r\nAnthony, the Rev. Miss Shaw and Miss Florence Balgarnie of England,\r\nall of whom made addresses at the convention and the Festival, where\r\nex-Governor Long presided.\r\n\r\nThe meetings this year included a number of college towns and among\r\nthe speakers were Senator Hoar, Mr. Garrison, Mr. Blackwell, Mrs.\r\nLivermore, Mrs. Howe and Mrs. Stone, with the younger women, Mrs. Anna\r\nChristy Fall, Mrs. Adelaide A. Claflin, Miss Elizabeth Sheldon\r\n(Tillinghast), Miss Elizabeth Deering Hanscom. At Amherst a large\r\ngathering of students listened to Senator Hoar. President and Mrs.\r\nMerrill E. Gates occupied seats on the platform. At South Hadley\r\nPresident Elizabeth Storrs Mead of Mt. Holyoke entertained all the\r\nspeakers at the college, and at Northampton it was estimated by the\r\ndaily papers that 500 Smith College girls came to the meeting.\r\n\r\nOn October 21 the association gave a reception to Theodore D. Weld in\r\nhonor of his eighty-eighth birthday. This date was the anniversary of\r\nthe famous mob of 1835, which attacked the meeting of the Boston\r\nFemale Anti-Slavery Society. Later a reception was tendered to Mrs.\r\nAnnie Besant of the London School Board. On November 17, during the\r\nweek when the W. C. T. U. held its national convention in Boston, a\r\nreception was given in the suffrage parlors to all interested in the\r\nFranchise Department. A special invitation was issued to White\r\nRibboners from the Southern States where none was yet adopted, and the\r\nspacious rooms were filled to overflowing. Lucy Stone presided and\r\nJulia Ward Howe gave the address of welcome. Many brief responses were\r\nmade by the Southern delegates and by Northern delegates and friends.\r\n\r\nIn December a suffrage fair was held under the management of Mrs.\r\nDietrick, now of Boston, which netted $1,800. Senator Hoar's speech at\r\nAmherst was sent to the students of all the colleges in the State.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting Jan. 26, 27, 1892, the Rev. Joseph Cook gave an\r\naddress. Lucy Stone presided at the New England convention and Mrs.\r\nHowe at the Festival. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt was the speaker from a\r\ndistance. Letters were read from the Hon. Thomas B. Reed, Terence V.\r\nPowderly and U. S. Senators Joseph M. Carey and Francis E. Warren of\r\nWyoming.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usual work this year $200 were offered in $5 prizes\r\nto the children of the public schools for the best essays in favor of\r\nwoman suffrage. Mrs. Dietrick was employed for six months as State\r\norganizer. An appeal for equal suffrage signed by Mrs. Stone, Mrs.\r\nHowe and Mrs. Livermore was sent to editors throughout the State with\r\nthe request to publish it and to indorse it editorially, which was\r\ndone by many. A letter signed by the same was sent to every minister\r\nin Boston asking him either to present the subject to his congregation\r\nor permit it to be presented by some one else, and a number consented.\r\n\r\nA Woman's Day was held at the State Agricultural Fair in Worcester,\r\nwhen it was estimated 70,000 people were present. Col. Daniel Needham,\r\npresident of the Fair, expressed himself as thankful for the\r\nopportunity to welcome woman suffrage. Mrs. Rufus S. Frost, Lucy\r\nStone, Mrs. Livermore, Mrs. Claflin and Mr. Blackwell were the\r\nspeakers. When a vote was taken at the close, the whole audience rose\r\nin favor of suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe Independent Women Voters of Boston again elected their entire\r\nschool ticket. Miss Frances E. Willard and Mrs. Claflin addressed the\r\nWorking Girls' Clubs of the State on suffrage at their annual reunion\r\nin Boston. The association was represented at the great farewell\r\nreception to Lady Henry Somerset, Lucy Stone presenting her with\r\ntwenty-three yellow roses for the States with School Suffrage and one\r\npure white for Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThis year at a special meeting the association amended the old\r\nconstitution under which it had been working since 1870, and\r\nunanimously adopted a delegate basis of representation.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting was held Dec. 6, 7, 1892, instead of January, 1893.\r\nMrs. Howe presided and addresses were made by Mrs. Stone, Mrs.\r\nLivermore, the Hon. George A. O. Ernst, Mrs. Estelle M. H. Merrill,\r\npresident of the New England Women's Press Association, and others.\r\nLucy Stone was elected president and superintendents were instituted\r\nfor different departments of work.\r\n\r\nAt a gathering of Massachusetts farmers in Boston, Lucy Stone and Mrs.\r\nOlive Wright of Denver, spoke for woman suffrage; the meeting declared\r\nfor it unanimously by a rising vote and every farmer present signed\r\nthe petition. The State Grange, at its annual convention, adopted a\r\nstrong suffrage resolution by 96 yeas, 27 nays. The Unitarian\r\nMinisters' Monday Club of Boston, after an address by Mrs. Stone, did\r\nthe same, and every minister present but one signed the petition. The\r\nUniversalist Ministers' Monday meeting in Boston, at her request,\r\nvoted by a large majority to memorialize the Legislature for woman\r\nsuffrage. The Central Labor Union took similar action. The Boston\r\n_Transcript_, _Globe_, _Advertiser_, _Traveller and Beacon_, the\r\nSpringfield _Republican_, Greenfield _Gazette and Courier_, Salem\r\n_Observer_, Salem _Register_ and many other papers supported the\r\nMunicipal Suffrage Bill which was then pending.\r\n\r\nAt the May Festival of 1893 Senator Hoar presided and 900 persons sat\r\ndown to the banquet. Mrs. Laura Ormiston Chant of England, and Miss\r\nKirstine Frederiksen of Denmark, were the speakers from abroad. A\r\nreception to these ladies preceded the annual meeting of the New\r\nEngland Association. Mme. Marie Marshall of Paris, was added to the\r\nabove speakers, also Wendell Phillips Stafford of Vermont, Mrs. Ellen\r\nM. Bolles of Rhode Island, and others. On June 5 a reception was given\r\nto Mrs. Jane Cobden Unwin of London, Richard Cobden's daughter. On\r\nJuly 19, by invitation of the Waltham Suffrage Club, the State\r\nassociation and the local leagues united in a basket picnic at Forest\r\nGrove. On this occasion Lucy Stone made her last public address.\r\n\r\nWoman's Day at the New England Agricultural Fair in Worcester was\r\nobserved in September with addresses by Mrs. Chant, Mrs. Livermore,\r\nMrs. Fanny Purdy Palmer and Mr. Blackwell, representing Lucy Stone,\r\nwho was too ill to be present. There was a very large audience. Part\r\nof a day was also secured at the Marshfield Fair with an address by\r\nMrs. Katherine Lente Stevenson. A convention was held at Westfield,\r\nOctober 2, when the opera house was crowded to hear Mrs. Livermore.\r\n\r\nMr. Blackwell presented a resolution in favor of Municipal Suffrage\r\nfor women in the Resolutions Committee of the Republican State\r\nConvention, October 6. It was warmly advocated by the Hon. John D.\r\nLong, Samuel Walker McCall, M. C., Mayor Fairbanks of Quincy, and\r\nothers, and would possibly have been passed but for the strenuous\r\nopposition of the chairman, ex-Gov. George D. Robinson, who said he\r\nwould decline to read the platform to the convention if the resolution\r\nwas adopted. It was finally lost by 4 yeas, 7 nays.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 18, 1893, occurred the death of Lucy Stone at her home in\r\nDorchester. She said with calm contentment, \"I have done what I wanted\r\nto do; I have helped the women.\" Her last whispered words to her\r\ndaughter were, \"Make the world better.\" The funeral was held in James\r\nFreeman Clarke's old church in Boston. Hundreds of people stood\r\nwaiting silently in the street before the doors were opened. The Rev.\r\nCharles G. Ames said afterward that, \"the services were not like a\r\nfuneral but like a solemn celebration and a coronation.\" The speakers\r\nwere Mr. Ames, Colonel Higginson, Mrs. Livermore, Mr. Garrison, Mrs.\r\nCheney, the Rev. Samuel J. Barrows, Mrs. Chant, the Rev. Anna Garlin\r\nSpencer of Providence, Mary Grew of Philadelphia, with a poem by Mrs.\r\nHowe. A strong impetus was given to the suffrage movement by the wide\r\npublication in the papers of the facts of Lucy Stone's simple and\r\nnoble life, and by the universal expression of affection and regret. A\r\nlife-long opponent declared that the death of no woman in America had\r\never called out so general a tribute of public respect and esteem.\r\n\r\nThe State association again held its annual meeting in December. Among\r\nthe resolutions adopted was the following:\r\n\r\n     In the passing away of Lucy Stone, our president, the beloved\r\n     pioneer of woman suffrage, who has been, ever since 1847, its\r\n     mainstay and unfailing champion, the cause of equal rights in\r\n     this State and throughout the Union has suffered an irreparable\r\n     loss.\r\n\r\nHer daughter closed the report of the year's work by saying: \"Let all\r\nthose who held her dear show their regard for her memory in the way\r\nthat would have pleased and touched her most--by doing their best to\r\nhelp forward the cause she loved so well.\"\r\n\r\nMrs. Mary A. Livermore was elected president.\r\n\r\nOn December 16 the association celebrated in Faneuil Hall the one\r\nhundred and twentieth anniversary of the Boston Tea Party. One of the\r\nlast expressed wishes of Lucy Stone had been that the celebration\r\nshould take place in the Old South Church, but the use of this\r\nhistoric building was refused by the trustees, much to the\r\nmortification of the more liberal members of the General Committee of\r\nthe Old South. Colonel Higginson, who had presided at the centennial\r\ncelebration of the same event by the suffragists twenty years before,\r\nagain presided and made the opening address. Other speakers were Mrs.\r\nChapman Catt and Wendell Phillips Stafford. Mr. Garrison gave a poem\r\nand Mr. Blackwell read the speech made by Lucy Stone at the\r\ncelebration in 1873. Letters were read from Senator Hoar, Frederick\r\nDouglass and others. Governor-elect Frederick T. Greenhalge and Lieut.\r\nGov.-elect Roger Wolcott occupied seats on the platform.\r\n\r\nThis year the Massachusetts W. S. A. had become incorporated. It had\r\nsent suffrage literature to all the Episcopalian, Unitarian and\r\nUniversalist clergymen in the State, to most of the Methodist\r\nministers, to 1,100 public school teachers and to a large number of\r\ncollege students. Its president, Lucy Stone, had sent, from her death\r\nbed, the largest contribution to the Colorado campaign given by any\r\nindividual outside of that State. Its secretary, Mr. Blackwell, had\r\nattended the National Convention of Republican Clubs at Louisville,\r\nKy., and secured the adoption of the following resolution: \"We\r\nrecommend to the favorable consideration of the Republican Clubs of\r\nthe United States, as a matter of education, the question of granting\r\nto the women of the State and nation the right to vote at all\r\nelections on the same terms and conditions as male citizens.\"\r\n\r\nA thousand copies of William I. Bowditch's Taxation Without\r\nRepresentation and George Pellew's Woman and the Commonwealth were\r\nbound and presented to town and college libraries. Mayor Nathan\r\nMatthews, Jr., of Boston appointed two women on the Board of Overseers\r\nof the Poor, despite the strong opposition of the aldermen. He also\r\nappointed three women members of a commission to investigate and\r\nreport to him upon the condition of public institutions. Toward the\r\nend of the year he again appointed two women on a similar committee,\r\nincluding one of those who served before. The Hon. George S. Hale\r\nsaid at the annual suffrage meeting, \"Both ladies are admirably\r\nqualified, and the one who acted last year is declared by all the men\r\nwho served with her to be the most valuable member of the board.\"\r\n\r\nOut of 622 students and professors at Wellesley College, who were\r\nquestioned as to their views on suffrage, 506 declared themselves in\r\nfavor, and 500 of them united in sending a telegram of congratulation\r\nto the women of Colorado on the passage of the equal suffrage\r\namendment this year. (1893.)\r\n\r\nAt the May Festival 1,000 sat down to the banquet and hundreds\r\noccupied the balconies. Ex-Governor Long presided. One of the speakers\r\nwas Robert S. Gray, chairman of the Committee on Woman Suffrage in the\r\nLegislature. In honor of Mrs. Howe's seventy-fifth birthday Mrs. Alice\r\nJ. Harris sang The Battle Hymn of the Republic, the audience joining\r\nin the chorus.\r\n\r\nOn June 18 delegates from many labor organizations met in Boston, in\r\nresponse to a call from the Boston Workingmen's Political League, and\r\ndecided to act together at the ballot box. Their platform demanded\r\nuniversal suffrage irrespective of sex.\r\n\r\nLucy Stone mite-boxes were circulated by the association for funds to\r\naid the amendment campaign in Kansas. Mr. Blackwell attended the\r\nNational Convention of Republican Clubs held in Denver. On June 27 it\r\nreiterated the woman suffrage resolution it had passed the year before\r\nin Louisville.\r\n\r\nOn July 24 Woman's Day was celebrated at the Massachusetts Chautauqua\r\nin South Framingham, with many able speakers. On September 4 Woman's\r\nDay was observed at the New England Agricultural Fair in Worcester.\r\nColonel Needham, its president, made an earnest woman suffrage address\r\nand was followed by Mrs. Howe, Miss Yates, Mrs. Mary Sargent Hopkins\r\nand Mr. Blackwell. In December a suffrage fair was held under the\r\nmanagement of Mrs. Abby M. Davis which cleared about $1,800. On the\r\nopening night Mrs. Cheney presided and there were addresses by Lady\r\nHenry Somerset and Miss Frances E. Willard.\r\n\r\nThis year the association kept the papers supplied with suffrage\r\narticles more thoroughly than ever before; had speakers present the\r\nsubject to thirty-one women's clubs; furnished literature to the\r\nlegislators, to 5,000 public school teachers, to all the\r\nCongregational ministers in the State and to many of other\r\ndenominations; and sent 3,782 leaflets to college students and\r\ngraduates.\r\n\r\nGovernor Greenhalge in his inaugural in 1895, said, \"I hold to the\r\nviews expressed in the message of last year as to the extension of\r\nMunicipal Suffrage to women.\" He also referred to it favorably in an\r\naddress before the New England Women's Press Association, and at the\r\nParliament of Man held in Boston.\r\n\r\nMrs. Livermore presided at the annual meeting, January 8, 9. Mrs.\r\nHelen H. Gardiner and Representative Alfred S. Roe were among the\r\nspeakers. From this time date the Fortnightly Meetings at the suffrage\r\nheadquarters, and these have been held ever since except during the\r\nsummer vacations. They are usually well attended and seldom fail to\r\nhave some speaker of note.\r\n\r\nOn May 4 Mr. Blackwell's seventieth birthday was celebrated by a\r\nreception and dinner at Copley Square Hotel, Boston, ex-Governor Long\r\npresiding. A newspaper said, \"The guests on this occasion represented\r\nthe conscience and culture of New England.\" Addresses were made by\r\nmany of his co-workers,[309] and among those who sent letters were the\r\nRev. Samuel May, Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Ainsworth R. Spofford,\r\nof the Library of Congress, Ex-Governor Claflin, Mrs. J. Ellen Foster,\r\nthe Hon. James L. Hughes, president of the Equal Rights Association of\r\nToronto, Professor and Mrs. Carruth of Kansas University, and others.\r\nOn May 14 the golden wedding of the Rev. D. P. and Mrs. Livermore was\r\ncelebrated by a reception in the suffrage parlors. Their daughters,\r\nson-in-law and grandchildren received with them. In accordance with\r\nMrs. Livermore's wish there was no speaking but a great throng of\r\ndistinguished guests, including both suffragists and \"antis,\" were\r\npresent.\r\n\r\nAt the May Anniversary a reception was given to Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi\r\nof New York, and Miss Elizabeth Burrill Curtis, daughter of the\r\nstaunch advocate of suffrage, George William Curtis. Mr. Blackwell\r\npresided at the Festival in Music Hall and 700 sat down to the\r\nbanquet.\r\n\r\nWoman suffrage was indorsed by the Garment Makers' Union of Boston,\r\nwith its 400 members. This year a long list of prominent persons\r\nsigned a published statement declaring themselves in favor, all the\r\nnames being collected within about a week. This remarkable list\r\nincluded several hundred names, about one-third of men. So far as\r\npersonal achievement goes they were among the most prominent in the\r\nState and included several presidents of colleges, a large number of\r\nnoted university men, public officials, lawyers, editors, etc. Among\r\nthe women were the president, dean and twenty professors of Wellesley\r\nCollege; the director of the Observatory and six instructors of Smith\r\nCollege, physicians, lawyers, authors, large taxpayers, and many noted\r\nfor philanthropy.[310]\r\n\r\nThe association secured a Woman's Day at the New England Chautauqua\r\nAssembly; brought the question before hundreds at parlor meetings and\r\npublic debates, outside of the many arranged by the Referendum\r\nCommittee; published six leaflets and a volume, The Legal Status of\r\nWomen in Massachusetts, by Mr. Ernst, and distributed an immense\r\namount of literature.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the anti-suffrage associations organized in\r\nMassachusetts always had gone to pieces within a short period after\r\nthey were formed. But in May, 1895, the present Association Opposed to\r\nthe Further Extension of Suffrage to Women was organized, with Mrs.\r\nJames M. Codman at its head and Mrs. Charles E. Guild as secretary.\r\nThis was a society composed of women alone. Col. Higginson said in\r\n_Harper's Bazar_:\r\n\r\n     All the ladies move in a limited though most unimpeachable\r\n     circle. All may be presumed to interchange visiting cards and\r\n     meet at the same afternoon teas. There is not even a hint that\r\n     there is any other class to be consulted. Where are the literary\r\n     women, the artists, the teachers, the business women, the\r\n     temperance women, the labor reform advocates, the members of the\r\n     farmers' grange, the clergymen's wives? Compared with this\r\n     inadequate body how comfortably varied looks the list of the\r\n     committee in behalf of woman suffrage. [Distinguished names\r\n     given.] It includes also women who are wholesomely unknown to the\r\n     world at large but well known in the granges and among the\r\n     Christian Endeavorers. Can any one doubt which list represents\r\n     the spirit of the future?\r\n\r\n     The more cultivated social class--the \"Four Hundred,\" as the\r\n     saying is--have an immense value in certain directions. They\r\n     stand for the social amenities and in many ways for the worthy\r\n     charities. Generous and noble traditions attach to their names\r\n     and nowhere more than in Boston. But one thing has in all ages\r\n     and places been denied to this class--that of leadership in bold\r\n     reforms.\r\n\r\nOn November 5 the mock referendum, which had been opposed by many of\r\nthe leading suffragists, was voted on and received a large negative\r\nmajority. (See Legislative Action.)\r\n\r\nThe State association held its annual convention, Jan. 14, 15, 1896,\r\nwith large audiences. It opened with a Young People's Meeting, Miss\r\nBlackwell presiding.[311] The Rev. Father Scully and Mrs. Fanny B.\r\nAmes, State Factory Inspector, were among the many who gave addresses.\r\nAt the business meeting the following resolution on the mock\r\nreferendum was adopted:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, The returns show that we only need to convert twenty per\r\n     cent. of the male voters in order to have a majority; and\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Public sentiment is growing rapidly and grows faster the\r\n     more the subject is discussed; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That we petition the Legislature to give us a real\r\n     instead of a sham referendum, by submitting to the voters a\r\n     constitutional amendment enfranchising women.\r\n\r\nThe president, Mrs. Livermore, was made a Doctor of Laws by Tufts\r\nCollege and was given a great birthday reception by her\r\nfellow-townsmen, with addresses by Mrs. Susan S. Fessenden and Mr.\r\nBlackwell and a poem by Hezekiah Butterworth.\r\n\r\nThe May Festival also opened with a Young People's Meeting, Mrs. Howe\r\nas \"grandmother\" introducing the speakers.[312] Mr. Garrison presided\r\nat the Festival and the speakers included Alfred Webb, M. P., of\r\nDublin, the Rev. Dean Hodges, of the Episcopal Theological School,\r\nMrs. Charlotte Perkins Stetson and Prof. Ellen Hayes of Wellesley.\r\n\r\nA series of meetings was held this year in Berkshire County. Mrs. Mary\r\nClarke Smith was kept in the field as State organizer for seven\r\nmonths. A speaker was sent free of charge to every woman's club or\r\nother society willing to hear the suffrage question presented; 13,000\r\npages of literature were distributed. On October 27 the State Baptist\r\nYoung People's Union at its anniversary indorsed woman suffrage. In\r\nDecember a rousing meeting was held in Canton, Congressman Elijah\r\nMorse presiding, with Mrs. Livermore and Miss Yates as speakers.\r\n\r\nAmong the deaths of the year was that of Frederick T. Greenhalge--the\r\nlatest of a long line of Massachusetts governors who have advocated\r\nwoman suffrage since 1870--Governors Claflin, Washburn, Talbot,\r\nBrackett, Long, Butler and Ames.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting, in 1897, the speakers included the Rev. George\r\nL. Perin and Augusta Chapin, D. D. As the laws were about to be\r\nrevised and codified it was decided to ask for an equalization of\r\nthose bearing on domestic relations. The _Women's Journal_ noted that\r\nnever before had so many petitions for suffrage been sent in within so\r\nshort a time. On February 16 the association gave a large and\r\nbrilliant reception at the Vendome to Miss Jane Addams of Chicago.\r\nCol. Higginson presided, and Miss Addams, Mrs. Howe and Mrs. Livermore\r\nspoke. On April 17 a reception was given in the suffrage parlors to\r\nMrs. Harriet Tubman, the colored woman so noted in anti-slavery days\r\nfor her assistance to fugitive slaves, Mrs. Ednah D. Cheney assisting.\r\n\r\nMr. Blackwell presided at the Festival, May 27, and eloquent addresses\r\nwere made by the Rev. Dr. George C. Lorimer, Lieutenant-Governor John\r\nL. Bates, Mrs. Florence Howe Hall and many others, while letters of\r\ngreeting were read from Lady Henry Somerset and Mrs. Millicent Garrett\r\nFawcett of England. It was Mrs. Howe's seventy-eighth birthday and she\r\nwas received with cheers and presented with flowers.\r\n\r\nOn July 29 the annual meeting of the Berkshire Historical and\r\nScientific Society, held at Adams, was \"a woman suffrage convention\r\nfrom end to end,\" with Miss Susan B. Anthony as the guest of honor in\r\nher native town. Her friends and relatives from all parts of the\r\ncountry were present and addresses were made by the vice-president of\r\nthe society, the Rev. A. B. Whipple, by Miss Shaw, Mrs. Chapman Catt,\r\nMrs. Rachel Foster Avery, Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton and Miss\r\nBlackwell, officers of the National Suffrage Association, and by Mrs.\r\nMay Wright Sewall, vice-president of the International Council of\r\nWomen, Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby, editor of the _Woman's Tribune_ and\r\nMrs. Ida Husted Harper, Miss Anthony's biographer.\r\n\r\nThe Prohibition State Convention in September resolved that\r\n\"educational qualifications and not sex should be the test of the\r\nelective franchise.\" The next year it adopted a woman suffrage plank.\r\n\r\nIn December the association held a bazar under the management of Miss\r\nHarriet E. Turner which cleared $3,200. During the year the usual\r\nlarge amount of educational work was done, which included 1,024\r\nsuffrage articles furnished to 230 newspapers, and the holding of 176\r\npublic meetings. The New England Historical and Genealogical Society\r\nvoted unanimously to admit women to membership. Strong efforts were\r\nmade to have the Boston school board elect several eminently qualified\r\nwomen as submasters, but sex prejudice defeated them.\r\n\r\nThe Anti-Suffrage Association published an anonymous pamphlet entitled\r\nTested by its Fruits. The Massachusetts W. S. A. published a\r\ncounter-pamphlet by Chief-Justice Groesbeck of Wyoming, who testified\r\nthat some of the laws which it represented as then in force had been\r\nrepealed many years before, and that upon some \"an absurd\r\nconstruction\" had been placed.\r\n\r\nThe convention of Jan. 26, 1898, was addressed by J. M. Robertson of\r\nEngland. At the May Festival in Hotel Brunswick, the Hon. Hugh H. Lusk\r\nof New Zealand gave an address, and the occasion was made noteworthy\r\nby bright speeches from young women--Mrs. Helen Adelaide Shaw, Miss\r\nMaud Wood (Park) of Radcliffe and Miss Hanscom of Boston University\r\nand Smith College. Several members of the Legislature spoke and\r\nreports were received from all the New England States.\r\n\r\nWoman's Day was celebrated at the Mechanics' Fair in Boston. This year\r\nthe association began to issue a monthly letter to the local leagues.\r\nAs an addition to the literature, Secretary-of-the-Navy John D. Long's\r\nsuffrage address with his portrait was issued as a handsome pamphlet.\r\nIn response to an appeal from the president, Mrs. Livermore (so well\r\nknown through the Sanitary Commission during the Civil War), $500 and\r\nmany boxes of supplies were sent to the soldiers in the\r\nSpanish-American War, and the secretary of the State association,\r\nMrs. Ellie A. Hilt, literally worked herself to death in this service.\r\n\r\nThe usual meetings were held in 1899 and 1900 and the same great\r\namount of work was done. To increase the school vote of women in 1899\r\nthirty-eight public meetings were held by the association, with the\r\nresult that in Boston 3,000 new names were added to the registration\r\nlist. In 1900 the association contributed liberally to the suffrage\r\ncampaign in Oregon. A large and brilliant reception was given at the\r\nHotel Vendome in honor of Mrs. Livermore's 80th birthday.\r\n\r\nPresidents of the State association since 1883 have been the Hon.\r\nWilliam I. Bowditch (1878) to 1891; Mrs. Julia Ward Howe to 1893; Mrs.\r\nLucy Stone elected that year but died in October; Mrs. Mary A.\r\nLivermore, 1893 and still in office. Henry B. Blackwell has been\r\ncorresponding secretary over thirty years.[313]\r\n\r\nThe first president of the New England association was Mrs. Howe. In\r\n1877 Mrs. Lucy Stone was elected, and at her death in 1893 Mrs. Howe\r\nwas again chosen and is still serving.[314]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION:[315] The first petition for the rights of women\r\nwas presented to the Legislature by William Lloyd Garrison in 1849. In\r\n1853 Lucy Stone, Theodore Parker, Wendell Phillips and Thomas\r\nWentworth Higginson went before the constitutional convention held in\r\nthe State House, with a petition signed by 2,000 names, and pleaded\r\nfor an amendment conferring suffrage on women.\r\n\r\nThe first appearance of a woman in this State before a legislative\r\ncommittee was made in 1857, when Lucy Stone, with the Rev. James\r\nFreeman Clarke and Mr. Phillips, addressed the House Judiciary asking\r\nsuffrage for women and equal property rights for wives. The next year\r\nSamuel E. Sewall and Dr. Harriot K. Hunt were granted a similar\r\nhearing. In 1869, through the efforts of the New England Suffrage\r\nAssociation, two hearings were secured to present the claims of 8,000\r\nwomen who had petitioned for the franchise on the same terms as men.\r\nThis was the beginning of annual hearings on this question, which have\r\nbeen continued without intermission for over thirty years. Henry B.\r\nBlackwell has spoken at every hearing and Lucy Stone at every one\r\nuntil her death.\r\n\r\n_1884_--Petitions were presented for Municipal Suffrage, for the\r\nappointment of police matrons; also for laws permitting husbands and\r\nwives to contract with each other and make gifts directly to each\r\nother; allowing a woman to hold any office to which she might be\r\nelected or appointed; and requiring that a certain number of women\r\nshould be appointed on Boards of Overseers of the Poor, on State\r\nBoards of Charities and as physicians in the women's wards of insane\r\nasylums. Hearings were given on most of these petitions. At that of\r\nJanuary 25 for Municipal Suffrage the speakers were William I.\r\nBowditch, Mrs. Stone, Mr. Blackwell, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, Mrs. Ednah\r\nD. Cheney, the Rev. J. W. and Mrs. Jennie F. Bashford, Mary F.\r\nEastman, Mrs. H. H. Robinson, Mrs. Harriette Robinson Shattuck and\r\nMiss Nancy Covell.\r\n\r\nOn January 29 a hearing was given to the remonstrants conducted by\r\nThornton K. Lothrop. The speakers were Francis Parkman (whose paper\r\nwas read for him by Mr. Lothrop) Louis B. Brandeis, Mrs. Kate Gannett\r\nWells, William H. Sayward, Mrs. Lydia Warner and George C. Crocker. A\r\nletter was read from Mrs. Clara T. Leonard. Mr. Parkman asserted that\r\nthe suffragists \"have thrown to the wind every political, not to say\r\nevery moral principle;\" that \"three-fourths of the agitators are in\r\nmutiny against Providence because it made them women;\" and that \"if\r\nthe ballot were granted to women it would be a burden so crushing that\r\nlife would be a misery.\"\r\n\r\nThis year 315 petitions for suffrage with 21,608 signatures were\r\npresented. The remonstrants who set out with the avowed intention of\r\ngetting more secured about 3,000. A number of persons who signed the\r\nanti-suffrage petition in Boston published letters afterwards over\r\ntheir own names and addresses saying that they had signed without\r\nreading, upon the assurance of the canvasser employed by the\r\nremonstrants that it was a petition to permit women to vote on the\r\nquestion of liquor license.\r\n\r\nIn the House Municipal Suffrage was discussed March 12, 13, and\r\nfinally was defeated by 61 yeas, 155 nays. A bill to let women vote on\r\nthe license question, which had not been asked for by the suffrage\r\nassociation, was voted down without a count.\r\n\r\nA law was enacted requiring two women trustees on the board of every\r\nState lunatic hospital, and one woman physician in each. Samuel E.\r\nSewall, Frank B. Sanborn, Mr. Blackwell and Miss Mary A. Brigham had\r\nbeen the speakers at the hearing in behalf of this measure. All the\r\nother petitions were refused.\r\n\r\n_1885_--On Municipal Suffrage and the submission of a constitutional\r\namendment a hearing was given February 17. As usual the Green Room was\r\ncrowded. There were before the committee petitions for suffrage with\r\n16,113 signatures, and petitions against it with 285. The speakers in\r\nfavor were the Rev. James Freeman Clarke, Mrs. Cheney, Lucy Stone, Mr.\r\nBlackwell, Mr. Bowditch, William Lloyd Garrison, Jr., Miss Eastman,\r\nMrs. Adelaide A. Claflin, Mrs. Abby M. Gannett and Miss Lelia J.\r\nRobinson. The opposition was conducted by Mr. Brandeis and the\r\nspeakers were Judge Francis C. Lowell, Mrs. Gannett Wells, Thomas\r\nWeston, Jr., Henry Parkman and the Rev. Brooke Hereford, lately from\r\nEngland, with letters from President L. Clark Seelye of Smith College,\r\nMiss Mary E. Dewey and Mr. Sayward. The committee reported in favor of\r\nMunicipal Suffrage with only one dissenting. The House on May 4\r\nrejected the bill by 61 yeas, 131 nays.\r\n\r\nWhile the women sat in the gallery waiting for the measure to be\r\ndiscussed, the bill proposing to limit the working day for women and\r\nchildren to ten hours was \"guyed, laughed at and voted down amid\r\nridicule and uproar.\" This Legislature also refused the petition of\r\nMr. Sewall and others for one or more women on every Board of\r\nOverseers of the Poor; for the better protection of wives; for the\r\nsubmission of a constitutional amendment granting women full suffrage;\r\nand for the amendment of the school suffrage law to make it as easy\r\nfor women as for men to register. (See Suffrage.)\r\n\r\n_1886_--At the hearing, January 28, a letter was read from the Hon.\r\nJosiah G. Abbott, and addresses were made by Mr. Garrison, Lucy Stone,\r\nMr. Blackwell, Mrs. Cheney, Mrs. Eliza Trask Hill, the Rev. Ada C.\r\nBowles, Mrs. Shattuck, Mrs. Robinson, Miss Eastman and Mrs. Claflin.\r\nThe remonstrants' hearing had been appointed for January 29. Their\r\nattorney, E. N. Hill, tried at the last moment to get a postponement\r\nbut failed. The leaders of the \"antis\" declined to speak but several\r\nof the rank and file appeared and made the usual objections. The\r\ncommittee reported in favor of Municipal Suffrage. It was discussed in\r\nthe House April 14, about the same number speaking on each side, and\r\ndefeated by 77 yeas, 132 nays, the most favorable vote since 1879.\r\n\r\nOn May 20, before the Senate Judiciary Committee, representatives of\r\nthe suffrage association and other societies had a hearing in behalf\r\nof bills to raise the \"age of protection\" and to provide adequate\r\npenalties for seduction, but no action was taken.\r\n\r\n_1887_--On January 6 Governor Oliver Ames, in his inaugural address to\r\nthe Legislature, said, \"I earnestly recommend, as a measure of simple\r\njustice, the enactment of a law securing Municipal Suffrage to women.\"\r\nThe suffrage petitions this year had 5,741 signatures, the remonstrant\r\npetitions 81. On February 2 it was ordered in the House, on motion of\r\nJosiah Quincy, that the Committee on Woman Suffrage consider the\r\nexpediency of submitting the question of Municipal Suffrage to the\r\nwomen of the different cities and towns, the right to be given to them\r\nin any city or town where the majority of those who voted on the\r\nquestion should vote in favor; or where a number of women should\r\npetition for it equal to a majority of the number of men who voted at\r\nthe last annual municipal or town election; or where a majority vote\r\nof the men should be given for it at the annual election.\r\n\r\nOn motion of Mr. Quincy an order for legislation to equalize the\r\ninterest of husbands and wives in each other's property had been\r\npreviously introduced but was lost.\r\n\r\nOn February 9 a hearing was given to the petitioners. The speakers\r\nwere the same as the previous year with the addition of Col. T. W.\r\nHigginson. Mr. Blackwell presented two letters in favor of the bill,\r\none addressed to Republicans, one to Democrats.[316] Clement K. Fay\r\nspoke for the remonstrants.\r\n\r\nThe committee reported in favor of Municipal Suffrage, two dissenting.\r\nIt was discussed in the House March 3 and 10. Mr. Bailey of Everett\r\noffered an amendment that the provisions of the bill be tried for ten\r\nyears, but it was not put to a vote. The bill was lost by 86 yeas, 122\r\nnays, including pairs.\r\n\r\nA bill to let women vote on the license question passed the House by\r\n116 yeas to 88 nays, including pairs, but was defeated in the Senate,\r\n24 yeas, 13 nays.\r\n\r\nThe bill was passed providing for police matrons in all cities of\r\n30,000 or more inhabitants.\r\n\r\n_1888_--The Legislature was asked for Municipal and Presidential\r\nSuffrage and for the submission of a constitutional amendment; also\r\nfor various improvements in the laws relating to women. The Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union petitioned for License Suffrage. Several\r\nthousand women signed the petition and one hundred the remonstrance.\r\nOn January 25 a hearing was given on the petitions for Municipal and\r\nLicense Suffrage. Mr. Bowditch, Lucy Stone, Mr. Blackwell, Mrs. Howe\r\nand Mrs. Cheney spoke for Municipal Suffrage and Miss Elizabeth S.\r\nTobey for License Suffrage. Mr. Brandeis made an argument as attorney\r\nfor the remonstrants. Charles Carleton Coffin, A. A. Miner, D. D.,\r\nMrs. Claflin, the Rev. Ada C. Bowles and Miss Cora Scott Pond replied\r\nfor the petitioners.\r\n\r\nOn February 20 and 25 hearings were given on the petitions for six\r\nbills drawn by Mr. Sewall: 1. To give mothers the equal care, custody\r\nand education of their minor children. 2. To give married women a\r\nright to appoint guardians for their minor children by will. 3. To\r\nrepeal the act of 1887 limiting the inheritance of personal property.\r\n4. To regulate and equalize the descent of personal property between\r\nhusband and wife. 5. To equalize curtesy and dower and the descent of\r\nreal estate between husband and wife. 6. To enable husbands and wives\r\nto make gifts, contracts and conveyances directly with one another,\r\nand to authorize suits between them.\r\n\r\nAddresses in support of the petitions were made by Mr. Sewall, Mrs.\r\nHowe, Mrs. Stone, Mr. Blackwell, the Hon. George A. O. Ernst, Miss\r\nRobinson, George H. Fall and others. All these measures were refused.\r\nSeveral new statutes for the better protection of women were passed\r\nthis year, however, at the instance of Mr. Sewall, among them one\r\nproviding severe penalties for any person who should aid in sending a\r\nwoman as inmate or servant to a house of ill fame; one prohibiting\r\nrailroads from requiring women or children to ride in smoking cars;\r\none providing that women arrested should be placed in charge of police\r\nmatrons.\r\n\r\nOn April 23 Municipal Suffrage was defeated in the House, 50 yeas, 121\r\nnays. License Suffrage, after a prolonged contest, passed by 118 yeas,\r\n110 nays, and was defeated in the Senate, 20 yeas, 19 nays.\r\n\r\n_1889_--At the hearing of January 31 the attendance was larger than\r\never before. Prof. W. H. Carruth, Franklyn Howland and the Rev. J. W.\r\nHamilton (afterwards Bishop of the Methodist Episcopal Church) were\r\nadded to the usual list of speakers.\r\n\r\nOn February 4 a hearing was granted to the W. C. T. U. for Municipal\r\nSuffrage, and on February 8 one was given to the remonstrants. The\r\nHon. John M. Ropes, the Rev. Charles B. Rice, the Rev. Dr. Dexter of\r\nthe _Congregationalist_ and Arthur Lord spoke in the negative. They\r\nsaid they were employed as counsel by the remonstrants, whose names\r\nand numbers they declined to give. As Mr. Lord was unable to complete\r\nhis argument in the allotted time, at his request a further hearing\r\nwas granted on February 11. Extracts were read from letters by Mrs.\r\nClara T. Leonard and Mrs. A. D. T. Whitney.[317] Mrs. Howe, Lucy\r\nStone, Mr. Blackwell, Col. L. Edwin Dudley and Miss Tobey replied.\r\nChester W. Kingsley, chairman of the legislative committee, said that\r\nas no petitions against suffrage had been sent in he would ask all the\r\nremonstrants present to rise. Not a person rose, but the men standing\r\nin the aisles tried to sit down. Mr. Lord suggested that the\r\nremonstrants were averse to notoriety, whereupon Senator Kingsley\r\nasked all in favor to rise, and the great audience rose in a body.\r\n\r\nAmong the petitions sent in this year for Municipal Suffrage was one\r\nsigned by President Helen A. Shafer of Wellesley College, a number of\r\nthe professors and about seventy students who were over twenty-one.\r\nThe committee reported in favor of both Municipal and License\r\nSuffrage. The former was discussed March 12 and lost by a vote,\r\nincluding pairs, of 90 yeas, 139 nays. The _Woman's Journal_ said:\r\n\"Although not a majority, the weight of character, talent and\r\nexperience was overwhelmingly in favor of the bill, as is shown by the\r\nfact that _the chairmen of thirty of the House Committees_, out of a\r\ntotal of forty-one, were recorded in its favor.\"\r\n\r\nLicense Suffrage passed the Senate, 15 yeas, 12 nays, after a long\r\nfight, and was defeated in the House, 101 yeas, 42 nays.\r\n\r\n_1890_--Suffrage petitions were presented and also petitions asking\r\nthat fathers and mothers be made equal guardians of their children;\r\nthat contracts between husbands and wives be legally valid; and that a\r\nwidow be allowed to stay more than forty days in the house of her\r\ndeceased husband without paying rent. All these were refused.\r\n\r\nOn March 12 a hearing was given to the petitioners for suffrage. Mrs.\r\nStone, Mr. Blackwell, the Rev. J. W. Hamilton, Mrs. Ellen B. Dietrick,\r\nthe Rev. Frederick A. Hinckley, Mr. Crane of Woburn and Miss Alice\r\nStone Blackwell spoke in behalf of the W. S. A., and Mrs. Susan S.\r\nFessenden, Mrs. Amelia C. Thorpe and Miss Tobey in behalf of the W. C.\r\nT. U. Mr. Ropes, Dr. A. P. Peabody and J. B. Wiggin spoke against\r\nwoman suffrage. Mr. Lord asked that the hearing be extended for\r\nanother day, as he wished to speak in behalf of the remonstrants,\r\nalthough no petitions had been sent in. Mr. Blackwell requested the\r\nchairman of the committee to ask Mr. Lord to state definitely whom he\r\nrepresented. The chairman answered that if he did not choose to tell\r\nhe could not compel him. On March 19 a hearing was given to Mr. Lord,\r\nwho spoke for more than an hour. The usual distinguished suffrage\r\nadvocates spoke in answer.\r\n\r\nOn April 8 seventy-nine Republican Representatives met at the Parker\r\nHouse, Boston, in response to an invitation from the Republican\r\nmembers of the House Committee on Woman Suffrage. Ex-Gov. John D. Long\r\npresided. Addresses were made by Mr. Long, U. S. Collector Beard,\r\nMayor Thomas N. Hart of Boston, the Hon. Albert E. Pillsbury,\r\nex-president of the Senate, ex-Governor Claflin and State Treasurer\r\nGeorge E. Marden. Letters were read from the Hon. W. W. Crapo and\r\nex-Governor Ames. The following was unanimously adopted:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is the duty of the Republican party of\r\n     Massachusetts forthwith to extend Municipal Suffrage to the women\r\n     of the commonwealth.\r\n\r\nOn April 17, after extended discussion in the House, the bill was\r\nlost, including pairs, by 73 yeas, 141 nays. The same Legislature\r\ndefeated a proposal to disfranchise for a term of three years men\r\nconvicted of infamous crimes, and it voted to admit to suffrage men\r\nwho did not pay their poll-tax.\r\n\r\n_1891_--On February 4 a hearing was granted to the petitioners for\r\nMunicipal Suffrage, conducted by Mr. Blackwell for the association, by\r\nMrs. Fessenden for the W. C. T. U. To the usual speakers for the\r\nformer were added Mrs. Helen Campbell, the Rev. Charles G. Ames, and\r\nalso the Rev. Daniel Whitney, who had advocated woman suffrage in the\r\nMassachusetts constitutional convention of 1853 and now celebrated his\r\neighty-first birthday by supporting it again. The speakers for the W.\r\nC. T. U. were the Rev. Joseph Cook, Mrs. Thorpe, President Elmer\r\nHewitt Capen of Tufts College, Mrs. Katherine Lente Stevenson and\r\nothers. Mrs. Martha Moore Avery spoke for the labor reformers. No\r\nremonstrants appeared.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate, March 31, Senators Gilman, Nutter and Breed spoke for\r\nMunicipal Suffrage, and no one in the negative. The bill was lost by a\r\nvote, including pairs, of 12 yeas, 25 nays.\r\n\r\nThis year a bill was passed requiring the appointment of women as\r\nfactory inspectors, and two were appointed.\r\n\r\n_1892_--The suffrage association petitioned for Municipal and Full\r\nSuffrage, also for equal property rights for women. The W. C. T. U.\r\nfor Municipal and License Suffrage, and both societies for legislation\r\ngranting women equal facilities with men in registering to vote for\r\nschool committee. On March 2 a hearing was given by the Committee on\r\nElection Laws on an order introduced by Senator Gorham D. Gilman to\r\nremove the poll-tax prerequisite for women's school vote, as it had\r\nbeen removed from men. Bills to secure for them a more just and\r\nliberal method of registration, drafted by ex-Governor Long and Mr.\r\nBlackwell, were submitted. Addresses were made by these two, Senator\r\nGilman, Mrs. Cheney, Dr. Salome Merritt, Mrs. Brockway and others.\r\n\r\nOn February 19 a hearing was given on the suffrage petitions which\r\nwere advocated by Senator Gilman, Colonel Dudley, Mrs. Howe, Lucy\r\nStone, Mr. Blackwell, the Hon. George S. Hale, Mrs. Trask Hill and\r\nothers. No remonstrants appeared. On March 14 the hearing for the W.\r\nC. T. U. was held with many prominent advocates.\r\n\r\nLicense Suffrage was discussed in the House April 27, and on a _viva\r\nvoce_ vote was declared carried, but on a roll call was defeated, 93\r\nyeas, 96 nays. A reconsideration was moved next day and the advocates\r\nof the bill secured twenty-three additional votes, but the opponents\r\nalso increased their vote and the motion was refused. Out of the 240\r\nmembers 117 recorded themselves in favor of the bill. Municipal\r\nSuffrage was voted down in the Senate May 2, without debate, by 10\r\nyeas, 22 nays.\r\n\r\nThe poll-tax was abolished as a prerequisite for voting in the case of\r\nwomen. This had been done in the case of men in 1890. A bill to permit\r\na wife to bring an action against her husband, at law or in equity,\r\nfor any matter relating to her separate property or estate passed the\r\nHouse but was defeated in the Senate. The Senate Judiciary Committee\r\nreported against legislation to enable a woman to be appointed a\r\njustice of the peace.\r\n\r\n_1893_--This year for the first time the State W. S. A., the National\r\nW. S. A. of Massachusetts, the W. C. T. U., the Independent Women\r\nVoters and the Loyal Women of American Liberty all united in\r\npetitioning for a single measure, Municipal Suffrage. The hearing at\r\nthe State House on February 1 was conducted by Mr. Blackwell.\r\nAddresses were made by Lucy Stone,[318] Mrs. Howe, Mrs. Mary A.\r\nLivermore, Mrs. Stevenson, the Rev. Louis A. Banks, Mayor Elihu B.\r\nHayes of Lynn, Mrs. A. J. Gordon, Mrs. Trask Hill, Mrs. A. P.\r\nDickerman, Mrs. Fiske of St. Johns, N. B., Amos Beckford, George E.\r\nLothrop, Mrs. M. E. S. Cheney and Miss Blackwell. Mrs. M. E. Tucker\r\nFaunce was the sole remonstrant.\r\n\r\nThe committee reported in favor of the petitioners, 7 yeas, 4 nays.\r\nThe question was debated in the Legislature February 21. Every inch of\r\nspace was crowded, the first three rows of the men's gallery were\r\nallowed on this occasion to be occupied by women and even then many\r\nstood. On motion of Representative White of Brookline an amendment was\r\nadopted by 110 yeas, 90 nays, providing that Municipal Suffrage should\r\nbe granted conditionally; the question be submitted to a vote of the\r\nmen and women of the State, and the measure to go into effect only in\r\ncase the majority of those voting on it voted in favor. The bill as\r\namended was then defeated by 111 yeas, 101 nays, almost every opponent\r\nof suffrage voting against it. They thus virtually declared that they\r\nwere not willing women should have Municipal Suffrage even if the\r\nmajority of both men and women could be shown to favor it. The adverse\r\nmajority this year was ten votes; the smallest in any previous year\r\nhad been 49.\r\n\r\n_1894_--Gov. Frederick T. Greenhalge, in his inaugural message to the\r\nLegislature, strongly urged that it should consider the extension of\r\nMunicipal Suffrage to women.\r\n\r\nOn January 18 a hearing was given by the Joint Special Committee. No\r\nremonstrant petitions had been sent in. The chairman invited alternate\r\nspeeches from suffragists and opponents, but only one of the latter\r\npresented himself, J. Otis Wardwell of Haverhill, who said:\r\n\r\n     I appear here this morning for a lady who, I understand, has\r\n     occupied a position as chairman or secretary of an organization\r\n     that has for some time been an active opponent of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n     _Mr. Blackwell_--May I inquire what the organization is that the\r\n     gentleman refers to? We have never been able to find out much\r\n     about this organization against woman suffrage. We hear that\r\n     there is one, but if so it is a secret society. What is the name\r\n     of it?\r\n\r\n     MR. WARDWELL--I do not know the name of it, sir. [Laughter.]\r\n\r\nWhen pressed for the name of the lady at whose request he appeared he\r\nfinally acknowledged that it was Mrs. C. D. Homans of Boston. It was\r\nafterwards reported that she was extremely indignant with him for\r\nhaving disclosed her name.\r\n\r\nAddresses in favor of suffrage were made by Mrs. Howe, Mrs. Livermore,\r\nMr. Ernst, Mr. Garrison, Mr. and Miss Blackwell, for the State W. S.\r\nA.; by Mrs. Cheney, president, for the State School Suffrage\r\nAssociation; by Dr. Salome Merritt and Miss Charlotte Lobdell for the\r\nNational W. S. A. of Massachusetts; by Willard Howland, Mrs. Gleason\r\nand others for the W. C. T. U.; by Mrs. Trask Hill for the Independent\r\nWomen Voters; and by Mrs. Avery for the labor element; also by Miss\r\nCatherine Spence of Australia, Mrs. Emily A. Fifield of the Boston\r\nschool board, and others. Henry H. Faxon added a few words.\r\n\r\nA second hearing was given January 19, at which Mrs. Fessenden and\r\ntwelve other speakers represented the W. C. T. U. No remonstrants\r\nappeared. At the request of a member of the Joint Special Committee a\r\nthird hearing was given on January 29. The Rev. Dr. Hamilton, Mrs. L.\r\nA. Morrison, Mrs. Trask Hill and others spoke in favor of suffrage,\r\nand Jeremiah J. Donovan against it. The committee made a majority\r\nreport against Municipal Suffrage and a minority report in favor.\r\n\r\nOn January 31 Arthur S. Kneil offered an amendment providing that the\r\nquestion should be submitted to the men and women of the State, and\r\nthat the act should take effect only if a majority of the votes cast\r\non the proposition were in favor. Wm. H. Burges wanted it submitted to\r\nthe men only. A second amendment proposed to lay the whole matter on\r\nthe table till the opinion of the Supreme Court could be taken on the\r\nconstitutionality of Mr. Kneil's amendment. On February 1 there was a\r\nspirited discussion but finally both amendments were defeated, and\r\nthe minority report in favor of the bill was substituted for the\r\nadverse majority report by a vote of 104 yeas, 90 nays.\r\n\r\nOn February 2 Senator Arthur H. Wellman urged the adoption of his\r\norder that the Justices of the Supreme Court should be required to\r\ngive their opinion to the House on three questions:\r\n\r\n     1. Is it constitutional, in an act granting to women the right to\r\n     vote in town and city elections, to provide that such act shall\r\n     take effect throughout the commonwealth upon its acceptance by a\r\n     majority of the voters of the commonwealth?\r\n\r\n     2. Is it constitutional to provide in such an act that it shall\r\n     take effect in a city or town upon its acceptance by a majority\r\n     of the voters of such city or town?\r\n\r\n     3. Is it constitutional to provide that such an act shall take\r\n     effect throughout the commonwealth upon its acceptance by a\r\n     majority of the voters of the commonwealth, including women\r\n     specially authorized to register and vote upon this question?\r\n\r\nAlfred S. Roe and the other leading advocates of Municipal Suffrage\r\nwithdrew their opposition to the order, saying that they preferred the\r\nbill as it stood, but that if amendments were to be added to it at any\r\nsubsequent stage it would be well to know whether they were\r\nconstitutional. The order was adopted.\r\n\r\nOn March 3 four Justices of the Supreme Court--Field, Allen, Morton\r\nand Lathrop--answered \"No\" to all three questions. Justices Holmes and\r\nBarker answered \"Yes\" to all three; and Justice Knowlton answered \"No\"\r\nto the first and third and \"Yes\" to the second. These opinions were\r\npublished in full in the _Woman's Journal_ of March 10, 1894.\r\n\r\nOn March 14 Municipal Suffrage was discussed in open session. An\r\namendment was offered to limit the right to taxpaying women and a\r\nsubstitute bill to allow women to vote at one election only. The\r\nlatter was offered by Richard J. Hayes of Boston, who said, \"You would\r\nsee the lowest women literally driven to the polls by thousands by\r\nmercenary politicians. The object lesson would settle the question\r\nforever.\" The amendment and the substitute were lost and the bill was\r\npassed to its third reading by a vote, including pairs, of 122 yeas,\r\n106 nays.\r\n\r\nOn March 29 the galleries were crowded with women. Richard Sullivan of\r\nBoston offered an additional section that the question be submitted to\r\nthe men at the November election for an expression of opinion. This\r\nwas adopted by 109 yeas, 93 nays. The bill to grant women Municipal\r\nSuffrage at once, irrespective of what the expression of opinion in\r\nNovember might be, was then passed to be engrossed, by a vote,\r\nincluding pairs, of 118 yeas, 107 nays. A motion to reconsider was\r\nvoted down.\r\n\r\nOn April 5 the bill came up in the Senate. Floor and galleries were\r\ncrowded and hundreds were turned away. Senator William B. Lawrence of\r\nMedford, a distiller, offered as a substitute for the bill a proposal\r\nto submit the question to the men at the November election for an\r\nexpression of opinion as a guide to action by the next Legislature. He\r\nsaid it was absurd to grant women the suffrage first and call for an\r\nexpression of opinion by the men afterward. The vote on the substitute\r\nwas a tie, 19 yeas, 19 nays. To relieve the president of the Senate\r\nfrom the necessity of voting Senator John F. Fitzgerald changed his\r\nvote, but Senator Butler declined to be so relieved and gave his\r\ncasting vote against the substitute. The bill for Municipal Suffrage\r\nwas then defeated by 14 yeas, 24 nays.\r\n\r\nThe Boston _Herald_, of April 9, had an editorial entitled Liquor and\r\nWoman Suffrage, expressing satisfaction in the defeat of the bill but\r\nemphatic disapproval of the corrupt methods used against it in the\r\nSenate. A majority of the Senators had promised to vote for it but the\r\nLiquor Dealer's Association raised a large sum of money to accomplish\r\nits defeat, a persistent lobby worked against it and several Senators\r\nchanged front. The _Herald_ plainly intimated that the result was due\r\nto bribery.\r\n\r\nThe credit of the unusually good vote in the House in 1893 and '94 was\r\nlargely due to Representative Alfred S. Roe of Worcester, an able\r\nmember, highly esteemed and very popular, who worked for the bill with\r\nthe utmost zeal and perseverance.\r\n\r\nThere were petitions this year from many different organizations\r\nrepresenting a vast aggregate membership. On June 9 a bill to allow\r\nwomen to be notaries public was defeated in the Senate by 10 yeas, 12\r\nnays.\r\n\r\n_1895._--On January 30 a great hearing was held in old\r\nRepresentatives' Hall at the State House, with floor, aisles and\r\ngalleries crowded to the utmost capacity. Senator Alpheus M. Eldridge\r\npresided and Mrs. Livermore, as president of the State Association,\r\nconducted the hearing for the five organizations that appeared as\r\npetitioners. Addresses were made by Lady Henry Somerset, Mrs. Howe,\r\nMr. Blackwell, Profs. Hayes and Webster of Wellesley College, Mrs.\r\nFessenden, Mrs. Trask Hill, Mrs. Emily McLaughlin, Mrs. Boland, John\r\nDean, F. C. Nash, Frank H. Foster, chairman of the legislative\r\ncommittee of the American Federation of Labor for Massachusetts, James\r\nF. Norton, the representative of 10,000 Good Templars.\r\n\r\nNo opposing petitions had been sent in but Thomas Russell appeared as\r\nattorney for the remonstrants and said: \"Believing as they do that the\r\nproper place for women is not in public urging or remonstrating\r\nagainst legislation before public gatherings, but rather in the home,\r\nthe hospital, the school, the public institution where sin and\r\nsuffering are to be found and to be alleviated, they have not\r\nthemselves appeared before you\"--but had sent him.[319] Representative\r\nRoe said that the lawyer who had spoken for the remonstrants at the\r\nhearing of 1894 had received $500 for his services, and asked Mr.\r\nRussell if he appeared in the same capacity. He answered that no\r\ncompensation had been promised him, and that he did not mean to accept\r\nany. He added: \"I represent no organization, anything more than an\r\ninformal gathering of ladies, and as for the numbers I can not state.\r\nBut I do not come here basing my claim to be heard on the numbers of\r\nthose who have asked me to appear. It is the justice of the cause\r\nwhich I speak upon that entitles me to a hearing, as it would if there\r\nwere no one but myself.\"\r\n\r\nLater twelve remonstrances were sent in, signed by 748 women. For\r\nsuffrage there were 210 petitions from 186 towns and cities\r\nrepresenting 133,111 individuals, men and women.\r\n\r\nThe opposition, alarmed by the large affirmative vote of 1894, this\r\nyear put forth unprecedented efforts. Daily papers were paid for\r\npublishing voluminous letters against suffrage--sometimes of four\r\ncolumns--and an active and unscrupulous lobby worked against the bill.\r\nFor the first time in history an anti-suffrage association was formed\r\nwithin the Legislature itself. Representatives Dallinger, Humphrey,\r\nBancroft of Clinton, Eddy of New Bedford, and others, organized\r\nthemselves into a society, elected a chairman and secretary and\r\nworked strenuously and systematically, making a thorough canvass of\r\nthe House and pledging as many members as possible to vote \"No.\"\r\n\r\nThe suffragists made the mistake of devoting their attention mainly to\r\nthe Senate, where it was expected that the bill would come up first,\r\nand where it was believed that the main difficulty would be, but on\r\nMarch 5 the Municipal Suffrage Bill was brought up in the House. Every\r\ninch of space was crowded with spectators. After much discussion the\r\nbill was defeated by 137 yeas, 97 nays.\r\n\r\nOn March 13 a bill to raise the \"age of protection\" for girls from 16\r\nto 18 years was defeated by 108 yeas, 55 nays.\r\n\r\nOn May 17 Senator Wellman's bill for a \"mock referendum\" was adopted\r\nby the Legislature. It proposed to take a vote of the men and women of\r\nthe State on the question \"Is it expedient that Municipal Suffrage\r\nshould be extended to women?\"\r\n\r\nTHE MOCK REFERENDUM: This is called by the advocates of equal rights a\r\n\"mock referendum\" because it was to have no legal validity and was to\r\ngive the women nothing even if it should be carried in their favor.\r\nThe _Woman's Journal_ said:\r\n\r\n     Two years ago an amendment was added to the Municipal Suffrage\r\n     Bill providing that it should become law when ratified by a vote\r\n     of the majority of the men and women of the State. Nearly every\r\n     opponent in the House voted against the bill after that amendment\r\n     had been incorporated, showing clearly that they were not willing\r\n     to let women have suffrage even if a majority of the men and\r\n     women of the State should vote for it. It was then believed that\r\n     such action would be constitutional. The Supreme Court afterwards\r\n     gave its opinion that Municipal Suffrage could not be extended by\r\n     a popular vote of either the men or the women, or both, but must\r\n     be extended, if at all, by the Legislature. Following that\r\n     decision, the opponents have become clamorous for a popular vote.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists, who, beginning in 1869, had petitioned year after\r\nyear for the submission to the voters of a legal and straightforward\r\nconstitutional amendment, which would give women the ballot if the\r\nmajority voted for it, were disgusted with this sham substitution.\r\nMrs. Livermore, the State president, declared that she would neither\r\ntake part in the mock vote herself nor advise others to do so. This\r\nfeeling was so general that at the last meeting of the executive\r\ncommittee of the W. S. A. for the season, in June, it was found\r\nimpossible even to pass a resolution recommending those men and women\r\nwho favored equal suffrage to go to the polls and say so.\r\n\r\nA number of individual suffragists, however, believed that advantage\r\nshould be taken of the chance to make an educational campaign and, as\r\nthe _Woman's Journal_ of June 8 said, \"to use the opportunity for what\r\nit is worth as a means of agitation.\" Therefore a Suffrage Referendum\r\nState Committee was formed of more than fifty prominent men and women,\r\nincluding U. S. Senator Hoar, ex-Governor Long, the Hon. J. Q. A.\r\nBrackett, Mrs. Howe, Mrs. Livermore, Mrs. Fannie B. Ames, Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Stuart Phelps Ward, the editors of the _Woman's Journal_ and\r\nothers. Mrs. Mary Clarke Smith was employed as organizer, beginning\r\nJuly 10, and as good a campaign was made as the circumstances\r\npermitted. By the time the executive committee reassembled in October,\r\nevery one had become convinced of the wisdom of this course, and the\r\nState Suffrage Association and the Referendum Committee worked hand in\r\nhand during the last few weeks before election. It was a disadvantage\r\nthat the bill for the \"mock referendum\" was passed just before people\r\nwent away for the summer, and that the vote was to be taken soon after\r\nthey came back in the fall; nevertheless, a spirited campaign was\r\nmade, a large number of meetings and rallies were held and a great\r\nquantity of literature was distributed.\r\n\r\nAbout six weeks before election a Man Suffrage Association was formed\r\nwith Francis C. Lowell as chairman, Thomas Russell as treasurer and\r\nCharles R. Saunders as salaried secretary.[320] This society was\r\ncomposed wholly of men. It sent out an enormous number of circulars\r\nand other documents, spent money like water, enlisted active political\r\nworkers, utilized to a considerable extent the party \"machines,\" and\r\nas far as possible secured a committee of men to work at each polling\r\nplace on election day and roll up a large negative vote of men. It\r\ncontained a number of influential politicians who displayed much skill\r\nin their tactics. They published a manifesto against equal rights\r\nsigned by one hundred prominent men. The _Woman's Journal_, which\r\nprinted this document on October 19, said:\r\n\r\n     In the main the protest represents merely money and social\r\n     position. There are half-a-dozen names on it which it is a pity\r\n     and a shame to see there. All the rest were to be expected. They\r\n     are men whose opinion would be of weight on questions of stocks\r\n     and bonds, but whose opinion on questions of moral reform has\r\n     only a minus value.... Its signers have pilloried themselves for\r\n     posterity. It is regarded as discourteous to-day to remind\r\n     President Eliot of Harvard that his father was the only member of\r\n     Congress from Massachusetts who voted for the Fugitive Slave Law.\r\n     Forty years hence it will be regarded as cruel to remind the\r\n     children of these gentlemen [among whom was President Eliot] that\r\n     their fathers put their names to a protest against equal rights\r\n     for women.\r\n\r\nAt first the two anti-suffrage associations, the men's and the\r\nwomen's, co-operated with the suffragists in getting up debates; but\r\nno man ever consented to take part in one against suffrage a second\r\ntime, and toward the end of the campaign it became almost impossible\r\nto secure speakers in the negative. Both sides published appeals and\r\ncounter-appeals and the question was discussed in the press, at public\r\nmeetings and in social circles to an extent unprecedented in the\r\nhistory of the State. Even the advertisements in the street cars began\r\nwith the query in large letters, Should Women Vote? in order to\r\nattract attention to a particular brand of soap, etc.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the canvass the opponents of suffrage\r\ncirculated pledges for signature by women promising to vote \"No\" in\r\nNovember,[321] but they soon became convinced that in trying to get\r\nout a large vote of women against suffrage they had undertaken more\r\nthan they could accomplish. The Massachusetts Association Opposed to\r\nthe Further Extension of Suffrage to Women supplied in plate form to a\r\nlarge number of State papers a series of articles one of which urged\r\nwomen to express themselves against suffrage, warned them that\r\n\"_silence will be cited as consent_,\" and said: \"It is our duty in any\r\nclear and forcible way that presents itself, to say 'I am not sure\r\nthat our country should run this enormous new risk.'\"\r\n\r\nThe \"antis\" have since asserted that in saying \"in any clear and\r\nforcible way that presents itself,\" they did not mean to include the\r\nmost obvious way, _i. e._, by voting \"No\" when given an opportunity by\r\nthe Legislature to do so. Later in the campaign they issued a\r\nmanifesto declaring that they did not urge women to register or vote,\r\nand that _silence was not to be interpreted as consent_. And finally,\r\njust before registration closed in Boston and the other cities, when\r\nit was clear that the majority of women were not going to register to\r\nvote either way, they issued another manifesto urging women _not_ to\r\nvote against suffrage!\r\n\r\nThis was a transparent device to conceal the fewness of their numbers,\r\nand they thus stultified all their previous professions, as they had\r\nasserted for years that whenever women were given the right to vote on\r\nan important question it would be their duty to do so, irrespective of\r\ntheir personal inclinations, and it was in order to save women from\r\nthis burden that their enfranchisement was opposed. If they could have\r\nbrought out an overwhelming vote of women against equal suffrage, of\r\ncourse they would have done so. Since they could not, it was their\r\npolicy to advise women not to express themselves and thus let the few\r\nwho were strongly opposed be confounded with the mass of those who\r\nwere indifferent. The Man Suffrage Association, which professed to be\r\nworking in full harmony with the women's organization, declared in\r\nsmall and inconspicuous type that it did not urge women to take the\r\ntrouble to register, merely for the sake of expressing themselves on\r\nthe referendum, but that it did urge those who voted at all to vote\r\n\"No.\" It published a circular giving reasons \"why women and the\r\nfriends of women should vote no,\" and it covered walls and fences from\r\none end of the State to the other with huge placards bearing in\r\nenormous letters the words, \"Men and Women, Vote No!\"\r\n\r\nThe main object of this association, however, was not to get an\r\nexpression of opinion from the women (which would weigh little either\r\nway) but to influence the Legislature through a large negative vote\r\nfrom the men. Mr. Saunders was reported in an interview in the Boston\r\n_Herald_ as saying that the women who took the trouble to vote at all\r\nwould probably vote in favor ten to one (it proved to be twenty-five\r\nto one), but that if the _men_ would give a good majority against it\r\nthe Legislature could be relied upon to defeat a genuine amendment for\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nThe suffragists spent only $1,300 during the entire canvass. The Man\r\nSuffrage Association never made the sworn report of its receipts and\r\nexpenditures which the law requires of every campaign committee,\r\nalthough even the papers opposed to suffrage exhorted it to do so and\r\nwarned it that it was placing itself in a false position by refusing,\r\nbut the treasurer published an unsworn statement, not of his receipts\r\nbut of his general expenditures, by which it appeared that the\r\nassociation, during the six weeks of its existence, spent $3,576. In\r\naddition large sums were expended by the women's anti-suffrage\r\nassociation, which, not being a campaign committee but a permanent\r\nsociety, was under no legal obligation to file a statement.\r\n\r\nThe \"mock referendum\" was voted on at the State election, Nov. 5,\r\n1895, receiving 108,974 yeas, 187,837 nays. Men cast 86,970 yeas,\r\n186,115 nays; women cast 22,204 yeas, 861 nays. Forty-eight towns gave\r\na majority for equal suffrage, two were a tie, and in several the\r\nadverse majority was only one or two votes, and yet in most of these\r\ntowns no suffrage league existed, and in some of them no suffrage\r\nmeeting ever had been held.\r\n\r\nThe number of men who voted in the affirmative was a general surprise.\r\nA leaflet by one of the leading remonstrants, circulated during the\r\ncampaign, asserted that \"not one citizen of sound judgment in a\r\nhundred is in favor of woman suffrage;\" but nearly one-third of the\r\nmale voters who expressed themselves declared for it. There was the\r\nsmallest affirmative vote in the most disreputable wards of Boston.\r\nNearly 2,000 more votes of men were cast for suffrage than had been\r\ncast for prohibition in 1889. The proportion of votes in favor was\r\nalmost twice as large as in Rhode Island, the only other New England\r\nState in which the question had been submitted, although in that there\r\nwas no anti-suffrage association in the field. Outside of Boston the\r\nlargest negative vote by women was cast in Cambridge and Newton, which\r\nhave the reputation of being remonstrant strongholds. In 238 of the\r\n322 towns not one woman voted \"No.\" In most of these the anti-suffrage\r\nassociation had no branches, and there is no reason to suppose that\r\nthe women ever had heard of its eleventh-hour advice to women not to\r\nvote. In every county, and in every Congressional, Senatorial and\r\nRepresentative district the women's vote was in favor at least ten to\r\none. The \"mock referendum\" answered the main purpose of its promoters,\r\nhowever, for it did seriously cut down the vote for suffrage in the\r\nLegislature for several years thereafter, but it made a host of\r\nconverts among the people at large and gave a fresh impetus to the\r\nactivity of the State Suffrage Association, which ever since has\r\nsteadily grown in membership.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n_1896_--The usual petitions for suffrage were presented from 79 cities\r\nand towns, with 7,780 signatures. The Joint Special Committee on Woman\r\nSuffrage, which had been appointed annually for many years, was\r\ndiscontinued, with the good result that the suffragists ever since\r\nhave had their hearings before two more influential committees, those\r\non Constitutional Amendments and on Election Laws. On February 26 the\r\nlatter gave a hearing for Municipal Suffrage. Mr. Blackwell opened the\r\ncase for the petitioners and the usual number of fine addresses were\r\nmade. Thomas Russell spoke for the remonstrants, and Miss Blackwell\r\nreplied to him. On February 27 the Committee on Constitutional\r\nAmendments gave a hearing. Addresses were made by Mrs. Howe, Mr.\r\nGarrison, the Rev. Florence E. Kollock, Oswald Garrison Villard, Mr.\r\nErnst, Mrs. Isabel C. Barrows, Miss Cora A. Benneson and Clyde\r\nDuniway, formerly of Oregon. Mr. Russell again spoke for the\r\nremonstrants and was answered by Miss Blackwell, Miss Gail Laughlin\r\nand Mrs. Mary Clarke Smith.\r\n\r\nOn March 4 a hearing was given to the petitioners for License\r\nSuffrage. Just after the hearing closed Mr. Russell arrived to\r\nremonstrate, but too late.\r\n\r\nOn March 9 a hearing was given on the petition of the State W. S. A.\r\nthat the times of registration should be the same for women (school)\r\nvoters as for men.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Constitutional Amendments recommended that the\r\nquestion of submitting a suffrage amendment be referred to the next\r\nLegislature--three dissenting and favoring its submission this year.\r\nOn March 23 consideration of the question was voted down and the yeas\r\nand nays were refused.\r\n\r\nOn March 31 and April 1 License Suffrage was discussed and finally\r\ndefeated by 93 yeas, 116 nays, including pairs.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Election Laws reported in favor of Municipal Suffrage\r\nbut the bill was defeated.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Court decided that women could not be made notaries public\r\nbecause they are not distinctly named as eligible in the State\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nThomas F. Keenan, an opponent of woman suffrage, introduced a bill to\r\nlicense houses \"for commercial sexual intercourse,\" which he alone\r\nvoted for.[322]\r\n\r\n_1897_--It was decided to ask this year for a thorough revision and\r\nequalization of the statutes bearing on domestic relations, in view of\r\nthe fact that the last Legislature had appointed a committee of\r\nlawyers to revise and codify the laws. Especial attention was called\r\nto the need of a law making fathers and mothers joint guardians of\r\ntheir children. Mr. Ernst, in behalf of the association, prepared a\r\nbill equalizing the property rights of husbands and wives. Mr.\r\nRussell, in behalf of the M. A. O. F. E. S. W. (which had for years\r\nbeen circulating leaflets declaring that the laws of Massachusetts\r\nwere already more than just to women) prepared a bill tending in a\r\nsimilar direction; and a Judge of Probate prepared a more limited\r\nbill. All three appeared before the revising committee and, after\r\nrepeated conferences, a bill making some improvements was recommended\r\nby the committee and enacted by the Legislature, but with a proviso\r\nthat it should not go into effect until the following year, in order\r\nthat the next Legislature might have a chance to amend it.\r\n\r\nOn February 10 the committee gave a hearing to the petitioners for the\r\nsubmission of an amendment to enfranchise women. It was addressed by\r\nMr. Blackwell, Mrs. Cheney, Mrs. Boland, the Rev. Thomas Scully, the\r\nRev. Mr. Ames, the Rev. Augusta Chapin, Miss Blackwell and others. No\r\nremonstrants appeared. The committee reported favorably, but on\r\nFebruary 18 the bill was defeated by 74 yeas, 107 nays.\r\n\r\nOn February 24 the Committee on Election Laws heard arguments for\r\nMunicipal and Presidential Suffrage, and also on the petition of the\r\nW. C. T. U. for License Suffrage. The committee had before it 144\r\nlargely signed petitions for suffrage and none against it. Mrs. Howe\r\nand Mr. Blackwell spoke in behalf of the measures asked for by the\r\nsuffrage association, and a large number of prominent women for the W.\r\nC. T. U. Mr. Russell, Mrs. J. Elliott Cabot, Frank Foxcroft, Miss\r\nDewey, Dr. Walter Channing, Mrs. A. J. George, A. Lawrence Lowell and\r\nMiss Mary A. J. McIntyre spoke against all three bills. Miss\r\nBlackwell, at the close, replied in behalf of both associations.\r\nMembers of the committee asked the president of the anti-suffrage\r\nassociation, Mrs. Cabot, and almost all the women who spoke on that\r\nside whether they would vote for or against license if they had the\r\nballot. Everyone answered that she would vote for license. Mr. Russell\r\nhad declared that if women were allowed to vote, \"no license would be\r\ncarried in every town and city of the commonwealth, contrary to the\r\nwill of the people.\" The committee gave a majority report against all\r\nthe bills.\r\n\r\nOn March 10 the question of accepting the adverse report on License\r\nSuffrage came up in the Legislature. The vote stood, 100 yeas, 100\r\nnays, and Speaker John L. Bates gave his casting vote in favor of\r\nsubstituting the bill for the adverse report. On March 18 the question\r\nwas debated and the vote resulted in 108 yeas, 125 nays. There was\r\nmuch public interest and a lively discussion in the papers. Municipal\r\nand Presidential Suffrage were lost without a roll-call. A bill to\r\nmake the Boston School Board appointive instead of elective, which\r\nwould have deprived women of their School Suffrage, was defeated.\r\n\r\n_1898_--The hearing on February 2 was conducted by Mr. Blackwell for\r\nthe petitioners; Mr. Russell for the remonstrants. A letter from\r\nex-Gov. William Claflin in favor of suffrage was read. Mrs. Anna\r\nChristy Fall, Mr. Garrison, ex-U. S. Attorney Frank B. Allen, Mrs.\r\nHelen Adelaide Shaw, Dr. A. E. Winship, editor of the _Journal of\r\nEducation_, and others spoke for suffrage; Mrs. Arthur D. Gilman, Mrs.\r\nEgbert C. Smythe, Mrs. Rothery of Wellesley, Mrs. Lincoln R. Stone\r\nand Mrs. George against it. Miss Blackwell replied for the\r\npetitioners. The committee reported \"leave to withdraw.\" On February\r\n14, after debate in the House of Representatives, the vote stood 44\r\nyeas, 97 nays.\r\n\r\nOn February 23 the committee gave a hearing on Municipal Suffrage and\r\non License Suffrage, both of which were eloquently urged. Mrs. Cabot,\r\nMrs. Charles E. Guild, the Rev. Thomas Van Ness, the Rev. Reuen\r\nThomas, Mrs. Henry F. Durant, Mrs. William T. Sedgwick, Mr. Foxcroft\r\nand Mr. Russell spoke in opposition. Municipal Suffrage was not\r\ndebated, but after discussion on March 10 and 11, in the House of\r\nRepresentatives, the vote on License Suffrage, including pairs, stood\r\n60 yeas, 116 nays.\r\n\r\nThe record for 1899 and 1900 presented no variations except that a\r\nnumber of local associations petitioned for Municipal Suffrage for\r\nTaxpaying Women. The State association did not officially ask for\r\nthis, though the majority of its officers favored the measure. The\r\nannual hearings were given, the usual large crowds were in attendance,\r\nthe ablest men and women in the State advocated the granting of\r\nsuffrage, those heretofore mentioned spoke in opposition,[323] and the\r\nnegative vote was in about the same proportion as before the\r\n\"remonstrants\" made their appearance.[324]\r\n\r\nLAWS: Until 1845 the women of Massachusetts suffered to the fullest\r\nextent the barbarities of the English Common Law. After that date the\r\nchanges were gradual but very slow. From 1884 there was but little\r\nimprovement in the property laws until 1899, when a radical revision\r\nwas effected by a legislative committee and approved by the\r\nLegislature. As there was to be a general revision of the statutes and\r\nthe new book would not be issued until Jan. 1, 1902, it was decided\r\nthat all should go into effect at that date. The new property law for\r\nwomen provides as follows: No distinction is made between real and\r\npersonal property in distributing the estate. The surviving husband or\r\nwife takes and holds one-third if the deceased leaves children or\r\ntheir descendants; $5,000 and one-half of the remaining estate if the\r\ndeceased leaves no issue; and the whole if the deceased leaves no\r\nkindred. This is taken absolutely and not for life. Curtesy and dower\r\nhave not been abolished but the old-time curtesy, which is a life\r\ninterest in the whole of a deceased wife's real estate, is cut down to\r\na life interest in one-third, the same as dower; and in order to be\r\nentitled to dower or curtesy the surviving husband or wife must elect\r\nto take it in preference to abiding by the above provisions.\r\n\r\nEither husband or wife can make a will under the new law without the\r\nconsent of the other, but the survivor, if not satisfied with the will\r\nof the deceased, can waive it within a year and take the same share of\r\nthe estate that he (or she) would have taken if there had been no\r\nwill, except that, if he would thus become entitled to more than\r\n$10,000 in value, he shall receive, in addition to that amount, only\r\nthe income during his life of the excess of his share of such estate\r\nabove that amount; and except that, if the deceased leaves no kindred,\r\nhe, upon such waiver, shall take the interest he would have taken if\r\nthe deceased had died leaving kindred but no issue.\r\n\r\nA discretionary amount may be assigned by the Probate Court to the\r\nwidow for the support of herself and minor children and takes\r\nprecedence of the debts of the deceased. The old law took this\r\nallowance out of the personal estate only, and often the widow was\r\nnot able to receive the immediate assistance she needed, because the\r\nproperty was all in the form of real estate. The new law permits the\r\nreal estate to be used if necessary. It also gives $100 to a minor\r\nchild for his immediate necessities, if there is no widow; the old law\r\ngave $50. The new law permits the widow to remain in her husband's\r\nhouse for six months after his death. The old law gave her only forty\r\ndays.\r\n\r\nA married woman has full control of her separate property, and can\r\ndispose of her real estate subject only to the husband's interests. If\r\nshe has been deserted or if the court has decreed that she is living\r\napart from him for justifiable cause, she can by will or deed dispose\r\nof all her real and personal estate as if unmarried. The husband can\r\ndo the same.\r\n\r\nA married woman can be executor, administrator, guardian or trustee.\r\nShe may make contracts with any one except her husband; may sue and be\r\nsued, carry on business in her own name, by complying with the legal\r\nrequirements; control and invest her earnings and enter into\r\npartnerships. She is responsible for her contracts and debts and her\r\nproperty may be held for them. The husband is not liable on any\r\njudgments recovered against the wife alone, and her separate property\r\nis not liable on any judgment or execution against the husband. Suits\r\nbetween husband and wife are not allowed except for divorce.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the persons and estates of minor\r\nchildren; he has power to dispose of them during the lifetime of the\r\nmother and may appoint a guardian at his death.[325]\r\n\r\nFor non-support of wife and minor children the husband may be fined\r\nnot exceeding $20 or imprisoned in the house of correction not\r\nexceeding six months. At the discretion of the court the fine is paid\r\nin whole or part to the town, city, society or person actually\r\nsupporting such wife and children. (1893.)\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 13 years in\r\n1886; to 14 in 1888; to 16 in 1893. The penalty is imprisonment in the\r\nState prison for life or for any term of years, or for any term in any\r\nother penal institution in the commonwealth. This may be one day in\r\nthe city jail.\r\n\r\nAmong various laws passed in the interests of women was one in 1895\r\nmaking army nurses eligible to receive State aid. One of 1896 requires\r\nthe State to inter the wife or widow of an honorably discharged\r\nsoldier, sailor or marine who served during the Civil War, if she did\r\nnot leave sufficient means for funeral expenses, provided she was\r\nmarried prior to 1870. In 1900 it was enacted that the State should\r\nperform a similar service for the mothers of said soldiers, sailors or\r\nmarines, and that this should not be with the pauper dead, in either\r\ncase.\r\n\r\nMassachusetts has detailed laws regarding the employment of women,\r\namong them one restricting the hours of work in any mercantile\r\nestablishment to fifty-eight in a week, except in retail stores during\r\nthe month of December. Ten hours is a legal workday for women in\r\ngeneral.\r\n\r\nSeparate houses of detention are required for women prisoners in\r\ncities of over 30,000.[326]\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: The original charter of Massachusetts in 1691 did not\r\nexclude women from voting. In 1780 the first constitution prohibited\r\nthem from voting except for certain officers. The new constitution of\r\n1820 limited the suffrage strictly to males.\r\n\r\nIn 1879 the Legislature enacted that a woman twenty-one years of age,\r\nwho could give satisfactory evidence as to residence and who could\r\nstand the educational test (_i. e._, be able to read five lines of the\r\nconstitution and write her name), and who should give notice in\r\nwriting to the assessors that she wished to be assessed a poll tax\r\n(two dollars) and should give in under oath a statement of her taxable\r\nproperty (which was not required of men, as they had the option of\r\nletting the assessors guess at the amount) should thereupon be\r\nassessed and should be entitled to register and vote for members of\r\nschool boards.[327] In order to keep her name on the registration\r\nlist this entire process had to be repeated every year, while a man's\r\nname once placed on the list was kept there without further effort on\r\nhis part, and the payment of the same poll tax entitled him to full\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 the poll tax was reduced to fifty cents, and the law was\r\nchanged so that women's names should remain on the registration list\r\nso long as they continued to reside and pay their taxes in the place\r\nwhere they were registered. Even now, however, it requires constant\r\nwatchfulness on their part to have this done. In 1890 the poll tax as\r\na prerequisite for voting was abolished for men, and in 1892 for\r\nwomen. Only a few weeks in each year were set apart when women might\r\nregister until 1898, when it was enacted that the time of registration\r\nshould be the same for both.\r\n\r\nThe School Suffrage includes only a vote for members of the school\r\nboard and not for supervisors, appropriations or any questions\r\nconnected with the public schools. Women are not authorized to attend\r\ncaucuses or have any voice in nominations of school officers. As they\r\nwere thus deprived of all voice in selecting candidates, an\r\nassociation, Independent Women Voters, was formed in Boston in 1889 by\r\nMrs. Eliza Trask Hill, who served as president until 1896, when she\r\nremoved from the city, and Mrs. Sarah J. Boyden has filled the office\r\nsince then. This organization, which was entered at the registration\r\noffice as a political party, holds a caucus in each ward between\r\nJanuary 1 and April 1 every year and nominates candidates for the\r\nSchool Board. Such nomination by 100 or more legal voters entitles\r\ntheir names to be placed on the Australian ballot. Some of the\r\nnominees of the Independent Women Voters are often accepted by the\r\nregular parties, but even when this is refused they are sometimes\r\nelected over the Republican or Democratic candidates.\r\n\r\nBecause of the conditions attached and the small privilege granted it\r\nis remarkable that any considerable number of women should have voted\r\nduring these past years. When School Suffrage was first granted, in\r\n1879, only 934 women voted, and for the first seven years the average\r\nwas only 940. Since then there has been a large increase of interest.\r\nDuring the past seven years the number never has fallen below 5,000.\r\nIn 1898, 5,201 women voted; in 1899, 7,090; in 1900, 9,542; and this\r\nyear (1901) there were 15,545 names on the register and 11,620 voted.\r\nThe highest number was reached in 1888, when under special\r\ncircumstances 25,279 women were registered and 19,490 voted.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women have served as School Committee (trustees) since\r\n1874. For some time previous to 1884 they could hold by appointment\r\nthe offices of overseers of the poor, trustees of public libraries,\r\nschool supervisors, members of the State Boards of Education and of\r\nHealth, Lunacy and Charity, without special legislation. It was\r\nrequired that there should be women on the boards of the three State\r\nPrimary and Reform Schools, State workhouse, State almshouse and Board\r\nof Prison Commissioners, and that certain managers and officers of the\r\nReformatory Prison for Women at Sherborn should be women.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 a bill was passed requiring the appointment of two women on\r\nthe board of every Hospital for the Insane and one woman physician for\r\neach. In 1885 it was enacted that women might be assistant registers\r\nof deeds; in 1886 that they might be elected overseers of the poor. In\r\n1887 a law was passed requiring police matrons in all cities of 30,000\r\ninhabitants or more. There had been matrons in Boston fifteen years.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the Supreme Court decided that a woman could not act as notary\r\npublic. In 1891 it was enacted that there should be women factory\r\ninspectors; in 1895 that a woman could be appointed assistant town or\r\ncity clerk; in 1896 that county commissioners might appoint a woman\r\nclerk _pro tempore_!\r\n\r\nThe evolution of the Special Commissioner shows the laborious\r\nprocesses by which women make any gains in Massachusetts. In 1883 a\r\nlaw was passed that women attorneys could be appointed Special\r\nCommissioners to administer oaths, take depositions and acknowledge\r\ndeeds. In 1889 it was amended to give Special Commissioners the same\r\npowers as justices of the peace in the above respects and also that of\r\nissuing summonses for witnesses. In 1896 it was provided that any\r\nwoman over twenty-one, the same as any man, whether a lawyer or not,\r\ncould be appointed commissioner; a change of name by marriage should\r\nterminate her commission but should not disqualify her for\r\nre-appointment. In 1898 the powers were extended to appointments of\r\nappraisers of estates. In 1899 the powers of the Special Commissioner\r\nwere made coincident with those of justice of the peace, but the\r\nauthority to perform the marriage ceremony was taken from justices\r\ngenerally and is now given to specified ones only.\r\n\r\nWomen can not be justices of the peace. They may be appointed by the\r\nState to take acknowledgments of deeds but not to perform the marriage\r\nceremony unless regularly ordained ministers.\r\n\r\nWomen at present are serving on State Boards as follows: Commissioners\r\nof Prisons, Charity and Free Public Library--two each; trustees of\r\nInsane Hospitals at Danvers, Northampton, Taunton, Worcester and\r\nMedfield--two each, and at Westborough, three; School for\r\nFeeble-minded, one; Hospital for Epileptics, two; for Dipsomaniacs and\r\nInebriates, one; Hospital Cottages for Children, one; State Hospital\r\nand State Farm, two; Lyman and Industrial Schools, two.\r\n\r\nIt has been impossible to ascertain the number of women serving as\r\nSchool Trustees later than 1898. Then the records showed 194 on boards\r\nin 138 towns, but, as in many cases only the initials of the prefixes\r\nto the names were given, this is probably an underestimate. Women\r\nserve on the boards of public libraries.\r\n\r\nWomen are found in the following official positions in Boston:\r\ntrustees of public institutions, two; of children's institutions,\r\nthree; of insane hospitals, two; of bath departments, two; overseers\r\nof the poor, two; city conveyancer in law department, one; Superior\r\nCourt stenographer, one; probation officers, two; chief matron House\r\nof Detention, one; supervisor of schools, one; members of school\r\ncommittee, four.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: Massachusetts claims the first woman who ever practiced\r\nmedicine in the United States--Dr. Harriot K. Hunt, who studied with\r\nher father and began in 1835, long before a medical college in the\r\ncountry was open to women. In 1881 Lelia J. Robinson applied for\r\nadmission to the bar in Boston and the Supreme Court decided a woman\r\nto be ineligible. The Legislature of 1892 enacted that women should be\r\nadmitted to the practice of law. No professions or occupations are now\r\nlegally forbidden to them.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: One of the first seminaries for women in the United States\r\nwas Mt. Holyoke at South Hadley, Mass., now a college with 550\r\nstudents; the largest college for women in the world is Smith at\r\nNorthampton, with 1,131 students; one that ranks among the four\r\nhighest in existence, Wellesley, has 819; Radcliffe at Cambridge, has\r\n407. The requirements of admission and the examinations are the same\r\nfor Radcliffe as for Harvard and the courses of instruction are\r\nidentical. The teaching is done by members of the Harvard faculty,\r\nover one hundred of them. All degrees must be approved by the\r\nPresident and Fellows of Harvard, the diplomas are countersigned by\r\nthe President and bear the University seal. Nevertheless Radcliffe is\r\nnot recognized as having any official connection with the ancient\r\nuniversity. A number of graduate courses in Harvard are open to women\r\nbut without degrees.\r\n\r\nBoston University, with 1,430 students, is co-educational in all its\r\ndepartments, including law, medicine and theology. The same is true of\r\nthe Massachusetts Institute of Technology and the State Agricultural\r\nCollege. There has been no distinction of sex in Tufts College\r\n(Univers.) since 1892; or in Clark University (post-graduate) in\r\nWorcester, since 1900. The College of Physicians and Surgeons and\r\nTufts Colleges of Medicine and Surgery, in Boston, admit women. They\r\nare excluded from Andover Theological Seminary (Cong'l), Newton\r\nTheological Institute (Baptist), Amherst College, Williams College and\r\nWorcester Polytechnic Institute.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 1,197 men and 12,205 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $136.23; of the women,\r\n$51.41. Omitting the High School salaries, the average amount paid to\r\nmen per month is $130.09; to women, $49.61. In some counties over\r\none-half as much is paid to women teachers as to men, but in Essex\r\nCounty the monthly ratio is $127.82 to men, and $47.17 to women, and\r\nin Suffolk County $200.07 to men and $63.44, or less than one-third,\r\nto women. Boston has 215 men teachers at an average monthly salary of\r\n$213.61; and 1,762 women at an average of $69.68. In no other State is\r\nthe discrepancy so great in the salary of men and women teachers.\r\n\r\nThe women's clubs of Massachusetts are as the sands of the sea. Of\r\nthese 169, with a membership of 21,451, belong to the State\r\nFederation. The New England Woman's Club was organized in 1868, the\r\nsame year as Sorosis in New York and about one month earlier. These\r\ntwo are generally spoken of as the pioneers of women's clubs as they\r\nexist to-day.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION OF MASSACHUSETTS.[328]\r\n\r\nWhen the third volume of the History of Woman Suffrage closed in 1885\r\nit left this association three years old, with Mrs. Harriette Robinson\r\nShattuck, president, Dr. Salome Merritt, vice-president, and thirteen\r\nother vice-presidents who represented the same number of counties. To\r\nthese leaders and others it seemed necessary that Massachusetts should\r\nhave this society in order to give a support to the officers and the\r\nmethods of the National Woman Suffrage Association, which they were\r\nnot receiving from the State society, at that time auxiliary to the\r\nAmerican Association. In those three years conventions had been held\r\nin some twenty cities.\r\n\r\nMrs. Harriet M. Emerson was then engaged in preparing petitions, to\r\nwhich she secured many signers, asking for \"a statute to enable a\r\nwidow who desires it, to become on reasonable terms a co-executor with\r\nthose appointed by her husband's will.\" For several years she spent\r\nmuch time on this work and had the help of many of the best citizens\r\nof Boston. It was ably presented at each session of the Legislature,\r\nbut no action was taken.[329]\r\n\r\nMrs. Harriet H. Robinson, the corresponding secretary, has published\r\nMassachusetts in the Woman Suffrage Movement, The New Pandora, a\r\nwoman's play, Capt. Mary Miller, etc.; Mrs. Shattuck, The Woman's\r\nManual of Parliamentary Law, Advanced Rules for Large Assemblies.\r\nAnother member, Mrs. Sara A. Underwood, has done valuable work on the\r\nnewspapers of Boston, New York and other cities, and before the\r\nLegislature. The writings of Mrs. Evaleen L. Mason are well known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  HARRIET MAY MILLS.\r\n  Syracuse, N. Y.\r\n\r\n          FLORENCE HOWE HALL.\r\n          Plainfield, N. J.\r\n\r\n      REV. ANNA GARLIN SPENCER.\r\n      Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\n  LUCRETIA L. BLANKENBURG.\r\n  Philadelphia, Pa.\r\n\r\n          LAVINA A. HATCH.\r\n          E. Pembroke, Mass.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nIn 1888 certain historical text-books which were objected to by the\r\nRoman Catholics were removed from the schools and replaced by others.\r\nThis caused great excitement, over 25,000 women registered to vote,\r\nand for two successive years helped to defeat all the Catholic\r\ncandidates for the school board and to elect a number of women. The\r\nmembers of this association maintained the non-partisan side and\r\nopposed the extremists who urged that Catholics should be excluded\r\nfrom the board, thus depriving it of some of its most experienced and\r\nfaithful men.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1888, the association applied for a charter and became the\r\nfirst incorporated body of woman suffragists in the State. In December\r\na petition was sent to Congress asking for an amendment to the United\r\nStates Constitution prohibiting disfranchisement on account of sex.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 a petition from this association was introduced in the\r\nLegislature to require assessors to ask at every house whether there\r\nare women there who wish to be assessed a poll tax. A petition was\r\nalso sent in for a law providing that one-third of the membership of\r\nthe school committee consist of women. These were presented by Mr.\r\nBarker of Malden.\r\n\r\nAt the eighth annual meeting in May, 1890, C. W. Ernst gave an\r\ninstructive address on political topics.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1891, a special meeting was called to discuss the question\r\nof discontinuing auxiliaryship to the National-American Association,\r\nand continuing work as an independent organization. After a full\r\ndiscussion the vote resulted in remaining auxiliary, only one opposed.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1892, a plan was laid before the association by Dr. Merritt\r\nfor action in the various cities and towns of the State to secure the\r\nnomination in caucuses of such senators and representatives only as\r\nwould declare themselves in favor of woman suffrage. A committee was\r\nformed to confer with other organizations, and at the next meeting it\r\nreported that the Boston Suffrage League, Mrs. Ellen Battelle\r\nDietrick, president, had approved the plan and called a meeting where\r\nnine wards were represented and a compact signed. In May this\r\nagreement was adopted by the Suffolk County Committee, who were to\r\nwork in Boston while the association was to manage outside counties.\r\nOne thousand copies were printed and circulated but the final results\r\nshowed not enough interest to make the measure a success.\r\n\r\nAt this time Mrs. Shattuck resigned the presidency, \"being engaged in\r\nwork more imperative,\" and Mrs. Robinson gave up her office of\r\ncorresponding secretary. At the October meeting Miss Hatch was elected\r\na member of the executive committee of the National Association for\r\nthe Columbian Exposition. Mrs. Sarah A. P. Dickerman acted as\r\npresident during the remainder of the year. Valuable discussions were\r\nheld on State and National Banks, Should the Governor Exercise the\r\nVeto Power? Shall Immigration Be Restricted? Which Would Benefit\r\nBoston Most, License or No License? and other timely questions.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1893, it was voted to petition the Legislature that women\r\nbe allowed to vote on a constitutional amendment affecting their\r\nproperty rights. A special effort was made in petition work both for\r\nCongress and the Legislature. In one small village where forty-two\r\nsignatures were obtained, only four persons refused to sign. In May\r\nDr. Merritt was unanimously elected president of the association, and\r\nremained in office until her death in 1900. At this meeting a\r\nstatement was made that in Massachusetts there were from 105,000 to\r\n110,000 families with widows or single women as heads, not represented\r\nby one vote. In December a committee was appointed to confer with the\r\nlegislative committee of the State School Suffrage Association to\r\nsecure an extension of the time (then only two or three days) which\r\nwas allotted to the registration of women.\r\n\r\nAt the legislative hearing in January, 1894, petitions were presented\r\nby this association from seven counties, covering twenty-one towns. At\r\nthis date 186 women were reported as holding office, eleven being\r\ndistrict superintendents of schools. The following May the\r\nregistration laws were so changed that women have since had the same\r\ntime as men in which to register. Under the present law, the assessors\r\nin their regular rounds are required to take the names of women voters\r\nhaving the same residence as on a previous voting list. These are then\r\nentered on the register for the ensuing campaign without further\r\ntrouble.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1895, a special meeting was called to decide how best to\r\nhelp the work for the referendum which had been submitted by the\r\nLegislature in order to ascertain how many women desired to vote.\r\nTwenty-five dollars were appropriated toward defraying the expenses of\r\nthe State committee appointed to conduct this campaign.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 much time was spent on measures helpful to women and children.\r\nOne of these was to secure the early closing of stores, the result\r\nbeing that through the entire summer all the principal stores in\r\nBoston were closed at 5 P. M. every day, and on Saturdays at 12 M., as\r\nthey have been each summer since.\r\n\r\n\r\nHouse Bill 625 of 1896 started with a most innocent appearance under\r\nthe title, \"A bill to enlarge the powers of the police commissioners\r\nof Boston.\" In reality it asked that the powers of the police force be\r\nso extended as to allow them to issue permits for the keeping of\r\nhouses of ill-repute, with authority for their inspection and control.\r\nOther organizations joined this one in opposition, with the result\r\nthat the bill was defeated.\r\n\r\nThe association also advocated \"A bill to prohibit child insurance,\"\r\non account of the injury done to families by absorbing the means which\r\nshould be expended for food, clothes and other necessaries in the\r\npayment of policies. It was considered, moreover, in the nature of a\r\npremium for child murder by neglect.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting event of 1898 was the celebration of the fiftieth\r\nanniversary of the first woman's rights convention. Dr. Merritt spoke\r\nof the rise of the movement, saying that 1848 was as marked an epoch\r\nin the rights of women as was 1776 in the rights of men. Miss Hatch's\r\npaper gave the trend of events previous to the Seneca Falls\r\nConvention, showing that these molded public sentiment and gave rise\r\nto the calling of this memorable meeting. Speeches, letters from\r\nabsent members and a roll of honor, each giving the name of an old\r\nworker and adding appropriate remarks, followed.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the usual petitions was one to Congress in behalf of\r\nthe Hawaiian women. A protest was also sent against the admission to\r\nCongress of Brigham H. Roberts of Utah, a polygamist and an enemy to\r\nwoman suffrage.\r\n\r\nSince 1884 this association has held 128 public meetings. It has been\r\nrepresented by active working delegates at every convention of the\r\nNational Association since becoming an auxiliary in 1882. The\r\nrecording secretary has held that office for seventeen years, never\r\nhaving been absent from a monthly meeting unless because of illness or\r\nattendance at the national conventions. She has been a delegate to the\r\nlatter for fourteen years.\r\n\r\nThis association did much pioneer press work. From its first session a\r\nreport of the same, with items made up of whatever had occurred in any\r\npart of the world advantageous to woman's advancement since the\r\nprevious meeting, has appeared next day in the leading Boston dailies,\r\nwith scarcely an omission during the eighteen years.\r\n\r\nBesides those already mentioned the following have held office and\r\nbeen faithful workers: Mesdames A. M. Mahony, Sarah A. Rand and Lydia\r\nL. Hutchins; and the Misses Hannah M. Todd, Elizabeth B. Atwill,\r\nCharlotte Lobdell, Agnes G. Parrott and Sophia M. Hale. In 1901 the\r\nsociety united with the Massachusetts State Association.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[303] The History is indebted for the material for this chapter to\r\nMiss Alice Stone Blackwell, editor of the _Woman's Journal_ (Boston)\r\nand recording secretary of the National American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation since 1890.

The vice presidents are\r\nthe presidents and prominent members of the New England State\r\nAssociations.\r\n\r\n[315] Limited space has prevented any résumé of the speeches made\r\nduring these years in the conventions or before the legislative\r\ncommittees. The reader is referred to the files of the _Woman's\r\nJournal_ which have been placed in a number of public libraries. The\r\nnames of legislators who have advocated woman suffrage will be found\r\nat the close of Legislative Action.\r\n\r\n[316] The one to the Republican members was signed by Alanson W.\r\nBeard, William Claflin, William W. Crapo, Henry L. Dawes, Frank P.\r\nGoulding, Thomas N. Hart, George F. Hoar, John D. Long, Samuel May,\r\nAdin Thayer and John G. Whittier; the other to the Democratic by\r\nJosiah G. Abbott, Edward Avery, John M. Corse, John E. Fitzgerald,\r\nJohn Hopkins, George E. McNeil, Bushrod Morse, Frederick O. Prince,\r\nAlbert Palmer and Charles H. Taylor.\r\n\r\n[317] These letters have been doing duty ever since, being quoted in\r\nadverse reports of congressional committees, Legislatures, speeches\r\nand documents of the opponents, etc.\r\n\r\n[318] This was the last time Lucy Stone addressed a legislative\r\ncommittee. She had presented her first plea in 1857. Every year since\r\n1869 she had made her annual pilgrimage to the State House to ask for\r\nthe rights of women.\r\n\r\n[319] The remonstrants in past years had gone repeatedly before\r\nlegislative committees, and since 1897 they have appeared and spoken\r\nevery year in opposition to any form of suffrage for women.\r\n\r\n[320] Mr. Saunders, when asked by a reporter of the Boston _Record_ if\r\nit was true that he received $150 per month for his services, declined\r\nto say, but stated that he should consider that a small amount, as he\r\nwas giving practically all of his time and effort.\r\n\r\n[321] The M. A. O. F. E. S. W. says that this was not done by the\r\nassociation officially. It was certainly done by some of its prominent\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n[322] On one occasion, after Mrs. Julia Ward Howe and her associates\r\nhad made their appeals, Mr. Keenan referred to them in the legislative\r\ndebate as \"women masquerading in pants,\" and said, \"I never knew a\r\nwoman who loved her children or her home that wanted to vote.\"\r\n\r\n[323] Dr. Lyman Abbott of New York, Miss Heloise E. Hersey, Miss Sarah\r\nE. Hunt, Mesdames Barrett Wendell, W. W. Vaughan, Judith Andrews,\r\nNathaniel Payne, James H. Robbins, Frank B. Fay and Henry Thompson\r\nalso \"remonstrated.\"\r\n\r\n[324] It seems desirable to preserve the names of those who have\r\nchampioned and voted for a measure so bitterly opposed. Those of the\r\neighty four opponents may drop into oblivion. Honor roll Senators S.\r\nStillman Blanchard, Arthur B. Breed, Gorham D. Gilman, Robert S. Gray,\r\nCharles H. Innes, Francis W.

During the past thirty\r\nyears the State Suffrage Association has repeatedly petitioned the\r\nLegislature to this effect. In 1902 many other organizations joined in\r\nthe effort, and the petition for equal guardianship was indorsed by\r\n34,000 women. The Committee on Probate and Chancery reported\r\nadversely. Representative George H. Fall's Equal Guardianship Bill was\r\ndebated on two days and finally passed both Houses and was signed by\r\nGov. W. Murray Crane in June.\r\n\r\nThe only society of women that has ever ranged itself publicly on the\r\nopposing side of this question is the Massachusetts Anti-Suffrage\r\nAssociation. For years it circulated with its official imprint a\r\nleaflet in defense of the law which excluded mothers from the custody\r\nand guardianship of their children.\r\n\r\n[326] For information in regard to the laws the History is indebted to\r\nMrs. Anna Christy (George H.) Fall, a practicing lawyer of Malden.\r\n\r\n[327] This was purely class legislation, as the woman who had paid\r\nproperty tax was not required to pay poll-tax, and poor women could\r\nnot vote without paying two dollars each year. The law was not asked\r\nfor by the Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[328] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Lavina Allen\r\nHatch of East Pembroke, recording secretary of the association from\r\nits beginning in 1882, and also corresponding secretary from 1892.\r\n\r\n[329] In 1884 the Boston Political Class was formed as an auxiliary.\r\nWhile the idea of such an educational scheme originated with Sara A.\r\nUnderwood, its successful development is due to Harriette Robinson\r\nShattuck, who became president of the class. Lavina Allen Hatch kept\r\nits records, and Dora Bascom Smith gave the use of her parlors for its\r\nfortnightly meetings.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVI.\r\n\r\nMICHIGAN.[330]\r\n\r\n\r\nFrom the time of the defeat of the suffrage amendment to the State\r\nconstitution in 1874 there was no central organization in Michigan for\r\nten years, although a few local societies maintained an existence.\r\nThrough a conjunction of these forces a convention was called at\r\nFlint, May 21, 1884, which resulted in the forming of a State Equal\r\nSuffrage Association, officered as follows: President, Mary L. Doe;\r\nvice-president, Gov. Josiah W. Begole; corresponding secretary, Nellie\r\nWalker; recording secretary, Fannie Holden Fowler; treasurer, Cordelia\r\nF. Briggs.\r\n\r\nThe second State convention was held in Grand Rapids, Oct. 7-9, 1885,\r\nwith Lucy Stone and Henry B. Blackwell in attendance. Letters were\r\nreceived from Susan B. Anthony, president of the National Association,\r\nand Thomas W. Palmer, U. S. Senator from Michigan. The latter said: \"I\r\nhope that you will put forward the economic aspect of the\r\nquestion--its effect upon taxation. Women are the natural economists.\"\r\n\r\nIn lieu of the annual meeting in 1886 four political State\r\nconventions--Prohibition, Greenback, Republican and Democratic--were\r\nmemorialized for a plank indorsing a Municipal Suffrage Bill. Sarah E.\r\nV. Emery appeared before the Prohibition convention, which adopted the\r\nplank. She also attended the Democratic, where she was invited to the\r\nplatform and made a vigorous speech, which was received with applause,\r\nbut the suffrage resolution was not adopted. Emily B. Ketcham attended\r\nthe Republican convention but was refused a hearing before the\r\nCommittee on Resolutions. After its report had been accepted friends\r\nobtained an opportunity for her to address the meeting, but she was\r\nreceived with considerable discourtesy. Mrs. Fowler secured the\r\nadoption of the plank by the Greenback convention.\r\n\r\nThe association met in the State House at Lansing, Jan. 13, 14, 1887.\r\nMiss Anthony, vice-president-at-large of the National Association,\r\ngave an address in Representative Hall. She was introduced by Gov.\r\nCyrus G. Luce, and many senators and representatives were in the\r\naudience.[331]\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1888 took place in Bay City, June 6-8. The Rev. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw and Helen M. Gougar of Indiana addressed large audiences\r\nin the opera house on successive evenings. Immediately afterward a\r\nseries of two days' meetings was held by Mrs. Gougar, assisted by May\r\nStocking Knaggs, at Saginaw, Flint, Port Huron, Detroit, Battle Creek\r\nand Grand Rapids, societies being organized at several places.\r\n\r\nIn November the Association for the Advancement of Women met in\r\nDetroit. Many suffragists were in attendance and the State president,\r\nMrs. Doe, called a council in the parlors of the Church of Our Father.\r\nFifty responded and it was unanimously decided to renew the effort for\r\nMunicipal Suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting was held in the State House at Lansing, Jan. 19-21,\r\n1889. A letter was received from Senator Palmer, enclosing a draft for\r\n$100 and saying: \"Equal suffrage in municipal affairs means better\r\nstatutes, better ordinances, better officers, better administration,\r\nlower taxation, happier homes and a better race.\" This generous gift\r\nenabled the association to keep a committee--Helen Philleo Jenkins,\r\nHarriet A. Cook, Mrs. Ketcham and Mrs. Knaggs--at the capital for\r\nseveral weeks, where they worked systematically to convert members and\r\nto secure victory.\r\n\r\nThe convention met at Detroit, Feb. 13, 14, 1890. Mrs. Doe, who had\r\nbeen the leader of the State forces since their organization, declined\r\nrenomination and Mrs. Jenkins was chosen president.\r\n\r\nThe association convened at Lansing again Feb. 10-12, 1891; and its\r\nspeakers were given a joint hearing in Representative Hall on the\r\nMunicipal Suffrage Bill, which was then before the Legislature.\r\nAddresses were made by Harriet J. Boutelle, Belle M. Perry, Sarah E.\r\nV. Emery and Martha Snyder Root.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony was present at the State convention, which took place in\r\nBattle Creek, May 4, 5, 1892. Articles of incorporation were adopted\r\nand Mrs. Ketcham was elected president.\r\n\r\nIn June the State Republican Convention met at East Saginaw. Mrs.\r\nKetcham, with Mrs. Doe, chairman of the legislative committee, pleaded\r\nbefore the Committee on Resolutions for recognition of this measure.\r\nThey were courteously treated and when about to retire their opinion\r\nwas asked on a list of resolutions presented from Genesee County,\r\n_viz._: That women professors be appointed at Michigan University\r\nuntil their number should bear a fair proportion to the number of\r\nwomen students; that women be appointed on boards of control of the\r\nState penal, reformatory and charitable institutions; that Municipal\r\nSuffrage for women be recommended, and that an amendment to the State\r\nconstitution, striking out the word \"male\" as a qualification for\r\nvoters, be submitted to the electors. The ladies indorsed all except\r\nthe fourth proposition, but none of them was adopted.\r\n\r\nAfter the nominations for the Legislature had been made, letters were\r\nwritten to candidates of all parties to ascertain their attitude\r\ntoward the Municipal Suffrage Bill. Many favorable and some evasive\r\nreplies were received, while not a few letters were wholly ignored. A\r\nsuffrage lecture course was arranged in eight cities, from November,\r\n1892, to March, 1893, inclusive, with Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw,\r\npresident and vice-president-at-large of the National Association and\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the organization committee, Mrs.\r\nClara Bewick Colby of Washington, D. C., and Mrs. Lida A. Meriwether\r\nof Tennessee, as speakers.\r\n\r\nThe next annual convention was held in the Capitol, Feb. 1-3, 1893.\r\nMrs. Colby had preceded it in January with her address on Wyoming,\r\ngiven in Representative Hall, the facts and figures of which left a\r\nstrong impression.[332] The speakers addressed the Legislature in\r\nbehalf of the Municipal Suffrage Bill.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1894, Miss Anthony lectured at Ann Arbor before the\r\nUniversity Association. By the efforts of Mrs. Olivia B. Hall, her\r\nhostess and friend of many years, preparations had been made for a\r\nmass meeting, in which the State E. S. A. participated, Miss Shaw also\r\nbeing present. It convened in Newberry Hall, January 15-17, with a\r\nlarge attendance and resulted in the organization of the Ann Arbor E.\r\nS. A., with one hundred members and Mrs. Hall as president. On the\r\nlast evening she gave a large reception at her home in honor of the\r\ntwo ladies, which was attended by President and Mrs. George B. Angell\r\nand many of the university faculty.\r\n\r\nThis year's convention assembled at Grand Rapids, May 7-10, with the\r\nRev. Ida C. Hultin of Illinois as the principal speaker.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of 1895 took place at Saginaw, May 7-9. In the evening\r\nRepresentative George H. Waldo gave a review of his efforts in behalf\r\nof the Equal Suffrage Bill, and an enthusiastic indorsement of the\r\nmeasure. This convention had the assistance of Mrs. Chapman Catt, who\r\nmade the chief address. Mrs. Ketcham retired from the presidency and\r\nthe association elected Mrs. Knaggs. A new standing committee of five\r\nwas appointed to secure women physicians and attendants in public\r\ninstitutions for the care of women and girls. After adjournment the\r\nSaginaw Political Equality Club was formed.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the State convention met in Pontiac, May 19-22. Senator Palmer\r\nwas the orator of the occasion.\r\n\r\nThe following July Mrs. Knaggs and Carrie C. Faxon addressed the\r\nDemocratic State Convention at Bay City, through the courtesy of the\r\nHons. John Donovan and O'Brien J. Atkinson. They were accorded an\r\nattentive hearing with much applause, and given a rising vote of\r\nthanks, emphasized by an exhortation from the chairman, the Hon.\r\nThomas Barkworth, that the party prepare to concede to the women of\r\nthe State their political rights.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1897 took place in Vermontville, May 11-13. On\r\nNovember 22, 23, a national conference was held in Grand Rapids by\r\nMiss Anthony, Miss Shaw and Mrs. Chapman Catt, together with the\r\nofficers of the State association and many other Michigan women.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the convention met in Bay City, May 3-5. On the last evening\r\nMrs. May Wright Sewall of Indiana gave a brilliant address on The\r\nDuties of Women Considered as Patriots. Its strong peace sentiments\r\naroused deep interest, as this was at the beginning of the\r\nSpanish-American War.\r\n\r\nThe invitation of the Susan B. Anthony Club of Grand Rapids to the\r\nNational W. S. A., to hold its annual convention in that city in 1899,\r\nhaving been accepted, the date was fixed for April 27 to May 3,\r\ninclusive, and it was decided that the State meeting should\r\nimmediately follow. This national gathering was full of interest,\r\naffording as it did an opportunity of attendance to many women of the\r\nState who were unable to go to the convention at Washington.[333]\r\nGrand Rapids women were generous in their hospitality, all visitors\r\nbeing entertained free of expense. The executive ability of Mrs.\r\nKetcham was evident from first to last. The State association held a\r\nbusiness session May 4, and was addressed by Mr. Blackwell and Mrs.\r\nColby. Mrs. Lenore Starker Bliss was elected president.\r\n\r\nAn immediate result of the national meeting was the organization of\r\nthe Anna Shaw Junior Equal Suffrage Club of Grand Rapids, with\r\nseventeen youthful members.\r\n\r\nIn December the American Federation of Labor held its annual\r\nconvention in Detroit. Miss Anthony addressed it by invitation and\r\nurged the members to adopt a resolution asking Congress for a\r\nSixteenth Amendment forbidding the disfranchisement of United States\r\ncitizens on account of sex. Her speech was most enthusiastically\r\nreceived and the resolution she offered was immediately adopted, and,\r\nin the form of a petition which represented nearly 1,000,000 members,\r\nduly forwarded to Congress.\r\n\r\nPrior to the State convention of 1900 Mrs. Chapman Catt, assisted by\r\nMiss Shaw, Miss Harriet May Mills of New York and Mrs. Root, held two\r\ndays' conventions at Hillsdale, Battle Creek, Kalamazoo and Ann Arbor,\r\norganizing suffrage clubs at the first three places. The annual\r\nmeeting convened in Detroit, May 15-17, Miss Shaw and Mrs. Chapman\r\nCatt giving addresses on consecutive evenings. Mrs. Bliss declining\r\nrenomination, Mrs. Ketcham was unanimously replaced at the head of the\r\nState association.[334]\r\n\r\nIn July, at the request of Miss Anthony, the Columbia Catholic Summer\r\nSchool held in Detroit extended an invitation for a speech on\r\nsuffrage. Mrs. Chapman Catt was selected, all arrangements being made\r\nby Mrs. Jenkins and others. Father W. J. Dalton, who introduced her,\r\nsaid he hoped to see women voting and filling all offices, even that\r\nof police commissioner.\r\n\r\nThe Greenback and the People's parties have welcomed women as\r\nassistants. Prominent among these have been Marian Todd, Martha E.\r\nStrickland and Elizabeth Eaglesfield. In 1896 Mrs. Emery and Mrs. Root\r\nwere placed upon the State Central Committee of the People's Party.\r\nThe Prohibitionists also have received women as party workers.\r\n\r\nBesides those already named, others who have been foremost in every\r\nplan to forward equality for women are Giles B. and Catharine A. F.\r\nStebbins, Sara Philleo Skinner, Lila E. Bliss, H. Margaret Downs,\r\nDelisle P. Holmes, Wesley Emery, Brent Harding, Smith G. Ketcham and\r\nJohn Wesley Knaggs; among the younger women, Florence Jenkins Spalding\r\nand Edith Frances Hall.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: Prior to 1885 the charters of twelve cities made\r\ninoperative the early State law which gave School Suffrage to women.\r\nBy appealing to the Legislature of that year the charters of Grand\r\nRapids and Bay City were so amended that the right to vote at school\r\nmeetings was conferred upon women.\r\n\r\nThe new State association organized in 1884 adopted as its principal\r\nplan of work a bill which had been drawn by the Hon. Samuel Fowler and\r\nintroduced in the Legislature of 1883, to grant Municipal Suffrage to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 this bill was presented in the Senate by John W. Belknap, a\r\nstrong supporter. Independent of the State association, Theodore G.\r\nHouk introduced in the House a joint resolution to strike the word\r\n\"male\" from the constitution. The Joint Judiciary Committees granted a\r\nhearing to the friends of woman suffrage in February. The Municipal\r\nBill came to a vote in the Senate on May 21, which resulted in 14\r\nayes, 15 noes, but was not acted upon in the House. The Houk joint\r\nresolution passed the House by 81 ayes, 10 noes, but was not brought\r\nup in the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the Municipal Suffrage Bill was again taken up, being\r\nintroduced simultaneously in both Houses, in the lower by Henry\r\nWatson, in the upper by Charles J. Monroe, both staunch friends. A\r\nhearing was had before the Senate Judiciary and the House Committee on\r\nElections in March. Miss Frances E. Willard aided the suffragists by a\r\nbrief address. On April 12 the House committee reported in favor of\r\nstriking out all after the enacting clause, thus completely\r\nobliterating the bill, which report was accepted by a vote of 50 ayes,\r\n33 noes. The Senate Bill was not considered.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the Municipal Suffrage Bill was introduced in the Senate by\r\nArthur D. Gilmore and in the House by Dr. James B. F. Curtis. It was\r\nreferred to the Judiciary Committees, and at their request the hearing\r\nwas had before the entire Legislature during the annual convention of\r\nthe State E. S. A. No outside lecturers were invited, because the\r\nfriends of the measure were met by a strongly-expressed wish that the\r\nwomen of Michigan should speak for themselves. Short speeches were\r\nmade by May Stocking Knaggs, Catharine A. F. Stebbins, Emily B.\r\nKetcham, Lucy F. Andrews, Elizabeth Eaglesfield, Frances Riddle\r\nStafford, Harriet A. Cook, Mrs. R. M. Kellogg, Phebe B. Whitfield and\r\nMary B. Clay of Kentucky who was then residing in the State. Mrs.\r\nClara Bewick Colby being present, she was invited to make the closing\r\nremarks.\r\n\r\nJust before this hearing the bevy of officers and speakers passing\r\nthrough the corridor on their way to the House were warned by Joseph\r\nGreusel, a friendly journalist, that a circular of protest had been\r\nplaced upon the desk of each member. This was headed: \"Massachusetts\r\nRemonstrants against Woman Suffrage, to the Members of the Michigan\r\nLegislature;\" and contained the familiar array of misrepresentations.\r\nWith the co-operation of Lucy Stone, a reply was printed immediately\r\nafter the convention and likewise distributed in the Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe House Bill remained under the judicious guardianship of Dr.\r\nCurtis. The chairman of the legislative committee, Mrs. Knaggs, was in\r\nconstant attendance and secured valuable information on the practical\r\nworking of Municipal Suffrage from Gov. Lyman U. Humphrey,\r\nAttorney-General Simeon B. Bradford, ex-Attorney-General L. B. Kellogg\r\nand Laura M. Johns, all of Kansas. The Hon. Charles B. Waite of\r\nChicago prepared by request an exhaustive legal opinion on The Power\r\nof the Legislature of Michigan in Reference to Municipal Suffrage. The\r\nJudiciary Committee--John V. B. Goodrich, Russell R. Pealer, Byron S.\r\nWaite, Norris J. Brown, Oliver S. Smith, Thomas C. Taylor, James A.\r\nRandall--gave a unanimous report in favor of the bill, which included\r\nthis opinion and the Kansas reports. Senator Thomas W. Palmer, who had\r\nbeen appointed Minister to Spain, went to Lansing on the very eve of\r\nleaving this country and, in an address to the joint Houses of the\r\nLegislature, made a strong plea for the measure.\r\n\r\nAs the day fixed for the consideration of the bill approached, the\r\nsuffrage committee found itself confronted by an arrangement, quietly\r\nmade by the opponents, to have an address delivered in Representative\r\nHall by a Mrs. Mary Livermore, who had been holding parlor meetings in\r\nDetroit for pay and speaking against woman suffrage; and the false\r\nreport was industriously circulated that this was the great suffragist\r\nof like name, who had discarded her lifelong convictions and gone over\r\nto the enemy.\r\n\r\nThe bill was considered May 15, 1889. By the courtesy of J. B.\r\nMulliken, general manager of the D. L. and N. R. R., a special train\r\nwhich carried a large delegation of women was sent from Detroit. Some\r\ncame from other parts of the State and the societies of Lansing were\r\nwell represented. The galleries were filled and the floor of the House\r\nwas lined with interested women. After a largely favorable discussion\r\nthe vote was taken, resulting in 58 yeas, 34 noes. The bill was\r\nimmediately dispatched to the Senate. That body lost no time, but at\r\nonce brought the measure under consideration and after a brief\r\ndiscussion it was defeated by one vote--11 ayes, 12 noes.[335]\r\n\r\nThat evening Mrs. Livermore gave her belated dissertation and, upon\r\nmotion, was followed by Adele Hazlitt, who with great courtesy slew\r\nher weak arguments.\r\n\r\nAt this session the charters of East Saginaw and Detroit were amended\r\nto give women of those cities the school ballot; the former through\r\nthe efforts of Representative Rowland Connor.[336]\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the Municipal Suffrage Bill was again presented to the\r\nLegislature, in the House by Samuel Miller and in the Senate by Alfred\r\nMilnes, both champions of the measure. The State suffrage convention\r\nwas in session at the capital February 10-12, and the Legislature gave\r\na joint hearing in Representative Hall to its speakers, all Michigan\r\nwomen. The Senate Bill was taken up March 25, discussed and lost by 14\r\nayes, 12 noes. It was then tabled and taken up again May 13, receiving\r\n14 ayes, 15 noes. Just prior to this consideration of the bill\r\nninety-five petitions in its favor, representing eighty-eight towns\r\nand bearing several thousand signatures, were presented.\r\n\r\nThis discussion was the most trying of all during the ten years of\r\neffort to secure Municipal Suffrage, owing to the character of the\r\nchief opponent, Senator Frank Smith, who represented the basest\r\nelements of Detroit. Knowing his illiteracy, the reporters had\r\nexpected much sport by sending his speech to the papers in full, but\r\nin the interests of decency they refrained from publishing it. Women\r\ncame down from the galleries white with anger and disgust, and avowed\r\nthat if they never had wanted the ballot before they wanted it now.\r\nThe suffrage committee received many friendly courtesies from\r\nLieut.-Gov. John Strong, besides a substantial gift of money. When\r\nasked for the use of the Senate Chamber for one evening of the\r\nconvention he said: \"Certainly; your money helped to build the State\r\nHouse. You have as much right to it as any of us.\"\r\n\r\nIn March, 1893, the bill was introduced by Henry Wirt Newkirk in the\r\nHouse and Samuel W. Hopkins in the Senate. Both were lawyers of\r\ndistinguished ability, and among the most earnest advocates the\r\nmeasure ever had. The State suffrage convention was in session while\r\nit was being considered. The Rev. Anna Howard Shaw and the Rev.\r\nCaroline Bartlett made addresses before the Legislature, the latter\r\nspeaking on Woman's Legitimate and Illegitimate Work in Politics.\r\nThese speeches took the place of the customary committee hearing. The\r\nevening before the bill was voted on Miss Anthony addressed the\r\nLegislature with her customary acumen and force.\r\n\r\nThe measure had been made the special order for 2:30 P. M. the next\r\nday. The House assembled at 2 o'clock. Following the roll-call the\r\nusual order was the presentation of petitions. At this time a member\r\nin the rear, at a sufficient distance from the Speaker's desk to give\r\nimpressiveness to what would follow, rose and presented \"A petition\r\nfrom the people of Chippewa County in favor of the Municipal Woman\r\nSuffrage Bill.\" A page sprang forward and taking the document, which\r\nwas prepared upon paper of an extra size and ornamented with long\r\nstreamers of red and green ribbons, ran with it to the clerk's desk,\r\nand that officer proceeded to read it at length, including a long list\r\nof signatures which comprised Patrick O'Shea, Annie Rooney, Spotted\r\nTail, etc. This petition was followed by two others of similar\r\ncharacter, bearing Indian names of such significance as the wit of the\r\nopposition could invent. After this dignified prelude the House\r\ndiscussed the measure at length, and defeated it by a vote of 38 ayes,\r\n39 noes. A reconsideration was moved and the bill tabled.\r\n\r\nThis Municipal Suffrage Bill was taken up again in May and passed the\r\nHouse on the 19th with an educational amendment: \"Women who are able\r\nto read the constitution of Michigan in the English language.\" The\r\nvote was 57 ayes, 25 noes. On May 25 it was considered in the Senate\r\nand, after a vigorous battle, was carried by a vote of 18 ayes, 11\r\nnoes. Gov. John T. Rich affixed his signature May 27, and apparent\r\nvictory was won after ten years of effort. Representative Newkirk and\r\nSenator Hopkins received the heartfelt gratitude of those for whom\r\nthey had given their ardent labors, and local societies held jubilee\r\nmeetings. The newspapers of the State were unanimous in expressing\r\nwelcome to the new class of voters.\r\n\r\nMary L. Doe started at once upon a tour for the purpose of organizing\r\nmunicipal franchise leagues for the study of city government, and\r\neverywhere was met with eager interest. She left a league in every\r\nplace she visited, men also joining in the plans for study. Thus in\r\nconscientious preparation for their new duties, women in the various\r\nmunicipalities passed the summer and early autumn of 1893.\r\n\r\nMayor Pingree of Detroit recognizing the new law, ordered a sufficient\r\nadditional number of registration books, but Edward H. Kennedy and\r\nHenry S. Potter, who were opposed to it, filed an injunction against\r\nHazen S. Pingree and the Common Council to restrain them from this\r\nextra purchase. Mary Stuart Coffin and Mary E. Burnett \"countered\" by\r\nfiling a mandamus September 30, to compel the election commissioners\r\nto provide means for carrying out the law. As these were cases for\r\ntesting the constitutionality of the law they were taken directly to\r\nthe Supreme Court. They were set for argument October 10, at 2 P. M.,\r\nbut a case of local interest was allowed to usurp the time till 4\r\no'clock, one hour only being left for the arguments with three\r\nadvocates on each side. Two of the women's lawyers, John B. Corliss\r\nand Henry A. Haigh, therefore filed briefs and gave their time to the\r\nfirst attorney, Col. John Atkinson.\r\n\r\nA decision was rendered October 24, the mandamus denied and the\r\ninjunction granted, all the judges concurring, on the ground that the\r\nLegislature had no authority to create a new class of voters. Those\r\nwho gave this decision were Chief Justice John W. McGrath and Justices\r\nFrank A. Hooker, John D. Long, Claudius B. Grant and Robert M.\r\nMontgomery.[337]\r\n\r\nIn spite of this Waterloo, the names of those men who, through the ten\r\nyears' struggle, in the various sessions of the Legislature, stood as\r\nchampions of the political rights of women, are cherished in memory.\r\nBesides those already given are Lieut-Gov. Archibald Butters,\r\nSenators Edwin G. Fox, James D. Turnbull, Charles H. McGinley and C.\r\nJ. Brundage, and Representative Fremont G. Chamberlain. In both\r\nHouses, session after session, there were many eloquent advocates of\r\nwoman's equality.\r\n\r\nNo further efforts have been made by women to secure the suffrage; but\r\nin 1895 George H. Waldo, without solicitation, introduced into the\r\nHouse a joint resolution to amend the constitution by striking out the\r\nword \"male.\" This was done in fulfilment of a promise to his mother\r\nand his wife, when nominated, to do all that he could to secure the\r\nenfranchisement of women if elected. Although the officers of the\r\nState association did not believe the time to be ripe for the\r\nsubmission of such an amendment, they could not withhold a friendly\r\nhand from so ardent and sincere a champion. The resolution was lost by\r\none vote.\r\n\r\nThis Legislature passed what was known as \"the blanket charter act,\"\r\nin which the substitution of \"and\" for \"or\" seemed so to affect the\r\nright of women to the school ballot in cities of the fourth class as\r\nto create a general disturbance. It resulted in an appeal to\r\nAttorney-General Fred A. Maynard, who rendered an opinion sustaining\r\nthe suffrage of women in those cities.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the main efforts of the association were directed toward\r\nsecuring a bill to place women on boards of control of the State\r\nAsylums for the Insane, and one to make mandatory the appointment of\r\nwomen physicians to take charge of women patients in these asylums and\r\nin the Home for the Feeble-Minded. These measures were both lost; but\r\non April 15 Governor Pingree appointed Jane M. Kinney to the Board of\r\nControl of the Eastern Michigan Asylum for the Insane at Pontiac for a\r\nterm of six years, and after twenty days' delay the Senate confirmed\r\nthe appointment.\r\n\r\nInterest was taken also in a bill requiring a police matron in towns\r\nof 10,000 inhabitants or more, which this year became law.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 a bill was again introduced into the Legislature to make\r\nmandatory the appointment of women physicians in asylums for the\r\ninsane, the Industrial Home for Girls, the Home for the Feeble-Minded,\r\nthe School for Deaf Mutes and the School for the Blind. This measure\r\nhad now enlisted the interest of the State Federation of Women's Clubs\r\nand many other organizations of women, and thousands of petitions\r\nwere presented. Emma J. Rose led the work of the women's clubs in its\r\nbehalf. It passed the Legislature and became a law.\r\n\r\nLAWS: In 1885 a law was enacted that manufacturers who employ women\r\nmust furnish seats for them; in 1889 that no girl under fifteen years\r\nof age should be employed in factories or stores for a longer period\r\nthan fifty-four hours in a single week; in 1893 that no woman under\r\ntwenty-one should be employed in any manufacturing establishment\r\nlonger than sixty hours in any one week; in 1895 that no woman under\r\ntwenty-one should be allowed to clean machinery while in motion.[338]\r\n\r\nA law enacted in 1897 prohibits the use of indecent, immoral, obscene\r\nor insulting language in the presence of any woman or child, with a\r\npenalty for its violation.\r\n\r\nDower but not curtesy obtains. The widow is entitled to the life use\r\nof one-third of the real estate, and to one-third of the rents, issues\r\nand profits of property not conveniently divisible, owned by her\r\nhusband. She may stay in the dwelling of her husband and receive\r\nreasonable support for one year. She is entitled to her apparel and\r\nornaments and those of her husband, $250 worth of his household\r\nfurniture and $200 worth of his other personal property, which she may\r\nselect. If he die without a will and there are no children she\r\ninherits one-half, and if there are no other heirs the whole of her\r\nhusband's real estate, and personal property, if the latter, after all\r\ndebts are paid, does not exceed $1,000. If there is excess of this it\r\nis distributed like real estate. This reservation is not made for the\r\nwidower, but \"no individual, under any circumstances, takes any larger\r\ninterest than the husband in the personal property of his deceased\r\nwife.\"\r\n\r\nWhere the wife has separate real estate she may sell, mortgage or\r\nbequeath it as if she were \"sole.\" The husband can not give full title\r\nto his real estate unless the wife joins so as to cut off her dower.\r\n\r\nThe wife's time, services, earnings and society belong to her husband,\r\nbut he may give to his wife her services rendered for another,\r\nwhether in his own household or elsewhere, so that she may recover for\r\nthem in her own name. Damages for the loss of such services and\r\nsociety, resulting from injuries inflicted upon the wife, belong to\r\nthe husband and are to be recovered in his own name. Her obligation to\r\nrender family services for him is co-extensive with his obligation to\r\nsupport her. She can sue in her own name for personal injuries.\r\n\r\nHusband and wife can not be partners in business; but of personal\r\nproperty owned by them jointly she is entitled to her share the same\r\nas if unmarried; and real estate held by them in fee or in joint\r\ntenancy goes entirely to the survivor without probate or other\r\nproceedings.\r\n\r\nA wife may become a sole trader with the husband's consent, or may\r\nform a business partnership with another. She can not become security.\r\n\r\nAll persons, except infants and married women and persons of unsound\r\nmind, may submit differences to arbitration.\r\n\r\nThe father is legally entitled to the custody of the persons and\r\neducation of minor children, and may appoint a guardian by will for\r\nthe minority even of one unborn, but the mother may present objections\r\nto the Probate Judge and appeal from his decision.\r\n\r\nThe husband must provide the necessities of life according to his\r\nstation and means while the wife remains in his domicile. If she is\r\ndeserted or non-supported, the Circuit Court of the county shall\r\nassign such part of his real or personal estate as it deems necessary\r\nfor her support, and may enforce the decree by sale of such real\r\nestate, which provision holds during their joint lives.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 14\r\nyears. In 1895 a bill to raise the age from 14 to 18 was introduced in\r\nthe Senate by Joseph R. McLaughlin. More than 10,000 persons\r\npetitioned for its passage, two similar bills having been introduced\r\nin the House. A hearing was granted by the Judiciary Committees, at\r\nwhich speeches were made by Senator and Mrs. McLaughlin, Clara A.\r\nAvery, Mrs. Andrew Howell, Dr. E. L. Shirley, the aged Lucinda\r\nHinsdale Stone, Melvin A. and Martha Snyder Root. Mrs. Root also\r\naddressed the Legislature in Representative Hall. The bill was amended\r\nto 17 years and passed in the Senate. The next day, after its friends\r\nhad dispersed, the vote was reconsidered and the bill amended to 16\r\nyears, passing both Houses in this form. The penalty is imprisonment\r\nfor life, or for any such period as the court shall direct, no minimum\r\npenalty being named.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: When at the close of the Civil War the States eliminated the\r\nword \"white\" from their constitutions, Michigan in 1867 amended her\r\nSchool Law to conform and also struck out the word \"male\" as a\r\nqualification for the suffrage, and gave tax-paying women a vote for\r\nschool trustees. In 1881 this law was further amended to include\r\nparents or guardians of children of school age. No woman can vote for\r\ncounty or State Superintendents, as these officers are provided for\r\nunder the constitution. Tax-paying women may also vote on bonds and\r\nappropriations for school purposes.\r\n\r\nThe year of 1888 was marked by a test of the constitutionality of this\r\nSchool Law, which involved the right of the Legislature to confer any\r\nform of suffrage whatever upon women. The test was made through the\r\nprosecution of the inspectors of election of the city of Flint by Mrs.\r\nEva R. Belles, whose vote was refused at a school election, she being\r\na qualified voter under the State law. Mrs. Belles won her case which\r\nwas then appealed to the Supreme Court. This affirmed the decision of\r\nthe lower court and sustained the law.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1893, the Legislature conferred Municipal Suffrage on women,\r\nbut in October the Supreme Court decided it unconstitutional on the\r\nground that \"the Legislature had no authority to create a new class of\r\nvoters.\" (See Legislative Action.) The Court held that it could,\r\nhowever, confer School Suffrage as \"the whole primary school system is\r\nconfided to the Legislature and its officers are not mentioned in the\r\nconstitution.\" By this decision women can have no other form of the\r\nfranchise except by constitutional amendment.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Hundreds of women are serving as officers and members\r\nof school boards throughout the State, as township school inspectors\r\nand as county school commissioners and examiners.\r\n\r\nA number are acting as deputy county clerks, and one as deputy clerk\r\nof the United States District Court. The latter frequently opens the\r\ncourt. Women serve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nFor thirty years women have filled the office of State Librarian, the\r\npresent incumbent being Mary C. Spencer.\r\n\r\nDr. Harriet M. C. Stone has been for several years assistant physician\r\nin the Michigan Asylum for the Insane at Kalamazoo.\r\n\r\nThe State Industrial School for Girls has two women on the Board of\r\nGuardians, one of whom, Allaseba M. Bliss, is the president and is\r\nserving her second term of four years, having been reappointed by Gov.\r\nHazen S. Pingree.[339] Since 1899 the law requires women physicians in\r\nasylums for the insane and other State institutions where women and\r\nchildren are cared for.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1898 Mrs. Merrie Hoover Abbott, law-partner in the\r\nfirm of Abbott & Abbott of West Branch, was nominated on the\r\nDemocratic ticket as prosecuting attorney of Ogemaw County. She was\r\nelected and entered upon her duties Jan. 1, 1899. _Quo warranto_\r\nproceedings were instituted by Attorney-General Horace M. Oren to test\r\nher right to the office, and October 17 the Supreme Court filed its\r\nopinion and entered judgment of ouster. In the meantime Mrs. Abbott\r\nhad discharged successfully the duties of the position. The opinion\r\nwas as follows: \"Where the constitution in creating a public office is\r\nsilent in regard to qualification to office, _electors_ only are\r\nqualified to fill the same, and since under the constitution women are\r\nnot electors, they are not eligible to hold such offices. The office\r\nof prosecuting attorney is a constitutional office which can only be\r\nheld by one possessing the qualification of an elector.\"\r\n\r\nFrom this opinion Justice Joseph B. Moore dissented, making an able\r\nargument. In closing he said:\r\n\r\n     The statutes of this State confer upon woman the right to\r\n     practice law. She may represent her client in the most important\r\n     litigation in all the courts, and no one can dispute her right.\r\n     She may defend a person charged with murder. Can she not\r\n     prosecute one charged with the larceny of a whip? To say she can\r\n     not seems illogical.... Individuals may employ her and the courts\r\n     must recognize her employment. If the people see fit, by electing\r\n     her to an office the duties of which pertain almost wholly to the\r\n     practice of the law, to employ her to represent them in their\r\n     litigation, why should not the courts recognize the\r\n     employment?... Where the constitution and the statutes are silent\r\n     as to the qualification for a given office, the people may elect\r\n     whom they will, if the person so elected is competent to\r\n     discharge the duties of the office.... None of the duties of\r\n     prosecuting attorney are of such a character as to preclude one\r\n     from their performance simply because of sex.\r\n\r\nCharles S. Abbott, Allen S. Morse and T. A. E. Weadock were the\r\nadvocates for Mrs. Abbott, and she also made a strong oral argument in\r\nher own behalf. Unfortunately the case was not one which permitted an\r\nappeal to the U. S. Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is forbidden by law to women.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All universities and colleges admit women. The University\r\nof Michigan (Ann Arbor), one of the largest in the country, was among\r\nthe first to open its doors to them. (1869.) Mrs. Lucinda Hinsdale\r\nStone was a strong factor in securing their admission. In having women\r\non its faculty, it is still in advance of most of those where\r\nco-education prevails.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 3,471 men and 12,093 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $44.48; of the women, $35.35.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMichigan may truly be called the founder of Woman's Clubs, as the\r\nfirst one for purely literary culture of which we have any record was\r\nformed in Kalamazoo, in 1852, by Mrs. Stone, to whom the women of the\r\nState are deeply indebted in many ways. At present (1902) there are\r\n133 in the General Federation with a membership of about 10,000, and a\r\nnumber are not federated. This State also leads all others in the\r\nnumber of women's club houses, ten of the leading clubs possessing\r\ntheir own. There are two of these in Grand Rapids--the St. Cecilia\r\n(musical) costing $53,000, and the Ladies' Literary costing $30,000,\r\nboth containing fine libraries, large audience rooms and every\r\nconvenience.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[330] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Mary L. Doe and\r\nMrs. May Stocking Knaggs, both of Bay City and former presidents of\r\nthe State Equal Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[331] This year strong societies were formed in Detroit, Bay City and\r\nBattle Creek. Michigan sent three representatives, Melvin A. and\r\nMartha Snyder Root and Emily B. Ketcham, to the New England Woman\r\nSuffrage Bazaar held at Boston in December. Mr. and Mrs. Root had\r\nspent much time and money canvassing the State to arouse interest and\r\nsecure contributions for this, and at its close New England gave to\r\nMichigan the total proceeds of her sales.\r\n\r\n[332] Melvin A. Root presented at this convention a compact digest of\r\nThe Legal Condition of Girls and Women in Michigan, which was\r\npublished the following year. It has been used widely, not only in\r\nthis but in other States, and has proved of inestimable service. A\r\nliberal gift of money came from the Hon. Delos A. Blodgett of Grand\r\nRapids, a constant friend.\r\n\r\n[333] See Chap. XVIII.\r\n\r\n[334] Other officers elected: Vice-president, Clara B. Arthur;\r\ncorresponding secretary, Alde L. T. Blake; recording secretary, Edith\r\nFrances Hall; treasurer, Martha Snyder Root; auditors, Margaret M.\r\nHuckins, Frances Ostrander; member national executive committee,\r\nLenore Starker Bliss.\r\n\r\n[335] Many petitions in favor of the bill had been sent unsolicited,\r\nthis not being a part of the plan of work. After the quick defeat in\r\nthe Senate it was found that the chairman of the committee to which\r\nthese had been referred had on file the names of 5,502 petitioners\r\n(2,469 men, 3,033 women) out of twenty-one senatorial districts. These\r\nwere in addition to many thousands sent in previous sessions, when\r\npetitioning had been a method of work.\r\n\r\n[336] Although the Detroit women obtained the change in their law just\r\nbefore the spring election, they made a house to house canvass to\r\nsecure registration and polled a vote of 2,700 women, electing\r\nSophronia O. C. Parsons to the school board.\r\n\r\n[337] It is interesting to note that in Wayne County women registered\r\nand attended primary meetings prior to this decision, but their votes\r\nwere held not to invalidate the nominations, although at least one of\r\nthe Judges of the Recorder's Court owed his election to being\r\nnominated through the votes of women.\r\n\r\n[338] In April, 1896, a large number of the philanthropic women of\r\nDetroit, including many suffragists, organized the Protective Agency\r\nfor Women and Children, opening an office in the Chamber of Commerce\r\nBuilding and employing an agent on salary. Since then it has done\r\nadmirable work and has obtained some good legislation.\r\n\r\n[339] Mrs. May Stocking Knaggs has been appointed (1901) a member of\r\nthe Board of Control of the State Industrial School for Girls, by Gov.\r\nAaron T. Bliss. [Eds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVII.\r\n\r\nMINNESOTA.[340]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first agitation of the question of woman suffrage in Minnesota,\r\nand the first petitions to the Legislature to grant it, began\r\nimmediately after the Civil War, through the efforts of Mrs. Sarah\r\nBurger Stearns and Mrs. Mary J. Colburn, and the first suffrage\r\nsocieties were formed by these ladies in 1869. The work has continued\r\nwith more or less regularity up to the present.\r\n\r\nFrom 1883 to 1890 the State Suffrage Association held its annual\r\nmeetings regularly in one or the other of the Twin Cities, Minneapolis\r\nand St. Paul. Susan B. Anthony, Lucy Stone, Henry B. Blackwell, Julia\r\nWard Howe, the Hon. William Dudley Foulke, Mary A. Livermore, the Rev.\r\nAda C. Bowles, Abigail Scott Duniway and other eminent advocates were\r\nsecured as speakers at different times. Dr. Martha G. Ripley succeeded\r\nMrs. Sarah Burger Stearns as president in 1883, and was re-elected\r\neach year until 1889. She was followed by Mrs. Ella M. S. Marble for\r\nthat year, and Dr. Mary Emery for 1890.\r\n\r\nThe association contributed toward sending Mrs. Julia B. Nelson to\r\nSouth Dakota to speak in the suffrage campaign of 1890. On November\r\n18, 19, the State convention was held in St. Paul, Mrs. Stearns\r\npresiding. Mrs. Nelson was elected president. Among the speakers were\r\nAttorney-General Moses E. Clapp, the Reverends Mr. Vail and Mr.\r\nMorgan, Mrs. A. T. Anderson, Mrs. Priscilla M. Niles, Mrs. Ella\r\nTremain Whitford and the Rev. Olympia Brown of Wisconsin.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1891 the convention met at Blue Earth City. This\r\nplace had not lost the savor of the salt which Elizabeth Cady Stanton,\r\nSusan B. Anthony and Phoebe W. Couzins had scattered in the vicinity\r\nthirteen years before, and the meetings were enthusiastic and\r\nwell-attended. The Rev. W. K. Weaver was the principal speaker.\r\n\r\nIt was largely as the superintendent of franchise of the State Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union, which was better organized, that Mrs.\r\nNelson, president of the suffrage association from 1890 to 1896, was\r\nable to secure thousands of signatures to the petitions for the\r\nfranchise which were sent to each Legislature during those years.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of 1892 took place at Hastings, September 6-8, and was\r\nwelcomed by the Rev. Lewis Llewellyn. Letters were read from many\r\nnoted people, and addresses given by the Rev. Mr. Morgan, Mrs. Stearns\r\nand several local speakers.\r\n\r\nThe convention met in Lake City, Aug. 24, 25, 1893, with the usual\r\nfine addresses, good music and representative audiences.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 Woman's Day was celebrated at the State Fair, its managers\r\npaying the speakers.\r\n\r\nIn the spring and autumn of 1895 Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe of Illinois and\r\nMrs. Laura M. Johns of Kansas, national organizers, lectured\r\nthroughout Minnesota and formed a number of clubs. They also attended\r\nthe State convention, which was held in the Capitol at St. Paul,\r\nSeptember 10, 11. Gov. D. M. Clough was among those who made\r\naddresses.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the president, Mrs. Nelson, gave one month to lecturing and\r\nvisiting societies.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1897, the acting president, Mrs. Concheta Ferris Lutz,\r\nmade an extended lecture tour. The annual meeting convened at\r\nMinneapolis in November, at the same time as a conference of the\r\nofficers of the National Association. All arrangements were made by\r\nDr. Cora Smith Eaton, Dr. Ripley and Mrs. Niles. The meetings in the\r\nFirst Baptist Church, one of the largest in the city, were very\r\nsuccessful. On Sunday evening the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nvice-president-at-large of the National Association, preached in the\r\nUniversalist Church, and Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the\r\nnational organization committee, lectured in the Wesley M. E. Church,\r\nboth to crowded houses. The next evening, when Miss Anthony, national\r\npresident, and the latter spoke, every foot of standing ground was\r\noccupied, and on Tuesday, when Miss Shaw gave her lecture on The Fate\r\nof Republics, the church was equally well-filled.\r\n\r\nMrs. Nelson, after seven years' service, relinquished the office of\r\npresident and Dr. Eaton was elected. Professional duties soon made it\r\nnecessary for her to resign and her place was filled by Mrs. Lutz.\r\nPolitical equality clubs were formed in six different wards of\r\nMinneapolis by Dr. Eaton.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1898 was called October 4, 5, at Minneapolis, with\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt in attendance. The meetings were held in the G. A.\r\nR. Hall, the Masonic Temple and the Lyceum Theater. Mrs. Martha J.\r\nThompson was elected president and Dr. Ethel E. Hurd corresponding\r\nsecretary.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the convention met in the court-house of Albert Lea, October\r\n9, 10. On the first evening Mrs. Chapman Catt was the speaker, her\r\ntheme being A True Democracy. The Rev. Ida C. Hultin of Illinois\r\nlectured on The Crowning Race. Miss Laura A. Gregg and Miss Helen L.\r\nKimber, both of Kansas, national organizers, gave reports of county\r\nconventions conducted by them throughout Minnesota, with the\r\nassistance of Mrs. Evelyn H. Belden, president of the Iowa Equal\r\nSuffrage Association. The records showed ninety-eight suffrage\r\nmeetings altogether to have been held during the year.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the convention took place at Stillwater, October 11, 12. The\r\nofficers elected were: President, Mrs. Maude C. Stockwell;\r\nvice-president, Mrs. Jennie E. Brown; corresponding secretary, Miss\r\nDelia O'Malley; recording secretary, Mrs. Maria B. Bryant; treasurer,\r\nDr. Margaret Koch; auditors, Sanford Niles and Mrs. Estelle Way;\r\nchairman executive committee, Mrs. Martha J. Thompson.[341]\r\n\r\nJudge J. B. and Mrs. Sarah Burger Stearns, C. W. and Mrs. Martha A.\r\nDorsett have been among the oldest and most valued suffrage workers\r\nin the State. Miss Martha Scott Anderson, on the staff of the\r\nMinneapolis _Journal_, gives efficient help to the cause. Three\r\npresidents of the State W. C. T. U., Mesdames Harriet A. Hobart,\r\nSusanna M. D. Fry and Bessie Laythe Scoville have been noted as\r\nadvocates of equal rights.[342]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In February, 1891, at the request of Mrs.\r\nJulia B. Nelson, president, and Mrs. A. T. Anderson, chairman of the\r\nexecutive committee of the State association, S. A. Stockwell\r\nintroduced in the House a bill conferring Municipal Suffrage upon\r\nwomen. Mrs. Nelson spent several weeks at the capital looking after\r\nthe petitions which came from all parts of the State, interviewing\r\nmembers of the Legislature, distributing literature and trying to get\r\nthe bill out of the hands of the Committee on Elections, to which it\r\nhad been referred. After repeated postponements a hearing finally was\r\ngranted, at which she made a strong plea and showed the good results\r\nof woman suffrage in Kansas and Wyoming. The bill was indefinitely\r\npostponed in Committee of the Whole, by a vote of 52 yeas, 40 nays.\r\n\r\nAmong the leaflets placed on the desk of each member was one\r\nespecially prepared by Mrs. Nelson, entitled Points on Municipal\r\nSuffrage. One of its twelve points was this: \"If the Legislature has\r\nthe power to restrict suffrage it certainly has the right to extend\r\nit. The Legislature of Minnesota restricted the suffrage which had\r\nbeen given to women by a constitutional amendment, when it granted to\r\nthe city of St. Paul a charter taking the election of members of the\r\nschool board entirely out of the hands of women by giving their\r\nappointment to the mayor, an officer elected by the votes of men\r\nonly.\"[343]\r\n\r\nEarly in the session of 1893 Mrs. Nelson had a conference with\r\nIgnatius Donnelly, leader of the Populists, who was then in the\r\nSenate. He was willing to introduce a suffrage bill, but as the\r\nRepublicans were in the majority it was thought best to have this done\r\nby John Day Smith, the leader of that party in the Senate. Mr. Smith\r\nconsented, with the understanding that Mr. Donnelly should help by\r\nchampioning the bill. \"Municipal Suffrage for women with educational\r\nqualifications,\" was all this bill asked for. Mrs. Nelson, Mrs. Anna\r\nB. Turley and Senator Donnelly made addresses before the Judiciary\r\nCommittee at a hearing in the Senate Chamber, with an interested\r\naudience present. Mrs. Nelson also gave an evening lecture here on The\r\nRoad to Freedom.\r\n\r\nIn place of this bill one to submit an amendment to the voters was\r\nsubstituted. The suffragists were averse to this, but accepted it with\r\nthe best grace possible, and enthusiastically worked for the new bill\r\nto amend the State constitution by striking the word \"male\" from the\r\narticle restricting the suffrage. Senators Smith, Donnelly and Edwin\r\nE. Lommen spoke for the bill, and it passed the Senate by 31 yeas, 19\r\nnays.\r\n\r\nIn the House it was persistently delayed by the chairman of the\r\nJudiciary Committee, George H. Fletcher, and the friends could not get\r\nit upon the calendar in time to be reached unless it should be made a\r\nspecial order. Edward T. Young endeavored to have this done, but as\r\nthere were several hundred other bills to be considered and less than\r\nthree days of the session left, his motion was lost. On the last\r\nnight, Mr. Young and H. P. Bjorge made an effort to have the rules\r\nsuspended and the bill put upon its final passage. The vote on this\r\nmotion was 54 yeas, 44 nays, but as a two-thirds vote is necessary it\r\nwas lost. Speaker W. E. Lee voted with the affirmative.[344]\r\n\r\nThree Suffrage Bills were introduced into the Legislature of 1895, two\r\nin the House and one in the Senate. The first, for an amendment to the\r\nState constitution, was offered by O. L. Brevig and was indefinitely\r\npostponed. S. T. Littleton presented the second, which was to give\r\nwomen a vote upon all questions pertaining to the liquor traffic. This\r\nfound favor in the eyes of the W. C. T. U., as did also the County\r\nOption Bill of J. F. Jacobson, but both were unsuccessful. George T.\r\nBarr introduced a Municipal Suffrage Bill into the Senate, but too\r\nlate for it to be acted upon.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Ignatius Donnelly secured the introduction of a bill to\r\nenfranchise taxpaying women. A hearing was given by the Judiciary\r\nCommittee, at which Mrs. Nelson argued that in simple justice women\r\nwho pay taxes should have a voice in their expenditure or be exempted\r\nfrom taxation, but the bill was not reported.\r\n\r\nThis year the State Federation of Clubs secured a resolution to submit\r\nan amendment to the electorate in 1898, giving women the privilege of\r\nvoting for and serving on Library Boards.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the Local Council of Women of Minneapolis obtained the\r\nTraveling Library Bill.\r\n\r\nDuring this year no petitioning or legislative work was done by the\r\nsuffragists. The previous legislature had submitted an amendment,\r\nwhich carried, providing that all amendments hereafter must receive a\r\nmajority of the largest number of votes cast at an election, in order\r\nto be adopted. The precedent had been established in 1875 of requiring\r\na vote of the electors on the granting of School Suffrage to women,\r\nand in 1898, of Library Suffrage, and it was held that _the same would\r\nhave to be done_ on granting Municipal or any other form of the\r\nfranchise.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy were abolished March 9, 1875. If either husband or\r\nwife die without a will, the survivor, if there is issue living, is\r\nentitled to the homestead for life and one-third of the rest of the\r\nreal estate in fee-simple, or by such inferior tenure as the deceased\r\nwas possessed of, but subject to its just proportion of the debts. If\r\nthere are no descendants, the entire real estate goes absolutely to\r\nthe survivor. The personal property follows the same rules. If either\r\nhusband or wife has wilfully and without just cause deserted and lived\r\nseparately from the other for the entire year immediately prior to his\r\nor her decease, such survivor shall not be entitled to any estate\r\nwhatever in any of the lands of the deceased.\r\n\r\nThe estate of a child who dies without a will and leaves neither wife\r\nnor children, goes to the father; if he is dead, to the mother.\r\n\r\nThe wife can not convey or encumber her separate real estate without\r\nthe joinder of her husband. The husband can sell or mortgage all his\r\nreal estate without her joinder, but subject to her dower. They are\r\nboth free agents as to personal property.\r\n\r\nIf divorce is obtained for the adultery of the wife, her own real\r\nestate may be withheld from her, but not so in case of the husband.\r\n\r\nIn case of divorce, the court decides which parent is more fit for the\r\nguardianship of children under fourteen years of age; over fourteen,\r\nthe child decides. Except when children are given to the mother by\r\ndecree of court, the father is the legal guardian of their persons and\r\nproperty. He may appoint by will a guardian for a child, born or\r\nunborn, to the exclusion of the mother.\r\n\r\nThe husband must support the family according to his means. Failure to\r\ndo so used to be considered a misdemeanor but it has recently been\r\nmade a felony punishable by imprisonment in the penitentiary from one\r\nto three years unless he give bond for their maintenance. This is\r\nlikely to be of little effect, however, because of the law of\r\n\"privileged communications\" which makes it impossible for the wife to\r\ntestify against the husband.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 16\r\nyears, after thousands of women had petitioned to have it raised to\r\n18. If the child is under 10 years the penalty is imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary for life; between 10 and 14 not less than seven nor more\r\nthan thirty years; between 14 and 16 not less than one nor more than\r\nseven years, or it may be imprisonment in the county jail not less\r\nthan three months nor more than one year.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: An amendment to the constitution was adopted in 1875, giving\r\nwomen a vote on all questions pertaining to the public schools. It\r\nbeing held afterward that this did not enable them to vote for county\r\nsuperintendents, an act for this purpose was passed by the Legislature\r\nin 1885. (!) The constitution was further amended by popular vote in\r\n1898, granting to women the franchise for members of Library Boards,\r\nand making them eligible to hold any office pertaining to the\r\nmanagement of libraries. On as harmless an amendment as this 43,600\r\nmen voted in the negative, but 71,704 voted in the affirmative; and it\r\nwas adopted.\r\n\r\nThis was probably the last election at which any amendment whatever\r\ncould have been carried; for, among four submitted in the same year,\r\nwas one providing that thereafter no amendment could be adopted by\r\nmerely a majority of those voting upon it, but that it must have a\r\nmajority of the largest number of votes cast at that election.[345]\r\nNone ever has been submitted which aroused sufficient interest to\r\nreceive as large a vote of both affirmative and negative combined as\r\nwas cast for the highest officer. Therefore in Minnesota it is\r\nimpossible for women to obtain any further extension of the franchise.\r\nTheir only hope for the full suffrage lies in the submission of an\r\namendment to the Federal Constitution by Congress to the Legislatures\r\nof the various States.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: An act of 1887 declares that a woman shall retain the\r\nsame legal existence and legal personality after marriage as before,\r\nand shall receive the same protection of all her rights as a woman\r\nwhich her husband does as a man; and for any injury sustained to her\r\nreputation, person or property, she shall have the same right to\r\nappeal, in her own name alone, to the courts for redress; but this act\r\nshall not confer upon the wife the right to vote or hold office,\r\nexcept as is otherwise provided by law. By a constitutional amendment\r\nadopted in 1875 women were made eligible to all offices pertaining to\r\nthe public schools and to public libraries. They have served as State\r\nlibrarians.\r\n\r\nMiss Jennie C. Crays was president of the Minneapolis school board for\r\ntwo years. There are forty-three women county superintendents at the\r\npresent time, each having from 100 to 130 districts to visit. Women\r\nhave served as clerks and treasurers of school districts.\r\n\r\nA law of 1889 gave to women as well as men the powers of constables,\r\nsheriffs or police officers, as agents of the Society for the\r\nPrevention of Cruelty to Animals.\r\n\r\nA law of 1891 enabled women to be appointed deputies in county\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nDr. Adele S. Hutchison is a member of the State Medical Board which\r\nexamines physicians for license to practice. She was appointed by Gov.\r\nJohn Lind and is the first woman to hold such a position. Women can\r\nnot sit on any other State boards.\r\n\r\nThere is no law requiring police matrons but they are employed in\r\nMinneapolis and St. Paul by the city charters.\r\n\r\nThe State hospitals for the insane are required by law to have women\r\nphysicians. The steward's clerk in the State Institute for Defectives\r\nis a woman. The State Public School for Dependent and Neglected\r\nChildren has a matron, a woman agent and a woman clerk. The State\r\nTraining School, once called the Reform School, has women for agent\r\nand secretary.\r\n\r\nThe State Prison has a matron for the eight women prisoners. There are\r\nabout 500 men prisoners (1900).\r\n\r\nThe Bethany Home at Minneapolis was established by women in 1875, and\r\nis entirely officered by them. In 1900 it cared for 126 mothers and\r\n226 infants, and had a kindergarten and a training school for nurses.\r\nThe city hospitals send all their charity obstetrical cases here, and\r\nabout half of its support comes from the city.\r\n\r\nThe Northwestern Hospital for Women and Children was founded by women\r\nin 1882, and until 1899 was entirely officered and managed by them.\r\n\r\nThe Maternity Hospital for unfortunate women was founded by Dr. Martha\r\nG. Ripley in 1888. In 1899 it cared for 103 mothers and 99 infants.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is forbidden to women by law.\r\nWomen were admitted to the bar in 1877 by act of the Legislature.\r\nThere are sixty-eight women doctors registered as in actual practice\r\nin the State. In Minneapolis there is an active Medical Women's Club\r\nof physicians of both schools. Women ministers are filling pulpits of\r\nCongregational, Universalist, Christian and Wesleyan Methodist\r\nchurches, and the superintendent of the State Epworth League is a\r\nwoman.\r\n\r\nWomen are especially conspicuous in farming, which is one of the\r\ngreatest industries of the State.[346]\r\n\r\nA number of women own and publish papers, and each of the large\r\nmetropolitan dailies has one or more women on its staff.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Women have been admitted to all departments of the State\r\nUniversity since its foundation, and there are women professors and\r\nassistants in practically every department, including that of\r\nPolitical Science and the College of Engineering and Mechanic Arts. Of\r\nthe four officers of the Department of Drawing and Industrial Art,\r\nthree are women. The College of Medicine and Surgery also has women\r\nprofessors in every department, and women are on the faculty of the\r\nCollege of Dentistry.\r\n\r\nThe State School of Agriculture was established in the fall of 1888.\r\nIn October, 1897, women were admitted to the regular course of study.\r\nIn the Academic Department their class work is with the men, but\r\ninstead of the especial branches of carpentry, blacksmithing and field\r\nwork, they have sewing, cooking and laundering. They also have a\r\ndepartment of home management, home economy, social culture, household\r\nart and domestic hygiene, Mrs. Virginia C. Meredith, preceptor.\r\n\r\nAll the other educational institutions are open to women, and the\r\nfaculties of the Normal Schools are largely composed of women.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 2,306 men and 9,811 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $46; of the women, $35.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe State Federation of Women's Clubs, Mrs. Lydia P. Williams,\r\npresident, is in effect a suffrage kindergarten, many of its members\r\nworking on committees of education, reciprocity, town and village\r\nimprovements, household economics, legislation, etc.\r\n\r\nIn Minneapolis a stock company, capitalized at $80,000, is being\r\nformed to erect a club house for the women's societies.\r\n\r\nThe Local Council of Women of Minneapolis, organized 1892, is one of\r\nthe strongest associations of the kind in the United States. During\r\nthe past seven years it has been composed of nearly one hundred\r\ndifferent organizations in the city, and now comprises twelve\r\ndepartments: reform and philanthropy, church, temperance, art, music,\r\nliterature, patriotism, history, education, philosophy, social and\r\ncivic. Honorary president, Mrs. T. B. Walker, acting president Mrs. A.\r\nE. Higbee, and corresponding secretary, Mrs. J. E. Woodford, are\r\nlargely responsible for the success of the Council. (1900).\r\n\r\nThe School and Library Association was formed in 1899 at a meeting\r\ncalled by representatives of the Political Equality, the Business\r\nWomen's, the Medical Women's and the Teachers' Clubs of Minneapolis.\r\nEleven hundred signatures are required for the nomination of a member\r\nof the school board, but the women secured over 5,000 names on each\r\npetition for their candidates for school and library trustees, the\r\nlargest one having 5,470. The association sent out dodgers with\r\npictures and brief write-ups of the candidates, and also leaflets\r\nexplaining to the women how to register and vote. Mrs. A. T. Anderson\r\nhas been at the head of this work.\r\n\r\nWomen attend the conventions of the Prohibition and the People's\r\nparties as delegates, and are welcome speakers. Miss Eva McDonald\r\n(Valesh) was secretary of the Populist Executive Committee. Both\r\nProhibitionists and Populists have passed woman suffrage resolutions\r\nin their State conventions. The Federation of Labor and the Grange\r\nhave done the same.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[340] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Julia B. Nelson\r\nof Red Wing, who for twenty years has been the rock on which the\r\neffort for woman suffrage has been founded in this State. She\r\nacknowledges much assistance from Drs. Cora Smith Eaton and Ethel E.\r\nHurd, both of Minneapolis.\r\n\r\n[341] Among the officers of the State association at different times\r\nhave been Mesdames Harriet Armstrong, Sarah C. Brooks, S. P.

At the request of a few women the Moccasin Blossom was made\r\nthe State Flower by an act of the same Legislature, which was passed\r\nwith great celerity.\r\n\r\n[345] The vote on this was 69,760 for, and 32,881 against, a total of\r\n102,641; yet the whole number of votes cast in that election of 1898\r\nwas 251,250. The amendment itself could not have been adopted if its\r\nown provisions had been required!\r\n\r\n[346] The woman farmer turns up the soil with a gang-plow and rakes\r\nthe hay, but not in the primitive fashion of Maud Muller. She is\r\nfrequently seen \"comin' through the rye,\" the wheat, the barley or the\r\noats, enthroned on a twine-binder. The writer has this day seen a\r\nwoman seated on a four-horse plow as contentedly as her city cousin\r\nmight be in an automobile. Among the many plow-girls of Nobles County\r\nis Coris Young, a genuine American of Vermont ancestry, who has plowed\r\n120 acres this season, making a record of eighty acres in thirteen\r\ndays with five horses abreast.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLVIII.\r\n\r\nMISSISSIPPI.[347]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1884 the idea of an organization devoted exclusively to the\r\nadvancement of the \"woman's cause\" in Mississippi had not assumed\r\ntangible form, granting that even the audacious conception had found\r\nlodgment in the brain of any person. The nearest approach seems to\r\nhave been a Woman's Press Club, which sprung into being about this\r\ntime, but was short-lived, due to the fact, it is charged, that a\r\nlittle leaven of \"woman's rights\" having crept in, \"the whole lump\"\r\nwas threatened.\r\n\r\nTo the Women's Christian Temperance Union the State is largely\r\nindebted for the existence of its Woman Suffrage Association, which\r\nwas organized in Meridian, May 5, 1897, immediately upon the\r\nadjournment of a convention of the State W. C. T. U. The seed sown in\r\n1895 by Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the national\r\norganization committee, and Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates of Maine, and\r\nin 1897 by Miss Ella Harrison of Missouri and Mrs. Mary C. C. Bradford\r\nof Colorado, now produced a harvest of clubs, and resulted in a roster\r\nof friends in twenty-four towns. Mrs. Nellie M. Somerville was elected\r\npresident of the association, and Mrs. Lily Wilkinson Thompson\r\ncorresponding secretary.\r\n\r\nThe first annual convention was held in Greenville, March 29, 30,\r\n1898. The second and third took place at Clarksdale, the former April\r\n5, 6, 1899, and the latter in May, 1900.[348] At this meeting the\r\nreport of the superintendent of press, Mrs. Butt, showed that\r\ntwenty-two newspapers had opened their columns to suffrage articles.\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt and Miss Mary G. Hay, national organizer, were\r\npresent, and the former gave an address to a large and sympathetic\r\nassemblage. She was likewise greeted with good audiences at seven\r\nother towns, among them Jackson, the capital, where she spoke in the\r\nHouse of Representatives. A work conference was held at Flora in\r\nSeptember of this year.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: The W. S. A. has not attempted any\r\nlegislative work, other than the one effort made in 1900 to secure a\r\nbill providing for a woman physician at the State Hospital for the\r\nInsane. This was introduced and championed in the Senate by R. B.\r\nCampbell (to whom the association is also indebted for the compilation\r\nof a valuable pamphlet on The Legal Status of Mississippi Women). It\r\npassed that body almost unanimously, but did not reach the House.\r\n\r\nThe measure which provided for the State Industrial Institute and\r\nCollege for Women (white) was the conception of Mrs. Annie Coleman\r\nPeyton, the bill itself being framed by her brother, Judge S. R.\r\nColeman, a legislator and a leading attorney. It was sent to the\r\nLegislature as early as 1877, but was not at that time even\r\nconsidered. Mrs. Peyton continued her agitation in its behalf and\r\nsucceeded in having it introduced in 1880 and in 1882, but it was\r\ntwice defeated. By the time the Legislature convened in 1884, however,\r\nits author had enlisted the sympathy of so many of the prominent men\r\nand women of the State that the bill was passed at that session. Wiley\r\nP. Nash and Mac C. Martin were its earnest champions on the floor of\r\nthe House; while Col. J. L. Power, the present Secretary of State,\r\nMajor Jonas, of the Aberdeen _Examiner_, and Mrs. Olive A. Hastings\r\nwere among the ablest coadjutors of Mrs. Peyton.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the suffrage association petitioned Gov. A. H. Longino to\r\nappoint one woman on the board of this institution, which is wholly\r\nfor women, but he refused on the ground that it would be\r\nunconstitutional.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the Legislature abrogated the Common Law as to its provisions\r\nfor wives, being a pioneer among the Southern States to take such\r\naction. It declared:\r\n\r\n     The Legislature shall never create any distinction between the\r\n     rights of men and women to acquire, own, enjoy and dispose of\r\n     property of all kinds, or their power to contract in reference\r\n     thereto. Married women are hereby emancipated from all\r\n     disabilities on account of coverture. But this shall not prevent\r\n     the Legislature from regulating contracts between husband and\r\n     wife; nor shall the Legislature be prevented from regulating the\r\n     sale of homesteads.\r\n\r\nThe property belonging to the wife at the time of marriage no longer\r\npasses to her husband, although it is still largely under his control.\r\nHe becomes her debtor and is accountable to her for her separate\r\nproperty; and she must have him account to her annually for the income\r\nand profits which he may receive from it, otherwise she will be\r\nbarred. If the wife permit the husband to employ the income or profits\r\nof her estate in the maintenance of the family, he will not be liable\r\nto her therefor.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy are abolished. If either husband or wife die without\r\na will, leaving no children nor descendants of any, the entire estate,\r\nreal and personal, goes to the survivor. But if there are one or more\r\nchildren or descendants by this or by a former marriage, the surviving\r\nwife or husband has a child's share of both real and personal estate.\r\n\r\nEach has equal rights in making a will, although if the provisions are\r\nnot satisfactory to the survivor he or she can take under the law, but\r\nthis can not be done if separate property is owned equal to what would\r\nbe the inheritable portion of the estate.\r\n\r\nIf the residence is upon the property of the husband, that is the\r\nhomestead and exempt from his debts and he is the head of the family.\r\nIf it is upon the property of the wife, that is the homestead and\r\nexempt from her debts, and she is the head of the family. In neither\r\ncase can it be mortgaged or sold unless both join, but the one owning\r\nit may dispose of it by will.\r\n\r\nA married woman may qualify as executor or administrator of the estate\r\nof a deceased person, and as guardian of the estate of a minor or\r\nperson of unsound mind.\r\n\r\nShe may contract, sue and be sued and carry on business in her own\r\nname as if unmarried and her earnings belong to her.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the minor children and by will may\r\nappoint a guardian of their property, but he can not deprive the\r\nmother of the custody of their persons.\r\n\r\nThe husband is required by law to support and maintain his family out\r\nof his estate and by his services unless the wife sees fit to allow\r\nhim to use her property for this purpose.\r\n\r\nAlimony is allowed to the wife whether the suit for divorce is brought\r\nby her or against her, or whether she asks simply for separation; but,\r\neven if divorced, unchastity on her part will bar her right to further\r\nalimony.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls remains at 10 years. The penalty is\r\ndeath or imprisonment in the penitentiary for life.\r\n\r\nThe Constitutional Convention of 1890 provided that no Legislature\r\nshould repeal or impair the above property rights of married women.\r\n\r\nThis convention was called primarily to change the constitution with\r\nreference to the elimination of the negro vote. It was composed of\r\nrepresentative men thoroughly alive to what they construed as the best\r\ninterests of the State. As one way of circumventing the threatened\r\nsupremacy of this vote, the enfranchisement of women was variously\r\nconsidered. The first amendment for this purpose was submitted by\r\nJudge John W. Fewell:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That it is a condition necessary to the solution of\r\n     the franchise problem, that the right to vote shall be secured by\r\n     proper constitutional enactment to every woman who shall have\r\n     resided in this State six months, and who shall be 21 years of\r\n     age or upward, and who shall own, or whose husband, if she have a\r\n     husband, shall own real estate situate in this State of the clear\r\n     value of $300 over and above all incumbrances.\r\n\r\n     The vote of any woman voting in any election shall be cast by\r\n     some male elector, who shall be thereunto authorized in writing\r\n     by such woman so entitled to vote; such constitutional amendment\r\n     not to be so framed as to grant to women the right to hold\r\n     office.\r\n\r\nThis was referred to the Committee on Franchise, composed of\r\nthirty-five members, but was defeated. The idea was that a great many\r\nwhite women owned property, while very few negro women did, hence the\r\nwoman vote would furnish a reserve fund which could be called out in\r\nan emergency, the author of the measure himself being \"not an advocate\r\nof female suffrage generally,\" according to his remarks before the\r\nconvention. Many, perhaps a majority, at one time favored the scheme,\r\nit was said, though comparatively few of the committee recognized the\r\njustice of woman's enfranchisement _per se_.\r\n\r\nJ. W. Odom offered, among other measures from the \"California\r\nAlliance\" of DeSoto County, a proposition that the right of suffrage\r\nbe conferred upon women on \"certain conditions\" not specified. John P.\r\nRobinson and D. J. Johnson also submitted sections providing for\r\n\"female suffrage under certain conditions.\" Jordan L. Morris offered\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n     The Legislature shall have power to confer the elective franchise\r\n     on all women who are citizens of the State and of the United\r\n     States, 21 years of age and upwards, who own, in their own right,\r\n     over and above all incumbrances, property listed for taxation of\r\n     the value of $500 or upwards, or who, being widows, own jointly\r\n     with their own or their husband's children, property of said\r\n     value listed for taxation; or who are capable of teaching a\r\n     first-grade public school in this State, as prescribed by law,\r\n     and who never have been convicted, and shall not thereafter be\r\n     convicted of any crime or misdemeanor and not pardoned therefor,\r\n     to such extent and under such restrictions and limitations as it\r\n     may deem proper to prescribe.\r\n\r\nAll of these noble efforts resulted in no action whatever to\r\nenfranchise women.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Since 1880 a woman as a freeholder, or leaseholder, may vote\r\nat a county election, or sign a petition for such an election to be\r\nheld, to decide as to the adoption or non-adoption of a law permitting\r\nstock to run at large. She may also, if a widow and, as such, the head\r\nof the family, manifest by ballot her consent or dissent to leasing\r\ncertain portions of land in the township, known as the \"sixteenth\r\nsections,\" which are set apart for school purposes. As a patron of a\r\nschool, which presupposes her widowhood, she may vote at an election\r\nof school trustees, other than in a \"separate school district,\" which\r\npractically limits this privilege to women in the country.[349]\r\n\r\nAs a taxpayer a woman can petition against the issuance of bonds by\r\nthe municipality in which she resides (except where the proposed\r\nissuance is governed and regulated by a charter adopted previous to\r\nthe code of 1892), but if a special election is ordered she can not\r\nvote for or against issuing the bonds.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature in dealing with the liquor traffic may make the grant\r\nof license depend upon a petition therefor signed by men and women, or\r\nby women only, or upon any other condition that it may prescribe; and\r\nit seems to be equally true that the Legislature may grant to women\r\nthe right to vote at elections held to determine whether or not local\r\noption laws shall be put in force, but it never has done so.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: The constitution provides that \"all qualified\r\nelectors, and no others, shall be eligible to office.\"\r\n\r\nIn the constitutional convention of 1890 Jordan L. Morris offered a\r\nresolution \"that the Legislature may make women, with such\r\nqualifications as may be prescribed, competent to hold the office of\r\ncounty superintendent of schools.\" This amendment was tabled. J. W.\r\nCutrer submitted a section \"making eligible to all offices connected\r\nwith the public schools, except that of State Superintendent of Public\r\nEducation, all women of good moral character, twenty-five years or\r\nupwards of age,\" which was not favorably reported. A clause was\r\nintroduced by W. B. Eskridge making \"any white woman twenty-one years\r\nold, who has been a _bona fide_ citizen of the State two years before\r\nher election, and who shall be of good moral character,\" eligible to\r\nthe office of chancery or circuit clerk; and another, that \"any white\r\nwoman, etc., shall be qualified to hold the office of keeper of the\r\nCapitol and State librarian.\"\r\n\r\nThe last office, as recommended in a separate measure by George G.\r\nDillard, which was adopted, is the only one to which women are\r\nspecifically eligible, but none has held it.\r\n\r\nIn some counties the constitution has been liberally interpreted to\r\nmake women eligible to serve on school boards; this, however, is\r\nregulated usually by the judgment of the county superintendent. Women\r\nare elected to such positions occasionally in the smaller towns.\r\n\r\nThe code of 1892 created the text-book committee, whose duty is to\r\nadopt a uniform series of books for use in the public schools of a\r\ncounty. An official record is kept of its specific functions, all\r\nmembers being required to \"take the oath of office,\" etc., and thus\r\nconstituted public officers according to a recent ruling of the\r\nAttorney-General. The majority of these committees are women\r\nteachers, appointed by the county superintendents, but no provision\r\nhas been made for their remuneration.\r\n\r\nWomen can not serve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen. They are licensed to practice medicine, dentistry and\r\npharmaceutics. It is believed that the statute would be construed to\r\nenable them to practice law, but the test has not been made. Several\r\nwomen own and manage newspapers.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The State University has been open to women for twenty\r\nyears, and annually graduates a number. Millsaps College, a leading\r\ninstitution for men, has recently admitted a few women to its B. A.\r\ncourse, and this doubtless will become a fixed policy. The\r\nAgricultural and Mechanical College and the State Normal School (both\r\ncolored) are co-educational. Several women hold college\r\nprofessorships.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 3,645 men and 4,254 women teachers:\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $32.18; of the women, $26.69.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe State Federation of Women's Clubs was organized in 1897 and has a\r\nmembership of fifteen societies.\r\n\r\nWomen have never actively participated in public campaigns except in\r\nlocal politics where the liquor question has been the paramount issue.\r\nMiss Belle Kearney is a temperance lecturer of national reputation,\r\nand a pronounced advocate of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[347] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Hala Hammond\r\nButt of Clarksdale, president of the State Woman Suffrage Association\r\nand editor of the _Challenge_, a county paper.\r\n\r\n[348] Officers elected: President, Mrs. Hala Hammond Butt;\r\nvice-president, Mrs. Fannie Clark; corresponding secretary, Mrs.\r\nHarriet B. Kells; recording secretary, Mrs. Rebecca Roby; treasurer,\r\nMiss Mabel Pugh. Other officers have been Miss Belle Kearney and\r\nMesdames Nellie Nugent, Charlotte L. Pitman and Pauline Alston Clark.\r\n\r\n[349] Any municipality of 300 or more inhabitants may be declared a\r\n\"separate school district\" by an ordinance of the mayor or board of\r\naldermen if it maintain a free public school at least seven months in\r\neach year. Four months is the ordinary public term, the additional\r\nthree months' school being supported by special taxation. Thus as soon\r\nas a woman has to pay a special tax she is deprived of a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER XLIX.\r\n\r\nMISSOURI.[350]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe movement toward equal suffrage in Missouri must always recognize\r\nas its founder Mrs. Virginia L. Minor. She was a thorough believer in\r\nthe right of woman to the franchise, and at the November election of\r\n1872 offered her own vote under the provisions of the Fourteenth\r\nAmendment to the Federal Constitution. It was refused; she brought\r\nsuit against the inspectors and carried her case to the Supreme Court\r\nof the United States, where it was argued with great ability by her\r\nhusband, Francis Minor, but an adverse decision was rendered.[351]\r\n\r\nThe first suffrage association in the State was organized at St. Louis\r\nin the winter of 1867. Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony lectured under its auspices at Library Hall in the autumn of\r\nthat year, and a reception was given them in the parlors of the\r\nSouthern Hotel. For many years meetings were held with more or less\r\nregularity, Mrs. Minor was continued as president and some legislative\r\nwork was attempted.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 8, 9, 1892, an interstate woman suffrage convention was held\r\nin Kansas City. Mrs. Laura M. Johns, president of the Kansas\r\nassociation, in the chair. Mrs. Minor, Mrs. Beverly Allen and Mrs.\r\nRebecca N. Hazard were made honorary presidents and Mrs. Virginia\r\nHedges was elected president. Addresses were given by Mrs. Clara C.\r\nHoffman, the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, Mrs. Mary Seymour Howell of New\r\nYork and Miss Florence Balgarnie of England. A club was formed in\r\nKansas City with Mrs. Sarah Chandler Coates as president.\r\n\r\nDuring the next few years the State association co-operated with other\r\nsocieties in public and legislative work. Mrs. Minor passed away in\r\n1894, an irreparable loss to the cause of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1895, the Mississippi Valley Congress was called at St. Louis\r\nunder the auspices of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, and\r\nvarious other organizations participated. Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw,\r\npresident and vice-president-at-large of the National Association,\r\nstopped on their way to California and made addresses. Just before\r\nMiss Anthony began her address, seventy-five children, some of them\r\ncolored, passed before her and each laid a rose in her lap, in honor\r\nof her seventy-five years.\r\n\r\nThe preceding spring the National Association had sent Mrs. Anna R.\r\nSimmons of South Dakota into Missouri to lecture for two months and\r\nreunite the scattered forces. A State suffrage convention followed the\r\ncongress and Mrs. Addie M. Johnson was elected president. At its close\r\na banquet with 200 covers was given in the Mercantile Club Room, with\r\nMiss Anthony as the guest of honor. A local society, of nearly one\r\nhundred members, was formed in St. Louis. During October Mrs. Simmons\r\nagain made a tour of the State at the expense of the National\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nOn June 15, 16, 1896, the annual convention took place in St. Louis\r\nwith delegates present from seventeen clubs. Addresses were made by\r\nMrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the national organization\r\ncommittee, Henry B. Blackwell, editor of the _Woman's Journal_, Mrs.\r\nMary C. C. Bradford of Colorado and others who were in the city trying\r\nto obtain some recognition for women from the National Republican\r\nConvention. Miss Ella Harrison was made president. Public meetings\r\nwere called for November 12, 13, in Kansas City, as it was then\r\npossible to have the presence of Miss Anthony, Miss Shaw and Mrs.\r\nChapman Catt on their return from the suffrage amendment campaign in\r\nCalifornia.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1897, Mrs. Bradford spent three weeks lecturing in the\r\nState, and the president devoted a month to this purpose during the\r\nautumn. The annual meeting convened in Bethany, December 7-9, Mrs.\r\nJohns and Mrs. Hoffman being the principal speakers.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1898 was held at St. Joseph, October 17-19, with\r\nMiss Anthony and Mrs. Chapman Catt in attendance, and the board of\r\nofficers was re-elected.\r\n\r\nIn the fall of 1899 a series of conferences, planned by the national\r\norganization committee, was held in twenty counties, being managed by\r\nMrs. Johnson and Miss Ella Moffatt, and addressed by Miss Lena Morrow\r\nof Illinois and Mrs. Mary Waldo Calkins. These ended with a State\r\nconvention at Chillicothe in October.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1900 was held in St. Joseph during October, and\r\nMrs. Johnson was elected president.[352]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In 1887, through the efforts of Mrs.\r\nJulia S. Vincent and Mrs. Isabella R. Slack, a bill was introduced in\r\nthe Legislature to found a Home for Dependent Children. The bill was\r\namended until when it finally passed it created two penal\r\ninstitutions, one for boys and one for girls.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 a bill proposing an amendment to the State constitution,\r\nconferring Full Suffrage on women, was brought to a vote in the\r\nAssembly and received 47 ayes, 69 noes. In 1895 a similar bill was\r\nlost in the Assembly.\r\n\r\nIn 1897, largely through the efforts of Miss Mary Perry, a bill was\r\nsecured creating a State Board of Charities, two members of which must\r\nbe women. This was supported by the Philanthropic Federation of\r\nWomen's Societies, who also presented one for women on school boards,\r\nwhich was not acted upon.\r\n\r\nBills for conferring School Suffrage on women have been presented on\r\nseveral occasions, but never have been considered. One has been\r\nsecured compelling employers to provide seats for female\r\nemployes.[353]\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy both obtain. If there are any descendants living,\r\nthe widow's dower is a life-interest in one-third of the real estate\r\nand a child's share of the personal property. If there are no\r\ndescendants, the widow is entitled to all her real estate which came\r\nto the husband through the marriage, and to all the undisposed-of\r\npersonal property of her own which by her written consent came into\r\nhis possession, not subject to the payment of his debts; and to\r\none-half of his separate real and personal estate absolutely, and\r\nsubject to the payment of his debts. If the husband or wife die\r\nintestate, leaving neither descendants, father, mother, brothers,\r\nsisters, or descendants of brothers or sisters, the entire estate,\r\nreal and personal, goes to the survivor. If a wife die, leaving no\r\ndescendants, her widower is entitled to one-half of her separate real\r\nand personal estate absolutely, subject to her debts. (Act of 1895.)\r\n\r\nIn 1889 an attempt was made to give a married woman control of her\r\nseparate real estate, which up to that time had belonged to the\r\nhusband. Endless confusion has resulted, as the law applies only to\r\nmarriages made since that date. To increase the complications a wife\r\nmay hold real property under three different tenures: An equitable\r\nseparate estate created by certain technical words in the conveyance,\r\nand this she can dispose of without the husband's joining in the deed;\r\na legal separate estate, which she can not convey without his joining;\r\nand a common-law estate in fee, of which the husband is entitled to\r\nthe rents and profits. In either case, if the wife continually permits\r\nthe husband to appear as the owner and to contract debts on the credit\r\nof the property, she is estopped from withholding it from his\r\ncreditors. There may be also a joint estate which goes to the survivor\r\nupon the death of either.\r\n\r\nNo married woman can act as executor or administrator.\r\n\r\nThe wife's separate property is liable for debts contracted by the\r\nhusband for necessaries for the family. If he is drunken and worthless\r\nshe may have him enjoined from squandering her property. For these\r\ncauses and for abandonment the court may authorize her to sell her\r\nseparate property without his signature.\r\n\r\nThe wife may insure the husband's life, or he may insure it for her,\r\nand the insurance can not be claimed by his creditors.\r\n\r\nA married woman may sue and be sued, make contracts and carry on\r\nbusiness in her own name, and possess her wages. She may recover in\r\nher own name for injuries which prevent her from conducting an\r\nindependent business, but not for those which interfere with the\r\nperformance of household duties, as her services in the home belong to\r\nthe husband. She may, however, bring suit in her own name for bodily\r\ninjuries.\r\n\r\nThe wife may sue for alienation of her husband's affections and\r\nrecover, according to a recent Supreme Court decision, \"even though\r\nthey may not be entirely alienated from her and though he may still\r\nentertain a sneaking affection for her.\"\r\n\r\nThe husband is liable for torts of the wife and for slanders spoken by\r\nher, although out of his presence and without his knowledge or\r\nconsent. (1899.)\r\n\r\nThe father is the guardian of the persons, estates and education of\r\nminor children. At his death the mother is guardian, but if she\r\nmarries again she loses the guardianship of the property because no\r\nmarried woman can be curator of a minor's estate.\r\n\r\nIf the husband abandon or fail to support his family, he may be fined\r\nand imprisoned and the court may decree their maintenance out of his\r\nproperty. The wife must live where and how the husband shall\r\ndetermine. If she chooses to live elsewhere his obligation to support\r\nher ceases. In case of divorce he must support the children, even if\r\ntheir custody is given to the mother.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 12 to 14 years in\r\n1889 and to 18 years in 1895. The penalty was reduced, however, and is\r\nat present \"imprisonment in the penitentiary for a term of two years,\r\nor a fine of not less than $100 or more than $500, or imprisonment in\r\nthe county jail not less than one month nor more than six months, or\r\nboth such fine and imprisonment, at the discretion of the court.\"\r\nBetween the ages of 14 and 18 years, the girl must be \"of previously\r\nchaste character.\"\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women possess no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: In 1897 the Supreme Court decided that women may hold\r\nany office from which they are not debarred by the constitution of the\r\nState. They are now eligible as county clerks, county school\r\ncommissioners and notaries public, and for various offices up to that\r\nof judge of the Supreme Court, which are not provided for by the\r\nconstitution. It is the opinion of lawyers that they may serve on city\r\nschool boards, and they have been nominated without objection, but\r\nnone has been elected. Women are barred, however, from all State\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nTwo women sit on the State Board of Charities, but they can not do so\r\non any other State boards.\r\n\r\nA number are now serving as county clerks and county commissioners.\r\n\r\nThe W. S. A. and the W. C. T. U. have secured the appointment of\r\nsalaried police matrons from the board of police commissioners in St.\r\nLouis, Kansas City and St. Joseph. There are also depot matrons in\r\nthese cities, and the first two have women guards at the jails and\r\nworkhouses.\r\n\r\nSt. Louis has a woman inspector of shops and factories.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: This was one of the first States in the Union to open its\r\nLaw and Medical Schools to women. In 1850, when Harriet Hosmer, the\r\nsculptor, could not secure admission to any institution in the East\r\nwhere she might study anatomy she was permitted to enter the Missouri\r\nMedical College.\r\n\r\nIn 1869 the Law College of Washington University at St. Louis admitted\r\nMiss Phoebe W. Couzins, and she received her degree in 1872.\r\n\r\nThe State University and all the State institutions of learning are\r\nco-educational. The Presbyterian Theological School admits women.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 5,979 men and 7,803 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $49.40; of the women,\r\n$42.40.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[350] The History is indebted for material for this chapter to Mrs.\r\nAddie M.

Willard, national president, came to\r\nMontana and formed a Territorial Woman's Christian Temperance Union in\r\nButte. At this time Miss Willard in her speeches, and the union in its\r\nadoption of a franchise department, made the initiative effort to\r\nobtain suffrage for the women of Montana. This organization has been\r\nhere, as elsewhere, a great educative force for its members, training\r\nthem in parliamentary law, broadening their ideas and preparing them\r\nfor citizenship. Out of its ranks have come the Rev. Alice S. N.\r\nBarnes, Mesdames Laura E. Howey, Delia A. Kellogg, Mary A. Wylie,\r\nMartha Rolfe Plassman, Anna A. Walker and many other earnest advocates\r\nof the ballot for women. Within the past five or six years a number of\r\nprofessional and business women have joined the suffrage forces and\r\nto-day they compose a majority of the active leaders.\r\n\r\nNo attempt was made to organize the State until Mrs. Emma Smith De Voe\r\nwas sent by the National Association in 1895. She visited most of the\r\nprominent towns and formed clubs or committees. The first State\r\nconvention was called at Helena in September of this year by the\r\nsuffrage association of that city, Miss Sarepta Sanders, president,\r\nand Mrs. Kellogg, secretary. It was assisted by Mrs. Carrie Chapman\r\nCatt, chairman of the national organization committee, to whose\r\neloquent addresses was due the great impetus the cause received at\r\nthis time.[355]\r\n\r\nMrs. De Voe again visited the State in the spring of 1896. The annual\r\nmeeting took place at Butte in November. Mrs. Harriet P. Sanders, wife\r\nof Senator Sanders, having declined re-election, was unanimously made\r\nhonorary president, and Mrs. Ella Knowles Haskell succeeded her in the\r\npresidency. Nearly 300 members were reported.\r\n\r\nA large and successful convention met at Helena in November, 1897,\r\nwhen a State central committee was appointed, with Mrs. Haskell as\r\nchairman and members in nearly every county. Madame F. Rowena Medini\r\nwas made president, but she left the State before her year of office\r\nhad expired and Dr. Mary B. Atwater filled her place. No convention\r\nbeing held in 1897 or 1898 she acted as president until that of\r\nOctober, 1899, when Dr. Maria M. Dean was elected. Mrs. Chapman Catt\r\nwas present.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. P. A. Dann of Great Falls, a contemporary of Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony, too much honor can not be given for her years of service and\r\nfinancial help. U. S. Senator Wilbur F. Sanders has been a loyal\r\nfriend. Foremost among the early workers for woman suffrage in Montana\r\nwas Mrs. Clara L. McAdow, whose energy and business talent made the\r\nSpotted Horse, a mine owned by herself and husband, a valuable\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nIn July, 1889, Henry B. Blackwell, corresponding secretary of the\r\nAmerican W. S. A., came to Montana to present the question to the\r\nConstitutional Convention. His address was received with warm applause\r\nbut the convention refused to adopt a woman suffrage amendment by 34\r\nyeas, 29 nays. A resolution was presented that the Legislature might\r\nextend the franchise to women whenever it should be deemed expedient,\r\nthus putting the matter out of the hands of its proverbial enemies.\r\nThe measure had able champions in B. F. Carpenter, W. M. Bickford, J.\r\nE. Rickards, Hiram Knowles, P. W. McAdow, J. A. Callaway, Peter Breen,\r\nT. E. Collins, W. A. Burleigh, W. R. Ramsdell, Francis E. Sargeant,\r\nWilliam A. Clark (now U. S. Senator), its president, and others.\r\nProminent among those opposed were Martin Maginnis and Allen Joy. It\r\nwas lost by a tie vote, July 30. A proposal to submit the question\r\nseparately to the electors was defeated by the same vote, August 12.\r\nThe constitution conferred School Suffrage, which women already\r\npossessed under Territorial government, and gave to taxpaying women a\r\nvote on questions of taxation.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In 1895 women secured an enactment that\r\nthe commissioners of any county, at the request of a certain number of\r\npetitioners, must call a special election for a vote on licensing the\r\nsale of liquor. A two-thirds vote is necessary to prohibit this. Women\r\nthemselves can neither petition nor vote on the question.\r\n\r\nThis year a bill was introduced by Representative John S. Huseby for a\r\nconstitutional amendment granting suffrage to women. It was passed in\r\nthe House, 45 yeas, 12 nays; indefinitely postponed in the Senate by a\r\n\"rising vote,\" 14 yeas, 4 nays.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 a systematic effort was made to secure a bill for this\r\namendment. Mrs. Ella Knowles Haskell, chairman of the State central\r\ncommittee, invaded the legislative halls with an able corps of\r\nassistants from the W. S. A. Petitions signed by about 3,000 citizens\r\nwere presented, and it looked for a time as if the bill might pass. It\r\nwas debated in the House and attracted much attention from the press,\r\nbut lacked five votes of the required two-thirds majority. It was not\r\nacted upon in the Senate.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Dr. Mary B. Atwater, then president of the State Association,\r\nwith other officers and members, succeeded in having a Suffrage\r\nAmendment Bill introduced. Some excellent work was done, but the\r\nmeasure was lost in Committee of the Whole.\r\n\r\nDower is retained but curtesy abolished. If there is only one child,\r\nor the lawful issue of one child, the surviving husband or wife\r\nreceives one-half of the entire estate, real and personal; if there is\r\nmore than one child, or one child and the lawful issue of one or more\r\ndeceased children, the survivor receives one-third. If there is no\r\nissue living the survivor takes one-half of the whole unless there is\r\nneither father, mother, brother, sister nor their descendants, when\r\nthe widow or widower takes it all.\r\n\r\nThe wife may mortgage or convey her separate property without the\r\nhusband's signature. He may do this but can not impair her dower right\r\nto one-third.\r\n\r\nA married woman may act as executor, administrator or guardian. She\r\nmay also sue and be sued and make contracts in her own name.\r\n\r\nA married woman can control her earnings by becoming a sole trader\r\nthrough the necessary legal process. She thus makes herself\r\nresponsible for the maintenance of her children.\r\n\r\nThe father, if living, or if not, the mother, while she remains\r\nunmarried and if suitable, is entitled to the guardianship of minor\r\nchildren. In case of divorce, other things being equal, if the child\r\nbe of tender years, it is given to the mother, and if of an age to\r\nrequire education and preparation for business, then to the father.\r\n\r\nBy the code of 1895 the husband is required to furnish support for the\r\nfamily as far as he is able, and the wife must help if necessary. Her\r\npersonal property is subject to debts incurred for family expenses.\r\nEven though divorce be denied, the court may award maintenance to wife\r\nand children.\r\n\r\nMontana is one of three States which make 18 years the legal age for\r\nthe marriage of girls. In all others it ranges from 12 to 16 years.\r\n\r\nIn 1887, on petition of women, the \"age of protection\" for girls was\r\nraised from 10 to 15 years, and in 1895 to 16. The penalty is\r\nimprisonment not less than five years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women may vote for school trustees on the same terms as men,\r\nbut not for other school officers. They had this privilege under\r\nTerritorial government. Those possessing property may vote also on all\r\nquestions submitted to taxpayers. These privileges were incorporated\r\nin the first State constitution.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women may serve as county superintendents or hold any\r\nschool district office.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 there were two women county superintendents; now every county\r\nin the State has a woman in this office. The superintendent of the\r\nHelena schools is a woman. The Rev. Alice S. N. Barnes held the\r\nposition of school trustee as early as 1888. Dr. Maria M. Dean has\r\nbeen elected three times in succession as a trustee in Helena. She is\r\nchairman of the board and has been influential in many progressive\r\nmeasures.\r\n\r\nWomen have served on library boards and been city librarians. Miss Lou\r\nGuthrie has been for a number of years librarian of the State Law\r\nLibrary, and Mrs. Laura E. Howey fills this position in the State\r\nHistorical Library.\r\n\r\nThere has been a woman on the State Board of Charities since its\r\norganization in 1893, Mrs. Howey, Mrs. M. S. Cummins and Mrs. Lewis\r\nPenwell having been successively elected.\r\n\r\nDr. Mary B. Atwater has been for over three years chairman of the\r\nBoard of Health of Helena.\r\n\r\nWomen served as notaries public until a ruling of Attorney-General C.\r\nB. Nolan (1901) declared this illegal.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, the first year the Populist party put a ticket in the field,\r\nit nominated Miss Ella Knowles for the office of Attorney-General. She\r\nmade a spirited campaign, addressing more than eighty audiences, and\r\nalone organized some fourteen counties, being the first Populist to\r\nspeak in them. She ran 5,000 votes ahead of her ticket, in a State\r\nwhich casts only about 50,000. The contest was so close that it was\r\nthree weeks before it was decided who had been elected; but when the\r\nvotes came in from the outlying precincts, where she was unknown, it\r\nwas found that her Republican opponent, H. J. Haskell, had a majority.\r\nMiss Knowles was then appointed Assistant Attorney-General, an office\r\nwhich she filled for four years to the eminent satisfaction of the\r\npeople. During this time she married her rival.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No occupation is now legally forbidden to women. Mainly\r\nthrough the efforts of Mrs. Haskell, a bill was passed by the\r\nLegislature of 1889 which gave women the right to practice law. The\r\nRev. Alice S. N. Barnes was ordained in the Congregational Church in\r\n1896, and has preached regularly ever since. In 1889 she was chosen as\r\nmoderator at the Conference of the Congregational Churches of Montana,\r\nat Helena.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The educational advantages for women are the same as those\r\naccorded men. All institutions of learning--the State University, the\r\nAgricultural College, even the School of Mines--are open to both\r\nsexes.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 201 men and 885 women teachers. The\r\naverage monthly salary of the men is $69.28; of the women, $48.61.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nMontana women were awarded seven medals at the World's Fair in Chicago\r\nin 1893. Their botanical exhibit was one of the most notable at the\r\nexposition. It was artistically arranged by Mrs. Jennie H. Moore, the\r\nflowers being all scientifically labeled and properly classified. Of\r\nthe $100,000 appropriated to the use of the State Commission, the men\r\nassigned $10,000 to the women for their department, exercising no\r\nsupervision over them. At the close of the exposition they brought\r\nback $2,800, which they turned into the State treasury, and $3,000\r\nworth of furniture, which they presented to various State\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 there was an exciting contest over removing the location of\r\nthe permanent capital and some fear that Helena would lose it. A\r\nnumber of her leading women, in a special car provided by the Northern\r\nPacific R. R., visited the prominent towns in Eastern Montana,\r\nspeaking and working in the interest of their city and undoubtedly\r\ngaining many votes for Helena, which was selected instead of the\r\nrival, Anaconda.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Mrs. Haskell was made a delegate to the Populist convention of\r\nLewis and Clarke County, which met in Helena, and also to the Populist\r\nState and National Conventions. She took a prominent part in their\r\nproceedings, and was instrumental in securing a woman suffrage plank\r\nin the Populist State platform after a hard fight on the floor of the\r\nconvention. At the Populist convention in St. Louis that year she was\r\nchosen a member of the National Committee.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1900 a number of prominent women of Helena appeared\r\nas representatives of the suffragists before the Lewis and Clarke\r\nCounty Conventions, and before the State conventions--Republican,\r\nDemocrat and Populist--asking that they insert a plank in their\r\nplatforms recommending the submission of the question of woman\r\nsuffrage to the voters. Only the Populists adopted it. The ladies also\r\nattended the State conventions of the three parties with the same\r\nresolution; but the Populists alone indorsed it, \"demanding\" suffrage\r\nfor women.\r\n\r\nOne of the important factors in this movement is the Woman's Relief\r\nCorps, an organization which has grown in strength during the last\r\ndecade and is making its members staunch patriots and woman\r\nsuffragists. It has had an educative influence equal to that of the W.\r\nC. T. U. but on different lines. Women are actively identified with\r\nlodges and clubs, many of the latter being members of the General\r\nFederation of Women's Clubs.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[354] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Mary Long\r\nAlderson of Helena, one of the first officers of the State Woman\r\nSuffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[355] Officers elected: President, Mrs. Harriet P. Sanders;\r\nvice-president, Mrs. Martha Rolfe Plassman; corresponding secretary,\r\nMrs. Delia A. Kellogg; recording secretary, Mrs. Mary Long Alderson;\r\ntreasurer, Dr. Mary B. Atwater; auditors, Mrs. Martha E. Dunckel and\r\nMrs. Hiram Knowles; delegate-at-large, Mrs. Mary A. Wylie. Dr. Atwater\r\nhas been elected to the same office at each succeeding convention.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LI.\r\n\r\nNEBRASKA.[356]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of the constitutional amendment to confer the\r\nsuffrage, which was submitted to the voters of Nebraska in 1882, the\r\nwomen were not discouraged, but continued to hold their State\r\nconventions as usual. That of 1884 took place at York, in January, and\r\nwas welcomed by Mayor Harlan.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 16, 17, 1885, the annual meeting was held at Lincoln. Mrs. Ada\r\nM. Bittenbender was the principal speaker, and the convention was\r\nspecially favored with music by the noted singer of ante-bellum days,\r\nJames G. Clark. Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby, editor of the _Woman's\r\nTribune_, was elected president.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1886 met at Madison, August 18, 19, and was\r\naddressed by Mrs. Elizabeth Lyle Saxon of New Orleans.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 6-8, 1887, the convention assembled in the Hall of\r\nRepresentatives in Lincoln. It was fortunate in having Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony, who was enthusiastically received by large audiences. The\r\nchancellor postponed the opening lecture of the university course so\r\nthat the students might hear her address. Mrs. Saxon again rendered\r\nvaluable assistance.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1888 met in the opera house at Omaha, December 3, 4,\r\nmemorable in being honored by the presence of the two great leaders,\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, president, and Miss Susan B. Anthony,\r\nvice-president-at-large of the National Association. A reception was\r\nheld at Hotel Paxton, and short speeches were made by prominent men. A\r\nnotable feature was the exhibit of the rolls containing the names of\r\n12,000 Nebraska men and women asking for equal suffrage.\r\n\r\nThe convention for 1889 took place in May, at Kearney, James Clement\r\nAmbrose being among the speakers.\r\n\r\nFremont claimed the tenth annual meeting, Nov. 12, 1890, Miss\r\nAnthony, and Mrs. Julia B. Nelson of Minnesota stopping off to attend\r\nit on their return from several months' campaigning in South Dakota.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1891 was held at Hastings in October, and that of\r\n1892 at Pender, July 1, 2. In 1893 all efforts were concentrated on\r\nthe work done at the World's Fair in Chicago, and the raising of money\r\nto assist the Colorado campaign, and the convention was omitted.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony, now national president, also attended the meeting of\r\n1894, in Beatrice, November 7, 8. This time she was on her way home\r\nfrom a campaign in Kansas for a suffrage amendment, to which the\r\nNebraska association had contributed liberally. A telegram announcing\r\nits defeat was handed her on the platform, just as she was about to\r\nbegin her speech, and no one who was present ever will forget her\r\ntouching account of the efforts which had been made in various States\r\nfor this measure during the past twenty-seven years. The delegates\r\nwere welcomed by Mayor Schultz.\r\n\r\nDavid City was selected for the next convention, Oct. 30, 31, 1895;\r\nand that of 1896 was enjoyed at the summer session of the Long Pine\r\nChautauqua Assembly. Mrs. Colby had spent two months lecturing\r\nthroughout the State and preparing for this meeting. Money was raised\r\nfor the Idaho suffrage campaign, then in progress. Mrs. Colby and Miss\r\nElizabeth Abbott addressed the Resolution Committee of the Populist\r\nState convention, asking for a woman suffrage plank.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of 1897, at Lincoln, September 30, was assisted by Mrs.\r\nIda Crouch Hazlett, a lecturer and organizer from Denver, who was\r\nengaged for State work.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1898, the convention was held in Omaha during the\r\nexecutive meeting of the National Council of Women, which enabled it\r\nto have addresses by Miss Anthony, the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nvice-president-at-large of the National Association, Mrs. Adelaide\r\nBallard of Iowa, and other prominent speakers. Mrs. Colby declining to\r\nstand for re-election, after sixteen years' service, Mrs. Mary Smith\r\nHayward was the choice of the association. One hundred dollars were\r\nsent to South Dakota for amendment campaign work.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1899, the National W. S. A. sent eight organizers into the\r\nState to hold a series of forty-nine county conventions; 250 meetings\r\nwere held, 18 county organizations effected and 38 local clubs formed.\r\nThe canvass ended in an enthusiastic convention in the capitol\r\nbuilding at Lincoln, with Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the\r\nnational organization committee, the Rev. Ida C. Hultin of Illinois,\r\nMrs. Evelyn H. Belden of Iowa, Miss Laura A. Gregg of Kansas and Miss\r\nMary G. Hay of New York, among the speakers. State headquarters were\r\nopened at Omaha with Miss Gregg in charge. Her work has been so\r\neffective that it has been necessary to employ assistants to send out\r\npress articles, arrange for lectures, etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 a very successful annual meeting took place in Blair, October\r\n23, 24, with a representation almost double that of the previous year\r\nand an elaborate program. Mrs. Chapman Catt was again present, there\r\nwas much enthusiasm and it was resolved to continue the efforts to\r\ncreate a public sentiment which would insure a woman suffrage clause\r\nin the new State constitution which is expected in the near\r\nfuture.[357]\r\n\r\nAmong the many flourishing local societies may be mentioned that of\r\nTable Rock, which is so strong an influence in the community that the\r\nneed of any other club for literary or public work is not felt. It\r\nholds an annual banquet to which husbands and friends are invited, and\r\nthe husbands, in turn, under the name of the H. H. (Happy Husband)\r\nClub give a reception to the suffragists, managing it entirely\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\nThe society at Chadron, under the inspiration of Mrs. Hayward, is one\r\nof the most active, and has sent money to assist campaigns in other\r\nStates. A canvass of the town in February, 1901, showed that 96 per\r\ncent. of the women wanted full suffrage.\r\n\r\nMrs. Colby organized a Club in Lincoln which has done excellent\r\nservice under the leadership of Dr. Inez C. Philbrick.\r\n\r\nSuffrage headquarters have been established at the Chautauquas held at\r\nLong Pine, Beatrice, Salem and Crete, and various Woman's Days have\r\nbeen held under the auspices of the State Association, at which\r\nspeakers of national reputation have made addresses. Anthony and\r\nStanton Birthdays have been largely observed by the suffrage clubs.\r\n\r\nThe history of the Nebraska work for the past sixteen years is\r\ninterwoven with that of the president, Mrs. Colby, who has given her\r\nlife and money freely to the cause. At a convention in Grand Island in\r\nMay, 1883, it was voted to establish a suffrage paper at Beatrice, for\r\nwhich the State association was to be financially responsible, and\r\nMrs. Colby was made editor. A year later, when the executive committee\r\nwithdrew from the arrangement, she herself assumed the entire burden,\r\nand has edited and published the _Woman's Tribune_ to the present\r\ntime. In 1888 she issued the paper in Washington, D. C., during the\r\nsessions of the International Woman's Council and the National W. S.\r\nA., publishing eight editions in the two weeks, four of sixteen and\r\nfour of twelve pages, each averaging daily 12,500 copies. A few years\r\nafterwards the office was permanently removed to Washington. As long\r\nas Mrs. Colby was a resident of Nebraska she stood at the head of\r\nevery phase of the movement to obtain equal rights for women. Miss\r\nMary Fairbrother, editor and proprietor of the _Woman's Weekly_, has\r\nmade her paper a valuable ally.\r\n\r\nMiss Helen M. Goff, a lawyer, acted as corresponding secretary of the\r\nState Association for many years, speaking for the cause in political\r\ncampaigns, holding a suffrage booth at State fairs, and working in the\r\nLegislature for suffrage bills.[358]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In 1887 a bill for Municipal Suffrage was\r\nintroduced by Senator Snell of Fairbury, and by Representative Cole of\r\nJuniata. Mrs. Colby had secured 3,000 signatures for this measure, and\r\nwith Mrs. Jennie F. Holmes, president of the State Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union, worked all winter to secure its passage.[359]\r\n\r\nIn 1893 three bills were introduced into the Legislature relating to\r\nsuffrage for women, and one asking for a law providing for police\r\nmatrons in cities of 25,000 or more inhabitants. Miss Goff remained at\r\nthe capital all winter looking after these bills. Mrs. Colby,\r\nrepresenting the State W. S. A., and Mrs. Zara A. Wilson the State W.\r\nC. T. U., had charge of the Bill for Municipal Suffrage. J. F. Kessler\r\nintroduced this in the House and worked for it. It was defeated by 35\r\nayes, 48 noes.\r\n\r\nThe bill for Full Suffrage was introduced into the House by G. C.\r\nLingenfelter, and championed by W. F. Porter (now Secretary of State)\r\nand others. It was defeated by 42 ayes, 47 noes. The Populist members\r\nsupported this, but considered that Municipal Suffrage discriminated\r\nagainst women in the country. The bill for extended School Suffrage\r\nwas introduced too late to reach a vote. The Police Matron Bill was\r\ncarried.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 the W. S. A. decided to do no legislative work except to\r\nsecond the efforts of the W. C. T. U. to have the \"age of protection\"\r\nfor girls raised to 18 years; and to secure a resolution asking\r\nCongress to submit a woman suffrage amendment to the Federal\r\nConstitution. The latter measure was not acted upon; the former was\r\nsuccessful.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 bills were introduced for the Federal Amendment, for Municipal\r\nSuffrage, to allow women property holders to vote on issuing bonds,\r\nand to make the right of the surviving husband or wife equal in the\r\nfamily estate. Both branches of the Legislature invited Mrs. Colby to\r\naddress them. Immediately afterward the House Judiciary Committee\r\napproved an amendment to the State constitution, striking out the word\r\n\"male,\" but this was defeated later in the session. The other bills\r\nwere not reported from the committees.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 a hearing was granted to a committee from the suffrage\r\nassociation urging a resolution asking Congress to submit a woman\r\nsuffrage amendment to the State Legislatures, and such a measure was\r\nreported to the House but not adopted.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy both obtain. A widow is entitled to the life use of\r\none-third of the real estate. In case the husband die without a will,\r\nafter the payment of all debts, charges, etc., she may have household\r\nfurniture to the value of $250 and other personal property not\r\nexceeding $200. If any residue remains she is entitled to the same\r\nshare that a child receives. If there is no issue living, a widow\r\ntakes the use for life of the entire estate, both real and personal.\r\nIf there is no kindred of the husband, the widow comes into absolute\r\npossession. If a wife die, leaving no issue, the husband has the life\r\nuse of all her real estate. If she leave children by a former husband\r\nthey are entitled to all of the estate which did not come to her as a\r\ngift from her surviving husband. If she leave issue by the latter\r\nonly, or by both, then the widower has a life interest in one-third of\r\nher real estate. After the payment of her debts her personal property\r\nis distributed in the same way as her real estate.\r\n\r\nThe wife can mortgage or sell her real estate without the husband's\r\nsignature and without regard to his curtesy. He can do the same with\r\nhis separate property but subject to her dower. Both must join in an\r\nincumbrance or sale of the homestead.\r\n\r\nA married woman may control her own property and wages and carry on\r\nbusiness in her own name.\r\n\r\nFather and mother have equal guardianship and custody of minor\r\nchildren. (1895.)\r\n\r\nThe husband is expected to furnish suitable maintenance according to\r\nhis own ideas. The property which belonged to the wife before marriage\r\ncan be levied on for the husband's debts for necessaries furnished the\r\nfamily if he have no property.\r\n\r\nThe mother is not \"next of kin\" and can not sue for damages to a minor\r\nchild. In 1900 a child of thirteen was injured by a locomotive, and\r\nthe Judge held that the father and not the mother was entitled to\r\nbring suit, although she had a divorce years before and had brought up\r\nthe child without any assistance from him.\r\n\r\nIf a divorce is granted for the wife's adultery \"the husband may hold\r\nsuch of her personal estate as the court may term just and\r\nreasonable.\" If she secure a divorce on account of his adultery, \"the\r\ncourt may restore to her the whole, or such part as may seem just, _of\r\nher own property_ which she had at marriage. If this is insufficient\r\nfor the support of herself and her children the court may decree\r\nalimony from the husband's estate.\"\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised in 1885 from 10 to 12\r\nyears; in 1887 from 12 to 15; in 1895 from 15 to 18. The penalty is\r\nimprisonment in the penitentiary not more than twenty nor less than\r\nthree years, but the law provides that if such \"female child is over\r\n15 and previously unchaste\" this penalty shall not be inflicted. For\r\nsuch the law offers no protection. Nor shall there be conviction for\r\nthe crime against a child of any age without other evidence than her\r\nown testimony. (1895.)\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: In 1869 School Suffrage was conferred on women. In 1875 the\r\nLegislature repealed this law except for widows and spinsters. In 1881\r\nit was again changed, and women since then have voted in school\r\ndistrict matters on the same terms as men; _i. e._, if parents of\r\nchildren of school age or assessed on property real or personal they\r\nmay vote at all elections pertaining to schools. They can not,\r\nhowever, vote for State or county superintendents or county\r\nsupervisors (commissioners). As the last named levy the taxes, and the\r\nother two are the most important officers connected with the schools,\r\nit will be seen that women are deprived of the most valuable school\r\nvote. All efforts, however, to secure an extension of the school\r\nfranchise have resulted in failure.\r\n\r\nAs it requires a majority of the highest number of votes cast at an\r\nelection to carry an amendment, it is useless to ask the Legislature\r\nto submit one conferring Full Suffrage upon women.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: There is nothing in the State constitution or the\r\nstatutes making women ineligible to any elective office except\r\nmembership in the Legislature.\r\n\r\nAlthough they are not allowed to vote for county superintendents there\r\nare at present sixteen women filling this office, eight of them\r\nserving a second term and three a third, while nineteen are\r\nsuperintendents or principals of schools. A woman was candidate on the\r\nFusion ticket for regent of the State University; another has been\r\nregistrar since the university opened, and one is at present recorder.\r\n\r\nMrs. Ada M. Bittenbender was candidate for Supreme Judge.\r\n\r\nA woman is deputy State auditor. Women are serving or have served as\r\npostmasters and as clerks in both houses of the Legislature, clerk of\r\nthe State library and member of the State examining committee of\r\neducation. Miss Mary Fairbrother was proof-reader in the House in\r\n1899. Miss Helen M. Goff is assistant reporter in the State department\r\nof the Judiciary. Women act as notaries public.\r\n\r\nThe W. S. A. and W. C. T. U. secured a bill requiring the appointment\r\nof women physicians at three State insane asylums. There are matrons\r\nat all of the State institutions for the blind, feeble-minded, etc.,\r\nand also at the Girls' Industrial School, although the superintendent\r\nis always a man. The Milford Industrial School has a woman physician,\r\na woman superintendent and a board of five women visitors. At the Home\r\nfor the Friendless all the officers and employees are required to be\r\nwomen and there is a board of women visitors.\r\n\r\nAll cities of 25,000 or more are required to appoint police matrons at\r\n$50 per month. This includes only Omaha and Lincoln.\r\n\r\nA woman is Secretary of the Board of Trade in Omaha and official agent\r\nfor the Humane Society with police powers.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen. A woman is president of one bank and vice-president of another.\r\nAmong the many in newspaper work, an Indian, Mrs. Susette La F.\r\nTibbles, is prominent.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All institutions of learning are open to women. In the\r\npublic schools there are 2,038 men and 7,154 women teachers. The\r\naverage monthly salary of the men is $45.05, of the women, $36.56.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Prohibition party always puts a suffrage plank in its State\r\nplatform and women candidates on its ticket, even for the office of\r\nLieutenant-Governor, but it polls so small a vote that this can be\r\nonly complimentary. The Populist and Republican parties have indorsed\r\nequal suffrage at county conventions and elected women on their\r\ntickets. Women go as delegates to the Prohibition and Populist\r\nconventions. One of the strongest of the State organizations is the\r\nWoman's Relief Corps.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[356] The History is indebted for the material for this chapter to\r\nMrs. Mary Smith Hayward of Chadron, former president of the State\r\nWoman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[357] The present officers of the association are: President, Mrs.\r\nClara A. Young; vice-president, Mrs. Amanda J. Marble; corresponding\r\nsecretary, Miss Nelly E. Taylor; recording secretary, Mrs. Ida L.\r\nDenny; treasurer, Mrs. K. W. Sutherland; auditors, Mrs. Mary Smith\r\nHayward and Mrs. Getty W. Drury.\r\n\r\n[358] Other names which appear from time to time as doing good work\r\nfor this cause are the Hon. J. D. Ream, M. H. Marble, J. W. Dundas,\r\nMesdames A. J. Marble, Susanna A. Kendall, Irene Hernandez, Miriam\r\nBaird Buck, Lucy Merwin, Vannessa Goff, Maria C. Arter, Mary E.\r\nMcMenemy, F. C. Norris, M. A. Van Middlesworth, M. A. Cotton, Misses\r\nViola Kaufman and Edna Naylor.\r\n\r\n[359] Mrs. Colby gives this interesting bit of description: \"Our\r\nhusbands were both in the Senate. We had apartments in the same house,\r\nwhere, hobnobbing over our partnership housekeeping, we planned our\r\npublic work. Our husbands each had a spell of sickness at the same\r\ntime, and while our functions of State presidency were temporarily\r\nexchanged for those of nursing, our enemies took advantage of us and\r\nkilled that bill, on the very day, February 15, that Gov. John A.\r\nMartin signed the bill under which the women of Kansas have ever since\r\nenjoyed the municipal ballot.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LII.\r\n\r\nNEVADA.[360]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe question of equal political rights for women always has been a\r\nsubject of discussion in Nevada. Through the efforts of Miss Hannah K.\r\nClapp and a few other women a suffrage bill was passed by the Senate\r\nin 1883, but was defeated in the House. Miss Mary Babcock was one of\r\nthe most efficient of these early workers. Many party leaders,\r\nwhenever opportunity permitted, have referred to the justice of\r\nenfranchising the women who with the men braved the dangers and\r\nendured the hardships of pioneer life, and are equally interested in\r\nthe material development and political well-being of the State. After\r\nthe organization of the Nevada Woman's Christian Temperance Union the\r\nsuperintendent of the franchise department distributed literature,\r\nbrought up the topic at public meetings, urged it as a subject of\r\ndebate in clubs and schools and thus secured a steady gain in suffrage\r\nsentiment.\r\n\r\nThe first step toward associated effort was taken by the women of\r\nAustin, Nov. 30, 1894, in forming the Lucy Stone Non-Partisan Equal\r\nSuffrage League. One or two others were organized that year, and a\r\ngeneral agitation was begun through press and petition work by the\r\nsuffragists in every community.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1895 the visit of Miss Susan B. Anthony, president of\r\nthe National Association, and the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nvice-president-at-large, who were on their way to California, created\r\nsuch widespread enthusiasm that a new impetus was given to the\r\nmovement. A little later Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe of Illinois was sent by\r\nthe National Association to canvass the State with the help of the\r\nlocal workers. As a result a convention was held at Reno, October 29,\r\n30. Mrs. DeVoe and Mrs. Frances A. Williamson were the principal\r\nspeakers, and the ten minutes' addresses by the delegates from various\r\ncounties were very clever and acceptable. A State Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation was formed with Mrs. Williamson as president; Miss Clapp\r\nand Dr. Eliza Cook, vice-presidents; Fannie Weller, corresponding\r\nsecretary; Phoebe Stanton Marshall, recording secretary; Elda A. Orr,\r\ntreasurer; Kate A. Martin and Alice Ede, auditors; Annie Warren, press\r\nwork; Mary A. Boyd, State Fair work; Emma B. Blossom, superintendent\r\nof literature; Marcella Rinkle, member national executive committee.\r\n\r\nThe president, who was also chairman of the legislative work\r\ncommittee, was in the lecture field four months. She had to act as her\r\nown advance agent, but during this time she spoke in every city and\r\ntown in the State and organized numerous clubs. Her meetings were well\r\nattended, and great interest was manifested. The second convention was\r\nheld at Reno, Sept. 24, 1896, with every county represented. Mrs. Elda\r\nA. Orr was elected president and Mrs. Williamson, State organizer and\r\nlecturer. Mrs. Orr has ever since been continued as president, and to\r\nno one person in Nevada is the cause of woman suffrage so much\r\nindebted for hospitality, financial aid and valuable work.\r\n\r\nThe public meeting called on November 9 to greet Miss Anthony and Mrs.\r\nCarrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the national organization committee,\r\nwas very successful. Miss Anthony gave a _résumé_ of the exciting\r\ncampaign just closed in California, and made an object lesson of its\r\ncritical points which greatly amused the audience. Mrs. Chapman Catt\r\nfollowed in an able argument on woman suffrage as the best and safest\r\nmeans to secure and maintain good government.\r\n\r\nIn order to give the movement a more pronounced individuality Mrs.\r\nWilliamson and her daughter, M. Laura Williamson, founded the _Nevada\r\nCitizen_, a monthly paper devoted to the social, civil and industrial\r\nadvancement of women. They edited and managed it, publishing it at\r\ntheir own risk, and it received a liberal patronage. After a\r\nsuccessful existence of two years, business called both from the State\r\nand it was discontinued.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 Mrs. Williamson again canvassed the various counties, and the\r\nmost prominent men and women were found willing to give the measure\r\ntheir indorsement. The third annual meeting was held at Carson City,\r\nOctober 30, with delegates from most of the counties. The numerous\r\ngreetings from leading politicians showed an increasing interest in\r\nthis question. Mrs. Orr and Mrs. Williamson were both re-elected. The\r\nformer made an able address, and Mrs. Frances Folsom gave a general\r\nreview of the laws relating to the property rights of women in the\r\ndifferent States.\r\n\r\nThe fourth convention was postponed till the meeting of the\r\nLegislature in the winter of 1899, in order that the speakers might\r\nappear before that body with their arguments for the submission of a\r\nwoman suffrage amendment to the voters.[361]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In 1895 a bill was introduced in the\r\nHouse by Henry H. Beck, to amend the State constitution by eliminating\r\nthe word \"male\" from before the word \"citizen\" wherever it occurs. All\r\namendment bills have to pass two successive Legislatures and then be\r\nsubmitted to the voters. The Rev. Mila Tupper Maynard and Mrs. Frances\r\nA. Williamson managed the legislative work this year. The former made\r\nan eloquent address before the Legislature in joint assembly. An\r\nexciting debate followed in the House, but the bill was defeated by\r\nsix votes. About ten days later it was introduced in the Senate by Dr.\r\nWilliam Comins, who supported it with an able speech. It was strongly\r\nopposed but finally passed by a two-thirds vote. Toward the close of\r\nthe session it was reconsidered in the House, and after a spirited\r\ndebate was passed by four votes.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the legislative work was conducted by Mrs. Williamson. She\r\nread a brief of the constitutional grounds on which women claim the\r\nright of suffrage before the Judiciary Committees of both Houses, and\r\naddressed the Legislature in joint assembly.[362] This year the bill\r\nfor a constitutional amendment was introduced in the Senate by Dr.\r\nComins. The Judiciary Committee recommended its passage, and after a\r\nlively debate it received a two-thirds vote. Later on the bill was\r\npresented in the House by Frank Norcross. It was held in committee and\r\ndelayed in every possible way, but finally was brought up in joint\r\nassembly. A stubborn debate followed, in which the advocates made an\r\nable defense, but it was defeated by a tie vote. A motion to\r\nreconsider it was defeated also.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the Constitutional Amendment Bill again passed the Senate by\r\nthe usual two-thirds vote, and was defeated again in the House by the\r\nusual small vote.\r\n\r\nGovernors Colcord, Jones and Sadler recommended in their biennial\r\nmessages to the Legislature that the proposed suffrage amendment to\r\nthe State constitution be submitted to the voters.[363] The Reno\r\n_Gazette_ and Wadsworth _Dispatch_ merit special mention for the able\r\nmanner in which they have advocated the suffrage movement.\r\n\r\nA married woman may control her separate property if a list of it is\r\nfiled with the county recorder, but unless it is kept constantly\r\ninventoried and recorded it becomes community property.\r\n\r\nThe community property, both real and personal, which includes all\r\naccumulated after marriage, is under absolute control of the husband,\r\nand at the death of the wife all of it belongs to him without\r\nadministration. On the death of the husband the wife is entitled to\r\none-half of it. If he die leaving no will and no children, she may\r\nclaim all of it after she has secured the payment of debts to the\r\nsatisfaction of creditors. The inheritance of separate property is the\r\nsame for both, and either may claim a life interest in a homestead not\r\nexceeding $5,000 in value.\r\n\r\nTo become a sole trader a woman must comply with certain legal\r\nconditions. Her earnings are considered by law to belong to her if her\r\nhusband has allowed her to appropriate them to her own use, when they\r\nare regarded _as a gift from him to her_.\r\n\r\nA married woman may sue and be sued and make contracts in her own\r\nname.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the children and may appoint one\r\nby will. If this is not done, the mother, if suitable, is the guardian\r\nwhile she remains unmarried.\r\n\r\nThe husband is required to furnish the necessaries of life to the\r\nfamily; but there is no penalty for failure to do so, except that\r\nwhere the neglect has been continued for one year, when it could have\r\nbeen avoided by ordinary industry, the wife is entitled to a divorce.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 12 to 14\r\nyears. The penalty is imprisonment in the penitentiary for a term of\r\nnot less than five years, which may extend for life.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women possess no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women are not eligible to any elective or appointive\r\noffices except those of county school superintendents and school\r\ntrustees. There are serving at present one county superintendent and\r\nfifteen trustees.\r\n\r\nWomen act as clerks in State, county and city offices. They can not\r\nserve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen. A number are carrying on mining, and have had mines patented in\r\ntheir own names.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Women are admitted to all educational institutions on the\r\nsame terms as men.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 40 men and 274 women teachers. The\r\naverage monthly salary of the men is $101; of the women, $61.50.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[360] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Frances A.\r\nWilliamson, first president of the State Equal Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[361] Among those who have filled the various offices are: Vice\r\npresidents, Margaret Campbell and Susan Humphreys, corresponding\r\nsecretaries, May Gill and Catharine Shaw; auditors, A. A. Rattan, Mary\r\nCowen and Laura A. Huffines; superintendent of press work, Margaret\r\nFurlong; superintendent of literature, Hester Tate; members national\r\nexecutive committee, Caroline B. Norcross and Elizabeth Webster.\r\n\r\nProminent among the active suffragists, besides those already\r\nmentioned, are Sadie Bath, Lettie Richards, Martha J. Wright, Gerty\r\nGrey, Annie Ronnow, Emma Hilp, Mary Haslett, Mamie Dickey, Edith\r\nJenkins, Louisa Loschenkohl, Clara Dooley, Mary Bonner, Eliza Timlin\r\nand Josie Marsh.\r\n\r\n[362] Mrs. Williamson was assisted by Elda A. Orr, Elizabeth Webster,\r\nMary Alt, Mary A. Boyd, Jane Frazer, Kate A. Martin, Elizabeth Evans,\r\nMarcella Rinkle, Susan Humphreys, Sara Reynolds, Frances Folsom, Emma\r\nB. Blossom and others, whose womanly and dignified work was\r\ncomplimented by the legislative body and the public in general.\r\n\r\n[363] Among the members of both Houses who from time to time have\r\nchampioned this question and favored all legislation for the\r\nadvancement of women are Messrs. Bell, Birchfield, Coryell, Denton,\r\nErnest, Garrard, Gregooich, Haines, Julien, Kaiser, Lord, Mante,\r\nMartin, Marshall, McHardy, McNaughton, McCone, Murphy, Richards,\r\nSkagg, Vanderleith and Williamson.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIII.\r\n\r\nNEW HAMPSHIRE.\r\n\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire has been rich in distinguished citizens who believed in\r\nwoman suffrage. Ex-United States Senator Henry W. Blair always has\r\nbeen one of its most devoted advocates, and his successor, Dr. Jacob\r\nH. Gallinger, is no less a staunch friend. The names of both for many\r\nyears have stood as vice-presidents of the State Association. From\r\n1868 the Hon. Nathaniel P. and Mrs. Armenia S. White were the pillars\r\nof the movement and there was an efficient organization. His death in\r\n1880 and her advancing years deprived it of active leadership and,\r\nwhile the sentiment throughout the State continued strong, there was\r\nlittle organized work. Mrs. White was president for many years and\r\nafterwards was made honorary president. Parker Pillsbury was for a\r\nlong time vice-president and later the Hon. Oliver Branch. Mrs. Jacob\r\nH. Ela and Mrs. Bessie Bisbee Hunt served several years as chairmen of\r\nthe executive committee.[364] Many petitions for suffrage were\r\ncirculated and sent to the Legislature and money was raised for the\r\nNational Association. The Grange and the Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion have been valuable allies.\r\n\r\nOn June 29, 30, 1887, a convention was held in Concord and\r\narrangements made for a systematic canvass of the State.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 10, 1889, Mrs. White and other officers of the State\r\nAssociation were granted a hearing by the Constitutional Convention\r\nthen in session. They presented petitions and made a plea that the\r\nState constitution be amended so as to prohibit political\r\ndistinctions on account of sex. The special committee reported\r\n\"inexpedient to legislate\" and their report was adopted.\r\n\r\nA State meeting was held in Concord, Dec. 14, 1892, a full board of\r\nofficers was elected and it was voted to become auxiliary to the\r\nNational American Association and to remain auxiliary to the New\r\nEngland Association.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 10, 1895, the New England W. S. A. held a convention in Nashua\r\nwith Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates of Maine, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, Henry\r\nB. Blackwell and Miss Alice Stone Blackwell, editors of the _Woman's\r\nJournal_, Boston, as speakers. The day after its close the annual\r\nbusiness meeting of the New Hampshire Association was held and was\r\naddressed by Miss Blackwell. On November 8 it called a meeting at the\r\nsame place for the transaction of some special business.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 10, 1896, and on Feb. 24, 1897, the annual meetings were held\r\nin Nashua, the latter addressed by Miss Blackwell. Mrs. Marilla M.\r\nRicker, a former officer of the society but now practicing law in\r\nWashington, D.C., was candidate for U. S. Minister to Colombia, and\r\nNew Hampshire was one of six States which petitioned for her\r\nappointment. Ex-Senator Blair exerted himself in her behalf, but it is\r\nhardly necessary to say that she was not appointed.\r\n\r\nThe desire for a more effective organization had grown so strong that\r\nin November, 1900, Mrs. Susan S. Fessenden of Boston was sent into the\r\nState by the New England Association and spent two weeks, forming\r\nclubs in Concord, Newport, Littleton, Andover and North Conway, and\r\npreparing for societies in Nashua and Manchester.\r\n\r\nIn the autumn of 1901 Miss Mary N. Chase of Andover spent a month\r\norganizing local societies. A convention was called for December 16,\r\n17, in Manchester, at which ten towns were represented. The meetings\r\nwere held in the City Hall, and Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, president of\r\nthe National Association, was introduced to a fine audience the first\r\nevening by Cyrus H. Little, Speaker of the House of Representatives.\r\nAddresses were made also by Mr. and Miss Blackwell. A strong official\r\nboard was elected[365] and an effort will be made to educate public\r\nsentiment to demand a woman suffrage clause from the convention to\r\nrevise the State constitution, which is likely to be held within a\r\nshort time. On the evening of December 17 Mrs. Chapman Catt spoke in\r\nConcord, the State capital.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: The suffrage association has been\r\npetitioning the Legislature since 1870. That year it secured a law\r\nallowing women to serve on school boards. In 1878 it obtained School\r\nSuffrage for women.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 it presented a petition, signed by several thousand citizens,\r\nasking the Full Franchise for women, and was given \"leave to\r\nwithdraw.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1887 a bill conferring Municipal Suffrage and permitting women to\r\nhold all municipal offices was presented with a petition signed by\r\n2,500 citizens. A hearing was granted by the committee on July 6 and\r\n300 persons were present. On the 13th it was favorably reported in the\r\nHouse, but August 6, it was defeated by 87 ayes, 148 noes. This year\r\nthe House raised the \"age of protection\" for girls from 10 to 14 years\r\nbut the Senate amended to 13 years.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the bill for Municipal Suffrage was again introduced, sent to\r\nthe Judiciary Committee and referred to the next session as\r\n\"unfinished business.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the petitions for this bill contained 3,000 signatures, and\r\nMr. Angell of Derry also introduced a bill for suffrage for tax-paying\r\nwomen, but neither was acted upon. This experience was repeated in\r\n1893.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, after a hearing had been granted to the women, the bill was\r\nreported favorably by the Judiciary Committee and passed a second\r\nreading in the House, but a third was refused. D. C. Remick and M.\r\nLyford were earnest in their support of the measure. This year the\r\n\"age of protection\" for girls was raised to 16, but the bill was\r\nvetoed by Gov. Busiel who claimed that it was not properly framed.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy both obtain. The widow is entitled to a life\r\ninterest in one-third of the real estate and a homestead right of\r\n$500, and if she waive the provisions of the will in her favor she\r\nmay have, after the payment of debts, one-third of the personal\r\nproperty if issue survive; if not, one-half. If she waive its\r\nprovisions and release her dower and homestead right, she may have,\r\nafter all debts and expenses of administration are paid, one-third of\r\nthe real estate absolutely if issue by her survive, and, if not,\r\none-half, and the same amount of personal property. The widower is\r\nentitled to a life interest in all the wife's real estate, and a\r\nhomestead right of $500, and if he waive the provisions of her will in\r\nhis favor, the same amount of her personal property as she would\r\nreceive of his. If he release his curtesy and homestead right he is\r\nentitled to the same amount of her real estate as she would have of\r\nhis.\r\n\r\nA married woman retains control of her separate property. She can\r\nmortgage or convey it without the husband's joinder but can not bar\r\nhis curtesy of life use of the whole or his homestead right; nor can\r\nshe deprive him of these by will. The husband has the same privileges,\r\nsubject to her dower.\r\n\r\nA married woman may carry on business in her own name. She may sue and\r\nbe sued and make contracts. Her earnings are her sole and separate\r\nproperty. She can not become surety for her husband.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian but if he is insane or has given\r\ncause for divorce the court may award the minor children to the\r\nmother. The judge of probate may appoint a guardian, when necessary,\r\nto have care of the persons and property of minor children, and it may\r\nbe either the father or mother.\r\n\r\nIf the husband refuse to provide for his family he may be prosecuted\r\nin criminal form. If he is insane or has given cause for divorce the\r\ncourt may award support out of his property.\r\n\r\nThe common law making 12 years the legal age for a girl to marry has\r\nbeen retained by special statute.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls is 13 years with a penalty of\r\nimprisonment not exceeding thirty years, but no minimum punishment\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Since 1878 women, possessing the same qualifications\r\nrequired of men, that is, residence in the district three months\r\npreceding the election, are entitled to vote for members of the school\r\nboard and for appropriations of money. There are no county\r\nsuperintendents, and the State Superintendent of Instruction is\r\nappointed by the Governor and Council. The city ordinances of\r\nManchester, Franklin and Nashua prohibit women from this suffrage, but\r\nthey may vote in Concord, the capital.\r\n\r\nNew Hampshire was the first State in New England to give School\r\nSuffrage to women.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women are eligible to all elective or appointive\r\nSchool offices except where it is forbidden by special charters. They\r\nare not eligible to any other elective office.\r\n\r\nA number are serving on School Boards. They may sit on State Boards\r\nwhich are appointed by the Governor. They have done so only on the\r\nBoard of Charities and Corrections and on that of the State Normal\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\nThere is no law requiring women physicians in any State institutions,\r\nor police matrons in any city. One has been appointed in Manchester.\r\n\r\nWomen may act as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: On July 25, 1889, Chief Justice Charles Doe of the\r\nSupreme Court delivered the opinion that women may become members of\r\nthe bar and practice in all the courts. No occupation or profession is\r\nlegally forbidden. Ten hours are made a working day.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The old college of Dartmouth at Hanover is for men only.\r\nThe State Agricultural College at Durham admits both sexes.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 256 men and 2,714 women teachers. The\r\naverage monthly salary of the men is $69.75; of the women $40.59.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[364] Among other officers since 1884 are: Presidents, Mrs. E. J.

Warden as president. Mrs. Cornelia C. Hussey, Mrs. Katherine\r\nH. Browning, Mrs. Warden and others continued to represent the State\r\nas vice-presidents at the national conventions.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Dr. Mary D. Hussey, who had been a member of the old society,\r\ninvited a number of active suffragists to unite in forming a new State\r\nassociation. Eleven responded and, at the residence of Mrs. Charlotte\r\nN. Enslin, in Orange, February 5, a constitution was adopted, Judge\r\nJohn Whitehead elected president and Dr. Hussey secretary and\r\ntreasurer.[367]\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the Rev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell became president; Mrs.\r\nAmelia Dickinson Pope was elected in 1892; and in 1893 Mrs. Florence\r\nHowe Hall, daughter of Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, accepted the presidency.\r\n\r\nThe first public meeting of the association was held at Orange, March\r\n4, 1893, where Mrs. Clara C. Hoffman of Missouri, gave an address. The\r\nfirst auxiliary society formed was that of Essex County, with forty\r\nmembers, Mrs. Jennie D. De Witt, president. Five other State meetings\r\nwere held and the membership trebled. Among the lecturers were Aaron\r\nM. Powell, Mrs. Blackwell, Mrs. S. M. Perkins of Ohio, and the\r\npresident. A number of clergymen gave sermons on suffrage, 14,000\r\npages of literature were circulated in seventeen of the twenty-one\r\ncounties, and the _Woman's Column_ was sent to 200 persons at the\r\nexpense of Mrs. Cornelia C. Hussey. The women's vote at school\r\nmeetings greatly increased and a number were elected trustees. The\r\nannual convention was held at Newark in November.\r\n\r\nThe constitutional amendment campaign in the neighboring State of New\r\nYork had a very favorable effect on public opinion in New Jersey\r\nduring 1894. In addition to the usual meetings a memorial service in\r\nhonor of Lucy Stone was held in Peddie Memorial Church, Newark, one of\r\nthe largest churches in the State, with more than 2,000 people\r\npresent, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore being the chief speaker. Another\r\nmeeting was held in Orange, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe making the principal\r\naddress.\r\n\r\nA sunflower lunch was given to raise funds for the campaign in Kansas\r\nand $200 were sent, of which half was contributed by Mrs. Hussey.\r\nAmong the vast amount of literature circulated were 1,000 copies of\r\nsuffrage papers. The State convention was held as usual in Newark,\r\nNovember 24. This year the Populist party declared for woman suffrage\r\nin its State convention. The Knights of Labor also have indorsed it.\r\n\r\nIn 1895, before entering upon the three years' campaign for the\r\nrestoration of School Suffrage, which had been declared\r\nunconstitutional the previous year, the association presented to the\r\nLegislature petitions signed by about 1,000 persons, asking for the\r\nrestoration of full suffrage to the women of New Jersey, which had\r\nbeen taken away in 1807. This was done not with any expectation of\r\nsuccess but in order to place the association on record as having\r\ndemanded this right. In the new measure for School Suffrage they\r\nbegged that it might include the women of towns and cities instead of\r\nmerely country districts, according to the law of 1887, but this was\r\nrefused.\r\n\r\nMrs. Anna B. S. Pond arranged a course of lectures for the benefit of\r\nthe School Suffrage fund and, with a souvenir, $100 were raised. A\r\nhandsome suffrage flag was presented to the association by Miss Martha\r\nB. Haines, recording secretary.\r\n\r\nFour meetings of the State association were held in Newark, and one in\r\nPlainfield during the year, and lectures were given by Mrs. Lillie\r\nDevereux Blake of New York, Mrs. Annie L. Diggs of Kansas, Miss\r\nElizabeth Upham Yates of Maine, and Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman\r\nof the national organization committee. The fifth convention assembled\r\nin the chapel of Trinity (Episcopal) Church, Elizabeth, November 29.\r\nMrs. Ella B. Carter, chairman on press work, stated that many leading\r\npapers were advocating the restoring of School Suffrage. Mrs. Harriet\r\nL. Coolidge, chairman of the School Suffrage Committee, reported that\r\nabout fifty women had held the office of trustee since 1873, when this\r\nright was given, that twelve more were still serving despite the\r\nSupreme Court decision, and that women had voted in school meetings in\r\nalmost every county.\r\n\r\nThe School Suffrage Resolution passed the Legislature, but as it had\r\nto be approved by two successive Legislatures before it could be\r\nsubmitted to the voters, it was necessary to agitate the subject so\r\nthe law-makers might see that the people really desired the passage of\r\nthis measure, and the winter of 1896 was devoted to this purpose. A\r\nnew circular setting forth the success it had previously been was\r\ncirculated in connection with the petition. As the president was\r\nunable to attend the session of the Legislature, Miss Mary Philbrook,\r\nchairman of the Committee on Laws, took charge of the measure, which\r\nin March was passed for the second time without opposition. It was\r\ndecided, however, to have certain other proposed amendments to the\r\nconstitution altered, and that for School Suffrage was kept back with\r\nthe others, as the constitution can be amended only once in five\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nIn the spring circulars were sent to 300 newspapers to be published,\r\nurging women to attend school meetings and to exercise the scrap of\r\nfranchise still left to them--a vote on appropriations.[368] New\r\nJersey sent $150 to the National Association and $50 to California for\r\nits campaign this year, in addition to the money spent on State work.\r\nThe annual meeting was held in Orange, Nov. 27, 1896. A vote of thanks\r\nwas tendered Miss Jane Campbell of Philadelphia for her generous gift\r\nof 300 copies of \"Woman's Progress\" containing an account of suffrage\r\nin New Jersey by Mrs. Hall.\r\n\r\nThe signatures to the petition were increased to over 7,000 in 1897,\r\nand the Legislature passed the resolution for the School Suffrage\r\nAmendment for the third time, in March. The association at once began\r\nactive work to influence the voters. Meetings were held in halls,\r\nchurches and parlors in all parts of the State and many articles were\r\npublished explaining the scope of the amendment. The State Federation\r\nof Women's Clubs, the Granges, Working Girls' Societies, Daughters of\r\nLiberty, the Ladies of the G. A. R., the Junior Order of American\r\nMechanics and other organizations gave cordial indorsement. Mrs. Hall\r\ndelivered three addresses on this subject before the State Federation\r\nof Clubs; Mrs. Emily E. Williamson, afterwards its president, also\r\nmade a strong speech, urging the members to work for the amendment,\r\nand paid for 5,000 of the Appeals which were sent out. The W. C. T. U.\r\nrendered every possible assistance in securing signers for the\r\npetitions and educating public sentiment.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer an extensive correspondence was carried on with\r\nprominent people including the State board of education, State, county\r\nand city superintendents of public instruction, etc. They were asked\r\nto sign An Appeal to the Friends of Education which clearly set forth\r\nthe advantages of the proposed amendment. Having obtained the one\r\nhundred influential signatures desired the document was widely\r\ndistributed to the press. Copies were sent to many organizations of\r\nmen and women, and also to the clergy, with the request that they\r\nwould use their influence with their congregations. A number did so,\r\nbut probably many were afraid to speak on this subject lest they\r\ninjure the chances of the Anti-Gambling Amendment to the constitution,\r\nwhich was to be voted on at the same time. The school authorities\r\nstrongly indorsed the amendment and related the benefit which School\r\nSuffrage for women had been within their experience. Extracts from\r\nthese letters, including one from the State Superintendent of Public\r\nInstruction, the Hon. Charles J. Baxter, thanking the association for\r\nwork in its behalf, were widely published.\r\n\r\nThe Republican State Executive Committee and some county committees\r\nindorsed the amendment. Efforts were made to have it presented at the\r\nmany meetings which were held in behalf of the Anti-Race Track\r\nAmendment, but they were not always successful. Through an unavoidable\r\ncircumstance the press work fell principally on the president. The\r\ncorresponding secretary, Dr. Hussey, gave an immense amount of labor,\r\ndevoting the whole summer to the work of the campaign. Mrs. Angell\r\nrendered most efficient service, a part of it the sending of a letter\r\nto nearly every minister in the State. Mrs. L. H. Rowan was chairman\r\nof the finance committee but so sure were the friends of success that\r\nonly $150 were expended.\r\n\r\nThe special election was held Sept. 28, 1897, and the result was a\r\ngreat disappointment. The School Suffrage Amendment, to which it was\r\ngenerally supposed there would be practically no opposition, was\r\ndefeated--65,021 ayes, 75,170 noes. The adverse vote came almost\r\nentirely from the cities where the actual experiment never had been\r\nmade. The country districts, where women had exercised School\r\nSuffrage, understood its workings and voted for the amendment. The\r\nGermans in particular opposed it, and it was said that they and many\r\nother voters understood it to give complete suffrage to women. As it\r\nwas printed in full on the ballot itself, the carelessness and\r\nindifference of the average voter were thus made painfully apparent.\r\n\r\nThe labor was not altogether wasted, however, as through it the people\r\nwere brought to understand that women still had a partial vote at\r\nschool meetings. (See Suffrage.) For instance the women of Cranford,\r\nwhere a new schoolhouse was badly needed, were told by their town\r\ncounsel that they had lost the ballot, but the president of the\r\nsuffrage association informed them of the error of this learned\r\ngentleman, and they came out and voted, the campaign being conducted\r\nby the Village Improvement Association, a club composed of women. The\r\nmajority in favor of the new schoolhouse was only seven. The\r\nopposition called a second meeting and reversed this decision. The\r\nwomen circulated petitions and compelled the school board to call a\r\nthird meeting where they won the day. It was voted to erect one new\r\nbuilding to cost $24,700 and another on the south side to cost nearly\r\n$11,000.\r\n\r\nThis same year, in South Orange, two unsuccessful attempts were made\r\nto get an appropriation to build a much-needed High School. The men\r\nfinally decided to call upon the women for help. Nearly 500 attended\r\nthe meeting, and the $25,000 appropriation was carried by an\r\noverwhelming majority. The school at Westfield and two new High School\r\nbuildings at Asbury Park and Atlantic Highlands were built because of\r\nthe women's vote. Manual training was introduced into the Vineland\r\nschools through the zeal of women. A report from Moorestown says: \"The\r\nyear that women first began to vote at school meetings marks a decided\r\nrevival of intelligent interest in our public schools.\" In Scotch\r\nPlains, where the meetings were held in the public school building, a\r\nholiday afterwards had always been necessary in order to clean it.\r\nWith the advent of the feminine voters, expectoration and peanut\r\nshells ceased to decorate the floors, and the children were able to\r\nattend school the next day as usual. The Women's Educational\r\nAssociation introduced manual training into the public schools of East\r\nOrange.[369]\r\n\r\nA number of meetings of the State association were held during 1897,\r\nand among the speakers were Mrs. Mary C. C. Bradford and Mrs. Ellis\r\nMeredith of Colorado, Mrs. Celia B. Whitehead and Miss Laura E.\r\nHolmes. The annual convention took place at Wissner Hall, Newark,\r\nNovember 30.\r\n\r\nThree State meetings were held in 1898, the conference of the National\r\nBoard co-operating with the State association, taking the place of the\r\nconvention. This was held May 6, 7, at Orange, and was the strong\r\nfeature of the year. Through the efforts of the local committee, Mrs.\r\nMinola Graham Sexton, chairman, a large attendance was secured. Among\r\nthe speakers were the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, vice-president-at-large\r\nof the National Association, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, Mrs. Mariana W.\r\nChapman, president of the New York State Association, and a number of\r\nState women. New Jersey contributed this year $648 to the Organization\r\nCommittee of the National, most of which went to the Oklahoma\r\ncampaign. The largest contributions were from Mrs. Cornelia C. Hussey,\r\n$450; Moorestown League (Miss S. W. Lippincott) $50; collections at\r\nOrange, $41; Essex County, $40; Mrs. A. Van Winkle, $20.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting was held at Camden, Nov. 29, 1898. Mrs. Rachel\r\nFoster Avery, corresponding secretary of the National Association, and\r\nMiss Jane Campbell, president of the Philadelphia county association,\r\nwere the afternoon speakers, Mrs. Bradford making the principal\r\naddress of the evening. The New Jersey Legal Aid Association was\r\nformed this year in Newark, Dr. Hussey taking an active part. The\r\nfirst president was Miss Cecilia Gaines, who was succeeded by Mrs.\r\nStewart Hartshorn. Its object is to give legal assistance to those\r\nunable to pay for it, and especially to women. All its officers are\r\nwomen, and a woman attorney is employed. Up to the present time (1901)\r\nit has had applications from 700 persons.\r\n\r\nTwo meetings of the State Association were held in 1899. A\r\ncontribution of $220 was made to the National Organization Committee.\r\nAt the annual meeting, held November 28, at Jersey City, Major Z. K.\r\nPangborn, editor of the _Journal_, made an address at the evening\r\nsession. The principal speaker was Mrs. Percy Widdrington of London,\r\nwho gave an account of woman suffrage and its good practical results\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nResolutions of deep regret for the death of Aaron M. Powell, editor of\r\n_The Philanthropist_, were adopted.\r\n\r\nThe State Association held two meetings during 1900, and did a great\r\ndeal of work in preparation for the National Suffrage Bazar. Dr.\r\nHussey was made chairman of the Bazar Committee, while Mrs. Sexton\r\narranged the ten musical entertainments which were given during the\r\nBazar. The tenth annual convention was held at Moorestown, November\r\n13, 14. There was a large attendance, including many men. The new\r\nnational president, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, was the principal\r\nspeaker. Others were Mrs. Lucretia L. Blankenburg, president of the\r\nPennsylvania Association; Mrs. Mary V. Grice, president of the State\r\nCongress of Mothers; Mrs. Catharine B. Lippincott, representing the\r\nGrange, and Mrs. Hall, who spoke on the American Woman in the American\r\nHome.\r\n\r\nMrs. Hall, who had been president during the whole period of active\r\nlife of the association, declined re-election. She did so with the\r\ngreatest reluctance, but felt that the increasing pressure of work\r\nmade it important that some one with more leisure at her disposal\r\nshould fill the office. Mrs. Sexton was elected president.[370]\r\n\r\nMrs. Cornelia C. Hussey is the largest contributor in New Jersey to\r\nthe suffrage cause in general. Since many of her donations have been\r\nmade to the National Association directly, not passing through the\r\nhands of the State treasurer, they can not be computed here, nor does\r\nshe herself know their full amount. She has given also most liberally\r\nto State work and her contributions run well up into the thousands. A\r\nnumber of New Jersey women have been made life members of the National\r\nAssociation by her. She is a member of its organization\r\ncommittee.[371]\r\n\r\nIn early days Mrs. Theresa Walling Seabrook stood almost alone in the\r\nW. C. T. U. in her advocacy of woman suffrage and it required ten\r\nyears of effort to secure a franchise department, of which she was\r\nmade the first superintendent. For many years, however, this\r\norganization has been an active and helpful force and undoubtedly has\r\nmade numerous converts, besides securing valuable legislation. The\r\nGrange has been always a faithful ally of the woman suffrage cause.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: On Feb. 13, 1884, a special committee of\r\nthe Assembly granted a hearing on the petition of Mrs. Celia B.\r\nWhitehead and 220 others, asking the restoration of the right of Full\r\nSuffrage which had been unconstitutionally taken away from women in\r\n1807. (See Suffrage.) Henry B. Blackwell and the Rev. Phoebe A.\r\nHanaford of Massachusetts and Mrs. Theresa Walling Seabrook presented\r\nthe question. They asked also for School Suffrage. The committee\r\nreported favorably on both measures. The former reached a vote and was\r\ndefeated by 24 yeas, 27 nays.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Dr. William M. Baird, Speaker of the Assembly, had a bill\r\nintroduced conferring School Suffrage on women in villages and country\r\ndistricts, and advocated it from the floor. It passed unanimously,\r\nMarch 23, not on its merits but because the Speaker wanted it. It was\r\npassed by the Senate March 31, by 15 yeas, 2 nays, and signed April 8,\r\nby Gov. Robert S. Green.\r\n\r\nThis year Aaron M. Powell and the Rev. A. H. Lewis secured a law\r\nraising the \"age of protection\" for girls from 10 to 16.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the courts decided that the law granting School Suffrage to\r\nwomen was unconstitutional and that an amendment to the constitution\r\nwould be necessary to enable them to exercise it. The suffrage\r\nassociation immediately took steps to secure a resolution submitting\r\nthis amendment to the electors, as previously described. In 1895 it\r\nwas introduced in the Senate by Foster M. Voorhees (now Governor) and\r\npassed in June by 13 yeas, 2 nays. It passed the Assembly by 36 yeas,\r\none nay. It had to be acted upon by two Legislatures. In March, 1896,\r\nit passed the Senate unanimously; and the Assembly by 57 yeas, one\r\nnay. A technicality required it to pass the third Legislature, which\r\nit did in March, 1897--Senate, 15 yeas, 1 nay; Assembly, 42 yeas, 5\r\nnays.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1894, it was enacted that women might be notaries.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1895, a bill was secured making women eligible to\r\nappointment as Commissioners of Deeds, after having failed in 1891,\r\n'92 and '94, and Miss Mary M. Steele was appointed.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Miss Mary Philbrook, an attorney, with the help of the\r\nsuffrage officials, secured a bill making women eligible as Masters in\r\nChancery and was herself the first one appointed.\r\n\r\nThis year the State Teachers' Association secured a law permitting a\r\nTeachers' Retirement Fund to be created, which, with some amendments\r\nin 1899, enables a teacher after twenty years' service, if\r\nincapacitated for further work, to receive from $250 to $600 per\r\nannum. Some improvement also was made in the property laws for women.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1898, through the efforts of the Federation of Women's\r\nClubs, a law was passed and an appropriation made for State Traveling\r\nLibraries.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy obtain. The widow is entitled to a life use of\r\none-third of the real estate and, if there is a child or children, to\r\none-third of the personal property absolutely; if there are no\r\nchildren, to one-half of it. The remainder of the real and personal\r\nestate goes to the husband's kindred. \"The widow may remain in the\r\nmansion house of her husband free of rent until dower is assigned.\"\r\nThe widower is entitled to the life use of all the wife's real estate,\r\nand if there is no will, to all her personal property without\r\nadministration. She may, however, dispose of all of it by will as she\r\npleases. She can not by will deprive the husband of his curtesy in\r\nreal estate, except by order of the Court of Chancery when she is\r\nliving separate from him. She can not encumber or dispose of her\r\nseparate estate without his joinder. He can mortgage or convey his\r\nreal estate without her joinder but it is subject to her dower. Her\r\nseparate property is liable for her debts but not for those of her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nSince 1895 a married woman may contract as if unmarried, and sue and\r\nbe sued in her own name as to property, but for personal injuries the\r\nhusband must join. She can not become surety.\r\n\r\nSince 1896 she may carry on business in her own name, her earnings and\r\nwages are her separate property, and her deposits in savings banks are\r\nfree from the control of her husband.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the persons and estates of minor\r\nchildren. At his death the mother becomes guardian. In case of\r\nseparation with no misconduct on the part of either, the mother has\r\nthe preference until the child is seven years old, after which the\r\nrights are equal. Provision is made for the access of the mother to\r\ninfant children. On the death of the one to whom the child is assigned\r\nit is subject to the order of the court.\r\n\r\nThe husband must furnish such support as will maintain the wife in the\r\nposition in which he has placed her by marriage. If he refuse he must\r\ngive bonds or go to jail. The wife must contribute to the support of\r\nthe family if the husband is unable.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 16 years in\r\n1887. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $1,000 or imprisonment at\r\nhard labor not exceeding fifteen years, or both. No minimum penalty is\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nNo girl under fourteen shall be employed in a factory, and no children\r\nunder fourteen shall be employed in any workshop or factory over ten\r\nhours a day or sixty hours a week. The failure of employers to\r\nprovide seats for female employes beside a work bench or counter shall\r\nbe punished as a misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: New Jersey is the first State in which a woman ever cast a\r\nballot. The constitution adopted July 2, 1776, conferred the franchise\r\non \"all inhabitants worth $250, etc.\" In 1790 a revision of the\r\nelection law used the words \"he or she,\" thus giving legislative\r\nsanction to a construction of the constitution which placed women in\r\nthe electorate. While the records show that women did vote for various\r\nofficers, including President of the United States and members of the\r\nLegislature, yet in those days of almost absolute male supremacy, when\r\nit was not customary for women to own even $250 worth of property and\r\nall they possessed became the husband's at marriage, it is not to be\r\nsupposed that very many could avail themselves of the privilege.\r\nEnough did so, however, to make them a factor in the fierce political\r\ncontentions which soon arose, and to gain the enmity of politicians.\r\nIn 1807 the Legislature passed an arbitrary act limiting the suffrage\r\nto \"white male citizens.\" This was clearly a usurpation of authority,\r\nas the constitution could be changed only by action of the voters.\r\nNevertheless, men were in power and women were no longer permitted to\r\nexercise the franchise.\r\n\r\nIn 1844 a convention framed a new constitution in which the suffrage\r\nwas restricted to \"white males,\" and only men were allowed to vote on\r\nits adoption. Women were still electors according to the existing\r\nconstitution, and yet they were not permitted to vote for delegates to\r\nthis convention nor for the ratification of the new constitution. No\r\nSupreme Court could have rendered any other decision than that this\r\nwas illegally adopted.\r\n\r\nFor exactly eighty years women were deprived of any franchise. During\r\nthe last twenty of this period they made repeated efforts to vote and\r\npresented numerous petitions to the Legislature to have their ancient\r\nright restored. In 1887 this body enacted that women might vote at\r\nschool meetings (i. e. in villages and country districts) for\r\ntrustees, bonds, appropriations, etc.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 a law was enacted giving the right to vote for Road\r\nCommissioner to \"all freeholders.\" An election was very soon contested\r\nat Englewood, and in June, 1894, the Supreme Court decided that the\r\nact was illegal because \"it is not competent for the Legislature to\r\nenlarge or diminish the class of voters comprehended within the\r\nconstitutional definition.\" [The court had forgotten about that\r\nLegislature of 1807.]\r\n\r\nThis gave the opportunity for those who were opposed to women's\r\nexercising the School Suffrage. At a special election for school\r\ntrustees held in Vineland, July 27, 1894, the women were forcibly\r\nprevented from depositing their ballots. The State Superintendent of\r\nPublic Instruction was appealed to and he directed the county\r\nsuperintendent to appoint a board of trustees, as the election from\r\nwhich the women were excluded was illegal. This was done on the advice\r\nof the Attorney-General, who held that the constitution by empowering\r\nthe Legislature to \"provide for the maintenance and support of a\r\nsystem of free public schools,\" gave it the power to confer on women\r\nthe right to vote at school meetings for school officers.\r\n\r\nWithout following the details it is only necessary to relate that the\r\nSupreme Court declared that \"the State constitution says, 'Every male\r\ncitizen, etc., shall be entitled to vote for all officers that are now\r\nor may be hereafter elective by the people' (!) and school trustees\r\nare elective officers within this provision, therefore the Act\r\nallowing women to vote for them is unconstitutional.\"\r\n\r\nWomen had been voting for these officers seven years under this Act,\r\nand always for the benefit of the schools, according to the almost\r\nuniversal testimony of educational authorities. It now became\r\nnecessary, in order to continue this privilege, to obtain an amendment\r\nto the constitution. The story of the three years' effort made by the\r\nState Suffrage Association for this purpose is related earlier in the\r\nchapter. Since this had to be made they begged that the amendment\r\nmight include School Suffrage for the women in towns and cities also,\r\nbut this was refused. And yet even a proposition to restore School\r\nSuffrage to those of villages and rural districts, when submitted to\r\nthe voters, was defeated at the election on Sept. 28, 1897, by 65,029\r\nyeas, 75,170 nays, over 10,000 majority.\r\n\r\nWhile the Supreme Court decision took away the vote for trustees it\r\ndid not interfere with the right of women in villages and country\r\ndistricts to vote on questions of bonds and appropriations for the\r\nbuilding of schoolhouses and other school purposes, and that is the\r\namount of suffrage now possessed by women in New Jersey. When the\r\nschool laws were revised in 1900 this fragment was carefully guarded\r\nand provision made for furnishing two boxes, one in which the men\r\nmight put their vote on all school matters, and the other where women\r\nmight put theirs on the ones above specified.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: In 1873 a law was passed that \"no person hereafter\r\nshall be eligible to the office of school trustee unless he or she can\r\nread and write,\" and women were authorized to serve when duly elected.\r\nIn 1894, when the School Suffrage was taken away by the Supreme Court,\r\nthirty-two were holding the office and the decision did not abrogate\r\nthis right. They have continued to be elected and twenty-seven are\r\nserving at the present time. At Englewood, in 1899, Miss Adaline\r\nSterling was president of the board. Women are not eligible as State\r\nor county superintendents.\r\n\r\nFour of the nine trustees of the State Industrial School for Girls are\r\nwomen, and a woman physician is employed when one is needed.\r\n\r\nDr. Mary J. Dunlop has been superintendent and medical director of the\r\nState Institution for Feeble-Minded Women since 1886, and three of the\r\nseven managers are women.\r\n\r\nThere are no women physicians in any other State institution and no\r\nlaw requiring them. In most of the hospitals there are training\r\nschools for nurses with women superintendents.\r\n\r\nThe State Board of Children's Guardians has a woman chairman of the\r\nexecutive committee, and a woman attorney.\r\n\r\nThe State Charities Aid Association has seven women on the Board of\r\nManagers, including the general secretary. Women sit on the boards of\r\nthe State School for Deaf Mutes, the Home for Waifs and those of some\r\ncounty asylums. Most of the almshouses have matrons in the female\r\ndepartment but there are no women on the boards of management.\r\n\r\nA matron and three assistants are in charge of the women in the\r\npenitentiary and there is a matron at the jails of most cities. In\r\nsome of them police matrons have been appointed, but no law requires\r\nthis.\r\n\r\nIn the State Hospital at Trenton over eighty women are employed,\r\nincluding four supervisors, a librarian, stenographers, nurses, etc.\r\n\r\nIn the State Home for Boys there are over twenty women, including\r\nprincipal of school, teachers, matrons, typewriters, etc.\r\n\r\nThere are women on a number of Public Library Boards, and one, at\r\nleast, acts as treasurer. The head librarian and all the assistants of\r\nthe Plainfield public library are women. Sixty of the ninety-nine\r\npublic libraries in the State employ women librarians, and five are\r\nserved by volunteers. Most of the assistants in all cities are women.\r\n\r\nWomen act as masters in chancery, commissioners of deeds and notaries\r\npublic, and one at least has served as district clerk.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen. Admission to the bar having been denied to Miss Mary Philbrook,\r\nin 1894, solely on account of her sex, she requested a hearing before\r\nthe Judiciary Committee of the Legislature of 1895, which was\r\naddressed by Mrs. Florence Howe Hall, president of the State Suffrage\r\nAssociation, Mrs. Carrie Burnham Kilgore, a lawyer of Philadelphia,\r\nand Miss Philbrook herself. Soon afterward a law was enacted making\r\nwomen eligible to examination for admission to the bar, which, in\r\nJune, was passed successfully by Miss Philbrook, who thus became the\r\nfirst woman lawyer. There are now eight. In 1899, Miss Mary G. Potter\r\nof the New York Bar, Miss Philbrook of the New Jersey Bar, and Dr.\r\nMary D. Hussey of the New York University Law School, called a meeting\r\nof women attorneys at East Orange. A committee was appointed which\r\norganized the Women Lawyers' Club in New York, on June 24, with\r\nmembers in both States.\r\n\r\nThere are about one hundred women physicians in the State,\r\nseventy-five allopathic and the rest belonging to other schools. They\r\nare members of most of the county medical societies, which makes them\r\nmembers of the State Medical Society. Dr. Sarah F. Mackintosh was the\r\nfirst woman admitted to a county society (Passaic) in 1871. Dr.\r\nFrances S. Janney was elected president of the Burlington County\r\nMedical Society in 1900, the first to receive such an honor. The first\r\nmeeting of women physicians took place in Atlantic City, June, 1900,\r\nwhen those of the State gave a reception to those from other States\r\nwho were attending the convention of the American Medical Association.\r\nThe Medical Club of Newark, the first organization of women\r\nphysicians, was formed the next November, with seventeen charter\r\nmembers from Newark and its vicinity, Dr. Katherine Porter of Orange,\r\npresident.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Princeton University is closed to women, and so are\r\nPrinceton Theological Seminary (Presb.), Drew Theological Seminary\r\n(Meth. Epis.) and Rutgers College (Dutch Reformed). There is no\r\ncollege for women in New Jersey. The State Normal School is\r\nco-educational.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 833 men and 5,806 women teachers. The\r\naverage monthly salary of the men is $86.21; of the women $48.12. In\r\nPlainfield the principals of all the public schools, except the High\r\nSchool, are women. This is due to the fact that the city\r\nsuperintendent from 1881 to 1892 was a woman, Miss Julia Buckley\r\n(afterwards dean of the woman's department of Chicago University), and\r\nthe custom established by her has been continued.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nNew Jersey has so many associations of women that they have acted as a\r\nbar against the formation of suffrage clubs, women feeling that they\r\nhad already too many meetings to attend. The State Federation of\r\nWomen's Clubs has been an active and progressive force. It secured\r\nState Traveling Libraries; and if the Palisades are preserved from\r\ndestruction, as now seems likely, this will be due to its earnest\r\nefforts. It was influential, in 1899, in having the kindergarten made\r\na part of the public school system. It also has a town improvement\r\ndepartment, with numerous branches. Several of its auxiliary clubs\r\nhave founded public libraries, and some of them have conducted\r\ncampaigns to put women on the school board. Other clubs have supported\r\nkindergartens and arranged free lectures for the public.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[366] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Florence Howe\r\nHall of Plainfield, president of the State Woman Suffrage Association\r\nfor the past eight years, and to Dr. Mary D. Hussey of East Orange,\r\nits founder and corresponding secretary.\r\n\r\n[367] The others present were Mesdames Phebe C. Wright, Alice C.\r\nAngell, Sarah A. McClees, Caroline Ross Graham, Katherine H. Browning,\r\nAnna M. Warden, Mrs. Minola Graham Sexton, Mrs. Emma L. Blackwell.\r\n\r\n[368] The sending of this yearly circular to the press, shortly before\r\nthe time of the annual school meeting, has been continued under the\r\nspecial charge of the president.\r\n\r\n[369] East Orange also had from 1894 to 1900 a school committee\r\nconsisting of ten women elected every year at the annual school\r\nmeeting--a sort of auxiliary association which did good work. In 1900\r\nit became a city, and the school officers are now elected at the polls\r\nwhere women can not vote.\r\n\r\n[370] The remaining officers elected were: Vice-president, Mrs. W. J.\r\nPullen; corresponding secretary, Dr. Mary D. Hussey; recording\r\nsecretary, Miss J. H. Morris; treasurer, Mrs. Anna B. Jeffery;\r\nauditor, Mrs. Mary C. Bassett.\r\n\r\nThe other officers who have served during the past ten years are:\r\nVice-presidents, Mrs. Katherine H. Browning, Mrs. Margaret C.\r\nCampfield, Rev.

Louise Watts.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LV.\r\n\r\nNEW MEXICO.[372]\r\n\r\n\r\nAt the Constitutional Convention held in 1888 an effort was made to\r\nsecure equal political rights for women, but it received little\r\nsupport. In September, 1893, Mrs. E. M. Marble visited Albuquerque and\r\norganized a suffrage club with Mrs. G. W. Granger as president. In\r\nDecember, 1895, Mrs. Laura M. Johns, president of the Kansas E. S. A.\r\nand national organizer, spent a few days in New Mexico, on the way to\r\nand from Arizona, and formed several clubs.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Mrs. Julia B. Nelson, president of the Minnesota W. S. A.,\r\nbegan work in the Territory under the auspices of the National\r\nAssociation, her first address being delivered at Raton, April 1, and\r\nher last May 12, at the same place. Her mission was to discover the\r\nsuffragists, make converts, arrange for a Territorial convention and\r\neffect an organization auxiliary to the national.[373] As a result a\r\nconvention was held at Albuquerque, April 28, 29, conducted by Mrs.\r\nJohns and Mrs. Nelson. A Territorial association was formed and the\r\nfollowing officers were elected: President, Mrs. J. D. Perkins;\r\ncorresponding secretary, Mrs. Alice P. Hadley; recording secretary,\r\nMiss Clara Cummings; treasurer, Mrs. Martha C. Raynolds.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 and 1898 no conventions were held, on account of the absence\r\nof several of the officers from the Territory. Through the efforts of\r\nMrs. Hadley (herself prevented by physical infirmity), H. B.\r\nFergusson, delegate to Congress for New Mexico, represented the\r\nTerritory and made a speech in the convention of the National\r\nAssociation at Washington in 1898.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1899, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the national\r\norganization committee, and Miss Mary G. Hay, secretary, spent one day\r\nin Santa Fé with George H. and Mrs. Catherine P. Wallace. Mr. Wallace\r\nwas secretary of the Territory, and in their home, the historic old\r\nPalacio, forty people gathered to hear Mrs. Chapman Catt lecture. She\r\nmade an hour's address, after which there was an interesting\r\ndiscussion. As a result, a meeting was called for December 19, and the\r\nTerritorial association was reorganized with the following officers:\r\nPresident, Mrs. Wallace; vice-president, Mrs. Hadley; corresponding\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Esther B. Thomas; recording secretary, Mrs. Anna Van\r\nSchick; treasurer, Miss Mary Morrison; member national executive\r\ncommittee, Mrs. Ellen J. Palen. Several vice-presidents were named and\r\ntwenty-five members enrolled.[374]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: On Feb. 10, 1893, a bill was passed in\r\nthe Lower House declaring the right of female citizens to vote at\r\nelections and hold offices relating to public schools and public\r\neducation. It was not acted upon by the Senate. In 1895 this bill was\r\ndefeated.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 a bill was introduced by Representative McIntosh of San Juan\r\nCounty (near the Colorado line), on request of his constituents, for\r\nthe extension of School Suffrage to women. This received the favorable\r\nvotes of one-third of the Lower House, but did not reach the Senate.\r\n\r\nA law was passed April 2, 1884, defining the rights of the married\r\nwoman. It secured to her the control of property owned by her at the\r\ntime of marriage and of wages earned afterward, made her not liable\r\nfor her husband's debts and gave her the same power to make contracts,\r\nwills, etc., as was possessed by him. The law at present is as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Curtesy still obtains. One-half of the community property goes to\r\n     the wife whether the husband dies testate or intestate. In\r\n     addition to this she is entitled to one-fourth of the rest of his\r\n     estate, \"provided this deduction shall only be made when said\r\n     property amounts to $5,000, and the heirs be not descendants;\r\n     although it may exceed this sum in the absence of the latter.\r\n     Also from the property of the wife the fourth shall be deducted\r\n     as the marital right of the husband, and upon the same\r\n     conditions, should the husband without this aid remain poor.\" If\r\n     there are no legitimate children surviving, the widow or widower\r\n     shall be heir to all the acquired property of the marriage\r\n     community.\r\n\r\nBy act of 1897, a mortgage not executed by the wife shall in no wise\r\naffect the homestead rights of the wife or family.\r\n\r\nBy act of 1899: \"The signature or consent of the wife shall not be\r\nnecessary or requisite in any conveyance, incumbrance or alienation of\r\nreal property owned by the husband, whether such property became his\r\nbefore or during coverture; but the right to make such conveyance or\r\ncreate such incumbrance shall exist in the husband to the same extent\r\nas though he were unmarried.\"[375]\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the minor children.\r\n\r\nThe husband is not required by law to support the family.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 14\r\nyears, with penalty of imprisonment not less than five nor more than\r\ntwenty years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women have no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: In 1899 a bill passed for appropriations, etc., for\r\nthe Deaf and Dumb Asylum recommended the appointment of two women on\r\nthe Board of (five) Trustees. The appointments were duly made and\r\nconfirmed.\r\n\r\nWomen serve as members of county school examining boards.\r\n\r\nThe new office of supervising teacher of the Government Indian Pueblo\r\nSchools has been filled by Miss Mary E. Dissett.\r\n\r\nWomen are special masters in court, notaries public, court and\r\nlegislative stenographers in Spanish and English and census\r\nenumerators. In the last two administrations a woman has acted as\r\nprivate secretary to the Governor.\r\n\r\nA woman has been appointed commissioner for New Mexico to take\r\ntestimony in Indian depredation claims.\r\n\r\nAt a Territorial Irrigation Convention, in 1900, one woman was a duly\r\nelected delegate, taking part in the discussions, etc.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: All professions and occupations are open to women. They\r\nconduct ranches and engage in mining. In Santa Fé the Woman's Board of\r\nTrade, an incorporated body, has so ably conducted the work for\r\ncharities and for civic improvements as to arouse a sentiment that\r\nwomen might well be intrusted with educational and more extended\r\nmunicipal affairs. In Las Cruces an organization of women is doing a\r\nsimilar work.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All educational institutions are open to both sexes, and\r\ndegrees are conferred alike upon men and women. The Territorial\r\nUniversity at Albuquerque, the Las Vegas Normal University and others\r\nhave women on their faculties.\r\n\r\nAt the meeting of the Territorial Educational Association in December,\r\n1899, a council was formed composed of twenty-five members, both women\r\nand men. At its first meeting, in September, 1900, a resolution in\r\nfavor of School Suffrage for women was unanimously adopted.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are (approximately) 390 men and 316 women\r\nteachers. The average salaries are not obtainable.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe call to arms for the Spanish-American War brought men to the\r\ndifferent recruiting posts in New Mexico, but no provision for them\r\nhad been made by the government. The women of Santa Fé, Albuquerque,\r\nLas Cruces, Las Vegas and other towns quickly organized Soldiers' Aid\r\nSocieties and raised funds to feed and care for them, till the\r\ncompanies were mustered in and came under Uncle Sam's charge.\r\n\r\nAt the Territorial Democratic Convention in Albuquerque, April, 1900,\r\nthe following was included in the platform: \"It is our belief that\r\nwomen should be granted an equal voice and position with men in all\r\nmatters pertaining to our public schools.\"\r\n\r\nThe native Spanish-Americans have great reverence for their elders.\r\nAmong a few of the old Don families where the eldest member living is\r\na senora, so greatly are her wishes and opinions respected that the\r\nentire community will vote as she dictates; the politician has only to\r\nsecure her allegiance and he is sure of the vote in her precinct. The\r\nsuffrage bills which have been presented to the Legislature have not\r\nbeen opposed by the Spanish-American members, but by the\r\nAnglo-Saxons.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[372] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Catherine P.\r\nWallace of Santa Fé, president of the Territorial Suffrage\r\nAssociation. While Mr. Wallace was consul-general to Australia, in\r\n1890, she visited New Zealand and assisted the women there in their\r\nsuccessful effort for the franchise. When this subject was before the\r\nAustralian Parliament at Melbourne, she furnished the Premier with the\r\ndebate in the United States Congress on the admission of Wyoming, and\r\nwith other documents.\r\n\r\n[373] Mrs. Nelson visited Raton, Blossburg, Albuquerque, Santa Fé,\r\nSpringer, Las Vegas, Watrous, Wagon Mound, Socorro, San Marcial, Las\r\nCruces, Deming, Silver City, Hillsboro and Kingston, giving two or\r\nthree lectures at each place and leaving a club in many.\r\n\r\n[374] Among the best known of the advocates are Mrs. M. J. Borden,\r\nProfessor and Mrs. Hiram Hadley of the Agricultural College, President\r\nand Mrs. C. L. Herrick and Miss Catherine Fields, all of the\r\nTerritorial University; Mr. and Mrs. Jefferson Raynolds, Judge and\r\nMrs. McFie, Col. and Mrs. I. H. Elliott and Secretary George H.\r\nWallace.\r\n\r\n[375] This law was repealed by the Legislature of 1901, and it was\r\nmade impossible for either husband or wife to convey real property\r\nwithout the signature of the other.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVI.\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.[376]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe State of New York, home of Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Susan B.\r\nAnthony, may be justly described as the great battle-ground for the\r\nrights of women, a title which will not be denied by any who have read\r\nthe preceding three volumes of this History. The first Woman's Rights\r\nConvention in the world was called at Seneca Falls in 1848.[377] New\r\nYork was also a pioneer in beginning a reform of the old English\r\nCommon Law, so barbarous in its treatment of women. And yet, with all\r\nthe splendid work which has been done, the State has been slow indeed\r\nin granting absolute justice. At the commencement of the new century,\r\nhowever, the legal and educational rights of women are very generally\r\nconceded, but their political rights are still largely denied. Except\r\nduring the Civil War, there has not been a year since 1851 when one or\r\nmore conventions have not been held to demand these rights, and when a\r\ncommittee of women has not visited the Legislature to secure the\r\nnecessary action. A State association was formed in 1869.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1884 met in the Common Council Chamber at Albany,\r\nMarch 11, 12, with the usual large attendance of delegates from all\r\nparts of the State, and the evening sessions so crowded that an\r\noverflow meeting was held in Geological Hall. Mrs. Lillie Devereux\r\nBlake, the president, was in the chair and addresses were made by\r\nMesdames Matilda Joslyn Gage, Mary Seymour Howell, Caroline Gilkey\r\nRogers and Henrica Iliohan; and by Mrs. Abigail Scott Duniway of\r\nOregon, Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton Harbert of Illinois and Mrs. Helen M.\r\nGougar of Indiana, who had come from the national convention in\r\nWashington. On the way to Albany a large reception had been tendered\r\nto them at the Hoffman House in New York. On March 13 a hearing was\r\nheld in the Assembly Chamber before the Judiciary Committee on the\r\nbill for Full Suffrage for women. The room was filled and strong\r\nspeeches were made by all of the above women. Gov. Grover Cleveland\r\ngave a courteous reception to the delegates.\r\n\r\nIn 1885 the convention took place in Steinway Hall, New York, February\r\n12, 13, all the counties being represented by delegate or letter. The\r\nspeakers were Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, Mrs. Gage, Mrs. Howell,\r\nMrs. Rogers and the Rev. Dr. Charles H. Eaton and Mrs. Delia S.\r\nParnell (mother of Charles Stewart Parnell). On the evening of the\r\n12th a large reception to Mrs. Stanton was given at the Murray Hill\r\nHotel.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1886 met in Masonic Hall, New York, March 23, 24.\r\nAddresses were made by Miss Susan B. Anthony, James Redpath, Mesdames\r\nBlake, Howell, Rogers and Iliohan, Gov. John W. Hoyt of Wyoming and\r\nMrs. Margaret Moore of Ireland. A reception was tendered to Dr.\r\nClemence S. Lozier at the Park Avenue Hotel.\r\n\r\nIn the fall an interesting observance was arranged by the State\r\nSuffrage Association when the statue of Liberty Enlightening the\r\nWorld, given to the American nation by France, was unveiled on October\r\n28. There was a great excursion down the bay to witness this ceremony\r\nand the association chartered a boat which was filled with friends of\r\nthe cause. A place was secured in the line between two of the great\r\nwarships, and, while the cannon thundered a salute to the majestic\r\nfemale figure which embodied Freedom, speeches were made on the\r\nsuffrage boat by Mrs. Blake, Mrs. Margaret Parker of England, Mrs.\r\nHarriette R. Shattuck of Massachusetts, Mrs. Gage, Mrs. Howell and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nThe convention met again in New York at Masonic Hall, April 21, 22,\r\n1887, and was addressed by Madame Clara Neymann, Rabbi Gustave\r\nGottheil, Mrs. Florence McCabe, Mrs. Gage, Mrs. Howell, Dr. Lozier and\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the annual meeting assembled at the same place, March 22, 23.\r\nIt was attended by the many delegates who had come from European\r\ncountries to the International Congress of Women about to be held in\r\nWashington, D. C. Among the speakers were Baroness Alexandra\r\nGripenberg of Finland and Mrs. Ashton Dilke, Mrs. Alice Scatcherd and\r\nMrs. Zadel Barnes Gustafson of England. On the evening preceding the\r\nopening of the convention a large reception was given to these foreign\r\nladies at the Park Avenue Hotel.\r\n\r\nThe State convention was held in Rochester, Dec. 16, 17, 1890, in the\r\nFirst Universalist Church. Its distinguishing feature was the\r\nreception given in the Chamber of Commerce to Miss Susan B. Anthony by\r\nher fellow townsmen, as a welcome home from her long and hard campaign\r\nin South Dakota. The large rooms were handsomely decorated and over\r\n600 people were present during the evening, including President David\r\nJayne Hill and a number of the faculty of Rochester University,\r\nseveral members of Congress and many men of prominence.\r\n\r\nThe speakers at the convention were Miss Mary F. Eastman of Boston,\r\nthe Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, Mrs. Greenleaf, Mrs. Blake, Mrs. Howell and\r\nMiss Anthony. Mrs. Blake positively declined a re-election, having\r\nserved eleven consecutive years, and Mrs. Jean Brooks Greenleaf was\r\nelected president. During Mrs. Blake's presidency she had many times\r\ncanvassed New York and had extended her lecture tours into various\r\nother States, going as far west as California.\r\n\r\nHenceforth, in addition to annual conventions, the association adopted\r\nthe plan of holding mid-year executive meetings in various cities for\r\nthe transaction of business, with public sessions in the evenings\r\naddressed by the best speakers.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the convention met in Auburn, November 10, 11, the audiences\r\ncrowding the opera house on both evenings. Miss Anthony, Mrs.\r\nGreenleaf, Mrs. Blake, Mrs. Howell and Miss Shaw were the speakers,\r\nwith an address of welcome from Mrs. J. Mary Pearson. Reports showed\r\nthat the membership had doubled in the last year, and that Woman's Day\r\nhad been observed at many fairs, resulting in the forming of county\r\norganizations. A resolution was adopted urging the Legislature to\r\nappoint some women on the State Board of Managers for the Columbian\r\nExposition in 1893. The convention closed with a reception at the\r\nelegant home of Mrs. Eliza Wright Osborne, niece of Lucretia Mott and\r\ndaughter of Martha C. Wright, two of those who called the first\r\nWoman's Rights Convention.\r\n\r\nSyracuse was selected for the annual meeting of 1892, November 15-17.\r\nMiss Anthony, president of the National Association, was in\r\nattendance, and the opera house was filled at all the sessions. Mrs.\r\nMartha T. Henderson, vice-president-at-large, who had been appointed\r\nto represent the State, was delegated to arrange for the noon-day\r\nsuffrage meetings during the Columbian Exposition. Mrs. Greenleaf's\r\naddress reviewed the great debate which had taken place at the New\r\nYork Chautauqua Assembly the preceding August, between the Rev. Anna\r\nHoward Shaw and the Rev. J. M. Buckley, editor of the _Christian\r\nAdvocate_, and emphasized the evident sympathy of the immense audience\r\nwith the side of the question presented by the former. Suffrage Day\r\nhad been observed at the Cassadaga Lake Assembly with an address by\r\nMiss Anthony, and also at the State Fair. The association was\r\ncongratulated on the fact that there had been a further extension of\r\nSchool Suffrage during the year.\r\n\r\nAll interest centered in the approaching convention to revise the\r\nconstitution of the State, through which it was hoped a woman suffrage\r\namendment would be obtained. Miss Anthony, Mrs. Blake and Mrs. Howell\r\nhad been appointed to address the Legislature, which they had done in\r\nApril of this year, for the purpose of securing women delegates to\r\nthis convention, that was to be held in 1893, but eventually was\r\ndeferred one year. Committees were appointed which visited the\r\npolitical State conventions the following summer, asking a declaration\r\nin their platforms for this amendment, but were unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of 1893 was held at Brooklyn, in Long Island\r\nHistorical Hall, Nov. 13-16. It was welcomed by Mrs. Mariana Wright\r\nChapman, president of the Brooklyn suffrage society. The plan of work\r\nwas perfected, which had been prepared by Miss Anthony and Mrs.\r\nStanton, for an active canvass of the State in behalf of a plank in\r\nthe approaching Constitutional Convention. Addresses were made by Mrs.\r\nJulia Ward Howe and Henry B. Blackwell of Boston, Miss Anthony, the\r\nRev. Miss Shaw, national vice-president-at-large; Mrs. Ella A. Boole,\r\nAaron M. Powell, Gen. C. T. Christiansen, Mrs. Anna C. Field, Mrs.\r\nEmma Bourne, Mrs. Blake and others. Among the resolutions adopted was\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n     The thanks of this association are due to Gov. Roswell P. Flower\r\n     for his recognition of woman's ability in the appointment to a\r\n     State office of our national president, Susan B. Anthony, viz: as\r\n     one of the Board of Managers of the State Industrial School at\r\n     Rochester.\r\n\r\nThe great campaign of 1894, undertaken to secure a clause for woman\r\nsuffrage in the revised State constitution, will be considered further\r\non in this chapter.\r\n\r\nThe annual convention met in Ithaca, Nov. 12-14, 1894, the opera house\r\nbeing filled with the usual large audiences. It was welcomed by Mayor\r\nClinton D. Bouton and President Jacob Gould Schurmann of Cornell\r\nUniversity. Miss Anthony was present and a galaxy of eloquent New York\r\nwomen made addresses.\r\n\r\nNewburgh entertained the convention Nov. 8-12, 1895. The speakers were\r\nMiss Anthony, Dr. Edward McGlynn, Miss Elizabeth Burrill Curtis,\r\ndaughter of George William Curtis; Miss Arria S. Huntington, daughter\r\nof Bishop Frederick D. Huntington; Miss Margaret Livingston Chanler,\r\nMadame Neymann, Mrs. Maude S. Humphrey, Mrs. Chapman, Mrs. Cornelia K.\r\nHood, Miss Julie Jenney, Mrs. Boole, Mrs. Annie E. P. Searing, Mrs. M.\r\nR. Almy, Miss Harriette A. Keyser, Mrs. Blake, Mrs. Howell, the Rev.\r\nMiss Shaw and Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the national\r\norganization committee. Miss Anthony was especially stirred by a\r\nprevious speech which reflected on the dress, manners and social\r\nstanding of the pioneers in the movement for the rights of women, and\r\nwhich felicitated the present advocates on their great superiority in\r\nthese respects. She named the pioneers, one by one, paid warm tribute\r\nto their beautiful personality and commanding ability and asked where\r\na woman could be found in all the present generation to excel, if,\r\nindeed, to equal them.\r\n\r\nThe delegates enjoyed visits to the many interesting places in the\r\nneighborhood, including West Point and Vassar College. A beautiful\r\nreception was given by Mrs. C. S. Jenkins. It was supposed that the\r\ndisappointment of the previous year in failing to secure an amendment\r\nfrom the Constitutional Convention would result in a falling off in\r\nmembership, but instead this was found to be considerably augmented.\r\nAt the close of the convention the delegates went to New York to\r\nattend Mrs. Stanton's eightieth birthday reception at the Metropolitan\r\nOpera House.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1896 was held in Rochester, November 18, 19, with\r\nmore delegates present than ever before. It was preceded by a\r\nreception on the evening of the 17th, where the guests were delighted\r\nto greet Miss Anthony and her little band, who had arrived that\r\nmorning from their arduous field of labor in the California amendment\r\ncampaign. The welcome for the city was extended by Mayor George\r\nWarner. Many of the speakers of the previous year were present, with\r\nthe addition of the Rev. Antoinette Brown Blackwell, the first\r\nordained woman minister, and the noted colored woman of anti-slavery\r\ndays, Harriet Tubman. The press chairman, Mrs. Elnora Monroe Babcock,\r\nreported that, instead of the 135 newspapers of the year before, 253\r\nin the State were now using suffrage matter regularly furnished by her\r\ncommittee.\r\n\r\nOn the Friday night succeeding the convention a banquet was given in\r\nhonor of Miss Anthony, with over 200 guests. Mrs. Mary Lewis Gannett\r\nwas toastmistress and Miss Anthony and Miss Shaw made interesting\r\naddresses.\r\n\r\nMrs. Greenleaf, who had done such heroic work during the past six\r\nyears and sustained the association on so high a plane, felt obliged\r\nto decline a re-election, and Mrs. Mariana Wright Chapman was\r\nunanimously chosen for her place. Mrs. Greenleaf was appointed\r\nfraternal delegate to the annual meeting of the State Grange, and Mrs.\r\nHowell to the State Labor Convention, and both were cordially\r\nreceived. The Grange had on several occasions declared for woman\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nGeneva extended a welcome to the convention Nov. 3-5, 1897, and\r\nsuccessful meetings were held in Collins Hall and the opera house. The\r\nspeakers from abroad and many delegates were entertained at the\r\nhandsome home of Mrs. Elizabeth Smith Miller, daughter of Gerrit\r\nSmith. Added to the usual list were Miss Alice Stone Blackwell,\r\nrecording secretary of the National Association; the Rev. Annis Ford\r\nEastman, Mrs. Gannett, Mrs. Mary E. Craigie, and Miss M. F. Blaine,\r\nCharles Hemiup, W. Smith O'Brien, the Rev. Remick and Dr. William H.\r\nJordan of Geneva. A pleasant event of the year had been the carving of\r\nMiss Anthony's face on the stairway of the magnificent new Capitol\r\nbuilding at Albany, by order of George W. Aldridge, State\r\nsuperintendent of public works.\r\n\r\nOn April 28, 29, 1898, the fortieth anniversary of the first Woman's\r\nRights Convention was held in Rochester. This city also had\r\nentertained that convention which had adjourned in Seneca Falls to\r\nhold a session here. The anniversary proceedings took place afternoons\r\nand evenings in the Central Presbyterian church with a fine corps of\r\nspeakers.[378]\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 8-11, 1898, the annual meeting was held in the court house at\r\nHudson. It was welcomed by the mayor, Richard A. M. Deeley, for the\r\ncity and by Mrs. Mary Holsapple for the local suffrage club. An\r\naddress of greeting also was given by Judge Levi S. Longley, and the\r\nHudson Club extended its courtesies. A letter from Mrs. Stanton was\r\nread by her daughter, Mrs. Harriot Stanton Blatch of England, who also\r\nmade an address. Many of the strong speakers were present who have\r\nbeen frequently mentioned in connection with these State conventions.\r\nThe treasurer reported receipts for the year $3,220.\r\n\r\nChautauqua County invited the convention of 1899 to Dunkirk, November\r\n1-3, and entertained it royally. There was a reception on the first\r\nevening, and a luncheon was given every day to the delegates who\r\nwished to remain at the hall between sessions. Both day and evening\r\nmeetings were large and enthusiastic, the former held at the Woman's\r\nUnion, the latter in Academy Hall. Mayor Alexander Williams welcomed\r\nthe convention for the city, and Mrs. Ellen Cheney for the county in a\r\nwitty poem, Mrs. Chapman responding. Stirring addresses were made by\r\nthe Hon. F. S. Nixon and Dr. J. T. Williams. Miss Anthony was present,\r\nwith many of the old speakers and several new ones, among them Mrs.\r\nCarrie E. S. Twing.\r\n\r\nThe last annual meeting of the century convened at Glens Falls, Oct.\r\n29-Nov. 1, 1900, in Ordway Hall. Addresses of welcome were made by the\r\nHon. Addison B. Colvin and the president of the Warren County\r\nassociation, Mrs. Susie M. Bain. Mrs. Chapman Catt, Miss Shaw, Mrs.\r\nBoole, president State Woman's Christian Temperance Union; Mrs.\r\nChapman, Mrs. Howell and Miss Harriet May Mills were among the\r\nprincipal speakers. A notable feature was the presence of many bright\r\nand enthusiastic young workers. Pledges of support were made for the\r\nnational bazar to be held the next month in New York.\r\n\r\nAmong the resolutions adopted was one congratulating Miss Anthony upon\r\nher success in raising the last of the $50,000 fund which was to open\r\nthe doors of Rochester University to women.\r\n\r\nIn addition to this long array of conventions without a break, the\r\nmid-year executive meetings in various cities have been of almost\r\nequal interest. At nearly every one of these State conventions Miss\r\nAnthony has assisted with her inspiring presence and strong words of\r\ncounsel. To many of them Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton, not able to come\r\nin person, has sent ringing letters of encouragement, for which the\r\naffectionate greetings of the delegates have been returned. New York\r\nhas the largest membership of any State in the Union and pays the\r\nlargest amount of money into the national treasury each year, not\r\nalone in auxiliary dues, but in private subscriptions.\r\n\r\nThe State association has had but three presidents in over twenty\r\nyears: Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake, 1879-1890; Mrs. Jean Brooks\r\nGreenleaf, 1890-1896; Mrs. Mariana W. Chapman, 1896 and still serving.\r\nMrs. Matilda Joslyn Gage was continuously in office from the time a\r\nState association first existed.[379]\r\n\r\nWith active work in progress for so many years, and with suffrage\r\norganizations in the counties and towns throughout all of this large\r\nState, it would be impossible to make personal mention of even a small\r\nfraction of those who have aided the movement. The hundreds who have\r\nfurnished the money and the thousands who have served in a quiet way\r\nthrough all the years would require a separate chapter.[380]\r\n\r\nIt would be equally impossible to describe the efforts made from year\r\nto year, the meetings held, the memorials presented to political\r\nconventions, the debates, the parliamentary drills, the lecture\r\ncourses, the millions of pages of literature distributed, the\r\nstruggles to place women on the school boards, the special efforts of\r\nthe standing committees on legislation, press, industries, work among\r\nchildren, etc. It is far more difficult to write the history of a\r\nState where so much has been done than where the tale may be quickly\r\ntold. No State is better organized for suffrage work.[381] There is no\r\ndoubt that a strong sentiment exists outside of New York City in favor\r\nof the enfranchisement of women. However, with the adverse influence\r\nalways exerted by a great metropolis, it is impossible to foretell\r\nwhen this will be accomplished.\r\n\r\nCONSTITUTIONAL AMENDMENT: The history of the struggle of a\r\ncomparatively few women to secure a clause for equal suffrage in the\r\nState constitution, when it was revised in 1894, told in the fewest\r\npossible words, is as follows:[382]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1887 Gov. David B. Hill, at the earnest request of the\r\nState Suffrage Association, had recommended that women should have a\r\nrepresentation in the convention which would frame this revision. Miss\r\nSusan B. Anthony, Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake, Mrs. Mary Seymour\r\nHowell and Mrs. Caroline Gilkey Rogers addressed a joint committee of\r\nthe Legislature urging that women delegates should be permitted to sit\r\nin this convention. Mrs. Blake also prepared a strong written appeal\r\nwhich was sent to every member. Gov. Roswell P. Flower in his message\r\nin 1892 made a similar recommendation. Again Miss Anthony, Mrs. Blake\r\nand Mrs. Howell made a plea for women, this time before the Assembly\r\nJudiciary Committee.\r\n\r\nThe original bill provided for a certain number of delegates to be\r\nappointed by the Governor, among these four to represent the\r\nProhibitionists, three the Labor Party and three the Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation. The power of the Governor to appoint was afterwards\r\ndeclared unconstitutional. A bill allowing three women delegates\r\npassed the Assembly, but was defeated in the Senate. The act which\r\nfinally was secured provided that all the delegates should be elected,\r\nand that there should be two representatives each for the Prohibition,\r\nLabor and Socialist parties. None was granted to the Suffragists; but\r\nthe law said: \"The electors may elect any citizen of the State above\r\nthe age of twenty-one years.\"\r\n\r\nThe following was then sent to each of the political party\r\nconventions, through properly accredited delegates:\r\n\r\n     Among other duties incumbent upon the members of your honorable\r\n     body is that of nominating delegates-at-large to the convention\r\n     called for the revision of the State constitution. As women are\r\n     eligible to these positions we offer you the names of three who\r\n     have been selected by the executive board of the State W. S. A.\r\n     as their choice of delegates for that convention, with the hope\r\n     that you will accept them as candidates of your own.\r\n\r\nThe names presented were those of Miss Anthony, Mrs. Howell and Miss\r\nEmily Howland, the last a large taxpayer and an excellent business\r\nwoman. The ladies were courteously listened to by the Democrats, and\r\nrefused an opportunity to speak by the Republicans. Similar efforts\r\nwere made in district conventions.\r\n\r\nBoth Republicans and Democrats, however, refused to nominate any\r\nwomen, the compensation of $10 per day, in addition to the political\r\npower conferred, making the positions entirely too valuable to give to\r\na disfranchised class. The name of even Susan B. Anthony was declined\r\nby the Republicans of her district. The Democrats of that district,\r\nwho were in a hopeless minority, made the one exception in the whole\r\nState and nominated Mrs. Jean Brooks Greenleaf, who ran some votes\r\nahead of the rest of the ticket.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  MARY S. ANTHONY.\r\n  Rochester, N. Y.\r\n\r\n          JEAN BROOKS GREENLEAF.\r\n          Rochester. N. Y.\r\n\r\n      MARIANA W. CHAPMAN.\r\n      Brooklyn, N. Y.\r\n\r\n  EMILY HOWLAND.\r\n  Sherwood, N. Y.\r\n\r\n          ELIZA WRIGHT OSBORNE.\r\n          Auburn, N. Y.\r\n\r\n]\r\n\r\nEvery effort was now directed toward obtaining a clause in the new\r\nconstitution, as there was little doubt that if this could be done it\r\nwould be adopted with the rest of that instrument. An eloquent appeal\r\nwas issued to all the friends of liberty throughout the State, urging\r\nthem to assist in securing this measure of justice to women. A\r\ncampaign was carefully planned with an ability which would have been\r\ncreditable to experienced political managers, and $10,000 were raised\r\nand expended with the most rigid economy.[383]\r\n\r\nTo save rent headquarters were established in Miss Anthony's own home\r\nin Rochester, which soon became a beehive of industry, and the work\r\nincreased until practically every room was pressed into service. The\r\npresident of the State association and campaign committee, Mrs.\r\nGreenleaf, and the corresponding secretary, Miss Mary S. Anthony, gave\r\npractically every hour of their time for six months to this great\r\neffort. The postoffice daily sent mail sacks to the house, which were\r\nfilled with petitions and other documents and set out on the porch for\r\ncollection.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony herself, at the age of seventy-four, spoke in every one\r\nof the sixty counties of the State, contributing her services and\r\nexpenses. This series of mass meetings was managed by Miss Harriet May\r\nMills and Miss Mary G. Hay. The Rev. Anna Howard Shaw spoke at forty\r\nof these, and Mrs. Howell at a large number. The entire management of\r\nNew York City was put into the hands of Mrs. Blake, while the campaign\r\nfor Brooklyn was conducted by Mrs. Mariana W. Chapman. Mrs. Carrie\r\nChapman Catt made thirty-eight speeches in these two cities and\r\nvicinity. Mrs. Stanton, from her home in New York, sent many strong\r\narticles to the metropolitan press, which were copied throughout the\r\nState. Mrs. Martha R. Almy. State vice-president, was an active\r\nworker.\r\n\r\nWomen of social influence in this city, who never had shown any public\r\ninterest in the question, opened headquarters at Sherry's, held\r\nmeetings and secured signatures to a suffrage petition. The leaders of\r\nthis branch were Mrs. Josephine Shaw Lowell, Mrs. Joseph H. Choate,\r\nDr. Mary Putnam Jacobi, Mrs. J. Warren Goddard, Mrs. Robert Abbe, Mrs.\r\nHenry M. Sanders and Miss Adele M. Fielde. Among those who signed the\r\npetition were Chauncey M. Depew, Russell Sage, Frederick Coudert, the\r\nRev. Heber Newton, the Rev. W. S. Rainsford, Bishop Henry C. Potter,\r\nRabbi Gustave Gottheil, John D. Rockefeller, Robert J. Ingersoll and\r\nWilliam Dean Howells.\r\n\r\nOne of the surprises of the campaign was the organization in Albany of\r\na small body of women calling themselves \"remonstrants,\" under the\r\nleadership of the Episcopal bishop, William Croswell Doane, and Mrs.\r\nJohn V. L. Pruyn. Another branch was organized in New York City by\r\nMrs. Francis M. Scott, and one in Brooklyn with Mrs. Lyman Abbott at\r\nthe head and the support of her husband's paper, _The Outlook_.\r\n\r\nThe suffrage forces circulated 5,000 petitions and secured 332,148\r\nindividual signatures, about half of them women (including 36,000\r\ncollected by the W. C. T. U.) and memorials from labor organizations\r\nand Granges, bringing the total, in round numbers, to 600,000.[384]\r\nThe \"remonstrants\" obtained only 15,000 signatures, yet at that time\r\nand ever afterwards many of the newspapers insisted that the vast\r\npreponderance of sentiment among men and women was opposed to equal\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nA part of the work was to collect statistics showing the amount of\r\nproperty on which taxes were paid by women. It was impossible to\r\nobtain these in New York City, but in three-fifths of the towns and\r\ncities outside it was found to be $348,177,107. In Brooklyn women paid\r\none-fourth of all the taxes. The drudgery of preparing these tax lists\r\nand recounting and labeling all the petitions was done chiefly by Miss\r\nIsabel Howland.\r\n\r\nDuring the convention an office and a reception room in the Capitol\r\nwere granted for the use of the women. On May 24 Miss Anthony and Mrs.\r\nGreenleaf addressed the Suffrage Committee of the Constitutional\r\nConvention in the Assembly Chamber of the Capitol at Albany. A large\r\ncrowd was present, including the committee and most of the delegates.\r\nMrs. Greenleaf's remarks were brief but forcible, and Miss Anthony\r\nspoke earnestly for three-quarters of an hour, seeming to have the\r\nfull sympathy of her audience.\r\n\r\nThe women of New York City were accorded a hearing on May 31, and\r\nstrong arguments were made by Dr. Jacobi, Miss Margaret Livingstone\r\nChanler, Mrs. Blake and Miss Harriette A. Keyser. On June 7 the\r\nSuffrage Committee was addressed by representative women, in\r\nfive-minute speeches, from all of the Senatorial districts outside of\r\nNew York City.[385] Mrs. Greenleaf presided at all these\r\nmeetings.[386]\r\n\r\nThe final hearing was accorded June 28, when U. S. Senator Joseph M.\r\nCarey, who had come from Wyoming by invitation for this purpose, made\r\na most convincing argument based on the practical experience of his\r\nown State for twenty-five years. He was followed by Mrs. Howell and\r\nMrs. Mary T. Burt, president of the State W. C. T. U.\r\n\r\nAll of these addresses in favor of recognizing woman's right to the\r\nfranchise were valueless except for the creation of public sentiment\r\nand as a matter of history, for the chairman of the convention, the\r\nHon. Joseph H. Choate, had appointed a Suffrage Committee the large\r\nmajority of whom were known anti-suffragists, and he was reported to\r\nhave said before the convention met that the amendment should not be\r\nplaced in the constitution. The committee made an adverse report,\r\nwhich was discussed by the convention on the evenings of August 8 and\r\n15, with the Assembly Chamber crowded at each session.[387] The\r\nadvocates of adopting a woman suffrage plank were led by the Hon.\r\nEdward Lauterbach and the opponents by Mr. Root and William P.\r\nGoodelle, chairman of the Suffrage Committee.[388]\r\n\r\nWhile the ballot was being taken Mr. Choate went on the floor among\r\nthe delegates, and himself gave the last vote against the amendment.\r\nThe ballot resulted--in favor of the amendment, 58; opposed, 98.\r\n\r\nEven though a defeat, this was a decided advance over the\r\nConstitutional Convention of 1867, when there were but 19 ayes and 125\r\nnoes. Then less than one-seventh, this time more than one-third of the\r\nmembers were in favor of the enfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\nThe following month Miss Anthony and Mr. Lauterbach addressed the\r\nCommittee on Resolutions of the State Republican Convention, and Miss\r\nAnthony and Mrs. Blake that of the Democratic, asking for a\r\nrecognition of woman suffrage in their platforms, but both ignored the\r\nrequest.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony were the pioneers in legislative work for woman suffrage, the\r\nformer making her first speech before a committee--in behalf of\r\nproperty rights--as early as 1845, and continuing her appeals for the\r\nvarious rights of women during twenty-five years, after which her\r\naddresses were given usually before the committees of the United\r\nStates Congress. Miss Anthony made her first appearance in Albany in\r\n1853, and her last one before a committee there in 1897. She devoted\r\nher strongest efforts to the Legislature of her own State until the\r\ndemands of national work became so great as to absorb most of her\r\ntime, and then she, too, transferred her appeals to the legislative\r\nbody of the United States, although assisting always the work in New\r\nYork.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile other competent laborers had come into the field. In 1873\r\nMrs. Lillie Devereux Blake began her legislative work, and for\r\ntwenty-five years there were few bills in the interests of women under\r\nconsideration at Albany which were not managed by her, with an able\r\ncorps of assistants, chief among whom was Mrs. Mary Seymour Howell.\r\n\r\nFor fifty years there is an almost unbroken record of the efforts of\r\nwomen to secure equality of rights from the Legislature of New York,\r\nand they have succeeded to the extent that now, with the exception of\r\nthe statute providing for dower and curtesy, but few serious\r\ndiscriminations exist against women in the laws, although the\r\ninjustice of disfranchisement has been mitigated in only a slight\r\ndegree.\r\n\r\nWhen the Legislature assembled on Jan. 1, 1884, Mrs. Blake and Mrs.\r\nHowell were at hand to further the interests of the pending bill \"to\r\nprohibit disfranchisement on account of sex.\" On March 13 a hearing\r\nwas held in the Assembly Chamber before the Judiciary Committee and a\r\nlarge audience. The speakers were Mrs. Abigail Scott Duniway of\r\nOregon, Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton Harbert of Illinois and Mrs. Helen M.\r\nGougar of Indiana, Mrs. Blake, Mrs. Howell and Mrs. Caroline Gilkey\r\nRogers. On May 8, after an exciting debate, the bill was defeated--57\r\nayes, 62 noes.\r\n\r\nThe bill of 1885 was drawn by Mrs. Blake and was accompanied by a\r\nstrong written argument, with many court decisions to show that it was\r\nwithin the power of the Legislature itself to protect all citizens\r\nfrom disfranchisement. This was presented by Gen. James W. Husted,\r\nspeaker of the House. Two hearings were given in the Assembly\r\nChamber, at which addresses were made by Mrs. Stanton, Mrs. Blake,\r\nMrs. Howell, Mrs. Rogers and Gov. John W. Hoyt of Wyoming.\r\n\r\nThe bill was debated April 7. General Husted, Mayor James Haggerty and\r\nDr. J. T. Williams spoke in favor; Gen. N. M. Curtis and Kidder Scott\r\nin opposition. The vote stood 57 ayes, 56 noes, but a constitutional\r\nmajority was lacking.\r\n\r\nDuring the summer Mrs. Blake spoke in almost every district whose\r\nmember had voted against the measure.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 a bill for Municipal Suffrage only was presented, drawn by\r\nAugustus Levy and introduced in the Senate by George Z. Erwin, in the\r\nHouse by Speaker Husted. On February 10 a hearing took place in the\r\nAssembly Chamber. Mrs. Blake presided and the speakers were Mrs.\r\nMatilda Joslyn Gage, Mrs. Howell, Mrs. Rogers and Mrs. Annie Jenness\r\nMiller. On March 2 the Senate gave a hearing to Mr. Levy and James\r\nRedpath. The campaign this winter was one of the most vigorous ever\r\nmade. Besides the executive officers of the State association, who\r\nwere in Albany some days of every week, much help was secured by the\r\noccasional visits of prominent women and the numerous letters of\r\ninfluential people from all parts of the State. On the night of the\r\nfinal vote the Assembly Chamber was filled by friends of the measure\r\nand many officials were present, including the Lieutenant-Governor and\r\nthe Attorney-General. As this bill would give women only the right to\r\nvote in municipal affairs, it had many supporters who would not have\r\nfavored full suffrage. The debate was long and earnest, Mr. Erwin,\r\nGeneral Husted, Mr. Longley of Brooklyn, Mr. Freligh of Ulster and\r\nothers speaking in favor, and General Curtis, William F. Sheehan and\r\nothers in opposition. The roll-call was taken in great excitement, and\r\nthe ayes went up until their number reached 65, the constitutional\r\nmajority. A round of applause broke out, but in an instant two men\r\narose and changed their votes from the affirmative to the negative, so\r\nthat on the final call the vote stood, 63 ayes, 52 noes.\r\n\r\nThis winter another law was enacted to remove all doubts as to the\r\nconstitutionality of the one of 1880, which conferred School Suffrage\r\non women in villages and country districts. Representative Charles\r\nSprague introduced a bill making mothers and fathers joint guardians\r\nof their children, but it was defeated.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Mrs. Howell drew up the Municipal Suffrage Bill, which was\r\nintroduced by Senator Erwin. She spent ten days personally\r\ninterviewing every senator until she had the promise of the twenty\r\nvotes which were given the bill on its final passage, seventeen being\r\nnecessary. There were but nine noes.\r\n\r\nAfter the clerk had read the bill in the Assembly, Speaker Husted\r\nsaid: \"If there is no objection this bill will go at once to the third\r\nreading.\" Wm. F. Sheehan, the leading opponent of woman suffrage, was\r\nasleep at the time and so it was thus ordered. Mrs. Howell continued\r\nher efforts, but the measure was defeated--48 ayes, 68 noes--by a\r\nmoneyed influence from New York City, after nearly enough votes to\r\ncarry it had been promised.\r\n\r\nA bill providing police matrons in cities, with the exception of New\r\nYork and Brooklyn, was secured from this Legislature. It had been\r\npassed in 1882, but not signed by Gov. Alonzo B. Cornell; passed again\r\nin the Assembly in 1883, but defeated in the Senate by the Police\r\nDepartment of New York City. The bill was finally secured by the\r\nWoman's Prison Association, but it was not made mandatory and no\r\nattention was paid to it by the city authorities.\r\n\r\nA bill was presented this year to relieve women from the death\r\npenalty, on the ground that since they had not the full privileges of\r\nmen they should not suffer equal punishment. The measure was ably\r\nsupported, but failed to pass.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 the Municipal Suffrage Bill was presented in the Senate by\r\nCharles Coggeshall, and in the Assembly by Danforth E. Ainsworth. A\r\nhearing in the Senate Chamber on February 15 was addressed by Mrs.\r\nBlake, Mrs. Rogers and the Rev. Anna Garlin Spencer of Rhode Island.\r\nThe bill was lost in the Senate by a tie vote, 15 ayes, 15 noes; in\r\nthe House by 48 ayes, 61 noes.\r\n\r\nLaws were enacted at this session providing that there shall be women\r\nphysicians in all State insane asylums where women are patients; and\r\nalso that there shall be at least one woman trustee in all public\r\ninstitutions where women are placed as patients, paupers or criminals.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 the Municipal Suffrage Bill was again presented in the\r\nAssembly by Mr. Ainsworth, but it was lost by 56 ayes, 43 noes, not a\r\nconstitutional majority.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the Municipal Suffrage Bill was presented by Speaker Husted,\r\nbut was defeated by 47 ayes, 52 noes.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 no legislative work was attempted beyond the efforts toward\r\nsecuring a representation of women in the Constitutional Convention,\r\nwhich it was supposed would be held at an early date.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 an act was passed to enable women to vote for County School\r\nCommissioners, which received the signature of Gov. Roswell P. Flower.\r\n\r\nThis year a Police Matron Bill was obtained which was made mandatory\r\nin cities of 100,000 and over. This bill had been passed several times\r\nbefore and vetoed, but it finally obtained the Governor's signature.\r\nEven then the Police Commissioners of New York refused to appoint\r\nmatrons until the matter was taken up by the Woman Suffrage League of\r\nthat city. This was the end of a ten years' struggle on the part of\r\nwomen to secure police matrons in all cities. Most active among the\r\nleaders were Mrs. Mary T. Burt, Mrs. Abby Hopper Gibbons and Mrs.\r\nJosephine Shaw Lowell, backed by the W. C. T. U., the Prison Reform,\r\nthe Suffrage and various other philanthropic and religious societies.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 Hamilton Willcox, who had worked untiringly in the Legislature\r\nfor many years, had a bill introduced in the Assembly to give a vote\r\nto self-supporting women. It was referred to the Judiciary Committee,\r\nbut met with general disfavor. Mrs. Howell being in the Assembly\r\nChamber with friends one evening, three of its members invited her to\r\ngo to their committee room and draw up a bill for Full Suffrage,\r\ntelling her they would report it favorably in place of the Working\r\nWoman's Bill. This she did and the new bill was at once reported. The\r\nnext week she gave every moment to working with the members for it,\r\naided by General Husted, Mr. Willcox and William Sulzer. On Friday\r\nmorning, one week from the day the bill was reported, it came to the\r\nfinal vote and passed by 70 ayes, only 65 being required for the\r\nconstitutional majority. Excitement ran high at this success and ten\r\nminutes were given for congratulations to Mrs. Howell by friends and\r\nfoes alike. The Monday following she carried the bill from the\r\nEngrossing Committee to the Senate. Only three days of the session\r\nwere left and the committee held no more meetings, so she saw\r\nseparately each member of the Judiciary Committee and all gave a\r\nvote in favor of considering the bill. Mr. Sheehan was now\r\nLieutenant-Governor and presiding officer of the Senate and would\r\nallow no courtesies to Mrs. Howell, but one senator, Charles E.\r\nWalker, arranged for her to see every member, and she secured the\r\npromise of 18 votes, 17 being required. On Thursday evening, although\r\nSenator Cornelius R. Parsons made many attempts to secure recognition,\r\nthe bill was not allowed to come before the Senate. There was every\r\nreason to believe Governor Flower would have signed it.[389]\r\n\r\nIn 1893 Mrs. Cornelia H. Cary worked for a bill providing that on all\r\nboards of education one person out of five should be a woman, but it\r\nfailed to pass. The measure making fathers and mothers joint guardians\r\nof their children, so often urged, became a law this year chiefly\r\nthrough the efforts of the Women's Educational and Industrial Union of\r\nBuffalo, which had been hampered constantly in its efforts to care for\r\nhelpless children by the interference of worthless fathers.[390]\r\n\r\nA law also was enacted, championed by Col. George C. Webster, giving\r\nto a married woman the right to make a valid will without her\r\nhusband's consent.\r\n\r\nThe season of 1894 was given wholly to the work of securing a woman\r\nsuffrage amendment in the revised State constitution.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Mrs. Martha R. Almy, as chairman of the Legislative Committee,\r\nbegan work in Albany early in January and was absent but one\r\nlegislative day from that time until May. She was assisted by Mrs.\r\nHelen G. Ecob, and their effort was to secure a resolution to amend\r\nthe constitution by striking out the word \"male.\" In order to submit\r\nsuch an amendment in New York, a resolution must be passed by two\r\nsuccessive Legislatures.\r\n\r\nJudge Charles Z. Lincoln, the legal adviser of Gov. Levi P. Morton,\r\ndrew up the resolution and it was introduced January 22 in the\r\nAssembly by Fred S. Nixon, and in the Senate by Cuthbert W. Pound. It\r\nwas favorably reported by the Senate Judiciary Committee early in the\r\nsession. The chairman of the Assembly Committee, Aaron B. Gardenier,\r\nwas very hostile, and after every effort to get a report had been\r\nexhausted, Mr. Nixon and Mrs. Almy made a personal appeal to the\r\ncommittee and were successful. On March 14 six men brought in the\r\nmammoth petition for woman suffrage which had been presented to the\r\nConstitutional Convention the previous year. The resolution was passed\r\nby 80 ayes, 31 noes. This was a remarkable action for the first\r\nLegislature after the great defeat in the Constitutional Convention\r\nonly a few months before.\r\n\r\nWhen the measure came to the Senate it was moved by Senator Pound to\r\nsubstitute Mr. Nixon's resolution for his own, as they were identical.\r\nBut Amasa J. Parker[391] objected in order to make it run the gauntlet\r\nof the Senate Committee again, and this gave the anti-suffragists an\r\nopportunity to oppose it. He then asked for a hearing for Bishop\r\nWilliam Croswell Doane and others before the State Judiciary\r\nCommittee, of which he was a member, which Chairman Edmond O'Connor\r\ngranted. The committee met but once a week, and twice the hearing was\r\npostponed to accommodate the opposition. The second time, as no one\r\nappeared against the resolution, it was again reported favorably. Just\r\nafter this had been done Mr. Parker appeared and objected, and the\r\nchairman agreed to recall it and give the opposition one more chance.\r\nOn April 10, the time appointed for the hearing, Bishop Doane sent a\r\nletter declining the honor of appearing, but a delegation from New\r\nYork City came up, and Mrs. Francis M. Scott and Prof. Monroe Smith of\r\nColumbia University addressed the committee opposing the measure.\r\nMrs. Almy and Mrs. Mary H. Hunt replied in its behalf. For the third\r\ntime the resolution was reported favorably by the Senate Committee,\r\nand April 18 the vote was taken. Senators Pound, Coggeshall and\r\nBradley spoke in favor, and Jacob H. Cantor in opposition. It was\r\ncarried by 20 ayes, 5 noes.\r\n\r\nWhen the resolution went to the Revision Committee it was found that\r\nin one section there was a period where there should have been a\r\ncomma. Mrs. Almy was obliged to remain two weeks and get an amendment\r\nthrough both Houses to correct this error. Finally the resolution was\r\ndeclared perfect, and was ordered published throughout the State, etc.\r\nThen it was discovered that the word \"resident\" was used instead of\r\n\"citizen,\" and the entire work of the winter was void. As it is not\r\nrequired that copies of original bills shall be preserved, the\r\nresponsibility for the mistake never can be located.\r\n\r\nThe Senate of 1896, by a change in the term of office, was to sit\r\nthree years instead of two; and a concurrent resolution, in order to\r\npass two successive Legislatures, would have to be deferred still\r\nanother year, so no work was attempted.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 4, 1897, when the Legislature assembled, every member found on\r\nhis desk a personally addressed letter appealing for the right of\r\nwomen citizens to representation, signed by all the officers of the\r\nState Suffrage Association and by the presidents of all the local\r\nsocieties. The resolution asking for a suffrage amendment was\r\nintroduced in the Senate by Joseph Mullen, in the Assembly by W. W.\r\nArmstrong, and was referred to the Judiciary Committees. Repeated\r\ninterviews by Mrs. Mariana W. Chapman, Mrs. Mary E. Craigie, chairman\r\nof the legislative committee, and other members were not sufficient to\r\nsecure a favorable vote even from the committees, as they were\r\nfrightened by the action of the preceding Legislature.\r\n\r\nThe New York Society Opposed to the Further Extension of Suffrage to\r\nWomen was at work on the spot, and every legislator received a letter\r\nurging him not to consider any kind of a bill for woman suffrage.\r\nFinally a hearing was appointed by the Senate Committee for March 24.\r\nIn the midst of a snowstorm, all the way from Rochester came the\r\nNational president, Miss Anthony; from New York City, the State\r\npresident, Mrs. Chapman; the chairman of the national organization\r\ncommittee, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt; Dr. Mary Putnam Jacobi and Miss\r\nElizabeth Burrill Curtis; from Syracuse, Miss Harriet May Mills; and\r\nin Albany already were Mrs. Blake, Mrs. Almy, Mrs. Julia D. Sheppard\r\nand a number of local suffragists. Miss Anthony, Mrs. Chapman Catt and\r\nMiss Mills addressed the committee. As the delegation withdrew one\r\nsenator said to another: \"I do not know what is to become of us men\r\nwhen such women as these come up to the Legislature.\" Nevertheless the\r\nresolution was not reported by the committee.\r\n\r\nUnder the auspices of a Civic Union of all the boroughs of the\r\nproposed \"Greater New York,\" an active campaign was carried on during\r\nthis winter to secure various advantages for women under the new\r\ncharter, but it met with no especial success.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 Mrs. Mary Hilliard Loines was chairman of the legislative\r\ncommittee, and Mrs. Florence Dangerfield Potter, a graduate of Cornell\r\nand of the New York University Law School, acted as attorney. The\r\nSuffrage Amendment Resolution was introduced the first week of the\r\nsession by Representative Otto Kelsey, a steadfast friend of woman\r\nsuffrage. The usual number of letters was sent throughout the State to\r\nsecure co-operation and a hearing was given March 2 in the Assembly\r\nlibrary. The speakers introduced by Mrs. Loines were Mrs. Chapman,\r\nMiss Mills, Mrs. Craigie, Miss Margaret Livingstone Chanler and Mrs.\r\nMartha A. B. Conine, a member of the Colorado Legislature. The Rev.\r\nWilliam Brundage of Albany spoke forcibly in favor of the amendment.\r\nNo opponents were present. Although the chairman and some members of\r\nthe committee were in favor, it was learned that the majority were\r\nopposed, so a vote was not pressed. The Senate committee being the\r\nsame as the previous year, it was thought not worth while to introduce\r\nthe resolution into that body.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the legislative work differed from that of the years directly\r\npreceding, the executive committee having decided that it might be\r\nwiser to ask for some form of suffrage which the Legislature itself\r\ncould grant without submitting the question to the voters. The\r\nfollowing bills were authorized:\r\n\r\n     1: To make it obligatory to appoint at least one woman on school\r\n     boards in those cities, about forty-six in all, where the office\r\n     is appointive.\r\n\r\n     2: To amend the village law, making it obligatory that in all\r\n     charters where a special vote of tax-payers is required on\r\n     municipal improvements or the raising or distribution of taxes,\r\n     women properly qualified shall vote on the same basis as men.\r\n\r\nA great many letters had been sent to Gov. Theodore Roosevelt, then\r\nnewly elected, asking him to recognize the rights of women in his\r\ninaugural address, which he did by calling the attention of the\r\nLegislature to \"the desirability of gradually extending the sphere in\r\nwhich the suffrage can be exercised by women.\" These two bills,\r\ntherefore, were sent to him for approval and he appointed an interview\r\nat Albany with a committee from the State association. Mrs. Loines,\r\nMrs. Blake, Miss Mills, Miss Mary Lyman Storrs and Mrs. Nellie F.\r\nMatheson went with the State president to this interview, and the\r\nGovernor cordially indorsed the bills.\r\n\r\nLetters were sent to the legislators and also to the presidents of the\r\ncounty suffrage societies, asking them to influence their\r\nrepresentatives. The bill for the Taxpayers' Suffrage was introduced\r\ninto the Assembly by Mr. Kelsey. That good work was done was evident\r\nby the vote--98 ayes, 9 noes.\r\n\r\nBut the battle was with the Senate, where the bill was introduced by\r\nW. W. Armstrong. On February 22 a hearing was given in the Senate\r\nChamber before the Judiciary Committee. Suffragists and opponents were\r\nthere in force. The latter were represented by Mesdames Arthur M.\r\nDodge, W. Winslow Crannell and Rossiter Johnson. The State president\r\nintroduced the suffrage speakers, Miss Chanler, Mrs. Blake and Mrs.\r\nHarriot Stanton Blatch, the last being qualified from residence to\r\ntestify to the good effect of this kind of suffrage in England. Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Smith Miller, Miss Anne Fitzhugh Miller and others were\r\npresent. Owing largely to the influence of Elon R. Brown the committee\r\nbrought in an adverse report.[392] Senator Armstrong moved to disagree\r\nand the vote, thus called for, in the Senate stood 21 ayes, 24 noes--a\r\nvote on the report, not on the bill, but it put the Senate on record.\r\n\r\nThe Bill for Women on Appointed Boards of Education, which had been\r\nchanged under protest of the suffragists to \"one-third of the members\r\nof the board\" from \"at least one woman,\" was voted on April 19. In the\r\nAssembly it received 59 ayes, 23 noes; but 76 was the constitutional\r\nmajority, so Senate action was useless. It was bitterly opposed by\r\nmany prominent school officers.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 the Legislature made a glaring exhibition of the position in\r\nwhich a non-voting class can be placed. Early in the session a\r\nresolution was offered on the motion of Senator Thomas F. Grady of New\r\nYork City, \"that it is not expedient or advisable to attempt at this\r\nsession any changes in the constitution in regard to woman suffrage.\"\r\nIt passed by 26 ayes, 17 noes. Let it be said, for the honor of the\r\nState, that there were senators who protested indignantly against such\r\ntrampling upon the rights of the people. Several who voted in favor of\r\nthis resolution afterwards voted for the suffrage bill.\r\n\r\nThe Bill for Woman Suffrage on Tax Questions was introduced the very\r\nnext day by Senator Armstrong. Soon afterward it was presented in the\r\nAssembly by Mr. Kelsey. On March 22 it passed with only two negative\r\nvotes--John Hill Morgan of Brooklyn and James B. McEwan of Albany.\r\nWhen this bill came to the Senate there were so many before it that\r\nApril 4 its friends moved to take it up out of order by suspension of\r\nrules. Senators Armstrong, Coggeshall and Lester H. Humphrey spoke in\r\nfavor, Senator Grady against. The vote in favor was 23 ayes, 19 noes\r\n(nine of these from New York City), but twenty-six votes were\r\nnecessary to suspend. The situation, however, was more encouraging\r\nthan the year before. The legislative committee of the State W. S. A.\r\nthis year consisted of Mesdames Loines, Blake, Matheson, Priscilla D.\r\nHackstaff and Ella Hawley Crossett.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 the committee was composed of Mesdames Loines, Hackstaff,\r\nCraigie, Jean Brooks Greenleaf and Lucy P. Allen. All efforts were\r\ncentered on the bill to give taxpaying women the right to vote on\r\nquestions of taxation. A conference with Governor Odell showed his\r\nfriendliness to the bill and disclosed the fact that he had used his\r\ninfluence to amend the charter of his own city of Newburg to give this\r\nprivilege to women.\r\n\r\nSpeaker Nixon, in his opening address, referred to the bill as a\r\nmeasure of justice which he hoped would be introduced every year until\r\nit became a law. Mr. Kelsey for the third time constituted himself its\r\nchampion, and worked earnestly for its success. Letters poured in from\r\nall parts of the State, the W. C. T. U. co-operated cordially, and\r\nhearings were granted by House and Senate committees. The bill passed\r\nthe Assembly February 26 by 83 ayes, 29 noes. Of the latter 18 were\r\nfrom New York City. Of the 38 absent or not voting 22 were from that\r\ncity.\r\n\r\nIn the Senate the bill was referred to the Judiciary Committee as\r\nusual. On March 20 a hearing before this committee was arranged for\r\nthose in favor and opposed. It was conducted by Mrs. Loines for the\r\nsuffragists, who were represented by Mrs. Chapman, Miss Chanler, a\r\nlarge taxpayer in Dutchess County, and Miss Alice Stone Blackwell of\r\nBoston, but a taxpayer in New York. Mrs. Arthur M. Dodge was at the\r\nhead of the eighteen women who came from the anti-suffrage society to\r\nprotest against taxpaying women being granted a representation on\r\nquestions of taxation. The other speakers were Mrs. Rossiter Johnson\r\nof New York City, Mrs. Crannell of Albany, and Mrs. William Putnam of\r\nGroton who read a paper written by Mrs. Charles Wetmore. The first\r\ntook the ground that the bill was unconstitutional. The second\r\nprotested against the attempt \"to force widows, spinsters and married\r\nwomen to vote against their will.\" The third begged the members of the\r\nSenate Committee \"not to be hoodwinked into believing this was not a\r\nsuffrage measure,\" and assured them that \"many of the members had\r\npledged themselves to vote for it without recognizing that it was a\r\nsuffrage bill.\" She also said: \"For the last fifty years, while the\r\nsuffragists have been wasting their strength in the effort to get the\r\nballot, we, and women like us, have been quietly going ahead and\r\ngaining for women the rights they now enjoy in regard to education,\r\nproperty and the professions. The suffragists had nothing to do with\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nThe friends of the bill in the Senate tried in vain to obtain a report\r\nfrom the Judiciary Committee, the chairman, Edgar Truman Brackett,\r\nbeing opposed to the bill. Finally, on April 11, Senator Humphrey\r\nmoved \"to discharge the committee from further consideration,\" which\r\nwas carried by 22 ayes, 20 noes. On April 19 it was brought to a vote\r\nand passed by 27 ayes, 14 noes, 8 of the latter from New York City.\r\nMr. Grady was absent.\r\n\r\nThe bill was signed by Gov. Benjamin F. Odell, April 24, 1901. It was\r\ngenerally understood that U. S. Senator Thomas C. Platt was in favor\r\nof the measure. Judge Charles Z. Lincoln, chairman of the Statutory\r\nRevision Committee, gave most valuable assistance.\r\n\r\nThe effect of this bill was far greater than had been anticipated,\r\nbecause of the importance of New York as a State. Before six months\r\nhad passed women in considerable numbers had voted in a dozen\r\ndifferent places. Although it applied only to towns and villages,\r\nthese numbered about 1,800. What was of more importance, the principle\r\nhad been recognized. There was scarcely a newspaper in the United\r\nStates that did not contain an editorial upon the subject, which in\r\nthe vast majority of cases declared the law to be just.\r\n\r\nLAWS: Dower and curtesy obtain. If the husband die without a will the\r\nwidow is entitled to the life use of one-third of the real estate and,\r\nafter the payment of the debts, to one-third of the personal estate\r\nabsolutely. If there are no children she may have one-half of the\r\nlatter--stocks, cash, furniture, pictures, silver, clothing, etc.--and\r\nthe other half goes to the husband's relatives, even down to nephews\r\nand nieces. The widow may, however, have the whole if it does not\r\nexceed $2,000. If it exceed that amount, $2,000 may be added to her\r\nhalf. If there are no relatives of the husband she may have all the\r\npersonal property. If there has been a living child the widower has a\r\nlife interest in all the wife's estate. If there have been no children\r\nhe takes all the personal property absolutely, and her real estate\r\ngoes to her next of kin. If there is a child living he has one-third\r\nof the personal property absolutely.\r\n\r\nThe husband is liable for the wife's debts before marriage to the\r\nextent of any property acquired from her by ante-nuptial agreement.\r\nShe holds her separate property, however acquired, free from any\r\ncontrol of the husband and from all liability for his debts. She can\r\nlive on her own real estate, and forbid her husband entering upon it.\r\n\r\nEither husband or wife can make a will without the knowledge or\r\nconsent of the other, the latter disposing of all her separate\r\nproperty, the former of all but the wife's life interest in one-third\r\nof the real estate. The law provides, however, that no person having\r\nhusband, wife, child or parent can bequeath over one-half of his\r\nproperty, after payment of debts, to any institution, association or\r\ncorporation.\r\n\r\nThe wife can mortgage or convey her real and personal estate without\r\nthe husband's signature. He may do this with his personal property but\r\nnot with his real estate.\r\n\r\nA married woman may carry on any trade or business and perform any\r\nlabor or services on her own account, and her earnings are her sole\r\nand separate property. She may sue and be sued as if unmarried, and\r\nmay maintain an action in her own name and the proceeds of such action\r\nwill be her separate property.[393]\r\n\r\nShe may contract as if unmarried and she and her separate estate are\r\nliable. A woman engaged in business can not be arrested for a debt\r\nfraudulently contracted. All women enjoy certain exemptions from the\r\nsale of their property under execution which in the case of men are\r\ngranted only to householders--that is, a man who provides for a\r\nfamily.\r\n\r\nThe husband's creditors have no claim to a life insurance unless the\r\nannual premiums have exceeded $500; and it is also exempt from\r\nexecution for the wife's debts.\r\n\r\nCommon Law marriages are legal, requiring neither license nor\r\nceremony, and 14 years is the legal age for the girl.[394]\r\n\r\nAbsolute divorce is granted only for adultery. In case of either\r\nabsolute or limited divorce the husband may be required to pay alimony\r\nto the wife during her life, even if she should marry again.\r\n\r\nEvery married woman is joint guardian of her children with her\r\nhusband, having equal powers, rights and duties in regard to them, and\r\non the death of either parent the survivor continues guardian. (1893.)\r\n\r\nA husband is required to support his wife commensurately with his\r\nmeans and her station in the community, without regard to the extent\r\nof her individual property. If he fail to do this or if he abandon his\r\nfamily he may be arrested and compelled to give security that he will\r\nprovide for them and will indemnify the town, city or county against\r\ntheir becoming a charge upon the public within one year. Failing, he\r\nmay be sent to prison or penitentiary for not less than six months'\r\nhard labor, or until he gives such bond, but none of this is\r\nobligatory on the court.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 16\r\nyears, and it was made optional with the court to impose less than the\r\nexisting penalty of ten years' imprisonment. A few years afterward it\r\nwas proposed to reduce the age to 12 years. Mrs. Mary H. Hunt, in\r\nbehalf of the W. C. T. U., went before the Judiciary Committee and\r\nsaid: \"I represent 21,000 women and any man who dares to vote for this\r\nmeasure will be marked and held up to scorn. We are terribly in\r\nearnest.\" The matter was dropped. In 1895 the age was raised from 16\r\nto 18, with a penalty for first degree of not more than twenty years'\r\nimprisonment; for second degree, not more than ten. No minimum penalty\r\nis named. Trials may be held privately, and it is the testimony of the\r\nvarious protective associations of women that it is almost impossible\r\nto secure convictions.\r\n\r\nThe laws contain many provisions for the benefit of female employes;\r\namong them one that if any employer in New York City fail to pay wages\r\ndue up to $50, none of his property is exempt from execution and he\r\nmay be imprisoned without bail.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: In 1880 a law was enacted by the Legislature declaring that\r\n\"no person shall be deemed ineligible to serve as any school officer,\r\nor to vote at any school meeting, by reason of sex, who has the other\r\nqualifications now required by law.\"\r\n\r\nIt was the undoubted intention to give School Suffrage to all women by\r\nthis law, but at once Attorney-General Hamilton Ward rendered a\r\ndecision that it did not apply to cities but only to places where\r\nseparate \"school meetings\" were held, mainly country districts and\r\nvillages.\r\n\r\nIn 1881 another attempt was made by the Legislature to confer School\r\nSuffrage on all women by striking out the word \"male\" in an old\r\nstatute of 1864, but as it failed to amend the very portion of the law\r\nwhich referred to School Commissioners, this left the condition\r\nunchanged.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the Legislature tried it again by enlarging the qualifications\r\nof voters, but as the words \"school district\" were used it did not\r\nsucceed in giving the suffrage to any women except those who already\r\npossessed it.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 the Legislature once more came boldly to the rescue, and\r\nundertook to enact that women should have a vote for _District_ School\r\nCommissioners, which would bring under its provisions all the women of\r\nthe State. The Act read: \"All persons without regard to sex, who are\r\neligible to the office of School Commissioner, and have the other\r\nqualifications required by law, shall have the right to vote for\r\nSchool Commissioner.\"\r\n\r\nAs the Act of 1880 had said specifically that \"no person shall be\r\ndeemed ineligible to serve as any school officer by reason of sex,\"\r\nthis seemed to settle the question. The Act further provided that \"All\r\npersons so entitled to vote for School Commissioner shall be\r\nregistered as provided by law for those who vote for county officers,\r\nand whenever School Commissioners are to be elected it shall be the\r\nduty of the county clerk to prepare a ballot to be used exclusively by\r\nthose who, by reason of sex, can vote only for School Commissioner.\"\r\n\r\nThis Act went into effect in April, 1893, and in the autumn Mrs.\r\nMatilda Joslyn Gage registered in Manlius, Onondaga County.\r\nImmediately the board of inspectors were requested to remove her name\r\nfrom the registry. They refused and application was made to the\r\nSupreme Court to strike off her name, on the sole contention that she\r\nwas not a lawful voter on account of her sex. The application was\r\ngranted on the ground that the Act conferring upon women the right to\r\nvote for School Commissioner was unconstitutional. The inspectors\r\nobeyed the order. Mrs. Gage appealed to the General Term, where the\r\norder was affirmed, and then she carried her case to the Court of\r\nAppeals. The decision here was in brief that a School Commissioner is\r\na _county officer_, and that by the State constitution only male\r\ncitizens may vote for such officers. The decision closed by saying: \"A\r\nConstitutional Convention may take away the barrier which excludes the\r\nclaimed right of the appellant, but until that is done we must enforce\r\nthe law as it stands.\"[395]\r\n\r\nThus after twenty years of time, four acts of the Legislature and\r\nthree decisions of the highest courts, the School Suffrage for women\r\nis still confined exclusively to those of the villages and country\r\ndistricts. The law condensed reads as follows:\r\n\r\n     Every person of full age residing in any school district, etc.,\r\n     who owns or hires real property in such district liable to\r\n     taxation for school purposes; and every such resident who is the\r\n     parent of a child who shall have attended the school in said\r\n     district for a period of at least eight weeks within one year\r\n     preceding such school meeting; and every such person, not being\r\n     the parent, who shall have permanently residing with him or her a\r\n     child of school age, etc.; and every such resident and citizen as\r\n     aforesaid, who owns any personal property, assessed on the last\r\n     preceding assessment-roll of the town, exceeding $50 in value,\r\n     exclusive of such as is exempt from execution, and no other,\r\n     shall be entitled to vote at any school meeting held in such\r\n     district, for all school district officers and upon all matters\r\n     which may be brought before said meeting. No person shall be\r\n     deemed ineligible to vote at any such school district meeting, by\r\n     reason of sex, who has one or more of the other qualifications\r\n     required by this section.[396]\r\n\r\nThis was the only suffrage granted to women until 1901, when the\r\nfollowing was enacted by the Legislature:\r\n\r\n     A woman who possesses the qualifications to vote for village or\r\n     town officers, except the qualification of sex, and who is the\r\n     owner of property in the town or village assessed upon the last\r\n     preceding assessment-roll thereof, is entitled to vote upon a\r\n     proposition to raise money by tax or assessment.\r\n\r\nThis law is believed to include about 1,800 places. The bill for it\r\nwas managed by a committee of the State Suffrage Association in three\r\nsuccessive Legislatures.\r\n\r\nBy the city charters of eleven of the thirty-six third-class\r\ncities--Amsterdam, Cohoes, Corning, Geneva, Ithaca, Jamestown,\r\nNewburg, Niagara Falls, North Tonawanda, Oswego and Watertown,\r\ntaxpaying women have a vote on special appropriations. Hornellsville\r\nalso conferred this privilege but it was declared illegal by the\r\ncorporation council, because the word \"resident\" was used instead of\r\n\"citizen.\"\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: By a statute of 1880 women are eligible for any school\r\noffice. The State Superintendent of Public Instruction is elected by\r\nthe Legislature. Instead of county superintendents, as in most States,\r\nNew York has District Commissioners. A district may comprise either a\r\npart or the whole of a county, but no city may form any part of it. At\r\npresent ten women are serving as District Commissioners. A\r\nconsiderable number sit on the school boards of cities and villages\r\nbut no exact record is kept. In Greater New York thirty women serve as\r\nschool inspectors; there are also four supervisors in the departments\r\nof sewing, cooking, kitchen-garden and physical culture, at salaries\r\nranging from $2,000 to $2,500.\r\n\r\nThe same law which enables women to serve as District School\r\nCommissioners makes them eligible to all district offices, including\r\nthose of trustee, collector, treasurer and librarian, as the law in\r\nprescribing qualification, omits the word \"male.\"[397]\r\n\r\nWomen also are eligible to the office of village clerk. They serve as\r\nnotaries public, clerks of the Surrogate Court and deputy tax\r\ncollectors. Miss Christine Ross of New York City is a certified public\r\naccountant and auditor.\r\n\r\nMost cities have police matrons. Sixty fill this position in Greater\r\nNew York at a salary of $1,000 per annum.\r\n\r\nWomen are employed as city physicians in several places. The law\r\nrequires one woman physician in each State hospital for the insane and\r\neleven are at present employed, leaving only the State Homeopathic\r\nHospital at Gowanda[398] and the Manhattan Hospital on Long Island\r\nwithout one.\r\n\r\nOne woman trustee is required on the board of every State institution\r\nwhere women are placed as patients, paupers or criminals, but this is\r\nnot strictly obeyed. A list of the boards of eleven hospitals shows\r\ntwelve women and sixty-five men, but four have no women members. Two\r\nwomen are on the board of Craig Colony of Epileptics; three on that of\r\nthe Custodial Asylum for Feeble-Minded.\r\n\r\nThe following are serving as State officials: On State Board of\r\nCharities of twelve commissioners, one woman, with thirteen employed\r\nin different departments at from $480 to $1,400 per annum; State\r\nSuperintendent Woman's Relief Corps, at $1,500; two State hospital\r\naccountants at $1,400, three at $700; principal of House of Refuge for\r\nWomen at Hudson, $1,200; superintendent Western House of Refuge,\r\n$1,200; five in Commission of Lunacy Department, $700 to $1,400;\r\nfourteen in the State Library, $50 to $175 per month; seven in\r\nAdministrative Department of the Board of Regents of the University of\r\nNew York, and thirteen in the College and High School Departments (not\r\nteachers), $720 to $1,200 per annum; ten in Home Education Department,\r\n$50 to $150 per month; in the Department of Public Instruction, five\r\nconfidential clerks at from $900 to $2,000; in Bureau of Examinations\r\nseven women at $900 (men in same positions receive $1,800); in State\r\nMuseum one woman at $600; in Training Class Bureau two women clerks at\r\n$900; three women in office of Secretary of State at $900; one index\r\nclerk in Bureau of Charitable Institutions at $1,050; one in State\r\nComptroller's office at $1,050; one examiner for Civil Service\r\nCommission at $900 (men receive $1,400 for same work), and three\r\nstenographers at $600 to $900; two State's prison stenographers at\r\n$1,000; a Bertillon indexer, $1,200; one clerk for Commission of\r\nLabor, $1,200; one for Free Employment Bureau, $900; under\r\nSuperintendent of Insurance, five women, $1,200 to $1,400; in office\r\nof State Architect three, $626 to $900; in Bureau of Records two\r\nclerks, $1,200; thirteen women are Factory Inspectors or employes in\r\nthat department, $600 to $1,500; twelve in the service of Commissioner\r\nof Excise, $720 to $1,080.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen. Several are presidents of banks, a number are brokers, many are\r\ndirectors of corporations and there are women managers of countless\r\nenterprises.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The two great universities, Cornell at Ithaca and Columbia\r\nin New York City, admit women to all departments and grant them the\r\nfull degrees. In Cornell they recite in the same classes with the men\r\nstudents, and have the additional advantage of a residential hall on\r\nthe campus. There are no women on the faculty. Dr. M. Carey Thomas,\r\npresident of Bryn Mawr College, has been a member of the board of\r\ntrustees for several years. The women undergraduates of Columbia have\r\nclass-rooms and residence in Barnard, an independent corporation but\r\nan affiliated college, its dean having the same relation to Columbia\r\nas the heads of all the other colleges. The faculty is composed partly\r\nof the regular Columbia staff and partly of special professors, among\r\nwhom are a number of women. The seniors attend certain courses in\r\nphilosophy and science in the regular university classes, and all of\r\nthese are open to post graduates. The University of New York, situated\r\nin and near the city, is co-educational in its post-graduate courses\r\nand in its Departments of Law, Pedagogy and Commerce. Its Law\r\nDepartment is celebrated for the prominent women it has graduated.\r\nPratt Institute of Brooklyn is open to both sexes alike.\r\n\r\nThe Universities of Syracuse and Rochester are co-educational. The\r\nlatter was opened in 1900 through the efforts of the women of the city\r\nin raising a fund of $50,000. The project would have failed, however,\r\nhad it not been for the assistance of Miss Anthony. On the morning of\r\nthe day when the limit would expire which had been fixed by the\r\ntrustees for the raising of this sum, $8,000 were still lacking.\r\nEvery possible source had been exhausted and in despair the women\r\nappealed to Miss Anthony, who already had collected and turned over a\r\nconsiderable amount. She set out with the wonderful determination\r\nwhich always has characterized her, and at 4 o'clock in the afternoon\r\nshe went before the board of trustees with the full quota in checks\r\nand pledges, making herself responsible for the last $2,500.\r\n\r\nUnion Theological Seminary of New York City (Presbyterian) is one of\r\nthe very few orthodox institutions of this kind which admit women.\r\n\r\nThe State is distinguished by having in Vassar the first of the great\r\ncolleges for women which offer a course of study approximating that of\r\nthe best universities. It was founded in 1861. Over 700 students are\r\nin attendance.\r\n\r\nBesides seven large co-educational institutions there are eight or ten\r\nsmaller ones for boys alone and several for girls alone.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 5,405 men and 28,587 women teachers;\r\nin New York City 1,263 men and 10,949 women. The average annual salary\r\nfor teachers in the cities outside of New York is $597; in that city,\r\nwhich employs one-third of the whole number, $1,035. The average\r\nannual salary in the commissioner districts is $322.49. There are\r\nwomen in Greater New York receiving $2,500; there are hundreds in the\r\nState receiving one-tenth of that sum. So far as it has been possible\r\nto secure an estimate there is fully as much discrepancy between men's\r\nand women's salaries for the same work as in other States.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe women of Greater New York take a prominent part in political\r\ncampaigns. There are seven or eight Women's Republican Clubs, a Health\r\nProtective Association and a Woman's Municipal League which were\r\nactive in 1897 when Seth Low, president of Columbia College, was\r\ncandidate for mayor on the Reform ticket.[399] There is also a\r\nflourishing Ladies' Democratic Club.\r\n\r\nA unique observance is the annual Pilgrim Mothers' Dinner at the\r\nrenowned Waldorf-Astoria Hotel. This was instituted in December, 1892,\r\nby the New York City Suffrage League, Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake,\r\npresident, in memory of those noble women, who are apt to be\r\noverlooked at the celebrations in honor of the Pilgrim Fathers.\r\n\r\nNew York divides with Massachusetts the honor of forming the first\r\nWoman's Club--Sorosis, in 1868--and it continues foremost among the\r\nStates in the size and influence of its organizations of women. Over\r\n200, part of them suffrage societies, belong to the Federation of\r\nClubs, and these represent only a portion of the whole number. There\r\nare eighty auxiliaries to the State Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[376] The History is indebted for the material for this chapter to\r\nMrs. Mariana Wright Chapman of Brooklyn, Mrs. Jean Brooks Greenleaf of\r\nRochester, and Mrs. Lillie Devereux Blake of New York, the presidents\r\nof the State Woman Suffrage Association during the past twenty years.\r\n\r\n[377] See History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. I, p. 67.\r\n\r\n[378] Those making addresses were Miss Anthony, Miss Shaw, Mrs.\r\nChapman Catt, Mrs. Gannett, Mrs. Searing, Rabbi Max Landsberg, the\r\nHon.

Peckham, Mary Thayer Sanford, Kate\r\nStoneman, Kate S. Thompson, Emily S. Van Biele, Emilie J. Wakeman.\r\n\r\n[380] Aside from those elsewhere mentioned, the names which seem to\r\noccur most often in looking over the records are those of Dr. Sarah L.\r\nCushing, Dr. Cordelia A. Greene, Zobedia Alleman, Abigail A. Allen,\r\nKornelia T. Andrews, Amanda Alley, Mary E. Bagg, Charlotte A.\r\nCleveland, Ida K. Church, Susan Dixwell, Eliza B. Gifford, Esther\r\nHerman, Ella S.

Stebbins,\r\nJulia D. Sheppard, Chloe A. Sisson, Delia C. Taylor.\r\n\r\n[381] Much of the credit for the excellent organization is due to Miss\r\nHarriet May Mills, State organizer, daughter of C. D. B. Mills of\r\nanti-slavery record. Miss Mills is a graduate of Cornell University,\r\nand is devoting her youth and education entirely to the cause of woman\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\n[382] The story of this canvass, the largest and most systematic which\r\never has been made for such a purpose, is given in full in \"Record of\r\nthe New York Campaign of 1894,\" a pamphlet of 250 pages, issued by the\r\nState association in 1895, and placed in many libraries throughout the\r\ncountry. It is given also, with many personal touches, in the Life and\r\nWork of Susan B. Anthony, Chap. XLII.\r\n\r\n[383] From treasurer's report: Emily Howland generously contributed\r\n$1,200. That staunch friend, Sarah L. Willis of Rochester gave $720.\r\nAbby L. Pettengill of Chautauqua County, $220. Mr. and Mrs. H. S.\r\nGreenleaf of Rochester, $200. General C. T. Christiansen of Brooklyn\r\nbegan the contributions of $100, of which there were eight others from\r\nour own State--Semantha V. Lapham, Ebenezer Butterick, Mrs. H. S.\r\nHolden, Marian Skidmore, Hannah L. Howland, Cornelia H. Cary, Mr. and\r\nMrs. James Sargent; Mrs. Louisa Southworth of Ohio.\r\n\r\n[384] One who was a witness gives this description:\r\n\r\n\"There were no more dramatic scenes during the convention than those\r\nafforded by the presenting of the petitions. The names were enrolled\r\non pages of uniform size and arranged in volumes, each labeled and\r\ntied with a wide yellow ribbon and bearing the card of the member who\r\nwas to present it. At the opening of the sessions, when memorials were\r\ncalled for, he would rise and say: 'Mr. President, I have the honor to\r\npresent a memorial from Mary Smith and 17,117 others (for example),\r\nresidents of ---- county, asking that the word 'male' be stricken from\r\nthe Constitution.' Often one after another would present a bundle of\r\npetitions until it would seem as though the entire morning would be\r\nthus consumed. They were all taken by pages and heaped up on the\r\nsecretary's table, where they made an imposing appearance. Later they\r\nwere stacked on shelves in a large committee room.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. Burt, the president of the W. C. T. U., brought in the petitions\r\nof her society all at once, many great rolls of paper tied with white\r\nribbon. A colored porter took them down the aisle on a wheelbarrow.\"\r\n\r\n[385] Mesdames Cornelia K. Hood, Cornelia H. Cary, Mariana W. Chapman,\r\nMary E. Craigie, Cora Sebury, Martha R. Almy, A. E. P. Searing, Elinor\r\nEcob Morse, Marcia C. Powell, Helen G. Ecob, Susie M. Bain, Carrie E.\r\nS. Twing, Clara Neymann, Selina S. Merchant, Henrietta M. Banker,\r\nMaude S. Humphrey, Mary Lewis Gannett; Dr. Sarah H. Morris; Misses\r\nArria S. Huntington, Emily Howland, Elizabeth Burrill Curtis.\r\n\r\n[386] A hearing, on June 14, was given to the \"Antis,\" as the press\r\ndubbed the remonstrants. Their petition against being allowed the\r\nsuffrage was presented by the Hon. Elihu Root, and the speeches were\r\nmade by Francis M. Scott, the Rev. Clarence A. Walworth, the Hon.\r\nMatthew Hale and J. Newton Fiero. Letters were read from the Hon.\r\nAbram S. Hewitt and Austin Abbott.\r\n\r\n[387] Among the earnest advocates of the suffrage article were Judges\r\nTitus and Blake of New York, Judge Towns of Brooklyn, Judge Moore of\r\nPlattsburg, Messrs. Lincoln, Church and McKinstry of Chautauqua,\r\nMaybee of Sullivan, Cornwall of Yates, Powell of Kings, Cassidy of\r\nSchuyler, Kerwin of Albany, Phipps of Queens, Fraser of Washington,\r\nArnold of Dutchess, Bigelow and Campbell of New York, Roche of Troy.\r\n\r\nSpeeches in opposition were made by Messrs. McClure, Goeller and\r\nPlatzek of New York, Fuller of Chenango, Griswold of Greene, Mereness\r\nof Lewis, Sullivan of Erie, Lester of Saratoga, Hirshberg of Newburg,\r\nKellogg of Oneonta, Mantanye of Cortland, Cookinham of Utica.\r\n\r\n[388] Members of committee in favor of woman suffrage clause: Edward\r\nLauterbach, Mirabeau Lamar Towns, Vasco P. Abbott, John Bigelow,\r\nGideon J. Tucker. Opposed: William P. Goodelle, Henry J. Cookinham,\r\nJohn F. Parkhurst, Henry W. Hill, D. Gerry Wellington, John W.\r\nO'Brien, Henry W. Wiggins, Thomas G. Alvord, David McClure, De Lancy\r\nNicoll, John A. Deady, William H. Cochran.\r\n\r\n[389] In the work for other bills Mrs. Howell was assisted by Miss\r\nKate Stoneman, New York's first woman lawyer, Mrs. Sarah A. Le Boeuf,\r\nMrs. Joan Cole and Miss Winnie, all of Albany. George Rogers Howell,\r\nassistant and also State librarian, aided his wife in every way. As a\r\nState officer for many years he had strong influence and it always was\r\nused for woman's political freedom. During these years Mrs. Howell, as\r\npresident of the Albany Political Equality Club, conducted many public\r\nmeetings in the Senate Chamber of the historic old Capitol building\r\nuntil it was torn down. Legislators and State officers came each\r\nTuesday night to hear the suffrage speeches.\r\n\r\n[390] In 1860, after ten years of persistent effort by Mrs. Stanton,\r\nMiss Anthony and other pioneer workers, who had gathered up thousands\r\nof petitions and besieged the Legislature, session after session, a\r\nlaw was secured giving father and mother joint guardianship. In 1862,\r\nso quietly that the women were not aware of it, the Legislature\r\nrepealed this law and again vested the guardianship solely in the\r\nfather. Although repeated efforts were afterwards made to have the\r\nmother's right restored, this was not done for thirty years.\r\n\r\n[391] Senator Parker is a brother of Mrs. J. V. L. Pruyn, who\r\norganized the first anti-suffrage society in the State, at Albany.\r\n\r\n[392] In Senator Brown's own city of Watertown, over 50 per cent. of\r\nthe women had just voted to bond the city for a new High School, the\r\npress giving them full credit for it, but he persistently opposed this\r\nbill.\r\n\r\n[393] It was not supposed that this right could be questioned, but in\r\n1901, in New York City, a woman who was supporting her children by\r\nwashing while her husband was in the hospital, was thrown from a\r\ntrolley car with her baby in her arms and injured so that she could\r\nnot work. She brought suit against the Street Railway Company before a\r\nmunicipal court, and was awarded $147.50. The company appealed to the\r\nSupreme Court and Justice David Leaventritt reversed the decision,\r\nsaying in his opinion, \"At Common Law the husband was absolutely\r\nentitled to the earnings of his wife, and neither the Enabling Act of\r\n1860 nor the broader one of 1864 has affected the right, unless the\r\nservice and earnings were rendered and received expressly upon her\r\nsole and separate account.\" Afterwards in explanation he said that the\r\nwoman had not made it clear in her suit that she was working for\r\nherself and not performing service for her husband.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 a law was passed securing absolutely to married women their\r\nown earnings and the right to sue for damages by loss of wages in case\r\nof personal injury.\r\n\r\n[394] In 1901 an attempt was made to correct this evil, and a\r\nridiculous law was passed and duly signed by Governor Odell providing\r\nthat a couple may become husband and wife by signing an agreement\r\nbefore witnesses, but in order to make this legal it must be recorded\r\nwithin six months. If at the end of this time it has not been recorded\r\nboth are free to marry somebody else. If the fourteen year old wife\r\nshould not know of this legal requirement she may find herself\r\nabandoned without redress.\r\n\r\n[395] This decision covers many pages with hair-splitting definitions,\r\ntracing the laws governing School Commissioners back to 1843, and\r\nsumming up with the following unintentional satire.\r\n\r\n\"The Constitution, in Article 2, Section 1, prescribes the\r\nqualifications of voters 'for all officers that now are or hereafter\r\nmay be elected by _the people_,' and confines the franchise\r\nspecifically to 'male citizens.' The office of School Commissioner was\r\none thereafter made 'elective by _the people_,' through the operation\r\nof the alternative given by Article 10, Section 2, which provides that\r\n'all officers whose offices may hereafter be created by law shall be\r\nelected by _the people_ or appointed as the Legislature may direct.'\r\nThat is, in such cases, it may choose between election and appointment\r\nand in the latter event may dictate the authority and mode of\r\nappointment. The Legislature chose that the office should be elective,\r\nand, becoming such, it fell within the scope and terms of the\r\nconstitutional provisions applicable to elections by _the people_.\"\r\n\r\n[396] By the charters of the third class cities of Auburn, Geneva,\r\nHornellsville, Jamestown, Norwich, Union Springs and Watertown women\r\nhave School Suffrage on the same terms as men. The city of Kingston is\r\ndivided into several common and union free school districts and women\r\nare authorized to vote.\r\n\r\n[397] For legal opinion see Appendix for New York.\r\n\r\n[398] In 1902 the hospital at Gowanda, the largest of the kind in the\r\nState, placed a woman on its staff as specialist in gynecology.\r\n\r\n[399] In 1901, when Mr. Low was again a candidate and was elected,\r\nthese clubs were a prominent factor in the campaign. They arranged\r\nmeetings, addressed large audiences, raised $30,000 and circulated\r\n1,000,000 pieces of literature. Their work was commended by the press\r\nof the whole United States and much credit was given them for the\r\nsuccess of the Reform ticket. When the Board of Education of forty-six\r\nmembers was appointed by Mayor Low, various societies petitioned him\r\nto give women a representation upon it, but he declined to do so.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVII.\r\n\r\nNORTH CAROLINA.[400]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe only attempt at suffrage organization in North Carolina was made\r\nby Miss Helen Morris Lewis, Nov. 21, 1894. A meeting was called at the\r\ncourt house in Asheville and attended by a large audience, which was\r\naddressed by Miss Lewis and Miss Floride Cunningham. Thomas W. Patton,\r\nmayor of the city, made a stirring speech in favor of giving the\r\nballot to women. At his residence the next day a society was formed\r\nwith a membership of forty-five men and women; president, Miss Morris;\r\nvice-president, T. C. Westall; secretary, Mrs. Eleanor Johnstone\r\nCoffin; treasurer, Mayor Patton. The next mayor of Asheville, Theodore\r\nF. Davidson, also advocated woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 addresses were made in various cities by Miss Laura Clay of\r\nKentucky and Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates of Maine, who had been\r\nattending the national convention in Atlanta.\r\n\r\nLater on Miss Frances E. Willard, president of the National Woman's\r\nChristian Temperance Union, and Miss Belle Kearney, a noted lecturer\r\nfrom Mississippi, aroused considerable enthusiasm in various places by\r\npleas for woman suffrage in their temperance addresses. Miss Lewis has\r\nspoken in a number of towns and at the State Normal School. No\r\norganized work has been done, however, and but little public interest\r\nis felt.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: Early in February, 1895, as a result of\r\nthe suffrage meeting held in Asheville, a bill was presented in the\r\nLegislature to place women on school boards. Mrs. Lillie Devereux\r\nBlake of New York, a native of North Carolina, addressed the\r\nlegislators in its behalf and upon the rights of women. The bill\r\nprovoked a hot discussion but was defeated. It is impossible to obtain\r\na record of the vote.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 a bill to permit women to serve as notaries public\r\nwas defeated in the House on the ground that it would be\r\nunconstitutional, as this is a State office. The same year a bill\r\nproviding for the appointment of women physicians in the State insane\r\nasylums was referred to a committee and never reported.\r\n\r\nBills also have been presented for full suffrage and suffrage for\r\ntax-paying women, but none has been acted upon. Several Acts have been\r\npassed prohibiting employers from working women in the chain gangs on\r\nthe public roads in different counties.[401]\r\n\r\nThe most unjust discriminations against women in the property laws\r\nwere removed by the Constitutional Convention of 1868. Since then a\r\nmarried woman may acquire and hold real estate and have the enjoyment\r\nof its income and profits in her own separate right, and she may\r\ndispose of it by will subject to the husband's curtesy (the life use\r\nof the whole); but she can not sell any of it without his consent. The\r\nhusband can not sell his real estate so as to cut off the dower of the\r\nwife (the life use of one-third) without her consent.\r\n\r\nThe code of 1883 stipulates that if the husband receives the income of\r\nthe wife's separate property and she offers no objection, he can not\r\nbe made liable to account for his use of it for more than one year\r\nprevious to the date of the complaint or of her death. By an act of\r\n1889, the husband is required to list the property of the wife \"in his\r\ncontrol.\"\r\n\r\nBoth dower and curtesy obtain. If there are neither descendants nor\r\nkindred the widow is heir of the entire estate. If there are not more\r\nthan two children, and the husband die without a will, one-third of\r\nthe personal property goes to the widow; if there are more than two\r\nchildren, she shares equally with them; if there be no child or legal\r\nrepresentative of a deceased child, one-half goes to the widow, the\r\nother half to the kindred of the husband. If a wife die without a\r\nwill, the widower has a life estate in her real property, if there has\r\nbeen issue born alive, and all of her personal property absolutely,\r\nsubject to her debts.\r\n\r\nA homestead to the value of $1,000 is exempt from sale during\r\nwidowhood unless the widow have one in her own right.\r\n\r\nThe wife is not bound by contract unless the husband joins in writing.\r\nIn actions against her he must be served with the suit.\r\n\r\nThe wife can not be a sole trader without the husband's written and\r\nrecorded consent, unless living apart from him under legal divorce or\r\nseparation, or unless he is an idiot or a lunatic, or has abandoned\r\nher or maliciously turned her out of doors. She controls even her\r\nwages only under these circumstances.\r\n\r\nThe divorce laws make the discrimination against women that while the\r\nhusband can secure a divorce for one act of adultery on the part of\r\nthe wife, she can secure one from him on this ground only if he\r\nseparates from her and lives openly in adultery.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the persons and education of the\r\nminor children, and may appoint a guardian by will even for one\r\nunborn. The court appoints the guardian for the estate.\r\n\r\nWilful neglect by the husband to provide adequate support for the wife\r\nand children is a misdemeanor.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls still remains 10 years, with a\r\npenalty of death. Over 10 and under 14 the crime is a misdemeanor,\r\npunishable with fine or imprisonment in the penitentiary at discretion\r\nof the court, if the child has been previously chaste.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women possess no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: By the State constitution only those entitled to vote\r\nare eligible to office. Women are thus barred from every elective and\r\nappointive office, even that of notary public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen. They are admitted to the State Medical Society and made\r\nchairmen of various sections. There has been a revolution of public\r\nsentiment during the past twenty years in regard to women in\r\nwage-earning occupations. What formerly would have caused ostracism is\r\nnow regarded as proper and commendable.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: In 1897 the post-graduate work of the State University was\r\nopened to women. The undergraduate departments are still closed to\r\nthem. Other institutions are about equally divided among\r\nco-educational, for boys only and for girls only. The State Normal and\r\nIndustrial School for Girls (white) and the Agricultural and\r\nMechanical College for Boys (colored), both at Greensborough, offer\r\nexcellent opportunities. There are four other universities and\r\ncolleges for colored students.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 4,127 men and 4,077 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $25.07; of the women,\r\n$22.24.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[400] The History is indebted for most of the information in this\r\nchapter to Mrs. Sarah A. Russell of Wilmington, the wife of Gov.\r\nDaniel L. Russell.\r\n\r\n[401] In 1901 a bill, supported by a petition largely signed by women,\r\nwhich provided for a reformatory for youthful criminals where they\r\nmight be separated from the old and hardened, was introduced in the\r\nLegislature but never was brought to a vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LVIII.\r\n\r\nOHIO.[402]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe second Woman's Rights Convention ever held took place at Salem,\r\nOhio, in April, 1850, and such meetings were continued at intervals\r\nuntil the beginning of the Civil War. After the war a State\r\nassociation was formed, but the records of its existence are not\r\navailable. In the early summer of 1884 Mrs. Rachel S. A. Janney, whose\r\nhusband was president of the State Agricultural College (now the State\r\nUniversity), called a convention in Columbus, at which Mrs. Rosa L.\r\nSegur, Mrs. Ellen Sully Fray, Mr. and Mrs. O. G. Peters, Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Coit and family, Mrs. Ammon of Cleveland, and other\r\nwell-known advocates were present. So few were in attendance, however,\r\nthat it was thought best not to organize permanently, but Judge Ezra\r\nB. Taylor of Warren was chosen president and Mrs. Frances M. Casement,\r\nvice-president. Judge Taylor, in declining because of Congressional\r\nduties, expressed sympathy and interest in the movement. He was a\r\nmember of the Judiciary Committee of the U. S. House of\r\nRepresentatives for thirteen years, and through his influence when\r\nchairman, in 1890, a majority report in favor of a Sixteenth Amendment\r\nto the Constitution to enfranchise women was submitted to the House\r\nfor the first and last time.\r\n\r\nMrs. Casement did very efficient work, especially in the northern part\r\nof the State, and as a result a large and enthusiastic meeting was\r\nheld at Painesville, her home, in May, 1885, and a State association\r\nregularly organized. On the list of officers were placed three persons\r\nwho through all these years have made the enfranchisement of women\r\ntheir paramount work--Mrs. Casement, Mrs. Segur of Toledo and Mrs.\r\nCoit of Columbus. Mrs. Casement, who was made president, always has\r\ngiven generously of time and money and is still a member of the\r\nexecutive committee. Mrs. Segur, who was elected corresponding\r\nsecretary, also continues her activity. She does much press work and\r\nis one of the main supports of the Toledo W. S. A., which has held\r\nregular monthly meetings since its organization in 1869. Mrs. Coit was\r\nchosen treasurer and held the office fourteen years, during which she\r\nseldom missed a convention or an executive meeting. In 1900 she was\r\nmade honorary president without one dissenting vote.[403]\r\n\r\nIn addition to the State conventions from two to five executive\r\ncommittee meetings have been held yearly since 1885. Before the\r\nadoption of the biennial sessions of the Legislature, there were\r\nusually conferences at Columbus in midwinter to influence legislation,\r\nand different members remained there for weeks. Mrs. Sarah C.\r\nSchrader, Mrs. Martha H. Elwell and Mrs. Louisa Southworth rendered\r\nespecially valuable service in such matters.\r\n\r\nMrs. Southworth, in her home at Cleveland, also had charge of the\r\nsystematic enrollment of persons indorsing woman suffrage, which has\r\nbeen very effective in answering the objection that women do not want\r\nto vote. This was begun in 1888, when she was made national\r\nsuperintendent of enrollment, as she was a thorough advocate of this\r\nmethod of petition. Bills for woman suffrage introduced into the\r\nLegislature need the backing of many names, and in this way more can\r\nbe added each year. The blanks are headed: \"We believe that women\r\nshould vote on equal terms with men;\" and an effort is made to keep\r\nthe names of men and women separate. The original lists are carefully\r\npreserved, but typewritten copies for reference are made and\r\nclassified according to towns, counties and Congressional districts,\r\npains being taken each year not to register duplicates. The entire\r\nexpenses, amounting to several thousand dollars, have been borne by\r\nMrs. Southworth. All of the canvassers have contributed their\r\nservices.[404]\r\n\r\nGood educational work has been done through Woman's Day at colleges,\r\ncamp meetings and county fairs. A memorable occasion was that of the\r\nCentennial Celebration of the city of Cleveland in 1896. One day was\r\ndevoted to the consideration of the advancement of woman in\r\nphilanthropy, education, domestic science, etc. Although the speakers\r\nhad been requested not to touch upon the question of her political\r\nenfranchisement, three women indirectly mentioned it and these\r\nreceived the heartiest applause of any brought out in the course of a\r\nwhole day of able speechmaking. One of them was not permitted to\r\nretire until she acknowledged in a graceful word or two the enthusiasm\r\nof the audience. The committee having charge of this celebration asked\r\na woman in each township on the Western Reserve to gather facts in\r\nregard to its early women, and over 200 granted the request. These\r\npapers when published made four volumes of valuable information\r\nrespecting the pioneer women of this famous section of Ohio.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the Rev. Henrietta G. Moore, a Universalist minister of\r\nSpringfield, and Miss Laura A. Gregg of Kansas, visited seventeen\r\ntowns and cities in the interest of the State W. S. A. and formed\r\nnumerous organizations.\r\n\r\nA conference of national and State officers, with several public\r\nmeetings, was held at Toledo in the autumn of 1897, Mrs. Fray,\r\npresident of Lucas County, making the arrangements. The following\r\nspring Mrs. Harriet Brown Stanton of Cincinnati did the preparatory\r\nwork for a two days' meeting in that city, the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nvice-president-at-large, and Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the\r\norganization committee of the National Association, being the\r\nspeakers.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1900 Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, president of the\r\nState association, visited fifteen principal towns preparing the way\r\nfor organization, while in others plans were made by correspondence.\r\nFive persons participated in the campaign made later: Miss Shaw and\r\nMrs. Chapman Catt as speakers, each contributing two weeks of time;\r\nMiss Harriet May Mills and Miss Mary G. Hay, of New York, national\r\norganizers; Mrs. Upton accompanying the party. The object was to\r\nascertain suffrage sentiment and to organize the northwestern part of\r\nthe State. The next work was done in the southern part, Ohio women\r\nmaking the arrangements and Dr. Frances Woods of Iowa acting as\r\nspeaker and organizer. At the close of 1900 the State had twice as\r\nmany members as the year before, with vastly increased interest and\r\nactivity. This growth was due to many causes, not least among them\r\nbeing the work and inspiration of Miss Elizabeth J. Hauser, who was\r\ncorresponding secretary for five years, and for ten has scarcely\r\nmissed a convention.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: In 1888 the Legislature was asked to submit to the\r\nvoters an amendment giving Full Suffrage to women. This measure was\r\nlost, and a Municipal Suffrage Bill met a like fate.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 a bill for Full Suffrage was defeated in the Senate by 19\r\nayes, 9 noes, a three-fifths majority being required.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 a similar bill was introduced in the House and discussed at\r\nlength. It received 54 ayes, 47 noes, but not a constitutional\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 the Legislature was petitioned without result, and in 1892 and\r\n1893 School Suffrage Bills were defeated by small majorities.\r\n\r\nIt was enacted in 1893 that mayors in cities of 10,000 inhabitants and\r\nupward shall furnish proper quarters for women and female children\r\nunder arrest, and that these shall be out of sight of the rooms and\r\ncells where male prisoners are confined. The law further provides for\r\nthe appointment of police matrons.\r\n\r\nIn 1894 a Municipal Suffrage Bill was introduced but was not reported\r\nfrom committee. This year, however, School Suffrage was granted to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nTo Mrs. Caroline McCullough Everhard and Mrs. Katherine B. Claypole,\r\npresident and recording secretary of the State W. S. A., women are\r\nlargely indebted for this law. Like all reform measures, it was\r\npreceded by many discouraging defeats. In 1892 a bill was introduced\r\ninto the House by E. W. Doty, providing that women should vote for and\r\nserve as members of school boards. It was lost by seven votes,\r\nreconsidered in the adjourned session of 1893 and lost again by six\r\nvotes. Another bill was introduced into the House in January, 1894, by\r\nGustavus A. Wood, but was defeated by 47 ayes, 43 noes. Mrs. Everhard\r\nthen made an earnest appeal to Senator William T. Clark to introduce\r\nthe same bill. He promptly acceded and it passed the Senate on April\r\n10 by 20 ayes, 6 noes. It was returned to the House and passed April\r\n24 by 55 ayes, 26 noes, 11 not voting. Mr. Clark at once sent a\r\ntelegram to the president of the association: \"Woman suffrage bill a\r\nlaw; truth is mighty yet.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the Legislature was asked to enact a law making women eligible\r\nas trustees of homes and asylums for women and children. The request\r\nwas refused on the ground that the law would be declared\r\nunconstitutional because such trustees must be electors.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Free Traveling Libraries were established.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the Legislature provided that a woman could be a notary\r\npublic. Two months later the law was declared unconstitutional, as\r\nnotaries must be electors.\r\n\r\nLAWS: In 1884 a law was enacted giving a married woman the right to\r\nsue and be sued and to proceed in various other matters as if\r\nunmarried. Her personal property and real estate were liable to\r\njudgment, but she was entitled to the benefits of all exemptions to\r\nheads of families.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 married women obtained absolute control of their own property.\r\nThis act gave a wife the right to enter into any engagements or\r\ntransactions with her husband, or any other person, to hold and\r\ndispose of real and personal property and to make contracts.\r\n\r\nDower was retained but curtesy abolished, except for a man married\r\nbefore 1887 and regarding property owned by his wife before that date.\r\nEither husband or wife on the death of the other is now entitled to\r\none-third of the real estate for life. If either die without a will,\r\nand there are no children or their legal representatives living, all\r\nthe real estate passes to the survivor, and the personal property\r\nsubject to the debts. If there are children, or their legal\r\nrepresentatives, the widow or widower is entitled to one-half of the\r\nfirst $400, and to one-third of the remainder subject to distribution.\r\nA homestead not exceeding $1,000 in value may be reserved for the\r\nwidow.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 it was made legal for a married woman to act as guardian; and\r\nin 1894 as executor or administrator.\r\n\r\nBy the code of 1892 the father is legal guardian of the children and\r\nmay appoint a guardian by will, even of one unborn. If he has\r\nabandoned the mother, she has custody.\r\n\r\nThe husband must support his wife and minor children by his property\r\nor labor, but if he is unable to do so, the wife must assist as far as\r\nshe is able. The father or, when charged with maintenance thereof, the\r\nmother of a legitimate or illegitimate child under sixteen, who being\r\nable, either by reason of having means or by labor or earnings, shall\r\nneglect or refuse to provide such child with proper home, care, food\r\nand clothing; or, if said child is a legal inmate of the county or\r\ndistrict children's home, shall refuse to pay the reasonable cost of\r\nits keeping, shall upon conviction be guilty of felony and punished by\r\nimprisonment in the penitentiary for not more than three years nor\r\nless than one, or in a county jail or workhouse at hard labor for not\r\nmore than one year nor less than three months.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 12\r\nyears; in 1894 from 12 to 14; in 1896 from 14 to 16. The penalty is\r\nimprisonment not more than twenty nor less than three years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: The law of 1894 permits women, on the same terms as men, to\r\nvote for members of the boards of education (trustees), but not for\r\nState Commissioner (superintendent) nor on any question of bonds or\r\nappropriations. There are no county commissioners in Ohio.\r\n\r\nThe history of this law, after it passed into the Revised Statutes, is\r\nas follows: In December, 1894, Mrs. Ida M. Earnhart of Columbus, whose\r\nhusband, Senator M. B. Earnhart, had championed the bill, was one of\r\nthe first women to register for voting at the school election to be\r\nheld the next April. For the purpose of a test case a written request\r\nwas made of the board of elections to strike her name from the list;\r\nthey refused and suit was brought in the name of the State of Ohio\r\nagainst the board and Mrs. Earnhart. The case was argued in the\r\nCircuit Court of Franklin County in January, 1895. Mrs. Caroline\r\nMcCullough Everhard, president of the State W. S. A., attended the\r\nhearing. Senators William T. Clark and M. B. Earnhart ably defended\r\nthe law. On February 1 the decision was rendered by Judge J. G.\r\nShauck, Judges Charles G. Shearer and Gilbert H. Stewart concurring in\r\nthe opinion, which declared the law to be constitutional. The case was\r\nappealed to the Supreme Court, where the decision of the lower court\r\nwas sustained. This completed the victory which the State suffrage\r\nassociation had worked so hard to win. More than 30,000 women voted at\r\nthe first election following. In the spring of 1902, 14,800 women\r\nregistered in Cleveland and 80 per cent. voted.\r\n\r\nEverything was quiet until the winter of 1898, when the activity of\r\nthe suffragists was again called out by the introduction into the\r\nHouse of a bill by A. J. Hazlett to repeal the School Suffrage law.\r\nThe board of elections of Cleveland had asked for this. Forthwith\r\nletters were sent to all the suffrage clubs by Mrs. Everhard, and\r\nrequests were made to many prominent persons to use their influence\r\nagainst it. Protesting petitions were circulated and, with more than\r\n40,000 names, were sent to the Legislature in a very short time. On\r\nFeb. 10, 1898, members of the legislative committee of the State W. S.\r\nA. appeared before the House Committee on Elections and spoke against\r\nthe bill. Through courtesy to Mr. Hazlett, who was a member of this\r\ncommittee, it was reported back, but without recommendation, and when\r\nbrought to a vote in the House it was overwhelmingly defeated--76\r\nagainst repeal, 22 in favor.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: No woman can be elected or appointed to any office,\r\nwith the exception of that of school trustee, as the statutes provide\r\nthat all incumbents must be electors. The same law applies to the\r\nboards of all State institutions. It also prevents women from serving\r\nas notaries public.\r\n\r\nThey can act as deputies, since these are considered merely as clerks.\r\nThe law specifies that women can be Probate Court deputies because\r\nminors are eligible to that office.\r\n\r\nWomen can not be State School Commissioners, and there is no office of\r\ncounty commissioner. They are serving acceptably on the school boards\r\nof various towns and cities, but no official record is anywhere kept\r\nof the exact number.[405]\r\n\r\nA law of 1892 says: \"In all asylums for the insane there shall be\r\nemployed at least one female physician.\" There are eight such\r\ninstitutions in the State and at present only four have women\r\nphysicians.\r\n\r\nThe same year it was made mandatory on every Judge of Common Pleas to\r\nappoint in his county a board of visitors consisting of three men and\r\nthree women, whose duty it is to make periodical visits to the\r\ncorrectional and charitable institutions of the county and to act as\r\nguardians _ad litem_ to delinquent children.\r\n\r\nA law of 1893 requires police matrons in all cities of 10,000\r\ninhabitants and over. They must be more than thirty years old, of good\r\nmoral character and sound physical health, and must have the\r\nindorsement of at least ten women residents of good standing. Their\r\nsalary is fixed at not less than two-thirds of the minimum salary paid\r\nto patrolmen in the same city, and they may serve for life unless they\r\nare discharged.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Oberlin was the first co-educational college in the United\r\nStates (1833). Antioch was the second (1853). The State University and\r\nall other State institutions of learning always have been open to both\r\nsexes alike. Of the thirty-four colleges and universities twenty-seven\r\nare co-educational, five are for men and two for women. There are\r\nseventy-nine higher educational institutions other than colleges, such\r\nas academies, normal and business schools, theological seminaries,\r\netc. Of these eight are for men, ten for women, fifty-nine\r\nco-educational and two without statistics.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 10,556 men and 15,156 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $50; of the women, $40.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nOhio is one of the leading States in the number of women's clubs--289,\r\nwith a membership of 10,300, being enrolled in the General Federation.\r\nIt was principally through the efforts of this large body of women\r\nthat a bill was passed in 1896 providing for Traveling Free Libraries\r\nand 900 are now in circulation, more than in any other State. It also\r\nwas instrumental in securing a bill for the establishment of State\r\nNormal Schools in connection with Ohio and Miami Universities.\r\n\r\nThe Rookwood Pottery of Cincinnati, which has more than a national\r\nreputation, is the result of the intelligence and well directed\r\nefforts of a woman--Mrs. Maria Longworth Nichols (now Mrs. Bellamy\r\nStorer). Inspired by the Japanese display at the Centennial Exposition\r\nin Philadelphia, in 1876, she began experimenting with the clays of\r\nthe Ohio valley and eventually developed the exquisite pottery which\r\nis found in every art museum and large private collection in the\r\ncountry, and whose manufacture employs a number of skilled artists.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[402] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Harriet Taylor\r\nUpton of Warren, treasurer of the National-American Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation since 1892 and president of the State association.\r\n\r\n[403] Presidents of the State association: Frances M. Casement,\r\n1885-1888, Martha H. Elwell, 1888-1891, Caroline McCullough Everhard,\r\n1891-1898, Harriet Brown Stanton, 1898-1899, Harriet Taylor Upton,\r\n1899 and now serving.\r\n\r\nState Conventions: Painesville, 1885, Toledo, 1886, Cleveland, 1887;\r\nChillicothe, 1888, Akron, 1889, Massillon, 1890, Warren, 1891, Salem,\r\n1892, Delaware, 1893, Cincinnati, 1894, Ashtabula, 1895, Alliance,\r\n1897, Cincinnati, 1898, Akron, 1899, Athens, 1900. During the\r\nPresidential campaign of 1896, when William McKinley, a resident of\r\nOhio, was a candidate, the excitement was so intense that it was\r\nthought wise to abandon the convention, which was to have been held in\r\nOctober at Springfield.\r\n\r\n[404] When the State Suffrage Association decided to abandon this\r\nwork, Mrs. Southworth was elected State superintendent of franchise by\r\nthe W. C. T. U. and the enrollment was continued. At their national\r\nconvention, in 1901, it showed 50,000 names and aroused great\r\nenthusiasm. Of these, 9,650 were collected in the four cities of\r\nCleveland, Cincinnati, Columbus and Toledo; during the year 7,500\r\nnames had been added to the list. The system has been adopted by the\r\nunions in many States.\r\n\r\n[405] Mrs. Harriet Taylor Upton, the author of this chapter, is now\r\nserving her second term on the board of education in Warren, O. In the\r\nspring of 1898 the local political equality club determined to have\r\nsome women in this position and selected Mrs. Upton and Mrs. Carrie P.\r\nHarrington. Two vacancies having occurred, the board (which fills such\r\nvacancies) was asked to appoint them but refused. Their names\r\ntherefore were presented to the Republican caucus in the spring of\r\n1898. Instead of two candidates, as usual, there were four, as the two\r\nvacancies were to be filled for the remainder of the term. The board\r\nand the politicians still refused to recommend the women, so six names\r\nwent before the caucus. The women were asked whether they wanted to\r\nrun for the short term to fill the vacancies or for the full term of\r\nthree years. They refused to say, but simply asked that their names\r\nshould be considered. They had little hope of anything but to fill the\r\nvacancies, as the president and treasurer of the present board were\r\ncandidates for the long term. The night of the caucus was very stormy,\r\nbut the women of the city turned out in force and, with the assistance\r\nof the men, the two women were nominated for the long term. A\r\nRepublican nomination is equivalent to an election in Warren.\r\n\r\nThe board was magnanimous, both ladies were placed on committees and\r\nmost courteously treated. The next year Mrs. Upton was made chairman\r\nof the most important committee, that on supplies, buildings and\r\ngrounds, which expends nine tenths of all the money used by the board.\r\nThe other woman member was added to this committee when the new\r\ngrammar school was begun in 1899. It is considered one of the best\r\nventilated and best planned buildings in that part of the State.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1901 both were triumphantly re-elected. Mrs. Upton\r\nwas continued as chairman of her committee, and Mrs. Harrington was\r\nmade chairman of the next in importance, that on text books. [Eds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LIX.\r\n\r\nOKLAHOMA.[406]\r\n\r\n\r\nOklahoma Territory was opened to settlement April 22, 1889, and its\r\nfirst woman's organization was the Woman's Christian Temperance Union,\r\nfounded in Guthrie, March 10, 1890, by Mrs. Margaret O. Rhodes, under\r\nthe direction of Miss Frances E. Willard. In the following April a\r\nconvention was called at Oklahoma City, delegates coming from ten\r\nsocieties, and Mrs. Rhodes was elected president. In October, 1890,\r\nthe first annual convention was held in Guthrie, the capital, Mrs.\r\nAlice Williams of Missouri being the principal speaker. The first\r\nLegislature was in session and she also addressed this body making a\r\nstrong plea for legislation in favor of temperance and woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the organization\r\ncommittee of the National Suffrage Association, arranged for a\r\nlecturer to visit all the principal towns on the Rock Island and Santa\r\nFé Railroads, and Miss Laura A. Gregg of Kansas was selected for this\r\npioneer work. She came into the Territory the first week in October\r\nand lectured in twelve places, forming clubs. Her campaign closed at\r\nGuthrie where the first suffrage convention was held, November 11, 12,\r\nand an association organized. Miss Margaret Rees was elected\r\npresident,[407] Mrs. J. R. Keaton, secretary, and Mrs. R. W. Southard,\r\ndelegate to the national convention.\r\n\r\nMrs. Julia B. Nelson of Minnesota was sent into the Territory by the\r\nNational Association for three months in May, 1896. She spoke in\r\ntwenty-three towns, organizing a number of clubs, and on June 7, 8,\r\nclosed her work with a mass meeting in Guthrie.\r\n\r\nThe third convention was held in Perry, Nov. 13, 14, 1897, Mrs. Laura\r\nM. Johns of Kansas being present as the chief speaker. Mrs. Celia Z.\r\nTitus was elected president; Margaret Rees, corresponding secretary;\r\nSarah L. Bosworth, recording secretary; Eva A. Crosby, treasurer.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1898, Miss Mary G. Hay, organizer for the National\r\nSuffrage Association, arranged for a campaign, preparatory to asking\r\nthe Legislature to grant woman suffrage, as in a Territory full\r\nsuffrage can be given by legislative enactment. In October Mrs.\r\nChapman Catt came on and meetings were held in the chief towns, where\r\ncommittees were appointed to look after petitions and other necessary\r\nwork. This series of meetings closed November 6, 7, with the annual\r\nconvention in Oklahoma City. Mrs. Rhodes was elected president, Mrs.\r\nDella Jenkins, vice-president, Miss Rees continued as secretary, Mrs.\r\nMinnie D. Storm made treasurer.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: In the first Legislature, in 1890, specific work\r\nwas begun for woman suffrage. When the law regarding the franchise was\r\nunder discussion a petition was presented praying that it should read,\r\n\"Every citizen of the age of 21 shall have a right to vote,\" instead\r\nof \"every male citizen.\" A proposition for this was lost by three\r\nvotes in the House and was not considered by the Council. School\r\nSuffrage was granted to women.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 a bill asking for the enfranchisement of women was prepared by\r\nMiss Margaret Rees and introduced in the House, where it was carried\r\nby a vote of 13 yeas, 9 nays, but was killed in the Council. Mrs.\r\nJohns, who had been sent by the National Association, labored most\r\nearnestly for the bill and won hundreds of friends for the cause by\r\nher wise council and able management.\r\n\r\nAfter the suffrage convention in 1898, described above, Miss Hay\r\nreturned to New York and Miss Laura A. Gregg was appointed by the\r\nNational Association to co-operate with the Oklahoma women in securing\r\nthe franchise from the Legislature of 1899. Their efforts and the\r\nresults were thus related in the report to the National Suffrage\r\nConvention at Grand Rapids, Mich., in April, by Mrs. Chapman Catt, who\r\nhad remained in Guthrie most of the winter looking after the interests\r\nof the bill with the discretion and ability for which she is\r\ndistinguished:\r\n\r\n     Last November headquarters were opened in a business block at\r\n     Guthrie, in charge of Miss Gregg, from which an active\r\n     correspondence was conducted, resulting in a large petition and a\r\n     constant accession of new recruits. There was a most thorough\r\n     system of press work, nearly every newspaper in the Territory\r\n     aiding the movement. The strongest and best men espoused our\r\n     cause and the outlook seemed propitious. The Legislature convened\r\n     the first week in January, but an unfortunate quarrel arose\r\n     between it and the Governor which hindered legislation and\r\n     compelled our campaign to drag throughout the entire sixty days'\r\n     session. Miss Gregg continued her work at headquarters during the\r\n     winter, and Miss Hay spent a month in Guthrie looking after the\r\n     interests of our bill. It finally passed the house, 14 yeas, 10\r\n     nays, the week before the session was to close, and immediately\r\n     the opposition concentrated its efforts on the Council. However,\r\n     a majority were pledged to support our measure, and we felt\r\n     little fear.\r\n\r\n     As soon as the news spread that the bill was through the House, a\r\n     telegram was received by each member of the Council from the\r\n     Albany (N. Y.) women remonstrants. These were not all phrased\r\n     alike, but each asked the recipient: \"What can be done to defeat\r\n     the woman suffrage bill? Answer at our expense.\" At nearly the\r\n     same moment, the chief agent of the Saloonkeepers' League, an\r\n     association recently organized, as they claimed, \"to protect our\r\n     interests from unjust legislation,\" appeared upon the scene. Only\r\n     a week remained of the legislative session. Whether this agent of\r\n     the Oklahoma saloons came at the invitation of the Albany\r\n     remonstrants, or the Albany remonstrants sent their telegrams\r\n     offering assistance at the instigation of the Saloonkeepers'\r\n     League, or whether their simultaneous appearance was by chance, I\r\n     am unable to say. That they appeared together seems significant.\r\n     If they work as distinct forces, a study in the vagaries of the\r\n     human reason is presented in the motives offered to the public by\r\n     these two organizations. The Albany remonstrants would protect\r\n     the sweet womanly dignity of Oklahoma women from the debasing\r\n     influence of politics. The Saloonkeepers' League would save the\r\n     debasing influence of politics from the sweet womanly dignity of\r\n     Oklahoma women. So these Albany women, who never fail to inform\r\n     the public of their devotion to the church, join hands with the\r\n     Oklahoma saloonkeepers, who never fail to declare that the church\r\n     is a fanatical obstacle to personal liberty. A queer union it is,\r\n     but some day the world will discover the mystery which has\r\n     consummated it!\r\n\r\n     It so happened that in this Legislature there was a member who\r\n     for thirty years, in a neighboring State, had been an avowed\r\n     friend of suffrage. This was known to all Oklahoma, and even the\r\n     enemies expected him to lead our forces in the Council. This man\r\n     not only betrayed us, but headed the opposition in a\r\n     filibustering effort to keep the bill from coming to a final vote\r\n     and succeeded. Now, why did he fail us? Did he renounce the faith\r\n     of a lifetime? No. Did the suffragists offend him? No; but even\r\n     if they had done so a man of character does not change his views\r\n     in a moment for a personal whim. Why, then, this change? Any\r\n     member of the Legislature, for or against suffrage, if he would\r\n     speak as frankly to others as he did to us, would tell you it was\r\n     for money. Rumor was plentiful stating the amount and the donor.\r\n     The saloons all over Oklahoma, with a remarkable unanimity of\r\n     knowledge, boasted beforehand that the bill was killed and that\r\n     this man was the instrument which they had used, and while they\r\n     were boasting he was conferring with us and promising us his\r\n     faithful support, hoping to conduct the filibustering so adroitly\r\n     that we could not detect his hand in it....\r\n\r\n     To come to the main point, we had won the victory but a crime\r\n     robbed us of it. Suffragists know how to bear defeats with\r\n     fortitude, for each one is only a milestone showing the progress\r\n     made on a journey, but a defeat by the defection of a friend is a\r\n     new thing in the history of our movement.\r\n\r\nDr. Delos Walker of Oklahoma City was one of those who assisted in\r\nevery way possible to give the ballot to the women of the Territory.\r\nDr. C. F. McElwrath of Enid championed the bill in the House and\r\nsecured its passage over the head of every opponent. The efforts of\r\nthe women were supplemented also by those of Senator I. A. Gandey and\r\nRepresentative William H. Merten, both of Guthrie, and T. F. Hensley\r\nof El Reno, editor of the _Democrat_.\r\n\r\nLAWS: Dower and curtesy do not obtain. If either husband or wife die\r\nwithout a will, leaving only one child or the lawful issue of one\r\nchild, the survivor receives one-half of both real and personal\r\nproperty. If there is more than one child or one child and descendants\r\nof one or more deceased children, the widow or widower receives\r\none-third of the estate. If there is no issue living the survivor\r\nreceives one-half; and if there is neither issue, father, mother,\r\nbrother nor sister, the survivor takes the whole estate. A homestead\r\nmay be occupied by the widow or widower until otherwise disposed of\r\naccording to law.\r\n\r\nHusband or wife may mortgage or convey separate property without the\r\nconsent of the other.\r\n\r\nA married woman may sue and be sued and make contracts in her own\r\nname. She may carry on business as a sole trader and her earnings and\r\nwages are her sole and separate property.\r\n\r\nThe usual causes for divorce exist but only a 90 days' residence is\r\nrequired. A wife may sue for alimony without divorce. In cases where\r\nboth parties are equally at fault the court may refuse divorce but\r\nprovide for the custody and maintenance of children and equitable\r\ndivision of property.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the children. At his death the\r\nmother becomes the guardian, if a suitable person, but if she\r\nremarries the guardianship passes to the second husband.\r\n\r\nThe husband is expected to furnish a suitable support for the family,\r\nbut no punishment is prescribed for a failure to do this.\r\n\r\nNo law existed for the protection of girls until 1890 when the age was\r\nmade 14 years. In 1895 it was raised to 16 years. The penalty is first\r\ndegree (under 14), imprisonment not less than ten years; second degree\r\n(under 16), not less than five years. In both cases the girl must have\r\nbeen \"of previous chaste character.\"\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: The first Territorial Legislature (1890) granted School\r\nSuffrage to the extent of a vote for trustees.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women may hold all school offices. Eleven of the\r\ntwenty-three counties have women superintendents. They are not\r\neligible to State offices but are not prohibited by law from any\r\ncounty offices. One woman is registrar of deeds and one is deputy U.\r\nS. marshal. There are at the present time about one hundred women\r\nnotaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen. Ten hours is made a legal working day.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All educational institutions are open alike to both sexes.\r\nIn the public schools there are 914 men and 1,268 women teachers. The\r\naverage monthly salary of the men is $31.93; of the women, $26.20.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThirty Federated Clubs in Oklahoma, with over 700 members, are taking\r\nup successfully a great variety of public work. Guthrie contains eight\r\nof these, with a membership of more than one hundred, and the library\r\ncommittee has succeeded in starting a library, which has now seven\r\nhundred volumes.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[406] The History is indebted for material for this chapter to Mrs.\r\nMargaret Olive Rhodes of Guthrie, president of the Territorial Woman\r\nSuffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[407] Mrs. Rachel Rees Griffith and her two daughters are known as the\r\nMothers of Equal Suffrage in Oklahoma. Miss Margaret was the first\r\nTerritorial president, while no one has done more in the local club of\r\nGuthrie than Miss Rachel. Mrs. Griffith is nearly eighty years of age,\r\nbut fully expects to live to see the women of Oklahoma enjoying the\r\nfull franchise.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LX.\r\n\r\nOREGON.[408]\r\n\r\n\r\nAfter the defeat of the woman suffrage amendment in 1884 no organized\r\neffort was made for ten years, although quiet educational work was\r\ndone. On the Fourth of July, 1894, a meeting was called at the\r\nresidence of Mrs. Abigail Scott Duniway in Portland and a committee\r\nformed which met every week for several months thereafter. Woman's Day\r\nwas celebrated at the convention of the State Horticultural\r\nAssociation, in September, by invitation of its president, William\r\nSalloway. Addresses were made by N. W. Kinney and Mrs. Duniway, and\r\nGovernor Lord and his wife were on the platform. On October 27 a mass\r\nmeeting was held at Marquam Grand Theater, at which a State\r\norganization was effected and a constitution adopted which had been\r\nprepared by the committee.[409]\r\n\r\nIn January, 1895, the association secured from the Legislature a bill\r\nfor the submission of a woman suffrage amendment, which it would be\r\nnecessary for a second Legislature to pass upon. The annual meeting of\r\nthe State Association was held at Portland in November as quietly as\r\npossible, it being the aim to avoid arousing the two extremes of\r\nsociety, consisting of the slum classes on the one hand and the\r\nultra-conservative on the other, who instinctively pull together\r\nagainst all progress. Officers were elected as usual and the work went\r\non in persistent quietude.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1896 met in Portland, November 16.[410] Mrs.\r\nDuniway, the honorary president, was made acting president, that\r\nofficer having left the State; Mrs. H. A. Laughary, honorary\r\npresident; Dr. Annice F. Jeffreys, vice-president-at-large; Ada\r\nCornish Hertsche, vice-president; Frances E. Gotshall, corresponding\r\nsecretary; Mary Schaffer Ward, recording secretary; Mrs. A. E.\r\nHackett, assistant secretary; Jennie C. Pritchard, treasurer. These\r\nState officers were re-elected without change until November, 1898,\r\nwhen Mrs. W. H. Games was chosen recording secretary and Mrs. H. W.\r\nCoe, treasurer. In 1899, and again in 1900, Mrs. Eunice Pond Athey,\r\nformerly of Idaho, became assistant secretary.\r\n\r\nThe year 1896 was a period of continuous effort on the part of the\r\nState officers to disseminate suffrage sentiment in more or less\r\nindirect ways, so that other organizations of whatever name or nature\r\nmight look upon the proposed amendment with favor. Early in this year\r\nthe executive committee decided to organize a Woman's Congress and\r\nsecure the affiliation of all branches of women's patriotic,\r\nphilanthropic and literary work, to be managed by the suffrage\r\nassociation. It was resolved also to obtain if possible the attendance\r\nof Miss Susan B. Anthony, president of the National Association, who\r\nwas at that time in the midst of the amendment campaign in California.\r\n\r\nNever has there been a more successful public function in Oregon than\r\nthis Congress of Women, which was held the first week in June, 1896,\r\nwith Miss Anthony as its bright particular star. The love of the\r\npeople for the great leader was universally expressed, socially as\r\nwell as publicly. The speakers represented all lines of woman's\r\nwork--education, art, science, medicine, sanitation, literature, the\r\nduties of motherhood, philanthropy, reform--but sectarian and\r\npolitical questions were excluded. It was most interesting to note the\r\nclever manner in which almost all the speakers sandwiched their\r\nspeeches and papers with suffrage sentiments, and also the hearty\r\napplause which followed every allusion to the proposed amendment from\r\nthe audiences that packed the spacious Taylor Street Church to\r\noverflowing. Mrs. Sarah B. Cooper, the noted San Francisco\r\nphilanthropist, was a special attraction and made many converts to\r\nwoman suffrage by her beautiful presence and eloquent words.\r\n\r\nFor ten consecutive days in July commodious headquarters were\r\nmaintained at the Willamette Valley Chautauqua, under the supervision\r\nof the State recording secretary, Mrs. Ward. The Rev. Anna Howard Shaw\r\nDay was the most successful one of the assembly. Miss Shaw spoke as if\r\ninspired, and afterward a large reception was held in her honor.\r\n\r\nThirty-six regular meetings and four mass meetings were held by the\r\nsuffrage association during the year.\r\n\r\nThe Woman's Club movement had by this time assumed important\r\nproportions among society women, under the tactful management of that\r\nstaunch advocate of equal rights, Mrs. A. H. H. Stuart; and the\r\nsuffragists joined heartily in the new organization, which, in spite\r\nof its non-political character, strengthened the current of public\r\nopinion in behalf of the proposed amendment.\r\n\r\nThe Oregon Emergency Corps and Red Cross Society became another\r\ntacitly acknowledged auxiliary. The Oregon Pioneer Association\r\napproved the amendment by unanimous resolution, and the State Grange,\r\nthe Grand Army of the Republic, the Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion, the Good Templars, the Knights of Labor, the Printers' Union,\r\nthe Brotherhood of Locomotive Engineers and other organizations were\r\nrecognized allies.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 the second Woman's Congress took place at Portland in April\r\nunder the auspices of the executive committee of the State E. S. A.,\r\nforty affiliated societies of women participating.\r\n\r\nThe suffrage business for this year was all transacted in executive\r\nsessions, and no convention held.\r\n\r\nWoman's Day at the Willamette Valley Chautauqua in July, when forty\r\ndifferent organizations of men and women were represented, was a great\r\nsuccess. Suffrage addresses were given by Mrs. Alice Moore McComas of\r\nCalifornia, Dr. Frances Woods of Iowa, and Mrs. Games. Col. R. A.\r\nMiller, the president, himself an ardent suffragist, extended an\r\ninvitation for the following year.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Mrs. Duniway was invited by the Legislature to take part in\r\nthe joint proceedings of the two Houses in honor of forty years of\r\nStatehood.\r\n\r\nThis year, in preparation for the election at which the woman suffrage\r\namendment submitted by the Legislature of 1899 was to be voted on, 106\r\nparlor meetings were held, 30,000 pieces of literature distributed,\r\nand the names and addresses of 30,000 voters in fourteen counties\r\ncollected. Mrs. Duniway spoke by special invitation to a number of the\r\nvarious orders and fraternities of men throughout the State, most of\r\nwhom indorsed the amendment. The usual headquarters were maintained\r\nduring the Fair, under the management of Dr. Jeffreys.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: The Legislature, having changed its time of\r\nmeeting from September in the even years to January in the odd ones,\r\nconvened in 1895. Through the efforts of its leading members, a bill\r\npassed both Houses in February to submit again a woman suffrage\r\namendment to the voters. The resolution proposing it was carried\r\nwithout debate in the House by 41 ayes--including that of Speaker\r\nMoore--11 noes. In the Senate the vote was 17 ayes, 11 noes. As\r\nMrs. Abigail Scott Duniway was lecturing in Idaho, the State\r\nsuffrage association was represented at this Legislature by its\r\nvice-president-at-large, Dr. Annice F. Jeffreys.\r\n\r\nThe meeting of the Legislature of 1897 found the women ready and\r\nwaiting for the necessary ratification of the amendment; but the\r\nSolons of the non-emotional sex fell to quarreling among themselves\r\nover the United States senatorial plum and, being unable to agree on a\r\nchoice of candidates, refused to organize for any kind of business, so\r\nanother biennial period of public inactivity was enforced upon the\r\nsuffragists.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature convened in January, 1899, and with it came the\r\nlong-delayed opportunity. Mrs. Duniway and Dr. Jeffreys had charge of\r\nthe Suffrage Amendment Bill. They were recognized by prominent\r\nmembers, and admitted by vote to the privileges of the floor in each\r\nHouse. Senator C. W. Fulton, who had distinguished himself as the\r\nchampion of the amendment in 1880 and 1882, was requested by them to\r\ncarry their banner to victory once more. He assured them that\r\npersonally he was willing, but said so many bills on all sorts of\r\nside issues had been insisted upon by women that the members were not\r\nin a mood to listen to any more propositions from persons who had no\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nThe ladies did not press the matter, but for days they furnished\r\nshort, pithy letters to the papers of the capital city, answering\r\nfully all of the usual objections to woman suffrage. They also sent an\r\nopen letter to each member of the Legislature, explaining that this\r\nplea for equal rights was based wholly upon the fundamental principle\r\nof self-government, and not made in the interest of any one reform. In\r\nthis were enclosed to every Republican member Clarkson on Suffrage in\r\nColorado and Clara Barton's Appeal to Voters; to every Democrat her\r\nAppeal and some other document, taking care to keep off of partisan\r\ntoes. At length Senators Fulton and Brownell, leaders in the Upper\r\nHouse, considered the time ripe for calling up the amendment, which\r\nwas at once sent in regular order of business to the Lower House,\r\nwhere it was referred to the Judiciary Committee and--buried.\r\n\r\nFinally Senator Fulton secured a request from the Senate that the bill\r\nbe returned for further consideration, and a hearing was made a\r\nspecial order of business. The room was filled with ladies and Mrs.\r\nDuniway was asked to present the claims of the women of the State,\r\nover half of whom, through their various societies, had asked for the\r\nsubmission of the amendment. On the roll-call which followed the vote\r\nstood 25 ayes, one no.\r\n\r\nThe measure was made a special order of business in the House the same\r\nevening. The hall was crowded with spectators, Mrs. Duniway spoke ten\r\nminutes from the Speaker's desk, and the roll-call resulted in 48\r\nayes, 6 noes.\r\n\r\nA feature of the proceedings was the presentation by one of the\r\nmembers, in a long speech, of a large collection of documents sent by\r\nthe Anti-Suffrage Association of Women in New York and Massachusetts.\r\nThe preceding autumn they had sent a salaried agent, Miss Emily P.\r\nBissell of Delaware, to canvass the State against the bill.\r\n\r\nThe succeeding campaign was very largely in the nature of a \"still\r\nhunt.\" Mrs. Ida Crouch Hazlett, of Colorado, held meetings for two\r\nmonths in counties away from the railroads and did effective work\r\namong the voters of the border. Miss Lena Morrow, of Illinois, also\r\ndid good service for some time preceding election, in visiting the\r\nvarious fraternal associations of men in the city of Portland, by whom\r\nshe was generally accorded a gracious hearing. These ladies\r\nrepresented the National Association.[411]\r\n\r\nAll went well until about two weeks before election day, June 6, 1900,\r\nand the measure in all probability would have carried had it not been\r\nfor the slum vote of Portland and Astoria, which was stirred up and\r\ncalled out by the _Oregonian_, edited by H. W. Scott, the most\r\ninfluential newspaper in the State. It was the only paper, out of 229,\r\nwhich opposed the amendment. But notwithstanding its terrible\r\nonslaught, over 48 per cent. of all the votes which were cast upon the\r\namendment were in its favor. Twenty-one out of the thirty-three\r\ncounties gave handsome majorities; one county was lost by one vote,\r\none by 23 and one by 31.\r\n\r\nThe vote on the amendment in 1884 was 11,223 ayes; 28,176 noes. In\r\n1900 it stood 26,265 ayes; 28,402 noes. Although the population had\r\nmore than doubled in the cities, where the slum vote is naturally the\r\nheaviest and is always against woman suffrage, the total increase of\r\nthe \"noes\" of the State was only 226, while in the same time the\r\n\"ayes\" had been augmented by 15,042.\r\n\r\nLAWS: If either husband or wife die without a will and there are no\r\ndescendants living, all the real estate and personal property go to\r\nthe survivor. If there is issue living, the widow receives one-half of\r\nthe husband's real estate and one-half of his personal property. The\r\nwidower takes a life interest in all the wife's real estate, whether\r\nthere are children or not, and all of her personal property absolutely\r\nif there are no living descendants, half of it if there are any.\r\n\r\nAll laws have been repealed that recognize civil disabilities of the\r\nwife which are not recognized as existing against the husband, except\r\nas to voting and holding office.\r\n\r\nBy registering as a sole trader a married woman can carry on business\r\nin her own name.\r\n\r\nIn 1880 the Legislature enacted that \"henceforth the rights and\r\nresponsibilities of the parents, in the absence of misconduct, shall\r\nbe equal, and the mother shall be as fully entitled to the custody and\r\ncontrol of the children and their earnings as the father, and in case\r\nof the father's death the mother shall come into as full and complete\r\ncontrol of the children and their estate as the father does in case of\r\nthe mother's death.\"\r\n\r\nIf the husband does not support the family, the wife may apply to the\r\nCircuit Court and the Judge may issue such decree as he thinks\r\nequitable, generally conforming to that in divorce cases, and may have\r\npower to enforce its orders as in other equity cases.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 14 in 1864 and\r\nfrom 14 to 16 years in 1895. The penalty is imprisonment not less than\r\nthree nor more than twenty years. The fact that the victim was a\r\ncommon prostitute or the defendant's mistress is no excuse.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: In 1878 an Act was passed entitling women to vote for school\r\ntrustees and for bonds and appropriations for school purposes, if they\r\nhave property of their own in the school district upon which they or\r\ntheir husbands pay taxes.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women are not eligible to any elective office, except\r\nthat of school trustee.\r\n\r\nAn old law permitted women to fill the offices of State and county\r\nsuperintendents of schools, but it was contested in 1896 by a defeated\r\nmale candidate and declared unconstitutional by the Supreme Court.\r\n\r\nWomen can not sit on any State boards.\r\n\r\nThey are employed as court stenographers, and in various subordinate\r\nappointive offices. They may serve as notaries.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All the large educational institutions are open to women.\r\nIn the public schools there are 1,250 men and 2,443 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $43; of the women, $34.81.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[408] The History is indebted for the material for this chapter to\r\nMrs. Abigail Scott Duniway of Portland, honorary president of the\r\nState Equal Suffrage Association and always at the head of the\r\nmovement in Oregon.\r\n\r\n[409] Dr. Frances A.

Y., July 19, 20, 1848, and among the ablest advocates of the\r\nmeasure.[413]\r\n\r\nThe Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association was organized Dec. 22,\r\n1869, with Mary Grew as president.[414] There have been annual\r\nmeetings in or near Philadelphia regularly since that time, and large\r\nquantities of suffrage literature have been distributed.[415] In 1892\r\nMiss Grew resigned, aged 80, and was succeeded in the presidency by\r\nMrs. Lucretia L. Blankenburg, who still holds this office.\r\n\r\nThe convention of 1900 took place in Philadelphia, November 1, 2, and\r\nthe other officers elected were vice-president, Mrs. Ellen H. E.\r\nPrice; corresponding secretary, Mrs. Mary B. Luckie; recording\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Anna R. Boyd; treasurer, Mrs. Margaret B. Stone;\r\nauditors, Mrs. Mary F. Kenderdine and Mrs. Selina D. Holton. Miss Ida\r\nPorter Boyer, superintendent of press work, reported that 326\r\nnewspapers in the State, exclusive of those in Philadelphia which were\r\nsupplied by a local chairman, were using regularly the suffrage matter\r\nsent out by her bureau, and that the past year this consisted of\r\n17,150 different articles.\r\n\r\nA number of able speakers have addressed the Legislature or canvassed\r\nthe State from time to time, including Miss Susan B. Anthony and the\r\nRev. Anna Howard Shaw, president and vice-president of the National\r\nAssociation; Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the national\r\norganization committee; Henry B. Blackwell, editor of the _Woman's\r\nJournal_; Mrs. Charlotte Perkins Stetson of New York, Mrs. Mary C. C.\r\nBradford of Colorado, Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates of Maine, and Miss\r\nLaura A. Gregg of Kansas; Judge William N. Ashman, Miss Matilda\r\nHindman, Miss Boyer, Mrs. Blankenburg and Miss Jane Campbell,\r\npresident of the Philadelphia society.[416]\r\n\r\nThe latter is the largest and most influential suffrage society in the\r\nState. Previously to 1892 the Philadelphians who were identified with\r\nthe movement belonged to the Pennsylvania association. In the fall of\r\nthis year it was decided to make it a delegate body, and as that meant\r\nbarring out individual memberships, the Philadelphia members formed a\r\ncounty organization. Miss Grew was invited to lead the new society,\r\nbut feeling unable to perform the necessary duties she accepted only\r\nthe honorary presidency. It was, however, largely owing to her counsel\r\nand influence that so successful a beginning was made. After her death\r\nin 1896 the office of honorary president was abolished.\r\n\r\nThe first president of this society was Miss Campbell, who has been\r\nannually re-elected. The club has quadrupled its membership in the\r\neight years of its existence, counting only those who pay their yearly\r\ndues, and has now 400 members. It has worked in many directions;\r\ndistributed large quantities of literature; has sent speakers to\r\norganizations of women; fostered debates among the young people of\r\nvarious churches and Young Men's Literary Societies by offering prizes\r\nto those successful on the side of woman suffrage; held public\r\nmeetings in different parts of the city, which includes the whole\r\ncounty; assisted largely in the national press work, and always lent a\r\ngenerous hand to the enterprises of the National Association.[417]\r\n\r\nIn 1895 this society prepared a list of all the real and personal\r\nproperty owned by women within the city limits, which amounted to\r\n$153,757,566 real and $35,734,133 personal. These figures comprise 20\r\nper cent. of the total city tax, and all of it is without\r\nrepresentation.\r\n\r\nWith the hope of arousing suffrage sentiment, classes were formed\r\nunder the auspices of the State association to study political\r\nscience; Mrs. Susan S. Fessenden of Massachusetts was employed to\r\norganize clubs in the State; requests were sent to all the clergymen\r\nof Philadelphia to preach a sermon or give an address on Woman\r\nSuffrage; and prizes of $5, $10 and $15 were offered for the three\r\nbest essays on Political Equality for Women, fifty-six being received.\r\n\r\nA Yellow Ribbon Bazar was held in Philadelphia in 1895, the net\r\nproceeds amounting to over $1,000. Miss Mary G. Hay, Miss Yates and\r\nMiss Gregg were then employed as organizers, and were very successful\r\nin forming clubs. There are now sixteen active county societies.[418]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTIONS AND LAWS: In 1885 Miss Matilda Hindman was sent to\r\nHarrisburg to urge the Legislature to submit an amendment to the\r\nvoters striking out the word \"male\" from the suffrage clause of the\r\nState constitution. As a preliminary, 249 letters were sent to members\r\nasking their views on the subject; 89 replies were received, 53\r\nnon-committal, 20 favorable, 16 unfavorable. Miss Hindman and eleven\r\nother women appeared before a Joint Committee of Senate and House to\r\npresent arguments in favor of submitting the amendment. A bill for\r\nthis purpose passed the House, but was lost in the Senate by a vote of\r\n13 ayes, 19 noes. This was the first concerted action of the\r\nPennsylvania suffragists to influence legislation for women. A legacy\r\nof $1,390 from Mrs. Mary H. Newbold aided their efforts to secure the\r\nbill.\r\n\r\nPolitical conditions have been such that it has been considered\r\nuseless to try to obtain any legislative action on woman suffrage, and\r\nno further attempts have been made. To influence public sentiment,\r\nhowever, mass meetings addressed by the best speakers were held in the\r\nHall of the House of Representatives during the sessions of 1893, '95,\r\n'97 and '99.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 and 1899 the suffragists made strenuous attempts to secure a\r\nbill to amend the Intestate Law, which greatly discriminates against\r\nmarried women, but it was killed in committee.\r\n\r\nOwing to a gradual advance in public sentiment laws have been enacted\r\nfrom time to time protecting wage-earning women; also enlarging the\r\nproperty rights of wives, enabling them to act as incorporators for\r\nbusiness of profit, and giving them freedom to testify in court\r\nagainst their husbands under some circumstances.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 a number of influential women decided to form a corporation,\r\nwith a stock company, for the purpose of building a club house and\r\nequipping the same to rent as a business of profit. The charter was\r\nrefused, because several of the women making application were married.\r\nAfter some delay enough single women were found to take out the\r\nletters patent. When incorporated the original number organized the\r\ncompany and built the New Century Club House in Philadelphia, which\r\npaid five per cent. to stockholders the first year. One of the members\r\nof this board of directors, to save time and trouble, made application\r\nto be appointed notary public, but she was refused because the law did\r\nnot permit a woman to serve. Public attention was thus called to the\r\ninjustice of these statutes and, after much legislative tinkering,\r\nlaws were passed in 1893 giving wives the same right as unmarried\r\nwomen to \"acquire property, own, possess, control, use, lease, etc.\"\r\nThe same year women were made eligible to act as notaries public.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy both obtain. If there is issue living, the widow is\r\nentitled to one-third of the real estate for her life and one-third of\r\nthe personal property absolutely. If no issue is living, but\r\ncollateral heirs, the widow is entitled to one-half of the real\r\nestate, including the mansion house, for her life, and one-half of the\r\npersonal estate absolutely. If a wife die intestate, the widower,\r\nwhether there has been issue born alive or not, has a life interest in\r\nall her real estate and all of her personal property absolutely. If\r\nthere is neither issue nor kindred and no will the surviving husband\r\nor wife takes the whole estate.\r\n\r\nA husband may mortgage real estate, including the homestead, without\r\nthe wife's consent, but she can not mortgage even her own separate\r\nestate without his consent. Each can dispose of personal property as\r\nif single.\r\n\r\nAs a rule a married woman can not make a contract, but there are some\r\nexceptions. For instance, she can contract for the purchase of a\r\nsewing-machine for her own use. The wife must sue and be sued jointly\r\nwith the husband.\r\n\r\nA married woman must secure the privilege from the court of carrying\r\non business in her own name.\r\n\r\nThe law provides that the party found guilty of adultery can not marry\r\nthe co-respondent during the lifetime of the other party. If any\r\ndivorced woman, who shall have been found guilty of adultery, shall\r\nafterward openly cohabit with the person proved to have been the\r\npartaker of her crime, she is rendered incapable of alienating either\r\ndirectly or indirectly any of her lands, tenements or hereditaments,\r\nand all wills, deeds, and other instruments of conveyance therefor are\r\nabsolutely void, and after her death her property descends and is\r\nsubject to distribution according to law in like manner as if she had\r\ndied intestate. This latter clause does not apply to a divorced man.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1895, through the legislative committee of the State W. S.\r\nA., Mrs. Lucretia L. Blankenburg, chairman, and with the co-operation\r\nof other women's organizations, the following law, championed by\r\nRepresentative Frank Riter, was secured:\r\n\r\n     A married woman who contributes by the efforts of her own labor\r\n     or otherwise toward the support, maintenance and education of her\r\n     minor child, shall have the same and equal power, control and\r\n     authority over her said child, and the same and equal right to\r\n     the custody and services, as are now possessed by her husband who\r\n     is the father of such minor child.\r\n\r\nThe best legal authorities are undecided as to whether labor within\r\nthe household entitles the mother to this equal guardianship or\r\nwhether it must be performed outside the home. The father is held to\r\nbe the only person entitled to sue for the earnings of a minor child,\r\nand as no legal means are provided for enforcing the above law it is\r\npractically of no effect.\r\n\r\nThe law says, \"As her baron or lord, the husband is bound to provide\r\nhis wife with shelter, food, clothing and medicine;\" also:\r\n\r\n     If any husband or father neglect to maintain his wife or\r\n     children, it is lawful for any alderman, justice of the peace or\r\n     magistrate, upon information made before him, under oath or\r\n     affirmation, by the wife or children, or by any other person, to\r\n     issue his warrant for the arrest of the man, and bind him over\r\n     with one sufficient surety to appear at the next Court of Quarter\r\n     Sessions, there to answer the said charge.\r\n\r\n     If he is found to be of sufficient ability to pay such sum as the\r\n     court thinks reasonable and proper, it makes an order for the\r\n     comfortable support of wife or children, or both, the sum not to\r\n     exceed the amount of $100 per month. The man is to be committed\r\n     to jail until he complies with the order of the court, or gives\r\n     security for the payment of the sum. After three months'\r\n     imprisonment, if the court find him unable to pay or give\r\n     security, it may discharge him.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 16\r\nyears. The penalty is a fine not exceeding $1,000, and imprisonment by\r\nseparate and solitary confinement at labor, or simple imprisonment,\r\nnot exceeding fifteen years. No minimum penalty is named.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women possess no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING:[419] The State constitution of 1873 made women\r\neligible for all school offices, but they have had great difficulty in\r\nsecuring any of these. Out of 16,094 school directors in the State\r\nonly thirty-two are women. In Philadelphia a Board of Public\r\nEducation, appointed by the courts, co-operates with the school\r\ndirectors. This board consists of forty-one members, only three being\r\nwomen. In the entire State, six women are reported to be now filling\r\nthe offices of county and city school superintendent and assistant\r\nsuperintendent.\r\n\r\nIn seventeen years but sixty-seven women (in twelve counties) have\r\nbeen appointed members of the Boards of Public Charities.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 a law was passed recognizing Accounting as a profession, and\r\nMiss Mary B. Niles is now a Certified Public Accountant and Auditor.\r\n\r\nThere have been women on the Civil Service Examining Board for nurses,\r\nmatrons, etc., but there are none at present.\r\n\r\nTo Pennsylvania belongs the honor of appointing the first woman in a\r\nhospital for the insane with exclusive charge--Dr. Alice Bennett,\r\nNorristown Asylum, in 1880. Now all of the six State hospitals for the\r\ninsane employ women physicians. In Philadelphia there are five\r\nhospitals under the exclusive control of women.\r\n\r\nWomen have entire charge of the female prisoners in the Philadelphia\r\nCounty jail. Police matrons are on duty at many of the station houses\r\nin cities of the first and second class, sixteen in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nCommittees of women, officially appointed, visit all the public\r\ninstitutions of Philadelphia and Montgomery counties.\r\n\r\nDr. Frances C. Van Gasken served several years as health inspector,\r\nthe only woman to fill such an office in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nSix women are employed as State factory inspectors and receive the\r\nsame salary as the men inspectors.\r\n\r\nWithin the past ten years a large number of women have become city\r\nlibrarians through appointment by the Common Councils.\r\n\r\nMrs. Margaret Center Klingelsmith, LL.B., is librarian of the State\r\nUniversity Law School, but has been refused admission to the Academy\r\nof Law (Bar Association) of Philadelphia, although there is a strong\r\nsentiment in her favor led by George E. Nitzsche, registrar of the Law\r\nSchool.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: The only prohibited industry is mining. No professions\r\nare legally forbidden to women.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 a graduate of the Law Department of the University of\r\nPennsylvania, Mrs. Carrie Burnham Kilgore, made the fight for the\r\nadmission of women to the bar and was herself finally admitted to\r\npractice in the courts of Philadelphia. Judges William S. Pierce,\r\nWilliam N. Ashman and Thomas K. Finletter advocated this advanced\r\nstep.\r\n\r\nThere are 150 women physicians in Philadelphia alone.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: The Woman's Medical College of Philadelphia, Clara\r\nMarshall, M. D., dean, was incorporated in 1850.[420] The idea of its\r\nestablishment originated with Dr. Bartholomew Fussell, a member of\r\nthe Society of Friends. Its foundation was made possible through the\r\neffective work of Dr. Joseph S. Longshore in securing a charter from\r\nthe Legislature. Dr. Hannah Myers Longshore was a member of the first\r\ngraduating class, a pioneer among women physicians, and through her\r\nskill and devotion won high rank in her profession.[421] In 1867 the\r\nname was changed by decree of court from Female Medical College to\r\nWoman's Medical College. It is the oldest and largest medical school\r\nfor women in the world, and has nearly 1,000 alumnae, including\r\nstudents from nineteen foreign countries. The management is entirely\r\nin the hands of women.\r\n\r\nIn 1861 the Woman's Hospital was founded, mainly through the efforts\r\nof Dr. Ann Preston, to afford women the clinical opportunities denied\r\nby practically all the existing hospitals. It is now one of the\r\nlargest in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nDuring the past twenty years a number of educational institutions have\r\nbeen opened to women. Of the forty colleges and universities in the\r\nState, just one-half are co-educational; three are for women alone;\r\ntwo Catholic, one military and fourteen others are for men alone. Of\r\nthe sixteen theological seminaries, only one, the Unitarian at\r\nMeadville, admits women. They have the full privileges of the Colleges\r\nof Pharmacy and Dentistry in Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nThe principal institutions closed to women are the Jefferson Medical,\r\nHahnemann Medical, Medico-Chirurgical, Franklin and Marshall,\r\nHaverford, Lafayette, Moravian, Muhlenberg, St. Vincent, Washington\r\nand Jefferson, Waynesburg, Lehigh and most of the departments of the\r\nWestern University.\r\n\r\nIn the University of Pennsylvania (State) women are admitted on equal\r\nterms with men to the post-graduate department; as candidates for the\r\nMaster of Arts degree; and to the four years' course in biology,\r\nleading to the degree of B. S. They may take special courses in\r\npedagogy, music and interior decoration (in the Department of\r\nArchitecture) but no degree. The Medical, Dental and Veterinary\r\nDepartments are entirely closed to them. Of the large departments, Law\r\nis the only one which is fully, freely and heartily open to women on\r\nexactly the same terms as to men, and it confers the degree of LL. B.\r\nupon both alike. There are no women on the faculty, but Prof. Sara\r\nYorke Stevenson, the distinguished archoælogist, is secretary of the\r\nDepartment of Archæology and Paleontology and curator of the Egyptian\r\nand Mediterranean Section.\r\n\r\nThe Drexel Institute, founded and endowed by Anthony J. Drexel, was\r\nopened in December, 1891. Instruction is given in the arts, sciences\r\nand industries. All the departments are open to women on the same\r\nterms as to men. Booker T. Washington has a free scholarship for a\r\npupil, and one is held by the Carlisle Indian School.\r\n\r\nBryn Mawr, non-sectarian, but founded by Joseph W. Taylor, M. D., a\r\nmember of the Society of Friends, was opened in 1885. It stands at the\r\nhead of the women's colleges of the world, and ranks with the best\r\ncolleges for men. Miss M. Carey Thomas, Ph. D., LL. D., is president.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these splendid educational advantages, as late as 1891\r\nthere was no opportunity in the Philadelphia public schools for a girl\r\nto prepare for college or for a business office. In 1893 the present\r\nsuperintendent, Edward Brooks, reorganized the Girls' High School,\r\narranging a four years' classical course and a three years' business\r\ncourse.\r\n\r\nThere are in the public schools 9,360 men and 19,469 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $42.69; of the women, $38.45.\r\nIn Philadelphia the average for men is $121.93; for women, $67.61. In\r\nthis city, by decree of the board of education, the highest positions\r\nare closed to women.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPennsylvania is rich in women's clubs, 117 belonging to the State\r\nFederation. The three largest are the New Century, with 600 members;\r\nCivic, 500; New Century Guild (workingwomen), 400--all in\r\nPhiladelphia. Most of the clubs have civic departments. The suffrage\r\nsocieties have full membership in the State Federation of Clubs. The\r\nCivic and Legal Education Society of Philadelphia, composed of men and\r\nwomen, has lecture courses on national, State and municipal government\r\nand a practical knowledge of law. A study class of municipal law is\r\nconducted by Mrs. Margaret Center Klingelsmith, the law librarian of\r\nthe State University.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[412] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Lucretia\r\nLongshore Blankenburg of Philadelphia, who has been president of the\r\nState Suffrage Association since 1892.\r\n\r\n[413] See History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. I, p. 67.\r\n\r\n[414] Officers in 1884: President, Mary Grew, vice presidents, John K.\r\nWildman, Ellen M.

Campbell; recording secretary, Mrs. Olive Pond Amies;\r\ntreasurer, Mrs. Mary F. Kenderdine. Sixteen delegates were elected to\r\nrepresent the society at the State convention.\r\n\r\n[418] Among the men and women who have been especially helpful to the\r\ncause of woman suffrage since 1884, besides those already mentioned,\r\nare Robert Purvis, John M.

Hannah then took up the affairs and\r\nadministered as governor until William's death in 1717, and after that\r\ntime until her son became of age.\r\n\r\nSidney Fisher, in his account of the Pennsylvania colony, says that\r\nthis is the only instance in history where a woman has acted as\r\nProprietary Governor. Hannah Penn was skilful in her management and\r\nretained the confidence of the people through financial and political\r\nembarrassments.\r\n\r\n[420] See History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. I, p. 389.\r\n\r\n[421] Drs.

[Eds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXII.\r\n\r\nRHODE ISLAND.[422]\r\n\r\n\r\nRhode Island was one of the pioneer States to form a woman suffrage\r\nassociation. On Dec. 11, 1868, in answer to a call signed by a large\r\nnumber of its most distinguished men and women, a successful meeting\r\nwas held in Roger Williams Hall, Providence, and Mrs. Paulina Wright\r\nDavis was elected president of the new organization.[423] Many series\r\nof conventions in different parts of the State were held between 1870\r\nand 1884, at which the officers and special speakers presented\r\npetitions for signatures and prepared for legislative appeals.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, by unanimous vote of the Assembly, the State House was\r\ngranted for the first time for a woman suffrage convention. Four\r\nsessions were held in the Hall of the House of Representatives, and\r\nFrederick Douglass, Susan B. Anthony, Lucy Stone, Henry B. Blackwell,\r\nWilliam Lloyd Garrison, Mary F. Eastman and others addressed great\r\nthrongs of people who filled the seats, occupied all the standing room\r\nand overflowed into the lobbies.\r\n\r\nUp to the present date this association has held an annual convention\r\nin October, a special May Festival with social features in the spring,\r\nand from one to four meetings each intervening month. These have been\r\nrendered attractive by papers and addresses from the members and by\r\npublic speakers of ability from different parts of the United States\r\nand from other lands. In addition to this active propaganda special\r\norganizers have been secured from time to time to canvass the State\r\nand win intelligent support for the cause.\r\n\r\nThe association has had but three presidents--Paulina Wright Davis for\r\nthe first two years, Elizabeth Buffum Chace from 1870 until her death\r\nin 1899, aged ninety-two, and Ardelia C. Dewing, now serving. When\r\nMrs. Chace was unable longer to be actively the leader, Anna Garlin\r\nSpencer, who returned in 1889 to reside in Rhode Island, as first\r\nvice-president acted for her about seven years and Mrs. Dewing for the\r\nremainder of the time. Mrs. Davis was an exquisite personality with\r\nsoul ever facing the light; Mrs. Chace, a woman of granite strength\r\nand stability of character, with a keen mind always bent upon the\r\nreason and the right of things, and with a single-hearted devotion to\r\nthe great principles of life.[424]\r\n\r\nThe vice-presidents of the association number \"honorable names not a\r\nfew.\"[425] Among them was the Rev. Frederick A. Hinckley, who during\r\nthe eleven years of his ministry in Providence, 1878-1889, acted as\r\nthe first vice-president and did the greatest possible service to the\r\nassociation in all ways, ever championing the principle of equality of\r\nrights. The secretaries of the association always have been among the\r\nleaders in the movement. At first Rhoda Anna Fairbanks (Peckham) was\r\nthe single officer in that capacity. In 1872 Anna C. Garlin (Spencer)\r\nwas added as corresponding secretary but resigned in 1878 when her\r\nmarriage required her removal from the State.[426] Mrs. Ellen M.\r\nBolles served from 1891 to 1900 when Mrs. Annie M. Griffin was\r\nelected. There have been but three treasurers--Marcus T. Janes, Mrs.\r\nSusan B. P. Martin and Mrs. Mary K. Wood.[427] The chairman of the\r\nExecutive Committee has always shared the heaviest burdens. Mrs.\r\nChace was the first chairman. Mrs. S. E. H. Doyle succeeded her and\r\ncontinued in the office until her death in 1890. Mrs. Anna E. Aldrich\r\nthen served to the end of her life in 1898. The association has done a\r\ngreat deal of active work through its organizers, the brilliant and\r\nversatile Elizabeth Kittridge Churchill, Mrs. Margaret M. Campbell,\r\nMrs. Louise M. Tyler, and others. Mrs. Ellen M. Bolles, from 1890 to\r\n1898, acted as organizer as well as secretary.\r\n\r\nThe State Society affiliated with the New England Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation from the first; with the American in 1870 and with the\r\nNational-American in 1891. It was incorporated in 1892 and has been\r\nthe recipient of legacies from James Eddy, Mrs. Rachel Fry, Mrs. Sarah\r\nWilbour, Mrs. Elizabeth B. Chace and others. It raised and expended\r\nfor the woman suffrage campaign of 1887 more than $5,000 and has had\r\nsome paid worker in the field during most of the years.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: From the first year of its existence, 1869, the\r\nState Association petitioned the Legislature for an amendment to the\r\nconstitution abolishing sex as a condition of suffrage, and hearings\r\nwere held before many committees.\r\n\r\nIn 1885, through the influence of Representative Edward L. Freeman, a\r\nbill for such an amendment actually passed both Houses, but failed\r\nthrough some technicality.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 it passed both Houses again by the constitutional majority of\r\ntwo-thirds. It was necessary that it should pass two successive\r\nLegislatures, and the vote in 1887 was, Senate, 28 ayes, 8 noes;\r\nHouse, 57 ayes, 5 noes. The amendment having been published and read\r\nat the annual town and ward meetings was then submitted to the voters.\r\nIt was as follows: \"Women shall have the right to vote in the election\r\nof all civil officers and on all questions in all legal town, district\r\nor ward meetings, subject to the same qualifications, limitations and\r\nconditions as men.\"\r\n\r\nThe story of this campaign can be compressed into a few sentences, but\r\nit was a great struggle in which heroic qualities were displayed and\r\nwas led by the woman whose life has meant so much for Rhode Island,\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Buffum Chace, who had as her able lieutenant the Rev.\r\nFrederick A. Hinckley, and as her body-guard all the faithful leaders\r\nof the suffrage cause in the State and helpers from other\r\nStates.[428] Headquarters were established immediately in the business\r\ncenter of Providence. These rooms were opened each morning before nine\r\no'clock and kept open until ten at night throughout the contest. The\r\ncampaign lasted twenty-nine days, during which ninety-two public\r\nmeetings were held, some in parlors but most in halls, vestries and\r\nchurches. Miss Cora Scott Pond came at once into the State to organize\r\nthe larger public meetings and Miss Sarah J. Eddy and Mrs. C. P.\r\nNorton arranged for parlor meetings. The regular speakers were Henry\r\nB. Blackwell, William Lloyd Garrison, the Revs. C. B. Pitblado, Louis\r\nA. Banks, Frederick A. Hinckley, Ada C. Bowles; Mesdames Mary A.\r\nLivermore, J. Ellen Foster, Zerelda G. Wallace, Julia Ward Howe,\r\nKatherine Lente Stevenson, E. S. Burlingame, Adelaide A. Claflin; Miss\r\nMary F. Eastman and Miss Huldah B. Loud.[429] Miss Susan B. Anthony\r\nwas invited to make the closing speech of the campaign but declined as\r\nshe considered the situation hopeless.\r\n\r\nThe cities and towns were as thoroughly canvassed by these speakers as\r\nthe short time permitted. A special paper, _The Amendment_, was edited\r\nby Mrs. Lillie B. Chace Wyman, assisted by Miss Kate Austin and Col.\r\nJ. C. Wyman; the first number, issued March 16, an edition of 20,000,\r\nand the second, March 28, an edition of 40,000. They contained\r\nextracts from able articles on suffrage by leading men and women,\r\nletters from Rhode Island citizens approving the proposed amendment,\r\nand answers to the usual objections.\r\n\r\nThe principal newspapers of Providence, the _Journal_ and the\r\n_Telegram_, both led the opposition to the amendment, the former\r\nadmitting in an editorial, published March 10, \"the theoretic justice\r\nof the proposed amendment to the constitution conferring suffrage upon\r\nwomen,\" but hoping it would be rejected because \"whatever may be said\r\nfor it, the measure has the fatal defect of being premature and\r\nimpolitic.\" The opposition of the _Telegram_ was more aggressive and\r\neven of a scurrilous type. To offset this hostility if possible the\r\nsuffrage association hired a column of space in the _Journal_ and half\r\na column in the _Telegram_ and kept this daily filled with suffrage\r\narguments; toward the end of the campaign securing space also in the\r\n_Daily Republican_. The papers of the State generally were opposed to\r\nthe measure, but the Woonsocket _Daily Reporter_, Newport _Daily\r\nNews_, Hope Valley _Sentinel-Advertiser_, Pawtuxet Valley _Gleaner_,\r\nProvidence _People_, Bristol _Phenix_, Central Falls _Visitor_ and a\r\nfew others gave effective assistance. The association distributed\r\nabout 39,000 packages of literature to the voters.\r\n\r\nIn the Providence _Journal_ of April 4 the names of over ninety\r\nprominent voters were signed to this announcement: \"We, the\r\nundersigned, being opposed to the adoption of the proposed Woman\r\nSuffrage Amendment to the Constitution, respectfully urge all citizens\r\n(!) to vote against it at the coming election.\"\r\n\r\nThe next day the _Journal_ contained in the space paid for by the\r\nassociation the signatures of about the same number of equally\r\nprominent men appended to this statement: \"We favor the passage of the\r\nWoman Suffrage Amendment which has been submitted to the voters of\r\nRhode Island for action at the coming election.\" The same issue\r\ncontained a list of many of the most distinguished men and women in\r\nthis and other countries, beginning with Phillips Brooks and Clara\r\nBarton, and headed, \"Some Other People of Weight Who Have Indorsed\r\nWoman Suffrage. Match This if You Can.\"\r\n\r\nThe election was held April 6, 1887, and at the sixty-two polling\r\nplaces men and women were on hand to urge the electors to vote for the\r\namendment. The result was 6,889 ayes, 21,957 noes--the largest defeat\r\nwoman suffrage ever received.\r\n\r\nMany of the ablest lawyers having decided that no extension of\r\nfranchise, not even a school vote, could be secured in Rhode Island\r\nthrough the Legislature (except possibly Presidential Suffrage) and\r\nthe amendment to the constitution having been defeated by so heavy a\r\nvote, it was deemed best not to ask for another submission of the\r\nquestion for a term of years. Therefore other matters, involving\r\nlegal equality of the sexes, formed for a while the chief subjects for\r\nlegislative work.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 a special appeal was made to the General Assembly to confer\r\nupon women by statute the right to vote for presidential electors.\r\nThree hearings were had before the House committee but the bill was\r\nnot reported.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 a hearing, managed by Mrs. Jeanette S. French, was granted by\r\nthe Senate committee. A number of able women of the State made\r\naddresses and the committee reported unanimously in favor of\r\nsubmitting again an amendment for the Full Suffrage. It was too late,\r\nhowever, for further action and was referred to the May session. At\r\nthat time it passed the Senate but was lost in the House by a small\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the Governor was empowered by the General Assembly to appoint\r\na commission to revise the State constitution. This was deemed by many\r\nas opposed to the spirit of the basic law of the Commonwealth, in\r\nsubstituting a small appointive body for the Constitutional Convention\r\nof Electors previously considered necessary to revise the fundamental\r\nlaw of the State, but the commission was appointed. The Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation early presented a claim for a hearing which was granted\r\nfor May 11. The Rev. Anna Garlin Spencer conducted it and introduced\r\nthe other speakers who were all citizens of the State and of influence\r\nin their communities.[430] After interviews were held with the\r\ncommission, the association adopted resolutions which were afterwards\r\nincorporated in a letter and read by Mrs. Bolles to the Committee on\r\nRevision. It said in part:\r\n\r\n     We are informed that you consider it inadvisable to incorporate a\r\n     suffrage amendment in the revised constitution lest it endanger\r\n     the acceptance of other proposed and necessary changes. This view\r\n     may be correct, but surely it need not prevent you from advising\r\n     a provision by which the Legislature would be empowered to extend\r\n     suffrage to women at its discretion, and this we greatly desire.\r\n     A conservative measure of this nature could not call out a large\r\n     amount of antagonism from the voters, while it would be a great\r\n     help to women in their efforts to obtain a voice in such matters\r\n     of public concern as are of vital importance to their interests.\r\n     The constitution of Rhode Island is far behind the spirit of the\r\n     age in its treatment of women, as only one other State makes it\r\n     equally difficult for them to obtain even the simplest form of\r\n     political rights. In revising the fundamental law this fact ought\r\n     not to be overlooked and the instrument should be so constructed\r\n     as to bring it up to date in this respect.\r\n\r\nThese appeals were not responded to favorably by the Commission,\r\nalthough great courtesy and willingness to consider the subject were\r\nmanifested, and a large minority vote was given in the Commission\r\nitself to empower the Legislature to grant suffrage at discretion by\r\nstatute. The proposed revision was submitted to the electors and\r\nduring the campaign preceding their vote the association passed the\r\nfollowing resolution at its annual meeting of Oct. 20, 1898:\r\n\"Resolved, That we consider the proposed constitution unworthy the\r\nintelligence and civilization of the age, for these reasons: First, It\r\ndoes not give suffrage to women citizens and makes the obtaining of an\r\namendment for this purpose even more difficult than it is at present\r\nby requiring a larger legislative majority to submit any question to\r\nthe voters. Second, It restricts the suffrage of men by a property\r\nqualification.\"\r\n\r\nThe revised constitution was voted down by a large majority.\r\n\r\nLAWS: The Suffrage Association from its first existence closely\r\nwatched legislation affecting women and children, and often appeared\r\nby representative speakers before committees engaged in framing\r\nchanges in such laws; but in 1892 and '93 a special effort was made to\r\nsecure full legal equality for men and women. Miss Mary A. Greene, a\r\nRhode Island lawyer, educated for and admitted to the bar in\r\nMassachusetts, was engaged to prepare a full statement of the existing\r\nlaws relating to women and children and to draw up a code for\r\nsuggestion to the Legislature which should embody the exact justice\r\nfor which the association stood. This step was taken at that time\r\nbecause the Legislature had just appointed a Committee of Codification\r\nto consider the statutes bearing on domestic relations, contract\r\npowers, etc. The suggestions of the association, as prepared by Miss\r\nGreene, were not acted upon in any formal way, still less with\r\ncompleteness, but the changes made in the interest of equal rights for\r\nwomen were marked and the association had a distinct share in them.\r\nThe property laws for women are now satisfactory except that of\r\ninheritance which is as follows:\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy both obtain. If the husband die without a will,\r\nleaving children, the widow is entitled to the life use of one-third\r\nof the real estate, and to one-third of the personal property\r\nabsolutely, the remainder going to them. If there are no children or\r\ndescendants she takes one-half of the personal property and as much of\r\nthe real estate for life as is not required to pay the husband's\r\ndebts. The other half of the personal property goes to the husband's\r\nrelatives and, after her death, all of the real estate. The widower is\r\nentitled to a life use of all the wife's real estate if there has been\r\nissue born alive. If she die without a will he may take the whole of\r\nher personal property without administration or accountability to the\r\nchildren or to her kindred. The widow and minor children are entitled\r\nto certain articles of apparel, furniture and household supplies and\r\nto six months' support out of the estate. The widow has the prior\r\nright as administrator.\r\n\r\nThe wife may dispose of her personal and real property by will, but\r\ncan not impair the husband's curtesy, or the life use of all her real\r\nestate. The husband may do the same subject to the wife's dower, or\r\nlife use of one-third of the real estate.\r\n\r\nIf any person having neither wife nor children die without a will \"the\r\nproperty shall go to the father of such person if there be a father,\r\nif not, then to the mother, brothers and sisters.\"\r\n\r\nAll the property of a married woman, whether acquired before or after\r\nmarriage, is absolutely secured to her sole and separate use, free\r\nfrom liability for her husband's debts. Personal and real estate may\r\nbe conveyed by her as if unmarried, the latter subject to the\r\nhusband's curtesy. Her husband must present an order from her to\r\ncollect the rents and profits.\r\n\r\nA married woman may make contracts, sue and be sued, and carry on any\r\ntrade or business, and her earnings are her sole and separate\r\nproperty. She can not, however, enter into business partnership with\r\nher husband.\r\n\r\nNeither husband nor wife is liable for the torts of the other. The\r\nwife's property is liable for her debts or torts.\r\n\r\nA married woman may act as executor, administrator or guardian if\r\nappointed to those offices by will, but she can not be appointed to\r\nthem by the court except to the guardianship of children.[431]\r\n\r\nIn case of divorce for fault of the husband the wife may have dower as\r\nif he were dead. If alimony be claimed the dower is waived. If the\r\ndivorce is for the fault of the wife, the husband, if entitled to\r\ncurtesy, shall have a life estate in the lands of the wife, subject to\r\nsuch allowance to her, chargeable on the life estate, as the court may\r\ndeem proper. In case of separation only, the petitioner may be\r\nassigned a separate maintenance out of the property of the husband or\r\nwife as the case may be.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the minor children. At his death\r\nthe mother is entitled to the guardianship and custody. The mother may\r\nbe appointed guardian by the court during the husband's lifetime. If\r\nhe is insane or has deserted or neglected his children she is entitled\r\nto full custody.\r\n\r\nIf the wife is deserted by her husband unjustifiably and not supported\r\nby him, she may receive authority from the court for the custody and\r\nearnings of her minor children, and he may be imprisoned not less than\r\nsix months nor more than three years. If he abandon her and is absent\r\nfrom the State one year or more or is condemned to prison for a year\r\nor more, the court can order the income from his property applied to\r\nthe support of his family.\r\n\r\nA law of 1896 provided that a wife owning property might contract in\r\nwriting for the support of her husband and children, but this was\r\nrepealed in three months. She is not required to support them by her\r\nlabor or property, as the husband is the legal head of the family.\r\n\r\nThe most of the above laws have been enacted since 1892.\r\n\r\nUntil 1889, 10 years was the age for the protection of girls, but then\r\nit was made 14 years, with a penalty of not less than ten years'\r\nimprisonment. In 1894 it was raised to 16 and the penalty made not\r\nmore than fifteen years with no minimum number specified. The former\r\npenalty still holds, however, for actual rape.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women have no form of suffrage. The husband may vote as a\r\ntaxpayer by right of his wife's real estate.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Eligibility to office is limited by the constitution\r\nto electors. The article referring to school committee (trustees)\r\nmerely says, however, that they shall be \"residents of the town.\" In\r\n1872 and '73 the suffrage association procured by direct effort an Act\r\nqualifying women to serve on school committees and many have done so\r\nwith distinction. There are sixteen now serving in the State. The city\r\ncharter of Pawtucket requires one of the three members to be a woman.\r\n\r\nAs far back as 1869 an appeal was made by the suffrage association\r\nthat women should be placed on all boards of management of\r\ninstitutions in which women were confined as prisoners or cared for as\r\nunfortunates. In partial response an Act was passed in 1870\r\nestablishing an Advisory Board of Female Visitors to the charitable,\r\npenal and correctional institutions of the State. This board had no\r\npowers of control, but had full rights of inspection at all times and\r\nconstituted an official channel for criticism and suggestions. It is\r\nstill in existence and is composed of seven representative women.\r\n\r\nThe association was not satisfied with a board of such limited powers\r\nand in 1874 it memorialized the Legislature for an Act requiring that\r\nwomen, in the proportion of at least three out of seven, should be\r\nplaced on the State Board of Charities and Correction, with equal\r\npowers in all particulars. This petition was presented for three years\r\nsuccessively and special hearings granted to its advocates, but at\r\nlast was definitely refused. In 1891, however, two institutions, the\r\nState Home and School for Dependent Children and the Rhode Island\r\nSchool for the Deaf, were placed in charge of boards of control, to be\r\nappointed by the Governor, to report to the Legislature and to\r\nexercise full powers of supervision and management, \"at least three of\r\nwhom shall be women.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1878 a meeting was held by the association to consider the need of\r\ngood and wise women in all places where unfortunate women are in\r\nconfinement, and the matter of placing police matrons in stations was\r\ndiscussed. Agitation followed and the W. C. T. U., under the\r\nenthusiastic lead of Mrs. J. K. Barney, adopted the matter as a\r\nspecial work, the W. S. A. aiding in all possible ways. In March,\r\n1881, the first police matron in the country (it is believed) was\r\nappointed in Providence and installed as a regular officer. From this\r\nbeginning the movement spread until in 1893 an Act was passed by the\r\nGeneral Assembly, without a dissenting voice, requiring police matrons\r\nin all cities, the nominations in each to be recommended by twenty\r\nwomen residents in good standing.\r\n\r\nThe first agitation for women probation officers was started in a\r\nmeeting of the State Suffrage Association in 1892. The W. C. T. U. and\r\nthe leaders in rescue mission work in Providence continued the\r\nmovement, and in 1898 a woman was appointed in Providence to that\r\noffice, with equal powers of the man probation officer, to be\r\nresponsible for women who are released on parole.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 an Act was passed as the result of a determined movement\r\nlasting several years, in which the suffrage association shared,\r\nalthough the principal leaders were the labor reform organizations of\r\nthe State and the Council of Women of Rhode Island (to which body the\r\nW. S. A. was auxiliary). It raised the legal age of the child-worker\r\nfrom ten to twelve years, provided for sanitary conditions and moral\r\nsafeguards in shops and factories, and for the appointment of two\r\nfactory and shop inspectors, \"one of whom shall be a woman,\" to secure\r\nits enforcement. The man and woman inspector were made exactly equal\r\nin power, responsibility and salary, instead of the woman being, as in\r\nmost States, a deputy or special inspector. Mrs. Fanny Purdy Palmer\r\nwas chosen for this position.\r\n\r\nAppointive offices which women have held recently, or are holding, are\r\nassistant clerk of the Supreme Court and Court of Common Pleas;\r\nstenographer for same; clerk to State Commissioner of Public Schools;\r\nclerk to State Auditor and Insurance Commissioner; as superintendent\r\nof State Reform School for Girls, and as jailer in Kent county.\r\n\r\nNo woman has ever applied to serve as notary public, but doubtless it\r\nwould not be considered legal.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No occupation or profession is forbidden to women, but a\r\ntest is soon to be made as to whether they will be admitted to the\r\nbar. Women are prohibited from contracting to work more than ten hours\r\na day. They can bind themselves to be apprentices till the age of\r\neighteen, men until twenty-one.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Rhode Island contains only one university--Brown--founded\r\nin 1764. In 1883 Miss Helen McGill and Miss Annie S. Peck, college\r\ngraduates, addressed a meeting at Providence on the higher education\r\nof women. Arnold B. Chace was requested at this time to report at the\r\nnext regular meeting of the State Suffrage Association the prospects\r\nfor the admission of women to Brown University, as he was treasurer of\r\nthe university corporation. At a later meeting the Rev. Ezekiel Gilman\r\nRobinson, then president of the university, by request addressed the\r\nassociation and declared his views, saying in substance that he was\r\nnot in favor of their admission, especially in the undergraduate\r\ndepartments, as the discipline required by young men and women was\r\nquite different and all social questions would be complicated by the\r\npresence of the latter.\r\n\r\nAfter much discussion at other meetings it was decided to form a\r\ncommittee, representing several organizations interested in the\r\nadvancement of women, to work more definitely in this direction. On\r\nFeb. 20, 1886, a number of ladies assembled at the home of Mrs. Rachel\r\nFry, a prominent member of the suffrage association, and, after\r\ndiscussion and advice from Mr. Chace, appointed a committee.[432]\r\nThree days later it met at the home of Mrs. R. A. Peckham, organized\r\nand elected Miss Sarah E. Doyle chairman and Mrs. Fanny Purdy Palmer\r\nsecretary. It met again March 14, to hear reports on the conferences\r\nof the members with professors of the university, and the result\r\nshowed a considerable number of them in favor of the project. To\r\ninfluence public opinion the committee published statistics showing\r\nthat thirty young women of Rhode Island were attending colleges\r\noutside the State, and argued that most of these who now were \"exiles\"\r\nwould gladly receive the higher education at home.\r\n\r\nThe movement was accelerated by the act of four young girls, Elizabeth\r\nHoyt, Henrietta R. Palmer, Emma L. Meader and Helen Gregory, who took\r\nby permission the classical course in the Providence High School, at\r\nthat time limited to boys; and in 1887 addressed a petition prepared\r\nby David Hoyt, the principal, to the president of the university,\r\nurging that when their preparation was complete they might be allowed\r\nto share the educational privileges of Brown. They received a\r\ndiscouraging response and all turned to other colleges.\r\n\r\nUp to this time friends on the faculty and in the corporation of the\r\nuniversity were working up a scheme for the unofficial entrance of\r\nwomen and their instruction in the class-rooms, and the committee had\r\nengaged itself with the practical details connected with this plan.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 4, 1889, this somewhat informal committee organized an\r\nassociation and adopted a constitution which declared its object, \"to\r\nsecure the educational privileges of Brown University for women on the\r\nsame terms offered to men.\" Of the thirty-two original signers to this\r\nconstitution eighteen were members of the State Suffrage Association\r\nand the number included the president, two vice-presidents, secretary,\r\ntreasurer and four members of the executive committee. The same\r\nofficers were continued.\r\n\r\nProf. Benjamin Franklin Clarke was from the first an earnest supporter\r\nof the claims of the women, and worked within the faculty as Arnold B.\r\nChace did in the corporation. When in 1889 Elisha Benjamin Andrews\r\n(who as professor had in 1887 indorsed the woman suffrage amendment)\r\nbecame the president of the university, the cause of the higher\r\neducation of women took a great leap forward. In October, 1891, the\r\nWomen's College connected with Brown University was established and a\r\nsmall building hired for its home. Six young women, among them the now\r\ndistinguished president of Mount Holyoke College, Miss Mary Woolley,\r\nentered the class rooms. The results of the next ten years are thus\r\nsummed up in the official year-book for 1901:\r\n\r\n     The Women's College was founded in October, 1891. At first only\r\n     the privileges of university examinations and certificates of\r\n     proficiency were granted. In June, 1892, all the university\r\n     degrees and the graduate courses were opened. In November, 1897,\r\n     the institution was accepted by the corporation and officially\r\n     designated the Women's College of Brown University. The immediate\r\n     charge, subject to the direction of the president, was placed in\r\n     the hands of a dean. All instruction was required to be given by\r\n     members of the university faculty. Pembroke Hall, which was built\r\n     by the Rhode Island Society for the Collegiate Education of\r\n     Women, was formally transferred to the university in October,\r\n     1897, and was accepted as the recitation hall of the Women's\r\n     College.\r\n\r\nThe record of the admission of women to this ancient university is\r\npart of the history of the Woman Suffrage Association, because all the\r\ninitial movements were taken by that body, the society which continued\r\nthe work was separated from the association only for purposes of\r\npractical efficiency, and the first principle on which the movement\r\nproceeded was that of absolute equality in educational opportunity,\r\nwhich is the corollary of political democracy. With its actual opening\r\nto women, however, other elements of leadership assumed control and\r\nhave secured later results.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 16, 1892, the original association having practically secured\r\nits object, the money in the treasury was turned over to the Women's\r\nEducational and Industrial Union, and from that body finally found its\r\nway to a scholarship fund for the Women's College, and the association\r\ndisbanded. Later the need for raising funds to meet the requirement\r\nfor buildings and endowments led to the reorganization of the work,\r\nand the present Rhode Island Society for the Collegiate Education of\r\nWomen was formed. Miss Doyle was elected the president of this new\r\nassociation, as she had been of the old. At the dedication of Pembroke\r\nHall, which the efforts of this later society had secured, the early\r\nhistory (especially the connection of the Woman Suffrage Association\r\nwith the work) was not dwelt upon, but the facts should have permanent\r\nrecord to furnish one more proof that woman suffrage societies have\r\nstarted great collateral movements, which, when they are fully\r\nsuccessful, often forget or do not know the \"mother that bore\r\nthem.\"[433]\r\n\r\nIt was not until 1893 that the full classical course of the Providence\r\nHigh School, preparatory for the university, was officially thrown\r\nopen to girls, although a few had previously attended. Now all\r\ndepartments, including the manual training, are open alike to both\r\nsexes, and there are no distinctions anywhere in the public schools.\r\nIn these there are 207 men and 1,706 women teachers. The average\r\nmonthly salary of the men is $103.74; of the women, $51. Only one\r\nother State (Mass.) shows so great a discrepancy.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Association of Collegiate Alumnæ has an active branch in Rhode\r\nIsland. Seventeen clubs representing 1,436 members belong to the State\r\nFederation. The Local Council of Women, which is auxiliary to the\r\nNational Council, has a membership, by delegate representation, of\r\nthirty-two of the leading educational, church, philanthropic and\r\nreformatory societies of Providence and of the State. About one-half\r\nof these have men as well as women for members, but all are\r\nrepresented in the Council by women. This body has done many important\r\nthings, having taken the most active part in securing Factory and Shop\r\nInspection; initiated the formation of the Providence Society for\r\nOrganizing Charity; started the movement for a Consumers' League and\r\nlaunched that association; and is now at work to secure a State\r\ninstitution for the care and training of the Feeble-Minded. The\r\nCouncil holds from six to ten private meetings in the year, at least\r\ntwo public meetings, and an annual public Peace Celebration in\r\nconjunction with the Peace Committee of the International Council of\r\nWomen.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[422] The History is indebted for this chapter to the Rev. Anna Garlin\r\nSpencer of Providence, vice-president-at-large of the State Woman\r\nSuffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[423] See History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. III, p. 340.\r\n\r\n[424] The annual meeting in October, 1895, celebrated the completion\r\nof a quarter of a century's service on the part of Mrs. Elizabeth\r\nBuffum Chace as president of the Rhode Island Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation. Letters from absent friends were read expressing their\r\nhigh appreciation of her life-long service in the cause of humankind\r\nas well as womankind. Mrs. Julia Ward Howe, Mr. William Lloyd Garrison\r\nand Miss Mary F. Eastman attended to speak for the cause, and to\r\ntestify their love for Mrs. Chace. The Hon. E. L. Freeman, ex-Gov.\r\nJohn W. Davis and others of the State also spoke words of great\r\nrespect. The association honored itself by once more electing Mrs.\r\nChace its chief officer, although she had expressed a strong desire to\r\nretire from the position as she felt that the burden of the work\r\nshould be borne by younger shoulders.

Pierce and Rabbi David Blaustein, members of\r\nthe association, also spoke in favor of suffrage for women.\r\n\r\n[431] The right to be appointed by the court was given to married\r\nwomen by Act of 1902.\r\n\r\n[432] Mrs. Francis W. Goddard, Miss Sarah E. Doyle, principal of the\r\nGirls' High School of Providence; Mrs. M. M.

E.\r\nTucker.\r\n\r\n[433] The Suffrage Association has held one meeting in Pembroke Hall,\r\nhowever, which was presided over by its acting president and at which\r\nthe daughter of Julia Ward Howe, Mrs. Florence Howe Hall, spoke upon\r\n\"The Political Position of Women in England,\" and the use of Sayles\r\nHall of Brown University was freely granted for a series of meetings\r\nunder the auspices of the W. S. A. devoted to a presentation of\r\n\"Woman's Contribution to the Progress of the World.\" These were\r\naddressed by Abba Goold Woolson, Mary A. Livermore, Lillie Devereux\r\nBlake, Lillie Chace Wyman, Alice Stone Blackwell, Mary F. Eastman,\r\nProf. Katherine Hanscom and the Rev. Anna Garlin Spencer.\r\n\r\nIn October, 1901, Miss Susan B. Anthony addressed the students and was\r\nenthusiastically received.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIII.\r\n\r\nSOUTH CAROLINA.[434]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Mrs. Virginia Durant Young being on a visit to Mrs. Adelaide\r\nViola Neblett at Greenville, these two did so inspire each other that\r\nthen and there they held a suffrage conference with Mrs. S. Odie\r\nSirrene, Mrs. Mary Putnam Gridley and others, and pledged themselves\r\nto work for woman's enfranchisement in South Carolina.\r\n\r\nMrs. Young made a suffrage address to the Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion of Beaufort in 1891, and later spoke on the subject by\r\ninvitation at Lexington and in the Baptist church at Marion. She\r\neventually succeeded in forming a State association of 250 men and\r\nwomen who believed in equal rights, and interested themselves in\r\ncirculating literature on this question. Its officers for 1900 are\r\nMrs. Young, president; Mrs. Mary P. Prentiss, vice-president; Miss\r\nHarriet B. Manville, corresponding secretary; Mrs. Gridley, treasurer.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 Miss Susan B. Anthony, president of the National Association,\r\nMrs. Lillie Devereux Blake of New York, and Mrs. Ellen Battelle\r\nDietrick of Massachusetts, made addresses at various places, on their\r\nway home from the national convention in Atlanta. In April of this\r\nyear Miss Laura Clay of Kentucky, Miss Helen Morris Lewis of North\r\nCarolina, and Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates of Maine, with Mrs. Young and\r\nMrs. Neblett, began a suffrage campaign at Greenville. They went\r\nthence to Spartanburg, Columbia and Charleston. Here the party\r\ndivided, Miss Clay and Mrs. Young going to Georgetown, Florence,\r\nMarion, Latta, Darlington, Timmonsville and Sumter. Later Mrs.\r\nNeblett, Miss Clay and Mrs. Young spoke at Allendale, Barnwell,\r\nHampton and Beaufort.\r\n\r\nMiss Clay, auditor of the National Association, worked four months in\r\nSouth Carolina this year at her own expense. Half of the time was\r\nspent in Columbia, assisting Mrs. Young and others in the effort to\r\nhave an amendment giving suffrage to taxpaying women incorporated in\r\nthe new constitution then being framed. They had hearings before two\r\ncommittees in September, and presented their arguments to the entire\r\nConstitutional Convention in the State House, with a large number of\r\ncitizens present. The amendment failed by a vote of 26 yeas, 121 nays.\r\n\r\nPresident D. B. Johnston, of the Girls' Industrial and Normal College,\r\nand John J. McMahan, State superintendent of instruction, have done\r\nmuch to advance the educational status of women, and both believe in\r\nperfect equality of rights. Among other advocates may be mentioned the\r\nHon. Walter Hazard, Dr. William J. Young, McDonald Furman, B. Odell\r\nDuncan, George Sirrene, Col. John J. Dargan, Col. Ellison Keith, the\r\nRev. Sidi H. Brown, Col. V. P. Clayton, the Rev. John T. Morrison,\r\nSamuel G. Lawton, J. Gordon Coogler and William D. Evans, president of\r\nthe State Agricultural Society.\r\n\r\nMiss Martha Schofield, superintendent of the Colored Industrial School\r\nat Aiken, regularly enters a protest against paying taxes without\r\nrepresentation. Other women who have been devoted workers in the cause\r\nof suffrage are Miss Mary I. Hemphill, editor with her father of the\r\nAbbeville _Medium_; Mesdames Marion Morgan Buckner, Daisy P. Bailey,\r\nFlorence Durant Evans, Lillian D. Clayton, Gertrude D. Lido, Cora S.\r\nLott, Abbie Christensen, Martha Corley and Mary P. Screven; Dr. Sarah\r\nAllen; Misses Claudia G. Tharin, Iva Youmans, Annie Durant, Kate Lily\r\nBlue and Floride Cunningham.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In 1892 Mrs. Virginia Durant Young\r\npetitioned the Legislature for her personal enfranchisement, adopting\r\nthis method of presenting the arguments in a nutshell, and as \"news\"\r\nthey were widely published and commented on. At this session Gen.\r\nRobert R. Hemphill, a stanch advocate, presented a bill in the Senate\r\nto give women the franchise and the right of holding office, and\r\nbrought it to a vote on December 17; yeas, 14, nays, 21.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 numerously signed petitions for suffrage were sent to the\r\nLegislature by the women of Fairfax, Lexington and Marion. The right\r\nof petition was also frequently used by the members of the State W. C.\r\nT. U.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Mrs. Young addressed the Legislature in behalf of Presidential\r\nSuffrage for women.\r\n\r\nIn 1892, '93, '95 and '98 the laws were improved in regard to married\r\nwomen's property rights, allowing them to hold real estate\r\nindependently of their husbands, restraining husbands from collecting\r\ndebts or wages owing to their wives, and making the wife's signature\r\nnecessary to the legality of mortgage.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 was enacted by the Constitutional Convention that, \"The real\r\nand personal property of a woman, held at the time of her marriage, or\r\nthat which she may thereafter acquire, either by gift, grant,\r\ninheritance, devise or otherwise, shall be her separate property, and\r\nshe shall have all the rights incident to the same, to which an\r\nunmarried woman or a man is entitled. She shall have the power to\r\ncontract and be contracted with, in the same manner as if she were\r\nunmarried.\"\r\n\r\nDower prevails but not curtesy. If either husband or wife die without\r\na will the other has an equal claim on the property. Should there be\r\none or more children, the survivor receives one-third of the real and\r\nthe personal estate. If there are no lineal descendants, but\r\ncollateral heirs, the survivor takes one-half of the entire estate. If\r\nthere are no lineal descendants, father, mother, brother, sister,\r\nchild of such brother or sister, brother of the half-blood or lineal\r\nancestor, the survivor receives two-thirds of the estate and the other\r\nthird goes to the next of kin. If there is no kin, the survivor takes\r\nthe whole estate.\r\n\r\nA homestead to the value of $1,000 is exempted to \"the head of the\r\nfamily.\"\r\n\r\nSouth Carolina is the only State which does not allow divorce.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the children, and may appoint a\r\nguardian of their persons and property by will.\r\n\r\nThe law requires the husband to support the family, but there is no\r\neffective way for its enforcement. Any one may sell the wife\r\nnecessaries and subject the husband's property to the payment of the\r\nbills, if he does not furnish a suitable support, but he can claim his\r\nhomestead against such a debt and in many ways render this remedy\r\nunavailing.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 the \"age of protection for girls\" was raised from 10 to 14\r\nyears. The penalty is \"death, with privilege of the jury to recommend\r\nto mercy, whereupon the penalty may be reduced to imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary at hard labor during the whole lifetime of the prisoner.\"\r\n\r\nSeduction under promise of marriage is punished by a fine of not less\r\nthan $500 nor more than $5,000, or imprisonment for not less than six\r\nmonths nor more than five years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women possess no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: In the early '90's Gov. Benjamin R. Tillman secured\r\nthe election of the first woman State librarian. Ever since this\r\noffice has been filled by a woman, elected annually by the\r\nLegislature. No other elective office is open to women.\r\n\r\nA number of the engrossing clerks in the Senate are women.\r\n\r\nThrough the efforts of the W. C. T. U. there is a police matron at\r\nCharleston.\r\n\r\nDr. Sarah Allen was appointed physician in the State hospital for the\r\ninsane in 1896, and still holds the position.\r\n\r\nThere are women directors on the board of the Columbia Library\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\nWomen do not serve on the board of any State institution.\r\n\r\nThey can not be notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: Women are not permitted to practice law. No other\r\nprofession or occupation is legally forbidden to them.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: In 1894 the State University at Columbia opened its doors\r\nto women. In the same year the Medical College of Charleston admitted\r\nthem, and still later Furman University (Baptist) at Greenville. These\r\nwere direct results of the agitation for equal rights. Charleston\r\nCollege and Clemson Agricultural College are closed to women, but they\r\nmay enter the other educational institutions. Gov. Benjamin R. Tillman\r\nwas largely instrumental in securing the Girls' Industrial and Normal\r\nCollege at Rock Hill, in 1894.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 2,245 men and 2,728 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $25.18; of the women,\r\n$24.29.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[434] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Virginia D.\r\nYoung of Fairfax, owner and editor of the _Enterprise_ and president\r\nof the State Woman Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIV.\r\n\r\nTENNESSEE.[435]\r\n\r\n\r\nNo organized work for woman suffrage had been done in Tennessee up to\r\n1885, when Mrs. Elizabeth Lyle Saxon was appointed president of the\r\nState by the National Association. In 1886 she removed to Washington\r\nTerritory and Mrs. Lida A. Meriwether was made her successor. As the\r\nbest means of obtaining a hearing from people who would not attend a\r\nsuffrage meeting, Mrs. Meriwether decided to begin her work in the\r\nranks of the Woman's Christian Temperance Union. After three years of\r\nquiet effort in this organization (of which she was State president)\r\nshe succeeded in adding the \"franchise\" to its departments and having\r\na solid suffrage plank nailed into its platform by unanimous vote. In\r\nMay, 1889, she formed in Memphis the first local suffrage club, with a\r\nmembership of fifty.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1895, Miss Susan B. Anthony, president of the National\r\nAssociation, and Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of its\r\norganization committee, came to Memphis and were welcomed not only by\r\nthe suffrage society, but also by the Local Council of Women, the\r\nWoman's Club and the Nineteenth Century Club. They addressed a fine\r\naudience in the Young Men's Hebrew Association Hall.\r\n\r\nThe following June Mrs. Meriwether was employed by the National\r\nAssociation to lecture and organize for two weeks, and visited the\r\nmost important towns in the State.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1897, Miss Frances A. Griffin of Alabama made a six weeks'\r\nlecture and organizing tour under the auspices of the association,\r\nduring which she spoke in every available town of any size, Mrs.\r\nNellie E. Bergen acting as advance agent. No other organizing work\r\never has been done in Tennessee.\r\n\r\nThe first State suffrage convention was held at Nashville in May,\r\n1897, an association formed and Mrs. Meriwether unanimously elected\r\npresident. This was in fact an interstate convention, being held\r\nduring the Tennessee Centennial Exposition at the invitation of the\r\nmanaging committee, who offered the suffragists the use of the Woman's\r\nBuilding for three days to give reasons for the faith that was in\r\nthem. Delegates were present from Tennessee, Kentucky, Alabama,\r\nMississippi and Illinois. Addresses were given by Miss Laura Clay and\r\nMrs. Lida Calvert Obenchain of Kentucky, Mrs. Virginia Clay Clopton\r\nand Miss Griffin of Alabama, Miss Josephine E. Locke of Illinois, Mrs.\r\nFlora C. Huntington and Mrs. Meriwether.\r\n\r\nThe second convention took place at Memphis, April 22, 1900, Mrs.\r\nChapman Catt and Miss Mary G. Hay, national organizer, in attendance.\r\nMrs. Meriwether was elected honorary president for life; Mrs. Elise M.\r\nSelden was made president and Miss Margaret E. Henry, corresponding\r\nsecretary. On Sunday evening Mrs. Chapman Catt addressed a mass\r\nmeeting in the Grand Opera House, and the next evening spoke in the\r\naudience hall of the Nineteenth Century Club, both given free of\r\ncharge.\r\n\r\nOne incident will further show the growth of public sentiment in this\r\ndirection. In 1895 a prominent Memphis woman sent to the _Arena_ an\r\narticle entitled The Attitude of Southern Women on the Suffrage\r\nQuestion, which she claimed to be that of uncompromising opposition.\r\nIn conclusion she said: \"The views presented have been strengthened by\r\nopinions from women all over the South, from the Atlantic Coast to\r\nTexas, from the Ohio to the Gulf. More than one hundred of the\r\nhome-makers, the teachers and the writers have been consulted, all of\r\nthem recognized in their own communities for earnestness and ability.\r\nOf these, only thirteen declared themselves outright for woman\r\nsuffrage; four believed that women should vote upon property and\r\nschool questions; while nine declined to express themselves. All the\r\nothers were opposed to woman suffrage in any form.\" She then gave\r\nshort extracts from the letters of eighteen women, four in favor and\r\nfourteen opposed.\r\n\r\nThe editor wrote to Mrs. Josephine K. Henry of Kentucky asking for an\r\narticle from the other side. She sent one entitled The New Woman of\r\nthe New South, and the two were published in the _Arena_ of February,\r\n1895. Mrs. Henry gave extracts from the letters of seventy-two\r\nprominent women in various parts of the South--all uncompromising\r\nsuffragists. She had written to Mrs. Meriwether that, as her opponent\r\nwas from Tennessee, she wanted a distinct voice from that State, and\r\nrequested her to give a few reasons for desiring the suffrage and\r\nobtain the signatures of women to the same. Mrs. Meriwether supplied\r\nthe following:\r\n\r\n     We, the undersigned women of Tennessee, do and should want the\r\n     ballot because--\r\n\r\n     1. Being 21 years old, we object to being classed with minors.\r\n\r\n     2. Born in America and loyal to her institutions, we protest\r\n     against being made perpetual aliens.\r\n\r\n     3. Costing the treasuries of our counties nothing, we protest\r\n     against acknowledging the male pauper as our political superior.\r\n\r\n     4. Being obedient to law, we protest against the statute which\r\n     classes us with the convict and makes the pardoned criminal our\r\n     political superior.\r\n\r\n     5. Being sane, we object to being classed with the lunatic.\r\n\r\n     6. Possessing an average amount of intelligence, we protest\r\n     against legal classification with the idiot.\r\n\r\n     7. We taxpayers claim the right to representation.\r\n\r\n     8. We married women want to own our clothes.\r\n\r\n     9. We married breadwinners want to own our earnings.\r\n\r\n     10. We mothers want an equal partnership in our children.\r\n\r\n     11. We educated women want the power to offset the illiterate\r\n     vote of our State.\r\n\r\nMrs. Meriwether sent this \"confession of faith\" to the presidents of\r\nevery suffrage club and W. C. T. U. in Tennessee, giving them a\r\nfortnight to obtain signatures and adding, \"The King's business\r\nrequires haste.\" In two weeks it was returned with the names of 535\r\nwomen, while several presidents wrote: \"If you could only give us two\r\nweeks more we could double the number.\"[436]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTIONS AND LAWS: Dower and curtesy both obtain. The widow\r\nreceives one-third of the real estate, unless there are neither\r\ndescendants nor heirs-at-law, when she takes it all in fee-simple. Of\r\nthe personal property she takes a child's share, unless there are no\r\nlineal descendants, when she takes it all. The widower is entitled to\r\na life interest in the wife's real estate, if there has been issue\r\nborn alive, and to all of her personal estate whether there are\r\nchildren or not. The law provides that a homestead to the value of\r\n$1,000 shall inure to the widow.\r\n\r\nThe wife can neither sue nor be sued nor make contracts in her own\r\nname, unless the husband has deserted her or is insane. The husband is\r\nentitled to her earnings and savings.\r\n\r\nMeigs' Digest says: \"The general principle of the law is that marriage\r\namounts to an absolute gift to the husband of all personal goods of\r\nwhich the wife is actually or beneficially possessed at the time, or\r\nwhich come to her during coverture. So that if it be money in her\r\npocket or personal property in the hands of a third party, the title\r\nvests at once in the husband.\r\n\r\n\"By right of his marriage the husband takes an interest in his wife's\r\nreal estate, and during their joint lives the law gives him a right to\r\nthe crops, profits and products of her lands. He has the usufruct of\r\nall her freehold estate. The husband is entitled to the profits of all\r\nlands held by the wife for her life, or for the life of another.\r\n\r\n\"When a marriage is dissolved at the suit of the husband, and the\r\ndefendant is owner in her own right of lands, his right to and\r\ninterest therein and to the rents and profits of the same, shall not\r\nbe taken away or impaired, but the same shall remain to him as though\r\nthe marriage had continued. And he shall also be entitled to her\r\npersonal estate, in possession or in action, and may sue for and\r\nrecover the same in his own name.\r\n\r\n\"When the wife is forced to separate from her husband, by reason of\r\ncruel and inhuman treatment from him, she may, by a bill in equity,\r\nhave a suitable provision made for her support, out of the rents and\r\nprofits _of her land_.\"\r\n\r\nThe code says: \"A father, whether under the age of twenty-one years,\r\nor of full age, may by deed executed in his lifetime or by last will\r\nand testament in writing, from time to time and in such manner and\r\nform as he thinks fit, dispose of the custody and tuition of any\r\nlegitimate child under the age of twenty-one years and unmarried,\r\nwhether born at the time of his death or afterwards, during the\r\nminority of such child, or for a less time.\" If the father abandon the\r\nfamily the mother becomes guardian, but she can not appoint one by\r\nwill.\r\n\r\nNo law requires the husband to support wife or children.\r\n\r\nThe legal age for marriage is fourteen years for boys and twelve for\r\ngirls.\r\n\r\nBy earnest pleading and continual petitioning during the past ten\r\nyears women have secured the following: 1. The passage of a bill\r\nmaking women eligible as superintendents of county schools. 2. Police\r\nmatrons in two cities--Memphis and Knoxville. 3. A law raising the\r\n\"age of protection\" for girls from 10 to 16 years (1893), but if over\r\n12 the crime is only a misdemeanor. The penalty is, if under 12,\r\n\"death by hanging, or, in the discretion of the jury, imprisonment in\r\nthe penitentiary for life or for a period not less than ten years;\" if\r\nover 12, \"imprisonment in the penitentiary not less than three months\r\nnor more than ten years; provided no conviction shall be had on the\r\nunsupported testimony of the female ... or if the female is a bawd,\r\nlewd or kept female.\" (1895.)\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women possess no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Women are not eligible to any elective office except\r\nthat of county superintendent of schools, which was provided for by\r\nspecial statute about 1890. They can not serve as school trustees.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years all the librarians and engrossing clerks of both\r\nSenate and House have been women. They can not act as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: Women have engaged in the practice of law, but this was\r\nforbidden by a recent decision of the Supreme Court (1901). It was\r\nbased on the ground that an attorney is a public officer, and as women\r\nare not legally entitled to hold public office they can not practice\r\nlaw.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Degrees in law have been conferred upon several women at\r\nVanderbilt University, for white students, and at Fiske University,\r\nfor colored. All institutions of learning, except a few of a sectarian\r\nnature, are coeducational.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 5,019 men and 4,195 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men (estimated) is $31.88; of the\r\nwomen, $26.18.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[435] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Lida A.\r\nMeriwether of Memphis, honorary president of the State Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation.\r\n\r\n[436] Among prominent men who have aided in protective and progressive\r\nwork for women are Legislators W. H. Milburn, Thomas A. Baker and\r\nJoseph Babb; Editors G. W. Armistead of the _Issue_, Gideon Baskette\r\nof the Nashville _Banner_ and J. M. Keating of the Memphis _Appeal_;\r\nthe Revs. H. S. Williams, W. B. Evans, C. H. Wilson and T. B. Putnam;\r\nJudges E. H. East and Arthur Simpson. Among women may be mentioned\r\nMesdames E. J. Roach, Georgia Mizelle, Bettie M. Donaldson, Margaret\r\nGardner, Emily Settle, Ida T. East, Caroline Goodlett, S. E. Dosser,\r\nA. A. Gibson, Mary T. McTeer and Kate M. Simpson; Misses Louise and\r\nMary Drouillard, J. E. Baillett, M. L. Patterson and S. E. Hoyt. Lo!\r\nall these are of the faithful--and yet \"the half hath not been told.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXV.\r\n\r\nTEXAS.[437]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe first addresses in favor of woman suffrage in Texas are believed\r\nto have been given by Mrs. Mariana T. Folsom in 1885. The first\r\nattempt at organization was made on May 10, 1893, when Mrs. Rebecca\r\nHenry Hayes called a meeting in the parlors of the Grand Windsor Hotel\r\nat Dallas for the purpose of forming a State association. Fifty-two\r\nnames were enrolled; Mrs. Hayes was made president, Dr. Lawson Dabbs\r\ncorresponding secretary, and Margaret L. Watrous, recording\r\nsecretary.[438] Mrs. Sarah S. Trumbull was elected State organizer and\r\nauxiliary associations were formed in various towns. Mrs. Hayes\r\ntraveled 9,000 miles in the interest of this cause during the next two\r\nyears, but as Texas has 360 counties and a scattered and widely\r\nseparated population, organized work is very difficult.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 Mrs. Elizabeth Good Houston became president. Mrs. Alice\r\nMcAnulty served a number of years most efficiently as corresponding\r\nsecretary. Dr. Grace Danforth also did effective work. Mrs. L. A.\r\nCraig presented the question to the Democratic State Convention of\r\n1894, but without any practical result. Mrs. McAnulty and Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Fry attended the Populist State Convention the same year,\r\nbut no action was taken.\r\n\r\nSince 1887 the State W. C. T. U. has been pledged to woman suffrage.\r\nThe president, Mrs. S. C. Acheson, under whose management it was\r\nadopted, was an enthusiast upon the subject. Mrs. Fry was the first\r\nState superintendent of franchise, and, through both the W. C. T. U.\r\nand the W. S. A., has rendered valuable service. Later, Mrs. Mary E.\r\nPrendergast filled this position, distributing much literature and\r\nspeaking in many cities. Judge Davis McGee Prendergast became a\r\nconvert before his wife and convinced her of the righteousness of\r\nwoman suffrage. These two ladies are southern-born and life-long\r\nTexans.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In 1891, through the efforts of the W. C.\r\nT. U., the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 12\r\nyears. In 1895 it was raised to 15 years. The penalty is death or\r\nimprisonment in the penitentiary from not less than five years to\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nNo attempt ever has been made to secure the franchise, but at this\r\ntime (1895) the women learned that thirty of the legislators believed\r\nin woman suffrage, one of them declaring: \"If some of these seats were\r\noccupied by women, we men would do better work.\"\r\n\r\nNeither dower nor curtesy obtains. If there are any lineal descendants\r\na surviving husband or wife is entitled to a life interest in\r\none-third of the real estate and to one-third of the personal estate\r\nabsolutely; if none, to all the personal property and a life interest\r\nin one-half the real estate. If there are neither father, mother,\r\nbrothers, sisters nor their descendants, the surviving husband or wife\r\nis entitled to the whole estate, both real and personal, as to\r\nseparate property.\r\n\r\nIn addition to such provision, one-half of the community property\r\npasses to the widow or widower if there are one or more children and\r\nthe whole of such property if there are no lineal descendants. A widow\r\nor widower is also entitled to retain a homestead not exceeding $5,000\r\nin value. If either husband or wife die without a will or become\r\ninsane, and there are no living descendants, and the other party to\r\nthe marriage has no separate estate, the community property passes to\r\nthe survivor without an administration, unless there is a guardianship\r\nby the State of the insane spouse. If, however, there are descendants,\r\nthe survivor has the exclusive management of the community property. A\r\nwoman loses this right if she contract another marriage. In the event\r\nof the insane person being restored to a sound mental condition, an\r\naccounting of such property must be rendered.\r\n\r\nThe property which a woman owns at marriage, or acquires by gift,\r\ndevise or descent afterward, remains her separate estate, but passes\r\nunder the absolute control of the husband, except that he can not sell\r\nit without her consent.\r\n\r\nThe wife can not sell her separate property without the husband's\r\nconsent. He may sell his separate property without hers.\r\n\r\nHe may also sell the community property, except the homestead, without\r\nher consent.\r\n\r\nThe wife must sue and be sued jointly with her husband in regard to\r\nher separate property, and all other matters.\r\n\r\nThe wages of the wife belong to the husband as part of the community\r\nproperty, whether she is living with him or separate from him.\r\n\r\nDivorce is granted to the husband if the wife commit a single act of\r\nadultery; to the wife, only if the husband has abandoned her and lived\r\nin adultery with another. The law places the division of the property\r\nentirely in the hands of the judge, but provides that \"nothing herein\r\ncontained shall be construed to compel either party to divest himself\r\nor herself of real estate.\" Supreme Court decisions have laid down the\r\ngeneral rule that separate property shall be restored to its owner.\r\nWhere there are no children the community property may be divided as\r\nin case of death. The court, however, may make such provision as it\r\ndeems essential for the support of wife or children or an invalid\r\nhusband. If necessary it may place separate or community property in\r\nthe hands of trustees, the rents and profits to be applied to the\r\nmaintenance and education of the children or the support of the wife.\r\nThe judge assigns the children for their best interests. In general\r\npractice the mother, unless disqualified morally, retains the custody\r\nof female children of any age and of males to the age of eight, when\r\nthey are usually given to the father. There is no absolute rule, and\r\nin case of children or property an appeal may be taken to a higher\r\ncourt.\r\n\r\nThe father is the natural guardian of the persons and education of the\r\nminor children, and is entitled to be appointed guardian of their\r\nestates.\r\n\r\nThe law of support, revised in 1895, provides that \"if the husband\r\nfail to support the wife or children from the proceeds of the land\r\n_she_ may have or fail to educate the children as the fortune of the\r\n_wife_ would justify, she may in either case complain to the County\r\nCourt, which upon satisfactory proof shall decree that so much of\r\n_her_ proceeds shall be paid to the wife for the support of herself\r\nand the education of the children as the court may deem\r\nnecessary.\"[439]\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women possess no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Most of the public offices have some women on their\r\nclerical force, that of the comptroller having seven. They are paid\r\nthe same as men for the same work.\r\n\r\nWomen were postmasters of both Senate and House in the Legislature of\r\n1900, and acted as clerks of committees.\r\n\r\nThey can serve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen. They practice law and medicine, are managers of many kinds of\r\nbusiness and proprietors of hotels, and two have been presidents of\r\nbanks.\r\n\r\nMrs. Henrietta King is widely known as \"the Cattle Queen of the\r\nWorld.\" Her ranch covers a million acres, and the net proceeds of her\r\nsales of horses and cattle are estimated at $500,000 a year. A number\r\nof women own and manage ranches.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Most of the leading institutions of learning are open to\r\nboth sexes. Among these are the State University, Baylor University\r\n(Baptist), Southwestern University (Methodist South), Fort Worth\r\nPolytechnic (Methodist Episcopal), Trinity University (Cumberland\r\nPresbyterian) and Wiley University (colored). Austin College and the\r\nState Agricultural and Mechanical College are restricted to male\r\nstudents.\r\n\r\nThe State Industrial College for Girls (white) was established by the\r\nLegislature of 1900, with an appropriation of $60,000. All of the\r\nindustries will be taught, from domestic science to draughting. The W.\r\nC. T. U. and others had been petitioning for this ten years.[440]\r\n\r\nThe Prairie View State Normal School for colored youth of both sexes\r\nhas had an Industrial Department from its beginning years ago. A\r\nmovement is now on foot to establish such a department as a portion of\r\nthe public school system. Austin already has one, made possible by\r\nlegacy, and its fine results have greatly inspired the law-makers.\r\n\r\nOne woman has served as superintendent of schools at Waco, and there\r\nare many women principals of High Schools.\r\n\r\nThere are in the public schools 7,347 men and 7,672 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $49.20; of the women, $35.50.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nPractically all of the progressive steps enumerated above have been\r\ntaken since 1883. When it is remembered that less than twenty years\r\nago women were virtually ostracized if they attempted any kind of\r\noccupation outside the home, even teaching being looked upon askance,\r\nthe changes seem almost miraculous.\r\n\r\nTexas has 130 Woman's Clubs with a membership of about 3,500. With\r\nother good works they have distributed great quantities of reading\r\nmatter among isolated families. They also have established forty\r\npublic libraries and four traveling libraries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[437] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Helen M.\r\nStoddard of Fort Worth, president of the State Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union.\r\n\r\n[438] Under the direction of Dr. Dabbs a Congress of Women was held in\r\nconnection with the State Fair, and a Texas Woman's Council was\r\nformed, not committed to suffrage but progressive in its views.\r\n\r\n[439] The lawyer who was consulted as to the accuracy of these\r\nstatements said, after a careful examination: \"There are so many other\r\nlaws bearing upon each of these that all this is necessarily\r\nimperfect, but there is enough else, that is likewise true, to fill a\r\nbook.\"\r\n\r\n[440] In 1901 Mrs. Helen M. Stoddard was appointed by Gov. Joseph D.\r\nSayers a member of the committee to locate this school. The\r\nappointment was confirmed by the Senate, and the committee of twelve\r\nmen elected her secretary. She received, of course, the same pay as\r\nthe other members. Later three women were placed on the Board of\r\nRegents, herself among the number. [Eds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVI.\r\n\r\nUTAH.[441]\r\n\r\n\r\nTo write the history of woman suffrage in Utah one must turn backward\r\nto 1870, when the Legislature of the Territory passed a bill\r\nconferring the franchise upon women, to which acting-Governor S. A.\r\nMann affixed his signature February 12. From that time women voted at\r\nall elections, while some of them took a practical interest in public\r\nmatters and acted as delegates to political conventions and members of\r\nTerritorial and county committees.\r\n\r\nThe first attempt to elect a woman to any important office was made in\r\nSalt Lake City at the county convention of 1878, when Mrs. Emmeline B.\r\nWells was nominated for treasurer. She received the vote of the entire\r\ndelegation, but the statute including the word \"male\" was held to\r\ndebar women from holding political offices. A bill was presented to\r\nthe next Legislature with petitions numerously signed asking that this\r\nword be erased from the statutes, which was passed. Gov. George W.\r\nEmory, however, refused to sign it, and though other Legislatures\r\npassed similar bills by unanimous vote, none ever received his\r\nsignature or that of any succeeding governor.\r\n\r\nIn June, 1871, Mrs. Elizabeth Cady Stanton and Miss Susan B. Anthony,\r\nthe president and vice-president-at-large of the National Woman\r\nSuffrage Association, stopped at Salt Lake City on their way to the\r\nPacific Coast and met many of the prominent men and women.\r\n\r\nIn 1872 the _Woman's Exponent_ was established, and it is impossible\r\nto estimate the advantage this little paper gave to the women of this\r\nfar western Territory. From its first issue it was the champion of the\r\nsuffrage cause, and by exchanging with women's papers of the United\r\nStates and England it brought news of women in all parts of the world\r\nto those of Utah. They also were thoroughly organized in the National\r\nWoman's Relief Society, a charitable and philanthropic body which\r\nstood for reform and progress in all directions. Through such an\r\norganization it was always comparatively easy to promote any specific\r\nobject or work. The Hon. George Q. Cannon, Utah's delegate in the\r\n'70's, coming from a Territory where women had the ballot, interested\r\nhimself in the suffrage question before Congress. He thus became\r\nacquainted with the prominent leaders of the movement, who went to\r\nWashington every winter and who manifested much interest in the women\r\nafar off in possession of the rights which they themselves had been so\r\nlong and zealously advocating without apparent results. Among these\r\nwere Mrs. Stanton, Miss Anthony, Mrs. Isabella Beecher Hooker and\r\nothers of national reputation.\r\n\r\nWomen were appointed as representatives from Utah by the National\r\nSuffrage Association, and the correspondence between its officers and\r\nMrs. Wells, who had been made a member of their Advisory Committee and\r\nvice-president for the Territory, as well as the fact that the women\r\nof Utah were so progressive on the suffrage question and had sent\r\nlarge petitions asking for the passage of a Sixteenth Amendment to the\r\nFederal Constitution to enfranchise all women, resulted in an\r\ninvitation for her to attend its annual convention at Washington, in\r\nJanuary, 1879. Mrs. Wells was accompanied by Mrs. Zina Young Williams\r\nand they were cordially welcomed by Mrs. Stanton and Miss Anthony.\r\nThis was a valuable experience for these women, as, even though they\r\nhad the right of suffrage, there was much to learn from the great\r\nleaders who had been laboring in the cause of woman's enfranchisement\r\nfor more than thirty years. They were invited to address the\r\nconvention, and selected with others to go before Congressional\r\ncommittees and the President of the United States, as well as to\r\npresent important matters to the Lady of the White House. The kindness\r\nwhich they received from Mrs. Hayes and other noted women always will\r\nremain a pleasant memory of that first visit to the national capitol.\r\nOn their return home they took up the subject of the ballot more\r\nenergetically in its general sense than ever before through public\r\nspeaking and writing.\r\n\r\nDuring the seventeen years, from 1870 to 1887, that the women of Utah\r\nenjoyed the privilege of the ballot several attempts were made to\r\ndeprive them of it. In 1880 a case came before the Supreme Court of\r\nthe Territory on a mandamus requiring the assessor and registrar to\r\nerase the names of Emmeline B. Wells, Maria M. Blythe and Cornelia\r\nPaddock from the registration list, also the names of all other women\r\nbefore a certain specified date, but the court decided in favor of the\r\ndefendants.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1882 a convention was held to prepare a constitution\r\nand urge Congress to admit Utah as a State. Three women were\r\nelected--Mrs. Sarah M. Kimball, Mrs. Elizabeth Howard and Mrs.\r\nWells--and took part in framing this constitution, and their work was\r\nas satisfactory as that of the male members. Although this was a new\r\ndeparture, it caused no friction whatever and was good political\r\ndiscipline for the women, especially in parliamentary law and usage.\r\n\r\nThis year another case was brought, before the Third District Court,\r\nto test the validity of the statute conferring the elective franchise\r\nupon the women of the Territory. A registrar of Salt Lake City refused\r\nto place the names of women upon the list of voters, and Mrs. Florence\r\nL. Westcott asked for a writ compelling him to administer the oath,\r\nenter her name, etc. The case was called for argument Sept. 14, 1882,\r\nChief Justice James A. Hunter on the bench, and able lawyers were\r\nemployed on both sides of the question. The decision sustained the\r\nLegislative Act of 1870 under which women voted. Associate Justice\r\nEmerson agreed with Judge Hunter, and Associate Justice Twiss\r\nacknowledged the validity of the law, but insisted that women should\r\nbe taxpayers to entitle them to the right. This test case decided all\r\nothers and women continued to vote until the passage of the\r\nEdmunds-Tucker Law, in March, 1887. During this period women gained\r\nmuch political experience in practical matters, and their association\r\nwith men acquainted with affairs of State, in council and on\r\ncommittees gave them a still wider knowledge of the manipulation of\r\npublic affairs.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1882, the National W. S. A. held a conference in Omaha,\r\nNeb., and Mrs. Wells and Mrs. Zina D. H. Young attended. Miss Anthony,\r\nMrs. May Wright Sewall, chairman of the Executive Committee, and many\r\nother distinguished women were in attendance. Mrs. Wells, as\r\nvice-president for Utah, presented an exhaustive report of the\r\nsuffrage work in the Territory, which was received with a great deal\r\nof enthusiasm.\r\n\r\nAt the national convention in Washington the previous January the\r\nproposed disfranchisement of Utah women by the Edmunds Bill had been\r\nvery fully discussed and a resolution adopted, that \"the proposition\r\nto disfranchise the women of Utah for no cause whatever is a cruel\r\ndisplay of the power which lies in might alone, and that this Congress\r\nhas no more right to disfranchise the women of Utah than the men of\r\nWyoming.\"[442] This sympathy was gratefully acknowledged by the women\r\nof the Territory.\r\n\r\nThe suffrage women throughout the various States made vigorous\r\nprotests against the injustice of this pending measure. A committee\r\nappointed at the convention in Washington, in the winter of 1887,\r\npresented a memorial to the President of the United States requesting\r\nhim not to sign the bills, but to veto any measure for the\r\ndisfranchisement of the women of Utah.[443] Mrs. Belva A. Lockwood\r\nmade an able speech before the convention on this question. There were\r\nat that time several bills before Congress to deprive Utah women of\r\nthe elective franchise.\r\n\r\nDuring the subsequent years of this agitation every issue of the\r\n_Woman's Exponent_ contained burning articles, letters and editorials\r\nupon this uncalled-for and unwarranted interference with the affairs\r\nof the women of this Territory. The advocates of the rights of all\r\nwomen stood up boldly for those of Utah, notwithstanding the scoffs\r\nand obloquy cast upon them. It was a fierce battle of opinions and the\r\nweaker had to succumb. The strong power of Congress conquered at last,\r\nand the Edmunds-Tucker Act of 1887 wrested from all the women, Gentile\r\nand Mormon alike, the suffrage which they had exercised for seventeen\r\nyears. Naturally they were very indignant at being arbitrarily\r\ndeprived of a vested right, but were obliged to submit. They were\r\ndetermined, however, not to do so tamely but to teach their sons,\r\nbrothers and all others the value of equal suffrage, and to use every\r\neffort in their power toward securing it whenever Statehood should be\r\nconferred.\r\n\r\nMrs. Arthur Brown and Mrs. Emily S. Richards were appointed to\r\nrepresent the Territory at the National Suffrage Convention in\r\nWashington in 1888, and were there authorized to form an association\r\nuniform with those in various States and Territories. Heretofore it\r\nhad not been considered necessary to organize, as women were already\r\nin possession of the ballot.\r\n\r\nMrs. Elizabeth Lyle Saxon and Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby, who had been\r\nlecturing on suffrage in Oregon and Washington, visited Salt Lake in\r\nSeptember, 1888. They spoke in the theater, and on the following day a\r\nreception was tendered them in the Gardo House, where they had the\r\nopportunity of meeting socially between five and six hundred people,\r\nboth Gentiles and Mormons, men and women. The same evening another\r\nlarge audience in the theater greeted them, and on the day succeeding\r\nat 10 A. M. there was a meeting for women only in the Assembly Hall.\r\nThese meetings were held under the auspices of the Woman's Relief\r\nSociety, Mrs. Zina D. H. Young, president. Though they occurred at a\r\ntime when the people were suffering from indignities heaped upon them\r\nbecause of unjust legislation, yet a strong impression was made on\r\nthose (mostly Gentiles) who never previously had been converted to\r\nsuffrage.\r\n\r\nAfter careful deliberation and several preliminary meetings in the\r\noffice of the _Woman's Exponent_, a public call was made through the\r\ndaily papers, signed by the most influential women of Salt Lake City,\r\nfor a meeting in the Assembly Hall, Jan. 10, 1889, to organize a\r\nTerritorial Suffrage Association. Mrs. Richards occupied the chair and\r\nMrs. Lydia D. Alder was elected secretary _pro tem_. Prayer was\r\noffered and the old-fashioned hymn, \"Know this that every soul is\r\nfree,\" was sung by the congregation.[444] One hundred names were\r\nenrolled and Mrs. Caine and Mrs. Richards were elected delegates to\r\nthe National Convention. Mrs. Caine was already at the Capital with\r\nher husband, the Hon. John T. Caine, Utah's delegate in the House of\r\nRepresentatives. Mrs. Richards arrived in time to give a report of the\r\nnew society, which was heard with much interest.\r\n\r\nWithin a few months fourteen counties had auxiliary societies.\r\nPossibly because of the former experience of the women there was very\r\nlittle necessity of urging these to keep up their enthusiasm. Towns\r\nand villages were soon organized auxiliary to the counties, and much\r\ngood work was done in an educational way to arouse the new members to\r\nan appreciation of the ballot, and also to convince men of the\r\nbenefits to be derived by all the people when women stood side by side\r\nwith them and made common cause.\r\n\r\nOn April 11, three months after the Territorial Association was\r\norganized, a rousing meeting was held in the Assembly Hall, in Salt\r\nLake City, Mrs. Alder, vice-president, in the chair. Eloquent\r\naddresses were made by Bishop O. F. Whitney, the Hon. C. W. Penrose,\r\nthe Hon. George Q. Cannon, Dr. Martha P. Hughes (Cannon), Mrs. Zina D.\r\nH. Young, Mrs. Richards, Ida Snow Gibbs and Nellie R. Webber.\r\n\r\nA largely attended meeting took place in the County Court House, Ogden\r\nCity, in June, the local president, Elizabeth Stanford, in the chair.\r\nBesides brief addresses from members eloquent speeches were made by C.\r\nW. Penrose and the Hon. Lorin Farr, a veteran legislator. The women\r\nspeakers of Salt Lake who had been thoroughly identified with the\r\nsuffrage cause traveled through the Territory in 1889, making speeches\r\nand promoting local interests, and strong addresses were given also by\r\ndistinguished men--the Hons. John T. Caine, John E. Booth, William H.\r\nKing (delegate to Congress), bishops and legislators. The fact can not\r\nbe controverted that the sentiment of the majority of the people of\r\nUtah always has been in favor of equal suffrage.\r\n\r\nAt the annual meeting, held in the Social Hall, Salt Lake City, in\r\n1890, Mrs. Sarah M. Kimball, a woman of great executive ability, was\r\nelected president.[445]\r\n\r\nIn 1890 Mrs. Kimball and Maria Y. Dougall went as delegates to the\r\nNational Convention and reached Washington in time to be present at\r\nthe banquet given in honor of Miss Anthony's seventieth birthday. In\r\nMrs. Kimball's report she stated that there were 300 paid-up members\r\nof the Territorial Association exclusive of the sixteen county\r\norganizations.\r\n\r\nDuring 1890 the women worked unceasingly, obtaining new members and\r\nkeeping up a vigorous campaign all the year round. Meetings were held\r\nin the most remote towns, and even the farmer's wife far away in some\r\nmountain nook did her part toward securing the suffrage.\r\n\r\nOn July 23, 1890, the day Wyoming celebrated her Statehood, the\r\nSuffrage Association of Utah assembled in Liberty Park, Salt Lake\r\nCity, to rejoice in the good fortune of Wyoming women. The fine old\r\ntrees were decorated with flags and bunting and martial music\r\nresounded through the park; speeches rich with independent thought\r\nwere made by the foremost ladies, and a telegram of greeting was sent\r\nto Mrs. Amalia Post at Cheyenne.\r\n\r\nConventions were held yearly in Salt Lake City, with the best speakers\r\namong men and women, and the counties represented by delegates. Many\r\nclasses in civil government also were formed throughout the Territory.\r\n\r\nAt the National Convention in Washington, in February, 1891, there\r\nwere present from Utah ten representatives, and the number of paid-up\r\nmembers entitled the delegates to twenty votes, the largest number of\r\nany State except New York.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 15, 1892, the association celebrated Susan B. Anthony's\r\nbirthday in one of the largest halls in Salt Lake City, handsomely\r\ndecorated and the Stars and Stripes waving over the pictures of Mrs.\r\nStanton and Miss Anthony. Several members of the Legislature took part\r\nin the exercises, which were entirely of a suffrage character. A\r\ntelegram was received from Miss Anthony which said, \"Greetings, dear\r\nfriends: that your citizens' right to vote may soon be secured is the\r\nprayer of your co-worker.\" A message of love and appreciation was\r\nreturned.\r\n\r\nOn July 29, 1892, a grand rally in the interest of suffrage was held\r\nin American Fork, attended by the leaders from Salt Lake City and\r\nother parts of the Territory. Ladies wore the yellow ribbon and many\r\ngentlemen the sunflower; the visitors were met at the station with\r\ncarriages and horses decorated in yellow, and bands of music were in\r\nattendance. Mrs. Hannah Lapish, the local president, had charge, a\r\nfine banquet was spread, and the entire day was a grand feast of\r\nsuffrage sentiment. C. W. Penrose was the orator.\r\n\r\nDuring 1892 Mrs. Wells traveled in California and Idaho, and wherever\r\nshe went, in season and out of season, spoke a good word for the\r\ncause, often where women never had given the subject a thought, or had\r\nconsidered it brazen and unwomanly. The annual convention in October\r\nwas an enthusiastic one, but the real work of the women during that\r\nyear was for the Columbian Exposition, though a suffrage song book was\r\npublished and much literature circulated, not only in Utah but\r\nbroadcast throughout the West; and Mrs. Richards did some work in\r\nSouthern Idaho.\r\n\r\nIn some striking respects 1893 was a woman's year, and much was done\r\nto advance the suffrage cause indirectly. The association gave a large\r\ngarden party in Salt Lake, with addresses by Mrs. Minnie J. Snow, Mrs.\r\nJulia P. M. Farnsworth and the Hon. George Q. Cannon.\r\n\r\nAt the annual convention Mrs. Wells was elected president, Mrs.\r\nRichards vice-president, and they continued in office during the time\r\nof the struggle to obtain an equal suffrage clause in the State\r\nconstitution. Mrs. Wells made personal visits throughout the\r\nTerritory, urging the women to stand firm for the franchise and\r\nencourage the men who were likely to take part in the work toward\r\nStatehood to uphold the rights of the women who had helped to build up\r\nthe country, as well as those who since then had been born in this\r\ngoodly land, reminding them that their fathers had given women\r\nsuffrage a quarter of a century before.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1894, Mrs. Wells called an assembly of citizens for the\r\npurpose of arousing a greater interest in a Statehood which should\r\ninclude equal rights for women as well as men. The audience was a\r\nlarge one of representative people. They sang Julia Ward Howe's\r\nBattle Hymn of the Republic and also America, and brilliant addresses\r\nwere made by the Hon. John E. Booth, the Hon. Samuel W. Richards, Dr.\r\nRichard A. Hasbrouck, a famous orator formerly of Ohio, Dr. Martha\r\nHughes Cannon, Mrs. Zina D. H. Young and Mrs. Lucy A. Clark. As a\r\nresult of this gathering parlor meetings were held in various parts of\r\nthe city, arousing much serious thought upon the question, as the\r\nTerritory was now on the verge of Statehood.\r\n\r\nOn July 16 President Grover Cleveland signed the enabling act and the\r\n_Woman's Exponent_ chronicled the event with words of patriotic ardor,\r\nurging the women to stand by their guns and not allow the framers of\r\nthe constitution to take any action whereby they might be defrauded of\r\ntheir sacred rights to equality. Miss Anthony's message was quoted,\r\n\"Let it be the best basis for a State ever engrossed on parchment;\"\r\nand never did the faith of its editor waver in the belief that this\r\nwould be done.\r\n\r\nFrom this time unremitting work was carried on by the women in all\r\ndirections; every effort possible was made to secure a convention of\r\nmen who would frame a constitution without sex distinction, and to\r\nprovide that the woman suffrage article should be included in the\r\ndocument itself and not be submitted separately.\r\n\r\nAt the annual convention in October, 1894, a cordial resolution was\r\nunanimously adopted thanking the two political parties for having\r\ninserted in their platforms a plank approving suffrage for women.\r\n\r\nThe November election was most exciting. Women all over the Territory\r\nworked energetically to elect such delegates to the convention as\r\nwould place equal suffrage in the constitution.\r\n\r\nAfter the election, when the battle was in progress, women labored\r\ntactfully and industriously; they tried by every means to educate and\r\nconvert the general public, circulated suffrage literature among\r\nneighbors and friends and in the most remote corners, for they knew\r\nwell that even after the constitution was adopted by the convention it\r\nmust be voted on by all the men of the Territory.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1895, the president, Mrs. Wells, went to Atlanta to the\r\nNational Convention, accompanied by Mrs. Marilla M. Daniels and Mrs.\r\nAurelia S. Rogers. In her report she stated that the women of Utah had\r\nnot allied themselves with either party but labored assiduously with\r\nboth Republicans and Democrats. In closing she said: \"There are two\r\ngood reasons why our women should have the ballot apart from the\r\ngeneral reasons why all women should have it--first, because the\r\nfranchise was given to them by the Territorial Legislature and they\r\nexercised it seventeen years, never abusing the privilege, and it was\r\ntaken away from them by Congress without any cause assigned except\r\nthat it was a political measure; second, there are undoubtedly more\r\nwomen in Utah who own their homes and pay taxes than in any other\r\nState with the same number of inhabitants, and Congress has, by its\r\nenactments in the past, virtually made many of these women heads of\r\nfamilies.\"\r\n\r\nA convention was held February 18 in the Probate Court room of the\r\nSalt Lake City and County building. Delegates came from far and near.\r\nMrs. Wells presided, and vice-presidents were Mrs. Richards, Mrs. C.\r\nW. Bennett; secretary, Mrs. Nellie Little; assistant secretary, Mrs.\r\nAugusta W. Grant; chaplain, Mrs. Zina D. H. Young. A committee was\r\nappointed by the Chair to prepare a memorial for the convention,[446]\r\nand stirring speeches were made by delegates from the various\r\ncounties.\r\n\r\nIn the afternoon as many of the ladies as could gain admittance went\r\ninto another hall in the same building, where the Constitutional\r\nConvention was in session, and where already some members had begun to\r\noppose woman suffrage in the constitution proper and to suggest it as\r\nan amendment to be voted upon separately. The Hon. F. S. Richards, a\r\nprominent member, presented their memorial, which closed with the\r\nfollowing paragraph: \"We therefore ask you to provide in the\r\nconstitution that the rights of citizens of the State of Utah to vote\r\nand hold office shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex, but\r\nthat male and female citizens of the State shall equally enjoy all\r\ncivil, political and religious rights and privileges.\" This was signed\r\nby Emeline B. Wells, president Woman Suffrage Association; Emily S.\r\nRichards, vice-president; Zina D. H. Young, president National\r\nWoman's Relief Society; Jane S. Richards, vice-president, and all the\r\ncounty presidents.\r\n\r\nThe next morning a hearing was granted to the ladies before the\r\nSuffrage Committee. Carefully prepared papers were read by Mesdames\r\nRichards, Carlton, Cannon, Milton, Pardee and Pratt. Mrs. Wells spoke\r\nlast, without notes, stating pertinent facts and appealing for\r\njustice.\r\n\r\nThere was much debate, pro and con, in the convention after this time,\r\nand open and fair discussions of the question in Committee of the\r\nWhole. The majority report was as follows:\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That the rights of citizens of the State of Utah to\r\n     vote and hold office shall not be denied or abridged on account\r\n     of sex. Both male and female citizens of this State shall equally\r\n     enjoy all civil, political and religious rights and privileges.\r\n\r\nThe minority report submitted later was too weak and flimsy to be\r\nconsidered.\r\n\r\nThe women addressed a cordial letter of appreciation and thanks to the\r\ncommittee who had so nobly stood by their cause.[447] Having secured\r\nthis favorable report the women had not supposed it would be necessary\r\nto continue their efforts, and it would not have been except for a\r\nfaction led by Brigham H. Roberts who actively worked against the\r\nadoption of this article by the delegates.[448] Numerously signed\r\npetitions for woman suffrage from all parts of the Territory were at\r\nonce sent to the convention.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of April 8 the section on equal suffrage which had\r\npassed its third reading was brought up for consideration, as had been\r\npreviously decided. The hall was crowded to suffocation, but as the\r\ndebate was limited to fifteen minutes it was soon disposed of without\r\nmuch argument from either side. The vote of the convention was 75\r\nayes, 6 noes, 12 absent. Every member afterwards signed the\r\nconstitution.\r\n\r\nOn May 12, Miss Anthony and the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, president and\r\nvice-president-at-large of the National Association, arrived, as\r\npromised, to hold a suffrage conference. They were accompanied by Mrs.\r\nMary C. C. Bradford and Mrs. Ellis Meredith of Colorado. The\r\nconference met in the hall where the Constitutional Convention had\r\nadjourned a few days before. Mrs. Wells presided and Gov. Caleb W.\r\nWest introduced Miss Anthony, assuring his audience it was a\r\ndistinguished honor, and declaring that the new State constitution\r\nwhich included woman suffrage would be carried at the coming election\r\nby an overwhelming majority. Miss Anthony responded in a most\r\nacceptable manner. Governor West also introduced Miss Shaw who made an\r\neloquent address. Mrs. Bradford and Mrs. Meredith were formally\r\npresented and welcome was extended by Mesdames Zina D. H. Young, W.\r\nFerry, B. W. Smith, J. Milton, C. E. Allen, M. I. Home, E. B. Ferguson\r\nand the Hon. J. R. Murdock, a pioneer suffragist and member of the\r\nlate convention.\r\n\r\nThe same afternoon a reception was given in honor of the ladies at the\r\nhandsome residence of the Hon. F. S. and Mrs. Richards, attended by\r\nover three hundred guests, including State officials, officers and\r\nladies from the military post, and many people of distinction. The\r\nconference lasted two days, with large audiences, and the newspapers\r\npublished glowing accounts of the proceedings and the enthusiasm. Many\r\nsocial courtesies were extended.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony and her party held meetings in Ogden and were honored in\r\nevery possible way, the Hon. Franklin D. Richards and his wife and the\r\nHon. D. H. Peery being among the entertainers there.\r\n\r\nThe question soon arose whether women should vote on the adoption of\r\nthe constitution at the coming November election. The commission which\r\nhad been appointed by the U. S. Government to superintend affairs in\r\nUtah, decided at their June meeting to submit the matter to the\r\nAttorney-General. There was considerable agitation by the public\r\npress; some newspapers favored the women's voting and others thought\r\nits legality would be questioned and thus the admission to Statehood\r\nwould be hindered. The women generally were willing to abide by the\r\nhighest judicial authority.\r\n\r\nA test case was brought before the District Court in Ogden, August 10.\r\nThe court room was crowded with attorneys and prominent citizens to\r\nhear the decision of Judge H. W. Smith, which was that women should\r\nregister and vote. The case was then carried to the Supreme Court of\r\nthe Territory and the decision given August 31. Chief Justice Samuel\r\nA. Merritt stated that Judge G. W. Bartch and himself had reached the\r\nconclusion that the Edmunds-Tucker Law had not been repealed and would\r\nremain effective till Statehood was achieved, and that he would file a\r\nwritten opinion reversing the judgment of the lower court. Judge\r\nWilliam H. King, the other member, dissented and declared that \"the\r\ndisfranchisement of the women at this election he regarded as a wrong\r\nand an outrage.\"\r\n\r\nThe opinion of the Supreme Court could not be ignored and therefore\r\nthe women citizens acquiesced with the best grace possible.\r\nUnremitting and effective work continued to be done by the suffrage\r\nassociation, although the foremost women soon affiliated with the\r\nrespective parties and began regular duty in election matters. The\r\nleaders went through the Territory urging women everywhere to look\r\nafter the interests of the election and see that men voted right on\r\nthe constitution, which was not only of great importance to them and\r\ntheir posterity but to all women throughout the land.\r\n\r\nWomen attended conventions, were members of political committees and\r\nworked faithfully for the election of the men who had been nominated\r\nat the Territorial Convention. A few women also had been placed on the\r\ntickets--Mrs. Emma McVicker for Superintendent of Public Instruction,\r\nMrs. Lillie Pardee for the Senate, and Mrs. E. B. Wells for the House\r\nof Representatives, on the Republican ticket, and it was held that\r\nalthough women were not allowed to vote, they might be voted for by\r\nmen. But finally, so many fears were entertained lest the success of\r\nthe ticket should be imperiled that the women were induced to\r\nwithdraw. Mrs. Wells' name remained until the last, but the party\r\ncontinuing to insist, she very reluctantly yielded, informing the\r\ncommittee that she did it under protest. On Nov. 5, 1895, the\r\nRepublican party carried the election by a large majority; the\r\nconstitution was adopted by 28,618 ayes, 2,687 noes, and Full Suffrage\r\nwas conferred on women.\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n  LAURA M.

Heber M. Wells took the oath\r\nadministered by Chief Justice Charles S. Zane, and at a given\r\nsignal the booming of artillery was heard from Capitol Hill.\r\nSecretary-of-State Hammond read the Governor's first proclamation\r\nconvening the Legislature at 3 o'clock that day. Mrs. Pardee was\r\nelected clerk of the Senate and entered upon the duties of the office\r\nat the opening session, signing the credentials of the U. S.\r\nSenators--the first case of the kind on record. C. E. Allen had been\r\nelected representative to Congress, and the Legislature at once\r\nselected Frank J. Cannon and Arthur Brown as United States Senators.\r\n\r\nAt the National Suffrage Convention in Washington, the evening of\r\nJanuary 27 was devoted to welcoming Utah. Representative Allen and\r\nwife were on the platform. The Rev. Miss Shaw tendered the welcome of\r\nthe association. Senator Cannon, who had just arrived in the city,\r\nresponded declaring that woman was the power needed to reform\r\npolitics. Mrs. Allen and Mrs. S. A. Boyer spoke of the courage and\r\npersistence of the women, and Mrs. Richards gave a graphic account of\r\nthe faithful work done by the Utah Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1897, Mrs. Wells attended the National Convention in Des\r\nMoines, Iowa, and described the first year's accomplishments to an\r\nappreciative audience.\r\n\r\nOn Oct. 30, 1899, Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the National\r\norganization committee, and Miss Mary G. Hay, secretary, came to Salt\r\nLake City on the homeward way from Montana, and a meeting was held in\r\nthe office of the _Woman's Exponent_, Mrs. Wells in the chair and\r\nabout twenty-five ladies present, all ardent suffragists. After due\r\ndeliberation a committee was appointed, Mrs. Richards, chairman, Mrs.\r\nJ. Fewson Smith, secretary, to work for suffrage in other States,\r\nespecially Arizona. Subsequently this committee organized properly,\r\nadopted the name Utah Council of Women, and did all in their power to\r\nraise means and carry on the proposed work, and dues were sent to the\r\nnational treasury.\r\n\r\nIn February, 1900, Mrs. Richards, president, and Mrs. Lucy A. Clark,\r\ndelegate, went to Washington and took part in the National Convention\r\nand the celebration of Miss Anthony's eightieth birthday. On this\r\noccasion the Utah Silk Commission presented to her a handsome black\r\nsilk dress pattern, which possessed an especial value from the fact\r\nthat the raising of the silk worms, the spinning of the thread and all\r\nthe work connected with its manufacture except the weaving was done by\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nDuring this year the Council of Women worked assiduously to make a\r\ncreditable exhibit at the national suffrage bazar, Mrs. Mary T. Gilmer\r\nhaving personal charge of it in New York City.\r\n\r\nLAWS: Dower and curtesy are abolished. The law reserves for the widow\r\none-third of all the real property possessed by the husband free from\r\nhis debts, but the value of such portion of the homestead as is set\r\napart for her shall be deducted from this share. If either husband or\r\nwife die without a will leaving only one child or the lawful issue of\r\none, the survivor takes one-half the real estate; if there are more\r\nthan one or issue of one living, then one-third. If there is issue the\r\nsurvivor has one-half the personal estate. If none he or she is\r\nentitled to all the real and personal estate if not over $5,000 in\r\nvalue, exclusive of debts and expenses. Of all over that amount the\r\nsurvivor receives one-half and the parents of the deceased the other\r\nhalf in equal shares; if not living it goes to the brothers and\r\nsisters and their heirs.\r\n\r\nAlso the widow or widower is entitled to one-half the community\r\nproperty subject to community debts, and if there is no will, to the\r\nother half provided there are no children living.\r\n\r\nA homestead not exceeding $2,000 in value and $250 additional for each\r\nminor child, together with all the personal property exempt from\r\nexecution, shall be wholly exempt from the payment of the debts of\r\ndecedent, and shall be the absolute property of the surviving husband\r\nor wife and minor children. This section shall not be construed to\r\nprevent the disposition by will of the homestead and exempt personal\r\nproperty.\r\n\r\nA married woman has absolute control over her separate property and\r\nmay mortgage or convey it or dispose of it by will without the\r\nhusband's consent. The husband has the same right, but in conveying\r\nreal estate which is community property, the wife's signature is\r\nnecessary.\r\n\r\nA married woman may engage in business in her own name and \"her\r\nearnings, wages and savings become her separate estate without any\r\nexpress gift or contract of the husband, when she is permitted to\r\nreceive and retain them and to loan and invest them in her own name\r\nand for her own benefit, and they are exempt from execution for her\r\nhusband's debts.\" (1894.)\r\n\r\nA married woman may make contracts, sue and be sued in her own name.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the children, and at his death the\r\nmother. The survivor may appoint a guardian.\r\n\r\nSupport for the wife may be granted by the court the same as alimony\r\nin divorce, if the husband have property in the State. If not there is\r\nno punishment for non-support. (1896.)\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 13 years in\r\n1888, and to 18 years in 1896. The penalty is imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary not less than five years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: The Territorial Legislature conferred the Full Suffrage on\r\nwomen in 1870, and they exercised it very generally until 1887 when\r\nthey were deprived of it by Congress through what is known as the\r\nEdmunds-Tucker Act. Utah entered the Union in 1896 with Full Suffrage\r\nfor women as an article of the State constitution.\r\n\r\nThat they exercise this privilege quite as extensively as men is shown\r\nby the following table prepared from the election statistics of 1900.\r\nIt is not customary to make separate returns of the women's votes and\r\nthese were obtained through the courtesy of Governor Wells, who, at\r\nthe request of the Utah Council of Women, wrote personal letters to\r\nthe county officials to secure them. Eleven of the more remote\r\ncounties did not respond but those having the largest population did\r\nso, and, judging from previous statistics, the others would not change\r\nthe proportion of the vote.\r\n\r\n\r\n  Counties.

Women\r\ncast nearly 50 per cent. of the entire vote and yet the U. S. Census\r\nof this year showed that males comprised over 51 per cent. of the\r\npopulation.\r\n\r\nAll of the testimony which is given in the chapters on Wyoming,\r\nColorado and Idaho might be duplicated for Utah. From Mormon and\r\nGentile alike, from the press, from the highest officials, from all\r\nwho represent the best interests of the State, it is unanimously in\r\nfavor of suffrage for women. The evidence proves beyond dispute that\r\nthey use it judiciously and conscientiously, that it has tended to the\r\nbenefit of themselves and their homes, and that political conditions\r\nhave been distinctly improved.[449]\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Governor Heber M. Wells at once carried into effect\r\nthe spirit of the constitution, adopted in 1895, by appointing women\r\non all State boards of public institutions where it was wise and\r\npossible. Two out of five places on the Board of the Deaf and Dumb\r\nInstitute were given to women, Harriet F. Emerson and Dr. Martha\r\nHughes Cannon.\r\n\r\nThe first Legislature, 1896, passed \"An act for the establishment of\r\nsericulture\" (raising of silk worms). Women had worked energetically\r\nto secure this measure, and it was appropriate that five of them,\r\nthree Republican and two Democratic, should be appointed as a silk\r\ncommission, Zina D. H. Young, Isabella E. Bennett, Margaret A. Caine,\r\nAnn C. Woodbury and Mary A. Cazier. Each was required to give a\r\nthousand-dollar bond. A later Legislature appropriated $1,000 per\r\nannum to pay the secretary.\r\n\r\nTwo women were appointed on the Board of Regents of the State\r\nUniversity, Mrs. Emma J. McVicker, Republican and Gentile; Mrs.\r\nRebecca E. Little, Democrat and Mormon. Both are still serving. Two\r\nwere appointed Regents of the Agricultural College, Mrs. Sarah B.\r\nGoodwin and Mrs. Emily S. Richards.\r\n\r\nAt the close of the Legislature the Republican State Central Committee\r\nwas reorganized; Mrs. Emmeline B. Wells was made vice-chairman, Miss\r\nJulia Farnsworth, secretary. The Democratic party was quite as liberal\r\ntoward women and the feeling prevailed that at the next election women\r\nwould be placed in various State and county offices. There were many\r\nwomen delegates in the county and also in the State conventions of\r\nboth parties in 1896, and a number of women were nominated.\r\n\r\nIt was a Democratic victory and the women on that ticket were\r\nelected--Dr. Martha Hughes Cannon to the Senate, Eurithe Le Barthe and\r\nSarah A. Anderson to the House; Margaret A. Caine, auditor of Salt\r\nLake County; Ellen Jakeman, treasurer Utah County; Delilah K. Olson,\r\nrecorder Millard County; Fannie Graehl (Rep.), recorder Box Elder\r\nCounty, and possibly some others.\r\n\r\nIn the Legislature of 1897, Mrs. Le Barthe introduced a bill\r\nforbidding women to wear large hats in places of public entertainment,\r\nwhich was passed. Dr. Cannon championed the measure by which a State\r\nBoard of Health was created, and was appointed by the Governor as one\r\nof its first members. She had part in the defeat of the strong lobby\r\nthat sought to abolish the existing State Board of Public Examiners,\r\nwhich prevents incompetents from practicing medicine. She introduced a\r\nbill compelling the State to educate the deaf, mute and blind; another\r\nrequiring seats for women employes; what was known as the Medical\r\nBill, by which all the sanitary measures of the State are regulated\r\nand put in operation; and another providing for the erection of a\r\nhospital for the State School of the Deaf, Dumb and Blind, carrying\r\nwith it the necessary appropriation. All the bills introduced or\r\nchampioned by Dr. Cannon became laws. She served on the Committees on\r\nPublic Health, Apportionment, Fish and Game, Banks and Banking,\r\nEducation, Labor, etc.\r\n\r\nAt the close of their second term the Senate presented her with a\r\nhandsome silver-mounted album containing the autographs of all the\r\nSenators and employes. She had drawn what is known as the long term,\r\nand at its close she was chosen to present a handsome gavel to the\r\npresident of the Senate in behalf of the members. Thus far she has\r\nbeen the only woman Senator.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 Mrs. Alice Merrill Horne (Dem.), the third woman elected to\r\nthe House, was appointed chairman of the State University Land Site\r\nCommittee, to which was referred the bill authorizing the State to\r\ntake advantage of the congressional land grant offered for expending\r\n$301,000 in buildings and providing for the removal of the State\r\nUniversity to the new site. At a jubilee in recognition of the gift,\r\nheld by the faculty and students, at which the Governor and\r\nLegislature were guests, Mrs. Horne was the only woman to make a\r\nspeech and was introduced by President Joseph T. Kingsbury in most\r\nflattering terms for the work she had done in behalf of education. She\r\nchampioned the Free Scholarship Bill giving one hundred annual Normal\r\nSchool appointments, each for a term of four years; and one creating a\r\nState Institute of Art for the encouragement of the fine arts and for\r\nart in public school education and in manufactures, for an annual\r\nexhibition, a course of lectures and a State art collection, both of\r\nwhich passed. She was a member of committees on Art, Education, Rules\r\nand Insane Asylum; was the only member sent to visit the State Insane\r\nAsylum, going by direction of the Speaker of the House, as a committee\r\nof one, to surprise the superintendent and report actual conditions.\r\nMrs. Horne was presented with a photographed group of the members of\r\nthe House, herself the only woman in the picture.\r\n\r\nThe November election of 1900 was fraught with great interest to the\r\nwomen, as the State officials were to be elected as well as the\r\nLegislature, and they were anxious that there should be some women's\r\nnames on the tickets for both the House and Senate, and that a woman\r\nshould be nominated for State Superintendent of Public Instruction by\r\nboth parties. For this office the Republican and the Democratic women\r\npresented candidates,--Mrs. Emma J. McVicker and Miss Ada Faust,--but\r\nboth conventions gave the nomination to men. Meantime Dr. John R.\r\nPark, the superintendent, died suddenly and Gov. Wells appointed Mrs.\r\nMcVicker as his successor for the unfinished term.\r\n\r\nMrs. J. Ellen Foster, of Washington, D. C. was sent to Utah by the\r\nRepublican National Committee, and with Mrs. W. F. Boynton and others,\r\nmade a spirited and successful campaign.\r\n\r\nThere never has been any scramble for office on the part of women, and\r\nhere, as in the other States where they have the suffrage, there is\r\nbut little disposition on the part of men to divide with them the\r\n\"positions of emolument and trust.\" Only one woman was nominated for a\r\nState office in 1900, Mrs. Elizabeth Cohen for the Legislature, and\r\nshe was defeated with the rest of the Democratic ticket. All of the\r\nwomen who have served in the Legislature have been elected by the\r\nDemocrats.\r\n\r\nSeveral women were elected to important city and county offices. In\r\nmany of these offices more women than men are employed as deputies and\r\nclerks.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 Mrs. W. H. Jones was sent as delegate to the National\r\nRepublican Convention in Philadelphia, and Mrs. Elizabeth Cohen to the\r\nDemocratic in Kansas City, and both served throughout the sessions.\r\nThis is the first instance of the kind on record, although women were\r\nsent as alternates from Wyoming to the National Republican Convention\r\nat Minneapolis in 1888.\r\n\r\nWomen are exempted from sitting on juries, the same as editors,\r\nlawyers and ministers, but they are not excluded if they wish to serve\r\nor the persons on trial desire them. None has thus far been summoned.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to women\r\nexcept that of working in mines.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All of the higher institutions of learning are open to both\r\nsexes. In the public schools there are 527 men and 892 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $61.42; of the women, $41.19.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWomen in Utah always have been conspicuous in organized work. The\r\nNational Woman's Relief Society was established at Nauvoo, Ills., in\r\n1842, and transferred to Salt Lake City in 1848. It is one of the\r\noldest associations of women in the United States--the oldest perhaps\r\nof any considerable size. It has over 30,000 members and is one of the\r\nvaluable institutions of the State. The National Young Ladies' Mutual\r\nImprovement Association has 21,700 members and in 1900 raised $3,000\r\npartly for building purposes and partly to help the needy.[450] There\r\nare also a State Council of Women, Daughters of the Pioneers,\r\nDaughters of the Revolution, Council of Jewish Women, etc.\r\nThirty-three clubs belong to the National Federation but this by no\r\nmeans includes all of them.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[441] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Emmeline B.\r\nWells of Salt Lake City, editor of the _Woman's Exponent_, and\r\npresident of the Territorial Association during the campaign when Full\r\nSuffrage was secured. Valuable assistance has been rendered by Mrs.\r\nEmily S. Richards of that city, vice-president during the same period.\r\n\r\n[442] Committee: Lillie Devereux Blake of New York, Virginia L. Minor\r\nof St. Louis, Harriet R. Shattuck of Boston, May Wright Sewall of\r\nIndianapolis and Ellen H. Sheldon of Washington, D.

Fox, Priscilla Jennings, Lillie\r\nPardee and Martha Parsons.\r\n\r\n[447] Hon. J. F. Chidester, chairman; A. S. Anderson, Joseph E.\r\nRobinson, Parley Christianson, Peter Lowe, James D. Murdock, Chester\r\nCall, Andreas Engberg, A. H. Raleigh, William Howard, F. A. Hammond,\r\nS. R. Thurman. In addition to this committee those who sustained the\r\nwomen and pleaded their cause were Messrs. Richards, Whitney, Evans,\r\nCannon, Murdock, Rich, Hart, Ivins, Snow, Robinson, Allen, Miller,\r\nFarr, Preston, Maeser and Wells. There were others, but these were the\r\nforemost.\r\n\r\n[448] Mr. Roberts was elected to Congress on the Democratic ticket in\r\n1900, although strenuously opposed by the women of Utah, irrespective\r\nof politics, but largely owing to the vigorous protests of the women\r\nof the whole United States, he was not permitted to take his seat.\r\n[Eds.\r\n\r\n[449] See Appendix--Testimony from Woman Suffrage States.\r\n\r\n[450] In 1889 Mrs. Susa Young Gates established the _Young Woman's\r\nJournal_, a monthly magazine, as the organ of this association,\r\nalthough it was for eight years financially a private enterprise. The\r\npresident, Mrs. Elmina S. Taylor, was her constant help and\r\ninspiration. The first year Mrs. Lucy B. Young, mother of the editor,\r\nthen past sixty, took her buggy and traveled over Utah explaining the\r\nventure and securing subscriptions. Two thousand numbers a year were\r\npublished. Of late years the business managers have been women. In\r\n1897 Mrs. Gates made over the magazine to the association without any\r\nconsideration, but was retained as editor. There were at this time\r\npractically no debts and 7,000 subscribers, which later were increased\r\nto 10,000.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVII.\r\n\r\nVERMONT.[451]\r\n\r\n\r\nMuch credit is due to the New England Woman Suffrage Association for\r\nthe life and efficiency of the Vermont society. In 1883 this\r\norganization secured the services of Mrs. Hannah Tracy Cutler of\r\nIllinois for a series of lectures. At the close of these, and pursuant\r\nto a call signed by twenty-five citizens, a convention was held at St.\r\nJohnsbury, November 8, 9, when, with the aid of Lucy Stone and Henry\r\nB. Blackwell, editors of the _Woman's Journal_, Mrs. Julia Ward Howe\r\nof Massachusetts, and Mrs. Cutler, the State W. S. A. was formed.[452]\r\n\r\nIn over seventy towns and villages local committees have been\r\nappointed to distribute literature, circulate petitions and further\r\nthe general plans of work. For the past two years the editors have\r\nbeen supplied with suffrage papers weekly or fortnightly.\r\n\r\nLecture trips have been arranged for the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nvice-president-at-large of the National Association, Mrs. Zerelda G.\r\nWallace of Indiana, the Rev. Ada C. Bowles, the Rev. Louis A. Banks,\r\nMiss Alice Stone Blackwell, Miss Diana Hirschler, Miss Ida M. Buxton,\r\nof Massachusetts, and Mrs. M. L. T. Hidden. Eighty appointments have\r\nbeen filled by Miss Mary N. Chase, A. B. Thirty conventions have been\r\nheld at which valuable aid has been rendered by Mr. and Miss\r\nBlackwell, Miss Shaw, Mrs. Howe, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore and Mrs.\r\nCarrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the national organization\r\ncommittee.[453]\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: Harvey Howes of West Haven was the only\r\nman in a convention called to amend the State constitution in 1870,\r\nwho voted to grant full political rights to women; 233 voted in\r\nopposition.\r\n\r\nTo secure to taxpaying women the right of Municipal Suffrage, has been\r\nthe special line of legislative work for the State association.\r\nPetitions asking for this, with signatures varying in number from\r\n1,225 to 3,616, and bills to grant it, have been presented in both\r\nHouses of the Legislature at nine biennial sessions, beginning with\r\n1884. In every instance save one these have been referred to the\r\nJudiciary Committees.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 a Municipal Suffrage Bill was introduced into the House by O.\r\nE. Butterfield and supported by himself and Messrs. Adams, Henry,\r\nStickney and others, but was lost by 69 yeas, 113 nays.\r\n\r\nIn 1886 a bill to permit all women to vote who paid taxes was\r\nintroduced and strongly advocated in the House by Luke P. Poland. It\r\nwas amended without his consent to require that they should pay taxes\r\non $200 worth of property, and passed by 139 yeas, 89 nays. In the\r\nSenate it was championed by Messrs. Bates, Blake, Bunker, Clark,\r\nCushing, Foster, Pierce, Smith, Stanley and Swain, but was lost by 10\r\nyeas, 18 nays.\r\n\r\nIn 1888 a Municipal Suffrage Bill was introduced into the House by C.\r\nP. Marsh, chairman of the Judiciary Committee, that gave a hearing at\r\nwhich the State W. S. A. was represented. Later, at a public hearing\r\nin Representatives' Hall, Henry B. Blackwell, Prof. W. H. Carruth of\r\nKansas, Col. Albert Clarke, Mrs. Mary W. Foster and Miss Laura Moore\r\nurged the passage of this bill. It was reported to the House \"without\r\nexpression of opinion.\" The friendly members on the committee were\r\nMessrs. Marsh, Ballard and Mann. In the debate which followed, these\r\nthree, with Messrs. Southworth and Dole, supported the bill; and a\r\nletter was read from Amasa Scott, presenting arguments in its favor.\r\nIt was lost by 38 yeas, 192 nays.\r\n\r\nStill later in this session a petition signed by the officers of the\r\nState association asking that \"property owned by women be exempt from\r\ntaxation,\" was presented in the House; as was also a bill by Hosea\r\nMann providing that, \"The property, both real and personal, owned by\r\nwomen shall be exempt from taxation, except for school purposes.\" This\r\nwas defeated without debate.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 a Municipal Suffrage Bill was introduced into the House by Mr.\r\nMann and favorably reported by the Judiciary Committee, with reasons\r\ngiven \"why the bill ought to pass,\" signed by Messrs. Thompson,\r\nDarling, Enright, Mann, Robinson and Smith of St. Albans. It was\r\nadvocated by them, Smith of Royalton and others, but was lost by 99\r\nyeas, 113 nays.\r\n\r\nDuring this session a bill to incorporate the Vermont W. S. A., was\r\nintroduced into the Senate by S. E. Grout. It was favorably reported\r\nfrom the General Committee, but was refused passage without debate by\r\n8 yeas, 10 nays.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 Wendell Phillips Stafford introduced the Municipal Suffrage\r\nBill into the House; it was made a special order and was championed by\r\nMessrs. Stafford, Booth, Darling, Enright, Martin, Taylor, Weston and\r\nothers, and was passed by 149 yeas, 83 nays. When it reached the\r\nSenate it was reported from the Judiciary Committee with a weighty\r\namendment, and a third reading was refused by 18 yeas, 10 nays.\r\n\r\nAt this session Gov. Levi K. Fuller in his address, under the heading\r\nof Municipal Suffrage, called attention to this question and advised\r\n\"giving the matter such consideration as in your judgment it may\r\nwarrant.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1894 the bill was introduced again into the House by Hosea Mann,\r\nwho advocated and voted for this measure in four sessions of the\r\nLegislature. Four members of the Judiciary Committee were\r\nfavorable--Messrs. Ladd, Lord, Lawrence and Stone. Its champions were\r\nMessrs. Mann, Burbank, Bridgeman, Butterfield, Fuller, Peck, Paddock,\r\nSmith of Morristown, Vance and others. It was defeated by 106 yeas,\r\n108 nays.\r\n\r\nIn 1896, for the first time, a Municipal Suffrage Bill was introduced\r\ninto the Senate, by Joseph B. Holton. It was reported favorably by the\r\ncommittee; ordered to a third reading with only one opposing voice;\r\nadvocated by Messrs. Holton, Hulburd, Merrifield and Weeks, and passed\r\nwithout a negative vote. When the bill reached the House it was\r\nreported from the Judiciary Committee \"without recommendation.\" It was\r\nsupported by Speaker Lord, Messrs. Bates, Bunker, Childs, Clark,\r\nHaskins, McClary and others, but a third reading was refused by 89\r\nyeas, 135 nays.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 petitions for Municipal Suffrage signed by 2,506 citizens were\r\npresented to the Legislature and a bill was introduced into the House\r\nby E. A. Smith. This was reported by an unfriendly chairman of the\r\nJudiciary Committee at a time when its author was not present, and was\r\nlost without the courtesy of a discussion.\r\n\r\nIn 1900, petitions for Municipal Suffrage for Women Taxpayers were\r\npresented to the Senate; a bill was introduced by H. C. Royce, and at\r\na hearing granted by the Judiciary Committee Henry B. Blackwell, L. F.\r\nWilbur, the Hon. W. A. Lord and Mrs. E. M. Denny gave arguments for\r\nit. Adverse majority and favorable minority reports were presented by\r\nthe committee. By request of Messrs. Royce and Brown, the bill was\r\nmade a special order, when it was advocated by Messrs. Royce and\r\nLeland; but a third reading was refused by 13 yeas, 15 nays. Later in\r\nthis session, a petition signed by the officers of the State W. S. A.,\r\nasking that \"women, who are taxpayers, be exempt from taxation, save\r\nfor school purposes,\" was presented to the Senate. This was, by the\r\npresiding officer, referred to the Committee on the Insane.\r\n\r\nThe names of all members voting for suffrage bills have been preserved\r\nby the State association. The names of the opponents pass into\r\noblivion with no regrets.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 a bill was presented, for the second time, by the Federation\r\nof Clubs, providing for women on the boards of State institutions\r\nwhere women or children are confined, but it was killed in committee.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 the law granting to married women the right to own and control\r\ntheir separate property and the power to make contracts, was secured\r\nthrough the efforts of the Hon. Henry C. Ide, now United States\r\nCommissioner in the Philippines. Since 1888 their wages have belonged\r\nto them.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy were abolished by the Legislature of 1896. Where\r\nthere are no children the widow or the widower takes in the estate of\r\nthe deceased $2,000 and one-half of the remainder, the other half\r\ngoing to the relatives of the deceased. If there are children, the\r\nwidow takes absolutely one-third of the husband's real estate\r\n(homestead of the value of $500 included) and one-third of his\r\npersonal property after payment of debts; the widower takes one-third\r\nof the wife's real estate absolutely, but does not share in her\r\npersonal property.\r\n\r\nThe Court of Chancery may authorize a wife to convey her separate\r\nproperty without the signature of her husband. The husband can\r\nmortgage or convey all his separate property without the wife's\r\nsignature, except her homestead right of $500.\r\n\r\nThe law equalizing the division of property to the fathers and mothers\r\nof children dying without wills, was secured by Representative T. A.\r\nChase in 1894.\r\n\r\nSenator O. M. Barber, now State auditor, was the author, in the same\r\nyear, of the law allowing a married woman to be appointed executor,\r\nguardian, administrator or trustee.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian and has custody of the persons and\r\neducation of minor children. He may appoint by will a guardian even\r\nfor one unborn. (Code, 1894.)\r\n\r\nIf the husband fail to support his wife the court may make such\r\ndecision as it thinks called for, and the town may recover from a\r\nhusband who deserted his wife and children, leaving them a charge upon\r\nit for one year previous to the time of action.\r\n\r\nA married woman deserted or neglected by her husband \"may make\r\ncontracts for the labor of her minor children, shall be entitled to\r\ntheir wages, and may in her own name sue for and recover them.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1886 the \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 14\r\nyears. In 1898 it was raised to 16 years. The penalty is imprisonment\r\nin the penitentiary not more than twenty years or a fine not exceeding\r\n$2,000, or both, at the discretion of the court. No minimum penalty is\r\nnamed.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women have the same right as men to vote on all questions\r\npertaining to schools and school officers in cities, towns and graded\r\nschool districts; and the same right to hold offices relating to\r\nschool affairs. This law, which had been enacted in 1880 and applied\r\nto \"school meetings,\" was re-enacted when the \"town system\" was\r\nestablished in 1892, and gave women the right to vote on school\r\nmatters in the town meetings.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Since 1880 \"women 21 years of age\" may be elected to\r\nthe office of town clerk, and to all school offices.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 thirteen women were elected town clerks; six were serving as\r\nschool directors, eighty-four as county superintendents and\r\nseventy-five as postmasters, according to the Vermont _Register_,\r\nwhich is not always complete.\r\n\r\nWomen sit on the State Board of Library Commissioners. In 1900 they\r\nwere made eligible to serve as trustees of town libraries.\r\n\r\nThis year also a law making women eligible to the office of notary\r\npublic was secured by Representative J. E. Buxton.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: Equal advantages are accorded to both sexes in all the\r\ncolleges, except that the State University, at Burlington, does not\r\nadmit women to its Medical Department.\r\n\r\nIn 1888, Dr. E. R. Campbell, president of the society, reported as\r\nfollows: \"The Vermont Medical Society opens wide its doors to admit\r\nwomen, and bids them welcome to all its privileges and honors, on an\r\nequal basis with their brother physicians.\"\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 509 men and 3,289 women teachers. The\r\naverage monthly salary of the men is $41.23; of the women, $25.04.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nProgressive steps have been taken in the churches of most\r\ndenominations. In 1892, for the first time, women were elected as\r\ndelegates to the annual State Convention of the Congregational\r\nChurches. In 1900 there were fifteen accredited women delegates in the\r\nconvention. The Domestic Missionary Society, an ally of this church,\r\nhas employed sixteen women during the past year as \"missionaries,\" to\r\nengage in evangelistic work in the State.\r\n\r\nThe Vermont Conference of the Methodist Episcopal Church, although it\r\ndoes not admit women to its membership, has passed resolutions five\r\ntimes in the last ten years, indorsing equal rights, and has\r\npetitioned the Legislature to grant them Municipal Suffrage. For this\r\ncredit is due to the Rev. George L. Story and the Rev. L. L. Beeman.\r\n\r\nThe Free Baptist Church passed a resolution declaring unequivocally\r\nfor the Christian principle of political equality for women at its\r\nYearly Meeting in 1889. That year, for the first time in its history,\r\nit sent a woman delegate to the General Conference.\r\n\r\nA similar resolution was passed at a meeting of the Northern\r\nAssociation of Universalists, later in the same year. This church\r\nadmits women to equal privileges in its conventions and its pulpits.\r\nThis is also true of the Unitarian Church.\r\n\r\nThe annual meeting of the State Grange in 1891 adopted this\r\nresolution: \"We sympathize with and will aid any efforts for equal\r\nsuffrage regardless of sex.\"\r\n\r\nAll the political parties have been urged to indorse woman suffrage.\r\nThe Prohibitionists did so in their annual convention of 1888. At the\r\nRepublican State Convention that year the Committee on Resolutions,\r\nthrough its chairman, Col. Albert Clarke, presented the following,\r\nwhich was adopted: \"True to its impulses, history and traditions of\r\nliberty, equality and progress, the Republican party in Vermont will\r\nwelcome women to an equal participation in government, whenever they\r\ngive earnest of desire in sufficient numbers to indicate its\r\nsuccess.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[451] The History is indebted for this chapter to Miss Laura Moore of\r\nBarnet, who has been secretary of the State Woman Suffrage Association\r\nfor seventeen years.\r\n\r\n[452] The following have been presidents: Mrs. M. L. T. Hidden, C. W.\r\nWyman, Mrs. M. E. Tucker, the Hon. Hosea Mann, Willard Chase, Mrs. A.\r\nD. Chandler, L. F. Wilbur, Mrs. P. S. Beeman, the Rev. George L.\r\nStory, Miss Elizabeth Colley, A. M.\r\n\r\nAmong those who have served on the executive board are Mesdames L. E.\r\nAlfred, A. F. Baldwin, F. W. Brown, A. M. W. Chase, E. L. Corwin, C.\r\nJ. Clark, L. D. Dyer, P. R. Edes, M. W. Foster, C. D. Gallup, S. F.\r\nLeonard, Emma J. Nelson and Julia A. Pierce; Misses Clara Eastman, O.\r\nM. Lawrence, Laura Moore, Julia E. Smith and Mary E. Spencer; the Hon.\r\nChester Pierce, Col. Albert Clarke, Dudley P. Hall and G. W. Seaver.\r\n\r\n[453] Some of those who have rendered excellent service to the cause\r\nare Mesdames Clara Bailey, Lucia G. Brown, M. A. Brewster, Inez E.\r\nCampbell, H. G. Minot, G. E. Moody, Harriet S. Moore, Emily E. Reed,\r\nClinton Smith, Mary H. Semple, Anna E. Spencer, L. B. Wilson and Jane\r\nMarlette Taft; Misses Caroline Scott, Eliza S. Eaton and I. E. Moody;\r\nthe Rev. Mark Atwood, L. N. Chandler, Editor Arthur F. Stone and\r\nex-Gov. Carroll S. Page.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXVIII.\r\n\r\nVIRGINIA.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs early as 1870 and 1871 Miss Susan B. Anthony, Mrs. Matilda Joslyn\r\nGage of New York and Mrs. Paulina Wright Davis of Rhode Island\r\nlectured on woman suffrage in Richmond. There has been, however, very\r\nlittle organized effort in its behalf, although the movement has many\r\nindividual advocates. Since 1880 the State has been represented at the\r\nnational conventions by Mrs. Orra Langhorne, who has been its most\r\nactive worker for twenty years. Other names which appear at intervals\r\nare Miss Etta Grimes Farrar, Miss Brill and Miss Henderson\r\nDangerfield. A few local societies have been formed, and in 1893 a\r\nState Association was organized, with Mrs. Langhorne as president and\r\nMrs. Elizabeth B. Dodge as secretary and treasurer. Its efforts have\r\nbeen confined chiefly to discovering the friends of the movement,\r\ndistributing literature and securing favorable matter in the\r\nnewspapers. The Richmond _Star_ is especially mentioned as a champion\r\nof the enfranchisement of women. In 1895 Miss Anthony, president of\r\nthe National Association, on her way home from its convention in\r\nAtlanta, addressed a large audience at the opera house in Culpeper.\r\nLater this year Miss Elizabeth Upham Yates of Maine spoke in the same\r\nplace. Mrs. Ruth D. Havens of Washington, D. C., lectured on The Girls\r\nof the Future before the State Teachers' Normal Institute.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: Petitions have been sent to the\r\nLegislature from time to time, by the State association and by\r\nindividuals for woman suffrage with educational qualifications, the\r\nopening of State colleges to women, the appointment of women\r\nphysicians in the prisons and insane asylums, women on school boards,\r\nproper accommodations in jails for women prisoners and the separation\r\nof juvenile offenders from the old and hardened. None of these ever\r\nhas been acted upon.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 a bill to permit women to serve as notaries public was vetoed\r\nby the Governor as unconstitutional.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy both obtain. The wife inherits a life interest in\r\none-third of the real estate. If there are children she has one-third\r\nof the personal property absolutely; if none, one-half. The husband\r\ninherits all of the wife's personal property whether there are\r\nchildren or not, and the entire real estate for life if there has been\r\nissue born alive. If this has not been the case he has no interest in\r\nthe wife's separate real estate. The homestead, to the value of\r\n$2,000, is exempted for the wife.\r\n\r\nBy Act of 1900, a married woman may dispose as though unmarried of all\r\nproperty heretofore or hereafter acquired. She can sell her personal\r\nproperty without her husband's uniting. He has the same right. She can\r\nsell her land without his uniting, but unless he does so, if curtesy\r\nexist, he will be entitled to a life estate. Unless the wife unites\r\nwith the husband in the sale of his real estate, she will be entitled\r\nto dower.\r\n\r\nBy the above Act a married woman may contract and be contracted with,\r\nsue and be sued, in the same manner and with the same consequences as\r\nif she were unmarried, whether the right or liability asserted by or\r\nagainst her accrued before or after the passage of the act. The\r\nhusband is not responsible for any contract, liability or tort of the\r\nwife, whether the liability was incurred or the tort was committed\r\nbefore or after marriage.\r\n\r\nThere has been no decision as to the wages of a married woman since\r\nthe above Act; but it is believed they would be held to belong to her\r\nabsolutely, even if not engaged in business as a sole trader.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the minor children, and may\r\nappoint a guardian for such time as he pleases.\r\n\r\nThe husband is liable for necessaries for the support of the family,\r\nand can be sued therefor by any one who supplies them.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 12 to 14 years in\r\n1896. The penalty is death or imprisonment in the penitentiary not\r\nless than five nor more than twenty years.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women possess no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: No offices are filled by women except that there is\r\none physician at the Western Insane Asylum and, through the efforts\r\nof the Woman's Christian Temperance Union, a matron in the woman's\r\nward of the State prison.\r\n\r\nWomen are employed as clerks in various county offices. They can not\r\nserve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: Under the ruling of the courts, a woman can not practice\r\nlaw. No other profession or occupation is legally forbidden to women.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: For the higher education the women of Virginia must go\r\noutside of their State.[454] The State Superintendent of Free Schools\r\nand the Secretary of the State Board of Education both express great\r\nregret at this fact, and the hope that all institutions of learning\r\nwill soon be opened to them. Secretary Frank P. Brent says:\r\n\r\n     We have as yet no women acting as school superintendents or\r\n     members of school boards, but I feel sure the Constitutional\r\n     Convention will make women eligible to one or both of these\r\n     positions.\r\n\r\n     Last year I had the honor to decide that in matters pertaining to\r\n     the educational affairs of this State, the wife may be regarded\r\n     as the head of the family, although the husband is living; and\r\n     this decision has just been reaffirmed by the United States Court\r\n     of Appeals.[455]\r\n\r\nWomen are admitted to several of the smaller colleges. The\r\nRandolph-Macon College in Ashland, and the Woman's College at\r\nLynchburgh, both under the same presidency, rank well among\r\ninstitutions for women only. Miss Celestia C. Parrish is\r\nvice-president. Hampton Institute, for negroes and Indians, is\r\nco-educational.\r\n\r\nThe public schools make no distinction of sex. There are 2,909 men and\r\n5,927 women teachers. The average monthly salary of the men is $32.09;\r\nof the women, $26.39.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[454] The State Universities are closed to women only in Virginia,\r\nGeorgia and Louisiana, and the undergraduate departments in North\r\nCarolina.\r\n\r\n[455] The decision of the court was \"When an intelligent, active,\r\nindustrious, frugal woman finds she has married a man who, instead of\r\ncoming up to the standard of a husband, is a mere dependent ... and\r\nleaves to her the support of the family, it would be contradictory of\r\nfact and an absurd construction of the law to say that he, and not\r\nshe, is the head of the family.\"\r\n\r\nThis is believed to be the first legal decision of the kind and has\r\ncreated wide discussion.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXIX.\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON.[456]\r\n\r\n\r\nThe history of woman suffrage in Washington begins with the passage of\r\na bill by the Legislature, giving women the full rights of the ballot\r\non the same terms as men, which was approved Nov. 23, 1883, by the\r\nTerritorial Governor, William A. Newell. This was due principally to\r\nthe efforts of a few individuals, both men and women, as there was no\r\norganization.[457]\r\n\r\nThe municipal elections of the following spring brought the first\r\nopportunity to exercise the newly-acquired right. The women evinced\r\ntheir appreciation of it by casting 8,368 ballots out of the whole\r\nnumber of 34,000, and the leading papers testified to the widespread\r\nacknowledgment of the strength and moral uplift of their vote.\r\n\r\nThe general election of November, 1884, naturally showed a larger vote\r\nby both men and women, the latter casting 12,000 out of the 48,000\r\nballots. It was estimated at this time that there were less than\r\none-third as many women as men in the Territory. When the scattered\r\npopulation, the long distances and the difficulties of travel are\r\ntaken into consideration it must be admitted that women took the\r\nlargest possible advantage of the recently granted privileges.\r\n\r\nFor the next two years they continued to use the franchise with\r\nunabated zeal, and newspapers and public speakers were unanimous in\r\ntheir approval. In a number of instances the official returns, during\r\nthe three-and-a-half years they possessed the suffrage, exhibited _a\r\nlarger percentage of women voting than of men_. Chief Justice Roger S.\r\nGreene of the Supreme Court estimated that at the last election before\r\nthey were disfranchised four-fifths of all the women in the Territory\r\nwent to the polls.\r\n\r\nMany women have remarked upon the increased respect and courtesy of\r\nthe men during this period. Mrs. Elizabeth Matthews, who removed from\r\nNew Orleans to Port Townsend in 1885, states that, although accustomed\r\nfrom babyhood to the deferential gallantry of the men of the South,\r\nshe never had dreamed that any women in the world were receiving such\r\nrespectful consideration as she found in Washington Territory at that\r\ntime. The political parties realized the necessity of putting their\r\nbest men to the front, and it was fully conceded that ethics had\r\nbecome a factor in politics.\r\n\r\nPrior to the Legislature of 1886 some discussion arose as to the\r\nconstitutionality of the Equal Suffrage Law, and, in order to remove\r\nall doubt, a strengthening Act was passed, which was approved by Gov.\r\nWatson C. Squire, November 29.\r\n\r\nOn Feb. 3, 1887, the case of _Harlan vs. Washington_ came before the\r\nTerritorial Supreme Court. Harlan had been convicted of carrying on a\r\nswindling game by a jury composed of both men and women, and he\r\ncontested the verdict on the ground that women were not legal voters.\r\nThe Supreme Court, whose _personnel_ had been entirely changed through\r\na new Presidential administration, decided that the law conferring the\r\nelective franchise upon them was void because it had not been fully\r\ndescribed in its title. This decision also rendered void nineteen\r\nother laws which had been enacted under the same conditions.\r\n\r\nThe members of the next Legislature had been elected so long before\r\nthe rendering of this decision that their seats could not be\r\ncontested; and as their election had been by both men and women they\r\nwere determined to re-establish the law which the Supreme Court had\r\nruthlessly overthrown. Therefore the Equal Suffrage Law was\r\nre-enacted, perfectly titled and worded, and was approved by Gov.\r\nEugene Semple, Jan. 18, 1888.\r\n\r\nThe members of a convention to prepare a State constitution were soon\r\nto be chosen, and the opponents of woman suffrage were most anxious to\r\nhave the question considered by the Supreme Court before the election\r\nof the delegates. They arranged that the judges of the spring\r\nmunicipal election in a certain precinct should refuse to accept the\r\nvote of a Mrs. Nevada Bloomer, the wife of a saloon-keeper and herself\r\nan avowed opponent of woman suffrage. This was done on April 3, and\r\nshe brought suit against them. The case was rushed through, and on\r\nAugust 14 the Supreme Court decided that the Act of January 18 was\r\ninvalid, as a Territorial Legislature had no right to enfranchise\r\nwomen, and that in consequence the Equal Suffrage Law was void. The\r\nJudges responsible for this decision were Associate Justices George\r\nTurner and William G. Langford.\r\n\r\nThe very Act of Congress which organized the Territory of Washington\r\nstated explicitly that, at elections subsequent to the first, _all\r\npersons should be allowed to vote upon whom the Territorial\r\nLegislature might confer the elective franchise_.\r\n\r\nBy the organic act under which all the Territories were formed women\r\nhad been voting in Wyoming since 1869 and in Utah since 1870. The\r\narbitrary disfranchisement of the women of the latter by Congress in\r\n1887 demonstrated that this body did have supreme control over\r\nsuffrage in the Territories, and therefore unimpeachable power to\r\nauthorize their Legislatures to confer it on women, as had been done\r\nby that of Washington. There never was a more unconstitutional\r\ndecision than that of this Territorial Supreme Court. Congress should\r\nhave refused to admit the Territory until women had voted for\r\ndelegates to the constitutional convention and on the constitution\r\nitself.[458]\r\n\r\nWithout doubt the Supreme Court of the United States would have\r\nreversed the decision of the Territorial Court, but Mrs. Bloomer\r\nrefused to allow the case to be appealed, and no one else had\r\nauthority to do so.\r\n\r\nAs the women were thus illegally restrained from voting for delegates,\r\nthe opponents of their enfranchisement were enabled to elect a\r\nconvention with a majority sufficient to prevent a woman suffrage\r\nclause in the constitution for Statehood.\r\n\r\nHenry B. Blackwell, corresponding secretary of the American W. S. A.,\r\ncame from Massachusetts to assist in securing such a clause. After a\r\nlong discussion as to whether he should be permitted to address the\r\nconvention, both sides agreed that the delegates should be invited to\r\nhear him in Tacoma Hall. His address was highly praised even by\r\nnewspapers and persons opposed to equal suffrage. Four days later,\r\nwith Judge Orange J. Jacobs and Mrs. Elizabeth Lyle Saxon, he was\r\ngranted a hearing before the Suffrage Committee of the convention.\r\n\r\nThe question of incorporating woman suffrage in the new State\r\nconstitution was debated at intervals from Aug. 9 to 15, 1889. The\r\nfight for the measure was led by Edward Eldridge and W. S. Bush. In a\r\nlong and able argument Mr. Eldridge reviewed the recent decision of\r\nthe Supreme Court and made an eloquent plea for justice to women.\r\nSubstitutes granting to women Municipal Suffrage, School Suffrage, the\r\nright to hold office, the privilege of voting on the constitution, all\r\nwere defeated. Finally a compromise was forced by which it was agreed\r\nto submit a separate amendment giving them Full Suffrage, to be voted\r\non at the same time as the rest of the constitution, women themselves\r\nnot being allowed to vote upon it.[459]\r\n\r\nOnly two-and-a-half months remained before election, the women were\r\npractically unorganized, there were few speakers, no money, and the\r\ntowns were widely scattered. Miss Matilda Hindman of Pennsylvania and\r\nMrs. Clara Bewick Colby of Washington, D. C., editor of the _Woman's\r\nTribune_, came on and canvassed the State. Both were effective\r\nspeakers and they received as much local assistance as possible, but\r\nall the money and influence which could be commanded by the\r\ndisreputable element that had suffered from the woman's vote were\r\nbrought to bear against the amendment, and its defeat was inevitable.\r\n\r\nThe constitution was adopted Nov. 5, 1889, the woman suffrage\r\namendment receiving 16,521 ayes, 35,913 noes; an adverse majority of\r\n19,392.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the first State Legislature conferred School Suffrage on women\r\nto the extent of voting for trustees and directors.\r\n\r\nThe political campaign of 1896 was one in which reform of all kinds\r\nwas unusually in evidence. Three women sat as delegates in the State\r\nFusion Convention at Ellensburg. Mrs. Laura E. Peters, president of\r\nthe suffrage club at Port Angeles, was a Populist delegate and was\r\nchosen a member of the Platform Committee. Through her efforts a\r\nsuffrage plank was inserted in the platform of that branch of the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nThe president of the State Suffrage Association, Mrs. Homer M. Hill,\r\nsaid in her official report: \"The People's Party was composed of\r\nSilver Republicans, Populists and Democrats. At the State convention\r\nthese met in separate sessions. The Democrats voted down a resolution\r\ndemanding that the Committee on Platform bring in a report favoring\r\nthe amendment. The Silver Republicans passed one 'commending the\r\naction of the Free Silver party in presenting to the people the\r\nproposed amendment to the constitution.' The Populists inserted in\r\ntheir platform a plank declaring that 'direct legislation without\r\nequal suffrage would be government by but one-half of the people,' and\r\nunequivocally favored the amendment.\r\n\r\n\"Although each of these three parties had its own platform, the\r\ncombination formed the People's Party and made its fight upon one\r\ncomposed of eleven planks, or articles of faith, to which all three\r\nagreed, _but equal suffrage was not one of them_. Therefore the\r\nso-called union platform, minus suffrage, was the one generally\r\npublished and used as the basis of the campaign speeches. Because of\r\nthis no speaker of the People's Party was obliged to mention the\r\namendment, and it was avoided as an issue in the campaign; the State\r\nCentral Committee permitted each speaker to say what he pleased\r\npersonally, but he was not allowed to commit the party or to urge men\r\nto vote for it. Nearly every one, however, advocated equal suffrage.\r\n\r\n\"The Republicans, in convention at Tacoma, adopted the following:\r\n'Firmly believing in the principle of equal rights to all and special\r\nprivileges to none, we recommend to the voters of the State a careful\r\nconsideration of the proposed constitutional amendment granting equal\r\nsuffrage;' and this always was published as part of the platform. A\r\nfew of the leading Republican orators advocated the amendment and none\r\nspoke against it. Its defeat is commonly attributed to the fact that\r\n20,000 of the People's party did not vote upon it, and that _the\r\nRepublicans passed the word a short time before election to vote\r\nagainst it_.\r\n\r\n\"Mrs. W. Winslow Crannell, who was sent out by the Albany (N. Y.)\r\nAnti-Suffrage Association, did not hold a meeting of women or a public\r\nmeeting in the State. She conferred with men whom the anti-suffrage\r\nrepresentative, Alfred Downing of Seattle, already knew, and her\r\ncoming tended to arouse the loyal support of the suffragists.\r\n\r\n\"The Prohibition party gave official indorsement. The Social\r\nDemocratic party and the Socialist Labor party both inserted suffrage\r\nplanks in their platforms. The latter claims 9,000 votes in the\r\nState.\"\r\n\r\nThe Fusion party was everywhere successful and the Legislature of 1897\r\nwas composed of reform elements. Mrs. Peters had charge of the Equal\r\nSuffrage Bill, which was introduced on the first day of the session by\r\nthe Hon. J. P. de Mattos, and proposed to amend the constitution by\r\nstriking out the word \"male\" from the suffrage clause. This passed the\r\nHouse on February 4 by 54 ayes, 15 noes. The bill was amended in the\r\nSenate and was strongly supported by Joseph Hill and W. V. Rinehart.\r\nThe amended bill passed the Senate on February 25 by 23 ayes, 11 noes,\r\nand was returned to the House.\r\n\r\nHere it reached a vote March 11, the last day before the close of the\r\nsession, only through Mrs. Peters' slipping up to Speaker Charles E.\r\nCline's desk and whispering to him to recognize L. E. Rader, who\r\nwished to present it. As the Speaker was a staunch suffragist he did\r\nso. The bill passed by 54 ayes, 15 noes, and was sent back for the\r\nsignature of the President of the Senate and then returned to the\r\nHouse for the Speaker to sign. Mrs. Peters thus relates what happened\r\nafter he had done so:\r\n\r\n     By the merest accident, Senator Thomas Miller, a friend, obeyed\r\n     an impression to examine the bill to see if it were all right,\r\n     when lo and behold! he discovered that the true bill had been\r\n     stolen during the short recess and an absolutely worthless bill\r\n     engrossed and signed. Senator Miller at once made the fraud\r\n     public and Speaker Cline tore his signature from the bill. On\r\n     Thursday morning, the last day, a certified copy of the true bill\r\n     was sent to the House, where it was ratified and returned to the\r\n     Senate. I then requested the President of the Senate to make me a\r\n     special messenger to take the bill to the Governor for his\r\n     signature. As I happened to hold the peculiar position of having\r\n     voted (at the State convention) for both those gentlemen, and as\r\n     I had taken pains to remind them of that fact, and as both the\r\n     Governor and Lieutenant-Governor were suffragists, I found no\r\n     difficulty in having my request granted. I said that the bill had\r\n     been delayed, deformed, pigeon-holed and stolen, and I would not\r\n     feel safe until it was made law by the Governor's signature.\r\n\r\n     I was duly sworn in as special messenger, and very proudly\r\n     carried the bill to the office, where Gov. John R. Rogers\r\n     affixed his signature to it and declared it law.\r\n\r\nThe history of the campaign which followed, as condensed by the\r\npresident, Mrs. Hill, shows that active work did not begin until the\r\nconvention held at Seattle in January, 1898. The executive committee\r\nwas called together after its adjournment and the situation thoroughly\r\ncanvassed. A resolution which welcomed work for the amendment by other\r\nsocieties under their own auspices was unanimously passed, as it was\r\nrealized that there was not time in which to bring all suffragists\r\ninto line under one management. Money was scarce and hard to obtain,\r\nand public attention was divided between the Spanish-American War and\r\nthe gold excitement in Alaska. The association at once turned its\r\nattention to the obtaining of funds, the securing of the favorable\r\nattitude of the press and the formal indorsement of the amendment by\r\nother organizations.\r\n\r\nClubs were formed in wards and precincts to hold meetings, assist the\r\nState association financially, distribute literature and circulate a\r\npetition for signatures of women only, asking that the voters cast\r\ntheir ballots for the proposed amendment. It was impossible to\r\nprosecute the petition work thoroughly throughout the State, but the\r\nlargest cities--Seattle, Tacoma, Spokane and Olympia--with many\r\ncountry precincts, both east and west of the mountains, were very\r\nsatisfactorily canvassed. It was found that over 88 per cent. of all\r\nthe women asked to sign the petition did so. The rest were divided\r\nbetween the indifferent and those positively opposed. No one received\r\na salary for services. Less than $500 was collected, and $5.47\r\nremained in the treasury, after every bill was paid, the day before\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nThe State association issued 5,000 pieces of literature of its own, a\r\nbooklet of thirty pages containing testimonials from leading citizens\r\nof the four Free States--Wyoming, Colorado, Utah and Idaho. Early in\r\nthe campaign Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the national\r\norganization committee, sent 62,200 pieces. Henry B. Blackwell, editor\r\nof the _Woman's Journal_, shortly before the election forwarded from\r\nBoston 500 pieces to each of the thirty-four counties in Washington.\r\nThis literature no doubt helped to swell the vote for the amendment.\r\n\r\nForty country newspapers were regularly sent free to State\r\nheadquarters; the city papers at half-rates. The press was courteous\r\nin every instance, and either advocated equal suffrage, kept silence\r\nor opened its columns to both sides. The Seattle _Daily Times_\r\nstrongly favored it.\r\n\r\nThe Christian Church Convention, which met in Tacoma early in the\r\ncampaign, gave hearty indorsement to the amendment. The M. E. Church\r\nConference followed at the same place with a vote of 27 ayes, 26 noes;\r\nthe Congregational Convention at Snohomish with one dissenting vote.\r\nPresbyterian and other ministers throughout the State quietly gave\r\ntheir support. The ministerial associations of Seattle each received a\r\ncommittee from the E. S. A. One of the members of the Ministers'\r\nAssociation of Spokane read a paper on Equal Suffrage, which was\r\ninterestingly discussed, showing eight in favor, three opposed and one\r\ndoubtful. The Christian Endeavorers at their convention in Walla Walla\r\npassed a resolution calling attention to the approaching election, and\r\nasking for the intelligent consideration of the amendment; eight of\r\nthe trustees were in favor of recommending active work in local\r\nsocieties, but because the sentiment was not more nearly unanimous no\r\naction was taken. The Independent Order of Good Templars and the\r\nProhibition party indorsed the amendment. The Woman's Christian\r\nTemperance Union lent a helping hand judiciously. All demands and\r\narguments were non-sectarian and non-political, being based upon the\r\nclaims of justice as the only tenable ground on which to stand.\r\n\r\nMany of the most self-sacrificing workers came from the liberal and\r\nfree-thought societies, which are generally favorable to equal rights.\r\nThe Western Central Labor Union of Seattle extended courtesies to the\r\nE. S. A. and kept suffrage literature in its reading-room. The\r\n_Freemen's Labor Journal_ of Spokane, State organ of the trades\r\nunions, supported the amendment. Single Taxers, as a rule, voted for\r\nit. The State Grange in convention formally indorsed it and promised\r\nsupport.[460]\r\n\r\nOn Nov. 5, 1898, the amendment was voted upon, receiving 20,658 yeas,\r\n30,540 nays; majority opposed, 9,882. As in 1889, the adverse\r\nmajority was 19,392, a clear gain was shown of 9,510 in nine years.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 a bill was prepared for the State association by Judge J. W.\r\nLangley, amending the constitution so that whenever an amendment\r\ngiving the right of suffrage to women should be submitted to the\r\npeople, the women themselves should be permitted to vote upon it. John\r\nW. Pratt introduced the bill in the House, but it was referred to the\r\nCommittee on Constitutional Revision and not reported. Near the close\r\nof the session Mr. Pratt brought it up on the floor of the House. A\r\nmotion to postpone it indefinitely was immediately made and,\r\npractically without discussion, was carried by almost a unanimous\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nORGANIZATION: For twelve years before the women of Washington were\r\nenfranchised, Mrs. Abigail Scott Duniway of Oregon was in the habit of\r\ncanvassing the Territory in behalf of woman suffrage, traveling by\r\nrail, stage, steamer and on foot, and where she found halls and\r\nchurches closed against her, speaking in hotel offices and even\r\nbar-rooms, and always circulating her paper the _New Northwest_. The\r\nLegislature recognized her services by a resolution in 1886, when\r\naccepting her picture, The Coronation of Womanhood. There was not\r\nduring all this time any regularly organized suffrage association.\r\nWhen in the summer of 1888 the women of the Territory saw the\r\nfranchise taken away from them by decision of the Supreme Court, a\r\nnumber of local societies were formed and soon banded themselves into\r\nan association of which the Hon. Edward Eldridge was president until\r\nhis death in 1892. Afterward A. H. Stewart was made president, Mrs.\r\nLaura E. Peters, vice-president, and Mrs. Bessie Isaacs Savage,\r\nsecretary. Mrs. Zerelda N. McCoy was president of the Olympia Club,\r\nand Mrs. P. C. Hale, treasurer.\r\n\r\nOn Jan. 21, 22, 1895, the first delegate convention was held in\r\nOlympia, and a State Equal Suffrage Association formally organized.\r\nMrs. Savage was elected president; Mrs. Clara E. Sylvester,\r\nvice-president; Mrs. Lou Jackson Longmire, secretary; Mrs. Ella Stork,\r\ntreasurer. In April a special meeting was held in Seattle and the\r\nState was divided into six districts for organization and other work,\r\nas it was evident there would soon be another amendment campaign.\r\n\r\nThe second convention was held in Seattle, Jan. 29, 30, 1896, with the\r\nHon. Orange J. Jacobs as the principal speaker.\r\n\r\nThroughout 1897 the efforts of the suffragists were directed toward\r\nsecuring a resolution from the Legislature for the submission of an\r\namendment, and no convention was held.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1898, the State association again met in Seattle. Mrs.\r\nHomer M. Hill was elected president; Mrs. Peters, vice-president; Miss\r\nMartha E. Pike, secretary; Mrs. Savage, treasurer.\r\n\r\nThe management of the exposition held in Seattle for three weeks in\r\nOctober, kindly accorded space to the Red Cross, Equal Suffrage\r\nAssociation, W. C. T. U., Kindergarten and City Federation of Women's\r\nClubs. Mrs. Carrie Chapman Catt, with Miss Mary G. Hay, paid\r\nWashington a visit during this month. She spoke in the first M. E.\r\nChurch at Seattle to a large audience, and the Woman's Century Club\r\ntendered her a reception. At Tacoma the Woman's Study Club arranged a\r\nlecture for her in the Tacoma Hotel parlors, which was well attended\r\nby representative people. Mrs. Emma C. McCully made the preparations\r\nfor her at Ellensburg, and Mrs. Lida M. Ashenfelter bore the expense\r\nof the meeting at Spokane.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1899, the State Teachers' Association passed a resolution\r\nstrongly indorsing equal suffrage. The Mental Science Convention took\r\nsimilar action.\r\n\r\nSince the defeat of the amendment in 1898 no State conventions have\r\nbeen held. During 1900 the corresponding secretary, Miss Pike, visited\r\nmany towns and conferred with representative women in reference to\r\nagain taking up the work; while the president, Mrs. Hill, endeavored\r\nto secure the interest and indorsement of the various political\r\nparties.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In 1886 the Legislature amended the\r\nHomestead Law and gave to widows possession of the homestead, wearing\r\napparel and household furniture of their deceased husbands, and the\r\nright to comply with the legal provisions for securing homesteads in\r\ncase the husbands had not done so; it further declared that the\r\nhomestead should be inviolate from executions for the payment of\r\ndebts, either individual or community; it amended the community\r\nproperty law, giving husband and wife equal rights in the\r\ntestamentary disposition of it. It also enabled married women to act\r\nas administrators.\r\n\r\nIn 1890 the Legislature conferred School Suffrage upon women. The act\r\nwas approved by Gov. E. P. Terry on March 27. The same Legislature\r\npassed a bill requiring employers to provide seats for their female\r\nemployes, and enacted that all avenues of employment should be open to\r\nwomen. It amended the community property law so that husband or wife\r\ncould prevent the sale of his or her interest.\r\n\r\nIn 1891 a bill was passed which made a woman punishable for the crime\r\nof arson, even though the property set fire to might belong to her\r\nhusband.\r\n\r\nThe Legislature of 1893 appropriated $5,000 for the Woman's Department\r\nof the State at the World's Fair in Chicago. A bill passed this year\r\nprovided matrons for jails in cities of 10,000 or more inhabitants.\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 12 to 16 years.\r\nUnfortunately the title of this bill was omitted and in compiling the\r\ncode it was excluded, but the Supreme Court afterward legalized the\r\naction of the Legislature.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the age was raised to 18 years. This was accomplished through\r\nthe efforts of the W. C. T. U., under the management of Misses Mary L.\r\nand Emma E. Page. The penalty is imprisonment in the penitentiary for\r\nlife or \"for any term of years.\" No minimum penalty is given. Deceit\r\nor fraud may be considered force.\r\n\r\nMarried women were granted the right to act as executors of wills in\r\n1899.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy are abolished. The testamentary rights of husband\r\nand wife are the same in regard to their separate property. If either\r\ndie without a will, leaving only one child, or the lawful issue of\r\none, the widow or widower takes half the real estate. If there is more\r\nthan one child living, or one child and lawful issue of one or more\r\nchildren deceased, the widow or widower takes one-third of the real\r\nestate. If there is no descendant living the survivor receives\r\none-half the real estate, unless there is neither father, mother,\r\nbrother nor sister of the decedent living, when he or she takes all of\r\nit. The surviving husband or wife has one-half the personal property\r\nif there is issue living, otherwise all of it, after the debts are\r\npaid.\r\n\r\nThe old Spanish law in regard to community property obtains. While\r\neach retains control of his or her separate estate, the control of the\r\ncommunity property is vested absolutely in the husband. This includes\r\nall acquired after marriage by the joint or separate efforts of\r\neither; lands acquired under the homestead laws; lands purchased with\r\nmoney derived from profits or loans of the wife's separate estate;\r\nlands purchased by her with money saved from household expenses; and\r\nthe court has held that even her earnings outside the home are\r\ncommunity property unless she is living apart from her husband. The\r\nhusband can not convey this without the wife's signature, and he can\r\nnot dispose of more than one-half of it by will. Upon the death of\r\neither husband or wife one-half of the community property descends to\r\nthe survivor, and the other half is subject to testamentary\r\ndisposition. If there is no will the survivor takes half and the heirs\r\nof the deceased half; if there are none he or she takes the whole. The\r\nsurvivor has the preference in the right of administration.\r\n\r\nA married woman may make contracts and sue and be sued in her own\r\nname. Husband and wife can not enter into business partnerships with\r\neach other.\r\n\r\nBy an act of 1879 father and mother were given equal guardianship of\r\nthe children, and in case of the death of either the guardianship\r\npassed to the survivor. But in 1896 the Legislature enacted that the\r\nfather might appoint by will a guardian of both persons and estates of\r\nminor children to the exclusion of the mother.\r\n\r\nThe same Legislature passed a law making the expenses of the family\r\nand education of the children chargeable upon the property of both\r\nhusband and wife, or either of them, and provided that in relation\r\nthereto they might be sued jointly or separately.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Since 1890 women may vote for school trustees, bonds and\r\nappropriations on the same terms as men, but can not vote for State or\r\ncounty superintendents.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: In the fall of 1894 Miss Ella Guptil was elected\r\nsuperintendent of schools for Clallam County. Her right to hold the\r\noffice was contested by her opponent, C. E. Russell. Miss Guptil asked\r\nthe following Legislature to make her position definite, and in\r\nFebruary, 1895, a bill was passed and approved by Gov. John H. McGraw\r\nwhich removed all doubt, and she assumed the office.\r\n\r\nAt the present time (1900) there are seven women county\r\nsuperintendents. Women may sit on the school boards of all cities and\r\ntowns. They are not eligible to any other elective office.\r\n\r\nIn 1897-98 Mrs. Carrie Shaw Rice served as a member of the State Board\r\nof Education. Women do not sit on other boards.\r\n\r\nThe law requires women matrons in the jails of all cities of 10,000\r\ninhabitants and upwards, but not at police stations.\r\n\r\nWomen are employed in subordinate capacities in various State and\r\nmunicipal offices. They are also librarians in many places.\r\n\r\nThey can not serve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: It was enacted by the Legislature of 1890 that:\r\n\"Hereafter in this State every avenue of employment shall be open to\r\nwomen; and any business, vocation, profession and calling followed and\r\npursued by men may be followed and pursued by women, and no person\r\nshall be disqualified from engaging in or pursuing any business,\r\nvocation, profession, calling or employment on account of sex:\r\nProvided, That this section shall not be so construed as to permit\r\nwomen to hold public office.\"\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All of the educational institutions are open to both sexes\r\nalike.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 1,033 men and 2,288 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $42.13; of the women,\r\n$34.53.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[456] The History is indebted for the material for this chapter to\r\nMiss Martha E. Pike of Seattle, corresponding secretary of the State\r\nEqual Suffrage Association.\r\n\r\n[457] See History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. III, p. 776.\r\n\r\n[458] For further information see Appendix for Washington.\r\n\r\n[459] For addresses and other proceedings see the _Woman's Tribune_,\r\nOct. 5, 1889, and the following numbers.\r\n\r\n[460] That practically all of the best elements in the State favored\r\nthis amendment, and yet it was defeated, shows how thoroughly the\r\ndisreputable classes controlled politics.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXX.\r\n\r\nWEST VIRGINIA.[461]\r\n\r\n\r\nIn 1867 Samuel Young introduced into the Senate of West Virginia a\r\nbill to confer the suffrage on educated, taxpaying women, but it found\r\nno advocates except himself. In 1869 he presented a resolution asking\r\nCongress for a Sixteenth Amendment to enfranchise women, which\r\nreceived the votes of eight of the twenty-two senators.\r\n\r\nNo further step ever was taken in this direction until the spring of\r\n1895, when Mrs. Annie L. Diggs of Kansas was sent into the State by\r\nthe National Woman Suffrage Association but reported that the question\r\nwas too new to make any organization possible. In the fall Miss Mary\r\nG. Hay, national organizer, arranged a two weeks' series of meetings\r\nwith the Rev. Henrietta G. Moore of Ohio as speaker, and several clubs\r\nwere formed in the northern part of the State. A convention was called\r\nto meet in Grafton, November 25, 26, when an association was formed\r\nand the following board of officers was elected: President, Mrs.\r\nJessie C. Manley; vice-president, Harvey W. Harmer; corresponding\r\nsecretary, Mrs. Annie Caldwell Boyd; recording secretary, Mrs. L. M.\r\nFay; treasurer, Mrs. K. H. De Woody; auditors, Mrs. M. Caswell and\r\nMrs. Louise Harden.\r\n\r\nThe second convention was held at Fairmont in January, 1897, Mrs.\r\nCarrie Chapman Catt, chairman of the national organization committee,\r\nassisting. Everything was so new that her presence and instruction\r\nwere an inspiration and a help, without which it is doubtful whether\r\nthe work would have continued. Officers were elected as follows:\r\nPresident. Mrs. Fannie J. Wheat; vice-president, Mrs. Mackie M.\r\nHolbert; recording secretary, Mrs. Beulah Boyd Ritchie; auditors, Mrs.\r\nMary Long Parson and Mrs. Mary Butcher; member national executive\r\ncommittee, Mrs. Mary H. Grove. The corresponding secretary and the\r\ntreasurer were re-elected.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1898, the annual meeting was held at Wheeling, in the\r\nCarroll Club Auditorium. Mrs. Chapman Catt and the Rev. Anna Howard\r\nShaw, vice-president-at-large of the National Association, made\r\naddresses each afternoon and evening, and both filled the pulpit of\r\nthe large Methodist Church on Sunday. All the officers were re-elected\r\nexcept the treasurer, who was succeeded by Miss J. B. Wilson.\r\n\r\nThe next convention took place at Fairmont in the fall of 1899, Mrs.\r\nChapman Catt again assisting to make it a success. The officers\r\nelected were: President, Mrs. Ritchie; vice-president, Mr. Harmer;\r\ncorresponding secretary, Mrs. Boyd; recording secretary, Miss Clara\r\nReinheimer; treasurer, Mrs. Holbert; auditors, Mrs. Georgia G. Clayton\r\nand Mrs. Belle McKinney; member national executive committee, Mrs.\r\nWheat; press superintendent, Mrs. Manley.\r\n\r\nPrior to 1895, the subject of the enfranchisement of women was\r\npractically unknown in West Virginia, but now there is no part of the\r\nState in which the injustice and ignominy of their disfranchisement\r\nhas not been brought to the mind and conscience of the voters.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION AND LAWS: In 1897 the Legislature appointed a\r\ncommittee to draw up a new State constitution, and the suffragists\r\npresented to it a petition, signed by about 600 leading men and women,\r\nasking that the word \"male\" be omitted from the suffrage clause.\r\nIndividual appeals were made and literature sent to each member of the\r\ncommittee. Many signatures for the petition were obtained at the State\r\nFair, held in Wheeling, where room for a suffrage booth in the\r\nManufacturer's Building was given by the president of the board, Anton\r\nReymann, while every other foot of space was rented out at a large\r\nprice. The booth was decorated with portraits of the leaders, Susan B.\r\nAnthony and Elizabeth Cady Stanton, and made as attractive as\r\npossible.\r\n\r\nIn 1899 the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw addressed a joint session of both\r\nHouses of the Legislature in behalf of the enfranchisement of women.\r\nHer expenses were paid by the Fairmont suffrage club.[462] The lecture\r\nwas a decided success, many members of the Legislature expressing\r\nthemselves as favorable to the cause she advocated. The clause\r\nstriking out the word \"male\" was not, however, reported from the\r\ncommittee, and the whole matter of a new constitution eventually was\r\ndropped.[463]\r\n\r\nBy an Act of 1891, no child under 12 years of age, of either sex, can\r\nbe employed in any mine, factory or workshop.\r\n\r\nBy an Act of 1893 a married woman may carry on business in her own\r\nname, and her earnings and all property, real and personal, purchased\r\nby her with the proceeds of such earnings, is in all cases her sole\r\nand separate property and not subject to the control or disposal of\r\nher husband or liable for his debts. By another act of this year a\r\nmarried woman may sue and be sued in any court in her own name.\r\n\r\nBy an Act of 1895, a married woman may appoint an attorney in fact to\r\nexecute any deed or other writing.\r\n\r\nBy an Act of 1899 employers are required to provide seats for female\r\nemployes.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy both obtain. The widower has a life interest in all\r\nhis wife's real estate, whether they have had children or not. The\r\nwidow has a life interest in one-third of her husband's real estate,\r\nif there are children living. If there are neither descendants nor\r\nkindred, the entire real estate of a husband or wife dying without a\r\nwill goes to the survivor. If there are children living, the widow or\r\nwidower has one-third of the personal property, and all of it if there\r\nare none. A homestead to the value of $1,000 is exempted for either.\r\n\r\nIf a child die possessed of property and without descendants or a will\r\nthe father is heir to all of it; if he is dead, the mother inherits\r\nonly an equal share with each of the remaining children. If both\r\nparents and all brothers and sisters are dead, the grandfather is the\r\nsole heir; he failing the grandmother shares equally with her\r\nsurviving children.\r\n\r\nThe husband can convey his separate property without his wife's\r\nsignature. The wife can not sell or encumber her separate property\r\nwithout her husband's consent.\r\n\r\nThe father is the legal guardian of the minor children. If a widow\r\nremarry the guardianship of the children of the first husband passes\r\nto the second, and she can not even appoint a guardian at her death.\r\nNo married woman can be a guardian.\r\n\r\nThe husband is required to furnish support adequate to his property\r\nand position in life.\r\n\r\nIn 1897 the legal age of marriage for girls was raised from twelve to\r\nsixteen years.\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" remains at 12 years. Formerly the penalty was\r\ndeath or, in the discretion of the jury, imprisonment for not less\r\nthan seven nor more than twenty years. In 1891 it was enacted that it\r\nmight be regarded as a felony and punished by imprisonment in the\r\npenitentiary not less than two nor more than ten years. Through the\r\nefforts of women bills to raise the age have been repeatedly\r\nintroduced but always have been defeated.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women possess no form of suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: In 1887 Dr. Harriet B. Jones was appointed assistant\r\nhospital physician in the State insane asylum, with the same salary\r\npaid the men physicians. She was the first woman ever appointed to\r\nsuch a position in a State institution in West Virginia. On her\r\nresignation she was succeeded by Dr. Luella F. Bullard, who still\r\nholds the office.\r\n\r\nTo the untiring energy of Dr. Jones is due the State Industrial Home\r\nfor Girls. During two sessions of the Legislature she remained at the\r\ncapital, entirely at her own expense and leaving a lucrative practice,\r\nto urge the need of this institution. At length $10,000 were\r\nappropriated for this purpose in 1897 and $20,000 more in 1899. Now a\r\ngirl committing a minor offense is no longer placed in jail or in the\r\npenitentiary while her brother for the same misdeed is sent to the\r\nReform School. Dr. Jones was elected president and all the officers\r\nare women.\r\n\r\nThe State Home for Incurables also represents the work and ability of\r\na woman, Mrs. Joseph Ruffner. Before the same Legislatures as Dr.\r\nJones, she appeared with a bill asking an appropriation, and by\r\npersistence secured one of $66,000. The home is now in successful\r\noperation with Mrs. Ruffner as president. The Governor is required to\r\nappoint boards composed equally of men and women for these two\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nWomen sit also on the boards of orphan asylums, day nurseries and\r\nhomes for the friendless.\r\n\r\nThe Humane Society of Wheeling was organized in 1896 with Mrs. Harriet\r\nG. List as president. In 1899 she secured an appropriation of $3,000\r\nfrom the Legislature to aid in its work.\r\n\r\nA woman is librarian on the staff of the Agricultural Experiment\r\nStation. The board of education of Wheeling appoints the three\r\nlibrarians in the public library, which is supported from the school\r\nfund, and for several years all of these have been women.\r\n\r\nIn some parts of the State women are appointed examiners to decide on\r\nthe fitness of applicants to teach in the public schools, but they can\r\nnot sit on school boards.\r\n\r\nWomen can not serve as notaries public.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to women\r\nexcept that of mining.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All institutions of learning are open to both sexes alike.\r\nBethany College has admitted women for more than ten years, and four\r\nare on the faculty. In 1897 the State University was made\r\nco-educational, after much opposition. It has eight women on its\r\nfaculty, and two of the three members of its library staff are women.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 4,096 men and 2,712 women teachers. It\r\nis impossible to obtain the average salaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[461] The History is indebted for this chapter to Mrs. Annie Caldwell\r\nBoyd of Wheeling, who has been an officer continuously in the State\r\nWoman Suffrage Association since it was organized.\r\n\r\n[462] This club raised money by suppers, festivals and a Woman's\r\nExchange for use in the work. It subscribed for twenty-five copies of\r\nthe _Woman's Journal_ to be sent to the State University, to the six\r\nNormal Schools and to various individuals. It also offered $35 in\r\nprizes for the best orations on The Enfranchisement of Women, to be\r\ncompeted for by the students of the above schools.\r\n\r\n[463] In the Legislature of 1901 a bill was introduced conferring on\r\nwomen the right to vote for Presidential electors, as this can be done\r\nby the legislators without a reference to the voters. The bill was\r\ndrawn up by George E. Boyd, Sr. It was reported by the House Judiciary\r\nCommittee, February 21, with the recommendation \"that it do not pass.\"\r\nHenry C. Hervey spoke strongly in its favor and was ably seconded by\r\nS. G. Smith, who closed by demanding the ayes and noes on the\r\nSpeaker's question, \"Shall the bill be rejected?\" The ayes were 31,\r\nnoes 25, the bill being defeated by six votes. Speaker William G.\r\nWilson voted against it.\r\n\r\nThe bill was presented in the Senate by Nelson Whittaker, but U. S.\r\nSenator Stephen B. Elkins came on from Washington and commanded that\r\nit be tabled, which was done.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXI.\r\n\r\nWISCONSIN.[464]\r\n\r\n\r\nAs a Territory Wisconsin interested herself in equal rights. In the\r\nfirst Constitutional Convention universal suffrage regardless of sex\r\nor color had a considerable vote. In the second woman suffrage\r\nreceived a certain amount of favorable consideration. Early in the\r\nhistory of the State widows were made heirs of all the property in\r\ncase of the death of the husband without children, and laws were\r\npassed by which a life interest in the homestead was secured to the\r\nwife. In 1851 the regents of the State University declared that their\r\nplan \"contemplated the admission of women,\" and in 1869 women were\r\nmade eligible to all school offices.\r\n\r\nThe first Woman Suffrage Association was organized in 1869 as a result\r\nof a large convention in Milwaukee, arranged by Dr. Laura Ross and\r\nMiss Lily Peckham, a bright young lawyer, and addressed by Mrs.\r\nElizabeth Cady Stanton, Mrs. Mary A. Livermore, Miss Susan B. Anthony\r\nand others. Soon after this several local societies were organized.\r\nIts annual meetings since 1883 have been held as follows: 1884,\r\nRichland Center; 1885, Whitewater; 1886, Racine; 1887, Madison; 1888,\r\nStevens' Point; 1889, Milwaukee; 1890, Berlin; 1891, Menominee; 1892,\r\nRichland Center; 1893, Mukwonago; 1894, Racine; 1895, Evansville;\r\n1896, Waukesha; 1897, Monroe; 1898, Spring Green; 1899, Platteville;\r\n1900, Brodhead.\r\n\r\nThe president during 1884 was Mrs. Emma C. Bascom, wife of the\r\npresident of the State University. On leaving for the East she was\r\nsucceeded by the Rev. Olympia Brown, who has been re-elected every\r\nyear since.[465] Mrs. Brown was called to the pastorate of the\r\nUniversalist Church of Racine in 1878, and during her nine years of\r\nservice there held occasional meetings in behalf of woman suffrage in\r\nvarious parts of the State.\r\n\r\nIn addition to annual conventions numerous conferences have been held,\r\ntoo many and too similar in character to make a detailed history of\r\nthem essential. In the winter of 1884 a course of lectures was given\r\nin Racine on subjects relating to women by Mrs. Mary A. Livermore,\r\nMrs. Julia Ward Howe, Mrs. Mary E. Haggart, Mrs. May Wright Sewall and\r\nMrs. J. G. McMurphy.\r\n\r\nIn November, 1886, Mrs. Brown held a series of nine district\r\nconventions in company with Miss Anthony and Mrs. Clara Bewick Colby.\r\nOn November 1 she received a telegram from Miss Anthony, then in\r\nKansas, saying that they would join in holding conventions in all the\r\ncongressional districts beginning on the 8th. This seemed a very short\r\ntime in which to prepare for such a campaign, but by the president's\r\ndeciding on places and dates without consultation, sending posters to\r\nthe different towns selected and announcements to all the papers of\r\nthe State, and then going in person to secure halls and make local\r\narrangements, the date named found a tolerable degree of preparation.\r\nThe canvass opened with a large reception at the home of Mrs. M. B.\r\nErskine in Racine, which was followed by conventions at Waukesha,\r\nRipon, Oshkosh, Green Bay, Grand Rapids, Eau Claire, La Crosse,\r\nEvansville and Madison. At the last place the ladies spoke in the\r\nSenate Chamber to a distinguished audience. The effect of these\r\nmeetings was marked. Many members were added to the State association,\r\nbranches were organized and an impetus given to the work such as never\r\nwas known before and has not been repeated. Since then many\r\nconventions have been held by the president of the association, its\r\nseveral lecturers and outside speakers.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the suffrage association kept open house for ten days at the\r\nManona Lake Assembly; during this time the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw,\r\nnational vice-president-at-large, gave one of the Chautauqua lectures\r\nto an audience of 4,000 people.\r\n\r\nIn 1898 a conference was held in Madison by the officers of the\r\nNational Association, attended by the State Executive Board and\r\nrepresentatives of various societies.\r\n\r\nThe Rev. Ella Bartlett, the Rev. Nellie Mann Opdale and the Rev. Alice\r\nBall Loomis have each served as State lecturer for two or more years\r\nand proved most efficient. Mrs. Emma Smith DeVoe has also lectured in\r\nthe State during several different seasons with excellent effect.\r\n\r\nAmong those who have aided in the work in an early day may be\r\nmentioned Madame Mathilde F. Anneke, Dr. Laura Ross Wolcott, Mrs. Ella\r\nPartridge, Mrs. Emeline Wolcott; and later Mrs. Lephia O. Brown, the\r\nmother, and J. H. Willis, the husband, of the Rev. Olympia Brown.[466]\r\n\r\nProf. Henry Doty Maxon stands pre-eminent among the men who have\r\nassisted the cause. He was pastor of the Unitarian Church at Menominee\r\nand vice-president of the State Suffrage Association for a number of\r\nyears, attended the annual meetings regularly and himself arranged one\r\nof the most successful, which was held in his church, known as the\r\nMabel Taintor Memorial Hall. Col. J. G. McMynn exerted an influence in\r\nfavor of woman's advancement, at an early day. Many men have aided by\r\ngiving money and influence, among them State Senator Norman James,\r\nDavid B. James, Capt. Andrew Taintor, the Hon. T. B. Wilson, Burr\r\nSprague, M. B. Erskine, the Hon. W. T. Lewis, Steven Bull, the Hon.\r\nIsaac Stevenson, U. S. Senator Philetus Sawyer and Judge Hamilton of\r\nNeenah. The clergy generally have assisted by giving their churches\r\nfor meetings. The Richland Center Club and the Greene County Equal\r\nRights Association deserve special mention for their faithfulness and\r\ngenerosity. The Suffrage Club of Platteville is also very active.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important features of the work has been the\r\npublication of the _Wisconsin Citizen_, a monthly paper devoted to\r\nthe interests of women. It was started in 1887 to educate the people\r\non the suffrage bill of 1885 and has continued ever since, no other\r\none influence having been so helpful to the cause. The association\r\nowes this paper to Mrs. Martha Parker Dingee, a niece of Theodore\r\nParker, who edited it for seven years, reading all the proofs, without\r\nhelp and without remuneration; and to Mrs. Helen H. Charlton who has\r\nedited and published the paper from 1894 to the present time.\r\n\r\nMiss Sarah H. Richards compiled and published an interesting history\r\nand directory of the Wisconsin Woman Suffrage Association to which the\r\npresent sketch is much indebted.\r\n\r\nLEGISLATIVE ACTION: Only one measure looking to the extension of\r\nsuffrage to women ever has been passed by the Legislature. This was\r\ndone in 1885 as the result of the efforts of Alura Collins Hollister,\r\nwho was appointed to represent the association in legislative work at\r\nMadison. The following was submitted to the voters: \"Every woman who\r\nis a citizen of this State of the age of twenty-one years and upward,\r\nexcept paupers, etc., who has resided within the State one year and in\r\nthe election district where she offers to vote ten days next preceding\r\nany election pertaining to school matters, shall have the right to\r\nvote at such election.\" This was discussed at length in both branches\r\nof the Legislature and passed on March 13 by a large majority.\r\n\r\nIt was voted upon at the fall election in 1886 receiving a majority of\r\n4,583, and thus became a law.[467]\r\n\r\nIt will be noted that this law specifies what women are to vote, viz.:\r\nactual citizens who are not paupers; where women are to vote, viz.: in\r\nthe election districts where they reside; when women are to vote,\r\nviz.: when there is an election pertaining to school matters. It does\r\nnot specify what women are to vote upon or for whom--they are full\r\nvoters without limitation at all elections pertaining to school\r\nmatters. What elections pertain to school matters? First, the general\r\nelection held once in two years, at which the State Superintendent of\r\nPublic Instruction and officers controlling the State University and\r\nother State institutions are chosen. Second, the municipal election\r\nwhich in most cities pertains to school matters, as a school board or\r\nsuperintendent is chosen then. Third, other elections in country\r\nvillages where one or more school officers are chosen. Fourth, special\r\nelections where subjects relating to schools are voted upon. Of\r\nseveral suffrage bills reported at this session this one, called the\r\nGinty Bill, was the only one which provided for a submission of the\r\nquestion to the voters, which shows the purpose of the framers to have\r\nbeen to grant State or national suffrage. The broad scope of this law\r\npractically giving women a vote on the election of all national, State\r\nand municipal officers, was pointed out to the leaders of the suffrage\r\nassociation by some of the men instrumental in its passage, notably\r\nSenator Norman James, chairman of the Joint Special Committee that\r\nreported the bill. It is claimed that the Legislature did not intend\r\nto pass a law so far reaching, but the circumstances of its passage,\r\npolitical conditions at the time, as well as the statements of its\r\nmembers and of the committee, show that they did intend to pass this\r\nbroad, far-reaching law, giving suffrage to women.\r\n\r\nTo awaken women to the necessity of voting at the first\r\nopportunity--the municipal election in 1887--the suffrage association\r\nundertook an active canvass of the State which lasted without\r\ninterruption until the autumn of 1888, a period of over two years. The\r\nRev. Olympia Brown gave up her church in Racine and devoted herself\r\nexclusively to the work. The association was assisted by Miss Anthony,\r\nMrs. Livermore, Mrs. Elizabeth Lyle Saxon, Mrs. Elizabeth Boynton\r\nHarbert and Mrs. Catharine Waugh McCulloch. Some of these speakers\r\nremained a month, others a week and some only for two or three\r\nlectures. The State president attended every meeting.\r\n\r\nOn the morning of the election in April, 1887, Attorney-General\r\nCharles B. Estabrook sent out telegrams to those places where he\r\nsupposed women would be likely to vote, ordering the inspectors to\r\nreject their ballots, which was done; but where they were not advised\r\nby him the ballots of women were accepted.\r\n\r\nThe next effort of the suffrage leaders was to instruct the people in\r\nthe law and the circumstances of its passage, and thus to inspire\r\nconfidence in spite of the refusal of the ballots. It was suggested\r\nthat as the Presidential election was near at hand, politicians would\r\nnot leave it uncertain as to whether or not women were entitled to\r\nvote, but would secure an interpretation of the law from the Supreme\r\nCourt without proper argument and presentation of the facts, hence the\r\nState W. S. A. decided to test the matter itself. The case was brought\r\nby Mrs. Brown against the election inspectors in Racine for refusing\r\nto accept her vote, and was ably argued before Judge John B. Winslow\r\nof the Circuit Court, now a member of the Supreme Court of Wisconsin.\r\nHe overruled the demurrer of the inspectors, stating that women were\r\nentitled to vote at that election and for all candidates, thus\r\nconfirming the law.\r\n\r\nAn appeal was immediately taken by the inspectors to the Supreme\r\nCourt, and in order to keep the subject before the people and to\r\ncreate a favorable public sentiment the association continued its\r\ncanvass by distributing literature and giving lectures. The decision\r\nrendered Jan. 31, 1888, was written by Justice John B. Cassody and was\r\nso vague and loosely worded that lawyers were not agreed as to its\r\nmeaning. He reversed the finding of the lower court, however,\r\ndeclaring the intent of the law to be to confer School Suffrage\r\nonly.[468]\r\n\r\nThe association now found itself confronted by a large debt, the whole\r\nsuit having cost about $1,500, but by active work the autumn of 1888\r\nfound everything paid. In all this Mrs. Almeda B. Gray, one of the\r\nofficers of the association, was a leading spirit, contributing\r\nlargely in time and money; Mrs. M. A. Fowler worked night and day,\r\nmaking routes for speakers and planning the campaign, other women\r\nassisted according to their ability and the club at Richland Center\r\ndid excellent service. The decision still left room for litigation,\r\nthe claim being made that the ruling of the Supreme Court plainly\r\nrecognized the right of women to vote provided their ballots were put\r\nin a separate box.\r\n\r\nIn the following November Wm. A. McKinley was elected Superintendent\r\nof Schools for Oconto County by the votes of women placed in a\r\nseparate box. His election was contested and the case was argued\r\nbefore Judge Samuel B. Hastings of Green Bay, who, quoting from the\r\ndecision of Judge Cassody, decided that women had a right to vote\r\nprovided their ballots were put into a separate box. This case also\r\nwas appealed to the Supreme Court, where the decision, rendered by\r\nJudge William P. Lyon, Jan. 26, 1890, was that the votes of the women\r\nin Oconto County were illegally counted. The ground for this finding\r\nwas that further legislative action was necessary before separate\r\nballot-boxes could be legally provided. Judge Cassody dissented from\r\nthis opinion.\r\n\r\nThe law then became practically a dead letter, except in a few\r\ninstances, until 1901, when an Act of the Legislature provided for\r\nseparate ballot boxes for women, and in the spring of 1902 they voted\r\non school questions.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 the legislative committee, consisting of Mrs. Jennie\r\nLamberson, Mrs. Jessie Luther and Mrs. Alice Kollock, assisted by Mrs.\r\nCharlton, secured the introduction of two bills--one to strike the\r\nword \"male\" from the State constitution, the other for a suffrage\r\namendment by statute law. A hearing was granted before the joint\r\ncommittee of both Houses in the Senate Chamber, which was crowded.\r\nMesdames Elizabeth Boynton Harbert (Ills.), Helen H. Charlton, Nellie\r\nMann Opdale, Ellen A. Rose and Dr. Annette J. Shaw were the\r\nspeakers.[469] The bills were reported favorably but were lost after\r\ndiscussion.\r\n\r\nLAWS: Dower and curtesy obtain. A widow is entitled to a life interest\r\nin one-third of the real estate and, if the husband die without a\r\nwill, to the share of a child in the personal estate. If there is no\r\nlawful issue she has the entire estate, both real and personal. The\r\nwidower has a life interest in all the real estate of his wife not\r\ndisposed of by will, or in all of it if the wife died intestate,\r\nunless she left issue by a former husband, in which case such issue\r\ntakes it, free from the right of the surviving husband to hold the\r\nsame by curtesy. If the wife die without a will and leave no issue,\r\nthe widower is entitled to the entire estate, both real and personal.\r\nThere may also be reserved for the widow a homestead of not more than\r\nforty acres of farm land, or one-quarter of an acre in a town, which\r\nat her subsequent marriage or death passes to the heirs of the former\r\nhusband. If none exist she does not lose her homestead rights by\r\nmarrying again.\r\n\r\nThe wife may dispose of all her real estate by conveyance during her\r\nlifetime or by will, without the husband's consent. He can not destroy\r\nher dower rights.\r\n\r\nA married woman may sue and be sued, make contracts and carry on\r\nbusiness in her own name.\r\n\r\nThe father, if living, and in case of his death the mother, while she\r\nremains unmarried, shall be entitled to the custody of the persons and\r\neducation of the minor children. The father may by will appoint a\r\nguardian for a child, whether born or unborn, to continue during its\r\nminority or for a less time.\r\n\r\nNeglect to provide for a wife and minor children is a misdemeanor,\r\npunished by imprisonment in the county jail not less than fifteen\r\ndays, during ten days of which food may be bread and water only; or by\r\nimprisonment in the penitentiary not exceeding one year, or in the\r\ncounty workhouse, at the discretion of the court.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 a law was passed raising the \"age of protection\" for girls\r\nfrom 10 to 14 years. In 1889 this was amended by lowering the age to\r\n12 and reducing the punishment from imprisonment for life to not more\r\nthan thirty-five nor less than five years. The clause also was added:\r\n\"Provided that if the child shall be a common prostitute, the man\r\nshall be imprisoned in the penitentiary not less than one year nor\r\nmore than seven.\"[470] In 1895 the age was raised again to 14 years\r\nwith the same penalty.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: By the law of 1885 every woman who is a citizen of this\r\nState of the age of twenty-one years and upwards, except paupers,\r\netc., who has resided in the State for one year and in the election\r\ndistrict where she offers to vote ten days next preceding any election\r\npertaining to school matters, shall have a right to vote at such\r\nelection. By the present interpretation of this law the suffrage of\r\nwomen is limited to school officers and questions. Suffrage may be\r\nextended by statute but such law must be ratified by a majority of the\r\nvoters at a general election.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: There is no law authorizing women to hold any elective\r\noffice except such as pertains to schools, but they have been eligible\r\nto these since 1869. Eighteen women have served as county\r\nsuperintendents at the same time; nine are acting at present. They sit\r\non school boards in a number of cities.\r\n\r\nIn the Legislature women act as enrolling and engrossing clerks, and\r\nas clerks and stenographers to committees. They are also found as\r\nclerks, copyists and stenographers in the various elective and\r\nappointive State, city and county offices.\r\n\r\nIn the State institutions they are employed as teachers, matrons,\r\nbookkeepers, supervisors, State agents for placing dependent children,\r\netc. The Milwaukee Industrial School for Girls, supported partly by\r\npublic and partly by private funds, is the only institution managed\r\nentirely by women.\r\n\r\nThere are no women physicians at any of the State institutions. One\r\nwoman was appointed county physician in Waukesha, and one or two have\r\nbeen made city physicians.\r\n\r\nThe office of police matron was established by city ordinance in\r\nMilwaukee in 1884. There is none in any other city.\r\n\r\nWomen act as notaries public and court commissioners.\r\n\r\nWomen could not sit on any State Boards until the Legislature of 1901\r\nauthorized the appointment of one woman on the Board of Regents for\r\nthe State University, and one on that of the State Normal School. It\r\nalso authorized the appointment of a woman State Factory Inspector.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: No profession or occupation is legally forbidden to\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: In 1851 the regents of the State University took a stand in\r\nfavor of co-education. In 1866 an Act reorganizing the university\r\ndeclared that in all its departments it should be opened to male and\r\nfemale students; but owing to prejudices it was not until 1873 that\r\ncomplete co-education was established, although women were graduated\r\nin 1869. All institutions of learning are open alike to both sexes.\r\n\r\nIn the public schools there are 2,654 men and 9,811 women teachers.\r\nThe average monthly salary of the men is $41; of the women, $29.50.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[464] The History is indebted for most of the material in this chapter\r\nto the Rev.

Leighton and Minnie Stebbins Savage.\r\n\r\n[467] The State constitution provides that the suffrage may be\r\nextended by a law submitted to the electors at any general election.\r\nIf it receives a majority vote it is held to have the force of a\r\nconstitutional amendment.\r\n\r\n[468] The open letter addressed to Judge Cassody, March 28, 1888, by\r\nMrs. Brown, in regard to this decision, was pronounced by the best\r\nlawyers as unsurpassed in logic, legal acumen, keen sarcasm and\r\nrighteous indignation. [Eds.\r\n\r\n[469] E. P. Wilder, associate editor of the Madison _State Journal_,\r\nchief official organ of the Republican party, made an excellent\r\naddress at this time in favor of woman suffrage, which was afterwards\r\nprinted as a leaflet.\r\n\r\n[470] This is believed to be the only case on record where the age of\r\nprotection has been lowered. The amendment was urged by Senator P. J.\r\nClawson of Monroe, Green County At its next meeting the county\r\nsuffrage society passed the strongest possible denunciatory\r\nresolutions, and thereafter its members worked diligently to defeat\r\nMr. Clawson for the nomination to Congress, which they succeeded in\r\ndoing.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXII.\r\n\r\nWYOMING.[471]\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is said that a contented people or a happy life is one without a\r\nhistory. The cause of woman suffrage in Wyoming has not been marked by\r\nagitation or strife, and for that reason there is no struggle to\r\nrecord, as is the case in all other States. In its story Mrs. Esther\r\nMorris must ever be considered the heroine. A native of New York, she\r\njoined her husband and three sons in 1869 at South Pass, then the\r\nchief town of Wyoming. She was a strong advocate of the\r\nenfranchisement of women and succeeded in enlisting the co-operation\r\nof Col. William H. Bright, president of the first Legislative Council\r\nof the Territory, which that very year passed a bill conferring on\r\nwomen the full elective franchise and the right to hold all offices.\r\nGov. John A. Campbell was in some doubt as to signing it, but a body\r\nof women in Cheyenne, headed by Mrs. Amalia Post (wife of Morton E.\r\nPost, delegate to Congress), went to his residence and announced their\r\nintention of staying until he did so. A vacancy occurring soon\r\nafterward in the office of Justice of the Peace at South Pass, the\r\nGovernor appointed Mrs. Morris on petition of the county attorney and\r\ncommissioners. She tried between thirty and forty cases and none was\r\nappealed to a higher court.[472]\r\n\r\nIn 1871 a bill to repeal this woman suffrage law was passed by the\r\nLegislature and vetoed by Governor Campbell. An attempt to pass it\r\nover his veto failed. No proposition to abolish it ever was made in\r\nthe Legislature thereafter.\r\n\r\nIn 1884, fifteen years after women had first voted in Wyoming, U. S.\r\nDistrict Attorney Melville C. Brown, at the request of Miss Susan B.\r\nAnthony, sent to the National Association an extended résumé of the\r\nstatus of women suffrage in the Territory, to which he himself had\r\nbeen opposed in 1869. It expressed throughout the most emphatic\r\napproval without any qualifications. Some of the statements were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     Women have exercised their elective franchise, at first not very\r\n     generally but of late with universality, and with such good\r\n     judgment and modesty as to commend it to the men of all parties\r\n     who hold the good of the Territory in high esteem.... It has been\r\n     stated that the best women do not avail themselves of the\r\n     privilege. This is maliciously false.... The foolish claim has\r\n     also been made that the influence of the ballot upon women is\r\n     bad. This is not true. It is impossible that a woman's character\r\n     can be contaminated in associating with men for a few minutes in\r\n     going to the polls any more than it would be in going to church\r\n     or to places of amusement. On the other hand women are benefited\r\n     and improved by the ballot.... The fact is, Wyoming has the\r\n     noblest and best women in the world because they have more\r\n     privileges and know better how to use them.\r\n\r\n     To conclude I will say: Woman suffrage is a settled fact here,\r\n     and will endure as long as the Territory. It has accomplished\r\n     much good; it has harmed no one; therefore we are all in favor,\r\n     and none can be found to raise a voice against it.\r\n\r\nIn the convention called the first Monday of September, 1889, to\r\nprepare a constitution for admission as a State, this was the first\r\nclause presented for consideration:\r\n\r\n     The right of citizens of the State of Wyoming to vote and hold\r\n     office shall not be denied or abridged on account of sex. Both\r\n     male and female citizens of this State shall enjoy all civil,\r\n     political and religious rights and privileges.\r\n\r\nAfter just twenty years' experience of woman suffrage no man in this\r\nconvention was found in opposition to it, but to the surprise of the\r\nmembers, one delegate, A. C. Campbell of Laramie, proposed to amend\r\nthis section by making it a separate article to be voted upon apart\r\nfrom the rest of the constitution. He supported his amendment by a\r\nlong speech in which he said that he himself should vote in favor of\r\nthe article and, from his observations throughout the Territory, he\r\nbelieved two-thirds or more of the people would do the same, but he\r\nthought they ought to have a chance to express themselves; that \"they\r\nwere going to have a pretty tough time anyhow getting into the Union,\r\nand if they put in a proposition of this kind without giving those\r\npersons who were opposed to woman suffrage a chance to express\r\nthemselves, they would vote against the whole constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe other members of the convention looked upon this as a scheme of\r\nthe opponents, and Mr. Campbell had no support to his proposition. On\r\nthe contrary, the most eloquent addresses were made by George W.\r\nBaxter, Henry A. Coffeen, C. W. Holden, Asbury B. Conaway, Melville C.\r\nBrown, Charles H. Burritt and John W. Hoyt demanding that the suffrage\r\nclause should stand in the constitution regardless of consequences.\r\nSpace will permit only the keynote of these courageous speeches.[473]\r\n\r\n     MR. BAXTER: ... I defend this because it is right, because it is\r\n     fair, because it is just.... I shall ever regard as a\r\n     distinguished honor my membership in this convention, which, for\r\n     the first time in the history of all this broad land, rising\r\n     above the prejudice and injustice of the past, will incorporate\r\n     into the fundamental law of the State a provision that shall\r\n     secure to every citizen within her borders not only the\r\n     protection of the courts, but the absolute and equal enjoyment of\r\n     every right and privilege guaranteed under the law to any other\r\n     citizen.\r\n\r\n     MR. COFFEEN: ... The question, as I take it, is already settled\r\n     in the hearts and minds and judgments of the people of our\r\n     glorious State proposed-to-be, and shall we stand here to-day and\r\n     debate over it when every element of justice and right and\r\n     equality is in its favor; when not one iota of weight of argument\r\n     has been brought against it; when every word that can be said is\r\n     in favor of continuing the good results of woman suffrage, which\r\n     we have experienced for twenty years?... I shall not go into the\r\n     policy or propriety of submitting such a proposition as this now\r\n     before us to the people of this Territory....\r\n\r\n     MR. HOLDEN: I do not desire at this time to offer any reason why\r\n     the right to vote should be granted to women; that is not the\r\n     question before us. The question is, shall we secure that right\r\n     by fundamental law? The proposition now under consideration is,\r\n     shall we leave it to the people of Wyoming to say whether or not\r\n     the privilege of voting shall be secured to women? Now, Mr.\r\n     Chairman, I believe that I voice the wishes of my constituency\r\n     when I say that rather than surrender the right which the women\r\n     of this Territory have so long enjoyed--and which they have used\r\n     not only with credit to themselves but with profit to the country\r\n     in which they live--I say that rather than surrender that right\r\n     we will remain in a Territorial condition throughout the endless\r\n     cycles of time.\r\n\r\n     MR. CONAWAY: ... The sentiment of this convention, and I believe\r\n     of the people whom we represent, is so nearly unanimous that\r\n     extended discussion, it seems to me, would be a waste of\r\n     time.... If it were proposed to submit to a vote of the people\r\n     whether the property of the gentleman from Laramie should be\r\n     taken from him, or my property should be taken from me and given\r\n     to somebody else, there would be no difference of opinion upon\r\n     it. In Wyoming this right of our women has been recognized, has\r\n     been enjoyed; there are such things in law as vested rights, and\r\n     the decisions of our courts are unanimous that it is not within\r\n     the power of the Legislature ever to take away from any person\r\n     his rights or his property and to confer them upon another, and\r\n     that is what this clause proposes to do, to submit to a vote\r\n     whether we shall take away from one-half of our citizens--and, as\r\n     my friend has well stated, the better half--a certain right, and\r\n     increase the rights of the other half by so doing....\r\n\r\n     MR. BROWN: I was a member of that second Legislature which tried\r\n     to disfranchise women.... From that day to the present no man in\r\n     the Legislature of Wyoming has been heard to lift his voice\r\n     against woman suffrage. It has become one of the fundamental laws\r\n     of the land, and to raise any question about it at this time is\r\n     as improper, in my judgment, as to raise a question as to any\r\n     other fundamental right guaranteed to any citizen in this\r\n     Territory. I would sooner think, Mr. Chairman, of submitting to\r\n     the people of Wyoming a separate and distinct proposition as to\r\n     whether a male citizen of the Territory shall be entitled to\r\n     vote....\r\n\r\n     MR. HOYT: ... For twenty years the women of this Territory have\r\n     taken part with the men in its government, and have exercised\r\n     this right of suffrage equally with them, and we are all proud of\r\n     the results. No man in Wyoming ever has dared to say that woman\r\n     suffrage is a failure. There has been no disturbance of the\r\n     domestic relations, there has been no diminution of the social\r\n     order, there has been no lessening of the dignity which\r\n     characterizes the exercise of the elective franchise; there have\r\n     been, on the contrary, an improvement of the social order, better\r\n     laws, better officials, a higher civilization. Why, then, this\r\n     extraordinary proposition that, after so many years, having\r\n     exercised with us the right of suffrage since the foundation of\r\n     this Territorial government, women are now to be singled out, to\r\n     be set aside, and the question submitted to a vote as to whether\r\n     they shall have a continuance of the rights which have been given\r\n     to them by unanimous consent, and which they have exercised\r\n     wisely and properly and, as my friend says, with profit to the\r\n     whole Territory? This is indeed an extraordinary proposition, to\r\n     submit to a vote the continuance of a vested right. I will not\r\n     impugn the motives of the gentleman who makes it, but I demand as\r\n     a matter of justice that it shall be voted down by an\r\n     overwhelming majority, and I would that he had never presented\r\n     it.... We are told that if we put this clause into our\r\n     constitution as a fundamental law, we shall fail to secure its\r\n     approval by the people of Wyoming and its acceptance by the\r\n     Congress of the United States; but if it should so prove that the\r\n     adoption of this provision to protect the rights of the women\r\n     should work against our admission, then I agree with my friend,\r\n     Mr. Holden, that we will remain out of the Union until a\r\n     sentiment of justice shall prevail....\r\n\r\n     MR. BURRITT: ... Mr. Campbell destroyed any argument that he made\r\n     in favor of this amendment by saying, first, that woman suffrage\r\n     as a principle is right; second, that he would vote for it if\r\n     presented to the people. And he further said that he was not\r\n     afraid, in defending the right of petition, to come before this\r\n     convention and indorse this proposition to be separately voted\r\n     upon, even if it cost him the ladies' vote or the votes of any\r\n     other class. That certainly is very courageous on the part of the\r\n     gentleman from Laramie.... But I will say this much in addition,\r\n     which he did not say, that, as a member of this convention and\r\n     believing the right of suffrage to be a vested right, of which it\r\n     would be wrong and wicked for us to attempt to deprive women, I\r\n     have also the courage to rise above the single constituent that I\r\n     have in Johnson County who is opposed to woman suffrage (and I\r\n     know but one) and to rise above the majority even of its citizens\r\n     if I knew they were opposed, and I am sure that this convention\r\n     and this State have as much courage as I have. Believing that\r\n     woman suffrage is right, I am sure that this convention has the\r\n     courage to go before Congress and say that if they will not let\r\n     us in with this plank in our State constitution we will stay out\r\n     forever.... I stand upon the platform of justice, and I advocate\r\n     the continuance of the right of women to vote and hold office and\r\n     enjoy equally with men all civil, religious and political\r\n     privileges, and that this right be incorporated as a part of the\r\n     fundamental law of the State....\r\n\r\nThe woman suffrage clause was retained as a part of the constitution,\r\nwhich was adopted by more than a three-fourths majority of the popular\r\nvote.\r\n\r\nA bill to provide for the admission of Wyoming as a State was\r\nintroduced into the House of Representatives on Dec. 18, 1889, and\r\nlater was favorably reported from the Committee on Territories by\r\nCharles S. Baker of New York. A minority report was presented by\r\nWilliam M. Springer of Illinois, consisting of twenty-three pages, two\r\ndevoted to various other reasons for non-admission and twenty-one to\r\nobjections because of the woman suffrage article.\r\n\r\nAs it was supposed that the new State would be Republican, a bitter\r\nfight was waged by the Democrats, using the provision for woman\r\nsuffrage as a club. The bill was grandly championed by Joseph M.\r\nCarey, delegate from the Territory (afterward United States senator)\r\nwho defended the suffrage clause with the same courage and ability as\r\nall the others in the constitution.[474]\r\n\r\nThe principal speech in opposition was by Joseph E. Washington of\r\nTennessee, who said in part:\r\n\r\n     My chief objection to the admission of Wyoming is the suffrage\r\n     article in the constitution. I am unalterably opposed to female\r\n     suffrage in any form. It can only result in the end in unsexing\r\n     and degrading the womanhood of America. It is emphatically a\r\n     reform against nature.... I have no doubt that in Wyoming to-day\r\n     women vote in as many [different] precincts as they can reach on\r\n     horseback or on foot after changing their frocks and bustles....\r\n     Tennessee has not yet adopted any of these new-fangled ideas, not\r\n     that we are lacking in respect for true and exalted\r\n     womanhood.[475]\r\n\r\nWilliam C. Oates of Alabama also delivered a long speech in\r\nopposition, of which the following is a specimen paragraph:\r\n\r\n     I like a woman who is a woman and appreciates the sphere to which\r\n     God and the Bible have assigned her. I do not like a man-woman.\r\n     She may be intelligent and full of learning, but when she assumes\r\n     the performance of the duties and functions assigned by nature to\r\n     man, she becomes rough and tough and can no longer be the object\r\n     of affection.\r\n\r\nHe concluded his argument by saying that if ever universal suffrage\r\nshould prevail the Government would break to pieces of its own weight.\r\n\r\nThe enfranchisement of women was also vehemently attacked by Alexander\r\nM. Dockery of Missouri, George T. Barnes of Georgia, William M.\r\nSpringer of Illinois, and William McAdoo of New Jersey. It was\r\nstrongly defended by Henry L. Morey of Ohio, Charles S. Baker of New\r\nYork, Daniel Kerr and I. S. Struble, both of Iowa, and Harrison B.\r\nKelley of Kansas.\r\n\r\nEvery possible effort was made to compel the adoption of an amendment\r\nlimiting the suffrage to male citizens, and it was defeated by only\r\nsix votes. The bill of admission was passed March 28, 1890, after\r\nthree days' discussion, by 139 ayes to 127 noes. During the progress\r\nof this debate Delegate Carey telegraphed to the Wyoming Legislature,\r\nthen in session, that it looked as if the suffrage clause would have\r\nto be abandoned if Statehood were to be obtained, and the answer came\r\nback: \"We will remain out of the Union a hundred years rather than\r\ncome in without woman suffrage.\"[476]\r\n\r\nIn the Senate the fight against the suffrage article was renewed with\r\nadded intensity. The bill for the admission of Wyoming was reported\r\nfavorably through the chairman of the Committee on Territories,\r\nOrville H. Platt of Connecticut, in January, 1890, but was not reached\r\non the calendar until February 17. On objection from Francis M.\r\nCockrell of Missouri, that there was not time then for its\r\nconsideration, it was postponed, but without losing its place on the\r\ncalendar. Not until May 2, however, did it come up again as unfinished\r\nbusiness, and only to be again postponed. On May 8 the bill was set\r\ndown for the following Monday, but it was June 25 before it finally\r\nreceived extended consideration. The debate continued for three days\r\nand the clause conferring suffrage on women took a prominent place.\r\n\r\nGeorge G. Vest of Missouri led the opposition and said in the course\r\nof his lengthy oration:\r\n\r\n     I shall never vote to admit into the Union any State that adopts\r\n     woman suffrage. I do not propose to discuss the sentimental side\r\n     of the question.... In my judgment woman suffrage is antagonistic\r\n     to the spirit, to the institutions, of the people of the United\r\n     States. It is utterly antagonistic to my ideas of the Government\r\n     as the fathers made it and left it to us. If there were no other\r\n     reason I would never give the right of suffrage to women because\r\n     the danger to the institutions of the United States to-day is in\r\n     hurried, spasmodic, sentimental suffrage.... I believe that with\r\n     universal suffrage in this country, the injecting into our\r\n     suffrage of all the women of the United States would be the\r\n     greatest calamity that could possibly happen to our institutions\r\n     and people.... If there were no other reason with me, I would\r\n     vote against the admission of Wyoming because it has that feature\r\n     in its constitution. I will not take the responsibility as a\r\n     senator of indorsing in any way, directly or indirectly, woman\r\n     suffrage. I repeat that in my judgment it would be not only a\r\n     calamity but an absolute crime against the institutions of the\r\n     people of the United States....\r\n\r\nIn an extended speech John H. Reagan of Texas said:\r\n\r\n     But what are we going to do, what are the people of this\r\n     Territory going to do, by the adoption of this constitution? They\r\n     are going to make men of women, and when they do that the\r\n     correlative must take place that men must become women. So I\r\n     suppose we are to have women for public officers, women to do\r\n     military duty, women to work the roads, women to fight the\r\n     battles of the country, and men to wash the dishes, men to nurse\r\n     the children, men to stay at home while the ladies go out and\r\n     make stump speeches in canvasses.... Mr. President, when the\r\n     Almighty created men and women He made them for different\r\n     purposes, and six thousand years of experience have recognized\r\n     the wisdom and justice of the Almighty in this arrangement. It is\r\n     only latterly that people have got wiser than their Creator and\r\n     wiser than all the generations which have preceded them.... The\r\n     constitution of society, the necessity for the existence of\r\n     society, the necessity of home government, which is the most\r\n     important of all the parts of government, can only be preserved\r\n     and perpetuated by keeping men in their sphere and women in their\r\n     sphere....\r\n\r\n     It is a wholesome thing to reflect that after a hard day's\r\n     struggle and of rough contacts which men must have with each\r\n     other, they can go to a home presided over by one there who\r\n     soothes the passions of the day by the sweetness of her temper,\r\n     the gentleness of her disposition and the happiness which she\r\n     brings around the family circle. But if the wife and the husband\r\n     are both out in the bitter contests of the day, making speeches,\r\n     electioneering with voters, pushing their way to the polls, they\r\n     will both be apt to go home in a bad humor, and there will not be\r\n     much happiness in a family during the remainder of the day which\r\n     follows such a scene. And while they are both out what will\r\n     become of the children? Are they to take care of themselves?\r\n\r\n     What rights can women expect to have that they do not have now?\r\n     They are clothed with the protection of law.[477] In my judgment,\r\n     Mr. President, the day that the floodgate of female suffrage is\r\n     opened upon this country, the social organism will have reached\r\n     the point at which decay and ruin begin.... Why, sir, what is the\r\n     advantage? If the head of the family votes he is apt to reflect\r\n     the views of the family. It is more convenient than to have all\r\n     the family going out to vote.\r\n\r\nWilbur F. Sanders of Montana interrupted Senator Reagan to ask if the\r\nlaw should not be an expression of the intellectual and moral sense of\r\nall the people, and whether governments did not derive their just\r\npowers from the consent of the governed.\r\n\r\nJohn T. Morgan of Alabama entered into a long and sarcastic argument\r\nto prove that if a woman could vote in Wyoming she might be sent to\r\nCongress and then she could not be admitted because the law says a\r\nsenator or representative \"must be an inhabitant of the State in which\r\n_he_ is chosen.\" He ignored the fact that all legal papers are made\r\nout with this pronoun, which presents no difficulty in their\r\napplication to women.\r\n\r\nHenry B. Payne of Ohio said that he was not in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage, and that no woman in England ever had been permitted to\r\nexercise the elective franchise. (Women then had been voting in\r\nEngland for twenty-one years, the same length of time as in Wyoming.)\r\nHe asked, however, if these little technical objections would not be\r\nmore than overcome by the moral influence that a woman Representative\r\nmight exert in the committee rooms and on the floor of the House.\r\n\r\nMr. Morgan at once launched forth into a panegyric on the moral\r\ninfluence of woman which certainly demonstrated that if sentimentalism\r\nwere a bar to voting, as Senators Vest and Reagan had insisted it\r\nshould be, the senator from Alabama would have to be disfranchised.\r\nPart of it ran as follows:\r\n\r\n     It is not the moral influence of woman upon the ballot that I am\r\n     objecting to, and it is not to get rid of that or to silence or\r\n     destroy such influence that I oppose it, but it is the immoral\r\n     influence of the ballot upon woman that I deprecate and would\r\n     avoid. I do not want to see her drawn into contact with the rude\r\n     things of this world, where the delicacy of her senses and\r\n     sensibilities would be constantly wounded by the attrition with\r\n     bad and desperate and foul politicians and men. Such is not her\r\n     function and is not her office; and if we degrade her from the\r\n     high station that God has placed her in to put her at the\r\n     ballot-box, at political or other elections, we unman ourselves\r\n     and refuse to do the duties that God has assigned to us.\r\n\r\n     I can say for myself and for those who are dearest to me of all\r\n     the objects in this life, that I would leave a country where it\r\n     was necessary that my wife and daughters should go to the polls\r\n     to protect my liberties. I would just as soon see them shoulder\r\n     their guns and go like Amazons into the field and fight beneath\r\n     the flag for my liberties, as to see them muster on election day\r\n     for any such purpose.[478]\r\n\r\nJames K. Jones of Arkansas based his argument on the estimate of an\r\nequal number of men and women in Wyoming, and assumed that all the\r\nwomen had voted in favor of the suffrage clause and that therefore it\r\ndid not represent the wishes of men, thus denying wholly the right of\r\nwomen to a voice in a matter which so vitally concerned themselves. In\r\nreality women formed considerably less than one-third of the adult\r\npopulation, while the constitution was adopted by more than a\r\nthree-fourths vote.\r\n\r\nWilliam M. Stewart of Nevada and Algernon S. Paddock of Nebraska\r\ndefended the right of the Territory to decide this question for\r\nitself.\r\n\r\nGeorge Gray of Delaware declared his belief that \"woman suffrage is\r\ninimical to the best interests of society.\" John C. Spooner of\r\nWisconsin disapproved the enfranchisement of women, but believed\r\nWyoming had a right to place it in its constitution.\r\n\r\nOrville H. Platt of Connecticut in urging the acceptance of the report\r\nsaid:\r\n\r\n     I never have been an advocate of woman suffrage. I never\r\n     believed, as some senators do, that it was wise. But with all\r\n     that, I would not keep a Territory out of the Union as a State\r\n     because its constitution did allow women to vote, nor would I\r\n     force upon a Territory any restriction or qualification as to\r\n     what its vote should be in that respect. When Washington\r\n     Territory came here and asked for admission and the bill was\r\n     passed, it had had woman suffrage, and I was appealed to by a\r\n     great many citizens all over the United States to keep it out of\r\n     the Union, so far as my action could do so, until it restored the\r\n     right of women to vote which had been taken away under a decision\r\n     of its own courts--taken away, as I thought, unjustly; for I did\r\n     not consider that decision good law. The senator from\r\n     Massachusetts, Mr. Hoar, interrogated me when I was advocating\r\n     the admission of Washington as to why we did not incorporate into\r\n     that enabling act some language that should undo the wrong which\r\n     had been done by the Supreme Court of the Territory and restore\r\n     to women the right of voting. I said then, as I say now, that I\r\n     think this is a matter which belongs to the Territory; and I am\r\n     surprised that gentlemen who are so devoted to home rule as a\r\n     sacred right which should never be interfered with in this\r\n     republic, should not be willing to allow to a Territory, when it\r\n     asks for admission, the right to determine whether women should\r\n     or should not be permitted to vote by the constitution of the\r\n     proposed State.... Why should we, the Congress of the United\r\n     States, stand here and say to that Territory, where women have\r\n     enjoyed the right of voting for twenty years, and nobody arises\r\n     to gainsay it or to intimate that they have not exercised the\r\n     right wisely, why should we stand here and say: \"Keep out of the\r\n     Union; we will let no community, no Territory, in here which does\r\n     not deprive its women of the right they have enjoyed while in a\r\n     Territorial condition\"?\r\n\r\nAfter every possible device to strike out the obnoxious clause had\r\nbeen exhausted, the bill to admit Wyoming as a State was passed on\r\nJune 27, 1890, by 29 ayes, 18 noes, 37 absent.[479] Although Henry W.\r\nBlair of New Hampshire and Henry M. Teller of Colorado interposed\r\nremarks showing a thorough belief in the enfranchisement of women,\r\nthere was no formal argument in its behalf, it being generally\r\nunderstood that all Republicans would vote for the bill in order to\r\nadmit a Republican State, and a number did so who were not in favor of\r\nwoman suffrage.\r\n\r\nWhen the people of Wyoming met at Cheyenne, July 23, to celebrate\r\ntheir Statehood, by Gov. Francis E. Warren sat Mrs. Amalia Post,\r\npresident of the Woman Suffrage Association. The first and principal\r\noration of the day was made by Mrs. Theresa A. Jenkins, of which the\r\nHistory of Wyoming says:\r\n\r\n     Proceeding to the front of the platform, Mrs. Jenkins, in clear,\r\n     forceful tones which penetrated to the very outskirts of the\r\n     crowd, delivered without manuscript or notes an address which in\r\n     logic and eloquence has rarely if ever been equaled by any woman\r\n     in the land.... At its conclusion she received an ovation and was\r\n     presented with a magnificent basket of flowers.\r\n\r\n     The great incident of the celebration, the presenting of the\r\n     flag, next followed. Mrs. Esther Morris, the \"mother\" of the\r\n     woman suffrage movement in this State, who is widely respected\r\n     for her great ability and heroic womanhood, was by general\r\n     consent accorded the post of honor and made the presentation to\r\n     Governor Warren. Gathering its folds about her she said:\r\n\r\n     \"On behalf of the women of Wyoming, and in grateful recognition\r\n     of the high privilege of citizenship which has been conferred\r\n     upon us, I have the honor to present to the State of Wyoming this\r\n     beautiful banner. May it always remain the emblem of our\r\n     liberties, 'and the flag of the Union forever.'\"\r\n\r\n     The Governor, on receiving it from Mrs. Morris, made an eloquent\r\n     response during which he paid this tribute to women:\r\n\r\n     \"Wyoming in her progress has not forgotten the hands and hearts\r\n     that have helped advance her to this high position; and, in the\r\n     adoption of her constitution, equal suffrage is entrenched so\r\n     firmly that it is believed it will stand forever.... Women of\r\n     Wyoming, you have builded well, and the men of Wyoming extend\r\n     heartiest greeting at this time. They congratulate you upon your\r\n     achievements, and ask you to join them in the future, as in the\r\n     past, in securing good government for our commonwealth.\"\r\n\r\nThe poet of the day was a woman, Mrs. I. S. Bartlett, who gave The\r\nTrue Republic. In every possible way the men showed their honor and\r\nappreciation of the women, and from this noble attitude they never\r\nhave departed.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1895, Miss Susan B. Anthony, president of the National\r\nAssociation, carried out a long-cherished desire to visit Wyoming. She\r\nwas on the way to take part in the Woman's Congress of San Francisco,\r\naccompanied by the Rev. Anna Howard Shaw, vice-president-at-large, and\r\nthey stopped at Cheyenne where they were the guests of Senator and\r\nMrs. Carey, who gave a dinner party in their honor, attended by\r\nGovernor and Mrs. Richards, Senator and Mrs. Warren, Mrs. Morris, Mrs.\r\nJenkins, Mrs. Post and other distinguished guests. They went\r\nimmediately from dinner to the new Baptist church, which was filled to\r\noverflowing, and were introduced by the Governor. At the close of the\r\nlecture Mrs. Jenkins said, \"Now I desire to introduce the audience to\r\nthe speakers.\" She then called the names of the Governor and all his\r\nstaff, the attorney-general, the United States judges, the senators\r\nand congressmen, the mayor and members of the city council. Each arose\r\nas his name was mentioned, and before she was through it seemed as if\r\nhalf the audience were on their feet, and the applause was most\r\nenthusiastic.\r\n\r\nMiss Anthony often spoke of this as one of the proudest moments of her\r\nlife--when it was not necessary to beg the men in her audience to do\r\njustice to women, but when these men, the most eminent in the State,\r\nrose in a body to pay their respects to the women whom they had\r\nenfranchised without appeal, and to those other women who were\r\ndevoting their lives to secure political freedom for all of their sex.\r\n\r\nDuring the more than thirty years which have elapsed since the\r\nsuffrage was given to women, not one reputable person in the State\r\never has produced any evidence or even said over his or her own\r\nsignature that woman suffrage is other than an unimpeachable success\r\nin Wyoming.\r\n\r\nEvery Governor of the Territory for twenty years bore witness to its\r\ngood results. Governors of Territories are appointed by the President,\r\nnot elected by the people, and as they were not dependent on women's\r\nvotes, their testimony was impartial.\r\n\r\nYear after year the State officials, the Judges of the Supreme Court,\r\nministers, editors and other prominent citizens have testified in the\r\nstrongest possible manner to the beneficial results of woman\r\nsuffrage.[480]\r\n\r\nGov. Francis E. Warren said in 1885: \"I have seen much of the workings\r\nof woman suffrage. I have yet to hear of the first case of domestic\r\ndiscord growing therefrom. Our women nearly all vote.\" He also\r\nreported to the Secretary of the Interior: \"The men are as favorable\r\nto woman suffrage as the women are. Wyoming appreciates, believes in\r\nand indorses woman suffrage.\" In his official report the next year he\r\nstated: \"Woman suffrage continues as popular as at first. The women\r\nnearly all vote and neither party objects.\" And in 1889: \"No one will\r\ndeny that woman's influence in voting always has been on the side of\r\ngood government. The people favor its continuance.\" In the same year,\r\nwhile still Governor, he wrote:\r\n\r\n     After twenty years' trial of woman suffrage in Wyoming Territory,\r\n     it is pronounced an unqualified success by men and women alike,\r\n     and of both political parties.... I sincerely hope that all the\r\n     new States will so provide that it may prevail immediately, or\r\n     that it can be extended at any time hereafter when their\r\n     Legislatures desire, if they are not now ready to take the step.\r\n\r\n     The women of Wyoming have been exceedingly discreet and wise in\r\n     their suffrage, so much so that the different Legislatures have\r\n     not attempted its overthrow, although majorities have sometimes\r\n     been largely Republican and at other times largely Democratic.\r\n\r\nDuring all his years as United States senator Mr. Warren never has\r\nfailed to give his testimony and influence in favor of the\r\nenfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\nIn 1889 Delegate Joseph M. Carey wrote from the House of\r\nRepresentatives at Washington: \"Wyoming Territory has for twenty years\r\nhad full woman suffrage. It has commended itself to the approval of\r\nour people of all parties ... I sincerely hope the new States will\r\nadopt suffrage principles without regard to sex, or provide by a\r\nclause in their respective constitutions that the Legislatures may by\r\nstatute confer the right of franchise upon women.\" Throughout his\r\nsubsequent term in the United States Senate he was consistent in this\r\nattitude and has remained so ever since.\r\n\r\nFollowing the example of every Territorial Governor, Amos W. Barber,\r\nthe first State Governor, declared:\r\n\r\n     Woman suffrage does not degrade woman. On the contrary, it\r\n     ennobles her and brings out all the strong attributes of true\r\n     womanhood. To their credit be it said, the women are almost a\r\n     unit for ability, honesty and integrity wherever found, in high\r\n     life or low life. A man must walk straight in Wyoming, for the\r\n     women hold the balance of power and they are using it wisely and\r\n     judiciously. The cause of education is their first aim. They are\r\n     making our schools the model of the country, and, too, they can\r\n     make a dollar go much further than their husbands can.\r\n\r\nIn 1900 a petition was circulated in the State, asking Congress to\r\nsubmit a Sixteenth Amendment to the Federal Constitution, prohibiting\r\nthe disfranchisement of United States citizens on account of sex. It\r\nwas signed by the Governor, the Secretary of State, the Auditor of\r\nState, the State Superintendent of Instruction, the State engineer,\r\nthe Judges of the Supreme Court, the United States district attorney,\r\nthe United States surveyor general, the director and the observer of\r\nthe United States Weather Bureau, the mayor of Cheyenne and a long\r\nlist of editors, ministers, lawyers, physicians, bankers and the most\r\nprominent women in the State. Mrs. Carey, who had the petition in\r\ncharge, wrote to Miss Anthony: \"Thousands of names could be secured if\r\nit were necessary.\"\r\n\r\nLiterally speaking the testimony from Wyoming in favor of woman\r\nsuffrage is limited only by the space for this chapter.[481]\r\n\r\nIn 1901 this joint resolution was passed:\r\n\r\n     WHEREAS, Wyoming was the first State to adopt woman suffrage,\r\n     which has been in operation since 1869 and was adopted in the\r\n     constitution of the State in 1890; during which time women have\r\n     exercised the privilege as generally as men, with the result that\r\n     better candidates have been elected for office, methods of\r\n     election purified, the character of legislation improved, civic\r\n     intelligence increased and womanhood developed to greater\r\n     usefulness by political responsibility; therefore,\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, By the House of Representatives, the Senate\r\n     concurring, That, in view of these results, the enfranchisement\r\n     of women in every State and Territory of the American Union is\r\n     hereby recommended as a measure tending to the advancement of a\r\n     higher and better social order;\r\n\r\n     _Resolved_, That an authenticated copy of these resolutions be\r\n     forwarded by the Governor of the State to the Legislature of\r\n     every State and Territory, and that the press be requested to\r\n     call public attention to these resolutions.\r\n\r\n                     EDWARD W. STONE, _President of the Senate_.\r\n                     J. S. ATHERLEY, _Speaker of the House_.\r\n     Approved Feb. 13, 1901.\r\n\r\n                                   DEFOREST RICHARDS, _Governor_.\r\n\r\nFor a number of years women served on grand and petit juries. In\r\ncompiling the first volume of the Laws of Wyoming, Secretary and\r\nActing Governor Edward M. Lee said:\r\n\r\n     In the provisions of the woman suffrage clause, enacted in 1869,\r\n     we placed this youngest Territory on earth in the van of\r\n     civilization and progress. That this statement has been verified\r\n     by practical experience the testimony is unanimous, continuous\r\n     and conclusive. Not a link is wanting in the chain of evidence\r\n     and, as a Governor of the Territory once said: \"The only\r\n     dissenting voices against woman suffrage have been those of\r\n     convicts who have been tried and found guilty by women jurors.\"\r\n     Women exercised the right of jurors and contributed to the speedy\r\n     release of the Territory from the régime of the pistol and\r\n     bowie-knife. They not only performed their new duties without\r\n     losing any of the womanly virtues, and with dignity and decorum,\r\n     but good results were immediately seen. Chief Justice J. H. Howe,\r\n     of the Supreme Court, under whose direction women were first\r\n     drawn on juries, wrote in 1872: \"After the grand jury had been in\r\n     session two days the dance-house keepers, gamblers and\r\n     _demi-monde_ fled out of the State in dismay to escape the\r\n     indictment of women jurors. In short, I have never, in\r\n     twenty-five years' experience in the courts of the country, seen\r\n     a more faithful and resolutely honest grand and petit jury than\r\n     these.\"\r\n\r\nThe best women in the Territory served as jurors, and they were\r\ntreated with the most profound respect and highly complimented for\r\ntheir efficiency. The successor of Chief Justice Howe was opposed to\r\ntheir serving and none were summoned by him. Jury duty is not\r\nacceptable to men, as a rule, and the women themselves were not\r\nanxious for it, so the custom gradually fell into disuse. The juries\r\nare made up from the tax lists, which contain only a small proportion\r\nof women. There are no court decisions against women as jurors, and\r\nthey are still summoned occasionally in special cases.\r\n\r\nWomen have not taken a conspicuous part in politics. The population is\r\nscattered, there are no large cities and necessarily no great\r\nassociations of women for organized work. They are conscientious in\r\nvoting for men who, in their opinion, have the best interests of the\r\ncommunity at heart. More latitude must necessarily be permitted in new\r\nStates, but in 1900 they decided that it was time to call a halt on\r\nthe evil of gambling, and as the result of their efforts a law was\r\npassed by the present Legislature (1901) forbidding it. The Chicago\r\n_Tribune_ gave a correct summing-up of this matter in the following\r\neditorial:\r\n\r\n     The women of Wyoming are to be credited with securing one reform\r\n     which is a sufficient answer, in that State at least, to the\r\n     criticism that woman suffrage has no influence upon legislation\r\n     and fails to elevate political action. There will be no legalized\r\n     gambling in Wyoming after the first of January next, the\r\n     Legislature having just passed a law which makes gambling of\r\n     every kind punishable by fine and imprisonment after the above\r\n     date.\r\n\r\n     This has been the work of the women. When they began their\r\n     agitation about a year and a half ago, gambling was not only\r\n     permitted but was licensed. The evil was so strongly entrenched\r\n     and the revenue accruing to the State so large that there was\r\n     little hope at first that anything would be accomplished. The\r\n     leaders of the crusade, however, organized their forces skilfully\r\n     in every town and village. Their petitions for the repeal of the\r\n     gambling statute and for the passage of a prohibitory act were\r\n     circulated everywhere, and were signed by thousands of male as\r\n     well as female voters. When the Legislature met, the women were\r\n     there in force, armed with their voluminous petitions. The\r\n     gamblers also were there in force and sought to defeat the women\r\n     by the use of large sums of money, but womanly tact and\r\n     persuasion and direct personal appeals carried the day against\r\n     strong opposition. The Legislature passed the bill, but it was\r\n     the women who won the victory.\r\n\r\nThe most prejudiced must admit that women could not have done this if\r\nthey had not represented at least as many votes as the gambling\r\nfraternity.\r\n\r\nLAWS: The first Legislature (1869), which conferred the suffrage upon\r\nwomen, gave wives exactly the same rights as husbands in their\r\nseparate property.\r\n\r\nDower and curtesy have been abolished. If either husband or wife die\r\nwithout a will, leaving descendants, one-half of the estate, both real\r\nand personal, goes to the survivor. If there are no descendants,\r\nthree-fourths go to the survivor, one-fourth to the father and mother\r\nor their survivors, unless the estate, both real and personal, does\r\nnot exceed $10,000, in which case it all passes to the widow or\r\nwidower. A homestead to the value of $1,500 is exempted for the\r\nsurvivor and minor children.\r\n\r\nA married woman may sue and be sued, make contracts and carry on\r\nbusiness in her own name.\r\n\r\nThe father is the guardian of the minor children, and at his death the\r\nmother. There is no law requiring a husband to support his\r\nfamily.[482]\r\n\r\nThe \"age of protection\" for girls was raised from 10 to 14 years in\r\n1882, and from 14 to 18 in 1890. The penalty varies from imprisonment\r\nfor one year to life. Seduction under promise of marriage up to the\r\nage of 21 years is a penitentiary offense. Male and female habitues of\r\na house of ill-repute are considered guilty of the same offense, but\r\nthe man is liable for a fine of $100 and imprisonment for sixty days,\r\nwhile the woman is liable for only half this punishment.\r\n\r\nSUFFRAGE: Women have had the Full Franchise since 1869.\r\n\r\nNo separate record is kept of their votes, as they have exercised the\r\nsuffrage so long that this would seem no more necessary than to keep\r\none of the men's votes. The census of 1900 gives the percentage of men\r\nin the State as 63 (in round numbers) and of women as 37. The estimate\r\nof those who are best informed is that 90 per cent. of the women who\r\nare eligible use the suffrage.\r\n\r\nOFFICE HOLDING: Since the organization of the Territory in 1869 women\r\nhave been eligible to all official positions, but there never has been\r\nany scramble for office.\r\n\r\nNo woman ever has served in the Legislature.\r\n\r\nMiss Estelle Reel was State Superintendent of Public Instruction for\r\nfour years. She is now National Superintendent of Indian Schools,\r\nappointed by President William McKinley, and has 300 of these under\r\nher charge.\r\n\r\nMiss Grace Raymond Hebard is librarian of the State University, and\r\nfor the past ten years has filled the position of secretary of the\r\nboard of trustees, upon which women serve.\r\n\r\nMiss Bertha Mills is clerk of the State Land Board, with a salary\r\nequal to that of any clerk or deputy in the State House.\r\n\r\nMiss Rose Foote was assistant clerk in the House of Representatives of\r\nthe last Legislature, and as a reader she left nothing to be desired.\r\nWomen frequently serve as legislative enrolling clerks. There have\r\nbeen women clerks of the courts.\r\n\r\nWomen hold several important clerkships in the State Capitol and are\r\nfound as stenographers, etc., in all the State, county and municipal\r\noffices.\r\n\r\nIn many districts they serve on the school board, and nearly all of\r\nthe counties elect them to the responsible position of superintendent.\r\nAs such they conduct the institutes, examine teachers and have a\r\ngeneral supervision of the schools.\r\n\r\nOCCUPATIONS: The only industry legally forbidden to women is that of\r\nworking in mines.\r\n\r\nEDUCATION: All educational advantages are the same for both sexes.\r\n\r\nBy a law of 1869 Wyoming requires equal pay for men and women in all\r\nemployment pertaining to the State. This includes the public schools,\r\nin which there are 102 men and 434 women teachers. But here as\r\nelsewhere the men hold the higher positions and their average monthly\r\nsalary is $60.40, while that of the women is $42.86.\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[471] The History is indebted to the Hon.

During the '70's there had been a debate and division on\r\nthe Women's Suffrage Bill in the House of Commons nearly every year.\r\nAfter the General Election of 1880 the question of Household Suffrage\r\nin the Counties came to the front, and all the efforts of the Women's\r\nSuffrage Societies were directed and inspired by the anticipation that\r\nwhen the claims of the agricultural labourer were dealt with, those of\r\nwomen would find their opportunity. But far from this, they were left\r\npractically in a worse position than before, for now 2,000,000 new\r\nvoters were added to the number of those who could make prior claim to\r\nthe attention of their representatives.\r\n\r\n_1885._--Immediately after the General Election which followed the\r\npassing of the new Reform Bill, Mr. Gladstone gave notice of his Bill\r\nfor Home Rule for Ireland and the party feeling aroused was of such\r\nintensity that the Liberal party was cloven in twain. The Women's\r\nSuffrage movement was affected by the keen party strife, in which\r\nwomen were as deeply interested as men, and the question of their\r\nenfranchisement was no longer the only rallying point for their\r\npolitical activity. This period is marked by a rapid development of\r\norganisations amongst women for party purposes. In the Primrose\r\nLeague, which had been started in 1883, women had been assigned\r\nunprecedented recognition as co-operating with men on equal footing\r\nfor political purposes. It does not promote special measures but lays\r\ndown for its principle the Maintenance of Religion, of the Estates of\r\nthe Realm and of the Imperial Ascendancy of the British Empire, thus\r\nindicating its Conservative tendency. The Women's Liberal Federation,\r\nfounded in 1885 to promote liberal principles, endeavours to further\r\nspecial measures. The Women's Liberal Unionist Association founded in\r\n1888 had for its principal object the defence of the legislative union\r\nbetween England and Ireland.\r\n\r\nThus women entered actively into the work of the three respective\r\nparties, and this re-acted in various ways on the Women's Suffrage\r\npropaganda. It might seem that this had a depressing effect, for the\r\nrigid neutrality in regard to party which always had characterised the\r\nNational Societies for Women's Suffrage might easily seem dull and\r\ntame to the ardent party enthusiasts, and many of the Liberal women\r\nthrew their energies by preference into the Women's Liberal\r\nAssociations, but the old charge that women had no interest in\r\npolitics, now received its complete quietus. It seems indeed a far cry\r\nfrom the manners of sixty years ago, when to talk politics to a woman\r\nwas considered rude, to the manners of to-day when the Primrose League\r\nbalances its 75,000 Knights with 63,000 Dames, besides associates\r\ninnumerable, both men and women; and the Women's Liberal Federation\r\nwith its 448 Associations has actively worked for candidates in a\r\ngreat number of counties in England.\r\n\r\n_1886._--The number of members returned after the General Election of\r\n1885 who were understood to be favorably inclined towards the\r\nenfranchisement of women, exceeded any previous experience and on\r\nFebruary 18th the motion to adjourn discussion was rejected by 159\r\nayes, 102 noes, and the bill passed second reading without further\r\ndivision; but before going into Committee another dissolution of\r\nParliament took place.\r\n\r\nThe General Election which followed was even more favorable, the\r\nfriendly Members returned being in an actual majority, and yet session\r\nafter session passed and the pressure of Government business consumed\r\nParliamentary time.\r\n\r\n_1887-1890._--The need of a central point, such as is afforded when\r\nthere is a bill before the House, round which all the suffrage forces\r\ncould rally independent of party, made it difficult for them to\r\nmaintain their cohesion. The Central Committee of the National Society\r\nfor Women's Suffrage had been such a point but it could not escape the\r\ndistracting outside influences, and a revision of its rules took place\r\nin December, 1888, with the result that the Society as hitherto\r\nexisting dissolved and reformed in two separate organisations. One of\r\nthese established new rules which enabled it to affiliate with\r\nSocieties formed for other purposes; and one adhered to the old rules\r\nwhich admitted only organisations formed with the sole object of\r\nobtaining the Franchise. But if, as was held, the internal\r\nre-organisation of the Societies redounded to greater strength, even\r\nmore so did an unprecedented attack from the outside, in the Summer of\r\n1889, when the _Nineteenth Century_ opened its pages to a protest\r\nagainst the enfranchisement of women, to which a few ladies in London\r\nsociety had been diligently canvassing for signatures. The appearance\r\nof this protest was naturally the sign for an immediate counterblast,\r\nand the two Central Societies in London put a form of declaration into\r\nimmediate circulation. The _Fortnightly Review_ gave space to a reply\r\nfrom the pen of Mrs. Millicent Garrett Fawcett and to a selection from\r\nthe signatures which poured into the Suffrage Offices with a rapidity\r\nthat was amazing, as in sending out the forms for signature numbers\r\nhad not been aimed at but rather it was sought to make the list\r\nrepresentative. The _Nineteenth Century_ had contained the names of\r\n104 ladies, mostly known as wives of public men, while those who had\r\ntaken part in work for the good of the community and to advance the\r\ninterests of women were conspicuous by their absence. The\r\n_Fortnightly_ gave space for about 600 names asking for the suffrage,\r\nselected from over 2,000 received within a few days.[484]\r\n\r\nThis was the last work in which the distinguished reformer, Miss\r\nCaroline Ashurst Biggs, took part, as she died in September, 1889.\r\nMiss Lydia Becker, editor of _The Women's Suffrage Journal_, which she\r\nhad founded in 1870, passed away the following Summer. These two\r\ndeaths were an irreparable loss to the movement for the\r\nenfranchisement of women.\r\n\r\n_1891._--Parliamentary prospects grew brighter and Mr. William\r\nWoodall, who had charge of the Suffrage Bill, obtained May 13th for\r\nits consideration. The first Lord of the Treasury, Mr. W. H. Smith,\r\nhad received a deputation appointed by the Suffrage Societies April\r\n20th, to present him with a largely signed memorial praying that Her\r\nMajesty's Government would reserve the day appointed for the\r\ndiscussion of a measure \"which suffers under the special disadvantage\r\nthat those whom it chiefly concerns have no voting power with which to\r\nfortify their claims.\" They received the assurance that the House\r\nwould not adjourn before the 13th, and that the Government had no\r\nintention of taking the day for their business.\r\n\r\nOn April 30th, however, when the Government proposed to take certain\r\nspecified days for their business, Mr. Gladstone objected, insisting\r\nthat they should be uniform in their action and take all Wednesdays up\r\nto Whitsuntide. This afforded a manifest opportunity for shelving the\r\nSuffrage Bill which the opponents were quick to perceive and,\r\nalthough Mr. Smith declared himself unable to take this day, Sir Henry\r\nJames moved that all Wednesdays be taken. This was carried and the\r\nGovernment, for probably the first time in Parliamentary History, had\r\na day forced on them.\r\n\r\n_1892._--Better fortunes attended the endeavours of the Parliamentary\r\nleaders in the following session. Mr. Woodall having accepted office\r\nin the Government, Sir Algernon Borthwick (now Lord Glenesk) undertook\r\nthe necessary arrangements for the introduction of the Bill. This was\r\nplaced, by the result of the ballot for a day, in the hands of Sir\r\nAlbert Rollit, who set it down for April 27th in the following terms:\r\n\r\n     Every woman who (1) in Great Britain is registered as an elector\r\n     for any Town Council or County Council, or (2) in Ireland is a\r\n     rate-payer entitled to vote at an election for guardians of the\r\n     poor, shall be entitled to be registered as a Parliamentary\r\n     elector and, when registered, to vote at any Parliamentary\r\n     election for the County borough or division wherein the\r\n     qualifying property is situate.\r\n\r\nThis Bill was brought forward for second reading on the appointed day\r\nby Sir Albert Rollit with a powerful statement of the question, and a\r\ndebate followed marked by a high and serious tone. For this brief\r\nnarrative it will suffice to note the closing speech from the Right\r\nHon. A. J. Balfour, who concluded by saying that whenever any\r\nimportant extension of the Franchise was brought up \"they would have\r\nto face and deal with the problem of Women's Suffrage--and deal with\r\nit in a complete fashion.\" The division showed 175 for the Bill, 192\r\nagainst--a result which was a surprise to both sides, for the\r\nopponents had exerted themselves in a manner beyond all precedent;\r\nthey had sent round a whip signed by twenty members, ten on each side\r\nof the House, and Mr. Gladstone had written a letter to Mr. Samuel\r\nSmith, that had been circulated as a pamphlet, in which amongst other\r\npoints he urged that at least it should be ascertained \"that the\r\nwomanly mind of the country was in overwhelming proportion and with\r\ndeliberate purpose bent on procuring the vote.\"\r\n\r\n_1893-1895._--At the opening of the Parliament it was a great\r\nsatisfaction to the Women's Suffrage party that Viscount Wolmer (now\r\nthe Earl of Selborne) had undertaken the Parliamentary leadership of\r\nthe question. It will hardly be needful here to go into all the causes\r\nwhich thwarted the vigilance of the leader in procuring a hearing for\r\nthe measure in that Parliament.\r\n\r\nOn June 1st, 1895, a representative Conference was held at Westminster\r\nTown Hall to consider a plan for an appeal to the House of Commons\r\nfrom women all over the United Kingdom. Miss Florence Davenport Hill,\r\nwho presided, briefly explained that the object of such an appeal was\r\nto convince the country in a more emphatic manner than could be\r\npossible by the petitions, memorials and demonstrations that already\r\nhad been tried again and again, all of which were necessarily limited\r\nin their scope. This appeal should be from women of all ranks and\r\nclasses in all parts of the United Kingdom. The Appeal for the\r\nParliamentary Franchise then agreed upon was managed by a committee\r\nappointed from the chief organisations amongst women.\r\n\r\n_1896._--This effort to \"focus the diffused interest of women in the\r\nsuffrage into one concentrated expression\" resulted in the collection\r\nof 257,796 signatures, nearly every constituency in the United Kingdom\r\nbeing represented. Although the Appeal was in readiness for\r\npresentation in the session of 1895, a suitable opportunity did not\r\narise until 1896, when a fairly good place had been drawn in the\r\nballot by Mr. Faithfull Begg and the Bill was set down for May 20th.\r\nPermission was obtained to place the Appeal in Westminster Hall on May\r\n19th, and passes were given to the Committee to enable them to show it\r\nto any Members of Parliament who might wish to inspect it.\r\nAccordingly--although it was already known that all Wednesdays had\r\nbeen taken in Government business--the Appeal of the women of this day\r\nand generation for constitutional rights was placed in that grand old\r\nHall, round which the Parliamentary associations of a thousand years\r\nare clustered. Many Members showed great interest in studying the\r\nsignatures from their respective constituencies.\r\n\r\nIrrespective of the interest called forth, other good results\r\nfollowed, for the Women's Suffrage Societies had been drawn into\r\npleasant relation with a great many new friends and helpers all over\r\nthe country. It was also shown that women who differed widely on\r\npolitical and social questions could work cordially and unanimously\r\nfor this common object. The closer union which this work had brought\r\nabout led to the modification of the Special Appeal Committee into a\r\ncombined Committee for Parliamentary Work. A Conference held in the\r\nPriory Rooms, Birmingham, October 16th, attended by delegates from all\r\nthe Women's Suffrage Societies, greatly assisted concerted action.\r\n\r\n_1897._--All was thus in good working order when at the opening of the\r\nsession an excellent place was drawn in the ballot by Mr. Faithfull\r\nBegg (M. P. for St. Rollox division of Glasgow) and the Women's\r\nFranchise Bill was set down for February 3rd, when it passed second\r\nreading by a majority of 71. The old opponents sent out a strong whip\r\nagainst the Bill and mustered in force, but they were exceeded by the\r\nold friends, nor did the division show the whole strength of the\r\nmovement, as many known to be favorable were still absent at that\r\nearly date of the session.[485] A statement issued by the National\r\nUnion of Women's Suffrage Societies, said:\r\n\r\n     This vote places the question of Women's Suffrage in a new phase,\r\n     and its friends have only to continue to press it upon the\r\n     attention of Parliament and the public in order to render it\r\n     necessary at no distant date that it should be dealt with by the\r\n     Government of the day. This has been the history of nearly all\r\n     important measures of reform. They have very rarely been placed\r\n     on the Statute Book by private members; but private members by\r\n     repeatedly bringing a particular question before the House give\r\n     the opportunity for its full consideration by Parliament and the\r\n     country, so that in due time it takes its place as a Government\r\n     measure. It will be the aim of the Union to put Women's Suffrage\r\n     in this position, so that no Government, of whatever party, shall\r\n     be able to touch questions relating to representation without at\r\n     the same time removing the electoral disabilities of women.\r\n\r\nThe closer coalition that Autumn of all the Societies which make\r\nWomen's Suffrage their sole object into a National Union was in itself\r\na symptom of that new phase, and the combined Sub-Committee was now\r\nfurther modified into the Executive Committee of the National Union of\r\nWomen's Suffrage Societies.\r\n\r\n_1898-1899._--The value of this second reading has been permanent\r\nnotwithstanding that its progress through the next stage of going into\r\nCommittee was thwarted by what even the _Times_ described as an\r\n\"undignified shuffle.\" The rule that Bills which have reached\r\nCommittee stage before Whitsuntide should be taken on Wednesdays after\r\nWhitsuntide in their turn, so that if any one Bill is not finished on\r\nthe day it is taken it is carried to the next, was so worked as to\r\nshut out the Women's Franchise Bill in 1899, and the rule which was\r\nmeant to give equitable share to all was abused by purposely\r\nprotracted talk over Bills which had no claim to such profuse\r\nattention.\r\n\r\nThis was the last opportunity that the pressure of the eventful years\r\nwith which the century closed afforded for Parliamentary debate. The\r\ngreat meeting in Queen's Hall, London, June 29th, 1899, when the\r\nNational Union of Women's Suffrage Societies gave hearty welcome to\r\ntheir fellow-workers from all parts of the globe during the\r\nInternational Council of Women, remains the latest event of public\r\nsignificance.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe new House of Commons, 1901, includes 267 members who have voted in\r\nformer Parliaments on the question of extending the Parliamentary\r\nFranchise to Women; of these 96 are opponents, 171 are supporters. One\r\nhas continued to be a consistent opponent from the division on Mr.\r\nJohn Stuart Mill's amendment to the Reform Bill of 1867. Two have\r\ncontinued to be consistent supporters from the same division. Of\r\nmembers whose first time of voting dates from one or other of the\r\nnumerous divisions which took place between the Reform Acts of 1867\r\nand 1884, there still remain 20 opponents and 25 supporters. Of the\r\nmembers who recorded their vote for the first time on the question in\r\nthe division on Sir Albert Rollit's Bill of 1892, there remain 24\r\nopponents and 30 supporters. Of those whose first votes date from the\r\ndivision on Mr. Faithfull Begg's Bill in 1897, there remain 51\r\nopponents and 114 supporters.\r\n\r\nThus the ratio of supporters gradually strengthens, and this\r\nnotwithstanding the retirement of twice as many tried friends as of\r\nsteady opponents. If to these considerations it is added that amongst\r\nthe newly-elected members, for each one who is understood to be an\r\nopponent there are at least three understood to be friendly, it will\r\nbe seen that the march of time strengthens the ranks of the Women's\r\nSuffrage cause in the House of Commons.\r\n\r\nAmongst the supporters who have retired from Parliamentary life are\r\nthree past leaders of the Women's Suffrage Bill, Mr. Leonard Courtney,\r\nMr. Woodall and Mr. Faithfull Begg. Two past leaders now have seats in\r\nthe Cabinet, Lord Selborne and Mr. George Wyndham. The Premier, Lord\r\nSalisbury, has been at all times a true friend; the leader of the\r\nHouse of Commons, the Right Hon. A. J. Balfour, has voted and spoken\r\nin favor of the question in that body.\r\n\r\nMention has been made of the death of Miss Becker and of Miss Biggs.\r\nMiss Isabella M. S. Tod of Belfast, who passed away on December 8th,\r\n1896, was a bright and leading spirit, in Ireland especially. In\r\nNovember, 1899, the Edinburgh Committee lost their much-loved Hon.\r\nSecretary, Miss Eliza Wigham, who had held that office for more than\r\nthirty years. In the same month Mr. Jacob Bright, who secured the\r\nMunicipal Franchise for women, also passed away.\r\n\r\nIn Ireland the Local Government Act of 1898 gave fresh impetus to\r\nwomen's public work, and Mrs. Haslam, the veteran Hon. Secretary of\r\nthe Dublin Women's Suffrage Society, for the past twenty-six years,\r\nstill encourages the rising workers of today.\r\n\r\nThe North of England Women's Suffrage Society has just sent a petition\r\nwith over 29,000 signatures entirely from women working in Lancashire\r\ncotton factories. The petition, which looked like a garden roller from\r\nits size, was brought up by a deputation of fifteen of the women, and\r\nby them placed in the hands of their Parliamentary friends for\r\npresentation.\r\n\r\nIn London the branches have amalgamated into one Central\r\nSociety--President, Lady Frances Balfour; Chairman, Mrs. Millicent\r\nGarrett Fawcett--and life and effort are apparent in every\r\ndirection.[486]\r\n\r\nThe new century has opened with a heavy shadow of sorrow for the\r\nBritish people in the death of their much-loved sovereign, Queen\r\nVictoria. Her reign will always be conspicuous as an era of change of\r\ntone in regard to the studies and pursuits of women. The extent to\r\nwhich that change is due to the presence on the throne of a woman full\r\nof goodness--one for whom Truth was her guide and Duty her rule in\r\nevery action of her life--will stand out more clearly perhaps to\r\nfuture generations. But this we know, that during the Victorian era\r\nthe idea of separateness in the interests of men and women has grown\r\nless and less, while co-operation and sympathy have grown more and\r\nmore, so that these words of one of the pioneer thinkers on this\r\nsubject, Mrs. Jameson, have become a key-note to the suffrage\r\nmovement: \"Whatsoever things are good, whatsoever things are wise,\r\nwhatsoever things are holy, must be accomplished by communion between\r\nbrave men and brave women.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWS SPECIALLY AFFECTING WOMEN.\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago married women had no right to their earnings, nor\r\nto dispose of their property; all belonged to the husband unless\r\nsettled on the wife and then it was in keeping of trustees. Mothers\r\nhad no rights in their children. All professions were closed to women.\r\n\r\n_1839._--Custody of Infants Act empowered the Lord Chancellor to leave\r\ncustody of her child to the mother, up to the age of seven, in case of\r\ndivorce.\r\n\r\n_1873._--Custody of Infants Act allowed the mother custody of her\r\nchild to the age of sixteen in case of divorce.\r\n\r\n_1886._--Guardianship of Infants Act gave the right to a surviving\r\nmother to be joint guardian in addition to any appointed by the\r\nfather. The Act also enabled her to appoint a guardian in case of the\r\nfather's death or incapacity; it also required the Court to have\r\nregard to the wishes of the mother as well as of the father.\r\n\r\n_1870-1874._--Married Women's Property Acts secured to them all rights\r\nto property acquired by their own skill and industry, and to all\r\ninvestments of their own money in their own names.\r\n\r\n_1882._--Married Women's Property Act consolidated and amended the\r\nprevious act, enabling married women to acquire, hold and dispose by\r\nwill or otherwise of any real or personal property without the\r\nintervention of a trustee.\r\n\r\n_1876._--Medical Education Act permitted medical degrees to be\r\nconferred on women.\r\n\r\n_1890._--Intestates Act provided that when a man dies intestate\r\nleaving a widow and no children, all his estate if under £500, goes to\r\nthe widow, if over £500 she shall have £500 in addition to her share\r\nin the residue.[487]\r\n\r\n\r\nLAWS RELATING TO LOCAL GOVERNMENT. (SUFFRAGE.)\r\n\r\n_1869._--Municipal Corporations Act restored to women rate-payers of\r\nEngland the vote in Municipal Elections which had been taken away by\r\nthe Municipal Corporation Act of 1835.\r\n\r\n_1870._--Elementary Education Act created School Boards and placed\r\nwomen on a complete equality both as electors and as eligible for\r\nelection.\r\n\r\n_1881-1882._--The Municipal Act for Scotland gave to women the same\r\nMunicipal Franchise possessed by those of England since 1869. They\r\nalready had the School Franchise.\r\n\r\n_1888._--The County Electors Act gave women equal franchises with men\r\nfor the election of Councillors for the County Councils created by the\r\nLocal Government Act of that year.\r\n\r\n_1894._--Local Government Act which reorganised the Parochial Poor-Law\r\nAdministration in the Counties, confirmed the rights of women to all\r\nLocal Franchises and their eligibility as Poor-Law Guardians; and made\r\nthem also eligible as Parish and District Councillors.\r\n\r\n_1896._--Poor-Law Guardian Act for Ireland made women for the first\r\ntime eligible as Poor-Law Guardian.\r\n\r\n_1898._--Irish Local Government Act reorganized the system of Local\r\nGovernment in Ireland on similar lines to that in England. Women who\r\nhad hitherto been excluded from the Municipal Franchise now had all\r\nLocal Franchises conferred on them and were made eligible for Rural\r\nand Urban District Councils.\r\n\r\n_1899._--London Government Act changed the system of Vestries to that\r\nof Borough Councils throughout the Metropolitan Districts. Women had\r\nbeen eligible on the old Vestries and several were then serving. Their\r\nclaim to sit on the new Borough Councils was, however, rejected.\r\n\r\n\r\nWOMEN IN PUBLIC WORK.\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago no offices were held by women beyond such parochial\r\noffices as Sextoness, Overseer and Churchwarden, which they\r\noccasionally filled. Their always-existing right to act as Poor-Law\r\nGuardians seems to have been entirely left in abeyance until the early\r\n'70's, when the attention of public-spirited women was being called to\r\nthe need of reformation in the workhouses.\r\n\r\n_1870._--MEMBERS OF SCHOOL BOARD: Miss Lydia Becker was the first\r\nwoman to be elected to public office by the popular vote. This was at\r\nthe first School Board election in Manchester, in November, 1870. She\r\nwas re-elected at every subsequent triennial election until her death\r\nin 1890. Several were elected in London and other large towns. Their\r\nnumber has gone on slowly increasing, both in towns and rural\r\ndistricts, the women being re-elected again and again whenever they\r\ncontinued to stand.\r\n\r\n_1873._--POOR-LAW INSPECTORS: The first woman was appointed Poor-Law\r\nInspector in 1873. Then for some years there was no other. Two now\r\nfill that office, appointed in 1885 and 1898 respectively.\r\n\r\n_1875._ POOR-LAW GUARDIANS: The first Poor-Law Guardian was elected in\r\n1875. There are now over 1,000 serving as Guardians and District\r\nCouncillors in England, a few in Scotland, and about 90 in Ireland.\r\n\r\n_1892._--ROYAL COMMISSIONS: Women were appointed as Assistant\r\nCommissioners on the Royal Commission of Labor in 1892, and as Royal\r\nCommissioners to enquire into secondary education in 1895.\r\n\r\n_1894._--FACTORY INSPECTORS: The first women Factory Inspectors were\r\nappointed in 1894, and six are now serving.\r\n\r\nThe Education Department also has a few as Inspectors. Local\r\nauthorities in large towns are realizing the value of women as\r\nSanitary Inspectors, and the number of these increases gradually.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTEPS IN EDUCATION.\r\n\r\nHalf a century ago there was not one school or college where women\r\ncould have any approach to University classes. Now there are over\r\n2,000 women graduates, besides 1,500 who hold certificates from Oxford\r\nand Cambridge in place of the degrees which would have been theirs had\r\nthose ancient seats of learning opened their gates to women graduates.\r\nThe following table shows the particulars:\r\n\r\n                                                             Approximate\r\n                                                            total number\r\n                                                            of graduates\r\n  Distribution.

The other\r\nuniversities grant them full degrees.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of an equal standard of knowledge for men and women\r\nhas brought about the result that the achievements of women in\r\nliterature, science and art, once treated as abnormal and exceptional\r\nare now quite normal and usual; and the liberal learning, once\r\nconfined to the very few in favored circumstances, is within the reach\r\nof numbers. As a corollary to this it has been recognized that women's\r\noccupations also deserve systematic training, with the result that\r\nwhen once the training was given the resourcefulness of women has\r\nenabled them to follow out new lines, and a new independence has\r\ndawned upon them. At the same time the sense of personal\r\nresponsibility which comes of independence has made many more women\r\nrealize that they have a duty to the community, and therefore has\r\ncompelled them to set their thoughts and minds to the performance of\r\nthose duties. As a natural consequence the fact is being more and more\r\nrealized by the Electorate and by Government Departments that women\r\ncan bring useful service to the community.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ISLE OF MAN.\r\n\r\n[The ancient kingdom of the Isle of Man, with an independent\r\ngovernment since the time of the vikings, and making its own laws\r\nwhich require only the sanction of the Crown, extended Full Suffrage\r\nto women property owners in December, 1880, and the act received the\r\nassent of Queen Victoria, January 5th, 1881. This was extended to all\r\nwomen rate-payers in 1892.]\r\n\r\n\r\nPROGRESS IN THE COLONIES.\r\n\r\nNEW ZEALAND.[488]\r\n\r\nThe first of the Colonies of the British Empire to grant the\r\nParliamentary Franchise to women was New Zealand, therefore, the story\r\nof Colonial Progress fitly opens with the land of the Maories. The\r\nearliest public mention that this writer has been able to find of the\r\nquestion was in a speech of Sir Julius Vogel to his constituents in\r\n1876, when he said that he was in favor of extending the franchise to\r\nwomen--but as far back as 1869 a pamphlet on the subject, entitled An\r\nAppeal to the Men of New Zealand, had been written by Mrs. Mary\r\nMüller, who may be fitly termed the pioneer woman suffragist of that\r\ncolony.\r\n\r\nIn 1878 the Government introduced an Electoral Bill which included the\r\nfranchise for rate-paying women; this passed the House of\r\nRepresentatives but met with much opposition in the Upper House on\r\npoints unconnected with women's suffrage, so that it was ultimately\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nIn 1887 Sir Julius Vogel, Colonial Treasurer, introduced a Bill\r\ngiving practically universal suffrage to women. This was supported by\r\nthe Premier, Sir Robert Stout, and passed the House of Representatives\r\nMay 12, 1887, by 41 ayes, 22 noes. Several Members stated that they\r\nonly voted for it in the hope that in Committee it would be limited to\r\nowners of property. An amendment proposed to this effect in Committee\r\nwas rejected, but this proved a fatal victory, for when the clause was\r\nput as it stood the \"noes\" carried the day.\r\n\r\nA resolution moved by Sir John Hall in 1890, carried by a majority of\r\n26, was a further note of encouragement.\r\n\r\nThe work for Women's Suffrage was mainly carried on by the Women's\r\nChristian Temperance Union, and they now put forth increased energy,\r\nso that early in 1891 Mrs. Kate W. Sheppard, Franchise Superintendent,\r\nwas able to report that many local unions had appointed franchise\r\nsuperintendents. With what effect they worked was shown when Sir John\r\nHall presented in August, 1891, a petition for the suffrage seventy\r\nyards long, which was run out to the furthest end of the House; a row\r\nof Members ranged themselves on either side to inspect the signatures\r\nand found no two alike, as some seemed to expect. On September 4th Sir\r\nJohn Hall's Bill again passed in the House of Representatives, but was\r\nlost by two votes in the Legislative Council, or Upper House.\r\n\r\nIn 1892 Sir John Hall presented in behalf of the measure the largest\r\npetition ever seen in the New Zealand Parliament. That year the Hon.\r\nJ. Ballance introduced an Electoral Bill on behalf of the Government,\r\nin which the most important new feature was the franchise for women.\r\nIt passed the House of Representatives, but a difference on technical\r\ndetails between the two branches of the Legislature delayed its\r\npassage in the Council.\r\n\r\nIn 1893 the Electoral Act of New Zealand conferred the Franchise on\r\nevery person over twenty-one, although this did not carry the right to\r\nsit in Parliament.\r\n\r\nAs a General Election was close at hand no time was lost in enrolling\r\nwomen on the register. The report of the New Zealand W. C. T. U. of\r\n1893 supplies the following figures:\r\n\r\n                                      Men.      Women.\r\n  On the Register                    177,701   109,461\r\n  Voting at the Poll                 124,439    90,290\r\n\r\nA lady present in Auckland during the election relates that the\r\ninterest taken by the Maori women was very great and that nearly half\r\nthe Maori votes registered in Auckland were those of women.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. H. J. Seddon, Premier of New Zealand, when in England for the\r\ncelebration of the Queen's jubilee in 1897, spoke of the measure as a\r\ngreat success, saying, \"It has come to stay.\" The Bishop of Auckland,\r\nspeaking at the Church Congress in England that year, said \"it had led\r\nto no harm or inconvenience, but the men of New Zealand were wondering\r\nwhy they had permitted the women of that Colony to remain so long\r\nwithout the right to vote in Parliamentary elections.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nSOUTH AUSTRALIA.[489]\r\n\r\nOn July 22d, 1885, Dr. Stirling moved a Resolution in the House of\r\nAssembly in favor of conferring the Franchise for both Houses of the\r\nLegislature, on widows and spinsters who possessed qualifications\r\n(property) which would entitle them to vote for the Legislative\r\nCouncil. The debate was adjourned on the motion of the\r\nAttorney-General and on August 5th the Resolution carried without a\r\ndivision or serious opposition.\r\n\r\nThis favorable start is the more remarkable that there had been no\r\nprevious agitation, no society or committee formed, no petitions\r\npresented, no meetings held. It was a matter of enlightened conviction\r\non the part of the legislators. Dr. Stirling introduced a Bill in\r\n1886, in the same terms as his resolution, and on April 13th it passed\r\nsecond reading by a majority of two of those voting, but as amendments\r\nto the Constitution must have a majority of the whole House, the Bill\r\ncould not be proceeded with. A general election followed soon after,\r\nat which Dr. Stirling did not re-enter Parliament, and Mr. Caldwell\r\ntook charge of the Bill, which in November, 1889, again passed second\r\nreading in the House of Assembly, but again by an insufficient\r\nmajority.\r\n\r\nIn the Summer of 1889 a public meeting was held to form a Women's\r\nSuffrage League, which set to work holding meetings and collecting\r\nsignatures to petitions under the guidance of its Hon. Secretary, Mrs.\r\nMary Lee. The efforts of the parliamentary friends were thrice\r\nbaffled--in 1890, 1891 and 1893--by the necessity for a majority of\r\nthe whole House, which stopped further immediate progress though each\r\ntime the Bill had passed second reading. The growth of support was,\r\nhowever, evidenced by the reply of the Premier to a deputation from\r\nthe Women's Suffrage League in November, 1893--that \"on the question\r\nof Women's Suffrage the Government were in the position of just\r\npersons who needed no conversion, as they were thoroughly at one in\r\nthe matter and were willing to do all they could to place Women's\r\nSuffrage on the Statute Book.\"\r\n\r\nWhen, in August, 1894, the Government brought their Adult Suffrage\r\nBill to the Legislative Council the opponents did their utmost to\r\nbring about its defeat by obstructive amendments, but in vain. Finally\r\nthey moved that the clause prohibiting women from sitting in\r\nParliament be struck out, expecting thereby to wreck the Bill, but the\r\nsupporters of the measure accepted the amendment and so it was carried\r\nby a combination of opponents and supporters, giving women Full\r\nSuffrage and the right to sit in the Parliament. An address and\r\ntestimonial were presented to Mrs. Lee by the Hon. C. C. Kingston, the\r\nPremier, Dr. Cockburn, other Members of Parliament and friends. In\r\nmaking the presentation the Premier said he did so at request of the\r\nCommittee, for her important services in one of the greatest\r\nconstitutional reforms in Australian history. Royal assent was given\r\nto the Bill in 1895.\r\n\r\nThe first election under this Act took place in April, 1896.\r\nStatistics published in the _Australian Register_ of June 10th, give\r\nthe following totals:\r\n\r\n                                                 Men.    Women.\r\n  On the roll in Adelaide and suburbs           30,051   24,585\r\n  On the roll in the country districts          47,701   34,581\r\n  Voting in Adelaide and suburbs                19,938   16,253\r\n  Voting in country districts                   31,634   23,059\r\n  Percentage voting in Adelaide and suburbs      66.34    66.11\r\n  Percentage voting in the country districts     66.32    66.68\r\n\r\nSpeaking at the Annual Meeting of the Central Committee of the Women's\r\nSuffrage Society in London, July 15th, 1898, Dr. Cockburn (now Sir\r\nJohn Cockburn, K. C. M. G.) said: \"The refining influence of women has\r\nmade itself felt in this sphere as in every other: they have elevated\r\nthe whole realm of politics without themselves losing a jot of their\r\ninnate purity. 'No poorer they but richer we,' by their addition to\r\nthe electoral roll.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nWEST AUSTRALIA.[490]\r\n\r\nThe women of West Australia enjoyed the unprecedented experience of\r\nhaving organised their Franchise League and gained the Franchise in\r\none year. The question, however, had been more or less before the\r\nColony since 1893. In that year Mr. Cookworthy had introduced a\r\nWomen's Suffrage Resolution in the House of Assembly which was lost by\r\nonly one vote.\r\n\r\nAfter the next General Election, Mr. Cookworthy again introduced his\r\nResolution in 1897, when it was lost by two votes, one of its\r\nstrongest supporters being absent. Although there was at that time no\r\norganisation specially for the Suffrage, the Women's Christian\r\nTemperance Union did much to extend interest, and there was a large\r\nbody of support to be found amongst the intelligent women of the\r\nColony. This led to the formation of a Women's Franchise League for\r\nWestern Australia.\r\n\r\nThis League was formally organized at a public meeting of the Leisure\r\nHour Club in Perth, May 11th, 1899, Lady Onslow presiding. That autumn\r\na Resolution similar to the one which had been introduced in the\r\nLegislative Assembly passed the Council, and before the year closed\r\nthe Electoral Act was passed of which the important part for women\r\nlies in the interpretation clause, which interprets \"Elector\" as any\r\nperson of either sex whose name is on the Electoral Roll of a province\r\nor district. Royal assent to the Bill was given in 1900. Although\r\nwomen now can vote for members of the Parliament they can not sit in\r\nthat body.\r\n\r\nAlready the Women's Franchise League of Western Australia is\r\ntransformed into the Women's Electoral League.\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW SOUTH WALES.[491]\r\n\r\nThe Mother Colony seems likely to be the next to enfranchise women.\r\nThe question in that Colony first came prominently forward when Sir\r\nHenry Parkes, the veteran statesman and oft-times Premier, proposed a\r\nclause to give equal voting power to women in his Electoral Bill in\r\n1890. The clause was eventually dropped, but the very fact that it had\r\nbeen introduced in a Government Bill by a man of such high position as\r\nSir Henry Parkes gave the question the impetus for which the friends\r\nof the movement were waiting to collect the growing interest into\r\norganized form and combined action.\r\n\r\nOn May 6th, 1891, the Womanhood Suffrage League of New South Wales was\r\nformed, Lady Windeyer was elected president and an active campaign was\r\nbegun. On July 30th Sir Henry Parkes moved a Resolution in the\r\nLegislative Assembly \"that in the opinion of this House the franchise\r\nfor the election of members of the Legislative Assembly should be\r\nextended to women on the same conditions and subject to the same\r\nqualifications as men.\" The debate was a very long one, occupying\r\ntwelve hours and concluding at 3 a. m., when the motion was lost by 34\r\nayes, 57 noes. The friends of Women's Suffrage were in no way cast\r\ndown by this vote. They believed that in a full House on a fair test\r\ndivision their friends would have been in a majority, but many who\r\nwere anxious for the passing of the Electoral Bill voted against Sir\r\nHenry Parkes' motion lest the inclusion of women should imperil its\r\nchances in the Upper House.\r\n\r\nThe next debate on the question was on November 18th, 1894, when Mr.\r\nO'Reilly moved a Resolution that \"in the opinion of this House the\r\ntime has arrived when the franchise should be extended to women.\" This\r\nwas supported by Sir Henry Parkes. The Premier, Sir G. H. Reid,\r\napproved of Women's Suffrage in the abstract but objected that the\r\npresent Parliament had received no mandate from the people. Sir George\r\nDibbs thought the demand a just one. Eventually the motion, with the\r\nwords \"the time has now arrived\" omitted, was carried by a large\r\nmajority. No debate has taken place since 1894, as the pressure on the\r\ntime of the Legislature has been great with Federal and other matters,\r\nbut the question was never in a more hopeful position. The sudden\r\nchange of government in 1899 placed a strong friend to the cause at\r\nthe head of affairs in the present Premier, Sir William Lyne, and at\r\nthe annual meeting of the Suffrage League in August, 1900, Mr. Fegan,\r\nM. P. (Minister for Mines) congratulated the women of New South Wales\r\non being so near the goal of their desires. The Premier had\r\ndefinitely said that before the session closed a Bill would be\r\nintroduced to give women the suffrage, and he hoped that next year\r\nthey would be able to disband their League, its work being finished.\r\nThe Bill was introduced in 1901 but was lost by 19 ayes, 22 noes.\r\n\r\nOn Aug. 14, 1902, the bill conferring the Parliamentary Franchise on\r\nwomen passed the Council. It had already passed the Assembly and is\r\nnow law.\r\n\r\n\r\nVICTORIA.[492]\r\n\r\nIn Melbourne an organisation for Women's Suffrage has been in\r\nexistence some sixteen years, but it is only within the last five\r\nyears that the question has come within the region of practical\r\npolitics. The movement suffered from want of concentration of energy.\r\n\"At one time the original association, though still in existence, was\r\nrivalled by other societies with the same object, but more or less\r\ntinged with local, class or religious characteristics. This rivalry,\r\nthough it tended to the growth of the movement, deprived it of force\r\nand eventually led to divided counsels and consequently to comparative\r\nfailure.\" _The Australian Woman's Sphere_[493] from which the above\r\nwords are quoted, goes on to say: \"A few years since, largely owing to\r\nthe patience and tact of the late Annette Bear Crawford, its first\r\nHon. Secretary, there was formed the 'United Council for Women's\r\nSuffrage' which aimed at including representatives of all the leagues\r\nthat had for their main object, or for one of them, the political\r\nenfranchisement of women.\"\r\n\r\nThe formation of this Council has been the sign of a new life in the\r\nquestion in Melbourne. At the General Election of 1894 a determined\r\neffort was made to secure the return of a majority of members pledged\r\nto vote for the suffrage cause. The Government promised a Bill in the\r\nsession of 1895, and on November 26th the Premier, Sir George Turner,\r\nintroduced a Women's Suffrage Bill which passed the House of Assembly\r\nwithout a division, but was lost in the Legislative Council by two\r\nvotes.\r\n\r\nThe Women's Suffrage Bill passed the Legislative Assembly in 1897,\r\n'98, '99, 1900, '01, each time with an increased majority, but each\r\ntime its progress has been stopped in the Council.\r\n\r\nNevertheless there are many evidences of increasing vitality in the\r\nmovement in Victoria, not the least of these being the rise of an\r\nAnti-Women's Suffrage Crusade. These \"New Crusaders\" have presented a\r\npetition which purports to be signed by 22,987 \"adult women\" of\r\nVictoria. But in 1891 before the suffrage was a live subject, before\r\nit had entered the region of practical politics, the women suffragists\r\nin six weeks obtained 30,000 signatures of adult women. The first and\r\nthe most natural result of the anti-suffrage movement has been to\r\nbring down enquiries on the United Council from all parts of the\r\nColony how to help Women's Suffrage.\r\n\r\n\r\nQUEENSLAND.[494]\r\n\r\nThe Women's Suffrage question appears to have received its first\r\nawakening in Queensland from the visit of Miss Hannah Chenings, who in\r\n1891 came from Adelaide on a lecturing tour in connection with an\r\neffort to obtain a law for the better protection of young girls. Her\r\naccount of the Women's Franchise League in South Australia aroused a\r\nwish for a similar organisation here, and after a period of silent\r\ngrowth the Women's Suffrage Association was formed in 1894, mainly\r\nthrough the instrumentality of Mrs. Leontine Cooper and Mrs. Maginie,\r\nwho, as Miss Allen, had been a member of the New South Wales Society.\r\n\r\nAt the first annual meeting of this association, in March, 1895, the\r\nreport showed that petitions had been presented with over 11,000\r\nsignatures, and that letters expressing themselves as favorable to the\r\nmeasure had been received from thirty Members of the Legislative\r\nAssembly. In the General Election of 1897 a large number of candidates\r\ndeclared themselves in favor, but so far the effort to carry a Bill\r\nthrough the House has met with disappointment, and the Women's\r\nSuffrage Association are bending their efforts towards inducing the\r\nGovernment to bring in a Bill. Here, as in the other Colonies where\r\nthey are still unenfranchised, the women feel deeply the injustice of\r\ntheir exclusion from the Federal Referendum.\r\n\r\n\r\nTASMANIA.[495]\r\n\r\nAs long ago as 1885 a Constitutional Amendment Act passed second\r\nreading in the Tasmanian House of Assembly which provided for the\r\nextension of the Franchise to unmarried women rate-payers, but\r\nnotwithstanding the support of the Government the question made no\r\nfurther advance in Parliament.\r\n\r\nIn recent years a Bill to enfranchise women on the same terms as men\r\nhas passed the House of Assembly on several occasions with increasing\r\nmajorities, but the opponents are still too numerous to carry it\r\nthrough the Upper House. The Women's Christian Temperance Union have\r\nbeen the most energetic workers in its behalf.\r\n\r\n[It will be noticed that in each of these Australian States the\r\nWomen's Suffrage Bill repeatedly passed the Assembly, or Lower House,\r\nwhich is elected by the people, but was defeated in the Council or\r\nUpper House, which is composed entirely of wealthy and aristocratic\r\nmembers, who can be voted for only by these classes, and some of whom\r\nare appointed by the Government and hold office for life. In 1901 a\r\nFederation of the six States was formed with a National Parliament,\r\nboth Houses to be elected by the people. In June, 1902, a bill passed\r\nthis Federal Parliament giving women the right to vote for its members\r\nand be elected to this body. About 800,000 women have been thus\r\nenfranchised, the largest victory ever gained for this movement.\r\n\r\nIn South and West Australia and New South Wales women may vote for\r\nmembers of the State Parliament. In Victoria, Queensland and Tasmania\r\nthey may vote for the Federal but not for the State Parliament, an\r\nanomaly which doubtless will be very soon rectified. It is possible\r\nthat before this volume is read all the women of the six Australian\r\nStates will possess the full franchise by constitutional right.--Eds.]\r\n\r\nIn the South African Colonies there has been, as yet, no history to\r\nrecord. That the question simmers in many thoughtful minds there can\r\nscarcely be a doubt, but the time for organised action does not seem\r\nto have yet arrived.\r\n\r\nThe other Colonies of Great Britain, with the exception of Canada, are\r\nnot self-governing.\r\n\r\n\r\nDOMINION OF CANADA.\r\n\r\nThe story of the movement to obtain the Parliamentary Franchise in the\r\nDominion dates back to 1883. In April of that year the Premier, Sir\r\nJohn Macdonald, introduced a Bill in the Legislature for amending the\r\nelectoral law, including a clause which gave the suffrage to unmarried\r\nwomen who possessed the necessary qualifications.\r\n\r\nPreviously, on March 9th, the Toronto Women's Literary and Social\r\nProgress Club had gathered in public for the first time in the City\r\nCouncil Chamber to consider the Suffrage question. Mrs. McEwan\r\npresided and a paper \"treating pithily and with much aptness on the\r\nsubject of the Franchise\" was read by Miss E. Foulds, who moved a\r\nResolution \"that in the opinion of this Meeting the Parliamentary\r\nFranchise should be extended to women who possess the qualifications\r\nwhich entitle men to vote.\" This and a second resolution proposing the\r\nformation of a society to forward such legislation as might be\r\nrequired were both carried, many ladies and gentlemen speaking in\r\ntheir support and a large number of those present giving in their\r\nnames as members. On April 5th an adjourned meeting was held and the\r\nCanadian Women's Suffrage Association was constituted.\r\n\r\nSir John Macdonald's Bill was presented too late to become a law and\r\nwas re-introduced in 1884. It was in this year that members of the\r\nBritish Suffrage Association visited Canada. Miss Lydia Becker and\r\nMrs. Lilias Ashworth Hallett were among them, and they and several\r\nother English ladies united in sending an address to Sir John\r\nMacdonald thanking him for the introduction of provisions in his Bill\r\nto enable women to vote and expressing their high appreciation of the\r\njust and generous spirit which had actuated him. Mrs. Hallett had some\r\nconversation with Sir John Hall, who told her the only difficulty they\r\nexpected in Canada as regarded passing the Bill was from the French\r\npopulation. This expectation proved to be well-founded. The Women's\r\nSuffrage Clauses were rejected by 51 ayes, 78 noes, after a debate\r\nextending over thirty-one consecutive hours.\r\n\r\nIt was ten years before any further effort was made to secure the\r\nParliamentary Franchise. In 1894 a petition for this, in behalf of the\r\nWomen's Christian Temperance Union, supplemented by memorials from the\r\nProvinces, was presented by Sir James Grant to the House of Commons,\r\nand by the Hon. Mr. Scott to the Senate, but no resolution was\r\noffered. A Bill introduced by Mr. Dickey, dealing with the electoral\r\nfranchise, contained a clause asking suffrage for widows and\r\nspinsters, but the Bill was read only once. Mr. Davis, unsolicited,\r\nbrought in a resolution for Women's Franchise on the same terms as\r\nmen. Forty members voted for it, one hundred and five against it.\r\n\r\nA petition for the Parliamentary Franchise for women, very largely\r\nsigned by Federal voters throughout the Dominion, was presented to the\r\nHouse of Commons and the Senate in 1896. This was the last effort in\r\nthe Parliament, and as a change has since been made in the Electoral\r\nAct, making the voters' list for the Dominion coincide with the\r\nProvincial lists, the battle will therefore have to be fought out in\r\neach separate Province.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PRESENT POLITICAL CONDITION.[496]\r\n\r\nWomen in Canada have no vote for any law maker, either Federal or\r\nProvincial. Their franchise is confined to municipalities, which can\r\nonly make by-laws that relate to the execution of existing laws. But\r\nalthough women have no direct vote, they have, by much labor and\r\nunited effort, effected some important changes in the criminal code\r\nand civil laws, as well as in the political position of women in the\r\nmunicipalities. The societies which have accomplished the most, if not\r\nall, of these changes are the Women's Christian Temperance Union, the\r\nWomen's Enfranchisement Association and the National Council of Women.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Ontario, in 1884, widows and spinsters were given\r\nthe Municipal Franchise on the same terms as men. All women, married\r\nor single, if owners of property, may vote on money by-laws where such\r\nare submitted to the electors. Any woman on the assessment roll may\r\nvote for School Trustees and is eligible for this office. In 1892 it\r\nwas enacted that women might study law and qualify for the Bar. In\r\n1893 a Bill to give Municipal Suffrage to married women and one to\r\ngrant the Provincial Suffrage to all women were defeated by 16 ayes,\r\n53 noes.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of New Brunswick the Legislature in 1886 gave,\r\nunsolicited, to widows and spinsters the right to vote on the same\r\nterms as men at Municipal elections. In 1893 an Act was passed\r\npermitting the appointment of a woman as School Trustee. This was\r\namended in 1896 making it compulsory that two on each Board shall be\r\nwomen.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Nova Scotia the Municipal Franchise was granted to\r\nwidows and spinsters in 1887. A Bill for the Provincial Franchise was\r\ndefeated in 1893; and again in 1894 by one vote. An Act of 1895\r\npermits all women, if rate-payers, to vote on School matters. A\r\nmarried woman having property in her own right, provided that her\r\nhusband is disqualified, may vote in Municipal elections under the\r\nMarried Woman's Property Act, since 1891. In the city of Halifax\r\nwidows and spinsters who are rate-payers may vote on Municipal\r\nquestions. In 1894 a Bill giving women a more extended suffrage was\r\nlost by seven votes; in 1895 by four votes; in 1899 a Bill for the\r\nfull Provincial Franchise was lost by twenty-seven votes.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Prince Edward Island, in 1888, the Municipal\r\nSuffrage was granted to widows and spinsters owning property. An Act\r\nof 1899 made women eligible to appointment on School Boards.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of British Columbia, in 1888, the Municipal Franchise\r\nwas conferred on widows and spinsters owning property. An Act of 1891\r\nallows the wife of any householder or freeholder to vote on School\r\nmatters but not to hold office; in 1897 the Act was amended making\r\nthem eligible as School Trustees. This same year all women rate-payers\r\nwere given the Municipal Franchise. Only owners of property may vote\r\non by-laws for raising money upon the credit of the municipality.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Manitoba, in 1891, the Municipal Franchise was\r\nextended to women. Any qualified woman rate-payer can vote on School\r\nquestions and is eligible for School offices. Women property owners\r\nmay vote on all submitted by-laws. In 1892 a measure to give women the\r\nfull Provincial Suffrage was defeated by 28 ayes, 11 noes.\r\n\r\nIn the Province of Quebec, in 1892, the Municipal and School Franchise\r\nwas conferred on widows and spinsters on the same terms as on men. The\r\nlaw relating to the right of women to sit on the School Board was\r\nambiguous, so a petition was presented that they be declared eligible.\r\nThe response to this was an amendment excluding women. In Montreal,\r\nunder the old charter, only widows and spinsters who owned property\r\nhad the Municipal Franchise; in 1899 this was amended, adding tenancy\r\nwith residence as a qualification. In 1898 a Bill granting them the\r\nProvincial Suffrage was lost on division.\r\n\r\nIn the Northwest Territories, in 1894, the Municipal Franchise was\r\ngranted to widows and spinsters. In School matters every woman\r\nrate-payer can vote and is eligible to School offices.[497]\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[483] The women of Great Britain and Ireland possess every franchise\r\nexcept that for members of Parliament. Local suffrage is restricted to\r\nspinsters and widows, but the important vote for Parish and District\r\nCouncils, created by the Local Government Act of 1894, is possessed by\r\nmarried women \"provided husband and wife shall not both be qualified\r\nin respect to the same piece of property.\" It may be stated in general\r\nterms that all electors must be rate-payers, although there are some\r\nexceptions applying to a small percentage of persons.

The petition of 1873 was\r\nsigned by 11,000 women. The petition presented to the members of the\r\nlast Parliament was signed by 257,796 women. [Eds.\r\n\r\n[487] No reference has been made in the above table to the various\r\nFactory Acts which impose restrictions on women's labour--these belong\r\nto a different department--but whether their interference with the\r\nlabor of women be for good or for evil, that interference is an\r\nadditional argument for allowing them a voice in the election of\r\nrepresentatives.\r\n\r\n[488] In 1877 New Zealand granted School Suffrage to women, and in\r\n1886 Municipal Suffrage.\r\n\r\n[489] In 1880 South Australia granted Municipal Suffrage to women.\r\n\r\n[490] In 1871 West Australia granted Municipal Suffrage to women.\r\n\r\n[491] In 1867 New South Wales granted Municipal Suffrage to women.\r\n\r\n[492] In 1869 Victoria granted Municipal Suffrage to women.\r\n\r\n[493] The first number of _The Australian Woman's Sphere_ was\r\npublished in Melbourne, September 1, 1900.

Married women may vote in\r\nthe election of School Trustees. It has recently been decided that a\r\nman possessing no property of his own, and not being a householder in\r\nhis own right, may be allowed to vote in municipal matters if his wife\r\nbe a property owner or a householder. [Eds.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXIV.\r\n\r\nWOMAN SUFFRAGE IN OTHER COUNTRIES.\r\n\r\n\r\nIn most of the countries of the world women possess some form of\r\nsuffrage, but for many reasons it is almost impossible to define\r\nexactly in what it consists. Like suffrage for men it is largely based\r\non property, and in most cases can be used only through a proxy.\r\nGenerally the woman loses the franchise by marriage and the husband\r\nmay vote by right of the wife's property. In Belgium, Luxemburg, Italy\r\nand Roumania the husband votes at local elections by right of the\r\ntaxes paid by the wife, and in case of a widow this right belongs to\r\nthe eldest son, grandson or great grandson, or if there is none, then\r\nto the son-in-law. The Italian electoral law of 1870 gave a widow the\r\nright to vote by proxy in Parliamentary elections. All the Italian\r\nuniversities are open to women.\r\n\r\nThe constitution of Germany says \"every German\" above twenty-five\r\nyears of age shall have the Parliamentary Franchise, but no woman ever\r\nhas been permitted to vote under it. There are, besides, twenty-five\r\nconstitutions for the different States which form the Empire. By the\r\nwording of some of them, women landed proprietors undoubtedly are\r\nentitled to take part in elections. The Prussian code declares that\r\nthe rights of the two sexes are equal, if no special laws fix an\r\nexception, and it gives the Parliamentary Franchise to _every one_ who\r\npossesses the county or burgess suffrage. The by-laws which prescribe\r\nthe qualifications for the latter in some instances exclude women and\r\nin others declare that women land holders may act as electors, but\r\nonly \"through a proctor\" (proxy). Teachers undoubtedly, as State\r\nofficials, are entitled to take part in local government. Some of the\r\nprovinces allow women taxpayers to vote by proxy in the rural\r\ndistricts. Neither the Government nor public sentiment, however, looks\r\nwith favor upon women electors. It is only in recent years that a few\r\nof the most advanced have begun to agitate the question in this\r\ncountry, which holds a most conservative attitude towards women. They\r\nhave recently been admitted to a few of the universities.\r\n\r\nIn most of the Prussian towns the property qualifications of the wife\r\nare accounted to the husband in order that he may take part in\r\nmunicipal elections. In Saxony women proprietors of landed estates,\r\nwhether married or single, are entitled to a municipal vote but this\r\ncan be exercised only by proxy, and for this purpose one of their male\r\nrelatives must be invested with their property. In Saxony, Baden,\r\nWurtemburg, Hesse, the Thuringian States and perhaps a few more, women\r\nare permitted to attend public political meetings and be members of\r\npolitical societies, but in all other German States they are excluded\r\nfrom both. They are thus prohibited from forming organizations to\r\nsecure the franchise. In Westphalia since 1856, and Schleswig-Holstein\r\nsince 1867, all qualified women have some form of suffrage by male\r\nproxy.\r\n\r\nIn the Austro-Hungarian Empire, since 1862, women with property have a\r\nproxy vote in municipal and provincial elections and for members of\r\nthe Lower House of the Parliament, but there are many restrictions to\r\nthis law. In Bohemia, since 1873, women who are large landed\r\nproprietors have a proxy vote for members of the Imperial Parliament\r\nand the local Diet.\r\n\r\nIn Russia among the peasant class the representative of the household\r\nvotes. The wife, if owner of the necessary amount of property, may\r\nselect her husband as proxy, but he may also delegate his vote to the\r\nwife, and it is a common thing to see her take his place at elections\r\nand at village and country meetings of all kinds. In the cities and\r\nterritorial assemblies, women, married or unmarried, possessing\r\nsufficient property, may vote by male proxy for members of the\r\nmunicipal and county assemblies. Property-owning women of the nobility\r\nmay vote by proxy in the assemblies of the nobility. Part of the\r\nuniversities are open to them. There are 650 women physicians in\r\nRussia.\r\n\r\nSo far as can be learned women are not eligible to office in the\r\nabove-mentioned countries with a very few exceptions.\r\n\r\nIn Finland, since 1865, widows and spinsters may vote at rural\r\nelections; since 1873 those who are rate-payers may vote at municipal\r\nelections. Since 1889 women are eligible as Guardians of the Poor. In\r\n1900 they were made eligible to all municipal offices. An influential\r\nFinnish Woman's Association with twenty branches is agitating for\r\nsuffrage on the same terms as men.\r\n\r\nIn Holland there is no form of woman suffrage and the constitution of\r\n1887 expressly prohibits it.\r\n\r\nWomen in Denmark have no franchise, but Premier Duentzer has announced\r\nthat the first reform movement of the new Cabinet (1901) will be the\r\nextension of Municipal Suffrage to women.\r\n\r\nIn 1893, through the efforts of the Socialists, universal suffrage was\r\ngranted to men in Belgium. While this gives to every man a vote, it\r\npermits to the married man, if he pays a small tax, two votes as the\r\nhead of a family; if he pays tax on what would be about $2,000, or has\r\na university degree, he is allowed three votes. The vast majority of\r\nthose owning property or possessing university degrees belong to the\r\nestablished (Catholic) Church, and the Socialists soon found\r\nthemselves out-voted by a minority. They then instituted a new\r\nmovement demanding \"one man, one vote,\" and the Government, which is\r\nCatholic, said: \"If you compel this we will enfranchise women,\"\r\nbelieving that this would strengthen its power. At this writing the\r\ncontest is going on and becoming more violent.\r\n\r\nSwitzerland, whose pride is its absolutely republican form of\r\ngovernment, allows no woman a vote on any question or for the election\r\nof any officer. They are admitted to the universities.\r\n\r\nIn France, in 1898, unmarried women engaged in commerce (including\r\nmarket women, etc.) were given a vote for Judges of the Tribunals of\r\nCommerce. A Woman Suffrage Society has just been formed in Paris which\r\nis attracting considerable attention. Women are admitted to the\r\nhighest institutions of learning.\r\n\r\nThe laws in all the countries thus far mentioned are most unjust to\r\nwomen and especially to wives.\r\n\r\nWomen in Sweden have voted in church matters since 1736. It was\r\nprovided in 1862 that women who are rate-payers may vote directly or\r\nby proxy, as they choose, for all officers except for members of the\r\nParliament. Indirectly they have a voice in the election of the First\r\nChamber or House of Lords, as they vote for the County Council which\r\nelects this body. They have School and Municipal Suffrage and that for\r\nProvincial representatives. The laws are very liberal to women. All\r\nof the educational institutions, the professions, occupations and many\r\nof the offices are open to them. They are members of the Boards of\r\nEducation, Municipal Relief Committees and Parochial Boards. About six\r\nhundred have received university degrees.\r\n\r\nIn Norway, since 1889, in towns women with children may vote for\r\nschool inspectors and be eligible to the school boards. In rural\r\ncommunes they are eligible as inspectors, and women who pay a school\r\ntax may vote on all school questions and officers, while those who pay\r\nno tax but have children may vote on all questions not involving\r\nexpenditures. In 1884 a Woman Suffrage Association was formed under\r\nthe leadership of Miss Gina Krog for the purpose of securing the\r\nMunicipal Franchise. In 1890 a bill for this purpose received 44 out\r\nof 114 votes in the Parliament. It was then made an issue by the\r\nLiberal party. In 1895 a vote on Local Option was granted to women. In\r\n1898 the Radical party secured universal suffrage for men without\r\nproperty restrictions. They then came to the assistance of women and\r\nwere joined by a large number of Conservatives. In 1901 Municipal\r\nSuffrage was granted to all women who pay taxes on an income of 300\r\ncrowns ($71) in country districts and 400 in cities. If husband and\r\nwife together pay taxes on this amount both may vote. About 200,000\r\nwomen thus became electors. Women are found in many offices, in most\r\noccupations and professions, and are admitted to all educational\r\ninstitutions.\r\n\r\nIceland, since 1882, grants Municipal Suffrage to tax-paying widows\r\nand spinsters; since 1886 all women have had a parish suffrage, which\r\nenables them to vote in the selection of the clergy, who have a\r\nprominent part in public affairs.\r\n\r\nAt the Cape of Good Hope women have a limited vote. In the tiny Island\r\nof Pitcairn, in the Southern Pacific, they have the same suffrage as\r\nmen. This is doubtless true of many isolated localities whose records\r\nare little known. Among primitive peoples the government is generally\r\nin the hands of the most competent without regard to sex, and some of\r\nthese are still under the reign of the Matriarchate, or the rule of\r\nmothers, to whom belong the property and the children. The early\r\nSpanish inhabitants of the North American continent placed much\r\nauthority in the hands of women, and the same is true of the Indian\r\ntribes.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER LXXV.\r\n\r\nNATIONAL ORGANIZATIONS OF WOMEN.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe most conspicuous and significant movement which challenges\r\nattention at the beginning of the new century is that toward\r\norganization, and the three great combinations which stand out most\r\nprominently in interest and importance are the organization of\r\ncapital, the organization of labor and the organization of women. We\r\nscarcely can go back so far in history as not to find men banded\r\ntogether to protect their mutual interests, but associations of women\r\nare of very modern date. The oldest on record was formed in\r\nPhiladelphia, in the closing days of the eighteenth century--Female\r\nSociety for the Relief and Employment of the Poor--which in 1798\r\nestablished a house of industry in Arch St., known as the Home for\r\nSpinners. The society is still in active existence and gives\r\nemployment to a large number of women. Church Missionary Societies of\r\nWomen had their origin early in the century, but as mere annexes to\r\nthose officered and managed by men. The first association to approach\r\nnational prominence was the Female Anti-Slavery Society, founded in\r\nBoston in 1833, which almost cost the reputation of every one who\r\njoined it, so strong was the prejudice against any public action on\r\nthe part of women. The American Female Guardian Society and Home for\r\nthe Friendless was established in New York in 1834, and still exists,\r\nhaving cared for 50,000 children. Later in this decade Female Bible\r\nSocieties came into being to supply Bibles to penal and charitable\r\ninstitutions and to put them in various public places.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MRS. IDA HUSTED HARPER.\r\n\r\nAuthor of Life and Work of Susan B. Anthony, and Joint Editor with her\r\nof The History of Woman Suffrage, Vol. IV.]\r\n\r\nFrom 1840 to 1850 the old Washingtonian Societies, composed entirely\r\nof men, were gradually replaced by the Sons of Temperance, and as they\r\nalso were decidedly averse to receiving women into their organization,\r\nand as the latter were deeply interested in the subject, a few of them\r\ntimidly formed the Daughters of Temperance, in the face of extreme\r\nopposition on the part of both sexes. In the decade following\r\ncommenced the agitation of the question of Woman Suffrage, and soon\r\nconventions in its interest began to be of frequent occurrence, to the\r\njoy of the newspapers, most of which treated them with ridicule and\r\ndenunciation.\r\n\r\nThe decade ushered in by 1860 brought the long Civil War, during\r\nwhich, in the Sanitary Commission, the Woman's Loyal League, the\r\nFreedmen's Bureau and other associations, women displayed an\r\nunsuspected power of organization, and at its close their status in\r\nmany ways was completely changed and greatly advanced.\r\n\r\nIn 1868 the country was electrified by the advent of Sorosis in New\r\nYork City and the New England Woman's Club in Boston. These were the\r\nfirst societies formed by women purely for their own recreation and\r\nimprovement--all others had been for the purpose of reforming the weak\r\nand sinful or assisting the needy and unfortunate--and they met with a\r\nstorm of derision and protest from all parts of the country, which\r\ntheir founders courageously ignored. The last quarter of a century has\r\nwitnessed so many organizations of women that it would be practically\r\nimpossible to record even their names. Every village which is big\r\nenough for a church contains also a woman's club, and they exist in\r\nmany country neighborhoods. In the larger cities single societies have\r\nfrom 500 to 1,000 members, and in a number handsome club houses have\r\nbeen built and furnished, some of them costing from $50,000 to\r\n$80,000.\r\n\r\nFrom 1850 the annual conventions in the interest of Woman's Rights\r\nwere called under the auspices of a Central Committee, but in 1869 the\r\nNational and American Woman Suffrage Associations were formed. Five\r\nyears later the Woman's Christian Temperance Union sprang into\r\nexistence. There are now more than one hundred associations of women\r\nin the United States which are national in their form and aims, and a\r\nnumber have become international through their alliance with those of\r\nother countries. In 1888, in Washington City, the National Council of\r\nWomen, a heroic undertaking, was founded to gather these vast and\r\ndiverse organizations into one great body. By 1900 sixteen had become\r\nthus affiliated, representing a membership of about 1,125,000 women.\r\n\r\nAn International Council also was organized in 1888 to be composed of\r\nsimilar National Councils in various countries and to meet in a\r\nCongress every five years. At the close of the century fourteen\r\nNational Councils had affiliated with the International, representing\r\na membership of 6,000,000. This is not only immeasurably larger than\r\nany other association of women but is exceeded in size by very few\r\norganizations of men, and its two great Congresses--during the\r\nColumbian Exposition at Chicago in 1893, and at London in 1899--were\r\noccasions of world-wide interest and value.\r\n\r\nEach of the more than one hundred national associations of women in\r\nthe United States holds its annual, biennial or triennial convention\r\nin some one of the large cities, which is attended by delegates from\r\nall parts of the country. The sessions are presided over by a woman,\r\ndiscussions are carried on with due attention to parliamentary usage,\r\na large amount of business is transacted with system and accuracy, and\r\nin every respect these meetings compare favorably with those conducted\r\nby men after centuries of experience. They are treated with the\r\ngreatest respect by the newspapers which vie with each other in\r\npublishing pictures of the delegates, their addresses and extended and\r\ncomplimentary reports of the proceedings. The character of these\r\nnational organizations, the scope of their objects and the extent of\r\ntheir achievements can in no way be so strikingly illustrated as by\r\ngiving a list of the most important.[498]\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF WOMEN was organized March 31, 1888, in\r\nWashington, D. C., \"to unite the women of all the countries in the\r\nworld for the promotion of co-operative internationalism through the\r\nabatement of that prejudice which springs from ignorance and which\r\ncan be corrected only by that knowledge which results from personal\r\nacquaintance.\r\n\r\n\"In the first place its influence has united different organizations\r\nof the same country hitherto indifferent or inimical to each other;\r\nand in the second it has commenced the work of uniting the women of\r\ndifferent nations and abating race prejudice. It has promoted the\r\nmovement of peace and arbitration, and through its international\r\ncommittees it is forming a central bureau of information in regard to\r\nwomen's contribution to the work of the world.\"\r\n\r\nIt is composed at present of fourteen National Councils of as many\r\ndifferent countries representing an individual membership of about\r\n6,000,000 women. Its president is Mrs. May Wright Sewall, who was one\r\nof its founders.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF WOMEN was organized in Washington, D. C.,\r\nMarch 31, 1888. Its constitution is introduced by the following\r\npreamble:\r\n\r\n\"We, women of the United States, sincerely believing that the best\r\ngood of our homes and nation will be advanced by our own greater unity\r\nof thought, sympathy and purpose, and that an organized movement of\r\nwomen will best conserve the highest good of the family and the State,\r\ndo hereby band ourselves together in a confederation of workers\r\ncommitted to the overthrow of all forms of ignorance and injustice,\r\nand to the application of the Golden Rule to society, custom and law.\r\nThis Council is organized in the interest of no one propaganda, and\r\nhas no power over its auxiliaries beyond that of suggestion and\r\nsympathy; therefore, no society voting to become auxiliary shall\r\nthereby render itself liable to be interfered with in respect to its\r\ncomplete organic unity, independence or methods of work, or be\r\ncommitted to any principle or method of any other society or to any\r\nutterance or act of the Council itself, beyond compliance with the\r\nterms of this constitution.\"\r\n\r\nThe scope of the Council's work is indicated by the heads of its\r\ndepartments: Home Life, Educational Interests, Church and Missionary\r\nWork, Temperance, Art, Moral Reform, Political Conditions,\r\nPhilanthropy, Social Economics, Foreign Relations, Press,\r\nOrganization; and by its standing committees: Citizenship, Domestic\r\nScience, Equal Pay for Equal Work, Dress Reform, Social Purity,\r\nDomestic Relations under the Law, Press, Care of Dependent and\r\nDelinquent Children, Peace and Universal Arbitration.\r\n\r\nEach of these departments and committees works along its special lines\r\nand at the annual executive meetings and the triennial Councils the\r\nreports of their work are discussed, their recommendations considered\r\nand every possible assistance rendered. The general public is invited\r\nto the evening sessions and valuable addresses are made by specialists\r\non the above and other important subjects.\r\n\r\nThe Council is composed of sixteen national organizations, one State\r\nCouncil, six local councils--representing a membership of about\r\n1,125,000 women.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL WOMAN'S CHRISTIAN TEMPERANCE UNION was organized in\r\nCleveland, Ohio, Nov. 18-20, 1874, to carry the precepts of the\r\nfollowing pledge into the practice of everyday life: \"I hereby\r\nsolemnly promise, God helping me, to abstain from all distilled,\r\nfermented and malt liquors, including wine, beer and cider, and to\r\nemploy all proper means to discourage the use of and traffic in the\r\nsame.\"\r\n\r\nIts object was further stated as follows: \"To confirm and enforce the\r\nrationale of this pledge, we declare our purpose to educate the young;\r\nto form a better public sentiment; to reform, so far as possible, by\r\nreligious, ethical and scientific means, the drinking classes; to seek\r\nthe transforming power of divine grace for ourselves and all for whom\r\nwe work, that they and we may wilfully transcend no law of pure and\r\nwholesome living; and finally we pledge ourselves to labor and to pray\r\nthat all these principles, founded upon the Gospel of Christ, may be\r\nworked out into the Customs of Society and the Laws of the Land.\"\r\n\r\nThe W. C. T. U. is held to be the most perfectly organized body of\r\nwomen in existence. It originated the idea of Scientific Temperance\r\nInstruction in the public schools and has secured mandatory laws in\r\nevery State and a federal law governing the District of Columbia, the\r\nTerritories and all Indian and military schools supported by the\r\nGovernment; 16,000,000 children in the public schools receive\r\ninstruction under these laws as to the nature and effect of alcohol\r\nand other narcotics on the human system. Through its efforts the\r\nquarterly temperance lesson was included in the International Sunday\r\nSchool Lesson Series in 1884, and a World's Universal Temperance\r\nSunday was secured; 250,000 children are taught scientific reasons for\r\ntemperance in the Loyal Temperance Legions, and all these children are\r\npledged to total abstinence and trained as temperance workers. W. C.\r\nT. U. Schools of Methods are held in all Chautauqua gatherings.\r\n\r\nThis organization has largely influenced the change in public\r\nsentiment in regard to social drinking, equal suffrage, equal purity\r\nfor both sexes, equal remuneration for work equally well done, equal\r\neducational, professional and industrial opportunities for women. It\r\nhas been a chief factor in State campaigns for statutory prohibition,\r\nconstitutional amendment, reform laws in general and those for the\r\nprotection of women and children in particular, and in securing\r\nanti-gambling and anti-cigarette laws. It has been instrumental in\r\nraising the \"age of protection\" for girls in many States and in\r\nobtaining curfew laws in 400 towns and cities. It aided in securing\r\nthe Anti-Canteen Amendment to the Army Bill (1900) which prohibits the\r\nsale of intoxicating liquors at all army posts. It helped to\r\ninaugurate police matrons who are now required in nearly all the large\r\ncities of the United States. It organized Mothers' Meetings in\r\nthirty-seven States before any other society took up the work.\r\nIllinois alone has held 2,000 Mothers' Meetings in a single year.\r\n\r\nIt keeps a superintendent of legislation in Washington during the\r\nentire session of Congress to look after reform bills. It aided in\r\npreventing the repeal of the prohibitory law in Indian Territory, the\r\nresubmission of the prohibitory constitution of Maine, and in\r\npreserving the prohibitory law of Vermont. It has secured 20,000,000\r\nsignatures and attestations, including 7,000,000 on the Polyglot\r\nPetition to the governments of the world. Thousands of girls have been\r\nrescued from lives of shame and tens of thousands of men have signed\r\nthe total abstinence pledge and been redeemed from inebriety through\r\nits efforts.\r\n\r\nThe association protests against the legalizing of all crimes,\r\nespecially those of prostitution and liquor selling. It protests\r\nagainst the sale of liquor in Soldiers' Homes, where now an aggregate\r\nof $253,027 is spent annually for intoxicating liquors, and only about\r\none-fifth of the soldiers' pension money is sent home to their\r\nfamilies. It protests against the United States Government receiving a\r\nrevenue for liquors sold within prohibitory territory, either local or\r\nState, and against all complicity of the Federal Government with the\r\nliquor traffic. It protests against lynching and lends its aid in\r\nfavor of the enforcement of law. It works for the highest well-being\r\nof our soldiers and sailors and especially for suitable temperance\r\ncanteens and a generous mess. It works for the protection of the home,\r\nespecially against its chief enemy, the liquor traffic, and for the\r\nredemption of our Government from this curse, by the prohibition of\r\nthe manufacture and sale of intoxicating liquors for beverage\r\npurposes.\r\n\r\nThe organizing of this great society in the various States and\r\nTerritories, and the systematizing of the work under forty different\r\ndepartments, is due to the efforts of Miss Frances E. Willard more\r\nthan to any other one person, and its success is indebted largely to\r\nher ability and personal popularity. As its president until her death\r\nin 1898, she not only perfected the organization in this country, but\r\noriginated the idea of the Polyglot Petition and of the World's W. C.\r\nT. U., which was organized under the auspices of that of the United\r\nStates. It now includes fifty-eight different countries and has\r\n500,000 members.\r\n\r\nThe official organ, _The Union Signal_, a weekly of sixteen pages, is\r\nissued by the Woman's Temperance Publishing Association of Chicago,\r\nwhich publishes also _The Young Crusader_ and many books and leaflets.\r\nThe National W. C. T. U. gives away 5,000,000 pages of literature per\r\nyear, exclusive of that circulated by the States and different\r\ndepartments. It has received and expended since its organization in\r\nround numbers $400,000. This does not include the large expenditures\r\nof the various State and local unions.\r\n\r\nEvery State and Territory in the United States, including Alaska and\r\nHawaii, has a W. C. T. U., and one is beginning in the Philippines.\r\nThese are auxiliary to the National. It is organized locally in over\r\n10,000 cities and towns. The Young Woman's Christian Temperance Union\r\nis called a branch, also the Loyal Temperance Legions among children.\r\nThere are thirty-eight other departments, and it is usual to include\r\nthe two branches and speak of forty departments. The membership paying\r\ndues is 300,000. There was a gain of 15,000 members this year above\r\nall losses.\r\n\r\nThe Frances E. Willard National Temperance Hospital and Training\r\nSchool for Nurses, in Chicago, is owned and controlled by an\r\nincorporated board of thirty trustees. Its basic principle is the cure\r\nof disease without the use of alcohol as an active medicinal agent.\r\nEminent physicians are on the staff and every effort is made to have\r\nit rank with the very best of hospitals.\r\n\r\nAt the national convention in Washington, D. C., in 1900, fifty States\r\nand Territories were represented by 509 delegates. Mrs. Lillian M. N.\r\nStevens succeeded Miss Willard as president.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE AMERICAN NATIONAL RED CROSS SOCIETY was organized March 1, 1882,\r\nwith headquarters at Washington, D. C. Its object is the relief of\r\nsuffering by war, pestilence, famine, flood, fires, and other\r\ncalamities of sufficient magnitude to be deemed national in extent. It\r\nis governed by the provisions of the International Convention of Aug.\r\n22, 1864, at Geneva, Switzerland.\r\n\r\nUp to the present time relief has been given on fields as follows:\r\nMichigan forest fires, 1881, material and money, $80,000; Mississippi\r\nfloods, 1882, money and seeds, $8,000; Mississippi floods, 1883,\r\nmaterial and seeds, $18,500; Mississippi cyclone, 1883, money, $1,000;\r\nBalkan war, 1883, money, $500; Ohio and Mississippi river floods,\r\n1884, food, clothing, tools, housefurnishings and feed for stock,\r\n$175,000; Texas famine, 1885, appropriations and contributions,\r\n$120,000; Charleston, S. C., earthquake, 1886, money, $500; Mt.\r\nVernon, Ill., cyclone, 1888, money and supplies, $85,000; Florida\r\nyellow fever epidemic, 1888, physicians and nurses, $15,000;\r\nJohnstown, Pa., flood disaster, 1889, money and all kinds of building\r\nmaterial, furniture, etc., $250,000; Russian famine, 1891-2, food,\r\n$125,000; Pomeroy, Ia., cyclone, 1893, money and nurses, $2,700; South\r\nCarolina Islands hurricane and tidal wave disaster, money and all\r\nkinds of supplies, material, tools, seeds, lumber, $65,000;\r\nreconcentrado relief in Cuba, 1898-9, $500,000; American-Spanish War,\r\n1898-9, $450,000; Galveston flood and hurricane, 1900, $120,000;\r\ntotal, $2,016,200.\r\n\r\nMiss Clara Barton was its principal founder and has been its president\r\ncontinuously.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASSOCIATION OF COLLEGIATE ALUMNAE was organized January 14, 1882;\r\nincorporated by special act of the Massachusetts Legislature, April\r\n20, 1899, to unite the alumnae of different institutions for practical\r\neducational work.\r\n\r\nFrom 1890 to 1901 the association gave fourteen $500 European\r\nfellowships (sharing two others) and ten $300 American fellowships.\r\nAmong those holding the fellowships was the first woman admitted to\r\nthe laboratory of the United States Fish Commission, the first woman\r\nto receive the Ph. D. degree from Yale, the first woman admitted to\r\nGöttingen University, the first woman permitted to work in the\r\nbiological laboratory at Strasburg University, the first American\r\nwoman to receive the degree of Ph. D. from any German university, and\r\nthe first American woman to receive a Ph. D. from Göttingen and\r\nHeidelberg Universities.\r\n\r\nThe character of the work accomplished by those holding fellowships\r\nmade it possible for the association to establish, three years ago, a\r\nCouncil to Accredit Women for Advanced Work in Foreign Universities.\r\nAny woman applicant, college graduate or otherwise, found qualified in\r\nwork, character and serious purpose, receives a certificate properly\r\nsigned and attested which will secure for her, if possible to any\r\nwoman, the courtesy and privileges desired at a foreign university.\r\n\r\nThe organization contributes to the support of the Association for\r\nMaintaining the American Woman's Table at the Zoological Station at\r\nNaples and to that for Promoting Scientific Research by Women. The\r\nlatter pays $500 annually for the support of the Woman's Table, and to\r\npromote research has just offered a prize of $1,000, which offer, it\r\nis expected, will be renewed biennially.\r\n\r\nThe A. C. A. Committee on Corporate Membership maintains a high\r\nstandard of colleges whose graduates are admitted to this\r\norganization, which has done much in a quiet way to raise the\r\nstandards of department work, equipment and endowment of American\r\ncolleges admitting women.\r\n\r\nFor the past three years the association has published a magazine\r\ncontaining the addresses and reports given at its annual meetings.\r\nAmong its other publications are statistics relative to the Health of\r\nCollege Women (1885); a Bibliography of the Higher Education of Women\r\n(1897); a full descriptive list of the fellowships for graduate study\r\nopen to women in this country, together with a list of the\r\nundergraduate scholarships offered to women in the nineteen colleges\r\nbelonging to the A. C. A. (1899). It will soon issue studies of the\r\ngrowth and development of colleges, a supplement to the Bibliography\r\nof the Higher Education of Women, a study of the child from the point\r\nof view of parents and teachers, and a comprehensive statistical\r\ninvestigation into the health, occupations and marriage-rate of\r\ncollege and non-college women.\r\n\r\nThe work of the national association is carried on largely by standing\r\ncommittees which are under the leadership of the women most notable in\r\neducation--college presidents, deans and professors. Meanwhile, the\r\npresident, six vice-presidents and presidents of the various branches,\r\nacting through a salaried secretary-treasurer, give coherency and\r\nsupport to the development of its various objects. In addition, each\r\nbranch has committees which deal with local issues, such as public\r\nschool work of all kinds, home economics, development of children,\r\ncivil service reform, college settlements, etc. The investigation of\r\nthe sanitary conditions of the Boston public schools, 1895-1896,\r\nstarted the wave of schoolhouse cleaning which has swept across the\r\ncountry and which has not stopped at schoolhouses but has included\r\nschool boards and systems of school administration. The Chicago branch\r\nhas just issued a summary of laws relating to compulsory education and\r\nchild-labor in the United States, which shows the inadequacy of the\r\nfirst (except in three States) and the lack of correlation between the\r\ntwo which makes for lawlessness and crime. It is hoped that this\r\nsummary will serve as a basis for agitation which shall not cease\r\nuntil compulsory education becomes a fact and not a theory.\r\n\r\nThe association has twenty-five branches and 3,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ASSOCIATION FOR THE ADVANCEMENT OF WOMEN was organized in New York\r\nin October, 1873, at the very beginning of the club movement, to\r\ninterest the women of the country in matters of high thought and in\r\nall undertakings found to be useful to society, and to promote their\r\nefficiency in these through sympathetic acquaintance and co-operation.\r\nIt had a number of distinguished presidents and held congresses in\r\nmany States, which almost invariably led to the formation of local\r\nclubs for study and mutual improvement, as well as to good works in\r\nother lines. Among the cities in which a congress was held were New\r\nYork, Syracuse, Buffalo, Cleveland, Detroit, Chicago, Des Moines,\r\nDenver, Madison, St. Paul, Toronto, Baltimore, Memphis, Knoxville,\r\nLouisville, Atlanta and New Orleans. Many distinguished women were\r\nincluded in its membership and it had a strong influence in rendering\r\npossible the extensive formation of the women's clubs which are now so\r\nimportant a feature in American society. Its work is partly chronicled\r\nin two large volumes which give the papers presented and action taken\r\nat the meetings. The many great organizations of women in recent years\r\nhave made further work on the part of the association unnecessary.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GENERAL FEDERATION OF WOMEN'S CLUBS was organized March 20, 1890,\r\nto bring into communication the various women's clubs in order that\r\nthey may compare methods and become mutually helpful. The work is\r\naccomplished through three committees--Art, Education and Industries.\r\nThose on Art have used their influence toward its study and its\r\napplication to the home, and also for the quickening of enthusiasm in\r\nhorticulture and gardening, from which has developed the beautifying\r\nof public squares and school yards. In Education some of the most\r\nimportant results are the establishment of hundreds of traveling\r\nlibraries, assistance in organizing and fostering kindergartens,\r\nencouragement of manual training in the public schools, and the\r\nformation of Mothers' Clubs for the study of child culture. The\r\nfederation has worked with other organizations for the appointment of\r\nwomen on school boards and legislation for broader educational\r\nadvantages for women. In fact, its work has ranged from kindergarten\r\nto university.\r\n\r\nThe Industrial Committee studies conditions surrounding wage-earning\r\nwomen and children and encourages co-operation between the woman of\r\nleisure and the one who is self-supporting, and the organization of\r\nlaboring women in unions and clubs. One principal object is to\r\neliminate the child from the factory and then to educate it. The Civic\r\nwork has ranged from Health Protective Associations in cities to\r\nVillage Improvement Societies.\r\n\r\nThere are thirty-six State Federations, eleven foreign clubs and\r\nnearly 700 individual clubs belonging to the federation, representing\r\nover 200,000 members (1900).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL ASSOCIATION OF COLORED WOMEN was organized July, 1896, to\r\narouse all women, especially colored women, to a sense of their\r\nresponsibility, both in molding the life of the home and in shaping\r\nthe principles of the nation; to secure the co-operation of all women\r\nin whatever is undertaken in the interest of justice, purity and\r\nliberty; to inspire in all women, but especially in colored women, a\r\ndesire to be useful in whatever field of labor they can work to the\r\nbest advantage.\r\n\r\nKindergartens and day nurseries for the infants of working women have\r\nbeen established; mothers' meetings have been generally held and\r\nsewing classes formed; a sanitarium with a training school for nurses\r\nhas been founded in New Orleans; ground purchased on which an Old\r\nFolks' Home is to be built in Memphis, and charity dispensed in\r\nvarious ways. Women on plantations in the \"black belt\" of Alabama have\r\nbeen taught how to make their huts decent and habitable with the small\r\nmeans at their command, and how to care for themselves and their\r\nfamilies in accordance with the rules of health. Schools of Domestic\r\nScience are conducted, and a large branch is that of Business Women's\r\nClubs. The Convict Lease System, \"Jim Crow\" Car Laws, Lynching and\r\nother barbarities are thoroughly discussed, in the hope that some\r\nremedy for these evils may be discovered. Statistics concerning the\r\nprogress and achievements of colored people are being gathered.\r\nMusical clubs are formed to develop this inherent gift. An organ is\r\npublished called _Notes_, edited by Mrs. Booker T. Washington and an\r\nassistant in each State.\r\n\r\nThe association has 125 branches in twenty-six States and over 8,000\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL CONGRESS OF MOTHERS held its first public convention at\r\nWashington in February, 1897, and permanent organization was effected\r\nthere in 1898. Its objects are to raise the standards of home life; to\r\ngive young women opportunities to learn how to care for children; to\r\nbring into closer relations the home and the school; to surround the\r\nchildhood of the whole world with that wise, loving care in the\r\nimpressionable years of life which will develop good citizens.\r\n\r\nPractical efforts have been made to accomplish all of these objects.\r\nMothers have used their influence in behalf of free kindergartens in\r\nthe public schools; in having school buildings properly constructed,\r\nlighted, heated and ventilated, and for shorter hours in school and\r\nless study outside. They have lent their efforts to the uplifting of\r\nthe drama, since, rightfully used, it can be made a powerful\r\neducational factor, and have worked for a pure press, recognizing that\r\nit is the greatest material power in the world today. They have\r\nregarded their children first of all as future mothers and fathers,\r\nnext as citizens, and they are demanding that public educational\r\nsystems adopt their standards of values in the adjustment of\r\ncurricula.\r\n\r\nThey have established Mothers' Clubs in many communities, especially\r\namong women whose opportunities for training of any kind have been\r\nmeager; have seen that creches and free kindergartens are provided for\r\nthe children of the poor; that reading rooms are open for the use of\r\nboys and girls; have urged that women should serve upon all school\r\nboards and those of all prisons and reformatory institutions; have\r\ntaken the city fathers to task wherever laws pertaining to the\r\ncleanliness and health of a community are not enforced; have called\r\nmass meetings once a month to discuss questions pertaining to the\r\nwelfare of the child; by precept and example have set forth the\r\nadvantages of simplicity of dress and entertainment, and have\r\ninterested themselves in all kinds of humane work.\r\n\r\nState Congresses have been formed in nine States, exact membership not\r\nknown. Mrs. Theodore W. Birney was the founder of the organization and\r\nhas been its president continuously.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL WOMAN'S RELIEF SOCIETY was organized March 17, 1842, at\r\nNauvoo, Ills., being almost the oldest woman's society in existence.\r\nIt became national in 1868 and was incorporated in 1892, to assist the\r\nneedy, and to care for the afflicted, to lift up the fallen, to\r\nameliorate the condition of suffering humanity, to encourage habits of\r\nindustry and economy; to give special attention to those who have not\r\nhad proper training for life, to sacredly care for the dying and the\r\ndead, to minister to the lonely, however lowly, in the spirit of grace\r\nand heavenly charity.\r\n\r\nIt has been a veritable school of instruction to thousands of women,\r\nand its organization is so perfect that it is comparatively easy to\r\ncarry out any plan of work formed by the General Board. Donations are\r\nalmost entirely by the members themselves, and they have working\r\nmeetings, bazars and fairs occasionally to raise means for the needful\r\npurposes. Many of the branches have built houses for meetings and some\r\nalso own houses for their poor instead of paying rent. Industries have\r\nbeen carried on to supply work to such as were able to do something\r\nfor their own support. Of these the most notable is the silk industry\r\nin Utah. Over 100,000 bushels of wheat have been stored in granaries\r\nagainst a day of famine or scarcity. Hundreds of nurses and many\r\nmidwives have been trained under the fostering care of the society. At\r\npresent money is being raised by donation to erect a commodious\r\nbuilding in Salt Lake City opposite the Temple, suitable for\r\nheadquarters.\r\n\r\nThe society has 659 branches and 30,000 members in this and other\r\ncountries and upon the islands of the sea. Mrs. Eliza R. Snow and Mrs.\r\nZina D. H. Young have been the only two presidents.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL SUNSHINE SOCIETY had its origin in the early\r\nnineties in a department edited by Mrs. Cynthia Westover Alden in the\r\nNew York _Recorder_, which she afterwards carried into the _Tribune_.\r\nIt was first called the Shut-In Society, but the present name was\r\nadopted in 1896 and it was incorporated in 1900.\r\n\r\nIts object is to incite its members to the performance of helpful\r\ndeeds, and to thus bring happiness into the greatest possible number\r\nof hearts and homes. The membership fee consists of some act or\r\nsuggestion that will carry sunshine where it is needed. This may be\r\nthe exchange of books, pictures, etc., loaning or giving useful\r\narticles, suggesting ideas for work that can be done by a \"shut-in\"\r\nand sending the materials for it, making holiday suggestions and a\r\ngeneral exchange of helpful ideas.\r\n\r\nThere are many Sunshine libraries, some of them traveling, all over\r\nthe United States and Canada. In Memphis there is a Sunshine Home for\r\nAged Men, a Newsboys' Club House and a Lunch Room for Working Girls.\r\nSeveral branches have Sunshine wards in hospitals. The leading women's\r\nclubs have Sunshine Committees, and hundreds of churches have them in\r\ntheir King's Daughters' and Christian Endeavor Societies. Among the\r\nthousands of articles which have been placed where they will do the\r\nmost good are pianos, sewing machines, invalid chairs, baby carriages,\r\nfurniture and clothing of every description.\r\n\r\nThere are more than 100,000 members and over 2,000 well-organized\r\nbranches. The society is officered and managed by women and they\r\ncompose the immense majority of the members. Mrs. Alden has been the\r\npresident continuously.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL COUNCIL OF JEWISH WOMEN was organized in Chicago in 1893,\r\nas a result of the Congress of Jewish Women, which was a branch of the\r\nParliament of Religions held during the Columbian Exposition. Its\r\nobjects are to bring about closer relations among Jewish women and a\r\nmeans of prosecuting work of common interest; to further united\r\nefforts in behalf of Judaism through a better knowledge of the Bible,\r\nJewish literature and conditions. It has given much attention to\r\nsocial reform through preventive philanthropy and it affiliates with\r\nmany organizations of women interested in the public welfare. The\r\nCouncil conducts manual training and industrial schools, sewing and\r\nhousehold schools, kitchen gardens, kindergartens, mothers' clubs,\r\nboys' clubs, circulating libraries, reading rooms, free baths,\r\nemployment bureaus, milk and ice depots for the poor, crippled\r\nchildren's classes and many other philanthropies.\r\n\r\nDuring the Spanish-American War the Council contributed about $10,000\r\nin money and goods, and in several cities was the first organization\r\nto undertake this relief work. It has sixty-three sections in various\r\nStates and 6,000 members. Mrs. Hannah G. Solomon has been president\r\ncontinuously.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMEN'S NATIONAL INDIAN ASSOCIATION was organized in March, 1879,\r\nfor the civilization, education, enfranchisement and Christianization\r\nof the native Indians of the United States; the first society devoted\r\nexclusively to Indian advancement, to ask and labor for all these; to\r\ndemand from the Government lands in severalty, citizenship, industrial\r\nteaching and education for the aborigines (1881), and these were\r\ngranted in the passage of the Dawes Severalty Bill in February, 1887.\r\n\r\nBesides its important work politically, beginning a movement which has\r\ngained 60,000 Indian citizens, at least 25,000 of whom pay taxes and\r\n10,000 of whom voted at the last elections, it has opened directly or\r\nindirectly Christian, educational and industrial instruction at\r\nforty-seven stations, or in as many tribes; has builded many Indian\r\nhomes, starting civilized industries in these and in tribes,\r\nfurnishing agricultural implements, sewing machines, looms, stock,\r\netc., from a loan fund of $12,000. It has various other departments of\r\nhelp for red men--schools, libraries, temperance teaching, etc.--and\r\nhas expended in all these (besides sending missionary boxes of\r\nsupplies for the aged and helpless into seventy tribes) from $15,000\r\nto $28,000 annually. It has now a House of Industries where women and\r\ngirls are taught sewing, knitting, weaving, etc. Altogether forty-one\r\nbuildings have been erected.\r\n\r\nThe Association has nearly 100 branches in between thirty and forty\r\nStates and Territories and has several thousand members. Mrs. Amelia\r\nStone Quinton was general secretary from the beginning for eight\r\nyears, and has since been president continuously.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL LEAGUE OF WOMEN WORKERS was organized April 29, 1897, in\r\nthe interest of working women and their clubs. It is intended that the\r\nLeague shall stand as a central bureau of information, offering\r\ncounsel and help when sought, but not placing restrictions upon any\r\nclub. It has issued various publications, a monthly magazine, _The\r\nClub Worker_, a collection of songs, one of practical talks, another\r\nof plays and of entertainments; also a pamphlet entitled How to Start\r\na Club. It has made a collection of all publications issued by the\r\nvarious auxiliary State associations and clubs, which are distributed\r\nfree of charge to members. Between 8,000 and 9,000 publications are\r\nannually sold and distributed. The secretary each year visits from\r\nfifty to one hundred clubs to acquaint them with the work of other\r\nsimilar organizations. The League has collected data relating to the\r\nmanagement of lunch clubs, vacation houses and co-operative homes for\r\nworking women.\r\n\r\nIt is made up of five associations, and includes 100 clubs in Vermont,\r\nMassachusetts, Rhode Island, Connecticut, New York, Pennsylvania and\r\nMaryland, with a membership of over 8,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL CHRISTIAN LEAGUE FOR THE PROMOTION OF SOCIAL PURITY was\r\norganized in New York in October, 1885, and a national charter was\r\nobtained in 1889. Its object is to elevate opinion respecting the\r\nnature and claims of morality, with its equal obligation upon men and\r\nwomen, and to secure a practical recognition of its precepts on the\r\npart of the individual, the family and the nation; to organize the\r\nefforts of Christians in preventive, educational, reformatory and\r\nlegislative effort in the interest of Social Purity. It uses every\r\nrighteous means to free women and girls from financial dependence upon\r\nmen, not only by seeking to raise the status of domestic service, but\r\nby teaching the advantages of self-support in every kind of legitimate\r\nbusiness. During the past six years the League has secured employment\r\ndirectly for 3,300 applicants; it has supplied temporal and social\r\nbenefits to thousands of distressed women; furnished more than\r\n5,000,000 pages of literature helpful to all the people; prevented\r\nand stopped immoral shows and impure exhibitions; clothed the naked,\r\nfed the hungry and housed the shelterless.\r\n\r\nThe League has Hospital Auxiliaries, Social Culture Clubs, Industrial\r\nHomes with training for Italians and other foreigners; members in\r\nnearly every State and Territory--in Europe, China, Japan, India and\r\nSouth America. It was founded by Mrs. Elizabeth B. Grannis, who has\r\nbeen its president continuously.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE YOUNG LADIES' NATIONAL MUTUAL IMPROVEMENT ASSOCIATION was\r\norganized at Salt Lake City in June, 1869. Associations were formed in\r\ndifferent States, and these were gradually grouped into \"stake\" or\r\ncounty societies, each one presided over by a president and her board\r\nof workers. On June 19, 1880, an organization of these \"stakes\" was\r\neffected and a general president elected. The object is mutual\r\nimprovement for all, in spiritual, mental and physical conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is an educational association and has bettered the condition of\r\nthousands of girls, leading them toward the light, cultivating\r\nunselfishness, a love of humanity, and a desire to help the world; it\r\nhas given to all its members a deeper, truer, purer education than\r\nthey could otherwise have obtained. While not strictly a beneficiary\r\norganization, it disburses several thousand dollars a year. It owns\r\nconsiderable property, including houses and libraries.\r\n\r\nThe association has 507 branches and 22,000 members in ten States and\r\nTerritories and a number of foreign countries. Mrs. Elmina Shepard\r\nTaylor has been president since 1878.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL KINDERGARTEN UNION was organized in July, 1892, to unite\r\nkindergarten interests; to promote the establishment of kindergartens,\r\nand to elevate the standard of their training and teaching. It has\r\ninstituted more friendly relations between kindergartners, bringing\r\ntogether the conservative and radical elements upon a common platform.\r\nA broader conception of the principles of Froebel and their relation\r\nto education in general has been promoted, thus enlarging the scope of\r\nthe kindergarten idea and widening its influence. There are at present\r\nseventy branches with 6,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S PRISON ASSOCIATION AND ISAAC T. HOPPER HOME was organized\r\nby Mr. Hopper in 1845 in New York and incorporated in 1854. It was\r\nafterwards sustained for many years by his daughter, Mrs. Abby Hopper\r\nGibbons. Its object is the amelioration of the condition of women\r\nprisoners, the improvement of prison discipline and the government of\r\nprisons in respect to women; also the support and encouragement of\r\nwomen convicts after their release. The association has secured in New\r\nYork the searching of women prisoners by women; a law requiring police\r\nmatrons; one providing a Reformatory for Women and Girls, and others\r\nof like import. The Home is in a large measure self-supporting. From\r\nthis first organization a number of similar ones have been established\r\nand the condition of women prisoners has been much improved.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL HOUSEHOLD ECONOMIC ASSOCIATION was organized in March,\r\n1893, to promote a scientific knowledge of the care of children, and\r\nof the economic and hygienic value of food, fuel and clothing; to\r\ninculcate an intelligent knowledge of sanitary conditions in the home,\r\nand to urge the recognition of housekeeping as a business or trade\r\nwhich is worthy of highest thought and effort. This was the first\r\norganization to present Household Economics in a comprehensive form as\r\nan important and profound science. The existence of home departments\r\nin nearly every woman's club may be directly or indirectly traced to\r\nits influence. From Maine to California women have received from it\r\nbroader and better views of home and home life. It has vice-presidents\r\nin twenty-nine States.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL WOMAN'S KEELEY RESCUE LEAGUE was organized Sept. 18,\r\n1893, to restore the victim of inebriety and drugs to health and\r\nhappiness and to aid the unfortunate inebriate to become a\r\nself-supporting citizen instead of an object of charity; to visit the\r\nfamilies of inebriates and by every means possible aid them to a\r\nhigher and better life. It has brought sunshine and happiness into\r\nmore than one thousand desolate homes, and enabled the heads of these\r\nhomes to become self-supporting. Husbands and wives who have been\r\ndriven asunder by the curse of drink have been re-united. Thousands of\r\nchildren who would have been thrown upon the world or into charitable\r\ninstitutions have been saved and are now cared for in well-provided\r\nhomes. Many a family has been kept from becoming a charge upon\r\ncharity, and the current of many a human life has been turned in\r\nwholesome channels.\r\n\r\nThe League pays for a man's treatment at the time he enters a Keeley\r\nInstitute, taking his note (properly secured by the indorsement of\r\nsome friend, when possible), and requiring him to pay back in monthly\r\ninstallments or as his circumstances will permit. This creates a\r\nrevolving fund to be used over and over again. It has its friendly\r\nvisitors looking after the family while he is taking the treatment and\r\nendeavors to have employment for him upon his return. Men who have\r\nbeen sent to the work-house repeatedly have been permanently\r\nreclaimed. The League has eighteen branches and 650 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL FEDERATION OF MUSICAL CLUBS was organized January, 1898,\r\nto bring into communication the various musical societies that they\r\nmay compare methods of work and become mutually helpful; and to\r\narrange in different sections of the country Biennial Musical\r\nFestivals. It works for the musical life of the nation by creating a\r\nmusical atmosphere, studying composers and their works and bringing\r\nthe best talent in various lines to interpret and illustrate these\r\nstudies. Large, strong clubs have been helpful in sending their\r\nmembers to those smaller in numbers and weaker financially. Two\r\nMusical Festivals have been held, national in character, one in St.\r\nLouis in May, 1899, the other in Cleveland in May, 1901, with every\r\npossible artistic advantage of the highest talent.\r\n\r\nThere are branches in thirty-two States and Canada; 160 clubs are\r\nfederated with 12,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NEEDLEWORK GUILD OF AMERICA was organized April, 1885, to collect\r\nnew garments and distribute them to hospitals, homes and other\r\ncharities, and to extend its usefulness by the organization of\r\nbranches. It has distributed to hospitals, homes and other charities\r\nin the United States about 2,500,000 new garments. This includes the\r\nresults of two or three special collections for national disasters. It\r\nhas 308 branches in this country.\r\n\r\n\r\nRELIGIOUS:\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE METHODIST EPISCOPAL\r\nCHURCH was organized March 23, 1869. Its object is to engage and unite\r\nthe efforts of Christian women in sending missionaries to the women in\r\nforeign mission fields of the church and in supporting them and the\r\nnative Christian teachers, and all forms of work carried on by the\r\nsociety. It has collected and disbursed $5,454,700; sent to foreign\r\nfields 365 missionaries, and established a great educational work for\r\nwomen throughout the Orient. The first woman's college in Asia, at\r\nLucknow, India, was founded by this society. It sent the first fully\r\nequipped medical woman to the mission fields of the East, and built\r\nthe first hospitals for women in India, China and Korea. Nineteen\r\nhospitals and dispensaries are supported by the society, and 246\r\nmissionaries in Africa, Burmah, Bulgaria, China, India, Italy, Japan,\r\nKorea, Malaysia, Mexico, South America and the Philippines, while\r\ntwenty-four medical women are now in the field. There are 18,000 girls\r\nand women in its various schools.\r\n\r\nThe society has eleven branches, covering the whole United States,\r\n5,410 auxiliaries, and 171,765 members. Mrs. Cyrus D. Foss is\r\npresident.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S HOME MISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE M. E. CHURCH was organized\r\nJuly 10, 1880, to enlist and organize the efforts of Christian women\r\nin behalf of the needy and destitute women and children of all\r\nsections of the United States, without distinction of race, and to\r\nco-operate with the other societies and agencies of the church in\r\neducational and missionary work. The total receipts from July, 1880,\r\nto July, 1900, were $2,782,773; total value of property, $736,152.\r\nThis property consists of twenty industrial homes and schools, six\r\nmission homes, two immigrant homes, three children's homes, six\r\ncenters of city mission work, five deaconess and missionary training\r\nschools, twenty-eight deaconess homes, four rest homes for deaconesses\r\nand missionaries.\r\n\r\nThe Society has eighty-nine conferences, 2,500 auxiliary societies,\r\n59,000 adult members and 13,500 children. The Deaconess Department was\r\nestablished in 1888. There are now (1901) 1,160 deaconesses with\r\n$1,600,000 invested in real estate connected with their work. Mrs.\r\nClinton D. Fisk is president.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMEN'S FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE METHODIST PROTESTANT\r\nCHURCH was organized Feb. 14, 1879, to bring the heathen to Christ. It\r\nhas established schools, built churches and done a valuable work\r\nespecially among girls. It has twenty branches and about 3,000\r\nmembers. Mrs. F. A. Brown of Cardington, O., is serving her\r\ntwenty-first year as president.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S BAPTIST FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY was organized April 3,\r\n1871. The leading object is the Christianization of women in foreign\r\nlands by furnishing support through the American Baptist Missionary\r\nUnion to Christian women employed by said Union as missionaries,\r\nnative teachers or Bible readers, together with the facilities needed\r\nfor their work. Its missionaries have been sent to Burmah, Assam,\r\nIndia, China, Japan and Africa. The home constituency is found in the\r\nBaptist churches of the New England and Middle Atlantic States.\r\n\r\nThe total number of American missionaries supported for a longer or\r\nshorter time is 142. Of these seventy-eight are now connected with the\r\nsociety, 112 native Bible women employed as visitors in homes, and 367\r\nboarding and day schools with more than 14,000 pupils are maintained.\r\nMany women who have been taught in these schools are exerting a strong\r\ninfluence as Christian wives, mothers and teachers. The medical\r\nmissionaries have cared for souls and bodies alike. One of these\r\ndoctors reports 17,000 treatments at her dispensary during the last\r\nyear. Large sums of money have also been expended for mission work of\r\nvarious kinds under the care of the wives of missionaries. The total\r\namount raised and expended in thirty years is over $2,000,000.\r\n\r\nThere are numerous auxiliary circles, including about 34,000 women,\r\nbesides 10,000 younger women organized in guilds.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S BAPTIST FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY of the West was\r\norganized May 9, 1871, for the elevation and Christianization of the\r\nwomen of foreign lands by furnishing support to Christian women\r\nemployed as missionaries, to native teachers and to Bible women,\r\ntogether with the facilities needed for their work. It supports 177\r\nschools, 5,337 pupils, 159 teachers and 94 Bible women. In the medical\r\ndepartment it has two hospitals, two dispensaries, twenty medical\r\nstudents and three helpers; 597 patients were treated in the hospitals\r\nduring the past year and 6,130 outside patients. The amount raised\r\nsince organization is $885,279, and 105 missionaries have been sent\r\nout. There are 1,530 auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S BAPTIST HOME MISSION SOCIETY was organized Feb. 1, 1877,\r\nto aid in spreading the gospel and to Christianize homes by means of\r\nhouse-to-house visitation and by missions and schools with special\r\nreference to exceptional populations in the United States, and among\r\nneighboring countries. The missionary training school was organized\r\nSept. 5, 1881, and located at the headquarters of the society, now in\r\nChicago. The same year records the first issue of the monthly organ,\r\n_Tidings_, which has grown from a four-page circular to a\r\nthirty-two-page magazine, with a monthly circulation of 13,500 copies.\r\nThe training school has enrolled 518 students. The Society supports\r\nalso two training schools for negro workers--Shaw University, Raleigh,\r\nN. C., and the Caroline Bishop School in Dallas, Texas. It has\r\nemployed on its own fields 159 missionaries among foreign populations\r\nin this country from Europe, Indians, Negroes, Chinese, Syrians (from\r\nAsia), Mexicans, Cubans, Porto Ricans and Americans.\r\n\r\nThe missionaries report, for the year, besides work along many other\r\nlines, 80,635 visits in homes. During the twenty-four years the visits\r\nreported aggregate 1,152,950, and from the headquarters of the Society\r\nhave gone 6,478,544 pages of literature. The total cash receipts have\r\nbeen $1,034,104. Besides providing for its own distinctive work, the\r\nSociety has aided the American Baptist Home Missionary Society from\r\n1882 until 1901 to an extent represented by a total of $91,288.\r\n\r\nFigures have a certain value, but the best fruit is seen in the\r\nresults of the work of the missionaries on the fields, through the\r\nvisits in homes, women's meetings, children's meetings, industrial\r\nschools, parents' conferences, Bible bands, fireside schools, training\r\nclasses, and the circulation of pure, wholesome literature. Through\r\nthis womanly ministry uncounted lives have been transformed and a\r\nmultitude of abodes have become Christian homes. There are 2,807\r\nauxiliaries and about 60,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S AMERICAN BAPTIST HOME MISSION SOCIETY was organized Nov.\r\n14, 1878, for the evangelization of the women among the freed people,\r\nthe heathen, immigrants and the new settlements of the West, and for\r\nevangelizing and educating the women and children in any part of North\r\nAmerica. The amount raised during the last year was $38,000;\r\nfifty-seven teachers, missionaries and Bible women are supported among\r\ncolored people, Indians, Mexicans, Mormons, Chinese, Alaskans and\r\nFrench Catholics.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE FREE BAPTIST WOMAN'S MISSIONARY SOCIETY was organized June 12,\r\n1873, to conduct home and foreign missions. This is believed to be the\r\nonly Woman's Missionary Society (with possibly the exception of the\r\nChristian and the Friends') which from the beginning has been entirely\r\nindependent and not an auxiliary organization. It has furnished eleven\r\nwomen missionaries for India, one of whom is a professor in the\r\nTheological School and two are physicians, and supports a large number\r\nof schools, many native and Bible women and extensive zenana work.\r\nBesides this it aids all other women missionaries of its\r\ndenominational conference board by annual appropriations for their\r\nlocal work among women and children at the various stations occupied\r\nby Free Baptists. The Rhode Island Kindergarten Hall, the Widows' Home\r\nand the Sinclair Orphanage, all located at Benares, province of\r\nOrissa, India, are the property of this society.\r\n\r\nIts home missionary work is connected with Storer College, Harper's\r\nFerry, W. Va., to which it has furnished thirteen teachers, besides\r\ncontributing largely to the erection and equipment of two of the main\r\nbuildings. Its receipts have been about $200,000. It has a permanent\r\nfund of about $42,000.\r\n\r\nThe society has twenty-five State organizations, others in Canada and\r\nIndia, with between 8,000 and 9,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S PRESBYTERIAN BOARD OF FOREIGN MISSIONS OF THE SOUTHWEST\r\nwas organized at St. Louis in April, 1877; originally to create and\r\nfoster a practical and intelligent interest in the spiritual condition\r\nof women and children in our own land and in heathen lands. Since the\r\nclose of its fourteenth year its work has been for foreign missions\r\nonly, being one of the seven woman's auxiliaries to the Board of\r\nForeign Missions of the Presbyterian church in the United States of\r\nAmerica. It has given to the cause of missions $249,618, and has had\r\nmissionaries, as teachers or physicians, in India, China, Japan,\r\nKorea, Siam, Persia and South America. The record of their work has\r\nbeen of a nature sufficiently encouraging to warrant continued and\r\nlarger support. The Board has 605 branches or auxiliary societies and\r\n13,776 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S BOARD OF HOME MISSIONS OF THE PRESBYTERIAN CHURCH was\r\norganized in December, 1878, to establish and maintain Christian\r\nschools among those near home. It has eleven stations in Alaska,\r\neighteen among the Indians, twenty-seven among the Mexicans,\r\nthirty-one among the Mormons, forty among the mountaineers, six among\r\nthe foreigners in this country, five among the Porto Ricans, making a\r\ntotal of 138, with 425 missionaries and teachers and 9,337 pupils.\r\n\r\nThe Board has secured to the Presbyterian church $750,000 worth of\r\nproperty and has expended about $3,500,000 since organization. Two\r\nmagazines are published, the _Home Mission Monthly_, and _Over Sea and\r\nLand_ for the young, the latter jointly with the Foreign Societies. It\r\nhas about 5,000 auxiliary societies with about 100,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE CHRISTIAN WOMAN'S BOARD OF MISSIONS was organized Oct. 22, 1874,\r\nto maintain preachers and teachers for religious instruction; to\r\nencourage and cultivate a missionary spirit and effort in the\r\nchurches; to disseminate missionary intelligence and secure systematic\r\ncontributions for such purposes; to establish and maintain schools for\r\nthe education of both sexes.\r\n\r\nFields: The United States, Jamaica, India, Mexico and Porto Rico.\r\nWork: University Bible lectureships, Michigan, Virginia, Kansas,\r\nCalcutta, India; eighteen schools, four orphanage schools, two\r\nkindergartens, four orphanages with 500 children, one Chinese mission,\r\none hospital, three dispensaries, one leper mission, thirty mission\r\nstations outside the United States; 135 missionaries, besides native\r\nteachers, evangelists, Bible women and other helpers; $900,000 raised\r\nduring twenty-six years; income last year, $106,728. Its publications\r\nare _Missionary Tidings_, circulation 13,500; _Junior Builders_, same\r\ncirculation; leaflets, calendars, manuals, song books, etc. Property\r\nvalues: United States, $120,000; India, $60,300; Jamaica, $38,550;\r\nPorto Rico, $10,000; total, $229,650; amount of endowment funds,\r\n$85,000.\r\n\r\nThis is purely a woman's organization; funds are raised and disbursed,\r\nfields entered and work outlined and managed without connection with\r\nany \"parent board,\" although relations with other organizations of the\r\nchurch are most cordial. There are thirty-six State organizations,\r\n1,750 auxiliaries, forty-five young ladies' circles, 374 mission\r\nbands, 1,711 junior societies of Christian Endeavor, 177 intermediate\r\nsocieties and 40,000 members of auxiliaries.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S STATE HOME MISSIONARY ORGANIZATION OF THE CONGREGATIONAL\r\nCHURCH represents a slow but steady growth during the past thirty\r\nyears. Branches exist now in forty-two States and Territories. The\r\nlast report available, that of 1897, showed $100,768 collected that\r\nyear and disbursed for the usual home missionary purposes.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S CENTENARY ASSOCIATION OF THE UNIVERSALIST CHURCH was\r\norganized in 1869 to assist weak parishes, foster Sunday-schools, help\r\neducate women students for the ministry, endow professorships in\r\nschools and colleges, relieve the wants of sick or disabled preachers,\r\nministers' widows and orphans, distribute denominational literature,\r\nand do both home and foreign missionary work. Since its organization\r\nit has raised and disbursed over $300,000 and has a permanent fund of\r\n$20,500, the interest of which is annually expended for the purposes\r\nfor which the association was organized. Millions of pages of\r\ndenominational literature have been distributed. The association has\r\nten State societies and 100 mission (local) circles.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF UNITARIAN AND OTHER LIBERAL CHRISTIAN WOMEN\r\nwas organized in 1890. Its objects are primarily to quicken the\r\nreligious life of Unitarian churches and to bring the women into\r\ncloser acquaintance, co-operation and fellowship; to promote local\r\norganizations of women for missionary and denominational work and to\r\nbring the same into association; to collect and disseminate\r\ninformation regarding all matters of interest to the church, viz.:\r\nneeds of local societies, facilities for meeting them, work to be\r\ndone, collection and distribution of money, etc.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance takes part in the missionary work of the denomination,\r\nassisting small churches and starting new ones; supports one or more\r\nstudents each year at the Meadville Theological School and maintains\r\nseveral circuit ministers. It has lending and traveling libraries and\r\nlibraries for ministers, and has established and maintained three\r\npermanent ones in places where there was no free library. Through its\r\nwell-known Post Office Mission it distributes annually about 300,000\r\nsermons and tracts, and through its Cheerful Letter Exchange an untold\r\namount of miscellaneous literature. Money is not disbursed from a\r\ncentral treasury, but is given by the branches which are independent\r\nin such matters, an Executive Board making recommendations. The\r\nexpenditures of the past ten years have been $419,757. The Alliance\r\nhas 255 branches and nearly 11,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S MISSIONARY ASSOCIATION OF THE UNITED BRETHREN IN CHRIST\r\nwas organized Oct. 21, 1875, to engage and unite the efforts of women\r\nin sending missionaries into all the world; to support these and other\r\nlaborers in mission fields, and to secure by gift, bequest and\r\notherwise the funds necessary for these purposes. Valuable missionary\r\nwork is being done in West Africa, China and the Philippines. The\r\nassociation in the last twenty-five years has raised $311,920. It has\r\nforty branches and 13,232 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S FOREIGN UNION OF FRIENDS was organized May, 1890, to\r\nincrease the efficiency for spreading the Gospel of Christ among the\r\nheathen, and to create an additional bond between the women of the\r\nAmerican Yearly Meetings. It has been the instrumentality of greatly\r\nquickening the missionary zeal and activity in the denomination. It\r\nestablished missions in Japan, China, India and in unoccupied parts of\r\nMexico, and rendered valuable assistance in planting missions in\r\nAlaska, Jamaica and Palestine. It founded and has successfully managed\r\nthe _Friends' Missionary Advocate_. During the past ten years $300,000\r\nhave been raised and expended. It has ten branches and 4,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S HOME AND FOREIGN MISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE GENERAL SYNOD\r\nOF THE EVANGELICAL LUTHERAN CHURCH IN THE U. S. A. was organized in\r\n1879. Its object is to cultivate a missionary spirit, to create a\r\ndeeper interest in the spread of the Gospel, to disseminate missionary\r\nintelligence, and to engage and unite the efforts of Christian women\r\nin the Lutheran church in supporting missions and missionaries on home\r\nand foreign fields, in co-operation with the Boards of Home and\r\nForeign Missions and Church Extension. In the Foreign field it is now\r\nsupporting eight women missionaries in India, two of whom are\r\nphysicians and one a trained nurse. The principal station is Guntur,\r\nMadras Presidency. In Africa it is supporting two women missionaries\r\nat Muhlenberg, Liberia. In the Home field it has helped support\r\neighteen missions and build churches for twelve of them. The amount\r\ncontributed by the societies for the year ending March 31, 1902, was\r\n$27,286.\r\n\r\nThe Society has twenty-two Synodical Societies, 760 auxiliaries and\r\n20,452 members, active and honorary and cradle roll, besides 489 life\r\nmembers.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S MISSIONARY SOCIETY OF THE GENERAL SYNOD OF THE REFORMED\r\nCHURCH was organized in 1887, to aid in the advancement of the work of\r\nChristian Missions in Home and Foreign Lands. Individual societies had\r\nexisted for ten years previous. The last report available is that of\r\n1893, when 144 societies were reported and $10,000 collected during\r\nthe year. One-third was expended for foreign and two-thirds for home\r\nmissions. The society has published an official organ, the _Woman's\r\nJournal_, since 1894. Women also belong and contribute to the general\r\nmissionary societies of the church.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE INTERNATIONAL BOARD OF WOMEN'S AND YOUNG WOMEN'S CHRISTIAN\r\nASSOCIATIONS had its beginning in 1871, when thirty of these\r\nassociations affiliated for biennial conferences. Later they organized\r\nas the International Board which became incorporated. Its object is to\r\nunite in one central organization these bodies of the United States,\r\nCanada and other countries, and to promote the forming of similar\r\nones, to advance the mental, moral, temporal and above all the\r\nspiritual welfare of young women.\r\n\r\nThe Ladies' Christian Union of New York, organized in 1858, was the\r\nfirst work in this country for the welfare of young business women. A\r\nhome was the imperative need of the friendless young women employed in\r\ncities then as it is now, since the small wages received make possible\r\nfor them only the poorest quarters amid demoralizing conditions. These\r\nChristian Women opened a house and took into it as many as they could\r\nreach, giving clean rooms, wholesome food, cheap rent, pure moral\r\natmosphere and religious influences. From this developed the Young\r\nWomen's Christian Association.\r\n\r\nThe federated associations now own property valued at over $5,000,000.\r\nIn the evolution of this work the Boarding Homes, now accommodating\r\nover 3,000 at one time, have been supplemented as the need arose. The\r\nTraveler's Aid Department seeks to reach the young, ignorant girls\r\nbefore the agents of evil who haunt the railroad stations and steamer\r\nlandings. During 1900 over 10,000 were thus protected. The Employment\r\nBureau during this year assisted over 20,000 applicants. The\r\nEducational Department, with day and evening classes, has 15,000\r\nenrolled. There are Recreation Departments, Vacation Homes and many\r\nother important features. Every phase of the life of a girl or woman\r\nis touched by the association. Religion in its broad sense is its\r\nfundamental and guiding principle.\r\n\r\nTwenty-three States are represented in sixty associations in the\r\nUnited States and Canada, with over 20,000 voting and contributing\r\nmembers, over 500,000 associate members--self-supporting girls and\r\nwomen--and 2,500 junior members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S NATIONAL SABBATH ALLIANCE was organized in 1895, to\r\neducate the women of America to an intelligent appreciation of the\r\nrelation of this one day in seven to the national life, and to\r\nemphasize woman's responsibility and influence, especially in the home\r\nand in society. The work is along educational lines--in creating\r\npublic sentiment in favor of better Sabbath observance. While placing\r\na wedge in every tiny opening, its members have prayed, protested,\r\nproclaimed and practiced. Through this organization Christian women\r\nhave become more fearless in standing for their convictions. The\r\nAlliance has twenty-two branches and over 1,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nPATRIOTIC:\r\n\r\nTHE WOMAN'S RELIEF CORPS, AUXILIARY TO THE GRAND ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC,\r\nwas organized July 25, 1883. Its object is specially to aid and assist\r\nthe Grand Army of the Republic and to perpetuate the memory of its\r\nheroic dead; to assist such Union veterans as need help and\r\nprotection, and to extend needful aid to their widows and orphans; to\r\ncherish and emulate the deeds of army nurses and of all loyal women\r\nwho rendered loving service to the country in her hour of peril; to\r\nmaintain true allegiance to the United States of America; to inculcate\r\nlessons of patriotism and love of country among children and in the\r\ncommunities; to encourage the spread of universal liberty and equal\r\nrights to all.\r\n\r\nGeneral legislation is enacted by the annual national convention, the\r\nsupreme authority; States are governed by department conventions. The\r\nassociation has educated women in an exact system of reports and\r\nreturns. There are no \"benefits,\" as it is strictly philanthropic. It\r\nsupports a National Relief Corps Home for dependent army nurses and\r\nrelatives of veterans; has secured pension legislation from the\r\ngeneral Government for destitute army nurses; has influenced State\r\nlegislation in the founding of homes for Union veterans and their\r\ndependent ones in Colorado, Michigan, Illinois, Missouri, Wisconsin,\r\nIndiana, California, New York and Kansas; has led to the establishment\r\nof industrial education in the Ohio Orphans' Home; has been foremost\r\nin financial aid in every national calamity; has unitedly furthered\r\npatriotic teaching in schools and the flag in school rooms; and has\r\nraised and expended for relief in the eighteen years of its existence,\r\n$2,500,000. The corps has thirty-five departments, 3,174 subordinate\r\ncorps and 142,760 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nLADIES OF THE GRAND ARMY OF THE REPUBLIC were organized Jan. 12, 1886,\r\nto assist the G. A. R., encourage them in their noble work of charity,\r\nextend needful aid to members in sickness and distress and look after\r\nthe Soldiers' Homes and the Homes of Soldiers' Widows and Orphans; to\r\nobtain proper situations for the children when they leave the homes;\r\nto watch the schools and see that children are properly instructed in\r\nthe history of our country and in patriotism; to honor the memory of\r\nthose fallen and to perpetuate and keep forever sacred Memorial Day.\r\nIts departments and circles have spent for relief $16,685 and given to\r\nthe G. A. R. $2,658; to the Soldiers' Homes, $364; Soldiers' Widows'\r\nHomes, $1,461; Soldiers' Orphans' Homes, $179.\r\n\r\nThe organization has twenty-three departments and 28,070\r\nmembers--mothers, wives, daughters, sisters, granddaughters and nieces\r\nof soldiers and sailors who served honorably in the Civil War.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL ALLIANCE OF THE DAUGHTERS OF VETERANS OF THE U. S. A. was\r\norganized and chartered in 1885, to perpetuate the memories of the\r\nfathers and brothers, their loyalty to the Union and their unselfish\r\nsacrifices for its perpetuity; to aid them and their widows and\r\norphans, when helpless and in distress; to inculcate a love of\r\ncountry and patriotism among women; to promote equal rights and\r\nuniversal liberty, and to acquire, by donation or otherwise, all\r\nnecessary property and funds to carry out the aforesaid objects; to\r\nassist the G. A. R. to commemorate the deeds of their fallen comrades\r\non the 30th of May.\r\n\r\nThe Alliance is composed of daughters and granddaughters of the\r\nNorthern soldiers who fought in the Civil War, 1861-1865, and has a\r\nsufficient membership to assure the soldiers that their memory will\r\never be preserved and their widows and orphans will not want. Over\r\n$2,000 are spent yearly for relief. The value of donations other than\r\nmoney is nearly double that amount. It has assisted in obtaining\r\npensions, erected monuments for unknown dead, furnished rooms in\r\nSoldiers' and Soldiers' Widows' Homes, furnished transportation for\r\nhelpless soldiers, presented flags and banners, brightened sickrooms\r\nwith flowers and cheerful faces. At present it is interested in the\r\nerection of Lincoln Memorial University at Mason City, Ia., where one\r\nbuilding is to be known as the Daughters of Veterans' Building. There\r\nare \"tents\" scattered all over the Union and many State Departments.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MOUNT VERNON LADIES' ASSOCIATION OF THE UNION was organized in\r\n1853. Its purpose was the purchase and preservation of the home and\r\ntomb of General Washington with 200 acres of land. The sum of $200,000\r\nwas raised by voluntary contributions from the women of the United\r\nStates.\r\n\r\nThe Regent is elected by the Council and is a life officer. Mrs.\r\nJustine V. R. Townsend of New York is serving at present. The Regent\r\nappoints, and the council at its annual meeting ratifies by votes, one\r\nlady in each State as vice-regent to represent the State. The\r\nassociation is purely patriotic. The great annual increase of both\r\nhome and foreign visitors is gratifying, and testifies to the loving\r\nveneration in which the memory of Washington is held. The entrance fee\r\nof twenty-five cents is sufficient to keep the home and grounds in\r\nperfect colonial order.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL SOCIETY OF THE DAUGHTERS OF THE AMERICAN REVOLUTION was\r\norganized Aug. 9, 1890, to perpetuate the memory of the spirit of the\r\nmen and women who achieved American Independence, by the acquisition\r\nand protection of historic spots and the erection of monuments; by the\r\nencouragement of historical research in relation to the Revolution,\r\nand the publication of its results; by the preservation of documents\r\nand relics, and of the records of the individual services of\r\nRevolutionary soldiers and patriots, and by the promotion of\r\ncelebrations of all patriotic anniversaries; to carry out the\r\ninjunction of Washington in his farewell address to the American\r\npeople, \"to promote, as an object of primary importance, institutions\r\nfor the general diffusion of knowledge;\" to cherish, maintain and\r\nextend the institutions of American freedom, to foster true patriotism\r\nand love of country, and to aid in securing for mankind all the\r\nblessings of liberty.\r\n\r\nThe society has carried out its desired objects; brought together the\r\nwomen of the North and South; caused many of them to study the\r\nconstitution of their country and parliamentary law; rescued from\r\noblivion the memory of many heroic women of the Revolution; examined\r\nand certified to the 1,000 nurses sent by the Surgeon General's office\r\nto the Spanish-American War; raised $300,000 in money and sent 56,000\r\ngarments to the hospitals during that war; contributed $85,000 for a\r\nMemorial Hall in Washington, D. C. It has organized children's\r\nsocieties and taught them love for the flag and all it means; made\r\nforeign-born children realize what it is to be American citizens;\r\noffered medals and scholarships for historical essays by pupils in\r\nschools and colleges; helped erect the monuments to Lafayette and\r\nWashington in Paris. By requiring careful investigation of claims to\r\nmembership the society has caused many families to become re-united\r\nwho had been separated by immigration to remote parts of the country,\r\nand has stimulated a proper pride of birth--not descent from royalty\r\nand nobility but from men and women who did their duty in their\r\ngeneration and left their descendants the priceless heritage of pure\r\nhomes and honest government. The society has 600 chapters and over\r\n36,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SOCIETY OF THE DAUGHTERS OF THE REVOLUTION was organized Aug. 20,\r\n1891, to perpetuate the patriotic spirit of the men and women who\r\nachieved American independence; to commemorate prominent events\r\nconnected with the War of the Revolution; to collect, publish and\r\npreserve the rolls, records and historic documents relating to this\r\nperiod and to encourage the study of the country's history.\r\n\r\nThrough its State organizations it has marked with tablets historic\r\nplaces; promoted patriotism by gifts of historical pictures to public\r\nschools; helped to bring about an observance of Flag Day through the\r\ngeneral society; given prizes to various women's colleges for essays\r\non topics connected with the War of the Revolution; raised $5,000 to\r\nerect a monument at Valley Forge in memory of Washington's Army. The\r\npresent work is the establishment of a fund to be loaned in proper\r\nsums to girls trying to make their way through college. It has\r\nnineteen State societies and 3,200 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE COLONIAL DAMES OF AMERICA were organized in New York City, May 23,\r\n1890, to honor the brave men who in any important service contributed\r\nto the achievement of American independence; to collect manuscripts,\r\ntraditions and relics and to foster a true spirit of patriotism. A\r\nhereditary society was deemed the most effective for this purpose. It\r\nhas made a collection of valuable manuscripts, pedigrees, photographs\r\nand books; effected restorations in the old Swedes' Church at\r\nWilmington, placed tablets in Baltimore, to Washington, and in\r\nKingston, N. Y., to Governor Clinton. Historic tableaux have been\r\ngiven in the city of New York, with readings of original papers and\r\nlectures by historians. The publication of the \"Letters to Washington\"\r\nfrom the original manuscripts in the Department of State, has reached\r\nits fourth and last volume. For the sick and wounded in the\r\nSpanish-American War the society raised about $6,600, with a\r\ncontribution of hundreds of garments and hospital appliances, and\r\nseveral of its members worked in hospitals and camps.\r\n\r\nThe society also has its valued social side. It has five chapters in\r\nNew York, Philadelphia, Baltimore, Washington and Paris (France), with\r\nabout 400 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE NATIONAL SOCIETY OF UNITED STATES DAUGHTERS OF 1812 was organized\r\nJan. 8, 1892. Its object is to publish memoirs of famous women of the\r\nUnited States, especially those of the period included in the\r\neligibility of this society; to urge the Government, through an act of\r\nCongress, to compile and publish authentic records of men in military\r\nand naval service in the war of 1812, and of those in civil service\r\nduring the period embraced by this society; to secure and preserve\r\ndocuments of the events for which each State was famous during this\r\nperiod; to promote the erection of a home where the descendants of the\r\nbrave patriots of this war can be sheltered from the storms of life.\r\n\r\nThe work done in the various States is as follows: Two tablets, one\r\nmarking New York City defenses during the war and one for \"those who\r\nserved,\" in the Post Chapel at West Point; Michigan, a monument to\r\nGeneral McComb in the heart of Detroit; Maryland, the restoration of\r\nFort McHenry (the inspiration of The Star Spangled Banner); Louisiana,\r\na monument on the field of Cholnette. Massachusetts has received\r\npermission to restore the frigate Constitution and is raising $400,000\r\nfor this purpose; Pennsylvania is offering prizes in the public\r\nschools for historical work, and many other enterprises are under way.\r\nIt has nineteen State societies with a membership of 776.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE UNITED DAUGHTERS OF THE CONFEDERACY were organized Sept. 10, 1894.\r\nThe objects of the society are educational, memorial, literary and\r\nbenevolent; to collect and preserve material for a truthful history of\r\nthe War between the States; to honor the memory of those who fought\r\nand those who fell in the service of the Confederacy; to cherish the\r\nties of friendship among the members of the society and to fulfil the\r\nduties of sacred charity to the survivors of the war and those\r\ndependent upon them. Much aid has been given to aged and indigent\r\nConfederate soldiers. There are homes for these soldiers in every\r\nSouthern State and monuments have been erected to the Confederate dead\r\nin nearly every city. The orphans of Confederate soldiers have been\r\neducated and cared for, and in a number of States the society has seen\r\nthat correct and impartial histories are used in the public schools.\r\nIt has 500 branches and about 25,000 members.\r\n\r\n\r\nLODGES:\r\n\r\nTHE SUPREME HIVE LADIES OF THE MACCABEES OF THE WORLD was organized\r\nOct. 1, 1892, to extend the benefits of life protection to women; to\r\nunite fraternally the wives, mothers, daughters and sisters of the\r\nKnights of the Maccabees, as well as other women who are acceptable;\r\nto educate its members socially, morally and intellectually. Four\r\nhundred and twenty-five death claims were paid in 1900, amounting to\r\n$441,380; and twenty-two disability claims, amounting to $2,400. The\r\ntotal amount paid in claims from organization to Jan. 1, 1901, is\r\n$1,523,504.\r\n\r\nThe organization is composed of one supreme body, three subordinate\r\nbodies, known as Great Hives, and 1,835 subordinate or local hives,\r\nwith a membership of 84,657, of whom 19,321 are social and 65,336\r\nbenefit members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE SUPREME TEMPLE RATHBONE SISTERS OF THE WORLD was organized Oct.\r\n23, 1888, for promoting the moral, mental and social conditions of its\r\nmembers; cultivating a spirit of fraternal love which shall permeate\r\nand control their daily lives; ministering in all ways to the wants of\r\nthe sick and needy; watching at the bedside of the dying; paying the\r\nlast sad tribute of love and respect to the dead, comforting and\r\nproviding for the widow in her afflictions, and daily exemplifying in\r\nevery possible way the Golden Rule.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Temple has general supervision of the Order throughout the\r\nworld and makes the general laws. The Grand Temples, or State\r\norganizations, supervise the local Temples within their domain. The\r\nlatter, besides carrying out the principles peculiar to a fraternal\r\nsociety, select some special work for the good of those outside their\r\nranks. Reading rooms have been established, funds donated for public\r\nimprovements, charity, etc. In order to care for the orphans of\r\nRathbone Sisters a Home is soon to be erected, the fund being already\r\nset aside for this purpose. The local Temples care for their own poor\r\nand sick. In such disasters as those at Galveston and Jacksonville,\r\nthe Temples send liberal donations to their members to relieve their\r\nfinancial losses.\r\n\r\nThe Supreme Temple is composed of twenty-four State organizations and\r\n1,124 local Temples, with a membership of 71,247. Four insurance\r\nbranches have just been established (1900).\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE ORDER OF THE EASTERN STAR was organized in the latter part of the\r\neighteenth century--the exact date is not known. Its founders sought\r\nto create a social tie between the families of Masons, but it early\r\nreached a higher standard of usefulness. Among its objects are caring\r\nfor the widow and orphan and assisting the Masonic brother in all\r\ndeeds of mercy and love. It has founded Eastern Star Homes for widows\r\nand orphans of Masons and has become a mighty impetus in the building\r\nand support of Masonic Homes. Everywhere its members visit the sick,\r\nrelieve the distressed and speak words of cheer to the despairing. It\r\nhas been found helpful all over the land in carrying forward the\r\nunderlying principles of Masonry. It has taught woman to preside in\r\npublic meetings and to make herself conversant in parliamentary law.\r\nMasonry unites the heads of families, whereas the Eastern Star unites\r\nthe entire families. Its ritualistic teachings are designed to\r\ninculcate morals and to improve the social virtues. The Order\r\ncomprises 3,491 chapters with a membership of 218,238.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE DAUGHTERS OF REBEKAH were organized in 1851 as a side degree of\r\nthe Independent Order of Odd Fellows, and chartered lodges were\r\nauthorized in 1868. The object is benevolent work. The order stands\r\nvery high among charitable organizations and pays out thousands of\r\ndollars each year for the relief of widows and orphans. The report for\r\nthe present year shows that 6,212 families were assisted at an expense\r\nof $141,646; and $50,540 were paid for the education of orphans. The\r\nIndiana lodge erected a monument in Indianapolis to Vice-President of\r\nthe United States Schuyler Colfax, the principal founder of the order.\r\n\r\nThe Daughters of Rebekah usually exist wherever there is a lodge of\r\nthe I. O. O. F. Men may take the degree but the affairs of the lodges\r\nare entirely in the hands of women. There are 125,300 men and 200,850\r\nwomen members.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE GRAND INTERNATIONAL AUXILIARY TO THE BROTHERHOOD OF LOCOMOTIVE\r\nENGINEERS IN THE UNITED STATES, CANADA, AND MEXICO, was organized Oct.\r\n16, 1887, to elevate the social standing of railroad people, to\r\npromote a fraternal feeling between families of engineers and to\r\nrender assistance in time of trouble. The Voluntary Relief\r\nAssociation, formed in 1890, has paid to needy families of engineers\r\nover $100,000. It has no home for dependents, but helps widows to keep\r\na home and care for their own children. It secures homes for orphans\r\nand assists in their education out of a special standing fund. There\r\nare $15,000 in the general fund. The order is exclusively composed of\r\nwomen, who manufacture all supplies and from this source realize a\r\nconsiderable revenue. Study clubs for intellectual culture are\r\nmaintained in the various branches.\r\n\r\nThere are 255 subdivisions and about 10,000 members. It was founded by\r\nMrs. W. A. Murdock, who has served continuously as president.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE LADIES' AUXILIARY TO THE ORDER OF RAILROAD CONDUCTORS OF AMERICA\r\nwas organized in 1888. The idea originally was merely social, but so\r\nmany objects claimed assistance that, in 1895, the Fraternal\r\nBeneficiary Association was added to help the widows and children of\r\nrailway conductors. Assessments were levied and in five years $2,200\r\nhad been thus applied. Good speakers, parliamentarians and business\r\nwomen have been developed and its members have become broader and more\r\nenlightened in every direction. There are 156 local divisions, with a\r\nmembership of about 4,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nMISCELLANEOUS: Various organizations are in existence which are\r\nnational in their aims and interests but scarcely have reached\r\nnational proportions in the number of auxiliaries and membership.\r\nAmong these may be mentioned the SOCIOLOGICAL SOCIETY OF AMERICA,\r\norganized in New York in 1883, to disseminate the principles of Social\r\nand Industrial Co-operation; the NATIONAL WOMEN'S REPUBLICAN\r\nASSOCIATION, founded in 1888; the PRO RE NATA, started in Washington\r\nin 1889, to perfect its members in the art of extemporaneous speaking;\r\nWIMODAUGHSIS, organized in Washington in 1890 for the improvement of\r\nwomen along all educational lines; the ASSOCIATION OPPOSED TO THE\r\nFURTHER EXTENSION OF SUFFRAGE TO WOMEN; the NATIONAL FLORAL EMBLEM\r\nSOCIETY, formed at the Columbian Exposition in Chicago, 1893, to gain\r\nan expression from the people which shall lead to the adoption of a\r\nnational flower and also the selection of State flowers, which have\r\nbeen chosen in nineteen States and the choice ratified by the\r\nLegislature; the NATIONAL SOCIETY OF NEW ENGLAND WOMEN, founded in New\r\nYork in 1895, to promote acquaintance among New England women in\r\nvarious localities throughout the country for purposes of mutual\r\nhelpfulness; the NATIONAL LEAGUE OF AMERICAN PEN WOMEN, started in\r\nWashington City in 1896, to band together women journalists, authors\r\nand illustrators; the WOMEN'S PRESS ASSOCIATION, organized earlier and\r\nwith branches in various States; the GEORGE WASHINGTON MEMORIAL\r\nASSOCIATION, incorporated in 1898, to raise $250,000 toward an\r\nAdministration Building to be a part of the university as set forth in\r\nthe will of George Washington--$25,000 of this amount being now on\r\nhand and as much more guaranteed; the WOMAN'S LEAGUE OF THE GEORGE\r\nJUNIOR REPUBLIC, formed in 1899 to promote interest in the National\r\nRepublic and establish branches; the NATIONAL LEGISLATIVE LEAGUE,\r\nfounded in 1900 to obtain for women equality of legal, municipal and\r\nindustrial rights through action by the National Congress and the\r\nState Legislatures; WOMAN'S EDUCATIONAL AND INDUSTRIAL UNION; various\r\nassociations for improving cities and villages by means of parks,\r\nshade trees, good streets, sanitary appliances, etc.; and countless\r\nothers of a social, educational or philanthropic nature.\r\n\r\nThere are also a number of large national organizations composed of\r\nboth men and women, with the latter very greatly predominating. Of\r\nthese the most prominent are the UNIVERSAL PEACE UNION, founded in\r\n1866 and chartered in 1888, with forty branches in the United States\r\nand sixty in Europe; the SOCIETY FOR THE PREVENTION OF CRUELTY TO\r\nANIMALS; the NATIONAL CONSUMERS' LEAGUE; the CHRISTIAN ENDEAVOR\r\nSOCIETY; the EPWORTH LEAGUE; the YOUNG PEOPLE'S UNION; the KING'S\r\nDAUGHTERS AND SONS; the ANTI-VIVISECTION SOCIETY.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe above list shows that women are organized for carrying forward\r\npractically every department of the world's work, and that their\r\nassociations have been steadily increasing in number, size and scope\r\nduring the past half century. In the early years the Woman Suffrage\r\nAssociation not only stood alone in its advocacy of enfranchisement\r\nbut was regarded with the most strenuous disapproval by all other\r\norganizations of women. In 1881, the Woman's Christian Temperance\r\nUnion, principally through the influence of its president, Miss\r\nFrances E. Willard, established a department of franchise, but it was\r\nmany years afterwards before the idea of the ballot was received with\r\nfavor by any large number of its members. The sentiment is not now\r\nunanimous, but considered as a body there are no more active workers\r\nfor woman suffrage. The National Council of Women has no platform, but\r\nits leaders and also those of the International Council are prominent\r\nadvocates of the franchise. These are now found in greater or less\r\nnumbers in all the organizations but not one of them includes the\r\nsuffrage among the specific objects for which it works. As these\r\nbroaden the associations frequently find it necessary to appeal to\r\nLegislative bodies, and the result is usually a significant lesson in\r\nthe disadvantage of being without political influence. The Federation\r\nof Clubs, organized in 1890, in its endeavor to secure the passage of\r\nbills for various purposes, has applied to more Legislatures, during\r\nthe past few years, than has the Suffrage Association. It is indeed a\r\nmost interesting study to watch the evolution of the so-called women's\r\nclubs. Formed at first merely for a superficial literary culture, they\r\nwidened by degrees into a study of practical matters related to law\r\nand economics. From these it was but a step into civics, where they\r\nare to-day, struggling to improve municipal, and indirectly national\r\nconditions and gradually having revealed to them the narrow\r\nlimitations of woman's power in public affairs.\r\n\r\nWith the exception possibly of the church missionary societies and the\r\nvarious lodges, there is not one of these associations of women which\r\ndoes not depend in a greater or less measure on City Councils, State\r\nLegislatures or the National Congress for assistance in securing its\r\nobjects. No other means could be so effective in convincing women that\r\npolitics, which they have heretofore believed did not directly concern\r\nthem, in reality touches them at every point. They are learning that\r\nthe mere personal influence which usually was sufficient to gain their\r\nends in the household, society and the church--the three spheres of\r\naction to which they were confined in the past--must be supplemented\r\nby political influence now that they have entered the field of public\r\nwork. Women have been so long flattered by the power which they have\r\npossessed over men in social life that they are surprised and\r\nbewildered to discover that this is wholly ineffectual when brought to\r\nbear upon men in legislative assemblies. They find that it is not\r\nsufficient to have personal attractions or family position--not even\r\nto be a good wife, mother and worker in church and charities--they\r\nmust be also constituents. This is a new word which was not in the\r\nlexicon of woman in past generations. They investigate and they see\r\nthat whatever may be the private opinion of these legislators, their\r\npublic acts are governed by their constituents, and women alone of all\r\nclasses in the community are not constituents.\r\n\r\nThis knowledge could come to the average woman only through\r\nexperience, and that which as an individual she might not get in ages\r\nshe is gaining rapidly through organization. A summary of the\r\npreceding list shows about 2,000,000 women enrolled in the various\r\nassociations. The number which may be duplicated by a membership in\r\nseveral, is probably balanced by the number in those which do not\r\nstate the membership. This list includes only national associations\r\nand it is reasonable to assume that not more than one-half of the\r\nlocal societies are auxiliary to national bodies. This is known\r\npositively to be the case in the General Federation of Clubs, which\r\nincludes less than half of those in the different States. It would be\r\na decided underestimate to say that 4,000,000 women in the United\r\nStates are members of one or more organizations, and it is clearly\r\nevident that this number is increasing. The scope of these\r\nassociations is constantly broadening as women themselves are emerging\r\nfrom their narrow environment and seeing the needs of the world in\r\nwider perspective. They are slowly but certainly learning to devote\r\ntheir time and energy to larger objects, and they are awakening to a\r\nperception, above all else, of the strength that lies in combination,\r\na knowledge which was a sealed book to the isolated and undeveloped\r\nwomen of past generations. No other influence has been so powerful in\r\nenabling woman to discover herself and her possibilities.\r\n\r\nThere will be no more important element to be reckoned with during the\r\ncoming years of the new century than these great associations of\r\nwomen, constantly gaining strength and momentum, not alone by the\r\nincrease of membership but also by its personnel, for now they are\r\nbeginning to be composed of college graduates, of property owners, of\r\nwomen with business experience. More and more they are directing their\r\nattention to public questions, and when brains, wealth, executive\r\nability, enthusiasm and a strong desire for an honest and moral\r\ngovernment are thoroughly organized in the effort to obtain it, they\r\nmust necessarily become a powerful factor in State and national\r\naffairs, and one which inevitably will refuse to be held in a\r\ndisfranchised condition after it shall realize the supreme power which\r\ninheres in the suffrage.\r\n\r\nThere is still another and a more important point of view from which\r\nthis subject should be studied. Here are more than 4,000,000 women,\r\nabout one-third of all in the country, banded into active, working\r\norganizations. The figures given above show that they are raising and\r\nexpending millions of dollars and every dollar for some worthy object.\r\nThe list demonstrates beyond question that every one of these great\r\nassociations exists for the purpose of improving the conditions of\r\nsociety and helping and bettering humanity. They represent the highest\r\nform of effort for education, morality, temperance, religion, justice,\r\npatriotism and co-operation. Are not these the very qualities most\r\nneeded in our electorate? Is not the nation suffering because of the\r\nlack of them since it has placed the ballot in the hands of ignorance,\r\nimmorality, intemperance and lawlessness? Does not an emergency exist\r\nfor a political influence which shall counterbalance these and tip the\r\nscale the other way? Can the Government afford much longer to delay\r\nthe summons for this great, well-organized, finely-equipped force--if\r\nit is to perfect and make permanent the institutions of the\r\nrepublic?\r\n\r\n\r\nFOOTNOTES:\r\n\r\n[498] The National Suffrage Association is not included in the list,\r\nas twenty-one chapters of this volume are devoted to its work. It was\r\nthe intention to give the name of the president of each organization,\r\nbut as this officer is so frequently changed it seemed best to abandon\r\nthis plan save in special instances. The figures given are for 1900\r\nwith but few exceptions.\r\n\r\nThe church missionary societies not mentioned here, and some other\r\nnational bodies, were appealed to several times for statistics without\r\nresponse. The list, however, includes all of any considerable size and\r\nimportance. It did not seem that it would represent the true\r\nproportions of these associations if arranged alphabetically or\r\naccording to date of organization, therefore the editors have used\r\ntheir individual judgment in placing them.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nAPPENDIX\r\n\r\nEMINENT ADVOCATES OF WOMAN SUFFRAGE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe following list is so incomplete as to make the advisability of\r\nusing it a matter of grave doubt. No name is given except upon what is\r\nbelieved to be unimpeachable authority, but it is unavoidable that\r\nscores should be omitted which are entitled to a place. The list will\r\nindicate, however, the character of those who have espoused the cause\r\nof woman suffrage, and it is published with the request that readers\r\nwill forward to the editors additional names which can be used, and\r\nmention any which should be omitted, in the second edition of this\r\nvolume. There has been no attempt to give all in any profession, but\r\nonly a few of those who may fairly be considered representative. The\r\nnames, for instance, of clergymen alone who are in favor of the\r\nenfranchisement of women would fill many pages, while those of\r\nprominent lawyers in every community would require almost unlimited\r\nspace, as it is a question which appeals especially to the sense of\r\nequity. The following list will indicate sufficiently that this is not\r\na movement of ultra-radical and irresponsible extremists.\r\n\r\nThe only President of the United States who declared himself publicly\r\nand unequivocally for woman suffrage was Abraham Lincoln, who said as\r\nearly as 1836, \"I go for all sharing the privileges of the Government\r\nwho assist in bearing its burdens--by no means excluding women,\" and\r\nlater utterances indicated that he did not change his position.\r\nRutherford B. Hayes never hesitated to express his approval in private\r\nconversation, and in 1872 he assisted materially in placing in the\r\nRepublican National Platform the nearest approach to an indorsement\r\nwhich the movement ever has received from that party. James A.\r\nGarfield said: \"Laugh as we may, put it aside as a jest if we will,\r\nkeep it out of Congress and political campaigns, still the woman\r\nquestion is rising on our horizon larger than a man's hand; and some\r\nsolution ere long that question must find.\" Theodore Roosevelt, when a\r\nmember of the New York Legislature, voted for a woman suffrage bill,\r\nsaying he had been converted by seeing how much the women accomplished\r\nwith their school ballot at Oyster Bay, his home. When Governor he\r\nsaid in his message to the Legislature of 1899: \"I call your attention\r\nto the desirability of gradually enlarging the sphere in which the\r\nsuffrage can be extended to women.\" There is reason to believe other\r\nPresidents would have expressed themselves favorably had political\r\nexigencies permitted.\r\n\r\nThe only Vice-Presidents on record as advocating and voting for woman\r\nsuffrage are Hannibal Hamlin, Schuyler Colfax, Henry Wilson and\r\nWilliam A. Wheeler. Such action is likely to mean the personal loss of\r\nvotes and injury to one's party, with no compensation other than the\r\nconsciousness of having done right, as women can give no reward.\r\nUnder these conditions it is surprising that so large a number in the\r\nCongress and State Legislatures have sustained the measures for the\r\nenfranchisement of women.[499]\r\n\r\n  CHIEF JUSTICES OF THE U. S. SUPREME COURT.\r\n\r\n  Chase, Salmon P.\r\n  Wake, Morrison R.\r\n\r\nPractically all of the State Supreme Court Justices of Colorado,\r\nIdaho, Utah and Wyoming, where women have exercised the suffrage for a\r\nnumber of years, and of Kansas where they have had a municipal vote\r\nfor fifteen years, are strong advocates of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n  UNITED STATES SENATORS.\r\n\r\n  Allen, John B.

The small amount of\r\ncriticism which has been openly made has been anonymous or from those\r\nwhose word was entitled to no weight. There is not another public\r\nquestion on which the testimony is so uniformly one-sided, and similar\r\nevidence on any other would be accepted as sufficiently conclusive to\r\ndemand a unanimous verdict in its favor.\r\n\r\nIn 1901 Amos R. Wells, editor of the _Christian Endeavor World_, wrote\r\nto twenty-five ministers of several different denominations, choosing\r\ntheir names at random among his subscribers in the equal suffrage\r\nStates, and asking them whether equal suffrage was working well,\r\nfairly well or badly. One answered that it worked badly, three that it\r\nworked fairly well, and the twenty-one others were all positive and\r\nexplicit in saying that it worked well. One point upon which they laid\r\nstress was the increased intelligence and breadth of mind of the\r\nwomen, and the good influence of this upon their children. Mr. Wells\r\nsaid in summing up: \"Woman suffrage makes elections more expensive,\r\nbut it is a grand school for the mothers of the republic.\"\r\n\r\n\r\nCOLORADO.\r\n\r\nIn 1898, in answer to the continued misrepresentations of the Eastern\r\npress, the friends of woman suffrage issued the following:\r\n\r\n     We, citizens of the State of Colorado, desire, as lovers of truth\r\n     and justice, to give our testimony to the value of equal\r\n     suffrage. We believe that the greatest good of the home, the\r\n     State and the nation is advanced through the operation of equal\r\n     suffrage. The evils predicted have not come to pass. The benefits\r\n     claimed for it have been secured, or are in progress of\r\n     development. A very large proportion of Colorado women have\r\n     conscientiously accepted their responsibility as citizens. In\r\n     1894 more than half the total vote for Governor was cast by\r\n     women. Between 85 and 90 per cent. of the women of the State\r\n     voted at that time. The exact vote of the last election has not\r\n     yet been estimated, but there is reason to believe that the\r\n     proportional vote of women was as large as in previous years. The\r\n     vote of good women, like that of good men, is involved in the\r\n     evils resulting from the abuse of our present political system;\r\n     but the vote of women is noticeably more conscientious than that\r\n     of men, and will be an important factor in bringing about a\r\n     better order.\r\n\r\nThis was signed by the governor, three ex-governors, both senators,\r\nboth members of Congress and ex-senators, the chief justice and two\r\nassociate justices of the supreme court, three judges of the court of\r\nappeals, four judges of the district court, the secretary of State,\r\nthe State treasurer, State auditor, attorney-general, the mayor of\r\nDenver, the president of the State University, the president of\r\nColorado College, the representative of the General Federation of\r\nWomen's Clubs, the vice-regent of the Mount Vernon Association, and\r\nthe presidents of thirteen women's clubs.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI am confident that recognition of woman suffrage in the constitution\r\nof proposed States will not in any way hinder, delay or endanger their\r\nadmission. That question is one belonging to the State and not to the\r\ngeneral government, and the opponents of woman suffrage will not, I am\r\nsure, deny to the new States the right to settle that question for\r\nthemselves.\r\n\r\n               HENRY M. TELLER (Rep.), _U. S. Senator_. (1889.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nInstead of rough or vicious men, or even drunken men, treating women\r\nwith disrespect, the presence of a single good woman at the polls\r\nseems to make the whole crowd of men as respectful and quiet as at the\r\ntheater or church. For the credit of American men be it said that the\r\npresence of one woman or girl at the polls, the wife or daughter of\r\nthe humblest mechanic, has as good an effect on the crowd as the\r\npresence of the grandest dame or the most fashionable belle. The\r\nAmerican woman is clearly as much of a queen at the polls, in her own\r\nbearing and the deference paid her, as in the drawing-room or at the\r\nopera. I feel more pride than ever in American manhood and American\r\nwomanhood since seeing these gatherings on Tuesday, where men and\r\nwomen of all classes and conditions met in their own neighborhood to\r\nperform with duty and dignity the selection of their own rulers, and\r\nto give their approval to the principles to guide such officials when\r\nchosen. No woman was less in dignity and sweetness of womanhood after\r\nsuch participation in public duties, and I do not believe there is a\r\nman of sensibility in Colorado to-day who does not love his wife,\r\ndaughter, sister or mother the more for the womanly and gracious\r\nmanner in which she helped so loyally and intelligently in this\r\nelection.\r\n\r\nIndeed, Colorado in this election has left very little of good\r\nargument for its sincere opponents to urge against suffrage. So nearly\r\nall of everything having any good sense in it has been disproved here,\r\nthat the opposition is left with very few weapons in its armory, and\r\nall of them weak.\r\n\r\n               JAMES S. CLARKSON (Rep.),\r\n                              _U. S. Ass't P. M. General_. (1894.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWhen the question was submitted in Colorado, I supported and voted for\r\nthe proposition as a matter of abstract right; as every fair man must\r\nadmit, when the question comes to him, that a woman has the same right\r\nof suffrage as a man. In advocating suffrage you need no platform but\r\nright and justice; those who will not accept it upon that ground would\r\nnot be persuaded though one rose from the dead. I will add, however,\r\nthat even the most virulent enemy of woman suffrage can not prove that\r\nany harm has come from the experiment. The test in Colorado is still\r\ntoo new to expect a unanimous verdict, yet all fair-minded observers\r\nare justified in predicting a higher standard of morals and of\r\npolitical life as a result of woman suffrage.\r\n\r\n               ALVA ADAMS (Dem.), _Governor_. (1898.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nI supported the cause of woman suffrage, not because I thought it\r\nwould work the political regeneration of the country, but because I\r\nbelieved it was a woman's due to vote, if she desired to do so. I have\r\nalso said, and I reiterate, that the enfranchisement of Colorado women\r\nhas in many ways benefited the State, that it was a decided advance,\r\nand that I trusted that other States, in emulation of our example,\r\nwould soon give the right to women throughout the land.\r\n\r\n               CHARLES S. THOMAS (Dem.), _Governor_. (1899.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThere is not a political party in the State that will ever dare to\r\ninsert in its platform an anti-suffrage plank; for it must not be\r\nforgotten that upon this question the voting power of the women would\r\nequal that of the men. It is no more likely that the women of Colorado\r\nwill ever be disfranchised than that the men will be.\r\n\r\n               HORACE M. HALE, _former President State University_. (1901.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nFew are so unjust or bold as to argue seriously against the abstract\r\nright of women to vote; and experience in Colorado and other Western\r\nStates has done much to dispel the various theoretical and sentimental\r\nobjections that have been raised against the extension of this\r\nmanifest right.\r\n\r\nThe largest majorities for woman suffrage were given in the most\r\nintelligent cities, and in the best precincts of each city, while the\r\nheavy majorities against it were in the precincts controlled by the\r\ndebased and lawless classes, and the lowest grade of machine\r\npoliticians, who rely on herding the depraved vote--showing that these\r\nelements dreaded the effect of woman suffrage, and realized the\r\nfalsity of the argument that it would increase the immoral and\r\ncontrollable vote.\r\n\r\nSo far as I have been able to judge by observation of elections and\r\nanalysis of returns, more women vote in the better districts than in\r\nthe slums, and the proportion of intelligent and refined voters to the\r\nignorant and depraved is larger among women than among men. The\r\naverage result, therefore, has been beneficial.\r\n\r\nNo true, refined woman is any less womanly for studying questions of\r\npublic interest and expressing her opinions thereon by means of the\r\nballot.... The general effect has been decidedly beneficial.\r\nEspecially does it act as a governor on the political machines of all\r\nparties to regulate the character of nominees and platforms.\r\n\r\nWoman suffrage is accepted as an established fact, and is very little\r\ndiscussed. I certainly have no reason to think that the general\r\nsentiment in its favor has decreased, or that the measure would fail\r\nto pass with as large or a larger majority than before, if again\r\nsubmitted to the vote of either the men or women of the State. I have\r\nno hesitation whatever in stating as my own positive conviction that\r\nwoman suffrage is both right and beneficial, and that it should not\r\nand never will be repealed in Colorado.\r\n\r\nIRVING HALE (of Col.), _General in the Army of the Philippines_.\r\n(1902.)\r\n\r\nIt is said that equal suffrage would make family discord. In Colorado\r\nour divorce laws are rather easy, though stricter than in the\r\nneighboring States, but since 1893, when suffrage was granted, I have\r\nnever heard of a case where political differences were alleged as a\r\ncause for divorce or as the provoking cause of family discord. Equal\r\nsuffrage, in my judgment, broadens the minds of both men and women. It\r\nhas certainly given us in Colorado candidates of better character and\r\na higher class of officials. It is very true that husband and wife\r\nfrequently vote alike--as the magnet draws the needle they go to the\r\npolls together. But women are not coerced. If a man were known to\r\ncoerce his wife's vote I believe he would be ridden out of town on a\r\nrail with a coat of tar and feathers. Women's legal rights have been\r\nimproved in Colorado since they obtained the ballot, and there are now\r\nno civil distinctions. Equal suffrage tends to make political affairs\r\nbetter, purer and more desirable for all who take part in them.\r\n\r\n               THOMAS M. PATTERSON (Dem.), _U. S. Senator_. (1902.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nIDAHO.\r\n\r\nIt gives me pleasure to say briefly that the extension of the\r\nfranchise to the women of Idaho has positively purified its politics.\r\nIt has compelled not only State conventions, but, more particularly,\r\ncounty conventions, of both parties, to select the cleanest and best\r\nmaterial for public office. Many conventions have turned down their\r\nstrongest local politicians for the simple reason that their moral\r\nhabits were such that the women would unite against them, regardless\r\nof politics. It has also taken politics out of the saloon to a great\r\nextent, and has elevated local politics especially to a higher plane.\r\nEvery woman is interested in good government, in good officers, in the\r\nutmost economy of administration, and a low rate of taxation.\r\n\r\n               FRANK W. HUNT (Dem.), _Governor_. (1900.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nWoman suffrage has been in operation in Idaho for over four years and\r\nthere have been no alarming or disastrous results. I think most people\r\nin the State, looking over the past objections to the extension of the\r\nright of suffrage, are now somewhat surprised that any were ever made.\r\nAs to advantages--it is, as in all matters of this kind, difficult to\r\nmeasure them exactly, because the benefit is largely indirect. I\r\nthink, however, that it has exercised a good and considerable\r\ninfluence over conventions, resulting in the nomination of better men\r\nfor office, and that it has been of considerable weight in securing\r\nthe enactment of good laws.\r\n\r\n               S. H. HAYS (Fus.), _Ex-Attorney-General_. (1901.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe adoption of equal suffrage has resulted in much good in Idaho. The\r\nsystem is working well, and the best result therefrom is the selection\r\nfor public positions, State, county and municipal. Our politics in the\r\npast has been manipulated by political adventurers, more or less,\r\nwithout regard to the best interests of the people, but principally in\r\nthe interests of a small coterie of politicians of the different\r\nparties, who have depended upon the public treasury for subsistence.\r\nThe participation of our women in the conventions of our various\r\npolitical parties and in elections has a tendency to relegate the\r\nprofessional politicians, at least the worst element, and bring forth\r\nin their stead a better class of people. This tendency is of vast\r\nimportance to the State. It compels leaders of political parties to be\r\nmore careful in the selection of candidates for different offices of\r\ntrust and profit. RALPH P. QUARLES, _Justice of the Supreme Court_.\r\n(1902.)\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\nThe Chief Justice and all the Judges of the Supreme Court have\r\npublished a statement saying in part: \"Woman suffrage in this State is\r\na success; none of the evils predicted have come to pass, and it has\r\ngained much in popularity since its adoption by our people.\"\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nUTAH.\r\n\r\nThe lawmakers seem to be afraid of enfranchising women because of the\r\ndeteriorating effect which politics might have on womankind. If this\r\nbe true let the experience of Utah speak. For six years women in this\r\nState have had the right to vote and hold office. Have the wheels of\r\nprogress stopped? Instead we have bounded forward with seven-league\r\nboots. Have the fears and predictions of the local opponents of woman\r\nsuffrage been verified? Have women degenerated into low politicians,\r\nneglecting their homes and stifling the noblest emotions of womanhood?\r\nOn the contrary women are respected quite as much as they were before\r\nStatehood; loved as rapturously as ever, and are led to the altar with\r\nthe same beatific strains of music and the same unspeakable joy that\r\ninvested ceremonials before their enfranchisement.\r\n\r\nThe plain facts are that in this State the influence of woman in\r\npolitics has been distinctly elevating. In the primary, in the\r\nconvention and at the polls her very presence inspires respect for law\r\nand order. Few men are so base that they will not be gentlemen in the\r\npresence of ladies. Experience has shown that women have voted their\r\nintelligent convictions. They understand the questions at issue and\r\nthey vote conscientiously and fearlessly. While we do not claim to\r\nhave the purest politics in the world in Utah, it will be readily\r\nconceded that the woman-vote is a terror to evildoers, and our course\r\nis, therefore, upward and onward.\r\n\r\nOne of the bugaboos of the opposition was that women would be\r\ncompelled to sit on juries. Not a single instance of the kind has\r\nhappened in the State, for the reason that women are never summoned;\r\nthe law simply exempts them, but does not exclude them. Another\r\nfavorite idiocy of the anti-suffragists is that if the women vote they\r\nought to be compelled to fight. In the same manner the law exempts\r\nthem from military service.\r\n\r\nFor one I am proud of Utah's record in dealing with her female\r\ncitizens. I take the same pride in it that a good husband would who\r\nhad treated his wife well, and I look forward with eager hope to the\r\nday when woman suffrage shall become universal.\r\n\r\n               HEBER M. WELLS (Rep.), _Governor_. (1902.)\r\n\r\nThere is literally no end to the favorable testimony from Utah, given\r\nby Mormons and Gentiles alike.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWYOMING.\r\n\r\nGov. John A. Campbell was in office when the woman suffrage law was\r\npassed. In 1871 he said in his message to the Territorial Legislature:\r\n\r\n     There is upon our statute book \"an Act granting to the women of\r\n     Wyoming Territory the right of suffrage,\" which has now been in\r\n     force two years. It is simple justice to say that the women\r\n     entering, for the first time in the history of the country, upon\r\n     these new and untried duties, have conducted themselves in every\r\n     respect with as much tact, sound judgment, and good sense, as\r\n     men.\r\n\r\nIn 1873 he said: \"Two years more of observation of the practical\r\nworking of the system have only served to deepen my conviction that\r\nwhat we, in this Territory, have done, has been well done; and that\r\nour system of impartial suffrage is an unqualified success.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Thayer, who succeeded Campbell, said in his message:\r\n\r\n     Woman suffrage has now been in practical operation in our\r\n     Territory for six years, and has, during the time, increased in\r\n     popularity and in the confidence of the people. In my judgment\r\n     the results have been beneficial, and its influence favorable to\r\n     the best interests of the community.\r\n\r\nGovernor Hoyt, who succeeded Thayer, said in 1882:\r\n\r\n     Under woman suffrage we have better laws, better officers, better\r\n     institutions, better morals, and a higher social condition in\r\n     general, than could otherwise exist. Not one of the predicted\r\n     evils, such as loss of native delicacy and disturbance of home\r\n     relations, has followed in its train.\r\n\r\nLater he said in a public address: \"The great body of our women, and\r\nthe best of them, have accepted the elective franchise as a precious\r\nboon and exercise it as a patriotic duty--in a word, after many years\r\nof happy experience, woman suffrage is so thoroughly rooted and\r\nestablished in the minds and hearts of the people that, among them\r\nall, no voice is ever uplifted in protest against or in question of\r\nit.\"\r\n\r\nGovernor Hale, who was next in this office, expressed himself\r\nrepeatedly to the same effect.\r\n\r\nGovernor Warren, who succeeded Hale, said in a letter to Horace G.\r\nWadlin, Esq., of the Massachusetts House of Representatives, in 1885:\r\n\r\n     Our women consider much more carefully than our men the character\r\n     of candidates, and both political parties have found themselves\r\n     obliged to nominate their best men in order to obtain the support\r\n     of the women. As a business man, as a city, county, and\r\n     territorial officer, and now as Governor of Wyoming Territory, I\r\n     have seen much of the workings of woman suffrage, but I have yet\r\n     to hear of the first case of domestic discord growing out of it.\r\n     Our women nearly all vote, and since in Wyoming as elsewhere the\r\n     majority of women are good and not bad, the result is good and\r\n     not evil.\r\n\r\nTerritorial Governors are appointed, not elected. As U. S. Senator,\r\nMr. Warren has up to the present time (1902) repeatedly given similar\r\ntestimony. In various chapters of the present volume may be found the\r\nstrong approval of ex-U. S. Senator Joseph M. Carey.\r\n\r\nMost of these Governors were Republicans. Hon. N. L. Andrews\r\n(Democrat), Speaker of the Wyoming House of Representatives, said in\r\n1879:\r\n\r\n     I came to this Territory in the fall of 1871, with the strongest\r\n     prejudice possible against woman suffrage. The more I have seen\r\n     of it, the less my objections have been realized, and the more it\r\n     has commended itself to my judgment and good opinion. Under all\r\n     my observations it has worked well, and has been productive of\r\n     much good. The women use the ballot with more independence and\r\n     discrimination in regard to the qualifications of candidates than\r\n     men do. If the ballot in the hand of woman compels political\r\n     parties to place their best men in nomination, this, in and of\r\n     itself, is a sufficient reason for sustaining woman suffrage.\r\n\r\nEx-Chief Justice Fisher, of Cheyenne, said in 1883:\r\n\r\n     I wish I could show the people who are so wonderfully exercised\r\n     on the subject of female suffrage just how it works. The women\r\n     watch the nominating conventions, and if the Republicans put a\r\n     bad man on their ticket and the Democrats a good one, the\r\n     Republican women do not hesitate a moment in scratching off the\r\n     bad and substituting the good. It is just so with the Democratic\r\n     women. I have seen the effects of female suffrage, and instead of\r\n     being a means of encouragement to fraud and corruption, it tends\r\n     greatly to purify elections and give better government.\r\n\r\nIn 1884 Attorney-General M. C. Brown said in a public letter:\r\n\r\n     My prejudices were formerly all against woman suffrage, but they\r\n     have gradually given way since it became an established fact in\r\n     Wyoming. My observation, extending over a period of fifteen\r\n     years, satisfies me of its entire justice and propriety.\r\n     Impartial observation has also satisfied me that in the use of\r\n     the ballot women exercise fully as good judgment as men, and in\r\n     some particulars are more discriminating, as, for instance, on\r\n     questions of morals.\r\n\r\nAt another time he said:\r\n\r\n     I have been asked if women make good jurors, and I answer by\r\n     saying, that so far as I have observed their conduct on juries,\r\n     as a lawyer, I find but little fault with them.... They do not\r\n     reason like men upon the evidence, but, being possessed of a\r\n     higher quality of intellectuality, i. e., keen perceptions, they\r\n     see the truth of the thing at a glance. Their minds once settled,\r\n     neither sophistry, logic, rhetoric, pleading nor tears will move\r\n     them from their purpose. A guilty person never escapes a just\r\n     punishment when tried by women juries.\r\n\r\n     The effect of woman suffrage upon the people of Wyoming has been\r\n     good. It has been said by one man that open, flagrant acts of\r\n     bribery are commonly practiced at the polls in Wyoming, and this\r\n     statement is made to show that the effect of woman suffrage has\r\n     not been good. The statement is not true. In the last election\r\n     there were in Cheyenne large sums of money expended to influence\r\n     the result, and votes were bought on the streets in an open and\r\n     shameless manner. As U. S. Attorney for the Territory, it became\r\n     my duty to investigate this matter before a grand jury composed\r\n     of men. The revelations before the jury were astonishing and many\r\n     cases of bribery were clearly proven; but while a majority of\r\n     those composing the jury were men of the highest integrity, there\r\n     were so many members who had probably taken part in the same\r\n     unlawful transactions that no indictment could be obtained. The\r\n     circumstances attending this election were phenomenal. It would\r\n     be unjust to the women, however, if I should fail to add that,\r\n     while it was clearly proven that many men sold their votes, it\r\n     was strikingly apparent that few if any women, even of the vilest\r\n     class, were guilty of the same misconduct.\r\n\r\nThe Hon. John W. Kingman, for four years a Judge of the U. S. Supreme\r\nCourt of Wyoming says:\r\n\r\n     Woman suffrage was inaugurated in 1869 without much discussion,\r\n     and without any general movement of men or women in its favor. At\r\n     that time few women voted. At each election since, they have\r\n     voted in larger numbers, and now nearly all go to the polls. Our\r\n     women do not attend the caucuses in any considerable numbers, but\r\n     they generally take an interest in the selection of candidates,\r\n     and it is very common, in considering the availability of an\r\n     aspirant for office, to ask, 'How does he stand with the ladies?'\r\n     Frequently the men set aside certain applicants for office,\r\n     because their characters would not stand the criticism of women.\r\n     The women manifest a great deal of independence in their\r\n     preference for candidates, and have frequently defeated bad\r\n     nominations. Our best and most cultivated women vote, and vote\r\n     understandingly and independently, and they can not be bought\r\n     with whiskey or blinded by party prejudice. They are making\r\n     themselves felt at the polls, as they do everywhere else in\r\n     society, by a quiet but effectual discountenancing of the bad,\r\n     and a helping hand for the good and the true. We have had no\r\n     trouble from the presence of bad women at the polls. It has been\r\n     said that the delicate and cultured women would shrink away, and\r\n     the bold and indelicate come to the front in public affairs. This\r\n     we feared; but nothing of the kind has happened. I do not believe\r\n     that suffrage causes women to neglect their domestic affairs.\r\n     Certainly, such has not been the case in Wyoming, and I never\r\n     heard a man complain that his wife was less interested in\r\n     domestic economy because she had the right to vote and took an\r\n     interest in making the community respectable. The opposition to\r\n     woman suffrage at first was pretty bitter. To-day I do not think\r\n     you could get a dozen respectable men in any locality to oppose\r\n     it.\r\n\r\nIn 1895 U. S. Senator Clarence D. Clark wrote as follows to the\r\nConstitutional Convention of Utah which was considering a woman\r\nsuffrage plank:\r\n\r\n     So far as the operation of the law in this State is concerned, we\r\n     were so well satisfied, with twenty years' experience under the\r\n     Territorial government, that it went into our constitution with\r\n     but one dissenting vote, although many thought that such a\r\n     section might result in its rejection by Congress. If it does\r\n     nothing else it fulfils the theory of a true representative\r\n     government, and in this State, at least, has resulted in none of\r\n     the evils prophesied. It has not been the fruitful source of\r\n     family disagreements feared. It has not lowered womanhood. Women\r\n     do generally take advantage of the right to vote, and vote\r\n     intelligently. It has been years since we have had trouble at the\r\n     polls--quiet and order, in my opinion, being due to two causes,\r\n     the presence of women and our efficient election laws. One\r\n     important feature I might mention, and that is, in view of the\r\n     woman vote, no party dare nominate notoriously immoral men, for\r\n     fear of defeat by that vote. Regarding the adoption of the system\r\n     in other States I see no reason why its operation should not be\r\n     generally the same elsewhere as it is with us. It is surely true\r\n     that after many years' experience, Wyoming would not be content\r\n     to return to the old limits, as, in our opinion, the absence of\r\n     ill results is conclusive proof of the wisdom of the proposition.\r\n\r\nIn 1896 the Hon. H. V. S. Groesbeck, Chief Justice of the Supreme\r\nCourt, thus summed up the results of twenty-seven years' experience:\r\n\r\n     1. Woman suffrage has been weighed and not found wanting. Adopted\r\n     by a statute passed by the first legislative Assembly of the\r\n     Territory, in 1869, and approved by the Governor, it has\r\n     continued without interruption and with but one unsuccessful\r\n     demand for the repeal of the law. The constitutional convention\r\n     which assembled in 1889 adopted the equal suffrage provision and\r\n     refused to submit the question to a separate vote by a large\r\n     majority. The continuance of the measure for nearly a quarter of\r\n     a century, and the determination to incorporate it in the\r\n     fundamental law, even at the risk of failing to secure Statehood,\r\n     are the strongest arguments of its benefit and permanency.\r\n\r\n     2. It has tended to secure good nominations for the public\r\n     offices. The women as a class will not knowingly vote for\r\n     incompetent, immoral or inefficient candidates.\r\n\r\n     3. It has tended to make the women self-reliant and independent,\r\n     and to turn their attention to the study of the science of\r\n     government--an education that is needed by the mothers of the\r\n     race.\r\n\r\n     4. It has made our elections quiet and orderly. No rudeness,\r\n     brawling or disorder appears or would be tolerated at the polling\r\n     booths. There is no more difficulty or indelicacy in depositing a\r\n     ballot in the urn than in dropping a letter in the post office.\r\n\r\n     5. It has not marred domestic harmony. Husband and wife\r\n     frequently vote opposing tickets without disturbing the peace of\r\n     the home. Divorces are not as frequent here as in other\r\n     communities, even taking into consideration our small population.\r\n     Many applicants for divorces are from those who have a husband or\r\n     wife elsewhere, and the number of divorces granted for causes\r\n     arising in this State are comparatively few.\r\n\r\n     6. It has not resulted in unsexing women. They have not been\r\n     office-seekers. Women are generally selected for county\r\n     superintendents of the schools--offices for which they seem\r\n     particularly adapted, but they have not been applicants for other\r\n     positions.\r\n\r\n     7. Equal suffrage brings together at the ballot-box the\r\n     enlightened common sense of American manhood and the unselfish\r\n     moral sentiment of American womanhood. Both of these elements\r\n     govern a well-regulated household, and both should sway the\r\n     political destinies of the entire human family. Particularly do\r\n     we need in this new commonwealth the home influence at the\r\n     primaries and at the polls. We believe with Emerson that if all\r\n     the vices are represented in our politics, some of the virtues\r\n     should be.\r\n\r\nIn 1902 Justice Corn, of the State Supreme Court, made the following\r\npublic statement:\r\n\r\n     Women of all classes very generally vote. Bad women do not\r\n     obtrude their presence at the polls, and I do not now remember\r\n     ever to have seen a distinctively bad woman casting her vote.\r\n\r\n     Woman suffrage has no injurious effect upon the home or the\r\n     family that I have ever heard of during the twelve years I have\r\n     resided in the State. It does not take so much of women's time as\r\n     to interfere with their domestic duties, or with their church or\r\n     charitable work. It does not impair their womanliness or make\r\n     them less satisfactory as wives and mothers. They do not have\r\n     less influence, or enjoy less respect and consideration socially.\r\n     My impression is that they read the daily papers and inform\r\n     themselves upon public questions much more generally than women\r\n     elsewhere.\r\n\r\n     Woman suffrage has had the effect almost entirely to exclude\r\n     notoriously bad or immoral men from public office in the State.\r\n     Parties refuse to nominate such men upon the distinct ground that\r\n     they can not obtain the women's vote.\r\n\r\n     The natural result of such conditions is to increase the respect\r\n     in which women are held, and not to diminish it. They are a more\r\n     important factor in affairs, and therefore more regarded. It is\r\n     generally conceded, I think, that women have a higher standard of\r\n     morality and right living than men. And, as they have a say in\r\n     public matters, it has a tendency to make men respect their\r\n     standard, and in some degree attempt to attain it themselves.\r\n\r\n     I have never been an enthusiastic advocate of woman suffrage as a\r\n     cure for all the ills that afflict society, but I give you in\r\n     entire candor my impressions of it from my observations in this\r\n     State.\r\n\r\nIn 1889, after women in Wyoming had very generally exercised the full\r\nsuffrage since 1869, Mrs. Clara B. Colby, editor of the _Woman's\r\nTribune_, Washington, D. C., compiled a report from the census\r\nstatistics. Those relating to crime, insanity and divorce were as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n     The population of the United States has increased in the last\r\n     decade 24.6 per cent. That of Wyoming has increased 127.9 per\r\n     cent. But while the number of criminals in the whole United\r\n     States has increased 40.3--an alarming ratio far beyond the\r\n     increase of population--notwithstanding the immense increase of\r\n     population in Wyoming, the number of criminals has not increased\r\n     at all, but there has been a relative decrease, which shows a\r\n     law-abiding community and a constantly improving condition of the\r\n     public morals. In 1870 there were confined in the jails and\r\n     prisons of Wyoming 74 criminals, 72 men and 2 women. The census\r\n     of 1880 shows the same number of criminals, 74, as against an\r\n     average number of criminals in the other Western States of 645.\r\n     This remarkable fact is made more interesting because the 74 in\r\n     1890 are all men, and thus the scarecrow of the vicious women in\r\n     politics disappears. Wyoming being the only State in which the\r\n     per cent. of criminal women has decreased, it is evident that the\r\n     morals of the female part of the population improve with the\r\n     exercise of the right of suffrage.\r\n\r\n     There were 189,503 insane in the United States, but there were\r\n     but three insane persons in Wyoming in 1880, all men. The\r\n     preponderance of insanity among married women is usually\r\n     attributed to the monotony of their lives, and since this is much\r\n     relieved by their participation in politics we should naturally\r\n     expect to find, as a physical effect, a decreased proportion of\r\n     insane women where woman suffrage prevails.\r\n\r\n     From 1870 to 1880 the rate of divorce increased in the United\r\n     States 79.4 per cent., three times the ratio of the increase of\r\n     population, and in the group of Western States, omitting,\r\n     Wyoming, it increased 436.7 per cent., almost four times the\r\n     average increase of population, while in Wyoming the average\r\n     increase in divorce was less than 50 per cent. of that of the\r\n     population.\r\n\r\n     Compare Wyoming with a typical Eastern State--Connecticut--the\r\n     latter has one insane person to every 363 of the population,\r\n     Wyoming has one to every 1,497. Nor is this wholly a difference\r\n     of East and West, for Idaho, its neighbor, shows one insane to\r\n     every 1,029. Especially would voting seem to increase the\r\n     intelligence of women, for in Connecticut there are over\r\n     seven-tenths as many female idiots as there are male idiots,\r\n     while in Wyoming there are only four-tenths as many.\r\n\r\nWoman suffrage may have played no part in these statistics, but if\r\nthey had shown an _increase_ of crime, insanity and divorce, it\r\ncertainly would have been held responsible by the world at large.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nNEW YORK.\r\n\r\nThe History is indebted to Attorney-General John C. Davies for most of\r\nthe information on School Suffrage contained in the New York chapter,\r\nand also for the opinion which follows herewith on the right of women\r\nin that State to hold office.\r\n\r\n     By the Consolidated School Law it is provided, as regarding\r\n     School Commissioners, that \"No person shall be deemed ineligible\r\n     to such office by reason of sex, who has the other qualifications\r\n     as herewith provided;\" and regarding common school districts, it\r\n     is provided that \"Every district officer must be a resident of\r\n     his district and qualified to vote at its meetings.\" As certain\r\n     women are qualified to vote in any common school district, such\r\n     women are thus eligible to any _district_ office, including the\r\n     offices of trustee, clerk, collector, treasurer or librarian.\r\n\r\n     A similar provision in reference to union free schools, that \"No\r\n     person shall be eligible to hold any school district office in\r\n     any union free school district unless he or she is a qualified\r\n     voter in such district and is able to read and write,\" permits\r\n     women to hold office as members of the board of education and\r\n     other district offices.\r\n\r\n     Aside from Chapter 214 of the Laws of 1892, which has been held\r\n     to be unconstitutional, I know of no provision of law extending\r\n     school suffrage to women in _cities_, except that charters of\r\n     certain third class cities have extended to women tax-payers the\r\n     right to vote upon a proposition involving the raising of a tax.\r\n\r\n     By the Public Officers' Law, Chap. 681 of the Laws of 1892,\r\n     Section 3, it is provided that \"No person shall be capable of\r\n     holding a civil office who shall not, at the time he shall be\r\n     chosen thereto, be of full age, a citizen of the United States,\r\n     and resident of the State, and, if it be a local office, a\r\n     resident of the political subdivision or municipal corporation of\r\n     the State for which he shall be chosen, or within which the\r\n     electors electing him reside, or within which his official\r\n     functions are required to be exercised.\"\r\n\r\n     In the case of Findlay against Thorn, in the City Court of New\r\n     York, where the question arose as to the right of a woman to\r\n     exercise the office of notary public, Chief Justice McAdam\r\n     refused to pass upon the question, holding that the right could\r\n     be decided only in a direct proceeding brought for the purpose by\r\n     the Attorney-General, in which the notary might defend her title.\r\n     And the court adds:\r\n\r\n     \"Whether a female is capable of holding a public office has never\r\n     been decided by the courts of this State and it is a question\r\n     about which legal minds may well differ. The Constitution\r\n     regulates the right of suffrage and limits it to 'male' citizens.\r\n     Disabilities are not favored and are seldom extended by\r\n     implication, from which it may be argued that if it required the\r\n     insertion of the term 'male' to exclude female citizens of lawful\r\n     age from the right of suffrage, a similar limitation would be\r\n     required to disqualify them from holding office. Citizenship is a\r\n     condition or status and has no relation to age or sex. It may be\r\n     contended that it was left to the good sense of the Executive and\r\n     to the electors to determine whether or not they would elect\r\n     females to office and that the power being lodged in safe hands\r\n     was beyond danger of abuse.\r\n\r\n     \"If on the other hand it be seriously contended that the\r\n     Constitution by necessary implication, disqualifies females from\r\n     holding office, it must follow as a necessary consequence that\r\n     the Act of the Legislature permitting females to serve as school\r\n     officers (Chap. 9, Laws of 1880), and all other legislative\r\n     enactments of like import, removing such disqualifications, are\r\n     unconstitutional and void. In this same connection it may be\r\n     argued that if the use of the personal pronoun 'he' in the\r\n     Constitution does not exclude females from public office, its use\r\n     in the statute can have no greater effect. The statute, like the\r\n     Constitution, in prescribing qualifications for office omits the\r\n     word 'male,' leaving the question whether female citizens of\r\n     lawful age are included or excluded, one of construction.\r\n\r\n     \"I make these observations for the purpose of showing that the\r\n     question whether females are eligible to public office in this\r\n     State, is one not entirely free from doubt and should not\r\n     therefore be decided where it arises, as it does here,\r\n     incidentally and collaterally. When the law officers of the State\r\n     see fit to test the question in direct proceedings for the\r\n     purpose, it will be time enough to attempt to settle the\r\n     contention. In such a proceeding, the case of Robinson (131 Mass.\r\n     376, and that reported in 107 Mass. 604), where it was held that\r\n     a woman could not be admitted to practice as an attorney and\r\n     counselor at law in Massachusetts, and those decided in other\r\n     States that they can hold office, may be examined and\r\n     considered.\"\r\n\r\n     See also Am. and Eng. Ency. of Law, Vol. 19, p. 403-4. I might\r\n     add that in this State there are many women who hold the office\r\n     of notary public.\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\nWASHINGTON.\r\n\r\nThe following account of the unconstitutional disfranchising of the\r\nwomen of Washington Territory in 1888 was carefully prepared by the\r\neditors of the _Woman's Journal_ (Boston). When the editors of the\r\npresent volume decided to incorporate it as a part of the History of\r\nWoman Suffrage it was submitted to Judge Orange J. Jacobs of Seattle\r\nfor legal inspection. He returned it with the statement that it was\r\ncorrect in every particular. It constitutes one of the many judicial\r\noutrages which have been committed in the United States in the\r\ndetermination to prevent the enfranchisement of women:\r\n\r\n     Women voted in Washington Territory for the first time in 1884,\r\n     and were disfranchised by its Supreme Court in 1887.\r\n\r\n     Equal suffrage was granted by the Legislature in October, 1883.\r\n     The women at once began to distinguish themselves there, as in\r\n     Wyoming and elsewhere, by voting for the best man, irrespective\r\n     of party. The old files of the Washington newspapers bear ample\r\n     evidence to this fact. The first chance they had to vote was at\r\n     the municipal elections of July, 1884. The Seattle _Mirror_ said:\r\n\r\n     \"The city election of last Monday was for more reasons than one\r\n     the most important ever held in Seattle. The presence of women at\r\n     the voting-places had the effect of preventing the disgraceful\r\n     proceedings usually seen. It was the first election in the city\r\n     where the women could vote, and the first where the gambling and\r\n     liquor fraternity, which had so long controlled the municipal\r\n     government to an enormous extent, suffered defeat.\"\r\n\r\n     The _Post-Intelligencer_ said:\r\n\r\n     \"After the experience of the late election it will not do for any\r\n     one here to say the women do not want to vote. They displayed as\r\n     much interest as the men, and, if anything, more.... The result\r\n     insures Seattle a first-class municipal administration. It is a\r\n     warning to that undesirable class of the community who subsist\r\n     upon the weaknesses and vices of society that disregard of law\r\n     and the decencies of civilization will not be tolerated.\"\r\n\r\n     Quotations might be multiplied from the papers of other towns,\r\n     testifying to the independent voting of the women, the large size\r\n     of their vote, the courtesy with which they were treated, and the\r\n     greater quiet and order produced by their presence at the polls.\r\n\r\n     Next came the general election of November, 1884. Again the\r\n     newspapers were practically unanimous as to the result. The\r\n     Olympia _Transcript_, which was opposed to equal suffrage, said:\r\n     \"The result shows that all parties must put up good men if they\r\n     expect to elect them. They can not do as they have in the\r\n     past--nominate any candidates, and elect them by the force of the\r\n     party lash.\"\r\n\r\n     The _Democratic State Journal_ said: \"No one could fail to see\r\n     that hereafter more attention must be given at the primaries to\r\n     select the purest of material, by both parties, if they would\r\n     gain the female vote.\"\r\n\r\n     Charles J. Woodbury visited Washington about this time. In a\r\n     letter to the N. Y. _Evening Post_, he said: \"Whatever may be the\r\n     vicissitudes of woman suffrage in Washington Territory in the\r\n     future, it should now be put on record that at the election, Nov.\r\n     4, 1884, nine-tenths of its adult female population availed\r\n     themselves of the right to vote with a hearty enthusiasm.\"\r\n\r\n     He goes on to say that he arrived in Seattle on Sunday, and was\r\n     surprised at the quiet and order he found prevailing, and at the\r\n     general Sunday closing of the places of business: \"Even the bars\r\n     of the hotels were closed; and this was the worst town in the\r\n     Territory when I first saw it. Now its uproarious theaters,\r\n     dance-houses, squaw-brothels and Sunday fights are things of the\r\n     past. Not a gambling house exists.\"\r\n\r\n     Women served on juries, and meted out the full penalty of the law\r\n     to gamblers and keepers of disorderly houses. The Chief Justice\r\n     of the Territory was the Hon. Roger S. Greene, a cousin of U. S.\r\n     Senator Hoar, a man of high character and integrity, and a\r\n     magistrate celebrated throughout the Northwest for his resolute\r\n     and courageous resistance to lynch law. In his charge to the\r\n     grand jury at Port Townsend, August, 1884, he said:\r\n\r\n     \"The opponents of woman suffrage in this Territory are found\r\n     allied with a solid phalanx of gamblers, prostitutes, pimps, and\r\n     drunkard-makers--a phalanx composed of all in each of those\r\n     classes who know the interest of the class and vote according to\r\n     it.\"\r\n\r\n     In his charge to another grand jury later, Chief Justice Greene\r\n     said:\r\n\r\n     \"Twelve terms of court, ladies and gentlemen, I have now held, in\r\n     which women have served as grand and petit jurors, and it is\r\n     certainly a fact beyond dispute that no other twelve terms so\r\n     salutary for restraint of crime have ever been held in this\r\n     Territory. For fifteen years I have been trying to do what a\r\n     judge ought, but have never till the last six months felt\r\n     underneath and around me, in the degree that every judge has a\r\n     right to feel it, the upbuoying might of the people in the line\r\n     of full and resolute enforcement of the law.\"\r\n\r\n     Naturally, the vicious elements disliked \"the full and resolute\r\n     enforcement of law.\" The baser sort of politicians also disliked\r\n     the independent voting of the women. The Republicans had a normal\r\n     majority in the Territory, but they nominated for a high office a\r\n     man who was a hard drinker. The Republican women would not vote\r\n     for him, and he was defeated. Next they nominated a man who had\r\n     for years been openly living with an Indian woman and had a\r\n     family of half-breed children. Again the Republican women refused\r\n     to vote for him, and he was defeated. This brought the enmity of\r\n     the Republican \"machine\" upon woman suffrage. The Democratic\r\n     women showed equal independence, and incurred the hostility of\r\n     the Democratic \"machine.\"\r\n\r\n     Between 1884 and 1888 a change of administration at Washington\r\n     led to a change in the Territorial Supreme Court. The newly\r\n     appointed Chief Justice and a majority of the new judges of the\r\n     Supreme Court [appointed by President Cleveland] were opposed to\r\n     equal suffrage, and were amenable, it is said, to the strong\r\n     pressure brought to bear upon them by all the vicious elements to\r\n     secure its repeal. A gambler who had been convicted by a jury\r\n     composed in part of women contested the sentence on the ground\r\n     that women were not legal voters, and the Supreme Court decided\r\n     that the woman suffrage bill was unconstitutional, because it had\r\n     been headed \"An Act to Amend Section So and So, Chapter So and So\r\n     of the Code,\" instead of \"An Act to Enfranchise Women.\".... When\r\n     the Legislature met in 1888 it re-enacted the woman suffrage\r\n     bill, giving it a full heading, and strengthening it in every way\r\n     possible.\r\n\r\n     Washington was about to be admitted as a State, and was preparing\r\n     to hold a Constitutional Convention to frame a State\r\n     constitution. There was no doubt that the majority of the women\r\n     wanted to vote. Chief Justice Greene estimated that four-fifths\r\n     of them had voted at the last election before they were deprived\r\n     of the right. Two successive Legislatures elected by men and\r\n     women jointly had re-enacted woman suffrage (for its continuance\r\n     had been made a test question in the choice of the first\r\n     Legislature for which the women voted, and that Legislature had\r\n     been careful to insert the words \"he or she\" in all bills\r\n     relating to the election laws). It was admitted on all hands that\r\n     if the women were allowed to vote for members of the\r\n     Constitutional Convention, it would be impossible to elect one\r\n     that would wipe out woman suffrage. It was therefore imperative\r\n     to deprive the women of their votes before the members of the\r\n     convention were chosen. A scheme was arranged for the purpose.\r\n     On the ground that she was a woman, the election officers at a\r\n     local election refused the vote of Mrs. Nevada Bloomer, a\r\n     saloon-keeper's wife, who was opposed to suffrage. _They accepted\r\n     the votes of all the other women._ She made a test case by\r\n     bringing suit against them. In the ordinary course of things, the\r\n     case would not have come up till after the election of the\r\n     constitutional convention. But cases for the restoration of\r\n     personal rights may be advanced on the docket, and Mrs. Bloomer's\r\n     ostensible object was the restoration of her personal rights,\r\n     though her real object was to deprive all women of theirs. Her\r\n     case was put forward on the docket and hurried to a decision.\r\n\r\n     The Supreme Court [George Turner and Wm. G. Langford] this time\r\n     pronounced the woman suffrage law unconstitutional on the ground\r\n     that _it was beyond the power of a Territorial Legislature to\r\n     enfranchise women_. The Organic Act of the Territory said that at\r\n     the first Territorial election persons with certain\r\n     qualifications should vote, and at subsequent elections _such\r\n     persons as the Territorial Legislature might enfranchise_. But\r\n     the court took the ground that in giving the Legislature the\r\n     right to regulate suffrage, Congress did not at the time have it\r\n     specifically in mind that they might enfranchise women, and that\r\n     therefore they could not do so.(!) The suffragists wanted to have\r\n     the case appealed to the Supreme Court of the United States, but\r\n     Mrs. Bloomer refused.\r\n\r\n     The women themselves being prevented from voting, their friends\r\n     were not able to overcome the combined \"machines\" of both\r\n     political parties, and the intense opposition of all the vicious\r\n     and disorderly elements, at that time very large on the Pacific\r\n     Coast. A convention opposed to equal suffrage was elected, and\r\n     framed a constitution excluding women. A friend of the present\r\n     writer talked with many of the members while the convention was\r\n     in session. He says almost every lawyer in that body\r\n     acknowledged, in private conversation, that the decision by which\r\n     the women had been disfranchised was illegal. \"But,\" they said,\r\n     \"the women had set the community by the ears on the temperance\r\n     question, and we had to get rid of them.\" One politician said,\r\n     frankly, \"Women are natural mugwumps, and I hate a mugwump.\"\r\n\r\n     The convention, however, yielded to the pressure sufficiently to\r\n     submit to the men a separate amendment proposing to strike out\r\n     the word \"male\" from the suffrage clause of the new State\r\n     constitution, but no woman was allowed to vote on it. In\r\n     November, 1889, this amendment was lost, the same elements that\r\n     defeated it in the convention defeating it at the polls, with the\r\n     addition of a great influx of foreign immigrants.\r\n\r\n\r\nNATIONAL-AMERICAN WOMAN SUFFRAGE ASSOCIATION.\r\n\r\nThis is the most democratic of organizations. Its sole object is to\r\nsecure for women citizens protection in their right to vote. The\r\ngeneral officers are nominated by an informal secret ballot, no one\r\nbeing put in nomination. The three persons receiving the highest\r\nnumber of votes are considered the nominees and the election is\r\ndecided by secret ballot. Those entitled to vote are three\r\ndelegates-at-large for each auxiliary State society and one delegate\r\nin addition for every one hundred members of each State auxiliary; the\r\nState presidents and State members of the National Executive\r\nCommittee; the general officers of the association; the chairmen of\r\nstanding committees. The delegates present from each State cast the\r\nfull vote to which that State is entitled. The vote is taken in the\r\nsame way upon any other question whenever the delegates present from\r\nfive States request it. In other cases each delegate has one vote.\r\nAny State whose dues are unpaid on January 1 loses its vote in the\r\nconvention for that year.\r\n\r\nThe two honorary presidents, president, vice-president-at-large, two\r\nsecretaries, treasurer and two auditors constitute the Business\r\nCommittee, which transacts the entire business of the association\r\nbetween the annual conventions.\r\n\r\nThe Executive Committee is composed of the Business Committee, the\r\npresident of each State, and one member from each State, together with\r\nthe chairmen of standing committees; fifteen make a quorum for the\r\ntransaction of business. The decisions reached by the Executive\r\nCommittee, which meets during the convention week, are presented in\r\nthe form of recommendations at the business sessions of the\r\nconvention.\r\n\r\nThe constitution may be amended by a two-thirds vote at any annual\r\nmeeting, after one day's notice in the convention, notice of the\r\nproposed amendment having been previously given to the Business\r\nCommittee, and by them published in the suffrage papers not less than\r\nthree months in advance.\r\n\r\nThe association must hold an annual convention of regularly-elected\r\ndelegates for the election of officers and the transaction of\r\nbusiness. An annual meeting must be held in Washington, D. C., during\r\nthe first session of each Congress.\r\n\r\nThe Committee on Resolutions must consist of one person from each\r\nState, elected by its delegation.\r\n\r\nThere are few changes in officers and the association is noted for the\r\nharmony of its meetings, although the delegates generally are of\r\ndecided convictions and unusual force of character. Men are eligible\r\nto membership and a number belong, but the affairs of the organization\r\nare wholly in the hands of women.\r\n\r\nAuxiliary State and Territorial associations exist in all but Wyoming,\r\nIdaho, Utah, Arkansas, Nevada and Texas. Suffrage associations are not\r\nneeded in the first three, as the women have the full franchise.\r\n\r\n\r\nOFFICERS FOR 1900.\r\n\r\nHonorary Presidents, ELIZABETH CADY STANTON, New York City; SUSAN B.\r\nANTHONY, Rochester, N.

Most of the\r\nnames given above are of those who have in some way openly advocated\r\nthe measure. Practically all of the members from the States where\r\nwomen have the full franchise are in favor, and there always has been\r\na large number from Kansas. In 1896, in response to letters of\r\ninquiry, many announced themselves as ready to vote for a suffrage\r\namendment.\r\n\r\n[501] This is supplementary to matter contained in the State chapters.\r\n\r\n\r\nSTANDING COMMITTEES.\r\n\r\nPROGRAMME--Carrie Chapman Catt, N.

It has seemed practicable to reduce very\r\ngreatly the length of this one without impairing its efficiency by\r\nasking the reader to bear in mind a few simple facts as to the\r\narrangement of the History.\r\n\r\nChapters II-XXI are devoted exclusively to the conventions of the\r\nNational Suffrage Association and the consequent hearings, reports and\r\ndiscussions in Congress; the story of each year is complete in its\r\nchapter and the date is in the running title on the right hand page.\r\nThe work of the American Association before the two societies united\r\nis complete in Chapter XXII. These chapters contain the _argument_.\r\n\r\nChapters XXV-LXXII comprise the full history of the work in the States\r\nand Territories, one chapter given to each and all alphabetically\r\narranged with name in running title on the right hand page. Each State\r\nis subdivided and the heads denoted by capital letters, as follows:\r\nOrganization, Legislative Action, Laws, Suffrage, Office Holding,\r\nOccupation, Education.\r\n\r\nThe other chapters are clearly designated in the Table of Contents,\r\nand practically all the information which the book contains on each\r\nsubject will be found in its respective chapter. The greatest problem\r\nhas been the indexing of the many _speeches_ so as to convey an idea\r\nof their subject-matter, as a number of them cover a variety of\r\ntopics, and it has been possible to indicate only the principal\r\npoints. The editors trust, however, that the systematic arrangement of\r\nthe volume and the full Table of Contents will enable the reader to\r\nobtain the desired information without difficulty.\r\n\r\n\r\n  _Age of Protection_, 460,\r\n    and in each State chapter under _Legislative Action and Laws_,\r\n      beginning 465.\r\n\r\n  AMENDMENT CAMPAIGNS FOR WOMAN SUFFRAGE, xxi; 40;\r\n    in Calif., 486;\r\n    in Col., 513;\r\n    in S.

With\r\nhalf-a-dozen exceptions the State chapters are very short and it will\r\nrequire only a few minutes for the reader to find any name desired.\r\nMost of the prominent State workers are mentioned elsewhere and\r\ntherefore are listed. Even with this arrangement the Index contains\r\nalmost 1200 names.\r\n\r\n  Abbott, Dr. Lyman, 742.\r\n\r\n  Abbott, Mrs. Lyman, organizes anti-suff. soc., 850.\r\n\r\n  Abbott, Merrie Hoover, contest for office of pros. att'y., 770.\r\n\r\n  Aberdeen, Ishbel, Countess of, 301;\r\n    compliments Amer. wom., 353; 354.\r\n\r\n  Adams, Abigail, on female education, 354;\r\n    courtship, 422.\r\n\r\n  Adams, Gov.
