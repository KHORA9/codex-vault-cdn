THURSTON.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nPREFACE.\r\n\r\n\r\nThis little work embodies the more generally interesting portions of\r\nlectures first written for delivery at the STEVENS INSTITUTE OF\r\nTECHNOLOGY, in the winter of 1871-'72, to a mixed audience, composed,\r\nhowever, principally of engineers by profession, and of mechanics; it\r\ncomprises, also, some material prepared for other occasions.\r\n\r\nThese lectures have been rewritten and considerably extended, and have\r\nbeen given a form which is more appropriate to this method of\r\npresentation of the subject. The account of the gradual development of\r\nthe philosophy of the steam-engine has been extended and considerably\r\nchanged, both in arrangement and in method. That part in which the\r\ndirection of improvement during the past history of the steam-engine,\r\nthe course which it is to-day taking, and the direction and limitation\r\nof that improvement in the future, are traced, has been somewhat\r\nmodified to accord with the character of the revised work.\r\n\r\nThe author has consulted a large number of authors in the course of\r\nhis work, and is very greatly indebted to several earlier writers. Of\r\nthese, Stuart[1] is entitled to particular mention. His \"History\" is\r\nthe earliest deserving the name; and his \"Anecdotes\" are of\r\nexceedingly great interest and of equally great historical value. The\r\nartistic and curious little sketches at the end of each chapter are\r\nfrom John Stuart, as are, usually, the drawings of the older forms of\r\nengines.\r\n\r\n  [1] \"History of the Steam-Engine,\" London, 1824. \"Anecdotes of the\r\n  Steam-Engine,\" London, 1829.\r\n\r\nGreenwood's excellent translation of Hero, as edited by Bennett\r\nWoodcroft (London, 1851), can be consulted by those who are curious to\r\nlearn more of that interesting old Greek treatise.\r\n\r\nSome valuable matter is from Farey,[2] who gives the most extended\r\naccount extant of Newcomen's and Watt's engines. The reader who\r\ndesires to know more of the life of Worcester, and more of the details\r\nof his work, will find in the very complete biography of Dircks[3] all\r\nthat he can wish to learn of that great but unfortunate inventor.\r\nSmiles's admirably written biography of Watt[4] gives an equally\r\ninteresting and complete account of the great mechanic and of his\r\npartners; and Muirhead[5] furnishes us with a still more detailed\r\naccount of his inventions.\r\n\r\n  [2] \"Treatise on the Steam-Engine,\" London, 1827.\r\n\r\n  [3] \"Life, Times, and Scientific Labors of the Second Marquis of\r\n  Worcester,\" London, 1865.\r\n\r\n  [4] \"Lives of Boulton and Watt,\" London, 1865.\r\n\r\n  [5] \"Life of James Watt,\" D. Appleton & Co., New York, 1859.\r\n  \"Mechanical Inventions of James Watt,\" London, 1854.\r\n\r\nFor an account of the life and work of John Elder, the great pioneer\r\nin the introduction of the now standard double-cylinder, or\r\n\"compound,\" engine, the student can consult a little biographical\r\nsketch by Prof. Rankine, published soon after the death of Elder.\r\n\r\nThe only published sketch of the history of the science of\r\nthermo-dynamics, which plays so large a part of the philosophy of the\r\nsteam-engine, is that of Prof. Tait--a most valuable monograph.\r\n\r\nThe section of this work which treats of the causes and the extent of\r\nlosses of heat in the steam-engine, and of the methods available, or\r\npossibly available, to reduce the amount of this now immense waste of\r\nheat, is, in some respects, quite new, and is equally novel in the\r\nmethod of its presentation. The portraits with which the book is well\r\nfurnished are believed to be authentic, and, it is hoped, will lend\r\ninterest, if not adding to the real value of the work.\r\n\r\nAmong other works which have been of great assistance to the author,\r\nand will be found, perhaps, equally valuable to some of the readers of\r\nthis little treatise, are several to which reference has not been made\r\nin the text. Among them the following are deserving of special\r\nmention: Zeuner's \"Waermetheorie,\" the treatises of Stewart and of\r\nMaxwell, and McCulloch's \"Mechanical Theory of Heat,\" a short but\r\nthoroughly logical and exact mathematical treatise; Cotterill's\r\n\"Steam-Engine considered as a Heat-Engine,\" a more extended work on\r\nthe same subject, which will be found an excellent companion to, and\r\ncommentary upon, Rankine's \"Steam-Engine and Prime Movers,\" which is\r\nthe standard treatise on the theory of the steam-engine. The works of\r\nBourne, of Holley, of Clarke, and of Forney, are standards on the\r\npractical every-day matters of steam-engine construction and\r\nmanagement.\r\n\r\nThe author is almost daily in receipt of inquiries which indicate that\r\nthe above remarks will be of service to very many young engineers, as\r\nwell as to many to whom the steam-engine is of interest from a more\r\npurely scientific point of view.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                           CONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n                          CHAPTER I.\r\n\r\n             THE STEAM-ENGINE AS A SIMPLE MACHINE.\r\n                                                                  PAGE\r\n  SECTION I.--THE PERIOD OF SPECULATION--FROM HERO TO WORCESTER,\r\n  B.

C.\r\n200 TO A. D. 1650.\r\n\r\nOne of the greatest of modern philosophers--the founder of that system\r\nof scientific philosophy which traces the processes of evolution in\r\nevery department, whether physical or intellectual--has devoted a\r\nchapter of his \"First Principles\" of the new system to the\r\nconsideration of the multiplication of the effects of the various\r\nforces, social and other, which are continually modifying this\r\nwonderful and mysterious universe of which we form a part. Herbert\r\nSpencer, himself an engineer, there traces the wide-spreading,\r\nnever-ceasing influences of new inventions, of the introduction of new\r\nforms of mechanism, and of the growth of industrial organization, with\r\na clearness and a conciseness which are so eminently characteristic of\r\nhis style. His illustration of this idea by reference to the manifold\r\neffects of the introduction of steam-power and its latest embodiment,\r\nthe locomotive-engine, is one of the strongest passages in his work.\r\nThe power of the steam-engine, and its inconceivable importance as an\r\nagent of civilization, has always been a favorite theme with\r\nphilosophers and historians as well as poets. As Religion has always\r\nbeen, and still is, the great _moral_ agent in civilizing the world,\r\nand as Science is the great _intellectual_ promoter of civilization,\r\nso the Steam-Engine is, in modern times, the most important _physical_\r\nagent in that great work.\r\n\r\nIt would be superfluous to attempt to enumerate the benefits which it\r\nhas conferred upon the human race, for such an enumeration would\r\ninclude an addition to every comfort and the creation of almost every\r\nluxury that we now enjoy. The wonderful progress of the present\r\ncentury is, in a very great degree, due to the invention and\r\nimprovement of the steam-engine, and to the ingenious application of\r\nits power to kinds of work that formerly taxed the physical energies\r\nof the human race. We cannot examine the methods and processes of any\r\nbranch of industry without discovering, somewhere, the assistance and\r\nsupport of this wonderful machine. Relieving mankind from manual toil,\r\nit has left to the intellect the privilege of directing the power,\r\nformerly absorbed in physical labor, into other and more profitable\r\nchannels. The intelligence which has thus conquered the powers of\r\nNature, now finds itself free to do head-work; the force formerly\r\nutilized in the carrying of water and the hewing of wood, is now\r\nexpended in the God-like work of THOUGHT. What, then, can be more\r\ninteresting than to trace the history of the growth of this wonderful\r\nmachine?--the greatest among the many great creations of one of God's\r\nmost beneficent gifts to man--the power of invention.\r\n\r\nWhile following the records and traditions which relate to the\r\nsteam-engine, I propose to call attention to the fact that its history\r\nillustrates the very important truth: _Great inventions are never, and\r\ngreat discoveries are seldom, the work of any one mind_. Every great\r\ninvention is really either an aggregation of minor inventions, or the\r\nfinal step of a progression. It is not a creation, but _a growth_--as\r\ntruly so as is that of the trees in the forest. Hence, the same\r\ninvention is frequently brought out in several countries, and by\r\nseveral individuals, simultaneously. Frequently an important invention\r\nis made before the world is ready to receive it, and the unhappy\r\ninventor is taught, by his failure, that it is as unfortunate to be in\r\nadvance of his age as to be behind it. Inventions only become\r\nsuccessful when they are not only needed, but when mankind is so far\r\nadvanced in intelligence as to appreciate and to express the necessity\r\nfor them, and to at once make use of them.\r\n\r\nMore than half a century ago, an able New England writer, in a\r\ncommunication to an English engineering periodical, described the new\r\nmachinery which was built at Newport, R. I., by John Babcock and\r\nRobert L. Thurston, for one of the first steamboats that ever ran\r\nbetween that city and New York. He prefaced his description with a\r\nfrequently-quoted remark to the effect that, as Minerva sprang, mature\r\nin mind, in full stature of body, and completely armed, from the head\r\nof Jupiter, so the steam-engine came forth, perfect at its birth, from\r\nthe brain of James Watt. But we shall see, as we examine the records\r\nof its history, that, although James Watt was _an_ inventor, and\r\nprobably the greatest of the inventors of the steam-engine, he was\r\nstill but one of the many men who have aided in perfecting it, and who\r\nhave now made us so familiar with it, and its tremendous power and its\r\nfacile adaptations, that we have almost ceased to admire it, or to\r\nwonder at the workings of the still more admirable intelligence that\r\nhas so far perfected it.\r\n\r\nTwenty-one centuries ago, the political power of Greece was broken,\r\nalthough Grecian civilization had risen to its zenith. Rome, ruder\r\nthan her polished neighbor, was growing continually stronger, and was\r\nrapidly gaining territory by absorbing weaker states. Egypt, older in\r\ncivilization than either Greece or Rome, fell but two centuries later\r\nbefore the assault of the younger states, and became a Roman province.\r\nHer principal city was at this time Alexandria, founded by the great\r\nsoldier whose name it bears, when in the full tide of his prosperity.\r\nIt had now become a great and prosperous city, the centre of the\r\ncommerce of the world, the home of students and of learned men, and\r\nits population was the wealthiest and most civilized of the then known\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nIt is among the relics of that ancient Egyptian civilization that we\r\nfind the first records in the early history of the steam-engine. In\r\nAlexandria, the home of Euclid, the great geometrician, and possibly\r\ncontemporary with that talented engineer and mathematician,\r\nArchimedes, a learned writer, called Hero, produced a manuscript which\r\nhe entitled \"Spiritalia seu Pneumatica.\"\r\n\r\nIt is quite uncertain whether Hero was the inventor of any number of\r\nthe contrivances described in his work. It is most probable that the\r\napparatus described are principally devices which had either been long\r\nknown, or which were invented by Ctesibius, an inventor who was famous\r\nfor the number and ingenuity of the hydraulic and pneumatic machines\r\nthat he devised. Hero states, in his Introduction, his intention to\r\ndescribe existing machines and earlier inventions, and to add his own.\r\nNothing in the text, however, indicates to whom the several machines\r\nare to be ascribed.[6]\r\n\r\n  [6] The British Museum contains four manuscript copies of Hero's\r\n  \"Pneumatics,\" which were written in the fifteenth and sixteenth\r\n  centuries. These manuscripts have been examined with great care, and\r\n  a translation from them prepared by Prof. J. G. Greenwood, and\r\n  published at the desire of Mr. Bennett Woodcroft, the author of a\r\n  valuable little treatise on \"Steam Navigation.\" This is, so far as\r\n  the author is aware, the only existing English translation of any\r\n  portion of Hero's works.\r\n\r\nThe first part of Hero's work is devoted to applications of the\r\nsyphon. The 11th proposition is the first application of heat to\r\nproduce motion of fluids.\r\n\r\nAn altar and its pedestal are hollow and air-tight. A liquid is poured\r\ninto the pedestal, and a pipe inserted, of which the lower end passes\r\nbeneath the surface of the liquid, and the upper extremity leads\r\nthrough a figure standing at the altar, and terminates in a vessel\r\ninverted above this altar. When a fire is made on the altar, the heat\r\nproduced expands the confined air, and the liquid is driven up the\r\ntube, issuing from the vessel in the hand of the figure standing by\r\nthe altar, which thus seems to be offering a libation. This toy\r\nembodies the essential principle of all modern heat-engines--the\r\nchange of energy from the form known as heat-energy into mechanical\r\nenergy, or work. It is not at all improbable that this prototype of\r\nthe modern wonder-working machine may have been known centuries before\r\nthe time of Hero.\r\n\r\nMany forms of hydraulic apparatus, including the hand fire-engine,\r\nwhich is familiar to us, and is still used in many of our smaller\r\ncities, are described, the greater number of which are probably\r\nattributable to Ctesibius. They demand no description here.\r\n\r\nA hot-air engine, however, which is the subject of his 37th\r\nproposition, is of real interest.\r\n\r\nHero sketches and describes a method of opening temple-doors by the\r\naction of fire on an altar, which is an ingenious device, and contains\r\nall the elements of the machine of the Marquis of Worcester, which is\r\ngenerally considered the first real steam-engine, with the single and\r\nvital defect that the expanding fluid is air instead of steam. The\r\nsketch, from Greenwood's translation, exhibits the device very\r\nplainly. Beneath the temple-doors, in the space _A B C D_, is placed a\r\nspherical vessel, _H_, containing water. A pipe, _F G_, connects the\r\nupper part of this sphere with the hollow and air-tight shell of the\r\naltar above, _D E_. Another pipe, _K L M_, leads from the bottom of\r\nthe vessel, _H_, over, in syphon-shape, to the bottom of a suspended\r\nbucket, _N X_. The suspending cord is carried over a pulley and led\r\naround two vertical barrels, _O P_, turning on pivots at their feet,\r\nand carrying the doors above. Ropes led over a pulley, _R_, sustain a\r\ncounterbalance, _W_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 1.--Opening Temple-Doors by Steam, B. C. 200.]\r\n\r\nOn building a fire on the altar, the heated air within expands, passes\r\nthrough the pipe, _F G_, and drives the water contained in the vessel,\r\n_H_, through the syphon, _K L M_, into the bucket, _N X_. The weight\r\nof the bucket, which then descends, turns the barrels, _O P_, raises\r\nthe counterbalance, and opens the doors of the temple. On\r\nextinguishing the fire, the air is condensed, the water returns\r\nthrough the syphon from the bucket to the sphere, the counterbalance\r\nfalls, and the doors are closed.\r\n\r\nAnother contrivance is next described, in which the bucket is replaced\r\nby an air-tight bag, which, expanding as the heated air enters it,\r\ncontracts vertically and actuates the mechanism, which in other\r\nrespects is similar to that just described.\r\n\r\nIn these devices the spherical vessel is a perfect anticipation of\r\nthe vessels used many centuries later by several so-called inventors\r\nof the steam-engine.\r\n\r\nProposition 45 describes the familiar experiment of a ball supported\r\naloft by a jet of fluid. In this example steam is generated in a close\r\ncauldron, and issues from a pipe inserted in the top, the ball dancing\r\non the issuing jet.\r\n\r\nNo. 47 is a device subsequently reproduced--perhaps reinvented by the\r\nsecond Marquis of Worcester.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 2.--Steam Fountain, B. C. 200.]\r\n\r\nA strong, close vessel, _A B C D_, forms a pedestal, on which are\r\nmounted a spherical vessel, _E F_, and a basin. A pipe, _H K_, is led\r\nfrom the bottom of the larger vessel into the upper part of the\r\nsphere, and another pipe from the lower part of the latter, in the\r\nform of a syphon, over to the basin, _M_. A drain-pipe, _N O_, leads\r\nfrom the basin to the reservoir, _A D_. The whole contrivance is\r\ncalled \"A fountain which is made to flow by the action of the sun's\r\nrays.\"\r\n\r\nIt is operated thus: The vessel, _E F_, being filled nearly to the top\r\nwith water, or other liquid, and exposed to the action of the sun's\r\nrays, the air above the water expands, and drives the liquid over,\r\nthrough the syphon, _G_, into the basin, _M_, and it will fall into\r\nthe pedestal, _A B C D_.\r\n\r\nHero goes on to state that, on the removal of the sun's rays, the air\r\nin the sphere will contract, and that the water will be returned to\r\nthe sphere from the pedestal. This can, evidently, only occur when the\r\npipe _G_ is closed previous to the commencement of this cooling. No\r\nsuch cock is mentioned, and it is not unlikely that the device only\r\nexisted on paper.\r\n\r\nSeveral steam-boilers are described, usually simple pipes or\r\ncylindrical vessels, and the steam generated in them by the heat of\r\nthe fire on the altar forms a steam-blast. This blast is either\r\ndirected into the fire, or it \"makes a blackbird sing,\" blows a horn\r\nfor a triton, or does other equally useless work. In one device, No.\r\n70, the steam issues from a reaction-wheel revolving in the horizontal\r\nplane, and causes dancing images to circle about the altar. A more\r\nmechanical and more generally-known form of this device is that which\r\nis frequently described as the \"First Steam Engine.\" The sketch from\r\nStuart is similar in general form, but more elaborate in detail, than\r\nthat copied by Greenwood, which is here also reproduced, as\r\nrepresenting more accurately the simple form which the mechanism of\r\nthe \"AEolipile,\" or Ball of AEolus, assumed in those early times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 3.--Hero's Engine, B. C. 200.]\r\n\r\nThe cauldron, _A B_, contains water, and is covered by the steam-tight\r\ncover, _C D_. A globe is supported above the cauldron by a pair of\r\ntubes, terminating, the one, _C M_, in a pivot, _L_, and the other,\r\n_E F_, opening directly into the sphere at _G_. Short, bent pipes, _H_\r\nand _K_, issue from points diametrically opposite each other, and are\r\nopen at their extremities.\r\n\r\nA fire being made beneath the cauldron, steam is formed and finds exit\r\nthrough the pipe, _E F G_, into the globe, and thence rushes out of\r\nthe pipes, _H K_, turning the globe on its axis, _G L_, by the\r\nunbalanced pressure thus produced.\r\n\r\nThe more elaborate sketch which forms the frontispiece represents a\r\nmachine of similar character. Its design and ornamentation illustrate\r\nwell the characteristics of ancient art, and the Greek idea of the\r\nsteam-engine.\r\n\r\nThis \"AEolipile\" consisted of a globe, _X_, suspended between\r\ntrunnions, _O S_, through one of which steam enters from the boiler,\r\n_P_, below. The hollow, bent arms, _W_ and _Z_, cause the vapor to\r\nissue in such directions that the reaction produces a rotary movement\r\nof the globe, just as the rotation of reaction water-wheels is\r\nproduced by the outflowing water.\r\n\r\nIt is quite uncertain whether this machine was ever more than a toy,\r\nalthough it has been supposed by some authorities that it was actually\r\nused by the Greek priests for the purpose of producing motion of\r\napparatus in their temples.\r\n\r\nIt seems sufficiently remarkable that, while the power of steam had\r\nbeen, during all the many centuries that man has existed upon the\r\nglobe, so universally displayed in so many of the phenomena of natural\r\nchange, that mankind lived almost up to the Christian era without\r\nmaking it useful in giving motion even to a toy; but it excites still\r\ngreater surprise that, from the time of Hero, we meet with no good\r\nevidence of its application to practical purposes for many hundreds of\r\nyears.\r\n\r\nHere and there in the pages of history, and in special treatises, we\r\nfind a hint that the knowledge of the force of steam was not lost; but\r\nit is not at all to the credit of biographers and of historians, that\r\nthey have devoted so little time to the task of seeking and recording\r\ninformation relating to the progress of this and other important\r\ninventions and improvements in the mechanic arts.\r\n\r\nMalmesbury states[7] that, in the year A. D. 1125, there existed at\r\nRheims, in the church of that town, a clock designed or constructed by\r\nGerbert, a professor in the schools there, and an organ blown by air\r\nescaping from a vessel in which it was compressed \"by heated water.\"\r\n\r\n  [7] Stuart's \"Anecdotes.\"\r\n\r\nHieronymus Cardan, a wonderful mathematical genius, a most eccentric\r\nphilosopher, and a distinguished physician, about the middle of the\r\nsixteenth century called attention, in his writings, to the power of\r\nsteam, and to the facility with which a vacuum can be obtained by its\r\ncondensation. This Cardan was the author of \"Cardan's Formula,\" or\r\nrule for the solution of cubic equations, and was the inventor of the\r\n\"smoke-jack.\" He has been called a \"philosopher, juggler, and madman.\"\r\nHe was certainly a learned mathematician, a skillful physician, and a\r\ngood mechanic.\r\n\r\nMany traces are found, in the history of the sixteenth century, of the\r\nexistence of some knowledge of the properties of steam, and some\r\nanticipation of the advantages to follow its application. Matthesius,\r\nA. D. 1571, in one of his sermons describes a contrivance which may be\r\ntermed a steam-engine, and enlarges on the \"tremendous results which\r\nmay follow the volcanic action of a small quantity of confined\r\nvapor;\"[8] and another writer applied the steam aeolipile of Hero to\r\nturn the spit, and thus rivaled and excelled Cardan, who was\r\nintroducing his \"smoke-jack.\"\r\n\r\n  [8] \"Berg-Postilla, oder Sarepta von Bergwerk und Metallen.\"\r\n  Nuremberg, 1571.\r\n\r\nAs Stuart says, the inventor enumerated its excellent qualities with\r\ngreat minuteness. He claimed that it would \"eat nothing, and giving,\r\nwithal, an assurance to those partaking of the feast, whose\r\nsuspicious natures nurse queasy appetites, that the haunch has not\r\nbeen pawed by the turnspit in the absence of the housewife's eye, for\r\nthe pleasure of licking his unclean fingers.\"[9]\r\n\r\n  [9] \"History of the Steam-Engine,\" 1825.\r\n\r\nJacob Besson, a Professor of Mathematics and Natural Philosophy at\r\nOrleans, and who was in his time distinguished as a mechanician, and\r\nfor his ingenuity in contriving illustrative models for use in his\r\nlecture-room, left evidence, which Beroaldus collected and published\r\nin 1578,[10] that he had found the spirit of his time sufficiently\r\nenlightened to encourage him to pay great attention to applied\r\nmechanics and to mechanism. There was at this time a marked awakening\r\nof the more intelligent men of the age to the value of practical\r\nmechanics. A scientific tract, published at Orleans in 1569, and\r\nprobably written by Besson, describes very intelligently the\r\ngeneration of steam by the communication of heat to water, and its\r\npeculiar properties.\r\n\r\n  [10] \"Theatrum Instrumentorum et Machinarum, Jacobi Bessoni, cum\r\n  Franc Beroaldus, figuarum declaratione demonstrativa.\" Lugduni,\r\n  1578.\r\n\r\nThe French were now becoming more interested in mechanics and the\r\nallied sciences, and philosophers and literati, of native birth and\r\nimported by the court from other countries, were learning more of the\r\nnature and importance of such studies as have a bearing upon the work\r\nof the engineer and of the mechanic.\r\n\r\nAgostino Ramelli, an Italian of good family, a student and an artist\r\nwhen at leisure, a soldier and an engineer in busier times, was born\r\nand educated at Rome, but subsequently was induced to make his home in\r\nParis. He published a book in 1588,[11] in which he described many\r\nmachines, adapted to various purposes, with a skill that was only\r\nequaled by the accuracy and general excellence of his delineations.\r\nThis work was produced while its author was residing at the French\r\ncapital, supported by a pension which had been awarded him by Henry\r\nIII. as a reward for long and faithful services.\r\n\r\n  [11] \"Le diverse et artificiose machine del Capitano Agostino\r\n  Ramelli, del Ponte della Prefia.\" Paris, 1588.\r\n\r\nThe books of Besson and of Ramelli are the first treatises of\r\nimportance on general machinery, and were, for many years, at once the\r\nsources from which later writers drew the principal portion of their\r\ninformation in relation to machinery, and wholesome stimulants to the\r\nstudy of mechanism. These works contain descriptions of many machines\r\nsubsequently reinvented and claimed as new by other mechanics.\r\n\r\nLeonardo da Vinci, well known as a mathematician, engineer, poet, and\r\npainter, of the sixteenth century, describes, it is said, a steam-gun,\r\nwhich he calls the \"Architonnerre,\" and ascribes to Archimedes. It was\r\na machine composed of copper, and seems to have had considerable\r\npower. It threw a ball weighing a talent. The steam was generated by\r\npermitting water in a closed vessel to fall on surfaces heated by a\r\ncharcoal fire, and by its sudden expansion to eject the ball.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1825, the superintendent of the royal Spanish archives at\r\nSimancas furnished an account which, it was said, had been there\r\ndiscovered of an attempt, made in 1543 by Blasco de Garay, a Spanish\r\nnavy-officer under Charles V., to move a ship by paddle-wheels,\r\ndriven, as was inferred from the account, by a steam-engine.\r\n\r\nIt is impossible to say to how much credit the story is entitled, but,\r\nif true, it was the first attempt, so far as is now known, to make\r\nsteam useful in developing power for practical purposes. Nothing is\r\nknown of the form of the engine employed, it only having been stated\r\nthat a \"vessel of boiling water\" formed a part of the apparatus.\r\n\r\nThe account is, however, in other respects so circumstantial, that it\r\nhas been credited by many; but it is regarded as apocryphal by the\r\nmajority of writers upon the subject. It was published in 1826 by M.\r\nde Navarrete, in Zach's \"Astronomical Correspondence,\" in the form of\r\na letter from Thomas Gonzales, Director of the Royal Archives at\r\nSimancas, Spain.\r\n\r\nIn 1601, Giovanni Battista della Porta, in a work called \"Spiritali,\"\r\ndescribed an apparatus by which the pressure of steam might be made to\r\nraise a column of water. It included the application of the\r\ncondensation of steam to the production of a vacuum into which the\r\nwater would flow.\r\n\r\nPorta is described as a mathematician, chemist, and physicist, a\r\ngentleman of fortune, and an enthusiastic student of science. His home\r\nin Naples was a rendezvous for students, artists, and men of science\r\ndistinguished in every branch. He invented the magic lantern and the\r\ncamera obscura, and described it in his commentary on the\r\n\"Pneumatica.\" In his work,[12] he described this machine for raising\r\nwater, as shown in Fig. 4, which differs from one shown by Hero in the\r\nuse of steam pressure, instead of the pressure of heated air, for\r\nexpelling the liquid.\r\n\r\n  [12] \"Pneumaticorum libri tres,\" etc., 4to. Naples, 1601. \"I Tre\r\n  Libri de' Spiritali.\" Napoli, 1606.\r\n\r\nThe retort, or boiler, is fitted to a tank from which the bent pipe\r\nleads into the external air. A fire being kindled under the retort,\r\nthe steam generated rises to the upper part of the tank, and its\r\npressure on the surface of the water drives it out through the pipe,\r\nand it is then led to any desired height. This was called by Porta an\r\nimproved \"Hero's Fountain,\" and was named his \"Steam Fountain.\" He\r\ndescribed with perfect accuracy the action of condensation in\r\nproducing a vacuum, and sketched an apparatus in which the vacuum thus\r\nsecured was filled by water forced in by the pressure of the external\r\natmosphere. His contrivances were not apparently ever applied to any\r\npractically useful purpose. We have not yet passed out of the age of\r\nspeculation, and are just approaching the period of application. Porta\r\nis, nevertheless, entitled to credit as having proposed an essential\r\nchange in this succession, which begins with Hero, and which did not\r\nend with Watt.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 4.--Porta's Apparatus, A. D. 1601.]\r\n\r\nThe use of steam in Hero's fountain was as necessary a step as,\r\nalthough less striking than, any of the subsequent modifications of\r\nthe machine. In Porta's contrivance, too, we should note particularly\r\nthe separation of the boiler from the \"forcing vessel\"--a plan often\r\nclaimed as original with later inventors, and as constituting a fair\r\nground for special distinction.\r\n\r\nThe rude engraving (Fig. 4) above is copied from the book of Porta,\r\nand shows plainly the boiler mounted above a furnace, from the door of\r\nwhich the flame is seen issuing, and above is the tank containing\r\nwater. The opening in the top is closed by the plug, as shown, and the\r\nsteam issuing from the boiler into the tank near the top, the water\r\nis driven out through the pipe at the left, leading up from the bottom\r\nof the tank.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 5.--De Caus's Apparatus, A. D. 1605.]\r\n\r\nFlorence Rivault, a Gentleman of the Bedchamber to Henry IV., and a\r\nteacher of Louis XIII., is stated by M. Arago, the French philosopher,\r\nto have discovered, as early as 1605, that water confined in a\r\nbomb-shell and there heated would explode the shell, however thick its\r\nwalls might be made. The fact was published in Rivault's treatise on\r\nartillery in 1608. He says: \"The water is converted into air, and its\r\nvaporization is followed by violent explosion.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1615, Salomon de Caus, who had been an engineer and architect under\r\nLouis XIII. of France, and later in the employ of the English Prince\r\nof Wales, published a work at Frankfort, entitled \"Les Raisons des\r\nForces Mouvantes, avec diverses machines tant utile que plaisante,\" in\r\nwhich he illustrated his proposition, \"Water will, by the aid of fire,\r\nmount higher than its source,\" by describing a machine designed to\r\nraise water by the expanding power of steam.\r\n\r\nIn the sketch here given (Fig. 5), and which is copied from the\r\noriginal in \"Les Raisons des Forces Mouvantes,\" etc., _A_ is the\r\ncopper ball containing water; _B_, the cock at the extremity of the\r\npipe, taking water from the bottom, _C_, of the vessel; _D_, the cock\r\nthrough which the vessel is filled. The sketch was probably made by De\r\nCaus's own hand.\r\n\r\nThe machine of De Caus, like that of Porta, thus consisted of a metal\r\nvessel partly filled with water, and in which a pipe was fitted,\r\nleading nearly to the bottom, and open at the top. Fire being applied,\r\nthe steam formed by its elastic force drove the water out through the\r\nvertical pipe, raising it to a height limited only by either the\r\ndesire of the builder or the strength of the vessel.\r\n\r\nIn 1629, Giovanni Branca, of the Italian town of Loretto, described,\r\nin a work[13] published at Rome, a number of ingenious mechanical\r\ncontrivances, among which was a steam-engine (Fig. 6), in which the\r\nsteam, issuing from a boiler, impinged upon the vanes of a horizontal\r\nwheel. This it was proposed to apply to many useful purposes.\r\n\r\n  [13] \"Le Machine deverse del Signior Giovanni Branca, cittadino\r\n  Romano, Ingegniero, Architetto della Sta. Casa di Loretto.\" Roma,\r\n  MDCXXIX.\r\n\r\nAt this time experiments were in progress in England which soon\r\nresulted in the useful application of steam-power to raising water.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 6.--Branca's Steam-Engine, A. D. 1629.]\r\n\r\nA patent, dated January 21, 1630, was granted to David Ramseye[14] by\r\nCharles I., which covered a number of distinct inventions. These were:\r\n\"1. To multiply and make saltpeter in any open field, in fower acres\r\nof ground, sufficient to serve all our dominions. 2. To raise water\r\nfrom low pitts by fire. 3. To make any sort of mills to goe on\r\nstanding waters by continual motion, without help of wind, water, or\r\nhorse. 4. To make all sortes of tapistrie without any weaving-loom, or\r\nwaie ever yet in use in this kingdome. 5. To make boats, shippes, and\r\nbarges to goe against strong wind and tide. 6. To make the earth more\r\nfertile than usual. 7. To raise water from low places and mynes, and\r\ncoal pitts, by a new waie never yet in use. 8. To make hard iron soft,\r\nand likewise copper to be tuffe and soft, which is not in use in this\r\nkingdome. 9. To make yellow waxe white verie speedilie.\"\r\n\r\n  [14] Rymer's \"F[oe]dera,\" Sanderson. Ewbank's \"Hydraulics,\" p. 419.\r\n\r\nThis seems to have been the first authentic reference to the use of\r\nsteam in the arts which has been found in English literature. The\r\npatentee held his grant fourteen years, on condition of paying an\r\nannual fee of L3 6_s._ 8_d._ to the Crown.\r\n\r\nThe second claim is distinct as an application of steam, the language\r\nbeing that which was then, and for a century and a half subsequently,\r\nalways employed in speaking of its use. The steam-engine, in all its\r\nforms, was at that time known as the \"fire-engine.\" It would seem not\r\nat all improbable that the third, fifth, and seventh claims are also\r\napplications of steam-power.\r\n\r\nThomas Grant, in 1632, and Edward Ford, in 1640, also patented\r\nschemes, which have not been described in detail, for moving ships\r\nagainst wind and tide by some new and great force.\r\n\r\nDr. John Wilkins, Bishop of Chester, an eccentric but learned and\r\nacute scholar, described, in 1648, Cardan's smoke-jack, the earlier\r\naeolipiles, and the power of the confined steam, and suggested, in a\r\nhumorous discourse, what he thought to be perfectly feasible--the\r\nconstruction of a flying-machine. He says: \"Might not a 'high\r\npressure' be applied with advantage to move wings as large as those of\r\nthe 'ruck's' or the 'chariot'? The engineer might probably find a\r\ncorner that would do for a coal-station near some of the 'castles'\"\r\n(castles in the air). The reverend wit proposed the application of the\r\nsmoke-jack to the chiming of bells, the reeling of yarn, and to\r\nrocking the cradle.\r\n\r\nBishop Wilkins writes, in 1648 (\"Mathematical Magic\"), of aeolipiles as\r\nfamiliar and useful pieces of apparatus, and describes them as\r\nconsisting \"of some such material as may endure the fire, having a\r\nsmall hole at which they are filled with water, and out of which (when\r\nthe vessels are heated) the air doth issue forth with a strong and\r\nlasting violence.\" \"They are,\" the bishop adds, \"frequently used for\r\nthe exciting and contracting of heat in the melting of glasses or\r\nmetals. They may also be contrived to be serviceable for sundry other\r\npleasant uses, as for the moving of sails in a chimney-corner, the\r\nmotion of which sails may be applied to the turning of a spit, or the\r\nlike.\"\r\n\r\nKircher gives an engraving (\"Mundus Subterraneus\") showing the\r\nlast-named application of the aeolipile; and Erckern (\"Aula\r\nSubterranea,\" 1672) gives a picture illustrating their application to\r\nthe production of a blast in smelting ores. They seem to have been\r\nfrequently used, and in all parts of Europe, during the seventeenth\r\ncentury, for blowing fires in houses, as well as in the practical work\r\nof the various trades, and for improving the draft of chimneys. The\r\nlatter application is revived very frequently by the modern inventor.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--THE PERIOD OF APPLICATION--WORCESTER, PAPIN, AND SAVERY.\r\n\r\nWe next meet with the first instance in which the expansive force of\r\nsteam is supposed to have actually been applied to do important and\r\nuseful work.\r\n\r\nIn 1663, Edward Somerset, second Marquis of Worcester, published a\r\ncurious collection of descriptions of his inventions, couched in\r\nobscure and singular language, and called \"A Century of the Names and\r\nScantlings of Inventions by me already Practised.\"\r\n\r\nOne of these inventions is an apparatus for raising water by steam.\r\nThe description was not accompanied by a drawing, but the sketch here\r\ngiven (Fig. 7) is thought probably to resemble one of his earlier\r\ncontrivances very closely.\r\n\r\nSteam is generated in the boiler _a_, and thence is led into the\r\nvessel _e_, already nearly filled with water, and fitted up like the\r\napparatus of De Caus. It drives the water in a jet out through the\r\npipe _f_. The vessel _e_ is then shut off from the boiler _a_, is\r\nagain filled through the pipe _h_, and the operation is repeated.\r\nStuart thinks it possible that the marquis may have even made an\r\nengine with a piston, and sketches it.[15] The instruments of Porta\r\nand of De Caus were \"steam fountains,\" and were probably applied, if\r\nused at all, merely to ornamental purposes. That of the Marquis of\r\nWorcester was actually used for the purpose of elevating water for\r\npractical purposes at Vauxhall, near London.\r\n\r\n  [15] \"Anecdotes of the Steam-Engine,\" vol. i., p. 61.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Edward Somerset, the Second Marquis of Worcester.]\r\n\r\nHow early this invention was introduced at Raglan Castle by Worcester\r\nis not known, but it was probably not much later than 1628. In 1647\r\nDircks shows the marquis probably to have been engaged in getting out\r\nparts of the later engine which was erected at Vauxhall, obtaining\r\nhis materials from William Lambert, a brass-founder. His patent was\r\nissued in June, 1663.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 7.--Worcester's Steam Fountain, A. D. 1650.]\r\n\r\nWe nowhere find an illustrated description of the machine, or such an\r\naccount as would enable a mechanic to reproduce it in all its details.\r\nFortunately, the cells and grooves (Fig. 9) remaining in the wall of\r\nthe citadel of Raglan Castle indicate the general dimensions and\r\narrangement of the engine; and Dircks, the biographer of the inventor,\r\nhas suggested the form of apparatus shown in the sketch (Fig. 8) as\r\nmost perfectly in accord with the evidence there found, and with the\r\nwritten specifications.\r\n\r\nThe two vessels, _A A'_, are connected by a steam-pipe, _B B'_, with\r\nthe boiler, _C_, behind them. _D_ is the furnace. A vertical\r\nwater-pipe, _E_, is connected with the cold-water vessels, _A A'_, by\r\nthe pipes, _F F'_, reaching nearly to the bottom. Water is supplied by\r\nthe pipes, _G G'_, with valves, _a a'_, dipping into the well or\r\nditch, _H_. Steam from the boiler being admitted to each vessel, _A_\r\nand _A'_, alternately, and there condensing, the vacuum formed permits\r\nthe pressure of the atmosphere to force the water from the well\r\nthrough the pipes, _G_ and _G'_. While one is filling, the steam is\r\nforcing the charge of water from the other up the discharge-pipe, _E_.\r\nAs soon as each is emptied, the steam is shut off from it and turned\r\ninto the other, and the condensation of the steam remaining in the\r\nvessel permits it to fill again. As will be seen presently, this is\r\nsubstantially, and almost precisely, the form of engine of which the\r\ninvention is usually attributed to Savery, a later inventor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 8.--Worcester's Engine, A. D. 1665.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 9.--Wall of Raglan Castle.]\r\n\r\nWorcester never succeeded in forming the great company which he hoped\r\nwould introduce his invention on a scale commensurate with its\r\nimportance, and his fate was that of nearly all inventors. He died\r\npoor and unsuccessful.\r\n\r\nHis widow, who lived until 1681, seemed to have become as confident as\r\nwas Worcester himself that the invention had value, and, long after\r\nhis death, was still endeavoring to secure its introduction, but with\r\nequal non-success. The steam-engine had taken a form which made it\r\ninconceivably valuable to the world, at a time when no more efficient\r\nmeans of raising water was available at the most valuable mines than\r\nhorse-power; but the people, greatly as it was needed, were not yet\r\nsufficiently intelligent to avail themselves of the great boon, the\r\nacceptance of which was urged upon them with all the persistence and\r\nearnestness which characterizes every true inventor.\r\n\r\nWorcester is described by his biographer as having been a learned,\r\nthoughtful, studious, and good man--a Romanist without prejudice or\r\nbigotry, a loyal subject, free from partisan intolerance; as a public\r\nman, upright, honorable, and humane; as a scholar, learned without\r\nbeing pedantic; as a mechanic, patient, skillful, persevering, and of\r\nwonderful ingenuity, and of clear, almost intuitive, apprehension.\r\n\r\nYet, with all these natural advantages, reinforced as they were by\r\nimmense wealth and influence in his earlier life, and by hardly\r\nlessened social and political influence when a large fortune had been\r\nspent in experiment, and after misfortune had subdued his spirits and\r\nleft him without money or a home, the inventor failed to secure the\r\nintroduction of a device which was needed more than any other.\r\nWorcester had attained practical success; but the period of\r\nspeculation was but just closing, and that of the application of steam\r\nhad not quite yet arrived.\r\n\r\nThe second Marquis of Worcester stands on the record as the first\r\nsteam-engine builder, and his death marks the termination of the first\r\nof those periods into which we have divided the history of the growth\r\nof the steam-engine.\r\n\r\nThe \"water-commanding engine,\" as its inventor called it, was the\r\nfirst instance in the history of the steam-engine in which the\r\ninventor is known to have \"reduced his invention to practice.\"\r\n\r\nIt is evident, however, that the invention of the separate boiler,\r\nimportant as it was, had been anticipated by Porta, and does not\r\nentitle the marquis to the honor, claimed for him by many English\r\nauthorities, of being _the_ inventor of the steam-engine. Somerset was\r\nsimply _one_ of those whose works collectively made the steam-engine.\r\n\r\nAfter the time of Worcester, we enter upon a stage of history which\r\nmay properly be termed a period of application; and from this time\r\nforward steam continued to play a more and more important part in\r\nsocial economy, and its influence on the welfare of mankind augmented\r\nwith a rapidly-increasing growth.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge then existing of the immense expansive force of steam,\r\nand the belief that it was destined to submit to the control of man\r\nand to lend its immense power in every department of industry, were\r\nevidently not confined to any one nation. From Italy to Northern\r\nGermany, and from France to Great Britain, the distances, measured in\r\ntime, were vastly greater then than now, when this wonderful genius\r\nhas helped us to reduce weeks to hours; but there existed,\r\nnotwithstanding, a very perfect system of communication, and the\r\nlearning of every centre was promptly radiated to every other. It thus\r\nhappened that, at this time, the speculative study of the steam-engine\r\nwas confined to no part of Europe; inventors and experimenters were\r\nbusy everywhere developing this promising scheme.\r\n\r\nJean Hautefeuille, the son of a French _boulanger_, born at Orleans,\r\nadopted by the Duchess of Bouillon at the suggestion of De Sourdis,\r\nprofiting by the great opportunities offered him, entered the Church,\r\nand became one of the most learned men and greatest mechanicians of\r\nhis time. He studied the many schemes then brought forward by\r\ninventors with the greatest interest, and was himself prolific of new\r\nideas.\r\n\r\nIn 1678, he proposed the use of alcohol in an engine, \"in such a\r\nmanner that the liquid should evaporate and be condensed, _tour a\r\ntour_, without being wasted\"[16]--the first recorded plan, probably,\r\nfor surface-condensation and complete retention of the working-fluid.\r\nHe proposed a gunpowder-engine, of which[17] he described three\r\nvarieties.\r\n\r\n  [16] Stuart's \"Anecdotes.\"\r\n\r\n  [17] \"Pendule Perpetuelle, avec la maniere d'elever d'eau par le\r\n  moyen de la poudre a canon,\" Paris, 1678.\r\n\r\nIn one of these engines he displaced the atmosphere by the gases\r\nproduced by the explosion, and the vacuum thus obtained was utilized\r\nin raising water by the pressure of the air. In the second machine,\r\nthe pressure of the gases evolved by the combustion of the powder\r\nacted directly upon the water, forcing it upward; and in the third\r\ndesign, the pressure of the vapor drove a piston, and this engine was\r\ndescribed as fitted to supply power for many purposes. There is no\r\nevidence that he constructed these machines, however, and they are\r\nhere referred to simply as indicating that all the elements of the\r\nmachine were becoming well known, and that an ingenious mechanic,\r\ncombining known devices, could at this time have produced the\r\nsteam-engine. Its early appearance should evidently have been\r\nanticipated.\r\n\r\nHautefeuille, if we may judge from evidence at hand, was the first to\r\npropose the use of a piston in a heat-engine, and his gunpowder-engine\r\nseems to have been the first machine which would be called a\r\nheat-engine by the modern mechanic. The earlier \"machines\" or\r\n\"engines,\" including that of Hero and those of the Marquis of\r\nWorcester, would rather be denominated \"apparatus,\" as that term is\r\nused by the physicist or the chemist, than a machine or an engine, as\r\nthe terms are used by the engineer.\r\n\r\nHuyghens, in 1680, in a memoir presented to the Academy of Sciences,\r\nspeaks of the expansive force of gunpowder as capable of utilization\r\nas a convenient and portable mechanical power, and indicates that he\r\nhad designed a machine in which it could be applied.\r\n\r\nThis machine of Huyghens is of great interest, not simply because it\r\nwas the first gas-engine and the prototype of the very successful\r\nmodern explosive gas-engine of Otto and Langen, but principally as\r\nhaving been the first engine which consisted of a cylinder and piston.\r\nThe sketch shows its form. It consisted of a cylinder, _A_, a piston,\r\n_B_, two relief-pipes, _C C_, fitted with check-valves and a system of\r\npulleys, _F_, by which the weight is raised. The explosion of the\r\npowder at _H_ expels the air from the cylinder. When the products of\r\ncombustion have cooled, the pressure of the atmosphere is no longer\r\ncounterbalanced by that of air beneath, and the piston is forced down,\r\nraising the weight. The plan was never put in practice, although the\r\ninvention was capable of being made a working and possibly useful\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 10.--Huyghens's Engine, 1680.]\r\n\r\nAt about this period the English attained some superiority over their\r\nneighbors on the Continent in the practical application of science and\r\nthe development of the useful arts, and it has never since been lost.\r\nA sudden and great development of applied science and of the useful\r\narts took place during the reign of Charles II., which is probably\r\nlargely attributable to the interest taken by that monarch in many\r\nbranches of construction and of science. He is said to have been very\r\nfond of mathematics, mechanics, chemistry, and natural history, and to\r\nhave had a laboratory erected, and to have employed learned men to\r\ncarry on experiments and lines of research for his satisfaction. He\r\nwas especially fond of the study and investigation of the arts and\r\nsciences most closely related to naval architecture and navigation,\r\nand devoted much attention to the determination of the best forms of\r\nvessels, and to the discovery of the best kinds of ship-timber. His\r\nbrother, the Duke of York, was equally fond of this study, and was his\r\ncompanion in some of his work.\r\n\r\nGreat as is the influence of the monarch, to-day, in forming the\r\ntastes and habits and in determining the direction of the studies and\r\nlabors of the people, his influence was vastly more potent in those\r\nearlier days; and it may well be believed that the rapid strides taken\r\nby Great Britain from that time were, in great degree, a consequence\r\nof the well-known habits of Charles II., and that the nation, which\r\nhad an exceptional natural aptitude for mechanical pursuits, should\r\nhave been prompted by the example of its king to enter upon such a\r\ncourse as resulted in the early attainment of an advanced position in\r\nall branches of applied science.\r\n\r\nThe appointment, under Sir Robert Moray, the superintendent of the\r\nlaboratory of the king, of Master Mechanic, was conferred upon Sir\r\nSamuel Morland, a nobleman who, in his practical knowledge of\r\nmechanics and in his ingenuity and fruitfulness of invention, was\r\napparently almost equal to Worcester. He was the son of a Berkshire\r\nclergyman, was educated at Cambridge, where he studied mathematics\r\nwith great interest, and entered public life soon after. He served the\r\nParliament under Cromwell, and afterward went to Geneva. He was of a\r\ndecidedly literary turn of mind, and wrote a history of the Piedmont\r\nchurches, which gave him great repute with the Protestant party. He\r\nwas induced subsequently, on the accession of Charles II., to take\r\nservice under that monarch, whose gratitude he had earned by revealing\r\na plot for his assassination.\r\n\r\nHe received his appointment and a baronetcy in 1660, and immediately\r\ncommenced making experiments, partly at his own expense and partly at\r\nthe cost of the royal exchequer, which were usually not at all\r\nremunerative. He built hand fire-engines of various kinds, taking\r\npatents on them, which brought him as small profits as did his work\r\nfor the king, and invented the speaking-trumpet, calculating machines,\r\nand a capstan. His house at Vauxhall was full of curious devices, the\r\nproducts of his own ingenuity.\r\n\r\nHe devoted much attention to apparatus for raising water. His devices\r\nseem to have usually been modifications of the now familiar\r\nforce-pump. They attracted much attention, and exhibitions were made\r\nof them before the king and queen and the court. He was sent to France\r\non business relating to water-works erected for King Charles, and\r\nwhile in Paris he constructed pumps and pumping apparatus for the\r\nsatisfaction of Louis XIV. In his book,[18] published in Paris in\r\n1683, and presented to the king, and an earlier manuscript,[19] still\r\npreserved in the British Museum, Morland shows a perfect familiarity\r\nwith the power of steam. He says, in the latter: \"Water being\r\nevaporated by fire, the vapors require a greater space (about two\r\nthousand times) than that occupied by the water; and, rather than\r\nsubmit to imprisonment, it will burst a piece of ordnance. But, being\r\ncontrolled according to the laws of statics, and, by science, reduced\r\nto the measure of weight and balance, it bears its burden peaceably\r\n(like good horses), and thus may be of great use to mankind,\r\nespecially for the raising of water, according to the following table,\r\nwhich indicates the number of pounds which may be raised six inches,\r\n1,800 times an hour, by cylinders half-filled with water, and of the\r\nseveral diameters and depths of said cylinders.\"\r\n\r\n  [18] \"Elevation des Eaux par toute sorte de Machines reduite a la\r\n  Mesure au Poids et a la Balance, presentee a Sa Majeste Tres\r\n  Chretienne, par le Chevalier Morland, Gentilhomme Ordinaire de la\r\n  Chambre Privee et Maistre de Mechaniques du Roy de la Grande\r\n  Bretagne, 1683.\"\r\n\r\n  [19] \"Les Principes de la Nouvelle Force de Feu, inventee par le\r\n  Chevalier Morland, l'an 1682, et presentee a Sa Majeste Tres\r\n  Chretienne, 1683.\"\r\n\r\nHe then gives the following table, a comparison of which with modern\r\ntables proves Morland to have acquired a very considerable and\r\ntolerably accurate knowledge of the volume and pressure of saturated\r\nsteam:\r\n\r\n  -------------------------+------------------------\r\n         CYLINDERS.        |    POUNDS.\r\n  -----------+-------------+----------------------\r\n    Diameter |    Depth    |    Weight\r\n    in Feet. |   in Feet.  | to be Raised.\r\n  -----------+-------------+----------------------\r\n       1     |      2      |        15\r\n       2     |      4      |       120\r\n       3     |      6      |       405\r\n       4     |      8      |       960\r\n       5     |     10      |     1,876\r\n       6     |     10      |     3,240\r\n  -----------+-------------+----------------------\r\n   Number of cylinders having a diameter of 6 feet\r\n            and a depth of 12 feet.\r\n             |             |\r\n       1     |     12      |     3,240\r\n       2     |     12      |     6,480\r\n       3     |     12      |     9,720\r\n       4     |     12      |    12,960\r\n       5     |     12      |    16,200\r\n       6     |     12      |    19,440\r\n       7     |     12      |    22,680\r\n       8     |     12      |    25,920\r\n       9     |     12      |    29,190\r\n      10     |     12      |    32,400\r\n      20     |     12      |    64,800\r\n      30     |     12      |    97,200\r\n      40     |     12      |   129,600\r\n      50     |     12      |   162,000\r\n      60     |     12      |   194,400\r\n      70     |     12      |   226,800\r\n      80     |     12      |   259,200\r\n      90     |     12      |   291,600\r\n  -----------+-------------+----------------------\r\n\r\nThe rate of enlargement of volume in the conversion of water into\r\nsteam, as given in Morland's book, appears remarkably accurate when\r\ncompared with statements made by other early experimenters.\r\nDesaguliers gave the ratio of volumes at 14,000, and this was accepted\r\nas correct for many years, and until Watt's experiments, which were\r\nquoted by Dr. Robison as giving the ratio at between 1,800 and 1,900.\r\nMorland also states the \"duty\" of his engines in the same manner in\r\nwhich it is stated by engineers to-day.\r\n\r\nMorland must undoubtedly have been acquainted with the work of his\r\ndistinguished contemporary, Lord Worcester, and his apparatus seems\r\nmost likely to have been a modification--perhaps improvement--of\r\nWorcester's engine. His house was at Vauxhall, and the establishment\r\nset up for the king was in the neighborhood. It may be that Morland is\r\nto be credited with greater success in the introduction of his\r\npredecessor's apparatus than the inventor himself.\r\n\r\nDr. Hutton considered this book to have been the earliest account of\r\nthe steam-engine, and accepts the date--1682--as that of the\r\ninvention, and adds, that \"the project seems to have remained obscure\r\nin both countries till 1699, when Savery, who probably knew more of\r\nMorland's invention than he owned, obtained a patent,\" etc. We have,\r\nhowever, scarcely more complete or accurate knowledge of the extent of\r\nMorland's work, and of its real value, than of that of Worcester.\r\nMorland died in 1696, at Hammersmith, not far from London, and his\r\nbody lies in Fulham church.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the minds of many mechanicians were earnestly\r\nat work on this problem--the raising of water by aid of steam.\r\nHitherto, although many ingenious toys, embodying the principles of\r\nthe steam-engine separately, and sometimes to a certain extent\r\ncollectively, had been proposed, and even occasionally constructed,\r\nthe world was only just ready to profit by the labors of inventors in\r\nthis direction.\r\n\r\nBut, at the end of the seventeenth century, English miners were\r\nbeginning to find the greatest difficulty in clearing their shafts of\r\nthe vast quantities of water which they were meeting at the\r\nconsiderable depths to which they had penetrated, and it had become a\r\nmatter of vital importance to them to find a more powerful aid in that\r\nwork than was then available. They were, therefore, by their\r\nnecessities stimulated to watch for, and to be prepared promptly to\r\ntake advantage of, such an invention when it should be offered them.\r\n\r\nThe experiments of Papin, and the practical application of known\r\nprinciples by Savery, placed the needed apparatus in their hands.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Thomas Savery.]\r\n\r\nTHOMAS SAVERY was a member of a well-known family of Devonshire,\r\nEngland, and was born at Shilston, about 1650. He was well educated,\r\nand became a military engineer. He exhibited great fondness for\r\nmechanics, and for mathematics and natural philosophy, and gave much\r\ntime to experimenting, to the contriving of various kinds of\r\napparatus, and to invention. He constructed a clock, which still\r\nremains in the family, and is considered an ingenious piece of\r\nmechanism, and is said to be of excellent workmanship.\r\n\r\nHe invented and patented an arrangement of paddle-wheels, driven by a\r\ncapstan[20] for propelling vessels in calm weather, and spent some\r\ntime endeavoring to secure its adoption by the British Admiralty and\r\nthe Navy Board, but met with no success. The principal objector was\r\nthe Surveyor of the Navy, who dismissed Savery, with a remark which\r\nillustrates a spirit which, although not yet extinct, is less\r\nfrequently met with in the public service now than then: \"What have\r\ninterloping people, that have no concern with us, to do to pretend to\r\ncontrive or invent things for us?\"[21] Savery then fitted his\r\napparatus into a small vessel, and exhibited its operation on the\r\nThames. The invention was never introduced into the navy, however.\r\n\r\n  [20] Harris, \"Lexicon Technicum,\" London, 1710.\r\n\r\n  [21] \"Navigation Improved; or, The Art of Rowing Ships of all rates\r\n  in Calms, with a more Easy, Swift, and Steady Motion, than Oars\r\n  can,\" etc., etc. By Thomas Savery, Gent. London, 1698.\r\n\r\nIt was after this time that Savery became the inventor of a\r\nsteam-engine. It is not known whether he was familiar with the work of\r\nWorcester, and of earlier inventors. Desaguliers[22] states that he\r\nhad read the book of Worcester, and that he subsequently endeavored to\r\ndestroy all evidence of the anticipation of his own invention by the\r\nmarquis by buying up all copies of the century that he could find, and\r\nburning them. The story is scarcely credible. A comparison of the\r\ndrawings given of the two engines exhibits, nevertheless, a striking\r\nresemblance; and, assuming that of the marquis's engine to be correct,\r\nSavery is to be given credit for the finally successful introduction\r\nof the \"semi-omnipotent\" \"water-commanding\" engine of Worcester.\r\n\r\n  [22] \"Experimental Philosophy,\" vol. ii., p. 465.\r\n\r\nThe most important advance in actual construction, therefore, was made\r\nby Thomas Savery. The constant and embarrassing expense, and the\r\nengineering difficulties presented by the necessity of keeping the\r\nBritish mines, and particularly the deep pits of Cornwall, free from\r\nwater, and the failure of every attempt previously made to provide\r\neffective and economical pumping-machinery, were noted by Savery, who,\r\nJuly 25, 1698, patented the design of the first engine which was ever\r\nactually employed in this work. A working-model was submitted to the\r\nRoyal Society of London in 1699, and successful experiments were made\r\nwith it. Savery spent a considerable time in planning his engine and\r\nin perfecting it, and states that he expended large sums of money upon\r\nit.\r\n\r\nHaving finally succeeded in satisfying himself with its operation, he\r\nexhibited a model \"Fire-Engine,\" as it was called in those days,\r\nbefore King William III. and his court, at Hampton Court, in 1698, and\r\nobtained his patent without delay. The title of the patent reads: \"A\r\ngrant to Thomas Savery, Gentl., of the sole exercise of a new\r\ninvention by him invented, for raising of water, and occasioning\r\nmotion to all sorts of mill-works, by the impellant force of fire,\r\nwhich will be of great use for draining mines, serving towns with\r\nwater, and for the working of all sorts of mills, when they have not\r\nthe benefit of water nor constant winds; to hold for 14 years; with\r\nusual clauses.\"\r\n\r\nSavery now went about the work of introducing his invention in a way\r\nwhich is in marked contrast with that usually adopted by the inventors\r\nof that time. He commenced a systematic and successful system of\r\nadvertisement, and lost no opportunity of making his plans not merely\r\nknown, but well understood, even in matters of detail. The Royal\r\nSociety was then fully organized, and at one of its meetings he\r\nobtained permission to appear with his model \"fire-engine\" and to\r\nexplain its operation; and, as the minutes read, \"Mr. Savery\r\nentertained the Society with showing his engine to raise water by the\r\nforce of fire. He was thanked for showing the experiment, which\r\nsucceeded, according to expectation, and was approved of.\" He\r\npresented to the Society a drawing and specifications of his machine,\r\nand \"The Transactions\"[23] contain a copperplate engraving and the\r\ndescription of his model. It consisted of a furnace, _A_, heating a\r\nboiler, _B_, which was connected by pipes, _C C_, with two copper\r\nreceivers, _D D_. There were led from the bottom of these receivers\r\nbranch pipes, _F F_, which turned upward, and were united to form a\r\nrising main, or \"forcing-pipe,\" _G_. From the top of each receiver was\r\nled a pipe, which was turned downward, and these pipes united to form\r\na suction-pipe, which was led down to the bottom of the well or\r\nreservoir from which the water was to be drawn. The maximum lift\r\nallowable was stated at 24 feet.\r\n\r\n  [23] \"Philosophical Transactions, No. 252.\" Weld's \"Royal Society,\"\r\n  vol. i., p. 357. Lowthorp's \"Abridgment,\" vol. i.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 11.--Savery's Model, 1698.]\r\n\r\nThe engine was worked as follows: Steam is raised in the boiler, _B_,\r\nand a cock, _C_, being opened, a receiver, _D_, is filled with steam.\r\nClosing the cock, _C_, the steam condensing in the receiver, a vacuum\r\nis created, and the pressure of the atmosphere forces the water up,\r\nthrough the supply-pipe, from the well into the receiver. Opening the\r\ncock, _C_, again, the check-valve in the suction-pipe at _E_ closes,\r\nthe steam drives the water out through the forcing-pipe, _G_, the\r\nclack-valve, _E_, on that pipe opening before it, and the liquid is\r\nexpelled from the top of the pipe. The valve, _C_, is again closed;\r\nthe steam again condenses, and the engine is worked as before. While\r\none of the two receivers is discharging, the other is filling, as in\r\nthe machine of the Marquis of Worcester, and thus the steam is drawn\r\nfrom the boiler with tolerable regularity, and the expulsion of water\r\ntakes place with similar uniformity, the two systems of receivers and\r\npipes being worked alternately by the single boiler.\r\n\r\nIn another and still simpler little machine,[24] which he erected at\r\nKensington (Fig. 12), the same general plan was adopted, combining a\r\nsuction-pipe, _A_, 16 feet long and 3 inches in diameter; a single\r\nreceiver, _B_, capable of containing 13 gallons; a boiler, _C_, of\r\nabout 40 gallons capacity; a forcing-pipe, _D_, 42 feet high, with the\r\nconnecting pipe and cocks, _E F G_; and the method of operation was as\r\nalready described, except that _surface-condensation_ was employed,\r\nthe cock, _F_, being arranged to shower water from the rising main\r\nover the receiver, as shown. Of the first engine Switzer says: \"I have\r\nheard him say myself, that the very first time he played, it was in a\r\npotter's house at Lambeth, where, though it was a small engine, yet it\r\n(the water) forced its way through the roof, and struck off the tiles\r\nin a manner that surprised all the spectators.\"\r\n\r\n  [24] Bradley, \"New Improvements of Planting and Gardening.\" Switzer,\r\n  \"Hydrostatics,\" 1729.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 12.--Savery's Engine, 1698.]\r\n\r\nThe Kensington engine cost L50, and raised 3,000 gallons per hour,\r\nfilling the receiver four times a minute, and required a bushel of\r\ncoal per day. Switzer remarks: \"It must be noted that this engine is\r\nbut a small one in comparison with many others that are made for\r\ncoal-works; but this is sufficient for any reasonable family, and\r\nother uses required of it in watering all middling gardens.\" He\r\ncautions the operator: \"When you have raised water enough, and you\r\ndesign to leave off working the engine, take away all the fire from\r\nunder the boiler, and open the cock (connected to the funnel) to let\r\nout the steam, which would otherwise, were it to remain confined,\r\nperhaps burst the engine.\"\r\n\r\nWith the intention of making his invention more generally known, and\r\nhoping to introduce it as a pumping-engine in the mining districts of\r\nCornwall, Savery wrote a prospectus for general circulation, which\r\ncontains the earliest account of the later and more effective form of\r\nengine. He entitled his pamphlet \"The Miner's Friend; or, A\r\nDescription of an Engine to raise Water by Fire described, and the\r\nManner of fixing it in Mines, with an Account of the several Uses it\r\nis applicable to, and an Answer to the Objections against it.\" It was\r\nprinted in London in 1702, for S. Crouch, and was distributed among\r\nthe proprietors and managers of mines, who were then finding the flow\r\nof water at depths so great as, in some cases, to bar further\r\nprogress. In many cases, the cost of drainage left no satisfactory\r\nmargin of profit. In one mine, 500 horses were employed raising water,\r\nby the then usual method of using horse-gins and buckets.\r\n\r\nThe approval of the King and of the Royal Society, and the countenance\r\nof the mine-adventurers of England, were acknowledged by the author,\r\nwho addressed his pamphlet to them.\r\n\r\nThe engraving of the engine was reproduced, with the description, in\r\nHarris's \"Lexicon Technicum,\" 1704; in Switzer's \"Hydrostatics,\" 1729;\r\nand in Desaguliers's \"Experimental Philosophy,\" 1744.\r\n\r\nThe sketch which here follows is a neater engraving of the same\r\nmachine. Savery's engine is shown in Fig. 13, as described by Savery\r\nhimself, in 1702, in \"The Miner's Friend.\"\r\n\r\n_L_ is the boiler in which steam is raised, and through the pipes _O\r\nO_ it is alternately let into the vessels _P P_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 13.--Savery's Engine, A. D. 1702.]\r\n\r\nSuppose it to pass into the left-hand vessel first. The valve _M_\r\nbeing closed, and _R_ being opened, the water contained in _P_ is\r\ndriven out and up the pipe _S_ to the desired height, where it is\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nThe valve _R_ is then closed, and the valve in the pipe _O_; the valve\r\n_M_ is next opened, and condensing water is turned upon the exterior\r\nof _P_ by the cock _Y_, leading water from the cistern _X_. As the\r\nsteam contained in _P_ is condensed, forming a vacuum there, a fresh\r\ncharge of water is driven by atmospheric pressure up the pipe _T_.\r\n\r\nMeantime, steam from the boiler has been let into the right-hand\r\nvessel _P_, the cock _W_ having been first closed, and _R_ opened.\r\n\r\nThe charge of water is driven out through the lower pipe and the cock\r\n_R_, and up the pipe _S_ as before, while the other vessel is\r\nrefilling preparatory to acting in its turn.\r\n\r\nThe two vessels are thus alternately charged and discharged, as long\r\nas is necessary.\r\n\r\nSavery's method of supplying his boiler with water was at once simple\r\nand ingenious.\r\n\r\nThe small boiler, _D_, is filled with water from any convenient\r\nsource, as from the stand-pipe, _S_. A fire is then built under it,\r\nand, when the pressure of steam in _D_ becomes greater than in the\r\nmain boiler, _L_, a communication is opened between their lower ends,\r\nand the water passes, under pressure, from the smaller to the larger\r\nboiler, which is thus \"fed\" without interrupting the work. _G_ and _N_\r\nare _gauge-cocks_, by which the height of water in the boilers is\r\ndetermined; they were first adopted by Savery.\r\n\r\nHere we find, therefore, the first really practicable and commercially\r\nvaluable steam-engine. Thomas Savery is entitled to the credit of\r\nhaving been the first to introduce a machine in which the power of\r\nheat, acting through the medium of steam, was rendered generally\r\nuseful.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that Savery, like the Marquis of Worcester, used a\r\nboiler separate from the water-reservoir.\r\n\r\nHe added to the \"water-commanding engine\" of the marquis the system of\r\n_surface-condensation_, by which he was enabled to charge his vessels\r\nwhen it became necessary to refill them; and added, also, the\r\nsecondary boiler, which enabled him to supply the working-boiler with\r\nwater without interrupting its work.\r\n\r\nThe machine was thus made capable of working uninterruptedly for a\r\nperiod of time only limited by its own decay.\r\n\r\nSavery never fitted his boilers with safety-valves, although it was\r\ndone earlier by Papin; and in deep mines he was compelled to make use\r\nof higher pressures than his rudely-constructed boilers could safely\r\nbear.\r\n\r\nSavery's engine was used at a number of mines, and also for supplying\r\nwater to towns; some large estates, country houses, and other private\r\nestablishments, employed them for the same purpose. They did not,\r\nhowever, come into general use among the mines, because, according to\r\nDesaguliers, they were apprehensive of danger from the explosion of\r\nthe boilers or receivers. As Desaguliers wrote subsequently: \"Savery\r\nmade a great many experiments to bring this machine to perfection, and\r\ndid erect several which raised water very well for gentlemen's seats,\r\nbut could not succeed for mines, or supplying towns, where the water\r\nwas to be raised very high and in great quantities; for then the steam\r\nrequired being boiled up to such a strength as to be ready to tear all\r\nthe vessels to pieces.\" \"I have known Captain Savery, at York's\r\nbuildings, to make steam eight or ten times stronger than common air;\r\nand then its heat was so great that it would melt common soft solder,\r\nand its strength so great as to blow open several joints of the\r\nmachine; so that he was forced to be at the pains and charge to have\r\nall his joints soldered with spelter or hard solder.\"\r\n\r\nAlthough there were other difficulties in the application of the\r\nSavery engine to many kinds of work, this was the most serious one,\r\nand explosions did occur with fatal results. The writer just quoted\r\nrelates, in his \"Experimental Philosophy,\" that a man who was ignorant\r\nof the nature of the engine undertook to work a machine which\r\nDesaguliers had provided with a safety-valve to avoid this very\r\ndanger, \"and, having hung the weight at the further end of the\r\nsteelyard, in order to collect more steam in order to make his work\r\nthe quicker, he hung also a very heavy plumber's iron upon the end of\r\nthe steelyard; the consequence proved fatal; for, after some time, the\r\nsteam, not being able, with the safety-cock, to raise up the steelyard\r\nloaded with all this unusual weight, burst the boiler with a great\r\nexplosion, and killed the poor man.\" This is probably the earliest\r\nrecord of a steam-boiler explosion.\r\n\r\nSavery proposed to use his engine for driving mills; but there is no\r\nevidence that he actually made such an application of the machine,\r\nalthough it was afterward so applied by others. The engine was not\r\nwell adapted to the drainage of surface-land, as the elevation of\r\nlarge quantities of water through small heights required great\r\ncapacity of receivers, or compelled the use of several engines for\r\neach case. The filling of the receivers, in such cases, also compelled\r\nthe heating of large areas of cold and wet metallic surfaces by the\r\nsteam at each operation, and thus made the work comparatively wasteful\r\nof fuel. Where used in mines, they were necessarily placed within 30\r\nfeet or less of the lowest level, and were therefore exposed to danger\r\nof submergence whenever, by any accident, the water should rise above\r\nthat level. In many cases this would result in the loss of the engine,\r\nand the mine would remain \"drowned,\" unless another engine should be\r\nprocured to pump it out. Where the mine was deep, the water was forced\r\nby the pressure of steam from the level of the engine-station to the\r\ntop of the lift. This compelled the use of pressures of several\r\natmospheres in many cases; and a pressure of three atmospheres, or\r\nabout 45 pounds per square inch, was considered, in those days, as\r\nabout the maximum pressure allowable. This difficulty was met by\r\nsetting a separate engine at every 60 or 80 feet, and pumping the\r\nwater from one to the other. If any one engine in the set became\r\ndisabled, the pumping was interrupted until that one machine could be\r\nrepaired. The size of Savery's largest boilers was not great, their\r\nmaximum diameter not exceeding two and a half feet. This made it\r\nnecessary to provide several of his engines, usually, for a single\r\nmine, and at each level. The first cost and the expense of repairs\r\nwere exceedingly serious items. The expense and danger, either real or\r\napparent, were thus sufficient to deter many from their use, and the\r\nold method of raising water by horse-power was adhered to.\r\n\r\nThe consumption of fuel with these engines was very great. The steam\r\nwas not generated economically, as the boilers used were of such\r\nsimple forms as only could then be produced, and presented too little\r\nheating surface to secure a very complete transfer of heat from the\r\ngases of combustion to the water within the boiler. This waste in the\r\ngeneration of steam in these uneconomical boilers was followed by\r\nstill more serious waste in its application, without expansion, to the\r\nexpulsion of water from a metallic receiver, the cold and wet sides of\r\nwhich absorbed heat with the greatest avidity. The great mass of the\r\nliquid was not, however, heated by the steam, and was expelled at the\r\ntemperature at which it was raised from below.\r\n\r\nSavery quaintly relates the action of his machine in \"The Miner's\r\nFriend,\" and so exactly, that a better description could scarcely be\r\nasked: \"The steam acts upon the surface of the water in the receiver,\r\nwhich surface only being heated by the steam, it does not condense,\r\nbut the steam gravitates or presses with an elastic quality like air,\r\nand still increasing its elasticity or spring, until it counterpoises,\r\nor rather exceeds, the weight of the column of water in the\r\nforce-pipe, which then it will necessarily drive up that pipe; the\r\nsteam then takes some time to recover its power, but it will at last\r\ndischarge the water out at the top of the pipe. You may see on the\r\noutside of the receiver how the water goes out, as well as if it were\r\ntransparent; for, so far as the steam is contained within the vessel,\r\nit is dry without, and so hot as scarcely to endure the least touch of\r\nthe hand; but so far as the water is inside the vessel, it will be\r\ncold and wet on the outside, where any water has fallen on it; which\r\ncold and moisture vanish as fast as the steam takes the place of the\r\nwater in its descent.\"\r\n\r\nAfter Savery's death, in 1716, several of these engines were erected\r\nin which some improvements were introduced. Dr. Desaguliers, in 1718,\r\nbuilt a Savery engine, in which he avoided some defects which he, with\r\nDr. Gravesande, had noted two years earlier. They had then proposed\r\nto adopt the arrangement of a single receiver which had been used by\r\nSavery himself, as already described, finding, by experiment on a\r\nmodel which they had made for the purpose, that one could be\r\ndischarged three times, while the same boiler would empty two\r\nreceivers but once each. In their arrangement, the steam was shut back\r\nin the boiler while the receiver was filling with water, and a high\r\npressure thus accumulated, instead of being turned into the second\r\nreceiver, and the pressure thus kept comparatively low.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 14.--Papin's Two-Way Cock.]\r\n\r\nIn the engine built in 1718, Desaguliers used a spherical boiler,\r\nwhich he provided with the lever safety-valve already applied by\r\nPapin, and adopted a comparatively small receiver--one-fifth the\r\ncapacity of the boiler--of slender cylindrical form, and attached a\r\npipe leading the water for condensation into the vessel, and effected\r\nits distribution by means of the \"rose,\" or a \"sprinkling-plate,\" such\r\nas is still frequently used in modern engines having jet-condensers.\r\nThis substitution of jet for surface-condensation was of very great\r\nadvantage, securing great promptness in the formation of a vacuum and\r\na rapid filling of the receiver. A \"two-way cock\" admitted steam to\r\nthe receiver, or, being turned the other way, admitted the cold\r\ncondensing water. The dispersion of the water in minute streams or\r\ndrops was a very important detail, not only as securing great\r\nrapidity of condensation, but enabling the designer to employ a\r\ncomparatively small receiver or condenser.\r\n\r\nThe engine is shown in Fig. 15, which is copied from the \"Experimental\r\nPhilosophy\" of Desaguliers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 15.--Engine built by Desaguliers in 1718.]\r\n\r\nThe receiver, _A_, is connected to the boiler, _B_, by a steam-pipe,\r\n_C_, terminating at the two-way cock, _D_; the \"forcing-pipe,\" _E_,\r\nhas at its foot a check-valve, _F_, and the valve _G_ is a similar\r\ncheck at the head of the suction-pipe. _H_ is a strainer, to prevent\r\nthe ingress of chips or other bodies carried to the pipe by the\r\ncurrent; the cap above the valves is secured by a bridle, or stirrup,\r\nand screw, _I_, and may be readily removed to clear the valves or to\r\nrenew them; _K_ is the handle of the two-way cock; _M_ is the\r\ninjection-cock, and is kept open during the working of the engine; _L_\r\nis the chimney-flue; _N_ and _O_ are gauge-cocks fitted to pipes\r\nleading to the proper depths within the boiler, the water-line being\r\nsomewhere between the levels of their lower ends; _P_ is a lever\r\nsafety-valve, as first used on the \"Digester\" of Papin; _R_ is the\r\nreservoir into which the water is pumped; _T_ is the flue, leading\r\nspirally about the boiler from the furnace, _V_, to the chimney; _Y_\r\nis a cock fitted in a pipe through which the rising-main may be filled\r\nfrom the reservoir, should injection-water be needed when that pipe is\r\nempty.\r\n\r\nSeven of these engines were built, the first of which was made for the\r\nCzar of Russia. Its boiler had a capacity of \"five or six hogsheads,\"\r\nand the receiver, \"holding one hogshead,\" was filled and emptied four\r\ntimes a minute. The water was raised \"by suction\" 29 feet, and forced\r\nby steam pressure 11 feet higher.\r\n\r\nAnother engine built at about this time, to raise water 29 feet \"by\r\nsuction,\" and to force it 24 feet higher, made 6 \"strokes\" per minute,\r\nand, when forcing water but 6 or 8 feet, made 8 or 9 strokes per\r\nminute. Twenty-five years later a workman overloaded the safety-valve\r\nof this engine, by placing the weight at the end and then adding \"a\r\nvery heavy plumber's iron.\" The boiler exploded, killing the\r\nattendant.\r\n\r\nDesaguliers says that one of these engines, capable of raising ten\r\ntons an hour 38 feet, in 1728 or 1729, cost L80, exclusive of the\r\npiping.\r\n\r\nBlakely, in 1766, patented an improved Savery engine, in which he\r\nendeavored to avoid the serious loss due to condensation of the steam\r\nby direct contact with the water, by interposing a cushion of oil,\r\nwhich floated upon the water and prevented the contact of the steam\r\nwith the surface of the water beneath it. He also used air for the\r\nsame purpose, sometimes in double receivers, one supported on the\r\nother. These plans did not, however, prove satisfactory.\r\n\r\nRigley, of Manchester, England, soon after erected Savery engines, and\r\napplied them to the driving of mills, by pumping water into\r\nreservoirs, from whence it returned to the wells or ponds from which\r\nit had been raised, turning water-wheels as it descended.\r\n\r\nSuch an arrangement was in operation many years at the works of a Mr.\r\nKiers, St. Pancras, London. It is described in detail, and\r\nillustrated, in Nicholson's \"Philosophical Journal,\" vol. i., p. 419.\r\nIt had a \"wagon-boiler\" 7 feet long, 5 wide, and 5 deep; the wheel was\r\n18 feet in diameter, and drove the lathes and other machinery of the\r\nworks. In this engine Blakely's plan of injecting air was adopted. The\r\ninjection-valve was a clack, which closed automatically when the\r\nvacuum was formed.\r\n\r\nThe engine consumed 6 or 7 bushels of good coals, and made 10 strokes\r\nper minute, raising 70 cubic feet of water 14 feet, and developing\r\nnearly 3 horse-power.\r\n\r\nMany years after Savery's death, in 1774, Smeaton made the first\r\nduty-trials of engines of this kind. He found that an engine having a\r\ncylindrical receiver 16 inches in diameter and 22 feet high,\r\ndischarging the water raised 14 feet above the surface of the water in\r\nthe well, making 12 strokes, and raising 100 cubic feet per minute,\r\ndeveloped 2-2/3 horse-power, and consumed 3 hundredweight of coals in\r\nfour hours. Its duty was, therefore, 5,250,000 pounds raised one foot\r\nper bushel of 84 pounds of coals, or 62,500 \"foot-pounds\" of work per\r\npound of fuel. An engine of slightly greater size gave a duty about 5\r\nper cent. greater.\r\n\r\nWhen Louis XIV. revoked the edict of Nantes, by which Henry IV. had\r\nguaranteed protection to the Protestants of France, the terrible\r\npersecutions at once commenced drove from the kingdom some of its\r\ngreatest men. Among these was Denys Papin.\r\n\r\nIt was at about this time that the influence of the atmospheric\r\npressure on the boiling-point began to be observed, Dr. Hooke having\r\nfound that the boiling-point was a fixed temperature under the\r\nordinary pressure of the atmosphere, and the increase in temperature\r\nand pressure of steam when confined having been shown by Papin with\r\nhis \"Digester.\"\r\n\r\nDenys Papin was of a family which had attached itself to the\r\nProtestant Church; but he was given his education in the school of the\r\nJesuits at Blois, and there acquired his knowledge of mathematics. His\r\nmedical education was given him at Paris, although he probably\r\nreceived his degree at Orleans. He settled in Paris in 1672, with the\r\nintention of practising his profession, and devoted all his spare\r\ntime, apparently, to the study of physics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Denys Papin.]\r\n\r\nMeantime, that distinguished philosopher, Huyghens, the inventor of\r\nthe clock and of the gunpowder-engine, had been induced by the\r\nlinen-draper's apprentice, Colbert, now the most trusted adviser of\r\nthe king, to take up his residence in Paris, and had been made one of\r\nthe earliest members of the Academy of Science, which was founded at\r\nabout that time. Papin became an assistant to Huyghens, and aided him\r\nin his experiments in mechanics, having been introduced by Madame\r\nColbert, who was also a native of Blois. Here he devised several\r\nmodifications of the instruments of Guericke, and printed a\r\ndescription of them.[25] This little book was presented to the\r\nAcademy, and very favorably noticed. Papin now became well known among\r\ncontemporary men of science at Paris, and was well received\r\neverywhere. Soon after, in the year 1675, as stated by the _Journal\r\ndes Savants_, he left Paris and took up his residence in England,\r\nwhere he very soon made the acquaintance of Robert Boyle, the founder,\r\nand of the members of the Royal Society. Boyle speaks of Papin as\r\nhaving gone to England in the hope of finding a place in which he\r\ncould satisfactorily pursue his favorite studies.\r\n\r\n  [25] \"Nouvelles Experiences du Vuide, avec la description des\r\n  Machines qui servent a le faire.\" Paris, 1674.\r\n\r\nBoyle himself had already been long engaged in the study of\r\npneumatics, and had been especially interested in the investigations\r\nwhich had been original with Guericke. He admitted young Papin into\r\nhis laboratory, and the two philosophers worked together at these\r\nattractive problems. It was while working with Boyle that Papin\r\ninvented the double air-pump and the air-gun.\r\n\r\nPapin and his work had now become so well known, and he had attained\r\nso high a position in science, that he was nominated for membership in\r\nthe Royal Academy, and was elected December 16, 1680. He at once took\r\nhis place among the most talented and distinguished of the great men\r\nof his time.\r\n\r\nHe probably invented his \"Digester\" while in England, and it was first\r\ndescribed in a brochure written in English, under the title, \"The New\r\nDigester.\" It was subsequently published in Paris.[26] This was a\r\nvessel, _B_ (Fig. 16), capable of being tightly closed by a screw,\r\n_D_, and a lid, _C_, in which food could be cooked in water raised by\r\na furnace, _A_, to the temperature due to any desired safe pressure of\r\nsteam. The pressure was determined and limited by a weight, _W_, on\r\nthe safety-valve lever, _G_. It is probable that this essential\r\nattachment to the steam-boiler had previously been used for other\r\npurposes; but Papin is given the credit of having first made use of it\r\nto control the pressure of steam.\r\n\r\n  [26] \"La maniere d'amollir les os et de faire cuire toutes sortes de\r\n  viandes,\" etc.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 16.--Papin's Digester, 1680.]\r\n\r\nFrom England, Papin went to Italy, where he accepted membership and\r\nheld official position in the Italian Academy of Science. Papin\r\nremained in Venice two years, and then returned to England. Here, in\r\n1687, he announced one of his inventions, which is just becoming of\r\ngreat value in the arts. He proposed to transmit power from one point\r\nto another, over long distances, by the now well-known \"pneumatic\"\r\nmethod. At the point where power was available, he exhausted a\r\nchamber by means of an air-pump, and, leading a pipe to the distant\r\npoint at which it was to be utilized, there withdrew the air from\r\nbehind a piston, and the pressure of the air upon the latter caused it\r\nto recede into the cylinder, in which it was fitted, raising a weight,\r\nof which the magnitude was proportionate to the size of the piston and\r\nthe degree of exhaustion. Papin was not satisfactorily successful in\r\nhis experiments; but he had created the germ of the modern system of\r\npneumatic transmission of power. His disappointment at the result of\r\nhis efforts to utilize the system was very great, and he became\r\ndespondent, and anxious to change his location again.\r\n\r\nIn 1687 he was offered the chair of Mathematics at Marburg by Charles,\r\nthe Landgrave of Upper Hesse, and, accepting the appointment, went to\r\nGermany. He remained in Germany many years, and continued his\r\nresearches with renewed activity and interest. His papers were\r\npublished in the \"Acta Eruditorum\" at Leipsic, and in the\r\n\"Philosophical Transactions\" at London. It was while at Marburg that\r\nhis papers descriptive of his method of pneumatic transmission of\r\npower were printed.[27]\r\n\r\n  [27] \"Recueil des diverses Pieces touchant quelques Nouvelles\r\n  Machines et autres Sujets Philosophiques,\" M.

Cassel,\r\n  1695.\r\n\r\nIn the \"Acta Eruditorum\" of 1688 he exhibited a practicable plan, in\r\nwhich he exhausted the air from a set of engines or pumps by means of\r\npumps situated at a long distance from the point of application of the\r\npower, and at the place where the prime mover--which was in this case\r\na water-wheel--was erected.\r\n\r\nAfter his arrival at the University of Marburg, Papin exhibited\r\nto his colleagues in the faculty a modification of Huyghens's\r\ngunpowder-engine, in which he had endeavored to obtain a more perfect\r\nvacuum than had Huyghens in the first of these machines. Disappointed\r\nin this, he finally adopted the expedient of employing steam to\r\ndisplace the air, and to produce, by its condensation, the perfect\r\nvacuum which he sought; and he thus produced _the first steam-engine\r\nwith a piston_, and the first piston steam-engine, in which\r\ncondensation was produced to secure a vacuum. It was described in the\r\n\"Acta\" of Leipsic,[28] in June, 1690, under the title, \"Nova Methodus\r\nad vires motrices validissimas leri pretio comparandeo\" (\"A New Method\r\nof securing cheaply Motive Power of considerable Magnitude\"). He\r\ndescribes first the gunpowder-engine, and continues by stating that,\r\n\"until now, all experiments have been unsuccessful; and after the\r\ncombustion of the exploded powder, there always remains in the\r\ncylinder about one-fifth its volume of air.\" He says that he has\r\nendeavored to arrive by another route at the same end; and \"as, by a\r\nnatural property of water, a small quantity of this liquid, vaporized\r\nby the action of heat, acquires an elasticity like that of the air,\r\nand returns to the liquid state again on cooling, without retaining\r\nthe least trace of its elastic force,\" he thought that it would be\r\neasy to construct machines in which, \"by means of a moderate heat, and\r\nwithout much expense,\" a more perfect vacuum could be produced than\r\ncould be secured by the use of gunpowder.\r\n\r\n  [28] \"Acta Eruditorum,\" Leipsic, 1690.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 17.--Papin's Engine.]\r\n\r\nThe first machine of Papin (Fig. 17) was very similar to the\r\ngunpowder-engine already described as the invention of Huyghens. In\r\nplace of gunpowder, a small quantity of water is placed at the bottom\r\nof the cylinder, _A_; a fire is built beneath it, \"the bottom being\r\nmade of very thin metal,\" and the steam formed soon raises the piston,\r\n_B_, to the top, where a latch, _E_, engaging a notch in the\r\npiston-rod, _H_, holds it up until it is desired that it shall drop.\r\nThe fire being removed, the steam condenses, and a vacuum is formed\r\nbelow the piston, and the latch, _E_, being disengaged, the piston is\r\ndriven down by the superincumbent atmosphere and raises the weight\r\nwhich has been, meantime, attached to a rope, _L_, passing from the\r\npiston-rod over pulleys, _T T_. The machine had a cylinder two and a\r\nhalf inches in diameter, and raised 60 pounds once a minute; and Papin\r\ncalculated that a machine of a little more than two feet diameter of\r\ncylinder and of four feet stroke would raise 8,000 pounds four feet\r\nper minute--i. e., that it would yield about one horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe inventor claimed that this new machine would be found useful in\r\nrelieving mines from water, in throwing bombs, in ship-propulsion,\r\nattaching revolving paddles--i. e., paddle-wheels--to the sides of the\r\nvessel, which wheels were to be driven by several of his engines, in\r\norder to secure continuous motion, the piston-rods being fitted with\r\nracks which were to engage ratchet-wheels on the paddle-shafts.\r\n\r\n\"The principal difficulty,\" he says, answering anticipated objections,\r\n\"is that of making these large cylinders.\"\r\n\r\nIn a reprint describing his invention, in 1695, Papin gives a\r\ndescription of a \"newly-invented furnace,\" a kind of fire-box\r\nsteam-boiler, in which the fire, completely surrounded by water, makes\r\nsteam so rapidly that his engine could be driven at the rate of four\r\nstrokes per minute by the steam supplied by it.\r\n\r\nPapin also proposed the use of a peculiar form of furnace with this\r\nengine, which, embodying as it does some suggestions that very\r\nprobably have since been attributed to later inventors, deserves\r\nspecial notice. In this furnace, Papin proposed to burn his fuel on a\r\ngrate within a furnace arranged with a _down-draught_, the air\r\nentering above the grate, passing _down_ through the fire, and from\r\nthe ash-pit through a side flue to the chimney. In starting the fire,\r\nthe coal was laid on the grate, covered with wood, and the latter was\r\nignited, the flame, passing downward through the coal, igniting that\r\nin turn, and, as claimed by Papin, the combustion was complete, and\r\nthe formation of smoke was entirely prevented. He states, in \"Acta\r\nEruditorum,\" that the heat was intense, the saving of fuel very great,\r\nand that the only difficulty was to find a refractory material which\r\nwould withstand the high temperature attained.\r\n\r\nThis is the first fire-box and flue boiler of which we have record.\r\nThe experiment is supposed to have led Papin to suggest the use of a\r\nhot-blast, as practised by Neilson more than a century later, for\r\nreducing metals from their ores.\r\n\r\nPapin made another boiler having a flue winding through the\r\nwater-space, and presenting a heating surface of nearly 80 square\r\nfeet. The flue had a length of 24 feet, and was about 10 inches\r\nsquare. It is not stated what were the maximum pressures carried on\r\nthese boilers; but it is known that Papin had used very high pressures\r\nin his digesters--probably between 1,200 and 1,500 pounds per square\r\ninch.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1705, Leibnitz, then visiting England, had seen a Savery\r\nengine, and, on his return, described it to Papin, sending him a\r\nsketch of the machine. Papin read the letter and exhibited the sketch\r\nto the Landgrave of Hesse, and Charles at once urged him to endeavor\r\nto perfect his own machine, and to continue the researches which he\r\nhad been intermittently pursuing since the earlier machine had been\r\nexhibited in public.\r\n\r\nIn a small pamphlet printed at Cassel in 1707,[29] Papin describes a\r\nnew form of engine, in which he discards the original plan of a\r\nmodified Huyghens engine, with tight-fitting piston and cylinder,\r\nraising its load by indirect action, and makes a modified Savery\r\nengine, which he calls the \"Elector's Engine,\" in honor of his patron.\r\nThis is the engine shown in the engraving, and as proposed to be used\r\nby him in turning a water-wheel.\r\n\r\n  [29] \"Nouvelle maniere d'elever l'Eau par la Force du Feu, mis en\r\n  Lumiere,\" par D. Papin. Cassel, 1707.\r\n\r\nThe sketch is that given by the inventor in his memoir. It consists\r\n(Fig. 18) of a steam-boiler, _a_, from which steam is led through the\r\ncock, _c_, to the working cylinder, _n n_. The water beneath the\r\nfloating-piston, _h_, which latter serves simply as a cushion to\r\nprotect the steam from sudden condensation or contact with the water,\r\nis forced into the vessel _r r_, which is a large air-chamber, and\r\nwhich serves to render the outflow of water comparatively uniform, and\r\nthe discharge occurs by means of the pipe _q_, from which the water\r\nrises to the desired height. A fresh supply of water is introduced\r\nthrough the funnel _k_, after condensation of the steam in _n n_, and\r\nthe operation of expulsion is repeated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 18.--Papin's Engine and Water-Wheel, A. D. 1707.]\r\n\r\nThis machine is evidently a retrogression, and Papin, after having\r\nearned the honor of having invented the first steam-engine of the\r\ntypical form which has since become so universally applied, forfeited\r\nthat credit by his evident ignorance of its superiority over existing\r\ndevices, and by attempting unsuccessfully to perfect the inferior\r\ndevice of another inventor.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Papin made an attempt to apply the steam-engine to the\r\npropulsion of vessels, the account of which will be given in the\r\nchapter on Steam-Navigation.\r\n\r\nAgain disappointed, Papin once more visited England, to renew his\r\nacquaintance with the _savans_ of the Royal Society; but Boyle had\r\ndied during the period which Papin had spent in Germany, and the\r\nunhappy and disheartened inventor and philosopher died in 1810,\r\nwithout having seen any one of his many devices and ingenious\r\ninventions a practical success.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER II.\r\n\r\n_THE STEAM-ENGINE AS A TRAIN OF MECHANISM._\r\n\r\n  \"The introduction of new Inventions seemeth to be the very chief of\r\n  all human Actions. The Benefits of new Inventions may extend to all\r\n  Mankind universally; but the Good of political Achievements can\r\n  respect but some particular Cantons of Men; these latter do not\r\n  endure above a few Ages, the former forever. Inventions make all Men\r\n  happy, without either Injury or Damage to any one single Person.\r\n  Furthermore, new Inventions are, as it were, new Erections and\r\n  Imitations of God's own Works.\"--BACON.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE MODERN TYPE, AS DEVELOPED BY NEWCOMEN, BEIGHTON, AND SMEATON.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the eighteenth century every element of the modern\r\ntype of steam-engine had been separately invented and practically\r\napplied. The character of atmospheric pressure, and of the pressure of\r\ngases, had become understood. The nature of a vacuum was known, and\r\nthe method of obtaining it by the displacement of the air by steam,\r\nand by the condensation of the vapor, was understood. The importance\r\nof utilizing the power of steam, and the application of condensation\r\nin the removal of atmospheric pressure, was not only recognized, but\r\nhad been actually and successfully attempted by Morland, Papin, and\r\nSavery.\r\n\r\nMechanicians had succeeded in making steam-boilers capable of\r\nsustaining any desired or any useful pressure, and Papin had shown how\r\nto make them comparatively safe by the attachment of the\r\nsafety-valve. They had made steam-cylinders fitted with pistons, and\r\nhad used such a combination in the development of power.\r\n\r\nIt now only remained for the engineer to combine known forms of\r\nmechanism in a practical machine which should be capable of\r\neconomically and conveniently utilizing the power of steam through the\r\napplication of now well-understood principles, and by the intelligent\r\ncombination of physical phenomena already familiar to scientific\r\ninvestigators.\r\n\r\nEvery essential fact and every vital principle had been learned, and\r\nevery one of the needed mechanical combinations had been successfully\r\neffected. It was only requisite that an inventor should appear,\r\ncapable of perceiving that these known facts and combinations of\r\nmechanism, properly illustrated in a working machine, would present to\r\nthe world its greatest physical blessing.\r\n\r\nThe defects of the simple engines constructed up to this time have\r\nbeen noted as each has been described. None of them could be depended\r\nupon for safe, economical, and continuous work. Savery's was the most\r\nsuccessful of all. But the engine of Savery, even with the\r\nimprovements of Desaguliers, was unsafe where most needed, because of\r\nthe high pressures necessarily carried in its boilers when pumping\r\nfrom considerable depths; it was uneconomical, in consequence of the\r\ngreat loss of heat in its forcing-cylinders when the hot steam was\r\nsurrounded at its entrance by colder bodies; it was slow in operation,\r\nof great first cost, and expensive in first cost and in repairs, as\r\nwell as in its operation. It could not be relied upon to do its work\r\nuninterruptedly, and was thus in many respects a very unsatisfactory\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nThe man who finally effected a combination of the elements of the\r\nmodern steam-engine, and produced a machine which is unmistakably a\r\ntrue engine--i. e., a train of mechanism consisting of several\r\nelementary pieces combined in a train capable of transmitting a force\r\napplied at one end and of communicating it to the resistance to be\r\novercome at the other end--was THOMAS NEWCOMEN, an \"iron-monger\" and\r\nblacksmith of Dartmouth, England. The engine invented by him, and\r\nknown as the \"Atmospheric Steam-Engine,\" is the first of an entirely\r\nnew type.\r\n\r\nThe old type of engine--the steam-engine as a simple machine--had been\r\ngiven as great a degree of perfection, by the successive improvements\r\nof Worcester, Savery, and Desaguliers, as it was probably capable of\r\nattaining by any modification of its details. The next step was\r\nnecessarily a complete change of type; and to effect such a change, it\r\nwas only necessary to combine devices already known and successfully\r\ntried.\r\n\r\nBut little is known of the personal history of Newcomen. His position\r\nin life was humble, and the inventor was not then looked upon as an\r\nindividual of even possible importance in the community. He was\r\nconsidered as one of an eccentric class of schemers, and of an order\r\nwhich, concerning itself with mechanical matters, held the lowest\r\nposition in the class.\r\n\r\nIt is supposed that Savery's engine was perfectly well known to\r\nNewcomen, and that the latter may have visited Savery at his home in\r\nModbury, which was but fifteen miles from the residence of Newcomen.\r\nIt is thought, by some biographers of these inventors, that Newcomen\r\nwas employed by Savery in making the more intricate forgings of his\r\nengine. Harris, in his \"Lexicon Technicum,\" states that drawings of\r\nthe engine of Savery came into the hands of Newcomen, who made a model\r\nof the machine, set it up in his garden, and then attempted its\r\nimprovement; but Switzer says that Newcomen \"was as early in his\r\ninvention as Mr. Savery was in his.\"\r\n\r\nNewcomen was assisted in his experiments by John Calley, who, with\r\nhim, took out the patent. It has been stated that a visit to Cornwall,\r\nwhere they witnessed the working of a Savery engine, first turned\r\ntheir attention to the subject; but a friend of Savery has stated\r\nthat Newcomen was as early with his general plans as Savery.\r\n\r\nAfter some discussion with Calley, Newcomen entered into\r\ncorrespondence with Dr. Hooke, proposing a steam-engine to consist of\r\na _steam-cylinder containing a piston similar to that of Papin's, and\r\nto drive a separate pump_, similar to those generally in use where\r\nwater was raised by horse or wind power. Dr. Hooke advised and argued\r\nstrongly against their plan, but, fortunately, the obstinate belief of\r\nthe unlearned mechanics was not overpowered by the disquisitions of\r\ntheir distinguished correspondent, and Newcomen and Calley attempted\r\nan engine on their peculiar plan. This succeeded so well as to induce\r\nthem to continue their labors, and, in 1705, to patent,[30] in\r\ncombination with Savery--who held the exclusive right to practise\r\nsurface-condensation, and who induced them to allow him an interest\r\nwith them--an engine combining a steam-cylinder and piston,\r\nsurface-condensation, a separate boiler, and separate pumps.\r\n\r\n  [30] It has been denied that a patent was issued, but there is no\r\n  doubt that Savery claimed and received an interest in the new\r\n  engine.\r\n\r\nIn the atmospheric-engine, as first designed, the slow process of\r\ncondensation by the application of the condensing water to the\r\nexterior of the cylinder, to produce the vacuum, caused the strokes of\r\nthe engine to take place at very long intervals. An improvement was,\r\nhowever, soon effected, which immensely increased the rapidity of\r\ncondensation. A jet of water was thrown directly _into_ the cylinder,\r\nthus effecting for the Newcomen engine just what Desaguliers had done\r\nfor the Savery engine previously. As thus improved, the Newcomen\r\nengine is shown in Fig. 19.\r\n\r\nHere _b_ is the boiler. Steam passes from it through the cock, _d_,\r\nand up into the cylinder, _a_, equilibrating the pressure of the\r\natmosphere, and allowing the heavy pump-rod, _k_, to fall, and, by\r\nthe greater weight acting through the beam, _i i_, to raise the\r\npiston, _s_, to the position shown. The rod _m_ carries a\r\ncounterbalance, if needed. The cock _d_ being shut, _f_ is then\r\nopened, and a jet of water from the reservoir, _g_, enters the\r\ncylinder, producing a vacuum by the condensation of the steam. The\r\npressure of the air above the piston now forces it down, again raising\r\nthe pump-rods, and thus the engine works on indefinitely.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 19.--Newcomen's Engine, A. D. 1705.]\r\n\r\nThe pipe _h_ is used for the purpose of keeping the upper side of the\r\npiston covered with water, to prevent air-leaks--a device of Newcomen.\r\nTwo gauge-cocks, _c c_, and a safety-valve, _N_, are represented in\r\nthe figure, but it will be noticed that the latter is quite different\r\nfrom the now usual form. Here, the pressure used was hardly greater\r\nthan that of the atmosphere, and the weight of the valve itself was\r\nordinarily sufficient to keep it down. The condensing water, together\r\nwith the water of condensation, flows off through the open pipe _p_.\r\nNewcomen's first engine made 6 or 8 strokes a minute; the later and\r\nimproved engines made 10 or 12.\r\n\r\nThe steam-engine has now assumed a form that somewhat resembles the\r\nmodern machine.\r\n\r\nThe Newcomen engine is seen at a glance to have been a combination of\r\nearlier ideas. It was the engine of Huyghens, with its cylinder and\r\npiston as improved by Papin, by the substitution of steam for the\r\ngases generated by the explosion of gunpowder; still further improved\r\nby Newcomen and Calley by the addition of the method of condensation\r\nused in the Savery engine. It was further modified, with the object of\r\napplying it directly to the working of the pumps of the mines by the\r\nintroduction of the overhead beam, from which the piston was suspended\r\nat one end and the pump-rod at the other.\r\n\r\nThe advantages secured by this combination of inventions were many and\r\nmanifest. The piston not only gave economy by interposing itself\r\nbetween the impelling and the resisting fluid, but, by affording\r\nopportunity to make the area of piston as large as desired, it enabled\r\nNewcomen to use any convenient pressure and any desired proportions\r\nfor any proposed lift. The removal of the water to be lifted from the\r\nsteam-engine proper and handling it with pumps, was an evident cause\r\nof very great economy of steam.\r\n\r\nThe disposal of the water to be raised in this way also permitted the\r\noperations of condensation of steam, and the renewal of pressure on\r\nthe piston, to be made to succeed each other with rapidity, and\r\nenabled the inventor to choose, unhampered, the device for securing\r\npromptly the action of condensation.\r\n\r\nDesaguliers, in his account of the introduction of the engine of\r\nNewcomen, says that, with his coadjutor Calley, he \"made several\r\nexperiments in private about the year 1710, and in the latter end of\r\nthe year 1711 made proposals to drain the water of a colliery at\r\nGriff, in Warwickshire, where the proprietors employed 500 horses, at\r\nan expense of L900 a year; but, their invention not meeting with the\r\nreception they expected, in March following, through the acquaintance\r\nof Mr. Potter, of Bromsgrove, in Worcestershire, they bargained to\r\ndraw water for Mr. Back, of Wolverhampton, where, after a great many\r\nlaborious attempts, they did make the engine work; but, not being\r\neither philosophers to understand the reason, or mathematicians enough\r\nto calculate the powers and proportions of the parts, they very\r\nluckily, by accident, found what they sought for.\r\n\r\n\"They were at a loss about the pumps, but, being so near Birmingham,\r\nand having the assistance of so many admirable and ingenious workmen,\r\nthey came, about 1712, to the method of making the pump-valves,\r\nclacks, and buckets, whereas they had but an imperfect notion of them\r\nbefore. One thing is very remarkable: as they were at first working,\r\nthey were surprised to see the engine go several strokes, and very\r\nquick together, when, after a search, they found a hole in the piston,\r\nwhich let the cold water in to condense the steam in the inside of the\r\ncylinder, whereas, before, they had always done it on the outside.\r\nThey used before to work with a buoy to the cylinder, inclosed in a\r\npipe, which buoy rose when the steam was strong and opened the\r\ninjection, and made a stroke; thereby they were only capable of giving\r\n6, 8, or 10 strokes in a minute, till a boy, named Humphrey Potter, in\r\n1713, who attended the engine, added (what he called a _scoggan_) a\r\ncatch, that the beam always opened, and then it would go 15 or 16\r\nstrokes a minute. But, this being perplexed with catches and strings,\r\nMr. Henry Beighton, in an engine he had built at Newcastle-upon-Tyne\r\nin 1718, took them all away but the beam itself, and supplied them in\r\na much better manner.\"\r\n\r\nIn illustration of the application of the Newcomen engine to the\r\ndrainage of mines, Farey describes a small machine, of which the pump\r\nis 8 inches in diameter, and the lift 162 feet. The column of water\r\nto be raised weighed 3,535 pounds. The steam-piston was made 2\r\nfeet in diameter, giving an area of 452 square inches. The net\r\nworking-pressure was assumed at 10-3/4 pounds per square inch; the\r\ntemperature of the water of condensation and of uncondensed vapor\r\nafter the entrance of the injection-water being usually about 150 deg.\r\nFahr. This gave an excess of pressure on the steam-side of 1,324\r\npounds, the total pressure on the piston being 4,859 pounds. One-half\r\nof this excess is counterweighted by the pump-rods, and by weight on\r\nthat end of the beam; and the weight, 662 pounds, acting on each side\r\nalternately as a surplus, produced the requisite rapidity of movement\r\nof the machine. This engine was said to make 15 strokes per minute,\r\ngiving a speed of piston of 75 feet per minute, and the power exerted\r\nusefully was equivalent to 265,125 pounds raised one foot high per\r\nminute. As the horse-power is equivalent to 33,000 \"foot-pounds\" per\r\nminute, the engine was of 265125/33000 = 8.034--almost exactly 8\r\nhorse-power.\r\n\r\nIt is instructive to contrast this estimate with that made for a\r\nSavery engine doing the same work. The latter would have raised the\r\nwater about 26 feet in its \"suction-pipe,\" and would then have forced\r\nit, by the direct pressure of steam, the remaining distance of 136\r\nfeet; and the steam-pressure required would have been nearly 60 pounds\r\nper square inch. With this high temperature and pressure, the waste of\r\nsteam by condensation in the forcing-vessels would have been so great\r\nthat it would have compelled the adoption of two engines of\r\nconsiderable size, each lifting the water one-half the height, and\r\nusing steam of about 25 pounds pressure. Potter's rude valve-gear was\r\nsoon improved by Henry Beighton, in an engine which that talented\r\nengineer erected at Newcastle-upon-Tyne in 1718, and in which he\r\nsubstituted substantial materials for the cords, as in Fig. 20.\r\n\r\nIn this sketch, _r_ is a plug-tree, plug-rod, or plug-frame, as it is\r\nvariously called, suspended from the great beam, with which it rises\r\nand falls, bringing the pins _p_ and _k_, at the proper moment, in\r\ncontact with the handles _k k_ and _n n_ of the valves, moving them in\r\nthe proper direction and to the proper extent. A lever safety-valve is\r\nhere used, at the suggestion, it is said, of Desaguliers. The piston\r\nwas packed with leather or with rope, and lubricated with tallow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 20.--Beighton's Valve-Gear, A. D. 1718.]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of Beighton, the atmospheric engine of Newcomen\r\nretained its then standard form for many years, and came into\r\nextensive use in all the mining districts, particularly in Cornwall,\r\nand was also applied occasionally to the drainage of wet lands, to the\r\nsupply of water to towns, and it was even proposed by Hulls to be used\r\nfor ship-propulsion.\r\n\r\nThe proportions of the engines had been determined in a hap-hazard\r\nway, and they were in many cases very unsafe. John Smeaton, the most\r\ndistinguished engineer of his time, finally, in 1769, experimentally\r\ndetermined proper proportions, and built several of these engines of\r\nvery considerable size. He built his engines with steam-cylinders of\r\ngreater length of stroke than had been customary, and gave them such\r\ndimensions as, by giving a greater excess of pressure on the\r\nsteam-side, enabled him to obtain a greatly-increased speed of piston.\r\nThe first of his new style of engine was erected at Long Benton, near\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, in 1774.\r\n\r\nFig. 21[31] illustrates its principal characteristic features. The\r\nboiler is not shown.\r\n\r\n  [31] A fac-simile of a sketch in Galloway's \"On the Steam-Engine,\"\r\n  etc.\r\n\r\nThe steam is led to the engine through the pipe, _C_, and is regulated\r\nby turning the cock in the receiver, _D_, which connects with the\r\nsteam-cylinder by the pipe, _E_, which latter pipe rises a little way\r\nabove the bottom of the cylinder, _F_, in order that it may not drain\r\noff the injection-water into the steam-pipe and receiver.\r\n\r\nThe steam-cylinder, about ten feet in length, is fitted with a\r\ncarefully-made piston, _G_, having a flanch rising four or five inches\r\nand extending completely around its circumference, and nearly in\r\ncontact with the interior surface of the cylinder. Between this flanch\r\nand the cylinder is driven a \"packing\" of oakum, which is held in\r\nplace by weights; this prevents the leakage of air, water, or steam,\r\npast the piston, as it rises and falls in the cylinder at each stroke\r\nof the engine. The chain and piston-rod connect the piston to the\r\nbeam, _I I_. The arch-heads at each end of the beam keep the chains of\r\nthe piston-rod and the pump-rods perpendicular and in line.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 21.--Smeaton's Newcomen Engine.]\r\n\r\nA \"jack-head\" pump, _N_, is driven by a small beam deriving its motion\r\nfrom the plug-rod at _g_, raises the water required for condensing\r\nthe steam, and keeps the cistern, _O_, supplied. This \"jack-head\r\ncistern\" is sufficiently elevated to give the water entering the\r\ncylinder the velocity requisite to secure prompt condensation. A\r\nwaste-pipe carries away any surplus water. The injection-water is led\r\nfrom the cistern by the pipe, _P P_, which is two or three inches in\r\ndiameter, and the flow of water is regulated by the injection-cock,\r\n_r_. The cap at the end, _d_, is pierced with several holes, and the\r\nstream thus divided rises in jets when admitted, and, striking the\r\nlower side of the piston, the spray thus produced very rapidly\r\ncondenses the steam, and produces a vacuum beneath the piston. The\r\nvalve, _e_, on the upper end of the injection-pipe, is a check-valve,\r\nto prevent leakage into the engine when the latter is not in\r\noperation. The little pipe, _f_, supplies water to the upper side of\r\nthe piston, and, keeping it flooded, prevents the entrance of air when\r\nthe packing is not perfectly tight.\r\n\r\nThe \"working-plug,\" or plug-rod, _Q_, is a piece of timber slit\r\nvertically, and carrying pins which engage the handles of the valves,\r\nopening and closing them at the proper times. The steam-cock, or\r\nregulator, has a handle, _h_, by which it is moved. The iron rod, _i\r\ni_, or spanner, gives motion to the handle, _h_.\r\n\r\nThe vibrating lever, _k l_, called the _Y_, or the \"tumbling-bob,\"\r\nmoves on the pins, _m n_, and is worked by the levers, _o p_, which in\r\nturn are moved by the plug-tree. When _o_ is depressed, the loaded\r\nend, _k_, is given the position seen in the sketch, and the leg _l_ of\r\nthe _Y_ strikes the spanner, _i i_, and, opening the steam-valve, the\r\npiston at once rises as steam enters the cylinder, until another pin\r\non the plug-rod raises the piece, _P_, and closes the regulator again.\r\nThe lever, _q r_, connects with the injection-cock, and is moved,\r\nwhen, as the piston rises, the end, _q_, is struck by a pin on the\r\nplug-rod, and the cock is opened and a vacuum produced. The cock is\r\nclosed on the descent of the plug-tree with the piston. An\r\neduction-pipe, _R_, fitted with a clock, conveys away the water in the\r\ncylinder at the end of each down-stroke; the water thus removed is\r\ncollected in the hot-well, _S_, and is used as feed-water for the\r\nboiler, to which it is conveyed by the pipe _T_. At each down-stroke,\r\nwhile the water passes out through _R_, the air which may have\r\ncollected in the cylinder is driven out through the \"snifting-valve,\"\r\n_s_. The steam-cylinder is supported on strong beams, _t t_; it has\r\naround its upper edge a guard, _v_, of lead, which prevents the\r\noverflow of the water on the top of the piston. The excess of this\r\nwater flows away to the hot-well through the pipe _W_.\r\n\r\nCatch-pins, _x_, are provided, to prevent the beam descending too far\r\nshould the engine make too long a stroke; two wooden springs, _y y_,\r\nreceive the blow. The great beam is carried on sectors, _z z_, to\r\ndiminish losses by friction.\r\n\r\nThe boilers of Newcomen's earlier engines were made of copper where in\r\ncontact with the products of combustion, and their upper parts were of\r\nlead. Subsequently, sheet-iron was substituted. The steam-space in the\r\nboiler was made of 8 or 10 times the capacity of the cylinder of the\r\nengine. Even in Smeaton's time, a chimney-damper was not used, and the\r\nsupply of steam was consequently very variable. In the earlier\r\nengines, the cylinder was placed on the boiler; afterward, they were\r\nplaced separately, and supported on a foundation of masonry. The\r\ninjection or \"jack-head\" cistern was placed from 12 to 30 feet above\r\nthe engine, the velocity due the greater altitude being found to give\r\nthe most perfect distribution of the water and the promptest\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 22.--Boiler of Newcomen's Engine, 1768.]\r\n\r\nSmeaton covered the lower side of his steam-pistons with wooden plank\r\nabout 2-1/4 inches thick, in order that it should absorb and waste\r\nless heat than when the iron was directly exposed to the steam. Mr.\r\nBeighton was the first to use the water of condensation for feeding\r\nthe boiler, taking it directly from the eduction-pipe, or the\r\n\"hot-well.\" Where only a sufficient amount of pure water could be\r\nobtained for feeding the boiler, and the injection-water was \"hard,\"\r\nMr. Smeaton applied a heater, immersed in the hot-well, through which\r\nthe feed passed, absorbing heat from the water of condensation _en\r\nroute_ to the boiler. Farey first proposed the use of the\r\n\"coil-heater\"--a pipe, or \"worm,\" which, forming a part of the\r\nfeed-pipe, was set in the hot-well.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1743, the metal used for the cylinders was cast-iron. The\r\nearlier engines had been fitted with brass cylinders. Desaguliers\r\nrecommended the iron cylinders, as being smoother, thinner, and as\r\nhaving less capacity for heat than those of brass.\r\n\r\nIn a very few years after the invention of Newcomen's engine it had\r\nbeen introduced into nearly all large mines in Great Britain; and many\r\nnew mines, which could not have been worked at all previously, were\r\nopened, when it was found that the new machine could be relied upon to\r\nraise the large quantities of water to be handled. The first engine in\r\nScotland was erected in 1720 at Elphinstone, in Stirlingshire. One was\r\nput up in Hungary in 1723.\r\n\r\nThe first mine-engine, erected in 1712 at Griff, was 22 inches in\r\ndiameter, and the second and third engines were of similar size. That\r\nerected at Ansthorpe was 23 inches in diameter of cylinder, and it was\r\na long time before much larger engines were constructed. Smeaton and\r\nothers finally made them as large as 6 feet in diameter.\r\n\r\nIn calculating the lifting-power of his engines, Newcomen's method was\r\n\"to square the diameter of the cylinder in inches, and, cutting off\r\nthe last figure, he called it 'long hundredweights;' then writing a\r\ncipher on the right hand, he called the number on that side 'odd\r\npounds;' this he reckoned tolerably exact at a mean, or rather when\r\nthe barometer was above 30 inches, and the air heavy.\" In allowing for\r\nfrictional and other losses, he deducted from one-fourth to one-third.\r\nDesaguliers found the rule quite exact. The usual mean pressure\r\nresisting the motion of the piston averaged, in the best engines,\r\nabout 8 pounds per square inch of its area. The speed of the piston\r\nwas from 150 to 175 feet per minute. The temperature of the hot-well\r\nwas from 145 deg. to 175 deg. Fahr.\r\n\r\nSmeaton made a number of test-trials of Newcomen engines to determine\r\ntheir \"duty\"--i. e., to ascertain the expenditure of fuel required to\r\nraise a definite quantity of water to a stated height. He found an\r\nengine 10 inches in diameter of cylinder, and of 3 feet stroke, could\r\ndo work equal to raising 2,919,017 pounds of water one foot high, with\r\na bushel of coals weighing 84 pounds.\r\n\r\nOne of Smeaton's larger engines, erected at Long Benton, was 52 inches\r\nin diameter of cylinder and of 7 feet stroke of piston, and made 12\r\nstrokes per minute. Its load was equal to 7-1/2 pounds per square inch\r\nof piston-area, and its effective capacity about 40 horse-power. Its\r\nduty was 9-1/2 millions of pounds raised one foot high per bushel of\r\ncoals. Its boiler evaporated 7.88 pounds of water per pound of fuel\r\nconsumed. It had 35 square feet of grate-surface and 142 square feet\r\nof heating-surface beneath the boilers, and 317 square feet in the\r\nflues--a total of 459 square feet. The moving parts of this engine\r\nweighed 8-1/2 tons.\r\n\r\nSmeaton erected one of these engines at the Chasewater mine, in\r\nCornwall, in 1775, which was of very considerable size. It was 6 feet\r\nin diameter of steam-cylinder, and had a maximum stroke of piston of\r\n9-1/2 feet. It usually worked 9 feet. The pumps were in three lifts of\r\nabout 100 feet each, and were 16-3/4 inches in diameter. Nine strokes\r\nwere made per minute. This engine replaced two others, of 64 and of 62\r\ninches diameter of cylinder respectively, and both of 6 feet stroke.\r\nOne engine at the lower lift supplied the second, which was set above\r\nit. The lower one had pumps 18-1/2 inches in diameter, and raised the\r\nwater 144 feet; the upper engine raised the water 156 feet, by pumps\r\n17-1/2 inches in diameter. The later engine replacing them exerted\r\n76-1/2 horse-power. There were three boilers, each 15 feet in\r\ndiameter, and having each 23 square feet of grate-surface. The chimney\r\nwas 22 feet high. The great beam, or \"lever,\" of this engine was built\r\nup of 20 beams of fir in two sets, placed side by side, and ten deep,\r\nstrongly bolted together. It was over 6 feet deep at the middle and 5\r\nfeet at the ends, and was 2 feet thick. The \"main centres,\" or\r\njournals, on which it vibrated were 8-1/2 inches in diameter and 8-1/2\r\ninches long. The cylinder weighed 6-1/2 tons, and was paid for at the\r\nrate of 28 shillings per hundredweight.\r\n\r\nBy the end of the eighteenth century, therefore, the engine of\r\nNewcomen, perfected by the ingenuity of Potter and of Beighton, and by\r\nthe systematic study and experimental research of Smeaton, had become\r\na well-established form of steam-engine, and its application to\r\nraising water had become general. The coal-mines of Coventry and of\r\nNewcastle had adopted this method of drainage; and the tin and the\r\ncopper mines of Cornwall had been deepened, using, for drainage,\r\nengines of the largest size.\r\n\r\nSome engines had been set up in and about London, the scene of\r\nWorcester's struggles and disappointments, where they were used to\r\nsupply water to large houses. Others were in use in other large cities\r\nof England, where water-works had been erected.\r\n\r\nSome engines had also been erected to drive mills indirectly by\r\nraising water to turn water-wheels. This is said by Farey to have been\r\nfirst practised in 1752, at a mill near Bristol, and became common\r\nduring the next quarter of a century. Many engines had been built in\r\nEngland and sent across the channel, to be applied to the drainage of\r\nmines on the Continent. Belidor[32] stated that the manufacture of\r\nthese \"fire-engines\" was exclusively confined to England; and this\r\nremained true many years after his time. When used for the drainage of\r\nmines, the engine usually worked the ordinary lift or bucket pump;\r\nwhen employed for water-supply to cities, the force or plunger pump\r\nwas often employed, the engine being placed below the level of the\r\nreservoir. Dr. Rees states that this engine was in common use among\r\nthe collieries of England as early as 1725.\r\n\r\n  [32] \"Architecture Hydraulique,\" 1734.\r\n\r\nThe Edmonstone colliery was licensed, in 1725, to erect an engine, not\r\nto exceed 28 inches diameter of cylinder and 9 feet stroke of piston,\r\npaying a royalty of L80 per annum for eight years. This engine was\r\nbuilt in Scotland, by workmen sent from England, and cost about\r\nL1,200. Its \"great cost\" is attributed to an extensive use of brass.\r\nThe workmen were paid their expenses and 15_s._ per week as wages. The\r\nbuilders were John and Abraham Potter, of Durham. An engine built in\r\n1775, having a steam-cylinder 48 inches in diameter and of 7 feet\r\nstroke, cost about L2,000.\r\n\r\nSmeaton found 57 engines at work near Newcastle in 1767, ranging in\r\nsize from 28 to 75 inches in diameter of cylinder, and of,\r\ncollectively, about 1,200 horse-power. Fifteen of these engines gave\r\nan average of 98 square inches of piston to the horse-power, and the\r\naverage duty was 5,590,000 pounds raised 1 foot high by 1 bushel (84\r\npounds) of coal. The highest duty noted was 7.44 millions; the lowest\r\nwas 3.22 millions. The most efficient engine had a steam-cylinder 42\r\ninches in diameter; the load was equivalent to 9-1/4 pounds per square\r\ninch of piston-area, and the horse-power developed was calculated to\r\nbe 16.7.\r\n\r\nPrice, writing in 1778, says, in the Appendix to his \"Mineralogia\r\nCornubiensis:\" \"Mr. Newcomen's invention of the fire-engine enabled us\r\nto sink our mines to twice the depth we could formerly do by any other\r\nmachinery. Since this invention was completed, most other attempts at\r\nits improvement have been very unsuccessful; but the vast consumption\r\nof fuel in these engines is an immense drawback on the profit of our\r\nmines, for every fire-engine of magnitude consumes L3,000 worth of\r\ncoals per annum. This heavy tax amounts almost to a prohibition.\"\r\n\r\nSmeaton was given the description, in 1773, of a _stone_ boiler, which\r\nwas used with one of these engines at a copper mine at Camborne, in\r\nCornwall. It contained three copper flues 22 inches in diameter. The\r\ngases were passed through these flues successively, finally passing\r\noff to the chimney. This boiler was cemented with hydraulic mortar. It\r\nwas 20 feet long, 9 feet wide, and 8-1/2 feet deep. It was heated by\r\nthe waste heat from the roasting-furnaces. This was one of the\r\nearliest flue-boilers ever made.\r\n\r\nIn 1780, Smeaton had a list of 18 large engines working in Cornwall.\r\nThe larger number of them were built by Jonathan Hornblower and John\r\nNancarron. At this time, the largest and best-known pumping-engine for\r\nwater-works was at York Buildings, in Villiers Street, Strand, London.\r\nIt had been in operation since 1752, and was erected beside one of\r\nSavery's engines, built in 1710. It had a steam-cylinder 45 inches in\r\ndiameter, and a stroke of piston of 8 feet, making 7-1/2 strokes per\r\nminute, and developing 35-1/2 horse-power. Its boiler was dome-shaped,\r\nof copper, and contained a large central fire-box and a spiral flue\r\nleading outward to the chimney. Another somewhat larger machine was\r\nbuilt and placed beside this engine, some time previous to 1775. Its\r\ncylinder was 49 inches in diameter, and its stroke 9 feet. It raised\r\nwater 102 feet. This engine was altered and improved by Smeaton in\r\n1777, and continued in use until 1813.\r\n\r\nSmeaton, as early as 1765, designed a _portable_ engine,[33] in which\r\nhe supported the machinery on a wooden frame mounted on short legs and\r\nstrongly put together, so that the whole machine could be transported\r\nand set at work wherever convenient.\r\n\r\n  [33] Smeaton's \"Reports,\" vol. i., p. 223.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 23.--Smeaton's Portable-Engine Boiler, 1765.]\r\n\r\nIn place of the beam, a large pulley was used, over which a chain was\r\ncarried, connecting the piston with the pump-rod, and the motion was\r\nsimilar to that given by the discarded beam. The wheel was supported\r\non A-frames, resembling somewhat the \"gallows-frames\" still used with\r\nthe beam-engines of American river-boats. The sills carrying the two\r\nA's supported the cylinder. The injection-cistern was supported above\r\nthe great pulley-wheel. The valve-gearing and the injection-pump were\r\nworked by a smaller wheel, mounted on the same axis with the larger\r\none. The boiler was placed apart from the engine, with which it was\r\nconnected by a steam-pipe, in which was placed the \"regulator,\" or\r\nthrottle-valve. The boiler (Fig. 23) \"was shaped like a large\r\ntea-kettle,\" and contained a fire-box, _B_, or internal furnace, of\r\nwhich the sides were made of cast-iron. The fire-door, _C_, was placed\r\non one side and opposite the flue, _D_, through which the products of\r\ncombustion were led to the chimney, _E_; a short, large pipe, _F_,\r\nleading downward from the furnace to the outside of the boiler, was\r\nthe ash-pit. The shell of the boiler, _A_, was made of iron plate\r\none-quarter of an inch thick. The steam-cylinder of the engine was 18\r\ninches in diameter, the stroke of piston 6 feet, the great wheel 6-1/2\r\nfeet in diameter, and the A-frames 9 feet high. The boiler was made 6\r\nfeet, the furnace 34 inches, and the grate 18 inches in diameter. The\r\npiston was intended to make 10 strokes per minute, and the engine to\r\ndevelop 4-1/8 horse-power.\r\n\r\nIn 1773, Smeaton prepared plans for a pumping-engine to be set up at\r\nCronstadt, the port of St. Petersburg, to empty the great dry dock\r\nconstructed by Peter the Great and Catherine, his successor. This\r\ngreat dock was begun in 1719. It was large enough to dock ten of the\r\nships of that time, and had previously been imperfectly drained by two\r\ngreat windmills 100 feet high. So imperfectly did they do their work,\r\nthat a _year_ was required to empty the dock, and it could therefore\r\nonly be used once in each summer. The engine was built at the Carron\r\nIron Works, in England. It had a cylinder 66 inches in diameter, and a\r\nstroke of piston of 8-1/2 feet. The lift varied from 33 feet when the\r\ndock was full to 53 feet when it was cleared of water. The load on the\r\nengine averaged about 8-1/3 pounds per square inch of piston-area.\r\nThere were three boilers, each 10 feet in diameter, and 16 feet 4\r\ninches high to the apex of its hemispherical dome. They contained\r\ninternal fire-boxes with grates of 20 feet area, and were surrounded\r\nby flues helically traversing the masonry setting. The engine was\r\nstarted in 1777, and worked very successfully.\r\n\r\nThe lowlands of Holland were, before the time of Smeaton, drained by\r\nmeans of windmills. The uncertainty and inefficiency of this method\r\nprecluded its application to anything like the extent to which\r\nsteam-power has since been utilized. In 1440, there were 150 inland\r\nlakes, or \"_meers_,\" in that country, of which nearly 100, having an\r\nextent of over 200,000 acres, have since been drained. The \"Haarlemmer\r\nMeer\" alone covers nearly 50,000 acres, and forms the basin of a\r\ndrainage-area of between 200,000 and 300,000 acres, receiving a\r\nrainfall of 54,000,000 tons, which must be raised 16 feet in\r\ndischarging it. The beds of these lakes are from 10 to 20 feet lower\r\nthan the water-level in the adjacent canals. In 1840, 12,000 windmills\r\nwere still employed in this work. In the following year, William II.,\r\nat the suggestion of a commission, decreed that only steam-engines\r\nshould be employed to do this immense work. Up to this time the\r\naverage consumption of fuel for the pumping-engines in use is said to\r\nhave been 20 pounds per hour per horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe first engine used was erected in 1777 and 1778, on the Newcomen\r\nplan, to assist the 34 windmills employed to drain a lake near\r\nRotterdam. This lake covered 7,000 acres, and its bed was 12 feet\r\nbelow the surface of the river Meuse, which passes it, and empties\r\ninto the sea in the immediate neighborhood. The iron parts of the\r\nengine were built in England, and the machine was put together in\r\nHolland. The steam-cylinder was 52 inches in diameter, and the stroke\r\nof piston 9 feet. The boiler was 18 feet in diameter, and contained a\r\ndouble flue. The main beam was 27 feet long. The pumps were 6 in\r\nnumber, 3 cylindrical and 3 having a square cross-section; 3 were of 6\r\nfeet and 3 of 2-1/2 feet stroke. Two pumps only were worked at\r\nhigh-tide, and the others were added one at a time, as the tide fell,\r\nuntil, at low-tide, all 6 were at work.\r\n\r\nThe size of this engine, and the magnitude of its work, seem\r\ninsignificant when compared with the machinery installed 60 years\r\nlater to drain the Haarlemmer Meer, and with the work done by the\r\nlast. These engines are 12 feet in diameter of cylinder and 10 feet\r\nstroke of piston, and work--they are 3 in number--the one 11 pumps of\r\n63 inches diameter and 10 feet stroke, the others 8 pumps of 73 inches\r\ndiameter and of the same length of stroke. The modern engines do a\r\n\"duty\" of 75,000,000 to 87,000,000 with 94 pounds of coal, consuming\r\n2-1/4 pounds of coal per hour and per horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe first steam-engine applied to working the blowing-machinery of a\r\nblast-furnace was erected at the Carron Iron-Works, in Scotland, near\r\nFalkirk, in 1765, and proved very unsatisfactory. Smeaton\r\nsubsequently, in 1769 or 1770, introduced better machinery into these\r\nworks and improved the old engine, and this use of the steam-engine\r\nsoon became usual. This engine did its work indirectly, furnishing\r\nwater, by pumping, to drive the water-wheels which worked the\r\nblowing-cylinders. Its steam-cylinder was 6 feet in diameter, and the\r\npump-cylinder 52 inches. The stroke was 9 feet.\r\n\r\nA direct-acting engine, used as a blowing-engine, was not constructed\r\nuntil about 1784, at which time a single-acting blowing-cylinder, or\r\nair-pump, was placed at the \"out-board\" end of the beam, where the\r\npump-rod had been attached. The piston of the air-cylinder was loaded\r\nwith the weights needed to force it down, expelling the air, and the\r\nengine did its work in raising the loaded piston, the air-cylinder\r\nfilling as the piston rose. A large \"accumulator\" was used to equalize\r\nthe pressure of the expelled air. This consisted of another\r\nair-cylinder, having a loaded piston which was left free to rise and\r\nfall. At each expulsion of air by the blowing-engine this cylinder was\r\nfilled, the loaded piston rising to the top. While the piston of the\r\nformer was returning, and the air-cylinder was taking in its charge of\r\nair, the accumulator would gradually discharge the stored air, the\r\npiston slowly falling under its load. This piston was called the\r\n\"floating piston,\" or \"fly-piston,\" and its action was, in effect,\r\nprecisely that of the upper portion of the common blacksmith's\r\nbellows.\r\n\r\nDr. Robison, the author of \"Mechanical Philosophy,\" one of the very\r\nfew works even now existing deserving such a title, describes one of\r\nthese engines[34] as working in Scotland in 1790. It had a\r\nsteam-cylinder 40 or 44 inches in diameter, a blowing-cylinder 60\r\ninches in diameter, and the stroke of piston was 6 feet. The\r\nair-pressure was 2.77 pounds per square inch as a maximum in the\r\nblowing-cylinder; and the floating piston in the regulating-cylinder\r\nwas loaded with 2.63 pounds per square inch. Making 15 or 18 strokes\r\nper minute, this engine delivered about 1,600 cubic feet of air, or\r\n120-1/2 pounds in weight, per minute, and developed 20 horse-power.\r\n\r\n  [34] \"Encyclopaedia Britannica,\" 1st edition.\r\n\r\nAt about the same date a change was made in the blowing-cylinder. The\r\nair entered at the bottom, as before, but was forced out at the top,\r\nthe piston being fitted with valves, as in the common lifting-pump,\r\nand the engine thus being arranged to do the work of expulsion during\r\nthe down-stroke of the steam-piston.\r\n\r\nFour years later, the regulating-cylinder, or accumulator, was given\r\nup, and the now familiar \"water-regulator\" was substituted for it.\r\nThis consists of a tank, usually of sheet-iron, set open-end downward\r\nin a large vessel containing water. The lower edge of the inner tank\r\nis supported on piers a few inches above the bottom of the large one.\r\nThe pipe carrying air from the blowing-engine passes above this\r\nwater-regulator, and a branch-pipe is led down into the inner tank. As\r\nthe air-pressure varies, the level of the water within the inverted\r\ntank changes, rising as pressure falls at the slowing of the motion of\r\nthe piston, and falling as the pressure rises again while the piston\r\nis moving with an accelerated velocity. The regulator, thus receiving\r\nsurplus air to be delivered when needed, greatly assists in regulating\r\nthe pressure. The larger the regulator, the more perfectly uniform the\r\npressure. The water-level outside the inner tank is usually five or\r\nsix feet higher than within it. This apparatus was found much more\r\nsatisfactory than the previously-used regulator, and, with its\r\nintroduction, the establishment of the steam-engine as a\r\nblowing-engine for iron-works and at blast-furnaces may be considered\r\nas having been fully established.\r\n\r\nThus, by the end of the third quarter of the eighteenth century, the\r\nsteam-engine had become generally introduced, and had been applied to\r\nnearly all of the purposes for which a single-acting engine could be\r\nused. The path which had been opened by Worcester had been fairly laid\r\nout by Savery and his contemporaries, and the builders of the Newcomen\r\nengine, with such improvements as they had been able to effect, had\r\nfollowed it as far as they were able. The real and practical\r\nintroduction of the steam-engine is as fairly attributable to Smeaton\r\nas to any one of the inventors whose names are more generally known in\r\nconnection with it. As a mechanic, he was unrivaled; as an engineer,\r\nhe was head and shoulders above any constructor of his time engaged in\r\ngeneral practice. There were very few important public works built in\r\nGreat Britain at that time in relation to which he was not consulted;\r\nand he was often visited by foreign engineers, who desired his advice\r\nwith regard to works in progress on the Continent.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER III.\r\n\r\n_THE DEVELOPMENT OF THE MODERN STEAM-ENGINE.

There is\r\n  nothing in the future more sure than the great triumphs which that\r\n  epoch is to achieve. It has already advanced to some glorious\r\n  conquests.

Of the personal history of the\r\nearlier inventors and improvers of the steam-engine, very little is\r\nascertained; but that of Watt has become well known.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Watt.]\r\n\r\nJAMES WATT was of an humble lineage, and was born at Greenock, then a\r\nlittle Scotch fishing village, but now a considerable and a busy town,\r\nwhich annually launches upon the waters of the Clyde a fleet of\r\nsteamships whose engines are probably, in the aggregate, far more\r\npowerful than were all the engines in the world at the date of Watt's\r\nbirth, January 19, 1736. His grandfather, Thomas Watt, of\r\nCrawfordsdyke, near Greenock, was a well-known mathematician about the\r\nyear 1700, and was for many years a schoolmaster at that place. His\r\nfather was a prominent citizen of Greenock, and was at various times\r\nchief magistrate and treasurer of the town. James Watt was a bright\r\nboy, but exceedingly delicate in health, and quite unable to attend\r\nschool regularly, or to apply himself closely to either study or play.\r\nHis early education was given by his parents, who were respectable and\r\nintelligent people, and the tools borrowed from his father's\r\ncarpenter-bench served at once to amuse him and to give him a\r\ndexterity and familiarity with their use that must undoubtedly have\r\nbeen of inestimable value to him in after-life.\r\n\r\nM. Arago, the eminent French philosopher, who wrote one of the\r\nearliest and most interesting biographies of Watt, relates anecdotes\r\nof him which, if correct, illustrate well his thoughtfulness and his\r\nintelligence, as well as the mechanical bent of the boy's mind. He is\r\nsaid, at the age of six years, to have occupied himself during leisure\r\nhours with the solution of geometrical problems; and Arago discovers,\r\nin a story in which he is described as experimenting with the\r\ntea-kettle,[35] his earliest investigations of the nature and\r\nproperties of steam.\r\n\r\n  [35] The same story is told of Savery and of Worcester.\r\n\r\nWhen finally sent to the village school, his ill health prevented his\r\nmaking rapid progress; and it was only when thirteen or fourteen years\r\nof age that he began to show that he was capable of taking the lead in\r\nhis class, and to exhibit his ability in the study, particularly, of\r\nmathematics. His spare time was principally spent in sketching with\r\nhis pencil, in carving, and in working at the bench, both in wood and\r\nmetal. He made many ingenious pieces of mechanism, and some beautiful\r\nmodels. His favorite work seemed to be the repairing of nautical\r\ninstruments. Among other pieces of apparatus made by the boy was a\r\nvery fine barrel-organ. In boyhood, as in after-life, he was a\r\ndiligent reader, and seemed to find something to interest him in every\r\nbook that came into his hands.\r\n\r\nAt the age of eighteen, Watt was sent to Glasgow, there to\r\nreside with his mother's relatives, and to learn the trade of a\r\nmathematical-instrument maker. The mechanic with whom he was placed\r\nwas soon found too indolent, or was otherwise incapable of giving\r\nmuch aid in the project, and Dr. Dick, of the University of Glasgow,\r\nwith whom Watt became acquainted, advised him to go to London.\r\nAccordingly, he set out in June, 1755, for the metropolis, where, on\r\nhis arrival, he arranged with Mr. John Morgan, in Cornhill, to work a\r\nyear at his chosen business, receiving as compensation 20 guineas. At\r\nthe end of the year he was compelled, by serious ill-health, to return\r\nhome.\r\n\r\nHaving become restored to health, he went again to Glasgow in 1756,\r\nwith the intention of pursuing his calling there. But, not being the\r\nson of a burgess, and not having served his apprenticeship in the\r\ntown, he was forbidden by the guilds, or trades-unions, to open a shop\r\nin Glasgow. Dr. Dick came to his aid, and employed him to repair some\r\napparatus which had been bequeathed to the college. He was finally\r\nallowed the use of three rooms in the University building, its\r\nauthorities not being under the municipal rule. He remained here until\r\n1760, when, the trades no longer objecting, he took a shop in the\r\ncity; and in 1761 moved again, into a shop on the north side of the\r\nTrongate, where he earned a scanty living without molestation, and\r\nstill kept up his connection with the college. He did some work as a\r\ncivil engineer in the neighborhood of Glasgow, but soon gave up all\r\nother employment, and devoted himself entirely to mechanics.\r\n\r\nHe spent much of his leisure time--of which he had, at first, more\r\nthan was desirable--in making philosophical experiments and in the\r\nmanufacture of musical instruments, in making himself familiar with\r\nthe sciences, and in devising improvements in the construction of\r\norgans. In order to pursue his researches more satisfactorily, he\r\nstudied German and Italian, and read Smith's \"Harmonics,\" that he\r\nmight become familiar with the principles of construction of musical\r\ninstruments. His reading was still very desultory; but the\r\nintroduction of the Newcomen engine in the neighborhood of Glasgow,\r\nand the presence of a model in the college collections, which was\r\nplaced in his hands, in 1763, for repair, led him to study the history\r\nof the steam-engine, and to conduct for himself an experimental\r\nresearch into the properties of steam, with a set of improvised\r\napparatus.\r\n\r\nDr. Robison, then a student of the University, who found Watt's shop a\r\npleasant place in which to spend his leisure, and whose tastes\r\naffiliated so strongly with those of Watt that they became friends\r\nimmediately upon making acquaintance, called the attention of the\r\ninstrument-maker to the steam-engine as early as 1759, and suggested\r\nthat it might be applied to the propulsion of carriages. Watt was at\r\nonce interested, and went to work on a little model, having tin\r\nsteam-cylinders and pistons connected to the driving-wheels by an\r\nintermediate system of gearing. The scheme was afterwards given up,\r\nand was not revived by Watt for a quarter of a century.\r\n\r\nWatt studied chemistry, and was assisted by the advice and instruction\r\nof Dr. Black, who was then making the researches which resulted in the\r\ndiscovery of \"latent heat.\" His proposal to repair the model Newcomen\r\nengine in the college collections led to his study of Desaguliers's\r\ntreatise, and of the works of Switzer and others. He thus learned what\r\nhad been done by Savery and by Newcomen, and by those who had improved\r\nthe engine of the latter.\r\n\r\nIn his own experiments he used, at first, apothecaries' phials and\r\nhollow canes for steam reservoirs and pipes, and later a Papin's\r\ndigester and a common syringe. The latter combination made a\r\nnon-condensing engine, in which he used steam at a pressure of 15\r\npounds per square inch. The valve was worked by hand, and Watt saw\r\nthat an automatic valve-gear only was needed to make a working\r\nmachine. This experiment, however, led to no practical result. He\r\nfinally took hold of the Newcomen model, which had been obtained from\r\nLondon, where it had been sent for repairs, and, putting it in good\r\nworking order, commenced experiments with that.\r\n\r\nThe Newcomen model, as it happened, had a boiler which, although made\r\nto a scale from engines in actual use, was quite incapable of\r\nfurnishing steam enough to work the engine. It was about nine inches\r\nin diameter; the steam-cylinder was two inches in diameter, and of six\r\ninches stroke of piston, arranged as in Fig. 24, which is a picture of\r\nthe model as it now appears. It is retained among the most\r\ncarefully-preserved treasures of the University of Glasgow.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 24.--The Newcomen Model.]\r\n\r\nWatt made a new boiler for the experimental investigation on which he\r\nwas about to enter, and arranged it in such a manner that he could\r\nmeasure the quantity of water evaporated and of steam used at every\r\nstroke of the engine.\r\n\r\nHe soon discovered that it required but a very small quantity of steam\r\nto heat a very large quantity of water, and immediately attempted to\r\ndetermine with precision the relative weights of steam and water in\r\nthe steam-cylinder when condensation took place at the down-stroke of\r\nthe engine, and thus independently proved the existence of that\r\n\"latent heat,\" the discovery of which constitutes, also, one of the\r\ngreatest of Dr. Black's claims to distinction. Watt at once went to\r\nDr. Black and related the remarkable fact which he had thus detected,\r\nand was, in turn, taught by Black the character of the phenomenon as\r\nit had been explained to his classes by the latter some little time\r\npreviously. Watt found that, at the boiling-point, his steam,\r\ncondensing, was capable of heating six times its weight of water such\r\nas was used for producing condensation.\r\n\r\nPerceiving that steam, weight for weight even, was a vastly greater\r\nabsorbent and reservoir of heat than water, Watt saw plainly the\r\nimportance of taking greater care to economize it than had previously\r\nbeen customary. He first attempted to economize in the boiler, and\r\nmade boilers with wooden \"shells,\" in order to prevent losses by\r\nconduction and radiation, and used a larger number of flues to secure\r\nmore complete absorption of the heat from the furnace-gases. He also\r\ncovered his steam-pipes with non-conducting materials, and took every\r\nprecaution that his ingenuity could devise to secure complete\r\nutilization of the heat of combustion. He soon found, however, that he\r\nwas not working at the most important point, and that the great source\r\nof loss was to be found in defects which he noted in the action of the\r\nsteam in the cylinder. He soon concluded that the sources of loss of\r\nheat in the Newcomen engine--which would be greatly exaggerated in a\r\nsmall model--were:\r\n\r\nFirst, the dissipation of heat by the cylinder itself, which was of\r\nbrass, and was both a good conductor and a good radiator.\r\n\r\nSecondly, the loss of heat consequent upon the necessity of cooling\r\ndown the cylinder at every stroke, in producing the vacuum.\r\n\r\nThirdly, the loss of power due to the pressure of vapor beneath the\r\npiston, which was a consequence of the imperfect method of\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\nHe first made a cylinder of non-conducting material--wood soaked in\r\noil and then baked--and obtained a decided advantage in economy of\r\nsteam. He then conducted a series of very accurate experiments upon\r\nthe temperature and pressure of steam at such points on the scale as\r\nhe could readily reach, and, constructing a curve with his results,\r\nthe abscesses representing temperatures and the pressures being\r\nrepresented by the ordinates, he ran the curve backward until he had\r\nobtained closely-approximate measures of temperatures less than 212 deg.,\r\nand pressures less than atmospheric. He thus found that, with the\r\namount of injection-water used in the Newcomen engine, bringing the\r\ntemperature of the interior, as he found, down to from 140 deg. to 175 deg.\r\nFahr., a very considerable back-pressure would be met with.\r\n\r\nContinuing his examination still further, he measured the amount of\r\nsteam used at each stroke, and, comparing it with the quantity that\r\nwould just fill the cylinder, he found that at least _three-fourths\r\nwas wasted_. The quantity of cold water necessary to produce the\r\ncondensation of a given weight of steam was next determined; and he\r\nfound that one pound of steam contained enough heat to raise about six\r\npounds of cold water, as used for condensation, from the temperature\r\nof 52 deg. to the boiling-point; and, going still further, he found that\r\nhe was compelled to use, at each stroke of the Newcomen engine, _four\r\ntimes as much injection-water as should suffice to condense a cylinder\r\nfull of steam_. This confirmed his previous conclusion that\r\nthree-fourths of the heat supplied to the engine was wasted.\r\n\r\nWatt had now, therefore, determined by his own researches, as he\r\nhimself enumerates them,[36] the following facts:\r\n\r\n  [36] Robison's \"Mechanical Philosophy,\" edited by Brewster.\r\n\r\n\"1. The capacities for heat of iron, copper, and of some sorts of\r\nwood, as compared with water.\r\n\r\n\"2. The bulk of steam compared with that of water.\r\n\r\n\"3. The quantity of water evaporated in a certain boiler by a pound of\r\ncoal.\r\n\r\n\"4. The elasticities of steam at various temperatures greater than\r\nthat of boiling water, and an approximation to the law which it\r\nfollows at other temperatures.\r\n\r\n\"5. How much water in the form of steam was required every stroke by a\r\nsmall Newcomen engine, with a wooden cylinder 6 inches in diameter and\r\n12 inches stroke.\r\n\r\n\"6. The quantity of cold water required in every stroke to condense\r\nthe steam in that cylinder, so as to give it a working-power of about\r\n7 pounds on the square inch.\"\r\n\r\nAfter these well-devised and truly scientific investigations, Watt was\r\nenabled to enter upon his work of improving the steam-engine with an\r\nintelligent understanding of its existing defects, and with a\r\nknowledge of their cause. Watt soon saw that, in order to reduce the\r\nlosses in the working of the steam in the steam-cylinder, it would be\r\nnecessary to find some means, as he said, to keep the cylinder \"always\r\nas hot as the steam that entered it,\" notwithstanding the great\r\nfluctuations of temperature and pressure of the steam during the up\r\nand the down strokes. He has told us how, finally, the happy thought\r\noccurred to him which relieved him of all difficulty, and led to the\r\nseries of modifications which at last gave to the world the modern\r\ntype of steam-engine.\r\n\r\nHe says:[37] \"I had gone to take a walk on a fine Sabbath afternoon. I\r\nhad entered the Green by the gate at the foot of Charlotte street, and\r\nhad passed the old washing-house. I was thinking upon the engine at\r\nthe time, and had gone as far as the herd's house, when the idea came\r\ninto my mind that, as steam was an elastic body, it would rush into a\r\nvacuum, and, if a communication were made between the cylinder and an\r\nexhausted vessel, it would rush into it, and might be there condensed\r\nwithout cooling the cylinder. I then saw that I must get rid of the\r\ncondensed steam and injection-water if I used a jet, as in Newcomen's\r\nengine. Two ways of doing this occurred to me: First, the water might\r\nbe run off by a descending pipe, if an offlet could be got at the\r\ndepth of 35 or 36 feet, and any air might be extracted by a small\r\npump. The second was, to make the pump large enough to extract both\r\nwater and air.\" \"I had not walked farther than the Golf-house, when\r\nthe whole thing was arranged in my mind.\"\r\n\r\n  [37] \"Reminiscences of James Watt,\" Robert Hart; \"Transactions of\r\n  the Glasgow Archaeological Society,\" 1859.\r\n\r\nReferring to this invention, Watt said to Prof. Jardine:[38] \"When\r\nanalyzed, the invention would not appear so great as it seemed to be.\r\nIn the state in which I found the steam-engine, it was no great effort\r\nof mind to observe that the quantity of fuel necessary to make it work\r\nwould forever prevent its extensive utility. The next step in my\r\nprogress was equally easy--to inquire what was the cause of the great\r\nconsumption of fuel. This, too, was readily suggested, viz., the waste\r\nof fuel which was necessary to bring the whole cylinder, piston, and\r\nadjacent parts from the coldness of water to the heat of steam, no\r\nfewer than from 15 to 20 times in a minute.\" It was by pursuing this\r\ntrain of thought that he was led to devise the separate condenser.\r\n\r\n  [38] \"Lives of Boulton and Watt,\" Smiles.\r\n\r\nOn Monday morning Watt proceeded to make an experimental test of his\r\nnew invention, using for his steam-cylinder and piston a large brass\r\nsurgeon's-syringe, 1-3/4-inch diameter and 10 inches long. At each end\r\nwas a pipe leading steam from the boiler, and fitted with a cock to\r\nact as a steam-valve. A pipe led also from the top of the cylinder to\r\nthe condenser, the syringe being inverted and the piston-rod hanging\r\ndownward for convenience. The condenser was made of two pipes of thin\r\ntin plate, 10 or 12 inches long, and about one-sixth of an inch in\r\ndiameter, standing vertically, and having a connection at the top\r\nwith a horizontal pipe of larger size, and fitted with a\r\n\"snifting-valve.\" Another vertical pipe, about an inch in diameter,\r\nwas connected to the condenser, and was fitted with a piston, with a\r\nview to using it as an \"air-pump.\" The whole was set in a cistern of\r\ncold water. The piston-rod of the little steam-cylinder was drilled\r\nfrom end to end to permit the water to be removed from the cylinder.\r\nThis little model (Fig. 25) worked very satisfactorily, and the\r\nperfection of the vacuum was such that the machine lifted a weight of\r\n18 pounds hung upon the piston-rod, as in the sketch. A larger model\r\nwas immediately afterward constructed, and the result of its test\r\nconfirmed fully the anticipations which had been awakened by the first\r\nexperiment.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 25.--Watt's Experiment.]\r\n\r\nHaving taken this first step and made such a radical improvement, the\r\nsuccess of this invention was no sooner determined than others\r\nfollowed in rapid succession, as consequences of the exigencies\r\narising from the first change in the old Newcomen engine. But in the\r\nworking out of the forms and proportions of the details of the new\r\nengine, even Watt's powerful mind, stored as it was with\r\nhappily-combined scientific and practical information, was occupied\r\nfor years. In attaching the separate condenser, he first attempted\r\nsurface-condensation; but this not succeeding well, he substituted the\r\njet. Some provision became at once necessary for preventing the\r\nfilling of the condenser with water.\r\n\r\nWatt at first intended adopting the expedient which had worked\r\nsatisfactorily with the less effective condensation of Newcomen's\r\nengine--i. e., leading a pipe from the condenser to a depth greater\r\nthan the height of a column of water which could be counterbalanced by\r\nthe pressure of the atmosphere; but he subsequently employed the\r\nair-pump, which relieves the condenser not only of the water, but of\r\nthe air which also usually collects in considerable volume in the\r\ncondenser, and vitiates the vacuum. He next substituted oil and tallow\r\nfor water in the lubrication of the piston and keeping it steam-tight,\r\nin order to avoid the cooling of the cylinder incident to the use of\r\nthe latter. Another cause of refrigeration of the cylinder, and\r\nconsequent waste of power in its operation, was seen to be the\r\nentrance of the atmosphere, which followed the piston down the\r\ncylinder at each stroke, cooling its interior by its contact. This the\r\ninventor concluded to prevent by covering the top of the cylinder,\r\nallowing the piston-rod to play through a \"stuffing-box\"--which device\r\nhad long been known to mechanics.\r\n\r\nHe accordingly not only covered the top, but surrounded the whole\r\ncylinder with an external casing, or \"steam-jacket,\" and allowed the\r\nsteam from the boiler to pass around the steam-cylinder and to press\r\nupon the upper surface of the piston, where its pressure was variable\r\nat pleasure, and therefore more manageable than that of the\r\natmosphere. It also, besides keeping the cylinder hot, could do\r\ncomparatively little harm should it leak by the piston, as it could be\r\ncondensed, and thus readily disposed of.\r\n\r\nWhen he had concluded to build the larger experimental engine, Watt\r\ndetermined to give his whole time and attention to the work, and hired\r\na room in an old deserted pottery near the Broomielaw. Here he worked\r\nwith a mechanic--John Gardiner, whom he had taken into his\r\nemploy--uninterruptedly for many weeks. Meantime, through his friend\r\nDr. Black, probably, he had made the acquaintance of Dr. Roebuck, a\r\nwealthy physician, who had, with other Scotch capitalists, just\r\nfounded the celebrated Carron Iron-Works, and had opened a\r\ncorrespondence with him, in which he kept that gentleman informed of\r\nthe progress of his work on the new engine.\r\n\r\nThis engine had a steam-cylinder, Watt tells us, of \"five or six\"\r\ninches diameter, and of two feet stroke. It was of copper,\r\nsmooth-hammered, but not bored out, and \"not very true.\" This was\r\nencased in another cylinder of wood. In August, 1765, he tried the\r\nsmall engine, and wrote Dr. Roebuck that he had had \"good success,\"\r\nalthough the machine was very imperfect. \"On turning the\r\nexhausting-cock, the piston, when not loaded, ascended as quick as the\r\nblow of a hammer, and as quick when loaded with 18 pounds (being 7\r\npounds on the inch) as it would have done if it had had an injection\r\nas usual.\" He then tells his correspondent that he was about to make\r\nthe larger model. In October, 1765, he finished the latter. The\r\nengine, when ready for trial, was still very imperfect. It\r\nnevertheless did good work for so rude a machine.\r\n\r\nWatt was now reduced to poverty, and, after borrowing considerable\r\nsums from friends, he was finally compelled to give up his scheme for\r\nthe time, and to seek employment in order to provide for his family.\r\nDuring an interval of about two years he supported himself by\r\nsurveying, and by the work of exploring coal-fields in the\r\nneighborhood of Glasgow for the magistrates of the city. He did not,\r\nhowever, entirely give up his invention.\r\n\r\nIn 1767, Dr. Roebuck assumed Watt's liabilities to the amount of\r\nL1,000, and agreed to provide capital for the prosecution of his\r\nexperiments and to introduce his invention; and, on the other hand,\r\nWatt agreed to surrender to Dr. Roebuck two-thirds of the patent.\r\nAnother engine was next built, having a steam-cylinder seven or eight\r\ninches in diameter, which was finished in 1768. This worked\r\nsufficiently well to induce the partners to ask for a patent, and the\r\nspecifications and drawings were completed and presented in 1769.\r\n\r\nWatt also built and set up several Newcomen engines, partly, perhaps,\r\nto make himself thus thoroughly familiar with the practical details of\r\nengine-building. Meantime, also, he prepared the plans for, and\r\nfinally had built, a moderately large engine of his own new type. Its\r\nsteam-cylinder was 18 inches in diameter, and the stroke of piston was\r\n5 feet. This engine was built at Kinneil, and was finished in\r\nSeptember, 1769. It was not all satisfactory in either its\r\nconstruction or its operation. The condenser was a surface-condenser\r\ncomposed of pipes somewhat like that used in his first little model,\r\nand did not prove to be satisfactorily tight. The steam-piston leaked\r\nseriously, and repeated trials only served to make more evident its\r\nimperfections. He was assisted in this time of need by both Dr. Black\r\nand Dr. Roebuck; but he felt strongly the risks which he ran of\r\ninvolving his friends in serious losses, and became very despondent.\r\nWriting to Dr. Black, he says: \"Of all things in life, there is\r\nnothing more foolish than inventing;\" and probably the majority of\r\ninventors have been led to the same opinion by their own experiences.\r\n\r\n\"Misfortunes never come singly;\" and Watt was borne down by the\r\ngreatest of all misfortunes--the loss of a faithful and affectionate\r\nwife--while still unable to see a successful issue of his schemes.\r\nOnly less disheartening than this was the loss of fortune of his\r\nsteadfast friend, Dr. Roebuck, and the consequent loss of his aid. It\r\nwas at about this time, in the year 1769, that negotiations were\r\ncommenced which resulted in the transfer of the capitalized interest\r\nin Watt's engine to the wealthy manufacturer whose name, coupled with\r\nthat of Watt, afterward became known throughout the civilized world,\r\nas the steam-engine in its new form was pushed into use by his energy\r\nand business tact.\r\n\r\nWatt met Mr. Boulton, who next became his partner, in 1768, on his\r\njourney to London to procure his patent, and the latter had then\r\nexamined Watt's designs, and, at once perceiving their value, proposed\r\nto purchase an interest. Watt was then unable to reply definitely to\r\nBoulton's proposition, pending his business arrangements with Dr.\r\nRoebuck; but, with Roebuck's consent, afterwards proposed that Boulton\r\nshould take a one-third interest with himself and partner, paying\r\nRoebuck therefor one-half of all expenses previously incurred, and\r\nwhatever he should choose to add to compensate \"for the risk he had\r\nrun.\" Subsequently, Dr. Roebuck proposed to transfer to Boulton and to\r\nDr. Small, who was desirous of taking interest with Boulton, one-half\r\nof his proprietorship in Watt's inventions, on receiving \"a sum not\r\nless than one thousand pounds,\" which should, after the experiments on\r\nthe engine were completed, be deemed \"just and reasonable.\" Twelve\r\nmonths were allowed for the adjustment of the account. This proposal\r\nwas accepted in November, 1769.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Matthew Boulton.]\r\n\r\nMATTHEW BOULTON, who now became a partner with James Watt, was the son\r\nof a Birmingham silver stamper and piecer, and succeeded to his\r\nfather's business, building up a great establishment, which, as well\r\nas its proprietor, was well known in Watt's time. Watt, writing to Dr.\r\nRoebuck before the final arrangement had been made, urged him to close\r\nwith Boulton for \"the following considerations:\r\n\r\n\"1st. From Mr. Boulton's own character as an ingenious, honest, and\r\nrich man. 2dly. From the difficulty and expense there would be of\r\nprocuring accurate and honest workmen and providing them with proper\r\nutensils, and getting a proper overseer or overseers. If, to avoid\r\nthis inconvenience, you were to contract for the work to be done by a\r\nmaster-workman, you must give up a great share of the profit. 3dly.\r\nThe success of the engine is far from being verified. If Mr. Boulton\r\ntakes his chance of success from the account I shall write Dr. Small,\r\nand pays you any adequate share of the money laid out, it lessens your\r\nrisk, and in a greater proportion than I think it will lessen your\r\nprofits. 4thly. The assistance of Mr. Boulton's and Dr. Small's\r\ningenuity (if the latter engage in it) in improving and perfecting the\r\nmachine may be very considerable, and may enable us to get the better\r\nof the difficulties that might otherwise damn it. Lastly, consider my\r\nuncertain health, my irresolute and inactive disposition, my inability\r\nto bargain and struggle for my own with mankind: all which disqualify\r\nme for any great undertaking. On our side, consider the first outlay\r\nand interest, the patent, the present engine, about L200 (though there\r\nwould not be much loss in making it into a common engine), two years\r\nof my time, and the expense of models.\"\r\n\r\nWatt's estimate of the value of Boulton's ingenuity and talent was\r\nwell-founded. Boulton had shown himself a good scholar, and had\r\nacquired considerable knowledge of the languages and of the sciences,\r\nparticularly of mathematics, after leaving the school from which he\r\ngraduated into the shop when still a boy. In the shop he soon\r\nintroduced a number of valuable improvements, and he was always on the\r\nlookout for improvements made by others, with a view to their\r\nintroduction in his business. He was a man of the modern style, and\r\nnever permitted competitors to excel him in any respect, without the\r\nstrongest efforts to retain his leading position. He always aimed to\r\nearn a reputation for good work, as well as to make money. His\r\nfather's workshop was at Birmingham; but Boulton, after a time, found\r\nthat his rapidly-increasing business would compel him to find room for\r\nthe erection of a more extensive establishment, and he secured land at\r\nSoho, two miles distant from Birmingham, and there erected his new\r\nmanufactory, about 1762.\r\n\r\nThe business was, at first, the manufacture of ornamental metal-ware,\r\nsuch as metal buttons, buckles, watch-chains, and light filigree and\r\ninlaid work. The manufacture of gold and silver plated-ware was soon\r\nadded, and this branch of business gradually developed into a very\r\nextensive manufacture of works of art. Boulton copied fine work\r\nwherever he could find it, and often borrowed vases, statuettes, and\r\nbronzes of all kinds from the nobility of England, and even from the\r\nqueen, from which to make copies. The manufacture of inexpensive\r\nclocks, such as are now well known throughout the world as an article\r\nof American trade, was begun by Boulton. He made some fine\r\nastronomical and valuable ornamental clocks, which were better\r\nappreciated on the Continent than in England. The business of the Soho\r\nmanufactory in a few years became so extensive, that its goods were\r\nknown to every civilized nation, and its growth, under the management\r\nof the enterprising, conscientious, and ingenious Boulton, more than\r\nkept pace with the accumulation of capital; and the proprietor found\r\nhimself, by his very prosperity, often driven to the most careful\r\nmanipulation of his assets, and to making free use of his credit.\r\n\r\nBoulton had a remarkable talent for making valuable acquaintances, and\r\nfor making the most of advantages accruing thereby. In 1758 he made\r\nthe acquaintance of Benjamin Franklin, who then visited Soho; and in\r\n1766 these distinguished men, who were then unaware of the existence\r\nof James Watt, were corresponding, and, in their letters, discussing\r\nthe applicability of steam-power to various useful purposes. Between\r\nthe two a new steam-engine was designed, and a model was constructed\r\nby Boulton, which was sent to Franklin and exhibited by him in London.\r\n\r\nDr. Darwin seems to have had something to do with this scheme, and the\r\nenthusiasm awakened by the promise of success given by this model may\r\nhave been the origin of the now celebrated prophetic rhymes so often\r\nquoted from the works of that eccentric physician and poet. Franklin\r\ncontributed, as his share in the plan, an idea of so arranging the\r\ngrate as to prevent the production of smoke. He says: \"All that is\r\nnecessary is to make the smoke of fresh coals pass descending through\r\nthose that are already ignited.\" His idea has been, by more recent\r\nschemers, repeatedly brought forward as new. Nothing resulted from\r\nthese experiments of Boulton, Franklin, and Darwin, and the plan of\r\nWatt soon superseded all less well-developed plans.\r\n\r\nIn 1767, Watt visited Soho and carefully inspected Boulton's\r\nestablishment. He was very favorably impressed by the admirable\r\narrangement of the workshops and the completeness of their outfit, as\r\nwell as by the perfection of the organization and administration of\r\nthe business. In the following year he again visited Soho, and this\r\ntime met Boulton, who had been absent at the previous visit. The two\r\ngreat mechanics were mutually gratified by the meeting, and each at\r\nonce acquired for the other the greatest respect and esteem. They\r\ndiscussed Watt's plans, and Boulton then definitely decided not to\r\ncontinue his own experiments, although he had actually commenced the\r\nconstruction of a pumping-engine. With Dr. Small, who was also at\r\nSoho, Watt discussed the possibility of applying his engine to the\r\npropulsion of carriages, and to other purposes. On his return home,\r\nWatt continued his desultory labors on his engines, as already\r\ndescribed; and the final completion of the arrangement with Boulton,\r\nwhich immediately followed the failure of Dr. Roebuck, took place some\r\ntime later.\r\n\r\nBefore Watt could leave Scotland to join his partner at Soho, it was\r\nnecessary that he should finish the work which he had in hand,\r\nincluding the surveys of the Caledonian canal, and other smaller\r\nworks, which he had had in progress some months. He reached Birmingham\r\nin the spring of 1774, and was at once domiciled at Soho, where he set\r\nat work upon the partly-made engines which had been sent from Scotland\r\nsome time previously. They had laid, unused and exposed to the\r\nweather, at Kinneil three years, and were not in as good order as\r\nmight have been desired. The _block-tin_ steam-cylinder was probably\r\nin good condition, but the iron parts were, as Watt said, \"perishing,\"\r\nwhile he had been engaged in his civil engineering work. At leisure\r\nmoments, during this period, Watt had not entirely neglected his plans\r\nfor the utilization of steam. He had given much thought, and had\r\nexpended some time, in experiments upon the plan of using it in a\r\nrotary or \"wheel\" engine. He did not succeed in contriving any plan\r\nwhich seemed to promise success.\r\n\r\nIt was in November, 1774, that Watt finally announced to his old\r\npartner, Dr. Roebuck, the successful trial of the Kinneil engine. He\r\ndid not write with the usual enthusiasm and extravagance of the\r\ninventor, for his frequent disappointments and prolonged suspense had\r\nvery thoroughly extinguished his vivacity. He simply wrote: \"The\r\nfire-engine I have invented is now going, and answers much better than\r\nany other that has yet been made; and I expect that the invention will\r\nbe very beneficial to me.\"\r\n\r\nThe change of the \"atmospheric engine\" of Newcomen into the modern\r\nsteam-engine was now completed in its essential details. The first\r\nengine which was erected at Kinneil, near Boroughstoness, had a\r\nsteam-cylinder 18 inches in diameter. It is seen in the accompanying\r\nsketch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 26.--Watt's Engine, 1774.]\r\n\r\nIn Fig. 26, the steam passes from the boiler through the pipe _d_ and\r\nthe valve _c_ to the cylinder-casing or steam-jacket, _Y Y_, and above\r\nthe piston, _b_, which it follows in its descent in the cylinder,\r\n_a_, the valve _f_ being at this time open, to allow the exhaust into\r\nthe condenser, _h_.\r\n\r\nThe piston now being at the lower end of the cylinder, and the\r\npump-rods at the opposite end of the beam, _y_, being thus raised and\r\nthe pumps filled with water, the valves _c_ and _f_ close, while _e_\r\nopens, allowing the steam which remains above the piston to flow\r\nbeneath it, until, the pressures becoming equal above and below, the\r\nweight of the pump-rods overbalancing that of the piston, the latter\r\nis rapidly drawn to the top of the cylinder, while the steam is\r\ndisplaced above, passing to the under-side of the piston.\r\n\r\nThe valve _e_ is next closed, and _c_ and _f_ are again opened; the\r\ndown-stroke is repeated. The water and air entering the condenser are\r\nremoved at each stroke by the air-pump, _i_, which communicates with\r\nthe condenser by the passage _s_. The pump _q_ supplies\r\ncondensing-water, and the pump _A_ takes away a part of the water of\r\ncondensation, which is thrown by the air-pump into the \"hot-well,\"\r\n_k_, and from it the feed-pump supplies the boiler. The valves are\r\nmoved by valve-gear very similar to Beighton's and Smeaton's, by the\r\npins, _m m_, in the \"plug-frame\" or \"tappet-rod,\" _n n_.\r\n\r\nThe engine is mounted upon a substantial foundation, _B B_. _F_ is an\r\nopening out of which, before starting the engine, the air is driven\r\nfrom the cylinder and condenser.\r\n\r\nThe inventions covered by the patent of 1769 were described as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n\"My method of lessening the consumption of steam, and consequently\r\nfuel, in fire-engines, consists in the following principles:\r\n\r\n\"1st. That the vessel in which the powers of steam are to be employed\r\nto work the engine--which is called 'the cylinder' in common\r\nfire-engines, and which I call 'the steam-vessel'--must, during the\r\nwhole time that the engine is at work, be kept as hot as the steam\r\nwhich enters it; first, by inclosing it in a case of wood, or any\r\nother materials that transmit heat slowly; secondly, by surrounding\r\nit with steam or other heated bodies; and thirdly, by suffering\r\nneither water nor other substances colder than the steam to enter or\r\ntouch it during that time.\r\n\r\n\"2dly. In engines that are to be worked, wholly or partially, by\r\ncondensation of steam, the steam is to be condensed in vessels\r\ndistinct from the steam-vessel or cylinder, though occasionally\r\ncommunicating with them. These vessels I call condensers; and while\r\nthe engines are working, these _condensers_ ought at least to be kept\r\nas cold as the air in the neighborhood of the engines, by application\r\nof water or other cold bodies.\r\n\r\n\"3dly. Whatever air or other elastic vapor is not condensed by the\r\ncold of the condenser, and may impede the working of the engine, is to\r\nbe drawn out of the steam-vessels or condensers by means of pumps,\r\nwrought by the engines themselves, or otherwise.\r\n\r\n\"4thly. I intend in many cases to employ the expansive force of steam\r\nto press on the pistons, or whatever may be used instead of them, in\r\nthe same manner as the pressure of the atmosphere is now employed in\r\ncommon fire-engines. In cases where cold water cannot be had in\r\nplenty, the engines may be wrought by this force of steam only, by\r\ndischarging the steam into the open air after it has done its office.\r\n\r\n\"5thly. Where motions round an axis are required, I make the\r\nsteam-vessels in form of hollow rings or circular channels, with\r\nproper inlets and outlets for the steam, mounted on horizontal axles\r\nlike the wheels of a water-mill. Within them are placed a number of\r\nvalves that suffer any body to go round the channel in one direction\r\nonly. In these steam-vessels are placed weights, so fitted to them as\r\nto fill up a part or portion of their channels, yet rendered capable\r\nof moving freely in them by the means hereinafter mentioned or\r\nspecified. When the steam is admitted in these engines between these\r\nweights and the valves, it acts equally on both, so as to raise the\r\nweight on one side of the wheel, and, by the reaction of the valves\r\nsuccessively, to give a circular motion to the wheel, the valves\r\nopening in the direction in which the weights are pressed, but not in\r\nthe contrary. As the vessel moves round, it is supplied with steam\r\nfrom the boiler, and that which has performed its office may either be\r\ndischarged by means of condensers, or into the open air.\r\n\r\n\"6thly. I intend in some cases to apply a degree of cold not capable\r\nof reducing the steam to water, but of contracting it considerably, so\r\nthat the engines shall be worked by the alternate expansion and\r\ncontraction of the steam.\r\n\r\n\"Lastly, instead of using water to render the piston or other parts of\r\nthe engine air or steam-tight, I employ oils, wax, resinous bodies,\r\nfat of animals, quicksilver, and other metals, in their fluid state.\"\r\n\r\nIn the construction and erection of his engines, Watt still had great\r\ndifficulty in finding skillful workmen to make the parts with\r\naccuracy, to fit them with care, and to erect them properly when once\r\nfinished. And the fact that both Newcomen and Watt met with such\r\nserious trouble, indicates that, even had the engine been designed\r\nearlier, it is quite unlikely that the world would have seen the\r\nsteam-engine a success until this time, when mechanics were just\r\nacquiring the skill requisite for its construction. But, on the other\r\nhand, it is not at all improbable that, had the mechanics of an\r\nearlier period been as skillful and as well-educated in the manual\r\nniceties of their business, the steam-engine might have been much\r\nearlier brought into use.\r\n\r\nIn the time of the Marquis of Worcester it would have probably been\r\nfound impossible to obtain workmen to construct the steam-engine of\r\nWatt, had it been then invented. Indeed, Watt, upon one occasion,\r\ncongratulated himself that one of his steam-cylinders only lacked\r\n_three-eighths_ of an inch of being truly cylindrical.\r\n\r\nThe history of the steam-engine is from this time a history of the\r\nwork of the firm of Boulton & Watt. Newcomen engines continued to be\r\nbuilt for years after Watt went to Soho, and by many builders. A host\r\nof inventors still worked on the most attractive of all mechanical\r\ncombinations, seeking to effect further improvements. Some inventions\r\nwere made by contemporaries of Watt, as will be seen hereafter, which\r\nwere important as being the germs of later growths; but these were\r\nnearly all too far in advance of the time, and nearly every successful\r\nand important invention which marked the history of steam-power for\r\nmany years originated in the fertile brain of James Watt.\r\n\r\nThe defects of the Newcomen engine were so serious, that it was no\r\nsooner known that Boulton of Soho had become interested in a new\r\nmachine for raising water by steam-power, than inquiries came to him\r\nfrom all sides, from mine-owners who were on the point of being\r\ndrowned out, and from proprietors whose profits were absorbed by the\r\nexpense of pumping, and who were glad to pay the L5 per horse-power\r\nper year finally settled upon as royalty. The London municipal\r\nwater-works authorities were also ready to negotiate for\r\npumping-engines for raising water to supply the metropolis. The firm\r\nwas therefore at once driven to make preparations for a large\r\nbusiness.\r\n\r\nThe first and most important matter, however, was to secure an\r\nextension of the patent, which was soon to expire. If not renewed, the\r\n15 years of study and toil, of poverty and anxiety, through which Watt\r\nhad toiled, would prove profitless to the inventor, and the fruits of\r\nhis genius would have become the unearned property of others. Watt\r\nsaw, at one time, little hope of securing the necessary act of\r\nParliament, and was greatly tempted to accept a position tendered him\r\nby the Russian Government, upon the solicitation of his old friend,\r\nDr. Robison, then a Professor of Mathematics at the Naval School at\r\nCronstadt. The salary was L1,000--a princely income for a man in\r\nWatt's circumstances, and a peculiar temptation to the needy\r\nmechanic.\r\n\r\nWatt, however, went to London, and, with the help of his own and of\r\nBoulton's influential friends, succeeded in getting his bill through.\r\nHis patent was extended 24 years, and Boulton & Watt set about the\r\nwork of introducing their engines with the industry and enterprise\r\nwhich characterized their every act.\r\n\r\nIn the new firm, Boulton took charge of the general business, and Watt\r\nsuperintended the design, construction, and erection of their engines.\r\nBoulton's business capacity, with Watt's wonderful mechanical\r\nability--Boulton's physical health, and his vigor and courage,\r\noffsetting Watt's feeble health and depression of spirits--and, more\r\nthan all, Boulton's pecuniary resources, both in his own purse and in\r\nthose of his friends, enabled the firm to conquer all difficulties,\r\nwhether in finance, in litigation, or in engineering.\r\n\r\nIt was only after the successful erection and operation of several\r\nengines that Boulton and Watt became legally partners. The understood\r\nterms were explicitly stated by Watt to include an assignment to\r\nBoulton of two-thirds the patent-right; Boulton paying all expenses,\r\nadvancing stock in trade at an appraised valuation, on which it was to\r\ndraw interest; Watt making all drawings and designs, and drawing\r\none-third net profits.\r\n\r\nAs soon as Watt was relieved of the uncertainties regarding his\r\nbusiness connections, he married a second wife, who, as Arago says, by\r\n\"her various talent, soundness of judgment, and strength of\r\ncharacter,\" made a worthy companion to the large-hearted and\r\nlarge-brained engineer. Thenceforward his cares were only such as\r\nevery business-man expects to be compelled to sustain, and the next\r\nten years were the most prolific in inventions of any period in Watt's\r\nlife.\r\n\r\nFrom 1775 to 1785 the partners acquired five patents, covering a large\r\nnumber of valuable improvements upon the steam-engine, and several\r\nindependent inventions. The first of these patents covered the now\r\nfamiliar and universally-used copying-press for letters, and a\r\nmachine for drying cloth by passing it between copper rollers filled\r\nwith steam of sufficiently high temperature to rapidly evaporate the\r\nmoisture. This patent was issued February 14, 1780.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 27.--Watt's Engine, 1781.]\r\n\r\nIn the following year, October 25, 1781, Watt patented five devices by\r\nwhich he obtained the rotary motion of the engine-shaft without the\r\nuse of a crank. One of these was the arrangement shown in Fig. 27, and\r\nknown as the \"sun-and-planet\" wheels. The crank-shaft carries a\r\ngear-wheel, which is engaged by another securely fixed upon the end of\r\nthe connecting-rod. As the latter is compelled to revolve about the\r\naxis of the shaft by a tie which confines the connecting-rod end at a\r\nfixed distance from the shaft, the shaft-gear is compelled to revolve,\r\nand the shaft with it. Any desired velocity-ratio was secured by\r\ngiving the two gears the necessary relative diameters. A fly-wheel was\r\nused to regulate the motion of the shaft.[39] Boulton & Watt used the\r\nsun-and-planet device on many engines, but finally adopted the crank,\r\nwhen the expiration of the patent held by Matthew Wasborough, and\r\nwhich had earlier date than Watt's patent of 1781, permitted them.\r\nWatt had proposed the use of a crank, it is said, as early as 1771,\r\nbut Wasborough anticipated him in securing the patent. Watt had made a\r\nmodel of an engine with a crank and fly-wheel, and he has stated that\r\none of his workmen, who had seen the model, described it to\r\nWasborough, thus enabling the latter to deprive Watt of his own\r\nproperty. The proceeding excited great indignation on the part of\r\nWatt; but no legal action was taken by Boulton & Watt, as the\r\noverthrow of the patent was thought likely to do them injury by\r\npermitting its use by more active competitors and more ingenious men.\r\n\r\n  [39] For the privilege of using the fly-wheel to regulate the motion\r\n  of the engine, Boulton & Watt paid a royalty to Matthew Wasborough,\r\n  who had patented it, and who held also the patent for its\r\n  combination with a crank, as invented by Pickard and Steed.\r\n\r\nThe next patent issued to Watt was an exceedingly important one, and\r\nof especial interest in a history of the development of the economical\r\napplication of steam. This patent included:\r\n\r\n1. The expansion of steam, and six methods of applying the principle\r\nand of equalizing the expansive power.\r\n\r\n2. The double-acting steam-engine, in which the steam acts on each\r\nside of the piston alternately, the opposite side being in\r\ncommunication with the condenser.\r\n\r\n3. The double or coupled steam-engine--two engines capable of working\r\ntogether, or independently, as may be desired.\r\n\r\n4. The use of a rack on the piston-rod, working into a sector on the\r\nend of the beam, thus securing a perfect rectilinear motion of the\r\nrod.\r\n\r\n5. A rotary engine, or \"steam-wheel.\"\r\n\r\nThe efficiency to be secured by the expansion of steam had long been\r\nknown to Watt, and he had conceived the idea of economizing some of\r\nthat power, the waste of which was so plainly indicated by the violent\r\nrushing of the exhaust-steam into the condenser, as early as 1769.\r\nThis was described in a letter to Dr. Small, of Birmingham, in May of\r\nthat year. When experimenting at Kinneil, he had tried to determine\r\nthe real value of the principle by trial on his small engine.\r\n\r\nBoulton had also recognized the importance of this improved method of\r\nworking steam, and their earlier Soho engines were, as Watt said, made\r\nwith cylinders \"double the size wanted, and cut off the steam at\r\nhalf-stroke.\" But, though \"this was a great saving of steam, so long\r\nas the valves remained as at first,\" the builders were so constantly\r\nannoyed by alterations of the valves by proprietors and their\r\nengineers, that they finally gave up that method of working, hoping\r\nultimately to be able to resume it when workmen of greater\r\nintelligence and reliability could be found. The patent was issued\r\nJuly 17, 1782.\r\n\r\nWatt specified a cut-off at one-quarter stroke as usually best.\r\n\r\nWatt's explanation of the method of economizing by expansive working,\r\nas given to Dr. Small,[40] is worthy of reproduction. He says: \"I\r\nmentioned to you a method of still doubling the effect of steam, and\r\nthat tolerably easy, by using the power of steam rushing into a\r\nvacuum, at present lost. This would do a little more than double the\r\neffect, but it would too much enlarge the vessels to use it all. It is\r\npeculiarly applicable to wheel-engines, and may supply the want of a\r\ncondenser where force of steam is only used; for, open one of the\r\nsteam-valves and admit steam, until one-fourth of the distance between\r\nit and the next valve is filled with steam, shut the valve, and the\r\nsteam will continue to expand and to pass round the wheel with a\r\ndiminishing power, ending in one-fourth its first exertion. The sum of\r\nthis series you will find greater than one-half, though only\r\none-fourth steam was used. The power will indeed be unequal, but this\r\ncan be remedied by a fly, or in several other ways.\"\r\n\r\n  [40] \"Lives of Boulton and Watt,\" Smiles.\r\n\r\nIt will be noticed that Watt suggests, above, the now well-known\r\nnon-condensing engine. He had already, as has been seen, described it\r\nin his patent of 1769, as also the rotary engine.\r\n\r\nWatt illustrates and explains his idea very neatly, by a sketch\r\nsimilar to that here given (Fig. 28).\r\n\r\nSteam, entering the cylinder at _a_, is admitted until one-fourth the\r\nstroke has been made, when the steam-valve is closed, and the\r\nremainder of the stroke is performed without further addition of\r\nsteam. The variation of steam-pressure is approximately inversely\r\nproportional to the variation of its volume. Thus, at half-stroke, the\r\npressure becomes one-half that at which the steam was supplied to the\r\ncylinder. At the end of the stroke it has fallen to one-fourth the\r\ninitial pressure. The pressure is always nearly equal to the product\r\nof the initial pressure and volume divided by the volume at the given\r\ninstant. In symbols,\r\n\r\n         _PV_\r\n  _P'_ = ----.\r\n         _V'_\r\n\r\nIt is true that the condensation of steam doing work changes this law\r\nin a marked manner; but the condensation and reevaporation of steam,\r\ndue to the transfer of heat to and from the metal of the cylinder,\r\ntends to compensate the first variation by a reverse change of\r\npressure with change of volume.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 28.--Expansion of Steam.]\r\n\r\nThe sketch shows this progressive variation of pressure as expansion\r\nproceeds. It is seen that the work done per unit of volume of steam as\r\ntaken from the boiler is much greater than when working without\r\nexpansion. The product of the mean pressure by the volume of the\r\ncylinder is less, but the quotient obtained by dividing this quantity\r\nby the volume or weight of steam taken from the boiler, is much\r\ngreater with than without expansion. For the case assumed and\r\nillustrated, the work done during expansion is one and two-fifths\r\ntimes that done previous to cutting off the steam, and the work done\r\nper pound of steam is 2.4 times that done without expansion.\r\n\r\nWere there no losses to be met with and to be exaggerated by the use\r\nof steam expansively, the gain would become very great with moderate\r\nexpansion, amounting to twice the work done when \"following\" full\r\nstroke, when the steam is cut off at one-seventh. The estimated gain\r\nis, however, never realized. Losses by friction, by conduction and\r\nradiation of heat, and by condensation and reevaporation in the\r\ncylinder--of which losses the latter are most serious--after passing a\r\npoint which is variable, and which is determined by the special\r\nconditions in each case, augment with greater rapidity than the gain\r\nby expansion.\r\n\r\nIn actual practice, it is rarely found, except where special\r\nprecautions are taken to reduce these losses, that economy follows\r\nexpansion to a greater number of volumes than about one-half the\r\nsquare root of the steam-pressure; i. e., about twice for 15 or 20\r\npounds pressure, three times for about 30 pounds, and four and five\r\ntimes for 60 or 65 and for 100 to 125 pounds respectively. Watt very\r\nsoon learned this general principle; but neither he, nor even many\r\nmodern engineers, seem to have learned that too great expansion often\r\ngives greatly-reduced economy.\r\n\r\nThe inequality of pressure due to expansion, to which he refers, was a\r\nsource of much perplexity to Watt, as he was for a long time convinced\r\nthat he must find some method of \"equalizing\" the consequent irregular\r\neffort of the steam upon the piston. The several methods of\r\n\"equalizing the expansive power\" which are referred to in the patent\r\nwere attempts to secure this result. By one method, he shifted the\r\ncentre as the beam vibrated, thus changing the lengths of the arms of\r\nthat great lever, to compensate the change of moment consequent upon\r\nthe change of pressure. He finally concluded that a fly-wheel, as\r\nfirst proposed by Fitzgerald, who advised its use on Papin's engine,\r\nwould be the best device on engines driving a crank, and trusted to\r\nthe inertia of a balance-weight in his pumping-engines, or to the\r\nweight of the pump-rods, and permitted the piston to take its own\r\nspeed so far as it was not thus controlled.\r\n\r\nThe double-acting engine was a modification of the single-acting\r\nengine, and was very soon determined upon after the successful working\r\nof the latter had become assured.\r\n\r\nWatt had covered in the top of his single-acting engine, to prevent\r\ncooling the interior of the cylinder by contact with the comparatively\r\ncold atmosphere. When this had been done, there was but a single step\r\nrequired to convert the machine into the double-acting engine. This\r\nalteration, by which the steam was permitted to act upon the upper and\r\nthe lower sides of the piston alternately, had been proposed by Watt\r\nas early as 1767, and a drawing of the engine was laid before a\r\ncommittee of the House of Commons in 1774-'75. By this simple change\r\nWatt doubled the power of his engine. Although invented much earlier,\r\nthe plan was not patented until he was, as he states, driven to take\r\nout the patent by the \"plagiarists and pirates\" who were always ready\r\nto profit by his ingenuity. This form of engine is now almost\r\nuniversally used. The single-acting pumping-engine remains in use in\r\nCornwall, and in a few other localities, and now and then an engine is\r\nbuilt for other purposes, in which steam acts only on one side of the\r\npiston; but these are rare exceptions to the general rule.\r\n\r\nThe subject of his next invention was not less interesting. The\r\ndouble-cylinder or \"compound\" engine has now, after the lapse of\r\nnearly a century, become an important and usual type of engine. It is\r\nimpossible to determine precisely to whom to award the credit of its\r\nfirst conception. Dr. Falk, in 1779, had proposed a double-acting\r\nengine, in which there were two single-acting cylinders, acting in\r\nopposite directions and alternately on opposite sides of a wheel, with\r\nwhich a rack on the piston-rod of each geared.\r\n\r\nWatt claimed that Hornblower, the patentee of the \"compound engine,\"\r\nwas an infringer upon his patents; and, holding the patent on the\r\nseparate condenser, he was able to prevent the engine of his\r\ncompetitor taking such form as to be successfully introduced. The\r\nHornblower engine was soon given up.\r\n\r\nWatt stated that this form of engine had been invented by him as early\r\nas 1767, and that he had explained its peculiarities to Smeaton and\r\nothers several years before Hornblower attempted to use it. He wrote\r\nto Boulton: \"It is no less than our double-cylinder engine, worked\r\nupon our principle of expansion.\" He never made use of the plan,\r\nhowever; and the principal object sought, apparently, in patenting\r\nthis, as well as many other devices, was to secure himself against\r\ncompetition.\r\n\r\nThe rack and sector patented at this time was soon superseded by the\r\nparallel-motion; and the last claim, the \"steam-wheel\" or rotary\r\nengine, although one was built of considerable size, was not\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\nAfter the patent of 1782 had been secured, Watt turned his attention,\r\nwhen not too hard-pressed by business, to other schemes, and to\r\nexperimenting with still other modifications and applications of his\r\nengine. He had, as early as 1777, proposed to make a steam-hammer for\r\nWilkinson's forge; but he was too closely engaged with more important\r\nmatters to take hold of the project with much earnestness until late\r\nin the year 1782, when, after some preliminary trials, he reported,\r\nDecember 13th: \"We have tried our little tilting-forge hammer at Soho\r\nwith success. The following are some of the particulars: Cylinder, 15\r\ninches in diameter; 4 feet stroke; strokes per minute, 20. The\r\nhammer-head, 120 pounds weight, rises 8 inches, and strikes 240 blows\r\nper minute. The machine goes quite regularly, and can be managed as\r\neasily as a water-mill. It requires a very small quantity of\r\nsteam--not above half the contents of the cylinder per stroke. The\r\npower employed is not more than one-fourth of what would be required\r\nto raise the quantity of water which would enable a water-wheel to\r\nwork the same hammer with the same velocity.\"\r\n\r\nHe immediately set about making a much heavier hammer, and on April\r\n26, 1783, he wrote that he had done \"a thing never done\r\nbefore\"--making his hammer strike 300 blows a minute. This hammer\r\nweighed 7-1/2 hundredweight, and had a drop of 2 feet. The\r\nsteam-cylinder had a diameter of 42 inches and 6 feet stroke of\r\npiston, and was calculated to have sufficient power to drive four\r\nhammers weighing 7 hundredweight each. The engine made 20 strokes per\r\nminute, the hammer giving 90 blows in the same time.\r\n\r\nThis new application of steam-power proving successful, Watt next\r\nbegan to develop a series of minor inventions, which were finally\r\nsecured by his patent of April 27, 1784, together with the steam\r\ntilt-hammer, and a steam-carriage, or \"locomotive engine.\"\r\n\r\nThe contrivance previously used for guiding the head of the\r\npiston-rod--the sectors and chains, or rack--had never given\r\nsatisfaction. The rudeness of design of the contrivance was only\r\nequalled by its insecurity. Watt therefore contrived a number of\r\nmethods of accomplishing the purpose, the most beautiful and\r\nwidely-known of which is the \"parallel-motion,\" although it has now\r\nbeen generally superseded by one of the other devices patented at the\r\nsame time--the cross-head and guides. As originally proposed, a rod\r\nwas attached to the head of the piston-rod, standing vertically when\r\nthe latter was at quarter-stroke. The upper end of this rod was\r\npivoted to the end of the beam, and the lower end to the extremity of\r\na horizontal rod having a length equal to one-half the length of the\r\nbeam. The other end of the horizontal rod was coupled to the frame of\r\nthe engine. As the piston rose and fell, the upper and lower ends of\r\nthe vertical rod were swayed in opposite directions, and to an equal\r\nextent, by the beam and the lower horizontal rod, the middle point at\r\nwhich the piston-rod was attached preserving its position in the\r\nvertical line. This form was objectionable, as the whole effort of the\r\nengine was transmitted through the parallel-motion rods. Another form\r\nis shown in the sketch given of the double-acting engine in Fig. 31,\r\nwhich was free from this defect. The head of the piston-rod, _g_, was\r\nguided by rods connecting it with the frame at _c_, and forming a\r\n\"parallelogram,\" _g d e b_, with the beam. Many varieties of\r\n\"parallel-motion\" have been devised since Watt's invention was\r\nattached to his engines at Soho. They usually are more or less\r\nimperfect, guiding the piston-rod in a line only approximately\r\nstraight.\r\n\r\nThe cross-head and guides are now generally used, very much as\r\ndescribed by Watt in this patent as his \"second principle.\" This\r\ndevice will be seen in the engravings given hereafter of more modern\r\nengines. The head of the piston-rod is fitted into a transverse bar,\r\nor cross-head, which carries properly-shaped pieces at its\r\nextremities, to which are bolted \"gibs,\" so made as to fit upon guides\r\nsecured to the engine-frame. These guides are adjusted to precise\r\nparallelism with the centre line of the cylinder. The cross-head,\r\nsliding in or on these guides, moves in a perfectly straight line,\r\nand, compelling the piston-rod to move with it, the latter is even\r\nmore perfectly guided than by a parallel-motion. This arrangement,\r\nwhere properly proportioned, is not necessarily subject to great\r\nfriction, and is much more easily adjusted and kept in line than the\r\nparallel-motion when wear occurs or maladjustment takes place.\r\n\r\nBy the same patent, Watt secured the now common \"puppet-valve\" with\r\nbeveled seat, and the application of the steam-engine to driving\r\nrolling-mills and hammers for forges, and to \"wheel-carriages for\r\nremoving persons or goods, or other matters, from place to place.\" For\r\nthe latter purpose he proposes to use boilers \"of wood, or of thin\r\nmetal, strongly secured by hoops or otherwise,\" and containing\r\n\"internal fire-boxes.\" He proposed to use a condenser cooled by\r\ncurrents of air.\r\n\r\nIt would require too much space to follow Watt in all his schemes for\r\nthe improvement and for the application of the steam-engine. A few of\r\nthe more important and more ingenious only can be described. Many of\r\nthe contracts of Boulton & Watt gave them, as compensation for their\r\nengines, a fraction--usually one-third--of the value of the fuel saved\r\nby the use of the Watt engine in place of the engine of Newcomen, the\r\namount due being paid annually or semiannually, with an option of\r\nredemption on the part of the purchaser at ten years' purchase. This\r\nform of agreement compelled a careful determination, often, of the\r\nwork done and fuel consumed by both the engine taken out and that put\r\nin its place. It was impossible to rely upon any determination by\r\npersonal observation of the number of strokes made by the engine. Watt\r\ntherefore made a \"counter,\" like that now familiar to every one as\r\nused on gas-meters. It consists of a train of wheels moving pointers\r\non several dials, the first dial showing tens, the second hundreds,\r\nthe third thousands, etc., strokes or revolutions. Motion was\r\ncommunicated to the train by means of a pendulum, the whole being\r\nmounted on the beam of the engine, where every vibration produced a\r\nswing of the pendulum. Eight dials were sometimes used, the counter\r\nbeing set and locked, and only opened once a year, when the time\r\narrived for determining the work done during the preceding\r\ntwelve-month.\r\n\r\nThe application of his engine to purposes for which careful adjustment\r\nof speed was requisite, or where the load was subject to considerable\r\nvariation, led to the use of a controlling-valve in the steam-pipe,\r\ncalled the \"throttle-valve,\" which was adjustable by hand, and\r\npermitted the supply of steam to the engine to be adjusted at any\r\ninstant and altered to any desired extent. It is now given many forms,\r\nbut it still is most usually made just as originally designed by Watt.\r\nIt consists of a circular disk, which just closes up the steam-pipe\r\nwhen set directly across it, or of an elliptical disk, which closes\r\nthe pipe when standing at an angle of somewhat less than 90 deg. with the\r\nline of the pipe. This disk is carried on a spindle extending through\r\nthe pipe at one side, and carrying on its outer end an arm by means\r\nof which it may be turned into any position. When placed with its face\r\nin line with the pipe, it offers very little resistance to the flow of\r\nsteam to the engine. When set in the other position, it shuts off\r\nsteam entirely and stops the engine. It is placed in such position at\r\nany time, that the speed of the engine is just that required at the\r\ntime. In the engraving of the double-acting engine with fly-wheel\r\n(Fig. 31), it is shown at _T_, as controlled by the governor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 29.--The Governor.]\r\n\r\nThe governor, or \"fly-ball governor,\" as it is often distinctively\r\ncalled, was another of Watt's minor but very essential inventions. Two\r\nheavy iron or brass balls, _B B'_, were suspended from pins, _C C'_,\r\nin a little cross-piece carried on the head of a vertical spindle, _A\r\nA'_, driven by the engine. The speed of the engine varying, that of\r\nthe spindle changed correspondingly, and the faster the balls were\r\nswung the farther they separated. When the engine's speed decreased,\r\nthe period of revolution of the balls was increased, and they fell\r\nback toward the spindle. Whenever the velocity of the engine was\r\nuniform, the balls preserved their distance from the spindle and\r\nremained at the same height, their altitude being determined by the\r\nrelation existing between the force of gravity and centrifugal force\r\nin the temporary position of equilibrium. The distance from the point\r\nof suspension down to the level of the balls is always equal to 9.78\r\ninches divided by the square of the number of revolutions per\r\nsecond--i. e., _h_ = 9.78 (1/_N_^2) = 0.248 (1/_N_^2) meters.\r\n\r\nThe arms carrying the balls, or the balls themselves, are pinned to\r\nrods, _M M'_, which are connected to a piece, _N N'_, sliding loosely\r\non the spindle. A score, _T_, cut in this piece engages a lever, _V_,\r\nand, as the balls rise and fall, a rod, _W_, is moved, closing and\r\nopening the throttle-valve, and thus adjusting the supply of steam in\r\nsuch a way as to preserve a nearly fixed speed of engine. The\r\nconnection with the throttle-valve and with the cut-off valve-gear is\r\nseen not only in the engraving of the double-acting Watt engine, but\r\nalso in those of the Greene and the Corliss engines. This contrivance\r\nhad previously been used in regulating water-wheels and windmills.\r\nWatt's invention consisted in its application to the regulation of the\r\nsteam-engine.\r\n\r\nStill another useful invention of Watt's was his \"mercury\r\nsteam-gauge\"--a barometer in which the height of the mercury was\r\ndetermined by the pressure of the steam instead of that of the\r\natmosphere. This simple instrument consisted merely of a bent tube\r\ncontaining a portion of mercury. One leg, _B D_, of this U-tube was\r\nconnected with the steam-pipe, or with the boiler by a small\r\nsteam-pipe; the other end, _C_, was open to the atmosphere. The\r\npressure of the steam on the mercury in _B D_ caused it to rise in the\r\nother \"leg\" to a height exactly proportioned to the pressure, and\r\ncausing very nearly two inches difference of level to the pound, or\r\none inch to the pound actual rise in the outer leg. The rude sketch\r\nfrom Farey, here given (Fig. 30), indicates sufficiently well the form\r\nof this gauge. It is still considered by engineers the most reliable\r\nof all forms of steam-gauge. Unfortunately, it is not conveniently\r\napplicable at high pressure. The scale, _A_, is marked with numbers\r\nindicating the pressure, which numbers are indicated by the head of a\r\nrod floating up with the mercury.\r\n\r\nA similar gauge was used to determine the degree of perfection of\r\nvacuum attained in the condenser, the mercury falling in the outer leg\r\nas the vacuum became more complete. A perfect vacuum would cause a\r\ndepression of level in that leg to 30 inches below the level of the\r\nmercury in the leg connected with the condenser. In a more usual form,\r\nit consisted of a simple glass tube having its lower end immersed in a\r\ncistern of mercury, as in the ordinary barometer, the top of the tube\r\nbeing connected with a pipe leading to the condenser. With a perfect\r\nvacuum in the condenser, the mercury would rise in the tube very\r\nnearly 30 inches. Ordinarily, the vacuum is not nearly perfect, and, a\r\nback pressure remaining in the condenser of one or two pounds per\r\nsquare inch, the atmospheric pressure remaining unbalanced is only\r\nsufficient to raise the mercury 26 or 28 inches above the level of the\r\nliquid metal in the cistern.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 30. Mercury Steam Gauge. Glass Water Gauge.]\r\n\r\nTo determine the height of water in his boiler, Watt added to the\r\ngauge-cocks already long in use the \"glass water-gauge,\" which is\r\nstill seen in nearly every well-arranged boiler. This was a glass\r\ntube, _a a'_ (Fig. 30), mounted on a standard attached to the front of\r\nthe boiler, and at such a height that its middle point was very little\r\nbelow the proposed water-level. It was connected by a small pipe, _r_,\r\nat the top to the steam-space, and another little pipe, _r'_, led into\r\nthe boiler from its lower end below the water-line. As the water rose\r\nand fell within the boiler, its level changed correspondingly in the\r\nglass. This little instrument is especially liked, because the\r\nposition of the water is at all times shown to the eye of the\r\nattendant. If carefully protected against sudden changes of\r\ntemperature, it answers perfectly well with even very high pressures.\r\n\r\nThe engines built by Boulton & Watt were finally fitted with the crank\r\nand fly-wheel for application to the driving of mills and machinery.\r\nThe accompanying engraving (Fig. 31) shows the engine as thus made,\r\ncombining all of the essential improvements designed by its inventor.\r\n\r\nIn the engraving, _C_ is the steam-cylinder, _P_ the piston, connected\r\nto the beam by the link, _g_, and guided by the parallel-motion, _g d\r\nc_. At the opposite end of the beam a connecting-rod, _O_, connects\r\nwith the crank and fly-wheel shaft. _R_ is the rod of the air-pump, by\r\nmeans of which the condenser is kept from being flooded by the water\r\nused for condensation, which water-supply is regulated by an\r\n\"injection-handle,\" _E_. A pump-rod, _N_, leads down from the beam to\r\nthe cold-water pump, by which water is raised from the well or other\r\nsource to supply the needed injection-water. The air-pump rod also\r\nserves as a \"plug-rod,\" to work the valves, the pins at _m_ and _R_\r\nstriking the lever, _m_, at either end of the stroke. When the piston\r\nreaches the top of the cylinder, the lever, _m_, is raised, opening\r\nthe steam-valve, _B_, at the top, and the exhaust-valve, _E_, at the\r\nbottom, and at the same time closing the exhaust at the top and the\r\nsteam at the bottom. When the entrance of steam at the top and the\r\nremoval of steam-pressure below the piston has driven the piston to\r\nthe bottom, the pin, _R_, strikes the lever, _m_, opening the steam\r\nand closing the exhaust valve at the bottom, and similarly reversing\r\nthe position of the valves at the top. The position of the valves is\r\nchanged in this manner with every reversal of the motion of the piston\r\nas the crank \"turns over the centre.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 31.--Boulton & Watt's Double-Acting Engine, 1784.]\r\n\r\nThe earliest engines of the double-acting kind, and of any\r\nconsiderable size, which were built to turn a shaft, were those which\r\nwere set up in the Albion Mills, near Blackfriars' Bridge, London, in\r\n1786, and destroyed when the mills burned down in 1791. There were a\r\npair of these engines (shown in Fig. 27), of 50 horse-power each, and\r\ngeared to drive 20 pairs of stones, making fine flour and meal.\r\nPrevious to the erection of this mill the power in all such\r\nestablishments had been derived from windmills and water-wheels. This\r\nmill was erected by Boulton & Watt, and capitalists working with\r\nthem, not only to secure the profit anticipated from locating a\r\nflour-mill in the city of London, but also with a view to exhibiting\r\nthe capacity of the new double-acting \"rotating\" engine. The plan was\r\nproposed in 1783, and work was commenced in 1784; but the mill was not\r\nset in operation until the spring of 1786. The capacity of the mill\r\nwas, in ordinary work, 16,000 bushels of wheat ground into fine flour\r\nper week. On one occasion, the mill turned out 3,000 bushels in 24\r\nhours. In the construction of the machinery of the mill, many\r\nimprovements upon the then standard practice were introduced,\r\nincluding cast-iron gearing with carefully-formed teeth and iron\r\nframing. It was here that John Rennie commenced his work, after\r\npassing through his apprenticeship in Scotland, sending his chief\r\nassistant, Ewart, to superintend the erection of the milling\r\nmachinery. The mill was a success as a piece of engineering, but a\r\nserious loss was incurred by the capitalists engaged in the\r\nenterprise, as it was set on fire a few years afterward and entirely\r\ndestroyed. Boulton and Watt were the principal losers, the former\r\nlosing L6,000, and the latter L3,000.\r\n\r\nThe valve-gear of this engine, a view of which is given in Fig. 27,\r\nwas quite similar to that used on the Watt pumping-engine. The\r\naccompanying illustration (Fig. 32) represents this valve-motion as\r\nattached to the Albion Mills engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 32.--Valve-Gear of the Albion Mills Engine.]\r\n\r\nThe steam-pipe, _a b d d e_, leads the steam from the boiler to the\r\nchambers, _b_ and _e_. The exhaust-pipe, _g g_, leads from _h_ and _i_\r\nto the condenser. In the sketch, the upper steam and the lower exhaust\r\nvalves, _b_ and _f_, are opened, and the steam-valve, _e_, and\r\nexhaust-valve, _c_, are closed, the piston being near the upper end of\r\nthe cylinder and descending. _l_ represents the plug-frame, which\r\ncarries tappets, 2 and 3, which engage the lever, _s_, at either end\r\nof its throw, and turn the shaft, _u_, thus opening and closing _c_\r\nand _e_ simultaneously by means of the connecting-links, 13 and 14. A\r\nsimilar pair of tappets on the opposite side of the plug-rod move the\r\nvalves, _b_ and _f_, by means of the rods, 10 and 11, the arm, _r_,\r\nwhen struck by those tappets, turning the shaft, _t_, and thus moving\r\nthe arms to which those rods are attached. Counterbalance-weights,\r\ncarried on the ends of the arms, 4 and 15, retain the valves on their\r\nseats when closed by the action of the tappets. When the piston nearly\r\nreaches the lower end of the cylinder, the tappet, 1, engages the arm,\r\n_r_, closing the steam-valve, _b_, and the next instant shutting the\r\nexhaust-valve, _f_. At the same time, the tappet, 3, by moving the\r\narm, _s_, downward, opens the steam-valve, _e_, and the exhaust-valve,\r\n_c_. Steam now no longer issues from the steam-pipe into the space,\r\n_c_, and thence into the engine-cylinder (not shown in the sketch);\r\nbut it now enters the engine through the valve, _e_, forcing the\r\npiston upwards. The exhaust is simultaneously made to occur at the\r\nupper end, the rejected steam passing from the engine into the space,\r\n_c_, and thence through _c_ and the pipe, _g_, into the condenser.\r\n\r\nThis kind of valve-gear was subsequently greatly improved by Murdoch,\r\nWatt's ingenious and efficient foreman, but it is now entirely\r\nsuperseded on engines of this class by the eccentric, and the various\r\nforms of valve-gear driven by it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 33.--Watt's Half-Trunk Engine, 1784.]\r\n\r\nThe \"trunk-engine\" was still another of the almost innumerable\r\ninventions of Watt. A half-trunk engine is described in his patent of\r\n1784, as shown in the accompanying sketch (Fig. 33), in which _A_ is\r\nthe cylinder, _B_ the piston, and _C_ its rod, encased in the\r\nhalf-trunk, _D_. The plug-rod, _G_, moves the single pair of valves by\r\nstriking the catches, _E_ and _F_, as was usual with Watt's earlier\r\nengines.\r\n\r\nWatt's steam-hammer was patented at the same time. It is seen in Fig.\r\n34, in which _A_ is the steam-cylinder and _B_ its rod, the engine\r\nbeing evidently of the form just described. It works a beam, _C C_,\r\nwhich in turn, by the rod, _M_, works the hammer-helve, _L J_, and the\r\nhammer, _L_. The beam, _F G_, is a spring, and the block, _N_, the\r\nanvil.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 34.--The Watt Hammer, 1784.]\r\n\r\nWatt found it impossible to determine the duty of his engines at all\r\ntimes by measurement of the work itself, and endeavored to find a way\r\nof ascertaining the power produced, by ascertaining the pressure of\r\nsteam within the cylinder. This pressure was so variable, and subject\r\nto such rapid as well as extreme fluctuations, that he found it\r\nimpossible to make use of the steam-gauge constructed for use on the\r\nboiler. He was thus driven to invent a special instrument for this\r\nwork, which he called the \"steam-engine indicator.\" This consisted of\r\na little steam-cylinder containing a nicely-fitting piston, which\r\nmoved without noticeable friction through a range which was limited by\r\nthe compression of a helical spring, by means of which the piston was\r\nsecured to the top of its cylinder. The distance through which the\r\npiston rose was proportional to the pressure exerted upon it, and a\r\npointer attached to its rod traversed a scale upon which the pressure\r\nper square inch could be read. The lower end of the instrument being\r\nconnected with the steam-cylinder of the engine by a small pipe\r\nfitted with a cock, the opening of the latter permitted steam from the\r\nengine-cylinder to fill the indicator-cylinder, and the pressure of\r\nsteam was always the same in both cylinders. The indicator-pointer\r\ntherefore traversed the pressure-scale, always exhibiting the pressure\r\nexisting at the instant in the cylinder of the engine. When the engine\r\nwas at rest and steam off, the indicator-piston stood at the same\r\nlevel as when detached from the engine, and the pointer stood at 0 on\r\nthe scale. When steam entered, the piston rose and fell with the\r\nfluctuations of pressure; and when the exhaust-valve opened,\r\ndischarging the steam and producing a vacuum in the steam-cylinder,\r\nthe pointer of the indicator dropped below 0, showing the degree of\r\nexhaustion. Mr. Southern, one of Watt's assistants, fitted the\r\ninstrument with a sliding board, moved horizontally backward and\r\nforward by a cord or link-work connecting directly or indirectly with\r\nthe engine-beam, and thus giving it a motion coincident with that of\r\nthe piston. This board carried a piece of paper, upon which a pencil\r\nattached to the indicator piston-rod drew a curve. The vertical height\r\nof any point on this curve above the base-line measured the pressure\r\nin the cylinder at the moment when it was made, and the horizontal\r\ndistance of the point from either end of the diagram determined the\r\nposition, at the same moment, of the engine-piston. The curve thus\r\ninscribed, called the \"indicator card,\" or indicator diagram,\r\nexhibiting every minute change in the pressure of steam in the engine,\r\nnot only enabled the mean pressure and the power of the engine to be\r\ndetermined by its measurement, but, to the eye of the expert engineer,\r\nit was a perfectly legible statement of the position of the valves of\r\nthe engine, and revealed almost every defect in the action of the\r\nengine which could not readily be detected by external examination. It\r\nhas justly been called the \"engineers' stethoscope,\" opening the\r\notherwise inaccessible parts of the steam-engine to the inspection of\r\nthe engineer even more satisfactorily than the stethoscope of the\r\nphysician gives him a knowledge of the condition and working of organs\r\ncontained within the human body. This indispensable and now familiar\r\nengineers' instrument has since been modified and greatly improved in\r\ndetail.\r\n\r\nThe Watt engine had, by the construction of the improvements described\r\nin the patents of 1782-'85, been given its distinctive form, and the\r\ngreat inventor subsequently did little more than improve it by\r\naltering the forms and proportions of its details. As thus practically\r\ncompleted, it embodied nearly all the essential features of the modern\r\nengine; and, as we have seen, the marked features of our latest\r\npractice--the use of the double cylinder for expansion, the cut-off\r\nvalve-gear, and surface-condensation--had all been proposed, and to a\r\nlimited extent introduced. The growth of the steam-engine has here\r\nceased to be rapid, and the changes which followed the completion of\r\nthe work of James Watt have been minor improvements, and rarely, if\r\never, real developments.\r\n\r\nWatt's mind lost none of its activity, however, for many years. He\r\ndevised and patented a \"smoke-consuming furnace,\" in which he led the\r\ngases produced on the introduction of fresh fuel over the already\r\nincandescent coal, and thus burned them completely. He used two fires,\r\nwhich were coaled alternately. Even when busiest, also, he found time\r\nto pursue more purely scientific studies. With Boulton, he induced a\r\nnumber of well-known scientific men living near Birmingham to join in\r\nthe formation of a \"Lunar Society,\" to meet monthly at the houses of\r\nits members, \"at the full of the moon.\" The time was thus fixed in\r\norder that those members who came from a distance should be able to\r\ndrive home, after the meetings, by moonlight. Many such societies were\r\nthen in existence in England; but that at Birmingham was one of the\r\nlargest and most distinguished of them all. Boulton, Watt, Drs. Small,\r\nDarwin, and Priestley, were the leaders, and among their occasional\r\nvisitors were Herschel, Smeaton, and Banks. Watt called these meetings\r\n\"Philosophers' meetings.\" It was during the period of most active\r\ndiscussion at the \"philosophers' meetings\" that Cavendish and\r\nPriestley were experimenting with mixtures of oxygen and hydrogen, to\r\ndetermine the nature of their combustion. Watt took much interest in\r\nthe subject, and, when informed by Priestley that he and Cavendish had\r\nboth noticed a deposit of moisture invariably succeeding the explosion\r\nof the mixed gases, when contained in a cold vessel, and that the\r\nweight of this water was approximately equal to the weight of the\r\nmixed gases, he at once came to the conclusion that the union of\r\nhydrogen with oxygen produced water, the latter being a chemical\r\ncompound, of which the former were constituents. He communicated this\r\nreasoning, and the conclusions to which it had led him, to Boulton, in\r\na letter written in December, 1782, and addressed a letter some time\r\nafterward to Priestley, which was to have been read before the Royal\r\nSociety in April, 1783. The letter was not read, however, until a year\r\nlater, and, three months after, a paper by Cavendish, making the same\r\nannouncement, had been laid before the Society. Watt stated that both\r\nCavendish and Lavoisier, to whom also the discovery is ascribed,\r\nreceived the idea from him.\r\n\r\nThe action of chlorine in bleaching organic coloring-matters, by (as\r\nsince shown) decomposing them and combining with their hydrogen, was\r\nmade known to Watt by M. Berthollet, the distinguished French chemist,\r\nand the former immediately introduced its use into Great Britain, by\r\ninducing his father-in-law, Mr. Macgregor, to make a trial of it.\r\n\r\nThe copartnership of Boulton & Watt terminated by limitation, and with\r\nthe expiration of the patents under which they had been working, in\r\nthe first year of the present century; and both partners, now old and\r\nfeeble, withdrew from active business, leaving their sons to renew the\r\nagreement and to carry on the business under the same firm-style.\r\n\r\nBoulton, however, still interested himself in some branches of\r\nmanufacture, especially in his mint, where he had coined many years\r\nand for several nations.\r\n\r\nWatt retired, a little later, to Heathfield, where he passed the\r\nremainder of his life in peaceful enjoyment of the society of his\r\nfriends, in studies of all current matters of interest in science, as\r\nwell as in engineering. One by one his old friends died--Black in\r\n1799, Priestley, an exile to America, in 1803, and Robison a little\r\nlater. Boulton died, at the age of eighty-one, August 17, 1809, and\r\neven the loss of this nearest and dearest of his friends outside the\r\nfamily was a less severe blow than that of his son Gregory, who died\r\nin 1804.\r\n\r\nYet the great engineer and inventor was not depressed by the\r\nloneliness which was gradually coming upon him. He wrote: \"I know that\r\nall men must die, and I submit to the decrees of Nature, I hope, with\r\ndue reverence to the Disposer of events;\" and neglected no opportunity\r\nto secure amusement or instruction, and kept body and mind constantly\r\noccupied. He still attended the weekly meetings of the club, meeting\r\nRennie and Telford, and other distinguished men of his own and the\r\nsucceeding generation. He lost nothing of his fondness for invention,\r\nand spent many months in devising a machine for copying statuary,\r\nwhich he had not perfected to his own satisfaction at the time of his\r\ndeath, ten years later. This machine was a kind of pentagraph, which\r\ncould be worked in any plane, and in which the marking-pencil gave\r\nplace to a cutting-tool. The tracing-point followed the surface of the\r\npattern, while the cutting-point, following its motion precisely,\r\nformed a fac-simile in the material operated upon.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1800 he invented the water-main which was laid down by the\r\nGlasgow Water-Works Company across the Clyde. The joints were\r\nspherical and articulated, like those of the lobster's tail.\r\n\r\nHis workshop, of which a sketch is hereafter given, as drawn by the\r\nartist Skelton, was in the garret of his house, and was well supplied\r\nwith tools and all kinds of laboratory material. His lathe and his\r\ncopying-machine were placed before the window, and his writing-desk in\r\nthe corner. Here he spent the greater part of his leisure time, often\r\neven taking his meals in the little shop, rather than go to the table\r\nfor them. Even when very old, he occasionally made a journey to London\r\nor Glasgow, calling on his old friends and studying the latest\r\nengineering devices and inspecting public works, and was everywhere\r\nwelcomed by young and old as the greatest living engineer, or as the\r\nkind and wise friend of earlier days.\r\n\r\nHe died August 19, 1819, in the eighty-third year of his age, and was\r\nburied in Handsworth Church. The sculptor Chantrey was employed to\r\nplace a fitting monument above his grave, and the nation erected a\r\nstatue of the great man in Westminster Abbey.\r\n\r\nThis sketch of the greatest of all the inventors of the steam-engine\r\nhas been given no greater length than its subject justifies. Whether\r\nwe consider Watt as the inventor of the standard steam-engine of the\r\nnineteenth century, as the scientific investigator of the physical\r\nprinciples upon which the invention is based, or as the builder and\r\nintroducer of the most powerful known instrument by which the \"great\r\nsources of power in Nature are converted, adapted, and applied for the\r\nuse and convenience of man,\" he is fully entitled to preeminence. His\r\ncharacter as a man was no less admirable than as an engineer.\r\n\r\nSmiles, Watt's most conscientious and indefatigable biographer,\r\nwrites:[41]\r\n\r\n  [41] \"Life of Watt,\" p. 512.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 35.--James Watt's Workshop. (From Smiles's \"Lives\r\nof Boulton and Watt.\")]\r\n\r\n\"Some months since, we visited the little garret at Heathfield in\r\nwhich Watt pursued the investigations of his later years. The room had\r\nbeen carefully locked up since his death, and had only once been swept\r\nout. Everything lay very much as he left it. The piece of iron which\r\nhe was last employed in turning, lay on the lathe. The ashes of the\r\nlast fire were in the grate; the last bit of coal was in the scuttle.\r\nThe Dutch oven was in its place over the stove, and the frying-pan in\r\nwhich he cooked his meals was hanging on its accustomed nail. Many\r\nobjects lay about or in the drawers, indicating the pursuits which had\r\nbeen interrupted by death--busts, medallions, and figures, waiting to\r\nbe copied by the copying-machine--many medallion-moulds, a store of\r\nplaster-of-Paris, and a box of plaster casts from London, the contents\r\nof which do not seem to have been disturbed. Here are Watt's ladles\r\nfor melting lead, his foot-rule, his glue-pot, his hammer. Reflecting\r\nmirrors, an extemporized camera with the lenses mounted on pasteboard,\r\nand many camera-glasses laid about, indicate interrupted experiments\r\nin optics. There are quadrant-glasses, compasses, scales, weights, and\r\nsundry boxes of mathematical instruments, once doubtless highly\r\nprized. In one place a model of the governor, in another of the\r\nparallel-motion, and in a little box, fitted with wooden cylinders\r\nmounted with paper and covered with figures, is what we suppose to be\r\na model of his calculating-machine. On the shelves are minerals and\r\nchemicals in pots and jars, on which the dust of nearly half a century\r\nhas settled. The moist substances have long since dried up; the putty\r\nhas been turned to stone, and the paste to dust. On one shelf we come\r\nupon a dish in which lies a withered bunch of grapes. On the floor, in\r\na corner, near to where Watt sat and worked, is a hair-trunk--a\r\ntouching memorial of a long-past love and a long-dead sorrow. It\r\ncontains all poor Gregory's school-books, his first attempts at\r\nwriting, his boy's drawings of battles, his first school-exercises\r\ndown to his college-themes, his delectuses, his grammars, his\r\ndictionaries, and his class-books--brought into this retired room,\r\nwhere the father's eye could rest upon them. Near at hand is the\r\nsculpture-machine, on which he continued working to the last. Its\r\nwooden frame is worm-eaten, and dropping into dust, like the hands\r\nthat made it. But though the great workman is gone to rest, with all\r\nhis griefs and cares, and his handiwork is fast crumbling to decay,\r\nthe spirit of his work, the thought which he put into his inventions,\r\nstill survives, and will probably continue to influence the destinies\r\nof his race for all time to come.\"\r\n\r\nThe visitor to Westminster Abbey will find neither monarch, nor\r\nwarrior, nor statesman, nor poet, honored with a nobler epitaph than\r\nthat which is inscribed on the pedestal of Chantrey's monument to\r\nWatt:\r\n\r\n                      NOT TO PERPETUATE A NAME,\r\n          WHICH MUST ENDURE WHILE THE PEACEFUL ARTS FLOURISH,\r\n                              BUT TO SHOW\r\n    THAT MANKIND HAVE LEARNT TO HONOR THOSE WHO BEST DESERVE THEIR\r\n                              GRATITUDE,\r\n                              THE KING,\r\n   HIS MINISTERS, AND MANY OF THE NOBLES AND COMMONERS OF THE REALM,\r\n                        RAISED THIS MONUMENT TO\r\n                              JAMES WATT,\r\n            WHO, DIRECTING THE FORCE OF AN ORIGINAL GENIUS,\r\n               EARLY EXERCISED IN PHILOSOPHIC RESEARCH,\r\n                         TO THE IMPROVEMENT OF\r\n                           THE STEAM-ENGINE,\r\n  ENLARGED THE RESOURCES OF HIS COUNTRY, INCREASED THE POWER OF MAN,\r\n                     AND ROSE TO AN EMINENT PLACE\r\n     AMONG THE MOST ILLUSTRIOUS FOLLOWERS OF SCIENCE AND THE REAL\r\n                       BENEFACTORS OF THE WORLD.\r\n\r\n                      BORN AT GREENOCK, MDCCXXXVI.\r\n\r\n            DIED AT HEATHFIELD, IN STAFFORDSHIRE, MDCCCXIX.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Tomb of James Watt.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--THE CONTEMPORARIES OF JAMES WATT.\r\n\r\nIn the chronology of the steam-engine, the contemporaries of Watt have\r\nbeen so completely overshadowed by the greater and more successful\r\ninventor, as to have been almost forgotten by the biographer and by\r\nthe student of history. Yet, among the engineers and engine-builders,\r\nas well as among the inventors of his day, Watt found many\r\nenterprising rivals and keen competitors. Some of these men, had they\r\nnot been so completely fettered by Watt's patents, would have probably\r\ndone work which would have entitled them to far higher honor than has\r\nbeen accorded them.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM MURDOCH was one of the men to whom Watt, no less than the\r\nworld, was greatly indebted. For many years he was the assistant,\r\nfriend, and coadjutor of Watt; and it is to his ingenuity that we are\r\nto give credit for not only many independent inventions, but also for\r\nthe suggestions and improvements which were often indispensable to the\r\nformation and perfection of some of Watt's own inventions.\r\n\r\nMurdoch was employed by Boulton & Watt in 1776, and was made\r\nsuperintendent of construction in the engine department, and given\r\ngeneral charge of the erection of engines. He was sent into Cornwall,\r\nand spent in that district much of the time during which he served the\r\nfirm, erecting pumping-engines, the construction of which for so many\r\nyears constituted a large part of the business of the Soho\r\nestablishment. He was looked upon by both Boulton and Watt as a\r\nsincere friend, as well as a loyal adherent, and from 1810 to 1830 was\r\ngiven a partner's share of the income of the firm, and a salary of\r\nL1,000. He retired from business at the last of the two dates named,\r\nand, dying in 1839, was buried near the two partners in Handsworth\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\nMurdoch made a model, in 1784, of the locomotive patented by Watt in\r\nthat year. He devised the arrangement of \"sun-and-planet wheels,\"\r\nadopted for a time in all of Watt's \"rotative\" engines, and invented\r\nthe oscillating steam-engine (Fig. 36) in 1785, using the \"D-slide\r\nvalves,\" _G_, moved by the gear, _E_, which was driven by an eccentric\r\non the shaft, without regard to the oscillation of the cylinder, _A_.\r\nHe was the inventor of a rotary engine and of many minor machines for\r\nspecial purposes, and of many machine-tools used at Soho in building\r\nengines and machines. He seems, like Watt, to have had special\r\nfondness for the worm-gear, and introduced it wherever it could\r\nproperly take the place of ordinary gearing. Some of the machines\r\ndesigned by Watt and Murdoch, who always worked well together, were\r\nfound still in use and in good working condition by the author when\r\nvisiting the works at Soho in 1873. The old mint in which, from 1797\r\nto 1805, Boulton had coined 4,000 tons of copper, had then been pulled\r\ndown, and a new mint had been erected in 1860. Many old machines\r\nstill remained about the establishment as souvenirs of the three great\r\nmechanics.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 36.--Murdoch's Oscillating Engine, 1785.]\r\n\r\nOutside of Soho, Murdoch also found ample employment for his inventive\r\ntalent. In 1792, while at Redruth, his residence before finally\r\nreturning to Soho, he was led to speculate upon the possibility of\r\nutilizing the illuminating qualities of coal-gas, and, convinced of\r\nits practicability, he laid the subject before the Royal Society in\r\n1808, and was awarded the Rumford gold medal. He had, ten years\r\nearlier, lighted a part of the Soho works with coal-gas, and in 1803\r\nWatt authorized him to extend his pipes throughout all the buildings.\r\nSeveral manufacturers promptly introduced the new light, and its use\r\nextended very rapidly.\r\n\r\nStill another of Murdoch's favorite schemes was the transmission of\r\npower by the use of compressed air. He drove the pattern-shop engine\r\nat Soho by means of air from the blowing-engine in the foundery, and\r\nerected a pneumatic lift to elevate castings from the foundery-floor\r\nto the canal-bank. He made a steam-gun, introduced the heating of\r\nbuildings by the circulation of hot water, and invented the method of\r\ntransmitting packages through tubes by the impulse of compressed air,\r\nas now practised by the \"pneumatic dispatch\" companies. He died at the\r\nage of eighty-five years.\r\n\r\nAmong the most active and formidable of Watt's business rivals was\r\nJONATHAN HORNBLOWER, the patentee of the \"compound\" or double-cylinder\r\nengine. A sketch of this engine, as patented by Hornblower in 1781, is\r\nhere given (Fig. 37). It was first described by the inventor in the\r\n\"Encyclopaedia Britannica.\" It consists, as is seen by reference to the\r\nengraving, of two steam-cylinders, _A_ and _B_--_A_ being the low and\r\n_B_ the high pressure cylinder--the steam leaving the latter being\r\nexhausted into the former, and, after doing its work there, passing\r\ninto the condenser, as already described. The piston-rods, _C_ and\r\n_D_, are both connected to the same part of the beam by chains, as in\r\nthe other early engines. These rods pass through stuffing-boxes in the\r\ncylinder-heads, which are fitted up like those seen on the Watt\r\nengine. Steam is led to the engine through the pipe, _G Y_, and cocks,\r\n_a_, _b_, _c_, and _d_, are adjustable, as required, to lead steam\r\ninto and from the cylinders, and are moved by the plug-rod, _W_, which\r\nactuates handles not shown. _K_ is the exhaust-pipe leading to the\r\ncondenser. _V_ is the engine feed-pump rod, and _X_ the great rod\r\ncarrying the pump-buckets at the bottom of the shaft.\r\n\r\nThe cocks _c_ and _a_ being open and _b_ and _d_ shut, the steam\r\npasses from the boiler into the upper part of the steam-cylinder, _B_;\r\nand the communication between the lower part of _B_ and the top of _A_\r\nis also open. Before starting, steam being shut off from the engine,\r\nthe great weight of the pump-rod, _X_, causes that end of the beam to\r\npreponderate, the pistons standing, as shown, at the top of their\r\nrespective steam-cylinders.\r\n\r\nThe engine being freed from all air by opening all the valves and\r\npermitting the steam to drive it through the engine and out of the\r\ncondenser through the \"snifting-valve,\" _O_, the valves _b_ and _d_\r\nare closed, and the cock in the exhaust-pipe opened.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 37.--Hornblower's Compound Engine, 1781.]\r\n\r\nThe steam beneath the piston of the large cylinder is immediately\r\ncondensed, and the pressure on the upper side of that piston causes it\r\nto descend, carrying that end of the beam with it, and raising the\r\nopposite end with the pump-rods and their attachments. At the same\r\ntime, the steam from the lower end of the small high-pressure cylinder\r\nbeing let into the upper end of the larger cylinder, the completion of\r\nthe stroke finds a cylinder full of steam transferred from the one to\r\nthe other with corresponding increase of volume and decrease of\r\npressure. While expanding and diminishing in pressure as it passes\r\nfrom the smaller into the larger cylinder, this charge of steam\r\ngradually resists less and less the pressure of the steam from the\r\nboiler on the upper side of the piston of the small cylinder, _B_, and\r\nthe net result is the movement of the engine by pressures exerted on\r\nthe upper sides of both pistons and against pressures of less\r\nintensity on the under sides of both. The pressures in the lower part\r\nof the small cylinder, in the upper part of the large cylinder, and in\r\nthe communicating passage, are evidently all equal at any given time.\r\n\r\nWhen the pistons have reached the bottoms of their respective\r\ncylinders, the valves at the top of the small cylinder, _B_, and at\r\nthe bottom of the large cylinder, _A_, are closed, and the valves _c_\r\nand _d_ are opened. Steam from the boiler now enters beneath the\r\npiston of the small cylinder; the steam in the larger cylinder is\r\nexhausted into the condenser, and the steam already in the small\r\ncylinder passes over into the large cylinder, following up the piston\r\nas it rises.\r\n\r\nThus, at each stroke a small cylinder full of steam is taken from the\r\nboiler, and the same weight, occupying the volume of the larger\r\ncylinder, is exhausted into the condenser from the latter cylinder.\r\n\r\nReferring to the method of operation of this engine, Prof. Robison\r\ndemonstrated that the effect produced was the same as in Watt's\r\nsingle-cylinder engine--a fact which is comprehended in the law\r\nenunciated many years later by Rankine, that, \"so far as the\r\ntheoretical action of the steam on the piston is concerned, it is\r\nimmaterial whether the expansion takes place in one cylinder, or in\r\ntwo or more cylinders.\" It was found, in practice, that the Hornblower\r\nengine was no more economical than the Watt engine; and that erected\r\nat the Tin Croft Mine, Cornwall, in 1792, did even less work with the\r\nsame fuel than the Watt engines.\r\n\r\nHornblower was prosecuted by Boulton & Watt for infringement. The suit\r\nwas decided against him, and he was imprisoned in default of payment\r\nof the royalty, and fine demanded. He died a disappointed and\r\nimpoverished man. The plan thus unsuccessfully introduced by\r\nHornblower was subsequently modified and adopted by others among the\r\ncontemporaries of Watt; and, with higher steam and the use of the Watt\r\ncondenser, the \"compound\" gradually became a standard type of\r\nsteam-engine.\r\n\r\nArthur Woolf, in 1804, re-introduced the Hornblower or Falck engine,\r\nwith its two steam-cylinders, using steam of higher tension. His first\r\nengine was built for a brewery in London, and a considerable number\r\nwere subsequently made. Woolf expanded his steam from six to nine\r\ntimes, and the pumping-engines built from his plans were said to have\r\nraised about 40,000,000 pounds one foot high per bushel of coals, when\r\nthe Watt engine was raising but little more than 30,000,000. In one\r\ncase, a duty of 57,000,000 was claimed.\r\n\r\nThe most successful of those competitors of Watt who endeavored to\r\ndevise a peculiar form of pumping-engine, which should have the\r\nefficiency of that of Boulton & Watt, and the necessary advantage in\r\nfirst cost, were WILLIAM BULL and RICHARD TREVITHICK.[42] The\r\naccompanying illustration shows the design, which was then known as\r\nthe \"Bull Cornish Engine.\"\r\n\r\n  [42] For an exceedingly interesting and very faithful account of\r\n  their work, _see_ \"Life of Richard Trevithick,\" by F. Trevithick,\r\n  London, 1872.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--Bull's Pumping-Engine, 1798.]\r\n\r\nThe steam-cylinder, _a_, is carried on wooden beams, _b_, extending\r\nacross the engine-house directly over the pump-well. The piston-rod,\r\n_c_, is secured to the pump-rods, _d d_, the cylinder being inverted,\r\nand the pumps, _e_, in the shaft, _f_, are thus operated without the\r\nintervention of the beam invariably seen in Watt's engines. A\r\nconnecting-rod, _g_, attached to the pump-rod and to the end of a\r\nbalance-beam, _h_, operates the latter, and is counterbalanced by a\r\nweight, _i_. The rod, _j_, serves both as a plug-rod and as an\r\nair-pump connecting-rod. A snifting-valve, _k_, opens when the engine\r\nis blown through, and relieves the condenser and air-pump, _l_, of all\r\nair. The rod, _m_, operates a solid air-pump piston, the valves of the\r\npump being placed on either side at the base, instead of in the\r\npump-bucket, as in Watt's engines. The condensing-water cistern was a\r\nwooden tank, _n_. A jet \"pipe-condenser,\" _o_, was used instead of a\r\njet condenser of the form adopted by other makers, and was supplied\r\nwith water through the cock, _p_. The plug-rod, _q_, as it rises and\r\nfalls with the pump-rods and balance-beam, operates the\r\n\"gear-handles,\" _r r_, and opens and closes the valves, _s s_, at the\r\nrequired points in the stroke. The attendant works these valves by\r\nhand, in starting, from the floor, _t_. The operation of the engine is\r\nsimilar to that of a Watt engine. It is still in use, with a few\r\nmodifications and improvements, and is a very economical and durable\r\nmachine. It has not been as generally adopted, however, as it would\r\nprobably have been had not the legal proscription of Watt's patents so\r\nseriously interfered with its introduction. Its simplicity and\r\nlightness are decided advantages, and its designers are entitled to\r\ngreat credit for their boldness and ingenuity, as displayed in their\r\napplication of the minor devices which distinguish the engine. The\r\ndesign is probably to be credited to Bull originally; but Trevithick\r\nbuilt some of these engines, and is supposed to have greatly improved\r\nthem while working with Edward Bull, the son of the inventor, William\r\nBull. One of these engines was erected by them at the Herland Mine,\r\nCornwall, in 1798, which had a steam-cylinder 60 inches in diameter,\r\nand was built on the plan just described.\r\n\r\nAnother of the contemporaries of James Watt was a clergyman, EDWARD\r\nCARTWRIGHT, the distinguished inventor of the power-loom, and of the\r\nfirst machine ever used in combing wool, who revived Watt's plan of\r\nsurface-condensation in a somewhat modified form. Watt had made a\r\n\"pipe-condenser,\" similar in plan to those now often used, but\r\nhad simply immersed it in a tank of water, instead of in a\r\nconstantly-flowing stream. Cartwright proposed to use two concentric\r\ncylinders or spheres, between which the steam entered when exhausted\r\nfrom the cylinder of the engine, and was condensed by contact with\r\nthe metal surfaces. Cold water within the smaller and surrounding the\r\nexterior vessel kept the metal cold, and absorbed the heat discharged\r\nby the condensing vapor.\r\n\r\nCartwright's engine is best described in the _Philosophical Magazine_\r\nof June, 1798, from which the accompanying sketch is copied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 39.--Cartwright's Engine, 1798.]\r\n\r\nThe object of the inventor is stated to have been to remedy the\r\ndefects of the Watt engine--imperfect vacuum, friction, and\r\ncomplication.\r\n\r\nIn the figure, the steam-cylinder takes steam through the pipe, _B_.\r\nThe piston, _R_, has a rod extending downward to the smaller\r\npump-piston, _G_, and upward to the cross-head, which, in turn, drives\r\nthe cranks above, by means of connecting-rods. The shafts thus turned\r\nare connected by a pair of gears, _M L_, of which one drives a pinion\r\non the shaft of the fly-wheel. _D_ is the exhaust-pipe leading to the\r\ncondenser, _F_; and the pump, _G_, removes the air and water of\r\ncondensation, forcing it into the hot-well, _H_, whence it is returned\r\nto the boiler through the pipe, _I_. A float in _H_ adjusts an\r\nair-valve, so as to keep a supply of air in the chamber, to serve as a\r\ncushion and to make an air-chamber of the reservoir, and permits the\r\nexcess to escape. The large tank contains the water supplied for\r\ncondensing the steam.\r\n\r\nThe piston, _R_, is made of metal, and is packed with two sets of cut\r\nmetal rings, forced out against the sides of the cylinder by steel\r\nsprings, the rings being cut at three points in the circumference, and\r\nkept in place by the springs. The arrangement of the two cranks, with\r\ntheir shafts and gears, is intended to supersede Watt's plan for\r\nsecuring a perfectly rectilinear movement of the head of the\r\npiston-rod, without friction.\r\n\r\nIn the accounts given of this engine, great stress is laid upon the\r\nsupposed important advantage here offered, by the introduction of the\r\nsurface-condenser, of permitting the employment of a working-fluid\r\nother than steam--as, for example, alcohol, which is too valuable to\r\nbe lost. It was proposed to use the engine in connection with a still,\r\nand thus to effect great economy by making the fuel do double duty.\r\nThe only part of the plan which proved both novel and valuable was the\r\nmetallic packing and piston, which has not yet been superseded. The\r\nengine itself never came into use.\r\n\r\nAt this point, the history of the steam-engine becomes the story of\r\nits applications in several different directions, the most important\r\nof which are the raising of water--which had hitherto been its only\r\napplication--the locomotive-engine, the driving of mill-machinery, and\r\nsteam-navigation.\r\n\r\nHere we take leave of James Watt and of his contemporaries, of the\r\nformer of whom a French author[43] says: \"The part which he played in\r\nthe mechanical applications of the power of steam can only be compared\r\nto that of Newton in astronomy and of Shakespeare in poetry.\" Since\r\nthe time of Watt, improvements have been made principally in matters\r\nof mere detail, and in the extension of the range of application of\r\nthe steam-engine.\r\n\r\n  [43] Bataille. \"Traite des Machines a Vapeur,\" Paris, 1847.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER IV.\r\n\r\n_THE MODERN STEAM-ENGINE._\r\n\r\n  \"Those projects which abridge distance have done most for the\r\n  civilization and happiness of our species.\"--MACAULAY.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PERIOD OF APPLICATION--1800-'40.\r\n\r\nSTEAM-LOCOMOTION ON RAILROADS.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 40.--The First Railroad-Car, 1825.]\r\n\r\nIntroductory.--The commencement of the nineteenth century found the\r\nmodern steam-engine fully developed in all its principal features, and\r\nfairly at work in many departments of industry. The genius of\r\nWorcester, and Morland, and Savery, and Desaguliers, had, in the first\r\nperiod of the application of the power of steam to useful work,\r\neffected a beginning which, looked upon from a point of view which\r\nexhibits its importance as the first step toward the wonderful results\r\nto-day familiar to every one, appears in its true light, and entitles\r\nthose great men to even greater honor than has been accorded them. The\r\nresults actually accomplished, however, were absolutely insignificant\r\nin comparison with those which marked the period of development just\r\ndescribed. Yet even the work of Watt and of his contemporaries was but\r\na mere prelude to the marvellous advances made in the succeeding\r\nperiod, to which we are now come, and, in extent and importance, was\r\ninsignificant in comparison with that accomplished by their successors\r\nin the development of all mechanical industries by the application of\r\nthe steam-engine to the movement of every kind of machine.\r\n\r\nThe first of the two periods of application saw the steam-engine\r\nadapted simply to the elevation of water and the drainage of mines;\r\nduring the second period it was adapted to every variety of useful\r\nwork, and introduced wherever the muscular strength of men and\r\nanimals, or the power of wind and of falling water, which had\r\npreviously been the only motors, had found application. A history of\r\nthe development of industries by the introduction of steam-power\r\nduring this period, would be no less extended and hardly less\r\ninteresting than that of the steam-engine itself.\r\n\r\nThe way had been fairly opened by Boulton and Watt; and the year 1800\r\nsaw a crowd of engineers and manufacturers entering upon it, eager to\r\nreap the harvest of distinction and of pecuniary returns which seemed\r\nso promising to all. The last year of the eighteenth century was also\r\nthe last of the twenty-five years of partnership of Boulton & Watt,\r\nand, with it, the patents under which that firm had held the great\r\nmonopoly of steam-engine building expired. The right to manufacture\r\nthe modern steam-engine was common to all. Watt had, at the\r\ncommencement of the new century, retired from active business-life.\r\nBoulton remained in business; but he was not the inventor of the new\r\nengine, and could not retain, by the exercise of all his remaining\r\npower, the privileges previously held by legal authorization.\r\n\r\nThe young Boulton and the young Watt were not the Boulton & Watt of\r\nearlier years; and, had they possessed all of the business talent and\r\nall of the inventive genius of their fathers, they could not have\r\nretained control of a business which was now growing far more rapidly\r\nthan the facilities for manufacturing could be extended in any single\r\nestablishment. All over the country, and even on the Continent of\r\nEurope, and in America, thousands of mechanics, and many men of\r\nmechanical tastes in other professions, were familiar with the\r\nprinciples of the new machine, and were speculating upon its value for\r\nall the purposes to which it has since been applied; and a multitude\r\nof enthusiastic mechanics, and a larger multitude of visionary and\r\nignorant schemers, were experimenting with every imaginable device, in\r\nthe vain hope of attaining perpetual motion, and other hardly less\r\nabsurd results, by its modification and improvement. Steam-engine\r\nbuilding establishments sprang up wherever a mechanic had succeeded in\r\nerecting a workshop and in acquiring a local reputation as a worker in\r\nmetal, and many of Watt's workmen went out from Soho to take charge of\r\nthe work done in these shops. Nearly all of the great establishments\r\nwhich are to-day most noted for their extent and for the importance\r\nand magnitude of the work done in them, not only in Great Britain, but\r\nin Europe and the United States, came into existence during this\r\nsecond period of the application of the steam-engine as a prime mover.\r\n\r\nThe new establishments usually grew out of older shops of a less\r\npretentious character, and were managed by men who had been trained by\r\nWatt, or who had had a still more awakening experience with those who\r\nvainly strove to make up, by their ingenuity and by great excellence\r\nof workmanship, the advantages possessed at Soho in a legal monopoly\r\nand greater experience in the business.\r\n\r\nIt was exceedingly difficult to find expert and conscientious workmen,\r\nand machine-tools had not become as thoroughly perfected as had the\r\nsteam-engine itself. These difficulties were gradually overcome,\r\nhowever, and thenceforward the growth of the business was increasingly\r\nrapid.\r\n\r\nEvery important form of engine had now been invented. Watt had\r\nperfected, with the aid of Murdoch, both the pumping-engine and the\r\nrotative steam-engine for application to mills. He had invented the\r\ntrunk engine, and Murdoch had devised the oscillating engine and the\r\nordinary slide-valve, and had made a model locomotive-engine, while\r\nHornblower had introduced the compound engine. The application of\r\nsteam to navigation had been often proposed, and had sometimes been\r\nattempted, with sufficient success to indicate to the intelligent\r\nobserver an ultimate triumph. It only remained to extend the use of\r\nsteam as a motor into all known departments of industry, and to effect\r\nsuch improvements in details as experience should prove desirable.\r\n\r\nThe engines of Hero, of Porta, and of Branca were, it will be\r\nremembered, non-condensing; but the first plan of a non-condensing\r\nengine that could be made of any really practical use is given in the\r\n\"Theatrum Machinarum\" of Leupold, published in 1720. This sketch is\r\ncopied in Fig. 41. It is stated by Leupold that this plan was\r\nsuggested by Papin. It consists of two single-acting cylinders, _r s_,\r\nreceiving steam alternately from the same steam-pipe through a\r\n\"four-way cock,\" _x_, and exhausting into the atmosphere. Steam is\r\nfurnished by the boiler, _a_, and the pistons, _c d_, are alternately\r\nraised and depressed, depressing and raising the pump-rods, _k l_, to\r\nwhich they are attached by the beams, _h g_, vibrating on the centres,\r\n_i i_. The water from the pumps, _o p_, is forced up the stand-pipe,\r\n_q_, and discharged at its top. The alternate action of the\r\nsteam-pistons is secured by turning the \"four-way cock,\" _x_, first\r\ninto the position shown, and then, at the completion of the stroke,\r\ninto the reverse position, by which change the steam from the boiler\r\nis then led into the cylinder, _s_, and the steam in _r_ is discharged\r\ninto the atmosphere.[44]\r\n\r\n  [44] _Vide_ \"Theatrum Machinarum,\" vol. iii., Tab. 30.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 41.--Leupold's Engine, 1720.]\r\n\r\nLeupold states that he is indebted to Papin for the suggestion of the\r\npeculiar valve here used. He also proposed to use a Savery engine\r\nwithout condensation in raising water. We have no evidence that this\r\nengine was ever built.\r\n\r\nThe first rude scheme for applying steam to locomotion on land was\r\nprobably that of Isaac Newton, who, in 1680, proposed the machine\r\nshown in the accompanying figure (42), which will be recognized as\r\nrepresenting the scientific toy which is found in nearly every\r\ncollection of illustrative philosophical apparatus. As described in\r\nthe \"Explanation of the Newtonian Philosophy,\" it consists of a\r\nspherical boiler, _B_, mounted on a carriage. Steam issuing from the\r\npipe, _C_, seen pointing directly backward, by its reaction upon the\r\ncarriage, drives the latter ahead. The driver, sitting at _A_,\r\ncontrols the steam by the handle, _E_, and cock, _F_. The fire is seen\r\nat _D_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 42.--Newton's Steam-Carriage, 1680.]\r\n\r\nWhen, at the end of the eighteenth century, the steam-engine had been\r\nso far perfected that the possibility of its successful application to\r\nlocomotion had become fully and very generally recognized, the problem\r\nof adapting it to locomotion on land was attacked by many inventors.\r\n\r\nDr. Robison had, as far back as in 1759, proposed it to James Watt\r\nduring one of their conferences, at a time when the latter was even\r\nmore ignorant than the former of the principles which were involved in\r\nthe construction of the steam-engine, and this suggestion may have had\r\nsome influence in determining Watt to pursue his research; thus\r\nsetting in operation that train of thoughtful investigation and\r\nexperiment which finally earned for him his splendid fame.\r\n\r\nIn 1765, that singular genius, Dr. Erasmus Darwin, whose celebrity was\r\nacquired by speculations in poetry and philosophy as well as in\r\nmedicine, urged Matthew Boulton--subsequently Watt's partner, and just\r\nthen corresponding with our own Franklin in relation to the use of\r\nsteam-power--to construct a steam-carriage, or \"fiery chariot,\" as he\r\npoetically styled it, and of which he sketched a set of plans. A young\r\nman named Edgeworth became interested in the scheme, and, in 1768,\r\npublished a paper which had secured for him a gold medal from the\r\nSociety of Arts. In this paper he proposed railroads on which the\r\ncarriages were to be drawn by horses, _or by ropes from steam-winding\r\nengines_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 43.--Read's Steam-Carriage, 1790.]\r\n\r\nNathan Read, of whom an account will be given hereafter, when\r\ndescribing his attempt to introduce steam-navigation, planned, and in\r\n1790 obtained a patent for, a steam-carriage, of which the sketch seen\r\nin Fig. 43 is copied from the rough drawing accompanying his\r\napplication. In the figure, _A A A A_ are the wheels; _B B_, pinions\r\non the hubs of the rear wheels, which are driven by a ratchet\r\narrangement on the racks, _G G_, connected with the piston-rods; _C o_\r\nis the boiler; _D D_, the steam-pipes carrying steam to the\r\nsteam-cylinder, _E E_; _F F_ are the engine-frames; _H_ is the\r\n\"tongue\" or \"pole\" of the carriage, and is turned by a horizontal\r\nsteering-wheel, with which it is connected by the ropes or chains, _I\r\nK_, _I K_; _W W_ are the cocks, which serve to shut off steam from the\r\nengine when necessary, and to determine the amount of steam to be\r\nadmitted. The pipes _a a_ are exhaust-pipes, which the inventor\r\nproposed to turn so that they should point backward, in order to\r\nsecure the advantage of the effort of reaction of the expelled steam.\r\n(!)\r\n\r\nRead made a model steam-carriage, which he exhibited when endeavoring\r\nto secure assistance in furtherance of his schemes, but seems to have\r\ngiven more attention to steam-navigation, and nothing was ever\r\naccomplished by him in this direction.\r\n\r\nThese were merely promising schemes, however. The first actual\r\nexperiment was made, as is supposed, by a French army-officer,\r\nNICHOLAS JOSEPH CUGNOT, who in 1769 built a steam-carriage, which was\r\nset at work in presence of the French Minister of War, the Duke de\r\nChoiseul. The funds required by him were furnished by the Compte de\r\nSaxe. Encouraged by the partial success of the first locomotive, he,\r\nin 1770, constructed a second (Fig. 44), which is still preserved in\r\nthe Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers, Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 44.--Cugnot's Steam-Carriage, 1770.]\r\n\r\nThis machine, when recently examined by the author, was still in an\r\nexcellent state of preservation. The carriage and its machinery are\r\nsubstantially built and well-finished, and exceedingly creditable\r\npieces of work in every respect. It surprises the engineer to find\r\nsuch evidence of the high character of the work of the mechanic\r\nBrezin a century ago. The steam-cylinders were 13 inches in diameter,\r\nand the engine was evidently of considerable power. This locomotive\r\nwas intended for the transportation of artillery. It consists of two\r\nbeams of heavy timber extending from end to end, supported by two\r\nstrong wheels behind, and one still heavier but smaller wheel in\r\nfront. The latter carries on its rim blocks which cut into the soil as\r\nthe wheel turns, and thus give greater holding power. The single wheel\r\nis turned by two single-acting engines, one on each side, supplied\r\nwith steam by a boiler (seen in the sketch) suspended in front of the\r\nmachine. The connection between the engines and the wheels was\r\neffected by means of pawls, as first proposed by Papin, which could be\r\nreversed when it was desired to drive the machine backward. A seat is\r\nmounted on the carriage-body for the driver, who steers the machine by\r\na train of gearing, which turns the whole frame, carrying the\r\nmachinery 15 or 20 degrees either way. This locomotive was found to\r\nhave been built on a tolerably satisfactory general plan; but the\r\nboiler was too small, and the steering apparatus was incapable of\r\nhandling the carriage with promptness.\r\n\r\nThe death of one of Cugnot's patrons, and the exile of the other, put\r\nan end to Cugnot's experiments.\r\n\r\nCugnot was a mechanic by choice, and exhibited great talent. He was a\r\nnative of Vaud, in Lorraine, where he was born in 1725. He served both\r\nin the French and the German armies. While under the Marechal de Saxe,\r\nhe constructed his first steam locomotive-engine, which only\r\ndisappointed him, as he stated, in consequence of the inefficiency of\r\nthe feed-pumps. The second was that built under the authority of the\r\nMinister Choiseul, and cost 20,000 livres. Cugnot received from the\r\nFrench Government a pension of 600 livres. He died in 1804, at the age\r\nof seventy-nine years.\r\n\r\nWatt, at a very early period, proposed to apply his own engine to\r\nlocomotion, and contemplated using either a non-condensing engine or\r\nan air-surface condenser. He actually included the locomotive-engine\r\nin his patent of 1784; and his assistant, Murdoch, in the same year,\r\nmade a working-model locomotive (Fig. 45), which was capable of\r\nrunning at a rapid rate. This model, now deposited in the Patent\r\nMuseum at South Kensington, London, had a flue-boiler, and its\r\nsteam-cylinder was three-fourths of an inch in diameter, and the\r\nstroke of piston 2 inches. The driving-wheels were 9-1/2 inches\r\ndiameter.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 45.--Murdoch's Model, 1784.]\r\n\r\nNothing was, however, done on a larger scale by either Watt or\r\nMurdoch, who both found more than enough to claim their attention in\r\nthe construction and introduction of other engines. Murdoch's model is\r\nsaid to have run from 6 to 8 miles an hour, its little driving-wheels\r\nmaking from 200 to 275 revolutions per minute. As is seen in the\r\nsketch, this model was fitted with the same form of engine, known as\r\nthe \"grasshopper-engine,\" which was used in the United States by\r\nOliver Evans.\r\n\r\n\"To Oliver Evans,\" says Dr. Ernest Alban, the distinguished German\r\nengineer, \"was it reserved to show the true value of a long-known\r\nprinciple, and to establish thereon a new and more simple method of\r\napplying the power of steam--a method that will remain an eternal\r\nmemorial to its introducer.\" Dr. Alban here refers to the earliest\r\npermanently successful introduction of the non-condensing\r\nhigh-pressure steam-engine.\r\n\r\nOLIVER EVANS, one of the most ingenious mechanics that America has\r\never produced, was born at Newport, Del., in 1755 or 1756, the son of\r\npeople in very humble circumstances.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Oliver Evans.]\r\n\r\nHe was, in his youth, apprenticed to a wheelwright, and soon exhibited\r\ngreat mechanical talent and a strong desire to acquire knowledge. His\r\nattention was, at an early period, drawn to the possible application\r\nof the power of steam to useful purposes by the boyish pranks of one\r\nof his comrades, who, placing a small quantity of water in a\r\ngun-barrel, and ramming down a tight wad, put the barrel in the fire\r\nof a blacksmith's forge. The loud report which accompanied the\r\nexpulsion of the wad was an evidence to young Evans of great and (as\r\nhe supposed) previously undiscovered power.\r\n\r\nSubsequently meeting with a description of a Newcomen engine, he at\r\nonce noticed that the elastic force of confined steam was not there\r\nutilized. He then designed the non-condensing engine, in which the\r\npower was derived exclusively from the tension of high-pressure steam,\r\nand proposed its application to the propulsion of carriages.\r\n\r\nAbout the year 1780, Evans joined his brothers, who were millers by\r\noccupation, and at once employed his inventive talent in improving the\r\ndetails of mill-work, and with such success as to reduce the cost of\r\nattendance one-half, and also to increase the fineness of the flour\r\nmade. He proved himself a very expert millwright.\r\n\r\nIn 1786 he applied to the Pennsylvania Legislature for a patent for\r\nthe application of the steam-engine to driving mills, and to the\r\nsteam-carriage, but was refused it. In 1800 or 1801, Evans, after\r\nconsultation with Professor Robert Patterson, of the University of\r\nPennsylvania, and getting his approval of the plans, commenced the\r\nconstruction of a steam-carriage to be driven by a non-condensing\r\nengine. He soon concluded, however, that it would be a better scheme,\r\npecuniarily, to adapt his engine, which was novel in form and of small\r\nfirst cost, to driving mills; and he accordingly changed his plans,\r\nand built an engine of 6 inches diameter of cylinder and 18 inches\r\nstroke of piston, which he applied with perfect success to driving a\r\nplaster-mill.\r\n\r\nThis engine, which he called the \"Columbian Engine,\" was of a peculiar\r\nform, as seen in Fig. 46. The beam is supported at one end by a\r\nrocking column; at the other, it is attached directly to the\r\npiston-rod, while the crank lies beneath the beam, the connecting-rod,\r\n1, being attached to the latter at the extreme end. The head of the\r\npiston-rod is compelled to rise and fall in a vertical line by the\r\n\"Evans's parallelogram\"--a kind of parallel-motion very similar to\r\none of those designed by Watt. In the sketch (Fig. 46), 2 is the\r\ncrank, 3 the valve-motion, 4 the steam-pipe from the boiler, _E_, 5 6\r\n7 the feed-pipe leading from the pump, _F_. _A_ is the boiler. The\r\nflame from the fire on the grate, _H_, passes under the boiler between\r\nbrick walls, and back through a central flue to the chimney, _I_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 46.--Evans's Non-condensing Engine, 1800.]\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Evans continued to extend the applications of his engine\r\nand to perfect its details; and, others following in his track, the\r\nnon-condensing engine is to-day fulfilling the predictions which he\r\nmade 70 years ago, when he said:\r\n\r\n\"I have no doubt that my engines will propel boats against the current\r\nof the Mississippi, and wagons on turnpike roads, with great\r\nprofit....\"\r\n\r\n\"The time will come when people will travel in stages moved by\r\nsteam-engines from one city to another, almost as fast as birds can\r\nfly, 15 or 20 miles an hour.... A carriage will start from Washington\r\nin the morning, the passengers will breakfast at Baltimore, dine at\r\nPhiladelphia, and sup in New York the same day....\r\n\r\n\"Engines will drive boats 10 or 12 miles an hour, and there will be\r\nhundreds of steamers running on the Mississippi, as predicted years\r\nago.\"[45]\r\n\r\n  [45] Evans's prediction is less remarkable than that of Darwin,\r\n  elsewhere quoted.\r\n\r\nIn 1804, Evans applied one of his engines in the transportation of a\r\nlarge flat-bottomed craft, built on an order of the Board of Health of\r\nPhiladelphia, for use in clearing some of the docks along the\r\nwater-front of the city. Mounting it on wheels, he placed in it one of\r\nhis 5-horse power engines, and named the odd machine (Fig. 47)\r\n\"Oruktor Amphibolis.\" This steam dredging-machine, weighing about\r\n40,000 pounds, was then propelled very slowly from the works, up\r\nMarket Street, around to the Water-Works, and then launched into the\r\nSchuylkill. The engine was then applied to the paddle-wheel at the\r\nstern, and drove the craft down the river to its confluence with the\r\nDelaware.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 47.--Evans's \"Oruktor Amphibolis,\" 1804.]\r\n\r\nIn September of the same year, Evans laid before the Lancaster\r\nTurnpike Company a statement of the estimated expenses and profits of\r\nsteam-transportation on the common road, assuming the size of the\r\ncarriage used to be sufficient for transporting 100 barrels of flour\r\n50 miles in 24 hours, and placed in competition with 10 wagons drawn\r\nby 5 horses each.\r\n\r\nIn the sketch above given of the \"Oruktor Amphibolis,\" the engine is\r\nseen to resemble that previously described. The wheel, _A_, is driven\r\nby a rod depending from the end of a beam, _B' B_, the other end of\r\nwhich is supported at _E_ by the frame, _E F G_. The body of the\r\nmachine is carried on wheels, _K K_, driven by belts, _M M_, from the\r\npulley on the shaft carrying _A_. The paddle-wheel is seen at _W_.\r\nEvans had some time previously sent Joseph Sampson to England with\r\ncopies of his plans, and by him they were shown to Trevithick, Vivian,\r\nand other British engineers.\r\n\r\nAmong other devices, the now familiar Cornish boiler, having a single\r\ninternal flue, and the Lancashire boiler, having a pair of internal\r\nflues, were planned and used by Evans.\r\n\r\nAt about the time that he was engaged on his steam dredging-machine,\r\nEvans communicated with Messrs. McKeever & Valcourt, who contracted\r\nwith him to build an engine for a steam-vessel to ply between New\r\nOrleans and Natchez on the Mississippi, the hull of the vessel to be\r\nbuilt on the river, and the machinery to be sent to the first-named\r\ncity to be set up in the boat. Financial difficulties and low water\r\ncombined to prevent the completion of the steamer, and the engine was\r\nset at work driving a saw-mill, where, until the mill was destroyed by\r\nfire, it sawed lumber at the rate of 250 feet of boards per hour.\r\n\r\nEvans never succeeded in accomplishing in America as great a success\r\nas had rewarded Watt in Great Britain; but he continued to build\r\nsteam-engines to the end of his life, April 19, 1819, and was\r\nsucceeded by his sons-in-law, James Rush and David Muhlenberg.\r\n\r\nHe exhibited equal intelligence and ingenuity in perfecting the\r\nprocesses of milling, and in effecting improvements in his own\r\nbusiness, that of the millwright. When but twenty-four years old, he\r\ninvented a machine for making the wire teeth used in cotton and\r\nwoolen cards, turning them out at the rate of 3,000 per minute. A\r\nlittle later he invented a card-setting machine, which cut the wire\r\nfrom the reel, bent the teeth, and inserted them. In milling, he\r\ninvented a whole series of machines and attachments, including the\r\nelevator, the \"conveyor,\" the \"hopper-box,\" the \"drill,\" and the\r\n\"descender,\" and enabled the miller to make finer flour, gaining over\r\n20 pounds to the barrel, and to do this at half the former cost of\r\nattendance. The introduction of his improvements into Ellicott's\r\nmills, near Baltimore, where 325 barrels of flour were made per day,\r\nwas calculated to have saved nearly $5,000 per year in cost of labor,\r\nand over $30,000 by increasing the production. He wrote \"The Young\r\nSteam-Engineer's Guide,\" and a work which remained standard many years\r\nafter his death, \"The Young Millwright's Guide.\" Less fortunate than\r\nhis transatlantic rival, he was nevertheless equally deserving of\r\nfame. He has sometimes been called \"The Watt of America.\"\r\n\r\nThe application of steam to locomotion on the common road was much\r\nmore successful in Great Britain than in the United States. As early\r\nas 1786, William Symmington, subsequently more successful in his\r\nefforts to introduce steam for marine propulsion, assisted by his\r\nfather, made a working model of a steam-carriage, which did not,\r\nhowever, lead to important results.\r\n\r\nIn 1802, Richard Trevithick, a pupil of Murdoch's, who afterward\r\nbecame well known in connection with the introduction of railroads,\r\nmade a model steam-carriage, which was patented in the same year. The\r\nmodel may still be seen in the Patent Museum at South Kensington.[46]\r\n\r\n  [46] _See_ \"Life of Trevithick.\"\r\n\r\nIn this engine, high-pressure steam was employed, and the condenser\r\nwas dispensed with. The boiler was of the form devised by Evans, and\r\nwas subsequently generally used in Cornwall, where it was called the\r\n\"Trevithick Boiler.\" The engine had but one cylinder, and the\r\npiston-rod drove a \"cross-tail,\" working in guides, which was\r\nconnected with a \"cross-head\" on the opposite side of the shaft by two\r\n\"side-rods.\" The connecting-rod was attached to the cross-head and the\r\ncrank, \"returning\" toward the cylinder as the shaft lay between the\r\nlatter and the cross-head. This was probably the first example of the\r\nnow common \"return connecting-rod engine.\" The connection between the\r\ncrank-shaft and the wheels of the carriage was effected by gearing.\r\nThe valve-gear and the feed-pumps were worked from the engine-shaft.\r\nThe inventor proposed to secure his wheels against slipping by\r\nprojecting bolts, when necessary, through the rim of the wheel into\r\nthe ground. The first carriage of full size was built by Trevithick\r\nand Vivian at Camborne, in 1803, and, after trial, was taken to\r\nLondon, where it was exhibited to the public. _En route_, it was\r\ndriven by its own engines to Plymouth, 90 miles from Camborne, and\r\nthen shipped by water. It is not known whether the inventor lost faith\r\nin his invention; but he very soon dismantled the machine, sold the\r\nengine and carriage separately, and returned to Cornwall, where he\r\nsoon began work on a railroad-locomotive.\r\n\r\nIn 1821, Julius Griffiths, of Brompton, Middlesex, England, patented a\r\nsteam-carriage for the transportation of passengers on the highway.\r\nHis first road-locomotive was built in the same year by Joseph Bramah,\r\none of the ablest mechanics of his time. The frame of the carriage\r\ncarried a large double coach-body between the two axles, and the\r\nmachinery was mounted over and behind the rear axle. One man was\r\nstationed on a rear platform, to manage the engine and to attend to\r\nthe fire, and another, stationed in front of the body of the coach,\r\nhandled the steering-wheel. The boiler was composed of horizontal\r\nwater-tubes and steam-tubes, the latter being so situated as to\r\nreceive heat from the furnace-gases _en route_ to the chimney, and\r\nthus to act as a superheater. The wheels were driven, by means of\r\nintermediate gearing, by two steam-engines, which, with their\r\nattachments, were suspended on helical springs, to prevent injury by\r\njars and shocks. An air-surface condenser was used, consisting of\r\nflattened thin metal tubes, cooled by the contact of the external air,\r\nand discharging the water of condensation, as it accumulated within\r\nthem, into a feed-pump, which, in turn, forced it into the lowest row\r\nof tubes in the boiler.\r\n\r\nThe boiler did not prove large enough for continuous work; but the\r\ncarriage was used experimentally, now and then, for a number of years.\r\n\r\nDuring the succeeding ten years the adaptation of the steam-engine to\r\nland-transportation continued to attract more and more attention, and\r\nexperimental road-engines were built with steadily-increasing\r\nfrequency. The defects of these engines revealing themselves on trial,\r\nthey were one by one remedied, and the road-locomotive gradually\r\nassumed a shape which was mechanically satisfactory. Their final\r\nintroduction into general use seemed at one time only a matter of\r\ntime; their non-success was due to causes over which the legislator\r\nand the general public, and not the engineer, had control, as well as\r\nto the development of steam-transportation on a rival plan.\r\n\r\nIn 1822, David Gordon patented a road-engine, but it is not known\r\nwhether it was ever built. At about the same time, Mr. Goldsworthy\r\nGurney, who subsequently took an active part in their introduction,\r\nstated, in his lectures, that \"elementary power is capable of being\r\napplied to propel carriages along common roads with great political\r\nadvantage, and the floating knowledge of the day places the object\r\nwithin reach.\" He made an ammonia-engine--probably the first ever\r\nmade--and worked it so successfully, that he made use of it in driving\r\na little locomotive.\r\n\r\nTwo years later, Gordon patented a curious arrangement, which,\r\nhowever, had been proposed twelve years earlier by Brunton, and was\r\nagain proposed afterward by Gurney, and others. This consisted in\r\nfitting to the engine a set of jointed legs, imitating, as nearly as\r\nthe inventor could make them, the action of a horse's legs and feet.\r\nSuch an arrangement was actually experimented with until it was found\r\nthat they could not be made to work satisfactorily, when it was also\r\nfound that they were not needed.\r\n\r\nDuring the same season, Burstall & Hill made a steam-carriage, and\r\nmade many unsuccessful attempts to introduce their plan. The engine\r\nused was like that of Evans, except that the steam-cylinder was placed\r\nat the end of the beam, and the crank-shaft under the middle. The\r\nfront and rear wheels were connected by a longitudinal shaft and bevel\r\ngearing. The boiler was found to have the usual defect, and would only\r\nsupply steam for a speed of three or four miles an hour. The result\r\nwas a costly failure. W. H. James, of London, in 1824-'25, proposed\r\nseveral devices for placing the working parts, as well as the body of\r\nthe carriage, on springs, without interfering with their operation,\r\nand the Messrs. Seaward patented similar devices. Samuel Brown, in\r\n1826, introduced a gas-engine, in which the piston was driven by the\r\npressure produced by the combustion of gas, and a vacuum was secured\r\nby the condensation of the resulting vapor. Brown built a locomotive\r\nwhich he propelled by this engine. He ascended Shooter's Hill, near\r\nLondon, and the principal cause of his ultimate failure seems to have\r\nbeen the cost of operating the engine.\r\n\r\nFrom this date forward, during several years, a number of inventors\r\nand mechanics seem to have devoted their whole time to this promising\r\nscheme. Among them, Burstall & Hill, Gurney, Ogle & Summers, Sir\r\nCharles Dance, and Walter Hancock, were most successful.\r\n\r\nGurney, in the year 1827, built a steam-carriage, which he kept at\r\nwork nearly two years in and about London, and sometimes making long\r\njourneys. On one occasion he made the journey from Meksham to Cranford\r\nBridge, a distance of 85 miles, in 10 hours, including all stops. He\r\nused the mechanical legs previously adopted by Brunton and by Gordon,\r\nbut omitted this rude device in those engines subsequently built.\r\n\r\nGurney's engine of 1828 is of interest to the engineer as exhibiting a\r\nvery excellent arrangement of machinery, and as having one of the\r\nearliest of \"sectional boilers.\" The latter was of peculiar form, and\r\ndiffered greatly in design from the sectional boiler invented a\r\nquarter of a century earlier by John Stevens, in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 48.--Gurney's Steam-Carriage.]\r\n\r\nIn the sketch (Fig. 48) this boiler is seen at the right. It was\r\ncomposed of bent [<]-shaped tubes, _a a_, connected to two cylinders,\r\n_b b_, the upper one of which was a steam-chamber. Vertical tubes\r\nconnected these two chambers, and permitted a complete and regular\r\ncirculation of the water. A separate reservoir, called a separator,\r\n_d_, was connected with these chambers by pipes, as shown. From the\r\ntop of this separator a steam-pipe, _e e e_, conveyed steam to the\r\nengine-cylinders at _f_. The cranks, _g_, on the rear axle were turned\r\nby the engines, and the eccentric, _h_, on the axle drove the\r\nvalve-gearing and the valve, _i_. The link, _k l_, being moved by a\r\nline, _l l_, led from the driver's seat, the carriage was started,\r\nstopped, or reversed, by throwing the upper end of the link into gear\r\nwith the valve-stem, by setting the link midway between its upper and\r\nlower positions, or by raising it until the lower end, coming into\r\naction on the valve-stem, produced a reverse motion of the valve. The\r\npin on which this link vibrated is seen at the centre of its\r\nelliptical strap. The throttle-valve, _o_, by which the supply of\r\nsteam to the engine was adjusted, was worked by the lever, _n_. The\r\nexhaust-pipe, _p_, led to the tank, _q_, and the uncondensed vapor\r\npassed to the chimney, _s s_, by the pipe, _r r_. The force-pump, _u_,\r\ntaking feed-water from the tank, _t_, supplied it to the boiler by the\r\npipe, _x x x_, which, _en route_, was coiled up to form a \"heater\"\r\ndirectly above the boiler. The supply was regulated by the cock, _y_.\r\nThe attendant had a seat at _z_. A blast-apparatus, 1, was driven by\r\nan independent engine, 2 3, and produced a forced blast, which was led\r\nto the boiler-furnace through the air-duct, 5 5; 4 4 represents the\r\nsteam-pipe to the little blowing-engine. The steering-wheel, 6, was\r\ndirected by a lever, 7, and the change of direction of the perch, 8,\r\nwhich turned about a king-bolt at 9, gave the desired direction to the\r\nforward wheels and to the carriage.\r\n\r\nThis seems to have been one of the best designs brought out at that\r\ntime. The boiler, built to carry 70 pounds, was safe and strong, and\r\nwas tested up to 800 pounds pressure. A forced draught was provided.\r\nThe engines were well placed, and of good design. The valve was\r\narranged to work the steam with expansion from half-stroke. The\r\nfeed-water was heated, and the steam slightly superheated. The boiler\r\nhere used has been since reproduced under new names by later\r\ninventors, and is still used with satisfactory results. Modifications\r\nof the \"pipe-boiler\" were made by several other makers of\r\nsteam-carriages also. Anderson & James made their boilers of\r\nlap-welded iron tubes of one inch internal diameter and one-fifth inch\r\nthick, and claimed for them perfect safety. Such tubes should have\r\nsufficient strength to sustain a pressure of 20,000 pounds per square\r\ninch. If made of such good iron as the makers claimed to have put into\r\nthem, \"which worked like lead,\" they would, as was also claimed, when\r\nruptured, open by tearing, and discharge their contents without\r\nproducing the usual disastrous consequences of boiler explosions.\r\n\r\nThe primary principle of the sectional boiler was then well\r\nunderstood. The boilers of Ogle & Summers were made up of pairs of\r\nupright tubes, set one within the other, the intervening space being\r\nfilled with water and steam, and the flame passing through the inner\r\nand around the outer tube of each pair.\r\n\r\nOne of the engines of Sir James Anderson and W. H. James was built in\r\n1829. It had two 3-1/2-inch steam-cylinders, driving the rear wheels\r\nindependently. In James's earlier plan of 1824-'25, a pair of\r\ncylinders was attached to each of the two halves into which the rear\r\naxle was divided, and were arranged to drive cranks set at\r\nright-angles with each other. The later machine weighed 3 tons, and\r\ncarried 15 passengers, on a rough graveled road across the Epping\r\nForest, at the rate of from 12 to 15 miles per hour. Steam was carried\r\nat 300 pounds. Several tubes gave way in the welds, but the carriage\r\nreturned, carrying 24 passengers at the rate of 7 miles per hour. On a\r\nlater trial, with new boilers, the carriage again made 15 miles per\r\nhour. It was, however, subject to frequent accidents, and was finally\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\nWALTER HANCOCK was the most successful and persevering of all those\r\nwho attempted the introduction of steam on the common road. He had, in\r\n1827, patented a boiler of such peculiar form, that it deserves\r\ndescription. It consisted of a collection of flat chambers, of which\r\nthe walls were of boiler-plate. These chambers were arranged side by\r\nside, and connected laterally by tubes and stays, and all were\r\nconnected by short vertical tubes to a horizontal large pipe placed\r\nacross the top of the boiler-casing, and serving as a steam-drum or\r\nseparator. This earliest of \"sheet flue-boilers\" did excellent\r\nservice on Hancock's steam-carriages, where experience showed that\r\nthere was little or no danger of disruptive explosions.\r\n\r\nHancock's first steam-carriage was mounted on three wheels, the\r\nleading-wheel arranged to swivel on a king-bolt, and driven by a pair\r\nof oscillating cylinders connected with its axle, which was \"cranked\"\r\nfor the purpose. The engines turned with the steering-wheel. This\r\ncarriage was by no means satisfactory, but it was used for a long\r\ntime, and traveled many hundreds of miles without once failing to do\r\nthe work assigned it.\r\n\r\nBy this time there were a half-dozen steam-carriages under\r\nconstruction for Hancock, for Ogle & Summers, and for Sir Charles\r\nDance.\r\n\r\nIn 1831, Hancock placed a new carriage on a route between London and\r\nStratford, where it ran regularly for hire. Dance, in the same season,\r\nstarted another on the line between Cheltenham and Gloucester, where\r\nit ran from February 21st to June 22d, traveling 3,500 miles and\r\ncarrying 3,000 passengers, running the 9 miles in 55 minutes usually,\r\nand sometimes in three-quarters of an hour, and never meeting with an\r\naccident, except the breakage of an axle in running over heaps of\r\nstones which had been purposely placed on the road by enemies of the\r\nnew system of transportation. Ogle & Summers's carriage attained a\r\nspeed, as testified by Ogle before a committee of the House of\r\nCommons, of from 32 to 35 miles an hour, and on a rising grade, near\r\nSouthampton, at 24-1/2 miles per hour. They carried 250 pounds of\r\nsteam, ran 800 miles, and met with no accident. Colonel Macerone, in\r\n1833, ran a steam-carriage of his own design from London to Windsor\r\nand back, with 11 passengers, a distance of 23-1/2 miles, in 2 hours.\r\nSir Charles Dance, in the same year, ran his carriage 16 miles an\r\nhour, and made long excursions at the rate of 9 miles an hour. Still\r\nanother experimenter, Heaton, ascended Lickey Hill, between Worcester\r\nand Birmingham, on gradients of one in eight and one in nine, in\r\nplaces; this was considered one of the worst pieces of road in\r\nEngland. The carriage towed a coach containing 20 passengers.\r\n\r\nOf all these, and many others, Hancock, however, had most marked\r\nsuccess. His coach, called the \"Infant,\" which was set at work in\r\nFebruary, 1831, was, a year later, plying between London \"City\" and\r\nPaddington. Another, called the \"Era,\" was built for the London and\r\nGreenwich Steam-Carriage Company, which was mechanically a success.\r\nThe company, however, was financially unsuccessful. In October, 1832,\r\nthe \"Infant\" ran to Brighton from London, carrying a party of 11, at\r\nthe rate of 9 miles per hour, ascending Redhill at a speed of 5 miles.\r\nThey steamed 38 miles the first day, stopping at night at Hazledean,\r\nand reached Brighton next day, running 11 miles per hour. Returning\r\nwith 15 passengers, the coach ran 1 mile in less than 4 minutes, and\r\nmade 10 miles in 55 minutes. A run from Stratford to Brighton was made\r\nin less than 10 hours, at an average speed of 12 miles an hour running\r\ntime, the actual running time being less than 6 hours. The next year\r\nanother carriage, the \"Enterprise,\" was put on the road to Paddington\r\nby Hancock for another company, and ran regularly over two weeks; but\r\nthis company was also unsuccessful. In the summer of 1833 he brought\r\nout still another steam-coach, the \"Autopsy\" (Fig. 49), which he ran\r\nto Brighton, and then, returning to London, man[oe]uvred the carriage\r\nin the crowded streets without difficulty or accident. He went about\r\nthe streets of London at all times, and without hesitation. The coach\r\nnext ran between Finsbury Square and Pentonville regularly for four\r\nweeks, without accident or delay. In the sketch, a part of the side is\r\nbroken away to show the machinery. The boiler, _A B_, supplies steam\r\nthrough the steam-pipe, _H K_, to the steam-engine, _C D_, which is\r\ncoupled to the crank-shaft, _F_. _E_ is the feed-pump. The rear axle\r\nis turned by the endless chain seen connecting it with the\r\nengine-shaft, and the rear wheels, _S_, are thus driven. A blower,\r\n_T_, gives a forced draught. The driver sits at _M_, steering by the\r\nwheel, _N_, which is coupled to the larger wheel, _P_, and thus turns\r\nthe forward axle into any desired position. In 1834, Hancock built a\r\nsteam \"drag\" on an Austrian order, which, carrying 10 persons and\r\ntowing a coach containing 6 passengers, was driven through the city\r\nbeyond Islington, making 14 miles an hour on a level, and 8 miles or\r\nmore on rising ground. In the same year he built the \"Era,\" and, in\r\nAugust, put the \"Autopsy\" on with it, to make a steam-line to\r\nPaddington. These coaches ran until the end of November, carrying\r\n4,000 passengers, at a usual rate of speed of 12 miles per hour. He\r\nthen sent the \"Era\" to Dublin, where, on one occasion, it ran 18 miles\r\nper hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 49.--Hancock's \"Autopsy,\" 1833.]\r\n\r\nIn 1835 a large carriage, the \"Erin,\" was completed, which was\r\nintended to carry 20 passengers. It towed three omnibuses and a\r\nstage-coach, with 50 passengers, on a level road, at the speed of 10\r\nmiles an hour. It drew an omnibus with 18 passengers through\r\nWhitehall, Charing Cross, and Regent Street, and out to Brentford,\r\nrunning 14 miles an hour. It ran also to Reading, making 38 miles,\r\nwith the same load, in 3 hours and 8 minutes running time. The stops\r\n_en route_ occupied a half-hour. The same carriage made 75 miles to\r\nMarlborough in 7-1/2 hours running time, stopping 4-1/2 hours on the\r\nroad, in consequence of having left the tender and supplies behind.\r\n\r\nIn May, 1836, Hancock put all his carriages on the Paddington road,\r\nand ran regularly for over five months, running 4,200 miles in 525\r\ntrips to Islington, 143 to Paddington, and 44 to Stratford, passing\r\nthrough the city over 200 times. The carriages averaged 5 hours and 17\r\nor 18 minutes daily running time. A light steam-phaeton, built in\r\n1838, for his own use, made 20 miles an hour, and was driven about the\r\ncity, and among horses and carriages, without causing annoyance or\r\ndanger. Its usual speed was about 10 miles an hour. Altogether,\r\nHancock built nine steam-carriages, capable of carrying 116 passengers\r\nin addition to the regular attendants.[47]\r\n\r\n  [47] For a detailed account of the progress of steam on the highway,\r\n  _see_ \"Steam on Common Roads,\" etc., by Young, Holley, & Fisher,\r\n  London, 1861.\r\n\r\nIn December, 1833, about 20 steam-carriages and traction road-engines\r\nwere running, or were in course of construction, in and near London.\r\nIn our own country, the roughness of roads discouraged inventors;\r\nand in Great Britain even, the successful introduction of\r\nroad-locomotives, which seemed at one time almost an accomplished\r\nfact, finally met with so many obstacles, that even Hancock, the most\r\ningenious, persistent, and successful constructor, gave up in despair.\r\nHostile legislation procured by opposing interests, and the rapid\r\nprogress of steam-locomotion on railroads, caused this result.\r\n\r\nIn consequence of this interruption of experiment, almost nothing was\r\ndone during the succeeding quarter of a century, and it is only within\r\na few years that anything like a business success has been founded\r\nupon the construction of road-locomotives, although the scheme seems\r\nto have been at no time entirely given up.\r\n\r\nThe opposition of coach-proprietors, and of all classes having an\r\ninterest in the old lines of coaches, was most determined, and the\r\nfeeling evinced by them was intensely bitter; but the advocates of the\r\nnew system of transportation were equally determined and persevering,\r\nand, having right on their side, and the pecuniary advantage of the\r\npublic as their object, they would probably have succeeded ultimately,\r\nexcept for the introduction of the still better method of\r\ntransportation by rail.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1831, when the war between the two parties was at its\r\nheight, a committee of the British House of Commons made a very\r\ncomplete investigation of the subject. This committee reported that\r\nthey had become convinced that \"the substitution of inanimate for\r\nanimal power, in draught on common roads, is one of the most important\r\nimprovements in the means of internal communication ever introduced.\"\r\nThey considered its practicability to have been \"fully established,\"\r\nand predicted that its introduction would \"take place more or less\r\nrapidly, in proportion as the attention of scientific men shall be\r\ndrawn, by public encouragement, to further improvement.\" The success\r\nof the system had, as they stated, been retarded by prejudice, adverse\r\ninterests, and prohibitory tolls; and the committee remark: \"When we\r\nconsider that these trials have been made under the most unfavorable\r\ncircumstances, at great expense, in total uncertainty, without any of\r\nthose guides which experience has given to other branches of\r\nengineering; that those engaged in making them are persons looking\r\nsolely to their own interests, and not theorists attempting the\r\nperfection of ingenious models; when we find them convinced, after\r\nlong experience, that they are introducing such a mode of conveyance\r\nas shall tempt the public, by its superior advantages, from the use of\r\nthe admirable lines of coaches which have been generally established,\r\nit surely cannot be contended that the introduction of steam-carriages\r\non common roads is, as yet, an uncertain experiment, unworthy of\r\nlegislative attention.\"\r\n\r\nFarey, one of the most distinguished mechanical engineers of the\r\ntime, testified that he considered the practicability of such a system\r\nas fully established, and that the result would be its general\r\nadoption. Gurney had run his carriage between 20 and 30 miles an hour;\r\nHancock could sustain a speed of 10 miles; Ogle had run his coach 32\r\nto 35 miles an hour, and ascended a hill rising 1 in 6 at the speed of\r\n24-1/2 miles. Summers had traveled up a hill having a gradient of 1 in\r\n12, with 19 passengers, at the rate of speed of 15 miles per hour; he\r\nhad run 4-1/2 hours at 30 miles an hour. Farey thought that\r\nsteam-coaches would be found to cost one-third as much as the\r\nstage-coaches in use. The steam-carriages were reported to be safer\r\nthan those drawn by horses, and far more manageable; and the\r\nconstruction of boilers adopted--the \"sectional\" boiler, as it is now\r\ncalled--completely insured against injury by explosion, and the\r\ndangers and inconveniences arising from the frightening of horses had\r\nproved to be largely imaginary. The wear and tear of roads were found\r\nto be less than with horses, while with broad wheel-tires the\r\ncarriages acted beneficially as road-rollers. The committee finally\r\nconcluded:\r\n\r\n\"1. That carriages can be propelled by steam on common roads at an\r\naverage rate of 10 miles per hour.\r\n\r\n\"2. That at this rate they have conveyed upward of 14 passengers.\r\n\r\n\"3. That their weight, including engine, fuel, water, and attendants,\r\nmay be under three tons.\r\n\r\n\"4. That they can ascend and descend hills of considerable inclination\r\nwith facility and safety.\r\n\r\n\"5. That they are perfectly safe for passengers.\r\n\r\n\"6. That they are not (or need not be, if properly constructed)\r\nnuisances to the public.\r\n\r\n\"7. That they will become a speedier and cheaper mode of conveyance\r\nthan carriages drawn by horses.\r\n\r\n\"8. That, as they admit of greater breadth of tire than other\r\ncarriages, and as the roads are not acted on so injuriously as by the\r\nfeet of horses in common draught, such carriages will cause less wear\r\nof roads than coaches drawn by horses.\r\n\r\n\"9. That rates of toll have been imposed on steam-carriages, which\r\nwould prohibit their being used on several lines of road, were such\r\ncharges permitted to remain unaltered.\"\r\n\r\nTHE RAILROAD, which now, by the adaptation of steam to the propulsion\r\nof its carriages, became the successful rival of the system of\r\ntransportation of which an account has just been given, was not a new\r\ndevice. It, like all other important changes of method and great\r\ninventions, had been growing into form for ages. The ancients were\r\naccustomed to lay down blocks of stone as a way upon which their\r\nheavily-loaded wagons could be drawn with less resistance than on the\r\ncommon road. This practice was gradually so modified as to result in\r\nthe adoption of the now universally-practised methods of paving and\r\nroad-making. The old tracks, bearing the marks of heavy traffic, are\r\nstill seen in the streets of the unearthed city of Pompeii.\r\n\r\nIn the early days of mining in Great Britain, the coal or the ore was\r\ncarried from the mine to the vessel in which it was to be embarked in\r\nsacks on the backs of horses. Later, the miners laid out wagon-roads,\r\nand used carts and wagons drawn by horses, and the roads were paved\r\nwith stone along the lines traversed by the wheels of the vehicles.\r\nStill later (about 1630), heavy planks or squared timber took the\r\nplace of the stone, and were introduced into the north of England by a\r\ngentleman of the name of Beaumont, who had transferred his property\r\nthere from the south. A half century later, the system had become\r\ngenerally introduced. By the end of the eighteenth century the\r\nconstruction of these \"tram-ways\" had become well-understood, and the\r\neconomy which justified the expenditure of considerable amounts of\r\nmoney in making cuts and in filling, to bring the road to a uniform\r\ngrade, had become well-recognized. Arthur Young, writing at this time,\r\nsays the coal wagon-roads were \"great works, carried over all sorts\r\nof inequalities of ground, so far as the distance of nine or ten\r\nmiles,\" and that, on these tram-ways of timber, \"one horse is able to\r\ndraw, and that with ease, fifty or sixty bushels of coals.\" The\r\nwagon-wheels were of cast-iron, and made with grooved rims, which\r\nfitted the rounded tops of the wooden rails. But these wooden rails\r\nwere found subject to rapid decay, and at Whitehaven, in 1738, they\r\nwere protected from wear by cast-iron plates laid upon them, and this\r\nimprovement rapidly became known and adopted. A tram-road, laid down\r\nat Sheffield for the Duke of Norfolk, in 1776, was made by laying\r\nangle-bars of cast-iron on longitudinal sleepers of timber; another,\r\nbuilt by William Jessup in Leicestershire, in 1789, had an edge-rail,\r\nand the wheels were made with flanges, like those used to-day. The\r\nconed \"tread\" of the wheel, which prevents wear of flanges and reduces\r\nresistance, was the invention of James Wright, of Columbia, Pa., 40\r\nyears later. The modern railroad was simply the result of this gradual\r\nimprovement of the permanent way, and the adaptation of the\r\nsteam-engine to the propulsion of its wagons.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the nineteenth century, therefore, the\r\nsteam-engine had been given a form which permitted its use, and the\r\nrailroad had been so far perfected that there were no difficulties to\r\nbe anticipated in the construction of the permanent way, and inventors\r\nwere gradually preparing, as has been seen, to combine these two\r\nprincipal elements into one system. Railroads had been introduced in\r\nall parts of Great Britain, some of them of considerable length, and\r\ninvolving the interests of so many private individuals that they were\r\nnecessarily constructed under the authorization of legal enactments.\r\nIn the year 1805 the Merstham Railway was opened to traffic, and it is\r\nstated that on that occasion one horse drew a train of 12 wagons,\r\ncarrying 38 tons of stone, on a \"down gradient\" of 1 in 120, at the\r\nrate of 6 miles per hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Richard Trevithick.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 50.--Trevithick's Locomotive, 1804.]\r\n\r\nRICHARD TREVITHICK was the first engineer to apply steam-power to the\r\nhaulage of loads on the railroad. Trevithick was a Cornishman by\r\nbirth, a native of Redruth. He was naturally a skillful mechanic, and\r\nwas placed by his father with Watt's assistant, Murdoch, who was\r\nsuperintending the erection of pumping-engines in Cornwall; and from\r\nthat ingenious and accomplished engineer young Trevithick probably\r\nacquired both the skill and the knowledge which, with his native\r\ntalent, enterprise, and industry, enabled him to accomplish the work\r\nwhich has made him famous. He was soon intrusted with the erection and\r\nmanagement of large pumping-engines, and subsequently went into the\r\nbusiness of constructing steam-engines with another engineer, Edward\r\nBull, who took an active part, with the Hornblowers and others, in\r\nopposing the Boulton & Watt patents. The termination of the suits\r\nwhich established the validity of Watt's patent put an end to their\r\nbusiness, and Trevithick looked about for other work, and, not long\r\nafter, entered into partnership with a relative, Andrew Vivian, who\r\nwas also a skillful mechanic; they together designed and patented the\r\nsteam-carriage already referred to. Its success was sufficiently\r\nsatisfactory to awaken strong confidence of a perfect success on the\r\nnow common tram-roads; and Trevithick, in February, 1804, had\r\ncompleted a \"locomotive\" engine to work on the Welsh Pen-y-darran\r\nroad. This engine (Fig. 50) had a cylindrical flue-boiler, _A_, like\r\nthat designed by Oliver Evans, and a single steam-cylinder, _B_, set\r\nvertically into the steam-space of the boiler, and driving the\r\noutside cranks, _L_, on the rear axle of the engine by very long\r\nconnecting-rods, _D_, attached to its cross-head at _E_. The\r\nguide-bars, _I_, were stayed by braces leading to the opposite end of\r\nthe boiler. No attempt was made to condense the exhaust-steam, which\r\nwas discharged into the smoke-pipe. The pressure of steam adopted was\r\n40 pounds per square inch; but Trevithick had already made a number of\r\nnon-condensing engines on which he carried from 50 to 145 pounds\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1808, Trevithick built a railroad in London, on what was\r\nknown later as Torrington Square, or Euston Square, and set at work a\r\nsteam-carriage, which he called \"Catch-me-who-can.\" This was a very\r\nplain and simple machine. The steam-cylinder was set vertically in the\r\nafter-end of the boiler, and the cross-head was connected to two rods,\r\none on either side, driving the hind pair of wheels. The exhaust-steam\r\nentered the chimney, aiding the draught. This engine, weighing about\r\n10 tons, made from 12 to 15 miles an hour on the circular railway in\r\nLondon, and was said by its builder to be capable of making 20 miles\r\nan hour. The engine was finally thrown from the track, after some\r\nweeks of work, by the breaking of a rail, and, Trevithick's funds\r\nhaving been expended, it was never replaced. This engine had a\r\nsteam-cylinder 14-1/2 inches in diameter, and a stroke of piston of 4\r\nfeet. Trevithick used no device to aid the friction of the wheels on\r\nthe rails in giving pulling-power, and seems to have understood that\r\nnone was needed. This plan of working a locomotive-engine without such\r\ncomplications as had been proposed by other engineers was, however,\r\nsubsequently patented, in 1813, by Blackett & Hedley. The latter was\r\nat one time Trevithick's agent, and was director of Wylam Colliery, of\r\nwhich Mr. Blackett was proprietor.\r\n\r\nTrevithick applied his high-pressure non-conducting engine not only to\r\nlocomotives, but to every purpose that opportunity offered him. He put\r\none into the Tredegar Iron-Works, to drive the puddle-train, in 1801.\r\nThis engine had a steam-cylinder 28 inches in diameter, and 6 feet\r\nstroke of piston; a boiler of cast-iron, 6-3/4 feet in diameter and 20\r\nfeet long, with a wrought-iron internal tube, 3 feet in diameter at\r\nthe furnace-end and 24 inches beyond the furnace. The steam-pressure\r\nranged from 50 to 100 pounds per square inch. The valve was a four-way\r\ncock. The exhaust-steam was carried into the chimney, passing through\r\na feed-water heater _en route_. This engine was taken down in\r\n1856.[48]\r\n\r\n  [48] \"Life of Trevithick.\"\r\n\r\nIn 1803, Trevithick applied his engine to driving rock-drills, and\r\nthree years later made a large contract with the Trinity Board for\r\ndredging in the Thames, and constructed steam dredging-machines for\r\nthe work, of the form which is still most generally used in Great\r\nBritain, although rarely seen in the United States--the\r\n\"chain-and-bucket dredger.\"\r\n\r\nA little later, Trevithick was engaged upon the first and unsuccessful\r\nattempt to carry a tunnel under the Thames, at London; but no sooner\r\nhad that costly scheme been given up, than he returned to his favorite\r\npursuits, and continued his work on interrupted schemes for\r\nship-propulsion. Trevithick at last left England, spent some years in\r\nSouth America, and finally returned home and died in extreme poverty,\r\nApril, 1833, at the age of sixty-two, without having succeeded in\r\naccomplishing the general introduction of any of his inventions.\r\n\r\nTrevithick was characteristically an inventor of the typical sort. He\r\ninvented many valuable devices, but brought but few into even\r\nexperimental use, and reaped little advantage from any of them. He was\r\ningenious, a thorough mechanic, bold, active, and indefatigable; but\r\nhis lack of persistence made his whole life, as Smiles has said, \"but\r\na series of beginnings.\"\r\n\r\nIt is at about this period that we find evidence of the intelligent\r\nlabors of another of our own countrymen--one who, in consequence of\r\nthe unobtrusive manner in which his work was done, has never received\r\nthe full credit to which he is entitled.\r\n\r\nCOLONEL JOHN STEVENS, of Hoboken, as he is generally called, was born\r\nin the city of New York, in 1749; but throughout his business-life he\r\nwas a resident of New Jersey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Colonel John Stevens.]\r\n\r\nHis attention is said to have been first called to the application of\r\nsteam-power by seeing the experiments of John Fitch with his steamer\r\non the Delaware, and he at once devoted himself to the introduction of\r\nsteam-navigation with characteristic energy, and with a success that\r\nwill be indicated when we come to the consideration of that subject.\r\n\r\nBut this far-sighted engineer and statesman saw plainly the\r\nimportance of applying the steam-engine to land-transportation as well\r\nas to navigation; and not only that, but he saw with equal\r\ndistinctness the importance of a well-devised and carefully-prosecuted\r\nscheme of internal communication by a complete system of railroads. In\r\n1812 he published a pamphlet containing \"Documents tending to prove\r\nthe superior advantages of Railways and Steam-Carriages over\r\nCanal-Navigation.\"[49] At this time, the only locomotive in the world\r\nwas that of Trevithick and Vivian, at Merthyr Tydvil, and the railroad\r\nitself had not grown beyond the old wooden tram-roads of the\r\ncollieries. Yet Colonel Stevens says, in this paper: \"I can see\r\nnothing to hinder a steam-carriage moving on its ways with a velocity\r\nof 100 miles an hour;\" adding, in a foot-note: \"This astonishing\r\nvelocity is considered here merely possible. It is probable that it\r\nmay not, in practise, be convenient to exceed 20 or 30 miles per hour.\r\nActual experiment can only determine this matter, and I should not be\r\nsurprised at seeing steam-carriages propelled at the rate of 40 or 50\r\nmiles an hour.\"\r\n\r\n  [49] Printed by T. & J. Swords, 160 Pearl Street, New York, 1812.\r\n\r\nAt a yet earlier date he had addressed a memoir to the proper\r\nauthorities, urging his plans for railroads. He proposed rails of\r\ntimber, protected, when necessary, by iron plates, or to be made\r\nwholly of iron; the car-wheels were to be of cast-iron, with inside\r\nflanges to keep them on the track. The steam-engine was to be driven\r\nby steam of 50 pounds pressure and upward, and to be non-condensing.\r\n\r\nAnswering the objections of Robert R. Livingston and of the State\r\nCommissioners of New York, he goes further into details. He gives 500\r\nto 1,000 pounds as the maximum weight to be placed on each wheel;\r\nshows that the trains, or \"suits of carriages,\" as he calls them, will\r\nmake their journeys with as much certainty and celerity in the darkest\r\nnight as in the light of day; shows that the grades of proposed roads\r\nwould offer but little resistance; and places the whole subject before\r\nthe public with such accuracy of statement and such evident\r\nappreciation of its true value, that every one who reads this\r\nremarkable document will agree fully with President Charles King, who\r\nsaid[50] that \"whosoever shall attentively read this pamphlet, will\r\nperceive that the political, financial, commercial, and military\r\naspects of this great question were all present to Colonel Stevens's\r\nmind, and that he felt that he was fulfilling a patriotic duty when he\r\nplaced at the disposal of his native country these fruits of his\r\ngenius. The offering was not then accepted. The 'Thinker' was ahead of\r\nhis age; but it is grateful to know that he lived to see his projects\r\ncarried out, though not by the Government, and that, before he\r\nfinally, in 1838, closed his eyes in death, at the great age of\r\neighty-nine, he could justly feel assured that the name of Stevens, in\r\nhis own person and in that of his sons, was imperishably enrolled\r\namong those which a grateful country will cherish.\"\r\n\r\n  [50] \"Progress of the City of New York.\"\r\n\r\nWithout having made any one superlatively great improvement in the\r\nmechanism of the steam-engine, like that which gave Watt his\r\nfame--without having the honor even of being the first to\r\npropose the propulsion of vessels by the modern steam-engine, or\r\nsteam-transportation on land--he exhibited a far better knowledge of\r\nthe science and the art of engineering than any man of his time; and\r\nhe entertained and urged more advanced opinions and more statesmanlike\r\nviews in relation to the economical importance of the improvement and\r\nthe application of the steam-engine, both on land and water, than seem\r\nto be attributable to any other leading engineer of that time.\r\n\r\nSays Dr. King: \"Who can estimate if, at that day, acting upon the\r\nwell-considered suggestion of President Madison, 'of the signal\r\nadvantages to be derived to the United States from a general system of\r\ninternal communication and conveyance,' Congress had entertained\r\nColonel Stevens's proposal, and, after verifying by actual experiment\r\nupon a small scale the accuracy of his plan, had organized such a\r\n'general system of internal communication and conveyance;' who can\r\nbegin to estimate the inappreciable benefits that would have resulted\r\ntherefrom to the comfort, the wealth, the power, and, above all, to\r\nthe absolutely impregnable union of our great Republic and all its\r\ncomponent parts? All this Colonel Stevens embraced in his views, for\r\nhe was a statesman as well as an experimental philosopher; and whoever\r\nshall attentively read his pamphlet, will perceive that the political,\r\nfinancial, commercial, and military aspects of this great question\r\nwere all present to his mind, and he felt that he was fulfilling a\r\npatriotic duty when he placed at the disposal of his native country\r\nthese fruits of his genius.\"\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HEDLEY, who has already been referred to, seems to have been\r\nthe first to show, by carefully-conducted experiment, how far the\r\nadhesion of the wheels of the locomotive-engine could be relied upon\r\nfor hauling-power in the transportation of loads.\r\n\r\nHis employer, Blackett, had applied to Trevithick for a\r\nlocomotive-engine to haul coal-trains at the Wylam collieries; but\r\nTrevithick was unable, or was disinclined, to build him one, and in\r\nOctober, 1812, Hedley was authorized to attempt the construction of an\r\nengine. It was at about this time that Blenkinsop (1811) was trying\r\nthe toothed rail or rack, the Messrs. Chapman (December, 1812) were\r\nexperimenting with a towing-chain, and (May, 1813) Brunton with\r\nmovable legs.\r\n\r\nHedley, who had known of the success met with in the experiments of\r\nTrevithick with smooth wheels hauling loads of considerable weight, in\r\nCornwall, was confident that equal success might be expected in the\r\nnorth-country, and built a carriage to be moved by men stationed at\r\nfour handles, by which its wheels were turned.\r\n\r\nThis carriage was loaded with heavy masses of iron, and attached to\r\ntrains of coal-wagons on the railway. By repeated experiment, varying\r\nthe weight of the traction-carriage and the load hauled, Hedley\r\nascertained the proportion of the weight required for adhesion to that\r\nof the loads drawn. It was thus conclusively proven that the weight of\r\nhis proposed locomotive-engine would be sufficient to give the\r\npulling-power necessary for the propulsion of the coal-trains which it\r\nwas to haul.\r\n\r\nWhen the wheels slipped in consequence of the presence of grease,\r\nfrost, or moisture on the rail, Hedley proposed to sprinkle ashes on\r\nthe track, as sand is now distributed from the sand-box of the modern\r\nengine. This was in October, 1812.\r\n\r\nHedley now went to work building an engine with smooth wheels, and\r\npatented his design March 13, 1813, a month after he had put his\r\nengine at work. The locomotive had a cast-iron boiler, and a single\r\nsteam-cylinder 6 inches in diameter, with a small fly-wheel. This\r\nengine had too small a boiler, and he soon after built a larger\r\nengine, with a return-flue boiler made of wrought-iron. This hauled 8\r\nloaded coal-wagons 5 miles an hour at first, and a little later 10,\r\ndoing the work of 10 horses. The steam-pressure was carried at about\r\n50 pounds, and the exhaust, led into the chimney, where the pipe was\r\nturned upward, thus secured a blast of considerable intensity in its\r\nsmall chimney. Hedley also contracted the opening of the exhaust-pipe\r\nto intensify the blast, and was subjected to some annoyance by\r\nproprietors of lands along his railway, who were irritated by the\r\nburning of their grass and hedges, which were set on fire by the\r\nsparks thrown out of the chimney of the locomotive. The cost of\r\nHedley's experiment was defrayed by Mr. Blackett.\r\n\r\nSubsequently, Hedley mounted his engine on eight wheels, the\r\nfour-wheeled engines having been frequently stopped by breaking the\r\nlight rails then in use. Hedley's engines continued in use at the\r\nWylam collieries many years. The second engine was removed in 1862,\r\nand is now preserved at the South Kensington Museum, London.\r\n\r\nGEORGE STEPHENSON, to whom is generally accorded the honor of having\r\nfirst made the locomotive-engine a success, built his first engine at\r\nKillingworth, England, in 1814.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: George Stephenson.]\r\n\r\nAt this time Stephenson was by no means alone in the field, for the\r\nidea of applying the steam-engine to driving carriages on common roads\r\nand on railroads was beginning, as has been seen, to attract\r\nconsiderable attention. Stephenson, however, combined, in a very\r\nfortunate degree, the advantages of great natural inventive talent and\r\nan excellent mechanical training, reminding one strongly of James\r\nWatt. Indeed, Stephenson's portrait bears some resemblance to that of\r\nthe earlier great inventor.\r\n\r\nGeorge Stephenson was born June 9, 1781, at Wylam, near\r\nNewcastle-upon-Tyne, and was the son of a \"north-country miner.\" When\r\nstill a child, he exhibited great mechanical talent and unusual love\r\nof study. When set at work about the mines, his attention to duty and\r\nhis intelligence obtained for him rapid promotion, until, when but\r\nseventeen years of age, he was made engineer, and took charge of the\r\npumping-engine at which his father was fireman.\r\n\r\nWhen a mere child, and employed as a herd-boy, he amused himself\r\nmaking model engines in clay, and, as he grew older, never lost an\r\nopportunity to learn the construction and management of machinery.\r\nAfter having been employed at Newburn and Callerton, where he first\r\nbecame \"engine-man,\" he began to study with greater interest than ever\r\nthe various steam-engines which were then in use; and both the\r\nNewcomen engine and the Watt pumping-engine were soon thoroughly\r\nunderstood by him. After having become a brakeman, he removed to\r\nWillington Quay, where he married, and commenced his wedded life on 18\r\nor 20 shillings per week. It was here that he became an intimate\r\nfriend of the distinguished William Fairbairn, who was then working as\r\nan apprentice at the Percy Main Colliery, near by. The \"father of the\r\nrailroad\" and the future President of the British Association were\r\naccustomed, at times, to \"change works,\" and were frequently seen in\r\nconsultation over their numerous projects. It was at Willington Quay\r\nthat his son Robert, who afterward became a distinguished civil\r\nengineer, was born, October 16, 1803.\r\n\r\nIn the following year Stephenson removed to Killingworth, and became\r\nbrakeman at that colliery; but his wife soon died, and he gladly\r\naccepted an invitation to become engine-driver at a spinning-mill near\r\nMontrose, Scotland. At the end of a year he returned, on foot, to\r\nKillingworth with his savings (about L28), expended over one-half of\r\nthe amount in paying his father's debts and in making his parents\r\ncomfortable, and then returned to his old station as brakeman at the\r\npit.\r\n\r\nHere he made some useful improvements in the arrangement of the\r\nmachinery, and spent his spare hours in studying his engine and\r\nplanning new machines. He a little later distinguished himself by\r\naltering and repairing an old Newcomen engine at the High Pit, which\r\nhad failed to give satisfaction, making it thoroughly successful after\r\nthree days' work. The engine cleared the pit, at which it had been\r\nvainly laboring a long time, in two days after Stephenson started it\r\nup.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1812, Stephenson was made engine-wright of the\r\nKillingworth High Pit, receiving L100 a year, and it was made his duty\r\nto supervise the machinery of all the collieries under lease by the\r\nso-called \"Grand Allies.\" It was here, and at this period, that he\r\ncommenced a systematic course of self-improvement and the education of\r\nhis son, and here he first began to be recognized as an inventor. He\r\nwas full of life and something of a wag, and often made most amusing\r\napplications of his inventive powers: as when he placed the watch,\r\nwhich a comrade had brought him as out of repairs, in the oven \"to\r\ncook,\" his quick eye having noted the fact that the difficulty arose\r\nsimply from the clogging of the wheels by the oil, which had been\r\ncongealed by cold.\r\n\r\nSmiles,[51] his biographer, describes his cottage as a perfect\r\ncuriosity-shop, filled with models of engines, machines of various\r\nkinds, and novel apparatus. He connected the cradles of his neighbors'\r\nwives with the smoke-jacks in their chimneys, and thus relieved them\r\nfrom constant attendance upon their infants; he fished at night with a\r\nsubmarine lamp, which attracted the fish from all sides, and gave him\r\nwonderful luck; he also found time to give colloquial instruction to\r\nhis fellow-workmen.\r\n\r\n  [51] \"Lives of George and Robert Stephenson,\" by Samuel Smiles. New\r\n  York and London, 1868.\r\n\r\nHe built a self-acting inclined plane for his pit, on which the\r\nwagons, descending loaded, drew up the empty trains; and made so many\r\nimprovements at the Killingworth pit, that the number of horses\r\nemployed underground was reduced from 100 to 16.\r\n\r\nStephenson now had more liberty than when employed at the brakes, and,\r\nhearing of the experiments of Blackett and Hedley at Wylam, went over\r\nto their colliery to study their engine. He also went to Leeds to see\r\nthe Blenkinsop engine draw, at a trial, 70 tons at the rate of 3 miles\r\nan hour, and expressed his opinion in the characteristic remark, \"I\r\nthink I could make a better engine than that to go upon legs.\" He very\r\nsoon made the attempt.\r\n\r\nHaving laid the subject before the proprietors of the lease under\r\nwhich the collieries were worked, and convinced Lord Ravensworth, the\r\nprincipal owner, of the advantages to be secured by the use of a\r\n\"traveling engine,\" that nobleman advanced the money required.\r\nStephenson at once commenced his first locomotive-engine, building it\r\nin the workshops at West Moor, assisted mainly by John Thirlwall, the\r\ncolliery blacksmith, during the years 1813 and 1814, completing it in\r\nJuly of the latter year.\r\n\r\nThis engine had a wrought-iron boiler 8 feet long and 2 feet 10 inches\r\nin diameter, with a single flue 20 inches in diameter. The cylinders\r\nwere vertical, 8 inches in diameter and of 2 feet stroke of piston,\r\nset in the boiler, and driving a set of wheels which geared with each\r\nother and with other cogged wheels on the two driving-axles. A\r\nfeed-water heater surrounded the base of the chimney. This engine drew\r\n30 tons on a rising gradient of 10 or 12 feet to the mile at the rate\r\nof 4 miles an hour. This engine proved in many respects defective, and\r\nthe cost of its operation was found to be about as great as that of\r\nemploying horse-power.\r\n\r\nStephenson determined to build another engine on a somewhat different\r\nplan, and patented its design in February, 1815. It proved a much\r\nmore efficient machine than the \"Bluecher,\" the first engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 51.--Stephenson's Locomotive of 1815. Section.]\r\n\r\nThis second engine (Fig. 51) was also fitted with two vertical\r\ncylinders, _C c_, but the connecting-rods were attached directly to\r\nthe four driving-wheels, _W W'_. To permit the necessary freedom of\r\nmotion, \"ball-and-socket\" joints were adopted, to unite the rods with\r\nthe cross-heads, _R r_, and with the cranks, _R' Y'_; and the two\r\ndriving-axles were connected by an endless chain, _T t'_. The cranked\r\naxle and the outside connection of the wheels, as specified in the\r\npatent, were not used until afterward, it having been found impossible\r\nto get the cranked axles made. In this engine the forced draught\r\nobtained by the impulse of the exhaust-steam was adopted, doubling the\r\npower of the machine and permitting the use of coke as a fuel, and\r\nmaking it possible to adopt the multi-tubular boiler. Small\r\nsteam-cylinders, _S S S_, took the weight of the engine and served as\r\nsprings.\r\n\r\nIt was at about this time that George Stephenson and Sir Humphry\r\nDavy, independently and almost simultaneously, invented the\r\n\"safety-lamp,\" without which few mines of bituminous coal could to-day\r\nbe worked. The former used small tubes, the latter fine wire gauze, to\r\nintercept the flame. Stephenson proved the efficiency of his lamp by\r\ngoing with it directly into the inflammable atmosphere of a dangerous\r\nmine, and repeatedly permitting the light to be extinguished when the\r\nlamp became surcharged with the explosive mixture which had so\r\nfrequently proved fatal to the miners. This was in October and\r\nNovember, 1815, and Stephenson's work antedates that of the great\r\nphilosopher.[52] The controversy which arose between the supporters of\r\nthe rival claims of the two inventors was very earnest, and sometimes\r\nbitter. The friends of the young engineer raised a subscription,\r\namounting to above L1,000, and presented it to him as a token of their\r\nappreciation of the value of his simple yet important contrivance. Of\r\nthe two forms of lamp, that of Stephenson is claimed to be safest, the\r\nDavy lamp being liable to produce explosions by igniting the explosive\r\ngas when, by its combustion within the gauze cylinder, the latter is\r\nmade red-hot. Under similar conditions, the Stephenson lamp is simply\r\nextinguished, as was seen at Barnsley, in 1857, at the Oaks Colliery,\r\nwhere both kinds of lamp were in use, and elsewhere.\r\n\r\n  [52] _Vide_ \"A Description of the Safety-Lamp invented by George\r\n  Stephenson,\" etc., London, 1817.\r\n\r\nStephenson continued to study and experiment, with a view to the\r\nimprovement of his locomotive and the railroad. He introduced better\r\nmethods of track-laying and of jointing the rails, adopting a\r\nhalf-lap, or peculiar scarf-joint, in place of the then usual\r\nsquare-butt joint. He patented, with these modifications of the\r\npermanent way, several of his improvements of the engine. He had\r\nsubstituted forged for the rude cast wheels previously used,[53] and\r\nhad made many minor changes of detail. The engines built at this time\r\n(1816) continued in use many years. Two years later, with a\r\ndynamometer which he designed for the purpose, he made experimental\r\ndeterminations of the resistance of trains, and showed that it was\r\nmade up of several kinds, as the sliding friction of the axle-journals\r\nin their bearings, the rolling friction of the wheels on the rails,\r\nthe resistance due to gravity on gradients, and that due to the\r\nresistance of the air.\r\n\r\n  [53] The American chilled wheel of cast-iron, a better wheel than\r\n  that above described, has never been generally and successfully\r\n  introduced in Europe.\r\n\r\nThese experiments seemed to him conclusive against the possibility of\r\nthe competition of engines on the common highway with locomotives\r\nhauling trains on the rail. Finding that the resistance, with his\r\nrolling-stock, and at all the speeds at which he made his experiments,\r\nwas approximately invariable, and equivalent to about 10 pounds per\r\nton, and estimating that a gradient rising but 1 foot in 100 would\r\ndecrease the hauling power of the engine 50 per cent., he saw at once\r\nthe necessity of making all railroads as nearly absolutely level as\r\npossible, and, consequently, the radically distinctive character of\r\nthis branch of civil engineering work. He persistently condemned the\r\n\"folly\" of attempting the general introduction of steam on the common\r\nroad, where great changes of level and an impressible road-bed were\r\ncertain to prove fatal to success, and was most strenuous in his\r\nadvocacy of the policy of securing level tracks, even at very great\r\nexpense.\r\n\r\nTaking part in the contest, which now became a serious one, between\r\nthe advocates of steam on the common road and those urging the\r\nintroduction of locomotives and their trains on an iron track, he\r\ncalculated that a road-engine capable of carrying 20 or 30 passengers\r\nat 10 miles per hour, could, on the rail, carry ten times as many\r\npeople at three or four times that speed. The railway-engine finally\r\nsuperseded its predecessor--the engine of the common road--almost\r\ncompletely.\r\n\r\nIn 1817, Stephenson built an engine for the Duke of Portland, to haul\r\ncoal from Kilmarnock to Troon, which cost L750, and, with some\r\ninterruptions, this engine worked on that line until 1848, when it was\r\nbroken up. On November 18, 1822, the Hetton Railway, near Sunderland,\r\nwas opened. George Stephenson was the engineer of the line--a short\r\ntrack, 8 miles long, built from the Hetton Colliery to the docks on\r\nthe bank of the river Wear. On this line he put in five of the\r\n\"self-acting inclines\"--two inclines worked by stationary engines, the\r\ngradients being too heavy for locomotives--and used five\r\nlocomotive-engines of his own design, which were called by the people\r\nof the neighborhood, possibly for the first time, \"the iron horses.\"\r\nThese engines were quite similar to the Killingworth engine. They drew\r\na train of 17 coal-cars--a total load of 64 tons--about 4 miles an\r\nhour. Meantime, also, in 1823, Stephenson had been made engineer of\r\nthe Stockton & Darlington Railroad, which had been projected for the\r\npurpose of securing transportation to tide-water for the valuable\r\ncoal-lands of Durham. This road was built without an expectation on\r\nthe part of any of its promoters, Stephenson excepted, that steam\r\nwould be used as a motor to the exclusion of horses.\r\n\r\nMr. Edward Pearse, however, one of the largest holders of stock in the\r\nroad, and one of its most earnest advocates, became so convinced, by\r\nan examination of the Killingworth engines and their work, of the\r\nimmense advantage to be derived by their use, that he not only\r\nsupported Stephenson's arguments, but, with Thomas Richardson,\r\nadvanced L1,000 for the purpose of assisting Stephenson to commence\r\nthe business of locomotive-engine construction at Newcastle. This\r\nworkshop, which subsequently became a great and famous establishment,\r\nwas commenced in 1824.\r\n\r\nFor this road Stephenson recommended wrought-iron rails, which were\r\nthen costing L12 per ton--double the price of cast rails. The\r\ndirectors, however, stipulated that he should only buy one-half the\r\nrails required from the dealers in \"malleable\" iron. These rails\r\nweighed 20 pounds to the yard. After long hesitation, in the face of a\r\nserious opposition, the directors finally concluded to order three\r\nlocomotives of Stephenson. The first, or \"No. 1,\" engine (Fig. 52) was\r\ndelivered in time for the opening of the road, September 27, 1825. It\r\nweighed 8 tons. Its boiler contained a single straight flue, one end\r\nof which was the furnace. The cylinders were vertical, like those of\r\nthe earlier engines, and coupled directly to the driving-wheels. The\r\ncrank-pins were set in the wheels at right angles, in order that,\r\nwhile one engine was \"turning the centre,\" the other might exert its\r\nmaximum power. The two pairs of drivers were coupled by horizontal\r\nrods, as seen in the figure, which represents this engine as\r\nsubsequently mounted on a pedestal at the Darlington station. A\r\nsteam-blast in the chimney gave the requisite strength of draught.\r\nThese engines were built for slow and heavy work, but were capable of\r\nmaking what was then thought the satisfactorily high speed of 16 miles\r\nper hour. The inclines on the road were worked by fixed engines.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 52.--Stephenson's No. 1 Engine, 1825.]\r\n\r\nOn the opening day, which was celebrated as a holiday by the people\r\nfar and near, the No. 1 engine drew 90 tons at the rate of 12, and at\r\ntimes 15, miles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--Opening of the Stockton and Darlington\r\nRailroad, 1815. (After an old engraving.)]\r\n\r\nStephenson's engines were kept at work hauling coal-trains, but the\r\npassenger-coaches were all drawn for some time by horses, and the\r\nlatter system was a rude forerunner, in most respects, of modern\r\nstreet-railway transportation. Mixed passenger and freight trains were\r\nnext introduced, and, soon after, separate passenger-trains drawn by\r\nfaster engines were placed on the line, and the present system of\r\nrailroad transportation was now fairly inaugurated.\r\n\r\nA railroad between Manchester and Liverpool had been projected at\r\nabout the time that the Stockton & Darlington road was commenced. The\r\npreliminary surveys had been made in the face of strong opposition,\r\nwhich did not always stop at legal action and verbal attack, but in\r\nsome instances led to the display of force. The surveyors were\r\nsometimes driven from their work by a mob armed with sticks and\r\nstones, urged on by land-proprietors and those interested in the lines\r\nof coaches on the highway. Before the opening of the Stockton &\r\nDarlington Railroad, the Liverpool & Manchester bill had been carried\r\nthrough Parliament, after a very determined effort on the part of\r\ncoach-proprietors and landholders to defeat it, and Stephenson urged\r\nthe adoption of the locomotive to the exclusion of horses. It was his\r\nassertion, made at this time, that he could build a locomotive to run\r\n20 miles an hour, that provoked the celebrated rejoinder of a writer\r\nin the _Quarterly Review_, who was, however, in favor of the\r\nconstruction of the road and of the use of the locomotive upon it:\r\n\"What can be more palpably absurd and ridiculous, than the prospect\r\nheld out of locomotives traveling _twice as fast_ as stage-coaches? We\r\nwould as soon expect the people of Woolwich to suffer themselves to be\r\nfired off upon one of Congreve's ricochet-rockets, as trust themselves\r\nto the mercy of such a machine going at such a rate.\"\r\n\r\nIt was during his examination before a committee of the House of\r\nCommons, during this contest, that Stephenson, when asked, \"Suppose,\r\nnow, one of your engines to be going at the rate of 9 or 10 miles an\r\nhour, and that a cow were to stray upon the line and get in the way\r\nof the engine, would not that be a very awkward circumstance?\"\r\nreplied, \"Yes, _very_ awkward--_for the coo!_\" And when asked if men\r\nand animals would not be frightened by the red-hot smoke-pipe,\r\nanswered, \"But how would they know that it was not _painted?_\" The\r\nline was finally built, with George Rennie as consulting, and\r\nStephenson as principal constructing engineer.\r\n\r\nHis work on this road became one of the important elements of the\r\nsuccess, and one of the great causes of the distinction, which marked\r\nthe life of these rising engineers. The successful construction of\r\nthat part of the line which lay across \"Chat Moss,\" an unfathomable\r\nswampy deposit of peat, extending over an area of 12 square miles, and\r\nthe building of which had been repeatedly declared an impossibility,\r\nwas in itself sufficient to prove that the engineer who had\r\naccomplished it was no common man. Stephenson adopted the very simple\r\nyet bold expedient of using, as a filling, compacted turf and peat,\r\nand building a road-bed of materials lighter than water, or the\r\nsubstance composing the bog, and thus forming a _floating_ embankment,\r\non which he laid his rails. To the surprise of every one but\r\nStephenson himself, the plan proved perfectly successful, and even\r\nsurprisingly economical, costing but little more than one-tenth the\r\nestimate of at least one engineer. Among the other great works on this\r\nremarkable pioneer-line were the tunnel, a mile and a half long, from\r\nthe station at Liverpool to Edgehill; the Olive Mount deep-cut, two\r\nmiles long, and in some places 100 feet deep, through red sandstone,\r\nof which nearly 500,000 yards were removed; the Sankey Viaduct, a\r\nbrick structure of nine arches, of 50 feet span each, costing L45,000;\r\nand a number of other pieces of work which are noteworthy in even\r\nthese days of great works.\r\n\r\nStephenson planned all details of the line, and even designed the\r\nbridges, machinery, engines, turn-tables, switches, and crossings,\r\nand was responsible for every part of the work of their construction.\r\n\r\nFinally, the work of building the line approached completion, and it\r\nbecame necessary promptly to settle the long-deferred question of a\r\nmethod of applying motive-power. Some of the directors and their\r\nadvisers still advocated the use of horses; many thought stationary\r\nhauling-engines preferable; and the remainder were, almost to a man,\r\nundecided. The locomotive had no outspoken advocate, and few had the\r\nslightest faith in it. George Stephenson was almost alone, and the\r\nopponents of steam had secured a provision in the Newcastle & Carlisle\r\nRailroad concession, stipulating expressly that horses should there be\r\nexclusively employed. The directors did, however, in 1828, permit\r\nStephenson to put on the line a locomotive, to be used, during its\r\nconstruction, in hauling gravel-trains. A committee was sent, at\r\nStephenson's request, to see the Stockton & Darlington engines, but no\r\ndecided expression of opinion seems to have been made by them. Two\r\nwell-known professional engineers reported in favor of fixed engines,\r\nand advised the division of the line into 19 stages of about a mile\r\nand a half each, and the use of 21 fixed engines, although they\r\nadmitted the excessive first-cost of that system. The board was\r\nnaturally strongly inclined to adopt their plan. Stephenson, however,\r\nearnestly and persistently opposed such action, and, after long\r\ndebate, it was finally determined \"to give the traveling engine a\r\nchance.\" The board decided to offer a reward of L500 for the best\r\nlocomotive-engine, and prescribed the following conditions:\r\n\r\n  1. The engine must consume its own smoke.\r\n\r\n  2. The engine, if of 6 tons weight, must be able to draw after it,\r\n  day by day, 20 tons weight (including the tender and water-tank) at\r\n  10 miles an hour, with a pressure of steam on the boiler not\r\n  exceeding 50 pounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\n  3. The boiler must have two safety-valves, neither of which must be\r\n  fastened down, and one of them completely out of the control of the\r\n  engine-man.\r\n\r\n  4. The engine and boiler must be supported on springs, and rest on 6\r\n  wheels, the height of the whole not exceeding 15 feet to the top of\r\n  the chimney.\r\n\r\n  5. The engine, with water, must not weigh more than 6 tons; but an\r\n  engine of less weight would be preferred, on its drawing a\r\n  proportionate load behind it; if of only 4-1/2 tons, then it might\r\n  be put only on 4 wheels. The company to be at liberty to test the\r\n  boiler, etc., by a pressure of 150 pounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\n  6. A mercurial gauge must be affixed to the machine, showing the\r\n  steam-pressure above 45 pounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\n  7. The engine must be delivered, complete and ready for trial, at\r\n  the Liverpool end of the railway, not later than the 1st of October,\r\n  1829.\r\n\r\n  8. The price of the engine must not exceed L550.\r\n\r\nThis circular was printed and published throughout the kingdom, and a\r\nconsiderable number of engines were constructed to compete at the\r\ntrial, which was proposed to take place October 1, 1829, but which was\r\ndeferred to the 6th of that month. Only four engines, however, were\r\nfinally entered on the day of the trial. These were the \"Novelty,\"\r\nconstructed by Messrs. Braithwaite & Ericsson, the latter being the\r\ndistinguished engineer who subsequently came to the United States to\r\nintroduce screw-propulsion, and, later, the monitor system of\r\niron-clads; the \"Rocket,\" built from Stephenson's plans; and the\r\n\"Sanspareil\" and the \"Perseverance,\" built by Hackworth and Burstall,\r\nrespectively.\r\n\r\nThe \"Sanspareil,\" which was built under the direction of Timothy\r\nHackworth, one of Stephenson's earlier foremen, resembled the engine\r\nbuilt by the latter for the Stockton & Darlington road, but was\r\nheavier than had been stipulated, was not ready for work when called,\r\nand, when finally set at work, proved to be very extravagant in its\r\nuse of fuel, partly in consequence of the extreme intensity of its\r\nblast, which caused the expulsion of unconsumed coals from the\r\nfurnace.\r\n\r\nThe \"Perseverance\" could not attain the specified speed, and was\r\nwithdrawn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 54.--The \"Novelty,\" 1829.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Novelty\" was apparently a well-designed and for that time a\r\nremarkably well-proportioned machine. _A_, in Fig. 54, is the boiler,\r\n_D_ the steam-cylinders, _E_ a heater. Its weight but slightly\r\nexceeded three tons, and it was a \"tank engine,\" carrying its own fuel\r\nand water at _B_. A forced draught was obtained by means of the\r\nbellows, _C_. This engine was run over the line at the rate of about\r\n28 miles an hour at times, but its blowing apparatus failed, and the\r\n\"Rocket\" held the track alone. A later trial still left the \"Rocket\"\r\nalone in the field.\r\n\r\nThe \"Rocket\" (Fig. 55) was built at the works of Robert Stephenson &\r\nCo., at Newcastle-upon-Tyne. The boiler was given considerable\r\nheating-surface by the introduction of 25 3-inch copper tubes, at the\r\nsuggestion of Henry Booth, secretary of the railroad company. The\r\nblast was altered by gradually closing in the opening at the extremity\r\nof the exhaust-pipe, and thus \"sharpening\" it until it was found to\r\nhave the requisite intensity. The effect of this modification of the\r\nshape of the pipe was observed carefully by means of syphon\r\nwater-gauges attached to the chimney. The draft was finally given such\r\nan intensity as to raise the water 3 inches in the tube of the\r\ndraught-gauge. The total length of the boiler was 6 feet, its\r\ndiameter 40 inches. The fire-box was attached to the rear of the\r\nboiler, and was 3 feet high and 2 feet wide, with water-legs to\r\nprotect its side-sheets from injury by overheating. The cylinders, as\r\nseen in the sketch, were inclined, and coupled to a single pair of\r\ndriving-wheels. A tender, attached to the engine, carried the fuel and\r\nwater. The engine weighed less than 4-1/2 tons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 55.--The \"Rocket,\" 1829.]\r\n\r\nThe little engine does not seem to have been very prepossessing in\r\nappearance, and the \"Novelty\" is said to have been the general\r\nfavorite, the Stephenson engine having few, if any, backers among the\r\nspectators. On its first trial, it ran 12 miles in less than an hour.\r\n\r\nAfter the accident which disabled the \"Novelty,\" the \"Rocket\" came\r\nforward again, and ran at the rate of from 25 to 30 miles an hour,\r\ndrawing a single carriage carrying 30 passengers. Two days later, on\r\nthe 8th of October, steam was raised in a little less than an hour\r\nfrom cold water, and it then, with 13 tons of freight in the train,\r\nran 35 miles in 1 hour and 48 minutes, including stops, and attained a\r\nspeed of 29 miles an hour. The average of all runs for the trial was\r\n15 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nThis success, far exceeding the expectation of the most sanguine of\r\nthe advocates of the system, and greatly exceeding what had been\r\nasserted by opponents to be the bounds of possibility, settled\r\ncompletely the whole question, and the Manchester & Liverpool road was\r\nat once equipped with locomotive engines.\r\n\r\nThe \"Rocket\" remained on the line until 1837, when it was sold, and\r\nset at work by the purchasers on the Midgeholme Railway, near\r\nCarlisle. On one occasion, on this road, it was driven 4 miles in\r\n4-1/2 minutes. It is now in the Patent Museum at South Kensington,\r\nLondon.\r\n\r\nIn January, 1830, a single line of rails had been carried across Chat\r\nMoss, and, six months later, the first train, drawn by the \"Arrow,\"\r\nran through, June 14th, from Liverpool to Manchester, making the trip\r\nin an hour and a half, and attaining a maximum speed of over 27 miles\r\nan hour. The line was formally opened to traffic September 15, 1830.\r\n\r\nThis was one of the most notable occasions in the history of the\r\nrailroad, and the successful termination of the great work was\r\ncelebrated, as so important an event should be, by impressive\r\nceremonies. Among the distinguished spectators were Sir Robert Peel\r\nand the Duke of Wellington. Mr. Huskisson, a Member of Parliament for\r\nLiverpool, was also present. There had been built for the line, by\r\nRobert Stephenson & Co., 7 locomotives besides the \"Rocket,\" and a\r\nlarge number of carriages. These were all brought out in procession,\r\nand 600 passengers entered the train, which started for Manchester,\r\nand ran at times, on smooth portions of the road, at the rate of 20\r\nand 25 miles an hour. Crowds of people along the line cheered at this\r\nstrange and to them incomprehensible spectacle, and the story of the\r\nwonderful performances of that day on the new railroad was repeated in\r\nevery corner of the land. A sad accident, the precursor of thousands\r\nto follow the introduction of the new method of transportation, while\r\nit repressed the rising enthusiasm of the people and dampened the\r\nardor of the most earnest of the advocates of the railroad, occurring\r\nduring this trip, assisted in making known the power of the new motor\r\nand the danger attending its use as well. The trains stopped for water\r\nat Parkside, and occasion was taken to send the \"Northumbrian,\" an\r\nengine driven by George Stephenson himself, on a side track, with the\r\ncarriage containing the Duke of Wellington, and the other engines and\r\ntrains were all directed to be sent along the main track in view of\r\nthe Duke and his party. While this movement was in process of\r\nexecution, Mr. Huskisson, who had carelessly stood on the main line\r\nuntil the \"Rocket,\" which led the column, had nearly reached him,\r\nattempted to enter the carriage of the Duke. He was too late, and was\r\nstruck by the \"Rocket,\" thrown down across the rail, and the advancing\r\nengine crushed a leg so seriously that he died the same evening.\r\nImmediately after the accident, he was placed on the \"Northumbrian,\"\r\nand Stephenson made the 15 miles to the destination of the wounded man\r\nin 25 minutes--a speed of 36 miles an hour. The news of this accident,\r\nand the statement of the velocity of the engine, were published\r\nthroughout the kingdom and Europe; and the misfortune of this first\r\nvictim of a railroad accident was one of the causes of the immediate\r\nadoption and rapid spread of the modern railway system.\r\n\r\nThis road, which was built in the hope of securing 400 passengers per\r\nday, almost immediately averaged 1,200, and in five years reported\r\n500,000 passengers for the year.[54] The success of this road insured\r\nthe general introduction of railroads, and from this time forward\r\nthere was never a doubt of their ultimate adoption to the exclusion\r\nof every other system of general internal communication and\r\ntransportation.\r\n\r\n  [54] Smiles.\r\n\r\nFor some years after this his first great triumph, George Stephenson\r\ngave his whole time to the building of railroads and the improvement\r\nof the engine. He was assisted by his son Robert, to whom he gradually\r\nsurrendered his business, and retired to Tapton House, on the Midland\r\nRailway, and led a busy but pleasant life during the remaining years\r\nof his existence.\r\n\r\nEven as early as 1840, he seems to have projected many improvements\r\nwhich were only generally adopted many years later. He proposed\r\nself-acting and continuous systems of brake, and considered a good\r\nsystem of brake of so great importance, that he advocated their\r\ncompulsory introduction by State legislation. He advised moderate\r\nspeeds, from considerations both of safety and of expense.\r\n\r\nA few years after the opening of the Liverpool & Manchester road,\r\ngreat numbers of schemes were proposed by ignorant or designing men,\r\nwhich had for their object the filling of the pockets of their\r\nproposers rather than the benefit of the stockholders and the public;\r\nand the Stephensons were often called upon to combat these crude and\r\nill-digested plans. Among these was the pneumatic system of\r\npropulsion, already referred to as first proposed by Papin, in\r\ncombination with his double-acting air-pump, in 1687. It had been\r\nagain proposed in the early part of the present century by Medhurst,\r\nwho proposed a method of pneumatic transmission of small parcels and\r\nof letters, which is now in use, and, 15 years later, a railroad to\r\ntake the place of that of Stephenson and his coadjutors. The most\r\nsuccessful of several attempts to introduce this method was that of\r\nClegg & Samuda, at West London, and on the London & Croydon road, and\r\nagain in Ireland, between Kingstown and Dalkey. A line of pipe, _B B_,\r\nseen in Fig. 56, two feet in diameter, was laid between the rails, _A\r\nA_, of the road. This pipe was fitted with a nicely-packed piston,\r\ncarrying a strong arm, which rose through a slit made along the top of\r\nthe pipe, and covered by a flexible strip of leather, _E E_. This arm\r\nwas attached to the carriage, _C C_, to be propelled. The pressure of\r\nthe atmosphere being removed, by the action of a powerful pump, from\r\nthe side toward which the train was to advance, the pressure of the\r\natmosphere on the opposite side drove the piston forward, carrying the\r\ntrain with it. Stephenson was convinced, after examining the plans of\r\nthe projectors, that the scheme would fail, and so expressed himself.\r\nThose who favored it, however, had sufficient influence with\r\ncapitalists to secure repeated trials, although each was followed by\r\nfailure, and it was several years before the last was heard of this\r\nsystem.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 56.--The Atmospheric Railroad.]\r\n\r\nA considerable portion of several of the later years of Stephenson's\r\nlife was spent in traveling in Europe, partly on business and partly\r\nfor pleasure. During a visit to Belgium in 1845, he was received\r\neverywhere, and by all classes, from the king down to the humblest of\r\nhis subjects, with such distinction as is rarely accorded even to the\r\ngreatest men. He soon after visited Spain with Sir Joshua Walmsley, to\r\nreport on a proposed railway from the capital to the Bay of Biscay. On\r\nthis journey he was taken ill, and his health was permanently\r\nimpaired. Thenceforward he devoted himself principally to the\r\ndirection of his own property, which had become very considerable, and\r\nspent much of his time at the collieries and other works in which he\r\nhad invested it. His son had now entirely relieved him of all business\r\nconnected with railroads, and he had leisure to devote to\r\nself-improvement and social amusement. Among his friends he claimed\r\nSir Robert Peel, his old acquaintance, now Sir William, Fairbairn, Dr.\r\nBuckland, and many others of the distinguished men of that time.\r\n\r\nIn August, 1848, Stephenson was attacked with intermittent fever,\r\nsucceeded by haemorrhage from the lungs, and died on the 12th of that\r\nmonth, at the age of sixty-six years, honored of all men, and secure\r\nof an undying fame. Soon after his death, statues were erected at\r\nLiverpool, London, and Newcastle, the cost of the second of which was\r\ndefrayed by private subscriptions, including a contribution of about\r\n$1,500 by 3,150 workingmen--one of the finest tributes ever offered to\r\nthe memory of a great man.\r\n\r\nBut the noblest monument is that which he himself erected by the\r\nestablishment of a system of education and protection of his\r\nworking-people at Clay Cross. He made it a condition of employment\r\nthat every employe should contribute from five to twelve pence each\r\nfortnight to a fund, to which the works also made liberal\r\ncontributions. From that fund it was directed that the expenses of\r\nfree education of the children of the work-people, night-schools for\r\nthose employed in the works, a reading-room and library, medical\r\ntreatment, and a benevolent fund were to be defrayed. Music and\r\ncricket-clubs, and prize funds for the best garden, were also founded.\r\nThe school, public hall, and the church of Clay Cross, and this noble\r\nsystem of support, are together a nobler monument than any statue or\r\nsimilar structure could be.\r\n\r\nThe character of George Stephenson was in every way admirable. Simple,\r\nearnest, and honorable; courageous, indomitable, and industrious;\r\nhumorous, kind, and philanthropic, his memory will long be cherished,\r\nand will long prove an incentive to earnest effort and to the pursuit\r\nof an honorable fame with hundreds of the youth who, reading his\r\nsimple yet absorbing story, as told by his biographer, shall in later\r\nyears learn to know him.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 57.--Stephenson's Locomotive, 1833.]\r\n\r\nAfter the death of his father, Robert Stephenson continued, as he had\r\nalready done for several years, to conduct the business of building\r\nlocomotives, as well as of constructing railroads. The work of\r\nlocomotive engine-building was done at Newcastle, and for many years\r\nthose works were the principal engine-building establishment of the\r\nworld.\r\n\r\nAfter their introduction on the Liverpool & Manchester road, the\r\nengines of the firm of Robert Stephenson & Co. were rapidly modified,\r\nuntil they assumed the form shown in Fig. 57, which remained standard\r\nuntil their gradual increase in weight compelled the builders to place\r\na larger number of wheels beneath them, and make those other changes\r\nwhich finally resulted in the creation of distinct types for special\r\nkinds of work. In the engine of 1833, as shown above, the cylinders,\r\n_A_, are carried at the extreme forward end of the boiler, and the\r\ndriving-wheels, _B_, are coupled directly to the connecting-rod of the\r\nengine and to each other. A buffer, _C_, extends in front, and the\r\nrear end of the boiler is formed into a rectangular fire-box, _D_,\r\ncontinuous with the shell, _E_, and the flame and gases pass to the\r\nconnection and smoke-pipe, _F_, _G_, through a large number of small\r\ntubes, _a_. Steam is led to the cylinders by a steam-pipe, _H H_, to\r\nwhich it is admitted by the throttle-valve, _b_. A steam-dome, _I_,\r\nfrom which the steam is taken, assists by giving more steam-space far\r\nabove the water-line, and thus furnishing dry steam. The exhaust steam\r\nissues with great velocity into the chimney from the pipe, _J_, giving\r\ngreat intensity of draught. The engine-driver stands on the platform,\r\n_K_, from which all the valves and handles are accessible. Feed-pumps,\r\n_L_, supply the boiler with water, which is drawn from the tender\r\nthrough the pipes, _e_, _f_.\r\n\r\nThe valve-gear was then substantially what it is to-day, the\r\n\"Stephenson link\" (Fig. 58). On the driving-axle were keyed two\r\neccentrics, _E_, so set that the motion of the one was adapted to\r\ndriving the valve when the engine was moving forward, and the other\r\nwas arranged to move the valve when running backward. The former was\r\nconnected, through its strap and the rod, _B_, to the upper end of a\r\n\"strap-link,\" _A_, while the second was similarly connected with the\r\nlower end. By means of a handle, _L_, and the link, _n_, and its\r\nconnections, including the counterweighted bell-crank, _M_, this link\r\ncould be raised or depressed, thus bringing the pin on the link-block,\r\nto which the valve-stem was connected, into action with either\r\neccentric. Or, the link being set in mid-gear, the valve would cover\r\nboth steam-ports of the cylinder, and the engine could move neither\r\nway. As shown, the engine is in position to run backward. A series of\r\nnotches, _Z_, into either of which a catch on _L_ could be dropped,\r\nenabled the driver to place the link where he chose. In intermediate\r\npositions, between mid-gear and full-gear, the motion of the valve is\r\nsuch as to produce expansion of the steam, and some gain in economy of\r\nworking, although reducing the power of the engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 58.--The Stephenson Valve-Gear, 1833.]\r\n\r\nThe success of the railroad and the locomotive in Great Britain led to\r\nits rapid introduction in other countries. In France, as early as\r\n1823, M. Beaunier was authorized to construct a line of rails from the\r\ncoal-mines of St. Etienne to the Loire, using horses for the traction\r\nof his trains; and in 1826, MM. Seguin began a road from St. Etienne\r\nto Lyons. In 1832, engines built at Lyons were substituted for horses\r\non these roads, but internal agitations interrupted the progress of\r\nthe new system in France, and, for 10 years after the opening\r\nof the Manchester & Liverpool road, France remained without\r\nsteam-transportation on land.\r\n\r\nIn Belgium the introduction of the locomotive was more promptly\r\naccomplished. Under the direction of Pierre Simon, an enterprising and\r\nwell-informed young engineer, who had become known principally as an\r\nadvocate of the even then familiar project of a canal across the\r\nIsthmus of Darien, very complete plans of railroad communication for\r\nthe kingdom were prepared, in compliance with a decree dated July 31,\r\n1834, and were promptly authorized. The road between Brussels and\r\nMechlin was opened May 6, 1837, and other roads were soon built; and\r\nthe railway system of Belgium was the first on the Continent of\r\nEurope.\r\n\r\nThe first German railroad worked with locomotive steam-engines was\r\nthat between Nuremberg and Fuerth, built under the direction of M.\r\nDenis. The other European countries soon followed in this rapid march\r\nof improvement.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, public attention had been directed to this\r\nsubject, as has already been stated, very early in the present\r\ncentury, by Evans and Stevens. At that time the people of the United\r\nStates, as was natural, closely watched every important series of\r\nevents in the mother-country; and so remarkable and striking a change\r\nas that which was taking place in the time of Stephenson, in methods\r\nof communication and transportation, could not fail to attract general\r\nattention and awaken universal interest.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding the success of the early experiments of Evans and\r\nothers, and in spite of the statesmanlike arguments of Stevens and\r\nDearborn, and the earnest advocacy of the plan by all who were\r\nfamiliar with the revelations which were daily made of the power and\r\ncapabilities of the steam-engine, it was not until after the opening\r\nof the Manchester & Liverpool road that any action was taken looking\r\nto the introduction of the locomotive. Colonel John Stevens, in 1825,\r\nhad built a small locomotive, which he had placed on a circular\r\nrailway before his house--now Hudson Terrace--at Hoboken, to prove\r\nthat his statements had a basis of fact. This engine had two \"lantern\"\r\ntubular boilers, each composed of small iron tubes, arranged\r\nvertically in circles about the furnaces.[55] This exhibition had no\r\nother effect, however, than to create some interest in the subject,\r\nwhich aided in securing a rapid adoption of the railroad when once\r\nintroduced.\r\n\r\n  [55] One of these sectional boilers is still preserved in the\r\n  lecture-room of the author, at the Stevens Institute of Technology.\r\n\r\nThe first line of rails in the New England States is said to have been\r\nlaid down at Quincy, Mass., from the granite quarry to the Neponset\r\nRiver, three miles away, in 1826 and 1827. That between the coal-mines\r\nof Mauch Chunk, Pa., and the river Lehigh, nine miles distant, was\r\nbuilt in 1827. In the following year the Delaware & Hudson Canal\r\nCompany built a railroad from their mines to the termination of the\r\ncanal at Honesdale. These roads were worked either by gravity or by\r\nhorses and mules.\r\n\r\nThe competition at Rainhill, on the Liverpool and Manchester Railroad,\r\nhad been so widely advertised, and promised to afford such conclusive\r\nevidence relative to the value of the locomotive steam-engine and the\r\nrailroad, that engineers and others interested in the subject came\r\nfrom all parts of the world to witness the trial. Among the strangers\r\npresent were Mr. Horatio Allen, then chief-engineer of the Delaware &\r\nHudson Canal Company, and Mr. E. L. Miller, a resident of Charleston,\r\nS. C., who went from the United States for the express purpose of\r\nseeing the new machines tested.\r\n\r\nMr. Allen had been authorized to purchase, for the company with which\r\nhe was connected, three locomotives and the iron for the road, and had\r\nalready shipped one engine to the United States, and had set it at\r\nwork on the road. This engine was received in New York in May, 1829,\r\nand its trial took place in August at Honesdale, Mr. Allen himself\r\ndriving the engine. But the track proved too light for the locomotive,\r\nand it was laid up and never set at regular work. This engine was\r\ncalled the \"Stourbridge Lion\"; it was built by Foster, Rastrick & Co.,\r\nof Stourbridge, England. During the summer of the next year, a small\r\nexperimental engine, which was built in 1829 by Peter Cooper, of New\r\nYork, was successfully tried on the Baltimore & Ohio Railroad, at\r\nBaltimore, making 13 miles in less than an hour, and moving, at some\r\npoints on the road, at the rate of 18 miles an hour. One carriage\r\ncarrying 36 passengers was attached. This was considered a\r\nworking-model only, and was rated at one horse-power.\r\n\r\nRoss Winans, writing of this trial of Cooper's engine, makes a\r\ncomparison with the work done by Stephenson's \"Rocket,\" and claims a\r\ndecided superiority for the former. He concluded that the trial\r\nestablished fully the practicability of using locomotives on the\r\nBaltimore & Ohio road at high speeds, and on all its curves and heavy\r\ngradients, without inconvenience or danger.\r\n\r\nThis engine had a vertical tubular boiler, and the draught was urged,\r\nlike that of the \"Novelty\" at Liverpool, by mechanical means--a\r\nrevolving fan. The single steam-cylinder was 3-1/4 inches in diameter,\r\nand the stroke of piston 14-1/2 inches. The wheels were 30 inches in\r\ndiameter, and connected to the crank-shaft by gearing. The engine, on\r\nthe trial, worked up to 1.43 horse-power, and drew a gross weight of\r\n4-1/2 tons. Mr. Cooper, unable to find such tubes as he needed for his\r\nboiler, used gun-barrels. The whole machine weighed less than a ton.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Davis & Gartner, a little later, built the \"York\" for this\r\nroad--a locomotive having also a vertical boiler, of very similar form\r\nto the modern steam fire-engine boiler, 51 inches in diameter, and\r\ncontaining 282 fire-tubes, 16 inches long, and tapering from 1-1/2\r\ninches diameter at the bottom to 1-1/4 at the top, where the gases\r\nwere discharged through a combustion-chamber into a steam-chimney.\r\nThis engine weighed 3-1/2 tons.\r\n\r\nThey subsequently built several \"grasshopper\" engines (Fig. 59), some\r\nof which ran many years, doing good work, and one or two of which are\r\nstill in existence. The first--the \"Atlantic\"--was set at work in\r\nSeptember, 1832, and hauled 50 tons from Baltimore 40 miles, over\r\ngradients having a maximum rise of 37 feet to the mile, and on curves\r\nhaving a minimum radius of 400 feet, at the rate of 12 to 15 miles an\r\nhour. This engine weighed 6-1/2 tons, carried 50 pounds of steam--a\r\npressure then common on both continents --and burned a ton of\r\nanthracite coal on the round trip. The blast was secured by a fan, and\r\nthe valve-gear was worked by cams instead of eccentrics. This engine\r\nmade the round trip at a cost of $16, doing the work of 42 horses,\r\nwhich had cost $33 per trip. The engine cost $4,500, and was designed\r\nby Phineas Davis, assisted by Ross Winans.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 59.--The \"Atlantic,\" 1882.]\r\n\r\nMr. Miller, on his return from the Liverpool & Manchester trial,\r\nordered a locomotive for the Charleston & Hamburg Railroad from the\r\nWest Point Foundery. This engine was guaranteed by Mr. Miller to draw\r\nthree times its weight at the rate of 10 miles an hour. It was built\r\nduring the summer of 1830, from the plans of Mr. Miller, and reached\r\nCharleston in October. The trials were made in November and December.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 60.--The \"Best Friend,\" 1830.]\r\n\r\nThis engine (Fig. 60) had a vertical tubular boiler, in which the\r\ngases rose through a very high fire-box, into which large numbers of\r\nrods projected from the sides and top, and passed out through tubes\r\nleading them laterally outward into an outside jacket, through which\r\nthey rose to the chimney. The steam-cylinders were two in number, 8\r\ninches in diameter and of 16 inches stroke, inclined so as to connect\r\nwith the driving-axle. The four wheels were all of the same size,\r\n4-1/2 feet in diameter, and connected by coupling-rods. The engine\r\nweighed 4-1/2 tons. The \"Best Friend,\" as it was called, did excellent\r\nwork until June, 1831, when the explosion of the boiler, in\r\nconsequence of the recklessness of the fireman, unexpectedly closed\r\nits career.\r\n\r\nA second engine (Fig. 61) was built for this road, at the West Point\r\nFoundery, from plans furnished by Horatio Allen, and was received and\r\nset at work early in the spring of 1831. The engine, called the \"West\r\nPoint,\" had a horizontal tubular boiler, but was in other respects\r\nvery similar to the \"Best Friend.\" It is said to have done very good\r\nwork.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 61.--The \"West Point,\" 1831.]\r\n\r\nThe Mohawk & Hudson Railroad ordered an engine at about this time,\r\nalso, of the West Point Foundery, and the trials, made in July and\r\nAugust, 1831, proved thoroughly successful.\r\n\r\nThis engine, the \"De Witt Clinton,\" was contracted for by John B.\r\nJervis, and fitted up by David Matthew. It had two steam-cylinders,\r\neach 5-1/2 inches in diameter and 16 inches stroke of piston. The\r\nconnecting-rods were directly attached to a cranked axle, and turned\r\nfour coupled wheels 4-1/2 feet in diameter. These wheels had cast-iron\r\nhubs and wrought-iron spokes and tires. The tubes were of copper,\r\n2-1/2 inches in diameter and 6 feet long. The engine weighed 3-1/2\r\ntons, and hauled 5 cars at the rate of 30 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nAnother engine, the \"South Carolina\" (Fig. 62), was designed by\r\nHoratio Allen for the South Carolina Railroad, and completed late in\r\nthe year 1831. This was the first eight-wheeled engine, and the\r\nprototype, also, of a peculiar and lately-revived form of engine.\r\n\r\nIn the summer of 1832, an engine built by Messrs. Davis & Gartner, of\r\nYork, Pa., was put on the Baltimore & Ohio road, which at times\r\nattained a speed, unloaded, of 30 miles an hour. The engine weighed\r\n3-1/2 tons, and drew, usually, 4 cars, weighing altogether 14 tons,\r\nfrom Baltimore to Ellicott's Mills, a distance of 13 miles, in the\r\nschedule-time, one hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 62.--The \"South Carolina,\" 1831.]\r\n\r\nHoratio Allen's engine on the South Carolina Railroad is said to have\r\nbeen the first eight-wheeled engine ever built.\r\n\r\nIt was at about the time of which we are now writing that the first\r\nlocomotive was built of what is now distinctively known as the\r\nAmerican type--an engine with a \"truck\" or \"bogie\" under the forward\r\nend of the boiler. This was the \"American\" No. 1, built at the West\r\nPoint Foundery, from plans furnished by John B. Jervis, Chief\r\nEngineer, for the Mohawk & Hudson Railroad. Ross Winans had already\r\n(1831) introduced the passenger-car with swiveling trucks.[56] It was\r\ncompleted in August, 1832, and is said by Mr. Matthew to have been an\r\nextremely fast and smooth-running engine. A mile a minute was\r\nrepeatedly attained, and it is stated by the same authority,[57] that\r\na speed of 80 miles an hour was sometimes made over a single mile.\r\nThis engine had cylinders 9-1/2 inches diameter, 16 inches stroke of\r\npiston, two pairs of driving-wheels, coupled, 5 feet in diameter each;\r\nand the truck had four 33-inch wheels. The boiler contained tubes 3\r\ninches in diameter, and its fire-box was 5 feet long and 2 feet 10\r\ninches wide. Robert Stephenson & Co. subsequently built a similar\r\nengine, from the plans of Mr. Jervis, and for the same road. It was\r\nset at work in 1833. In both engines the driving-wheels were behind\r\nthe fire-box. This engine is another illustration of the fact--shown\r\nby the description already given of other and earlier engines--that\r\nthe independence of the American mechanic, and the boldness and\r\nself-confidence which have to the present time distinguished him, were\r\namong the earliest of the fruits of our political independence and\r\nfreedom.\r\n\r\n  [56] \"History of the First Locomotives in America,\" Brown.\r\n\r\n  [57] \"Ross Winans _vs._ The Eastern Railroad Company--Evidence.\"\r\n  Boston, 1854.\r\n\r\nThese American engines were all designed to burn anthracite coal. The\r\nEnglish locomotives all burned bituminous coal.\r\n\r\nRobert L. Stevens, the President and Engineer of the Camden & Amboy\r\nRailroad, and a distinguished son of Colonel John Stevens, of Hoboken,\r\nwas engaged, at the time of the opening of the Liverpool & Manchester\r\nRailroad, in the construction of the Camden & Amboy Railroad. It was\r\nhere that the first of the now standard form of _T_-rail was laid\r\ndown. It was of malleable iron, and of the form shown in the\r\naccompanying figure. It was designed by Mr. Stevens, and is known in\r\nthe United States as the \"Stevens\" rail. In Europe, where it was\r\nintroduced some years afterward, it is sometimes called the\r\n\"Vignolles\" rail. He purchased an engine of the Stephensons soon after\r\nthe trial at Rainhill, and this engine, the \"John Bull,\" was set up on\r\nthe then uncompleted road at Bordentown, in the year 1831. Its first\r\npublic trial was made in November of that year. The road was opened\r\nfor traffic, from end to end, two years later. This engine had\r\nsteam-cylinders 9 inches in diameter, 2 feet stroke of piston, one\r\npair of drivers 4-1/2 feet in diameter, and weighed 10 tons. This\r\nengine, and that built by Phineas Davis for the Baltimore & Ohio\r\nRailroad, were exhibited at the Centennial Exhibition at Philadelphia,\r\nin the year 1876.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 63.--The \"Stevens\" Rail. Enlarged Section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 64.--\"Old Ironsides,\" 1832.]\r\n\r\nEngines supplied to the Camden & Amboy Railroad subsequent to 1831\r\nwere built from the designs of Robert L. Stevens, in the shop of the\r\nMessrs. Stevens, at Hoboken. The other principal roads of the country,\r\nat first, very generally purchased their engines of the Baldwin\r\nLocomotive Works, then a small shop owned by Matthias W. Baldwin.\r\nBaldwin's first engine was a little model built for Peale's Museum, to\r\nillustrate to the visitors of that then well-known place of\r\nentertainment the character of the new motor, the success of which,\r\nat Rainhill, had just then excited the attention of the world. This\r\nwas in 1831, and the successful working of this little model led to\r\nhis receiving an order for an engine from the Philadelphia &\r\nGermantown Railroad. Mr. Baldwin, after studying the new engine of the\r\nCamden & Amboy road, made his plans, and built an engine (Fig. 64),\r\ncompleting it in the autumn of 1832, and setting it in operation\r\nNovember 23d of that year. It was kept at work on that line of road\r\nfor a period of 20 years or more. This engine was of Stephenson's\r\n\"Planet\" class, mounted on two driving-wheels 4-1/2 feet in diameter\r\neach, and two separate wheels of the same size, uncoupled. The\r\nsteam-cylinders were 9-1/2 inches in diameter, 18 inches stroke of\r\npiston, and were placed horizontally on each side of the smoke-box.\r\nThe boiler, 2-1/2 feet in diameter, contained 72 copper tubes 1-1/2\r\ninches in diameter and 7 feet long. The engine cost the railroad\r\ncompany $3,500. On the trial, steam was raised in 20 minutes, and the\r\nmaximum speed noted was 28 miles an hour. The engine subsequently\r\nattained a speed of over 30 miles. In 1834, Mr. Baldwin completed for\r\nMr. E. L. Miller, of Charleston, a six-wheeled engine, the \"E. L.\r\nMiller\" (Fig. 65), with cylinders 10 inches in diameter and 16 inches\r\nstroke of piston. He made the boiler of this engine of a form which\r\nremained standard many years, with a high dome over the fire-box. At\r\nabout the same time, he built the \"Lancaster,\" an engine resembling\r\nthe \"Miller,\" for the State road to Columbia, and several others were\r\nsoon contracted for and built. By the end of 1834, 5 engines had been\r\nbuilt by him, and the construction of locomotive-engines had become\r\none of the leading and most promising industries of the United States.\r\nMr. William Norris established a shop in Philadelphia in 1832, which\r\nhe gradually enlarged until it, like the Baldwin Works, became a large\r\nestablishment. He usually built a six-wheeled engine, with a\r\nleading-truck or bogie, and placed his driving-wheels in front of the\r\nfire-box.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 65.--The \"E. L. Miller,\" 1834.]\r\n\r\nAt this time the English locomotives were built to carry 60 pounds of\r\nsteam. The American builders adopted pressures of 120 to 130 pounds\r\nper square inch, the now generally standard pressures throughout the\r\nworld. In the years 1836 and 1837, Baldwin built 80 engines. They were\r\nof three classes: 1st, with cylinders 12-1/2 inches in diameter and of\r\n16 inches stroke, weighing 12 tons; 2d, with cylinders 12 by 16, and\r\na weight of 10-1/2 tons; and 3d, engines weighing 9 tons, and having\r\nsteam-cylinders of 10-1/2 inches diameter and of the same stroke. The\r\ndriving-wheels were usually 4-1/2 feet in diameter, and the cylinder\r\n\"inside-connected\" to cranked axles. A few \"outside-connected\" engines\r\nwere made, this plan becoming generally adopted at a later period.\r\n\r\nThe railroads of the United States were very soon supplied with\r\nlocomotive-engines built in America. In the year 1836, William Norris,\r\nwho had two years before purchased the interest of Colonel Stephen H.\r\nLong, an army-officer who patented and built locomotives of his own\r\ndesign, built the \"George Washington,\" and set it at work. This\r\nengine, weighing 14,400 pounds, drew 19,200 pounds up an incline 2,800\r\nfeet long, rising 369 feet to the mile, at the speed of 15-1/2 miles\r\nan hour. This showed an adhesion not far from one-third the weight on\r\nthe driving-wheels. This was considered a very wonderful performance,\r\nand it produced such an impression at the time, that several copies of\r\nthe \"George Washington\" were made, on orders from British railroads,\r\nand the result was the establishment of the reputation of the\r\nlocomotive-engine builders of the United States upon a foundation\r\nwhich has never since failed them. The engine had Jervis's\r\nforward-truck, now always seen under standard engines, which had\r\nalready been placed under railroad-cars by Ross Winans.\r\n\r\nIn New England, the Locks & Canals Company, of Lowell, began building\r\nengines as early as 1834, copying the Stephenson engine. Hinckley &\r\nDrury, of Boston, commenced building an outside-connected engine in\r\n1840, and their successors, the Boston Locomotive Works, became the\r\nlargest manufacturing establishment of the kind in New England. Two\r\nyears later, Ross Winans, the Baltimore builder, introduced some of\r\nhis engines upon Eastern railroads, fitting them with upright boilers,\r\nand burning anthracite coal.\r\n\r\nThe changes which have been outlined produced the now typical American\r\nlocomotive. It was necessarily given such form that it would work\r\nsafely and efficiently on rough, ill-ballasted, and often\r\nsharply-winding tracks; and thus it soon became evident that the two\r\npairs of coupled driving-wheels, carrying two-thirds the weight of the\r\nwhole engine, the forward-truck, and the system of \"equalizing\"\r\nsuspension-bars, by which the weight is distributed fairly among all\r\nthe wheels, whatever the position of the engine, or whatever the\r\nirregularity of the track, made it the very best of all known types of\r\nlocomotive for the railroads of a new country. Experience has shown it\r\nequally excellent on the smoothest and best of roads. The\r\n\"cow-catcher,\" placed in front to remove obstacles from the track, the\r\nbell, and the heavy whistle, are characteristics of the American\r\nengine also. The severity of winter-storms compelled the adoption of\r\nthe \"cab,\" or house, and the use of wood for fuel led to the invention\r\nof the \"spark-arrester\" for that class of engines. The heavy grades on\r\nmany roads led to the use of the \"sand-box,\" from which sand was\r\nsprinkled on the track, to prevent the slipping of the wheels.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1836, the now standard chilled wheel was introduced for\r\ncars and trucks; the single eccentric, which had been, until then,\r\nused on Baldwin engines, was displaced by the double eccentric, with\r\nhooks in place of the link; and, a year later, the iron frame took the\r\nplace of the previously-used wooden frame on all engines.\r\n\r\nThe year 1837 introduced a period of great depression in all branches\r\nof industry, which continued until the year 1840, or later, and\r\nseriously checked all kinds of manufacturing, including the building\r\nof locomotives. On the revival of business, numbers of new\r\nlocomotive-works were started, and in these establishments originated\r\nmany new types of engine, each of the more successful of which was\r\nadapted to some peculiar set of conditions. This variety of type is\r\nstill seen on nearly all of the principal roads.\r\n\r\nThe direction of change in the construction of locomotive-engines at\r\nthe period at which this division of the subject terminates is very\r\nwell indicated in a letter from Robert Stephenson to Robert L.\r\nStevens, dated 1833, which is now preserved at the Stevens Institute\r\nof Technology. He writes: \"I am sorry that the feeling in the United\r\nStates in favor of light railways is so general. In England we are\r\nmaking every succeeding railway stronger and more substantial.\" He\r\nadds: \"Small engines are losing ground, and large ones are daily\r\ndemonstrating that powerful engines are the most economical.\" He gives\r\na sketch of his latest engine, weighing _nine tons_, and capable, as\r\nhe states, of \"taking 100 tons, gross load, at the rate of 16 or 17\r\nmiles an hour on a level.\" To-day there are engines built weighing 70\r\ntons, and our locomotive-builders have standard sizes guaranteed to\r\ndraw over 2,000 tons on a good and level track.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER V.\r\n\r\n_THE MODERN STEAM-ENGINE._\r\n\r\n  \"Voila la plus merveilleuse de toutes les Machines; le Mecanisme\r\n  ressemble a celui des animaux.

Cette Machine a pris sa naissance en\r\n  Angleterre, et toutes les Machines a feu qu'on a construites\r\n  ailleurs que dans la Grande Bretagne ont ete executees par des\r\n  Anglais.\"--BELIDOR.\r\n\r\nTHE SECOND PERIOD OF APPLICATION--1800-1850 (CONTINUED). THE\r\nSTEAM-ENGINE APPLIED TO SHIP-PROPULSION.\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the most obviously important and most inconceivably fruitful of\r\nall the applications of steam which marked the period we are now\r\nstudying, is that of the steam-engine to the propulsion of vessels.\r\nThis direction of application has been that which has, from the\r\nearliest period in the history of the steam-engine, attracted the\r\nattention of the political economist and the historian, as well as the\r\nmechanician, whenever a new improvement, or the revival of an old\r\ndevice, has awakened a faint conception of the possibilities attendant\r\nupon the introduction of a machine capable of making so great a force\r\navailable. The realization of the hopes, the prophecies, and the\r\naspirations of earlier times, in the modern marine steam-engine, may\r\nbe justly regarded as the greatest of all the triumphs of mechanical\r\nengineering. Although, as has already been stated, attempts were made\r\nat a very early period to effect this application of steam-power, they\r\nwere not successful, and the steamship is a product of the present\r\ncentury. No such attempts were commercially successful until after the\r\ntime of Newcomen and Watt, and at the commencement of the nineteenth\r\ncentury. It is, indeed, but a few years since the passage across the\r\nAtlantic was frequently made in sailing-vessels, and the dangers, the\r\ndiscomforts, and the irregularities of their trips were most serious.\r\nNow, hardly a day passes that does not see several large and powerful\r\nsteamers leaving the ports of New York and Liverpool to make the same\r\nvoyages, and their passages are made with such regularity and safety,\r\nthat travelers can anticipate with confidence the time of their\r\narrival at the termination of their voyage to a day, and can cross\r\nwith safety and with comparative comfort even amid the storms of\r\nwinter. Yet all that we to-day see of the extent and the efficiency of\r\nsteam-navigation has been the work of the present century, and it may\r\nwell excite our wonder and our admiration.\r\n\r\nThe history of this development of the use of steam-power illustrates\r\nmost perfectly that process of growth of this invention which has been\r\nalready referred to; and we can here trace it, step by step, from the\r\nearliest and rudest devices up to those most recent and most perfect\r\ndesigns which represent the most successful existing types of the\r\nheat-engine--whether considered with reference to its design and\r\nconstruction, or as the highest application of known scientific\r\nprinciples--that have yet been seen in even the present advanced state\r\nof the mechanic arts.\r\n\r\nThe paddle-wheel was used as a substitute for oars at a very early\r\ndate, and a description of paddle-wheels applied to vessels, curiously\r\nillustrated by a large wood-cut, may be found in the work of Fammelli,\r\n\"De l'artificioses machines,\" published in old French in 1588.\r\nClark[58] quotes from Ogilby's edition of the \"Odyssey\" a stanza\r\nwhich reads like a prophecy, and almost awakens a belief that the\r\ngreat poet had a knowledge of steam-vessels in those early times--a\r\nthousand years before the Christian era. The prince thus addresses\r\nUlysses:\r\n\r\n  [58] \"Steam and the Steam-Engine.\"\r\n\r\n    \"We use nor Helm nor Helms-man. Our tall ships\r\n    Have Souls, and plow with Reason up the deeps;\r\n    All cities, Countries know, and where they list,\r\n    Through billows glide, veiled in obscuring Mist;\r\n    Nor fear they Rocks, nor Dangers on the way.\"\r\n\r\nPope's translation[59] furnishes the following rendering of Homer's\r\nprophecy:\r\n\r\n  [59] \"Odyssey,\" Book VIII., p. 175.\r\n\r\n    \"So shalt thou instant reach the realm assigned,\r\n    In wondrous ships, self-moved, instinct with mind;\r\n\r\n    ...\r\n\r\n    Though clouds and darkness veil the encumbered sky,\r\n    Fearless, through darkness and through clouds they fly.\r\n    Though tempests rage, though rolls the swelling main,\r\n    The seas may roll, the tempests swell in vain;\r\n    E'en the stern god that o'er the waves presides,\r\n    Safe as they pass and safe repass the tide,\r\n    With fury burns; while, careless, they convey\r\n    Promiscuous every guest to every bay.\"\r\n\r\nIt is stated that the Roman army under Claudius Caudex was taken\r\nacross to Sicily in boats propelled by paddle-wheels turned by oxen.\r\nVulturius gives pictures of such vessels.\r\n\r\nThis application of the force of steam was very possibly anticipated\r\n600 years ago by Roger Bacon, the learned Franciscan monk, who, in an\r\nage of ignorance and intellectual torpor, wrote:\r\n\r\n\"I will now mention some wonderful works of art and nature, in which\r\nthere is nothing of magic, and which magic could not perform.\r\nInstruments may be made by which the largest ships, with only one man\r\nguiding them, will be carried with greater velocity than if they were\r\nfull of sailors,\" etc., etc.\r\n\r\nDarwin's poetical prophecy was published long years before Watt's\r\nengine rendered its partial fulfillment a possibility; and thus, for\r\nmany years before even the first promising effort had been made, the\r\nminds of the more intelligent had been prepared to appreciate the\r\ninvention when it should finally be brought forward.\r\n\r\nThe earliest attempt to propel a vessel by steam is claimed by Spanish\r\nauthorities, as has been stated, to have been made by Blasco de Garay,\r\nin the harbor of Barcelona, Spain, in 1543. The record, claimed as\r\nhaving been extracted from the Spanish archives at Simancas, states\r\nthe vessel to have been of 200 tons burden, and to have been moved by\r\npaddle-wheels; and it is added that the spectators saw, although not\r\nallowed closely to inspect the apparatus, that one part of it was a\r\n\"vessel of boiling water\"; and it is also stated that objection was\r\nmade to the use of this part of the machine, because of the danger of\r\nexplosion.\r\n\r\nThe account seems somewhat apocryphal, and it certainly led to no\r\nuseful results.\r\n\r\nIn an anonymous English pamphlet, published in 1651, which is supposed\r\nby Stuart to have been written by the Marquis of Worcester, an\r\nindefinite reference to what may probably have been the steam-engine\r\nis made, and it is there stated to be capable of successful\r\napplication to propelling boats.\r\n\r\nIn 1690, Papin proposed to use his piston-engine to drive\r\npaddle-wheels to propel vessels; and in 1707 he applied the\r\nsteam-engine, which he had proposed as a pumping-engine, to driving a\r\nmodel boat on the Fulda at Cassel. In this trial he used the\r\narrangement of which a sketch has been shown, his pumping-engine\r\nforcing up water to turn a water-wheel, which, in turn, was made to\r\ndrive the paddles. An account of his experiments is to be found in\r\nmanuscript in the correspondence between Leibnitz and Papin, preserved\r\nin the Royal Library at Hanover. Professor Joy found there the\r\nfollowing letter:[60]\r\n\r\n  \"Dionysius Papin, Councillor and Physician to his Royal Highness the\r\n  Elector of Cassel, also Professor of Mathematics at Marburg, is\r\n  about to dispatch a vessel of singular construction down the river\r\n  Weser to Bremen. As he learns that all ships coming from Cassel, or\r\n  any point on the Fulda, are not permitted to enter the Weser, but\r\n  are required to unload at Muenden, and as he anticipates some\r\n  difficulty, although those vessels have a different object, his own\r\n  not being intended for freight, he begs most humbly that a gracious\r\n  order be granted that his ship may be allowed to pass unmolested\r\n  through the Electoral domain; which petition I most humbly support.\r\n\r\n                                                        G. W. LEIBNITZ.\r\n  \"HANOVER, _July 13, 1707_.\"\r\n\r\nThis letter was returned to Leibnitz, with the following indorsement:\r\n\r\n  \"The Electoral Councillors have found serious obstacles in the way of\r\n  granting the above petition, and, without giving their reasons, have\r\n  directed me to inform you of their decision, and that, in consequence,\r\n  the request is not granted by his Electoral Highness.\r\n\r\n                                                             H. REICHE.\r\n  \"HANOVER, _July 25, 1707_.\"\r\n\r\n  [60] _Scientific American_, February 24, 1877.\r\n\r\nThis failure of Papin's petition was the death-blow to his effort to\r\nestablish steam-navigation. A mob of boatmen, who thought they saw in\r\nthe embryo steamship the ruin of their business, attacked the vessel\r\nat night, and utterly destroyed it. Papin narrowly escaped with his\r\nlife, and fled to England.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1736, Jonathan Hulls took out an English patent for the\r\nuse of a steam-engine for ship-propulsion, proposing to employ his\r\nsteamboat in towing. In 1737 he published a well-written pamphlet,\r\ndescribing this apparatus, which is shown in Fig. 66, a reduced\r\nfac-simile of the plate accompanying his paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 66.--Hulls's Steamboat, 1736.]\r\n\r\nHe proposed using the Newcomen engine, fitted with a\r\ncounterpoise-weight and a system of ropes and grooved wheels, which,\r\nby a peculiar ratchet-like action, gave a continuous rotary motion.\r\nHis vessel was to have been used as a tow-boat. He says, in his\r\ndescription: \"In some convenient part of the Tow-boat there is placed\r\na Vessel about two-3rds full of water, with the Top closed; and this\r\nVessel being kept Boiling, rarifies the Water into a Steam, this Steam\r\nbeing convey'd thro' a large pipe into a cylindrical Vessel, and there\r\ncondensed, makes a Vacuum, which causes the weight of the atmosphere\r\nto press down on this Vessel, and so presses down a Piston that is\r\nfitted into this Cylindrical Vessel, in the same manner as in Mr.\r\nNewcomen's Engine, with which he raises Water by Fire.\r\n\r\n\"_P_, the Pipe coming from the Furnace to the Cylinder. _Q_, the\r\nCylinder wherein the steam is condensed. _R_, the Valve that stops the\r\nSteam from coming into the Cylinder, whilst the Steam within the same\r\nis condensed. _S_, the Pipe to convey the condensing Water into the\r\nCylinder. _T_, a cock to let in the condensing Water when the Cylinder\r\nis full of Steam and the Valve, _P_, is shut. _U_, a Rope fixed to the\r\nPiston that slides up and down in the Cylinder.\r\n\r\n\"_Note._ This Rope, _U_, is the same Rope that goes round the wheel,\r\n_D_, in the machine.\"\r\n\r\nIn the large division of his plate, _A_ is the chimney; _B_ is the\r\ntow-boat; _C C_ is the frame carrying the engine; _Da_, _D_, and _Db_\r\nare three wheels carrying the ropes _M_, _Fb_, and _Fa_, _M_ being the\r\nrope _U_ of his smaller figure, 30. _Ha_ and _Hb_ are two wheels on\r\nthe paddle-shafts, _I I_, arranged with pawls so that the\r\npaddle-wheel, _I I_, always turns the same way, though the wheels _Ha_\r\nand _Hb_ are given a reciprocating motion; _Fb_ is a rope connecting\r\nthe wheels in the vessel, _Db_, with the wheels at the stern. Hulls\r\nsays:\r\n\r\n\"When the Weight, _G_, is so raised, while the wheels _Da_, _D_, and\r\n_Db_ are moving backward, the Rope _Fa_ gives way, and the Power of\r\nthe Weight, _G_, brings the Wheel _Ha_ forward, and the Fans with it,\r\nso that the Fans always keep going forward, notwithstanding the Wheels\r\n_Da_, _D_, and _Db_ move backward and forward as the Piston moves up\r\nand down in the Cylinder. _L L_ are Teeth for a Catch to drop in from\r\nthe Axis, and are so contrived that they catch in an alternate manner,\r\nto cause the Fan to move always forward, for the Wheel _Ha_, by the\r\npower of the weight, _G_, is performing his Office while the other\r\nwheel, _Hb_, goes back in order to fetch another stroke.\r\n\r\n\"_Note._ The weight, _G_, must contain but half the weight of the\r\nPillar of Air pressing on the Piston, because the weight, _G_, is\r\nraised at the same time as the Wheel _Hb_ performs its Office, so that\r\nit is in effect two Machines acting alternately, by the weight of one\r\nPillar of Air, of such a Diameter as the Diameter of the Cylinder is.\"\r\n\r\nThe inventor suggests the use of timber guards to protect the wheels\r\nfrom injury, and, in shallow water, the attachment to the\r\npaddle-shafts of cranks \"to strike a Shaft to the Bottom of the River,\r\nwhich will drive the Vessel forward with the greater Force.\" He\r\nconcludes: \"Thus I have endeavoured to give a clear and satisfactory\r\nAccount of my New-invented Machine, for carrying Vessels out of and\r\ninto any Port, Harbour, or River, against Wind and Tide, or in a Calm;\r\nand I doubt not but whoever shall give himself the Trouble to peruse\r\nthis Essay, will be so candid as to excuse or overlook any\r\nImperfections in the diction or manner of writing, considering the\r\nHand it comes from, if what I have imagined may only appear as plain\r\nto others as it has done to me, viz., That the Scheme I now offer is\r\nPracticable, and if encouraged will be Useful.\"\r\n\r\nThere is no positive evidence that Hulls ever put his scheme to the\r\ntest of experiment, although tradition does say that he made a model,\r\nwhich he tried with such ill success as to prevent his prosecution of\r\nthe experiment further; and doggerel rhymes are still extant which\r\nwere sung by his neighbors in derision of his folly, as they\r\nconsidered it.\r\n\r\nA prize was awarded by the French Academy of Sciences, in 1752, for\r\nthe best essay on the manner of impelling vessels without wind. It was\r\ngiven to Bernouilli, who, in his paper, proposed a set of vanes like\r\nthose of a windmill--a screw, in fact--one to be placed on each side\r\nof the vessel, and two more behind. For a vessel of 100 tons, he\r\nproposed a shaft 14 feet long and 2 inches in diameter, carrying\r\n\"eight wheels, for acting on the water, to each of which it\" (the\r\nshaft) \"is perpendicular, and forms an axis for them all; the wheels\r\nshould be at equal distances from each other. Each wheel consists of 8\r\narms of iron, each 3 feet long, so that the whole diameter of the\r\nwheel is 6 feet. Each of these arms, at the distance of 20 inches from\r\nthe centre, carries a sheet-iron plane (or paddle) 16 inches square,\r\nwhich is inclined so as to form an angle of 60 degrees, both with the\r\narbor and keel of the vessel, to which the arbor is placed parallel.\r\nTo sustain this arbor and the wheels, two strong bars of iron, between\r\n2 and 3 inches thick, proceed from the side of the vessel at right\r\nangles to it, about 2-1/2 feet below the surface of the water.\" He\r\nproposed similar screw-propellers at the stern, and suggested that\r\nthey could be driven by animal or by steam-power.\r\n\r\nBut a more remarkable essay is quoted by Figuier[61]--the paper of\r\nl'Abbe Gauthier, published in the \"Memoires de la Societe Royale des\r\nSciences et Lettres de Nancy.\" Bernouilli had expressed the belief\r\nthat the best steam-engine then known--that of Newcomen--was not\r\nsuperior to some other motors. Gauthier proposed to use that engine in\r\nthe propulsion of paddle-wheels placed at the side of the vessel. His\r\nplan was not brought into use, but his paper embodied a glowing\r\ndescription of the advantages to be secured by its adoption. He states\r\nthat a galley urged by 26 oars on a side made but 4,320 toises (8,420\r\nmeters), or about 5 miles, an hour, and required a crew of 260 men. A\r\nsteam-engine, doing the same work, would be ready for action at all\r\ntimes, could be applied, when not driving the vessel, to raising the\r\nanchor, working the pumps, and to ventilating the ship, while the fire\r\nwould also serve to cook with. The engine would occupy less space and\r\nweight than the men, would require less aliment, and that of a less\r\nexpensive kind, etc. He would make the boiler safe against explosions\r\nby bands of iron; would make the fire-box of iron, with a water-filled\r\nash-pit and base-plate. His injection-water was to come from the sea,\r\nand return by a delivery-pipe placed above the water-line. The chains,\r\nusually leading from the end of the beam to the pump-rods, were to be\r\ncarried around wheels on the paddle-shaft, which were to be provided\r\nwith pawls entering a ratchet, and thus the paddles, having been given\r\nseveral revolutions by the descent of the piston and the unwinding of\r\nthe chain, were to revolve freely while the return-stroke was made,\r\nthe chain being hauled down and rewound by the wheel on the shaft, the\r\nlatter being moved by a weight. The engine was proposed to be of 6\r\nfeet stroke, and to make 15 strokes per minute, with a force of 11,000\r\npounds.\r\n\r\n  [61] \"Les Merveilles de la Science.\"\r\n\r\nA little later (1760), a Swiss clergyman, J. A. Genevois, published\r\nin London a paper relating to the improvement of navigation,[62] in\r\nwhich his plan was proposed of compressing springs by steam or other\r\npower, and applying their effort while recovering their form to\r\nship-propulsion.\r\n\r\n  [62] \"Some New Enquiries tending to the Improvement of Navigation.\"\r\n  London, 1760.\r\n\r\nIt was at this time that the first attempts were made in the United\r\nStates to solve this problem, which had begun to be recognized as one\r\nof the greatest which had presented itself to the mechanic and the\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\nWILLIAM HENRY was a prominent citizen of the then little village of\r\nLancaster, Pa., and was noted as an ingenious and successful\r\nmechanic.[63] He was still living at the beginning of the present\r\ncentury. Mr. Henry was the first to make the \"rag\" carpet, and was the\r\ninventor of the screw-auger. He was of a Scotch and North-of-Ireland\r\nfamily, his father, John Henry, and his two older brothers, Robert and\r\nJames, having come to the United States about 1720. Robert settled,\r\nfinally, in Virginia, and it is said that Patrick Henry, the patriot\r\nand orator, was of his family. The others remained in Chester County,\r\nPa., where William was born, in 1729. He learned the trade of a\r\ngunsmith, and, driven from his home during the Indian war (1755 to\r\n1760), settled in Lancaster.\r\n\r\n  [63] _Lancaster Daily Express_, December 10, 1872. This account is\r\n  collated from various manuscripts and letters in the possession of\r\n  the author.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1760 he went to England on business, where his attention\r\nwas attracted to the invention--then new, and the subject of\r\ndiscussion in every circle--of James Watt. He saw the possibility of\r\nits application to navigation and to driving carriages, and, on his\r\nreturn home, commenced the construction of a steam-engine, and\r\nfinished it in 1763.\r\n\r\nPlacing it in a boat fitted with paddle-wheels, he made a trial of the\r\nnew machine on the Conestoga River, near Lancaster, where the craft,\r\nby some accident, sank,[64] and was lost. He was not discouraged by\r\nthis failure, but made a second model, adding some improvements. Among\r\nthe records of the Pennsylvania Philosophical Society is, or was, a\r\ndesign, presented by Henry in 1782, of one of his steamboats. The\r\nGerman traveler Schoepff visited the United States in 1783, and at Mr.\r\nHenry's house, at Lancaster, was shown \"a machine by Mr. Henry,\r\nintended for the propelling of boats, etc.; 'but,' said Mr. Henry, 'I\r\nam doubtful whether such a machine would find favor with the public,\r\nas every one considers it impracticable against wind and tide;' but\r\nthat such a Boat _will_ come into use and navigate on the waters of\r\nthe Ohio and Mississippi, he had not the least doubt of, but the time\r\nhad not yet arrived of its being appreciated and applied.\"\r\n\r\n  [64] Bowen's \"Sketches,\" p. 56.\r\n\r\nJohn Fitch, whose experiments will presently be referred to, was an\r\nacquaintance and frequent visitor to the house of Mr. Henry, and may\r\nprobably have there received the earliest suggestions of the\r\nimportance of this application of steam. About 1777, when Henry was\r\nengaged in making mathematical and philosophical instruments, and the\r\nscrew-auger, which at that time could only be obtained of him, Robert\r\nFulton, then twelve years old, visited him, to study the paintings of\r\nBenjamin West, who had long been a friend and protege of Henry. He,\r\ntoo, not improbably received there the first suggestion which\r\nafterward led him to desert the art to which he at first devoted\r\nhimself, and which made of the young portrait-painter a successful\r\ninventor and engineer. West's acquaintance with Henry had no such\r\nresult. The young painter was led by his patron and friend to attempt\r\nhistorical pictures,[65] and probably owes his fame greatly to the\r\nkindly and discerning mechanic. Says Galt, in his \"Memoirs of Sir\r\nBenjamin West\" (London, 1816): \"Towards his old friend, William Henry,\r\nof Lancaster City, he always cherished the most grateful affection;\r\nhe was the first who urged him to attempt historical composition.\"\r\n\r\n  [65] Some of West's portraits, including those of Mr. and Mrs.\r\n  Henry, were lately in the possession of Mr. John Jordan, of\r\n  Philadelphia.\r\n\r\nWhen, after the invention of Watt, the steam-engine had taken such\r\nshape that it could really work the propelling apparatus of a paddle\r\nor screw vessel, a new impetus was given to the work of its\r\nadaptation. In France, the Marquis de Jouffroy was one of the earliest\r\nto perceive that the improvements of Watt, rendering the engine more\r\ncompact, more powerful, and, at the same time, more regular and\r\npositive in its action, had made it, at last, readily applicable to\r\nthe propulsion of vessels. The brothers Perier had imported a Watt\r\nengine from Soho, and this was attentively studied by the marquis,[66]\r\nand its application to the paddle-wheels of a steam-vessel seemed to\r\nhim a simple problem. Comte d'Auxiron and Chevalier Charles Mounin, of\r\nFollenai, friends and companions of Jouffroy, were similarly\r\ninterested, and the three are said to have often discussed the scheme\r\ntogether, and to have united in devising methods of applying the new\r\nmotor.\r\n\r\n  [66] Figuier.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1770, D'Auxiron determined to attempt the realization of\r\nthe plans which he had conceived. He resigned his position in the\r\narmy, prepared his plans and drawings, and presented them to M.\r\nBertin, the Prime Minister, in the year 1771 or 1772. The Minister was\r\nfavorably impressed, and the King (May 22, 1772) granted D'Auxiron a\r\nmonopoly of the use of steam in river-navigation for 15 years,\r\nprovided he should prove his plans practicable, and they should be so\r\nadjudged by the Academy.\r\n\r\nA company had been formed, the day previous, consisting of D'Auxiron,\r\nJouffroy, Comte de Dijon, the Marquis d'Yonne, and Follenai, which\r\nadvanced the requisite funds. The first vessel was commenced in\r\nDecember, 1772. When nearly completed, in September, 1774, the boat\r\nsprung a leak, and, one night, foundered at the wharf. After some\r\nangry discussion, during which D'Auxiron was rudely, and probably\r\nunjustly, accused of bad faith, the company declined to advance the\r\nmoney needed to recover and complete the vessel. They were, however,\r\ncompelled by the court to furnish it; but, meantime, D'Auxiron died of\r\napoplexy, the matter dropped, and the company dissolved. The cost of\r\nthe experiment had been something more than 15,000 francs.\r\n\r\nThe heirs of D'Auxiron turned the papers of the deceased inventor over\r\nto Jouffroy, and the King transferred to him the monopoly held by the\r\nformer. Follenai retained all his interest in the project, and the two\r\nfriends soon enlisted a powerful adherent and patron, the Marquis\r\nDucrest, a well-known soldier, courtier, and member of the Academy,\r\nwho took an active part in the prosecution of the scheme. M. Jacques\r\nPerier, the then distinguished mechanic, was consulted, and prepared\r\nplans, which were adopted in place of those of Jouffroy. The boat was\r\nbuilt by Perier, and a trial took place in 1774, on the Seine. The\r\nresult was unsatisfactory. The little craft could hardly stem the\r\nsluggish current of the river, and the failure caused the immediate\r\nabandonment of the scheme by Perier.\r\n\r\nStill undiscouraged, Jouffroy retired to his country home, at\r\nBaume-les-Dames, on the river Doubs. There he carried on his\r\nexperiments, getting his work done as best he could, with the rude\r\ntools and insufficient apparatus of a village blacksmith. A Watt\r\nengine and a chain carrying \"duck-foot\" paddles were his propelling\r\napparatus. The boat, which was about 14 feet long and 6 wide, was\r\nstarted in June, 1776. The duck's-foot system of paddles proved\r\nunsatisfactory, and Jouffroy gave it up, and renewed his experiments\r\nwith a new arrangement. He placed on the paddle-wheel shaft a\r\nratchet-wheel, and on the piston-rod of his engine, which was placed\r\nhorizontally in the boat, a double rack, into the upper and the lower\r\nparts of which the ratchet-wheel geared. Thus the wheels turned in\r\nthe same direction, whichever way the piston was moving. The new\r\nengine was built at Lyons in 1780, by Messrs. Freres-Jean. The new\r\nboat was about 140 feet long and 14 feet wide; the wheels were 14 feet\r\nin diameter, their floats 6 feet long, and the \"dip,\" or depth to\r\nwhich they reached, was about 2 feet. The boat drew 3 feet of water,\r\nand had a total weight of about 150 tons.\r\n\r\nAt a public trial of the vessel at Lyons, July 15, 1783, the little\r\nsteamer was so successful as to justify the publication of the fact by\r\na report and a proclamation. The fact that the experiment was not made\r\nat Paris was made an excuse on the part of the Academy for withholding\r\nits indorsement, and on the part of the Government for declining to\r\nconfirm to Jouffroy the guaranteed monopoly. Impoverished and\r\ndiscouraged, Jouffroy gave up all hope of prosecuting his plans\r\nsuccessfully, and reentered the army. Thus France lost an honor which\r\nwas already within her grasp, as she had already lost that of the\r\nintroduction of the steam-engine, in the time of Papin.\r\n\r\nAbout 1785, John Fitch and James Rumsey were engaged in experiments\r\nhaving in view the application of steam to navigation.\r\n\r\nRumsey's experiments began in 1774, and in 1786 he succeeded in\r\ndriving a boat at the rate of four miles an hour against the current\r\nof the Potomac at Shepherdstown, W. Va., in presence of General\r\nWashington. His method of propulsion has often been reinvented since,\r\nand its adoption urged with that enthusiasm and persistence which is a\r\npeculiar characteristic of inventors.\r\n\r\nRumsey employed his engine to drive a great pump which forced a stream\r\nof water aft, thus propelling the boat forward, as proposed earlier by\r\nBernouilli. This same method has been recently tried again by the\r\nBritish Admiralty, in a gunboat of moderate size, using a centrifugal\r\npump to set in motion the propelling stream, and with some other\r\nmodifications which are decided improvements upon Rumsey's rude\r\narrangements, but which have not done much more than his toward the\r\nintroduction of \"Hydraulic or Jet Propulsion,\" as it is now called.\r\n\r\nIn 1787 he obtained a patent from the State of Virginia for\r\nsteam-navigation. He wrote a treatise \"On the Application of Steam,\"\r\nwhich was printed at Philadelphia, where a Rumsey society was\r\norganized for the encouragement of attempts at steam-navigation.\r\n\r\nRumsey died of apoplexy, while explaining some of his schemes before a\r\nLondon society a short time later, December 23, 1793, at the age of\r\nfifty years. A boat, then in process of construction from his plans,\r\nwas afterward tried on the Thames, in 1793, and steamed at the rate of\r\nfour miles an hour. The State of Kentucky, in 1839, presented his son\r\nwith a gold medal, commemorative of his father's services \"in giving\r\nto the world the benefit of the steamboat.\"\r\n\r\nJOHN FITCH was an unfortunate and eccentric, but very ingenious,\r\nConnecticut mechanic. After roaming about until forty years of age, he\r\nfinally settled on the banks of the Delaware, where he built his first\r\nsteamboat.\r\n\r\nIn April, 1785, as Fitch himself states, at Neshamony, Bucks County,\r\nPa., he suddenly conceived the idea that a carriage might be driven by\r\nsteam. After considering the subject a few days, his attention was led\r\nto the plan of using steam to propel vessels, and from that time to\r\nthe day of his death he was a persistent advocate of the introduction\r\nof the steamboat. At this time, Fitch says, \"I did not know that there\r\nwas a steam-engine on the earth;\" and he was somewhat disappointed\r\nwhen his friend, the Rev. Mr. Irwin, of Neshamony, showed him a sketch\r\nof one in \"Martin's Philosophy.\"\r\n\r\nFitch's first model was at once built, and was soon after tried on a\r\nsmall stream near Davisville. The machinery was made of brass, and the\r\nboat was impelled by paddle-wheels. A rough model of his steamboat was\r\nshown to Dr. John Ewing, Provost of the University of Pennsylvania,\r\nwho, August 20, 1785, addressed a commendatory letter to an ex-Member\r\nof Congress, William C. Houston, asking him to assist Fitch in\r\nsecuring the aid of the General Government. The latter referred the\r\ninventor, by a letter of recommendation, to a delegate from New\r\nJersey, Mr. Lambert Cadwalader. With this, and other letters, Fitch\r\nproceeded to New York, where Congress then met, and made his\r\napplication in proper form. He was unsuccessful, and equally so in\r\nattempting to secure aid from the Spanish minister, who desired that\r\nthe profits should be secured, by a monopoly of the invention, to the\r\nKing of Spain. Fitch declined further negotiation, determined that, if\r\nsuccessful at all, the benefit should accrue to his own countrymen.\r\n\r\nIn September, 1785, Fitch presented to the American Philosophical\r\nSociety, at Philadelphia, a model in which he had substituted an\r\nendless chain and floats for the paddle-wheels, with drawings and a\r\ndescriptive account of his scheme. This model is shown in the\r\naccompanying figure.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 67.--Fitch's Model, 1785.]\r\n\r\nIn March, 1786, Fitch was granted a patent by the State of New Jersey,\r\nfor the exclusive right to the navigation of the waters of the State\r\nby steam, for 14 years. A month later, he was in Philadelphia, seeking\r\na similar patent from the State of Pennsylvania. He did not at once\r\nsucceed, but in a few days he had formed a company, raised $300, and\r\nset about finding a place in which to construct his engine. Henry\r\nVoight, a Dutch watchmaker, a good mechanic, and a very ingenious man,\r\ntook an interest in the company, and with him Fitch set about his\r\nwork with great enthusiasm. After making a little model, having a\r\nsteam-cylinder but one inch in diameter, they built a model boat and\r\nengine, the latter having a diameter of cylinder of three inches. They\r\ntried the endless chain, and other methods of propulsion, without\r\nsuccess, and finally succeeded with a set of oars worked by the\r\nengine. In August, 1786, it was determined by the company to authorize\r\nthe construction of a larger vessel; but the money was not readily\r\nobtained. Meantime, Fitch continued his efforts to secure a patent\r\nfrom the State, and was finally, March 28, 1787, successful. He also\r\nobtained a similar grant from the State of Delaware, in February of\r\nthe same year, and from New York, March 19.\r\n\r\nMoney was now subscribed more freely, and the work on the boat\r\ncontinued uninterruptedly until May, 1787, when a trial was made,\r\nwhich revealed many defects in the machinery. The cylinder-heads were\r\nof wood, and leaked badly; the piston leaked; the condenser was\r\nimperfect; the valves were not tight. All these defects were remedied,\r\nand a condenser invented by Voight--the \"pipe-condenser\"--was\r\nsubstituted for that defective detail as previously made.\r\n\r\nThe steamboat was finally placed in working order, and was found\r\ncapable, on trial, of making three or four miles an hour. But now the\r\nboiler proved to be too small to furnish steam steadily in sufficient\r\nquantity to sustain the higher speed. After some delay, and much\r\ndistress on the part of the sanguine inventor, who feared that he\r\nmight be at last defeated when on the very verge of success, the\r\nnecessary changes were finally made, and a trial took place at\r\nPhiladelphia, in presence of the members of the Convention--then in\r\nsession at Philadelphia framing the Federal Constitution--August 22,\r\n1787. Many of the distinguished spectators gave letters to Fitch\r\ncertifying his success. Fitch now went to Virginia, where he succeeded\r\nin obtaining a patent, November 7, 1787, and then returned to ask a\r\npatent of the General Government.\r\n\r\nA controversy with Rumsey now followed, in which Fitch asserted his\r\nclaims to the invention of the steamboat, and denied that Rumsey had\r\ndone more than to revive the scheme which Bernouilli, Franklin, Henry,\r\nPaine, and others, had previously proposed, and that Rumsey's\r\n_steamboat_ was not made until 1786.\r\n\r\nThe boiler adopted in Fitch's boat of 1787 was a \"pipe-boiler,\" which\r\nhe had described in a communication to the Philosophical Society, in\r\nSeptember, 1785. It consisted (Fig. 68) of a small water-pipe, winding\r\nbackward and forward in the furnace, and terminating at one end at the\r\npoint at which the feed-water was introduced, and at the other uniting\r\nwith the steam-pipe leading to the engine. Voight's condenser was\r\nsimilarly constructed. Rumsey claimed that this boiler was copied from\r\nhis designs. Fitch brought evidence to prove that Rumsey had not built\r\nsuch a boiler until after his own.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 68.--Fitch and Voight's Boiler, 1787.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 69.--Fitch's First Boat, 1787.]\r\n\r\nFitch's first boat-engine had a steam-cylinder 12 inches in diameter.\r\nA second engine was now built (1788) with a cylinder 18 inches in\r\ndiameter, and a new boat. The first vessel was 45 feet long and 12\r\nfeet wide; the new boat was 60 feet long and of but 8 feet breadth of\r\nbeam. The first boat (Fig. 69) had paddles worked at the sides, with\r\nthe motion given the Indian paddle in propelling a canoe; in the\r\nsecond boat (Fig. 70) they were similarly worked, but were placed at\r\nthe stern. There were three of these paddles. The boat was finally\r\nfinished in July, 1788, and made a trip to Burlington, 20 miles from\r\nPhiladelphia. When just reaching their destination, their boiler gave\r\nout, and they made their return-trip to Philadelphia floating with the\r\ntide. Subsequently, the boat made a number of excursions on the\r\nDelaware River, making three or four miles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 70.--John Fitch, 1788.]\r\n\r\nAnother of Fitch's boats, in April, 1790, made seven miles an hour.\r\nFitch, writing of this boat, says that \"on the 16th of April we got\r\nour work completed, and tried our boat again; and, although the wind\r\nblew very fresh at the east, we reigned lord high admirals of the\r\nDelaware, and no boat on the river could hold way with us.\" In June\r\nof that year it was placed as a passenger-boat on a line from\r\nPhiladelphia to Burlington, Bristol, Bordentown, and Trenton,\r\noccasionally leaving that route to take excursions to Wilmington and\r\nChester. During this period, the boat probably ran between 2,000 and\r\n3,000 miles,[67] and with no serious accident. During the winter of\r\n1790-'91, Fitch commenced another steamboat, the \"Perseverance,\" and\r\ngave considerable time to the prosecution of his claim for a patent\r\nfrom the United States. The boat was never completed, although he\r\nreceived his patent, after a long and spirited contest with other\r\nclaimants, on the 26th of August, 1791, and Fitch lost all hope of\r\nsuccess. He went to France in 1793, hoping to obtain the privilege of\r\nbuilding steam-vessels there, but was again disappointed, and worked\r\nhis passage home in the following year.\r\n\r\n  [67] \"Life of John Fitch,\" Westcott.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 71.--John Fitch, 1796.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1796, Fitch was again in New York City, experimenting with\r\na little _screw_ steamboat on the \"Collect\" Pond, which then covered\r\nthat part of the city now occupied by the \"Tombs,\" the city prison.\r\nThis little boat was a ship's yawl fitted with a screw, like that\r\nadopted later by Woodcroft, and driven by a rudely-made engine.\r\n\r\nFitch, while in the city of Philadelphia at about this time, met\r\nOliver Evans, and discussed with him the probable future of\r\nsteam-navigation, and proposed to form a company in the West, to\r\npromote the introduction of steam on the great rivers of that part of\r\nthe country. He settled at last in Kentucky, on his land-grant, and\r\nthere amused himself with a model steamboat, which he placed in a\r\nsmall stream near Bardstown. His death occurred there in July, 1798,\r\nand his body still lies in the village cemetery, with only a rough\r\nstone to mark the spot.\r\n\r\nBoth Rumsey and Fitch endeavored to introduce their methods in Great\r\nBritain; and Fitch, while urging the importance and the advantages of\r\nhis plan, confidently stated his belief that the ocean would soon be\r\ncrossed by steam-vessels, and that the navigation of the Mississippi\r\nwould also become exclusively a steam-navigation. His reiterated\r\nassertion, \"The day will come when some more powerful man will get\r\nfame and riches from my invention; but no one will believe that poor\r\nJohn Fitch can do anything worthy of attention,\" now almost sounds\r\nlike a prophecy.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, an interest which had never diminished in Great\r\nBritain had led to the introduction of experimental steamboats in that\r\ncountry. PATRICK MILLER, of Dalswinton, had commenced experimenting,\r\nin 1786-'87, with boats having double or triple hulls, and propelled\r\nby paddle-wheels placed between the parts of the compound vessel.\r\nJames Taylor, a young man who had been engaged as tutor for Mr.\r\nMiller's sons, suggested, in 1787, the substitution of steam for the\r\nmanual power which had been, up to that time, relied upon in their\r\npropulsion. Mr. Miller, in 1787, printed a description of his plan of\r\npropelling apparatus, and in it stated that he had \"reason to believe\r\nthat the power of the Steam-Engine may be applied to work the wheels.\"\r\n\r\nIn the winter of 1787-'88, William Symmington, who had planned a new\r\nform of steam-engine, and made a successful working-model, was\r\nemployed by Mr. Miller to construct an engine for a new boat. This was\r\nbuilt; the little engine, having two cylinders of but four inches in\r\ndiameter, was placed on board, and a trial was made October 14, 1788.\r\nThe vessel (Fig. 72) was 25 feet long, of 7 feet beam, and made 5\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 72.--Miller, Taylor, and Symmington, 1788.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1789, a large vessel was built, with an engine having a\r\nsteam-cylinder 18 inches in diameter, and this vessel was ready for\r\ntrial in November of that year. On the first trial, the paddle-wheels\r\nproved too slight, and broke down; they were replaced by stronger\r\nwheels, and, in December, the boat, on trial, made seven miles an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\nMiller, like many other inventors, seems to have lost his interest in\r\nthe matter as soon as success seemed assured, and dropped it to take\r\nup other incomplete plans. More than a quarter of a century later, the\r\nBritish Government gave Taylor a pension of L50 per annum, and, in\r\n1837, his four daughters were each given a similar annuity. Mr.\r\nMiller received no reward, although he is said to have expended over\r\nL30,000. The engine of Symmington was condemned by Miller as \"the most\r\nimproper of all steam-engines for giving motion to a vessel.\" Nothing\r\nmore was done in Great Britain until early in the succeeding century.\r\n\r\nIn the United States, several mechanics were now at work besides\r\nFitch. Samuel Morey and Nathan Read were among these. Nicholas\r\nRoosevelt was another. It had just been found that American mechanics\r\nwere able to do the required shop-work. The first experimental\r\nsteam-engine built in America is stated to have been made in 1773 by\r\nChristopher Colles, a lecturer before the American Philosophical\r\nSociety at Philadelphia. The first steam-cylinder of any considerable\r\nsize is said[68] to have been made by Sharpe & Curtenius, of New York\r\nCity.\r\n\r\n  [68] _Rivington's Gazette_, February 16, 1775.\r\n\r\nSAMUEL MOREY was the son of one of the first settlers of Orford, N. H.\r\nHe was naturally fond of science and mechanics, and became something\r\nof an inventor. He began experimenting with the steamboat in 1790 or\r\nearlier, building a small vessel, and fitting it with paddle-wheels\r\ndriven by a steam-engine of his own design, and constructed by\r\nhimself.[69] He made a trial-trip one Sunday morning in the summer of\r\n1790, a friend to accompany him, from Oxford, up the Connecticut\r\nRiver, to Fairlee, Vt., a distance of several miles, and returned\r\nsafely. He then went to New York, and spent the summer of each year\r\nuntil 1793 in experimenting with his boat and modifications of his\r\nengine. In 1793 he made a trip to Hartford, returning to New York the\r\nnext summer. His boat was a \"stern-wheeler,\" and is stated to have\r\nbeen capable of steaming five miles an hour. He next went to\r\nBordentown, N. J., where he built a larger boat, which is said to have\r\nbeen a side-wheel boat, and to have worked satisfactorily. His funds\r\nfinally gave out, and he gave up his project after having, in 1797,\r\nmade a trip to Philadelphia. Fulton, Livingston, and Stevens met Morey\r\nat New York, inspected his boat, and made an excursion to Greenwich\r\nwith him.[70] Livingston is said[71] to have offered to assist Morey\r\nif he should succeed in attaining a speed of eight miles an hour.\r\n\r\n  [69] _Providence Journal_, May 7, 1874. Coll., N. H. Antiquar. Soc.,\r\n  No. 1; \"Who invented the Steamboat?\" William A. Mowry, 1874.\r\n\r\n  [70] Rev. Cyrus Mann, in the _Boston Recorder_, 1858.\r\n\r\n  [71] Westcott.\r\n\r\nMorey's experiments seem to have been conducted very quietly, however,\r\nand almost nothing is known of them. The author has not been able to\r\nlearn any particulars of the engines used by him, and nothing definite\r\nis known of the dimensions of either boat or machinery. Morey never,\r\nlike Fitch and Rumsey, sought publicity for his plans or notoriety for\r\nhimself.\r\n\r\nNATHAN READ, who has already been mentioned, a native of Warren,\r\nMass., where he was born in the year 1759, and a graduate of Harvard\r\nCollege, was a student of medicine, and subsequently a manufacturer of\r\nchain-cables and other iron-work for ships. He invented, and in 1798\r\npatented, a nail-making machine. He was at one time (1800-1803) a\r\nMember of Congress, and, later, a Justice of the Court of Common\r\nPleas, and Chief Justice in Hancock County, Me., after his removal to\r\nthat State in 1807. He died in Belfast, Me., in 1849, at the age of\r\nninety years.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1788 he became interested in the problem of\r\nsteam-navigation, and learned something of the work of Fitch. He first\r\nattempted to design a boiler that should be strong, light, and\r\ncompact, as well as safe. His first plan was that of the \"Portable\r\nFurnace-Boiler,\" as he called it; it was patented August 26, 1791. As\r\ndesigned, it consisted, as seen in Figs. 73 and 74, which are reduced\r\nfrom his patent drawings, of a shell of cylindrical form, like the now\r\ncommon vertical tubular boiler. _A_ is the furnace-door, _B_ a heater\r\nand feed-water reservoir, _D_ a pipe leading the feed-water into the\r\nboiler,[72] _E_ the smoke-pipe, and _F_ the steam-pipe leading to the\r\nengine. _G_ is the \"shell\" of the boiler, and _H_ the fire-box. The\r\ncrown-sheet, _I I_, has depending from it, in the furnace, a set of\r\nwater-tubes, _b b_, closed at their lower ends, and another set, _a\r\na_, which connect the water-space above the furnace with the\r\nwater-bottom, _K K_. _L_ is the furnace, and _M_ the draught-space\r\nbetween the boiler and the ash-pit, in which the grates are set.\r\n\r\n  [72] This is substantially an arrangement that has recently become\r\n  common. It has been repatented by later inventors.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 73.--Read's Boiler in Section, 1788.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 74.--Read's Multi-Tubular Boiler, 1788.]\r\n\r\nThis boiler was intended to be used in both steamboats and\r\nsteam-carriages. The first drawings were made in 1788 or 1789, as were\r\nthose of a peculiar form of steam-engine which also resembled very\r\nclosely that afterward constructed in Great Britain by Trevithick.[73]\r\nHe built a boat in 1789, which he fitted with paddle-wheels and a\r\ncrank, which was turned by hand, and, by trial, satisfied himself that\r\nthe system would work satisfactorily.\r\n\r\n  [73] \"Nathan Read and the Steam-Engine.\"\r\n\r\nHe then applied for his patent, and spent the greater part of the\r\nwinter of 1789-'90 in New York, where Congress then met, endeavoring\r\nto secure it. In January, 1791, Read withdrew his petitions for\r\npatents, proposing to incorporate accounts of new devices, and renewed\r\nthem a few months later. His patents were finally issued, dated August\r\n26, 1791. John Fitch, James Rumsey, and John Stevens, also, all\r\nreceived patents at the same date, for various methods of applying\r\nsteam to the propulsion of vessels.\r\n\r\nRead appears to have never succeeded in even experimentally making his\r\nplans successful. He deserves credit for his early and intelligent\r\nperception of the importance of the subject, and for the ingenuity of\r\nhis devices. As the inventor of the vertical multi-tubular fire-box\r\nboiler, he has also entitled himself to great distinction. This boiler\r\nis now in very general use, and is a standard form.\r\n\r\nIn 1792, Elijah Ormsbee, a Rhode Island mechanic, assisted pecuniarily\r\nby David Wilkinson, built a small steamboat at Winsor's Cove,\r\nNarragansett Bay, and made a successful trial-trip on the Seekonk\r\nRiver. Ormsbee used an \"atmospheric engine\" and \"duck's-foot\" paddles.\r\nHis boat attained a speed of from three to four miles an hour.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, Lord Dundas and William Symmington, the former as\r\nthe purveyor of funds and the latter as engineer, followed by Henry\r\nBell, were the first to make the introduction of the steam-engine for\r\nthe propulsion of ships so completely successful that no interruption\r\nsubsequently took place in the growth of the new system of\r\nwater-transportation.\r\n\r\nThomas, Lord Dundas, of Kerse, had taken great interest in the\r\nexperiments of Miller, and had hoped to be able to apply the new motor\r\non the Forth and Clyde Canal, in which he held a large interest.\r\nAfter the failure of the earlier experiments, he did not forget the\r\nmatter; but subsequently, meeting with Symmington, who had been\r\nMiller's constructing engineer, he engaged him to continue the\r\nexperiments, and furnished all required capital, about L7,000. This\r\nwas ten years after Miller had abandoned his scheme.\r\n\r\nSymmington commenced work in 1801. The first boat built for Lord\r\nDundas, which has been claimed to have been the \"first practical\r\nsteamboat,\" was finished ready for trial early in 1802. The vessel was\r\ncalled the \"Charlotte Dundas,\" in honor of a daughter of Lord Dundas,\r\nwho became Lady Milton.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 75.--The \"Charlotte Dundas,\" 1801.]\r\n\r\nThe vessel (Fig. 75) was driven by a Watt double-acting engine,\r\nturning a crank on the paddle-wheel shaft. The sectional sketch below\r\nexhibits the arrangement of the machinery. _A_ is the steam-cylinder,\r\ndriving, by means of the connecting-rod, _B C_, a stern-wheel, _E E_.\r\n_F_ is the boiler, and _G_ the tall smoke-pipe. An air-pump and\r\ncondenser, _H_, is seen under the steam-cylinder.\r\n\r\nIn March, 1802, the boat was brought to Lock No. 20 on the Forth and\r\nClyde Canal, and two vessels of 70 tons burden each taken in tow. Lord\r\nDundas, William Symmington, and a party of invited guests, were taken\r\non board, and the boat steamed down to Port Glasgow, a distance of\r\nabout 20 miles, against a strong head-wind, in six hours.\r\n\r\nThe proprietors of the canal were now urged to adopt the new plan of\r\ntowing; but, fearing injury to the banks of the canal, they declined\r\nto do so. Lord Dundas then laid the matter before the Duke of\r\nBridgewater, who gave Symmington an order for eight boats like the\r\nCharlotte Dundas, to be used on his canal. The death of the Duke,\r\nhowever, prevented the contract from being carried into effect, and\r\nSymmington again gave up the project in despair. A quarter of a\r\ncentury later, Symmington received from the British Government L100,\r\nand, a little later, L50 additional, as an acknowledgment of his\r\nservices. The Charlotte Dundas was laid up, and we hear nothing more\r\nof that vessel.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 76.--The \"Comet,\" 1812.]\r\n\r\nAmong those who saw the Charlotte Dundas, and who appreciated the\r\nimportance of the success achieved by Symmington, was HENRY BELL, who,\r\n10 years afterward, constructed the Comet (Fig. 76), the first\r\npassenger-vessel built in Europe. This vessel was built in 1811, and\r\ncompleted January 18, 1812. The craft was of 30 tons burden, 40 feet\r\nin length, and 10-1/2 feet breadth of beam. There were _two_\r\npaddle-wheels on each side, driven by engines rated at three\r\nhorse-power.\r\n\r\nBell had, it is said, been an enthusiastic believer in the advantages\r\nto be secured by this application of steam, from about 1786. In 1800,\r\nand again in 1803, he applied to the British Admiralty for aid in\r\nsecuring those advantages by experimentally determining the proper\r\nform and proportions of machinery and vessel; but was not able to\r\nconvince the Admiralty of \"the practicability and great utility of\r\napplying steam to the propelling of vessels against winds and tides,\r\nand every obstruction on rivers and seas where there was depth of\r\nwater.\" He also wrote to the United States Government, urging his\r\nviews in a similar strain.\r\n\r\nBell's boat was, when finished, advertised as a passenger-boat, to\r\nleave Greenock, where the vessel was built, on Mondays, Wednesdays,\r\nand Fridays, for Glasgow, 24 miles distant, returning Tuesdays,\r\nThursdays, and Saturdays. The fare was made \"four shillings for the\r\nbest cabin, and three shillings for the second.\" It was some months\r\nbefore the vessel became considered a trustworthy means of conveyance.\r\nBell, on the whole, was at first a heavy loser by his venture,\r\nalthough his boat proved itself a safe, stanch vessel.\r\n\r\nBell constructed several other boats in 1815, and with his success\r\nsteam-navigation in Great Britain was fairly inaugurated. In 1814\r\nthere were five steamers, all Scotch, regularly working in British\r\nwaters; in 1820 there were 34, one-half of which were in England, 14\r\nin Scotland, and the remainder in Ireland. Twenty years later, at the\r\nclose of the period to which this chapter is especially devoted, there\r\nwere about 1,325 steam-vessels in that kingdom, of which 1,000 were\r\nEnglish and 250 Scotch.\r\n\r\nBut we must return to America, to witness the first and most complete\r\nsuccess, commercially, in the introduction of the steamboat.\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. Stevens, Livingston, Fulton, and Roosevelt were there the\r\nmost successful pioneers. The latter is said to have built the\r\n\"Polacca,\" a small steamboat launched on the Passaic River in 1798.\r\nThe vessel was 60 feet long, and had an engine of 20 inches diameter\r\nof cylinder and 2 feet stroke, which drove the boat 8 miles an hour,\r\ncarrying a party of invited guests, which included the Spanish\r\nMinister. Livingston and John Stevens had induced Roosevelt to try\r\ntheir plans still earlier,[74] paying the expense of the experiments.\r\nThe former adopted the plan of Bernouilli and Rumsey, using a\r\ncentrifugal pump to force a jet of water from the stern; the latter\r\nused the screw. Livingston going to France as United States Minister,\r\nBarlow carried over the plans of the \"Polacca,\" and Roosevelt's\r\nfriends state that a boat built by them, in conjunction with Fulton,\r\nwas a \"sister-ship\" to that vessel. In 1798, Roosevelt patented a\r\ndouble engine, having cranks set at right angles. As late as 1814 he\r\nreceived a patent for a steam-vessel, fitted with paddle-wheels having\r\nadjustable floats. His boat of 1798 is stated by some writers to have\r\nbeen made by him on joint account of himself, Livingston, and Stevens.\r\nRoosevelt, some years later, was again at work, associating himself\r\nwith Fulton in the introduction of steam-navigation of the rivers of\r\nthe West.[75]\r\n\r\n  [74] \"Encyclopaedia Americana.\"\r\n\r\n  [75] \"A Lost Chapter in the History of the Steamboat,\" J. H. B.\r\n  Latrobe, 1871.\r\n\r\nIn 1798, the Legislature of New York passed a law giving Chancellor\r\nLivingston the exclusive right to steam-navigation in the waters of\r\nthe State for a period of 20 years, _provided_ that he should succeed,\r\nwithin a twelve-month, in producing a boat that should steam four\r\nmiles an hour.\r\n\r\nLivingston did not succeed in complying with the terms of the act,\r\nbut, in 1803, he procured the reenactment of the law in favor of\r\nhimself and Robert Fulton, who was then experimenting in France, after\r\nhaving, in England, watched the progress of steam-navigation there,\r\nand then taken a patent in this country.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Robert Fulton.]\r\n\r\nROBERT FULTON was a native of Little Britain, Lancaster County, Pa.,\r\nborn 1765. He commenced experimenting with paddle-wheels when a mere\r\nboy, in 1779, visiting an aunt living on the bank of the\r\nConestoga.[76] During his youth he spent much of his time in the\r\nworkshops of his neighborhood, and learned the trade of a watchmaker;\r\nbut he adopted, finally, the profession of an artist, and exhibited\r\ngreat skill in portrait-painting. While his tastes were at this time\r\ntaking a decided bent, he is said to have visited frequently the house\r\nof William Henry, already mentioned, to see the paintings of Benjamin\r\nWest, who in his youth had been a kind of protege of Mr. Henry; and he\r\nmay probably have seen there the model steamboats which Mr. Henry\r\nexhibited, in 1783 or 1784, to the German traveler Schoepff. In later\r\nyears, Thomas Paine, the author of \"Common Sense,\" at one time lived\r\nwith Mr. Henry, and afterward, in 1788, proposed that Congress take up\r\nthe subject for the benefit of the country.\r\n\r\n  [76] _Vide_ \"Life of Fulton,\" Reigart.\r\n\r\nFulton went to England when he came of age, and studied painting with\r\nBenjamin West. He afterward spent two years in Devonshire, where he\r\nmet the Duke of Bridgewater, who afterward so promptly took advantage\r\nof the success of the \"Charlotte Dundas.\"\r\n\r\nWhile in England and in France--where he went in 1797, and resided\r\nsome time--he may have seen something of the attempts which were\r\nbeginning to be made to introduce steam-navigation in both of those\r\ncountries.\r\n\r\nAt about this time--perhaps in 1793--Fulton gave up painting as a\r\nprofession, and became a civil engineer. In 1797 he went to Paris, and\r\ncommenced experimenting with submarine torpedoes and torpedo-boats. In\r\n1801 he had succeeded so well with them as to create much anxiety in\r\nthe minds of the English, then at war with France.\r\n\r\nHe had, as early as 1793, proposed plans for steam-vessels, both to\r\nthe United States and the British Governments, and seems never\r\nentirely to have lost sight of the subject.[77] While in France he\r\nlived with Joel Barlow, who subsequently became known as a poet, and\r\nas Embassador to France from the United States, but who was then\r\nengaged in business in Paris.\r\n\r\n  [77] _Vide_ \"Life of Fulton,\" Colden.\r\n\r\nWhen about leaving the country, Fulton met Robert Livingston\r\n(Chancellor Livingston, as he is often called), who was then (1801)\r\nEmbassador of the United States at the court of France. Together they\r\ndiscussed the project of applying steam to navigation, and determined\r\nto attempt the construction of a steamboat on the Seine; and in the\r\nearly spring of the year 1802, Fulton having attended Mrs. Barlow to\r\nPlombieres, where she had been sent by her physician, he there made\r\ndrawings and models, which were sent or described to Livingston. In\r\nthe following winter Fulton completed a model side-wheel boat.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 77.--Fulton's Experiments.]\r\n\r\nJanuary 24, 1803, he delivered this model to MM. Molar, Bordel, and\r\nMontgolfier, with a descriptive memoir, in which he stated that he\r\nhad, by experiment, proven that side-wheels were better than the\r\n\"chaplet\" (paddle-floats set on an endless chain).[78] These gentlemen\r\nwere then building for Fulton and Livingston their first boat, on\r\nL'Isle des Cygnes, in the Seine. In planning this boat, Fulton had\r\ndevised many different methods of applying steam to its propulsion,\r\nand had made some experiments to determine the resistance of fluids.\r\nHe therefore had been able to calculate, more accurately than had any\r\nearlier inventor, the relative size and proportions of boat and\r\nmachinery.\r\n\r\n  [78] A French inventor, a watchmaker of Trevoux, named Desblancs,\r\n  had already deposited at the Conservatoire a model fitted with\r\n  \"chaplets.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 78.--Fulton's Table of Resistances.]\r\n\r\nThe author has examined a large collection of Fulton's drawings, among\r\nwhich are sketches, very neatly executed, of many of these plans,\r\nincluding the chaplet, side-wheel, and stern-wheel boats, driven by\r\nvarious forms of steam-engine, some working direct, and some geared to\r\nthe paddle-wheel shaft. Figs. 77 and 78 are engraved from two of these\r\nsheets. The first represents the method adopted by Fulton to determine\r\nthe resistance of masses of wood of various forms and proportions,\r\nwhen towed through water. The other is \"A Table of the resistance of\r\nbodies moved through water, taken from experiments made in England by\r\na society for improving Naval architecture, between the years 1793 and\r\n1798\" (Fig. 78). This latter is from a certified copy of \"The Original\r\nDrawing on file in the Office of the Clerk of the New York District,\r\nmaking a part of the Demonstration of the patent granted to Robert\r\nFulton, Esqr., on the 11th day of February, 1809. Dated this 3rd\r\nMarch, 1814,\" and is signed by Theron Rudd, Clerk of the New York\r\nDistrict. Resistances are given in pounds per square foot.\r\n\r\nGuided by these experiments and calculations, therefore, Fulton\r\ndirected the construction of his vessel. It was completed in the\r\nspring of 1803. But, unfortunately, the hull of the little vessel was\r\ntoo weak for its heavy machinery, and it broke in two and sank to the\r\nbottom of the Seine. Undiscouraged, Fulton at once set about repairing\r\ndamages. He was compelled to direct the rebuilding of the hull. The\r\nmachinery was little injured. In June, 1803, the reconstruction was\r\ncompleted, and the vessel was set afloat in July. The hull was 66 feet\r\nlong, of 8 feet beam, and of light draught.\r\n\r\nAugust 9, 1803, this boat was cast loose, and steamed up the Seine, in\r\npresence of an immense concourse of spectators. A committee of the\r\nNational Academy, consisting of Bougainville, Bossuet, Carnot, and\r\nPerier, were present to witness the experiment. The boat moved but\r\nslowly, making only between 3 and 4 miles an hour against the current,\r\nthe speed through the water being about 4-1/2 miles; but this was, all\r\nthings considered, a great success.\r\n\r\nThe experiment was successful, but it attracted little attention,\r\nnotwithstanding the fact that its success had been witnessed by the\r\ncommittee of the Academy and by many well-known savants and mechanics,\r\nand by officers on Napoleon's staff. The boat remained a long time on\r\nthe Seine, near the palace. The water-tube boiler of this vessel (Fig.\r\n79) is still preserved at the Conservatoire des Arts et Metiers at\r\nParis, where it is known as Barlow's boiler. Barlow patented it in\r\nFrance as early as 1793, as a steamboat-boiler, and states that the\r\nobject of his construction was to obtain the greatest possible extent\r\nof heating-surface.\r\n\r\nFulton endeavored to secure the pecuniary aid and the countenance of\r\nthe First Consul, but in vain.\r\n\r\nLivingston wrote home, describing the trial of this steamboat and its\r\nresults, and procured the passage of an act by the Legislature of the\r\nState of New York, extending a monopoly granted him in 1798 for the\r\nterm of 20 years from April 5, 1803, the date of the new law, and\r\nextending the time allowed for proving the practicability of driving a\r\nboat four miles an hour by steam to two years from the same date. A\r\nlater act further extended the time to April, 1807.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 79.--Barlow's Water-Tube Boiler, 1793.]\r\n\r\nIn May, 1804, Fulton went to England, giving up all hope of success in\r\nFrance with either his steamboats or his torpedoes. Fulton had already\r\nwritten to Boulton & Watt, ordering an engine to be built from plans\r\nwhich he furnished them; but he had not informed them of the purpose\r\nto which it was to be applied. This engine was to have a\r\nsteam-cylinder 2 feet in diameter and of 4 feet stroke. The engine of\r\nthe Charlotte Dundas was of very nearly the same size; and this fact,\r\nand the visit of Fulton to Symmington in 1801, as described by the\r\nlatter, have been made the basis of a claim that Fulton was a copyist\r\nof the plans of others. The general accordance of the dimensions of\r\nhis boat on the Seine with those of the \"Polacca\" of Roosevelt is also\r\nmade the basis of similar claims by the friends of the latter. It\r\nwould appear, however, that Symmington's statement is incorrect, as\r\nFulton was in France, experimenting with torpedoes, at the time (July,\r\n1801[79]) when he is accused of having obtained from the English\r\nengineer the dimensions and a statement of the performance of his\r\nvessel. Yet a fireman employed by Symmington has made an affidavit to\r\nthe same statement. It is evident, however, from what has preceded,\r\nthat those inventors and builders who were at that time working with\r\nthe object of introducing the steamboat were usually well acquainted\r\nwith what had been done by others, and with what was being done by\r\ntheir contemporaries; and it is undoubtedly the fact that each\r\nprofited, so far as he was able, by the experience of others.\r\n\r\n  [79] Woodcroft, p. 64.\r\n\r\nWhile in England, however, Fulton was certainly not so entirely\r\nabsorbed in the torpedo experiments with which he was occupied in the\r\nyears 1804-'6 as to forget his plans for a steamboat; and he saw the\r\nengine ordered by him in 1804 completed in the latter year, and\r\npreceded it to New York, sailing from Falmouth in October, 1806, and\r\nreaching the United States December 13, 1806.\r\n\r\nThe engine was soon received, and Fulton immediately contracted for a\r\nhull in which to set it up. Meantime, Livingston had also returned to\r\nthe United States, and the two enthusiasts worked together on a larger\r\nsteamer than any which had yet been constructed.\r\n\r\nIn the spring of 1807, the \"Clermont\" (Fig. 80), as the new boat was\r\nchristened, was launched from the ship-yard of Charles Brown, on the\r\nEast River, New York. In August the machinery was on board and in\r\nsuccessful operation. The hull of this boat was 133 feet long, 18\r\nwide, and 9 deep. The boat soon made a trip to Albany, running the\r\ndistance of 150 miles in 32 hours running time, and returning in 30\r\nhours. The sails were not used on either occasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 80.--The Clermont, 1807.]\r\n\r\nThis was the first voyage of considerable length ever made by a\r\nsteam-vessel; and Fulton, though not to be classed with James Watt as\r\nan inventor, is entitled to the great honor of having been the first\r\nto make steam-navigation an every-day commercial success, and of\r\nhaving thus made the first application of the steam-engine to\r\nship-propulsion, which was not followed by the retirement of the\r\nexperimenter from the field of his labors before success was\r\npermanently insured.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 81.--Engine of the Clermont, 1808.]\r\n\r\nThe engine of the Clermont (Fig. 81) was of rather peculiar form, the\r\npiston, _E_, being coupled to the crank-shaft, _O_, by a bell-crank,\r\n_I H P_, and a connecting-rod, _P Q_, the paddle-wheel shaft, _M N_,\r\nbeing separate from the crank-shaft, and connected with the latter by\r\ngearing, _O O_. The cylinders were 24 inches in diameter by 4 feet\r\nstroke. The paddle-wheels had buckets 4 feet long, with a dip of 2\r\nfeet. Old drawings, made by Fulton's own hand, and showing the engine\r\nas it was in 1808, and the engine of a later steamer, the Chancellor\r\nLivingston, are in the lecture-room of the author at the Stevens\r\nInstitute of Technology.\r\n\r\nThe voyage of the Clermont to Albany was attended by some ludicrous\r\nincidents, which found their counterparts wherever, subsequently,\r\nsteamers were for the first time introduced. Mr. Colden, the\r\nbiographer of Fulton, says that she was described, by persons who had\r\nseen her passing by night, \"as a monster moving on the waters, defying\r\nwind and tide, and breathing flames and smoke.\"\r\n\r\nThis first steamboat used dry pine wood for fuel, and the flames rose\r\nto a considerable distance above the smoke-pipe. When the fires were\r\ndisturbed, mingled smoke and sparks would rise high in the air. \"This\r\nuncommon light,\" says Colden, \"first attracted the attention of the\r\ncrews of other vessels. Notwithstanding the wind and tide were averse\r\nto its approach, they saw with astonishment that it was rapidly coming\r\ntoward them; and when it came so near that the noise of the machinery\r\nand paddles was heard, the crews (if what was said in the newspapers\r\nof the time be true), in some instances, shrank beneath their decks\r\nfrom the terrific sight, and left their vessels to go on shore; while\r\nothers prostrated themselves, and besought Providence to protect them\r\nfrom the approach of the horrible monster which was marching on the\r\ntides, and lighting its path by the fires which it vomited.\"\r\n\r\nIn the Clermont, Fulton used several of the now characteristic\r\nfeatures of the American river steamboat, and subsequently introduced\r\nothers. His most important and creditable work, aside from that of\r\nthe introduction of the steamboat into every-day use, was the\r\nexperimental determination of the magnitude and the laws of\r\nship-resistance, and the systematic proportioning of vessel and\r\nmachinery to the work to be done by them.\r\n\r\nThe success of the Clermont on the trial-trip was such that Fulton\r\nsoon after advertised the vessel as a regular passenger-boat between\r\nNew York and Albany.[80]\r\n\r\n  [80] A newspaper-slip in the scrap-book of the author has the\r\n  following:\r\n\r\n  \"The traveler of today, as he goes on board the great steamboats St.\r\n  John or Drew, can scarcely imagine the difference between such\r\n  floating palaces and the wee-bit punts on which our fathers were\r\n  wafted 60 years ago. We may, however, get some idea of the sort of\r\n  thing then in use by a perusal of the steamboat announcements of\r\n  that time, two of which are as follows:\r\n\r\n  [\"_Copy of an Advertisement taken from the Albany Gazette, dated\r\n  September, 1807._]\r\n\r\n  \"The North River Steamboat will leave Pauler's Hook Ferry [now\r\n  Jersey City] on Friday, the 4th of September, at 9 in the morning,\r\n  and arrive at Albany on Saturday, at 9 in the afternoon. Provisions,\r\n  good berths, and accommodations are provided.\r\n\r\n  \"The charge to each passenger is as follows:\r\n\r\n  \"To Newburg        dols. 3,    time 14 hours.\r\n   \"  Poughkeepsie     \"   4,      \"  17   \"\r\n   \"  Esopus           \"   5,      \"  20   \"\r\n   \"  Hudson           \"   5-1/2,  \"  30   \"\r\n   \"  Albany           \"   7,      \"  36   \"\r\n\r\n  \"For places, apply to William Vandervoort, No. 48 Courtlandt Street,\r\n  on the corner of Greenwich Street.\r\n\r\n  \"_September 2, 1807._\r\n\r\n  [\"_Extract from the New York Evening Post, dated October 2, 1807._]\r\n\r\n  \"Mr. Fulton's new-invented _Steamboat_, which is fitted up in a neat\r\n  style for passengers, and is intended to run from New York to Albany\r\n  as a Packet, left here this morning with 90 passengers, against a\r\n  strong head-wind. Notwithstanding which, it was judged she moved\r\n  through the waters at the rate of six miles an hour.\"\r\n\r\nDuring the next winter the Clermont was repaired and enlarged, and in\r\nthe summer of 1808 was again on the route to Albany; and, meantime,\r\ntwo new steamboats--the Raritan and the Car of Neptune--had been built\r\nby Fulton. In the year 1811 he built the Paragon. Both of the two\r\nvessels last named were of nearly double the size of the Clermont. A\r\nsteam ferry-boat was built to ply between New York and Jersey City in\r\n1812, and the next year two others, to connect the metropolis with\r\nBrooklyn. These were \"twin-boats,\" the two parallel hulls being\r\nconnected by a \"bridge\" or deck common to both. The Jersey ferry was\r\ncrossed in fifteen minutes, the distance being a mile and a half.\r\nTo-day, the time occupied at the same ferry is about ten minutes.\r\nFulton's ferry-boat carried, at one load, 8 carriages, and about 30\r\nhorses, and still had room for 300 or 400 foot-passengers. Fulton also\r\ndesigned steam-vessels for use on the Western rivers, and, in 1815,\r\nsome of his boats were started as \"packets\" on the line between New\r\nYork and Providence, R. I.\r\n\r\nMeantime, the War of 1812 was in progress, and Fulton designed a steam\r\nvessel-of-war, which was then considered a wonderfully formidable\r\ncraft. His plans were submitted to a commission of experienced naval\r\nofficers, among whom were Commodores Decatur and Perry, Captain John\r\nPaul Jones, Captain Evans, and others whose names are still familiar,\r\nand were favorably commended. Fulton proposed to build a steam-vessel\r\ncapable of carrying a heavy battery, and of steaming four miles an\r\nhour. The ship was to be fitted with furnaces for red-hot shot. Some\r\nof her guns were to be discharged below the water-line. The estimated\r\ncost was $320,000.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the vessel was authorized by Congress in March,\r\n1814; the keel was laid June 20, 1814, and the vessel was launched\r\nOctober 29th of the same year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 82.--Launch of the \"Fulton the First,\" 1804.]\r\n\r\nThe \"Fulton the First,\" as she was called, was considered an enormous\r\nvessel at that time. The hull was double, 156 feet long, 56 feet wide,\r\nand 20 feet deep, measuring 2,475 tons. In the following May the ship\r\nwas ready for her engine, and in July was so far completed as to\r\nsteam, on a trial-trip, to the ocean at Sandy Hook and back--53\r\nmiles--in 8 hours and 20 minutes. In September of the same year, with\r\narmament and stores on board, the same route was traversed again, the\r\nvessel making 5-1/2 miles an hour. The vessel, as thus completed, had\r\na double hull, each about 20 feet longer than the Clermont, and\r\nseparated by a space 15 feet across. Her engine, having a\r\nsteam-cylinder 48 inches in diameter and of 5 feet stroke of piston,\r\nwas furnished with steam by a copper boiler 22 feet long, 12 feet\r\nwide, and 8 feet high, and turned a wheel between the two hulls which\r\nwas 16 feet in diameter, and carried \"floats\" or \"buckets\" 14 feet\r\nlong, and with a dip of 4 feet. The engine was in one of the two\r\nhulls, and the boiler in the other. The sides, at the gun-deck, were 4\r\nfeet 10 inches thick, and her spar-deck was surrounded by heavy\r\nmusket-proof bulwarks. The armament consisted of 30 32-pounders, which\r\nwere intended to discharge red-hot shot. There was one heavy mast for\r\neach hull, fitted with large latteen sails. Each end of each hull was\r\nfitted with a rudder. Large pumps were carried, which were intended to\r\nthrow heavy streams of water upon the decks of the enemy, with a view\r\nto disabling the foe by wetting his ordnance and ammunition. A\r\nsubmarine gun was to have been carried at each bow, to discharge shot\r\nweighing 100 pounds, at a depth of 10 feet below the water-line.\r\n\r\nThis was the first application of the steam-engine to naval purposes,\r\nand, for the time, it was an exceedingly creditable one. Fulton,\r\nhowever, did not live to see the ship completed. He was engaged in a\r\ncontest with Livingston, who was then endeavoring to obtain permission\r\nfrom the State of New Jersey to operate a line of steamboats in the\r\nwaters of the Hudson River and New York Bay, and, while returning from\r\nattending a session of the Legislature at Trenton, in January, 1815,\r\nwas exposed to the weather on the bay at a time when he was ill\r\nprepared to withstand it. He was taken ill, and died February 24th of\r\nthat year. His death was mourned as a national calamity.\r\n\r\nFrom the above brief sketch of this distinguished man and his work, it\r\nis seen that, although Robert Fulton is not entitled to distinction as\r\nan inventor, he was one of the ablest, most persistent, and most\r\nsuccessful of those who have done so much for the world by the\r\nintroduction of the inventions of others. He was an intelligent\r\nengineer and an enterprising business-man, whose skill, acuteness, and\r\nenergy have given the world the fruits of the inventive genius of all\r\nwho preceded him, and have thus justly earned for him a fame that can\r\nnever be lost.\r\n\r\nFulton had some active and enterprising rivals.\r\n\r\nOliver Evans had, in 1801 or 1802, sent one of his engines, of about\r\n150 horse-power, to New Orleans, for the purpose of using it to propel\r\na vessel owned by Messrs. McKeever and Valcourt, which was there\r\nawaiting it. The engine was actually set up in the boat, but at a low\r\nstage of the river, and no trial could be made until the river should\r\nagain rise, some months later. Having no funds to carry them through\r\nso long a period, Evans's agents were induced to remove the engine\r\nagain, and to set it up in a saw-mill, where it created great\r\nastonishment by its extraordinary performance in sawing lumber.\r\n\r\nLivingston and Roosevelt were also engaged in experiments quite as\r\nearly as Fulton, and perhaps earlier.\r\n\r\nThe prize gained by Fulton was, however, most closely contested by\r\nColonel JOHN STEVENS, of Hoboken, who has been already mentioned in\r\nconnection with the early history of railroads, and who had been since\r\n1791 engaged in similar experiments. In 1789 he had petitioned the\r\nLegislature of the State of New York for a grant similar to that\r\naccorded to Livingston, and he then stated that his plans were\r\ncomplete, and on paper.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 83.--Section of Steam-Boiler, 1804.]\r\n\r\nIn 1804, while Fulton was in Europe, Stevens had completed a\r\nsteamboat, 68 feet long and of 14 feet beam, which combined novelties\r\nand merits of design in a manner that exhibited the best possible\r\nevidence of remarkable inventive talent, as well as of the most\r\nperfect appreciation of the nature of the problem which he had\r\nproposed to himself to solve. Its boiler (Fig. 83) was of what is now\r\nknown as the water-tubular variety. It was quite similar to some now\r\nknown as sectional boilers, and contained 100 tubes 2 inches in\r\ndiameter and 18 inches long, each fastened at one end to a central\r\nwater-leg and steam-drum, and plugged at the other end. The flames\r\nfrom the furnace passed around and among the tubes, the water being\r\ninside them. The engine (Fig. 84) was a _direct-acting high-pressure_\r\ncondensing engine, having a 10-inch cylinder, 2 feet stroke of piston,\r\nand drove a _screw_ having four blades, and of a form which, even\r\nto-day, appears quite good. The whole is a most remarkable piece of\r\nearly engineering.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 84.--Engine, Boiler, and Screw-Propellers used by\r\nStevens, 1804.]\r\n\r\nA model of this little steamer, built in 1804, is preserved in the\r\nlecture-room of the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the\r\nStevens Institute of Technology; and the machinery itself, consisting\r\nof the high-pressure \"sectional\" or \"safety\" tubular boiler, as it\r\nwould be called to-day, the high-pressure condensing engine, with\r\nrotating valves, and twin screw-propellers, as just described, is\r\ngiven a place of honor in the model-room, or museum, where it\r\ncontrasts singularly with the mechanism contributed to the collection\r\nby manufacturers and inventors of our own time. The hub and blade of a\r\nsingle screw, also used with the same machinery, is likewise to be\r\nseen there.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 85.--Stevens's Screw Steamer, 1804.]\r\n\r\nStevens seems to have been the first to fully recognize the importance\r\nof the principle involved in the construction of the sectional\r\nsteam-boiler. His eldest son, John Cox Stevens, was in Great Britain\r\nin the year 1805, and, while there, patented another modification of\r\nthis type of boiler. In his specification, he details both the method\r\nof construction and the principles which determine its form. He says\r\nthat he describes this invention as it was made known to him by his\r\nfather, and adds:\r\n\r\n\"From a series of experiments made in France, in 1790, by M. Belamour,\r\nunder the auspices of the Royal Academy of Sciences, it has been found\r\nthat, within a certain range the elasticity of steam is nearly doubled\r\nby every addition of temperature equal to 30 deg. of Fahrenheit's\r\nthermometer. These experiments were carried no higher than 280 deg., at\r\nwhich temperature the elasticity of steam was found equal to about\r\nfour times the pressure of the atmosphere. By experiments which have\r\nlately been made by myself, the elasticity of steam at the temperature\r\nof boiling oil, which has been estimated at about 600 deg., was found to\r\nequal 40 times the pressure of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n\"To the discovery of this principle or law, which obtains when water\r\nassumes a state of vapor, I certainly can lay no claim; but to the\r\napplication of it, upon certain principles, to the improvement of the\r\nsteam-engine, I do claim exclusive right.\r\n\r\n\"It is obvious that, to derive advantage from an application of this\r\nprinciple, it is absolutely necessary that the vessel or vessels for\r\ngenerating steam should have strength sufficient to withstand the\r\ngreat pressure from an increase of elasticity in the steam; but this\r\npressure is increased or diminished in proportion to the capacity of\r\nthe containing vessel. The principle, then, of this invention consists\r\nin forming a boiler by means of a system, or combination of a number\r\nof small vessels, instead of using, as in the usual mode, one large\r\none; the relative strength of the materials of which these vessels\r\nare composed increasing in proportion to the diminution of capacity.\r\nIt will readily occur that there are an infinite variety of possible\r\nmodes of effecting such combinations; but, from the nature of the\r\ncase, there are certain limits beyond which it becomes impracticable\r\nto carry on improvement. In the boiler I am about to describe, I\r\napprehend that the improvement is carried to the utmost extent of\r\nwhich the principle is capable. Suppose a plate of brass of one foot\r\nsquare, in which a number of holes are perforated; into each of which\r\nholes is fixed one end of a copper tube, of about an inch in diameter\r\nand two feet long; and the other ends of these tubes inserted in like\r\nmanner into a similar piece of brass; the tubes, to insure their\r\ntightness, to be cast in the plates; these plates are to be inclosed\r\nat each end of the pipes by a strong cap of cast-iron or brass, so as\r\nto leave a space of an inch or two between the plates or ends of the\r\npipes and the cast-iron cap at each end; the caps at each end are to\r\nbe fastened by screw-bolts passing through them into the plates; the\r\nnecessary supply of water is to be injected by means of a forcing-pump\r\ninto the cap at one end, and through a tube inserted into the cap at\r\nthe other end the steam is to be conveyed to the cylinder of the\r\nsteam-engine; the whole is then to be encircled in brickwork or\r\nmasonry in the usual manner, placed either horizontally or\r\nperpendicularly, at option.\r\n\r\n\"I conceive that the boiler above described embraces the most eligible\r\nmode of applying the principle before mentioned, and that it is\r\nunnecessary to give descriptions of the variations in form and\r\nconstruction that may be adopted, especially as these forms may be\r\ndiversified in many different modes.\"\r\n\r\nBoilers of the character of those described in the specification given\r\nabove were used on the locomotive built by John Stevens in 1824-'25,\r\nand one of them remains in the collections of the Stevens Institute of\r\nTechnology.\r\n\r\nThe use of such a boiler 70 years ago is even more remarkable than the\r\nadoption of the screw-propeller, in such excellent proportions, 30\r\nyears before the labors of Smith and of Ericsson brought the screw\r\ninto general use; and we have, in this strikingly original\r\ncombination, as good evidence of the existence of unusual engineering\r\ntalent in this great engineer as we found of his political and\r\nstatesmanlike ability in his efforts to forward the introduction of\r\nrailways.\r\n\r\nColonel John Stevens designed a peculiar form of iron-clad in the year\r\n1812, which has been since reproduced by no less distinguished and\r\nsuccessful an engineer than the late John Elder, of Glasgow, Scotland.\r\nIt consisted of a saucer-shaped hull, carrying a heavy battery, and\r\nplated with iron of ample thickness to resist the shot fired from the\r\nheaviest ordnance then known. This vessel was secured to a swivel, and\r\nwas anchored in the channel to be defended. A set of screw-propellers,\r\ndriven by steam-engines, and situated beneath the vessel, where they\r\nwere safe against injury by shot, were so arranged as to permit the\r\nvessel to be rapidly revolved about its centre. As each gun was\r\nbrought into line of fire, it was discharged, and was then reloaded\r\nbefore coming around again. This was probably the earliest embodiment\r\nof the now well-established \"Monitor\" principle. It was probably the\r\nfirst iron-clad ever designed. It has recently been again brought out\r\nand introduced into the Russian navy, and is there called the\r\n\"Popoffka.\"\r\n\r\nThe first of Stevens's boats performed so well, that he immediately\r\nbuilt another one, using the same engine as before, but employing a\r\nlarger boiler, and propelling the vessel by _twin screws_, the latter\r\nbeing another instance of his use of a device brought forward long\r\nafterward as new, and frequently adopted. This boat was sufficiently\r\nsuccessful to prove the practicability of making steam-navigation a\r\ncommercial success; and Stevens, assisted by his sons, built a boat\r\nwhich he named the \"Ph[oe]nix,\" and made the first trial in 1807, but\r\njust too late to anticipate Fulton. This boat was driven by\r\npaddle-wheels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 86.--Stevens's Twin-Screw Steamer, 1805.]\r\n\r\nThe Ph[oe]nix, being shut out of the waters of the State of New York\r\nby the monopoly held by Fulton and Livingston, was used for a time\r\nbetween New York and New Brunswick, and then, anticipating a better\r\npecuniary return, it was concluded to send her to Philadelphia, to ply\r\non the Delaware.\r\n\r\nAt that time no canal offered the opportunity to make an inland\r\npassage; and in June, 1808, Robert L. Stevens, a son of John, started\r\nwith her to make the passage by sea. Although meeting a gale of wind,\r\nhe arrived at Philadelphia safely, having been the first to trust\r\nhimself on the open sea in a vessel relying entirely upon steam-power.\r\n\r\nFrom this time forward the Stevenses, father and sons, continued to\r\nconstruct steam-vessels; and, after the breaking down of the Fulton\r\nmonopoly by the courts, they built the most successful steamboats that\r\nran on the Hudson River.\r\n\r\nAfter Fulton and Stevens had thus led the way, steam-navigation was\r\nintroduced very rapidly on both sides of the ocean; and on the\r\nMississippi the number of boats set afloat was soon large enough to\r\nfulfill Evans's prediction that the navigation of that river would\r\nultimately be effected by steam-vessels.\r\n\r\nThe changes and improvements which, during the 20 years succeeding the\r\ntime of Fulton and of John Stevens, gradually led to the adoption of\r\nthe now recognized type of \"American river-boat\" and its steam-engine,\r\nwere principally made by that son of the senior Stevens, who has\r\nalready been mentioned--ROBERT L. STEVENS--and who became known later\r\nas the designer and builder of the first well-planned iron-clad ever\r\nconstructed, the Stevens Battery. Much of his best work was done\r\nduring his father's lifetime.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Robert L. Stevens.]\r\n\r\nHe made many extended and most valuable, as well as interesting,\r\nexperiments on ship-propulsion, expending much time and large sums of\r\nmoney upon them; and many years before they became generally\r\nunderstood, he had arrived at a knowledge not only of the laws\r\ngoverning the variation of resistance at excessive speeds, but he had\r\ndetermined, and had introduced into his practice, those forms of least\r\nresistance and those graceful water-lines which have only recently\r\ndistinguished the practice of other successful naval architects.\r\n\r\nReferring to his invaluable services, President King, who seems to\r\nhave been the first to thoroughly appreciate the immense amount of\r\noriginal invention and the surprising excellence of the engineering of\r\nthis family, in a lecture delivered in New York in 1851, gave, for the\r\nfirst time, a connected and probably accurate description of their\r\nwork, upon which nearly all later accounts have been based.\r\n\r\nYoung Stevens began working in his father's machine-shop in 1804 or\r\n1805, when a mere boy, and thus acquired at a very early age that\r\nfamiliarity with practical details of work and of business which is\r\nessential to perfect success. It was he who introduced the now common\r\n\"hollow water-line\" in the Ph[oe]nix, and thus anticipated the claims\r\nof the builders of the once famous \"Baltimore clippers,\" and of the\r\ninventors of the \"wave-line\" form of vessels. In the same vessel he\r\nadopted a feathering paddle-wheel and the guard-beam now universally\r\nseen in our river steamboats.\r\n\r\nAs usually constructed, this arrangement of float is as shown in Fig.\r\n87. The rods, _F F_, connect the eccentrically-set collar, _G_,\r\ncarried on _H_, a pin mounted on the paddle-beam outside the wheel, or\r\nan eccentric secured to the vessel, with the short arms, _D D_, by\r\nwhich the paddles are turned upon the pins, _E E_. _A_ is the centre\r\nof the paddle-wheel, and _C C_ are arms. Circular hoops, or bands,\r\nconnect all of the arms, each of which carries a float. They are all\r\nthus tied together, forming a very firm and powerful combination to\r\nresist external forces.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 87.--The Feathering Paddle-Wheel.]\r\n\r\nThe steamboat Philadelphia was built in the year 1813, and the young\r\nnaval architect took advantage of the opportunity to introduce several\r\nnew devices, including screw-bolts in place of tree-nails, and\r\ndiagonal knees of wood and of iron. Two years later he altered the\r\nengines of this boat, and arranged them to work steam expansively. A\r\nlittle later he commenced using anthracite coal, which had been\r\ndiscovered in 1791 by Philip Ginter, and introduced at Wilkesbarre,\r\nPa., in the smith-shops, some years before the Revolution. It had been\r\nused in a peculiar grate devised by Judge Fell, of that town, in 1808.\r\nOliver Evans also had used it in stoves even earlier than the latter\r\ndate, and at about the same time it had been used in the\r\nblast-furnace[81] at Kingston. Stevens was the first of whom we have\r\nrecord who was thoroughly successful in using, as a steam-coal, the\r\nnew and almost unmanageable fuel. He fitted up the boiler of the\r\nsteamboat Passaic for it in 1818, and adopted anthracite as a\r\nsteaming-coal. He used it in a cupola-furnace in the same year, and\r\nits use then rapidly became general in the Eastern States.\r\n\r\n  [81] Bishop.\r\n\r\nStevens continued his work of improving the beam-engine for many\r\nyears. He designed the now universally-used \"skeleton-beam,\" which is\r\none of the characteristic features of the American engine, and placed\r\nthe first example of this light and elegant, yet strong, construction\r\non the steamer Hoboken in the year 1822. He built the Trenton, which\r\nwas then considered an extraordinarily powerful, fast, and handsome\r\nvessel, two years afterward, and placed the two boilers on the\r\nguards--a custom which is still general on the river steamboats of the\r\nEastern States. In this vessel he also adopted the plan of making the\r\npaddle-wheel floats in two parts, placing one above the other, and\r\nsecuring the upper half on the forward and the lower half on the after\r\nside of the arm, thus obtaining a smoother action of the wheel, and\r\nless loss by oblique pressures.\r\n\r\nIn 1827 he built the North America (Fig. 88), one of his largest and\r\nmost successful steamers, a vessel fitted with a pair of engines each\r\n44-1/2 inches in diameter of cylinder and 8 feet stroke of piston,\r\nmaking 24 revolutions per minute, driving the boat 15 to 16 miles an\r\nhour. Anticipating difficulty in keeping the long, light, shallow\r\nvessel in shape when irregularly laden, and when steaming at the high\r\nspeed expected to be obtained when her powerful engine was exerting\r\nits maximum effort, he adopted the expedient of stiffening the hull by\r\nmeans of a truss of simple form. This proved thoroughly satisfactory,\r\nand the \"hog-frame,\" as it has since been inelegantly but universally\r\ncalled, is still one of the peculiar features of every American\r\nriver-steamer of any considerable size. It was in the North America,\r\nalso, that he first introduced the artificial blast for forcing the\r\nfires, which is still another detail of now usual practice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 88.--The North America and Albany, 1827-'30.]\r\n\r\nStevens next turned his attention to the engine again, and adopted\r\nspring bearings under the paddle-shaft of the New Philadelphia in\r\n1828, and fitted the steam-cylinder with the \"double-poppet\" valve,\r\nwhich is now universally used on beam-engines. This consists of two\r\ndisk-valves, connected by the valve-spindle. The disks are of unequal\r\nsizes, the smaller passing through the seat of the larger. When\r\nseated, the pressure of the steam is, in the steam-valve, taken on the\r\nupper side of the larger and the lower side of the smaller disk, thus\r\nproducing a partial balancing of the valve, and rendering it easy to\r\nwork the heaviest engine by the hand-gear. The two valve-seats are\r\nformed in the top and the bottom, respectively, of the steam-passage\r\nleading to the cylinder; and when the valve is raised, the steam\r\nenters at the top and the bottom at the same time, and the two\r\ncurrents, uniting, flow together into the steam-cylinder. The same\r\nform of valve is used as an exhaust-valve.\r\n\r\nAt about the same time he built the now standard form of return\r\ntubular boilers for moderate pressures. In the figure, _S_ is the\r\nsteam and _W_ the water space, and _F_ the furnace. The direction of\r\nthe currents of smoke and gas are shown by the arrows.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 89.--Stevens's Return Tubular Boiler, 1832.]\r\n\r\nSome years later (1840), Stevens commenced using steam-packed pistons\r\non the Trenton, in which steam was admitted by self-adjusting valves\r\nbehind the metallic packing-rings, setting them out more effectively\r\nthan did the steel springs then (and still) usually employed.\r\n\r\nHis pistons, thus fitted, worked well for many years. A set of the\r\nsmall brass check-valves used in a piston of this kind, built by\r\nStevens, and preserved in the cabinets of the Stevens Institute of\r\nTechnology, are good evidence of the ingenuity and excellent\r\nworkmanship which distinguished the machinery constructed under the\r\ndirection of this great engineer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 90.--Stevens's Valve-Motion.]\r\n\r\nThe now familiar \"Stevens cut-off,\" a peculiar device for securing the\r\nexpansion of steam in the steam-cylinder, was the invention (1841) of\r\nRobert L. Stevens and a nephew, who inherited the same constructive\r\ntalent which distinguished the first of these great men--Mr. Francis\r\nB. Stevens. In this form of valve-gear, the steam and exhaust valves\r\nare independently worked by separate eccentrics, the latter being set\r\nin the usual manner, opening and closing the exhaust-passages just\r\nbefore the crank passes its centre. The steam-eccentric is so placed\r\nthat the steam-valve is opened as usual, but closed when but about\r\none-half the stroke has been made. This result is accomplished by\r\ngiving the eccentric a greater throw than is required by the motion of\r\nthe valve, and permitting it to move through a portion of its path\r\nwithout moving the valve. Thus, in Fig. 90, if _A B_ be the direction\r\nof motion of the eccentric-rod, the valve would ordinarily open the\r\nsteam-port when the eccentric assumes the position _O C_, closing when\r\nthe eccentric has passed around to _O D_. With the Stevens valve-gear,\r\nthe valve is opened when the eccentric reaches _O E_, and closes when\r\nit arrives at _O F_. The steam-valve of the opposite end of the\r\ncylinder is open while the eccentric is moving from _O M_ to _O K_.\r\nBetween _K_ and _E_, and between _F_ and _M_, both valves are seated.\r\n_H B_ is proportional to the lift of the valve, and _O H_ to the\r\nmotion of the valve-gear when out of contact with the valve-lifters.\r\nWhile the crank is moving through an arc, _E F_, steam is entering the\r\ncylinder; from _F_ to _M_ the steam is expanding. At _M_ the stroke is\r\ncompleted, and the other steam-valve opens. The ratio (E M)/(E L) is\r\nthe ratio of expansion.\r\n\r\nThis form of cut-off motion is still a very usual one, and can be seen\r\nin nearly all steamers in the United States not using the device of\r\nSickles. It was at about this time, also, that Stevens, having\r\nsucceeded his father in the business of introducing the steam-engine\r\nin land-transportation, as well as on the water, adopted the use of\r\nsteam expansively on the locomotives of the Camden & Amboy Railroad,\r\nwhich was controlled and built by capital furnished principally by the\r\nMessrs. Stevens. He at the same time constructed eight-wheeled engines\r\nfor heavy work, and adopted anthracite coal as fuel. In the latter\r\nchange he was thoroughly successful, and the same improvement was made\r\nwith engines built for fast traffic in 1848.\r\n\r\nThe most remarkable of all the applications of steam-power proposed by\r\nRobert L. Stevens was that known as the Stevens Steam Iron-Clad\r\nBattery. As has already been stated, Colonel John Stevens had\r\nproposed, as early as 1812, to build a circular or saucer-shaped\r\niron-clad, like those built 60 years later for the Russian Navy.\r\nNothing was done, however, although the son revived the idea in a\r\nmodified form 20 years afterward. In the years 1813-'14, the war with\r\nEngland being then in progress, he invented, after numerous and\r\nhazardous experiments, an _elongated shell_, to be fired from ordinary\r\nsmooth-bored cannon. Having perfected this invention, he sold the\r\nsecret to the United States, after making experiments to prove their\r\ndestructiveness so decisive as to leave no doubt of the efficacy of\r\nsuch projectiles.\r\n\r\nAs early as 1837 he had perfected a plan of an iron-clad war-vessel,\r\nand in August, 1841, his brothers, James C. and Edwin A. Stevens,\r\nrepresenting Robert L., addressed a letter to the Secretary of the\r\nNavy, proposing to build an iron-clad vessel of high speed, with all\r\nits machinery below the water-line, and having submerged\r\nscrew-propellers. The armament was to consist of the most powerful\r\nrifled guns, loading at the breech, and provided with elongated shot\r\nand shell. In the year 1842, having contracted to build for the United\r\nStates Government a large war-steamer on this plan, which should be\r\nshot and shell proof, Robert L. Stevens built a steamboat at\r\nBordentown, for the sole purpose of experimenting on the forms and\r\ncurves of propeller-blades, as compared with side-wheels, and\r\ncontinued his experiments for many months. After some delay, during\r\nwhich Mr. Stevens and his brothers were engaged with their experiments\r\nand in perfecting their plans, the keel of an iron-clad was laid down\r\nin a dry-dock which had been constructed for the purpose at great\r\ncost. This vessel was to have been 250 feet long, of 40 feet beam, and\r\n28 feet deep. The machinery was designed to furnish 700 indicated\r\nhorse-power. The plating was proposed to be 4-1/2 inches thick--the\r\nsame thickness of armor as was adopted 10 years later by the French\r\nfor their comparatively rude constructions.\r\n\r\nIn 1854, such marked progress had been made in the construction of\r\nordnance that Mr. Stevens was no longer willing to proceed with the\r\noriginal plans, fearing that, were the ship completed, it might prove\r\nnot invulnerable, and might throw some discredit upon its designer, as\r\nwell as upon the navy of which it was to form a part. The work, which\r\nhad, in those years of peace, progressed very slowly and\r\nintermittently, was therefore stopped entirely, the vessel given up,\r\nand in 1854 the keel of a ship of vastly greater size and power was\r\nlaid down. The new design was 415 feet long, of 45 feet beam, and of\r\nsomething over 5,000 tons displacement. The thickness of armor\r\nproposed was 6-3/4 inches--2-1/4 inches thicker than that of the\r\nfirst French and British iron-clads--and the machinery was designed by\r\nMr. Stevens to be of 8,624 indicated horse-power, driving twin-screws,\r\nand propelling the vessel 20 miles or more an hour. As with the\r\npreceding design, the progress of construction was intermittent and\r\nvery slow. Government advanced funds, and then refused to continue the\r\nwork; successive administrations alternately encouraged and\r\ndiscouraged the engineer; and he finally, cutting loose entirely from\r\nall official connections, went on with the work at his own expense.\r\n\r\nThe remarkable genius of the elder Stevens was well reflected in the\r\ncharacter of his son, and is in no way better exemplified than by the\r\naccuracy with which, in this great ship, those forms and proportions,\r\nboth of hull and machinery, were adopted which are now, twenty-five\r\nyears later, recognized as most correct under similar conditions. The\r\nlines of the vessel are beautifully fair and fine, and are what J.\r\nScott Russell has called \"wave-lines,\" or trochoidal lines, such as\r\nRankine has shown to be the best possible for easy propulsion. The\r\nproportion of length to midship dimensions is such as to secure the\r\nspeed proposed with a minimum resistance, and to accord closely with\r\nthe proportions arrived at and adopted by common consent in present\r\ntransoceanic navigation by the best--not to say radical--builders.\r\n\r\nThe death of Robert L. Stevens occurred in April, 1856, when this\r\nlarger vessel had advanced so far toward completion that the hull and\r\nmachinery were practically finished, and it only remained to add the\r\narmor-plating, and to decide upon the form of fighting-house and upon\r\nthe number and size of guns. The construction of the vessel, which had\r\nproceeded slowly and intermittently during the years of peace, as\r\nsuccessive administrations had considered it necessary to continue the\r\npayment of appropriations, or had stopped temporarily in the absence\r\nof any apparent immediate necessity for continuance of the work, was\r\nagain interrupted by his death.\r\n\r\nThe name of Robert L. Stevens will be long remembered as that of one\r\nof the greatest of American mechanics, the most intelligent of naval\r\narchitects, and as the first, and one of the greatest, of those to\r\nwhom we are indebted for the commencement of the mightiest of\r\nrevolutions in the methods and implements of modern naval warfare.\r\nAmerican mechanical genius and engineering skill have rarely been too\r\npromptly recognized, and no excuse will be required for an attempt\r\n(which it is hoped may yet be made) to place such splendid work as\r\nthat of the Messrs. Stevens in a light which shall reveal both its\r\nvariety and extent and its immense importance.\r\n\r\nWhile Fulton was introducing the steamboat upon the waters of New York\r\nBay and the Hudson River, and while the Stevenses, father and sons,\r\nwere rapidly bringing out a fleet of steamers on the Delaware River\r\nand Bay, other mechanics were preparing to contest the field with them\r\nas opportunity offered, and as legislative acts authorizing monopoly\r\nexpired by limitation or were repealed.\r\n\r\nAbout 1821, Robert L. Thurston, John Babcock, and Captain Stephen T.\r\nNortham, of Newport, R. I., commenced building steamboats, beginning\r\nwith a small craft intended for use at Slade's Ferry, on an arm of\r\nNarragansett Bay, near Fall River. They afterward built vessels to ply\r\non Long Island Sound. One of their earliest boats was the Babcock,\r\nbuilt at Newport in 1826. The engine was built by Thurston and\r\nBabcock, at Portsmouth, R. I. They were assisted in their work by\r\nRichard Sanford, and with funds by Northam. The engine was of 10 or 12\r\ninches diameter of cylinder, and 3 or 4 feet stroke of piston. The\r\nboiler was a form of \"pipe-boiler,\" subsequently (1824) patented by\r\nBabcock. The water used was injected into the hot boiler as fast as\r\nrequired to furnish steam, no water being retained in the\r\nsteam-generator. This boat was succeeded, in 1827-'28, by a larger\r\nvessel, the Rushlight, for which the engine was built by James P.\r\nAllaire, at New York, while the boat was built at Newport. The boilers\r\nof both vessels had tubes of cast-iron. The smaller of these boats was\r\nof 80 tons burden; it steamed from Newport to Providence, 30 miles, in\r\n3-1/2 hours, and to New York, a distance of 175 miles, in 25 hours,\r\nusing 1-3/4 cord of wood.[82] Thurston and Babcock subsequently\r\nremoved to Providence, where the latter soon died. Thurston continued\r\nto build steam-engines at this place until nearly a half-century\r\nlater, dying in 1874.[83] The establishment founded by him, after\r\nvarious changes, became the Providence Steam-Engine Works.\r\n\r\n  [82] _American Journal of Science_, March, 1827; _London Mechanics'\r\n  Magazine_, June 16, 1827.\r\n\r\n  [83] \"New Universal Cyclopaedia,\" vol. iv., 1878.\r\n\r\nJames P. Allaire, of New York, the West Point Iron Foundery, at West\r\nPoint, on the Hudson River, and Daniel Copeland and his son, Charles\r\nW. Copeland, on the Connecticut River, were also early builders of\r\nengines for steam-vessels. Daniel Copeland was probably the first\r\n(1850) to adopt a slide-valve working with a lap to secure the\r\nexpansion of steam. His steamboats were then usually stern-wheel\r\nvessels, and were built to ply on several routes on the Connecticut\r\nRiver and Long Island Sound. The son, Charles W. Copeland,\r\nwent to West Point, and while there designed some heavy marine\r\nsteam-machinery, and subsequently designed several steam\r\nvessels-of-war for the United States Navy. He was the earliest\r\ndesigner of iron steamers in the United States, building the Siamese\r\nin 1838. This steamer was intended for use on Lake Pontchartrain and\r\nthe canal to New Orleans. It had two hulls, was 110 feet long, and\r\ndrew but 22 inches of water, loaded. The two horizontal non-condensing\r\nengines turned a single paddle-wheel placed between the two hulls,\r\ndriving the boat 10 miles an hour. The hull was constructed of plates\r\nof iron 10 feet long, formed on blocks after having been heated in a\r\nfurnace constructed especially for the purpose. The frames were of\r\nT-iron, which was probably here used for the first time. The same\r\nengineer, associated with Samuel Hart, a well-known naval constructor,\r\nbuilt, in 1841, for the United States Navy, the iron steamer Michigan,\r\na war-vessel intended for service on the great northern lakes. This\r\nvessel is still in service, and in good order. The hull is 162-1/2\r\nfeet in length, 27 feet in breadth, and 12-1/2 feet in depth,\r\nmeasuring 500 tons. The frames were made of T-iron, stiffened by\r\nreverse bars of L-iron. The keel-plate was 5/8 inch thick, the bottom\r\nplates 3/8, and the sides 3/16 inch. The deck-beams were of iron, and\r\nthe vessel, as a whole, was a good specimen of iron-ship building.\r\n\r\nDuring the period from 1830 to 1840, a considerable number of the now\r\nstandard details of steam-engine and steamboat construction were\r\ndevised or introduced by Copeland. He was probably the first to use\r\n(on the Fulton, 1840) an independent engine to drive the blowing-fans\r\nwhere an artificial draught was required. He made a practice of\r\nfitting his steamers with a \"bilge-injection,\" by means of which the\r\nvessel could be freed of water, through the condenser and air-pump,\r\nwhen leaking seriously; the condensing-water is, in such a case, taken\r\nfrom inside the vessel, instead of from the sea. This is probably an\r\nAmerican device. It was in use in the United States previously to\r\n1835, as was the use of anthracite coal on steamers, which was\r\ncontinued by Copeland in manufacturing and in air-furnaces, as well as\r\non steamboats. He also modified the form of Stevens's double-poppet\r\nvalve, giving it such shape that it was comparatively easy to grind it\r\ntight and to keep it in order.\r\n\r\nIn 1825, James P. Allaire, of New York, built compound engines for the\r\nHenry Eckford, and subsequently constructed similar engines for\r\nseveral other steamers, one of which, the Sun, made the trip from New\r\nYork to Albany in 12 hours 18 minutes. He used steam at 100 pounds\r\npressure. Erastus W. Smith afterward introduced this form of engine on\r\nthe Great Lakes, and still later they were introduced into British\r\nsteamers. The machinery of the steamer Buckeye State was constructed\r\nat the Allaire Works, New York, in 1850, from the designs of John\r\nBaird and Erastus W. Smith, the latter being the designing and\r\nconstructing engineer. The steamer was placed on the route between\r\nBuffalo, Cleveland, and Detroit, in 1851, and gave most satisfactory\r\nresults, consuming less than two-thirds the fuel required by a similar\r\nvessel of the same line fitted with the single-cylinder engine. The\r\nsteam-cylinders of this engine were placed one within the other, the\r\nlow-pressure exterior cylinder being annular. They were 37 and 80\r\ninches in diameter respectively, and the stroke was 11 feet. Both\r\npistons were connected to one cross-head, and the general arrangement\r\nof the engine was similar to that of the common form of beam-engine.\r\nThe steam-pressure was from 70 to 75 pounds--about the maximum\r\npressure adopted a quarter of a century later on transatlantic lines.\r\nThis steamer was of high speed, as well as economical of fuel.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1830, there were 86 steamers on the Hudson River and in\r\nLong Island Sound.\r\n\r\nDuring the early part of the nineteenth century, the introduction of\r\nthe steamboat upon the waters of the great rivers of the interior of\r\nthe United States was one of the most notable details of its history.\r\nInaugurated by the unsuccessful experiment of Evans, the building of\r\nsteamboats on those waters, once commenced, never ceased; and a\r\ngeneration after Fitch's burial on the shore of the Ohio, his last\r\nwish--that he might lie \"where the song of the boatman would enliven\r\nthe stillness of his resting-place, and the music of the steam-engine\r\nsoothe his spirit\"--was fulfilled day by day unceasingly.\r\n\r\nNicholas J. Roosevelt was, as has been already stated, the first to\r\ntake a steamboat down the great rivers. His boat was built at\r\nPittsburgh in 1811, under an arrangement with Fulton and Livingston,\r\nfrom Fulton's plans. It was called the \"New Orleans,\" was of about 200\r\ntons burden, and was propelled by a stern-wheel, assisted, when the\r\nwinds were favorable, by sails carried on two masts. The hull was 138\r\nfeet long, 30 feet beam, and the cost of the whole, including engines,\r\nwas about $40,000. The builder, with his family, an engineer, a pilot,\r\nand six \"deck-hands,\" left Pittsburgh in October, 1811, reaching\r\nLouisville in 70 hours (steaming about 10 miles an hour), and New\r\nOrleans in 14 days, steaming from Natchez.\r\n\r\nThe next steamers built on Western waters were probably the Comet and\r\nthe Vesuvius, both of which were in service some time. The Comet was\r\nfinally laid aside, and the engine used to drive a mill, and the\r\nVesuvius was destroyed by the explosion of her boilers. As early as\r\n1813 there were two shops at Pittsburgh building steam-engines.\r\nSteamboat-building now became an important and lucrative business in\r\nthe West; and it is stated that as early as 1840 there were a thousand\r\nsteamers on the Mississippi and its tributaries.\r\n\r\nIn the Washington, built at Wheeling, Va., in 1816, under the\r\ndirection of Captain Henry M. Shreve, the boilers, which had\r\npreviously been placed in the hold, were carried on the main-deck, and\r\na \"hurricane-deck\" was built over them. Shreve substituted two\r\nhorizontal direct-acting engines for the single upright engine used by\r\nFulton, drove them by high-pressure steam without condensation, and\r\nattached them, one on each side the boat, to cranks placed at right\r\nangles. He adopted a cam cut-off expanding the steam considerably, and\r\nthe flue-boiler of Evans. At that time the voyage from New Orleans to\r\nLouisville occupied three weeks, and Shreve was made the subject of\r\nmany witticisms when he predicted that the time would ultimately be\r\nshortened to ten days. It is now made in four days. The Washington was\r\nseized at New Orleans, in 1817, by order of Livingston, who claimed\r\nthat his rights included the monopoly of the navigation of the\r\nMississippi and its tributaries. The courts decided adversely on this\r\nclaim, and the release of the Washington was the act which removed\r\nevery obstacle to the introduction of steam-navigation throughout the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\nThe first steamer on the Great Lakes was the Ontario, built in 1816,\r\nat Sackett's Harbor. Fifteen years later, Western steamboats had taken\r\nthe peculiar form which has since usually distinguished them.\r\n\r\nThe use of the steam-engine for ocean-navigation kept pace with its\r\nintroduction on inland waters. Begun by Robert L. Stevens in the\r\nUnited States, in the year 1808, and by his contemporaries, Bell and\r\nDodd, in Great Britain, it steadily and rapidly advanced in\r\neffectiveness and importance, and has now nearly driven the sailing\r\nfleet from the ocean. Transatlantic steam-navigation began with the\r\nvoyage of the American steamer Savannah from Savannah, Ga., to St.\r\nPetersburg, Russia, _via_ Great Britain and the North-European ports,\r\nin the year 1819. Fulton, not long before his death, planned a vessel,\r\nwhich it was proposed to place in service in the Baltic Sea; but\r\ncircumstances compelled a change of plan finally, and the steamer was\r\nplaced on a line between Newport, R. I., and the city of New York; and\r\nthe Savannah, several years later, made the voyage then proposed for\r\nFulton's ship. The Savannah measured 350 tons, and was constructed by\r\nCrocker & Fickett, at Corlears Hook, N. Y. She was purchased by Mr.\r\nScarborough, of Savannah, who placed Captain Moses Rogers, previously\r\nin command of the Clermont and of Stevens's boat, the Ph[oe]nix, in\r\ncharge. The ship was fitted with steam-machinery and paddle-wheels,\r\nand sailed for Savannah April 27, 1819, making the voyage successfully\r\nin seven days. From Savannah, the vessel sailed for Liverpool May\r\n26th, and arrived at that port June 20th. During this trip the engines\r\nwere used 18 days, and the remainder of the voyage was made under\r\nsail. From Liverpool the Savannah sailed, July 23d, for the Baltic,\r\ntouching at Copenhagen, Stockholm, St. Petersburg, and other ports. At\r\nSt. Petersburg, Lord Lyndock, who had been a passenger, was landed;\r\nand, on taking leave of the commander of the steamer, the\r\ndistinguished guest presented him with a silver tea-kettle, suitably\r\ninscribed with a legend referring to the importance of the event which\r\nafforded him the opportunity. The Savannah left St. Petersburg in\r\nNovember, passing New York December 9th, and reaching Savannah in 50\r\ndays from the date of departure, stopping four days at Copenhagen,\r\nDenmark, and an equal length of time at Arundel, Norway. Several\r\nsevere gales were met in the Atlantic, but no serious injury was done\r\nto the ship.\r\n\r\nThe Savannah was a full-rigged ship. The wheels were turned by an\r\ninclined direct-acting low-pressure engine, having a steam-cylinder 40\r\ninches in diameter and 6 feet stroke of piston. The paddle-wheels were\r\nof wrought-iron, and were so attached that they could be detached and\r\nhoisted on board when it was desired. After the return of the ship to\r\nthe United States, the machinery was removed and was sold to the\r\nAllaire Works, of New York. The steam-cylinder was exhibited by the\r\npurchasers at the \"World's Fair\" at New York thirty years later. The\r\nvessel was employed, as a sailing-vessel, on a line between New York\r\nand Savannah, and was finally lost in the year 1822. Under sail, with\r\na moderate breeze, this ship is said to have sailed about three knots,\r\nand to have steamed five knots. Pine-wood was used as the fuel, which\r\nfact accounts for the necessity of making the transatlantic voyage\r\npartly under sail.\r\n\r\nRenwick states that another vessel, ship-rigged and fitted with a\r\nsteam-engine, was built at New York in 1819, to ply between New York\r\nand Charleston, and to New Orleans and Havana, and that it proved\r\nperfectly successful as a steamer, having good speed, and proving an\r\nexcellent sea-boat. The enterprise was, however, pecuniarily a\r\nfailure, and the vessel was sold to the Brazilian Government after the\r\nremoval of the engine. In 1825 the steamer Enterprise made a voyage to\r\nIndia, sailing and steaming as the weather and the supply of fuel\r\npermitted. The voyage occupied 47 days.\r\n\r\nNotwithstanding these successful passages across the ocean, and the\r\ncomplete success of the steamboat in rivers and harbors, it was\r\nasserted, as late as 1838, by many who were regarded as authority,\r\nthat the passage of the ocean by steamers was quite impracticable,\r\nunless possibly they could steam from the coasts of Europe to\r\nNewfoundland or to the Azores, and, replenishing their coal-bunkers,\r\nresume their voyages to the larger American ports. The voyage was,\r\nhowever, actually accomplished by two steamers in the year just\r\nmentioned. These were the Sirius, a ship of 700 tons and of 250\r\nhorse-power, and the Great Western, of 1,340 tons and 450 horse-power.\r\nThe latter was built for this service, and was a large ship for that\r\ntime, measuring 236 feet in length. Her wheels were 28 feet in\r\ndiameter, and 10 feet in breadth of face. The Sirius sailed from Cork\r\nApril 4, 1838, and the Great Western from Bristol April 8th, both\r\narriving at New York on the same day--April 23d--the Sirius in the\r\nmorning, and the Great Western in the afternoon.\r\n\r\nThe Great Western carried out of Bristol 660 tons of coal. Seven\r\npassengers chose to take advantage of the opportunity, and made the\r\nvoyage in one-half the time usually occupied by the sailing-packets of\r\nthat day. Throughout the voyage the wind and sea were nearly ahead,\r\nand the two vessels pursued the same course, under very similar\r\nconditions. Arriving at New York, they were received with the greatest\r\npossible enthusiasm. They were saluted by the forts and the men-of-war\r\nin the harbor; the merchant-vessels dipped their flags, and the\r\ncitizens assembled on the Battery, and, coming to meet them in boats\r\nof all kinds and sizes, cheered heartily. The newspapers of the time\r\nwere filled with the story of the voyage and with descriptions of the\r\nsteamers themselves and of their machinery.\r\n\r\nA few days later the two steamers started on their return to Great\r\nBritain, the Sirius reaching Falmouth safely in 18 days, and the Great\r\nWestern making the voyage to Bristol in 15 days, the latter meeting\r\nwith head-winds and working, during a part of the time, against a\r\nheavy gale and in a high sea, at the rate of but two knots an hour.\r\nThe Sirius was thought too small for this long and boisterous route,\r\nand was withdrawn and replaced on the line between London and Cork,\r\nwhere the ship had previously been employed. The Great Western\r\ncontinued several years in the transatlantic trade.\r\n\r\nThus these two voyages inaugurated a transoceanic steam-service, which\r\nhas steadily grown in extent and in importance. The use of steam-power\r\nfor this work of extended ocean-transportation has never since been\r\ninterrupted. During the succeeding six years the Great Western made 70\r\npassages across the Atlantic, occupying on the voyages to the westward\r\nan average of 15-1/2 days, and eastward 13-1/2. The quickest passage\r\nto New York was made in May, 1843, in 12 days and 18 hours, and the\r\nfastest steaming was logged 12 months earlier, when the voyage from\r\nNew York was made in 12 days and 7 hours.\r\n\r\nMeantime, several other steamers were built and placed in the\r\ntransatlantic trade. Among these were the Royal William, the British\r\nQueen, the President, the Liverpool, and the Great Britain. The\r\nlatter, the finest of the fleet, was launched in 1843. This steamer\r\nwas 300 feet long, 50 feet beam, and of 1,000 horse-power. The hull\r\nwas of iron, and the whole ship was an example of the very best work\r\nof that time. After several voyages, this vessel went ashore on the\r\ncoast of Ireland, and there remained several weeks, but was finally\r\ngot off, without having suffered serious injury--a remarkable\r\nillustration of the stanchness of an iron hull when well built and of\r\ngood material. The vessel was repaired, and many years afterward was\r\nstill afloat, and engaged in the transportation of passengers and\r\nmerchandise to Australia.\r\n\r\nThe \"Cunard Line\" of transatlantic steamers was established in the\r\nyear 1840. The first of the line--the Britannia--sailed from Liverpool\r\nfor New York, July 4th of that year, and was followed, on regular\r\nsailing-days, by the other three of the four ships with which the\r\ncompany commenced business. These four vessels had an aggregate\r\ntonnage of 4,600 tons, and their speed was less than eight knots.\r\nTo-day, the tonnage of a single vessel of the fleet exceeds that of\r\nthe four; the total tonnage has risen to many times that above given.\r\nThere are 50 steamers in the line, aggregating nearly 50,000\r\nhorse-power. The speed of the steamships of the present time is double\r\nthat of the vessels of that date, and passages are not infrequently\r\nmade in eight days.\r\n\r\nThe form of steam-engine in most general use at this time, on\r\ntransatlantic steamers, was that known as the \"side-lever engine.\" It\r\nwas first given the standard form by Messrs. Maudsley & Co., of\r\nLondon, about 1835, and was built by them for steamers supplied to the\r\nBritish Government for general mail service.\r\n\r\nThe steam-vessels of the time are well represented in the accompanying\r\nengraving (Fig. 91) of the steamship Atlantic--a vessel which was\r\nshortly afterward (1851) built as the pioneer steamer of the American\r\n\"Collins Line.\" This steamship was one of several which formed the\r\nearliest of American steamship-lines, and is one of the finest\r\nexamples of the type of paddle-steamers which was finally superseded\r\nby the later screw-fleets. The \"Collins Line\" existed but a very few\r\nyears, and its failure was probably determined as much by the evident\r\nand inevitable success of screw-propulsion as by the difficulty of\r\nsecuring ample capital, complete organization, and efficient general\r\nmanagement. This steamer was built at New York--the hull by William\r\nBrown, and the machinery by the Novelty Iron-Works. The length of the\r\nhull was 276 feet, its breadth 45 feet, and the depth of hold 31-1/2\r\nfeet. The width over the paddle-boxes was 75 feet. The ship measured\r\n2,860 tons. The form of the hull was then peculiar in the fineness of\r\nits lines; the bow was sharp, and the stern fine and smooth, and the\r\ngeneral outline such as best adapted the ship for high speed. The main\r\nsaloon was about 70 feet long, and the dining-room was 60 feet in\r\nlength and 20 feet wide. The state-rooms were arranged on each side\r\nthe dining \"saloon,\" and accommodated 150 passengers. These vessels\r\nwere beautifully fitted up, and with them was inaugurated that\r\nwonderful system of passenger-transportation which has since always\r\nbeen distinguished by those comforts and conveniences which the\r\nAmerican traveler has learned to consider his by right.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 91.--The Atlantic, 1851.]\r\n\r\nThe machinery of these ships was, for that time, remarkably powerful\r\nand efficient. The engines were of the side-lever type, as\r\nillustrated in Fig. 92, which represents the engine of the Pacific,\r\ndesigned by Mr. Charles W. Copeland, and built by the Allaire Works.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 92.--The Side-Lever Engine, 1849.]\r\n\r\nIn this type of engine, as is seen, the piston-rod was attached to a\r\ncross-head working vertically, from which, at each side, links, _B C_,\r\nconnected with the \"side-lever,\" _D E F_. The latter vibrated about a\r\n\"main centre\" at _E_, like the overhead beam of the more common form\r\nof engine; from its other end, a \"connecting-rod,\" _H_, led to the\r\n\"cross-tail,\" _W_, which was, in turn, connected to the crank-pin,\r\n_I_. The condenser, _M_, and air-pump, _Q_, were constructed in the\r\nsame manner as those of other engines, their only peculiarities being\r\nsuch as were incident to their location between the cylinder, _A_, and\r\nthe crank, _I J_. The paddle-wheels were of the common \"radial\" form,\r\ncovered in by paddle-boxes so strongly built that they were rarely\r\ninjured by the heaviest seas.\r\n\r\nThese vessels surpassed, for a time, all other sea-going steamers in\r\nspeed and comfort, and made their passages with great regularity. The\r\nminimum length of voyage of the Baltic and Pacific, of this line, was\r\n9 days 19 hours.\r\n\r\nDuring the latter part of the period the history of which has been\r\nhere given, the marine steam-engine became subject to very marked\r\nchanges in type and in details, and a complete revolution was effected\r\nin the method of propulsion. This change has finally resulted in the\r\nuniversal adoption of a new propelling instrument, and in driving the\r\nwhole fleet of paddle-steamers from the ocean. The Great Britain was a\r\nscrew-steamer.\r\n\r\nThe screw-propeller, which, as has been stated, was probably first\r\nproposed by Dr. Hooke in 1681, and by Dr. Bernouilli, of Groningen, at\r\nabout the middle of the eighteenth century, and by Watt in 1784, was,\r\nat the end of the century, tried experimentally in the United States\r\nby David Bushnell, an ingenious American, who was then conducting the\r\nexperiments with torpedoes which were the cause of the incident which\r\noriginated that celebrated song by Francis Hopkinson, the \"Battle of\r\nthe Kegs,\" using the screw to propel one of his submarine boats, and\r\nby John Fitch, and by Dallery in France.\r\n\r\nJoseph Bramah, of Great Britain, May 9, 1785, patented a\r\nscrew-propeller identical in general arrangement with those used\r\nto-day. His sketch exhibits a screw, apparently of very fair shape,\r\ncarried on an horizontal shaft, which passes out of the vessel through\r\na stuffing-box, the screw being wholly submerged. Bramah does not seem\r\nto have put his plan in practice. It was patented again in England,\r\nalso, by Littleton in 1794, and by Shorter in 1800.\r\n\r\nJohn Stevens, however, first gave the screw a practically useful\r\nform, and used it successfully, in 1804 and 1805, on the single and\r\nthe twin screw boats which he built at that time. This propelling\r\ninstrument was also tried by Trevithick, who planned a vessel to be\r\npropelled by a steam-engine driving a screw, at about this time, and\r\nhis scheme was laid before the Navy Board in the year 1812. His plans\r\nincluded an iron hull. Francis Pettit Smith tried the screw also in\r\nthe year 1808, and subsequently.\r\n\r\nJoseph Ressel, a Bohemian, proposed to use a screw in the propulsion\r\nof balloons, about 1812, and in the year 1826 proposed its use for\r\nmarine propulsion. He is said to have built a screw-boat in the year\r\n1829, at Trieste, which he named the Civetta. The little craft met\r\nwith an accident on the trial-trip, and nothing more was done.\r\n\r\nThe screw was finally brought into general use through the exertions\r\nof John Ericsson, a skillful Swedish engineer, who was residing in\r\nEngland in the year 1836, and of Mr. F. P. Smith, an English farmer.\r\nEricsson patented a peculiar form of screw-propeller, and designed a\r\nsteamer 40 feet in length, of 8 feet beam, and drawing 3 feet of\r\nwater. The screw was double, two shafts being placed the one within\r\nthe other, revolving in opposite directions, and carrying the one a\r\nright-hand and the other a left-hand screw. These screws were 5-1/4\r\nfeet in diameter. On her trial-trip this little steamer attained a\r\nspeed of 10 miles an hour. Its power as a \"tug\" was found to be very\r\nsatisfactory; it towed a schooner of 140 tons burden at the rate of 7\r\nmiles, and the large American packet-ship Toronto was towed on the\r\nThames at a speed of 5 miles an hour.\r\n\r\nEricsson endeavored to interest the British Admiralty in his\r\nimprovements, and succeeded only so far as to induce the Lords of the\r\nAdmiralty to make an excursion with him on the river. No interest was\r\nawakened in the new system, and nothing was done by the naval\r\nauthorities. A note to the inventor from Captain Beaufort--one of the\r\nparty--was received shortly afterward, in which it was stated that\r\nthe excursionists had not found the performance of the little vessel\r\nto equal their hopes and expectations. All the interests of the then\r\nexisting engine-building establishments were opposed to the\r\ninnovation, and the proverbial conservatism of naval men and naval\r\nadministrations aided in procuring the rejection of Ericsson's plans.\r\n\r\nFortunately for the United States, it happened, at that time, that we\r\nhad in Great Britain both civil and naval representatives of greater\r\nintelligence, or of greater boldness and enterprise. The consul at\r\nLiverpool was Mr. Francis B. Ogden, of New Jersey, a gentleman who was\r\nsomewhat familiar with the steam-engine and with steam-navigation. He\r\nhad seen Ericsson's plans at an earlier period, and had at once seen\r\ntheir probable value. He was sufficiently confident of success to\r\nplace capital at the disposal of the inventor. The little screw-boat\r\njust described was built with funds of which he furnished a part, and\r\nwas named, in his honor, the Francis B. Ogden.\r\n\r\nCaptain Robert F. Stockton, an officer of the United States Navy, and\r\nalso a resident of New Jersey, was in London at the time, and made an\r\nexcursion with Ericsson on the Ogden. He was also at once convinced of\r\nthe value of the new method of application of steam-power to\r\nship-propulsion, and gave the engineer an order to build two iron\r\nscrew-steamboats for use in the United States. Ericsson was induced,\r\nby Messrs. Ogden and Stockton, to take up his residence in the United\r\nStates.[84] The Stockton was sent over to the United States in April,\r\n1839, under sail, and was sold to the Delaware & Raritan Canal\r\nCompany. Her name was changed, and, as the New Jersey, she remained in\r\nservice many years.\r\n\r\n  [84] This distinguished inventor is still a resident of New York\r\n  (1878).\r\n\r\nThe success of the boat built by Ericsson was so evident that,\r\nalthough the naval authorities remained inactive, a private company\r\nwas formed, in 1839, to work the patents of F. P. Smith, and this\r\n\"Ship-Propeller Company\" built an experimental craft called the\r\nArchimedes, and its trial-trip was made October 14th of the same year.\r\nThe speed attained was 9.64 miles an hour. The result was in every\r\nrespect satisfactory, and the vessel, subsequently, made many voyages\r\nfrom port to port, and finally circumnavigated the island of Great\r\nBritain. The proprietors of the ship were not pecuniarily successful\r\nin their venture, however, and the sale of the vessel left the company\r\na heavy loser. The Archimedes was 125 feet long, of 21 feet 10 inches\r\nbeam, and 10 feet draught, registering 232 tons. The engines were\r\nrated at 80 horse-power. Smith's earlier experiments (1837) were made\r\nwith a little craft of 6 tons burden, driven by an engine having a\r\nsteam-cylinder 6 inches in diameter and 15 inches stroke of piston.\r\nThe funds needed were furnished by a London banker--Mr. Wright.\r\n\r\nBennett Woodcroft had also used the screw experimentally as early as\r\n1832, on the Irwell, near Manchester, England, in a boat of 55 tons\r\nburden. Twin-screws were used, right and left handed respectively;\r\nthey were each two feet in diameter, and were given an expanding\r\npitch. The boat attained a speed of four miles an hour.\r\n\r\nExperiments made subsequently (1843) with this form of screw, and in\r\ncompetition with the \"true\" screw of Smith, brought out very\r\ndistinctly the superiority of the former, and gave some knowledge of\r\nthe proper proportions for maximum efficiency. In later examples of\r\nthe Woodcroft screw, the blades were made detachable and adjustable--a\r\nplan which is still a usual one, and which has proved to be, in some\r\nrespects, very convenient.\r\n\r\nWhen Ericsson reached the United States, he was almost\r\nimmediately given an opportunity to build the Princeton--a large\r\nscrew-steamer--and at about the same time the English and French\r\nGovernments also had screw-steamers built from his plans, or from\r\nthose of his agent in England, the Count de Rosen. In these latter\r\nships--the Amphion and the Pomona--the first horizontal direct-acting\r\nengines ever built were used, and they were fitted with double-acting\r\nair-pumps, having canvas valves and other novel features. The great\r\nadvantages exhibited by these vessels over the paddle-steamers of the\r\ntime did for screw-propulsion what Stephenson's locomotive--the\r\nRocket--did for railroad locomotion ten years earlier.\r\n\r\nCongress, in 1839, had authorized the construction of three\r\nwar-vessels, and the Secretary of the Navy ordered that two be at once\r\nbuilt in the succeeding year. Of these, one was the Princeton, the\r\nscrew-steamer of which the machinery was designed by Ericsson. The\r\nlength of this vessel was 164 feet, beam 30-1/2 feet, and depth 21-1/2\r\nfeet. The ship drew from 16-1/2 to 18 feet of water, displacing at\r\nthose draughts 950 and 1,050 tons. The hull had a broad, flat floor,\r\nwith sharp entrance and fine run, and the lines were considered at\r\nthat time remarkably fine.\r\n\r\nThe screw was of gun-bronze, six-bladed, and was 14 feet in diameter\r\nand of 35 feet pitch; i. e., were there no slip, the screw working as\r\nif in a solid nut, the ship would have been driven forward 35 feet at\r\neach revolution.\r\n\r\nThe engines were two in number, and very peculiar in form; the\r\ncylinder was, in fact, a _semi_-cylinder, and the place of the\r\npiston-rod, as usually built, was taken by a vibrating shaft, or\r\n\"rock-shaft,\" which carried a piston of rectangular form, and which\r\nvibrated like a door on its hinges as the steam was alternately let\r\ninto and exhausted from each side of it. The great rock-shaft carried,\r\nat the outer end, an arm from which a connecting-rod led to the crank,\r\nthus forming a \"direct-acting engine.\"\r\n\r\nThe draught in the boilers was urged by blowers. Ericsson had adopted\r\nthis method of securing an artificial draught ten years before, in one\r\nof his earlier vessels, the Corsair. The Princeton carried a XII-inch\r\nwrought-iron gun. This gun exploded after a few trials, with terribly\r\ndisastrous results, causing the death of several distinguished men,\r\nincluding members of the President's cabinet.\r\n\r\nThe Princeton proved very successful as a screw-steamer, attaining a\r\nspeed of 13 knots, and was then considered very remarkably fast.\r\nCaptain Stockton, who commanded the vessel, was most enthusiastic in\r\npraise of her.\r\n\r\nImmediately there began a revolution in both civil and naval\r\nship-building, which progressed with great rapidity. The Princeton was\r\nthe first of the screw-propelled navy which has now entirely displaced\r\nthe older type of steam-vessel. The introduction of the screw now took\r\nplace with great rapidity. Six steamers were fitted with Ericsson's\r\nscrew in 1841, 9 in 1842, and nearly 30 in the year 1843.\r\n\r\nIn Great Britain, France, Germany, and other European countries, the\r\nrevolution was also finally effected, and was equally complete. Nearly\r\nall sea-going vessels built toward the close of the period here\r\nconsidered were screw-steamers, fitted with direct-acting,\r\nquick-working engines. It was, however, many years before the\r\nexperience of engineers in the designing and in the construction and\r\nmanagement of this new machinery enabled them to properly proportion\r\nit for the various kinds of service to which they were called upon to\r\nadapt it. Among other modifications of earlier practice introduced by\r\nEricsson was the surface-condenser with a circulating pump driven by a\r\nsmall independent engine.\r\n\r\nThe screw was found to possess many advantages over the paddle-wheel\r\nas an instrument for ship-propulsion. The cost of machinery was\r\ngreatly reduced by its use; the expense of maintenance in working\r\norder was, however, somewhat increased. The latter disadvantage was,\r\nnevertheless, much more than compensated by an immense increase in the\r\neconomy of ship-propulsion, which marked the substitution of the new\r\ninstrument and its impelling machinery.\r\n\r\nWhen a ship is propelled by paddles, the motion of the vessel creates,\r\nin consequence of the friction of the fluid against the sides and\r\nbottom, a current of water which flows in the direction in which the\r\nship is moving, and forms a current following the ship for a time, and\r\nfinally losing all motion by contact with the surrounding mass of\r\nwater. All the power expended in the production of this great stream\r\nis, in the case of the paddle-steamer, entirely lost. In\r\nscrew-steamers, however, the propelling instrument works in this\r\nfollowing current, and the tendency of its action is to bring the\r\nagitated fluid to rest, taking up and thus restoring, usefully, a\r\nlarge part of that energy which would otherwise have been lost. The\r\nscrew is also completely covered by the water, and acts with\r\ncomparative efficiency in consequence of its submersion. The rotation\r\nof the screw is comparatively rapid and smooth, also, and this permits\r\nthe use of small, light, fast-running engines. The latter condition\r\nleads to economy of weight and space, and consequently saves not only\r\nthe cost of transportation of the excess of weight of the larger kind\r\nof engine, but, leaving so much more room for paying cargo, the gain\r\nis found to be a double one. Still further, the quick-running engine\r\nis, other things being equal, the most economical of steam; and thus\r\nsome expense is saved not only in the purchase of fuel, but in its\r\ntransportation, and some still additional gain is derived from the\r\nincreased amount of paying cargo which the vessel is thus enabled to\r\ncarry. The change here described was thus found to be productive of\r\nenormous direct gain. Indirectly, also, some advantage was derived\r\nfrom the greater convenience of a deck clear from machinery and the\r\ngreat paddle-shaft, in the better storage of the lading, the greater\r\nfacility with which the masts and sails could be fitted and used; and\r\ndirectly, again, in clear sides unencumbered by great paddle-boxes\r\nwhich impeded the vessel by catching both sea and wind.\r\n\r\nThe screw was, for some years, generally regarded as simply auxiliary\r\nin large vessels, assisting the sails. Ultimately the screw became\r\nthe essential feature, and vessels were lightly sparred and were given\r\nsmaller areas of sail, the latter becoming the auxiliary power.\r\n\r\nIn November of the year 1843, the screw-steamer Midas, Captain Poor, a\r\nsmall schooner-rigged craft, left New York for China, on probably the\r\nfirst voyage of such length ever undertaken by a steamer; and in the\r\nfollowing January the Edith, Captain Lewis, a bark-rigged\r\nscrew-vessel, sailed from the same port for India and China. The\r\nMassachusetts, Captain Forbes, a screw-steamship of about 800 tons,\r\nsailed for Liverpool September 15, 1845, the first voyage of an\r\nAmerican transatlantic passenger-steamer since the Savannah's pioneer\r\nadventure a quarter of a century before. Two years later, American\r\nenterprise had placed both screw and paddle steamers on the rivers of\r\nChina--principally through the exertions of Captain R. B. Forbes--and\r\nsteam-navigation was fairly established throughout the world.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the screw-steamer of the present time with the best\r\nexamples of steamers propelled by paddle-wheels, the superiority of\r\nthe former is so marked that it may cause some surprise that the\r\nrevolution just described should have progressed no more rapidly. The\r\nreason of this slow progress, however, was probably that the\r\nintroduction of the rapidly-revolving screw, in place of the\r\nslow-moving paddle-wheel, necessitated a complete revolution in the\r\ndesign of their steam-engines; and the unavoidable change from the\r\nheavy, long-stroked, low-speed engines previously in use, to the light\r\nengines, with small cylinders and high piston-speed, called for by the\r\nnew system of propulsion, was one that necessarily occurred slowly,\r\nand was accompanied by its share of those engineering blunders and\r\naccidents that invariably take place during such periods of\r\ntransition. Engineers had first to learn to design such engines\r\nas should be reliable under the then novel conditions of\r\nscrew-propulsion, and their experience could only be gained through\r\nthe occurrence of many mishaps and costly failures. The best\r\nproportions of engines and screws, for a given ship, were determined\r\nonly by long experience, although great assistance was derived from\r\nthe extensive series of experiments made with the French steamer\r\nPelican. It also became necessary to train up a body of engine-drivers\r\nwho should be capable of managing these new engines; for they required\r\nthe exercise of a then unprecedented amount of care and skill.\r\nFinally, with the accomplishment of these two requisites to success\r\nmust simultaneously occur the enlightenment of the public,\r\nprofessional as well as non-professional, in regard to their\r\nadvantages. Thus it happens that it is only after a considerable time\r\nthat the screw attained its proper place as an instrument of\r\npropulsion, and finally drove the paddle-wheel quite out of use,\r\nexcept in shoal water.\r\n\r\nNow our large screw-steamers are of higher speed than any\r\npaddle-steamers on the ocean, and develop their power at far less\r\ncost. This increased economy is due not only to the use of a more\r\nefficient propelling instrument, and to changes already described, but\r\nalso, in a great degree, to the economy which has followed as a\r\nconsequence of other changes in the steam-engine driving it. The\r\nearliest days of screw-propulsion witnessed the use of steam of from 5\r\nto 15 pounds pressure, in a geared engine using jet-condensation, and\r\ngiving a horse-power at an expense of perhaps 7 to 10, or even more,\r\npounds of coal per hour. A little later came direct-acting engines\r\nwith jet-condensation and steam at 20 pounds pressure, costing about 5\r\nor 6 pounds per horse-power per hour. The steam-pressure rose a little\r\nhigher with the use of greater expansion, and the economy of fuel was\r\nfurther improved. The introduction of the surface-condenser, which\r\nbegan to be generally adopted some ten years ago, brought down the\r\ncost of power to from 3 to 4 pounds in the better class of engines. At\r\nabout the same time, this change to surface-condensation helping\r\ngreatly to overcome those troubles arising from boiler-incrustation\r\nwhich had prevented the rise of steam-pressure above about 25 pounds\r\nper square inch, and as, at the same time, it was learned by engineers\r\nthat the deposit of lime-scale in the marine boiler was determined by\r\ntemperature rather than by the degree of concentration, and that all\r\nthe lime entering the boiler was deposited at the pressure just\r\nmentioned, a sudden advance took place. Careful design, good\r\nworkmanship, and skillful management, made the surface-condenser an\r\nefficient apparatus; and, the dangers of incrustation being thus\r\nlessened, the movement toward higher pressures recommenced, and\r\nprogressed so rapidly that now 75 pounds per square inch is very\r\nusual, and more than 125 pounds has since been attained.\r\n\r\nThe close of this period was marked by the construction of the most\r\nsuccessful types of paddle-steamers, the complete success of\r\ntransoceanic steam-transportation, the introduction of the\r\nscrew-propeller and the peculiar engine appropriate to it, and,\r\nfinally, a general improvement, which had finally become marked both\r\nin direction and in rapidity of movement, leading toward the use of\r\nhigher steam-pressure, greater expansion, lighter and more\r\nrapidly-working machinery, and decidedly better design and\r\nconstruction, and the use of better material. The result of these\r\nchanges was seen in economy of first cost and maintenance, and the\r\nability to attain greater speed, and to assure greater safety to\r\npassengers and less risk to cargo.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the changes just noted finally led to the last\r\ngreat change in the form of the marine steam-engine, and a revolution\r\nwas inaugurated, which, however, only became complete in the\r\nsucceeding period. The non-success of Hornblower and of Wolff, and\r\nothers who had attempted to introduce the \"compound\" or\r\ndouble-cylinder engine on land, had not convinced all engineers that\r\nit might not yet be made a successful rival of the then standard type;\r\nand the three or four steamers which were built for the Hudson River\r\nat the end of the first quarter of the nineteenth century are said to\r\nhave been very successful vessels. Carrying 75 to 100 pounds of steam\r\nin their boilers, the Swiftsure and her contemporaries were by that\r\ncircumstance well fitted to make that form of engine economically a\r\nsuccess. This form of engine was built occasionally during the\r\nsucceeding quarter of a century, but only became a recognized standard\r\ntype after the close of the epoch to the history of which this chapter\r\nis devoted. That latest and greatest advance in the direction of\r\nincreased efficiency in the marine steam-engine was, however,\r\ncommenced very soon after Watt's death, and its completion was the\r\nwork of nearly a half-century.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VI.\r\n\r\n_THE STEAM-ENGINE OF TO-DAY._\r\n\r\n  ... \"And, last of all, with inimitable power, and 'with whirlwind\r\n  sound,' comes the potent agency of steam. In comparison with the\r\n  past, what centuries of improvement has this single agent comprised\r\n  in the short compass of fifty years! Everywhere practicable,\r\n  everywhere efficient, it has an arm a thousand times stronger than\r\n  that of Hercules, and to which human ingenuity is capable of fitting\r\n  a thousand times as many hands as belonged to Briareus. Steam is\r\n  found in triumphant operation on the seas; and, under the influence\r\n  of its strong propulsion, the gallant ship--\r\n\r\n    'Against the wind, against the tide,\r\n    Still steadies with an upright keel.'\r\n\r\n  It is on the rivers, and the boatman may repose on his oars; it is\r\n  on highways, and exerts itself along the courses of land-conveyance;\r\n  it is at the bottom of mines, a thousand feet below the earth's\r\n  surface; it is in the mills, and in the workshops of the trades. It\r\n  rows, it pumps, it excavates, it carries, it draws, it lifts, it\r\n  hammers, it spins, it weaves, it prints. It seems to say to men, at\r\n  least to the class of artisans: 'Leave off your manual labor; give\r\n  over your bodily toil; bestow but your skill and reason to the\r\n  directing of my power, and I will bear the toil, with no muscle to\r\n  grow weary, no nerve to relax, no breast to feel faintness!' What\r\n  further improvement may still be made in the use of this astonishing\r\n  power it is impossible to know, and it were vain to conjecture. What\r\n  we do know is, that it has most essentially altered the face of\r\n  affairs, and that no visible limit yet appears beyond which its\r\n  progress is seen to be impossible.\"--DANIEL WEBSTER.\r\n\r\n\r\nTHE PERIOD OF REFINEMENT--1850 TO DATE.\r\n\r\nBy the middle of the present century, as we have now seen, the\r\nsteam-engine had been applied, and successfully, to every great\r\npurpose for which it was fitted. Its first application was to the\r\nelevation of water; it next was applied to the driving of mills and\r\nmachinery; and it finally became the great propelling power in\r\ntransportation by land and by sea.\r\n\r\nAt the beginning of the period to which we are now come, these\r\napplications of steam-power had become familiar both to the engineer\r\nand to the public. The forms of engine adapted to each purpose had\r\nbeen determined, and had become usually standard. Every type of the\r\nmodern steam-engine had assumed, more or less closely, the form and\r\nproportions which are now familiar; and the most intelligent designers\r\nand builders had been taught--by experience rather than by theory, for\r\nthe theory of the steam-engine had then been but little investigated,\r\nand the principles and laws of thermo-dynamics had not been traced in\r\ntheir application to this engine--the principles of construction\r\nessential to successful practice, and were gradually learning the\r\nrelative standing of the many forms of steam-engine, from among which\r\nhave been preserved a few specially fitted for certain specific\r\nmethods of utilization of power.\r\n\r\nDuring the years succeeding the date 1850, therefore, the growth of\r\nthe steam-engine had been, not a change of standard type, or the\r\naddition of new parts, but a gradual improvement in forms,\r\nproportions, and arrangements of details; and this period has been\r\nmarked by the dying out of the forms of engine least fitted to succeed\r\nin competition with others, and the retention of the latter has been\r\nan example of \"the survival of the fittest.\" This has therefore been a\r\nPeriod of Refinement.\r\n\r\nDuring this period invention has been confined to details; it has\r\nproduced new forms of parts, new arrangements of details; it has\r\ndevised an immense variety of valves, valve-motions, regulating\r\napparatus, and a still greater variety of steam-boilers and of\r\nattachments, essential and non-essential, to both engines and boilers.\r\nThe great majority of these peculiar devices have been of no value,\r\nand very many of the best of them have been found to have about equal\r\nvalue. All the well-known and successful forms of engine, when equally\r\nwell designed and constructed and equally well managed, are of very\r\nnearly equal efficiency; all of the best-known types of steam-boiler,\r\nwhere given equal proportions of grate to heating-surface and equally\r\nwell designed, with a view to securing a good draught and a good\r\ncirculation of water, have been found to give very nearly equally good\r\nresults; and it has become evident that a good knowledge of principles\r\nand of practice, on the part of the designer, the constructor, and the\r\nmanager of the boiler, is essential in the endeavor to achieve\r\neconomical success; that good engineering is demanded, rather than\r\ngreat ingenuity. The inventor has been superseded here by the\r\nengineer.\r\n\r\nThe knowledge acquired in the time of Watt, of the essential\r\nprinciples of steam-engine construction, has since become generally\r\nfamiliar to the better class of engineers. It has led to the selection\r\nof simple, strong, and durable forms of engine and boiler, to the\r\nintroduction of various kinds of valves and of valve-gearing, capable\r\nof adjustment to any desired range of expansive working, and to the\r\nattachment of efficient forms of governor to regulate the speed of the\r\nengine, by determining automatically the point of cut-off which will,\r\nat any instant, best adjust the energy exerted by the expanding steam\r\nto the demand made by the work to be done.\r\n\r\nThe value of high pressures and considerable expansion was recognized\r\nas long ago as in the early part of the present century, and Watt, by\r\ncombining skillfully the several principal parts of the steam-engine,\r\ngave it very nearly the shape which it has to-day. The compound\r\nengine, even, as has been seen, was invented by contemporaries of\r\nWatt, and the only important modifications since his time have\r\noccurred in details. The introduction of the \"drop cut-off,\" the\r\nattachment of the governor to the expansion-apparatus in such a manner\r\nas to determine the degree of expansion, the improvement of\r\nproportions, the introduction of higher steam and greater expansion,\r\nthe improvement of the marine engine by the adoption of\r\nsurface-condensation, in addition to these other changes, and the\r\nintroduction of the double-cylinder engine, after the elevation of\r\nsteam-pressure and increase of expansion had gone so far as to justify\r\nits use, are the changes, therefore, which have taken place during\r\nthis last quarter-century. It began then to be generally understood\r\nthat expansion of steam produced economy, and mechanics and inventors\r\nvied with each other in the effort to obtain a form of valve-gear\r\nwhich should secure the immense saving which an abstract consideration\r\nof the expansion of gases according to Marriotte's law would seem to\r\npromise. The counteracting phenomena of internal condensation and\r\nreevaporation, of the losses of heat externally and internally, and of\r\nthe effect of defective vacuum, defective distribution of steam, and\r\nof back-pressure, were either unobserved or were entirely overlooked.\r\n\r\nIt was many years, therefore, before engine-builders became convinced\r\nthat no improvement upon existing forms of expansion-gear could secure\r\neven an approximation to theoretical efficiency.\r\n\r\nThe fact thus learned, that the benefit of expansive working has a\r\nlimit which is very soon reached in ordinary practice, was not then,\r\nand has only recently become, generally known among our steam-engine\r\nbuilders, and for several years, during the period upon which we now\r\nenter, there continued the keenest competition between makers of rival\r\nforms of expansion-gear, and inventors were continually endeavoring to\r\nproduce something which should far excel any previously-existing\r\ndevice.\r\n\r\nIn Europe, as in the United States, efforts to \"improve\" standard\r\ndesigns have usually resulted in injuring their efficiency, and in\r\nsimply adding to the first cost and running expense of the engines,\r\nwithout securing a marked increase in economy in the consumption of\r\nsteam.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION I.--STATIONARY ENGINES.\r\n\r\n\"STATIONARY ENGINES\" had been applied to the operation of\r\nmill-machinery, as has been seen, by Watt and by Murdoch, his\r\nassistant and pupil; and Watt's competitors, in Great Britain and\r\nabroad, had made considerable progress before the death of the great\r\nengineer, in its adaptation to its work. In the United States, Oliver\r\nEvans had introduced the non-condensing high-pressure stationary\r\nengine, which was the progenitor of the standard engine of that type\r\nwhich is now used far more generally than any other form. These\r\nengines were at first rude in design, badly proportioned, rough and\r\ninaccurate as to workmanship, and uneconomical in their consumption of\r\nfuel. Gradually, however, when made by reputable builders, they\r\nassumed neat and strong shapes, good proportions, and were well made\r\nand of excellent materials, doing their work with comparatively little\r\nwaste of heat or of fuel.\r\n\r\nOne of the neatest and best modern designs of stationary engine for\r\nsmall powers is seen in Fig. 93, which represents a \"vertical\r\ndirect-acting engine,\" with base-plate--a form which is a favorite\r\nwith many engineers.\r\n\r\nThe engine shown in the engraving consists of two principal parts, the\r\ncylinder and the frame, which is a tapering column having openings in\r\nthe sides, to allow free access to all the working parts within. The\r\nslides and pillow-blocks are cast with the column, so that they cannot\r\nbecome loose or out of line; the rubbing surfaces are large and easily\r\nlubricated. Owing to the vertical position, there is no tendency to\r\nside wear of cylinder or piston. The packing-rings are self-adjusting,\r\nand work free but tight. The crank is counterbalanced; the crank-pin,\r\ncross-head pin, piston-rod, valve-stem, etc., are made of steel; all\r\nthe bearing surfaces are made extra large, and are accurately fitted;\r\nand the best quality of Babbitt-metal only used for the\r\njournal-bearings.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 93.--Vertical Stationary Steam-Engine.]\r\n\r\nThe smaller sizes of these engines, from 2 to 10 horse-power, have\r\nboth pillow-blocks cast in the frame, giving a bearing each side of\r\nthe double cranks. They are built by some constructors in quantities,\r\nand parts duplicated by special machinery (as in fire-arms and\r\nsewing-machines), which secures great accuracy and uniformity of\r\nworkmanship, and allows of any part being quickly and cheaply\r\nreplaced, when worn or broken by accident. The next figure is a\r\nvertical section through the same engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 94.--Vertical Stationary Steam-Engine. Section.]\r\n\r\nEngines fitted with the ordinary rigid bearings require to be erected\r\non a firm foundation, and to be kept in perfect line. If, by the\r\nsettling of the foundation, or from any other cause, they get out of\r\nline, heating, cutting, and thumping result. To obviate this, modern\r\nengines are often fitted with self-adjusting bearings throughout; this\r\ngives the engine great flexibility and freedom from friction. The\r\naccompanying cuts show clearly how this is accomplished. The\r\npillow-block has a spherical shell turned and fitted into the\r\nspherically-bored pillow-block, thus allowing a slight angular motion\r\nin any direction. The connecting-rod is forged in a single piece,\r\nwithout straps, gibs, or key, and is mortised through at each end for\r\nthe reception of the brass boxes, which are curved on their backs, and\r\nfit the cheek-pieces, between which they can turn to adjust themselves\r\nto the pins, in the plane of the axis of the rod. The adjustment for\r\nwear is made by wedge-blocks and set screws, as shown, and they are so\r\nconstructed that the parts cannot get loose and cause a break-down.\r\nThe cross-head has adjustable gibs on each side, turned to fit the\r\nslides, which are cast solidly in the frame, and bored out exactly in\r\nthe line with the cylinder. This permits it freely to turn on its\r\naxis, and, in connection with the adjustable boxes in the\r\nconnecting-rod, allows a perfect self-adjustment to the line of the\r\ncrank-pin. The out-board bearing may be moved an inch or more out of\r\nposition in any direction, without detriment to the running of the\r\nengine, all bearings accommodating themselves perfectly to whatever\r\nposition the shaft may assume.\r\n\r\nThe ports and valve-passages are proportioned as in locomotive\r\npractice. The valve-seat is adapted to the ordinary plain slide or\r\nD-valve, should it be preferred, but the balanced piston slide-valve\r\nworks with equal ease whether the steam-pressure is 10 or 100 pounds,\r\nand at the same time gives double steam and exhaust openings, which\r\ngreatly facilitates the entrance of the steam to, and its escape from,\r\nthe cylinder, thus securing a nearer approach to boiler-pressure and a\r\nless back-pressure, saving the power required to work an ordinary\r\nvalve, and reducing the wear of valve-gear.\r\n\r\nThis is a type of engine frequently seen in the United States, but\r\nmore rarely in Europe. It is an excellent form of engine. The vertical\r\ndirect-acting engine is sometimes, though rarely, built of very\r\nconsiderable size, and these large engines are more frequently seen in\r\nrolling-mills than elsewhere.\r\n\r\nWhere much power is required, the stationary engine is usually an\r\nhorizontal direct-acting engine, having a more or less effective\r\ncut-off valve-gear, according to the size of engine and the cost of\r\nfuel. A good example of the simpler form of this kind of engine is the\r\nsmall horizontal slide-valve engine, with independent cut-off valve\r\nriding on the back of the main valve--a combination generally known\r\namong engineers as the Meyer system of valve-gear. This form of\r\nsteam-engine is a very effective machine, and does excellent work when\r\nproperly proportioned to yield the required amount of power. It is\r\nwell adapted to an expansion of from four to five times. Its\r\ndisadvantages are the difficulty which it presents in the attachment\r\nof the regulator, to determine the point of cut-off by the heavy work\r\nwhich it throws upon the governor when attached, and the rather\r\ninflexible character of the device as an expansive valve-gear. The\r\nbest examples of this class of engine have neat heavy bed-plates,\r\nwell-designed cylinders and details, smooth-working valve-gear, the\r\nexpansion-valve adjusted by a right and left hand screw, and\r\nregulation secured by the attachment of the governor to the\r\nthrottle-valve.\r\n\r\nThe engine shown in the accompanying illustration (Fig. 95) is an\r\nexample of an excellent British stationary steam-engine. It is simple,\r\nstrong, and efficient. The frame, front cylinder-head, cross-head\r\nguides, and crank-shaft \"plumber-block,\" are cast in one piece, as has\r\nso generally been done in the United States for a long time by some of\r\nour manufacturers. The cylinder is secured against the end of the\r\nbed-plate, as was first done by Corliss. The crank-pin is set in a\r\ncounterbalanced disk. The valve-gear is simple, and the governor\r\neffective, and provided with a safety-device to prevent injury by the\r\nbreaking of the governor-belt. An engine of this kind of 10 inches\r\ndiameter of cylinder, 20 inches stroke of piston, is rated by the\r\nbuilders at about 25 horse-power; a similar engine 30 inches in\r\ndiameter of cylinder would yield from 225 to 250 horse-power. In\r\nthis example, all parts are made to exact size by gauges standardized\r\nto Whitworth's sizes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 95.--Horizontal Stationary Steam-Engine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 96.--Horizontal Stationary Steam-Engine.]\r\n\r\nIn American engines (as is seen in Fig. 96), usually, two supports are\r\nplaced--the one under the latter bearing, and the other under the\r\ncylinder--to take the weight of the engine; and through them it is\r\nsecured to the foundation. As in the vertical engine already\r\ndescribed, a valve is sometimes used, consisting of two pistons\r\nconnected by a rod, and worked by an ordinary eccentric. By a simple\r\narrangement these pistons have always the same pressure inside as out,\r\nwhich prevents any leakage or blowing through; and they are said\r\nalways to work equally as well and free from friction under 150 pounds\r\npressure as under 10 pounds per square inch, and to require no\r\nadjustment. It is more usual, however, to adopt the three-ported valve\r\nused on locomotives, with (frequently) a cut-off valve on the back of\r\nthis main valve, which cut-off valve is adjusted either by hand or by\r\nthe governor.\r\n\r\nEngines of the class just described are especially well fitted, by\r\ntheir simplicity, compactness, and solidity, to work at the high\r\npiston-speeds which are gradually becoming generally adopted in the\r\neffort to attain increased economy of fuel by the reduction of the\r\nimmense losses of heat which occur in the expansion of steam in the\r\nmetallic cylinders through which we are now compelled to work it.\r\n\r\nOne of the best known of recent engines is the Allen engine, a\r\nsteam-engine having the same general arrangement of parts seen in the\r\nabove illustration, but fitted with a peculiar valve-gear, and having\r\nproportions of parts which are especially calculated to secure\r\nsmoothness of motion and uniformity of pressure on crank-pin and\r\njournals, at speeds so high that the inertia of the reciprocating\r\nparts becomes a seriously-important element in the calculation of the\r\ndistribution of stresses and their effect on the dynamics of the\r\nmachine.\r\n\r\nIn the Allen engine,[85] the cylinder and frame are connected as in\r\nthe engine seen above, and the crank-disk, shaft-bearings, and other\r\nprincipal details, are not essentially different. The valve-gear[86]\r\ndiffers in having four valves, one at each end on the steam as well as\r\non the exhaust side, all of which are balanced and work with very\r\nlittle resistance. These valves are not detachable, but are driven by\r\na link attached to and moved by an eccentric on the main shaft, the\r\nposition of the valve-rod attachment to which link is determined by\r\nthe governor, and the degree of expansion is thus adjusted to the work\r\nof the engine. The engine has usually a short stroke, not exceeding\r\ntwice the diameter of cylinder, and is driven at very high speed,\r\ngenerally averaging from 600 to 800 feet per minute.[87] This high\r\npiston-speed and short stroke give very great velocity of rotation.\r\nThe effect is, therefore, to produce an exceptional smoothness of\r\nmotion, while permitting the use of small fly-wheels. Its short stroke\r\nenables entire solidity to be attained in a bed of rigid form, making\r\nit a very completely self-contained engine, adapted to the heaviest\r\nwork, and requiring only a small foundation.\r\n\r\n  [85] The invention of Messrs. Charles T. Porter and John F. Allen.\r\n\r\n  [86] Invented by Mr. John F. Allen.\r\n\r\n  [87] Or not far from 600 times the cube root of the length of\r\n  stroke, measured in feet.\r\n\r\nThe journals of the shaft, and all cylindrical wearing surfaces, are\r\nfinished by grinding in a manner that leaves them perfectly round. The\r\ncrank-pin and cross-head pin are hardened before being ground. The\r\njoints of the valve-gear consist of pins turning in solid ferrules in\r\nthe rod-ends, both hardened and ground. After years of constant use\r\nthus, no wear occasioning lost time in the valve-movements has been\r\ndetected.\r\n\r\nHigh speed and short strokes are essential elements of economy. It is\r\nnow well understood that all the surfaces with which the steam comes\r\nin contact condense it.\r\n\r\nObviously, one way to diminish this loss is to reduce the extent of\r\nsurface to which the steam is exposed. In engines of high speed and\r\nshort stroke, the surfaces with which the steam comes in contact,\r\nwhile doing a given amount of work, present less area than in ordinary\r\nengines running at low speed. Where great steadiness of motion is\r\ndesired, the expense of coupled engines is often incurred.\r\nQuick-running engines do not require to be coupled; a single engine\r\nmay give greater uniformity of motion than is usually obtained with\r\ncoupled engines at ordinary speeds. The ports and valve-movements, the\r\nweight of the reciprocating parts, and the size and weight of the\r\nfly-wheels, should be calculated expressly for the speeds chosen.\r\n\r\nThe economy of the engine here described is unexcelled by the best of\r\nthe more familiar \"drop cut-off\" engines.\r\n\r\nAn engine reported upon by a committee of the American Institute, of\r\nwhich Dr. Barnard was chairman, was non-condensing, 16 inches in\r\ndiameter of cylinder, 30 inches stroke, making 125 revolutions per\r\nminute, and developed over 125 horse-power with 75 pounds of steam in\r\nthe boiler, using 25-3/4 pounds of steam per indicated horse-power,\r\nand 2.87 pounds of coal--an extraordinarily good performance for an\r\nengine of such small power.\r\n\r\nThe governor used on this engine is known as the Porter governor. It\r\nis given great power and delicacy by weighting it down, and thus\r\nobtaining a high velocity of rotation, and by suspending the balls\r\nfrom forked arms, which are given each two bearing-pins separated\r\nlaterally so far as to permit considerable force to be exerted in\r\nchanging speeds without cramping those bearings sufficiently to\r\nseriously impair the sensitiveness of the governor. This engine as a\r\nwhole may be regarded as a good representative of the high-speed\r\nengine of to-day.\r\n\r\nSince this change in the direction of high speeds has already gone so\r\nfar that the \"drop cut-off\" is sometimes inapplicable, in consequence\r\nof the fact that the piston would, were such a valve-gear adopted,\r\nreach the end of its stroke before the detached valve could reach its\r\nseat; and since this progress is only limited by our attainments in\r\nmechanical skill and accuracy, it seems probable that the\r\n\"positive-motion expansion-gear\" type of engine will ultimately\r\nsupersede the now standard \"drop cut-off engine.\"\r\n\r\nThe best known and most generally used class of stationary engines at\r\nthe present time is, however, that which has the so-called \"drop\r\ncut-off,\" or \"detachable valve-gear.\" The oldest well-known form of\r\nvalve-motion of this description now in use is that known as the\r\nSickels cut-off, patented by Frederick E. Sickels, an American\r\nmechanic, about the year 1841, and also built by Hogg, of New York,\r\nwho placed it upon the engine of the steamer South America. The\r\ninvention is claimed for both Hogg and Sickels. It was introduced by\r\nthe inventor in a form which especially adapted it to use with the\r\nbeam-engine used on the Eastern waters of the United States, and was\r\nadapted to stationary engines by Messrs. Thurston, Greene & Co., of\r\nProvidence, R. I., who made use of it for some years before any other\r\nform of \"drop cut-off\" came into general use. The Sickels cut-off\r\nconsisted of a set of steam-valves, usually independent of the\r\nexhaust-valves, and each raised by a catch, which could be thrown out,\r\nat the proper moment, by a wedge with which it came in contact as it\r\nrose with the opening valve. This wedge, or other equivalent device,\r\nwas so adjusted that the valve should be detached and fall to its seat\r\nwhen the piston reached that point in its movement, after taking\r\nsteam, at which expansion was to commence. From this point, no steam\r\nentering the cylinder, the piston was impelled by the expanding vapor.\r\nThe valve was usually the double-poppet. Sickels subsequently invented\r\nwhat was called the \"beam-motion,\" to detach the valve at any point in\r\nthe stroke. As at first arranged, the valve could only be detached\r\nduring the earlier half-stroke, since at mid-stroke the direction of\r\nmotion of the eccentric rod was reversed and the valve began to\r\ndescend. By introducing a \"wiper\" having a motion transverse to that\r\nof the valve and its catch, and by giving this wiper a motion\r\ncoincident with that of the piston by connecting it with the beam or\r\nother part of the engine moving with the piston, he obtained a\r\nkinematic combination which permitted the valve to be detached at any\r\npoint in the stroke, adding a very simple contrivance which enabled\r\nthe attendant to set the wiper so that it should strike the catch at\r\nany time during the forward movement of the \"beam-motion.\"\r\n\r\nOn stationary engines, the point of cut-off was afterward determined\r\nby the governor, which was made to operate the detaching mechanism,\r\nthe combination forming what is sometimes called an \"automatic\"\r\ncut-off. The attachment of the governor so as to determine the degree\r\nof expansion had been proposed before Sickels's time. One of the\r\nearliest of these contrivances was that of Zachariah Allen, in 1834,\r\nusing a cut-off valve independent of the steam-valve. The first to so\r\nattach the governor to a _drop cut-off_ valve-motion was George H.\r\nCorliss, who made it a feature of the Corliss valve-gear in 1849. In\r\nthe year 1855, N. T. Greene introduced a form of expansion-gear, in\r\nwhich he combined the range of the Sickels beam-motion device with the\r\nexpansion-adjustment gained by the attachment of the governor, and\r\nwith the advantages of flat slide-valves at all ports--both steam and\r\nexhaust.\r\n\r\nMany other ingenious forms of expansion valve-gear have been invented,\r\nand several have been introduced, which, properly designed and\r\nproportioned to well-planned engines, and with good construction and\r\nmanagement, should give economical results little if at all inferior\r\nto those just named. Among the most ingenious of these later devices\r\nis that of Babcock & Wilcox, in which a very small auxiliary\r\nsteam-cylinder and piston is employed to throw the cut-off valve over\r\nits port at the instant at which the steam is to be cut off. A very\r\nbeautiful form of isochronous governor is used on this engine, to\r\nregulate the speed of the engine by determining the point of cut-off.\r\n\r\nIn Wright's engine, the expansion is adjusted by the movement, by the\r\nregulator, of cams which operate the steam-valves so that they shall\r\nhold the valve open a longer or shorter time, as required.\r\n\r\nSince compactness and lightness are not as essential as in portable,\r\nlocomotive, and marine engines, the parts are arranged, in stationary\r\nengines, with a view simply to securing efficiency, and the design is\r\ndetermined by circumstances. It was formerly usual to adopt the\r\ncondensing engine in mills, and wherever a stationary engine was\r\nrequired. In Europe generally, and to some extent in the United\r\nStates, where a supply of condensing water is obtainable, condensing\r\nengines and moderate steam-pressures are still employed. But this type\r\nof engine is gradually becoming superseded by the high-pressure\r\ncondensing engine, with considerable expansion, and with an\r\nexpansion-gear in which the point of cut-off is determined by the\r\ngovernor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 97.--Corliss Engine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 98--Corliss Engine Valve-Motion.]\r\n\r\nThe best-known engine of this class is the Corliss engine, which is\r\nvery extensively used in the United States, and which has been copied\r\nvery generally by European builders. Fig. 97 represents the Corliss\r\nengine. The horizontal steam-cylinder is bolted firmly to the end of\r\nthe frame, which is so formed as to transmit the strain to the main\r\njournal with the greatest directness. The frame carries the guides for\r\nthe cross-head, which are both in the same vertical plane. The valves\r\nare four in number, a steam and an exhaust valve being placed at each\r\nend of the steam-cylinder. Short steam-passages are thus secured, and\r\nthis diminution of clearance is a source of some economy. Both sets of\r\nvalves are driven by an eccentric operating a disk or wrist-plate, _E_\r\n(Fig. 98), which vibrates on a pin projecting from the cylinder. Short\r\nlinks reaching from this wrist-plate to the several valves, _D D_, _F\r\nF_, move them with a peculiarly varying motion, opening and closing\r\nthem rapidly, and moving them quite slowly when the port is either\r\nnearly open or almost closed. This effect is ingeniously secured by so\r\nplacing the pins on the wrist-plate that their line of motion becomes\r\nnearly transverse to the direction of the valve-links when the limit\r\nof movement is approached. The links connecting the wrist-plate with\r\nthe arms moving the steam-valves have catches at their extremities,\r\nwhich are disengaged by coming in contact, as the arm swings around\r\nwith the valve-stem, with a cam adjusted by the governor. This\r\nadjustment permits the steam to follow the piston farther when the\r\nengine is caused to \"slow down,\" and thus tends to restore the proper\r\nspeed. It disengages the steam-valve earlier, and expands the steam to\r\na greater extent, when the engine begins to run above the proper\r\nspeed. When the catch is thrown out, the valve is closed by a weight\r\nor a strong spring. To prevent jar when the motion of the valve is\r\nchecked, a \"dash-pot\" is used, invented originally by F. E. Sickels.\r\nThis is a vessel having a nicely-fitted piston, which is received by a\r\n\"cushion\" of water or air when the piston suddenly enters the cylinder\r\nat the end of the valve-movement. In the original water dash-pot of\r\nSickels, the cylinder is vertical, and the plunger or piston descends\r\nupon a small body of water confined in the base of the dash-pot.\r\nCorliss's air dash-pot is now often set horizontally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 99.--Greene Engine.]\r\n\r\nIn the Greene steam-engine (Fig. 99), the valves are four in number,\r\nas in the Corliss. The cut-off gear consists of a bar, _A_, moved by\r\nthe steam-eccentric in a direction parallel with the centre-line of\r\nthe cylinder and nearly coincident as to time with the piston. On this\r\nbar are tappets, _C C_, supported by springs and adjustable in height\r\nby the governor, _G_. These tappets engage the arms _B B_, on the ends\r\nof rock-shafts, _E E_, which move the steam-valves and remain in\r\ncontact with them a longer or shorter time, and holding the valve open\r\nduring a greater or less part of the piston-stroke, as the governor\r\npermits the tappets to rise with diminishing engine-speed, or forces\r\nthem down as speed increases. The exhaust-valves are moved by an\r\nindependent eccentric rod, which is itself moved by an eccentric set,\r\nas is usual with the Corliss and with other engines generally, at\r\nright angles with the crank. This engine, in consequence of the\r\nindependence of the steam-eccentric, and of the contemporary movement\r\nof steam valve-motion and steam-piston, is capable of cutting off at\r\nany point from beginning to nearly the end of the stroke. The usual\r\narrangement, by which steam and exhaust valves are moved by the same\r\neccentric, only permits expansion with the range from the beginning to\r\nhalf-stroke. In the Corliss engine the latter construction is\r\nretained, with the object, in part, of securing a means of closing the\r\nvalve by a \"positive motion,\" should, by any accident, the closing not\r\nbe effected by the weight or spring usually relied upon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 100.--Thurston's Greene-Engine Valve-Gear.]\r\n\r\nThe steam-valve of the Greene engine, as designed by the author, is\r\nseen in Fig. 100, where the valve, _G H_, covering the port, _D_, in\r\nthe steam-cylinder, _A B_, is moved by the rod, _J J_, connected to\r\nthe rock-shaft, _M_, by the arm, _L K_. The line, _K I_, should, when\r\ncarried out, intersect the valve-face at its middle point, under _G_.\r\n\r\nThe characteristics of the American stationary engine, therefore, are\r\nhigh steam-pressure without condensation, an expansion valve-gear with\r\ndrop cut-off adjustable by the governor, high piston-speed, and\r\nlightness combined with strength of construction. The pressure most\r\ncommonly adopted in the boilers which furnish steam to this type of\r\nengine is from 75 to 80 pounds per square inch; but a pressure of 100\r\npounds is not infrequently carried, and the latter pressure may be\r\nregarded as a \"mean maximum,\" corresponding to a pressure of 60 pounds\r\nat about the commencement of the period here considered--1850.\r\n\r\nVery much greater pressures have, however, been adopted by some\r\nmakers, and immensely \"higher steam\" has been experimented with by\r\nseveral engineers. As early as 1823, Jacob Perkins[88] commenced\r\nexperimenting with steam of very great tension. As has already been\r\nstated, the usual pressure at the time of Watt was but a few pounds--5\r\nor 7--in excess of that of the atmosphere. Evans, Trevithick, and\r\nStevens, had previously worked steam at pressures of from 50 to 75\r\npounds per square inch, and pressures on the Western rivers and\r\nelsewhere in the United States had already been raised to 100 or 150\r\npounds, and explosions were becoming alarmingly frequent.\r\n\r\n  [88] Perkins was a native of Newburyport, Mass. He was born July 9,\r\n  1766, and died in London, July 30, 1849. He went to England when\r\n  fifty-two years of age, to introduce his inventions.\r\n\r\nPerkins's experimental apparatus consisted of a copper boiler, of a\r\ncapacity of about one cubic foot, having sides 3 inches in thickness.\r\nIt was closed at the bottom and top, and had five small pipes leading\r\nfrom the upper head. This was placed in a furnace kept at a high\r\ntemperature by a forced combustion. Safety-valves loaded respectively\r\nto 425 and 550 pounds per square inch were placed on each of two of\r\nthe steam-pipes.\r\n\r\nPerkins used the steam generated under these great pressures in a\r\nlittle engine having a piston 2 inches in diameter and a stroke of 1\r\nfoot. It was rated at 10 horse-power.[89]\r\n\r\n  [89] It was when writing of this engine that Stuart wrote, in 1824:\r\n  \"Judging from the rapid strides the steam-engine has made _during\r\n  the last forty years_ to become a universal first-mover, and from\r\n  the experience that has arisen from that extension, we feel\r\n  convinced that every invention which diminishes its size without\r\n  impairing its power brings it a step nearer to the assistance of the\r\n  'world's great laborers,' the husbandman and the peasant, for whom,\r\n  as yet, it performs but little. At present, it is made occasionally\r\n  to tread out the corn. What honors await not that man who may yet\r\n  direct its mighty power to plough, to sow, to harrow, and to reap!\"\r\n  The progress of the steam-engine during those forty years does not\r\n  to-day appear so astounding. The sentiment here expressed has lost\r\n  none of its truth, nevertheless.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1827, Perkins had attained working pressures, in a\r\nsingle-acting, single-cylinder engine, of upward of 800 pounds per\r\nsquare inch. At pressures exceeding 200 pounds, he had much trouble in\r\nsecuring effective lubrication, as all oils charred and decomposed at\r\nthe high temperatures then unavoidably encountered, and he finally\r\nsucceeded in evading this seemingly insurmountable obstacle by using\r\nfor rubbing parts a peculiar alloy which required no lubrication, and\r\nwhich became so beautifully polished, after some wear, that the\r\nfriction was less than where lubricants were used. At these high\r\npressures Perkins seems to have met with no other serious difficulty.\r\nHe condensed the exhaust-steam and returned it to the boiler, but did\r\nnot attempt to create a vacuum in his condenser, and therefore needed\r\nno air-pump. Steam was cut off at one-eighth stroke.\r\n\r\nIn the same year, Perkins made a compound engine on the Woolf plan,\r\nand adopted a pressure of 1,400 pounds, expanding eight times. In\r\nstill another engine, intended for a steam-vessel, Perkins adopted, or\r\nproposed to adopt, 2,000 pounds pressure, cutting off the admission at\r\none-sixteenth, in single-acting engines of 6 inches diameter of\r\ncylinder and 20 inches stroke of piston. The steam did not retain\r\nboiler-pressure at the cylinder, and this engine was only rated at 30\r\nhorse-power.[90]\r\n\r\n  [90] Galloway and Hebert, on the Steam-Engine. London, 1836.\r\n\r\nStuart follows a description of Perkins's work in the improvement of\r\nthe steam-engine and the introduction of steam-artillery by the\r\nremark:\r\n\r\n\" ... No other mechanic of the day has done more to illustrate an\r\nobscure branch of philosophy by a series of difficult, dangerous,\r\nand expensive experiments; no one's labors have been more deserving\r\nof cheering encouragement, and no one has received less. Even in\r\ntheir present state, his experiments are opening new fields for\r\nphilosophical research, and his mechanism bids fair to introduce\r\na new style into the proportions, construction, and form, of\r\nsteam-machinery.\"\r\n\r\nPerkins's experience was no exception to the general rule, which\r\ndenies to nearly all inventors a fair return for the benefits which\r\nthey confer upon mankind.\r\n\r\nAnother engineer, a few years later, was also successful in\r\ncontrolling and working steam under much higher pressures than are\r\neven now in use. This was Dr. Ernst Alban, a distinguished German\r\nengine-builder, of Plau, Mecklenburg, and an admirer of Oliver Evans,\r\nin whose path he, a generation later, advanced far beyond that great\r\npioneer. Writing in 1843, he describes a system of engine and boiler\r\nconstruction, with which he used steam under pressures about equal to\r\nthose experimentally worked by Jacob Perkins, Evans's American\r\nsuccessor. Alban's treatise was translated and printed in Great\r\nBritain,[91] four years later.\r\n\r\n  [91] \"The High-Pressure Steam-Engine,\" etc. By Dr. Ernst Alban.\r\n  Translated by William Pole, F. R. A. S. London, 1847.\r\n\r\nAlban, on one occasion, used steam of 1,000 pounds pressure. His\r\nboilers were similar in general form to the boiler patented by Stevens\r\nin 1805, but the tubes were horizontal instead of vertical. He\r\nevaporated from 8 to 10 pounds of water into steam of 600 to 800\r\npounds pressure with each pound of coal. He states that the\r\ndifficulty met by Perkins--the decomposition of lubricants in the\r\nsteam-cylinder--did not present itself in his experiments, even when\r\nworking steam at a pressure of 600 pounds on the square inch, and he\r\nfound that less lubrication was needed at such high pressures than in\r\nordinary practice. Alban expanded his steam about as much as Evans, in\r\nhis usual practice, carrying a pressure of 150 pounds, and cutting off\r\nat one-third; he adopted greatly increased piston-speed, attaining 300\r\nfeet per minute, at a time when common practice had only reached 200\r\nfeet. He usually built an oscillating engine, and rarely attached a\r\ncondenser. The valve was the locomotive-slide.[92] The stroke was made\r\nshort to secure strength, compactness, cheapness, and high speed of\r\nrotation; but Alban does not seem to have understood the principles\r\ncontrolling the form and proportions of the expansive engine, or the\r\nnecessity of adopting considerable expansion in order to secure\r\neconomy in working steam of great tension, and therefore was,\r\napparently, not aware of the advantages of a long stroke in reducing\r\nlosses by \"dead-space,\" in reducing risk of annoyance by hot journals,\r\nor in enabling high piston-speeds to be adopted. He seems never to\r\nhave attained a sufficiently high speed of piston to become aware that\r\nthe oscillating cylinder cannot be used at speeds perfectly\r\npracticable with the fixed cylinder.\r\n\r\n  [92] Invented by Joseph Maudsley, of London, 1827.\r\n\r\nAlban states that one of his smallest engines, having a cylinder 4-1/2\r\ninches in diameter and 1 foot stroke of piston, with a piston-speed of\r\nbut 140 to 160 feet per minute, developed 4 horse-power, with a\r\nconsumption of 5.3 pounds of coal per hour. This is a good result for\r\nso small an amount of work, and for an engine working at so low a\r\nspeed of piston. An engine of 30 horse-power, also working very\r\nslowly, required but 4.1 pounds of coal per hour per horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe work of Perkins and of Alban, like that of their predecessors,\r\nEvans, Stevens, and Trevithick, was, however, the work of engineers\r\nwho were far ahead of their time. The general practice, up to the time\r\nwhich marked the beginning of the modern \"period of refinement,\" had\r\nbeen but gradually approximating that just described. Higher pressures\r\nwere slowly approached; higher piston-speeds came slowly into use;\r\ngreater expansion was gradually adopted; the causes of losses of heat\r\nwere finally discovered, and steam-jacketing and external\r\nnon-conducting coverings were more and more generally applied as\r\nbuilders became more familiar with their work. The \"compound engine\"\r\nwas now and then adopted; and each experiment, made with higher steam\r\nand greater expansion, was more nearly successful than the last.\r\n\r\nFinally, all these methods of securing economy became recognized, and\r\nthe reasons for their adoption became known. It then remained, as the\r\nfinal step in this progression, to combine all these requisites of\r\neconomical working in a double-cylinder engine, steam-jacketed, well\r\nprotected by non-conducting coverings, working steam of high pressure,\r\nand with considerable expansion at high piston-speed. This is now done\r\nby the best builders.\r\n\r\nOne of the best examples of this type of engine is that constructed by\r\nthe sons of Jacob Perkins, who continued the work of their father\r\nafter his death. Their engines are single-acting, and the small or\r\nhigh-pressure cylinder is placed on the top of the larger or\r\nlow-pressure cylinder. The valves are worked by rotating stems, and\r\nthe loss of heat and burning of packing incident to the use of the\r\ncommon method are thus avoided. The stuffing-boxes are placed at the\r\nend of long sleeves, closely surrounding the vertical valve-stems\r\nalso, and the water of condensation which collects in these sleeves is\r\nan additional and thorough protection against excessively high\r\ntemperature at the packing. The piston-rings are made of the alloy\r\nwhich has been found to require no lubrication.\r\n\r\nSteam is usually worked at from 250 to 450 pounds, and is generated in\r\nboilers composed of small tubes three inches in diameter and\r\nthree-eighths of an inch thick, which are tested under a pressure of\r\n2,500 pounds per square inch. The safety-valve is usually loaded to\r\n400 pounds. The boiler is fed with distilled water, obtained\r\nprincipally by condensation of the exhaust-steam, any deficiency being\r\nmade up by the addition of water from a distilling apparatus. Under\r\nthese conditions, but 1-1/4 pound of coal is consumed per hour and per\r\nhorse-power.\r\n\r\nTHE PUMPING-ENGINE in use at the present time has passed through a\r\nseries of changes not differing much from that which has been traced\r\nwith the stationary mill-engine. The Cornish engine is still used to\r\nsome extent for supplying water to towns, and is retained at deep\r\nmines. The modern Cornish engine differs very little from that of the\r\ntime of Watt, except in the proportions of parts and the form of its\r\ndetails. Steam-pressures are carried which were never reached during\r\nthe preceding period, and, by careful adjustment of well-set and\r\nwell-proportioned valves and gearing, the engine has been made to work\r\nrather more rapidly, and to do considerably more work. It still\r\nremains, however, a large, costly, and awkward contrivance, requiring\r\nexpensive foundations, and demanding exceptional care, skill, and\r\nexperience in management. It is gradually going out of use. This\r\nengine, as now constructed by good builders, is shown in section in\r\nFig. 101.\r\n\r\nA comparison with the Watt engine of a century earlier will at once\r\nenable any one to appreciate the extent to which changes may be made\r\nin perfecting a machine, even after it has become complete, so far as\r\nsupplying it with all essential parts can complete it.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 101.--Cornish Pumping-Engine, 1880.]\r\n\r\nIn the figure, _A_ is the cylinder, taking steam from the boiler\r\nthrough the steam-passage, _M_. The steam is first admitted above the\r\npiston, _B_, driving it rapidly downward and raising the pump-rod,\r\n_E_. At an early period in the stroke the admission of steam is\r\nchecked by the sudden closing of the induction-valve at _M_, and the\r\nstroke is completed under the action of expanding steam assisted by\r\nthe inertia of the heavy parts already in motion. The necessary weight\r\nand inertia is afforded, in many cases, where the engine is applied to\r\nthe pumping of deep mines, by the immensely long and heavy pump-rods.\r\nWhere this weight is too great, it is counterbalanced, and where too\r\nsmall, weights are added. When the stroke is completed, the\r\n\"equilibrium valve\" is opened, and the steam passes from above to the\r\nspace below the piston, and an equilibrium of pressure being thus\r\nproduced, the pump-rods descend, forcing the water from the pumps and\r\nraising the steam-piston. The absence of the crank, or other device\r\nwhich might determine absolutely the length of stroke, compels a very\r\ncareful adjustment of steam-admission to the amount of load. Should\r\nthe stroke be allowed to exceed the proper length, and should danger\r\nthus arise of the piston striking the cylinder-head, _N_, the movement\r\nis checked by buffer-beams. The valve-motion is actuated by a\r\nplug-rod, _J K_, as in Watt's engine. The regulation is effected by a\r\n\"cataract,\" a kind of hydraulic governor, consisting of a\r\nplunger-pump, with a reservoir attached. The plunger is raised by the\r\nengine, and then automatically detached. It falls with greater or less\r\nrapidity, its velocity being determined by the size of the\r\neduction-orifice, which is adjustable by hand. When the plunger\r\nreaches the bottom of the pump-barrel, it disengages a catch, a weight\r\nis allowed to act upon the steam-valve, opening it, and the engine is\r\ncaused to make a stroke. When the outlet of the cataract is nearly\r\nclosed, the engine stands still a considerable time while the plunger\r\nis descending, and the strokes succeed each other at long intervals.\r\nWhen the opening is greater, the cataract acts more rapidly, and the\r\nengine works faster. This has been regarded until recently as the most\r\neconomical of pumping-engines, and it is still generally used in\r\nfreeing mines of water, and in situations where existing heavy\r\npump-rods may be utilized in counterbalancing the steam-pressure, and,\r\nby their inertia, in continuing the motion after the steam, by its\r\nexpansion, has become greatly reduced in pressure.\r\n\r\nIn this engine a gracefully-shaped and strong beam, _D_, has taken\r\nthe place of the ruder beam of the earlier period, and is carried on a\r\nwell-built wall of masonry, _R_. _F_ is the exhaust-valve, by which\r\nthe steam passes to the condenser, _G_, beside which is the air-pump,\r\n_H_, and the hot-well, _I_. The cylinder is steam-jacketed, _P_, and\r\nprotected against losses of heat by radiation by a brick wall, _O_,\r\nthe whole resting on a heavy foundation, _Q_.\r\n\r\nThe Bull Cornish engine is also still not infrequently seen in use.\r\nThe Cornish engine of Great Britain averages a duty of about\r\n45,000,000 pounds raised one foot high per 100 pounds of coal. More\r\nthan double this economy has sometimes been attained.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 102.--Steam-Pump.]\r\n\r\nA vastly simpler form of pumping-engine without fly-wheel is the now\r\ncommon \"direct-acting steam-pump.\" This engine is generally made use\r\nof in feeding steam-boilers, as a forcing and fire pump, and wherever\r\nthe amount of water to be moved is not large, and where the pressure\r\nis comparatively great. The steam-cylinder, _A R_, and feed-pump, _B\r\nQ_ (Fig. 102), are in line, and the two pistons have usually one rod,\r\n_D_, in common. The two cylinders are connected by a strong frame,\r\n_N_, and two standards fitted with lugs carry the whole, and serve as\r\na means of bolting the pump to the floor or to its foundation.\r\n\r\nThe method of working the steam-valve of the modern steam-pump is\r\ningenious and peculiar. As shown, the pistons are moving toward the\r\nleft; when they reach the end of their stroke, the face of the piston\r\nstrikes a pin or other contrivance, and thus moves a small auxiliary\r\nvalve, _I_, which opens a port, _E_, and causes steam to be admitted\r\nbehind a piston, or permits steam to be exhausted, as in the figure,\r\nfrom before the auxiliary piston, _F_, and the pressure within the\r\nmain steam-chest then forces that piston over, moving the main\r\nsteam-valve, _G_, to which it is attached, admitting steam to the\r\nleft-hand side of the main piston, and exhausting on the right-hand\r\nside, _A_. Thus the motion of the engine operates its own valves in\r\nsuch a manner that it is never liable to stop working at the end of\r\nthe stroke, notwithstanding the absence of the crank and fly-wheel, or\r\nof independent mechanism, like the cataract of the Cornish engine.\r\nThere is a very considerable variety of pumps of this class, all\r\ndiffering in detail, but all presenting the distinguishing feature of\r\nauxiliary valve and piston, and a connection by which it and the main\r\nengine each works the valve of the other combination.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 103.--The Worthington Pumping-Engine, 1876.\r\nSection.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 104.--The Worthington Pumping-Engine.]\r\n\r\nIn some cases these pumps are made of considerable size, and are\r\napplied to the elevation of water in situations to which the Cornish\r\nengine was formerly considered exclusively applicable. The\r\naccompanying figure illustrates such a pumping-engine, as built for\r\nsupplying cities with water. This is a \"compound\" direct-acting\r\npumping-engine. The cylinders, _A B_, are placed in line, working one\r\npump, _F_, and operating their own air-pumps, _D D_, by a bell-crank\r\nlever, _L H_, connected to the pump-buckets by links, _I K_. Steam\r\nexhausted from the small cylinder, _A_, is further expanded in the\r\nlarge cylinder, _B_, and thence goes to the condenser, _C_. The\r\nvalves, _N M_, are moved by the valve-gear, _L_, which is actuated by\r\nthe piston-rod of a similar pair of cylinders placed by the side of\r\nthe first. These valves are balanced, and the balance-plates, _R Q_,\r\nare suspended from the rods, _O P_, which allow them to move with the\r\nvalves. By connecting the valves of each engine with the piston-rod\r\nof the other, it is seen that the two engines must work alternately,\r\nthe one making a stroke while the other is still, and then itself\r\nstopping a moment while the latter makes its stroke.\r\n\r\nWater enters the pump through the induction-pipe, _E_, passes into the\r\npump-barrel through the valves, _V V_, and issues through the\r\neduction-valves, _T T_, and goes on to the \"mains\" by the pipe, _G_,\r\nabove which is seen an air-chamber, which assists to preserve a\r\nuniform pressure on that side the pump. This engine works very\r\nsmoothly and quietly, is cheap and durable, and has done excellent\r\nduty.\r\n\r\nBeam pumping-engines are now almost invariably built with crank and\r\nfly-wheel, and very frequently are compound engines. The accompanying\r\nillustration represents an engine of the latter form.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 105.--Double-Cylinder Pumping-Engine, 1878.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 106.--The Lawrence Water-Works Engine.]\r\n\r\n_A_ and _B_ are the two steam-cylinders, connected by links and\r\nparallel motion, _C D_, to the great cast-iron beam, _E F_. At the\r\nopposite end of the beam, the connecting-rod, _G_, turns a crank,\r\n_H_, and fly-wheel, _L M_, which regulates the motion of the engine\r\nand controls the length of stroke, averting all danger of accident\r\noccurring in consequence of the piston striking either cylinder-head.\r\nThe beam is carried on handsomely-shaped iron columns, which, with\r\ncylinders, pump, and fly-wheel, are supported by a substantial stone\r\nfoundation. The pump-rod, _I_, works a double-acting pump, _J_, and\r\nthe resistance to the issuing water is rendered uniform by an\r\nair-chamber, _K_, within which the water rises and falls when\r\npressures tend to vary greatly. A revolving shaft, _N_, driven from\r\nthe fly-wheel shaft, carries cams, _O P_, which move the lifting-rods\r\nseen directly over them and the valves which they actuate. Between the\r\nsteam-cylinders and the columns which carry the beams is a well, in\r\nwhich are placed the condenser and air-pump. Steam is carried at 60 or\r\n80 pounds pressure, and expanded from 6 to 10 times.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 107.--The Leavitt Pumping-Engine.]\r\n\r\nA later form of double-cylinder beam pumping-engine is that invented\r\nand designed by E. D. Leavitt, Jr., for the Lawrence Water-Works, and\r\nshown in Figs. 106 and 107. The two cylinders are placed one on each\r\nside the centre of the beam, and are so inclined that they may be\r\ncoupled to opposite ends of it, while their lower ends are placed\r\nclose together. At their upper ends a valve is placed at each end of\r\nthe connecting steam-pipe. At their lower ends a single valve serves\r\nas exhaust-valve to the high-pressure and as steam-valve to the\r\nlow-pressure cylinder. The pistons move in opposite directions, and\r\nsteam is exhausted from the high-pressure cylinder directly into the\r\nnearer end of the low-pressure cylinder. The pump, of the\r\n\"Thames-Ditton\" or \"bucket-and-plunger\" variety, takes a full supply\r\nof water on the down-stroke, and discharges half when rising and half\r\nwhen descending again. The duty of this engine is reported by a board\r\nof engineers as 103,923,215 foot-pounds for every 100 pounds of coal\r\nburned. The duty of a moderately good engine is usually considered to\r\nbe from 60 to 70 millions. This engine has steam-cylinders of 17-1/2\r\nand 36 inches diameter respectively, with a stroke of 7 feet. The pump\r\nhad a capacity of about 195 gallons, and delivered 96 per cent. Steam\r\nwas carried at a pressure of 75 pounds above the atmosphere, and was\r\nexpanded about 10 times. Plain horizontal tubular boilers were used,\r\nevaporating 8.58 pounds of water from 98 deg. Fahr. per pound of coal.\r\n\r\nSTEAM-BOILERS.--The steam supplied to the forms of stationary engine\r\nwhich have been described is generated in steam-boilers of exceedingly\r\nvaried forms. The type used is determined by the extent to which their\r\ncost is increased in the endeavor to economize fuel by the pressure of\r\nsteam carried, by the greater or less necessity of providing against\r\nrisk of explosion, by the character of the feed-water to be used, by\r\nthe facilities which may exist for keeping in good repair, and even by\r\nthe character of the men in whose hands the apparatus is likely to be\r\nplaced.\r\n\r\nAs has been seen, the changes which have marked the growth and\r\ndevelopment of the steam-engine have been accompanied by equally\r\nmarked changes in the forms of the steam-boiler. At first, the same\r\nvessel served the distinct purposes of steam-generator and\r\nsteam-engine. Later, it became separated from the engine, and was then\r\nspecially fitted to perform its own peculiar functions; and its form\r\nwent through a series of modifications under the action of the causes\r\nalready stated.\r\n\r\nWhen steam began to be usefully applied, and considerable pressures\r\nbecame necessary, the forms given to boilers were approximately\r\nspherical, ellipsoidal, or cylindrical. Thus the boilers of De Caus\r\n(1615) and of the Marquis of Worcester (1663) were spherical and\r\ncylindrical; those of Savery (1698) were ellipsoidal and cylindrical.\r\nAfter the invention of the steam-engine of Newcomen, the pressures\r\nadopted were again very low, and steam-boilers were given irregular\r\nforms until, at the beginning of the present century, they were again\r\nof necessity given stronger shapes. The material was at first\r\nfrequently copper; it is now usually wrought-iron, and sometimes\r\nsteel.\r\n\r\nThe present forms of steam-boilers may be classified as plain, flue,\r\nand tubular boilers. The plain cylindrical or common cylinder boiler\r\nis the only representative of the first class in common use. It is\r\nperfectly cylindrical, with heads either flat or hemispherical. There\r\nis usually attached to the boiler a \"steam-drum\" (a small cylindrical\r\nvessel), from which the steam is taken by the steam-pipe. This\r\nenlargement of the steam-space permits the mist, held in suspension by\r\nthe steam when it first rises from the surface of the water, to\r\nseparate more or less completely before the steam is taken from the\r\nboiler.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 108.--Babcock & Wilcox's Vertical Boiler.]\r\n\r\nFlue-boilers are frequently cylindrical, and contain one or more\r\ncylindrical flues, which pass through from end to end, beneath the\r\nwater-line, conducting the furnace-gases, and affording a greater area\r\nof heating-surface than can be obtained in the plain boiler. They are\r\nusually from 30 to 48 inches in diameter, and one foot or less in\r\nlength for each inch of diameter. Some are, however, made 100 feet and\r\nmore in length. The boiler is made of iron 1/4 to 3/8 of an inch in\r\nthickness, with hemispherical or carefully stayed flat heads, and\r\nwithout flues. The whole is placed in a brickwork setting. These\r\nboilers are used where fuel is inexpensive, where the cost of\r\nrepairing would be great, or where the feed-water is impure. A\r\ncylindrical boiler, having one flue traversing it longitudinally, is\r\ncalled a Cornish boiler, as it is generally supposed to have been\r\nfirst used in Cornwall. It was probably first invented by Oliver Evans\r\nin the United States, previous to 1786, at which time he had it in\r\nuse. The flue has usually a diameter 0.5 or 0.6 the diameter of the\r\nboiler. A boiler containing two longitudinal flues is called the\r\nLancashire boiler. This form was also introduced by Oliver Evans. The\r\nflues have one-third the diameter of the boiler. Several flues of\r\nsmaller diameter are often used, and when a still greater proportional\r\narea of heating-surface is required, tubes of from 1-1/4 inch to 4 or\r\n5 inches in diameter are substituted for flues. The flues are usually\r\nconstructed by riveting sheets together, as in making the shell or\r\nouter portion. They are sometimes welded by British manufacturers, but\r\nrarely if ever in the United States. Tubes are always \"lap-welded\" in\r\nthe process of rolling them. Small tubes were first used in the United\r\nStates, about 1785. In portable, locomotive, and marine steam-boilers,\r\nthe fire must be built within the boiler itself, instead of (as in the\r\nabove described stationary boilers) in a furnace of brickwork exterior\r\nto the boiler. The flame and gases from the furnace or fire-box in\r\nthese kinds of boiler are never led through brick passages en route to\r\nthe chimney, as often in the preceding case, but are invariably\r\nconducted through flues or tubes, or both, to the smoke-stack. These\r\nboilers are also sometimes used as stationary boilers. Fig. 108\r\nrepresents such a steam-boiler in section, as it is usually exhibited\r\nin working drawings. Provision is made to secure a good circulation of\r\nwater in these boilers by means of the \"baffle-plates,\" seen in the\r\nsketch, which compel the water to flow as indicated by the arrows.\r\nThe tubes are frequently made of brass or of copper, to secure rapid\r\ntransmission of heat to the water, and thus to permit the use of a\r\nsmaller area of heating-surface and a smaller boiler. The steam-space\r\nis made as large as possible, to secure immunity from \"priming\" or the\r\n\"entrainment\" of water with the steam. This type of steam-boiler,\r\ninvented by Nathan Read, of Salem, Mass., in 1791, and patented in\r\nApril of that year, was the earliest of the tubular boilers. In the\r\nlocomotive boiler (Fig. 109), as in the preceding, the characteristics\r\nare a fire-box at one end of the shell and a set of tubes through\r\nwhich the gases pass directly to the smoke-stack. Strength,\r\ncompactness, great steaming capacity, fair economy, moderate cost, and\r\nconvenience of combination with the running parts, are secured by the\r\nadoption of this form. It is frequently used also for portable and\r\nstationary engines. It was invented in France by M. Seguin, and in\r\nEngland by Booth, and used by George Stephenson at about the same\r\ntime--1828 or 1829.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 109.--Stationary \"Locomotive\" Boiler.]\r\n\r\nSince the efficiency of a steam-boiler depends upon the extent of\r\neffective heating-surface per unit of weight of fuel burned in any\r\ngiven time--or, ordinarily, upon the ratio of the areas of heating and\r\ngrate surface--peculiar expedients are sometimes adopted, having for\r\ntheir object the increase of heating-surface, without change of form\r\nof boiler and without proportionate increase of cost.\r\n\r\nOne of these methods is that of the use of Galloway conical tubes\r\n(Fig. 110). These are very largely used in Great Britain, but are\r\nseldom if ever seen in the United States. The Cornish boiler, to which\r\nthey are usually applied, consists of a large cylindrical shell, 6\r\nfeet or more in diameter, containing one tube of about one-half as\r\ngreat dimensions, or sometimes two of one-third the diameter of the\r\nshell each. Such boilers have a very small ratio of heating to grate\r\nsurface, and their large tubes are peculiarly liable to collapse. To\r\nremove these objections, the Messrs. Galloway introduced stay-tubes\r\ninto the flues, which tubes are conical in form, and are set in either\r\na vertical or an inclined position, the larger end uppermost. The area\r\nof heating-surface is thus greatly increased, and, at the same time,\r\nthe liability to collapse is reduced. The same results are obtained by\r\nanother device of Galloway, which is sometimes combined with that just\r\ndescribed in the same boiler. Several sheets in the flue have\r\n\"pockets\" worked into them, which pockets project into the\r\nflue-passage.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 110.]\r\n\r\nAnother device is that of an American engineer, Miller, who surrounds\r\nthe furnace of cylindrical and other boilers with water-tubes. The\r\n\"fuel-economizers\" of Greene and others consist of similar collections\r\nof tubes set in the flues, between the boiler and the chimney.\r\n\r\n\"_Sectional_\" boilers are gradually coming into use with high\r\npressures, on account of their greater safety against disastrous\r\nexplosions. The earliest practicable example of a boiler of this class\r\nwas probably that of Colonel John Stevens, of Hoboken, N. J. Dr.\r\nAlban, who, forty years later, attempted to bring this type into\r\ngeneral use, and constructed a number of such boilers, did not\r\nsucceed. Their introduction, like that of all radical changes in\r\nengineering, has been but slow, and it has been only recently that\r\ntheir manufacture has become an important branch of industry.\r\n\r\nA committee of the American Institute, of which the author was\r\nchairman, in 1871, examined several boilers of this and the ordinary\r\ntype, and tested them very carefully. They reported that they felt\r\n\"confident that the introduction of this class of steam-boilers will\r\ndo much toward the removal of the cause of that universal feeling of\r\ndistrust which renders the presence of a steam-boiler so objectionable\r\nin every locality. The difficulties in thoroughly inspecting these\r\nboilers, in regulating their action, and other faults of the class,\r\nare gradually being overcome, and the committee look forward with\r\nconfidence to the time when their use will become general, to the\r\nexclusion of older and more dangerous forms of steam-boilers.\"\r\n\r\nThe economical performance of these boilers with a similar ratio of\r\nheating to grate surface is equal to that of other kinds. In fact,\r\nthey are usually given a somewhat higher ratio, and their economy of\r\nfuel frequently exceeds that of the other types. Their principal\r\ndefect is their small capacity for steam and water, which makes it\r\nextremely difficult to obtain steady steam-pressure. Where they are\r\nemployed, the feed and draught should be, if possible, controlled by\r\nautomatic attachments, and the feed-water heated to the highest\r\nattainable temperature. Their satisfactory working depends, more than\r\nin other cases, on the ability of the fireman, and can only be secured\r\nby the exercise of both care and skill.\r\n\r\nMany forms of these boilers have been devised. Walter Hancock\r\nconstructed boilers for his steam-carriage of flat plates connected by\r\nstay-bolts, several such sections composing the boiler; and about the\r\nsame time (1828) Sir Goldsworthy Gurney constructed for a similar\r\npurpose boilers consisting of a steam and a water reservoir, placed\r\none above the other, and connected by triangularly-bent water-tubes\r\nexposed to the heat of the furnace-gases. Jacob Perkins made many\r\nexperiments looking to the employment of very high steam-pressures,\r\nand in 1831 patented a boiler of this class, in which the\r\nheating-surfaces nearest the fire were composed of iron tubes, which\r\ntubes also served as grate-bars. The steam and water space was\r\nprincipally comprised within a comparatively large chamber, of which\r\nthe walls were secured by closely distributed stay-bolts. For\r\nextremely high pressures, boilers composed only of tubes were used.\r\nDr. Ernst Alban described the boiler already referred to, and its\r\nconstruction and operation, and stated that he had experimented with\r\npressures as high as 1,000 pounds to the square inch.\r\n\r\nThe Harrison steam-boiler, which has been many years in use in the\r\nUnited States, consists of several sections, each of which is made up\r\nof hollow globes of cast-iron, communicating with each other by necks\r\ncast upon the spheres, and fitted together with faced joints. Long\r\nbolts, extending from end to end of each row, bind the spheres\r\ntogether. (_See_ Fig. 111.)\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 111.--Harrison's Sectional Boiler.]\r\n\r\nAn example of another modern type in extensive use is given in Fig.\r\n112, a semi-sectional boiler, which consists of a series of inclined\r\nwrought-iron tubes, connected by T-heads, which form the vertical\r\nwater-channels, at each end. The joints are faced by milling them, and\r\nthen ground so perfectly tight that a pressure of 500 pounds to the\r\nsquare inch is insufficient to produce leakage. No packing is used.\r\nThe fire is made under the front and higher end of the tubes, and the\r\nproducts of combustion pass up between the tubes into a\r\ncombustion-chamber under the steam and water drum; hence they pass\r\ndown between the tubes, then once more up through the space between\r\nthe tubes, and off to the chimney. The steam is taken out at the top\r\nof the steam-drum near the back end of the boiler. The rapid\r\ncirculation prevents to some extent the formation of deposits or\r\nincrustations upon the heating-surfaces, sweeping them away and\r\ndepositing them in the mud-drum, whence they are blown out. Rapid\r\ncirculation of water, as has been shown by Prof. Trowbridge, also\r\nassists in the extraction of the heat from the gases, by the\r\npresentation of fresh water continually, as well as by the prevention\r\nof incrustation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 112.--Babcock and Wilcox's Sectional Boiler.]\r\n\r\nAttempts have been made to adapt sectional boilers to marine engines;\r\nbut very little progress has yet been made in their introduction. The\r\nRoot sectional boiler (Fig. 113), an American design, which is in\r\nextensive use in the United States and Europe, has also been\r\nexperimentally placed in service on shipboard. Its heating-surface\r\nconsists wholly of tubes, which are connected by a peculiarly formed\r\nseries of caps; the joints are made tight with rubber \"grummets.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 113.--Root Sectional Boiler.]\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION II.--PORTABLE AND LOCOMOTIVE ENGINES.\r\n\r\nEngines and boilers, when of small size, are now often combined in one\r\nstructure which may be readily transported. Where they have a common\r\nbase-plate simply, as in Fig. 114, they are called, usually,\r\n\"semi-portable engines.\" These little engines have some decided\r\nadvantages. Being attached to one base, the combined engine and boiler\r\nis easily transported, occupies little space, and may very readily be\r\nmounted upon wheels, rendering it peculiarly well adapted for\r\nagricultural purposes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 114.--Semi-Portable Engine, 1878.]\r\n\r\nThe example here shown differs in its design from those usually seen\r\nin the market. The engine is not fastened to or upon the boiler, and\r\nis therefore not affected by expansion, nor are the bearings\r\noverheated by conduction or by ascending heat from the boiler. The\r\nfly-wheel is at the base, which arrangement secures steadiness at the\r\nhigh speed which is a requisite for economy of fuel. The boilers are\r\nof the upright tubular style, with internal fire-box, and are\r\nintended to be worked at 150 pounds pressure per inch. They are fitted\r\nwith a baffle-plate and circulating-pipe, to prevent priming, and also\r\nwith a fusible plug, which will melt and prevent the crown-sheet of\r\nthe boiler burning, if the water gets low.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 115.--Semi-Portable Engine, 1878.]\r\n\r\nAnother illustration of this form of engine, as built in small sizes,\r\nis seen below. The peculiarity of this engine is, that the cylinder is\r\nplaced in the top of the boiler, which is upright. By this arrangement\r\nthe engine is constantly drawing from the boiler the hottest and\r\ndriest steam, and there is thus no liability of serious loss by\r\ncondensation, which is rapid, even in a short pipe, when the engine is\r\nseparate from the boiler.\r\n\r\nThe engine illustrated is rated at 10 horse-power, and makers are\r\nalways expected to guarantee their machines to work up to the rated\r\npower. The cylinder is 7 by 7 inches, and the main shaft is directly\r\nover it. On this shaft are three eccentrics, one working the pump, one\r\nmoving the valves, and the third one operating the cut-off. The\r\ndriving-pulley is 20 inches in diameter, and the balance-wheel 30\r\ninches. The boiler has 15 1-1/4-inch flues. It is furnished with a\r\nheater in its lower portion. The boiler of this engine is tested up to\r\n200 pounds, and is calculated to carry 100 pounds working pressure,\r\nthough that is not necessary to develop the full power of the engine.\r\nThe compactness of the whole machine is exceptional. It can be set up\r\nin a space 5 feet square and 8 feet high. The weight of the 10\r\nhorse-power engine is 1,540 pounds, and of the whole machine 4,890\r\npounds, boxed for shipment. Every part of the mechanism usually fits\r\nand works with the exactness of a gun-lock, as each piece is carefully\r\nmade to gauge.\r\n\r\nPortable engines are those which are especially intended to be moved\r\nconveniently from place to place. The engine is usually attached to\r\nthe boiler, and the feed-pump is generally attached to the engine. The\r\nwhole machine is carried on wheels, and is moved from one place to\r\nanother, usually by horses, but sometimes by its own engine, which is\r\ncoupled by an engaging and disengaging apparatus to the rear-wheels.\r\nEnglish builders have usually excelled in the construction of this\r\nclass of steam-engine, although it is probable that the best American\r\nengines are fully equal to them in design, material, and construction.\r\n\r\nThe later work of the best-known English builders has given economical\r\nresults that have surprised engineers. The annual \"shows\" of the Royal\r\nAgricultural Society have elicited good evidence of skill in\r\nmanagement as well as of excellence of design and construction. Some\r\nlittle portable engines have exhibited an economical efficiency\r\nsuperior to that of the largest marine engines of any but the compound\r\ntype, and even closely competing with that form. The causes of this\r\nremarkable economy are readily learned by an inspection of these\r\nengines, and by observation of the method of managing them at the\r\ntest-trial. The engines are usually very carefully designed. The\r\ncylinders are nicely proportioned to their work, and their pistons\r\ntravel at high speed. Their valve-gear consists usually of a plain\r\nslide-valve, supplemented by a separate expansion-slide, driven by an\r\nindependent eccentric, and capable of considerable variation\r\nin the point of cut-off. This form of expansion-gear is very\r\neffective--almost as much so as a drop cut-off--at the usual grade of\r\nexpansion, which is not far from four times. The governor is usually\r\nattached to a throttle-valve in the steam-pipe, an arrangement which\r\nis not the best possible under variable loads, but which produces no\r\nserious loss of efficiency when the engine is driven, as at\r\ncompetitive trials, under the very uniform load of a Prony strap-brake\r\nand at very nearly the maximum capacity of the machine. The most\r\nsuccessful engines have had steam-jacketed cylinders--always an\r\nessential to maximum economy--with high steam and a considerable\r\nexpansion. The boilers are strongly made, and are, as are also all\r\nother heated surfaces, carefully clothed with non-conducting material,\r\nand well lagged over all. The details are carefully proportioned, the\r\nrods and frames are strong and well secured together, and the bearings\r\nhave large rubbing-surfaces. The connecting-rods are long and\r\neasy-working, and every part is capable of doing its work without\r\nstraining and with the least friction.\r\n\r\nIn handling the engines at the competitive trial, most experienced and\r\nskillful drivers are selected. The difference between the performances\r\nof the same engine in different hands has been found to amount to from\r\n10 to 15 per cent., even where the competitors were both considered\r\nexceptionally skillful men. In manipulating the engine, the fires are\r\nattended to with the utmost care; coal is thrown upon them at regular\r\nand frequent intervals, and a uniform depth of fuel and a perfectly\r\nclean fire are secured. The sides and corners of the fire are looked\r\nafter with especial care. The fire-doors are kept open the least\r\npossible time; not a square inch of grate-surface is left unutilized,\r\nand every pound of coal gives out its maximum of calorific power, and\r\nin precisely the place where it is needed. Feed-water is supplied as\r\nnearly as possible continuously, and with the utmost regularity. In\r\nsome cases the engine-driver stands by his engine constantly, feeding\r\nthe fire with coal in handfuls, and supplying the water to the heater\r\nby hand by means of a cup. Heaters are invariably used in such cases.\r\nThe exhaust is contracted no more than is absolutely necessary for\r\ndraught. The brake is watched carefully, lest irregularity of\r\nlubrication should cause oscillation of speed with the changing\r\nresistance. The load is made the maximum which the engine is designed\r\nto drive with economy. Thus all conditions are made as favorable as\r\npossible to economy, and they are preserved as invariable as the\r\nutmost care on the part of the attendant can make them.\r\n\r\nThese trials are usually of only three or five hours' duration, and\r\nthus terminate before it becomes necessary to clean fires. The\r\nfollowing are results obtained at the trial of engines which took\r\nplace in July, 1870, at the Oxford Agricultural Fair:\r\n\r\n  KEY:\r\n  A: Number.\r\n  B: Diameter.\r\n  C: Stroke.\r\n  D: Nominal.\r\n  E: Dynamometric.\r\n  F: Point of cut off.\r\n  G: Revolutions per minute.\r\n  H: Pounds coal per horse-power per hour.\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-------------+-----+--------------+------+------+----\r\n  MAKERS' NAME   | CYLINDERS.  |     | HORSE-POWER. |      |      |\r\n      AND        +-----+-------+     +-------+------+      |      |\r\n   RESIDENCE.    |  A  |   B   |  C  |   D   |  E   |  F   |  G   |  H\r\n  ---------------+-----+-------+-----+-------+------+------+------+----\r\n                 |     |Inches.| In. |       |      |      |      |\r\n  Clayton,       |     |       |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n  Shuttleworth   |  1  | 7     |  12 |   4   | 4.42 |  ... |121.65|3.73\r\n  & Co., Lincoln |     |       |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n                 |     |       |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n  Brown & May,   |     |       |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n  Devizes        |  1  | 7-3/16|  12 |   4   | 4.19 | 11.48|125.65|4.44\r\n                 |     |       |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n  Reading Iron-  |     |       |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n  Works Company, |  1  | 5-3/4 |  14 |   4   | 4.16 |  ... |145.7 |4.65\r\n  Reading        |     |       |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n  ---------------+-----+-------+-----+-------+------+------+------+----\r\n\r\nThese were horizontal engines, attached to locomotive boilers.\r\n\r\nAt a similar exhibition held at Bury, in 1867, considerably better\r\nresults even than these were reported, as below, from engines of\r\nsimilar size and styles:\r\n\r\n  KEY:\r\n  A: Number.\r\n  B: Diameter.\r\n  C: Stroke.\r\n  D: Nominal.\r\n  E: Dynamometric.\r\n  F: Point of cut off.\r\n  G: Revolutions per minute.\r\n  H: Pounds coal per horse-power per hour.\r\n\r\n  ---------------+-------------+-----+--------------+------+------+----\r\n  MAKERS' NAME   | CYLINDERS.  |     | HORSE-POWER. |      |      |\r\n      AND        +-----+-------+     +-------+------+      |      |\r\n   RESIDENCE.    |  A  |   B   |  C  |   D   |  E   |  F   |  G   |  H\r\n  ---------------+-----+-------+-----+-------+------+------+------+----\r\n                 |     |Inches.| In. |       |      |      |      |\r\n  Clayton,       |     |       |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n  Shuttleworth   |  1  |10     | 20  |   10  | 11.00| 3.10 | 71.5 | 4.13\r\n  & Co., Lincoln |     |       |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n                 |     |       |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n  Reading Iron-  |     |       |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n  Works Company, |  1  | 8-5/8 | 20  |   10  | 10.43| 1.4  |109.4 | 4.22\r\n  Reading        |     |       |     |       |      |      |      |\r\n  ---------------+-----+-------+-----+-------+------+------+------+----\r\n\r\nWith all these engines steam-jackets were used; the feed-water was\r\nhighly and uniformly heated by exhaust-steam; the coal was selected,\r\nfinely broken, and thrown on the fire with the greatest care; the\r\nvelocity of the engines, the steam-pressure, and the amount of\r\nfeed-water, were very carefully regulated, and all bearings were run\r\nquite loose; the engine-drivers were usually expert \"jockeys.\"\r\n\r\nThe next illustration represents the portable steam-engine as built by\r\none of the oldest and most experienced manufacturers of such engines\r\nin the United States.\r\n\r\nIn the boilers of these engines the heating-surface is given less\r\nextent than in the stationary engine-boiler, but much greater than in\r\nthe locomotive, and varies from 10 to 20 square feet per horse-power.\r\nThe boilers are made very strong, to enable them to withstand the\r\nstrains due to the attached engine, which are estimated as equivalent\r\nto from one-tenth to one-fifth that due to the steam-pressure. The\r\nboiler is sometimes given even double the strength usual with\r\nstationary boilers of similar capacity. The engine is mounted, in this\r\nexample, directly over the boiler, and all parts are in sight and\r\nreadily accessible to the engineer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 116.--The Portable Steam-Engine, 1878.]\r\n\r\nOne of these engines, of 20 horse-power, has a steam-cylinder 10\r\ninches in diameter and 18 inches stroke of piston, making 125\r\nrevolutions per minute, and has 9 square feet of grate-surface and 288\r\nfeet of heating-surface. It weighs about 4-1/2 tons. Steam is carried\r\nat 125 pounds.\r\n\r\nIn the class of engines just described, the draught is obtained by the\r\nblast of the exhaust-steam which is led into the chimney. Such engines\r\nare now sold at from $120 to $150 per horse-power, according to size\r\nand quality, the smaller engines costing most. The usual consumption\r\nof fuel is from 4 to 6 pounds per hour and per horse-power, burning\r\nfrom 15 to 20 pounds on each square foot of grate, and each pound\r\nevaporating about 8 pounds of water. A usual weight is, for the larger\r\nsizes, 500 pounds per horse-power.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 117.--The Thrashers' Road-Engine, 1878.]\r\n\r\nThese engines are sometimes arranged to propel themselves, as in the\r\nMills \"Thrashers'\" road-engine or locomotive, of which the\r\naccompanying engraving is a good representation. This engine is\r\nproportioned for hauling a tank containing 10 barrels, or more, of\r\nwater and a grain-separator over all ordinary roads, and to drive a\r\nthrashing-machine or saw-mill, developing 20 or 25 horse-power. This\r\nexample of the road-engine has a boiler built to work at 250 pounds of\r\nsteam; the engine is designed for a maximum power of 30 horses.\r\n\r\nThis engine has a balanced valve and automatic cut-off, and is fitted\r\nwith a reversing-gear for use on the road. The driving-wheels are of\r\nwrought-iron, 56 inches diameter and 8 inches wide, with cast-iron\r\ndriving-arms. Both wheels are drivers on curves as well as on straight\r\nlines. The engine is guided and fired by one man, and the total weight\r\nis so small that it will pass safely over any good country bridge. A\r\nbrake is attached, to insure safety when going down-hill. Although\r\ndesigned to move at a speed of about three miles per hour, the\r\nvelocity of the piston may be increased so that four miles per hour\r\nmay be accomplished when necessary.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 118.--Fisher's Steam-Carriage.]\r\n\r\nThis is an excellent example of this kind of engine as constructed at\r\nthe present time. The strongly-built boiler, with its heater, the\r\njacketed cylinder, and light, strong frame of the engine, the steel\r\nrunning-gear, the carefully-covered surfaces of cylinder and boiler,\r\nand excellent proportions of details, are illustrations of good modern\r\nengineering, and are in curious contrast with the first of the class,\r\nbuilt a century earlier by Smeaton.\r\n\r\nSteam-carriages for passengers are now rarely built. Fig. 118\r\nrepresents that designed by Fisher about 1870 or earlier. It was only\r\nworked experimentally.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 119.--Road and Farm Locomotive.]\r\n\r\nThe above is an engraving of a road and farm locomotive as built by\r\none of the most successful among several British firms engaged in this\r\nwork.\r\n\r\nThe capacity of these engines has been determined by experiment by the\r\nauthor in the United States, and abroad by several distinguished\r\nengineers.\r\n\r\nThe author made a trial of one of these engines at South Orange, N.\r\nJ., to determine its power, speed, and convenience of working and\r\nman[oe]uvring. The following were the principal dimensions:\r\n\r\n  Weight of engine, complete, 5 tons 4 cwt.          11,648 pounds.\r\n  Steam-cylinder--diameter                                7-3/4 inches.\r\n  Stroke of piston                                       10 inches.\r\n  Revolution of crank to one of driving-wheels           17\r\n  Driving-wheels--diameter                               60 inches.\r\n      \"           breadth of tire                        10 inches.\r\n      \"           weight, each                          450 pounds.\r\n  Boiler--length over all                                 8 feet.\r\n    \"     diameter of shell                              30 feet.\r\n    \"     thickness of shell                           7/16 inch.\r\n    \"     fire-box sheets, outside, thickness           1/2 inch.\r\n  Load on driving-wheels, 4 tons 10 cwt.             10,080 pounds.\r\n\r\nThe boiler was of the ordinary locomotive type, and the engine was\r\nmounted upon it, as is usual with portable engines.\r\n\r\nThe steam-cylinder was steam-jacketed, in accordance with the most\r\nadvanced practice here and abroad. The crank-shaft and other\r\nwrought-iron parts subjected to heavy strains were strong and plainly\r\nfinished. The gearing was of malleableized cast-iron, and all\r\nbearings, from crank-shaft to driving-wheel, on each side, were\r\ncarried by a single sheet of half-inch plate, which also formed the\r\nsides of the fire-box exterior.\r\n\r\nThe following is a summary of the conclusions deduced by the author\r\nfrom the trial, and published in the _Journal of the Franklin\r\nInstitute_: A traction-engine may be so constructed as to be easily\r\nand rapidly man[oe]uvred on the common road; and an engine weighing\r\nover 5 tons may be turned continuously without difficulty on a circle\r\nof 18 feet radius, or even on a road but little wider than the length\r\nof the engine. A locomotive of 5 tons 4 hundredweight has been\r\nconstructed, capable of drawing on a good road 23,000 pounds up a\r\ngrade of 533 feet to the mile, at the rate of four miles an hour; and\r\none might be constructed to draw more than 63,000 pounds up a grade of\r\n225 feet to the mile, at the rate of two miles an hour.\r\n\r\nIt was further shown that the coefficient of traction with\r\nheavily-laden wagons on a good macadamized road is not far from .04;\r\nthe traction-power of this engine is equal to that of 20 horses; the\r\nweight, exclusive of the weight of the engine, that could be drawn on\r\na level road, was 163,452 pounds; and the amount of fuel required is\r\nestimated at 500 pounds a day. The advantages claimed for the\r\ntraction-engine over horse-power are: no necessity for a limitation of\r\nworking-hours; a difference in first cost in favor of steam; and in\r\nheavy work on a common road the expense by steam is less than 25 per\r\ncent. of the average cost of horse-power, a traction-engine capable of\r\ndoing the work of 25 horses being worked at as little expense as 6 or\r\n8 horses. The cost of hauling heavy loads has been estimated at 7\r\ncents per ton per mile.\r\n\r\nSuch engines are gradually becoming useful in steam-ploughing. Two\r\nsystems are adopted. In the one the engine is stationary, and hauls a\r\n\"gang\" of ploughs by means of a windlass and wire rope; in the other\r\nthe engine traverses a field, drawing behind it a plough or a gang of\r\nploughs. The latter method has been proposed for breaking up\r\nprairie-land.\r\n\r\nThus, thirty years after the defeat of the intelligent, courageous,\r\nand persistent Hancock and his coworkers in the scheme of applying the\r\nsteam-engine usefully on the common road, we find strong indications\r\nthat, in a new form, the problem has been again attacked, and at least\r\npartially solved.\r\n\r\nOne of the most important of the prerequisites to ultimate success in\r\nthe substitution of steam for animal power on the highway is that our\r\nroads shall be well made. As the greatest care and judgment are\r\nexercised, and an immense outlay of capital is considered justifiable,\r\nin securing easy grades and a smooth track on our railroad routes, we\r\nmay readily believe that similar precaution and outlay will be found\r\nadvisable in adapting the common road to the road-locomotive. It would\r\nseem to the engineer that the natural obstacles generally supposed to\r\nstand in the way have, after all, no real existence. The principal\r\ninconvenience that may be anticipated will probably arise from the\r\ncarelessness or avarice of proprietors, which may sometimes cause them\r\nto appoint ignorant and inefficient engine-drivers, giving them charge\r\nof what are always excellent servants, but terrible masters.\r\nNevertheless, as the transportation of passengers on railroads is\r\nfound to be attended with less liability to loss of life or injury of\r\nperson than their carriage by stage-coach, it will be found, very\r\nprobably, that the general use of steam in transporting freight on\r\ncommon roads may be attended with less risk to life or property than\r\nto-day attends the use of horse-power.\r\n\r\nThe STEAM FIRE-ENGINE is still another form of portable engine. It is\r\nalso one of the latest of all applications of steam-power. The steam\r\nfire-engine is peculiarly an American production. Although previously\r\nattempted, their permanently successful introduction has only occurred\r\nwithin the last fifteen years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 120.--The Latta Steam Fire-Engine.]\r\n\r\nAs early as 1830, Braithwaite and Ericsson, of London, England, built\r\nan engine with steam and pump cylinders of 7 and 6-1/2 inches\r\ndiameter, respectively, with 16 inches stroke of piston. This machine\r\nweighed 2-1/2 tons, and is said to have thrown 150 gallons of water\r\nper minute to a height of between 80 and 100 feet. It was ready for\r\nwork in about 20 minutes after lighting the fire. Braithwaite\r\nafterward supplied a more powerful engine to the King of Prussia, in\r\n1832. The first attempt made in the United States to construct a steam\r\nfire-engine was probably that of Hodge, who built one in New York in\r\n1841. It was a strong and very effective machine, but was far too\r\nheavy for rapid transportation. The late J. K. Fisher, who throughout\r\nhis life persistently urged the use of steam-carriages and\r\ntraction-engines, designing and building several, also planned a\r\nsteam fire-engine. Two were built from his design by the Novelty\r\nWorks, New York, about 1860, for Messrs. Lee & Larned. They were\r\n\"self-propellers,\" and one of them, built for the city of\r\nPhiladelphia, was sent to that city over the highway, driven by its\r\nown engines. The other was built for and used by the New York Fire\r\nDepartment, and did good service for several years. These engines were\r\nheavy, but very powerful, and were found to move at good speed under\r\nsteam and to man[oe]uvre well. The Messrs. Latta, of Cincinnati, soon\r\nafter succeeded in constructing comparatively light and very effective\r\nengines, and the fire department of that city was the first to adopt\r\nsteam fire-engines definitely as their principal reliance. This change\r\nhas now become general.\r\n\r\nThe steam fire-engine has now entirely displaced the old hand-engine\r\nin all large cities. It does its work at a fraction of the cost of the\r\nlatter. It can force its water to a height of 225 feet, and to a\r\ndistance of more than 300 feet horizontally, while the hand-engine can\r\nseldom throw it one-third these distances; and the \"steamer\" may be\r\nrelied upon to work at full power many hours if necessary, while the\r\nmen at the hand-engine soon become fatigued, and require frequent\r\nrelief. The city of New York has 40 steam fire-engines. One engine to\r\nevery 10,000 inhabitants is a proper proportion.\r\n\r\nIn the standard steam fire-engine (Fig. 120) reciprocating engines and\r\npumps are adopted, as seen in section in Fig. 121, in which _A_ is the\r\nfurnace, and _B_ the set of closely-set vertical fire-tubes in the\r\nboiler. _C_ is the combustion-chamber, _D_ the smoke-pipe, and _R_ the\r\nsteam-space. _E_ is the steam-cylinder, and _F_ the pump, which is\r\nseen to be double-acting. There are two pairs of engines and pumps,\r\nworking on cranks, set at right angles, and turning a balance-wheel\r\nseen behind them. _G_ is the feed-pump which supplies water to the\r\nboiler, _H_ the air-chamber which equalizes the water-pressure, which\r\nreaches it through the pipe, _I J_. _K_ is the feed-water tank, under\r\nthe driver's seat, _L_, which, with the engines and boiler, are\r\ncarried on the frame, _M M_. The fireman stands on the platform, _N_.\r\nWhen it is necessary to move the machine, an endless chain connects\r\nthe crank-shaft with the rear-wheels, and the engine, with pumps shut\r\noff, is thus made to drive the wheels at any desired speed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 121.--The Amoskeag Engine. Section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 122.--The Silsby Rotary Steam Fire-Engine.]\r\n\r\nA self-propelling engine by the Amoskeag Company had the following\r\ndimensions and performance: Weight, 4 tons; speed, 8 miles per hour;\r\nsteam-pressure, 75 pounds per square inch; height of stream from\r\n1-1/4-inch nozzle, 225 feet; 1-3/4-inch nozzle, 150 feet; distance\r\nhorizontally, 1-1/4-inch nozzle, 300 feet; 1-3/4-inch, 250 feet--a\r\nperformance which contrasts wonderfully with that of the hand-worked\r\nfire-engine which these engines have now superseded.\r\n\r\nIt has recently become common to construct the steam fire-engine with\r\nrotary engine and pump (Fig. 122). The superiority of a rotary motion\r\nfor a steam-engine is apparently so evident that many attempts have\r\nbeen made to overcome the practical difficulties to which it is\r\nsubject. One of these difficulties, and the principal one, has been\r\nthe packing of the part which performs the office of the piston in the\r\nstraight cylinder. Robert Stephenson once expressed the opinion that a\r\nrotary engine would never be made to work successfully, on account of\r\nthis difficulty of packing. The most palpable of the advantages of the\r\nrotary engine are the reduction in the size of the engine, claimed to\r\nresult from the great velocity of the piston; the avoidance of great\r\naccidental strains, especially noticed in propelling ships; and a\r\ngreat saving of the power which is asserted to be expended in the\r\nreciprocating engine in overcoming the inertia while changing the\r\ndirection of the motions. These advantages adapt the rotary engine, in\r\nan especial manner, to the driving of a locomotive or steam\r\nfire-engine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 123.--Rotary Steam-Engine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 124.--Rotary Pump.]\r\n\r\nIn the Holly rotary engine, seen in Fig. 123, eccentrics and\r\nsliding-cams, which are frequently used in rotary engines, and which\r\nare objectionable on account of their great friction, are avoided.\r\nCorrugated pistons, or irregular cams, _C D_, are adopted, forming\r\nchambers within the cases. In the engine the steam enters at _A_, at\r\nthe bottom of the case, and presses the cams apart. The only packing\r\nused is in the ends of the long metal cogs, which are ground to fit\r\nthe case and are kept out by the momentum of the cams, assisted by a\r\nslight spring back of the packing-pieces. The friction on the pump\r\n(Fig. 124) is said to be less than in the engine. This is the reason\r\ngiven in support of the claim that the rotary engine forces water to a\r\ngiven distance with from one-fourth to one-third the steam-pressure\r\nnecessary to drive all reciprocating engines. The smaller amount of\r\npower necessary to do the work, the less strain and consequent wear\r\nand tear upon the whole machine, are said to make it more durable and\r\nreliable. The pump being chambered, its liability to injury by the use\r\nof dirty or gritty water is lessened, and it is stated that it will\r\nlast for years, pumping gritty water that would soon cut out a\r\npiston-pump. The pump used with this engine is, as shown in the above\r\nillustration, somewhat similar to the rotary engine driving it. Each\r\nof the revolving pistons has three long teeth bearing against the\r\ncylinder, and packed, to prevent leakage, like the engine-cams. They\r\nare carried on steel shafts coupled to the engine-shafts. The water\r\nenters at _E_ and is discharged at _F_, and the passages are purposely\r\nmade large in order that sand, chips, and dirt, which may enter with\r\nthe water, may pass through.\r\n\r\nThe rotary engine is gradually coming into use for various special\r\npurposes, where small power is called for, and where economy of fuel\r\nis not important; but it has never yet competed, and may perhaps never\r\nin the future compete, with the reciprocating-piston engine where\r\nlarge engines are required, or where even moderate economy of fuel is\r\nessential. This form of engine has assumed so little importance, in\r\nfact, in the application of the steam-engine, that comparatively\r\nlittle is known of its history. Watt invented a rotary engine, and\r\nYule many years afterward (1836) constructed such engines at Glasgow.\r\nLamb patented another in 1842, Behrens still another in 1847. Napier,\r\nHall, Massey, Holly, La France, and others, have built engines of this\r\nclass in later times. Nearly all consist either of cams rotating in\r\ngear, as in those above sketched, or of a piston set radially in a\r\ncylinder of small diameter, which turns on its axis within a much\r\nlarger cylinder set eccentrically, the piston, as the former turns,\r\nsliding in and out of the smaller cylinder as its outer edge slides in\r\ncontact with the inner surface of the larger. In some forms of rotary\r\nengine, a piston revolves on a central shaft, and a sliding abutment\r\nin the external cylinder serves to separate the steam from the exhaust\r\nside and to confine the steam expanding while doing work. Nearly all\r\nof these combinations are also used as pumps.\r\n\r\nFire-engines, made by the best-known American builders of engines,\r\nwith reciprocating engines and pumps, such as are in general use in\r\nthe United States, have become standard in general plan and\r\narrangement of details. These are probably the best illustrations of\r\nextreme lightness, combined with strength of parts and working power,\r\nwhich have ever been produced in any branch of mechanical\r\nengineering. By using a small boiler crowded with heating-surface,\r\nvery carefully proportioned and arranged, and with small water-spaces;\r\nby adopting steel for running-gear and working parts wherever\r\npossible; by working at high piston-speed and with high\r\nsteam-pressure; by selecting fuel with extreme care--by all these\r\nexpedients, the steam fire-engine has been brought, in this country,\r\nto a state of efficiency far superior to anything seen elsewhere.\r\nSteam is raised with wonderful promptness, even from cold water, and\r\nwater is thrown from the nozzle at the end of long lines of hose to\r\ngreat distances. But this combination of lightness with power is only\r\nattained at the expense of a certain regularity of action which can\r\nonly be secured by greater water and steam capacity in the boiler. The\r\nsmall quantity of water contained within the boiler makes it necessary\r\nto give constant attention to the feed, and the tendency, almost\r\ninvariably observed, to serious foaming and priming not only compels\r\nunintermitted care while running, but even introduces an element of\r\ndanger which is not to be despised, even though the machine be in\r\ncharge of the most experienced and skillful attendants. Even the\r\ngreatest care, directed by the utmost skill, would not avail to\r\nprevent frequent explosions, were it not for the fact that it rarely,\r\nif ever, happens that accidents to such boilers occur from low water,\r\nunless the boiler is actually completely emptied of water. In driving\r\nthem at fires, they frequently foam so violently that it is utterly\r\nimpossible to obtain any clew to the amount of water present, and the\r\nattendant usually keeps his feed-pump on and allows the foaming to go\r\non. As long as water is passing into the boiler it is very unlikely\r\nthat any portion will become overheated and that accident will occur.\r\nSuch management appears very reckless, and yet accident from such a\r\ncause is exceedingly rare.\r\n\r\nThe changes which have been made in LOCOMOTIVE-CONSTRUCTION during the\r\npast few years have also been in the direction of the refinement of\r\nthe earlier designs, and have been accompanied by corresponding\r\nchanges in all branches of railroad-work. The adjustment of parts to\r\neach other and proportioning them to their work, the modification of\r\nthe minor details to suit changes of general dimensions, the\r\nimprovement of workmanship, and the use of better material, have\r\nsignalized this latest period. Special forms of engine have been\r\ndevised for special kinds of work. Small, light tank-engines (Fig.\r\n125), carrying their own fuel and water without \"tenders,\" are used\r\nfor moving cars about terminal stations and for making up trains;\r\npowerful, heavy, slow-moving engines, of large boiler-capacity and\r\nwith small wheels, are used on steep gradients and for hauling long\r\ntrains laden with coal and heavy merchandise; and hardly less powerful\r\nbut quite differently proportioned \"express\"-engines are used for\r\npassenger and mail service.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 125.--Tank-Engine, New York Elevated Railroad.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 126.--Forney's Tank-Locomotive.]\r\n\r\nA peculiar form of engine (Fig. 126) has been designed by Forney, in\r\nwhich the whole weight of engine, tender, coal, and water, is carried\r\nby one frame and on one set of wheels, the permanent weight falling on\r\nthe driving-wheels and the variable load on the truck. These engines\r\nhave also a comparatively short wheel-base and high pulling-power. The\r\nlightest tank-engines of the first class mentioned weigh 8 or 10 tons;\r\nbut engines much lighter than these, even, are built for mines, where\r\nthey are sent into the galleries to bring out the coal-laden wagons.\r\nThe heaviest engines of this class attain weights of 20 or 30 tons.\r\nThe heaviest engine yet constructed in the United States is said to be\r\none in use on the Philadelphia & Reading Railroad, having a weight of\r\nabout 100,000 pounds, which is carried on 12 driving-wheels.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 127.--British Express Engine.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 128.--The Baldwin Locomotive. Section.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 129.--The American Type of Express-Engine, 1878.]\r\n\r\nA locomotive has two steam-cylinders, either side by side within the\r\nframe, and immediately beneath the forward end of the boiler, or on\r\neach side and exterior to the frame. The engines are non-condensing,\r\nand of the simplest possible construction. The whole machine is\r\ncarried upon strong but flexible steel springs. The steam-pressure is\r\nusually more than 100 pounds. The pulling-power is generally about\r\none-fifth the weight under most favorable conditions, and becomes as\r\nlow as one-tenth on wet rails. The fuel employed is wood in new\r\ncountries, coke in bituminous coal districts, and anthracite coal in\r\nthe eastern part of the United States. The general arrangement and the\r\nproportions of locomotives differ somewhat in different localities.\r\nIn Fig. 127, a British express-engine, _O_ is the boiler, _N_ the\r\nfire-box, _X_ the grate, _G_ the smoke-box, and _P_ the chimney. _S_\r\nis a spring and _R_ a lever safety-valve, _T_ is the whistle, _L_ the\r\nthrottle or regulator valve, _E_ the steam-cylinder, and _W_ the\r\ndriving-wheel. The force-pump, _B C_, is driven from the cross-head,\r\n_D_. The frame is the base of the whole system, and all other parts\r\nare firmly secured to it. The boiler is made fast at one end, and\r\nprovision is made for its expansion when heated. Adhesion is\r\nsecured by throwing a proper proportion of the weight upon the\r\ndriving-wheel, _W_. This is from about 6,000 pounds on standard\r\nfreight-engines, having several pairs of drivers, to 10,000 pounds on\r\npassenger-engines, per axle. The peculiarities of the American type\r\n(Fig. 128) are the truck, _I J_, or bogie, supporting the forward part\r\nof the engine, the system of equalizers, or beams which distribute the\r\nweight of the machine equally over the several axles, and minor\r\ndifferences of detail. The cab or house, _r_, protecting the\r\nengine-driver and fireman, is an American device, which is gradually\r\ncoming into use abroad also. The American locomotive is distinguished\r\nby its flexibility and ease of action upon even roughly-laid roads. In\r\nthe sketch, which shows a standard American engine in section, _A B_\r\nis the boiler, _C_ one of the steam-cylinders, _D_ the piston, _E_ the\r\ncross-head, connected to the crank-shaft, _F_, by the connecting-rod,\r\n_G H_ the driving-wheels, _I J_ the truck-wheels, carrying the truck,\r\n_K L_; _N N_ is the fire-box, _O O_ the tubes, of which but four are\r\nshown. The steam-pipe, _R S_, leads the steam to the valve-chest, _T_,\r\nin which is seen the valve, moved by the valve-gear, _U V_, and the\r\nlink, _W_. The link is raised or depressed by a lever, _X_, moved from\r\nthe cab. The safety-valve is seen at the top of the dome, at _Y_, and\r\nthe spring-balance by which the load is adjusted is shown at _Z_. At\r\n_a_ is the cone-shaped exhaust-pipe, by which a good draught is\r\nsecured. The attachments _b_, _c_, _d_, _e_, _f_, _g_--whistle,\r\nsteam-gauge, sand-box, bell, head-light, and \"cow-catcher\"--are nearly\r\nall peculiar, either in construction or location, to the American\r\nlocomotive. The cost of passenger-locomotives of ordinary size is\r\nabout $12,000; heavier engines sometimes cost $20,000. The locomotive\r\nis usually furnished with a tender, which carries its fuel and water.\r\nThe standard passenger-engine on the Pennsylvania Railroad has four\r\ndriving-wheels, 5-1/2 feet diameter; steam-cylinders, 17 inches\r\ndiameter and 2 feet stroke; grate-surface 15-1/2 square feet, and\r\nheating-surface 1,058 square feet. It weighs 63,100 pounds, of which\r\n39,000 pounds are on the drivers and 24,100 on the truck. The\r\nfreight-engine has six driving-wheels, 54-5/8 inches in diameter. The\r\nsteam-cylinders are 18 inches in diameter, stroke 22 inches,\r\ngrate-surface 14.8 square feet, heating-surface 1,096 feet. It weighs\r\n68,500 pounds, of which 48,000 are on the drivers and 20,500 on the\r\ntruck. The former takes a train of five cars up an average grade of 90\r\nfeet to the mile. The latter is attached to a train of 11 cars. On a\r\ngrade of 50 feet to the mile, the former takes 7 and the latter 17\r\ncars. Tank-engines for very heavy work, such as on grades of 320 feet\r\nto the mile, which are found on some of the mountain lines of road,\r\nare made with five pairs of driving-wheels, and with no truck. The\r\nsteam-cylinders are 20-1/8 inches in diameter, 2 feet stroke;\r\ngrate-area, 15-3/4 feet; heating-surface, 1,380 feet; weight with tank\r\nfull, and full supply of wood, 112,000 pounds; average weight, 108,000\r\npounds. Such an engine has hauled 110 tons up this grade at the speed\r\nof 5 miles an hour, the steam-pressure being 145 pounds. The adhesion\r\nwas about 23 per cent. of the weight.\r\n\r\nIn checking a train in motion, the inertia of the engine itself\r\nabsorbs a seriously large portion of the work of the brakes. This is\r\nsometimes reduced by reversing the engine and allowing the\r\nsteam-pressure to act in aid of the brakes. To avoid injury by\r\nabrasion of the surfaces of piston, cylinder, and the valves and\r\nvalve-seats, M. Le Chatelier introduces a jet of steam into the\r\nexhaust-passages when reversing, and thus prevents the ingress of\r\ndust-laden air and the drying of the rubbing surfaces. This method of\r\nchecking a train is rarely resorted to, however, except in case of\r\ndanger. The introduction of the \"continuous\" or \"air\" brake, which can\r\nbe thrown into action in an instant on every car of the train by the\r\nengine-driver, is so efficient that it is now almost universally\r\nadopted. It is one of the most important safeguards which American\r\ningenuity has yet devised. In drawing a train weighing 150 tons at the\r\nrate of 60 miles an hour, about 800 effective horse-power is required.\r\nA speed of 80 miles an hour has been often attained, and 100 miles has\r\nprobably been reached.\r\n\r\nThe American locomotive-engine has a maximum life which may be stated\r\nat about 30 years. The annual cost of repairs is from 10 to 15 per\r\ncent. of its first cost. On moderately level roads, the engine\r\nrequires a pint of oil to each 25 miles, and a ton of coal to each 40\r\nor 50 miles run. One of the best-managed railroads in the United\r\nStates reports expenses as follows for one month:\r\n\r\n  Number \"train-miles\" run per ton of coal burned    53.95\r\n    \"         \"         \"   \"  quart of oil used     34.44\r\n  Passenger-cars hauled 1 mile per ton of coal      275.7\r\n  Other      \"     \"      \"       \"        \"        634.8\r\n  Cost repairs per mile run                          $2 43\r\n   \"   fuel       \"      \"                            3 64\r\n   \"   oil and waste per mile run                       62\r\n   \"   wages of engine-men per mile run               6 22\r\n  All other expenses per mile                         1 91\r\n  Total cost per \"train-mile\" run                    14 82\r\n\r\nAlthough the above sketch and description represent the construction\r\nand performance of the standard locomotive of the present time, there\r\nare indications that the compound arrangement of engines will\r\nultimately be adopted. This will involve a considerable change of\r\nproportions, greatly increasing the volume and weight of\r\nsteam-cylinders, but enabling the designer to more than proportionally\r\ndecrease the weight of boiler and the quantity of fuel carried. There\r\nis no serious objection to their use, however, and no insuperable\r\ndifficulty in the construction of the \"double-cylinder\" type of engine\r\nfor the locomotive. A few such engines have already been put in\r\nservice. In these engines the high-pressure cylinder is placed on one\r\nside and the larger low-pressure cylinder on the other side of the\r\nlocomotive, thus having but two cylinders, as in the older plan. The\r\nvalve-gear is the Stephenson link, as in the ordinary engine. At\r\nstarting, the steam is allowed to act on both pistons; but after a few\r\nrevolutions the course of the steam is changed, and the exhaust from\r\nthe smaller cylinder, instead of passing into the chimney, is sent to\r\nthe larger cylinder, which is at the same time cut off from the main\r\nsteam-pipe. When the engine is ascending a steep gradient the steam\r\nmay, if necessary, be taken from the boiler into both cylinders, as\r\nwhen starting. Compound engines of this kind have been used on the\r\nFrench line of railroad from Bayonne to Biarritz. They were designed\r\nby Mallet and built at Le Creuzot. The steam-cylinders are of 9-1/2\r\nand 15-3/4 inches diameter, and of 17-3/4 inches stroke of piston. The\r\nfour driving-wheels are 4 feet in diameter, and the total weight of\r\nengine is 20 tons. The boiler has 484-1/2 square feet of\r\nheating-surface, and is built to carry 10 atmospheres pressure. When\r\nhauling trains of 50 tons at 25 miles an hour, these engines require\r\nabout 15 pounds of good coal per mile.\r\n\r\nThe total length of the railways in operation in the United States on\r\nthe 1st day of January, 1877, was 76,640 miles,[93] being an average\r\nof one mile of railway for every 600 inhabitants. The railways are as\r\nfollows:\r\n\r\n  [93] January, 1884, over 120,000 miles.\r\n\r\n                     Miles.\r\n\r\n  Alabama             1,722\r\n  Alaska                  0\r\n  Arizona                 0\r\n  Arkansas              787\r\n  California          1,854\r\n  Colorado              950\r\n  Connecticut           925\r\n  Dakota                290\r\n  Delaware              285\r\n  Florida               484\r\n  Georgia             2,308\r\n  Idaho                   0\r\n  Illinois            6,980\r\n  Indiana             4,072\r\n  Indian Territory      281\r\n  Iowa                3,937\r\n  Kansas              3,226\r\n  Kentucky            1,464\r\n  Louisiana             539\r\n  Maine                 987\r\n  Maryland            1,092\r\n  Massachusetts       1,825\r\n  Michigan            3,437\r\n  Minnesota           2,024\r\n  Mississippi         1,028\r\n  Missouri            3,016\r\n  Montana                 0\r\n  Nebraska            1,181\r\n  Nevada                714\r\n  New Hampshire         942\r\n  New Jersey          1,594\r\n  New Mexico              0\r\n  New York            5,520\r\n  North Carolina      1,371\r\n  Ohio                4,680\r\n  Oregon                251\r\n  Pennsylvania        5,896\r\n  Rhode Island          182\r\n  South Carolina      1,352\r\n  Tennessee           1,638\r\n  Texas               2,072\r\n  Utah                  486\r\n  Vermont               810\r\n  Virginia            1,648\r\n  Washington            110\r\n  West Virginia         576\r\n  Wisconsin           2,575\r\n  Wyoming               459\r\n                     ------\r\n    Total            76,640\r\n\r\nIn 1873 came the great financial crisis, with its terrible results of\r\ninterrupted production, poverty, and starvation, and an almost total\r\ncessation of the work of building new railroads. The largest number of\r\nmiles ever built in any one year were constructed in 1872. The\r\ngreatest mileage is in Illinois, reaching 6,589; the smallest in Rhode\r\nIsland, 136, and in Washington Territory, 110. The State of\r\nMassachusetts has one mile of railroad to 4.86 miles of territory,\r\nthis ratio being the greatest in the country. The longest road in\r\noperation is the Chicago & Northwestern, extending 1,500 miles; the\r\nshortest, the Little Saw-Mill Run Road in Pennsylvania, which is but\r\nthree miles in length. The total capital of railways in the country is\r\n$6,000,000,000, or an average of $100,000 per mile. The earnings for\r\nthe year 1872 amounted to $454,969,000, or $7,500 per mile. The\r\nlargest net earnings recorded as made on any road were gained by the\r\nNew York Central & Hudson River, $8,260,827; the smallest on several\r\nroads which not only earned nothing, but incurred a loss.\r\n\r\nThe catastrophe of 1873-'74 revealed the fact that the latter\r\ncondition of railroad finances was vastly more common than had been\r\nsuspected; and it is still doubtful whether the existing immense\r\nnetwork of railroads which covers the United States can be made, as a\r\nwhole, to pay even a moderate return on the money invested in their\r\nconstruction. At the period of maximum rate of extension of railroads\r\nin the United States--1873--the reported lengths of the railroads of\r\nEurope and America were as follows:[94]\r\n\r\n  [94] _Railroad Gazette._\r\n\r\n              RAILROADS IN EUROPE AND AMERICA IN 1873.\r\n\r\n  ----------------------------+------------+-------------+------------\r\n       COUNTRIES.             | Railroads, | Population. |   Area,\r\n                              |   Miles.   |             | Sq.

This sum is equal to five times the amount of the\r\nannual value of all the real property in Great Britain, and two-thirds\r\nof the national debt. After deducting all the working expenses, the\r\ngross net annual revenue of all the roads exceeds by $110,000,000 the\r\ntotal revenue from all sources of Belgium, Holland, Portugal, Denmark,\r\nSweden and Norway. An army of 100,000 officers and servants is in the\r\nemploy of the companies, and the value of the rolling-stock exceeds\r\n$150,000,000.\r\n\r\n\r\nSECTION III.--MARINE ENGINES.\r\n\r\nThe changes which have now become completed in the marine steam-engine\r\nhave been effected at a later date than those which produced the\r\nmodern locomotive. On the American rivers the modification of the\r\nbeam-engine since the time of Robert L. Stevens has been very slight.\r\nThe same general arrangement is retained, and the details are little,\r\nif at all, altered. The pressure of steam is sometimes as high as 60\r\npounds per square inch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 130.--Beam-Engine.]\r\n\r\nThe valves are of the disk or poppet variety, rising and falling\r\nvertically. They are four in number, two steam and two exhaust valves\r\nbeing placed at each end of the steam-cylinder. The beam-engine is a\r\npeculiarly American type, seldom if ever seen abroad. Fig. 130 is an\r\noutline sketch of this engine as built for a steamer plying on the\r\nHudson River. This class of engine is usually adopted in vessels of\r\ngreat length, light draught, and high speed. But one steam-cylinder is\r\ncommonly used. The cross-head is coupled to one end of the beam by\r\nmeans of a pair of links, and the motion of the opposite end of the\r\nbeam is transmitted to the crank by a connecting-rod of moderate\r\nlength. The beam has a cast-iron centre surrounded by a wrought-iron\r\nstrap of lozenge shape, in which are forged the bosses for the\r\nend-centres, or for the pins to which the connecting-rod and the links\r\nare attached. The main centre of the beam is supported by a\r\n\"gallows-frame\" of timbers so arranged as to receive all stresses\r\nlongitudinally. The crank and shaft are of wrought-iron. The\r\nvalve-gear is usually of the form already mentioned as the Stevens\r\nvalve-gear, the invention of Robert L. and Francis B. Stevens. The\r\ncondenser is placed immediately beneath the steam-cylinder. The\r\nair-pump is placed close beside it, and worked by a rod attached to\r\nthe beam. Steam-vessels on the Hudson River have been driven by such\r\nengines at the rate of 20 miles an hour. This form of engine is\r\nremarkable for its smoothness of operation, its economy and\r\ndurability, its compactness, and the latitude which it permits in the\r\nchange of shape of the long, flexible vessels in which it is generally\r\nused, without injury by \"getting out of line.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 131.--Oscillating Engine and Feathering\r\nPaddle-Wheel.]\r\n\r\nFor paddle-engines of large vessels, the favorite type, which has been\r\nthe side-lever engine, is now rarely built. For smaller vessels, the\r\noscillating engine with feathering paddle-wheels is still largely\r\nemployed in Europe. This style of engine is shown in Fig. 131. It is\r\nvery compact, light, and moderately economical, and excels in\r\nsimplicity. The usual arrangement is such that the feathering-wheel\r\nhas the same action upon the water as a radial wheel of double\r\ndiameter. This reduction of the diameter of the wheel, while retaining\r\nmaximum effectiveness, permits a high speed of engine, and therefore\r\nless weight, volume, and cost. The smaller wheel-boxes, by offering\r\nless resistance to the wind, retard the progress of the vessel less\r\nthan those of radial wheels. Inclined engines are sometimes used for\r\ndriving paddle-wheels. In these the steam-cylinder lies in an inclined\r\nposition, and its connecting-rod directly connects the crank with the\r\ncross-head. The condenser and air-pump usually lie beneath the\r\ncross-head guides, and are worked by a bell-crank driven by links on\r\neach side the connecting-rod, attached to the cross-head. Such engines\r\nare used to some extent in Europe, and they have been adopted in the\r\nUnited States navy for side-wheel gunboats. They are also used on the\r\nferry-boats plying between New York and Brooklyn.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 132.--The Two Rhode Islands, 1836-1876.]\r\n\r\nAmong the finest illustrations of recent practice in the construction\r\nof side-wheel steamers are those built for the several routes between\r\nNew York and the cities of New England which traverse Long Island\r\nSound. Our illustration exhibits the form of these vessels, and also\r\nshows well the modifications in structure and size which have been\r\nmade during this generation. The later vessel is 325 feet long, 45\r\nfeet beam, 80 feet wide over the \"guards,\" and 16 feet deep, drawing\r\n10 feet of water. The \"frames\" upon which the planking of the hull is\r\nfastened are of white-oak, and the lighter and \"top\" timbers of cedar\r\nand locust. The engine has a steam-cylinder 90 inches in diameter and\r\n12 feet stroke of piston.[95] On each side the great saloons which\r\nextend from end to end of the upper deck are state-rooms, containing\r\neach two berths and elegantly furnished. The engine of this vessel is\r\ncapable of developing about 2,500 horse-power. The great wheels, of\r\nwhich the paddle-boxes are seen rising nearly to the height of the\r\nhurricane-deck, are 37-1/2 feet in diameter and 12 in breadth. The\r\nhull of this vessel, including all wood-work, weighs over 1,200 tons.\r\nThe weight of the machinery is about 625 tons. The steamer makes 16\r\nknots an hour when the engine is at its best speed--about 17\r\nrevolutions per minute--and its average speed is about 14 knots on\r\nits route of 160 miles. The coal required to supply the furnaces of\r\nsuch a vessel and with such machinery would be about 3 tons per hour.\r\nor a little over 2-1/2 pounds per horse-power. The construction of\r\nsuch a vessel occupies, usually, about a year, and costs a quarter of\r\na million dollars.\r\n\r\n  [95] The steam-cylinders of the engines of steamers Bristol and\r\n  Providence are 110 inches in diameter and of 12 feet stroke.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 133.--A Mississippi Steamboat.]\r\n\r\nThe non-condensing direct-acting engine is used principally on the\r\nWestern rivers, driven by steam of from 100 to 150 pounds pressure,\r\nand exhausts its steam into the atmosphere. It is the simplest\r\npossible form of direct-acting engine. The valves are usually of the\r\n\"poppet\" variety, and are operated by cams which act at the ends of\r\nlong levers having their fulcra on the opposite side of the valve, the\r\nstem of which latter is attached at an intermediate point. The engine\r\nis horizontal, and the connecting-rod directly attached to cross-head\r\nand crank-pin without intermediate mechanism. The paddle-wheel is\r\nused, sometimes as a stern-wheel, as in the plan of Jonathan Hulls of\r\none and a half century ago, sometimes as a side-wheel, as is most\r\nusual elsewhere. One of the most noted of these steamers, plying on\r\nthe Mississippi, is shown in the preceding sketch.\r\n\r\nOne of the largest of these steamers was the Grand Republic,[96] a\r\nvessel 340 feet long, 56 feet beam, and 10-1/4 feet depth. The draught\r\nof water of this great craft was 3-1/2 feet forward and 4-1/2 aft. The\r\ntwo sets of compound engines, 28 and 56 inches diameter and of 10 feet\r\nstroke, drive wheels 38-1/2 feet in diameter and 18 feet wide. The\r\nboilers were steel. A steamer built still later on the Ohio has the\r\nfollowing dimensions: Length, 225 feet; breadth, 35-1/2 feet; depth, 5\r\nfeet; cylinders, 17-3/8 inches in diameter, 6 feet stroke; three\r\nboilers. The hull and cabin were built at Jeffersonville, Ind. She has\r\n40 large state-rooms. The cost of the steamer was $40,000.\r\n\r\n  [96] Burned in 1877.\r\n\r\nThese vessels have now opened to commerce the whole extent of the\r\ngreat Mississippi basin, transporting a large share of the products of\r\na section of country measuring a million and a half square miles--an\r\narea equal to many times that of New York State, and twelve times that\r\nof the island of Great Britain--an area exceeding that of the whole of\r\nEurope, exclusive of Russia and Turkey, and capable, if as thoroughly\r\ncultivated as the Netherlands, of supporting a population of between\r\nthree and four hundred millions of people.\r\n\r\nThe steam-engine and propelling apparatus of the modern ocean-steamer\r\nhave now become almost exclusively the compound or double-cylinder\r\nengine, driving the screw. The form and the location of the machinery\r\nin the vessel vary with the size and character of the ship which it\r\ndrives. Very small boats are fitted with machinery of quite a\r\ndifferent kind from that built for large steamers, and war-vessels\r\nhave usually been supplied with engines of a design radically\r\ndifferent from that adopted for merchant-steamers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 134.--Steam-Launch, New York Steam-Power Company.]\r\n\r\nThe introduction of _Steam-Launches_ and small pleasure-boats driven\r\nby steam-power is of comparatively recent date, but their use is\r\nrapidly increasing. Those first built were heavy, slow, and\r\ncomplicated; but, profiting by experience, light and graceful boats\r\nare now built, of remarkable swiftness, and having such improved and\r\nsimplified machinery that they require little fuel and can be easily\r\nmanaged. Such boats have strong, carefully-modeled hulls, light and\r\nstrong boilers, capable of making a large amount of dry steam with\r\nlittle fuel, and a light, quick-running engine, working without shake\r\nor jar, and using steam economically.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 135.--Launch-Engine.]\r\n\r\nThe above sketch represents the engine built by a New York firm for\r\nsuch little craft. This is the smallest size made for the market. It\r\nhas a steam-cylinder 3 inches in diameter and a stroke of piston of 5\r\ninches, driving a screw 26 inches in diameter and of 3 feet pitch. The\r\nmaximum power of the engine is four or five times the nominal power.\r\nThe boiler is of the form shown in the illustrations of semi-portable\r\nengines, and has a heating-surface, in this case, of 75 square feet.\r\nThe boat itself is like that seen on page 386, and is 25 feet long, of\r\n5 feet 8 inches beam, and draws 2-1/4 feet of water. These little\r\nmachines weigh about 150 pounds per nominal horse-power, and the\r\nboilers about 300.\r\n\r\nSome of these little vessels have attained wonderful speed. A British\r\nsteam-yacht, the Miranda, 45-1/2 feet in length, 5-3/4 feet wide, and\r\ndrawing 2-1/2 feet of water, with a total weight of 3-3/4 tons, has\r\nsteamed nearly 18-1/2 miles an hour for short runs. The boat was\r\ndriven by an engine of 6 inches diameter of cylinder and 8 inches\r\nstroke of piston, making 600 revolutions per minute, driving a\r\ntwo-bladed screw 2-1/2 feet in diameter and of 3-1/3 feet pitch. Its\r\nmachinery had a total weight of two tons. Another English yacht, the\r\nFirefly, is said to have made 18.94 miles an hour. A little French\r\nyacht, the Hirondelle, has attained a speed of 16 knots, equal to\r\nabout 18-1/2 miles, an hour. This was, however, a much larger vessel\r\nthan the preceding. One of the most remarkable of these little\r\nsteamers is a torpedo-boat built for the United States navy. This\r\nvessel is 60 feet long, 6 feet wide, and 5 feet deep; its screw is 38\r\ninches in diameter and of 5 feet pitch, two-bladed, and is driven, by\r\na very light engine and boiler, 400 revolutions per minute, the boat\r\nattaining a speed of 19 to 20 miles an hour. Another little vessel,\r\nthe Vision, made nearly as great speed, developing 20 horse-power with\r\nengine and boiler weighing but about 400 pounds.\r\n\r\nYachts of high speed require such weight and bulk of engine that but\r\nlittle space is left for cabins, and they are usually exceedingly\r\nuncomfortable vessels. In the Miranda the weight of machinery is more\r\nthan one-half the total weight of the whole. An illustration of the\r\nmore comfortable and more generally liked pleasure-yacht is the Day\r\nDream. The length is 105 feet, and the boat draws 5-1/2 feet of\r\nwater. There are two engines, having steam-cylinders 14 inches in\r\ndiameter and of the same length of stroke, direct-acting, condensing,\r\nand driving a screw, of 7 feet diameter and of 10-1/2 feet pitch, 135\r\nrevolutions a minute, giving the yacht a speed of 13-1/2 knots an\r\nhour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 136.--Horizontal, Direct-acting Naval\r\nScrew-Engine.]\r\n\r\nIn larger vessels, as in yachts, in nearly all cases, the ordinary\r\nscrew-engine is direct-acting. Two engines are placed side by side,\r\nwith cranks on the shaft at an angle of 90 deg. with each other. In\r\nmerchant-steamers the steam-cylinders are usually vertical and\r\ndirectly over the crank-pins, to which the cross-heads are coupled.\r\nThe condenser is placed behind the engine-frame, or, where a\r\njet-condenser is used, the frame itself is sometimes made hollow, and\r\nserves as a condenser. The air-pump is worked by a beam connected by\r\nlinks with the cross-head. The general arrangement is like that shown\r\nin Figs. 137 and 138. For naval purposes such a form is objectionable,\r\nsince its height is so great that it would be exposed to injury by\r\nshot. In naval engineering the cylinder is placed horizontally, as in\r\nFig. 136, which is a sectional view, representing an horizontal,\r\ndirect-acting naval screw-engine, with jet-condenser and double-acting\r\nair and circulating pumps. _A_ is the steam-cylinder, _B_ the piston,\r\nwhich is connected to the crank-pin by the piston-rod, _D_, and\r\nconnecting-rod, _E_. _F_ is the cross-head guide. The eccentrics,\r\n_G_, operate the valve, which is of the \"three-ported variety,\" by a\r\nStephenson link. Reversing is effected by the hand-wheel, _C_, which,\r\nby means of a gear, _m_, and a rack, _k_, elevates and depresses the\r\nlink, and thus reverses the valve.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 137.--Compound Marine Engine. Side Elevation.]\r\n\r\nThe trunk-engine, in which the connecting-rod is attached directly to\r\nthe piston and vibrates within a trunk or cylinder secured to the\r\npiston, moving with it, and extending outside the cylinder, like an\r\nimmense hollow piston-rod, is frequently used in the British navy. It\r\nhas rarely been adopted in the United States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 138.--Compound Marine Engine. Front Elevation and\r\nSection.]\r\n\r\nIn nearly all steam-vessels which have been built for the merchant\r\nservice recently, and in some naval vessels, the compound engine has\r\nbeen adopted. Figs. 137 and 138 represent the usual form of this\r\nengine. Here _A A_, _B B_ are the small and the large, or the\r\nhigh-pressure and the low-pressure cylinders respectively. _C C_ are\r\nthe valve-chests. _G G_ is the condenser, which is invariably a\r\nsurface-condenser. The condensing water is sometimes directed around\r\nthe tubes contained within the casing, _G G_, while the steam is\r\nexhausted around them and among them, and sometimes the steam is\r\ncondensed within the tubes, while the injection-water which is sent\r\ninto the condenser to produce condensation passes around the exterior\r\nof the tubes. In either case, the tubes are usually of small diameter,\r\nvarying from five-eighths to half an inch, and in length from four to\r\nseven feet. The extent of heating-surface is usually from one-half to\r\nthree-fourths that of the heating-surface of the boilers.\r\n\r\nThe air and circulating pumps are placed on the lower part of the\r\ncondenser-casting, and are operated by a crank on the main shaft at\r\n_N_; or they are sometimes placed as in the style of engine last\r\ndescribed, and driven by a beam worked by the cross-head. The\r\npiston-rods, _T S_, are guided by the cross-heads, _V V_, working in\r\nslipper-guides, and to these cross-heads are attached the\r\nconnecting-rods, _X X_, driving the cranks, _M M_. The cranks are now\r\nusually set at right angles; in some engines this angle is increased\r\nto 120 deg., or even 180 deg.. Where it is arranged as here shown, an\r\nintermediate reservoir, _P O_, is placed between the two cylinders to\r\nprevent the excessive variations of pressure that would otherwise\r\naccompany the varying relative motions of the pistons, as the steam\r\npasses from the high-pressure to the low-pressure cylinder. Steam from\r\nthe boilers enters the high-pressure steam-chest, _X_, and is admitted\r\nby the steam-valve alternately above and below the piston as usual.\r\nThe exhaust steam is conducted through the exhaust passage around into\r\nthe reservoir, _P_, whence it it is taken by the low-pressure\r\ncylinder, precisely as the smaller cylinder drew its steam from the\r\nboiler. From the large or low-pressure cylinder the steam is exhausted\r\ninto the condenser. The valve-gear is usually a Stephenson link, _g\r\ne_, the position of which is determined, and the reversal of which is\r\naccomplished, by a hand-wheel, _o_, and screw, _m n p_, which, by the\r\nbell-crank, _k i_, are attached to the link, _g e_. The \"box-framing\"\r\nforms also the hot-well. The surface-condenser is cleared by a\r\nsingle-acting air-pump, inside the frame, at _T_. The feed-pump and\r\nthe bilge-pumps are driven from the cross-head of the air-pump.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: John Elder.]\r\n\r\nThe successful introduction of the double-cylinder engine was finally\r\naccomplished by the exertions of a few engineers, who were at once\r\nintelligent enough to understand its advantages, and energetic and\r\nenterprising enough to push it forward in spite of active opposition,\r\nand powerful enough, pecuniarily and in influence, to succeed. The\r\nmost active and earnest of these eminent men was John Elder, of the\r\nfirm of Randolph, Elder & Co., subsequently John Elder & Co., of\r\nGlasgow.[97]\r\n\r\n  [97] _Vide_ \"Memoir of John Elder,\" W. J. M. Rankine, Glasgow, 1871.\r\n\r\nElder was of Scotch descent. His ancestors had, for generations,\r\nshown great skill and talent in construction, and had always been\r\nknown as successful millwrights. John Elder was born at Glasgow, March\r\n8, 1824, and died in London, September 17, 1869. He was educated at\r\nthe Glasgow High-School and in the College of Engineering at the\r\nUniversity of Glasgow, where, however, his attendance was but for a\r\nshort time. He learned the trade under his father in the workshops of\r\nthe Messrs. Napier, and became an unusually expert draughtsman. After\r\nspending three years in charge of the drawing-office at the\r\nengine-building works of Robert Napier, where his father had been\r\nmanager, Elder became a partner in the firm which had previously been\r\nknown as Randolph, Elliott & Co., in the year 1852. The firm commenced\r\nbuilding iron vessels in 1860.\r\n\r\nIn the mean time, the experiments of Hornblower and Wolff, of Allaire\r\nand Smith, and of McNaught, Craddock, and Nicholson, together with the\r\ntheoretical investigations of Thompson, Rankine, Clausius, and others,\r\nhad shown plainly in what direction to look for improvement upon then\r\nstandard engines, and what direction practice was taking with all\r\ntypes. The practical deductions which were becoming evident were\r\nrecognized very early by Elder, and he promptly began to put in\r\npractice the principles which his knowledge of thermo-dynamics and of\r\nmechanics enabled him to appreciate. He adopted the compound engine,\r\nand coupled his cranks at angles of 180 deg., in order to avoid losses due\r\nto the friction of the crank-shaft in its bearings, by effecting a\r\npartial counterbalancing of pressures on the journals. Elder was one\r\nof the first to point out the fact that the compound engine had proved\r\nitself more efficient than the single-cylinder engine, only when the\r\npressure of steam carried and the extent to which expansion was\r\nadopted exceeded the customary practice of his time. His own practice\r\nwas, from the first, successful, and from 1853 to 1867 he and his\r\npartners were continually engaged in the construction of steamers and\r\nfitting them with compound engines.\r\n\r\nThe engines of their first vessel, the Brandon, required but 3-1/4\r\npounds of coal per hour and per horse-power, in 1854, when the usual\r\nconsumption was a third more. Five years later, they had built engines\r\nwhich consumed a third less than those of the Brandon; and\r\nthenceforward, for many years, their engines, when of large size,\r\nexhibited what was then thought remarkable economy, running on a\r\nconsumption of from 2-1/4 to 2-1/2 pounds.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1865 the British Government ordered a competitive trial of\r\nthree naval vessels, which only differed in the form of their engines.\r\nThe Arethusa was fitted with trunk-engines of the ordinary kind; the\r\nOctavia had three steam-cylinders, coupled to three cranks placed at\r\nangles of 120 deg. with each other; and the Constance was fitted with\r\ncompound engines, two sets of three cylinders each, and each taking\r\nsteam from the boiler into one cylinder, passing it through the other\r\ntwo with continuous expansion, and finally exhausting from the third\r\ninto the condenser. These vessels, during one week's steaming at sea,\r\naveraged, respectively, 3.64, 3.17, and 2.51 pounds of coal per hour\r\nand per horse-power, and the Constance showed a marked superiority in\r\nthe efficiency of the mechanism of her engines, when the losses by\r\nfriction were compared.\r\n\r\nThe change from the side-lever single-cylinder engine, with\r\njet-condenser and paddle-wheels, to the direct-acting compound engine,\r\nwith surface-condenser and screw-propellers, has occurred within the\r\nmemory and under the observation of even young engineers, and it may\r\nbe considered that the revolution has not been completely effected.\r\nThis change in the design of engine is not as great as it at first\r\nseemed likely to become. Builders have but slowly learned the\r\nprinciples stated above in reference to expansion in one or more\r\ncylinders, and the earlier engines were made with a high and low\r\npressure cylinder working on the same connecting-rod, and each machine\r\nconsisted of four steam-cylinders. It was at last discovered that a\r\nhigh-pressure single-cylinder engine exhausting into a separate\r\nlarger low-pressure engine might give good results, and the compound\r\nengine became as simple as the type of engine which it displaced. This\r\nindependence of high and low pressure engines is not in itself novel,\r\nfor the plan of using the exhaust of a high-pressure engine to drive a\r\nlow-pressure condensing engine was one of the earliest of known\r\ncombinations.\r\n\r\nThe advantage of introducing double engines at sea is considerably\r\ngreater than on land. The coal carried by a steam-vessel is not only\r\nan item of great importance in consequence of its first cost, but,\r\ndisplacing its weight or bulk of freight which might otherwise be\r\ncarried, it represents so much non-paying cargo, and is to be charged\r\nwith the full cost of transportation in addition to first cost. The\r\nbest of steam-coal is therefore usually chosen for steamers making\r\nlong voyages, and the necessity of obtaining the most economical\r\nengines is at once seen, and is fully appreciated by steamship\r\nproprietors. Again, an economy of one-fourth of a pound per\r\nhorse-power per hour gives, on a large transatlantic steamer, a saving\r\nof about 100 tons of coal for a single voyage. To this saving of cost\r\nis to be added the gain in wages and sustenance of the labor required\r\nto handle that coal, and the gain by 100 tons of freight carried in\r\nplace of the coal.\r\n\r\nFor many years the change which has here been outlined, in the forms\r\nof engine and the working of steam expansively, was retarded by the\r\ninefficiency of methods and tools used in construction. With gradual\r\nimprovement in tools and in methods of doing work, it became possible\r\nto control higher steam and to work it successfully; and the change in\r\nthis direction has been steadily going on up to the present time with\r\nall types of steam-engine. At sea this rise of pressure was for a\r\nconsiderable time retarded by the serious difficulty encountered in\r\nthe tendency of the sulphate of lime to deposit in the boiler. When\r\nsteam-pressure had risen to 25 pounds per square inch, it was found\r\nthat no amount of \"blowing out\" would prevent the deposition of\r\nseriously large quantities of this salt, while at the lower pressures\r\nat first carried at sea no troublesome precipitation occurred, and the\r\nonly precaution necessary was to blow out sufficient brine to prevent\r\nthe precipitation of common salt from a supersaturated solution. The\r\nintroduction of surface-condensation was promptly attempted as the\r\nremedy for this evil, but for many years it was extremely doubtful\r\nwhether its disadvantages were not greater than its advantages. It was\r\nfound very difficult to keep the condensers tight, and boilers were\r\ninjured by some singular process of corrosion, evidently due to the\r\npresence of the surface-condenser. The simple expedient of permitting\r\na very thin scale to form in the boiler was, after a time, hit upon as\r\na means of overcoming this difficulty, and thenceforward the greatest\r\nobstacle to the general introduction was the conservative disposition\r\nfound among those who had charge of marine machinery, which\r\nconservatism regarded with suspicion every innovation. Another trouble\r\narose from the difficulty of finding men neither too indolent nor too\r\nignorant to take charge of the new condenser, which, more complicated\r\nand more readily disarranged than the old, demanded a higher class of\r\nattendants. Once introduced, however, the surface-condenser removed\r\nthe obstacle to further elevation of steam-pressure, and the rise from\r\n20 to 60 pounds pressure soon occurred. Elder and his competitors on\r\nthe Clyde were the first to take advantage of the fact when these\r\nhigher pressures became practicable.\r\n\r\nThe lightness of engine and the smaller weight of boiler secured when\r\nthe simpler type of \"compound\" engine is used are great advantages,\r\nand, when coupled with the fact that by no other satisfactory device\r\ncan great expansion and consequent economy of fuel be obtained at sea,\r\nthe advantages are such as to make the adoption of this style of\r\nengine imperative for ship-propulsion.\r\n\r\nThis extreme lightness in machinery has been largely, also, the result\r\nof very careful and skillful designing, of intelligent construction,\r\nand of care in the selection and use of material. British builders\r\nhad, until after the introduction of these later types of\r\nvessels-of-war, been distinguished rather by the weight of their\r\nmachinery than for nice calculation and proportioning of parts. Now\r\nthe engines of the heavy iron-clads are models of good proportions,\r\nexcellence in materials, and of workmanship, which are well worthy of\r\nstudy. The weight per indicated horse-power has been reduced from 400\r\nor 500 pounds to less than half that amount within the last ten years.\r\nThis has been accomplished by forcing the boilers--although thus, to\r\nsome extent, losing economy--by higher steam-pressure, a very much\r\nhigher piston-speed, reduction of friction of parts, reduction of\r\ncapacity for coal-stowage, and exceedingly careful proportioning.\r\nThe reduction of coal-bunker capacity is largely compensated by\r\nthe increase of economy secured by superheating, by increased\r\nexpansion, elevation of piston-speed, and the introduction of\r\nsurface-condensation.\r\n\r\nA good marine steam-engine of the form which was considered standard\r\n15 or 20 years ago, having low-pressure boilers carrying steam at 20\r\nor 25 pounds pressure as a maximum, expanding twice or three times,\r\nand having a jet-condenser, would require about 30 or 35 pounds of\r\nfeed-water per horse-power per hour; substituting surface-condensation\r\nfor that produced by the jet brought down the weight of steam used to\r\nfrom 25 to 30 pounds; increasing steam-pressure to 60 pounds,\r\nexpanding from five to eight times, and combining the special\r\nadvantages of the superheater and the compound engine with\r\nsurface-condensation, has reduced the consumption of steam to 20, or\r\neven, in some cases, 15 pounds of steam per horse-power per hour.\r\nMessrs. Perkins, of London, guarantee, as has already been stated, to\r\nfurnish engines capable of giving a horse-power with a consumption of\r\nbut 1-1/4 pound of coal. Mr. C. E. Emery reports the United States\r\nrevenue-steamer Hassler, designed by him, to have given an ordinary\r\nsea-going performance which is probably fully equal to anything yet\r\naccomplished. The Hassler is a small steamer, of but 151 feet in\r\nlength, 24-1/2 feet beam, and 10 feet draught. The engines have\r\nsteam-cylinders 18.1 and 28 inches diameter, respectively, and of 28\r\ninches stroke of piston, indicating 125 horse-power; with steam at 75\r\npounds pressure, and at a speed of but 7 knots, the coal consumed was\r\nbut 1.87 pound per horse-power per hour.\r\n\r\nThe committee of the British Admiralty on designs of ships-of-war have\r\nreported recently: \"The carrying-power of ships may certainly be to\r\nsome extent increased by the adoption of compound engines in her\r\nMajesty's service. Its use has recently become very general in the\r\nmercantile marine, and the weight of evidence in favor of the large\r\neconomy of fuel thereby gained is, to our minds, overwhelming and\r\nconclusive. We therefore beg earnestly to recommend that the use of\r\ncompound engines may be generally adopted in ships-of-war hereafter to\r\nbe constructed, and applied, whenever it can be done with due regard\r\nto economy and to the convenience of the service, to those already\r\nbuilt.\"\r\n\r\nThe forms of screws now employed are exceedingly diverse, but those in\r\ncommon use are not numerous. In naval vessels it is common to apply\r\nscrews of two blades, that they may be hoisted above water into a\r\n\"well\" when the vessel is under sail, or set with the two blades\r\ndirectly behind the stern-post, when their resistance to the forward\r\nmotion of the vessel will be comparatively small. In other vessels,\r\nand in the greater number of full-power naval vessels, screws of three\r\nor four blades are used.\r\n\r\nThe usual form of screw (Fig. 139) has blades of nearly equal breadth\r\nfrom the hub to the periphery, or slightly widening toward their\r\nextremities, as is seen in an exaggerated degree in Fig. 140,\r\nrepresenting the form adopted for tug-boats, where large surface near\r\nthe extremity is more generally used than in vessels of high speed\r\nrunning free. In the Griffith screw, which has been much used, the hub\r\nis globular and very large. The blades are secured to the hub by\r\nflanges, and are bolted on in such a manner that their position may be\r\nchanged slightly if desired. The blades are shaped like the section of\r\na pear, the wider part being nearest the hub, and the blades tapering\r\nrapidly toward their extremities. A usual form is intermediate between\r\nthe last, and is like that shown in Fig. 141, the hub being\r\nsufficiently enlarged to permit the blades to be attached as in the\r\nGriffith screw, but more nearly cylindrical, and the blades having\r\nnearly uniform width from end to end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 139.--Screw-Propeller.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 140.--Tug-boat Screw.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 141.--Hirsch Screw.]\r\n\r\nThe pitch of a screw is the distance which would be traversed by the\r\nscrew in one revolution were it to move through the water without\r\nslip; i. e., it is double the distance _C D_, Fig. 140. _C D'_\r\nrepresents the helical path of the extremity of the blade _B_, and _O\r\nE F H K_ is that of the blade _A_. The proportion of diameter to the\r\npitch of the screw is determined by the speed of the vessel. For low\r\nspeed the pitch may be as small as 1-1/4 the diameter. For vessels of\r\nhigh speed the pitch is frequently double the diameter. The diameter\r\nof the screw is made as great as possible, since the slip decreases\r\nwith the increase of the area of screw-disk. Its length is usually\r\nabout one-sixth of the diameter. A greater length produces loss by\r\nincrease of surface causing too great friction, while a shorter screw\r\ndoes not fully utilize the resisting power of the cylinder of water\r\nwithin which it works, and increased slip causes waste of power. An\r\nempirical value for the probable slip in vessels of good shape, which\r\nis closely approximate usually, is _S_ = 4(_M_/_A_), in which _S_ is\r\nthe slip per cent., and _M_ and _A_ are the areas of the midship\r\nsection and of the screw-disk in square feet.\r\n\r\nThe most effective screws have slightly greater pitch at the periphery\r\nthan at the hub, and an increasing pitch from the forward to the rear\r\npart of the screw. The latter method of increasing pitch is more\r\ngenerally adopted alone. The thrust of the screw is the pressure which\r\nit exerts in driving the vessel forward. In well-formed vessels, with\r\ngood screws, about two-thirds of the power applied to the screw is\r\nutilized in propulsion, the remainder being wasted in slip and other\r\nuseless work. Its efficiency is in such a case, therefore, 66 per\r\ncent. Twin screws, one on each side of the stern-post, are sometimes\r\nused in vessels of light draught and considerable breadth, whereby\r\ndecreased slip is secured.\r\n\r\nAs has already been stated, the introduction of the compound engine\r\nhas been attempted, but with less success than in Europe, by several\r\nAmerican engineers.\r\n\r\nThe most radical change in the methods of ship-propulsion which has\r\nbeen successfully introduced in some localities has been the adoption\r\nof a system of \"wire-rope towage.\" It is only well adapted for cases\r\nin which the steamer traverses the same line constantly, moving\r\nbackward and forward between certain points, and is never compelled to\r\ndeviate to any considerable extent from the path selected. A similar\r\nsystem is in use in Canada, but it has not yet come into use in the\r\nUnited States, notwithstanding the fact that, wherever its adoption is\r\npracticable, it has a marked superiority in economy over the usual\r\nmethods of propulsion. With chain or rope traction there is no loss by\r\nslip or oblique action, as in both screw and paddle-wheel propulsion.\r\nIn the latter methods these losses amount to an important fraction of\r\nthe total power; they rarely, if ever, fall below a total of 25 per\r\ncent., and probably in towage exceed 50 per cent. The objection to the\r\nadoption of chain-propulsion, as it is also often called, is the\r\nnecessity of following closely the line along which the chain or the\r\nrope is laid. There is, however, much less difficulty than would be\r\nanticipated in following a sinuous route or in avoiding obstacles in\r\nthe channel or passing other vessels. The system is particularly well\r\nadapted for use on canals.\r\n\r\nThe steam-boilers in use in the later and best marine engineering\r\npractice are of various forms, but the standard types are few in\r\nnumber. That used on river-steamers in the United States has already\r\nbeen described.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 142.--Marine Fire-tubular Boiler. Section.]\r\n\r\nFig. 142 is a type of marine tubular boiler which is in most extensive\r\nuse in sea-going steamers for moderate pressure, and particularly for\r\nnaval vessels. Here the gases pass directly into the back connection\r\nfrom the fire, and thence forward again, through horizontal tubes, to\r\nthe front connection and up the chimney. In naval vessels the\r\nsteam-chimney is omitted, as it is there necessary to keep all parts\r\nof the boiler as far below the water-line as possible. Steam is taken\r\nfrom the boiler by pipes which are carried from end to end of the\r\nsteam-space, near the top of the boiler, the steam entering these\r\npipes through small holes drilled on the other side. Steam is thus\r\ntaken from the boiler \"wet,\" but no large quantity of water can\r\nusually be \"entrained\" by the steam.\r\n\r\nA marine boiler has been quite extensively introduced into the United\r\nStates navy, in which the gases are led from the back connection\r\nthrough a tube-box around and among a set of upright water-tubes,\r\nwhich are filled with water, circulation taking place freely from the\r\nwater-space immediately above the crown-sheet of the furnace up\r\nthrough these tubes into the water-space above them. These\r\n\"water-tubular\" boilers have a slight advantage over the\r\n\"fire-tubular\" boilers already described in compactness, in steaming\r\ncapacity, and in economical efficiency. They have a very marked\r\nadvantage in the facility with which the tubes may be scraped or freed\r\nfrom the deposit when a scale of sulphate of lime or other salt has\r\nformed within them by precipitation from the water. The fire-tubular\r\nboiler excels in convenience of access for plugging up leaking tubes,\r\nand is much less costly than the water-tubular. The water-tube class\r\nof boilers still remain in extensive use in the United States naval\r\nsteamers. They have never been much used in the merchant service,\r\nalthough introduced by James Montgomery in the United States and by\r\nLord Dundonald in Great Britain twenty years earlier. Opinion still\r\nremains divided among engineers in regard to their relative value.\r\nThey are gradually reassuming prominence by their introduction in the\r\nmodified form of sectional boilers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 143.--Marine High-Pressure Boiler. Section.]\r\n\r\nMarine boilers are now usually given the form shown in section in Fig.\r\n143. This form of boiler is adopted where steam-pressures of 60\r\npounds and upward are carried, as in steam-vessels supplied with\r\ncompound engines, cylindrical forms being considered the best with\r\nhigh pressures. The large cylindrical flues, therefore, form the\r\nfurnaces as shown in the transverse sectional view. The gases rise, as\r\nshown in the longitudinal section, through the connection, and pass\r\nback to the end of the boiler through the tubes, and thence, instead\r\nof entering a steam-chimney, they are conducted by a smoke-connection,\r\nnot shown in the sketch, to the smoke funnel or stack. In\r\nmerchant-steamers, a steam-drum is often mounted horizontally above\r\nthe boiler. In other cases a separator is attached to the steam-pipe\r\nbetween boilers and engines. This usually consists of an iron tank,\r\ndivided by a vertical partition extending from the top nearly to the\r\nbottom. The steam, entering the top at one side of this partition,\r\npasses underneath it, and up to the top on the opposite side, where it\r\nissues into a steam-pipe leading directly to the engine. The sudden\r\nreversal of its course at the bottom causes it to leave the suspended\r\nwater in the bottom of the separator, whence it is drained off by\r\npipes.\r\n\r\nThe most interesting illustrations of recent practice in marine\r\nengineering and naval architecture are found in the steamers which are\r\nnow seen on transoceanic routes for the merchant service, and, in the\r\nnaval service, in the enormous iron-clads which have been built in\r\nGreat Britain.\r\n\r\nThe City of Peking is one of the finest examples of American practice.\r\nThis vessel was constructed for the Pacific Mail Company. The hull is\r\n423 feet long, of 48 feet beam, and 38-1/2 feet deep. Accommodations\r\nare furnished for 150 cabin and 1,800 steerage passengers, and the\r\ncoal-bunkers \"stow\" 1,500 tons of coal. The iron plates of which the\r\nsides and bottom are made are from 11/16 to one inch in thickness. The\r\nweight of iron used in construction was about 5,500,000 pounds. The\r\nmachinery weighed nearly 2,000,000 pounds, with spare gear and\r\naccessory apparatus. The engines are compound, with two\r\nsteam-cylinders of 51 inches and two of 88 inches diameter, and a\r\nstroke of piston of 4-1/2 feet. The condensing water is sent through\r\nthe surface-condensers by circulating-pumps driven by their own\r\nengines. Ten boilers furnish steam to these engines, each having a\r\ndiameter of 13 feet, a length of 13-1/2 feet, and a thickness of\r\n\"shell\" of 13/16 inch. Each has three furnaces, and contains 204\r\ntubes of an outside diameter of 3-1/4 inches. All together, they\r\nhave 520 square feet of grate-surface and 17,000 square feet of\r\nheating-surface. The area of cooling-surface in the condensers is\r\n10,000 square feet. The City of Rome, a ship of later design, is 590\r\nfeet long, \"over all,\" 52 feet beam, 52 feet deep, and measures 8,300\r\ntons. The engines, of 8,500 horse-power, will drive the vessel 18\r\nknots (21 miles) an hour; they have six steam-cylinders (three high\r\nand three low pressure), and are supplied with steam by 8 boilers\r\nheated by 48 furnaces. The hull is of steel, the bottom double, and\r\nthe whole divided into ten compartments by transverse bulkheads. Two\r\nlongitudinal bulkheads in the engine and boiler compartments add\r\ngreatly to the safety of the vessel.\r\n\r\nThe most successful steam-vessels in general use are these\r\nscrew-steamers of transoceanic lines. Those of the transatlantic lines\r\nare now built from 350 to 550 feet long, generally propelled from 12\r\nto 18 knots (14 to 21 miles) an hour, by engines of from 3,000 to\r\n8,000 horse-power, consuming from 70 to 250 tons of coal a day, and\r\ncrossing the Atlantic in from eight to ten days. These vessels are now\r\ninvariably fitted with the compound engine and surface-condensers. One\r\nof these vessels, the Germanic, has been reported at Sandy Hook, the\r\nentrance to New York Harbor, in 7 days 11 hours 37 minutes from\r\nQueenstown--a distance, as measured by the log and by observation, of\r\n2,830 miles. Another steamer, the Britannic, has crossed the Atlantic\r\nin 7 days 10 hours and 53 minutes. These vessels are of 5,000 tons\r\nburden, of 750 \"nominal\" horse-power (probably 5,000 actual).\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 144.--The Modern Steamship.]\r\n\r\nThe modern steamship is as wonderful an illustration of ingenuity and\r\nskill in all interior arrangements as in size, power, and speed. The\r\nsize of sea-going steamers has become so great that it is unsafe to\r\nintrust the raising of the anchor or the steering of the vessel to\r\nmanual power and skill; and these operations, as well as the loading\r\nand unloading of the vessel, are now the work of the same great\r\nmotor--steam.\r\n\r\nThe now common form of auxiliary engine for controlling the helm is\r\none of the inventions of the American engineer F. E. Sickels, who\r\ndevised the \"Sickels cut-off,\" and was first invented about 1850. It\r\nwas exhibited at London at the International Exhibition of 1851. It\r\nconsists[98] principally of two cylinders working at right angles upon\r\na shaft geared into a large wheel fastened by a friction-plate lined\r\nwith wood, and set by a screw to any desired pressure on the\r\nsteering-apparatus. The wheel turned by the steersman is connected\r\nwith the valve-gear of the cylinders, so that the steam, or other\r\nmotor, will move the rudder precisely as the helmsman moves the wheel\r\nadjusting the steam-valves. This wheel thus becomes the\r\nsteering-wheel. The apparatus is usually so arranged that it may be\r\nconnected or disconnected in an instant, and hand-steering adopted if\r\nthe smoothness of the sea and the low speed of the vessel make it\r\ndesirable or convenient. This method was first adopted in the United\r\nStates on the steamship Augusta.\r\n\r\n  [98] \"Official Catalogue,\" 1862, vol. iv., Class viii., p. 123.\r\n\r\nThe same inventor and others have contrived \"steam-windlasses,\" some\r\nof which are in general use on large vessels. The machinery of these\r\nvessels is also often fitted with a steam \"reversing-gear,\" by means\r\nof which the engines are as easily man[oe]uvred as are those of the\r\nsmallest vessels, to which hand-gear is always fitted. In one of these\r\nlittle auxiliary engines, as devised by the author, a small handle\r\nbeing adjusted to a marked position, as to the point marked \"stop\" on\r\nan index-plate, the auxiliary engine at once starts, throws the\r\nvalve-gear into the proper position--as, if a link-motion, into\r\n\"middle-gear\"--thus stopping the large engines, and then it itself\r\nstops. Setting the handle so that its pointer shall point to \"ahead,\"\r\nthe little engine starts again, sets the link in position to go ahead,\r\nthus starting the large engines, and again stops itself. If set at\r\n\"back,\" the same series of operations occurs, leaving the main engines\r\nbacking and the little \"reversing engine\" stopped. A number of forms\r\nof reversing engine are in use, each adapted to some one type of\r\nengine.\r\n\r\nThe hull of the transatlantic steamer is now always of iron, and is\r\ndivided into a number of \"compartments,\" each of which is water-tight\r\nand separated from the adjacent compartments by iron \"bulkheads,\" in\r\nwhich are fitted doors which, when closed, are also water-tight. In\r\nsome cases these doors close automatically when the water rises in the\r\nvessel, thus confining it to the leaking portion.\r\n\r\nThus we have already seen a change in transoceanic lines from steamers\r\nlike the Great Western (1837), 212 feet in length, of 35-1/2 feet\r\nbeam, and 23 feet depth, driven by engines of 450 horse-power, and\r\nrequiring 15 days to cross the Atlantic, to steamships over 550 feet\r\nlong, 55 feet beam, and 55 feet deep, with engines of 10,000\r\nhorse-power, crossing the Atlantic in 7 days; iron substituted for\r\nwood in construction, the cost of fuel reduced one-half, and the speed\r\nraised from 8 to 18 knots and over. In the earlier days of steamships\r\nthey were given a proportion of length to breadth of from 5 to 6 to 1;\r\nin forty years the proportion increased until 11 to 1 was reached.\r\n\r\nThe whole naval establishment of every country has been greatly\r\nmodified by the recent changes in methods of attack and defense; but\r\nthe several classes of ships which still form the naval marine are all\r\nas dependent upon their steam-machinery as ever.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: H. B. M. Iron-Clad Captain. H. B. M. Iron-Clad\r\nThunderer. U. S. Iron-Clad Dictator. U. S. Iron-Clad Monitor. H. B. M.\r\nIron-Clad Giatton. French Iron-Clad Dunderberg. FIG. 145.--Modern\r\nIron-Clads.]\r\n\r\nIt is only recently that the attempt seems to have been made to\r\ndetermine a classification of war-vessels and to plan a naval\r\nestablishment which shall be likely to meet fully the requirements of\r\nthe immediate future. It has hitherto been customary simply to make\r\neach ship a little stronger, faster, or more powerful to resist or to\r\nmake attack than was the last. The fact that the direction of\r\nprogress in naval science and architecture is plainly perceivable, and\r\nthat upon its study may be based a fair estimate of the character and\r\nrelative distribution of several classes of vessels, seems to have\r\nbeen appreciated by very few.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1870 the writer proposed[99] a classification of vessels\r\nother than torpedo-vessels, which has since been also proposed in a\r\nsomewhat modified form by Mr. J. Scott Russell.[100] The author then\r\nremarked that the increase so rapidly occurring in weight of ordnance\r\nand of armor, and in speed of war-vessels, would probably soon compel\r\na division of the vessels of every navy into three classes of ships,\r\nexclusive of torpedo-vessels, one for general service in time of\r\npeace, the others for use only in time of war.\r\n\r\n  [99] _Journal Franklin Institute_, 1870. H. B. M. S. Monarch.\r\n\r\n  [100] London _Engineering_, 1875.\r\n\r\n\"The first class may consist of unarmored vessels of moderate size,\r\nfair speed under steam, armed with a few tolerably heavy guns, and\r\ncarrying full sail-power.\r\n\r\n\"The second class may be vessels of great speed under steam,\r\nunarmored, carrying light batteries and as great spread of canvas as\r\ncan readily be given them; very much such vessels as the Wampanoag\r\nclass of our own navy were intended to be--calculated expressly to\r\ndestroy the commerce of an enemy.\r\n\r\n\"The third class may consist of ships carrying the heaviest possible\r\narmor and armament, with strongly-built bows, the most powerful\r\nmachinery that can be given them, of large coal-carrying capacity, and\r\nunencumbered by sails, everything being made secondary to the one\r\nobject of obtaining victory in contending with the most powerful of\r\npossible opponents. Such vessels could never go to sea singly, but\r\nwould cruise in couples or in squadrons. It seems hardly doubtful that\r\nattempts to combine the qualities of all classes in a single vessel,\r\nas has hitherto been done, will be necessarily given up, although the\r\nclassification indicated will certainly tend largely to restrict naval\r\noperations.\"\r\n\r\nThe introduction of the stationary, the floating, and the automatic\r\nclasses of torpedoes, and of torpedo-vessels, has now become\r\naccomplished, and this element, which it was predicted by Bushnell and\r\nby Fulton three-quarters of a century ago would at some future time\r\nbecome important in warfare, is now well recognized by all nations.\r\nHow far it may modify future naval establishments cannot be yet\r\nconfidently stated, but it seems sufficiently evident that the attack,\r\nby any navy, of stationary defenses protected by torpedoes is now\r\nquite a thing of the past. It may be perhaps looked upon as\r\nexceedingly probable that torpedo-ships of very high speed will yet\r\ndrive all heavily-armored vessels from the ocean, thus completing the\r\nhistoric parallel between the man-in-armor of the middle ages and the\r\narmored man-of-war of our own time.[101]\r\n\r\n  [101] _Vide_ \"Report on Machinery and Manufactures, etc., at\r\n  Vienna,\" by the author, Washington, 1875.\r\n\r\nOf these classes, the third is of most interest, as exhibiting most\r\nperfectly the importance and variety of the work which the\r\nsteam-engine is made to perform. On the later of these vessels, the\r\nanchor is raised by a steam anchor-hoisting apparatus; the heavier\r\nspars and sails are handled by the aid of a steam-windlass; the helm\r\nis controlled by a steering-engine, and the helmsman, with his little\r\nfinger, sets in motion a steam-engine, which adjusts the rudder with a\r\npower which is unimpeded by wind or sea, and with an exactness that\r\ncould not be exceeded by the hand-steering gear of a yacht; the guns\r\nare loaded by steam, are elevated or depressed, and are given lateral\r\ntraining, by the same power; the turrets in which the guns are incased\r\nare turned, and the guns are whirled toward every point of the\r\ncompass, in less time than is required to sponge and reload them; and\r\nthe ship itself is driven through the water by the power of ten\r\nthousand horses, at a speed which is only excelled on land by that of\r\nthe railroad-train.\r\n\r\nThe British Minotaur was one of the earlier iron-clads. The great\r\nlength and consequent difficulty of man[oe]uvring, the defect of\r\nspeed, and the weakness of armor of these vessels have led to the\r\nsubstitution of far more effective designs in later constructions. The\r\nMinotaur is a four-masted screw iron-clad, 400 feet long, of 59 feet\r\nbeam and 26-1/2 feet draught of water. Her speed at sea is about\r\n12-1/2 knots, and her engines develop, as a maximum, nearly 6,000\r\nindicated horse-power. Her heaviest armor-plates are but 6 inches in\r\nthickness. Her extreme length and her unbalanced rudder make it\r\ndifficult to turn rapidly. With _eighteen men at the steering-wheel_\r\nand sixty others on the tackle, the ship, on one occasion, was 7-1/2\r\nminutes in turning completely around. These long iron-clads were\r\nsucceeded by the shorter vessels designed by Mr. E. J. Reed, of which\r\nthe first, the Bellerophon, was of 4,246 tons burden, 300 feet long by\r\n56 feet beam, and 24-1/2 feet draught, of the 14-knot speed, with\r\n4,600 horse-power; and having the \"balanced rudder\" used many years\r\nearlier in the United States by Robert L. Stevens,[102] it can turn in\r\nfour minutes with eight men at the wheel. The cost of construction was\r\nsome $600,000 less than that of the Minotaur. A still later vessel,\r\nthe Monarch, was constructed on a system quite similar to that known\r\nin the United States as the Monitor type, or as a turreted iron-clad.\r\nThis vessel is 330 feet long, 57-1/2 feet wide, and 36 feet deep,\r\ndrawing 24-1/2 feet of water. The total weight of ship and contents is\r\nover 8,000 tons, and the engines are of over 8,500 horse-power. The\r\narmor is 6 and 7 inches thick on the hull, and 8 inches on the two\r\nturrets, over a heavy teak backing. The turrets contain each two\r\n12-inch rifled guns, weighing 25 tons each, and, with a charge of 70\r\npounds of powder, throwing a shot of 600 pounds weight with a velocity\r\nof 1,200 feet per second, and giving it a _vis viva_ equivalent to the\r\nraising of over 6,100 tons one foot high, and equal to the work of\r\npenetrating an iron plate 13-1/2 inches thick. This immense vessel is\r\ndriven by a pair of \"single-cylinder\" engines having steam-cylinders\r\n_ten feet_ in diameter and of 4-1/2 feet stroke of piston, driving a\r\ntwo-bladed Griffith screw of 23-1/2 feet diameter and 26-1/2 feet\r\npitch, 65 revolutions, at the maximum speed of 14.9 knots, or about\r\n17-1/2 miles, an hour. To drive these powerful engines, boilers having\r\nan aggregate of about 25,000 square feet (or more than a half-acre) of\r\nheating-surface are required, with 900 square feet of grate-surface.\r\nThe refrigerating surface in the condensers has an area of 16,500\r\nsquare feet--over one-third of an acre. The cost of these engines and\r\nboilers was L66,500.\r\n\r\n  [102] Still in use on the Hoboken ferry-boats.\r\n\r\nWere all this vast steam-power developed, giving the vessel a speed of\r\n15 knots, the ship, if used as a \"ram,\" would strike an enemy at rest\r\nwith the tremendous \"energy\" of 48,000 foot-tons--equal to the shock\r\nof the projectiles of eight or nine such guns as are carried by the\r\niron-clad itself, simultaneously discharged upon one spot.\r\n\r\nBut even this great vessel is less formidable than later vessels. One\r\nof the latter, the Inflexible, is a shorter but wider and deeper ship\r\nthan the Monarch, measuring 320 feet long, 75 feet beam, and 25\r\ndraught, displacing over 10,000 tons. The great rifles carried by this\r\nvessel weigh 81 tons each, throwing shot weighing a half-ton from\r\nbehind iron-plating two feet in thickness. The steam-engines are of\r\nabout the same power as those of the Monarch, and give this enormous\r\nhull a speed of 14 knots an hour.\r\n\r\nThe navy of the United States does not to-day possess iron-clads of\r\npower even approximating that of either of several classes of British\r\nand other foreign naval vessels.\r\n\r\nThe largest vessel of any class yet constructed is the Great Eastern\r\n(Fig. 146), begun in 1854 and completed in 1859, by J. Scott Russell,\r\non the Thames, England. This ship is 680 feet long, 83 feet wide, 58\r\nfeet deep, 28 feet draught, and of 24,000 tons measurement. There are\r\nfour paddle and four screw engines, the former having steam-cylinders\r\n74 inches in diameter, with 14 feet stroke, the latter 84 inches in\r\ndiameter and 4 feet stroke. They are collectively of 10,000 actual\r\nhorse-power. The paddle-wheels are 56 feet in diameter, the screw 24\r\nfeet. The steam-boilers supplying the paddle-engines have 44,000\r\nsquare feet (more than an acre) of heating-surface. The boilers\r\nsupplying the screw-engines are still larger. At 30 feet draught, this\r\ngreat vessel displaces 27,000 tons. The engines were designed to\r\ndevelop 10,000 horse-power, driving the ship at the rate of 16-1/2\r\nstatute miles an hour.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 146.--The Great Eastern.]\r\n\r\nThe figures quoted in the descriptions of these great steamships do\r\nnot enable the non-professional reader to form a conception of the\r\nwonderful power which is concentrated within so small a space as is\r\noccupied by their steam-machinery. The \"horse-power\" of the engines is\r\nthat determined by James Watt as the maximum obtainable for eight\r\nhours a day from the strongest London draught-horses. The ordinary\r\naverage draught-horse would hardly be able to exert two-thirds as much\r\nduring the eight hours' steady work of a working-day. The working-day\r\nof the steam-engine, on the other hand, is twenty-four hours in\r\nlength.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FIG. 147.--The Great Eastern at Sea.]\r\n\r\nThe work of the 10,000 horse-power engines of the Great Eastern could\r\nbe barely equaled by the efforts of 15,000 horses; but to continue\r\ntheir work uninterruptedly, day in and day out, for weeks together, as\r\nwhen done by steam, would require at least three relays, or 45,000\r\nhorses. Such a stud would weigh 25,000 tons, and if harnessed \"tandem\"\r\nwould extend thirty miles. It is only by such a comparison that the\r\nmind can begin to comprehend the utter impossibility of accomplishing\r\nby means of animal power the work now done for the world by steam.\r\nThe cost of the greater power is but about one-tenth that of\r\nhorse-power, and by its means tasks are accomplished with ease which\r\nare absolutely impossible of accomplishment by animal power.\r\n\r\nIt is estimated that the total steam-power of the world is about\r\n15,000,000 horse-power, and that, were horses actually employed to do\r\nthe work which these engines would be capable of doing were they kept\r\nconstantly in operation, the number required would exceed 60,000,000.\r\n\r\nThus, from the small beginnings of the Comte d'Auxiron and the Marquis\r\nde Jouffroy in France, of Symmington in Great Britain, and of Henry,\r\nRumsey, and Fitch, and of Fulton and Stevens, in the United States,\r\nsteam-navigation has grown into a great and inestimable aid and\r\nblessing to mankind.\r\n\r\nWe to-day cross the ocean with less risk, and transport ourselves and\r\nour goods at as little cost in either time or money as, at the\r\nbeginning of the century, our parents experienced in traveling\r\none-tenth the distance.\r\n\r\nIt is largely in consequence of this ingenious application of a power\r\nthat reminds one of the fabled genii of Eastern romance, that the\r\nmechanic and the laborer of to-day enjoy comforts and luxuries that\r\nwere denied to wealth, and to royalty itself, a century ago.\r\n\r\nThe magnitude of our modern steamships excites the wonder and\r\nadmiration of even the people of our own time; and there is certainly\r\nno creation of art that can be grander in appearance than a\r\ntransatlantic steamer a hundred and fifty yards in length, and\r\nweighing, with her stores, five or six thousand tons, as she starts on\r\nher voyage, moved by engines equal in power to the united strength of\r\nthousands of horses; none can more fully awaken a feeling of awe than\r\nan immense structure like the great modern iron-clads (Fig. 145),\r\nvessels having a total weight of 8,000 to 10,000 tons, and propelled\r\nby steam-engines of as many horse-power, carrying guns whose shot\r\npenetrate solid iron 20 inches thick, and having a power of impact,\r\nwhen steaming at moderate speed, sufficient to raise 35,000 tons a\r\nfoot high.\r\n\r\nFar more huge than the Monarch among the iron-clads even is that\r\nprematurely-built monster, the Great Eastern (Fig. 147), already\r\ndescribed, an eighth of a mile long, and with steam doing the work of\r\na stud of 45,000 horses.\r\n\r\nThus we are to-day witnessing the literal fulfillment of the\r\npredictions of Oliver Evans and of John Stevens, and almost that\r\ncontained in the couplets written by the poet Darwin, who, more than a\r\ncentury ago, before even the earliest of Watt's improvements had\r\nbecome generally known, sang:\r\n\r\n    \"Soon shall thy arm, unconquered Steam, afar\r\n    Drag the slow barge, or drive the rapid car;\r\n    Or, on wide-waving wings expanded, bear\r\n    The flying chariot through the fields of air.\"\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VII.\r\n\r\n_THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE STEAM-ENGINE._\r\n\r\nTHE HISTORY OF ITS GROWTH; ENERGETICS AND THERMO-DYNAMICS.\r\n\r\n  \"Of all the features which characterize this progressive economical\r\n  movement of civilized nations, that which first excites attention,\r\n  through its intimate connection with the phenomena of production, is\r\n  the perpetual and, so far as human foresight can extend, the\r\n  unlimited growth of man's power over Nature. Our knowledge of the\r\n  properties and laws of physical objects shows no sign of approaching\r\n  its ultimate boundaries; it is advancing more rapidly, and in a\r\n  greater number of directions at once, than in any previous age or\r\n  generation, and affording such frequent glimpses of unexplored\r\n  fields beyond as to justify the belief that our acquaintance with\r\n  Nature is still almost in its infancy.\"--MILL.\r\n\r\n\r\nThe growth of the philosophy of the steam-engine presents as\r\ninteresting a study as that of the successive changes which have\r\noccurred in its mechanism.\r\n\r\nIn the operation of the steam-engine we find illustrated many of the\r\nmost important principles and facts which constitute the physical\r\nsciences. The steam-engine is an exceedingly ingenious, but,\r\nunfortunately, still very imperfect, machine for transforming the\r\nheat-energy obtained by the chemical combination of a combustible with\r\nthe supporter of combustion into mechanical energy. But the original\r\nsource of all this energy is found far back of its first appearance in\r\nthe steam-boiler. It had its origin at the beginning, when all Nature\r\ncame into existence. After the solar system had been formed from the\r\nnebulous chaos of creation, the glowing mass which is now called the\r\nsun was the depository of a vast store of heat-energy, which was\r\nthence radiated into space and showered upon the attendant worlds in\r\ninconceivable quantity and with unmeasured intensity. During the past\r\nlife of the globe, the heat-energy received from the sun upon the\r\nearth's surface was partly expended in the production of great\r\nforests, and the storage, in the trunks, branches, and leaves of the\r\ntrees of which they were composed, of an immense quantity of carbon,\r\nwhich had previously existed in the atmosphere, combined with oxygen,\r\nas carbonic acid. The great geological changes which buried these\r\nforests under superincumbent strata of rock and earth resulted in the\r\nformation of coal-beds, and the storage, during many succeeding ages,\r\nof a vast amount of carbon, of which the affinity for oxygen remained\r\nunsatisfied until finally uncovered by the hand of man. Thus we owe to\r\nthe heat and light of the sun, as was pointed out by George\r\nStephenson, the incalculable store of potential energy upon which the\r\nhuman race is so dependent for life and all its necessaries, comforts,\r\nand luxuries.\r\n\r\nThis coal, thrown upon the grate in the steam-boiler, takes fire, and,\r\nuniting again with the oxygen, sets free heat in precisely the same\r\nquantity that it was received from the sun and appropriated during the\r\ngrowth of the tree. The actual energy thus rendered available is\r\ntransferred, by conduction and radiation, to the water in the\r\nsteam-boiler, converts it into steam, and its mechanical effect is\r\nseen in the expansion of the liquid into vapor against the\r\nsuperincumbent pressure. Transferred from the boiler to the engine,\r\nthe steam is there permitted to expand, doing work, and the\r\nheat-energy with which it is charged becomes partly converted into\r\nmechanical energy, and is applied to useful work in the mill or to\r\ndriving the locomotive or the steamboat.\r\n\r\nThus we may trace the store of energy received from the sun and\r\ncontained in our coal through its several changes until it is finally\r\nset at work; and we might go still further and observe how, in each\r\ncase, it is again usually re-transformed and again set free as\r\nheat-energy.\r\n\r\nThe transformation which takes place in the furnace is a chemical\r\nchange; the transfer of heat to the water and the subsequent phenomena\r\naccompanying its passage through the engine are physical changes, some\r\nof which require for their investigation abstruse mathematical\r\noperations. A thorough comprehension of the principles governing the\r\noperation of the steam-engine, therefore, can only be attained after\r\nstudying the phenomena of physical science with sufficient minuteness\r\nand accuracy to be able to express with precision the laws of which\r\nthose sciences are constituted. The study of the philosophy of the\r\nsteam-engine involves the study of chemistry and physics, and of the\r\nnew science of energetics, of which the now well-grown science of\r\nthermo-dynamics is a branch. This sketch of the growth of the\r\nsteam-engine may, therefore, be very properly concluded by an outline\r\nof the growth of the several sciences which together make up its\r\nphilosophy, and especially of the science of thermo-dynamics, which is\r\npeculiarly the science of the steam-engine and of the other\r\nheat-engines.\r\n\r\nThese sciences, like the steam-engine itself, have an origin which\r\nantedates the commencement of the Christian era; but they grew with an\r\nalmost imperceptible growth for many centuries, and finally, only a\r\ncentury ago, started onward suddenly and rapidly, and their progress\r\nhas never since been checked. They are now fully-developed and\r\nwell-established systems of natural philosophy. Yet, like that of the\r\nsteam-engine and of its companion heat-engines, their growth has by no\r\nmeans ceased; and, while the student of science cannot do more than\r\nindicate the direction of their progress, he can readily believe that\r\nthe beginning of the end is not yet reached in their movement toward\r\ncompleteness, either in the determination of facts or in the\r\ncodification of their laws.\r\n\r\nWhen Hero lived at Alexandria, the great \"Museum\" was a most important\r\ncentre, about which gathered the teachers of all then known\r\nphilosophies and of all the then recognized but unformed sciences, as\r\nwell as of all those technical branches of study which had already\r\nbeen so far developed as to be capable of being systematically taught.\r\nAstronomical observations had been made regularly and uninterruptedly\r\nby the Chaldean astrologers for two thousand years, and records\r\nextending back many centuries had been secured at Babylon by\r\nCalisthenes and given to Aristotle, the father of our modern\r\nscientific method. Ptolemy had found ready to his hand the records of\r\nChaldean observers of eclipses extending back nearly 650 years, and\r\nmarvelously accurate.[103]\r\n\r\n  [103] Their estimate of the length of the Saros, or cycle of\r\n  eclipses--over 19 years--was \"within 19-1/2 minutes of the\r\n  truth.\"--DRAPER.\r\n\r\nA rude method of printing with an engraved roller on plastic clay,\r\nafterward baked, thus making up ceramic libraries, was practised long\r\nprevious to this time; and in the alcoves in which Hero worked were\r\nmany of these books of clay.\r\n\r\nThis great Library and Museum of Alexandria was founded three\r\ncenturies before the birth of Christ, by Ptolemy Soter, who\r\nestablished as his capital that great Egyptian city when the death of\r\nhis brother, the youthful but famous conqueror whose name he gave it,\r\nplaced him upon the throne of the colossal successor of the then\r\nfallen Persian Empire. The city itself, embellished with every\r\nornament and provided with every luxury that the wealth of a conquered\r\nworld or the skill, taste, and ingenuity of the Greek painters,\r\nsculptors, architects, and engineers could provide, was full of\r\nwonders; it was a wonder in itself. This rich, populous, and\r\nmagnificent city was the metropolis of the then civilized world.\r\nTrade, commerce, manufactures, and the fine arts were all represented\r\nin this splendid exchange, and learning found its most acceptable\r\nhome and noblest field within the walls of Ptolemy's Museum; its\r\ndisciples found themselves welcomed and protected by its founder and\r\nhis successors, Philadelphus and the later Ptolemies.\r\n\r\nThe Alexandrian Museum was founded with the declared object of\r\ncollecting all written works of authority, of promoting the study of\r\nliterature and art, and of stimulating and assisting experimental and\r\nmathematical scientific investigation and research. The founders of\r\nmodern libraries, colleges, and technical schools have their prototype\r\nin intelligence, public spirit, and liberality, in the first of the\r\nPtolemies, who not only spent an immense sum in establishing this\r\ngreat institution, but spared no expense in sustaining it. Agents were\r\nsent out into all parts of the world, purchasing books. A large staff\r\nof scribes was maintained at the museum, whose duty it was to multiply\r\ncopies of valuable works, and to copy for the library such works as\r\ncould not be purchased.\r\n\r\nThe faculty of the museum was as carefully organized as was the plan\r\nof its administration. The four principal faculties of astronomy,\r\nliterature, mathematics, and medicine were subdivided into sections\r\ndevoted to the several branches of each department. The collections of\r\nthe museum were as complete as the teachers of the undeveloped\r\nsciences of the time could make them. Lectures were given in all\r\nbranches of study, and the number of students was sometimes as great\r\nas twelve or thirteen thousand. The number of books which were\r\ncollected here, when the barbarian leaders of the Roman troops under\r\nCaesar burned the greater part of it, was stated to be 700,000. Of\r\nthese, 400,000 were within the museum itself, and were all destroyed;\r\nthe rest were in the temple of Serapis, and, for the time, escaped\r\ndestruction.\r\n\r\nThe greatest of all the great men who lived at Alexandria at the time\r\nof the establishment of the museum was Aristotle, the teacher of\r\nAlexander and the friend of Ptolemy. It is to Aristotle that we owe\r\nthe systematization of the philosophical ideas of Plato and the\r\ncreation of the inductive method, in which has originated all modern\r\nscience. It is to the learned men of Alexandria that we are indebted\r\nfor so effective an application of the Aristotelian philosophy that\r\nall the then known sciences were given form, and were so thoroughly\r\nestablished that the work of modern science has been purely one of\r\ndevelopment.\r\n\r\nThe inductive method, which built up all the older sciences, and which\r\nhas created all those of recent development, consists, first, in the\r\ndiscovery and quantitative determination of facts; secondly, when a\r\nsufficient number of facts have been thus observed and defined, in the\r\ngrouping of those facts, and the detection, by a study of their mutual\r\nrelations, of the natural laws which give rise to or regulate them.\r\nThis simple method is that--and the only--method by which science\r\nadvances. By this method, and by it only, do we acquire connected and\r\nsystematic knowledge of all the phenomena of Nature of which the\r\nphysical sciences are cognizant. It is only by the application of this\r\nAristotelian method and philosophy that we can hope to acquire exact\r\nscientific knowledge of existing phenomena, or to become able to\r\nanticipate the phenomena which are to distinguish the future. The\r\nAristotelian method of observing facts, and of inductive reasoning\r\nwith those facts as a basis, has taught the chemist the properties of\r\nthe known elementary substances and their characteristic behavior\r\nunder ascertained conditions, and has taught him the laws of\r\ncombination and the effects of their union, enabling him to predict\r\nthe changes and the phenomena, chemical and physical, which inevitably\r\nfollow their contact under any specified set of conditions.\r\n\r\nIt is this process which has enabled the physicist to ascertain the\r\nmethods of molecular motion which give us light, heat, or electricity,\r\nand the range of action and the laws which govern the transfer of\r\nenergy from one of these modes of motion to another. It was this\r\nmethod of study which enabled James Watt to detect and to remedy the\r\ndefects of the Newcomen engine, and it is by the Aristotelian\r\nphilosophy that the engineer of to-day is taught to construct the\r\nmodern steamship, and to predict, before the keel is laid or a blow\r\nstruck in the workshop or the ship-yard, what will be the weight of\r\nthe vessel, its cargo-carrying capacity, the necessary size and power\r\nof its engines, the quantity of coal which they will require per day\r\nwhile crossing the ocean, the depth at which the great hull will float\r\nin the water, and the exact speed that the vessel will attain when the\r\nengines are exerting their thousand or their ten thousand horse-power.\r\n\r\nIt was at Alexandria that this mighty philosophy was first given a\r\nfield in which to work effectively. Here Ptolemy studied astronomy and\r\n\"natural philosophy;\" Archimedes applied himself to the studies which\r\nattract the mathematician and engineer; Euclid taught his royal pupil\r\nthose elements of geometry which have remained standard twenty-two\r\ncenturies; Eratosthenes and Hipparchus studied and taught astronomy,\r\nand inaugurated the existing system of quantitative investigation,\r\nproving the spherical form of the earth; and Ctesibius and Hero\r\nstudied pneumatics and experimented with the germs of the steam-engine\r\nand of less important machines.\r\n\r\nWhen, seven centuries later, the destruction of this splendid\r\ninstitution was signalized by the death of that brilliant scholar and\r\nheathen teacher of philosophy, Hypatia, at the hands of the more\r\nheathenish fanatics who tore her in pieces at the foot of the cross,\r\nand by the dispersion of the library left by Caesar's soldiers in the\r\nSerapeum, a true philosophy had been created, and the inductive method\r\nwas destined to live and to overcome every obstacle in the path of\r\nenlightenment and civilization. The fall of the Alexandrian Museum,\r\nsad as was the event, could not destroy the new philosophical method.\r\nIts fruits ripened slowly but surely, and we are to-day gathering a\r\nplentiful harvest.\r\n\r\nScience, literature, and the arts, all remained dormant for several\r\ncenturies after the catastrophe which deprived them of the light in\r\nwhich they had flourished so many centuries. The armies of the caliphs\r\nmade complete the shameful work of destruction begun by the armies of\r\nCaesar, and the Alexandrian Library, partly destroyed by the Romans,\r\nwas completely dispersed by the Patriarchs and their ignorant and\r\nfanatical followers; and finally all the scattered remnants were\r\nburned by the Saracens. But when the thirst for conquest had become\r\nsatiated or appeased, the followers of the caliphs turned their\r\nattention to intellectual pursuits, and the ninth century of the\r\nChristian era saw once more such a collection of philosophical\r\nwritings, collected at Bagdad, as could only be gathered by the power\r\nand wealth of the later conquerors of the world. Philosophy once again\r\nresumed its empire, and another race commenced the study of the\r\nmathematics of India and of Greece, the astronomy of Chaldea, and of\r\nall the sciences which originated in Greece and in Egypt. By the\r\nconquest of Spain by the Saracens, the new civilization was imported\r\ninto Western Europe and libraries were gathered together under the\r\nMoorish rulers, one of which numbered more than a half-million\r\nvolumes. Wherever Saracen armies had extended Mohammedan rule,\r\nschools and colleges, libraries and collections of philosophical\r\napparatus, were scattered in strange profusion; and students,\r\nteachers, philosophers, of all--the speculative as well as the\r\nAristotelian--schools, gathered together at these intellectual\r\nganglia, as enthusiastic in their work as were their Alexandrian\r\npredecessors. The endowment of colleges, that truest gauge of the\r\nintelligence of the wealthy classes of any community, became as\r\ncommon--perhaps more so--as at the present time, and provision was\r\nmade for the education of rich and poor alike. The mathematical\r\nsciences, and the wonderful and beautiful phenomena which--but a\r\nthousand years later--were afterward grouped into a science and called\r\nchemistry, were especially attractive to the Arabian scholars, and\r\ntechnical applications of discovered facts and laws assisted in a\r\nwonderfully rapid development of arts and manufactures.\r\n\r\nWhen, a thousand years after Christ, the centre of intellectual\r\nactivity and of material civilization had drifted westward into\r\nAndalusia, the foundation of every modern physical science except that\r\nnow just taking shape--the all-grasping science of energetics--had\r\nbeen laid with experimentally derived facts; and in mathematics there\r\nhad been erected a symmetrical and elegant superstructure. Even that\r\nunderlying principle of all the sciences, the principle of the\r\npersistence of energy, had been, perhaps unwittingly, enunciated.\r\n\r\nDistinguished historians have shown how the progress of civilization\r\nin Europe resulted in the creation, during the middle ages, of the now\r\ngreat middle class, which, holding the control of political power,\r\ngoverns every civilized nation, and has come into power so gradually\r\nthat it was only after centuries that its influence was seen and felt.\r\nThis, which Buckle[104] calls the intellectual class, first became\r\nactive, independently of the military and of the clergy, in the\r\nfourteenth century. In the two succeeding centuries this class gained\r\npower and influence; and in the seventeenth century we find a\r\nmagnificent advance in all branches of science, literature, and art,\r\nmarking the complete emancipation of the intellect from the artificial\r\nconditions which had so long repressed its every effort at\r\nadvancement.\r\n\r\n  [104] \"History of Civilization in England,\" vol. i., p. 208. London,\r\n  1868.\r\n\r\nAnother great social revolution thus occurred, following another\r\nperiod of centuries of intellectual stagnation. The Saracen invaders\r\nwere driven from Europe; the Crusaders invaded Palestine, in the vain\r\neffort to recover from the hands of the infidels the Holy Sepulchre\r\nand the Holy Land; and intestine broils and inter-state conflicts, as\r\nwell as these greater social movements, withdrew the minds of men once\r\nmore from the arts of peace and the pursuits of scholars. It is not,\r\nthen, until the beginning of the seventeenth century--the time of\r\nGalileo and of Newton--that we find the nations of Europe sufficiently\r\nquiet and secure to permit general attention to intellectual\r\nvocations, although it was a half-century earlier (1543) that\r\nCopernicus left to the world that legacy which revolutionized the\r\ntheories of the astronomers and established as correct the hypothesis\r\nwhich made the sun the centre of the solar system.\r\n\r\nGalileo now began to overturn the speculations of the deductive\r\nphilosophers, and to proclaim the still disputed principle that the\r\nbook of Nature is a trustworthy commentary in the study of theological\r\nand revealed truths, so far as they affect or are affected by science;\r\nhe suffered martyrdom when he proclaimed the fact that God's laws, as\r\nthey now stand, had been instituted without deference to the\r\npreconceived notions of the most ignorant of men. Bruno had a few\r\nyears earlier (1600) been burned at the stake for a similar offense.\r\n\r\nGalileo was perhaps the first, too, to combine invariably in\r\napplication the idea of Plato, the philosophy of Aristotle, and the\r\nmethods of modern experimentation, to form the now universal\r\nscientific method of experimental philosophy. He showed plainly how\r\nthe grouping of ascertained facts, in natural sequence, leads to the\r\nrevelation of the law of that sequence, and indicated the existence of\r\na principle which is now known as the law of continuity--the law that\r\nin all the operations of Nature there is to be seen an unbroken chain\r\nof effect leading from the present back into a known or an unknown\r\npast, toward a cause which may or may not be determinable by science\r\nor known to history.\r\n\r\nGalileo, the Italian, was worthily matched by Newton, the prince of\r\nEnglish philosophers. The science of theoretical mechanics was hardly\r\nbeginning to assume the position which it was afterward given among\r\nthe sciences; and the grand work of collating facts already\r\nascertained, and of definitely stating principles which had previously\r\nbeen vaguely recognized, was splendidly done by Newton. The needs of\r\nphysical astronomy urged this work upon him.\r\n\r\nDa Vinci had, in the latter half of the fifteenth century, summarized\r\nas much of the statics of mechanical philosophy as had, up to his\r\ntime, been given shape; he also rewrote and added very much to what\r\nwas known on the subject of friction, and enunciated its laws. He had\r\nevidently a good idea of the principle of \"virtual velocities,\" that\r\nsimple case of equivalence of work, in a connected system, which has\r\ndone such excellent service since; and with his mechanical philosophy\r\nthis versatile engineer and artist curiously mingled much of physical\r\nscience. Then Stevinus, the \"brave engineer of Bruges,\" a hundred\r\nyears later (1586), alternating office and field work, somewhat after\r\nthe manner of the engineer of to-day, wrote a treatise on mechanics,\r\nwhich showed the value of practical experience and judgment in even\r\nscientific work. And thus the path had been cleared for Newton.\r\n\r\nMeantime, also, Kepler had hit upon the true relations of the\r\ndistances of the planets and their periodic times, after spending half\r\na generation in blindly groping for them, thus furnishing those great\r\nlandmarks of fact in the mechanics of astronomy; and Galileo had\r\nenunciated the laws of motion. Thus the foundation of the science of\r\ndynamics, as distinguished from statics, was laid, and the beginning\r\nwas made of that later science of energetics, of which the philosophy\r\nof the steam-engine is so largely constituted.\r\n\r\nHooke, Huyghens, and others, had already seen some of the principal\r\nconsequences of these laws; but it remained for Newton to enunciate\r\nthem with the precision of a true mathematician, and to base upon them\r\na system of dynamical laws, which, complemented by his announcement of\r\nthe existence of the force of gravitation, and his statement of its\r\nlaws, gave a firm basis for all that the astronomer has since done in\r\nthose quantitative determinations of size, weight, and distance, and\r\nof the movements of the heavenly bodies, which compel the wonder and\r\nadmiration of mankind.\r\n\r\nThe Arabians and Greeks had noticed that the direction taken by a body\r\nfalling under the action of gravitation was directly toward the centre\r\nof the earth, wherever its fall might occur; Galileo had shown, by his\r\nexperiments at Pisa, that the velocity of fall, second after second,\r\nvaried as the numbers 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, etc., and that the distances\r\nvaried as the squares of the total periods of time during which the\r\nbody was falling, and that it was, in British feet, very nearly\r\nsixteen times the square of that time in seconds. Kepler had proved\r\nthat the movements of the heavenly bodies were just such as would\r\noccur under the action of central attractive forces and of centrifugal\r\nforce.\r\n\r\nPutting all these things together, Newton was led to believe that\r\nthere existed a \"force of gravity,\" due to the attraction, by the\r\ngreat mass of the earth, of its own particles and of neighboring\r\nbodies, like the moon, of which force the influence extended as far,\r\nat least, as the latter. He calculated the motion of the earth's\r\nsatellite, on the assumption that his theory and the then accepted\r\nmeasurements of the earth's dimensions were correct, and obtained a\r\nroughly approximate result. Later, in 1679, he revised his\r\ncalculations, using Picard's more accurate determination of the\r\ndimensions of the earth, and obtained a result which precisely tallied\r\nwith careful measurements, made by the astronomers, of the moon's\r\nmotion.\r\n\r\nThe science of mechanics had now, with the publication of Newton's\r\n\"Principia,\" become thoroughly consistent and logically complete, so\r\nfar as was possible without a knowledge of the principles of\r\nenergetics; and Newton's enunciations of the laws of motion, concise\r\nand absolutely perfect as they still seem, were the basis of the whole\r\nscience of dynamics, as applied to bodies moving freely under the\r\naction of applied forces, either constant or variable. They are as\r\nperfect a basis for that science as are the primary principles of\r\ngeometry for the whole beautiful structure which is built up on them.\r\n\r\nThe three perfect qualitative expressions of dynamical law are:\r\n\r\n1. Every free body continues in the state in which it may be, whether\r\nof rest or of rectilinear uniform motion, until compelled to deviate\r\nfrom that state by impressed forces.\r\n\r\n2. Change of motion is proportional to the force impressed, and in the\r\ndirection of the right line in which that force acts.\r\n\r\n3. Action is always opposed by reaction; action and reaction are\r\nequal, and in directly contrary directions.\r\n\r\nWe may add to these principles a definition of a force, which is\r\nequally and absolutely complete:\r\n\r\n_Force_ is that which produces, or tends to produce, motion, or change\r\nof motion, in bodies. It is measured statically by the weight that\r\nwill counterpoise it, or by the pressure which it will produce, and\r\ndynamically by the velocity which it will produce, acting in the unit\r\nof time on the unit of mass.\r\n\r\nThe quantitative determinations of dynamic effects of forces are\r\nalways readily made when it is remembered that the effect of a force\r\nequal to its own weight, when the body is free to move, is to produce\r\nin one second a velocity of 32.2 feet per second, which quantity is\r\nthe unit of dynamic measurement.\r\n\r\n_Work_ is the product of the resistance met in any instance of the\r\nexertion of a force, into the distance through which that force\r\novercomes the resistance.\r\n\r\n_Energy_ is the work which a body is capable of doing, by its weight\r\nor inertia, under given conditions. The energy of a falling body, or\r\nof a flying shot, is about 1/64 its weight multiplied by the square of\r\nits velocity, or, which is the same thing, the product of its weight\r\ninto the height of fall or height due its velocity. These principles\r\nand definitions, with the long-settled definitions of the primary\r\nideas of space and time, were all that were needed to lead the way to\r\nthat grandest of all physical generalizations, the doctrine of the\r\npersistence or conservation of all energy, and to its corollary\r\ndeclaring the equivalence of all forms of energy, and also to the\r\nexperimental demonstration of the transformability of energy from one\r\nmode of existence to another, and its universal existence in the\r\nvarious modes of motion of bodies and of their molecules.\r\n\r\nExperimental physical science had hardly become acknowledged as the\r\nonly and the proper method of acquiring knowledge of natural phenomena\r\nat the time of Newton; but it soon became a generally accepted\r\nprinciple. In physics, Gilbert had made valuable investigations before\r\nNewton, and Galileo's experiments at Pisa had been examples of\r\nsimilarly useful research. In chemistry, it was only when, a century\r\nlater, Lavoisier showed by his splendid example what could be done by\r\nthe skillful and intelligent use of quantitative measurements, and\r\nmade the balance the chemist's most important tool, that a science was\r\nformed comprehending all the facts and laws of chemical change and\r\nmolecular combination. We have already seen how astronomy and\r\nmathematics together led philosophers to the creation and the study of\r\nwhat finally became the science of mechanics, when experiment and\r\nobservation were finally brought to their aid. We can now see how, in\r\nall these physical sciences, four primitive ideas are comprehended:\r\nmatter, force, motion, and space--which latter two terms include all\r\nrelations of position.\r\n\r\nBased on these notions, the science of mechanics comprehends four\r\nsections, which are of general application in the study of all\r\nphysical phenomena. These are:\r\n\r\n_Statics_, which treats of the action and effect of forces.\r\n\r\n_Kinematics_, which treats of relations of motion simply.\r\n\r\n_Dynamics_, or kinetics, which treats of simple motion as an effect of\r\nthe action of forces.\r\n\r\n_Energetics_, which treats of modifications of energy under the action\r\nof forces, and of its transformation from one mode of manifestation to\r\nanother, and from one body to another.\r\n\r\nUnder the latter of these four divisions of mechanical philosophy is\r\ncomprehended that latest of the minor sciences, of which the\r\nheat-engines, and especially the steam-engine, illustrate the most\r\nimportant applications--_Thermo-dynamics_. This science is simply a\r\nwider generalization of principles which, as we have seen, have been\r\nestablished one at a time, and by philosophers widely separated both\r\ngeographically and historically, by both space and time, and which\r\nhave been slowly aggregated to form one after another of the sciences,\r\nand out of which, as we now are beginning to see, we are slowly\r\nevolving wider generalizations, and thus tending toward a condition of\r\nscientific knowledge which renders more and more probable the truth of\r\nCicero's declaration: \"One eternal and immutable law embraces all\r\nthings and all times.\" At the basis of the whole science of energetics\r\nlies a principle which was enunciated before Science had a birthplace\r\nor a name:\r\n\r\n_All that exists, whether matter or force, and in whatever form, is\r\nindestructible, except by the Infinite Power which has created it._\r\n\r\nThat matter is indestructible by finite power became admitted as soon\r\nas the chemists, led by their great teacher Lavoisier, began to apply\r\nthe balance, and were thus able to show that in all chemical change\r\nthere occurs only a modification of form or of combination of\r\nelements, and no loss of matter ever takes place. The \"persistence\" of\r\nenergy was a later discovery, consequent largely upon the experimental\r\ndetermination of the convertibility of heat-energy into other forms\r\nand into mechanical work, for which we are indebted to Rumford and\r\nDavy, and to the determination of the quantivalence anticipated by\r\nNewton, shown and calculated approximately by Colding and Mayer, and\r\nmeasured with great probable accuracy by Joule.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Benjamin Thompson, Count Rumford.]\r\n\r\nThe great fact of the conservation of energy was loosely stated by\r\nNewton, who asserted that the work of friction and the _vis viva_ of\r\nthe system or body arrested by friction were equivalent. In 1798,\r\nBenjamin Thompson, Count Rumford, an American who was then in the\r\nBavarian service, presented a paper[105] to the Royal Society of Great\r\nBritain, in which he stated the results of an experiment which he had\r\nrecently made, proving the immateriality of heat and the\r\ntransformation of mechanical into heat energy. This paper is of very\r\ngreat historical interest, as the now accepted doctrine of the\r\npersistence of energy is a generalization which arose out of a series\r\nof investigations, the most important of which are those which\r\nresulted in the determination of the existence of a definite\r\nquantivalent relation between these two forms of energy and a\r\nmeasurement of its value, now known as the \"mechanical equivalent of\r\nheat.\" His experiment consisted in the determination of the quantity\r\nof heat produced by the boring of a cannon at the arsenal at Munich.\r\n\r\n  [105] \"Philosophical Transactions,\" 1798.\r\n\r\nRumford, after showing that this heat could not have been derived from\r\nany of the surrounding objects, or by compression of the materials\r\nemployed or acted upon, says: \"It appears to me extremely difficult,\r\nif not impossible, to form any distinct idea of anything capable of\r\nbeing excited and communicated in the manner that heat was excited and\r\ncommunicated in these experiments, except it be motion.\"[106] He then\r\ngoes on to urge a zealous and persistent investigation of the laws\r\nwhich govern this motion. He estimates the heat produced by a power\r\nwhich he states could easily be exerted by one horse, and makes it\r\nequal to the \"combustion of nine wax candles, each three-quarters of\r\nan inch in diameter,\" and equivalent to the elevation of \"25.68 pounds\r\nof ice-cold water\" to the boiling-point, or 4,784.4 heat-units.[107]\r\nThe time was stated at \"150 minutes.\" Taking the actual power of\r\nRumford's Bavarian \"one horse\" as the most probable figure, 25,000\r\npounds raised one foot high per minute,[108] this gives the\r\n\"mechanical equivalent\" of the foot-pound as 783.8 heat-units,\r\ndiffering but 1.5 per cent. from the now accepted value.\r\n\r\n  [106] This idea was not by any means original with Rumford. Bacon\r\n  seems to have had the same idea; and Locke says, explicitly enough:\r\n  \"Heat is a very brisk agitation of the insensible parts of the\r\n  object ... so that what in our sensation is heat, in the object is\r\n  nothing but motion.\"\r\n\r\n  [107] The British heat-unit is the quantity of heat required to heat\r\n  one pound of water 1 deg. Fahr. from the temperature of maximum density.\r\n\r\n  [108] Rankine gives 25,920 foot-pounds per minute--or 432 per\r\n  second--for the average draught-horse in Great Britain, which is\r\n  probably too high for Bavaria. The engineer's \"horse-power\"--33,000\r\n  foot-pounds per minute--is far in excess of the average power of\r\n  even a good draught-horse, which latter is sometimes taken as\r\n  two-thirds the former.\r\n\r\nHad Rumford been able to eliminate all losses of heat by evaporation,\r\nradiation, and conduction, to which losses he refers, and to measure\r\nthe power exerted with accuracy, the approximation would have been\r\nstill closer. Rumford thus made the experimental discovery of the real\r\nnature of heat, proving it to be a form of energy, and, publishing\r\nthe fact a half-century before the now standard determinations were\r\nmade, gave us a very close approximation to the value of the\r\nheat-equivalent. Rumford also observed that the heat generated was\r\n\"exactly proportional to the force with which the two surfaces are\r\npressed together, and to the rapidity of the friction,\" which is a\r\nsimple statement of equivalence between the quantity of work done, or\r\nenergy expended, and the quantity of heat produced. This was the first\r\ngreat step toward the formation of a Science of Thermo-dynamics.\r\nRumford's work was the corner-stone of the science.\r\n\r\nSir Humphry Davy, a little later (1799), published the details of an\r\nexperiment which conclusively confirmed these deductions from\r\nRumford's work. He rubbed two pieces of ice together, and found that\r\nthey were melted by the friction so produced. He thereupon concluded:\r\n\"It is evident that ice by friction is converted into water....\r\nFriction, consequently, does not diminish the capacity of bodies for\r\nheat.\"\r\n\r\nBacon and Newton, and Hooke and Boyle, seem to have anticipated--long\r\nbefore Rumford's time--all later philosophers, in admitting the\r\nprobable correctness of that modern dynamical, or vibratory, theory of\r\nheat which considers it a mode of motion; but Davy, in 1812, for the\r\nfirst time, stated plainly and precisely the real nature of heat,\r\nsaying: \"The immediate cause of the phenomenon of heat, then, is\r\nmotion, and the laws of its communication are precisely the same as\r\nthe laws of the communication of motion.\" The basis of this opinion\r\nwas the same that had previously been noted by Rumford.\r\n\r\nSo much having been determined, it became at once evident that the\r\ndetermination of the exact value of the mechanical equivalent of heat\r\nwas simply a matter of experiment; and during the succeeding\r\ngeneration this determination was made, with greater or less\r\nexactness, by several distinguished men. It was also equally evident\r\nthat the laws governing the new science of thermo-dynamics could be\r\nmathematically expressed.\r\n\r\nFourier had, before the date last given, applied mathematical analysis\r\nin the solution of problems relating to the transfer of heat without\r\ntransformation, and his \"Theorie de la Chaleur\" contained an\r\nexceedingly beautiful treatment of the subject. Sadi Carnot, twelve\r\nyears later (1824), published his \"Reflexions sur la Puissance Motrice\r\ndu Feu,\" in which he made a first attempt to express the principles\r\ninvolved in the application of heat to the production of mechanical\r\neffect. Starting with the axiom that a body which, having passed\r\nthrough a series of conditions modifying its temperature, is returned\r\nto \"its primitive physical state as to density, temperature, and\r\nmolecular constitution,\" must contain the same quantity of heat which\r\nit had contained originally, he shows that the efficiency of\r\nheat-engines is to be determined by carrying the working fluid through\r\na complete cycle, beginning and ending with the same set of\r\nconditions. Carnot had not then accepted the vibratory theory of heat,\r\nand consequently was led into some errors; but, as will be seen\r\nhereafter, the idea just expressed is one of the most important\r\ndetails of a theory of the steam-engine.\r\n\r\nSeguin, who has already been mentioned as one of the first to use the\r\nfire-tubular boiler for locomotive engines, published in 1839 a work,\r\n\"Sur l'Influence des Chemins de Fer,\" in which he gave the requisite\r\ndata for a rough determination of the value of the mechanical\r\nequivalent of heat, although he does not himself deduce that value.\r\n\r\nDr. Julius R. Mayer, three years later (1842), published the results\r\nof a very ingenious and quite closely approximate calculation of the\r\nheat-equivalent, basing his estimate upon the work necessary to\r\ncompress air, and on the specific heats of the gas, the idea being\r\nthat the work of compression is the equivalent of the heat generated.\r\nSeguin had taken the converse operation, taking the loss of heat of\r\nexpanding steam as the equivalent of the work done by the steam while\r\nexpanding. The latter also was the first to point out the fact,\r\nafterward experimentally proved by Hirn, that the fluid exhausted from\r\nan engine should heat the water of condensation less than would the\r\nsame fluid when originally taken into the engine.\r\n\r\nA Danish engineer, Colding, at about the same time (1843), published\r\nthe results of experiments made to determine the same quantity; but\r\nthe best and most extended work, and that which is now almost\r\nuniversally accepted as standard, was done by a British investigator.\r\n\r\nJames Prescott Joule commenced the experimental investigations which\r\nhave made him famous at some time previous to 1843, at which date he\r\npublished, in the _Philosophical Magazine_, his earliest method. His\r\nfirst determination gave 770 foot-pounds. During the succeeding five\r\nor six years Joule repeated his work, adopting a considerable variety\r\nof methods, and obtaining very variable results. One method was to\r\ndetermine the heat produced by forcing air through tubes; another, and\r\nhis usual plan, was to turn a paddle-wheel by a definite power in a\r\nknown weight of water. He finally, in 1849, concluded these\r\nresearches.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: James Prescott Joule.]\r\n\r\nThe method of calculating the mechanical equivalent of heat which was\r\nadopted by Dr. Mayer, of Heilbronn, is as beautiful as it is\r\ningenious: Conceive two equal portions of atmospheric air to be\r\ninclosed, at the same temperature--as at the freezing-point--in\r\nvessels each capable of containing one cubic foot; communicate heat to\r\nboth, retaining the one portion at the original volume, and permitting\r\nthe other to expand under a constant pressure equal to that of the\r\natmosphere. In each vessel there will be inclosed 0.08073 pound, or\r\n1.29 ounce, of air. When, at the same temperature, the one has doubled\r\nits pressure and the other has doubled its volume, each will be at a\r\ntemperature of 525.2 deg. Fahr., or 274 deg. C, and each will have double the\r\noriginal temperature, as measured on the absolute scale from the zero\r\nof heat-motion. But the one will have absorbed but 6-3/4 British\r\nthermal units, while the other will have absorbed 9-1/2. In the first\r\ncase, all of this heat will have been employed in simply increasing\r\nthe temperature of the air; in the second case, the temperature of the\r\nair will have been equally increased, and, besides, a certain amount\r\nof work--2,116.3 foot-pounds--must have been done in overcoming the\r\nresistance of the air; it is to this latter action that we must debit\r\nthe additional heat which has disappeared. Now, 2,116.3/(2-3/4) = 770\r\nfoot-pounds per heat-unit--almost precisely the value derived from\r\nJoule's experiments. Had Mayer's measurement been absolutely accurate,\r\nthe result of his calculation would have been an exact determination\r\nof the heat-equivalent, provided no heat is, in this case, lost by\r\ninternal work.\r\n\r\nJoule's most probably accurate measure was obtained by the use of a\r\npaddle-wheel revolving in water or other fluid. A copper vessel\r\ncontained a carefully weighed portion of the fluid, and at the bottom\r\nwas a step, on which stood a vertical spindle carrying the\r\npaddle-wheel. This wheel was turned by cords passing over\r\nnicely-balanced grooved wheels, the axles of which were carried on\r\nfriction-rollers. Weights hung at the ends of these cords were the\r\nmoving forces. Falling to the ground, they exerted an easily and\r\naccurately determinable amount of work, _W_ x _H_, which turned the\r\npaddle-wheel a definite number of revolutions, warming the water by\r\nthe production of an amount of heat exactly equivalent to the amount\r\nof work done. After the weight had been raised and this operation\r\nrepeated a sufficient number of times, the quantity of heat\r\ncommunicated to the water was carefully determined and compared with\r\nthe amount of work expended in its development. Joule also used a pair\r\nof disks of iron rubbing against each other in a vessel of mercury,\r\nand measured the heat thus developed by friction, comparing it with\r\nthe work done. The average of forty experiments with water gave the\r\nequivalent 772.692 foot-pounds; fifty with mercury gave 774.083;\r\ntwenty with cast-iron gave 774.987--the temperature of the apparatus\r\nbeing from 55 deg. to 60 deg. Fahr.\r\n\r\nJoule also determined, by experiment, the fact that the expansion of\r\nair or other gas without doing work produces no change of temperature,\r\nwhich fact is predicable from the now known principles of\r\nthermo-dynamics. He stated the results of his researches relating to\r\nthe mechanical equivalent of heat as follows:\r\n\r\n1. The heat produced by the friction of bodies, whether solid or\r\nliquid, is always proportional to the quantity of work expended.\r\n\r\n2. The quantity required to increase the temperature of a pound of\r\nwater (weighed _in vacuo_ at 55 deg. to 60 deg. Fahr.) by one degree requires\r\nfor its production the expenditure of a force measured by the fall of\r\n772 pounds from a height of one foot. This quantity is now generally\r\ncalled \"Joule's equivalent.\"\r\n\r\nDuring this series of experiments, Joule also deduced the position of\r\nthe \"absolute zero,\" the point at which heat-motion ceases, and stated\r\nit to be about 480 deg. Fahr. below the freezing-point of water, which is\r\nnot very far from the probably true value,-493.2 deg. Fahr. (-273 deg. C.), as\r\ndeduced afterward from more precise data.\r\n\r\nThe result of these, and of the later experiments of Hirn and others,\r\nhas been the admission of the following principle:\r\n\r\nHeat-energy and mechanical energy are mutually convertible and have a\r\ndefinite equivalence, the British thermal unit being equivalent to 772\r\nfoot-pounds of work, and the metric _calorie_ to 423.55, or, as\r\nusually taken, 424 kilogrammetres. The exact measure is not fully\r\ndetermined, however.\r\n\r\nIt has now become generally admitted that all forms of energy due to\r\nphysical forces are mutually convertible with a definite\r\nquantivalence; and it is not yet determined that even vital and mental\r\nenergy do not fall within the same great generalization. This\r\nquantivalence is the sole basis of the science of Energetics.\r\n\r\nThe study of this science has been, up to the present time,\r\nprincipally confined to that portion which comprehends the relations\r\nof heat and mechanical energy. In the study of this department of the\r\nscience, thermo-dynamics, Rankine, Clausius, Thompson, Hirn, and\r\nothers have acquired great distinction. In the investigations which\r\nhave been made by these authorities, the methods of transfer of heat\r\nand of modification of physical state in gases and vapors, when a\r\nchange occurs in the form of the energy considered, have been the\r\nsubjects of especial study.\r\n\r\nAccording to the law of Boyle and Marriotte, the expansion of such\r\nfluids follows a law expressed graphically by the hyperbola, and\r\nalgebraically by the expression PV^{_x_} = A, in which, with\r\nunchanging temperature, _x_ is equal to 1. One of the first and most\r\nevident deductions from the principles of the equivalence of the\r\nseveral forms of energy is that the value of x must increase as the\r\nenergy expended in expansion increases. This change is very marked\r\nwith a vapor like steam--which, expanded without doing work, has an\r\nexponent less than unity, and which, when doing work by expanding\r\nbehind a piston, partially condenses, the value of _x_ increases to,\r\nin the case of steam, 1.111 according to Rankine, or, probably more\r\ncorrectly, to 1.135 or more, according to Zeuner and Grashof. This\r\nfact has an important bearing upon the theory of the steam-engine, and\r\nwe are indebted to Rankine for the first complete treatise on that\r\ntheory as thus modified.\r\n\r\nProf. Rankine began his investigations as early as 1849, at which time\r\nhe proposed his theory of the molecular constitution of matter, now\r\nwell known as the theory of molecular vortices. He supposes a system\r\nof whirling rings or vortices of heat-motion, and bases his\r\nphilosophy upon that hypothesis, supposing sensible heat to be\r\nemployed in changing the velocity of the particles, latent heat to be\r\nthe work of altering the dimensions of the orbits, and considering the\r\neffort of each vortex to enlarge its boundaries to be due to\r\ncentrifugal force. He distinguished between real and apparent specific\r\nheat, and showed that the two methods of absorption of heat, in the\r\ncase of the heating of a fluid, that due to simple increase of\r\ntemperature and that due to increase of volume, should be\r\ndistinguished; he proposed, for the latter quantity, the term\r\nheat-potential, and for the sum of the two, the name of thermo-dynamic\r\nfunction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Prof. W. J. M. Rankine.]\r\n\r\nCarnot had stated, a quarter of a century earlier, that the efficiency\r\nof a heat-engine is a function of the two limits of temperature\r\nbetween which the machine is worked, and not of the nature of the\r\nworking substance--an assertion which is quite true where the material\r\ndoes not change its physical state while working. Rankine now deduced\r\nthat \"general equation of thermo-dynamics\" which expresses\r\nalgebraically the relations between heat and mechanical energy, when\r\nenergy is changing from the one state to the other, in which equation\r\nis given, for any assumed change of the fluids, the quantity of heat\r\ntransformed. He showed that steam in the engine must be partially\r\nliquefied by the process of expanding against a resistance, and proved\r\nthat the total heat of a perfect gas must increase with rise of\r\ntemperature at a rate proportional to its specific heat under constant\r\npressure.\r\n\r\nRankine, in 1850, showed the inaccuracy of the then accepted value,\r\n0.2669, of the specific heat of air under constant pressure, and\r\ncalculated its value as 0.24. Three years later, the experiments of\r\nRegnault gave the value 0.2379, and Rankine, recalculating it, made it\r\n0.2377. In 1851, Rankine continued his discussion of the subject, and,\r\nby his own theory, corroborated Thompson's law giving the efficiency\r\nof a perfect heat-engine as the quotient of the range of working\r\ntemperature to the temperature of the upper limit, measured from the\r\nabsolute zero.\r\n\r\nDuring this period, Clausius, the German physicist, was working on the\r\nsame subject, taking quite a different method, studying the mechanical\r\neffects of heat in gases, and deducing, almost simultaneously with\r\nRankine (1850), the general equation which lies at the beginning of\r\nthe theory of the equivalence of heat and mechanical energy. He found\r\nthat the probable zero of heat-motion is at such a point that the\r\nCarnot function must be approximately the reciprocal of the \"absolute\"\r\ntemperature, as measured with the air thermometer, or, stated exactly,\r\nthat quantity as determined by a perfect gas thermometer. He confirmed\r\nRankine's conclusion relative to the liquefaction of saturated vapors\r\nwhen expanding against resistance, and, in 1854, adapted Carnot's\r\nprinciple to the new theory, and showed that his idea of the\r\nreversible engine and of the performance of a cycle in testing the\r\nchanges produced still held good, notwithstanding Carnot's ignorance\r\nof the true nature of heat. Clausius also gave us the extremely\r\nimportant principle: It is impossible for a self-acting machine,\r\nunaided, to transfer heat from one body at a low temperature to\r\nanother having a higher temperature.\r\n\r\nSimultaneously with Rankine and Clausius, Prof. William Thomson was\r\nengaged in researches in thermo-dynamics (1850). He was the first to\r\nexpress the principle of Carnot as adapted to the modern theory by\r\nClausius in the now generally quoted propositions:[109]\r\n\r\n  [109] _Vide_ Tait's admirable \"Sketch of Thermodynamics,\" second\r\n  edition, Edinburgh, 1877.\r\n\r\n1. When equal mechanical effects are produced by purely thermal\r\naction, equal quantities of heat are produced or disappear by\r\ntransformation of energy.\r\n\r\n2. If, in any engine, a reversal effects complete inversion of all the\r\nphysical and mechanical details of its operation, it is a perfect\r\nengine, and produces maximum effect with any given quantity of heat\r\nand with any fixed limits of range of temperature.\r\n\r\nWilliam Thomson and James Thompson showed, among the earliest of their\r\ndeductions from these principles, the fact, afterward confirmed by\r\nexperiment, that the melting-point of ice should be lowered by\r\npressure 0.0135 deg. Fahr, for each atmosphere, and that a body which\r\ncontracts while being heated will always have its temperature\r\ndecreased by sudden compression. Thomson applied the principles of\r\nenergetics in extended investigations in the department of\r\nelectricity, while Helmholtz carried some of the same methods into his\r\nfavorite study of acoustics.\r\n\r\nThe application of now well-settled principles to the physics of gases\r\nled to many interesting and important deductions: Clausius explained\r\nthe relations between the volume, density, temperature, and pressure\r\nof gases, and their modifications; Maxwell reestablished the\r\nexperimentally determined law of Dalton and Charles, known also as\r\nthat of Gay-Lussac (1801), which asserts that all masses of equal\r\npressure, volume, and temperature, contain equal numbers of molecules.\r\nOn the Continent of Europe, also, Hirn, Zeuner, Grashof, Tresca,\r\nLaboulaye, and others have, during the same period and since,\r\ncontinued and greatly extended these theoretical researches.\r\n\r\nDuring all this time, a vast amount of experimental work has also been\r\ndone, resulting in the determination of important data without which\r\nall the preceding labor would have been fruitless. Of those who have\r\nengaged in such work, Cagniard de la Tour, Andrews, Regnault, Hirn,\r\nFairbairn and Tate, Laboulaye, Tresca, and a few others have directed\r\ntheir researches in this most important direction with the special\r\nobject of aiding in the advancement of the new-born sciences. By the\r\nmiddle of the present century, the time which we are now studying,\r\nthis set of data was tolerably complete. Boyle had, two hundred years\r\nbefore, discovered and published the law, which is now known by his\r\nname[110] and by that of Marriotte,[111] that the pressure of a gas\r\nvaries inversely as its volume and directly as its density; Dr. Black\r\nand James Watt discovered, a hundred years later (1760), the latent\r\nheat of vapors, and Watt determined the method of expansion of steam;\r\nDalton, in England, and Gay-Lussac, in France, showed, at the\r\nbeginning of the nineteenth century, that all gaseous fluids are\r\nexpanded by equal fractions of their volume by equal increments of\r\ntemperature; Watt and Robison had given tables of the elastic force of\r\nsteam, and Gren had shown that, at the temperature of boiling water,\r\nthe pressure of steam was equal to that of the atmosphere; Dalton,\r\nUre, and others proved (1800-1818) that the law connecting\r\ntemperatures and pressures of steam was expressed by a geometrical\r\nratio; and Biot had already given an approximate formula, when\r\nSouthern introduced another, which is still in use.\r\n\r\n  [110] \"New Experiments, Physico-Mechanical, etc., touching the\r\n  Spring of Air,\" 1662.\r\n\r\n  [111] \"De la Nature de l'Air,\" 1676.\r\n\r\nThe French Government established a commission in 1823 to experiment\r\nwith a view to the institution of legislation regulating the working\r\nof steam-engines and boilers; and this commission, MM. de Prony,\r\nArago, Girard, and Dulong, determined quite accurately the\r\ntemperatures of steam under pressures running up to twenty-four\r\natmospheres, giving a formula for the calculation of the one quantity,\r\nthe other being known. Ten years later, the Government of the United\r\nStates instituted similar experiments under the direction of the\r\nFranklin Institute.\r\n\r\nThe marked distinction between gases, like oxygen and hydrogen, and\r\ncondensible vapors, like steam and carbonic acid, had been, at this\r\ntime, shown by Cagniard de la Tour, who, in 1822, studied their\r\nbehavior at high temperatures and under very great pressures. He found\r\nthat, when a vapor was confined in a glass tube in presence of the\r\nsame substance in the liquid state, as where steam and water were\r\nconfined together, if the temperature was increased to a certain\r\ndefinite point, the whole mass suddenly became of uniform character,\r\nand the previously existing line of demarkation vanished, the whole\r\nmass of fluid becoming, as he inferred, gaseous. It was at about this\r\ntime that Faraday made known his then novel experiments, in which\r\ngases which had been before supposed permanent were liquefied, simply\r\nby subjecting them to enormous pressures. He then also first stated\r\nthat, above certain temperatures, liquefaction of vapors was\r\nimpossible, however great the pressure.\r\n\r\nFaraday's conclusion was justified by the researches of Dr. Andrews,\r\nwho has since most successfully extended the investigation commenced\r\nby Cagniard de la Tour, and who has shown that, at a certain point,\r\nwhich he calls the \"critical point,\" the properties of the two states\r\nof the fluid fade into each other, and that, at that point, the two\r\nbecome continuous. With carbonic acid, this occurs at 75 atmospheres,\r\nabout 1,125 pounds per square inch, a pressure which would\r\ncounterbalance a column of mercury 60 yards, or nearly as many metres,\r\nhigh. The temperature at this point is about 90 deg. Fahr., or 31 deg. Cent.\r\nFor ether, the temperature is 370 deg. Fahr., and the pressure 38\r\natmospheres; for alcohol, they are 498 deg. Fahr., and 120 atmospheres;\r\nand for bisulphide of carbon, 505 deg. Fahr., and 67 atmospheres. For\r\nwater, the pressure is too high to be determined; but the temperature\r\nis about 775 deg. Fahr., or 413 deg. Cent.\r\n\r\nDonny and Dufour have shown that these normal properties of vapors and\r\nliquids are subject to modification by certain conditions, as\r\npreviously (1818) noted by Gay-Lussac, and have pointed out the\r\nbearing of this fact upon the safety of steam-boilers. It was\r\ndiscovered that the boiling-point of water could be elevated far above\r\nits ordinary temperature of ebullition by expedients which deprive the\r\nliquid of the air usually condensed within its mass, and which prevent\r\ncontact with rough or metallic surfaces. By suspension in a mixture of\r\noils which is of nearly the same density, Dufour raised drops of water\r\nunder atmospheric pressure to a temperature of 356 deg. Fahr.--180 deg.\r\nCent.--the temperature of steam of about 150 pounds per square inch.\r\nProf. James Thompson has, on theoretical grounds, indicated that a\r\nsomewhat similar action may enable vapor, under some conditions, to be\r\ncooled below the normal temperature of condensation, without\r\nliquefaction.\r\n\r\nFairbairn and Tate repeated the attempt to determine the volume and\r\ntemperature of water at pressures extending beyond those in use in the\r\nsteam-engine, and incomplete determinations have also been made by\r\nothers.\r\n\r\nRegnault is the standard authority on these data. His experiments\r\n(1847) were made at the expense of the French Government, and under\r\nthe direction of the French Academy. They were wonderfully accurate,\r\nand extended through a very wide range of temperatures and pressures.\r\nThe results remain standard after the lapse of a quarter of a century,\r\nand are regarded as models of precise physical work.[112]\r\n\r\n  [112] _See_ Porter on the Steam-Engine Indicator for the best set of\r\n  Regnault's tables generally accessible.\r\n\r\nRegnault found that the total heat of steam is not constant, but that\r\nthe latent heat varies, and that the sum of the latent and sensible\r\nheats, or the total heat, increases 0.305 of a degree for each degree\r\nof increase in the sensible heat, making 0.305 the specific heat of\r\nsaturated steam. He found the specific heat of superheated steam to be\r\n0.4805.\r\n\r\nRegnault promptly detected the fact that steam was not subject to\r\nBoyle's law, and showed that the difference is very marked. In\r\nexpressing his results, he not only tabulated them but also laid them\r\ndown graphically; he further determined exact constants for Biot's\r\nalgebraic expression,\r\n\r\n  log. _p_ = _a_ - _b_A^{_x_} - _c_B^{_x_};\r\n\r\nmaking _x_ = 20 + _t_ deg. Cent.; _a_ = 6.264035; log. _b_ = 0.1397743;\r\nlog. _c_ = 0.6924351; log. A = [=1].9940493, and log. B = [=1].9983439;\r\n_p_ is the pressure in atmospheres. Regnault, in the expression for the\r\ntotal heat, H = A + _bt_, determined on the centigrade scale [theta] =\r\n606.5 + 0.305 _t_ Cent. For the Fahrenheit scale, we have the\r\nfollowing equivalent expressions:\r\n\r\n  H = 1,113.44 deg. + 0.305 _t_ deg. Fahr., if measured from 0 deg. Fahr.\r\n    = 1,091.9 deg.  + 0.305 (_t_ deg. - 32) Fahr.,;   } if measured from\r\n    = 1,081.94 deg. + 0.305 _t_ deg. Fahr.,           } the freezing-point.\r\n\r\nFor latent heat, we have:\r\n\r\n  L = 606.5 deg. - 0.695 _t_ deg. Cent.\r\n    = 1,091.7 deg.- 0.695 (_t_ deg. - 32) Fahr.\r\n    = 1,113.94 deg.- 0.695 _t_ deg. Fahr.\r\n\r\nSince Regnault's time, nothing of importance has been done in this\r\ndirection. There still remains much work to be done in the extension\r\nof the research to higher pressures, and under conditions which obtain\r\nin the operation of the steam-engine. The volumes and densities of\r\nsteam require further study, and the behavior of steam in the engine\r\nis still but little known, otherwise than theoretically. Even the true\r\nvalue of Joule's equivalent is not undisputed.\r\n\r\nSome of the most recent experimental work bearing directly upon the\r\nphilosophy of the steam-engine is that of Hirn, whose determination of\r\nthe value of the mechanical equivalent was less than two per cent.\r\nbelow that of Joule. Hirn tested by experiment, in 1853, and\r\nrepeatedly up to 1876, the analytical work of Rankine, which led to\r\nthe conclusion that steam doing work by expansion must become\r\ngradually liquefied. Constructing a glass steam-engine cylinder, he\r\nwas enabled to see plainly the clouds of mist which were produced by\r\nthe expansion of steam behind the piston, where Regnault's experiments\r\nprove that the steam should become drier and superheated, were no heat\r\ntransformed into mechanical energy. As will be seen hereafter, this\r\ngreat discovery of Rankine is more important in its bearing upon the\r\ntheory of the steam-engine than any made during the century. Hirn's\r\nconfirmation stands, in value, beside the original discovery. In 1858\r\nHirn confirmed the work of Mayer and Joule by determining the work\r\ndone and the carbonic acid produced, as well as the increased\r\ntemperature due to their presence, where men were set at work in a\r\ntreadmill; he found the elevation of temperature to be much greater in\r\nproportion to gas produced when the men were resting than when they\r\nwere at work. He thus proved conclusively the conversion of\r\nheat-energy into mechanical work. It was from these experiments that\r\nHelmholtz deduced the \"modulus of efficiency\" of the human machine at\r\none-fifth, and concluded that the heart works with eight times the\r\nefficiency of a locomotive-engine, thus confirming a statement of\r\nRumford, who asserted the higher efficiency of the animal.\r\n\r\nHirn's most important experiments in this department were made upon\r\nsteam-engines of considerable size, including simple and compound\r\nengines, and using steam sometimes saturated and sometimes superheated\r\nto temperatures as high, on some occasions, as 340 deg. Cent. He\r\ndetermined the work done, the quantity of heat entering, and the\r\namount rejected from, the steam-cylinder, and thus obtained a coarse\r\napproximation to the value of the heat-equivalent. His figure varied\r\nfrom 296 to 337 kilogrammetres. But, in all cases, the loss of heat\r\ndue to work done was marked, and, while these researches could not, in\r\nthe nature of the case, give accurate quantitative results, they are\r\nof great value as qualitatively confirming Mayer and Joule, and\r\nproving the transformation of energy.\r\n\r\nThus, as we have seen, experimental investigation and analytical\r\nresearch have together created a new science, and the philosophy of\r\nthe steam-engine has at last been given a complete and well-defined\r\nform, enabling the intelligent engineer to comprehend the operation of\r\nthe machine, to perceive the conditions of efficiency, and to look\r\nforward in a well-settled direction for further advances in its\r\nimprovement and in the increase of its efficiency.\r\n\r\nA very concise _resume_ of the principal facts and laws bearing upon\r\nthe philosophy of the steam-engine will form a fitting conclusion to\r\nthis historical sketch.\r\n\r\nThe term \"energy\" was first used by Dr. Young as the equivalent of the\r\nwork of a moving body, in his hardly yet obsolete \"Lectures on Natural\r\nPhilosophy.\"\r\n\r\nEnergy is the capacity of a moving body to overcome resistance offered\r\nto its motion; it is measured either by the product of the mean\r\nresistance into the space through which it is overcome, or by the\r\nhalf-product of the mass of the body into the square of its velocity.\r\nKinetic energy is the actual energy of a moving body; potential energy\r\nis the measure of the work which a body is capable of doing under\r\ncertain conditions which, without expending energy, may be made to\r\naffect it, as by the breaking of a cord by which a weight is\r\nsuspended, or by firing a mass of explosive material. The British\r\nmeasure of energy is the foot-pound; the metric measure is the\r\nkilogrammetre.\r\n\r\nEnergy, whether kinetic or potential, may be observable and due to\r\nmass-motion; or it may be invisible and due to molecular movements.\r\nThe energy of a heavenly body or of a cannon-shot, and that of heat or\r\nof electrical action, are illustrations of the two classes. In Nature\r\nwe find utilizable potential energy in fuel, in food, in any available\r\nhead of water, and in available chemical affinities. We find kinetic\r\nenergy in the motion of the winds and the flow of running water, in\r\nthe heat-motion of the sun's rays, in heat-currents on the earth, and\r\nin many intermittent movements of bodies acted on by applied forces,\r\nnatural or artificial. The potential energy of fuel and of food has\r\nalready been seen to have been derived, at an earlier period, from the\r\nkinetic energy of the sun's rays, the fuel or the food being thus made\r\na storehouse or reservoir of energy. It is also seen that the animal\r\nsystem is simply a \"mechanism of transmission\" for energy, and does\r\nnot create but simply diverts it to any desired direction of\r\napplication.\r\n\r\nAll the available forms of energy can be readily traced back to a\r\ncommon origin in the potential energy of a universe of nebulous\r\nsubstance (chaos), consisting of infinitely diffused matter of\r\nimmeasurably slight density, whose \"energy of position\" had been,\r\nsince the creation, gradually going through a process of\r\ntransformation into the several forms of kinetic and potential energy\r\nabove specified, through intermediate methods of action which are\r\nusually still in operation, such as the potential energy of chemical\r\naffinity, and the kinetic forms of energy seen in solar radiation, the\r\nrotation of the earth, and the heat of its interior.\r\n\r\nThe _measure_ of any given quantity of energy, whatever may be its\r\nform, is the product of the resistance which it is capable of\r\novercoming into the space through which it can move against that\r\nresistance, i. e., by the product RS. Or it is measured by the\r\nequivalent expressions (MV^{2})/2, or WV^{2}/2_g_, in which W is\r\nthe weight, M is the \"mass\" of matter in motion, V the velocity, and\r\n_g_ the dynamic measure of the force of gravity, 32-1/6 feet, or 9.8\r\nmetres, per second.\r\n\r\nThere are three great laws of energetics:\r\n\r\n1. The sum total of the energy of the universe is invariable.\r\n\r\n2. The several forms of energy are interconvertible, and possess an\r\nexact quantitative equivalence.\r\n\r\n3. The tendency of all forms of kinetic energy is continually toward\r\nreduction to forms of molecular motion, and to their final dissipation\r\nuniformly throughout space.\r\n\r\nThe history of the first two of these laws has already been traced.\r\nThe latter was first enunciated by Prof. Sir William Thomson in 1853.\r\nUndissipated energy is called \"Entrophy.\"\r\n\r\nThe science of thermo-dynamics is, as has been stated, a branch of the\r\nscience of energetics, and is the only branch of that science in the\r\ndomain of the physicist which has been very much studied. This branch\r\nof science, which is restricted to the consideration of the relations\r\nof heat-energy to mechanical energy, is based upon the great fact\r\ndetermined by Rumford and Joule, and considers the behavior of those\r\nfluids which are used in heat-engines as the media through which\r\nenergy is transferred from the one form to the other. As now accepted,\r\nit assumes the correctness of the hypothesis of the dynamic theory of\r\nfluids, which supposes their expansive force to be due to the motion\r\nof their molecules.\r\n\r\nThis idea is as old as Lucretius, and was distinctly expressed by\r\nBernouilli, Le Sage and Prevost, and Herapath. Joule recalled\r\nattention to this idea, in 1848, as explaining the pressure of gases\r\nby the impact of their molecules upon the sides of the containing\r\nvessels. Helmholtz, ten years later, beautifully developed the\r\nmathematics of media composed of moving, frictionless particles, and\r\nClausius has carried on the work still further.\r\n\r\nThe general conception of a gas, as held to-day, including the\r\nvortex-atom theory of Thomson and Rankine, supposes all bodies to\r\nconsist of small particles called molecules, each of which is a\r\nchemical aggregation of its ultimate parts or atoms. These molecules\r\nare in a state of continual agitation, which is known as heat-motion.\r\nThe higher the temperature, the more violent this agitation; the total\r\nquantity of motion is measured as _vis viva_ by the half-product of\r\nthe mass into the square of the velocity of molecular movement, or in\r\nheat-units by the same product divided by Joule's equivalent. In\r\nsolids, the range of motion is circumscribed, and change of form\r\ncannot take place. In fluids, the motion of the molecules has become\r\nsufficiently violent to enable them to break out of this range, and\r\ntheir motion is then no longer definitely restricted.\r\n\r\nThe laws of thermo-dynamics are, according to Rankine:\r\n\r\n1. Heat-energy and mechanical energy are mutually convertible, one\r\nBritish thermal unit being the equivalent in heat-energy of 772\r\nfoot-pounds of mechanical energy, and one metric _calorie_ equal to\r\n423.55 kilogrammetres of work.\r\n\r\n2. The energy due to the heat of each of the several equal parts into\r\nwhich a uniformly hot substance may be divided is the same; and the\r\ntotal heat-energy of the mass is equal to the sum of the energies of\r\nits parts.[113]\r\n\r\n  [113] This uniformity is not seen where a substance is changing its\r\n  physical state while developing its heat-energy, as occurs with\r\n  steam doing work while expanding.\r\n\r\nIt follows that the work performed by the transformation of the energy\r\nof heat, during any indefinitely small variation of the state of a\r\nsubstance as respects temperature, is measured by the product of the\r\nabsolute temperature into the variation of a \"function,\" which\r\nfunction is the rate of variation of the work so done with\r\ntemperature. This function is the quantity called by Rankine the\r\n\"heat-potential\" of the substance for the given kind of work. A\r\nsimilar function, which comprehends the total heat-variation,\r\nincluding both heat transformed and heat needed to effect accompanying\r\nphysical changes, is called the \"thermo-dynamic function.\" Rankine's\r\nexpression for the general equation of thermo-dynamics includes the\r\nlatter, and is given by him as follows:\r\n\r\n  J_dh_ = _d_H = _kd_[tau] + [tau]_d_F = [tau]_d_[phi],\r\n\r\nin which J is Joule's equivalent, _dh_ the variation of total heat in\r\nthe substance, _kd_[tau] the product of the \"dynamic specific heat\"\r\ninto the variation of temperature, or the total heat demanded to\r\nproduce other changes than a transformation of energy, and [tau]_d_F\r\nis the work done by the transformation of heat-energy, or the product\r\nof the absolute temperature, [tau], into the differential of the\r\nheat-potential. [phi] is the thermo-dynamic function, and\r\n[tau]_d_[phi] measures the whole heat needed to produce,\r\nsimultaneously, a certain amount of work or of mechanical energy, and,\r\nat the same time, to change the temperature of the working substance.\r\n\r\nStudying the behavior of gases and vapors, it is found that the work\r\ndone when they are used, like steam, in heat-engines, consists of\r\nthree parts:\r\n\r\n(_a._) The change effected in the total actual heat-motion of the\r\nfluid.\r\n\r\n(_b._) That heat which is expended in the production of internal work.\r\n\r\n(_c._) That heat which is expended in doing the external work of\r\nexpansion.\r\n\r\nIn any case in which the total heat expended exceeds that due the\r\nproduction of work on external bodies, the excess so supplied is so\r\nmuch added to the intrinsic energy of the substance absorbing it.\r\n\r\nThe application of these laws to the working of steam in the engine is\r\na comparatively recent step in the philosophy of the steam-engine, and\r\nwe are indebted to Rankine for the first, and as yet only, extended\r\nand in any respect complete treatise embodying these now accepted\r\nprinciples.\r\n\r\nIt was fifteen years after the publication of the first logical theory\r\nof the steam-engine, by Pambour,[114] before Rankine, in 1859, issued\r\nthe most valuable of all his works, \"The Steam-Engine and other Prime\r\nMovers.\" The work is far too abstruse for the general reader, and is\r\neven difficult reading for many accomplished engineers. It is\r\nexcellent beyond praise, however, as a treatise on the thermo-dynamics\r\nof heat-engines. It will be for his successors the work of years to\r\nextend the application of the laws which he has worked out, and to\r\nplace the results of his labors before students in a readily\r\ncomprehended form.\r\n\r\n  [114] \"Theorie de la Machine a Vapeur,\" par le Chevalier F. M. G. de\r\n  Pambour, Paris, 1844.\r\n\r\nWilliam J. Macquorn Rankine, the Scotch engineer and philosopher, will\r\nalways be remembered as the author of the modern philosophy of the\r\nsteam-engine, and as the greatest among the founders of the science of\r\nthermo-dynamics. His death, while still occupying the chair of\r\nengineering at the University of Glasgow, December 24, 1872, at the\r\nearly age of fifty-two, was one of the greatest losses to science and\r\nto the profession which have occurred during the century.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCHAPTER VIII.\r\n\r\n_THE PHILOSOPHY OF THE STEAM-ENGINE._\r\n\r\nITS APPLICATION; ITS TEACHINGS RESPECTING THE CONSTRUCTION OF THE\r\nENGINE AND ITS IMPROVEMENT.\r\n\r\n  \"Oftentimes an Uncertaintie hindered our going on so merrily, but by\r\n  persevering the Difficultie was mastered, and the new Triumph gave\r\n  stronger Heart unto us.\"--RALEIGH.\r\n\r\n  \"If everything which we cannot comprehend is to be called an\r\n  impossibility, how many are daily presented to our eyes! and in\r\n  contemning as false that which we consider to be impossible, may we\r\n  not be depreciating a giant's effort to give an importance to our\r\n  own weakness?\"--MONTAIGNE.\r\n\r\n  \"They who aim vigorously at perfection will come nearer to it than\r\n  those whose laziness or despondency makes them give up its pursuit\r\n  from the feeling of its being unattainable.\"--CHESTERFIELD.\r\n\r\n\r\nAs has been already stated, the steam-engine is a machine which is\r\nespecially designed to transform energy, originally dormant or\r\npotential, into active and usefully available kinetic energy.\r\n\r\nWhen, millions of years ago, in that early period which the geologists\r\ncall the carboniferous, the kinetic energy of the sun's rays, and of\r\nthe glowing interior of the earth, was expended in the decomposition\r\nof the vast volumes of carbonic acid with which air was then charged,\r\nand in the production of a life-sustaining atmosphere and of the\r\nimmense forests which then covered the earth with their almost\r\ninconceivably luxuriant vegetation, there was stored up for the\r\nbenefit of the human race, then uncreated, an inconceivably great\r\ntreasure of potential energy, which we are now just beginning to\r\nutilize. This potential energy becomes kinetic and available wherever\r\nand whenever the powerful chemical affinity of oxygen for carbon is\r\npermitted to come into play; and the fossil fuel stored in our\r\ncoal-beds or the wood of existing forests is, by the familiar process\r\nof combustion, permitted to return to the state of combination with\r\noxygen in which it existed in the earliest geological periods.\r\n\r\nThe philosophy of the steam-engine, therefore, traces the changes\r\nwhich occur from this first step, by which, in the furnace of the\r\nsteam-boiler, this potential energy which exists in the tendency of\r\ncarbon and oxygen to combine to form carbonic acid is taken advantage\r\nof, and the utilizable kinetic energy of heat is produced in\r\nequivalent amount, to the final application of resulting mechanical\r\nenergy to machinery of transmission, through which it is usefully\r\napplied to the elevation of water, to the driving of mills and\r\nmachinery of all kinds, or to the hauling of \"lightning\" trains on our\r\nrailways, or to the propulsion of the Great Eastern.\r\n\r\nThe kinetic heat-energy developed in the furnace of the steam-boiler\r\nis partly transmitted through the metallic walls which inclose the\r\nsteam and water within the boiler, there to evaporate water, and to\r\nassume that form of energy which exists in steam confined under\r\npressure, and is partly carried away into the atmosphere in the\r\ndischarged gaseous products of combustion, serving, however, a useful\r\npurpose, _en route_, by producing the draught needed to keep up\r\ncombustion.\r\n\r\nThe steam, with its store of heat-energy, passes through tortuous\r\npipes and passages to the steam-cylinder of the engine, losing more or\r\nless heat on the way, and there expands, driving the piston before it,\r\nand losing heat by the transformation of that form of energy while\r\ndoing mechanical work of equivalent amount. But this steam-cylinder is\r\nmade of metal, a material which is one of the best conductors of heat,\r\nand therefore one of the very worst possible substances with which to\r\ninclose anything as subtile and difficult of control as the heat\r\npervading a condensible vapor like steam. The process of internal\r\ncondensation and reevaporation, which is the great enemy of economical\r\nworking, thus has full play, and is only partly checked by the heat\r\nfrom the steam-jacket, which, penetrating the cylinder, assists by\r\nkeeping up the temperature of the internal surface and checking the\r\nfirst step, condensation, which is an essential preliminary to the\r\nfinal waste by reevaporation. The piston, too, is of metal, and\r\naffords a most excellent way of exit for the heat escaping to the\r\nexhaust side.\r\n\r\nFinally, all unutilized heat rejected from the steam-cylinder is\r\ncarried away from the machine, either by the water of condensation,\r\nor, in the non-condensing engine, by the atmosphere into which it is\r\ndischarged.\r\n\r\nHaving traced the method of operation of the steam-engine, it is easy\r\nto discover what principles are comprehended in its philosophy, to\r\nlearn what are known facts bearing upon its operation, and to\r\ndetermine what are the directions in which improvement must take\r\nplace, what are the limits beyond which improvement cannot possibly be\r\ncarried, and, in some directions, to determine what is the proper\r\ncourse to pursue in effecting improvements. The general direction of\r\nchange in the past, as well as at present, is easily seen, and it may\r\nusually be assumed that there will be no immediate change of direction\r\nin a course which has long been preserved, and which is well defined.\r\nWe may, therefore, form an idea of the probable direction in which to\r\nlook for improvement in the near future.\r\n\r\nReviewing the operations which go on in this machine during the\r\nprocess of transformation of energy which has been outlined, and\r\nstudying it more in detail, we may deduce the principles which govern\r\nits design and construction, guide us in its management, and determine\r\nits efficiency.\r\n\r\nIn the furnace of the boiler, the quantity of heat developed in\r\navailable form is proportional to the amount of fuel burned. It is\r\navailable in proportion to the temperature attained by the products of\r\ncombustion; were this temperature no higher than that of the boiler,\r\nthe heat would all pass off unutilized. But the temperature produced\r\nby a given quantity of heat, measured in heat-units, is greater as the\r\nvolume of gas heated is less. It follows that, at this point,\r\ntherefore, the fuel should be perfectly consumed with the least\r\npossible air-supply, and the least possible abstraction of heat before\r\ncombustion is complete. High temperature of furnace, also, favors\r\ncomplete combustion. We hence conclude that, in the steam-boiler\r\nfurnace, fuel should be burned completely in a chamber having\r\nnon-conducting walls, and with the smallest air-supply compatible with\r\nthorough combustion; and, further, that the air should be free from\r\nmoisture, that greatest of all absorbents of heat, and that the\r\nproducts of combustion should be removed from the furnace before\r\nbeginning to drain their heat into the boiler. A fire-brick furnace, a\r\nlarge combustion-chamber with thorough intermixture of gases within\r\nit, good fuel, and a restricted and carefully-distributed supply of\r\nair, seem to be the conditions which meet these requisites best.\r\n\r\nThe heat generated by combustion traverses the walls which separate\r\nthe gases of the furnace from the steam and water confined within the\r\nboiler, and is then taken up by those fluids, raising their\r\ntemperature from that of the entering \"feed-water\" to that due the\r\nsteam-pressure, and expanding the liquid into steam occupying a\r\ngreatly-increased volume, thus doing a certain amount of work, besides\r\nincreasing temperature. The extent to which heat may thus be usefully\r\nwithdrawn from the furnace-gases depends upon the conductivity of the\r\nmetallic wall, the rate at which the water will take heat from the\r\nmetal, and the difference of temperature on the two sides of the\r\nmetal. Extended \"heating-surface,\" therefore, a metal of high\r\nconducting power, and a maximum difference of temperature on the two\r\nsides of the separating wall of metal, are the essential conditions of\r\neconomy here. The heating-surface is sometimes made of so great an\r\narea that the temperature of the escaping gases is too low to give\r\ngood chimney-draught, and a \"mechanical draught\" is resorted to,\r\nrevolving \"fan-blowers\" being ordinarily used for its production. It\r\nis most economical to adopt this method. The steam-boiler is generally\r\nconstructed of iron--sometimes, but rarely, of cast-iron, although\r\n\"steel,\" where not hard enough to harden or temper, is better in\r\nconsequence of its greater strength and homogeneousness of structure,\r\nand its better conductivity. The maximum conductivity of flow of heat\r\nfor any given material is secured by so designing the boiler as to\r\nsecure rapid, steady, and complete circulation of the water within it.\r\nThe maximum rapidity of transfer throughout the whole area of\r\nheating-surface is secured, usually, by taking the feed-water into the\r\nboiler as nearly as possible at the point where the gases are\r\ndischarged into the chimney-flue, withdrawing the steam nearer the\r\npoint of maximum temperature of flues, and securing opposite\r\ndirections of flow for the gases on the one side and the water on the\r\nother. Losses of heat from the boiler, by conduction and radiation to\r\nsurrounding bodies, are checked as far as possible by non-conducting\r\ncoverings.\r\n\r\nThe mechanical equivalent of the heat generated in the boiler is\r\neasily calculated when the conditions of working are known. A pound of\r\npure carbon has been found to be capable of liberating by its perfect\r\ncombustion, resulting in the formation of carbonic acid, 14,500\r\nBritish thermal units, equivalent to 14,500 x 772 = 11,194,000\r\nfoot-pounds of work, and, if burned in one hour, to 11194000/1980000 =\r\n5.6 horse-power. In other words, with perfect utilization, but 10/56 =\r\n0.177, or about one-sixth, of a pound of carbon would be needed per\r\nhour for each horse-power of work done. But even good coal is not\r\nnearly all carbon, and has but about nine-tenths this heat-producing\r\npower, and it is usually rated as yielding about 10,000,000\r\nfoot-pounds of work per pound. The evaporative power of pure carbon\r\nbeing rated at 15 pounds of water, that of good coal may be stated at\r\n13-1/2. In metric measures, one gramme of good coal should evaporate\r\nabout 13-1/2 grammes of water from the boiling-point, producing the\r\nequivalent of about 3,000,000 kilogrammetres of work from the 7,272\r\n_calories_ of heat thus generated. A gramme of pure carbon generates\r\nin its combustion 8,080 _calories_ of heat. Per hour and per\r\nhorse-power, 0.08, or less than one-twelfth, of a kilogram of carbon\r\nburned per hour evolves heat-energy equal to one horse-power.\r\n\r\nOf the coal burned in a steam-boiler, it rarely happens that more than\r\nthree-fourths is utilized in making steam; 7,500,000 foot-pounds\r\n(1,036,898 kilogrammetres) is, therefore, as much energy as is usually\r\nsent to the engine per pound of good coal burned in the steam-boiler.\r\nThe \"efficiency\" of a good steam-boiler is therefore usually not far\r\nfrom 0.75 as a maximum. Rankine estimates this quantity for ordinary\r\nboilers of good design and with chimney-draught at\r\n\r\n          0.92\r\n  E = ------------;\r\n      1 + 0.5(F/S)\r\n\r\nin which F/S is the ratio of weight of fuel burned per square foot of\r\ngrate to the ratio of heating to grate surface; this is a formula of\r\nfairly close approximation for general practice.\r\n\r\nThe steam in the engine first drives the piston some distance before\r\nthe induction or steam valve is closed, and it then expands, doing\r\nwork, and condensing in proportion to work done as the expansion\r\nproceeds, until it is finally released by the opening of the exhaust\r\nor eduction valve. Saturated steam is modified in its action by a\r\nprocess which has already been described, condensing at the beginning\r\nand reevaporating at the end of the stroke, thus carrying into the\r\ncondenser considerable quantities of heat which should have been\r\nutilized in the development of power. Whether this operation takes\r\nplace in one cylinder or in several is only of importance in so far as\r\nit modifies the losses due to conduction and radiation of heat, to\r\ncondensation and reevaporation of steam, and to the friction of the\r\nmachine. It has already been seen how these losses are modified by the\r\nsubstitution of the compound for the single-cylinder engine.\r\n\r\nThe laws of thermo-dynamics teach, as has been stated, that the\r\nproportion of the heat-energy contained in the steam or other working\r\nfluid which may be transformed into mechanical energy is a fraction\r\n(H_{1} - H_{2})/H_{1}, of the total, in which H_{1} and H_{2} are the\r\nquantities of heat contained in the steam at the beginning and at the\r\nend of its operation, measuring from the absolute zero of heat-motion.\r\nIn perfect gases,\r\n\r\n  H_{1} - H_{2}   [tau]_{1} - [tau]_{2}      T_{1} - T_{2}\r\n  ------------- = --------------------- = --------------------\r\n      H_{1}             [tau]_{1}         T_{1} + 461.2 deg. Fahr.\r\n\r\nbut in imperfect gases, and especially in vapors which, like steam,\r\ncondense, or otherwise change their physical state, this equality may\r\nstill exist,\r\n\r\n  (H_{1} - H_{2})/H_{1} = ([tau]_{1} - [tau]_{2})/[tau]_{1};\r\n\r\nand the fluid is equally efficient with the\r\nperfect gas as a working substance in a heat-engine. In any case it is\r\nseen that the efficiency is greatest when the whole of the heat is\r\nreceived at the maximum and rejected at the minimum attainable\r\ntemperatures.\r\n\r\nAssuming this expression strictly accurate, a hot-air engine working\r\nfrom 413.6 deg. Fahr, or 874.8 deg. absolute temperature, down to 122 deg. Fahr,\r\nor 583.2 deg. absolute, should have an efficiency of 0.263, transforming\r\nthat proportion of available heat into mechanical work. The engines\r\nof the steamer Ericsson closely approached this figure, and gave a\r\nhorse-power for each 1.87 pound of coal burned per hour.\r\n\r\nSteam expands in the steam-cylinder quite differently under different\r\ncircumstances. If no heat is either communicated to it or abstracted\r\nfrom it, however, it expands in an hyperbolic curve, losing its\r\ntension much more rapidly than when expanded without doing work, in\r\nconsequence both of its change of volume and its condensation. The\r\nalgebraic expression for this method of expansion is, according to\r\nRankine, PV^{1.111} = C, a constant, or, according to other\r\nauthorities, from PV^{1.135} = C to PV^{1.140} = C. The greater the\r\nvalue of the exponent of V, the greater the efficiency of the fluid\r\nbetween any two temperatures. The maximum value has been found to be\r\ngiven where the steam is saturated, but perfectly dry, at the\r\ncommencement of its expansion. The loss due to condensation on the\r\ncooled interior surface of the cylinder at the commencement of the\r\nstroke and the subsequent reevaporation as expansion progresses is\r\nleast when the cylinder is kept hot by its steam-jacket and when least\r\ntime is given during the stroke for this transfer of heat between the\r\nmetal and the vapor.\r\n\r\nIt may be said that, all things considered, therefore, losses of heat\r\nin the steam-cylinder are least when the steam enters dry, or\r\nmoderately superheated, where the interior surfaces are kept hottest\r\nby the steam-jacket or by the hot-air jacket sometimes used, and where\r\npiston-speed and velocity of rotation are highest.[115] The best of\r\ncompound engines, using steam of seventy-five pounds pressure and\r\ncondensing, usually require about two pounds of coal per\r\nhour--20,000,000 foot-pounds of energy at the furnace--to develop a\r\nhorse-power, i. e., about ten times the heat-equivalent of the\r\nmechanical work which they accomplish. Were the steam to expand like\r\nthe permanent gases, they would have a theoretical efficiency of about\r\none-quarter; actually, the efficiency is only one-tenth. The\r\nsteam-engine, therefore, utilizes about two-fifths the heat-energy\r\ntheoretically available with the best type of engine in general use.\r\nBy far the greater part, nearly all, in fact, of the nine-tenths\r\nwasted is rejected in the exhaust steam, and can only be saved by some\r\nsuch method as is hereafter to be suggested of retaining that heat and\r\nreturning it to the boiler.\r\n\r\n  [115] In some cases, as in the Allen engine, the speed of piston has\r\n  become very high, approaching 800((stroke)^{1/3}).\r\n\r\nThe mechanical power which has now been communicated to the mechanism\r\nof the engine by the transfer of the kinetic energy of the hot steam\r\nto the piston is finally usefully applied to whatever \"mechanism of\r\ntransmission\" forms the connection with the machinery driven by the\r\nengine. In this transfer, there is some loss in the engine itself, by\r\nfriction. This is an extremely variable amount, and it can be made\r\nvery small by skillful design and good workmanship and management. It\r\nmay be taken at one-half pound per square inch of piston for good\r\nengines of 100 horse-power and upward, but is often several pounds in\r\nvery small engines. It is least when the rubbing surfaces are of\r\ndifferent materials, but both of smooth, hard, close-grained metal,\r\nwell lubricated, and where advantage is taken of any arrangement of\r\nparts which permits the equilibration of pressure, as on the\r\nshaft-bearings of double and triple engines. The friction of a\r\nsteam-engine of large size and good design is usually between five and\r\nseven per cent. of its total power. It increases rapidly as the size\r\nof engine decreases.\r\n\r\nHaving now traced somewhat minutely the growth of the steam-engine\r\nfrom the beginning of the Christian era to the present time, having\r\nrapidly outlined the equally gradual, though intermittent, growth of\r\nits philosophy, and having shown how the principles of science find\r\napplication in the operation of this wonderful machine, we are now\r\nprepared to study the conditions which control the intelligent\r\ndesigner, and to endeavor to learn what are the lessons taught us by\r\nscience and by experience in regard to the essential requisites of\r\nefficient working of steam and economy in the consumption of fuel. We\r\nmay even venture to point out definitely the direction in which\r\nimprovement is now progressing as indicated by a study of these\r\nrequisites, and may be able to perceive the natural limits to such\r\nprogress, and possibly to conjecture what must be the character of\r\nthat change of type which only can take the engineer beyond the limit\r\nset to his advance so long as he is confined to the construction of\r\nthe present type of engine.\r\n\r\nFirst, we must consider the question: _What is the problem, stated\r\nprecisely and in its most general form, that engineers have been here\r\nattempting to solve?_\r\n\r\nAfter stating the problem, we will examine the record with a view to\r\ndetermine what direction the path of improvement has taken hitherto,\r\nto learn what are the conditions of efficiency which should govern the\r\nconstruction of the modern steam-engine, and, so far as we may judge\r\nthe future by the past, by inference, to ascertain what appears to be\r\nthe proper course for the present and for the immediate future. Still\r\nfurther, we will inquire, what are the conditions, physical and\r\nintellectual, which best aid our progress in perfecting the\r\nsteam-engine.\r\n\r\nThis most important problem may be stated in its most general, yet\r\ndefinite, form as follows:\r\n\r\n_To construct a machine which shall, in the most perfect manner\r\npossible, convert the kinetic energy of heat into mechanical power,\r\nthe heat being derived from the combustion of fuel, and steam being\r\nthe receiver and the conveyer of that heat._\r\n\r\nThe problem, as we have already seen, embodies two distinct and\r\nequally important inquiries:\r\n\r\nThe first: What are the scientific principles involved in the problem\r\nas stated?\r\n\r\nThe second: How shall a machine be constructed that shall most\r\nefficiently embody, and accord with, not only those scientific\r\nprinciples, but also all of those principles of engineering practice\r\nthat so vitally affect the economical value of every machine?\r\n\r\nThe one question is addressed to the man of science, the other to the\r\nengineer. They can be satisfactorily answered, even so far as our\r\nknowledge at present permits, after studying with care the scientific\r\nprinciples involved in the theory of the steam-engine under the best\r\nlight that science can afford us, and by a careful study of the\r\nvarious steps of improvement that have taken place and of accompanying\r\nvariations of structure, analyzing the effect of each change, and\r\ntracing the reasons for them.\r\n\r\nThe theory of the steam-engine is too important and too extensive a\r\nsubject to be satisfactorily treated here in even the most concise\r\npossible manner. I can only attempt a plain statement of the course\r\nwhich seems to be pointed out by science as the proper one to pursue\r\nin the endeavor to increase the economical efficiency of\r\nsteam-engines.\r\n\r\nThe teachings of science indicate that _success in economically\r\nderiving mechanical power from the energy of heat-motion will, in all\r\ncases, be the greater as we work between more widely separated limits\r\nof temperature, and as we more perfectly provide against losses by\r\ndissipation of heat in directions in which it is unavailable for the\r\nproduction of power_.\r\n\r\nScientific research, as we have seen, has proved that, in all known\r\nvarieties of heat-engine, a large loss of effect is unavoidable from\r\nthe fact that we cannot, in the ordinary steam-engine, reduce the\r\nlower limit of temperature, in working, below a point which is far\r\nabove the absolute zero of temperature--far above that point at which\r\nbodies have no heat-motion. The point corresponding to the mean\r\ntemperature of the surface of the earth is above the ordinary lower\r\nlimit.\r\n\r\nThe higher the temperature of the steam when it enters the steam\r\ncylinder, and the lower that which it reaches before the exhaust\r\noccurs, the greater, science tells us, will be our success, provided\r\nwe at the same time avoid waste of heat and power.\r\n\r\nNow, looking back over the history of the steam-engine, we may briefly\r\nnote the prominent improvements and the most striking changes of form,\r\nand may thus endeavor to obtain some idea of the general direction in\r\nwhich we are to look for further advance.\r\n\r\nBeginning with the machine of Porta, at which point we may first take\r\nup an unbroken thread, it will be remembered that we there found a\r\nsingle vessel performing the functions of all the parts of a modern\r\npumping-engine; it was, at once, boiler, steam-cylinder, and\r\ncondenser, as well as both a lifting and a forcing pump.\r\n\r\nThe Marquis of Worcester divided the engine into two parts, using a\r\nseparate boiler.\r\n\r\nSavery duplicated that part of the engine of Worcester which performed\r\nthe several parts of pump, steam-cylinder, and condenser, and added\r\nthe use of water to effect rapid condensation, perfecting, so far as\r\nit was ever perfected, the steam-engine as a simple machine.\r\n\r\nNewcomen and Calley next separated the pump from the steam-engine\r\nproper, producing the modern steam-engine--the engine as a train of\r\nmechanism; and in their engine, as in Savery's, we noticed the use of\r\nsurface condensation first, and subsequently that of the jet thrown\r\ninto the midst of the steam to be condensed.\r\n\r\nWatt finally effected the crowning improvements, and completed the\r\nmovement oL \"differentiation\" by separating the condenser from the\r\nsteam-cylinder. Here this process of change ceased, the several\r\nimportant operations of the steam-engine now being conducted each in a\r\nseparate vessel. The boiler furnished the steam, the cylinder derived\r\nfrom it mechanical power, and it was finally condensed in a separate\r\nvessel, while the power which had been obtained from it in the\r\nsteam-cylinder was transmitted through still other parts, to the\r\npumps, or wherever work was to be done.\r\n\r\nWatt, also, took the initiative in another direction. He continually\r\nincreased the efficiency of the machine by improving the proportions\r\nof its parts and the character of its workmanship, thus making it\r\npossible to render available many of those improvements in detail upon\r\nwhich effectiveness is so greatly dependent and which are only useful\r\nwhen made by a skillful workman.\r\n\r\nWatt and his contemporaries also commenced that movement toward higher\r\npressures of steam and greater expansion which has been the most\r\nstriking feature noticed in the progress of steam-engineering since\r\nhis time. Newcomen used steam of barely more than atmospheric pressure\r\nand raised 105,000 pounds of water one foot high with a pound of coal\r\nconsumed. Smeaton raised the pressure somewhat and increased the duty\r\nconsiderably. Watt started with a duty double that of Newcomen and\r\nraised it to 320,000 foot-pounds per pound of coal, with steam at 10\r\npounds pressure. To-day, Cornish engines of the same general plan as\r\nthose of Watt, but worked with 40 to 60 pounds of steam and expanding\r\nthree or four times, do a duty probably averaging, with the better\r\nclass of engines, 600,000 foot-pounds per pound of coal. The compound\r\npumping-engine runs the figure up to above 1,000,000.\r\n\r\nThe increase in steam-pressure and in expansion since Watt's time has\r\nbeen accompanied by a very great improvement in workmanship--a\r\nconsequence, very largely, of the rapid increase in perfection, and in\r\nthe wide range of adaptation of machine-tools--by higher skill and\r\nintelligence in designing engines and boilers, by increased\r\npiston-speed, greater care in obtaining dry steam, and in keeping it\r\ndry until thrown out of the cylinder, either by steam-jacketing or by\r\nsuperheating, or both combined; it has further been accompanied by a\r\ngreater attention to the important matter of providing carefully\r\nagainst losses by radiation and conduction of heat. We use, finally,\r\nthe compound or double-cylinder engine for the purpose of saving some\r\nof the heat usually lost in internal condensation and reevaporation,\r\nand precipitation of condensed vapor from great expansion.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, although there is a limit, tolerably well defined,\r\nin the scale of temperature, below which we cannot expect to pass, a\r\ndegree gained in approaching this lower limit is more remunerative\r\nthan a degree gained in the range of temperature available by\r\nincreasing temperatures.[116]\r\n\r\n  [116] The fact here referred to is easily seen if it is supposed\r\n  that an engine is supplied with steam at a temperature of 400 deg.\r\n  above absolute zero and works it, without waste, down to a\r\n  temperature of 200 deg.. Suppose one inventor to adapt the engine to the\r\n  use of steam of a range from 500 deg. down to 200 deg., while another works\r\n  his engine, with equally effective provision against losses, between\r\n  the limits of 400 deg. and 100 deg., an equal range with a lower mean. The\r\n  first case gives an efficiency of one-half, the second three-fifths,\r\n  and the third three-fourths, the last giving the highest effect.\r\n\r\nHence the attempt made by the French inventor, Du Trembly, about the\r\nyear 1850, and by other inventors since, to utilize a larger\r\nproportion of heat by approaching more closely the lower limit, was in\r\naccordance with known scientific principles.\r\n\r\nWe may summarize the result of our examination of the growth of the\r\nsteam-engine thus:\r\n\r\n_First._ The process of improvement has been one, primarily, of\r\n\"differentiation;\"[117] the number of parts has been continually\r\nincreased; while the work of each part has been simplified, a separate\r\norgan being appropriated to each process in the cycle of operations.\r\n\r\n  [117] This term, though perhaps not familiar to engineers, expresses\r\n  the idea perfectly.\r\n\r\n_Secondly._ A kind of secondary process of differentiation has, to\r\nsome extent, followed the completion of the primary one, in which\r\nsecondary process one operation is conducted partly in one and partly\r\nin another portion of the machine. This is illustrated by the two\r\ncylinders of the compound engine and by the duplication noticed in the\r\nbinary engine.\r\n\r\n_Thirdly._ The direction of improvement has been marked by a continual\r\nincrease of steam-pressure, greater expansion, provision for obtaining\r\ndry steam, high piston-speed, careful protection against loss of heat\r\nby conduction or radiation, and, in marine engines, by surface\r\ncondensation.\r\n\r\nThe direction which improvement seems now to be taking, and the proper\r\ndirection, as indicated by an examination of the principles of\r\nscience, as well as by our review of the steps already taken, would\r\nseem to be: working between the widest attainable limits of\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nSteam must enter the machine at the highest possible temperature, must\r\nbe protected from waste, and must retain, at the moment before\r\nexhaust, the least possible amount of heat. He whose inventive genius,\r\nor mechanical skill, contributes to effect either the use of higher\r\nsteam with safety and without waste, or the reduction of the\r\ntemperature of discharge, confers a boon upon mankind.\r\n\r\nIn detail: In the engine, the tendency is, and may probably be\r\nexpected to continue, in the near future at least, toward higher\r\nsteam-pressure, greater expansion in more than one cylinder,\r\nsteam-jacketing, superheating, a careful use of non-conducting\r\nprotectors against waste, and the adoption of still higher\r\npiston-speeds.\r\n\r\nIn the boiler: more complete combustion without excess of air passing\r\nthrough the furnace, and more thorough absorption of heat from the\r\nfurnace-gases. The latter will probably be ultimately effected by the\r\nuse of a mechanically produced draught, in place of the far more\r\nwasteful method of obtaining it by the expenditure of heat in the\r\nchimney.\r\n\r\nIn construction we may anticipate the use of better materials, and\r\nmore careful workmanship, especially in the boiler, and much\r\nimprovement in forms and proportions of details.\r\n\r\nIn management, there is a wide field for improvement, which\r\nimprovement we may feel assured will rapidly take place, as it has now\r\nbecome well understood that great care, skill, and intelligence are\r\nimportant essentials to the economical management of the steam-engine,\r\nand that they repay, liberally, all of the expense in time and money\r\nthat is requisite to secure them.\r\n\r\nIn attempting improvements in the directions indicated, it would be\r\nthe height of folly to assume that we have reached a limit in any one\r\nof them, or even that we have approached a limit. If further progress\r\nseems checked by inadequate returns for efforts made, in any case, to\r\nadvance beyond present practice, it becomes the duty of the engineer\r\nto detect the cause of such hinderance, and, having found it, to\r\nremove it.\r\n\r\nA few years ago, the movement toward the expansive working of high\r\nsteam was checked by experiments seeming to prove positive\r\ndisadvantage to follow advance beyond a certain point. A careful\r\nrevision of results, however, showed that this was true only with\r\nengines built, as was then common, in utter disregard of all the\r\nprinciples involved in such a use of steam, and of the precautions\r\nnecessary to be taken to insure the gain which science taught us\r\nshould follow. The hinderances are mechanical, and it is for the\r\nengineer to remove them.\r\n\r\nThe last remark is especially applicable to the work of the engineer\r\nwho is attempting to advance in the direction in which, as already\r\nintimated, an unmistakable revolution is now progressing, the\r\nmodification of the modern steam-engine to adapt it safely and\r\nsuccessfully to run at the high piston-speed, and great velocity of\r\nrotation which have been already attained and which must undoubtedly\r\nbe greatly exceeded in the future. As there is no known and definite\r\nlimit to the economical increase of speed, and as the limit set by\r\npractical conditions is continually being set farther back as the\r\nbuilder acquires greater skill and attains greater accuracy of\r\nworkmanship and the power to insure greater rigidity of parts and\r\ndurability of wearing surfaces, we must anticipate a continued and\r\nindefinite progress in this direction--a progress which must evidently\r\nbe of advantage, whatever may be the direction that other changes may\r\ntake.\r\n\r\nIt is evident that this adaptation of the steam-engine to great speed\r\nof piston is the work now to be done by the engineer. The requisites\r\nto success are obvious, and may be concisely stated as follows:\r\n\r\n1. Extreme accuracy in proportions.\r\n\r\n2. Perfect accuracy in fitting parts to each other.\r\n\r\n3. Absolute symmetry of journals.\r\n\r\n4. Ample area and maximum durability of rubbing surfaces.\r\n\r\n5. Perfect certainty of an ample and continuous lubrication.\r\n\r\n6. A nicely calculated and adjusted balance of reciprocating parts.\r\n\r\n7. Security against injury by shock, whether due to the presence of\r\nwater in the cylinder or to looseness of running parts.\r\n\r\n8. A \"positive-motion\" cut-off gear.\r\n\r\n9. A powerful but sensitive and accurately-working governor\r\ndetermining the degree of expansion.[118]\r\n\r\n  [118] The author is not absolutely confident on the latter point. It\r\n  may be found more economical and satisfactory, ultimately, to\r\n  determine the point of cut-off by an automatic apparatus adjusting\r\n  the expansion-gear _by reference to the steam-pressure_, regulating\r\n  the speed by attaching the governor elsewhere. The author has\r\n  devised several forms of apparatus of the kind referred to.\r\n\r\n10. Well-balanced valves and an easy-working valve-gear.\r\n\r\n11. Small volume of \"dead-space,\" or \"clearance,\" and properly\r\nadjusted \"compression.\"\r\n\r\nIt would seem sufficiently evident that the engine with detachable\r\n(\"drop\") cut-off valve-gear must, sooner or later, become an obsolete\r\ntype, although the substitution of springs or of steam-pressure for\r\ngravity in the closing of the detached valve may defer greatly this\r\napparently inevitable change. The \"engine of the future\" will not\r\nprobably be a \"drop cut-off engine.\"\r\n\r\nAs regards the construction of the engine as a piece of mechanism, the\r\nprinciples and practice of good engineering are precisely the same,\r\nwhether applied in the designing of the compound or of the ordinary\r\ntype of steam-engine. The proportioning of the two machines to each\r\nother in such manner as to form an effective whole, by procuring\r\napproximately equal amounts of work from both, is the only essential\r\npeculiarity of compound-engine design which calls for especial care,\r\nand the method of securing success in practice may be stated to be,\r\nfor both forms of engines, as follows:\r\n\r\n1. A good design, by which is meant--\r\n\r\n_a._ Correct proportions, both in general dimensions and in\r\narrangement of parts, and proper forms and sizes of details to\r\nwithstand safely the forces which may be expected to come upon them.\r\n\r\n_b._ A general plan which embodies the recognized practice of good\r\nengineering.\r\n\r\n_c._ Adaptation to the specific work which it is intended to perform,\r\nin size and in efficiency. It sometimes happens that good practice\r\ndictates the use of a comparatively uneconomical design.\r\n\r\n2. Good construction, by which is meant--\r\n\r\n_a._ The use of good material.\r\n\r\n_b._ Accurate workmanship.\r\n\r\n_c._ Skillful fitting and a proper \"assemblage\" of parts.\r\n\r\n3. Proper connection with its work, that it may do that work under the\r\nconditions assumed in its design.\r\n\r\n4. Skillful management by those in whose hands it is placed.\r\n\r\n_In general_, it may be stated that, to secure maximum economical\r\nefficiency, steam should be worked at as high a pressure as possible,\r\nand the expansion should be fixed as nearly as possible at the point\r\nof maximum economy for that pressure. In general, the number of times\r\nwhich the volume of steam may be expanded in the standard\r\nsingle-cylinder, high-pressure engine with maximum economy, is not far\r\nfrom 1/2 sqrt(P), where P is the pressure in pounds per square inch;\r\nit rarely exceeds 0.75 sqrt(P). This may be exceeded in\r\ndouble-cylinder engines. It is even more disadvantageous to cut off\r\ntoo short than to \"'follow' too far.\" With considerable expansion,\r\nsteam-jacketing and moderate superheating should be adopted, to\r\nprevent excessive losses by internal condensation and reevaporation;\r\nand expansion should take place in double cylinders, to avoid\r\nexcessive weight of parts, irregularity of motion, and great loss by\r\nfriction.\r\n\r\nTo secure this vitally important economy, it is advisable to seek some\r\npracticable method of lining the cylinder with a non-conducting\r\nmaterial. This plan, as has been seen, was adopted by Smeaton, in\r\nconstructing Newcomen engines a century ago. Smeaton used wood on his\r\npistons, and Watt tried wood as a material for steam-cylinder linings.\r\nThat material is too perishable at temperatures now common, and no\r\nmetal has yet been substituted, or even discovered, which answers the\r\nsame purpose. The loss will also be reduced by increasing the speed of\r\nrotation and velocity of piston. Where no effectual means can be found\r\nof preventing contact of the steam with a good absorbent and conductor\r\nof heat, it will be found best to sacrifice some of the efficiency due\r\nto the change of state of the vapor, by superheating it and sending it\r\ninto the cylinder at a temperature considerably exceeding that of\r\nsaturation. With low steam and slowly-moving pistons, it is better to\r\npursue the latter course than to attempt to increase the efficiency of\r\nthe engine by greater expansion.\r\n\r\nExternal surfaces should be carefully covered by non-conductors and\r\nnon-radiators, to prevent losses by conduction and radiation of heat.\r\nIt is especially necessary to reduce back-pressure and to obtain the\r\nmost perfect vacuum possible without overloading the air-pump, if it\r\nis desired to obtain the maximum efficiency by expansion, and it then\r\nbecomes also very necessary to reduce losses by \"dead-spaces\" and by\r\nbadly-adjusted valves.\r\n\r\nThe piston-speed should be as great as can be sustained with safety.\r\n\r\nGood engines should not require more than W = (200/sqrt(P)) where W =\r\nthe weight of steam per hour and per horse-power; the best practice\r\ngives about W = (180/sqrt(P)) in large engines with dry steam, high\r\npiston-speed, and good design, construction, and management.\r\n\r\nThe expansion-valve gear should be simple. The point of cut-off is\r\nperhaps best determined by the governor. The valve should close\r\nrapidly, but without shock, and should be balanced, or some other\r\ndevice should be adopted to make it easy to move and free from\r\nliability to cutting or rapid wear.\r\n\r\nThe governor should act promptly and powerfully, and should be free\r\nfrom liability to oscillate, and to thus introduce irregularities\r\nwhich are sometimes not less serious than those which the instrument\r\nis intended to prevent.\r\n\r\nFriction should be reduced as much as possible, and careful provision\r\nshould be made to economize lubricants as well as fuel.\r\n\r\nThe Principles of Steam-Boiler Construction are exceedingly simple;\r\nand although attempts are almost daily made to obtain improved\r\nresults by varying the design and arrangement of heating-surface, the\r\nbest boilers of nearly all makers of acknowledged standing are\r\npractically equal in merit, although of very diverse forms.\r\n\r\nIn making boilers, the effort of the engineer should evidently be:\r\n\r\n1. To secure complete combustion of the fuel without permitting\r\ndilution of the products of combustion by excess of air.\r\n\r\n2. To secure as high temperature of furnace as possible.\r\n\r\n3. To so arrange heating-surfaces that, without checking draught, the\r\navailable heat shall be most completely taken up and utilized.\r\n\r\n4. To make the form of boiler such that it shall be constructed\r\nwithout mechanical difficulty or excessive expense.\r\n\r\n5. To give it such form that it shall be durable, under the action of\r\nthe hot gases and of the corroding elements of the atmosphere.\r\n\r\n6. To make every part accessible for cleaning and repairs.\r\n\r\n7. To make every part as nearly as possible uniform in strength, and\r\nin liability to loss of strength by wear and tear, so that the boiler\r\nwhen old shall not be rendered useless by local defects.\r\n\r\n8. To adopt a reasonably high \"factor of safety\" in proportioning\r\nparts.\r\n\r\n9. To provide efficient safety-valves, steam-gauges, and other\r\nappurtenances.\r\n\r\n10. To secure intelligent and very careful management.\r\n\r\nIn securing complete combustion, the first of these desiderata, an\r\nample supply of air and its thorough intermixture with the combustible\r\nelements of the fuel are essential; for the second--high temperature\r\nof furnace--it is necessary that the air-supply shall not be in excess\r\nof that absolutely needed to give complete combustion. The efficiency\r\nof a furnace in making heat available is measured by\r\n\r\n       T - T'\r\n  E = -------;\r\n      T - _t_\r\n\r\nin which E represents the ratio of heat utilized to the whole\r\ncalorific value of the fuel, T is the furnace-temperature, T' the\r\ntemperature of the chimney, and _t_ that of the external air. The\r\nhigher the furnace-temperature and the lower that of the chimney, the\r\ngreater the proportion of heat available. It is further evident that,\r\nhowever perfect the combustion, no heat can be utilized if either the\r\ntemperature of the chimney approximates to that of the furnace, or if\r\nthe temperature of the furnace is reduced by dilution approximately to\r\nthat of the boiler. Concentration of heat in the furnace is secured,\r\nin some cases, by special expedients, as by heating the entering air,\r\nor as in the Siemens gas-furnace, heating both the combustible gases\r\nand the supporter of combustion. Detached fire-brick furnaces have an\r\nadvantage over the \"fire-boxes\" of steam-boilers in their higher\r\ntemperature; surrounding the fire with non-conducting and highly\r\nheated surfaces is an effective method of securing high\r\nfurnace-temperature.\r\n\r\nIn arranging heating-surface, the effort should be to impede the\r\ndraught as little as possible, and so to place them that the\r\ncirculation of water within the boiler should be free and rapid at\r\nevery part reached by the hot gases. The directions of circulation of\r\nwater on the one side and of gas on the other side of the sheet\r\nshould, whenever possible, be opposite. The cold water should enter\r\nwhere the cooled gases leave, and the steam should be taken off\r\nfarthest from that point. The temperature of chimney-gases has thus\r\nbeen reduced in practice to less than 300 deg. Fahr., and an efficiency\r\nequal to 0.75 to 0.80 the theoretical has been attained.\r\n\r\nThe extent of heating-surface simply, in all of the best forms of\r\nboiler, determines the efficiency, and in them the disposition of that\r\nsurface seldom affects it to any great extent. The area of\r\nheating-surface may also be varied within very wide limits without\r\nvery greatly modifying efficiency. A ratio of 25 to 1 in flue and 30\r\nto 1 in tubular boilers represents the relative area of heating and\r\ngrate surfaces as chosen in the practice of the best-known builders.\r\n\r\nThe material of the boiler should be tough and ductile iron, or,\r\nbetter, a soft steel containing only sufficient carbon to insure\r\nmelting in the crucible or on the hearth of the melting-furnace, and\r\nso little that no danger may exist of hardening and cracking under the\r\naction of sudden and great changes of temperature.\r\n\r\nWhere iron is used, it is necessary to select a somewhat hard, but\r\nhomogeneous and tough, quality for the fire-box sheets or any part\r\nexposed to flames.\r\n\r\nThe factor of safety is invariably too low in this country, and is\r\nnever too high in Europe. Foreign builders are more careful in this\r\nmatter than our makers in the United States. The boiler should be\r\nbuilt strong enough to bear a pressure at least six times the proposed\r\nworking-pressure; as the boiler grows weak with age, it should be\r\noccasionally tested to a pressure far above the working-pressure,\r\nwhich latter should be reduced gradually to keep within the bounds of\r\nsafety. In the United States, the factor of safety is seldom more than\r\nfour in the new boilers, frequently much less, and even this is\r\nreduced practically to one and a third by the operation of our\r\ninspection-laws.\r\n\r\nThe principles just enunciated are those generally, perhaps\r\nuniversally, accepted principles which are stated in all text-books of\r\nscience and of steam-engineering, and are accepted by both engineers\r\nand men of science.\r\n\r\nThese principles are correct, and the deductions which have been here\r\nformulated are rigidly exact, as applied to all types of heat-engine\r\nin use; and they lead us to the determination, in all cases, of the\r\n\"modulus\" of efficiency of the engine, i. e., to the calculation of\r\nthe ratio of its actual efficiency to that efficiency which it would\r\nhave, were it absolutely free from loss of heat by conduction or\r\nradiation, or other method of loss of heat or waste of power, by\r\nfriction of parts or by shock.\r\n\r\nThe best modern marine compound engines sometimes, as we have seen,\r\nconsume as little as two pounds of coal per horse-power and per hour;\r\nbut this is but about one-tenth the power derivable from the fuel,\r\nwere all its heat thoroughly utilized. This loss may be divided thus:\r\n70 per cent. rejected in exhausted steam; 20 per cent. lost by\r\nconduction and radiation and by faults of mechanism and design; and\r\nonly the 10 per cent. remaining is utilized. Thirty per cent. of the\r\nheat generated in the furnace is usually lost in the chimney, and of\r\nthe remainder, which enters the engine, 20 per cent. at most is all\r\nwhich we can hope to save any portion of by improvements effected in\r\nour best existing type of steam-engine. It has already been shown how\r\nthe engineer can best proceed in attempting this economy.\r\n\r\nThe direction in which further improvement must take place in the\r\nstandard type of engine is plainly that which shall most efficiently\r\ncheck losses by internal condensation and reevaporation by the\r\ntransfer of heat to and from the metal of the steam-cylinder. The\r\ncondensation of steam doing work is evidently not a disadvantage, but,\r\non the contrary, a decided advantage.\r\n\r\nA new type of engine can, if at all, probably only supersede the\r\ncommon form when engineers can employ steam of very high pressure, and\r\nadopt much greater range of expansion than is now usual. Great\r\nvelocity of piston and high speed of rotation are also essential in\r\nthe attempt to make any revolution in steam-engine construction a\r\nsuccess.\r\n\r\nWhen a new form of steam-engine is likely to be introduced, if at all,\r\ncan be scarcely even conjectured. It seems evident that its success is\r\nto be secured, if a revolution is ever to occur, by the adoption of\r\nhigh steam-pressures, of great piston speeds, by care and skill in\r\ndesign, by the use of exceptionally excellent materials of\r\nconstruction, by great perfection of workmanship, and by intelligence\r\nin its management.\r\n\r\nExperiment and experience will probably lead gradually to the general\r\nand safe employment of much higher steam-pressures and very greatly\r\nincreased piston-speeds, and may ultimately reveal and remove all\r\nthose difficulties which must invariably be expected to be met here,\r\nas in all other attempts to effect radical changes, however important\r\nthey may be.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n       *       *       *       *       *\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n_Scientific Publications._\r\n\r\n\r\n=THE HUMAN SPECIES.= By A.

To point out this error, and to claim\r\n  for science-teaching its appropriate methods, was one object of\r\n  writing these essays.\"\r\n\r\n\r\n       _For sale by all booksellers; or sent by mail, post-paid,\r\n                       on receipt of price._\r\n\r\n          New York: D.
