The seventh\r\nchapter appeared as an article in the _Contemporary Review_ for\r\nAugust 1905, and is here reprinted by the courtesy of the Editor to\r\nwhom I render my thanks. The book is the first attempt to deal with\r\nwhat I would call the archæology of cuneiform decipherment, and like\r\nall pioneering work consequently claims the indulgence of the reader.\r\nFor the sake of clearness I have been forced to repeat myself in a\r\nfew instances, more especially in the sixth chapter, but what has\r\nthereby been lost in literary finish will, I hope, be compensated by an\r\nincrease of clearness in the argument.\r\n\r\nIf what I have written serves no other purpose, I shall be content\r\nif it draws attention to the miserably defective state of our\r\narchæological knowledge of Babylonia and Assyria, and to the necessity\r\nof scientific excavations being carried on there similar to those\r\ninaugurated by Mr. Rhind in Egypt. We have abundance of epigraphic\r\nmaterial; it is the more purely archæological material that is still\r\nwanting.\r\n\r\nThe need of it is every year becoming more urgent with the ever-growing\r\nrevelation of the important and far-reaching part played by Babylonian\r\nculture in the ancient East. Excavation is just commencing in Asia\r\nMinor, and there are many indications that it has startling discoveries\r\nand surprises in store for us. Even while my manuscript was in the\r\nprinter’s hands, Professor Winckler has been examining the cuneiform\r\ntablets found by him last spring at Boghaz Keui, on the site of the\r\nold Hittite capital in Cappadocia, and reading in them the records of\r\nthe Hittite kings, Khattu-sil, Sapaluliuma, Mur-sila and Muttallu.\r\nMost of the tablets, though written in cuneiform characters, are in\r\nthe native language of the country, but among them is a version in\r\nthe Babylonian language of the treaty between the “great king of the\r\nHittites” and Riya-masesa Mai or Ramses II., the Egyptian copy of which\r\nhas long been known to us. The two Arzawan letters in the Tel el-Amarna\r\ncollection no longer stand alone; the Boghaz Keui tablets show that\r\nan active correspondence was carried on between Egypt and Cappadocia.\r\nWe must revise our old ideas about an absence of intercourse between\r\ndifferent parts of the ancient Oriental world: there was quite as much\r\nintercommunication as there is to-day. Elam and Babylonia, Assyria\r\nand Asia Minor, Palestine and Egypt, all were linked together by the\r\nties of a common culture; there were no exclusive religions to raise\r\nbarriers between nation and nation, and the pottery of the Hittites\r\nwas not only carried to the south of Canaan, but the civilization of\r\nBabylonia made its way through Hittite lands to the shores and islands\r\nof Greece. On the south, the Ægean became a highway from Asia Minor to\r\nEurope, while northward the Troad formed a bridge which carried the\r\nculture of Cappadocia to the Balkans and the Danube.\r\n\r\n                                                        A.

There was no Rosetta stone to\r\noffer a clue to their meaning; the very names of the Assyrian kings\r\nand of the gods they worshipped had been lost and forgotten; and the\r\ncharacters themselves were but conventional groups of wedges, not\r\npictures of objects and ideas like the hieroglyphs of Egypt. The\r\ndecipherment started with the guess of a classical scholar who knew no\r\nOriental languages and had never travelled in the East. And yet it is\r\nupon this guess that the vast superstructure of cuneiform decipherment\r\nhas been slowly reared, with its ever-increasing mass of literature\r\nin numerous languages, the very existence of some of which had been\r\npreviously unknown, and with its revelation of a civilized world that\r\nhad faded out of sight before Greek history began. The ancient East\r\nhas risen, as it were, from the dead, with its politics and its wars,\r\nits law and its trade, its art, its industries and its science. And\r\nthis revelation of a new world, this resurrection of a dead past,\r\nhas started from a successful guess. But the guess had been made in\r\naccordance with scientific method and had scientific reasons behind it,\r\nand it has proved to be the fruitful seed of an overspreading tree.\r\n\r\nSeventy years ago a single small case was sufficient to hold all the\r\nAssyrian and Babylonian antiquities possessed by the British Museum.\r\nThey had been collected by Rich, to whom we owe the first accurate\r\nplans of the sites of Babylon and Nineveh. But the cuneiform characters\r\nfound on the seals and clay cylinders of Babylonia were not the only\r\ncharacters of the kind that were known. Similar characters had been\r\nnoticed by travellers on the walls of the ruined palaces of Persepolis\r\nin Persia. As far back as 1621 the Italian traveller Pietro della\r\nValle had copied two or three of these, which he reproduced in the\r\naccount of his travels some thirty years later. One of the first acts\r\nof the newly-founded Royal Society of Great Britain was to ask in their\r\n_Philosophical Transactions_ (p. 420) whether some draughtsman\r\ncould not be found to copy the bas-reliefs and inscriptions which\r\nhad thus been observed at Persepolis, though the only result of the\r\ninquiry was that a few years afterwards (in June 1693) two lines of\r\ncuneiform were published in the _Transactions_ from the papers of\r\na Mr. Samuel Flower, who had been the agent of the East India Company\r\nin Persia. The editor of the _Transactions_ correctly concluded\r\nthat the inscriptions were to be read from left to right. The cuneiform\r\ncharacters which were printed in the _Transactions_ were, however,\r\nnot the first specimens of cuneiform script that had been published in\r\nEngland. Thomas Herbert, in the fourth edition of his Travels, which\r\nappeared in 1677, had already given three lines of characters taken\r\nindifferently from the three classes of inscriptions engraved on the\r\nPersian monuments; these were afterwards annexed by an Italian named\r\nCareri, who published them as his own. But the earliest inscription to\r\nbe reproduced in full was a short one inscribed by Darius I. over the\r\nwindows of his palace, which had been copied by Sir John Chardin during\r\none of his two visits to Persepolis (in 1665 and 1673). Chardin was\r\nthe son of a Huguenot jeweller in Paris, and after returning from his\r\ntravels settled in London, where he became a great favourite of Charles\r\nII., and was made a Fellow of the Royal Society. The inscription he had\r\ncopied, however, was not printed in the earlier edition of his Travels,\r\nand had to wait until 1735 before it saw the light.[1]\r\n\r\nThe existence of the cuneiform script thus became known in Europe,\r\nand that was all. It was not until Carsten Niebuhr, the father of the\r\nbetter-known historian, had been sent by the Danish Government on\r\nan exploring mission to the East that fairly complete and accurate\r\ncopies of the inscriptions of Persepolis were at last put into the\r\nhands of European scholars. Niebuhr, who sacrificed his sight to the\r\nwork, returned to Denmark in 1767, and seven years later the first\r\nof the three volumes in which the scientific results of his travels\r\nwere embodied was published at Copenhagen. With the publication of the\r\nsecond volume, which contained his description of the Persepolitan\r\nmonuments, the attempt to decipher the cuneiform characters began. He\r\nhimself had noticed that in the first of the three classes or systems\r\nof cuneiform writing of which every inscription consisted, only\r\nforty-two characters were employed, and he therefore concluded that the\r\nsystem was alphabetic. Another Dane, Bishop Münter, discovered that the\r\nwords in it were divided from one another by an oblique wedge,[2] and\r\nfurther showed that the monuments must belong to the age of Cyrus and\r\nhis successors.[3] One word, which occurs without any variation towards\r\nthe beginning of each inscription, he correctly inferred to signify\r\n“king”; but beyond this he was unable to advance.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile, Anquetil-Duperron, with self-sacrificing enthusiasm, had\r\nrediscovered the Zend of the later Zoroastrian faith, and de Sacy, with\r\nthe help of it, had deciphered the Pehlevi inscriptions of the Sassanid\r\nkings. It was only the older Persian of the Achæmenian cuneiform\r\ninscriptions that still awaited interpretation; and a bridge had been\r\nbuilt between it and modern Persian by means of the Zendic texts. In\r\n1802 the guess was made which opened the way to the decipherment of the\r\nmysterious wedge-shaped signs. The inspired genius was Grotefend, an\r\naccomplished Latinist and a school-master at Frankfort-on-the-Main.\r\nHe knew no Oriental languages, but his mother-wit and common-sense\r\nmore than made up for the deficiency. It was clear to him that the\r\nthree systems of cuneiform represented three different languages,\r\nthe Persian kings being like a Turkish pasha of to-day, who, when he\r\nwishes an edict to be understood, writes it in Turkish and Arabic. It\r\nwas also clear to him that the first system must be the script of the\r\nPersian kings themselves, of which the other two were translations. The\r\npreparatory work for reading this had already been done by Münter; what\r\nGrotefend now had to do was to identify and read the names to which the\r\nword for “king” was attached.\r\n\r\nOn comparing the inscriptions together he found that while the word\r\nfor “king” remained unchanged, the word which accompanied it at the\r\nbeginning of an inscription varied on different monuments. There were,\r\nin fact, two wholly different words, one of which was peculiar to one\r\nset of monuments, the other to another set. But he also found that the\r\nfirst of these words followed the other on the second set of monuments,\r\nthough with a different termination from that which belonged to it when\r\nit took the place of the first word. Hence he conjectured that the two\r\nwords represented the names of two Persian kings, one of whom was the\r\nson of the other, the termination of the second name when it followed\r\nthe first being that of the genitive. It was now necessary to discover\r\nwho the kings were whose names had thus been found. Fortunately the\r\nAchæmenian dynasty was not a long one, and the number of royal names\r\nin it was not large. And of these names, Cyrus was too short and\r\nArtaxerxes too long for either of the two names which Grotefend had\r\ndetected. There only remained Darius and Xerxes, and as Xerxes was the\r\nson of Darius, the name which characterized the first set of monuments\r\nmust be Darius.\r\n\r\nGrotefend’s next task was to ascertain the old Persian pronunciation of\r\nthe name of Darius. This had been given by Strabo, while the Persian\r\npronunciation of Xerxes was indicated in the Old Testament. With this\r\nassistance Grotefend was able to assign alphabetic values to the\r\ncuneiform characters which composed the two names, and a corner of the\r\nveil which had so long covered the cuneiform records was lifted at\r\nlast. A comparison of the names which he had thus read gave the needful\r\nverification of the correctness of his method. In the names of Darius\r\nand Xerxes the same letters occur, but in different places; _a_ and _r_\r\nin _Darius_ occupy the second and third places, in _Xerxes_ the fourth\r\nand fifth, while _sh_, which is the last letter in _Darius_, would\r\nbe the second and sixth in _Xerxes_. And such was actually the case.\r\nGrotefend was therefore justified in concluding that his guesses were\r\ncorrect, and that the right values had been assigned to the cuneiform\r\ncharacters. A beginning had been made in cuneiform decipherment, and in\r\nthis instance the beginning was half the whole.\r\n\r\nGrotefend’s Memoir was presented to the Göttingen Academy on September\r\n4, 1802. By a curious accident it was at the same meeting that Heyne\r\ndescribed the first attempts that had been made towards deciphering\r\nthe Egyptian hieroglyphs. But the learned world looked askance at the\r\ndiscoveries of the young Latinist. The science of archæology was still\r\nunborn, and Oriental philologists were unable even to understand the\r\ninductive method of the decipherer. The Academy of Göttingen refused to\r\nprint his communications, and it was not until 1815 that they appeared\r\nin the first volume of the History of his friend Heeren, who, being\r\nuntrammelled by the prejudices of Oriental learning, had been one of\r\nthe earliest to accept his conclusions.[4] For a whole generation the\r\nwork of decipherment was allowed to sleep.\r\n\r\nIt is unfortunately true that after his initial success Grotefend’s\r\nignorance of Oriental languages really did stand in his way. He\r\nassumed that the language of the inscriptions and that of the\r\n_Zend-Avesta_ were one and the same, and accordingly went to the\r\nnewly-found Zend dictionary for the readings of the cuneiform names\r\nand words. Vishtaspa, the name of the father of Darius, was thus\r\nread Goshtasp, the word for “king” became _khsheh_ instead of\r\n_khshayathiya_, and that which Grotefend had correctly divined\r\nto signify “great,” _eghre_ instead of _vazraka_. It is not\r\nwonderful, therefore, that he was never able to follow up the beginning\r\nhe had made.\r\n\r\nTo do this was reserved for the Zendic scholars of a later generation.\r\nRask the Dane in 1826 determined the true form of the genitive plural,\r\nand thereby identified the character for _m_ which gave him the\r\nnames of the supreme god Auramazda and of Achæmenes the forefather of\r\nCyrus.[5] But the great step forward was made by the eminent French\r\nscholar, Emile Burnouf, in 1836.[6] The first of the inscriptions\r\npublished by Niebuhr he discovered to contain a list of the satrapies\r\nof Darius. With this clue in his hand the reading of the names and the\r\nsubsequent identification of the letters which composed them could\r\nbe a question only of patience and time. For this Burnouf was well\r\nequipped by his philological knowledge and training, and the result\r\nwas an alphabet of thirty letters, the greater part of which had been\r\ncorrectly deciphered.\r\n\r\nBurnouf’s Memoir on the subject was published in June 1836. In the\r\npreceding month his friend and pupil, Professor Lassen of Bonn, had\r\nalso published a work on “The Old Persian Cuneiform Inscriptions of\r\nPersepolis.”[7] He and Burnouf had been in frequent correspondence, and\r\nhis claim to have independently detected the names of the satrapies,\r\nand thereby to have fixed the values of the Persian characters, was\r\nin consequence fiercely attacked. To the attacks made upon him,\r\nhowever, Lassen never vouchsafed a reply. Whatever his obligations to\r\nBurnouf may have been, his own contributions to the decipherment of\r\nthe inscriptions were numerous and important. He succeeded in fixing\r\nthe true values of nearly all the letters in the Persian alphabet, in\r\ntranslating the texts, and in proving that the language of them was not\r\nZend, but stood to both Zend and Sanskrit in the relation of a sister.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile another scholar, armed with fresh and important material,\r\nhad entered the field. A young English officer in the East India\r\nCompany’s service, Major Rawlinson by name, was attached to the\r\nBritish Mission in Persia. A happy inspiration led him to attempt the\r\ndecipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions. It was in 1835, when he\r\nwas twenty-five years old, that he first began his work. All that he\r\nknew was that Grotefend had discovered in the texts of Persepolis the\r\nnames of Darius, of Xerxes and of Hystaspes, but cut off as he was in\r\nhis official position at Kirmanshah on the western frontier of Persia\r\nfrom European libraries, he was unable to procure either the Memoir of\r\nthe German scholar or the articles to which it had given rise. Like\r\nBurnouf, he set himself to decipher the two inscriptions of Hamadan,\r\nwhich he had himself copied with great care. He soon recognized in them\r\nthe names that had been read by Grotefend, and thus obtained a working\r\nalphabet. But his position in Persia soon gave him an advantage which\r\nwas denied to his fellow-workers in Europe. It was not long before he\r\nfound an opportunity of copying the great inscription on the sacred\r\nrock of Behistun, which had never been copied before. It was by far\r\nthe longest cuneiform inscription yet discovered, and was filled with\r\nproper names, including those of the Persian satrapies. The copying of\r\nit, however, cost much time and labour, and was accomplished at actual\r\nrisk of life, as Major Rawlinson, better known by his later title of\r\nSir Henry Rawlinson, had to be lowered in a basket from the top of the\r\ncliff in order to ascertain the exact forms of certain characters.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE TOMB OF DARIUS.]\r\n\r\nIn the following year (1836) Rawlinson moved to Teheran, and there\r\nreceived from Edwin Norris, the Secretary of the Royal Asiatic Society,\r\nthe Memoirs of Grotefend and Saint-Martin. In 1837 he finished his copy\r\nof the Behistun inscription, and sent a translation of its opening\r\nparagraphs to the Royal Asiatic Society. Before, however, his Paper\r\ncould be published, the works of Lassen and Burnouf reached him,\r\nnecessitating a revision of his Paper and the postponement of its\r\npublication. Then came other causes of delay. He was called away to\r\nAfghanistan to perform the onerous and responsible duties of British\r\nAgent at Kandahar, and it was not until 1843 that he was once more\r\nfree to resume his cuneiform studies. A year later he was visited by\r\nthe Danish Professor, Westergaard, who placed at his disposal the\r\ncopies he had just made of the inscription on the tomb of Darius at\r\nNaksh-i-Rustam and of some shorter inscriptions from Persepolis,\r\nand Rawlinson’s Memoir was accordingly finished at last and sent\r\nto England. Here Norris subjected it to a careful revision, and at\r\nhis suggestion Rawlinson once more visited Behistun, where he took\r\nsqueezes and re-examined doubtful characters. In 1847 the first part\r\nof the Memoir was published, though the second part, containing the\r\nanalysis and commentary on the text, did not appear till 1849.[8]\r\nThe work, however, was well worthy of the time and care that had been\r\nbestowed upon it. The task of deciphering the Persian cuneiform texts\r\nwas virtually accomplished, and the guesses of Grotefend had developed\r\ninto the discovery of a new alphabet and a new language. The capstone\r\nwas put to the work by the discovery of Hincks, an Irish clergyman,\r\nthat the alphabet was not a true one in the modern sense of the word, a\r\nvowel-sound being attached in pronunciation to each of the consonants\r\nrepresented in it.\r\n\r\nThe mystery of the Persian cuneiform texts was thus solved after nearly\r\nfifty years of endeavour. A harder task still remained. The Persian\r\ntexts were accompanied by two other cuneiform transcripts, which, as\r\nGrotefend had perceived, must have represented the other two principal\r\nlanguages that were spoken in the Persian Empire. That the third\r\ntranscript was Babylonian seemed evident from the resemblance of the\r\ncharacters contained in it to those on the bricks and seal-cylinders of\r\nBabylonia. Grotefend had already written upon the subject, and had even\r\ndivined the name of Nebuchadrezzar on certain Babylonian bricks.\r\n\r\nBut this third species of writing, which we must henceforth term\r\nBabylonian or Assyrian, presented extraordinary difficulties. Instead\r\nof an alphabet of forty-two letters, the decipherer was confronted by\r\nan enormous number of different characters, while no indication was\r\ngiven of the separation of one word from another. Moreover the forms\r\nof the characters as found on the Persepolitan monuments differed\r\nconsiderably from those found on the Babylonian monuments, which\r\nagain differed greatly from each other. On the seal-cylinders, more\r\nespecially, they assumed the most complicated shapes, between which and\r\nthe Persepolitan forms it was often impossible to trace any likeness\r\nwhatever.\r\n\r\nSuddenly a discovery was made which furnished an abundance of new\r\nmaterial and incited the decipherer to fresh efforts. In 1842 Botta\r\nwas sent to Mossul as French Consul, and at Mohl’s instigation began\r\nto excavate on the site of Nineveh. His first essays there not proving\r\nvery successful, he transferred his workmen further north, to the mound\r\nof Khorsabad, and there laid bare the ruins of a large and splendid\r\npalace which subsequently turned out to be that of Sargon. In the\r\nautumn of 1845 the excavations of Botta were succeeded by those of\r\nLayard, first at Nimrûd (the ancient Calah), and then at Kûyunjik or\r\nNineveh, the result being to fill the British Museum with bas-reliefs\r\ncovered with cuneiform writing and with other relics of Assyrian\r\ncivilization.\r\n\r\nThe inscriptions brought to light by Botta were copied and published by\r\nhim in 1846–50.[9] The sumptuous work which was dedicated to them was\r\nfollowed by a smaller and cheaper edition, and the author gave further\r\nhelp to the student by classifying the characters, which amounted to\r\nas many as 642.[10] His work proved conclusively the identity of the\r\nscript used at Nineveh with that of the third transcripts on the\r\nPersian monuments, as well as the substantial agreement of the groups\r\nof characters occurring in each.\r\n\r\nThe Irish scholar Dr. Hincks--one of the most remarkable and acute\r\ndecipherers that have ever lived--was already at work on the\r\nnewly-found texts. In 1847 he published a long article on “The Three\r\nKinds of Persepolitan Writing,”[11] and, two years later, another “On\r\nthe Khorsabad Inscriptions.”[12] In 1850 he read a Paper before the\r\nBritish Association,[13] summing up his conclusions and announcing the\r\nimportant discovery that the Assyrian characters were syllabic and not\r\nalphabetic, as had hitherto been supposed. With this discovery the\r\nscientific decipherment of the Assyrian inscriptions actually begins.\r\n\r\nThe proper names contained in the Persian texts furnished the clue to\r\nthe reading of the Babylonian transcripts. The values thus obtained\r\nfor the Babylonian characters made it possible to read many of the\r\nwords, the meaning of which was fixed by a comparison with the Persian\r\noriginal. It then became clear that Assyrian was a Semitic language,\r\nstanding in much the same relation to Hebrew that the Old Persian stood\r\nto Zend.\r\n\r\nIts Semitic origin was proved to demonstration by the French scholar\r\nde Saulcy in 1849. Another French scholar, de Longpérier, had already\r\ndiscovered the name of Sargon in the Khorsabad inscriptions[14]--the\r\nfirst royal Assyrian name that had yet been read. De Saulcy himself\r\nsubjected the Babylonian transcript of the trilingual inscription of\r\nElwend to a minute analysis, and so carefully was the work performed,\r\nand so secure were the foundations upon which it rested, that the\r\ntranslation needs but little revision even to-day.[15] The old belief\r\nin the alphabetic nature of the characters, however, still possessed\r\nthe mind of the decipherer, although in one passage he goes so far as\r\nto say, “I am tempted to believe” that the signs are syllabic. But he\r\ndid not go beyond the temptation to believe, and the discovery was\r\nreserved for Hincks.\r\n\r\nRawlinson was now at Bagdad. De Saulcy sent him his Memoirs, and the\r\nBritish scholar had the immense advantage of having in his hands the\r\nBabylonian version of the great Behistun inscription, of knowing the\r\ncountry in which the monuments were found, and of possessing copies of\r\ninscriptions which had not yet made their way to Europe.\r\n\r\nNevertheless, it is amazing with what rapidity and perspicacity he\r\nforced his way through the thick jungle of cuneiform script. In his\r\nMemoir on the Persian texts, published in 1847, he already maps out\r\nwith marvellous fulness and exactitude the different varieties of\r\ncuneiform writing. It is his second Memoir, however, which excites in\r\nthe Assyriologist of to-day the profoundest feelings of surprise and\r\nadmiration. This consists of notes on the inscriptions of Assyria and\r\nBabylonia, and was communicated to the Royal Asiatic Society at the\r\nbeginning of the year 1850.[16]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BLACK OBELISK OF SHAL-MANESER II.\r\n\r\n      [_See p. 21._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: CHALDÆAN HOUSEHOLD UTENSILS IN TERRA-COTTA.\r\n\r\n      [_See p. 52._]\r\n\r\nOne of the inscriptions he has translated in full--the annals of\r\nShalmaneser II., on an obelisk of black marble discovered at Nimrûd\r\nand now in the British Museum. The text is a long one, and for the\r\nfirst time the European reader had placed before him a contemporaneous\r\naccount of the campaigns of an Assyrian monarch in the ninth century\r\nbefore our era. The translation is substantially correct; it is only\r\nin the proper names that Rawlinson has gone much astray. The values\r\nof many of the characters were still uncertain or unknown, and he was\r\nunder the domination of the belief that they represented alphabetic\r\nletters.\r\n\r\nHe was, moreover, mistaken as to the age of the monument itself, which\r\nhe assigned to too early an epoch. It was Dr. Hincks who again settled\r\nthe question, by reading upon it the names of Hazael of Damascus and\r\nJehu of Israel.[17] This was one of the first-fruits of his discovery\r\nof the syllabic character of the Assyrian signs. Another was the\r\ndiscovery of the name of Sennacherib,[18] as well as those of Hezekiah\r\nand Jerusalem.[19]\r\n\r\nShortly before this Hincks had made another discovery of importance. He\r\nhad deciphered the names of Nebuchadrezzar and his father on the bricks\r\nof Babylon,[20] and had further shown that a cylinder of Nebuchadrezzar\r\nbrought from Babylon by Sir Robert Ker-Porter, and written in the\r\ncuneiform characters met with on the Persian monuments, contained\r\nthe same text as another cylinder obtained by Sir Harford Jones, and\r\ninscribed with characters of the most complex kind. A comparison of the\r\ntwo texts gave him the values of the latter characters, which we now\r\nknow to represent the archaic Babylonian forms of the cuneiform signs.\r\n\r\nBut the decipherment of the Assyro-Babylonian script was not yet\r\ncomplete. In 1851 Rawlinson’s long-promised Memoir on the Babylonian\r\nversion of the inscription of Behistun was given to the world,[21]\r\nand consisted of the cuneiform text, with translation, grammar and\r\ncommentary, besides a list of 242 characters. It announced, moreover,\r\ntwo facts about these characters, one of which had already been\r\nrecognized, while the second was received by the Orientalists with\r\nshouts of incredulity. The first fact was that the characters, besides\r\nhaving phonetic values, could also be used ideographically to denote\r\nobjects and ideas. The second fact was that they were polyphonous, each\r\ncharacter possessing more than one phonetic value.\r\n\r\nFor once the sceptics seemed to have common-sense upon their side.\r\nHow, it was asked, could a system of writing be read the symbols of\r\nwhich might be pronounced sometimes in one way, sometimes in another?\r\nAnything could be made out of anything upon such principles, and a\r\nmethod of interpretation which ended in such a result was pronounced\r\nto be self-condemned. Hincks, however, once more entered the field and\r\ndemonstrated that Rawlinson was right.[22] Hincks was an Egyptologist,\r\nand consequently the polyphony of the cuneiform characters was not\r\nto him a new and startling phenomenon. It merely showed that they\r\nmust once have been pictorial--as, indeed, their ideographic use also\r\nindicated--and in a picture-writing each picture could necessarily\r\nbe represented by more than one word, and therefore by more than one\r\nphonetic value, when the pronunciation of the word came to be employed\r\nphonetically. The picture of a foot, for instance, would denote not\r\nonly a “foot,” but also such ideas as “go,” “run,” “walk,” each of\r\nwhich would become one of its phonetic values with the development of\r\nthe picture into a conventional syllabic sign.\r\n\r\nExcavation was still proceeding on the site of Nineveh. Mr. Hormuzd\r\nRassam, himself a native of Mossul and the active assistant of Layard,\r\nwas sent in 1852 by the British Museum to complete the work from\r\nwhich Layard had now been called away by diplomatic duties.[23] In\r\n1853 he made a discovery which proved to be of momentous importance\r\nfor Assyrian decipherment, and without which, in fact, it could never\r\nhave advanced very far. He discovered the library of Nineveh with its\r\nmultitudes of closely-written clay tablets, many of them containing\r\nlong lists of characters, dictionaries and grammars, which have served\r\nat once to verify and to extend the knowledge of the script and\r\nlanguage that the early decipherers had obtained. Meanwhile a careful\r\nsurvey of the whole country was made at the expense of the East India\r\nCompany,[24] and the French Government sent out an exploring and\r\nexcavating expedition to Babylonia under a young and brilliant scholar,\r\nJules Oppert. The results of the mission, which lasted from 1851 to\r\n1854, were embodied in two learned volumes, the first of which appeared\r\nin 1863.[25] In these Oppert showed, what Hincks and Rawlinson had\r\nalready pointed out, that the peculiarities of the Assyrian syllabary\r\nwere due not only to its pictorial origin but also to the fact that it\r\nhad been invented by a non-Semitic people. This primitive population of\r\nBabylonia, called Akkadian by Hincks, Sumerian by Oppert, had spoken\r\nan agglutinative language similar to that of the Turks or Finns, and\r\nhad been the founders of Babylonian civilization. For these views\r\nOppert found support in the tablets of the library of Nineveh, a large\r\npart of which consists of translations from the older language into\r\nSemitic Assyrian, as well as of comparative grammars, vocabularies and\r\nreading-books in the two languages.\r\n\r\nOnce more the Semitic scholars protested. There was no end to the\r\nextravagant fantasies of the Assyriologists! The learned world was\r\ncomfortably convinced that none but a Semitic or Aryan people could\r\nhave been the originators of civilization, and to assert that the\r\nSemites had borrowed their culture from a race which seemed to have\r\naffinities with Mongols or Tatars was an outrage upon established\r\nprejudices. The Semitic philologist was more certain than ever that\r\nAssyrian decipherment was the folly of a few “untrained” amateurs, and\r\ncould safely be disregarded.\r\n\r\nBut the little band of Assyriologists pursued their labours\r\nundisturbed. In 1855–6 Hincks published a most remarkable series of\r\narticles in the _Journal of Sacred Literature_, in which the\r\nvarious forms of the Assyrian verb were analyzed and given once for\r\nall. The work has never had to be repeated, and the foundations of\r\nAssyrian grammar were solidly laid. A few years later (in 1860) a\r\ncomplete grammar of the language was published by Oppert. The initial\r\nstage of Assyrian decipherment was thus at an end.\r\n\r\nWe must now turn back to the second transcript of the Persian\r\ninscriptions, which, thanks to its greater simplicity, had been\r\ndeciphered before the Assyro-Babylonian. The way was opened in 1844 by\r\nthe Danish scholar Westergaard.[26] With the help of the proper names\r\nhe fixed the values of many of the characters and made a tentative\r\nendeavour to read the texts. But the language he brought to light was\r\nof so strange a nature as to throw doubt on the correctness of his\r\nmethod. Turkish, Arabic, Indian and even Keltic elements seemed alike\r\nto be mingled in it. It was not, therefore, till his readings had been\r\nsubjected to revision by Hincks in 1846[27] and de Saulcy in 1850[28]\r\nthat any confidence was reposed in it, and the results made available\r\nfor the decipherment of the Babylonian transcripts, the characters of\r\nwhich frequently had the same forms. It must be remembered, however,\r\nthat Westergaard worked from defective materials. Rawlinson had not yet\r\npublished his copy of the Behistun inscription, which he eventually\r\nplaced in the hands of Edwin Norris, who, in 1853, edited the text\r\nalong with a syllabary, grammar and vocabulary, as well as translations\r\nand commentary.[29] This edition was a splendid piece of work, and\r\nwith it the decipherment of the second transcript of the Persian\r\ninscriptions may be said to have been accomplished. Oppert’s _Peuple\r\net Langage des Médes_, which appeared in 1870, did but revise,\r\nsupplement and systematize the work of Norris.\r\n\r\nThe new language which had thus been brought to light was\r\nagglutinative. Westergaard had seen in it the language of the Medes,\r\nand, like Rawlinson, had connected it with a hypothetical “Scythian”\r\nfamily of speech. The term “Scythian” was retained by Norris, who,\r\nhowever, attempted to show that it was really related to the Finnish\r\ndialects. But the excavations made at Susa by Loftus in 1851 put\r\nanother face on the matter. In 1874, and again more fully in 1883,[30]\r\nI pointed out that the inscriptions found at Susa and other ancient\r\nElamite sites were in an older form of the same language as that\r\nof the second Achæmenian transcripts, and furthermore that certain\r\ninscriptions discovered by Layard in the plain of Mal-Amîr eastward\r\nof Susa were in practically the same script and dialect. At the same\r\ntime I fixed the values of the characters in the Mal-Amîr texts\r\nand gave provisional translations of them, with a vocabulary and\r\ncommentary. Oppert and myself had already been working at the reading\r\nof the older Susian inscriptions, a task in which we were followed by\r\nWeissbach with a greater measure of success. But the same cause which\r\nhad retarded the decipherment of the second transcript of the Persian\r\ninscriptions--a want of materials--militated against any great advance\r\nbeing made in the decipherment of the older Susian, and it is only\r\nsince 1897, when the excavations of M. de Morgan at Susa were begun,\r\nthat the student has been at last provided with the necessary means.\r\nThanks to the brilliant penetration of the French Assyriologist, Dr.\r\nScheil, the outlines of the language of the ancient kingdom of Elam can\r\nnow be sketched with a fair amount of completeness and accuracy.[31]\r\nThe name of Neo-Susian has by common consent been conferred upon the\r\nlanguage of the second Achæmenian transcripts; perhaps Neo-Elamite\r\nwould be better. At all events it represents the language of the second\r\ncapital of the Persian Empire as it was spoken in the age of Darius and\r\nhis successors, and is a lineal descendant of the old agglutinative\r\nlanguage of Elam.\r\n\r\nThe three systems of cuneiform script, which a hundred years ago seemed\r\nso impenetrable in their mystery, have thus, one by one, been forced\r\nto yield their secrets. But as each in turn has been deciphered,\r\nfresh forms of cuneiform writing and new languages expressed in\r\ncuneiform characters have come to light. The first to emerge was that\r\nagglutinative language of primitive Chaldæa which so scandalized\r\nthe philological world and excited such strong distrust of the\r\nAssyriologists. The question of the name by which it should be called\r\nhas been set at rest by the discovery of tablets in which its native\r\ndesignation is made known to us. Some years ago Bezold published a\r\nbilingual text in which it is termed “the language of Sumer,”[32] and\r\nmore recently Messerschmidt has edited a bilingual inscription of the\r\nBabylonian king Samsu-ditana in which the Semitic “translation” is\r\ndescribed as “Akkadian.”[33] Oppert is thus shown to have been right in\r\nthe name which he proposed to give to the language of the inventors of\r\nthe cuneiform script.\r\n\r\nThe first analysis of Sumerian grammar was made by myself in 1870, when\r\nthe general outlines of the language were fixed and the verbal forms\r\nread and explained.[34] Three years later Lenormant threw the materials\r\nI had collected into a connected and systematic form, one result of\r\nwhich was a controversy started by the Orientalist, Joseph Halévy, who\r\nmaintained that Sumerian was not a language at all, but a cryptograph\r\nor secret writing. The answers made by the Assyriologists to this\r\ncurious theory obliged its author constantly to shift his ground,\r\nbut at the same time it also obliged them to examine their materials\r\nmore carefully and to revise conclusions which had been arrived at on\r\ninsufficient evidence. An important discovery was now made by Haupt,\r\nwho had already given the first scientific translation of a Sumerian\r\ntext;[35] he demonstrated the existence of two dialects, one of\r\nwhich is marked by all the phenomena of phonetic decay.[36] This was\r\nnaturally supposed to indicate a difference of age in the two dialects,\r\nthe one being the older and the other the later form of the language.\r\nSubsequent research, however, has gone to show that the two dialects\r\nwere really used contemporaneously, the decayed state of that which was\r\ncalled “the woman’s language” by the Babylonians being due to the fact\r\nthat it was spoken in Akkad or Northern Babylonia, where the Semitic\r\nelement became predominant at a much earlier period than in Sumer or\r\nSouthern Babylonia.\r\n\r\nUp to this time the study of Sumerian had been almost entirely confined\r\nto the bilingual texts, of which a very large number existed in the\r\nlibrary of Nineveh, and in which a Semitic translation was attached to\r\nthe Sumerian original. Now, however, the French excavations at Tello in\r\nSouthern Babylonia began to furnish European scholars with monuments\r\nof the pre-Semitic period, and to these the decipherers, among whom\r\nAmiaud and Thureau Dangin hold the first place, accordingly turned\r\ntheir attention. Texts composed in days when Sumerian princes still\r\ngoverned the country, and written by scribes who were unacquainted with\r\na Semitic language, were successfully attacked with the assistance of\r\nthe bilingual tablets of Nineveh. But it was soon found that between\r\nthese genuine examples of Sumerian composition and the Sumerian which\r\nwas written and explained by Semitic scribes there was a good deal of\r\ndifference. The Semites had derived their culture from their Sumerian\r\npredecessors, and a considerable part of the religious and legal\r\nliterature that had been handed on to them was in the older language.\r\nThis older language long continued to be that of both religion and\r\nlaw, the two conservative forces in society, Sumerian becoming to the\r\nSemitic Babylonians what Latin was to mediæval Europe. The inevitable\r\nresult followed: Semitic idioms and modes of thought were clothed\r\nin a Sumerian dress, and the ignorance of the scribe produced not\r\ninfrequently the equivalent of the dog-Latin of a modern school-boy.\r\nThe gradual changes that took place in the cuneiform system of writing,\r\nand the adaptation of it to the requirements of Semitic speech,\r\ncontributed to the creation of an artificial and quite unclassical\r\nSumerian, and the lexical tablets became filled with uses and\r\ncombinations of characters which were professedly Sumerian but really\r\nSemitic in origin. All this renders the decipherment of a Sumerian text\r\neven now a difficult affair, and many years must elapse before we can\r\nsay that the stage of decipherment is definitely passed and that the\r\nscholar may content himself with a purely philological treatment of the\r\nlanguage.\r\n\r\nBut Sumerian was not the only new language outside the circle\r\nrecognized by the Persian monarchs which the decipherment of the\r\ncuneiform characters has revealed to us. Even before the discovery\r\nof Sumerian, cuneiform inscriptions had been copied on the rocks and\r\nquarried stones of Armenia, which, when the characters composing\r\nthem came to be read, proved to belong to a language as novel and as\r\napparently unrelated to any other as Sumerian itself. As far back\r\nas 1826 a young scholar of the name of Schulz had been sent by the\r\nFrench Government to Van in Armenia, where, according to Armenian\r\nwriters, Semiramis, the fabled queen of Assyria, had once left her\r\nmonuments. Here Schulz actually found that the cliff on which the\r\nancient fortress of the city stood was covered with lines of cuneiform\r\ncharacters, and similar inscriptions soon came to light in other parts\r\nof the country. Before Schulz, however, could return to Europe he was\r\nmurdered (in 1829) by a Kurdish chief, whose guest he had been. But his\r\npapers were recovered, and the copies of the inscriptions he had made\r\nwere published in 1840 in the _Journal Asiatique_. The first to\r\nattempt to read them was Dr. Hincks, whom no problem in decipherment\r\never seemed to baffle.[37] The characters, he showed, were practically\r\nidentical with those found in the Assyrian texts, the values of many of\r\nwhich had now been ascertained; but Hincks, with his usual acuteness,\r\nwent on to use the Armenian or Vannic inscriptions for settling\r\nthe values of other Assyrian characters which had not as yet been\r\ndetermined. In 1848 he was already able to read the names of the Vannic\r\nkings and fix their succession, to make out the sense of several\r\npassages in the texts, and to indicate the nominative and accusative\r\nsuffixes of the noun.\r\n\r\nHere Vannic decipherment rested for many years. There was no difficulty\r\nin reading the inscriptions phonetically, for they were written in a\r\nvery simplified form of the Assyrian syllabary; but the language which\r\nwas thus revealed stood isolated and alone, without linguistic kindred\r\neither ancient or modern. The various attempts made to decipher it were\r\nall failures.\r\n\r\nSo things remained until 1882–3, when I published my Memoir on “The\r\nDecipherment of the Vannic Inscriptions” in the _Journal of the Royal\r\nAsiatic Society_. Here for the first time translations were given of\r\nthe inscriptions, together with a commentary, grammar and vocabulary.\r\nAt the same time I settled the chronological place of the Vannic kings,\r\nwhich had hitherto been uncertain, as well as the geography of the\r\ncountry over which they ruled, and analyzed the ancient religion of\r\nthe people as made known to us by the decipherment of the texts. In\r\nrevising and supplementing Schulz’s copies of the inscriptions I had\r\nobtained the help of squeezes taken by Layard and Rassam. The task\r\nof decipherment was, after all, not so hard a matter as the absence\r\nof a bilingual text might make it appear. The want of a bilingual\r\nwas compensated by the numerous ideographs and “determinatives”\r\nscattered through the inscriptions, which indicated their general\r\nmeaning, pointed out to the decipherer the names of countries,\r\ncities, individuals and the like, and gave him the signification of\r\nthe phonetically-written words which in parallel passages often\r\nreplaced them. Moreover, the French Assyriologist, Stanislas Guyard,\r\nand myself had independently made the discovery that a clause which\r\nfrequently comes at the end of a Vannic inscription corresponds with\r\nthe imprecatory formula of the Assyrians, while the decipherment of\r\nthe inscriptions led to the further discovery that not only had the\r\ncharacters employed in them been borrowed from the Assyrians in the\r\ntime of the Assyrian conqueror, Assur-natsir-pal, but that many of the\r\nphrases used in Assur-natsir-pal’s texts had been borrowed at the same\r\ntime.\r\n\r\nOther scholars soon appeared to pursue and extend my work, more\r\nespecially Drs. Belck and Lehmann, whose expedition to Armenia in 1898\r\nhas placed at our disposal a large store of fresh material. Amongst\r\nthis fresh material are two long bilingual inscriptions, in Vannic and\r\nAssyrian, one of which had been discovered by de Morgan in 1890. These\r\nhave verified my system of decipherment, have increased our knowledge\r\nof the Vannic vocabulary, have corrected a few errors, and, I am bound\r\nto add, have in one or two cases justified renderings of mine to which\r\nexception had been taken. A historical Vannic text can now be read with\r\nalmost as much certainty as an Assyrian one.\r\n\r\nWith the discovery of the language spoken in Armenia before the arrival\r\nof the modern Armenians the list of lost languages and dialects\r\nbrought to light by the decipherment of the cuneiform script is by no\r\nmeans exhausted. Among the tablets found in 1887 at Tel el-Amarna in\r\nUpper Egypt was a long letter from the king of Mitanni or Northern\r\nMesopotamia in the native language of his country, which has been\r\npartially deciphered by Messerschmidt, Jensen and myself.[38] The\r\nlanguage turns out to be distantly related to the Vannic, but is of\r\na much more complicated description. Two of the other letters in the\r\nsame collection were in yet another previously unknown language, which\r\nthe contents of one of them showed to be that of a kingdom in Asia\r\nMinor called Arzawa. Since then tablets have been found at Boghaz Keui\r\nin Cappadocia, on the site of the ancient capital of the Hittites,\r\nwhich are in the same dialect and form of cuneiform writing, and prove\r\nthat in them we have discovered at last actual relics of the Hittite\r\ntongue. Thanks to the light thrown upon them by a tablet from the same\r\nlocality, which I obtained last year, it is now possible to raise the\r\nveil which has hitherto concealed the Hittite language, and in a Paper\r\nwhich will shortly be printed I have succeeded in partially translating\r\nthe texts and sketching the outlines of their grammar. But any detailed\r\naccount of these discoveries must be reserved for a future chapter; at\r\npresent I can do no more than refer briefly to these latest problems in\r\ncuneiform decipherment.\r\n\r\nThat other problems still await us cannot be doubted. The number of\r\ndifferent languages which the decipherment of the cuneiform script\r\nhas thus far revealed to us is an assurance that, as excavation and\r\nresearch proceed, fresh languages will come to light which have\r\nemployed the cuneiform syllabary as a means of expression. Indeed, we\r\nalready know that it was used by the Kossæans, wild mountaineers who\r\nskirted the eastern frontiers of Babylonia, and a list of whose words\r\nhas been preserved in a cuneiform tablet,[39] and also that there was\r\na time, before the introduction of the Phœnician alphabet, when “the\r\nlanguage of Canaan”--better known as Hebrew--was written in cuneiform\r\ncharacters. Canaanite glosses are found in the Tel el-Amarna tablets,\r\nand two Sidonian seals exist in which the cuneiform syllabary is\r\nemployed to represent the sounds of Canaanitish speech.[40]\r\n\r\nAnd the key to all this varied literature, this medley of languages,\r\nthe very names of which had perished, was a simple guess! But it was a\r\nscientific guess, made in accordance with scientific method, and based\r\nupon sound scientific reasoning. It is true that it needed the slow\r\nand patient work of generations of scholars before the guess could\r\nripen into maturity; the discovery of the value of a single letter\r\nin the Old Persian alphabet was sometimes the labour of a lifetime;\r\nbut, like the seed of the mustard tree, the guess contained within\r\nitself all the promise of its future growth. On the day when Grotefend\r\nidentified the names of Darius and Xerxes, the decipherment of the\r\ncuneiform inscriptions, and therewith of the history, the theology\r\nand the civilization of the ancient Oriental world, was potentially\r\naccomplished.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER II\r\n\r\n             THE ARCHÆOLOGICAL MATERIALS; THE EXCAVATIONS\r\n                   AT SUSA AND THE ORIGIN OF BRONZE\r\n\r\n\r\nThe modern science of archæology has been derisively called “the study\r\nof pots.” As a matter of fact, the study of ancient pottery occupies a\r\nprominent place in it, and we cannot turn over the pages of a standard\r\narchæological work without constantly coming across photographs and\r\nillustrations of the ceramic art or reading descriptions of vases\r\nand bowls, of coloured ware and fragmentary sherds. Questions of\r\ndate and origin are made to turn on the presence or absence of some\r\nparticular form of pottery on a given site, and fierce controversies\r\nhave arisen over a single fragment of a vessel of clay. A knowledge of\r\nancient pottery is a primary requisite in the scientific excavator and\r\narchæologist of to-day.\r\n\r\nThe reason of this is obvious. Archæology is an inductive science;\r\nits conclusions, therefore, are drawn from the comparison and\r\nco-ordination of objects which can be seen and handled, as well as\r\ntested by all competent observers. It is built upon what our German\r\nfriends would call objective facts, and the method it employs is that\r\ncarefully-disciplined and experimentally-guarded application of the\r\nordinary logic of life which can alone give us scientific results.\r\nThe method is one which the purely literary mind seems often curiously\r\nincapable of comprehending; the literary student is accustomed to deal\r\nso exclusively with matters of merely individual taste and theory\r\nthat he is as little able to understand what is meant by scientific\r\nevidence and probability as the scholar who is not a mathematician is\r\nable to follow the reasoning of Lord Kelvin. This is a fact which has\r\nto be borne in mind more especially in archæological science, for the\r\nquestions with which archæology is concerned so frequently invade the\r\ndomain of literature or appear so closely connected with questions that\r\nare more or less literary, that the purely literary scholar is apt to\r\nthink himself just as well qualified to discuss them as “the man in the\r\nstreet” is apt to think himself qualified to discuss the etymology of a\r\nword. To all such the archæologist would say, “Go and study your pots.”\r\n\r\nFor pottery is practically indestructible. Like the fossils on which\r\nthe geologist has built up the past history of life upon the earth, it\r\nis an enduring evidence, when rightly interpreted, of the past history\r\nof man. Like the fossils, moreover, it exhibits a multitudinous variety\r\nof types and forms. But in all these types and forms there is an\r\nunderlying unity. The primitive needs of man are everywhere the same,\r\nand the powers of mind called in to supply them are the same also.\r\nThe dish and bowl, the vase and its handles, meet us again and again\r\nwherever we go; and the same materials for making them meet us also.\r\nThe hands of man, guided by the brain of man, found clay wherewith to\r\nmanufacture the vessels that he needed, and to harden it afterwards in\r\nthe sun or fire. Where or how the first pottery was made we do not\r\nknow, we probably shall never know. When palæolithic man first makes\r\nhis appearance in Europe he seems not yet to have been acquainted with\r\nit; but it is difficult to prove a negative in archæology as in other\r\nsciences, and the absence of palæolithic pottery may be due only to\r\nthe imperfection of the record. At any rate, as we descend the ladder\r\nof chronology the existence of man is marked more and more by the\r\nfragments of pottery he has left behind him; at Rome a whole mountain\r\nof it grew up in the space of a few centuries, and the huge mounds that\r\nencircled Cairo a hundred years ago were mainly formed of mediæval\r\nsherds. When excavating on an Egyptian site I have sometimes been\r\ntempted to think that the people who once lived there must have spent\r\ntheir whole time in breaking their household ware.\r\n\r\nNow not only are the primitive needs of man much the same throughout\r\nthe world and at all periods of time, the nature of man is much\r\nthe same also; and a distinguishing feature in his nature is love\r\nof variety. The same variety which we see in the forms of life and\r\nin the outward appearance and mental aptitudes of man himself is\r\nreflected in the products of his skill. Yet along with this love of\r\nvariety goes a strong conservative or imitative instinct--an instinct\r\nwhich finds, too, its counterpart in nature, “so careful of the\r\ntype.” On the one hand, fashions change; on the other, a fashion once\r\nintroduced spreads rapidly and maintains itself to the exclusion of\r\nall others for a determinate period of time throughout a determinate\r\narea. And to nothing does this apply with more truth than to pottery.\r\nObservation has shown that not only are different tribes or countries\r\ndistinguished by a difference in their pottery, but that in each tribe\r\nor country similar differences distinguish successive periods of time.\r\nWhen to this is added the practical indestructibility of the potsherd,\r\nit will easily be seen what a criterion is afforded by it for fixing\r\nthe age and character of ancient remains, and their relation to other\r\nmonuments of the past. It is not surprising that a study of pottery\r\nhas become the sheet-anchor of archæological chronology, and that the\r\nfirst object of the scientific excavator is to determine the relative\r\nsuccession of the ceramic remains he discovers and their connection\r\nwith similar remains found elsewhere. Scientific excavation means,\r\nbefore all things else, careful observation and record of every piece\r\nof pottery, however apparently worthless, which the excavator disinters.\r\n\r\nBut now, unfortunately, I have to make an admission. We have, as yet,\r\nno ceramic record in either Babylonia or Assyria. Until very recently\r\nthere has been no attempt in either country at scientific excavation.\r\nThe pioneers, Layard and Botta and Loftus, lived and worked before it\r\nwas known or thought of, and we cannot, therefore, be too thankful to\r\nLayard for having nevertheless given us so full and accurate an account\r\nof what he found, and the conditions under which he found it. The\r\nexcavations controlled by the British Museum have, I am sorry to say,\r\nbeen for the most part destructive rather than scientific; such objects\r\nas were wanted by the Museum were alone sought after; little or no\r\nrecord has been kept of their discovery, and they have been mixed with\r\nobjects bought from natives, of whose origin nothing was known. At one\r\nspot, Carchemish, the old Hittite capital, which, though not strictly\r\nin Assyria, formed part of the Assyrian Empire, and was the seat of an\r\nAssyrian governor, the so-called excavations conducted by the Museum in\r\n1880 were simply a scandal, which Dr. Hayes Ward, who visited the spot\r\nshortly afterwards, has characterized as “wicked.” The archæological\r\nevidence there, which would have thrown so much light on the Hittite\r\nproblem, has been irretrievably lost.\r\n\r\nMatters are better now, and if I may judge from the work done by Mr.\r\nH. R. Hall at Dêr el-Bâharî in Egypt for the Egypt Exploration Fund,\r\nhis colleague, Mr. L. W. King, who has recently been excavating for\r\nthe British Museum in Assyria, will have done something to retrieve\r\nthe archæological good name of our British excavators in the East.\r\nM. de Sarzec’s excavations at Tello in Southern Babylonia were also\r\nconducted with some consideration for archæological method, at all\r\nevents on the architectural side, and in the capable hands of M.\r\nHeuzey the works of art found there have been made to yield valuable\r\nresults. Moreover, the history of Tello may be said to be comprised\r\nin a single epoch of archaic Babylonia, and all objects discovered\r\non the site may consequently be regarded as belonging to one age\r\nand phase of Babylonian civilization. Of the American excavations\r\nat Niffer it is difficult to speak at present. The work there has\r\nbeen careful and patient, and has extended over a long series of\r\nyears. The architectural facts have been accurately recorded, at\r\nall events in the case of the great temple of Bel, and about the\r\nsequence of the inscribed monuments there is little room for\r\ndoubt. But accusations of carelessness have lately been brought by\r\nthe excavators one against the other, and when we find the sharpest\r\ncritic among them unable to substantiate his own account of the\r\ndiscovery of a library and implicitly endorsing the assignment of a\r\nParthian palace to the “Mykenæan” age, it is impossible to put much\r\nfaith in their descriptions of archæological details. Some years ago\r\nthe Germans explored a cemetery at El-Hibba with considerable care\r\nand thoroughness, and thus revealed to us pretty much all we know at\r\npresent about Babylonian funereal customs; yet here again too little\r\nattention was paid to the pottery, and the actual date of the cemetery\r\nis still uncertain. It may belong to the Babylonian period, but it may\r\nalso not be older than the Persian or even Parthian age.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n      THE TELL OF JERABIS (PROBABLY THE ANCIENT CARCHEMISH).]\r\n\r\nThe Germans are once more working in the lands of the Euphrates and\r\nTigris, but in Babylonia their labours have been mainly confined\r\nto the Babylon of Nebuchadrezzar, where comparatively little has\r\nbeen discovered. Since 1904, however, the chief strength of the\r\nexpedition has been directed upon Qal’at Shirqât, where Assur, the\r\nprimitive capital of Assyria, formerly stood, and here we may expect\r\nthat archæological results of first-class importance will at last be\r\nobtained. But the work there has not yet advanced far enough for more\r\nto be done than the mapping out of the old city, the ascertainment of\r\ncertain architectural facts, and the recovery of inscriptions of great\r\nhistorical value.\r\n\r\nIt will be seen, therefore, that the reproach brought against\r\nexcavations in Egypt by Mr. Rhind in 1862 still holds good of\r\nexcavations in Babylonia and Assyria. The first stage in their\r\nhistory is only just passing away. The idea that excavation is a trade\r\nwhich any one can take up without previous training, and that all the\r\nexcavator need think about is the discovery of objects for a museum,\r\nis only beginning to disappear. In 1862 Rhind could write of Egyptian\r\ntombs: “I am not aware that there can be found the contents of a\r\nsingle sepulchre duly authenticated with satisfactory precision as to\r\nwhat objects were present, and as to the relative positions all these\r\noccupied when deposited by contemporary hands. Indeed, for many of the\r\nEgyptian sepulchral antiquities scattered over Europe there exists\r\nno record to determine even the part of the country where they were\r\nexhumed.... There have thus been swept away unrecorded into the past\r\nillustrative facts of very great interest, which cannot now, according\r\nto any reasonable probability, be replaced, at all events in the degree\r\nwhich there are grounds to believe were then possible.”[41] Happily,\r\nMr. Rhind’s words are no longer true of Egypt, where he himself set the\r\nfirst example of showing how scientific exploration ought to be carried\r\non, and the result is that the ancient civilization and culture of\r\nEgypt are now known to us even better than those of classical Greece or\r\nRome.\r\n\r\nBut what was true in 1862 of Egypt is still very largely true of\r\nAssyria and Babylonia. We are beginning to know something about the\r\nhistory of Assyro-Babylonian architecture; we know a little about the\r\nearly work of the Babylonians in metal and stone; but the history of\r\nAssyro-Babylonian pottery is still, speaking broadly, a blank. For\r\nmost of his knowledge of the ancient Euphratean civilizations the\r\narchæologist has to turn to the inscriptions and written literature of\r\nwhich such vast quantities have survived, and hence, besides being an\r\narchæologist in the strict sense, he must be also a decipherer and a\r\nphilologist. He is still precluded from appealing to the evidence which\r\ncan be handled and felt.\r\n\r\nFrom the point of view of the archæologist written evidence is usually\r\nunsatisfactory because it admits of more than one interpretation. A\r\ntranslation which seems certain to one scholar may be questioned by\r\nanother; an inference drawn from the words of a text by one student\r\nmay be denied by another. The statements in the texts themselves may\r\nbe contradictory, or their imperfection may lead to wrong conclusions.\r\nAbove all, the evidence may come to the archæologist from a philologist\r\nwhose bent of mind is literary rather than scientific, and who will\r\ntherefore be unable either to appreciate or to understand scientific\r\ntestimony. Nothing is more common than to come across literary critics\r\nwho cannot be made to understand the nature of inductive proof.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, the decipherer of a lost language must necessarily\r\nbe an archæologist as well. The clues he follows will be largely\r\narchæological, and he has to appeal to archæology at every step.\r\nThe method he must pursue is the method of archæology and of other\r\ninductive sciences, and the materials he uses are in part the materials\r\nof archæology also. The philologist who knows nothing of history and\r\ngeography, who is unable to follow a scientific argument and appreciate\r\nscientific reasoning, can never decipher; he may take the materials\r\ngiven him by the decipherer and work them into philological shape,\r\nbut that is all. We must listen to him on questions of grammar and\r\nvocabulary; on questions of archæology his opinions are worth no more\r\nthan those of the ordinary man.\r\n\r\nI have insisted on this point because it is a very important one in\r\na study like Assyriology. The public naturally thinks that in all\r\nAssyriological matters the opinion of one Assyriologist is as good as\r\nthat of another. We might just as well suppose that in all matters\r\nwhich come under the head of astronomy the opinions of every class\r\nof astronomer are equally authoritative. But in astronomy there are\r\nquestions which are purely mathematical, and there are other questions\r\nwhich are more or less chemical, and the astronomer who has devoted\r\nhis attention to the spectrum analysis is contented to leave to his\r\nmathematical colleague abstruse calculations in advanced mathematics.\r\nThe Assyriologist who is a grammarian pure and simple is just as little\r\nan authority on the archæological side of his study as any one else who\r\nis ignorant of archæology, and the materials he provides must be dealt\r\nwith by the archæologist like the literary materials provided for him\r\nby the classical philologist; the materials in both cases stand on the\r\nsame footing.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, there is a difference between them. In the first\r\nplace, the literary materials with which the Assyriologist deals are\r\nin a very large number of instances autographs. They are the actual\r\ndocuments of the writers whose names they bear or to whose age they\r\nbelong. And there is all the difference in the world between the\r\nletters of a Plato or a Cicero which have come down to us through\r\nnumerous copyists and the letters of Khammu-rabi of Babylon, the\r\noriginals of which are now in our hands. The inscriptions in which\r\nNebuchadrezzar describes his building operations or the contemporaneous\r\nannals of the Assyrian kings are, from the historical point of view,\r\nof far more value than the books written about them at a later date,\r\nhowever admirable the latter may be as works of literature; in other\r\nwords, they are first-hand sources, and, as such, objective facts of\r\nmuch the same character as ancient pottery or stone implements. Then,\r\nin the second place, the documents have to be deciphered before they\r\ncan be treated philologically; and, as I have already said, the task\r\nof decipherment is in itself an archæological pursuit. If carried\r\nout on correct lines it is itself an instance of the application of\r\nthe inductive method, and it is, moreover, constantly compelled to\r\ncall archæology or history to its aid. Assyriology is thus primarily\r\nan archæological study, using the methods of archæological science\r\nand demanding the help of the archæologist, even though there are\r\nAssyriologists who are not archæologists themselves.\r\n\r\nBut for the present our archæological facts have to be taken\r\nmainly from the results of the decipherment of the inscriptions.\r\nThey are for the most part epigraphical; the excavator has not yet\r\nsupplemented them, as in Egypt or prehistoric Greece, on what I would\r\nterm the ceramic side. This, at least, is the case in Babylonia and\r\nAssyria. It is no longer the case, however, throughout the ancient\r\nAssyro-Babylonian world. There is one exception to the charge brought\r\nby modern archæology against the excavators in the lands of the Tigris\r\nand Euphrates. M. de Morgan has been working for the last ten years\r\non the site of Susa, the capital of Elam, and he has brought to his\r\nlabours the knowledge and experience of an excavator who has been\r\ntrained in modern methods and is fully awake to the requirements of\r\nmodern science. At last, at Susa, we have an archæological record of\r\nthe history of culture, based not only on written monuments, but also\r\non the more tangible evidence of scientifically-observed strata of\r\nhuman remains. It is true that Elam is not Babylonia; but one of the\r\nsurprises of M. de Morgan’s discoveries is that in the early days of\r\nBabylonian history Elam was a Babylonian province, and Susa the seat of\r\na Babylonian governor. The same culture extended from Sippara on the\r\nEuphrates to Susa in Elam, and this culture was Babylonian. Hence, in\r\ndefault of materials from Babylonia itself, we may see in the history\r\nof cultural development at Susa a counterpart of that in Babylonia, at\r\nany rate during the period when Elam and Babylonia were alike under\r\nSemitic rule.[42]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE TUMULUS OF SUSA, AS IT APPEARED TOWARDS THE MIDDLE\r\n  OF LAST CENTURY.]\r\n\r\nAt Susa the line of division between the prehistoric or neolithic\r\nage and the historical epoch is very clearly marked. The prehistoric\r\nstratum lies twenty-five metres below the surface of the mounds, and\r\nis divided by M. de Morgan and his fellow-workers into two periods.\r\nThe first is distinguished by a fine thin pottery, with yellow paste,\r\nwhich is already made upon a wheel. It does not exceed from two to\r\nseven millimetres in thickness; it is polished, and decorated with\r\nblack bands and various patterns in a brown colour produced by oxide\r\nof iron. The designs are not only geometric, but also represent animal\r\nand vegetable forms. Among them are rows of ostriches identical with\r\nthose found on the painted prehistoric pottery of Egypt. Indeed, the\r\nexplorers were especially struck by the resemblance of the pottery as a\r\nwhole to that of Egypt in the prehistoric age, though it is difficult\r\nto see what connection there can have been between the two countries at\r\nso remote a date, and the curious similarity between the rows of birds\r\ndepicted on the vases must remain for the present an archæological\r\npuzzle. There is also a certain amount of resemblance between the\r\ngeometric pottery and that disinterred by M. Chantre at the early\r\nAssyrian colony at Kara Eyuk in Cappadocia, which will be discussed\r\nmore fully in a later chapter.[43] Among the geometrical patterns of\r\nthe Susian ware spherical forms are common; the herring-bone pattern is\r\nalso met with, as well as a pattern like the Greek _sigma_. The\r\nunder-part of the vases is often decorated, so also is the inside. A\r\nform of vase frequently found is the water-jar with a rounded foot; the\r\ngoblet is another common shape. Sometimes the vases are supplied with\r\nfour handles for suspension.\r\n\r\nThis fine yellow pottery occurs not only at Susa, but also throughout\r\nElam, but practically none of it has hitherto been discovered in\r\nBabylonia.[44] One cause of this is doubtless that in the alluvial\r\nplain of Babylonia a purely neolithic stratum, if it existed at all,\r\nwould lie below the water-level. Maritime shells are met with as far\r\nnorth as the site of Babylon, showing that the Persian Gulf once\r\nextended thus far, and the water of the Euphrates still infiltrates\r\nthrough the soil.\r\n\r\nThe period of the fine thin pottery in Elam comes suddenly to an\r\nend, and the people of the second prehistoric period seem to have\r\nbeen intruders who were less civilized than their predecessors and\r\nunacquainted with the art of making the older ware. Their pottery is\r\ncoarse and porous, and the geometric designs upon it are traced with\r\nthe pen, not freely painted as in the case of the earlier ceramic. The\r\nanimal and vegetable designs of the older ware have disappeared, and\r\nthe zones, triangles and other geometric figures which take their place\r\nare traced in black or maroon-red upon a yellow clay. The resemblance\r\nbetween this pottery and that of Kara Eyuk is even greater than in the\r\ncase of the pottery of the first period. Thick cylindrical vases are\r\ncommon, as well as bowls with a flat bottom and broad sides. Some of\r\nthe vases resemble the bulbous vases of the Egyptian Twelfth dynasty;\r\nthere are others with flat bottoms and angular sides which are also\r\nlike Egyptian water-jars of the same Twelfth-dynasty period. Along with\r\nthese more characteristic forms of pottery many small, unpainted cups\r\nhave been found, as well as a few finer wheel-made vases of ovoid shape\r\nand yellow or reddish colour. It should be added that coarse, red,\r\nhand-made pottery abounds in both the prehistoric periods, as indeed it\r\ndoes also in the later historic epoch.\r\n\r\nAs the second prehistoric epoch drew to a close at Susa, many\r\nindications of an advance in culture began to show themselves. Vases\r\nand flat-bottomed cups of soft stone were introduced, among them\r\nbeing a few of alabaster; the bricks began to be burnt in a kiln, and\r\neven seals with a species of writing upon them made their appearance.\r\nNevertheless, the neolithic age does not pass into the age of metal\r\nthrough any transitional stages.\r\n\r\nThe earliest stratum which marks the historic age yields for the first\r\ntime clay tablets with inscriptions, the characters of which are\r\nalready developing out of pictures into the cursive cuneiform. The\r\ninscribed cylinder-seals of Babylonia naturally appear along with them;\r\nalabaster vases, cups and bowls become common, and some of them are cut\r\ninto the forms of animals. Comparatively little pottery has been found\r\nin this stratum; but this is probably an accident.\r\n\r\nThe next stratum brings us to the period of Babylonian supremacy,\r\nwhen the viceroys of the Babylonian king ruled at Susa, and Semitic\r\ninfluence was already predominant in the Babylonian plain. It is\r\nthe age of Sargon of Akkad, and its commencement may approximately\r\nbe placed about B.C. 4000. The pottery still consists of\r\na yellow paste, though there are also many specimens of a coarse\r\nblack clay decorated with incrustations in white. The yellow ware is\r\noccasionally ornamented with mouldings of trees and other natural\r\nobjects. A typical vase of the period is one of globular shape and\r\nsmall rim, and with a moulded or incised rope-pattern running round\r\nthe centre and lower part of the rim. Another type is one which looks\r\nlike an inverted vase, with a series of rope-patterns encircling it,\r\nwhile another seems to have been copied from the pile of cylindrical\r\nvases into which, as into a drain, the body of the dead Babylonian\r\nwas inserted. These types of vase appear to have lasted, with\r\nlittle variation, down to the end of the Persian period, though,\r\nunfortunately, the disturbance of the ground and the consequent mixture\r\nof objects under the temple of In-Susinak, where the excavations\r\nwere carried on, makes certainty on the point unattainable. Immense\r\nquantities of bronze votive offerings, of all kinds and sorts,\r\nwere, however, found here, along with fragments of glass, and, as\r\ninscriptions show that they must all have been buried on the spot\r\nbefore the tenth century B.C., we have a time-limit for dating\r\nthe forms of the bronze weapons and tools.\r\n\r\nThe archæological evidence obtained at Susa has been supplemented by\r\nexcavations made some ninety miles to the west of it, at a place called\r\nMussian, on the eastern bank of the river Tib. Here there are graves,\r\nas well as the remains of a temple and houses with vaults, columns and\r\nwalls of burnt brick. Where the strata have allowed a section to be\r\ncut down to the virgin soil the results are found to agree with those\r\nrevealed by the excavations at Susa. The earliest layer belongs to the\r\nneolithic age, flint and obsidian, as at Susa, being the materials\r\nemployed for tools and weapons. The pottery is thick and hand-made,\r\nthe paste being either yellow or red in colour, and the surface is\r\noften polished, while many of the vases are furnished with holes for\r\nsuspension. This layer seems older than anything discovered at Susa. It\r\nis followed by a second layer, in which the pottery is wheel-made, and\r\nis decorated with animal and vegetable figures in black or red, like\r\nthe first prehistoric ware of the Susa mounds. Among the animal figures\r\nare those of men, and one fragment of yellow ware is ornamented with\r\nthe so-called swastika. In the upper part of the layer a few fragments\r\nof copper have been met with, indicating that the neolithic age was\r\nbeginning to pass into that of copper.\r\n\r\nAbove this layer is a third, characterized by a fine ware, usually\r\nyellow but sometimes greenish in colour, and decorated with designs\r\nin lustrous black. In the fine specimens the decoration has been laid\r\non before firing, in other cases after firing. The pottery as a whole\r\nhas a general resemblance to that of prehistoric Egypt. The culture\r\nrepresented by this layer was still neolithic, but objects of copper\r\nwere making their appearance, and the flint instruments of the past\r\nwere beginning to be superseded by metal, a knowledge of which appears\r\nto have come from abroad. With the introduction of copper the Elamite\r\nor historical epoch may be said to have begun. It was now that the\r\ntemple was first built of crude bricks, reeds taking the place of\r\nwood, and so pointing to the influence of Babylonia, where reeds were\r\nplentiful and wood was scarce.\r\n\r\nAnother proof of Babylonian influence must be seen not only in ware\r\nof Babylonian origin, but also in the figures of a nude goddess with\r\nthe hands placed upon the breasts, which originally represented the\r\ndivinity called Istar by the Semitic Babylonians. Indeed, from the\r\nfact that the goddess was represented in human form we may infer\r\nthat the figures, though first met with in the Sumerian age, were\r\nof Semitic derivation, and show that Sumerian culture was already\r\nbeing affected by the influence of Semitic religious ideas.[45] The\r\npottery found along with the figures is of a very varied description,\r\nincluding coarse red and fine yellow ware. Among the fine yellow ware\r\nare goblets with a tall cup supported on a foot. A typical form of\r\nthe yellow ware is the vase with angular sides; this, together with\r\nvases of more bulbous shape and terra-cotta stands, is remarkably like\r\nsome of the Egyptian Twelfth-dynasty pottery in form. The stands, more\r\nespecially, remind us of Twelfth-dynasty Egypt. There is also a black\r\nware decorated with incised lines which are filled in with white.\r\nThis black ware is also found in Egypt, where Professor Petrie is now\r\ninclined to associate it with the Hyksos. At all events it is absent\r\nthere during the interval that elapsed between the prehistoric period\r\nand the epoch of the Twelfth dynasty, and it characterizes the Hyksos\r\nsites of the Delta, while its foreign and non-Egyptian character has\r\nbeen recognized from the first. A few fragments of the same class of\r\npottery have been brought to light at Tello in Babylonia, where they\r\nwould appear to belong to the age of Gudea (B.C. 2700). One of\r\nthese formed part of a cylindrical vase or pyxis, identical in shape\r\nwith the black incised pyxides found at Susa at a depth of from five to\r\nten metres below the surface. On another fragment are spirited drawings\r\nof a water-bird, a fish seized by a gull, a four-footed animal, and\r\na boat with reeds growing behind it, each in a separate panel.[46]\r\nSimilar ware has been discovered in Southern Palestine, on the eastern\r\ncoast of Cyprus, in Spain and in the Greek islands. At Syros, for\r\ninstance, where it goes back to the neolithic age, it is associated\r\nwith alabaster vases, just as it is at Mussian. Here the bowls and\r\nvases of alabaster are strikingly Egyptian in form.\r\n\r\nThe clay figures of the Babylonian goddess testify to the same\r\nextension of culture in the copper age of Western Asia as do the black\r\nincised vases with their white fillings. M. Chantre has found them\r\nat Kara Eyuk in Cappadocia, on the borders of the Hittite region,\r\nthough in these the arms are no longer folded across the breast.\r\nFurther west I have lately shown[47] that the so-called figure of\r\nNiobê on Mount Sipylus in Lydia is a Hittite modification of them,\r\nand Dr. Schliemann discovered one of them, of lead, in the ruins of\r\nthe Second (prehistoric) city at Troy.[48] At Troy, however, the type\r\nwas more usually modified in the Hittite direction, as it was also\r\nin the islands of the Ægean, where marble figures of the goddess are\r\nplentiful.[49] In Egypt clay figures closely resembling those of\r\nBabylonia and Elam, but with the arms outstretched, have been met with\r\nfrom time to time at Karnak, and supposed to be dolls of the Roman\r\nperiod; but since the discovery by M. Legrain of remains which prove\r\nthat the history of Karnak reaches back to the prehistoric or early\r\ndynastic period, there is no longer any reason for not connecting them\r\nwith their analogues elsewhere. And the discoveries recently made by\r\nProfessor Pumpelly in the tumuli near Askabad, west of Khiva and Herat,\r\ngo far towards supporting the identification. Here the explorers have\r\nbrought to light two periods of neolithic culture, in the earlier of\r\nwhich no animals were as yet domesticated, and the pottery was of the\r\nrudest description. During the second period the domesticated animals\r\nwere introduced, including the horse and camel. Then came an age of\r\ncopper, accompanied by figurines representing the Babylonian goddess,\r\nsometimes with the arms outstretched, sometimes with them lying against\r\nthe sides, as in Cappadocia. The figurines are evidence that the art\r\nof working copper was derived from Babylonia, a conclusion which is\r\nconfirmed by M. Henri de Morgan’s excavations in the tumuli of Talîsh\r\nin Gîlân, on the south-western shore of the Caspian.[50]\r\n\r\nAs far back as our knowledge of Babylonian history extends the\r\ninhabitants of the country were acquainted with copper, and its use\r\nlasted century after century into quite recent times. Of a stone age,\r\nas I have already said, there is no clear trace. It is true that\r\nCaptain Cros has sunk shafts at Tello, and reached the virgin soil at\r\na depth of seventeen metres, finding there mace-heads of alabaster and\r\nhard stone similar to those of primitive Egypt, as well as other stone\r\nobjects; but no flint flakes were met with, and the pottery was similar\r\nto that of the higher strata.[51] On the other hand, objects of copper,\r\ngreat and small, including helmets and a colossal spear dedicated by a\r\nking of Kis, have been disinterred, though nothing of bronze has been\r\ndiscovered among the earlier remains, It was the same at Muqayyar, the\r\nancient Ur, as well as on the site of Eridu, where Taylor found only\r\ncopper bowls and the like in the graves, even in those of so late a\r\ndate as to contain objects of iron and an Egyptian scarab.[52] At\r\nNiffer, moreover, the ancient Nippur, American excavation has the\r\nsame tale to tell. According to Dr. Peters,[53] though iron knives,\r\nhatchets, spear-heads and arrow-heads have been exhumed, the date of\r\nwhich is said to be between 2000 and 1000 B.C., there is no\r\ntrace of bronze, the multitudinous objects, which further west would\r\nhave been of bronze, being here of copper. As at Ur, the copper age\r\nlasts down to the very end of the Babylonian kingdom. Hilprecht, on the\r\nauthority of Haynes, does indeed say[54] that in the very lowest strata\r\nof the temple mound, far below the pavements of Sargon and Naram-Sin\r\n(B.C. 3750), “fragments of copper, bronze and terra-cotta\r\nvessels” were disinterred. But no attempt seems to have been made to\r\nanalyze the so-called “bronze,” which may have been a natural alloy\r\nof copper with a small percentage of lead or antimony, and the age\r\nascribed to the fragments is rendered doubtful by the accompanying\r\nstatement, that “fragments of red and black lacquered pottery” were\r\ndiscovered in the same place which were indistinguishable from the red\r\nand black pottery of classical Greece. As yet, therefore, excavation in\r\nBabylonian lands has failed to tell us when the art of mixing tin with\r\nthe copper was discovered and copper was superseded by bronze.\r\n\r\nThis, however, had taken place before the commencement of the Assyrian\r\nage. The bronze scimitar of Hadad-nirari I. (B.C. 1330)[55]\r\nfinds an exact copy in a scimitar discovered by Mr. Macalister at Gezer\r\nin Palestine,[56] and the tools and weapons exhumed at Nineveh are of\r\nbronze and not copper. Analysis shows that the bronze usually consisted\r\nof about one part of tin to ten of copper, though for special objects\r\nlike bells the amount of tin was considerably increased.[57] When was\r\nit that the tin was first imported and intentionally mixed with the\r\ncopper in order to harden the metal?\r\n\r\nIn default of archæological evidence, the only possibility there is\r\nof discovering an answer to this question lies in an examination\r\nof the primitive pictures out of which the cuneiform characters\r\neventually developed. Here we are at once struck by a curious fact. The\r\n“determinative” attached to ideographs signifying “knife,” “weapon”\r\nand the like is not an ideograph which expresses the name of a metal;\r\nnor is it an ideograph denoting “stone,” but one which means “wood.”\r\nThat is to say, the material of which cutting instruments were made at\r\nthe time when the picture-writing of Babylonia came into existence was\r\nneither metal nor stone, but wood. That it should not have been stone\r\nis explained by the geology of the Babylonian plain, which consists of\r\nalluvial soil devoid of stones. That it should not have been of metal\r\ncan only mean that the inventors of the pictorial script were not yet\r\nacquainted with the use of copper, bronze or iron. In default of metal\r\nand stone they had to content themselves with hard wood.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, copper, as well as gold and silver, had become\r\nknown to them when the primitive pictographs were still in process of\r\nformation, and long before they had passed into cursive cuneiform.\r\nCopper was represented by the picture of an ingot or square plate of\r\nthe metal with a handle attached to it, showing that it was already\r\nin a fused and worked state when it was imported into Babylonia. Gold\r\nseems to have originally been denoted by the picture of a collar or\r\nnecklace, which signified “shining,” and was afterwards employed\r\nbefore the names of the precious metals. I have, however, never found\r\nthis collar actually used to signify “gold”; in the earliest texts\r\nyet discovered the phonetic syllable _gi_ is attached to it when\r\n“gold” is denoted, the Sumerian word for “gold” being _azag-gi_.\r\n“Silver” was “the white precious metal,” the symbol for “white” being\r\nattached to the picture of the collar, and so forming a compound\r\nideograph. This implies that silver became known to the inventors\r\nof the hieroglyphs at a later period than gold, though still before\r\nwhat I will call the cuneiform age. Even iron was known to them at\r\nthe same early epoch, and was expressed by ideographs which literally\r\nmean “stone of heaven,”[58] an indication that meteoric iron must be\r\nreferred to.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: HEAD OF ONE OF THE STATUES FROM TELLO.\r\n\r\n      [_See p. 73._]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n     VASE OF SILVER, DEDICATED TO NINGIRSU, BY ENTENA PATESI OF LAGAS.\r\n\r\n      [_See p. 58._]\r\n\r\nBut now comes a fact which is difficult to explain, so contrary is\r\nit to the archæological evidence. As we have seen, no traces of\r\nbronze have been found in the Assyro-Babylonian region before the\r\nbeginning of the Assyrian age--let us say about B.C. 2000.\r\nNevertheless, by the side of the simple ideograph which denotes the\r\nSumerian _urudu_, “copper”--_erû_ in Semitic Babylonian--we\r\nfind a compound ideograph signifying “bronze,” called _zabar_ in\r\nSumerian, from which the Semites borrowed their _’siparru_. It is\r\ntrue that it is a compound ideograph, but it occurs in the cuneiform\r\ntexts, not only in the era of Gudea (B.C. 2700), but even\r\nbefore the age of Sargon of Akkad (B.C. 3800). And an analysis\r\nof its earliest form seems to indicate that it really must have meant\r\nbronze from the first, and that consequently there was no transference\r\nof signification in later days. Literally it means “white copper,” the\r\nword for “copper” being phonetically-written _ka-mas_, with which\r\nthe Semitic Babylonian _kemassu_ is closely connected. Lead cannot\r\nbe intended, as that was denoted by a different word and different\r\nideographs, and I do not see what else “white copper” can be in\r\ncontradistinction to red copper except bronze. Polished copper could\r\nbe termed “bright,” but hardly “white.”[59]\r\n\r\nThe possibility remains that tin might have been the metal originally\r\ndenoted by the compound ideograph. If so, both the ideograph and\r\nthe words expressed by it had lost all reference to tin before the\r\nbeginning of the Assyrian period, and neither the Assyrian word for\r\n“tin” nor the Sumerian word, if any existed, is now known. Tin,\r\nmoreover, was archæologically late in making its appearance. The\r\nearliest examples of pure tin of which I know are of the time of the\r\nEighteenth Egyptian dynasty. On the other hand, bronze first appears in\r\nEgypt in the age of the Twelfth dynasty,[60] though it does not become\r\ncommon until the Hyksos predecessors of the Eighteenth dynasty had made\r\nthemselves masters of the valley of the Nile. From about B.C.\r\n1600 onwards, enormous quantities of it were employed in the eastern\r\nbasin of the Mediterranean and the adjoining lands, necessitating an\r\nequally large supply of tin. What the source of this tin may have been\r\nit is not my present purpose to inquire. But the persistence of the\r\ncopper age in Babylonia, as well as in the tumuli of Askabad, east\r\nof the Caspian, indicates that the manufacture of bronze must have\r\nmigrated from the north-west to the Babylonian plain. We find it first\r\nin Assyria, not in Babylonia, and it may well be that the Assyrians\r\nderived it from Armenia and the population of Cappadocia, where, as I\r\nshall show in a subsequent chapter, they had established colonies at an\r\nearly period. At all events, the earliest examples of bronze yet met\r\nwith were discovered by Dr. Schliemann in the Second prehistoric city\r\nat Troy.\r\n\r\nIt was to this region that classical tradition referred the origin of\r\nworking in iron. An analysis of the gold of the first six Egyptian\r\ndynasties submitted to Dr. Gladstone by Professor Petrie proved that\r\nit was mixed with silver, and hence must have been derived from Asia\r\nMinor.[61] Egyptian legend made “the followers of Horus,” who founded\r\ndynastic Egypt, metallurgists and smiths whose metal weapons enabled\r\nthem to subdue the older neolithic population. The story as it has come\r\ndown to us declares the smiths to have been workers in iron; iron,\r\nhowever, must be the substitute of the later version of the story for\r\nsome other metal, since, though Vyse claims to have discovered an iron\r\nclamp in the great pyramid of Giza,[62] and Petrie has found a mass of\r\niron in a Sixth-dynasty deposit in the temple of Osiris at Abydos,[63]\r\nironsmiths can hardly have existed in the pre-dynastic age. It is\r\nprobable, therefore, that copper was the metal which the dynastic\r\nEgyptians introduced into their new home, and which was already in use\r\nin Babylonia. But the intercourse with Asia Minor, which the gold of\r\nthe First dynasty indicates must even then have been going on, makes it\r\npossible that it was from this quarter of the world that the earliest\r\nknowledge of the manufacture of bronze was brought to the valley of\r\nthe Nile. Even in the time of the Twelfth dynasty, however, the tools\r\nfound by Professor Petrie in the workmen’s huts at Kahûn are of copper\r\nrather than of bronze.[64] The colossal statue of King Pepi of the\r\nSixth dynasty, discovered at Hierakonpolis, is of hammered copper, and\r\nwe have to wait for the advent of the Eighteenth dynasty before bronze\r\nbecomes the predominant metal.\r\n\r\nThat such was the case points to the Hyksos period as that in which\r\nbronze succeeded in superseding the older copper. It may be that the\r\nHyksos brought the extended use of it with them from Syria. In Southern\r\nPalestine, Mr. Macalister’s excavations at Gezer have shown that bronze\r\nrather than copper was largely employed throughout the so-called\r\nAmorite period, which went back to an earlier age than that of the\r\nTwelfth dynasty, and it is just here that in the time of the Eighteenth\r\ndynasty bronze itself began to make way for iron. Mr. J. L. Myres\r\nhas recently traced the polychrome pottery of Southern Canaan to the\r\nHittite lands of Cappadocia,[65] where the red ochre was found by which\r\nit was characterized, and a knowledge of bronze may have travelled\r\nalong the same road.\r\n\r\nBut these are speculations which may or may not be verified by future\r\nresearch. For the present we must be content with the fact that, in\r\nspite of the philological evidence to the contrary, copper, and not\r\nbronze, was the metal which preceded the use of iron in Babylonia,\r\nwhereas in the northern kingdom of Assyria bronze was already known at\r\na comparatively early date. So far as the existing evidence can carry\r\nus, it seems to indicate that Babylonia was the primitive home of the\r\ncopper industry, while bronze, on the other hand, made its way eastward\r\nfrom Asia Minor and the north of Syria. Where bronze was first invented\r\nis still unknown to us; all that seems certain is that it must have\r\nbeen in a land where copper and tin are found together.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTE\r\n\r\nAccording to the mineralogists, in the western part of the northern\r\nhemisphere tin is found only in Britain, Spain and the neighbourhood\r\nof Askabad, the scanty surface-tin of Saxony, France and Tuscany being\r\ntoo poor and insignificant to have attracted attention in antiquity\r\n(see de Morgan, _Mission Scientifique au Caucase_, ii. pp. 16–28).\r\nThe American excavations at Askabad under Professor Pumpelly appear to\r\nhave made it clear that bronze was not invented in that part of the\r\nworld, or indeed used in early days, and we are thus thrown back on\r\nBritain and Spain. It is quite certain, however, that bronze made its\r\nway to the west of Europe from the east, and the Hon. John Abercromby\r\nhas proved (_Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, xxxii. pp.\r\n375–94, and _Proceedings of Society of Antiquaries of Scotland_,\r\n1903–4, pp. 323–410) that the bronze culture came to this country from\r\nthe valley of the central Rhine where it cuts the river at Mayence. On\r\nthe other hand, the bronze-age civilization of the Danube valley, the\r\nBalkan peninsula and Italy forms a whole with that of the south-eastern\r\nbasin of the Mediterranean, which again is closely connected with\r\nthe bronze-age culture of the Ægean, Asia Minor and Egypt, while the\r\ncivilization of the Danube valley leads on to that of Central Europe\r\nand, to a less extent, of Scandinavia and Northern Germany. Montelius\r\n(_Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, 1900, pp. 89\r\n_sqq._) has pointed out that the early bronze culture of Northern\r\nItaly was carried to Scandinavia along the route of the amber trade as\r\nfar back as the close of the neolithic age in Sweden, and the numerous\r\nobjects of Irish gold found in Scandinavia--though, it is true, of\r\nsomewhat later date--show that commercial relations must have existed\r\nbetween the British Islands and the Scandinavian peninsula. Tin might\r\nhave followed the gold route until it met the amber route, by which it\r\nwould have been carried southward to Central Europe and the Adriatic.\r\n\r\nIn Western Europe the sword, like the socketed celt, is first met\r\nwith in the third and last period into which the bronze age has been\r\ndivided. The earliest examples of the sword, in fact, are those\r\ndiscovered at Mykenæ, which belong to the age of the Eighteenth\r\nEgyptian dynasty. Schliemann found only the dirk at Troy, and, so far\r\nas our present evidence goes, the dirk alone was used by the Hittites\r\nand Proto-Armenians down to the seventh century B.C. The\r\nscimitar, however, was known in Assyria and at Gezer at least as early\r\nas the fourteenth century B.C. (see p. 57 above), and in\r\nCyprus the sword makes its appearance along with the knife and fibula\r\nin the later bronze age after the close of the age of copper. Similarly\r\nin Krete it was only in tombs of the Late Mykenæan (or Late Minoan)\r\nperiod that the cemetery of Knossos yielded swords of bronze (_Annual\r\nof the British School at Athens_, x. p. 4). The dirk of the copper\r\nage was stanged as at Troy and in the Danube valley, the Cyprian and\r\nHungarian forms being practically identical. From the Danube valley the\r\nstanged spear-head passed to Western Europe during the second period\r\nof the bronze age. The fibula is not found at Troy, where the early\r\nbronze age will have corresponded with the copper age of Cyprus.\r\n\r\nAll this goes to show (1) that the scimitar--the _harpê_ of\r\nthe Perseus myth--was a Semitic invention, while the long sword was\r\nof European origin; (2) that at Troy, and possibly also in Southern\r\nPalestine, to which Hittite polychrome pottery was carried at an early\r\ndate, bronze was known at a time when only copper was used in Cyprus\r\nand Egypt; and (3) that the characteristic weapon of this primitive\r\nbronze age was the dirk, which continued to characterize Asia Minor\r\nlong after the sword and scimitar had been invented elsewhere. Taken\r\nin connection with the fact that the pottery and decorative designs\r\nof Asia Minor can be linked with those of the Balkan peninsula and\r\nthe valley of the Danube, we may provisionally conclude that Northern\r\nAsia Minor was the home of the invention of bronze. Against this is\r\nthe fact that no tin has hitherto been found there, and we should\r\naccordingly have to explain the origin of bronze by the theory that\r\nafter the discovery of various processes for hardening copper, further\r\nexperiments were made with imported tin. Unfortunately, neither the\r\nsouth of Cornwall nor Asia Minor, with the exception of the Troad, has\r\nas yet been scientifically explored from an archæological point of\r\nview. But it deserves mention that the curious needles with a double\r\nhead of twisted wire, which are met with among the remains of the\r\nbronze age in Britain, are characteristic of the copper age in Cyprus\r\nand of the early bronze age at Troy.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER III\r\n\r\n                             THE SUMERIANS\r\n\r\n\r\nAmong the first results of the decipherment of the Assyrian cuneiform\r\ninscriptions was one which was so unexpected and revolutionary, that\r\nit was received with incredulity and employed to pour discredit on\r\nthe fact of the decipherment itself. European scholars had long been\r\nnursing the comfortable belief that the white race primarily, and\r\nthe natives of Europe secondarily, were _ipso facto_ superior\r\nto the rest of mankind, and that to them belonged of right the\r\norigin and development of civilization. The discovery of the common\r\nparentage of the Indo-European languages had come to strengthen the\r\nbelief; the notion grew up that in Sanskrit we had found, if not the\r\nprimeval language, at all events a language that was very near to it,\r\nand idyllic pictures were painted of the primitive Aryan community\r\nliving in its Asiatic home and already possessed of the elements of\r\nits later culture. Outside and beyond it were the barbarians, races\r\nyellow and brown and black, with oblique eyes and narrow foreheads,\r\nwhose intelligence was not much above that of the brute beasts. Such\r\nculture as some of them may have had was derived from the white race,\r\nand perhaps spoilt in the borrowing. The idea of the rise of a\r\ncivilization outside the limits of the white race was regarded as a\r\nparadox.\r\n\r\nIt was just this paradox to which the first decipherers of Assyrian\r\ncuneiform found themselves forced. And another paradox was added to it.\r\nNot only had the civilization of the Euphrates and Tigris originated\r\namongst a race that spoke an agglutinative language, and therefore was\r\nneither Aryan nor Semitic, the civilization of the Semitic Babylonians\r\nand Assyrians was borrowed from this older civilization along with the\r\ncuneiform system of writing. It seemed impossible that so revolutionary\r\na doctrine could be true, and Semitic philologists naturally denounced\r\nit. For centuries Hebrew had been supposed to have been the language\r\nof Paradise, and the old belief which made the Semitic Adam the first\r\ncivilized man still unconsciously affected the Semitic scholars of the\r\nnineteenth century. It was hard to part with the prejudices of early\r\neducation, especially when they were called upon to do so by a small\r\ngroup of men whose method of decipherment was an enigma to the ordinary\r\ngrammarian, and who were introducing new and dangerous principles into\r\nthe study of the extinct Semitic tongues.\r\n\r\nThe method of decipherment was nevertheless a sound one, and the\r\nresult, which seemed so incredible and impossible when first announced,\r\nis now one of the assured facts of science. The first civilized\r\noccupants of the alluvial plain of Babylonia were neither Semites nor\r\nAryans, but the speakers of an agglutinative language, and to them\r\nwere due all the elements of the Babylonian culture of later days. It\r\nwas they who first drained the marshes, and regulated the course of\r\nthe rivers by canals, thereby transforming what had been a pestiferous\r\nswamp into the most fertile of lands; it was they who founded the\r\ngreat cities of the country, and invented the pictorial characters,\r\nthe cursive forms of which became what we term cuneiform. The theology\r\nand law of later Babylonia went back to them, and long after Semitic\r\nBabylonian had become the language of the country, legal judgments were\r\nstill written in the old language and the theological literature was\r\nstill studied in it. The Church and the Law were as loth to give up the\r\ndead language of Sumer as they were in modern Europe to give up the use\r\nof Latin.\r\n\r\nThis dead agglutinative language has been called sometimes Akkadian,\r\nsometimes Sumerian, but Sumerian is the name which has been finally\r\nselected. In fact, this was the name applied to it by the Semitic\r\nBabylonians themselves, who included in the term the two dialects--or\r\nrather the two forms of the language at different periods of its\r\ndevelopment--which have been preserved to us in the cuneiform tablets.\r\nStrictly speaking, the dialect which had been most affected by contact\r\nwith the Semites, and had in consequence suffered most from phonetic\r\ndecay, was known as the language of Akkad, but this was because Akkad\r\nrepresented Northern Babylonia, which had become Semitic at an earlier\r\ndate than the south and had been the seat of the first great Semitic\r\nEmpire.[66] Both names, Akkadian and Sumerian, are correct as applied\r\nto the primitive language of Chaldæa, but of the two Sumerian is\r\npreferable, not only because it was used by the Babylonian scribes\r\nthemselves, but also because it denoted the oldest and purest form of\r\nthe language before it had passed under foreign influence.\r\n\r\nThis, then, was the great archæological fact which resulted from the\r\ndecipherment of the Assyro-Babylonian texts. The earliest civilized\r\ninhabitants of Babylonia did not speak a Semitic language, and\r\ntherefore presumably they were not Semites. It is perfectly true that\r\nlanguage and race are not synonymous terms, and that we are seldom\r\njustified in arguing from the one to the other. But the Sumerian\r\nlanguage is one of the exceptions which proves the rule. Those who\r\nspoke it were the first civilizers of Western Asia, the inventors and\r\nperfecters of a system of writing which was destined to be one of\r\nthe chief humanizing agents of the ancient world, the authors of the\r\nirrigation engineering of the Babylonian plain, and the builders of\r\nits many cities. The language they spoke, accordingly, could not have\r\nbeen forced upon them by conquerors who have otherwise left no trace\r\nbehind them, and they certainly would not have exchanged it of their\r\nown accord for their native tongue. The Semitic languages have always\r\nbeen conspicuous for the tenacity with which they have held their own,\r\nand the conservatism with which they have resisted change. We may still\r\nhear in the Egyptian Arabic of to-day the very words which were written\r\nby Semitic Babylonian scribes upon their tablets some four or five\r\nthousand years ago. A Semitic people would have been the last to borrow\r\nthe language of its less-civilized neighbours without any assignable\r\nreason. The fact, consequently, that the pioneers of Babylonian culture\r\nspoke an agglutinative language fully justifies us in concluding that\r\nthey belonged to a race that was not Semitic.\r\n\r\nSumerian, however, was not the only language in the neighbourhood of\r\nthe Babylonian plain which was agglutinative. Further to the east,\r\nin the highlands of Elam, other agglutinative languages were spoken,\r\nmonuments of one or more of which have been preserved to us. Whether or\r\nnot the agglutinative languages of Elam were related to the Sumerian\r\nof Babylonia, I cannot tell; so far as our materials go at present\r\nthey do not warrant us in saying more than that, like Sumerian, they\r\nwere of the agglutinative type. It is only rarely that the scientific\r\nphilologist is able to separate some of the multitudinous languages of\r\nthe globe into genealogically related groups; for the most part they\r\nstand isolated and apart from one another, and, however much we may\r\nwish to group them together, it is seldom that we find such proofs of\r\na common descent as will satisfy the requirements of science. Families\r\nof speech--or at all events such as can be scientifically proved to be\r\nso--are the exception and not the rule.\r\n\r\nEastward of Sumer the type of language was thus agglutinative, as it\r\nwas in Sumer itself. And in the days when civilization first grew up\r\nthere, there is no sign or trace of the languages we call inflectional.\r\nThe speakers of Aryan dialects, whom we find in classical times in\r\nMedia or Persia or North-Western India, belong to a later epoch; the\r\nold belief in the Asiatic cradle of the Aryan tongues has long since\r\nbeen given up by the anthropologist and comparative philologist,[67]\r\nand it is recognized that if we are to look for it anywhere it must\r\nbe in Eastern Europe. The Semitic languages are equally absent; the\r\ntide of Semitic speech which eventually overflowed Babylonia, surged\r\nnorthward and eastward into Assyria and Elam, but never succeeded in\r\npassing Susiana, and was finally driven again from the ground it had\r\nonce gained there. The home of the Semite lay to the west and not to\r\nthe east of the Babylonian plain. Babylonian culture owed its origin to\r\na race whose type of language was that of the Finn, of the Magyar or\r\nthe Japanese.\r\n\r\nThe physical characteristics of this race cannot as yet be fully\r\ndetermined. The oldest sculptures yielded by Babylonian excavation\r\nbelong to a time when the Semite was already in the land. It might\r\nbe supposed that the early monuments of Tello, which were erected by\r\nSumerian princes and go back to Sumerian times, would give us the\r\nnecessary materials; but not only are they too rude and infantile\r\nto be of scientific use, they also indicate the existence of two\r\nethnological types, one heavily bearded, the other beardless, with\r\noblique eyes and negrito-like face. It is not until we come to the\r\nage of Semitic domination that sculpture is sufficiently realistic\r\nfor exact anthropological purposes. At the same time, there was to\r\nthe last a marked contrast of both form and feature in the artistic\r\nrepresentation of the Babylonian and his more purely Semitic Assyrian\r\nneighbour. The squat, thick figure, the full, well-shaven cheeks, the\r\nlarge, almond-shaped eyes and round head of King Merodach-nadin-akhi in\r\nthe twelfth century B.C. still reproduce the characteristic\r\nform and features of the statues found in the palace of Gudea, the\r\nSumerian high-priest of Lagas, who lived more than a thousand years\r\nbefore. The aquiline or hooked nose, the thick lips and muscular limbs\r\nwhich distinguished the Assyrian are generally wanting in Babylonia.\r\nAnd, on the other hand, there is a likeness between the Babylonian\r\nas he is portrayed on the monuments and the Elamite adversaries of\r\nAssur-bani-pal, some of whom, it is noticeable, are depicted with\r\nbeards, though the excavations of Dieulafoy and de Morgan at Susa\r\nhave shown (according to Quatrefages and Hamy) that a beardless and\r\nshort-nosed negrito type with round heads was aboriginal in Elam. The\r\nsame type is reproduced in one of the heads found at Tello, and M.\r\nde Morgan has pointed out that similar brachycephalic and beardless\r\nnegritos are represented on the monuments of Naram-Sin as serving in\r\nthe army of Akkad.[68] We may conclude, therefore, that they still\r\nformed a part of the population of Northern Babylonia even in the age\r\nwhen it had passed completely under Semitic rule. Indeed, Dr. Pinches\r\nhas shown that the pure Semitic type is not depicted in Babylonian art,\r\noutside the kingdom of Akkad, “before the time of the First dynasty of\r\nBabylon, which began to reign about B.C. 2300.”\r\n\r\nIt has often been maintained that the Sumerians themselves were an\r\nimmigrant people, who had descended from the mountains of Elam. There\r\nis nothing unreasonable in the supposition; it was always difficult\r\nto prevent the mountaineers of Elam from making raids in Babylonia,\r\nand one of their tribes succeeded in settling in the country and\r\nestablishing at Babylon one of the longest-lived of its dynasties. But\r\nthe supposition mainly rests upon two facts. The pictorial hieroglyphs\r\nout of which the cuneiform characters have developed had no special\r\nsign for “river,” while the same character represented both “mountain”\r\nand “country.” It would seem, therefore, that the land in which the\r\ncuneiform system of writing was first invented was just the converse of\r\nthe Babylonian plain, being at once mountainous and riverless. That the\r\nsame character means both “mountain” and “country” is no doubt a strong\r\nargument in favour of the Elamite origin of Babylonian civilization.\r\nThat the use of the primitive hieroglyphs should have survived in Elam\r\nwhile it was lost in Babylonia, as M. de Morgan’s discoveries have\r\nshown to be the case, is also another fact which may perhaps be claimed\r\non the same side; at any rate it indicates that they were known to the\r\nElamites before the cursive cuneiform had developed out of them. But\r\nthe want of a special character for “river” is not so decisive as it\r\nappears at first sight to be. The word “river” is represented by two\r\nideographic signs which literally signify “the watery deep,” and so\r\npoint to the fact that those who originally invented them lived not in\r\nthe highlands of the East, but on the shores of that Persian Gulf which\r\nthe Babylonians of the historic period still called “the deep.” As it\r\nwas also known as “the salt river,” it is not difficult to understand\r\nhow, to those whose experience of navigable water had been confined\r\nto the Persian Gulf, the Tigris and Euphrates would have seemed but\r\nrepetitions of the Gulf on a smaller scale.[69]\r\n\r\nThe rise of Sumerian culture on the shores of the Persian Gulf is in\r\naccordance with Babylonian tradition. Babylonian myths told how Oannes\r\nor Ea, the god of culture, had risen each morning out of his palace\r\nin “the deep,” bringing with him the elements of civilization which\r\nhe communicated to mankind. Letters, science and art had all been\r\nhis gifts. He had instructed the wild tribes of the coast to build\r\nhouses and erect temples; he had compiled for them the first law-book,\r\nand had instructed them in the mysteries of agriculture. Babylonian\r\ncivilization was sea-born. The system of cosmology which finally won\r\nits way to acceptance with the priesthood and philosophers of Babylonia\r\nwas one which had been first conceived at Eridu, the site of which is\r\nnow more than a hundred miles distant from the sea, but in the early\r\ndays of Babylonian history, before the silting up of the shore, had\r\nbeen its seaport. Here the first man Adam[70] was supposed to have\r\nlived, and to have spent his time fishing in the waters of the Gulf.\r\nThe whole earth was believed to have grown out of a primeval deep like\r\nthe mud-flats which the inhabitants of Eridu saw slowly emerging from\r\nthe retreating sea. Philosophy and cosmology, with the theology with\r\nwhich they were associated, looked back upon Eridu and the Babylonian\r\ncoast as their primeval home.[71]\r\n\r\nIn fact the physical conditions of the Babylonian plain rendered it\r\nimpossible for the first culture of the country to have sprung up in\r\nit. Before it was reclaimed by engineering skill and labour the larger\r\npart of it had been a pestiferous marsh. The science needed for making\r\nit habitable, at least by civilized man, must have arisen outside its\r\nboundaries. Only when he was already armed with a civilization which\r\nenabled him to dig canals, to mould bricks, and pile his houses and\r\ntemples on artificial foundations could the Sumerian have settled in\r\nthe Babylonian plain and there developed it still further. The cities\r\nof the plain grew up each round its sanctuary, which became a centre of\r\ncivilization and progress, of agriculture and trade. But the builders\r\nof the sanctuaries must have brought their culture with them from\r\nelsewhere.\r\n\r\nOf these sanctuaries the most venerable was that of Bel the Elder at\r\nNippur. It has been systematically excavated by the Americans down to\r\nits foundations, and the successive strata of its history laid bare.\r\nInscribed objects have been found in all the strata, carrying the\r\nhistory of the cuneiform system of writing back to the days when the\r\ntemple was originally built. But it is still the cuneiform system of\r\nwriting as far back as we can go, that is to say the characters are the\r\ncursive forms of earlier hieroglyphic pictures, the features of which\r\nare in most cases scarcely traceable. Here and there, it is true, the\r\nprimitive pictorial form has been preserved, but this is the exception\r\nand not the rule. As a rule the earliest writing found at Nippur, and\r\ncoeval with the foundation of its temple, is already the degenerated\r\nand cursive hand which we call cuneiform.\r\n\r\nThe fact is very noteworthy. The cuneiform characters have assumed the\r\nshapes which give them their name owing to their having been inscribed\r\non clay by a stylus of wood or metal, which obliged the writer to\r\nsubstitute a series of wedge-like indentations for curves and straight\r\nlines. As time went on, the number of the wedges was reduced, the forms\r\nof the characters were simplified, and the resemblance to the pictures\r\nthey were once intended to represent became more and more indistinct.\r\nThe cuneiform script is, in short, a running hand, like the hieratic\r\nof Egypt. But whereas in Egypt the hieratic running hand does not\r\ncome into common use until long after the beginning of the monumental\r\nperiod, while the pictorial hieroglyphs continued to be employed to\r\nthe last, in Babylonia the cuneiform running hand has superseded the\r\nprimeval pictures as far back as our records carry us. When the temple\r\nof Nippur was built--and it was probably one of the first, if not the\r\nfirst, to be built in the Babylonian plain--the clay tablet was already\r\nin use for writing purposes, and the cursive cuneiform had taken the\r\nplace of the older hieroglyphs.\r\n\r\nThe Babylonian plain was called by its Sumerian inhabitants the Edin,\r\nor “Plain,” a name which was borrowed by the Semites and has been made\r\nfamiliar to us by the book of Genesis. Originally it had meant all\r\nthe uncultivated flats on either side of the Euphrates, but it soon\r\nacquired the sense of the country as opposed to the city, and so of the\r\ncultivated plain itself. Most of the important Babylonian cities were\r\nbuilt in it between the Euphrates on the west and the Tigris on the\r\neast. A few only lay beyond it on the western bank of the Euphrates.\r\nOne of these was Eridu, another was Ur, a third was Borsippa.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n      THE TELL OF BORSIPPA, THE PRESENT BIRS-NIMRUD.]\r\n\r\nOf Eridu I have already spoken. Some six or eight thousand years\r\nago it was the seaport of primitive Babylonia.[72] Ur, which stood\r\nclose to it, seems to have been a colony of Nippur, and therefore of\r\ncomparatively late origin.[73] Borsippa was a small and unimportant\r\ntown, which eventually became a suburb of Babylon, and Babylon, on\r\nthe eastern bank of the Euphrates, was itself a colony of Eridu.[74]\r\nHence of the cities which stood outside the Edin of Babylonia, and may\r\ntherefore belong to an age when Babylonian civilization was still in\r\nits infancy, Eridu alone is of account. And the priority even of Eridu\r\nwas contested. Traditionally Sippara, which is expressly stated to have\r\nbeen in “the Edin,” claimed to be the oldest of Babylonian cities; one\r\nquarter of it bore the name of “Sippara that is from everlasting,” and\r\nlike Eridu, it believed itself to have been the abode of the first\r\nman.[75] Thus far, however, the monuments have given us nothing to\r\nsubstantiate the claim; the culture-god of Babylonia was Ea of Eridu,\r\nnot the Sun-god of Sippara, and for the present, therefore, we must\r\nlook to the shore of the Persian Gulf, rather than to the “land of\r\nEden” for the cradle of Babylonian civilization.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, both Sippara and Eridu were of Sumerian foundation, as\r\nindeed were nearly all the great cities of Babylonia. Eridu was a later\r\nform of the older Eri-dugga, “the good city,” a name which seems to\r\nhave been the starting-point of more than one legend. The growth of the\r\ncoast to the south of it gives us some idea as to the age to which its\r\nfoundation must reach back.\r\n\r\nIt was, as I have said, the primitive seaport of Babylonia, and its\r\nlegend of the first man Adamu made him a fisherman in the Persian Gulf.\r\nIts site is now rather more than a hundred miles distant from the\r\npresent line of coast. The progress of alluvial deposit brought down by\r\nthe Euphrates and Tigris can be estimated by the fact that forty-seven\r\nmiles of it have been formed since Spasinus Charax, the modern\r\nMohammerah, was built in the age of Alexander the Great, and was for a\r\ntime the port of Chaldæa. During the last 2000 years, accordingly, the\r\nrate of deposit would seem to have been about 115 feet a year. This,\r\nhowever, does not agree with the observations of Loftus, who made the\r\nrate not more than a mile in every seventy years,[76] while on the\r\nother hand Sir Henry Rawlinson adduced reasons for believing it to have\r\nbeen more rapid in the past than it is to-day, and that consequently\r\nthe rate must once have been as much as a mile in thirty years.[77] It\r\nis desirable that some competent geologist should study the question\r\non the spot. Taking, however, as a basis of calculation, the one known\r\nfact of the rate of growth since the foundation of Spasinus Charax, and\r\nbearing in mind that before the junction of the Tigris and Euphrates\r\nthe rate of advance must have been comparatively slow, we should have\r\nto go back to about B.C. 5000 as the latest date at which\r\nEridu could still have been the seaport of the country.\r\n\r\nWas it here that the system of writing which was so closely entwined\r\nwith the origin of Babylonian civilization was first invented?\r\nBabylonian tradition in later days certainly believed that such was the\r\ncase, and the fact that Ea of Eridu was the culture-god of Babylonia\r\nis strongly in its favour. But there are difficulties in the way.\r\nEridu was the home of the “white witchcraft” of early Chaldæa; it was\r\nhere that the charms and incantations were composed which gave the\r\npriesthood of Eridu its influence, and made the god they worshipped\r\nthe impersonation of wisdom. The belief that he was the originator of\r\nBabylonian culture may have had its source in the system of magic which\r\nwas associated with his name. Eridu was built on the Semitic side of\r\nthe Euphrates, and the Semitic tribes who received their letters and\r\ntheir civilization from the Sumerians of Eridu would naturally have\r\nlooked upon the city of their teachers as the primeval home of Sumerian\r\nculture. The traditions that made Eridu the starting-point of Sumerian\r\ncivilization could thus be explained away, and we should be left free\r\nto settle the question of its origin upon purely archæological evidence.\r\n\r\nUnfortunately the site of Eridu has not yet been systematically\r\nexcavated. Once again the archæological materials for settling an\r\narchæological question are not at hand, and we are thrown back upon an\r\nexamination of the picture-writing from which the cuneiform characters\r\nare derived. Here the evidence on the whole may be said to be in\r\nfavour of tradition. It is true that there is no special ideograph for\r\n“river,” but there is one for “the deep,” and “the spirit of the deep”\r\nmust have been a chief object of worship at the time when the primitive\r\nhieroglyphs were first formed. The “ship,” too, played a prominent\r\npart in the life of their inventors, and the picture of it represented\r\nit as moved not by oars but by a sail.[78] The flowering reed was\r\nequally prominent, and was even used to symbolize what stood firm and\r\nestablished.[79] Houses, fortresses, temples, and cities were built of\r\nbrick, and vases were moulded out of clay.[80] The tablet, rectangular\r\nor square, was already employed for the purpose of writing, but as it\r\nwas provided with a handle or a couple of rings at the top, I think\r\nit was more probably of wood than of clay. The sheep, goat and ox were\r\ndomesticated,[81] and so also probably was the ass,[82] and corn was\r\ncultivated in the fields. The symbol of the “earth” appears to have\r\nbeen the picture of an island of circular or elliptical form. Among\r\ntrees the cedar was well known.\r\n\r\nAll this points to the sea-coast of Babylonia as the district in which\r\nits civilization first arose. But on the other hand, there is the fact\r\nthat “country” and “mountain” are alike represented by the picture of\r\na mountainous land. There is also the fact that the land in which the\r\ninventors of the hieroglyphs lived was one in which copper, gold and\r\nsilver were procurable--perhaps also meteoric iron; and the further\r\nfact that hard wood was sufficiently plentiful for tools or weapons to\r\nhave been made of it before the employment of metal. That they should\r\nhave been made of wood, however, and not of stone, is a strong argument\r\nin favour of the Babylonian coast.\r\n\r\nIt is on wood, moreover, that the first hieroglyphs must have been\r\npainted or cut. Many of them represented round objects or were\r\nformed of curved lines, which were transformed into a series of\r\nwedge-like indentations when imprinted by a stylus upon clay. We\r\nknow, therefore, that clay was not the original writing material;\r\nits use as such, in fact, is coeval with the rise of that cursive\r\nscript which, in the case of the Egyptian hieroglyphics, is called\r\nhieratic, but in Assyro-Babylonian is known as cuneiform. It was the\r\nattempt to reproduce the old pictures upon clay that created the\r\ncuneiform characters. As metal is not likely to have been employed\r\nby the primitive scribes of Chaldæa, and there is no trace of stone\r\nhaving been used--even the stone cylinder of later days being called\r\na _dup-sar_ or “written tablet”--we are left to choose between\r\nwood and papyrus. In favour of papyrus is the fact that the circular\r\nforms of so many of the pictures suggest that they were originally\r\npainted rather than engraved; on the other hand, it is doubtful whether\r\nthe papyrus grows in the Babylonian rivers, or at any rate did so\r\nin the prehistoric age. And the pictograph of a “written document”\r\nis not a strip or roll of papyrus, as in Egypt, but a tablet with a\r\nhandle or loop. It is true that the primeval picture which denoted\r\n“copper” has much the same form, but as even cutting instruments had\r\nthe determinative of “wood” attached to them in the early picture\r\nwriting, it is clear that the original tablet could not have been of\r\nmetal, whatever might have been the case with its later successors.\r\nThe picture, moreover, of the “tablet” is distinguished from that of\r\na “plate of bronze” by the addition of a string which is tied to the\r\nhandle.\r\n\r\nOn the whole, therefore, the only archæological evidence available at\r\npresent is on the side of the tradition which made Babylonian culture\r\nmove northward from the coast. The only fact against it of which I know\r\nis that, as I have already stated, the word for land was symbolized by\r\nthe picture of a triple mountain. But this fact is not insuperable.\r\nBefore the silting up of the shore, the old coast-line of Babylonia\r\nwould have stretched away north-eastward of Eridu towards the mountains\r\nof Elam. Whether the mountains that fringed what would then have been\r\nthe eastern coast of the Persian Gulf are visible from the site of\r\nEridu, I do not know; if the clear light of Upper Egypt exists there\r\nthey would be so. Nor do I know whether on the western side there\r\nare mountain ranges visible in Arabia; these are points which can be\r\ncleared up only when the country has been thoroughly explored.\r\n\r\nEridu lay five miles southward of Ur,[83] that “Ur of the Chaldees”\r\nfrom which Hebrew history affirmed the ancestor of the nation had\r\ncome. Ur was never a maritime port like Eridu; it stood on the Arabian\r\nplateau and looked towards the west. Its face was turned to the Semitic\r\nrather than to the Sumerian world. From the first, therefore, it must\r\nhave been in touch with Semitic tribes. And a curious reminiscence\r\nof the fact survived in the western Semitic languages, Ur or Uru\r\nsignifies “the city”; it was a Sumerian word, another form of which was\r\n_eri_. The word was borrowed by the Semites, and in the Hebrew\r\nof the Old Testament, accordingly, the idea of “city” is expressed by\r\n_’îr_. The Assyrians of the north, whose vocabulary was otherwise\r\nso full of Sumerian loan-words, preferred the native _âlu_, “a\r\ntent,” to which the meaning of “city” was assigned when Sumerian\r\nculture had been passed on to the Semitic race and the tent had been\r\nexchanged for the city. The history of the word is a history of early\r\nculture as well.\r\n\r\nBut I am far from saying that it was through Ur that the civilization\r\nof Sumer came to be handed on to its Semitic neighbours. On the\r\ncontrary, such facts as there are point in a different direction.\r\nWestern Semites, whom linguistically we may call Arabs or Aramæans, or\r\nCanaanites or Hebrews, doubtless mingled with the Sumerian population\r\nof Ur, and adopted more or less of its manners and civilization, but it\r\nwas further north, in the Babylonian Eden itself, that the Semite first\r\ncame under the influence of the higher culture, and soon outstripped\r\nhis masters in the arts of life.\r\n\r\nThe entrance of the Semitic element into Babylonia is at present one of\r\nthe most obscure of problems. All we can be sure of are certain main\r\nfacts. First of all, as we have seen, the early culture of Babylonia,\r\nincluding so integral a part of it as the script, was of Sumerian\r\norigin. So, too, were the great cities and sanctuaries of the country,\r\nas well as the system of irrigation engineering which first made it\r\nhabitable. Sumerian long continued to be the language of theology and\r\nlaw; indeed a large part of the Babylonian pantheon of later days\r\nwas frankly non-Semitic. As was inevitable under such conditions,\r\nthe Assyrian language contained an immense number of words--many of\r\nthem compound--which were borrowed from the older language, and its\r\nidioms and grammar equally showed signs of Sumerian influence. I have\r\nsometimes been tempted, from a scientific point of view, to speak of\r\nSemitic Babylonian as a mixed language.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, if the elements of Babylonian civilization were\r\nSumerian, the superstructure was Semitic. When the Semites entered into\r\nthe heritage of Sumerian culture, the cuneiform script must have still\r\nbeen in a very inchoate and immature state. Its pictorial ancestry must\r\nstill have been clear, and no scruples were felt about altering or\r\nadding to the characters. The phonetic application of the characters,\r\nwhich was still in its initial stage in the Sumerian period, was\r\ndeveloped and carried to perfection by the Semitic scribes, and a very\r\nconsiderable proportion of their values and ideographic meanings is of\r\nSemitic derivation. The theological system was transformed, and a new\r\nliterature and a new art came into existence. As Sumerian words had\r\nbeen borrowed by the Semites, so, too, Semitic words were borrowed by\r\nthe Sumerians, and it is possible that examples of them may occur in\r\nsome of the oldest Sumerian texts known to us.[84] The Babylonians of\r\nhistory, in short, were a mixed people; and their culture and language\r\nwere mixed like our own.\r\n\r\nThis, then, is one main fact. A second is that the Semitic element\r\nfirst comes to the front in the northern part of Babylonia. It is in\r\nAkkad, and not in Sumer, that the first Semitic Empire--that of Sargon\r\nthe Elder, B.C. 3800--had its seat, and old as that empire\r\nis, it presupposes a long preceding period of Semitic settlement and\r\nadvance in power and civilization. The cuneiform system of writing\r\nis already complete and has ceased to be Sumerian, archive-chambers\r\nof Semitic literature are founded, and Semitic authority is firmly\r\nestablished from Susa in the east to the Mediterranean in the west.\r\nArt is no longer Sumerian, and in the hands of the Semitic subjects of\r\nSargon and his son Naram-Sin has reached a perfection which in certain\r\ndirections was never afterwards surpassed. The engraved seal-cylinders\r\nof the period are the finest that we possess. Naturally the Semitic\r\nlanguage has superseded the Sumerian in official documents, and the\r\nphysical type as represented on the monuments is also distinctly\r\nSemitic. At the beginning of the fourth millennium before our era, the\r\ncivilization and culture of Northern Babylonia have thus ceased to be\r\nSumerian, and the sceptre has fallen into the hands of a Semitic race.\r\n\r\nBut there is a third fact. The displacement of the Sumerian by the\r\nSemite was the case only in Northern Babylonia. In the south, in the\r\nland of Sumer, the older population continued to be dominant. Sumerian\r\ndynasties continued to rule there from time to time, and the old\r\nagglutinative language continued to be spoken. When a West-Semitic\r\ndynasty governed the country about B.C. 2200, state proclamations\r\nand similar official documents had still to be drawn up in the two\r\nlanguages, Semitic Babylonian and Sumerian. Sumerian did not become\r\nextinct till a later day. Indeed, after the fall of the empire of\r\nSargon of Akkad there seems to have been a Sumerian reaction. While\r\nSusa was lost to the Semites and became the capital of a non-Semitic\r\npeople who spoke an agglutinative language, the power of the Sumerian\r\nprinces in Southern Babylonia appears to have revived. At all events\r\neven the dynasty which followed that of the West-Semites bore\r\nSumerian names.[85] It was only under the foreign domination of the\r\nKassites, apparently, who governed Babylonia for nearly 600 years,\r\nthat the Sumerian element finally became merged in the Semitic and the\r\nBabylonian of later history was born.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE SEAL OF SHARGANI-SHAR-ALI (SARGON OF AKKAD):\r\n  GILGAMES WATERS THE CELESTIAL OX.]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: BAS-RELIEF OF NARAM-SIN.]\r\n\r\nThe last fact is that while what we call Assyrian is Semitic Babylonian\r\nwith a few dialectal variations, it stands apart from the other Semitic\r\nlanguages. A scientific comparison of its grammar with those of the\r\nsister-tongues leads us to believe that it represents one of the two\r\nprimeval dialects of the Semitic family of speech, the other dialect\r\nbeing that which subsequently split up into the varying dialects of\r\nCanaanite or Hebrew, Arabic, South-Arabic and Aramæan--or, adopting\r\nthe genealogical form of linguistic relationship, Assyro-Babylonian\r\nwould have been one daughter of the primitive parent-speech, while the\r\nother daughter comprised the remaining Semitic languages.[86] There\r\nare two conclusions to be drawn from this; one is that the Babylonian\r\nSemites must have separated from their kinsfolk and come under Sumerian\r\ninfluence at a very early period, the other that they moved northward,\r\nalong the banks of the Tigris into Assyria.\r\n\r\nWith these two inferences we have to be content. Upon the first home\r\nof the Semitic race or its affinities with other branches of the white\r\nrace, Babylonia can naturally throw no light. The earliest glimpses\r\nwe catch of the Semites of Babylonia are those of a people who have\r\nalready come under the influences of Sumerian civilization, who are\r\nmingling with their teachers and helping with them to build up the\r\nstately edifice of historical Babylonia. There were ruder Semitic\r\ntribes, it is true, who continued to live their own nomad life on the\r\nwestern bank of the Euphrates or in the marshes that bordered the\r\nPersian Gulf. But like the Bedâwîn of to-day on the outskirts of Egypt\r\nthey were little, if at all, affected by the civilization at their\r\nsides. They remained the same wild savages of the desert as their\r\ndescendants who encamp in the swamps of modern Babylonia; they neither\r\ntraded nor tilled the ground, and the language they spoke was not the\r\nsame as that of their Babylonian kindred. They served, however, as the\r\nherdsmen and shepherds of their Babylonian neighbours, and the vast\r\nflocks whose wool was so important an article of Babylonian trade, were\r\nentrusted to their care. But Bedâwîn they were born, and Bedâwîn they\r\ncontinued to be.\r\n\r\nEven the Aramæan tribes of the coast-land kept apart from the\r\nBabylonians, whether Sumerian or Semitic, until the day when one of\r\ntheir tribes, the Kaldâ or Chaldæans, made themselves masters of\r\nBabylon under their prince Merodach-baladan, and from henceforward\r\nbecame an integral factor in the Babylonian population. They must\r\nhave settled on the borders of Babylonia at a comparatively late\r\ndate, when Semitic Babylonian had definitely marked itself off from\r\nits sister-tongues and the Babylonian Semite had acquired distinctive\r\ncharacteristics of his own. The West-Semitic elements in the\r\npopulation of Babylonia could have entered the country only long after\r\nthe mixture of Sumerian and Semite had produced the Babylonian of\r\nhistory.\r\n\r\nThe Babylonian of history came to forget that he had ever had another\r\nfatherland than the Babylonian plain, the Eden of the Old Testament,\r\nthe land whose southern border was formed by “the salt river” or\r\nPersian Gulf of early Sumerian geography, with its four branches\r\nwhich were themselves “heads.” Here the first man Adamu[87] had been\r\ncreated in Eridu, “the good city,” and here therefore the Babylonian\r\nSemite placed the home of the first ancestor of his race. But it was a\r\nborrowed belief, borrowed along with the other elements of Babylonian\r\nculture, and no argument can be drawn from it as to the actual cradle\r\nof the Semitic race. Like the story of the deluge, it was part of the\r\nSumerian heritage into which the Semite had entered.\r\n\r\nThe Semitic tradition which made the first man a tiller of the ground\r\nmay also have been borrowed from the earlier inhabitants of Babylonia.\r\nAt all events it is significant that the garden in which he was\r\nplaced was in the land of Eden, and that the picture of a garden or\r\nplantation is one of the primitive hieroglyphs of Sumer. The beginnings\r\nof Babylonian civilization were bound up with the cultivation of the\r\nBabylonian soil; the reclamation of the great alluvial plain was at\r\nonce the effect and the cause of Sumerian culture. Sumerian culture, in\r\nfact, was at the outset essentially that of an agricultural people.\r\n\r\nTrade would have come later, when Eridu had become a seaport, and\r\nships ventured on the waters of the Persian Gulf. It grew up under the\r\nshelter of the great sanctuaries. Supported at first by the labour\r\nof their serfs, the priests in time came to exchange their surplus\r\nrevenues--the wool of their sheep, the wheat and sesame of their\r\nfields, or the wine yielded by their palms--for other commodities, and\r\nthe temples themselves formed safe and capacious store-houses in which\r\nsuch goods could be kept. In the historical period Babylonia is already\r\na great trading community, and as the centuries passed trade absorbed\r\nmore and more the energies of its population, agriculture fell into the\r\nbackground, and the Babylonia conquered by Cyrus could be described\r\nwith truth as “a nation of shopkeepers.” Even the crown prince was a\r\nmerchant who dealt in wool.[88]\r\n\r\nThe increasing preponderance of trade goes along with the increasing\r\npreponderance of the Semitic element in the country, and it is\r\ntempting to suppose that there was a connection between the two. At\r\npresent, however, there is no positive evidence that such was the case.\r\nNor is there any positive evidence that the Semites who settled in\r\nBabylonia were not already agriculturists. The circumstances in which\r\na people lives are mainly responsible for its being agricultural or\r\npastoral, and the fact that the Bedâwîn neighbours of the Babylonians\r\non the western side of the Euphrates remained a pastoral race does\r\nnot exclude the possibility that there were other branches of the\r\nSemitic family who had already passed out of the pastoral into the\r\nagricultural stage before coming into contact with the Sumerians. On\r\nthe other hand, it is at least noticeable that in Semitic Babylonian\r\nthe usual word for “city” continued to be one which properly meant a\r\n“tent”--the home of the pastoral nomad--and that no Semitic traditions\r\nhave come down to us of the beginnings of agricultural life outside the\r\nlimits of the Babylonian “Plain.” The title of “Shepherd,” moreover,\r\nwas at times given to the Babylonian kings in days subsequent to the\r\nSemitic Empire of Sargon of Akkad. So far as our materials allow us to\r\njudge, city-life was the gift of the Sumerian to the primitive Semitic\r\nnomad.[89]\r\n\r\nTo the Semite, however, I believe I have shown in my Lectures on\r\nBabylonian religion,[90] we must ascribe an important theological\r\nconception. In historical Babylonia the gods were conceived of in\r\nthe form of man. Man was created in the image of God because the gods\r\nthemselves were men. But the conception cannot be traced back further\r\nthan the age when the Sumerians and Semites came into contact with one\r\nanother. In pre-Semitic Sumer there are no anthropomorphic gods. We\r\nhear, instead, of the _zi_ or “spirit,” a word properly signifying\r\n“life” which manifested itself in the power of motion. All things\r\nthat moved were possessed of life, and there was accordingly a “life”\r\nor “spirit” of the water as well as of man or beast. In place of the\r\ndivine “lord of heaven” whom the Semites adored there was “a spirit of\r\nheaven”; in place of Ea, the later Babylonian god of the deep, there\r\nwas “a spirit of the abyss.” Sumerian theology, in fact, was still on\r\nthe level of animism, and the inventors of the script represented the\r\nidea of “god” by the picture of a star. Vestiges of the old animism can\r\nstill be detected even in the later cult: by the side of the human gods\r\nan Assyrian prayer invokes the mountains, the rivers and the winds,\r\nand from time to time we come across a worship of deified towns. It\r\nwas the town itself that was divine, not the deity to whom its chief\r\ntemple was dedicated. So, again, the god or goddess continued to be\r\nsymbolized by some sacred animal or object whose figure appears upon\r\nseals and boundary-stones, and in some cases we learn that the Sumerian\r\nprototypes of the later Babylonian divinities bore such names as “the\r\ngazelle,” “the antelope” or “the bull.”\r\n\r\nWith the advent of the Semite all is changed. The gods have become men\r\nand women with intensified powers and the gift of immortality, but in\r\nall other respects they live and act like the men and women of this\r\nnether world. Like them, too, they are born and married, and the court\r\nof the early prince finds its counterpart in the divine court of the\r\nsupreme Bel, or “Lord.” The Semitic god of Babylon was “lord of gods”\r\nand men, of heaven and earth; Assur of Assyria was “king of the gods”\r\nand lord of “the heavenly hosts.”\r\n\r\nIt was natural that, corresponding with this lord of the heavenly\r\nhosts, there should be a lord of the hosts of earth, and that as the\r\ndivine king was clothed in the attributes of man, the human king should\r\ntake upon him the divine nature. Like the Pharaohs of Egypt or the\r\nemperors of Rome, the early kings of Semitic Babylonia were deified.\r\nAnd the deification took place during their lifetime,--in fact, so far\r\nas we can judge, upon their accession to the throne. In the eyes of\r\ntheir subjects they were incarnate deities, and in their inscriptions\r\nthey give themselves the title of god. One of them is even called “the\r\ngod” of Akkad, his capital.[91]\r\n\r\nHere, then, in the conception of the divine, we have a clear dividing\r\nline between the Semite and his non-Semitic predecessor. So far back as\r\nthe cuneiform monuments allow us to carry his history, the Semite is\r\nanthropomorphic. As a consequence, the gods he worships conform to the\r\nsocial conditions under which he lives. In the desert the sacred stone\r\nbecomes “the temple of the god”; in the organized monarchy of Babylonia\r\neach deity takes his appointed place in an imperial court. Under the\r\none supreme ruler there are princes and sub-princes, vice-regents and\r\ngenerals, while angel-messengers carry the commands of Bel to his\r\nsubjects on earth, like the messengers who carried the letters of the\r\nBabylonian king along the high-roads of the empire. On the other hand,\r\nthe earthly king receives his power and attributes from the god whose\r\nadopted son and representative he claims to be. Nowhere has “the divine\r\nright of kings” been more fully insisted on than in ancient Babylonia.\r\nThe laws of the monarch had to be obeyed, foreign nations had to become\r\nhis vassals, because he was a god on earth as the supreme Bel was god\r\nin heaven.\r\n\r\nBut the reflection of the divine upon the human brought with it not\r\nonly the exaltation of sovereignty, but also the rise of a priesthood.\r\nThere were priests of a sort in Sumer of whom many different classes\r\nare enumerated. But when we examine the signification of the names\r\nattached to them we find that they were not priests in the true sense\r\nof the word. They were rather magicians, sorcerers, wizards, masters\r\nof charms. They do not develop into priests until after the Semite has\r\nentered upon the scene. The god and the priest make their appearance\r\ntogether.\r\n\r\nI do not think, however, that we are justified in concluding that the\r\nelaborate hierarchy of Babylonia was of purely Semitic origin. On the\r\ncontrary, like the theological system with which it was associated,\r\nit was a composite product. Behind the gods and goddesses of Semitic\r\nBabylonia lay the primitive “spirits” and fetishes of Sumer; its\r\nmythology and cosmological theories rested on Sumerian foundations;\r\nand in the same way the priestly hierarchy was the result of a racial\r\namalgamation in which the Semitic element had adopted and adapted the\r\nideas and institutions of the older people. We do not find the theology\r\nand priesthood of Babylonia among other Semitic populations, except\r\nwhere they had been borrowed from the Babylonians (as in Assyria); in\r\nthe form in which we know them they were peculiarly and distinctively\r\nBabylonian. Like the language of Semitic Babylonia, which is permeated\r\nwith Sumerian elements, or the script, which is a Semitic adaptation of\r\nthe Sumerian system of writing, they presuppose a mixture of race.\r\n\r\nThe priesthood eventually proved irreconcilable with “the divine\r\nright” of the monarch, though both alike had the same origin. The\r\npriests prevailed over the king, and as in England the doctrine of\r\ndivine right was unable to survive the accession of a German line\r\nof princes, so in Babylonia the accession of a foreign, non-Semitic\r\ndynasty (that of the Kassites) dealt a death-blow to the belief in a\r\ndeified king. The king became merely the representative and deputy\r\nof the divine “Lord” of heaven, deriving his right to rule from his\r\nadoption by the god as a son; Bel-Merodach came to be regarded as the\r\ntrue ruler of Babylonia, lord of the earth as well as of the heavens,\r\nand a theocratic state affords but little room for a secular king.\r\nThe priests of Bel decided whom their god should recognize or not,\r\nand little by little the controlling power of the state passed into\r\ntheir hands It was in a sense a triumph for the non-Semitic element\r\nin the population. While the deification of the sovereign may be said\r\nto have been purely Semitic in its origin, the necessary corollary of\r\nan anthropomorphic conception of the deity, the supernatural powers\r\nsupposed to be inherent in the priesthood went back to Sumerian times.\r\nIt was because he had once been a master of spells that the priest of\r\nthe anthropomorphic god could influence the spiritual world. The final\r\ntriumph of the theocratic principle in Babylonia, where the Semite\r\nhad been so long dominant, showed that the old racial element was\r\nstill strong, and ready to reassert itself when the favourable moment\r\narrived. Such, indeed, is generally the history of a mixed people: the\r\nconquering or immigrant race may seem to have suppressed or absorbed\r\nthe earlier population of the country, but as generations pass the\r\nforeign element becomes weaker, and the nation in greater or less\r\ndegree reverts to the older type.\r\n\r\n\r\n                                 NOTE\r\n\r\nSo far as the primitive culture of Sumer may be recovered from such\r\nof the primitive pictographs as can be at present identified, it may\r\nbe described as follows. The inventors of them lived on the sea-coast\r\nwithin sight of mountains, but in a marshy district where reeds\r\nabounded. Trees also grew there, and the cedar was known. Stone was\r\nscarce, but was already cut into blocks and seals. Tablets were used\r\nfor writing purposes, and copper, gold and silver were worked by the\r\nsmith. Daggers with metal blades and wooden handles were worn, and\r\ncopper was hammered into plates, while necklaces or collars were made\r\nof gold. Brick was the ordinary building material, and with it cities,\r\nforts, temples and houses were constructed. The city was provided with\r\ntowers and stood on an artificial platform; the house also had a\r\ntower-like appearance. It was provided with a door which turned on a\r\nhinge, and could be opened with a sort of key; the city gate was on a\r\nlarger scale, and seems to have been double. By the side of the house\r\nwas an enclosed garden planted with trees and other plants; wheat and\r\nprobably other cereals were sown in the fields, and the shaddûf was\r\nalready employed for the purpose of irrigation. Plants were also grown\r\nin pots or vases. That floods took place is evident from the existence\r\nof a pictograph denoting “inundation,” and representing a fish left\r\nstranded above the foliage of a tree. Canals or aqueducts had already\r\nbeen dug. The sheep, goat, ox and probably ass had been domesticated,\r\nthe ox being used for draught, and woollen clothing as well as\r\nrugs were made from the wool or hair of the two first. A feathered\r\nhead-dress was worn on the head. Beds, stools and chairs were used,\r\nwith carved legs resembling those of an ox. There were fire-places and\r\nfire-altars, and apparently chimneys also. Pottery was very plentiful,\r\nand the forms of the vases, bowls and dishes were manifold; there were\r\nspecial jars for honey, butter, oil and wine, which was probably made\r\nfrom dates, and one form of vase had a spout protruding from its side.\r\nSome of the vases had pointed feet, and stood on stands with crossed\r\nlegs; others were flat-bottomed, and were set on square or rectangular\r\nframes of wood. The oil-jars--and probably others also--were sealed\r\nwith clay, precisely as in early Egypt. Vases and dishes of stone were\r\nmade in imitation of those of clay, and baskets were woven of reeds or\r\nformed of leather. Knives, drills, wedges and an instrument which looks\r\nlike a saw were all known, while bows, arrows and daggers (but not\r\nswords nor, probably, spears) were employed in war. Time was reckoned\r\nin lunar months. Sacred cakes were offered to the gods, whose images\r\nwere symbolized sometimes by a bearded human head with a feather crown,\r\nsometimes by a two-legged table of offerings on which stand two vases\r\n(of incense?). Demons were feared who had wings like a bird, and the\r\nfoundation stones--or rather bricks--of a house were consecrated by\r\ncertain objects that were deposited under them. A “year” was denoted by\r\nthe branch of a tree, as in Egypt, and a “name” by a bird placed over\r\nthe sacred table of offerings. The country was full of snakes and other\r\ncreeping things, and wild beasts lurked in the jungle. The pictographs\r\nwere read from left to right, and various expedients were devised for\r\nmaking them express ideas. Thus _mud_, “to beget,” was denoted by the\r\npicture of a bird dropping an egg. At other times the pictograph was\r\nused to express an idea, the pronunciation of which was the same as\r\nthat of the object which it represented. The bent knee, for example,\r\nwas used to express _dug_ or _tuk_, “to have,” since it represented a\r\n“knee,” which was called _dug_ in Sumerian.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER IV\r\n\r\n                THE RELATION OF BABYLONIAN TO EGYPTIAN\r\n                             CIVILIZATION\r\n\r\n\r\nIn dealing with the question of origins, science is constantly\r\nconfronted with the problem of unity or polygeneity. Has language one\r\norigin or many; are the various races of mankind traceable to one\r\nancestor or to several? Do the older civilizations presuppose the same\r\nprimeval starting-point, or were there independent centres of culture\r\nwhich grew up unknown to one another in different parts of the world?\r\nUnder the influences of theology the belief long prevailed that they\r\nwere all sprung from the same source; of late the tendency has been in\r\nan opposite direction. While the biologist has inclined to a belief in\r\nthe unity of species, the anthropologist has seen reason to maintain\r\nthe diversity of origin in culture.\r\n\r\nThe two earliest civilizations with which we are acquainted were those\r\nof Babylonia and Egypt. To a certain extent the conditions under\r\nwhich they both arose were similar. They grew up alike on the banks\r\nof great rivers and in a warm, though not tropical, climate. They\r\nrested, moreover, on organized systems of agriculture, which again had\r\nbeen made possible by irrigation engineering. In Babylonia the first\r\nsettlers had found a plain which was little more than a swamp, over\r\nwhich the swollen streams of the Euphrates and Tigris wandered at will\r\nduring the annual period of inundation, and which needed engineering\r\nworks on a large scale before it could be made habitable. The rivers\r\nhad to be confined within their channels by means of embankments, and\r\ncanals had to be cut in order to draw off the surplus supply of water\r\nand regulate its distribution to the land. While the swamp was thus\r\nbeing made possible for habitation, the population must have lived\r\non the edge of the desert plateau which bordered it, and have there\r\ndeveloped a civilization which not only produced the engineers and\r\ntheir science, but also the concentrated authority which enabled the\r\nscience to be utilized.\r\n\r\nIn Egypt it was the banks and delta of the Nile which took the place\r\nof the Babylonian plain. Recent discoveries have shown that in the\r\nprehistoric age, when the natives still lived in the desert and led a\r\npastoral life, all this was a morass, the haunt of beasts of prey and\r\nvenomous reptiles. But here again the swamp was rendered habitable by\r\nengineering works similar to those of primeval Babylonia. The swamp\r\nwas transformed into fertile fields, the annual flood of the river was\r\nregulated, and an elaborate network of canals and embankments spread\r\nover the country. The pastoral nomads of the neolithic age became\r\nagriculturists, or were employed in constructing and repairing the\r\nworks of irrigation, or in erecting monumental buildings for their\r\nrulers. There is evidence of the same centralized government, the\r\nsame directing brain and organizing force that there is in primitive\r\nBabylonia.\r\n\r\nIs it possible that two systems of engineering science, so similar\r\nin their objects, their methods and their results, should have been\r\ninvented independently in two different countries? There are scholars\r\nwho answer in the negative. But the possibility cannot be denied,\r\nsince an even more elaborate system of irrigation was invented in\r\nChina without any suggestion, as far as we know, from outside. The\r\ngeographical conditions of Babylonia and Egypt, moreover, resemble\r\none another, and the question of draining the swamps and regulating\r\nthe overflow of the rivers once raised, the answer to it seems fairly\r\nobvious. By itself, therefore, the fact that the cultures of ancient\r\nBabylonia and Egypt alike rested on a similar system of irrigation\r\nengineering would be no proof of their common origin.\r\n\r\nIn some respects the problem which the Babylonian engineers were\r\ncalled upon to solve was more difficult than that which faced the\r\nEgyptians. The Nile is fed by the rains and melting snows of Abyssinia\r\nand Central Africa, and its annual inundation takes place in the later\r\nsummer months. The Euphrates and Tigris flow from the north, from\r\nthe highlands of Armenia, and are at their fullest in the spring.\r\nTheir overflow accordingly comes just before the summer heats, when\r\nagriculture is difficult or impossible, whereas in Egypt the period\r\nof inundation ushers in the most favourable time of the year for the\r\ngrowth of the crops. What the Babylonian engineers had to do was not\r\nonly to drain off the overflow, but also to store it for use at least\r\nsix months later. With them it was a question of storage as well as of\r\nregulation.\r\n\r\nThose then, who believe that the engineering sciences of the\r\nBabylonians and Egyptians were no independent inventions are bound to\r\nsee in Babylonia their original home. It would have been here that the\r\ngreat problems were solved, the practical application of which to the\r\nneeds of Egypt would have been a comparatively simple matter. On the\r\nchronological side there would be no difficulties in such a view. Old\r\nas was the civilization of Egypt, the excavations in Babylonia have\r\nmade it clear that the civilization of Babylonia was at least equally\r\nold. At Nippur the American excavators claim to have found inscribed\r\nremains which reach back for nearly ten thousand years, and though\r\nthe data upon which this calculation is based may be disputable, it\r\nis certain that the earliest monuments met with are of immense age.\r\nAnd it must be remembered that they belong to a time when the early\r\npictorial writing had already passed into a cursive script, and the\r\nplain of Babylonia had been a land of cultivated fields for unnumbered\r\ngenerations.\r\n\r\nBut by itself, I repeat, the practical identity of engineering science\r\nin primeval Babylonia and Egypt is no proof that it had been learnt by\r\nthe one from the other. If we are to fall back on the old belief which\r\nbrought the civilized population of Egypt from the plain of Shinar,\r\nit must be for reasons which are supported by archæological facts. If\r\nsuch archæological facts exist, the parallel systems of irrigation\r\nengineering will be additional evidence; alone, they prove nothing.\r\n\r\nAt the outset we are met by a fact which personally I find it hard to\r\nexplain away. The hieroglyphic script of Egypt has little in common\r\nwith the primitive pictorial characters of Babylonia. Objects and\r\nideas like “the sun,” “man,” “number one,” will be represented by the\r\nsame pictures or symbols all the world over, and consequently the fact\r\nthat in both Babylonian and Egyptian writing the sun is denoted by a\r\ncircle and the moon by a crescent is of no significance whatsoever.\r\nBut when we turn to less obvious symbols there is comparatively little\r\nsimilarity between the two forms of script. The ideograph of “god,” for\r\nexample, is a star in Babylonia, a stone axe and its shaft in Egypt;\r\n“life” is represented by a flowering reed in the one case, by a knotted\r\ngirdle in the other. It is true that Professor Hommel and others have\r\npointed to a few coincidences like those between the Egyptian symbol\r\nfor “foreign land” and the Babylonian ideograph of “country,” or\r\nbetween the Egyptian and Babylonian signs for “city,” “place,” but\r\nsuch coincidences are rare.[92] As a rule, as soon as we leave the\r\nmore obvious conventions of pictorial writing little or no connection\r\ncan be traced between the pictorial characters of Egypt and those of\r\nBabylonia. As a whole the two graphic systems stand apart.\r\n\r\nNevertheless I am bound to add that it is only as a whole that they\r\ndo so. With all the general unlikeness there is a curious similarity\r\nin a few--a very few--instances which it is difficult to interpret as\r\nmerely the result of accident. The round circle with lines inside it\r\nwhich denotes “a city” in Egyptian might be explained from the circular\r\nvillages which still characterize Central Africa; but then how is it\r\nthat the ideograph for “place” in the pictorial script of Babylonia had\r\nprecisely the same form? That the word for “country” should be denoted\r\nin the Babylonian script by the picture of three mountain peaks may\r\nbe due to the fact that to the Babylonian “country” and “mountain”\r\nwere the same; but such an explanation fails us in the case of the\r\nEgyptian hieroglyph of “foreign land,” where the three peaks appear\r\nagain, since the hieroglyph for “mountain” in Egyptian has but two.\r\nThe picture of a seat, and a seat, too, of peculiar shape, represents\r\n“place” in Egyptian; in Babylonian the same picture represents “city,”\r\nthus inverting the ideographic signification of the picture which in\r\nEgyptian and Babylonian has respectively the meanings of “city” and\r\n“place.” Between the primitive Babylonian picture of a “ship” and\r\nthe boats depicted in the prehistoric pottery of Egypt, again, the\r\nresemblance is very exact, and Professor Hommel has pointed out to me a\r\ncurious likeness between the original form of the Babylonian ideograph\r\nfor “a personal name” and the _ka_-sign with the Horus-hawk above\r\nit within which the names of the earliest Pharaohs are inscribed.[93]\r\nIndeed the learned and ingenious Munich Professor has made out a list\r\nof even more striking coincidences, where the characters agree not only\r\nin sense but also in the phonetic values attached to them.[94]\r\n\r\nHere, however, we trench on another question, the philological position\r\nof the Egyptian language. Egyptian scholars to-day are practically\r\nunanimous in believing it to belong, more or less remotely, to the\r\nSemitic family of speech. The Berlin school of Egyptologists, who under\r\nthe guidance of Professor Erman have made Egyptian grammar a special\r\nsubject of investigation, are largely responsible for the dominance\r\nof this belief. I ought to be the last person in the world to protest\r\nagainst it, seeing that I maintained it years ago when the patronage\r\nof the Berlin Egyptologists had not yet made it fashionable. At the\r\nsame time I confess that I cannot follow the Berlin philologists to\r\nthe extent to which they would have us go. For them the old Egyptian\r\nlanguage is not related to the Semitic family of speech “more or less\r\nremotely,” but very closely indeed. Indeed in their hands it becomes\r\nitself a Semitic language, and as a logical consequence the Egyptian\r\nscript is metamorphosed into one of purely Semitic invention. But\r\nwhile admitting that Egyptian grammar is Semitic in the sense in which\r\nEnglish grammar is Teutonic, the comparative philologist is bound\r\nto add that it contains much which cannot be reduced to a Semitic\r\npattern. The structure, moreover, is not on the whole Semitic, neither\r\nis a large part of its vocabulary. And among the words in the lexicon\r\nwhich have Semitic affinities there are a good many which are better\r\nexplained as the result of borrowing than as belonging to the original\r\nstratum of the language. In some cases they are demonstrably words\r\nwhich have been introduced into the Egyptian language at a late date;\r\nin other cases it seems possible to regard them as loan-words from\r\nSemitic Babylonian which entered the language at a “pre-dynastic”\r\nepoch. Thus, _qemḳu_, “the wheaten loaf” which was used for\r\nofferings, is the Hebrew _qemakh_, the Babylonian _qêmu_,\r\nand may have been brought into Egypt along with the wheat which was\r\nfirst cultivated in Babylonia and still grows wild on the banks of the\r\nEuphrates. To what an early period the importation of the cereal must\r\nbe referred is shown by its occurrence in the prehistoric graves of\r\nUpper Egypt.[95]\r\n\r\nWhen all allowances are made, however, the fact remains that the\r\nEgyptian language as we know it was related to the Semitic family of\r\nspeech. It stood to the latter as an elder sister, or rather as the\r\nsister of the parent-language which the existing Semitic dialects\r\npresuppose. It was not like the so-called Hamitic dialects of Eastern\r\nAfrica, which are African languages Semitized, but it was itself\r\nof the same stock as Hebrew or Semitic Babylonian. It represents,\r\nhowever, a form of language at an earlier stage of development than\r\nare any of those which we call Semitic, and it has, moreover, been\r\nlargely influenced and modified by foreign languages, which we may\r\nterm African. So extensive has this influence been that the Semitic\r\nelement has been even more disguised in it than the Teutonic element is\r\ndisguised in modern English. In leaving the soil of Asia the language\r\nof Egypt took upon it an African dress.\r\n\r\nNow though language can prove but little as regards race, it can\r\nprove a great deal as regards history. A mixed language means a mixed\r\nhistory, and indicates an intimate contact between the populations who\r\nspoke the languages which are represented in it. Egyptian grammar would\r\nnot have been Semitic if those who imposed it upon the natives of the\r\nNile had not been of Semitic descent, or at all events had not come\r\nfrom a region where the language was Semitic. Nor would this grammar\r\nhave been modified by foreign admixture if a part of those who learned\r\nto use it had not previously been accustomed to some other form of\r\nspeech. And since we know of no Semitic languages in Africa which were\r\nnot brought from Asia, we are justified in concluding that the Semitic\r\nelement in the Egyptian language was of Asiatic origin.\r\n\r\nBut we can go yet a step further. Where two languages are brought\r\ninto close contact, the general rule is that that of the stronger\r\nrace prevails. The conqueror is less likely to learn the language\r\nof the conquered than the conquered are to learn the language of\r\ntheir masters. On the other hand, the negro slave in America became\r\nEnglish-speaking, whereas the English emigrant wherever he goes\r\npreserves the language of his fathers. It is only where a conquering\r\ncaste brings no women with it that it is likely to lose its language.\r\n\r\nWhen, therefore, we find that Old Egyptian is an Africanized Semitic\r\nlanguage, we have every right to infer that it is because invaders\r\nbrought it with them from Asia who were Semites either by race or by\r\nlanguage. In other words, Egypt must have been occupied in prehistoric\r\ndays by a people who came from the Semitic area in Asia.\r\n\r\nThe days were prehistoric, but of the invasion itself history preserved\r\na tradition. On the walls of the temple of Edfu it is recounted how\r\nthe followers of Horus, the totem guide and patron deity of the first\r\nkings of Upper Egypt, made their way across the eastern desert to the\r\nbanks of the Nile, and there, with the help of their weapons of metal,\r\nsubjugated the older inhabitants of the valley. Battle after battle\r\nwas fought as the invaders slowly pushed their way down the Nile to\r\nthe Delta, establishing a forge and a sanctuary of Horus on every\r\nspot where a victory had been gained.[96] The story has come down\r\nto us under a disguise of euhemeristic mythology, but the tradition\r\nit embodies has been strikingly confirmed by modern discovery. The\r\n“dynastic” Egyptians, the Egyptians, that is to say, who founded the\r\nEgyptian monarchy and to whom we owe the great monuments of Egypt, were\r\nimmigrants from the east.\r\n\r\nThe culture of these “dynastic” Egyptians was built up on two solid\r\nfoundations, the engineering skill which made Egypt a land of\r\nagriculture, and a system of writing which made the organization of\r\nthe government possible. The culture was at once agricultural and\r\nliterary, and this alone marked it off from the culture of neolithic\r\n(or “prehistoric”) Egypt, which belonged to the desert rather than to\r\nthe banks and delta of the river, and which knew nothing of writing.\r\nNow we have seen that there was one other country in the world in which\r\na similar form of culture had come into existence. In Babylonia too\r\nwe have a civilization which has as its basis the training of rivers\r\nfor the purpose of irrigation and the use of a pictorial script. The\r\ncivilization of Babylonia was, it is true, Sumerian at its outset, but\r\nin time it became Semitic, and expressed itself in a Semitic tongue.\r\nIt is difficult to avoid the conclusion that the Semitic-speaking\r\npeople who brought the science of irrigation and the art of writing to\r\nthe banks of the Nile came, like the wheat they cultivated, from the\r\nBabylonian plain.\r\n\r\nThere are two archæological facts connected with the early culture of\r\n“dynastic” Egypt which seem to me to prove at any rate some kind of\r\nintercourse with Babylonia. No building-stone exists in the Babylonian\r\nplain; it was therefore the natural home of the art of building in\r\nbrick, and since every pebble was of value it was also the natural\r\nbirthplace of the gem-cutter. Nowhere else could the use of clay as a\r\nwriting material have suggested itself, or that of the inscribed stone\r\ncylinder which left its impression behind it when rolled over the clay.\r\nWherever we have the clay tablet and the seal-cylinder we have evidence\r\nof Babylonian influence.\r\n\r\nNow recent discoveries have shown that the culture of the early\r\ndynastic period of Egypt is distinguished from that of later times by\r\nthe employment of clay and the stone seal-cylinder. Neither the one nor\r\nthe other could have originated in the country itself, for Upper Egypt\r\n(where all authenticated discoveries of early seal-cylinders have been\r\nmade) is a land of stone, and the river-silt, which is mixed with sand,\r\nis altogether unsuited for the purpose of writing. When the Egyptians\r\nof the Eighteenth dynasty corresponded in Babylonian cuneiform with\r\ntheir subjects and allies in Asia, the clay upon which they wrote was\r\nbrought from a distance. Moreover, the stone seal-cylinder of the\r\nearly dynasties is an exact reproduction of the early seal-cylinder\r\nof Babylonia. Substitute cuneiform characters for the hieroglyphs and\r\nthere is practically no difference between them in many cases. It is\r\ndifficult to believe that such an identity of form is the result of\r\naccident, more especially when we find that, as Egyptian civilization\r\nadvanced, the seal-cylinder became less and less like its Babylonian\r\noriginal, and finally disappeared from use altogether. That is to\r\nsay, as the culture of the people was further removed from its first\r\nstarting-point, and therefore more national, an object which never\r\nhad any natural basis in the physical conditions of the country grew\r\nmore and more of an anomaly, and was eventually superseded, first by\r\nthe “button-seal” and then by the scarab. I see no other explanation\r\nof this than that it was originally introduced from Babylonia, and\r\nmaintained itself so long in an alien atmosphere only because it was\r\nbound up with a culture which had come from the same region of the\r\nworld. The seal-cylinder of the early Egyptian dynasties seems to me,\r\napart from everything else, to prove the existence of some kind of\r\n“prehistoric” intercourse between the civilizations of the Euphrates\r\nand the Nile. And in this intercourse the influences came from\r\nBabylonia to Egypt, not from Egypt to Babylonia.\r\n\r\nThe use of brick in early Egypt points in the same direction. While\r\nBabylonia was a land of clay, Upper Egypt was a land of stone, and\r\nit was as unnatural to invent the art of brick-making in the latter\r\ncountry as it was natural to do so in the former. To this day the\r\nNubians build their cottages of stone; so too do the Bedâwîn squatters\r\non the east bank of the Nile; it is only where the population is\r\nEgyptian and the influence of the old Egyptian civilization is still\r\ndominant that brick is employed. Under the Old Empire the Egyptian\r\nPharaohs built even the temples of the gods of brick; it was but\r\ngradually that the brick was superseded by stone. It was the same also\r\nin Assyria; here too, in a land of stone, brick was at first the sole\r\nbuilding material, and even the great brick platforms which the marshy\r\nsoil of Babylonia had necessitated continued to be laid. But Assyrian\r\nculture was confessedly Babylonian in origin, and the brick edifice\r\nwas therefore a characteristic of it. It was only by degrees that\r\nAssyrian architecture emancipated itself from its early traditions,\r\nand at first timidly, then more boldly, superseded the brick by stone.\r\nThe example of Assyria throws light on that of Egypt, and as the\r\nAssyrian employment of brick was due to the Babylonian origin of its\r\ncivilization, it is permissible to infer that the Egyptian employment\r\nof brick was also due to the same cause. Once more we may repeat that\r\nthere was early intercourse between Egypt and Babylonia--the land of\r\nthe brick-maker--and that in this intercourse the prevailing influences\r\ncame from the east.\r\n\r\nSuch, then, is the conclusion to which the most recent research leads\r\nus. The “dynastic” Egyptians, the Egyptians of history, spoke a\r\nlanguage which is related to those of the Semitic family; their first\r\nkingdoms, so far as we know, were in Upper Egypt, and tradition brought\r\nthem across the eastern desert to the banks of the Nile. The culture\r\nwhich they possessed was characterized by Babylonian features, and was\r\ntherefore due either wholly or in part to intercourse with Babylonia.\r\nThe fact that the use of the seal-cylinder--which, by the way, bore the\r\nSemitic name of _khetem_--should have lingered in the valley of\r\nthe Nile to the very beginnings of the Middle Empire, is an indication\r\nthat the period of its introduction could not have been very remote.\r\nThe earliest historical monuments which have been revealed to us by\r\nmodern excavation may not, after all, be many centuries later than the\r\ntime when the culture of Babylonia found its way to the Nile.\r\n\r\nIndeed, there is a fact which indicates that this is the case, and that\r\nthe literary culture of Babylonia had been imported into the valley of\r\nthe Nile at a time when Egypt was divided into independent kingdoms.\r\nAt an early epoch an ingenious system of official chronology had been\r\ninvented in Babylonia. The years were named there after the chief\r\nevents that had occurred in each of them, among these the accession\r\nor death of a king being naturally prominent. At the death of a king\r\na list was drawn up of his regnal years, with their characteristic\r\nevents, and such lists were from time to time combined into longer\r\nchronicles. The Babylonians were preeminently a commercial people, and\r\nfor purposes of trade it was necessary that contracts and other legal\r\ndocuments should be dated accurately, and that in case of a dispute the\r\ndate should be easily ascertained. Now an exactly similar system of\r\ndating had been adopted in Egypt before the age of the First historical\r\ndynasty. A pre-Menic monument dated in this way has been discovered at\r\nHierakonpolis in Upper Egypt, and the same method of reckoning time\r\nis found on ivory tablets that have been disinterred at Abydos. The\r\nmethod lasted down to the age of the Fifth dynasty, since the Museum\r\nof Palermo contains the fragment of a stone from Heliopolis, on which\r\nthe chronology of the Egyptian kings is given from Menes onward, each\r\nyear being named after the event or events from which it had received\r\nits official title. The successive reigns are divided from one another\r\nas in the Babylonian lists, and the height of the Nile in each year\r\nis further added--a note which naturally is of Egyptian origin. It\r\nis, therefore, interesting to observe that it is added as a note,\r\nindependent of the event which gave its name to the year. Nothing\r\ncould prove more clearly the foreign origin of the whole system of\r\nchronology, since, had it been of native invention, the height of the\r\nNile, on which the prosperity of the country depended, would have been\r\nthe first event to be recorded. After the fall of the Old Empire this\r\nancient Babylonian method of dating seems to have passed out of use\r\nlike the Babylonian seal-cylinder; at all events we find no further\r\ntraces of it. It was, in short, an exotic which never took kindly to\r\nEgyptian soil.\r\n\r\nDid the “dynastic” Egyptians bring this method of dating with them,\r\nor did they borrow it after their settlement in Egypt? The second\r\nsupposition is very difficult to entertain, for intimate trade\r\nrelations between Babylonia and Upper (or Lower)[97] Egypt in the\r\npre-Menic age appear to be out of the question, and are unsupported by\r\nany known facts. And literary correspondence, such as was carried on in\r\nthe time of the Eighteenth dynasty, seems equally out of the question.\r\nHow, then, did the Egyptians come to learn the peculiar Babylonian\r\nsystem of chronology unless the founders of the culture of which it\r\nformed a portion had originally brought it with them from the east?\r\n\r\nThe same question is raised by the existence in early Egypt of an\r\nartistic _motif_ which had its origin in Babylonia. This is what\r\nis usually known as the heraldic position of the figures of men and\r\nanimals. An example of it is found on the famous “palette” of Nar-Buzau\r\ndiscovered by Mr. Quibell at Hierakonpolis,[98] where the hybrid\r\nmonsters whose necks form the centre of the slate are heraldically\r\narranged. In this case the design is known to be Babylonian, since\r\nM. Heuzey has pointed out a Babylonian seal-cylinder on which the\r\ntwo monsters recur. Nar-Buzau is made the immediate predecessor of\r\nMenes by Professor Petrie on grounds to which every archæologist must\r\nassent; but an even better example of the heraldic design is met with\r\non a great isolated rock of sandstone near El-Kab which was quarried\r\nin the time of the Old Empire. Here the ownership and opening of the\r\nquarry are denoted by an elaborate sculpture of the Pharaoh, who is\r\nduplicated, his two forms being figured as seated back to back, with\r\na column between them, while the winged solar disk of Edfu, with the\r\nroyal uræi on either side of the orb, spreads its wings above them.\r\nEach of the royal forms holds a sceptre, but that on the left has\r\nno head-dress, whereas that on the right wears a skull-cap, above\r\nwhich is the solar orb with the uræus serpent issuing from it.[99]\r\nIn front of the latter is an altar consisting of a bowl on a stand,\r\nloaves of bread and a cup and jar of wine (with the customary handles\r\nfor suspension) being engraved above the bowl along with a series\r\nof perpendicular lines which in this instance cannot (as has been\r\nsuggested) represent the fringes of a mat. In front of the figure on\r\nthe left is another altar, of different shape, the place of the bowl\r\nbeing taken by a flat top, above which are six upright lines and a\r\nflat cake. Precisely the same altar with the same objects above it are\r\nengraved on a broken seal-cylinder of ivory found by Dr. Reisner at\r\nNaga’ ed-Dêr, which I understand from the discoverer to be of the age\r\nof the First dynasty. When, therefore, was it that the heraldic design\r\nin art was introduced into Egypt from its Babylonian birthplace? In any\r\ncase it would seem to have been before the foundation of the united\r\nmonarchy.\r\n\r\nIn Babylonia itself, as we have seen, tradition looked seaward, towards\r\nthe Persian Gulf, for the elements of its civilization. At any rate\r\nthe seaport of Eridu was the gateway through which the culture of\r\nBabylonia was believed to have passed. Here on the shores of the sea\r\nthe culture-god of Sumer had his home; here trade sprang up, and the\r\nsailors and merchants of Eridu came into contact with men of other\r\nlands and other habits. Is it possible to discover a connection between\r\nEridu and primeval Egypt?\r\n\r\nI believe that it is, though in making the attempt we are of\r\ncourse treading upon precarious ground. There are certain curious\r\ncoincidences, one of which, since it goes to the heart of Sumerian and\r\nEgyptian religion, is necessarily of considerable weight. But they are\r\nall, it must be remembered, more in the nature of indications and\r\npossibilities than of ascertained facts.\r\n\r\nEridu meant in Sumerian “the good city.” Memphis (Men-nofer), “the good\r\nplace,” the name of the first capital of united Egypt, had the same\r\nsignification. In the case of Eridu the name had something to do with\r\nthe fact that the city was the seat of Ea, the god of beneficent spells\r\nand incantations, who had given the arts and sciences to man, and was\r\never ready to heal those that were sick. The son and vice-gerent of\r\nEa, who carried his commands to earth and spent his time in curing\r\ndiseases and raising “the dead to life,” was Asari, “the prince,” who\r\nwas usually entitled Mulu-dugga, “the good” or “beneficent one.” The\r\ncharacter and attributes of Asari are thus the same as those of the\r\nEgyptian Osiris, who was also known as Ati, “the prince,” and was\r\ncommonly addressed as Un-nofer, “the good being.” Unlike most of the\r\nEgyptian deities, Osiris had the same human form as Asari of Eridu,\r\nand the resemblance between the names of Asari and Osiris--Asar in\r\nEgyptian--is rendered more striking by the remarkable fact that they\r\nare both represented by two ideographs or hieroglyphs of precisely\r\nthe same shape and signification.[100] It does not appear possible to\r\nascribe such a threefold identity to mere coincidence. And the theory\r\nof coincidence becomes still more improbable when we remember that\r\nwhile the story of Osiris centres in his death and resurrection, one\r\nof the chief offices of the Sumerian Asari was to “raise the dead\r\nto life.” Nowhere else in Babylonian literature, whether Sumerian\r\nor Semitic, do we find any reference to a resurrection; the Semitic\r\nBabylonians, indeed, did not look forward to a future life at all, or\r\nif they did, it was to a shadowy existence in a subterranean land of\r\ndarkness “where all things are forgotten.” It is only in connection\r\nwith Asari that we hear of a possibility that the dead may live again.\r\n\r\nOther resemblances between the theologies of Eridu and primitive Egypt\r\nhave been pointed out. Professor Hommel believes that in the Egyptian\r\ndeity Nun, the heavenly ocean, we must see a Sumerian god Nun, who also\r\nrepresented the celestial abyss. However this may be, an old formula,\r\ntorn from its context, which has been introduced into the Pyramid texts\r\nof the Pharaoh Pepi I., takes us back not only to the cosmology of\r\nEridu but to the literary form in which it had been expressed. Pepi, it\r\nis said, “was born of his father Tum. At that time the heaven was not,\r\nthe earth was not, men did not exist, the gods were not born, there was\r\nno death.” The words are almost a repetition of those with which the\r\nBabylonian epic of the creation begins: “At that time the heaven above\r\nwas not known by name, the earth beneath was not named ... at that\r\ntime the gods had not appeared, any one of them”; and they are also a\r\ndistant echo of the commencement of the cosmological legend of Sumerian\r\nEridu: “At that time no holy house, no house of the gods in a holy\r\nplace had been built, no reed had grown, no tree had been planted.”[101]\r\n\r\nThe testimony of philological archæology, if I may use such a term, is\r\nsupplemented by that of archæological discovery. Sumerian Babylonia and\r\nearly dynastic Egypt are alike characterized by vases of hard stone,\r\nmany of which have the same forms. Examples of some of them will be\r\nfound in de Morgan’s _Recherches sur les Origines de l’Égypte_,\r\nii. p. 257, where Jéquier observes that analogues to the Egyptian vases\r\nhave been disinterred by de Sarzec at Tello in Southern Babylonia,\r\n“the shape and execution of which are exactly like” those discovered\r\nin Egypt, “the only difference being that the one are ornamented with\r\nhieroglyphics, and the others with a cuneiform inscription; apart\r\nfrom this they are identical in make.” The most remarkable instance\r\nof identity, however, is the design on the palette of the pre-Menic\r\nPharaoh Nar-Buzau to which attention was first called by Professor\r\nHeuzey.[102] On this we have a representation of two lions set face\r\nto face in the Babylonian fashion, and with long serpentine necks\r\nwhich are interlaced so as to enclose a circle. Precisely the same\r\nrepresentation is met with on an early Babylonian seal-cylinder from\r\nTello.\r\n\r\nYears ago I noticed the general likeness presented by the seated\r\nstatues of Tello to those of the Third Egyptian dynasty,[103] and\r\nsuggested that both belonged to the same school of sculpture. A little\r\nearlier Professor Flinders Petrie had demonstrated that the standard\r\nof measurement marked upon the plan of the city which one of the Tello\r\nfigures holds in his lap is the same as the standard of measurement of\r\nthe Egyptian pyramid-builders, the cubit, namely, of 20·63, which is\r\nquite different from the later Assyro-Babylonian cubit of 21·6.[104]\r\nStill more convincing, perhaps, is the Babylonian division of the year\r\ninto twelve months of thirty days each, which was already known in\r\nEgypt in the age of the early dynasties. The Babylonian week of five\r\nand ten days reappears in the Egyptian week of ten days, while the\r\ndivision of the day into twelve “double hours,” six belonging to the\r\nday and six to the night, has its counterpart in the Egyptian day of\r\ntwenty-four hours, twelve of which were reckoned to the day and the\r\nother twelve to the night. Since a list of the thirty-six decans or\r\nzodiacal stars has recently been found on a coffin of the time of the\r\nTwelfth Dynasty[105] it is possible that this distinctively Babylonian\r\ninvention may also go back to the age of the first Egyptian dynasties.\r\nAt all events one of the chief stars in the Pyramid texts is “the Bull\r\nof heaven,” a translation of the Sumerian Gudi-bir, or “Bull of Light,”\r\nthe name given to the planet Jupiter in its relation to the ecliptic.\r\nIn primitive Babylonian astronomy the zodiacal sign of the Bull ushered\r\nin the year.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: SITTING STATUE OF GUDEA.]\r\n\r\nIt may be that some of these evidences of Babylonian influence are\r\nreferable to contact between Babylonia and Egypt in the age that\r\nimmediately preceded the foundation of the united Egyptian monarchy\r\nrather than to that still earlier age when the “dynastic” settlers\r\nfirst settled in the valley of the Nile. But at present we do not\r\nknow how such a contact could have taken place. Upper Egypt and not\r\nthe Delta was the seat of the first Pharaohs with their Horus-hawk\r\ntotem, and at the remote period when the future civilization of the\r\ncountry was being developed under their fostering care it is difficult\r\nto believe that Babylonian soldiers or traders had made their way\r\nto the shores of the Mediterranean, much less to the deserts of the\r\nSayyîd. For the present, at all events, where we have clear proof of\r\nthe dependence of early Egyptian culture upon that of the Babylonians\r\nwe have no alternative but to ascribe it to the Semitic emigrants or\r\ninvaders to whom the historical civilization of Egypt was primarily\r\ndue.[106]\r\n\r\nThis civilization, like that of Babylonia, implied a knowledge of\r\nmetal. It was a civilization of the copper age, and thus stood in sharp\r\ncontrast to the neolithic culture, such as it was, of “prehistoric”\r\nEgypt. Egyptian tradition, it is true, believed that the metal weapons\r\nwith which the followers of Horus had overcome the stone-defended\r\nnatives of the country were of iron, but this was because the compilers\r\nof the story in its existing form projected the knowledge and usages\r\nof their own time back into the past. There is incontrovertible proof\r\nthat in Egypt, as in Europe, the ages of copper and bronze preceded\r\nthat of iron. But the tradition was doubtless right in laying stress\r\nupon the fact that the invaders were forgers and blacksmiths. It\r\nwould have been by reason of the superiority of their arms that\r\nthey succeeded in subduing the valley of the Nile and reducing its\r\ninhabitants to serfdom. They were, too, “the followers of Horus,”\r\nunder the leadership of a single prince who was himself a Horus, that\r\nis to say, an incarnate god. Here, again, we find ourselves in the\r\npresence of a conception and doctrine of Semitic Babylonia. There, too,\r\nas we have seen, the kings were incarnate gods, not only the sons of\r\na divinity, but themselves divine. In Egypt, apart from the Osirian\r\ncircle, the gods were not men, but animals, and so deeply rooted was\r\nthis beast-worship in the hearts of the indigenous population that\r\neven the “dynastic” civilization, with all its unifying and absorbing\r\npower, never succeeded in doing more than in uniting the head of the\r\nbeast with the body of the man. Even the human Pharaoh was forced to\r\npicture himself as a hawk. In Semitic Babylonia on the other hand, as\r\nwe have seen, the deification of the king flowed naturally from the\r\nanthropomorphic conception of the deity; where man was made in the\r\nimage of God, it was easy to see in him a god on earth. Like the use\r\nof copper, therefore, the deification of the king which characterized\r\ndynastic Egypt points back to Babylonia.\r\n\r\nIt must not be supposed, however, that because certain elements and\r\nleading characteristics in the civilization of historical Egypt\r\nindicate that the Semitic-speaking race to whom it was mainly due\r\ncame originally from Babylonia, there are no elements in it which can\r\nbe derived from elsewhere. On the contrary, there is much that is\r\nnative to Egypt itself. Even the script shows but comparatively few\r\ntraces of a Babylonian origin. If the “dynastic” Egyptians came from\r\nBabylonia, they must have very considerably modified and developed\r\nthe seeds of culture which they brought with them. And in Egypt they\r\nfound a neolithic culture which had already made considerable progress.\r\nThe indigenous population possessed the same artistic sense as the\r\npalæolithic European of the Solutrian and Magdalenian epochs, with whom\r\nperhaps it was contemporaneous, and under the direction of its dynastic\r\nconquerors this sense was trained and educated until the Egyptians of\r\nhistory became one of the most artistic peoples of the old world.\r\n\r\nBut it is noticeable that throughout the historical period whenever the\r\ncivilizations of Egypt and Babylonia came into contact, it was Egypt\r\nthat was influenced rather than Asia. The tradition of the earliest\r\nages was thus carried on; the stream of influence flowed from the east,\r\nand Herodotus was justified in assigning Egypt to Asia rather than\r\nto Africa. It was, in fact, Asia with an African colouring. In the\r\ndays of the Eighteenth dynasty, when Egypt for the first and last time\r\npossessed an Asiatic empire, the eastern influence is very marked. The\r\nscript itself became Babylonian, the correspondence of the Government\r\nwith its own officials in Canaan was conducted in the Babylonian\r\nlanguage and the Babylonian syllabary, and there are indications that\r\neven the official memoranda of the campaigns of Thothmes III. were\r\ndrawn up in cuneiform characters. The clay tablets of Babylonia were\r\nimitated in Upper Egypt, where hieroglyphic and hieratic characters\r\nwere somewhat awkwardly impressed upon them, and the language was\r\nfilled with Semitic loan-words. The fashionable author of the age of\r\nthe Nineteenth dynasty interlarded his style not only with Semitic\r\nwords, but even with Semitic phrases. It is true that the Semitic words\r\nand phrases are Canaanite; but Canaan had long been a province of\r\nBabylonia, and it was because it was permeated with Babylonian culture\r\nand used the Babylonian script, that the foreign words and phrases were\r\nintroduced into the literary language of Egypt.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, so far as, we can judge, there was no reflex action\r\nof Egypt upon Babylonia. The seal-cylinder was never superseded there\r\nby the scarab; indeed the only scarabs yet found in the Mesopotamian\r\nregion are memorials of the Egyptian conquests of the Eighteenth\r\ndynasty. Neither the hieroglyphs nor the hieratic of Egypt made their\r\nway eastward into Asia, a fact which is somewhat remarkable when we\r\nremember over how wide an area the more complicated cuneiform spread.\r\nIt was Europe that was affected by Egypt rather than Asia. Before\r\nEgypt laid claim to Palestine, Babylonian culture had already taken\r\ntoo firm a hold of Western Asia to be dislodged, and in Babylonia\r\nitself Egyptian influences are hard to find. In the age of Khammu-rabi,\r\nwe meet with a few proper names which may contain the name of the\r\nSun-god Ra, as well as with the name of Anupum or Anubis on a stone\r\ncylinder, and the hieroglyphic character _nefer_, “good,” is\r\naffixed to a legal document.[107] But this merely proves that in a\r\nperiod when the Babylonian Empire reached to the confines of Egypt,\r\nthere were Egyptians settled in Babylon for the purpose of trade. A\r\nmore curious example of possible Egyptian influence is one to which\r\nI have drawn attention in my lectures on the _Religions of Ancient\r\nEgypt and Babylonia_.[108] Thoth, the Egyptian god of literature,\r\nwas accompanied by four apes, who sang hymns to the rising and setting\r\nsun. Travellers have described the dancing and screaming of troops of\r\napes at daybreak when the sun first lights up the earth, and the origin\r\nof these companions of Thoth has been cleared up by an inscription in\r\na tomb at Assuan. Here we learn that in the age of the Old Empire,\r\nexpeditions were sent by the Pharaohs into the Sudan--the home of the\r\napes of Thoth--in order to bring back from “the land of the gods”\r\nDanga dwarfs who could “dance the dances of the gods.” In the eyes of\r\nthe Egyptians, it would seem, there was little difference between the\r\nape and the Danga dwarf; the one was a dwarf-like ape, the other an\r\nape-like man. But they alone could perform correctly the dances that\r\nwere held in honour of certain gods, and which are already depicted\r\non the prehistoric vases of Egypt.[109] Closely allied to the Danga\r\ndwarfs and the apes of Thoth are the Khnumu or Patæki of Memphis, the\r\nfollowers of Ptah, who were also dwarfs with bowed legs. Now dwarfs of\r\nprecisely the same form are found on early Babylonian seal-cylinders\r\nwhere they are associated sometimes with the goddess Istar, sometimes\r\nwith an ape and the god Sin.[110] The Babylonian name of the dwarf was\r\nthe Sumerian Nu-gidda, an indication that his association with the\r\ndeity went back to Sumerian times. We may conclude that, like the Danga\r\ndwarf of Egypt, he, too, performed dances in honour of the gods.\r\n\r\nThe extraordinary resemblance of form between the Egyptian and\r\nBabylonian sacred dwarfs, as represented in art, raises the question\r\nwhether the Babylonian dwarf was not an importation from Egypt, since\r\nthe ape with which he was confounded was a native of the Sudan. This\r\nwas the view to which I was long inclined, but there are certain\r\nconsiderations which make it difficult to be accepted. The Khnumu of\r\nMemphis were not the only dwarfs who were represented by the Egyptian\r\nartists. Still better known was Bes, who became a special favourite\r\nin the Roman period, when he was made a sort of patron of childbirth.\r\nBut Bes, it was remembered, had come to Egypt from the southern lands\r\nof Somali and Arabia, like the goddess Hathor or the god Horus. Hathor\r\nis, I believe, the Babylonian Istar, who has passed to Egypt through\r\nher South Arabian name of Athtar; however this may be, Ptah of Memphis,\r\nwhose followers were the Khnumu dwarfs, bears a Semitic name, and must\r\ntherefore be of Semitic derivation. He belongs, that is to say, to the\r\nEgyptians of the dynastic stock, and is accordingly one of the few\r\nEgyptian divinities who is depicted in human form. On the other hand,\r\nthe Sumerian dwarf Nu-gidda is the companion of Istar.\r\n\r\nOn the Egyptian side, therefore, the dwarfs of Ptah are associated\r\nwith a god who has come from Asia, while the dwarf Bes was confessedly\r\nof foreign extraction. On the Babylonian side the dwarf Nu-gidda was\r\nthe associate of Istar, the counterpart of Hathor, and of Sin, the\r\nMoon-god, who was adopted by the people of Southern Arabia, and whose\r\nname was carried as far as Mount Sinai on the borders of Egypt. All\r\nthis suggests that the sacred dwarf came to the valley of the Nile from\r\nBabylonia and Arabia like the name of Ptah, the creator of the world.\r\nIn this case it would have come with the dynastic Egyptians before the\r\nage of history begins.\r\n\r\nBut, on the other hand, there is the ape, and the ape is figured\r\nalong with the dwarf on the Babylonian seals, It is true that the ape\r\nis equally foreign to Egypt and Babylonia, but the Sudan is nearer\r\nEgypt than Southern Arabia is to Babylonia. The actual date and path\r\nof migration, therefore, of the sacred dwarf must be left undecided.\r\nWhether he was brought to Egypt at the dawn of history, or whether he\r\ntravelled to Babylonia in the historical age remains doubtful. All we\r\ncan be sure of is that the sacred dwarfs of Babylonia and Egypt were\r\noriginally one and the same, and that they testify to an intercourse\r\nbetween the two countries of which all literary record has been\r\nlost.[111]\r\n\r\nThe same verdict must be given in the case of another point, not only\r\nof resemblance, but of identity, between ancient Egypt and Babylonia.\r\nThis is the shadûf or contrivance for drawing water from a falling\r\nriver for the sake of irrigation. The shadûf, which is still used\r\nin Upper Egypt, can be traced back pictorially to the time of the\r\nEighteenth dynasty, but the basin system of irrigation with which it\r\nwas connected was already of immemorial antiquity. It is a simple yet\r\nmost effective invention, and on that account perhaps the less likely\r\nto have been independently invented, for it is always the obvious\r\nwhich remains longest unnoticed. In the modern shadûf a long pole is\r\nlaid across a beam which is supported at either end upon other poles\r\nor on pillars of brick or mud; it is kept in place by thongs and is\r\nheavily weighted at one end, while at the other end a bucket or skin\r\nis attached to it by means of a rope. The shadûf of the Eighteenth\r\ndynasty was supported sometimes, as to-day, on a cross-beam, sometimes\r\non a column of mud, and the bucket was of triangular form with two\r\nhandles to which the rope was tied. Representations of it from Theban\r\ntombs will be found in Maspero’s _Dawn of Civilization_, p. 764,\r\nand Sir Gardner Wilkinson’s _Ancient Egyptians_, plates 38 and\r\n356. Precisely the same machine is represented on a bas-relief found by\r\nLayard in the palace of Kûyunjik at Nineveh,[112] the only difference\r\nbeing that the shadûf-worker stands upon a platform of brick instead\r\nof on the bank itself, and that the pillar upon which the pole is\r\nsupported seems to be built of bricks rather than of mud. The machine,\r\nhowever, is identical in both its Egyptian and its Assyrian form. That\r\nthe bas-relief should have been found in Assyria and not in Babylonia\r\nis a mere accident. Like almost everything else in Assyrian culture,\r\nthe invention was of Babylonian origin, and, in fact, formed part of\r\nthe system of irrigation which made the plain of Babylonia habitable.\r\nHerodotus, who calls the machine a κηλωνεῖον, describes it as being\r\nused as in Egypt, and for the same reason, since the river did not\r\nrise to the actual level of the cultivated ground, which, like that of\r\nEgypt, was divided into a number of basins.[113]\r\n\r\nThe palace of Kûyunjik belongs to the last age of Assyrian history.\r\nBut the shadûf in Babylonia went back to the Sumerian period, as we\r\nknow from the references to it in the lexical tablets. It was called\r\n_dulâtum_ in Semitic Babylonian, the pole or poles being _kakritum_,\r\nand the bucket _zirqu_ or _zirqatum_ (Sumerian _sû_),[114] and\r\nan old Sumerian collection of agricultural precepts describes how\r\nthe irrigator “fixes up the shadûf, hangs up the bucket and draws\r\nwater.”[115] The “irrigator” was naturally an important personage in\r\nearly Babylonia, and legend averred that the famous Sargon of Akkad,\r\nthe founder of the first Semitic Empire, had been rescued as a child\r\nfrom a watery grave, and brought up by one. In both Babylonia and Egypt\r\nthe shadûf was closely associated with a system of irrigation which\r\nwent back to the dawn of their several histories.\r\n\r\nWhat explanation must we give of its identity in the two countries?\r\nThere are three possibilities. In the first place, it may have been\r\ninvented independently on the banks of both the Euphrates and the\r\nNile. Similar conditions tend to produce similar results. But against\r\nthis is the fact that the shadûf was not the only kind of irrigating\r\nmachine that was suggested by the nature of the two rivers and\r\nthe lands through which they flowed. In modern Egypt, besides the\r\nshadûf there are the _saqia_, or water-wheel, and an irrigating\r\ncontrivance which is in use in the Delta. The water-wheel, we know, was\r\na Babylonian invention which was imported into Egypt in comparatively\r\nrecent times; the irrigating contrivance of the Delta, which consists\r\nof a bucket suspended on a rope swung by two men who stand facing\r\neach other, is a primitive instrument which might have been invented\r\nanywhere. Its survival is due to the fact that in the flat marshes of\r\nthe Delta, the shadûf, though saving labour, is not necessary, and it\r\ntherefore continued to be employed there after the shadûf was known.\r\nBut this implies that the shadûf was not the oldest instrument for\r\nraising the water of the Nile.\r\n\r\nThen there is the second possibility that the shadûf was borrowed by\r\nEgypt from Babylonia or by Babylonia from Egypt in historical times.\r\nIn Babylonia, however, we can trace its history back to the Sumerian\r\nepoch, and in both countries it was intimately connected with a system\r\nof irrigation the origin of which must be sought in the prehistoric\r\nage, and which was probably carried from the valley of the Euphrates to\r\nthat of the Nile. There remains the third possibility that it came to\r\nEgypt along with the system of irrigation itself.\r\n\r\nIt is always easier to ask questions than to answer them, in archæology\r\nas in other things. There are many details connected with the early\r\nrelationship between the civilizations of Babylonia and Egypt which\r\nmust be left to future research to discover. But of that relationship\r\nthere can now be little question in the minds of those who are\r\naccustomed to deal with inductive evidence. There was intercourse in\r\nthe prehistoric age between the two countries, and the civilizing\r\ninfluences, like the wheat and the language, came from the lands which\r\nbordered on the Euphrates. Civilized man made his way from the east,\r\nand dwelt in primeval days “in the land of Shinar.”[116]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: THE 1^{ST}. ASSYRIAN EMPIRE]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               CHAPTER V\r\n\r\n                        BABYLONIA AND PALESTINE\r\n\r\n\r\nA very few years ago Palestine was still archæologically an unknown\r\nland. Its history subsequent to the Israelitish conquest could be\r\ngathered from the Old Testament, and Egyptian papyri of the age of\r\nthe Nineteenth dynasty had told us something about its condition\r\nimmediately prior to that event. Thanks to the Palestine Exploration\r\nFund, the country had been carefully surveyed, and the monuments\r\nstill existing on its surface had been noted and registered. But the\r\nearlier history of the people, their races and origin, their social\r\nand religious life, and their relation to the rest of the world, were\r\nstill a blank. Of the Canaan invaded by the children of Israel we knew\r\nnothing from an archæological point of view, and very little even of\r\nthe Palestine that was governed by Israelitish judges and Jewish kings.\r\n\r\nThe veil has at last been lifted which so long lay over the face of\r\nPalestine. Cuneiform texts have come to clear up its civil history,\r\nwhile the spade of the excavator has supplemented their evidence on\r\nthe more purely archæological side. The history of Palestine can\r\nnow be followed back not only into the neolithic, but even into\r\nthe palæolithic age, and the source and character of Canaanite\r\ncivilization have been in large measure revealed to us.\r\n\r\nFirst and foremost among the materials which have made this possible\r\nare the cuneiform tablets of Tel el-Amarna in Upper Egypt, which\r\nwere discovered in 1887. Tel el-Amarna, about midway between Minia\r\nand Assiut, is the site of a city which sprang, like a meteor, into\r\na brief but glorious existence under the so-called “heretic king”\r\nAmon-hotep IV. about B.C. 1400. Amon-hotep, under the guidance\r\nof his mother, had endeavoured to suppress the old state religion of\r\nEgypt, and to substitute for it a pantheistic monotheism. In spite\r\nof persecution, however, the adherents of the old faith proved too\r\nstrong for the king; he was forced to leave Thebes, the capital of his\r\nfathers, and to build a new capital further north, where he changed\r\nhis name to that of Khu-n-Aten, and called artists from the islands\r\nof the Mediterranean to adorn his palace. When moving from Thebes he\r\nnaturally transferred to the new seat of government both the Foreign\r\nOffice and its records in so far as they covered the reign of his\r\nfather Amon-hotep III. and his own. For reasons unknown to us they do\r\nnot extend further back.\r\n\r\nThey were all in the cuneiform script, and for the most part in the\r\nBabylonian language. The fact came upon the historian with a shock\r\nof surprise, and had far-reaching consequences, historical as well\r\nas archæological. In the first place, they proved what had already\r\nbeen suspected, that under the Eighteenth dynasty Egypt possessed an\r\nAsiatic empire which stretched to the banks of the Euphrates. Then,\r\nsecondly, they showed that Western Asia was at the time intersected by\r\nhigh-roads along which merchants and couriers were constantly passing,\r\nand an active literary correspondence was carried on. Thirdly--and\r\nthis was the greatest surprise of all--they made it clear that this\r\ncorrespondence was in the script and language of Babylonia, and that it\r\nwas shared in by writers of various nationalities and languages, of all\r\nclasses of society and of both sexes. The Hittite and Cappadocian kings\r\nwrote to the Pharaoh in cuneiform characters, just as did the kings\r\nof Babylonia and Assyria. Arab shêkhs and Hittite condottieri joined\r\nin the correspondence, and politically-minded ladies did the same.\r\nEven the Egyptian Government was compelled to suppress all feelings of\r\nnational vanity, and to conduct the whole of its correspondence with\r\nits own governors and vassals in Palestine or Syria in the foreign\r\nlanguage and syllabary. There is no trace anywhere of the use of either\r\nthe Egyptian language or the Egyptian mode of writing.\r\n\r\nFrom these facts other facts follow. The age of the Eighteenth Egyptian\r\ndynasty must have been quite as literary as the age of our own\r\neighteenth century, and international correspondence must have been\r\nquite as easy, if not easier. Education, moreover, must have been very\r\nwidely spread; all the civilized world was writing and reading; and the\r\nsystem of writing was a most complicated one, demanding years of study\r\nand memory. In spite of this it was known not only to a professional\r\nclass of scribes and the officials of the Government, but also to the\r\nshêkhs of petty Canaanitish towns and even to Bedâwîn chiefs. And along\r\nwith the system of writing went a knowledge of the foreign language\r\nof Babylonia--the French of Western Asia--including some slight\r\nacquaintance with the extinct language of the Sumerians. All this\r\npresupposes libraries and archive-chambers where books and dispatches\r\ncould be stored, as well as schools where the Babylonian script and\r\nlanguage could be taught and learned.\r\n\r\nSuch libraries and schools had existed in Babylonia from a very\r\nearly age. Every great city had its library, every great temple\r\nits muniment-room. Here the clay books were numbered and arranged\r\non shelves, catalogues being provided which gave their titles. The\r\nsystem under which the longer literary or semi-scientific works were\r\narranged and catalogued was at once ingenious and complete. By the\r\nside of the library was naturally the school. Here every effort was\r\nmade to facilitate the progress of the scholars, more especially in\r\nthe study of the Sumerian language and texts. The characters of the\r\nsyllabary were classified and named; comparative grammars, dictionaries\r\nand reading-books of Sumerian and Semitic Babylonian were compiled,\r\nlists of Semitic synonyms were drawn up, explanatory commentaries were\r\nwritten on older works, and interlinear translations provided for the\r\nSumerian texts. But with all this the cuneiform system of writing\r\nmust have been hard even for the native Babylonian to learn, and in\r\nthe case of the foreigner its difficulties were multiplied. It may be\r\ndoubted whether the average boy of to-day, who finds the spelling of\r\nhis own English almost too much for him, would have had the memory and\r\npatience to learn the cuneiform characters. Even in Sumerian times the\r\ndifficulty of the task was realized, for there is a Sumerian proverb\r\nthat “he who would excel in the school of the scribes must rise with\r\nthe dawn.”[117] It says much for the educational zeal of the Oriental\r\nworld in the century before the Exodus that it was just this difficult\r\nand complicated script which it chose as its medium for correspondence.\r\n\r\nThe fact, however, points unmistakably to its cause. The reason why the\r\nBabylonian language and syllabary were thus in use throughout Western\r\nAsia, and why even the Egyptian Government was obliged to employ them\r\nin its communications with its Asiatic subjects, can only have been\r\nbecause Babylonian culture was too deeply rooted there to be superseded\r\nby any other. Before Egypt appeared upon the scene under the conquerors\r\nof the Eighteenth dynasty, Western Asia, as far as the Mediterranean,\r\nmust have been for centuries under the direct influence and domination\r\nof Babylonia. I say domination as well as influence, for in the ancient\r\nEast military conquest was needed to enforce an alien language and\r\nliterature, theology and system of law upon another people. And even\r\nmilitary conquest was not always sufficient, as witness the Assyrian\r\nand Persian conquests of Egypt, or the Roman conquest of Syria.\r\n\r\nWe now have monumental testimony that such domination there actually\r\nwas. As far back as B.C. 3800, Sargon of Akkad had founded a\r\nSemitic empire which had its centre in Babylon, and which stretched\r\nacross Asia to the shores of the Mediterranean. We learn from his\r\nannals that three campaigns were needed to subdue “the land of the\r\nAmorites,” as Syria and Palestine were called, and that at last, after\r\nthree years of warfare, all the coast-lands of “the sea of the setting\r\nsun” acknowledged his sway. He set up an image of himself on the Syrian\r\ncoast in commemoration of his victories, and moulded his conquests\r\n“into one” great empire. His son and successor, Naram-Sin, extended his\r\nconquests into the Sinaitic peninsula, and a seal-cylinder, on which he\r\nis adored as a god, has been found in Cyprus. But Sargon was a patron\r\nof literature as well as a conqueror; his court was filled with learned\r\nmen, and one of the standard works of Babylonian literature is said\r\nto have been compiled during his reign. The extension of Babylonian\r\nrule, therefore, to Western Asia meant the extension of Babylonian\r\ncivilization, an integral part of which was its script.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: VIEW OF THE TEMPLE OF UR IN ITS PRESENT STATE,\r\n  ACCORDING TO LOFTUS.]\r\n\r\nHere, then, is an explanation of the archæological fact that the graves\r\nof the copper and early bronze age in Cyprus, which mark the beginning\r\nof civilization in the country, contain numerous seal-cylinders made in\r\nimitation of those of Babylonia.[118] Examples of the seal-cylinders\r\nfrom which they were copied have also been discovered there. Among\r\nthem is the cylinder on which Naram-Sin is adored as a god, another is\r\nan extremely fine specimen of the style that was current in the age\r\nof Sargon of Akkad.[119] Along with the seal-cylinder it is probable\r\nthat the clay tablet was also introduced to the people of the\r\nWest. Though the clay tablets found by Dr. Evans and others in Krete\r\nmay not go back to so remote a date, the linear Kretan characters\r\nbelong to the same system of writing as the Cypriote syllabary, and an\r\ninscription in the letters of this syllabary on a seal-cylinder from\r\nthe early copper-age cemetery of Paraskevi near Nikosia has recently\r\nbeen published by myself.[120] We may infer that the prototypes of the\r\ntablets of Knossos or Phæstos once existed in Cyprus and Syria, though\r\nin the damp climate of the Mediterranean the unbaked clay of which they\r\nwere made has long since returned to its original dust.\r\n\r\nA few centuries after the age of Sargon of Akkad we find Gudea, a\r\nSumerian prince in Southern Babylonia, bringing limestone from “the\r\nland of the Amorites,” blocks of alabaster from the Lebanon, and beams\r\nof cedar from Mount Amanus, for his buildings in the city of Lagas.\r\nGold-dust and acacia wood were at the same time imported from the\r\n“salt” desert which lay between Palestine and Egypt, and stones from\r\nthe mountains of the Taurus, to the north-east of the Gulf of Antioch,\r\nwere floated down the Euphrates on rafts.[121] At a later date we hear\r\nof the kings of the Babylonian dynasty which had its capital at Ur,\r\nconducting military expeditions to the district of the Lebanon.\r\n\r\nAbout B.C. 2100 Northern Babylonia was occupied by a dynasty\r\nof kings, whose names show that they belonged to the Western division\r\nof the Semitic family. The language of Canaan--better known to us as\r\nHebrew--and that of Southern and North-eastern Arabia, were at the time\r\nsubstantially one and the same, and as the same deities were worshipped\r\nand the same ancestors were claimed throughout this portion of the\r\nSemitic world, Assyriologists are not agreed as to whether the dynasty\r\nin question should be regarded as coming from Canaan or from Southern\r\nArabia. The Babylonians themselves called the names Amorite, so it is\r\npossible that they would have pronounced the kings to have been Amorite\r\nalso. The point, however, is of little moment; the fact remains that\r\nNorthern Babylonia passed under the rule of sovereigns who belonged to\r\nthe Western and not to the Babylonian branch of the Semitic race, and\r\nwho made Babylon their capital. The contract tablets and other legal\r\ndocuments of this period show that Babylonia was at the time full of\r\nAmorite, that is Canaanite, settlers, most of whom had come there for\r\nthe sake of trade. At Sippara there was a district called “the field\r\nof the Amorites,” over which, therefore, they must have had full legal\r\nrights. Indeed, it would seem that in the eyes of the law the Amorite\r\nsettlers were on a complete footing of equality with the natives of the\r\ncountry.\r\n\r\nThis fact, so little in harmony with our ordinary idea of the\r\nexclusiveness of the ancient East, is largely explained by the further\r\nfact that Canaan and Syria were now acknowledged portions of the\r\nBabylonian Empire. When Babylonia was conquered by the Elamites,\r\nand the West Semitic king of Babylon allowed to retain his crown as\r\nan Elamite vassal, his claim to rule over “the land of the Amorites”\r\npassed naturally to his suzerain. Accordingly we find Chedor-laomer\r\nof Elam in the Book of Genesis marching to Canaan to put down a local\r\nrebellion there, while Eri-Aku, or Arioch, of Larsa, at the same date\r\ndescribes an Elamite prince as “governor of the land of the Amorites.”\r\nWhen Khammu-rabi, or Amraphel, the king of Babylon, at last succeeded\r\nin shaking off the Elamite yoke and making himself monarch of a\r\nfree and united Babylonia, “the land of the Amorites” followed the\r\nfortunes of Babylonia as a matter of course. On a monument discovered\r\nat Diarbekir, in Northern Mesopotamia, the only title taken by the\r\nBabylonian sovereign is that of “king of the land of the Amorites.”\r\nAnd the same title is borne by one at least of his successors in the\r\ndynasty.\r\n\r\nFor more than two thousand years, therefore, Western Asia was more or\r\nless closely attached to Babylonia. At times it was as much a part\r\nof the dominions of the Babylonian king as the cities of Babylonia\r\nitself, and it is consequently not surprising that it should have\r\nbecome thoroughly interpenetrated with Babylonian culture. There was\r\nan excellent postal service connecting Canaan with Babylonia which\r\nwent back to the days of Naram-Sin, and some of the clay _bullæ_\r\nwhich served as stamps for the official correspondence at that period\r\nare now in the Museum of the Louvre.[122] On the other hand, a clay\r\ndocket has been found in the Lebanon, dated in the reign of the son of\r\nKhammu-rabi, which contains one of the notices sent by the Babylonian\r\nGovernment to its officials at the beginning of each year, in order\r\nthat they might know what was its official title and date.[123]\r\n\r\nWhen this close connection between Babylonia and its Syrian provinces\r\nwas broken off we do not as yet know. Perhaps it did not take\r\nplace until the conquest of Babylonia by a horde of half-civilized\r\nmountaineers from Elam about B.C. 1800. At any rate, from this\r\ntime forward, though the influence of Babylonian culture continued,\r\nBabylonian rule in the West was at an end. From the Tel el-Amarna\r\ncorrespondence we learn that the Babylonian Government was still\r\ninclined to intrigue in Palestine; the memories of its ancient empire\r\nwere not altogether obliterated, and just as the English sovereigns\r\ncalled themselves kings of France long after they had ceased to possess\r\nan inch of French ground, so the Babylonian kings doubtless persuaded\r\nthemselves that they were still by right the rulers of Canaan.\r\n\r\nThe wild mountaineers from the Kossæan highlands who had conquered\r\nBabylon soon passed under the spell of Babylonian culture, and became\r\nthemselves Babylonian in habits, if not in name. They founded a dynasty\r\nwhich lasted for five hundred and seventy-six years and nine months. It\r\nis a curious coincidence that Egypt also was governed about the same\r\ntime by foreign conquerors, whose primitive wildness had been tamed\r\nby the influences of Egyptian civilization, which they had adopted as\r\nthe Kossæan mountaineers adopted that of Babylonia, and whose rule\r\nalso lasted for more than five hundred years. The Hyksos who conquered\r\nEgypt have been convincingly shown by recent discoveries to have been\r\nSemites, speaking a language of the West Semitic type.[124] They came\r\nfrom Canaan, and their conquest of Egypt made of it a dependency\r\nof Canaan. Hence they fixed their head-quarters in the northern\r\npart of their Egyptian territories, where they could easily keep up\r\ncommunication with Asia.\r\n\r\nThe excavations undertaken by the Palestine Exploration Fund at\r\nLachish, Gezer and other sites in Southern Canaan have made it clear\r\nthat throughout the Hyksos period Egypt and that part of Palestine\r\nwere closely connected with one another. How much further eastward\r\nthe government or influence of the Hyksos may have extended we do not\r\nknow; the figure of a lion inscribed with the name of a Hyksos Pharaoh\r\nhas been discovered in Babylonia, but this may have been brought from\r\nelsewhere. At any rate, so far as Palestine is concerned, we may say\r\nthat the Hyksos period in Egypt coincides with the disappearance of\r\nBabylonian rule in Canaan. From that time onward Canaan looks towards\r\nEgypt, and not towards Babylonia.\r\n\r\nBut even before the beginning of the Hyksos period Canaan--or at all\r\nevents Southern Canaan--is Egyptian rather than Babylonian. That has\r\nbeen abundantly proved by Mr. Macalister’s excavations at Gezer.\r\nObjects of the age of the Twelfth dynasty have been disinterred there,\r\nand of such a character as to make it evident that the country was\r\nalready subject to Egyptian influence long before the appearance of the\r\nHyksos. An Egyptian of that age was buried within the precincts of the\r\nconsecrated “high place,” and a stela commemorating him erected on the\r\nspot.\r\n\r\nBoth at Gezer and at Lachish it has been possible to trace the\r\narchæological chronology of the sites by the successive cities which\r\narose upon them. Gezer was the older settlement of the two; its history\r\ngoes back to the neolithic age, when it was inhabited by a race of\r\nshort stature who lived in caves and burned their dead, and whose\r\npottery was of the roughest description. Some of it was ornamented with\r\nstreaks of red or black on a yellow or red wash, like coarse pottery of\r\nthe age of the Third Egyptian dynasty which I have found in so-called\r\n“prehistoric” graves at El-Kab. Two settlements of the neolithic\r\npopulation can be made out, one resting upon the other; in the second\r\nthere was a distinct advance in civilization, and the place became a\r\ntown surrounded by a wall. The neolithic race was succeeded by a taller\r\nrace with Semitic characteristics, to whom the name of Amorite has\r\nbeen given; they buried the dead in a contracted position, and were\r\nacquainted with the use of copper and later of bronze. The city was\r\nnow defended by a solid wall of stone, intersected with brick towers;\r\nas Mr. Macalister observes, in a country where stone is the natural\r\nbuilding material the employment of brick must be due to foreign\r\ninfluence. He thinks the influence was Egyptian; this is very possible;\r\nbut considering that building with brick was a salient feature in\r\nBabylonian civilization, the influence may have come rather from the\r\nside of Babylonia.\r\n\r\nThe first “Amorite” city at Gezer was coeval with the earliest city\r\nat Lachish--the modern Tel el-Hesy, where the Amorite settlers had no\r\nneolithic predecessors. At Gezer their sanctuary has been discovered.\r\nIt was a “high place” formed of nine great monoliths running from north\r\nto south, and surrounded by a platform of large stones. The second\r\nmonolith, polished with the kisses of the worshippers, was possibly the\r\ncentral object of veneration, the _bœtylos_ or _beth-el_,\r\nas it was termed.[125] This _beth-el_, or “house of God,” takes\r\nus back to Semitic Babylonia. The veneration of isolated stones was\r\ncommon to all branches of the Semitic race; it may have come down\r\nto them from the days when their ancestors wandered over the desert\r\nplains of Arabia, where the solitary rocks assumed fantastic shapes\r\nthat appealed to their imagination and excited feelings of awe, while\r\ntheir shadows offered a welcome retreat in the heat of noon-day. In the\r\nhistorical age, however, it was not the rock itself that was adored,\r\nbut the divinity whose home it had become by consecration with oil.\r\nThe brick-built temple was called by the Babylonians a _bit-ili_,\r\n_beth-el_, or “house of God,” and the name was easily transferred\r\nto the consecrated stones, the worship of which was coeval with the\r\nbeginnings of Semitic history. But though the worship of stones\r\nwas primitive, the belief that the stone was not a fetish, but the\r\nshrine of divinity, belonged to an age of reflection and points to a\r\nBabylonian source.\r\n\r\nThe first Amorite city at Gezer was succeeded by a second, in which the\r\nhigh place underwent enlargement and was provided with a temenos. Under\r\nits pavement have been found memorials of the grim rites performed\r\nin honour of its Baal--the bones of children and even adults who\r\nhad been sacrificed and sometimes burnt and then deposited in jars.\r\nSimilar sacrifices, it would seem, were offered when a new building was\r\nerected, since children’s bones have been disinterred from under the\r\nfoundations of houses, both at Gezer and at Taanach and Megiddo. The\r\nbones were placed in jars along with lamps and bowls, which, it has\r\nbeen suggested, were intended to receive the blood of the victim. The\r\nold sacred cave of the neolithic race was now brought into connection\r\nwith the high place of the “Amorite” settlers, and the skeleton of a\r\nchild has been found in it resting on a flat stone.\r\n\r\nThis fourth city at Gezer--the second since the Semites first settled\r\nthere--has yielded objects which enable us to assign to it an\r\napproximate date. These objects are Egyptian, and belong to the age\r\nof the Twelfth dynasty. Many of them are scarabs, but there is also\r\nthe tombstone of the Egyptian who was buried under the shadow of the\r\nAmorite sanctuary. Fragments of diorite and alabaster vases also occur,\r\ntelling of trade with Egypt, and in the upper and later part of the\r\nstratum painted pottery makes its appearance similar to that met with\r\nin the corresponding stratum at Lachish. I shall have more to say about\r\nthis painted pottery in the next chapter; here it is sufficient to\r\nstate that it is related to the early painted pottery of the Ægean,\r\nbut is itself of Hittite origin, and can be traced back to the Hittite\r\ncentre in Cappadocia.\r\n\r\nThe fourth city had a long existence. It lasted from the period of the\r\nTwelfth Egyptian dynasty to the middle of the Eighteenth. Then it was\r\nruined by an enemy and its old wall partially destroyed--doubtless by\r\nThothmes III. when he conquered Palestine (about B.C. 1480).\r\nUpon its ruins rose another Amorite town. A new city wall was built of\r\nlarger circumference and greater strength; it measured fourteen feet in\r\nthickness, and the stones of which it was composed were large and well\r\nshaped. The houses erected on the _débris_ of the brick towers\r\nbelonging to the old wall were filled with scarabs, beads, fragments\r\nof pottery and other objects contemporary with the reign of Amon-hotep\r\nIII. (B.C. 1400). At Lachish the ruins of the third city\r\nwere full of similar objects, and among them was a cuneiform tablet\r\nin which reference is made to the governor of Lachish mentioned in\r\nthe Tel el-Amarna correspondence. At Taanach the Austrian excavators\r\ndiscovered an archive-chamber, the contents of which were of the same\r\nage. Taanach was merely a third-rate or fourth-rate town, but its\r\nshêkh possessed a fortified residence, in a subterranean chamber of\r\nwhich his official records and private correspondence were kept in a\r\ncoffer of terra-cotta. They were all in the Babylonian language and\r\nscript. Among them is a list of the number of men each landowner (?)\r\nwas required to furnish for the local militia, and there are also the\r\nletters which passed between the shêkh and his friends about their\r\nprivate affairs. How little of an official character is to be found in\r\nthese letters may be gathered from the following translation of one of\r\nthem: “To Istar-yisur (writes) Guli-Hadad.--Live happily! May the gods\r\ngrant health to yourself, your house and your sons! You have written\r\nto me about the money ... and behold I will give fifty pieces of\r\nsilver, since this has not (yet) been done.--Again: Why have you sent\r\nyour salutation here afresh? All you have heard there I have (already)\r\nlearned through Bel-ram.--Again: If the finger of the goddess Asherat\r\nappears, let them announce (the omen) and observe (it), and you shall\r\ndescribe to me both the sign and the fact. As to your daughter, we know\r\nthe one, Salmisa, who is in the city of Rabbah, and if she grows up,\r\nyou must give her to the prince; she is in truth fit for a lord.”[126]\r\n\r\nThese Taanach letters are a final proof, if any were needed, of the\r\ncompletely Babylonian nature of Canaanitish civilization in the\r\ncentury before the Exodus. When we find the petty shêkhs of obscure\r\nCanaanite towns corresponding with one another on the trivial matters\r\nof every-day life in the foreign language and syllabary of Babylonia,\r\nit is evident that Babylonian influence was still as strong in\r\nPalestine as it had been in the days when “the land of the Amorites”\r\nwas a Babylonian province. It is also evident that there must have been\r\nplenty of schools in which the foreign language and syllabary could be\r\ntaught and studied, and that the clay literature of Babylonia had been\r\ncarried to the West. Indeed the Tel el-Amarna collection contains proof\r\nof this latter fact. Along with the letters are fragments of Babylonian\r\nliterary works, one of which has been interpunctuated in order to\r\nfacilitate its reading by the Egyptian scholar.\r\n\r\nOn the other hand, apart from the cuneiform tablets the more strictly\r\narchæological evidence of Babylonian influence upon Canaan is\r\nextraordinarily scanty. Naturally we should discover no traces of\r\n“the goodly Babylonish garments” which, as we learn from the Book of\r\nJoshua, were imported into the country, the climate of Palestine not\r\nbeing favourable to their preservation; but it is certainly strange\r\nthat so few seal-cylinders or similar objects have been disinterred,\r\neither at Gezer and Lachish in the south, or at Taanach and Megiddo\r\nin the north. What makes it the stranger is that Mr. Macalister has\r\nopened a long series of graves, beginning with the neolithic race and\r\ncoming down to Græco-Roman times, and that while the influence of Egypt\r\nis sufficiently visible in them, that of Babylonia is almost entirely\r\nabsent. It is true that a few seal-cylinders have been met with in\r\nthe excavations on the city sites, but with the exception of one found\r\nat Taanach[127] I do not know of any that can be said to be of purely\r\nBabylonian manufacture; most of them are of Syrian make, and represent\r\na Syrian modification of the Babylonian type. And yet there are\r\nseal-cylinders from the Lebanon, now in the Ashmolean Museum at Oxford,\r\nwhich are purely Babylonian in origin, and belong to the period of\r\nKhammu-rabi.[128]--There are also two seal-cylinders of later pattern\r\nin M. de Clercq’s collection, on which are representations of the\r\nEgyptian gods Set and Horus--similar to those found on scarabs from the\r\nDelta of the time of the Eighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties--as well\r\nas of the Canaanite god Reshef, accompanied by cuneiform inscriptions\r\nwhich on palæographic grounds must be assigned to the age of the Tel\r\nel-Amarna tablets. As the inscriptions record the names of Hadad-sum\r\nand his son Anniy, “citizens of Sidon, the crown of the gods,” we\r\nknow that they have come from the Phœnician coast.[129] Like the\r\ncuneiform tablets, they bear witness to the long-continued influence of\r\nBabylonian culture in Canaan on its literary side.\r\n\r\nWhen we turn to theology and law, the same influence is recognizable.\r\nThe deities of Canaan were to a large extent Babylonian, with\r\nBabylonian names. The Babylonian gods Ana, Nebo, Rimmon (Rammân), Hadad\r\nand Dagon meet us in the names of places and persons, and Ashtoreth,\r\nwho shared with Baal the devotion of the inhabitants of Palestine,\r\nis the Babylonian Istar with the suffix of the feminine attached to\r\nher name. Even Asherah, in whom Semitic scholars were long inclined\r\nto see a genuinely Canaanitish goddess, turns out to have been of\r\nBabylonian origin, and to be the feminine counterpart of Asir, or\r\nAsur, the national god of Assyria. The recently-discovered legal code\r\nof Khammu-rabi has shown that such glimpses as we have in the Book of\r\nGenesis of the laws and legal customs of Canaan in the patriarchal age\r\nall presuppose Babylonian law. From time to time usages are referred\r\nto and laws implied which have no parallel in the Mosaic code, and are\r\ntherefore presumably pre-Israelite. But though they have no parallel\r\nin the Mosaic code, we have now learnt that they were all provided for\r\nin the code of Khammu-rabi. Thus Abram’s adoption of his slave and\r\nhouse-steward Eliezer is in strict accordance with the provisions of\r\nthe old Babylonian law. Adoption, indeed, which was practically unknown\r\namong the Israelites, was a leading feature in Babylonian life, and\r\nthe childless man was empowered to adopt an heir, even from among his\r\nslaves, to whom he left his name and his property. So, again, Sarai’s\r\nconduct in regard to Hagar, or Rachel’s conduct in regard to Bilhah, is\r\nexplained by the Babylonian enactment which allowed the wife to present\r\nher husband with a concubine; while we can now understand why Hagar was\r\nnot sold after her quarrel with Sarai, for the Babylonian law laid down\r\nthat “if a man has married a wife, and she has given a concubine to her\r\nhusband by whom he has had a child, should the concubine afterwards\r\nhave a dispute with her mistress because she has borne children, her\r\nmistress cannot sell her; she can only lay a task upon her and make her\r\nlive with the other slaves.”\r\n\r\nIn the account of Isaac’s marriage with Rebekah it is again a provision\r\nof the old Babylonian code with which we meet. There we hear of the\r\nbride receiving a dowry from the father of the bridegroom, and of other\r\npresents being made to her mother in conformity with Babylonian usage.\r\nSo, too, the infliction of death by burning with which Judah threatened\r\nhis daughter-in-law Tamar, on the supposition that she was a widow,\r\nhas its explanation in the legislation of Khammu-rabi, where the same\r\npunishment is enacted against a nun who has been unfaithful to her\r\nvows of virginity or widowhood. The story of the purchase of the cave\r\nof Machpelah, moreover, has long been recognized by Assyriologists as\r\npre-supposing an acquaintance with the legal forms of a Babylonian sale\r\nof land in the Khammu-rabi age.\r\n\r\nWith all this heritage of Babylonian culture, therefore, it is curious\r\nthat the excavators in Palestine have come across so few material\r\nevidences of intercourse with Babylonia. Mr. Macalister is inclined\r\nto believe that it must belong to a period anterior to the Twelfth\r\nEgyptian dynasty. But this raises a chronological question of some\r\ndifficulty. We have seen that the earlier and inner city wall of\r\nGezer served as the defence of three successive settlements, and\r\nthat it was partially destroyed along with the city it protected\r\nabout B.C. 1480. Now the outer and more massive wall which\r\nsuperseded it also served to protect three cities, the latest of which\r\nwas deserted during the Maccabean period, about B.C. 100.\r\nHence, Mr. Macalister argues, “if we may assume the rate of growth to\r\nhave been fairly uniform, we are led back to B.C. 2900 as the\r\n(latest) date” for the foundation of the first wall. During this long\r\nperiod of time twenty-eight feet of _débris_ accumulated; below\r\nthis are as much as twelve feet of neolithic accumulation.[130]\r\n\r\nThe conquests of Sargon of Akkad would accordingly have fallen within\r\nthe neolithic epoch. But in this case it is strange that the use\r\nof copper, with which Babylonia had long been acquainted, was not\r\ncommunicated to its Western province, and that it should have needed a\r\nnew race and the lapse of nearly a thousand years for its introduction.\r\nMoreover, specific evidences of Babylonian civilization are quite as\r\nmuch wanting in the remains of the first Amorite city as they are\r\nin those of the second. And unless we adopt a date for the Twelfth\r\nEgyptian dynasty, which on other grounds seems out of the question, it\r\nis hard to see how the Khammu-rabi dynasty can be placed before it.\r\nWhat little evidence we possess at present goes to indicate that the\r\nKhammu-rabi dynasty was contemporaneous with the earlier Hyksos kings\r\nor their immediate predecessors. And yet not only do we know that\r\nthe Khammu-rabi dynasty ruled in Palestine, but the adoption of the\r\ncuneiform script, which was at least as old as the age of that dynasty,\r\nas well as the testimony of theology and law, proves that its rule\r\nmust have exercised a profound and permanent influence upon the people\r\nof Canaan. How is it, then, that while the excavations have brought to\r\nlight so many evidences of Egyptian domination, there is so little in\r\nthe way of material objects to show that Palestine was once and for\r\nseveral centuries a Babylonian province?[131]\r\n\r\nPerhaps the excavations which are still proceeding at Megiddo may\r\nthrow some light upon the problem. Meanwhile, we may remember that\r\nthus far the greater part of the objects that have been found belong\r\nto the less wealthy and educated part of the population. The annals\r\nof Thothmes III. prove that, so far as the upper classes were\r\nconcerned, the picture of Canaanitish luxury presented in the Old\r\nTestament had a foundation of fact. Among the spoils taken from the\r\nprinces of Canaan we hear of tables, chairs and staves of cedar and\r\nebony inlaid or gilded with gold, of a golden plough and sceptre, of\r\nrichly-embroidered stuffs similar to those depicted on the walls of the\r\nEgyptian monuments, of chariots chased with silver, of iron tent-poles\r\nstudded with precious stones, and of “bowls with goats’ heads on them,\r\nand one with a lion’s head, the workmanship of the land of the Zahi,”\r\nthat is to say, of the Canaanitish coast. These latter were doubtless\r\nimitations of the gold and silver cups with double handles and animals’\r\nheads imported from Krete, which were also received as tribute from\r\nthe Canaanitish princes by the Egyptian king. Other gifts comprised\r\nchariots plated with gold, iron armour with gold inlay, a helmet of\r\ngold inlaid with lapis-lazuli, the tusks of elephants, rings of gold\r\nand silver that were used as money, copper and lead, as well as jars\r\nof wine, oil and balsam. Of all these articles, the copper and lead\r\nexcepted, it is needless to say next to nothing has been discovered by\r\nthe excavators. The most valuable work of art yet met with is a bronze\r\nsword of precisely the same shape as one found in Assyria, which bears\r\nupon it the name of Hadad-nirari I. (B.C. 1330).[132]\r\n\r\nOn the palæographical side the forms of the cuneiform characters used\r\nin Canaan go back to the script of the age of Khammu-rabi and his\r\npredecessors. From a purely Assyriological point of view, no regard\r\nbeing had to other considerations, I should date their introduction\r\ninto Palestine about B.C. 2300. The chronology that would\r\nbest harmonize the historical facts would thus be one which made the\r\ndominance of Egypt in Palestine under the Twelfth dynasty precede the\r\nBabylonian rule of the Khammu-rabi period. Against it is the negative\r\nevidence of archæological discovery, so few traces of this rule having\r\nbeen discovered in the course of the excavations. But neither in\r\narchæology nor in anything else is negative evidence of much value.\r\n\r\nAt any rate, thanks to the decipherment of the cuneiform inscriptions,\r\nthe main facts are clear. Canaan was once a province of the Babylonian\r\nEmpire, and during the long period of time that this was the case\r\nit became permeated with the literary culture of Babylonia. The\r\ncivilization which was partially destroyed by the Israelitish invasion\r\nhad its roots in the valley of the Euphrates.\r\n\r\nGezer, it is true, was one of the cities in which no visible break with\r\nthe past was made by the irruption of the desert tribes. It escaped\r\ncapture by the invaders, and it was only in the reign of Solomon,\r\nwhen the Israelites had already entered into the heritage of the old\r\nCanaanitish culture, that it was handed over by the king of Egypt to\r\nhis Jewish son-in-law. But at Lachish the marks of the destruction of\r\nthe town by Joshua are still visible. Above the ruins of the Amorite\r\ncities is a bed of ashes left by the charcoal-burners who squatted\r\non the site before it was again rebuilt. Above the stratum of ashes\r\nall must be Israelitish, and the objects found in the remains of the\r\ncities that stand upon it testify accordingly to a complete change.\r\nNo more cuneiform tablets are met with, and but few Egyptian scarabs;\r\nthe pottery is different, and the “high place” has disappeared.\r\nThe bowl and lamp, indeed, are still buried under the walls of the\r\nnewly-built house, but the bones of sacrificed children which they once\r\ncontained are replaced by sand. As the Israelitish power increased\r\nthe old Babylonian influence necessarily lessened. When the cuneiform\r\nsyllabary finally made way for the so-called Phœnician alphabet is\r\nstill uncertain, but it was at all events before the days of Solomon.\r\nAlready in the Amorite period the characters of the Kretan linear\r\nscript discovered by Dr. Evans are found scratched on fragments of\r\npottery, indicating that besides the cuneiform another form of writing\r\nwas known; it may be that the Israelitish conquest, by destroying the\r\ncentres of Canaanitish civilization and the schools of the scribes,\r\ngave a first blow to the tradition of Babylonian learning, and that the\r\nwork of destruction was subsequently completed by the Philistine wars.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VI\r\n\r\n                              ASIA MINOR\r\n\r\n\r\nIf it has been a surprise to learn that Palestine was once within\r\nthe circle of Babylonian culture, it has been equally a surprise to\r\nlearn that Asia Minor was so too. It is true that Herodotus traced the\r\nHerakleid dynasty of Lydian kings to the gods of Nineveh and Babylon,\r\nthat Strabo knew of a “mound of Semiramis” in Cappadocia, and that in\r\nthe Book of Genesis Lud is called the son of Shem. But historians had\r\nlong agreed that all such beliefs were creations of a later day, and\r\nrested on no substratum of fact. The northern limits of Babylonian\r\nor Assyrian influence, it was held, were fixed by the Taurus and the\r\nmountains of Kurdistan.\r\n\r\nThe discovery of cuneiform inscriptions on the stones and rocks of\r\nArmenia made the first breach in this conclusion. Their existence was\r\nknown even before Botta and Layard had opened up Nineveh. In 1826\r\nSchulz had been sent by the French Government at the instance of M.\r\nMohl to copy the mysterious characters which had already excited the\r\nattention of Oriental writers. Schulz was unexpectedly successful in\r\nhis quest. The number of inscriptions he discovered was far larger\r\nthan had been imagined, and his copies of them, as we now know, were\r\nremarkably accurate. But the explorer himself never lived to return\r\nto Europe. He was murdered by a Kurdish chief, Nurallah Bey, in 1829,\r\nwhile engaged in the work of exploration; his papers, however, were\r\neventually recovered, and the inscriptions he had copied were published\r\nin 1840 in the Journal of the Société Asiatique. One of them was a\r\ntrilingual inscription of Xerxes, the Persian transcript of which was\r\njust beginning to be deciphered; the rest were still a closed book.\r\n\r\nThen came the discovery of Nineveh and the first essays at the\r\ninterpretation of the Assyro-Babylonian texts. Layard himself made\r\nan expedition to Armenia, and besides recopying Schulz’s texts and\r\ncorrecting certain inaccuracies in them, added considerably to the\r\ncollection. Dr. Hincks, with his usual genius for decipherment,\r\nperceived that the syllabary in which they were written was the same as\r\nthat used at Nineveh, and utilized them for determining the values of\r\nsome of the Assyrian characters. He succeeded in reading most of the\r\nproper names, in assigning the inscriptions to a group of kings whose\r\norder he was able to fix, and in pointing out that many of them contain\r\nan account of military campaigns and of the amount of booty which had\r\nbeen carried off. But it was also clear that the inscriptions were not\r\nin a Semitic language, and as the nominative and accusative of the noun\r\nseemed to terminate in _-s_ and _-n_, while the patronymic\r\nwas expressed by the suffix _-khinis_, the decipherer assumed\r\nthat the language was Indo-European. The most important texts had been\r\nfound in or near Van, which had apparently been the capital of the\r\nkings by whose orders they had been engraved, and the name of Vannic,\r\naccordingly, was given to both texts and language.\r\n\r\nIt was soon recognized that Dr. Hincks had been in error in suggesting\r\nthat the Vannic language was Indo-European. It was, it is true,\r\ninflectional, but with this any resemblance to the languages of the\r\nIndo-European family ceased. Nor was there any other language or group\r\nof languages to which it appeared to be related, and all attempts\r\nfailed to advance the decipherment much beyond the point at which\r\nit had been left by Hincks. Thanks to the “determinatives,” which\r\nindicate proper names and the like, and the ideographs, which are\r\nfairly plentiful, the general sense of many of the inscriptions could\r\nbe made out; but beyond that it seemed impossible to go. Lenormant,\r\nindeed, following Hincks, showed that the suffix _-bi_ denoted the\r\nfirst person singular of the verb, and indicated Georgian as possibly a\r\nrelated language; but in the hands of other would-be decipherers, like\r\nRobert and Mordtmann, there was retrogression instead of advance.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n      THE GARDENS AND HILL OF DHUSPAS OR VAN.]\r\n\r\nSo matters remained until 1882, when Stanislas Guyard pointed out the\r\nparallelism between a formula which occurs at the end of many Vannic\r\ninscriptions and the imprecatory formula of the Assyrian texts. I had\r\nalready been struck by the same fact, and was at the time preparing a\r\nMemoir on the decipherment and translation of the inscriptions, which\r\nshortly afterwards appeared in the _Journal of the Royal Asiatic\r\nSociety_. In this I had made use of Layard’s copies, which had never\r\nbeen published; other copies also, including photographs, squeezes\r\nand casts, had been placed at my disposal, and in 1882 I was able to\r\nlay before cuneiform scholars a grammar and vocabulary of the Vannic\r\nlanguage, together with translations and analyses of all the known\r\ntexts.[133] These have been subsequently corrected and extended by\r\nother Assyriologists--Guyard, D. H. Müller, Nikolsky, Scheil, Belck\r\nand Lehmann, as well as by myself. An ordinary Vannic text can now\r\nbe translated with nearly as much completeness and certainty as an\r\nAssyrian text, and the number of them known to us has been greatly\r\nenlarged by the archæological explorations of Belck and Lehmann.\r\n\r\nIn the decipherment of the Vannic inscriptions the ideographs and\r\ndeterminatives which are scattered through them took the place for me\r\nof a bilingual text. The determinatives told me what was the nature of\r\nthe words which followed or preceded them, and so explained the general\r\nsense of the passages in which they occurred, while from time to time a\r\nphonetically-written word would be replaced in a parallel passage by an\r\nideograph the signification of which was known. I soon found, moreover,\r\nthat the cuneiform syllabary must have been brought from Nineveh to Van\r\nin the age of Assur-natsir-pal II. (B.C. 884–859), and that\r\nthe actual phrases met with in the inscriptions of that monarch are\r\nsometimes reproduced in a Vannic dress. The Vannic language, however,\r\nstill remains isolated, though the majority of those who have studied\r\nit incline to Lenormant’s view that its nearest living representative\r\nis Georgian. Not being a Georgian scholar myself, this is a point upon\r\nwhich I can express no opinion.\r\n\r\nInstead of “Vannic,” it has been proposed to call the language\r\n“Khaldian.” The chief god of the people who spoke the language was\r\nKhaldis, and in the inscriptions we find the people themselves\r\ndescribed as “the children of Khaldis.” Derivatives from the name are\r\nfound employed in a geographical sense northward of the region to which\r\nthe inscriptions belong. Thus the Khaldi “in the neighbourhood of\r\nColchis” are said to have been also called Khaldæi;[134] “Khaldees” are\r\nfrequently referred to by Armenian writers as living between Trapezont\r\nand Batûm, and a Turkish inscription at Sumela shows that as late as\r\nthe beginning of the fifteenth century Lazistân was still known as\r\nKhaldia. That the name was ever applied, however, to the kingdom which\r\nhad its chief seat at Van is not proved, and it is therefore best to\r\nadhere to the term “Vannic,” which commits those who use it to no\r\ntheory.[135]\r\n\r\nThe decipherment of the Vannic texts has not only led to the discovery\r\nof a new language, it has also thrown a flood of light on the early\r\nhistory, geography and religion of the Armenian plateau. The military\r\ncampaigns of the Assyrian kings had brought it into contact with\r\nAssyrian civilization, and in the ninth century before our era a\r\ndynasty arose which adopted the literary culture and art of Assyria,\r\nand founded a powerful kingdom which extended its sway from Urumia on\r\nthe east to Malatia on the west, and from the slopes of Ararat and the\r\nshores of Lake Erivan to the northern frontiers of Assyria.\r\n\r\nThe main fact which has thus been disclosed is that the Armenians of\r\nhistory--the Aryan tribes, that is to say, who spoke an Indo-European\r\nlanguage--did not enter the country and establish themselves in the\r\nplace of its older rulers before the end of the seventh century before\r\nour era. The fall of the Vannic monarchy seems to have coincided with\r\nthe fall of the Assyrian Empire, with which it had once contended on\r\nalmost equal terms, and in each case the invasion of the so-called\r\nScythian hordes from the plains of Eastern Europe had much to do with\r\nthe result. The founders of Armenian civilization and of the cities of\r\nthe Armenian plateau had no connection with the Indo-European family.\r\nTheir type of language corresponded with that which distinguishes most\r\nof the actual languages of the Caucasus, though no genetic relationship\r\nis traceable between them. The break with the past, however, occasioned\r\nby the irruption of the Indo-European invaders, was so great that not\r\nonly did the older language become extinct and forgotten, but even the\r\ntradition of the older civilization was also lost. Like the recovery of\r\nthe Sumerian language and the culture it represented, the recovery of\r\nthe Vannic language and culture is the revelation of a new world.\r\n\r\nAt the head of the pantheon was a trinity consisting of Khaldis, the\r\nsupreme god of the race; Teisbas, the god of the air; and the Sun-god\r\nArdinis. Temples were erected in their honour, and shields and spears\r\ndedicated to their service. The vine, which grows wild in Armenia,\r\nwas the sacred tree of the people, and there are inscriptions which\r\ncommemorate its planting and consecration, and describe the endowments\r\nthat were set apart for its maintenance. Wine was naturally offered\r\nto the gods along with the domestic animals and prisoners of war. Dr.\r\nBelck has discovered burial-places which go back to the neolithic age,\r\nbut the majority of the monuments scattered over the Vannic area belong\r\nto the bronze age, and testify to a native adaptation of Assyrian art\r\nand culture. Iron also makes its appearance, but scantily. The pottery\r\nof the age of the inscriptions is related on the one side to the\r\nAssyrian pottery of the same period, and on the other to the pottery\r\nof Asia Minor. The polished red ware more especially points to the\r\nwest.[136]\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n      THE RUINS OF A PALACE OF URARTU AT TOPRAK-KALEH.]\r\n\r\nThe existence of a language of the Caucasian type in Armenia, and its\r\nassociation with a powerful kingdom and an advanced culture, is not\r\nthe only revelation of the kind that we owe to cuneiform decipherment.\r\nWe have learned that at a much earlier epoch Northern Mesopotamia was\r\noccupied by a people who spoke a language of similar type but of far\r\nmore complicated form; and that here, too, the language in question was\r\naccompanied by a high civilization, a powerful monarchy, and the\r\nuse of the cuneiform syllabary. The monarchy was that of Mitanni, and\r\nits culture and script had been borrowed from Babylonia in the age of\r\nKhammu-rabi, instead of from Assyria in the age of Assur-natsir-pal.\r\nBut it is interesting to observe that in borrowing the script the\r\npeople of Mitanni had adapted and simplified it in precisely the same\r\nway as did the people of Van in after days. Superfluous characters were\r\ndiscarded, a single phonetic value only assigned to each character,\r\nand large use made of those which expressed vowels. In fact, in\r\nboth Mitannian and Vannic the system of writing begins to approach\r\nthe alphabetic. Whether this similarity in adaptation was due to a\r\nsimilarity of phonetic structure in the two languages or to conscious\r\nimitation on the part of the Vannic scribes it is difficult to say; it\r\nis a point, however, which cannot be passed over.\r\n\r\nThe name of Mitanni meets us on the Egyptian monuments of the\r\nEighteenth and Nineteenth dynasties. The kingdom played a considerable\r\npart at that period of time in the politics of Western Asia, and the\r\ndaughters of its kings were married to the Egyptian Pharaohs. The\r\nboundaries of the Egyptian Empire were coterminous with those of\r\nMitanni, and we gather from the Tel el-Amarna correspondence that the\r\nMitannian forces had more than once made their way into Palestine,\r\nperhaps as far south as Jerusalem, and that Mitannian intrigue\r\nwas active in that portion of the Pharaoh’s dominions. Among the\r\nCanaanitish governors are some who bear Mitannian names, and testify to\r\nthe continuance of a Mitannian element in that common meeting-place of\r\nnationalities.\r\n\r\nSeveral letters from the Mitannian king have been found among the\r\nTel el-Amarna tablets. Most of them are written in the Babylonian\r\nlanguage, but one--and fortunately an exceptionally long one--though\r\nin cuneiform characters, is in the native language of the country.\r\nA comparison of it with its companion letters, assisted by the\r\ndeterminatives and ideographs which are employed in it from time to\r\ntime, has enabled Jensen, Leopold Messerschmidt and myself to decipher\r\na very considerable part of the letter, and so to compile a grammar and\r\nvocabulary of the Mitannian language. That it is distantly related to\r\nVannic seems to admit of little doubt, but it comes before us in a much\r\nmore developed form; indeed, its system of suffixes is so elaborate and\r\nponderous as to remind us of the polysynthetic languages of America.\r\n\r\nA legal document found in Babylonia and dated in the epoch of\r\nKhammu-rabi contains a number of proper names which are of Mitannian\r\nor allied origin, and show that persons of that race were already\r\nsettled in Babylonia.[137] As the Mitannian form of cuneiform script\r\nmust have been borrowed about the same time, we may infer that the\r\nadvanced guard of the northern race had already made its way as far\r\nsouth as Mesopotamia, and there established its power in the midst of\r\na Semitic population. From that time forward a constant struggle went\r\non between the two races, the Semitic race striving to push back the\r\nnorthern intruders and planting its own colonies in the very heart of\r\nthe northern area, while the northerners pressed ever more and more to\r\nthe southward, and at one time even seemed likely to possess themselves\r\nof the heritage of the Babylonian Empire in Western Asia. Like Armenia,\r\nNorthern Mesopotamia was occupied by a people of Caucasian and Asianic\r\naffinities, whose armies had crossed the Euphrates and won territory in\r\nSyria and Palestine.\r\n\r\nOn the west, however, the Mitannians found themselves confronted by\r\nanother northern population, the Hittites, whose first home was in\r\nCappadocia. The Hittites also had passed under the spell of Babylonian\r\nculture, and the cuneiform script had been carried to them at an early\r\ndate. Thanks to recent discoveries, we can now trace in some measure\r\nthe earlier fortunes of a race who made a profound impression, not only\r\non the future history of Asia Minor and its relations with Greece, but\r\nalso on the history of Palestine.\r\n\r\nAs far back as about B.C. 2000, Babylonian or Assyrian troops\r\nhad already made their way along the northern banks of the Tigris\r\nand Euphrates to the borders of Cappadocia and the neighbourhood\r\nof the Halys. I say Babylonian or Assyrian, for Assyria was at the\r\ntime a province of Babylonia, though as the colonies which settled\r\nin the track of the invaders were distinctively Assyrian in their\r\nmunicipal customs and the names of their inhabitants, the troops were\r\nprobably drafted from Assyria.[138] The mineral wealth of Cappadocia\r\nwas doubtless the attraction which led them to such distant and\r\nsemibarbarous lands; Dr. Gladstone’s analysis of the gold of the Sixth\r\nEgyptian dynasty, with its admixture of silver, has shown that it was\r\nimported from the north of Asia Minor,[139] and the silver itself was\r\nprobably already worked. Further south, in the Taurus, were mines of\r\ncopper.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the remains of one of these early\r\nAssyro-Babylonian colonies has been partially excavated a few miles\r\n(twenty-three kilometres) to the north-east of Kaisariyeh.[140] The\r\nsite is now known as Kara Eyuk, “the Black Mound,” and numerous\r\ncuneiform tablets have come from it. It has obtained its present name\r\nfrom the marks of fire which are everywhere visible upon it, and bear\r\neloquent testimony to its final fate. Established as an outpost of\r\nthe Assyrian Empire in the distant west, a time came when, deserted\r\nby the Government at home, its strong walls were battered down by the\r\nbesieging foe and the Assyrian settlers massacred among the ruins\r\nof their burning town. According to M. Chantre, its excavator (who,\r\nhowever, believes that it was destroyed by a volcanic eruption), the\r\nwhole mound is a mass of charred and burnt remains.\r\n\r\nThe construction of the walls, as well as the pottery found within\r\nthem, marks it off with great distinctness from the ruins of the\r\nHittite or native Cappadocian cities in its neighbourhood. While in\r\ntheir case the city wall is made of unmortared blocks of stone, the\r\nwalls of Kara Eyuk are built of brick, and where stones are used\r\nthey are of small size and cemented with mortar. The pottery differs\r\nconsiderably from that of the Hittite capital at Boghaz Keui. Some\r\nof it is of black ware, especially characterized by the vases with\r\nlong spouts, which are also found in Phrygia and the Troad. Some of\r\nit, again, is of the dark-red lustrous ware which has been met with\r\nat Toprak Kaleh, near Van, and Boz Eyuk in Phrygia, while the yellow\r\nware with geometrical patterns in black and maroon-red which has been\r\ndiscovered in Phrygia occurs in large quantities. This latter ware is\r\nof the class known as “Mykenæan.”[141]\r\n\r\nThe cuneiform tablets which have come from the site are known as\r\n“Cappadocian,” and were first noticed by Dr. Pinches. The forms of the\r\ncharacters resemble those of the early Babylonian script, which was\r\nstill used in Assyria in the age of Khammu-rabi. Many of the proper\r\nnames, moreover, seem to be distinctive of that period. On the other\r\nhand, a large proportion of them contain the name of Asur--often in its\r\nprimitive form of Asir--or are otherwise characteristic of Assyria.\r\nThe tablets are further dated by the archons who gave their names to\r\nthe years, a system of chronology which was peculiar to Assyria and\r\nunknown in Babylonia, while the month was divided into “weeks” of five\r\ndays each. The language of the tablets also, which is full of dialectic\r\nmispronunciations and strange words, points to Assyria rather than to\r\nthe southern kingdom, and we may therefore conclude that the colonists\r\nwere Assyrians, even though the colony may have been founded when\r\nAssyria was still a Babylonian province.\r\n\r\nThere are indications in the Assyrian inscriptions themselves that\r\nthe road to Cappadocia was known to the Assyrian princes at an early\r\nepoch. The earliest Assyrian kings whose annals have come down to us\r\nare Hadad-nirari I. and his son Shalmaneser I. (B.C. 1300).\r\nHadad-nirari tells us that his greatgrandfather, Assur-yuballidh, whose\r\nletters form part of the Tel el-Amarna correspondence, had subdued\r\n“the wide-spread” province of Subari, which lay near the sources of\r\nthe Euphrates, and in which Kara Eyuk was perhaps included, while he\r\nhimself restored the cities of the same province which had fallen into\r\nruin. Later, Shalmaneser I. conducted campaign after campaign towards\r\nthe same region. In his second year he overthrew the king of Malatia,\r\nand the combined forces of the other “Hittite” states, who had come to\r\nhis assistance: “all were conquered,” from the borders of Cappadocia\r\nto the Hittite stronghold of Carchemish. A military colony was settled\r\nat the head waters of the Tigris which secured the high-road to Asia\r\nMinor.\r\n\r\nTwo centuries later we learn from Tiglath-pileser I. that Moschians and\r\nHittites had overrun part of this Assyrian territory, and occupied some\r\nof the Assyrian settlements. Once more, therefore, the Assyrian troops\r\nmarched to the north-west; the provinces which lay in the valley of the\r\nMurad-chai were recovered, and the old province of Subari cleared of\r\nintruders. Soon afterwards Tiglath-pileser forced his way into Southern\r\nCappadocia and the valley of the Sarus, making Comana tributary, razing\r\nto the ground the fortresses that had resisted him, and erecting\r\non their site chambers of brick, with bronze tablets on which his\r\nconquests were recorded. Eastern Cilicia was known at the time to the\r\nAssyrians as Muzri, or “the Marchland,” a clear proof that it had long\r\nformed a borderland and debatable territory between the Assyrian Empire\r\nand the nations of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nIt is thus evident that even before the rise of the Assyrian monarchy,\r\nthe road that led to the mining districts of Cappadocia, along the\r\nvalleys of the Upper Tigris, Euphrates and Tokhma Su, was not only\r\nknown to the Assyro-Babylonians, but had actually constituted Assyrian\r\nterritory, which was colonized by Assyrian garrisons and paid tribute\r\nto Nineveh whenever Assyria was strong enough to enforce its authority.\r\nAt the eastern extremity of the road stood the city of unknown name,\r\nnow represented by “the Burnt Mound” of Kara Eyuk, whose existence as\r\nan Assyro-Babylonian city probably dates back to the age of Khammu-rabi.\r\n\r\nIt was the outpost of Babylonian culture in Asia Minor. Babylonian\r\nart, and, above all, the Babylonian system of writing, were brought by\r\nit into the heart of the Hittite region, and the archæological objects\r\nfound there consequently become important for chronological dating. Not\r\nfar off, on the other side of the Halys, rose the Hittite capital, now\r\nknown as Boghaz Keui, the centre from which, as Professor Ramsay has\r\nshown,[142] the early roads of Asia Minor radiated in all directions.\r\n\r\nBoghaz Keui is being excavated at the present moment. Hundreds of\r\nclay tablets have already been found there, inscribed with cuneiform\r\ncharacters, the majority of which are in the native Hittite language,\r\nthough many are in Semitic Babylonian, including a copy of the famous\r\ntreaty between Ramses II. and the Hittite king. So far as the tablets\r\nhave been examined, they show that the Hittite empire extended from the\r\nwest of Asia Minor to the Egyptian frontier, and that the cuneiform\r\ncharacters were used in ordinary life.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration:\r\n\r\n      THE RUINS AT BOGHAZ KEUI.]\r\n\r\nBy one of those coincidences which sometimes happen in archæological\r\nresearch, the discovery fits with another fact which had long been\r\nin the possession of the Assyriologist, though the full meaning of\r\nit was unknown to him. Among the Tel el-Amarna letters are two in a\r\nlanguage unlike any with which we are acquainted. One of them is from a\r\nHittite leader of condottieri,[143] who has left us two other letters\r\nwhich are in the Assyrian language, and who came from a town in the\r\nneighbourhood of Cilicia. The second letter was written to the king of\r\nArzawa by one of the foreign secretaries of the Egyptian Government.\r\nBut the situation of Arzawa was wholly uncertain; as the king bore the\r\nHittite name of Tarkhundaraba, I suggested that it lay in the Hittite\r\nterritory, and that consequently in the language of the letter we had\r\na fragment of the Hittite language. For many years, however, this\r\nremained a mere conjecture, without any definite proofs.\r\n\r\nWhen the fragmentary tablets from Boghaz Keui came to be copied, it\r\nwas at once perceived that they were in a language which resembled\r\nthat of the Arzawa letters, but it was not until the new tablet\r\nfrom Constantinople had been cleaned and copied by Dr. Pinches and\r\nmyself that the actual facts became clear. The Arzawa and Boghaz Keui\r\ntexts agree in the forms given to the characters, in grammar and in\r\nvocabulary. Arzawa, therefore, must have been the Hittite kingdom which\r\nhad its centre at Boghaz Keui, and already in the age of the Eighteenth\r\nEgyptian dynasty it was employing a form of the cuneiform script which\r\nimplied a long preceding period of use and adaptation. A new realm has\r\nthus to be added to the domain of the cuneiform system of writing; in\r\nSyria the Hittite king of Kadesh wrote to the Pharaoh in Babylonian,\r\nbut in his old home in the north, though the Babylonian syllabary\r\nhad been adopted, the language it served to express was that of the\r\nHittites themselves.\r\n\r\nA certain amount of this Hittite language of Arzawa can be deciphered,\r\nthanks to those same determinatives and ideographs which have assisted\r\nso materially towards the decipherment of the Vannic texts, and more\r\nespecially to the recurrence in the two Tel el-Amarna letters of\r\nphrases that are common to the whole correspondence. The new tablet,\r\nhowever, is more than usually helpful, since it contains Assyrian words\r\nand grammatical forms which in parallel passages of the same text are\r\nreplaced by native equivalents. In this way a sketch of Arzawan grammar\r\ncan now be made, as well as a list of Arzawan words. The language which\r\nis thus disclosed is of an Asianic type, with features that remind us\r\nof Lycian on the one side, and of Mitannian and Vannic on the other.\r\nBut in what may be termed the fundamentals of grammar it agrees with\r\nMitannian and Vannic.\r\n\r\nAt the same time, certain of these same fundamentals have a curious but\r\nsuperficial resemblance to what we have hitherto been accustomed to\r\nregard as characteristics of Indo-European grammar. The nominative and\r\naccusative of the noun, for example, are distinguished by the suffixes\r\n_-s_ and _-n_, the plural nominative and accusative often terminate\r\nin _-s_, and the possessive pronouns of Arzawan are _mi-s_, “mine”;\r\n_ti-s_, “thine”; and _sa(s)_, “his”; while _si_ is “(to) her.” The\r\nthird person of the present tense ends in _-t_; _es-tu_, is “may it\r\nbe”; _es-mi_, “may I be.” Yet with all these remarkable coincidences, I\r\ncan assure the comparative philologist that Arzawan is certainly not an\r\nIndo-European language, and I must leave him to explain them as best\r\nhe may.\r\n\r\n  [Illustration: ONE OF THE PROCESSIONS IN THE RAVINE OF BOGHAZ.\r\n\r\n  (_See p. 174._)]\r\n\r\nWe have, however, learnt a good deal more about the Hittite populations\r\nof Asia Minor from the Tel el-Amarna tablets than the nature of the\r\nlanguage which they spoke. In the closing days of the Eighteenth\r\nEgyptian dynasty we find them on the southern side of the Taurus,\r\nsending forth bands of adventurers, who hired their services to the\r\nking of Egypt and to the rival governors and princes of Palestine,\r\nand from time to time carved out principalities of their own with the\r\nsword. We are even able to follow the fortunes of some of the leaders\r\nof the condottieri, who had no scruple in transferring their allegiance\r\nfrom one vassal prince to another when tempted by the prospect of\r\nbetter pay, or in murdering their employer when the opportunity\r\narose, and plundering or occupying his city. They had, it is true, a\r\nwholesome awe of Egyptian power and of the Egyptian army, and some of\r\nthe letters they wrote to the Egyptian court are amusing examples of\r\nthe excuses they offered for their misdeeds. But they never hesitated\r\nabout seizing the Pharaoh’s property when they thought they could do\r\nso with impunity, while they were all the time professing to be his\r\ndevoted slaves. A considerable number of the vassal princes of Canaan\r\nkept these mercenaries in their pay, and in many cases the Egyptian\r\nForeign Office thought it wisest to confirm one of their leaders in the\r\ngovernment of a district, however doubtful might have been the means by\r\nwhich it had come into his hands. So long as the tribute was paid, and\r\nthe imperial authority acknowledged, no further questions were asked.\r\nThe mercenaries were useful at times to the imperial forces, and the\r\nmutual jealousies and quarrels of the local governors were perhaps not\r\naltogether displeasing to the home Government.[144]\r\n\r\nIn this way bands of Hittite mercenaries came to be settled in\r\nvarious parts of Palestine, even in the extreme south. The sons of\r\nArzawaya, “the Arzawan,” established themselves in the neighbourhood\r\nof Jerusalem, whose king, by the way, seems to bear a Mitannian name.\r\nThe statement in the Book of Genesis that Heth was the son of Canaan\r\nreceives a new signification from the Tel el-Amarna tablets.\r\n\r\nBut Hittite influence in Southern Palestine goes back to an earlier\r\nepoch than the age of the tablets. The painted pottery found in the\r\n“Amorite” strata of Lachish and Gezer shows remarkable affinities\r\nto the pottery discovered by Chantre at Boghaz Keui, and Mr. J. L.\r\nMyres has succeeded in tracing it in a fairly continuous line to the\r\nregion north of the Halys.[145] Here was found the red ochre--or\r\n_sandarakê_, as it was called--which was used in the decoration\r\nof the pottery, and after the introduction of two other colours still\r\nremained the principal feature in the system of ornamentation. This\r\nHittite or Cappadocian pottery was carried westward along the road\r\nwhich led from Boghaz Keui towards the Troad, and south-eastwards\r\nacross the Taurus into Syria. It was probably the ultimate origin of\r\nthe painted Minoan or “Kamâres” pottery of Krete.\r\n\r\nThe introduction of Hittite pottery into Canaan where it tended to\r\nsupersede the native ware, was doubtless the result of trade. But in\r\nancient Asia the trader and the soldier were very apt to march side by\r\nside. The soldier opened the way for the trader and kept it for him,\r\nquite as much as the trader opened it for the soldier. Hence it is\r\nnot surprising that the Assyrian monuments should furnish incidental\r\nevidence of the Hittite occupation of Palestine at an early date. In\r\nthe inscriptions of Babylonia, as we have seen, Palestine and Syria\r\nare “the land of the Amorites”; the name went back to an immemorial\r\nantiquity, and indicates that at the time it was first given the\r\nAmorites were the ruling population in the West. But in the Assyrian\r\ninscriptions the place of the Amorites is taken by the Hittites. For\r\nthe Assyrians, Syria is “the land of the Hittites,” and in the later\r\nhistorical texts even the Israelites and Philistines are classed as\r\n“Hittite.”[146]\r\n\r\nCanaan, however, was already well known to the Assyrians in the age of\r\nthe Tel el-Amarna correspondence, when the ambassadors of the Assyrian\r\nking carried letters and presents through it to the Pharaoh. It must,\r\ntherefore, have been at a still earlier period that they first became\r\nacquainted with it, and at this period Hittite influence must have\r\nbeen so predominant as to cause them to discard the name of Amorite,\r\nconsecrated though it was by the long-continued usage of Babylonian\r\nliterature, and to employ instead of it the name of Hittite.\r\n\r\nBut it was in the direction of the Greek seas that Hittite influence\r\nwas most powerful. Through Asia Minor Babylonian culture penetrated to\r\nthe West. A native imitation of the Babylonian seal-cylinder was found\r\nby Dr. Schliemann in the ruins of Hissarlik,[147] and the so-called\r\n“heraldic” position of the lions at Mykenæ can be traced back through\r\nAsia Minor to the designs of the Babylonian gem-cutters. The winged\r\nhorse, Pegasus, is found on Hittite seals, and, like the double-headed\r\neagle of Eyuk and other composite figures, is derived from Babylonian\r\nprototypes.[148] They represented the first attempts of the creative\r\npower, as conceived of by Babylonian cosmology, and an old Babylonian\r\nlegend of the creation accordingly describes the monsters suckled\r\nby Tiamât as “warriors with the bodies of birds, men with the faces\r\nof ravens.”[149] The fantastic monsters of “Minoan” art, which have\r\nbeen brought to light by the excavations in Krete, claim an intimate\r\nconnection with the similar composite beings which are a characteristic\r\nof Hittite art.[150]\r\n\r\nThe early Hittite art of Asia Minor, as I pointed out many years ago,\r\nis dependent on that of Babylonia, and has little in common with the\r\nart of Assyria.[151] It is not until we come to the later Hittite\r\nmonuments of Cilicia and Syria that the influence of Assyrian art makes\r\nitself visible. Hence was derived the partiality of the Hittite artist\r\nfor the composite animals that adorn the seal-cylinders of Babylonia,\r\nand which consequently became known wherever the seal-cylinder and\r\nthe literary culture it accompanied had made their way. As I have\r\nalready stated, though Subari was an Assyrian province and Kara Eyuk\r\nan Assyrian colony, the form of the cuneiform script that was used in\r\nCappadocia was of Babylonian origin.\r\n\r\nThe writing material of “Minoan” Krete, we now know, consisted of clay\r\ntablets. The fact is a proof that the influence of Babylonian culture\r\nhad extended thus far. But it was an indirect influence only. Though\r\nthe clay tablet was employed, the characters impressed upon it were\r\nthe native Kretan. This in itself, however, demonstrates how strong\r\nthe influence must have been, for the Kretan characters, whether\r\nhieroglyphic or linear, were less easy to inscribe on clay than the\r\ncuneiform. Krete, moreover, is a land of rock and stone rather than of\r\nclay. We may infer, therefore, from the use of the Babylonian material\r\nthat the first impulse to write was inspired by the civilization of\r\nBabylonia.\r\n\r\nHow it was brought to Krete we do not know. It may have passed over\r\nfrom the shores of Canaan; it may have come from Cyprus or Asia Minor.\r\nA seal-cylinder, which I have lately published, and which was found in\r\nthe early copper-age cemetery of Agia Paraskevi in Cyprus, shows that\r\nthe so-called Cypriote syllabary was already in use in the island at\r\na remote date,[152] and this syllabary is closely connected with the\r\nlinear characters of Krete. Inscriptions in the same form of script\r\nhave been found on the site of Troy, and the pre-Israelitish pottery of\r\nSouthern Palestine is marked with signs which seem to be derived from\r\nit. So, too, is certain Egyptian pottery of the age of the Eighteenth\r\ndynasty, and even of the age of the Twelfth.[153]\r\n\r\nIt is possible that Krete was the birthplace of the picture writing\r\nwhich developed into the linear script of Knossos and the Cypriote\r\nsyllabary; it is possible that it was rather Cyprus. I do not think,\r\nas I once did, that it comes from Asia Minor, for Asia Minor had its\r\nown pictographic system, which we see represented in the Hittite\r\ninscriptions, and an increased knowledge of this system tends to\r\ndissociate it from the pictographs and syllabaries of Krete and Cyprus.\r\n\r\nWherever it arose, however, it was associated with the Babylonian\r\nwriting material and the Babylonian seal-cylinder. So far as our\r\npresent knowledge goes, Cyprus is more likely than any other part of\r\nthe world to have been the meeting-point of Babylonian culture and the\r\nnascent civilization of the West. The numerous seal-cylinders which\r\ncharacterize the early copper age of the island are native imitations\r\nof Babylonian seal-cylinders of the epoch of Sargon of Akkad, when the\r\nboundaries of the Babylonian Empire were pushed to the coasts of the\r\nMediterranean, if not into Cyprus itself, and the great eastern plain\r\nof Cyprus was better fitted to provide clay for the tablet than any\r\nother Mediterranean district with which I am acquainted.\r\n\r\nThat no written tablets have been found by the excavators in Cyprus\r\nis not surprising. In an island climate where heavy rains occur the\r\nunbaked tablet soon becomes hardly distinguishable from the earth in\r\nwhich it is embedded. It was almost by accident that even the practised\r\neye of Dr. A. J. Evans was first led to notice the clay tablets of\r\nKnossos.\r\n\r\nThe Greek term δέλτος, which was borrowed from the language of Canaan,\r\nis evidence that the tablet was once known to the Greeks. For the\r\nletters of the Phœnician and Greek alphabet rolls of papyrus or\r\nleather were needed; the fact that the writing material was a tablet\r\nand not a roll refers us back to Babylonia. With the introduction\r\nof the Phœnician letters the word δέλτος necessarily changed its\r\nmeaning, and became synonymous with a wooden board. But it is possible\r\nthat a reminiscence of its original signification is preserved in a\r\nfamous passage of the _Iliad_ (vi. 169), where the later “board”\r\nhas been substituted for the earlier “tablet.” Here we are told how\r\nBellerophon carried with him to Lycia “baleful signs”--which may have\r\nbeen the pictographs of Krete or the Hittites, or even cuneiform\r\ncharacters--written upon “a folded board.” The expression would have\r\nmost naturally originated in the folded clay tablet of early Babylonia,\r\nthe inner tablet being enclosed in an envelope on which the address or\r\na description of the contents of the document is written.\r\n\r\nOn the literary side, however, this is the utmost contribution that\r\nwe can claim for Babylonia to have made to historical Greece. In the\r\nsphere of religion it is possible that the anthropomorphism of Greece\r\nwas influenced by the anthropomorphism of Babylonia through Asia\r\nMinor, where the rock sculptures of Boghaz Keui show how the primitive\r\nHittite fetishes had become human deities like those of Chaldæa; in\r\nthe sphere of philosophy Thales and Anaximander clothed in a Greek\r\ndress the cosmological theories of the Babylonians; and in the domain\r\nof art the heraldry and composite monsters of Babylonia made their\r\nway to Europe, while the Ionic artists of Ephesus carved ivories into\r\nforms so Oriental in character that similar figures found in the palace\r\nof Sargon have been pronounced to be the work of Phœnicians. But the\r\nliterary culture of historical Greece did not begin until the tide of\r\nBabylonian influence had already rolled back from Western Asia, when\r\nthe Phœnician alphabet had taken the place of the cuneiform syllabary\r\nin Syria, and the Hittite populations of Asia Minor had returned to\r\ntheir clumsy hieroglyphs.\r\n\r\nIt is, however, remarkable how very nearly the cuneiform script became\r\nwhat the Phœnician alphabet has been called, “the mother of the\r\nalphabets of the world.” At one time it covered nearly the whole area\r\nof the civilized globe. A seal-cylinder with a cuneiform inscription in\r\nan unknown language has been discovered on the hills near Herat;[154]\r\nin the west its use extended as far as Cappadocia, perhaps further.\r\nNorthward it made its home in Armenia; southward it obliged even the\r\nEgyptian Foreign Office to employ it for correspondence, while military\r\nscribes wrote in it their memoranda of the Pharaoh’s campaigns. In\r\nboth Mitanni and Van the syllabary was on the high-road to becoming an\r\nalphabet; in Persia it actually became one.\r\n\r\nBut this final evolution came too late. A simpler script had already\r\nentered the field, and won its way in lands where clay was scarce\r\nand other writing materials more easily procurable. Indeed, it is\r\nprobable that the presence or absence of clay suitable for writing\r\npurposes had quite as much to do with the spread of the cuneiform\r\nscript as the political events which transformed the map of Western\r\nAsia. Canaan still continued to write in cuneiform characters after the\r\nempire of Babylonia had been exchanged for that of Egypt, while the\r\nuse of the script never penetrated far into the limestone regions of\r\nthe Mediterranean. It was probably the geological formation of Europe\r\nmore than anything else which saved us to-day from having to learn the\r\nlatest modification of the cursive writing of the Babylonian plain.\r\n\r\nBut it had been a potent instrument of civilization in its day, perhaps\r\nmore potent even than the Phœnician alphabet, for its sway lasted\r\nfor thousands of years. It was at once the symbol and the inspiring\r\nspirit of a culture whose roots go back to the very beginnings of\r\nhuman civilization, and to which we still owe part of our own heritage\r\nof civilized life. Babylonia was the mother-land of astronomy and\r\nirrigation; from thence a knowledge of copper seems to have spread\r\nthrough Western Asia; it was there that the laws and regulations of\r\ntrade were first formulated, and the earliest legal code, so far as\r\nwe know, was compiled. Babylonian theology and cosmology left their\r\nimpress upon beliefs and views of the world which have passed through\r\nJudæa to Europe, and the astrology and magic which played so active\r\na part in the mental history of the Middle Ages were Babylonian\r\ncreations. It is not a little remarkable that an Etruscan model of the\r\nliver in bronze (discovered at Piacenza), divided and inscribed for\r\nthe purposes of haruspicy, finds its counterpart and probably also its\r\nprototype in the clay copy of a liver, similarly divided and inscribed,\r\nwhich was found in Babylonia.[155] We are children of our fathers, and\r\namongst our spiritual fathers must be reckoned the Babylonians.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                              CHAPTER VII\r\n\r\n                CANAAN IN THE CENTURY BEFORE THE EXODUS\r\n\r\n\r\nIt is now nearly twenty years ago since the archæological world was\r\nstartled, not to say revolutionized, by the discovery of the cuneiform\r\ntablets of Tel el-Amarna in Upper Egypt. Nor was it the archæological\r\nworld only which the discovery affected. The historian and the\r\ntheologian have equally had to modify and forsake their old ideas\r\nand assumptions, and the criticism of the Old Testament writings has\r\nentered upon a new and altogether unexpected stage. The archæologist,\r\nthe historian and the Biblical critic alike can never again return to\r\nthe point of view which was dominant before 1887, or regard the ancient\r\nworld of the East with the unbelieving eyes of a Grote or a Cornewall\r\nLewis. A single archæological discovery has upset mountains of learned\r\ndiscussion, of ingenious theory and sceptical demonstration.\r\n\r\nAt the risk of repeating a well-worn tale, I will describe briefly\r\nthe nature of the discovery. In the ruins of a city and palace which,\r\nlike the palace of Aladdin, rose out of the desert sands into gorgeous\r\nmagnificence for a short thirty years and then perished utterly, some\r\n300 clay tablets were found, inscribed, not with the hieroglyphics\r\nof Egypt, but with the cuneiform characters of Babylonia. They were,\r\nin fact, the contents of the Foreign Office of Amon-hotep IV., the\r\n“Heretic King” of Egyptian history, who endeavoured to reform the old\r\nreligion of Egypt and to substitute for it a pantheistic monotheism.\r\nThis was about 1400 years before the birth of Christ, and a full\r\ncentury before the Israelitish Exodus. The attempt failed in spite of\r\nthe fanatical efforts of its royal patron to force it upon his people,\r\nand of his introduction of religious persecution for the first time\r\ninto the world. The Eighteenth dynasty, to which he belonged, and which\r\nhad conquered Western Asia, went down in civil and religious war; the\r\nAsiatic Empire of Egypt was lost, and a new dynasty sat on the throne\r\nof Thebes.\r\n\r\nThe archives in the Foreign Office included not only the foreign\r\ncorrespondence of Amon-hotep’s own reign, but the foreign\r\ncorrespondence also of his father, which he had carried with him from\r\nThebes when he founded his new capital at Tel el-Amarna. And the scope\r\nand character of it are astounding. There are letters from the kings\r\nof Babylonia and Assyria, of Mesopotamia and the Hittites, of Cilicia\r\nand Cappadocia, besides letters and communications of all sorts from\r\nthe Egyptian governors and vassal princes in Canaan and Syria. Most of\r\nthe correspondence is in the language of Babylonia; it is only in a few\r\nrare instances that the cuneiform characters embody the actual language\r\nof the people from whom the letters were sent. It is difficult to\r\nimagine anything more subversive of the ideas about the ancient history\r\nof the East, which were current twenty years ago, than the conclusions\r\nto be drawn from this correspondence. It proved that, so far as\r\nliterary culture is concerned, the civilized Oriental world in the\r\nMosaic age was quite as civilized as our own. There were schools and\r\nlibraries all over it, in which a foreign language and a complicated\r\nforeign system of writing formed an essential part of education. It\r\nproved that this education was widely spread: there are letters from\r\nBedâwîn shêkhs as well as from a lady who was much interested in\r\npolitics. It showed that this correspondence was active and regular,\r\nthat those who took part in it wrote to each other on the trivial\r\ntopics of the day, and that the high-roads and postal service were\r\nalike well organized. We learned that the nations of the Orient were no\r\nisolated units cut off from one another except when one of them made\r\nwar with the other, but that, on the contrary, their mutual relations\r\nwere as close and intimate as those of modern Europe. The Babylonian\r\nking in his distant capital on the Euphrates sent to condole with the\r\nEgyptian Pharaoh on his father’s death like a modern potentate, and was\r\nevery whit as anxious to protect and encourage the trade of his country\r\nas Mr. Chamberlain. Indeed, the privileges of the merchant and the\r\nsacredness of his person had long been a matter of international law.\r\n\r\nIn one respect the advocates of international harmony and arbitration\r\nwere better off in the Mosaic age than they are in the Europe of\r\nto-day. There was no difficulty about diversities of language and the\r\ndanger of being misunderstood. The language of diplomacy, of education\r\nand trade was everywhere the same, and was understood, read and written\r\nby all educated persons. Even the Egyptian lord of Western Asia had to\r\nswallow his pride and write in the language and script of Babylonia\r\nwhen he corresponded with his own subjects in Canaan. Indeed, like\r\nEnglish officials in Egypt, who are supposed to write to one another on\r\nofficial business in French, his own Egyptian envoys and commissioners\r\nsent their official communications in the foreign tongue. The Oriental\r\nworld in the century before the Exodus thus anticipated the Roman\r\nEmpire.\r\n\r\nCanaan was the centre and focus of the correspondence. It was the\r\nbattle-ground and meeting-place of the great powers of the Eastern\r\nworld. It had long been a province of Babylonia, and, like the rest\r\nof the Babylonian Empire, subject to Babylonian law and permeated\r\nby Babylonian literary culture. It was during these centuries of\r\nBabylonian government that it had come to adopt as its own the script\r\nand language of its rulers; the deities of Babylonia were worshipped\r\non the high places of Palestine, and Babylonian legends and traditions\r\nwere taught in its schools.\r\n\r\nOut of Canaan had marched the Hyksos who conquered Egypt. The names\r\nof their kings found on the monuments that have survived to us are\r\ndistinctively Canaanite of the patriarchal period; among them is\r\nJacob-el, or Jacob, whom the Alexandrine Jews seem to have identified\r\nwith their own ancestor. While the Hyksos Pharaohs reigned, Egypt\r\nwas but a dependency of Canaan; the source of Hyksos power lay in\r\nCanaan, and their Egyptian capital was accordingly placed close to the\r\nCanaanitish frontier.\r\n\r\nWhen, after five generations of warfare, the native princes of Thebes\r\nsucceeded at last in expelling the Hyksos conquerors from the valley\r\nof the Nile and in founding the Eighteenth dynasty, they perceived\r\nthat their best hope of preventing a second Asiatic conquest lay in\r\npossessing themselves of the land which was, as it were, the key to\r\ntheir own. The Hyksos conquest, in fact, had shown that Canaan was at\r\nonce a link between Asia and Africa, and the open gate which let the\r\ninvader into the fertile fields of Egypt. The war, therefore, that had\r\nended by driving the Asiatic out of Egypt was now carried into his own\r\nhome. Campaign after campaign finally crushed Canaanitish resistance,\r\nand the Egyptian standards were planted on the banks of the Euphrates.\r\nPalestine and Syria were transformed into Egyptian provinces; in the\r\nlanguage of the tenth chapter of Genesis, they became the brothers of\r\nMizraim.\r\n\r\nThe Tel el-Amarna letters tell us how the new provinces were organized.\r\nThe most important cities were placed under Egyptian governors, many\r\nof whom, however, were natives. But they were carefully watched by\r\nEgyptian commissioners, to whom the control of the military forces was\r\nentrusted, as well as by special high-commissioners sent from time\r\nto time by the imperial Government. Local jealousies and rivalries,\r\nmoreover, among the governors prevented union among them against the\r\ncentral power, and up to a certain point were not discouraged by the\r\nEgyptian Foreign Office. The Tel el-Amarna letters offer us a curious\r\npicture of the extent to which their mutual animosities were carried in\r\nthe days when the Egyptian Empire was growing feeble. All the governors\r\nprotest their devotion to the court, and all like are accused by their\r\nrivals of intriguing and even fighting against it.\r\n\r\nBesides the states which were thus directly under Egyptian rule, there\r\nwere also protected states. Here the representative of the old line\r\nof kings was allowed to retain a titular authority, though in reality\r\nhis power was not greater than that of the governors in other states.\r\nBut, whether governor or protected prince his duty to the imperial\r\nGovernment was clearly marked out for him. He had to levy the taxes and\r\nsend a fixed amount of tribute to the Egyptian Treasury, to provide a\r\ncertain number of militia, and to send official reports to the king. He\r\nhad further to see that the troops of the army of occupation were duly\r\nprovided with pay and maintenance.\r\n\r\nThe army of occupation in the reign of Amon-hotep IV. does not seem to\r\nhave been large. The imperial forces were needed at home to enforce\r\nthe new faith upon the Egyptian people, and to put down the discontent\r\nthat was growing there. We hear, however, of “the household troops,”\r\nwho belonged to the standing army of Egypt and formed the nucleus of\r\nthe permanent garrison. How many of them were native Egyptians it is\r\nimpossible to say; as we hear of Kushites or Ethiopians among them,\r\nit is probable that the Sudanese were at least as largely employed on\r\nforeign service as the Egyptians themselves. The Egyptian has never\r\nbeen fond of military service, whereas, we all now know, the Sudanese\r\nis essentially a fighting animal.\r\n\r\nBoth sides of the Jordan were included in the Egyptian administration.\r\nOne of the Tel el-Amarna letters, for example, is from a governor of\r\n“the field of Bashan.” It is characteristic of the whole series, and\r\nshows what the relations were between the army of occupation and the\r\nnative levies. I cannot do better than quote it in full: “To the king,\r\nmy lord, thus says Artamanya, the governor of the Field of Bashan, thy\r\nservant: at the feet of the king, my lord, seven times seven do I fall.\r\nBehold, thou hast written to me to join the household troops, and how\r\ncould I be a dog (of the king) and not go? Behold, I and my soldiers\r\nand my chariots will join the household troops in whatever place the\r\nking my lord orders.”\r\n\r\nThe name of Artamanya is not Semitic; neither is it Egyptian. The fact\r\nbrings us to one of the most interesting and unexpected results of the\r\ndecipherment of the Tel el-Amarna correspondence. And this is that the\r\nruling caste in the Palestine of the Mosaic age was largely of Hittite\r\norigin, or had come from those countries of the north whose population\r\nwas related in blood and language to the Hittites of Asia Minor.\r\n\r\nIn Northern Mesopotamia was a kingdom which ranked with those of Egypt\r\nand Babylonia as regarded power and influence. Its native name was\r\nMitanni; the Hebrews, like the Egyptians, called it the kingdom of\r\nAram Naharaim. It stretched from Assyria to the Orontes, and contended\r\nwith the Hittites of Carchemish for the possession of the fords of\r\nthe Euphrates. Its rulers had descended upon it from the highlands of\r\nArmenia and the Caucasus, and had reduced the native Aramæan population\r\nto servitude. There are frequent references in the Tel el-Amarna\r\ntablets to Mitannian intrigues in Canaan. Mitannian armies had from\r\ntime to time marched against the Canaanitish cities, and although there\r\nwas now a nominal alliance between Mitanni and Egypt, and the royal\r\nfamilies of the two countries were united by marriage, the Mitannian\r\ncourt never lost an opportunity of sending secret support to the\r\ndisaffected princes of Canaan or of encouraging them in their revolts\r\nfrom the Egyptian Government. In many parts of the country the ruling\r\nfamily continued to be Mitannian, and accordingly we find more than one\r\ngovernor who bears a Mitannian name. Thus one of them, as we see, was\r\ngovernor of Bashan, and there was another who had his seat near the Sea\r\nof Galilee.\r\n\r\nMitannian influence, however, was chiefly confined to the northern part\r\nof Palestine. It was otherwise with the Hittites, whose marauding bands\r\npenetrated as far south as the frontiers of Egypt. The important part\r\nthey played in the early history of Canaan and the substantial element\r\nthey must have contributed to the future population of the country has\r\nbut lately been disclosed to us by the advance that has been made in\r\nthe interpretation of the Tel el-Amarna texts. We have at last obtained\r\nan explanation of the fact that whereas in the older Babylonian period\r\nCanaan was known as “the land of the Amorites,” it was called by the\r\nAssyrians “the land of the Hittites.” The Assyrian kings even speak\r\nof Judah and Moab as “Hittite,” and the town of Ashdod is described\r\nby Sargon as a “Hittite” state. What this must mean has indeed long\r\nbeen recognized by the Assyriologists. When the Assyrians first became\r\nacquainted with Palestine the Hittites must have been there the\r\ndominant power. But how and when this came about we have but just begun\r\nto learn, and it is the story of the Hittite occupation of Canaan, as a\r\nbetter knowledge of the Tel el-Amarna tablets is making possible, that\r\nI now propose to describe.\r\n\r\nThe Hittite race was of Cappadocian origin. Professor Ramsay has\r\npointed out that the hieroglyphic characters which they used in\r\ntheir inscriptions must have been invented on the treeless plateau\r\nof Central Asia Minor, and that their capital, whose ruins now strew\r\nthe ground at Boghaz Keui, north of the Halys, was the centre towards\r\nwhich all the early high-roads of Asia Minor converge. But they\r\nextended on both sides of the Taurus Mountains, and at an early date\r\nhad planted themselves in Northern Syria. I have lately succeeded in\r\ndeciphering their inscriptions, which have so long baffled our attempts\r\nto read them, and one result of my decipherment is the discovery of\r\nan unexpected fact. I find that the name of Hittite was confined to\r\nthat portion of the race which lived eastward and southward of the\r\nTaurus. In Asia Minor itself, their first cradle and home, they called\r\nthemselves Kas or Kasians; it was the kingdom of Kas over which the\r\nHittite lords of Boghaz Keui claimed to rule, and it is still as kings\r\nof Kas that they are entitled on the monuments of Carchemish, though\r\nhere they also acknowledge the name of Hittite.\r\n\r\nThe name of Kas is met with in the Tel el-Amarna tablets, where it has\r\nhitherto been misunderstood. The kings of the Hittites, of Mitanni\r\nand of Kas are associated together as supporting the enemies of the\r\nEgyptian Pharaoh or attacking his cities in Syria, Hitherto we have\r\nsupposed that Kas signified Babylonia, though the supposition had but\r\nlittle in its favour, and a different name is given to Babylonia in\r\npassages where there is no doubt as to what country is meant. Now,\r\nhowever, all becomes clear: in the age of the tablets there were still\r\nfour Hittite kingdoms in the north: Kas in Asia Minor, the Hittites\r\nproper, east and south of the Taurus, Mitanni in Mesopotamia, and\r\nNaharaim on the Orontes. Shortly afterwards they were all swallowed\r\nup in the empire of the “great king” of the Hittites, whose southern\r\ncapital was at Kadesh. Some Kasians had found their way to Jerusalem,\r\nwhere the king Ebed-Kheba--whose name is compounded with that of a\r\nMitannian deity--writes to the Egyptian Government to excuse his\r\nconduct in regard to them. They had been accused of plundering the\r\nPharaoh’s territory and murdering his servants; he assures the court\r\nthat nothing of the sort is true. They are still in his house, where\r\nit would seem they formed his bodyguard. But, on the other hand,\r\nthere were other Hittites in the neighbourhood of Jerusalem who were\r\nreally enemies to the king and threatened Jerusalem itself. These he\r\ncalls Khabiri, or “Confederates,” a name in which, despite history and\r\nprobability, certain writers have insisted upon seeing the Hebrews\r\nof the Old Testament. But Dr. Knudtzon’s fresh collation of the\r\nTel el-Amarna texts has at last dispelled the mystery. The Khabiri\r\nturn out to have been bands of Hittite condottieri, who sold their\r\nmilitary services to the highest bidder and carved out principalities\r\nfor themselves in the south of Canaan. The Egyptian Government found\r\nthem useful in escorting and protecting the trading caravans to Asia\r\nMinor and the Taurus region, and as long as their leaders professed\r\nthemselves the devoted servants of the Pharaoh it was quite willing\r\nto overlook such little accidents as their capture and sack of a\r\nCanaanitish town or the murder of a Canaanitish prince.\r\n\r\nOne of these Hittite leaders, Aita-gama by name, had possessed himself\r\nof the city of Kadesh on the Orontes, which in the following century\r\nwas to become the capital of a Hittite empire. In a letter to the\r\nEgyptian court he has the audacity to assert that he was merely\r\nclaiming his patrimony, the whole district having belonged to his\r\nfather. If there is any truth in this it can only mean that his father\r\nhad already led a troop of Hittite raiders into this portion of the\r\nEgyptian territory.\r\n\r\nAlong with Aita-gama two other Hittite chieftains had marched,\r\nTeuwatti, whose name appears in the native texts under the form of\r\nTuates, and Arzawaya. Arzawaya means “a man of Arzawa,” the country\r\nwhose language has been revealed to us in one of the Tel el-Amarna\r\nletters, and which proves to be the same as the Hittite dialect\r\nfound in the cuneiform tablets of Boghaz Keui. We are told that he\r\ncame from a city which was in the neighbourhood of the Karmalas, in\r\nSouthern Cappadocia. Arzawaya helped Teuwatti to conquer Damascus and\r\nthen led his followers further south. Here he acted as a free-lance,\r\nhiring himself and his mercenaries to the rival Canaanitish princes\r\nand professing himself to be all the while a faithful servant of the\r\nEgyptian king. It is amusing to read one of his letters to the Egyptian\r\ncourt: “To my lord the king thus writes Arzawaya, of Rukhiza. At the\r\nfeet of my lord I prostrate myself. My lord the king wrote that I\r\nshould join the household troops of the king my lord and his numerous\r\nofficers.” Here follow four words of Hittite which are accompanied by\r\nthe translation: “I am a servant of the king my lord.” Then the letter\r\nproceeds: “I will join the household troops of the king my lord and\r\nhis officers; and I will send everything after them and march wherever\r\nthere is rebellion against the king my lord. And we will deliver\r\nhis enemies into the hand of the king our lord.” Doubtless Arzawaya\r\nexpected to be well paid for his help.\r\n\r\nThere is another letter from Arzawaya to the Pharaoh in which he calls\r\nhimself “the dust of his feet and the ground on which he treads.” But\r\nin this letter he has to explain away the share he took in entering\r\nthe town of Gezer along with Labbawa,[156] another Hittite leader,\r\nand there infringing the royal prerogative by summoning a levy of\r\nthe militia. In the eyes of the home Government this was a much\r\nmore serious matter than merely plundering or killing a few of its\r\nCanaanitish subjects, as it was equivalent to usurping the functions of\r\nthe imperial power.\r\n\r\nLabbawa also had to write and ask for forgiveness, and assure the\r\nPharaoh that he is his “devoted slave,” who does “not withhold his\r\ntribute” or disobey the “requests” of the Egyptian commissioners. In\r\nfact, he concludes his letter with declaring that “if the king should\r\nwrite to me: Run a sword of bronze into your heart and die, I would\r\nnot fail to execute the king’s command.” All the same, however, he had\r\nestablished himself securely on Mount Shechem, from whence, like Joshua\r\nin after days, he was able to make raids on the surrounding Canaanitish\r\ntowns. In the north we hear of him at Shunem and Gath-Rimmon, where\r\nhe first appeared upon the scene in the train of the Egyptian army at\r\na time when Amon-hotep III. was suppressing an insurrection in that\r\npart of Palestine. It is probable that he had just arrived with his\r\nband of condottieri, attracted by the pay and the chance of plunder\r\nthat the Egyptian Pharaoh offered the free-lance. By a curious fatality\r\nit was also in this same locality that he afterwards met his death at\r\nthe hands of the people of Gina--the Cana of Galilee, probably, of St.\r\nJohn’s Gospel.\r\n\r\nLabbawa cast envious eyes on the important city of Megiddo, and its\r\ngovernor--who, by the way, is mentioned in one of the cuneiform\r\ntablets found three years ago by the Austrian excavators on the\r\nsite of Taanach--sent piteous appeals for assistance against him to\r\nthe Egyptian Government. The beleaguered governor declared that so\r\nclosely invested was he by the Hittite free-lances that he could not\r\nventure outside the gates of his town. The peasantry were afraid even\r\nto bring vegetables into it, and unless help were forthcoming from\r\nEgypt, Megiddo was doomed. After all, however, Labbawa was not only\r\nunable to possess himself of the Canaanitish stronghold, but was taken\r\nprisoner and confined in the very place he had hoped to capture. But\r\nfortune befriended him. He managed to bribe the governor of Acre, and\r\nthe latter, on the pretext that he was going to send Labbawa by sea to\r\nEgypt, took him out of prison and set him free.\r\n\r\nLabbawa now turned his attention to the south of Palestine--the future\r\nterritory of Judah. Here he entered into alliance with the king of\r\nJerusalem, or, to speak more precisely, was taken into his pay, and\r\nthe two together waged war on the neighbouring states. One of the\r\nEgyptian governors complains that they had robbed him of Keilah, and he\r\nhad to wait for Labbawa’s death before he could recover his city.\r\n\r\nOne of the two letters in the Tel el-Amarna collection which are in\r\nthe Arzawan or Hittite language was written by Labbawa, as we have\r\nlately learned from Dr. Knudtzon’s revised copy of it. In this he calls\r\nhimself a native of the Hittite district of Uan, near Aleppo, and\r\nrefers to “the Hittite king,” though our knowledge of the language is\r\ntoo imperfect to allow us to understand the meaning of the reference.\r\nThe letter is addressed simply “to my lord,” and we do not know,\r\ntherefore, whether it was intended for Hittite or Egyptian eyes. After\r\nhis settlement in Palestine, however, Labbawa adopted the official\r\nlanguage of the country; his letters to the Pharaoh are in Babylonian,\r\nand his son bore the characteristically Semitic name of Mut-Baal. The\r\nfact is an interesting example of the rapid way in which the Hittite\r\nsettlers in Palestine were Semitized. They brought no women with them,\r\nand their wives accordingly were natives of Canaan.\r\n\r\nLabbawa left two sons behind him, who, in spite of their Semitic\r\neducation, followed in their father’s footsteps and continued to\r\nlead his company of Hittite mercenaries. Mut-Baal, moreover, made\r\nhimself useful to the Government by escorting the trading caravans to\r\nCappadocia, a fact which proves that he still maintained relations\r\nwith the country of his origin. The alliance between Ebed-Kheba of\r\nJerusalem and his father, however, had come to an end; Ebed-Kheba now\r\nhad the Hittites of Kas in his pay, and no longer needed the services\r\nof the sons of Labbawa. They therefore transferred themselves to\r\nhis rivals, together with the sons of Arzawaya, who, like Labbawa,\r\nwas now dead, and Ebed-Kheba soon found himself in difficulties.\r\nThe result was letter after letter from him to the Egyptian court,\r\nbegging for help against his enemies, and declaring that if no help\r\ncame the king’s territory would be lost. These appeals seem to have\r\nmet with no response; the Egyptian Government was by no means assured\r\nof Ebed-Kheba’s loyalty, and knew that if the territory of Jerusalem\r\nwere to pass into the hands of the Hittite chieftain it would make but\r\nlittle difference to the imperial power. The tribute would still be\r\npaid, the Egyptian commissioner would still be respected, and the new\r\nrulers of the district would profess themselves the faithful subjects\r\nof the Pharaoh. There would merely be a change of governors, and\r\nnothing more. The Hittite mercenaries were formidable only in the petty\r\nstruggles which took place between the rival Canaanitish governors;\r\nwhen it came to dealing with the regular army of Egypt they were\r\nnumerically too few to be of account.\r\n\r\nEbed-Kheba calls the followers of Labbawa and Arzawaya “Khabiri.”\r\nI have long ago pointed out that the word is found elsewhere in\r\nthe Assyrian texts in the sense of “Confederates,” and that its\r\nidentification with the Hebrews of the Old Testament, though\r\nphonetically possible, is historically impossible. Now that we know the\r\nnationality of Labbawa and Arzawaya the question is finally settled,\r\nand we can explain a hitherto puzzling passage in one of Ebed-Kheba’s\r\nletters, in which he says that “when ships were on the sea the arm\r\nof the mighty king seized Naharaim and Kas, but now the Khabiri have\r\nseized the cities of the king.” Naharaim lay southward of the gulf of\r\nAntioch, while Kas extended to the Cilician coast, and they were thus,\r\nboth of them, within reach of a maritime Power; they were, moreover,\r\nboth of them Hittite regions, Naharaim being the district afterwards\r\ncalled Khattinâ, “the Hittite land,” by the Assyrians, while Kas was\r\nthe Hittite kingdom of Cappadocia. Ebed-Kheba, therefore, is drawing\r\na comparison between the power of “the mighty king” in the days when\r\nan Egyptian fleet controlled the sea and the present time when Hittite\r\nmarauders are seizing without let or hindrance the king’s cities on the\r\nvery borders of Egypt. Even Lachish and Ashkelon had joined the enemy.\r\n\r\nPerhaps the most important of the King of Jerusalem’s letters is one\r\nwhich has hitherto been misunderstood, partly owing to its being broken\r\nin half and the relation of the two halves to one another not being\r\nrecognized, partly to the imperfections of the published copy. Now\r\nthat a complete and accurate text of it lies before us, its meaning\r\nhas ceased to be a riddle, and I will therefore give here the first\r\ntranslation that has been made of the completed text--\r\n\r\n“To the king my lord thus says Ebed-Kheba thy servant: at the feet\r\nof my lord the king seven times seven I prostrate myself. Behold,\r\nMalchiel has not separated himself from the sons of Labbawa and the\r\nsons of Arzawaya so as to claim the king’s land for them. A governor\r\nwho commits such an act, why has not the king questioned him (about\r\nit)? Behold, Malchiel and Tagi have committed such an act by seizing\r\nthe city of Rabbah. And now as to Jerusalem, if this land belongs to\r\nthe king, why is it that Gaza has been appointed for the (residence of\r\nthe) king (’s commissioner)? Behold the land of Gath-Carmel is in the\r\npower of Tagi, and the men of Gath are (his) bodyguard. He is (now) in\r\nBeth-Sannah. But (nevertheless) we will act. Malchiel wrote to Tagi\r\nthat they should give Labbawa and Mount Shechem to the district of\r\nthe Khabiri, and he took some boys as slaves. They granted all their\r\ndemands to the people of Keilah. But we will rescue Jerusalem. The\r\ngarrison which you sent by Khaya the son of Meri-Ra has been taken\r\nby Hadad-mikhir and stationed in his house at Gaza. [I have sent\r\nmessengers] to Egypt, [and may] the king [listen to me].... There is\r\nno garrison of the king [here]. Verily by the life of the king Pa-ur\r\nhas gone down to Egypt; he has left me and is in Gaza. But let the king\r\nentrust to him a garrison for the defence of the land. All the land of\r\nthe king has revolted. Send Yenkhamu and let him take charge of the\r\nking’s land.\r\n\r\n“(Postscript): To the secretary of the king says Ebed-Kheba your\r\nservant: [bring] what I say clearly before the king. Kindest regards to\r\nyou! I am your servant.”\r\n\r\nThe references in this letter are explained in other letters from the\r\nsame correspondent. Malchiel was the native governor of the Hebron\r\ndistrict, and had married the daughter of Tagi, whose name does not\r\nsound Semitic. The Hittite mercenaries of Labbawa from Shechem and\r\nof Arzawaya, who does not seem to have established himself in any\r\nspecial district of the country, were now in the pay of Malchiel,\r\nwhile Ebed-Kheba, as we have seen, had secured the services of another\r\nbody of Hittites from Kas. He had been accused at the Egyptian court\r\nof seeking by their means to make himself independent, and more than\r\none of his letters is occupied with defending himself and bringing a\r\ncounter-charge against Malchiel. Malchiel, however, secured the support\r\nof the royal commissioner, Yenkhamu, who agreed to his employment\r\nof the Hittite condottieri. With their assistance Keilah had been\r\nrecovered from the hands of Ebed-Kheba, who, at an earlier date,\r\nhad got Labbawa to seize it for him, but after Labbawa’s death the\r\ntables were turned, and his sons had offered their services to the\r\nrival party, doubtless for the sake of better pay. It was now that\r\nMalchiel summoned the militia of Gezer, Gath-Carmel and Keilah, and\r\nmade himself master of Rabbah, a small place north-west of Keilah and\r\nHebron, which Ebed-Kheba asserted belonged to _his_ territory.\r\nThe tide was beginning to turn against the King of Jerusalem: his\r\nenemies were in greater favour at court than he was himself, and they\r\nhad the support of the Hittite bands. It was in vain that he appealed\r\nto the Egyptian Government for aid and declared that not only had his\r\nrivals given Mount Shechem to the Hittite free-lances, but that by\r\ntheir action against himself they were delivering the whole of Southern\r\nPalestine into Hittite hands. “The king,” he writes, “no longer has\r\nany territory, the Khabiri have wasted all the lands of the king. If\r\nthe royal troops come this year, the country will remain my lord the\r\nking’s, but if no troops come, the territory of the king my lord is\r\nlost.”\r\n\r\nAt this point the story breaks off abruptly. The Tel el-Amarna\r\ncorrespondence comes to an end and the fate of Jerusalem and the\r\nsurrounding districts is unknown to us. Soon afterwards religious\r\ntroubles at home forced the Egyptian Government to withdraw its troops\r\nfrom Canaan altogether, and for awhile the Egyptian empire in Asia\r\nceased to exist. It was restored, however, by Seti I. and his son,\r\nRamses II, at the beginning of the Nineteenth dynasty, and among the\r\ncities whose conquest is celebrated by Ramses on the walls of the\r\nRamesseum at Thebes is Shalem or Jerusalem. But this second Egyptian\r\nempire in Asia did not last long, and when the Israelitish Exodus\r\ntook place it was already passing away. When some years later the\r\nIsraelitish invaders planted themselves in Labbawa’s old stronghold\r\non Mount Shechem, the Egyptian occupation of Canaan belonged to the\r\nhistory of the past.\r\n\r\nLike the Saxons in England, however, the Hittite chieftains must have\r\nfounded principalities for themselves in the south of Canaan, as we\r\nknow from the evidence of the Tel el-Amarna tablets and the Egyptian\r\nmonuments that they did in the north. Ezekiel, in fact, tells us that\r\nthe mother of Jerusalem was a Hittite, and the Jebusites, from whom\r\nJerusalem took its name in the age of the Israelitish conquest, were\r\nprobably the descendants of the followers of the Hittite Arzawaya.\r\nThey had, moreover, found a Hittite population already settled in\r\nthe country, descendants of older bands who had made their way from\r\nthe highlands of Asia Minor to the frontiers of Egypt in days when\r\nas yet Abraham was unborn. At the very commencement of the Egyptian\r\ntwelfth dynasty we hear of the Pharaohs destroying “the palaces of the\r\nHittites” in Southern Palestine,[157] and archæology has recently shown\r\nthat the painted pottery discovered in the earlier strata of Lachish\r\nand Gezer by English excavators had its original home in Northern\r\nCappadocia and is an enduring evidence of Hittite culture and trade.\r\n\r\nThe Hittites had been preceded in their occupation of Canaan by the\r\nAmorites, as we have learnt from the Babylonian inscriptions. But in\r\nthe Tel el-Amarna age the specifically Amoritish territory was in the\r\nnorth, eastward of Tyre and Gebal. Here Ebed-Asherah and his son Aziru\r\nhad their seat and from hence they led their forces northwards towards\r\nAleppo to resist “the king of the Hittites” on behalf of the Egyptian\r\nGovernment, or attacked the Phœnician cities on their own account.\r\nIn the north, in fact, they played much the same part as the Hittite\r\nmercenaries did in the south, with the additional advantage of being\r\nable to secure secret assistance when it was needed from Mitanni.\r\nBetween Amorites and Hittites the Canaanites must have had a somewhat\r\nunhappy time, like the Britons after the departure of the Roman\r\nlegions, who found themselves the alternate prey of Saxons and Scots.\r\nBut we can now understand and appreciate the ethnological notice in the\r\nBook of Numbers (xiii. 29), which tells us that “the Hittites and the\r\nJebusites and the Amorites dwell in the mountains, and the Canaanites\r\ndwell by the sea and by the coast of Jordan.”\r\n\r\nThe Amorite princes, however, were more formidable to the Egyptian\r\nGovernment than the Hittite chieftains, or else must have played their\r\ncards a little too openly, for we find Aziru receiving a scolding such\r\nas the Egyptian court seldom had the courage or energy to give. The\r\nletter from the Egyptian Foreign Office, which is a long one, is worth\r\ntranslating in full--\r\n\r\n“To the governor of the land of the Amorites [thus] says the king your\r\nlord. The governor of Gebal, thy brother, whom his brother has driven\r\nfrom the gate (of the city) has said: ‘Take me and bring me back into\r\nmy city, [and] I will then give you money, [for] I have nothing [of\r\nvalue] with me now.’ So he spoke to you.\r\n\r\n“Behold, you write to the king your lord saying: I am your servant like\r\nall the loyal governors who are each in his city. Yet you have acted\r\nwrongly in taking a governor whom his brother had driven from the gate\r\nof his city, and being in Sidon you handed him over to the governors\r\n(there) at your own discretion, as if you did not know that they were\r\nrebellious.\r\n\r\n“If you are really a servant of the king why have you not seen that he\r\nshould go up to the presence of the king your lord instead of thinking,\r\n‘This governor wrote to me saying, “Take me to thyself and restore me\r\nto my city”’?\r\n\r\n“But if you have acted loyally and nothing that I write is correct, the\r\nking has devised a lie in saying that nothing which you declare is true.\r\n\r\n“But it happens that one has heard that you have made a treaty with the\r\n(Hittite) prince of Kadesh to deliver food and drink to one another,\r\nand it is true. Why have you acted thus? Why have you made a treaty\r\nwith a governor with whom another governor is at enmity? For if you act\r\nwith loyalty to him and observe your and his engagements you cannot\r\nlook after (our) interests as you have undertaken to do long ago.\r\nWhatever be your conduct in the matter you are not on the side of the\r\nking your lord.\r\n\r\n“Now as for these men to whom you want to turn, they are seeking to\r\nget you into the fire and to burn (you) and all you most love. Whereas\r\nif you submit yourself to the king your lord, what is there which the\r\nking cannot do for you? If in anything you love to act wickedly and if\r\nyou lay up wickedness, even thoughts of rebellion, in your heart, then\r\nyou will die by the axe of the king along with all your family. Submit\r\ntherefore to the king your lord, and you shall live, for you know that\r\nthe king has no wish to be angry with all the land of Canaan.\r\n\r\n“And since you write: ‘Let the king excuse me this year and I will go\r\nnext year to the court of the king my lord, my son not being with me,’\r\nthe king your lord accordingly will excuse you this year as you have\r\nasked. Go yourself instead of sending your son, and you shall see the\r\nking in the sight of whom all the world lives, and do not say: let me\r\nbe excused this year also from going to the court of the king your\r\nlord; and do not send your son to the king your lord; he must not go in\r\nyour place.\r\n\r\n“And now the king your lord has heard that you wrote to the king\r\nsaying, ‘Let the king my lord permit Khanni the messenger of the king\r\nto come to me for the second time, and I will deliver the enemies of\r\nthe king into his hand.’ Now he will go to you as you have asked; do\r\nyou therefore deliver them (to him) and do not let a single one of\r\nthem escape. Now the king your lord sends you the names of the king’s\r\nenemies in this letter by the hand of Khanni the king’s messenger; so\r\ndeliver them to the king your lord and let not a single one of them\r\nescape, but put fetters of bronze upon their feet. Behold, the men you\r\nare to send to the king your lord are Sarru with all his sons, Tuia,\r\nLiya with all his sons, Yisyari with all his sons, (and) the son-in-law\r\nof Manya with his sons and wives. The treasurer of Khanni is the\r\nofficial who will read the dispatch. Dâsirtî, Pâlûwa and Nimmakhî have\r\ngone [to collect taxes?] into the country of the Amorites.\r\n\r\n“And know that the king, the Sun-god in heaven, is well; his soldiers\r\nand chariots are many; from the upper country to the lower country,\r\nfrom the rising of the sun [to] the setting of the sun all is peace.”\r\n\r\nWe hear again of one of the rebels mentioned in this letter in the\r\ntablet discovered at Lachish in Palestine by Mr. Bliss. Yisyari is\r\nthere described as inciting the governor of Lachish to revolt and\r\npromising assistance if he would call out the militia of his city\r\nagainst the king. That an Amorite of the north should thus have been\r\nable to interfere in the politics of a city in the south of Palestine\r\nis an interesting illustration of what I may call the solidarity of\r\nSyria and Canaan in the pre-Mosaic period. They had not yet been broken\r\nup into a series of isolated States; like the Hittites, the Amorites\r\nstill claimed to be a power in the future territory of Judah as well as\r\nin the neighbourhood of Sidon or Hamath.\r\n\r\nIt is possible that a well-known but somewhat mysterious personage\r\nof the Old Testament was one of the Hittite leaders who succeeded\r\nin carving out a principality for himself: I mean Balaam the son of\r\nBeor. He is said to have come from the Hittite town of Pethor near\r\nCarchemish, and besides being a seer and a prophet he was also a\r\nsoldier who fell in the ranks of the Midianites in a war against\r\nIsrael. But Balaam the son of Beor was not only a native of Pethor;\r\nwe hear of him again in the Book of Genesis, and here he appears as\r\nthe first king of Edom, his name heading the list of Edomite kings\r\nextracted from the state annals of Edom and probably brought to\r\nJerusalem when David conquered the country. In the light of what\r\nwe have learnt from the tablets of Tel el-Amarna it is perhaps not\r\ngoing too far to suppose that in Balaam we have one of those Hittite\r\nchieftains who, after playing the part of prophet, made himself leader\r\nof a band of Hittite free-lances and established a kingdom for himself\r\nin Edom, finally falling in battle by the side of his Midianite allies.\r\n\r\nHowever this may be, the important place occupied by the Hittites in\r\ncreating the Canaan which the Israelites invaded is now clear. While\r\nthe larger bands of Hittite raiders settled in the north, where they\r\nprepared the way for the Hittite king himself with his regular army,\r\nand where Hittite power became so firmly established that even the\r\ngreat Ramses could not dislodge it, smaller companies of condottieri\r\nmade their way to the extreme south of Palestine, hiring their services\r\nto the rival governors and princes and seizing a town or district\r\nfor themselves when the opportunity offered. So long as the tribute\r\nwas paid, and its subjects were not too troublesome, the Egyptian\r\nGovernment looked on with equanimity while the states of Canaan were\r\npractically ruled by the leaders of foreign mercenaries who transferred\r\ntheir services from one paymaster to another with the most perfect\r\nimpartiality.\r\n\r\nWhat is most curious is that the Imperial Government recognized the\r\nlegal position not only of the Hittite or Amorite mercenaries, but\r\neven of organized bands of Bedâwîn and outlaws. As for the Bedâwîn,\r\nit had companies of them in its own pay, like the Egyptian Government\r\nin more recent times, and the governor of Gebal complains that the\r\nEgyptian commissioner Pa-Hor had sent some of the latter to murder his\r\ngarrison of Serdani or Sardinians, who were themselves mercenaries in\r\nthe Egyptian army. That bodies of outlaws should have been subsidized\r\nby the native princes with the permission, or at least the connivance,\r\nof the Egyptian court may seem surprising. But after all it is only\r\nwhat we find happening in later times when the king of Gath similarly\r\nenrolled David and his band of outlaws into his bodyguard without any\r\nremonstrance on the part of the other Philistine “lords.” Still it is\r\nstartling to find one of the Pharaoh’s governors coolly announcing that\r\nhe and his soldiers and chariots, together with his brothers, his\r\n“cut-throats” and his Bedâwîn, are ready to join the royal troops, at\r\nthe very time when another governor is piteously begging the great king\r\nto “save” him “out of the hands of the cut-throats and Bedâwîn.” Here\r\nis a strange picture of Canaanitish life in the days when as yet the\r\nIsraelite was not in the land.\r\n\r\nThe fact is, the Canaanites were an unwarlike people. Inland, they\r\nwere agriculturists; on the sea-coast they were traders. And, like\r\nother trading communities, they were disinclined to fight, preferring\r\nto entrust the protection of themselves and their property to a\r\npaid soldiery, while at the same time their wealth made them a\r\ntempting prize to the assailant. It is true that they maintained a\r\nnative militia, as we have learned from one of the cuneiform tablets\r\ndiscovered at Taanach, but it was upon a small scale, and apparently\r\nso long as the person on the roll could produce the one or two men for\r\nwhom he was responsible he was not himself obliged to serve. It was\r\nagain a case of paying others to fight instead of themselves.\r\n\r\nThe fighting population of Canaan, in short, were the foreigners, and\r\nthese it was who gradually made themselves its practical masters. The\r\nleaders of the mercenaries became the rulers of the Canaanite states,\r\nwhich thus passed into the hands of a dominant military caste. When\r\nthe Israelites entered the country it was with this military upper\r\nclass that they had principally to deal; where the Canaanite had not\r\nits protection he trusted for his defence to his iron chariots and the\r\nstrong and lofty walls of his towns. It is instructive to read the\r\nlong list of unconquered cities and districts given by the Hebrew\r\nhistorian in the first chapter of the Book of Judges; among them are\r\nthe Jebusites of Jerusalem, while we are told that “the Amorites forced\r\nthe children of Dan into the mountain, for they would not suffer them\r\nto come down to the valley.”\r\n\r\nCanaan, it will probably be thought, was a somewhat insecure country\r\nin which to live in the days of the Egyptian Empire. There seem to\r\nhave been constant turmoil and confusion, governor attacking governor\r\nand bribing bands of foreign mercenaries to help him. But the turmoil\r\nand confusion were mainly on the surface. When a town is taken from\r\none governor by another we do not hear of its population or their\r\npossessions suffering materially; they soon appear upon the scene again\r\nas prosperous as before. It is merely the governor and his immediate\r\nsurroundings who suffer; the capture of the town was probably an affair\r\namicably arranged between the condottieri who were attacking it and\r\nthe condottieri who were its defenders. The Egyptian commissioners go\r\nup and down the country, hearing complaints and settling disputes,\r\nand no one ventures even to protest against their decisions, while a\r\nfew Egyptian troops are stationed in places where the Government was\r\nnot quite sure of the fidelity of its subjects. Caravans of merchants\r\npassed through Canaan going from Egypt to the north, and the traders\r\nof Babylonia and Asia Minor travelled along its high-roads under the\r\nescort of Hittite and other chieftains who were subsidized for the\r\npurpose by the Egyptian court. Even in the days when the Egyptian\r\nGovernment was breaking up, the constant fighting among the foreign\r\nmercenaries and their employers seems to have affected the mass of the\r\npopulation little, if at all.\r\n\r\nWhat happened when the strong hand and controlling power of the\r\nEgyptian Pharaoh were removed we do not yet know. We must look for\r\ninformation to the systematic excavations that are at last being made\r\non the sites of the old Canaanitish towns. Already cuneiform tablets\r\nhave been found on them, and though these belong to the Egyptian period\r\nwe may hope that before long others may be discovered of later date.\r\nWe have still to bridge over the age which elapsed between the final\r\nwithdrawal of Egyptian domination and the conquest of the country\r\nby Philistines and Israelites. When that age begins the script and\r\nofficial language of Canaan are still Babylonian; when it closes\r\nthe cuneiform characters have been superseded by the letters of the\r\nPhœnician alphabet, and the language of the inscriptions engraved in\r\nthem is the language no longer of Babylonia or of Hittite lands, but of\r\nCanaan itself.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nINDEX\r\n\r\n\r\n    Abercromby, the Hon.

Perse, et autres Lieux\r\nde l’Orient, Enrichis de Figures en Tailledouce, qui représentent\r\nles Antiquités et les Choses remarquables du Païs_ (Amsterdam),\r\ntwo pages (167–8) in vol. ii. being devoted to the inscriptions, the\r\ncuneiform being printed on plate lxix.\r\n\r\n[2] The discovery has sometimes been claimed for Tychsen (_De cuneatis\r\nInscriptionibus Persepolitanis Lucubratio_, 1798, p. 24), but Tychsen\r\nsupposed that the wedge was used to divide sentences, not words.\r\n\r\n[3] _Undersögelser om de Persepolitanske Inscriptioner_ (1800),\r\ntranslated into German in

The revival of interest in Grotefend’s work was due\r\nto the fact that Champollion, after the decipherment of the Egyptian\r\nhieroglyphs, found the name of Xerxes on an alabaster vase at Paris on\r\nwhich, according to Grotefend’s system, the same name was written in\r\nPersian cuneiform. This led the Abbé Saint-Martin, who was a recognized\r\nOrientalist, to adopt and follow up Grotefend’s discovery in a Memoir\r\nwhich he read before the French Academy in 1822, and Saint-Martin’s\r\nwork attracted the attention of Rask and Burnouf.\r\n\r\n[5] “Om Zendsprogets,” in the _Skandinaviske Literaturselskabs\r\nSkrifter_, xxi., translated into German in 1826.\r\n\r\n[6] _Mémoire sur deux Inscriptions cunéiformes trouvées près d’Hamadan_\r\n(Paris, 1836).\r\n\r\n[7] _Die Altpersischen Keil-Inschriften von Persepolis_ (Bonn, 1836).\r\n\r\n[8] _Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_, x.\r\n\r\n[9] _Monument de Ninive_, with plates drawn by Flandin.\r\n\r\n[10] See his Memoir, “Sur l’écriture assyrienne,” in the _Journal\r\nasiatique_, 1847–8, ix.-xi.\r\n\r\n[11] _Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy_, xxi. pp. 240 _sqq._ See\r\nalso pp. 114 _sqq._\r\n\r\n[12] _Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy_, xxii. pp. 3 _sqq._\r\n\r\n[13] Edinburgh Meeting, p. 140.\r\n\r\n[14] _Revue archéologique_, 1847, pp. 501 _sqq._\r\n\r\n[15] _Recherches sur l’écriture cunéiforme assyrienne_ (1849).\r\n\r\n[16] _Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_, xii. pp. 401 _sqq._ The\r\ntranslation of the Black Obelisk inscription is given on pp. 431–48.\r\n\r\n[17] _Athenæum_, December 27, 1851.\r\n\r\n[18] In the Paper read by Hincks before the Royal Irish Academy in June\r\n1849, and published the following year.\r\n\r\n[19] For Hincks’s translation of the annals of Sennacherib, see\r\nLayard’s _Nineveh and Babylon_, pp. 139 _sqq._\r\n\r\n[20] _Literary Gazette_, July 5, 1846.\r\n\r\n[21] _Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_, xiv.\r\n\r\n[22] _A List of Assyro-Babylonian Characters_ (1852); also the\r\n_Transactions of the Royal Irish Academy_, xxii.

One fragment\r\nof fine polished yellow ware with traces of black ornamentation\r\nhas recently been reported from Tello by Captain Cros (_Revue\r\nd’Assyriologie_, 1905, p. 59), but the isolated character of the\r\ndiscovery makes it probable that it was an importation from Elam.\r\n\r\n[45] Copper figurines of the goddess, with hands pressed under the\r\nbreasts, found in one of the earliest substructures of Tello (_circa_\r\nB.C. 4000), are published by M.

His attempt to derive it from Cyprus, however, cannot be\r\nsustained in view of its occurrence in Elam.\r\n\r\n[47] _Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archæology_, 1905, p. 28.\r\n\r\n[48] _Ilios_, p. 337. Schliemann called it the Third city.

In Old Egyptian “iron” was similarly\r\n_ba-n-pet_, “stone of heaven,” while “silver” was “white gold,” “gold”\r\nbeing symbolized by a collar. We may compare the Indo-European “white”\r\nmetal as a name of “silver.” The Sumerian _azag-gi_, “gold,” was a form\r\nof _azagga_, “precious,” more especially “precious metal”; the more\r\nspecific word for “gold” was _guskin_, with which the Armenian _oski_\r\nmust be connected. “Silver” was _bábara_, the “bright” metal, _nagga_\r\nbeing “lead,” the Armenian _anag_. The identity of the Armenian and\r\nSumerian words for “gold” and “lead,” coupled with the Armenian origin\r\nof the vine, and the fact that the mountain on which the ark of the\r\nBabylonian Noah rested was Jebel Judi, south of Lake Van, raises an\r\ninteresting question as to the origin of Sumerian civilization.\r\n\r\n[59] It must be remembered, however, that, according to Aristotle, the\r\ncopper of the Mossynœci in Northern Asia Minor was brilliant and white,\r\nowing to its mixture with a species of earth, the exact nature of which\r\nwas kept a secret. The Babylonian ideograph for “bronze,” therefore,\r\nmay have been a similar kind of hardened copper, which was transferred\r\nto denote “bronze” when the alloy of copper and tin became known.\r\n\r\n[60] See Garstang, _El-Arâbah_, p. 10. Dr. Gladstone, however, after\r\ngiving the results of his analysis of the Sixth-dynasty copper\r\ndiscovered by Professor Petrie at Dendera, suggests that the small\r\namount of tin observable in it (about one per cent.) may have been\r\nadded to it artificially (_Dendereh_, p. 61). Bronze was “the normal\r\nmetal” of the Amorite period at Gezer (Macalister, _Quarterly Statement\r\nof the Palestine Exploration Fund_, April 1904, p. 119), and the\r\nthree cities which represent this period go back beyond the age of\r\nthe Twelfth Egyptian dynasty, to at least B.C. 2900 (see _Quarterly\r\nStatement_, January 1905, pp. 28–9). At Troy also Schliemann found\r\nnumerous bronze weapons in the Second (prehistoric) city (_Ilios_, pp.\r\n475–9). In Krete bronze daggers of the Early Minoan period (coeval\r\nwith the Middle Empire of Egypt) have been found at Patema and Agia\r\nTriada (_Annual of the British School at Athens_, x. p. 198), and the\r\npottery of the Middle Minoan period (B.C. 2000–1500) was associated\r\nat Palaikastro with a bronze button, two miniature bronze sickles,\r\nand a pair of bronze tweezers (_ibid._ p. 202). As for the Caucasus,\r\nbronze was not known there till a late date. Wilke (_Zeitschrift für\r\nEthnologie_, 1904, pp. 39–104) has shown that the bronze culture of\r\nthe Caucasus was derived from the valley of the Danube, and made its\r\nway eastward along the northern coast of Pontus; see also Rössler,\r\n_Zeitschrift für Ethnologie_, 1905, p. 118.\r\n\r\n[61] _Dendereh_ (Egypt Exploration Fund), p. 62, for the gold of\r\nthe Sixth dynasty; _The Royal Tombs of the Earliest Dynasties_,\r\npp. 39–40, for that of the First dynasty.\r\n\r\n[62] Vyse, _Pyramids of Gizeh_, i. p. 276. The clamp was actually\r\nfound by his assistant Hill, after blasting away the two outer stones\r\nbehind which it had been placed.\r\n\r\n[63] _Abydos_, part ii. p. 33. An iron pin of the age of the\r\nEighteenth dynasty was found by Garstang at Abydos (_El-Arâbah_,\r\np. 30).\r\n\r\n[64] _Illahun, Kahun and Gurob_, p. 12. Dr. Gladstone’s analyses\r\ngive only about 2 parts of tin to 96·35 of copper. The bronze of the\r\nEighteenth dynasty found at Gurob yielded a less proportion of tin\r\n(about 7 parts to 90 of copper) than the bronze of the Second Assyrian\r\nEmpire. A ring of pure tin, however, was also discovered at Gurob.\r\n\r\n[65] _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, xxxiii. pp. 367\r\n_sqq._\r\n\r\n[66] The two dialects were called _eme_-KU (i.e. _eme-lakhkha_, W.A.I.\r\niii. 4, 31, 32), “the language of the enchanter,” and _eme_-SAL, “the\r\nwoman’s language,” which are rendered in Semitic Babylonian, _lisan\r\nSumeri_ and (_lisan_) _Akkadi_, “the language of Sumer” and “the\r\nlanguage of Akkad.” In a tablet (81, 7–27, 130, 6, 7) they are said\r\nto be “like” one another. Other dialects were termed “the language of\r\nthe sacrificer” and “the language of the anointer,” as being used by\r\nthese two classes of priests. They differed, perhaps, from the standard\r\ndialects in intonation or the use of technical words. We hear also of\r\n“a carter’s language” in which _anbarri_--which, it is noticeable, is a\r\nSumerian word--meant “yoke and reins,” _i.e._ “harness” (_Zeitschrift\r\nfür Assyriologie_, ix. p. 164).\r\n\r\n[67] Fick, however, is an exception (_Beiträge zur Kunde der\r\nindogermanischen Sprachen_, xxix. pp. 229–247.)\r\n\r\n[68] _Mémoires de la Délégation en Perse_, i. pp. 152–3. Photographs of\r\nthe two types--Sumerian and Semitic--represented on the early monuments\r\nof Babylonia are given by Dr. Pinches in an interesting Paper in the\r\n_Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_, January 1900, pp. 87–93.\r\n\r\n[69] It is noticeable that the script of the other people whose\r\ncivilization grew up on the banks of a river, the Egyptians namely,\r\ncontains no special ideograph for “river.” The word is expressed by the\r\nphonetically-written _atur_, with the determinative of “water” or\r\n“irrigation basin.” As in the primitive hieroglyphs of Babylonia, “the\r\nsea” was a “circle.”\r\n\r\n[70] For proof of this reading see _Expository Times_, xvii. p. 416 and\r\nnote _infra_, p. 91.\r\n\r\n[71] See my _Religions of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia_, pp. 373–84.\r\n\r\n[72] Taylor found quantities of sea-shells in its ruins (_Journal\r\nof the Royal Asiatic Society_, xv. p. 412). At the time of its\r\nfoundation an arm of the sea probably ran up to it from the south-east,\r\nthough the myth of Adamu describes him as fishing each day in the\r\nwaters of the actual Gulf, rather than in an arm of it.\r\n\r\n[73] The Moon-god of Ur was a “son” of El-lil, the god of Nippur.\r\n\r\n[74] For proof of this see my _Religion of the Ancient Babylonians_, p.\r\n105.\r\n\r\n[75] A tablet obtained by Dr. Hayes Ward divides Sippara into four\r\nquarters, “Sippara of Eden,” “Sippara that is from everlasting,”\r\n“Sippara of the Sun-god,” and “Sippara,” which may be the “Sippara\r\nof Anunit” or “Sippara of Aruru,” the creatress of man, of other\r\ninscriptions. Amelon or Amelu, “man,” who corresponds with the Enos of\r\nScripture, is said in the fragments of Berossus to have belonged to\r\nPantibibla, or “Book-town,” and since Euedoranchus of Pantibibla, the\r\ncounterpart of the Biblical Enoch, is the monumental Enme-dhur-anki\r\nof Sippara, it is clear that Pantibibla is a play on the supposed\r\nsignification of Sippara (from _sipru_, “a writing” or “book”). The\r\nclaim to immemorial antiquity made on behalf of Sippara may be due to\r\nthe fact that Akkad, the seat of the first Semitic empire, was either\r\nin the immediate neighbourhood of Sippara or another name of one of the\r\nfour quarters of Sippara itself.\r\n\r\n[76] _Chaldæa and Susiana_, p. 282.\r\n\r\n[77] _Journal of the Royal Geographical Society_, xxvii. p. 186.\r\nRawlinson calculated the rate of advance from that made by the\r\nBabylonian Delta between 1793 and 1833. In the age of Strabo and\r\nArrian the Tigris and Euphrates were not yet united, while in the\r\ntime of Nearchus (B.C. 335) the mouth of the Euphrates was 345 miles\r\nfrom Babylon. De Morgan calculates that between the age of Nearchus\r\nand that of Sennacherib, when the Euphrates had not yet joined the\r\nmore rapid Tigris, the rate of increase must have been much slower\r\nthan it is to-day and have not exceeded eighty metres a year. In the\r\nage of Sennacherib Eridu was already seventy miles distant from the\r\ncoast (de Morgan, _Mémoires de la Délégation en Perse_, i. pp. 5–23).\r\nThe distance from the Shatt el-Arab (the united stream of the Tigris\r\nand Euphrates) to the end of the alluvium in the Persian Gulf is 277\r\nkilometres, or 172 miles. Some idea of the appearance of the coast in\r\nthe Abrahamic age may be gained from the map of the world drawn by a\r\nBabylonian tourist in the time of Khammu-rabi which I have published in\r\nthe _Expository Times_, November 1906.\r\n\r\n[78] There is a striking resemblance between the primitive Babylonian\r\npicture of a boat and the sailing boat depicted on the prehistoric\r\npottery of Egypt, for which last see Capart, _Les Débuts de l’Art en\r\nEgypte_, p. 116.\r\n\r\n[79] Perhaps, however, this was really due to the accidental similarity\r\nof sound between _gi_, “a reed,” and _gin_, “to be firm.”\r\n\r\n[80] The various forms of vases represented in the early pictography\r\nare given by de Morgan in a very instructive article, “Sur les procédés\r\ntechniques en usage chez les scribes babyloniens,” in the _Recueil\r\ndes Travaux relatifs à la Philologie et à l’Archéologie égyptiennes et\r\nassyriennes_, xxvii. 3, 4 (1905). Among special vases were those\r\nfor oil, wine and honey. The butter or oil jar was closed with a clay\r\nsealing exactly like those of early Egypt. Vases with spouts were also\r\nused.\r\n\r\n[81] The American excavations at Askabad have shown that the\r\ndomestication of animals, including the camel, took place during the\r\nneolithic age, the goat being one of the last to be tamed.\r\n\r\n[82] This, however, is not absolutely certain, since the ideograph\r\nwhich, denotes an “ass” originally signified merely “a yoked beast.”\r\n\r\n[83] Peters, _Nippur_, ii. p. 299.\r\n\r\n[84] Thus in the great historical inscription of Entemena, King of\r\nLagas (B.C. 4000), M. Thureau Dangin is probably right in seeing in\r\n_dam-kha-ra_ (col. i. 26) a Semitic word. In fact where a word is\r\nwritten syllabically, that is to say phonetically, in a Sumerian text\r\nthere is an _a priori_ probability that it is a loan-word.\r\n\r\n[85] This may of course have been only a literary archaism. But if the\r\nkings were really of Semitic origin, it is difficult to understand why\r\nthey should have been ashamed of being called by their native Semitic\r\nnames.\r\n\r\n[86] See Hommel, _Grundriss der Geographie und Geschichte des Alten\r\nOrients_, i. pp. 79–82.\r\n\r\n[87] Hitherto read A-da-pa. But the character =PA= had the value\r\nof _mu_ when it signified “man,” according to a tablet quoted by\r\nFossey, _Contribution au Dictionnaire Sumérien-assyrienne_, No.\r\n2666, and in writing early Babylonian names or words the characters\r\nwith the requisite phonetic values were selected which harmonized\r\nideographically with the sense of the words. Thus out of the various\r\ncharacters which had the phonetic value of _mu_ that was chosen\r\nwhich denoted “man” when the name of the first man was needed to be\r\nwritten. The Semitic Adamu, which M. Thureau Dangin has found used as\r\na proper name in tablets from Tello of the age of Sargon of Akkad,\r\nwas borrowed from the Sumerian _adam_, which signified “animal,”\r\nand then, more specifically “man.” Thus in the bilingual story of the\r\ncreation we have (l. 9) _uru nu-dim adam nu-mun-ya_, “a city was\r\nnot built, a man was not made to stand upright,” and a list of slaves\r\npublished by Dr. Scheil (_Recueil de Travaux_, etc., xx. p. 65) is\r\ndated in “the year when Rim-Anum the king (conquered) the land of ...\r\nbi and its inhabitants” (_adam-bi_). See above, p. 76.\r\n\r\n[88] _Records of the Past_, New Series, iii. pp. 124–7.\r\n\r\n[89] Erech was one of the earliest of the Semitic settlements in the\r\nBabylonian plain, and Erech was known later as _’supuru_, “the\r\nsheepfold,” as is shown by its ideographic equivalent.\r\n\r\n[90] _The Religions of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia_, pp. 276–80.\r\n\r\n[91] See my _Religions of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia_, pp. 276–89,\r\n348–61.\r\n\r\n[92] If, however, the Sumerian pictograph for “city” represents a\r\ntower on a mound, as seems to be the case, the identity in form of the\r\nEgyptian hieroglyph cannot be an accident, since both the tower and\r\nthe artificial platform were essentially Babylonian. In the cursive\r\ncuneiform two separate pictographs have coalesced, one representing a\r\nseat, the other what appears to be a tower on a mound.\r\n\r\n[93] In Egyptian, however, the bird stands over a door, while in\r\nBabylonian it is over the two-legged stool on which two vases of\r\nofferings are set when it is used to denote the image of a god.\r\nThe Sumerian pictograph for “(divine) lord” or “lady” (NIN) is the\r\nrepresentation of a similar vase on a mat, and thus has the same form\r\nas the Egyptian _hotep_. The Egyptian _nefer_, “good,” finds its exact\r\ncounterpart in the Babylonian pictograph of “ornament” (ME-TE). The\r\nBabylonian “house,” too, is given the same tower-like shape as the\r\nEgyptian (_āhā_).\r\n\r\n[94] In a short Paper entitled _Lexicalische Belege zu meinen Vortrag\r\nüber die sprachliche Stellung des Altægyptischen_ (1895), in which\r\nhe has attempted to draw up a list of phonetic equivalences between\r\nEgyptian and Sumerian. In this, however, I am unable to follow him, as\r\nhis comparisons of Egyptian and Sumerian words are not convincing.\r\n\r\n[95] See de Morgan, _Recherches sur les Origines de l’Egypte_, pp.\r\n94, 95. According to Schweinfurth, barley, which is also found in the\r\nprehistoric graves of Egypt, must originally have come from Babylonia\r\nlike the wheat. _Qemḥu_ is found in the Pyramid texts (Maspero,\r\n_Recueil de Travaux relatifs à la Philologie et à l’Archéologie\r\négyptiennes et assyriennes_, v. p. 10). _Boti_, whence the Coptic\r\n_bôti_ and the _battawa_ or “durra cake” of modern Egyptian Arabic, was\r\n“durra,” not “wheat.”\r\n\r\n[96] See Maspero, _Études de Mythologie_, ii. pp. 313 _sqq._\r\n\r\n[97] I have put “Lower” between parentheses since it is very\r\nquestionable whether this particular system of registering time was\r\nknown in the Delta until it was introduced from Upper Egypt. On the\r\nPalermo stone a list of the early kings of Lower Egypt is given, but\r\nwithout any dates, which make their appearance along with the kings of\r\nthe First dynasty, who belonged to Upper Egypt. It is interesting to\r\nobserve that the ideograph for “year” is denoted in exactly the same\r\nway in both the Babylonian and the Egyptian hieroglyphs by the branch\r\nof a (palm) tree. Such a curious symbol for the idea can hardly have\r\nbeen invented independently. Professor Hommel further draws attention\r\nto the fact that while the literal translation of a common ideographic\r\nmode of representing “year” in Babylonian is “name of heaven,” that of\r\nthe two syllables of the Egyptian word _renpet_, “year,” would\r\nalso be “name of heaven.”\r\n\r\n[98] _Hierakonpolis_, part i. plate xxix. The name of the king is\r\nusually (but erroneously) written Nar-Mer.\r\n\r\n[99] As the royal figures wear no crowns, they can hardly depict the\r\nking in his double office of king of Upper and Lower Egypt, and the\r\nduplication of the Pharaoh must consequently have a purely artistic\r\norigin. That this artistic origin is closely connected with the origin\r\nof the seal-cylinders is shown by the fact that the figures correspond\r\nwith one of the most common designs on the latter, in which the _ka_ of\r\nthe person to whom the cylinder belonged is seated on a chair similar\r\nto that of the El-Kab king, an altar with offerings of bread being set\r\nbefore him.\r\n\r\n[100] The eye and the ideograph of city or place. Since the eye here\r\nhas the phonetic value of _eri_ or _ari_, the ideograph of “city,”\r\nwhich is _eri_ in Sumerian, must have the Egyptian value of _as_.\r\n\r\n[101] See my _Religions of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia_, p. 238.\r\n\r\n[102] _Comptes rendus de l’Académie des Inscriptions et Belles\r\nLettres_, 4 Sér., 1899, xxvii. pp. 60–67; see _Hierakonpolis_, part ii.\r\nplate xxviii. In the _Revue d’Assyriologie_, v. pp. 29–32, Heuzey has\r\nlately drawn attention to the resemblance between the early Egyptian\r\nand Babylonian bowls of calcite or Egyptian alabaster.\r\n\r\n[103] _Lectures on the Religion of the Ancient Babylonians_, 1887,\r\np. 33.\r\n\r\n[104] _Nature_, August 9, 1883, p. 341.\r\n\r\n[105] Daressy, “Le Cercueil d’Emsaht,” in the _Annales du Service des\r\nAntiquités de l’Égypte_, 1899, i. pp. 79–90.\r\n\r\n[106] I have called Upper Egypt the seat of the first Pharaohs, not\r\nonly because the earliest dynastic monuments we possess come from\r\nthence, but also because it was of Upper Egypt and its ruling caste\r\nthat the hawk-god Horus was the guardian deity. From Upper Egypt he\r\nwas carried to Lower Egypt and its nomes, presumably through conquest,\r\nas is monumentally attested by the “palette” of Nar-Buzau discovered\r\nat Hierakonpolis (Capart, _Débuts de l’Art en Égypte_, p. 236).\r\nSo, too, the anthropomorphic Osiris--the duplicate of Anhur--made his\r\nway from the south to the north. That Southern Arabia should have been\r\nthe connecting-link between Babylonia and Egypt was the result of its\r\nbeing the source of the incense which was imported for religious use\r\ninto both countries alike at the very beginning of their histories.\r\nThat this foreign product should have been considered an indispensable\r\nadjunct of the religions of the two civilizations is one of the best\r\nproofs we have of their connection with one another. Dr. Schweinfurth\r\nhas shown that the sacred trees of Egypt--the sycamore and the\r\npersea--which needed artificial cultivation for their preservation\r\nthere, came from Southern Arabia, where he found them growing wild\r\nunder the names of _Khanes, Burra and Lebakh_ (_Verhandlungen\r\nder Gesellschaft für Erdkünde zu Berlin_, July 1889, No. 7).\r\n\r\n[107] In the possession of Lord Amherst of Hackney. On an early\r\nBabylonian seal-cylinder, bought by Dr. Scheil at Mossul and figured in\r\nthe _Recueil de Travaux relatifs à la Philologie et à l’Archéologie\r\négyptiennes et assyriennes_, xix. 1, 2, No. 7 of the plate, we have:\r\n“Ili-su-bani son of Aminanum, servant of the gods Bel and Anupum.”\r\nAminanum may be a Semitized form of the Egyptian Ameni.\r\n\r\n[108] Pp. 133, 139, 485.\r\n\r\n[109] De Morgan, _Recherches sur les Origines de l’Égypte_, p. 65.\r\n\r\n[110] Scheil, _Recueil de Travaux relatifs à la Philologie et à\r\nl’Archéologie égyptiennes et assyriennes_, xix. pp. 50, 54; Sayce,\r\n_Religions of Ancient Egypt and Babylonia_, p. 485. The dwarf\r\nis represented as dancing before the god Sin on an early Babylonian\r\nseal-cylinder published by Scheil in the _Recueil_, xix. 1, 2, No.\r\n16 of the plate.\r\n\r\n[111] It is worth notice that the dwarf-god Bes, who is called “God of\r\nPunt” in inscriptions of the Ptolemaic age, appears on Arab coins of\r\nthe Roman period (Schweinfurth, _Verhandlungen der Gesellschaft für\r\nErdkunde 1889_, No. 7).\r\n\r\n[112] Layard, _Monuments of Nineveh_, Second Series, pl. 15.\r\n\r\n[113] Herodotus, i. 193.\r\n\r\n[114] The rope appears to have been _makutum_; see _W.

He there enumerates (1) the resemblance between the stone\r\nmace-heads of the two countries in “prehistoric times,” as well as\r\nbetween the flat dishes of veined and ribboned onyx marble, hollowed\r\nand rounded by the hand; (2) between the lion-heads of stone, the onyx\r\nstone of one of which is stated in an inscription to have come from\r\nMagan; (3) the extraordinary likeness in the delineation of animal\r\nforms, which extends to conventional details “like the two concentric\r\ncurves artificially arranged so as to allow the two corners of the\r\nprofile to be visible at the same time”; (4) the use of a razor and\r\nthe custom of completely shaving the face, and even the skull; and (5)\r\nthe ceremonial form of libation by means of a vase of peculiar shape,\r\nwith a long curved spout and without a handle. This libation vase was\r\npractically the same in both countries, in spite of its peculiar and\r\nsomewhat complicated form. Of later introduction into Egypt was the\r\ninscribed cone of terra-cotta, which was of early Babylonian origin,\r\nbut is not met with in Egypt before the age of the Twelfth dynasty.\r\nAt any rate, the first specimens of it hitherto found there were\r\ndiscovered by myself at Ed-Dêr, opposite Esna, in 1905 (_Annales du\r\nService des Antiquités de l’Égypte_, 1905, pp. 164–5).\r\n\r\n[117] _Recueil de Travaux_, etc., xvi. p. 190.\r\n\r\n[118] In the later bronze or “Mykenæan” age the seal-cylinders are of a\r\ndifferent type, and are engraved on a black artificial paste resembling\r\nhæmatite (Myres and Ohnefalsch-Richter, _Catalogue of the Cyprus\r\nMuseum_, p. 32).\r\n\r\n[119] Sayce, _Transactions of the Society of Biblical Archæology_,\r\n1877, v. part ii.; Bezold, _Zeitschrift für Keilinschrift_, 1885,\r\npp. 191–3.\r\n\r\n[120] _Proceedings of the Society of Biblical Archæology_, November\r\n1905, plate No. 11\r\n\r\n[121] A cadastral survey, which was drawn up at this period under\r\nUru-malik, or Urimelech, “the governor of the land of the Amorites,”\r\nwould, if perfect, have given us an interesting description of Syria\r\nand Palestine in the third millennium before our era; see Thureau\r\nDangin in the _Revue Sémitigue_, Avril 1897.\r\n\r\n[122] See Heuzey, in the _Revue d’Assyriologie_, 1897, pp. 1–12.\r\n\r\n[123] This was “the year when Samsu-iluna the king gave Merodach a\r\nshining mace of gold and silver, the glory of the temple; it made\r\nE-Saggil (the temple of Bel-Merodach at Babylon) shine like the stars\r\nof heaven.” The title of the year was derived from the chief event, or\r\nevents, that characterized it. See Dr. Pinches, in the _Quarterly\r\nStatement of the Palestine Exploration Fund_, April and July 1900,\r\npp. 269–73.\r\n\r\n[124] See my analysis of some of the Hyksos names in the _Proceedings\r\nof the Society of Biblical Archæology_, 1901, pp. 95–8. Since the\r\npublication of the Paper other names of the same type, like Rabu and\r\nSakti, have come to light. The characteristic names of the Hyksos\r\nprinces recur among the “Amorite” names found in the contract tablets\r\nof the Khammu-rabi period, but not later. The abbreviated forms of the\r\nnames met with on the Egyptian scarabs are also found in the tablets.\r\nIndeed, the contracted form of Ya’qub-el, that is to say, Yakubu,\r\nwith _k_ instead of _q_, must have been transcribed from a cuneiform\r\noriginal.\r\n\r\n[125] Macalister, _Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration\r\nFund_, January 1903, p. 28. It is the seventh stone, however,\r\nwhich alone has been brought from a distance--the neighbourhood of\r\nJerusalem--all the others being of local origin (_Quarterly Statement_,\r\nJuly 1904, pp. 194–5).\r\n\r\n[126] See Sellin, _Tell Ta’annek_ (1904) and _Eine Nachlese auf dem\r\nTell Ta’annek in Palästina_ (1905).\r\n\r\n[127] _Tell Ta’annek_, pp. 27–8. The cylinder is earlier than B.C. 2000.\r\n\r\n[128] See my _Patriarchal Palestine_, pp. 60, 61.\r\n\r\n[129] _Collection De Clercq, Catalogue méthodique et raisonné_, i.\r\np. 217.\r\n\r\n[130] _Quarterly Statement of the Palestine Exploration Fund_, January\r\n1905, pp. 28, 29.\r\n\r\n[131] The chronological difficulty, however, would be partially solved\r\nif the date recently proposed by Professor Petrie (_Researches in\r\nSinai_, ch. xii.) for the Twelfth dynasty--B.C. 3459–3250--be adopted.\r\nThe Twelfth dynasty would in this case have reigned a thousand years\r\nbefore the dynasty of Khammu-rabi, whose domination in Palestine would\r\nhave been an interlude in the history of the Hyksos period, while the\r\nconquest of Canaan by Sargon and Naram-Sin would have coincided with\r\nthe supersession of the neolithic population by the “Amorites,” who\r\nbrought with them the copper and the culture of Babylonia.\r\n\r\n[132] Unless we except the gold and silver ornaments found on the body\r\nof a woman in a deserted house at Taanach, which, as Dr. Sellin says,\r\nare by themselves sufficient to remove “all grounds for doubting such\r\naccounts as those in Joshua vii. 21, and Judges viii. 26” (_Eine\r\nNachlese auf dem Tell Ta’annek_, p. 32).\r\n\r\n[133] _Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_, New Series, xiv. 3,\r\n4, pp. 377–732.\r\n\r\n[134] Eustathius on Dion.

See Lehmann in the\r\n_Zeitschrift für Assyriologie_, 1894, pp. 90 and 358–60.\r\n\r\n[135] The Vannic kings always call themselves kings, not of the\r\nKhaldians, but of Biainas or Bianas, the Byana of Ptolemy, the Van of\r\nto-day.\r\n\r\n[136] See more especially Belck’s comparison of the Vannic pottery\r\nwith that of the Assyrian colony of Kara Eyuk, near Kaisariyeh, in\r\nthe _Verhandlungen der Berliner anthropologischen Gesellschaft_,\r\nDecember 1901, p. 493. Besides the highly-polished lustrous red ware,\r\nhe found at Kara Eyuk fragments of the same wheel-made wine-jars, “of\r\ngigantic size,” which characterized Toprak Kaleh, near Van. Similar\r\njars, as well as lustrous red pottery, were discovered by Schliemann\r\nin the “prehistoric” strata at Troy. The animals’ heads in terra-cotta\r\nfound at Kara Eyuk are stated by Dr. Belck to be similar to those of\r\nthe Digalla Tepé, near Urumiya. For further details see _infra._\r\n\r\n[137] See Pinches in the _Journal of the Royal Asiatic Society_,\r\n1897, pp. 589–613; and myself in the _Proceedings of the Society of\r\nBiblical Archæology_, 1897, p. 286.\r\n\r\n[138] Thus we find from the Cappadocian cuneiform tablets discovered\r\nat Kara Eyuk, north-east of Kaisariyeh, that time was reckoned by the\r\nannual succession of officers called _limmi_ as in Assyria.\r\n\r\n[139] _Dendereh_, p. 62.\r\n\r\n[140] Chantre, _Mission en Cappadoce_, pp. 71–91.\r\n\r\n[141] See Belck, _Verhandlungen der Berliner anthropologischen\r\nGesellschaft_, December 1901, p. 493; and the admirable plates, iii.,\r\nvii.–xiv., in Chantre, _Mission en Cappadoce_. As has been already\r\nmentioned (_supra_, p. 166), Dr. Belck noticed at Kara Eyuk coarse\r\nsherds of great thickness coming from wine-jars similar to those of\r\nToprak Kaleh. The black vases with long spouts have been found at\r\nYortan and Boz Eyuk in Phrygia; long-spouted vases of yellow ware with\r\ngeometrical patterns in maroon-red on the site of Gordium.\r\n\r\nChantre discovered numerous spindle-whorls in the ruins similar to\r\nthose discovered at Troy. He also found terra-cotta figurines, among\r\nwhich the ram is the most plentiful, as well as covers and handles of\r\nvases in the shape of animals’ heads, and some curious hut-urns not\r\nunlike those of Latium. Few bronze objects were met with, but among\r\nthem were five flanged axe-heads of the incurved Egyptian Hyksos type,\r\ntotally unlike the straight bronze axe-heads from Troy and Angora\r\n(of Egyptian I-XII dynasty form), with which M. Chantre compares\r\nthem. The obsidian implements and stone celts were of the ordinary\r\nAsianic pattern. M. Chantre notes that whereas at Troy the terra-cotta\r\nfigurines represented the heads of oxen or cows, at Kara Eyuk they were\r\nthe heads of sheep, horses, and perhaps dogs.\r\n\r\n[142] _Historical Geography of Asia Minor_, ch. i., ii.; _Cities and\r\nBishoprics of Phrygia_, i. p. xiv.\r\n\r\n[143] Labawa, or Labbaya, for whom see the next chapter. A revised\r\ntranscript of his letter in Arzawan (Hittite) is given by Knudtzon,\r\n_Die zwei Arzawa-Briefe_, pp. 38–40. The introductory paragraph\r\nshould read: _Ata-mu kît Labbaya ... memis-ta Uan-wa-nnas\r\niskhani-tta-ra atari-ya ueni_.--“To my lord says Labbaya ... thy\r\nservant of Uan (a district west of Aleppo); seven times I prostrate\r\nmyself.” In other letters Labbaya is called prince of Rukhizzi, the\r\nRokhe’s-na of the treaty between Ramses II. and the Hittites.\r\n\r\n[144] The facts were first stated in my article in the _Contemporary\r\nReview_, August 1905, pp. 264–77, which is reprinted as chapter vii.\r\nof the present book.\r\n\r\n[145] _Journal of the Anthropological Institute_, 1903, xxxiii. pp.\r\n367–400.\r\n\r\n[146] By Shalmaneser II.

What seem to be similar characters on a\r\nseal-cylinder found in the copper-age cemetery of Agia Paraskevi in\r\nCyprus have recently been published by me in the _Proceedings of the\r\nSociety of Biblical Archæology_, June 1906, plate ii. No. xi. See\r\nabove, p. 141.\r\n\r\n[148] One of these seals, with the name of Tua-is, “the Charioteer,” in\r\nHittite hieroglyphs, is in the possession of M. de Clercq.

(1882). For the Babylonian\r\nprototype, see Boissier, _Note sur un Monument babylonien se rapportant\r\nâ l’extispicine_ (1899).\r\n\r\n[156] Labbawa, or Labawa, is written Labbaya in the letter which is in\r\nthe Arzawan language.\r\n\r\n[157] A copy of the text (Louvre, C 1) is given by Professor Breasted\r\nin the _American Journal of Semitic Languages and Literature_,\r\nxxi. 3 (1905). The determinative attached to the name is not that of\r\n“country” but of “going,” showing that the scribe supposed the name to\r\nbe connected with some otherwise unknown word that signified “to go,”\r\njust as in Gen. xxiii. “The sons of Heth” are supposed by the Hebrew\r\nwriter to derive their name from the Hebrew _khath_, “terror.”\r\n\r\n\r\nTranscriber’s Notes:\r\n\r\n1.
