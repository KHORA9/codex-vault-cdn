And not only have the author's investigations extended\r\nover a very wide range, as will be seen by the references contained in\r\nthe footnotes to this volume, but during the past ten years he has paid\r\nfrequent visits to the Champagne--to its vineyards and vendangeoirs,\r\nand to the establishments of the chief manufacturers of sparkling wine,\r\nthe preparation of which he has witnessed in all its phases. Visits\r\nhave, moreover, been made to various other localities where sparkling\r\nwines are produced, and more or less interesting information gathered\r\nregarding the latter. In the pursuit of his researches, the author's\r\nposition as wine juror at the Vienna and Paris Exhibitions opened up to\r\nhim many sources of information inaccessible to others less favourably\r\ncircumstanced, and these his general knowledge of wine, acquired during\r\nmany years' careful study, enabled him to turn to advantageous account.\r\n\r\nThe numerous illustrations scattered throughout the present volume\r\nhave been derived from every available source that suggested itself.\r\nAncient /MSS./, early-printed books, pictures and pieces of sculpture,\r\nengravings and caricatures, all of greater or less rarity, have been\r\nlaid under contribution; and in addition, nearly two hundred original\r\nsketches have been made under the author's immediate superintendence,\r\nwith the object of illustrating the principal localities and their more\r\npicturesque features, and depicting all matters of interest connected\r\nwith the growth and manipulation of the various sparkling wines which\r\nare here described.\r\n\r\nIn the preparation of this work, and more particularly the historical\r\nportions of it, the author has been largely assisted by his nephew, Mr.\r\nMontague Vizetelly, to whom he tenders his warmest acknowledgments for\r\nthe valuable services rendered by him.\r\n\r\nIt should be stated that portions of the volume, relating to the\r\nvintaging and manufacture of sparkling wines generally, have been\r\npreviously published under the title of _Facts about Champagne and\r\nother Sparkling Wines_, but they have been subjected to considerable\r\nextension and revision before being permitted to reappear in their\r\npresent form.\r\n\r\n    St. Leonards-on-Sea, February 1882.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nCONTENTS.\r\n\r\n\r\n    /Part

Marseilles,\r\nNarbonne, and Vienne were celebrated by Roman writers prior to the\r\nChristian era, many centuries elapsed before a vintage was gathered\r\nwithin the limits of the ancient province of Champagne. Whilst the\r\nvine and olive throve in the sunny soil of the Narbonnese Gaul, the\r\nfrigid climate of the as yet uncultivated North forbade the production\r\nof either wine or oil.[1] The 'forest of the Marne,' now renowned\r\nfor the vintage it yields, was then indeed a dark and gloomy wood,\r\nthe haunt of the wolf and wild boar, the stag and the auroch; and\r\nthe tall barbarians of Gallia Comata, who manned the walls of Reims\r\non the approach of Cæsar, were fain to quaff defiance to the Roman\r\npower in mead and ale.[2] Though Reims became under the Roman dominion\r\none of the capitals of Belgic Gaul, and acquired an importance to\r\nwhich numerous relics in the shape of temples, triumphal arches,\r\nbaths, arenas, military roads, &c., amply testify; and though the\r\nGauls were especially distinguished by their quick adoption of Roman\r\ncustoms, it appears certain that during the sway of the twelve Cæsars\r\nthe inhabitants of the present Champagne district were forced to\r\ndraw the wine, with which their amphoræ were filled and their pateræ\r\nreplenished, from extraneous sources. The vintages of which Pliny and\r\nColumella have written were confined to Gallia Narboniensis, though the\r\nculture of the vine had doubtless made some progress in Aquitaine and\r\non the banks of the Saône, when the stern edict of the fly-catching\r\nmadman Domitian, issued on the plea that the plant of Bacchus usurped\r\nspace which would be better filled by that of Ceres, led (/A.D./ 92) to\r\nits total uprooting throughout the Gallic territory.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor nearly two hundred years this strange edict remained in force,\r\nduring which period all the wine consumed in the Gallo-Roman dominions\r\nwas imported from abroad. Six generations of men, to whom the cheerful\r\ntoil of the vine-dresser was but an hereditary tale, and the joys of\r\nthe vintage a half-forgotten tradition, had passed away when, in 282,\r\nthe Emperor Probus, a gardener's son, once more granted permission to\r\ncultivate the vine, and even exercised his legions in the laying-out\r\nand planting of vineyards in Gaul.[3] The culture was eagerly resumed,\r\nand, as with the advancement of agriculture and the clearance of\r\nforests the climate had gradually improved, the inhabitants of the\r\nmore northern regions sought to emulate their southern neighbours in\r\nthe production of wine. This concession of Probus was hailed with\r\nrejoicing; and some antiquaries maintain that the triumphal arch at\r\nReims, known as the Gate of Mars, was erected during his reign as a\r\ntoken of gratitude for this permission to replant the vine.[4]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE GATE OF MARS AT REIMS.]\r\n\r\nBy the fourth century the banks of the Marne and the Moselle were\r\nclothed with vineyards, which became objects of envy and desire to\r\nthe yellow-haired tribes of Germany,[5] and led in no small degree\r\nto the predatory incursions into the territory of Reims so severely\r\nrepulsed by Julian the Apostate and the Consul Jovinus, who had aided\r\nJulian to ascend the throne of the Cæsars, and had combatted for him\r\nagainst the Persians. Julian assembled his forces at Reims in 356,\r\nbefore advancing against the Alemanni, who had established themselves\r\nin Alsace and Lorraine; and ten years later the Consul Jovinus, after\r\nsurprising some of the same nation bathing their large limbs, combing\r\ntheir long and flaxen hair, and 'swallowing huge draughts of rich and\r\ndelicious wine,'[6] on the banks of the Moselle, fought a desperate and\r\nsuccessful battle, lasting an entire summer's day, on the Catalaunian\r\nplains near Châlons, with their comrades, whom the prospect of similar\r\nindulgence had tempted to enter the Champagne. Valerian came to Reims\r\nin 367 to congratulate Jovinus; and the Emperor and the Consul (whose\r\ntomb is to-day preserved in Reims Cathedral) fought their battles o'er\r\nagain over their cups in the palace reared by the latter on the spot\r\noccupied in later years by the church of St. Nicaise.\r\n\r\nThe check administered by Jovinus was but temporary, while the\r\nattraction continued permanent. For nearly half a century, it is\r\ntrue, the vineyards of the Champagne throve amidst an era of quiet\r\nand prosperity such as had seldom blessed the frontier provinces of\r\nGaul.[7] But when, in 406, the Vandals spread the flame of war from the\r\nbanks of the Rhine to the Alps, the Pyrenees, and the ocean, Reims was\r\nsacked, its fields ravaged, its bishop cut down at the altar, and its\r\ninhabitants slain or made captive; and the same scene of desolation was\r\nrepeated when the hostile myriads of Attila swept across north-western\r\nFrance in 451.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TOMB OF THE CONSUL JOVINUS, PRESERVED IN REIMS\r\nCATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nHappier times were, however, in store for Reims and its bishops and its\r\nvineyards, the connection between the two last being far more intimate\r\nthan might be supposed. When Clovis and his Frankish host passed\r\nthrough Reims by the road still known as the Grande Barberie, on his\r\nway to attack Syagrius in 486, there was no doubt a little pillaging,\r\nand the famous golden vase which one of the monarch's followers\r\ncarried off from the episcopal residence was not left unfilled by its\r\nnew owner. But after Syagrius had been crushed at Soissons, and the\r\ntheft avenged by a blow from the king's battle-axe, Clovis not only\r\nrestored the stolen vase, and made a treaty with the bishop St. Remi\r\nor Remigius, son of Emilius, Count of Laon, but eventually became a\r\nconvert to Christianity, and accepted baptism at his hands. Secular\r\nhistory has celebrated the fight of Tolbiac--the invocation addressed\r\nby the despairing Frank to the God of the Christians; the sudden\r\nrallying of his fainting troops, and the last desperate charge which\r\nswept away for ever the power of the Alemanni as a nation. Saintly\r\nlegends have enlarged upon the piety of Queen Clotilda; the ability of\r\nSt. Remi; the pomp and ceremony which marked the baptism of Clovis at\r\nReims in December 496; the memorable injunction of the bishop to his\r\nroyal convert to adore the cross he had burnt, and burn the idols he\r\nhad hitherto adored; and the miracle of the Sainte Ampoule, a vial of\r\nholy oil said to have been brought direct from heaven by a snow-white\r\ndove in honour of the occasion. A pigeon, however, has always been\r\na favourite item in the conjuror's paraphernalia from the days of\r\nApolonius of Tyana and Mahomet down to those of Houdin and Dr. Lynn;\r\nand modern scepticism has suggested that the celestial regions were\r\nnone other than the episcopal dovecot. Whether or not the oil was holy,\r\nwe may be certain that the wine which flowed freely in honour of the\r\nFrankish monarch's conversion was ambrosial; that the fierce warriors\r\nwho had conquered at Soissons and Tolbiac wetted their long moustaches\r\nin the choicest growths that had ripened on the surrounding hills; and\r\nthat the Counts and Leudes, and, judging from national habits, the King\r\nhimself, got royally drunk upon a _cuvée réservée_ from the vineyard\r\nwhich St. Remi had planted with his own hands on his hereditary estate\r\nnear Laon, or the one which the slave Melanius cultivated for him just\r\nwithout the walls of Reims.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFor the saint was not only a converter of kings, but, what is of\r\nmore moment to us, a cultivator of vineyards and an appreciator of\r\ntheir produce. Amongst the many miracles which monkish chroniclers\r\nhave ascribed to him is one commemorated by a bas-relief on the north\r\ndoorway of Reims Cathedral, representing him in the house of one of\r\nhis relatives, named Celia, making the sign of the cross over an empty\r\ncask, which, as a matter of course, immediately became filled with\r\nwine. That St. Remi possessed such an ample stock of wine of his own as\r\nto have been under no necessity to repeat this miracle in the episcopal\r\npalace is evident from the will penned by him during his last illness\r\nin 530, as this shows his viticultural and other possessions to have\r\nbeen sufficiently extensive to have contented a bishop even of the most\r\npluralistic proclivities.[8]\r\n\r\nIt is curious to note the connection between the spread of viticulture\r\nand that of Christianity--a connection apparently incongruous, and yet\r\nevident enough, when it is remembered that wine is necessary for the\r\ncelebration of the most solemn sacrament of the Church. Christianity\r\nbecame the established religion of the Roman Empire about the first\r\ndecade of the fourth century, and Paganism was prohibited by Theodosius\r\nat its close; and it is during this period that we find the culture of\r\nthe grape spreading throughout Gaul, and St. Martin of Tours preaching\r\nthe Gospel and planting a vineyard coevally. Chapters and religious\r\nhouses especially applied themselves to the cultivation of the vine,\r\nand hence the origin of many famous vineyards, not only of the\r\nChampagne but of France. The old monkish architects, too, showed their\r\nappreciation of the vine by continually introducing sculptured festoons\r\nof vine-leaves, intermingled with massy clusters of grapes, into the\r\ndecorations of the churches built by them. The church of St. Remi, for\r\ninstance, commenced in the middle of the seventh century, and touched\r\nup by succeeding builders till it has been compared to a school of\r\nprogressive architecture, furnishes an example of this in the mouldings\r\nof its principal doorway; and Reims Cathedral offers several instances\r\nof a similar character.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE NORTH DOORWAY OF REIMS CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nAmidst the anarchy and confusion which marked the feeble sway of the\r\nlong-haired Merovingian kings, whom the warlike Franks were wont to\r\nhoist upon their bucklers when investing them with the sovereign power,\r\nwe find France relapsing into a state of barbarism; and though the\r\nSalic law enacted severe penalties for pulling up a vine-stock, the\r\nprospect of being liable at any moment to a writ of ejectment, enforced\r\nby the aid of a battle-axe, must have gone far to damp spontaneous\r\nardour as regards experimental viticulture. The tenants of the Church,\r\nin which category the bulk of the vine-growers of Reims and Epernay\r\nwere to be classed, were best off; but neither the threats of bishops\r\nnor the vengeance of saints could restrain acts of sacrilege and\r\npillage. During the latter half of the sixth century Reims, Epernay,\r\nand the surrounding district were ravaged several times by the\r\ncontending armies of Austrasia and Neustria; and Chilperic of Soissons,\r\non capturing the latter town in 562, put such heavy taxes on the vines\r\nand the serfs that in three years the inhabitants had deserted the\r\ncountry. Matters improved, however, during the more peaceful days of\r\nthe ensuing century, which witnessed the foundation of numerous abbeys,\r\nincluding those of Epernay, Hautvillers, and Avenay; and the planting\r\nof fresh vineyards in the ecclesiastical domains by Bishop Romulfe and\r\nhis successor St. Sonnace, the latter, who died in 637, bequeathing\r\nto the church of St. Remi a vineyard at Villers, and to the monastery\r\nof St. Pierre les Dames one situate at Germaine, in the Mountain of\r\nReims.[9] The sculptured saint on the exterior of Reims Cathedral, with\r\nhis feet resting upon a pedestal wreathed with vine-leaves and bunches\r\nof grapes, may possibly have been intended for one of these numerous\r\nwine-growing prelates.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE NORTH DOORWAY OF REIMS CATHEDRAL.]\r\n\r\nThe mighty figure of Charlemagne, overshadowing the whole of Europe\r\nat the commencement of the ninth century, appears in connection with\r\nReims, where, begirt with paladins and peers, he entertained the\r\nill-used Pope Leo III. right royally during the 'festes de Noel'\r\nof 805. The monarch who is said to have clothed the steep heights\r\nof Rudesheim with vines was not indifferent to good wine; and the\r\nvintages of the Champagne doubtless mantled in the magic goblet\r\nof Huon de Bordeaux, and brimmed the horns which Roland, Oliver,\r\nDoolin de Mayence, Renaud of Montauban, and Ogier the Dane, drained\r\nbefore girding on their swords and starting on their deeds of high\r\nemprise--the slaughter of Saracens, the rescue of captive damsels, and\r\nthe discomfiture of felon knights--told in the fables of Turpin and the\r\n'chansons de geste.' That the cultivation of the grape, and above all\r\nthe making of wine, had been steadily progressing, is clear from the\r\nfact that the distinction between the 'Vins de la Rivière de Marne' and\r\nthe 'Vins de la Montagne de Reims' dates from the ninth century.[10]\r\n\r\nThis era is, moreover, marked by the inauguration of that long series\r\nof coronations which helped to spread the popularity of the Champagne\r\nwines throughout France by the agency of the nobles and prelates taking\r\npart in the ceremony. Sumptuous festivities marked the coronation of\r\nCharlemagne's son Louis in 816; and the officiating Archbishop Ebbon\r\nmay have helped to furnish the feast with some of the produce from\r\nthe vineyard he had planted at Mont Ebbon, generally identified with\r\nthe existing Montebon, near Mardeuil. It is of this vineyard that\r\nPardulus, Bishop of Laon, speaks in a letter addressed by him to\r\nEbbon's successor, the virtuous Hincmar, who assumed the crozier in\r\n845, proffering him counsels as to the best method of sustaining his\r\nfailing health. After telling him to avoid eating fish on the same day\r\nthat it is caught, insisting that salted meat is more wholesome than\r\nfresh, and recommending bacon and beans cooked in fat as an excellent\r\ndigestive, he proceeds: 'You must make use of a wine which is neither\r\ntoo strong nor too weak--prefer, to those produced on the summit of the\r\nmountain or the bottom of the valley, one that is grown on the slopes\r\nof the hills, as towards Epernay, at Mont Ebbon; towards Chaumuzy, at\r\nRouvesy; towards Reims, at Mersy and Chaumery.' The Champagne vineyards\r\nsuffered grievously from the internal convulsions which marked the\r\nperiod when the sceptre of France was swayed by the feeble hands of\r\nthe dregs of the Carlovingian race. The Normans, who threatened Reims\r\nand sacked Epernay in 882, swept over them like devouring locusts; and\r\ntheir annals during the following century are written in letters of\r\nblood and flame.\r\n\r\nTimes were indeed bad for the peaceful vine-dressers in the tenth\r\ncentury, when castles were springing up in every direction; when might\r\nmade right, and the rule of the strong hand alone prevailed; and when\r\nthe firm belief that the end of the world was to come in the year\r\n1000 led men to live only for the present, and seek to get as much\r\nout of their fellow-creatures as they possibly could. Such natural\r\ncalamities as that of 919, when the wine-crop entirely failed in the\r\nneighbourhood of Reims, were bad enough; but the continual incursions\r\nof the Hungarians, whose arrows struck down the peasant at the plough\r\nand the priest at the altar, and the memory of whose pitiless deeds\r\nyet survives in the term 'ogre;' the desperate contest waged for ten\r\nyears by Heribert of Vermandois to secure the bishopric of Reims for\r\nhis infant son, during which hardly a foot of the disputed territory\r\nremained unstained by blood; the repeated invasions of Otho of Germany;\r\nand the struggle between Hugh Capet and Charles of Lorraine for the\r\ntitular crown of France,--left traces harder to be effaced. Reims\r\nunderwent four sieges in about sixty years; and Epernay, that most\r\nhapless of towns, was sacked at least half a score of times, and twice\r\nburnt, one of the most conscientiously executed pillagings being that\r\nperformed in 947 by Hugh the Great, who, as it was vintage-time,\r\ncompletely ravaged the whole country, and carried off all the wine.[11]\r\n\r\nUnder the rule of the Capetian race matters improved as regarded\r\nforeign foes, though the archbishops had in the early part of the\r\neleventh century to abandon Epernay, Vertus, Fismes, and their\r\ndependencies to the family of Robert of Vermandois, who had assumed the\r\ntitle of Counts of Champagne, to be held by them as fiefs. The fame\r\nof the schools of Reims, where future popes and embryo emperors met\r\nas class-mates; the festive gatherings which marked the coronation of\r\nHenry I. and Philip I.; the great ecclesiastical council held by Leo\r\nIX., which procured for the city the nickname of 'little Rome;' and the\r\ngrowing importance of the Champagne fairs, the great meeting-places\r\nthroughout the Middle Ages of the merchants of Spain, Italy, and\r\nthe Low Countries,--favoured the prosperity of the district and the\r\nproduction of its wine. Urban II., a native of Châtillon, who wore\r\nthe triple crown from 1088 to the close of the century, was, prior\r\nto his elevation to the chair of St. Peter, a canon of Reims, under\r\nthe name of Eudes or Odo, and, tippling there in company with his\r\nfellow-clerics, acquired a taste for the wine of Ay, which he preferred\r\nto all others in the world.[12] Pilgrims to Rome found penance light\r\nand pardon easily obtained when they bore with them across the Alps, in\r\naddition to staff and scrip, a huge 'leathern bottel' of that beloved\r\nvintage which warmed the pontiff's heart and whetted his wit for the\r\ndelivery of those soul-stirring orations at Placentia and Clermont,\r\nwherein he appealed to the chivalry of Western Europe to hasten to the\r\nrescue of the Holy Sepulchre from the hands of the infidel.\r\n\r\nThe result of these appeals was felt by the vine-cultivators of the\r\nChampagne in more ways than one, and their case recalls that of the\r\npetard-hoisted engineer. The virtuous, the speculative, and the\r\nenthusiastic who followed Peter the Hermit and Walter the Penniless\r\nto the plains of Asia Minor suffered at the hands of the vicious, the\r\nprudent, and the practical, who remained at home and passed their time\r\nin pillaging the estates of their absent neighbours. The abbatial\r\nvineyards suffered like the others; and the monks of St. Thierry,\r\nin making peace with Gerard de la Roche and Alberic Malet in 1138,\r\ncomplained bitterly of wine violently extorted during two years from\r\ngrowers on the ecclesiastical estate and of a levy made upon their\r\nvineyard.[13]\r\n\r\nThe efforts of Henry of France, a warlike prelate, who built fortresses\r\nand attacked those of the robber-nobles, and of Louis VII., who avenged\r\nthe wrongs of the church of Reims on the Counts of Roucy, served to\r\nimprove matters; and we may be sure that whenever the monks did get\r\nhold of a repentant or dying sinner, they made him pay pretty dearly\r\nfor peace with them and Heaven. Colin Musset, the early Champenois\r\npoet, thought that the best use to which money could be put was to\r\nspend it in good wine.[14] Churchmen, however, managed to secure the\r\ndesired commodity without any such outlay, for numerous charters of the\r\ntwelfth and thirteenth centuries show lords, sick or about starting\r\nfor the crusades, making large gifts to abbeys and monasteries; and\r\nmany a strip of fair and fertile vineland was thus added, thanks to\r\na judicious pressure on the conscience, to the already extensive\r\npossessions of the two great monasteries of Reims, St. Remi and St.\r\nNicaise, and also to that of St. Thierry. The Templars, too, whose\r\nreputation as wine-bibbers was only inferior to that of the monks, if\r\nwe may credit the adage which runs,\r\n\r\n    'Boire en templier, c'est boire à plein gosier;\r\n    Boire en cordelier, c'est vuider le cellier,'\r\n\r\nand who, prior to the catastrophe of 1313, had a commandery at Reims,\r\npossessed either vineyards, or _droits de vinage_, at numerous spots,\r\nincluding Epernay, Hermonville, Ludes, and Verzy; while the separate\r\ncommunity of these 'Red Monks' installed at Orilly had estates at\r\nAy, Damery, and Mareuil. The hospital of St. Mary at Reims also\r\nreckoned amongst its possessions vineyards at Moussy, bequeathed by\r\nCanon Pontius and Tebaldus Papelenticus. The wine, which in 1215 the\r\ntreasurer of the chapter of Reims Cathedral obtained from that body\r\nan acknowledgment of his right to on the anniversaries of the deaths\r\nof Bishops Ebalus and Radulf, and that to which the sub-treasurer and\r\ncarpenter were severally entitled, was no doubt in part derived from\r\nthe vineyard planted in 1206 by Canon Giles at the Porte Mars and\r\nbequeathed by him to the chapter, and the one which Canon John de Brie\r\nhad purchased at Mareuil and had similarly bequeathed.[15] Although\r\npapal bulls and archiepiscopal warrants had forbidden the levying of\r\nthe _droit de vinage_ on wine vintaged by religious communities, in\r\n1252 Pope Innocent IV. had to reprove the barons for interfering with\r\nthe monastic vintages in the neighbourhood of Reims, and to threaten\r\nthem with excommunication if they repeated their offence.[16]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINE-DRESSERS--THIRTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n(From a window of Chartres Cathedral).]\r\n\r\nThese ecclesiastical topers, as a rule, were sufficiently critical\r\nof the quality of the liquor meted out to them, and an agreement\r\nrespecting the dietary of the Abbey of St. Remi, at Reims, drawn up in\r\n1218 between the Abbot Peter and a deputation of six monks representing\r\nthe rest of the brethren, provides that the wine procured for the\r\nlatter should be improved by two-thirds of the produce of the Clos de\r\nMarigny being set apart for their exclusive use. Ten years later, to\r\nput a stop to further complaints on the part of these worthy rivals of\r\nRabelais' Frère Jean des Entonnoirs, Abbot Peter was fain to agree that\r\ntwo hundred hogsheads of wine should be annually brought from Marigny\r\nto the abbey to quench the thirst of his droughty flock, and that if\r\nthe spot in question failed to yield the required amount the deficiency\r\nshould be made up from his own private and particular vineyards at\r\nSacy, Villers-Aleran, Chigny, and Hermonville.[17]\r\n\r\nWe can readily picture these\r\n\r\n                      'jolly fat friars\r\n    Sitting round the great roaring fires\r\n    With their strong wines;'\r\n\r\nor the cellarer quietly chuckling to himself as he loosened the spiggot\r\nof the choicest casks--\r\n\r\n    'Between this cask and the abbot's lips\r\n    Many have been the sips and slips;\r\n    Many have been the draughts of wine,\r\n    On their way to his, that have stopped at mine.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATEWAY OF THE CHAPTER COURT AT REIMS.]\r\n\r\nThe monks were in the habit of throwing open their monasteries to all\r\ncomers, under pretext of letting them taste the wine they had for sale,\r\nuntil, in 1233, an ecclesiastical council at Beziers prohibited this\r\npractice on account of the scandal it created. Petrarch has accused\r\nthe popes of his day of persisting in staying at Avignon when they\r\ncould have returned to Rome, simply on account of the goodness of\r\nthe wines they found there. Some similar reasons may have led to the\r\nselection of Reims, during the twelfth century, as a place for holding\r\ngreat ecclesiastical councils presided over by the sovereign pontiff\r\nin person; and no doubt 'Bibimus papaliter' was the motto of Calixtus,\r\nInnocent, and Eugenius when the labours of the day were done, and they\r\nand their cardinals could chorus, _apropos_ of those of the morrow,\r\n\r\n    'Bonum vinum acuit ingenium\r\n        Venite potemus.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe kings of France may have preferred the wines of the Orleanais and\r\nthe Isle of France, and the monarchs of England have been content to\r\nvary the vintages of their patrimony of Guienne with an occasional\r\ndraught of Rhenish; but the wines of the river Marne certainly found\r\nfavour at Troyes, where the Counts of Champagne, to whom Epernay had\r\nbeen ceded as a fief, held a court little inferior in state to that\r\nof a sovereign prince. The native vintage mantled in the goblets and\r\nbeakers that graced the board where they sat at meat amidst their\r\nknights and barons, whilst minstrels sang and jongleurs tumbled\r\nand glee-maidens danced at the lower end of the hall. It fired the\r\nfancy of the poet Count Thibault, to whom tradition has ascribed the\r\nintroduction of the Cyprus grape into France on his return from the\r\nCrusades,[18] and helped the flow of the amorous strains which he\r\naddressed to Blanche of Castille. Nor was he the only versifier of the\r\ntime who could exclaim, with his compatriot Colin Musset, that 'good\r\nwine caused him to sing and rejoice.'[19] Other local songsters, such\r\nas Doete de Troyes, Eustache le Noble, and Guillaume de Machault,\r\nsought inspiration at their native Helicon, and were equally ready with\r\nColin Musset to appreciate a gift of\r\n\r\n                'barrelled wine,\r\n    Cold, strong, and fine,\r\n    To drink in hot weather,'[20]\r\n\r\nin return for their rhymes. It was this wine that the gigantic\r\nJohn Lord of Joinville, Seneschal of Champagne under Thibault, and\r\nchronicler of the Seventh Crusade, was in the habit of consuming warm\r\nand undiluted, by the advice of his physicians, on account, as he\r\nhimself mentions, of his 'large head and cold stomach;' a practice\r\nwhich seems to have scandalised that pious and ascetic monarch St.\r\nLouis, who was careful to temper his own potations with water. The\r\nking was most likely not unacquainted with the wine, as a roll of the\r\nexpenses incurred at his coronation at Reims, in 1226, shows that 991\r\nlivres were spent in wine on that occasion, when, in consequence of the\r\nvacancy of the archiepiscopal see, the crown was placed upon his head\r\nby Jacques de Bazoche, Bishop of Soissons.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nHenry of Andelys, a compatriot of the engineer Brunel, who flourished,\r\nif a poet can be said to flourish, in the latter half of the thirteenth\r\ncentury, has extolled the wines of Epernay and Hautvillers, and\r\nmentioned that of Reims, in his poem entitled the 'Bataille des Vins.'\r\nHe informs us at the outset that 'the great King Philip Augustus,' whom\r\nstate records prove to have had a score of vineyards in different parts\r\nof France,[21] was very fond of 'good white wine.' Anxious to make a\r\nchoice of the best, he issued invitations to all the most renowned\r\n_crûs_, French and foreign, and forty-six different vintages responded\r\nto this appeal; amongst them Hautvillers and Epernay, described as\r\n'vin d'Auviler' and 'vin d'Espernai le Bacheler.' The king's chaplain,\r\nan English priest, makes a preliminary examination, resulting in\r\nthe summary rejection of many competitors, till at length, as\r\nArgenteuil--'clear as oil'--and Pierrefitte are disputing as to their\r\nrespective merits, Epernay and Hautvillers simultaneously exclaim,\r\n'Argenteuil, thou wishest to degrade all the wines at this table. By\r\nGod, thou playest too much the part of constable. We excel Châlons and\r\nReims, remove gout from the loins, and support all kings.'[22] But\r\nlo, up jumps the 'vin d'Ausois,' the 'Osey' of so many of our English\r\nmediæval poets, with the reproach, 'Epernay, thou art too disloyal;\r\nthou hast not the right of speaking in court;'[23] and enumerates\r\nthe blessings which he and his demoiselle 'la Mosele' confer upon\r\nthe Germans.[24] La Rochelle in turn reproves Ausois, and extols the\r\nstrength of his own wines, and those of Angoulême, Bordeaux, Saintes,\r\nand Poitou, and boasts of the welcome accorded to them in the northern\r\nstates of Europe, including England, to which the districts he mentions\r\nthen belonged.[25]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINTAGERS OF THE THIRTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n(From a /MS./ of the Dialogues de St. Grégoire).]\r\n\r\nThe vintages of the then little kingdom of France put in a\r\ncounter-claim for finesse and flavour as opposed to strength, and\r\nmaintain that they do not harm those who drink them. The dispute\r\nbecomes general, and the wines, heated with argument, exhale a perfume\r\nof 'balsam and amber,' till the hall where they are met resembles a\r\nterrestial paradise. The chaplain, after conscientiously tasting the\r\nwhole of them, formally excommunicated with bell, book, and candle all\r\nthe beer brewed in England and Flanders, and then went incontinently to\r\nbed, and slept for three days and three nights without intermission.\r\nThe king thereupon made an examination himself, and named the wine\r\nof Cyprus pope, and that of Aquilat[26] cardinal, and created of the\r\nremainder three kings, five counts, and twelve peers, the names of\r\nwhich, unfortunately, have not been preserved.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n        /The Wines of the Champagne from the Fourteenth to the\r\n                         Seventeenth Century./\r\n\r\n    Coronations at Reims and their attendant banquets--Wine\r\n    flows profusely at these entertainments--The wine-trade of\r\n    Reims--Presents of wine from the Reims municipality--Cultivation\r\n    of the vineyards abandoned after the battle of Poitiers--Octroi\r\n    levied on wine at Reims--Coronation of Charles V.--Extension\r\n    of the Champagne vineyards--Abundance of wine--Visit to Reims\r\n    of the royal sot Wenceslaus of Bohemia--The Etape aux Vins at\r\n    Reims--Increased consumption of beer during the English occupation\r\n    of the city--The Maid of Orleans at Reims--The vineyards and\r\n    wine-trade alike suffer--Louis XI. is crowned at Reims--Fresh\r\n    taxes upon wine followed by the Mique-Maque revolt--The Rémois\r\n    the victims of pillaging foes and extortionate defenders--The\r\n    Champagne vineyards attacked by noxious insects--Coronation of\r\n    Louis XII.--François Premier, the Emperor Charles V., Bluff King\r\n    Hal, and Leo the Magnificent all partial to the wine of Ay--Mary\r\n    Queen of Scots at Reims--State kept by the opulent and libertine\r\n    Cardinal of Lorraine--Brusquet, the Court Fool--Decrease in the\r\n    production of wine around Reims--Gifts of wine to newly-crowned\r\n    monarchs--New restrictions on vine cultivation--The wine of the\r\n    Champagne crowned at the same time as Louis XIII.--Regulation price\r\n    for wine established at Reims--Imposts levied on the vineyards by\r\n    the Frondeurs--The country ravaged around Reims--Sufferings of the\r\n    peasantry--Presents of wine to Marshal Turenne and Charles II. of\r\n    England--Perfection of the Champagne wines during the reign of\r\n    Louis XIV.--St. Evremond's high opinion of them--Other contemporary\r\n    testimony in their favour--The Archbishop of Reims's niggardly gift\r\n    to James II. of England--A poet killed by Champagne--Offerings by\r\n    the Rémois to Louis XIV. on his visit to their city.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe coronations at Reims served, as already remarked, to attract within\r\nthe walls of the old episcopal city all that was great, magnificent,\r\nand noble in France. The newly-crowned king, with that extensive\r\nretinue which marked the monarch of the Middle Ages; the great vassals\r\nof the crown scarcely less profusely attended; the constable, the\r\nsecular and ecclesiastical peers, and the host of knights and nobles\r\nwho assisted on the occasion, were wont at the conclusion of the\r\nceremony to hold high revelry in the spacious temporary banqueting-hall\r\nreared near the cathedral. It is to be regretted that the _menus_ of\r\nthese banquets have not been handed down to us in their entirety; but\r\na few fragmentary excerpts show that from a comparatively early period\r\nthere was no lack of wine, at any rate. A remonstrance addressed to\r\nPhilip the Fair, after his coronation in 1286, by the archbishop and\r\nburghers, asks that they may be relieved of a certain proportion of the\r\nsum levied on them for the cost of the ceremony, on the ground that\r\nthere still remained over for the king's use no less than seven score\r\ntuns of wine from the banquet. Some idea may be formed of the quantity\r\nof wine brought regularly into the city from the circumstance of the\r\nking having Reims surrounded by walls in 1294, and levying a duty on\r\nthe wine imported to pay for them, and by the value attached to the\r\n'rouage'[27] of the Mairie St. Martin, claimed by the chapter of Reims\r\nCathedral in 1300.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REIMS CATHEDRAL, WEST FRONT.]\r\n\r\nAt the coronation of Charles IV., in 1322, wine flowed in rivers.\r\nAmongst the unconsumed provisions returned by the king's pantler,\r\nPelvau dou Val, to the burghers, 'vin de Biaune et de Rivière'--that\r\nis, of Beaune and of the Marne--figures for a value of 384 livres\r\n5 sols 2 deniers.[28] The arrangements of the coronation had been\r\nintrusted to the minister of finances, Pierre Remi, who certainly\r\nplayed the part of the unjust steward. In the first place, he made\r\nthe cost of the ceremony amount to 21,000 livres, whereas none of his\r\npredecessors had spent more than 7,000 livres. His opening move had\r\nbeen to seize upon the greater part of the corn and all the ovens in\r\nReims 'for the king's use,' and to sell bread to the townsfolk and\r\nvisitors at his own price for a fortnight prior to the coronation.\r\nAfter the ceremony he appropriated in like manner all the plate and\r\nnapery, and all the cooking utensils and kitchen furniture, together\r\nwith whatever had been left over, in the shape of wine, wax, fish,\r\nbullocks, pigs, and similar trifles. The wine thus taken was estimated\r\nat 1500 livres, part of which he sold to two bourgeois of Reims, and\r\nkept the rest, together with forty-four out of the fifty muids, or\r\nhogsheads, of salt provided.[29] Retributive justice overtook him, for\r\nthe chronicler of his ill-doings chuckles over the fact that he was\r\nhanged as high as Haman on a gibbet he had himself erected at Paris.\r\nThings went off better at the coronation of King Philip, in 1328, when\r\nthe total amount expended in the three hundred poinçons of the wine of\r\nBeaune, St. Pourçain, and the Marne consumed was 1675 livres 2 sols 3\r\ndeniers.[30] Part of this flowed through the mouth of the great bronze\r\nstag before which criminals condemned by the archiepiscopal court used\r\nto be exposed, but which at coronation times was placed in the Parvis\r\nNotre Dame, and spouted forth the 'claré dou cerf,' for the preparation\r\nof which the town records show that the grocer O. la Lale received 16\r\nlivres.[31]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe importance of the wine-trade of Reims at the commencement of the\r\nfourteenth century is evidenced by the fact of there being at this\r\nepoch _courtiers de vin_, or wine-brokers, the right of appointing\r\nwhom rested with the eschevins--a right which, vainly assailed by the\r\narchbishop in 1323, was confirmed to the municipal power by several\r\nroyal decrees.[32] The burghers of Reims were fully cognisant of the\r\nmerits of their wine, and certainly spared no trouble to make others\r\nacquainted with them. When the eschevins dined with the archbishop in\r\nAugust 1340 they contributed thirty-two pots of wine as their share\r\nof the repast, in addition to sundry partridges, capons, and rabbits.\r\nAll visitors to the town on business, and all persons of distinction\r\npassing through it, were regaled with an offering of from two to four\r\ngallons from the cellars of Jehan de la Lobe, or Petit Jehannin, or\r\nRaulin d'Escry, or Baudouin le Boutellier, or Remi Cauchois, the\r\nprincipal tavern-keepers. The provost of Laon, the bailli and the\r\nreceveur of Vermandois, the eschevins of Châlons, the Bishop of\r\nCoustances, Monseigneur Thibaut de Bar, Monseigneur Jacques la Vache\r\n(the queen's physician), the Archdeacon of Reims, and the 'two lords\r\nof the parliament deputed by the king to examine the walls,' were a\r\nfew of the recipients of this hospitality, which was also extended to\r\nsuch inferior personages as a varlet of Verdun and the varlet of the\r\neschevins of Abbeville.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE BATTLE OF CRÉCY\r\n\r\n(From a /MS./ of Froissart's Chronicles).]\r\n\r\nTwo 'flasks,' purchased for threepence-halfpenny from Petit Jehannin,\r\nserved to warm the eloquence of Maistre Baudouin de Loingnis when he\r\npleaded for the town on the subject of the fortifications in 1345; and\r\nwhen, in 1340, the Archbishop of Narbonne, the Bishop of Poitiers,\r\nand sundry other dignitaries passed through Reims with heavy hearts\r\non their way to St. Omer, to negotiate a truce with Edward of England\r\nafter the fatal battle of Sluys, the municipality expended five\r\nshillings and threepence in a poinçon of wine to cheer them on their\r\nway. There was probably plenty to spare, since on the outbreak of\r\nhostilities with England the town-crier had received one penny for\r\nmaking proclamation that no one should remove any wine from the town\r\nduring the continuance of the contest. The advent of a messenger of\r\nMonseigneur Guillaume Pinson, who brought 'closed letters' to the\r\neschevins informing them of the invasion of King Edward, does not\r\nseem to have spoilt the digestion of those worthy gentlemen, since\r\nthey partook of their annual gift of wine and their presentation lamb\r\nat Easter 1346; but there were sore hearts in the old city when one\r\nJenvier returned from Amiens with the tidings that their best and\r\nbravest had fallen under the banner of John de Vienne, their warlike\r\nprelate, on the field of Crécy. Perhaps to the state of depression\r\nthat followed is due the fact that there are no records of festivities\r\nat the coronation of King John the Good in 1350, though we find the\r\ncitizens seeking two years later to propitiate the evil genius of\r\nFrance, Charles the Bad of Navarre, by the gift of a queue of wine\r\ncosting five crowns.\r\n\r\nDuring the frightful anarchy prevailing after the battle of Poitiers,\r\nwhen the victorious English and the disbanded forces of France made\r\ncommon cause against the hapless peasants, the fields and vineyards\r\nof Reims remained uncultivated for three years,[33] and the people of\r\nthe archbishopric would have perished of hunger had they not been able\r\nto get food and wine from Hainault. Despite the prohibitions of the\r\nregent, the nobles pillaged the country around Reims and ravaged the\r\nvineyards from June to August 1358, and the havoc they wrought exceeded\r\neven that accomplished during the Jacquerie. Nor were matters improved\r\nby the advent of the English king, Edward III., when, on the wet St.\r\nAndrew's-day of 1359, he sat down before the town with his host, which\r\nstarved and shivered throughout the bitter and tempestuous winter,\r\ndespite the comfort derived from the 'three thousand vessels of wine'\r\ncaptured by Eustace Dabreticourt in 'the town of Achery, on the river\r\nof Esne.'[34] But the Rémois stood firm behind the fortifications\r\nreared by Gaucher de Châtillon till the following spring, when the\r\nvictor of Crécy drew off his baffled forces, consoling them with the\r\npromise of bringing them back during the ensuing vintage, and made a\r\nreluctant peace at Bretigny.[35]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT TOWER BELONGING TO THE FORTIFICATIONS OF REIMS.]\r\n\r\nYet, though plague and famine in turn almost depopulated the city, the\r\nimportance of its vineyards augmented from this time forward. In 1361\r\nthe citizens, who had already been in the habit of granting 'aides'\r\nto the king out of the dues levied on the wine sold in the town,\r\nobtained leave to impose an _octroi_ on wine, in order to maintain\r\ntheir fortifications. Henceforward the connection between the wines\r\nand the walls of Reims became permanent. The _octroi_ was from time to\r\ntime renewed or modified in various ways by different monarchs; but\r\ntheir decrees always commenced with a preliminary flourish concerning\r\nthe necessity of keeping the walls of so important a city in good\r\norder, and the admirable opportunity afforded of so doing by the\r\never-increasing prosperity of the trade in wine. Conspicuous amongst\r\nthe few existing fragments of the circuit of walls and towers with\r\nwhich Reims was formerly begirt is the tower of which a view is here\r\ngiven.[36]\r\n\r\nThe Rémois, although willing enough to tax themselves for the defence\r\nof their city, submitted the reverse of cheerfully to the preliminary\r\nlevies of provisions, wines, meats, and other things necessary, made by\r\nthe king's 'maistres d'hôtel' for the coronation of Charles V., which\r\ntook place on the 19th May 1364, at a cost to the town of 7712 livres\r\n15 sols 5 deniers parisis.[37] The citizens had, however, something to\r\ngaze at for their money, if that were any consolation. The king and his\r\nqueen (Jeanne de Bourbon) were accompanied by King Peter of Cyprus;\r\nWenceslaus, King of Bohemia and Duke of Brabant; the Dukes of Burgundy\r\nand Anjou; the Counts of Eu, Dampmartin, Tancarville, and Vaudemont,\r\nand many other prelates and lords, who did full justice to the good\r\ncheer provided for the great feasts and solemnities taking place during\r\nthe five days of the royal sojourn.[38] The crown, borne by Philip\r\nof Burgundy, the king's youngest brother, having been placed upon\r\nCharles's head by the Archbishop Jean de Craon, that prelate proceeded\r\nto smear the royal breast and brow with what the irreverent Republicans\r\nof the eighteenth century designated 'sacred pomatum,' from the Sainte\r\nAmpoule presented to him by the Bishop of Laon, amidst the enthusiastic\r\napplause of nobles and prelates.[39]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORONATION OF CHARLES V. AT REIMS\r\n\r\n(From a /MS./ Histoire de Charles V.).]\r\n\r\nThe great planting of vines in the Champagne district plainly dates\r\nfrom the last quarter of the fourteenth century, at which epoch\r\nlarge exports of wine to the provinces of Hainault and Flanders, and\r\nespecially to the ports of Sluys, are noted. In a list of the revenues\r\nof the archbishopric of Reims, drawn up by Richard Pique towards\r\n1375, are included patches of vineland and annual payments of wine\r\nfrom almost every village and hamlet within twenty miles of Reims;\r\nthough it is only fair to mention that many of the places enumerated\r\nproduce to-day wines of very ordinary character, which, although they\r\nhave a local habitation, have certainly failed to secure themselves a\r\nname.[40] A general return of church property made to the Bailli of\r\nVermandois, the king's representative in 1384, at a time when Charles\r\nVI. was busily engaged in confiscating whatever he could lay hands on,\r\nshows that the religious establishments of Reims were equally well\r\nendowed with vineyards. These were mostly situate to the north-east\r\nand south-west of Reims, or in the immediate vicinity of the city;\r\nand according to their owners, whose object was of course to offer\r\nas few temptations as possible to the monarch, they frequently cost\r\nmore to dress than they brought in.[41] In the return furnished by the\r\narchbishop in the following year, he complains that, owing to the great\r\nplantation of vines throughout the district, the right of licensing the\r\nbrewing of ale and beer had failed to bring him in any revenue for the\r\npast three years. This prelate, by the way, seems to have loved his\r\nliquor like many of his predecessors, judging from the inventory made\r\nafter his death, in 1389, of the contents of his cellars.[42] All this\r\nabundance of wine was not without its fruits; and we find the clerk\r\nof Troyes asserting that liars swarm in Picardy as drunkards do in\r\nChampagne, where a man not worth a rap will drink wine every day;[43]\r\nand a boast in the chanson of the Comte de Brie to the effect that the\r\nprovince abounded in wheat, wine, fodder, and litter.[44]\r\n\r\nUnder these circumstances it is not at all surprising that that\r\nrenowned vinous soaker, King Wenceslaus (surnamed the Drunkard) of\r\nBohemia, found ample opportunities for self-indulgence when he visited\r\nReims to confer with Charles VI. on the subject of the schism of the\r\npopes of Avignon, then desolating the Church--certainly a very fit\r\nsubject for a drunkard and a madman to put their heads together about.\r\nNo sooner had the illustrious visitor alighted at the Abbey of St.\r\nRemi--to-day the Hôtel Dieu--where quarters had been assigned him, than\r\nhe expressed a wish to taste the wine of the district, with the quality\r\nof which he had long been acquainted. The wine was brought, and tasted\r\nagain and again in such conscientious style that when the Dukes of\r\nBourbon and Berri came to escort him to dinner with the king they found\r\nhim dead-drunk and utterly unfit to treat of affairs of State, still\r\nless those of the Church. The same kind of thing went on daily--the\r\n'same old drunk,' as the nigger expressed it, lasting week after week;\r\nand the French monarch, who must have surely had a lucid interval,\r\nresolved to profit by his guest's weakness. Accordingly he gave special\r\norders to the cup-bearers, at a grand banquet at which matters were\r\nto be finally settled, to be particularly attentive in filling the\r\nBohemian king's goblet. This they did so frequently that the royal sot,\r\novercome by wine, yielded during the discussion following the repast\r\nwhatever was asked of him; whilst his host probably returned special\r\nthanks to St. Archideclin, the supposed bridegroom of the marriage of\r\nCana, whom the piety of the Middle Ages had transformed into a saint\r\nand created the especial patron of all appertaining to the cellar. This\r\ntriumph of wine over diplomacy occurred in 1397.[45]\r\n\r\nA charter of Charles VI., dated July 1412, which gave the municipal\r\nauthorities of Reims the sole right of appointing sworn wine-brokers,\r\nexpressly mentions that the trade of the town was chiefly based upon\r\nthe wine grown in the environs.[46] The wine, the charter states, when\r\nstored in the cellars of the town, was customarily sold by brokers,\r\nwho of their own authority were in the habit of levying a commission\r\nof twopence, and even more, per piece, selling it to the person who\r\noffered them most, and taking money from both buyer and seller. To\r\nremedy this state of things, from which it was asserted the trade had\r\nbegun to suffer, it was decreed that every broker should take an oath,\r\nbefore the Captain of Reims and the eschevins, to act honestly and\r\nwithout favour, and not to receive more than one penny commission. In\r\nthe case of his receiving more, both he and the seller of the wine were\r\nto forfeit two-pence-halfpenny to the town.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHURCH OF ST. REMI, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nThe sales of wine mainly took place at the Etape aux Vins, where most\r\nof the wine-merchants were established, the busiest time being during\r\nthe three great annual fairs, when no duties were levied. The old\r\nEtape aux Vins is now the Rue de l'Etape, jocularly styled the Rue de\r\nRivoli of Reims, on account of the arcades formed by the projecting\r\nupper floors of its fifteenth-and sixteenth-century houses, which rest\r\nupon wooden and stone pillars. To-day the casino and the principal\r\nrestaurants of the city are installed here; still the locality retains\r\nmuch the same aspect as it presented in the days when Remi Cauchois\r\nand Huet Hurtaut stood here and chaffered with the peasants who had\r\nbrought their casks of wine on creaking wains into the city; when S. de\r\nLaval glided in search of a customer among the long-gowned fur-capped\r\nmerchants of the Low Countries; when bargains were closed by a\r\nGod's-penny and wetted with a stoup of Petit Jehannin's best; and when\r\nfiles of wine-laden wagons rolled forth from the northern gates of the\r\ncity to gladden the thirsty souls of Hainault and Flanders.\r\n\r\nSome of the wine had, however, a nobler destination. An order of\r\npayment addressed by the town council to the receiver, and dated March\r\n23, 1419, commands him to pay Jacques le Vigneron the sum of 78 livres\r\n12 sols for six queues of 'vin blanc et clairet,' presented to the\r\nfierce Duke of Burgundy, Jean sans Peur, at the high price of about\r\n11_s._ each.[47] Nor did his son Philip, the self-styled 'Prince of the\r\nbest wines in Christendom,' disdain to draw bridle in order to receive\r\neleven poinçons of 'vin claret' when hastening,\r\n\r\n    'Bloody with spurring, fiery red with speed,'\r\n\r\nthrough Reims to avenge his father's murder at the Bridge of\r\nMontereau.[48] The devastating results of the terrible struggle for\r\nsupremacy waged between the Armagnacs and Burgundians, and of the\r\ninvasion of Henry V. of England, are evidenced in the facts that when,\r\nin fear and trembling, the Reims council resolved to allow Duke Philip\r\nto enter the town in 1425, at the head of four thousand horse, they\r\ncould only offer him one queue of Beaune, one queue of red, and one\r\nqueue of white wine; and to the duchess the following year one queue of\r\nBeaune and one of French wine; and that wine sent to l'Isle Adam, at\r\nthe siege of Nesle, cost as much as 19 livres, or nearly 16_s._, the\r\nqueue.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RUE DE L'ETAPE, REIMS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nReims had passed under the sway of England by the Treaty of Troyes\r\nin 1420, the Earl of Salisbury becoming governor of the Champagne.\r\nThe scarcity of wine, and the liking of the new possessors for their\r\nnational beverage, is shown by a prohibition issued by the town council\r\nin 1427 against using wheat for making beer; and a statement of Gobin\r\nPersin, that he had sold more treacle--a famous medicinal remedy in the\r\nMiddle Ages--during the past half year than in the four years previous,\r\nowing to people complaining that they were swollen up from drinking\r\nmalt liquor. The English, however, at their abrupt departure from the\r\ncity on the arrival of Charles and the Maid of Orleans, proved their\r\npartiality for the wine of Reims by carrying off as many wagonloads of\r\nit as they could manage to lay their hands on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEANNE DARC'S FIRST INTERVIEW WITH CHARLES VII.\r\n\r\n(From a tapestry of the fifteenth century).]\r\n\r\nThe gallant knights and patriot nobles who followed the Maid of Orleans\r\nto Reims, and witnessed the coronation of Charles VII. in 1429,\r\ndespised, of course, the drink of their island foes, and moistened\r\nthroats grown hoarse with shouting 'Vive le roi' with the choice\r\nvintage of the neighbouring slopes, freely drawn forth from the most\r\nsecret recesses of the cellars of the town in honour of the glorious\r\nday. And no doubt Dame Alice, widow of Raulin Marieu, and hostess of\r\nthe Asne royé (the Striped Ass), put a pot of the very best before the\r\nfather of 'Jehane la Pucelle,' and did not forget, either, to score\r\nit down in the little bill of twenty-four livres which she was paid\r\nout of the _deniers communs_ for the old fellow's entertainment.[49]\r\nFor the next ten years, however, the note of war resounded through the\r\ncountry, the hill-sides bristled with lances in lieu of vine-stakes,\r\nand instead of money spent for wine for presentation to guests of a\r\npacific disposition, the archives of the town display a long list of\r\nsums expended in the purchase of arms, artillery, and ammunition, for\r\nthe especial accommodation of less pleasant visitors, in repairing\r\nfortifications, and in payments to men charged with watching day and\r\nnight for the coming of the foe.\r\n\r\nThe excesses of the licentious followers of Potton de Xaintrailles and\r\nLahire were worse than those of the English and Burgundians, spite of\r\nthe four hundred and five livres which had been paid to men-at-arms\r\nand archers from the neighbouring garrisons, 'engaged by the city of\r\nReims to guard the surrounding country, in order that the wine might be\r\nvintaged and brought into the said city and the vineyards dressed,'[50]\r\nand bitter were the complaints addressed in 1433 to the king on the\r\nfalling off of the wine trade which had resulted therefrom. The ravages\r\nof the terrible 'Escorcheurs' led, in 1436, to fresh complaints and\r\nto an additional duty on each queue of 'wine of Beaune, of the Marne,\r\nand of other foreign districts' sold wholesale at Reims, the receipts\r\nto be spent in warlike preparations and on the fortifications. Some of\r\nthis went to Lahire as a recompense for defending the district from\r\n'the great routs and companies' that sought to invade it, he having,\r\npresumably on the principle of setting a thief to catch a thief,\r\nbeen made Bailli of Vermandois. In troublous times like these it was\r\nnecessary to secure the good will of men in power and authority,\r\nand hence the town records comprise numerous offerings of money,\r\nfine linen cloths, and wine given to various nobles 'out of grace\r\nand courtesy' for their good will and 'good and agreeable services,\r\npleasures, and love.' Madame Katherine de France (the widow of Henry\r\nV.), the Chancellor of France, the Constable Richemont, Lahire (Bailli\r\nof Vermandois), the bastard Dunois, the Archbishop of Narbonne, the\r\nCount de Vendôme, and many other nobles and dignitaries, were in turn\r\nrecipients of such gifts; and the visit of King Charles the Victorious,\r\nin 1440, was celebrated by their profuse distribution.[51]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CULTIVATION OF THE VINE AND VINTAGING IN THE FIFTEENTH\r\nCENTURY\r\n\r\n(From a /MS./ of the Propriétaire des Choses).]\r\n\r\nDespite the complete expulsion of the English from France, a depression\r\nin trade still continued; and in 1451 the lieutenant of the town was\r\nsent to court to complain that, owing to the exactions of the farmers\r\nof the revenue, merchants would no longer come to Reims to buy wine.\r\nLouis XI., who was crowned at Reims on 15th August 1461, entered the\r\ncity in great pomp, accompanied by Philip, Duke of Burgundy, and his\r\nson the Count of Charolais, afterwards Charles the Bold; the Duke of\r\nBourbon, the Duke of Cleves, and his brother the Lord of Ravenstein,\r\nall three nephews of Duke Philip; the Counts of St. Pol, Angoulême,\r\nEu, Vendôme, Nassau, and Grandpré; Messire Philip of Savoy, and many\r\nothers,--'all so richly dressed that it was a noble sight to see,'\r\nremarks Enguerrand de Monstrelet. Prior to being crowned, the king\r\nhanded his sword to Duke Philip, and requested the latter to bestow\r\nupon him the honour of knighthood, which the duke did, and afterwards\r\ngave the accolade to several other persons of distinction. The\r\ncoronation, with its accompaniment of 'many beautiful mysteries and\r\nceremonies,' was performed by Archbishop Jean Juvénal des Ursins,\r\nassisted by the Cardinal of Constance, the Patriarch of Antioch, a\r\npapal legate, four archbishops, seventeen bishops, and six abbots. At\r\nits close the twelve peers of France[52] dined at the king's table; and\r\nafter the table was cleared the Duke of Burgundy knelt and did homage\r\nfor Burgundy, Flanders, and Artois, other lords following his example.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PEERS OF FRANCE PRESENT AT THE CORONATION OF LOUIS\r\nXI. AT REIMS\r\n\r\n(From painted-glass windows in Evreux Cathedral).]\r\n\r\nLouis XI., on his accession, found himself in presence of an exhausted\r\ntreasury, and cast about for an expedient to fill it. The wine\r\nhe drunk at his coronation at Reims may have suggested the dues\r\nwhich, only a month afterwards, he decreed should be levied on this\r\ncommodity, in conjunction with an impost on salt. The inhabitants\r\nof the archiepiscopal city found it impossible to believe in such a\r\nreturn for their wonted hospitality, and the vine-growers assailed the\r\ncollectors furiously. The affair resulted in a general outbreak, known\r\nas the Mique-Maque, and in the final hanging, branding, mutilating,\r\nand banishing of a number of individuals, half of whom, it may fairly\r\nbe presumed, were innocent. The wars between France and Burgundy were\r\nalso severely felt by the Rémois, whose territory was ravaged by the\r\nfollowers of Charles the Bold after Montlhery, and who suffered almost\r\nas much at the hands of their friends as at those of their foes. The\r\ngarrison put into the town shared amongst themselves the country for\r\na circuit of eight leagues, the meanest archer having a couple of\r\nvillages, whence he exacted, at pleasure, corn, wood, provisions, and\r\nwine, the latter in such profusion that the surplus was sold in the\r\nstreets, the smallest allowance for each lance being a queue, valued at\r\nten livres, monthly. In 1470 and the following years large subsidies of\r\nwine were, moreover, despatched from time to time to the king's army\r\nin the field; a cartload being judiciously sent to General Gaillard,\r\n'as he is well disposed towards us, and it is necessary to cultivate\r\nsuch people.' Complaints made in 1489 set forth that in consequence of\r\nthe _octroi_ of the river Aisne, which had been established six years\r\npreviously, the merchants of Liège, Mezières, and Rethel, instead\r\nof coming to Reims to buy wine, were obtaining their supplies from\r\nOrleans. The landing of Henry VII. of England, in 1495, spread new\r\nalarms throughout the Champagne, and orders were given for all the\r\nvine-stakes within a radius of two leagues of Reims to be pulled up, so\r\nthat the enemy might be prevented from cooking provisions or filling up\r\nthe moats of the fortifications with them.\r\n\r\nPillaging foes and extortionate defenders were bad enough, but the\r\nvine-growers had yet other enemies, to wit, certain noxious little\r\ninsects, which were in the habit of feeding on the young buds, though\r\nthere is no record that they were ever so troublesome at Reims as they\r\nwere in other parts of the Champagne, notably at Troyes, where on the\r\nFriday after Pentecost 1516 they were formally and solemnly enjoined\r\nby Maître Jean Milon to depart within six days from the vineyards of\r\nVillenauxe, under pain of anathema and malediction.[53] A century and a\r\nhalf later these insects renewed their ravages, and were exorcised anew\r\nby the rural dean of Sézanne, on the order of the Bishop of Troyes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CULTURE OF THE VINE--SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n(From a /MS./ Calendar).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TREADING GRAPES--SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n(From a /MS./ Calendar).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BUTLER OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n(Facsimile of a woodcut in the Cosmographie Universelle, 1549).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORONATION OF LOUIS XII. AT REIMS\r\n\r\n(From a painting on wood of the fifteenth century).]\r\n\r\nThe close of the fifteenth century witnessed another coronation, that\r\nof the so-styled 'Father of his People,' Louis XII., celebrated with\r\nall due splendour in May 1498. The six ecclesiastical peers--principal\r\namong whom was the Cardinal Archbishop of Reims, Guillaume Briconnet,\r\nin rochet and stole, mitre and crozier; and the six representatives\r\nof the secular peerages, Burgundy, Normandy, Aquitaine, Flanders,\r\nToulouse, and Champagne--solemnly invested their sovereign with sword,\r\nspurs, ring, orb, sceptre, crown, and all the other outward symbols\r\nof royalty; whilst the vaulted roof rang with the acclamations of\r\nthe people assembled in the nave, and the triumphant peals from the\r\nheralds' silver trumpets, on the banneroles of which was emblazoned the\r\nmonarch's favourite badge, the hedgehog. Trumpet-blowing and shouting\r\nbeing both provocative of thirst, peers and people did ample justice to\r\nthe wine freely provided for all comers on this occasion.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOORWAY IN THE ARCHIEPISCOPAL PALACE AT REIMS.]\r\n\r\nFrancis I. was crowned at Reims in January 1515; and on the occasion\r\nof his visiting the city sixteen years afterwards, twenty poinçons\r\nof wine were offered to him and sixty to his suite, so that this\r\nbibulous monarch had a good opportunity of comparing various growths\r\nof the Mountain and the River with the wine from his own vineyards\r\nat Ay; and possibly the Emperor Charles V. did his best to institute\r\nsimilar comparisons on his self-invited incursion into the district\r\nin 1544. For not only did these two great rivals, but also our own\r\nBluff King Harry and the magnificent Leo X., have each their special\r\ncommissioner stationed at Ay to secure for them the finest vintages of\r\nthat favoured spot, the renown of which thenceforward has never paled.\r\nThe wine despatched for their consumption was most likely sent direct\r\nfrom the vineyards in carefully-sealed casks; but the bulk of the river\r\ngrowths came to Reims for sale, and helped to swell the importance of\r\nthe town as an emporium of the wine-trade. When Mary Queen of Scots\r\ncame to Reims, a mere child, in 1550, four poinçons of good wine, with\r\na dozen peacocks and as many turkeys, were presented to her. There\r\nare no records, however, of any further offerings to her when, as\r\nthe widowed queen of Francis II., she visited Reims at Eastertide in\r\n1561, and again during the summer of the same year, shortly before her\r\nfinal departure from France. On these occasions she was the guest, by\r\nturns, of her aunt Renée de Lorraine, at the convent of St. Pierre les\r\nDames,--to-day a woollen factory,--and of her uncle, the 'opulent and\r\nlibertine' Charles de Lorraine, Cardinal and Archbishop of Reims, at\r\nthe handsome archiepiscopal palace, where this powerful prelate resided\r\nin unwonted state. As the rhyme goes--\r\n\r\n    'Bishop and abbot and prior were there,\r\n        Many a monk and many a friar,\r\n        Many a knight and many a squire,\r\n    With a great many more of lesser degree\r\n    Who served the Lord Primate on bended knee.\r\n          Never, I ween,\r\n          Was a prouder seen,\r\n    Read of in books, or dreamt of in dreams,\r\n    Than the Cardinal Lord Archbishop of Reims.'\r\n\r\nBrusquet, the court fool of Henry II., Francis II., and Charles IX.,\r\nwas a great favourite with this princely prelate, and accompanied him\r\nseveral times on his embassies to foreign states. Brusquet's wit was\r\nmuch appreciated by the cardinal, and has been highly extolled by\r\nBrantome; but most of the specimens handed down to us will not bear\r\nrepetition, much less translation, from their coarseness. When the\r\ncardinal was at Brussels in 1559, negotiating the peace of Cateau\r\nCambresis with Philip II., Brusquet one day at dessert jumped on to the\r\ntable, and rolled along the whole length, wrapping himself up like a\r\nmummy in the cloth, with all the knives, forks, and spoons, as he went,\r\nand rolling over at the further end. The emperor, Charles V., who was\r\nthe host, was so delighted that he told him to keep the plate himself.\r\nBrusquet had great dread of being drowned, and objected one day to\r\ngo in a boat with the cardinal. 'Do you think any harm can happen to\r\nyou with me, the pope's best friend?' said the latter. 'I know that\r\nthe pope has power over earth, heaven, and purgatory,' said Brusquet;\r\n'but I never heard that his dominion extended over water.' It is not\r\nunlikely that the effigy forming one of the corbels beneath the chapter\r\ncourt gateway, and representing a fool in the puffed and slashed shoes\r\nand bombasted hose of the Renaissance, with his bauble in his hand, may\r\nbe intended for Brusquet; for in the Middle Ages the ecclesiastical\r\ncouncils had forbidden dignitaries of the Church to have fools of their\r\nown.[54]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHIMNEYPIECE IN THE BANQUETING HALL OF THE\r\nARCHIEPISCOPAL PALACE AT REIMS.]\r\n\r\nIt was in the grand hall of the archiepiscopal palace of Reims--an\r\napartment which is very little changed from the days when Charles\r\nCardinal de Lorraine entertained Henry II., Francis II., and Charles\r\nIX. in succession--that the coronation banquets at this epoch used to\r\ntake place. Of the richness and beauty of the internal decorations of\r\nthis interesting edifice some idea may be gained from the accompanying\r\nillustrations.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORBELS, FROM THE CHAPTER COURT GATEWAY, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nThe stock of wine at Reims at the period of Mary's first visit must\r\nhave been very low, owing to the continued requisitions of it for\r\narmies in the field, for 'German reiters at Attigny,' and 'Italian\r\nlansquenets at Voulzy;' and no doubt its production subsequently\r\ndecreased to some extent from the orders issued to the surrounding\r\nvillagers to destroy all their ladders and vats lest they should fall\r\ninto the hands of the enemy, at the epoch of the threatened approach of\r\nthe German Emperor in 1552.\r\n\r\nAt the coronation of Francis II. in 1559, and at that of Charles IX.\r\n(the future instigator of the massacre of St. Bartholomew) two years\r\nlater, the citizens of Reims presented the newly-crowned monarchs with\r\nthe customary gifts of Burgundy and Champagne wines.[55] In the latter\r\ninstance, however, the gift met with an unexpected return, inasmuch\r\nas the king, after the fashion of Domitian, issued an edict in 1566,\r\nordering that vines should only occupy one-third of the area of a\r\ncanton, and that the remaining two-thirds should be arable and pasture\r\nland. When the forehead of Henry III., the last of the treacherous race\r\nof Valois, was touched with the holy oil by the Cardinal de Guise, the\r\nwine of Reims for the first time was alone used to furnish forth the\r\nattendant banquet, and the appreciative king modified his brother's\r\nedict to a simple recommendation to the governors of provinces to see\r\nthat the planting of vines did not lead to a neglect of other labours.\r\nDuring this reign the wine of Ay reached the acme of renown, and came\r\nto be described as 'the ordinary drink of kings and princes.'[56]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIGNERON OF THE SIXTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n(Facsimile of a woodcut of the period).]\r\n\r\nIn the troubles which followed the death of Henry III., when the east\r\nof France was laid desolate in turn by Huguenots and Leaguers, Germans\r\nand Spaniards; when Reims became a chief stronghold of the Catholics,\r\nwho formed a kind of Republic there, and the remaining towns and\r\nvillages of the district changed masters almost daily, the foragers\r\nof the party of Henry of Navarre and that of the League caused great\r\ntribulation amongst the vine-dressers and husbandmen of the Montagne\r\nand of the Marne. In 1589 very little wine could be vintaged around\r\nReims 'through the affluence of enemies,' dolefully remarks a local\r\nanalist.[57] After the battle of Ivry, Reims submitted to the king,\r\nbut many of the surrounding districts, Epernay among the number, still\r\nsided with his opponents. Epernay fell, however, in 1592, after a cruel\r\nsiege; and in the autumn of the same year the leaders of the respective\r\nparties met at the church of St. Tresain, at Avenay, and agreed to a\r\ntruce during the ensuing harvest, in order that the crops of corn and\r\nwine might be gathered in--a truce known as the Trève des Moissons. The\r\nyield turned out to be of very good quality, the new wine fetching from\r\n40 to 70 livres the queue.[58]\r\n\r\nThe system of cultivation prevailing in the French vineyards at this\r\nepoch must have been peculiar, since the staple agricultural authority\r\nof the day states that, to have an abundant crop and good wine, all\r\nthat was necessary was for the vine-dresser to wear a garland of ivy,\r\nand for crushed acorns and ground vetches to be put in the hole at\r\nthe time of planting the vine-shoots; that, moreover, grapes without\r\nstones could be obtained by taking out the pith of the young plant,\r\nand wrapping the end in wet paper, or sticking it in an onion when\r\nplanting; that to get grapes in spring a vine-shoot should be grafted\r\non a cherry-tree; and that wine could be made purgative by watering\r\nthe roots of the vine with a laxative, or inserting some in a cleft\r\nbranch.[59]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    Church of St. Jacques.

In 1604 the yield was so abundant that the\r\nvintagers were at their wits' end for vessels to contain their wine;\r\nbut three years later so poor a vintage took place as had not been\r\nknown within the memory of man. During the winter the cold was so\r\nintense that wine froze not only in the cellars, but at table close to\r\nthe fire, and by the ensuing spring it had grown so scarce that the\r\nveriest rubbish fetched 80 livres the queue at Reims.[60] In 1610, at\r\nthe banquet following the coronation of Louis XIII., the only wine\r\nserved was that of Reims, at 175 livres, or about 7_l._, the queue; and\r\nthe future _raffinés_ of the Place Royale who assisted at that ceremony\r\nwere by no means the men to forget or neglect an approved vintage\r\nafter once tasting it. Champagne, it has been said, was crowned at the\r\nsame time with the king, and of the two made a better monarch. Five\r\nyears later a complaint, addressed to the king on the subject of the\r\n_fermiers des aides_ trying to levy duties on goods sold at the fairs,\r\nasserted it was notorious that the chief commerce of Reims consisted\r\nof wines. According to the police ordinances of 1627, the price of\r\nthese was fixed three times a year, namely, at Martinmas, Mid-Lent, and\r\nMidsummer; and tavern-keepers were bound to have a tablet inscribed\r\nwith the regulation price fixed outside their houses, and were not\r\nallowed to sell at a higher rate, under a penalty of 12 livres for the\r\nfirst, and 24 livres for the second offence. Moreover, to encourage the\r\nproduction of the locality, they were strictly forbidden to sell in\r\ntheir taverns any other wine than that of the 'cru du pays et de huit\r\nlieues es environs,' under pain of confiscation and a fine, the amount\r\nof which was arbitrary. The vine-dressers too, in the same ordinances,\r\nwere enjoined to kill and burn all vine-slugs and other vermin, which\r\nduring 1621 and the two succeeding years had caused much damage.[61]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThis rule must have been perforce relaxed during the troubles of the\r\nFronde, when for two years the troops of the Marshal du Plessis Praslin\r\nlived as in a conquered country, indulging in drinking carousals in\r\nthe wine-shops of the towns, or marching in detachments from village\r\nto village throughout the district, in order to prevent all those\r\nwho neglected to pay the contributions imposed from working in their\r\nvineyards; when their leader, on the refusal of the Rémois to supply\r\nhim with money, ravaged the vineyards of the plains of les Moineaux\r\nand Sacy; and when Erlach's foreigners at Verzy sacked the whole of\r\nthe Montagne from March until July 1650. As a consequence, people in\r\nthe following year were existing on herbs, roots, snails, blood, bread\r\nmade of bran, cats, dogs, &c., or dying by hundreds through eating\r\nbread made of unripe wheat harvested in June; the ruin of the citizens\r\nbeing completed, according to an eyewitness, at the epoch of dressing\r\nthe vines, owing to the lack of men to do the work.[62] A contemporary\r\nwriter, however, asserts that the vineyards still continued 'to cover\r\nthe mountains and to encircle the town of Reims like a crown of\r\nverdure;' and that their produce not only supplied all local wants,\r\nbut, transported beyond the frontier, caused the gold of the Indies to\r\nflow in return into the town, and spread its reputation afar.[63]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A BETROTHAL BANQUET IN THE SEVENTEENTH CENTURY.]\r\n\r\nSuch was the repute of the Champagne wines when Louis XIV. was crowned\r\nat Reims in 1654, that all the great lords present on the occasion were\r\nexceedingly anxious to partake of them, and no doubt regarded with\r\nenvious eyes the huge basket containing a hundred bottles of the best\r\nwhich the deputies from Epernay had brought with them as a present to\r\nthe gallant Turenne. He at least was no stranger to the merits of the\r\nwine, for the records of Epernay show that many a caque had found its\r\nway to his tent during the two preceding years, when he was defending\r\nthe Champagne against Condé and his Spanish allies. In the same year\r\n(1654), the Procureur de l'Echevinage speaks of the chief trade of\r\nReims as consisting in the sale of wine, of which the inhabitants\r\ncollect large quantities, both from the Montagne de Reims and the\r\nRivière de Marne, through the merchants who make this their special\r\ntrade--a trade sorely interrupted by the incursions of Montal and his\r\nSpaniards in 1657 and 1658. Guy Patin too, writing in 1666, mentions\r\nthe fact of Louis XIV. making a present to Charles II. of England\r\nof two hundred pièces of excellent wine--Champagne, Burgundy, and\r\nHermitage; and three years later is fain himself to exclaim, 'Vive le\r\npain de Gonesse, vive le bon vin de Paris, de Bourgogne, de Champagne!'\r\nwhilst Tavernier the traveller did his best to spread the fame of the\r\nChampagne wine by presenting specimens to all the sovereigns whom he\r\nhad the honour of saluting during his journeyings abroad.[64]\r\n\r\nIt was about the eighth decade of this century, when the renown of the\r\nGrand Monarque was yet at its apogee, and when for many years the soil\r\nof the province had not been profaned by the foot of an invader, that\r\nthe still wine of the Champagne attained its final point of perfection.\r\nThe Roi Soleil himself, we are assured by St. Simon, never drank any\r\nother wine in his life till about 1692, when his physician, the austere\r\nFagon, condemned his debilitated stomach to well-watered Burgundy, so\r\nold that it was almost tasteless, and the king consoled himself with\r\nlaughing at the wry faces pulled by foreign nobles who sought and\r\nobtained the honour of tasting his especial tipple.[65] An anonymous\r\nMémoire[66] written early in the ensuing century (1718) states that,\r\nalthough their red wine had long before been made with greater care\r\nand cleanliness than any other wine in the kingdom, the Champenois\r\nhad only studied to produce a _gray_, and indeed almost white, wine,\r\nwithin the preceding fifty years. This would place about 1670 the first\r\nintroduction of the new colourless wine, obtained by gathering grapes\r\nof the black variety with the utmost care at early dawn, and ceasing\r\nthe vintage at nine or ten in the morning, unless the day were cloudy.\r\nDespite these precautions a rosy tinge--compared to that lent by a\r\ndying sunset to the waters of a clear stream--was often communicated\r\nto the wine, and led to the term 'partridge's eye' being applied to\r\nit. St. Evremond, the epicurean Frenchman--who emigrated to the gay\r\ncourt of Charles II. at Whitehall to escape the gloomy cell designed\r\nfor him in the Bastille--and the mentor of the Count de Grammont,\r\nwriting from London about 1674, to his brother 'profès dans l'ordre des\r\ncoteaux,'[67] the Count d'Olonne, then undergoing on his part a species\r\nof exile at Orleans for having suffered his tongue to wag a little\r\ntoo freely at court, says: 'Do not spare any expense to get Champagne\r\nwines, even if you are at two hundred leagues from Paris. Those of\r\nBurgundy have lost their credit amongst men of taste, and barely retain\r\na remnant of their former reputation amongst dealers. There is no\r\nprovince which furnishes excellent wines for all seasons but Champagne.\r\nIt supplies us with the wines of Ay, Avenay, and Hautvillers, up to the\r\nspring; Taissy, Sillery, Verzenai, for the rest of the year.'[68] 'The\r\nwines of the Champagne,' elsewhere remarks this renowned _gourmet_,\r\n'are the best. Do not keep those of Ay too long; do not begin those of\r\nReims too soon. Cold weather preserves the spirit of the River wines,\r\nhot removes the _goût de terroir_ from those of the Mountain.' Writing\r\nalso in 1701, he alludes to the care with which the Sillery wines were\r\nmade forty years before.\r\n\r\nSuch a distinction of seasons would imply that wine, instead of\r\nbeing kept, was drunk within a few months of its manufacture; though\r\nthis, except in the case of wine made as 'tocane,' which could not\r\nbe kept, would appear to be a matter rather of taste than necessity.\r\nThis custom of drinking it before fermentation was achieved, and\r\nalso the natural tendency of the wine of this particular region to\r\neffervesce--a tendency since taken such signal advantage of by the\r\nmanufacturers of sparkling Champagne--are treated of in a work of\r\nthe period,[69] the author of which, after noting the excellence of\r\ncertain growths of Burgundy, goes on to say that, 'If the vintage in\r\nthe Champagne is a successful one, it is thither that the shrewd and\r\ndainty hasten. There is not,' continues he, 'in the world a drink more\r\nnoble and more delicious; and it is now become so highly fashionable\r\nthat, with the exception of those growths drawn from that fertile and\r\nagreeable district which we call in general parlance that of Reims, and\r\nparticularly from St. Thierry, Verzenay, Ay, and different spots of the\r\nMountain, all others are looked upon by the dainty as little better\r\nthan poor stuff and trash, which they will not even hear spoken of.' He\r\nextols the admirable _sève_ of the Reims wine, its delicious flavour,\r\nand its perfume, which with ludicrous hyperbole he pronounces capable\r\nof bringing the dead to life. Burgundy and Champagne, he says, are both\r\ngood, but the first rank belongs to the latter, 'when it has not that\r\ntartness which some debauchees esteem so highly, when it clears itself\r\npromptly, and only works as much as the natural strength of the wine\r\nallows; for it does not do to trust so much to that kind of wine which\r\nis always in a fury, and boils without intermission in its vessel.'\r\n\r\nSuch wine, he maintains, is quite done for by the time Easter is over,\r\nand only retains of its former fire a crude tartness very unpleasant\r\nand very indigestible, which is apt to affect the chest of those who\r\ndrink it. He recommends that Champagne should be drunk at least six\r\nmonths after the end of the year, and that the grayest wines should\r\nalways be chosen as going down more smoothly and clogging the stomach\r\nless, since, however good the red wine may be as regards body, from\r\nits longer _cuvaison_, it is never so delicate, nor does it digest so\r\npromptly, as the others. He concludes, therefore, that it is better\r\nto drink old wine, or at any rate what then passed as old wine, as\r\nlong as one can, in order not to have to turn too soon to the new\r\nones, 'which are veritable head-splitters, and from their potency\r\ncapable of deranging the strongest constitutions.' Above all, he urges\r\nabstinence from such 'artificial mummeries' as the use of ice, 'the\r\nmost pernicious of all inventions' and the enemy of wine, though at\r\nthat time, he admits, very fashionable, especially amongst certain\r\n'obstreperous voluptuaries,' 'who maintain that the wine of Reims is\r\nnever more delicious than when it is drunk with ice, and that this\r\nadmirable beverage derives especial charms from this fatal novelty.'\r\nIce, he holds, not only dispels the spirit and diminishes the flavour,\r\n_sève_, and colour of the wine, but is most pernicious and deadly\r\nto the drinker, causing 'colics, shiverings, horrible convulsions,\r\nand sudden weakness, so that frequently death has crowned the most\r\nmagnificent debauches, and turned a place of joy and mirth into a\r\nsepulchre.' Wherefore let all drinkers of Champagne _frappé_ beware.\r\n\r\nHere we have ample proof of the popularity of the wines of the\r\nChampagne, a popularity erroneously said to be due in some measure\r\nto the fact that both the Chancellor le Tellier, father of Louvois,\r\nand Colbert, the energetic comptroller-general of the state finances,\r\nand son of a wool-merchant of Reims, possessed large vineyards in\r\nthe province.[70] Lafontaine, who was born in the neighbourhood,\r\ndeclared his preference for Reims above all cities, on account of the\r\nSainte Ampoule, its good wine, and the abundance of other charming\r\nobjects;[71] and Boileau, writing in 1674, depicts an ignorant\r\nchurchman, whose library consisted of a score of well-filled hogsheads,\r\nas being fully aware of the particular vineyard at Reims over which\r\nthe community he belonged to held a mortgage.[72] James II. of England\r\nwas particularly partial to the wine of the Champagne. When the\r\nquinquennial assembly of the clergy was held in 1700, at the Château of\r\nSt. Germain-en-Laye, where he was residing, Charles Maurice le Tellier,\r\nbrother to Louvois and Archbishop of Reims, who presided, 'kept a grand\r\ntable, and had some Champagne wine that was highly praised. The King\r\nof England, who rarely drank any other, heard of it, and sent to ask\r\nsome of the archbishop, who sent him six bottles. Some time afterwards\r\nthe king, who found the wine very good, sent to beg him to send some\r\nmore. The archbishop, more avaricious of his wine than of his money,\r\nanswered curtly that his wine was not mad, and therefore did not run\r\nabout the streets, and did not send him any.'[73] Du Chesne, who,\r\nwhen Fagon became medical attendant to Louis XIV., succeeded him as\r\nphysician to the 'fils de France,' and who died at Versailles in 1707,\r\naged ninety-one, in perfect health, ascribed his longevity to his habit\r\nof eating a salad every night at supper, and drinking only Champagne, a\r\n_régime_ which he recommended to all.[74]\r\n\r\nThe wine was nevertheless the indirect cause of the death of the poet\r\nSanteuil, who, although a canon of St. Victor, was very much fonder\r\nof Champagne and of sundry other good things than he ought to have\r\nbeen. A wit and a _bon vivant_, he was a great favourite of the Duc de\r\nBourbon, son of the Prince de Condé, whom he accompanied in the summer\r\nof 1697 to Dijon. 'One evening at supper the duke amused himself with\r\nplying Santeuil with Champagne, and going on from joke to joke, he\r\nthought it funny to empty his snuff-box into a goblet of wine, and make\r\nSanteuil drink it, in order to see what would happen. He was pretty\r\nsoon enlightened. Vomiting and fever ensued, and within forty-eight\r\nhours the unhappy wretch died in the torments of the damned, but\r\nfilled with the sentiments of great penitence, with which he received\r\nthe sacraments and edified the company, who, though little given to\r\nbe edified, disapproved of _such a cruel experiment_.'[75] Of course\r\nnothing was done, or even said, to the duke.\r\n\r\n'Sire,' said the president of a deputation bringing specimens of the\r\nvarious productions of Reims to the Grand Monarque when he visited the\r\ncity in 1666, 'we offer you our wine, our pears, our gingerbread, our\r\nbiscuits, and our hearts;' and Louis, who was a noted lover of the good\r\nthings of this life, answered, turning to his suite, 'There, gentlemen,\r\nthat is just the kind of speech I like.' To this day Reims manufactures\r\nby the myriad the crisp finger-shaped sponge-cakes called 'biscuits de\r\nReims,' which the French delight to dip in their wine; juvenile France\r\nstill eagerly devours its _pain d'épice_, and the city sends forth far\r\nand wide the baked pears which have obtained so enviable a reputation.\r\nBut the production of such wine as that offered to the king has long\r\nsince almost ceased, while its fame has been eclipsed tenfold by wine\r\nof a far more delicious kind, the origin and rise of which has now to\r\nbe recounted. This is the sparkling wine of Champagne, which has been\r\nfitly compared to one of those younger sons of good family, who, after\r\na brilliant and rapid career, achieve a position far eclipsing that of\r\ntheir elder brethren, whose fame becomes merged in theirs.[76]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\n          /Invention and Development of Sparkling Champagne./\r\n\r\n    The ancients acquainted with sparkling wines--Tendency of Champagne\r\n    wines to effervesce noted at an early period--Obscurity enveloping\r\n    the discovery of what we now know as sparkling Champagne--The Royal\r\n    Abbey of Hautvillers--Legend of its foundation by St. Nivard and\r\n    St. Berchier--Its territorial possessions and vineyards--The monks\r\n    the great viticulturists of the Middle Ages--Dom Perignon--He\r\n    marries wines differing in character--His discovery of sparkling\r\n    white wine--He is the first to use corks to bottles--His secret for\r\n    clearing the wine revealed only to his successors Frère Philippe\r\n    and Dom Grossart--Result of Dom Perignon's discoveries--The wine\r\n    of Hautvillers sold at 1000 livres the queue--Dom Perignon's\r\n    memorial in the Abbey-Church--Wine flavoured with peaches--The\r\n    effervescence ascribed to drugs, to the period of the moon, and\r\n    to the action of the sap in the vine--The fame of sparkling\r\n    wine rapidly spreads--The Vin de Perignon makes its appearance\r\n    at the Court of the Grand Monarque--Is welcomed by the young\r\n    courtiers--It figures at the suppers of Anet and Chantilly, and\r\n    at the orgies of the Temple and the Palais Royal--The rapturous\r\n    strophes of Chaulieu and Rousseau--Frederick William I. and the\r\n    Berlin Academicians--Augustus the Strong and the page who pilfered\r\n    his Champagne--Horror of the old-fashioned _gourmets_ at the\r\n    innovation--Bertin du Rocheret and the Marshal d'Artagnan--System\r\n    of wine-making in the Champagne early in the eighteenth\r\n    century--Bottling of the wine in flasks--Icing Champagne with the\r\n    corks loosened.\r\n\r\n\r\nA sybarite of our day has remarked that the life of the ancient Greeks\r\nwould have approached the perfection of earthly existence had they\r\nonly been acquainted with sparkling Champagne. As, however, amongst\r\nthe nations of antiquity the newly-made wine was sometimes allowed\r\nto continue its fermentation in close vessels, it may be conceived\r\nthat when freshly drawn it occasionally possessed a certain degree of\r\nbriskness from the retained carbonic acid gas.[77] Virgil's expression,\r\n\r\n        'Ille impiger hausit\r\n    Spumantem pateram,'[78]\r\n\r\ndemonstrates that the Romans--whose _patera_, by the way, closely\r\nresembled the modern champagne-glass--were familiar with frothy and\r\nsparkling wines, although they do not seem to have intentionally sought\r\nthe means of preserving them in this condition.[79]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe early vintagers of the Champagne can hardly have helped noting\r\nthe natural tendency of their wine to effervesce, the difficulty of\r\nentirely overcoming which is exemplified in the precautions invariably\r\ntaken for the production of Sillery sec; indeed tradition claims for\r\ncertain growths of the Marne, from a period of remote antiquity,\r\na disposition to froth and sparkle.[80] Local writers profess to\r\nrecognise in the property ascribed by Henry of Andelys to the wine\r\nof Chalons, of causing both the stomach and the heels to swell,[81]\r\na reference to this peculiarity.[82] The learned Baccius, physician\r\nto Pope Sixtus V., writing at the close of the sixteenth century of\r\nthe wines of France, mentions those 'which bubble out of the glass,\r\nand which flatter the smell as much as the taste,'[83] though he does\r\nnot refer to any wine of the Champagne by name. An anonymous author,\r\nsome eighty years later,[84] condemns the growing partiality for the\r\n'great _vert_ which certain debauchees esteem so highly' in Champagne\r\nwines, and denounces 'that kind of wine which is always in a fury,\r\nand which boils without ceasing in its vessel.' Still he seems to\r\nrefer to wine in casks, which lost these tumultuous properties after\r\nEaster. Necessity being the mother of invention, the inhabitants of\r\nthe province had in the sixteenth century already devised and put in\r\npractice a method of allaying fermentation, and obtaining a settled\r\nwine within four-and-twenty hours, by filling a vessel with 'small\r\nchips of the wood called in French _sayette_,' and pouring the wine\r\nover them.[85]\r\n\r\nWith all this, a conscientious writer candidly acknowledges that,\r\ndespite minute and painstaking researches, he cannot tell when what is\r\nnow known as sparkling Champagne first made its appearance. The most\r\nancient references to it of a positive character that he could discover\r\nare contained in the poems of Grenan and Coffin, printed in 1711 and\r\n1712; yet its invention certainly dates prior to that epoch,[86] and\r\nearlier poets have also praised it. It seems most probable that the\r\ntendency to effervescence already noted became even more marked in\r\nthe strong-bodied gray and 'partridge-eye' wines, first made from red\r\ngrapes about 1670, than in the yellowish wine previously produced, like\r\nthat of Ay, from white grapes,[87] and recommended, from its deficiency\r\nin body, to be drunk off within the year.[88] These new wines, when in\r\na quasi-effervescent state prior to the month of March, offered a novel\r\nattraction to palates dulled by the potent vintages of Burgundy and\r\nSouthern France;[89] and their reputation quickly spread, though some\r\nold _gourmets_ might have complained, with St. Evremond, of the taste\r\nintroduced by _faux delicats_.[90] They must have been merely _cremant_\r\nwines--for glass-bottle making was in its infancy, and corks as yet\r\nunknown[91]--and doubtless resembled the present wines of Condrieu,\r\nwhich sparkle in the glass on being poured out, during their first and\r\nsecond years, but with age acquire the characteristics of a full-bodied\r\nstill wine. The difficulty of regulating their effervescence in\r\nthose pre-scientific days must have led to frequent and serious\r\ndisappointments. The hour, however, came, and with it the man.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATEWAY OF THE ABBEY OF HAUTVILLERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHURCH OF HAUTVILLERS, WITH THE REMAINS OF THE\r\nABBEY.]\r\n\r\nIn the year 1670, among the sunny vineyard slopes rising from the\r\npoplar-fringed Marne, there stood in all its pride the famous royal\r\nAbbey of St. Peter at Hautvillers. Its foundation, of remote antiquity,\r\nwas hallowed by saintly legend. Tradition said that about the middle\r\nof the seventh century St. Nivard, Bishop of Reims, and his godson,\r\nSt. Berchier, were seeking a suitable spot for the erection of a\r\nmonastery on the banks of the river. The way was long, the day was\r\nwarm, and the saints but mortal. Weary and faint, they sat down to\r\nrest at a spot identified by tradition with a vineyard at Dizy, to-day\r\nbelonging to Messrs. Bollinger, but at that time forming part of the\r\nforest of the Marne. St. Nivard fell asleep, with his head in St.\r\nBerchier's lap, when the one in a dream, and the other with waking\r\neyes, saw a snow-white dove--the same, firm believers in miracles\r\nsuggested, which had brought down the holy oil for the anointment\r\nof Clovis at his coronation at Reims--flutter through the wood, and\r\nfinally alight afar off on the stump of a tree. Such an omen could\r\nno more be neglected by a seventh-century saint than a slate full of\r\nscribble by a nineteenth-century spiritualist, and accordingly the\r\nsite thus miraculously indicated was forthwith decided upon. Plans for\r\nthe edifice were duly drawn out and approved of, and the abbey rose\r\nin stately majesty, the high altar at which St. Berchier was solemnly\r\ninvested with the symbols of abbatial dignity being erected upon the\r\nprecise spot occupied by the tree on which the snow-white dove had\r\nalighted.[92] As time rolled on and pious donations poured in, the\r\nabbey waxed in importance, although it was sacked by the Normans when\r\nthey ravaged the Champagne, and was twice destroyed by fire--once in\r\n1098, and again in 1440--when each time it rose ph[oe]nix-like from its\r\nashes.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn 1670 the abbey was, as we have said, in all its glory. True, it had\r\nbeen somewhat damaged a century previously by the Huguenots, who had\r\nfired the church, driven out the monks, sacked the wine-cellars, burnt\r\nthe archives, and committed sundry other depredations inherent to civil\r\nand religious warfare; but the liberal contributions of the faithful,\r\nincluding Queen Marie de Medicis, had helped to efface all traces of\r\ntheir visit. The abbey boasted many precious relics rescued from the\r\nReformers' fury, the most important being the body of St. Helena, the\r\nmother of Constantine the Great, which had been in its possession since\r\n844, and attracted numerous pilgrims. The hierarchical status of the\r\nabbey was high; for no less than nine archbishops had passed forth\r\nthrough its stately portal to the see of Reims, and twenty-two abbots,\r\nincluding the venerable Peter of Cluny, to various distinguished\r\nmonasteries. Its territorial possessions were extensive; for its abbot\r\nwas lord of Hautvillers, Cumières, Cormoyeux, Bomery, and Dizy la\r\nRivière, and had all manner of rights of _fourmage_, and _huchage_,\r\n_vinage_, and _pressoir banal_, and the like,[93] to the benefit\r\nof the monks and the misfortune of their numerous dependents. Its\r\nrevenues were ample, and no small portion was derived from the tithes\r\nof fair and fertile vinelands extending for miles around, and from\r\nthe vineyards which the monks themselves cultivated in the immediate\r\nneighbourhood of the abbey.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt should be remembered that for a lengthy period--not only in France,\r\nbut in other countries--the choicest wines were those produced in\r\nvineyards belonging to the Church, and that the _vinum theologium_ was\r\njustly held superior to all others. The rich chapters and monasteries\r\nwere more studious of the quality than of the quantity of their\r\nvintages; their land was tilled with particular care, and the learning,\r\nof which in the Middle Ages they were almost the sole depositaries,\r\ncombined with opportunities of observation enjoyed by the members of\r\nthese fraternities by reason of their retired pursuits, made them\r\nacquainted at a very early period with the best methods of controlling\r\nthe fermentation of the grape and ameliorating its produce.[94] To\r\nthe monks of Bèze we owe Chambertin, the favourite wine of the first\r\nNapoleon; to the Cistercians of Citaulx the perfection of that Clos\r\nVougeot which passing regiments saluted _tambour battant_; and the\r\nBenedictines of Hautvillers were equally regardful of the renown of\r\ntheir wines and vineyards. In 1636 they cultivated one hundred arpents\r\nthemselves,[95] their possessions including the vineyards now known as\r\nLes Quartiers and Les Prières at Hautvillers, and Les Barillets, Sainte\r\nHélène, and Cotes-à-bras at Cumières, the last named of which still\r\nretains a high reputation.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOver these vineyards there presided in 1670 a worthy Benedictine named\r\nDom Perignon, who was destined to gain for the abbey a more world-wide\r\nfame than the devoutest of its monks or the proudest of its abbots.\r\nHis position was an onerous one, for the reputation of the wine was\r\nconsiderable, and it was necessary to maintain it. Henry of Andelys had\r\nsung its praises as early as the thirteenth century; and St. Evremond,\r\nthough absent from France for nearly half a score years, wrote of it\r\nin terms proving that he had preserved a lively recollection of its\r\nmerits. Dom Perignon was born at Sainte Ménehould in 1638, and had\r\nbeen elected to the post of procureur of the abbey about 1668, on\r\naccount of the purity of his taste and the soundness of his head. He\r\nproved himself fully equal to the momentous task, devotion to which\r\ndoes not seem to have shortened his days, since he died at the ripe\r\nold age of seventy-seven. It was Dom Perignon's duty to superintend\r\nthe abbey vineyards, supervise the making of the wine, and see after\r\nthe tithes, paid either in wine or grapes[96] by the neighbouring\r\ncultivators to their seignorial lord the abbot. The wine which thus\r\ncame into his charge was naturally of various qualities; and having\r\nnoted that one kind of soil imparted fragrance and another generosity,\r\nwhile the produce of others was deficient in both of these attributes,\r\nDom Perignon, in the spirit of a true Benedictine, hit upon the happy\r\nidea of 'marrying,' or blending, the produce of different vineyards\r\ntogether,[97] a practice which is to-day very generally followed\r\nby the manufacturers of Champagne. Such was the perfection of Dom\r\nPerignon's skill and the delicacy of his palate, that in his later\r\nyears, when blind from age, he used to have the grapes of the different\r\ndistricts brought to him, and, recognising each kind by its flavour,\r\nwould say, 'You must marry the wine of this vineyard with that of such\r\nanother.'[98]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut the crowning glory of the Benedictine's long and useful life\r\nremains to be told. He succeeded in obtaining for the first time in\r\nthe Champagne a perfectly white wine from black grapes, that hitherto\r\nmade having been gray, or of a pale-straw colour.[99] Moreover, by some\r\nhappy accident, or by a series of experimental researches--for the\r\nexact facts of the discovery are lost for ever--he hit upon a method\r\nof regulating the tendency of the wines of this region to effervesce,\r\nand by paying regard to the epoch of bottling, finally succeeded in\r\nproducing a perfectly sparkling wine, that burst forth from the bottle\r\nand overflowed the glass, and was twice as dainty to the palate, and\r\ntwice as exhilarating in its effects, as the ordinary wine of the\r\nChampagne. A correlative result of his investigations was the present\r\nsystem of corking bottles, a wisp of tow dipped in oil being the sole\r\nstopper in use prior to his time.[100] To him, too, we owe not only\r\nsparkling Champagne itself, but the proper kind of glass to drink it\r\nout of. The tall, thin, tapering _flute_ was adopted, if not invented,\r\nby him, in order, as he said, that he might watch the dance of the\r\nsparkling atoms.[101] The exact date of Dom Perignon's discovery of\r\nsparkling wine seems to be wrapped in much the same obscurity as\r\nare the various attendant circumstances. It was certainly prior to\r\nthe close of the seventeenth century; as the author of an anonymous\r\ntreatise, printed at Reims in 1718, remarked that for more than twenty\r\nyears past the taste of the French had inclined towards sparkling\r\nwines, which they had 'frantically adored,' though during the last\r\nthree years they had grown a little out of conceit with them.[102] This\r\nwould place it at 1697, at the latest.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo Dom Perignon the abbey's well-stocked cellar was a far cheerfuller\r\nplace than the cell. Nothing delighted him more than\r\n\r\n    'To come down among this brotherhood\r\n        Dwelling for ever underground,\r\n        Silent, contemplative, round, and sound;\r\n    Each one old and brown with mould,\r\n        But filled to the lips with the ardour of youth,\r\n        With the latent power and love of truth,\r\n    And with virtues fervent and manifold.'\r\n\r\nEver busy among his vats and presses, barrels and bottles, Perignon\r\nfound out a method of clearing wine, so as to preserve it perfectly\r\nlimpid and free from all deposit, without being obliged, like all who\r\nsought to rival him in its production, to _dépoter_ the bottles--that\r\nis, to decant their contents into fresh ones.[103] This secret, which\r\nhelped to maintain the high reputation of the wine of Hautvillers when\r\nthe manufacture of sparkling Champagne had extended throughout the\r\ndistrict, he guarded even better than he was able to guard the apple of\r\nhis eye. At his death, in 1715, he revealed it only to his successor,\r\nFrère Philippe, who, after holding sway over vat and vineyard for\r\nfifty years, died in 1765, imparting it with his latest breath to\r\nFrère André Lemaire. Revoked perforce from his functions by the French\r\nRevolution, he in turn, before his death about 1795, communicated it\r\nto Dom Grossart, who exults over the fact that whilst the greatest\r\nChampagne merchants were obliged to _dépoter_, the monks of Hautvillers\r\nhad never done so.[104] Dom Grossart, who had counted the Moëts amongst\r\nhis customers, died in his turn without making any sign, so that the\r\nsecret of Perignon perished with him. Prior to that event, however,\r\nthe present system of _dégorgeage_ was discovered, and eventually\r\n_dépotage_ was no longer practised.[105]\r\n\r\nThe material result of Dom Perignon's labours was such that one of the\r\npresses of the abbey bore this inscription: 'M. de Fourville, abbot of\r\nthis abbey, had me constructed in the year 1694, and that same year\r\nsold his wine at a thousand livres the queue.'[106] Their moral effect\r\nwas so complete that his name became identified with the wine of the\r\nabbey. People asked for the wine of Perignon, till they forgot that\r\nhe was a man and not a vineyard,[107] and within a year of his death\r\nhis name figures amongst a list of the wine-producing slopes of the\r\nChampagne.[108] His reputation has outlasted the walls within which he\r\ncarried on his labours, and his merits are thus recorded, in conventual\r\nLatin of the period, on a black-marble slab still to be seen within the\r\naltar-steps of the abbey-church of Hautvillers.[109]\r\n\r\n[Illustration:\r\n\r\n    D .

According to this, a pound of sugar-candy\r\nwas dissolved in a _chopine_ of wine, to which was then added five or\r\nsix stoned peaches, four sous' worth of powdered cinnamon, a grated\r\nnutmeg, and a _demi septier_ of burnt brandy; and the whole, after\r\nbeing well mixed, was strained through fine linen into a _pièce_ of\r\nwine immediately after fermentation had ceased, with the result of\r\nimparting to it a dainty and delicate flavour. Dom Grossart, however,\r\nin his letter to M. Dherbès, distinctly declares that 'we never did put\r\nsugar into our wine.'[110] This _collature_, in which peaches play a\r\npart, was probably made use of by some wine-growers; and the peach-like\r\nflavour extolled by St. Evremond in the wine of Ay may have been due\r\nto it, or to the practice then and long afterwards followed of putting\r\npeach-leaves in the hot water with which the barrels were washed out,\r\nunder the idea that this improved the flavour of the wine.[111]\r\n\r\nOpinions were widely divided as to the cause of the effervescence\r\nin the wines of Hautvillers, for the connection between sugar and\r\nfermentation was then undreamt of, although Van Helmont had recognised\r\nthe existence of carbonic acid gas in fermenting wine as early as 1624.\r\nSome thought it due to the addition of drugs, and sought to obtain it\r\nby putting not only alum and spirits of wine, but positive nastinesses,\r\ninto their wine.[112] Others ascribed it to the greenness of the wine,\r\nbecause most of that which effervesced was extremely raw; and others\r\nagain believed that it was influenced by the age of the moon at the\r\nepoch of bottling. Experience undoubtedly showed that wine bottled\r\nbetween the vintage and the month of May was certain to effervesce, and\r\nthat no time was more favourable for this operation than the end of\r\nthe second quarter of the moon of March. Nevertheless, as the wines,\r\nespecially those of the Mountain of Reims, were not usually matured at\r\nthis epoch, it was recommended, in order to secure a ripe and exquisite\r\nsparkling wine, to defer the bottling until the ascent of the sap in\r\nthe vine between the tenth and fourteenth day of the moon of August;\r\nwhereas, to insure a _non mousseux_ wine, the bottling ought to take\r\nplace in October or November.[113]\r\n\r\nThe fame of the new wine, known indifferently as _vin de Perignon_,\r\n_flacon pétillant_, _flacon mousseux_, _vin sautant_, _vin mousseux_,\r\n_saute bouchon_, &c., and even anathematised as _vin du diable_--for\r\nthe present term, _vin de Champagne_, was confined as yet to the still\r\nor quasi-still growths--quickly spread. Never, indeed, was a discovery\r\nmore opportune. At the moment of its introduction the glory of France\r\nwas on the wane; Colbert, Louvois, and Luxembourg were dead; the Treaty\r\nof Ryswick had been signed; famine and deficit reared their threatening\r\nheads, and lo, Providence offered this new consolation for all outward\r\nand inward ills. With the King it could only find scant favour. The\r\nonce brilliant Louis was now a bigoted and almost isolated invalid. His\r\ndebilitated stomach, ruined by long indulgence, could scarcely even\r\nsupport the old Burgundy--so old that it was almost tasteless--which\r\nFagon had prescribed as his sole beverage some years before;[114] and\r\nthe popping of sparkling Champagne corks would have scandalised the\r\nquiet _tête-à-tête_ repasts which he was wont to partake of with the\r\npious Madame de Maintenon.[115]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut the men who were to be the future _roués_ of the Regency were\r\nin the flower of youthful manhood in 1698, and the recommendation\r\nof Comus had with them more weight than the warnings of Æsculapius.\r\nAt the joyous suppers of Anet, where the Duc de Vendôme laid aside\r\nthe laurels of Mars to wreathe his brows with the ivy of Bacchus; at\r\nthe Temple, where his brother, the Grand Prior, nightly revived the\r\nmost scandalous features of the orgies of ancient Rome; at the Palais\r\nRoyal, where the future Regent was inaugurating that long series of\r\n_petits soupers_ which were ultimately to cost the lives of himself and\r\nhis favourite daughter; and at Chantilly, where the Prince de Conti\r\nsought successfully to reproduce a younger and brighter Versailles,\r\nthe pear-shaped flasks, 'ten inches high, including the four or five\r\nof the neck,'[116] stamped with the arms of the noble hosts, and\r\nsecured with Spanish wax,[117] were an indispensable adjunct to the\r\nfestivities of the table. A story is told of the Marquis de Sillery,\r\nwho had turned his sword into a pruning-knife, and applied himself to\r\nthe cultivation of the paternal vineyards, having first introduced the\r\nsparkling wine bearing his name at one of the Anet suppers, when, at a\r\ngiven signal, a dozen of blooming young damsels, scantily draped in the\r\nguise of Bacchanals, entered the room, bearing apparently baskets of\r\nflowers in their hands, but which, on being placed before the guests,\r\nproved to be flower-enwreathed bottles of the new sparkling wine.[118]\r\nIf ever a beverage was intended for the pleasures of society, it was\r\ncertainly this one, which it was said Nature had made especially for\r\nthe French,[119] who found in its discovery a compensation for the\r\nvictories of Marlborough.\r\n\r\nChaulieu, the poetic abbé, and the favourite of both the Vendômes,\r\nhailed this new product of his native province in rapturous strophes.\r\nIn an invitation to supper addressed to his friend, the Marquis de la\r\nFare, in 1701, he describes how\r\n\r\n    'Of fivescore clear glasses the number and brightness\r\n    Make up for of dishes the absence and lightness,\r\n        And the foam, sparkling pure,\r\n        Of fresh delicate wine\r\n        For Fortune's frail lure\r\n    Blots out all regret in this memory of mine.'[120]\r\n\r\nIn a letter to St. Evremond, he mentions sundry wonderful things that\r\nshould happen 'if the Muses were as fond of the wine of Champagne\r\nas the poet who writes this to you;' and, in one to the Marquis de\r\nDangeau, jestingly remarks that\r\n\r\n    'St. Maur's harsher muse\r\n    All flight will refuse,\r\n    Unless you sustain\r\n    Her wings with Champagne.'[121]\r\n\r\nReplying to an invitation to Sonning's house at Neuilly on July 20,\r\n1707, he says that when he comes it will be wonderful to see how the\r\nChampagne will be drained from the tall glasses known as _flutes_.[122]\r\nThat the Champagne he extols was a sparkling wine is established in a\r\npoetical epistle to Madame D., in answer to her complaint that the wine\r\nhe had sent her did not froth as when they supped together, and in this\r\nhe also speaks of its newness.\r\n\r\nHis brother-rhymster, Jean Baptiste Rousseau, who must not be\r\nconfounded with the philosophic Jean Jacques, invited Chaulieu to join\r\nhim at Neuilly, in mingling the water of Hippocrene with the wine of\r\nHautvillers,[123] and announced to the Champagne-loving Marquis d'Ussé,\r\n_apropos_ of the latter's favourite source of inspiration, that even\r\n\r\n    'Ph[oe]bus will no more go climbing\r\n        For water up Helicon's mount,\r\n    But admit, as a source of good rhyming,\r\n        Champagne excels Hippocrene's fount.'[124]\r\n\r\nSuch general attention did the subject attract that Frederick William\r\nII. of Prussia actually proposed to the Academy of Arts and Sciences\r\nat Berlin the question, 'Why does Champagne foam?' for solution. The\r\nAcademicians, with unexpected sharpness, petitioned the King for a\r\nsupply of the beverage in question on which to experiment. But the\r\nparsimonious monarch was equal to the occasion, and a solitary dozen\r\nof the wine was all he would consent to furnish them with. His ally,\r\nAugustus the Strong of Saxony, was the hero of a ludicrous adventure\r\nconnected with sparkling Champagne. At a banquet given to him at\r\nDresden, a page, who had surreptitiously appropriated a bottle of\r\nthis costly beverage, and hidden it in the breast of his coat, had to\r\napproach the King. The heat and motion combined had imparted briskness\r\nto the wine, out popped the cork, and the embroidered garments and\r\nflowing periwig of Mr. Carlyle's 'Man of Sin' were drenched with the\r\nfoaming liquid. The page fell on his knees and roared for mercy, and\r\nthe King, as soon as he recovered from his bursts of laughter, freely\r\nforgave him his offence.\r\n\r\nThe success of Dom Perignon's wine caused a revolution in the\r\nwine-production of the province, and gave rise to numerous imitations,\r\ndespite the outcry raised against sparkling wine by many _gourmets_,\r\nand even by the wine-merchants themselves, who complained that they\r\nhad to pander to what they regarded as a depraved taste. The elder\r\nBertin du Rocheret, father of the _lieutenant criminel_ and a notable\r\ndealer in wine, was much opposed to it.[125] Marshal de Montesquiou\r\nd'Artagnan, the gallant assailant of Denain, had ordered some wine of\r\nhim, and he writes in reply, on November 11, 1711: 'I have chosen three\r\npoinçons of the best wine of Pierry at 400 francs the queue, not to be\r\ndrawn off as _mousseux_--that would be too great a pity. Also a poinçon\r\nto be drawn off as _mousseux_ at 250 francs the queue; or, if you will\r\nonly go as far as 180 francs, it will froth just as well, or better.\r\nAlso a poinçon of _tocane_ of Ay to be drunk this winter--that is to\r\nsay, it should be drunk by Shrovetide--at 300 francs the queue: this\r\nwine is very fine.'[126]\r\n\r\nOn the 27th December 1712 the Marshal writes: 'With regard to my wine\r\nbeing made _mousseux_, many prefer that it should be so; and I should\r\nnot be vexed, provided it does not in any way depreciate its quality.'\r\nOn the 18th October of the following year the stern _laudator temporis\r\nacti_ describes how the bottling has been carried out, 'in order that\r\nyour wines might be _mousseux_, without which I should not have done\r\nit, and perhaps you would have found it better, but it would not have\r\nhad the merit of being _mousseux_, which in my opinion is the merit of\r\na poor wine, and only proper to beer, chocolate, and whipped cream.\r\nGood Champagne should be clear and fine, should sparkle in the glass,\r\nand should flatter the palate, as it never does when it is _mousseux_,\r\nbut has a smack of fermentation; hence it is only _mousseux_ because it\r\nis working.'\r\n\r\nThe converted Marshal replies on October 25th: 'I was in the wrong\r\nto ask you to bottle my wine so that it might be _mousseux_; it is a\r\nfashion that prevails everywhere, especially amongst young people.\r\nFor my own part, I care very little about it; but I wish the wine to\r\nbe clear and fine, and to have a strong Champagne bouquet.' In the\r\nfollowing December Bertin, in answer to the Marshal's request for three\r\nquartaux of wine, says: 'Will you kindly let me know at what date you\r\npropose to drink this wine? If it is to be drunk as _mousseux_, I shall\r\nnot agree with you.'\r\n\r\nThe allusion to the time of year at which the wine was to be drunk\r\nthrows a light upon a practice of the day, confirmed by other passages\r\nin this correspondence. Much of the wine made was drunk as _vin\r\nbourru_ fined, but not racked off, at the beginning of the year, or\r\nas _tocane_, which was apt to go off if kept beyond Shrovetide. This\r\nspeedy consumption and the careful choice made of the grapes intended\r\nfor _vin mousseux_ militated against the formation in the bottles of\r\nthat deposit, which, up to the commencement of the present century,\r\nwhen the system of _dégorgeage_ was introduced, could only be remedied\r\nby _dépotage_,[127] though, as we have seen, the Abbey of Hautvillers\r\nhad a secret method, carefully guarded, of checking its formation.[128]\r\n\r\nIt is singular that the presence of a natural _liqueur_--the\r\nconsequence of a complete but not excessive ripeness of the grape, and\r\nat present considered one of the highest qualities of the wine--was, at\r\nthe commencement of the eighteenth century, regarded as a disease. The\r\n_Mémoire_ of 1718 states that when the wine has any liqueur, however\r\ngood it may otherwise be, it is not esteemed, and recommends the owner\r\nto get rid of this 'bad quality' forthwith by putting a pint of new\r\nmilk warm from the cow into each _pièce_, stirring it well, letting\r\nit rest three days, and then racking the wine off. At this epoch the\r\nwine of the Champagne seems to have been preferred perfectly dry.[129]\r\nIn June 1716 the Marshal d'Artagnan reproached Bertin du Rocheret for\r\nsending him Hautvillers wine of the preceding vintage which had turned\r\nout _liquoreuse_. However, in August he felt forced to write that\r\nit had become excellent, and similar experiences seem to have soon\r\nremoved all prejudices against this liqueur character. Bertin, in 1725,\r\nspeaks of it as one of the qualities of wine, and charges for it in\r\nproportion; and six years later remarks that the English are as mad for\r\nliqueur and colour in their wines as the French.[130]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n                      /The Battle of the Wines./\r\n\r\n    Temporary check to the popularity of Sparkling Champagne--Doctors\r\n    disagree--The champions of Champagne and Burgundy--Péna and his\r\n    patient--A young Burgundian student attacks the Wine of Reims--The\r\n    Faculty of Reims in arms--A local Old Parr cited as an example\r\n    in favour of the Wines of the Champagne--Salins of Beaune and\r\n    Le Pescheur of Reims engage warmly in the dispute--A pelting\r\n    with pamphlets--Burgundy sounds a war-note--The Sapphics of\r\n    Benigné Grenan--An asp beneath the flowers--The gauntlet picked\r\n    up--Carols from a Coffin--Champagne extolled as superior to all\r\n    other wines--It inspires the heart and stirs the brain--The\r\n    apotheosis of Champagne foam--Burgundy, an invalid, seeks a\r\n    prescription--Impartially appreciative drinkers of both wines--Bold\r\n    Burgundian and stout Rémois, each a jolly tippling fellow--Canon\r\n    Maucroix's parallel between Burgundy and Demosthenes and Champagne\r\n    and Cicero--Champagne a panacea for gout and stone--Final decision\r\n    in favour of Champagne by the medical faculty of Paris--Pluche's\r\n    opinion on the controversy--Champagne a lively wit and Burgundy a\r\n    solid understanding--Champagne commands double the price of the\r\n    best Burgundy--Zealots reconciled at table.\r\n\r\n\r\nBy a strange fatality the popularity of the sparkling wine of the\r\nChampagne, which had helped to dissipate the gloom hanging over\r\ncourt and capital during the last twenty years of the reign of Louis\r\nQuatorze,[131] began to wane the year preceding that monarch's\r\ndeath.[132] Dom Perignon too, as though stricken to the heart by this,\r\nforthwith drooped and died. The inhabitants of the province once more\r\nturned their attention to their red wines, which continued to enjoy\r\na high reputation during the first half of the century,[133] despite\r\nthe sweeping assertion that they were somewhat dry, rather flat, and\r\npossessed a strong flinty flavour,[134] the _goût de terroir_ alluded\r\nto by St. Evremond.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThese red wines were not only sent to Paris in large quantities by\r\nway of the Marne,[135] but commanded an important export trade, those\r\nof the Mountain, which were better able to bear the journey than the\r\ngrowths of the River, gracing the best-appointed tables of London,\r\nAmsterdam, Copenhagen, and the North,[136] and especially of Flanders,\r\nwhere they were usually sold as Burgundy.[137] It must not be lost\r\nsight of that the yield of white sparkling wine from the _crûs d'élite_\r\nwas for a long time comparatively small, especially when contrasted\r\nwith that of to-day.[138] At a later period the manufacture of _vin\r\nmousseux_ increased, notably in the districts south of the Marne,[139]\r\nand drove out almost entirely the still red wine; the place of the\r\nlatter being supplied, as regards Holland, Belgium, and Northern\r\nFrance, by the growths of Bordeaux, which were found to keep better in\r\ndamp climates.[140]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOne cause of this falling off in the popularity of the sparkling wine\r\narose from the great battle which raged for many years respecting\r\nthe relative merits of Champagne and Burgundy. It was waged in the\r\nschools, and not in the field; for the combatants were neither dashing\r\nsoldiers, brilliant courtiers, nor even gay young students, but potent,\r\ngrave, and reverend physicians--the wigged, capped, and gowned pedants\r\nof the Diaphorus type whom Molière so piteously pilloried. The only\r\nblood shed was that of the grape, excepting when some enthusiastic\r\nSangrado was impelled by a too conscientious practical examination into\r\nthe qualities of the vintage he championed to a more than ordinary\r\nreckless use of the lancet. The contending armies couched pens instead\r\nof lances, and marshalled arguments in array in place of squadrons.\r\nThey hurled pamphlets and theses at each others' heads in lieu of\r\nbombshells, and kept up withal a running fire of versification, so that\r\nthe rumble of hexameters replaced that of artillery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nNational pride, and perhaps a smack of envy at the growing popularity\r\nof the still red wines of the Champagne, had, as far back as 1652, led\r\na hot-headed young Burgundian, one Daniel Arbinet, to select as the\r\nsubject of a thesis, maintained by him before the schools of Paris,\r\nthe proposition that the wine of Beaune was more delicious and more\r\nwholesome than any other wine,[141] the remaining vintages of the\r\nuniverse being pretty roughly handled in the thesis in question. The\r\nChampenois contented themselves for the time being with cultivating\r\ntheir vineyards and improving their wines, till in 1677, when these\r\nlatter had acquired yet more renown, M. de Révélois of Reims boldly\r\nrushed into print with the assertion that the wine of Reims was the\r\nmost wholesome of all.[142] Though the first to write in its favour,\r\nhe was not the first doctor of eminence who had expressed an opinion\r\nfavourable to the wine of Champagne. Péna, a leading Parisian physician\r\nof the seventeenth century, was once consulted by a stranger. 'Where\r\ndo you come from?' he inquired. 'I am a native of Saumur.' 'A native\r\nof Saumur. What bread do you eat?' 'Bread from the Belle Cave.' 'A\r\nnative of Saumur, and you eat bread from the Belle Cave. What meat\r\ndo you get?' 'Mutton fed at Chardonnet.' 'A native of Saumur, eating\r\nbread from the Belle Cave and mutton fed at Chardonnet. What wine do\r\nyou drink?' 'Wine from the Côteaux.'[143] 'What! You are a native\r\nof Saumur; you eat bread from the Belle Cave, and mutton fed at\r\nChardonnet, and drink the wine of the Côteaux, and you come here to\r\nconsult me! Go along; there can be nothing the matter with you!'[144]\r\n\r\nBurgundy remained silent in turn for nearly twenty years, when, lo, in\r\n1696--probably just about the time when the popping of Dom Perignon's\r\ncorks began to make some noise in the world--a yet more opinionated\r\nyoung champion of the Côte d'Or, Mathieu Fournier, a medical student,\r\nhard pressed for the subject of his inaugural thesis, and in the firm\r\nfaith that\r\n\r\n    'None but a clever dialectician\r\n    Can hope to become a good physician,\r\n    And that logic plays an important part\r\n    In the mystery of the healing art,'\r\n\r\npropounded the theory that the wines of Reims irritated the nerves, and\r\ncaused a predisposition to catarrh, gout, and other disorders, owing\r\nto which Fagon, the King's physician, had forbidden them to his royal\r\nmaster.[145]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS XIV.\r\n\r\n(From a portrait of the time).]\r\n\r\nShocked at these scandalous assertions, the entire Faculty of Medicine\r\nat the Reims University rose in arms in defence of their native\r\nvintage. Its periwigged professors put their learned heads together\r\nto discuss the all-important question, 'Is the wine of Reims more\r\nagreeable and more wholesome than the wine of Burgundy?' and in\r\n1700 Giles Culotteau embodied their combined opinions in a pamphlet\r\npublished under that title.[146] After extolling the liquid purity, the\r\nexcellent brightness, the divine flavour, the paradisiacal perfume,\r\nand the great durability of the wines of Ay, Pierry, Verzy, Sillery,\r\nHautvillers, &c., as superior to those of any growth of Burgundy,\r\nhe instanced the case of a local Old Parr named Pierre Pieton, a\r\n_vigneron_ of Hautvillers, who had married at the age of 110, and\r\nreached that of 118 without infirmity, as a convincing proof of the\r\nmaterial advantages reaped from their consumption.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT TOWER OF REIMS UNIVERSITY.]\r\n\r\nSalins, the _doyen_ of the Faculty of Medicine of Beaune, was intrusted\r\nwith the task of replying, and in 1704 bitterly assailed Culotteau's\r\nthesis in a 'Defence of the Wine of Burgundy against the Wine of\r\nChampagne,' which ran to five editions in four years. M. le Pescheur,\r\na doctor of Reims, vigorously attacked each of these editions in\r\nsuccession, maintaining amongst other things that the wine of Reims\r\nowed its renown to the many virtues discovered in it by the great lords\r\nwho had accompanied Louis XIV. to his coronation; and that if the King,\r\non the advice of his doctors, had renounced its use, his courtiers had\r\ncertainly not. He also asserted that England, Germany, and the North of\r\nEurope consumed far more Champagne than they did Burgundy, and that it\r\nwould be transported without risk to the end of the world, Tavernier\r\nhaving taken it to Persia, and another traveller to Siam and Surinam.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe partisanship quickly spread throughout the country, and the\r\nrespective admirers of Burgundy and Champagne pitilessly pelted each\r\nother in prose and verse; for the two camps had their troubadours, who,\r\nlike those of old, excited the courage and ardour of the combatants.\r\nThe first to sound the warlike trumpet was Benigné Grenan, professor\r\nat the college of Harcourt, who, with the rich vintage of his native\r\nprovince bubbling at fever-heat through his veins, sought in 1711 to\r\ncrush Champagne by means of Latin sapphics, a sample of which has been\r\nthus translated:\r\n\r\n    'Lift to the skies thy foaming wine,\r\n        That cheers the heart, that charms the eye;\r\n    Exalt its fragrance, gift divine,\r\n        Champagne, from thee the wise must fly!\r\n\r\n    A poison lurks those charms below,\r\n        An asp beneath the flowers is hid;\r\n    In vain thy sparkling fountains flow\r\n        When wisdom has their lymph forbid.\r\n\r\n    'Tis, but when cloyed with purer fair\r\n        We can with such a traitress flirt;\r\n    So following Beaune with reverent air,\r\n        Let Reims appear but at dessert.'[147]\r\n\r\nThe gauntlet thus contemptuously thrown down was promptly and\r\nindignantly picked up by the Rector of the University of Beauvais, the\r\nlearned Dr. Charles Coffin, a native of Buzancy, near Reims, who in\r\nthe quiet retirement of the Picardian _Alma Mater_ had evidently not\r\nforgotten to keep up his acquaintance with the vintage of his native\r\nprovince. The Latin poem he produced in reply, under the title of\r\n_Campania vindicata_,[148] had nothing in common with his lugubriously\r\nsepulchral name, as may be seen by the following somewhat freely\r\ntranslated extracts from it. After invoking the aid of a bottle of the\r\nenlivening liquor whose praises he is about to sing, he exclaims:\r\n\r\n    'As the vine, although lowly in aspect, outshines\r\n        The stateliest trees by the produce it bears,\r\n    So midst all earth's list of rich generous wines,\r\n        Our Reims the bright crown of preëminence wears.\r\n\r\n    The Massica, erst sang by Horace of old,\r\n        To Sillery now must abandon the field;\r\n    Falernian, nor Chian, could ne'er be so bold\r\n        To rival the nectar Ay's sunny slopes yield.\r\n\r\n    As bright as the goblet it sparklingly fills\r\n        With diamonds in fusion, it foaming exhales\r\n    An odour ambrosial, the nostril that thrills,\r\n        Foretelling the flavour delicious it veils.\r\n\r\n    At first with false fury the foam-bells arise,\r\n        And creamily bubbling spread over the brim,\r\n    Till equally swiftly their petulance dies\r\n        In a purity that makes e'en crystal seem dim.'[149]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nPraising the flavour of this nectar, which he declares is in every way\r\nworthy of its appearance, he stoutly defends the wine from the charge\r\nof unwholesomeness adduced against it by Grenan:\r\n\r\n    'Despite the tongue of malice,\r\n    No poison in thy chalice\r\n      Was ever found, Champagne!\r\n    Simplicity most loyal\r\n    Was e'er thy boast right royal,\r\n      And this thy wines retain.\r\n    No harm lurks in the fire\r\n    That helps thee to inspire\r\n      The heart and spur the brain.'[150]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSo far from causing inconvenience, he claims for Champagne the property\r\nof keeping off both gout and gravel, neither of which, he says, is\r\nknown in Reims and its neighbourhood, and continues:\r\n\r\n    'When on the fruit-piled board,\r\n    Thy cups, with nectar stored,\r\n      Commence their genial reign,\r\n    The wisest, sternest faces\r\n    Of mirth display the traces,\r\n      And to rejoice are fain.\r\n    As laughter's silv'ry ripple\r\n    Greets every glass we tipple.\r\n      Away fly grief and pain.'[151]\r\n\r\nThe jovial old rector with the sepulchral appellation then proceeds,\r\naccording to the most approved method of warfare, to carry the campaign\r\ninto the enemy's territory. He admits the nutritive and strengthening\r\nproperties of Burgundy, but demands what it possesses beyond these,\r\nwhich are shared in common with it by many other vintages. He then\r\nprophesies, with the return of peace,[152] the advent of the English to\r\nbuy the wine of Reims; and concludes by wishing that all who dispute\r\nthe merits of Champagne may find nothing to drink but the sour cider\r\nof Normandy or the acrid vintage of Ivri. The citizens of Reims,\r\nthoroughly alive to the importance of the controversy, were enchanted\r\nwith this production; they did not, however, crown the poet with\r\nlaurel, but more wisely and appropriately despatched to him four dozen\r\nof their best red and gray wines, by the aid of which he continued to\r\ntipple and to sing.\r\n\r\nGrenan, resuming the offensive in turn, at once addressed an epistle\r\nin Latin verse, in favour of Burgundy against Champagne, to Fagon, the\r\nKing's physician.[153] Complaining that the latter wine lays claim\r\nunjustly to the first rank, he allows it certain qualities--brilliancy,\r\npurity, limpidity, a subtle savour that touches the most blunted\r\npalate, and an aroma so delicious that it is impossible to resist its\r\nattractions. But he objects to its pretensions.\r\n\r\n    'Its vinous flood, with swelling pride\r\n        In foaming wavelets welling up,\r\n    Pours forth its bright and sparkling tide,\r\n        Bubbling and glittering in the cup.'[154]\r\n\r\nHe goes on to accuse the Champenois poet of being unduly inspired by\r\nthis wine, the effects of which he finds apparent in his inflated style\r\nand his attempts to place Champagne in the first rank, and make all\r\nother vintages its subjects; and he reiterates his allegations that,\r\nunlike Burgundy, it affects both the head and the stomach, and is bound\r\nto produce gout and gravel in its systematic imbibers. He concludes by\r\nbegging Fagon to pronounce in his favour, as having proved the virtues\r\nof Burgundy on the King himself, whose strength had been sustained by\r\nit. The retort was sharp and to the point, taking the form of a twofold\r\nepigram from an anonymous hand:\r\n\r\n    'To the doctor to go\r\n        On behalf of your wine\r\n    Is, as far as I know,\r\n        Of its sickness a sign.\r\n\r\n    Your cause and your wine\r\n        Must be equally weak,\r\n    Since to check their decline\r\n        A prescription you seek.'[155]\r\n\r\nNor was the poet of the funereal cognomen backward in stepping into the\r\nfield; for he published a metrical decree, supposed to be issued by the\r\nfaculty of the island of Cos in the fourth year of the ninety-first\r\nOlympiad,[156] in which, though a verdict is nominally given in favour\r\nof Burgundy, Grenan's pleas on behalf of this wine are treated with\r\nwithering sarcasm.\r\n\r\nBut whilst these enthusiastic partisans thus belaboured one another,\r\nthere were not wanting impartial spirits who could recognise that there\r\nwere merits on both sides. Bellechaume, in an ode jointly addressed to\r\nthe two combatants,[157] adjures them to live at peace on Parnassus,\r\nand, remembering that Horace praised both Falernian and Massica, to\r\njointly animate their muse with Champagne and Burgundy:\r\n\r\n    'To learn the difference between\r\n        The wine of Reims and that of Beaune,\r\n    The fairest plan would be, I ween,\r\n        To drink them both, not one alone.'[158]\r\n\r\nAnother equally judicious versifier called also on the Burgundian\r\nchampion[159] to cease the futile contest, since\r\n\r\n    'Bold Burgundian ever glories\r\n        With stout Remois to get mellow;\r\n    Each well filled with vinous lore is\r\n        Each a jolly tippling fellow.'[160]\r\n\r\nAnd the learned Canon Maucroix of Reims exhibited a similar\r\nconciliatory spirit in the ingenious parallel which he drew between\r\nthe two greatest orators of antiquity and the wines of the Marne\r\nand the Côte d'Or. 'In the wine of Burgundy,' he observes, 'there\r\nis more strength and vigour; it does not play with its man so much,\r\nit overthrows him more suddenly,--that is Demosthenes. The wine of\r\nChampagne is subtler and more delicate; it amuses more and for a\r\nlonger time, but in the end it does not produce less effect,--that is\r\nCicero.'[161]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMAINS OF THE GATE OF BACCHUS, NEAR REIMS UNIVERSITY.]\r\n\r\nThe national disasters which marked the close of the reign of Louis\r\nXIV. diverted public attention in some degree from the nugatory\r\ncontest;[162] and though Fontenelle sought to prove that a glass of\r\nChampagne was better than a bottle of Burgundy,[163] the impartially\r\nappreciative agreed with Panard that\r\n\r\n    'Old Burgundy and young Champagne\r\n    At table boast an equal reign.'[164]\r\n\r\nBut the doctors continued to disagree, and new generations of them\r\nstill went on wrangling over the vexed questions of supremacy and\r\nsalubrity. In 1739 Jean François carried the war into the enemy's camp\r\nby maintaining at Paris that Burgundy caused gout; and a little later\r\nRobert Linguet declared the wine of Reims to be as healthy as it was\r\nagreeable. In 1777 Xavier, Regent of the Faculty of Medicine at the\r\nReims University, affirmed that not only did the once vilified _vin\r\nmousseux_ share with the other wines of the Champagne the absence of\r\nthe tartarous particles which in many red wines are productive of\r\ngout and gravel, but that the gas it contained caused it to act as a\r\ndissolvent upon stone in the human body, and was also invaluable, from\r\nits antiseptic qualities, in treating putrid fevers.[165] Further,\r\nthe appropriately named Champagne Dufresnay established, to his own\r\nsatisfaction and that of his colleagues, that the wine was superior to\r\nany other growth, native or foreign.[166] At length, in 1778, when the\r\nbones of the original disputants were dust, and their lancets rust, on\r\nthe occasion of a thesis being defended before the Faculty of Medicine\r\nof Paris, a verdict was formally pronounced by this body in favour of\r\nthe wine of the Champagne.[167]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                  V.\r\n\r\n           /Progress and Popularity of Sparkling Champagne./\r\n\r\n    Sparkling Champagne intoxicates the Regent d'Orléans and the\r\n    _roués_ of the Palais Royal--It is drunk by Peter the Great at\r\n    Reims--A horse trained on Champagne and biscuits--Decree of Louis\r\n    XV. regarding the transport of Champagne--Wine for the _petits\r\n    cabinets du Roi_--The _petits soupers_ and Champagne orgies of\r\n    the royal household--A bibulous royal mistress--The Well-Beloved\r\n    at Reims--Frederick the Great, George II., Stanislas Leczinski,\r\n    and Marshal Saxe all drink Champagne--Voltaire sings the praises\r\n    of the effervescing wine of Ay--The Commander Descartes and\r\n    Lebatteux extol the charms of sparkling Champagne--Bertin\r\n    du Rocheret and his balsamic molecules--The Bacchanalian\r\n    poet Panard chants the inspiring effects of the vintages of\r\n    the Marne--Marmontel is jointly inspired by Mademoiselle de\r\n    Navarre and the wine of Avenay--The Abbé de l'Attaignant and\r\n    his fair hostesses--Breakages of bottles in the manufacturers'\r\n    cellars--Attempts to obviate them--The early sparkling wines\r\n    merely _crémant_--_Saute bouchon_ and _demi-mousseux_--Prices\r\n    of Champagne in the eighteenth century--Preference given to\r\n    light acid wines for sparkling Champagne--Lingering relics\r\n    of prejudice against _vin mousseux_--The secret addition of\r\n    sugar--Originally the wine not cleared in bottle--Its transfer\r\n    to other bottles necessary--Adoption of the present method\r\n    of ridding the wine of its deposit--The vine-cultivators the\r\n    last to profit by the popularity of sparkling Champagne--Marie\r\n    Antoinette welcomed to Reims--Reception and coronation of Louis\r\n    XVI. at Reims--'The crown, it hurts me!'--Oppressive dues and\r\n    tithes of the _ancien régime_--The Fermiers Généraux and their\r\n    hôtel at Reims--Champagne under the Revolution--Napoleon at\r\n    Epernay--Champagne included in the equipment of his satraps--The\r\n    Allies in the Champagne--Drunkenness and pillaging--Appreciation\r\n    of Champagne by the invading troops--The beneficial results which\r\n    followed--Universal popularity of Champagne--The wine a favourite\r\n    with kings and potentates--Its traces to be met with everywhere.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhilst doctors went on shaking their periwigged heads, and debating\r\nwhether sparkling Champagne did or did not injure the nerves and\r\nproduce gout, the timid might hearken to their counsels, but there were\r\nplenty of spirits bold enough to let the corks pop gaily, regardless of\r\nall consequences. The wine continued in high favour with the _viveurs_\r\nof the capital, and especially with the brilliant band of titled\r\nscoundrels who formed the Court of Philippe le Débonnaire. 'When my son\r\ngets drunk,' wrote, on the 13th August 1716, the Princess Charlotte\r\nElizabeth of Bavaria, the Regent's mother, 'it is not with strong\r\ndrinks or spirituous liquors, but pure wine of Champagne;'[168] and\r\nas the pupil of the Abbé Dubois very seldom went to bed sober,[169]\r\nhe must have consumed a fair amount of the fluid in question in the\r\ncourse of his career. Even his boon companion, the Duke de Richelieu,\r\nis forced to admit that there was a great deal more drunkenness about\r\nhim than was becoming in a Regent of France; and that, as he could not\r\nsupport wine so well as his guests, he often rose from the table drunk,\r\nor with his wits wool-gathering. 'Two bottles of Champagne,' remarks\r\nthe duke in his _Chronique_, 'had this effect upon him.'\r\n\r\nDesirous, seemingly, that such enjoyments should not be confined to\r\nhimself alone, he abolished in 1719 sundry dues on wine in general,\r\nwhilst his famous, or rather infamous, suppers conduced to the vogue\r\nof that sparkling Champagne which was an indispensable accompaniment\r\nof those _décolleté_ repasts. It unloosed the tongues and waistcoats\r\nof the _roués_ of the Palais Royal, the Nocés, Broglios, Birons,\r\nBrancas, and Canillacs; it lent an additional sparkle to the bright\r\neyes of Mesdames de Parabère and de Sabran, and inspired the scathing\r\nremark from the lips of one of those fair frail ones, that 'God, after\r\nhaving made man, took up a little mud, and used it to form the souls of\r\nprinces and lackeys.' It played its part, too, at the memorable repast\r\nat which the Regent and his favourite daughter so scandalised their\r\nhostess, the Duchess of Burgundy, and at the fatal orgie shared by the\r\nsame pair on the terrace of Meudon.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE REGENT D'ORLÉANS (From the picture by Santerre).]\r\n\r\nThe example set in such high quarters could not fail to be followed.\r\nChampagne fired the sallies of the wits and versifiers whom the Duchess\r\nof Maine gathered around her at Sceaux, and stimulated the madness\r\nwhich seized upon the whole of Paris at the bidding of the financier\r\nLaw. It frothed, too, in the goblets which Bertin du Rocheret had\r\nthe honour of filling with his own hand for Peter the Great, on the\r\npassage of the Northern Colossus through Reims in June 1717; and\r\nits consumption was increased by a decree of 1728, which especially\r\nprovided that people proceeding to their country seats might take with\r\nthem for their own use a certain quantity of this wine free of duty.\r\n\r\nA curious purpose to which the wine was applied appeared from a wager\r\nlaid by the Count de Saillans--one of the most famous horsemen of his\r\nday, and already distinguished by similar feats--to the effect that he\r\nwould ride a single horse from the gate of Versailles to the Hôtel des\r\nInvalides within an hour. His wife, fearing the dangerous descent from\r\nSèvres towards Paris, prevailed on the King to prohibit him from riding\r\nin person; but a valet, whose neck was of course of no moment, was\r\nallowed to act as his deputy in essaying the feat. The horse selected\r\nwas carefully fed for some days beforehand on biscuits and Champagne.\r\nCrowds assembled to witness the attempt, which was made on May 9, 1725,\r\nand resulted in the valet's coming in two and a half minutes behind\r\ntime. Whether this was due to the badness of the roads, as was alleged,\r\nor to the singular _régime_ adopted for the animal selected, remains a\r\nmoot question.[170]\r\n\r\nChampagne won equal favour in the eyes of Louis XV., as in those\r\nof the curious compound of embodied vices who had watched over the\r\nwelfare of the kingdom during his minority, though it is true that at a\r\ncomparatively early age--in the year 1731--he had, on representations\r\nthat over-production of wine was lowering its value, prohibited the\r\nplanting of fresh vineyards without his permission under a penalty of\r\n3000 francs, and had renewed this prohibition the year following.[171]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS XV. WHEN YOUNG\r\n\r\n(From a picture of the epoch).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A FRENCH COUNTRY INN OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n(From the 'Routes de France').]\r\n\r\nThe royal repasts at La Muette, Marly, and Choissy were, however,\r\nenlivened with wine from the Champagne; for we find Bertin du Rocheret\r\nin 1738 despatching thirty pieces of the still wine to M. de Castagnet\r\nfor the _petits cabinets du Roi_,[172] and the eldest of the fair\r\nsisters La Nesle, Madame de Mailly, the 'Queen of Choissy' and\r\n_maîtresse en titre_, in 1740 reforming the cellar management, and\r\nsuppressing the _petits soupers_ and Champagne orgies of the royal\r\nhousehold.[173] Her conduct in this respect seems, however, not to\r\nhave been dictated by motives of virtue, but rather by the conviction\r\nthat the wine was too precious to be consumed by inferiors. We are\r\nassured that the countess loved wine, and above all that of Champagne,\r\nand that she could hold her own against the stoutest toper. 'She has\r\nbeen reproached with having imparted this taste to the King, but it is\r\nprobable that his Majesty was naturally inclined that way.'[174]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UN PETIT SOUPER OF THE EIGHTEENTH CENTURY\r\n\r\n(From the collection of the 'Chansons de Laborde').]\r\n\r\nWhen, in 1741, the 'Well-Beloved' passed through Reims, Dom Chatelain,\r\nafter rejoicing over the year's vintage having been a very fine one,\r\nadds that it was drunk to a considerable extent and with the greatest\r\njoy in the world during the ten days that the King remained in the\r\ncity. 'It was no longer a question,' he exclaims exultingly, 'of\r\nsending for Burgundy or Laon wine.' Three years later, when traversing\r\nthe Champagne, on his way to Metz, he again halted at Reims; and after\r\nhearing mass, 'retired to the Archevêché, where the Corps de la Ville\r\npresented his Majesty with the wines of the town, which he ordered\r\nto be taken to his apartments.'[175] Wine was also presented to the\r\nPrince de Soubise, Governor of the Champagne; the Duke de Villeroy, M.\r\nd'Argenson, and the Count de Joyeuse; whilst, for the benefit of the\r\npopulace, four fountains of the same fluid flowed at the corners of the\r\nPlace de l'Hôtel de Ville.[176] In like manner, at the inauguration of\r\nthat 'brazen lie,' the statue of this same Louis XV., in 1767, wine\r\nflowed in rivers from the different fountains of the city.[177]\r\n\r\nThe satyr-like sovereign of France was by no means the only monarch\r\nof his time who appreciated sparkling Champagne. Frederick the Great\r\nhas praised its consoling powers in the doggerel which Voltaire was\r\nengaged to turn into poetry; and George II. of England at St. James's,\r\nand Stanislas Leczinski of Poland at Nancy, both quaffed of the\r\nsame vintage of Ay despatched in 1754 from the cellars of Bertin du\r\nRocheret. Marshal Saxe, during his sojourn in 1745 at Brussels, where\r\nhe held a quasi-royal court, of which Mademoiselle de Navarre was the\r\nbright particular star, drew an ample supply of Champagne from the\r\ncellars of that lady's father, Claude Hevin de Navarre of Avenay, who\r\nhad established himself as a wine merchant in the Belgian capital.[178]\r\nDespite, too, the continued outcry of some connoisseurs,[179] the\r\n_vin mousseux_ became the universal source of inspiration for the\r\ncabaret-haunting poets of that graceless witty epoch.[180] Voltaire,\r\nall unmoved by the excellent still Champagne with which he and the Duke\r\nde Richelieu had been regaled at Epernay by Bertin du Rocheret in May\r\n1735, persisted in singing the praises of the effervescing wine of Ay,\r\nin the sparkling foam of which he professed to find the type of the\r\nFrench nation:[181]\r\n\r\n    'Chloris and Eglé, with their snowy hands,\r\n    Pour out a wine of Ay, whose prisoned foam,\r\n    Tightly compressed within its crystal home,\r\n    Drives out the cork; 'midst laughter's joyous sound\r\n    It flies, against the ceiling to rebound.\r\n    The sparkling foam of this refreshing wine\r\n    The brilliant image of us French does shine.'\r\n\r\nThe Commander Descartes seems not to have been afraid to extol the\r\ncharms of the sparkling wine to the younger Bertin du Rocheret, as\r\nstern a decrier of its merits as his father had previously been. In a\r\nletter dated December 1735, asking for 'one or two dozen bottles of\r\nsparkling white wine, neither _vert_ nor _liquoreux_, \"I should like,\"\r\nhe says, \"some\r\n\r\n    Of that delectable white wine\r\n        Which foams and sparkles in the glass,\r\n        And seldom mortal lips does pass;\r\n    But cheers, at festivals divine,\r\n        The gods to whom it owes its birth,\r\n        Or else the great, our gods on earth.\"'[182]\r\n\r\nAmongst other versifiers of this epoch enamoured with the merits of the\r\nwine may be cited Charles Lebatteux, professor of rhetoric at Reims\r\nUniversity, who in 1739 composed an ode, 'In Civitatem Remensam,'\r\ncontaining the following invocation to Bacchus:\r\n\r\n    ''Tis not on the icy-topped mountains of Thrace,\r\n    Or those of Rhodope, thy favours I trace--\r\n        Not there to invoke thee I'd roam.\r\n    No! Reims sees thee reign sovereign lord o'er her hills;\r\n    There I offer my vows, and the nectar that thrills\r\n        To my soul I will seek close at home.\r\n\r\n    Whether Venus-like rising midst foam sparkling white,\r\n    Or wrapped in a mantle of rose rich and bright,\r\n        Thou seekest my senses to fire,\r\n    Come aid me to sing, for my Muse is full fain\r\n    To owe on this day each melodious strain\r\n        To the fervour 'tis thine to inspire.'[183]\r\n\r\nBertin du Rocheret, who by no means shared his friend Voltaire's\r\nadmiration for the sparkling vintage of Ay, sang the praises of the\r\nstill wine of the Champagne after the following fashion in 1741:\r\n\r\n    'No, such blockheads do not sip\r\n        Of that most delicious wine;\r\n    Soul of love and fellowship,\r\n        Sweet as truly 'tis benign.\r\n    No, their palate, spoilt and worn,\r\n        Craves adult'rate juice to drain;\r\n    Poison raw which we should scorn,\r\n        Beverage fit for frantic brain.\r\n    Let us, therefore, hold as fools\r\n        Such as now feign to despise\r\n    Those _balsamic molecules_\r\n        Horace used to sing and prize.\r\n\r\n    No, such blockheads do not sip\r\n        Of that most delicious wine;\r\n    Soul of joy and fellowship,\r\n        Sweet as truly 'tis benign.\r\n    Of that wine, so purely white,\r\n        Which the sternest mood makes pass,\r\n    And which sparkles yet more bright\r\n        In your eyes than in my glass.\r\n    Drink, then, drink; I pledge you, dear,\r\n        In the nectar old we prize;\r\n    Sparkling in our glasses clear,\r\n        But more brightly in your eyes.'[184]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nMarmontel, the author of _Bélisaire_ and editor of the _Mercure de\r\nFrance_, found inspiration in his youthful days in the sparkling wine\r\nof Champagne. He describes, in somewhat fatuous style, the results of\r\nan invitation he received from Mademoiselle de Navarre to pass some\r\nmonths with her in 1746 at Avenay, where her father owned several\r\nvineyards, and where, she added, 'It will be very unfortunate if with\r\nme and some excellent vin de Champagne you do not produce good verses.'\r\nHe tells how, in stormy weather, she insisted, on account of her fear\r\nof lightning, on dining in the cellars, where, 'in the midst of fifty\r\nthousand bottles of Champagne, it was difficult not to lose one's\r\nhead;' and how he was accustomed to read to her the verses thus jointly\r\ninspired when seated together on a wooded hillock, rising amidst the\r\nvineyards of Avenay.[185]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing in some degree recalls the circumstances under which\r\nGluck, whose fame began to be established about this epoch, was\r\naccustomed to seek his musical inspirations. The celebrated composer of\r\n_Orpheus_ and _Iphegenia in Aulis_ was wont, when desirous of a visit\r\nfrom the 'divine afflatus,' to seat himself in the midst of a flowery\r\nmeadow with a couple of bottles of Champagne by his side. By the time\r\nthese were emptied, the air he was in search of was discovered and\r\nwritten down.\r\n\r\nThe lively and good-humoured Abbé de l'Attaignant, whose occupations\r\nas a canon of Reims Cathedral seem to have allowed him an infinite\r\nquantity of spare time to devote to versifying, addressed some rather\r\nindifferent rhymes to Madame de Blagny on the cork of a bottle of\r\nChampagne exploding in her hand;[186] and in some lines to Madame de\r\nBoulogne, on her pouring out Champagne for him at table, he maintains\r\nthat the nectar poured out by Ganymede to Jupiter at his repasts must\r\nyield to this vintage.[187]\r\n\r\nThat boon convivialist Panard--who flourished at the same epoch, and\r\nwas one of the chief songsters of the original Caveau, and a man of\r\nwhom it was said that, 'when set running, the tide of song flowed on\r\ntill the cask was empty'--has not neglected sparkling Champagne in\r\nhis Bacchanalian compositions. The 'La Fontaine of Vaudeville,' as\r\nMarmontel dubbed him, does not hesitate to admit that he preferred\r\nthe popping of Champagne corks to the martial strains of drum and\r\ntrumpet.[188] The wine, moreover, furnishes him with frequent\r\nillustrations for his code of careless philosophy.\r\n\r\n    'Doctor for vintner vials fills\r\n        Most carefully, with lymph of wells.\r\n    Champagne, that grew on Nanterre's hills,\r\n        Vintner in turn to doctor sells.\r\n    So still we find, as on we jog\r\n    Throughout the world, 'tis dog bite dog.'[189]\r\n\r\nElsewhere Panard gives expression to the Bacchanalian sentiment, which\r\nhe seems to have made his rule of life, in the following terms:\r\n\r\n    'Let's quit this vain world, with its pleasures that cloy,\r\n    A destiny tranquil and sweet to enjoy:\r\n        Descend to my cellar, and there taste the charms\r\n    Of Champagne and Beaune;\r\n        Our pleasure will there be without the alarms\r\n        Of any joy queller;\r\n    For the _ennui_ that often mounts up to the throne\r\n        Will never descend to the cellar.'[190]\r\n\r\nThe poet appears to have rivalled one of the characters in his piece,\r\n_Les Festes Sincères_ (represented on the 5th October 1744 on the\r\noccasion of the King's convalescence), who, after describing how wine\r\nwas freely proffered to all comers, said that he had contented himself\r\nwith thirty glasses, 'half Burgundy and half Champagne.'\r\n\r\nIn a piece of verse entitled 'La Charme du Vaudeville à Table,' Panard\r\nsketches in glowing colours the inspiriting effect of sparkling\r\nChampagne upon such a joyous company of periwigged beaux and patched\r\nand powdered beauties as we may imagine to be assembled at the\r\nhospitable board of some rich financier of the epoch.\r\n\r\n          ''Tis then some joyous guest\r\n          A flask, filled with the best\r\n    Of Reims or Ay, securely sealed, holds up;\r\n          He deftly cuts the string,\r\n          Aloft the cork takes wing;\r\n          The rest with eager eyes\r\n          Thrust glasses t'wards the prize,\r\n    And watch the nectar foaming o'er the cup.\r\n\r\n          They sip, they drink, they laugh,\r\n          And then anew they quaff\r\n    Their bumpers, crowned above the brim with foam\r\n          That gives to laughter birth,\r\n          And makes fresh bursts of mirth.\r\n          Its spirit and its fire\r\n          Unto the brain aspire,\r\n    And rouse the wit of which this is the home.'[191]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nTo its praise he also devotes a poetic _tour de force_, the concluding\r\nverses of which may thus be rendered:\r\n\r\n    'Thanks to the bowl\r\n    That cheers my soul,\r\n        No care can make me shrink.\r\n    The foam divine\r\n    Of this gray wine,[192]\r\n        I think,\r\n\r\n    When it I drain,\r\n    Gives to each vein\r\n        A link.\r\n    Source of pure joy,\r\n    Without alloy,\r\n        Come, dear one, fain I'd drink!\r\n\r\n    Divine Champagne,\r\n    All grief and pain\r\n        In thee I gladly sink.\r\n    All ills agree\r\n    Away from thee\r\n        To slink.\r\n\r\n    Sweet to the nose\r\n    As new-blown rose\r\n        Or pink.\r\n    With gifts that ease\r\n    And charms that please,\r\n        Come, dear one, fain I'd drink!'[193]\r\n\r\nDespite the success achieved by the _vin mousseux_, merchants, owing to\r\nthe excessive breakage of the bottles--of the cause of which and of the\r\nmeans of stopping it they were equally ignorant--often saw their hopes\r\nof fortune fly away with the splintered fragments of the shattered\r\nglass.[194] The following passages from the /MS./ notes of the founder\r\nof one of the first houses of Reims, written in 1770, would imply\r\nsome knowledge of the fact that a _liquoreux_ wine was likely to lead\r\nto a destructive _casse_, and also that the importance of the trade\r\nin sparkling Champagne was far greater during the first half of the\r\neighteenth century than is usually supposed.[195] The /MS./ in question\r\nsays: 'In 1746 I bottled 6000 bottles of a very _liquoreux_ wine; I\r\nhad only 120 bottles of it left. In 1747 there was less _liqueur_; the\r\nbreakage amounted to one-third of the whole. In 1748 it was more vinous\r\nand less _liquoreux_; the breakage was only a sixth. In 1759 it was\r\nmore _rond_, and the breakage was only a tenth. In 1766 the wine of\r\nJacquelet was very _rond_; the breakage was only a twentieth.'[196]\r\n\r\nThe writer then proceeds to recommend, as a means of preventing\r\nbreakage, that the wine should not be bottled till the _liqueur_\r\nhad almost disappeared, and that, if necessary, fermentation should\r\nbe checked by well beating the wine. But as at that epoch there was\r\nreally no means of effectually testing this disappearance, and as the\r\nbeating theory was an utterly fallacious one, the followers of his\r\nprecepts remained with the sad alternative of producing in too many\r\ninstances either _mousses folles_ and their inevitable accompaniment of\r\ndisastrous breakage, or wine so mature as to be incapable of continuing\r\nits fermentation in bottle, and producing _mousse_ at all.[197]\r\n\r\nIt is therefore evident that much of the sparkling wine drunk at the\r\ncommencement of the last century was what we should call _crémant_, or,\r\nas it was then styled, _sablant_,[198] as otherwise the breakage would\r\nhave been something frightful. Bertin du Rocheret plainly indicates\r\nafter 1730 a difference between the fiercely frothing kinds, to which\r\nthe term _saute bouchon_ or pop-cork was applied, and wine that was\r\nmerely _mousseux_.[199] The price of the former is the highest, ranging\r\nup to 3 livres 6 sols, whilst that of the _bon mousseux_ does not\r\nexceed 50 sols, the difference in the two being no doubt based to a\r\ncertain extent on the loss by breakage.[200]\r\n\r\nHence, too, a partiality for weak sour growths for making _vin\r\nmousseux_, as, although science could give no reason, experience\r\nshowed that with these the breakage would be less than with those of a\r\nsaccharine nature.[201] Thus Bertin writes in 1744 that the vineyards\r\nof Avize, planted for the most part in 1715, and almost entirely with\r\nwhite grapes, only produced a thin wine, with a tartness that caused\r\nit to be one of the least esteemed in the district; but that 'since\r\nthe mania for the _saute bouchon_, that abominable beverage, which has\r\nbecome yet more loathsome from an insupportable acidity,' the Avize\r\nwines had increased in value eightfold.[202] To this acidity the Abbé\r\nBignon refers in a poem of 1741, in which, protesting against the\r\npartiality for violently effervescing wines, he says:\r\n\r\n    'Your palate is a cripple\r\n    Worn out by fiery tipple,\r\n    Or else it would prefer juice\r\n    Of grapes to fizzing verjuice.'[203]\r\n\r\nThis serves to explain the preference so long accorded by _gourmets_ to\r\nthe finer _non mousseux_ wines, full of aroma and flavour, and often\r\nsugary and _liquoreux_, but looked upon by the general public up to the\r\nclose of the eighteenth century as inferior to those which were sharp,\r\nstrong, and even sourish, but which effervesced well.[204] Lingering\r\nrelics of prejudice against sparkling wine existed as late as 1782,\r\nwhen that conscientious observer, Legrand d'Aussy, remarked that since\r\nit had been known that sparkling wines were green wines bottled in\r\nspring, when the universal revolution of Nature causes them to enter\r\ninto fermentation, they had not been so much esteemed, the _gourmets_\r\nof that day preferring those which did not sparkle.[205]\r\n\r\nIt was not till the close of the eighteenth century that any attempt\r\nwas openly made to improve sparkling Champagne by the addition of\r\nsugar.[206] Science then came forward to prove that such an addition\r\nwas not contrary to the nature of wine, and that fermentation converted\r\nthe saccharine particles of the must into alcohol, and increased the\r\nvinosity.[207] Several growers began to profit by this discovery of\r\nChaptal, though, as a rule, those who followed his recommendations in\r\nsecret were loudest in asserting that Providence alone had rendered\r\ntheir wine better than that of their neighbours.[208] M. Nicolas\r\nPerrier of Epernay, an ex-monk of Prémontré, pointed out, at the\r\nbeginning of the present century, that up to that period sugar was\r\nonly regarded as a means of rendering the wine more pleasant to drink,\r\nand had always been added after fermentation, and as late as possible.\r\nThis practice was favoured by the tyrannical routine reigning among\r\nthe peasants of not tasting the wine till December or January, when in\r\n1800 a decisive experience confirmed the value of the new discoveries.\r\nNumerous demands for wine during the vintage led to anticipations of\r\na brisk and speedy sale, and sugar was thereupon added at the time of\r\nthe first fermentation, merely with the view, however, of bringing the\r\nwine more forward for the buyer to taste. The result went beyond the\r\nexpectations entertained; and at Ay wines of the second class, commonly\r\ncalled _vins de vignerons_, rose to a price previously unheard of.[209]\r\n\r\nThe present system of clearing the wine in bottles was not practised\r\nformerly. People were then not so particular about its perfect\r\nlimpidity; besides which the wine consumed at the beginning of the\r\nyear[210] had not time to deposit, and that bottled as _mousseux_,\r\nowing to its being originally made from carefully-selected grapes,\r\nformed very little sediment in the flask.[211] The method of _collage_\r\nemployed at the Abbey of Hautvillers is said to have preserved the\r\nwines from this evil. Whether this method transpired, or other people\r\ndiscovered it, is unknown; but certainly Bertin du Rocheret transmitted\r\nit, or something very similar, in July 1752 to his correspondent in\r\nLondon, who bottled Champagne wines regularly every year.[212]\r\n\r\nThe necessity of ridding the wine of the deposit which deprived it of\r\nits limpidity was, however, recognised later on. At first no other\r\nmethod suggested itself, excepting to _dépoter_ it--that is, to decant\r\nit into another bottle; a plan fraught, in the case of sparkling wines,\r\nwith several disadvantages. At the commencement of the present century,\r\nhowever, the system of _dégorgeage_ was substituted.[213] As at first\r\npractised, each bottle was held neck downwards, and either shaken\r\nor tapped at the bottom to detach the sediment, the operation being\r\nconstantly repeated until the deposit had settled in the neck, when it\r\nwas driven out by the force of the explosion which followed upon the\r\nremoval of the cork. Somewhat later the plan now followed of placing\r\nthe bottles in sloping racks and turning them every day was adopted, to\r\nthe great saving of time and labour. Its discovery has been popularly\r\nattributed to Madame Clicquot; but the fact is the suggestion emanated\r\nfrom a person in her employ named Müller. The idea is said to have\r\nsimultaneously occurred to a workman in Marizet's house of the name of\r\nThommassin.\r\n\r\nAlthough the advent of such a delectable beverage as sparkling\r\nChampagne proved of much benefit to the world in general, and the\r\nwine-merchants of Reims and Epernay in particular, those most\r\nimmediately concerned in its production had little or no reason to\r\nrejoice over its renown. The hapless peasants, from whose patches of\r\nvineyard it was to a great extent derived, were the last to profit by\r\nits popularity. Bidet, writing in 1759, foreshadows the misery which\r\nmarked the last thirty years of the _ancien régime_.[214] Speaking\r\nof the important trade in wine carried on by the city of Reims, he\r\nurges that this would in reality be benefited by the old decrees,\r\nprohibiting the planting of new vineyards in the Champagne, being\r\nenforced to the letter. Extensive plantations of vines in land suitable\r\nfor the growth of corn had doubled and even tripled the value of arable\r\nland, and caused a rise in the price of wheat. Manure, so necessary\r\nto bring these new plantations into bearing, and wood, owing to the\r\ndemand for vine-stakes, barrel-staves, &c., had risen to thrice their\r\nformer value. Recent epidemics had cost the lives of a large number\r\nof vine-dressers, and public _corvées_ occupied the survivors a great\r\npart of the year, and hence a considerable increase in the cost of\r\ncultivation, landowners having to pay high wages to labourers from\r\na distance. 'Putting together all these excessive charges, with the\r\ncrushing dues levied in addition upon vine-land as well as upon the\r\nsale and transport of wine, the result will infallibly be that the more\r\nprofitable the wine-trade formerly was to Reims and to the vineyards\r\nof the environs, the more it will languish in the end, till it becomes\r\na burden to all the vineyard owners.' Happily these gloomy forebodings\r\nhave since been completely falsified.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE ARMS OF REIMS ON THE PORTE DE PARIS.]\r\n\r\nReims accorded an enthusiastic welcome to the youthful and ill-fated\r\nMarie Antoinette, on her passage through the city on May 12, 1770,\r\nshortly after her arrival in France;[215] and five years subsequently\r\nthe Rémois were regaled with the splendours of a coronation, when\r\nthe young King, Louis XVI., and his radiant Queen passed beneath\r\nthe elaborately wrought escutcheon surmounting the Porte de\r\nParis, expressly forged by a blacksmith of Reims in honour of the\r\noccasion,[216] and received from the hands of the Lieutenant des\r\nHabitans the three silver keys of the city.[217] The King was crowned\r\non the 11th June by the Cardinal Archbishop of Reims, Charles Antoine\r\nde la Roche Aymon, a prelate who had previously baptised, confirmed,\r\nand married him, when the six lay peers were represented by Monsieur\r\n(the Count of Provence), the Count d'Artois, the Dukes of Orleans,\r\nChartres, and Bourbon, and the Prince de Condé. The royal train was\r\nborne by the Prince de Lambesq; the Marshal de Clermont Tonnerre\r\nofficiated as Constable; and the sceptre, crown, and hand of justice\r\nwere carried respectively by the Marshals de Contades, de Broglie,\r\nand de Nicolai.[218] How the ill-fated King exclaimed, as the crown\r\nof Charlemagne was placed upon his brow, 'It hurts me,' even as\r\nHenri III. had cried, under the same circumstances, 'It pricks me,'\r\nand how his natural benevolence led him to slur over that portion\r\nof the coronation oath in which he ought to have bound himself to\r\nexterminate all heretics, are matters of history. An innovation to\r\nbe noted is, that at the banquet at the archiepiscopal palace, after\r\nthe ceremony, the youthful sovereign did _not_ sit alone in solitary\r\nstate beneath a canopy of purple velvet, ornamented with golden fleurs\r\nde lis, with his table encumbered by the great gold _nef_, the crown\r\nand the sceptres, the Constable, sword in hand, close by him, and the\r\nGrand Echanson and Ecuyer Tranchant tasting his wine and cutting his\r\nfood,[219] circumstances under which 'the roast must be without savour\r\nand the Ai without bouquet.'[220] The King on this occasion admitted\r\nhis brothers to his board; and the ecclesiastical peers, the lay peers,\r\nthe ambassadors, and the great officers of the crown formed, as usual,\r\nfour groups at the remaining tables, whilst the Queen and her ladies\r\nwitnessed the gustatory exploits from a gallery.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LOUIS XVI. TAKING THE CORONATION OATH AT REIMS\r\n\r\n(From a painting by Moreau).]\r\n\r\nThe frightful oppression of _tailles_, _aides_, _corvées_,\r\n_gabelles_, and other dues that crushed the hapless peasant in the\r\npre-Revolutionary era, weighed with especial severity upon the\r\n_vigneron_. In virtue of the _droit de gros_, the officers could at any\r\nhour make an inventory of his wine, decree how much he might consume\r\nhimself, and tax him for the remainder.[221] The _fermiers généraux_,\r\nwho farmed the taxes of the province, became his sleeping partners,\r\nand had their share in his crop.[222] In a vineyard at Epernay, upon\r\nfour pieces of wine, the average produce of an arpent, and valued at\r\n600 francs, the _ferme_ levied first 30 francs, and then when the\r\npieces were sold 75 francs more.[223] The ecclesiastical tithe was also\r\na heavy burden, at Hautvillers the eleventh of the wine being taken\r\nas _dismes_, at Dizy the twelfth, and at Pierry the twentieth.[224]\r\nThe result was one continuous struggle of trickery on the part of the\r\ngrower, and cunning on that of the officers.[225] The visits of the\r\nlatter were paid almost daily, and their registers recorded every drop\r\nof wine in the cellars of the inhabitants.[226]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBut the wine had by no means acquitted all its dues. The merchant\r\nbuying it had to pay another 75 francs to the _ferme_ before\r\ndespatching it to the consumer. When he did despatch it, the _ferme_\r\nstrictly prescribed the route it was to take, any deviation from this\r\nbeing punished by confiscation; and it had to pay at almost every step.\r\nTransport by water was excessively onerous from constantly recurring\r\ntolls, and by land whole days were lost in undergoing examinations and\r\nverifications and making payments.[227] The commissionnaire charged\r\nwith the conveyance of Bertin du Rocheret's wine to Calais from Epernay\r\nhad from 70 to 75 francs per poinçon. Despite all these drawbacks, the\r\nexport trade must have been considerable, for we are told that prior to\r\nthe Revolution the profits on supplying two or three abbeys of Flanders\r\nwere sufficient to enable a wine-merchant of Reims to live in good\r\nstyle.[228]\r\n\r\nOn arriving at the town where it was to be drunk, the wine was subject\r\nto a fresh series of charges--_octroi_, _droit de détail_, _le billot_,\r\n_le cinquième en sus l'impôt_, _jaugeage_, _courtage_, _gourmettage_,\r\n&c.--frequently ranging up to 60 or 70 francs.[229] All this really\r\naffected the grower; for if the retail consumer, inhibited by high\r\nprices, could not buy, the former was unable to sell. At this epoch\r\nvine-grower and pauper were synonymous terms.[230] In certain districts\r\nof the Champagne the inhabitants actually threw their wine into the\r\nriver to avoid paying the duties, and the Provincial Assembly declared\r\nthat 'in the greater part of the province the slightest increase in\r\nduty would cause all the husbandmen to abandon the soil.'[231] It\r\nis scarcely to be wondered at that under such a system of excessive\r\ntaxation the _fermiers généraux_, who all made good bargains with the\r\nState, should have amassed immense fortunes, whilst denying themselves\r\nno kind of luxury and enjoyment. They built themselves princely hotels,\r\nrivalled the nobility and even the Court in the splendour of their\r\nentertainments, grasped at money for the sensual gratification it would\r\npurchase, and loved pleasure for its own sake, and women for their\r\nbeauty and _complaisance_. The _fermiers généraux_ of the province of\r\nChampagne had their bureaux, known as the Hôtel des Fermes, at Reims,\r\nand, after the town-hall, this was the handsomest civil edifice in the\r\ncity. Erected in 1756 from designs by Legendre, it occupies to-day the\r\nprincipal side of the Place Royale. On the pediment of the façade is a\r\nbas-relief of Mercury, the god of commerce, in company with Penelope\r\nand the youthful Pan, surrounding whom are children engaged with the\r\nvintage and with bales of wool, typical of the staple trades of the\r\ncapital of the Champagne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAS-RELIEF ON THE ANCIENT HÔTEL DES FERMES AT REIMS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: L'ACCORD FRATERNEL\r\n\r\n(From a print published at the commencement of the Revolution).]\r\n\r\nThe revolutionary epoch presents a wide gap in the written history\r\nof sparkling Champagne which no one seems to have taken the trouble\r\nof filling, though this hiatus can be to some extent bridged over by\r\na glance at the caricatures of the period. It is evident from these\r\nthat Champagne continued to be the fashionable wine _par excellence_.\r\nWe can comprehend it was _de rigueur_ to 'fouetter le Champagne'[232]\r\nat the epicurean repasts held at the _petits maisons_ of the rich\r\n_fermiers généraux_, and that the _talons rouges_ of the Court of\r\nLouis Seize were not averse to the payment of 3 livres 10 sols for\r\na bottle of this delightful beverage[233] when regaling some fair\r\n_émule_ of Sophie Arnould or Mademoiselle Guimard in the _coulisses_.\r\nOne evening Mademoiselle Laguerre appeared on the stage as Iphigenia\r\nunmistakably intoxicated. 'Ah,' interjected the lively Sophie, 'this\r\nis not Iphigenia in Tauris, but Iphigenia in Champagne.' A proof of\r\nthe aristocratic status of the wine is furnished by a print entitled\r\n_L'Accord Fraternel_, published at the very outset of the revolutionary\r\nmovement, when it was fondly hoped that the Three Orders of the States\r\nGeneral would unite in bringing about a harmonious solution to the\r\nevils by which France was sorely beset. In this the burly well-fed\r\nrepresentative of the clergy holds out a bumper of Burgundy; the\r\npeasant--not one of the lean scraggy labourers, with neither shirt\r\nnor sabots,[234] prowling about half naked and hunger-stricken in\r\nquest of roots and nettle-tops, but a regular stage peasant in white\r\nstockings and pumps--grips a tumbler well filled with _vin du pays_;\r\nwhile the nobleman, elaborately arrayed in full military costume, with\r\nsword, cockade, and tie-wig all complete, delicately poises between\r\nhis finger and thumb a tall _flute_ charged with sparkling Champagne.\r\nMoreover, we can plainly trace the exhilarating influence of the wine\r\nupon the 'feather-headed young ensigns' at the memorable banquet given\r\nto the officers of the Régiment de Flandre by the Gardes du Corps at\r\nVersailles, on the 2d Oct. 1789.[235]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MIRABEAU TONNEAU\r\n\r\n(From a sketch by Camille Desmoulins).]\r\n\r\nConspicuous amongst the titled topers of this period was the Viscount\r\nde Mirabeau--the younger brother of the celebrated orator and a fervent\r\nRoyalist--nicknamed Mirabeau Tonneau, or Barrel Mirabeau, 'on account\r\nof his rotundity, and the quantity of strong liquor he contains.'[236]\r\nIn a caricature dated 'An 1^{er} de la liberté,' and ascribed to\r\nCamille Desmoulins,[237] with whom the viscount long waged a paper\r\nwar, his physical and bibacious attributes are very happily hit off.\r\nHis body is a barrel; his arms, pitchers; his thighs, rundlets; and\r\nhis legs inverted Champagne flasks; whilst in his left hand he holds a\r\nfoam-crowned _flute_, and in his right another of those flasks, two of\r\nwhich he was credited with emptying at each repast.[238]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LE NOUVEAU PRESSOIR DU CLERGÉ, 1789\r\n\r\n(From a caricature of the epoch).]\r\n\r\nWe have seen that the origin of many of the most famous _crûs_ of\r\nFrance was due to monkish labours, and that at Reims, as elsewhere,\r\na large proportion of the ecclesiastical revenue was derived, either\r\ndirectly or indirectly, from the vineyards of the district. This\r\nwas happily hit off in _Le Nouveau Pressoir du Clergé_, or _New\r\nWine-Press for the Clergy_, published in 1789. A man of the people\r\nand a representative of the Third Estate, the latter in the famous\r\nslouched hat and short cloak, are working the levers of a press, under\r\nthe influence of which a full-faced abbé is rapidly disgorging a shower\r\nof gold. A yet more portly ecclesiastic, worthy to be the Archbishop\r\nof Reims himself, is being led forward, in fear and trembling, to\r\nundergo a like operation; whilst in the background a couple of his\r\ncompeers, reduced to the leanness of church-rats, are making off with\r\ngesticulations of despair.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRI QUATRE AND LOUIS SEIZE.\r\n\r\n'Ventre St. Gris! Is this my grandson Louis?'\r\n\r\n(Facsimile of a woodcut of the time.)]\r\n\r\nThe chief personal traits of Louis Seize, as depicted in numerous\r\ncontemporary memoirs, seem to have been a passion for making locks and\r\na gross and inordinate appetite. High feeding usually implies deep\r\ndrinking, and one may suppose that a wine so highly esteemed at Court\r\nas Champagne was not neglected by the royal gourmand. Still there seems\r\nto have been nothing in the unfortunate monarch's career to justify\r\nthe cruel caricature wherein he is shown with the ears and hoofs of a\r\nswine wallowing in a wine-vat, with bottles, flasks, pitchers, cups,\r\ngoblets, glasses, and _flûtes_ of every variety scattered around him;\r\nwhilst Henri Quatre, who has just crossed the Styx on a visit to earth,\r\nexclaims in amazement, 'Ventre St. Gris! is this my grandson Louis?' In\r\nanother caricature, entitled 'Le Gourmand,' and said to represent an\r\nincident in the flight of the royal family from Paris, Louis XVI. is\r\nshown seated at table--surrounded by stringed flasks of Champagne, with\r\nthe customary tall glasses--engaged in devouring a plump capon. His\r\nMajesty is evidently annoyed at being interrupted in the middle of his\r\nrepast, but it is difficult to divine who the intruder is intended for.\r\nHe can scarcely be one of the commissioners despatched by the National\r\nAssembly to secure the king's return to Paris, as the German hussars\r\ndrawn up in the doorway are inconsistent with this supposition. The\r\nfemale figure before the looking-glass is of course intended for Marie\r\nAntoinette, whilst the ungainly young cub in the background is meant\r\nfor the Dauphin in an evident tantrum with his nurse.[239]\r\n\r\nAs to the pamphleteers, who advocated the Rights of Man and aspersed\r\nMarie Antoinette; the poets, who addressed their countless airy trifles\r\nto Phyllis and Chloe; the penniless disciples of Boucher and Greuze;\r\nand the incipient demagogues, briefless advocates, unbeneficed abbés,\r\ndiscontented bourgeois, whose eloquence was to shatter the throne of\r\nthe Bourbons, they were fain for the time being to content themselves\r\nwith the _petit bleu_ of Argenteuil or Suresnes, consumed in company\r\nwith Manon or Margot, in one of the dingy smoky _cabarets_ which the\r\n_café_ was so soon in a great measure to replace. When, however, their\r\nday did come, we may be sure they denied themselves no luxury, and\r\nsparkling Champagne would certainly have graced Danton's luxurious\r\nrepasts, and may possibly have played its part at the last repast of\r\nthe condemned Girondins. In '93, we find Champagne of 1779--the still\r\nwine, of course--announced for sale at Lemoine's shop in the Palais\r\nRoyal; while a delectable compound, styled _crême de fleur d'orange\r\ngrillée au vin de Champagne_, was obtainable at Théron's in the Rue St.\r\nMartin.[240] The sparkling wine can scarcely have failed to figure on\r\nthe _carte_ of the sumptuous repasts furnished by the _restaurateurs_,\r\nMéot and Beauvillers, to the _de facto_ rulers of France,[241]\r\nalthough in 1795 the price of wine generally in Paris had increased\r\ntenfold.[242] Ex-_procureurs_ of the defunct Parliament carefully\r\nhoarded all that remained of the Champagne formerly lavished upon them\r\nby their ex-clients;[243] whilst the latter had to content themselves\r\nwith tea at London and beer at Coblenz.[244]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAlthough details respecting the progress of the Champagne wine-trade\r\nat home and abroad at the outset of the present century are somewhat\r\nscanty, we readily gather that the great popularity of the sparkling\r\nwine throughout Europe dates from an event which, at the time of\r\nits occurrence, the short-sighted Champenois looked upon as most\r\ndisastrous. This was the Allied invasion of 1814-15. Consumption,\r\nso far as the foreign market was concerned, had been grievously\r\ninterrupted by the great upset in all commercial matters consequent\r\nupon the wars of the Revolution and the Empire. It appears that the\r\nwhite wines of Champagne were sent to Paris, Normandy, Italy, and,\r\n'when circumstances permitted of it,' to England, Holland, Sweden,\r\nDenmark, Russia, Spain, Portugal, and 'beyond the seas.' But the trade\r\nhad suffered greatly during the wars with Austria and Russia in 1806\r\nand 1807; and in the following years the consumption of white wine had\r\nfallen considerably, and a large number of wine-merchants had found\r\nthemselves unable to meet their engagements.[245]\r\n\r\nThe wine which Napoleon I. preferred is said to have been Chambertin;\r\nstill, his intimacy with the Moëts of Epernay could scarcely fail to\r\nhave led to a supply of the best sparkling Champagne from the cellars\r\nhe had deigned to visit in person. His satraps, who travelled with the\r\nretinue of sovereign princes, included the wine in their equipment\r\nwherever they went, and the popping of its mimic artillery echoed in\r\ntheir tents the thunder of their victorious cannon. But comparatively\r\nfew foreign guests met at their tables; and as their foes had on their\r\nside few victories to celebrate in a similar style, the knowledge of\r\nsparkling Champagne outside France was confined to the comparatively\r\nsmall number of persons of wealth and position able to pay an\r\nextravagant price for it.\r\n\r\nAt length the fatal year, 1814, arrived, and the Allies swarmed across\r\nthe frontier after the 'nations' fight' at Leipzig. The Champagne\r\nlying directly on the way to Paris saw some hard fighting and pitiless\r\nplundering. The Prussians of Baron von Tromberg got most consumedly\r\ndrunk at Epernay. The Cossacks ravaged Rilly, Taissy, and the other\r\nvillages of the Mountain; and not being able to carry off all the wine\r\nthey found at Sillery, 'added to their atrocities,' in the words of an\r\nanonymous local chronicler,[246] by staving in the barrels and flooding\r\nthe cellars. The Russians, under the renegade St. Priest, seized on\r\nReims, whetted their thirst with salt herrings till the retail price\r\nof these dainties rose from 5 liards a pair to 3 sous apiece, and then\r\nset to work to quench it with Champagne to such an extent that when\r\nNapoleon suddenly swooped down upon the city like his own emblematic\r\neagle, a large number of them, especially among the officers, were\r\nneither in a condition to fight nor fly.[247]\r\n\r\nThe immense body of foreign troops who remained quartered in the\r\neast of France after the downfall of the Empire continued to pay\r\nunabated devotion to the _dive bouteille_. Tradition has especially\r\ndistinguished the Russians, and relates how the Cossacks used to pour\r\nChampagne into buckets, and share it with their horses. But the walking\r\nsand-beds of North Germany, the swag-bellied warriors of Baden and\r\nBavaria, and the stanch topers of Saxony and Swabia must of a surety\r\nhave distinguished themselves. The votaries of Gambrinus, the beer\r\nking, strove whether they could empty as many bottles of Champagne at\r\na sitting as they could flagons filled with the amber-hued beverage of\r\ntheir native province; while the inhabitants of those districts where\r\nthe grape ripens sought to institute exhaustive comparisons between the\r\nvintages they gathered at home and the growths of the favoured region\r\nin which they now found themselves.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LES RUSSES À PARIS\r\n\r\n(From a coloured print of the time).]\r\n\r\nThe Berliner was fain to acknowledge the superiority of the foam\r\nengendered by Champagne over that crowning his favourite _weissbier_,\r\nhis own beloved _kuhle blonde_, and the beer-topers of Munich and\r\nDresden to give the preference to the exhilaration produced by quaffing\r\nthe wine of Reims and Epernay over that due to the consumption of\r\n_bockbier_. The Nassauer and the Rhinelander had to admit certain\r\nintrinsic merits in the vintages produced on the slopes of the Marne,\r\nand found to be lacking in those grown on the banks of the Rhine, the\r\nAhr, the Main, and the Moselle. The Austrian recognised the superiority\r\nof the wines of the Mountain over those of Voslau or the Luttenberg;\r\nand the Magyar had to allow that the _crûs_ of the River possessed a\r\nspecial charm which Nature had denied to his imperial Tokay. Even the\r\nred-coated officers who followed 'Milord Vilainton' to the great review\r\nat Mont Aimé, near Epernay, proved faithless to that palladium of the\r\nBritish mess-table, their beloved 'black strop.' Claret might in their\r\neyes be only fit for boys and Frenchmen, and Port the sole drink for\r\nmen; but they were forced to hail Champagne as being, as old Baudius\r\nhad already phrased it, 'a wine for gods.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LE DÎNER DE MILORD GOGO, 1816\r\n\r\n(After a coloured print of the time).]\r\n\r\nThe officers of the Allied armies quartered in Paris after the\r\nHundred Days supplemented the charms of the Palais Royal--then in the\r\nvery apogee of its vogue as the true centre of Parisian life, with\r\nits cafés, restaurants, theatres, gambling-houses, and Galeries de\r\nBois--with an abundance of sparkling Champagne. Royalty itself set the\r\nexample by indicating a marked preference for the wine, Louis Dixhuit,\r\naccording to a statement made by Wellington to Rogers, drinking nothing\r\nelse at dinner. To celebrate the victories of Leipsic and Waterloo or\r\na successful assault on the bank at Frascati's, to console for the\r\nloss of a _grosse mise_ at No. 113 or of a comrade transfixed beneath\r\na lamp in the Rue Montpensier by a Bonapartist sword-blade, to win the\r\nsmiles of some fickle Aspasia of the Palais Royal Camp des Tartares or\r\nto blot out the recollection of her infidelity, to wash down one of the\r\nHomeric repasts in which the English prototypes of the 'Fudge Family\r\nAbroad' indulged, the wine was indispensable; until, as a modern writer\r\nhas put it, 'Waterloo was avenged at last by the _gros bataillons_ of\r\nthe bankers at _roulette_ and _trente et quarante_, and by the sale\r\nto the invaders of many thousand bottles of rubbishing Champagne at\r\ntwelve francs the flask.'[248] The rancorous enmity prevailing between\r\nthe officers of Bonapartist proclivities placed on half-pay and the\r\nreturned _émigrés_ who had accepted commissions from Louis XVIII.,\r\nresulted, as is well known, in numerous hostile meetings. Captain\r\nGronow has dwelt upon the bellicose exploits of a gigantic Irish\r\nofficer in the _gardes du corps_, named Warren, who, when 'excited by\r\nChampagne and brandy,'[249] was prepared to defy an army; and he tells\r\nus that at Tortoni's there was a room set apart for such quarrelsome\r\ngentlemen, where, after these meetings, they indulged in riotous\r\nChampagne breakfasts.[250] At home, the British Government were being\r\ntwitted on their parsimony in limiting the supply of Champagne for\r\nthe table of the exiled Emperor at St. Helena to a single bottle per\r\ndiem, a circumstance which led Sir Walter Scott to protest against the\r\nconduct of Lord Bathurst and Sir Hudson Lowe in denying the captive\r\n'even the solace of intoxication.'\r\n\r\nAs is not unfrequently the case, out of evil came good. The assembled\r\nnations had drunk of a charmed fountain, and it had excited a thirst\r\nwhich could not be quenched. The Russians had become acquainted with\r\nChampagne, which Talleyrand had styled '_le vin civilisateur par\r\nexcellence_,' and to love this wine was with them a very decided step\r\ntowards a liberal education. Millions of bottles, specially fortified\r\nto the pitch of strength and sweetness suited for a hyperborean\r\nclimate, were annually despatched to the great northern empire from the\r\nhouse of Clicquot; and later on the travellers of rival firms, eager\r\nto secure a portion of this patronage, traversed the dominions of the\r\nautocrat throughout their length and breadth, and poured their wines\r\nin wanton profusion down the throats of one and all of those from whom\r\nthere appeared a prospect of securing custom.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nFrom this influx of sparkling wine into the frozen empire of the Czar\r\nthe acceptance of civilisation--of rather a superficial character,\r\nit is true--may be said to date. Had Peter the Great only preferred\r\nChampagne to corn-brandy, the country would have been Europeanised long\r\nago. As it is, the wine has to-day become a recognised necessity in\r\nhigher class Russian society, and scandal even asserts that whenever it\r\nis given at a dinner-party, the host is careful to throw the windows\r\nopen, in order that the popping of the corks may announce the fact\r\nto his neighbours. Abroad the Russians are more reserved in their\r\nmanners; and though ranking amongst the best customers of the Parisian\r\n_restaurateurs_ for high-class wines, it is only now and then that some\r\nexcited Calmuck is to be seen flooding the glasses of his companions\r\nwith Champagne in a public dining-room. The Russians, it should be\r\nnoted, have sought, and not unsuccessfully, to produce sparkling wines\r\nof their own, more especially in the country of the Don Cossacks and\r\nnear the Axis.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBéranger might exclaim, with a poet's license, that he preferred a\r\nTurkish invasion to seeing the wines of the Champagne profaned by\r\nthe descendants of the Alemanni;[251] but the merchants of Reims and\r\nEpernay were of a different opinion. _Les militaires_ have always\r\naffected Champagne; and a military aristocracy like that of the\r\nFatherland, in the cruel days when peace forbade any more free quarters\r\nand requisitions, became as large purchasers of the wine as their\r\nsomewhat scanty revenues allowed of. Their example was followed to a\r\nconsiderable extent by the self-made members of that plutocratic class\r\nwhich modern speculation has caused to spring into life in Germany.\r\nAdvantage was speedily taken of this taste by their own countrymen,\r\nwho aimed at supplanting Champagne by sparkling wines grown on native\r\nslopes. Nay more, the Germans, as a military nation, felt bound to\r\ncarry the war into the enemy's territory, and hence it is that many\r\nimportant houses at Reims and Epernay are of German origin. Across the\r\nRhine patriotism has had to yield to popularity, and the stanchest\r\nnative topers have been forced to acknowledge, after due comparison in\r\nsmoky _wein stuben_ and gloomy _keller_, that, though the sparkling\r\nwines of the Rhine and the Moselle are in their own way most excellent,\r\nthere is but one _Champagner-wein_, with Reims for its Mecca and\r\nEpernay for its Medina.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOf England we shall elsewhere speak at length; but the speculative\r\ntrade of her colonies, with its sharp bargains, dead smashes, and large\r\nprofits could hardly be carried on without the wheels of the car of\r\nCommerce and the tongues of her votaries being oiled with Champagne.\r\nThe Swiss have only proved the truth of the proverb that imitation\r\nis the sincerest form of flattery by producing tolerable replicas of\r\nChampagne at Neufchâtel, Vevay, and Sion. Northern, or, to speak by the\r\nmap, Scandinavian, Europe takes its fair share of the genuine article;\r\nand although the economic Belgian is apt to accept sparkling Saumur and\r\nVouvray as a substitute, both he and his neighbour, the Dutchman, can\r\nto the full appreciate the superiority of the produce of the Marne over\r\nthat of the Loire.\r\n\r\nThe Italian and the Spaniard may affect to outwardly despise a liquor\r\nwhich they profess not to be able to recognise as wine at all; but the\r\nformer has to allow, _per Bacco_, that it excels in its particular\r\nway his extolled Lacryma Christi, while the latter does not carry his\r\nproverbial sobriety so far as to exclude the wine from repasts in\r\nthe upper circles of Peninsular society. Moreover, of recent years\r\nthey have both commenced making sparkling wines of their own. The\r\nAustrian also produces sparkling wines from native vintages, notably\r\nat Voslau, Graz, and Marburg; still this has not in any way lessened\r\nhis admiration for, or his consumption of, Champagne. The Greek is\r\nready enough to 'dash down yon cup of Samian wine,' provided there be a\r\ngoblet of Champagne close at hand to replace it with; and boyards and\r\nmagnates of the debateable ground of Eastern Europe not only imbibe\r\nthe sparkling wines of the Marne ostentatiously and approvingly, but\r\nseveral of them have essayed the manufacture of _vin mousseux_ on their\r\nown estates.\r\n\r\nThe East, the early home of the vine, and the first region to impart\r\ncivilisation, is perhaps the last to receive its reflux in the shape of\r\nsparkling wine. But, the prohibition of the Prophet notwithstanding,\r\nChampagne is to be purchased on the banks of the Golden Horn, and has\r\nbeen imported extensively into Egypt in company with _opéra-bouffe_,\r\nFrench _figurantes_, stock-jobbing, and sundry other matters of\r\nforeign extraction under the _régime_ of the late Khedive. The land\r\nof Iran has beheld with wonderment its sovereign freely quaffing the\r\nfizzing beverage of the Franks in place of the wine of Shiraz. The\r\nEast Indies consume Champagne in abundance; for it figures not only\r\non the proverbially hospitable tables of the merchants and officials\r\nof Calcutta, Bombay, and Madras, but at the symposia of most of the\r\nrajahs, princes, nawabs, and other native rulers. The almond-eyed\r\ninhabitant of 'far Cathay,' reluctant to abandon that strange\r\ncivilisation so diametrically opposed in all its details to our own,\r\ncontinues to drink his native vintages, warm and out of porcelain\r\ncups, and to regard the sparkling drink of the Fanquis as a veritable\r\n'devils' elixir.' But his utterly differing neighbour, the Japanese, so\r\neager to welcome everything European, has gladly greeted the advent of\r\nChampagne, and freely yielded to its fascination.\r\n\r\nTurning to the undiscovered continent, we find sable sovereigns ruling\r\nat the mouths of the unexplored rivers of Equatorial Africa fully\r\nacquainted with Champagne, though disposed, from the native coarseness\r\nof their taste, to rank it as inferior to rum; whilst the Arab, filled\r\nwith wonderment at the marvels of European civilisation which meet his\r\neye at Algiers, bears back with him to the _douar_, wrapped up in the\r\nfolds of his burnous, a couple of bottles of the wondrous effervescing\r\ndrink of the Feringhees as a testimony, even as Othere brought the\r\nwalrus-tooth to Alfred. One enthusiastic Algerian colonist has gone\r\nso far as to prophesy the advent of the day when the products of the\r\nnative vineyards shall eclipse Champagne.[252] Let us hope, however,\r\nin the interest of Algerian digestions, that this day is as yet far\r\ndistant.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWith respect to the consumption of Champagne in the Western world,\r\nthe United States' exceeds that of any European country, England and\r\nFrance alone excepted, despite the competition of sparkling Catawba and\r\nof a certain diabolical imitation, the raw material of which, it is\r\nasserted, is furnished not by the grapes of the Carolinas, the peaches\r\nof New Jersey, or the apples of Vermont, but by the oil-wells of\r\nPennsylvania--in fact, petroleum Champagne. The _cabinet particulier_\r\nseems to be an institution as firmly established in the leading\r\ncities of the States as in Paris; and rumour says that drinking from\r\na Champagne-glass touched by a fair one's lips has replaced the New\r\nEngland pastime of eating the same piece of maple-candy till mouths\r\nmeet. As regards the South American Republics, the popping of musketry\r\nat each fresh _pronunciamento_ is certain to be succeeded by that of\r\nChampagne-corks in honour of the success of one or the other of the\r\ncontending parties.\r\n\r\nIn Europe Champagne has continued to be, from the days of Paulmier and\r\nVenner downwards, the drink of kings, princes, and great lords as they\r\ndescribed it. Take a list of the potentates of the present century,\r\nand the majority of them will be found to have evinced at some time or\r\nother a partiality for the wine. Louis XVIII. drank nothing else at\r\ntable. The late ruler of Prussia, Frederick William IV., had such a\r\npenchant for Champagne of a particular manufacture, that he obtained\r\nthe cognomen of King Clicquot. The predecessor of Pio Nono, Gregory\r\nXVI., rivalled him in this appreciation, and, terrible to relate, so\r\ndid the Commander of the Faithful, Abdul Medjid. The latter might,\r\nhowever, have pleaded the excuse put forward by Abd-el-Kader, that\r\nalthough the Prophet had forbidden wine, yet Champagne came into the\r\ncategory of aerated waters, concerning which he had said nothing, a\r\nremark justifying the title given to this wit-inspiring beverage of\r\nbeing 'the father of _bons mots_.' Prince Bismarck, in the stormy\r\nperiod of his youth, was in the barbarous habit of imbibing Champagne\r\nmixed with porter; but at present he judiciously alternates it with old\r\nPort. Marshal MacMahon and the King of the Belgians are said to drink\r\nthe pink variety of the _vin mousseux_ by preference.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'SOUS LA TONNELLE'\r\n\r\n(From a print of the time of the Restoration).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'AU BEAU SEXE!']\r\n\r\nNaturally, in France as elsewhere, the sparkling vintage of the Marne\r\nmaintains its claims to be reckoned the wine of beauty and fashion,\r\nand more especially in beauty's gayer hours. A glass of Champagne\r\nand a _biscuit de Reims_ has been a refection which, though often\r\nverbally declined, was in the end pretty sure to be accepted from the\r\ndays of the _merveilleuses_ and _incroyables_, through those of the\r\n_lionnes_, down to the present epoch of the _cocodettes de la haute\r\ngomme_. Neither at ceremonial banquets nor at ordinary dinner-parties\r\namong our neighbours does Champagne hold, however, so prominent a\r\nplace as amongst ourselves, owing to the great variety of other\r\nwines--all capable of appreciation by trained palates--entering into\r\nthe composition of these festive repasts. In fact, a _repas de noces_\r\nis the only occasion on which Champagne flows in France with anything\r\nlike the freedom to which we are accustomed; and then it is that its\r\nexhilarating effect is marked, as some portly old boy rises with\r\ntwinkling eye to propose the health of the bride, or of that _beau\r\nsexe_ to which he feels bound to profess himself deeply devoted. At\r\nsuch open-air gatherings as the races at Longchamps and Chantilly, the\r\n_buffet_ will be besieged by a succession of frail fair ones in the\r\nmost elaborate _toilettes de courses_, seeking to nerve themselves to\r\nwitness a coming struggle, or to console themselves for the defeat\r\nof the horse backed by their favoured admirer. And, when writing of\r\nthis wine, it is altogether impossible to omit a reference to those\r\n_tête-à-tête_ repasts _en cabinet particulier_, of which it is the\r\nindispensable adjunct. Its mollifying influence on the feminine heart\r\non occasions such as these has been happily hit off by Charles Monselet\r\nin his _Polichinelle au Restaurant_:\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n

favourite as Champagne now is with all classes in England,\r\nthe earliest notice of it in connection with our history nevertheless\r\nrepresents it in a somewhat inimical light. For, according to an\r\nItalian writer of the fifteenth century, 'the strong and foaming wine\r\nof Champagne was found so injurious that Henry V. was obliged, after\r\nthe battle of Agincourt, to forbid its use in his army, excepting\r\nwhen tempered with water.'[254] Although this may be the earliest\r\nmention of the wine of the Champagne by name in association with our\r\nown countrymen, opportunities had been previously afforded to them\r\nof becoming acquainted with its assumed objectionable qualities. The\r\nprelates who crossed 'the streak of silver sea' with Thurstan of York\r\nto attend the ecclesiastical councils held at 'little Rome,' as Reims\r\nwas styled in the twelfth century, and the knights and nobles who\r\nswelled the train of Henry II. when he did homage to Philip Augustus at\r\nthe latter's coronation, may be regarded as exceptionally fortunate,\r\nor unfortunate, in this respect, since the bulk of the English\r\nwine-drinkers of that day had to content themselves with the annual\r\nshipments of Anjou and Poitevin wines from Nantes and La Rochelle.[255]\r\nBut the stout men-at-arms and death-dealing archers who followed the\r\nthird Edward to the gates of Reims in the days when\r\n\r\n    ''Twas merry, 'twas merry in France to go,\r\n    A yeoman stout with a bended bow,\r\n    To venge the King on his mortal foe,\r\n      And to quaff the Gascon wine,'\r\n\r\nno doubt found consolation for some of the hardships they endured\r\nduring their wet and weary watches in the bitter winter of 1365 in the\r\nfamiliarity they acquired with the vintages of the Mountain and the\r\nMarne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAnd, their sovereign's prohibition notwithstanding, there is every\r\nreason to believe that the heroes of Agincourt drank pottle-deep of\r\nthe forbidden beverage. The grim Earl of Salisbury bore no love to\r\nthe burghers of Reims;[256] but there is little likelihood that his\r\naversion extended to the wine of the province he ruled as governor,\r\nand the garrisons of its various strongholds over which the red cross\r\nof St. George triumphantly floated revelled on the best of 'the white\r\nwyne and the rede.' In the days of hot fighting and keen foraging which\r\nmarked the close of Bedford's regency, there is ample evidence to show\r\nthat our countrymen had acquired and retained a very decided taste for\r\nthese growths. When Charles VII. entered Reims in triumph, with Jeanne\r\nDarc by his side and the chivalry of France around him, the retreating\r\nEnglish garrison bore forth with them on the opposite side of the city\r\na string of wains piled high with casks of wine, the pillage of the\r\nburghers' cellars.[257]\r\n\r\nTradition tells, too, how the English, besieged in the town of Epernay,\r\nhad gathered there great store of wine, and how this suggested to\r\ntheir captain a cunning stratagem. Having caused a number of wagons to\r\nbe laden with casks of wine, he despatched them with a feeble escort\r\nthrough the gate furthest from the beleaguering forces, as though\r\ndestined to Chalons as a place of safety. The French commander marked\r\nthis, and as soon as the convoy was well clear of the walls, a body\r\nof horse came spurring after it in hot haste. The wagon-train halted;\r\nthere was a brief attempt to turn the laden vehicles homewards, and\r\nthen, seeing the hopelessness of this, the escort galloped back into\r\nthe town, and down swooped the Frenchmen on their prize. The ride had\r\nbeen sharp; the day was hot, and the road dusty. So a score of the\r\ncaptured casks were quickly broached; and as the generous fluid flowed\r\nfreely down the throats of the captors, it soon began to produce an\r\neffect. Some of them, overcome by the heat and the wine, loosened\r\ntheir armour, and stretched themselves at length on the ground; whilst\r\nothers, grouped around some fast emptying barrel, continued to quaff\r\nfrom their helmets and other improvised drinking vessels confusion\r\nto the 'island bull-dogs.' When lo, the gate of the town flew open;\r\nan English trumpet rang out its note of defiance; and, with lances\r\nlevelled, the flower of the garrison poured forth like a living\r\navalanche upon the startled Frenchmen. Before they could make ready to\r\nfight or fly, the foe was upon them, and their blood was soon mingling\r\non the dusty highway with the pools of wine which had gushed forth\r\nfrom the abandoned casks. Hardly one escaped the slaughter; but local\r\ntradition chuckles grimly as it notes that in revenge thereof every\r\nman of the garrison was put to the edge of the sword on the subsequent\r\ncapture of the town by the French.[258]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt the close of the fruitless struggle against the growing power\r\nof Charles the Victorious, we were fain to fall back, as of old,\r\nupon the strong wines of south-western France, the vintages of\r\nBergerac, Gaillac, and Rabestens, shipped to us from the banks of the\r\nGaronne,[259] and the luscious malmseys of the Archipelago, to which\r\nwere subsequently added the growths of southern Spain. The taste of the\r\nwine of the Champagne must have been almost forgotten amongst us when\r\nthe growing fame of the vineyards of Ay attracted the notice of Bluff\r\nKing Hal. Most likely he and Francis I. swore eternal good fellowship\r\nat the Field of the Cloth of Gold over a beaker of this regal liquor.\r\nOnce alive to its merits, the King, whose ambassadors, _pace_ John\r\nStyles, seem to have had standing orders to keep an equally sharp look\r\nout for wines or wives likely to suit the royal fancy, neglected no\r\nopportunity of securing it in perfection. Like his contemporaries,\r\nCharles V., Francis I., and Leo X., he stationed a commissioner at\r\nAy intrusted with the onerous duty of selecting a certain number of\r\ncasks of the best growths, and despatching them, carefully sealed, to\r\nthe cellars of Whitehall, Greenwich, and Richmond. The example set\r\nby the monarch was, however, too costly a one to be followed by his\r\nsubjects, and the very name of Champagne probably remained unknown to\r\nthem for years to come. The poets and dramatists of the Elizabethan\r\nera, who have left us so accurate a picture of the manners of their\r\nday, and make such frequent allusions to the wines in vogue, do not\r\neven mention Champagne; Gervase Markham preserves a like silence in\r\nhis _Modern Housewife_,[260] while the passages in Surflet's _Maison\r\nRustique_ extolling the wine of Ay are merely translations from the\r\noriginal French edition.[261] And though Venner speaks of these wines\r\nas excelling all others, he is careful to attribute their consumption\r\nto the King and the nobles of France.[262]\r\n\r\nThe captive Queen of Scots, whose consumption of wine elicited dire\r\nlament from one of her lordly jailers,[263] may have missed at\r\nFotheringay the vintage she had tasted in early life when enjoying\r\nthe hospitality of her uncle, Cardinal Charles of Lorraine, at Reims;\r\nbut to the half-hearted pedant, her son, the name of Epernay recalled\r\nno convivial associations--it was merely the title of a part of his\r\nslaughtered mother's appanage. Spanish influence and Spanish wine ruled\r\nsupreme at his Court; and though Rhenish crowned the goblets of many of\r\nthe high-souled cavaliers who rallied round King Charles and Henrietta\r\nMaria, the bulk of the English nation remained faithful, till the close\r\nof the Commonwealth, to their old favourites of the south of Spain and\r\nthe fragrant produce of the Canaries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAll this was altered when 'the King enjoyed his own again;' for\r\nthe Restoration made Champagne--that is, the still red wine of the\r\nprovince--the most fashionable, if not the most popular, wine in\r\nEngland. At the Court of Louis XIV. the future Merry Monarch and his\r\nfaithful followers had acquired a taste for the wines of France, and\r\nthey brought back this taste,[264] together with sundry others of a\r\nfar more reprehensible character, with them to England. One of the\r\nfirst and most acceptable gifts of Louis to his brother-sovereign\r\non the latter's recall was 'two hundred hogsheads of excellent\r\nwine--Champagne, Burgundy, and Hermitage.'[265] Returning home more\r\nFrench than the French themselves, the late exiles ruminated on the\r\nflesh-pots of Egypt, and sighed; and we can readily picture a gallant\r\nwho had seen hot service under Condé or Turenne exclaiming to his\r\nfriend and fellow-soldier:\r\n\r\n    'Ah, Courtine, must we be always idle? Must we never see our\r\n    glorious days again? When shall we be rolling in the lands of milk\r\n    and honey, encamped in large luxuriant vineyards, where the loaded\r\n    vines cluster about our tents, drink the rich juice just pressed\r\n    from the plump grape?'[266]\r\n\r\nAnd that friend replying:\r\n\r\n    'Ah, Beaugard, those days have been; but now we must resolve to\r\n    content ourselves at an humble rate. Methinks it is not unpleasant\r\n    to consider how I have seen thee in a large pavilion drowning\r\n    the heat of the day in Champagne wines--sparkling sweet as those\r\n    charming beauties whose dear remembrance every glass recorded--with\r\n    half a dozen honest fellows more.'[267]\r\n\r\nDemand created supply, until, in 1667, a few years after the\r\nRestoration, France furnished two-fifths of the amount of wine consumed\r\nin the kingdom;[268] and the taste of the royal sybarite for the\r\nlight-coloured wines of the Marne seems to be hinted at in Malagene's\r\nexclamation:\r\n\r\n    'I have discovered a treasure of pale wine.... I assure you 'tis\r\n    the same the King drinks of.'[269]\r\n\r\nSt. Evremond, who, though not precisely cast by Nature from 'the mould\r\nof form,' fulfilled for many years the duties of arbiter elegantiarum\r\nat Charles's graceless Court, decidedly did his best to render the\r\nChampagne _flûte_ 'the glass of fashion.' Ever ready to speak in praise\r\nof the wines of Ay, Avenay, and Reims,[270] the mentor of the Count de\r\nGrammont strove by example as well as by precept to win converts to\r\nhis creed. In verse he declares that the beauties of the country fail\r\nto console him for the absence of Champagne; regrets that the season\r\nof the wines of the Marne is over, and that the yield of those of the\r\nMountain had failed; and shudders at the prospect of being obliged to\r\nhave recourse to the Loire, to Bordeaux, or to Cahors for the wine he\r\nwill have to drink.[271]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe lively Frenchman found plenty of native writers to reëcho him.\r\nChampagne sparkles in all the plays of the Restoration, and seems the\r\nfitting inspiration of their matchless briskness of dialogue. The\r\nMillamours and Bellairs, the Carelesses and Rangers, the Sir Joskin\r\nJolleys and Sir Fopling Flutters, the _beaux_ of the Mall and the\r\nrakes of the Mulberry and New Spring Gardens, the gay frequenters of\r\nthe Folly on the Thames and the _habitués_ of Pontack's Ordinary, whom\r\nthe contemporary dramatists transferred bodily to the stage of the\r\nKing's or the Duke's, are constantly tossing off bumpers of it. Their\r\nlives would seem to have been one continuous round of love-making and\r\nChampagne-drinking, to judge from the following 'catch,' sung by four\r\nmerry gentlemen at a period when, according to Redding, ten thousand\r\ntuns of French wine were annually pouring into England:\r\n\r\n        'The pleasures of love and the joys of good wine,\r\n        To perfect our happiness, wisely we join;\r\n        We to Beauty all day\r\n        Give the sovereign sway,\r\n        And her favourite nymphs devoutly obey.\r\n    At the plays we are constantly making our court,\r\n    And when they are ended we follow the sport\r\n\r\n        To the Mall and the Park,\r\n        Where we love till 'tis dark;\r\n        Then sparkling Champaign[272]\r\n        Puts an end to their reign;\r\n        It quickly recovers\r\n        Poor languishing lovers;\r\n    Makes us frolic and gay, and drowns all our sorrow;\r\n    But, alas, we relapse again on the morrow.'[273]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWe learn, indeed, that under the influence of\r\n\r\n    'powerful Champaign, as they call it, a spark can no more refrain\r\n    running into love than a drunken country vicar can avoid disputing\r\n    of religion when his patron's ale grows stronger than his\r\n    reason.'[274]\r\n\r\nProbably it was owing to this quality of inspiring a tendency to\r\namativeness that ladies were sometimes expected to join in such\r\npotations.\r\n\r\n      'She's no mistress of mine\r\n      That drinks not her wine,\r\n    Or frowns at my friends' drinking motions;\r\n      If my heart thou wouldst gain,\r\n      Drink thy flask of Champaign;\r\n    'Twill serve thee for paint and love-potions,'[275]\r\n\r\nis the sentiment enunciated in chorus by four half-fuddled topers in\r\nthe New Spring Gardens. At the Mulberry Gardens we find that\r\n\r\n    'Jack Wildish sent for a dozen more Champaign, and a brace of\r\n    such girls as we should have made honourable love to in any other\r\n    place.'[276]\r\n\r\nWith such manners and customs can we wonder at one gentleman\r\ncomplaining how another\r\n\r\n    'came where I was last night roaring drunk; swore--d--him!--he had\r\n    been with my Lord Such-a-one, and had swallowed three quarts of\r\n    Champaign for his share;'[277]\r\n\r\nor have any call to feel surprised that such boon companions should\r\n\r\n    'come, as the sparks do, to a playhouse too full of Champaign,\r\n    venting very much noise and very little wit'?[278]\r\n\r\nChampagne remains ignored in such books as the _Mystery of\r\nVintners_;[279] but although technical works may be silent, the poets\r\nvie with the dramatists in extolling its exhilarating effects--effects\r\nsurely perceptible in the witty, careless, graceful verse with which\r\nthe epoch abounds. John Oldham--who, after passing his early years as a\r\nschoolmaster, was lured into becoming, in the words of his biographer,\r\n'at once a votary of Bacchus and Venus' by the patronage of Rochester,\r\nDorset, and Sedley in 1681, and who realised the fable of the pot of\r\nbrass and the pot of earthenware by dying from the effects of the\r\ncompany he kept two years later--has given a list of the wines in vogue\r\nin his day:\r\n\r\n        'Let wealthy merchants, when they dine,\r\n        Run o'er their witty names of wine:\r\n    Their chests of Florence and their Mont Alchine,\r\n    Their Mants, Champaigns, Chablees, Frontiniacks tell;\r\n    Their aums of Hock, of Backrag [Bacharach] and Mosell.'[280]\r\n\r\nHe gives the wines of our 'sweet enemy' a high position, too, in his\r\n_Dithyrambick, spoken by a Drunkard_, who is made to exclaim,\r\n\r\n    'Were France the next, this round Bordeau shall swallow,\r\n    Champaign, Langou [L'Anjou], and Burgundy shall follow.'[281]\r\n\r\nButler makes the hero of his immortal satire prepared to follow the old\r\nRoman fashion with regard to his lady's name, and to\r\n\r\n    'Drink ev'ry letter on't in stum,\r\n    And make it brisk Champaign become;'[282]\r\n\r\nand speaks of routed forces having\r\n\r\n    'Recovered many a desperate campaign\r\n    With Bordeaux, Burgundy, and Champaign.'[283]\r\n\r\nAnd Sir Charles Sedley, in an apologue written towards the close of\r\nthe century, tells how a doctor of his day was sorely troubled by the\r\nunreasonable lives led by his patients, until\r\n\r\n    'One day he called 'em all together,\r\n    And, one by one, he asked 'em whether\r\n    It were not better by good diet\r\n    To keep the blood and humours quiet,\r\n    With toast and ale to cool their brains\r\n    Than nightly fire 'em with Champains.'[284]\r\n\r\nIn 1679 the peculiar ideas of political economy then prevailing led\r\nto a formal prohibition of the importation of French wines, and the\r\nconsequent substitution in their place of those of Portugal. One can\r\nimagine the consternation of the 'beaux' and 'sparks' at this fatal\r\ndecree, and the satisfaction of the few vintners whose cellars chanced\r\nto be well stored with the forbidden vintages of France--with\r\n\r\n    'The Claret smooth, red as the lips we press\r\n    In sparkling fancy while we drain the bowl;\r\n    The mellow-tasted Burgundy, and, quick\r\n    As is the wit it gives, the gay Champagne.'[285]\r\n\r\nBut, Port wine and prohibitions notwithstanding, men of fashion of that\r\nepoch were not entirely obliged to abandon their favourite potations,\r\nsince five thousand hogsheads of French wine were surreptitiously\r\nlanded on the south-west coast of England in a single year.[286]\r\nFortunately, too, for them, the Government came to the conclusion that\r\nit was for the time being futile to fight against popular tastes, and\r\nin 1685 the obnoxious prohibition was removed, with the result that,\r\ntwo years later, the imports of French wine were registered as fifteen\r\nthousand tuns--that is, sixty thousand hogsheads.[287]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the outbreak of hostilities with France in 1689, the import of\r\nFrench wines received a serious check, and as they vanished from the\r\nrevenue returns, so Champagne began to disappear from the social board\r\nand the literature of the day. Strange to say, however, it was not only\r\nthe favourite wine of William III., but of his dethroned father-in-law,\r\nJames II. The red wines of the province of Champagne had always found\r\na ready sale in Flanders and the Low Countries,[288] and quickened the\r\nminds of the stout seamen who fought against Blake and Rupert. The\r\nvariety produced from the Beaune grape at Vertus was the one patronised\r\nby Macaulay's pet hero, the hook-nosed Dutchman,[289] whilst the exile\r\nof St. Germain seems to have been more catholic in his tastes.[290]\r\n\r\nEagerly must the _gourmets_ of the day, when, 'if we did not love the\r\nFrench, we coveted their wines,'[291] have hailed the return of a peace\r\nwhich permitted them not only to indulge in their old favourites, but\r\nto welcome a new attraction in the shape of sparkling Champagne. The\r\nterm 'sparkling' as applied to wine did not at the outset necessarily\r\nmean effervescing, as in one of Farquhar's comedies we find Roebuck\r\ncomparing himself to 'a bumper of Claret, smiling and sparkling.'[292]\r\nTowards the close of the century, however, we meet with sure proof of\r\nthe advent of the delectable beverage with which the worthy cellarer of\r\nHautvillers was the first to endow droughty humanity. The contemporary\r\ndramatists were ever on the alert to shoot Folly as she flew. The stage\r\nwas really the mirror of that time, and those who wrote for it seized\r\non every passing whim, fashion, or fancy of the day. The introduction\r\nof a new wine was certainly not to be missed by them, and the recently\r\ndiscovered _vin mousseux_ of Dom Perignon is plainly referred to in\r\nFarquhar's aptly-named comedy, _Love and a Bottle_, produced in 1698,\r\njust after the Peace of Ryswick had allowed the reopening of trade with\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nThe second scene of act ii. represents the lodgings of Mockmode, the\r\ncountry squire, who aims at being 'a beau,' and who is discovered in\r\nclose confabulation with his landlady, the Widow Bullfinch:\r\n\r\n    '_Mock._ But what's most modish for beverage now? For I suppose the\r\n    fashion of that always alters with the clothes.\r\n\r\n    _W. Bull._ The tailors are the best judges of that; but Champaign,\r\n    I suppose.\r\n\r\n    _Mock._ Is Champaign a tailor? Methinks it were a fitter name for a\r\n    wig-maker. I think they call my wig a campaign.\r\n\r\n    _W. Bull._ You're clear out, sir--clear out. Champaign is a fine\r\n    liquor, which all great beaux drink to make 'em witty.\r\n\r\n    _Mock._ Witty! O, by the universe, I must be witty! I'll drink\r\n    nothing else; I never was witty in my life. Here, Club, bring us a\r\n    bottle of what d'ye call it--the witty liquor.'\r\n\r\nThe Widow having retired, Club, Mockmode's servant, reënters with a\r\nbottle and glasses.\r\n\r\n    '_Mock._ Is that the witty liquor? Come, fill the glasses.... But\r\n    where's the wit now, Club? Have you found it?\r\n\r\n    _Club._ Egad, master, I think 'tis a very good jest.\r\n\r\n    _Mock._ What?\r\n\r\n    _Club._ Why, drinking. You'll find, master, that this same\r\n    gentleman in the straw doublet, this same Will o' the Wisp, is a\r\n    wit at the bottom. Here, here, master, how it puns and quibbles in\r\n    the glass![293]\r\n\r\n    _Mock._ By the universe, now I have it; the wit lies in the\r\n    jingling! All wit consists most in jingling. Hear how the glasses\r\n    rhyme to one another.... I fancy this same wine is all sold at\r\n    Will's Coffee-house.'\r\n\r\nHere we have a palpable hit at the source of inspiration indulged in\r\nby many of the wits and rhymesters who gathered round 'glorious John\r\nDryden' within the hallowed walls of that famous rendezvous. And likely\r\nenough, when they\r\n\r\n    'were all at supper, all in good humour, Champaign was the word,\r\n    and wit flew about the room like a pack of losing cards.'[294]\r\n\r\nFarquhar seems, above all others, to have hailed the new wine with\r\npleasure. We all remember the 'red Burgundy' which saves Mirabel from\r\nhis perilous position in the cut-throats' den; but the flighty hero of\r\nthe _Inconstant_ is equally enthusiastic over sparkling wine when he\r\nexclaims:\r\n\r\n    'Give me the plump Venetian, brisk and sanguine, that smiles upon\r\n    me like the glowing sun, and meets my lips like sparkling wine,\r\n    her person shining as the glass, and spirit like the foaming\r\n    liquor.'[295]\r\n\r\nThe benignant influence of the beverage is, moreover, referred to by\r\nFarquhar in his epilogue to the _Constant Couple_, where, in alluding\r\nto the critics, it is said that\r\n\r\n    'To coffee some retreat to save their pockets,\r\n    Others, more generous, damn the play at Locket's;\r\n    But there, I hope, the author's fears are vain,\r\n    Malice ne'er spoke in generous Champain.'[296]\r\n\r\nFurther, he makes Benjamin Wouldbe exclaim:\r\n\r\n    'Show me that proud stoick that can bear success and Champain;\r\n    philosophy can support us in hard fortune, but who can have\r\n    patience in prosperity?'[297]\r\n\r\nFarquhar shows his usual keen observation of the minutest features\r\nof the life of his day in his allusion to the flask--the pear-shaped\r\n_flacon_ in which Champagne made its _entrée_ into fashionable\r\nlife.[298] Archer, in his ditty on 'trifles,' thus warbles:\r\n\r\n    'A flask of Champaign, people think it\r\n        A trifle, or something as bad;\r\n    But if you'll contrive how to drink it,\r\n        You'll find it no trifle, egad!'[299]\r\n\r\nCongreve, in evident reference to the still wine, thus writes to Mr.\r\nPorter, husband of the celebrated actress, from Calais, August 11, 1700:\r\n\r\n    'Here is admirable Champaign for twelvepence a quart, as good\r\n    Burgundy for fifteenpence; and yet I have virtue enough to resolve\r\n    to leave this place to-morrow for St. Omers, where the same wine is\r\n    half as dear again, and may be not quite so good.'[300]\r\n\r\nChampagne suffered like other French wines from the War of Succession\r\nand the Methuen Treaty, by which the Government strove to pour\r\nPort wine down the throats of the people. The poets and satirists,\r\nsupported by Dean Aldrich, 'the Apostle of Bacchus;' the miserly Dr.\r\nRatcliffe, who ascribed all diseases to the lack of French wines, and\r\nimputed the badness of the vintages he was wont to place upon his\r\ntable to the difficulty he experienced in obtaining them; the jovial\r\nPortman Seymour; the rich 'smell-feast' Pereira and General Churchill,\r\nMarlborough's brother, together with a host of 'bottle companions,'\r\nlawyers, and physicians, united to fight against this attempt.[301]\r\nThey would drink their old favourites, in spite of treaties, and\r\nwould praise them as they deserved; and means were found to gratify\r\ntheir wishes. According to official returns, the nominal importation\r\nof French wines fell in 1701 to a trifle over two thousand tons; and\r\nthough this quantity was only once exceeded up to 1786, the influence\r\nof a steady demand, a short sea-passage, an extensive coast-line,\r\nand a ridiculously inefficient preventive service in aid of the high\r\nduty need to be taken into consideration. The contraband traders of\r\nthe beginning of the century smuggled French wine into England, just\r\nas they continued to do at a later period into Scotland and Ireland,\r\nwhen the taste for ardent spirits which sprang up in the Georgian era\r\nrendered the surreptitious import of 'Nantz' and 'Geneva' the more\r\nprofitable transaction as regarded England. Farquhar throws light on\r\none method pursued when Colonel Standard hands Alderman Smuggler his\r\npocket-book, which he had dropped, with the remark:\r\n\r\n    'It contains an account of some secret practices in your\r\n    merchandising, amongst the rest, the counterpart of an agreement\r\n    with a correspondent at Bordeaux about transporting French wine in\r\n    Spanish casks.'[302]\r\n\r\nThat the Champenois were themselves aware of the appreciation in which\r\ntheir wine was held in England is shown by a passage in Coffin's\r\n_Campania vindicata_. Writing in 1712, the year before the ratification\r\nof the Treaty of Utrecht, he calls on the Britons in presence of\r\nreturning peace to cross the seas, and instead of lavishing their\r\nwealth to pleasure blood-stained Mars, to fill their ships with the\r\ntreasures of the Remois Bacchus, and bear home these precious spoils\r\ninstead of fatal trophies.[303]\r\n\r\nAddison, referring to one source whence French wines were derived,\r\nremarks:\r\n\r\n    'There is in this City a certain fraternity of Chymical Operators\r\n    who work underground, in holes, caverns, and dark retirements,\r\n    to conceal their mysteries from the eyes and observation of\r\n    mankind. These subterraneous Philosophers are daily employed\r\n    in the Transmigration of Liquors, and, by the power of Magical\r\n    Drugs and Incantations, raise under the streets of _London_ the\r\n    choicest products of the hills and valleys of _France_. They can\r\n    squeeze _Bourdeaux_ out of a _Sloe_, and draw _Champagne_ from an\r\n    _Apple_.'[304]\r\n\r\nHe tells us that\r\n\r\n    'the person who appeared against them was a Merchant, who had by\r\n    him a great magazine of wines, that he had laid in before the war:\r\n    but these Gentlemen (as he said) had so vitiated the nation's\r\n    palate, that no man could believe his to be _French_, because it\r\n    did not taste like what they sold for such.'\r\n\r\nFor the defence it was urged that\r\n\r\n    'they were under a necessity of making Claret if they would keep\r\n    open their doors, it being the nature of Mankind to love everything\r\n    that is Prohibited.'[305]\r\n\r\nThe enquiry,\r\n\r\n    'And where would your beaux have Champaign to toast their\r\n    mistresses were it not for the merchant?'[306]\r\n\r\nis from a panegyrist of the more legitimate school of trade.\r\n\r\nAltogether it is tolerably certain that Champagne--genuine or\r\nfictitious, from grape or gooseberry--played a more important part in\r\nthe conviviality of the early portion of the eighteenth century than\r\nmight be supposed from the imports of the epoch, whilst there is little\r\ndoubt but that it helped to inspire some of the finest productions of\r\nthe Augustan age of English literature.\r\n\r\nGay places it first amongst the wines offered to a party of guests\r\nentering a tavern, making the drawer exclaim:\r\n\r\n    'Name, sirs, the wine that most invites your taste,\r\n    Champaign or Burgundy, or Florence pure,\r\n    Or Hock antique, or Lisbon new or old,\r\n    Bourdeaux, or neat French wine, or Alicant.'[307]\r\n\r\nThis reference to Champagne most likely relates to the still wine; but\r\nit is probably the sparkling variety which is alluded to in the verses\r\nwhich Gay addressed to Pope on the completion of the _Iliad_ in 1720,\r\nand wherein he represents General Wilkinson thus apostrophising as the\r\nship conveying the poet passes Greenwich:\r\n\r\n    'Come in, my friends, here shall ye dine and lie;\r\n        And here shall breakfast and shall dine again,\r\n    And sup and breakfast on (if ye comply),\r\n        For I have still some dozens of Champaign.'[308]\r\n\r\nWitty Mat Prior, poet and diplomatist, was always ready to manifest his\r\ncontempt for the heavy fluid with which the Methuen treaty deluged our\r\nisland in place of the light fresh-tasting wines of France that had\r\ncheered and inspired his earlier sallies. Writing whilst in custody on\r\na charge of treason between 1715 and 1717, and referring to the mind\r\nunder the name of Alma, he tells us how\r\n\r\n    'By nerves about our palate placed,\r\n    She likewise judges of the taste,\r\n    Else (dismal thought!) our warlike men\r\n    Might drink thick Port for fine Champagne.'[309]\r\n\r\nHe likewise inculcates a lesson of philosophy, especially suited to his\r\nown situation at that moment, when he remarks of fortune:\r\n\r\n    'I know we must both fortunes try,\r\n    And bear our evils, wet or dry.\r\n\r\n    Yet, let the goddess smile or frown,\r\n    Bread we shall eat, or white or brown;\r\n    And in a cottage or a court\r\n    Drink fine Champagne or muddled Port.'[310]\r\n\r\nThere were many, no doubt, ready to emulate the hero of one of his\r\nminor pieces, and\r\n\r\n                      'from this world to retreat\r\n    As full of Champagne as an egg's full of meat.'[311]\r\n\r\nShenstone gives expression to much the same sentiment as Prior when he\r\nfound 'his warmest welcome at an inn,' and wrote on the window-pane at\r\nHenley:\r\n\r\n    ''Tis here with boundless power I reign,\r\n        And every health which I begin\r\n    Converts dull Port to bright Champagne;\r\n        Such freedom crowns it at an inn.'[312]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nVanbrugh, whose writings were of a decidedly lighter character than\r\nthe edifices he erected, probably had recourse to Champagne to assist\r\nhim in the composition of the former, and neglected it when planning\r\nthe designs for the latter. These, indeed, would seem to have been\r\nconceived under the influence of some such 'heavy muddy stuff' as the\r\n'Norfolk nog,' which Lady Headpiece reproaches her husband for allowing\r\ntheir son and heir to indulge in, saying:\r\n\r\n    'Well, I wonder, Sir Francis, you will encourage that lad to swill\r\n    such beastly lubberly liquor. If it were Burgundy or Champaign,\r\n    something might be said for't; they'd perhaps give him some art and\r\n    spirit.'[313]\r\n\r\nSwift has given in his _Journal to Stella_ extensive information as\r\nto the wines in vogue in London in 1710-13. He seems for his own part\r\nto have been, as far as nature permitted him, an accommodating toper,\r\nindulging, in addition to Champagne, in Tokay, Portugal, Florence,\r\nBurgundy, Hermitage, 'Irish wine,' _i.e._ Claret, 'right French\r\nwine,' Congreve's 'nasty white wine' that gave him the heartburn, and\r\nSir William Read's 'admirable punch.' He acknowledges that the more\r\nfashionable beverages of the day were not to his taste. 'I love,'\r\nwrites he, 'white Portugal wine better than Claret, Champaign, or\r\nBurgundy. I have a sad vulgar appetite.'[314] Still, while observing\r\ndue moderation, he did not entirely shun the lighter potations with\r\nwhich the table of the luxurious and licentious St. John was so freely\r\nsupplied. On one occasion he writes:\r\n\r\n    'I dined to-day by appointment with Lord Bolingbroke; but they fell\r\n    to drinking so many Spanish healths in Champaign, that I stole away\r\n    to the ladies and drank tea till eight.'[315]\r\n\r\nAnd on another we find him refusing to allow his host to\r\n\r\n    'drink one drop of Champaign or Burgundy without water.'[316]\r\n\r\nOur countrymen do not appear to have taken heed of the controversy\r\nregarding the respective merits of Champagne and Burgundy, but\r\nthankfully accepted the goods that the gods and the sunny soil of\r\nFrance provided them. The accusation, however, banded about by the\r\npartisans of these rival vintages, of their tendency to produce gout,\r\nhad apparently been accepted as gospel truth over here in the first\r\ndecade of the century. Thus the Dean notes that he\r\n\r\n    'dined with Mr. Secretary St. John, and staid till seven, but would\r\n    not drink his Champaign and Burgundy, for fear of the gout.'[317]\r\n\r\nWhen suffering from a rheumatic pain he displays commendable caution at\r\ndinner with Mr. Domville, only drinking\r\n\r\n    'three or four glasses of Champaign by perfect teasing,'[318]\r\n\r\nfor fear of aggravating his suffering. He is prompt, however, to\r\nacknowledge himself mistaken:\r\n\r\n    'I find myself disordered with a pain all round the small of my\r\n    back, which I imputed to Champaign I had drunk, but find it to have\r\n    been only my new cold.'[319]\r\n\r\nThe Dean does not appear to have been the only sufferer, for we find\r\nhim writing:\r\n\r\n    'I called this evening to see Mr. Secretary, who had been very ill\r\n    with the gravel and pains in his back, by Burgundy and Champaign,\r\n    added to the sitting up all night at business; I found him drinking\r\n    tea, while the rest were at Champaign, and was very glad of\r\n    it.'[320]\r\n\r\nEven Pope, the perforcedly abstemious, was lured into similar excesses\r\nby the young Earl of Warwick and Colley Cibber, during his visits to\r\nLondon, whilst engaged on his translation of the _Iliad_, and writes to\r\nCongreve,\r\n\r\n    'I sit up till two o'clock over Burgundy and Champagne.'[321]\r\n\r\nA proof of the popularity of French wines at this period is found\r\nin the fact that in 1713, the year of the Peace of Utrecht, the\r\nregistered imports, despite high duties, reached 2551 tuns, an amount\r\nnot exceeded till 1786. The Treaty of Commerce, with which Bolingbroke\r\n(whose partiality to Champagne we have seen) and M. de Torcy sought to\r\nsupplement that of Peace, having fallen through, the tavern-keepers\r\nput such a price on these wines that it was only members of the\r\nfashionable world who could afford to have what was termed 'a good\r\nChampagne stomach.'[322] Their vogue is confirmed by the order given to\r\nher servant by a lady aspiring to take a leading position in the _beau\r\nmonde_ to\r\n\r\n    'go to Mr. Mixture, the wine-merchant, and order him to send in\r\n    twelve dozen of his best Champaign, twelve dozen of Burgundy, and\r\n    twelve dozen of Hermitage,'[323]\r\n\r\nas the entire stock for her cellar. 'Good wine' was indeed, in those\r\ndays, 'a gentleman.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'GOOD WINE A GENTLEMAN.']\r\n\r\nThe unvarying rule that the fashions set by the most select are\r\ninevitably aped by the most degraded, so far as lies in their power, is\r\nexemplified in the Tavern Scene of Hogarth's _Rake's Progress_, where\r\nthe table at which the hero and his _inamoratas_ are seated is set out\r\nwith the tall wine-glasses wherein\r\n\r\n    'Champaign goes briskly round.'[324]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAVERN SCENE FROM 'THE RAKE'S PROGRESS.']\r\n\r\nThe Jacobites, faithful to their traditional ally, continued to toast\r\n'the King over the water' by passing glasses charged with the sparkling\r\nwine of France across a bowl filled to the brim with the pure element.\r\nThe middle classes clung to their beer, or at most indulged in Port and\r\npunch; whilst the lower orders seem to have become seized with that\r\ninsane passion for ardent spirits which Hogarth satirised in his 'Gin\r\nLane,' and hailed with glee Sir Robert Walpole's\r\n\r\n                          'attempt,\r\n    Superior to Canary or Champagne,\r\n    Geneva salutiferous to enhance.'[325]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'THE KING OVER THE WATER.']\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe registered imports of the wines of France--though figures in this\r\nrespect are, we admit, exceedingly deceptive--show a continuous falling\r\noff, which reached its lowest ebb in 1746, during war time; and we may\r\nbe certain that when, after supper,\r\n\r\n    'Champagne was the word for two whole hours by Shrewsbury\r\n    clock,'[326]\r\n\r\nit was at the cost of a pretty penny. Although the recorded imports\r\nof French wines show but little improvement with the return of peace\r\nin 1748, we gather from other sources that the Champagne of 1749 met\r\nwith a ready market over here, and find Bertin du Rocheret writing\r\nexultingly to his friend, the Marquis de Calvières, that the Champenois\r\nwere making the English pay the cost of the war.\r\n\r\nThe voluminous correspondence of Bertin du Rocheret gives some curious\r\ninformation as to the manner in which the Champagne trade was carried\r\non with England during the second quarter of the eighteenth century.\r\nFrom 1725 to 1754 he was in constant communication with Mr. James\r\nChabane, who seems to have been the Court wine-merchant, and to whom\r\nhe despatched at first ten, but during the latter portion of their\r\ntransactions seldom more than four, pièces of wine annually during\r\nthe winter months.[327] As regards the particular vintage consumed\r\nin England, a preference evidently existed for that of Ay, though it\r\nreally appears as if Bertin was wont to introduce under this name the\r\nthen far cheaper growths of Avize. Such, at any rate, seems to have\r\nbeen the case with the parcel of wine divided, in 1754, between King\r\nGeorge in London and King Stanislas at Nancy. Referring to the wines\r\nof Hautvillers and Sillery, Bertin writes to Chabane in 1731, that a\r\nyear's notice must be given in advance to obtain them. A _liquoreux_\r\nwine was then preferred, as in 1732 he remarks, respecting the yield\r\nof the preceding year, that the English are as mad after _liqueur_ as\r\nthe French; and it is evident that the taste continued, as in 1744 he\r\nannounces the departure for London of eleven poinçons _liquoreux_.\r\n\r\nNot only was Chabane accustomed to bottle these wines, but while\r\ndoing so was able to insure to them a semi-sparkling character. With\r\nthis view Bertin tells him, in 1731, that he must not keep them in\r\ncask after the three _sèves_, or motions of the sap of April, June,\r\nor August, except in the case of a pièce from 'the _clos_' reserved\r\n'for the supply of the Court,' and intended to be drunk as still wine.\r\nSome wine despatched in 1754 is recommended to be bottled during the\r\nfirst quarter of the moon.[328] In addition to the wine thus sent\r\nin casks, Bertin was also accustomed to send his correspondent a\r\ncertain quantity in bottles. In 1725 he quotes for him 'flacons blancs\r\nmousseux liqueur,' at from 30 to 50 sols, and 'ambrés non-mousseux\r\nsablant,' at 25 sols. These flasks were all despatched to Dunkirk or\r\ninto Holland, whence they were smuggled to their ultimate destination,\r\nfor the introduction of wine in bottles into England was rigidly\r\nprohibited until the close of 1745, when it was legalised by Act of\r\nParliament.[329]\r\n\r\nHorace Walpole, who deals with men rather than manners, with sayings\r\nrather than doings, and whose forte is epigram and not description, has\r\nlittle to tell us about the drinking customs of his day. The strictly\r\ntemperate regimen that marked his later years, and rendered him unfit\r\nfor mere convivial gatherings, extended to his writings, and he seldom\r\npermits his pen to expatiate on those pleasures in which he sought no\r\nshare. Even in his letters from Reims, written in 1739, when he was\r\ndoing the grand tour, he omits all mention of the wine for which that\r\ncity is famed. Still he incidentally furnishes a few instances of the\r\nesteem in which Champagne was held by the upper classes in the middle\r\nof the eighteenth century. In a letter to George Montague, dated June\r\n23, 1750, he describes how Lord Granby joined his party at Vauxhall\r\nwhilst suffering considerably under the influence of the Champagne he\r\nhad consumed at 'Jenny's Whim,' a noted tavern at Chelsea; and writing\r\nto Sir Horace Mann, a year later, he says that the then chief subjects\r\nof conversation in London were the two Miss Gunnings and an extravagant\r\ndinner at White's.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SCENE AT VAUXHALL GARDENS\r\n\r\n(From an engraving after a drawing by Gravelot).]\r\n\r\n    'The dinner was a frolic of seven young men, who bespoke it to\r\n    the utmost extent of expense; one article was a tart made of duke\r\n    cherries, from a hothouse; and another, that they tasted but one\r\n    glass out of each bottle of Champagne. The bill of fare has got\r\n    into print, and with good people has produced the apprehension of\r\n    another earthquake.'[330]\r\n\r\nThe Earl of March, afterwards 'Old Q,' in a letter to Walpole's friend,\r\nGeorge Selwyn, in November 1766, writes: 'I have not yet received\r\nsome Champaign that Monsieur de Prissieux has sent me.'[331] And we\r\nfind Horace Walpole's fair foe, that eighteenth-century exemplar of\r\nstrong-minded womanhood, Lady Mary Wortley Montague, whose letters\r\nindicate a _penchant_ for Burgundy, acknowledging in verse the\r\nexhilarating effects of Champagne. Of the _beaux_ of 1721 she says that\r\n\r\n    'They sigh, not from the heart but from the brain,\r\n    Vapours of vanity and strong Champagne.'[332]\r\n\r\nBetter known by far are her oft-quoted lines,\r\n\r\n    'But when the long hours of the public are past,\r\n    And we meet with Champagne and a chicken at last,\r\n    May every fond pleasure that moment endear,\r\n    Be banished afar both discretion and fear,'[333]\r\n\r\nwhich drew from Byron the terror-stricken comment, 'What say you to\r\nsuch a supper with such a woman?'[334]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDuring the third quarter of the eighteenth century a cloud dims the\r\nlustre of Champagne. It was then looked upon by a vast majority as\r\nonly a fit accompaniment to masquerades, ridottos, ultra-fashionable\r\ndinners, and Bacchanalian suppers. 'The Champaign made some eyes\r\nsparkle that nothing else could brighten,'[335] says the contemporary\r\naccount of one of those scenes of shameless revelry held under the\r\ntitle of masquerades at the Pantheon, and the orgies that, under\r\nthe auspices of Mrs. Cornelys, disgraced Carlisle House were mainly\r\ninspired by the consumption of the same wine. The citizens of the\r\nGeorgian era, who had lost the tastes of their fathers, hated French\r\nwines simply because they were French; and the hundred thousand gallons\r\nimported on an average annually from 1750 to 1786 were entirely\r\nconsumed amongst the upper or the dissipated classes. Though smuggling\r\nwas still looked upon as patriotic, if not loyal, those engaged in it\r\nhad discovered that, thanks to the combined effects of duty and demand,\r\nNantes brandy and Hollands gin paid better. What, indeed, is to be\r\nthought of the taste of an era that produced poets whose muse sought\r\ninspiration in punch, and who had the sublime audacity to extol the rum\r\nof the West Indies above the produce of 'Marne's flowery banks'?[336]\r\nOnly a few of the higher-class men, however, engaged in literature and\r\nart seem to have retained a preference for French wine. The accounts of\r\nthe Literary Club established by Sir Joshua Reynolds show the average\r\nconsumption at each sitting to have been half a bottle of Port and a\r\nbottle of Claret per head. Johnson drank Port mixed with sugar from\r\nabout 1752 to 1764; became a total abstainer until 1781, and then seems\r\nto have given the preference to Madeira.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE LITERARY CLUB.]\r\n\r\nIn contemporaneous comedy we are pretty sure to find the mirror held\r\nup to fashion, if not to Nature; and turning to the playwrights of\r\nthat day, it is easy to cull a few confirmatory excerpts. Thus we have\r\nSterling, the ambitious British merchant, in order to do honour to his\r\nnoble guests, preparing to\r\n\r\n    'give them such a glass of Champaign as they never drank in their\r\n    lives; no, not at a duke's table.'[337]\r\n\r\nWhile Lord Minikin, the peer of fashion, makes his entrance on the\r\nstage, exclaiming:\r\n\r\n    'O my head! I must absolutely change my wine-merchant; I cannot\r\n    taste his Champaigne without disordering myself for a week.'[338]\r\n\r\nOn Miss Tittup inquiring if his depression is due to losses at cards,\r\nhe replies,\r\n\r\n    'No, faith, our Champaigne was not good yesterday.'[339]\r\n\r\nJessamy, his lordship's valet, profits of course by so aristocratic an\r\nexample; and when speaking of his exploits at the masquerade, says,\r\n\r\n    'I was in tip-top spirits, and had drunk a little too freely of the\r\n    Champaigne, I believe.'[340]\r\n\r\nWith Philip the butler, 'Burgundy is the word,' and from the choicest\r\nvintages of his master's cellar he places on the table 'Claret,\r\nBurgundy, and Champaign; and a bottle of Tokay for the ladies;'[341]\r\nwhile Port is characterised by the Duke's servant as 'only fit for a\r\ndram.'[342] Mrs. Circuit presses the guests at a clandestinely-given\r\nrepast to 'taste the Champagne;' and her husband, the Sergeant, is\r\nsurprised on his return home to find that they have been so indulging:\r\n\r\n    'Delicate eating, in truth; and the wine [_Drinks_] Champagne, as\r\n    I live! Must have t'other glass ... delicate white wine, indeed! I\r\n    like it better every glass.'[343]\r\n\r\nSuch is his comment.\r\n\r\nThe effects of the wine are characterised in the following fashion by\r\nGarrick, when Sparkish, entering, according to the stage directions,\r\n'fuddled,' declares that\r\n\r\n    'when a man has wit, and a great deal of it, Champaign gives it a\r\n    double edge, and nothing can withstand it; 'tis a lighted match to\r\n    gunpowder; the mine is sprung, and the poor devils are tossed heels\r\n    uppermost in an instant.'[344]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LORD MINIKIN.]\r\n\r\nWe greet, too, what was perhaps the first appearance of a joke now\r\ngrown venerable in its antiquity in a farce of Foote's, the scene of\r\nwhich is laid at Bath. He introduces us to a party of pseudo-invalids\r\ndevoting their whole time and attention to conviviality, recruiting\r\ntheir debilitated stomachs with turtle and venison, and alternating\r\nBath waters with the choicest vintages, so that the hero Racket is fain\r\nto observe to one of them,\r\n\r\n    'My dear Sir Kit, how often has Dr. Carawitchet told you that your\r\n    rich food and Champaigne would produce nothing but poor health and\r\n    real pain?'[345]\r\n\r\nAnd how many gentlemen in difficulties have not since followed the\r\nexample set by Harry Dornton in the spunging-house, and ordered, as a\r\nconsolation,\r\n\r\n    'a bottle of Champagne and two rummers'![346]\r\n\r\nTurning from fancy to fact, we find Sir Edward Barry furnishing some\r\nparticulars respecting the Champagne wines consumed in England during\r\nthe latter half of the last century.[347] He informs us at the outset\r\nthat\r\n\r\n    'the wines of Champaign and Burgundy are made with more care than\r\n    any other French wines; and the vaults in which the former are\r\n    preserved are better than any other in France. These wines, from\r\n    their finer texture and peculiar flavour, cannot be adulterated\r\n    without the fraud being easily discovered, and are therefore\r\n    generally imported pure, or by proper care may be certainly\r\n    procured in that state.'\r\n\r\nHis remarks evidently refer to the still wines, as he proceeds to\r\nexplain that 'the Champaign River Wines are more delicate and pale than\r\nthose which are distinguished from them by the name of Mountain gray\r\nWines,' the latter being more durable and better suited for exportation,\r\nwhilst the former, if allowed to remain too long in the cask, acquire a\r\ntaste from the wood, although keeping in flasks from four to six years\r\nwithout harm. Referring to the taste of the day, he explains that\r\n\r\n    'among the River Wines the Auvillers and Epernay are most esteemed,\r\n    and among the Mountain Wines the Selery and St. Thyery, and in\r\n    general such as are of the colour of a partridge's eye. These are\r\n    likewise distinguished for their peculiar grateful pungency and\r\n    balsamic softness, which is owing to the refined saline principle\r\n    which prevails more in them than in the Burgundy Wines, on which\r\n    account they are less apt to affect the head, communicate a milder\r\n    heat, and more freely pervade and pass through the vessels of the\r\n    body.... To drink Champaign Wines in the greatest perfection, the\r\n    flask should be taken from the vault a quarter of an hour before it\r\n    is drunk, and immersed in ice-water, with the cork so loose in it\r\n    as is sufficient to give a free passage to the air, and yet prevent\r\n    too great an evaporation of its spirituous parts.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HIGH LIVING AT BATH\r\n\r\n(After Rowlandson, in the _New Bath Guide_).]\r\n\r\nThe foregoing practice still obtains with Sillery, classed by Barry as\r\nthe first of the Mountain growths, and in the highest favour in England\r\nthroughout the remainder of the century. Regarding sparkling wine, of\r\nwhich he was evidently no admirer, he adds:\r\n\r\n    'For some years the French and English have been particularly fond\r\n    of the sparkling frothy Champaigns. The former have almost entirely\r\n    quitted that depraved taste, nor does it now so much prevail here.\r\n    They used to mix some ingredients to give them that quality; but\r\n    this is unnecessary, as they are too apt spontaneously to run into\r\n    that state; but whoever chooses to have such Wines may be assured\r\n    that they will acquire it by bottling them any time after the\r\n    vintage before the month of the next May; and the most sure rule to\r\n    prevent that disposition is not to bottle them before the November\r\n    following. This rule has been confirmed by repeated experiments.'\r\n\r\nOn the signature of the Treaty of Peace with France in 1783, it had\r\nbeen stipulated that a Treaty of Commerce should likewise be concluded;\r\nand in 1786, under the auspices of Pitt, a treaty of this character was\r\nmade, the first article providing that 'The wines of France imported\r\ndirectly from France into Great Britain shall in no case pay any\r\nhigher duties than those which the wines of Portugal now pay.' Pitt,\r\nspite of his well known _penchant_ for Port, had yet a sneaking liking\r\nfor Champagne, arising no doubt from his early familiarity with the\r\nwine when he went to Reims to study, after leaving the University of\r\nCambridge. It was with Champagne that he was primed on the memorable\r\noccasion when he, Lord Chancellor Thurlow, and Mr. Secretary Dundas\r\ngalloped after dusk through an open turnpike-gate without paying toll,\r\nand only just missed receiving the contents of a loaded blunderbuss,\r\nwhich the turnpike man, fancying they were highwaymen, fired after\r\nthem. The party had been dining with the President of the Board of\r\nTrade at Addiscombe, and a rhymester of the epoch commemorated the\r\nincident in the following lines:\r\n\r\n    'How as Pitt wandered darkling o'er the plain,\r\n    His reason drowned in Jenkinson's Champagne,\r\n    A rustic's hand, but righteous fate withstood,\r\n    Had shed a premier's for a robber's blood.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DUNDAS AND PITT AS SILENUS AND BACCHUS\r\n\r\n(After Gilray).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WILLIAM PITT\r\n\r\n(After Gilray).]\r\n\r\nTickell has noted the appreciation of Brooks' Champagne shown by Pitt's\r\ngreat rival in the lines addressed to Sheridan, and purporting to be an\r\ninvitation to supper from Fox. The illustrious member for Westminster\r\npromises his guest that\r\n\r\n    'Derby shall send, if not his plate, his cooks,\r\n    And know I've bought the best Champaign from Brooks.'[348]\r\n\r\nBrooks' Club enjoyed a high reputation for its Champagne, and we find\r\nFighting Fitzgerald emptying three bottles there without assistance,\r\nthe same evening on which he bullied the members into electing him.[349]\r\n\r\nThe year after the Treaty of Commerce was signed, we have an anonymous\r\nwriter remarking[350] that in time of peace the English drew large\r\nquantities of wine from Bordeaux and Nantes, and that the other French\r\nwines they were in the habit of consuming were those of Mantes,\r\nBurgundy, and Champagne, shipped respectively from Rouen, Dunkirk, and\r\nCalais. Arthur Young, writing at the same time, remarks, _apropos_\r\nof Champagne, that the trade with England 'used to be directly from\r\nEpernay; but now the wine is sent to Calais, Boulogne, Montreuil,\r\nand Guernsey, in order to be passed into England they suppose here\r\nby smuggling. This may explain our Champagne not being so good as\r\nformerly.'[351] It is to be hoped that neither Arthur Young nor other\r\nconnoisseurs of Champagne had been enticed into drinking as the genuine\r\narticle any of the produce of the vineyard which the Hon. Charles\r\nHamilton had planted with the Auvernat grape near Cobham, in Surrey,\r\nand which was said to yield a wine 'resembling Champagne.'[352]\r\n\r\nThe reduction of duty consequent upon the treaty as a matter of course\r\nlargely increased the importation of French wine. Respecting the taste\r\nfor Champagne then prevailing in England, and the price the wine\r\ncommanded, a few interesting particulars are afforded by the early\r\ncorrespondence and account-books of Messrs. Moët & Chandon of Epernay,\r\nwhich we have courteously been permitted to inspect. From these we find\r\nthat in October 1788 the Chevalier Colebrook, writing in French to\r\nthe firm from Bath, asks that seventy-two bottles of Champagne may be\r\nsent to his friend, the Hon. John Butler of Molesworth-street, Dublin,\r\n'who, if content with the wine, will become a very good customer, being\r\nrich, keeping a good house, and receiving many amateurs of _vin de\r\nChampagne_.' The writer is no doubt the 'M. Collebrock' to whom the\r\nfirm shortly afterwards forward fifty bottles of '_vin non mousseux_,\r\n1783,' on his own account. Messrs. Carbonnell, Moody, & Walker,\r\npredecessors of the well-known existing firm of Carbonnell & Co.,\r\nLondon, in a letter dated November 1788, and also written in French,\r\nsay: 'If you can supply us with some Champagne of a very good body, not\r\ntoo much charged with liqueur, but with an excellent flavour, and not\r\nat all _moussu_, we beg you to send two ten dozen baskets. Also, if you\r\nhave any dry Champagne of very good flavour, solidity, and excellent\r\nbody, send two baskets of the same size.'\r\n\r\nThe taste of the day was evidently for a full-bodied non-sparkling\r\nwine; and this is confirmed by Jeanson, Messrs. Moët's traveller in\r\nEngland, who writes from London in May 1790: 'How the taste of this\r\ncountry has altered within the last ten years! Almost everywhere they\r\nask for a dry wine; but they want a wine so vinous and so strong,\r\nthat there is hardly anything but Sillery that will satisfy them.'\r\nAdditional confirmation is found in a letter, written from London in\r\nMay 1799 to Messrs. Moët, by a Mr. John Motteux, complaining of delay\r\nin the delivery of a parcel of wine said to have been sent off by way\r\nof Havre, and very likely destined to be surreptitiously introduced\r\ninto England _viâ_ Guernsey. He asks for a further supply of Sillery,\r\nif its safe arrival can be guaranteed, and remarks, 'There is nothing\r\nto be compared to Sillery when it is genuine; it must not have the\r\nleast sweetness nor _mousse_.'[353]\r\n\r\nDuring the great French war, patriotism and increased duties might have\r\nbeen expected to check the import of French wines; yet, if statistics\r\nare worth anything, the reverse would appear to have been the case.\r\nThe registered imports, which from 1770 to 1786 had fluctuated between\r\n80,000 and 125,000 gallons, rose during the last fourteen years of the\r\ncentury to an average of 550,000 gallons per annum. In those fighting,\r\nrollicking, hard-drinking times, when it was a sacred social duty to\r\ntoast 'great George our King' on every possible occasion, Champagne\r\ncontinued to be 'the wine of fashion.' The sparkling variety was\r\nterribly costly, no doubt, and was often doled out, as Mr. Walker\r\nrelates, 'like drops of blood.'[354] But whilst the stanch admirers of\r\nPort might profess to despise Champagne as effeminate, and the 'loyal\r\nvolunteers' condemn it as the produce of a foeman's soil, there were\r\nplenty to sing in honour of 'The Fair of Britain's Isle:'\r\n\r\n    'Fill, fill the glass, to beauty charge,\r\n        And banish care from every breast;\r\n    In brisk Champaign we'll quick discharge,\r\n        A toast shall give the wine a zest.'[355]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the greatest of England's naval heroes was not insensible to\r\nthe attractions of this gift from 'our sweet enemy France.' In October\r\n1800 Nelson, together with Sir William and Lady Hamilton, was a guest\r\nof Mr. Elliot, the British Resident at Dresden. At dinner Lady Hamilton\r\ndrank more Champagne than the narrator of this little incident imagined\r\nit was possible for a woman to consume, and inspired thereby, insisted\r\non favouring the company with her imitations of classical statuary.\r\nNelson thereupon got uproarious, and went on emptying bumper after\r\nbumper of the same fluid in honour of the fair Emma, and swearing that\r\nshe was superior to Siddons. The host kept striving 'to prevent the\r\nfurther effusion of Champagne,' but did not succeed till Sir William\r\nin his turn had astonished all present with a display of his social\r\ntalents. The grave diplomatist lay down on his back, with his arms and\r\nlegs in the air, and in this position bounded all round the room like a\r\nball, with his stars and ribbons flying around him.[356]\r\n\r\nIf we may give credit to Tom Moore, 'the best wigged prince in\r\nChristendom,' who was subsequently to 'd---- Madeira as gouty,' and\r\nbring Sherry into fashion, preferred stronger potations than those\r\nproduced on the banks of the Marne. In one of the poet's political\r\nskits the Prince is introduced soliloquising _à la_ Jemmy Thompson--\r\n\r\n    'O Roman Punch! O potent Curaçoa!\r\n    O Maraschino! Maraschino O!\r\n    Delicious drams'[357]--\r\n\r\nand describing his favourite luncheon as 'good mutton cutlets and\r\nstrong curaçoa.'[358] Nevertheless, the First Gentleman in Europe\r\ndid consume Champagne; but it was concentrated in the form of punch,\r\nespecially devised for him, and indulged in by him in company with\r\nBarrymore, Hanger, and their fellows.[359]\r\n\r\nHis sometime model and subsequent victim, poor Brummell, is said to\r\nhave put the wine to a still more ignoble use. One day a youthful beau\r\napproached the great master in the arts of dress and deportment, and\r\nsaid, 'Permit me to ask you where you get your blacking?' 'Ah,' replied\r\nBrummell, gazing complacently at his boots, 'my blacking positively\r\nruins me. I will tell you in confidence it is made with the finest\r\nChampagne.'[360] Probably the great dandy was merely quizzing his\r\ninterlocutor, though such an act of extravagance would have been a pull\r\non even the longest purse in those days, 'your bottle of Champagne in\r\nthe year 1814 costing you a guinea.'[361]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PRINCE REGENT\r\n\r\n(After Gilray).]\r\n\r\nAs to the Prince Regent's brothers, we know that the Duke of York\r\nwas such a powerful toper, that 'six bottles of Claret after dinner\r\nscarce made a perceptible change in his countenance,'[362] and remember\r\nthe Duke of Clarence making his appearance at the table of the Royal\r\nhousehold at Windsor, and getting so helplessly drunk on Champagne as\r\nto be utterly incapable of keeping his promise to open the ball that\r\nevening with his sister Mary.[363] Two prominent orators of that day\r\nare credited with _mots_ upon Champagne. Curran said, _apropos_ of the\r\nrapid but transient intoxication produced by this wine, that 'Champagne\r\nmade a runaway rap at a man's head;' while Canning maintained that any\r\nman who said he really liked dry Champagne simply lied.\r\n\r\nAfter Waterloo, although a few _gourmets_ continued to prefer the\r\nstill wine, sparkling Champagne became the almost universally accepted\r\nvariety. Nevertheless, Henderson, while noting that 'by Champagne wine\r\nis usually understood a sparkling or frothy liquor,' gives the foremost\r\nplace to the wine of Sillery, which, he remarks, 'has always been in\r\nmuch request in England, probably on account of its superior strength\r\nand durable quality.' He extols the Ay wine as 'an exquisite liquor,\r\nlighter and sweeter than the Sillery, and accompanied by a delicate\r\nflavour and aroma somewhat analogous to that of the pine-apple.'[364]\r\n\r\nThe poets of the first half of the present century have hardly done\r\njustice to Champagne. Tom Moore, the most Anacreontic of them all,\r\nalthough ready, like his Grecian prototype, to 'pledge the universe in\r\nwine,' the merits of which he was continually chanting in the abstract,\r\nhas seldom been so invidious as to particularise any especial vintage.\r\nChampagne, the wine of all others best fitted to inspire his bright\r\nand sparkling lyrics, has received but scant attention in his earlier\r\nproductions. Bob Fudge, writing from Paris in 1818, is made to speak\r\napprovingly of Beaune and Chambertin, but only mentions Champagne as a\r\nvehicle in which to _sauter_ kidneys;[365] and in the _Sceptic_ it is\r\nsimply brought in to point a moral respecting the senses:\r\n\r\n    'Habit so mars them, that the Russian swain\r\n    Will sigh for train-oil while he sips Champagne.'[366]\r\n\r\nIn two instances only the poet who sang in such lively numbers of woman\r\nand wine pointedly refers to the vintage of the Champagne. One is when\r\nhe says:\r\n\r\n    'If ever you've seen a party\r\n        Relieved from the presence of Ned,\r\n    How instantly joyous and hearty\r\n        They've grown when the damper was fled.\r\n    You may guess what a gay piece of work,\r\n        What delight to Champagne it must be,\r\n    To get rid of its bore of a cork,\r\n        And come sparkling to you, love, and me.'[367]\r\n\r\nAnd his description of a summer _fête_ is indeed\r\n\r\n                  'a mere terrestrial strain\r\n    Inspired by naught but pink Champagne;'[368]\r\n\r\nsuch as might be penned\r\n\r\n    'While as the sparkling juice of France\r\n        High in the crystal brimmers flowed,\r\n    Each sunset ray, that mixed by chance\r\n        With the wine's diamond, showed\r\n    How sunbeams may be taught to dance;'[369]\r\n\r\nwith the final result that\r\n\r\n    'Thus did Fancy and Champagne\r\n        Work on the sight their dazzling spells,\r\n    Till nymphs that looked at noonday plain\r\n        Now brightened in the gloom to belles.'[370]\r\n\r\nMoore's Diary, however, proves that if he did not care to praise\r\nthe wine in verse, it was not for want of opportunities of becoming\r\nacquainted with it. Witness his 'odd dinner in a borrowed room' at\r\nHorace Twiss's in Chancery-lane, with the strangely incongruous\r\naccompaniments of 'Champagne, pewter spoons, and old Lady Cork.'[371]\r\n\r\nAs to that most convivial of songsters, Captain Charles Morris,\r\npoet-laureate of the Ancient Society of Beefsteaks, he labours under\r\na similar reproach. Though he has filled several hundred octavo pages\r\nof his _Lyra Urbanica_ with verses in praise of wine, the liquor\r\nwith which he crowns 'the mantling goblet,' 'the fancy-stirring\r\nbowl,' or 'the soul-subliming cup,' usually figures under some such\r\nfanciful designation as 'the inspiring juice,' 'the cordial of life,'\r\nor 'Bacchus' balm.' Champagne he evidently ignores as a beverage of\r\nGallic origin, utterly unfitted for the praise of so true a Briton as\r\nhimself; and the only vintage which he does condescend to mention with\r\napprobation is the favourite one of our beef-eating, hard-drinking,\r\nfrog-hating forefathers, 'old Oporto' from 'the stout Lusitanian vine.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPTAIN CHARLES MORRIS (After Gilray).]\r\n\r\nStrange as it may seem, the manlier Muse of Scott used at times to dip\r\nher wing into the Champagne cup, although she has failed to express any\r\nverbal gratitude to this source of inspiration. 'In truth,' says his\r\nbiographer, 'he liked no wines except sparkling Champaign and Claret;\r\nbut even as to this last he was no connoisseur, and sincerely preferred\r\na tumbler of whisky-toddy to the most precious liquid ruby that ever\r\nflowed in the cup of a prince. He rarely took any other potation when\r\nalone with his family; but at the Sunday board he circulated the\r\nChampaign briskly during dinner, and considered a pint of Claret each\r\nman's fair share afterwards.'[372] Scott himself, wearied with a round\r\nof London festivities, is impelled to write, 'I begin to tire of my\r\ngaieties. I wish for a sheep's head and whisky-toddy against all the\r\nFrench cookery and Champaign in the world.'[373] Lockhart, in his\r\n_Life of Scott_, notes the excellent flavour of some Champagne sent\r\nto Abbotsford by a French admirer of the Northern Wizard in return\r\nfor a set of his works, and more than once incidentally refers to the\r\npresence of the wine at Scott's table on festive gatherings.\r\n\r\nByron, who furnished in the course of his career a practical\r\nexemplification of the maxim that\r\n\r\n                                  'Comus all allows\r\n    Champaign, dice, music, or your neighbour's spouse,'[374]\r\n\r\ndid the vintage of the Marne justice in his verses. In _Don Juan_ he\r\nshows himself not insensible to the charms of\r\n\r\n              'Champagne with foaming whirls\r\n    As white as Cleopatra's melted pearls.'[375]\r\n\r\nThe wine, moreover, furnishes two striking comparisons in that\r\npoem--one when he observes that\r\n\r\n    'The evaporation of a joyous day\r\n        Is like the last glass of Champagne, without\r\n    The foam which made its virgin bumper gay;'[376]\r\n\r\nand the other, where, in his sketch of Lady Adeline Amundeville, he\r\nrejects the trite metaphor of the snow-covered volcano in favour of\r\n\r\n                  'a bottle of Champagne\r\n    Frozen into a very vinous ice,\r\n        Which leaves few drops of that immortal rain;\r\n    Yet in the very centre, past all price,\r\n        About a liquid glassful will remain;\r\n    And this is stronger than the strongest grape\r\n    Could e'er express in its expanded shape:\r\n\r\n    'Tis the whole spirit brought to a quintessence;\r\n      And thus the chilliest aspects may concentre\r\n    A hidden nectar under a cold presence.'[377]\r\n\r\nAlthough we find Henderson remarking, in 1822, that\r\n\r\n    'the pink Champagne is less in request than the colourless, and has\r\n    in fact nothing to entitle it to the preference,'\r\n\r\nyet wine of this tint continued to reappear from time to time, securing\r\na transitory popularity from its attractive appearance, which caused\r\nit to be likened to the dying reflection of the setting sun on a clear\r\nstream. An interesting incident in connection with its advent on one\r\nof these occasions at the table of Rogers, the banker-poet, has been\r\nrecorded by Mr. R. A. Tracy Gould of the American Bar. He was dining,\r\nit seems, in company with Tom Moore and John Kenyon, with Rogers at\r\nSt. James's-place, when their host, who had recently received through\r\nthe French Ambassador a present of a case of pink Champagne from Louis\r\nPhilippe, had the first bottle of it produced at the end of the dinner.\r\nThe saucer-shaped Champagne glasses were then just coming into use, and\r\npink Champagne, which was a revived novelty in England at that moment,\r\nlooked singularly beautiful in them, crowned with its snow-white foam.\r\nKenyon, who, as Gould remarks, was nothing if not declamatory, held up\r\nhis glass, and apostrophised it as follows:\r\n\r\n    'Lily on liquid roses floating!\r\n        So floats yon foam o'er pink Champagne!\r\n    Fain would I join such pleasant boating,\r\n        And prove that ruby main,\r\n            And float away on wine!'\r\n\r\nThis being vociferously applauded, after a few minutes' pause he added\r\nthe second verse:\r\n\r\n    'Those seas are dangerous, graybeards swear,\r\n        Whose sea-beach is the goblet's brim;\r\n    And here it is they drown dull Care--\r\n        But what care we for him?\r\n            So we but float on wine!'\r\n\r\nOn being desired to continue, Kenyon declared that he had done his\r\npart, and that it was now the turn of some one else. Moore and\r\nRogers both claimed exemption, as being on the 'retired list' of\r\nthe Parnassian army, and peremptorily demanded a contribution from\r\nthe Transatlantic guest, Tracy Gould, who thereupon, with 'great\r\ndiffidence,' as he tells us, delivered himself of the third and fourth\r\nstanzas:\r\n\r\n    'Gray Time shall pause and smooth his wrinkles,\r\n        Bright garlands round his scythe shall twine;\r\n    While sands from out his glass he sprinkles,\r\n        To fill it up with wine--\r\n            With rosy sparkling wine!\r\n\r\n    Thus hours shall pass which no man reckons,\r\n        'Mongst us, who, glad with mirth divine,\r\n    Heed not the shadowy hand that beckons\r\n        Across the sea of wine--\r\n            Of billowy gushing wine!'\r\n\r\nKenyon then added another stanza, which suggested a final verse to the\r\nAmerican:\r\n\r\n    'And though 'tis true they cross in pain,\r\n        Who sober cross the Stygian ferry,\r\n    Yet only make our Styx Champagne,\r\n        And we shall cross right merry,\r\n            Floating away on wine!'\r\n\r\n    'Old Charon's self shall make him mellow,\r\n        Then gaily row his bark from shore;\r\n    While we and every jolly fellow\r\n        Hear unconcerned the oar\r\n            That dips itself in wine!'\r\n\r\nBy this time the inspiration and the Champagne were alike exhausted.\r\n\r\nThe history of Champagne in England during the latter half of the\r\npresent century may be briefly summed up in the assertion of the\r\never-growing popularity of the wine, and the high repute attained\r\nby certain brands, which it would be invidious to particularise.\r\nIts success in oiling the wheels of social life is so great and so\r\nuniversally acknowledged that its eclipse would almost threaten a\r\ncollapse of our social system. We cannot open a railway, launch a\r\nvessel, inaugurate a public edifice, start a newspaper, entertain a\r\ndistinguished foreigner, invite a leading politician to favour us with\r\nhis views on things in general, celebrate an anniversary, or specially\r\nappeal on behalf of a benevolent institution without a banquet, and\r\nhence without the aid of Champagne, which, at the present day, is the\r\nobligatory adjunct of all such repasts.\r\n\r\nWhen the Municipality of London welcome the Khan of Kamschatka to our\r\nshores and to the Guildhall, Champagne flows in the proverbial buckets\r\nfull. When the Master and Wardens of the Coalscuttle-Makers' Company\r\nbid the Livery to one of their periodical feasts, scandal says that\r\neven this measure is exceeded. When Sir Fusby Guttleton gives one of\r\nhis noted 'little spreads' at Greenwich, are not torrents of iced\r\n'dry' needed to quench the thirst excited by the devilled bait? Aware,\r\ntoo, of the unloosening effect the wine exercises upon the strings of\r\nboth heart and purse, Pomposo, as chairman at the annual festival of\r\nthe Decayed Muffinmongers' Asylum, is careful to see that the glasses\r\nof the guests have been well charged with it before he commences his\r\nstirring appeal on behalf of that deserving institution.\r\n\r\nDoes Ingenioso wish to introduce to the notice of the British public\r\na new heating-power or lighting-apparatus or ice-making machinery, he\r\nstraightway issues cards for a private view to critics and cognoscenti,\r\nand is careful that these shall observe the merits of his invention\r\nthrough the medium of a glass--bubbling over with Champagne. So it is\r\nat the openings of the latest extension of the Mugby Junction Railway\r\nand of the Palatial Hotel, at the private view of the Amicable Afghans,\r\nor Tinto's new picture, or any one of Crotchet's manifold inventions.\r\nIf the bidding, too, flags at a sale of shorthorns or thoroughbreds, at\r\na wink from the auctioneer the Champagne-corks are set a-popping, and\r\nadvance promptly follows advance in responsive echoes.\r\n\r\nNot less important is the part that Champagne plays in the City. Capel\r\nCrash, the great financier, literally _floats_ the concerns he deigns\r\nto 'promote' by its agency. When Consol, the millionaire, makes one of\r\na set for rigging the market, and the 'ring' thus formed has reaped the\r\nreward of their ingenuity, does he not entertain his intimate friends\r\nwith the story and with the choicest Champagne? The amount of business,\r\nmoreover, transacted by the aid of the wine is incalculable. Bargains\r\nin stocks and shares, tea and sugar, cotton and corn, hemp and iron,\r\nhides and tallow, broadcloth and shoddy, are clinched by its agency. On\r\nthe other hand, many a bit of sharp practice has been forgiven, many a\r\nhard bargain has been forgotten, many a smouldering resentment has been\r\nquenched for ever, and many an enmity healed and a friendship cemented,\r\nover a bottle of Champagne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'I say, old fellow, how do you go to the Derby this\r\nyear?'\r\n\r\n'O, the old way--hamper-and-four.'\r\n\r\n(From a drawing by John Leech in 'Punch.')]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT THE DERBY\r\n\r\n(From a drawing by John Leech in 'Punch.')]\r\n\r\nThe Turf is said to be our national pastime, and no one will deny\r\nthe close connection existing between sport and Champagne. From the\r\nhighest to the lowest of that wonderful agglomeration of individuals\r\ninterested in equine matters, it is recognised as the only standard\r\n'tipple.' Champagne goes down to the Derby in its hamper-and-four, like\r\nother pertinacious patrons of the race, and its all but ubiquitous\r\npresence on the course is warmly welcomed by thousands of thirsty\r\nvisitors of very various grades. At Ascot, does H. R. H. the Prince of\r\nWales seek to congratulate the Marquis of Hartington on his success,\r\nit is by wishing him further success in a glass of sparkling wine.\r\nDoes Mr. William Kurr, welsher, desire to make the acquaintance of Mr.\r\nDruscovitch, detective, he seeks an introduction from Mr. Meiklejohn\r\nover a bottle of 'fiz.' Does the favourite horse win--quick, fill high\r\nthe bowl with sparkling wine, to celebrate his triumph; does he lose,\r\nthe same vintage will serve to drown our sorrows and obliterate the\r\nrecollection of our losses. How many cunning _coups_, how many clever\r\ncombinations, have there not been worked out in all their details over\r\na bottle of 'Cham.' in quiet hotel-parlours at Doncaster or Newmarket!\r\nHow many bets have been laid and paid in the same medium! How many a\r\njockey has been bought, and how many a race has been sold, owing to the\r\nmoral as well as physical obliquity of vision which the ingurgitation\r\nof the wine has induced! Nor should the existence of Champagne Stakes\r\nbe forgotten. There are now several races of this name at different\r\nmeetings; but the oldest is that established at Doncaster in 1828, and\r\ntaking its title from the fact of the owner of the winner having to\r\npresent six dozen of Champagne to the Doncaster Club.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: _Jones_: 'I say, Brown, things are deuced bad in the\r\nCity.'\r\n\r\n_Brown_: 'Then I'm deuced glad I'm at Epsom.'\r\n\r\n(From a drawing by John Leech in 'Punch.')]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AT THE STAR AND GARTER, RICHMOND.]\r\n\r\nLook, too, at the influence exercised by the wine on the British drama,\r\nor rather on what to-day passes as such. Plagioso the playwright freely\r\nopens a bottle of Champagne with the object of stimulating the wit of\r\nhis friend and collaborateur in the task of adapting Messrs. Meilhac\r\n& Halévy's latest production to the London stage. Adverse critics,\r\nmoreover, are said to be mollified by the subjugating influence of the\r\nwine; while authors, enraged at the way in which their pieces have been\r\n'cut,' are similarly soothed; squabbles too between rival _artistes_\r\nas to parts and lengths are satisfactorily arranged in the managerial\r\nsanctum over a bottle of fiz. Does Lord Nortiboy wish to smooth over a\r\ntiff with the tow-haired young lady who is making ducks and drakes of\r\nhis money at the Gynarchic Theatre, and whose partiality for sparkling\r\nwine is notorious, a dinner at Richmond and floods of 'Cham' for\r\nherself and friends is the plan that naturally suggests itself. Should\r\nthe enterprising lessees of the Chansonnette Theatre determine to\r\ncelebrate the thousand and first night of the run of _Their Girls_, a\r\nChampagne supper is recognised as the fit and proper method of doing\r\nso. Supper is the favourite meal of the profession, and Champagne is of\r\ncourse the best of all wine to take at that repast. On the stage itself\r\nit has often proved of very serious service. Robust tragedians and\r\nprima donnas in good training may indulge in stout, as more 'mellering\r\nto the organ;' but by the judicious administration of Champagne many a\r\nnervous _débutant_ has been encouraged to conquer 'stage fright' and to\r\nface the footlights, many a jaded _tragédienne_ enabled to rally her\r\nfainting energies in the last act, and to carry her audience with her\r\nin a final outburst of pathos or passion.\r\n\r\nStatesmen no longer prime themselves with Port before strolling down\r\nto the House, till they get into the condition of the two members, one\r\nof whom averred that he could not see any Speaker in the chair, whilst\r\nthe other gravely accounted for the phenomenon of this disappearance\r\nby asserting that, for his part, he saw a couple. Perhaps it is to be\r\nregretted that the records of the 'tea-room' do not vouch for a larger\r\nconsumption of Champagne, as then perhaps the reporters overnight and\r\ntheir readers the nest morning might escape the wearisome reiteration\r\nof purposeless recrimination and threadbare platitudes. Such should\r\ncertainly be the case, since the power of the wine as an incentive to\r\nbrisk and sparkling conversation has been universally acknowledged in\r\nsocial life.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: 'Now, George, my boy, there's a glass of Champagne for\r\nyou. Don't get such stuff at school, eh?'\r\n\r\n'H'm! Awfully sweet. Very good sort for ladies. But I've arrived at a\r\ntime of life when I confess I like my wine dry.'\r\n\r\n(From a drawing by John Leech in 'Punch.')]\r\n\r\nTo the dinners of Bloomsbury and Belgravia, as well as the suppers of\r\nBohemia, Champagne imparts a charm peculiarly its own by placing all\r\nthere present _en rapport_. The modern mind may well look back with\r\nshuddering horror to that dreary period when Champagne, if given at\r\nall, was doled out at dinner-parties 'like drops of blood.' No wonder\r\nthe ladies used to fly from the table and the gentlemen to slide\r\nunderneath it. And, speaking of the ladies, is not Champagne their wine\r\n_par excellence_? How would the fragile products of modern civilisation\r\nbe able to outdo the most robust of their ancestresses--whose highest\r\nsaltatory feats were the execution of the slow and stately minuet,\r\nthe formal quadrille with its frequent rests, or at most the romping\r\ncountry dance--by whirling almost uninterruptedly in the mazes of the\r\ngiddy waltz from nine in the evening until five in the morning, without\r\nthe sustaining power the sparkling fluid affords them? Has it not on\r\ntheir tongues an influence equal to that which it exercises on their\r\nswiftly-flying feet, inspiring pretty prattle, sparkling repartee,\r\nenchanting smiles, and silvery laughter? Old Bertin du Rocheret was\r\nquite right when he invited his fair friends to continue drinking\r\n\r\n    'De ce nectar délicieux,\r\n    Qui pétille dans vos beaux yeux\r\n    Mieux qu'il ne brille dans mon verre.'\r\n\r\nSince these lines were penned, many thousands of bright eyes have so\r\nborrowed an additional lustre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt would certainly be going too far to suggest that flirtation and\r\nChampagne must have been introduced simultaneously, yet the former\r\ncan only have attained perfection since the advent of the latter.\r\nOnly consider what a failure a picnic or a garden-or water-party,\r\nor any other kind of entertainment to which that much-abused term\r\n_fête champêtre_ is applied, and where flirtation would be, without\r\nChampagne! As a matrimonial agent, Champagne's achievements outdo those\r\nof the cleverest of man[oe]uvring mammas. It was solely those two extra\r\nglasses at supper which emboldened young Impey Cue of the Foreign\r\nOffice to summon up sufficient courage to propose in the conservatory\r\nto Miss Yellowboy, the great heiress; and Impey Cue now lords it at\r\nYellowboy Park as though to the manor born. Nor must the part it plays\r\non the eventful day when the fatal knot is firmly tied be overlooked.\r\nIt has been cynically remarked that it is a painful spectacle even for\r\nthe most hardened to witness the consigning of a victim to the doom\r\nmatrimonial; and that it becomes all the more painful when, under the\r\nfutile pretext of festivity, bewildered fathers, harassed mothers,\r\nsorrowing sisters, envious cousins, bored connections, and pitying\r\nfriends, arrayed in their best attire, meet at an abnormally early hour\r\nround the miscalled social board. Still, fancy what a wedding breakfast\r\nwould be without the accompaniment of Champagne!\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE SOCIAL TREADMILL--THE WEDDING BREAKFAST\r\n\r\n(From a drawing by John Leech in 'Punch').]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COMING OF AGE (Drawn by R. Caldecott).]\r\n\r\nWith mamma in tears and papa in the fidgets, the bride half-way towards\r\nhysterics, and the bridegroom wishing from the bottom of his heart\r\nthat the crowded dining-room would suddenly transform itself into a\r\nsecurely-locked first-class coupé speeding onwards in the direction\r\nof Dover, the task of those speakers on whom devolves the duty of\r\ndescanting upon 'the happy occasion which has brought us together' is\r\nof a surety no easy one. And it would be still more uphill work were\r\nit not for the amount of cheerful inspiration fortunately to be drawn\r\nfrom the familiar foil-topped bottles. By and by, when the more serious\r\nspeeches have been duly stammered through, and the jovial bachelor--a\r\nmiddle-aged one by preference--rises to propose 'the health of the\r\nbridesmaids,' bursts of laughter from the men and responsive titters,\r\nbubbling up like the sparkling atoms in the wine which has inspired\r\nthem, from the lips of the damsels in question and their compeers,\r\nprove beyond question that Champagne has done its duty in dissipating\r\nthe gloom originally prevailing.\r\n\r\nA wedding, too, is the customary precursor of other family gatherings\r\nat which the vintage of the Marne plays the same enlivening part.\r\nThere are, for instance, christenings where godfathers bring as their\r\nofferings masterpieces of the silversmith's craft, and the infant's\r\nhealth is quaffed by turns in\r\n\r\n    'Sherry in silver, Hock in gold, and glassed Champagne;'\r\n\r\nfor the wine of mirth is out of place in metal, however precious, and\r\nneeds the purest crystal to exhibit all its finer qualities.

Between\r\nParis and Epernay, even, the banks of the Marne present a series of\r\nscenes of quiet beauty. The undulating ground is everywhere cultivated\r\nlike a garden. Handsome châteaux and charming country houses peep\r\nout from amid luxuriant foliage. Picturesque antiquated villages\r\nline the river's bank or climb the hill-sides, and after leaving La\r\nFerté-sous-Jouarre, the cradle of the Condés, all the more favoured\r\nsituations commence to be covered with vines.\r\n\r\nThis is especially the case in the vicinity of Château-Thierry--the\r\nbirthplace of La Fontaine--where the view is shut in on all sides by\r\nvine-clad slopes, which the spring frosts seldom spare. Hence merely\r\none good vintage out of four gladdens the hearts of the peasant\r\nproprietors, who find eager purchasers for their produce among the\r\nlower-class manufacturers of Champagne. In the same way the _petit vin\r\nde Chierry_, dexterously prepared and judiciously mingled with other\r\ngrowths, often figures as 'Fleur de Sillery' or 'Ay Mousseux.' In\r\nreality it is not until we have passed the ornate modern Gothic château\r\nof Boursault, erected in her declining years by the wealthy Veuve\r\nClicquot, by far the shrewdest manipulator of the sparkling products\r\nof Ay and Bouzy of her day, and the many towers and turrets of which,\r\nrising above umbrageous trees, crown the loftiest height within eyeshot\r\nof Epernay, that we find ourselves in that charmed circle of vineyards\r\nwhence Champagne--the wine, not merely of princes, as it has been\r\nsomewhat obsequiously termed, but essentially the _vin de société_--is\r\nderived.\r\n\r\nThe vinelands in the vicinity of Epernay, and consequently near the\r\nMarne, are commonly known as the 'Vineyards of the River,' whilst\r\nthose covering the slopes in the neighbourhood of Reims are termed the\r\n'Vineyards of the Mountain.' The Vineyards of the River comprise three\r\ndistinct divisions--first, those lining the right bank of the Marne\r\nand enjoying a southern and south-eastern aspect, among which are Ay,\r\nHautvillers, Cumières, Dizy, and Mareuil; secondly, the Côte d'Epernay\r\non the left bank of the river, of which Pierry, Moussy, and Vinay form\r\npart; and thirdly, the Côte d'Avize (the region _par excellence_ of\r\nwhite grapes), which stretches towards the south-east, and includes the\r\nvinelands of Cramant, Avize, Oger, Le Mesnil, and Vertus. The entire\r\nvineyard area is upwards of 40,000 acres.[378]\r\n\r\nThe Champagne vineyards most widely celebrated abroad are those of Ay\r\nand Sillery, although the last named are really the smallest in the\r\nChampagne district. Ay, distant only a few minutes by rail from Epernay,\r\nis in the immediate centre of the Vinelands of the River, having Mareuil\r\nand Avenay on the east, and Dizy, Hautvillers, and Cumières on the west;\r\nwhile Sillery lies at the foot of the so-called Mountain of Reims, and\r\nwithin an hour's drive of the old cathedral city.\r\n\r\nIt was on one of those occasional sunshiny days in the early part of\r\nOctober[379] when we first visited Ay--the vineyard of 'golden plants,'\r\nthe unique _premier cru_ of the Wines of the River--and the various\r\nadjacent vinelands. The road lay between two rows of closely-planted\r\npoplar-trees reaching almost to the village of Dizy, whose quaint gray\r\nchurch-tower, with its gabled roof, is dominated by the neighbouring\r\nvine-clad slopes, which extend from Avenay to Venteuil, some few\r\nmiles beyond Hautvillers, the cradle, so to speak, of the _vin\r\nmousseux_ of the Champagne. The vineyards of Dizy, the upper soil of\r\nwhich is largely mixed with loose stones, have chiefly a southern or\r\nwestern aspect, and, excepting in the case of the precipitous height\r\nsuggestively styled 'Grimpe Chat,' their incline is generally a gentle\r\none. In these vineyards, which rank among the _premiers crus_ of the\r\nChampagne, a quantity of wine from white grapes is regularly made.\r\n\r\nFrom Dizy the road runs immediately at the base of vine-clad slopes,\r\nbroken up occasionally by a conical peak detaching itself from the\r\nmass, and tinted from base to summit with richly-variegated hues,\r\namong which deep purple, yellow, green, gray, and crimson by turns\r\npredominate. On our right hand we pass a vineyard called Le Léon, which\r\ntradition asserts to be the one whence Pope Leo the Magnificent, the\r\npatron of Michael Angelo, Raffaelle, and Da Vinci, drew his supply of\r\nAy wine. The village of Ay lies immediately before us at the foot of\r\nthe slopes of vines, with the tapering spire of its ancient church\r\nrising above the neighbouring hills and cutting sharply against\r\nthe bright blue sky. The vineyards, which spread themselves over a\r\ncalcareous declivity, have mostly a full southern aspect, and the\r\npredominating vines are those known as golden plants, the fruit of\r\nwhich is of a deep purple colour. After these comes the _plant vert\r\ndoré_, and then a moderate proportion of the _plant gris_, white\r\nvarieties of grapes being no longer cultivated as formerly.[380]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DIZY AND ITS VINEYARD SLOPES.]\r\n\r\nThe Ay vineyards are mentioned in a charter of Edmund of Lancaster,\r\nson of our Henry II. and guardian of Jehanne, heiress of Henri le\r\nGros, Count of Champagne, dated 1276, and confirming the right of\r\nthe Abbey of Avenay to four hogsheads of wine from the _terroir_ of\r\nAy.[381] If faith, however, may be placed in monkish legends, their\r\nexistence dates back to the sixth century, at which epoch St. Tresain,\r\nthe patron saint of Avenay and a contemporary of St. Remi, emigrated\r\nto the Champagne from Scotland. Having given away all he possessed\r\nin charity, he became perforce a swineherd at Mutigny, a village on\r\nthe summit of the hill overlooking Ay, Mareuil, and Avenay. One day\r\nthe vine-growers of Ay, hearing that St. Remi was at Ville-en-Selve,\r\nsought him out, and clamorously accused St. Tresain of neglecting\r\nto look after his pigs, which had devastated the vineyards on the\r\nslopes, and so caused great loss to the community. When called upon\r\nfor his defence, St. Tresain acknowledged that he was wont to listen\r\nin the church-porch to the celebration of mass, and to forget on these\r\noccasions all such sublunary matters as swine. St. Remi, finding him so\r\ndeeply religious, not only forgave him his negligence and relieved him\r\nfrom his porcine charge for the future, but appointed him parish priest\r\nof Mareuil and Mutigny, the inhabitants of which, it is to be hoped,\r\nreceived more attention from him than his pigs had done. St. Tresain,\r\nalthough his promotion was brought about by the complaint of the men\r\nof Ay, retorted on the latter in a vindictive and unsaintly spirit,\r\nfor he ill-naturedly cursed them, and declared that after thirty years\r\nof age not one of them or their posterity should prosper temporally or\r\nspiritually--a prophecy which, if it affected the vine-growers of that\r\nepoch, has proved harmless enough in the case of their descendants.[382]\r\n\r\nAt Ay we visited the pressoir of the principal producer of _vin brut_,\r\nwho, although the owner of merely five hectares, or about twelve and\r\na half acres of vines, expected to make as many as 1500 pièces of\r\nwine that year, mainly of course from grapes purchased from other\r\ngrowers.[383] On our way from Ay to Mareuil, along the lengthy Rue\r\nde Châlons, we looked in at the little auberge at the corner of the\r\nBoulevard du Sud, and found a crowd of coopers and others connected in\r\nsome way with the vintage, taking their cheerful glasses round. The\r\nwalls of the room were appropriately enough decorated with capering\r\nbacchanals squeezing bunches of purple grapes and flourishing their\r\nthyrsi about in a very tipsy fashion. All the talk--and there was an\r\nabundance of it--had reference to the yield of this particular vintage\r\nand the high rate the Ay wine had realised. Eight hundred francs the\r\npièce of 200 litres, equal to 44 gallons, appeared to be the price\r\nfixed by the agents of the great Champagne houses, and at this figure\r\nthe bulk of the vintage was disposed of before a single grape passed\r\nthrough the winepress.[384]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe Mareuil vinelands, which include the vineyard bequeathed some\r\nsix hundred years ago by Canon John de Brie to the chapter of Reims\r\ncathedral, and possibly those vineyards bestowed in 1208 on the Abbey\r\nof Avenay by Alain de Jouvincourt, cover the slopes of two coteaux,\r\nthe first a continuation of the Côte d'Ay, and the second a detached\r\nspur, known as the Mont de Fourche, overlooking the Marne canal. Owing\r\nto the steepness of the slopes and to the roads through the vineyards\r\nbeing impracticable for carts, the grapes were being conveyed to the\r\npress-houses in baskets slung across the backs of mules and donkeys,\r\nmost of which, on account of their known partiality for the ripe\r\nfruit, were muzzled while thus employed. The wine yielded by the\r\nMareuil vineyards possesses body and vinosity, and while of course\r\nregarded as inferior to that of Ay, found a ready market the year of\r\nour visit at from five to six hundred francs the pièce. Prior to the\r\nFrench Revolution, the produce of the winepresses of the Seigneurs\r\nof Mareuil and the Abbess of Avenay were almost as renowned as the\r\nbest growths of Ay. The reputation of the wine was then shared by the\r\ninhabitants of the village; the popular local diction, 'Les gens d'Ay,\r\nles messieurs de Mareuil, et les crottés d'Avenay,' referring to the\r\ndays when the first was inhabited by enriched wine-growers, the second\r\nby people of some position, and the third merely by peasants, simply\r\nfrom its being cut off, in a great measure, from outside intercourse\r\nthrough the badness of its approaches. It was not until after 1776,\r\nwhen the _seigneurie_ of Louvois was purchased from the Marquis de\r\nSouvré by Madame Adelaïde, aunt of Louis XVI., that the road from\r\nEpernay to Louvois, which passes through Mareuil and Avenay, was,\r\nif not constructed, at any rate rendered practicable, in order to\r\nfacilitate the visits of the princess to her new acquisition. These\r\nroads exist, though no traces remain of the ancient fort of Mareuil on\r\nthe bank of the Marne, taken from the English in 1359 by Gaucher de\r\nChatillon, captain of Reims, and alternately occupied by Leaguers and\r\nRoyalists during the War of Religion in the sixteenth century. Nor does\r\nthere seem any chance of identifying either the 'vineyard called la\r\nGibaudelle, lying next the vineyard of Oudet, surnamed Leclerc,' in the\r\nterritory of Mareuil, which Guillaume de Lafors and Marguerite his wife\r\nbestowed upon the Abbey of Avenay in 1273, or those from which, in the\r\nfourteenth century, Archbishop Richard Pique of Reims used to draw ten\r\nmuids or hogsheads of wine annually for 'droits de vinage.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: AVENAY AS SEEN FROM THE RAILWAY.]\r\n\r\nThe vineyards of Avenay also date prior to the thirteenth century,\r\nmention being frequently made of them in the charters of that\r\nepoch.[385] Their best wine, which Saint Evremond extolled so highly,\r\nis vintaged to-day up the slopes of Mont Hurlé. Avenay itself is a\r\ntumbledown little village situated in the direction of Reims, and\r\nthe year of our visit we found the yield from its vineyards had been\r\nscarcely more than the third of an average one, and that the wine\r\nproduced at the first pressure of the grapes had been sold for 500\r\nfrancs the pièce. We tasted there some very fair still red wine, made\r\nfrom the same grapes as Champagne, remarkably deep in colour, full\r\nof body, and possessing that slight sweet bitterish flavour which\r\ncharacterises certain of the better-class growths of the South of\r\nFrance.\r\n\r\nAlthough at Avenay vineyards cover the slopes as of yore, when\r\nMarmontel used to wander amongst them in company with his inamorata\r\nMademoiselle Hévin de Navarre, no traces remain of the ancient royal\r\nabbey--founded by St. Bertha in 660, on the martyrdom of her husband,\r\nSt. Gombert, one of the early Christian missionaries to Scotland--where\r\nCharles V. took up his quarters when invading Champagne in 1544, and\r\nwhere the deputies of the Leaguers of Reims and of the Royalists of\r\nChâlons met in October 1592 to settle the terms of the 'Traité des\r\nVendanges,' securing to both parties liberty to gather in the vintage\r\nunmolested.[386] The villagers still point out the house where Henri\r\nQuatre slept, and the window from which he harangued the populace\r\nduring the visit paid by him to Madame Françoise de la Marck, the\r\nAbbess of Avenay,[387] in August of the same year. This, by the\r\nway, does not seem to have been the only occasion when the spot was\r\nhonoured by the presence of Royalty; for a tradition, which, although\r\nunsupported by any documentary evidence, appears to be worthy of\r\ncredence, is current to the effect that Marie Antoinette paid a visit\r\nto the Abbey of Avenay during her sojourn at Louvois as the guest of\r\nMadame Adelaïde in 1786. The spring which, according to the legend,\r\ngushed forth when St. Bertha, in imitation of Moses, struck the rock\r\nwith her distaff, is still shown to travellers; and scandal has gone\r\nso far as to say that recourse is sometimes had to it to eke out the\r\nnative vintage.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Avenay we ascended the hills to Mutigny, and wound\r\nround thence to Cumières, on the banks of the Marne, finding the\r\nvintage in full operation all throughout the route. The vineyards\r\nof Cumières--classed as a second cru--yield a wine which, though\r\ncelebrated in the verses of Eustache Deschamps, a famous and prolific\r\nChampenois poet of the fourteenth century, varies to-day considerably\r\nin quality, the best coming from the 'Côtes-à-bras,' the property of\r\nthe Abbey of Hautvillers in Dom Perignon's day. The Cumières vineyards\r\njoin those of Hautvillers on the one side and Damery on the other, the\r\nlatter a cosy little river-side village, where the _bon Roi Henri_\r\nsought relaxation from the turmoils of war in the society of the fair\r\nAnne du Pay, _sa belle hôtesse_, as the gallant Béarnais was wont\r\nto style her. Damery also claims to be the birthplace of Adrienne\r\nLecouvreur, the celebrated actress of the Regency, and mistress of the\r\nMaréchal de Saxe, who coaxed her out of her 30,000_l._ of savings to\r\nenable him to prosecute his suit with the obese Anna Iwanowna, niece of\r\nPeter the Great, which, had he only been successful, would have secured\r\nthe future hero of Fontenoy the coveted dukedom of Courland. From\r\nCumières can be distinguished far away on the horizon the ruined tower\r\nof the _bourg_ of Châtillon, the birthplace of Pope Urban II., preacher\r\nof the first Crusade, and a devotee of the wine of Ay.[388]\r\n\r\nIt was during the budding spring-time when we made our formal\r\npilgrimage to Hautvillers across the swollen waters of the Marne at\r\nEpernay. Our way lay for a time along a straight level poplar-bordered\r\nroad, with verdant meadows on either hand; then diverged sharply to\r\nthe left, and we commenced ascending the vine-clad hills, on a narrow\r\nplateau of which the church and abbey remains are picturesquely\r\nperched. The closely-planted vines extend along the undulating slopes\r\nto the summit of the plateau, and wooded heights rise up beyond,\r\naffording shelter from the bleak winds that sweep over here from the\r\nnorth. Spite of the reputation which the wine of Hautvillers enjoyed a\r\ncouple of centuries ago, and its association with the origin of _vin\r\nmousseux_, the vineyards to-day appear to have been relegated to the\r\nrank of a second cru, their produce ordinarily commanding less than\r\ntwo-thirds of the price obtained for the Ay and Verzenay growths.[389]\r\n\r\nThe church of Hautvillers and the remains of the abbey are situated\r\nat the farther extremity of the village, at the end of its one long\r\nstreet, named, pertinently enough, the Rue de Bacchus. Time, the\r\niconoclasts of the great Revolution, and the quieter, yet far more\r\ndestructive, labours of the Bande Noire, have spared but little of the\r\nroyal abbey of St. Peter, where Dom Perignon lighted upon his happy\r\ndiscovery of the effervescent quality of Champagne. The quaint old\r\nchurch, scraps of which date back to the twelfth century, the remnants\r\nof the cloisters, and one of the abbey's ancient gateways, are all that\r\nremain to testify to the grandeur of its past, when it was the proud\r\nboast of the brotherhood that it had given nine archbishops to the see\r\nof Reims, and two-and-twenty abbots to various celebrated monasteries.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FOUNTAIN AT A CAFÉ IN THE RUE DE BACCHUS, HAUTVILLERS.]\r\n\r\nPassing through an unpretentious gateway, we find ourselves in a\r\nspacious courtyard, bounded by buildings somewhat complex in character.\r\nOn our right rises the tower of the church with the remains of the\r\nold cloisters, now walled-in and lighted by small square windows, and\r\npropped up by heavy buttresses. To the left stands the residence of the\r\nbailiff, and beyond it an eighteenth-century château on the site of\r\nthe abbot's house. Formerly the abbey precincts were bounded on this\r\nside by a picturesque gateway-tower leading to the vineyards, and known\r\nas the 'Porte des Pressoirs,' from its contiguity to the winepresses.\r\nThe court is enclosed on its remaining sides by huge barn-like\r\nbuildings, stables, and cart-sheds; while roaming about are numerous\r\nlive stock, indicating that what remains of the once-famous royal\r\nabbey of St. Peter has degenerated into an ordinary farm. To-day the\r\nabbey buildings and certain of its lands are the property of M. Paul\r\nChandon de Brialles, of the firm of Moët & Chandon, the great Champagne\r\nmanufacturers of Epernay, who maintains them as a farm, keeping some\r\nsix-and-thirty cows there, with the object of securing the necessary\r\nmanure for the numerous vineyards which the firm own hereabouts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PORTE DES PRESSOIRS, ABBEY OF HAUTVILLERS\r\n\r\n(Destroyed by fire in 1879).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMAINS OF CLOISTERS, ABBEY OF HAUTVILLERS.]\r\n\r\nThe dilapidated cloisters, littered with old casks, farm implements,\r\nand the like, preserve ample traces of their former architectural\r\ncharacter, changed as they are since the days when the sandalled feet\r\nof the worthy cellarer resounded through the echoing arches as he paced\r\nto and fro, meditating upon coming vintages and future marryings of\r\nwines. Vine-leaves and bunches of grapes decorate some of the more\r\nancient columns inside the church, and grotesque mediæval monsters,\r\nsuch as monkish architects habitually delighted in, entwine themselves\r\naround the capitals of others. The stalls of the choir are elaborately\r\ncarved with cherubs' heads, medallions and figures of saints, cupids\r\nsupporting shields, and free and graceful arabesques of the epoch of\r\nthe Renaissance. In the chancel, close by the altar-steps, are a couple\r\nof black-marble slabs, with Latin inscriptions of dubious orthography,\r\nthe one to Johannes Royer, who died in 1527, and the other, which has\r\nbeen already cited in detail, setting forth the virtues and merits of\r\nDom Petrus Perignon, the discoverer of the effervescing qualities of\r\nChampagne. In the central aisle a similar slab marks the resting-place\r\nof Dom Thedoricus Ruynart--obit 1709--an ancestor of the Reims\r\nRuinarts; and little square stones interspersed among the tiles with\r\nwhich the side aisles of the church are paved record the deaths of\r\nother members of the Benedictine brotherhood during the seventeenth\r\nand eighteenth centuries. Several large pictures grace the walls of\r\nthe church, the most interesting one representing St. Nivard, Bishop\r\nof Reims, and his friend, St. Berchier, designating to some mediæval\r\narchitect the site which the contemplated Abbey of St. Peter is to\r\noccupy, as set forth in the legend already related.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE ABBEY CHURCH, HAUTVILLERS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FROM THE ABBEY CHURCH, HAUTVILLERS.]\r\n\r\nAt a short distance from the abbey farm, Messrs. Moët & Chandon have\r\nerected a tower, whence a splendid view, extending over the vineyards\r\nof Cumières, Hautvillers, Dizy, and Ay, with those lying on the\r\nopposite bank of the river, is to be obtained. Gazing from here, it is\r\neasy to imagine the scene presented in the days when the Abbey of St.\r\nPeter still reared its stately walls, when Louis Chaumejan de Tourille\r\nwore the abbatial insignia, and Dom Perignon displayed with equal\r\npride as the badge of his office the key of the abbey cellars. Over\r\nthese slopes on a dewy autumn morning the latter's eyes, ere sealed\r\nin blindness, must have often wandered, and an unctuous chuckle must\r\nhave welled up from between his lips as he marked the grapes steadily\r\nadvancing towards maturity. We can fancy him pausing from time to time\r\n\r\n    'To breathe an ejaculatory prayer\r\n    And a benediction on the vines,'\r\n\r\nalthough in those halcyon days there was neither oïdium nor phylloxera\r\nto be dreaded, and an extra taper or so to St. Vincent, the patron of\r\nvine-dressers, sufficed to secure the crop from ordinary accidents of\r\nflood and field.\r\n\r\nWhen the epoch of the vintage arrived, and the slopes were all alive\r\nwith bands of vintagers engaged in stripping the ripened purple bunches\r\nfrom the vines, and carefully transporting them to the winepress,\r\none can picture Dom Perignon smiling contentedly at the report of\r\nthe gray-haired bailiff that no such crop had been garnered for\r\nyears before. And when the must began to gush forth as the stalwart\r\nbare-armed peasants tugged at the levers of the huge press on which M.\r\nde Tourille had placed the glorifying inscription elsewhere cited, with\r\nwhat satisfaction must Perignon have recognised a foreshadowing of that\r\ndivine aroma which lends so exquisite a charm to the choice vintages of\r\nthe Champagne! Later on we can imagine him entering the abbey cellar,\r\nstored with the results of his careful labours, as a\r\n\r\n                              'sacred place,\r\n    With a thoughtful, solemn, and reverent pace,'\r\n\r\nand softly chanting to himself, as he draws off a flagon of the best\r\nand choicest vintage which the gloomy vaults contain:\r\n\r\n    'Ah, how the streamlet laughs and sings!\r\n    What a delicious fragrance springs\r\n    From the deep flagon as it fills,\r\n    As of hyacinths and daffodils!'\r\n\r\nThe vineyards of the Côte d'Epernay, on the southern bank of the\r\nMarne, extend eastward from beyond Boursault, on whose wooded height\r\nstands the fine château built by Madame Clicquot, and in which her\r\ngranddaughter, the Comtesse de Mortemart, to-day resides. They then\r\nfollow the course of the river, and, after winding round behind\r\nEpernay, diverge towards the south-west. Amongst them are the slopes\r\nof Pierry, Mardeuil, Moussy, Vinay, Ablois, and Chouilly, the last\r\nnamed situate somewhat apart from the rest to the east of Epernay,\r\nand yielding a light wine, qualified as slightly purgative. The vines\r\nof the Côte d'Epernay produce only black grapes, and many of the\r\nvineyards are of great antiquity, the one known as the Closet, near\r\nEpernay, having been bequeathed under that name by a canon of Laon\r\nnamed Parchasius to the neighbouring Abbey of St. Martin six and a half\r\ncenturies ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VILLAGE OF PIERRY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINEYARD WINE-CELLARS AT PIERRY.]\r\n\r\nA short drive along the high-road leading from Epernay to Orleans\r\nbrings us to the village of Pierry, cosily nestling amongst groves of\r\npoplars in the valley of the Cubry, with some half-score of châteaux\r\nof the last century, belonging to well-to-do wine-growers of the\r\nneighbourhood, screened from the road by umbrageous gardens. Vines\r\nmount the slopes that rise around, the higher summits being crowned\r\nwith forest, while here and there some pleasant village shelters\r\nitself under the brow of a lofty hill. Near Pierry many cellars have\r\nbeen excavated in the chalky soil, to the flints so prevalent in which\r\nthe village is said to owe its name. The entrances to these cellars\r\nare closed by iron gateways, and on the skirts of the vineyards we\r\ncome upon whole rows of them picturesquely overgrown with ivy, and\r\nsuggestive in appearance of catacombs. Early in the last century the\r\nwine vintaged here in the Clos St. Pierre, belonging to an abbey of\r\nthis name at Châlons, acquired a high reputation through the care\r\nbestowed upon it by Brother Jean Oudart, whose renown almost rivalled\r\nthat of Dom Perignon himself; and to-day the Pierry vineyards,\r\nproducing exclusively black grapes, hold a high rank among the\r\nsecond-class crus of the Marne.[390]\r\n\r\nCrossing the Sourdon, a little stream which, after bubbling up in the\r\nmidst of huge rocks in the forest of Epernay, rushes down the hills,\r\nand then changes its name to the Cubry, we soon reach Moussy, where\r\nvineyards have been in existence for something like eight centuries;\r\nfor we find enumerated in the list of bequests made to the hospital of\r\nSt. Mary at Reims in the eleventh and twelfth centuries sundry 'vineas\r\nin Moiseio' devised by such long-forgotten notabilities as Pontius,\r\npriest and canon, Tebaldus Papilenticus, Johannes de Germania, and\r\nMacela, wife of Pepinus. Spite, however, of their long pedigree and\r\nadvantageous southern aspect, the Moussy vineyards rank to-day merely\r\nas a second cru. Continuing to skirt the vine-clad slopes we come to\r\nVinay, noted for an ancient grotto[391]--the former comfortless abode\r\nof some rheumatic anchorite--and a pretended miraculous spring to\r\nwhich fever-stricken pilgrims to-day credulously resort. The water may\r\npossibly merit its renown; but the wine here produced is very inferior,\r\ndue no doubt to the class of vines, the meunier being the leading\r\nvariety cultivated. At Ablois St. Martin, once a fief of Mary Queen\r\nof Scots, and picturesquely perched partway up a slope in the midst\r\nof hills covered with vines and crowned with forest trees, the Côte\r\nd'Epernay ends, and the produce becomes of a choicer character.\r\n\r\nAs the Côte d'Avize lies to the south-east, to reach it we have to\r\nretrace our steps to Pierry, and follow the road which there branches\r\noff, leaving on our right hand the vineyards of Chavot, Monthelon, and\r\nGrauves, now of no particular note, although of undoubted antiquity,\r\nBlanche of Castille, Countess of Champagne, having endowed the Abbey of\r\nArgensolles, on its foundation in 1224, with sundry strips of vineland,\r\nincluding one at Grauves, possibly the vineyard of Les Roualles,\r\nwhich yields a wine not unlike certain growths of the Mountain of\r\nReims. After passing through Cuis, where the slopes, planted with\r\nboth black and white varieties of vines, are extremely abrupt, and\r\nwhere Simon la Bole, man-at-arms of Epernay, and his wife Basile\r\ngave, in 1210, 'four hogsheads of _vinage_ to be taken annually' to\r\nHugo, Abbot of St. Martin at Epernay, we eventually reach Cramant,\r\none of the grand _premiers crus_ of the Champagne. From the vineyards\r\naround this picturesque little village, and extending along the\r\nsomewhat precipitous Côte de Saran--a prominent object, on which is M.\r\nMoët's handsome château--there is vintaged a wine from white grapes,\r\nespecially remarkable for lightness and delicacy and the richness\r\nof its bouquet, and an admixture of which is essential to every\r\nfirst-class Champagne _cuvée_.\r\n\r\nFrom Cramant the road runs direct to Avize, a large thriving village,\r\nlying at the foot of vineyard slopes, where numerous Champagne firms\r\nhave established themselves. Its prosperity dates from the commencement\r\nof the last century (1715), when the Count de Lhery, its feudal lord,\r\ncleared away the remains of its ancient ramparts, filled up the\r\nmoat, and planted the ground with vines, the produce of which proved\r\nadmirably suited for the sparkling wines then coming into vogue.\r\nPrior to this the Avize wine, made almost entirely from white grapes,\r\nfetched only from 25 to 30 francs the queue; but being found well\r\nadapted for the manufacture of the strongly-effervescent wine known\r\nas _saute-bouchon_, it soon commanded as much as 300 francs, and the\r\narpent of vineyard rose in value from 250 to 2000 francs.[392] To-day\r\nthe light delicate wine of Avize is classed, like that of Cramant, as\r\na _premier cru_, and it is the same with the wine of Oger,[393] lying\r\na little to the south, while the neighbouring growths of Le Mesnil\r\nhold a slightly inferior rank. The latter village and its gray Gothic\r\nchurch lie under the hill in the midst of vines that almost climb the\r\nforest-crowned summit. The stony soil hereabouts is said to be better\r\nadapted to the cultivation of white than of black grapes; besides\r\nwhich, the wines of Le Mesnil are remarkable for their effervescent\r\nproperties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LE MESNIL AND ITS VINEYARDS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VIEW OF VERTUS.]\r\n\r\nVertus forms the southern limit of the Côte d'Avize, and the vineyard\r\nslopes subsiding at their base into a broad expanse of fertile\r\nfields, and crested as usual with dense forest, rise up behind the\r\npicturesque old town, which is mentioned in a letter of the Emperor\r\nLouis and a charter of Charles the Bald in the ninth century. It was\r\nonce strongly fortified, though a dilapidated gateway is all that\r\nto-day remains of the ancient ramparts, which failed to secure it in\r\n1380, when the English, under the 'Comte de Bouquingouan,' presumably\r\nBuckingham, burnt the whole of the town except the Abbey of St.\r\nMartin, and elicited from the native poet, Eustache Deschamps, _dit_\r\nMorel, 'huissier d'armes' to Charles VI. and castellan of Fismes, a\r\nlamentation, wherein he fails not to mention the high renown of the\r\nlocal vintage.[394]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD HOUSES AT VERTUS.]\r\n\r\nVertus can still boast a curious old church of the eleventh century,\r\nwith solid Romanesque towers, elaborate mouldings, and richly\r\nornamented capitals; also a picturesque promenade, shaded with\r\ncentenarian trees, together with several quaint old houses, including\r\none with a florid Gothic window surrounded by a border of grapes and\r\nvine-leaves, and another with a quaintly projecting corner turret,\r\ndominated by a conical roof. The Vertus vineyards are mentioned in a\r\ncharter of the Abbey of Ste. Marie, dated 1151. They were originally\r\nplanted with vines from Beaune in Burgundy, and in the fourteenth\r\ncentury yielded a red wine held in high repute, of pleasant flavour,\r\nand rich in perfume,[395] but which would appear to have been imbued\r\nwith those purgative properties[396] traceable in other growths of the\r\nChampagne. The red wine of Vertus formed the favourite beverage of\r\nWilliam III. of England, and was long in high repute. To-day, however,\r\nthe growers find it more profitable to make white instead of red wine\r\nfrom their crops of black grapes, the former commanding a good price\r\nfor conversion into _vin mousseux_, from being in the opinion of some\r\nmanufacturers especially valuable for binding a _cuvée_ together. The\r\nVertus growths rank among the second-class Champagne crus.[397]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: SILLERY AND ITS VINEYARDS.]\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n       /The Champagne Vinelands--The Vineyards of the Mountain./\r\n\r\n    The wine of Sillery--Origin of its renown--The Maréchale\r\n    d'Estrées a successful Marchande de Vin--The Marquis de Sillery\r\n    the greatest wine-farmer in the Champagne--Cossack appreciation\r\n    of the Sillery produce--The route from Reims to Sillery--Henri\r\n    Quatre and the Taissy wines--Failure of the Jacquesson\r\n    system of vine cultivation--Château of Sillery--Wine-making\r\n    at M.

The\r\nvinelands of Bouzy and Ambonnay are also reckoned within it, though\r\nsituate somewhat apart on a southern slope of the Mountain some few\r\nmiles from the Marne.\r\n\r\nThe smallest of the Champagne vineyards are those of Sillery, and yet\r\nno wine of the Marne enjoys a greater renown, due originally to the\r\nintelligence and energy of the family of the Brularts, Marquises of\r\nSillery and Puisieux, to whom the estate originally belonged, and who\r\nseem to have devoted great attention to viticulture from certainly the\r\nmiddle of the seventeenth century. The reputation of the still wine of\r\nSillery, 'the highest manifestation of the divinity of Bacchus in all\r\nFrance,' was firmly established at this epoch. 'As to M. de Puyzieux,'\r\nwrites St. Evremond to his friend Lord Galloway in August 1701, 'he\r\nacts wisely to fall in with the bad taste now in fashion concerning\r\nChampagne in order to sell his own the better;' but at the same time\r\nhe counsels his correspondent to get the marquis to make him 'a little\r\nbarrel after the fashion in which it was made forty years before, prior\r\nto the existing depravation of taste.'[398] The marquis here referred\r\nto was Roger Brulart, Governor of Epernay, who was himself a joyous\r\n_bon vivant_, and died from over-indulgence in the good things provided\r\nat a dinner given by the Chartreux in 1719.[399] He was succeeded by\r\nhis nephew, Louis Philogène Brulart, Marquis de Sillery et de Puisieux,\r\nto whom, in 1727, on the occasion of his marriage with Mademoiselle de\r\nSouvré, granddaughter of Louvois, the Sieurs Quatresous and Chertemps\r\npresented at his château of Sillery, on behalf of the town of Epernay,\r\na basket of one hundred flasks of wine.[400] He died in 1771, leaving\r\nan only daughter, Adelaïde Félicité Brulart de Sillery, married, in\r\n1744, to Louis César le Tellier, Maréchal Duc d'Estrées.\r\n\r\nThe wine attained its apogee under the fostering care of the Maréchale\r\nd'Estrées, to whom not only this cru, but those of Mailly, Verzy, and\r\nVerzenay belonged, and who concentrated their joint produce in the\r\ncapacious cellars of her château, afterwards sending it forth with her\r\nown guarantee, under the general name of Sillery, which, like Aaron's\r\nserpent, thus swallowed up the others. The Maréchale's social position\r\nenabled her to secure for her wines the recognition they really\r\nmerited, being made with the utmost care and a rare intelligence, shown\r\nby the removal of every unripe, rotten, or imperfect grape from the\r\nbunches before pressing, so that the _Vin de la Maréchale_, as it was\r\nstyled, became famous throughout Europe.[401] This lady is not to be\r\nconfounded with that other Maréchale d'Estrées mentioned by St. Simon,\r\nnoted for her exquisite and magnificent although rare entertainments,\r\nand so sordid that when her daughter, who was covered with jewels, fell\r\ndown at a ball, her first cry was, not like Shylock's, 'My daughter!'\r\nbut 'My diamonds!' as, rushing forward, she strove to pick up, not the\r\nfallen dancer, but her scattered gems.\r\n\r\nLater owners of the famous Sillery cru did their best to sustain its\r\nreputation, and Arthur Young, who stopped here in 1787, speaks of the\r\nMarquis de Sillery as 'the greatest wine-farmer in the Champagne,'\r\nhaving on his own hands 180 arpents of vines, and cellar-room for a\r\ncouple of hundred pièces of wine.[402] Among more recent appreciation\r\nof the merits of Sillery sec may be mentioned the Cossacks, who\r\npillaged the district in 1814, and who, not being able to carry off all\r\nthe wine from the cellar of the Count de Valence at Sillery, stove in\r\nsome thirty pièces of the best, and set the place afloat.[403]\r\n\r\nThe drive from Reims to Sillery has nothing attractive about it. A\r\nlong, straight, level road bordered by trees intersects a broad tract\r\nof open country, skirted on the right by the Petite Montagne of Reims,\r\nwith antiquated villages nestled among the dense woodland. After\r\ncrossing the Châlons line of railway--near where one of the new forts\r\nconstructed for the defence of Reims rises up behind the villages and\r\nvineyards of Cernay and Nogent l'Abbesse--the country becomes more\r\nundulating. Poplars border the broad Marne canal, and a low fringe of\r\nfoliage marks the course of the languid river Vesle, on the banks of\r\nwhich is Taissy, famous in the old days for its wines, great favourites\r\nwith Sully, and which almost lured Henri Quatre from his allegiance to\r\nthe vintages of Ay and Arbois that he loved so well.[404]\r\n\r\nTo the left rises Mont de la Pompelle, where the first Christians of\r\nReims suffered martyrdom, and where, in 1658, the Spaniards under\r\nMontal, when attempting to ravage the vineyards of the district,\r\nwere repulsed with terrible slaughter by the Rémois militia, led on\r\nby Grandpré. A quarter of a century ago the low ground on our right\r\nnear Sillery was planted with vines by the late M. Jacquesson, the\r\nthen owner of the Sillery estate, and a large Champagne manufacturer\r\nat Châlons, who was anxious to resuscitate the ancient reputation\r\nof the domain. Under the advice of Dr. Guyot, the well-known writer\r\non viticulture, he planted the vines in deep trenches, which led to\r\nthe vineyards being punningly termed Jacquesson's _celery_ beds. To\r\nshield the vines from hailstorms prevalent in the district, and the\r\nmore dangerous spring frosts, so fatal to vines planted in low-lying\r\nsituations, long rolls of straw-matting were stored close at hand with\r\nwhich to roof them over when needful. These precautions were scarcely\r\nneeded, however; the vines languished through moisture at the roots,\r\nand eventually were mostly rooted up.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRI QUATRE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHÂTEAU DE SILLERY.]\r\n\r\nAfter again crossing the railway we pass the trim restored turrets\r\nof the famous château of Sillery, with its gateways, moats, and\r\ndrawbridges, flanked by trees and floral _parterres_. It was here that\r\nthe stout squire Laurent Pichiet kept watch and ward over the 'forte\r\nmaison de Sillery' on behalf of the Archbishop of Reims at the close\r\nof the fourteenth century, that the Maréchale d'Estrées carried on her\r\nsuccessful business as a _marchande de vins_, and that the pragmatic\r\nand pedantic Comtesse de Genlis, governess of the Orleans princes,\r\nspent, as she tells us, the happiest days of her life. The few thriving\r\nvineyards of Sillery cover a gentle eminence which rises out of the\r\nplain, and present on the one side an eastern and on the other a\r\nwestern aspect. They have fallen somewhat from their high estate since\r\nthe days when old Coffin of Beauvais University sang their praises in\r\nLatin:\r\n\r\n    'Let Horace the charms of old Massica own,\r\n        And the praise of Falernian sound;\r\n    Such wines, although famous, must bow to that grown\r\n        On Sillery's fortunate ground.'[405]\r\n\r\nTo-day the Vicomte de Brimont and M. Fortel of Reims, the latter\r\nof whom cultivates some forty acres of vines, yielding ordinarily\r\nabout 300 hogsheads, are the only wine-growers at Sillery. Before\r\npressing his grapes--of course for sparkling wine--M. Fortel has them\r\nthrown into a trough, at the bottom of which are a couple of grooved\r\ncylinders, each about eight inches in diameter, and revolving in\r\ncontrary directions, the effect of which, when set in motion, is to\r\ndisengage the grapes partially from their stalks. Grapes and stalks are\r\nthen placed under the press, which is on the old cider-press principle,\r\nand the must runs into a reservoir beneath, whence it is pumped into\r\nlarge vats, each holding from 250 to 500 gallons. Here it remains\r\nfrom six to eight hours, and is then run off into casks, the spigots\r\nof which are merely laid lightly over the holes, and in the course of\r\ntwelve days the wine begins to ferment. It now rests until the end of\r\nthe year, when it is drawn off into new casks and delivered to the\r\nbuyer, invariably one or other of the great Champagne houses, who\r\nwillingly pay an exceptionally high price for it. The second and third\r\npressures of the grapes yield an inferior wine, and from the husks and\r\nstalks _eau-de-vie_, worth about five shillings a gallon, is distilled.\r\n\r\nThe wine known as Sillery sec is a full, dry, pleasant-flavoured,\r\nand somewhat spirituous amber-coloured wine. Very little of it is\r\nmade nowadays, and most that is comes from the adjacent vineyards of\r\nVerzenay and Mailly, and is principally reserved by the growers for\r\ntheir own consumption. One of these candidly admitted that the old\r\nreputation of the wine had exploded, and that better white Bordeaux\r\nand Burgundy wines were to be obtained for less money. In making dry\r\nSillery, which locally is esteemed as a valuable tonic, it is essential\r\nthat the grapes should be subjected to only slight pressure; while to\r\nhave it in perfection it is equally essential that the wine should be\r\nkept for ten years in the wood according to some, and eight years in\r\nbottle according to others, to which circumstance its high price is in\r\nall probability to be attributed. In course of time it forms a deposit,\r\nand has the disadvantage common to all the finer still wines of the\r\nChampagne district of not travelling well.\r\n\r\nBeyond Sillery the vineyards of Verzenay unfold themselves, spreading\r\nover the extensive slopes and stretching to the summit of the steep\r\nheight to the right, where a windmill or two are perched. Everywhere\r\nthe vintagers are busy detaching the grapes with their little\r\nhook-shaped _serpettes_, the women all wearing projecting close-fitting\r\nbonnets, as though needlessly careful of their anything but blonde\r\ncomplexions. Long carts laden with baskets of grapes block the narrow\r\nroads, and donkeys, duly muzzled, with panniers slung across their\r\nbacks, toil up and down the steeper slopes. Half-way up the principal\r\nhill, backed by a dense wood and furrowed with deep trenches, whence\r\nsoil has been removed for manuring the vineyards, is the village of\r\nVerzenay--where in the Middle Ages the Archbishop of Reims had a\r\nfief--overlooking a veritable sea of vines. Rising up in front of the\r\nold gray cottages, encompassed by orchards or gardens, are the white\r\nwalls and long red roofs of the vendangeoirs belonging to the great\r\nChampagne houses--Moët & Chandon, Clicquot, G. H. Mumm, Roederer, Deutz\r\n& Geldermann, and others--all teeming with bustle and excitement, and\r\nwith the vines almost reaching to their very doors. Messrs. Moët &\r\nChandon have as many as eight presses in full work, and own no less\r\nthan 120 acres of vines on the neighbouring slopes, besides the Clos de\r\nRomont--in the direction of Sillery, and yielding a wine of the Sillery\r\ntype--belonging to M. Raoul Chandon. Verzenay ranks as a _premier cru_,\r\nand for three years in succession--1872, 3, and 4--its wines fetched a\r\nhigher price than either those of Ay or Bouzy. In 1873 the _vin brut_\r\ncommanded the exceptionally large sum of 1050 francs the hogshead of\r\n44 gallons. All the inhabitants of Verzenay are vine-proprietors, and\r\nseveral million francs are annually received by them for the produce\r\nof their vineyards from the manufacturers of Champagne. The wine of\r\nVerzenay, remarkable for its body and vinosity, has always been held\r\nin high repute,[406] which is apparently more than can be said of the\r\nprobity of the inhabitants, for, according to an old Champagne saying,\r\n'Whenever at Verzenay \"Stop thief\" is cried every one takes to his\r\nheels.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VINEYARDS OF VERZENAY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DEVICE ABOVE ENTRANCE TO VENDANGEOIR AT VERZENAY.]\r\n\r\nJust over the Mountain of Reims is the village of Verzy, the\r\nvine-growers of which distinguished themselves in the fifteenth century\r\nby their resistance to the officials sent to levy the 'aide en gros'\r\nof two sols per queue, imposed by Louis XI. on all wine made within a\r\nradius of four miles of Reims. The Verzy vineyards--ranked to-day as a\r\nsecond cru--date at least from the days of the Knights Templars, when\r\nthe Commanderie of Reims had 'two vineyards near the abbey' here. They\r\nadjoin those of Verzenay, and are almost exclusively planted with white\r\ngrapes, the only instance of the kind to be met with in the district.\r\nIn the Clos St. Basse, however--taking its name from the Abbey of St.\r\nBasle, of which the village was a dependency, and where Edward III. of\r\nEngland had his head-quarters during the siege of Reims--black grapes\r\nalone are grown, and its produce is almost on a par with the wines of\r\nVerzenay.\r\n\r\nImmediately prior to the Revolution, one-fourth of the inhabitants of\r\nVerzy were landholders, each cultivating about five arpents of vines,\r\nand obtaining therefrom, on an average, twenty poinçons, out of which\r\nthe abbey exacted one and three-quarters for 'droits de dimes et de\r\nbanalité de pressoir.' Southwards of Verzy are the third-class crus of\r\nVillers-Marmery and Trépail, the former of which was of some repute in\r\nthe Middle Ages.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PORTION OF FRIEZE OF OLD HOUSE, RUE DU BARBATRE, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nWe made several excursions to the vineyards of Bouzy, driving out of\r\nReims along the ancient Rue du Barbâtre and past the quaint old church\r\nof St. Remi, one of the sights of the Champagne capital, and notable,\r\namong other things, for its magnificent ancient stained-glass windows,\r\nand the handsome modern tomb of the popular Rémois saint. It was here\r\nin the Middle Ages that that piece of priestly mummery, the procession\r\nof the herrings, used to take place at dusk on the Wednesday before\r\nEaster. Preceded by a cross, the canons of the church marched in double\r\nfile up the aisles, each trailing a cord after him, with a herring\r\nattached. Every one's object was to tread on the herring in front of\r\nhim, and prevent his own herring from being trodden upon by the canon\r\nwho followed behind--a difficult enough proceeding, which, if it did\r\nnot edify, certainly afforded much amusement to the lookers-on.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT WELL, RUE DU BARBATRE, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nAfter crossing the canal and the river Vesle, and leaving the gray\r\nantiquated-looking village of Cormontreuil on our left, we traversed a\r\nwide stretch of cultivated country streaked with patches of woodland,\r\nwith occasional windmills dotting the distant heights, and villages\r\nnestling among the trees up the mountain-sides and in the quiet\r\nhollows. Soon a few vineyards occupying the lower slopes, and thronged\r\nby bands of vintagers, came in sight, and the country too grew more\r\npicturesque. We passed successively on our right hand Rilly, a former\r\nfief of the Archbishop of Reims, and noted for its capital red wine;\r\nthen Chigny, where the Abbot of St. Remi had a vineyard as early as\r\nthe commencement of the thirteenth century; and afterwards Ludes,--all\r\nthree of them situated more or less up the mountain, with vines in\r\nevery direction, relieved by a dark background of forest-trees. In\r\nthe old days, the Knights Templars of the Commanderie of Reims had\r\nthe right of _vinage_ at Ludes, and exacted their modest 'pot' (about\r\nhalf a gallon) per pièce on all the wine the village produced. On our\r\nleft hand is Mailly, the vineyards of which join those of Verzenay,\r\nand, though classed only as a second cru, yielding a wine noted for\r\n_finesse_ and bouquet, identified by some as the vintage which was\r\nrecommended in the ninth century to Bishop Hincmar of Reims by his\r\n_confrère_, Pardulus of Laon. From the wooded knolls hereabouts a view\r\nis gained of the broad plains of the Champagne, dotted with white\r\nvillages and scattered homesteads among the poplars and the limes, the\r\nwinding Vesle glittering in the sunlight, and the dark towers of Notre\r\nDame de Reims, with all their rich Gothic fretwork, rising majestically\r\nabove the distant city.\r\n\r\nAt one vendangeoir we visited, at Mailly, between 350 and 400 pièces\r\nof wine were being made at the rate of some thirty pièces during\r\nthe long day of twenty hours, five men being engaged in working the\r\nold-fashioned press, closely resembling a cider-press, and applying\r\nits pressure longitudinally. This ancient press doubtless differs but\r\nlittle from the one which the chapter of Reims Cathedral possessed\r\nat Mailly in 1384. As soon as the must was expressed it was emptied\r\ninto large vats, holding about 450 gallons, and in these it remained\r\nfor several days before being drawn off into casks. Of the above\r\nthirty pièces, twenty resulting from the first pressure were of the\r\nfinest quality, while four produced by the second pressure were partly\r\nreserved to replace what the first might lose during fermentation, the\r\nresidue serving for second-class Champagne. The six pièces which came\r\nfrom the final pressure, after being mixed with common wine of the\r\ndistrict, were converted into Champagne of an inferior quality.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VINEYARDS OF BOUZY.]\r\n\r\nWe now crossed the mountain, sighting Ville-en-Selve--the village in\r\nthe wood--among the distant trees, and eventually reached Louvois,\r\nwhence the Grand Monarque's domineering war minister derived his\r\nmarquisate, and where his château, a plain but capacious edifice,\r\nmay still be seen nestled in a picturesque and fertile valley, and\r\nsurrounded by lordly pleasure-grounds. Château and park are to-day the\r\nproperty of M. Frédéric Chandon, who has bestowed much care on the\r\nrestoration of the former. Soon after we left Louvois the vineyards of\r\nBouzy appeared in sight, with the prosperous-looking little village\r\nrising out of the plain at the foot of the vine-clad slopes stretching\r\nto Ambonnay, and the glittering Marne streaking the hazy distance. The\r\ncommodious new church is said to have been indebted for its spire to\r\nthe lucky gainer--who chanced to be a native of Bouzy--of the great\r\ngold ingot lottery prize, value 16,000_l._, drawn in Paris some years\r\nago. The Bouzy vineyards occupy a series of gentle inclines, and have\r\nthe advantage of a full southern aspect. The soil, which is of the\r\ncustomary calcareous formation, has a marked ruddy tinge, indicative of\r\nthe presence of iron, to which the wine is in some degree indebted for\r\nits distinguishing characteristics--its delicacy, spirituousness, and\r\npleasant bouquet. Vintagers were passing slowly in between the vines,\r\nand carts laden with grapes came rolling over the dusty roads. The\r\nmountain which rises behind the vineyards is scored up its sides and\r\nfringed with foliage at its summit, and a small stone bridge crosses\r\nthe deep ravine formed by the swift-descending winter torrents.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VENDANGEOIR OF M. WERLÉ AT BOUZY.]\r\n\r\nThe principal vineyard proprietors at Bouzy, which ranks, of course, as\r\na _premier cru_, are M. Werlé, M. Irroy, and Messrs. Moët & Chandon,\r\nthe first and last of whom have capacious vendangeoirs here, M. Irroy's\r\npressing-house being in the neighbouring village of Ambonnay. M. Werlé\r\npossesses at Bouzy from forty to fifty acres of the finest vines,\r\nforming a considerable proportion of the entire vineyard area. At the\r\nClicquot-Werlé vendangeoir, containing as many as eight presses, about\r\n1000 pièces of wine are made annually. At the time of our visit, grapes\r\ngathered that morning were in course of delivery, the big basketfuls\r\nbeing measured off in caques--wooden receptacles holding two-and-twenty\r\ngallons--while the florid-faced foreman ticked them off with a piece of\r\nchalk on the head of an adjacent cask.\r\n\r\nAs soon as the contents of some half-hundred or so of these baskets\r\nhad been emptied on to the floor of the press, the grapes undetached\r\nfrom their stalks were smoothed compactly down, and a moderate pressure\r\nwas applied to them by turning a huge wheel, which caused the screw of\r\nthe press to act--a gradual squeeze rather than a powerful one, and\r\ngiven all at once, coaxing out, it was said, the finer qualities of the\r\nfruit. The operation was repeated as many as six times; the yield from\r\nthe three first pressures being reserved for conversion into Champagne,\r\nwhile the result of the fourth squeeze would be applied to replenishing\r\nthe loss, averaging 7-1/2 per cent, sustained by the must during\r\nfermentation. Whatever comes from the fifth pressure is sold to make an\r\ninferior Champagne. The grapes are subsequently well raked about, and\r\nthen subjected to a couple of final squeezes, known as the _rébêche_,\r\nand yielding a sort of _piquette_, given to the workmen employed at the\r\npressoir to drink.\r\n\r\nThe small quantity of still red Bouzy wine made by M. Werlé at the\r\nsame vendangeoir only claims to be regarded as a wine of especial mark\r\nin good years. The grapes, before being placed beneath the press,\r\nare allowed to remain in a vat for as many as eight days. The must\r\nundergoes a long fermentation, and after being drawn off into casks is\r\nleft undisturbed for a couple of years. In bottle--where, by the way,\r\nit invariably deposits a sediment, which is indeed the case with all\r\nthe wines of the Champagne, still or sparkling--it will outlive, we\r\nwere told, any Burgundy.\r\n\r\nStill red Bouzy has a marked and agreeable bouquet and a most delicate\r\nflavour, is deliciously smooth to the palate, and to all appearances is\r\nas light as a wine of Bordeaux, while in reality it is quite as strong\r\nas Burgundy, to the finer crus of which it bears a slight resemblance.\r\nIt was, we learnt, very susceptible to travelling, a mere journey to\r\nParis being, it was said, sufficient to sicken it, and impart such a\r\nshock to its delicate constitution that it was unlikely to recover from\r\nit. To attain perfection, this wine, which is what the French term a\r\n_vin vif_, penetrating into the remotest corners of the organ of taste,\r\nrequires to be kept a couple of years in wood and half a dozen or more\r\nyears in bottle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE AMBONNAY VINEYARDS.]\r\n\r\nFrom Bouzy it was only a short distance along the base of the\r\nvine-slopes to Ambonnay, where there are merely two or three hundred\r\nacres of vines, and where we found the vintage almost over. The village\r\nis girt with fir-trees, and surrounded with rising ground fringed\r\neither with solid belts or slender strips of foliage. An occasional\r\nwindmill cuts against the horizon, which is bounded here and there by\r\nscattered trees. Inquiring for the largest vine-proprietor, we were\r\ndirected to an open porte-cochère, and on entering the large court\r\nencountered half a dozen labouring men engaged in various farming\r\noccupations. Addressing one whom we took to be the foreman, he referred\r\nus to a wiry little old man, in shirt-sleeves and sabots, absorbed\r\nin the refreshing pursuit of turning over a big heap of rich manure\r\nwith a fork. He proved to be M. Oury, the owner of we forget how many\r\nacres of vines, and a remarkably intelligent peasant, considering\r\nwhat dunderheads the French peasants as a rule are, who had raised\r\nhimself to the position of a large vine-proprietor. Doffing his sabots\r\nand donning a clean blouse, he conducted us into his little salon, a\r\nfreshly-painted apartment about eight feet square, of which the huge\r\nfireplace occupied fully one-third, and submitted patiently to our\r\ncatechising.\r\n\r\nAt Ambonnay, as at Bouzy, they had that year, M. Oury said, only half\r\nan average crop; the caque of grapes had, moreover, sold for exactly\r\nthe same price at both places, and the wine had realised about 800\r\nfrancs the pièce. Each hectare (2-1/2 acres) of vines had yielded\r\n45 caques of grapes, weighing some 2-3/4 tons, which produced 6-1/2\r\npièces, equal to 286 gallons of wine, or at the rate of 110 gallons\r\nper acre. Here the grapes were pressed four times, the yield from the\r\nsecond pressure being used principally to make good the loss which the\r\nfirst sustained during its fermentation. As the squeezes given were\r\npowerful ones, all the best qualities of the grapes were by this time\r\nextracted, and the yield from the third and fourth pressures would not\r\ncommand more than eighty francs the pièce. The vintagers who came from\r\na distance received either a franc and a half per day and their food,\r\nconsisting of three meals, or two francs and a half without food, the\r\nchildren being paid thirty sous. M. Oury further informed us that every\r\nyear vineyards came into the market, and found ready purchasers at from\r\nfifteen to twenty thousand francs the hectare, equal to an average\r\nprice of 300_l._ the acre, which, although Ambonnay is classed merely\r\nas a second cru, has since risen in particular instances to upwards\r\nof 600_l._ per acre. Owing to the properties being divided into such\r\ninfinitesimal portions, they were not always bought up by the large\r\nChampagne houses, who objected to be embarrassed with the cultivation\r\nof such tiny plots, preferring rather to buy the produce from their\r\nowners.\r\n\r\nThere are other vineyards of lesser note in the neighbourhood of\r\nReims producing very fair wines, which enter more or less into the\r\ncomposition of Champagne, and almost all of which can boast of a\r\npedigree extending back at least to the Middle Ages. Noticeable among\r\nthese are Ville-Dommange and Sacy, south-west of Reims. At Sacy the\r\nAbbey of St. Remi had a vineyard in 1218; and in the return of church\r\nproperty made in 1384, the doyen of the Cathedral is credited with\r\n'rentes de vin' and about six _jours_ of vineland here, the Convent of\r\nClermares at Reims owning a piece of 'vigne gonesse.' North-west of\r\nthe city the best-known vineyards are those of Hermonville--mentioned\r\nlikewise at the beginning of the thirteenth century, and in the return\r\nwhich we have just quoted--and St. Thierry, where the Black Prince\r\ntook up his quarters during the siege of Reims, and where Gerard de la\r\nRoche wrought such havoc amongst the vines in the twelfth century, to\r\nthe great indignation of their monkish owners. The still red wine of\r\nSt. Thierry, which recalls the growths of the Médoc by its tannin, and\r\nthose of the Côte d'Or by its vinosity, is to-day almost a thing of the\r\npast, it being found here, as elsewhere, more profitable to press the\r\ngrapes for sparkling in preference to still wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: LABOURERS AT WORK IN THE EARLY SPRING IN M.

In the first place, the soil\r\nimparts to the natural wine a special quality which it has been found\r\nimpossible to imitate in any other quarter of the globe. To the wine\r\nof Ay it lends a flavour of peaches, and to that of Avenay the savour\r\nof strawberries; the vintage of Hautvillers, though somewhat fallen\r\nfrom its former high estate, is yet marked by an unmistakably nutty\r\ntaste; while that of Pierry smacks of the locally-abounding flint, the\r\nwell-known _pierre à fusil_ flavour. So, on the principle that a little\r\nleaven leavens the whole lump, the produce of grapes grown in the\r\nmore favoured vineyards is added in definite proportions, in order to\r\nsecure certain special characteristics, as well as to maintain a fixed\r\nstandard of excellence.\r\n\r\nWhile it is admitted that climate is not without its influence in\r\nimparting a delicate sweetness and aroma, combined with finesse and\r\nlightness, to the wine, some authorities maintain that to the careful\r\nselection of the vines best suited to the soil and temperature of the\r\ndistrict the excellence of genuine Champagne is mainly to be ascribed.\r\n\r\nFour descriptions of vines are chiefly cultivated in the Champagne,\r\nthree of them yielding black grapes, and all belonging to the pineau\r\nvariety, from which the grand Burgundy wines are produced, and so\r\nstyled from the clusters taking the conical form of the pine. The first\r\nis the franc pineau, the plant doré of Ay, with its closely-jointed\r\nshoots and small leaves, producing squat bunches of small round\r\ngrapes, with thickish skins of a bluish-black tint, and sweet and\r\nrefined in flavour. The next is the plant vert doré, with its leaves\r\nof vivid green, more robust and more productive than the former, but\r\nyielding a less generous wine, and the berries of which, growing in\r\ncompact pyramidal bunches, are dark and oval, very thin-skinned, and\r\nremarkably sweet and juicy. The third variety, extensively planted in\r\nthe vineyards of Verzy and Verzenay, is the plant gris, or burot, as it\r\nis styled in the Côte d'Or, a somewhat delicate vine, whose fruit has\r\na brownish tinge, and yields a light and perfumed wine. The remaining\r\nspecies is a white grape known as the épinette, a variety of the\r\npineau blanc, and supposed by some to be identical with the chardonnet\r\nof Burgundy, which yields the famous wine of Montrachet. It is met\r\nwith all along the Côte d'Avize, notably at Cramant, the delicate and\r\nelegant wine of which ranks immediately after that of Ay and Verzenay.\r\nThe épinette is a prolific bearer, and its round transparent golden\r\nberries, which hang in somewhat straggling clusters amongst its\r\ndark-green leaves, are both juicy and sweet. It ripens, however, much\r\nlater than either of the black varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TYPES OF THE CHAMPAGNE VINES IN BEARING.]\r\n\r\nThere are several other species of vines cultivated in the Champagne\r\nvineyards, notably the common meunier, or miller, prevalent in the\r\nvalley of Epernay, which bears black grapes, and takes its name from\r\nthe young leaves appearing to have been sprinkled with flour. This\r\nvariety being more hardy than the franc pineau is replacing the\r\nlatter on the lower parts of the slopes, which are the most exposed\r\nto frosts--a regrettable circumstance, as it impairs the quality of\r\nthe wine. There are also the black and white gouais; the meslier, a\r\nprolific white variety yielding a wine of fair quality; the black and\r\nwhite gamais, the leading grape in the Mâconnais, and chiefly found in\r\nsome of the Vertus vineyards; together with the tourlon, the marmot,\r\nthe cohéras, the plant doux, and half a score of others.\r\n\r\nThe land in the Champagne, as in other parts of France, is minutely\r\nsubdivided, and it has been estimated that the 40,000 acres of\r\nvines are divided amongst no less than 16,000 proprietors. A few of\r\nthe principal Champagne firms are large owners of vineyards; and\r\nas the value of the soil has more than quadrupled within the last\r\nthirty years, even the smallest peasant proprietors have cause for\r\ncongratulation.[407] These latter cultivate their vineyards themselves;\r\nwhile the larger landowners employ labourers, termed _forains_ when\r\ncoming from a distance and working by the week for their lodging, food,\r\nand from 20 to 30 francs wages, or _tâcherons_ when paid by the job.\r\nThe last-mentioned class usually contract to cultivate and dress an\r\narpent of vines, exclusive of the vintage, at from 8_l._ to 12_l._ per\r\nannum.\r\n\r\nIn the Champagne the old rule holds good--poor soil, rich product,\r\ngrand wine in moderate quantity. The soil of the vineyards is chalk,\r\nwith a mixture of silica and light clay, combined with a varying\r\nproportion of oxide of iron. Many of the best have a substratum\r\nof stones and sand, and a thin superstratum of vegetable earth.\r\nThe ruddier the soil, and consequently the more impregnated with\r\nferruginous earth, the better suited it is found to the cultivation of\r\nblack grapes; whilst the gray or yellowish soils, such as abound in the\r\nCôte d'Avize, are preferable for the white varieties.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MANURING THE NEWLY-PLANTED YOUNG VINES.]\r\n\r\nThe vines are almost invariably planted on rising ground, the lower\r\nslopes, which seldom escape the spring frosts, producing the best\r\nwines. The vines are placed very close together, there often being\r\nas many as six within a square yard, and the result is that they\r\nreciprocally impoverish each other. Planting takes place between\r\nNovember and April, the vine-growers of the River being usually in\r\nadvance of those of the Mountain in this operation. Plants two or\r\nthree years old and raised in nurseries are usually made use of. These\r\nare placed either in holes or trenches. The roots have a little earth\r\nsprinkled over them, to which a liberal supply of manure or compost is\r\nadded, and the holes having been filled up and trodden, the vines are\r\npruned down to a couple of buds above the ground.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINE PREPARED FOR 'PROVINAGE.']\r\n\r\nIn the course of two or three years they are ready for the operation\r\nof 'provinage,' or layering, a method of multiplication universally\r\npractised in the Champagne. This consists in burying in a trench, from\r\nsix to eight inches deep dug on one side of the plant, two or more of\r\nthe principal shoots, left when the vine was pruned for this especial\r\npurpose. The whole of the two-years'-old wood is thus buried, and\r\nthe ends of the shoots of one-year-old, which are left above ground,\r\nare cut down to the second bud. The shoots thus laid underground are\r\ndressed with a light manure, and in course of time take root and form\r\nnew vines, which bear during their second year. This operation is\r\nperformed simultaneously with the 'bêchage' in the early spring, and\r\nis annually repeated until the vine is five years old, the plants thus\r\nbeing in a state of continual progression; a system which accounts for\r\nthe juvenescent aspect of the Champagne vineyards, where none of the\r\nwood of the vines showing above ground is more than three years old.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PLAN OF 'PROVINAGE À L'ÉCART' IN A NEWLY-PLANTED\r\nVINEYARD.]\r\n\r\nThe two principal plans adopted in provining are styled the 'écart' and\r\nthe 'avance.' In the first, which is usually followed in newly-planted\r\nvineyards, the two shoots are carried forward to the right and left--so\r\nas to form the two base points of an equilateral triangle, of which the\r\npoint of departure is the summit--and are maintained in this position\r\nby the aid of wooden or iron pegs. In the 'provinage à l'avance' both\r\nshoots are carried forward in the same direction, and sometimes a\r\nvariation embodying the two systems is employed.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROVINAGE À L'ÉCART.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PROVINAGE À L'AVANCE.]\r\n\r\nWhen the vine has attained its fifth year it is allowed to rest for a\r\ncouple of years, and then the provining is resumed, the shoots being\r\ndispersed in any direction throughout the vineyard, so as to fill up\r\nvacancies. The plants remain in this condition henceforward, merely\r\nrequiring to be renewed from time to time by judicious provining. For\r\ninstance, it is sometimes found necessary to bend one of the shoots\r\nround into a circle, so that its end may issue from the ground at\r\nthe point occupied by the parent stock. The system of provinage is\r\nsometimes carried to excess in the Champagne, with a view of increasing\r\nthe yield of wine, which suffers, however, in quality. The network of\r\nroots, too, renders the various operations of cultivation difficult and\r\ndangerous, as they are liable to be injured by the short-handled hoe in\r\nuniversal use among the Champenois vine-dressers.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TRIPLE 'PROVINAGE' TO REPLACE THE PARENT STOCK.]\r\n\r\nViticulturists inclined to make experiments have tried the system of\r\narranging the vines in transverse and longitudinal lines, quincunxes,\r\n&c., or have replaced their vine-stakes with iron wires supported by\r\nwooden pickets. Some of these experiments have proved successful,\r\nalthough none of them are as yet in general use.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINE DRESSER'S HOE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINE PRIOR TO THE FEBRUARY PRUNING, SHOWING THE EXTENT\r\nOF ROOT.]\r\n\r\nThe first operation of importance carried out during the year in the\r\nvineyards is the 'taille,' or pruning, which takes place in February,\r\nand consists in cutting away the superfluous shoots, simply leaving\r\none--or, if it is intended to multiply by provinage, two--on each\r\nstock. This is followed about March or April by the 'bêchage,' or\r\n'hoyerie'--that is, the digging round the roots of the vine--with which\r\nis combined the provinage. A trench being opened, as already noted, and\r\nthe vine laid bare to the roots, it is bent down so that, on filling\r\nup the trench with earth and manure, the stock is entirely covered and\r\nonly the new wood appears above ground. This new wood is then shortened\r\nback, and the stakes intended for the support of the vines are fixed in\r\nthe ground. These stakes are set up in the spring of the year by men\r\nor women, the former of whom force them into the ground by pressing\r\nagainst them with their chest, which is protected with a shield of\r\nwood. The women use a mallet, or have recourse to a special appliance,\r\nin working which the foot plays the principal part. The latter method\r\nis the least fatiguing, and in some localities is practised by the men.\r\nAn expert labourer will set up as many as 5000 stakes in the course of\r\nthe day. When of oak these stakes cost sixty francs the thousand; and\r\nas the close system of plantation followed in the Champagne renders the\r\nemployment of no less than 24,000 stakes necessary on every acre of\r\nland, the cost per acre of propping up the vines amounts to upwards of\r\n57_l._, or more than treble what it is in the Médoc and quadruple what\r\nit is in Burgundy. The stakes last only some fifteen years, and their\r\nrenewal forms a serious item in the vine-grower's budget.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINES IN FEBRUARY AFTER THE 'TAILLE.']\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE 'BÊCHAGE' OF THE VINES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PUTTING STAKES TO THE VINES IN THE SPRING.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: APPARATUS FOR FIXING VINE-STAKES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNSTACKING THE VINE-STAKES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: NEWLY-STAKED VINES AFTER THE 'BÊCHAGE.']\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINES IN AUTUMN AFTER THE VINTAGE.]\r\n\r\nIn May or June, after the vines have been hoed around their roots,\r\nthey are secured to the stakes, and their tops are broken off at a\r\nshoot to prevent them from growing above the regulation height, which\r\nis ordinarily from 30 to 33 inches. They are liberally manured with a\r\nkind of compost formed of the loose friable soil termed 'cendre'--dug\r\nout from the sides of the hills, and of supposed volcanic origin--mixed\r\nwith animal and vegetable refuse. The vines are shortened back while in\r\nflower, and in the course of the summer the ground is hoed a second and\r\na third time, the object being, first, to destroy the superficial roots\r\nof the vines and force the plants to live solely on their deep roots;\r\nand secondly, to remove all pernicious weeds from round about them.\r\nAfter the third hoeing, which takes place in the middle of August,\r\nthe vines are left to themselves until the period of the vintage,\r\nexcepting that some growers remove a portion of the leaves in order\r\nthat the grapes may receive the full benefit of the sun, and raise up\r\nthose bunches that rest upon the ground. The vintage over, the stakes\r\nsupporting the vines are pulled up later in the autumn and stacked in\r\ncompact masses, styled 'moyères,' with their ends out of the ground,\r\nor else 'en chevalet,' the vine, which is left curled up in a heap,\r\nremaining undisturbed until the winter, when the earth around it is\r\nloosened. In the month of February following the vine is pruned and\r\nsubsequently sunk into the earth, as already described, so as to leave\r\nonly the new wood above ground. Owing to the vines being planted so\r\nclosely together they naturally starve one another, and numbers of them\r\nperish. Whenever this is the case, or the stems chance to get broken\r\nduring the vintage, their places are filled up by provining.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STACKING STAKES 'EN CHEVALET.']\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STACKING STAKES IN A 'MOYÈRE.']\r\n\r\nThe vignerons of the Champagne regard the numerous stakes which support\r\nthe vines as affording some protection against the white frosts of the\r\nspring. To guard against the dreaded effects of these frosts, which\r\ninvariably occur between early dawn and sunrise, and the loss arising\r\nfrom which is estimated to amount annually to 25 per cent, some of\r\nthe cultivators place heaps of hay, fagots, dead leaves, &c., about\r\ntwenty yards apart, taking care to keep them moderately damp. When a\r\nfrost is feared the heaps on the side of a vineyard whence the wind\r\nblows are set light to, whereupon the dense smoke which rises spreads\r\nhorizontally over the vines, producing the same result as an actual\r\ncloud, intercepting the rays of the sun, warming the atmosphere, and\r\nconverting the frost into dew. Among other methods adopted to shield\r\nthe vines from frosts is the joining of branches of broom together in\r\nthe form of a fan, and afterwards fastening them to the end of a pole,\r\nwhich is placed obliquely in the ground, so that the fan may incline\r\nover the vine and protect it from the sun's rays. A single labourer\r\ncan plant, it is said, as many as eight thousand of these fans in the\r\nground during a long day.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: UNROLLING MATTING FOR ROOFING THE VINES WITH.]\r\n\r\nDr. Guyot's system of roofing the vines with straw matting, to protect\r\nthem alike against frosts and hailstorms, is very generally followed\r\nin low situations in the Champagne, the value of the wine admitting\r\nof so considerable an expense being incurred. This matting, which is\r\nmade about a foot and a half in width, and in rolls of great length,\r\nis fastened either with twine or wire to the vine-stakes; and it is\r\nestimated that half a dozen men can fix nearly 11,000 yards of it, or\r\nsufficient to roof over 2-1/2 acres of vines, during an ordinary day.\r\nTo carry out the system properly, a double row of tall and short stakes\r\nconnected with iron wires has to be provided. The matting can then be\r\nused as a shelter to the young vines in spring, as a south wall to aid\r\nthe ripening of the grapes in summer, and as a protection against rain\r\nand autumn frosts.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MATTING ARRANGED TO AID THE RIPENING OF THE GRAPES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MATTING ARRANGED TO PROTECT THE VINES AGAINST AUTUMN\r\nFROSTS.]\r\n\r\nOwing to the system of cultivation by rejuvenescence, and the constant\r\nreplenishing of the soil by well-compounded manures, the Champenois\r\nwine-growers entertain great hopes that their vineyards will escape\r\nthe ravages of the phylloxera vastatrix. They certainly deserve such\r\nan immunity, for, according to Dr. Plonquet of Ay, they are already\r\nthe prey of no less than fifteen varieties of insects, which feed\r\nupon the leaves, stalks, roots, or fruit of the vines. One of the\r\nmost destructive of these is the eumolpe, gribouri, or écrivain as it\r\nis popularly styled, from the traces it leaves upon the vine-leaves\r\nbearing some resemblance to lines of writing. It is a species of\r\nbeetle, the larvæ of which pass the winter amongst the roots of the\r\nvine, and in the spring attack the young leaves and buds, their ravages\r\noften proving fatal to the plant. Then there is the chabot, which\r\nhas caused great destruction at Verzy and Verzenay; the attelabe,\r\ncunche, or bêche, which rolls up the leaves of the vine like cigars,\r\nand seems to be identical with the hurebet or urbec of the Middle\r\nAges; and the cochylis, teigne, or vintage-worm, which develops into\r\na white-and-black butterfly, producing in the course of the year two\r\ngenerations of larvæ, having the form of small red caterpillars, one\r\nof which attacks the blossoms of the vine, while the second pierces\r\nand destroys the grapes themselves. The list of foes further comprises\r\nthe altise, a kind of beetle allied to the gribouri; the liset or\r\ncoupe-bourgeon, a tiny worm assailing the first sprouting shoots; and\r\nthe hanneton or cockchafer.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MATTING ARRANGED TO KEEP OFF RAIN OR HAIL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PYRALE.]\r\n\r\nThe greatest havoc, however, appears to be wrought by the pyrale, a\r\nspecies of caterpillar, which feeds on the young leaves, flowers,\r\nand shoots until the vine is left completely bare. The larva of this\r\ninsect, after passing the winter either in the crevices of the stakes\r\nor in the cracks in the bark of the vine, emerges in the spring,\r\ndevours leaves, buds, and shoots indifferently, and eventually becomes\r\ntransformed into a small yellow-and-brown butterfly, which deposits\r\nits eggs amongst the bunches of grapes in July. Between 1850 and 1860\r\nthe vineyards of Ay were devastated by the pyrale, which, like the\r\nlocusts of Scripture, spared no green thing; and all the efforts made\r\nto rid them of this scourge proved ineffectual until the wet and cold\r\nweather of 1860 put a stop to the insect's ravages.[408] More recently\r\nit was discovered that its attacks could be checked by sulphurous\r\nacid, or by scalding the stakes and the vine-stocks with boiling water\r\nduring the winter. Nevertheless, it appeared impossible to check its\r\ndestructiveness at Ay, where it made its reappearance in 1879, and\r\ncaused an immense amount of damage. On this occasion an ingenious\r\ngentleman, M. Testulat Gaspar, was seized with the idea of combating\r\nthe pyrale by means of the electric light. His theory was, that on\r\na powerful light being exhibited in a central position at midnight\r\namongst the vineyards, with a number of tin reflectors distributed in\r\nevery direction around, the butterflies, roused from slumber, would\r\nwing their way in myriads towards the latter, when their flight could\r\nbe arrested by sheets of muslin stretched between poles, smeared with\r\nhoney and baited with a dash of Champagne liqueur. The theory was put\r\nto the test in August 1879, amongst the vineyards between Dizy and Ay,\r\nwhere the pyrale was committing the greatest ravages. The light was\r\nturned on, and the butterflies rose 'in millions;' but they failed to\r\nflock to the reflectors, and the honey-smeared muslin proved quite\r\nuseless to secure the few which came in contact with it.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: A VINTAGE SCENE IN THE CHAMPAGNE.]\r\n\r\n                                  IV.\r\n\r\n                    /The Vintage in the Champagne./\r\n\r\n    Period of the Champagne vintage--Vintagers summoned by\r\n    beat of drum--Early morning the best time for plucking\r\n    the grapes--Excitement in the neighbouring villages at\r\n    vintage-time--Vintagers at work--Mules employed to convey the\r\n    gathered grapes down the steeper slopes--The fruit carefully\r\n    examined before being taken to the wine-press--Arrival of the\r\n    grapes at the vendangeoir--They are subjected to three squeezes,\r\n    and then to the 'rébêche'--The must is pumped into casks and left\r\n    to ferment--Only a few of the vine-proprietors in the Champagne\r\n    press their own grapes--The prices the grapes command--Air of\r\n    jollity throughout the district during the vintage--Every one\r\n    is interested in it, and profits by it--Vintagers' fête on St.\r\n    Vincent's-day--Endless philandering between the sturdy sons of toil\r\n    and the sunburnt daughters of labour.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WINE-PRESS IN THE CHAMPAGNE.]\r\n\r\nWhen the weather has been exceedingly propitious, the vintage in the\r\nChampagne commences as early as the third week in September, and in\r\ngood average years the pickers set to work during the first week of\r\nOctober. If, however, the summer has been an indifferent one, and only\r\nan inferior vintage is looked forward to, it is scarcely before the\r\nlatter half of October that the gathering of the grapes is proceeded\r\nwith. There is no vintage-ban in the Champagne, as in Burgundy and\r\nother parts of France; but, as a rule, the growers of Ay and of the\r\nneighbouring slopes commence operations a week or more earlier than\r\nthose of the Mountain of Reims, whilst around Cramant and Avize, the\r\nwhite-grape region, the vintagers usually set to work when in the other\r\ndistricts they have nearly finished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CHAMPAGNE VINTAGE IN THE NEIGHBOURHOOD OF EPERNAY.]\r\n\r\nThe pleasantest season of the year to visit the Champagne is certainly\r\nduring the vintage. When this is about to commence, the vintagers--some\r\nof whom come from Sainte Menehould, forty miles distant, while others\r\nhail from as far as Lorraine--are summoned at daybreak by beat of\r\ndrum in the market-places of the villages adjacent to the vineyards,\r\nand then and there a price is made for the day's labour. This, as we\r\nhave already explained, is generally either a franc and a half, with\r\nfood consisting of three meals, or two francs and a half, rising on\r\nexceptional occasions to three francs, without food, children being\r\npaid a franc and a half. The rate of wage satisfactorily arranged, the\r\ngangs start off to the vineyards, headed by their overseers.\r\n\r\nThe picking ordinarily commences with daylight, and the vintagers\r\nassert that the grapes gathered at sunrise always produce the lightest\r\nand most limpid wine. Moreover by plucking the grapes when the early\r\nmorning sun is upon them, they are believed to yield a fourth more\r\njuice. Later on in the day, too, spite of all precautions, it is\r\nimpossible to prevent some of the detached grapes from partially\r\nfermenting, which frequently suffices to give a slight excess of\r\ncolour to the must, a thing especially to be avoided in a high-class\r\nChampagne. When the grapes have to be transported in open baskets\r\nfor some distance to the press-house, jolting along the road either\r\nin carts or on the backs of mules, and exposed to the torrid rays of\r\na bright autumnal sun, the juice expressed from the fruit, however\r\ndexterously the latter may be squeezed in the press, is occasionally of\r\na positive purple tinge, and consequently useless for conversion into\r\nChampagne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nAt vintage-time everywhere is bustle and excitement; every one is big\r\nwith the business in hand. In these ordinarily quiet little villages\r\nnestling amidst vine clad hollows, or perched half-way up a slope\r\ntinted from base to summit with richly-variegated hues, there is a\r\nperpetual pattering of sabots and a rattling and bumping of wheels over\r\nthe roughly-paved streets. The majority of the inhabitants are afoot:\r\nthe feeble feminine half, baskets on arm, thread their way with the\r\njuveniles through the rows of vines planted half-way up the mountain,\r\nand all aglow with their autumnal glories of green and purple, crimson\r\nand yellow; while the sturdy masculine portion are mostly passing to\r\nand fro between the press-houses and the wine-shops. Carts piled up\r\nwith baskets, or crowded with peasants from a distance on their way\r\nto the vineyards, jostle the low railway-trucks laden with brand-new\r\ncasks, and the somewhat rickety cabriolets of the agents of the big\r\nChampagne houses, who are reduced to clinch their final bargain for a\r\nhundred or more pièces of the peerless wine of Ay or Bouzy, Verzy or\r\nVerzenay, beside the reeking wine-press.\r\n\r\nDotting the steep slopes like a swarm of huge ants are a crowd of men,\r\nwomen, and children, the men, in blue blouses or stripped to their\r\nshirt-sleeves, being for the most part engaged in carrying the baskets\r\nto and fro and loading the carts; whilst the women, in closely-fitting\r\nneat white caps, or wearing old-fashioned unbleached straw-bonnets of\r\nthe contemned coalscuttle type, resembling the 'sun-bonnet' of the\r\nMidland counties, together with the children, are intent on stripping\r\nthe vines of their luscious-looking fruit. They detach the grapes with\r\nscissors or hooked knives, technically termed 'serpettes,' and in some\r\nvineyards proceed to remove all damaged, decayed, or unripe fruit from\r\nthe bunches before placing them in the baskets which they carry on\r\ntheir arms, and the contents of which they empty from time to time into\r\na larger basket resembling an ass's pannier in shape, numbers of these\r\nbeing dispersed about the vineyard for the purpose, and invariably\r\nin the shade. When filled the baskets are carried by a couple of men\r\nto the roadside, along which dwarf stones carved with initials, and\r\nindicating the boundaries of the respective properties, are encountered\r\nevery eight or ten yards, into such narrow strips are the vineyards\r\ndivided. Large carts with railed open sides are continually passing\r\nbackwards and forwards to pick these baskets up; and when one has\r\nsecured its load it is driven slowly to the neighbouring pressoir,\r\nso that the grapes may not be in the least degree shaken, such is\r\nthe care observed throughout every stage of the process of Champagne\r\nmanufacture. When the vineyard slopes are very steep--as, for instance,\r\nat Mareuil--and the paths do not admit of the approach of carts, mules,\r\nequipped with panniers and duly muzzled, are employed to convey the\r\ngathered fruit to the press-house.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn many vineyards the grapes are inspected in bulk instead of in detail\r\nbefore being sent to the wine-press. The hand-baskets, when filled,\r\nare brought to a particular spot, where their contents are minutely\r\nexamined by some half-dozen men and women, who pluck off the bruised,\r\nrotten, and unripe berries, and fling them aside into a separate\r\nbasket. In other vineyards we came upon parties of girls, congregated\r\nround a wicker sieve perched on the top of a large tub by the roadside,\r\nengaged in sorting the grapes, pruning away the diseased stalks, and\r\npicking off all the doubtful berries. The latter were let fall through\r\nthe interstices of the sieve, while the sound fruit was deposited\r\nin large baskets standing beside the sorters, and which, as soon as\r\nthey were filled, were conveyed to the pressoir. When the proprietor\r\nis of an economic turn he usually has the refuse grapes pressed for\r\nwine for home consumption. Spite of the minute examination to which\r\nthe grapes are subjected, a sharp eye will frequently discover in the\r\nheart of what looks like a regular and well-grown bunch a grape that\r\nis absolutely rotten, and capable of infecting its companions when the\r\nwhole are heaped up together in the wine-press.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ARRIVAL OF THE GRAPES AT THE PRESS-HOUSE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VINTAGE IN THE CHAMPAGNE: A WINE-PRESS AT WORK.]\r\n\r\nCarts laden with grapes are continually arriving at the pressoirs,\r\ndischarging their loads and driving off for fresh ones. The piled-up\r\nbaskets, marked with the names of the vineyard-owners whose grapes\r\nthey contain, are temporarily stored under a shed in a cool place,\r\nand are brought into the pressoir from time to time as required. In\r\nthe district of the River the grapes are weighed, while in that of\r\nthe Mountain they are measured, before being emptied on to the floor\r\nof the press. In some places the latter is of the old-fashioned type,\r\nresembling the ordinary cider-press; but usually powerful presses of\r\nmodern invention, worked by a large fly-wheel requiring four sturdy men\r\nto turn it, are employed. The grapes are spread over the floor of the\r\npress in a compact mass, and in some rare cases are lightly trodden\r\nby a couple of men with their naked feet before being subjected to\r\nmechanical pressure, which is again and again repeated, only the first\r\nsqueeze giving a high-class wine, and the second and third a relatively\r\ninferior one. After three pressures the grapes are usually worked about\r\nwith peels, and subjected to a final squeeze known as the 'rébêche,'\r\nwhich produces a sort of _piquette_, given to the workmen to drink, but\r\nin many instances forming the habitual, and indeed only, beverage of\r\nthe economically-inclined peasant proprietor.\r\n\r\nThe must filters through a wicker basket into the reservoir beneath,\r\nwhence, after remaining a certain time to allow of its ridding itself\r\nof the grosser lees, it is pumped through a gutta-percha tube into the\r\ncasks. The wooden stoppers of the bungholes, instead of being fixed\r\ntightly in the apertures, are simply laid over them, and after the\r\nlapse of ten or twelve days fermentation usually commences, and during\r\nits progress the must, which is originally of a pale-pink tint, fades\r\nto a light-straw colour. The wine usually remains undisturbed until\r\nChristmas, when it is drawn off into fresh casks and delivered to the\r\npurchaser.\r\n\r\nOne peculiarity of the Champagne district is that, contrary to the\r\nprevailing practice in the other wine-producing regions of France,\r\nwhere the owner of even a single acre of vines will crush his grapes\r\nhimself, only a limited number of vine-proprietors press their own\r\ngrapes. The large Champagne houses, possessing vineyards, always have\r\ntheir pressoirs in the neighbourhood, and other large vine-proprietors\r\npress the grapes they grow; but the multitude of small cultivators\r\ninvariably sell the produce of their vineyards to one or other of the\r\nformer at a certain rate, either by weight or else by caque, a measure\r\nestimated to hold sixty kilogrammes (equal to 132 lb. avoirdupois) of\r\ngrapes. The price which the fruit fetches varies of course according to\r\nthe quality of the vintage and the requirements of the manufacturers;\r\nbut the average may be taken at about 80 centimes per kilogramme,\r\nequivalent to rather more than 3-1/2_d._ per lb.[409]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf in the Champagne the picturesque rejoicings immortalised in the\r\nItalian vintage scenes of Léopold Robert are lacking, and if the\r\ngrapes, instead of being trodden to the blithe accompaniment of flute\r\nand fiddle, as in some parts of France, are pressed in more quiet\r\nfashion, a pleasant air of jollity nevertheless pervades the district\r\nat the season of the vintage. Every one participates in the interest\r\nwhich this excites. It influences the takings of all the artificers\r\nand all the tradespeople, and brings grist to the mill of the baker\r\nand the bootmaker, as well as to the café and cabaret. The contending\r\ninterests of capital and labour are, moreover, singularly satisfied,\r\nthe vintagers being content at getting their two francs and a half a\r\nday, and the men at the pressoirs their three francs and their food;\r\nthe vineyard proprietor reaping the return of the time, care, and\r\nmoney expended upon his patch of vines, and the Champagne manufacturer\r\nacquiring raw material on sufficiently satisfactory terms, the which,\r\nwhen duly guaranteed by his name and brand, will bring to him both fame\r\nand fortune.\r\n\r\nShould the vintage be a scanty one, the plethoric\r\n_commissionnaires-en-vins_ will wipe their perspiring foreheads with\r\nsatisfaction when they have at last secured the full number of hogsheads\r\nthey had been instructed to buy--at a high figure maybe; still this is\r\nno disadvantage to them, as their commission mounts up the higher. And\r\neven the thickest-skulled among the small vine-proprietors, who make\r\nall their calculations on their fingers, see at a glance that, although\r\nthe crop may be no more than half an average one, they are gainers,\r\nthanks to the ill-disguised anxiety of the agents to secure all the\r\nwine they require, which has the effect of sending prices up to nearly\r\ndouble those of ordinary years, and this with only half the work in the\r\nvineyard and at the winepress to be done.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe vintage in the Champagne comes to a close without any of those\r\nfestivals which still linger in the department of the Gironde. On\r\nthe 22d of January, the fête of St. Vincent, the patron saint of\r\nvine-growers, it is customary, however, for one of the proprietors in\r\neach village to pay for a mass and give a breakfast to his relatives\r\nand friends, at which he presents a bouquet to one of the guests, who,\r\nin his turn, is expected to pay for the mass and give the breakfast\r\nthe year following. On the same day the proprietors entertain their\r\nworkpeople, who, after having eaten and drunk their fill, wind up the\r\nday with song and dance, leading to no end of innocent philandering\r\nbetween the sturdy sons of toil and the sunburnt daughters of labour.\r\nOn these occasions the famous vintage song is sometimes heard:\r\n\r\n    'Vendangeons et vive la France,\r\n    Le monde un jour avec nous trinquera.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DISGORGING, LIQUEURING, CORKING, STRINGING, AND\r\nWIRING OF CHAMPAGNE.]\r\n\r\n                                  V.\r\n\r\n                    /The Preparation of Champagne./\r\n\r\n    The treatment of Champagne after it comes from the wine-press--The\r\n    racking and blending of the wine--The proportions of red and\r\n    white vintages composing the 'cuvée'--Deficiency and excess\r\n    of effervescence--Strength and form of Champagne bottles--The\r\n    'tirage' or bottling of the wine--The process of gas-making\r\n    commences--Details of the origin and development of the\r\n    effervescent properties of Champagne--The inevitable breakage\r\n    of bottles which ensues--This remedied by transferring the wine\r\n    to a lower temperature--The wine stacked in piles--Formation of\r\n    sediment--Bottles placed 'sur pointe' and daily shaken to detach\r\n    the deposit--Effect of this occupation on those incessantly\r\n    engaged in it--The present system originated by a workman of\r\n    Madame Clicquot's--'Claws' and 'masks'--Champagne cellars--Their\r\n    construction and aspect--Raw recruits for the 'Regiment de\r\n    Champagne'--Transforming the 'vin brut' into Champagne--Disgorging\r\n    and liqueuring the wine--The composition of the liqueur--Variation\r\n    in the quantity added to suit diverse national tastes--The corking,\r\n    stringing, wiring, and amalgamating--The wine's agitated existence\r\n    comes to an end--The bottles have their toilettes made--Champagne\r\n    sets out on its beneficial pilgrimage round the world.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe special characteristic of Champagne is that its manufacture only\r\ncommences where that of other wines ordinarily ends. No one would\r\nrecognise in the still brut fluid--which, after being duly racked and\r\nfined, has somewhat the taste and colour of an acrid Rhine wine, with a\r\nmore or less pronounced bitter flavour--that exhilarating essence which\r\nis capable of raising the most depressed spirits, and imparting gaiety\r\nto the dismallest gatherings. Much as Champagne may stand indebted to\r\nNature, soil, climate, and species of vine, the sparkling fluid has\r\ncontracted a far greater debt towards man, to whose incessant labour,\r\npatient skill, and minute precautions it owes that combination of\r\nqualities which causes it to be so highly prized.\r\n\r\nIn the preceding chapter we left the newly-expressed must flowing\r\ndirect from the press into capacious reservoirs, whence it is drawn\r\noff into large vats, where it clears itself by depositing its mucous\r\nlees, usually within twenty-four hours. It is then transferred to new\r\nor perfectly clean casks, holding some forty gallons each, in which a\r\nsulphur match has been previously burnt. These casks are not filled\r\nquite up to the bunghole, which is generally covered with a vine-leaf\r\nkept in its place by a piece of tile. The bulk of the newly-made wine\r\nis left to repose at the vendangeoirs until the commencement of the\r\nfollowing year; still, when the vintage is over, numbers of long narrow\r\ncarts laden with casks of newly-expressed must may be seen rolling\r\nalong the dusty highways, bound for those towns and villages in the\r\ndepartment of the Marne where the manufacture of Champagne is carried\r\non, and where the leading firms have their establishments. Chief\r\namongst these is the cathedral city of Reims, after which comes the\r\nrising town of Epernay, stretching to the very verge of the river; then\r\nAy, nestling between the vine-clad slopes and the Marne canal, with the\r\nneighbouring village of Mareuil; next Pierry; and finally Avize, in\r\nthe centre of the white-grape district southwards of Epernay. Châlons,\r\nowing to its distance from the vineyards, does not usually draw its\r\nsupply of wine until the new year.\r\n\r\nIn the vast celliers of the manufacturers' establishments, where a\r\ntemperature of about 60 to 70 degrees Fahrenheit usually prevails,\r\nthe wine undergoes its first fermentation, entailing a loss of about\r\n7-1/2 per cent, and lasting from a fortnight to a month, according as\r\nto whether the wine be _mou_--that is, rich in sugar--or the reverse.\r\nIn the former case fermentation naturally lasts much longer than when\r\nthe wine is _vert_ or green. This active fermentation is converted\r\ninto latent fermentation by transferring the wine to a cooler cellar,\r\nas it is essential it should retain a certain proportion of its\r\nnatural saccharine to insure its future effervescence. The casks have\r\npreviously been completely filled, and their bungholes tightly stopped,\r\na necessary precaution to guard the wine from absorbing oxygen, the\r\neffect of which would be to turn it yellow, and cause it to lose\r\nsome of its lightness and perfume. After being racked and fined--an\r\noperation generally performed about the third week in December--the\r\nproduce of the different vineyards is ready for mixing together in\r\naccordance with the traditional theories of the various manufacturers;\r\nand should the vintage have been an indifferent one, a certain\r\nproportion of old reserved wine of a good year enters into the blend.\r\n\r\nThe mixing is usually effected in gigantic vats holding at times as\r\nmany as 12,000 gallons each, and having fan-shaped appliances inside,\r\nwhich, on being worked by handles, insure a complete amalgamation\r\nof the wine. This process of marrying wine on a gigantic scale is\r\ntechnically known as making the _cuvée_. Usually four-fifths of\r\nwine obtained from black grapes, and now of a pale-pink hue, are\r\ntempered by one-fifth of the juice of white ones. It is necessary\r\nthat the first should comprise a more or less powerful dash of\r\nthe finer growths both of the Mountain of Reims and of the River;\r\nwhile, as regards the latter, one or other of the delicate vintages\r\nof the Côte d'Avize is essential to the perfect _cuvée_. The aim\r\nis to combine and develop the special qualities of the respective\r\ncrus, body and vinosity being secured by the red vintages of Bouzy\r\nand Verzenay, softness and roundness by those of Ay and Dizy, and\r\nlightness, delicacy, and effervescence by the white growths of Avize\r\nand Cramant. The proportions are never absolute, but vary according to\r\nthe manufacturer's style of wine and the taste of the countries which\r\nform his principal markets. In the opinion of some clever amalgamators,\r\na blend comprising one-third of the vintages of Sillery, Verzenay,\r\nand Bouzy, one-third of those of Mareuil, Ay, and Dizy, and the\r\nremaining third composed of the produce of Pierry, Cramant, and Avize,\r\nconstitutes the wine of Champagne _par excellence_. Others not less\r\nexpert declare that a simple mixture of the Ay, Pierry, and Cramant\r\nvintages furnishes a perfect wine. As when this blending takes place\r\nthe wine is only imperfectly fermented and exceedingly crude, the\r\nreader may imagine the delicacy and discrimination of palate requisite\r\nto judge of the flavour, finesse, and bouquet which the _cuvée_ is\r\nlikely eventually to develop.\r\n\r\nThese, however, are not the only matters to be considered. There is,\r\nabove everything, the effervescence, which depends upon the quantity of\r\ncarbonic acid gas the wine already contains, and the further quantity\r\nit is likely to develop, which depends upon the amount of its natural\r\nsaccharine. After the bottling, if the gas be present in excess, there\r\nwill be a shattering of bottles and a flooding of cellars; while, on\r\nthe other hand, if there be a paucity, the corks will refuse to pop,\r\nand the wine to sparkle aright in the glass. The amount of saccharine\r\nin the _cuvée_ has therefore to be accurately ascertained by means of\r\na glucometer; and should it fail to reach the required standard, as is\r\nthe case at times when the season has been wet and cold and the vintage\r\na poor one, the deficiency is made up by the addition of the purest\r\nsugar-candy. If, on the other hand, there be an excess of saccharine,\r\nthe only thing to be done is to defer the final blending and bottling\r\nof the wine until the superfluous saccharine matter has been absorbed\r\nby fermentation in the cask.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe _cuvée_ completed, the blended wine, which in its present condition\r\ngives to the uninitiated palate no promise of the exquisite delicacy\r\nand aroma it is destined to develop, is drawn off again into casks\r\nfor further treatment. This comprises fining with some gelatinous\r\nsubstance, usually isinglass, made into a jelly and strained through a\r\n'tammy;' while, as a precaution against ropiness and other maladies,\r\nliquid tannin, derived from nut-galls, catechu, or grape husks and\r\npips, is at the same time frequently added to supply the place of the\r\nnatural tannin, which has departed from the wine with its reddish hue\r\nat the epoch of its first fermentation. If at the expiration of a month\r\nthe wine has not become perfectly clear and limpid, it is racked off\r\nthe lees, and the operation of fining is repeated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe operation of bottling the wine next ensues, when the scriptural\r\nadvice not to put new wine into old bottles is rigorously followed. For\r\nthe tremendous pressure of the gas engendered during the subsequent\r\nfermentation of the wine is such that the bottle becomes weakened, and\r\ncan never be safely trusted again.[410] It is because of this pressure\r\nthat the Champagne bottle is one of the strongest made, as indicated by\r\nits weight, which is almost a couple of pounds. To insure this unusual\r\nstrength, it is necessary that the sides should be of equal thickness\r\nand the bottom of a uniform solidity throughout, in order that no\r\nparticular expansion may ensue from sudden changes of temperature. The\r\nneck must, moreover, be perfectly round and widen gradually towards\r\nthe shoulder. In addition--and this is of the utmost consequence--the\r\ninside ought to be perfectly smooth, as a rough interior causes the gas\r\nto make efforts to escape, and thus renders an explosion imminent. The\r\ncomposition of the glass, too, is not without its importance, as on one\r\noccasion a manufactory established for the production of glass by a new\r\nprocess turned out Champagne bottles charged with alkaline sulphurets,\r\nand the consequence was that an entire _cuvée_ was ruined by their\r\nuse, through the reciprocal action of the wine and these sulphurets.\r\nThe acids of the former disengaged hydrosulphuric acid, and instead of\r\nChampagne the result was a new species of mineral water.\r\n\r\nMost of the bottles used for Champagne come from the factories of\r\nLoivre (which supplies the largest quantity), Folembray, Vauxrot, and\r\nQuiquengrogne, and they cost on the average from 28 to 33 francs the\r\nhundred.[411] They are generally tested by a practised hand, who, by\r\nknocking them sharply together, professes to be able to tell, from the\r\nsound that they give, the substance of the glass and its temper, though\r\noccasionally a special machine, subjecting them to hydraulic pressure,\r\nis had recourse to.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe operation of washing, which takes place immediately preceding\r\nthe bottling of the wine, is invariably performed by women, who at\r\nthe larger establishments accomplish it with the aid of machines,\r\nprovided at times with a revolving brush, although small glass beads\r\nare generally used by preference. Each bottle after being washed is\r\nminutely examined, to make certain of its perfect purity, and is then\r\nplaced neck downwards in a tall basket to drain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MACHINE FOR FIXING THE AGRAFES.]\r\n\r\nWith the different Champagne houses the mode of bottling the wine,\r\nwhich may take place any time between April and August, varies in some\r\nmeasure, still the _tirage_, as this operation is called, is ordinarily\r\neffected as follows: The wine, after a preliminary test as to its\r\nfitness for bottling, is emptied from the casks into vats or tuns of\r\nvarying capacity in the _salle du tirage_. From these it flows through\r\npipes into oblong reservoirs, each provided with a row of syphon-taps,\r\non to which the bottles are slipped, and from which the wine ceases to\r\nflow directly the bottles become filled. Men or lads remove the full\r\nbottles, replacing them by empty ones, while other hands convey them to\r\nthe corkers, whose guillotine machines are incessantly in motion. Speed\r\nin the process is of much importance, as during a single day the wine\r\nmay undergo a notable change. From the corkers the bottles are passed\r\non to the _agrafeurs_, who secure the corks by means of an iron clip\r\ntermed an agrafe; and they are afterwards conveyed either to a spacious\r\nroom above-ground known as a cellier or to a cool vault underground,\r\naccording to the number of atmospheres which the wine may indicate.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWith reference to these atmospheres, it should be explained that air\r\ncompressed to half its volume acquires twice its ordinary force, and\r\nto a quarter of its volume quadruple this force--hence the phrase\r\nof two, four, or more atmospheres. The exact degree of pressure is\r\nreadily ascertained by means of a manometer, an instrument resembling\r\na pressure-gauge, with a hollow screw at the base, which is driven\r\nthrough the cork of the bottle. A pressure of 5-3/4 atmospheres\r\nconstitutes what is styled a 'grand mousseux,' and the wine exhibiting\r\nit may be safely conveyed to the coolest subterranean depths, for no\r\ndoubt need be entertained as to its future effervescent properties.\r\nShould the pressure, however, scarcely exceed four atmospheres, it is\r\nadvisable to keep the wine in a cellier above-ground, that it may more\r\nrapidly acquire the requisite sparkling qualities. If fewer than four\r\natmospheres are indicated, it would be necessary to pour the wine back\r\ninto the casks again, and add a certain amount of cane-sugar to it;\r\nbut such an eventuality very rarely happens, thanks to the scientific\r\nformulas and apparatus, which enable the degree of pressure the wine\r\nwill show to be determined beforehand to a nicety. Still mistakes are\r\nsometimes made, and there are instances where charcoal fires have had\r\nto be lighted in the cellars to encourage the latent effervescence to\r\ndevelop itself.[412]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE TIRAGE OR BOTTLING OF CHAMPAGNE.]\r\n\r\nThe bottles are first placed in a horizontal position, the side to be\r\nkept uppermost being indicated by a daub of whitewash, and are stacked\r\nin rows of varying length and depth, one above the other, to about\r\nthe height of a man, with narrow laths between them. Thus they will\r\nspend the summer, providing all goes well; but in about three weeks'\r\ntime the process of gas-making inside the bottles is at its height,\r\nand a period of considerable anxiety to the Champagne manufacturer\r\nensues, through his dread lest an undue number of them should burst\r\nfrom the expansion of the carbonic acid gas generated in the wine. The\r\nglucometer notwithstanding, it is impossible to check a certain amount\r\nof breakage, especially when a hot season has caused the grapes, and\r\nconsequently the raw wine, to be sweeter than usual. Moreover, when\r\nonce _casse_ or breakage sets in on a large scale, the temperature of\r\nthe cellar is raised by the volume of carbonic acid gas let loose,\r\nwhich is not without its effect on the remaining bottles. Not only does\r\nthe increased temperature unduly accelerate fermentation, but the mere\r\nshock of one bottle exploding often starts such of its neighbours as\r\nare predisposed that way, in addition to the direct havoc wrought by\r\nthe heavier fragments of flying glass. The only remedy is the instant\r\nremoval of the wine to a lower temperature whenever this is practicable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA manufacturer of the pre-scientific days of the last century relates\r\nhow one year, when the wine was rich and strong, he only preserved\r\n120 out of 6000 bottles; and it is not long since that 120,000 out of\r\n200,000 were destroyed in the cellars of a well-known Champagne firm.\r\nM. Mauméné, moreover, relates that in 1850 he was called in to consult\r\nabout the checking of a _casse_, which had already reached 96 per\r\ncent.[413] Over-knowing purchasers affect to select a wine which has\r\nexploded in the largest proportion in the cellars, as being well up to\r\nthe mark as regards its effervescence, and are in the habit of making\r\ninquiries as to its performances in this direction.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is evident that, in spite of the teachings of science, the bursting\r\nof Champagne bottles has not yet been reduced to a minimum, for whereas\r\nin some cellars it averages 7 and 8 per cent, and rises to 15 when the\r\npressure is unusually strong, in others it rarely exceeds 2-1/2 or 3.\r\nThe period between May and September is that in which the greatest\r\ndestruction takes place. In the month of October, the first and\r\nseverest breakage being over, the newly-bottled wine is definitively\r\nstacked in the cellars in piles from two to half a dozen bottles deep,\r\nfrom six to seven feet high, and frequently a hundred feet or upwards\r\nin length. Usually the bottles remain in their horizontal position,\r\nin which they gradually develop two essential qualities, that of\r\neffervescing well and that of travelling satisfactorily, for about\r\neighteen or twenty months, though some firms, who pride themselves\r\nupon shipping perfectly matured wines, leave them thus for double this\r\nspace of time. During this period the temperature to which the wine is\r\nexposed is, as far as practicable, carefully regulated; for the risk of\r\nbreakage, though greatly diminished, is never entirely at an end.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nBy this time the fermentation is over; but in the interval, commencing\r\nfrom a few days after the bottling of the wine, a loose dark-brown\r\nsediment has been forming, which has now settled on the lower side of\r\nthe bottle, and to get rid of which is a delicate and tedious task. As\r\nthe time approaches for preparing the wine for shipment, the bottles\r\nare placed _sur pointe_, as it is termed--that is to say, slantingly\r\nin racks with their necks downwards, the inclination being increased\r\nfrom time to time to one more abrupt.[414] The object of this change in\r\ntheir position is to cause the sediment to leave the side of the bottle\r\nwhere it has gathered. Afterwards it becomes necessary to twist and\r\nturn it and coagulate it, as it were, until it forms a kind of muddy\r\nball, and eventually to get it well down into the neck of the bottle,\r\nso that it may be finally expelled with a bang when the temporary cork\r\nis removed and the proper one adjusted. To accomplish this the bottles\r\nare sharply turned in one direction every day for at least a month or\r\nsix weeks, the time being indefinitely extended until the sediment\r\nshows a disposition to settle near the cork. The younger the wine the\r\nlonger the period necessary for the bottles to be shaken, new wine\r\noften requiring as much as three months. Only a thoroughly practised\r\nhand can give the right amount of revolution and the requisite degree\r\nof slope; and in some of the cellars men were pointed out to us who had\r\nacquired such dexterity as to be able at a pinch to shake with their\r\ntwo hands as many as 50,000 bottles in a single day, whilst 30,000 to\r\n40,000 is by no means an uncommon performance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSome of these men have spent thirty or forty years of their lives\r\nengaged in this perpetual task. Fancy being entombed all alone day\r\nafter day in vaults which are invariably dark and gloomy, and often\r\ncold and dank, and being obliged to twist sixty to seventy of these\r\nbottles every minute throughout the day of ten hours! Why, the\r\ntreadmill and the crank, with their periodical respites, must be\r\npastime compared to this maddeningly monotonous occupation, which\r\ncombines hard labour, with the wrist, at any rate, with next to\r\nsolitary confinement. One can understand these men becoming gloomy and\r\ntaciturn, and affirming that they sometimes see devils hovering over\r\nthe bottle-racks and frantically shaking the bottles beside them, or\r\nelse grinning at them as they pursue their humdrum task. Still it may\r\nbe taken for granted that the men who reach this stage are accustomed\r\nto drink freely of raw spirits, as an antidote to the damp to which\r\nthey are exposed, and merely pay the penalty of their over-indulgence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn former times the bottles used to be placed with their heads\r\ndownwards on tables pierced with holes, from which they had to be\r\nremoved and agitated. At a still earlier date the process was more\r\nor less successfully accomplished by holding the bottles upside down\r\nby the neck, tapping them at the bottom to detach the sediment, and\r\nthen, after shaking them well up, laying them on their sides until the\r\noperation was repeated. In 1818, however, a man named Müller, in the\r\nemployment of Madame Clicquot, suggested that the bottles should remain\r\nin the tables whilst being shaken, and further that the holes should\r\nbe cut obliquely, so that they might recline at varying angles. His\r\nsuggestions were privately adopted by Madame Clicquot; but eventually\r\nthe improved plan got wind, and the system which he initiated now\r\nprevails throughout the Champagne.[415]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nWhen the bottles have gone through their regular course of shaking,\r\nthey are examined before a lighted candle to ascertain whether the\r\ndeposit has all fallen on to the cork, and the wine has become\r\nperfectly clear. Sometimes it happens that, twist these men never so\r\nwisely, the deposit, instead of becoming flaky or granular, refuses to\r\nstir, and takes the shape of a bunch of threads technically called a\r\n'claw,' or an adherent membrane styled a 'mask.' When this is the case\r\nan attempt is made to start it by tapping the part to which it adheres\r\nwith a piece of iron, the result being frequently the sudden explosion\r\nof the bottle in the workman's hands. By way of precaution, therefore,\r\nthe operator protects his face with a wire mask, or by gigantic wire\r\nspectacles, which give to him a ghoul-like aspect. Frequently it is\r\nfound impossible to detach the 'mask' from the side of the bottle, and\r\nin this case the only thing that remains is to pour the wine back again\r\ninto the cask, with the view of mixing it in some future _cuvée_.[416]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe cellars of the Champagne manufacturers are very varied in\r\ncharacter. The wine that has been grown on the chalky hills is left to\r\ndevelop itself in vaults burrowed out of the calcareous strata which\r\nunderlie the entire district. In excavating these cellars the sides and\r\nroofs are frequently worked smooth and regular as finished masonry. The\r\nlarger ones are composed of a number of spacious and lofty galleries,\r\nsometimes parallel with each other, but often ramifying in various\r\ndirections, and evidently constructed on no definite plan. They are\r\nof one, two, and, in rare instances, of three stories, and now and\r\nthen consist of a series of parallel galleries communicating with each\r\nother, lined with masonry, and with their stone walls and vaulted roofs\r\nresembling the crypt of some conventual building. Others of ancient\r\ndate are less regular in their form, being merely so many narrow,\r\nlow, winding corridors, varied, perhaps, by recesses hewn roughly out\r\nof the chalk, and resembling the brigands' cave of melodrama; while\r\na certain number of the larger cellars at Reims are simply abandoned\r\nquarries, the broad and lofty arches of which are suggestive of\r\nthe nave and aisles of some Gothic church. In these varied vaults,\r\nlighted by solitary lamps in front of metal reflectors, or by the\r\nflickering tallow candles which we carry in our hands, we pass rows\r\nof casks filled with last year's vintage or reserved wine of former\r\nyears, and piles after piles of bottles of _vin brut_ in seemingly\r\nendless sequence--squares, so to speak, of raw recruits for the\r\nhistorically famous 'Regiment de Champagne'[417]--awaiting their turn\r\nto be thoroughly drilled and disciplined. These are varied by bottles\r\nreposing neck downwards in racks at different degrees of inclination,\r\naccording to the progress their education has attained. Reports caused\r\nby exploding bottles now and then assail the ear, and as the echo dies\r\naway it becomes mingled with the rush of the escaping wine, cascading\r\ndown the pile, and finding its way across the sloping sides of the\r\nfloor to the narrow gutter in the centre. The dampness of the floor and\r\nthe shattered fragments of glass strewn about show the frequency of\r\nthis kind of accident.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DETACHING THE 'MASK' FROM THE SIDES OF THE BOTTLES.]\r\n\r\nIn these subterranean galleries we frequently come upon parties\r\nof workmen engaged in transforming the perfected _vin brut_ into\r\nChampagne. Viewed at a distance while occupied in their monotonous\r\ntask, they present in the semi-obscurity a series of picturesque\r\nRembrandt-like studies. One of the end figures in each group is engaged\r\nin the important process of _dégorgement_, which is performed when the\r\ndeposit, of which we have already spoken, has satisfactorily settled\r\nin the neck of the bottle. Baskets full of bottles with their necks\r\ndownwards are placed beside the operator, who stands before a cask set\r\non end, and having a large oval opening in front. This nimble-fingered\r\nmanipulator seizes a bottle, raises it for a moment before the light to\r\ntest the clearness of the wine and the subsidence of the deposit; holds\r\nit horizontally in his left hand, with the neck directed towards the\r\nopening already mentioned; and with a jerk of the steel hook which he\r\nholds in his right hand loosens the agrafe securing the cork. Bang goes\r\nthe latter, and with it flies out the sediment and a small glassful or\r\nso of wine, further flow being checked by the workman's finger, which\r\nalso serves to remove any sediment yet remaining in the bottle's neck.\r\nLike many other clever tricks, this looks very easy when adroitly\r\nperformed, though a novice would probably allow the bottle to empty\r\nitself by the time he discovered that the cork was out. Yet such is the\r\ndexterity acquired by practice that the average amount of wine, foam,\r\nand deposit ejected by this operation does not exceed one-fourteenth\r\nof the contents of the bottle. Occasionally a bottle bursts in the\r\n_dégorgeur's_ hand, and his face is sometimes scarred from such\r\nexplosions. The sediment removed, the _dégorgeur_ slips a temporary\r\ncork into the bottle, or places the latter in a machine provided with\r\nfixed gutta-percha corks and springs for securing the bottles firmly\r\nin their places. The wine is now ready for the important operation of\r\nthe _dosage_, upon the nature and amount of which the character of\r\nperfected Champagne, whether it be dry or sweet, light or strong, very\r\nmuch depends.[418]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nDifferent manufacturers have different recipes for the composition of\r\nthis syrup, all more or less complex in character, and varying with\r\nthe quality of the wine and the country for which it is intended;\r\nbut the genuine liqueur consists of nothing but old wine of the best\r\nquality, to which a certain amount of sugar-candy and perhaps a dash of\r\nthe finest cognac spirit has been added.[419] The saccharine addition\r\nvaries according to the market for which the wine is destined: thus\r\nthe high-class English buyer demands a dry Champagne, the Russian a\r\nwine sweet and strong as 'ladies' grog,' and the Frenchman and German a\r\nsweet light wine. To the extra-dry Champagnes a modicum dose is added,\r\nwhile the so-called '_brut_' wines receive no more than from one to\r\nthree per cent of liqueur.[420]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn establishments wedded to old-fashioned usages the dose is\r\nadministered with a tin can or ladle; but more generally an ingenious\r\nmachine which regulates the percentage of liqueur to a nicety is\r\nemployed. The bottle being usually nearly full when passed to\r\nthe _doseur_, he, when a heavy percentage of liqueur has to be\r\nadministered, is constrained, under the old system, to pour out some\r\nof the wine to make room for it, and this surplus in many cases is\r\nafterwards transformed into the well-known _tisane de Champagne_.\r\nAs soon as the _dosage_ is accomplished, the bottle is passed to\r\nanother workman known as the _égaliseur_, who fills it up with pure\r\nwine, frequently with a part of that which has been poured out by\r\nthe _doseur_, to the requisite level for corking. In the event of\r\na pink Champagne being required, the wine thus added will be red,\r\nalthough manufacturers of questionable reputation sometimes employ\r\nthe solution of elderberries, known as _teinte de Fismes_, to impart\r\nthat once-favourite roseate hue which has been compared to the glow of\r\nfading sunlight on a crystal stream.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE DOSEUR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CORKER.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE METTEUR DE FIL.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOSING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CORKING MACHINE.]\r\n\r\nThe _égaliseur_ in his turn hands the bottle to the corker, who places\r\nit under a machine furnished with a pair of claws (so as to compress\r\nthe cork to a size sufficiently small to allow it to enter the neck of\r\nthe bottle) and a suspended weight, which in falling drives it home.\r\nThese corks, principally obtained from Catalonia and Andalucia, are\r\nbound to possess a close and regular fibre and perfect elasticity.\r\nThey form no unimportant item in the Champagne manufacturer's budget,\r\ncosting upwards of twopence each, and are delivered in huge sacks\r\nresembling hop-pockets. Previous to being used they are either boiled\r\nin wine or soaked in a solution of tartar, or else they have been\r\nsteamed by the cork merchants, in order to prevent their imparting a\r\nbad flavour to the wine, and to hinder any leakage. They are commonly\r\nhanded warm to the corker, who dips them into a small vessel of wine\r\nbefore making use of them. Some firms, however, prepare their corks by\r\nsubjecting them to cold-water _douches_ a day or two beforehand. The\r\n_ficeleur_ receives the bottle from the corker, and with a twist of the\r\nfingers secures the cork with string, at the same time rounding its\r\nhitherto flat top, at a rate which allows from a thousand to twelve\r\nhundred bottles to pass through his hands in course of the day. The\r\n_metteur de fil_ next affixes the wire with like celerity;[421] and\r\nthen the final operation is performed by a workman seizing a couple of\r\nbottles by the neck and whirling them round his head, as though engaged\r\nin the Indian-club exercise, in order to secure a perfect amalgamation\r\nof the wine and the liqueur.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe final manipulation accomplished, the agitated course of existence\r\nthrough which the wine has been passing at last comes to an end, and\r\nthe bottles are conveyed to another part of the establishment, where\r\nthey repose for several days, or even weeks, in order that the mutual\r\naction of the wine and the liqueur upon each other may be complete.\r\nWhen the time arrives for despatching them, they are confided to\r\nfeminine hands to have their dainty toilettes made, and are tastefully\r\nlabelled, and are either capsuled, or else have their corks and necks\r\nimbedded in sealing-wax or swathed in gold or silver foil, whereby\r\nthey are rendered presentable at the best-appointed tables. All that\r\nnow remains is to wrap them up in coloured tissue-paper, to slip them\r\ninto straw envelopes, or encircle them with wisps of straw, and pack\r\nthem either in cases or baskets for despatch to all quarters of the\r\ncivilised globe.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIt is thus that Champagne sets out on its beneficial pilgrimage to\r\npromote the spread of mirth and light-heartedness, to drive away dull\r\ncare and foment good-fellowship, to comfort the sick and cheer the\r\nsound. Wherever civilisation penetrates, Champagne sooner or later\r\nis sure to follow; and if Queen Victoria's morning drum beats round\r\nthe world, its beat is certain to be echoed before the day is over\r\nby the popping of Champagne corks. Nowadays the exhilarating wine\r\ngraces not merely princely but middle-class dinner-tables, and is the\r\nneedful adjunct at every _petit souper_, as well as the stimulant to\r\nthe wildest revels in all the gayer capitals of the world. It gives a\r\nflush to beauty at garden-parties and picnics, sustains the energies\r\nof the votaries of Terpsichore until the hour of dawn, and imparts to\r\nmany a young gallant the necessary courage to declare his passion. It\r\nenlivens the dullest of _réunions_, brings smiles to the lips of the\r\nsternest cynics, softens the most irascible tempers, and loosens the\r\nmost taciturn tongues.\r\n\r\nThe grim Berliner and the gay Viennese both acknowledge the\r\nexhilarating influence of the wine. Champagne sparkles in crystal\r\ngoblets in the great capital of the North, and the Moslem wipes its\r\ncreamy foam from his beard beneath the very shadow of the mosque of\r\nSt. Sophia; for the Prophet has only forbidden the use of wine, and\r\nof a surety--Allah be praised!--this strangely-sparkling delicious\r\nliquor, which gives to the true believer a foretaste of the joys of\r\nParadise, cannot be wine. At the diamond-fields of South Africa and\r\nthe diggings of Australia the brawny miner who has hit upon a big bit\r\nof crystallised carbon, or a nugget of virgin ore, strolls to the\r\n'saloon' and shouts for Champagne. The mild Hindoo imbibes it quietly,\r\nbut approvingly, as he watches the evolutions of the Nautch girls, and\r\nhis partiality for the wine has already enriched the Anglo-Bengalee\r\nvocabulary and London slang with the word 'simkin.' It is transported\r\non camel-backs across the deserts of Central Asia, and in frail\r\ncanoes up the mighty Amazon. The two-sworded Daimio calls for it in\r\nthe tea-gardens of Yokohama, and the New Yorker, when not rinsing his\r\nstomach by libations of iced water, imbibes it freely at Delmonico's.\r\n\r\nWherever the Romans died they left traces behind them in their quaint\r\nfuneral urns; wherever the civilised man of the nineteenth century has\r\nset his foot--at the base of the Pyramids and at the summit of the\r\nCordilleras, in the mangrove swamps of Ashantee and the gulches of the\r\nGreat Lone Land, in the wilds of the Amoor and on the desert isles\r\nof the Pacific--he has left traces of his presence in the shape of\r\nthe empty bottles that were once full of the sparkling vintage of the\r\nMarne. They are strewn broadcast over the face of the globe, literally\r\nfrom Indus to the Pole. The crews of the Alert and the Discovery\r\nleft them on the ice-bound verge of the paleocrystic sea; the French\r\nexpeditionary columns have scattered them within the limits of the\r\nGreat Sahara. In the lodges of the red man they are found playing the\r\npart of a great medicine, and in the huts of the negro they assume all\r\nthe importance due to a big fetish. Stanley, arriving fainting and\r\nexhausted at the mouth of the Congo, hailed with joy the foil-tipped\r\nflask that the hospitable merchants who answered his appeal for succour\r\nhad despatched; and as he quaffed its contents, recalled how he and\r\nLivingstone, when thousands of miles from any other European, had\r\nemptied a bottle of sparkling Champagne together on the night of their\r\nmemorable meeting at Ujiji. And when, after the battle of Ulundi, the\r\nvictorious British troops occupied Cetewayo's kraal, they found within\r\nthe sable potentate's private chamber several empty Champagne bottles,\r\nthe contents of which, it is to be presumed, he had quaffed the night\r\nbefore to the success of his followers. In the Transvaal too, during\r\nthe negotiations for an armistice, Sir Evelyn Wood regaled the Boer\r\ndelegates with Champagne. On a subsequent occasion, the latter were\r\nunable to return the compliment, excusing themselves by suggestively\r\nremarking, 'We don't take such things with us when we go to fight.'\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RENAISSANCE HOUSE AT REIMS, IN WHICH MADAME CLICQUOT\r\nRESIDED.]\r\n\r\n                                  VI.\r\n\r\n               /Reims and its Champagne Establishments./\r\n\r\n    The city of Reims--Its historical associations--The Cathedral--Its\r\n    western front one of the most splendid conceptions of the\r\n    thirteenth century--The sovereigns crowned within its\r\n    walls--Present aspect of the ancient archiepiscopal city--The\r\n    woollen manufactures and other industries of Reims--The city\r\n    undermined with the cellars of the great Champagne firms--Reims\r\n    hotels--Gothic house in the Rue du Bourg St. Denis--Renaissance\r\n    house in the Rue de Vesle--Church of St. Jacques: its gateway\r\n    and quaint weathercock--The Rue des Tapissiers and the Chapter\r\n    Court--The long tapers used at religious processions--The Place\r\n    des Marchés and its ancient houses--The Hôtel de Ville--Statue\r\n    of Louis XIII.--The Rues de la Prison and du Temple--Messrs.\r\n    Werlé & Co., successors to the Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin--Their\r\n    offices and cellars on the site of a former Commanderie of the\r\n    Templars--Origin of the celebrity of Madame Clicquot's wines--M.\r\n    Werlé and his son--Remains of the Commanderie--The forty-five\r\n    cellars of the Clicquot-Werlé establishment--Our tour of inspection\r\n    through them--Ingenious dosing machine--An explosion and its\r\n    consequences--M.

It is fertile in historical associations, rich in archæological\r\ntreasures, and at the same time able to claim the respect more\r\nreadily accorded in the nineteenth century to a busy and prosperous\r\ncommercial centre. Indeed, its historical, archæological, and\r\ncommercial importance is in advance of its actual political situation,\r\nfor administratively it only ranks as a simple subprefecture in the\r\ndepartment of the Marne. The student of history can hardly afford to\r\nneglect a city so intimately associated with the story of monarchy in\r\nFrance, and one which has witnessed the coronations of a long series of\r\nsovereigns, beginning with Clovis and ending with Charles X. From the\r\nday when the 'proud Sicamber' bent his neck at the adjuration of St.\r\nRemi, and vowed to adore that which he had burnt and to burn that which\r\nhe had adored, down to the time when the future exile of Holyrood had\r\nhis forehead touched by Jean Baptiste Antoine de Latil with the remnant\r\nof the 'sacred pomatum' so miraculously saved from revolutionary\r\nhands, few of the titular rulers of the country have failed to honour\r\nit with their presence. As the Durocortorum of Cæsar, the residence\r\nof Charlemagne, the seat of the great Ecclesiastical Councils of\r\nthe twelfth century, the stronghold of the League, and the scene of\r\none of the first Napoleon's most brilliant feats of arms during the\r\ncampaign of 1813-14, it has also earned for itself a conspicuous place\r\nin history. To Englishmen it is, perhaps, most noteworthy as having\r\nsuccessfully checked the victorious advance of the third Edward after\r\nCressy, and witnessed the apogee of that meteoric career, which began\r\nin the inn-yard at Domremi and ended in the market-place at Rouen,\r\nthe career of Jeanne la Pucelle. Nor must it be forgotten that Reims\r\nsheltered the childhood of Mary Stuart, and saw the heralds of England\r\nhurl solemn defiance at Henri II. in the Abbey of St. Remi, at the\r\ncommand of Mary Tudor.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF REIMS, 1880.]\r\n\r\nTo the archæologist as to the ordinary sightseer, the chief attractions\r\npresented by Reims consist in its numerous ecclesiastical edifices,\r\nsome still serving the purpose for which they were originally erected,\r\nothers long since converted to secular usages. Most conspicuous among\r\nthem is the cathedral church of Notre Dame, the stately basilica\r\nin which the sovereigns of France were wont to be crowned. This\r\nsuperb monument of Gothic architecture was commenced in 1210, upon\r\nthe plans of Robert de Coucy, by Archbishop Alberic de Humbert. It\r\nwas completed at the commencement of the fourteenth century, and\r\nthough the original design was somewhat modified--owing, it is said,\r\nto the contributions of the faithful not coming in with sufficient\r\nrapidity--it remains a marvel of strength, admirably combined with\r\ngrace. The exterior is extremely fine; and the western face, with its\r\nelaborately ornate portal, has been described as 'one of the most\r\nsplendid conceptions of the thirteenth century.'[422] Amidst the almost\r\nbewildering multiplicity of ornament, the triple porch, surmounted\r\nby a group representing the Coronation of the Virgin, the great rose\r\nwindow, flanked by colossal effigies of David and Goliath, and the\r\nrange of statues known as the Gallery of the Kings, running across the\r\nfaçade near its summit, are conspicuous. The interior, although fine,\r\nand containing many objects of interest, is less impressive, while\r\nthe plundered treasury can still boast of many quaint and curious\r\nrelics of bygone times. But the chief interest centres in the fact\r\nof the surrounding walls having witnessed so many scenes of stately\r\npomp and pageantry. St. Louis, Philip the Fair, Philip of Valois,\r\nthe unfortunate John the Good, Charles the Simple, and Charles the\r\nVictorious, with Joan of Arc, standard in hand, by his side; the wily\r\nLouis XI., Louis the Father of his People, the magnificent Francis I.,\r\nand his scarcely less magnificent son, the young husband of Mary Queen\r\nof Scots; the savage Charles IX., Henri III., with his protest that\r\nthe crown hurt him, Louis the Just, the Roi Soleil himself, Louis the\r\nWell-Beloved, the hapless Louis Seize, and Charles X., have all knelt\r\nhere in turns whilst the crown was placed on their heads, the sword\r\ngirded to their sides, and the oriflamme waved above them.\r\n\r\nMany of the most famous cities of the Middle Ages are mere fossilised\r\nrepresentatives of former grandeur, but with Reims the case is\r\notherwise. If somewhat fallen from its former high estate, politically\r\nspeaking--though it should be remembered that Troyes was the titular\r\ncapital of the Champagne when the province was ruled by independent\r\nCounts--its material prosperity has augmented. Round the nucleus of\r\nnarrow and often tortuous streets, representing the old archiepiscopal\r\ncity--the 'Little Rome' of the twelfth century--a network of spacious\r\nthoroughfares and broad boulevards has spread itself, and the life\r\nand movement of a busy manufacturing population are not lacking. In\r\naddition to the wine trade, which of course employs, both directly and\r\nindirectly, a large number of hands, Reims is one of the most important\r\nseats of the woollen manufacture in France, and the industrial element\r\nforms a very important factor amongst its inhabitants. In addition\r\nto the flannels, merinoes, blankets, trouserings, shawls, &c., that\r\nare annually produced, to the value of from thirty to forty million\r\nof francs, there is also a considerable production of gingerbread,\r\nbiscuits, and dried pears, enjoying a wide-spread reputation.\r\n\r\nThe cellars of the great Champagne manufacturers of Reims are scattered\r\nin all directions over the historical old city. They undermine its\r\nnarrowest and most insignificant streets, its broad and handsome\r\nboulevards, and on the eastern side extend beyond its more distant\r\noutskirts. In whichever direction we may elect to proceed when\r\nvisiting the principal Champagne establishments, our starting-point\r\nwill necessarily be the vicinity of the Cathedral, for it is here\r\nthat all the hotels are situated. Facing the great western doorway of\r\nthe ancient Gothic edifice is the Hôtel Lion d'Or, formerly the Hôtel\r\nPetit Moulinet, where the allied sovereigns sojourned on their way to\r\nParis in 1814, and Napoleon rested on his flight after the battle of\r\nWaterloo. Close by is the Hôtel Maison Rouge, with the commemorative\r\ntablet on its renovated façade setting forth that in the year 1429,\r\nat the coronation of Charles VII. in this hostelry, then named the\r\nStriped Ass, the father and mother of Jeanne Darc were lodged at the\r\nexpense of the city council. Almost facing is the newly-erected Grand\r\nHôtel, and on the north-western side of the Cathedral is the Hôtel de\r\nCommerce, the resort, as its name implies, of most of the commercial\r\ntravellers frequenting the capital of the Champagne. The visitor to\r\nReims, be his object business or pleasure, is bound to put up at one\r\nor other of these four hostelries, and hence the starting-point of his\r\nperegrinations is necessarily the same.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOTHIC DOORWAY IN THE RUE DU BOURG ST. DENIS, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nProceeding along the Rue Tronçon Ducoudray, we reached the Rue de\r\nVesle, where the Palais de Justice and the new theatre are situated. In\r\nthe adjacent Rue du Bourg St. Denis is an old house--the ground-floor\r\nof which is a wine-shop styled Buvette du Théâtre--notable for its\r\nantique Gothic doorway, containing, within the upper portion of\r\nthe arch, the bas-relief of a man fighting with a bear. There is a\r\ntradition that on this spot formerly stood a hospital dedicated to St.\r\nHubert, and intended for the reception of persons wounded when hunting,\r\nor who might have chanced to be bitten by mad dogs. In the Rue de Vesle\r\nis another old house with an ornamental frieze surmounting its façade,\r\nwhich looks on to one of the entrances of the Church of St. Jacques.\r\nThis edifice, originally erected at the close of the twelfth century,\r\nis hemmed in on all sides by venerable-looking buildings, while above\r\nthem rises its tapering steeple, surmounted by a mediæval weathercock\r\nin the form of an angel. The interior of the church presents a curious\r\njumble of architectural styles from early Gothic to late Renaissance.\r\nOne noteworthy object of art which it contains is a life-size\r\ncrucifix carved by Pierre Jacques, a Remois sculptor of the days of\r\nthe Good King Henri, and from an anatomical point of view a perfect\r\n_chef-d'[oe]uvre_.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRIEZE OF OLD HOUSE IN THE RUE DE VESLE, REIMS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GATEWAY OF THE CHURCH OF ST. JACQUES, REIMS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WEATHERCOCK OF THE CHURCH OF ST. JACQUES.]\r\n\r\nThe Rue de Vesle merges into the Rue des Tapissiers, where in former\r\ntimes the carpet manufacturers of Reims had their warehouses. In\r\nthe fourteenth and fifteenth centuries the carpets of Reims were as\r\nfamous in France as those of Aubusson are to-day, but subsequently\r\nthey began to decline. Half-way up this street--where, by the way, in\r\n1694 the first numbers of the _Gazette de France_, the oldest existing\r\nFrench newspaper, were printed, the news being duly forwarded from\r\nParis--we pass the ancient gateway leading to the chapter-court of\r\nthe Cathedral. Within the court a weekly market of small wares is\r\nnow held; but in the days when the archbishops, dukes, and peers of\r\nReims wielded sovereign sway in the capital of the Champagne, this\r\nopen space was a _champ clos_, where trials by battle took place. The\r\nsurrounding buildings comprised residences for various ecclesiastics\r\nconnected with the Cathedral, together with a small farm whence these\r\nepicurean priests derived their supply of fresh milk and fatted capons.\r\nAccording to ancient custom, the inhabitants of the houses facing the\r\nchapter-gateway were required to keep their doors and windows open on\r\ndays of religious processions, the tapers carried by the clergy on\r\nthese occasions being of such immoderate length that it was necessary\r\nto incline them, and run them into the doors and windows of the houses\r\nopposite when the bearers passed under the archway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GOTHIC HOUSE IN THE MARKET-PLACE, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nAt the end of the Rue des Tapissiers is the handsome Place Royale,\r\nconnected with the Place des Marchés by a broad rectangular street\r\nlined with lofty edifices in the modern Parisian style of architecture.\r\nA break ensues in this range of massive-looking buildings as we enter\r\nthe ancient Place des Marchés, the forum of Roman Reims, and to-day\r\nbordered more or less by houses of a mediæval character, remarkably\r\nwell preserved. Principal among these is a Gothic timber-house of\r\nthe fifteenth century, with its projecting upper stories supported\r\nby elaborately-carved corbels, and its entire façade enriched with\r\nmouldings and finials, and with columns and capitals overlaid with\r\nsculptured ornaments.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF LOUIS XIII. ON THE HÔTEL DE VILLE, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nSome little distance beyond the Place des Marchés is the Place\r\nde l'Hôtel de Ville, which derives all its interest from the\r\nhandsome-looking edifice in the florid Italian style of the early\r\npart of the seventeenth century which gives it its name. The façade\r\nof this building is profusely decorated with Ionic, Doric, and\r\nCorinthian columns, and on the pediment above the principal entrance\r\nis a bas-relief equestrian statue of Louis XIII., whom the Latin\r\ninscription beneath fulsomely characterises as 'the just, the pious,\r\nthe victorious, the clement, the beloved of his people, the terror of\r\nhis enemies, and the delight of the world,' and to whom 'the senate\r\nand inhabitants of Reims have raised this imperishable trophy.' Some\r\ncentury and a half later, however, the imperishable trophy got hurled\r\ndown and shattered into fragments by the populace, and its vacant place\r\nwas only filled by the present statue in the year 1818.\r\n\r\nTo the right of the Place is the Chambre des Notaires of Reims, raised\r\non the site of the ancient _présidial_, or court of justice, where\r\nthe city magistrates used to be elected during the Middle Ages, and\r\nto which a chapel and a prison were attached. The latter building\r\nevidently gave its name to the adjoining Rue de la Prison, the\r\ngloomy-looking houses of which--of a more massive character than the\r\ngabled structures of the market-place and the Rue de l'Etape--with\r\ntheir formidably-barred windows, possible relics of the religious\r\nwars, seem to frown, as it were, upon the passer-by. In a narrow\r\ntortuous street leading from this thoroughfare Messrs. Werlé & Co., the\r\nsuccessors of the famous Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin, have their offices\r\nand cellars, on the site of a former Commanderie of the Templars; and\r\nstrangers passing by this quiet spot would scarcely imagine that under\r\ntheir feet hundreds of busy hands are incessantly at work, disgorging,\r\ndosing, shaking, corking, storing, wiring, labelling, capsuling,\r\nwaxing, tinfoiling, and packing hundreds of thousands of bottles of\r\nChampagne destined for all parts of the civilised world.\r\n\r\nThe house of Clicquot, established in the year 1798 by the husband\r\nof La Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin, who died in 1866, in her 89th year,\r\nwas indebted for much of the celebrity of its wine to the lucky\r\naccident of the Russians occupying Reims in 1814 and 1815, and freely\r\nrequisitioning the sweet Champagne stored in the widow's capacious\r\ncellars. Madame Clicquot's wines were slightly known in Russia prior\r\nto this date; but the officers of the invading army, on their return\r\nhome, proclaimed their merits throughout the length and breadth of\r\nthe Muscovite Empire, and the fortune of the house was made. Madame\r\nClicquot, as every one knows, amassed enormous wealth, and succeeded in\r\nmarrying both her daughter and granddaughter to counts of the _ancien\r\nrégime_.\r\n\r\nThe present head of the firm is M. Werlé, who comes of an old Lorraine\r\nfamily although born in the ancient free imperial town of Wetzlar on\r\nthe Lahn, where Goethe lays the scene of his 'Sorrows of Werther,' the\r\nleading incidents of which really occurred there. M. Werlé entered\r\nthe establishment which he has done so much to raise to its existing\r\nposition so far back as the year 1821. His care and skill, exercised\r\nfor nearly two-thirds of a century, have largely contributed to obtain\r\nfor the Clicquot brand that high repute which it enjoys to-day all over\r\nthe world. M. Werlé, who has long been naturalised in France, was for\r\nmany years Mayor of Reims and President of its Chamber of Commerce, as\r\nwell as one of the deputies of the Marne to the Corps Législatif. He\r\nenjoys the reputation of being the richest man in Reims, and, like his\r\nlate partner, Madame Clicquot, he has also secured brilliant alliances\r\nfor his children, his son, M. Alfred Werlé, having married the daughter\r\nof the Duc de Montebello, while his daughter espoused the son of M.\r\nMagne, Minister of Finance under the Second Empire.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEADS OF PH[OE]BUS AND BACCHUS.]\r\n\r\nHalf-way down the narrow Rue du Temple is an ancient gateway, on\r\nwhich may be traced the half-effaced sculptured heads of Ph[oe]bus\r\nand Bacchus. Immediately in front is a green _porte-cochère_ forming\r\nthe entrance to the Clicquot-Werlé establishment, and conducting to\r\na spacious trim-kept courtyard, set off with a few trees, with some\r\nextensive stabling and cart-sheds on the left, and on the right hand\r\nthe entrance to the cellars. Facing us is an unpretending-looking\r\nedifice, where the firm has its counting-houses, with a little corner\r\ntower surmounted by a characteristic weathercock consisting of a figure\r\nof Bacchus seated astride a cask beneath a vine-branch, and holding\r\nup a bottle in one hand and a goblet in the other. The old Remois\r\nCommanderie of the Knights Templars existed until the epoch of the\r\nGreat Revolution, and today a few fragments of the ancient buildings\r\nremain adjacent to the 'celliers' of the establishment, which are\r\nreached through a pair of folding-doors and down a flight of stone\r\nsteps. The date of the foundation of this Commanderie is uncertain,\r\nbut it is known that a Templar's church occupied a portion of the\r\nsite in 1170. In 1311 both the church and the Commanderie passed into\r\npossession of the Order of St. John of Jerusalem, which held them until\r\nthe epoch of the Revolution. Formerly the _échevins_ of Reims used to\r\nbe elected in the ancient hall of the Commanderie, which at one period\r\nwas a sanctuary for debtors, and also for criminals. Early in the\r\npresent century the buildings were sold and demolished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CLICQUOT-WERLÉ ESTABLISHMENT AT REIMS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: Arms of the Dauphins of France.\r\n\r\nArms of the Knight of Malta.\r\n\r\nDEVICES FROM THE COMMANDERIE AT REIMS.]\r\n\r\nAfter being furnished with lighted candles, we set out on our tour of\r\ninspection of the Clicquot-Werlé establishment, entering first of all\r\nthe vast cellar of St. Paul, where the thousands of bottles requiring\r\nto be daily shaken are reposing necks downward on the large perforated\r\ntables which crowd the apartment. It is a peculiarity that each of the\r\nClicquot-Werlé cellars--forty-five in number, and the smallest among\r\nthem a vast apartment--has its special name. In the adjoining cellar of\r\nSt. Matthew other bottles are similarly arranged, and here wine in cask\r\nis likewise stored. We pass rows of huge tuns, each holding its twelve\r\nor thirteen hundred gallons of fine reserved wine designed for blending\r\nwith more youthful growths; next, are threading our way between\r\nseemingly endless piles of hogsheads filled with later vintages, and\r\nanon are passing smaller casks containing the syrup with which the\r\n_vin préparé_ is dosed. At intervals we come upon some square opening\r\nin the floor through which bottles of wine are being hauled up from\r\nthe cellars beneath in readiness to receive their requisite adornment\r\nbefore being packed in baskets or cases, according to the country\r\nto which they are destined to be despatched. To Russia the Clicquot\r\nChampagne is sent in cases containing sixty bottles, while the cases\r\nfor China contain as many as double that number.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: REMAINS OF THE COMMANDERIE AT REIMS.]\r\n\r\nThe ample cellarage which the house possesses has enabled M. Werlé to\r\nmake many experiments which firms with less space at their command\r\nwould find it difficult to carry out on the same satisfactory scale.\r\nSuch, for instance, is the system of racks in which the bottles repose\r\nwhile the wine undergoes its diurnal shaking. Instead of these racks\r\nbeing, as is commonly the case, at almost upright angles, they are\r\nperfectly horizontal, which, in M. Werlé's opinion, offers a material\r\nadvantage, inasmuch as the bottles are all in readiness for disgorging\r\nat the same time, instead of the lower ones being ready before those\r\nabove, as is the case when the ancient system is followed, owing to the\r\nuppermost bottles getting less shaken than the others.\r\n\r\nAfter performing the round of the celliers we descend into the _caves_,\r\na complete labyrinth of gloomy underground corridors excavated in the\r\nbed of chalk which underlies the city, and roofed and walled with solid\r\nmasonry, more or less blackened by age. In one of these cellars we\r\ncatch sight of rows of workpeople engaged in the operation of dosing,\r\ncorking, securing, and shaking the bottles of wine which have just\r\nleft the hands of the _dégorgeur_ by the dim light of half-a-dozen\r\ntallow-candles. The latest invention for liqueuring the wine is being\r\nemployed. Formerly, to prevent the carbonic acid gas escaping from the\r\nbottles while the process of liqueuring was going on, it was necessary\r\nto press a gutta-percha ball connected with the machine, in order to\r\nforce the escaping gas back. The new machine, however, renders this\r\nunnecessary, the gas, by its own power and composition, forcing itself\r\nback into the wine.\r\n\r\nIn the adjoining cellar of St. Charles are stacks of bottles awaiting\r\nthe manipulation of the _dégorgeur_; while in that of St. Ferdinand\r\nmen are engaged in examining other bottles before lighted candles, to\r\nmake certain that the sediment is thoroughly dislodged, and the wine\r\nperfectly clear before the disgorgement is effected. Here, too, the\r\ncorking, wiring, and stringing of the newly-disgorged wine are going\r\non. Another flight of steps leads to the second tier of cellars, where\r\nthe moisture trickles down the dank dingy walls, and save the dim\r\nlight thrown out by the candles we carried, and by some other far-off\r\nflickering taper, stuck in a cleft stick, to direct the workmen, who\r\nwith dexterous turns of their wrists, give a twist to the bottles, all\r\nis darkness. On every side bottles are reposing in various attitudes,\r\nthe majority in huge square piles on their sides, others in racks\r\nslightly tilted; others, again, almost standing on their heads, while\r\nsome, which through overinflation have come to grief, litter the floor\r\nand crunch beneath our feet. Tablets are hung against each stack\r\nof wine indicating its age, and from time to time a bottle is held\r\nup before the light to show us how the sediment commences to form,\r\nor to explain how it eventually works its way down the neck of the\r\nbottle, and finally settles on the cork. Suddenly we are startled by\r\na loud report, resembling a pistol-shot, which reverberates through\r\nthe vaulted chamber, as a bottle close at hand explodes, dashing out\r\nits heavy bottom as neatly as though it had been cut by a diamond,\r\nand dislocating the necks and pounding-in the sides of its immediate\r\nneighbours. The wine trickles down, and eventually finds its way along\r\nthe sloping sides of the slippery floor to the narrow gutter in the\r\ncentre.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MADAME VEUVE CLICQUOT AT EIGHTY YEARS OF AGE\r\n\r\n(From the painting by Léon Coignet).]\r\n\r\nVentilating shafts pass from one tier of cellars to the other, enabling\r\nthe temperature in a certain measure to be regulated, and thereby\r\nobviate an excess of breakage. M. Werlé estimates that the loss in\r\nthis respect during the first eighteen months of a cuvée amounts to 7\r\nper cent, but subsequently is considerably less. In 1862 one Champagne\r\nmanufacturer lost as much as 45 per cent of his wine by breakages. The\r\nClicquot cuvée is made in the cave of St. William, where 120 hogsheads\r\nof wine are hauled up by means of a crane, and discharged into the vat\r\ndaily as long as the operation lasts. The tirage, or bottling of the\r\nwine, ordinarily commences in the middle of May, and occupies fully a\r\nmonth.\r\n\r\nM. Werlé's private residence is close to the establishment in the Rue\r\ndu Temple, and here he has collected a small gallery of high-class\r\nmodern paintings by French and other artists, including Meissonier's\r\n'Card-players,' Delaroche's 'Beatrice Cenci on her way to Execution,'\r\nFleury's 'Charles V. picking up the brush of Titian,' various works by\r\nthe brothers Scheffer, Knaus's highly-characteristic _genre_ picture,\r\n'His Highness on a Journey,' and several fine portraits, among which is\r\none of Madame Clicquot, painted by Léon Coignet, when she was eighty\r\nyears of age, and another of M. Werlé by the same artist, regarded as\r\na _chef-d'[oe]uvre_. Before her father's death Madame Clicquot used\r\nto reside in the Rue de Marc, some short distance from the cellars in\r\nwhich her whole existence centred, in a handsome Renaissance house,\r\nsaid to have had some connection with the row of palaces that at one\r\ntime lined the neighbouring and then fashionable Rue du Tambour.\r\nThis, however, is extremely doubtful. A number of interesting and\r\nwell-preserved bas-reliefs decorate one of the façades of the house\r\nlooking on to the court. The figures are of the period of François\r\nPremier and his son Henri II., who inaugurated his reign with a\r\ncomforting edict for the Protestants, ordaining that blasphemers were\r\nto have their tongues pierced with red-hot irons, and heretics to be\r\nburnt alive, and who had the ill-luck to lose his eye and life through\r\na lance-thrust of the Comte de Montgomerie, captain of his Scotch\r\nguards, whilst jousting with him at a tournament held in honour of the\r\nmarriage of his daughter Isabelle with the gloomy widower of Queen Mary\r\nof England, of sanguinary fame.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe first of these bas-reliefs represents two soldiers of the Swiss\r\nguard, the next a Turk and Slav tilting at each other, and then\r\ncomes a scroll entwined round a thistle, and inscribed with this\r\nenigmatical motto: 'Giane le sur ou rien.' In the third bas-relief a\r\ncouple of passionate Italians are winding up a gambling dispute with a\r\nhand-to-hand combat, in the course of which table and cards have got\r\ncanted over; the fourth presents us with two French knights, armed\r\n_cap-à-pie_, engaged in a tourney; while in the fifth and last a couple\r\nof German lansquenets essay their gladiatorial skill with their long\r\nand dangerous weapons. Several years back a tablet was discovered in\r\none of the cellars of the house, inscribed 'Ci-gist vénérable religieux\r\nmaistre Pierre Derclé, docteur en théologie, jadis prieur de céans.\r\nPriez Dieu pour luy. 1486,' which would almost indicate that the house\r\nhad originally a religious character, although the warlike spirit of\r\nthe bas-reliefs decorating it renders any such supposition with regard\r\nto the existing building untenable. We should mention that the spaces\r\nabove the _porte cochère_, and the window by its side, are occupied\r\nby four medallions, which present that curious mingling of classic\r\nand contemporary styles for which the epoch of the Renaissance was\r\nremarkable.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MEDALLIONS FROM MADAME CLICQUOT'S HOUSE.]\r\n\r\nThe Messrs. Werlé own numerous acres of vineyards, comprising the very\r\nfinest situations in the well-known districts of Verzenay, Bouzy, Le\r\nMesnil, and Oger, at all of which places they have vendangeoirs or\r\npressing-houses of their own. Their establishment at Verzenay contains\r\nseven presses, that at Bouzy eight, at Le Mesnil six, and at Oger two,\r\nin addition to which grapes are pressed under their own supervision at\r\nAy, Avize, and Cramant, in vendangeoirs belonging to their friends.\r\n\r\nSince the death of Madame Clicquot the legal style of the firm has\r\nbeen 'Werlé & Co., successors to Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin,' the\r\nmark, of which M. Werlé and his son are the sole proprietors, still\r\nremaining 'Veuve Clicquot-Ponsardin,' while the corks of the bottles\r\nare branded with the words 'V. Clicquot-P. Werlé,' encircling the\r\nfigure of a comet. The style of the wine--light, delicate, elegant, and\r\nfragrant--is familiar to all connoisseurs of Champagne. What, however,\r\nis not equally well known is that within the last few years the firm,\r\nin obedience to the prevailing taste, have introduced a perfectly dry\r\nwine of corresponding quality to the richer wine which made the fortune\r\nof the house, and gave enduring fame to the Clicquot brand.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PLACE ROYALE AT REIMS.]\r\n\r\n                                 VII.\r\n\r\n        /Reims and its Champagne Establishments/ _(continued)_.\r\n\r\n    The house of Louis Roederer founded by a plodding German\r\n    named Schreider--The central and other establishments of the\r\n    firm--Ancient house in the Rue des Elus--The gloomy-looking Rue\r\n    des Deux Anges and prison-like aspect of its houses--Inside\r\n    their courts the scene changes--Handsome Renaissance house and\r\n    garden, a former abode of the canons of the Cathedral--The\r\n    Place Royale--The Hôtel des Fermes and the statue of the 'wise,\r\n    virtuous, and magnanimous Louis XV.'--Birthplace of Colbert in\r\n    the Rue de Cérès--Quaint Adam and Eve gateway in the Rue de\r\n    l'Arbalète--Heidsieck & Co.'s central establishment in the Rue de\r\n    Sedan--Their famous 'Monopole' brand--The firm founded in the last\r\n    century--Their extensive cellars inside and outside Reims--The\r\n    matured wines shipped by them--The Boulevard du Temple--M.

It next opened up\r\nthe United States, and finally introduced its brand into England. The\r\nhouse possesses cellars in various parts of Reims, and has its offices\r\nin one of the oldest quarters of the city--namely, the Rue des Elus, or\r\nancient Rue des Juifs, where the old synagogue formerly stood, and the\r\nrecords of which date as far back as 1103.\r\n\r\nAt the corner of this street, and abutting on the Place des Marchés,\r\nis a curious old house, the overhanging upper stories of which are\r\nsupported by huge massive carved brackets, decorated with figures\r\nmore or less quaint in design. M. Louis Roederer's offices in the\r\nRue des Elus are at the farther end of a courtyard, beyond which is\r\nfound a second court, where carts laden with cases of Champagne seem\r\nto indicate that some portion of the shipping business of the house\r\nis here carried on. Several requests made by us for permission to\r\nvisit M. Louis Roederer's establishments having been refused, it is\r\nonly of their external appearance that we are competent to speak. One\r\nof them, in the Boulevard du Temple, is distinguished by a rather\r\nimposing façade, and has a carved head of Bacchus surmounting its\r\n_porte-cochère_; while the principal establishment, a picturesque range\r\nof buildings of considerable extent, is situated in the neighbouring\r\nRue de la Justice.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD HOUSE AT THE CORNER OF THE RUE DES ÉLUS AND THE\r\nPLACE DES MARCHÉS, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nLeading from the Rue des Elus into the Rue de Vesle is a gloomy-looking\r\nancient street known as the Rue des Deux Anges, all the houses of which\r\nhave their windows secured by iron gratings, and their massive doors\r\nthickly studded with huge nails. These prison-like façades, which in\r\nall probability refer to the epoch of the religious wars, succeed each\r\nother in lugubrious monotony along either side of the way; but gain\r\nadmittance to their inner courts, and quite a different scene presents\r\nitself. In one notable instance, looking on to a pleasant little\r\nflower-garden, we found a small but charming Renaissance house, with\r\nits windows ornamented with elaborate mouldings, and surmounted by\r\ngraceful sculptured heads, while at one corner there rose up a tower\r\nwith a sun-dial displayed on its front. In this and in an adjoining\r\nhouse the canons of the cathedral were accustomed to reside in the days\r\nwhen something like four-fifths of the city were the property of the\r\nChurch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RENAISSANCE HOUSE IN THE RUE DES DEUX ANGES, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nProceeding along the Rue de Vesle and the neighbouring Rue des\r\nTapissiers, we find ourselves once more in the Place Royale, the\r\nprincipal side of which is occupied by the once notable Hôtel des\r\nFermes, where, in the days of the _ancien régime_, the farmers-general\r\nof the Champagne were accustomed to receive the revenues of the\r\nprovince. A bronze statue rises in the centre of the Place, which\r\nfrom its Roman costume and martial bearing might be taken for some\r\nhero of antiquity, did not the inscription on the pedestal apprise us\r\nthat it is intended for the 'wise, virtuous, and magnanimous Louis\r\nXV.,' a misuse of terms which has caused a Transatlantic Republican\r\nto characterise the monument as a brazen lie. Leading out of the\r\nPlace Royale is the Rue de Cérès, in which there is a modernised\r\nsixteenth-century house claiming to be the birthplace, on the 29th\r\nAugust 1619, of Jean Baptiste Colbert, son of a Reims wool-merchant,\r\nand the famous minister who did so much to consolidate the finances of\r\nthe State which the royal voluptuary, masquerading at Reims in Roman\r\ngarb, afterwards made such dreadful havoc of.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEADS SURMOUNTING THE PRINCIPAL WINDOWS OF THE\r\nRENAISSANCE HOUSE IN THE RUE DES DEUX ANGES.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEAN BAPTISTE COLBERT\r\n\r\n(From a portrait of the time).]\r\n\r\nWe again cross the Place des Marchés, at the farther end of which, on\r\nthe left-hand side, is the Rue de l'Arbalète, notable for a curious\r\nRenaissance gateway, with its pediment supported by two life-size\r\nfigures, which the Rémois, for no very sufficient reason, have\r\npopularly christened Adam and Eve. Beyond the Place des Marchés and\r\nthe Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, and at no great distance from the\r\nClicquot-Werlé establishment, is the narrow winding Rue de Sedan,\r\nwhere the old-established firm of Heidsieck & Co., which has secured a\r\nhigh-class reputation in both eastern and western hemispheres for its\r\nfamous Monopole and Dry Monopole brands, has its central offices. The\r\noriginal firm dates back to 1785, when France was struggling with those\r\nfinancial difficulties that a few years later culminated in that great\r\nsocial upheaving which kept Europe in a state of turmoil for more than\r\na quarter of a century. Among the archives of the firm is a patent,\r\nbearing the signature of the Minister of the Prussian Royal Household,\r\nappointing Heidsieck & Co. purveyors of Champagne to Frederick William\r\nIII. The Champagne-drinking Hohenzollern _par excellence_, however,\r\nwas the son and successor of the preceding, who, from habitual\r\nover-indulgence in the exhilarating sparkling beverage during the last\r\nfew years of his reign, acquired the _sobriquet_ of King Clicquot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ADAM AND EVE GATEWAY, RUE DE L'ARBALÈTE, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nOn passing through the large _porte-cochère_ giving entrance to\r\nMessrs. Heidsieck's principal establishment, one finds oneself in a\r\nsmall courtyard, with the surrounding buildings overgrown with ivy\r\nand venerable vines. On the left is a dwelling-house enriched with\r\nelaborate mouldings and cornices, and at the farther end of the court\r\nis the entrance to the cellars, surmounted by a sun-dial bearing\r\nthe date 1829. The latter, however, is no criterion of the age of\r\nthe buildings themselves, as these were occupied by the firm at its\r\nfoundation, towards the close of the last century. We are first\r\nconducted into an antiquated-looking low cellier, the roof of which\r\nis sustained with rude timber supports, and here bottles of wine are\r\nbeing labelled and packed, although this is but a mere adjunct to the\r\nadjacent spacious packing-room, provided with its loading platform\r\nand communicating directly with the public road. At the time of our\r\nvisit this hall was gaily decorated with flags and inscriptions, the\r\nday before having been the fête of St. Jean, when the firm entertain\r\nthe people in their employ with a banquet and a ball, at which the\r\nchoicest wine of the house liberally flows. From the packing-room we\r\ndescend into the cellars, which, like all the more ancient vaults in\r\nReims, have been constructed on no regular plan. Here we thread our\r\nway between piles after piles of bottles, many of which, having passed\r\nthrough the hands of the disgorger, are awaiting their customary\r\nadornment. The lower tier of cellars is mostly stored with _vin sur\r\npointe_, and bottles with their necks downward are encountered in\r\nendless monotony along a score or more of long galleries. The only\r\nvariation in our lengthened promenade is when we come upon some\r\nsolitary workman engaged in his monotonous task of shaking his 30,000\r\nor 40,000 bottles per diem.\r\n\r\nThe disgorging at Messrs. Heidsieck's takes place, in accordance with\r\nthe good old rule, in the cellars underground, where we noticed large\r\nstocks of wine three and five years old, the former in the first stage\r\nof _sur pointe_, and the latter awaiting shipment. It is a specialty of\r\nthe house to ship only matured wine, which is necessarily of a higher\r\ncharacter than the ordinary youthful growths, for a few years have a\r\nwonderful influence in developing the finer qualities of Champagne. At\r\nthe time of our visit, in the spring of 1877, when the English market\r\nwas being glutted with the crude full-bodied wine of 1874, Messrs.\r\nHeidsieck were continuing to ship wines of 1870 and 1872, beautifully\r\nrounded by keeping, and of fine flavour and great delicacy of perfume.\r\nOf these thoroughly matured wines the firm had fully a year's\r\nconsumption on hand.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Heidsieck & Co. have a handsome modern establishment in the Rue\r\nCoquebert--a comparatively new quarter of the city, where Champagne\r\nestablishments are the rule--the courtyard of which, alive with workmen\r\nat the time of our visit, is broad and spacious, while the surrounding\r\nbuildings are light and airy, and the cellars lofty, regular, and well\r\nventilated. In a large cellier here, where the tuns are ranged side\r\nby side between the rows of iron columns supporting the roof, the\r\nfirm make their cuvée. Here, too, the bottling of their wine takes\r\nplace, and considerable stocks of high-class reserve wines and more\r\nyouthful growths are stored ready for removal when required by the\r\ncentral establishment. The bulk of Messrs. Heidsieck's reserve wines,\r\nhowever, repose in the outskirts of Reims, near the Porte Dieu-Lumière,\r\nin one of the numerous abandoned chalk quarries, which of late years\r\nthe Champagne manufacturers have discovered are capable of being\r\ntransformed into admirable cellars.\r\n\r\nIn addition to shipping a rich and a dry variety of the Monopole\r\nbrand, of which they are sole proprietors, Messrs. Heidsieck export\r\nto this country a rich and a dry Grand Vin Royal. It is, however, to\r\ntheir famous Monopole wine, and especially to the dry variety, which\r\nmust necessarily comprise the finest growths, that the firm owe their\r\nprincipal celebrity.\r\n\r\nFew large manufacturing towns like Reims--which is one of the most\r\nimportant of those engaged in the woollen manufacture in France--can\r\nboast of such fine promenades and such handsome boulevards as the\r\ncapital of the Champagne. As the ancient fortifications of the city\r\nwere from time to time razed, their site was levelled and generally\r\nplanted with trees, so that the older quarters of Reims are almost\r\nencircled by broad and handsome thoroughfares, separating the city, as\r\nit were, from its outlying suburbs. In or close to the broad Boulevard\r\ndu Temple, which takes its name from its proximity to the site of the\r\nancient Commanderie of the Templars, various Champagne manufacturers,\r\nincluding M. Louis Roederer, M. Ernest Irroy, and M. Charles\r\nHeidsieck, have their establishments; while but a few paces off, in\r\nthe neighbouring Rue Coquebert, are the large and handsome premises of\r\nMessrs. Krug & Co.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. ERNEST IRROY'S ESTABLISHMENT AT REIMS.]\r\n\r\nThe offices of M. Ernest Irroy, who is known in Reims not merely as\r\na large Champagne grower and shipper, but also as a distinguished\r\namateur of the fine arts, taking a leading part in originating local\r\nexhibitions and the like, are attached to his private residence,\r\na handsome mansion flanked by a large and charming garden in the\r\nBoulevard du Temple. The laying out of this sylvan oasis is due to\r\nM. Varé, the head gardener of the city of Paris, who contributed so\r\nlargely to the picturesque embellishment of the Bois de Boulogne.\r\nM. Irroy's establishment, which comprises a considerable range of\r\nbuildings grouped around two courtyards, is immediately adjacent,\r\nalthough its principal entrance is in the Rue de la Justice. The vast\r\ncelliers, covering an area of upwards of 3000 square yards, and either\r\nstocked with wine in cask or used for packing and similar purposes,\r\nafford the requisite space for carrying on a most extensive business.\r\nThe cellars beneath comprise three stories, two of which are solidly\r\nroofed and lined with masonry, while the lowermost one is excavated in\r\nthe chalk. They are admirably constructed on a symmetrical plan, and\r\ntheir total surface is very little short of 7000 square yards. Spite of\r\nthe great depth to which these cellars descend, they are perfectly dry,\r\nthe ventilation is good, and their temperature moreover is remarkably\r\ncool, one result of which is that M. Irroy's loss from breakage never\r\nexceeds four per cent per annum. M. Irroy holds a high position as a\r\nvineyard proprietor in the Champagne, his vines covering an area of\r\nnearly ninety acres. At Mareuil and Avenay he owns some twenty-five\r\nacres, at Verzenay and Verzy about fifteen, and at Ambonnay and Bouzy\r\nclose upon fifty acres. His father and his uncle, whose properties he\r\ninherited or purchased, commenced some thirty years ago to plant vines\r\non certain slopes of Bouzy possessing a southern aspect, and he has\r\nfollowed their example with such success both at Bouzy and Ambonnay,\r\nthat the Reims Agricultural Association in 1873 conferred upon him a\r\nsilver-gilt medal for his plantations of vines, and in 1880 presented\r\nhim with a _coupe d'honneur_. M. Irroy owns vendangeoirs at Verzenay,\r\nAvenay, and Ambonnay; and at Bouzy, where his largest vineyards are,\r\nhe has built some excellent cottages for his labourers. He has also\r\nconstructed a substantial bridge over the ravine which, formed by\r\nwinter torrents from the hills, intersects the principal vineyard\r\nslopes of Bouzy.\r\n\r\nM. Ernest Irroy's wines, prepared with scrupulous care and rare\r\nintelligence, have been known in England for some years past, and are\r\nsteadily increasing in popularity. They are emphatically connoisseurs'\r\nwines. The best West-end clubs, such as White's, Arthur's, the old\r\nCarlton, and the like, lay down the cuvées of this house in good years\r\nas they lay down their vintage ports and finer clarets, and drink them,\r\nnot in a crude state, but when they are in perfection--that is, in five\r\nto ten years' time. M. Irroy exports to the British colonies and to the\r\nUnited States the same fine wines which he ships to England.\r\n\r\nSeveral well-known Champagne firms have their establishments in this\r\nquarter of Reims. In addition to those already mentioned, we may\r\ninstance G. H. Mumm & Co., who are located in the Rue Andrieux, only\r\na short distance from the grand triumphal arch known as the Gate of\r\nMars, by far the most important Roman remain of which the Champagne\r\ncan boast. Within a stone's throw of this arch there formerly stood\r\nthe ancient château of the Archbishops of Reims, demolished close\r\nupon three centuries ago. In the Rue de Mars, a winding ill-paved\r\nthoroughfare leading from the Gate of Mars to the Place de l'Hôtel\r\nde Ville, Jules Mumm & Co., an offshoot from the once famous firm\r\nof P. A. Mumm & Co., are installed; while in a massive and somewhat\r\npretentious-looking house, dating back to the time of Louis Quatorze,\r\nin a corner of the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville, Ruinart Père et Fils,\r\nwho claim to rank as the oldest existing Champagne establishment, have\r\ntheir offices. The late Vicomte de Brimont, the recent head of the\r\nfirm, was a collateral descendant of the Dom Ruinart, whose remains\r\nrepose nigh to those of the illustrious Dom Perignon in the abbey\r\nchurch of Hautvillers. From the Place de l'Hôtel de Ville we proceed\r\nthrough the narrow Rue du Tambour, originally a Roman thoroughfare,\r\nand during the Middle Ages the locality where the nobility of Reims\r\nprincipally had their abodes. Half-way up this street stands the famous\r\nHouse of the Musicians, one of the most interesting architectural\r\nrelics of which the capital of the Champagne can boast. It evidently\r\ndates from the early part of the fourteenth century, but by whom it was\r\nerected is unknown. Some ascribe it to the Knights Templars, others\r\nto the Counts of Champagne, while others suppose it to have been the\r\nresidence of the famous Counts de la Marck, who in later times diverged\r\ninto three separate branches, the first furnishing Dukes of Cleves and\r\nJülich to Germany, and Dukes of Nevers and Counts of Eu to France;\r\nwhile the second became Dukes of Bouillon and Princes of Sedan, titles\r\nwhich passed to the Turennes when Henri de la Tour d'Auvergne, Vicomte\r\nde Turenne, married the surviving heiress of the house. The third\r\nbranch comprised the Barons of Lumain, allied to the Hohenzollerns.\r\nTheir most famous member slew Louis de Bourbon, Archbishop of Liège,\r\nand flung his body into the Meuse; and subsequently became celebrated\r\nas the Wild Boar of the Ardennes, of whom all readers of _Quentin\r\nDurward_ will retain a lively recollection.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE HOUSE OF THE MUSICIANS IN THE RUE DU TAMBOUR, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nTo return, however, to the House of the Musicians. A probable\r\nconjecture ascribes the origin of the quaint mediæval structure to\r\nthe Brotherhood of Minstrels of Reims, who in the thirteenth century\r\nenjoyed a considerable reputation, not merely in the Champagne, but\r\nthroughout the North of France. The house takes its present name from\r\nfive seated statues of musicians, larger than life-size, occupying\r\nthe Gothic niches between the first-floor windows, and resting upon\r\nbrackets ornamented with grotesque heads. It is thought that the\r\npartially-damaged figure on the left-hand side was originally playing\r\na drum and a species of clarionet. The next one evidently has the\r\nremnants of a harp in his raised hands. The third or central figure\r\nis supposed merely to have held a hawk upon his wrist; whilst the\r\nfourth seeks to extract harmony from a dilapidated bagpipe; and the\r\nfifth, with crossed legs, strums complacently away upon the fiddle. The\r\nground-floor of the quaint old tenement is to-day an oil and colour\r\nshop, the front of which is covered with chequers in all the tints of\r\nthe rainbow.\r\n\r\nLeading from the Rue du Tambour is the Rue de la Belle Image, thus\r\nnamed from a handsome statuette of the Virgin, which formerly decorated\r\na corner niche; and beyond is the Rue St. Hilaire, where Messrs.\r\nBarnett et Fils, trading under the designation of Périnet et Fils, and\r\nthe only English house engaged in the manufacture of Champagne, have\r\nan establishment which is certainly as perfect as any to be found in\r\nReims. Above-ground are several large store-rooms, where vintage-casks\r\nand the various utensils common to a Champagne establishment are kept;\r\nand a capacious cellier, upwards of one hundred and fifty feet in\r\nlength, with its roof resting on massive timber supports. Here new wine\r\nis stored preparatory to being blended and bottled; and in the huge\r\ntun, holding nearly three thousand gallons, standing at the further\r\nend, the firm make their cuvée; while adjacent is a room where stocks\r\nof corks and labels, metal foil, and the like are kept.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MESSRS. PÉRINET ET FILS' ESTABLISHMENT IN THE RUE ST.\r\nHILAIRE, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nUnderneath this building there are three stories of cellars--an\r\nexceedingly rare thing anywhere in the Champagne--all constructed\r\nin solid masonry on a uniform plan, each story comprising two wide\r\ngalleries, running parallel with each other and connected by means of\r\ntransverse passages. Spite of the great depth to which these cellars\r\ndescend, they are perfectly dry; the ventilation, too, is excellent;\r\nand their different temperatures render them especially suitable for\r\nthe storage of Champagne, the temperature of the lowest cellar being 6°\r\nCentigrade (43° Fahrenheit), or one degree Centigrade below the cellar\r\nimmediately above, which in its turn is two degrees below the uppermost\r\nof all. The advantage of this is that, when the wine develops an excess\r\nof effervescence, any undue proportion of breakages can be checked by\r\nremoving the bottles to a lower cellar, and consequently into a lower\r\ntemperature.\r\n\r\nThe first cellars we enter are closely stacked with wine in bottle,\r\nwhich is gradually clearing itself by the formation of a deposit; while\r\nin an adjoining cellar on the same level the operations of disgorging,\r\nliqueuring, and corking are going on. At the end of this gallery is a\r\nspacious compartment, where a large stock of _pure Champagne_ cognac\r\nof grand vintages is stored for cask and liqueur use. In the cellars\r\nimmediately beneath, bottles of wine repose in solid stacks ready for\r\nthe _dégorgeur_; while others rest in racks, in order that they may\r\nundergo their daily shaking. In the lowest cellars reserved wine in\r\ncask is stored, as it best retains its natural freshness and purity\r\nin a very cool place. All air is carefully excluded from the casks;\r\nany ullage is immediately replaced; and, as evaporation is continually\r\ngoing on, the casks are examined every fortnight, when any deficiency\r\nis at once replenished. At Messrs. Périnet et Fils', as at all the\r\nfirst-class establishments, the _vin brut_ is a _mélange_ comprising\r\nthe produce of some of the best vineyards, and has every possible\r\nattention paid to it during its progressive stages of development.\r\n\r\nFrom the second tier of cellars at Messrs. Périnet et Fils' a gallery\r\nextends, under the Rue St. Hilaire, to some extensive vaults excavated\r\nbeneath an adjacent building, in which the Reims Military Club is\r\ninstalled. These vaults, arranged in two separate stories, are eight\r\nin number, and in them we found a quarter of a million bottles of\r\n_vin brut_, reposing either in solid stacks or _sur pointe_, the\r\nlatter going through their daily shaking in order to fit them for the\r\noperation of _dégorgement_. On the whole the cellars of Périnet et\r\nFils, including the six long galleries already described, suffice for\r\nthe storage of a million bottles of Champagne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CELLIER AND CELLARS OF MESSRS. PÉRINET ET FILS.]\r\n\r\nBefore leaving the establishment Champagnes of different years were\r\nshown to us, all of them soft, light, and delicate, and with that fine\r\nflavour and full perfume which the best growths of the Marne alone\r\nexhibit. Among several curiosities submitted to us was a still Verzenay\r\nof the year 1857, one of the most delicate wines it was ever our\r\nfortune to taste. Light in body, rich in colour, of a singularly novel\r\nand refined flavour, and with a magnificent yet indefinable bouquet,\r\nthe wine was in every respect perfect. Not only was the year of the\r\nvintage a grand one, but the wine must have been made with the greatest\r\npossible care, and from the most perfect grapes, for so delicate a\r\ngrowth to have retained its flavour in such perfection, and preserved\r\nits brilliant ruby colour for such a length of time.\r\n\r\nFrom the samples shown to us of Périnet et Fils' Champagne, we\r\nwere prepared to find that at some recent tastings in London, the\r\nparticulars of which have been made public, their Extra Sec took the\r\nfirst place at each of the three severe competitions to which it was\r\nsubjected.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GROTTO BENEATH THE OLD FORTIFICATIONS OF REIMS.]\r\n\r\n                                 VIII.\r\n\r\n        /Reims and its Champagne Establishments/ _(continued)_.\r\n\r\n    La Prison de Bonne Semaine--Mary Queen of Scots at Reims--Messrs.\r\n    Pommery & Greno's offices--A fine collection of faïence--The Rue\r\n    des Anglais a former refuge of English Catholics--Remains of the\r\n    old University of Reims--Ancient tower and grotto--The handsome\r\n    castellated Pommery establishment--The spacious cellier and\r\n    huge carved cuvée tuns--The descent to the cellars--Their great\r\n    extent--These lofty subterranean chambers originally quarries,\r\n    and subsequently places of refuge of the early Christians and\r\n    the Protestants--Madame Pommery's splendid cuvées of 1868 and\r\n    1874--Messrs. de St. Marceaux & Co.'s new establishment in the\r\n    Avenue de Sillery--Its garden-court and circular shaft--Animated\r\n    scene in the large packing hall--Lowering bottled wine to the\r\n    cellars--Great depth and extent of these cellars--Messrs. de\r\n    St. Marceaux & Co.'s various wines--The establishment of Veuve\r\n    Morelle & Co., successors to Max Sutaine--The latter's 'Essai sur\r\n    le Vin de Champagne'--The Sutaine family formerly of some note at\r\n    Reims--Morelle & Co.'s cellars well adapted to the development\r\n    of sparkling wines--The various brands of the house--The Porte\r\n    Dieu-Lumière.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HEAD OVERSEER AT POMMERY AND GRENO'S.]\r\n\r\n\r\nNigh the cathedral of Reims, and in the rear of the archiepiscopal\r\npalace, there runs a short narrow street known as the Rue Vauthier le\r\nNoir, and frequently mentioned in old works relating to the present\r\ncapital of the Champagne. The discovery of various pillars and\r\nstatues, together with a handsome Gallo-Roman altar, whilst digging\r\nsome foundations in 1837, points to the fact that a Pagan temple\r\nformerly occupied the site. The street is supposed to have taken its\r\nname, however, from some celebrated gaoler, for in mediæval times\r\nhere stood 'la prison de bonne semaine.' On the site of this prison\r\na château was subsequently built, which tradition has erroneously\r\nfixed upon as the residence of the beautiful and luckless Mary Queen\r\nof Scots, in the days when her uncle, Cardinal Charles de Lorraine,\r\nwas Lord Archbishop of Reims. Temple, prison, and palace have alike\r\ndisappeared, and where they stood there now rises midway between\r\ncourt and garden a handsome mansion, the residence of Madame Pommery,\r\nhead of the well-known firm of Pommery & Greno. To the left of the\r\ncourtyard, which is entered through a monumental gateway, are some\r\nold buildings, let into the walls of which are a couple of sculptured\r\nescutcheons, the one comprising the arms of France, and the other those\r\nof the Cardinal de Lorraine. On the right-hand side of the courtyard\r\nare the Pommery offices, together with the manager's sanctum, replete\r\nwith artistic curiosities, the walls being completely covered with\r\nremarkable specimens of faïence, including Rouen, Gien, Palissy, Delft,\r\nand majolica, collected in the majority of instances by Madame Pommery\r\nin the villages around Reims. Here we were received by M. Vasnier, who\r\nat once volunteered to accompany us to the cellars of the firm outside\r\nthe city. Messrs. Pommery & Greno originally carried on business in\r\nthe Rue Vauthier le Noir, where there are extensive cellars, but their\r\nrapidly-increasing connection long since compelled them to emigrate\r\nbeyond the walls of Reims.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD COATS OF ARMS IN THE COURTYARD OF MADAME POMMERY'S\r\nRESIDENCE.]\r\n\r\nIn close proximity to the Rue Vauthier le Noir is the Rue des Anglais,\r\nso named from the English Catholic refugees, who, flying from the\r\npersecutions of our so-called Good Queen Bess, here took up their\r\nabode and established a college and a seminary. They rapidly acquired\r\ngreat influence in Reims, and one of their number, William Gifford,\r\nwas even elected archbishop. At the end of this street, nigh to Madame\r\nPommery's, there stands an old house erected late in the fifteenth\r\ncentury, with a corner tower and rather handsome Renaissance window,\r\nwhich formerly belonged to some of the clergy of the cathedral, and\r\nsubsequently became the 'Bureau Général de la Loterie de France,' an\r\ninstitution abolished by the National Convention in 1793.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD HOUSE IN THE RUE DES ANGLAIS, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nThe Rue des Anglais conducts into the Rue de l'Université, where a few\r\nremnants of the old University, founded by Cardinal Charles de Lorraine\r\n(1538-74), formerly attracted attention, notably a conical-capped\r\ncorner tower, the sculptured ornaments at the base of which had\r\ncrumbled into dust beneath the corroding tooth of Time.[423] From the\r\nRue de l'Université our way lies along the Boulevard du Temple to the\r\nPorte Gerbert, about a mile beyond which there rises up the curious\r\ncastellated structure in which the Pommery establishment is installed,\r\nwith its tall towers commanding a view of the whole of Reims and its\r\nenvirons. As we drive up the Avenue Gerbert we espy on the right an\r\nisolated crumbling tower, a remnant of the ancient fortifications of\r\nReims,[424] while close at hand, and under the old city-walls, is a\r\ngrotto, to which an ancient origin is likewise ascribed. In another\r\nminute we reach the open iron gates of Messrs. Pommery's establishment,\r\nflanked by a picturesque porter's lodge; and proceeding up a broad\r\ndrive, we alight under a Gothic portico at the entrance to the spacious\r\nand lofty cellier. Iron girders support the roof of this vast hall,\r\n180 feet in length and 90 feet in width, without the aid of a single\r\ncolumn. At one end is the office and tasting-room, provided with a\r\ntelegraphic apparatus and telephone, by means of which communication\r\nis carried on with the Reims bureaux. Stacked up on every side of\r\nthe cellier, and often in eight tiers when empty, are rows upon\r\nrows of casks, 6000 of which contain wine of the costly vintage of\r\n1880 sufficient for a million and a half bottles of Champagne. The\r\ntemperature of this hall is carefully regulated; the windows are high\r\nup near the roof, and the sun's rays are rigidly excluded, so that a\r\npleasant coolness pervades the building. On the left-hand side stand\r\ntwo huge tuns, with the monogram P. and G., surmounting the arms of\r\nReims, carved on their heads. These are capable of containing 5500\r\ngallons of wine, and in them the firm make their cuvée. A platform,\r\naccess to which is gained by a staircase in a side aisle, runs round\r\none of these _foudres_; and when the wine, which has been hoisted\r\nup in casks and poured through a metal trough into the _foudre_, is\r\nbeing blended, boys stand on this platform and, by means of a handle\r\nprotruding above the cask, work the paddle-wheels placed inside,\r\nthereby securing the complete amalgamation of the wine. Adjoining\r\nare the chains and lifts worked by steam, by means of which wine is\r\nraised and lowered from and to the cellars beneath, one lift raising or\r\nlowering eight casks, whether full or empty, in the space of a minute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE POMMERY AND GRENO ESTABLISHMENT IN THE OUTSKIRTS OF\r\nREIMS.]\r\n\r\nAt the farther end of the hall a Gothic door, decorated with ornamental\r\nironwork, leads to the long broad flight of steps, 116 in number,\r\nand nearly twelve feet in width, conducting to the suite of lofty\r\nsubterranean chambers, where bottles of _vin brut_ repose in their\r\nhundreds of thousands in slanting racks or solid piles, passing\r\nleisurely through those stages of development necessary to fit them\r\nfor the _dégorgeur_. Altogether there are 130 large shafts, 90 feet in\r\ndepth and 60 feet square at their base, which were originally quarries,\r\nand are now connected by spacious galleries. This side of Reims abounds\r\nwith similar chalk quarries, commonly believed to have served as places\r\nof refuge for the Protestants at the time of the League and after the\r\nrevocation of the Edict of Nantes; and it is even conjectured that the\r\nearly Christians--the followers of St. Sixtus and St. Sinicus--here hid\r\nthemselves from their persecutors. Since the cellars within the city\r\nhave no longer sufficed for the storage of the immense stocks required\r\nthrough the development of the Champagne trade, these vast subterranean\r\ngalleries have been successfully utilised by various firms. Messrs.\r\nPommery, after filling up the chambers above the water level, proceeded\r\nto excavate the connecting tunnels, shore up the cracking arches,\r\nand repair the flaws in the chalk with masonry, finally converting\r\nthese abandoned quarries into magnificent cellars for the storage\r\nof Champagne. No less than 60,000_l._ was spent upon them and the\r\ncastellated structure aboveground. Several millions of bottles of\r\nChampagne can be stored in these capacious vaults, the area of which is\r\nnearly 450,000 square feet.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: INTERIOR OF MESSRS. POMMERY AND GRENO'S CELLIER.]\r\n\r\nMadame Pommery made a great mark with her splendid cuvées of 1868 and\r\n1874, the result being that her brand has become widely popular, and\r\nthat it invariably realises exceptionally high prices.\r\n\r\nOn leaving Messrs. Pommery's we retrace our steps down the Avenue\r\nGerbert, bordered on either side with rows of plane-trees, until we\r\nreach the treeless Avenue de Sillery, where Messrs. de St. Marceaux &\r\nCo.'s new and capacious establishment is installed. Simple and without\r\npretension, the establishment, which covers an area of upwards of\r\n18,000 feet, is distinguished for its perfect appropriateness to the\r\nindustry for which it was designed. The principal block of building\r\nis flanked by two advanced wings enclosing a garden-court, set off\r\nwith flowers and shrubs, and from the centre of which rises a circular\r\nshaft, covered in with glass, and admitting light and air to the\r\ncellars below. In the building to the left the wine is received on\r\nits arrival from the vineyard, and here are ranged large quantities\r\nof casks replete with the choice crus of Verzenay, Ay, Cramant, and\r\nBouzy, while thousands of bottles ready for labelling are stacked in\r\nmassive piles at the end of the packing-hall in the corresponding wing\r\nof the establishment. Here, too, a tribe of workpeople are arraying\r\nthe bottles with gold and silver headdresses, and robing them in pink\r\npaper, while others are filling, securing, marking, and addressing\r\nthe cases or baskets destined to Hong-Kong, San Francisco, Yokohama,\r\nBombay, London, New York, St. Petersburg, Berlin, or Paris.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PACKING-HALL OF MESSRS. DE ST. MARCEAUX AT REIMS.]\r\n\r\nThe wine in cask, stored in the left-hand wing, after having been\r\nduly blended in an enormous vat, is drawn off into bottles, which\r\nare then lowered down a shaft to the second tier of cellars by means\r\nof an endless chain, on to which the baskets of bottles are swiftly\r\nhooked. The workman engaged in this duty, in order to guard against\r\nhis falling down the shaft, has a leather belt strapped round his\r\nwaist, by means of which he is secured to an adjoining iron column.\r\nWe descended into the lower cellars down a flight of ninety-three\r\nbroad steps--a depth equal to the height of an ordinary six-storied\r\nhouse--and found no less than four-and-twenty galleries excavated in\r\nthe chalk, devoid of masonry supports, and containing upwards of a\r\nmillion bottles of Champagne. These galleries vary in length, but are\r\nof uniform breadth, and allow either for a couple of racks with wine\r\n_sur pointe_, or stacks of bottles, in four row's on either side, with\r\nample passage-room down the centre.\r\n\r\nThe upper range of cellars comprises two large arched galleries of\r\nconsiderable breadth, one of which contains wine in wood and wine\r\n_sur pointe_, while the other is stocked with bottles of wine heads\r\ndownward, ready to be delivered into the hands of the _dégorgeur_.\r\n\r\nMM. de St. Marceaux & Co. have the honour of supplying the King of the\r\nBelgians, the President of the French Republic, and several German\r\npotentates with an exceedingly delicate Champagne known as the Royal\r\nSt. Marceaux. The same wine is popular in Russia and other parts of\r\nEurope, just as the Dry Royal of the firm is much esteemed in the\r\nUnited States. The brand of the house most appreciated in this country\r\nis its Carte d'Or, a very dry wine, the extra superior quality of the\r\nfirm, which secured the first place at a recent Champagne competition\r\nin England.\r\n\r\nSome little distance beyond the remnants of the ancient fortifications\r\nof Reims, skirting the Butte de St. Nicaise, is the establishment\r\nof Veuve Morelle & Co., successors to Veuve Max Sutaine & Co. This\r\nhouse was founded in 1823 by the late M. Maxime Sutaine, who, like\r\nseveral other notabilities in the Reims wine trade, was as familiar\r\nwith art and science as with the special industry to which he had\r\ndevoted himself. An amateur painter of no mean skill, he showed himself\r\nthoroughly at home in the biographical and critical notices on artists\r\nand art in his native province which he produced. His name, however,\r\nis chiefly identified in literature with his _Essai sur le Vin de\r\nChampagne_.[425] This work may be regarded as the first attempt to\r\ncollect the scattered materials relating to the history of Champagne\r\nwine, and to deal with them in a critical spirit. Though necessarily\r\nimperfect, its value is undoubtedly great, and it has been frequently\r\nquoted from in the present volume. The family of Sutaine long held\r\nan honourable position at Reims, the name of one of M. Max Sutaine's\r\nimmediate ancestors, who filled the position of lieutenant of the city\r\nin 1765, appearing on the bronze slab at the base of the statue of\r\nLouis XV. in the Place Royale, erected during that year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CELLARS OF MAX SUTAINE AND CO. IN THE CHEMIN DE LA\r\nPROCESSION, REIMS.]\r\n\r\nThe cellars of the firm of Veuve Morelle & Co., successors to Max\r\nSutaine & Co., are very extensive; and while more than usually\r\npicturesque in appearance, are in every respect admirably adapted for\r\nthe rearing and development of the delicate wines of the Champagne.\r\nThese cellars, hewn out of the chalk, are of great depth. The firm\r\nhas been careful to adhere to the good traditions of its predecessors\r\nin the composition of its cuvées, and at the same time to avoid those\r\nerrors which experience and the resources of modern science have made\r\nmanifest. Its rule is only to send out wines of a good cru, and never\r\nbefore they are thoroughly matured, thereby avoiding the shipment of\r\nyoung wines. The chief kinds bearing the brand of Max Sutaine & Co. are\r\nVin Brut (of great years), Extra Dry, Creaming Sillery, and Bouzy for\r\nEngland, Sillery Sec for Russia, and Verzenay and Cabinet for Germany\r\nand Belgium.\r\n\r\nIt should be mentioned that of late years the abandoned quarries,\r\nso numerous on this side of the city, have been largely utilised\r\nby the Reims Champagne manufacturers as cellars for the storage of\r\ntheir wines. Beyond the firms that have been already alluded to as\r\npossessing cellars in this direction, there remain to be enumerated\r\nMessrs. Kunkelmann & Co., Ruinart Père et Fils, the Goulets, Jules\r\nChampion, Théophile Roederer, &c. The cellars of several of the last\r\nnamed are immediately outside the Porte Dieu-Lumière, near which\r\nis a seventeenth-century house having let into its face a curious\r\nbas-relief, of evidently much earlier date, the subject of which has\r\nbeen a source of considerable perplexity to local antiquaries.\r\n\r\nA like cloud enshrouds the origin of the name of Dieu-Lumière, bestowed\r\nupon the fortified gate formerly standing here, and originally erected\r\nduring the fourteenth century, when, the circle of the ramparts having\r\nbeen carried round the Bourg de St. Remi so as to unite it to the old\r\ncity, the Porte St. Nicaise was walled up.[426] Like the other portals\r\nof Reims, it has no lack of historical associations. Its vaulted roof\r\nresounded with the trampling of barbed war-steeds when, on the 16th\r\nJuly 1429, Charles the Victorious swept beneath it into the city,\r\nwith Joan of Arc by his side and the steel-clad chivalry of France at\r\nhis back.[427] The year 1583 saw its keys handed to the Duc de Guise,\r\nand the green flag of the League, with its device 'Auspice Christo,'\r\nhoisted above it; and twenty-three years later, as Henri Quatre rode\r\nthrough it amidst shouts of welcome, the jesting remark, 'I had no idea\r\nI was so well beloved at Reims,' was the only attempt at revenge made\r\nby the easy-going Béarnais on the population who had so long flouted\r\nhis authority. Rebuilt in 1620, it witnessed the triumphant return of\r\nGrandpré's cavalry and the Rémois militia, after their victory over\r\nMontal and his Spaniards at La Pompelle in 1657, and the successful\r\nassault of the renegade Saint Priest, whose Cossacks entered the walls\r\nat this point in 1814, and gave way to the most brutal excesses.\r\nNor must it be forgotten that Marie Louise passed through this gate\r\n_en route_ for Paris, on which occasion its summit was crowned with\r\nelaborate allegorical devices supported by cupids weaving garlands of\r\nflowers; or that for several centuries the relics of St. Timotheus and\r\nhis companions were annually carried through it on Whit-Monday by the\r\nclergy of Reims, escorted by a procession of pilgrims, to the scene of\r\nthe martyrdom of these early Christians at La Pompelle.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BAS-RELIEF NEAR THE PORTE DIEU-LUMIÈRE.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n                                  IX.\r\n\r\n                              /Epernay./\r\n\r\n    The connection of Epernay with the production of wine of\r\n    remote date--The town repeatedly burnt and plundered--Hugh the\r\n    Great carries off all the wine of the neighbourhood--Vineyards\r\n    belonging to the Abbey of St. Martin in the eleventh, twelfth,\r\n    and thirteenth centuries--Abbot Gilles orders the demolition of\r\n    a wine-press which infringes the abbey's feudal rights--Bequests\r\n    of vineyards in the fifteenth century--Francis I. bestows Epernay\r\n    on Claude Duke of Guise in 1544--The Eschevins send a present\r\n    of wine to their new seigneur--Wine levied for the king's camp\r\n    at Rethel and the strongholds of the province by the Duc de\r\n    Longueville--Epernay sacked and fired on the approach of Charles\r\n    V.--The Charles-Fontaine vendangeoir at Avenay--Destruction of\r\n    the immense pressoirs of the Abbey of St. Martin--The handsome\r\n    Renaissance entrance to the church of Epernay--Plantation of the\r\n    'terre de siége' with vines in 1550--Money and wine levied on\r\n    Epernay by Condé and the Duke of Guise--Henri Quatre lays siege\r\n    to Epernay--Death of Maréchal Biron--Desperate battle amongst the\r\n    vineyards--Triple talent of the 'bon Roy Henri' for drinking,\r\n    fighting, and love-making--Verses addressed by him to his 'belle\r\n    hôtesse' Anne du Puy--The Epernay Town Council make gifts of wine\r\n    to various functionaries to secure their good-will--Presents of\r\n    wine to Turenne at the coronation of Louis XIV.--Petition to\r\n    Louvois to withdraw the Epernay garrison that the vintage may be\r\n    gathered in--The Duke and Duchess of Orleans at Epernay--Louis\r\n    XIV. partakes of the local vintage at the maison abbatiale on his\r\n    way to the army of the Rhine--Increased reputation of the wine of\r\n    Epernay at the end of the seventeenth century--Numerous offerings\r\n    of it to the Marquis de Puisieux, Governor of the town--The Old\r\n    Pretender presented at Epernay with twenty-four bottles of the\r\n    best--Sparkling wine sent to the Marquis de Puisieux at Sillery,\r\n    and also to his nephew--Further gifts to the Prince de Turenne--The\r\n    vintage destroyed by frost in 1740--The Epernay slopes at this\r\n    epoch said to produce the most delicious wine in Europe--Vines\r\n    planted where houses had formerly stood--The development of the\r\n    trade in sparkling wine--A 'tirage' of fifty thousand bottles\r\n    in 1787--Arthur Young drinks Champagne at Epernay at forty sous\r\n    the bottle--It is surmised that Louis XVI., on his return from\r\n    Varennes, is inspired by Champagne at Epernay--Napoleon and his\r\n    family enjoy the hospitality of Jean Remi Moët--King Jerome\r\n    of Westphalia's true prophecy with regard to the Russians and\r\n    Champagne--Disgraceful conduct of the Prussians and Russians\r\n    at Epernay in 1814--The Mayor offers them the free run of his\r\n    cellars--Charles X., Louis Philippe, and Napoleon III. accept the\r\n    'vin d'honneur' at Epernay--The town occupied by German troops\r\n    during the war of 1870-1.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIf Reims be the titular capital of the Champagne wine-trade, Epernay\r\ncan boast of containing the establishments of some of the most eminent\r\nfirms engaged therein. Its connection with the production of the wines\r\nof Champagne is of the remotest. The vineyards stretching for miles\r\naround the ancient Sparnacum claim indeed an antiquity far exceeding\r\nthat of any existing portion of the town itself, which, despite the\r\nremote date of its foundation, and the fact that it was a place of\r\nconsiderable importance as early as 445, presents a thoroughly modern\r\naspect. Unlike Reims--so rich in the remains of antiquity--it possesses\r\nno mementoes of the days when its lord Eulogius gave it to St.\r\nRemi,[428] and he in turn bequeathed it to the Church.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe reason is simple, for the history of Epernay may be briefly summed\r\nup in the words--fire, pestilence, and pillage. From the days when\r\nmisfortune first overtook it, after the division of the Frankish\r\nmonarchy on the death of Clovis, it has been burnt down on half a dozen\r\noccasions, repeatedly depopulated by the plague, and captured and\r\nsacked times out of number. The contending sovereigns of Austrasia and\r\nNeustria alternately obtained forcible possession of it, and the rival\r\ncounts of Paris and Vermandois snatched it repeatedly from each other's\r\nhold, like hungry dogs contending for a bone; whilst the Normans, the\r\nHungarians, the vassals of Charles of Lorraine, and the followers of\r\nOtho of Germany added their quota to the work of destruction during\r\nthe long period of anarchy preceding the establishment of the Capetian\r\nrace upon the throne of France. The founder of the said race, Hugh the\r\nGreat, distinguished himself in 947 by plundering the town of Epernay,\r\nravaging the surrounding country, and profiting by the fact that it was\r\nvintage-time to carry off all the wine of the neighbourhood.[429]\r\n\r\nEven during the epoch of comparative tranquillity which prevailed up\r\nto the English invasion, Epernay became from time to time the prey of\r\nrobber knights like Thomas de Marlé and rebellious nobles like Count\r\nJohn of Soissons; and at the commencement of the thirteenth century\r\nCount Thibault of Champagne was fain to burn it, in order to prevent it\r\nfrom serving as a rallying-place for the lords who had risen against\r\nQueen Blanche and her infant son Louis IX. After the battle of Poitiers\r\nit was pillaged by the partisans of Charles the Bad of Navarre; Edward\r\nthe Black Prince entered it twice as a conqueror; and John of Gaunt\r\nexacted a heavy tribute from it. In the struggles which followed the\r\ndeath of Henry V. of England it was again taken and re-taken, partially\r\nburnt and utterly ruined, remaining for three years absolutely\r\ndepopulated after the unwelcome visit paid it by the Duke of Burgundy\r\nin 1432.\r\n\r\nYet during all these ravages the vineyards clothing the slopes\r\naround the town were gradually developed, chiefly by the fostering\r\ncare of the good fathers of the Abbey of St. Martin. The charter of\r\nfoundation of this abbey, which was endowed in 1032, makes mention of\r\nvineyards amongst its possessions, and they are also spoken of in the\r\nconfirmation of donations and privileges granted by Pope Eugenius III.\r\nin 1145. Count Henry of Champagne in 1179 gave the canons of the abbey\r\nthe hospital of Epernay, with the fields and vineyards belonging to\r\nit; and twenty years later, Abbot Guy purchased from Abbot Noah, of\r\nthe monastery of the Chapelle aux Planches, near Troyes, the fields,\r\nvineyards, house, barn, and garden adjoining the 'ruisseau du Cotheau'\r\nat Epernay for 110 livres. In 1203, Parchasius, a canon of Laon, left\r\nby will to the abbey the 'vigne du Clozet,' which is still celebrated\r\nfor the excellence of its products, at Epernay; and in 1217, Abbot\r\nTheodoric gave the 'terres de la Croix Boson' at Mardeuil to sundry of\r\nthe inhabitants of that village, on the condition of planting them with\r\nvines and paying a yearly rent of fourteen hogsheads of wine obtained\r\ntherefrom as vinage. Tithes of wine at Oger, Cuis, Cramant, Monthelon,\r\n&c., and the vineyards of Genselin, Beaumont, and Montfelix also figure\r\namongst the possessions of the abbey in the thirteenth century.[430]\r\n\r\nA certain proportion of the tithes of the 'fields, meadows, and\r\nvineyards' owned by the abbey at Epernay was assigned to the dependent\r\npriory in the faubourg of Igny-le-Jard by Abbot Richard de Cuys in\r\n1365. The cultivation of the grape seems to have been carried on\r\nin even the most distant of the numerous possessions of the abbey,\r\nwhich drew 'rentes de vin' from Chatillon and Dormans; and in 1373 we\r\nfind Abbot Gilles de Baronne compelling an unfortunate inhabitant of\r\nRomains, near Fismes, to demolish forthwith a wine-press he had dared\r\nto erect to the prejudice of the 'droits seigneuriaux et bannaux' which\r\nthe abbey had over that village. The military orders had their share,\r\ntoo; for the Commandery of the Temple at Reims owned at Epernay at the\r\ncommencement of the fourteenth century a house and some vineyards,\r\nstill bearing the name of 'Les Tempières.' In 1419, Philippe le\r\nMaître and his wife left to the curé of Epernay a little vineyard\r\nat Montebon to pay for a yearly mass; and at a somewhat later date,\r\nIsabelle la Linotte bequeathed to the abbey the vineyard De la Ronce at\r\nMardeuil.[431]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: FRANCIS I.\r\n\r\n(From a portrait of the time).]\r\n\r\nIndeed, the history of Epernay is most intimately connected with\r\nthat of its wine, which figures throughout its records as a constant\r\nattraction to friends and foes. After the final expulsion of the\r\nEnglish, the town gradually recovered its prosperity, and became an\r\nappanage of the Dukes of Orleans. At the commencement of the sixteenth\r\ncentury we find Francis I.--to whom it had reverted on the death of\r\nLouise of Savoy--presenting it to Claude, Duke of Guise, and the\r\neschevins resolving in 1544 that their new seigneur should be offered\r\n'twenty poinçons of the best wine that can be found in the cellars\r\nof the district, and that after the vintage twenty more of the new\r\ncrop shall be sent to him.'[432] A levy of one hundred poinçons had\r\nalready been demanded of them for the camp formed by the King at\r\nRethel two years before; and the various strongholds of the province\r\nhad been freely supplied with wine exacted from Epernay by the Duke de\r\nLongueville, lieutenant-governor of the Champagne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EMPEROR CHARLES V.\r\n\r\n(From a portrait of the time).]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nOn the advance of Charles V. in 1544, the Dauphin, afterwards Henri\r\nII., following the example successfully set by Anne de Montmorency\r\nin Provence, pitilessly sacked the entire district of the Marne, in\r\norder that the enemy might find nothing to live on, and stored the\r\nproduct, which included an enormous quantity of wine, in Epernay. The\r\nEmperor advanced, meeting with but little opposition, and having taken\r\nup his quarters in the Abbey of Avenay, amused himself with building\r\nthe vendangeoir known as Charles-Fontaine on the adjacent slope, as a\r\ntestimony of his intention to make, if possible, a permanent sojourn in\r\na province, the vinous products of which he so highly esteemed.[433]\r\nBut whilst the illustrious patron of Titian and his 'swarthy grave\r\ncommanders' were snugly tippling the choicest vintages contained in the\r\nabbey cellars, and his followers camped outside Epernay were waiting\r\nfor the hour when they should revel at pleasure on the wine stored\r\nin the town, their hopes vanished literally in smoke. For Francis,\r\nfearing the town would be unable to hold out, had sent word to Captain\r\nSery to burn it, and destroy the accumulated store of provisions,\r\nin order to prevent them falling into the hands of the enemy. This\r\nwas accordingly done on the 3d September, and amongst the property\r\nconsumed were the immense pressoirs of the Abbey of St. Martin. In\r\nthis conflagration the church of Epernay was no doubt also destroyed,\r\nas the handsome Renaissance doorway--the sole ancient portion of the\r\nexisting edifice--was evidently erected in the latter half of the\r\nsixteenth century. The misfortunes of the town did not cease with this\r\ncalamity, for a great pestilence seems to have marked the return of the\r\ninhabitants to their ruined dwellings at the epoch of the following\r\nvintage.[434] Five years later, six arpents of the 'terre de siege'\r\nwhere the Spaniards had encamped were planted with vines by the Count\r\nde Nanteuil-le-Haudouin, and received the name of the Vineyard de la\r\nPlante.[435]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MARIE STUART, QUEEN OF SCOTS.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: RENAISSANCE DOORWAY TO THE CHURCH OF EPERNAY.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ATTACK ON THE HUGUENOTS AT EPERNAY.]\r\n\r\nAs a matter of course, the hapless fate of the town pursued it during\r\nthe religious wars of the sixteenth century. In 1567 the Huguenots,\r\nunder Condé, seized on Epernay--then a portion of the appanage of the\r\nunfortunate Marie Stuart of Scotland--and exacted a ransom of 10,500\r\nlivres, towards which the Abbey of St. Martin contributed 3451 livres,\r\npartly in money and partly in wine, calculated at no more than eleven\r\nlivres the queue. A higher price appears to have ruled on the recapture\r\nof the town by the Duke of Guise the same year, when the levy made\r\nconsisted of 500 pièces of wine, estimated at twenty-four livres the\r\nqueue.[436] Guise was driven out by the inhabitants in 1588; but after\r\none fruitless assault, the Leaguers under Rosné succeeded in obtaining\r\nforcible possession of Epernay four years later.\r\n\r\nOn Henri Quatre laying siege in turn to Epernay in 1592, the vineyards\r\naround the town were again literally watered with blood. One notable\r\nepisode of this siege was the death of Maréchal Biron, the most\r\ndevoted of Henri's adherents. On the 27th July the King and Biron were\r\nreturning on horseback from Damery to the camp. As they advanced up the\r\nroad leading from Mardeuil to the faubourg of Igny, the wind blew off\r\nHenri's hat, adorned with the famous white plume, and Biron, picking\r\nit up, jestingly placed it upon his own head. At this moment the white\r\nplume unluckily caught the eye of Petit, the master gunner of Epernay,\r\nand he at once pointed a cannon at it from the Tour Saint Antoine. 'For\r\nthe Béarnais!' he exclaimed, as he fired; and the ball carried away\r\nthe head of the Maréchal, to whom Henri was speaking, and upon whose\r\nshoulder the King's hand was actually resting. 'Ah, mordieu, the dog\r\nhas bitten the Béarnais!' cried the exulting gunner, believing it was\r\nthe King who had fallen, and alluding to the name of the cannon, which\r\nwas known as the 'Dog of Orleans,' from its having been captured from\r\nthe English at the siege of that city, and bearing on its breech the\r\nfigure of a dog.[437]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRI QUATRE BEFORE EPERNAY.]\r\n\r\nThe death of Maréchal Biron, and the fact that Henri was devoting quite\r\nas much attention to his 'belle hôtesse' at Damery, the fair Présidente\r\nAnne du Puy, as he was to the siege, encouraged St. Paul, who commanded\r\nat Reims for the League, to despatch a strong body of Walloon pikemen\r\nand musketeers to the relief of the beleaguered town. They approached\r\nby the hollow road leading from the Faubourg des Ponts Neufs to the\r\nslope of the Vignes des Capinets, and passing between the vineyards\r\nDure Epine and Gouttes d'Or. Attacked by the Royalists, they drew up\r\nin good order in the latter spot, and prepared to defend themselves\r\nwith all the stubborn valour of their race, their dense array of pikes\r\nbristling amongst the bright green leaves--for it was the close of\r\nsummer, and the vines were in all the glory of their luxuriant foliage.\r\nVainly for a long time the Royalists assailed them. Attack after attack\r\nwas repulsed, till the 'golden drops' were turned to drops of gore; and\r\nit was not until the white plume of King Henri came dashing on in the\r\nforefront of his choicest cavalry that the Walloons were finally broken\r\nand routed, after inflicting upon their assailants a far greater loss\r\nthan they themselves sustained. The vineyard thus baptised in blood was\r\nthenceforward known as the Vigne des Sièges.[438]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThough data may be lacking to connect the 'bon Roi Henri' directly with\r\nthe wine of Epernay, there can be no doubt that the sovereign whose\r\ntriple talent for drinking, fighting, and love-making has been handed\r\ndown to us in song[439] found a fair opportunity of exercising all\r\nthree of these attributes during the siege. Of fighting, as we have\r\nseen, he had plenty, and, Anacreon-like, he seems to have blended love\r\nand wine together.[440] He who, when a new-born babe, had his lips\r\nwetted in the old castle of Pau by stout Antoine de Bourbon with a cup\r\nof the generous wine of the South, and who gloried in the title of the\r\nSieur d'Ay, was not likely to neglect the nectar vintaged on the slopes\r\naround Epernay. And probably the recollection of the raven-haired,\r\nblack-eyed, bronze-skinned Bernais peasant-girls, whom tradition vows\r\nhe used to woo when in the first flush of youthful manhood beneath the\r\ntrellised vines of Jurançon and Gan, served by contrast to heighten the\r\nfairer charms of the blonde Anne du Puy, in whose honour he is reported\r\nto have sung:\r\n\r\n        'Morning bright,\r\n        Thy pure light\r\n    I rejoice when I see;\r\n        The fair dove\r\n        Whom I love\r\n    So, is rosy like thee.\r\n\r\n        She is fair,\r\n        None so rare,\r\n    With a waist matched by none;\r\n        By my hand\r\n        It is spanned,\r\n    And eyes bright as the sun.\r\n\r\n        Wet with new\r\n        Fallen dew,\r\n    The rose sparkles less bright;\r\n        Freer from spot\r\n        Ermine's not,\r\n    Nor is lily more white.\r\n\r\n        Fair Dupuis,\r\n        All agree,\r\n    On ambrosia is fed;\r\n        From her lip\r\n        When I sip\r\n    Nectar's perfume is shed.'[441]\r\n\r\nAt the outset of the seventeenth century Epernay had its full share in\r\nthe troubles that marked the early part of the reign of Louis XIII.,\r\nbeing taken in turn by Condé, by the Count de Soissons, acting for\r\nthe malcontent nobles leagued against Richelieu in 1634, and by the\r\nKing's forces the year following. The peaceful records are, however,\r\nplentiful and interesting. In 1631 we find the town council deciding\r\nto present 'six caques of white wine, the best that can be found,' to\r\nM. de Vignolles, and the same to M. d'Elbenne; and two years later\r\nprotesting to the 'treasurers of France' their inability to pay 70,000\r\nlivres, demanded towards the maintenance of the army, owing to the all\r\nbut total failure of the wine crop. The council were fully aware of\r\nthe merits of their vintage, and of the advantages of appealing to the\r\nheart by way of the stomach. Six 'feuillettes' of the best wine were\r\nordered to be sent in September 1636 to M. de Vaubecourt, and one to\r\nhis secretary, 'to retain their good-will towards the town,' and induce\r\nthe former to use his influence with a committee appointed by the King\r\nfor repaying loans and advances, and also towards getting rid of the\r\ngarrison. A little later the Marquis de Senneterre received a queue of\r\nwine to withdraw his troops from the town. The Maréchal de Chatillon,\r\nM. de Vaubecourt, M. de Belfonds, and the Count d'Estaing were in\r\nfrequent receipt of such gifts; and it is noteworthy that amongst them\r\nfigure 'two caques of wine in bottles,' sent to each of the two first\r\nat Sainte Ménéhoulde in 1639.[442]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe successful efforts of Turenne against his great rival Condé during\r\nthe wars of the Fronde were encouraged by frequent presents of the wine\r\nof Epernay. As the brother of the Duc de Bouillon, to whom the town\r\nof Epernay had been given in 1643 in exchange for Sedan, and as the\r\nprotector of the district against the Spaniards, he received numerous\r\ntokens of the citizens' good-will. In September 1652 twelve caques of\r\nwine were sent to him, with the result that he at once ordered his\r\nsoldiers to repair the broken bridge across the Marne. In the following\r\nJanuary a chevreuil and two caques, and in June wine, fowls, and game,\r\nwere presented to him. In June 1654 it was resolved that a deputation\r\nshould be sent to the coronation of Louis XIV. at Reims, 'to render the\r\nhomage due to the King,' and to present 'a caque of wine in bottles' to\r\nM. de Turenne, which helped no doubt to spread the fame of the Epernay\r\nwine amongst the nobility present on that occasion.\r\n\r\nThe same social lever was applied in 1660 to the 'traitant général'\r\nof the so-called 'don gratuit' exacted on the occasion of the King's\r\nmarriage, two feuillettes being proffered in order to get him to\r\nreduce the assessment. Representations made to an eschevin of Paris,\r\ndespatched to Epernay in 1662 to see if there was any store of grain\r\nin the town that could be sold to benefit the starving poor of the\r\ncapital, to the effect that the district was a wine-growing and not\r\na corn country; and the despatch of a deputation in August 1666 to\r\nLouvois, to request that the garrison might be withdrawn to allow of\r\nthe vintage being gathered in--the inhabitants of the surrounding\r\ncountry having fled to avoid sheltering soldiers,--serve to show the\r\nimportance of the Epernay wine-trade. In 1671, on the passage of the\r\nDuke and Duchess of Orleans from Châlons, fruit and sweetmeats were\r\npresented to them, and wine to the lords of their suite, at a cost of\r\n211 livres 7 sols; and two years later, Louis XIV. partook of the local\r\nvintage during his sojourn at the 'maison abbatiale,' when on his way\r\nto the army of the Rhine.\r\n\r\nTowards the close of this century the wine grew in repute, and was\r\neagerly sought after. In November 1677 two caques were sent to 'a\r\nperson who enjoys some credit,' and who was willing to accord his\r\nprotection to the town in the matter of quartering troops upon it;\r\nand the following January twelve more caques were despatched to this\r\n'unknown,' who may have been Louvois himself. As to Roger Brulart,\r\nMarquis de Puisieux et de Sillery and Governor of Epernay, a joyous\r\ncompanion, if we may credit St. Simon, his appreciation of the local\r\nvintage is borne ample testimony to. In 1677 six caques of 'the best'\r\nwere sent to him by the town council; but by 1691 he must have become\r\nused to larger offerings, as in September a letter was addressed to him\r\nbegging him to be satisfied with the like amount, as 'the inhabitants\r\ncould not manage more,' and could only promise, with regard to three\r\ncaques still due, that they would 'make an effort' to supply them the\r\nfollowing year. Wise in their generation, they sent at the same time\r\n'twelve bottles of the best wine' to his intendant, and a similar gift\r\nto his secretary; but the following year they were forced to write\r\nagain that it would be impossible to supply the wine promised unless he\r\nobtained a permission to levy it.[443]\r\n\r\nThe Old Pretender, or, as he is styled in the local records, 'Jacques\r\nStuart III., roy d'Angleterre,' arrived at Epernay in September 1712,\r\nand was presented with 'twenty-four bottles of the best;' whilst the\r\nMarquis de Puisieux, who accompanied him, was satisfied with nothing\r\nless than a 'carteau,' or quarter-cask. And when the latter announced\r\nhis intention of paying a visit in the autumn of 1719 to Maître\r\nAdam Bertin du Rocheret, conseiller du roy and ex-president of the\r\nGrenier-à-sel at Epernay, a resolution was passed to offer him wine\r\non his arrival, and to send 'a hundred _flasks_ of the best' to his\r\nchâteau of Sillery. The use of the word 'flaçons' clearly implies that\r\nthe discoveries of Dom Perignon were being acted upon at Epernay, and\r\nthat the gift in question was one of sparkling wine.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JAMES EDWARD FRANCIS STUART, THE OLD PRETENDER.]\r\n\r\nIn June 1722 the Sieurs Quatresous and Chertemps, despatched to\r\ncongratulate the marquis's nephew and successor, Louis Philogène\r\nBrulart, on his appointment to the governorship of the town and his\r\nmarriage with Mademoiselle de Souvré, granddaughter of Louvois,\r\ntook with them a similar offering. At the coronation of Louis XV.,\r\nin October, deputies were sent to compliment the Prince de Turenne,\r\nrepresentative of his father the Duc de Bouillon, seigneur d'Epernay,\r\nand to present him with 'game, trout, and other fish,' and 'a basket\r\nof a hundred flasks of the best.' In August 1725 the bourgeois were\r\ndrawn up under arms, and four dozen bottles were got ready, on the\r\npassage through the town of the Duke of Orleans, son of the late\r\nRegent, on his way to espouse, as the King's proxy, Marie Leczinska.\r\nThis was, however, a sad year for the wine-growers, for ten months\r\nof incessant rain, beginning in April, not only ruined the at first\r\npromising crop entirely, but caused floods which wrought some havoc.\r\nThe terrible hail-storm of 1730, which devastated the vineyards of\r\nReims, fortunately spared those of Epernay; but a frost in October\r\n1740 destroyed the vintage, and led to a dearness of provisions which\r\npressed even on the most well-to-do.[444]\r\n\r\nFor the next three-quarters of a century Epernay continued quietly\r\nto profit by the yield of 'the slopes laden with vines producing the\r\nmost delicious wines in Europe,' to quote the expression of Stapart,\r\nwho in 1749 notes the importance of the trade in wine carried on,\r\nnot only with Paris, but with foreign countries; though at the same\r\ntime complaining of the decreasing size of the town, and the fact of\r\nvineyards being planted where houses had formerly stood.[445] The\r\nonly events of importance were from time to time an unusually good\r\nor an uncommonly bad crop, or--as the manufacture of _vin mousseux_\r\ngradually swallowed up that of still wine--a disastrous _casse_, like\r\nthe memorable one of 1776, varied by an occasional royal visit or so.\r\nBy 1780, Max Sutaine notes that a single manufacturer would turn out\r\nfrom five to six thousand bottles of sparkling Champagne, and exults\r\nover the fact that seven years later an enterprising firm risked a\r\n_tirage_ of fifty thousand, though people at the time regarded this as\r\nsomething prodigious, and wondered where an outlet would be found.[446]\r\nVery likely a bottle of this identical _tirage_ was 'the excellent\r\n_vin mousseux_' with which Arthur Young regaled himself, at a cost\r\nof forty sous, on the 7th July of the same year, at that 'very good\r\ninn' the Hôtel de Rohan, at Epernay.[447] At this same inn the hapless\r\nLouis XVI. stopped to dine on his return from the intercepted flight to\r\nVarennes; and when we recall his timid nature, we may fairly surmise\r\nthat it was Champagne which inspired him, amidst the insults of the\r\nmob, to remind the authorities that his ancestor, Henri Quatre, had\r\nentered the town in a very different fashion, and by implication to\r\nassert that he might yet do the same.[448]\r\n\r\nThe Emperor Napoleon, the Empress Josephine, the King of Westphalia,\r\nand the other members of the Bonaparte dynasty, who from time to time\r\nvisited Epernay and partook of the hospitality of Jean Remi Moët,\r\nshowed a healthy appreciation of its vintage. Indeed King Jerome, in\r\ngiving an order for six thousand bottles _premier cru_, remarked with\r\na strange foresight that he would have taken more, only he was afraid\r\nthat it would be the Russians after all who would come and drink it.\r\nSure enough the eventful year 1814 witnessed the arrival at Epernay of\r\na host of self-invited guests, all equally appreciative of the merits\r\nof Champagne, and gifted with an almost unlimited power of consumption,\r\nbut entertaining insuperable objections to pay for what they consumed.\r\nThe Prussians and Russians who came hither in February and March\r\nmisconducted themselves in a very sad manner, burning and pillaging\r\nhouses, insulting and maltreating the inhabitants, requisitioning all\r\nthe wine they could lay hands on, and drinking in a manner recalling\r\nthe Bacchic exploits of Gargantua and Pantagruel. The mayor, Jean Remi\r\nMoët, moved by the state of affairs, offered the invaders the free run\r\nof his cellars rather than that they should pillage those of others,\r\ndoubtless under the idea that the reputation his house would thus\r\nacquire abroad would soon enable him to retrieve the temporary loss--a\r\nproviso happily and amply realised. Beyond the facts that Epernay has\r\nprofited, and continues to profit, by the ever-increasing development\r\nof the taste for sparkling wine; that Charles X., Louis Philippe, and\r\nNapoleon III. have successively favoured it with their presence, and\r\naccepted the _vin d'honneur_ offered on such occasions; and that during\r\nthe war of 1870-1 the town, in common with the rest of the province of\r\nChampagne, was occupied by the German invading army, there is nothing\r\nmore to be said respecting its history.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE RUE DU COMMERCE (FAUBOURG DE LA FOLIE), EPERNAY.]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE PACKING-HALL AT MESSRS.

Moët & Chandon, whose\r\nfamous 'Star' brand is familiar in every part of the civilised globe,\r\nand whose half-score miles of cellars contain as many million bottles\r\nof Champagne as there are millions of inhabitants in most of the\r\nsecondary European States, have their head-quarters at Epernay in a\r\nspacious château--in that street of châteaux named the Rue du Commerce,\r\nbut commonly known as the Faubourg de la Folie--which is approached\r\nthrough handsome iron gates, and has beautiful gardens in the rear\r\nextending in the direction of the River Marne. The existing firm\r\ndates from the year 1833, but the family of Moët--conjectured to have\r\noriginally come from the Low Countries--had already been associated\r\nwith the Champagne wine trade for well-nigh a century previously. If\r\nthe Moëts came from Holland they must have established themselves in\r\nthe Champagne at a very early date, for the annals of Reims record\r\nthat in the fourteenth century Jehan Moët de Mennemont, _escuier_,\r\nheld a fief at Attigny from the Archbishop Richard Pique, and that\r\nin the following century Jean and Nicolas Moët were _échevins_ of\r\nthe city. A Moët was present in that capacity at the coronation of\r\nCharles VII. in 1429, when Joan of Arc stood erect by the principal\r\naltar of the cathedral with her sacred banner in her hand; and for\r\nhaving contributed to repulse an attempt on the part of the English to\r\nprevent the entrance of the Royal party into the city, the Moëts were\r\nsubsequently ennobled by the same monarch. A mural tablet in the church\r\nof St. Remi records the death of D. G. Moët, Grand Prior, in 1554; and\r\nnine years later we find Nicol Moët claiming exemption at Epernay for\r\nthe payment of _tailles_ on the ground of his being a noble.\r\n\r\nAn old commercial book preserved in the family archives shows that in\r\nthe year 1743--at the epoch when the rashness of the Duc de Grammont\r\nsaved the English army under George II. from being cut to pieces at\r\nDettingen--a descendant of the foregoing, one Claude Louis Nicolas\r\nMoët, who owned considerable vineyard property in the vicinity of\r\nEpernay, decided upon embarking in the wine trade. It is his son,\r\nhowever, Jean Remi Moët, born in 1758, who may be looked upon as the\r\nveritable founder of the present commerce in Champagne wines, which,\r\nthanks to his efforts, received a wonderful impulse, so that instead\r\nof the consumption of the vintages of the Marne being limited as\r\nheretofore to the privileged few, it spread all over the civilised\r\nworld.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: JEAN REMI MOËT.]\r\n\r\nAt Messrs. Moët & Chandon's we had the opportunity of inspecting some\r\nof the old account-books of the firm, and more particularly those\r\nrecording the transactions of Jean Remi Moët and his father. The first\r\nsales of sparkling wine, on May 23d, 1743, comprised 301 bottles of the\r\nvintage of 1741 to Pierre Joly, wine-merchant, _bon des douze chez le\r\nRoi_, whatever that may mean, at Paris; 120 bottles to Pierre Gabriel\r\nBaudoin, also _bon des douze_, at Paris; and a similar quantity to the\r\nSieur Compoin, keeping the 'hotellerie ditte la pestitte Escurie,' Rue\r\ndu Port-Maillart, at Nantes in Brittany. The entry specifies that the\r\nwine for Nantes is to be left at Choisy-le-Roi, and taken by land to\r\nOrleans by the carters of that town, who are to be found at the Ecu\r\nd'Orléans, Porte St. Michel, Paris, the carriage as far as Choisy being\r\n4 livres 10 deniers (about 4 francs) for the two half-baskets, and to\r\nParis 3 livres 15 deniers the basket.\r\n\r\nBetween 1750 and '60 parcels of wine were despatched to Warsaw, Vienna,\r\nBerlin, Königsberg, Dantzig, Stettin, Brussels, and Amsterdam; but\r\none found no mention of any sales to England till the year 1788, when\r\nthe customers of the firm included 'Milord' Farnham, of London, and\r\nMessrs. Felix Calvert & Sylvin, who had a couple of sample-bottles\r\nsent to them, for which they were charged five shillings. In the\r\nsame year Messrs. Carbonnell, Moody, & Walker (predecessors of the\r\nwell-known existing firm of Carbonnell & Co.) wrote in French for two\r\nbaskets, of ten dozens each, of _vin de Champagne_ 'of good body,\r\nnot too charged with liqueur, but of excellent taste, and not at all\r\nsparkling.' The Chevalier Colebrook, writing from Bath, also requests\r\nthat 72 bottles of Champagne may be sent to his friend the Hon. John\r\nButler, Molesworth-street, Dublin, 'who, if contented with the wine,\r\nwill become a good customer, he being rich, keeping a good house, and\r\nreceiving many amateurs of _vin de Champagne_.' Shortly afterwards the\r\nChevalier himself receives 50 bottles of still wine, vintage 1783. In\r\n1789 120 bottles of Champagne, vintage 1788, are supplied to 'Milord'\r\nFindlater, of London; and in 1790 the customers of the house include\r\nPower & Michel, of 44 Lamb-street, London, and Manning, of the St.\r\nAlban Tavern, the latter of whom is supplied on March 30th with 130\r\nbottles of Champagne at three livres, or two 'schillings,' per bottle;\r\nwhile a month later Mr. Lockart, banker, of 36 Pall Mall, is debited\r\nwith 360 bottles, vintage 1788, at three shillings.\r\n\r\nIn this same year M. Moët despatches a traveller to England named\r\nJeanson, and his letters, some two hundred in number, are all preserved\r\nin the archives of the house. On the 17th May 1790 he writes from\r\nLondon as follows: 'As yet I have only gone on preparatory and often\r\nuseless errands. I have distributed samples of which I have no news.\r\nPatience is necessary, and I endeavour to provide myself with it. How\r\nthe taste of this country has changed since ten years ago! Almost\r\neverywhere they ask for dry wine, but at the same time require it so\r\nvinous and so strong that there is scarcely any other than the wine\r\nof Sillery which can satisfy them.... To-morrow I dine five miles\r\nfrom here, at M. Macnamara's. We shall uncork four bottles of our\r\nwine, which will probably be all right.' In May 1792 Jean Remi Moët is\r\nmarried, and thenceforward assumes the full management of the house.\r\nOn December 20 of the year following, when the Reign of Terror was\r\nfairly inaugurated, we find the accounts in the ledger opened to this\r\nor the other 'citoyen.' The orthodox Republican formula, however, did\r\nnot long continue, and 'sieur' and 'monsieur' resumed their accustomed\r\nplaces, showing that Jean Remi Moët had no sympathy with the Jacobin\r\nfaction of the day. In 1805 he became Mayor of Epernay, and between\r\nthis time and the fall of the Empire received Napoleon several times\r\nat his residence, as well as the Empress Josephine and the King of\r\nWestphalia. The Emperor, after recapturing Reims from the Allies, came\r\non to Epernay, on which occasion he presented M. Moët with the Cross\r\nof the Legion of Honour. In 1830 the latter was arbitrarily dismissed\r\nfrom his mayoralty by Charles X., but was speedily reinstated by Louis\r\nPhilippe, though he did not retain his office for long, his advanced\r\nage compelling him to retire from active life in the course of 1833. At\r\nthis epoch the firm, which since 1807 had been known as Moët & Co., was\r\nremodelled under the style of Moët & Chandon, the two partners being\r\nM. Victor Moët, son of the outgoing partner, and M. P. G. Chandon, the\r\ndescendant of an old ennobled family of the Mâconnais, who had married\r\nM. Jean Remi Moët's eldest daughter. The descendants of these gentlemen\r\nare to-day (1880) at the head of the business, the partners being, on\r\nthe one hand, M. Victor Moët-Romont and M. C. J. V. Auban Moët-Romont;\r\nand on the other, MM. Paul and Raoul Chandon de Briailles.\r\n\r\nFacing Messrs. Moët & Chandon's offices at Epernay is a range of\r\ncomparatively new buildings, with its white façade ornamented with\r\nthe well-known monogram M. & C., surmounted by the familiar star.\r\nIt is here that the business of blending and bottling the wine is\r\ncarried on. Passing through the arched gateway, access is obtained\r\nto a spacious courtyard, where carts laden with bottles are being\r\nexpeditiously lightened of their fragile contents by the busy hands of\r\nnumerous workmen. Another gateway on the left leads into the spacious\r\nbottle-washing room, which from the middle of May until the middle\r\nof July presents a scene of extraordinary animation. Bottle-washing\r\napparatus, supplied by a steam-engine with 20,000 gallons of water\r\nper diem, are ranged in fifteen rows down the entire length of this\r\nhall, and nearly 200 women strive to excel each other in diligence\r\nand celerity in their management, a practised hand washing from 900\r\nto 1000 bottles in the course of the day. To the right of this _salle\r\nde rinçage_, as it is styled, bottles are stacked in their tens of\r\nthousands, and lads furnished with barrows, known as _diables_, hurry\r\nto and fro, conveying these to the washers, or removing the clean\r\nbottles to the adjacent courtyard, where they are allowed to drain\r\nprior to being taken to the _salle de tirage_ or bottling-room.\r\n\r\nBefore, however, the washing of bottles on this gigantic scale\r\ncommences, the 'marrying' or blending of the wine is accomplished in\r\na vast apartment, 250 feet in length and 100 feet broad, during the\r\nearly spring. The casks of newly-vintaged wine, which have been stowed\r\naway during the winter months in the extensive range of cellars hewn\r\nout of the chalk underlying Epernay, where they have slowly fermented,\r\nare mixed together in due proportion in huge vats, each holding upwards\r\nof 12,000 gallons. Some of this wine is the growth of Messrs. Moët &\r\nChandon's own vineyards, of which they possess as many as 900 acres\r\n(giving constant employment to 800 labourers and vinedressers) at Ay,\r\nAvenay, Bouzy, Cramant, Champillon, Chouilly, Dizy, Epernay, Grauves,\r\nHautvillers, Le Mesnil, Moussy, Pierry, Saran, St. Martin, Verzy, and\r\nVerzenay, and the average annual cost of cultivating which is about\r\n£40 per acre. At Ay the firm own 210 acres of vineyards; at Cramant\r\nand Chouilly, nearly 180 acres; at Verzy and Verzenay, 120 acres; at\r\nPierry and Grauves, upwards of 100 acres; at Hautvillers, 90 acres;\r\nat Le Mesnil, 80 acres; at Epernay, nearly 60 acres; and at Bouzy,\r\n55 acres. Messrs. Moët & Chandon, moreover, possess vendangeoirs,\r\nor pressing-houses, at Ay, Bouzy, Cramant, Epernay, Hautvillers, Le\r\nMesnil, Pierry, Saran, and Verzenay, in which the large number of 40\r\npresses are installed. At these vendangeoirs no less than 5450 pièces\r\nof fine white wine, sufficient for 1,360,000 bottles of Champagne, are\r\nannually made--that is, 1200 pièces at Ay, 1100 at Cramant and Saran,\r\n800 at Verzy and Verzenay, and smaller quantities at the remaining\r\nestablishments. All these establishments have their celliers and their\r\ncellars, together with cottages for the accommodation of the numerous\r\nvinedressers in the employment of the firm.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: WASHING BOTTLES AT MESSRS. MOËT AND CHANDON'S, EPERNAY.]\r\n\r\nExtensive as are the vineyards owned by Messrs. Moët & Chandon, the\r\nyield from them is utterly inadequate to the enormous demand which\r\nthe great Epernay firm are annually called upon to supply, and large\r\npurchases have to be made by their agents from the growers throughout\r\nthe Champagne. The wine thus secured, as well as that grown by the\r\nfirm, is duly mixed together in such proportions as will insure\r\nlightness with the requisite vinosity, and fragrance combined with\r\neffervescence, a thorough amalgamation being effected by stirring up\r\nthe wine with long poles provided with fan-shaped ends. If the vintage\r\nbe indifferent in quality, the firm have scores of huge tuns filled\r\nwith the yield of more favoured seasons to fall back upon to insure any\r\ndeficiencies of character and flavour being supplied.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MESSRS. MOËT AND CHANDON'S VENDANGEOIR AT BOUZY.]\r\n\r\nThe casks of wine to be blended are raised from the cellars, half a\r\ndozen at a time, by means of a lift provided with an endless chain,\r\nand worked by the steam-engine of which we have already spoken. They\r\nare emptied, through traps in the floor of the room above, into the\r\nhuge vats which, standing upon a raised platform, reach almost to the\r\nceiling. From these vats the fluid is allowed to flow through hose into\r\nrows of casks stationed below. Before being bottled the wine reposes\r\nfor a certain time; is next duly racked and again blended; and is\r\neventually conveyed through silver-plated pipes into oblong reservoirs,\r\neach fitted with a dozen syphon-taps, so arranged that directly the\r\nbottle slipped on to one of them becomes full the wine ceases to flow.\r\n\r\nUpwards of 200 workpeople are employed in the _salle de tirage_ at\r\nMessrs. Moët & Chandon's, which, while the operation of bottling is\r\ngoing on, presents a scene of bewildering activity. Men and lads are\r\ngathered round the syphon-taps, briskly removing the bottles as they\r\nbecome filled, and supplanting them by empty ones. Other lads hasten to\r\ntransport the filled bottles on trucks to the corkers, whose so-called\r\n'guillotine' machines send the corks home with a sudden thud. The\r\ncorks being secured with _agrafes_, the bottles are placed in large\r\nflat baskets called _manettes_, and wheeled away on trucks, the quarts\r\nbeing deposited in the cellars by means of lifts, while the pints\r\nslide down an inclined plane by the aid of an endless chain, which\r\nraises the trucks with the empty baskets at the same time the full\r\nones make their descent into the cellars. What with the incessant thud\r\nof the corking-machines, the continual rolling of iron-wheeled trucks\r\nover the concrete floor, the rattling and creaking of the machinery\r\nworking the lifts, the occasional sharp report of a bursting bottle,\r\nand the loudly-shouted orders of the foremen, who display the national\r\npartiality for making a noise to perfection, the din becomes at times\r\nall but unbearable. The number of bottles filled in the course of the\r\nday naturally varies, still Messrs. Moët & Chandon reckon that during\r\nthe month of June a daily average of 100,000 are taken in the morning\r\nfrom the stacks in the _salle de rinçage_, washed, dried, filled,\r\ncorked, wired, lowered into the cellars, and carefully arranged in\r\nsymmetrical order. This represents a total of two and a half million\r\nbottles during that month alone.\r\n\r\nThe bottles on being lowered into the cellars, either by means of the\r\nincline or the lifts, are placed in a horizontal position, and, with\r\ntheir uppermost side daubed with white chalk, are stacked in layers\r\nfrom two to half a dozen bottles deep, with narrow oak laths between.\r\nThe stacks are usually about 6 or 7 feet high, and 100 feet and\r\nupwards in length. Whilst the wine is thus reposing in a temperature\r\nof about 55° Fahrenheit, fermentation sets in, and the ensuing month\r\nis one of much anxiety. Thanks, however, to the care bestowed, Messrs.\r\nMoët & Chandon's annual loss from bottles bursting rarely exceeds\r\nthree per cent, though fifteen was once regarded as a respectable and\r\nsatisfactory average. The broken glass is a perquisite of the workmen,\r\nthe money arising from its sale, which at the last distribution\r\namounted to no less than 20,000 francs, being divided amongst them\r\nevery couple of years.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: BOTTLING CHAMPAGNE AT MESSRS. MOËT AND CHANDON'S,\r\nEPERNAY.]\r\n\r\nThe usual entrance to Messrs. Moët & Chandon's Epernay cellars--which,\r\nburrowed out in all directions, are of the aggregate length of nearly\r\nseven miles, and have usually between 10,000,000 and 12,000,000 bottles\r\nand 20,000 casks of wine stored therein--is through a wide and imposing\r\nportal, and down a long and broad flight of steps. It is, however,\r\nby the ancient and less imposing entrance, through which more than\r\none crowned head has condescended to pass, that we set forth on our\r\nlengthened tour through these intricate underground galleries--this\r\nsubterranean city, with its miles of streets, cross-roads, open spaces,\r\ntramways, and stations devoted solely to Champagne. A gilt inscription\r\non a black-marble tablet testifies that 'on the 26th July 1807,\r\nNapoleon the Great, Emperor of the French, King of Italy, and Protector\r\nof the Confederation of the Rhine, honoured commerce by visiting\r\nthe cellars of Jean Remi Moët, Mayor of Epernay, President of the\r\nCanton, and Member of the General Council of the Department,' within\r\nthree weeks of the signature of the treaty of Tilsit. Passing down\r\nthe flight of steep slippery steps traversed by the victor of Eylau\r\nand Jena, access is gained to the upper range of vaults, brilliantly\r\nilluminated by the glare of gas, or dimly lighted by the flickering\r\nflame of tallow-candles, upwards of 60,000 lb. of which are annually\r\nconsumed. Here group after group of the small army of 350 workmen\r\nemployed in these subterranean galleries are encountered, engaged in\r\nthe process of transforming the _vin brut_ into Champagne. At Messrs.\r\nMoët & Chandon's, the all-important operation of liqueuring the wine is\r\neffected by aid of machines of the latest construction, which regulate\r\nthe quantity administered to the utmost nicety. The corks are branded\r\nby being pressed against steel dies heated by gas by women, who can\r\nturn out 3000 per day apiece, the quantity of string used to secure\r\nthem amounting to nearly ten tons in the course of the year.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TABLET COMMEMORATIVE OF THE VISIT OF NAPOLEON I.]\r\n\r\nThere is another and a lower depth of cellars to be explored, to\r\nwhich access is gained by trap-holes in the floor--through which the\r\nbarrels and baskets of wine are raised and lowered--and by flights of\r\nsteps. From the foot of the latter there extends an endless vista of\r\nlofty and spacious passages hewn out of the chalk, the walls of which,\r\nsmooth as finished masonry, are lined with thousands of casks of raw\r\nwine, varied at intervals by gigantic vats. Miles of long, dark-brown,\r\ndampish-looking galleries stretch away to the right and left, devoid\r\nof the picturesque festoons of fungi which decorate the London Dock\r\nvaults, yet exhibiting a sufficient degree of mouldiness to give them\r\nan air of respectable antiquity. These multitudinous galleries, lit\r\nup by petroleum-lamps, are mostly lined with wine in bottles stacked\r\nin compact masses to a height of six or seven feet, only room enough\r\nfor a single person to pass being left. Millions of bottles are thus\r\narranged, the majority on their side, in huge piles, with tablets hung\r\nup against each stack to note its age and quality; and the rest, which\r\nare undergoing daily evolutions at the hands of the twister, in racks\r\nat various angles of inclination. These cellars contain nearly 11,000\r\nracks, and as many as 600,000 bottles are commonly twisted here daily.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe way runs on between regiments of bottles of the same size and\r\nshape, save where at intervals pints take the place of quarts; and the\r\nvisitor, gazing into the black depths of the transverse passages to\r\nthe right and left, becomes conscious of a feeling that if his guide\r\nwere suddenly to desert him, he would feel as hopelessly lost as in the\r\ncatacombs of Rome. There are two galleries, each 650 feet in length,\r\ncontaining about 650,000 bottles, and connected by 32 transverse\r\ngalleries, with an aggregate length of 4000 feet, in which nearly\r\n1,500,000 bottles are stored. There are, further, eight galleries, each\r\n500 feet in length, and proportionably stocked; also the extensive new\r\nvaults, excavated some five or six years back, in the rear of the then\r\nexisting cellarage, and a considerable number of smaller vaults. The\r\ndifferent depths and varying degrees of moisture afford a choice of\r\ntemperature of which the experienced owners know how to take advantage.\r\nThe original vaults, wherein more than a century ago the first bottles\r\nof Champagne made by the infant firm were stowed away, bear the name of\r\nSiberia, on account of their exceeding coldness. This section consists\r\nof several roughly-excavated low winding galleries, resembling natural\r\ncaverns, and affording a striking contrast to the broad, lofty, and\r\nregular-shaped corridors of more recent date.\r\n\r\nWhen the proper period arrives for the bottles to emerge once more into\r\nthe upper air, they are conveyed to the packing-room, a spacious hall\r\n180 feet long and 60 feet broad. In front of its three large double\r\ndoors wagons are drawn up ready to receive their loads. The 70 men and\r\nwomen employed here easily foil, label, wrap, and pack up some 10,000\r\nbottles a day. Cases and baskets are stacked in different parts of\r\nthis vast hall, at one end of which numerous trusses of straw used in\r\nthe packing are piled. Seated at tables ranged along one side of the\r\napartment women are busily occupied in pasting on labels or encasing\r\nthe necks of bottles in gold or silver foil, whilst elsewhere men,\r\nseated on three-legged stools in front of smoking caldrons of molten\r\nsealing-wax of a deep green hue, are coating the necks of other bottles\r\nby plunging them into the boiling fluid. When labelled and decorated\r\nwith either wax or foil, the bottles pass on to other women, who swathe\r\nthem in pink tissue-paper and set them aside for the packers, by whom,\r\nafter being deftly wrapped round with straw, they are consigned to\r\nbaskets or cases, to secure which last no less than 10,000 lb. of nails\r\nare annually used. England and Russia are partial to gold foil, pink\r\npaper, and wooden cases holding a dozen or a couple of dozen bottles\r\nof the exhilarating fluid, whereas other nations prefer waxed necks,\r\ndisdain pink paper, and insist on being supplied in wicker baskets\r\ncontaining fifty bottles each.\r\n\r\nSome idea of the complex character of so vast an establishment as that\r\nof Messrs. Moët & Chandon may be gathered from a mere enumeration of\r\ntheir staff, which, in addition to twenty clerks and 350 cellarmen\r\nproper, includes numerous agrafe-makers and corkcutters, packers and\r\ncarters, wheelwrights and saddlers, carpenters, masons, slaters and\r\ntilers, tinmen, firemen, needlewomen, &c., while the inventory of\r\nobjects used by this formidable array of workpeople comprises no fewer\r\nthan 1500 distinct heads. A medical man attached to the establishment\r\ngives gratuitous advice to all those employed, and a chemist dispenses\r\ndrugs and medicines without charge. While suffering from illness the\r\nmen receive half-pay, but should they be laid up by an accident met\r\nwith in the course of their work full salary is invariably awarded\r\nto them. As may be supposed, so vast an establishment as this is not\r\nwithout a provision for those past work, and all the old hands receive\r\nliberal pensions from the firm upon retiring.\r\n\r\nIt is needless to particularise Messrs. Moët & Chandon's wines, which\r\nare familiar to all drinkers of Champagne. Still it may be mentioned\r\nthat the great Epernay firm, with the view of meeting the requirements\r\nof the time, have lately commenced shipping a high-class _vin brut_, or\r\nnatural Champagne, possessing great vinosity, combined with remarkable\r\ndelicacy of flavour. To this fine dry wine the name of 'Brut Impérial'\r\nhas been given by the house. Moët & Chandon's famous 'Star' brand is\r\nknown in all societies, figures equally at clubs and mess-tables, at\r\ngarden-parties and picnics, dinners and _soirées_, and has its place in\r\nhotel _cartes_ all over the world. One of the best proofs of the wine's\r\nuniversal popularity is found in the circumstance that as many as a\r\nthousand visitors from all parts of the world come annually to Epernay\r\nand make the tour of Messrs. Moët & Chandon's spacious cellars.\r\n\r\nA little beyond Messrs. Moët & Chandon's, in the broad Rue du Commerce,\r\nwe encounter a heavy, ornate, pretentious-looking château, the\r\nresidence of the late M. Perrier-Jouët, presenting a striking contrast\r\nto the almost mean-looking premises opposite, where the business of the\r\nfirm is carried on. On the left-hand side of a courtyard surrounded by\r\nlow buildings, which serve as celliers, store-houses, packing-rooms,\r\nand the like, are the offices; and from an inner courtyard, where\r\npiles of bottles are stacked under open sheds, the cellars themselves\r\nare reached. Previous to descending into these we passed through the\r\nvarious buildings, in one of which a party of men were engaged in\r\ndisgorging and preparing wine for shipment. In another we noticed one\r\nof those heavy beam presses for pressing the grapes which the more\r\nintelligent manufacturers regard as obsolete, while in a third was the\r\ncuvée vat, holding no more than 2200 gallons. In making their cuvée\r\nthe firm commonly mix one part of old wine to three parts of new. An\r\nindifferent vintage, however, necessitates the admixture of a larger\r\nproportion of the older growth. The cellars, like all the more ancient\r\nones at Epernay, are somewhat straggling and irregular; still they are\r\nremarkably cool, and on the lower floor remarkably damp as well. This,\r\nhowever, would appear to be no disadvantage, as the breakage in them is\r\ncalculated never to exceed 2-1/2 per cent.\r\n\r\nThe firm have no less than five qualities of wine, and at one of the\r\nrecent Champagne competitions at London, where the experts engaged had\r\nno means of identifying the brands submitted to their judgment, Messrs.\r\nPerrier-Jouët's First Quality got classed below a cheaper wine of their\r\nneighbours, Messrs. Pol Roger & Co., and very considerably below the\r\nExtra Sec of Messrs. Périnet et fils, and inferior even to a wine of De\r\nVenoge's, the great Epernay manufacturer of common-class Champagne.\r\n\r\nChampagne establishments, combined with the handsome residences of the\r\nmanufacturers, line both sides of the long imposing Rue du Commerce at\r\nEpernay. On the left hand is a succession of fine châteaux, commencing\r\nwith one belonging to M. Auban Moët, whose terraced gardens overlook\r\nthe valley of the Marne, and command views of the vine-clad heights of\r\nCumières, Hautvillers, Ay, and Mareuil, and the more distant slopes\r\nof Ambonnay and Bouzy; while on the other side of the famous Epernay\r\nthoroughfare we encounter beyond the establishments of Messrs. Moët\r\n& Chandon and Perrier-Jouët the ornate monumental façade which the\r\nfirm of Piper & Co.--of whom Messrs. Kunkelmann & Co. are to-day the\r\nsuccessors--raised some years since above their extensive cellars. In a\r\nside street at the farther end of the Rue du Commerce stands a château\r\nof red brick, overlooking on the one side an extensive pleasure-garden,\r\nand on the other a spacious courtyard, bounded by celliers, stables,\r\nand bottle-sheds, all of modern construction and on a most extensive\r\nscale. These form the establishment of Messrs. Pol Roger & Co., settled\r\nfor many years at Epernay, and known throughout the Champagne for their\r\nlarge purchases at the epoch of the vintage. From the knowledge they\r\npossess of the best crus, and their relations with the leading vineyard\r\nproprietors, they are enabled whenever the wine is good to acquire\r\nlarge stocks of it. Having bottled a considerable quantity of the fine\r\nwine of 1874, they resolved to profit by the exceptional quality of\r\nthis vintage to commence shipping Champagne to England, where their\r\nagents, Messrs. Reuss, Lauteren, & Co., have successfully introduced\r\nthe new brand.\r\n\r\nPassing through a large open gateway, we enter the vast courtyard\r\nof the establishment, which, with arriving and departing carts--the\r\nfirst loaded with wine in cask or with new bottles, and the others\r\nwith cases of Champagne--presents rather an animated scene. Under a\r\nroof projecting from the wall of the vast cellier on the right hand a\r\ntribe of 'Sparnaciennes'--as the feminine inhabitants of Epernay are\r\ntermed--are occupied in washing bottles in readiness for the coming\r\ntirage. The surrounding buildings, most substantially constructed, are\r\nnot destitute of architectural pretensions.\r\n\r\nThe extensive cellier, the area of which is 23,589 square feet, is\r\nunderstood to be the largest single construction of the kind in the\r\nChampagne district. Built entirely of iron, stone, and brick, its\r\nframework is a perfect marvel of lightness. The roof, consisting of\r\nrows of brick arches, is covered above with a layer of Portland cement,\r\nin order to keep it cool in summer and protect it against the winter\r\ncold, two most desirable objects in connection with the manipulation\r\nof Champagne. Here an endless chain of a new pattern enables wine in\r\nbottle to be lowered and raised with great rapidity to or from the\r\ncellars beneath--lofty and capacious excavations of two stories, the\r\nlower one of which is reached by a flight of no less than 170 steps.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: COURTYARD OF MESSRS. POL ROGER AND CO.'S ESTABLISHMENT\r\nAT EPERNAY.]\r\n\r\nLess than a couple of miles southward of Epernay, on the high-road to\r\nTroyes, is the village of Pierry, which, unlike most of the Champagne\r\nvillages, is one of those happy spots with little or no history.\r\nUp to the close of the seventeenth century it was an insignificant\r\nhamlet; but at that epoch--when Dom Perignon's discovery gave such\r\nan impetus to the viticultural industry of the Marne--the waste land\r\nlying around it was broken up and planted with vines, and a number\r\nof rich strangers, chiefly from Epernay, built themselves houses and\r\nvendangeoirs here, and contributed to the erection of the church. The\r\nBenedictines of St.-Pierre-aux-Monts at Châlons, who continued to be\r\nthe titular seigneurs of Pierry up to the period of the Revolution,\r\nwere not behindhand in attention to their vines, and during the early\r\npart of the eighteenth century the wine vintaged in their Clos St.\r\nPierre, under the fostering care of Brother Jean Oudart--whose renown\r\nalmost equalled that of Perignon himself--was very highly esteemed.[449]\r\n\r\nDuring the eighteenth century Pierry continued to be a favourite\r\nresidence of well-to-do landowners,[450] and was further embellished by\r\nthe construction of numerous handsome châteaux, the most interesting,\r\nfrom a historic point of view, being that formerly belonging to\r\nCazotte.[451] It was here that the ex-Commissary General of the navy\r\ncomposed the greater part of his works, and elaborated that futile\r\nscheme for the escape of Louis XVI. after Varennes, which was to\r\nconduct its author to the scaffold.[452]\r\n\r\nThe visionary dreamer, to whom we owe the _Diable Amoureux_, appears at\r\nPierry in the triple character of a practical viticulturist, a village\r\nHampden withstanding with dauntless breast that little tyrant of the\r\nsurrounding vineyards--the Abbot of Hautvillers,[453] and a local\r\nlegislator put forward in the proprietarial interest at the outbreak of\r\nthat Revolution[454] which he appears to have foreseen, if not to have\r\ndirectly prophesied, as he has been credited with doing.[455]\r\n\r\nAmongst the most imposing of the remaining Pierry châteaux is the one\r\nsituate in that part of the village known as Corrigot, and now in the\r\noccupation of Messrs. Gé-Dufaut & Co. Its grandiose aspect, various\r\ncourts, charming garden, fine trees, and clear lake justify this firm\r\nin adopting, in combination with an anchor, the title Château de\r\nPierry as the brand of their wine. Prior to the Revolution the château\r\nbelonged to M. de Papillon de Sannois, a fermier-général of that\r\nperiod. The municipal records of Pierry contain a petition addressed\r\nby him to the authorities in 1791, at a time when a panic prevailed\r\nrespecting the forestallers of corn, begging them to institute a formal\r\nsearch throughout his residence, in order to give the lie to the\r\nrumours accusing him of having bought up and stored away a considerable\r\nquantity of wheat. The municipality accepted his invitation, and the\r\nresult was a certificate to the effect that the total amount of wheat\r\nand oats stored there only represented three months' consumption for\r\nthe household.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Gé-Dufaut & Co. are the owners of vineyards both in Pierry\r\nand the neighbouring parts, and for upwards of thirty years the\r\nfirm have been engaged in preparing and shipping Champagnes. Their\r\ncellars, excavated in the mingled stone, chalk, and earth which form\r\nthe prevailing soil of the district, extend beneath the vineyards\r\nbelonging to the firm, and are walled and vaulted throughout. The\r\ncircumstance of their being on one level, slightly below the celliers\r\nof the establishment, is a great convenience as regards the various\r\nmanipulations which the wine has to undergo. Considerable reserves of\r\nold wines of the best years are stored in these vaults. The cultivation\r\nof the vineyards owned by the firm, and the pressing, maturing, and\r\ngeneral cellar management of their wines are under the personal\r\nsuperintendence of the various partners, with a highly satisfactory\r\nresult, as is proved by the first-class medal secured by the firm at\r\nthe Vienna Exhibition of 1873, and the gold medal awarded to them at\r\nthe Paris Exhibition of 1878. Messrs. Gé-Dufaut & Co. ship their wines\r\nto Europe, America, and India, and more especially to England, where\r\ntheir dry, natural, and unalcoholised Champagne has acquired a deserved\r\nreputation. The firm, moreover, are the officially appointed furnishers\r\nof Champagne to the Courts of Italy and Spain.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHÂTEAU OF PIERRY, THE PROPERTY OF MESSRS.

The road lies\r\nacross the light bridge spanning the Marne canal, the tall trees\r\nfringing which hide for a time the clustering houses; still we catch\r\nsight of the steeple of the antique church, relieved by a background of\r\nvine-covered slopes, and of an eighteenth-century château rising above\r\na mass of foliage. Perched half-way up the slope, covered with 'golden\r\nplants,' which rises in the rear of the village, the château, with its\r\nlong façade of windows, commands the valley of the Marne for miles;\r\nand from the stately-terraced walk, planted with ancient lime-trees,\r\ngeometrically clipped in the fashion of the last century, a splendid\r\nview of the distant vineyards of Avize, Cramant, Epernay, and Chouilly\r\nis obtained. The château formed one of a quartette of seignorial\r\nresidences which, at the commencement of the present century, belonged\r\nto Balthazar Constance Dangé-Dorçay, whose ancestors had been lords of\r\nChouilly under the _ancien régime_. Dorçay had inherited from an aunt\r\nthe châteaux of Ay, Mareuil, Boursault, and Chouilly, together with a\r\nlarge patrimony in land and money; but a mania for gambling brought\r\nhim to utter ruin, and he dispossessed himself of money, lands, and\r\nchâteaux in succession, and was reduced, in his old age, to earn a\r\nmeagre pittance as a violin-player at the Paris Opera-house. The old\r\nchâteau of Boursault, which still exists contiguous to the stately\r\nedifice raised by Madame Clicquot on the summit of the hill, was risked\r\nand lost on a single game at cards by this pertinacious gamester, whose\r\npressing pecuniary difficulties compelled him to sell the remaining\r\nchâteaux one by one. That of Ay was purchased by M. Froc de la Boulaye,\r\nand by him bequeathed to his cousin the Count de Mareuil, whose son is\r\nto-day a partner in the Champagne house of Ayala & Co.\r\n\r\nThe wine of Ay, from an early date, has found equal favour in the\r\neyes of poets and princes. Eustache Deschamps sang its praises in\r\nthe fourteenth century, and was echoed a hundred years later by the\r\nanonymous author of the _Eglogue sur le Retour de Bacchus_.[456]\r\nSigismund of Bohemia, the betrayer of John Huss, on visiting France\r\nin 1410, desired to pass through Ay in order to taste the wine at the\r\nplace of its production.[457] Leo X., Charles V., Francis III., and our\r\nown Henry VIII., each had a house in or near Ay; 'for amongst all the\r\ngreat affairs of state which these princes had to unravel, supplying\r\nthemselves with this vintage was not the least of their cares.'[458]\r\nMalicious tongues have asserted that they were somewhat suspicious\r\nof the honesty of the wine-growers of the district, and, in order to\r\nsecure a genuine article, deemed it needful to have a commissioner\r\nor agent resident on the spot, to superintend the making of the wine\r\nset apart for their own consumption.[459] Tradition still points out,\r\non the right of the road from Dizy to Ay, a vineyard called Le Léon,\r\nas the one whence the Pope derived his wine, though no traces remain\r\nof the vendangeoir built by the Emperor in a coppice above Ay during\r\nthe siege of Epernay in 1544, and still standing in 1727.[460] The\r\npresident Bertin du Rocheret has celebrated the partiality of a couple\r\nof these potentates for the wine of Ay in some triolets addressed to M.\r\nde Senécé, and published in the _Mercure_ in 1728:\r\n\r\n    'Ay produces the best wine--\r\n        I call the world to witness this;\r\n    Though you may for Reims opine,\r\n    Ay produces the best wine.\r\n    It ranks the first, and the most fine\r\n        St. Evremond has said it is.\r\n    Ay produces the best wine--\r\n        I call the world to witness this.\r\n\r\n    Charles the Fifth was well aware\r\n        Of this--far better than his friend\r\n    Adrian in the papal chair;\r\n    Charles the Fifth was well aware\r\n    Of this, and so, to get his share,\r\n        Sought in France his days to end.\r\n    Charles the Fifth was well aware\r\n        Of this--far better than his friend.\r\n\r\n    Lest some fraud the juice should mix,\r\n        And his table thus disgrace,\r\n    He would his own vintage fix,\r\n    Lest some fraud the juice should mix.\r\n    Leo, fearing the like tricks,\r\n        Bought in Ay a pressing-place,\r\n    Lest some fraud the juice should mix,\r\n        And his table thus disgrace.'[461]\r\n\r\nThe wine of Ay ranked at the court of Charles IX. as 'a very pleasant\r\nand noble wine;'[462] and even that bigoted uprooter of vines and\r\nheresy had a vendangeoir in this stronghold of Protestantism,[463]\r\nwhich the Catholics of the Champagne marched against, singing--\r\n\r\n    'Parpaillot d'Ay,\r\n        T'es bien misérable,\r\n    T'as quitté ton Di\r\n        Pour servir le diable;\r\n    Tu n'auras ni chien, ni chat,\r\n    Pour te chanter Libera,\r\n    Et tu mourras mau-chrétien,\r\n    Toi qu'a maudit Saint Trézain.'[464]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: HENRI III.\r\n\r\n(From a painting of the period).]\r\n\r\nIn the reign of Henri III. the wines of Ay--'claret and yellowish,\r\nsubtile, fine, and in taste very pleasing to the palate, ... yet\r\ntherewithal such wines as the Greeks call Oligophora, and as will not\r\nadmit the mixture of much water'[465]--were 'eagerly sought after\r\nfor the use of kings, princes, and great lords.'[466] At a time when\r\nthe bulk of the vintage of Burgundy was denounced as rough, sour,\r\nand harsh; and that of Bordeaux stigmatised as thick and black; and\r\nwhen good and bad years were allowed to have a considerable influence\r\nupon the growths of the Isle of France, the Orleannais, and Anjou, it\r\nwas admitted that 'the wines of Ay do, for the most part, hold the\r\nfirst and principal place, ... and are, in all good and evil years,\r\nfound better than any others.'[467] The kings and princes of the day\r\nmade the wines of Ay their ordinary drink.[468] They flowed freely\r\nin the scandalous orgies with which the French Heliogabalus and his\r\n_mignons_ alternated their pious flagellations and solemn processions,\r\nand mantled in the beakers over which the chiefs of the League sat in\r\ndark and solemn conclave; they were quaffed by the Béarnais to the\r\nbright eyes of the fair De Saulve, and cheered the nightly vigils of\r\nCatherine de Medicis and Ruggieri; they sharpened the biting wit of\r\nChicot, and spurred the plotting spirit of Francis of Anjou. Guise\r\nand Crillon, Joyeuse and D'Epernon, Mayenne and D'Aubigné made common\r\ncause in recognising their merits; Quelus and Maugiron may have quaffed\r\na goblet before setting forth on their fatal journey to the Barrière\r\nSaint Antoine; and a cup, filled by the fair hands of the Duchess\r\nde Montpensier, may have fired the brain and nerved the arm of the\r\nregicide Jacques Clément.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: OLD HOUSE AT AY, KNOWN AS THE VENDANGEOIR OF HENRI\r\nQUATRE.]\r\n\r\nHenri Quatre boasted the merits of his vineyard at Prepaton, near\r\nVendôme, when he was only King of Navarre,[469] and delighted in the\r\nwine of Arbois.[470] At Ay, within a few yards of the church, there\r\nis a quaint old timber house traditionally known as the 'vendangeoir\r\nd'Henri Quatre,' with obliterated carved escutcheons on the pillars\r\nof its doorway. In this dilapidated yet interesting structure we\r\nhave a mute but certain testimony to the King's appreciation of the\r\nwine of Ay, if not a confirmation of the truth of the assertion that\r\nHenri was as proud of his title of Seigneur d'Ay as of that of King\r\nof France.[471] Giving an audience to the Spanish ambassador, and\r\nirritated at the long list of titles appended by the punctilious\r\nhidalgo to his royal master's name, he exclaimed: 'You will say to his\r\nHighness Philip, King of Spain and the Indies, Castille, Leon, Arragon,\r\nMurcia, and the Balearic Isles, that Henri, Sieur of Ay and of Gonesse\r\n...,' being the places producing the best wine and the whitest bread in\r\nFrance.[472] When encamped at Damery, during the siege of Epernay, this\r\nfavourite beverage, and the smiles of the fair Anne Dudey, Présidente\r\ndu Puy, helped to relieve the tedium of campaigning; for, as Bertin du\r\nRocheret has sung,\r\n\r\n    'Our great Henry, king benign,\r\n        With it cheered his \"belle hôtesse.\"\r\n    When at Damery he'd dine,\r\n    Our great Henry, king benign,\r\n    Chose it for his favourite wine;\r\n        And for bread, that of Gonesse\r\n    Our great Henry, king benign,\r\n        With it cheered his \"belle hôtesse.\"'[473]\r\n\r\nWith the vintage of Ay in such universal esteem, it is scarcely to\r\nbe wondered at that Dominicus Baudius, professor of eloquence at\r\nthe University of Leyden and historiographer to the States of the\r\nNetherlands, should, in the fulness of his admiration, have declared to\r\nhis friend the Président du Thou that instead of _vin d'Ay_ it ought to\r\nbe called _vinum Dei_.[474]\r\n\r\nOlivier de Serres, the French Tusser, praises this divine liquor.[475]\r\nThe anonymous author of the _Hercule Guepin_, a poem penned at the\r\ncommencement of the seventeenth century in honour of the wine of\r\nOrleans, is forced to acknowledge the merits of that of Ay;[476] and\r\nthat indefatigable commentator, the Abbé de Marolles, in a note to his\r\nedition of Martial, classes the growths of Ay, Avenay, and Epernay\r\namongst the best that France produced. 'Vive le bon vin d'Ay!' exclaims\r\nGuy Patin enthusiastically; and that strange compound of the wit and\r\nthe philosopher, St. Evremond, has extolled its qualities in prose\r\nand verse.[477] 'If you ask me which wine of all others I prefer,' he\r\nwrites from London to the Count d'Olonne, about 1671, 'without yielding\r\nto tastes introduced by people of sham daintiness, I will answer that\r\ngood wine of Ay is the most natural of all wines, the most healthy, the\r\nbest purified from all earth smack; of a most exquisite charm, through\r\nthe peach flavour which is peculiar to it; and is, in my opinion, the\r\nfinest of all flavours.'[478]\r\n\r\nIt is improbable that the wine of Ay of Francis I., or of Henri Quatre,\r\nwas _mousseux_, for had it been so history would have mentioned it. In\r\ngood years the still wine of Ay has a bouquet and perfume sufficient to\r\naccount for its ancient reputation. Neither was the wine St. Evremond\r\npreferred sparkling, though his reference to the taste introduced by\r\nsham _gourmets_ points probably to the custom of drinking the wine\r\nbefore its fermentation was completed, or else to the practice of icing\r\nit. When once, however, the introduction of _vin mousseux_ added a new\r\ncharm to the pleasures of the table, the poets who sang the praises\r\nof the foaming nectar seem one and all to have celebrated it as the\r\n'pétillant Ay,' and to have chosen, perhaps for euphonistic reasons,\r\nthat spot as its birthplace.[479] The material results were equally\r\nsatisfactory; for Arthur Young mentions that when, on July 8, 1787, he\r\nvisited 'Ay, a village not far out on the road to Reims very famous\r\nfor its wines,' he was provided with a letter for M. Lasnier, who\r\nhad 60,000 bottles in his cellar, whilst M. Dorsé had from 30,000 to\r\n40,000.[480]\r\n\r\nA century ago the foregoing were no doubt considered large stocks, but\r\nto-day the very smallest of the Ay firms would think itself poorly\r\nprovided if its cellars contained under quadruple this quantity. The\r\nlargest Champagne establishment at Ay is that of Messrs. Deutz &\r\nGeldermann, whose extra dry 'Gold Lack' and 'Cabinet' Champagnes have\r\nlong been favourably known in England, through the energetic exertions\r\nof their agents, Messrs. J. R. Parkington & Co., of Crutched Friars.\r\nThe Ay firm have their offices in a massive-looking corner-house at\r\nthe further extremity of the town, in the direction of the steep hills\r\nsheltering it on the north. This forms their central establishment,\r\nand here are spacious celliers for disgorging and finishing off the\r\nwine, a large packing-hall, and rooms where bales of corks and other\r\naccessories of the trade are stored, the operations of making the\r\ncuvées and bottling being accomplished in an establishment some little\r\ndistance off.\r\n\r\nOn proceeding thither, we find an elegant château with a charming\r\nterraced garden, lying at the very foot of the vine-clad slopes, and on\r\nthe opposite side of the road some large celliers where wine in wood is\r\nstored, and where the cuvées of the firm, consisting usually of upwards\r\nof 50,000 gallons each, are made in a vat of gigantic proportions,\r\nfurnished with a raised platform at one end for the accommodation\r\nof the workman who agitates the customary paddles. When the wine\r\nis completely blended it is drawn off into casks disposed for the\r\npurpose in the cellar below, as shown in the accompanying engraving,\r\nand after being fined it rests for about a month to clear itself. To\r\neach of these casks of newly-blended wine a portion of old wine is\r\nadded separately, and at the moment of bottling the whole is newly\r\namalgamated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DRAWING OFF THE CUVÉE AT DEUTZ AND GELDERMANN'S, AY.]\r\n\r\nAdjoining M. Deutz's château is the principal entrance to the extensive\r\ncellars of the firm, to which, at our visit in 1877, considerable\r\nadditions were being made. In excavating these cellars in the chalk a\r\nuniform system is pursued. The workmen commence by rounding off the\r\nroof of the gallery, and then proceed to work gradually downwards,\r\nextracting the chalk, whenever practicable, in blocks suitable for\r\nbuilding purposes, which, being worth from three to four shillings\r\nthe square yard, help to reduce the cost of the excavation. When any\r\nserious flaws present themselves in the sides or roof of the galleries,\r\nthey are invariably made good with masonry.\r\n\r\nThis splendid range of cellars now comprises eight long and lofty\r\ngalleries no less than seventeen feet wide, and the same number of feet\r\nin height, and of the aggregate length of 2200 yards. These spacious\r\nvaults, which run parallel with each other, and communicate by means of\r\ncross passages, underlie the street, the château, the garden, and the\r\nvineyard slopes beyond, and possess the great advantage of being always\r\ndry. They are capable, we were informed, of containing several million\r\nbottles of Champagne, in addition to a large quantity of wine in cask.\r\n\r\nMessrs. Deutz & Geldermann possess vineyards at Ay, and own a large\r\nvendangeoir at Verzenay, where in good years they usually press 500\r\npièces of wine. They, moreover, make large purchases of grapes at\r\nBouzy, Cramant, Le Mesnil, Pierry, &c., and invariably have these\r\npressed under their own superintendence. Beyond large shipments to\r\nEngland, where their wine is deservedly held in high estimation,\r\nMessrs. Deutz & Geldermann transact a considerable business with other\r\ncountries, and more especially with Germany, in which country their\r\nbrand has been for years one of the most popular, while to-day it is\r\nthe favourite at numerous regimental messes and the principal hotels.\r\n\r\nWithin a hundred yards of the open space, surrounded by houses of\r\ndifferent epochs and considerable diversity of design, where the\r\nAy market-hall stands, and in one of those narrow winding streets\r\ncommon to the town, an escutcheon, with a bunch of grapes for device,\r\nsurmounting a lofty gateway, attracts attention. Beyond, a trim\r\ncourtyard, girt round with orange-trees in bright green boxes, and\r\nclipped in orthodox fashion, affords access to the handsome residence\r\nand offices of M. Duminy, well known in England and America as a\r\nshipper of high-class Champagnes, and whose Parisian connection is\r\nextensive. On the right-hand side of the courtyard is the packing-room;\r\nand through the cellars, which have an entrance here, one can reach\r\nthe celliers in an adjoining street, where the cuvée is made and the\r\nbottling of the wine accomplished.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE EXCAVATION OF DEUTZ AND GELDERMANN'S NEW CELLARS AT\r\nAY.]\r\n\r\nM. Duminy's cellars are remarkably old, and consequently of somewhat\r\nirregular construction, being at times rather low and narrow, as well\r\nas on different levels. In addition, however, to these venerable\r\nvaults, packed with wines of 1874 and '78, M. Duminy has a new and\r\nextensive establishment on the outskirts of Ay, as well as various\r\nsubterranean adjuncts in the town itself. This new establishment, which\r\nstands under the vineclad slope, and merely a stone's throw from the\r\nrailway line to Reims, consists of a large ornamental building looking\r\non to a spacious courtyard ordinarily alive with busy workpeople. In\r\naddition to the pavilion already erected, it is intended to construct\r\none of similar design, and to connect the two with a monumental tower.\r\nThe requisite land has already been purchased, the architectural plans\r\nare prepared, and the work is now in active progress.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nEntering the courtyard of which we have spoken, we notice the new\r\noffices of the firm on the left hand, and extending along the wall\r\nbeyond is a long zinc-roofed shed, crowded with baskets filled with\r\nnewly-purchased Champagne bottles. On the opposite side of the\r\ncourtyard is a building in which the operation of bottle-washing is\r\ncarried on. The pavilion in the rear of the courtyard is of somewhat\r\nmonumental proportions, and is ornamented with dressings of white\r\nstone and red brick. Entering through the principal doorway, we find\r\nourselves in a vast cellier, where the packing operations are carried\r\non, and where are a couple of huge tuns in which the cuvées of the\r\nhouse are made. A stone staircase conducts to an upper cellier, where\r\nseveral hundred casks of _vin brut_ are stored, and for the raising\r\nor lowering of which lifts are provided at stated distances. In an\r\napartment above this second cellier straw envelopes for bottles and\r\nother accessories employed in the trade are kept.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: M. DUMINY'S NEW ESTABLISHMENT AT AY.]\r\n\r\nThe cellars extend, not merely beneath this large building and the\r\ncourtyard in front, but run under the adjacent mountain-slope. They\r\ncomprise four galleries on the same level, vaulted and faced with brick\r\nor stone, each gallery being about 500 feet in length and upwards of\r\ntwelve feet in width and height. Eight transverse passages connect\r\nthese galleries with each other, and numerous lifts communicate with\r\nthe cellier and the courtyard above. The galleries that run under\r\nthe vineyard slope are ventilated by shafts no less than 120 feet in\r\nheight. M. Duminy has already provided room here for a million bottles\r\nof sparkling wine; and it is estimated that, when the establishment\r\nis completed, two and a half millions of bottles can be stored here\r\nin addition to the stock contained in the old cellars possessed by M.\r\nDuminy in the town. During its two-thirds of a century of existence\r\nthe house has invariably confined itself to first-class wines, taking\r\nparticular pride in shipping fully-matured growths. Besides its own\r\nlarge reserve of these, it holds considerable stocks long since\r\ndisposed of, and now merely awaiting the purchasers' orders to be\r\nshipped.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nA few paces beyond M. Duminy's we come upon an antiquated,\r\ndecrepit-looking timber house, with its ancient gable bulging over as\r\nthough the tough oak brackets on which it rests were at last grown\r\nweary of supporting their unwieldy burden. Judging from the quaint\r\ncarved devices on the timbers at the lower portions of this building,\r\none may imagine it to have been the residence of an individual of some\r\nimportance in the days when the principal European potentates had their\r\ncommissioners installed at Ay to secure them the finest vintages. The\r\nhouse evidently dates back to this or to an earlier epoch.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: ANCIENT TIMBER HOUSE AT AY.]\r\n\r\nThe cellars of Messrs. Pfungst Frères et Cie. are situated some little\r\ndistance from the vineyard owned by them at Ay. The firm lay themselves\r\nout exclusively for the shipment of high-class Champagne, and the\r\nexcellent growths of this district necessarily form an important\r\nelement in their carefully-composed cuvées. A considerable portion\r\nof their stock consists of reserves of old wine of grand years; and\r\na variety of samples of finely-matured Champagnes were submitted to\r\nour judgment. All of these wines were of superior quality, combining\r\ndelicacy and fragrance with dryness, the latter being their especial\r\nfeature. In addition to their business with England, where the brand\r\nof the firm is rapidly increasing in popularity among connoisseurs of\r\nmatured wines, Messrs. Pfungst Frères ship largely to India and the\r\nUnited States.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CAPITALS AND MOULDINGS IN AY CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nOn the northern side of the town stands the handsome Gothic church\r\nof Ay, dating from about the middle of the fifteenth century. The\r\nexisting building replaced the edifice erected some two hundred years\r\npreviously, and traces of which are still to be seen in the present\r\ntransept. The stone tower, which is in striking contrast with the other\r\nportions of the structure, bears the date 1541 on its western face.\r\nThis tower and the interior of the church were greatly damaged by\r\nthe fire--traditionally ascribed to lightning--which occurred at the\r\nclose of the sixteenth century, and the former had to be strengthened\r\nby filling up the arched windows and by the addition of buttresses.\r\nThe bell, whose terrible tocsin used to warn good citizens that\r\nthe _patrie_ was in danger in the days of the Revolution, when the\r\nchurch was converted into a Temple of Reason, had previously swung\r\nin the abbey of Hautvillers, and may have summoned the vintagers to\r\nlabour as well as the faithful to prayer. From 1867 to 1877 extensive\r\ninterior repairs and restorations, costing upwards of 6000_l._, greatly\r\ntransformed the interior of the church. Care was, however, taken to\r\npreserve the numerous bits of mediæval and Renaissance sculpture with\r\nwhich both the interior and exterior of the edifice were studded.\r\nIn many of the ornamental mouldings, as well as the capitals of the\r\ncolumns, grape-laden vine-branches had been freely introduced, as if\r\nto indicate the honour in which the vine, the material source of all\r\nthe prosperity enjoyed by the little town, was held both by mediæval\r\nand later architects; and these appear all to have been scrupulously\r\nrestored. One of the most characteristic decorations of this character\r\nis the sculptured figure of a boy bearing a basket of grapes upon his\r\nhead, which surmounts the handsome Renaissance doorway.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MOULDINGS FROM AY CHURCH.]\r\n\r\nWithin half an hour's walk of Ay, in an easterly direction, is the\r\nvillage of Mareuil, a long straight street of straggling houses,\r\nbounded by trees and garden-plots, with vine-clad hills rising abruptly\r\nbehind on the one side, and the Marne canal flowing placidly by on\r\nthe other. The archaic church, a mixture of the Romanesque and Early\r\nGothic, stands at the farther end of the village, and some little\r\ndistance on this side of it is a massive-looking eighteenth-century\r\nbuilding, spacious enough to accommodate a regiment of horse, but\r\nconventual rather than barrack-like in aspect, from the paucity of\r\nwindows looking on to the road. A broad gateway leads into a spacious\r\ncourtyard, to the left of which stands a grand château; while on the\r\nright there rises an ornate round tower of three stories, from the\r\ngallery on the summit of which a fine view over the valley of the\r\nMarne is obtained. The buildings, enclosing the court on three sides,\r\ncomprise press-houses, celliers, and packing-rooms, an antiquated\r\nsun-dial marking the hour on the blank space above the vines that\r\nclimb beside the entrance gateway. The more ancient of these tenements\r\nformed the vendangeoir of the Dukes of Orleans at the time they owned\r\nthe château of Mareuil, purchased in 1830 by the Duke de Montebello,\r\nson of the famous Marshal Lannes, and minister and ambassador of Louis\r\nPhilippe and Napoleon III.\r\n\r\nThe acquisition of this property, to which were attached some\r\nimportant vineyards, led, several years later, to the duke's founding,\r\nin conjunction with his brothers, the Marquis and General Count de\r\nMontebello, a Champagne firm, whose brand speedily acquired a notable\r\npopularity. To-day the business is carried on by their sons and heirs,\r\nfor all the original partners in the house have followed their valiant\r\nfather to the grave. Struck down by an Austrian cannon-ball in the\r\nzenith of his fame, the career of Marshal Lannes, brief as it was,\r\nfurnishes one of the most brilliant pages in French military annals.\r\nJoining the army of Italy as a volunteer in 1796, he was made a colonel\r\non the battle-field in the gorges of Millesimo, when Augereau's bold\r\nadvance opened Piedmont to the French. He fought at Bassano and Lodi,\r\ntook part in the assault of Pavia and the siege of Mantua, and at\r\nArcola, when Napoleon dashed flag in hand upon the bridge, Lannes\r\nwas seriously wounded whilst shielding his general from danger. He\r\nafterwards distinguished himself in Egypt, and led the van of the\r\nFrench army across the Alps, displaying his accustomed bravery both at\r\nMontebello and Marengo. At Austerlitz, where he commanded the right\r\nwing of the army, he greatly contributed to the victory; and at Jena,\r\nFriedland, and Eylau his valour was again conspicuous. Sent to Spain,\r\nhe defeated the Spaniards at Tudela, and took part in the operations\r\nagainst Saragossa. Wounded at the battle of Essling, when the Archduke\r\nCharles inflicted upon Napoleon I. the first serious repulse he had\r\nmet with on the field of battle, the valiant Lannes expired a few days\r\nafterwards in the Emperor's arms.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE MONTEBELLO ESTABLISHMENT AT MAREUIL.]\r\n\r\nWe were met at Mareuil, on the occasion of our visit, by Count\r\nAlfred Ferdinand de Montebello, the present manager of the house,\r\nand conducted by him over the establishment. In the press-house, to\r\nthe left of the courtyard, were two of the ponderous presses used\r\nin the Champagne, for, like all other large firms, the house makes\r\nits own wine. Grapes grown in the Mareuil vineyards arrive here in\r\nbaskets slung over the backs of mules, muzzled, so that while awaiting\r\ntheir loads they may not devour the fruit within reach. In a cellier\r\nadjoining the press-house stands a large vat, capable of holding fifty\r\npièces of wine, with a crane beside it for hauling up the casks when\r\nthe cuvée is made. Here the tirage likewise takes place; and in the\r\nrange of buildings roofed with glass, in the rear of the tower, the\r\nbottled wine is labelled, capped with foil, and packed in cases for\r\ntransmission to Paris, England, and other places abroad.\r\n\r\nA double flight of steps, decorated with lamps and vases, leads to\r\nthe handsome offices of the firm, situated on the first-floor of the\r\ntower; while above is an apartment with a panelled ceiling, gracefully\r\ndecorated with groups of Cupids engaged in the vintage and the various\r\noperations which the famous wines of the Mountain and the River undergo\r\nduring their conversion into Champagne. On the ground-floor of the\r\ntower a low doorway conducts to the spacious cellars, which, owing\r\nto the proximity of the Marne, are all on the same level as well as\r\nconstructed in masonry. The older vaults, where the Marquis de Pange,\r\na former owner of the château, stored the wine which he used to sell\r\nto the Champagne manufacturers, are somewhat low and tortuous compared\r\nwith the broad and lofty galleries of more recent date, which have\r\nbeen constructed as the growing connection of the firm obliged them to\r\nincrease their stocks. Spite, however, of numerous additions, portions\r\nof their reserves have to be stored in other cellars in Mareuil.\r\nConsiderable stocks of each of the four qualities of wine supplied by\r\nthe firm are being got ready for disgorgement, including Cartes Noires\r\nand Bleues, with the refined Carte Blanche and the delicate Crêmant,\r\nwhich challenge comparison with brands of the highest repute.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CHÂTEAU OF MAREUIL, BELONGING TO THE DUKE OF MONTEBELLO.]\r\n\r\nIn the adjacent château, the gardens of which slope down to the Marne\r\ncanal, there are various interesting portraits, with one or two relics\r\nof the distinguished founder of the Montebello family, notably Marshal\r\nLannes's gold-embroidered velvet saddle trappings, his portrait and\r\nthat of Marshal Gerard, as well as one of Napoleon I., by David, with\r\na handsome clock and candelabra of Egyptian design, a bust of Augustus\r\nCæsar, and a portrait of the Regent d'Orleans.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: GENERAL VIEW OF AVIZE.]\r\n\r\n                                 XII.\r\n\r\n            /Champagne Establishments at Avize and Rilly./\r\n\r\n    Avize the centre of the white grape district--Its situation and\r\n    aspect--The establishment of Giesler & Co.--The tirage and the\r\n    cuvée--Vin Brut in racks and on tables--The packing-hall, the\r\n    extensive cellars, and the disgorging cellier--Bottle stores and\r\n    bottle-washing machines--Messrs.

Avize can scarcely be styled a\r\ntown, and yet its growing proportions are beyond those of an ordinary\r\nvillage. It lies pleasantly nestled among the vines, sheltered by bold\r\nridges on the north-west, with the monotonous plains of La Champagne\r\npouilleuse, unsuited to the cultivation of the vine, stretching away\r\neastward in the direction of Châlons. Avize cannot pretend to the same\r\nantiquity as its neighbour Vertus, and lacks the many picturesque\r\nvestiges of which the latter can boast. Its church dates back only to\r\nthe fifteenth century, although the principal doorway in the Romanesque\r\nstyle evidently belongs to a much earlier epoch. There is a general\r\nair of trim prosperity about the place, and the villagers have that\r\nwell-to-do appearance common to the inhabitants of the French wine\r\ndistricts. Only at vintage-time, however, are there any particular\r\noutdoor signs of activity, although half a score of Champagne firms\r\nhave their establishments here, giving employment to the bulk of the\r\npopulation, and sending forth their two or three million bottles of the\r\nsparkling wine of the Marne annually.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: MAKING THE CUVÉE AT MESSRS. GIESLER'S, AT AVIZE.]\r\n\r\nProceeding along the straight level road leading from the station to\r\nthe village, we encounter on our right hand the premises of Messrs.\r\nGiesler & Co., the reputation of whose brand is universal. When M.\r\nGiesler quitted the firm of P. A. Mumm, Giesler, & Co., at Reims,\r\nin 1838, he removed to Avize, and founded the present extensive\r\nestablishment. Entering through a large open gateway, we find\r\nourselves within a spacious courtyard, with a handsome dwelling-house\r\nin the rear, and all the signs of a Champagne business of magnitude\r\napparent. A spiral staircase conducts to the counting-house on the\r\nfirst story of a range of buildings on the left hand, the ground floor\r\nof which is divided into celliers. Passing through a door by the\r\nside of this staircase, we enter a large hall where the operation of\r\nbottling the wine is going on. Four tuns, each holding five ordinary\r\npièces of wine, and raised upon large blocks of wood, are standing\r\nhere, and communicating with them are bottling syphons of the type\r\ncommonly employed in the Champagne. Messrs. Giesler do not usually\r\nconsign the newly-bottled wine at once to the cellars, but retain\r\nit above-ground for about a fortnight, in order that it may develop\r\nits effervescent qualities more perfectly. We find many thousands of\r\nthese bottles stacked horizontally in the adjoining celliers, in one\r\nof which stands the great cuvée tun, wherein some fifty hogsheads of\r\nthe finest Champagne growths are blended together at one time, two\r\nhundred hogsheads being thus mingled daily while the cuvées are in\r\nprogress. The casks of wine having been hoisted from the cellars to\r\nthe first floor by a crane, and run on to a trough, their bungs are\r\nremoved, and the wine flows through an aperture in the floor into the\r\nhuge tun beneath, its amalgamation being accomplished by the customary\r\nfan-shaped appliances, set in motion by the turning of a wheel. In an\r\nadjacent room is the machine used for mixing the liqueur which Messrs.\r\nGiesler add so sparingly to their light and fragrant wines.\r\n\r\nThere are a couple of floors above these celliers, the uppermost\r\nof which is used as a general store, while in the one beneath many\r\nthousands of bottles of _vin brut_ repose _sur pointe_, either in racks\r\nor on tables, as at the Clicquot-Werlé establishment. This latter\r\nsystem requires ample space, for as the workman who shakes the bottles\r\nis only able to use one hand, the operation of dislodging the sediment\r\nnecessarily occupies a much longer time than is requisite when the\r\nbottles rest in racks.\r\n\r\nThe buildings on the opposite side of the courtyard comprise a\r\nlarge packing-hall, celliers where the wine is finished off, and\r\nrooms where corks and suchlike things are stored. Here, too, is the\r\nentrance to the cellars, of which there are three tiers, all lofty\r\nand well-ventilated galleries, very regular in their construction,\r\nand faced with either stone or brick. In these extensive vaults are\r\ncasks of fine reserved wines for blending with youthful vintages,\r\nand bottles of _vin brut_, built up in solid stacks, that may be\r\nreckoned by their hundreds of thousands. At Messrs. Giesler's the\r\ndisgorging of the wine is accomplished in a small cellier partially\r\nunderground, and the temperature of which is very cool and equable. The\r\n_dégorgeurs_, isolated from the rest of the workpeople, are carrying\r\non their operations here by candlelight. So soon as the sediment is\r\nremoved, the bottles are raised in baskets to the cellier above, where\r\nthe liqueuring, recorking, stringing, and wiring are successively\r\naccomplished. By pursuing this plan the loss sustained by the\r\ndisgorgement is believed to be reduced to a minimum.\r\n\r\nExtensive as these premises are, they are still insufficient for the\r\nrequirements of the firm; and across the road is a spacious building\r\nwhere new bottles are stored, and the washing of the bottles in\r\npreparation for the tirage takes place. By the aid of the machinery\r\nprovided sixteen women, assisted by a couple of men, commonly wash some\r\nfifteen or sixteen thousand bottles in the course of a day. Here, too,\r\nstands one of the two large presses with which, at the epoch of the\r\nvintage, a hundred pièces of wine are pressed every four-and-twenty\r\nhours. The remaining press is installed in a cellier at the farther end\r\nof the garden on the other side of the road. Messrs. Giesler possess\r\nadditional presses at their vendangeoir at Bouzy, and during the\r\nvintage have the command of presses at Ay, Verzenay, Vertus, Le Mesnil,\r\n&c.; it being a rule of theirs always to press the grapes within a few\r\nhours after they are gathered, to obviate their becoming bruised by\r\ntheir own weight and imparting a dark colour to the wine, a contingency\r\ndifficult to guard against in seasons when the fruit is over-ripe. The\r\nfirm own vineyards at Avize, and have agreements with vine-proprietors\r\nat Ay, Bouzy, Verzenay, and elsewhere, to purchase their crops\r\nregularly every year. Messrs. Giesler's brand has secured its existing\r\nhigh repute solely through the fine quality of the wines shipped by the\r\nhouse--wines which are known and appreciated by all real connoisseurs\r\nof Champagne.\r\n\r\nFrom Messrs. Giesler's it is merely a short walk to the establishment\r\nof M. Charles de Cazanove, situated in the principal street of Avize.\r\nOn entering the court we encountered a tame young boar engaged in\r\nthe lively pursuit of chasing some terrified hens; while a trio\r\nof boar-hounds, basking on the sunny flagstones, contemplated his\r\nproceedings with lazy indifference. Boars abound in the woods\r\nhereabouts, and hunting them is a favourite pastime with the residents;\r\nand the young boar we had noticed proved to be one of the recent\r\ncaptures of the sons of M. de Cazanove, who are among the warmest\r\npartisans of the exciting sport.\r\n\r\nThe house of M. Charles de Cazanove was established in 1843, by its\r\npresent proprietor, on the foundation of a business which had been in\r\nexistence since 1811. Compared with the monumental grandeur of some\r\nof the great Reims and Epernay establishments, the premises present\r\na simple and modest aspect; nevertheless, they are capacious and\r\ncommodious, besides which, the growing business of the house has led\r\nto the acquisition of additional cellarage in other parts of Avize.\r\nMore important than all, however, is the quality of the wine with\r\nwhich these cellars are stocked; and, following the rule observed by\r\nChampagne firms of the highest repute, it has been a leading principle\r\nwith M. de Cazanove always to rely upon the choicer growths--those\r\nlight, delicate, and fragrant wines of the Marne which throw out\r\nthe true aroma of the flower of the vine. M. de Cazanove, who is\r\ndistinguished for his knowledge of viticulture, occupies an influential\r\nposition at Avize, being Vice-President of the Horticultural Society\r\nof the Marne, and a member of the committee charged with guarding the\r\nChampagne vineyards against the invasion of the phylloxera. His own\r\nvines include only those fine varieties to which the crus of the Marne\r\nowe their great renown. He possesses an excellent vineyard at Grauves,\r\nnear Avize; and his mother-in-law, Madame Poultier of Pierry, is one of\r\nthe principal vine-growers of the district.\r\n\r\nM. de Cazanove's wines are much appreciated in Paris, where his\r\nbusiness is very extensive. His shipments to England are also\r\nconsiderable; but from the circumstance of some of his principal\r\ncustomers importing the wine under special brands of their own, the\r\nbrand of the house is not so widely known as we should have anticipated.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINEYARDS OF AVIZE AND CRAMANT, FROM THE GARDEN OF M. C.\r\nDE CAZANOVE.]\r\n\r\nFrom M. de Cazanove's terraced garden in the rear of his establishment\r\na fine view is obtained of one of the most famous viticultural\r\ndistricts of the Champagne, yielding wines of remarkable delicacy and\r\nexquisite bouquet. On the left hand rises up the mountain of Avize,\r\nits summit fringed with dense woods, where in winter the wild-boar has\r\nhis lair. In front stretch the long vine-clad slopes of Cramant, with\r\norchards at their base, and the housetops of the village and the spire\r\nof the quaint old church just peeping over the brow of the hill. To the\r\nright towers the bold forest-crowned height of Saran, with M. Moët's\r\nchâteau perched half-way up its north-eastern slope; and fading away in\r\nthe hazy distance are the monotonous plains of the Champagne.\r\n\r\nWe have already explained that the wines of Avize and Cramant rank as\r\n_premiers crus_ of the white grape district, and that every Champagne\r\nmanufacturer of repute mingles one or the other in his cuvée. The white\r\ngrapes are usually gathered a fortnight or three weeks later than\r\nthe black varieties, but in other respects the vintaging of them is\r\nthe same. The grapes undergo the customary minute examination by the\r\n_éplucheuses_, and all unripe, damaged, and rotten berries being thrown\r\naside, the fruit is conveyed with due care to the press-houses in the\r\nlarge baskets known as _paniers mannequins_. The pressing takes place\r\nunder exactly the same conditions as the pressing of the black grapes;\r\nthe must, too, is drawn off into hogsheads to ferment, and by the end\r\nof the year, when the active fermentation has terminated, the wine is\r\nusually clear and limpid.\r\n\r\nAt Rilly-la-Montagne, on the line of railway between Reims and Epernay,\r\nRoper Frères & Cie., late of Epernay, have their establishment.\r\nStarting from the latter place, we pass Ay and Avenay, and then the\r\nlittle village of Germaine in the midst of the forest, and nigh the\r\nsummit of the mountain of Reims, with its 'Rendezvous des Chasseurs'\r\nin immediate proximity to the station. Finally we arrive at Rilly,\r\nwhich, spite of its isolated situation, has about it that aspect of\r\nprosperity common to the more favourable wine districts of France. This\r\nis scarcely surprising, when the quality of its wines is taken into\r\nconsideration. The still red wine of Rilly has long enjoyed a high\r\nlocal reputation, and to-day the Rilly growths are much sought after\r\nfor conversion into Champagne. White wine of 1874, from black grapes,\r\nfetched, we are informed, as much as 600 to 700 francs the pièce; while\r\nthe finer qualities from white grapes realised from 300 to 400 francs.\r\nMessrs. Roper Frères & Cie. are the owners of some productive vineyards\r\nsituated on the high-road to Chigny and Ludes.\r\n\r\nThe establishment of Roper Frères is adjacent to a handsome modern\r\nhouse standing back from the road in a large and pleasant garden,\r\nbounded by vineyards on two of its sides. In the celliers all the\r\nconveniences pertaining to a modern Champagne establishment are to be\r\nfound, while extending beneath the garden are the extensive cellars\r\nof the firm, comprising two stories of long and spacious galleries\r\nexcavated in the chalk, their walls and roofs being supported whenever\r\nnecessary by masonry. A curious feature about these cellars is that\r\nthe roots of the larger trees in the garden above have penetrated the\r\nroof of the upper story, and hang pendent overhead like innumerable\r\nstalactites. Here, after the comparatively new wine of 1874 had been\r\nshown to us--including samples of the vin brut or natural Champagne of\r\nwhich the firm make a specialty at a moderate price--some choice old\r\nChampagnes were brought forth, including the fine vintages of 1865,\r\n1857, and 1846. The latter wine had of course preserved very little of\r\nits effervescence, still its flavour was exceedingly fine, being soft\r\nand delicate to a degree. At the Vienna Exhibition of 1873, and the\r\nLondon Exhibition of 1874, the collection of Champagnes exhibited by\r\nRoper Frères met with favourable recognition from the international\r\njuries.\r\n\r\nOur tour through the Champagne vineyards and wine-cellars here comes\r\nto an end. It is true there are important establishments at Châlons,\r\nnotably those of the Perriers, Freminet et Fils, Dagonet et Fils,\r\nand Jacquard Frères. As, however, any description of these would be\r\nlittle else than a recapitulation of something we have already said, we\r\ncontent ourselves with merely notifying their existence, and close the\r\npresent chapter with a poem on Champagne, from the pen of M. Amaury de\r\nCazanove of Avize:\r\n\r\nODE AU CHAMPAGNE.\r\n\r\n    Pour ta beauté, pour ta gloire, ô Patrie,\r\n        Nous t'adorons ... surtout pour tes malheurs!\r\n    Oublions-les....

In parts it is covered by vast and luxuriant\r\nforests, where the pleasures of the chase are not lacking to the\r\nChampenois, who as a rule are eager in the pursuit of sport. In winter\r\nthese forests are the resort of wild-boar, who haunt by preference the\r\nwoods around Reims, journeying thither, it is said, by night from the\r\nfamous forest of the Ardennes--the scene of Rosalind's wanderings and\r\nTouchstone's eccentricities, as set forth in _As You Like It_; and\r\nwhose gloomy depths and tangled glens shelter not merely boars, but\r\nwolves as well.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn the villages of the Champagne on a cold winter's morning, with\r\nit snowing or blowing, you are frequently awake before daylight by\r\nthe noise of barking dogs, of horns sounding the departure, and of\r\nsome vehicle rolling heavily over the stones. A party of sportsmen\r\nis proceeding to the meet. Jokes and laughter enliven the journey,\r\nbut every one becomes silent and serious upon reaching the place of\r\nrendezvous, for the object of the gathering is the excitable and\r\nperilous boar-hunt.\r\n\r\nIn the Champagne it is no longer the fashion, as in Burgundy,\r\n\r\n    'With javelin's point a churlish swine to gore.'\r\n\r\nThe more certain rifle is the weapon usually employed, and these arms\r\nare now examined and carefully loaded. Meanwhile the reports of the\r\nkeepers are attentively listened to. They have beaten the wood, each\r\non his own side, accompanied by a bloodhound, and they inform the\r\nhunters what they have seen or found. Great experience is necessary to\r\naccomplish the _rembuchement_, as this tour of inspection is termed,\r\nin a satisfactory manner; and with some it is a veritable science.\r\nEventually, after a discussion among the more experienced ones, it is\r\ndecided to follow the scent which appears to be freshest; whereupon\r\nthe dogs are brought up coupled, and let loose upon the trail. The\r\nattack now begins. There are always two or three _piqueurs_ who follow\r\nthe dogs, exciting them with their voices, and making all the noise\r\npossible, as long as the game has not been roused from its lair.\r\nMeanwhile the marksmen place themselves at the posts indicated by the\r\npresident of the hunt, the most experienced being assigned the best\r\nspots, whilst those whose habit it is never to harm the boar go of\r\ntheir own accord 'up wind'--that is, to bad places--thus causing the\r\nanimal to 'refuse,' and to pass within range of guns that rarely let\r\nhim escape unhurt.\r\n\r\nAt first the dogs raise a somewhat distant cry--perhaps one has\r\nfollowed a wrong scent--and some of the huntsmen remark in a low tone\r\nto themselves that after all they would have done better to have\r\nstopped at home, and turned out of their beds at a less unseasonable\r\nhour; then, at least, they would not be standing with frozen feet in\r\nthe snow, and with colds in the head in perspective. But suddenly there\r\ncomes a cry of 'Vlô!'--the Champenois expression for designating the\r\nboar--'Attention!' 'Look out!' Then the report of a couple of shots,\r\nand finally the howling of the pack of dogs. Snow and cold are at once\r\nforgotten. Each man grasps his rifle and waits for the boar to pass by.\r\nThe branches of the underwood creak and break; there is a noise as of a\r\nsquadron of cavalry dashing into a wood; then, all of a sudden, a black\r\nmass is caught sight of approaching. But the boar is a cunning fellow;\r\nhe has seen the sportsman who is in wait for him, or has scented his\r\npresence, and will pass out of range. Now that luck has betrayed the\r\nlatter, he has to content himself with the _rôle_ of a spectator.\r\n\r\nSo far as one can judge by the barking of the dogs, the boar is\r\ndirecting his course to where an experienced marksman is posted--one\r\nwho is not about to fire his first difficult shot. Observe him: he\r\nis perfectly motionless, for the least movement might betray his\r\npresence; his eyes alone dart right and left in quest of the foe. Here\r\ncomes the boar, passing like a cannon-ball along the line, and there\r\nis scarcely time to catch a glimpse of him between the reports of two\r\nshots, which succeed each other with the rapidity of lightning. The\r\nboar is by no means an animal easy to knock over. The forest roads are\r\nnever more than ten to fifteen paces broad; and as there are marksmen\r\nboth on the right and left, it is necessary to reserve your fire until\r\nthe animal has crossed the road and is plunging again into cover. In\r\naddition to this, there are only two spots where a mortal wound can be\r\ninflicted upon the boar--either behind the shoulder or in the neck.\r\nHit elsewhere, he will lose but little blood, and the only effect of\r\nthe wound will be to render him more savage. He will rip up a dog or\r\ntwo, perhaps, and then rush off far away, without showing any further\r\nsign of injury. Boars carrying several bullets in their bodies, but\r\nrejoicing in capital health, as well as others covered with cicatrices,\r\nare frequently killed. Firing too high is a common fault with many\r\nmarksmen, arising from the fact that in winter the boar's bristles are\r\nvery long and thick, and that each one stands on end at the sight of\r\nan enemy, thus making the animal look much higher on his legs than he\r\nreally is.\r\n\r\nBut to return to our description of the hunt. The boar has just been\r\nhit by one of those rare marksmen, every bullet of whose rifle goes\r\nstraight to its intended billet. Although struck, the animal continues\r\nhis onward course, a couple of drops of blood which have tinged the\r\nsnow with red showing unmistakably that he has not been missed. The\r\ndogs who follow him closely hesitate for a minute as they reach the\r\nroadway, but the leader has espied the spot where the boar was wounded;\r\nhe sniffs the blood, and darts off again, followed by the pack, who\r\nhave full confidence in his discernment. The dogs are torn and wounded\r\nby the thorns and briers which continually obstruct their path, for\r\nthe boar rushes through the thickest and most inaccessible cover, in\r\nhopes of retarding the progress of his pursuers; but the hounds divine\r\nthat their prey is near, and the most tired among them recover all\r\ntheir energy. Suddenly a great silence succeeds the furious yelping\r\nand baying of a short time ago. The boar is about to turn at bay. His\r\nstrength is becoming exhausted, and feeling that he is doomed to die,\r\nhe has faced round, with his back towards some inaccessible thicket, so\r\nas not to be taken in the rear, and confronts his pursuers, determined\r\nto die bravely and to sell his life dearly. It is no longer the baying\r\nof a pack in full cry that now rends the air, but isolated yelpings and\r\nplaintive howlings, such as watch-dogs give vent to when strangers are\r\nwandering round the house they protect.\r\n\r\nThen comes the crowning feat of the hunt, and the most difficult to\r\naccomplish. The most intrepid marksman advances towards the dogs,\r\nhis hunting-knife and rifle alike ready, the former to be made use\r\nof should the latter not suffice. He has need of great prudence and\r\ngreat coolness to accomplish his task, for directly the boar hears\r\nhis approach he will unhesitatingly dash upon him. He must await the\r\nanimal's onslaught with a firm heart and steady hand, and only fire\r\nwhen sure of his aim. Often, however, the hunter is bothered by the\r\ndogs, which surround the boar on all sides, hang on to him from behind,\r\nand excite his fury. The position may become critical, and many a\r\nsportsman who has counted too much upon his nerve has found himself\r\ncompelled to climb a tree, whence he has been able to 'bowl over' the\r\nenemy, without incurring any danger. It is needless to add that when\r\ndiscovered in this position he has felt very much ashamed at having\r\nresorted to such an expedient.\r\n\r\nIn the Champagne the wild boar is almost invariably pursued on foot,\r\nthe minute subdivision of the land into different holdings and\r\nconsequent limitation of the right of sport rendering it very difficult\r\nto follow the animal on horseback. M. Roederer, it is true, started\r\na pack of hounds in the Forest of Reims; but at his death there were\r\nnot sufficient lovers of the chase to keep up this style of sport, and\r\nevery one fell into the habit of knocking over a wild-boar in the same\r\nprosaic fashion as a simple rabbit. However, some few years back, a\r\nrich landowner from Brittany, the Vicomte d'Honnincton, having had an\r\nopportunity of sport in the Champagne, and having seen that large game\r\nabounded, installed himself near the fine Forêt de la Traconne, in the\r\nneighbourhood of Sézanne, and resumed the chase of the wild-boar on\r\nhorseback. The great success he met with induced him to take up his\r\nquarters in this district, and his pack, composed of a cross between\r\nthe English staghound and the Artois hound, has become justly famous.\r\n\r\nIn the month of December 1878, an exciting day's sport was had with M.\r\nd'Honnincton's boar-hounds. The presence of herds of wild-boar having\r\nbeen noted in the neighbouring woods between Epernay and Montmort, M.\r\nd'Honnincton was soon to the fore with his pack, and all the sportsmen\r\nfor miles around were summoned. The meet was at the Château de la\r\nCharmoye, a regular hunters' rendezvous, belonging to the Vicomte\r\nde Bouthylliers, and situate in the heart of the woodland. During\r\nbreakfast one of the huntsmen came to announce that a huge _solitaire_\r\nhad passed the night at a short distance from the château. Everything,\r\ntherefore, promised well for sport. The guests mounted in haste, each\r\none equipped in true French style, with an immense hunting-horn round\r\nhis body and a light gun or a pistol attached to the saddle. The lively\r\nstrains of the horn had begun to sound on every side, and the hounds\r\nwere being uncoupled, when the boar, disturbed by all this noise,\r\nmajestically traversed the main avenue of the château, and pushed on\r\ntowards a group of ladies assembled to witness the departure of the\r\nsportsmen. A finer start would have been impossible. The hounds dashed\r\ntowards their prey as soon as they caught sight of him at full cry,\r\nand the _sonnerie du sanglier_ and the _vue_ were blazed forth by\r\nthe horns on every side. The hunt commenced. The greatest difficulty\r\nand the object of all was to hinder the boar from plunging into the\r\nthick of the forest, where, in the dense cover, he would have gained\r\na considerable advance upon the dogs. Thanks to the activity of the\r\nhuntsmen, who cut off his retreat on this side, it was possible to\r\ndrive him towards the plain of Montmort; and from this moment the sport\r\nwas as fine as can be imagined, it being easy to note the minor details\r\nof the hunt even from a distance. The boar made his way with difficulty\r\nover the ground saturated by rain, and the eagerness of the hounds\r\nincreased in proportion as they gained upon him.\r\n\r\nA broadish rivulet with very steep banks was reached. The boar tried to\r\nclear it at a bound, but fell into mid-stream. The sportsmen all came\r\nup at this moment, and with their horns began to sound in chorus 'The\r\nboar has taken soil;' the hounds plunged in and began to swim after\r\nthe boar, and the scene became a truly exciting one. At length the\r\nboar succeeded in quitting the stream; but frightened by the horsemen\r\nwhom he saw on the opposite shore, he recrossed it a second and then a\r\nthird time, amidst the hounds, who were assailing him on every side,\r\nand each time met with the same difficulty in ascending the bank. It\r\nmay be readily understood that he was getting exhausted by his efforts,\r\nand began to appear done up. He recovered his vigour, however, and\r\nsoon gained ground on the hounds. He had still two or three miles\r\nto cover in order to regain the forest, and it was necessary at all\r\ncosts to prevent him from accomplishing this. Then ensued a wild hunt,\r\na mad steeplechase over fields, hedges, brooks, ditches; the horses\r\nin several places sank over their hocks, and were covered with foam,\r\nbut whip and spur restored energy to the least ardent. The boar was\r\ngasping, but still kept on, and the steam from his body, which quite\r\nsurrounded him and caused him to resemble a four-legged demon, could be\r\nplainly perceived from a distance. In this style the hunt swept through\r\nthe little village of Lucy, with all the dogs of the place howling,\r\nthe women and children shrieking, and the men arming themselves with\r\nspades and pitchforks. But the boar not losing courage on this account,\r\nand despising these primitive weapons, did not stop, and drew nearer\r\nand nearer to the wood. The hounds were getting tired, and the most\r\nexperienced sportsmen began to despair somewhat of a successful day,\r\nwhen suddenly the beast plunged into a pond situate close to the\r\nforest, halted, rolled several times in the mud, and rose completely\r\ncovered in steam and mire. It is all over: the animal is at bay, and\r\ncannot go any further.\r\n\r\nThis is the interesting moment. The boar pulls himself together,\r\nfeeling that he is to die, and, up to his belly in water, he bravely\r\nawaits the pack. With his eye glowing with rage, his bristles erect,\r\nhe utters grunts of defiance. The fifty dogs throw themselves on to\r\nhim without a moment's hesitation; but four or five are sent rolling\r\ninto the middle of the water, never more to rise. The struggle which\r\nfollows is terrible; the boar's tusks tell at every blow, and the water\r\nbecomes literally red with blood. At length the foremost sportsmen\r\ncome up, and it is high time they do. Seven dogs are already lying on\r\ntheir backs, with their legs in the air, and almost all bear marks of\r\nthe boar's terrible tusks. The first who is ready alights from his\r\nsteed, and boldly advances into the water; for it would be imprudent\r\nto fire at the boar from the edge of the pond, and thereby run the\r\nrisk of wounding him, and rendering him still more furious, or even\r\nof killing one of the dogs, by whom he is surrounded. An interval of\r\nsolemn silence ensues; the horns only wait for the shot to be fired to\r\nsound the _hallali_. The dogs make way in order to let the sportsman\r\nadvance; the boar draws back a little, and then making a bound recovers\r\nall his strength for a rush upon his enemy. Woe to the man who misses\r\nhim! the boar will give him no quarter. But the sportsman waits for him\r\nvery quietly, and when he is only two paces from him plants a bullet\r\nbetween his eyes, which lays him dead. The notes of the _hallali_ awake\r\nthe echoes: never had a hunt been crowned by finer results. The setting\r\nsun lighted up the scene, which transpired just below the Château\r\nde Montmort, scarcely half a mile off, and the ladies assembled on\r\nthe terrace of the old château of Sully waved their handkerchiefs in\r\ncongratulation to the fortunate sportsmen.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing narrative furnishes a good idea of the ordinary method of\r\nhunting the wild-boar on horseback in the Champagne, a method which,\r\nthough offering at times varying details, arising from the size of the\r\nanimal pursued and the number and strength of the hounds engaged in the\r\nchase, presents, on the whole, a general resemblance to the description\r\njust given.\r\n\r\nSome years back boars were far from numerous in the Champagne, hiding\r\nthemselves, moreover, in inaccessible positions far away in the woods,\r\nso that it was necessary to cover a larger extent of ground in order to\r\nsight a recent trail. Latterly, however, these animals have multiplied\r\nconsiderably, each sow having seven or eight young ones at a litter,\r\nand littering three times a year. In the forests around Reims and\r\nEpernay twelve, and even fifteen, boars have been killed during a\r\nsingle hunt. It not unfrequently happens that a herd of fifty, and even\r\na hundred, boars are encountered together, when a veritable massacre\r\noften ensues, if the hunting-party only comprises a sufficient number\r\nof guns.\r\n\r\nThe victims include at times some sows with young grice, which the\r\nhunters frequently try to bring up. One of these little animals, who\r\nhad been named 'Snow' from having been captured one day when the snow\r\nwas on the ground, followed his owner about everywhere like the most\r\nfaithful poodle. His master would often take him into the wood and\r\nsimulate a hunt with his dogs. Snow, however, possessed vices as well\r\nas virtues, and one of his habits was an extremely disagreeable one.\r\nLike the rest of his species, he was very fond of rolling himself\r\nin the mire, and, on returning home, would proceed to clean himself\r\nby rubbing unconcernedly against the dresses of the ladies of the\r\nhouse. One Sunday his master had taken him out for a walk, and as\r\nthey returned home they passed the church, which the ladies of the\r\nlocality, arrayed in their richest attire, were just leaving. During\r\nhis walk Snow had taken two or three mud-baths, and, on meeting the\r\nfair devotees of Avize, he thought the occasion a propitious one for\r\ncleansing himself. He at once put the idea into practice, employing\r\nthe silk dresses of the ladies for the purpose. The children who\r\naccompanied them were greatly terrified, and rushed shrieking into the\r\nadjoining houses, pursued by the gambolling boar, who seemed to greatly\r\nenjoy the panic he had caused. As La Fontaine has remarked,\r\n\r\n    'Rien que la mort n'était capable\r\n    D'expier son forfait.'\r\n\r\nSo, after such an offence, poor Snow was sentenced to undergo capital\r\npunishment, and expiated by death his want of regard for the silk\r\nattire of the fair sex.\r\n\r\nAnother boar named 'Scotsman,' and belonging to the same sportsman, was\r\nalso an amusing fellow. He would stretch himself out in the sun of an\r\nafternoon as majestically as the Sultan on his divan, whilst a hen with\r\nwhom he had contracted a tender friendship kindly relieved him of his\r\nparasites.\r\n\r\nA gentleman of the same district owns two enormous sows, which follow\r\nhim like greyhounds whenever he rides out. When a friend asks him to\r\nstep indoors and to refresh or rest himself, he replies: 'I must beg\r\nyou to excuse me; I have with me _Catherine_ and _Rigolette_, who might\r\ninconvenience you.' The friend looks round to see who these interesting\r\nyoung people may be, and his surprise may be imagined when two big\r\nswine familiarly place their forepaws upon his shoulders.\r\n\r\nSeveral sportsmen of the Champagne possess packs of hounds, and the\r\ntrue boar-hound, the 'dog of black St. Hubert breed,' is really a\r\nmagnificent animal, with his long pendant ears, his open chest, and\r\nbroad-backed body. Hounds of the La Vendée and Poitou breeds are\r\nalso used at boar-hunts. Dogs, though they may be of excellent race,\r\nrequire, however, skilful training before they will hunt the boar. It\r\nis necessary they should see several boars killed ere they will venture\r\nto tackle this formidable enemy, of which the dog is instinctively\r\nafraid. House-dogs, curs, and terriers will at times pursue the boar\r\nadmirably, and prolong his standing for hours without approaching\r\nwithin range of the beast's tusks, whilst animals of a higher spirit\r\nwill allow themselves to be ripped up alive, or, if they escape, will\r\nnot dare to again approach their foe after a first repulse.\r\n\r\nSince boars became so numerous in the Champagne they have done\r\nconsiderable damage to the crops, a corn or potato field being soon\r\ndevastated by them. At harvest-time a watch has often to be set for\r\nthem by night. A few years ago, at the moment of the vintage, people\r\nwere even compelled to light large fires near the vineyards to scare\r\naway these dangerous neighbours.\r\n\r\nThe shooting season in the Champagne extends from the commencement of\r\nSeptember till the end of February; but boar-hunting is often prolonged\r\nuntil the first of May, and occasionally _battues_ are organised during\r\nthe summer.\r\n\r\nOther four-footed game tenanting the forests of the Champagne are\r\nthe roe-deer, in tolerable quantity; a few fallow-deer and stags and\r\nwolves, which latter are still numerous, spite of the warfare carried\r\non against them. The roe-deer is hunted, like the boar, with hounds;\r\nbut this easy sport, which does not possess the attraction of danger,\r\nis quite neglected when boars are numerous. The forests also give\r\nshelter to hares in abundance, martins, wild-cats, and foxes, the\r\nlatter being rigorously destroyed on account of their depredations.\r\nThey are stifled by smoke in their holes, or else poisoned or taken in\r\ntraps.\r\n\r\nSportsmen are so numerous in every little village of the Marne, the\r\nshooting license only costing five-and-twenty francs, that feathered\r\ngame has become very rare. The most remarkable specimen is the\r\ncaimpetière, or small bustard, which exists only in the Champagne and\r\nAlgeria, and the flesh of which is highly esteemed.\r\n\r\nPartridges and hares would have entirely disappeared from the plains\r\nwere it not for the shelter which the vineyards afford them, for woe\r\nto him who ventures to shoot among the vines! The vine is as sacred to\r\nthe Champenois as the mistletoe was to their Gallic forefathers. Great\r\nseverity is shown in respect to trespassers at the epoch when the vines\r\nare sprouting, for each broken bud represents a bunch of grapes, which\r\nits owner hoped might realise its weight in gold.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE VINEYARDS OF THE COTEAU DE SAUMUR.]\r\n\r\n                               PART III.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                                  I.\r\n\r\n              /Sparkling Saumur and Sparkling Sauternes./\r\n\r\n    The sparkling wines of the Loire often palmed off as\r\n    Champagne--The finer qualities improve with age--Anjou the\r\n    cradle of the Plantagenet kings--Saumur and its dominating\r\n    feudal Château and antique Hôtel de Ville--Its sinister Rue\r\n    des Payens and steep tortuous Grande Rue--The vineyards of\r\n    the Coteau of Saumur--Abandoned stone-quarries converted into\r\n    dwellings--The vintage in progress--Old-fashioned pressoirs--The\r\n    making of the wine--Touraine the favourite residence of the\r\n    earlier French monarchs--After a night's carouse at the epoch\r\n    of the Renaissance--The Vouvray vineyards--Balzac's picture\r\n    of La Vallée Coquette--The village of Vouvray and the Château\r\n    of Moncontour--Vernou, with its reminiscences of Sully and\r\n    Pépin-le-Bref--The vineyards around Saumur--Remarkable ancient\r\n    Dolmens--Ackerman-Laurance's establishment at Saint-Florent--Their\r\n    extensive cellars, ancient and modern--Treatment of the\r\n    newly-vintaged wine--The cuvée--Proportions of wine from black\r\n    and white grapes--The bottling and disgorging of the wine\r\n    and finishing operations--The Château of Varrains and the\r\n    establishment of M.

Vintaged on the\r\nbanks of the Loire, these are largely consigned to the English and\r\nother markets, labelled Crême de Bouzy, Sillery and Ay Mousseux, Cartes\r\nNoires and Blanches, and the like; while their corks are branded\r\nwith the names of phantom firms, supposed to be located at Reims and\r\nEpernay. As a rule, these wines come from around Saumur; but they are\r\nnot necessarily the worse on that account, for the district produces\r\ncapital sparkling wines, the finer qualities of which improve greatly\r\nby being kept for a few years. One curious thing shown to us at Saumur\r\nwas the album of a manufacturer of sparkling wines containing examples\r\nof the many hundred labels ticketed with which his produce had for\r\nyears past been sold. Not one of these labels assigned to the wines the\r\nname of their real maker or their true birthplace, but introduced them\r\nunder the auspices of mythical dukes and counts, as being manufactured\r\nat châteaux which are so many 'castles in Spain,' and as coming from\r\nAy, Bouzy, Châlons, Epernay, Reims, and Verzenay, but never by any\r\nchance from Saumur.\r\n\r\nBeing produced from robuster growths than the sparkling wines of\r\nthe Department of the Marne, sparkling Saumur will always lack that\r\nexcessive lightness which is the crowning grace of fine Champagne;\r\nstill, it has only to be kept for a few years, instead of being drunk\r\nshortly after its arrival from the wine-merchant, for its quality to\r\nbecome greatly improved and its intrinsic value to be considerably\r\nenhanced. We have drunk sparkling Saumur that had been in bottle for\r\nnearly twenty years, and found the wine not only remarkably delicate,\r\nbut, singular to say, with plenty of effervescence.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: STATUE OF RICHARD C[OE]UR DE LION AT FONTEVRAULT.]\r\n\r\nTo an Englishman Anjou is one of the most interesting of the ancient\r\nprovinces of France. It was the cradle of the Plantagenet kings, and\r\nonly ten miles from Saumur still repose the bones of Henry, the first\r\nPlantagenet, and Richard of the Lion Heart, beneath their elaborate\r\ncoloured and gilt effigies, in the so-called Cimetière des Rois of the\r\nhistoric Abbey of Fontevrault. The famous vineyards of the Coteau de\r\nSaumur, eastward of the town and bordering the Loire, extend as far as\r\nhere, and include the communes of Dampierre, Souzay, Varrains, Chacé,\r\nParnay, Turquant, and Montsoreau, the last-named within three miles of\r\nFontevrault, and chiefly remarkable through its seigneur of ill-fame,\r\nJean de Chambes, who instigated his wife to lure Bussy d'Amboise to an\r\nassignation in order that he might the more surely poignard him. Saumur\r\nis picturesquely placed at the foot of this bold range of heights, near\r\nwhere the little river Thouet runs into the broad and rapid Loire.\r\nA massive-looking old château, perched on the summit of an isolated\r\ncrag, stands out grandly against the clear sky and dominates the town,\r\nthe older houses of which crouch at the foot of the lofty hill and\r\nclimb its steepest sides. The restored antique Hôtel de Ville, in the\r\nPointed style, with its elegant windows, graceful belfry, and florid\r\nwrought-iron balconies, stands back from the quay bordering the Loire.\r\nIn the rear is the Rue des Payens, whither the last of the Huguenots of\r\nthis 'metropolis of Protestantism,' as it was formerly styled, retired,\r\nconverting their houses into so many fortresses to guard against being\r\nsurprised by their Catholic adversaries. Adjacent is the steep tortuous\r\nGrande Rue, of which Balzac--himself a Tourangeau--has given such a\r\ngraphic picture in his _Eugénie Grandet_, the scene of which is laid\r\nat Saumur. To-day, however, only a few of its ancient carved-timber\r\nhouses, quaint overhanging corner turrets, and fantastically studded\r\nmassive oak doors, have escaped demolition.\r\n\r\nThe vineyards of the Coteau de Saumur, yielding the finest wines, are\r\nreached by the road skirting the river, the opposite low banks of which\r\nare fringed with willows and endless rows of poplars, which at the\r\ntime of our visit were already golden with the fading tints of autumn.\r\nNumerous fantastic windmills crown the heights, the summit of which\r\nis covered with vines, varied by dense patches of woodland. Here, as\r\nelsewhere along the banks of the Loire, the many abandoned quarries\r\nalong the face of the hill have been turned by the peasants into cosy\r\ndwellings by simply walling-up the entrances, while leaving, of course,\r\nthe necessary apertures for doors and windows. Dampierre, the first\r\nvillage reached, has many of these cave-dwellings, and numbers of its\r\nhouses are picturesquely perched up the sides of the slope. The holiday\r\ncostumes of the peasant women encountered in the neighbourhood of\r\nSaumur are exceedingly quaint, their elaborate and varied headdresses\r\nbeing counterparts of _coiffures_ in vogue so far back as three and\r\nfour centuries ago.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PEASANT WOMEN OF THE ENVIRONS OF SAUMUR.]\r\n\r\nQuitting the banks of the river, we ascend a steep tortuous road, shut\r\nin on either side by high stone walls--for hereabouts all the best\r\nvineyards are scrupulously enclosed--and finally reach the summit of\r\nthe heights, whence a view is gained over what the Saumurois proudly\r\nstyle the grand valley of the Loire. Everywhere around the vintage is\r\ngoing on. The vines are planted rather more than a yard apart, and\r\nthose yielding black grapes are trained, as a rule, up tall stakes,\r\nalthough some few are trained espalier fashion. Women dexterously\r\ndetach the bunches with pruning-knives and throw them into the\r\n_seilles_--small squat buckets with wooden handles--the contents of\r\nwhich are emptied from time to time into baskets--the counterpart of\r\nthe chiffonnier's _hotte_, and coated with pitch inside so as to close\r\nall the crevices of the wickerwork--which the _portes-bastes_ carry\r\nslung to their backs. When white wine is being made from black grapes\r\nfor sparkling Saumur, the grapes are conveyed in these baskets to the\r\nunderground pressoirs in the neighbouring villages before their skins\r\nget at all broken, in order that the wine may be as pale as possible in\r\ncolour.\r\n\r\nThe black grape yielding the best wine in the Saumur district is the\r\nbreton, said to be the same as the carbinet-sauvignon, the leading\r\nvariety in the grand vineyards of the Médoc. Other species of black\r\ngrapes cultivated around Saumur are the varennes, yielding a soft and\r\ninsipid wine of no kind of value, and the liverdun, or large gamay,\r\nthe prevalent grape in the Mâconnais, and the same which in the days\r\nof Philippe-le-Hardi the _parlements_ of Metz and Dijon interdicted\r\nthe planting and cultivation of. The prevalent white grapes are the\r\nlarge and small pineau blanc, the bunches of the former being of an\r\nintermediate size, broad and pyramidal in shape, and with the berries\r\nclose together. These have fine skins, are oblong in shape, and of a\r\ntransparent yellowish-green hue tinged with red, are very sweet and\r\njuicy, and as a rule ripen late. As for the small pineau, the bunches\r\nare less compact, the berries are round and of a golden tint, are finer\r\nas well as sweeter in flavour, and ripen somewhat earlier than the\r\nfruit of the larger variety.\r\n\r\nWe noticed as we drove through the villages of Champigny and\r\nVarrains--the former celebrated for its fine red wines, and more\r\nespecially its cru of the Clos des Cordeliers--that hardly any of the\r\nhouses had windows looking on to the narrow street, but that all were\r\nprovided with low openings for shooting the grapes into the cellar,\r\nwhere, when making red wine, they are trodden, but when making white\r\nwine, whether from black or white grapes, they are invariably pressed.\r\nEach of the houses had its ponderous porte-cochère and low narrow\r\nportal leading into the large enclosed yard at its side, and over the\r\nhigh blank walls vines were frequently trained, pleasantly varying\r\ntheir dull gray monotony.\r\n\r\nThe grapes on being shot into the openings just mentioned fall through\r\na kind of tunnel into a reservoir adjacent to the heavy press, which\r\nis invariably of wood and of the old-fashioned cumbersome type. They\r\nare forthwith placed beneath the press and usually subjected to five\r\nseparate squeezes, the must from the first three being reserved for\r\nsparkling wine, while that from the two latter, owing to its being more\r\nor less deeply tinted, only serves for table-wine. The must is at once\r\nrun off into casks, in order that it may not ferment on the grape-skins\r\nand imbibe any portion of their colouring matter. Active fermentation\r\nspeedily sets in, and lasts for a fortnight or three weeks, according\r\nto whether the temperature chances to be high or low.\r\n\r\nThe vintaging of the white grapes takes place about a fortnight\r\nlater than the black grapes, and is commonly a compound operation,\r\nthe best and ripest bunches being first of all gathered just as the\r\nberries begin to get shrivelled and show symptoms of approaching\r\nrottenness. It is these selected grapes that yield the best wine. The\r\nsecond gathering, which follows shortly after the first, includes\r\nall the grapes remaining on the vines, and yields a wine perceptibly\r\ninferior in quality. The grapes on their arrival at the press-house\r\nare generally pressed immediately, and the must is run off into tuns\r\nto ferment. At the commencement these tuns are filled up every three\r\nor four days to replace the fermenting must which has flowed over;\r\nafterwards any waste is made good at the interval of a week, and then\r\nonce a fortnight, the bungholes of the casks being securely closed\r\ntowards the end of the year, by which time the first fermentation is\r\nover.\r\n\r\nIt should be noted that the Saumur sparkling wine manufacturers draw\r\nconsiderable supplies of the white wine, required to impart lightness\r\nand effervescence to their _vin préparé_, from the Vouvray vineyards.\r\nVouvray borders the Loire a few miles from the pleasant city of Tours,\r\nwhich awakens sinister recollections of truculent Louis XI., shut\r\nup in his fortified castle of Plessis-lez-Tours, around which Scott\r\nhas thrown the halo of his genius in his novel of _Quentin Durward_.\r\nA succession of vineyard slopes stretch from one to another of the\r\nmany historic châteaux along this portion of the Loire, the romantic\r\nassociations of which render the Touraine one of the most interesting\r\nprovinces of France. Near Tours, besides the vineyards of Saint-Cyr\r\nare those of Joué and Saint-Avertin; the two last situate on the\r\nopposite bank of the Cher, where the little town of Joué, perched on\r\nthe summit of a hill in the midst of vineyards, looks over a vast\r\nplain known by the country-people as the Landes de Charlemagne, the\r\nscene, according to local tradition, of Charles Martel's great victory\r\nover the Saracens. The Saint-Avertin vineyards extend towards the\r\neast, stretching almost to the forest of Larçay, on the borders of the\r\nCher, where Paul Louis Courier, the famous vigneron pamphleteer of\r\nthe Restoration, noted alike for his raillery, wit, and satire, fell\r\nbeneath the balls of an assassin. A noticeable cru in the neighbourhood\r\nof Tours is that of Cinq Mars, the ruined château of which survives as\r\na memorial of the vengeance of Cardinal Richelieu, who, after having\r\nsent its owner to the scaffold, commanded its massive walls and towers\r\nto be razed '_à hauteur d'infamie_,' as we see them now.\r\n\r\nTouraine, from its central position, its pleasant air, and its fertile\r\nsoil, was ever a favourite residence of the earlier French monarchs,\r\nand down to the days of the Bourbons the seat of government continually\r\nvacillated between the banks of the Seine and those of the Loire. The\r\nvintages that ripen along the river have had their day of court favour\r\ntoo; for if Henri of Andelys sneeringly describes the wine of Tours\r\nas turning sour, in his famous poem of the _Bataille des Vins_, the\r\nsweet white wines of Anjou were greatly esteemed throughout the Middle\r\nAges, and, with those of Orleans, were highly appreciated in Paris down\r\nto the seventeenth century. The cult of the 'dive Bouteille' and the\r\nfashion of Pantagruelic repasts have always found favour in the fat and\r\nfertile 'garden of France;' and the spectacle of citizens, courtiers,\r\nand monks staggering fraternally along, 'waggling their heads,' as\r\nRabelais describes them, after a night of it at the tavern, was no\r\nuncommon one in the streets of its old historic towns during the period\r\nof the Renaissance.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: TAVERN ROYSTERERS AT EARLY MORNING IN THE TOURAINE.]\r\n\r\nOn proceeding to Vouvray from Tours, we skirt a succession of\r\npoplar-fringed meadows, stretching eastward in the direction of\r\nAmboise along the right bank of the Loire; and after a time a curve in\r\nthe river discloses to view a range of vine-clad heights, extending\r\nsome distance beyond the village of Vouvray. Our route lies past\r\nthe picturesque ruins of the abbey of Marmoûtier, immortalised in\r\nthe piquant pages of the _Contes Drôlatiques_, and the Château des\r\nRoches--one of the most celebrated castles of the Loire--the numerous\r\nexcavations in the soft limestone ridge on which they are perched being\r\nconverted as usual into houses, magazines, and wine-cellars. We proceed\r\nthrough the village of Rochecorbon, and along a road winding among the\r\nspurs of the Vouvray range, past hamlets, half of whose inhabitants\r\nlive in these primitive dwellings hollowed out of the cliff, and\r\nfinally enter the charming Vallé Coquette, hemmed in on all sides with\r\nvine-clad slopes. Here a picturesque old house, half château, half\r\nhomestead, was pointed out to us as a favourite place of sojourn of\r\nBalzac, who held the wine of Vouvray in high esteem, and who speaks\r\nof this rocky ridge as 'inhabited by a population of vine-dressers,\r\ntheir houses of several stories being hollowed out in the face of the\r\ncliff, and connected by dangerous staircases hewn in the soft stone.\r\nSmoke curls from most of the chimneys which peep above the green crest\r\nof vines, while the blows of the cooper's hammer resound in several of\r\nthe cellars. A young girl trips to her garden over the roofs of these\r\nprimitive dwellings, and an old woman, tranquilly seated on a ledge of\r\nprojecting rock, supported solely by straggling roots of ivy spreading\r\nitself over the disjointed stones, leisurely turns her spinning-wheel,\r\nregardless of her dangerous position.' The foregoing picture, sketched\r\nby the author of _La Comédie Humaine_ forty years ago, has scarcely\r\nchanged at the present day.\r\n\r\nAt the point where the village of Vouvray climbs half-way up the\r\nvine-crested ridge the rapid-winding Cise throws itself into the\r\nLoire, and on crossing the bridge that spans the tributary stream\r\nwe discern on the western horizon, far beyond the verdant islets\r\nstudding the swollen Loire, the tall campaniles of Tours Cathedral,\r\nwhich seem to rise out of the water like a couple of Venetian towers.\r\nVouvray is a trim little place, clustered round about with numerous\r\npleasant villas in the midst of charming gardens. The modern château\r\nof Moncontour here dominates the slope, and its terraced gardens, with\r\ntheir fantastically-clipped trees and geometric parterres, rise tier\r\nabove tier up the face of the picturesque height that overlooks the\r\nbroad fertile valley, with its gardens, cultivated fields, patches\r\nof woodland, and wide stretches of green pasture which, fringed with\r\nwillows and poplars, border the swollen waters of the Loire. Where\r\nthe river Brenne empties itself into the Cise the Coteau de Vouvray\r\nslopes off towards the north, and there rise up the vine-clad heights\r\nof Vernou, yielding a similar but inferior wine to that of Vouvray.\r\nThe village of Vernou is nestled under the hill, and near the porch of\r\nits quaint little church a venerable elm-tree is pointed out as having\r\nbeen planted by Sully, Henry IV.'s able Minister. Here, too, an ancient\r\nwall, pierced with curious arched windows, and forming part of a modern\r\nbuilding, is regarded by popular tradition as belonging to the palace\r\nin which Pépin-le-Bref, father of Charlemagne, lived at Vernou.\r\n\r\nThe communes of Dampierre, Souzay, and Parnay, in the neighbourhood\r\nof Saumur, produce still red wines rivalling those of Champigny,\r\nbesides which all the finest white wines are vintaged hereabouts--in\r\nthe Perrière, the Poilleux, and the Clos Morain vineyards, and in\r\nthe Rotissans vineyard at Turquant. Wines of very fair quality are\r\nalso grown on the more favourable slopes extending southwards along\r\nthe valley of the Thouet, and comprised in the communes of Varrains,\r\nChacé, St. Cyr-en-Bourg, and Brézé. The whole of this district,\r\nby the way, abounds with interesting archæological remains. While\r\nvisiting the vineyards of Varrains and Chacé we came upon a couple\r\nof dolmens--vestiges of the ancient Celtic population of the valley\r\nof the Loire singularly abundant hereabouts. Brézé, the marquisate\r\nof which formerly belonged to Louis XVI.'s famous grand master\r\nof the ceremonies--immortalised by the rebuff he received from\r\nMirabeau--boasts a noble château on the site of an ancient fortress,\r\nin connection with which there are contemporary excavations in the\r\nneighbouring limestone, designed for a garrison of 500 or 600 men.\r\nBeyond the vineyards of Saint-Florent, westward of Saumur and on the\r\nbanks of the Thouet, is an extensive plateau, partially overgrown with\r\nvines, where may be traced the remains of a Roman camp. Moreover, in\r\nthe southern environs of Saumur, in the midst of vineyards producing\r\nexclusively white wines, is one of the most remarkable dolmens known.\r\nThis imposing structure, perfect in all respects save that one of\r\nthe four enormous stones which roof it in has been split in two, and\r\nrequires to be supported, is no less than 65 feet in length, 23 feet in\r\nwidth, and 10 feet high.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: DOLMEN AT BAGNEUX, NEAR SAUMUR.]\r\n\r\nAt Saint-Florent, the pleasant little suburb of Saumur, skirting the\r\nriver Thouet, and sheltered by steep hills formed of soft limestone,\r\nwhich offers great facilities for the excavation of extensive\r\ncellars, the largest manufacturer of Saumur sparkling wines has his\r\nestablishment. Externally this offers but little to strike the eye. A\r\ncouple of pleasant country houses, half hidden by spreading foliage,\r\nstand at the two extremities of a spacious and well-kept garden, beyond\r\nwhich one catches a glimpse of some outbuildings sheltered by the\r\nvine-crowned cliff, in which a labyrinth of gloomy galleries has been\r\nhollowed out. Here M. Ackerman-Laurance, the extent of whose business\r\nranks him as second among the sparkling wine manufacturers of the\r\nworld, stores something like 10,000 casks and several million bottles\r\nof wine.\r\n\r\nAt the commencement of the present century, in the days when, as\r\nBalzac relates in his _Eugénie Grandet_, the Belgians bought up\r\nentire vintages of Saumur wine, then largely in demand with them for\r\nsacramental purposes, the founder of the Saint-Florent house commenced\r\nto deal in the ordinary still wines of the district. Nearly half a\r\ncentury ago he was led to attempt the manufacture of sparkling wines,\r\nbut his efforts to bring them into notice failed; and he was on the\r\npoint of abandoning his enterprise, when an order for one hundred\r\ncases revived his hopes, and led to the foundation of the present vast\r\nestablishment. As already mentioned, for many miles all the heights\r\nalong the Loire have been more or less excavated for stone for building\r\npurposes, so that every one hereabouts who grows wine or deals in\r\nit has any amount of cellar accommodation ready to hand. It was the\r\nvast extent of the galleries which M. Ackerman _père_ discovered\r\nalready excavated at Saint-Florent that induced him to settle there in\r\npreference to Saumur. Extensive, however, as the original vaults were,\r\nconsiderable additional excavations have from time to time been found\r\nnecessary; and to-day the firm is still further increasing the area of\r\nits cellars, which already comprise three principal avenues, each the\r\nthird of a mile long, and no fewer than sixty transverse galleries, the\r\ntotal length of which is several miles. One great advantage is that the\r\nwhole are on the ordinary level.\r\n\r\nRanged against the black uneven walls of the more tortuous ancient\r\nvaults which give access to these labyrinthine corridors are thousands\r\nof casks of wine--some in single rows, others in triple tiers--forming\r\nthe reserve stock of the establishment. As may be supposed, a powerful\r\nvinous odour permeates these vaults, in which the fumes of wine have\r\nbeen accumulating for the best part of a century. After passing\r\nbeneath a massive stone arch which separates the old cellars from\r\nthe new, a series of broad and regularly proportioned galleries are\r\nreached, having bottles stacked in their tens of thousands on either\r\nside. Overhead the roof is perforated at regular intervals with\r\ncircular shafts, affording both light and ventilation, and enabling\r\nthe temperature to be regulated to a nicety. In these lateral and\r\ntransverse galleries millions of bottles of wine in various stages of\r\npreparation are stacked.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CELLARS OF M. ACKERMAN-LAURANCE AT SAINT-FLORENT.\r\nLABELLING AND PACKING SPARKLING SAUMUR.]\r\n\r\nWe have explained that in the Champagne it is the custom for the\r\nmanufacturers of sparkling wine to purchase considerable quantities of\r\ngrapes from the surrounding growers, and to press these themselves,\r\nor have them pressed under their own superintendence. At Saumur only\r\nthose firms possessing vineyards make their own _vin brut_, the bulk\r\nof the wine used for conversion into sparkling wine being purchased\r\nfrom the neighbouring growers. On the newly-expressed must arriving\r\nat M. Ackerman-Laurance's cellars it is allowed to rest until the\r\ncommencement of the ensuing year, when half of it is mixed with wine\r\nin stock belonging to last year's vintage, and the remaining half\r\nis reserved for mingling with the must of the ensuing vintage. The\r\nblending is accomplished in a couple of colossal vats hewn out of the\r\nrock, and coated on the inside with cement. Each of these vats is\r\nprovided with 200 paddles for thoroughly mixing the wine, and with five\r\npipes for drawing it off when the amalgamation is complete. Usually\r\nthe cuvée will embrace 1600 hogsheads, or 80,000 gallons of wine,\r\nalmost sufficient for half a million bottles. A fourth of this quantity\r\ncan be mixed in each vat at a single operation, and this mixing is\r\nrepeated again and again until the last gallon run off is of precisely\r\nthe same type as the first. For the finer qualities of sparkling\r\nSaumur the proportion of wine from the black grapes to that from white\r\nis generally at the rate of three or four to one. For the inferior\r\nqualities more wine from white than from black grapes is invariably\r\nused. Only in the wine from white grapes is the effervescent principle\r\nretained to any particular extent; but, on the other hand, the wine\r\nfrom black grapes imparts both quality and vinous character to the\r\nblend.\r\n\r\nThe blending having been satisfactorily accomplished, the wine is\r\nstored in casks, never perfectly filled, yet with their bungholes\r\ntightly closed, and slowly continues its fermentation, eating up its\r\nsugar, purging itself, and letting fall its lees. Three months later it\r\nis fined. It is rarely kept in the wood for more than a year, though\r\nsometimes the superior qualities remain for a couple of years in cask.\r\nOccasionally it is even bottled in the spring following the vintage;\r\nstill, as a rule, the bottling of sparkling Saumur takes place during\r\nthe ensuing summer months, when the temperature is at the highest,\r\nas this insures to it a greater degree of effervescence. At the time\r\nof bottling its saccharine strength is raised to a given degree by\r\nthe addition of the finest sugar-candy, and henceforward the wine is\r\nsubjected to precisely the same treatment as is pursued with regard to\r\nChampagne.\r\n\r\nIt is in a broad but sombre gallery of the more ancient vaults--the\r\nroughly-hewn walls of which are black from the combined action of\r\nalcohol and carbonic acid gas--that the processes of disgorging the\r\nwine of its sediment, adding the syrup, filling up the bottles with\r\nwine to replace that which gushes out when the disgorging operation is\r\nperformed, together with the re-corking, stringing, and wiring of the\r\nbottles, are carried on. The one or two adjacent shafts impart very\r\nlittle light, but a couple of resplendent metal reflectors, which at\r\na distance one might fancy to be some dragon's flaming eyes, combined\r\nwith the lamps placed near the people at work, effectually illuminate\r\nthe spot.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: THE CELLARS OF M. LOUIS DUVAU AÎNÉ AT THE CHÂTEAU OF\r\nVARRAINS.]\r\n\r\nAnother considerable manufacturer of sparkling Saumur is M. Louis\r\nDuvau aîné, owner of the château of Varrains, in the village of the\r\nsame name, at no great distance from the Coteau de Saumur. His cellars\r\nadjoin the château, a picturesque but somewhat neglected structure\r\nof the last century, with sculptured medallions in high relief above\r\nthe lower windows, and florid vases surmounting the mansards in the\r\nroof. In front is a large rambling court shaded with acacia and lime\r\ntrees, and surrounded by outbuildings, prominent among which is a\r\npicturesque dovecot, massive at the base as a martello tower, and\r\nhaving an elegant open stone lantern springing from its bell-shaped\r\nroof. The cellars are entered down a steep incline under a low stone\r\narch, the masonry above which is overgrown with ivy in large clusters\r\nand straggling creeping plants. We soon come upon a deep recess to the\r\nright, wherein stands a unique cumbersome screw-press, needing ten or\r\na dozen men to work the unwieldy capstan which sets the juice flowing\r\nfrom the crushed grapes into the adjacent shallow trough. On our left\r\nhand are a couple of ancient reservoirs, formed out of huge blocks of\r\nstone, with the entrance to a long vaulted cellar filled with wine in\r\ncask. We advance slowly in the uncertain light along a succession of\r\ngloomy galleries, with moisture oozing from their blackened walls and\r\nroofs, picking our way between bottles of wine stacked in huge square\r\npiles and rows of casks raised in tiers. Suddenly a broad flood of\r\nlight shooting down a lofty shaft throws a Rembrandtish effect across\r\na spacious and most melodramatic-looking cave, roughly hewn out of the\r\nrock, and towards which seven dimly-lighted galleries converge. On all\r\nsides a scene of bustling animation presents itself. From one gallery\r\nmen keep arriving with baskets of wine ready for the disgorger; while\r\nalong another bottles of wine duly dosed with syrup are being borne off\r\nto be decorated with metal foil and their distinctive labels. Groups\r\nof workmen are busily engaged disgorging, dosing, and re-corking the\r\nnewly-arrived bottles of wine; corks fly out with a succession of loud\r\nreports, suggestive of the irregular fire of a party of skirmishers;\r\na fizzing, spurting, and spluttering of the wine next ensues, and is\r\nfollowed by the incessant clicking of the various apparatus employed in\r\nthe corking and wiring of the bottles.\r\n\r\nGradual inclines conduct to the two lower tiers of galleries, for the\r\ncellars of M. Duvau consist of as many as three stories. Down below\r\nthere is naturally less light, and the temperature, too, is sensibly\r\ncolder. Advantage is taken of this latter circumstance to remove\r\nthe newly-bottled wine to these lower vaults whenever an excessive\r\ndevelopment of carbonic acid threatens the bursting of an undue\r\nproportion of bottles, a casualty which among the Saumur sparkling\r\nwine manufacturers ranges far higher than with the manufacturers of\r\nChampagne. For the economy of time and labour, a lift, raised and\r\nlowered by means of a capstan worked by horses, is employed to transfer\r\nthe bottles of wine from one tier of cellars to another.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe demand for sparkling Saumur is evidently on the increase, for M.\r\nDuvau, at the time of our visit, was excavating extensive additional\r\ncellarage. The subsoil at Varrains being largely composed of marl,\r\nwhich is much softer than the tufa of the Saint-Florent coteau,\r\nnecessitated the roofs of the new galleries being worked in a\r\nparticular form in order to avoid having recourse to either brickwork\r\nor masonry. Tons of this excavated marl were being spread over the soil\r\nof M. Duvau's vineyard in the rear of the château, greatly, it was\r\nsaid, to the benefit of the vines, whose grapes were all of the black\r\nvariety; indeed, scarcely any wine is vintaged from white grapes in the\r\ncommune of Varrains.\r\n\r\nAt M. Duvau's we went through a complete scale of sparkling Saumurs,\r\ncommencing with the younger and less matured samples, and ascending\r\nstep by step to wines a dozen and more years old. Every year seemed to\r\nproduce an improvement in the wine, the older varieties gaining greatly\r\nin delicacy and softening very perceptibly in flavour.\r\n\r\nFinding that sparkling wines were being made in most of the\r\nwine-producing districts of France, where the growths were\r\nsufficiently light and of the requisite quality, Messrs. E. Normandin\r\n& Co. conceived the idea of laying the famous Bordeaux district\r\nunder contribution for a similar purpose, and, aided by a staff of\r\nexperienced workmen from Epernay, they have succeeded in producing\r\na sparkling Sauternes. Sauternes, as is well known, is one of the\r\nfinest of white wines, soft, delicate, and of beautiful flavour, and\r\nits transformation into a sparkling wine has been very successfully\r\naccomplished. Messrs. Normandin's head-quarters are in the thriving\r\nlittle town of Châteauneuf, in the pleasant valley of the Charente,\r\nand within fifteen miles of Angoulême, a famous old French town,\r\nencompassed by ancient ramparts and crumbling corner-towers; and which,\r\ndominated by the lofty belfry of its restored semi-Byzantine cathedral,\r\nrising in a series of open arcades, spreads itself picturesquely out\r\nalong a precipitous height, watered at its base by the rivers Anguienne\r\nand Charente. Between Angoulême and Châteauneuf vineyard plots dotted\r\nover with walnut-trees, or simple rows of vines divided by strips of\r\nripening maize, and broken up at intervals by bright green pastures,\r\nline both banks of the river Charente. The surrounding country is\r\nundulating and picturesque. Poplars and elms fringe the roadsides,\r\ndivide the larger fields and vineyards, and screen the cosy-looking\r\nred-roofed farmhouses, which present to the eyes of the passing tourist\r\na succession of pictures of quiet rural prosperity.\r\n\r\nChâteauneuf communicates with the Sauternes district by rail, so\r\nthat supplies of wine from there are readily obtainable. Vin de\r\nColombar--a famous white growth which English and Dutch cruisers used\r\nto ascend the Charente to obtain cargoes of when the Jerez wines were\r\nshut out from England by the Spanish War of Succession--vintaged\r\nprincipally at Montignac-le-Coq, also enters largely into Messrs.\r\nNormandin & Co.'s sparkling Sauternes cuvée. This colombar grape is\r\nsimply the semillon--one of the leading varieties of the Sauternes\r\ndistrict--transported to the Charente. The remarkably cool cellars\r\nwhere the firm store their wine, whether in wood or bottle, have been\r\nformed from some vast subterranean galleries whence centuries ago stone\r\nwas quarried, and which are situated about a quarter of an hour's drive\r\nfrom Châteauneuf, in the midst of vineyards and cornfields. The wine is\r\ninvariably bottled in a cellier at the head establishment, but it is\r\nin these cellars where it goes through the course of careful treatment\r\nsimilar to that pursued with regard to Champagne.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn order that the delicate flavour of the wine may be preserved, the\r\nliqueur is prepared with the finest old Sauternes, without any addition\r\nof spirit, and the dose is administered with the most improved modern\r\nappliance, constructed of silver, and provided with crystal taps. At\r\nthe Concours Régional d'Angoulême of 1877, the jury, after recording\r\nthat they had satisfied themselves by the aid of a chemical analysis\r\nthat the samples of sparkling Sauternes submitted to their judgment\r\nwere free from any foreign ingredient, awarded to Messrs. Normandin &\r\nCo. the only gold medal given in the Group of Alimentary Products.\r\n\r\nEncouraged, no doubt, by the success obtained by Messrs. Normandin &\r\nCo. with their sparkling Sauternes, the house of Lermat-Robert & Co.,\r\nof Bordeaux, introduced a few years ago a sparkling Barsac, samples of\r\nwhich were submitted to the jury at the Paris Exhibition of 1878.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINTAGER OF THE CÔTE D'OR.]\r\n\r\n[Illustration: VINTAGER OF THE JURA.]\r\n\r\n                                  II.\r\n\r\n     /The Sparkling Wines of Burgundy, the Jura, and the South of\r\n                               France./\r\n\r\n    Sparkling wines of the Côte d'Or at the Paris Exhibition of\r\n    1878--Chambertin, Romanée, and Vougeot--Burgundy wines and\r\n    vines formerly presents from princes--Vintaging sparkling\r\n    Burgundies--Their after-treatment in the cellars--Excess\r\n    of breakage--Similarity of proceeding to that followed\r\n    in the Champagne--Principal manufacturers of sparkling\r\n    Burgundies--Sparkling wines of Tonnerre, the birthplace of the\r\n    Chevalier d'Eon--The Vin d'Arbanne of Bar-sur-Aube--Death there\r\n    of the Bastard de Bourbon--Madame de la Motte's ostentatious\r\n    display and arrest there--Sparkling wines of the Beaujolais--The\r\n    Mont-Brouilly vineyards--Ancient reputation of the wines of the\r\n    Jura--The Vin Jaune of Arbois beloved of Henri Quatre--Rhymes\r\n    by him in its honour--Lons-le-Saulnier--Vineyards yielding\r\n    the sparkling Jura wines--Their vintaging and subsequent\r\n    treatment--Their high alcoholic strength and general\r\n    drawbacks--Sparkling wines of Auvergne, Guienne, Dauphiné,\r\n    and Languedoc--Sparkling Saint-Péray the Champagne of the\r\n    South--Valence, with its reminiscences of Pius VI. and Napoleon\r\n    I.--The 'Horns of Crussol' on the banks of the Rhône--Vintage\r\n    scene at Saint-Péray--The vines and vineyards producing\r\n    sparkling wine--Manipulation of sparkling Saint-Péray--Its\r\n    abundance of natural sugar--The cellars of M. de Saint-Prix,\r\n    and samples of his wines--Sparkling Côte-Rotie, Château-Grillé,\r\n    and Hermitage--Annual production and principal markets of\r\n    sparkling Saint-Péray--Clairette de Die--The Porte Rouge of Die\r\n    Cathedral--How the Die wine is made--The sparkling white and\r\n    rose-coloured muscatels of Die--Sparkling wines of Vercheny and\r\n    Lagrasse--Barnave and the royal flight to Varennes--Narbonne\r\n    formerly a miniature Rome, now noted merely for its wine and\r\n    honey--Fête of the Black Virgin at Limoux--Preference given to the\r\n    new wine over the miraculous water--Blanquette of Limoux, and how\r\n    it is made--Characteristics of this overrated wine.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nSparkling wines are made to a considerable extent in Burgundy,\r\nnotably at Beaune, Nuits, and Dijon; and though as a rule heavier\r\nand more potent than the subtile and delicate-flavoured wines of the\r\nMarne, still some of the higher qualities, both of the red and white\r\nvarieties, exhibit a degree of refinement which those familiar only\r\nwith the commoner kinds can scarcely form an idea of. At the Paris\r\nExhibition of 1878 we tasted, among a large collection of the sparkling\r\nwines of the Côte d'Or, samples of Chambertin, Romanée, and Vougeot,\r\nof the highest order. Although red wines, they had the merit of being\r\ndeficient in that body which forms such an objectionable feature in\r\nsparkling wines of a deep shade of colour. M. Regnier, the exhibitor\r\nof sparkling red Vougeot, sent, moreover, a white sparkling wine, from\r\nthe species of grape known locally as the clos blanc de Vougeot. These\r\nwines, as well as the Chambertin, came from the Côte de Nuits, the\r\ngrowths of which are generally considered of too vigorous a type for\r\nsuccessful conversion into sparkling wine, preference being usually\r\ngiven to the produce of the Côte de Beaune. Among the sparkling\r\nBurgundies from the last-named district were samples from Savigny,\r\nChassagne, and Meursault, all famous for their fine white wines.\r\n\r\nBurgundy ranks as one of the oldest viticultural regions of Central\r\nEurope, and for centuries its wines have been held in the highest\r\nrenown. In the Middle Ages both the wines and vines of this favoured\r\nprovince passed as presents from one royal personage to another, just\r\nas grand _cordons_ are exchanged between them nowadays. The fabrication\r\nof sparkling wine, however, dates no further back than some sixty years\r\nor so. The system of procedure is much the same as in the Champagne,\r\nand, as there, the wine is mainly the produce of the pineau noir and\r\npineau blanc varieties of grape. At the vintage, in order to avoid\r\nbruising the ripened fruit and to guard against premature fermentation,\r\nthe grapes are conveyed to the pressoirs in baskets, instead of the\r\nlarge oval vats termed _balonges_, common to the district. They\r\nare placed beneath the press as soon as possible, and for superior\r\nsparkling wines only the juice resulting from the first pressure,\r\nand known as the _mère goutte_, or mother drop, is employed. For the\r\nordinary wines, that expressed at the second squeezing of the fruit is\r\nmingled with the other. The must is at once run off into casks, which\r\nhave been previously sulphured, to check, in a measure, the ardour\r\nof the first fermentation, and lighten the colour of the newly-made\r\nwine. Towards the end of October, when this first fermentation is\r\nover, the wine is removed to the cellars, or to some other cool place,\r\nand in December it is racked into other casks. In the April following\r\nit is again racked, to insure its being perfectly clear at the epoch\r\nof bottling in the month of May. The sulphuring of the original\r\ncasks having had the effect of slightly checking the fermentation\r\nand retaining a certain amount of saccharine in the wine, it is only\r\non exceptional occasions that the latter is artificially sweetened\r\nprevious to being bottled.\r\n\r\nA fortnight after the tirage the wine commonly attains the stage known\r\nas _grand mousseux_, and by the end of September the breakage will\r\nhave amounted to between 5 and 8 per cent, which necessitates the\r\ntaking down the stacks of bottles and piling them up anew. The wine\r\nas a rule remains in the cellars for fully a couple of years from the\r\ntime of bottling until it is shipped. Posing the bottles _sur pointe_,\r\nagitating them daily, together with the disgorging and liqueuring of\r\nthe wine, are accomplished precisely as in the Champagne.\r\n\r\nAmong the principal manufacturers of sparkling Burgundies are Messrs.\r\nAndré & Voillot, of Beaune, whose sparkling white Romanée, Nuits, and\r\nVolnay are well and favourably known in England; M. Louis Latour, also\r\nof Beaune, and equally noted for his sparkling red Volnay, Nuits, and\r\nChambertin, as for his sparkling white varieties; Messrs. Maire et\r\nFils, likewise of Beaune; M. Labouré-Goutard and Messrs. Geisweiller et\r\nFils, of Nuits; Messrs. Marey & Liger-Belair, of Nuits and Vosne; and\r\nM. Regnier, of Dijon.\r\n\r\nIn the department of the Yonne--that is, in Lower Burgundy--sparkling\r\nwines somewhat alcoholic in character have been made for the last half\r\ncentury at Tonnerre, where the Chevalier d'Eon, that enigma of his\r\nepoch, was born. The Tonnerre vineyards are of high antiquity, and\r\nfor sparkling wines the produce of the black and white pineau and the\r\nwhite morillon varieties of grape is had recourse to. The vintaging is\r\naccomplished with great care, and only the juice which flows from the\r\nfirst pressure is employed. This is run off immediately into casks,\r\nwhich are hermetically closed when the fermentation has subsided. The\r\nafter-treatment of the wine is the same as in the Champagne. Sparkling\r\nwines are likewise made at Epineuil, a village in the neighbourhood\r\nof Tonnerre, and at Chablis, so famous for its white wines, about ten\r\nmiles distant.\r\n\r\nAn effervescing wine known as the Vin d'Arbanne is made at\r\nBar-sur-Aube, some fifty miles north-east of Tonnerre, on the borders\r\nof Burgundy, but actually in the province of Champagne, although far\r\nbeyond the limits to which the famed viticultural district extends.\r\nIt was at Bar-sur-Aube where the Bastard de Bourbon, chief of the\r\nsanguinary gang of _écorcheurs_ (flayers), was sewn up in a sack and\r\nflung over the parapet of the old stone bridge into the river beneath,\r\nby order of Charles VII.; and here, too, Madame de la Motte, of Diamond\r\nNecklace notoriety, was married, and in after years made a parade\r\nof the ill-gotten wealth she had acquired by successfully fooling\r\nthat infatuated libertine the Cardinal Prince de Rohan, until her\r\nostentatious display was cut short by her arrest. This Vin d'Arbanne\r\nis produced from pineaux and white gamay grapes, which, after being\r\ngathered with care at the moment the dew falls, are forthwith pressed.\r\nThe wine is left on its lees until the following February, when it is\r\nracked and fined, the bottling taking place when the moon is at the\r\nfull in March.\r\n\r\nRed and white sparkling wines are made to a small extent at\r\nSaint-Lager, in the Beaujolais, from wine vintaged in the Mont-Brouilly\r\nvineyards, one of the best known of the Beaujolais crus. Mont-Brouilly\r\nis a lofty hill near the village of Cercie, and is covered from base to\r\nsummit on all its sides with vines of the gamay species, rarely trained\r\nat all, but left to trail along the ground at their own sweet will. At\r\nthe vintage, as we witnessed it, men and women--young, middle-aged,\r\nand old--accompanied by troops of children, were roaming all over\r\nthe slopes dexterously nipping off the bunches of grapes with their\r\nthumb and finger nails, and flinging them into the little wooden tubs\r\nwith which they were provided. The pressing of the grapes and the\r\nafter-treatment of the wine destined to become sparkling are the same\r\nin the Beaujolais as in Upper and Lower Burgundy.\r\n\r\nThe red, straw, and yellow wines of the Jura have long had a high\r\nreputation in the East of France, and the _Vin Jaune_ of Arbois, an\r\nancient fortified town on the banks of the Cuisance, besieged and\r\nsacked in turn by Charles of Amboise, Henri IV., and Louis XIV., was\r\none of the favourite beverages of the tippling Béarnais who styled\r\nhimself Seigneur of Ay and Gonesse, and who acquired his liking for\r\nit while sojourning during the siege of Arbois at the old Château des\r\nArsures. In one of Henri Quatre's letters to his minister Sully we find\r\nhim observing, 'I send you two bottles of Vin d'Arbois, for I know you\r\ndo not detest it.' A couple of other bottles of the same wine are said\r\nto have cemented the king's reconciliation with Mayenne, the leader of\r\nthe League; and the lover of La Belle Gabrielle is moreover credited\r\nwith having composed at his mistress's table some doggrel rhymes in\r\nhonour of the famous Jura cru:\r\n\r\n    'Come, little page, serve us aright,\r\n        The crown is often heavy to bear;\r\n    So fill up my goblet large and light\r\n        Whenever you find a vacancy there.\r\n    This wine is surely no Christian wight,\r\n        And yet you never complaint will hear\r\n        That it's not baptised with water clear.\r\n              Down my throat I pour\r\n              The old Arbois;\r\n    And now, my lords, let us our voices raise,\r\n    And sing of Silenus and Bacchus the praise!'\r\n\r\nIn more modern times the Jura, not content with the fame of the\r\nhistoric yellow wines of Arbois and the deservedly-esteemed straw wines\r\nof Château-Châlon, has produced large quantities of sparkling wine,\r\nthe original manufacture of which commenced as far back as a century\r\nago. To-day the principal seats of the manufacture are at Arbois and\r\nLons-le-Saulnier, the latter town the capital of the department, and\r\none of the most ancient towns of France. Originally founded by the\r\nGauls on the banks of the Vallière, in a little valley bordered by\r\nlofty hills, which are to-day covered with vines, it was girded round\r\nwith fortifications by the Romans. Subsequently the Huns and the\r\nVandals pillaged it; then the French and the Burgundians repeatedly\r\ncontested its possession, and it was only definitively acquired by\r\nFrance during the reign of Louis XIV. Rouget de l'Isle, the famous\r\nauthor of the 'Marseillaise,' was born at Lons-le-Saulnier, and here\r\nalso Marshal Ney assembled and harangued his troops before marching to\r\njoin Napoleon, whom he had promised Louis XVIII. to bring back to Paris\r\nin an iron cage.\r\n\r\nThe vineyards whence the principal supplies for these sparkling wines\r\nare derived are grouped at varying distances around Lons-le-Saulnier\r\nat L'Etoile, Quintigny, Salins, Arbois, St. Laurent-la-Roche, and\r\nPupillin, with the Jura chain of mountains rising up grandly on the\r\neast. The best vineyards at L'Etoile--which lies some couple of miles\r\nfrom Lons-le-Saulnier, surrounded by hills, planted from base to\r\nsummit with vines--are La Vigne Blanche, Montmorin, and Montgenest. At\r\nQuintigny, the wines of which are less potent than those of Arbois, and\r\nonly retain their effervescent properties for a couple of years, the\r\nParidis, Prémelan, and Montmorin vineyards are held in most repute,\r\nwhile at Pupillin, where a soft agreeable wine is vintaged, the\r\nprincipal vineyards are the Faille and the Clos. The vines cultivated\r\nfor the production of sparkling wines are chiefly the savagnin, or\r\nwhite pineau, the melon of Poligny, and the poulsard, a black variety\r\nof grape held locally in much esteem.\r\n\r\nAt the vintage, which commences towards the end of October and lasts\r\nuntil the middle of the following month, all the rotten or unripe\r\ngrapes are carefully set aside, and the sound ones only submitted to\r\nthe action of a screw-press. After the must has flowed for about half\r\nan hour, the grapes are newly collected under the press and the screw\r\nagain applied. The produce of this double operation is poured into a\r\nvat termed a _sapine_, where it remains until bubbles are seen escaping\r\nthrough the _chapeau_ that forms on the surface of the liquid. The\r\nmust is then drawn off--sometimes after being fined--into casks, which\r\nthe majority of wine-growers previously impregnate with the fumes of\r\nsulphur. When in cask the wine is treated in one of two ways; either\r\nthe casks are kept constantly filled to the bunghole, causing the foam\r\nwhich rises to the surface during the fermentation to flow over, and\r\nthereby leave the wine comparatively clear, or else the casks are not\r\ncompletely filled, in which case the wine requires to be racked several\r\ntimes before it is in a condition for fining. This latter operation\r\nis effected about the commencement of February, and a second fining\r\nfollows if the first one fails to render the wine perfectly clear. At\r\nthe bottling, which invariably takes place in April, the Jura wines\r\nrarely require any addition of sugar to insure an ample effervescence.\r\nSubsequently they are treated in exactly the same manner as the\r\nvintages of the Marne are treated by the great Champagne manufacturers.\r\nIn addition to white sparkling wine, a pink variety, with natural\r\neffervescent properties, is made by mixing with the savagnin and melon\r\ngrapes a certain proportion of the poulsard species, from which the\r\nbest red wines of the Jura are produced.\r\n\r\nOne of the principal sparkling wine establishments at Lons-le-Saulnier\r\nis that of M. Auguste Devaux, founded in the year 1860. He manufactures\r\nboth sweet and dry wines, which are sold largely in France and\r\nelsewhere on the Continent, and have lately been introduced into\r\nEngland. Their alcoholic strength is equivalent to from 25° to 26°\r\nof proof spirit, being largely above the dry sparkling wines of the\r\nChampagne, which the Jura manufacturers regard as a positive advantage\r\nrather than a decided drawback, which it most undoubtedly is.\r\n\r\nBesides being too spirituous, the sparkling wines of the Jura are\r\ndeficient in refinement and delicacy. The commoner kinds, indeed,\r\nfrequently have a pronounced unpleasant flavour, due to the nature\r\nof the soil, to careless vinification, or to the inferior quality of\r\nliqueur with which the wines have been dosed. Out of some fifty samples\r\nof all ages and varieties which in my capacity of juror I tasted at\r\nthe Paris Exhibition of 1878, I cannot call to mind one that a real\r\nconnoisseur of sparkling wines would care to admit to his table.\r\n\r\nSparkling wines are made after a fashion in several of the southern\r\nprovinces of France--in Auvergne, at Clermont-Ferrand, under the shadow\r\nof the lofty Puy de Dôme; in Guienne, at Astaffort, the scene of a\r\nbloody engagement during the Wars of Religion, in which the Protestant\r\narmy was cut to pieces when about to cross the Garonne; at Nérac, where\r\nfrail Marguerite de Valois kept her dissolute Court, and Catherine de\r\nMédicis brought her flying squadron of fascinating maids-of-honour to\r\ngain over the Huguenot leaders to the Catholic cause; and at Cahors,\r\nthe Divina, or divine fountain of the Celts, and the birthplace of\r\nPope John XXII., of Clement Marot, the early French poet, and of\r\nLéon Gambetta; in Dauphiné, at Die, Saint-Chef, Saint-Péray, and\r\nLargentière--so named after some abandoned silver mines--and where the\r\nvines are cultivated against low walls rising in a series of terraces\r\nfrom the base to the summit of the lofty hills; and in Languedoc, at\r\nBrioude, where St. Vincent, the patron saint of the vine-dressers,\r\nsuffered martyrdom, and where it is the practice to expose the must of\r\nthe future sparkling wine for several nights to the dew in order to rid\r\nit of its reddish colour; also at Linardie, and, more southward still,\r\nat Limoux, whence comes the well-known effervescing Blanquette.\r\n\r\nPrincipal among the foregoing is the excellent wine of Saint-Péray,\r\ncommonly characterised as the Champagne of the South of France. The\r\nSaint-Péray vineyards border the Rhone some ten miles below the\r\nHermitage coteau--the vines of which are to-day well-nigh destroyed by\r\nthe phylloxera--but are on the opposite bank of the river. Our visit to\r\nSaint-Péray was made from Valence, in which dull southern city we had\r\nloitered in order to glance at the vast Hôtel du Gouvernement--where\r\noctogenarian Pius VI., after being spirited away a prisoner from Rome\r\nand hurried over the Alps in a litter by order of the French Directory,\r\ndrew his last breath while silently gazing across the rushing river at\r\nthe view he so much admired--and to discover the house in the Grande\r\nRue, numbered 4, in an attic of which history records that Napoleon I.,\r\nwhen a sub-lieutenant of artillery in garrison at Valence, resided, and\r\nwhich he quitted owing three and a half francs to his pastrycook.\r\n\r\nWe crossed the Rhone over one of its hundred flimsy suspension-bridges,\r\non the majority of which a notice warns you neither to smoke nor run,\r\nand were soon skirting the base of a lofty, bare, precipitous rock,\r\nwith the 'horns of Crussol,' as the peasants term two tall pointed\r\ngables of a ruined feudal château, perched at the dizzy edge, and\r\nhaving a perpendicular fall of some five or six hundred feet below. The\r\nchâteau, which formerly belonged to the Dukes of Uzès, recognised by\r\nvirtue of the extent of their domains as _premiers pairs de France_,\r\nwas not originally erected in close proximity to any such formidable\r\nprecipice. The crag on which it stands had, it seems, been blasted from\r\ntime to time for the sake of the stone, until on one unlucky occasion,\r\nwhen too heavy a charge of powder was employed, the entire side of the\r\nrock, together with a considerable portion of the château itself, were\r\nsent flying into the air. The authorities, professing to regard what\r\nremained of the edifice as an historical monument of the Middle Ages,\r\nhereupon stepped in and prohibited the quarry being worked for the\r\nfuture.\r\n\r\n[Illustration: CONVEYING GRAPES TO THE PRESS AT SAINT-PÉRAY.]\r\n\r\nPassing beneath the cliff, one wound round to the left and dived into\r\na picturesque wooded dell at the entrance to a mountain pass, then\r\ncrossed the rocky bed of a dried-up stream, and drove along an avenue\r\nof mulberry-trees, which in a few minutes conducted us to Saint-Péray,\r\nwhere one found the vintage in full operation. Carts laden with tubs\r\nfilled with white and purple grapes, around which wasps without number\r\nswarmed, were arriving from all points of the environs and crowding the\r\nnarrow streets. Any quantity of grapes were seemingly to be had for the\r\nasking, for all the pretty girls in the place were gorging themselves\r\nwith the luscious-looking fruit. In the coopers' yards brand-new casks\r\nwere ranged in rows in readiness for the newly-made wine, and through\r\nopen doorways, and in all manner of dim recesses, one caught sight of\r\nsturdy men energetically trampling the gushing grapes under their bare\r\nfeet, and of huge creaking winepresses reeking with the purple juice.\r\nIt was chiefly common red wine, of an excellent flavour, however, that\r\nwas being made in these nooks and corners, the sparkling white wine\r\nknown as Saint-Péray being manufactured in larger establishments, and\r\non more scientific principles. It is from a white species of grape\r\nknown as the petite and grosse rousette--the same which yields the\r\nwhite Hermitage--that the Champagne of the south is produced; and the\r\nvineyards where they are cultivated occupy all the more favourable\r\nslopes immediately outside the village, the most noted being the\r\nCoteau-Gaillard, Solignacs, Thioulet, and Hungary.\r\n\r\nAlthough there is a close similarity between the manufacture of\r\nChampagne and the effervescing wine of Saint-Péray, there are still\r\none or two noteworthy variations. For a wine to be sparkling it is\r\nrequisite that it should ferment in the bottle, a result obtained by\r\nbottling it while it contains a certain undeveloped proportion of\r\nalcohol and carbonic acid, represented by so much sugar, of which\r\nthey are the component parts. This ingredient has frequently to be\r\nadded to the Champagne wines to render them sparkling, but the wine\r\nof Saint-Péray in its natural state contains so much sugar that any\r\naddition would be deleterious. This excess of saccharine enables the\r\nmanufacturer to dispense with some of the operations necessary to the\r\nfabrication of Champagne, which, after fermenting in the cask, requires\r\na second fermentation to be provoked in the bottle, whereas the\r\nSaint-Péray wine ferments only once, being bottled immediately it comes\r\nfrom the wine-press.\r\n\r\nThe deposit in the wine after being impelled towards the neck of the\r\nbottle is got rid of by following the same system as is pursued in the\r\nChampagne, but no liqueur whatever is subsequently added to the wine.\r\nOn the other hand, it is a common practice to reduce the over-sweetness\r\nof sparkling Saint-Péray in years when the grapes are more than usually\r\nripe by mixing with it some old dry white wine.\r\n\r\nAt Saint-Péray we visited the cellars of M. de Saint-Prix, one of the\r\nprincipal wine-growers of the district. The samples of effervescing\r\nwine which he produced for us to taste were of a pale golden colour,\r\nof a slightly nutty flavour, and with a decided suggestion of the\r\nspirituous essence known to be concentrated in the wine, one glass of\r\nwhich will go quite as far towards elevating a person as three glasses\r\nof Champagne. Keeping the wine for a few years is said materially to\r\nimprove its quality, to the sacrifice, however, of its effervescing\r\nproperties. M. de Saint-Prix informed us that he manufactured every\r\nyear a certain quantity of sparkling Côte-Rotie, Château-Grillé,\r\nand Hermitage. The principal markets for the Saint-Péray sparkling\r\nwines--the production of which falls considerably short of a million\r\nbottles per annum--are England, Germany, Russia, Holland, and Belgium.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nThe other side of the Rhone is fruitful in minor sparkling wines,\r\nchief among which is the so-called Clairette de Die, made at the town\r\nof that name, a place of some splendour, as existing antiquities\r\nshow, in the days of the Roman dominion in Gaul. Later on, Die was\r\nthe scene of constant struggles for supremacy between its counts and\r\nbishops, one of the latter being massacred by the populace in front of\r\nthe cathedral doorway--ever since known by the sinister appellation\r\nof the Porte Rouge--and Catholics and Huguenots alike devastated the\r\ntown in the troublesome times of the Reformation. Clairette de Die is\r\nmade principally from the blanquette or malvoisie variety of grape,\r\nwhich, after the stalks have been removed, is both trodden with the\r\nfeet and pressed. The must is run off immediately into casks, and\r\nfour-and-twenty hours later it is racked into other casks, a similar\r\noperation being performed every two or three days for the period\r\nof a couple of months, when, the fermentation having subsided, the\r\nwine is fined and usually bottled in the following March. Newly-made\r\nClairette de Die is a sweet sparkling wine, but it loses its natural\r\neffervescence after a couple of years, unless it has been treated in\r\nthe same manner as Champagne, which is rarely the case. The wine enjoys\r\na reputation altogether beyond its merits.\r\n\r\nIn addition to the well-known Clairette, some of the wine-growers\r\nof Die make sparkling white and rose-coloured muscatels of superior\r\nquality, which retain their effervescing properties for several years.\r\nA sparkling wine is also made some ten miles from Die, on the road to\r\nSaillans, in a district bounded on the one side by the waters of the\r\nDrôme, and on the other by strange mountains with helmet-shaped crests.\r\nThe centre of production is a locality called Vercheny, composed of\r\nseveral hamlets, one of which, named Le Temple, was the original\r\nhome of the family of Barnave. The impressionable young deputy to\r\nthe National Assembly formed one of the trio sent to bring back the\r\nFrench royal family from Varennes after their flight from Paris. It\r\nwill be remembered how, under the influence of Marie Antoinette and\r\nMadame Elizabeth, Barnave became transformed during the journey into a\r\nfaithful partisan of their unhappy cause, and that he eventually paid\r\nthe penalty of his devotion with his life.\r\n\r\nIn the extreme south of France, and almost under the shadow of the\r\nPyrenees, a sparkling wine of some repute is made at a place called\r\nLagrasse, about five-and-twenty miles westward of Narbonne, the\r\nonce-famous Mediterranean city, the maritime rival of Marseilles, and\r\nin its palmy days, prior to the Christian era, a miniature Rome, with\r\nits capitol, its curia, its decemvirs, its consuls, its prætors, its\r\nquestors, its censors, and its ediles, and which boasted of being the\r\nbirthplace of three Roman Emperors. To-day Narbonne has to content\r\nitself with the humble renown derived from its delicious honey and\r\nits characterless full-bodied wines. Limoux, so celebrated for its\r\nBlanquette, lies a long way farther to the west, behind the Corbières\r\nrange of mountains that join on to the Pyrenees, and the jagged peaks,\r\ndeep barren gorges, and scarred sides of which have been witness of\r\nmany a desperate struggle during the century and a half when they\r\nformed the boundary between France and Spain.\r\n\r\nWe arrived at Limoux just too late for the famous _fête_ of the Black\r\nVirgin, which lasts three weeks, and attracts crowds of southern\r\npilgrims to the chapel of Our Lady of Marseilles, perched on a little\r\nhill some short distance from the town, with a fountain half-way up,\r\nwhose water issues drop by drop, and has the credit of possessing\r\nunheard-of virtues. The majority of pilgrims, however, exhibit a\r\ndecided preference for the new-made wine over the miraculous water, and\r\nfor one-and-twenty days something like a carnival of inebriety prevails\r\nat Limoux.\r\n\r\nBlanquette de Limoux derives its name from the species of grape it is\r\nproduced from, and which we believe to be identical with the malvoisie,\r\nor malmsey. Its long-shaped berries grow in huge bunches, and dry\r\nreadily on the stalks. The fruit is gathered as tenderly as possible,\r\ncare being taken that it shall not be in the slightest degree bruised,\r\nand is then spread out upon a floor to admit of whatever sugar it\r\ncontains becoming perfect. The bad grapes having been carefully picked\r\nout, and the seeds extracted from the remaining fruit, the latter is\r\nnow trodden, and the must, after being filtered through a strainer, is\r\nplaced in casks, where it remains fermenting for about a week, during\r\nwhich time any overflow is daily replenished by other must reserved for\r\nthe purpose. The wine is again clarified, and placed in fresh casks\r\nwith the bungholes only lightly closed until all sensible fermentation\r\nhas ceased, when they are securely fastened up. The bottling takes\r\nplace in the month of March, and the wine is subsequently treated much\r\nafter the same fashion as sparkling Saint-Péray, excepting that it is\r\ngenerally found necessary to repeat the operation of _dégorgement_\r\nthree, if not as many as four, times.\r\n\r\nBlanquette de Limoux is a pale white wine, the saccharine properties\r\nof which have become completely transformed into carbonic acid gas\r\nand alcohol. It is consequently both dry and spirituous, deficient in\r\ndelicacy, and altogether proves a great disappointment. At its best it\r\nmay, perhaps, rank with sparkling Saint-Péray, but unquestionably not\r\nwith an average Champagne.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration: PREPARING THE CHAMPAGNE LIQUEUR.]\r\n\r\n                                 III.\r\n\r\n             /Facts and Notes respecting Sparkling Wines./\r\n\r\n    Dry and sweet Champagnes--Their sparkling properties--Form\r\n    of Champagne glasses--Style of sparkling wines consumed in\r\n    different countries--The colour and alcoholic strength of\r\n    Champagne--Champagne approved of by the faculty--Its use in\r\n    nervous derangements--The icing of Champagne--Scarcity of grand\r\n    vintages in the Champagne--The quality of the wine has little\r\n    influence on the price--Prices realised by the Ay and Verzenay\r\n    crus in grand years--Suggestions for laying down Champagnes of\r\n    grand vintages--The improvement they develop after a few years--The\r\n    wine of 1874--The proper kind of cellar in which to lay down\r\n    Champagne--Advantages of Burrow's patent slider wine-bins--Increase\r\n    in the consumption of Champagne--Tabular statement of stocks,\r\n    exports, and home consumption from 1844-5 to 1877-8--When to serve\r\n    Champagne at a dinner-party--Charles Dickens's dictum that its\r\n    proper place is at a ball--Advantageous effect of Champagne at an\r\n    ordinary British dinner-party.\r\n\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\nIn selecting a sparkling wine, one fact should be borne in mind--that\r\njust as, according to Sam Weller, it is the seasoning which makes the\r\npie mutton, beef, or veal, so it is the liqueur which renders the\r\nwine dry or sweet, light or strong. A really palatable dry Champagne,\r\nemitting the fragrant bouquet which distinguishes all wines of fine\r\nquality, free from added spirit, is obliged to be made of the very\r\nbest _vin brut_, to which necessarily an exceedingly small percentage\r\nof liqueur will be added. On the other hand, a sweet Champagne can be\r\nproduced from the most ordinary raw wine--the Yankees even claim to\r\nhave evolved it from petroleum--as the amount of liqueur it receives\r\ncompletely masks its original character and flavour. This excess of\r\nsyrup, it should be remarked, contributes materially to the wine's\r\nexplosive force and temporary effervescence; but shortly after the\r\nbottle has been uncorked the wine becomes disagreeably flat. A fine dry\r\nwine, indebted as it is for its sparkling properties to the natural\r\nsweetness of the grape, does not exhibit the same sudden turbulent\r\neffervescence. It continues to sparkle, however, for a long time after\r\nbeing poured into the glass, owing to the carbonic acid having been\r\nabsorbed by the wine itself instead of being accumulated in the vacant\r\nspace between the liquid and the cork, as is the case with wines\r\nthat have been highly liqueured. Even when its carbonic acid gas is\r\nexhausted, a good Champagne will preserve its fine flavour, which the\r\neffervescence will have assisted to conceal. Champagne, it should be\r\nnoted, sparkles best in tall tapering glasses; still these have their\r\ndisadvantages, promoting, as they do, an excess of froth when the wine\r\nis poured into them, and almost preventing any bouquet which the wine\r\npossesses from being recognised.\r\n\r\nManufacturers of Champagne and other sparkling wines prepare them\r\ndry or sweet, light or strong, according to the markets for which\r\nthey are designed. The sweet wines go to Russia and Germany--the\r\nsweet-toothed Muscovite regarding M. Louis Roederer's syrupy product\r\nas the _beau-idéal_ of Champagne, and the Germans demanding wines with\r\ntwenty or more per cent of liqueur, or nearly quadruple the quantity\r\nthat is contained in the average Champagnes shipped to England. France\r\nconsumes light and moderately sweet wines; the United States gives a\r\npreference to the intermediate qualities; China, India, and other hot\r\ncountries stipulate for light dry wines; while the very strong ones\r\ngo to Australia, the Cape, and other places where gold and diamonds\r\nand suchlike trifles are from time to time 'prospected.' Not merely\r\nthe driest, but the very best, wines of the best manufacturers, and\r\ncommanding of course the highest prices, are invariably reserved for\r\nthe English market. Foreigners cannot understand the marked preference\r\nshown in England for exceedingly dry sparkling wines. They do not\r\nconsider that as a rule they are drunk during dinner with the _plats_,\r\nand not at dessert, with all kinds of sweets, fruits, and ices, as is\r\nalmost invariably the case abroad.\r\n\r\nGood Champagne is usually of a pale straw colour, but with nothing\r\nof a yellow tinge about it. When its tint is pinkish, this is owing\r\nto a portion of the colouring matter having been extracted from the\r\nskins of the grapes--a contingency which every pains are taken to\r\navoid, although, since the success achieved by the wine of 1874,\r\nslightly pink wines are likely to be the fashion. The positive pink or\r\nrose-coloured Champagnes, such as were in fashion some thirty years\r\nago, are simply tinted with a small quantity of deep-red wine. The\r\nalcoholic strength of the drier wines ranges from eighteen degrees of\r\nproof spirit upwards, or slightly above the ordinary Bordeaux, and\r\nunder all the better-class Rhine wines. Champagnes, when loaded with\r\na highly alcoholised liqueur, will, however, at times mark as many as\r\nthirty degrees of proof spirit. The lighter and drier the sparkling\r\nwine, the more wholesome it is, the saccharine element in conjunction\r\nwith alcohol being not only difficult of digestion, but generally\r\ndetrimental to health.\r\n\r\nThe faculty are agreed that fine dry Champagnes, consumed in\r\nmoderation, are among the safest wines that can be partaken of. Any\r\nintoxicating effects are rapid but exceedingly transient, and arise\r\nfrom the alcohol suspended in the carbonic acid being applied rapidly\r\nand extensively to the surface of the stomach. 'Champagne,' said\r\nCurran, 'simply gives a runaway rap at a man's head.' Dr. Druitt,\r\nequally distinguished by his studies upon wine and his standing as\r\na physician, pronounces good Champagne to be 'a true stimulant to\r\nbody and mind alike--rapid, volatile, transitory, and harmless.\r\nAmongst the maladies that are benefited by it,' remarks he, 'is the\r\ntrue neuralgia--intermitting fits of excruciating pain running along\r\ncertain nerves, without inflammation of the affected part, often a\r\nconsequence of malaria, or of some other low and exhausting causes.\r\nTo enumerate the cases in which Champagne is of service would be to\r\ngive a whole nosology. Who does not know the misery, the helplessness\r\nof that abominable ailment influenza, whether a severe cold or the\r\ngenuine epidemic? Let the faculty dispute about the best remedy if they\r\nplease; but a sensible man with a bottle of Champagne will beat them\r\nall. Moreover, whenever there is pain, with exhaustion and lowness,\r\nthen Dr. Champagne should be had up. There is something excitant in the\r\nwine--doubly so in the sparkling wine, which, the moment it touches\r\nthe lips, sends an electric telegram of comfort to every remote nerve.\r\nNothing comforts and rests the stomach better, or is a greater antidote\r\nto nausea.'\r\n\r\nChampagne of fine quality should never be mixed with ice or iced water;\r\nneither should it be iced to the extent Champagnes ordinarily are; for,\r\nin the first place, the natural lightness of the wine is such as not\r\nto admit of its being diluted without utterly spoiling it, and in the\r\nnext, excessive cold destroys alike the fragrant bouquet of the wine\r\nand its delicate vinous flavour. Really good Champagne should not be\r\niced below a temperature of fifty degrees Fahr.; whereas exceedingly\r\nsweet wines will bear icing down almost to freezing point, and be\r\nrendered more palatable by the process. The above remarks apply to all\r\nsorts of sparkling wine.\r\n\r\nIn the Champagne, what may be termed a really grand vintage commonly\r\noccurs only once, and never more than twice, in ten years. During\r\nthe same period, however, there will generally be one or two other\r\ntolerably good vintages. In grand years the crop, besides being of\r\nsuperior quality, is usually abundant, and as a consequence the price\r\nof the raw wine is scarcely higher than usual. Apparently from this\r\ncircumstance the sparkling wine of grand vintages does not command an\r\nenhanced value, as is the case with other fine wines. It is only when\r\nspeculators recklessly outbid each other for the grapes or the _vin\r\nbrut_, or when stocks are low and the _vin brut_ is really scarce, that\r\nthe price of Champagne appears to rise.\r\n\r\nThat superior quality does not involve enhanced price is proved by the\r\namounts paid for the Ay and Verzenay crus in years of grand vintages.\r\nDuring the present century these appear to have been 1802, '06, '11,\r\n'18, '22, '25, '34, '42, '46, '57, '65, '68, and '74--that is, thirteen\r\ngrand vintages in eighty years. Other good vintages, although not\r\nequal to the foregoing, occurred in the years 1815, '32, '39, '52,\r\n'54, '58, '62, '64, and '70. Confining ourselves to the grand years,\r\nwe find that the Ay wine of 1834, owing to the crop being plentiful\r\nas well as good, only realised from 110 to 140 francs the pièce of 44\r\ngallons, although for two years previously this had fetched them 150 to\r\n200 francs. In 1842 the price ranged from 120 to 150 francs, whereas\r\nthe vastly inferior wine of the year before had commanded from 210 to\r\n275 francs. In 1846, the crop being a small one, the price of the wine\r\nrose, and in 1857 the pièce fetched as much as from 480 to 500 francs;\r\nstill this was merely a trifle higher than it had realised the two\r\npreceding years. In 1865 the price was 380 to 400 francs, and in 1868\r\nabout the same, whereas the indifferent vintages of 1871, '72, and\r\n'73--the latter eventually proved to be of execrable quality--realised\r\nfrom 500 to 1000 francs the pièce. It was very similar with the wine of\r\nVerzenay. In 1834 the price of the pièce ranged from 280 to 325 francs,\r\nor about the average of the three preceding years. In 1846, the crop\r\nbeing scarce, the price rose considerably; while in 1857, when the crop\r\nwas plentiful, it fell to 500 francs, or from 5 to 20 per cent below\r\nthat of the two previous years, when the yield was both inferior and\r\nless abundant. In 1865 the price rose 33 per cent above that of the\r\nyear before; still, although Verzenay wine of 1865 and 1868 fetched\r\nfrom 420 to 450 francs the pièce, and that of 1874 as much as 900\r\nfrancs, the greatly inferior vintages of 1872-73 commanded 900 and 1030\r\nfrancs the pièce. Subsequently the price of the wine fell to 350 and\r\n450 francs the pièce, to rise again, however, in 1878 to 900 francs,\r\nwhich was followed by a fall the following year to 250 francs. In 1880,\r\nwhen the yield was no more than the quarter of an average one, and the\r\nquality was as yet undetermined, the Ay and Verzenay wines commanded\r\nthe high price of 1500 francs and upwards the pièce. Exceptionally high\r\nprices were also realised for the wines of the neighbouring localities.\r\n\r\nConsumers of Champagne, if wise, would profit by the circumstance that\r\nquality has not the effect of causing a rise in prices, and if they\r\nwere bent upon drinking their favourite wine in perfection, as one\r\nmeets with it at the dinner-tables of the principal manufacturers,\r\nwho only put old wine of grand vintages before their guests, they\r\nwould lay down Champagnes of good years in the same way as the choicer\r\nvintages of port, burgundy, and bordeaux are laid down. The Champagne\r\nof 1874 was a wine of this description, with all its finer vinous\r\nqualities well developed, and consequently needing age to attain not\r\nmerely the roundness, but the refinement, of flavour pertaining to a\r\nhigh-class sparkling wine. Instead of being drunk a few months after\r\nit was shipped in the spring and summer of 1877, as was the fate of\r\nmuch of the wine in question, it needed being kept for three years at\r\nthe very least to become even moderately round and perfect. In the\r\nChampagne one had many opportunities of tasting the grander vintages\r\nthat had arrived at ten, twelve, or fifteen years of age, and had\r\nthereby attained supreme excellence. It is true their effervescence had\r\nmoderated materially, but their bouquet and flavour were perfect, and\r\ntheir softness and delicacy something marvellous.\r\n\r\nA great wine like that of 1874 will go on improving for ten years,\r\nproviding it is only laid down under proper conditions. These are,\r\nfirst, an exceedingly cool but perfectly dry cellar, the temperature\r\nof which should be as low as from 50° to 55° Fahr., or even lower if\r\nthis is practicable. The cellar, too, should be neither over dark nor\r\nlight, scrupulously clean, and sufficiently well ventilated for the\r\nair to be continuously pure. It is requisite that the bottles should\r\nrest on their sides, to prevent the corks shrinking, and thus allowing\r\nboth the carbonic acid and the wine itself to escape. For laying down\r\nChampagne or any kind of sparkling wine, an iron wine-bin is by far\r\nthe best; and the patent 'slider' bins made by Messrs. W. & J. Burrow,\r\nof Malvern, are better adapted to the purpose than any other. In these\r\nthe bottles rest on horizontal parallel bars of wrought-iron, securely\r\nriveted into strong wrought-iron uprights, both at the back and in\r\nfront. They are especially adapted for laying down Champagne, as they\r\nadmit of the air circulating freely around the bottles, thus conducing\r\nto the preservation of the metal foil round their necks, and keeping\r\nthe temperature of the wine both cool and equable.\r\n\r\nFrom the subjoined table it will be seen that the consumption of\r\nChampagne has more than quadrupled since the year 1844-5, a period\r\nof six-and-thirty years. A curious fact to note is the immense\r\nincrease in the exports of the wine during the three years following\r\nthe Franco-German war, during which contest both the exports and\r\nhome consumption of Champagne naturally fell off very considerably.\r\nNo reliable information is available as to the actual quantity of\r\nChampagne consumed yearly in England, but this may be taken in round\r\nnumbers at about four millions of bottles. The consumption of the wine\r\nin the United States varies from rather more than a million and a half\r\nto nearly two million bottles annually.\r\n\r\nOFFICIAL RETURN BY THE CHAMBER OF COMMERCE AT REIMS OF THE TRADE IN\r\nCHAMPAGNE WINES FROM APRIL 1844 TO APRIL 1881.\r\n\r\n  +-----------+--------------+------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n  |Years--from|              | Number of  |  Number of  |    Total    |\r\n  |  April    |Manufacturers'|  Bottles   |Bottles sold |  Number of  |\r\n  | to April. |   Stocks.    | exported.  | in France.  |Bottles sold.|\r\n  +-----------+--------------+------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n  | 1844-45   |  23,285,218  |  4,380,214 |  2,255,438  |  6,635,652  |\r\n  | 1845-46   |  22,847,971  |  4,505,308 |  2,510,605  |  7,015,913  |\r\n  | 1846-47   |  18,815,367  |  4,711,915 |  2,355,366  |  7,067,281  |\r\n  | 1847-48   |  23,122,994  |  4,859,625 |  2,092,571  |  6,952,196  |\r\n  | 1848-49   |  21,290,185  |  5,686,484 |  1,473,966  |  7,160,450  |\r\n  | 1849-50   |  20,499,192  |  5,001,044 |  1,705,735  |  6,706,779  |\r\n  | 1850-51   |  20,444,915  |  5,866,971 |  2,122,569  |  7,989,540  |\r\n  | 1851-52   |  21,905,479  |  5,957,552 |  2,162,880  |  8,120,432  |\r\n  | 1852-53   |  19,376,967  |  6,355,574 |  2,385,217  |  8,740,790  |\r\n  | 1853-54   |  17,757,769  |  7,878,320 |  2,528,719  | 10,407,039  |\r\n  | 1854-55   |  20,922,959  |  5,895,773 |  2,452,743  |  9,348,516  |\r\n  | 1855-56   |  15,957,141  |  7,137,001 |  2,562,039  |  9,699,040  |\r\n  | 1856-57   |  15,228,294  |  8,490,198 |  2,468,818  | 10,959,016  |\r\n  | 1857-58   |  21,628,778  |  7,368,310 |  2,421,454  |  9,789,764  |\r\n  | 1858-59   |  28,328,251  |  7,666,633 |  2,805,416  | 10,472,049  |\r\n  | 1859-60   |  35,648,124  |  8,265,395 |  3,039,621  | 11,305,016  |\r\n  | 1860-61   |  30,235,260  |  8,488,223 |  2,697,508  | 11,185,731  |\r\n  | 1861-62   |  30,254,291  |  6,904,915 |  2,592,875  |  9,497,790  |\r\n  | 1862-63   |  28,013,189  |  7,937,836 |  2,767,371  | 10,705,207  |\r\n  | 1863-64   |  28,466,975  |  9,851,138 |  2,934,996  | 12,786,134  |\r\n  | 1864-65   |  33,298,672  |  9,101,441 |  2,801,626  | 11,903,067  |\r\n  | 1865-66   |  34,175,429  | 10,413,455 |  2,782,777  | 13,196,132  |\r\n  | 1866-67   |  37,608,716  | 10,283,886 |  3,218,343  | 13,502,229  |\r\n  | 1867-68   |  37,969,219  | 10,876,585 |  2,924,268  | 13,800,853  |\r\n  | 1868-69   |  32,490,881  | 12,810,194 |  3,104,496  | 15,914,690  |\r\n  | 1869-70   |  39,272,562  | 13,858,839 |  3,628,461  | 17,487,300  |\r\n  | 1870-71   |  39,984,003  |  7,544,323 |  1,633,941  |  9,178,264  |\r\n  | 1871-72   |  40,099,243  | 17,001,124 |  3,367,537  | 20,368,661  |\r\n  | 1872-73   |  45,329,490  | 18,917,779 |  3,464,059  | 22,381,838  |\r\n  | 1873-74   |  46,573,974  | 18,106,310 |  2,491,759  | 20,598,069  |\r\n  | 1874-75   |  52,733,674  | 15,318,345 |  3,517,182  | 18,835,527  |\r\n  | 1875-76   |  64,658,767  | 16,705,719 |  2,439,762  | 19,145,481  |\r\n  | 1876-77   |  71,398,726  | 15,882,964 |  3,127,991  | 19,010,955  |\r\n  | 1877-78   |  70,183,863  | 15,711,651 |  2,450,983  | 18,162,634  |\r\n  | 1878-79   |  65,813,194  | 14,844,181 |  2,596,356  | 17,440,537  |\r\n  | 1879-80   |  68,540,668  | 16,524,593 |  2,665,561  | 19,190,154  |\r\n  | 1880-81   |  54,505,964  | 18,220,980 |  2,330,924  | 20,551,904  |\r\n  +-----------+--------------+------------+-------------+-------------+\r\n\r\nDistinguished gourmets are scarcely agreed as to the proper moment\r\nwhen Champagne should be introduced at the dinner-table. Dyspeptic Mr.\r\nWalker, of 'The Original,' laid it down that Champagne ought to be\r\nintroduced very early at the banquet, without any regard whatever to\r\nthe viands it may chance to accompany. 'Give Champagne,' he says, 'at\r\nthe beginning of dinner, as its exhilarating qualities serve to start\r\nthe guests, after which they will seldom flag. No other wine produces\r\nan equal effect in increasing the success of a party--it invariably\r\nturns the balance to the favourable side. When Champagne goes rightly,\r\nnothing can well go wrong.' These precepts are sound enough; still\r\nall dinner-parties are not necessarily glacial, and the guests are\r\nnot invariably mutes. Before Champagne can be properly introduced at\r\na formal dinner, the conventional glass of sherry or madeira should\r\nsupplement the soup, a white French or a Rhine wine accompany the fish,\r\nand a single glass of bordeaux prepare the way with the first _entrée_\r\nfor the sparkling wine, which, for the first round or two, should be\r\nserved briskly and liberally. A wine introduced thus early at the\r\nrepast should of course be dry, or, at any rate, moderately so.\r\n\r\nWe certainly do not approve of Mr. Charles Dickens's dictum that\r\nChampagne's proper place is not at the dinner-table, but solely\r\nat a ball. 'A cavalier,' he said, 'may appropriately offer at\r\npropitious intervals a glass now and then to his danceress. There\r\nit takes its fitting rank and position amongst feathers, gauzes,\r\nlace, embroidery, ribbons, white-satin shoes, and eau-de-Cologne,\r\nfor Champagne is simply one of the elegant extras of life.' This\r\nis all very well; still the advantageous effect of sparkling wine\r\nat an ordinary British dinner-party, composed as it frequently is\r\nof people brought indiscriminately together in accordance with the\r\nexigencies of the hostess's visiting-list, cannot be gainsaid. After\r\nthe preliminary glowering at each other, _more Britannico_, in the\r\ndrawing-room, everybody regards it as a relief to be summoned to the\r\nrepast, which, however, commences as chillily as the soup and as\r\nstolidly as the salmon. The soul of the hostess is heavy with the\r\nanxiety of prospective dishes, the brow of the host is clouded with\r\nthe reflection that our rulers are bent upon adding an extra penny to\r\nthe income-tax. Placed between a young lady just out and a dowager of\r\ngrimly Gorgonesque aspect, you hesitate how to open a conversation.\r\nYour first attempts are singularly ineffectual, only eliciting a\r\ndropping fire of monosyllables. You envy the placidly languid young\r\ngentleman opposite, limp as his fast-fading camellia, and seated next\r\nto Belle Breloques, who is certain, in racing parlance, to make the\r\nrunning for him. But even that damsel seems preoccupied with her fan,\r\nand, despite her _aplomb_, hesitates to break the icy silence. The two\r\nCity friends of the host are lost in mute speculation as to the future\r\nprice of indigo or Ionian Bank shares, while their wives seem to be\r\nmentally summarising the exact cost of each other's toilettes. Their\r\ndaughters, or somebody else's daughters, are desperately jerking out\r\nmonosyllabic responses to feeble remarks concerning the weather, the\r\ntheatres, operatic _débutantes_, the people in the Row, æstheticism,\r\nand kindred topics from a couple of F.O. men. Little Snapshot, the wit,\r\non the other side of the Gorgon, has tried to lead up to a story, but\r\nhas found himself, as it were, frozen in the bud. When lo! the butler\r\nsoftly sibillates in your ear the magic word 'Champagne,' and as it\r\nflows, creaming and frothing, into your glass, a change comes over the\r\nspirit of your vision.\r\n\r\nThe hostess brightens, the host coruscates. The young lady on\r\nyour right suddenly develops into a charming girl, with becoming\r\nappreciation of your pet topics and an astounding aptness for repartee.\r\nThe Gorgon thaws, and implores Mr. Snapshot, whose jests are popping\r\nas briskly as the corks, not to be so dreadfully funny, or he will\r\npositively kill her. Belle Breloques can always talk, and now her\r\ntongue rattles faster then ever, till the languid one arouses himself\r\nlike a giant refreshed, and gives her as good as he gets. The City\r\nmen expatiate in cabalistic language on the merits of some mysterious\r\nspeculation, the prospective returns from which increase with each\r\nfresh bottle. One of their wives is discussing church decoration\r\nwith a hitherto silent curate, and the other is jabbering botany to\r\na red-faced warrior. The juniors are in full swing, and ripples of\r\nsilvery laughter rise in accompaniment to the beaded bubbles all round\r\nthe table.\r\n\r\nGradually, as people drift off from generalities to their own\r\nparticular line--gastronomy, politics, art, sport, fashion, literature,\r\nchurch matters, theatricals, speculation, scandal, dress, and the\r\nlike--the scraps of sentences that the ear catches flying about the\r\ntable present a mosaic somewhat resembling the following: 'Forster\r\nshould have sent him to Kilmainham--to see that dear delightful Mr.\r\nIrving in--ten-inch armour-plating, but could not steer in a sea-way,\r\nso--sat down in the saddle and rammed his spurs into--Petsy Prettitoes\r\nand half a dozen girls from the Cruralia, who were--ordained last week\r\nby the Bishop of London, when his lordship--said there was no doubt\r\nwho best deserved the vacant Garter, and declared--a dividend of seven\r\nper cent for the--comet year with a bouquet--of sunflowers and lilies\r\non satin, which you should--cover with a light crust--of stiff clay,\r\nwith a rasper on the further side as--the third story of the hotel\r\noverlooking--the Euphrates Valley Railway, which would lead to--the\r\nloveliest bit of landscape in the Academy--with the finest hair in the\r\nworld, and eyes like--a boiled cod's head and shoulders--cut low at the\r\nneck, with a gold shoulder-strap, and--nothing else to speak of before\r\nthe House except the Bill for--her photographs, which are in all the\r\nshop-windows, beside Mrs. Langtry's--who never ought to have allowed\r\nBismarck to--assist at the consecration of--the Henley course--so the\r\nDuke started at once for Aldershot, and reviewed--the two best novels\r\nof the season--cut up with tomatoes and a dash of garlic--and was\r\npositive he saw them dining together at Richmond on--fourteen brace of\r\nbirds and five hares in--the loveliest set of embroidered vestments\r\nand an altar-cloth worked for--a Conservative majority, which will\r\ndrive the Government to--take a couple of stalls at Her Majesty's to\r\nhear _Carmen_--who gave him the last galop, but he--blundered at his\r\nfirst fence and fell--to seventy-two and a half, whilst the preference\r\nshares were--all ordered on foreign service and--heard nothing from\r\nthe Irish members but--Oscar Wilde's poems bound in red morocco--with\r\na white-satin train and--plenty of body and a good colour--all through\r\nriding every morning in--a private box on the upper tier--and that is\r\nwhy Gladstone at once gave orders--for them to be actually shut up\r\ntogether--in the strong room of the Bank of England, with a reserve\r\nfund of bullion--from the music in the first act of _Patience_--equal\r\nto that of Job when he said--well, only half a glass, then, since\r\nyou are so pressing.' And all this is due to Champagne, that great\r\nunloosener not merely of tongues, but, better still, of purse-strings,\r\nas is well known to the secretaries of those charitable institutions\r\nwhich set the exhilarating wine flowing earliest at their anniversary\r\ndinners.\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n[Illustration]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n                               APPENDIX.\r\n\r\n\r\n    THE PRINCIPAL CHAMPAGNE AND OTHER FRENCH SPARKLING WINE BRANDS.\r\n\r\n[asterism] In this list, whenever a manufacturer has various qualities,\r\nthe higher qualities are always placed first.\r\n\r\nThe lowest qualities are omitted altogether.\r\n\r\n\r\n                            CHAMPAGNES.\r\n\r\n  Firms and Wholesale   Brands.

The sculptures still remaining under the\r\narcades have reference to the months of the year, to Romulus and Remus,\r\nand to Jupiter and Leda. Reims formerly abounded with monuments of the\r\nRoman domination. According to M. Brunette, an architect of the city,\r\nwho made its Roman remains his especial study, a vast and magnificent\r\npalace formerly stood nigh the spot now known as the Trois Piliers;\r\nwhile on the right of the road leading to the town were the arenas,\r\ntogether with a temple, among the ruins of which various sculptures,\r\nvases, and medals were found, and almost immediately opposite, on\r\nthe site of the present cemetery, an immense theatre, circus, and\r\nxystos for athletic exercises. Then came a vast circular space, in\r\nthe centre of which arose a grand triumphal arch giving entrance into\r\nthe city. The road led straight to the Forum,--the Place des Marchés\r\nof to-day,--and along it were a basilica, a market, and an exedra,\r\nnow replaced by the Hôtel de Ville. The Forum, bordered by monumental\r\nbuildings, was of gigantic proportions, extending on the one side\r\nfrom half way down the Rue Colbert to the Place Royale, and on the\r\nother from near the Marché à la Laine, parallel with the Rue de Vesle,\r\nup to the middle of the Rue des Elus, where it terminated in a vast\r\namphitheatre used for public competitions.\r\n\r\nOther buildings of less importance were situated here and there: the\r\nthermæ along the Rue du Cloître; a palace or a temple on the site of\r\nthe archiepiscopal palace; another temple at the extremity of the Rue\r\nVauthier le Noir, in the ruins of which a bas-relief and some small\r\nantique statues were discovered; a third temple in the Rue du Couchant,\r\nin which a votive altar was found. Four triumphal arches were erected\r\nat the four gates of the town: one dedicated to Mars; another to Ceres,\r\non the same site as the gate of to-day; a third to Bacchus, in the\r\npresent Rue de l'Université, in front of the Lycée; and the fourth to\r\nVenus, in the Rue de Vesle. Outside the walls, following the Rue du\r\nBarbâtre, the road was dotted with numerous graves according to the\r\nRoman custom; while on the site of the church of St. Remi there arose a\r\ntemple and a palace, and on that of St. Nicaise a vast edifice which M.\r\nBrunette supposed to be the palace of the Consul Jovinus.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 5: Henderson's _History of Ancient and Modern Wines_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 6: Gibbon's _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 7: Gibbon's _Decline and Fall of the Roman Empire_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 8: According to this document, published in Marlot's\r\n_Histoire de Reims_, he leaves to Bishop Lupus the vineyard cultivated\r\nby the vine-dresser Enias; to his nephew Agricola, the vineyard planted\r\nby Mellaricus at Laon, and also the one cultivated by Bebrimodus; to\r\nhis nephew Agathimerus, a vineyard he had himself planted at Vindonisæ,\r\nand kept up by the labour of his own episcopal hands; to Hilaire the\r\ndeaconess, the vines adjoining her own vineyard, cultivated by Catusio,\r\nand also those at Talpusciaco; and to the priests and deacons of Reims,\r\nhis vineyard in the suburbs of that city, and the vine-dresser Melanius\r\nwho cultivated it. The will is also noteworthy for its mention of a\r\nlocality destined to attain a high celebrity in connection with the\r\nwine of Champagne, namely, the town of Sparnacus or Epernay, which a\r\nlord named Eulogius, condemned to death for high treason in 499 and\r\nsaved at the bishop's intercession, had bestowed upon his benefactor,\r\nand which the latter left in turn to the church of Reims. To this\r\nchurch he also left estates in the Vosges and beyond the Rhine, on\r\ncondition of furnishing pitch every year to the religious houses\r\nfounded by himself or his predecessors to mend their wine-vessels, a\r\ntrace of the old Roman custom of pitching vessels used for storing\r\nwine.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 9: Marlot's _Histoire de Reims_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 10: Henderson's _History of Ancient and Modern Wines_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 11: Victor Fievet's _Histoire d'Epernay_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 12: Bertin du Rocheret's _Mélanges_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 13: Varin's _Archives Administratives de Reims_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 14: 'Bien met l'argent qui en bon vin l'emploie.' _Poems of\r\nColin Musset_, 1190 to 1220.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 15: Varin's _Archives Administratives de Reims_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 16: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 17: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 18: J.

A poinçon, or demi-queue,\r\nof Reims was about 48 old English, or 40 imperial, gallons; while the\r\ndemi-queue of Burgundy was over 45 imperial gallons.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 31: Varin's _Archives Administratives de Reims_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 32: A few examples of the retail price of wine throughout the\r\ncentury at Reims may here be noted. For instance, a judgment of 1303\r\nprovided that all tavern-keepers selling wine at a higher rate than\r\nsix deniers, or about a farthing per lot, the rate fixed by ancient\r\ncustom, were to pay a fine of twenty-two sous. The lot or pot, for\r\nthe two terms are indifferently used, was about the third of an old\r\nEnglish gallon, four pots making a septier, and thirty-six septiers a\r\npoinçon or demi-queue, equal to about forty-eight gallons. The queue\r\nwas therefore about ninety-six gallons at Reims, but at Epernay not\r\nmore than eighty-five gallons. Not only had every district its separate\r\nmeasures,--those of Paris, for instance, differing widely from those of\r\nReims,--but there were actually different measures used in the various\r\nlay and ecclesiastical jurisdictions into which Reims was divided.\r\n\r\nIn the accounts of the Echevinage, wine, chiefly for presents to\r\npersons of distinction, makes a continual appearance. In 1335 it is\r\nnoted that 'the presents of this year were made in wine at 16 deniers\r\nand 20 deniers the pot,' or about 2-1/4_d._ English per gallon. In\r\n1337-8 prices ranged from 3/4_d._ to 4-1/2_d._ English per gallon,\r\nshowing a variety in quality; and in 1345 large quantities were\r\npurchased at the first-mentioned rate, five quarts of white wine\r\nfetching 2_d._ English. In 1352 from a 1_d._ to 2-1/4_d._ was paid\r\nper gallon, and five crowns for two queues. In 1363 the citizens,\r\na hot-headed turbulent lot, who were always squabbling with their\r\nspiritual and temporal superior and assailing his officers, when\r\nnot assaulting each other or pulling their neighbours' houses down,\r\nsuccessfully resisted the pretensions of the archbishop to regulate\r\nthe price of wine when the cheapest was worth 12 deniers per pot,\r\nor 1-1/2_d._ per gallon. The dispute continued, and in 1367 a royal\r\ncommission was issued to the bailli of Vermandois, the king's\r\nrepresentative, to inquire into the right of the burghers to sell wine\r\nby retail at 16 deniers, as they desired. The report of the bailli was\r\nthat a queue of old French wine being worth about 20 livres, or 16_s._\r\n8_d._, and wine of Beaune and other better and stronger wines being\r\nsold in the town at higher rates, French wine might be sold as high as\r\n3-1/2d. English per gallon, and Beaune at 4-1/2_d._ The great increase\r\nin production, and consequent fall in price, is shown by the wine\r\nfound in Archbishop Richard Pique's cellar in 1389 being valued, on an\r\naverage, at only 1_s._ 6_d._ per queue.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 33: Froissart's _Chronicles_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 34: Idem.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 35: Idem.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 36: What with one kind of assessment being adopted for wine\r\nsold wholesale and another for that disposed of by retail, with one\r\nclass of dues being levied on wine for export and another on that for\r\nhome consumption, and with the fact of certain duties being in some\r\ncases payable by the buyer and in others by the seller, any attempt\r\nto summarise this section of the story of the wines of Reims would be\r\nimpossible. The difficulty is increased when it is remembered that in\r\nthe Middle Ages Reims was divided into districts, under the separate\r\njurisdictions of the eschevins, the archbishop, the chapter of the\r\ncathedral, the Abbeys of St. Remi and St. Nicaise, and the Priory of\r\nSt. Maurice, in several of which widely varying measures were employed\r\ndown to the sixteenth century, and between which there were continual\r\nsquabbles as to the rights of vinage, rouage, tonnieu, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 37: Varin's _Archives Administratives de Reims_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 38: Froissart's _Chronicles_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 39: Baron Taylor's _Reims; la Ville de Sacres_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 40: Amongst the better known are Chamery, where the\r\narchbishop had a house, vineyard, and garden, let for 3_s._ per annum,\r\nabout five _jours_ of vineyard and two _jours_ of very good vineland;\r\nMareuil, whence he drew ten hogsheads of wine annually; Rilly,\r\nVerzenay, Sillery, Attigny, &c.

Dherbès of Ay, by Dom\r\nGrossart, the last procureur of the Abbey of Hautvillers. Dom Grossart,\r\nwho had fled from France during the troublous times of the Revolution,\r\nwas at the date of the letter in his seventy-fourth year.\r\n\r\n'You know, sir, that it was the famous Dom Perignon, who was procureur\r\nof Hautvillers for forty-seven years, and who died in 1715, who\r\ndiscovered the secret of making sparkling and non-sparkling white\r\nwine, and the means of clearing it without being obliged to _dépoter_\r\nthe bottles, as is done by our great wine-merchants rather twice than\r\nonce, and by us never. Before his time one only knew how to make\r\nstraw-coloured or gray wine. In bottling wine, instead of corks of\r\ncork-wood, only tow was made use of, and this species of stopper was\r\nsaturated with oil. It was in the marriage of our wines that their\r\ngoodness consisted; and this Dom Perignon towards the end of his days\r\nbecame blind. He had instructed in his secret of fining the wines (_de\r\ncoller les vins_) a certain Brother Philip, who was for fifty years\r\nat the head of the wines of Hautvillers, and who was held in such\r\nconsideration by M. Le Tellier, Archbishop of Reims, that when this\r\nbrother went to Reims he made him come and sit at table with him. When\r\nthe vintage drew near, he (Dom Perignon) said to this brother, \"Go and\r\nbring me some grapes from the Prières, the Côtes-à-bras, the Barillets,\r\nthe Quartiers, the Clos Sainte Hélène,\" &c. Without being told from\r\nwhich vineyard these grapes came, he mentioned it, and added, \"the wine\r\nof such a vineyard must be married with that of such another,\" and\r\nnever made a mistake. To this Brother Philip succeeded a Brother André\r\nLemaire, who was for nearly forty years at the head of the cellars of\r\nHautvillers, that is to say, until the Revolution.... This brother\r\nbeing very ill, and believing himself on the point of death, confided\r\nto me the secret of clarifying the wines, for neither prior nor\r\nprocureur nor monk ever knew it. I declare to you, sir, that we never\r\ndid put sugar in our wines; you can attest this when you find yourself\r\nin company where it is spoken of.\r\n\r\nMonsieur Moët, who has become one of the _gros bonnets_ of Champagne\r\nsince 1794, when I used to sell him plenty of little baskets, will not\r\ntell you that I put sugar in our wines. I make use of it at present\r\nupon some white wines which are vintaged in certain _crûs_ of our wine\r\ndistrict. This may have led to the error.\r\n\r\n'As it costs much to _dépoter_, I am greatly surprised that no\r\nwine-merchant has as yet taken steps to learn the secret of clearing\r\nthe wine without having to _dépoter_ the bottles when once the wine has\r\nbeen put into them.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 111: Louis Perrier's _Mémoire sur le Vin de Champagne_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 112: _Mémoire_ of 1718.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 113: Ibid. Pluche, in his _Spectacle de la Nature_, 1732,\r\nalso says: 'If the wine be drawn off towards the end of March, when\r\nthe sap begins to rise in the vine, it will froth to such a degree as\r\nto whiten like milk, to the very bottom of the glass, the moment it is\r\npoured out. Wine will sometimes acquire this quality if it be drawn off\r\nduring the ascent of the sap in August, which makes it evident that\r\nthe froth is occasioned by the operation of the air and sap, which\r\nthen act with vigour in the wood of the vine, and likewise in the\r\nliquor it produced. This violent ebulition, which is so agreeable to\r\nsome persons, is thought by connoisseurs to be inconsistent with the\r\ngoodness of the wine, since the greenest may be made to whiten into a\r\nfroth, and the most perfect wines seldom discover this quality.' In\r\nan article in the _Journal de Verdun_ of November 1726, the following\r\npassage occurs: 'A wine merchant of Anjou having written some time back\r\nto a celebrated magistrate in Champagne, Bertin du Rocheret, begging\r\nhim to forward the secret of making _vin mousseux_ during the vintage,\r\nthe magistrate answered, \"That _vin mousseux_ was not made during the\r\nvintage; that there was no special soil for it; that the Anjou wines\r\nwere suitable, since poor wine froths as well as the most excellent,\r\nfrothing being a property of thin poor wine. That to make wine froth,\r\nit was necessary to draw it off as clear as could be done from the\r\nlees, if it had not been already racked; to bottle it on a fine clear\r\nday in January or February, or in March at the latest; three or four\r\nmonths afterwards the wine will be found effervescent, especially if\r\nit has some tartness and a little strength. When the wine works (like\r\nthe vine) your wine will effervesce more than usual; a taste of vintage\r\nand of fermentation will be found in it.\" The excellent wines of Ay and\r\nour good Champagne wines do not froth, or very slightly; they content\r\nthemselves with sparkling in the glass.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 114: St. Simon's _Mémoires_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 115: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 116: _Mémoire_ of 1718.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 117: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 118: Antony Réal's _Ce qu'il y a dans une Bouteille de Vin_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 119: Legrand d'Aussy's _Vie Privée des Français_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 120:\r\n\r\n    'Là le nombre et l'éclat de cent verres bien nets\r\n    Répare par les yeux la disette des mets;\r\n        Et la mousse petillante\r\n        D'un vin délicat et frais\r\n        D'une fortune brillante\r\n    Cache à mon souvenir les fragiles attraits.'\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 121:\r\n\r\n    'Quant à la muse de St. Maur\r\n    Que moins de douceur accompagne.\r\n    Il lui faut du vin de Champagne\r\n    Pour lui faire prendre l'essor.'\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 122:\r\n\r\n    'Alors, grand' merveille, sera\r\n        De voir flûter vin de Champagne.'\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 123:\r\n\r\n    'Sur ce rivage emaillé,\r\n        Où Neuillé borde la Seine,\r\n    Reviens au vin d'Hautvillé\r\n        Mêler les eaux d'Hypocrène.'\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 124:\r\n\r\n    'Phébus adonc va se désabuser\r\n        De son amour pour la docte fontaine,\r\n    Et connoîtra que pour bon vers puiser\r\n        Vin champenois vaut mieux qu'eau d'Hippocrène.'\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 125: The father, Adam Bertin du Rocheret, was born in 1662,\r\nand died in 1736; his son, Philippe Valentin, the _lieutenant criminel_\r\nat Epernay, was born in 1693, and died in 1762. Both owned vineyards\r\nat Epernay, Ay, and Pierry, and were engaged in the wine-trade, and\r\nboth left a voluminous mass of correspondence, &c., extracts from which\r\nhave been given by M. Louis Perrier in his _Mémoire sur le Vin de\r\nChampagne_. The Marshal was an old customer. At the foot of a letter\r\nof his of the 20th December 1705, asking for 'two quartaux of the most\r\nexcellent vin de Champagne, and a pièce of good for ordinary drinking,'\r\nBertin has written, 'I will send you, as soon as the river, which is\r\nstrongly flooded, becomes navigable, the wine you ask for, and you\r\nwill be pleased with it; but as the best new wine is not of a quality\r\nto be drunk in all its goodness by the spring, I should think that\r\nfifty flasks of old wine, the most exquisite in the kingdom that I can\r\nfurnish you with, together with fifty other good ones, will suit you\r\ninstead of one of the two caques.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 126: _Tocane_ was a light wine obtained, like the best Tokay,\r\nfrom the juice allowed to drain from grapes slightly trodden, but not\r\npressed.

Though at\r\none time very popular, and largely produced in Champagne, it is now no\r\nlonger made. The wine of Ay enjoyed a high reputation as _tocane_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 127: Louis Perrier's _Mémoire sur le Vin de Champagne_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 128: Letter of Dom Grossart.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 129: Louis Perrier's _Mémoire sur le Vin de Champagne_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 130: Ample details of the systems of viticulture and\r\nwine-making pursued in the Champagne at the commencement of the\r\neighteenth century are to be found in the anonymous _Mémoire_ published\r\nin 1718. These are reproduced to a great extent in the _Spectacle de\r\nla Nature_ of Noel Antoine Pluche, a native of Reims, who composed\r\nthis work (published in 1732) for the benefit of the son of Lord\r\nStafford, to whom he was tutor. The Abbé Pluche, after being professor\r\nof humanity and rhetoric at the University of Reims, was about to\r\nenter into holy orders, but being denounced as an opponent of the Bull\r\nUnigenitus, abandoned all ideas of preferment, and devoted himself to\r\nprivate tuition and the composition of his great work, the _Spectacle\r\nde la Nature_. This last is a perfect encyclopædia, in the form of a\r\nseries of dialogues, recalling those in Mrs. Barbauld's _Evenings at\r\nHome_, the interlocutors being the Count, the Countess, the Chevalier,\r\nand the Prior; and the style may be best judged from the following\r\nextracts from the contemporary translation of Mr. Samuel Humphries.\r\n\r\nIn Dialogue XIII. on 'Vines,' the Count remarks that, after studying\r\nthe methods of viticulture followed in different provinces, he 'could\r\nnot discover any to be ranked in Competition with those Precautions\r\nthat have been taken by the Inhabitants of Champaign' in the production\r\nof their wine. By 'a long Course of Experience' they had 'acquired the\r\nproper Method of tinging it with the Complexion of a Cherry, or the Eye\r\nof a Partridge. They could likewise brighten it into the whitest Hue,\r\nor deepen it into a perfect Red.'\r\n\r\nIn the succeeding Dialogue on 'Wines,' the Count states that 'Vines\r\nvary in their Qualities. Some are planted in a very light and strong\r\nSoil, and they yield a bright and fragrant Wine; others are placed in\r\na more nourishing Tract of Land, and they produce a Wine of a greater\r\nBody. The reasonable Combination of these different Fruits will produce\r\nan exquisite Liquor, that will have all the Advantages of a sufficient\r\nBody, a Delicacy of Flavour, a Fragrancy of Scent, and a Liveliness\r\nof Colour, and which may be Kept for several Years without the least\r\nAlteration. It was the Knowledge of those Effects that result from\r\nintermixing the Grapes of three or four Vines of different Qualities,\r\nwhich improved the celebrated Wines of Sillery, Ai, and Hautvillers to\r\nthe Perfection they have now acquired. Father Parignon, a Benedictine\r\nof Hautvillers on the Marne, was the first who made any successful\r\nAttempt to intermix the Grapes of the different Vines in this manner,\r\nand the Wine of Perignon d'Hautvillers bore the greatest Estimation\r\namongst us till the Practise of this Method became more extensive.'\r\n\r\nThe Count notes that white wines from white grapes being deficient\r\nin strength, and apt to grow yellow and degenerate before the next\r\nreturn of summer, had gone out of repute, except for some medicinal\r\nprescriptions, whilst 'the grey Wine, which has so bright an Eye and\r\nresembles the Complexion of Crystal, is produced by the blackest\r\nGrapes.' 'The Wine of a black Grape may be tinged with any Colour we\r\nthink proper; those who desire to have it perfectly White have recourse\r\nto the following Method. The People employed in the Vintage begin their\r\nLabours at an early Hour in the Morning; and when they have selected\r\nthe finest Grapes, they lay them gently in their Baskets, in order to\r\nbe carried out of the Vineyard; or they place them in large Panniers,\r\nwithout pressing them in the least or wiping off the dewy Moisture\r\nor the azure Dye that covers them. Dews and exhaling Mists greatly\r\ncontribute to the Whiteness of the Wine. 'Tis customary to cover the\r\nBaskets with wet Cloths in a hot Sunshine, because the Liquor will be\r\napt to assume a red Tincture if the Grapes should happen to be heated.\r\nThese Baskets are then placed on the Backs of such Animals as are of\r\na gentle Nature, and carry their Burdens with an easy Motion to the\r\nCellar, where the Grapes continue covered in a cool Air. When the\r\nWarmth of the Sun proves moderate, the Labours of the Vintage are not\r\ndiscontinued till Eleven in the Morning; but a glowing Heat makes it\r\nnecessary for them to cease at Nine.'\r\n\r\nYet even these precautions were liable to fail, since 'the Heat of\r\nthe Sun and the Shocks of the Carriages are sometimes so violent, and\r\nproduce such strong Effects upon the exterior Coat of the Grapes,\r\nthat the Fluids contained in that Coat, and which are then in Motion,\r\nmix themselves with the Juice of the Pulp at the first Pressing; in\r\nconsequence of which, the Extraction of a Wine perfectly white is\r\nrendered impracticable, and its Colour will resemble the Eye of a\r\nPartridge, or perhaps some deeper Hue. The Quality of the Wine is still\r\nthe same; but it must be either entirely White or Red, in order to\r\nprove agreeable to the Taste and Mode which now prevail.'\r\n\r\nThe Count describes the two pressings and five cuttings, the latter\r\nterm derived from the squaring of the mass of grapes with the cutting\r\npeel, and the system of 'glewing' this wine, 'the weight of an\r\n_ecu d'or_' of 'Fish Glew, which the Dutch import amongst us from\r\nArchangel,' being added to each _pièce_, with the addition sometimes\r\nof a pint of spirits of wine or brandy. He then explains the method\r\npractised of drawing off the wine without disturbing the barrels, by\r\nthe aid of a tube and a gigantic pair of bellows. The vessels were\r\nconnected by the former, and the wine then driven from one to the\r\nother by the pressure of air pumped in by means of the latter. A\r\nsulphur-match was burnt in the empty vessels, so that it might 'receive\r\na Steam of Spirits capable of promoting the natural Fire and bright\r\nComplexion of the Liquor.'\r\n\r\nNoting that the wines should be again 'glewed' eight days before they\r\nare bottled, Pluche says: 'The Month of March is the usual Season\r\nfor glewing the most tender Wines, such as those of Ai, Epernai,\r\nHautvilliers, and Pieri, whose chief Consumption is in France; but\r\nthis Operation should not be performed on such strong Wines as those\r\nof Sillery, Verzenai, and other Mountain Wines of Reims, till they\r\nare twelve Months old, at which Time they are capable of supporting\r\nthemselves for several Years. When these Wines are bottled off before\r\nthey have exhaled their impetuous Particles, they burst a Number of\r\nBottles, and are less perfect in their Qualities. The proper Method\r\nof bottling Wine consists in leaving the Space of a Finger's Breadth\r\nbetween the Cork and the Liquor, and in binding the Cork down with\r\nPackthread; it will also be proper to seal the Mouths of the Bottles\r\nwith Wax, to prevent Mistakes and Impositions. The Bottles should\r\nlikewise be reclined on one Side, because if they are placed in an\r\nupright Position, the Corks will grow dry in a few Months for want of\r\nMoisture, and shrink from their first Dimensions. In Consequence of\r\nwhich a Passage will be opened to the external Air, which will then\r\nimpart an Acidity to the Wine, and form a white Flower on the Surface,\r\nwhich will be an Evidence of its Corruption.'\r\n\r\nThe _Mémoire_ of 1718 also points out the necessity of leaving a space\r\nbetween the cork and the wine, saying that without this, when the wine\r\nbegan to work at the different seasons of the year, it would break a\r\nlarge number of bottles; and that even despite this precaution large\r\nnumbers are broken, especially when the wine is a little green. The\r\nordinary bottles for Champagne, styled _flacons_, or flasks, held 'a\r\n_pinte de Paris_, less half a glass,' and cost from 12 to 15 francs the\r\nhundred; and as wood abounded in the province, several glass-works were\r\nestablished there for their manufacture. As the bottling of the wine,\r\nespecially in the early years, was mostly to order, many customers had\r\ntheir flasks stamped with their arms, at a cost of about 30 per cent\r\nmore. The corks--'solid, even, and not worm-eaten'--cost from 50 to 60\r\nsols per hundred. Wire was as yet quite unknown. The cost of bottling a\r\npoinçon of wine in 1712 was: for 200 bottles, 30 livres; 200 corks, 3\r\nlivres; 2 baskets and packing, 8 livres; bottling, string, and sealing,\r\n3 livres; total, 44 livres, or say 36 shillings.\r\n\r\nIt would appear from the _Mémoire_ that the pernicious practice of\r\nicing still Champagne, already noticed, continued in vogue as regards\r\nsparkling wine. The wine was recommended to be taken out of the cellar\r\nhalf an hour before it was intended it should be drunk, and put into\r\na bucket of water with two or three pounds of ice. The bottle had to\r\nbe previously uncorked, and the cork lightly replaced, otherwise it\r\nwas believed there was danger of the bottle breaking. A short half an\r\nhour in the ice was said to bring out the goodness of the wine. Bertin\r\ndu Rocheret counselled the use of ice to develop the real merits of a\r\nvinous wine of Ay.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 131: Max Sutaine's _Essai sur le Vin de Champagne_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 132: _Mémoires_ of 1718 and 1722.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 133: Ibid.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 134: Max Sutaine's _Essai sur le Vin de Champagne_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 135: _Mémoire_ of 1718. The perils to which it was exposed\r\nduring this transit are pointed at in a letter to the elder Bertin\r\nfrom a customer in Paris in 1689: 'I thought it better to wait before\r\ngiving you any news of the wine you sent me until it was fit to drink.\r\nI tapped it yesterday, and found it poor. I can hardly believe but that\r\nthe boatmen did not fall-to upon it whenever they had need, and took\r\ngreat care to fill it up again, for it could not have been fuller than\r\nthey delivered it.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 136: Pluche's _Spectacle de la Nature_, 1732.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 137: _Mémoire_ of 1718.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 138: Louis Perrier's _Mémoire sur le Vin de Champagne_.

As to the first-named complaint,\r\nBertin du Rocheret disposes of it by noting, in a list compiled by him\r\nof all the deaths of any moment at Epernay, from 1644 downwards, the\r\ndecease, at the age of seventy-five, on January 1, 1733, of Jeanne\r\nMaillard, 'the only person in the district ever attacked by the gout.'\r\nHis brother-in-law, Dr. Jacques de Reims, in a letter to Helvetius\r\nin 1730, asserts that this complaint is only known by name in the\r\nChampagne; and that, as regards the stone, not more than ten people\r\nwere affected therewith within a radius of ten leagues. He maintained\r\nthat the _non-mousseux_ white wine of the Champagne, drunk at maturity\r\nand tempered with water, was the best of all beverages for preserving\r\ngeneral health; and the eminent Dr. Camille Falconnet held the same\r\nopinion. Arthur Young, moreover, furnishes spontaneous testimony with\r\nregard to rheumatism. Extolling the sparkling wine of Reims in 1787,\r\nhe says, 'I suppose fixed air is good for the rheumatism; I had some\r\nwrithes of it before I entered Champagne, but the _vin mousseux_ has\r\nabsolutely banished it;' and on reaching Ove, he regrets that 'the _vin\r\nde Champagne_, which is forty sous at Reims, is three livres here, and\r\nexecrably bad; so there is an end of my physic for the rheumatism'\r\n(_Travels in France in 1787-9_).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 146: _An vinum Remense Burgundico suavius et salubrius._]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 147: In his ode entitled _Vinum Burgundum_, the passage\r\naspersing the wines of Reims runs as follows:\r\n\r\n      'Nam suum Rhemi licet usque Bacchum\r\n    Jactitent: æstu petulans jocoso\r\n    Hic quidam fervet cyathis, et aura\r\n      Limpidus acri.\r\n\r\n        Vellicat nares avidas; venenum\r\n    At latet: multos facies fefellit,\r\n    Hic tamen spargat modico secundam\r\n        Munere mensam.'\r\n\r\nThe French version, by M. de Bellechaume, entitled an 'Ode au Vin\r\nde Bourgogne,' and published in his _Recueil des Poésies latines et\r\nfrançaises sur les Vins de Champagne et de Bourgogne_, Paris 1712, is\r\nas follows:\r\n\r\n    'Vante, Champagne ambitieuse,\r\n        L'odeur et l'éclat de ton vin,\r\n    Dont la sève pernicieuse\r\n        Dans ce brillant cache un venin,\r\n    Tu dois toute ta gloire en France,\r\n    A cette agréable apparence,\r\n    Qui nous attire et nous séduit;\r\n        Qu'à Beaune ta liqueur soumise\r\n        Dans les repas ne soit admise,\r\n    Que sagement avec le fruit.'\r\n\r\nM. de la Monnoye, himself a Burgundian, has rendered this passage\r\nsomewhat differently in an edition published the same year at Dijon:\r\n\r\n    'Jusqu'aux cieux le Champagne élève\r\n        De son vin pétillant la riante liqueur,\r\n        On sait qu'il brille aux yeux, qu'il chatouille le c[oe]ur,\r\n    Qu'il pique l'odorat d'une agréable sève.\r\n\r\n    Mais craignons un poison couvert,\r\n        L'aspic est sous les fleurs, que seulement par grâce;\r\n        Quand Beaune aura primé, Reims occupant la place,\r\n    Vienne légèrement amuser le dessert.'\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 148: _Campania vindicata; sive laus vini Remensis a poeta\r\nBurgundo eleganter quidam, sed immerito culpati._ Offerebat civitati\r\nRemensi Carolus Coffin.

I always thought Burgundy had some similitude with\r\na solid understanding, which affects us with lasting impressions, and\r\nthat Champaign resembles a lively wit, which glitters more upon the\r\nimagination, but which is not always serviceable to its possessor.\r\n\r\n_Count_: If you had made the froth of some Champaign wines and the\r\nsallies of a sprightly wit your parallel, I should have thought it\r\nunexceptionable; and several pleasant remarks might be made on this\r\nsprightliness without solidity. But such a Champaign wine as that of\r\nSillery unites all the vigour of Burgundy, with an agreeable flavour\r\npeculiar to itself.\r\n\r\n_Prior_: I prefer useful qualities to those that are merely agreeable.\r\nBurgundy seems to be a more salutary wine than Champaign, and will\r\nalways be triumphant for that reason. Its colour alone declares it to\r\nbe a wine of a good body, and I must confess I am apt to be diffident\r\nof all dazzling appearances.\r\n\r\n_Count_: People believe that this deep colour, so esteemed in Burgundy\r\nwines, is an indication of their wholesomeness; but it is observable\r\nin the grossest wines, and results from an intermixture of the husky\r\nparts of the grape. Wine, in proportion to the quantity of these\r\nparticles blended with it, will be less qualified for digestion.\r\nThe gout, therefore, and the stone, with which the inhabitants of\r\nwine-countries are so frequently afflicted, are distempers hardly\r\nknown either at Reims or on the banks of the Marne, where the wines\r\nare very moderately coloured.... Wines may be made almost as white in\r\nBurgundy as they are in Champaign, though not so good; and, on the\r\nother hand, the Champenois press a wine as red as the Burgundy growth,\r\nand the merchants sell it either as the best species of Burgundy to\r\nthe wine-conners, who are the first people that are deceived in it, or\r\nas red Champaign to the connoisseurs, who prefer it to any other wine.\r\nIf we may judge of the merit of wines by the price, we shall certainly\r\nassign the preference to Champaign, since the finest species of this\r\nwine is sold in the vaults of Sillery and Epernai for six, seven, or\r\neight hundred livres, when the same quality of the best Burgundy may be\r\npurchased for three hundred.\r\n\r\n_Countess_: Let me entreat you, gentlemen, to leave this controversy\r\nundecided. The equal pretensions that are formed by these two great\r\nprovinces promote an emulation which is advantageous to us. The\r\npartisans for Burgundy and Champaign form two factions in the State;\r\nbut their contests are very entertaining, and their encounters not\r\nat all dangerous. It is very usual to see the zealots of one party\r\nmaintaining a correspondence with those of the other; they frequently\r\nassociate together without any reserve, and those who were advocates\r\nfor Burgundy at the beginning of the entertainment are generally\r\nreconciled to Champaign before the appearance of the dessert.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 168: _Letters, &c._ Hamburg and Paris, 1788.

The decree\r\nin question begins by setting forth that, by the _Ordonnance des\r\naides de Normandie_, wine was forbidden to be brought into Rouen or\r\nits suburbs in bottles, jugs, or any less vessels than hogsheads and\r\nbarrels--with the exception of _vin de liqueur_ packed in boxes--under\r\npain of confiscation and one hundred livres' fine, and that carriers\r\nwere prohibited from conveying wine in bottles in the province without\r\nleave from the _fermier des aides_. Nevertheless, petitions had been\r\npresented by the _maire_ and _échevins_ of Reims, stating 'that the\r\ntrade in the gray wines of Champagne had considerably increased\r\nfor some years past, through the precautions taken at the place of\r\nproduction to bottle them during the first moon of the month of March\r\nfollowing the vintage, in order to render them _mousseux_; that those\r\nwho make use of the gray wine of Champagne prefer that which is\r\n_mousseux_ to that which is not; and that this gray wine cannot be\r\ntransported in casks into the interior of the kingdom or to foreign\r\ncountries without totally losing its qualities,'--a statement probably\r\nintentionally overdrawn, since Bertin du Rocheret used to export it in\r\ncasks to England. Yet the _fermiers des aides de Normandie_ claimed\r\nto prohibit the transport of wines in bottle; and if their pretension\r\nheld good, the trade in the gray wine of Champagne would be destroyed.\r\n'Shifting the cause, as a lawyer knows how,' the decree recapitulates\r\nthe plea of the _fermiers_ that the transport of wine in bottles\r\noffered facilities for defrauding the revenue, since a carrier with\r\na load could easily leave some of it _en route_ with innkeepers, and\r\nthese in turn could hide bottles holding a _pinte de Paris_ from the\r\nofficers in chests, cupboards, &c., and sell them subsequently, to the\r\ndetriment of the _droits de détail_.\r\n\r\nThe foregoing duly rehearsed, there follows the decree permitting 'to\r\nbe sent in bottles into the province of Normandy, for the consumption\r\nof the said province, gray wine of Champagne in baskets, which must not\r\nhold less than one hundred bottles,' but prohibiting the introduction\r\nin bottles of any other growth or quality, under the penalty of\r\nconfiscation and one hundred livres' fine. Permission is also given\r\nto pass gray and red wine of Champagne, or of any other _cru_ or\r\nquality, in baskets of fifty or one hundred bottles for conveyance\r\ninto other provinces, or for shipment to foreign parts by the ports of\r\nRouen, Caen, Dieppe, and Havre. The wagoners, however, in all cases\r\nare to have certificates signed and countersigned by all manner of\r\nauthorities, and are only to enter the province by certain specified\r\nroutes. All wine, too, is to pay the _droit de détail_, except in the\r\ncase of people not continuously residing in the province, who may\r\nbe going to their estates, or those bound for the eaux de Forges, a\r\ncelebrated watering-place, both of whom may take a certain quantity in\r\nbottle with them for their own consumption free of duty.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 172: 'To be drunk as _nouveau_ or bottled,' says M.

Yet here is a _tirage_ of 6000\r\nbottles taking place thirty-four years previously. The extent of the\r\nbottled-wine trade is confirmed by Arthur Young, who in 1787 visited\r\nAy, where M. Lasnier had 60,000 bottles in his cellar, and M. Dorsé\r\nfrom 30,000 to 40,000. Marmontel in 1716 mentions Henin de Navarre's\r\ncellars at Avenay as containing 50,000 bottles of Champagne.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 196: E. J.

Maumené mentions a _casse_\r\nin a Reims cellar which had reached 98 per cent at his visit, and was\r\nstill continuing.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 198: Max Sutaine's _Essai sur le Vin de Champagne_. The Abbé\r\nBignon confirms this in a letter of December 20, 1736, to Bertin du\r\nRocheret, respecting wine received from him. 'The wine sealed with\r\na cipher in red wax,' he observes, 'seemed to me very delicate, but\r\nhaving as yet some _liqueur_ which time may get rid of, though after\r\nthat I am afraid there will not remain much strength. Another, also\r\nsealed with red wax, but with a coat-of-arms, seems to have more\r\nquality and vinosity, though also very delicate and very light, both\r\n_sablant_ perfectly, though they cannot be called _mousseux_. As to\r\nthat which is sealed with black, the people who esteem foam would\r\nbestow the most magnificent eulogies upon it. It would be difficult\r\nto find any that carries this beautiful perfection further. Three\r\nspoonfuls at the bottom of the glass is surmounted with the strongest\r\nfoam to the very brim; on the other hand, I found in it a furious\r\n_vert_, and not much vinosity.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 199: In 1734 he speaks of his _mousseux sablant_, and\r\nforwards to the Marquis de Polignac both _mousseux_ and _petillant_. In\r\n1736 he offers M. Véron de Bussy his choice of _demi-mousseux_, _bon\r\nmousseux_, and _saute bouchon_; and the following year distinguishes\r\nhis Ay _mousseux_ from his _saute bouchon_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 200: Respecting the price of sparkling Champagne during\r\nthe first half of the eighteenth century, a few instances from the\r\ncorrespondence of Bertin du Rocheret may here he quoted. In 1716 he\r\noffers Marshal d'Artagnan 1500 bottles at 35 sols, cash down, and taken\r\nat Epernay. In 1725 he offers _flacons blancs mousseux liqueur_ at from\r\n30 to 50 sols, and _ambrés non mousseux, sablant_, at 25 sols. Ten\r\nyears later _saute bouchon_ is quoted by him at 40 and 45 sols, and\r\nin 1736 at 3 livres, _demi-mousseux_ ranging from 36 to 40 sols, and\r\n_bon mousseux_ from 45 to 50 sols. The following year _saute bouchon_\r\nfetched 3 livres 6 sols, and _mousseux_ 42 sols. In 1736 he insisted\r\nupon his _flacons_ holding a _pinte_; and a royal decree of March\r\n8, 1755, which regulated the weight and capacity of sparkling-wine\r\nbottles, required these to weigh 25 ounces, and to hold a _pinte de\r\nParis_, or about 1.64 imperial pint. They were, moreover, to be tied\r\ncrosswise on the top of the cork, with a string of three strands well\r\ntwisted. Their cost was 15 livres per hundred in 1734 and 1738, and\r\nfrom 17 to 19 livres in 1754.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 201: Louis Perrier's _Mémoire sur le Vin de Champagne_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 202: It would appear from Bidet that the wines of the\r\nMountain had not been transformed into _vin mousseux_ as late as 1752,\r\nas, in his book on wine published during that year, he only includes in\r\nthe list of places producing sparkling wine Ay, Avenay, Mareuil, Dizy,\r\nHautvillers, Epernay, Pierry, Cramant, Avize, and Le Mesnil.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 203:\r\n\r\n    'Votre palais, usé, perclus\r\n        Par liqueur inflammable,\r\n    Préfère de mousseux verjus\r\n        Au nectar véritable.'\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 204: Louis Perrier's _Mémoire sur le Vin de Champagne_. In\r\nthe thesis in favour of Champagne, written by Dr. Xavier of Reims\r\nin 1777, the acidulous character of the wine is confirmed by the\r\nauthor, who naïvely remarks that it is as efficacious in preventing\r\nputrefaction as are other acids.

The guild of gingerbread-makers at Reims was\r\nestablished in the sixteenth century, and from that time forward was\r\nengaged in continual squabbles with the bakers and pastrycooks of the\r\ncity, who could not be brought to understand that they had not the\r\nright to make gingerbread. Countless reams of paper were scribbled\r\nover by the lawyers of the two contending interests; but though the\r\nBailli of Reims on several occasions pronounced a formal verdict, to\r\nthe effect that no one but a sworn and accepted gingerbread-maker\r\nshould have act or part in the making of the indigestible delicacy, the\r\ncontumacious bakers continued to treat his edicts as naught. Eventually\r\na royal edict of 1776, which suppressed the privileges of the majority\r\nof the guilds in France, deprived the Reims gingerbread-makers for ever\r\nof the right of figuring with swords by their sides and three-cornered\r\nhats on their heads at all local ceremonies, civil or religious, and\r\nthrew their trade open to all.\r\n\r\nIt was at the close of Louis XIV.'s reign that the _pain d'épice_\r\nof Reims reached the summit of its renown. At the coronation of his\r\nsuccessor, the _échevins_ of Reims presented the monarch with several\r\nbaskets of it; and when Maria Leczinska passed through Reims in\r\nJanuary 1725, the notables offered her twelve wicker baskets, covered\r\nwith damask and ornamented with ribbons, containing fresh and dried\r\npears, conserves, preserved lemons, almond-cakes, and a new kind of\r\ngingerbread, which received the name of _nonnette à la Reine_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 216: This escutcheon shows the arms of Reims, which at\r\nfirst consisted of _rinçeaux_ or branches; subsequently a cross and a\r\ncrozier, placed saltire-wise, and a sainte Ampoule, were added. When\r\nthe government of the city passed from the archbishop, the entwined\r\nolive-branches and chief strewn with fleurs de lis were adopted, the\r\nold motto, 'Dieu en soit garde,' being retained. The iron gates of the\r\nPorte de Paris were removed to their present position in 1843, to allow\r\nof the passage of the canal.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 217: From the days of Charles VIII. to those of Louis XIV.,\r\nit was customary on these occasions for the keys to be presented by a\r\nyoung girl styled the Pucelle de Reims; and J. M. C. Leber, in his work\r\n_Des Cérémonies du Sacre_, is of opinion that this custom arose in some\r\nway from the visit of Joan of Arc.

'Formerly,' remarks Pluche, 'it was\r\nvery difficult to preserve the wine of Ay longer than one year. When\r\nthe juice of the white grapes, whose quantity was very great in that\r\nvineyard, began to assume a yellowish hue, it became predominant, and\r\ncreated a change in all the wine; but ever since the white grapes have\r\nbeen disused, the Marne wines may be easily kept for the space of four\r\nor five years' (_Spectacle de la Nature_, 1732).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 381: From time immemorial the vineyards of Ay and Dizy paid\r\ntithes to the Abbey of Hautvillers, the former a sixtieth and the\r\nlatter an eleventh of their produce. These dues were, by a decree of\r\n1670, levied at the gate of Ay. In 1772, Tirant de Flavigny, a large\r\nwine-grower, who farmed, amongst other vineyards, 'Les Quartiers' at\r\nHautvillers, insisted on leaving the tithe of grapes at the foot of the\r\nvine for collection by the abbey tithe-collectors. The Abbot Alexandre\r\nAnge de Talleyrand Périgord refused to accept them, and insisted in\r\nturn that the whole of the grapes should either be brought to the gate\r\nof Hautvillers or converted into wine in the vineyard, and the eleventh\r\npart of this wine handed to his representative. From a _procès verbal_\r\ndrawn up by the Mayor of Ay, it seems that the inhabitants were willing\r\nto pay a monetary commutation, as was the prevailing custom, or to\r\nleave the abbot's share of grapes in the vineyards; but objected to the\r\ntithe being taken, usually with considerable delay, on each basket,\r\nwhereby the remaining grapes were bruised, and the possibility of\r\nbright white wine being made from them rendered exceedingly doubtful.\r\nIt was not till 1787 that it was finally settled that the tithes should\r\nbe paid in money at the rate of so much per arpent, and it is plain\r\nthat the abbot's chief object was to throw as much difficulty as he\r\ncould in the way of rival makers of fine wines.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 382: This curse is alluded to in the following verse from a\r\nsixteenth-century ballad written against the men of Ay:\r\n\r\n    'Tu n'auras ni chien ni chat\r\n    Pour te chanter _Libera_,\r\n    Et tu mourras mau-chrétien,\r\n    Toi qu'a maudit Saint Trézain.'\r\n\r\nThe fountain of St. Tresain, which enjoys the reputation of curing\r\ndiseases, and in the water of which it is pretended stolen food cannot\r\nbe cooked, still exists at Mareuil.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 383: The yield from the Ay vineyards averages five pièces,\r\nor 220 gallons per acre. Arthur Young, writing in 1787, estimated\r\nthat the arpent (rather more than the acre) produced from two to six\r\npièces of wine, or an average of four pièces, two of which sold for\r\n200 livres, one for 150 livres, and one for 50 livres. He valued the\r\narpent of vines at from 3000 to 6000 livres. Henderson, in his _History\r\nof Ancient and Modern Wines_, says that in 1822 there were a thousand\r\narpents on the hill immediately behind the village of Ay valued at\r\nfrom 10,000 to 12,000 francs the arpent, and that one plot had shortly\r\nbefore fetched 15,000 francs per arpent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 384: In 1873, two years later, the price mounted as high\r\nas 1000 francs; while in 1880, owing to the yield being far below an\r\naverage one and the quality promising to be exceedingly good, the wine\r\nwas bought up before the grapes were pressed at prices ranging from\r\n1100 to 1400 francs the pièce.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 385: In one of these, dated 1243, mention is made of the\r\n'vinea parva' belonging to the Abbey of Avenay, and of the 'vineam\r\nWarneri in loco qui dicetur Monswarins,' perhaps the existing clos\r\nWarigny. In another of Philip the Fair, dated 1300, and confirming\r\nthe abbey in the possession of property purchased from Jeanne de\r\nSapigneul, we read of 'unam vineam dictam la grant vigne domine\r\nAelidis sitam en Perrelles' and 'unam vineam dictam a la Perriere.' In\r\ncharters of the fourteenth century vineyards are mentioned at Avenay\r\nand Mutigny, under the titles of Les Perches, Haut-Bonnet, Praëlles,\r\nLes Foissets, Fond de Bonnet, Berard, Chassant, &c. One sold to the\r\nabbey in 1334 by Guillaume de Valenciennes was at a spot then, as now,\r\nstyled Plantelles. In 1336 the justices at Château-Thierry confirmed\r\nthe Abbess, Madame Clémence, in the 'droit de ban vin'--that is, the\r\nright of selling her wine before any one else in the territory of\r\nAvenay. This was again confirmed in 1344 by the Bailly of Sézanne, who\r\nheld that she alone had the right of selling during the month after\r\nChristmas, the month after Easter, and the month after Pentecost.\r\nAmongst other records is one noting the condemnation of Perresson\r\nLegris, clerk, of Avenay, who was sentenced in 1460 by the Bailly of\r\nEpernay to a fine of 60 sols, for selling his wine during the month\r\nafter Christmas without permission of the Dames d'Avenay. The charters\r\nof the fifteenth century also abound in references to vineyards, or\r\n'droits de vinage,' appertaining to the abbey at Les Coutures, Champ\r\nBernard, Auches, Bois de Brousse, Thonnay, &c., in the territory of\r\nAvenay, and Les Charmières, Torchamp, Saussaye, &c., at Mutigny.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 386: In 1668, an epoch at which the wines of Avenay had\r\nacquired a high reputation, the abbey owned 43 arpents of vineland at\r\nAvenay, Mutigny, and Mareuil, yielding the preceding year 200 poinçons\r\nof wine, the sale of which produced 6000 livres. It also had 13\r\npressoirs banaux, which were farmed for 50 poinçons of wine, and tithes\r\nof wine at Mareuil amounting to 14 poinçons and 460 livres in money,\r\nand at Ambonnay amounting to 3 poinçons, the total of 67 poinçons\r\nfetching 1206 livres. The valet who looked after the vines had 50\r\nlivres per annum, and the cooper who looked after the wines, 40 livres.\r\nThe total cost of stakes, manure, culture, pruning, wine-making, and\r\ncasks was 2700 livres per annum. Ten pièces of wine 'of the best of the\r\nabbey, and worth 300 livres,' were annually given away in caques and\r\nbottles to 'persons of quality and friends of the house, and travellers\r\nof condition who pass;' whilst 120 poinçons, valued at 3000 livres,\r\nwere consumed at the abbey itself. The abbey was partially destroyed by\r\nfire in 1754; and its destruction was completed during the Revolution,\r\nat which epoch its vineyards yielded a net revenue of 2500 livres.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 387: In addition to Madame de la Marck, who was connected,\r\nby the marriage of one of her brothers to a princess of the house of\r\nBourbon, with Henri Quatre, and to whose influence with that monarch\r\nthe execution of the 'Traité des Vendanges' was mainly due, the roll\r\nof the Abbesses of Avenay comprises several illustrious personages,\r\namongst them St. Bertha; Bertha II., daughter of the Emperor Lothaire;\r\nthe ex-Empress Teutberga; Bénédicte de Gonzague, daughter of the Duke\r\nde Nevers, and sister of the Princess Palatine, who took such an active\r\npart during the troubles of the Fronde; and ladies of the illustrious\r\nfamilies of Saulx Tavannes, Craon, Levis, Beauvillers, Brulart de\r\nSillery, Boufflers, &c. M. Louis Paris, in his _Histoire de l'Abbaye\r\nd'Avenay_, gives some curious instances of the exercise of the 'haut\r\net basse justice' possessed by these ladies. In 1587, under the rule\r\nof Madame de la Marck, we find the Bailly of Avenay, acting as 'first\r\nmagistrate of Madame l'Abbesse,' sentencing one man and four women\r\n'to be hung, strangled, and burnt, and the goods belonging to them\r\nconfiscated to the profit of the Lady Justiciary,' for the crime of\r\nsorcery. In 1645 we find a 'sentence of the Bailly of Avenay against\r\nSimeon Delacoste, accused and convicted of the crime of homicide\r\ncommitted upon the person of Jean Bernier, and for this condemned to\r\nbe hung and strangled by the executioner on a gallows erected in the\r\npublic market-place, with confiscation of 300 livres, to be levied on\r\nhis goods, to the profit of the Lady Justiciary.' When the criminal\r\ncould not be caught, as was the case with Nicholas Thimot, vine-grower\r\nat Avenay in 1555, the sentence ran that he should 'be hung in effigy,\r\nand his goods confiscated to the profit of Madame.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 388: The following lines, quoted by M. Philibert Milsand in\r\nhis _Procès poétique touchant les Vins de Bourgogne et de Champagne_,\r\nmay be taken as referring either to the wine or the scenery:\r\n\r\n    'Si quis in hoc mundo vult vivere corde jocoso,\r\n    Vadat Cumerias sumere delicias.'\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 389: In Arthur Young's time (1787-9) an arpent of vineyard at\r\nHautvillers, valued at 4000 livres, yielded from two to four pièces, or\r\nhogsheads, of wine, which sold from 700 to 900 livres the queue (two\r\npièces). This is more than the wine would ordinarily realise to-day,\r\nalthough in years of scarcity it has fetched 700 francs the pièce, and\r\nin 1880 as much as 1000 francs.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 390: Cazotte, ex-Commissary-General of the Navy and author of\r\nthe _Diable Amoureux_, who was guillotined as a Royalist in 1792, had\r\na magnificently fitted mansion at Pierry. He distinguished himself by\r\nhis opposition to the pretensions of the Abbey of Hautvillers, which\r\nin 1775 claimed the right of taking tithes at Pierry not only in the\r\nvineyards, but on the wine in the cellars. Cazotte argued that unless\r\nthe monks chose to take their due proportion of grapes left for them\r\nat the foot of each vine, all they were entitled to was a monetary\r\ncommutation of the tithe; for the wine being usually made of grapes\r\nfrom a dozen different sources, many of them beyond their domain, it\r\nwould be impossible to ascertain the proportion that was their due.\r\nThe Parliament of Paris decided, however, that the abbey might take\r\nthe fortieth of the wine a month after it was barrelled, unless the\r\nvine-growers preferred to give them the fortieth part of all the grapes\r\nbrought to the press. The fact was that the monks really wished to\r\ncheck the practice of mixing grapes from different districts at the\r\npress, for fear wine equal to their own should result from this plan,\r\nfirst satisfactorily put in practice by Dom Perignon. Arthur Young\r\nmentions that an arpent of vines at Pierry was valued at 2000 livres,\r\nhalf the price the same extent commanded at Hautvillers.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 391: M. Armand Bourgeois, in his work on _Le Sourdon et sa\r\nVallée_, mentions a local tradition to the effect that Saint Remi, who\r\nfrom his will is shown to have owned vinelands of some extent in a part\r\nof this district still known as the Evêché, installed a hermit in this\r\nsaid grotto of the Pierre de Saint Mamert to supervise his vineyards.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 392: Bertin du Rocheret writes thus in 1744, and adds that\r\nthe aspect of Avize had at that epoch become entirely changed by the\r\nnumerous fine 'maisons de vendange' erected there.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 393: In 1205 Gilbert Belon conferred an annual gift on the\r\nAbbey of St. Martin of seven hogsheads of _vinage_ derived from the\r\nvineyards of Oger.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 394:\r\n\r\n    'Je fus jadis de terre vertueuse\r\n    Nez de Virtuz, pais renommé,\r\n    Où il avait ville très gracieuse,\r\n    Dont li bon vin sont en maints lieux nommés.'\r\n\r\n    Eustache Deschamps' poem on the Burning of Vertus.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 395:\r\n\r\n    'Quant vient de si noble racine\r\n    Come du droit plan de Beaune,\r\n    Qui ne porte pas couleur jaune\r\n    Mais vermeille, franche, plaisant,\r\n    Qui fait tout autre odeur taisant,\r\n    Quand elle est aportée en place.'\r\n\r\nDeschamps' _La Charte des Bons Enfans de Vertus_.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 396:\r\n\r\n    'Si vous alez au benefice\r\n    Mieulx vous vauldra que ung clistère.'--Ibid.\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 397: In 1880 the Vertus wine realised the remarkably high\r\nprice of from 1200 to 1400 francs the pièce.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 398: St. Evremond's _Letters_ (London, 1728).]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 399: St. Simon's _Mémoires_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 400: Bertin du Rocheret's /MS./ extracts from the _Registre\r\ndes Assemblées du peuple de la ville d'Epernay_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 401: Henderson's _History of Ancient and Modern Wines_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 402: Arthur Young's _Travels in France in 1787-8-9_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 403: Anonymous _Journal de ce qui s'est passé d'intéressant à\r\nReims en 1814_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 404: Dom Chatelain, in his /MS./ notes on the _History of\r\nReims_, relates that Henri Quatre, being one day at Sully's, asked\r\nthe Minister for some breakfast, and after drinking a glass or two of\r\nwine, exclaimed, 'Ventre Saint Gris, this is a grand wine; it beats\r\nmine of Ay and all others. I should like to know where it comes from.'\r\n''Tis my friend Taissy,' answered Sully, 'who sends it to me.' 'Then\r\nI must be introduced to him,' said the King; which was accordingly\r\ndone. The wines of Taissy had a high reputation as late as the\r\neighteenth century. They were classed by St. Evremond and Brossette,\r\nthe commentator of Boileau, amongst the best vintages of the Champagne,\r\nand their reputation was maintained by the care bestowed by the Abbé\r\nGodinot on the vineyards which he owned here.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 405:\r\n\r\n    'Qu'Horace du Falerne entonne les louanges,\r\n        Que de son vieux Massique il vante les attraits;\r\n        Tous ces vins si fameux n'égaleront jamais\r\n    Du charmant Sillery les heureuses vendanges!'\r\n\r\nTranslation by Le Monnoye in the _Recueil des Poésies Latines et\r\nFrançaises_, &c., Paris, 1712.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 406: The wine of Verzenay, like that of Bouzy, owes much of\r\nits reputation to the example set in the eighteenth century by the\r\nAbbé Godinot, author of the _Mémoire_ on the cultivation of the grape\r\nand the manufacture of wine in the Champagne, published in 1711. He\r\nowned extensive vineyards at Verzenay and Bouzy, and his prolonged\r\ninvestigations as to the species of vines and composts best suited to\r\nthe district led to a complete revolution in the system of culture and\r\nmode of pressing the fruit. Bertin du Rocheret praises 'the excellent\r\nwine of Verzenay' served at the banquets celebrating the conclusion of\r\nthe assembly of the Etats de Vitry, held at Châlons in 1744.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 407: The value in 1880 of a hectare of vines, equivalent to\r\nnearly two and a half acres, was as follows:\r\n\r\n    At Verzy, Verzenay, and Sillery, 35 to 38,000 francs.\r\n    \"  Bouzy and Ambonnay,           38 \"  40,000   \"\r\n    \"  Ay and Dizy,                  40 \"  45,000   \"\r\n    \"  Hautvillers,                  20 \"  22,000   \"\r\n    \"  Pierry,                             18,000   \"\r\n    \"  Cramant and Avize,            38 \"  40,000   \"\r\n    \"  Le Mesnil,                    22 \"  25,000   \"\r\n]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 408: This was far from being the first appearance of the pest\r\nin this district. From 1779 to 1785 similar ravages drove the vignerons\r\nto despair; but the weather during the last-named year suddenly turning\r\nwet and cold, just at the epoch of the butterflies emerging from their\r\nchrysalids, the evil disappeared as though by enchantment, an event\r\nduly acknowledged by parochial rejoicings and religious processions. In\r\n1816 similar ravages took place; and from 1820 to 1830 the pyrale also\r\ncaused great devastation.\r\n\r\nIn the year 1613, Jehan Pussot, the local chronicler of Reims, notes\r\nthat a large proportion of the vines were destroyed by 'a great\r\nconcourse of worms,' which attacked those plants which the frost had\r\nspared. This would establish that either the pyrale or the cochylis\r\nwas known to the Champenois viticulturists at the commencement of the\r\nseventeenth century.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 409: In 1873, in all the higher-class vineyards, as much as\r\ntwo francs and a quarter per kilogramme (11_d._ per lb.) were paid,\r\nbeing more than treble the average price. And yet the vintage was a\r\nmost unsatisfactory one, owing to the deficiency of sun and abundance\r\nof wet throughout the summer. The market, however, was in great need\r\nof wine, and the fruit while still ungathered was bought up at most\r\nexorbitant prices by the _spéculateurs_ who supply the _vin brut_ to\r\nthe Champagne manufacturers.\r\n\r\nIn 1874 the grapes of the Mountain sold from at 55 to 160 francs the\r\ncaque, according to the crus; and those of the Côte d'Avize at from 1\r\nf. 25 c. to 2 f. per kilogramme. In 1875, on the other hand, grapes\r\ncould be obtained at Verzenay, Verzy, Ambonnay, and Bouzy at from 45 to\r\n55 francs the caque; and at Vertus, Le Mesnil, Oger, Grauves, Cramant,\r\nand Avize, at from 40 to 70 centimes the kilogramme. By far the highest\r\nprice secured by the growers for their grapes was in 1880, when the\r\nproduce of the grand crus of the Mountain fetched as much as 220 f. the\r\ncaque, equal to nearly 3 f. 60 c. the kilogramme, or about 1_s._ 5_d._\r\nper lb. It was, as usual, scarcity rather than quality that caused this\r\nunprecedented rise in price.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 410: M. Mauméné relates in his _Traité du Travail des Vins_\r\nthat on one occasion, when, as an experiment, 3000 first-class bottles,\r\nwhich had already been used, were employed anew, only fifteen or\r\nsixteen of the whole number resisted the pressure. Moreover, if much\r\nbroken glass is remelted down and used in the manufacture, the bottles\r\ndo not turn out well, the second fusion of silicates never having the\r\nsame cohesion as the first. The glass-works of Sèvres and Bercy, which\r\nmelt down most of the broken glass collected in Paris, have never been\r\nable to supply bottles strong enough for sparkling wines.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 411: Loivre is about seven miles from Reims on the road to\r\nLaon.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 412: It is calculated that wine, the grape sugar in which\r\nyields ten per cent of alcohol, according to the average in Champagne,\r\nwould, if bottled immediately after pressing, produce enough carbonic\r\nacid gas to develop a pressure of thirty-two atmospheres. But such\r\na pressure is never developed, as the wine is not bottled directly\r\nit leaves the press; besides which no bottle could stand it. From\r\nfour to six atmospheres insure a lively explosion and a brisk creamy\r\nfoam. It is necessary, therefore, that fermentation should have been\r\ncarried on till at least three-fourths of the sugar have been converted\r\ninto alcohol and carbonic acid gas before the wine is drawn off for\r\nbottling, for even the very best bottles burst under a pressure of\r\neight atmospheres.\r\n\r\nA few words on the origin and development of the effervescent\r\nproperties of Champagne will not be out of place here. These are due,\r\nas already explained, to the presence of a large quantity of carbonic\r\nacid gas, the evolution of which has been prevented by the bottling of\r\nthe wine prior to the end of the alcoholic fermentation. The source of\r\ncarbonic acid gas exists in all wines, and they may be all rendered\r\nsparkling by the same method of treatment. Still, no effervescent wine\r\ncan compare with the finest growths of the Champagne, for these possess\r\nthe especial property of retaining a large portion of their sugar\r\nduring, and even after, fermentation; besides which, the soil imparts a\r\nnative bouquet that no other wine can match.\r\n\r\nCarbonic acid gas is one of the two products of the fermentation of\r\ngrape sugar, the other being alcohol. In wine fermented in casks it\r\nrises to the surface, and escapes through the bunghole left open for\r\nthe purpose. The case is different with wine fermenting in bottles\r\ntightly secured by corks. Part of the gas developed rises into the\r\nchamber or vacant space left in the bottle, where, mingling with the\r\natmospheric air, it exercises a constantly increasing pressure on the\r\nsurface of the wine. This pressure at length becomes so strong as to\r\nkeep all the gas subsequently formed dissolved in the wine itself,\r\nwhich it saturates, as it were, and thereby converts into sparkling\r\nwine. Upon the bottle being opened, the gas accumulated in the chamber\r\nrushes into the air, producing a slight explosion, or pop, and freeing\r\nfrom pressure the gas which had remained dissolved in the wine, and\r\nwhich in turn escapes in the shape of numberless tiny bubbles, forming\r\nthe foam so pleasing to the eye on rising to the surface.\r\n\r\nSometimes on opening a bottle of Champagne the pop is loud, but the\r\neffervescence feeble and transitory; and, on the other hand, there\r\nis merely a slight explosion, and yet the wine froths and sparkles\r\nvigorously and continuously. The two bottles may contain the same\r\nquantity of gas, but in the one there is more in the chamber and\r\nless dissolved in the wine, and hence the loud pop and slight\r\nsparkle; while in the other the pressure is low, and the explosion\r\nconsequently slighter, but there is more gas in the wine itself, and\r\nthe effervescence is proportionately greater and more lasting. In the\r\nformer case the wine has received the addition of, or has contained\r\nfrom the outset, some matter calculated to diminish its power of\r\ndissolving carbonic acid gas, and is unsuitable for making good\r\nsparkling wine. The nature of the effervescence is one of the best\r\ntests of the quality of the wine. Gas naturally dissolved does not all\r\nescape at once on the removal of the pressure, but, on the contrary,\r\nabout two-thirds of it are retained by the viscidity of the wine. The\r\nbetter and more natural the wine, the more intimately the carbonic acid\r\ngas remains dissolved in it, and the finer its bubbles.\r\n\r\nThe form of the glass out of which Champagne is drunk has an influence\r\non its effervescence. The wine sparkles far better in a glass\r\nterminating in a point, like the old-fashioned _flûte_, or the modern\r\ngoblet or patera, with a hollow stem, than in one with a rounded\r\nbottom. The reason is that any point formed around the liquid, as\r\ninstanced in the pointed bottoms of these glasses, or in the liquid,\r\nas may be proved by putting the end of a pointed glass rod into\r\nthe wine, favours the disengagement of the gas. Powder of any kind\r\npresents a number of tiny points, and hence the dropping of a little\r\npowdered sugar into Champagne excites effervescence. Porous bodies\r\nlike bread-crumbs produce the same effect. Even dust has a similar\r\naction; and the wine will froth better in a badly-wiped glass than in\r\none perfectly clean, though it would hardly do to put forward such an\r\nexcuse as this for using dirty goblets.\r\n\r\nThe lively pop of the cork is less esteemed in England than in certain\r\ncircles in France, where many hosts would be sadly disappointed if the\r\nwine they put before their guests did not go off with a loud bang,\r\ncausing the ladies to scream and the gentlemen to laugh. A brisk foam,\r\ntoo, is absolutely necessary for the prestige of the wine, and 'grand\r\nmousseux' is a quality much sought after by the general public on the\r\nother side of the Channel. It is not rare to meet with wines of a high\r\nclass in which the removal of the cork produces a loud explosion; but\r\nunfortunately the brisk report and sharp but transitory rush of foam\r\nare features easily imparted by artificial means. The ordinary white\r\nwines of Lorraine and other provinces receive a certain addition of\r\nspirit and liqueur, and are then artificially charged with carbonic\r\nacid gas obtained from carbonate of lime, chalk, and similar materials,\r\nafter the fashion in which soda-water is made. These wines, sold as\r\nChampagne, eject their corks with a loud pop, but three-fourths of the\r\ncarbonic acid gas escape at the same time, and the wine soon becomes\r\nflat and dead; whereas a naturally sparkling wine of good quality\r\nleft open for three hours and then recorked will be found fresh and\r\ndrinkable the next day.\r\n\r\nBoth the explosion and the subsequent effervescence are aided by a high\r\ntemperature, which assists the development of the gas. Cold has the\r\nopposite effect, and iced wine neither pops nor sparkles. It, however,\r\nretains, if genuine, the whole of the carbonic acid gas held dissolved,\r\nwhich is not the case with the imitations spoken of.\r\n\r\nWere it not that the question has been seriously started on more than\r\none occasion, and only solved to the satisfaction of the questioner\r\nby a chemico-anatomical explanation, it would hardly be worth while\r\ntouching upon the supposed hurtfulness of the carbonic acid gas\r\ncontained in sparkling wines. The fact of accidents frequently\r\noccurring in breweries, distilleries, wine-presses, &c., from the\r\naccumulation of this gas, to breathe which for a few seconds is mortal,\r\nhas led some people to wonder how Champagne, whilst containing so\r\nlarge a proportion of it, can be swallowed with impunity. The gas,\r\nhowever, which produces fatal results when inhaled into the lungs,\r\nby depriving the blood of the oxygen which it should find there, has\r\nin the stomach a beneficial effect, serving to promote digestion. In\r\ndrinking Champagne it is conveyed direct to this latter region, so that\r\nno danger whatever exists, any more than in the mineral waters.--Mainly\r\ncondensed from E. J. Mauméné's _Traité du Travail des Vins_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 413: For a long time the most erroneous ideas as to the cause\r\nof such breakage and the means of preventing it prevailed. Tasting,\r\nwhich was most relied on for ascertaining how far fermentation had\r\ngone, could not be depended upon with accuracy, though the rule of\r\nthumb laid down by some makers was that the time to bottle with the\r\nleast risk of breakage was when the sweet taste had disappeared, and\r\nvinous flavour developed itself. The aerometers subsequently introduced\r\nfailed to answer the purpose, because the saccharine matter was not\r\nthe only thing capable of influencing them. The result usually was\r\neither the bottling of a must so full of effervescence as to break\r\nthe bottles, or of wine already completely fermented and incapable of\r\neffervescing at all.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 414: In some establishments tables made after the same\r\nfashion replace the racks, whilst another plan of coaxing the sediment\r\ndown towards the cork is to stack the bottles at the outset in double\r\nrows, with their necks inclining downwards, laths placed between each\r\nlayer maintaining them in their position. This method effects a great\r\neconomy of time and space, the bottles requiring on an average only\r\na few days on the racks prior to shipment to thoroughly complete the\r\noperation.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 415: As the real origin of this system is a matter which has\r\nexcited no small amount of controversy, and as several claimants to the\r\nhonour of its discovery have had their names put forward by different\r\nwriters, the following extracts from a letter from M. Alfred Werlé, of\r\nthe house founded by Madame Clicquot, may serve to render honour where\r\nit is really due: 'Already, in 1806 (I am unable to speak of an earlier\r\nperiod with absolute certainty), the bottles were placed on tables,\r\nlike to-day, with their heads downwards; each bottle being taken out\r\nof its hole, raised in the air, and shaken with the hand, so as to\r\ncause the cream of tartar and the deposit it contained to fall upon the\r\ncork, the holes being round, and the bottles placed straight downwards.\r\nThis lasted till 1818, when a man named Müller, an employé of Madame\r\nClicquot, suggested to her that the bottles should be left in the table\r\nwhilst being shaken, and that the holes should be cut obliquely, so\r\nthat the bottles might remain inclined. He maintained that one would\r\nthus obtain a wine of far greater limpidity. The trial was made, and\r\nevery day, with a view of keeping this new process a secret, Müller and\r\nMadame Clicquot shut themselves up alone in the cellars, and shook the\r\nbottles unperceived. In 1821 Müller was assisted by a workman named\r\nMathieu Binder; and in 1823 or 1824, Madame Clicquot having purchased\r\nfrom M. Morizet a _cuvée_ of wine which was shaken and prepared in\r\nthis merchant's cellars, one of his employés named Thomassin became\r\nacquainted with the new method, and resolved to practise it; since\r\nwhen it gradually spread, and eventually was generally adopted. M.\r\nWerlé senior recollects perfectly well that when he arrived at Madame\r\nClicquot's in 1821 it was only at her establishment that the bottles\r\nwere shaken in this manner. The practice of shaking the bottles was a\r\nvery old one, and no more invented by Müller than by Thomassin; but the\r\nformer certainly effected great improvements by employing the system\r\nof oblique holes, and shaking the bottles in the table and not in the\r\nair.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 416: M. Mauméné has pointed out that if a solution of\r\ntannin or alum has been added to the _cuvée_ at the time of fining,\r\nthe deposit is certain to be granular and non-adherent. But he justly\r\nremarks that these solutions, especially the latter, though doing good\r\nto the wine, have a precisely opposite effect upon the human stomach\r\nthat consumes it.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 417: The Regiment de Champagne was one of the most famous of\r\nthe _vieux corps_, and claimed to be the second oldest regiment in the\r\nFrench army.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 418: The system of dosing the wine does not appear to have\r\nbeen practised prior to the present century.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 419: The high favour in which sugar-candy is held for\r\nmixing with this Champagne liqueur dates from the latter part of the\r\nlast century, when there was a perfect mania for everything in a\r\ncrystallised form, as being the height of condensation and purity. The\r\ncompetition between the first houses of Reims and Epernay to secure\r\nthe largest and finest crystals was very keen, and it was considered\r\ndisgraceful for any firm of standing to make use of sugar-candy of a\r\nyellow tinge or in small crystals. Latterly it has been demonstrated\r\nthat these expensive crystals contain more water and less saccharine\r\nmatter than an equal weight of loaf-sugar, and that they sometimes\r\ncontain a glutinous element capable of imparting an insipid flavour to\r\nthe wine.--Mauméné's _Traité du Travail des Vins_.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 420: Instances have been known of additions of 25 and even 30\r\nper cent of liqueur, though the average may be taken to be for Germany\r\nand France, 15 to 18 per cent; America, 10 to 15 per cent; England, 2\r\nto 6 per cent.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 421: The corrosive action of rust upon the wire has led to\r\nseveral attempts to replace it, and some Champagne houses have adopted\r\nmore or less ingenious appliances of metal, &c. Tinned iron wire has\r\nbeen found to resist rust, but is too expensive; whilst an experiment\r\nwith galvanised wire resulted in serious illness amongst the workmen\r\nhandling it, owing to the poisonous fumes evolved by the zinc when\r\nacted upon by the acids of the wine.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 422: M.

The prevalent opinion is that it bore the inscription\r\n_Dei merito_, translated as Dieu le mérite, which became corrupted into\r\nDieu-Lumière. Under Louis XI. it certainly figures as Di Merito.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 427: A curious old engraving copied from an ancient tapestry\r\nrepresents the entry of the royal procession into Reims through the\r\nPorte Dieu-Lumière.

In the list of\r\nexpenses incurred on the passage of Louis XVI. and his family, four\r\nhundred livres are set down to 'the Sieur Memmie Cousin, innkeeper and\r\nmerchant at Epernay, for the dinner of the king, the queen, and the\r\nroyal family, as well as for an indemnity for the furniture broken at\r\nthe said Cousin's.'\r\n\r\nAs regards the price of the wines of the River during the Revolutionary\r\nepoch, an old account-book of Messrs. Moët & Chandon shows that in 1797\r\nthe firm paid for the white wine of Epernay and Avize 200 francs, for\r\nthat of Chouilly 180 francs, and for that of Pierry and Cramant 150\r\nfrancs per pièce; whilst that of Ay cost from 565 to 600 francs the\r\nqueue.

Amongst its inhabitants\r\nwere the Marquis Tirant de Flavigny, Dubois de Livry, Quatresols de la\r\nMotte, De Lastre d'Aubigny, De Lantage, &c., most of whose residences\r\nare still extant. In October 1792 several accusations were made against\r\nsoldiers for picking and eating grapes in the vineyards of Pierry and\r\nMoussy, belonging to Cazotte, De la Motte, De Lantage, D'Aubigny, &c.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 451: Part of it now serves as the 'maison communale' and\r\nschool-house of the village.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 452: Arrested at Pierry in August 1792, in consequence of the\r\ndiscovery, on the sacking of the Tuileries, of a new plan of escape\r\nfor the royal family, sent by him to his friend Ponteau, secretary of\r\nthe Civil List, Cazotte was brought to Paris and immured, in company\r\nwith his daughter Elizabeth, in the prison of the Abbaye. Arraigned\r\nbefore the self-constituted tribunal presided over by the butcher\r\nMaillard, on the night of the 3d September, the fatal words 'To La\r\nForce,' equivalent to a sentence of death, were pronounced; and Cazotte\r\nwas about to fall beneath the sabres already raised against him, when\r\nElizabeth covered his body with her own, and by her heroic appeals\r\ninduced the assassins to forego their prey. She even had the courage to\r\ndrink with them to the Republic, and with her father was escorted home\r\nin triumph. A few days later, however, he was rearrested, condemned to\r\ndeath by the Revolutionary Tribunal, and on the 25th September ascended\r\nthe scaffold, from whence he cried with a firm voice to the multitude,\r\n'I die as I have lived, faithful to God and my king.'\r\n\r\nUnder date of the 10 Prairial An II. (1793), the citizen Bourbon was\r\nappointed by the municipality of Pierry to cultivate the vineyards 'du\r\ngillotiné (_sic_) Cazotte.']\r\n\r\n[Footnote 453: In 1775 the Abbot of Hautvillers, as _décimateur_ of\r\nPierry, claimed to take tithe of a fortieth of all wines in the cellars\r\nof the village. This claim being rejected by the baillage of Epernay\r\nin 1777, he appealed to the Parliament of Paris. Cazotte undertook\r\nthe case of his fellow-proprietors, pleading that the abbey, which,\r\naccording to strict law, was bound to take the tithe in the shape of\r\ngrapes left at the foot of each vine, had long since replaced this\r\nby a monetary commutation; and that the inhabitants of Pierry, like\r\nthe other wine-growers of the Champagne, being 'obliged, in order to\r\nobtain perfection in their wines, to mix the grapes of several crus and\r\ndifferent tithings, it would be impossible to tithe the wine itself.'\r\nHe also argued that the question had been settled by a decision on the\r\nsame point in favour of the inhabitants of Ay and Dizy. However, the\r\nmonks obtained a decree from parliament authorising them to take the\r\nfortieth of the vintage a month after the wines had been barrelled,\r\nunless the wine-growers preferred 'to pay the tithe at the wine-press,\r\nin form of the fortieth load of grapes free from all mixture.' The\r\ninhabitants appealed in 1780, pleading the impossibility of this\r\nplan of tithing at the press, on account of the expense and of the\r\ndifficulty of sorting out the grapes from those brought from Moussy,\r\nVinay, Monthelon, Cuis, Epernay, and other districts in which they had\r\nalso vineyards. The Revolution cut the Gordian knot of this affair,\r\nwhich really arose from the wish of the monks to hinder as much as\r\npossible that plan of mixing grapes from different sources, to which\r\nthe perfection of their own wine was due.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 454: In January 1790 the inhabitants of Pierry unanimously\r\nelected Cazotte their first mayor under the new _régime_. A decree\r\nsigned by him in this capacity, and dated April 11, 1790, fixes the\r\nprice for a day's work in the vineyards at 12 sols. In 1793 the\r\nmunicipality of the adjoining district of Moussy fixed the day's\r\nhire of the vintager at 25 sous, of horses employed in the vintage\r\nat 7 livres 10 sous, and of asses at 5 livres. As regards the price\r\nof the local cru, amongst the items of the accounts of the syndic of\r\nMoussy for the years 1787-8 is the following: 'For thirteen bottles\r\nof stringed wine (vin fisselé) sent to Paris to the procureur of the\r\ncommunity (Failly lawsuit), 13 livres.' The community were then engaged\r\nin a lawsuit with the Count de Failly respecting a wood. During the\r\nRevolutionary epoch it was decreed by the municipality of Pierry that a\r\nvineyard known as les Rennes should, on account of the resemblance to\r\nles Reines, be in future styled les Sans-culottes. It has since resumed\r\nits old name.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 455: The story of Cazotte prophesying not only his own\r\nfate, but that of the king and queen, Condorcet, Bailly, Malesherbes,\r\nNicolai, the Duchess de Grammont, and others who perished during the\r\nTerror, at a dinner given at an Academician's in 1788, has been proved\r\nto be a mere invention on the part of La Harpe. Nevertheless there\r\nseems but little doubt that he distinctly foresaw many coming evils;\r\nand a native of Pierry, M. Armand Bourgeois, asserts that his maternal\r\ngrandfather was one day at Cazotte's house in the village, when the\r\nentire company were completely upset by their host's prophecies of a\r\ncoming revolution.]\r\n\r\n[Footnote 456: P.
